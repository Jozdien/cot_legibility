# Original Question

Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

The photon is the particle not associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry. Here's why:

1. **Spontaneously-Broken Symmetry**: This occurs when a system's vacuum state does not respect the symmetry of its fundamental laws. Examples include the Higgs mechanism (electroweak symmetry breaking), which gives mass to W and Z bosons, and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, which leads to pions as pseudo-Goldstone bosons. The Higgs boson also arises from this process.

2. **Photon's Role**: The photon is the gauge boson of the unbroken U(1) electromagnetic symmetry in the Standard Model. Unlike the W and Z bosons, the photon remains massless because the symmetry it represents (electromagnetism) is **not spontaneously broken**—it is the residual symmetry after electroweak symmetry breaking.

3. **Gluons**: Similarly, gluons are massless gauge bosons of the unbroken SU(3) color symmetry in QCD, but they are not typically listed in such questions as they interact via a confining force.

4. **Effective Particles**: While quasiparticles like phonons (Goldstone modes of broken translational symmetry) or magnons (Goldstone modes of broken rotational symmetry) are tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking, the photon in the Standard Model is a fundamental particle with no such association.

**Answer**: The photon.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Alright, so I need to figure out which of the effective particles listed isn't associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Hmm, let me recall what I know about spontaneous symmetry breaking and particles related to that. 

First off, spontaneous symmetry breaking happens when the underlying laws of a system have a certain symmetry, but the system's ground state (or vacuum state) doesn't respect that symmetry. When this happens, you get massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons appearing, right? But if the symmetry is a gauge symmetry, then those bosons get "eaten" by the gauge bosons, giving them mass via the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson itself is the remaining particle after this process. 

So, particles associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking would include things like the Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which are typically absorbed by gauge bosons to become massive. In the Standard Model, the Higgs field breaks the electroweak symmetry, and the Higgs boson is the physical remnant. 

Now, the question is asking which particle isn't associated with spontaneously-broken symmetry. But wait, the options aren't listed here. Since I don't have the options, I might need to think about common examples given in such questions. Typically, effective particles associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking include the Higgs boson, pions (as they are pseudo-Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD), maybe phonons in a solid (as Goldstone modes of broken translational symmetry), or perhaps magnons in magnetic materials (broken rotational symmetry). 

On the other hand, particles like the photon are gauge bosons of an unbroken symmetry (electromagnetism has U(1) symmetry which isn't spontaneously broken in the Standard Model). Similarly, gluons are massless gauge bosons of the unbroken SU(3) color symmetry. So if one of the options is a photon or gluon, they wouldn't be associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Maybe something like the Z boson? Wait, but the Z boson gains mass through the Higgs mechanism, which is spontaneous symmetry breaking. So the Z and W bosons are connected to symmetry breaking.

Alternatively, in a superconductor, the photon becomes massive (as a result of the Anderson-Higgs mechanism), but that's in a superconducting medium, not in the Standard Model vacuum. If the question is within the Standard Model context, the photon remains massless. So perhaps the photon in the Standard Model is not associated with symmetry breaking. Wait, but the Standard Model's electroweak symmetry breaking gives masses to W and Z, but leaves the photon massless because the symmetry breaking leaves a residual U(1) electromagnetism unbroken. Therefore, the photon is the result of the unbroken symmetry.

So particles like the photon (and gluon) are from unbroken symmetries, hence not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Higgs boson, W, Z bosons, and possibly pions (if they're in the options) are from symmetry breaking. Therefore, if the answer is, say, the photon, then it's not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

But since the question mentions "effective" particles, that might hint at quasiparticles like phonons, which are Goldstone bosons. Hmm. Wait, maybe the distinction is between fundamental particles and effective (emergent) ones? For example, in solids, phonons are emergent Goldstone modes of broken translational symmetry, so they're associated with symmetry breaking. If one of the options is something like, maybe the electron? But electrons are fundamental fermions, and they gain their mass via the Higgs mechanism too, so that's tied to symmetry breaking. 

But if the question is about which isn't linked, the key would be to pick a particle from an unbroken symmetry. So going back, the photon in the Standard Model (not in a superconductor) is from an unbroken U(1) symmetry, so it's not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

So the answer depends on the options given, but if the question gives as options: photon, Higgs boson, pions, and say, magnons, then photon is the one not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Alternatively, maybe the graviton? But gravitons aren't part of the Standard Model.

Wait, since the user's actual question is simply "Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?" but since they pasted the same question again, maybe it's part of an interrupted input. Maybe the options are in an image or something else, but as a text-only user, I can't see them. Given that, perhaps the standard answer in such cases is the photon. Alternatively, I need to think about other possible particles. For instance, if "effective particles" refers to quasiparticles like phonons, magnons, etc., which are Goldstone bosons. Then, for example, the roton or another quasiparticle might not be, but typically phonons and magnons are. Alternatively, maybe a plasmon? Plasmon is a quantization of plasma oscillations. Not sure about its relation to symmetry breaking.

Alternatively, in particle physics, if we have Higgs (symmetry breaking), W and Z (gotten mass via symmetry breaking), pions (chiral symmetry breaking), then perhaps if one of the options is the photon or gluon, which are massless gauge bosons of unbroken symmetries. Alternatively, the neutrino? Wait, neutrino masses might come from a different mechanism, perhaps involving symmetry breaking (like the seesaw mechanism involving a heavy Higgs), but if they are considered as having a Majorana mass, then that requires breaking of lepton number, which is a global symmetry. But Dirac neutrinos get their mass like other fermions through Yukawa coupling with the Higgs, which is tied to symmetry breaking.

So in any case, the main candidates for particles not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking are the massless gauge bosons: photon and gluon. But gluons are in QCD, which is SU(3) unbroken, so their gauge symmetry is not broken. However, in QCD, chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, producing pions as pseudo-Goldstone bosons. So SU(3) color is unbroken, but chiral symmetry is broken. Therefore, gluons are linked to the unbroken symmetry.

So if the options are H, pions, W, Z, photon. Then photon is the one not associated.

Therefore, the answer is probably the photon. But since without seeing the options, this is speculative.

Wait, but the original question mentions "effective" particles. The term "effective" could imply that they are quasiparticles or emergent phenomena in a medium, but I suppose even within particle physics, some particles are considered effective. For example, in low-energy QCD, pions are considered as effective degrees of freedom. The Higgs is a fundamental particle but also part of the effective theory (the Standard Model is an effective field theory too, up to some scale). Alternatively, in superconductivity, the Anderson-Higgs mechanism gives an effective massive photon. But in the Standard Model, photon is a gauge boson of an unbroken symmetry. So maybe the answer is photon? But maybe not. Suppose if the options included phonons, Higgs, pions, and, say, something else. It's hard to say without the exact options.

Another thought: the pion is actually a pseudo-Goldstone boson. If the symmetry wasn't explicitly broken, they would be massless. Due to the quark masses (explicit breaking), they acquire a small mass. So maybe the pion is associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry, not the explicit one, and hence the answer. But maybe others. Alternatively, the eta prime meson is not a Goldstone boson because the axial symmetry is explicitly broken by the anomaly. Wait, but that's more specific.

Alternatively, massive particles might come from various sources. Fermion masses are from Yukawa couplings to the Higgs, so they acquire mass due to spontaneous symmetry breaking as well. So electrons, quarks are connected to symmetry breaking. The Higgs is connected, W and Z. Photons and gluons are connected to unbroken symmetry.

So, if you have to choose which particle doesn't have its origin in spontaneous symmetry breaking, then the photon. Since it's from an unbroken symmetry. Therefore, even though it's part of the Standard Model, it doesn't have a mass due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. So in that case, the answer is photon.

But wait, given that the user specified "effective" particles. Hmm. If "effective" is stressed, maybe phonons or something else. The other way: the Higgs is a fundamental particle (but maybe sometimes considered an effective degree of freedom). The pion is an effective particle (as a composite), phonons are effective.

So, maybe the question wants phonons (which are Goldstone bosons) vs others. If they say which is not associated, and we have photon as an option, maybe answer is photon. However, if option is the Higgs, which is a remnant of symmetry breaking. Ok.

Alternatively, perhaps if there was an option of a "massive vector boson" like W or Z, but in the question everything is phrased as particles. So, if the answer options are  for example phonon, pion, Higgs, and the photon. Then photon would be the answer.

Wait, but pions and Higgs are Goldstone or related to SSB. Phonons (if considered) Goldstone. But photons are not. Therefore, photon is the one not associated.

If this is correct, then even though in different contexts photons can be affected by symmetry breaking (like in superconductors), in the Standard Model, the photon is the gauge boson of unbroken symmetry. Hence, the answer is photon.

But since the initial question is a bit unclear without options, but given the context of standard exams, the usual suspects are photon. So, unless considering some other effective particles, but given the user's instruction, I have to assume the answer's probably photon.

Okay, let me think about this for a moment. Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when a system's laws exhibit a particular symmetry, but the ground state or vacuum state of the system doesn't maintain that symmetry. As a result of this symmetry breaking, massless particles called Nambu-Goldstone bosons emerge. However, if the broken symmetry is a gauge symmetry, the Nambu-Goldstone bosons are absorbed by the gauge bosons, which acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson is the particle that remains after this process.

In the context of the Standard Model, the Higgs field is responsible for breaking the electroweak symmetry, and the Higgs boson is the physical manifestation of this symmetry breaking. Other particles commonly associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking include pions (pseudo-Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD), phonons in solids (Goldstone modes of broken translational symmetry), and magnons in magnetic materials (resulting from broken rotational symmetry).

On the other hand, some particles are not directly linked to spontaneously broken symmetries. For instance, the photon is the gauge boson of the unbroken U(1) symmetry of electromagnetism in the Standard Model. Similarly, gluons are the massless gauge bosons of the unbroken SU(3) color symmetry. If the question's options include either the photon or gluon, they would not be associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking within the Standard Model framework.

The Z and W bosons, however, gain their mass through the Higgs mechanism, which is a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the case of superconductors, the photon acquires mass due to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, but this occurs in the superconducting medium and not in the Standard Model vacuum. If the question is asked within the context of the Standard Model, the photon remains massless and is not directly connected to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine which of the effective particles mentioned isn't connected to a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Let's see what I remember about spontaneous symmetry breaking and the particles linked to it.

To begin with, spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the fundamental laws of a system exhibit a certain symmetry, but the system's ground state (or vacuum state) doesn't uphold that symmetry. In this scenario, massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons emerge, right? However, if the symmetry in question is a gauge symmetry, those bosons are "absorbed" by gauge bosons, which then gain mass through the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson is the leftover particle following this process.

So, particles linked to spontaneous symmetry breaking would include Nambu-Goldstone bosons, often absorbed by gauge bosons to become massive. In the Standard Model, the electroweak symmetry is broken by the Higgs field, leaving the Higgs boson as the tangible remnant.

Now, the task is to identify which particle isn't tied to spontaneously-broken symmetry. Unfortunately, the options aren't provided here. Considering common examples in similar questions might help. Typically, particles connected to spontaneous symmetry breaking include the Higgs boson, pions (pseudo-Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD), possibly phonons in solids (Goldstone modes from broken translational symmetry), or magnons in magnetic materials (broken rotational symmetry).

On the flip side, particles like the photon are gauge bosons of an unbroken symmetry (with U(1) symmetry in electromagnetism remaining intact in the Standard Model). Similarly, gluons are massless gauge bosons of the unbroken SU(3) color symmetry. Therefore, if one of the options is a photon or gluon, they wouldn't be related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Maybe the Z boson? But wait, the Z boson gains mass via the Higgs mechanism, which involves spontaneous symmetry breaking. So, the Z and W bosons are related to symmetry breaking.

Alternatively, in a superconductor, the photon gains mass through the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, but that's specific to a superconducting environment, not within the Standard Model vacuum. In the Standard Model context, the photon is massless, so it might not be associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

The particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is the **photon**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB)**: This occurs when a system's ground state does not respect the symmetry of its underlying laws. This results in massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons (or pseudo-Goldstone bosons if the symmetry is approximate). In gauge theories, these bosons are "eaten" by gauge bosons to give them mass (Higgs mechanism).

2. **Particles Associated with SSB**:
   - **Higgs boson**: Emerges as the remnant of the electroweak symmetry breaking (SU(2) × U(1) → U(1) electromagnetism).
   - **W and Z bosons**: Gain mass via the Higgs mechanism.
   - **Pions**: Pseudo-Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.
   - **Phonons/magnons**: Goldstone modes in condensed matter systems (e.g., broken translational/rotational symmetry).

3. **Photon**: The photon is the gauge boson of the unbroken U(1) electromagnetic symmetry in the Standard Model. Since the U(1) symmetry remains unbroken after electroweak symmetry breaking, the photon remains massless and is **not** tied to SSB. In contrast, the Z and W bosons acquire mass through SSB.

**Conclusion**: The photon is the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

with a spontaneously broken symmetry. 

Wait, but in the electroweak theory, the Higgs breaks SU(2)×U(1) down to U(1)em. So the original U(1) of hypercharge and SU(2) are broken to the electromagnetic U(1). So the photon is a combination of the SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields, and remains massless because the U(1)em is unbroken. Therefore, the photon is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry, whereas the W and Z bosons are. 

So if the options include photon, then that would be the answer. Similarly, gluons, as mentioned before, are from unbroken SU(3) symmetry. But maybe the question is about effective particles in condensed matter versus particle physics. For example, phonons, which are Goldstone bosons of broken translational symmetry, so they are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Magnons, similarly, are Goldstone bosons of broken spin rotational symmetry. 

So perhaps a particle that isn't a Goldstone boson or a massive gauge boson. For instance, in the Standard Model, quarks and leptons get their masses through Yukawa coupling with the Higgs, but they themselves are not a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking. But the question says "effective particles," which might refer to quasiparticles or collective excitations rather than fundamental particles. 

Wait, the question says "effective" particles. So maybe we're talking about quasiparticles here. For example, in a superconductor, Cooper pairs are part of the condensate, and the Higgs mechanism gives the photon a mass. Phonons are Goldstone bosons. Electrons in a Fermi liquid are Landau quasiparticles. So maybe Landau quasiparticles are not related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. But I need to be careful.

Alternatively, if we consider the pion as an effective particle (which they are in low-energy QCD), pions are the Goldstone bosons of the chiral symmetry breaking. So they are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Higgs is as well. The Higgs is the remnant of the broken symmetry. The W and Z bosons are massive due to the Higgs mechanism, so they are associated with SSB. The photon isn't. Gluons aren't. 

But the question is about effective particles. Wait, maybe in some contexts, like in the context of the chiral perturbation theory, pions are effective Goldstone bosons. But the Higgs is a fundamental particle, though in some theories it could be composite. But I think the term "effective particles" here might be refer to quasiparticles or emergent particles in condensed matter. For example, phonons, magnons, anyons, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing particle physics and condensed matter examples. For example, if the options are Higgs boson, pion, phonon, and, say, electron, then the electron is not associated with SSB. But since the question is about effective particles, maybe the answer is the electron isn't an effective particle. But if it's an effective particle, like in a certain theory... Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the proton? But protons are composite particles, not associated with SSB. Wait, but they are bound states of quarks. Not sure. Wait, perhaps the question is from a particle physics perspective. Let me recall: The Higgs is associated with SSB. The W and Z bosons are massive due to SSB. The pion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson (chiral symmetry breaking). The photon is not. The gluon is not. The graviton (if considered) is not. So if the options include the photon, then that's the answer. But since the question is about "effective" particles, maybe it's in a different context.

Wait, another thought: In some theories, like technicolor, the Higgs is a composite particle arising from a new strong interaction, so it's an effective particle. But in the Standard Model, it's fundamental. If the question is considering the Higgs as an effective particle, then it's still associated with SSB. 

Alternatively, in cosmology, cosmic strings or other topological defects are associated with SSB, but they're not particles. Maybe the question is not about those. 

Wait, maybe I need to think of the effective particles as emergent in some effective field theory. For instance, in Fermi liquid theory, the Landau quasiparticles are effective particles, but they don't have to do with SSB. Phonons, on the other hand, are Goldstone bosons. So in that case, if the options include Landau quasiparticles, then they are not associated with SSB. But I don't know the options here. 

Alternatively, if the question is from a standard particle physics perspective, then the photon is the answer. But since the user hasn't provided the options, I need to make an educated guess. Since the user has asked this question in the style of a multiple-choice but without options, perhaps the intended answer is the photon. Or maybe the pion, but pions are associated with SSB. Wait, pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons of the chiral symmetry breaking, which is a spontaneous symmetry breaking. So they are associated with SSB. The Higgs is associated with SSB. The W and Z are as well. The photon isn't. So likely, the answer is the photon. But again, the user hasn't given the options. 

Wait, the question says "effective particles". If "effective" here refers to composite particles or quasiparticles, maybe in a different context. For example, in superconductivity, the Cooper pairs are part of the condensate (so related to SSB), and the Anderson-Higgs mechanism gives the photon a mass. But in the Standard Model, the photon is massless. So if we have a photon in a superconductor (which is a massive "photon"), that's due to SSB, but the regular photon in the vacuum is not. So depending on context. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the graviton. But gravitons are hypothetical and not part of the Standard Model. They are associated with diffeomorphism symmetry, which isn't spontaneously broken in general relativity. 

Alternatively, if the question is from a condensed matter perspective, maybe something like a hole in a semiconductor. Holes are effective particles, but they aren't related to SSB. Phonons and magnons are. So if the options include holes, then that's the answer. 

But given that the user hasn't provided options, I need to consider the most probable answer. In particle physics, the most common particles associated with SSB are the Higgs, W, Z, and Goldstone bosons (like pions). Particles not associated are photons, gluons, and fermions (like electrons, quarks). But the fermions get their masses via Yukawa coupling with the Higgs, but the fermions themselves aren't a result of SSB. However, the question is about "effective particles". If effective here means they arise as effective degrees of freedom from SSB, then the Higgs and pions are effective in certain effective theories. 

Alternatively, if the question is from the perspective of the Standard Model, the photon is a gauge boson of an unbroken symmetry, hence not associated. So in a typical question like this, if the options are Higgs, Pion, Phonon, and Photon, the answer would be Photon. But again, without knowing the options, this is speculative. 

But given the standard pedagogical question, the common answer is the photon. Hence, I think the answer is the photon.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The photon is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry in the context of the Standard Model of particle physics. Spontaneous symmetry breaking typically gives rise to Nambu-Goldstone bosons (or their analogs) or massive gauge bosons when combined with gauge symmetry. For example:

- **Higgs boson**: Emerges from the electroweak symmetry breaking.
- **W and Z bosons**: Gain mass via the Higgs mechanism (broken electroweak symmetry).
- **Pions**: Pseudo-Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.
- **Phonons/magnons**: Quasiparticles (effective particles) arising from broken translational or rotational symmetry in condensed matter systems.

In contrast, the **photon** corresponds to the unbroken \( U(1)_{\text{EM}} \) gauge symmetry in the Standard Model and remains massless. While photons in superconductors acquire an effective mass due to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, this is a condensed matter effect. The question likely refers to fundamental particles, where the photon is the answer. 

**Answer:** The photon.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Therefore, if the options given are Higgs boson, pion, phonon, magnon, photon, gluon, W boson, Z boson, then the photon and gluon are not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, since gluons are confined and not observed as free particles, but their masslessness is due to the unbroken SU(3) symmetry. The photon, similarly, is massless because electromagnetism's U(1) symmetry remains unbroken. So, among these, the photon and gluon would be the ones not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. But the question asks for which one is "not associated," so depending on the options given, the answer would be photon or gluon. However, since gluons are part of the strong force which is unbroken, and photon is part of the unbroken electromagnetic symmetry. If the question includes, say, the Higgs boson, pion, phonon, magnon, and photon, then photon is the answer. But without knowing the exact options, I need to recall typical such questions. Often, in particle physics contexts, the photon is the answer here because the Higgs is associated with symmetry breaking, W and Z bosons gain mass from it, pions are Goldstone bosons (though pseudo), and phonons/magnons are condensed matter examples. So the odd one out would be the photon. Alternatively, if gluons are an option, they would also be unbroken. But since gluons are confined, maybe the question refers to effective particles. Hmm. Wait, the question says "effective" particles. Effective particles could refer to quasiparticles like phonons and magnons, which are Goldstone modes. So perhaps the answer is photon? Because photon is a fundamental particle, not an effective one. Wait, but the question says "effective particles," so maybe the options are quasiparticles. Wait, the wording is: "Which of the following (effective) particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry?" So maybe the options include both fundamental particles and effective (quasi)particles. For example, Higgs (fundamental), pion (effective, as composite), phonon (effective), magnon (effective), photon (fundamental). Then, photon is not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Alternatively, if gluon is an option, same logic. But given that the Higgs is associated with symmetry breaking, pion (chiral symmetry breaking), phonon (translational symmetry breaking), magnon (spin rotational symmetry breaking), photon (unbroken symmetry), so photon would be the answer. Alternatively, if the question includes the Higgs boson, pion, phonon, magnon, and photon, then photon is the correct answer. Since the user hasn't provided the options, but given that this is a common question in physics exams, I think the answer is the photon. But I need to confirm. Wait, in superconductivity, the photon does get a mass via Higgs mechanism, but in the Standard Model, photon remains massless. So in the Standard Model, photon is not associated with symmetry breaking. But in superconductors, the effective photon (the screened electromagnetic field) is associated with symmetry breaking. However, if the question is about fundamental particles, then photon is not associated. Since the question mentions "effective" particles in parentheses, maybe it's referring to quasiparticles. Phonons and magnons are effective particles (quasiparticles) associated with broken symmetry. Pions are also considered as effective (pseudo-Goldstone) bosons. Higgs is a fundamental particle. So if the options are Higgs, pion, phonon, magnon, photon, then photon is the answer. Alternatively, if gluon is an option, same. But given common exam questions, I think the answer is photon. So I'll go with photon.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

The photon is the effective particle not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. Here's the rationale:

1. **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB)** results in massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons (e.g., pions in QCD) or, for gauged symmetries, massive gauge bosons (like W/Z bosons via the Higgs mechanism). The Higgs boson itself emerges as a remnant of SSB.
   
2. **Photon and Gluons**: In the Standard Model, the photon (gauge boson of unbroken U(1) electromagnetism) and gluons (gauge bosons of unbroken SU(3) color symmetry) remain massless because their associated symmetries are **not spontaneously broken**. The photon’s U(1) symmetry survives after electroweak symmetry breaking (SU(2)×U(1) → U(1)), leaving it massless. Gluons, similarly, mediate strong interactions without SSB.

3. **Other Particles**: 
   - W/Z bosons gain mass via the Higgs mechanism (SSB of electroweak symmetry).
   - Pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons from chiral symmetry breaking in QCD.
   - Phonons and magnons are quasiparticles arising from SSB of translational or rotational symmetries in condensed matter systems.

**Conclusion**: The photon’s symmetry (U(1) electromagnetism) remains unbroken, making it the particle not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. 

**Answer**: The photon.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Wait, but remember that the photon is the gauge boson of the U(1) electromagnetic symmetry, which remains unbroken when the electroweak SU(2) x U(1) symmetry breaks to U(1).

Expanding this, in electroweak theory, the Higgs field breaks SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y → U(1)_em. The photon is the gauge boson applying to the unbroken U(1)_em, remaining massless, while the W and Z bosons gain mass. So massless particles (photon, gluon) aren't associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry— since their symmetries are unbroken. However, particles like the Higgs boson, or the pions (in QCD with approximate symmetry breaking), the W and Z bosons (which became massive via symmetry breaking), etc., do.

But wait, gluons also mediate the strong force. The SU(3) color symmetry isn't broken, but confinement occurs. Gluons themselves are massless but can't be observed freely. Maybe this needs nuance. So yes, the gluon's symmetry isn't broken, so they aren't associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking; same with the photon.

If the question presents for example: Higgs boson, Pions, Phonons, Photon vs. W boson, then I would pick photon as they answer.

Alternatively, if one is a Goldstone boson but doesn't have its symmetry broken? Wait, but Goldstone bosons per se are from spontaneous symmetry breaking; for instance, pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons due to the approximate chiral symmetry breaking. A phonon is a Goldstone mode from broken translational symmetry. So all of those would be from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Then, W and Z boson masses come from SSB as well.

Hence, the only particles not associated with SSB would be massless gauge bosons of unbroken symmetry groups. So Photon, gluon, graviton (if that exists as a massless particle). If the server is part of the options, and assuming the standard model settings, the answer would be the photon or gluon. However, since the Higgs is from SSB, and possibly in the options presented as, say, the photon then that's the answer.

Given that the user mentioned "effective" particles, maybe like phonons or something in condensed matter. Alternatively, if they mention conventional particles (like in the Standard Model), then Photon.

Wait, but wait—they said "effective particles", which could refer to quasiparticles like phonons, excitations in a medium. Phonons, for instance, come from breaking of translational symmetry, so in a crystal lattice, which breaks the continuous translational symmetry. However, phonons, as a Goldstone mode, are part of the broken symmetry. Magnons in ferromagnets break rotational symmetry. So perhaps "effective particle" here suggests a collective excitation (quasiparticle) which originates from a broken symmetry.

But then, the question states "effective particles", which may or may not be elementary. For example, pions are considered pseudo-Goldstone bosons, and in some sense effective particles in low-energy QCD. The Higgs is similarly part of the Standard Model's spontaneous symmetry breaking. Then, perhaps there's a particle like the electron, a fermion not arising from symmetry breaking. But the mass of the electron does come from Yukawa coupling to the Higgs, so in a sense connected to SSB.

So again, perhaps the answer is the photon. If in the list, the other options include, say, Higgs, pion, phonon, magnon, and photon, the answer is photon.

So I think, the correct answer is the photon. But we need to imagine perhaps the options.

Alternatively, maybe the proton is presented? But the proton is a composite particle due to QCD, which spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry (producing pions). But the proton itself isn't generated via symmetry breaking; it's a bound state.

Alternatively, if one talks about 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles in certain theories (SU(2) symmetry breaking) but those are not elementary particles. Maybe in Flux tubes or something else. However, the user specifies "particles", not in the sense of solitons.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the neutrino. Wait, in the Standard Model, neutrinos were considered massless, but now they have mass. If, however, the model neglects neutrino masses (right-handed singlets not considered), but their masses could come from another mechanism. So unless the neutrino's mass comes from the Higgs, then it's via SSB, similar to other fermions. However, if massive via another method, such as the seesaw, which might not directly use the same Higgs. Hmm, but even so, I think normally the answer here is going to be photon or gluon.

Since the original prompt is asking which is NOT associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Because Normally, Higgs is connected to SSB, so \phi^4 theory, W and Z get mass, nambu-goldstone bosons have been eaten. Then if someone lists like photon, Higgs, pion, phonon, and, say, electron; the ones not associated maybe is photon (because it’s a gauge boson from unbroken symmetry, electron mass comes from Higgs, so its mass is due to SSB).

Alternatively, some other particle. Maybe the graviton. But who knows.

Wait, the question is "effective particles." If the options are Goldstone bosons, Higgs boson, gauge bosons (massive), and perhaps another option. My initial intuition is that the answer is photon. For example, Nambu-Goldstone bosons (like pions or phonons) come from SSB. Higgs arises when the symmetry breaking is gauged. Massive gauge bosons (like W and Z) do too. The Standard Model photon is part of the unbroken U(1), so not associated.

But if the answer is the photon or maybe an electron, but the electron mass comes from Higgs, so link to SSB. But perhaps the muon, same deal.

Without the given options, but commonly, such questions have the photon as the correct answer. So maybe the answer is the photon. But I need to ensure.

Given the context of effective particles, pions are considered effective particles in low-energy QCD; the Higgs is a fundamental particle in Standard Model (but result of SSB). Massive gauge bosons come from SSB. If photon is kept massless (not part of SSB) then yes. Even in superconductors, effectively photons become massive, but in vacuum, photons are massless. Similarly, the gluon is massless. If gluon is an option, then gluon. But if it's photon. Depends.

Alternatively, maybe a Cooper pair is an effective particle (though a composite) - Cooper pairs condensation leads to superconductivity which breaks symmetry. But Cooper pair itself is a bound state, not a particle associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry.

Overall, based on my reasoning, the likely candidate is the photon or gluon. Since in the Standard Model spontaneous symmetry breaking to the Higgs field gives masses to W, Z, fermions, leaving photon and gluon massless. So, from the list, likely photon or gluon.

However, the question says "effective particles," suggesting quasiparticles? Then, again, phonons, magnons are quasiparticles arising from SSB.

Alternatively, it's traditional particles. Assuming every other option is part of a Broken symmetry except photon, which is massless. Hence, the answer is photon.
