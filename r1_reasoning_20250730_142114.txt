REASONING:
Okay, so I need to figure out what 2 plus 2 is. Let me start by recalling basic addition. When you add two numbers, you're combining their values. So if I have two apples and someone gives me two more apples, how many apples do I have in total?

Hmm, let's count. One, two, and then three, four. That makes four apples. Wait, but is there a more mathematical way to verify this? Maybe using my fingers. Hold up two fingers on one hand and two on the other. When I put them together, I have four fingers up. That seems right.

Another way to think about it is using number lines. Start at 2, then move 2 steps forward. So starting at 0, move to 2, then add 2 more: 3, 4. Yeah, that lands on 4. 

But sometimes I get confused with multiplication. Wait, 2 times 2 is 4, but addition is different. No, in this case, both operations give the same result, but they're different processes. Here, it's definitely addition, so 2 added to 2 is 4. 

Let me check with another example to see if my method works. If 2 + 3 is 5, then adding 2 + 2 should be one less, which is 4. That makes sense. Also, subtracting, if 4 - 2 is 2, then adding them back should give 4. 

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I can remember that 1 + 1 is 2, so 2 + 2 is just two times that, which would be 4. Or since 2 is 1+1, then 2 + 2 is (1+1)+(1+1) which is 4 ones, so 4. 

Yeah, all these methods point to the answer being 4. I can't think of a scenario where 2 + 2 wouldn't equal 4 in basic arithmetic. Maybe in different number systems, but assuming it's standard base 10, it's definitely 4. 

I guess that's it. 2 plus 2 equals 4. Simple, but good to verify.

FINAL ANSWER:
The result of 2 + 2 is **4**. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Start with the number 2.**
2. **Add 2 more units to it.**
3. **Counting the total:** 2 (initial) + 2 (added) = 4.

**Answer:** 4
