This fallacy operates by associating the senator with an institution (elite university) perceived as incompatible with understanding low-income struggles, thereby discrediting his credibility *without addressing his actual work or arguments*. While this could superficially resemble an *ad hominem* (attacking the person), the specific mechanism here aligns with **guilt by association**: the senator\u2019s affiliation with an elite institution is framed as inherently negative and disqualifying, even though no direct evidence is provided to prove his lack of empathy.  \n\nOption **C (straw man)** is incorrect because the argument does not misrepresent Carter\u2019s position\u2014it ignores his actual work and attacks his background instead.

But if the infection does not go away, it can spread to the rest of the person's body. To stop the infection from spreading, the infected limb may need to be amputated.\nIn other cases, when a limb is badly injured, the skin, bones, muscles, and nerves may be severely damaged. If the damaged tissue cannot heal, it may die. The severely damaged or dead tissue then needs to be amputated.\n\nA. After an accident, the limb is too badly injured to heal.\nB.

But how does an organism's body actually get energy out of food?\nSelect the true statement.\n\nHint: Food supplies an organism with many small, energy-rich molecules. These molecules are taken in by the organism's cells. Inside cells, the molecules from food are broken down to release energy that cells can use. This energy powers cell processes that allow the entire organism to grow and live.\n\nA. Breaking down molecules can release energy.\nB. Cells usually take in large food molecules.\n\nPlease select the correct answer and provide detailed reasoning for your choice.",

Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n1. **Contrasting Concepts**:  \n   - *Extremism* vs. *moderation* (opposing approaches)  \n   - *Defense of liberty* vs. *pursuit of justice* (different but related ideals)  \n   - *No vice* vs. *no virtue* (inversion of moral judgments, as \"vice\" and \"virtue\" are direct antonyms).  \n\n2. **Parallel Structure**:  \n   Both clauses follow the same grammatical pattern:  \n   - \"**Noun** (extremism/moderation) + **prepositional phrase** (in the defense/pursuit of...) + **negation of a moral quality** (no vice/no virtue).\"  \n\n3. **Why Not Chiasmus?**  \n   Chiasmus requires a **reversal of structure** (e.g., AB \u2192 BA). For example, in JFK\u2019s \"Ask not what your country can do for you\u2014ask what you can do for your country,\" the order of \"country\" and \"you\" flips. Goldwater\u2019s lines, however, maintain the same *noun + prepositional phrase + negation* sequence without inversion, ruling out chiasmus.  \n\nThe text uses **antithesis** to starkly contrast ideas about ideological extremes, emphasizing moral paradoxes in political action.",
