This increases the carbon count to 10.\n\n3. **Step 2:** Oxidation with PCC converts the primary alcohol back to an aldehyde, maintaining the 10-carbon structure.\n\n4. **Step 3:** The third reaction involves (dimethyl(oxo)-\u03bb6-sulfaneylidene)methane, which typically oxidizes alcohols but doesn't add any carbons. Since product 2 is already an aldehyde, this step likely doesn't alter the carbon count.\n\nThus, product 3 has 10 carbon atoms.\n\n**Answer:** 10 carbon atoms."
