To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex at an ideal pH of 25 °C, we use the given stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \).

1. **Understanding the dissociation**:
   - The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:
     \[
     \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
     \]
   - The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the reciprocal of the formation constant \( K_f \):
     \[
     K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
     \]

2. **Setting up the equilibrium expression**:
   - Let the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) at equilibrium be \( x \). Since the dissociation is 1:1, the concentration of \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) will also be \( x \).
   - The equilibrium concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \) (since \( x \) is very small due to the large \( K_f \)).

3. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - Using the dissociation constant expression:
     \[
     K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}
     \]
     \[
     2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = 2 \times 10^{-11} \times 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
     \]
     \[
     x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7}
     \]

4. **Considering significant figures**:
   - Given that the stability constant \( K_f \) is provided with one significant figure, the result should be rounded to one significant figure.

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in the solution is \(\boxed{6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}\).

Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant (K) for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms strong complexes with metal ions like calcium. The problem mentions a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, so I guess that means the calcium and EDTA are in a 1:1 molar ratio. EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so it binds the metal ion with multiple coordination sites. But maybe here, the exact structure isn't important. 

The stability constant K is given, which I think is the formation constant (Kf) for the complex. The larger the Kf, the more stable the complex is, meaning it's more likely to stay formed rather than dissociate. For very large K values, I might need to make some approximations because the dissociation might be very minimal. 

So the reaction should be: Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ⇌ Ca-EDTA²-. The formation constant Kf is given by [Ca-EDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Since Kf is 5x10^10, which is a very large number, the equilibrium will lie far to the right, meaning most of the Ca²+ and EDTA are bound in the complex. But since the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution of Ca-EDTA, I assume that the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and there are no initial concentrations of free Ca²+ or EDTA⁴-. When the complex dissociates, it will produce some Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- ions.

Let me write the equation again: Initially, [Ca-EDTA²-] = 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the complex will dissociate slightly into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴-. Let’s let the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium be x. Then, since it's a 1:1:1 ratio, the concentrations of both Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- will be x each, and the concentration of the complex will be 0.02 - x. 

But since Kf is very large (5e10), the reverse reaction is more about dissociation here? Wait, no. Kf is the formation constant, so it's for the formation of the complex from the ions. Therefore, the dissociation of the complex would be the reverse reaction, and the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf. 

Right, so if Kf is 5e10, then Kd (the dissociation constant) is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. So the dissociation is very small, so the value of x should be very small compared to 0.02. Therefore, approximation 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. 

Therefore, the expression using Kd would be: Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]/[Ca-EDTA²-]. Since the dissociation produces equal amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴-, their concentrations will both be x. So substituting into Kd:

2e-11 = (x)(x) / (0.02) 

So x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13 

Taking square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Let's see, sqrt(4e-13) is (4e-13)^0.5. Since sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. 6.5 is 6 + 0.5, so 1e-6 is 1e-6, times 1e-0.5 which is approx 0.316. So 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. Multiply by 2 gives 6.32e-7. Wait, that's without using calculator. But actually, 4e-13 when square rooted is 2e-6.5, but 0.5 in exponent is same as sqrt(10) in denominator. Because 10^(0.5) is sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16. So 10^-6.5 is 1/(10^6 * sqrt(10)) ≈ 1/(1e6 * 3.16) ≈ 3.16e-7. Then 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. But maybe I needn't approximate. Let me compute sqrt(4e-13) numerically.

4e-13 = 4 * 10^-13. The square root of 4 is 2, square root of 10^-13 is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5. So 10^-6.5 is the same as 1/(10^6.5) ≈ 3.1623e-7. So 2*3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.3245e-7. Therefore x ≈6.32e-7 M. Therefore, the concentration of Ca²+ ions is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, but shouldn't this be exact?

Alternatively, exact value:

x = sqrt(Kd * 0.02) = sqrt( (2e-11) * 0.02 )

Wait, Kd was calculated as 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Then [Ca²+] = sqrt( (2e-11) * 0.02 )

(2e-11)*(0.02) = 4e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. As above.

But 2e-6.5 is equal to 2/(10^6.5) = 2/(10^6 * sqrt(10)) = 2/(3162277.66) ≈ 6.3245e-7. Therefore, approximately 6.32e-7 M. Which is 6.3 x10^-7 M.

But perhaps the answer expects a more symbolic expression. Let me check without substituting numbers into scientific notation.

If Kd is 1/(5e10) and the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then x = sqrt(Kd * [Ca-EDTA])

So x = sqrt( (1/(5e10)) * 0.02 )

Multiply 1/(5e10) by 0.02: 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

Then x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 which we converted to 6.32e-7. So, yes, solid.

But since the question specifies stoichiometric Ca-EDTA, so presumably all the EDTA is in the complex form. So as per the calculation, free Ca²+ is 6.3e-7.

But maybe we can write it squared in terms of Kd and then present it. Let me see if that's necessary.

Alternatively, do I need to account for any other factors? The pH is ideal. EDTA's ability to complex with metals depends on pH because the protonation state of EDTA affects its ability to coordinate with metal ions. The problem states the pH is ideal, which I think refers to it being sufficiently high that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y^4-). Since the deprotonated form is needed for the complexation. If the pH isn't high enough, not all the EDTA would be available to bind Ca²+, but here since pH is ideal, we don't have to consider that. So the K value given is under those ideal pH conditions, so we don't need to adjust it for protonation.

Therefore, my previous calculation holds. Unless there's something I'm missing. Let me think again.

Stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex probably implies they are in a 1:1 ratio, so 0.02 M of both Ca and EDTA complexed. However, when they dissociate, the total EDTA (complex + free) would be 0.02 M. Wait a second, is the total EDTA concentration (free + complex) 0.02 M, or is [Ca-EDTA] 0.02 M?

The problem states "solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex". So I think that means the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. So as when the complex falls apart, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- in a 1:1 ratio, and the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So when setting up the equilibrium, the starting point is [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = 0, [EDTA⁴-] = 0. The problem is units.

Yes, because in solution, you initially have only the complex. It will dissociate a little to form some Ca²+ and EDTA⁴-.

Thus, using the Kd (dissociation constant), which is 1/Kf. So Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]/[Ca-EDTA²-] = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) ≈ x²/0.02 = 2e-11.

Hence x²= 2e-11 *0.02 = 4e-13 → x= ~2e-6.5 ≈6.32e-7 M.

Therefore, the concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M, that is, 6.3 x10^-7 M. To write as 6.3 x10^-7 M. However, perhaps I need to present two significant figures. Because the given Kf is one significant figure (5x10^10) but wait, 5x10^10 is one significant figure. However, the concentration is 0.02 M which is two significant figures.

Therefore, in general, the answer is sqrt( (0.02)/ (5x10^10) ), but wait, recall that if Kd is (1/Kf), so:

[Ca²+] = sqrt( Kd * [Ca-EDTA] ) = sqrt( [Ca-EDTA] / Kf )

Wait, yes: Kd = 1/Kf. Therefore, [Ca²+]² = (Kd)([Ca-EDTA])

Yes, [Ca²+] = sqrt( (1/Kf) * [Ca-EDTA] )

So plugging in the numbers, [Ca²+] = sqrt( (0.02) / (5e10) )

Compute 0.02 /5e10 = (2e-2)/5e10 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

Then square root is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = as before.

But with significant figures. The given values are 0.02 M (two sig figs) and 5x10^10 (one sig fig. So the answer should have one significant figure. Wait, usually, in multiplication/division, the number with the least number of sig figs determines the result. But in the calculation here, we multiply 0.02 (two sig figs) by 1/(5x10^10) (one sig fig). So total number of sig figs is one. Hence, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. Alternatively, if taking account that Kf is given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), and the concentration is 0.02 (two?), perhaps confliting, but conservatively, since the leading value with the least sig fig is Kf (1 sig fig), so the answer should have one. Therefore, 6e-7 M.

But maybe not some. Since 0.02 has two, Kf has one, but when we combine them in a square root, how are sig figs treated? When multiplying and dividing, significant figures are determined by the least. Here [Ca-EDTA]/Kf: 0.02 /5e10 is 4e-13. 0.02= 2e-2, divided by 5e10 gives (2/5)e-12= 4e-13. 0.02 has two sig figs, Kf maybe is considered one. Then when taking the square root of (4e-13), the number of significant figures: some sources say for roots, the number of sig figs in the root is the same as the number in the original. So 4e-13 has one sig fig (from Kf), then the square root will also have one sig fig? So the answer would be 6e-7 (one sig fig). Or, if the 0.02 is considered, then maybe two? However, often constants like Kf given as 5x10^10 may be considered as accurate, so maybe the value of Kf is more precise but written as a single sig fig. If we take Kf as exact, such as in the problem they gave, but in exams, sometimes constants are treated as exact, but in this case, it's written one sig fig which might be intentional.

But probably, since Kf is written as 5x10^10, one sig fig, so even if 0.02 is two, the result should round to one sig fig. So x = 6e-7 M. So the answer is 6x10^-7 M.

Wait, but let's see. Let me recompute with exact numbers:

Let me compute sqrt(4e-13):

In decimal terms, 4e-13 is 0.0000000000004, so very small. The square root would be sqrt(0.0000000000004) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * sqrt(1e-13) = 2*(1e-6.5). The square root of 10^-13 is 10^-6.5. 

10^-6.5 can be written as 1/(10^6.5), which is approximately 1 / 3162277.66, so approximately 3.1623e-7, so 2*3.1623e-7=6.3245e-7.

So approximately 6.32e-7. If using one sig fig, it is 6e-7. If possible, they might expect answer in two sig figs because concentration was 0.02 (even though Kf is one). But perhaps in this case, 6.3 x10^-7 (if two sig figs) or 6x10^-7 (one).

Alternatively, maybe the answer is written as 2×10^−6.5 or expressed exactly as sqrt(0.02/(5×10^10)), but in terms of a numerical value, probably rounded to 6.3e-7.

Wait, but since maybe isn't PhD-level, is this user's problem a high school/ first year undergrad question? Probably.

Given that, and in textbooks if for example:

The answer is  the square root of (0.02 / (5e10)), which is sqrt(4e-13) ≈ 6.3e-7 M which is 6.3 x10^-7 M. So if given in those terms, but, given that we have Kf given as 5e^10 (1 sig), would that take precedence? How approximate?

Alternatively, sometimes in chemistry, if values are given with different sig figs, and if Kf is given as one significant figure, we go with that. So answer 6e-7 M.

However, maybe sometimes they can accept two digits if they take 0.02 (2 s.f.). If both values' number of significant figures affect the result, which one takes precedence. Wait, the expression is sqrt([Complex]/(Kf)). [Complex] is two sig fig, Kf is one. The division would be (((0.02)/(5x10^10))—so division, 0.02 divided by 5e10. 0.02 has two, 5e10 has one. The result is 4e-13, ( with one sig. fig., since the divisor is one). Then the square root is considered sqrt(4e-13). Since the sig. figs. in intermediate steps: after dividing, it is one sig. Therefore, final answer should be one sig. Thus, 6e-7. Which is 6 x10^-7 M.

Hence, the answer is 6×10⁻⁷ M.

Wait.

Alternatively, if you consider KCa-EDTA as 5.0x10^10, that would be two sig figs, but if written as 5x10^10, that's one. In the problem statement, it is written as 5x10^10. Therefore, definite one. So probably, the answer is 6e-7.

Alternatively, is the answer different? Wait, maybe I made an assumption that the EDTA is all dissociated, but perhaps not. But EDTA is hexaprotic, but at ideal pH (presumably 10-12), the EDTA is fully deprotonated.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is as follows.

But let me verify another way: if [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M, Kf = 5e10 = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). Assuming EDTA and Calcium are the only species, and EDTA and calcium have been complexed. At equilibrium, [Ca] = [EDTA] = x (because they're generated in a 1:1 ratio), therefore:

Kf= (0.02 - x)/(x^2). Since x is presumably very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then:

Kf ≈ 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13. X= 2e-6.5, as above.

Therefore, same calculation. So seems correct. So unless some other factor, my answer is correct. Therefore, the concentration is 6.3e-7 M. Rounded to 6e-7.

In the problem, if acceptable, user can write 6.3 x10^-7, but given Kf is 1 s.f., perhaps 6e-7.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant (K) for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Therefore, the dissociation of the complex would be the reverse reaction, and the dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf. 

Right, so if Kf is 5e10, then Kd (the dissociation constant) is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. So the dissociation is very small, so the value of x should be very small compared to 0.02. Therefore, approximation 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. 

Therefore, the expression using Kd would be: Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]/[Ca-EDTA²-]. Since the dissociation produces equal amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴-, their concentrations will both be x. So substituting into Kd:

2e-11 = (x)(x) / (0.02) 

So x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13 

Taking square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Let's see, sqrt(4e-13) is (4e-13)^0.5. Since sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. 6.5 is 6 + 0.5, so 1e-6 is 1e-6, times 1e-0.5 which is approx 0.316. So 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. Multiply by 2 gives 6.32e-7. Wait, that's without using calculator. But actually, 4e-13 when square rooted is 2e-6.5, but 0.5 in exponent is same as sqrt(10) in denominator. Because 10^(0.5) is sqrt(1

# Anthropic completion

I'm currently working on a problem about determining the calcium ion concentration in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The solution is at an ideal pH and 25°C temperature. The stability constant (K) for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10.

I recall that EDTA functions as a chelating agent that creates strong complexes with metal ions such as calcium. Since the problem mentions a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, I believe this indicates a 1:1 molar ratio between calcium and EDTA. Although EDTA is a hexadentate ligand that binds metal ions through multiple coordination sites, the specific structure may not be crucial for solving this problem.

The provided stability constant K is likely the formation constant (Kf) for the complex. A higher Kf value indicates a more stable complex that's less prone to dissociation. With very large K values, I might need to use approximations since dissociation would be minimal.

The reaction can be represented as: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻. The formation constant Kf equals [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]). With Kf being 5x10^10, which is quite large, the equilibrium strongly favors the complex formation. I assume the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, with no free Ca²⁺ or EDTA⁴⁻ initially present. Some Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ ions will be produced when the complex dissociates.

To summarize: Initially, [Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 M. At equilibrium, some dissociation occurs. If I let the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ be x, then due to the 1:1:1 ratio, [EDTA⁴⁻] will also be x, and [Ca-EDTA²⁻] will be 0.02 - x.

Since Kf is very large, I need to consider the dissociation constant Kd, which equals 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5x10^10) = 2x10^-11. This small value indicates minimal dissociation, so x should be very small compared to 0.02, allowing me to approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Using Kd: Kd = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA²⁻]
Substituting: 2x10^-11 = (x)(x)/(0.02)
So x² = 2x10^-11 × 0.02 = 4x10^-13

Taking the square root: x = √(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5
Calculating √(4x10^-13): Since √4 = 2 and √(10^-13) = 10^-6.5, the result is 2x10^-6.5.
10^-6.5 equals 10^-6 × 10^-0.5, which is approximately 10^-6 × 0.316, giving 3.16x10^-7.
Multiplying by 2 gives 6.32x10^-7.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, so I've got a situation here where I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The conditions are optimal with a pH like a textbook laboratory scenario, and the temperature is a steady 25°C. The stability constant (K) for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. Let me break down how to tackle this.

First off, I remember EDTA is a strong chelating agent that forms stable complexes with metal ions, such as calcium. Since the problem specifies a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, that implies a 1:1 molar ratio between calcium and EDTA. EDTA is known as a hexadentate ligand, meaning it attaches to the metal ion at multiple points; however, the detailed structure might not be crucial here.

We have the stability constant, which indicates the formation constant (Kf) for the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex tends to be, indicating it prefers to remain intact rather than dissociate. For substantial Kf values, approximations may be required due to very limited dissociation.

The reaction should look like this: Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ⇌ Ca-EDTA²-. The formation constant Kf is determined by the ratio [Ca-EDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Given Kf is 5x10^10, a notably large value, the equilibrium is heavily shifted to the right, suggesting most Ca²+ and EDTA are bound as a complex. With it being a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA solution, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, starting with no free Ca²+ or EDTA⁴-. Upon dissociation, it will release some Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- ions.

Considering the equation again: initially [Ca-EDTA²-] = 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the complex slightly dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴-. We'll denote the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium as x. Because it's a 1:1:1 reaction, both Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- will have a concentration of x, and the complex will be at 0.02 - x.

However, given that Kf is extremely large (5e10), dissociation is minimal. Actually, since Kf is the formation constant, the dissociation constant Kd would be its inverse, meaning Kd = 1/Kf.

So, with Kf at 5e10, Kd (the dissociation constant) translates to 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. This indicates very limited dissociation, so x is tiny compared to 0.02. Hence, we approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Thus, applying Kd: Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]/[Ca-EDTA²-]. With equal dissociation into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴-, their values are x: 

2e-11 = (x)(x) / (0.02)

Now, solving for x: x² = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13

Taking the square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. After calculations without a calculator, you find sqrt(4e-13) leads to (4e-13)^0.5, and since sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) ends at 1e-6.5. 6.5 is broken down as 6 + 0.5, making sqrt(10^0.5) roughly 0.316, thus 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. Multiply by 2 yields 6.32e-7. But, yes, 4e-13, after square rooting, is 2e-6.5; note that 0.5 in the exponent equals sqrt(10) in the denominator since 10^(0.5) equates to sqrt(1).

The equilibrium concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is approximately 0.02 M (since \\( x \\) is very small).\n\nUsing the dissociation constant expression:\n\\[ K_d = \\frac{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]} \\]\n\\[ 2 \\times 10^{-11} = \\frac{x^2}{0.02} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x^2 = 2 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 0.02 \\]\n\\[ x^2 = 4 \\times 10^{-13} \\]\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} \\]\n\\[ x = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\]\n\\[ x \\approx 6.32 \\times 10^{-7} \\]\n\nConsidering significant figures, the given formation constant \\( K_f = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\) has one significant figure, and the concentration 0.02 M has two significant figures. However, the final answer is typically expressed with two significant figures based on the concentration given.\n\nThus, the concentration of calcium ions is:\n\\[ \\boxed{6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}} \\]', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning='e1), so 1e-6.5 is 1e-6 / sqrt(10) ≈ 1e-6 / 3.16 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7. \n\nBut maybe I should compute it precisely.  Let\'s compute 4e-13. The square root is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Well, 1e-6.5 is equal to 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = (1e-6) * (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-7. Multiply by 2: 6.324e-7. \n\nSo x ≈ 6.324e-7 M. Therefore, the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.32e-7 M. But let me check if the approximation is valid. The value of x is 6.32e-7, and the initial concentration was 0.02, so 6.32e-7 is much smaller than 0.02, which is 2e-2. 6.32e-7 is indeed negligible compared to 0.02, so the approximation holds. \n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider not making the approximation. Then, Kd = x²/(0.02 - x). Substitute that as Kd = 2e-11. Then, set up the equation x² + (2e-11)x - 0.02*2e-11 = 0. So:\n\nx² + 2e-11 x - 4e-13 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: x = [-2e-11 ± sqrt((2e-11)^2 + 16e-13)] / 2. Let\'s compute the discriminant first:\n\n(2e-11)^2 = 4e-22.\n\n16e-13 is 1.6e-12. Adding them together gives 4e-22 + 1.6e-12 ≈ 1.6e-12 (since 4e-22 is negligible). So sqrt(1.6e-12) ≈ 1.2649e-6. Therefore:\n\nx = [-2e-11 ± 1.2649e-6]/2. We discard the negative root because concentration can\'t be negative. So x ≈ (1.2649e-6 - 2e-11)/2 ≈ (1.2649e-6)/2 ≈ 6.3245e-7, which is essentially the same as our previous approximation. So the difference caused by the x term in the denominator is negligible, so our initial approximation was valid. Therefore, [Ca²+] ≈ 6.32e-7 M.\n\nBut wait, given Kd was based on reactions where EDTA⁴- is the species involved. But in solution, EDTA exists in different protonation states depending on pH. The problem states "pH is ideal", which I assume means that the pH is adjusted such that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, i.e., Y⁴- (EDTA⁴-), which is the form that binds to Ca²+. This is important because the formation constant Kf is typically given for the reaction with Y⁴-. So, at ideal pH (probably around 10 or so, where EDTA is mostly deprotonated), the concentration of EDTA⁴- will be equal to the concentration of free EDTA. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is valid because we don\'t have to consider protonation states—everything is in the form needed for the complex. So our calculation should hold. \n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M.\n\nBut let me confirm once again. The problem says "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex". Hmm, stoichiometric might mean equimolar, but since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, which is already a 1:1 complex. So if it\'s stoichiometric, maybe there is no excess of either Ca²+ or EDTA. So, if they are in stoichiometric amounts, so when dissolved, they form the complex, but only the complex. So when dissociation happens, small amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- are formed.\n\nTherefore, our calculation is still correct. The answer is 6.3e-7 M. Wait, my calculation gave 6.32e-7, but given the K value is 5e10, which is 5.0 x10^10. Let me recompute precisely.\n\nWait, Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5e10) = 2e-11. The previous Kd was correct. Then setting up the equation x² = Kd * [Ca-EDTA²-]. So, with [Ca-EDTA²-] = 0.02, Kd = 2e-11:\n\nx² = (2e-11)(0.02) = 4e-13.\n\nThen, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 x 10^(-6.5). Calculating 10^(-6.5):\n\nFirst, 10^0.5 is approximately 3.1623, so 10^(-0.5) = 1/3.1623 ≈ 0.31623. Therefore, 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) x 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-6 x 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-7. Multiply by 2: 6.3245e-7. So, x ≈ 6.3245e-7. Rounded to two significant figures, since 0.02 has one significant figure? Wait, here 0.02 M is two significant figures. The K is given as 5x10^10, which is one significant figure? 5x10^10 is one, but maybe 5.0x10^10 would be two. The problem states 5x10^10, so perhaps one significant figure. But let\'s check. Depending on the source, sometimes in problems like this, the K values might be considered exact, but in the absence of specific information, perhaps the K is given as one significant figure, the concentration as two. Then when multiplying 0.02 (two) and 5e10 (one), the answer would have one significant figure. Wait, but actually, in our case, the key calculation is sqrt(4e-13). Let me think: 0.02 is two sig figs, K is one. So Kd is 2e-11 (one sig fig). Then x^2 = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13. So 4e-13 has one sig fig. Then sqrt(4e-13) is 6e-7. Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13, which is one significant figure? Wait, if K was given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), then Kd is 2e-11 (one sig fig). 0.02 is two. When multiplying 2e-11 * 0.02, the result is 4e-13, which would have one sig fig (since 2e-11 has one), so the answer would be 4e-13, and sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is around 6.3e-7. But with uncertainties, if Kd is one sig fig, then sqrt(2e-11 * 0.02) is sqrt(4e-13) ≈ 6e-7 with one sig fig.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the problem gives K as 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, and 0.02 M is two. However, in practical terms, when combining values with different sig figs, the result is given by the least number of sig figs. But I need to check. Let me recall that.\n\nIn multiplication/division, the number of sig figs is based on the least number of sig figs in the input. So, Kd is 1/(5x10^10) = 2x10^-11 (1 sig fig). The concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 (two sig figs). So when Kd * [Ca-EDTA] = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13 (1 sig fig). Then when taking a square root, which is a power of 0.5, the number of sig figs stays the same. So square root of 4e-13 (1 sig fig) is 6e-7 (1 sig fig). So perhaps the answer should be reported as 6e-7 M.\n\nWait, but 4e-13 has one sig fig. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5 which is approximately 6e-7. If 4e-13 is considered one significant figure, then the square root would also have one sig fig, so 6e-7. But let me think again. Maybe more precise:\n\nsqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5 ≈ 2 * 3.162e-7 ≈ 6.324e-7. But with one sig fig, this is 6e-7. But maybe since the concentration is 0.02 with two sig figs, perhaps the answer is 6.3e-7. Wait, but the K value is a critical part here. Hmmm.\n\nI think the safest approach here is to carry through the error. The Kf is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig). Then Kd is 2x10^-11 (1 sig fig). Then, multiplication by 0.02 M (two sig figs): 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13 (still 1 sig fig because Kd is one sig fig). So square root of 4e-13 is 6.3e-7, which would be reported as 6e-7 with one sig fig. But wait, the sqrt(4e-13) is not exactly a multiplication, it\'s a different operation. Hmm. Let\'s recall the rules again. \n\nWhen a number is written in scientific notation, the number of significant figures is the number of digits in the coefficient. So 4e-13 has one sig fig (just the 4). Therefore, sqrt(4e-13) should also be expressed with one sig fig. Therefore, sqrt(4e-13) is 6e-7 (since 6.3e-7 would have two sig figs). Therefore, the answer should be 6e-7 M, with one significant figure. Wait, but 4 is just 1 sig fig, and the square root of that would be 2 (1 sig fig) * 1e-6.5. But 3.16e-7 is approximately two sig figs. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think differently.\n\nIf I have x^2 = 4e-13, then x = sqrt(4e-13). Since 4e-13 has one significant figure, then x is 6e-7, because that is one significant figure. 6.3e-7 would be two significant figures. Therefore, to adhere to significant figure rules, we\'d have to write 6e-7. Alternatively, if the problem allows for a more precise answer despite the Kf being given with one sig fig, but since the problem didn\'t specify, maybe in the context of such problems, we can write it with two sig figs, since the concentration was given as 0.02 (two). But actually, the multiplication involves 0.02 (two sig figs) and 2e-11 (one sig figs). The product is 4e-13. The rule for multiplication is that the result should have the same number of sig figs as the factor with the least number. 2e-11 has one, 0.02 has two. So the product has one. Then the square root of that (4e-13) is approximated with one sig fig, resulting in 6e-7. \n\nBut I think many sources might present the answer as 6.3e-7 regardless, because the calculation gives a clear numerical answer. But perhaps in an exam setting, with the given significant figures, they might expect 6e-7. Alternatively, it might be considered that the given values, although Kf is 5e10 (1 sig fig), but perhaps the problem expects the answer to use all given digits. Because sometimes, in problems like these, unless specified otherwise, we just use the numbers given. But the problem states KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. So maybe it\'s written as 5.0x10^10. Wait, no, the user wrote 5x10^10. If it\'s written as 5x10^10, that\'s one sig fig, if it\'s 5.0x10^10, that\'s two. Since it\'s written as 5x10^10, then it is one. Therefore, following the sig figs, the answer would be 6e-7 M. But I think in the context of the problem, it might be expecting an answer of 6.3e-7, and the exact answer. But perhaps the user would need to specify. Wait, looking at the question again:\n\n"What is the concentration of calcium ions...?" The answer requires the concentration given 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, pH is ideal, K=5e10. So they expect the exact value. Probably, they expect it to be calculated as sqrt( (0.02 / 5e10) )? Wait, wait hang on.\n\nWait, earlier we thought of Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) = 5e10. But since the complex dissociates into Ca and EDTA in 1:1 ratio, then at equilibrium, [Ca] = [EDTA] = x. Then, the expression is Kf = (0.02 - x)/(x^2). But since x is small, 0.02 - x ~ 0.02. Thus, 5e10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2. Therefore, solving for x^2: x^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = 4e-13 / 10, wait, wait. Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. Then x^2 = (0.02 / 5e10) = (2e-2 / 5e10) = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Wait, that\'s same as before! Then x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7. So regardless, the answer is still 6.32e-7. \n\nSo maybe it\'s acceptable to give 6.3e-7 M as the answer, even if Kf was given with one significant figure. Depending on the convention in the text or the course. Alternatively, 6 x 10^-7 M to one significant figure. Let me think again: in calculations, significant figures matter, but sometimes the problem might want the exact answer regardless. Since the problem is a calculation question, more than a significant figure question, perhaps they want the answer 6.3e-7 M, so around 6.3 x 10^-7 M. That\'s strict calculation. But in terms of significant figures, given the K is one sig fig, I would present one. But the user hasn\'t specified, so perhaps giving the answer to two sig figs (since 0.02 is two), so 6.3 x10^-7.\n\nBut let me check if Kf here can be considered as an exact value. For example, sometimes in textbooks, formation constants are given to a reasonable number of sig figs but treated as exact for the problem. So the 5x10^10 might be a hypothetical exact value for the problem\'s sake, in which case, the answer can have as many sig figs as the concentration allows, which is two (from 0.02 M). Therefore, 6.3e-7 would be two sig figs, 6.3 x10^-7. So perhaps that\'s expected. Hence, writing 6.3 x10^-7 M.\n\nWait, but if Kf is considered exact, the answer is exactly sqrt( (0.02) / (5e10) ) = sqrt( (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = sqrt( (2/5) * 1e-12 ) = sqrt(0.4 * 1e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) as before. Anyway, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 6.324e-7. So 6.32e-7 would be three sig figs, but 0.02 is two. So 6.3e-7 is correct with two sig figs.\n\nSo summarizing all this, the answer is 6.3 x 10^-7 M. But to check one more time, perhaps I made a mistake with the stability constant. Let me recall that log Kf for Ca-EDTA is actually around 10.7, which would make Kf around 5x10^10. Which aligns with the problem\'s given K. So assuming everything is correct, so then the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, finally, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe concentration of calcium ions is \\boxed{6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744975713, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4397, prompt_tokens=1007, total_tokens=5404, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start by noting the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the reciprocal of \( K_f \), which is \( K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = 2 \times 10^{-11} \).

The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:
\[ \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \]

Let the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) at equilibrium be \( x \). Since the dissociation produces equal amounts of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \), their concentrations will both be \( x \). The equilibrium concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is approximately 0.02 M (since \( x \) is very small).

Using the dissociation constant expression:
\[ K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]} \]
\[ 2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x^2 = 2 \times 10^{-11} \times 0.02 \]
\[ x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13} \]
\[ x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} \]
\[ x = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \]
\[ x \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \]

Considering significant figures, the given formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \) has one significant figure, and the concentration 0.02 M has two significant figures. However, the final answer is typically expressed with two significant figures based on the concentration given.

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is:
\[ \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}} \]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

e1), so 1e-6.5 is 1e-6 / sqrt(10) ≈ 1e-6 / 3.16 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7. 

But maybe I should compute it precisely.  Let's compute 4e-13. The square root is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Well, 1e-6.5 is equal to 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = (1e-6) * (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-7. Multiply by 2: 6.324e-7. 

So x ≈ 6.324e-7 M. Therefore, the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.32e-7 M. But let me check if the approximation is valid. The value of x is 6.32e-7, and the initial concentration was 0.02, so 6.32e-7 is much smaller than 0.02, which is 2e-2. 6.32e-7 is indeed negligible compared to 0.02, so the approximation holds. 

Alternatively, let's consider not making the approximation. Then, Kd = x²/(0.02 - x). Substitute that as Kd = 2e-11. Then, set up the equation x² + (2e-11)x - 0.02*2e-11 = 0. So:

x² + 2e-11 x - 4e-13 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-2e-11 ± sqrt((2e-11)^2 + 16e-13)] / 2. Let's compute the discriminant first:

(2e-11)^2 = 4e-22.

16e-13 is 1.6e-12. Adding them together gives 4e-22 + 1.6e-12 ≈ 1.6e-12 (since 4e-22 is negligible). So sqrt(1.6e-12) ≈ 1.2649e-6. Therefore:

x = [-2e-11 ± 1.2649e-6]/2. We discard the negative root because concentration can't be negative. So x ≈ (1.2649e-6 - 2e-11)/2 ≈ (1.2649e-6)/2 ≈ 6.3245e-7, which is essentially the same as our previous approximation. So the difference caused by the x term in the denominator is negligible, so our initial approximation was valid. Therefore, [Ca²+] ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

But wait, given Kd was based on reactions where EDTA⁴- is the species involved. But in solution, EDTA exists in different protonation states depending on pH. The problem states "pH is ideal", which I assume means that the pH is adjusted such that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, i.e., Y⁴- (EDTA⁴-), which is the form that binds to Ca²+. This is important because the formation constant Kf is typically given for the reaction with Y⁴-. So, at ideal pH (probably around 10 or so, where EDTA is mostly deprotonated), the concentration of EDTA⁴- will be equal to the concentration of free EDTA. 

Therefore, the calculation is valid because we don't have to consider protonation states—everything is in the form needed for the complex. So our calculation should hold. 

Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M.

But let me confirm once again. The problem says "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex". Hmm, stoichiometric might mean equimolar, but since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, which is already a 1:1 complex. So if it's stoichiometric, maybe there is no excess of either Ca²+ or EDTA. So, if they are in stoichiometric amounts, so when dissolved, they form the complex, but only the complex. So when dissociation happens, small amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- are formed.

Therefore, our calculation is still correct. The answer is 6.3e-7 M. Wait, my calculation gave 6.32e-7, but given the K value is 5e10, which is 5.0 x10^10. Let me recompute precisely.

Wait, Kd = 1 / Kf = 1 / (5e10) = 2e-11. The previous Kd was correct. Then setting up the equation x² = Kd * [Ca-EDTA²-]. So, with [Ca-EDTA²-] = 0.02, Kd = 2e-11:

x² = (2e-11)(0.02) = 4e-13.

Then, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 x 10^(-6.5). Calculating 10^(-6.5):

First, 10^0.5 is approximately 3.1623, so 10^(-0.5) = 1/3.1623 ≈ 0.31623. Therefore, 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) x 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-6 x 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-7. Multiply by 2: 6.3245e-7. So, x ≈ 6.3245e-7. Rounded to two significant figures, since 0.02 has one significant figure? Wait, here 0.02 M is two significant figures. The K is given as 5x10^10, which is one significant figure? 5x10^10 is one, but maybe 5.0x10^10 would be two. The problem states 5x10^10, so perhaps one significant figure. But let's check. Depending on the source, sometimes in problems like this, the K values might be considered exact, but in the absence of specific information, perhaps the K is given as one significant figure, the concentration as two. Then when multiplying 0.02 (two) and 5e10 (one), the answer would have one significant figure. Wait, but actually, in our case, the key calculation is sqrt(4e-13). Let me think: 0.02 is two sig figs, K is one. So Kd is 2e-11 (one sig fig). Then x^2 = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13. So 4e-13 has one sig fig. Then sqrt(4e-13) is 6e-7. Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13, which is one significant figure? Wait, if K was given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), then Kd is 2e-11 (one sig fig). 0.02 is two. When multiplying 2e-11 * 0.02, the result is 4e-13, which would have one sig fig (since 2e-11 has one), so the answer would be 4e-13, and sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is around 6.3e-7. But with uncertainties, if Kd is one sig fig, then sqrt(2e-11 * 0.02) is sqrt(4e-13) ≈ 6e-7 with one sig fig.

Alternatively, another approach: the problem gives K as 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, and 0.02 M is two. However, in practical terms, when combining values with different sig figs, the result is given by the least number of sig figs. But I need to check. Let me recall that.

In multiplication/division, the number of sig figs is based on the least number of sig figs in the input. So, Kd is 1/(5x10^10) = 2x10^-11 (1 sig fig). The concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 (two sig figs). So when Kd * [Ca-EDTA] = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13 (1 sig fig). Then when taking a square root, which is a power of 0.5, the number of sig figs stays the same. So square root of 4e-13 (1 sig fig) is 6e-7 (1 sig fig). So perhaps the answer should be reported as 6e-7 M.

Wait, but 4e-13 has one sig fig. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5 which is approximately 6e-7. If 4e-13 is considered one significant figure, then the square root would also have one sig fig, so 6e-7. But let me think again. Maybe more precise:

sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5 ≈ 2 * 3.162e-7 ≈ 6.324e-7. But with one sig fig, this is 6e-7. But maybe since the concentration is 0.02 with two sig figs, perhaps the answer is 6.3e-7. Wait, but the K value is a critical part here. Hmmm.

I think the safest approach here is to carry through the error. The Kf is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig). Then Kd is 2x10^-11 (1 sig fig). Then, multiplication by 0.02 M (two sig figs): 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13 (still 1 sig fig because Kd is one sig fig). So square root of 4e-13 is 6.3e-7, which would be reported as 6e-7 with one sig fig. But wait, the sqrt(4e-13) is not exactly a multiplication, it's a different operation. Hmm. Let's recall the rules again. 

When a number is written in scientific notation, the number of significant figures is the number of digits in the coefficient. So 4e-13 has one sig fig (just the 4). Therefore, sqrt(4e-13) should also be expressed with one sig fig. Therefore, sqrt(4e-13) is 6e-7 (since 6.3e-7 would have two sig figs). Therefore, the answer should be 6e-7 M, with one significant figure. Wait, but 4 is just 1 sig fig, and the square root of that would be 2 (1 sig fig) * 1e-6.5. But 3.16e-7 is approximately two sig figs. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think differently.

If I have x^2 = 4e-13, then x = sqrt(4e-13). Since 4e-13 has one significant figure, then x is 6e-7, because that is one significant figure. 6.3e-7 would be two significant figures. Therefore, to adhere to significant figure rules, we'd have to write 6e-7. Alternatively, if the problem allows for a more precise answer despite the Kf being given with one sig fig, but since the problem didn't specify, maybe in the context of such problems, we can write it with two sig figs, since the concentration was given as 0.02 (two). But actually, the multiplication involves 0.02 (two sig figs) and 2e-11 (one sig figs). The product is 4e-13. The rule for multiplication is that the result should have the same number of sig figs as the factor with the least number. 2e-11 has one, 0.02 has two. So the product has one. Then the square root of that (4e-13) is approximated with one sig fig, resulting in 6e-7. 

But I think many sources might present the answer as 6.3e-7 regardless, because the calculation gives a clear numerical answer. But perhaps in an exam setting, with the given significant figures, they might expect 6e-7. Alternatively, it might be considered that the given values, although Kf is 5e10 (1 sig fig), but perhaps the problem expects the answer to use all given digits. Because sometimes, in problems like these, unless specified otherwise, we just use the numbers given. But the problem states KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. So maybe it's written as 5.0x10^10. Wait, no, the user wrote 5x10^10. If it's written as 5x10^10, that's one sig fig, if it's 5.0x10^10, that's two. Since it's written as 5x10^10, then it is one. Therefore, following the sig figs, the answer would be 6e-7 M. But I think in the context of the problem, it might be expecting an answer of 6.3e-7, and the exact answer. But perhaps the user would need to specify. Wait, looking at the question again:

"What is the concentration of calcium ions...?" The answer requires the concentration given 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, pH is ideal, K=5e10. So they expect the exact value. Probably, they expect it to be calculated as sqrt( (0.02 / 5e10) )? Wait, wait hang on.

Wait, earlier we thought of Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) = 5e10. But since the complex dissociates into Ca and EDTA in 1:1 ratio, then at equilibrium, [Ca] = [EDTA] = x. Then, the expression is Kf = (0.02 - x)/(x^2). But since x is small, 0.02 - x ~ 0.02. Thus, 5e10 ≈ 0.02 / x^2. Therefore, solving for x^2: x^2 ≈ 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = 4e-13 / 10, wait, wait. Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. Then x^2 = (0.02 / 5e10) = (2e-2 / 5e10) = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Wait, that's same as before! Then x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7. So regardless, the answer is still 6.32e-7. 

So maybe it's acceptable to give 6.3e-7 M as the answer, even if Kf was given with one significant figure. Depending on the convention in the text or the course. Alternatively, 6 x 10^-7 M to one significant figure. Let me think again: in calculations, significant figures matter, but sometimes the problem might want the exact answer regardless. Since the problem is a calculation question, more than a significant figure question, perhaps they want the answer 6.3e-7 M, so around 6.3 x 10^-7 M. That's strict calculation. But in terms of significant figures, given the K is one sig fig, I would present one. But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps giving the answer to two sig figs (since 0.02 is two), so 6.3 x10^-7.

But let me check if Kf here can be considered as an exact value. For example, sometimes in textbooks, formation constants are given to a reasonable number of sig figs but treated as exact for the problem. So the 5x10^10 might be a hypothetical exact value for the problem's sake, in which case, the answer can have as many sig figs as the concentration allows, which is two (from 0.02 M). Therefore, 6.3e-7 would be two sig figs, 6.3 x10^-7. So perhaps that's expected. Hence, writing 6.3 x10^-7 M.

Wait, but if Kf is considered exact, the answer is exactly sqrt( (0.02) / (5e10) ) = sqrt( (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = sqrt( (2/5) * 1e-12 ) = sqrt(0.4 * 1e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) as before. Anyway, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 6.324e-7. So 6.32e-7 would be three sig figs, but 0.02 is two. So 6.3e-7 is correct with two sig figs.

So summarizing all this, the answer is 6.3 x 10^-7 M. But to check one more time, perhaps I made a mistake with the stability constant. Let me recall that log Kf for Ca-EDTA is actually around 10.7, which would make Kf around 5x10^10. Which aligns with the problem's given K. So assuming everything is correct, so then the calculation is correct. 

Therefore, finally, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

So, this becomes 6.32e-7 when using three significant figures, but perhaps 6e-7 with one significant figure (following K). If the problem allows for two significant figures (given as 0.02), then 6.3e-7. But let's verify how the problem states the concentration: 0.02 M. Writing without an explicit decimal (like 0.02 instead of 0.020) is two significant figures. Therefore, perhaps the answer should be 6.3e-7 M with two significant figures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is meant to be represented more formally. But I think the correct value would be sqrt(4e-13) which equals 2e-6.5, but written as 2 x 10^(-6.5) M. However, in standard scientific notation, we don't keep exponents with decimals.

Alternatively, rounding to one significant figure (since K is given as 5e10, one sig fig) --- would make it 6e-7. Hmm, but typically, the value with more precise numbers is given, but perhaps the rules of significant figures here would be dependent on the problem.

So Kf = [CaEDTA]/[Ca²+][EDTA⁴-] = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10. Solving for x squared: x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13. Then x = sqrt(4e-13) is the same as before. So, same calculation. So, answer same as before.\n\nAnother check here would be seeing whether the pH being ideal plays any role. The problem states the pH is ideal for the Ca-EDTA complex. EDTA's ability to form complexes is highly pH dependent. At the ideal pH (usually around pH 10 for Ca-EDTA), the EDTA exists predominantly in its deprotonated form (Y⁴−), so we can assume that under such conditions, there's no competition between hydrogen ions and calcium ions for EDTA binding. Hence, the concentration of available EDTA^4− is not limited by protonation. Thus, the assumption that [EDTA⁴−] equals x (same as [Ca²+]) is valid here. So the earlier calculation holds. So we don't need to adjust for any protonation states because pH is optimal, which probably means that all EDTA is in the Y⁴− form.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA solution at pH 25 °C with a stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Reaction and Assumptions**:
   The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is represented by:
   \[
   \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
   \]
   Let the equilibrium concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) be \(x\). Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\), and \([\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02\) (as \(x\) is very small).

2. **Dissociation Constant**:
   The dissociation constant \(K_d\) is the reciprocal of the stability constant:
   \[
   K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
   \]
   Using the expression for \(K_d\):
   \[
   K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
   \]
   
3. **Solving for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Significant Figures**:
   Considering the significant figures from \(0.02 \, \text{M}\) (two sig figs), the final answer is rounded to \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\).

**Answer**: The concentration of calcium ions is \(\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}}\).

Wait, but I could also compute it directly as √(4x10^-13) which simplifies to 2x10^-6.5. Converting 10^-6.5: 10^0.5 is √10 ≈3.16, so 10^-6.5 is 1/(10^6.5)≈3.16x10^-7. Multiplying by 2 gives ~6.32x10^-7 M.

But let me check again to prevent calculation errors. The Kd calculation was correct? Kf =5e10, so Kd=1/(5e10)=2e-11. Then, substituting into Kd = x^2 / 0.02. So x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5. Because sqrt(4) is 2 and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Now 1e-6.5 is the same as 1e-6 * 1e-0.5. That gives 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈3.162e-7. So x ≈2*3.162e-7 ≈6.324e-7 M.

Therefore, the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions would be approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. But perhaps for the sake of significant figures, given that Kf is 5x10^10 (one significant figure?), but the concentration is given as 0.02 M (two significant figures). Yet, in problems like this, sometimes even if the K has few significant figures, the answer might be provided with an order of magnitude, but perhaps we can take two significant figures here.

Calculating x = sqrt(0.02 * 2e-11). 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 * 2e-11 =4e-13. sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Now, 6.5 as an exponent. 10^-6.5 is 3.162e-7. Multiply by 2: 6.324e-7.

10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 1e-6 * (1/sqrt(10)) ≈1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈3.162e-7, so 2 * 3.162e-7 ≈6.324e-7. Hence, rounding to two significant figures: 6.3e-7 M.

So, sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5 or 3.16e-7. Then scale back to when we had 4e-13, that\'s (4e-13)^.5 = (4)^0.5 * (1e-13)^0.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.\n\nHmm. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. However, pH is stated to be ideal, which is important because the stability of EDTA complexes depends on pH. EDTA exists in different protonation states, and the effective formation constant includes the conditional formation constant. But in this case, the problem states "pH is ideal", which probably implies that it\'s at a pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated, ensuring that the reported Kf can be used directly. For EDTA, the optimal pH for Ca²+ complexation is around pH 10, where the Y^4- form is predominant, but since the problem mentions ideal pH for the complex, we can proceed with the given Kf without adjusting for pH effects.\n\nTherefore, given that, the major assumption is that EDTA is in the correct form and the dissociation is minimal. So, the [Ca²+] ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Translating this to proper significant figures: 0.02 M is given with two significant figures, and Kf is given as 5x10^10, which is one significant figure. However, typically, equilibrium constants given with one significant figure would not constrain to that, as common scientific practice would maintain precision based on input data. But since both given concentrations are 0.02 (two sig figs) and Kf as 5e10 (one sig fig), the concentration of calcium ions could be reported as 6e-7 M (one significant figure). Wait, but math gives me approximately 6.32e-7, which is like two sig figs if considering calculations. \n\nWait, original K is 5e10 (one sig fig) and 0.02 (two sig figs). When performing the calculation of sqrt(5e10*...). Aha, perhaps the key here is that Kf is limited to one significant figure. Therefore, the answer\'s precision would be limited by the data with the least number of significant figures. So 5e10 (1 sig fig), 0.02 (2 sig figs), the result would have one significant figure. Therefore, the calcium concentration is ~6e-7 M, which is 6 times 10^-7. But my calculation approximates that.\n\nAlternatively, potential that during calculation steps, when we calculated x= sqrt( 0.02 * Kd ), which is (0.02 * 2e-11 )^(0.5)—wait, let me check the setup again. \n\nWait, the Kd is 1/Kf. So, Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]/[Ca-EDTA]. Solving for that equation:\n\nKd = x² / 0.02 => x = sqrt( Kd * 0.02 )\n\nSo Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Then:\n\nx = sqrt(2e-11 * 0.02) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. If 0.02 is exact (like 0.020) but maybe the problem has... Well, given as 0.02 presumably, 2 sig figs, which gives us perhaps 6.3e-7 (two sig figs?), but Kf here is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) so when multiplying or dividing by something with significant figures, the result term should have the same as the least precise. Therefore, in this case, Kf has only one sig fig, so we might be limited to one sig fig. Hence, 6e-7 M Ca²+.\n\nAlternatively, the way equilibrium calculations are approached, sometimes even with the K given with few sig figs, people still present the answer calculated. Considering that textbook problems might expect an answer of 6.3e-7, or another number. Wait another check of the numbers:\n\nAlternatively, let\'s redo:\n\nGiven Kf = 5e10, which is 5.0x10^10? If we take it as 5.0, but per the question "KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10", so that\'s one significant figure.\n\nSo steps again:\n\nStarting with 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. At equilibrium:\n\nCa-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴-\n\nInitially: 0.02 M; 0 and 0.\n\nAt equilibrium: [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n\n[Ca²+] = x\n\n[EDTA⁴-] = x\n\nBut Kd = 1/Kf = (x)^2 / 0.02\n\nSo x² = (1/(5e10)) * 0.02 = (0.02) / (5e10) = 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004e-10 = 4e-13\n\nThus, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Recognizing that 10^(-6.5) is equivalent to 3.16e-7. Therefore, 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.\n\nSo, x ≈ 6.32e-7. Hence, [Ca²+] ≈ 6.3e-7 M.\n\nBut given that the Kf has one sig fig, the answer should be 6e-7 M. Depending on convention, sometimes two sig figs maybe acceptable. Let me check 0.02 is two sig figs. When multiplying 5x10^10 and 0.02, in terms of units, perhaps more?\n\nBut the x is obtained by sqrt( 0.02 / (5e10) ). The numerator is 0.02 (2 sig figs) and the denominator is 5e10 (1 sig figs). The answer thus will have one sig fig, therefore sqrt(4e-13) is 6e-7. So, yes, answer is 6e-7.\n\nAlternatively, the solution might, in an educational context, accept 6.3e-7 for the thinking, even if presented with two significant figures.\n\nWait, but if 0.02 has two significant figures and 5x10^10 has one, according to rules for measurement uncertainty propagation, through division and square root, the total number of sig figs is determined by the term with the least. So division of 0.02 by 5e10 gives 4e-13 (since 0.02/5 = 0.004 = 4e-3, then divided by 1e10 gives 4e-13); so 4e-13 has one significant figure (0.02 / 5e10 is 4e-13, in one sig fig; because 5e10 is one sig fig. So sqrt(4e-13) would then be 6e-7, where 6 is considered one sig fig. Therefore, more properly, you\'d stick to six times ten to the negative seven molar.\n\nAlternatively, the problem may take pH being ideal to mean that no protons interfere, and precise K is 5.0e10, but if K is exactly 5 and not 5.0 (in the problem stated as 5x10^10, that\'s one sig fig unless a decimal is indicated). Wait, the problem states "KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10", so without a decimal, so one significant figure.\n\nThus, with the rest, the answer rounds to one significant figure. The exact number we got is approximately 6.32e-7, so 6e-7 M.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps even the problem uses logarithmic approach. Wait, I\'ve seen some approaches where pCa is calculated, but I think given the setup above, the direct calculation gives the value we need.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that [Ca²+] ≈ 6e-7 M but since the exact calculation came to 6.32e-7, if permitted in the problem to use one sig fig, 6e-7 M. But maybe the answer is in two sig figs if allowed. Let\'s recount steps again.\n\nWait, given Kf is 5e10. BUT wait, Kf is as written in textbooks. Wait, check literature values. For example, the stability constant (log K) for Ca-EDTA is ~10.7, which for Kf is ~ 5.01e10. So 5e10 matches that. Therefore, some sources allows that Kf of 5e10 is two sig figs (if it\'s log K 10.7, so K = 10^10.7 ≈ 5.01e10). Then in that case, if they took log Kf as 10.7, then translates to Kf = 5.01e10. Maybe the problem omitted the decimal. So if Kf is taken as 5.0x10^10 (two sig figs, writing it as 5.0). But in the problem\'s statement, it says 5x10^10, which implies exactly 5 without a decimal. So maybe one sig fig.\n\nBut this is getting into minutiae. If accepting log scales are generally two decimal places. So per the problem, it\'s given as 5x10^10. So considering that, and the Ka, they likely expect the answer in 6e-7 (if one sig fig) or 6.3e-7 if allowed. Let\'s go with 6.32e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7 (2 sig figs), which considers that sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, and 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7 (conversion with 10^-6.5 equals sqrt(10^-13) which is as done before). So perhaps 6.3e-7, but perhaps even 6.32e-7 with more precision, even 6.3246e-7 if we really compute sqrt(4e-13). But again, based on calculator work.\n\nEither way, perhaps the answer is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M, but given the problem input, to one significant figure as 6 x 10^-7.\n\nBut, in the problem statement, it is possible that using exact calculation gives the correct neat value. For instance, if 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004e-10 = 4e-13, so sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2/ (10^6.5) = 2/(3.16227766e6) ) = approx 6.3245553e-7, which is 6.325e-7 approx., so two decimal places would be possible, but with 5e10 as one sig fig.\n\nAlternatively, see if there is another approach where perhaps the problem takes another definition. For example, stochiometric Ca-EDTA meaning that calcium and EDTA are in exact stoichiometry, perhaps association is 100% so no free ions. But that contradicts the existence of a stability constant. Hence, must have some dissociation.\n\nHence, the expectation may be that the answer is (sqrt ( c / Kf )) where c is the concentration. Therefore, alternative approach: Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) ) =  [0.02 ] / (x^2) = 5e10\n\nThus solving for x:\n\nx^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13, leading to x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = same as before. Thus, other routes lead to the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, involving the cube or another variables if protons were present but pH is ideal, but the problem states pH is ideal which implies that EDTA is not pH affected, so we don\'t need to take into account the EDTA protonation. Without the acid-base complications.\n\nSo, given all the back and forth, the concentration of calcium ions would be 6.3e-7 M, and accounting for significant figures as allowed, the answer is likely 6 x 10^-7 M. To present this properly, I might write rounded to one significant figure, it\'s 6 x 10^{-7} M.\n\nWait, the Kf is 5e10 and given as one significant figure. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M (two). So in the calculation of x = sqrt( (0.02) / (5e10) ) = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = 6.3245e-7. The presence of two sig figs in 0.02 divided by one sig fig (5e10): the rule is you take the least number, which is one. So the answer should have one significant figure. So 6e-7. but some sources might say when the first digit is >3, like 6.3e-7 it’s one sig fig as 6e-7, or 6.x is considered as one, but double check: when you have 6e-7, that’s one sig fig; if you write 6.3e-7, that’s two, so violating because you divided by a one sig fig. So per rules, conclusion: should be 6e-7.\n\nHowever, I have to recall that maybe when forming x², 0.02 is a measurement with implied +/- uncertainty. Suppose 0.02 M means we know the concentration to two decimal places, which in strict terms is exact??\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is from an exam, answer expected may not stress over significant figures, but rather the magnitude. So 6.3e-7. Got to check if this value makes sense: Mg EDTA complexes have smaller Kf values, like 10^8, so [Mg²+] would be higher. For Ca-EDTA which has a higher Kf (5e10), the Ca²+ would be lower, meaning even smaller concentration. 6e-7 M for Kf=5e10, seems correct. If Kf were 1e10, then same calculation (sqrt(0.02 /1e10 ))=sqrt(2e-12) = approx 4.47e-6).\n\nWait, let\'s do that: Kf=1e10. So Kd =1e-10.\n\n[Ca²+] = sqrt(0.02*Kd)^0.5 ; wait.\n\nWait, similar approach: x^2 = 0.02 /1e10 = 2e-12, x = sqrt(2e-12)= approx 1.4e-6, which is higher. Therefore, with Kf =5e10, so 5-fold higher Kf, results in free Ca squared being lower.\n\nTherefore, here with Kf=5e10, 0.02 M → x≈6.3e-7. That is, higher Kf leads to lower free [Ca²+]. This aligns, yes.\n\nAlternative approach: Express it as pCa.\n\npCa = -log10([Ca²+])\n\nHere, [Ca²+] =6.3e-7, which equals log(6.3) + log(1e-7 ) ≈ 0.8 -7 = -6.2. Thus, pCa ≈6.2? Wait, wait: wait, log(6.3)=0.8, so 0.8 -7= -6.2. However, pCa is written as a positive number, so should be 6.2. If [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7, the pCa is 6.2. But the problem asks for concentration of Ca²+, so pCa isn\'t required. Just to check feasibility: The pH is ideal for EDTA, so perhaps at pH where EDTA is deprotonated.\n\nSo conclusion: The concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x10^{-7} M. Considering significant figures, 6 x10^{-7} M when rounded to one significant figure as K_f is given with one.\n\nBut here\'s a hiccup: if the problem says the Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, which could imply two significant figures. But since K_f is given with one, perhaps the concentration should be reported with one. It\'s possible the answer would give 6e-7 based on the K_f. However, in practice, for homework problems, even given 5e10 as one sig fig, unless instructed otherwise, people might just write 6.3e-7 or 6.32e-7 for better precision. However, since the stability constant is known more precisely (ca. log K=10.7; K=10^{10.7}=5.01e10), even though the problem lists K_f as 5e10. The discrepancy probably arises from the problem approximating log K=10.7 as K=5e10.\n\nTherefore, perhaps if we do exact calculation with K_f =5.01e10, we get sqrt(0.02 /5.01e10) is sqrt(0.02/(5.01e10))= sqrt(approximately 3.992e-13)≈ sqrt(3.992e-13)=approx 6.32e-7. If 5.01e10, this would be (0.02 /5.01e10)=3.992e-13. So sqrt =6.318e-7, which we round to 6.3e-7. Given that, regardless, the answer would stay at that number.\n\nSo, bottom line, the exact answer is approximately 6.3e-7 M, but written with two sig figs (from the 0.02), but since K_f has one sig fig, perhaps only one is acceptable. However, in absence of specific instructions here, perhaps safest to use two; given common practice, but perhaps that\'s subject to test\'s preference. Alternatively, given that 0.02 has two, and K_f given perhaps is known precisely but written truncated, teachers might accept that two is okay.\n\nBut since the user specifies K f as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), so here, my Final answer must adhere to that. So if I have to select as per significant figures, **6×10⁻⁷ M**, but note that it\'s one sig fig. Alternatively, 6.3×10⁻⁷ if allowed.  Considering that Chemists usually use the so-called "reasonable number" based on input, which in this case comes down to either one or two. Since the problem gives 0.02 as two and K f as one sig fig, per standard rules of measurements, calculations should be rounded to the least number of significant figures. Therefore, stick to one, hence 6×10⁻⁷ M.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe concentration of calcium ions is \\boxed{6 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744976067, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4720, prompt_tokens=935, total_tokens=5655, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start by noting the stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). This large value indicates that the Ca-EDTA complex is very stable, and dissociation is minimal.

The dissociation reaction is:
\[ \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the inverse of the formation constant:
\[ K_d = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11} \]

Let \( x \) be the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) at equilibrium. The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since dissociation is minimal)
- \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x \)
- \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \)

Using the dissociation constant expression:
\[ K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]} \]
\[ 2 \times 10^{-11} = \frac{x^2}{0.02} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x^2 = 2 \times 10^{-11} \times 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13} \]
\[ x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \]

Given the significant figures in the problem (0.02 M with two significant figures and \( 5 \times 10^{10} \) with one significant figure), the final answer should be rounded to one significant figure. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is:

\[
\boxed{6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}
\]

Hmm.

Wait, actually, 1e-13 is 10^-13. So, sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5 or 3.16e-7. Then scale back to when we had 4e-13, that's (4e-13)^.5 = (4)^0.5 * (1e-13)^0.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Hmm. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. However, pH is stated to be ideal, which is important because the stability of EDTA complexes depends on pH. EDTA exists in different protonation states, and the effective formation constant includes the conditional formation constant. But in this case, the problem states "pH is ideal", which probably implies that it's at a pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated, ensuring that the reported Kf can be used directly. For EDTA, the optimal pH for Ca²+ complexation is around pH 10, where the Y^4- form is predominant, but since the problem mentions ideal pH for the complex, we can proceed with the given Kf without adjusting for pH effects.

Therefore, given that, the major assumption is that EDTA is in the correct form and the dissociation is minimal. So, the [Ca²+] ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Translating this to proper significant figures: 0.02 M is given with two significant figures, and Kf is given as 5x10^10, which is one significant figure. However, typically, equilibrium constants given with one significant figure would not constrain to that, as common scientific practice would maintain precision based on input data. But since both given concentrations are 0.02 (two sig figs) and Kf as 5e10 (one sig fig), the concentration of calcium ions could be reported as 6e-7 M (one significant figure). Wait, but math gives me approximately 6.32e-7, which is like two sig figs if considering calculations. 

Wait, original K is 5e10 (one sig fig) and 0.02 (two sig figs). When performing the calculation of sqrt(5e10*...). Aha, perhaps the key here is that Kf is limited to one significant figure. Therefore, the answer's precision would be limited by the data with the least number of significant figures. So 5e10 (1 sig fig), 0.02 (2 sig figs), the result would have one significant figure. Therefore, the calcium concentration is ~6e-7 M, which is 6 times 10^-7. But my calculation approximates that.

Alternatively, potential that during calculation steps, when we calculated x= sqrt( 0.02 * Kd ), which is (0.02 * 2e-11 )^(0.5)—wait, let me check the setup again. 

Wait, the Kd is 1/Kf. So, Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]/[Ca-EDTA]. Solving for that equation:

Kd = x² / 0.02 => x = sqrt( Kd * 0.02 )

So Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Then:

x = sqrt(2e-11 * 0.02) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. If 0.02 is exact (like 0.020) but maybe the problem has... Well, given as 0.02 presumably, 2 sig figs, which gives us perhaps 6.3e-7 (two sig figs?), but Kf here is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) so when multiplying or dividing by something with significant figures, the result term should have the same as the least precise. Therefore, in this case, Kf has only one sig fig, so we might be limited to one sig fig. Hence, 6e-7 M Ca²+.

Alternatively, the way equilibrium calculations are approached, sometimes even with the K given with few sig figs, people still present the answer calculated. Considering that textbook problems might expect an answer of 6.3e-7, or another number. Wait another check of the numbers:

Alternatively, let's redo:

Given Kf = 5e10, which is 5.0x10^10? If we take it as 5.0, but per the question "KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10", so that's one significant figure.

So steps again:

Starting with 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. At equilibrium:

Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴-

Initially: 0.02 M; 0 and 0.

At equilibrium: [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA⁴-] = x

But Kd = 1/Kf = (x)^2 / 0.02

So x² = (1/(5e10)) * 0.02 = (0.02) / (5e10) = 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004e-10 = 4e-13

Thus, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Recognizing that 10^(-6.5) is equivalent to 3.16e-7. Therefore, 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

So, x ≈ 6.32e-7. Hence, [Ca²+] ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

But given that the Kf has one sig fig, the answer should be 6e-7 M. Depending on convention, sometimes two sig figs maybe acceptable. Let me check 0.02 is two sig figs. When multiplying 5x10^10 and 0.02, in terms of units, perhaps more?

But the x is obtained by sqrt( 0.02 / (5e10) ). The numerator is 0.02 (2 sig figs) and the denominator is 5e10 (1 sig figs). The answer thus will have one sig fig, therefore sqrt(4e-13) is 6e-7. So, yes, answer is 6e-7.

Alternatively, the solution might, in an educational context, accept 6.3e-7 for the thinking, even if presented with two significant figures.

Wait, but if 0.02 has two significant figures and 5x10^10 has one, according to rules for measurement uncertainty propagation, through division and square root, the total number of sig figs is determined by the term with the least. So division of 0.02 by 5e10 gives 4e-13 (since 0.02/5 = 0.004 = 4e-3, then divided by 1e10 gives 4e-13); so 4e-13 has one significant figure (0.02 / 5e10 is 4e-13, in one sig fig; because 5e10 is one sig fig. So sqrt(4e-13) would then be 6e-7, where 6 is considered one sig fig. Therefore, more properly, you'd stick to six times ten to the negative seven molar.

Alternatively, the problem may take pH being ideal to mean that no protons interfere, and precise K is 5.0e10, but if K is exactly 5 and not 5.0 (in the problem stated as 5x10^10, that's one sig fig unless a decimal is indicated). Wait, the problem states "KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10", so without a decimal, so one significant figure.

Thus, with the rest, the answer rounds to one significant figure. The exact number we got is approximately 6.32e-7, so 6e-7 M.

Alternatively, perhaps even the problem uses logarithmic approach. Wait, I've seen some approaches where pCa is calculated, but I think given the setup above, the direct calculation gives the value we need.

Therefore, my conclusion is that [Ca²+] ≈ 6e-7 M but since the exact calculation came to 6.32e-7, if permitted in the problem to use one sig fig, 6e-7 M. But maybe the answer is in two sig figs if allowed. Let's recount steps again.

Wait, given Kf is 5e10. BUT wait, Kf is as written in textbooks. Wait, check literature values. For example, the stability constant (log K) for Ca-EDTA is ~10.7, which for Kf is ~ 5.01e10. So 5e10 matches that. Therefore, some sources allows that Kf of 5e10 is two sig figs (if it's log K 10.7, so K = 10^10.7 ≈ 5.01e10). Then in that case, if they took log Kf as 10.7, then translates to Kf = 5.01e10. Maybe the problem omitted the decimal. So if Kf is taken as 5.0x10^10 (two sig figs, writing it as 5.0). But in the problem's statement, it says 5x10^10, which implies exactly 5 without a decimal. So maybe one sig fig.

But this is getting into minutiae. If accepting log scales are generally two decimal places. So per the problem, it's given as 5x10^10. So considering that, and the Ka, they likely expect the answer in 6e-7 (if one sig fig) or 6.3e-7 if allowed. Let's go with 6.32e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7 (2 sig figs), which considers that sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, and 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7 (conversion with 10^-6.5 equals sqrt(10^-13) which is as done before). So perhaps 6.3e-7, but perhaps even 6.32e-7 with more precision, even 6.3246e-7 if we really compute sqrt(4e-13). But again, based on calculator work.

Either way, perhaps the answer is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M, but given the problem input, to one significant figure as 6 x 10^-7.

But, in the problem statement, it is possible that using exact calculation gives the correct neat value. For instance, if 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004e-10 = 4e-13, so sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2/ (10^6.5) = 2/(3.16227766e6) ) = approx 6.3245553e-7, which is 6.325e-7 approx., so two decimal places would be possible, but with 5e10 as one sig fig.

Alternatively, see if there is another approach where perhaps the problem takes another definition. For example, stochiometric Ca-EDTA meaning that calcium and EDTA are in exact stoichiometry, perhaps association is 100% so no free ions. But that contradicts the existence of a stability constant. Hence, must have some dissociation.

Hence, the expectation may be that the answer is (sqrt ( c / Kf )) where c is the concentration. Therefore, alternative approach: Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]) ) =  [0.02 ] / (x^2) = 5e10

Thus solving for x:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13, leading to x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = same as before. Thus, other routes lead to the same answer.

Alternatively, involving the cube or another variables if protons were present but pH is ideal, but the problem states pH is ideal which implies that EDTA is not pH affected, so we don't need to take into account the EDTA protonation. Without the acid-base complications.

So, given all the back and forth, the concentration of calcium ions would be 6.3e-7 M, and accounting for significant figures as allowed, the answer is likely 6 x 10^-7 M. To present this properly, I might write rounded to one significant figure, it's 6 x 10^{-7} M.

Wait, the Kf is 5e10 and given as one significant figure. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M (two). So in the calculation of x = sqrt( (0.02) / (5e10) ) = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = 6.3245e-7. The presence of two sig figs in 0.02 divided by one sig fig (5e10): the rule is you take the least number, which is one. So the answer should have one significant figure. So 6e-7. but some sources might say when the first digit is >3, like 6.3e-7 it’s one sig fig as 6e-7, or 6.x is considered as one, but double check: when you have 6e-7, that’s one sig fig; if you write 6.3e-7, that’s two, so violating because you divided by a one sig fig. So per rules, conclusion: should be 6e-7.

However, I have to recall that maybe when forming x², 0.02 is a measurement with implied +/- uncertainty. Suppose 0.02 M means we know the concentration to two decimal places, which in strict terms is exact??

Alternatively, if the problem is from an exam, answer expected may not stress over significant figures, but rather the magnitude. So 6.3e-7. Got to check if this value makes sense: Mg EDTA complexes have smaller Kf values, like 10^8, so [Mg²+] would be higher. For Ca-EDTA which has a higher Kf (5e10), the Ca²+ would be lower, meaning even smaller concentration. 6e-7 M for Kf=5e10, seems correct. If Kf were 1e10, then same calculation (sqrt(0.02 /1e10 ))=sqrt(2e-12) = approx 4.47e-6).

Wait, let's do that: Kf=1e10. So Kd =1e-10.

[Ca²+] = sqrt(0.02*Kd)^0.5 ; wait.

Wait, similar approach: x^2 = 0.02 /1e10 = 2e-12, x = sqrt(2e-12)= approx 1.4e-6, which is higher. Therefore, with Kf =5e10, so 5-fold higher Kf, results in free Ca squared being lower.

Therefore, here with Kf=5e10, 0.02 M → x≈6.3e-7. That is, higher Kf leads to lower free [Ca²+]. This aligns, yes.

Alternative approach: Express it as pCa.

pCa = -log10([Ca²+])

Here, [Ca²+] =6.3e-7, which equals log(6.3) + log(1e-7 ) ≈ 0.8 -7 = -6.2. Thus, pCa ≈6.2? Wait, wait: wait, log(6.3)=0.8, so 0.8 -7= -6.2. However, pCa is written as a positive number, so should be 6.2. If [Ca²+] is 6.3e-7, the pCa is 6.2. But the problem asks for concentration of Ca²+, so pCa isn't required. Just to check feasibility: The pH is ideal for EDTA, so perhaps at pH where EDTA is deprotonated.

So conclusion: The concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x10^{-7} M. Considering significant figures, 6 x10^{-7} M when rounded to one significant figure as K_f is given with one.

But here's a hiccup: if the problem says the Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, which could imply two significant figures. But since K_f is given with one, perhaps the concentration should be reported with one. It's possible the answer would give 6e-7 based on the K_f. However, in practice, for homework problems, even given 5e10 as one sig fig, unless instructed otherwise, people might just write 6.3e-7 or 6.32e-7 for better precision. However, since the stability constant is known more precisely (ca. log K=10.7; K=10^{10.7}=5.01e10), even though the problem lists K_f as 5e10. The discrepancy probably arises from the problem approximating log K=10.7 as K=5e10.

Therefore, perhaps if we do exact calculation with K_f =5.01e10, we get sqrt(0.02 /5.01e10) is sqrt(0.02/(5.01e10))= sqrt(approximately 3.992e-13)≈ sqrt(3.992e-13)=approx 6.32e-7. If 5.01e10, this would be (0.02 /5.01e10)=3.992e-13. So sqrt =6.318e-7, which we round to 6.3e-7. Given that, regardless, the answer would stay at that number.

So, bottom line, the exact answer is approximately 6.3e-7 M, but written with two sig figs (from the 0.02), but since K_f has one sig fig, perhaps only one is acceptable. However, in absence of specific instructions here, perhaps safest to use two; given common practice, but perhaps that's subject to test's preference. Alternatively, given that 0.02 has two, and K_f given perhaps is known precisely but written truncated, teachers might accept that two is okay.

But since the user specifies K f as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), so here, my Final answer must adhere to that. So if I have to select as per significant figures, **6×10⁻⁷ M**, but note that it's one sig fig. Alternatively, 6.3×10⁻⁷ if allowed.  Considering that Chemists usually use the so-called "reasonable number" based on input, which in this case comes down to either one or two. Since the problem gives 0.02 as two and K f as one sig fig, per standard rules of measurements, calculations should be rounded to the least number of significant figures. Therefore, stick to one, hence 6×10⁻⁷ M.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.
