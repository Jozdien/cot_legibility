# Original Question

In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

In a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles exist, the Maxwell’s equations that would be different are Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law of induction. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (Original: ∇·B = 0)**: In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. If isolated magnetic poles exist, this equation must include a magnetic charge density (ρ_m). The modified equation becomes:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m
   \]

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction (Original: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t)**: In the presence of magnetic monopoles, moving magnetic charges (magnetic currents, J_m) would induce an electric field. This modifies Faraday's law to include a term for the magnetic current density:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m
   \]

The other two Maxwell equations (Gauss's law for electric fields and Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition) remain unchanged because electric charges and currents (both conduction and displacement) continue to behave as they do in our universe.

### Final Answer
\boxed{\text{Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law of induction}}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which Maxwell's equations would be different in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. First, I remember that in our universe, magnetic monopoles don't exist, which I think is why the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. That's one of Maxwell's equations—Gauss's law for magnetism, right? So if there were isolated magnetic charges, that equation would have to change to include a magnetic charge density, similar to how Gauss's law for electric fields involves electric charge density.

Let me write out the standard Maxwell equations to see:

1. Gauss's law: ∇·E = ρ_electric / ε₀
2. Gauss's law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Now, if there are magnetic monopoles, Gauss's law for magnetism (equation 2) can't be zero anymore. Instead, it should be ∇·B = μ₀ * ρ_magnetic, where ρ_magnetic is the magnetic charge density. Wait, but actually, comparing to electric fields, maybe it's just ∇·B = ρ_magnetic / some constant. Maybe similar to Gauss's law for electricity.

But also, if magnetic monopoles exist, then moving magnetic charges would produce currents, so maybe Ampère's law also needs to be modified. In our universe, Ampère's law includes the displacement current, but in the presence of magnetic currents, would there be an additional term? Similarly, Faraday's law is about changing magnetic fields inducing electric fields. If there are magnetic currents, maybe Faraday's law would get a term related to the magnetic current density.

Wait, in the standard Faraday's law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there's a magnetic current J_m, maybe it would become ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m? Or some similar modification. I think this is analogous to how Ampère's law includes the electric current J.

Similarly, Ampère's law might need another term if there are magnetic currents. Wait, but in standard Maxwell equations, Ampère's law has ∇×B proportional to the electric current and displacement current. If there's a magnetic current, maybe we need a separate equation or a modification.

Wait, perhaps another way. In the presence of magnetic charges and currents, both Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law would need to be adjusted. Let me check. So with magnetic monopoles:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (modified)
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (modified)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (unchanged, except maybe for symmetry if you consider duality)

But wait, in the standard equations, Faraday's law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic currents, then according to some references I remember, the Faraday's law would include a term related to the magnetic current. So yes, equation 3 changes. Similarly, Ampère's law in symmetric form would have a term from the displacement current, but with magnetic monopoles, perhaps there's a magnetic displacement current? Wait, no. Wait, classical electromagnetism doesn't include magnetic charges, so introducing them would require modifications to Faraday's law and the Gauss's law for magnetism.

Alternatively, I remember that in the hypothetical scenario with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become symmetric between electric and magnetic fields. So you would add magnetic charge density to Gauss's law for magnetism and a magnetic current term to Faraday's law, and similarly maybe a term in Ampère's law. Wait, no—Ampère's law is about how currents and changing electric fields create magnetic fields. If there is a magnetic current, how would that affect Ampère's law?

Hmm. Maybe the symmetry would make the equations look like this:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

So with this, equation 2 and 3 are modified. Equation 4 (Ampère's law) doesn't have a direct modification unless there's a necessity due to relativity or duality. But if magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations can be made symmetric. So in this case, Faraday's law gets the term -μ₀ J_m. So Faraday's law and Gauss's law for magnetism are modified, while the others remain the same. Wait, but Ampère's law as it stands in our universe includes the displacement current; introducing magnetic monopoles might not affect that.

Wait, let me make sure. In the standard Ampère-Maxwell law (equation 4), ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. So if you have a magnetic current, does this equation change?

Alternatively, if magnetic monopoles exist and can move, then there's a magnetic current J_m. Then analogous to how the time derivative of E is connected to the displacement current, perhaps the time derivative of B would be connected to something, but in the standard equations, Faraday's law uses the time derivative of B. If you have J_m, then the equations would become:

∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m (with constants).

Similarly, ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

So this way, both Ampère and Faraday have their counterparts. Therefore, equation 3 (Faraday) would change, equation 2 (Gauss B) changes, equation 4 (Ampère) remains as is? Hmm. Wait, but with this symmetry, perhaps Ampère's law would also need to include a term from the magnetic current? Wait, or not?

Alternatively, some sources suggest that the full set of Maxwell equations with magnetic monopoles are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

So here both Faraday's law and Gauss's law for magnetism are modified. Additionally, perhaps the signs might differ, but these are the modified equations.

In this case, the equations affected are equations 2 and 3. So in the original Maxwell equations, equations 2 (∇·B =0) and 3 (∇×E = -∂B/∂t); introducing magnetic charge density ρ_m changes equation 2, introducing magnetic current J_m modifies equation 3. Ampère's equation (4) isn't directly affected by the presence of magnetic monopoles, unless we consider some duality.

Alternatively, perhaps in another formulation, if you introduce a magnetic current and charge, you also need a corresponding term in Ampère's law? But I think that Ampère's law is a statement about how currents and changing E fields produce B fields, which isn't directly about magnetic charges. Whereas Faraday's law is about how changing B fields and (if they exist) magnetic currents produce E fields.

Alternatively, maybe if there's a symmetry, then the equations would require modifications in both the curl equations. For instance:

Original:
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (J_e + ε₀ ∂E/∂t)

With magnetic monopoles:

3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + ... some term?

Wait, in a truly symmetric formulation, the equations would be:

∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
∇·B = ρ_m / (something)
∇×E = -J_m - ∂B/∂t
∇×B = J_e + ∂E/∂t (with appropriate constants)

But constants and units might complicate things. For example, in SI units, the equations involve ε₀ and μ₀. The exact form may depend on how you define the magnetic charge and current. But the key idea is that in the presence of magnetic monopoles, both divergence of B is non-zero, and Faraday's law gains a term related to the magnetic current. So, which equations change?

In the normal Maxwell equations, equations 2 and 3 are the ones that assume no magnetic charges. Equation 2 is Gauss's law for B: ∇·B = 0. Equation 3 is Faraday's law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic monopoles, equation 2 would have a divergence proportional to the magnetic charge density. And Faraday's law would have an additional term due to the magnetic current density, similar to how Ampère's law has a term for electric current density. Therefore, equations 2 and 3 would be modified.

Hence, in this parallel universe with isolated magnetic poles, the modified Maxwell equations would be:

- Gauss's law for magnetism (∇·B = ρ_m / μ₀ or something similar) instead of ∇·B = 0.
- Faraday's law would include a magnetic current term, making it ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m or with some constants.

Ampère's law (equation 4) remains unchanged in this scenario unless there's a need to introduce some symmetry by adding a term related to the time derivative of the magnetic field or something else, but as per the standard treatment of magnetic monopoles, the prescription is modifying Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law. So, the answer is Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law are different.

Therefore, the equations that are different are equations 2 and 3. So in the original four Maxwell equations, the second and third equations (Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law of induction) would be modified in the presence of magnetic monopoles.

Wait, but I need to recall: when I derived Maxwell's equations before, the key idea is that magnetic monopoles would add a source term to Gauss's law for B, which is equation 2. They would also analogously add a current term to Faraday's law, equation 3. Where as Ampère's law and Gauss's law for E remain the same. Hence, only equations 2 and 3 are different. However, in some formulations, they might make everything symmetric, so maybe Ampère's law could also get a term? Wait, no. Because the original Ampère's law is about how electric currents and displacement currents generate B fields; even with magnetic monopoles, the generation of B fields via electric currents and displacement currents should remain the same. However, the existence of magnetic monopoles would imply that there are magnetic currents, which would affect the electric fields via Faraday's law. Similarly, how electric charges produce E fields via Gauss's law, and how moving electric charges (currents) produce B fields via Ampère's law. The key is symmetry. If you have magnetic charges, they would produce B fields via their "Gauss's law," and moving magnetic charges (magnetic currents) would produce E fields via a modified Faraday's law. That doesn't directly affect Ampère's law. Hence, I think equations 2 and 3 change, whereas 1 and 4 don't. So the answer is Gauss's law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's law (equation 3) are different, while the others remain the same.

But I should check some references, but since in this scenario we need to think hypothetically. Let me think again. In our universe:

1. Gauss's law: ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère: ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In a universe with magnetic monopoles:

1. Gauss's law: same, as electric charges still exist.
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (or with a different constant)
3. Faraday's law includes J_m: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m
4. Ampère's law remains the same unless there's a magnetic displacement current, which there isn't because displacement current is ε₀ ∂E/∂t, relating to electric fields. So Ampère's stays the same.

Therefore, equations 2 and 3 are different. Hence, the answer is that Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday’s law are different. So the ones that change are equations II and III.

**Final Answer**
The modified equations are Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law. In the standard numbering, these are the second and third equations. So the answer is \boxed{\text{Equations II and III}} or in boxed names: \boxed{\text{Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law of induction}}.

# Anthropic completion

I'm trying to determine which of Maxwell's equations would be altered in a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles (single North or South poles) can exist. In our universe, the non-existence of magnetic monopoles is reflected in Gauss's law for magnetism, where the divergence of the magnetic field equals zero. If monopoles existed, this equation would need modification to include a magnetic charge density term, similar to how electric charge density appears in Gauss's law for electric fields.

Let me review the standard Maxwell equations:

1. Gauss's law: ∇·E = ρ_electric / ε₀
2. Gauss's law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t

With magnetic monopoles, Gauss's law for magnetism (equation 2) would change to ∇·B = μ₀ * ρ_magnetic, or perhaps ∇·B = ρ_magnetic divided by some constant, analogous to the electric case.

Additionally, moving magnetic charges would create currents, potentially requiring modifications to Ampère's law. Similarly, if magnetic currents exist, Faraday's law might need an additional term related to magnetic current density, possibly becoming ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m or something similar, analogous to how Ampère's law includes electric current.

In summary, with magnetic monopoles present, the equations would likely change to:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (modified to include magnetic charge density)
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (modified to include magnetic current)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (potentially unchanged, except perhaps for symmetry considerations)

According to references I recall, Faraday's law would definitely include a term related to magnetic current in this scenario, confirming that equation 3 would change. Similarly, Ampère's law might require adjustment for symmetry...

I'm trying to determine which of Maxwell's equations would differ in a parallel universe where magnets could have isolated North or South poles. In our universe, magnetic monopoles do not exist, which is why the divergence of the magnetic field is zero—this corresponds to Gauss's law for magnetism. If isolated magnetic charges existed, that equation would need to include a magnetic charge density, similar to Gauss's law for electric fields that involves electric charge density.

Likewise, Ampère's law could require another term if magnetic currents exist. In the standard Maxwell equations, Ampère's law relates ∇×B to the electric current and displacement current. With a magnetic current, we might need a new equation or modification.

Considering magnetic charges and currents, both Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law would need adjustments, like:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (modified)
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (modified)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (unchanged, though symmetry might suggest a need for duality considerations)

In the standard equations, Faraday's law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, but with magnetic currents, it should incorporate a term for the magnetic current, confirming the change to equation 3. Similarly, Ampère's law's symmetry might suggest further modifications.

Actually, different conventions might handle this differently.\n\nAlternatively, in Gaussian units or other unit systems, equations look different. But since the question doesn't specify units, perhaps the essential point is that the divergence of B is proportional to the magnetic charge density, hence equation 2 changes.\n\nAdditionally, if there is a magnetic current density J_m, analogous to the electric current J_e, then there would be terms in Faraday's law and Ampère's law. But in the standard equations, only Faraday's law has a ∂B/∂t term. However, if you have a magnetic current, then there might be a term ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m or similar.\n\nLooking back at some texts I’ve studied, Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles are often written with symmetrized equations.

In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations would change to accommodate magnetic charge density and current:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism** (originally ∇·B = 0) becomes:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m
   \]  
   where \(\rho_m\) is the magnetic charge density.

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction** (originally ∇×E = -∂B/∂t) gains a term for magnetic current density \(J_m\):  
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m
   \]

**Ampère's Law** and **Gauss's Law for Electric Fields** remain unchanged because magnetic monopoles do not directly affect electric charge dynamics in these equations. The altered equations reflect the symmetry between electric and magnetic phenomena when magnetic monopoles are present.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

zed form when magnetic monopoles exist would have a term with J_m, but in standard Ampère's law, there's only J_e. Wait, no—Ampère's law accounts for the electric current. If there is a magnetic current, does Ampère's law need modification? Maybe it's in Faraday's law. Wait, perhaps:

Normally,

Maxwell's equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇·B = 0

3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t

4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

If you have magnetic monopoles, then equation 2 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (if we define it analogously to electric charge) but likely using a factor similar to Gauss's law. Wait, though, in SI units, Gauss's law has 1/ε₀, so perhaps for symmetry, the magnetic Gauss's law would have something else. Wait, maybe ρ_m is divided by the permeability? Actually, different conventions might handle this differently.

Alternatively, in Gaussian units or other unit systems, equations look different. But since the question doesn't specify units, perhaps the essential point is that the divergence of B is proportional to the magnetic charge density, hence equation 2 changes.

Additionally, if there is a magnetic current density J_m, analogous to the electric current J_e, then there would be terms in Faraday's law and Ampère's law. But in the standard equations, only Faraday's law has a ∂B/∂t term. However, if you have a magnetic current, then there might be a term ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m or similar.

Looking back at some texts I’ve studied, Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles are often written with symmetrized equations. That would mean:

∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀

∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m

∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

So, the differences would be in equations 2 and 3. The original equations 2 had zero divergence for B (no magnetic monopoles) and Faraday's law didn't have the J_m term.

Therefore, in this parallel universe with isolated magnetic poles, both Gauss's law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's law (equation 3) would be modified. Wait, but Ampère's law here (equation 4) remains with only J_e, whereas perhaps in some symmetric formulations you might also have a displacement magnetic current? Let me confirm.

Hmm. No, normally introducing magnetic monopoles adds a term to Faraday's law and modifies Gauss's law for B. Ampère's law remains as is, unless you also introduce magnetic displacement currents, but the displacement current in Ampère's law is already the electric displacement current. So maybe Ampère's law doesn't change. Let's check.

In the standard equations with magnetic monopoles, the symmetrized Maxwell equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m

3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

So indeed, equations 2 and 3 are modified, and equations 1 and 4 remain the same (except maybe in more symmetric formulations where Ampère's law could have another term, but I don't think that's standard. Usually, the symmetry is achieved by adding terms to Faraday and Gauss's magnetism equation, but leaving Ampère's as it is related to electric current.

Alternatively, some formulations might require Ampère's law to have a term related to the time derivative of the magnetic field's counterpart, but I think usually in the standard extension, only Faraday's law gains the magnetic current term. So Faraday's law and Gauss's law for magnetism would be different.

Therefore, the answer would be that Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law of induction would change. So, from the four equations, equations 2 (Gauss's magnetism) and 3 (Faraday's law) are different. Let me check a source or my reasoning.

Wait, if you have magnetic current J_m, then continuity equation for magnetic charges would be ∇·J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t = 0, similar to electric charges. To maintain consistency, Faraday's law, which relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B, will have an extra term accounting for the magnetic current. Therefore, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (with some constant factors). Similarly, Gauss's law for magnetism gets a divergence term.

On the other hand, Ampère's law, which initially was about ∇×B proportional to J_e and the displacement current, wouldn’t gain a term from magnetic monopoles directly. Unless you introduce a displacement magnetic current, but in normal derivations, the displacement current in Ampère's law arises from changing electric fields. So Ampère's law probably stays the same.

Hence, the modified equations would be:

Gauss's law for magnetism (∇·B = ρ_m) and Faraday's law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m), with appropriate constants. Therefore, in the scenario where magnetic monopoles exist, two of the Maxwell equations change: Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law.

But wait, another thought: in the absence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B is zero, but if they exist, ∇·B is non-zero, so Gauss's law for magnetism changes. Also, Faraday's law, which is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, would need an extra term if there's a magnetic current. Thus, both equations 2 and 3 are modified. Equations 1 and 4 (Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition) remain the same because Ampère's law deals with electric currents and displacement currents, while the presence of magnetic charges and currents affects Faraday's law and the divergence of B.

So the answer is that Maxwell's equations for magnetism (Gauss's law) and Faraday's law would be different. Therefore, equations 2 and 3.

In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations are modified to account for magnetic charge density and current:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism** becomes:
   - Original: ∇ · B = 0  
   - Modified: ∇ · B = μ₀ρₘ  
     This now includes a magnetic charge density term (ρₘ), analogous to electric charge density in Gauss's Law for electric fields.

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction** gains a magnetic current term:
   - Original: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t  
   - Modified: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ  
     Here, Jₘ is the magnetic current density caused by moving magnetic monopoles.

**Unaffected Equations**:
- **Gauss's Law for Electric Fields**: ∇ · E = ρₑ/ε₀ (unchanged).
- **Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition)**: ∇ × B = μ₀Jₑ + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t (unchanged, as it depends on electric currents and displacement current).

Thus, only **Gauss's Law for Magnetism** and **Faraday's Law** are different in this parallel universe. 

**Answer**: Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law are modified.  
Equations:  
∇ · B = μ₀ρₘ  
∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ.

Wait, but if we introduce magnetic monopoles, the fully symmetric Maxwell equations would have magnetic charge density in Gauss's law for magnetism, and magnetic current density in Faraday's law. But Ampère's law already has the displacement current. So, maybe only equations 2 and 3 would change. Alternatively, perhaps Ampère's law might also be adjusted to account for any new currents? Let me check.

Standard Ampère's law includes displacement current from the time derivative of E. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, though, would the equation for ∇×B change too? Unless there's a need for duality symmetry. If magnetic charges and currents exist, then perhaps Ampère's law would include magnetic terms, but actually, the original Ampère's law (equation 4) is about electric currents. The magnetic analog would affect Faraday's law instead.

Therefore, equations that would change are:

- Gauss's law for magnetism: adding magnetic charge density.
- Faraday's law: adding a term for magnetic current density.

Hence, equations 2 and 3 would change. Equations 1 and 4 would remain the same unless we consider dual symmetry, but I think traditionally only 2 and 3 get modified. Let me verify with formal sources. For example, in standard theory, including magnetic monopoles leads to adjustments in ∇·B and the addition of a magnetic current term to Faraday's law, while Ampère's law remains with electric current terms. Therefore, the answer should be equations 2 and 3 (Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law) would be different.

Wait, but sometimes it's said that if magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell’s equations become fully symmetrical with electric and magnetic charges. Then, modifying the equations respectively. In that case:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (modified)
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (modified)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (unchanged except perhaps with displacement current as is)
Hmm, but once there's magnetic current J_m, perhaps there needs to be a symmetry with how displacement current works? Alternatively, maybe it's J_e in Ampère's law and J_m in Faraday's law.

Another approach: to make Maxwell’s equations symmetric, when including magnetic charges and currents, the equations would become:

Gauss's law for E and B have their own charge densities.

Faraday’s law includes the time derivative of B and a term for magnetic current.

Ampère’s law includes the term for electric current and displacement current (time derivative of E). Similarly, if there’s a magnetic current, it goes into Faraday’s law.

Therefore, if both electric and magnetic charges and currents exist, then all equations would include terms where applicable. However, in the case where only magnetic monopoles exist without mandatory magnetic currents (which require moving monopoles), perhaps only Gauss’s law for magnetism is changed, and Faraday’s law might need an additional term if there are time-varying magnetic charge densities leading to a current. Wait, alternatively, to maintain consistency, if magnetic charges exist and can move (currents), then both Faraday’s law and Ampère’s law may require modifications. But I need to focus.

In the presence of isolated magnetic charges (monopoles):

- The divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, so ∇·B ≠ 0. Hence, equation 2 changes.
- If magnetic charges move, then there's a magnetic current density J_m. According to Faraday's law of induction, a time-varying B field induces an electric field; but with magnetic current, there would be an additional term. Thus, ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m, but I need to check the units. Similarly, how this might be added, similar to how Ampère's law includes J_e and displacement current. 
- If we keep Ampère's law as is (∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t), and modify Faraday's law to include J_m, then equations 2 and 3 are changed. Equation 4 might not change. But some sources (like Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics) use a symmetric formulation when magnetic monopoles are considered, modifying both Faraday's and Ampère's laws. However, in reality, since we don't have magnetic monopoles, those terms are set to zero.

Alternatively, here's the symmetric form of Maxwell's equations with both electric and magnetic charges:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In this case, both equation 2 and equation 3 are modified compared to standard Maxwell’s equations (where equations 2 would have ∇·B = 0 and equation 3 would have ∇×E = -∂B/∂t). So in the scenario described, the parallel universe where monopoles exist, the equations that differ are equations 2 and 3. Therefore, the answer would be Gauss's law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's law (equation 3). Equation 4 (Ampère’s law) remains the same as the original with only electric currents. Wait, but sometimes in symmetric formulations, Ampère’s law in presence of monopoles might also get an additional displacement term related to magnetic fields. Wait, no. Wait, the Ampère’s law in the standard case already includes the displacement current term (∂E/∂t). The presence of magnetic charges affects Faraday's law but not Ampère's law. Hence, in this scenario:

Modified equations are:

2. Gauss's law for magnetism: from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m

3. Faraday's law: from ∇×E = -∂B/∂t to ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

Hence, the equations that differ from the standard Maxwell’s equations are equations 2 and 3. Therefore, in such a universe, both of these equations would be different, while Gauss's law for electric fields and Ampère's law (assuming there aren't magnetic displacement currents) would remain the same.

But wait, the modified Ampère’s law could also be adjusted if magnetic displacement currents are considered. However, the standard displacement current is already ∂E/∂t, unrelated to magnetism. Unless the modification is part of making the equations symmetric. But typically, Maxwell’s equations when magnetic monopoles are considered require modifying Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law. Ampère's law stays with electric current and displacement of E. So yes, only equations 2 and 3 are modified.

To double-check references: a quick check from physics textbooks.

In the standard treatment, when introducing magnetic monopoles, two of Maxwell's equations change. Gauss's law for magnetism, ∇·B = 4πρ_m (in Gaussian units), and Faraday's law gains a term proportional to the magnetic current density. In SI units, this would look like ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m.

So definitely, the answer is Gauss’s law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday’s law (equation 3) would be different. Ampère's law remains as is unless considering some duality; however, since Ampère's law deals with electric current and the displacement current (from E), those wouldn't involve magnetic monopoles directly. So equations 2 and 3 would be the ones modified. Therefore, the answer should be Maxwell's equations for Gauss’s magnetism and Faraday’s law.

For example, the modified set would include ∇·B = ρ_m, and in Faraday\'s law add the magnetic current term, while in Ampère\'s law the electric current term would maybe not need modification. However, this depends on conventions. Some sources only alter two of the equations.\n\nBut in the standard treatment, Maxwell\'s equations with magnetic monopoles would adjust Gauss\'s law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday\'s law (equation 3). Ampère\'s law would remain the same, unless considering motion of monopoles contributing to currents which would then need to complement Maxwell’s equations. However, Maxwell’s equations without any enclosed current already includes the displacement current. Therefore: perhaps Ampère\'s law remains as is, and continuity equations for charge conservation must also include magnetic charges.\n\nTherefore, the likely conclusion is that in a universe with magnetic monopoles, equations 2 (Gauss magnetism) becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, and Faraday’s law (equation 3) becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t − μ₀ J_m. Therefore, two equations would change: the second and third. But different sources may handle this differently. Additionally, maybe Ampère\'s law would need a term if magnetic displacement current?

So in the presence of magnetic currents, maybe we have to add J_m but in a different equation. But perhaps no. Let me think.\n\nImagine dual transformations: electric and magnetic charges, along with their currents. So to maintain symmetry, both Gauss laws have their respective charge densities. Then Faraday\'s and Ampère\'s laws get the current terms. So Faraday\'s law equation 3 has a magnetic current term (since moving magnetic charges produce E fields via J_m), and Ampère\'s law equation 4, which in standard has J_e and ∂E/∂t, would not have J_m directly. Instead, magnetic currents would likely only appear in Faraday\'s equation.\n\nAlternatively, if full duality is applied:\n\n∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m\n\n∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e\n\nBut handling units and constants complicates. Let’s recall the standard expression. In SI units, if we have magnetic charge density ρ_m and current J_m, the modified Maxwell equations would become:\n\n1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀\n2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m           (Modified)\n3. ∇×E = − ∂B/∂t − μ₀ J_m  (Modified)\n4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t\n\nHere, Faraday\'s law is modified to include magnetic current. So equations 2 and 3 are modified. Ampère\'s law remains the same. Hence, in this universe, Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law would differ. However, in another perspective, when monopoles exist but there are no magnetic currents, only charges, then only equation 2. But if magnetic charges can exist and move, causing currents (J_m), then both equation 2 and 3. So, Faraday\'s law changes because a time-varying magnetic field already contributes, but additionally, a flow of magnetic charges (magnetic current) would also impact the electric field. So, I think that when you allow for magnetic monopoles, including their motion (currents), then two equations change: Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday\'s law. Therefore, the answer would be that Gauss\'s law for magnetism and Faraday\'s law would be different.\n\nBut in our original Ampère\'s law here, do we need to include anything else? Wait, symmetry might indicate that Ampère\'s law should have a similar term, but in standard form, it\'s handling electric currents and displacement. But the introduction of magnetic monopoles mainly affects the other sides of the equations that involve B fields.

In our universe, Maxwell's equations are formulated under the assumption that magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) do not exist. If such monopoles existed, two of Maxwell's equations would fundamentally change to account for magnetic charge density (\(\rho_m\)) and magnetic current density (\(\mathbf{J}_m\)):

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism** (Modified):
   - Original: \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0\)  
     (No magnetic monopoles.)
   - Modified: \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m\)  
     (Magnetic monopoles introduce a magnetic charge density.)

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction** (Modified):
   - Original: \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\)  
     (Time-varying \(\mathbf{B}\) induces \(\mathbf{E}\).)
   - Modified: \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m\)  
     (Magnetic current density \(\mathbf{J}_m\) also contributes to \(\mathbf{E}\).)

**Explanation**:
- The divergence of \(\mathbf{B}\) is no longer zero but proportional to \(\rho_m\), analogous to how Gauss's law for electric fields (\(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho_e / \varepsilon_0\)) includes electric charge density.
- Faraday's law gains an additional term (\(-\mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m\)) to account for the effects of moving magnetic charges (magnetic currents) generating electric fields, completing the symmetry with Ampère's law (\(\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_e + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\)).

**Conclusion**:  
If isolated magnetic poles exist, **Gauss's law for magnetism** and **Faraday's law** would differ from their standard forms. The other two equations (Gauss's law for electricity and Ampère's law) remain unchanged. 

\boxed{\text{Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law}}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

However, traditionally when physicists discuss including magnetic monopoles, they primarily adjust Gauss’s law and Faraday's law. Ampère's law in some formulations might also involve a magnetic current J_m if there's a symmetry.

Alternatively, depending on duality transformation, all equations could be symmetrized by introducing magnetic charge and current terms. For example, the modified set would include ∇·B = ρ_m, and in Faraday's law add the magnetic current term, while in Ampère's law the electric current term would maybe not need modification. However, this depends on conventions. Some sources only alter two of the equations.

But in the standard treatment, Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles would adjust Gauss's law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's law (equation 3). Ampère's law would remain the same, unless considering motion of monopoles contributing to currents which would then need to complement Maxwell’s equations. However, Maxwell’s equations without any enclosed current already includes the displacement current. Therefore: perhaps Ampère's law remains as is, and continuity equations for charge conservation must also include magnetic charges.

Therefore, the likely conclusion is that in a universe with magnetic monopoles, equations 2 (Gauss magnetism) becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, and Faraday’s law (equation 3) becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t − μ₀ J_m. Therefore, two equations would change: the second and third. But different sources may handle this differently. Additionally, maybe Ampère's law would need a term if magnetic displacement current? Wait, no. Wait, displacement current relates to changing electric field.

Alternatively, symmetry would lead to full duality: So:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m
3. ∇×E = − ∂B/∂t − μ₀ J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

This is the symmetric form when including monopoles. Hence equation 2 and 3 change, equations 1 and 4 stay as they are? That conflicts with intuition.

Wait, original Ampère's law with Maxwell's correction is ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. So in the presence of magnetic currents, maybe we have to add J_m but in a different equation. But perhaps no. Let me think.

Imagine dual transformations: electric and magnetic charges, along with their currents. So to maintain symmetry, both Gauss laws have their respective charge densities. Then Faraday's and Ampère's laws get the current terms. So Faraday's law equation 3 has a magnetic current term (since moving magnetic charges produce E fields via J_m), and Ampère's law equation 4, which in standard has J_e and ∂E/∂t, would not have J_m directly. Instead, magnetic currents would likely only appear in Faraday's equation.

Alternatively, if full duality is applied:

∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m

∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

But handling units and constants complicates. Let’s recall the standard expression. In SI units, if we have magnetic charge density ρ_m and current J_m, the modified Maxwell equations would become:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m           (Modified)
3. ∇×E = − ∂B/∂t − μ₀ J_m  (Modified)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Here, Faraday's law is modified to include magnetic current. So equations 2 and 3 are modified. Ampère's law remains the same. Hence, in this universe, Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law would differ. However, in another perspective, when monopoles exist but there are no magnetic currents, only charges, then only equation 2. But if magnetic charges can exist and move, causing currents (J_m), then both equation 2 and 3. So, Faraday's law changes because a time-varying magnetic field already contributes, but additionally, a flow of magnetic charges (magnetic current) would also impact the electric field. So, I think that when you allow for magnetic monopoles, including their motion (currents), then two equations change: Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday's law. Therefore, the answer would be that Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law would be different.

But in our original Ampère's law here, do we need to include anything else? Wait, symmetry might indicate that Ampère's law should have a similar term, but in standard form, it's handling electric currents and displacement. But the introduction of magnetic monopoles mainly affects the other sides of the equations that involve B fields. Let me check references.

From physics, when magnetic monopoles are accounted for, the divergence of B becomes non-zero (so Gauss's law for magnetism becomes similar to that for E), and Faraday's law gets an extra term of the magnetic current which couples E and B similarly to how the displacement current was added to Ampère's law. Ampère's law would remain as is. So, the modified Maxwell equations are:

1. ∇⋅E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇⋅B = ρ_m / μ₀  (assuming that in their universe, they use something analogous; units may vary)

3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t − J_m

4. ∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

But in SI units, I need to check constants. The standard treatment is proportionality constants, which might differ. For instance, if you take units where c=1, things can look different, but in SI units:

Gauss's law for magnetism would analogously have ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, since ∇·E is in terms of ρ_e / ε₀.

Then, for Faraday's law, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m. So yes, equation 2 and 3 would differ.

So, to answer "Specifically, which equations are different?" In our standard set, Gauss's law for magnetism (which states the divergence of B is zero) is changed to include a magnetic charge density, and Faraday's law is changed to include the magnetic current density.

Therefore, the affected equations are Gauss's law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's law (equation 3). Ampère's law and Gauss's law for electricity remain the same.

Wait, I should be more precise. Let's check the exact wording.

Original Maxwell's equations in SI units:

1. Gauss's law: ∇⋅E = ρ / ε₀

2. Gauss's magnetism: ∇⋅B = 0

3. Faraday's law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t

4. Ampère's law: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

With magnetic monopoles:

1. Unchanged

2. ∇⋅B = μ₀ ρ_m

3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t − μ₀ J_m

4. ∇×B remains involving electric current and displacement?

Wait, possibly the main change is ∇⋅B = μ₀ ρ_m in equation 2, and Faraday’s law in equation 3 adds a term for the magnetic current. Therefore, equations 2 and 3 change. Therefore, the answer is that Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law of induction would differ.
