To find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions with the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

Rewriting the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates \( x \) and \( y \) (where \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \)):

\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2} k x^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2} ky^2
\]

This potential represents an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. The corresponding angular frequencies are:

\[
\omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \quad \text{and} \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

The energy levels for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the sum of the energies from each direction:

\[
E = \hbar \omega_x \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right) + \hbar \omega_y \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)
\]

Substituting the angular frequencies:

\[
E = \hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right) + \hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)
\]

Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2 \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right) \right]
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the brackets:

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( 2n_x + 1 + n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right)
\]

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by:

\[
\boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \dfrac{3}{2}\right)}
\]

where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).

Okay, so I need to find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle moving in two dimensions with the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, let me start by recalling how to deal with potentials in polar coordinates. Since the potential is given in terms of r and θ, polar coordinates seem appropriate here. But wait, the potential isn't just radial—it has an angular dependence as well because of the cos²θ term. That complicates things a bit because the potential isn't spherically symmetric; it depends on the angle. 

In standard quantum mechanics problems with radial symmetry, we can separate variables into radial and angular parts. Here, maybe I can still attempt separation of variables, but the angular part might not be the usual spherical harmonics. Let me write down the Schrödinger equation for this system.

In two dimensions, the time-independent Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates (r, θ) is:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²/∂θ² ) + V(r, θ)] ψ(r, θ) = E ψ(r, θ)

Given that V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me rewrite this for clarity:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]

So, V(r, θ) combines a radial term (1/2 kr²) and an angular modulation (3/2 kr² cos²θ). The challenge here is the angular dependence multiplied by r². If the angular part wasn't multiplied by r², separation of variables might be straightforward. However, since r and θ are coupled in the potential term, this complicates things.

Wait, but maybe the potential can still be separated into r and θ parts if we factor it correctly. Let me think: V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ). If we factor that, it's like (1/2 kr²) multiplied by a function of θ. But in that case, the potential is not separable into a product of functions depending only on r and θ individually. Instead, it's a product of a function of r and a function of θ. Wait, actually, it is a product. Wait, (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) – so V(r, θ) = f(r)g(θ), where f(r) = (1/2 k)r² and g(θ) = 1 + 3 cos²θ. So if that's the case, maybe we can still try to separate variables.

But in the Schrödinger equation, if you have a potential that's a product of functions of r and θ, then perhaps you can write ψ(r, θ) as R(r)Θ(θ), and then the separation might work. Let me try that.

Substituting ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Θ(θ) into the Schrödinger equation:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) Θ + (1/r²) R d²Θ/dθ² ) + (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) R Θ ] = E R Θ

Divide both sides by R Θ:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/R)(1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² ) + (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) ] = E

Multiply through by -2m/ħ² to simplify:

(1/r R) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

But this is still a bit messy, since there's both r and θ terms mixed. Let's see if I can rearrange terms such that all the r-dependent terms are on one side and the θ-dependent terms on the other. Let's multiply through by r²:

[r/R d/dr (r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 kr^4)(1 + 3 cos²θ) + (2m/ħ²) E r² ] + [ (1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² ] = 0

Wait, this isn't helping so much. The problem is that the potential term has both r² and cos²θ multiplied together, so it's actually not separable into pure r and θ terms.

Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me think: maybe if I can rewrite the potential in a different form. Let's compute 1 + 3 cos²θ. Recall that cos²θ can be expressed in terms of double angles: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ. Wait, is that correct? Wait: 1 + 3*cos²θ where cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ. Yes. So the potential becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)*(5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ)

So V(r, θ) is now written as a sum of two terms: one radial term 5/4 kr² and another term which is (3/4 kr²) cos2θ. That is,

V(r, θ) = (5/4 k) r² + (3/4 k) r² cos2θ

But how does this help? Maybe we can consider the potential as a combination of an isotropic harmonic oscillator (the first term) and an angular-dependent perturbation. Wait, but perturbation might not be necessary. Is there a coordinate system where this becomes separable?

Alternatively, maybe use a different set of coordinates where this potential becomes separable. Let me recall that in problems with angular dependence like cos2θ, sometimes changing variables or using a Fourier series decomposition in θ helps. For instance, since cos2θ is a term that could be connected to the angular momentum or some angular excitation.

Wait, but the potential isn't purely angular—it is multiplied by r², so in the Schrödinger equation, the term with cos2θ is (3/4 k) r² cos2θ. So, when expanding the Schrödinger equation, even the angular term is multiplied by r².

Wait a second. The potential is actually V(r, θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ). So the total potential is 5/4 kr² plus a term 3/4 kr² cos2θ. Let's think in terms of harmonic oscillators. The first term is just a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential with a different spring constant.

Wait, recall that in 2D, the isotropic harmonic oscillator has the potential V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². Comparing with our first term here, 5/4 k r². So maybe we can set (1/2)mω² = 5/4 k, so ω² = (5/2 k)/m. Hmm, but that would be the case for a purely isotropic oscillator with this potential. But we have an extra term. Let's note that.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire potential can be expressed in terms of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Wait, in 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(x, y) = (1/2)mω_x² x² + (1/2)mω_y² y². But in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so V(r, θ) would be (1/2)mω_x² r² cos²θ + (1/2)mω_y² r² sin²θ. Let me see:

If we have V(r, θ) = (1/2)mω_x² r² cos²θ + (1/2)mω_y² r² sin²θ. Then, factorizing:

= (1/2)m r² [ω_x² cos²θ + ω_y² sin²θ]

Compare that with our given potential:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) [1 + 3 cos²θ] = (1/2 k r²) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ)

But in this form, we can set up equations such that m ω_x² = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) for the x-component and m ω_y² = 1/2 k? Wait, maybe. Let me check.

Wait, the given potential can be also written as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2 k r²) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ) = (1/2 kr²) [1 + 3 cos²θ]

But if we try to express this as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y) = (1/2) k_x x² + (1/2) k_y y².

Let's see, in Cartesian coordinates, r² cos²θ is x², so x = r cosθ. Therefore, the given potential is:

V(x, y) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x² + (1/2 k) y² = 2 k x² + (1/2 k) y²

Ah! So in Cartesian coordinates, this potential is separable into x and y components, each with different spring constants: V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2 k) y²

Therefore, the problem reduces to a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator with potential V(x, y) = (1/2)(4k) x² + (1/2)(k) y². Because 2k x² is equivalent to (1/2)(4k) x², and (1/2 k) y² is (1/2)(k) y².

Therefore, writing in terms of harmonic oscillators in x and y with frequencies ω_x and ω_y:

In the x-direction: 1/2 m ω_x² x² = 1/2 (4k) x² ⇒ m ω_x² = 4k ⇒ ω_x = 2√(k/m)

In the y-direction: 1/2 m ω_y² y² = 1/2 k y² ⇒ m ω_y² = k ⇒ ω_y = √(k/m)

Therefore, if this equivalence is valid, then the energy levels for an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2). Substituting the frequencies:

E = ħ*2√(k/m)(n_x + 1/2) + ħ*√(k/m)(n_y + 1/2) = ħ√(k/m)[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħ√(k/m)[2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

So the energy spectrum would be quantized with quantum numbers n_x and n_y (non-negative integers), with energies E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2). However, let me check if this transformation is correct.

Wait, when we go from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, the potential indeed becomes separable into x and y components. Therefore, even though the original potential is given in polar coordinates with angular dependence, writing it in Cartesian coordinates converts it into two independent 1D harmonic oscillators with different frequencies. Therefore, the solution would be in terms of the product of the eigenfunctions for each oscillator, and the energies would simply be the sum. Therefore, yes, this seems promising.

But let me verify that step again. Let me check my expansion:

Original potential: V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ). Which in Cartesian coordinates is 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kx². Since x = r cosθ, so x² = r² cos²θ, so 3/2 kx² = 3/2 kr² cos²θ.

So substituting, V(x, y) = 1/2 k (x² + y²) + 3/2 k x² = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + (1/2 k)y² = 2k x² + (1/2 k)y².

Yes, that's correct. So indeed, in Cartesian coordinates the potential is V(x, y) = 1/2*(4k)x² + 1/2*(k)y². So the potential is two independent harmonic oscillators, one in x-direction with spring constant 4k (since 4k = d²V/dx²), and one in y-direction with spring constant k.

Therefore, the frequencies are ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m), and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Then the energy eigenvalues for the 2D anisotropic oscillator are given by the sum of the 1D energies:

E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2) = 2ħ√(k/m)(n_x + 1/2) + ħ√(k/m)(n_y + 1/2) = ħ√(k/m)[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)].

Simplifying:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 1.5. Therefore:

E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where n_x, n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,…).

Alternatively, factor out the √(k/m) term. Using ω = √(k/m), which is the frequency of the y-component. However, the x-component has frequency 2ω. Therefore:

E = ħ(2ω)(n_x + 1/2) + ħω(n_y + 1/2) = ħω[2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħω[2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

Since ω = √(k/m), so the energy can also be written as ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2). This seems to be the energy spectrum.

But let me ensure this approach is correct. By transforming to Cartesian coordinates and identifying the potential as two independent oscillators, that should work because the potential is separable in x and y once expressed in Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, the separation of variables is possible, and the eigenfunctions are products of the x and y harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions, with the total energy being the sum.

Therefore, the energy levels depend on two quantum numbers n_x and n_y. But sometimes, in problems with a harmonic oscillator in polar coordinates, energy levels depend on other quantum numbers, such as radial and angular momentum quantum numbers. However, in this case, since the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, the appropriate quantum numbers are n_x and n_y.

However, maybe an alternative approach would lead to different quantum numbers? For example, in polar coordinates, attempting a separation.

But since the potential is not spherically symmetric (it depends on θ), the angular momentum is not conserved. So, I wouldn't expect the angular momentum quantum number ℓ to be a good quantum number here. In contrast, in Cartesian coordinates, the separability implies that the quantum numbers n_x and n_y are good.

So this suggests the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) with n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...

But wait, let me check if the mapping to Cartesian coordinates is correct. The original potential is written in polar coordinates, but for the purpose of quantization, one might worry about operator ordering issues. But since we're in 2D, and the potential can be re-expressed in Cartesian coordinates which are orthogonal, the separation is valid.

Alternatively, suppose I proceed with polar coordinates. Let's see if we can separate variables. The original Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is:

[- (ħ²/(2m)) ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²/∂θ² ) + (1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ) ]ψ(r,θ) = E ψ(r,θ)

As per earlier.

We attempt ψ(r,θ) = R(r)Θ(θ). Let's plug it in:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(R'' Θ + (1/r)R' Θ) + (1/r²) R Θ'' ) ] + [ (1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ) R Θ ] = E R Θ

Wait, let me compute the derivatives properly. In polar coordinates, the Laplacian is (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + 1/r² d²/dθ². So,

For ψ(r,θ)=R(r)Θ(θ), the Laplacian is Θ(θ) (1/r d/dr(r R')) + R(r) (1/r²) Θ''. 

So, substituting:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ Θ (1/r)(d/dr)(r R') + R (1/r²) Θ'' ] + [ (1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ ) R Θ ] = E R Θ

Divide both sides by R Θ:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(r R)) d/dr(r R') + (1/(r² Θ)) Θ'' ] + [ (1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ ) ] = E

Multiply through by -2m/ħ²:

[ (1/(r R)) d/dr(r R') + (1/(r² Θ)) Θ'' ] - (2m/ħ²) [ (1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ ) - E ] = 0

Rearranging terms:

(1/(r R)) d/dr(r R') - (2m/(2 ħ²)) kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ ) + (2m/ħ²) E + (1/(r² Θ)) Θ'' = 0

Wait, this seems messy. Let's try to separate the equation. Let me group terms in r and θ.

Let me let’s suppose that we can group the terms such that terms involving r are on one side and terms involving θ are on the other. Let’s rearrange the equation:

(1/(r R)) d/dr(r R') - (mk/ħ²) r² (1 + 3 cos²θ ) + (2m/ħ²) E + (1/(r² Θ)) Θ'' = 0

Multiply through by r² to eliminate denominators:

r (d/dr(r R')) / R - (mk/ħ²) r^4 (1 + 3 cos²θ ) + (2m/ħ²) E r² + Θ'' / Θ = 0

Now, grouping r and θ dependence:

[ r (d/dr(r R')) / R - (mk/ħ²) r^4 (1 + 3 cos²θ ) + (2m/ħ²) E r² ] + [ Θ'' / Θ ] = 0

Wait, but this is still not clean because the term with (1 + 3 cos²θ ) is multiplied by r^4. Hence, the r and θ variables are still intertwined. Therefore, the equation cannot be separated in this form, unless perhaps there is some substitution or identity we can apply.

Wait, earlier we noticed that in Cartesian coordinates the potential becomes separable. Perhaps despite the trouble here in polar coordinates, the Cartesian approach is better. Given that the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates and thus allows separation of variables, leading to the energy E as a sum of the x and y contributions.

Alternatively, maybe we can make a coordinate substitution or use a different angular basis. Let’s recall that if the potential has a term proportional to cos2θ, this might couple certain angular momentum states, but given that the term is multiplied by r², perhaps the radial and angular parts are no longer independent. However, since in Cartesian coordinates it's separable, maybe the polar approach complicates unnecessarily. Therefore, maybe it's better to switch back to Cartesian coordinates and solve it as two independent oscillators.

If the problem is separable in Cartesian coordinates, then the solution in terms of n_x and n_y is correct. Each 1D harmonic oscillator in x and y contributes (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x and (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y, and adding them together gives the total energy. Since in this case ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m), adding as follows gives:

E = (2√(k/m)ħ)(n_x + 1/2) + (√(k/m)ħ)(n_y + 1/2) = √(k/m)ħ [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)].

Simplifying:

= √(k/m)ħ [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = √(k/m)ħ [2n_x + n_y + 3/2].

Therefore, the energy levels are given by this expression. The quantum numbers n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,…). Therefore, the energy spectrum is:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)

Alternatively, if we express this in terms of the effective frequencies, we can introduce ω_1 = 2√(k/m) and ω_2 = √(k/m), then E = ħω_1(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_2(n_y + 1/2). But the expression above is simpler.

Alternatively, using the standard formula for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator, which in general is E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2), we have exactly this case. So yes, that formula applies here.

Just to confirm, let me look up the 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. For a potential V(x,y) = (1/2)mω_x²x² + (1/2)mω_y²y², the energy levels are indeed sums of each direction's energy. Since in our case, m ω_x² = 4k and m ω_y² = k, the frequencies are ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m). Therefore, the energy levels are indeed E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2).

Therefore, my conclusion is that the energy spectrum is E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers.

However, I need to confirm there isn't some hidden degeneracy or a different quantum number. But given that the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, the eigenstates are |n_x, n_y> with corresponding energies, and there isn't a different quantum number involved here. So the energy spectrum is as above.

But let me check for possible mistakes. For example, does the potential V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ lead to two independent oscillators in x and y?

We had V(x,y) = (1/2 k)(x² + y²) + (3/2 k)x², which simplifies to 2k x² + 1/2 k y². Therefore, it's like having k_x = 4k (because 2k x² = (1/2)(4k)x²) and k_y = k. So the frequencies are ω_x = sqrt(4k / m) = 2 sqrt(k/m), and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). 

However, oppositely, in the first term, the coefficient in front of the potential is 1/2 kr². When expressed in Cartesian coordinates, that's 1/2 k (x² + y²). Then, when adding the 3/2 kr² cos²θ, which is 3/2 k x², so total potential becomes 1/2 k (x² + y²) + 3/2 k x² = (1/2 k + 3/2 k)x² + 1/2 k y² = 2 k x² + 1/2 k y². Hence, yes, this splits into x and y components with spring constants k_x = 4k (since (1/2) k_x x² = 2k x²) and k_y = k. Therefore, the frequencies are as above. 

Hence, the conversion is correct, and the energy levels are E_{n_x,n_y} = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2) with the given ω_x and ω_y.

Another way to write the energy is:

E = ħ√(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ) ] = ħ√(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 + 1/2 ] but no, wait:

Wait,

2(n_x + 1/2) = 2n_x + 1

(n_y + 1/2) = n_y + 0.5

So total:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 1.5

Therefore,

E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), since 1.5 is 3/2. 

Yes, correct. So that's the equation. Now, in such cases, the energy levels can also be labeled by a different set of quantum numbers if there's an alternative separation, but since the problem is separable into x and y, the standard approach results in n_x and n_y. 

Alternatively, perhaps people might use a single quantum number if it's related to another symmetry, but given that the oscillator is anisotropic, I don't think there's an additional symmetry here. Therefore, I think the energy spectrum is as above, with quantum numbers n_x and n_y.

But wait, let's verify for a specific case. Suppose n_x=0 and n_y=0. Then the energy is (3/2)ħ√(k/m). If n_x=1, n_y=0, the energy is (2 + 0 + 3/2)ħ√(k/m) ) = (3.5)ħ√(k/m). If n_x=0, n_y=1: (0 + 1 + 1.5 )= 2.5ħ√(k/m). So the spacing is different for each direction, which makes sense as the frequencies are different.

Therefore, the energy levels are quantized in this manner. Now, to present the final answer, we can use either form. Since the problem mentions expressing the energy spectrum, the answer is in terms of these quantum numbers n_x and n_y.

Alternatively, maybe we can simplify the expression by using a single quantum number by combining 2n_x + n_y into a single integer? Not sure. For example, let’s denote N = 2n_x + n_y. Then E = ħ√(k/m)(N + 3/2). However, N can be written as varying over integers but considering some constraints. However, 2n_x + n_y can take values like:

If n_x=0: n_y=0,1,2,... ⇒ N=0,1,2,...

n_x=1: n_y=0,1,2,...⇒ N=2,3,4,...

n_x=2: n_y=0,1,2,...⇒ N=4,5,6,...

Hence, N takes all non-negative integers, but some values of N may be achieved in multiple ways. For example, N=2 can be achieved by n_x=1, n_y=0 or n_x=0, n_y=2. Therefore, each N can correspond to multiple states, meaning the energy levels are degenerate where N is larger than 1. However, the problem specifies to find the energy spectrum—the set of possible energy levels—so perhaps expressing in terms of N would leave out the degeneracy information but state unique energy levels. However, I don't think they are unique. Since for each E corresponding to N, there may be multiple (n_x, n_y) which give the same E. However, wait: let's examine.

Take N as 2n_x + n_y. Then N can be any integer greater or equal to 0. For each N, the possible n_x can range from 0 to floor(N/2). For each n_x, n_y = N - 2n_x, which must also be non-negative. Therefore, for each N ≥0, the degeneracy is floor(N/2) +1. For example, N=0: n_x=0, n_y=0. Degeneracy=1.

N=1: n_x=0, n_y=1. Degeneracy=1.

N=2: n_x=0, n_y=2; n_x=1, n_y=0 ⇒ Deg=2.

N=3: n_x=0, n_y=3; n_x=1, n_y=1 ⇒ Deg=2.

N=4: n_x=0, n_y=4; n_x=1, n_y=2; n_x=2, n_y=0 ⇒ Deg=3.

Thus, except for N=0 and N=1, the degeneracy increases. But if the problem wants the energy levels enumerated without considering degeneracy, then they can be expressed as E_N = ħ√(k/m)(N + 3/2) where N is a non-negative integer. However, since the original solution (using Cartesian coordinates) results in E_{n_x, n_y} depending on both quantum numbers, even if those give the same N, but different states. Therefore, depending on whether the problem asks for the expression in terms of all possible energies (accounting for degeneracy) or just the formula, the answer differs.

But the problem says to "find the energy spectrum". Typically, the energy spectrum would be a formula giving all possible energies, which may be degenerate. So technically, the energies are given by E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) with n_x and n_y non-negative integers. However, it can also be represented as E_n = ħ√(k/m)(n + 3/2) where n is a non-negative integer of the form n = 2n_x + n_y. But in that case, each energy level for n ≥0 is comprised of multiple (n_x, n_y) pairs with n=2n_x + n_y, hence the degeneracy for each n is as discussed. However, since the quantum numbers n_x and n_y are independent, perhaps the most accurate way is to denote the energy as depending on both. To avoid confusion, the answer should specify the formula with both quantum numbers.

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,…). Alternatively, sometimes books write energies in terms of ħω, so if we define ω = √(k/m), then E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2). Or since ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω, so E = (2n_x + 1/2) ħω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ħω_y, which combined would not collapse like earlier, but since substitutions can be made, perhaps writing in terms of a single frequency is simpler.

Alternatively, note that some references consider different way of combining the frequencies. I need to check if the calculus done here is consistent.

Alternatively, once we write ω_x = 2√(k/m), ω_y=√(k/m), then the energy is:

E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2)

Substituting ω_x=2√(k/m) and ω_y=√(k/m):

E = ħ*2√(k/m)*(n_x + 1/2) + ħ*√(k/m)*(n_y + 1/2)

Factor out ħ√(k/m):

E = ħ√(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Operate the terms inside the brackets:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 0.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 1.5 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2

Therefore it simplifies as:

E = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2)

Which agrees with the previous result.

Therefore, the energy is in terms of number operators for the x and y directions. Thus, the conclusion stands. The energy spectrum is quantized as above with quantum numbers n_x and n_y.

Thus, the answer is:

The energy spectrum is given by E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,…).

Alternatively, if simplification is desired, combining 2n_x + n_y into a single variable, but I think the two quantum numbers are necessary.

To present this properly, since in the problem statement only variables m and k are given, and the answer must be presented in a box as the final answer, presumably using LaTeX. It would typically be written with the quantum numbers and the expression. Also, note that ħ is present.

So:

The energy levels are E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right) for non-negative integers n_x, n_y.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is:

E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \dfrac{3}{2}\right)

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \dfrac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle moving in two dimensions with the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, let me start by recalling how to deal with potentials in polar coordinates. Since the potential is given in terms of r and θ, polar coordinates seem appropriate here. But wait, the potential isn't just radial—it has an angular dependence as well because of the cos²θ term. That complicates things a bit because the potential isn't spherically symmetric; it depends on the angle. 

In standard quantum mechanics problems with radial symmetry, we can separate variables into radial and angular parts. Here, maybe I can still attempt separation of variables, but the angular part might not be the usual spherical harmonics. Let me write down the Schrödinger equation for this system.

In two dimensions, the time-independent Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates (r, θ) is:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²/∂θ² ) + V(r, θ)] ψ(r, θ) = E ψ(r, θ)

Given that V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me rewrite this for clarity:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]

So, V(r, θ) combines a radial term (1/2 kr²) and an angular modulation (3/2 kr² cos²θ). The challenge here is the angular dependence multiplied by r². If the angular part wasn't multiplied by r², separation of variables might be straightforward. However, since r and θ are coupled in the potential term, this complicates things.

Wait, but maybe the potential can still be separated into r and θ parts if we factor it correctly. Let me think: V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ). If we factor that, it's like (1/2 kr²) multiplied by a function of θ. But in that case, the potential is not separable into a product of functions depending only on r and θ individually. Instead, it's a product of a function of r and a function of θ. Wait, actually, it is a product. Wait, (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) – so V(r, θ) = f(r)g(θ), where f(r) = (1/2 k)r² and g(θ) = 1 + 3 cos²θ. So if that's the case, maybe we can still try to separate variables.

But in the Schrödinger equation, if you have a potential that's a product of functions of r and θ, then perhaps you can write ψ(r, θ) as R(r)Θ(θ), and then the separation might work. Let me try that.

Substituting ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Θ(θ) into the Schrödinger equation:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) Θ + (1/r²) R d²Θ/dθ² ) + (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) R Θ ] = E R Θ

Divide both sides by R Θ:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/R)(1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² ) + (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) ] = E

Multiply through by -2m/ħ² to simplify:

(1/r R) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

But this is still a bit messy, since there's both r and θ terms mixed. Let's see if I can rearrange terms such that all the r-dependent terms are on one side and the θ-dependent terms on the other. Let's multiply through by r²:

[r/R d/dr (r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 kr^4)(1 + 3 cos²θ) + (2m/ħ²) E r² ] + [ (1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² ] = 0

Wait, this isn't helping so much. The problem is that the potential term has both r² and cos²θ multiplied together, so it's actually not separable into pure r and θ terms.

Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach. Let me think: maybe if I can rewrite the potential in a different form. Let's compute 1 + 3 cos²θ. Recall that cos²θ can be expressed in terms of double angles: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ. Wait, is that correct? Wait: 1 + 3*cos²θ where cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ. Yes. So the potential becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)*(5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ)

So V(r, θ) is now written as a sum of two terms: one radial term 5/4 kr² and another term which is (3/4 kr²) cos2θ. That is,

V(r, θ) = (5/4 k) r² + (3/4 k) r² cos2θ

But how does this help? Maybe we can consider the potential as a combination of an isotropic harmonic oscillator (the first term) and an angular-dependent perturbation. Wait, but perturbation might not be necessary. Is there a coordinate system where this becomes separable?

Alternatively, maybe use a different set of coordinates where this potential becomes separable. Let me recall that in problems with angular dependence like cos2θ, sometimes changing variables or using a Fourier series decomposition in θ helps. For instance, since cos2θ is a term that could be connected to the angular momentum or some angular excitation.

Wait, but the potential isn't purely angular—it is multiplied by r², so in the Schrödinger equation, the term with cos2θ is (3/4 k) r² cos2θ. So, when expanding the Schrödinger equation, even the angular term is multiplied by r².

Wait a second. The potential is actually V(r, θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ). So the total potential is 5/4 kr² plus a term 3/4 kr² cos2θ. Let's think in terms of harmonic oscillators. The first term is just a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential with a different spring constant.

Wait, recall that in 2D, the isotropic harmonic oscillator has the potential V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². Comparing with our first term here, 5/4 k r². So maybe we can set (1/2)mω² = 5/4 k, so ω² = (5/2 k)/m. Hmm, but that would be the case for a purely isotropic oscillator with this potential. But we have an extra term. Let's note that.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire potential can be expressed in terms of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Wait, in 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(x, y) = (1/2)mω_x² x² + (1/2)mω_y² y². But in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so V(r, θ) would be (1/2)mω_x² r² cos²θ + (1/2)mω_y² r² sin²θ. Let me see:

If we have V(r, θ) = (1/2)mω_x² r² cos²θ + (1/2)mω_y² r² sin²θ. Then, factorizing:

= (1/2)m r² [ω_x² cos²θ + ω_y² sin²θ]

Compare that with our given potential:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) [1 + 3 cos²θ] = (1/2 k r²) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ)

But in th

I need to determine the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle moving in two dimensions with the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Since the potential is expressed in polar coordinates, I'll start with this approach, though I notice there's angular dependence due to the cos²θ term, which means the potential isn't spherically symmetric.

In quantum mechanics problems with radial symmetry, we typically separate variables into radial and angular components. Let me see if that's possible here by writing the time-independent Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates for two dimensions:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²/∂θ² ) + V(r, θ)] ψ(r, θ) = E ψ(r, θ)

Looking at the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ, I can rearrange it as:
V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]

This combines a radial term with an angular modulation. The challenge is that r and θ are coupled in the potential, since the angular part is multiplied by r². Let me see if I can factor this: V(r, θ) = f(r)g(θ), where f(r) = (1/2)kr² and g(θ) = 1 + 3cos²θ.

Let's try separation of variables by assuming ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Θ(θ) and substituting into the Schrödinger equation:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) Θ + (1/r²) R d²Θ/dθ² ) + (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) R Θ ] = E R Θ

Dividing by R Θ:
[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/R)(1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² ) + (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) ] = E

Multiplying through by -2m/ħ²:
(1/r R) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

Unfortunately, there's still a mix of r and θ terms, making separation difficult. Let me try a different approach by rewriting the angular part. Using the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2:

1 + 3cos²θ = 1 + 3(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ

So the potential becomes:
V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)(5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ)

This representation shows the potential as a sum of an isotropic harmonic oscillator term (5/4)kr² and an angular-dependent term (3/4)kr²cos2θ.

Perhaps we can interpret this in terms of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. In Cartesian coordinates, an anisotropic oscillator has potential V(x,y) = (1/2)mω₁²x² + (1/2)mω₂²y². Converting to polar coordinates with x = rcosθ and y = rsinθ:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)mω₁²r²cos²θ + (1/2)mω₂²r²sin²θ
       = (1/2)mr² [ω₁²cos²θ + ω₂²sin²θ]

Comparing with our potential (1/2)kr²[1 + 3cos²θ], we might find a relationship between k and the frequencies ω₁ and ω₂.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle in two dimensions with the potential given by V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let's start by tackling potentials in polar coordinates. Since the potential is expressed in terms of r and θ, using polar coordinates is fitting. However, note that the potential isn't merely radial because it includes an angular term due to cos²θ, which makes it angular-dependent. This adds complexity as the potential isn’t spherically symmetric.

In typical quantum mechanical problems with radial symmetry, the separation of variables into radial and angular components is viable. Here, I might still separate the variables, although the angular component may not align with standard spherical harmonics. Time to jot down the Schrödinger equation for this context.

In two dimensions, within polar coordinates (r, θ), the time-independent Schrödinger equation is:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²/∂θ² ) + V(r, θ)] ψ(r, θ) = E ψ(r, θ).

Given V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ, let’s revise it for clarity:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ].

Thus, V(r, θ) integrates a radial part (1/2 kr²) and an angular term (3/2 kr² cos²θ), and the angular dependency is scaled with r², complicating separation of variables. But, it could still be feasible to separate r and θ if viewed as a product: V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ), relating f(r) = (1/2 k)r² and g(θ) = 1 + 3 cos²θ.

Inserting ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Θ(θ) into the Schrödinger equation:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) Θ + (1/r²) R d²Θ/dθ² ) + (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) R Θ ] = E R Θ.

Dividing by R Θ gives:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/R)(1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² ) + (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) ] = E.

Elevate through by -2m/ħ² for simplification:

(1/r R) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E.

Multiplying by r²:

[r/R d/dr (r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(1/2 kr^4)(1 + 3 cos²θ) + (2m/ħ²) E r² ] + [ (1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² ] = 0.

Rewriting the potential differently might help. Express cos²θ with double angles: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2:

1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ.

Hence, revising the potential:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)*(5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ).

So V(r, θ) splits into a 5/4 kr² term and a 3/4 kr² cos2θ part.

Considering these: the first is akin to a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator with a perturbed angular term. Recall that in isotropic 2D harmonics, V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². If set to 5/4 kr², present (1/2)mω² = 5/4 k letting ω² = (5/2 k)/m. Despite the added term, this derived potential can aid in analyzing it as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator.

Exploring x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ allows: V(r, θ) = (1/2)mω_x² r² cos²θ + (1/2)mω_y² r² sin²θ. Factorverts to: (1/2)m r² [ω_x² cos²θ + ω_y² sin²θ], aligning with V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. So this isn’t aligning correctly, but using coordinates that suit consider partitioning or transformation helps, especially where cos2θ acts as an angular term possibly linked to angular momentum or excitations. Reclassifying this potential remains an engaging challenge, especially through harmonic comparisons.

Wait, but sin²θ can't be matched like that unless ω_y = 0, which can't be right. Wait, but the constant term k complicates things. Wait, notice that on the right-hand side, we have k + 3k cos²θ. Let me try to represent k as a term proportional to (cos²θ + sin²θ):\n\nk (cos²θ + sin²θ) + 2k cos²θ = 3k cos²θ + k sin²θ\n\nWait, that gives 3k cos²θ + k sin²θ. But our potential is k (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2, or am I getting confused here?\n\nWait, let me get back. Originally, in our potential, after expanding cos²θ, we found:\n\nV(r, θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ)\n\nBut perhaps that approach complicated things. Earlier, trying to relate it to the anisotropic oscillator may not be helpful because of the mismatching terms. Let's try again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the original expression: V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) and try to massage it. Let me think in Cartesian coordinates. Since x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so cosθ = x/r, sinθ = y/r. Therefore, cos²θ = x²/r². Therefore, V(r, θ) becomes:\n\n(1/2 kr²)(1 + 3x²/r²) = (1/2 k)(r² + 3x²)\n\nBut r² = x² + y², so substituting, we have:\n\n(1/2 k)(x² + y² + 3x²) = (1/2 k)(4x² + y²)\n\nSo V(x, y) = (1/2 k)(4x² + y²). Aha! So this potential is actually a anisotropic harmonic oscillator in Cartesian coordinates with different spring constants in the x and y directions.\n\nWow, that seems more manageable. Why didn't I think of this before? So expressing V in Cartesian coordinates:\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2 k)(4x² + y²) = (1/2)(4k)x² + (1/2)(k)y².\n\nTherefore, this is equivalent to a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator with spring constants k_x = 4k and k_y = k. Thus, the potential can be separated into x and y parts. Therefore, the problem reduces to a 2D harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt(k/m).\n\nThus, since the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, the energy levels are simply the sum of the energies from each direction:\n\nE = E_x + E_y = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y + 1/2)\n\nWhere n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). Plugging in ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ * sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)\n\nFactor out ħ sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.\n\nTherefore:\n\nE = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nHowever, the standard form of energy levels for an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in 2D is E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2), so that expression is correct.\n\nBut let me check my steps again to be sure.\n\nOriginal potential given as V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ). When converting to Cartesian coordinates:\n\n(1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ) = (1/2k)(x² + y²) + (3/2k)x² = (1/2k x² + 1/2k y²) + 3/2k x² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².\n\nWait, seems like I missed a step here. Let me verify:\n\nOriginal potential: V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ.\n\nBut r² is x² + y², cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x² / (x² + y²).\n\nTherefore, 3/2 kr² cos²θ = 3/2 k (x² + y²) * (x² / (x² + y²)) = 3/2 k x².\n\nThus, V(r, θ) = 1/2 k (x² + y²) + 3/2 k x² = 1/2k x² + 1/2k y² + 3/2k x² = (1/2k + 3/2k) x² + 1/2k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, expressed as harmonic oscillators:\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2)(4k) x² + (1/2)(k) y², which corresponds to spring constants k_x = 4k and k_y = k, as I had previously. Therefore, the frequencies are ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). \n\nTherefore, the energy levels are indeed:\n\nE = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2) = 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)\n\nFactor out ħ sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]\n\nWhich gives:\n\nE = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nThus, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers n_x and n_y, which are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nAlternatively, to express this in terms of the classical frequency ω = sqrt(k/m), as in the standard harmonic oscillator. If we define ω = sqrt(k/m), then ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω. Therefore, we can write:\n\nE = 2ħω(n_x + 1/2) + ħω(n_y + 1/2) = ħω [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħω [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]\n\nAlternatively, collecting terms:\n\nE = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nHowever, typically the energy levels are written in terms of the sum of the energies in each direction. But given the form here, the energy is dependent on 2n_x + n_y, which means the levels will have degeneracies. However, the question simply asks for the energy spectrum, which is the set of allowed energy values, so the expression above gives the energy in terms of the quantum numbers n_x and n_y, which are non-negative integers. Thus, each energy level is determined by values of n_x and n_y, leading to distinct energies unless combinations of n_x and n_y give the same value of 2n_x + n_y. \n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum is E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) where ω = sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y are integers greater than or equal to zero.\n\nWait, but another way to express this is by defining a new quantum number. For example, let’s set N = 2n_x + n_y, then E = ħω (N + 3/2 ). However, since 2n_x + n_y can take values starting from 0 (when n_x = 0 and n_y = 0) giving N=0, 1 (n_x=0,n_y=1; N=1), 2 (n_x=1,n_y=0; N=2) or (n_x=0,n_y=2; N=2)), etc. So each N corresponds to multiple states, but the energy depends only on N. Wait, no. Wait, N is defined as 2n_x + n_y. So for each N, the possible values of n_x and n_y need to satisfy 2n_x + n_y = N. However, N is not a single quantum number but a combination. Hence, the energy levels for each N have a certain degeneracy, but the energy depends on N, so the spectrum is E_N = ħω (N + 3/2 ) where N = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nWait, but let me check with small N:\n\nIf N=0: Then 2n_x + n_y =0 ⇒ n_x=0, n_y=0\n\n⇒ E= ħω (0 + 3/2 )= (3/2) ħω\n\nN=1: 2n_x + n_y=1. Solutions: either n_x=0, n_y=1; or n_x=1/2, n_y=0. But n_x must be integer, so only n_x=0, n_y=1. Thus, E= ħω (1 + 3/2 ) = (5/2 ) ħω\n\nN=2: 2n_x +n_y=2.\n\nPossible solutions: n_x=0, n_y=2; n_x=1, n_y=0. Hence, two states here. Energy: (2 + 3/2 ) ħω = 7/2 ħω\n\nN=3: 2n_x +n_y=3. Solutions: n_x=0, n_y=3; n_x=1, n_y=1. So two states. Energy: (3 + 3/2 ) ħω = 9/2 ħω\n\nWait a minute, so N increases by 1 each time, and the number of states for each N depends on how many pairs (n_x,n_y) satisfy 2n_x +n_y = N. So the energy spectrum is quantized in steps of ħω, starting from (3/2)ħω, with each subsequent energy level differing by ħω. But with varying degeneracy.\n\nTherefore, the general expression for the energy is E = ħω (N + 3/2 ) where N is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...), and for each N, there are floor(N/2)+1 possible states (depending on how many n_x and n_y combinations yield the same N). But perhaps the problem just wants the energy spectrum in terms of the quantum numbers rather than in terms of N. Since in Cartesian coordinates the problem is separable into x and y, specifying n_x and n_y gives unique energy.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of polar coordinates quantum numbers, like n_r and m, but given that in Cartesian coordinates it's straightforward. Let's verify once again.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is separable in Cartesian coordinates, then the standard solution applies here. Each direction contributes (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x and (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y. As such, the energy would be:\n\nE = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2)\n\nGiven that ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω (if ω = sqrt(k/m)), then:\n\nE = 2ħω(n_x + 1/2) + ħω(n_y + 1/2) = ħω [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]\n\nThus, the energy spectrum is:\n\nE_{n_x,n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nWhere n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Therefore, each combination of n_x and n_y gives rise to a distinct energy level, unless 2n_x + n_y takes the same value for different pairs (n_x,n_y).\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express it in terms of some other quantum numbers, maybe in terms of the total excitation, but since the frequencies are different in x and y directions, the energy levels are not equally spaced in a way that would allow a single quantum number. However, the question just asks for the energy spectrum, so this formula should suffice.\n\nBut let's just check the dimensions. ħ√(k/m) has units of energy: since k has units of [mass]/[time]^2, sqrt(k/m) is 1/[time], so ħ times that has units of energy. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to write in terms of original parameters. Let ω = sqrt(k/m), then energy is:\n\nE = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nAlternatively, we can factor 3/2 as:\n\n(2n_x + n_y) + 3/2. So that matches.\n\nHence, the answer is expression in the form with quantum numbers n_x and n_y. But is there a better way? For instance, when converting back to polar coordinates, perhaps you can find a relation, but given that the problem is separable in Cartesian, and energy depends on the sum 2n_x + n_y, it's probably acceptable to leave the answer in terms of n_x and n_y.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be approached in polar coordinates. Maybe start in polar coordinates and attempt separation of variables. Let me see if that's feasible, just to check.\n\nWe had initially written the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates with the potential V(r, θ). After expanding cos²θ, the potential became V(r, θ)= (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ). So maybe try an ansatz ψ(r,θ) = R(r)Θ(θ), as before. Let me attempt that.\n\nSo plug into the Schrödinger equation:\n\n[-ħ²/(2m)( (1/r)d/dr(r dR/dr) Θ + (1/r²) R d²Θ/dθ² ) + (5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) R Θ ] = E R Θ\n\nDivide both sides by R Θ:\n\n[-ħ²/(2m)[(1/(R r)) d/dr(r dR/dr) + (1/(Θ r²)) d²Θ/dθ² ] + (5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) ] = E\n\nMultiply through by -2m/ħ²:\n\n[ (1/(R r)) d/dr(r dR/dr) + (1/(Θ r²)) d²Θ/dθ² ] - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E\n\nRearranged:\n\n(1/R r) d/dr(r dR/dr) + (1/(Θ r²)) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) + (2m/ħ²) E = 0\n\nNow multiply through by r² to separate variables:\n\nr/R d/dr(r dR/dr) + (1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 k r^4 + 3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) + (2m/ħ²) E r² = 0\n\nHmm, this is more complicated because of the r^4 terms. Unless we can express this in terms that separates into functions of r and θ. However, terms like r^4 cos2θ mix r and θ.\n\nAlternatively, we can bring some terms to one side. For instance, group terms dependent on θ and r:\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nr/R d/dr(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 k r^4 ) + (2m/ħ²) E r² + [ (1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) ] = 0\n\nBut even then, the term (3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) still mixes r and θ in the equation. So unless there's a substitution that can decouple them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expanding Θ(θ) in terms of eigenfunctions of the angular part that includes the potential term. But given that in the angular part there is a term with cos2θ multiplied by r^4, this complicates because r is a variable. In standard separation of variables, you'd split the equation such that the angular part is an operator depending only on θ, which then becomes an eigenvalue equation. But here, the angular term is multiplied by r^4, so when trying to separate variables, you would need something like:\n\n(1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) = - l(l+1)  (or some constant)\n\nBut this constant would involve r^4, which can't be. Thus, maybe separation of variables in polar coordinates isn't feasible here due to the r^4 cos2θ term. \n\nTherefore, confirms that treating the problem in Cartesian coordinates is the correct approach, as the potential became separable, leading to the energy levels found earlier.\n\nThus, the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).\n\nTo write this more neatly, we can use the standard frequency of the oscillator ω = sqrt(k/m), then E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects the answer in terms of polar quantum numbers, perhaps n and m, but since it's effectively a 2D anisotropic oscillator in Cartesian coordinates, which doesn't conserve angular momentum (since the potential is not radially symmetric), the good quantum numbers are n_x and n_y.\n\nHence, the energy levels are as given above, E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where ω = sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\nAlternatively, if the problem wants an explicit expression without referring to ω, then:\n\nE_{n_x,n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nTo confirm this answer, let's check when n_x = n_y = 0, we have E = ħ sqrt(k/m)*(0 + 0 + 3/2 ) = (3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m). This is the ground state energy for this system. The first excited states would be when either n_x=0, n_y=1 or n_x=1, n_y=0. Their energies would be:\n\nFor n_x=0, n_y=1: E = ħ sqrt(k/m)*(0 + 1 + 3/2 ) = (5/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)\n\nFor n_x=1, n_y=0: E = ħ sqrt(k/m)*(2 + 0 + 3/2 ) = (7/2) ħ sqrt(k/m )\n\nThus, differing by increments of ħ sqrt(k/m ) for different transitions. This makes sense given the anisotropic potential, leading to different energies for excitations in x and y directions.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), for non-negative integers n_x and n_y.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy spectrum is \\boxed{E = \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\left(2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)} where \\( n_x \\) and \\( n_y \\) are non-negative integers.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744975918, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5296, prompt_tokens=1997, total_tokens=7293, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions with the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

Rewriting the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2} k x^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2
\]
This potential represents a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator with spring constants \( k_x = 4k \) and \( k_y = k \).

The frequencies of the oscillator in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions are:
\[
\omega_x = 2 \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

The energy levels for an anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the sum of the energies in each direction:
\[
E = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Substituting the frequencies \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \):
\[
E = \hbar \cdot 2 \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):
\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2 \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \right]
\]
\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right)
\]

Thus, the energy spectrum is:
\[
\boxed{E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]
where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

eanisotropic case, we can match coefficients. Let me set:

(1/2)m [ω_x² cos²θ + ω_y² sin²θ] =  (1/2 k) [1 + 3 cos²θ]

So, equate terms:

(1/2)m ω_x² cos²θ + (1/2)m ω_y² sin²θ = (1/2 k) (1 + 3 cos²θ)

Multiply both sides by 2:

m ω_x² cos²θ + m ω_y² sin²θ = k (1 + 3 cos²θ)

Arrange the equation:

m ω_x² cos²θ + m ω_y² sin²θ = k + 3k cos²θ

Comparing coefficients of cos²θ and sin²θ:

For cos²θ: m ω_x² = 3k

For sin²θ: m ω_y² = 0? Wait, but sin²θ can't be matched like that unless ω_y = 0, which can't be right. Wait, but the constant term k complicates things. Wait, notice that on the right-hand side, we have k + 3k cos²θ. Let me try to represent k as a term proportional to (cos²θ + sin²θ):

k (cos²θ + sin²θ) + 2k cos²θ = 3k cos²θ + k sin²θ

Wait, that gives 3k cos²θ + k sin²θ. But our potential is k (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2, or am I getting confused here?

Wait, let me get back. Originally, in our potential, after expanding cos²θ, we found:

V(r, θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ)

But perhaps that approach complicated things. Earlier, trying to relate it to the anisotropic oscillator may not be helpful because of the mismatching terms. Let's try again.

Alternatively, perhaps use the original expression: V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) and try to massage it. Let me think in Cartesian coordinates. Since x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so cosθ = x/r, sinθ = y/r. Therefore, cos²θ = x²/r². Therefore, V(r, θ) becomes:

(1/2 kr²)(1 + 3x²/r²) = (1/2 k)(r² + 3x²)

But r² = x² + y², so substituting, we have:

(1/2 k)(x² + y² + 3x²) = (1/2 k)(4x² + y²)

So V(x, y) = (1/2 k)(4x² + y²). Aha! So this potential is actually a anisotropic harmonic oscillator in Cartesian coordinates with different spring constants in the x and y directions.

Wow, that seems more manageable. Why didn't I think of this before? So expressing V in Cartesian coordinates:

V(x, y) = (1/2 k)(4x² + y²) = (1/2)(4k)x² + (1/2)(k)y².

Therefore, this is equivalent to a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator with spring constants k_x = 4k and k_y = k. Thus, the potential can be separated into x and y parts. Therefore, the problem reduces to a 2D harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x = sqrt(k_x/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k_y/m) = sqrt(k/m).

Thus, since the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, the energy levels are simply the sum of the energies from each direction:

E = E_x + E_y = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y + 1/2)

Where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). Plugging in ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ * sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

Therefore:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

However, the standard form of energy levels for an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in 2D is E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2), so that expression is correct.

But let me check my steps again to be sure.

Original potential given as V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ). When converting to Cartesian coordinates:

(1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ) = (1/2k)(x² + y²) + (3/2k)x² = (1/2k x² + 1/2k y²) + 3/2k x² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, seems like I missed a step here. Let me verify:

Original potential: V(r, θ) = 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ.

But r² is x² + y², cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x² / (x² + y²).

Therefore, 3/2 kr² cos²θ = 3/2 k (x² + y²) * (x² / (x² + y²)) = 3/2 k x².

Thus, V(r, θ) = 1/2 k (x² + y²) + 3/2 k x² = 1/2k x² + 1/2k y² + 3/2k x² = (1/2k + 3/2k) x² + 1/2k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, expressed as harmonic oscillators:

V(x, y) = (1/2)(4k) x² + (1/2)(k) y², which corresponds to spring constants k_x = 4k and k_y = k, as I had previously. Therefore, the frequencies are ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). 

Therefore, the energy levels are indeed:

E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2) = 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]

Which gives:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Thus, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers n_x and n_y, which are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).

Alternatively, to express this in terms of the classical frequency ω = sqrt(k/m), as in the standard harmonic oscillator. If we define ω = sqrt(k/m), then ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω. Therefore, we can write:

E = 2ħω(n_x + 1/2) + ħω(n_y + 1/2) = ħω [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] = ħω [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

Alternatively, collecting terms:

E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

However, typically the energy levels are written in terms of the sum of the energies in each direction. But given the form here, the energy is dependent on 2n_x + n_y, which means the levels will have degeneracies. However, the question simply asks for the energy spectrum, which is the set of allowed energy values, so the expression above gives the energy in terms of the quantum numbers n_x and n_y, which are non-negative integers. Thus, each energy level is determined by values of n_x and n_y, leading to distinct energies unless combinations of n_x and n_y give the same value of 2n_x + n_y. 

Therefore, the energy spectrum is E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) where ω = sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y are integers greater than or equal to zero.

Wait, but another way to express this is by defining a new quantum number. For example, let’s set N = 2n_x + n_y, then E = ħω (N + 3/2 ). However, since 2n_x + n_y can take values starting from 0 (when n_x = 0 and n_y = 0) giving N=0, 1 (n_x=0,n_y=1; N=1), 2 (n_x=1,n_y=0; N=2) or (n_x=0,n_y=2; N=2)), etc. So each N corresponds to multiple states, but the energy depends only on N. Wait, no. Wait, N is defined as 2n_x + n_y. So for each N, the possible values of n_x and n_y need to satisfy 2n_x + n_y = N. However, N is not a single quantum number but a combination. Hence, the energy levels for each N have a certain degeneracy, but the energy depends on N, so the spectrum is E_N = ħω (N + 3/2 ) where N = 0, 1, 2, ...

Wait, but let me check with small N:

If N=0: Then 2n_x + n_y =0 ⇒ n_x=0, n_y=0

⇒ E= ħω (0 + 3/2 )= (3/2) ħω

N=1: 2n_x + n_y=1. Solutions: either n_x=0, n_y=1; or n_x=1/2, n_y=0. But n_x must be integer, so only n_x=0, n_y=1. Thus, E= ħω (1 + 3/2 ) = (5/2 ) ħω

N=2: 2n_x +n_y=2.

Possible solutions: n_x=0, n_y=2; n_x=1, n_y=0. Hence, two states here. Energy: (2 + 3/2 ) ħω = 7/2 ħω

N=3: 2n_x +n_y=3. Solutions: n_x=0, n_y=3; n_x=1, n_y=1. So two states. Energy: (3 + 3/2 ) ħω = 9/2 ħω

Wait a minute, so N increases by 1 each time, and the number of states for each N depends on how many pairs (n_x,n_y) satisfy 2n_x +n_y = N. So the energy spectrum is quantized in steps of ħω, starting from (3/2)ħω, with each subsequent energy level differing by ħω. But with varying degeneracy.

Therefore, the general expression for the energy is E = ħω (N + 3/2 ) where N is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...), and for each N, there are floor(N/2)+1 possible states (depending on how many n_x and n_y combinations yield the same N). But perhaps the problem just wants the energy spectrum in terms of the quantum numbers rather than in terms of N. Since in Cartesian coordinates the problem is separable into x and y, specifying n_x and n_y gives unique energy.

But perhaps the question expects the answer in terms of polar coordinates quantum numbers, like n_r and m, but given that in Cartesian coordinates it's straightforward. Let's verify once again.

Alternatively, since the problem is separable in Cartesian coordinates, then the standard solution applies here. Each direction contributes (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x and (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y. As such, the energy would be:

E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2)

Given that ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω (if ω = sqrt(k/m)), then:

E = 2ħω(n_x + 1/2) + ħω(n_y + 1/2) = ħω [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

Thus, the energy spectrum is:

E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Therefore, each combination of n_x and n_y gives rise to a distinct energy level, unless 2n_x + n_y takes the same value for different pairs (n_x,n_y).

Alternatively, if we want to express it in terms of some other quantum numbers, maybe in terms of the total excitation, but since the frequencies are different in x and y directions, the energy levels are not equally spaced in a way that would allow a single quantum number. However, the question just asks for the energy spectrum, so this formula should suffice.

But let's just check the dimensions. ħ√(k/m) has units of energy: since k has units of [mass]/[time]^2, sqrt(k/m) is 1/[time], so ħ times that has units of energy. Correct.

Alternatively, if we wanted to write in terms of original parameters. Let ω = sqrt(k/m), then energy is:

E = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Alternatively, we can factor 3/2 as:

(2n_x + n_y) + 3/2. So that matches.

Hence, the answer is expression in the form with quantum numbers n_x and n_y. But is there a better way? For instance, when converting back to polar coordinates, perhaps you can find a relation, but given that the problem is separable in Cartesian, and energy depends on the sum 2n_x + n_y, it's probably acceptable to leave the answer in terms of n_x and n_y.

Alternatively, the problem could be approached in polar coordinates. Maybe start in polar coordinates and attempt separation of variables. Let me see if that's feasible, just to check.

We had initially written the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates with the potential V(r, θ). After expanding cos²θ, the potential became V(r, θ)= (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ). So maybe try an ansatz ψ(r,θ) = R(r)Θ(θ), as before. Let me attempt that.

So plug into the Schrödinger equation:

[-ħ²/(2m)( (1/r)d/dr(r dR/dr) Θ + (1/r²) R d²Θ/dθ² ) + (5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) R Θ ] = E R Θ

Divide both sides by R Θ:

[-ħ²/(2m)[(1/(R r)) d/dr(r dR/dr) + (1/(Θ r²)) d²Θ/dθ² ] + (5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) ] = E

Multiply through by -2m/ħ²:

[ (1/(R r)) d/dr(r dR/dr) + (1/(Θ r²)) d²Θ/dθ² ] - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) = - (2m/ħ²) E

Rearranged:

(1/R r) d/dr(r dR/dr) + (1/(Θ r²)) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ) + (2m/ħ²) E = 0

Now multiply through by r² to separate variables:

r/R d/dr(r dR/dr) + (1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 k r^4 + 3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) + (2m/ħ²) E r² = 0

Hmm, this is more complicated because of the r^4 terms. Unless we can express this in terms that separates into functions of r and θ. However, terms like r^4 cos2θ mix r and θ.

Alternatively, we can bring some terms to one side. For instance, group terms dependent on θ and r:

Let me rearrange:

r/R d/dr(r dR/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 k r^4 ) + (2m/ħ²) E r² + [ (1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) ] = 0

But even then, the term (3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) still mixes r and θ in the equation. So unless there's a substitution that can decouple them.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding Θ(θ) in terms of eigenfunctions of the angular part that includes the potential term. But given that in the angular part there is a term with cos2θ multiplied by r^4, this complicates because r is a variable. In standard separation of variables, you'd split the equation such that the angular part is an operator depending only on θ, which then becomes an eigenvalue equation. But here, the angular term is multiplied by r^4, so when trying to separate variables, you would need something like:

(1/Θ) d²Θ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²)(3/4 k r^4 cos2θ) = - l(l+1)  (or some constant)

But this constant would involve r^4, which can't be. Thus, maybe separation of variables in polar coordinates isn't feasible here due to the r^4 cos2θ term. 

Therefore, confirms that treating the problem in Cartesian coordinates is the correct approach, as the potential became separable, leading to the energy levels found earlier.

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).

To write this more neatly, we can use the standard frequency of the oscillator ω = sqrt(k/m), then E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ).

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in terms of polar quantum numbers, perhaps n and m, but since it's effectively a 2D anisotropic oscillator in Cartesian coordinates, which doesn't conserve angular momentum (since the potential is not radially symmetric), the good quantum numbers are n_x and n_y.

Hence, the energy levels are as given above, E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where ω = sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, ...

Alternatively, if the problem wants an explicit expression without referring to ω, then:

E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

To confirm this answer, let's check when n_x = n_y = 0, we have E = ħ sqrt(k/m)*(0 + 0 + 3/2 ) = (3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m). This is the ground state energy for this system. The first excited states would be when either n_x=0, n_y=1 or n_x=1, n_y=0. Their energies would be:

For n_x=0, n_y=1: E = ħ sqrt(k/m)*(0 + 1 + 3/2 ) = (5/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)

For n_x=1, n_y=0: E = ħ sqrt(k/m)*(2 + 0 + 3/2 ) = (7/2) ħ sqrt(k/m )

Thus, differing by increments of ħ sqrt(k/m ) for different transitions. This makes sense given the anisotropic potential, leading to different energies for excitations in x and y directions.

Thus, the conclusion is that the energy spectrum is given by E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), for non-negative integers n_x and n_y.


**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is \boxed{E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, match coefficients for cos²θ and sin²θ.\n\nLet me compute: \n\nLet me assume that us having ω₁² and ω₂² in the anisotropic case leads to writing our potential as:\n\n(1/2)k r² [1 + 3cos²θ] = (1/2)k r² [4 cos²θ + sin²θ]\n\nWait, since 4cos²θ + sin²θ = 3cos²θ + (cos²θ + sin²θ) = 3cos²θ + 1. Yes! Therefore, 1 + 3cos²θ = 3cos²θ + 1 = 4cos²θ + sin²θ. No, wait:\n\nWait, 4cos²θ + sin²θ = 3cos²θ + (cos²θ + sin²θ) = 3cos²θ +1. That's correct. So thus:\n\n1 + 3cos²θ = 3cos²θ +1 = 4cos²θ + sin²θ. \n\nTherefore, our potential can be written as:\n\nV(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² (4cos²θ + sin²θ ) = (1/2)k ( (2cosθ)^2 ) r² + (1/2)k (sinθ)^2 r².\n\nBut in Cartesian coordinates, this would be:\n\nV(x,y) = (1/2)k ( (2x)^2 + y^2 )\n\nBecause x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So 4x² + y² = (2x)^2 + y².\n\nTherefore, this is equivalent to an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the x and y directions. One direction has spring constant k_x such that (1/2)k_x x² = (1/2)k (2x)^2 => k_x = 4k. The other direction has k_y = k.\n\nConverting spring constants to frequencies, ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2ω, and similarly ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Here, ω = sqrt(k/m). So then ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω.\n\nHence, the energy levels of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by:\n\nE = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y + 1/2)\n= ħ2ω (n_x +1/2) + ħω (n_y +1/2)\n\nBut since ω = sqrt(k/m), we can write:\n\nE = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y +1/2))\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nBut wait, N_x = 2(n_x +1/2) ?\n\nWait, let's go step by step. For a harmonic oscillator in each direction:\n\nE_x = ħω_x (n_x +1/2) and E_y = ħω_y (n_y +1/2)\n\nSo for our case:\n\nE = E_x + E_y = ħ(2ω)(n_x +1/2) + ħω(n_y +1/2)\n= ħω [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) ]\n= ħω [2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2]\n= ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]\n\nAlternatively, simplifying more neatly:\n\nExpress the total energy in terms of two quantum numbers n_x and n_y, where each can be 0,1,2,...\n\nAlternatively, define two quantum numbers corresponding to each direction; since in the x-direction, the frequency is twice that of the y-direction, which has frequency ω.\n\nBut sometimes, when the frequencies are commensurate (here, ω_x = 2ω_y), there might be additional degeneracy or special structure. However, in this case, ω_x is an integer multiple (2) of ω_y. So let's check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of it in terms of normal modes. Let me just confirm.\n\nSuppose m is the mass, then the potential is V(x,y) = (1/2)k (4x² + y²). Therefore, in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is 4k, so angular frequency ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m). In the y-direction, it's sqrt(k/m) = ω.\n\nThus, energy levels E = ħω_x (n_x +1/2) + ħω (n_y +1/2) = ħ(2ω)(n_x +1/2) + ħω(n_y +1/2) = ħω [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)].\n\nSo simplifying:\n\nE = ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]\n\nBut sqrt(k/m) can also be expressed in another way. Alternatively, if ω is given as sqrt(k/m), then ω = sqrt(k/m).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express in terms of the original variables. The problem gives the potential in terms of V(r,θ) which after conversion links to x and y as (after scaling). Let me see whether this approach is correct.\n\nWait, where exactly was the connection made? The potential in Cartesian coordinates is (1/2)k(4x² + y²). So this is quadratic in x and y, axes-aligned. So that makes it an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x = 2sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Then energy levels would be sums in both directions. So that may answer the question.\n\nBut then since energy is quantified into E_{n_x,n_y} = ħω_x(n_x +1/2) + ħω_y(n_y +1/2). Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, if the potential is V(x,y) = 1/2m ω_x² x² +1/2 m ω_y² y².\n\nComparing to our case, V(x,y)=2k x² + 0.5k y²: Wait, maybe there's a m factor.\n\nWait, earlier equivalence.\n\nOriginal potential after substituting x and y:\n\nV(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr²cos²θ = (1/2)kr²(1 + 3cos²θ)\n\nThen, converting to Cartesian coordinates:\n\nSince r² = x² + y², cosθ = x/r.\n\nSo,\n\nV(x,y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².\n\nWait, if I expand that:\n\nV(x,y) = (1/2k x² + 1/2k y²) + (3/2k x² ) = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k )x² + (1/2k)y² = 2k x² + (1/2k)y².\n\nSo in terms of m and ω, such that the potential terms can be written as (1/2)m ω_x² x² + (1/2)m ω_y² y², so equate with 2k x² + (1/2 k)y²:\n\nSet (1/2) m ω_x² x² = 2k x² ⇒ (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k ⇒ ω_x² = 4k/m ⇒ ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)\n\nSimilarly, (1/2)m ω_y² y² = (1/2k) y² ⇒ (1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2 k) ⇒ ω_y² = k/m ⇒ ω_y = sqrt(k/m)\n\nGood, that part checks out.\n\nThus, as before, we have energies:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y +1/2) = 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x +1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y +1/2 )\n\nFactor out ħ sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) ]\n\nMultiply through:\n\n= ħ*sqrt(k/m) [2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ] \n= ħ*sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nNow, m is the mass, and usually, for the quantum harmonic oscillator, we have ω = sqrt(k/m)].\n\nSo using that substitution, we can write E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). However, we need to confirm that both n_x and n_y are non-negative integers.\n\nAlternatively, depending on how the original problem chooses quantum numbers, maybe we need to express it in terms of other parameters.\n\nBut in 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillators, if the frequencies are not commensurate, the energy levels are non-degenerate unless there's a specific ratio, but here since ω_x / ω_y = 2, which is a rational number, we might have the energy levels becoming the same for combinations where 2n_x + n_y is a constant.\n\nAlternatively, since the energy depends on the combination 2n_x + n_y, different pairs (n_x, n_y) that give the same 2n_x + n_y will have the same energy. So for example, for 2n_x +n_y = N where N is a non-negative integer, then E = ħω( N + 3/2 ).\n\nBut each energy level E corresponds to all pairs (n_x, n_y) such that 2n_x +n_y = N. So the number of states with energy E_N is the number of non-negative integers n_x, n_y where n_y = N - 2n_x, hence n_x can range from 0 to floor(N/2). So the degeneracy would be floor(N/2) +1. But the question just asks for the energy spectrum, not the degeneracy.\n\nHowever, in order to express the energy spectrum, perhaps it's better to write E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). So the energy levels can be indexed by two integers n_x and n_y, each ≥0.\n\nAlternatively, if possible, we can make a substitution to use a different pair of quantum numbers, maybe similar to the radial quantum number in polar coordinates. However, since the current separation led us to Cartesian coordinates and we figured out the energy levels accordingly. Let me check whether the problem statement imposes any constraints.\n\nThe problem states the particle is moving in two dimensions. Since I was successful in converting the given potential into Cartesian coordinates as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, that approach gives us energy levels expressed as above.\n\nBut does this address the original coordinates? Possibly. Alternatively, perhaps there is a different quantization in polar coordinates. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we write the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates using separation of variables, despite the angular dependence. Let me return to the equation:\n\nOriginal potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr²) cos²θ.\n\nWriting the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m) [ (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r ψ) + (1/r²) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ] ) + [ (1/2kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ) ] ψ = E ψ.\n\nAssume ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Φ(θ). Then substitute into the equation:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m) [ (1/r)(d/dr (r dR/dr)) Φ + (R/r²) d²Φ/dθ² ] ) + [ (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ) ] R Φ = E R Φ\n\nDivide both sides by R Φ and multiply by -2m/ħ²:\n\n[ (1/R)(1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² ) ] - (2m/ħ²)[ (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ) - E ] = 0\n\nArrange terms:\n\n(1/r R) d/dr (r dR/dr) - (2m/(ħ²)) (1/2 kr²) R - (2m/(ħ²))(3/2 kr² cos²θ) R + (1/(r² Φ) d²Φ/dθ² ) + (2m/(ħ²)) E = 0\n\nWait, the separation seems tricky here as terms involve a mix of r and θ. For example, the term - (2m/(ħ²))(3/2 k r² cos²θ ) R still couples r and θ. So maybe we need to adjust the separation.\n\nAlternatively, move the terms with θ dependence to the angular part:\n\nBring terms dependent on θ to one side:\n\n(1/(r² Φ) d²Φ/dθ² ) - (2m/(ħ²) (3/2 k r² cos²θ ) ) + ... ? Hmm.\n\nIsolate terms involving Φ(θ) and dependent on θ:\n\nFrom above:\n\nLeft-hand side after division would be:\n\n(1/r R) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Φ) d²Φ/dθ² ) - (2m/ħ²)[ (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ ) - E ] = 0\n\nMultiply through by r²:\n\nr/R d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/Φ) d²Φ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²) r² [ (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ ) - E ] = 0\n\nThen,\n\nr d/dr (r dR/dr)/R + d²Φ/dθ²/Φ - (2m/ħ²) r² [ (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ ) - E ] =0\n\nThis doesn't neatly separate. However, if I can factor out terms as a function of r times a function of θ, then perhaps the equation can be split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express the potential in terms of spherical harmonics or another angular basis. The presence of cos²θ suggests an expansion in terms of angular momentum eigenstates, since cos²θ relates to l=2 components.\n\nRecall that in 2D polar coordinates, the angular solutions are typically e^(i m θ) with m integer. But here, the potential has a cos²θ term. Let's express cos²θ in terms of angular functions:\n\nWe can use trigonometric identities. We know that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2.\n\nTherefore, the potential term with angular dependence is (3/2) kr² * cos²θ = (3/4)kr²(1 + cos2θ)\n\nThus, total potential:\n\nV(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/4 kr²)(1 + cos2θ ) = [1/2 + 3/4]kr² + (3/4 kr² cos2θ )\n\nSo:\n\nV(r,θ) = 5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ\n\nSplit the equation into radial and angular parts. Let's write the Schrödinger equation again with this expression for V:\n\n- (ħ²/(2m) [ (1/r) ∂/∂r(r ∂ψ/∂r ) + (1/r²) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ] ) + [ 5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ ] ψ = Eψ\n\nSeparate ψ(r,θ) = R(r)Φ(θ):\n\nMultiply through by -2m/ħ²:\n\n(1/r d/dr(r dR/dr)) Φ/R + (1/r²) Φ''/Φ - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ - E ) = 0\n\nBut since this is in terms of r and θ, we can attempt to rewrite terms so that we can separate variables. Let me attempt to bring the angular part to one side.\n\nLet’s first consider:\n\nThe equation after separating:\n\n( (1/r)( (R')' + R'/r ) ) Φ + (1/r²) R Φ'' - (2m/ħ²)( (5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ ) - E ) R Φ =0\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's start again.\n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\n(1/r R d/dr(r dR/dr) ) + (1/r² Φ d²Φ/dθ² ) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ - E ) =0\n\nMultiply through by r²:\n\n(r/R) d/dr(r dR/dr) + (1/Φ) d²Φ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²) r² (5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ - E ) =0\n\nPlan: Group terms involving θ, and terms involving r. Let's notice that the term with cos2θ is still angular but multiplied by r^4. This complicates things. In normal separation, the potential term must depend on r and theta such that it can be written as a sum of terms each depending only on r or theta, which is not the case here. Hence, the potential couples r and theta, making standard separation impossible unless perhaps a substitution is made.\n\nAlternatively, what if we consider Q = r² cos2θ, then potential terms are in terms of r^2 and Q.\n\nBut unless there exists an operator that separates, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, go back to Cartesian coordinates. Since we saw that the potential can be written as V(x,y)=2k x^2 + (1/2)k y^2, which gives anisotropic oscillator, which is separable in x and y coordinates. Then the energy levels are their product states.\n\nHence, using the Cartesian solution seems more straightforward. The original problem has coordinates in polar but potential can be rewritten in Cartesian as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Thus, energy levels can be expressed in terms of quantum numbers n_x and n_y, oscillating in x and y directions with different frequencies. Since in x-direction the frequency is twice that of y.\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum E is given by E = ħω_x (n_x +1/2) + ħω_y (n_y +1/2) where ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Therefore,\n\nE = ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m) (n_x +1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y +1/2)\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)]\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )\n\nWhich is as before.\n\nThus, the energy levels are quantized and each level is determined by non-negative integers n_x and n_y, but due to the coefficients (2 and 1 in front of n_x andn_y), the energy levels are not degenerate in the same way as the isotropic case. However, different combinations may yield the same total value.\n\nSince the problem asks for the energy spectrum, the possible energy levels are:\n\nE_{n_x,n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x, n_y =0,1,2,...\n\nAlternatively, if m and others want to use standard oscillator frequencies, recall that in an isotropic 2D oscillator with frequency ω, quantum numbers n_r and m (angular momentum) lead to Energies E = ħω (2n_r + |m| +1 ). But here, given the anisotropy, the correspondence may differ. But due to the angular term in potential, which leads to the anisotropic oscillator, the Cartesian separation is preferred here.\n\nAnother way to see things: energy eigenstates are also eigenstates of number operators N_x and N_y with eigenvalues n_x and n_y. So yes, the formula E_{n_x,n_y} as above is correct.\n\nThus, the answer would be listing the energy levels as E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) or writing it in terms of combinations n = 2n_x + n_y, but n is not a single quantum number; it's parameterized by two integers. For instance, for each n, you can choose different pairs n_x and n_y such that 2n_x +n_y = N - 3/2 ? Not quite. Wait, no.\n\nBetter to keep n_x and n_y independent and the total energy is linear in these integers.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, it just asks for the energy spectrum. Therefore, the possible energies are given by all numbers of the form:\n\nE = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x, n_y are non-negative integers and ω=sqrt(k/m).\n\nAlternatively, write this as proportional to (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), scaled by ħω. Different ordered pairs (n_x, n_y) give different energies unless 2n_x +n_y are the same.\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum consists of energies:\n\nE_N = ħω (N + 3/2 ), where N can be any non-negative integer that can be written as N = 2n_x +n_y for n_x,n_y ≥0.\n\n\nWait! Let me check for possible N's. For example:\n\nn_x=0, n_y=0: N=0 → E = (3/2) ħω\n\nn_x=0, n_y=1: N=1 → E=(5/2) ħω\n\nn_x=1, n_y=0: N=2→ E= (2 + 3/2 )ħω= (7/2) ħω\n\nn_x=0, n_y=2: N=2→ E= (5/2 +1) ħω= (Wait no) Wait, no, if N=2n_x +n_y, then for n_x=0, n_y=2 gives N=2, and n_x=1,n_y=0 also gives N=2. Similarly, n_x=0,n_y=1→ N=1; n_x=1,n_y=1→N=3.\n\nBut this seems similar to (0,0) gives N=0, etc. However, in the energy expression we had E= ħω (N + 3/2), where N=2n_x +n_y. Wait, original expression:\n\nE= ħω (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )\n\nThus, defining a new quantum number, perhaps M = 2n_x +n_y, so that E= ħω(M +3/2 ), where M= 2n_x +n_y. However, M is an integer greater than or equal to zero? Let's see, since n_x,n_y are non-negative integers, 2n_x +n_y >=0. Yes. For example:\n\n- When n_x=0, n_y=0: M=0 → E=(3/2) ħω\n\n- n_x=0, n_y=1: M=1 →\n E=(1 + 3/2) ħω=5/2 ħω\n\n- n_x=1, n_y=0: M=2→2 +3/2 =7/2\n\n- n_x=0, n_y=2: M=2→ et cetera.\n\nBut different combinations of n_x and n_y can lead to the same M. Therefore, the energy levels can be labeled by M which is any non-negative integer, and each energy level has a degeneracy equal to the number of pairs (n_x,n_y) such that M=2n_x +n_y.\n\nHence, in this form, the energy spectrum is E= ħ sqrt(k/m) (M + 3/2 ), where M=0,1,2,... However, while mathematical, this is different from the usual harmonic oscillator which has equidistant levels. Here, depending on M, levels might not be equally spaced. Let me verify:\n\nIf M=0, E0=(3/2)ħω\n\nM=1, E1=(5/2)ħω, difference = ħω\n\nM=2, Enext= (7/2)ħω, difference same.\n\nWait, M=2's next?\n\nWait:\n\nE for M=0: 3/2 ωħ\n\nM=1: 5/2\n\nM=2: 7/2\n\nM=3: 9/2\n\nEtc. Therefore, the difference between consecutive levels is ΔE= ħω each step. Therefore, the energy levels are equally spaced with spacing ħω, starting from 3/2 ħω. Thus, the spectrum is equidistant.\n\nThe possible values of M are constrained by non-negative integers; but for each step M, you can reach the next by incrementing by 1, but physically does that correspond?\n\nLet me see:\n\nEach M is 2n_x +n_y where n_x,n_y -> 0,1,2,...\n\nTherefore, possible values of M:\n\nn such that M can take all integers greater or equal to zero. For future, for any integer M ≥0, exists n_x, n_y such that M =2n_x +n_y. Because:\n\nTake n_x= floor(M/2), then n_y=M-2n_x. Since 2n_x<=M <2(n_x +1 ), M-2n_x is either 0 or1. Wait, no. If n_x is floor(M/2), then:\n\nIf M even: M=2n_x ⇒n_x=M/2, n_y=0\n\nIf M odd: M=2n_x +1, with n_x= (M-1)/2 ⇒n_y=1.\n\nWait, but in any case, for example:\n\nIf M=0 ⇒ (0,0)\n\nM=1 ⇒(0,1)\n\nM=2⇒(1,0) or (0,2). Wait, but in the energy expression n_x andn_yare non-negative integers. Wait, we said M=2n_x +n_y. Thus, for M=2:\n\nn_x can be 0, then n_y=2; or n_x=1, then n_y=0. So there are two possibilities. Hence, the degeneracy is determined by number of pairs (n_x,n_y). However, as per energy expression E= ħω (M +3/2 ), same for all pairs leading to the same M.\n\nHowever, each M is attainable, hence for each non-negative integerM, the energy levels are E= ħ sqrt(k/m) ( M + 3/2 ), with M=0,1,2,...\n\nBut wait in the initial cases:\n\nFor M=0: 3/2\n\nM=1: 5/2 (difference 1)\n\nM=2:7/2 (difference 1)\n\nSo they're spaced by ħω, but the original problem is not isotropic, yet this approach seems to give equally spaced energy levels, similar to a 1D harmonic oscillator, but with some multiplicative factor. Wait, that's interesting. Alternatively, if it's really correct.\n\nWait a second, if it was a normal 2D isotropic oscillator, the energy would be E= ħω(n_x +n_y +1 ), degenerate for each (n_x,n_y) such that n_x +n_y is constant.Thus, spacing between each N (where N= n_x +n_y) is ħω. In the case here, it's similar in that for M= 2n_x +n_y, incremental M by 1 also yields incremented E by ħω. So seems analogous but with some changes in the composition.\n\nTherefore, for the given problem, the energy levels are the same as those of a 1D harmonic oscillator with frequency ω multiplied by (M + 3/2 ), with M=0,1,2,..., and since ω= sqrt(k/m), then E= (M + 3/2 ) ħ sqrt(k/m). And each M corresponds to solutions (n_x, n_y) as outlined.\n\nHence, the the energy spectrum is equally spaced, similar to 1D HO but starting from (3/2)ħω.\n\nTo confirm consistency, let's check some states.\n\nFor the lowest energy level, M=0: (n_x,n_y)= (0,0). E=(0 +0 +3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. In the anisotropic oscillator, n_x=0 andn_y=0: hence E= 2*(0 +1/2) ħω_x + (0 +1/2) ħω_y ): but wait, since ω_x=2ω, ω_y=ω:\n\nE= 2*(1/2)*2ω ħ +1/2 *ω ħ= (2*( + we wait, no.\n\nWait sorry: no. If in each of the directions x and y: E_x= _= (n_x +1/2) ħω_x. Similarly for E_y.\n\nFor n_x=0, E_x= (1/2) ħω_x. Similarly, E_y= (1/2) ħω_y.\n\nThus, E= (1/2) ħω_x + (1/2) ħω_y = (1/2 ħ )( ω_x + ω_y )\n\nIn our case, since ω_x= 2ω, ω_y=ω,\n\nE= (1/2) (2ω + ω ) ħ= (3/2 ω ) ħ.\n\nCorrect.\n\nForM=0, which is n_x=0,n_y=0, gives E=(3/2)ħ ω.\n\nM=1:\n\nEither n_x=0, n_y=1: E_parallel= 2*(0 +1/2)ħω_x + (1 +1/2)ħω_y\n\n= 2*(1/2)*(2ω)ħ + (3/2)*ω ħ= (2ω ħ)(1/2 *2) + (3/2) ω ħ= 2ω*1/2*2 = 2 ω (Wait, perhaps I should compute it again):\n\nWait,\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = (n_x +1/2) ħω_x + (n_y +1/2)ħω_y.\n\nFor n_x=0, n_y=1:\n\nE= (0 +1/2) * 2ω ħ + (1 +1/2)ω ħ= (1 ω ħ ) + ( 3/2 ω ħ )= (1 +1.5) ħω =.2.5 ħω=5/2 ħ ω.\nFor [M=1:] Yes.\n\nAlternatively, as per the formula E=(2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ) ħω= (2*0 +1 + 3/2 )=  (1 +3/2 )=(5/2)2.5. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, for a different pair, say n_x=1, n_y=0:\n\nE=(2(1) +0 +3/2 ) ħω= (2 +3/2 )=7/2. So their energy is 7/2 ħω.\n\nBut what's this corresponds to the anisotropic calculation:\n\nn_x=1, n_y=0,\n\nE= (1 +1/2) *2ω ħ + (0 +1/2)*ω ħ = (3/2 *2 ω ħ ) + (1/2 *ω ħ )= 3 ω ħ + 0.5 ω ħ =3.5 ω ħ =7/2 ω ħ, correct.\n\nThus, confirming the formula. Therefore, the energy spectrum is indeed given by:\n\nE= ħω ( 2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )\n\nOr simply E= ħω ( M +3/2 ),where M=0,1,2,..., each representing different combinations of n_x andn_y meeting 2n_x +n_y =M.\n\nBut the problem asks to 'Find the energy spectrum.', so listing quantized energies in terms of quantum numbers. Depending on interpretation, it should be expressed as above. Various possibilities acceptable but the most precise is in terms of distinct energies with corresponding quantum numbers.\n\nAlternatively, providing the expression in terms of variables given noting the relationship:\n\nRecall that ω = sqrt(k/m), thus E= ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ) for non-negative integers n_x and n_y.\n\nTherefore, with that, the answer is { E_n = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ) | n_x, n_y ∈ ℕ ∪{0} }.\n\nHowever, perhaps, the problem might accept the form in terms of (quantum numbers using angular momentum.), but according to our analysis separated into x and y oscillators and energy levels accordingly.\n\nThus, the energy spectrum is — the energies are given by ħ sqrt(k/m) times (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x andn_y are non-negative integers. Alternatively, in other terms, this can be written in terms of a potential that corresponds to a combination of stretches in x and y directions, leading to the given spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is as above.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy spectrum is given by \\boxed{E = \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\left(2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)} where \\(n_x\\) and \\(n_y\\) are non-negative integers.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744976196, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8030, prompt_tokens=958, total_tokens=8988, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle moving in two dimensions with the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

First, we rewrite the potential using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2} \):

\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 \left(1 + 3\cos^2(\theta)\right) = \frac{5}{4} kr^2 + \frac{3}{4} kr^2 \cos(2\theta)
\]

Recognizing the angular dependence, we reframe the problem by converting to Cartesian coordinates. The potential can be expressed as:

\[
V(x, y) = 2k x^2 + \frac{1}{2} k y^2
\]

This represents an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions. The corresponding angular frequencies are:

\[
\omega_x = 2 \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

The energy levels for an anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Substituting the frequencies \(\omega_x\) and \(\omega_y\):

\[
E = \hbar \cdot 2 \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Factoring out \(\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\):

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right]
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the brackets:

\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)
\]

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by:

\[
\boxed{E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]

where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Let's see:

From our potential:
V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² (1 + 3cos²θ) )
        = (1/2)kr² [ (3cos²θ + sin²θ) + sin²θ )? Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, match coefficients for cos²θ and sin²θ.

Let me compute: 

Let me assume that us having ω₁² and ω₂² in the anisotropic case leads to writing our potential as:

(1/2)k r² [1 + 3cos²θ] = (1/2)k r² [4 cos²θ + sin²θ]

Wait, since 4cos²θ + sin²θ = 3cos²θ + (cos²θ + sin²θ) = 3cos²θ + 1. Yes! Therefore, 1 + 3cos²θ = 3cos²θ + 1 = 4cos²θ + sin²θ. No, wait:

Wait, 4cos²θ + sin²θ = 3cos²θ + (cos²θ + sin²θ) = 3cos²θ +1. That's correct. So thus:

1 + 3cos²θ = 3cos²θ +1 = 4cos²θ + sin²θ. 

Therefore, our potential can be written as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² (4cos²θ + sin²θ ) = (1/2)k ( (2cosθ)^2 ) r² + (1/2)k (sinθ)^2 r².

But in Cartesian coordinates, this would be:

V(x,y) = (1/2)k ( (2x)^2 + y^2 )

Because x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So 4x² + y² = (2x)^2 + y².

Therefore, this is equivalent to an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the x and y directions. One direction has spring constant k_x such that (1/2)k_x x² = (1/2)k (2x)^2 => k_x = 4k. The other direction has k_y = k.

Converting spring constants to frequencies, ω_x = sqrt(k_x / m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2ω, and similarly ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Here, ω = sqrt(k/m). So then ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω.

Hence, the energy levels of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by:

E = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y + 1/2)
= ħ2ω (n_x +1/2) + ħω (n_y +1/2)

But since ω = sqrt(k/m), we can write:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y +1/2))
= ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But wait, N_x = 2(n_x +1/2) ?

Wait, let's go step by step. For a harmonic oscillator in each direction:

E_x = ħω_x (n_x +1/2) and E_y = ħω_y (n_y +1/2)

So for our case:

E = E_x + E_y = ħ(2ω)(n_x +1/2) + ħω(n_y +1/2)
= ħω [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) ]
= ħω [2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2]
= ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Alternatively, simplifying more neatly:

Express the total energy in terms of two quantum numbers n_x and n_y, where each can be 0,1,2,...

Alternatively, define two quantum numbers corresponding to each direction; since in the x-direction, the frequency is twice that of the y-direction, which has frequency ω.

But sometimes, when the frequencies are commensurate (here, ω_x = 2ω_y), there might be additional degeneracy or special structure. However, in this case, ω_x is an integer multiple (2) of ω_y. So let's check.

Alternatively, perhaps think of it in terms of normal modes. Let me just confirm.

Suppose m is the mass, then the potential is V(x,y) = (1/2)k (4x² + y²). Therefore, in the x-direction, the effective spring constant is 4k, so angular frequency ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2*sqrt(k/m). In the y-direction, it's sqrt(k/m) = ω.

Thus, energy levels E = ħω_x (n_x +1/2) + ħω (n_y +1/2) = ħ(2ω)(n_x +1/2) + ħω(n_y +1/2) = ħω [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)].

So simplifying:

E = ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

But sqrt(k/m) can also be expressed in another way. Alternatively, if ω is given as sqrt(k/m), then ω = sqrt(k/m).

Alternatively, perhaps we can express in terms of the original variables. The problem gives the potential in terms of V(r,θ) which after conversion links to x and y as (after scaling). Let me see whether this approach is correct.

Wait, where exactly was the connection made? The potential in Cartesian coordinates is (1/2)k(4x² + y²). So this is quadratic in x and y, axes-aligned. So that makes it an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x = 2sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Then energy levels would be sums in both directions. So that may answer the question.

But then since energy is quantified into E_{n_x,n_y} = ħω_x(n_x +1/2) + ħω_y(n_y +1/2). Let me confirm.

Alternatively, if the potential is V(x,y) = 1/2m ω_x² x² +1/2 m ω_y² y².

Comparing to our case, V(x,y)=2k x² + 0.5k y²: Wait, maybe there's a m factor.

Wait, earlier equivalence.

Original potential after substituting x and y:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr²cos²θ = (1/2)kr²(1 + 3cos²θ)

Then, converting to Cartesian coordinates:

Since r² = x² + y², cosθ = x/r.

So,

V(x,y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Wait, if I expand that:

V(x,y) = (1/2k x² + 1/2k y²) + (3/2k x² ) = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k )x² + (1/2k)y² = 2k x² + (1/2k)y².

So in terms of m and ω, such that the potential terms can be written as (1/2)m ω_x² x² + (1/2)m ω_y² y², so equate with 2k x² + (1/2 k)y²:

Set (1/2) m ω_x² x² = 2k x² ⇒ (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k ⇒ ω_x² = 4k/m ⇒ ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m)

Similarly, (1/2)m ω_y² y² = (1/2k) y² ⇒ (1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2 k) ⇒ ω_y² = k/m ⇒ ω_y = sqrt(k/m)

Good, that part checks out.

Thus, as before, we have energies:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y +1/2) = 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x +1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y +1/2 )

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) ]

Multiply through:

= ħ*sqrt(k/m) [2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ] 
= ħ*sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Now, m is the mass, and usually, for the quantum harmonic oscillator, we have ω = sqrt(k/m)].

So using that substitution, we can write E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). However, we need to confirm that both n_x and n_y are non-negative integers.

Alternatively, depending on how the original problem chooses quantum numbers, maybe we need to express it in terms of other parameters.

But in 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillators, if the frequencies are not commensurate, the energy levels are non-degenerate unless there's a specific ratio, but here since ω_x / ω_y = 2, which is a rational number, we might have the energy levels becoming the same for combinations where 2n_x + n_y is a constant.

Alternatively, since the energy depends on the combination 2n_x + n_y, different pairs (n_x, n_y) that give the same 2n_x + n_y will have the same energy. So for example, for 2n_x +n_y = N where N is a non-negative integer, then E = ħω( N + 3/2 ).

But each energy level E corresponds to all pairs (n_x, n_y) such that 2n_x +n_y = N. So the number of states with energy E_N is the number of non-negative integers n_x, n_y where n_y = N - 2n_x, hence n_x can range from 0 to floor(N/2). So the degeneracy would be floor(N/2) +1. But the question just asks for the energy spectrum, not the degeneracy.

However, in order to express the energy spectrum, perhaps it's better to write E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). So the energy levels can be indexed by two integers n_x and n_y, each ≥0.

Alternatively, if possible, we can make a substitution to use a different pair of quantum numbers, maybe similar to the radial quantum number in polar coordinates. However, since the current separation led us to Cartesian coordinates and we figured out the energy levels accordingly. Let me check whether the problem statement imposes any constraints.

The problem states the particle is moving in two dimensions. Since I was successful in converting the given potential into Cartesian coordinates as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, that approach gives us energy levels expressed as above.

But does this address the original coordinates? Possibly. Alternatively, perhaps there is a different quantization in polar coordinates. Let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we write the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates using separation of variables, despite the angular dependence. Let me return to the equation:

Original potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr²) cos²θ.

Writing the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates:

- (ħ²/(2m) [ (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r ψ) + (1/r²) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ] ) + [ (1/2kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ) ] ψ = E ψ.

Assume ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Φ(θ). Then substitute into the equation:

- (ħ²/(2m) [ (1/r)(d/dr (r dR/dr)) Φ + (R/r²) d²Φ/dθ² ] ) + [ (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ) ] R Φ = E R Φ

Divide both sides by R Φ and multiply by -2m/ħ²:

[ (1/R)(1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² ) ] - (2m/ħ²)[ (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ) - E ] = 0

Arrange terms:

(1/r R) d/dr (r dR/dr) - (2m/(ħ²)) (1/2 kr²) R - (2m/(ħ²))(3/2 kr² cos²θ) R + (1/(r² Φ) d²Φ/dθ² ) + (2m/(ħ²)) E = 0

Wait, the separation seems tricky here as terms involve a mix of r and θ. For example, the term - (2m/(ħ²))(3/2 k r² cos²θ ) R still couples r and θ. So maybe we need to adjust the separation.

Alternatively, move the terms with θ dependence to the angular part:

Bring terms dependent on θ to one side:

(1/(r² Φ) d²Φ/dθ² ) - (2m/(ħ²) (3/2 k r² cos²θ ) ) + ... ? Hmm.

Isolate terms involving Φ(θ) and dependent on θ:

From above:

Left-hand side after division would be:

(1/r R) d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Φ) d²Φ/dθ² ) - (2m/ħ²)[ (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ ) - E ] = 0

Multiply through by r²:

r/R d/dr (r dR/dr) + (1/Φ) d²Φ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²) r² [ (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ ) - E ] = 0

Then,

r d/dr (r dR/dr)/R + d²Φ/dθ²/Φ - (2m/ħ²) r² [ (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ ) - E ] =0

This doesn't neatly separate. However, if I can factor out terms as a function of r times a function of θ, then perhaps the equation can be split.

Alternatively, maybe express the potential in terms of spherical harmonics or another angular basis. The presence of cos²θ suggests an expansion in terms of angular momentum eigenstates, since cos²θ relates to l=2 components.

Recall that in 2D polar coordinates, the angular solutions are typically e^(i m θ) with m integer. But here, the potential has a cos²θ term. Let's express cos²θ in terms of angular functions:

We can use trigonometric identities. We know that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Therefore, the potential term with angular dependence is (3/2) kr² * cos²θ = (3/4)kr²(1 + cos2θ)

Thus, total potential:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/4 kr²)(1 + cos2θ ) = [1/2 + 3/4]kr² + (3/4 kr² cos2θ )

So:

V(r,θ) = 5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ

Split the equation into radial and angular parts. Let's write the Schrödinger equation again with this expression for V:

- (ħ²/(2m) [ (1/r) ∂/∂r(r ∂ψ/∂r ) + (1/r²) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ] ) + [ 5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ ] ψ = Eψ

Separate ψ(r,θ) = R(r)Φ(θ):

Multiply through by -2m/ħ²:

(1/r d/dr(r dR/dr)) Φ/R + (1/r²) Φ''/Φ - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ - E ) = 0

But since this is in terms of r and θ, we can attempt to rewrite terms so that we can separate variables. Let me attempt to bring the angular part to one side.

Let’s first consider:

The equation after separating:

( (1/r)( (R')' + R'/r ) ) Φ + (1/r²) R Φ'' - (2m/ħ²)( (5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ ) - E ) R Φ =0

Wait, maybe not. Let's start again.

Original equation after substitution:

(1/r R d/dr(r dR/dr) ) + (1/r² Φ d²Φ/dθ² ) - (2m/ħ²)(5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ - E ) =0

Multiply through by r²:

(r/R) d/dr(r dR/dr) + (1/Φ) d²Φ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²) r² (5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ - E ) =0

Plan: Group terms involving θ, and terms involving r. Let's notice that the term with cos2θ is still angular but multiplied by r^4. This complicates things. In normal separation, the potential term must depend on r and theta such that it can be written as a sum of terms each depending only on r or theta, which is not the case here. Hence, the potential couples r and theta, making standard separation impossible unless perhaps a substitution is made.

Alternatively, what if we consider Q = r² cos2θ, then potential terms are in terms of r^2 and Q.

But unless there exists an operator that separates, maybe not.

Alternatively, go back to Cartesian coordinates. Since we saw that the potential can be written as V(x,y)=2k x^2 + (1/2)k y^2, which gives anisotropic oscillator, which is separable in x and y coordinates. Then the energy levels are their product states.

Hence, using the Cartesian solution seems more straightforward. The original problem has coordinates in polar but potential can be rewritten in Cartesian as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Thus, energy levels can be expressed in terms of quantum numbers n_x and n_y, oscillating in x and y directions with different frequencies. Since in x-direction the frequency is twice that of y.

Therefore, the energy spectrum E is given by E = ħω_x (n_x +1/2) + ħω_y (n_y +1/2) where ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Therefore,

E = ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m) (n_x +1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y +1/2)
= ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)]
= ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )

Which is as before.

Thus, the energy levels are quantized and each level is determined by non-negative integers n_x and n_y, but due to the coefficients (2 and 1 in front of n_x andn_y), the energy levels are not degenerate in the same way as the isotropic case. However, different combinations may yield the same total value.

Since the problem asks for the energy spectrum, the possible energy levels are:

E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x, n_y =0,1,2,...

Alternatively, if m and others want to use standard oscillator frequencies, recall that in an isotropic 2D oscillator with frequency ω, quantum numbers n_r and m (angular momentum) lead to Energies E = ħω (2n_r + |m| +1 ). But here, given the anisotropy, the correspondence may differ. But due to the angular term in potential, which leads to the anisotropic oscillator, the Cartesian separation is preferred here.

Another way to see things: energy eigenstates are also eigenstates of number operators N_x and N_y with eigenvalues n_x and n_y. So yes, the formula E_{n_x,n_y} as above is correct.

Thus, the answer would be listing the energy levels as E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) or writing it in terms of combinations n = 2n_x + n_y, but n is not a single quantum number; it's parameterized by two integers. For instance, for each n, you can choose different pairs n_x and n_y such that 2n_x +n_y = N - 3/2 ? Not quite. Wait, no.

Better to keep n_x and n_y independent and the total energy is linear in these integers.

But based on the problem statement, it just asks for the energy spectrum. Therefore, the possible energies are given by all numbers of the form:

E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x, n_y are non-negative integers and ω=sqrt(k/m).

Alternatively, write this as proportional to (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), scaled by ħω. Different ordered pairs (n_x, n_y) give different energies unless 2n_x +n_y are the same.

Therefore, the energy spectrum consists of energies:

E_N = ħω (N + 3/2 ), where N can be any non-negative integer that can be written as N = 2n_x +n_y for n_x,n_y ≥0.


Wait! Let me check for possible N's. For example:

n_x=0, n_y=0: N=0 → E = (3/2) ħω

n_x=0, n_y=1: N=1 → E=(5/2) ħω

n_x=1, n_y=0: N=2→ E= (2 + 3/2 )ħω= (7/2) ħω

n_x=0, n_y=2: N=2→ E= (5/2 +1) ħω= (Wait no) Wait, no, if N=2n_x +n_y, then for n_x=0, n_y=2 gives N=2, and n_x=1,n_y=0 also gives N=2. Similarly, n_x=0,n_y=1→ N=1; n_x=1,n_y=1→N=3.

But this seems similar to (0,0) gives N=0, etc. However, in the energy expression we had E= ħω (N + 3/2), where N=2n_x +n_y. Wait, original expression:

E= ħω (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )

Thus, defining a new quantum number, perhaps M = 2n_x +n_y, so that E= ħω(M +3/2 ), where M= 2n_x +n_y. However, M is an integer greater than or equal to zero? Let's see, since n_x,n_y are non-negative integers, 2n_x +n_y >=0. Yes. For example:

- When n_x=0, n_y=0: M=0 → E=(3/2) ħω

- n_x=0, n_y=1: M=1 →
 E=(1 + 3/2) ħω=5/2 ħω

- n_x=1, n_y=0: M=2→2 +3/2 =7/2

- n_x=0, n_y=2: M=2→ et cetera.

But different combinations of n_x and n_y can lead to the same M. Therefore, the energy levels can be labeled by M which is any non-negative integer, and each energy level has a degeneracy equal to the number of pairs (n_x,n_y) such that M=2n_x +n_y.

Hence, in this form, the energy spectrum is E= ħ sqrt(k/m) (M + 3/2 ), where M=0,1,2,... However, while mathematical, this is different from the usual harmonic oscillator which has equidistant levels. Here, depending on M, levels might not be equally spaced. Let me verify:

If M=0, E0=(3/2)ħω

M=1, E1=(5/2)ħω, difference = ħω

M=2, Enext= (7/2)ħω, difference same.

Wait, M=2's next?

Wait:

E for M=0: 3/2 ωħ

M=1: 5/2

M=2: 7/2

M=3: 9/2

Etc. Therefore, the difference between consecutive levels is ΔE= ħω each step. Therefore, the energy levels are equally spaced with spacing ħω, starting from 3/2 ħω. Thus, the spectrum is equidistant.

The possible values of M are constrained by non-negative integers; but for each step M, you can reach the next by incrementing by 1, but physically does that correspond?

Let me see:

Each M is 2n_x +n_y where n_x,n_y -> 0,1,2,...

Therefore, possible values of M:

n such that M can take all integers greater or equal to zero. For future, for any integer M ≥0, exists n_x, n_y such that M =2n_x +n_y. Because:

Take n_x= floor(M/2), then n_y=M-2n_x. Since 2n_x<=M <2(n_x +1 ), M-2n_x is either 0 or1. Wait, no. If n_x is floor(M/2), then:

If M even: M=2n_x ⇒n_x=M/2, n_y=0

If M odd: M=2n_x +1, with n_x= (M-1)/2 ⇒n_y=1.

Wait, but in any case, for example:

If M=0 ⇒ (0,0)

M=1 ⇒(0,1)

M=2⇒(1,0) or (0,2). Wait, but in the energy expression n_x andn_yare non-negative integers. Wait, we said M=2n_x +n_y. Thus, for M=2:

n_x can be 0, then n_y=2; or n_x=1, then n_y=0. So there are two possibilities. Hence, the degeneracy is determined by number of pairs (n_x,n_y). However, as per energy expression E= ħω (M +3/2 ), same for all pairs leading to the same M.

However, each M is attainable, hence for each non-negative integerM, the energy levels are E= ħ sqrt(k/m) ( M + 3/2 ), with M=0,1,2,...

But wait in the initial cases:

For M=0: 3/2

M=1: 5/2 (difference 1)

M=2:7/2 (difference 1)

So they're spaced by ħω, but the original problem is not isotropic, yet this approach seems to give equally spaced energy levels, similar to a 1D harmonic oscillator, but with some multiplicative factor. Wait, that's interesting. Alternatively, if it's really correct.

Wait a second, if it was a normal 2D isotropic oscillator, the energy would be E= ħω(n_x +n_y +1 ), degenerate for each (n_x,n_y) such that n_x +n_y is constant.Thus, spacing between each N (where N= n_x +n_y) is ħω. In the case here, it's similar in that for M= 2n_x +n_y, incremental M by 1 also yields incremented E by ħω. So seems analogous but with some changes in the composition.

Therefore, for the given problem, the energy levels are the same as those of a 1D harmonic oscillator with frequency ω multiplied by (M + 3/2 ), with M=0,1,2,..., and since ω= sqrt(k/m), then E= (M + 3/2 ) ħ sqrt(k/m). And each M corresponds to solutions (n_x, n_y) as outlined.

Hence, the the energy spectrum is equally spaced, similar to 1D HO but starting from (3/2)ħω.

To confirm consistency, let's check some states.

For the lowest energy level, M=0: (n_x,n_y)= (0,0). E=(0 +0 +3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. In the anisotropic oscillator, n_x=0 andn_y=0: hence E= 2*(0 +1/2) ħω_x + (0 +1/2) ħω_y ): but wait, since ω_x=2ω, ω_y=ω:

E= 2*(1/2)*2ω ħ +1/2 *ω ħ= (2*( + we wait, no.

Wait sorry: no. If in each of the directions x and y: E_x= _= (n_x +1/2) ħω_x. Similarly for E_y.

For n_x=0, E_x= (1/2) ħω_x. Similarly, E_y= (1/2) ħω_y.

Thus, E= (1/2) ħω_x + (1/2) ħω_y = (1/2 ħ )( ω_x + ω_y )

In our case, since ω_x= 2ω, ω_y=ω,

E= (1/2) (2ω + ω ) ħ= (3/2 ω ) ħ.

Correct.

ForM=0, which is n_x=0,n_y=0, gives E=(3/2)ħ ω.

M=1:

Either n_x=0, n_y=1: E_parallel= 2*(0 +1/2)ħω_x + (1 +1/2)ħω_y

= 2*(1/2)*(2ω)ħ + (3/2)*ω ħ= (2ω ħ)(1/2 *2) + (3/2) ω ħ= 2ω*1/2*2 = 2 ω (Wait, perhaps I should compute it again):

Wait,

E_{n_x, n_y} = (n_x +1/2) ħω_x + (n_y +1/2)ħω_y.

For n_x=0, n_y=1:

E= (0 +1/2) * 2ω ħ + (1 +1/2)ω ħ= (1 ω ħ ) + ( 3/2 ω ħ )= (1 +1.5) ħω =.2.5 ħω=5/2 ħ ω.
For [M=1:] Yes.

Alternatively, as per the formula E=(2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ) ħω= (2*0 +1 + 3/2 )=  (1 +3/2 )=(5/2)2.5. Correct.

Alternatively, for a different pair, say n_x=1, n_y=0:

E=(2(1) +0 +3/2 ) ħω= (2 +3/2 )=7/2. So their energy is 7/2 ħω.

But what's this corresponds to the anisotropic calculation:

n_x=1, n_y=0,

E= (1 +1/2) *2ω ħ + (0 +1/2)*ω ħ = (3/2 *2 ω ħ ) + (1/2 *ω ħ )= 3 ω ħ + 0.5 ω ħ =3.5 ω ħ =7/2 ω ħ, correct.

Thus, confirming the formula. Therefore, the energy spectrum is indeed given by:

E= ħω ( 2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )

Or simply E= ħω ( M +3/2 ),where M=0,1,2,..., each representing different combinations of n_x andn_y meeting 2n_x +n_y =M.

But the problem asks to 'Find the energy spectrum.', so listing quantized energies in terms of quantum numbers. Depending on interpretation, it should be expressed as above. Various possibilities acceptable but the most precise is in terms of distinct energies with corresponding quantum numbers.

Alternatively, providing the expression in terms of variables given noting the relationship:

Recall that ω = sqrt(k/m), thus E= ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ) for non-negative integers n_x and n_y.

Therefore, with that, the answer is { E_n = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ) | n_x, n_y ∈ ℕ ∪{0} }.

However, perhaps, the problem might accept the form in terms of (quantum numbers using angular momentum.), but according to our analysis separated into x and y oscillators and energy levels accordingly.

Thus, the energy spectrum is — the energies are given by ħ sqrt(k/m) times (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x andn_y are non-negative integers. Alternatively, in other terms, this can be written in terms of a potential that corresponds to a combination of stretches in x and y directions, leading to the given spectrum.

Therefore, the final answer is as above.

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.

However, difference arises here because our potential includes a term with r² multiplied by cos2θ. This complicates variable separation. Let me check.\n\nIf V(r, θ) = V0(r) + V1(r) f(θ), then likely the angular equation would have a term depending on V1(r) and even r², disrupting conventional variable separation. Hence, instead of standard separation, maybe re-express the equation in terms of eigenfunctions of angular momentum operator, then consider coefficients depending on r?\n\nWait, let\'s re-examine the potential:\n\nV(r, θ) = 5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ. So a radial term and a term radial squared multiplied by an angular term. Alternatively, express everything in terms of modified polar coordinates, but I\'m stuck here.\n\nAn alternative approach: Many potentials with such trigonometric functions can sometimes be connected to Mathieu’s equation or associated Legendre’s equation when rewritten appropriately. However, the radial part seems overlapped with angular momentum.\n\nAlternatively, consider gauge-like transformations or variable scaling to decode the potential. Let\'s note that for a potential with a cos2θ term, the angular equation would have solutions related to eigenfunctions of cos2θ.\n\nAlternatively, move to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). Let\'s see:\n\nGiven x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So r² = x² + y². Also, cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²). Then, V(r, θ) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Which simplifies to:\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = 2kx² + (1/2)k y².\n\nThus, by expressing in Cartesian coordinates, the potential becomes V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Huh! So transforming into Cartesian coordinates whows that the potential is actually a anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator. That\'s smarter. Hence, the problem is equivalent to a particle in a 2D harmonic oscillator potential with frequencies ω_x and ω_y, where:\n\nThe potential is V(x, y) = (1/2)m ω_x² x² + (1/2)m ω_y² y².\n\nComparing our V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y², which implies:\n\n(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k ⇒ ω_x² = 4k/m ⇒ ω_x = 2*sqrt(k/m).\n\nSimilarly, (1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2)k ⇒ ω_y² = k/m ⇒ ω_y = sqrt(k/m).\n\nTherefore, the energy levels for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by:\n\nE = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) =\n\n= 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y +1/2 )\n\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y +1/2)]\n\n= ħ √(k/m) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2], where n_x, n_y = 0,1,2,...\n\nThat simplifies to E = ħ ω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2], where ω = sqrt(k/m). Alternatively, if we define ω = sqrt(k/m), then:\n\nE = ω ħ (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).\n\nHold on, but the original expression in Cartesian coordinates led us to an anisotropic oscillator. Therefore, in Cartesian coordinates, solving the Schrödinger equation would separate into x and y components.\n\nGiven that, the energy levels are sum of the 1D harmonic oscillators in each direction with frequencies ω_x and ω_y. Therefore:\n\nE = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x + (n_y +1/2 ) ħ ω_y.\n\nSubstituting ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω, giving:\n\nE = (n_x +1/2) ħ 2ω + (n_y +1/2) ħ ω = ħω [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)].\n\nExpanding:\n\nE = ħω [2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2] = ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2].\n\nSo, yes, the energy spectrum depends on two quantum numbers n_x and n_y, each non-negative integers. Therefore, in terms of ħ, ω = sqrt(k/m), so:\n\nE_n = sqrt(k/m) ħ (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).\n\nAlternatively, define ℏ ω as frequency * Planck\'s constant. But for energy levels in harmonic oscillators, the energy is E = ħ ω (n +1/2) in 1D, so generalized to 2D with distinct frequencies.\n\nAlternatively, express in terms of m and k:\n\nGiven ω = sqrt(k/m), so √(k/m) ħ = ħ √(k/m). Alternatively, writing ħ ω = ħ sqrt(k/m) = sqrt( ħ² k /m ). But perhaps writing energy in terms of quantum numbers:\n\nHowever, the coordinate system shift made it accessible. Changing from polar to Cartesian made the potential merely anisotropic; then separation of variables is straightforward. Therefore, energy levels are as above.\n\nBut let me verify. The potential was given in polar coordinates as in V(r, θ) = ½ kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ, which transformed to Cartesian is ½ kr² + 3/2 k x² = ½ k (x² + y²) + 3/2 k x² = (3/2k x² + 1/2k y² + 3/2k x²?). Wait, perhaps a miscalculation before.\n\nWait, shifting back. Original Potential: ½ k r² + 3/2 k r² cos²θ. So first term ½ k (x² + y²), second term 3/2 k (x²). Then total V(x,y) = ½ kx² + ½ k y² + 3/2 k x² = (½ k + 3/2 k) x² + ½ k y² = 2k x² + ½ k y². Yes, exactly as before. So:\n\nComparing to the standard harmonic oscillator:\n\n(1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y². Equate to 2k x² + ½ k y². So:\n\n(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k ⇒ ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).\n\nSimilarly, (1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2)k ⇒ ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So problem reduces to anisotropic oscillator with ω_x = 2 ω_y. Consequently, energy given by E = ħ ω_x (n_x +1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y +1/2) = ħ (2 ω) (n_x +1/2) + ħ ω (n_y +1/2) where ω is sqrt(k/m). Therefore,\n\nE = ħ sqrt(k/m)[2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)] = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ).\n\nThus entire energy spectrum relies on n_x and n_y being 0,1,2,...\n\nTherefore, general formula is:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} =  ħ*sqrt(k/m)*(2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nAlternatively, factoring:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} =  (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)\n\nBut perhaps express in terms of creation and annihilation operators. But since the answer is to write the energy spectrum, desirable in terms of quantum numbers.\n\nHowever, note that in anisotropic oscillators eigenvectors are labeled by n_x and n_y. But depending on symmetries or degeneracies in the potential. However, with the frequencies ω_x = 2 ω_y, in some cases this could lead to accidental degeneracies. But regardless, for purposes of energy spectrum, answer is expressed through these two quantum numbers.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: "Find the energy spectrum."\n\nHence, the spectrum is given by equation derived, E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2…).\n\nAlternatively, in some other form by combining terms. Let’s check coefficients:\n\nThe term sqrt(k/m) is sqrt(k/m) ≡ ω, where ω was defined as sqrt(k/m) from standard harmonic oscillator.\n\nThus, using ω:\n\nE = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ ω.\n\nAlternatively, to check if the isotropic case has 3/2 term, but here due to frequencies multiplied. For the standard 2D isotropic oscillator, E = (n_x + n_y +1) ℏω. Let me see but here with different frequencies; however, here the energies cannot be labeled by just a single quantum number, but need both n_x and n_y.\n\nBut the problem is in two dimensions. So, the Energy is quantized accordingly with two quantum numbers. Hence, the energy spectrum is En_x,n_y = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏω, where ω = sqrt(k/m), with n_x,n_y ∈ ℕ₀.\n\nIs this the correct answer?\n\nAlternatively, does this hold?\n\nLet me verify again by cross-check conversions. Yes, after converting to Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². The potential is diagonal in x and y. Therefore, indeed the solution is a product of harmonic oscillator states in x and y with respective frequencies.\n\nSince the energy in the x direction is (n_x +1/2) ℏωx, and similarly for y. But given our original potential, ωx = 2 sqrt(k/m), and ωy = sqrt(k/m). Hence, Energy = (n_x +1/2)*2*sqrt(k/m)*ℏ + (n_y +1/2)*sqrt(k/m)*ℏ = sqrt(k/m)*ℏ*(2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2) = sqrt(k/m)*ℏ*(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), which matches the earlier result. Hence, perfect.\n\nBut in problems similar to 2D harmonic oscillator with differing frequencies, this seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original problem can also be approached through polar coordinates.

To find the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle moving in two dimensions with the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

Expressing the potential in terms of \( x \) and \( y \), we use \( x = r \cos(\theta) \) and \( y = r \sin(\theta) \), which gives:
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2} k x^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2} ky^2
\]

This potential represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions. The frequencies are determined by comparing the potential to the standard harmonic oscillator form \( \frac{1}{2} m \omega_x^2 x^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \omega_y^2 y^2 \):
\[
\frac{1}{2} m \omega_x^2 = 2k \implies \omega_x = 2 \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} m \omega_y^2 = \frac{1}{2}k \implies \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

The energy levels for a particle in an anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the sum of the energies from each direction:
\[
E = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Substituting the frequencies \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \):
\[
E = \hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):
\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right]
\]
\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)
\]

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by:
\[
\boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]
where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

Alternatively, variable separation might still hold by redefining certain parameters, but we proceed.

Returning to the Schrödinger equation:

Separate variables by equating to -λ for the angular part and the remaining for the radial. However, difference arises here because our potential includes a term with r² multiplied by cos2θ. This complicates variable separation. Let me check.

If V(r, θ) = V0(r) + V1(r) f(θ), then likely the angular equation would have a term depending on V1(r) and even r², disrupting conventional variable separation. Hence, instead of standard separation, maybe re-express the equation in terms of eigenfunctions of angular momentum operator, then consider coefficients depending on r?

Wait, let's re-examine the potential:

V(r, θ) = 5/4 kr² + 3/4 kr² cos2θ. So a radial term and a term radial squared multiplied by an angular term. Alternatively, express everything in terms of modified polar coordinates, but I'm stuck here.

An alternative approach: Many potentials with such trigonometric functions can sometimes be connected to Mathieu’s equation or associated Legendre’s equation when rewritten appropriately. However, the radial part seems overlapped with angular momentum.

Alternatively, consider gauge-like transformations or variable scaling to decode the potential. Let's note that for a potential with a cos2θ term, the angular equation would have solutions related to eigenfunctions of cos2θ.

Alternatively, move to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). Let's see:

Given x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So r² = x² + y². Also, cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²). Then, V(r, θ) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Which simplifies to:

V(x, y) = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = 2kx² + (1/2)k y².

Thus, by expressing in Cartesian coordinates, the potential becomes V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Huh! So transforming into Cartesian coordinates whows that the potential is actually a anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator. That's smarter. Hence, the problem is equivalent to a particle in a 2D harmonic oscillator potential with frequencies ω_x and ω_y, where:

The potential is V(x, y) = (1/2)m ω_x² x² + (1/2)m ω_y² y².

Comparing our V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y², which implies:

(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k ⇒ ω_x² = 4k/m ⇒ ω_x = 2*sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, (1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2)k ⇒ ω_y² = k/m ⇒ ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Therefore, the energy levels for a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by:

E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) =

= 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y +1/2 )

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y +1/2)]

= ħ √(k/m) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2], where n_x, n_y = 0,1,2,...

That simplifies to E = ħ ω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2], where ω = sqrt(k/m). Alternatively, if we define ω = sqrt(k/m), then:

E = ω ħ (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).

Hold on, but the original expression in Cartesian coordinates led us to an anisotropic oscillator. Therefore, in Cartesian coordinates, solving the Schrödinger equation would separate into x and y components.

Given that, the energy levels are sum of the 1D harmonic oscillators in each direction with frequencies ω_x and ω_y. Therefore:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x + (n_y +1/2 ) ħ ω_y.

Substituting ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω, giving:

E = (n_x +1/2) ħ 2ω + (n_y +1/2) ħ ω = ħω [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)].

Expanding:

E = ħω [2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2] = ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2].

So, yes, the energy spectrum depends on two quantum numbers n_x and n_y, each non-negative integers. Therefore, in terms of ħ, ω = sqrt(k/m), so:

E_n = sqrt(k/m) ħ (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).

Alternatively, define ℏ ω as frequency * Planck's constant. But for energy levels in harmonic oscillators, the energy is E = ħ ω (n +1/2) in 1D, so generalized to 2D with distinct frequencies.

Alternatively, express in terms of m and k:

Given ω = sqrt(k/m), so √(k/m) ħ = ħ √(k/m). Alternatively, writing ħ ω = ħ sqrt(k/m) = sqrt( ħ² k /m ). But perhaps writing energy in terms of quantum numbers:

However, the coordinate system shift made it accessible. Changing from polar to Cartesian made the potential merely anisotropic; then separation of variables is straightforward. Therefore, energy levels are as above.

But let me verify. The potential was given in polar coordinates as in V(r, θ) = ½ kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ, which transformed to Cartesian is ½ kr² + 3/2 k x² = ½ k (x² + y²) + 3/2 k x² = (3/2k x² + 1/2k y² + 3/2k x²?). Wait, perhaps a miscalculation before.

Wait, shifting back. Original Potential: ½ k r² + 3/2 k r² cos²θ. So first term ½ k (x² + y²), second term 3/2 k (x²). Then total V(x,y) = ½ kx² + ½ k y² + 3/2 k x² = (½ k + 3/2 k) x² + ½ k y² = 2k x² + ½ k y². Yes, exactly as before. So:

Comparing to the standard harmonic oscillator:

(1/2) m ω_x² x² + (1/2) m ω_y² y². Equate to 2k x² + ½ k y². So:

(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k ⇒ ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, (1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2)k ⇒ ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So problem reduces to anisotropic oscillator with ω_x = 2 ω_y. Consequently, energy given by E = ħ ω_x (n_x +1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y +1/2) = ħ (2 ω) (n_x +1/2) + ħ ω (n_y +1/2) where ω is sqrt(k/m). Therefore,

E = ħ sqrt(k/m)[2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)] = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ).

Thus entire energy spectrum relies on n_x and n_y being 0,1,2,...

Therefore, general formula is:

E_{n_x, n_y} =  ħ*sqrt(k/m)*(2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Alternatively, factoring:

E_{n_x, n_y} =  (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) * ħ * sqrt(k/m)

But perhaps express in terms of creation and annihilation operators. But since the answer is to write the energy spectrum, desirable in terms of quantum numbers.

However, note that in anisotropic oscillators eigenvectors are labeled by n_x and n_y. But depending on symmetries or degeneracies in the potential. However, with the frequencies ω_x = 2 ω_y, in some cases this could lead to accidental degeneracies. But regardless, for purposes of energy spectrum, answer is expressed through these two quantum numbers.

Wait, going back to the problem statement: "Find the energy spectrum."

Hence, the spectrum is given by equation derived, E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2…).

Alternatively, in some other form by combining terms. Let’s check coefficients:

The term sqrt(k/m) is sqrt(k/m) ≡ ω, where ω was defined as sqrt(k/m) from standard harmonic oscillator.

Thus, using ω:

E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ ω.

Alternatively, to check if the isotropic case has 3/2 term, but here due to frequencies multiplied. For the standard 2D isotropic oscillator, E = (n_x + n_y +1) ℏω. Let me see but here with different frequencies; however, here the energies cannot be labeled by just a single quantum number, but need both n_x and n_y.

But the problem is in two dimensions. So, the Energy is quantized accordingly with two quantum numbers. Hence, the energy spectrum is En_x,n_y = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏω, where ω = sqrt(k/m), with n_x,n_y ∈ ℕ₀.

Is this the correct answer?

Alternatively, does this hold?

Let me verify again by cross-check conversions. Yes, after converting to Cartesian coordinates, V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². The potential is diagonal in x and y. Therefore, indeed the solution is a product of harmonic oscillator states in x and y with respective frequencies.

Since the energy in the x direction is (n_x +1/2) ℏωx, and similarly for y. But given our original potential, ωx = 2 sqrt(k/m), and ωy = sqrt(k/m). Hence, Energy = (n_x +1/2)*2*sqrt(k/m)*ℏ + (n_y +1/2)*sqrt(k/m)*ℏ = sqrt(k/m)*ℏ*(2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2) = sqrt(k/m)*ℏ*(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), which matches the earlier result. Hence, perfect.

But in problems similar to 2D harmonic oscillator with differing frequencies, this seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem can also be approached through polar coordinates. To explore, say, in polar coordinates, the angular equation may include terms coupling to r². But converting that makes us go back though returning Cartesian lets the potential become separable.

Hence, Cartesian coordinates are the smarter approach.

Alternatively, is the potential separable in polar coordinates? Let's see.

If consider Sol:try separation in polar coordinates? Assume ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Θ(θ)

Incorporating the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Then, the Schrödinger equation is:

[-ℏ²/(2m) ( (1/r)d/dr(r dR/dr)Θ + R/r² d²Θ/dθ² ) + (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ) R Θ ] = E R Θ

Divide both sides by R Θ:

-ℏ²/(2m) [ (1/R)(1/r d/dr(r dR/dr )) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² ] + (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ ) = E

Multiply both sides by (-2m)/ℏ²:

( 1/R ) (1/r d/dr(r dR/dr )) + (1/(r² Θ)) d²Θ/dθ² - ( 2m/(ℏ²) )(1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ ) = - 2m E / ℏ²

Group terms multiplied by different functions. Let’s bring all r dependent terms to r part and theta terms to theta part:

So:

1/r R [d/dr(r dR/dr )] - (m k r²)/(ℏ²) (1 + 3 cos²θ ) + (1/Θ r²) d²Θ/dθ² = - 2m E / ( ℏ² ) * r²

But this equation has mixed r and θ in middle term, hence making separation non-trivial. The term -(m k r²)/(ℏ²)(1 + 3 cos²θ ) combines r² and angular functions. Therefore, ordinary separation r and θ is obstructed. Unless you can express 3 cos²θ as a linear combination of angular momentum eigenfunctions which for l=2, but such attempts may not separate variables. As previously done, translating to Cartesian allows separation.

Hence, verified that Cartesian decomposition shows potential is a 2D anisotropic oscillator, separable in x and y. Hence, problem is separable in Cartesian coordinates but not in polar coordinates.

Therefore, answer's formula must wrap the Energy Expression:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ℏ √(k/m) (2 n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Thus, energy spectrum is given by two quantum numbers n_x and n_y. Possibly even note that substitution variables can lead to degeneracy conditions if possible. However, since the frequencies are now different (ω_x=2 ω_y), the system's energy levels might not have any degeneracy beyond permutation of quantum numbers, but only specific combinations 2n_x +n_y, a linear Diophantine equation which likely allows uniqueness up to substitutions. Nevertheless, standard answer would present energy as quantized per (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ), as uncovered.

Summing up, after my disquisition through separating variables, converting potential to Cartesian coordinate system, and solving for an anisotropic harmonic oscillator facilitates identification of quantum numbers and hence, the energy spectrum.

Checking the coefficients:

In standard 1D harmonic oscillator, E = (n+ 1/2 ) ℏω.

So, for x-direction oscillator with ωx=2ω, E_x = (n_x +1/2)(2ℏω)

Wait: let me see, ω is sqrt(k/m), so in problem expression:

In the x-direction, the frequency is ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) ⇒ ωx =2 ω, with ω = sqrt(k/m) as standard definition.

Then E_x = ℏ ω_x (n_x +1/2) = (2 ℏ ω) (n_x +1/2 )

Similarly, y-direction has ωy= sqrt(k/m)= ω, so E_y= ℏ ω (n_y +1/2 )

So Total Energy:

E_total = E_x + E_y = 2ℏω (n_x +1/2 ) + ℏ ω (n_y +1/2 )= ℏ ω(2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2 ) = ℏ ω (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ).

Expressed as per the previous result. So to recap, E = ℏ sqrt(k/m)(2n_x +n_y +3/2 )

Conclusion: Correct.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is quantized as (2n_x +n_y +3/2 ) in units of ℏ√(k/m). So, summarizing, the explicit answer in box notation would be:

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.
