Okay, let me see how I can figure out which of these compounds are optically active. So, optical activity is when a compound has a chiral center and isn't superposable on its mirror image, right? So each chiral center contributes to the possibility, but also things like internal planes of symmetry can make them not chiral even if they have stereocenters. Let's go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, wait. But but-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait the double bond is at 1-2 position. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Maybe better to draw it mentally. Let's see. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. For 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, substituting Cl at position 1 (which is the first carbon of the double bond). So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and CH(CH3), and C2 has CH2. Wait, but for such a structure, does it have a chiral center? The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is connected to Cl, a methyl group (since it's 2-methyl, the methyl is on C2?), maybe not. Wait maybe the compound is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. No, when numbering but-1-ene, positions are 1,2,3,4. So 1 is the first carbon of the double bond, so 1 is CH2Cl, 2 is C(CH3), double bonded to C1, and then CH2. Hmm. But in any case, for (Z) configuration, the groups on each carbon of the double bond need to have higher priority groups on the same side. But regardless, the question is about whether the compound is optically active. Now, would this compound have a chiral center? The double bond is between C-1 and C-2. Let's see. C-1 would be: attached to Cl, CH(CH3) (since it's 2-methyl?), a double bond to C2, and maybe another substituent. Wait I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, replacing a hydrogen on C1 (the first carbon of the double bond) with Cl. So C1 is Cl, double bond to C2, which has a methyl group (since 2-methyl), then C3 and C4 are CH2CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons: CH2=CHCH2CH3. So numbering is 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), then 3 (CH2), 4 (CH3). If we put a Cl on C1, which is the first carbon of the double bond, so perhaps the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but that might not make sense because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe C1 is Cl, then C2 is the next carbon with the double bond and a methyl group. Wait, but that might not follow. Maybe I need to name the structure properly. If I have a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 1: CH2=CHCH2CH3. The 2-methyl substituent would be on C2, which is the CH in the double bond. So adding a methyl to C2 would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait no, but the parent chain is but-1-ene. Let me think. Maybe the correct structure is Cl attached to C1, the double bond at 1-2, and a methyl group attached to C2. So, structure: Cl–C(CH3)=CH–CH2. But positions are 1 (Cl), 2 (CH with a methyl and double bond), 3 (CH), and 4 (CH2). Is that correct?

But regardless, the key question is whether this compound has a chiral center. Let's check. The possible chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So let's look at each carbon. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1: attachments would be Cl, double bond (to C2), CH(CH3), and what else? Wait, no. If the structure is Cl–C(CH3)=CH–CH2, perhaps C1 is attached to Cl, C(CH3), a double bond, and a hydrogen? Wait if the double bond is between C1 and C2, the substituents on each are: C1 would be Cl, a methyl (from 2-methyl), and two bonds to C2. No, actually, for a double bond, each carbon involved is connected by two bonds. So the substituents on C1 would be Cl and CH(CH3), and on C2 would be two groups (maybe a H and a CH2CH3? Not sure). But optical activity isn't from the double bond itself but from chiral centers. So does any of the carbons in this structure have four different substituents? Let me think again.

Assuming the structure is like Cl–C(CH3)=CH2–CH3? That might not fit the but-1-ene part. Wait, perhaps the actual structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But if it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then the chloro is on carbon 1, the double bond is between carbon 1 and 2. So carbon 1 would have Cl, a double bond to C2, a CH2CH2 (I think no). Wait, maybe it's better to write out the full structure. For but-1-ene, the skeleton is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then substituting a chlorine on the first carbon (which is part of the double bond, right?). So that would give Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, that would make the chlorine on a carbon adjacent to the double bond. Hmmm. I'm a bit confused here, but let's suppose that the structure is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which has a double bond with Cl and a methyl group on each carbon. Wait, maybe. The positions are such that C-1 is the first carbon of the double bond. So if the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then the groups on C-1 are Cl and the double bond, and on C-2 are methyl and the double bond. Wait, so in such a case, the structure is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, not really. If but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, replacing hydrogen on C1 with Cl gives Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond at 1-2? I think I need to clarify this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is Cl attached to C1 and a methyl group on C2, with the double bond between C1 and C2. Then, on C1: Cl, two bonds to C2 (as the double bond), and a CH2 group? Alternatively, maybe it’s (CH2Cl)C(CH3)=CHCH3. This is getting too tangled; maybe another approach. For a compound to have a chiral center, there must be a carbon with four different groups. In the (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, does any carbon have that?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is chloro on C1 and methyl on C2, both on the same carbon of the double bond. Wait, but then double bond may lead to different structures. Let's imagine C=C, with Cl and a methyl on one carbon. Wait, but that's not possible if the double bond is in between. Wait, perhaps (Z) refers to the configuration around the double bond, but unless there are two different groups on each carbon of the double bond, there is no possibility for E/Z isomerism. So maybe if the double bond is between C1 and C2, with Cl and a methyl group on C1, and two other groups on C2. Let me check: For Z isomer, substituents of higher priority on each carbon are on the same side. But regardless, optical activity would require a chiral center. Now, do they have any chiral centers here? Let's suppose C1 has Cl, methyl, and two CH2 groups (as part of the chain). No, perhaps not. Let’s forgo this and maybe check the answer. Alternatively, in such alkenes, sometimes there can be a chiral center if, for example, the substituents are arranged in a way that gives four different groups. But if the groups on either end of the double bond are not creating a chiral center. Let's think, maybe in this compound, there's no chiral center. Because the carbons adjacent to the double bond have substituents that might not be four different. Let's say C1 has Cl, CH(CH3), and then two from the double bond. No, but in a double bond, each carbon is connected via two bonds. So the substituents would be Cl, the methyl, and the two CH2 groups? Not sure. Maybe not a chiral center here, so (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene might not be optically active. Alternatively, maybe because the double bond can make the molecule non-planar? But molecules with double bonds can still be chiral if other centers are present. But perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. So maybe it's not optically active. So likely: no.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Wow, that's complicated. So this is a bicyclic compound with multiple rings. The substituents here include a chloromethylene group (probably Cl attached to a methylene group which is part of a ring junction). Then, in the name, we have the E configuration for the chloromethylene. Given the complexity, perhaps this compound has multiple stereocenters. The configuration is given as 3aR and 7aS, and the double bond is E. So regardless of any internal planes of symmetry, if there are multiple stereocenters and no plane of symmetry, then the compound might be chiral. The presence of both R and S configurations in the bicyclic system could create a non-superimposable mirror image. However, depending on the structure, perhaps it’s a bridged or fused ring with symmetries. For example, if 3aR and 7aS are in positions that are mirror images due to the ring structure, making the molecule achiral. But I'm not sure. Given that it's (3aR,7aS,E), these two stereocenters, and the E configuration. If the molecule has other symmetries, maybe but perhaps not. Considering that the prefixes are different (3a and 7a), likely they are distinct stereocenters. Therefore, the compound would have multiple stereocenters and since there's no mention of internal planes, would have optical activity. So I think yes, this compound is optically active.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. The structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Succinic acid is HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH. So replacing the two middle CH2 groups with CH(CH3). So each of the two middle carbons (positions 2 and 3) have a methyl group. The configuration is 2R and 3S. So in terms of optical activity, if both centers are there, but in this case, maybe there's a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine: the molecule is a central two carbons, both with methyl groups and the configurations R and S. If you look at a mirror plane between the two carbons, if the configurations are opposite, R and S, then maybe the molecule is a meso compound. For example, tartaric acid has two stereocenters (R,R and S,S) which are optically active, and meso-tartaric acid has R,S with a plane of symmetry and is not active. So here, if the two stereocenters are R and S but have a plane of symmetry midways, then the compound would be meso. So (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid, is this a meso compound? Let's check. If the two central carbons have R and S configurations, then the molecule may have an internal plane of symmetry. So yes, in such a case, the compound is a meso compound, so despite having stereocenters, it's not optically active. So this compound would not be optically active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. That structure would have both stereocenters as R configurations. Now, if both are R, then there isn't a plane of symmetry. Because mirroring the molecule would result in both being S. Therefore, this compound would not be a meso compound but a diastereomer. Therefore, it would be optically active. So this one is active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So here, the cyclohexene ring has a hydroxyl group on carbon 1, and the double bond at position 3 (between carbons 3 and 4). The configuration is R. However, the carbon where the hydroxyl is attached (C1) must have four different substituents to be a chiral center. So, in cyclohexene, the substituents on C1 would be: OH, two adjacent carbons (C6 and C2), and the ring (which includes the double bond). Wait, is there a plane of symmetry? For cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, if the double bond is in position 3-4, and the OH is on carbon 1, is that carbon a chiral center? Let me visualize. The cyclohexene ring has six carbons. If we number it as such: 1 (OH), 2, 3 (double bond to 4), 4, 5, 6. So carbon 1 has: OH, C6, C2, and another substituent (the ring itself, which is different because of the double bond?). Wait, the actual substituents on C1 would be: the hydroxyl group, a ring junction to C6 (a CH2 group?), to C2 (another CH2?), and then the ring. Wait, perhaps that's not four distinct groups. Wait, carbon 1 would have:

Connected to:

1. OH
2. Carbon 6 (which in cyclohexene, maybe is a CH2 group)
3. Carbon 2 (another CH2 group)
4. The fourth bond is part of the ring. But wait, carbon in the cyclohexene ring would only have two substituents besides the two adjacent carbons. Wait, no, that's mistaken. All carbons in the cyclohexene ring are part of the ring. Carbon 1 is in the ring, so substituents would be OH, C2, C6, and the ring's structure. Wait, all cyclohexene carbons are connected in a ring. So each carbon has two adjacent ring carbons. If there's a double bond between C3 and C4, then the ring's structure has a double bond. So for C1, which is adjacent to C2 and C6, and has an OH group. So the substituent on C1 would be OH, C2, C6, and the rest of the ring (which then may not be symmetric).

Wait, but in a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, how does that affect the substituents on C1? Let's imagine in more detail. Carbon 1 has OH, and is connected to C2 and C6, which are both in the ring. If the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, the structure of the ring is such that carbons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 arranged in a ring with a double bond between 3 and 4. So C1 is between C6 and C2, which are single bonds. Therefore, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- C2 (CH)
- C6 (CH)
- Another hydrogen? No, wait that depends on the hybridization. Carbon in a cyclohexene ring is typically sp3 hybridized except for the double bond (sp2). Hmm. Wait, if the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, then those two carbons are sp2, and the others are sp3. So for C1, assuming it's sp3 (since it's attached to an OH group), it's attached to:

- HO-
- two CH2 groups (C2 and C6)
- and another group. Wait, but in the chair conformation or any conformation, may not be possible. Maybe it's easier to think of the structure as cyclohexene ring with an OH on C1. If C1's substituents are:

1. OH
2. C2 (which is a CH2, since C2 is next to the double bond at C3-C4)
3. C6 (also CH2)
4. One hydrogen

But wait, sp3? If C1 is in a chair-like structure with substitution. Wait, perhaps C1 is CH-OH, connected to C2 and C6. Then the substituent arrangement might be: OH, C2, C6, and two H's? No, that's three substituents. Wait, perhaps I need to count substituents. Wait, the carbon 1 would be connected to:

- The oxygen from OH
- C2 (which is -CH2-)
- C6 (another -CH2-)
- And a hydrogen

But that's four substituents: OH, CH2-, CH2-, H. But those are not four different groups. If two of them are CH2 (C2 and C6) then carbon 1 would have three substituents: CH2, CH2, H, and OH. So two CH2 groups (same), H and OH. Hence, only three distinct groups. So the carbon isn't a chiral center. Wait, but wait. If C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which are both CH2 groups in the ring, but perhaps structurally different because the ring is asymmetrical due to the double bond.

For example, in the cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, the substituents around the ring might not be symmetrical. Let me imagine: in a chair-like structure, the ring might be puckered, but with the double bond making it more rigid. The presence of the double bond would create different arrangements around the ring. So even though C1 is connected to C2 and C6, those two may be in different environments. For example, C2 is adjacent to C3 (part of the double bond), while C6 is adjacent to C5, which in turn is adjacent to C4 (the other end of the double bond). This could lead to C2 and C6 being in different environments. Therefore, then substituents on C1 would be:

OH, C2 (which is next to a double bond), C6 (farther from the double bond), and a hydrogen. Let's suppose, if the substituents are all different, the carbon may be chiral. But wait, depends on the precise geometry.

Alternatively, maybe in (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the OH is on C1, and the structure allows for four different groups. If the ring's other substituents at C2 and C6, especially their own substituents, make the substituents on C1 different. For example, the C2 is adjacent to C3 (double bond), so C2's substituents would be different from C6's. For instance, if the double bond is between C3 and C4, C2 is next to the double bond (so perhaps a CH like, for example, the carbons adjacent to the double bond have different substituents.

But I think that even so, the groups on C1 would be OH, two different CH groups, and one hydrogen? If the C2 and C6 are both CH2, but due to the double bond, C2's position is closer to the double bond. But then, would those two CH2 groups be considered different substituents? Substituents are determined based on the atoms attached, not their position in the ring. So if C2 is -CH2-, same as C6, then they are the same substituent. Therefore, even positioned in different parts of the ring, if the substituent is the same (i.e., a CH2 group), then the carbon would not be a chiral center. Therefore, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol may not have a chiral center, contradicting the (R) designation. Wait, but the compound is given with an (R) configuration. That implies that there's a chiral center there. So maybe the carbon attached to the OH does indeed have four different substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial analysis is wrong. Let me think again. In a cyclohexene ring, all the ring's carbons except for the double bond are sp3. So the carbon with the OH group (C1) is sp3 hybridized. Which substituents does it have? Its adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) each have two substituents (maybe hydrogen and another part of the ring). However, the presence of the double bond can disrupt the symmetry. Let's model the ring as follows:

Numbering: 1 (OH), 2, 3 (double bond to 4), 4, 5, 6.

Carbon 1: bonds to C2, C6, and has an OH group and a hydrogen.

If the cyclohexene ring is in a chair or boat conformation, then the positions of substituents may be different.

Alternatively, if the double bond is trans, making the ring less flexible. But even so, perhaps the substituents on C1 (C2 and C6) are enantiomorphs in the ring. No, maybe not. It's complicated. But considering that if the carbon has four different substituents, it's a chiral center. For C1, substituents are:

- OH
- The CH2 group (C2)
- One other part from the ring (C6)
- A hydrogen

Wait, but if the C6 is part of the same ring structure, maybe the substituents on C6 and C2 are in fact similar. Alternatively, if after the double bond, the groups attached to C2 and C6 are distinct. If the path from C1 to C2 is adjacent to a double bond (C3), whereas the path from C1 to C6 is towards C5 and then C4 (the other end of the double bond). The substituents on C2 are part of a chain adjacent to the double bond, making their environments different from C6. Therefore, maybe the groups connected to C1 (C2 and C6) are distinct because one leads toward the double bond and the other away. If so, then the substituents would be considered different, making C1 a chiral center with four distinct groups. Thus, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have a chiral center and would be optically active. So this one is active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. Three hydroxyl groups on the cyclohexane ring, all in the same position (s refers to stereochemistry? Wait, the notation is 1s,3s,5s. So that's in the all axial positions? Wait, cis or trans. Alternatively, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, when all three hydroxyls are in the same configuration. If all three are on the same face (cis), then the molecule might have an internal plane of symmetry. For example, if the three OH groups are all axial or equatorial. Alternatively, in cyclohexane triol, if all three are cis (all up or all down), the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So for example, if the three hydroxyls are in a symmetric arrangement, perhaps the compound is not chiral. Think about a cyclohexane ring with OH groups at 1,3,5 all axial; due to the chair conformation, this might make them symmetrically placed, leading to an overall achiral molecule. The presence of three stereocenters with the same configuration might lead to a meso compound.

Alternatively, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, if all the hydroxyls are in the same configuration (all R or all S), is the compound chiral? Alternatively, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? For instance, a tri-substituted cyclohexane at positions 1,3,5 each with an OH group. If they are all axial, in the chair conformation, there could be a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the ring's axis. So if you have three OH groups, each at 120 degrees apart on the ring, there might be a three-fold axis of symmetry, which could make the molecule achiral. For example, in such a symmetric arrangement, any chiral centers might be canceled out by symmetry. Thus, the overall molecule could be achiral, despite having stereocenters. Therefore, this compound would not be optically active. So seventh compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: no optical activity.

Finally, seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butanone. Butanone is (R)-methylpropanone. The structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3), I think. So the ketone is at position 1 of the butanone (which is the first carbon, so the structure is O=C-cyclopentyl-CH2-CH(CH3). The carbon adjacent to the ketone (the first carbon) is connected to the cyclopentyl group, a carbonyl group, and two CH2 and CH(CH3) groups? Wait, no: butanone is (butan-1-one: structure (CH2)3-C(O)CH3?). Wait, no: butanone is more accurately CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3 (butan-2-one). However, "butan-1-one" is a less common structure, which would be (CH2)3-C(O)H, but that is an aldehyde. Wait, maybe the structure provided is actually O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-cyclopentyl. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the name: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The butan-1-one indicates the ketone group is on carbon 1. Therefore, the structure is: O=C-C(C3H7)-CH(CH3). Wait, commas are important. Wait, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: the substituents on the carbonyl carbon (position 1) are a cyclopentyl group, two more carbons in the butan chain, and a methyl group at position 3. The actual structure might be cyclopentyl attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1), followed by CH2 and CH(CH3). So structure: O=C-(Ccyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3). The carbonyl group is at C1; so:

- C1: O=C-
- Surrounding substituents: cyclopentyl group (attached to C1), and two CH2 and CH(CH3) groups on C2 and C3. Wait, but the chain is only four carbons (butanone). Let me count. Butan-1-one should have four carbons with the ketone at position 1. So:

 CO
 |
 C1 (connected to cyclopentyl)
 |
 C2-CH2
 |
 C3-CH(CH3)
 |
 C4?

No, but the butanone is only four carbons. So if position 1 is the ketone, it would be O=C-(CH2)2-CH(CH3). Wait I'm confused. Let me think again. Butanone is a four-carbon molecule with the ketone group. For butan-1-one, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But typically, butanone is butan-2-one. However, butan-1-one would have a very strained structure. Maybe in this case, the name is different. Alternatively, maybe it's cyclopentyl attached to the first carbon of butan-1-one. So the structure would be (cyclopentyl)(C(O))(CH2)2CH3. The central carbon (C1) would have substituents: cyclopentyl, carbonyl oxygen, and two methylenes. Wait, no. But butan-1-one would be:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would have the carbonyl on C1. However, carbonyl carbons are only bonded to two other carbons. So in this case, butan-1-one would be (propyl)ketone, i.e., pentan-2-one? I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, maybe the name is an error, but regardless, according to the given name, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's break it down.

The longest chain is butanone, with the ketone at position 1. Therefore, the structure is O=C-C(R)-CH(CH3)-CH3. Where R is cyclopentyl. So the carbonyl is at C1. Then comes C2 (connected to cyclopentyl), then C3 (has a methyl group), and C4 (CH3). So, substituents on the ketone carbon (C1) are O, and two R and R'. Wait, but ketone carbons are unsaturated (double bond to oxygen), so not a tetrahedral center but trigonal planar. Therefore, there's no chiral center at C1 because it's sp² hybridized and only has three substituents. So the only potential chiral centers are elsewhere. Let's check the rest. The C2 (carbon after the ketone) has substituents: cyclopentyl, C1 (carbonyl), C3 (CH(CH3)), and perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, but for C2 in butan-1-one: if it's C2, after the ketone, would have atoms:

Butan-1-one would be like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH3. So that's three carbons after the ketone. So substituting cyclopentyl at position 1. Maybe the actual structure is O=C-(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2 cyclopentyl? Not sure. This is getting too convoluted. Let's approach step by step. The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The "butan-1-one" has the ketone on carbon 1. So the main chain is four carbons with the ketone on first carbon. So the structure is:

Position 1: O=C-

Position 2: -CH2-

Position 3: -CH(CH3)-

Position 4: -CH3

But that is butan-1-one with a methyl branch on position 3 and a cyclopentyl group on position 1. Wait, but how can there be substituents on a ketone carbon? The oxygen is double-bonded, so the ketone carbon (position 1) is bonded to an oxygen and two other groups. But for butan-1-one, those two groups would be a CH2CH2CH3 group. So maybe if we have 1-cyclopentyl group suggesting that cyclopentyl is attached to position 1 (ketone carbon), along with a methyl group in position 3 of the butane chain. So the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? So the ketone carbon (C1) has a cyclopentyl group, a carbonyl oxygen, and a substituted propyl group (CH(CH3)-CH2CH3). But the ketone carbon is trigonal planar (sp²), so no chiral center there. Now, checking other carbons for chirality:

C2 (the carbon connected to the ketone): O-C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3 no. Wait, structure might be O=C-Ccyclopentyl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 (but that would be pentan?). I think I need to correct the structure here.

Actually, given the confusion for me, perhaps try to think of 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one as a molecule where the ketone is on position 1, the butan part is four carbons. So:

C1: O=C-R

R is cyclopentyl and another substituent. But a ketone can't have two substituents. The ketone is RC(=O)R', where R and R' are the substituents. So if it's 1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one, then R is cyclopentyl and R' is propyl. So structure: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3. In this case, the propyl group would be branched. Let's evaluate for chiral centers now. The carbonyl carbon is C1: no. The next carbon (C2) is CH2 which connects to C3 (CH(CH3)) and C1 (C=O). So substituents on C2: cyclopentyl-C(=O), CH2, CH(CH3), and CH3. Wait no. Alternatively, the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH3), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the ketone at C1 would have:

  
Properly, O=C-R, where R would be a propyl group with a cyclopentyl substitution. Alternatively, the name indicates that on butan-1-one (which is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3), we have a cyclopentyl substituent on C1, which is part of the ketone. Actually, no, the ketone carbon can only be bonded to two substituents. I think I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, the name is misleading me. Let me refer to substituent positions. The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, implying that on the butan-1-one (carbonylic carbon is at position 1), substituents are a cyclopentyl group and the other required substituent. But ketones can't have more than two substituents on the carbonyl carbon because it's double-bonded. Wait, maybe the "1-cyclopentyl" is not on the carbonyl carbon but the first carbon of the chain. Let me re-express the name again. The IUPAC nomenclature would allow numbering from the end near the ketone.

Butan-1-one would be:

R-C(=O)-R', where R is CH2CH2CH3 and R' is CH3. Hmmm, no, that doesn't align.

Alternatively, the structure is cyclopentyl connected to the carbon adjacent to the ketone. For example, if named as 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, then the ketone is at position 1, the cyclopentyl is also at position 1 (thus, on the ketone carbon), but that leaves how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the name. Perhaps it's (3-methylbutan-1-yl)cyclopentyl ketone. So, the ketone is between cyclopentyl and 3-methylbutyl groups. So structure: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. But I think that would be inconsistent with the name given. The name has "butan-1-one" which would fix the ketone at position 1. If the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure could be a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butanone, but the ketone is on the first carbon. So:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-C6H11 (cyclopentyl). Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is different. In any case, regardless of the structure's confusion, the critical point is identifying any chiral centers. The ketone carbon is sp² and not chiral. Any other carbons must be checked. For example, if there's a carbon connected to four different groups. Let's suppose there's a carbon in the substituents. The 3-methyl group, for instance. Carbon 3 in the butan chain. If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl, then the third carbon (CH(CH3)) might have substituents: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4?), methyl, and carbonyl. Wait, maybe:

Butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So in the compound, we substitute: at position 1 (ketone), yeah, no.

Wait, another approach. Let's say the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the butan chain is from the ketone. The groups attached to the ketone carbon (C1) are cyclopentyl and the rest of the chain. Since the ketone is O=C-R, where R would be a propyl (butan minus the ketone carbon) group, but substituted with a methyl and a cyclopentyl.

Wait, hopefully, to prevent getting stuck here, let me accept that no chiral centers are present. The key is checking if there are any sp³ carbons with four different groups. Maybe in position C3. If there is a carbon (say, at carbon 3) that's connected to:

- a methyl group,

- two CH2 groups,

- and some other group.

Wait, for example, if it's O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl, then in this chain:

C1: O=C- (sp²)

C2: CH2 (connected to C1 and C3)

C3: CH(CH3) (possibly with connections to C2, C4, and a methyl group)

But connecting to cyclopentyl? Maybe not, I'm not getting this. Alternatively, the tarting point is wrong. Perhaps there’s no chiral center, therefore 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is not optically active. Thus, inactive.

Summarizing:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Not active.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe there’s no chiral centers, so not active.

Second compound: Yes active.

Third compound: Meso, not active.

Fourth compound: Active (not meso).

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Active.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-triol: Not active.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Not active.

Therefore, compounds that are active: 2nd, 4th, 5th. So three active compounds.

Wait wait. Let me list out in order:

1. (Z)-compound: considered not active.

2. The hexahydro...dione: active.

3. (2R,3S): inactive (meso).

4. (2R,3R): active.

5. (R)-cyclo: active.

6. Triol in all s: inactive.

7. The ketone: inactive.

Total active: 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let me see how I can figure out which of these compounds are optically active. So, optical activity is when a compound has a chiral center and isn't superposable on its mirror image, right? So each chiral center contributes to the possibility, but also things like internal planes of symmetry can make them not chiral even if they have stereocenters. Let's go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, wait. But but-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait the double bond is at 1-2 position. So the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Maybe better to draw it mentally. Let's see. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. For 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, substituting Cl at position 1 (which is the first carbon of the double bond). So the structure would be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and CH(CH3), and C2 has CH2. Wait, but for such a structure, does it have a chiral center? The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is connected to Cl, a methyl group (since it's 2-methyl, the methyl is on C2?), maybe not. Wait maybe the compound is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. No, when numbering but-1-ene, positions are 1,2,3,4. So 1 is the first carbon of the double bond, so 1 is CH2Cl, 2 is C(CH3), double bonded to C1, and then CH2. Hmm. But in any case, for (Z) configuration, the groups on each carbon of the double bond need to have higher priority groups on the same side. But regardless, the question is about whether the compound is optically active. Now, would this compound have a chiral center? The double bond is between C-1 and C-2. Let's see. C-1 would be: attached to Cl, CH(CH3) (since it's 2-methyl?), a double bond to C2, and maybe another substituent. Wait I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, replacing a hydrogen on C1 (the first carbon of the double bond) with Cl. So C1 is Cl, double bond to C2, which has a methyl group (since 2-methyl), then C3 and C4 are CH2CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons: CH2=CHCH2CH3. So numbering is 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), then 3 (CH2), 4 (CH3). If we put a Cl on C1, which is the first carbon of the double bond, so perhaps the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but that might not make sense because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe C1 is Cl, then C2 is the next carbon with the double bond and a methyl group. Wait, but that might not follow. Maybe I need to name the structure properly. If I have a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at position 1: CH2=CHCH2CH3. The 2-methyl substituent would be on C2, which is the CH in the double bond. So adding a methyl to C2 would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait no, but the parent chain is but-1-ene. Let me think. Maybe the correct structure is Cl attached to C1, the double bond at 1-2, and a methyl group attached to C2. So, structure: Cl–C(CH3)=CH–CH2. But positions are 1 (Cl), 2 (CH with a methyl and double bond), 3 (CH), and 4 (CH2). Is that correct?

But regardless, the key question is whether this compound has a chiral center. Let's check. The possible chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So let's look at each carbon. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1: attachments would be Cl, double bond (to C2), CH(CH3), and what else? Wait, no. If the structure is Cl–C(CH3)=CH–CH2, perhaps C1 is attached to Cl, C(CH3), a double bond, and a hydrogen? Wait if the double bond is between C1 and C2, the substituents on each are: C1 would be Cl, a methyl (from 2-methyl), and two bonds to C2. No, actually, for a double bond, each carbon involved is connected by two bonds. So the substituents on C1 would be Cl and CH(CH3), and on C2 would be two groups (maybe a H and a CH2CH3? Not sure). But optical activity isn't from the double bond itself but from chiral centers. So does any of the carbons in this structure have four different substituents? Let me think again.

Assuming the structure is like Cl–C(CH3)=CH2–CH3? That might not fit the but-1-ene part. Wait, perhaps the actual structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But if it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then the chloro is on carbon 1, the double bond is between carbon 1 and 2. So carbon 1 would have Cl, a double bond to C2, a CH2CH2 (I think no). Wait, maybe it's better to write out the full structure. For but-1-ene, the skeleton is CH2=CHCH2CH3. If it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then substituting a chlorine on the first carbon (which is part of the double bond, right?). So that would give Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, that would make the chlorine on a carbon adjacent to the double bond. Hmmm. I'm a bit confused here, but let's suppose that the structure is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which has a double bond with Cl and a methyl group on each carbon. Wait, maybe. The positions are such that C-1 is the first carbon of the double bond. So if the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then the groups on C-1 are Cl and the double bond, and on C-2 are methyl and the double bond. Wait, so in such a case, the structure is Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, not really. If but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, replacing hydrogen on C1 with Cl gives Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond at 1-2? I think I need to clarify this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is Cl attached to C1 and a methyl group on C2, with the double bond between C1 and C2. Then, on C1: Cl, two bonds to C2 (as the double bond), and a CH2 group? Alternatively, maybe it’s (CH2Cl)C(CH3)=CHCH3. This is getting too tangled; maybe another approach. For a compound to have a chiral center, there must be a carbon with four different groups. In the (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, does any carbon have that?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is chloro on C1 and methyl on C2, both on the same carbon of the double bond. Wait, but then double bond may lead to different structures. Let's imagine C=C, with Cl and a methyl on one carbon. Wait, but that's not possible if the double bond is in between. Wait, perhaps (Z) refers to the configuration around the double bond, but unless there are two different groups on each carbon of the double bond, there is no possibility for E/Z isomerism. So maybe if the double bond is between C1 and C2, with Cl and a methyl group on C1, and two other groups on C2. Let me check: For Z isomer, substituents of higher priority on each carbon are on the same side. But regardless, optical activity would require a chiral center. Now, do they have any chiral centers here? Let's suppose C1 has Cl, methyl, and two CH2 groups (as part of the chain). No, perhaps not. Let’s forgo this and maybe check the answer. Alternatively, in such alkenes, sometimes there can be a chiral center if, for example, the substituents are arranged in a way that gives four different groups. But if the groups on either end of the double bond are not creating a chiral center. Let's think, maybe in this compound, there's no chiral center. Because the carbons adjacent to the double bond have substituents that might not be four different. Let's say C1 has Cl, CH(CH3), and then two from the double bond. No, but in a double bond, each carbon is connected via two bonds. So the substituents would be Cl, the methyl, and the two CH2 groups? Not sure. Maybe not a chiral center here, so (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene might not be optically active. Alternatively, maybe because the double bond can make the molecule non-planar? But molecules with double bonds can still be chiral if other centers are present. But perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. So maybe it's not optically active. So likely: no.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Wow, th

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine which compounds are optically active. Optical activity occurs when a molecule has a chiral center and can't be superimposed on its mirror image. Planes of symmetry can eliminate chirality even with stereocenters present. I'll examine each compound individually.

For the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, I need to identify its structure. But-1-ene has the skeleton CH2=CHCH2CH3. When adding 1-chloro and 2-methyl substitutions, I need to identify where these attach. The numbering starts at the double bond, so carbon 1 would have chlorine attached, and carbon 2 would have a methyl group.

I'm struggling with visualizing the exact structure. If but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, then 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene might be ClCH=C(CH3)CH2CH3. The (Z) designation indicates that the higher priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on the same side.

For a molecule to be optically active, it must have a carbon with four different substituents. In this case, I need to check each carbon. For the carbons in the double bond, each is connected to only three groups (since the double bond counts as two bonds to the same atom). The other carbons in the chain also don't appear to have four different substituents.

The double bond creates geometric isomerism (E/Z), but this doesn't necessarily create optical activity. Since I don't see a carbon with four different groups, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is likely not optically active.

Moving to the second compound, (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione, this appears much more complex...

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let me try to determine which of these compounds are optically active. Optical activity occurs when a compound has a chiral center and is not superimposable on its mirror image. Each chiral center can contribute to optical activity, but internal planes of symmetry can negate chirality even if stereocenters are present. Let's evaluate each compound individually.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure should be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But hold on, "but-1-ene" should be structured as CH2=CHCH2CH3. So when we talk about 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, substituting Cl at the position 1 (first carbon of the double bond), the structure should be Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and C1 is linked to Cl and CH(CH3). Does this feature a chiral center? The double bond is indeed between C1 and C2, with C1 having Cl and CH(CH3), but perhaps not—maybe the compound should be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, referring to proper numbering in but-1-ene.

If considering Cl at C1 (with positions 1,2,3,4 in but-1-ene as CH2=CHCH2CH3), placing Cl at C1, which has the double bond connection to C2 and a methyl group, we're not assured of chirality. The double bond, crucial for configuration (Z), requires same-side priority groups; however, our focus is on chirality.

As per the structure, Cl–C(CH3)=CH–CH2 constitutes the layout: positions like C1 attached to Cl, a double bond to C2 with CH3, and CH2. None of these carbons in its structure have four distinct substituents, necessary for chirality.

In short, examining C1 (linked to Cl, C(CH3), double bond, perhaps a CH2) reveals no chiral centers since a double bond connects two carbons through two bonds. Consequently, despite the intricate nature of E/Z notation, a chiral center is absent. Overall, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene lacks a chiral center and, therefore, is not optically active.

Second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Wow, th

Let's parse it. It's a bicyclic compound, with a chloromethylene group (which is like a substituent on a methylene group, possibly as a substituent to the ring). The configuration is given as (3aR,7aS,E). So there are multiple stereocenters here: 3aR and 7aS. Additionally, the chloromethylene group has an E configuration. Given that there are stereocenters (chiral centers) in this compound, which are specified (R and S), this compound would not be a meso compound. Because meso compounds have stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry that makes them achiral. But given the bicyclic structure with specified R and S configurations, which are different (3aR and 7aS), maybe this compound is chiral. Unless there's some symmetry. However, if there's a plane of symmetry that relates these two stereocenters, but given that the configurations are different (one R and one S), maybe they don't cancel out. So, this compound is likely chiral and would exhibit optical activity.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, it's HOOC-C(CH3)H-C(CH3)H-COOH. Now, the configuration is (2R,3S). So these are two adjacent stereocenters. Now, does this compound have a plane of symmetry? If the molecule has an internal plane that mirrors the configurations, making it meso. Let's see: R and S on adjacent carbons. For meso compounds, the presence of a plane of symmetry would mean that the configurations would lead to an internally compensated structure. For example, if there's a plane of symmetry between the two centers. If the substituents are identical on either side. Let me imagine the structure: the succinic acid backbone is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. If the configurations are 2R and 3S, let's analyze the possibility. Let's draw the molecule. The central two carbons each have a methyl group, two carboxyl groups (on adjacent carbons, but the entire molecule would be in a chain: HOOC-CR1-CR2-COOH. Where R1 and R2 are methyl groups. If the configurations are R and S, we can check for internal symmetry.\n\nIf the molecule is viewed from the center, maybe. Let me imagine connecting 2R and 3S. In meso compounds, like meso-tartaric acid, the configurations are R and S, but due to the internal plane of symmetry, the stereocenters cancel each other out. For succinic acid derivative, with two methyl groups, are the substituents arranged such that there's internal symmetry? For instance, if we have (2R,3S), then the arrangement might lead to plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. Let me visualize:\n\nCarboxylic acid groups on both ends. Let's take the two central carbons, each with a methyl. If C2 is R and C3 is S. Let's say, for C2 (looking at its substituents: COOH (high priority), methyl (second?), and two CH groups. Wait, maybe more carefully:\n\nFor C2 in 2R,3S-dimethylsuccinic acid:\n\nThe groups around C2 would be:\n1. Carboxylic acid (from left)\n2. Methyl\n3. Hydrogen\n4. Adjacent carbon (C3)\n\nBut priority-wise, it's: COOH, CH(CH3) (if C3 is attached to a methyl?), no. Wait, maybe need a better approach. For configuration assignment, the priorities would be based on substituents. On C2: substituents are COOH (from left), CH(CH3) (to C3?), H, and the methyl group attached directly to C2. Wait, maybe not. Let's be precise.\n\nSuccinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If we substitute methyl groups on C2 and C3, the molecule becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, for assigning configurations to C2 and C3:\n\nC2: substituents are COOH (priority 1), two CH groups (but adjacent), and the methyl group.\n\nWait maybe in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the two methyl groups are on C2 and C3. Then the structure is:\n\nHOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n\nWait, but succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So substituting a methyl on C2 and C3. Now, the two central carbons each have a methyl.\n\nFor each of these centers, the groups would be:\n\nAt C2:\n\n- COOH (from left, priority 1),\n- CH(CH3) (connected to C3),\n- CH2 (from the original CH2 in succinic acid—no, after substitution, C2 has CH(CH3)),\nWait, actually, substituents would be:\n\nAt C2: the four groups are the two carboxyl groups, but wait, no. Wait, in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, after substitution at C2 and C3 (each with a methyl), the four groups on C2 would be:\n\n1. Carboxyl (OOHC-),\n2. Methyl (CH3),\n3. A carbon (C3 which has its own methyl),\n4. A hydrogen (if the substitution was CH(CH3)).\n\nWait, maybe the correct substituents are:\n\nFor C2: attached to -COOH (left), methyl (CH3), -CH(CH3)- (to C3), and a hydrogen (-H).\n\nSimilarly for C3: attached to -CH(CH3)- (from C2), methyl (CH3), -COOH (right), and a hydrogen.\n\nSo if the configurations are 2R and 3S, then their arrangement would be such that maybe they are mirror images. So this might be a meso compound. For example, if arranging the molecule so that there's a plane of symmetry through the center of the molecule. If C2 is R and C3 is S, and because the groups are mirror images due to the plane, the molecule would be meso. Thus, even though there are stereocenters, it's not chiral. Therefore, this compound would not show optical activity. So the answer is no for this one.\n\nFourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So the same structure as above but now both stereocenters are R. If both C2 and C3 are R, then the molecule is chiral, since there isn't a plane of symmetry. Because when both are R, the configurations are the same, and the molecule cannot be superposed on its mirror image. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. So this one is yes.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on carbon 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration at the alcohol (carbon 1) is R. Now, cyclohexene rings can have axial and equatorial positions, but the key here is whether there's a plane of symmetry. If carbon 1 is a chiral center. Carbon 1 is attached to -OH, the cyclohexene ring (with a double bond at 3-4 maybe). Let me imagine the structure. Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: carbon 1 has the hydroxyl group, and around the ring, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the substituents on carbon 1 would be -OH, two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), and the bridgehead (if it's not part of the double bond). Wait, in cyclohexene, the double bond would be between two carbons. So carbon 1 is OH-substituted, carbons 3 and 4 are double-bonded. So the ring is in a chair-like conformation? Not sure. But the question is: does carbon 1 have four different substituents?\n\nCarbon 1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would be attached to:\n1. The hydroxyl group (-OH),\n2. Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6),\n3. The ring carbon in the bridge (C... wait, perhaps carbon 1 is part of a six-membered ring. Let me number the cyclohexene ring: carbon 1, then 2, 3 (double bond to 4), 5, 6. So carbon 1 is at position 1, and the ring is positioned so the double bond is between 3 and 4.\n\nIn this case, carbon 1 has substituents:\n\n- OH,\n- Two CH2 groups (since in cyclohexene, adjacent carbons will have hydrogens or substituents). Wait, perhaps not. The double bond at 3-4 would make the ring have some different substituents. However, carbon 1 is part of the ring, connected to C2 and C6. If the ring is in a chair, then carbons 1 and 4 are axial.\n\nBut more importantly, the question is whether carbon 1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has four different substituents. The substituents would be the hydroxyl group, two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), and a hydrogen (or maybe another substituent). Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon (except those in the double bond) has two adjacent ring carbons and two hydrogens (assuming no other substituents). Wait, but carbon 1 is bonded to -OH, two ring carbons (C2 and C6), and a hydrogen. Wait, that's four substituents: -OH, C2, C6, and H. But C2 and C6 would be part of the ring.\n\nHowever, if the ring is symmetric around carbon 1, maybe the substituents from C2 and C6 are identical. For example, if the ring is such that C2 and C6 are equivalent. But in a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between 3 and 4, the positions around carbon 1 might not be symmetrical. Let me imagine the cyclohexene ring. Let's label carbons as 1 (with OH), 2, 3 (double bond to 4), 4, 5, 6. So the ring is 1-2-3-4-5-6-1. So carbon 1 is adjacent to 6 and 2. Carbon 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Carbon 3 is double bonded to 4. Carbon 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. Carbon 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Carbon 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1.\n\nNow, looking at carbon 1's substituents:\n\n- OH,\n- C2 (which is CH2, connected to C3),\n- C6 (connected to C5),\n- A hydrogen.\n\nBut the ring may create equivalent environments for C2 and C6. For instance, in a flat ring, C2 and C6 would be mirror images through carbon 1. However, cyclohexene is not flat; it's in a chair or half-chair conformation. However, even if the ring is in a chair, symmetry might mean that C2 and C6 substituents are equivalent. But wait, in any case, if the substituents on C2 and C6 are different due to the double bond? Carbon 3 and 4 are double-bonded. So, the ring is in a chair conformation where the double bond causes some distortion.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of the double bond might reduce symmetry. Let me think whether C2 and C6 are in different environments. For instance, C2 is adjacent to C3 (which is double-bonded to C4), whereas C6 is adjacent to C5, which is next to C4. This might create different substituents. If so, then C2 and C6 are not equivalent, making the substituents around C1: OH, C2 (non-equivalent to C6), C6, and H. That would make four different groups, so a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would be optically active. Since the configuration is given as R, it means it's a chiral center. So (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is chiral and shows optical activity.\n\nSixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration. Wait, actually, in cyclohexane, the positions 1,3,5 are alternating (like a triangle), so they are all on the same face if all are 's' (assuming the stereodescriptors are referring to the axial positions). If all three hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration (all s), which in cyclohexane's chair conformation, if all hydroxyls are axial, but given the numbering (1,3,5), maybe they are symmetrically placed. If all three hydroxyl groups are in axial positions, but in a cyclohexane ring, the 1,3,5-triol with all axial would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, if you have three hydroxyls at 1,3,5 in a cyclohexane ring, each in the s configuration (assuming they are axial), then the molecule has a C3 axis of symmetry. But would it have a plane of symmetry making it meso? Let me think. 1,3,5-Cyclohexanetriol with all substituents axial would be similar to a mer isomer, which can be symmetric. For example, if you have a cyclohexane with three axial OH groups at positions 1,3,5. Due to the symmetry of the molecule (three-fold rotational axis), the molecule would be achiral. Each OH is symmetrically placed, so even though there are three stereocenters, they're all in a symmetric arrangement, leading to an overall achiral molecule. Therefore, the compound is meso or symmetric in such a way that there's a plane of symmetry. Therefore, even with three stereocenters, it's not optically active. So this compound would not show optical activity.\n\nSeventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (which is (R2C=O)) where the carbonyl is at position 1 (so it's pentan-2-one if it were a straight chain, but here it's butan-1-one, which would be (CH2)3-C(=O)-. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is actually not possible since the carbonyl can't be at the end. So I think the correct structure for butan-1-one would be (propan-2-yl)ketone: (CH3)2CO. Wait, wait, maybe the IUPAC name would be pentan-2-one. Wait, confusion here. Let's clarify.\n\nButan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be pentan-2-one. Wait no. Wait, but for butanone, the longest chain with the ketone group is four carbons. So butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, which is pentan-3-one. But maybe the correct name is in question. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me parse the name. The parent chain is butan-1-one. But wait, butan-1-one would have the ketone group at position 1, but butane is four carbons, and ketones require a carbonyl group not at the end. So the correct structure would be pentan-2-one if the carbonyl is in the middle. Wait, maybe the actual structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butan-1-one, but butan-1-one isn't a possible structure. Therefore, this might actually be cyclopentyl-(3-methylbutanoyl). Wait, perhaps it's:\n\nThe structure is (1-cyclopentyl)butan-1-one, with a methyl group on carbon 3. But wait, butan-1-one is not possible as ketones can't be on terminal carbons. So this suggests the name might be in error, but assuming that perhaps it's a typographical error. Maybe it's butan-2-one? If it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-2-one, which would mean the ketone is at position 2 of butane, with a cyclopentyl group on C1 and a methyl on C3. Let's proceed.\n\nBut assuming that the IUPAC name is correct as given. But I think butan-1-one isn't possible, so maybe the correct structure has the ketone at C1 with adjacent groups. Wait, maybe butan-1-one is actually R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3 where R is cyclopentyl. But in that case, the parent chain would be longer? Let's re-express. Alternatively, maybe 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1) of butanone, with a methyl group on C3. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, that makes it a substituted butanone. But how long is the chain? Wait, butanone would be four carbons: C=O is on C2 of a four-carbon chain. If the cyclopentyl is attached to C1 (the first carbon), then numbering would be: C1 (cyclopentyl), C2 (ketone, C=O), C3 (methyl), C4. But in that case, it should be pentan-2-one.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but maybe I just need to consider the presence of a chiral center. Assuming the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1. The adjacent carbon (C2) would be attached to C=O, cyclopentyl, and two methyl groups. Wait, but in this case, perhaps C2 would have substituents such as cyclopentyl, methyl, two others. Wait, let me try to construct:\n\nThe structure would be:\n\nCypentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2?\n\nWait, but the carbonyl is at position 1, so it's more like:\n\nCyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Which would be pentan-2-one substituted. But the ketone is at position 2. Alternatively, butan-1-one isn't a correct name, but perhaps the intended structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. So, if the compound is cyclopentylmethylketone with a methyl branch.\n\nIn any case, the key is if there's a chiral center. Let's analyze. The carbonyl carbon (C=O) cannot be a chiral center because it's double-bonded. The next carbon (alpha carbon) would have substituents: cyclopentyl group (from the ketone), methyl group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. If it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, perhaps:\n\nPositions: The ketone is on C1 (but that's not possible as per IUPAC), so maybe they mean butanone where the ketone is at position 1 (which doesn't exist). Wait, maybe the actual structure is problematic. Let me take another approach. Let's consider the possible chiral centers here. The ketone is (by the name) at position 1, so the only adjacent carbon (alpha) is the cyclopentyl group. Then, the next carbon (beta) would have a methyl. But the alpha carbon here would have maybe the cyclopentyl group, the ketone, and two hydrogens? So that would not be a chiral center. The gamma carbon (if existing) might have a methyl. But in any case, if there are no carbons with four different substituents, then it's not a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl is a substituent on a branch. Perhaps the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl attached to the carbon adjacent to the ketone. So, for example, if the main chain is pentan-2-one (position 2 is the ketone), and there's a cyclopentyl group on carbon 1. Then, carbon 3 (the methyl branch). Let's see:\n\nCarbon 1: cyclopentyl\nCarbon 2: ketone\nCarbon 3: methyl\nCarbon 4 and 5: maybe H's.\n\nBut then the main chain would be longer. This is getting too ambiguous, but regardless, assuming that the structure allows only one carbon (next to the ketone) to have substituents. If that carbon has cyclopentyl, a methyl, and two other groups, perhaps it's a chiral center. For example, if the methyl is on carbon 3, and the cyclopentyl is on carbon 1. But the main chain is still possibly a three-carbon chain (propanone), so not sure. Alternatively, if the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl–C(O)–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3. So it's cyclopentylpropanone with a methyl branch. Then the alpha carbon (attached to the ketone) would be the propanone's alpha carbons. Let's see. The propan-2-one (acetone) is (CH3)2CO. So if there's a cyclopentyl group replacing one of the methyls and a methyl branch elsewhere:\n\nBut this is ambiguous. Let's stick to the question. The key is whether there's a chiral center. If there is a carbon attached to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. Probably, in this compound, assuming that the cyclopentyl group and the methyl are on adjacent carbons. For example, the alpha carbon to the ketone (if ketone is on C1) would have:\n\nBut maybe there's no chiral center. Let's imagine this structure: the cyclopentyl is attached to C1, which is the ketone (C=O). Then C1 is O=C-R (cyclopentyl). The next carbon (C2) might have a methyl and two CH2 groups. So substituents: cyclopentyl, maybe two CH2, and the methyl. So carbon 2 would have CH(CH3)(CH2)(something). Not four different groups. Therefore, no chiral center. Therefore, the compound would not be optically active.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene – likely not active.\n2.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the optical activity of the given compounds, we analyze each for the presence of chiral centers and symmetry elements that might render them meso or achiral.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:  
   This compound lacks a chiral center. The double bond does not introduce chirality, and the substituents do not create a stereogenic center.  
   **Optically Active? No**

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:  
   The explicit stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS) indicate distinct chiral centers without internal symmetry. The E-configuration of the chloromethylene group further prevents planarity of symmetry.  
   **Optically Active? Yes**

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   The (2R,3S) diastereomer is a meso compound. A plane of symmetry through the C2-C3 bond makes the molecule achiral despite the stereocenters.  
   **Optically Active? No**

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   Both stereocenters are R, creating a non-superposable mirror image. No internal symmetry exists, so the compound is chiral.  
   **Optically Active? Yes**

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:  
   Carbon 1 (bearing the -OH group) is a stereogenic center with four distinct substituents. The cyclohexene ring's asymmetry (due to the double bond at C3-C4) ensures no internal plane of symmetry.  
   **Optically Active? Yes**

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:  
   The three hydroxyl groups are symmetrically placed at positions 1, 3, and 5, creating a C3-axis of symmetry. This symmetry eliminates chirality despite the stereocenters.  
   **Optically Active? No**

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:  
   The ketone carbon (C1) is not a stereogenic center (double-bonded to oxygen), and the adjacent carbons lack four distinct substituents. No other chiral centers are present.  
   **Optically Active? No**

**Total optically active compounds**: 2, 4, 5  
**Answer**: \boxed{3}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

t's a complex name. Let's parse it. It's a bicyclic compound, with a chloromethylene group (which is like a substituent on a methylene group, possibly as a substituent to the ring). The configuration is given as (3aR,7aS,E). So there are multiple stereocenters here: 3aR and 7aS. Additionally, the chloromethylene group has an E configuration. Given that there are stereocenters (chiral centers) in this compound, which are specified (R and S), this compound would not be a meso compound. Because meso compounds have stereocenters but also an internal plane of symmetry that makes them achiral. But given the bicyclic structure with specified R and S configurations, which are different (3aR and 7aS), maybe this compound is chiral. Unless there's some symmetry. However, if there's a plane of symmetry that relates these two stereocenters, but given that the configurations are different (one R and one S), maybe they don't cancel out. So, this compound is likely chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, it's HOOC-C(CH3)H-C(CH3)H-COOH. Now, the configuration is (2R,3S). So these are two adjacent stereocenters. Now, does this compound have a plane of symmetry? If the molecule has an internal plane that mirrors the configurations, making it meso. Let's see: R and S on adjacent carbons. For meso compounds, the presence of a plane of symmetry would mean that the configurations would lead to an internally compensated structure. For example, if there's a plane of symmetry between the two centers. If the substituents are identical on either side. Let me imagine the structure: the succinic acid backbone is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. If the configurations are 2R and 3S, let's analyze the possibility. Let's draw the molecule. The central two carbons each have a methyl group, two carboxyl groups (on adjacent carbons, but the entire molecule would be in a chain: HOOC-CR1-CR2-COOH. Where R1 and R2 are methyl groups. If the configurations are R and S, we can check for internal symmetry.

If the molecule is viewed from the center, maybe. Let me imagine connecting 2R and 3S. In meso compounds, like meso-tartaric acid, the configurations are R and S, but due to the internal plane of symmetry, the stereocenters cancel each other out. For succinic acid derivative, with two methyl groups, are the substituents arranged such that there's internal symmetry? For instance, if we have (2R,3S), then the arrangement might lead to plane of symmetry between C2 and C3. Let me visualize:

Carboxylic acid groups on both ends. Let's take the two central carbons, each with a methyl. If C2 is R and C3 is S. Let's say, for C2 (looking at its substituents: COOH (high priority), methyl (second?), and two CH groups. Wait, maybe more carefully:

For C2 in 2R,3S-dimethylsuccinic acid:

The groups around C2 would be:
1. Carboxylic acid (from left)
2. Methyl
3. Hydrogen
4. Adjacent carbon (C3)

But priority-wise, it's: COOH, CH(CH3) (if C3 is attached to a methyl?), no. Wait, maybe need a better approach. For configuration assignment, the priorities would be based on substituents. On C2: substituents are COOH (from left), CH(CH3) (to C3?), H, and the methyl group attached directly to C2. Wait, maybe not. Let's be precise.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If we substitute methyl groups on C2 and C3, the molecule becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, for assigning configurations to C2 and C3:

C2: substituents are COOH (priority 1), two CH groups (but adjacent), and the methyl group.

Wait maybe in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the two methyl groups are on C2 and C3. Then the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH

Wait, but succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So substituting a methyl on C2 and C3. Now, the two central carbons each have a methyl.

For each of these centers, the groups would be:

At C2:

- COOH (from left, priority 1),
- CH(CH3) (connected to C3),
- CH2 (from the original CH2 in succinic acid—no, after substitution, C2 has CH(CH3)),
Wait, actually, substituents would be:

At C2: the four groups are the two carboxyl groups, but wait, no. Wait, in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, after substitution at C2 and C3 (each with a methyl), the four groups on C2 would be:

1. Carboxyl (OOHC-),
2. Methyl (CH3),
3. A carbon (C3 which has its own methyl),
4. A hydrogen (if the substitution was CH(CH3)).

Wait, maybe the correct substituents are:

For C2: attached to -COOH (left), methyl (CH3), -CH(CH3)- (to C3), and a hydrogen (-H).

Similarly for C3: attached to -CH(CH3)- (from C2), methyl (CH3), -COOH (right), and a hydrogen.

So if the configurations are 2R and 3S, then their arrangement would be such that maybe they are mirror images. So this might be a meso compound. For example, if arranging the molecule so that there's a plane of symmetry through the center of the molecule. If C2 is R and C3 is S, and because the groups are mirror images due to the plane, the molecule would be meso. Thus, even though there are stereocenters, it's not chiral. Therefore, this compound would not show optical activity. So the answer is no for this one.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So the same structure as above but now both stereocenters are R. If both C2 and C3 are R, then the molecule is chiral, since there isn't a plane of symmetry. Because when both are R, the configurations are the same, and the molecule cannot be superposed on its mirror image. Therefore, this compound would be optically active. So this one is yes.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on carbon 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration at the alcohol (carbon 1) is R. Now, cyclohexene rings can have axial and equatorial positions, but the key here is whether there's a plane of symmetry. If carbon 1 is a chiral center. Carbon 1 is attached to -OH, the cyclohexene ring (with a double bond at 3-4 maybe). Let me imagine the structure. Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: carbon 1 has the hydroxyl group, and around the ring, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the substituents on carbon 1 would be -OH, two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), and the bridgehead (if it's not part of the double bond). Wait, in cyclohexene, the double bond would be between two carbons. So carbon 1 is OH-substituted, carbons 3 and 4 are double-bonded. So the ring is in a chair-like conformation? Not sure. But the question is: does carbon 1 have four different substituents?

Carbon 1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would be attached to:
1. The hydroxyl group (-OH),
2. Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6),
3. The ring carbon in the bridge (C... wait, perhaps carbon 1 is part of a six-membered ring. Let me number the cyclohexene ring: carbon 1, then 2, 3 (double bond to 4), 5, 6. So carbon 1 is at position 1, and the ring is positioned so the double bond is between 3 and 4.

In this case, carbon 1 has substituents:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (since in cyclohexene, adjacent carbons will have hydrogens or substituents). Wait, perhaps not. The double bond at 3-4 would make the ring have some different substituents. However, carbon 1 is part of the ring, connected to C2 and C6. If the ring is in a chair, then carbons 1 and 4 are axial.

But more importantly, the question is whether carbon 1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has four different substituents. The substituents would be the hydroxyl group, two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), and a hydrogen (or maybe another substituent). Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon (except those in the double bond) has two adjacent ring carbons and two hydrogens (assuming no other substituents). Wait, but carbon 1 is bonded to -OH, two ring carbons (C2 and C6), and a hydrogen. Wait, that's four substituents: -OH, C2, C6, and H. But C2 and C6 would be part of the ring.

However, if the ring is symmetric around carbon 1, maybe the substituents from C2 and C6 are identical. For example, if the ring is such that C2 and C6 are equivalent. But in a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between 3 and 4, the positions around carbon 1 might not be symmetrical. Let me imagine the cyclohexene ring. Let's label carbons as 1 (with OH), 2, 3 (double bond to 4), 4, 5, 6. So the ring is 1-2-3-4-5-6-1. So carbon 1 is adjacent to 6 and 2. Carbon 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Carbon 3 is double bonded to 4. Carbon 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. Carbon 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Carbon 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1.

Now, looking at carbon 1's substituents:

- OH,
- C2 (which is CH2, connected to C3),
- C6 (connected to C5),
- A hydrogen.

But the ring may create equivalent environments for C2 and C6. For instance, in a flat ring, C2 and C6 would be mirror images through carbon 1. However, cyclohexene is not flat; it's in a chair or half-chair conformation. However, even if the ring is in a chair, symmetry might mean that C2 and C6 substituents are equivalent. But wait, in any case, if the substituents on C2 and C6 are different due to the double bond? Carbon 3 and 4 are double-bonded. So, the ring is in a chair conformation where the double bond causes some distortion.

Alternatively, the presence of the double bond might reduce symmetry. Let me think whether C2 and C6 are in different environments. For instance, C2 is adjacent to C3 (which is double-bonded to C4), whereas C6 is adjacent to C5, which is next to C4. This might create different substituents. If so, then C2 and C6 are not equivalent, making the substituents around C1: OH, C2 (non-equivalent to C6), C6, and H. That would make four different groups, so a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would be optically active. Since the configuration is given as R, it means it's a chiral center. So (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is chiral and shows optical activity.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5, all in the s configuration. Wait, actually, in cyclohexane, the positions 1,3,5 are alternating (like a triangle), so they are all on the same face if all are 's' (assuming the stereodescriptors are referring to the axial positions). If all three hydroxyl groups are in the same configuration (all s), which in cyclohexane's chair conformation, if all hydroxyls are axial, but given the numbering (1,3,5), maybe they are symmetrically placed. If all three hydroxyl groups are in axial positions, but in a cyclohexane ring, the 1,3,5-triol with all axial would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, if you have three hydroxyls at 1,3,5 in a cyclohexane ring, each in the s configuration (assuming they are axial), then the molecule has a C3 axis of symmetry. But would it have a plane of symmetry making it meso? Let me think. 1,3,5-Cyclohexanetriol with all substituents axial would be similar to a mer isomer, which can be symmetric. For example, if you have a cyclohexane with three axial OH groups at positions 1,3,5. Due to the symmetry of the molecule (three-fold rotational axis), the molecule would be achiral. Each OH is symmetrically placed, so even though there are three stereocenters, they're all in a symmetric arrangement, leading to an overall achiral molecule. Therefore, the compound is meso or symmetric in such a way that there's a plane of symmetry. Therefore, even with three stereocenters, it's not optically active. So this compound would not show optical activity.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (which is (R2C=O)) where the carbonyl is at position 1 (so it's pentan-2-one if it were a straight chain, but here it's butan-1-one, which would be (CH2)3-C(=O)-. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is actually not possible since the carbonyl can't be at the end. So I think the correct structure for butan-1-one would be (propan-2-yl)ketone: (CH3)2CO. Wait, wait, maybe the IUPAC name would be pentan-2-one. Wait, confusion here. Let's clarify.

Butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be pentan-2-one. Wait no. Wait, but for butanone, the longest chain with the ketone group is four carbons. So butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, which is pentan-3-one. But maybe the correct name is in question. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let me parse the name. The parent chain is butan-1-one. But wait, butan-1-one would have the ketone group at position 1, but butane is four carbons, and ketones require a carbonyl group not at the end. So the correct structure would be pentan-2-one if the carbonyl is in the middle. Wait, maybe the actual structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butan-1-one, but butan-1-one isn't a possible structure. Therefore, this might actually be cyclopentyl-(3-methylbutanoyl). Wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is (1-cyclopentyl)butan-1-one, with a methyl group on carbon 3. But wait, butan-1-one is not possible as ketones can't be on terminal carbons. So this suggests the name might be in error, but assuming that perhaps it's a typographical error. Maybe it's butan-2-one? If it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-2-one, which would mean the ketone is at position 2 of butane, with a cyclopentyl group on C1 and a methyl on C3. Let's proceed.

But assuming that the IUPAC name is correct as given. But I think butan-1-one isn't possible, so maybe the correct structure has the ketone at C1 with adjacent groups. Wait, maybe butan-1-one is actually R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3 where R is cyclopentyl. But in that case, the parent chain would be longer? Let's re-express. Alternatively, maybe 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1) of butanone, with a methyl group on C3. So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, that makes it a substituted butanone. But how long is the chain? Wait, butanone would be four carbons: C=O is on C2 of a four-carbon chain. If the cyclopentyl is attached to C1 (the first carbon), then numbering would be: C1 (cyclopentyl), C2 (ketone, C=O), C3 (methyl), C4. But in that case, it should be pentan-2-one.

This is getting complicated, but maybe I just need to consider the presence of a chiral center. Assuming the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1. The adjacent carbon (C2) would be attached to C=O, cyclopentyl, and two methyl groups. Wait, but in this case, perhaps C2 would have substituents such as cyclopentyl, methyl, two others. Wait, let me try to construct:

The structure would be:

Cypentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2?

Wait, but the carbonyl is at position 1, so it's more like:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Which would be pentan-2-one substituted. But the ketone is at position 2. Alternatively, butan-1-one isn't a correct name, but perhaps the intended structure is cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. So, if the compound is cyclopentylmethylketone with a methyl branch.

In any case, the key is if there's a chiral center. Let's analyze. The carbonyl carbon (C=O) cannot be a chiral center because it's double-bonded. The next carbon (alpha carbon) would have substituents: cyclopentyl group (from the ketone), methyl group, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. If it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, perhaps:

Positions: The ketone is on C1 (but that's not possible as per IUPAC), so maybe they mean butanone where the ketone is at position 1 (which doesn't exist). Wait, maybe the actual structure is problematic. Let me take another approach. Let's consider the possible chiral centers here. The ketone is (by the name) at position 1, so the only adjacent carbon (alpha) is the cyclopentyl group. Then, the next carbon (beta) would have a methyl. But the alpha carbon here would have maybe the cyclopentyl group, the ketone, and two hydrogens? So that would not be a chiral center. The gamma carbon (if existing) might have a methyl. But in any case, if there are no carbons with four different substituents, then it's not a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl is a substituent on a branch. Perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl attached to the carbon adjacent to the ketone. So, for example, if the main chain is pentan-2-one (position 2 is the ketone), and there's a cyclopentyl group on carbon 1. Then, carbon 3 (the methyl branch). Let's see:

Carbon 1: cyclopentyl
Carbon 2: ketone
Carbon 3: methyl
Carbon 4 and 5: maybe H's.

But then the main chain would be longer. This is getting too ambiguous, but regardless, assuming that the structure allows only one carbon (next to the ketone) to have substituents. If that carbon has cyclopentyl, a methyl, and two other groups, perhaps it's a chiral center. For example, if the methyl is on carbon 3, and the cyclopentyl is on carbon 1. But the main chain is still possibly a three-carbon chain (propanone), so not sure. Alternatively, if the structure is:

Cyclopentyl–C(O)–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3. So it's cyclopentylpropanone with a methyl branch. Then the alpha carbon (attached to the ketone) would be the propanone's alpha carbons. Let's see. The propan-2-one (acetone) is (CH3)2CO. So if there's a cyclopentyl group replacing one of the methyls and a methyl branch elsewhere:

But this is ambiguous. Let's stick to the question. The key is whether there's a chiral center. If there is a carbon attached to four different groups, then it's a chiral center. Probably, in this compound, assuming that the cyclopentyl group and the methyl are on adjacent carbons. For example, the alpha carbon to the ketone (if ketone is on C1) would have:

But maybe there's no chiral center. Let's imagine this structure: the cyclopentyl is attached to C1, which is the ketone (C=O). Then C1 is O=C-R (cyclopentyl). The next carbon (C2) might have a methyl and two CH2 groups. So substituents: cyclopentyl, maybe two CH2, and the methyl. So carbon 2 would have CH(CH3)(CH2)(something). Not four different groups. Therefore, no chiral center. Therefore, the compound would not be optically active.

Putting it all together:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene – likely not active.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... – chiral centers, no symmetry – active.
3. (2R,3S)-... – meso compound – not active.
4. (2R,3R)-... – chiral – active.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol – chiral – active.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-... – symmetric – not active.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one – no chiral center – not active.

So total of active compounds: 2,4,5. So 3 compounds.

The fact that it has specified stereochemistry (3aR,7aS,E) already implies the presence of chirality. The (E) configuration refers to the chloromethylene group. Even with the complex structure, as long as there are chiral centers (like 3aR and 7aS), and no internal planes of symmetry, this compound should be optically active. So this one probably is active.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOCCH2CH2COOH. If it\'s 2,3-dimethyl, substituents on carbons 2 and 3. So HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH. The configuration is 2R and 3S. Considering these stereocenters: each of carbons 2 and 3 has COOH, CH3, CH2, and another CH as substituents. Wait, maybe?\n\nWait, the structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH?\n\nBut wait, the parent chain would be four carbons for succinic acid (HOOCCH2CH2COOH). If it\'s 2,3-dimethyl, then carbons 2 and 3 each have methyl groups. The actual structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Then each of the central carbons (2 and 3) should have substituents: two COOH groups on each? Wait, the two COOH would be at the ends (carbons 1 and 4). Let me clarify.\n\nSuccinic acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H. So numbering from the left: carbon 1 (COOH), carbon 2 (CH2), carbon 3 (CH2), carbon 4 (COOH). Then 2,3-dimethyl would add a methyl to carbons 2 and 3. So carbon 2 becomes CH(CH3), carbon 3 becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.\n\nCarbon 2 has substituents: COOH (from C1), CH3, CH(CH3) (to C3), and a hydrogen. Wait, carbon 2 is attached to:\n\nPrevious carbon (C1: COOH), then three bonds: CH(CH3), then next carbon (C3: CH(CH3)), and a hydrogen. Wait, actually, carbons 2 and 3 are each CH(CH3). Let\'s consider the structure again.\n\nEach of carbons 2 and 3 would be attached to:\n\nFor carbon 2: groups are:\n\n- COOH (from C1?)\n\nNo, wait, carbon 1 is COOH, connected via a CH- group. Carbon 1 would be COOH-CH2-CH2-COOH. If this becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then carbon 2 is CH(CH3), attached to COOH (C1), the methyl group, the adjacent C3 (which is also CH(CH3)), and a hydrogen? Similarly for carbon 3.\n\nWait, carbons 2 and 3 each have a CH(CH3), right? Therefore, for each of these carbons, substituents would be:\n\n- Adjacent carbon (either C1 or C4)\n\nWait, maybe the substituents would be for Carbon 2:\n\nLeft group: COOH (from C1), right group: C3 (CH(CH3)), methyl group, and a hydrogen?\n\nWait, yes. So if Carbon 2 has a COOH group (from the chain), a CH3 group, a CH(CH3) from Carbon 3, and a hydrogen, then substituents are COOH, CH3, CH(CH3), and H. No, actually, when you\'re looking at substituents on the stereocenter, it\'s the four groups directly attached.\n\nCarbon 2: connected to:\n\n- C1: this is a CH2 group with a COOH at the end. But in this case, perhaps it\'s actually carbon 2 as CH(CH3) connected to COO- ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should draw the actual structure.\n\nOriginal succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. 2,3-dimethyl would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of Carbons 2 and 3 is CH(CH3).\n\nTherefore, substituents on Carbon 2: the carboxylic acid (from C1), a methyl group, the adjacent CH(CH3) (Carbon 3 with its substituents), and the other substituent is... wait, Carbon 2 is a central carbon that is CH(CH3), but actually, because it\'s a chain of four carbons, the substituents would be:\n\nWait, carbon 2 is the second carbon. If the structure is:\n\n1: COOH (on C1)\n\n2: CH(CH3) connected to C1 and C3\n\n3: CH(CH3) connected to C2 and C4\n\n4: COOH (on C4)\n\nTherefore, Carbon 2\'s substituents are:\n\n- A single bond to C1 (which is carbon 1, which has COOH)... but when considering substituents on carbon 2, he\'s directly connected to three groups: one is the methyl group (CH3), another is the group towards C1 (which is a CH2 group leading to the COOH?), wait, maybe not. Maybe the actual substituents are:\n\nIf Carbon 2 is CH(CH3), its substituents would be:\n\n1. The group from C1, which is a CH2 group (since Carbon 1 is COO-C. Wait, let me model this more accurately.\n\nWait, the original compound is 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, so:\n\nSuccinic acid is: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH\n\nAfter adding methyl groups on carbons 2 and 3:\n\nHOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH\n\nSo each CH2 becomes a CH(CH3). Now, look at each of these carbons (carbons 2 and 3). For each one, the substituents would be attached as:\n\nOn Carbon 2: connected groups are:\n\n- The COOH at the end (two carbons away), but the immediate substituents are: the adjacent Carbon 1 is connected via a single bond. But no, in between C1 and C2 is a single bond, but C1 is actually COOHCH2.\n\nWait, confusion arises. Let me reconsider:\n\nCarbon 1 is the first carbonyl carbon (COOH), so the structure would be:\n\nCOOH (C1) - CH(CH3) (C2) - CH(CH3) (C3) - COOH (C4)\n\nWait, no: COOH is attached to carbon 1 and carbon 4. Each carbon 2 and 3 has CH(CH3). So C1 is COOH, then CH(CH3)-CH(CH3), then COOH.\n\nTherefore, Carbon 2: adjacent groups are: C1 (which is a COO- group attached via a CH, but wait. Let me represent it step by step.\n\nThe structure is HOOC - CH(CH3) - CH(CH3) - COOH. So the chain is four carbons: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH(CH3)), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (COOH).\n\nThus, Carbon 2 is CH(CH3). The substituents on Carbon 2 are:\n\n- Two CH groups (since between the COOH and Carbon 2 is a single bond, hence substituents):\n\nWait, Carbon 2 substituents would actually be:\n\n1. The left group is a -COOH attached to C1, but Carbon 2 itself is a central carbon. No, wait structurally, Carbon 2 is connected directly to three groups: COO group is attached to C1, but the actual bonds on Carbon 2 are:\n\nWait, sorr for confusion. Maybe a better approach: each Carbon 2 in this chain has four substituents:\n\nFor Carbon 2: substituents are:\n\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n- A hydrogen (even if not shown)\n- The chaining carbon C1, which is connected to the COOH. So the group from C1 is a -CH(COOH) structure. Wait, perhaps that\'s not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps here\'s the bonding:\n\nEach of the middle carbons (2 and 3) are connected to:\n\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n- Two other adjacent carbons (C1 and C3 for Carbon 2; C2 and C4 for Carbon 3)\n- And a hydrogen atom.\n\nTherefore, each may have the substituents:\n\nCarbon 2: -CH(CH3)-\n\nConnected to:\n\n- To one side: a COOH group (through Carbon 1)\n\nWait, I\'m getting stuck here. Another angle: substituent groups. For each stereogenic center (chiral center), the four substituents must be different.\n\nPhotosuccinic acid is 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid, but here we have 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, which is 2,3-dimethylbutanedioic acid.\n\nCarbon 2 and 3 each have a methyl group and three other groups. So apart from the methyl group at carbons 2 and 3, each must be connected to:\n\n- Carboxylic acid groups?\n\nActually, Carbon 2 is in the middle: connected to Carbon 1 (which has a COOH group) and Carbon 3 (which has the other CH(CH3)), and Carbon 4 (COOH). Wait, perhaps not. Carbon 2 is connected thus: HOOC-CH(CH3)-. So each of the central carbons (2 and 3) is a CH(CH3), which themselves link the two COOH groups.\n\nSo for Carbon 2 (in 2R,3S), substituents would be:\n\n1. The COOH group on the left (from Carbon 1)\n2. The methyl group\n3. The adjacent CH(CH3) at Carbon 3\n4. A hydrogen atom?\n\nWait, perhaps the substituents for Carbon 2 are:\n\n- -COOH (from C1)\n- -CH(CH3) (its own methyl)\n- -CH(CH3) (from C3)\n- ???\n\nWait, Carbon 2 can only have substituents directly attached to it. Thus, substituents would be:\n\n- One CH3 (methyl group)\n- Two CH groups (next to each other: C1 and C3)\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nWait, perhaps the groups are as follows:\n\nCarbon 1: COOH–CH(CH3) where the CH(CH3) is Carbon 2. Then Carbon 2 is attached to:\n\n- COOH (as part of Carbon 1)\n- CH(CH3) (as the central Carbon attached to Carbon 3)\n- A methyl group (-CH3)\n- And a hydrogen (H)\n\nWait, that gives four substituents: a COOH-connected chain (maybe a -CH2 for C1 but this is confusing). Alternatively, Carbon 2 is a CH group with substituents:\n\nWait, if Carbon 2 has groups:\n\n1. The two parts of the chain: toward C1 (which is –COOH–CH2–) is becoming –COOH–CH(CH3)– but the actual bonds are:\n\nThe structure probably is HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH.\n\nThus, each carbon 2 and 3 are each –CH(CH3)-, and the HOOC and COOH are on the ends. Now, in such a structure, each –CH(CH3) is connected to two CH groups (since adjacent to carbons with only two carbons each?), or ?\n\nAlternatively, let\'s orient Carbon 2 and Carbon 3 each as such:\n\nCarbon 2: adjacent to COOH on one side and Carbon 3 on the other. Each has a methyl group and whether the four substituents are different.\n\nFor Carbon 2: the four substituents would be:\n\n1. The chain towards COOH (so a -CH2- group leading to COOH? Wait. Wait, the actual structure is:\n\nC1: COOH\n\nC2: CH(CH3)\n\nC3: CH(CH3)\n\nC4: COOH\n\nBut the chain is between C1 and C2 is a single bond. So for Carbon 2, substituents are:\n\n- COO- (from C1)\n- methyl group (-CH3)\n- -CH(CH3)- (C3)\n- Hydrogen\n\nWait, no: Each Carbon 2 is connected directly to:\n\n- C1 (which is COOH attached to a CH2? No, probably not. Wait, actually, the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So Carbon 2 is actually the first CH(CH3) connected to the COOH at the left. Carbon 2\'s substituents would be:\n\n- The COOH group (from the left), which is adjacent via the C1 carbon (which is a carboxylic acid group, so maybe for Carbon 2: the substituent is a -COOH-CH2-group? Wait, maybe again, visualize bonding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this molecule has two stereocenters: Carbon 2 and Carbon 3. If that\'s the case, then both having methyl groups and four substituents. But in order to have four different groups, they must each be attached to four distinct groups.\n\nAssuming the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then each of Carbon 2 and Carbon 3 would have:\n\nSubstituents:\n\n1. COOH (at one end or through a chain)\n2. COOH at the other end or through a chain\n3. Methyl group\n4. Hydrogen\n\nBut perhaps in actuality, Carbon 2\'s substituents are:\n\n- The left COOH (actually via a CH chain? Maybe Carbon 1, but Carbon 1 is part of the COOH group attached to C2). Wait, here\'s a more precise structure: HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH, so each CH(CH3) is connected to the adjacent carbons:\n\nSo the actual substituents on Carbon 2 are:\n\n- COO- group (OOCR, from the left),\n- A methyl group (CH3),\n- A CH group (from Carbon 3 with its substituents), and\n- A hydrogen.\n\nSimilarly for Carbon 3.\n\nBut this would mean that each has four different substituents. Wait, but are these groups distinct?\n\nIf both carbons (2 and 3) are CH(CH3), then for Carbon 2, substituents are:\n\n- Left group: COOH connected via a single bond (that’s the OOCR group)\n- Right group: CH(CH3) (the next carbon)\n- Methyl group (CH3)\n- A hydrogen (H)\n\nBut are the left and right groups different?\n\nCarbon 2 is linked to Carbon 1 (via a single bond: CH(CH3)-COOH) and Carbon 3 (via a single bond to another CH(CH3)). So substituent groups on Carbon 2:\n\nGroups on C2 would be:\n\n- COOH, (but attached through a single bond to Carbon 1: so the actual substituents in that direction are a -OOC–CH2 group? Not exactly.\n\nPerhaps considering the substituents as:\n\n- Two single bonds to carbons (C1 and C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. If C1 and C3 have different substituents, then substituents on C2 would be different.\n\nWait, no, if Carbon 1 is COOH-CH(CH3)-, then Carbon 1 is part of the COOH group. But how is Carbon 2 connected? Wait, Carbon 1 in succinic acid is a carbon adjacent to COOH.\n\nMaybe I need to find the actual IUPAC structure. For succinic acid (butanedioic acid), the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, the name "2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid" implies the two methyl groups are on the second and third carbons of the succinic acid chain. Hence, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.\n\nIn that case, the two central carbons (2 and 3) are each bonded to:\n\n- Two carboxylic acid groups (through the chain, not directly)\n- Two methyl groups\nWait, no. Each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) now have methyl groups and other substituents.\n\nOn each of these carbons, the substituents are as follows:\n\nFor C2:\n\n- Methyl group (CH3)\n- Adjacent to carbon 1: which is linked to COOH (so, the substituent group here is a -CH2–COOH if there\'s no substitution, but since it\'s substituted, becomes -CH(CH3)). Wait, perhaps I need to break it down:\n\nIn the original chain (unsubstituted): Carbon 1 is COOH, Carbon 2 is CH2, Carbon 3 is CH2, Carbon 4 is COOH.\n\nWith substitution at C2 and C3 as methyl groups: Carbon 2 becomes CH(CH3), Carbon 3 becomes CH(CH3).\n\nSo the central chain is HOOC–C(CH3)–C(CH3)–COOH. The substituents on C2, for example, would be: one methyl (CH3), the adjacent C(CH3) (Carbon 3), the COOH group (via Carbon 1?), and perhaps a hydrogen.\n\nWait, but when you actually look at the substituents attached directly to C2, they would be:\n\nFour substituents:\n\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n- A single bond to Carbon 1 (which is part of the COOH group)\n- A single bond to Carbon 3 (which is also a CH(CH3))\n- A hydrogen atom\n\nBut wait, perhaps Carbon 2\'s substituents are:\n\n- CH3 (methyl)\n- Two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3)\n- Hydrogen\n\nSo only three bonds. Wait, but each carbon in the chain has four bonds. Carbon 2 would be connected to:\n\n- Carbon 1 (COOH group via CH)\n- Carbon 3 (CH(CH3))\n- A methyl group (CH3)\n- A hydrogen (H)\n\nTherefore, substituents on C2 are:\n\n-CH2(COOH) group (via carbon 1?), wait, not exactly. Wait, Carbon 1 is COOH, so Carbon 1 is spelled out as COOH-C... but in this case, Carbon 1 (HOOC-CH... ) So the actual substituent is a -CH2- group attached to COOH?\n\nI think I\'m getting stuck here, but perhaps the conclusion is that the carbons connected to two methyl groups and other groups would have four different substituents. Specifically, since each of carbons 2 and 3 has two methyl groups and different substituents, but in reality, if the two substituents next to methyl are mirror images, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry.\n\nWait, let\'s consider meso compounds. Dimethylsuccinic acid might be similar to tartaric acid. If both stereocenters are R and S, that could lead to a meso compound, which is not optically active.\n\nIn the given compound (2R,3S), would that make it meso? Let\'s see.\n\nTartaric acid has 2,3-dihydroxy with (R,R) and (S,S) being enantiomers and (R,S) being meso.\n\nSimilarly, if we have 2R,3S-dimethylsuccinic acid. If carbons 2 and 3 are each a stereocenter with opposite configurations, then there would be an internal plane of symmetry. Hence, the compound would be meso and thus not optically active.\n\nWait, let\'s proceed step by step.\n\nIf the configuration of carbons in 2 and 3 is opposite (R and S), then looking at whether a plane of symmetry exists. Whether mirroring across the center would produce the same molecule. For succinic acid derivatives with substituents in 2 and 3-positions in opposing configurations, check meso forms.\n\nFor instance, the molecule HOOC-CR(CH3)-CS(CH3)-COOH... if there\'s an internal plane of symmetry between the two stereocenters then it\'s meso and hence achiral. For example, in tartaric acid, the (2R,3S) would be a meso compound. Similarly here, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, if such a plane exists, is meso and not chiral. Hence, non-optically active.\n\nBut the question is about (2R,3S) versus (2R,3R). So for the third compound: (2R,3S). If it\'s meso, then no optical activity. The fourth compound is (2R,3R), which would have same configuration on both centers, meaning no plane of symmetry – hence, it\'s chiral and optically active.\n\nSo third compound: (2R,3S) = meso, not active.\n\nFourth compound: (2R,3R) = active.\n\nShoot, the third and fourth compounds are thus differing: the third would be meso, so not active; the fourth would not be meso (both R), making it active.\n\nThen moving on, fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.\n\nChecking if the cyclohexene ring with alcohol group at 1 and double bond at 3 has a chiral center. Since it\'s specified as R configuration, that carbon (1) must have four different groups. Let\'s model this structure.\n\nCyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4 (since numbering starts from the alcohol group which is at position 1. So with OH on C1, double bond between C3 and C4. The chiral center would be C1. Let\'s see what substituents C1 has.\n\n- The cyclohexene ring is fused: considering C1, connected to two adjacent ring Carbons (C2 and C6), an OH group, and a hydrogen.\n\nBut wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1 would be:\n\n- C2 (ring)\n- C6 (ring)\n- OH\n- And the bridgehead structure (a bridge if any). Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. For cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the alcohol is on C1, and double bond between C3-C4.\n\nBut in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So for C1: substituents would be connected to C2 and C6, the OH group, and the ring junction. However, in a chair-like conformation or something else, unless there is a bridge, it\'s a regular cyclohexene ring.\n\nBut for C1 to be a chiral center, the four substituents attached to it must be different. The substituents would be:\n\n- OH\n- C2 (which is part of the ring)\n- C6 (which is part of the ring)\n- And the ring atom?\n\nWait, no. Structure: the ring is cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with a double bond. The hydroxyl is on C1. So the four substituents on C1 are:\n\n- Adjacent Carbons (C2 and C6)\n- OH group\n- A hydrogen (H)\n\nBut, wait, in such a ring, the C1 would be connected to three ring carbons (two neighbors and one other)? No, each carbon in the cyclohexene ring is only connected to two neighboring carbons and two substituents, right? Wait, standard cyclohexene structure: each carbon has two substituents (maybe hydrogen or other groups).\n\nWait, the alcohol in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would be on C1. So C1 is analogous to a chair position. If the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, the chair conformation is less critical here. The question is whether C1 has four different substituents.\n\nTo have a chiral center, C1 should have four different groups: OH, H, and two different ring substituents. But in a cyclohexene ring, would C1 have substituents symmetrically?\n\nWait, for example, if cyclohexene is in a chair, then C1, when it has an OH group, would have substituents: OH, H, and two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), right? But the ring is connected such that C2 and C6 may have similar environments, making them equivalent.\n\nIf the ring has a double bond from C3-C4, then that could create some asymmetry. However, depending on the positioning of substituents.\n\nBut if the ring is unsymmetrical due to the double bond, the groups attached to C1 could differ. For instance, C2 would be adjacent to the double bond. Depending on the confirmation, whether the substituents around C1 create four distinct groups.\n\nBut let\'s think in terms of substituents on the ring:\n\nCekurueer. C1 has:\n\n- OH\n\n- H\n\n- Two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). Now, these two will be in different positions due to the double bond.\n\nCarbon 3 and 4 have a double bond, so C3 is connected to C2 and C4 (double bond), and C4 is connected to C3 (double), C5. Carbon 5 is connected to C4 and C6. C6 is connected to C5 and C1.\n\nIf we consider that the double bond creates an unsymmetrical structure, then C2 and C6 might not be equivalent. Let\'s picture this:\n\nBut the key is whether the two ring carbon substituents on C1 are equivalent or not. If the ring is asymmetric due to the double bond, C1\'s connections to C2 and C6 might lead to different substituents.\n\nAlternatively, since the double bond creates a different environment for C2 and C6. For instance, C2 is adjacent to C3 (part of the double bond), while C6 is adjacent to C5 and C1. But even so, the substituents to criteria for a chiral center would be the groups attached to C1.\n\nWait, in the chair form, maybe, but cyclohexene typically isn\'t a flat ring, so the substituents (OH, C2, C6, and H) might all be different. Thus, if C1 has those four distinct groups, then the (R)-configuration would make it chiral and hence optically active.\n\nHowever, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Let\'s imagine. If the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, then looking at the substituents on C1:\n\nC1: OH group, H, and two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). Now, how do the positions of the double bond affect the substituents on C1?\n\nIf the double bond is between C3-C4, then C2 is connected to C3 (which is part of the double bond). The other features of the ring (like substituents) might make the surrounding groups on C1 different.\n\nAlternatively, it\'s possible that the ring\'s geometry inherently makes C2 and C6 nonequivalent, leading to a chiral center at C1.\n\nSince the problem specifies the configuration as (R), they must consider C1 to be a chiral center; thereby, the compound is optically active. So the fifth compound is active.\n\nThe sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.\n\nTriol with all three hydroxyl groups in same positions but same substituents. Looking for symmetry here. Cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at 1,3,5-positions in s-configuration.\n\nWait, when substituents on cyclohexane are at 1,3,5 positions all axial or equatorial. But if all are s-configuration, that would typically be all axial or all with a certain configuration. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with three hydroxyl groups arranged symmetrically. Since 1,3,5 are opposites of each other, the arrangement would form a symmetric structure (like 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, which is a symmetric compound, hence meso, achiral).\n\nIf substitutions on 1,3,5 cyclohexane (which are mirror positions) if in the same configuration, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Hence, even with stereocenters, the overall molecule could be achiral.\n\nExample: 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, if three methyl groups are all in axial positions, there would be planes of symmetry making the entire structure achiral, hence no optical activity. Similarly, for a triol in the same positions, if all substituents are in the same configuration (all R or all S), but due to the symmetry, they might cancel out any chirality.\n\nBut in terms of each substituent, each Carbon (1,3,5) has an OH group and other substituents. To analyze chirality:\n\nIf each of these positions (1,3,5) on the cyclohexane ring are stereocenters, whether each has four different substituents.\n\nHowever, cyclohexane rings are typically more conducive to this analysis. So each OH would be in an equatorial or axial position.\n\nBut for a chiral center, each substituent would need four different groups attached. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, each OH is at carbons 1,3,5. The rest of the substituents are hydrogen and two adjacent carbons.\n\nBut wait, each of these carbons (1,3,5) would have substituents:\n\n- OH\n- Two adjacent carbons (on the ring)\n- One hydrogen (assuming that the other substituents are all Hs). However, that would make three identical (two ring carbons and perhaps a hydrogen). Alternatively, each contains an OH and three other groups (adjacent ring carbons and two hydrogens?), which wouldn\'t create a stereocenter.\n\nWait, COFUSED...\n\nNo, even sophomorically, each carbon in the cyclohexane ring is CH2, unless substituted. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol would have three -OH groups on carbons 1,3,5. So those carbons would be COH groups. The other substituents.\n\nFor example, carbon 1 would have:\n\n- OH\n- Two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6)\n- One hydrogen\n\nSimilarly, if for carbons 1,3,5. Given that the molecule is cyclohexane (all single bonds), substituents on these carbons would be OH, H, and two adjacent CH2\'s.\n\nThus, each stereocenter (i.e. carbon with OH) would have four different groups: OH, H, (CH2 leading to C2 and to C6). But in a chair conformation, perhaps the substituents adjacent are different.\n\nBut each carbon with OH would have:\n\n- Up: OH\n- Down: H\n- Adjacent carbons: but in cyclohexane, the adjacent carbons are connected via CH2 groups. Wait, isn\'t cyclohexane composed of six equivalents of CH2 groups?\n\nWait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, each carbon attached to two other carbons. So normally, each carbon has two CH2 groups.\n\nHowever, if we use fixed positions for substituents, the substituent (OH) is part of the half-chair. But perhaps the problem is that if substituents are in the axial vs equatorial positions, this can create distinct groups.\n\nBut unless other substituents are on the carbons, maybe we can\'t create chirality.\n\nWait, for a cyclohexane ring with three substituents (OHs at 1,3,5). If all three are in a equatorial positions, then each carbon (1,3,5) would instead have substituents:\n\nPerhaps the OH, Hydrogen, and two adjacent CH-Karvins in different orientations, but if the substituents are arranged such that they provide tetrahedral geometry with all four groups distinct.\n\nAlternatively, the substituents would not all be different. For example, each carbon with OH will have adjacent carbons in the ring. But as the ring is symmetric (since cyclohexane itself isn\'t, only in certain structures), the neighbouring substituents would be the same.\n\nBut if all three substituents are in the same configuration (all 1s, 3s,5s), then the molecule may have a certain symmetry.\n\nMoreover, considering that 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane in a triol form may be a meso compound.\n\nWait, I\'m getting stuck here, but I remember that if a cyclohexane ring has three substituents at alternate positions in a plane (like 1,3,5) with the same groups and same configuration, they form a symmetrical molecule with a center of symmetry. Hence, even if each substituent is in a "stereochemistry," the overall molecule would be meso and not optically active.\n\nHence, even if the individual configuration is 1s,3s,5s (maybe all in the same chair position), the symmetry of the structure would result in internal planes of symmetry. It\'s similar to the case of 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, which is achiral.\n\nTherefore, despite each substituent potentially being on Lior\'s centers. But in reality, when comparing substituents on each of those carbons (1,3,5), if the environment is symmetric, each Chiral centers would mirror each other leading to no net optical activity. Hence, the molecule will be meso and therefore optically inactive.\n\nTherefore, the sixth component (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is not optically active.\n\nMoving to the seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Now, this is a ketone: butan-1-one is (CH3)2COH. Wait, no. Butan-1-one would be:\n\nButan-1-one: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH3. Because the ketone can\'t be on the first carbon in butan-1-one, wait, actually butan-1-one would have the ketone on Carb.position 1? There is a IUPAC nuance here.\n\nWait, butan-1-one is impossible, because the carbonyl group in a ketone must be between two carbon groups. Hence, butanone can be 2-keto: (CH3)2CO.\n\nGiven confusion here, perhaps the correct nomenclature for butan-1-one. Alternatively, since ketanes technically require (xn) Report " formato a 0es that\'s possible. But I think perhaps the correct name is butan-2-one (methylacetone). However, the given compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Assemble it.\n\nButan-1-one requires carbonyl at C1. This is typically unfeasible, but perhaps if there\'s a cyclopentyl group substituting, perhaps.\n\nButan-1-one: O=C-O... No. Wait, butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at position 1, which would result in a structure: CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. However, normally, such a compound is impossible because it\'s a ketone requiring two carbons. But perhaps with substitution? 1-cyclopentyl substitution would have a cyclopentane group attached to Carbon 1, hence making it a ketone?\n\nSo check structure: butan-1-one. Structure apart from substituents would be CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But this would be actually pentan-2-one, so perhaps forbidden.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a typo and it should be butan-2-one. But considering the given name: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nSo the numbering starts with the ketone on Carbon 1, so the formula is:\n\nO=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH3.\n\nBut wait, numbering from the ketone. So, Carbon 1 is the carbonyl, which is connected to Carbon 2 (cyclopentyl group?), Carbon 3 would be connected to a CH(CH3), and Carbon 4 to CH3.\n\nBut realistically, butan-1-one doesn\'t exist, but if announced as a group, the carbonyl group may not be on the first carbon unless removed. Hence, possible term? Could it be that this is a typo: butan-1-one might be a cyclo substitution (might be allowed as a special case).\n\nBut assuming that the name is correct, looking for stereocenters.\n\nIn this compound: ketone groups have carbonyl at Carbon 1. Let\'s see.\n\nThe molecule is structured as O=C-(group)-CH(CH3)-CH3. The group attached to Carbon 1 is cyclopentyl. So, attached to the carbonyl carbon (which can\'t be a stereocenter since it\'s double-bonded to O: actually, have only three substituents (cyclopentyl, CH(CH3), and CH3), but part of the double bond.\n\nThus, no chiral centers there. The only other carbon possibly is the Carbon 3 with methyl group. But that carbon is structure: CH(CH3), with substituents:\n\n- Carbonyl direction (but attached through Carbon 2)\n- CH3\n- Two other substituents.\n\nBut no, it\'s at Carbon 3:\n\nIf the chain starts from the ketone (Carbon 1), Carbon 2 is adjacent: that would be the Carbon attached to both the carbonyl and the cyclopentyl group. Carbon 2 is: C(CO)–C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH3.\n\nBut wait, in ketones, the carbonyl is R-C(=O)-R. Hence, if it\'s butan-1-one, then the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH3? That is, the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl.\n\nThen the carbonyl carbon is at position 1, and the rest of the chain is attached as follows:\n\nButan-1-one: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH3.\n\nApplying this structure, the compounds as a ketone would have no chiral centers because the carbonyl carbon is bonded to three groups: cyclopentyl, carbonyl, and maybe a chain. But in such structure, only:\n\n- R-Cyclopentyl\n\n- O\n\n- CH(CH3)-CH3.\n\nBut carbonyl carbons cannot be chiral (double bond to O), bonding with partial double bonds. So the question goes to other carbons.\n\nThe only possible chiral center is on the carbon bearing the CH(CH3). Let\'s check Carbon 2 (the one after carbonyl).\n\nCarbonylethyl: can Carbon 2 be? If the chain is:\n\nCarbon 1: CO- | attached to cyclopentyl\nCarbon 2: connected to CO: maybe the chain is CO-C(C5H9)-... ?\n\nWaitet confusion here. Let\'s look at the entire structure:\n\n1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: So butan-1-one is: CH3CH2CH2-CO-R? Not sure. Let me just draw it.\n\nIn butan-1-one, the ketone is on Carbon 1, but if butane has four carbons, the ketone would need to be in the middle. So, actually, butan-2-one would be more appropriate (where ketone is on C2). So perhaps the numbering occurs differently here.\n\nPerhaps in this case, butan-1-one is possible is if the cyclopentyl is at position 1. So structure is CO-C(<｜place▁holder▁no▁222｜>) as Carbon 1.\n\nWait, okay, alternativ zeros:\n\nPossible structure:\n\nCarbonyl group (O=C-) attached to Carbon 1. To the right: CarbonCyclopentyl. However, impossible as all valences are filled. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:\n\nO=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-C5H9 (but number of carbons and substituents could miscount.\n\nHowever, this is confusing. To proceed abstractly: regardless of structure, whether any chiral centers exist? Looking at suffix "one", which is ketone. The ketone carbonyl doesn\'t contribute to chirality. The only possible source is if the carbon bearing the methyl group (CH(CH3)) is a stereocenter.\n\nSo if in the structure, butan-1-one as O=C-...(But I\'m stuck again.) Alternate approach: sum up.\n\nIf we can\'t find any stereogenic centers in the molecule, then it has no optical activity.\n\nIn cis or trans positions, from the ketone?\n\nLooking into functional groups adjacent to possible stereogenic centers.\n\nBut another consideration: the ketone adjacent to a cyclopentyl group and a CH(CH3) would or wouldn’t have a chiral center.\n\nAlternatively, the possible chiral center would be at the carbon connected to the ketone, but if that carbon is the cyclopentyl group and a ch3-ch2-term?\n\nAlternatively, even if methlgroup is present, the carbon needs four different substituents.\n\nAlternatively, if the structure is:\n\nCyclopentyl group attached to the ketone\'s carbon, which is itself linked to a CH(CH3) and another carbon. However, ketone carbonyl is double bonded, so no possibility here.\n\nPossible erroneous analysis:\n\nSuppose the structure is O=C-C (CH(CH3)CH2-cyclopentyl).\n\nBut need to have butan-1-one:\n\nO\n|\nC=O - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2-cyclopentyl ?\n\nThat would be four carbons with the ketone at position 1. However, total carbons in the chain would be from the ketone: CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-C5H9. Wait, then it\'s more thah butan-... So perhaps it\'s intended to be CO-C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-2.\n\nBut in any case, the critical factor is whether any possible carbon in this molecule has four different groups attached.\n\nPossible candidate: the carbon attached to the cyclopentyl, ketone, and others. Is there a carbon with four different substituents? Let\'s imagine:\n\nAssuming that the structure is:\n\nOC-C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3))-CH2-CH3.\n\nBut wait, if the carbonyl is at position 1, then the arrangement would be: O=C-C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)). Maybe not. This remains unclear. However, if the molecule has a carbon attached to the cyclopentyl group, the ketone oxygen, a methyl group, and another CH3 or CH2 group, that would be four different groups. Without such a setup, there\'s no chirality.\n\nAlternatively, given the name- in case I\'m missing something.\n\nAlternatively, in the structure of 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, it\'s cyclopentyl group on carbon 1 (which is the same as the ketone position), then butanonecarbonyl at position 1 would have adjacent structure.\n\nBut ketone carbonyl is at position 1, then chain is from that carbon as:\n\nRadical group: (but:\n\nbutan-1-one: structure could be (O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3), but as per actual IUPAC naming, impossible. So this immediate confusion suggests the name may be a typo. However, assuming the name is correctl.\n\nRegardless, perhaps the key here is that there is no chiral center. Because the only possible candidate (assuming a carbon with four different groups) is either:\n\n- The carbon attached to the cyclopentyl group, but if finds it’s attached to Cyclopentyl, O=C, and then another group like CH2… is substituted.\n\nBut carbonyl carbons have double bonds and can\'t be centers. Any branching in the chain:\n\nlook for a carbon that\'s connected to four different substituents. Stuck again, ultimately, if there\'s no stereogenic center specified and it\'s not mentioned as a cyclic stereocenter or something else, perhaps this compound lacks a chiral center and isn\'t optically active.\n\nGiven that in the seventh compound no chiral centers can be cons arected, so it\'s inactive.\n\nSumming up all:\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene — No. stereocenter? Doesn\'t think so. No optical activity.\n\n2. (complex stereodescriptor)— Chiral centers: 3aR,7aS and E, but importantly, specified configuration implies optical Active.\n\n3. (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid — meso compound, not active.\n\n4. (2R,3R) — no plane of symmetry, active based on opposing configurations.\n\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol — assumes chiral center, active.\n\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane- that\'s meso, fsymmetrical so inactive.\n\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one — no chiral center, inactive.\n\nTotal active: 2,4,5: three compounds.\n\nWait:\n\nCompounds 2,4,5.\n\nBut steps：\n\n1. inactive  \n\n2. active (yes)  \n\n3. inactive  \n\n4. active (yes)  \n\n5. active (yes)   \n\n6. inactive  \n\n7. inactive.\n\nTotal of 3 optically active compounds.\n\nBut wait initial assessment of compound 5: would cyclohexen-3-ene-1-ol (R) configuration have a chiral center.\n\nBut what if the double bond causes asymmetric environments, preventing an internal plane of symmetry. For example, cyclohex????kashii. If substituents on C1 are different (like for the OH say, c) ed, then yes,it\'s a chiral center. When you down in to it, if C1 has four distinct groups: OH, H, and two adjacent ring carbons that are made different by the presence of the double bond (making their substituents different), Hence yes.\n\nTherefore, the fifth compound is active.\n\nThus, the total active compounds: 2,4,5, which gives us 3 compounds. But I need to verify the actual answer.\n\nBut to avoidtaken time, let\'s count again.\n\n1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene — Result: Inactive ?\n\nYes. Z config doesn\'t imply chirality. But since doubles only affect geometric isomerism, unless some substituents create a chiral center. Check if the central double bond carbons carry four different groups.\n\nThe structure is Cl-C(Cl,même)=CH(CH3)Wait, the structure here they are double-bonded carbons:\n\nIf the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, but maybe not. Wait: but-1-ene is position 1 and 2, right?\n\nWait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. In the given compound, it\'s 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.\n\nStructure: Cl substituent on carbon 1 (but-1-ene has the double bond starting between C1 and C2).\n\nThus:\n\nCarbon 1: Cl.\nCarbon 2: CH(CH3)\nDouble bond between C1 and C2.\n\nThus structure: Cl-C= C (CH3)CH2CH3.\n\nBut wait, 1-chloro is on C1 (C1=Cl-C=...).\n\nBut the carbons in the double bond are C1 and C2.\n\nSo substitute positions:\n\nC1: Cl attached, double bond to C2.\n\nC2: attached to C1 (double bond), methyl (CH3), and ethylene and CH2CH3.\n\nBut the actual consideration. Each double bond carbon has three groups attached (due to double bond: two bonds to each other). So around each of C1 and C2:\n\nAt C1: aCl, then the double bond to C2, and two CH? Wait, for sp² hybridization. There is one Cl, one double to C2, and two other groups?\n\nNo,a carbon in a double bond has three substituents. For but-1-ene with Cl on C1 and methyl on C2, the actual structure for (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is C1:Cl-C=C(CH3)-CH2CH3.\n\nSo C1 is Cl-C…, which is part of the double bond. The groups around C1 are:\n\nCl, double bond to C2, and CH2CH3 group. Hence only three substituents.\n\nSimilarly, C2 is: double bond to C1, methyl (CH3), and CH2CH3.\n\nWait, line formula:\n\nCl\n            \n            C=C\n\n(CH3)   CH2CH3\n\nSo in that case, the chemicals around C1 are Cl, CH2CH3, and the double bond (counted as two substituents?), but realistically, only three groups for each. Thus, neither of the carbons in the double bond has four substituents, so no chiral center.\n\nSupporting that first compound is not optically active.\n\nTherefore, total active should be compounds 2,4,5 = 3 compounds.\n\nI\'ll add that tally.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 3 compounds.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744976180, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=10908, prompt_tokens=543, total_tokens=11451, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the number of optically active compounds, we analyze each for the presence of chirality (stereocenters) and whether internal symmetry (meso compounds) negates activity:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   The double bond carbons are not stereocenters (only three substituents each). No other stereocenters exist.  
   **Not optically active.**

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   Specified stereochemistry (3aR, 7aS) indicates chiral centers. Complex structure lacks internal symmetry.  
   **Optically active.**

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Opposing configurations at C2 and C3 create a plane of symmetry (meso compound).  
   **Not optically active.**

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Identical configurations at C2 and C3 preclude symmetry, maintaining chirality.  
   **Optically active.**

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   C1 is a stereocenter (OH, H, and two non-equivalent ring carbons due to double bond).  
   **Optically active.**

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   Symmetrical 1,3,5 substitution creates an internal plane of symmetry (meso compound).  
   **Not optically active.**

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   No chiral centers (carbonyl carbon is not a stereocenter, other carbons lack four distinct groups).  
   **Not optically active.**

**Total optically active compounds: 3 (compounds 2, 4, 5).**

\boxed{3}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The molecule has multiple rings and stereocenters listed. The fact that it has specified stereochemistry (3aR,7aS,E) already implies the presence of chirality. The (E) configuration refers to the chloromethylene group. Even with the complex structure, as long as there are chiral centers (like 3aR and 7aS), and no internal planes of symmetry, this compound should be optically active. So this one probably is active.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOCCH2CH2COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethyl, substituents on carbons 2 and 3. So HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH. The configuration is 2R and 3S. Considering these stereocenters: each of carbons 2 and 3 has COOH, CH3, CH2, and another CH as substituents. Wait, maybe?

Wait, the structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH?

But wait, the parent chain would be four carbons for succinic acid (HOOCCH2CH2COOH). If it's 2,3-dimethyl, then carbons 2 and 3 each have methyl groups. The actual structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Then each of the central carbons (2 and 3) should have substituents: two COOH groups on each? Wait, the two COOH would be at the ends (carbons 1 and 4). Let me clarify.

Succinic acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H. So numbering from the left: carbon 1 (COOH), carbon 2 (CH2), carbon 3 (CH2), carbon 4 (COOH). Then 2,3-dimethyl would add a methyl to carbons 2 and 3. So carbon 2 becomes CH(CH3), carbon 3 becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Carbon 2 has substituents: COOH (from C1), CH3, CH(CH3) (to C3), and a hydrogen. Wait, carbon 2 is attached to:

Previous carbon (C1: COOH), then three bonds: CH(CH3), then next carbon (C3: CH(CH3)), and a hydrogen. Wait, actually, carbons 2 and 3 are each CH(CH3). Let's consider the structure again.

Each of carbons 2 and 3 would be attached to:

For carbon 2: groups are:

- COOH (from C1?)

No, wait, carbon 1 is COOH, connected via a CH- group. Carbon 1 would be COOH-CH2-CH2-COOH. If this becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then carbon 2 is CH(CH3), attached to COOH (C1), the methyl group, the adjacent C3 (which is also CH(CH3)), and a hydrogen? Similarly for carbon 3.

Wait, carbons 2 and 3 each have a CH(CH3), right? Therefore, for each of these carbons, substituents would be:

- Adjacent carbon (either C1 or C4)

Wait, maybe the substituents would be for Carbon 2:

Left group: COOH (from C1), right group: C3 (CH(CH3)), methyl group, and a hydrogen?

Wait, yes. So if Carbon 2 has a COOH group (from the chain), a CH3 group, a CH(CH3) from Carbon 3, and a hydrogen, then substituents are COOH, CH3, CH(CH3), and H. No, actually, when you're looking at substituents on the stereocenter, it's the four groups directly attached.

Carbon 2: connected to:

- C1: this is a CH2 group with a COOH at the end. But in this case, perhaps it's actually carbon 2 as CH(CH3) connected to COO- ?

Alternatively, perhaps I should draw the actual structure.

Original succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. 2,3-dimethyl would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of Carbons 2 and 3 is CH(CH3).

Therefore, substituents on Carbon 2: the carboxylic acid (from C1), a methyl group, the adjacent CH(CH3) (Carbon 3 with its substituents), and the other substituent is... wait, Carbon 2 is a central carbon that is CH(CH3), but actually, because it's a chain of four carbons, the substituents would be:

Wait, carbon 2 is the second carbon. If the structure is:

1: COOH (on C1)

2: CH(CH3) connected to C1 and C3

3: CH(CH3) connected to C2 and C4

4: COOH (on C4)

Therefore, Carbon 2's substituents are:

- A single bond to C1 (which is carbon 1, which has COOH)... but when considering substituents on carbon 2, he's directly connected to three groups: one is the methyl group (CH3), another is the group towards C1 (which is a CH2 group leading to the COOH?), wait, maybe not. Maybe the actual substituents are:

If Carbon 2 is CH(CH3), its substituents would be:

1. The group from C1, which is a CH2 group (since Carbon 1 is COO-C. Wait, let me model this more accurately.

Wait, the original compound is 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, so:

Succinic acid is: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH

After adding methyl groups on carbons 2 and 3:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH

So each CH2 becomes a CH(CH3). Now, look at each of these carbons (carbons 2 and 3). For each one, the substituents would be attached as:

On Carbon 2: connected groups are:

- The COOH at the end (two carbons away), but the immediate substituents are: the adjacent Carbon 1 is connected via a single bond. But no, in between C1 and C2 is a single bond, but C1 is actually COOHCH2.

Wait, confusion arises. Let me reconsider:

Carbon 1 is the first carbonyl carbon (COOH), so the structure would be:

COOH (C1) - CH(CH3) (C2) - CH(CH3) (C3) - COOH (C4)

Wait, no: COOH is attached to carbon 1 and carbon 4. Each carbon 2 and 3 has CH(CH3). So C1 is COOH, then CH(CH3)-CH(CH3), then COOH.

Therefore, Carbon 2: adjacent groups are: C1 (which is a COO- group attached via a CH, but wait. Let me represent it step by step.

The structure is HOOC - CH(CH3) - CH(CH3) - COOH. So the chain is four carbons: 1 (COOH), 2 (CH(CH3)), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (COOH).

Thus, Carbon 2 is CH(CH3). The substituents on Carbon 2 are:

- Two CH groups (since between the COOH and Carbon 2 is a single bond, hence substituents):

Wait, Carbon 2 substituents would actually be:

1. The left group is a -COOH attached to C1, but Carbon 2 itself is a central carbon. No, wait structurally, Carbon 2 is connected directly to three groups: COO group is attached to C1, but the actual bonds on Carbon 2 are:

Wait, sorr for confusion. Maybe a better approach: each Carbon 2 in this chain has four substituents:

For Carbon 2: substituents are:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- A hydrogen (even if not shown)
- The chaining carbon C1, which is connected to the COOH. So the group from C1 is a -CH(COOH) structure. Wait, perhaps that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps here's the bonding:

Each of the middle carbons (2 and 3) are connected to:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- Two other adjacent carbons (C1 and C3 for Carbon 2; C2 and C4 for Carbon 3)
- And a hydrogen atom.

Therefore, each may have the substituents:

Carbon 2: -CH(CH3)-

Connected to:

- To one side: a COOH group (through Carbon 1)

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Another angle: substituent groups. For each stereogenic center (chiral center), the four substituents must be different.

Photosuccinic acid is 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid, but here we have 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, which is 2,3-dimethylbutanedioic acid.

Carbon 2 and 3 each have a methyl group and three other groups. So apart from the methyl group at carbons 2 and 3, each must be connected to:

- Carboxylic acid groups?

Actually, Carbon 2 is in the middle: connected to Carbon 1 (which has a COOH group) and Carbon 3 (which has the other CH(CH3)), and Carbon 4 (COOH). Wait, perhaps not. Carbon 2 is connected thus: HOOC-CH(CH3)-. So each of the central carbons (2 and 3) is a CH(CH3), which themselves link the two COOH groups.

So for Carbon 2 (in 2R,3S), substituents would be:

1. The COOH group on the left (from Carbon 1)
2. The methyl group
3. The adjacent CH(CH3) at Carbon 3
4. A hydrogen atom?

Wait, perhaps the substituents for Carbon 2 are:

- -COOH (from C1)
- -CH(CH3) (its own methyl)
- -CH(CH3) (from C3)
- ???

Wait, Carbon 2 can only have substituents directly attached to it. Thus, substituents would be:

- One CH3 (methyl group)
- Two CH groups (next to each other: C1 and C3)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps the groups are as follows:

Carbon 1: COOH–CH(CH3) where the CH(CH3) is Carbon 2. Then Carbon 2 is attached to:

- COOH (as part of Carbon 1)
- CH(CH3) (as the central Carbon attached to Carbon 3)
- A methyl group (-CH3)
- And a hydrogen (H)

Wait, that gives four substituents: a COOH-connected chain (maybe a -CH2 for C1 but this is confusing). Alternatively, Carbon 2 is a CH group with substituents:

Wait, if Carbon 2 has groups:

1. The two parts of the chain: toward C1 (which is –COOH–CH2–) is becoming –COOH–CH(CH3)– but the actual bonds are:

The structure probably is HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH.

Thus, each carbon 2 and 3 are each –CH(CH3)-, and the HOOC and COOH are on the ends. Now, in such a structure, each –CH(CH3) is connected to two CH groups (since adjacent to carbons with only two carbons each?), or ?

Alternatively, let's orient Carbon 2 and Carbon 3 each as such:

Carbon 2: adjacent to COOH on one side and Carbon 3 on the other. Each has a methyl group and whether the four substituents are different.

For Carbon 2: the four substituents would be:

1. The chain towards COOH (so a -CH2- group leading to COOH? Wait. Wait, the actual structure is:

C1: COOH

C2: CH(CH3)

C3: CH(CH3)

C4: COOH

But the chain is between C1 and C2 is a single bond. So for Carbon 2, substituents are:

- COO- (from C1)
- methyl group (-CH3)
- -CH(CH3)- (C3)
- Hydrogen

Wait, no: Each Carbon 2 is connected directly to:

- C1 (which is COOH attached to a CH2? No, probably not. Wait, actually, the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So Carbon 2 is actually the first CH(CH3) connected to the COOH at the left. Carbon 2's substituents would be:

- The COOH group (from the left), which is adjacent via the C1 carbon (which is a carboxylic acid group, so maybe for Carbon 2: the substituent is a -COOH-CH2-group? Wait, maybe again, visualize bonding.

Alternatively, perhaps this molecule has two stereocenters: Carbon 2 and Carbon 3. If that's the case, then both having methyl groups and four substituents. But in order to have four different groups, they must each be attached to four distinct groups.

Assuming the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then each of Carbon 2 and Carbon 3 would have:

Substituents:

1. COOH (at one end or through a chain)
2. COOH at the other end or through a chain
3. Methyl group
4. Hydrogen

But perhaps in actuality, Carbon 2's substituents are:

- The left COOH (actually via a CH chain? Maybe Carbon 1, but Carbon 1 is part of the COOH group attached to C2). Wait, here's a more precise structure: HOOC–CH(CH3)–CH(CH3)–COOH, so each CH(CH3) is connected to the adjacent carbons:

So the actual substituents on Carbon 2 are:

- COO- group (OOCR, from the left),
- A methyl group (CH3),
- A CH group (from Carbon 3 with its substituents), and
- A hydrogen.

Similarly for Carbon 3.

But this would mean that each has four different substituents. Wait, but are these groups distinct?

If both carbons (2 and 3) are CH(CH3), then for Carbon 2, substituents are:

- Left group: COOH connected via a single bond (that’s the OOCR group)
- Right group: CH(CH3) (the next carbon)
- Methyl group (CH3)
- A hydrogen (H)

But are the left and right groups different?

Carbon 2 is linked to Carbon 1 (via a single bond: CH(CH3)-COOH) and Carbon 3 (via a single bond to another CH(CH3)). So substituent groups on Carbon 2:

Groups on C2 would be:

- COOH, (but attached through a single bond to Carbon 1: so the actual substituents in that direction are a -OOC–CH2 group? Not exactly.

Perhaps considering the substituents as:

- Two single bonds to carbons (C1 and C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. If C1 and C3 have different substituents, then substituents on C2 would be different.

Wait, no, if Carbon 1 is COOH-CH(CH3)-, then Carbon 1 is part of the COOH group. But how is Carbon 2 connected? Wait, Carbon 1 in succinic acid is a carbon adjacent to COOH.

Maybe I need to find the actual IUPAC structure. For succinic acid (butanedioic acid), the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, the name "2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid" implies the two methyl groups are on the second and third carbons of the succinic acid chain. Hence, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

In that case, the two central carbons (2 and 3) are each bonded to:

- Two carboxylic acid groups (through the chain, not directly)
- Two methyl groups
Wait, no. Each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) now have methyl groups and other substituents.

On each of these carbons, the substituents are as follows:

For C2:

- Methyl group (CH3)
- Adjacent to carbon 1: which is linked to COOH (so, the substituent group here is a -CH2–COOH if there's no substitution, but since it's substituted, becomes -CH(CH3)). Wait, perhaps I need to break it down:

In the original chain (unsubstituted): Carbon 1 is COOH, Carbon 2 is CH2, Carbon 3 is CH2, Carbon 4 is COOH.

With substitution at C2 and C3 as methyl groups: Carbon 2 becomes CH(CH3), Carbon 3 becomes CH(CH3).

So the central chain is HOOC–C(CH3)–C(CH3)–COOH. The substituents on C2, for example, would be: one methyl (CH3), the adjacent C(CH3) (Carbon 3), the COOH group (via Carbon 1?), and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, but when you actually look at the substituents attached directly to C2, they would be:

Four substituents:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- A single bond to Carbon 1 (which is part of the COOH group)
- A single bond to Carbon 3 (which is also a CH(CH3))
- A hydrogen atom

But wait, perhaps Carbon 2's substituents are:

- CH3 (methyl)
- Two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3)
- Hydrogen

So only three bonds. Wait, but each carbon in the chain has four bonds. Carbon 2 would be connected to:

- Carbon 1 (COOH group via CH)
- Carbon 3 (CH(CH3))
- A methyl group (CH3)
- A hydrogen (H)

Therefore, substituents on C2 are:

-CH2(COOH) group (via carbon 1?), wait, not exactly. Wait, Carbon 1 is COOH, so Carbon 1 is spelled out as COOH-C... but in this case, Carbon 1 (HOOC-CH... ) So the actual substituent is a -CH2- group attached to COOH?

I think I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps the conclusion is that the carbons connected to two methyl groups and other groups would have four different substituents. Specifically, since each of carbons 2 and 3 has two methyl groups and different substituents, but in reality, if the two substituents next to methyl are mirror images, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, let's consider meso compounds. Dimethylsuccinic acid might be similar to tartaric acid. If both stereocenters are R and S, that could lead to a meso compound, which is not optically active.

In the given compound (2R,3S), would that make it meso? Let's see.

Tartaric acid has 2,3-dihydroxy with (R,R) and (S,S) being enantiomers and (R,S) being meso.

Similarly, if we have 2R,3S-dimethylsuccinic acid. If carbons 2 and 3 are each a stereocenter with opposite configurations, then there would be an internal plane of symmetry. Hence, the compound would be meso and thus not optically active.

Wait, let's proceed step by step.

If the configuration of carbons in 2 and 3 is opposite (R and S), then looking at whether a plane of symmetry exists. Whether mirroring across the center would produce the same molecule. For succinic acid derivatives with substituents in 2 and 3-positions in opposing configurations, check meso forms.

For instance, the molecule HOOC-CR(CH3)-CS(CH3)-COOH... if there's an internal plane of symmetry between the two stereocenters then it's meso and hence achiral. For example, in tartaric acid, the (2R,3S) would be a meso compound. Similarly here, (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, if such a plane exists, is meso and not chiral. Hence, non-optically active.

But the question is about (2R,3S) versus (2R,3R). So for the third compound: (2R,3S). If it's meso, then no optical activity. The fourth compound is (2R,3R), which would have same configuration on both centers, meaning no plane of symmetry – hence, it's chiral and optically active.

So third compound: (2R,3S) = meso, not active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R) = active.

Shoot, the third and fourth compounds are thus differing: the third would be meso, so not active; the fourth would not be meso (both R), making it active.

Then moving on, fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

Checking if the cyclohexene ring with alcohol group at 1 and double bond at 3 has a chiral center. Since it's specified as R configuration, that carbon (1) must have four different groups. Let's model this structure.

Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4 (since numbering starts from the alcohol group which is at position 1. So with OH on C1, double bond between C3 and C4. The chiral center would be C1. Let's see what substituents C1 has.

- The cyclohexene ring is fused: considering C1, connected to two adjacent ring Carbons (C2 and C6), an OH group, and a hydrogen.

But wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1 would be:

- C2 (ring)
- C6 (ring)
- OH
- And the bridgehead structure (a bridge if any). Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. For cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the alcohol is on C1, and double bond between C3-C4.

But in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So for C1: substituents would be connected to C2 and C6, the OH group, and the ring junction. However, in a chair-like conformation or something else, unless there is a bridge, it's a regular cyclohexene ring.

But for C1 to be a chiral center, the four substituents attached to it must be different. The substituents would be:

- OH
- C2 (which is part of the ring)
- C6 (which is part of the ring)
- And the ring atom?

Wait, no. Structure: the ring is cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with a double bond. The hydroxyl is on C1. So the four substituents on C1 are:

- Adjacent Carbons (C2 and C6)
- OH group
- A hydrogen (H)

But, wait, in such a ring, the C1 would be connected to three ring carbons (two neighbors and one other)? No, each carbon in the cyclohexene ring is only connected to two neighboring carbons and two substituents, right? Wait, standard cyclohexene structure: each carbon has two substituents (maybe hydrogen or other groups).

Wait, the alcohol in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would be on C1. So C1 is analogous to a chair position. If the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, the chair conformation is less critical here. The question is whether C1 has four different substituents.

To have a chiral center, C1 should have four different groups: OH, H, and two different ring substituents. But in a cyclohexene ring, would C1 have substituents symmetrically?

Wait, for example, if cyclohexene is in a chair, then C1, when it has an OH group, would have substituents: OH, H, and two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), right? But the ring is connected such that C2 and C6 may have similar environments, making them equivalent.

If the ring has a double bond from C3-C4, then that could create some asymmetry. However, depending on the positioning of substituents.

But if the ring is unsymmetrical due to the double bond, the groups attached to C1 could differ. For instance, C2 would be adjacent to the double bond. Depending on the confirmation, whether the substituents around C1 create four distinct groups.

But let's think in terms of substituents on the ring:

Cekurueer. C1 has:

- OH

- H

- Two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). Now, these two will be in different positions due to the double bond.

Carbon 3 and 4 have a double bond, so C3 is connected to C2 and C4 (double bond), and C4 is connected to C3 (double), C5. Carbon 5 is connected to C4 and C6. C6 is connected to C5 and C1.

If we consider that the double bond creates an unsymmetrical structure, then C2 and C6 might not be equivalent. Let's picture this:

But the key is whether the two ring carbon substituents on C1 are equivalent or not. If the ring is asymmetric due to the double bond, C1's connections to C2 and C6 might lead to different substituents.

Alternatively, since the double bond creates a different environment for C2 and C6. For instance, C2 is adjacent to C3 (part of the double bond), while C6 is adjacent to C5 and C1. But even so, the substituents to criteria for a chiral center would be the groups attached to C1.

Wait, in the chair form, maybe, but cyclohexene typically isn't a flat ring, so the substituents (OH, C2, C6, and H) might all be different. Thus, if C1 has those four distinct groups, then the (R)-configuration would make it chiral and hence optically active.

However, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Let's imagine. If the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, then looking at the substituents on C1:

C1: OH group, H, and two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6). Now, how do the positions of the double bond affect the substituents on C1?

If the double bond is between C3-C4, then C2 is connected to C3 (which is part of the double bond). The other features of the ring (like substituents) might make the surrounding groups on C1 different.

Alternatively, it's possible that the ring's geometry inherently makes C2 and C6 nonequivalent, leading to a chiral center at C1.

Since the problem specifies the configuration as (R), they must consider C1 to be a chiral center; thereby, the compound is optically active. So the fifth compound is active.

The sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

Triol with all three hydroxyl groups in same positions but same substituents. Looking for symmetry here. Cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at 1,3,5-positions in s-configuration.

Wait, when substituents on cyclohexane are at 1,3,5 positions all axial or equatorial. But if all are s-configuration, that would typically be all axial or all with a certain configuration. But cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with three hydroxyl groups arranged symmetrically. Since 1,3,5 are opposites of each other, the arrangement would form a symmetric structure (like 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, which is a symmetric compound, hence meso, achiral).

If substitutions on 1,3,5 cyclohexane (which are mirror positions) if in the same configuration, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Hence, even with stereocenters, the overall molecule could be achiral.

Example: 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, if three methyl groups are all in axial positions, there would be planes of symmetry making the entire structure achiral, hence no optical activity. Similarly, for a triol in the same positions, if all substituents are in the same configuration (all R or all S), but due to the symmetry, they might cancel out any chirality.

But in terms of each substituent, each Carbon (1,3,5) has an OH group and other substituents. To analyze chirality:

If each of these positions (1,3,5) on the cyclohexane ring are stereocenters, whether each has four different substituents.

However, cyclohexane rings are typically more conducive to this analysis. So each OH would be in an equatorial or axial position.

But for a chiral center, each substituent would need four different groups attached. In cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, each OH is at carbons 1,3,5. The rest of the substituents are hydrogen and two adjacent carbons.

But wait, each of these carbons (1,3,5) would have substituents:

- OH
- Two adjacent carbons (on the ring)
- One hydrogen (assuming that the other substituents are all Hs). However, that would make three identical (two ring carbons and perhaps a hydrogen). Alternatively, each contains an OH and three other groups (adjacent ring carbons and two hydrogens?), which wouldn't create a stereocenter.

Wait, COFUSED...

No, even sophomorically, each carbon in the cyclohexane ring is CH2, unless substituted. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol would have three -OH groups on carbons 1,3,5. So those carbons would be COH groups. The other substituents.

For example, carbon 1 would have:

- OH
- Two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6)
- One hydrogen

Similarly, if for carbons 1,3,5. Given that the molecule is cyclohexane (all single bonds), substituents on these carbons would be OH, H, and two adjacent CH2's.

Thus, each stereocenter (i.e. carbon with OH) would have four different groups: OH, H, (CH2 leading to C2 and to C6). But in a chair conformation, perhaps the substituents adjacent are different.

But each carbon with OH would have:

- Up: OH
- Down: H
- Adjacent carbons: but in cyclohexane, the adjacent carbons are connected via CH2 groups. Wait, isn't cyclohexane composed of six equivalents of CH2 groups?

Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, each carbon attached to two other carbons. So normally, each carbon has two CH2 groups.

However, if we use fixed positions for substituents, the substituent (OH) is part of the half-chair. But perhaps the problem is that if substituents are in the axial vs equatorial positions, this can create distinct groups.

But unless other substituents are on the carbons, maybe we can't create chirality.

Wait, for a cyclohexane ring with three substituents (OHs at 1,3,5). If all three are in a equatorial positions, then each carbon (1,3,5) would instead have substituents:

Perhaps the OH, Hydrogen, and two adjacent CH-Karvins in different orientations, but if the substituents are arranged such that they provide tetrahedral geometry with all four groups distinct.

Alternatively, the substituents would not all be different. For example, each carbon with OH will have adjacent carbons in the ring. But as the ring is symmetric (since cyclohexane itself isn't, only in certain structures), the neighbouring substituents would be the same.

But if all three substituents are in the same configuration (all 1s, 3s,5s), then the molecule may have a certain symmetry.

Moreover, considering that 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane in a triol form may be a meso compound.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here, but I remember that if a cyclohexane ring has three substituents at alternate positions in a plane (like 1,3,5) with the same groups and same configuration, they form a symmetrical molecule with a center of symmetry. Hence, even if each substituent is in a "stereochemistry," the overall molecule would be meso and not optically active.

Hence, even if the individual configuration is 1s,3s,5s (maybe all in the same chair position), the symmetry of the structure would result in internal planes of symmetry. It's similar to the case of 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, which is achiral.

Therefore, despite each substituent potentially being on Lior's centers. But in reality, when comparing substituents on each of those carbons (1,3,5), if the environment is symmetric, each Chiral centers would mirror each other leading to no net optical activity. Hence, the molecule will be meso and therefore optically inactive.

Therefore, the sixth component (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol is not optically active.

Moving to the seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Now, this is a ketone: butan-1-one is (CH3)2COH. Wait, no. Butan-1-one would be:

Butan-1-one: O=C-CH2-CH2-CH3. Because the ketone can't be on the first carbon in butan-1-one, wait, actually butan-1-one would have the ketone on Carb.position 1? There is a IUPAC nuance here.

Wait, butan-1-one is impossible, because the carbonyl group in a ketone must be between two carbon groups. Hence, butanone can be 2-keto: (CH3)2CO.

Given confusion here, perhaps the correct nomenclature for butan-1-one. Alternatively, since ketanes technically require (xn) Report " formato a 0es that's possible. But I think perhaps the correct name is butan-2-one (methylacetone). However, the given compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Assemble it.

Butan-1-one requires carbonyl at C1. This is typically unfeasible, but perhaps if there's a cyclopentyl group substituting, perhaps.

Butan-1-one: O=C-O... No. Wait, butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at position 1, which would result in a structure: CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. However, normally, such a compound is impossible because it's a ketone requiring two carbons. But perhaps with substitution? 1-cyclopentyl substitution would have a cyclopentane group attached to Carbon 1, hence making it a ketone?

So check structure: butan-1-one. Structure apart from substituents would be CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But this would be actually pentan-2-one, so perhaps forbidden.

Alternatively, perhaps a typo and it should be butan-2-one. But considering the given name: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

So the numbering starts with the ketone on Carbon 1, so the formula is:

O=C-C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH3.

But wait, numbering from the ketone. So, Carbon 1 is the carbonyl, which is connected to Carbon 2 (cyclopentyl group?), Carbon 3 would be connected to a CH(CH3), and Carbon 4 to CH3.

But realistically, butan-1-one doesn't exist, but if announced as a group, the carbonyl group may not be on the first carbon unless removed. Hence, possible term? Could it be that this is a typo: butan-1-one might be a cyclo substitution (might be allowed as a special case).

But assuming that the name is correct, looking for stereocenters.

In this compound: ketone groups have carbonyl at Carbon 1. Let's see.

The molecule is structured as O=C-(group)-CH(CH3)-CH3. The group attached to Carbon 1 is cyclopentyl. So, attached to the carbonyl carbon (which can't be a stereocenter since it's double-bonded to O: actually, have only three substituents (cyclopentyl, CH(CH3), and CH3), but part of the double bond.

Thus, no chiral centers there. The only other carbon possibly is the Carbon 3 with methyl group. But that carbon is structure: CH(CH3), with substituents:

- Carbonyl direction (but attached through Carbon 2)
- CH3
- Two other substituents.

But no, it's at Carbon 3:

If the chain starts from the ketone (Carbon 1), Carbon 2 is adjacent: that would be the Carbon attached to both the carbonyl and the cyclopentyl group. Carbon 2 is: C(CO)–C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH3.

But wait, in ketones, the carbonyl is R-C(=O)-R. Hence, if it's butan-1-one, then the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH3? That is, the cyclopentyl is attached to the carbonyl.

Then the carbonyl carbon is at position 1, and the rest of the chain is attached as follows:

Butan-1-one: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Applying this structure, the compounds as a ketone would have no chiral centers because the carbonyl carbon is bonded to three groups: cyclopentyl, carbonyl, and maybe a chain. But in such structure, only:

- R-Cyclopentyl

- O

- CH(CH3)-CH3.

But carbonyl carbons cannot be chiral (double bond to O), bonding with partial double bonds. So the question goes to other carbons.

The only possible chiral center is on the carbon bearing the CH(CH3). Let's check Carbon 2 (the one after carbonyl).

Carbonylethyl: can Carbon 2 be? If the chain is:

Carbon 1: CO- | attached to cyclopentyl
Carbon 2: connected to CO: maybe the chain is CO-C(C5H9)-... ?

Waitet confusion here. Let's look at the entire structure:

1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: So butan-1-one is: CH3CH2CH2-CO-R? Not sure. Let me just draw it.

In butan-1-one, the ketone is on Carbon 1, but if butane has four carbons, the ketone would need to be in the middle. So, actually, butan-2-one would be more appropriate (where ketone is on C2). So perhaps the numbering occurs differently here.

Perhaps in this case, butan-1-one is possible is if the cyclopentyl is at position 1. So structure is CO-C(<｜place▁holder▁no▁222｜>) as Carbon 1.

Wait, okay, alternativ zeros:

Possible structure:

Carbonyl group (O=C-) attached to Carbon 1. To the right: CarbonCyclopentyl. However, impossible as all valences are filled. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-C5H9 (but number of carbons and substituents could miscount.

However, this is confusing. To proceed abstractly: regardless of structure, whether any chiral centers exist? Looking at suffix "one", which is ketone. The ketone carbonyl doesn't contribute to chirality. The only possible source is if the carbon bearing the methyl group (CH(CH3)) is a stereocenter.

So if in the structure, butan-1-one as O=C-...(But I'm stuck again.) Alternate approach: sum up.

If we can't find any stereogenic centers in the molecule, then it has no optical activity.

In cis or trans positions, from the ketone?

Looking into functional groups adjacent to possible stereogenic centers.

But another consideration: the ketone adjacent to a cyclopentyl group and a CH(CH3) would or wouldn’t have a chiral center.

Alternatively, the possible chiral center would be at the carbon connected to the ketone, but if that carbon is the cyclopentyl group and a ch3-ch2-term?

Alternatively, even if methlgroup is present, the carbon needs four different substituents.

Alternatively, if the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to the ketone's carbon, which is itself linked to a CH(CH3) and another carbon. However, ketone carbonyl is double bonded, so no possibility here.

Possible erroneous analysis:

Suppose the structure is O=C-C (CH(CH3)CH2-cyclopentyl).

But need to have butan-1-one:

O

C=O - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2-cyclopentyl ?

That would be four carbons with the ketone at position 1. However, total carbons in the chain would be from the ketone: CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-C5H9. Wait, then it's more thah butan-... So perhaps it's intended to be CO-C(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-2.

But in any case, the critical factor is whether any possible carbon in this molecule has four different groups attached.

Possible candidate: the carbon attached to the cyclopentyl, ketone, and others. Is there a carbon with four different substituents? Let's imagine:

Assuming that the structure is:

OC-C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3))-CH2-CH3.

But wait, if the carbonyl is at position 1, then the arrangement would be: O=C-C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)). Maybe not. This remains unclear. However, if the molecule has a carbon attached to the cyclopentyl group, the ketone oxygen, a methyl group, and another CH3 or CH2 group, that would be four different groups. Without such a setup, there's no chirality.

Alternatively, given the name- in case I'm missing something.

Alternatively, in the structure of 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, it's cyclopentyl group on carbon 1 (which is the same as the ketone position), then butanonecarbonyl at position 1 would have adjacent structure.

But ketone carbonyl is at position 1, then chain is from that carbon as:

Radical group: (but:

butan-1-one: structure could be (O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3), but as per actual IUPAC naming, impossible. So this immediate confusion suggests the name may be a typo. However, assuming the name is correctl.

Regardless, perhaps the key here is that there is no chiral center. Because the only possible candidate (assuming a carbon with four different groups) is either:

- The carbon attached to the cyclopentyl group, but if finds it’s attached to Cyclopentyl, O=C, and then another group like CH2… is substituted.

But carbonyl carbons have double bonds and can't be centers. Any branching in the chain:

look for a carbon that's connected to four different substituents. Stuck again, ultimately, if there's no stereogenic center specified and it's not mentioned as a cyclic stereocenter or something else, perhaps this compound lacks a chiral center and isn't optically active.

Given that in the seventh compound no chiral centers can be cons arected, so it's inactive.

Summing up all:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene — No. stereocenter? Doesn't think so. No optical activity.

2. (complex stereodescriptor)— Chiral centers: 3aR,7aS and E, but importantly, specified configuration implies optical Active.

3. (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid — meso compound, not active.

4. (2R,3R) — no plane of symmetry, active based on opposing configurations.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol — assumes chiral center, active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane- that's meso, fsymmetrical so inactive.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one — no chiral center, inactive.

Total active: 2,4,5: three compounds.

Wait:

Compounds 2,4,5.

But steps：

1. inactive  

2. active (yes)  

3. inactive  

4. active (yes)  

5. active (yes)   

6. inactive  

7. inactive.

Total of 3 optically active compounds.

But wait initial assessment of compound 5: would cyclohexen-3-ene-1-ol (R) configuration have a chiral center.

But what if the double bond causes asymmetric environments, preventing an internal plane of symmetry. For example, cyclohex????kashii. If substituents on C1 are different (like for the OH say, c) ed, then yes,it's a chiral center. When you down in to it, if C1 has four distinct groups: OH, H, and two adjacent ring carbons that are made different by the presence of the double bond (making their substituents different), Hence yes.

Therefore, the fifth compound is active.

Thus, the total active compounds: 2,4,5, which gives us 3 compounds. But I need to verify the actual answer.

But to avoidtaken time, let's count again.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene — Result: Inactive ?

Yes. Z config doesn't imply chirality. But since doubles only affect geometric isomerism, unless some substituents create a chiral center. Check if the central double bond carbons carry four different groups.

The structure is Cl-C(Cl,même)=CH(CH3)Wait, the structure here they are double-bonded carbons:

If the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, but maybe not. Wait: but-1-ene is position 1 and 2, right?

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. In the given compound, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

Structure: Cl substituent on carbon 1 (but-1-ene has the double bond starting between C1 and C2).

Thus:

Carbon 1: Cl.
Carbon 2: CH(CH3)
Double bond between C1 and C2.

Thus structure: Cl-C= C (CH3)CH2CH3.

But wait, 1-chloro is on C1 (C1=Cl-C=...).

But the carbons in the double bond are C1 and C2.

So substitute positions:

C1: Cl attached, double bond to C2.

C2: attached to C1 (double bond), methyl (CH3), and ethylene and CH2CH3.

But the actual consideration. Each double bond carbon has three groups attached (due to double bond: two bonds to each other). So around each of C1 and C2:

At C1: aCl, then the double bond to C2, and two CH? Wait, for sp² hybridization. There is one Cl, one double to C2, and two other groups?

No,a carbon in a double bond has three substituents. For but-1-ene with Cl on C1 and methyl on C2, the actual structure for (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is C1:Cl-C=C(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So C1 is Cl-C…, which is part of the double bond. The groups around C1 are:

Cl, double bond to C2, and CH2CH3 group. Hence only three substituents.

Similarly, C2 is: double bond to C1, methyl (CH3), and CH2CH3.

Wait, line formula:

Cl
            
            C=C

(CH3)   CH2CH3

So in that case, the chemicals around C1 are Cl, CH2CH3, and the double bond (counted as two substituents?), but realistically, only three groups for each. Thus, neither of the carbons in the double bond has four substituents, so no chiral center.

Supporting that first compound is not optically active.

Therefore, total active should be compounds 2,4,5 = 3 compounds.

I'll add that tally.

Therefore, my final answer is 3 compounds.

Let\'s parse this. The compound has multiple rings possibly with bridge structures. Here, considering the stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS) and the E configuration for the chloromethylene group. Benzofuran derivatives with methano bridges could have multiple stereocenters. The presence of multiple stereogenic centers (at 3a and 7a) with specified configurations (R and S, respectively), plus the E geometry in the chloromethylene group (which is a double bond with substituents on opposite sides), suggests that unless there is an internal plane of symmetry, the molecule should be chiral. The question is if the overall structure, despite multiple stereocenters, has a plane of symmetry that would convert R/S into their enantiomers. Without looking at the exact structure, based on the given descriptors, if both 3aR and 7aS are different (i.e., not mirror images internally), and the E configuration adds another layer of stereogenic considerations. Assuming the compound does not have an internal plane of symmetry, it should be optically active. So, two stereocenters? Or maybe three? Regardless, combining their R/S and E configurations, unless the molecule is meso (unlikely given non-adjacent stereocenters), so probably it\'s chiral, hence optically active. So optical activity here: yes.\n\nThird compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. But this one is 2,3-dimethyl: HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The stereocenters at C2 and C3 being R and S. Let\'s check for an internal plane of symmetry. If one is R and the other S, would that create a meso compound? Succinic acid has a four-carbon chain. If substituted asymmetrically, but if they are R/S, depending on their configuration, is there a plane of symmetry?\n\nLooking at succinic acid\'s structure: places methyl groups on C2 and C3. For meso compounds, the configurations must be such that they are mirror images across a plane. If R and S configurations are on adjacent carbons, does that create a plane of symmetry?\n\nLet me draw it: C2 (R) has substituents: COOH, CH3, two Hs, and the adjacent C (C3). Similarly, C3 (S) has substituents: COOH, CH3, two Hs, and adjacent C (C2). If we imagine a plane bisecting between C2 and C3, then that would mirror the R configuration of C2 to the S configuration of C3. So, HOOC-CH(CH3) : CH(CH3)-COOH with one CH3 on each adjacent carbon but with opposite configurations. If the substituents are arranged so that each center is mirror of the other via the central plane, this would be a meso compound, hence having a plane of symmetry and no optical activity.\n\nTo confirm, meso-tartaric acid is a similar case with two stereocenters of R and S on adjacent carbons and two COOH groups. So here, (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid would be analogous to meso-tartaric acid. Therefore, it\'s a meso compound, hence not optically active despite two stereocenters. Therefore, answer is no.\n\nFourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Again, same as above but both stereocenters are R. Here, the two Rs: substituents at C2 and C3 are both R. If both are R, designing their configurations would lead to there being no internal plane of symmetry. Let\'s think: for each carbon, if the COOH, CH3, two H, and adjacent carbons. If each has R configuration, arranging both as R would make the two stereocenters each chiral and enantiomeric. But unless they have an internal plane due to the same R configuration, but being adjacent?\n\nWait, but with both as R, the molecule would not have any plane of symmetry. For example, in tartaric acid, the (R,R) and (S,S) forms are enantiomers (optically active), while (R,S) is meso. Therefore, in this case, (R,R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would not be meso. Hence, it doesn\'t have a plane of symmetry and should be optically active.\n\nSo, fourth compound: yes, optically active.\n\nFifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So R configuration at carbon 1. For cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the alcohol is on carbon 1, and cyclohexene has a double bond starting at carbon 3 (i.e., between C3 and C4). The molecule’s structure has a cyclohexene ring. Carbon 1 would be adjacent to the bridgehead (assuming numbering where 1 and 2 are adjacent). Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. For cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the hydroxyl is on carbon 1. The question is: However, is carbon 1 a chiral center?\n\nCarbon 1 is connected to the cyclohexene ring. Let\'s consider the structure. Carbon 1 in cyclohexanol is connected to two CH2 groups, the hydroxyl group, and the ring. Wait, maybe: The cyclohex-3-en-1-ol structure:\n\nPositions 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nIf the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (cyclohex-3-ene implies double bond from 3 to 4). Then, the alcohol is on carbon 1. Carbon 1 has substituents: the OH group, the ring (bridge to carbon 6 and carbon 2), a hydrogen (if applicable), and another substituent depending on the ring\'s structure. Wait, in cyclohexene ring, each carbon is part of the ring. So, carbon 1 would have substituents: two CH2 groups (if you imagine the chair), but in a cyclohexene ring, the carbons adjacent positions (e.g., 1, 2 would be adjacent in the ring). But carbon 1 would be connected to O-H, two carbons (from the ring- Carbons 6 and 2), and a hydrogen?\n\nSo the substituents would be:\n\nHydroxyl (OH), two adjacent cyclohexene carbons (each being part of the ring; C6 and C2), and a hydrogen. Thus, Carbon 1 would have groups: H, OH, C2 (ring), C6 (ring). If these C2 and C6 are in different positions in the ring, do they differ? Because the ring isn\'t symmetric. But in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, since there\'s a double bond from C3 to C4, the ring might not be symmetric.\n\nWait, the double bond affects the ring\'s symmetry. If the ring has a double bond starting at C3, then C3 and C4 are double-bonded, so carbons 2 and 5 would be adjacent to the double bond. Hence, carbon 1\'s substitution:\n\nThe molecule\'s symmetry may depend on where the double bond is placed. If there\'s a double bond between C3-C4, then the ring has different substituents.\n\nBut regardless of that, the key is whether there\'s a chiral center at C1. For a carbon to be chiral, it has to have four different substituents. C1 is connected to:\n\n- OH\n\n- C2 (which is part of the ring, maybe with different substituents due to the double bond)\n\n- C6 (another part of the ring, maybe different from C2).\n\n- Hydrogen?\n\nWait, perhaps, given the double bond\'s position, the environments of C2 and C6 are different. Therefore, C1\'s substituents are OH, H, C2 in a different part of the ring (with the double bond starting at C3), and C6. So since the groups around C1 would be different (due to the asymmetric double bond location), then C1 would indeed be a chiral center.\n\nSince the compound is specified as (R) configuration at carbon 1, that would confirm that it\'s a chiral molecule with no internal symmetry, as the cyclohexene ring induces different substituents. Therefore, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is chiral and should exhibit optical activity. One thing to question: is there a possibility of plane of symmetry making it meso? No, as the molecule doesn\'t have multiple stereocenters here—only the C1. So as a single stereocenter, unless there\'s some other symmetry, which I think the cyclohexene ring\'s double bond disrupts any plane symmetry. Therefore, this is optically active. So fifth compound: yes.\n\nSixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So three hydroxyl groups on the cyclohexane ring at positions 1,3,5, each with S configuration. Wait, but the configuration is labeled as \'s\'—is that lowercase s? Wait, the correct notation is with R and S uppercase. Maybe it\'s a typo in the question. Alternatively, it\'s indicating "s" for syn, but that\'s not a standard notation. Alternatively, perhaps it\'s specifically noting the chair conformation\'s axial or equatorial positions. But given that stereodescriptors are given in positions 1,3,5 as (1s,3s,5s), perhaps they are referring to some stereochemistry.\n\nBut wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with the hydroxyl groups in axial positions? Suppose. However, to determine whether it\'s chiral, we can think: does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If you have three hydroxyl groups on every other carbon (1,3,5), the molecule has C3 symmetry axis. If all the hydroxyl groups are in the same position (all axial or all equatorial), then does symmetry exist? If the substituents at 1,3,5 are all the same configuration (e.g., all axial), in that case, even-numbered substituents would have a plane of symmetry. For the 1,3,5-triol, if the hydroxy group arrangements are such that the three groups at 1,3,5 are arranged in a way that there\'s a plane of symmetry.\n\nMore straightforwardly, if the three hydroxyl groups are equally spaced (every other carbon) and all either axial or equatorial, the molecule would be meso if there\'s a plane or center of symmetry. For instance, in 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all methyl groups axial, there\'s a center of symmetry (each group mirrors the others through the center). So similarly, 1,3,5-triol would have inversion symmetry. Even though each stereocenter is S, there is a symmetry element (inversion center or planes) that superimposes the molecule on its mirror image. Therefore, the molecule would not be chiral. Despite having three stereocenters, if the symmetry elements cause the molecule to be achiral (due to "meso" scenario induced by symmetry), optical activity is absent.\n\nBut wait, if all three stereocenters have the same configuration (all S in this case), then when we consider the symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would be superimposable on its mirror image. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, if all OH groups are in axial positions, then drawing a line through the center of each opposite edge (perpendicular to the C3 axis) would act as a mirror plane. Therefore, each OH group is mirrored across the plane, making the entire molecule achiral. In such a case, even though each carbon is chiral with the same configuration, the molecule is a meso compound and not optically active.\n\nHowever, this depends on how the substituents arrange. If all three OH groups on the cyclohexane ring are on the same face (for example, all up), the chiral. If arranged symmetrically (e.g., axial or every other configuration), may create a symmetry plane. Alternatively, if each OH group is S configuration at carbons 1,3,5 in cyclohexane, can we have a symmetry?\n\nAssuming cyclohexane is chair-shaped, with three OH groups at 1,3,5 in axial positions: each lies on alternate axial positions. In a flat cyclohexane ring (not chair conformation), positions 1,3,5 are 120 degrees apart. With three OH groups, in a trigonal planar arrangement.\n\nWait, in chair conformation, axial positions alternate up and down. So substituents at 1,3,5 axial positions would be alternating up/down/up if the chair is alternating. Wait, maybe in actual, if three substituents are all axial but due to chair flipping or other factors, perhaps not.\n\nBut assuming planar cyclohexane for simplicity, if three OH groups are arranged symmetrically at 1,3,5, then the molecule would have multiple symmetry axes. The molecular plane could act as a symmetry plane in a planar structure, but cyclohexane is not planar. Overall, cyclohexane triols can be tricky—sometimes symmetrical in configurations even if individual stereocenters are set. So, a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane with all substituents the same configuration can actually be achiral if inversion symmetry present.\n\nSince each OH group\'s configuration is S at 1,3,5, then the mirror plane would invert their configurations. However, since they are all S, mirroring them should give R, but if the molecule’s symmetry includes a center of inversion, then each S configuration at 1 would be mirrored by another S at, say, the opposite side. Wait, but since there are substituents only at 1,3,5, then perhaps each S configuration would invert and lead to R, so possible that the compound is a racemic mix. No, not in this case.\n\nAlternatively, if after inversion, the point group differs—That might get complex. The correct approach is to determine if the molecule is symmetric enough to be achiral. Since all substituents (three OHs) are equally spaced, S configurations. If the substituent configurations combined with the symmetry elements exhaust the chirality.\n\nA classic example to compare is 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. If all three methyl groups are axial, the molecule has an inversion center and a C3 axis, making it meso. Hence, the molecule is achiral despite each substituent being a stereocenter. Similar logic applies here. Thus, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol (probably ment (1S,3S,5S)) would be a meso compound due to the center of symmetry (noted in many references that such triols are meso and hence not optically active). Therefore, sixth compound: not optically active.\n\nSeventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (four-carbon chain with ketone at the first carbon. But then substituents: 1-cyclopentyl presumably replaces a substituent on the ketone carbon. Wait, but butan-1-one is (R)-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, wait. Wait: "butan-1-one" is another name for methyl propan-2-one? No. Butan-1-one would be the ketone on the first carbon: butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2, but butanone is usually butan-2-one (methylacetone). But according to the name, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the \'butan-1-one\' part is carbonyl group at position 1 of a four-carbon chain. Ok.\n\nSo structure: O=C-O(Cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait that isn\'t right.\n\nWait, if you have butan-1-one, that would be:\n\nCO\n|\nCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3\n\nbut that\'s not possible since there\'s no chain beyond the carbonyl except the three methyl groups. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nFor butan-1-one, the carbonyl is at carbon 1. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.\n\nBut then, 1-cyclopentyl would be replacing a hydrogen on the same carbon as the ketone. However, there\'s a rule that the ketone is position 1. But maybe that\'s not possible since a ketone cannot have two substituents on the same carbon (like cyclopentyl and the ketone chain). Wait, that part is confusing. Let\'s reevaluate.\n\nThe correct name: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one indicates that on the butan-1-one skeleton, which is O=C-R, R being a propyl chain. Wait. Wait:\n\nButan-1-one means ketone on carbon 1. The butanone structure is:\n\nR-C(=O)-R\'\n\nFor butan-1-one, that means:\n\nCarbon positions: 1 2 3 4\n\nSo, the carbonyl group is on carbon 1. Therefore, the structure would have carbonyl carbon at 1, adjacent to carbon 2. If that\'s true, the ketone is at position 1, so the carbonyl group is attached to carbon 1, and then carbons 2, 3, and 4.\n\nBut ketones are R-CO-R\', where R and R\' are alkyl or aryl groups. For butan-1-one, that would need to have R and R\' with total 3 carbons. For example, if its structure is (cyclopentyl)-(methylpropyl) ketone? Wait, the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.\n\nWait, wait. Let\'s parse:\n\nThe suffix "butan-1-one" denotes the ketone group on carbon 1 of a four-carbon chain. Thus, the carbonyl group is at position 1.\n\nTherefore, the structure is:\n\nC(=O)(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3\n\nBreaking it down: The ketone (butan-1-one) has the carbonyl at carbon 1; substituents on carbon 1 are a cyclopentyl group and a propane chain (since "butan" implies four carbons: O=C- (next three carbons).\n\nBut butan-1-one would have the formula O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-? With the fourth carbon where?\n\nWait, confusion arises. Let\'s check IUPAC nomenclature. Butan-1-one would be impossible because the carbonyl group must be between two carbon groups. Unless the compound is (methylethyl) ketone, but butan-1-one would be impossible. Alternatively, perhaps 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is O=C(CCl)… but another way. Wait, we might be dealing with a incorrectly structured question here.\n\nAlternatively, realizing that the name is perhaps miswritten. If instead, it\'s butan-1-one (butanone-1), which is not possible, so perhaps the correct structure is butan-2-one. However, the way to validate is inspired by nomenclature.\n\nWait, carbonyl group can’t be on terminal carbon (i.e., position 1 of a chain) because that would be an aldehyde. A ketone requires the carbonyl carbon to be connected to two other carbons. Therefore, butan-1-one would have the carbonyl between carbon 1 and 2, making it more like an aldehyde (impossible for a ketone). Therefore, the name must be 2-butonanone, given that a four-carbon ketone. Hence, likely mistyped as butan-1-one instead of butan-2-one or propan-2-one.\n\nBut given the problem\'s phrasing, we accept the name as 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. If that must be accepted, we need to imagine the structure:\n\nCarbon chain of butan-1-one (though interiding that the ketone is on position 1, which is invalid. But for the sake of problem, the substituents would be 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. But accepting this is a thrombose, possibly structure:\n\nAssuming this compound has a ketone somehow on a primary carbon (ie, impossible structure chemically would have the molecular formula of (cyclopentyl)-(methylpropyl)ketone).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps carbon-1 in a four-carbon chain is the carbonyl, but that would be an aldehyde group. So this must be a typo. Alternatively, maybe a bicycle structure?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps designated as butanone with substituents:\n\nIf the structure is O=C-C(C3-methyl)-cyclopentyl... How exactly? Hmmm. Perhaps I need to correct the nomenclature, but since external sources can\'t be accessed, perhaps accept the name as given.\n\nAssuming that "1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one" is a valid name and has the structure where the ketone is at position one (which chemically can\'t exist as a ketone; maybe a error). However, proceeding regardless.\n\nIn the structure: The ketone is on carbon 1, cyclopentyl group also attached to carbon 1 (impossible, really, except if referring to a neighboring group. Mistake here? Maybe. Why in this name \'1-cyclopentyl\' suggest a substituent on carbon? But for the sake of the problem, trying to evaluate.\n\nIn this case, carbon 1 has a ketone group (=O) and a cyclopentyl group. Then carbon 3 has a methyl. The structure would be: O=C–CR(cyclopentyl)–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3. But not quite, since butan-1-one would have the formula O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3. To cyclopentyl substituent on position 1, we replace one of the hydrogen on the first carbon ( actually, the carbonyl carbon), but carbonyl carbons in ketones are already bonded to two alkyl groups, hence, adding a cyclopentyl to the first carbon (carbonyl) would imply three substituents (but ketones can’t have three, because of sp² hybridization). So structurally, is that possible? No. So perhaps some confusion here.\n\nAlternate explanation: The correct way, supposing the name should be 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one is somehow incorrect. Or perhaps the actual structure is cyclopentyl connected to carbon 2?\n\nDue to contradiction, perhaps this compound has no chiral centers. If confused about the structure, especially hydrogen mentioned. Let\'s consider possible chiral centers. Suppose that, despite the name issue, the carbon bearing the ketone (supposedly O=C) has a cyclopentyl substituent and a methyl branch. But assuming the sp² hybridized carbon, since it\'s a ketone, which cannot have a chiral center.\n\nAlternatively, even if confusing, but supposing that in butan-1-one, carbonyl is at position 1, then carbon 1 is part of the ketone and can\'t be a chiral center as it\'s double-bonded to oxygen. So we ignore that. The 3-methyl group is on carbon 3 of the butan chain. Since carbon 3 in butan-1\'s four carbons would be the third carbon, i.e, O=C–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–(whatever). If no other branching or substitution is present along with cyclopentyl.\n\nAlternatively, is there a chance that the cyclopentyl is attached to carbon 2 if it\'s butan-2-one. Let me check. Suppose the name is wrong and supposed to be butan-2-one, then structure would be O=C-CH(cyclopentyl)CH(CH3)2. But this is confused. Without knowing exactly the structure, but relying by name, assuming that regardless of the possible confusion, the question prods the student to check whether the compound has a chiral center. Without a clear stereogen, confusion in structure leads to correct analysis. For example, if the butan-1-one is impossible, but given as such, but has no chiral centers.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine which compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each for the presence of chiral centers and symmetry considerations:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**:  
   No chiral centers exist because the double bond carbon (C1) is sp² hybridized and cannot have four distinct substituents. **Not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**:  
   Contains multiple stereocenters (3aR, 7aS) and an E-configured double bond. No internal symmetry cancels chirality. **Optically active**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   Adjacent stereocenters (R and S) create a meso compound due to an internal plane of symmetry. **Not optically active**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**:  
   Adjacent stereocenters (R and R) lack internal symmetry. **Optically active**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**:  
   The hydroxyl-bearing carbon (C1) is chiral with four distinct substituents due to the asymmetric cyclohexene ring. **Optically active**.

6. **(1S,3S,5S)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**:  
   Three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 create a symmetric arrangement with a center of inversion. **Meso compound; not optically active**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**:  
   The ketone carbon is sp² hybridized and non-chiral. No other chiral centers exist. **Not optically active**.

**Optically active compounds**: 2, 4, 5.  
**Total**: $\boxed{3}$

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

ật complex. Let's parse this. The compound has multiple rings possibly with bridge structures. Here, considering the stereodescriptors (3aR,7aS) and the E configuration for the chloromethylene group. Benzofuran derivatives with methano bridges could have multiple stereocenters. The presence of multiple stereogenic centers (at 3a and 7a) with specified configurations (R and S, respectively), plus the E geometry in the chloromethylene group (which is a double bond with substituents on opposite sides), suggests that unless there is an internal plane of symmetry, the molecule should be chiral. The question is if the overall structure, despite multiple stereocenters, has a plane of symmetry that would convert R/S into their enantiomers. Without looking at the exact structure, based on the given descriptors, if both 3aR and 7aS are different (i.e., not mirror images internally), and the E configuration adds another layer of stereogenic considerations. Assuming the compound does not have an internal plane of symmetry, it should be optically active. So, two stereocenters? Or maybe three? Regardless, combining their R/S and E configurations, unless the molecule is meso (unlikely given non-adjacent stereocenters), so probably it's chiral, hence optically active. So optical activity here: yes.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. But this one is 2,3-dimethyl: HOOC-C(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The stereocenters at C2 and C3 being R and S. Let's check for an internal plane of symmetry. If one is R and the other S, would that create a meso compound? Succinic acid has a four-carbon chain. If substituted asymmetrically, but if they are R/S, depending on their configuration, is there a plane of symmetry?

Looking at succinic acid's structure: places methyl groups on C2 and C3. For meso compounds, the configurations must be such that they are mirror images across a plane. If R and S configurations are on adjacent carbons, does that create a plane of symmetry?

Let me draw it: C2 (R) has substituents: COOH, CH3, two Hs, and the adjacent C (C3). Similarly, C3 (S) has substituents: COOH, CH3, two Hs, and adjacent C (C2). If we imagine a plane bisecting between C2 and C3, then that would mirror the R configuration of C2 to the S configuration of C3. So, HOOC-CH(CH3) : CH(CH3)-COOH with one CH3 on each adjacent carbon but with opposite configurations. If the substituents are arranged so that each center is mirror of the other via the central plane, this would be a meso compound, hence having a plane of symmetry and no optical activity.

To confirm, meso-tartaric acid is a similar case with two stereocenters of R and S on adjacent carbons and two COOH groups. So here, (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid would be analogous to meso-tartaric acid. Therefore, it's a meso compound, hence not optically active despite two stereocenters. Therefore, answer is no.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Again, same as above but both stereocenters are R. Here, the two Rs: substituents at C2 and C3 are both R. If both are R, designing their configurations would lead to there being no internal plane of symmetry. Let's think: for each carbon, if the COOH, CH3, two H, and adjacent carbons. If each has R configuration, arranging both as R would make the two stereocenters each chiral and enantiomeric. But unless they have an internal plane due to the same R configuration, but being adjacent?

Wait, but with both as R, the molecule would not have any plane of symmetry. For example, in tartaric acid, the (R,R) and (S,S) forms are enantiomers (optically active), while (R,S) is meso. Therefore, in this case, (R,R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would not be meso. Hence, it doesn't have a plane of symmetry and should be optically active.

So, fourth compound: yes, optically active.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So R configuration at carbon 1. For cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the alcohol is on carbon 1, and cyclohexene has a double bond starting at carbon 3 (i.e., between C3 and C4). The molecule’s structure has a cyclohexene ring. Carbon 1 would be adjacent to the bridgehead (assuming numbering where 1 and 2 are adjacent). Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. For cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the hydroxyl is on carbon 1. The question is: However, is carbon 1 a chiral center?

Carbon 1 is connected to the cyclohexene ring. Let's consider the structure. Carbon 1 in cyclohexanol is connected to two CH2 groups, the hydroxyl group, and the ring. Wait, maybe: The cyclohex-3-en-1-ol structure:

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

If the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (cyclohex-3-ene implies double bond from 3 to 4). Then, the alcohol is on carbon 1. Carbon 1 has substituents: the OH group, the ring (bridge to carbon 6 and carbon 2), a hydrogen (if applicable), and another substituent depending on the ring's structure. Wait, in cyclohexene ring, each carbon is part of the ring. So, carbon 1 would have substituents: two CH2 groups (if you imagine the chair), but in a cyclohexene ring, the carbons adjacent positions (e.g., 1, 2 would be adjacent in the ring). But carbon 1 would be connected to O-H, two carbons (from the ring- Carbons 6 and 2), and a hydrogen?

So the substituents would be:

Hydroxyl (OH), two adjacent cyclohexene carbons (each being part of the ring; C6 and C2), and a hydrogen. Thus, Carbon 1 would have groups: H, OH, C2 (ring), C6 (ring). If these C2 and C6 are in different positions in the ring, do they differ? Because the ring isn't symmetric. But in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, since there's a double bond from C3 to C4, the ring might not be symmetric.

Wait, the double bond affects the ring's symmetry. If the ring has a double bond starting at C3, then C3 and C4 are double-bonded, so carbons 2 and 5 would be adjacent to the double bond. Hence, carbon 1's substitution:

The molecule's symmetry may depend on where the double bond is placed. If there's a double bond between C3-C4, then the ring has different substituents.

But regardless of that, the key is whether there's a chiral center at C1. For a carbon to be chiral, it has to have four different substituents. C1 is connected to:

- OH

- C2 (which is part of the ring, maybe with different substituents due to the double bond)

- C6 (another part of the ring, maybe different from C2).

- Hydrogen?

Wait, perhaps, given the double bond's position, the environments of C2 and C6 are different. Therefore, C1's substituents are OH, H, C2 in a different part of the ring (with the double bond starting at C3), and C6. So since the groups around C1 would be different (due to the asymmetric double bond location), then C1 would indeed be a chiral center.

Since the compound is specified as (R) configuration at carbon 1, that would confirm that it's a chiral molecule with no internal symmetry, as the cyclohexene ring induces different substituents. Therefore, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is chiral and should exhibit optical activity. One thing to question: is there a possibility of plane of symmetry making it meso? No, as the molecule doesn't have multiple stereocenters here—only the C1. So as a single stereocenter, unless there's some other symmetry, which I think the cyclohexene ring's double bond disrupts any plane symmetry. Therefore, this is optically active. So fifth compound: yes.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So three hydroxyl groups on the cyclohexane ring at positions 1,3,5, each with S configuration. Wait, but the configuration is labeled as 's'—is that lowercase s? Wait, the correct notation is with R and S uppercase. Maybe it's a typo in the question. Alternatively, it's indicating "s" for syn, but that's not a standard notation. Alternatively, perhaps it's specifically noting the chair conformation's axial or equatorial positions. But given that stereodescriptors are given in positions 1,3,5 as (1s,3s,5s), perhaps they are referring to some stereochemistry.

But wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with the hydroxyl groups in axial positions? Suppose. However, to determine whether it's chiral, we can think: does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If you have three hydroxyl groups on every other carbon (1,3,5), the molecule has C3 symmetry axis. If all the hydroxyl groups are in the same position (all axial or all equatorial), then does symmetry exist? If the substituents at 1,3,5 are all the same configuration (e.g., all axial), in that case, even-numbered substituents would have a plane of symmetry. For the 1,3,5-triol, if the hydroxy group arrangements are such that the three groups at 1,3,5 are arranged in a way that there's a plane of symmetry.

More straightforwardly, if the three hydroxyl groups are equally spaced (every other carbon) and all either axial or equatorial, the molecule would be meso if there's a plane or center of symmetry. For instance, in 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane with all methyl groups axial, there's a center of symmetry (each group mirrors the others through the center). So similarly, 1,3,5-triol would have inversion symmetry. Even though each stereocenter is S, there is a symmetry element (inversion center or planes) that superimposes the molecule on its mirror image. Therefore, the molecule would not be chiral. Despite having three stereocenters, if the symmetry elements cause the molecule to be achiral (due to "meso" scenario induced by symmetry), optical activity is absent.

But wait, if all three stereocenters have the same configuration (all S in this case), then when we consider the symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would be superimposable on its mirror image. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol, if all OH groups are in axial positions, then drawing a line through the center of each opposite edge (perpendicular to the C3 axis) would act as a mirror plane. Therefore, each OH group is mirrored across the plane, making the entire molecule achiral. In such a case, even though each carbon is chiral with the same configuration, the molecule is a meso compound and not optically active.

However, this depends on how the substituents arrange. If all three OH groups on the cyclohexane ring are on the same face (for example, all up), the chiral. If arranged symmetrically (e.g., axial or every other configuration), may create a symmetry plane. Alternatively, if each OH group is S configuration at carbons 1,3,5 in cyclohexane, can we have a symmetry?

Assuming cyclohexane is chair-shaped, with three OH groups at 1,3,5 in axial positions: each lies on alternate axial positions. In a flat cyclohexane ring (not chair conformation), positions 1,3,5 are 120 degrees apart. With three OH groups, in a trigonal planar arrangement.

Wait, in chair conformation, axial positions alternate up and down. So substituents at 1,3,5 axial positions would be alternating up/down/up if the chair is alternating. Wait, maybe in actual, if three substituents are all axial but due to chair flipping or other factors, perhaps not.

But assuming planar cyclohexane for simplicity, if three OH groups are arranged symmetrically at 1,3,5, then the molecule would have multiple symmetry axes. The molecular plane could act as a symmetry plane in a planar structure, but cyclohexane is not planar. Overall, cyclohexane triols can be tricky—sometimes symmetrical in configurations even if individual stereocenters are set. So, a 1,3,5-trisubstituted cyclohexane with all substituents the same configuration can actually be achiral if inversion symmetry present.

Since each OH group's configuration is S at 1,3,5, then the mirror plane would invert their configurations. However, since they are all S, mirroring them should give R, but if the molecule’s symmetry includes a center of inversion, then each S configuration at 1 would be mirrored by another S at, say, the opposite side. Wait, but since there are substituents only at 1,3,5, then perhaps each S configuration would invert and lead to R, so possible that the compound is a racemic mix. No, not in this case.

Alternatively, if after inversion, the point group differs—That might get complex. The correct approach is to determine if the molecule is symmetric enough to be achiral. Since all substituents (three OHs) are equally spaced, S configurations. If the substituent configurations combined with the symmetry elements exhaust the chirality.

A classic example to compare is 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. If all three methyl groups are axial, the molecule has an inversion center and a C3 axis, making it meso. Hence, the molecule is achiral despite each substituent being a stereocenter. Similar logic applies here. Thus, (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol (probably ment (1S,3S,5S)) would be a meso compound due to the center of symmetry (noted in many references that such triols are meso and hence not optically active). Therefore, sixth compound: not optically active.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a butanone (four-carbon chain with ketone at the first carbon. But then substituents: 1-cyclopentyl presumably replaces a substituent on the ketone carbon. Wait, but butan-1-one is (R)-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, wait. Wait: "butan-1-one" is another name for methyl propan-2-one? No. Butan-1-one would be the ketone on the first carbon: butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2, but butanone is usually butan-2-one (methylacetone). But according to the name, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the 'butan-1-one' part is carbonyl group at position 1 of a four-carbon chain. Ok.

So structure: O=C-O(Cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait that isn't right.

Wait, if you have butan-1-one, that would be:

CO
|
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

but that's not possible since there's no chain beyond the carbonyl except the three methyl groups. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe:

For butan-1-one, the carbonyl is at carbon 1. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But then, 1-cyclopentyl would be replacing a hydrogen on the same carbon as the ketone. However, there's a rule that the ketone is position 1. But maybe that's not possible since a ketone cannot have two substituents on the same carbon (like cyclopentyl and the ketone chain). Wait, that part is confusing. Let's reevaluate.

The correct name: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one indicates that on the butan-1-one skeleton, which is O=C-R, R being a propyl chain. Wait. Wait:

Butan-1-one means ketone on carbon 1. The butanone structure is:

R-C(=O)-R'

For butan-1-one, that means:

Carbon positions: 1 2 3 4

So, the carbonyl group is on carbon 1. Therefore, the structure would have carbonyl carbon at 1, adjacent to carbon 2. If that's true, the ketone is at position 1, so the carbonyl group is attached to carbon 1, and then carbons 2, 3, and 4.

But ketones are R-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. For butan-1-one, that would need to have R and R' with total 3 carbons. For example, if its structure is (cyclopentyl)-(methylpropyl) ketone? Wait, the name is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

Wait, wait. Let's parse:

The suffix "butan-1-one" denotes the ketone group on carbon 1 of a four-carbon chain. Thus, the carbonyl group is at position 1.

Therefore, the structure is:

C(=O)(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Breaking it down: The ketone (butan-1-one) has the carbonyl at carbon 1; substituents on carbon 1 are a cyclopentyl group and a propane chain (since "butan" implies four carbons: O=C- (next three carbons).

But butan-1-one would have the formula O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-? With the fourth carbon where?

Wait, confusion arises. Let's check IUPAC nomenclature. Butan-1-one would be impossible because the carbonyl group must be between two carbon groups. Unless the compound is (methylethyl) ketone, but butan-1-one would be impossible. Alternatively, perhaps 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is O=C(CCl)… but another way. Wait, we might be dealing with a incorrectly structured question here.

Alternatively, realizing that the name is perhaps miswritten. If instead, it's butan-1-one (butanone-1), which is not possible, so perhaps the correct structure is butan-2-one. However, the way to validate is inspired by nomenclature.

Wait, carbonyl group can’t be on terminal carbon (i.e., position 1 of a chain) because that would be an aldehyde. A ketone requires the carbonyl carbon to be connected to two other carbons. Therefore, butan-1-one would have the carbonyl between carbon 1 and 2, making it more like an aldehyde (impossible for a ketone). Therefore, the name must be 2-butonanone, given that a four-carbon ketone. Hence, likely mistyped as butan-1-one instead of butan-2-one or propan-2-one.

But given the problem's phrasing, we accept the name as 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. If that must be accepted, we need to imagine the structure:

Carbon chain of butan-1-one (though interiding that the ketone is on position 1, which is invalid. But for the sake of problem, the substituents would be 1-cyclopentyl and 3-methyl. But accepting this is a thrombose, possibly structure:

Assuming this compound has a ketone somehow on a primary carbon (ie, impossible structure chemically would have the molecular formula of (cyclopentyl)-(methylpropyl)ketone).

Alternatively, perhaps carbon-1 in a four-carbon chain is the carbonyl, but that would be an aldehyde group. So this must be a typo. Alternatively, maybe a bicycle structure?

Alternatively, perhaps designated as butanone with substituents:

If the structure is O=C-C(C3-methyl)-cyclopentyl... How exactly? Hmmm. Perhaps I need to correct the nomenclature, but since external sources can't be accessed, perhaps accept the name as given.

Assuming that "1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one" is a valid name and has the structure where the ketone is at position one (which chemically can't exist as a ketone; maybe a error). However, proceeding regardless.

In the structure: The ketone is on carbon 1, cyclopentyl group also attached to carbon 1 (impossible, really, except if referring to a neighboring group. Mistake here? Maybe. Why in this name '1-cyclopentyl' suggest a substituent on carbon? But for the sake of the problem, trying to evaluate.

In this case, carbon 1 has a ketone group (=O) and a cyclopentyl group. Then carbon 3 has a methyl. The structure would be: O=C–CR(cyclopentyl)–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3. But not quite, since butan-1-one would have the formula O=C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3. To cyclopentyl substituent on position 1, we replace one of the hydrogen on the first carbon ( actually, the carbonyl carbon), but carbonyl carbons in ketones are already bonded to two alkyl groups, hence, adding a cyclopentyl to the first carbon (carbonyl) would imply three substituents (but ketones can’t have three, because of sp² hybridization). So structurally, is that possible? No. So perhaps some confusion here.

Alternate explanation: The correct way, supposing the name should be 3-methyl-1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one is somehow incorrect. Or perhaps the actual structure is cyclopentyl connected to carbon 2?

Due to contradiction, perhaps this compound has no chiral centers. If confused about the structure, especially hydrogen mentioned. Let's consider possible chiral centers. Suppose that, despite the name issue, the carbon bearing the ketone (supposedly O=C) has a cyclopentyl substituent and a methyl branch. But assuming the sp² hybridized carbon, since it's a ketone, which cannot have a chiral center.

Alternatively, even if confusing, but supposing that in butan-1-one, carbonyl is at position 1, then carbon 1 is part of the ketone and can't be a chiral center as it's double-bonded to oxygen. So we ignore that. The 3-methyl group is on carbon 3 of the butan chain. Since carbon 3 in butan-1's four carbons would be the third carbon, i.e, O=C–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–(whatever). If no other branching or substitution is present along with cyclopentyl.

Alternatively, is there a chance that the cyclopentyl is attached to carbon 2 if it's butan-2-one. Let me check. Suppose the name is wrong and supposed to be butan-2-one, then structure would be O=C-CH(cyclopentyl)CH(CH3)2. But this is confused. Without knowing exactly the structure, but relying by name, assuming that regardless of the possible confusion, the question prods the student to check whether the compound has a chiral center. Without a clear stereogen, confusion in structure leads to correct analysis. For example, if the butan-1-one is impossible, but given as such, but has no chiral centers. If the carbonyl group is trapped in structure, not chiral. Furthermore, the methyl branch at carbon 2—wait, if no, but need to see correct placements. 

Alternatively maybe the compound is cyclopentyl attached to carbon 1 (non-stereogenic), methyl attached to carbon 3. The ketone at carbon 1 would make that carbon unable to have additional substituents (due to double bond), but perhaps as vicinal. Another guess is structure may be butan-3-one-1-cyclopentyl. However, without the ability to visualize, hard to say. Given the uncertainty, assuming that the molecule doesnt have any chiral centers. Maybe suggesting optical inactivity because no chiral centers. Therefore, seventh compound: No.

But it's possible I might have made a wrong assumption if the structure inadvertently includes a chiral center due to substituent location. But based on the confused name, maybe safer to correct và conclude no optical activity. 

Recapping analysis results:

1. (Z)-… : No
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-… : Yes
3. (2R,3S)-… : No (meso)
4. (2R,3R)-… : Yes
5. (R)-… : Yes
6. (1s,3s,5s)-… : No (meso)
7. 1-cyclopentyl… : Probably No

Thus, out of the seven compounds, numbers 2,4,5 are optically active, so a total of three.

But let me confirm:

Wait, (check step analysis)

Compound 2: Yes.

Compound 3: No (meso).

Compound 4: Yes.

Compound 5: Yes.

Compound 6: No (meso).

Compound 7: No.

Therefore, 3 compounds out of 7. So the answer is 3.
