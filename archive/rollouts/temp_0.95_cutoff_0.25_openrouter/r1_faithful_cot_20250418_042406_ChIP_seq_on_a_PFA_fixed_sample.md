# Original Question

ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

The disappearing ChIP-seq peaks observed when transitioning from PFA-only to PFA+DSG fixation are most likely located in **genomic regions where IKAROS is indirectly associated with DNA through protein-protein interactions** rather than binding DNA directly. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Fixation Differences**:
   - **PFA (paraformaldehyde)** primarily crosslinks proteins to DNA and nearby proteins. This can capture indirect associations, such as IKAROS being part of a complex near DNA-bound proteins.
   - **DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate)** strengthens protein-protein crosslinks. When combined with PFA, it stabilizes complexes but may obscure epitopes or generate large aggregates that interfere with ChIP efficiency.

2. **Mechanism of Peak Disappearance**:
   - **Indirect Binding**: In PFA-only fixation, IKAROS might appear to be "bound" to DNA if it is part of a protein complex interacting with a DNA-binding partner. These indirect interactions are not stabilized by direct DNA binding.
   - **Epitope Masking/Crosslinking Artifacts**: DSG’s extensive protein-protein crosslinking may bury the IKAROS epitope (preventing antibody binding) or create overly large complexes that are lost during sonication or immunoprecipitation steps.
   - **Reduced Shearing Efficiency**: Stabilized complexes could result in DNA fragments too large for sequencing library preparation, leading to loss of signal at these loci.

3. **Outcome**:
   - True IKAROS binding sites (direct DNA interactions) would persist across fixation methods. 
   - Peaks disappearing with DSG likely represent **false positives** from PFA-only experiments—regions where IKAROS is tethered to DNA via other proteins (e.g., transcriptional co-factors or chromatin remodelers) rather than binding DNA itself.

**Conclusion**: The disappearing peaks are enriched in regions where IKAROS associates with chromatin indirectly through protein-protein interactions, and the improved crosslinking with DSG eliminates these artifactual signals. This highlights the importance of optimizing fixation methods to distinguish direct DNA binding from indirect associations.

Okay, so the question is about ChIP-seq experiments where using PFA-fixed samples with an antibody against IKAROS in human B cells leads to detectable peaks, but when they use PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappear. And we need to figure out where those disappearing peaks are most likely located. Hmm.

First, I need to remember what ChIP-seq does. ChIP-seq is used to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins, like transcription factors. The process involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, shearing the DNA into small fragments, immunoprecipitating with an antibody specific to the protein of interest, and then sequencing the DNA fragments to find where the protein binds.

The question mentions two different fixation methods: PFA-only and PFA+DSG. PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a common crosslinker that forms protein-protein and protein-DNA crosslinks, primarily fixing proteins that are close to DNA. DSG is disuccinimidyl glutarate, a homobifunctional crosslinker that primarily crosslinks proteins that are in close proximity to each other, like those in protein complexes.

So, when using PFA alone, you get crosslinks between DNA and proteins that are directly interacting with DNA. When you add DSG, which stabilizes protein-protein interactions, maybe the crosslinking becomes more efficient for proteins that are part of complexes but not directly binding DNA. But wait, in this case, the peaks disappear when DSG is added. That suggests that maybe the original peaks in PFA-only were not true binding sites. Alternatively, the addition of DSG could be causing some issues with the accessibility of the antibody, or perhaps over-crosslinking leading to epitope masking.

Alternatively, maybe DSG stabilizes interactions that prevent some crosslinking of IKAROS to DNA. Or perhaps the original peaks were from indirect binding. IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in lymphocyte development. If the antibody for IKAROS in the PFA-only samples was crosslinking IKAROS that's part of a larger complex, maybe when you use DSG, the crosslinking is altered such that IKAROS is crosslinked to other proteins and not to DNA, so when you sonicate the DNA, the IKAROS is not attached to the DNA anymore? Wait, but in ChIP, after crosslinking, the DNA is sheared, so if the protein is crosslinked to DNA, even if it's part of a complex, the DNA should be co-precipitated. Maybe with DSG, there's more crosslinking of the proteins so that the antibody can't bind as effectively? Maybe the epitope is masked by the additional crosslinks from DSG. So in that case, the peaks that disappear are not real binding sites because the antibody is not working as well when you add DSG. But then, why did they get peaks in PFA alone? Maybe in PFA alone, the antibody has better access, but some crosslinks are not stable, or maybe the crosslinking with DSG plus PFA causes some conformational changes. Wait, but the standard practice for some factors is to use DSG in addition to PFA. For example, for some transcription factors that are not efficiently crosslinked by PFA alone. So if an antibody works better with DSG, but in this case, when they add DSG, the peaks disappear, that makes me think maybe those peaks were not genuine IKAROS binding sites. 

Maybe the original peaks in PFA-only were the result of indirect associations, like IKAROS being part of a complex that is near the DNA but not directly binding, so when you use DSG, which crosslinks proteins more, the DNA shearing doesn't co-purify those regions because the direct DNA contacts are missing. Alternatively, when you use DSG, the crosslinking is better for proteins in the complex, but if IKAROS is not directly bound to DNA, then the DNA nearby might not get crosslinked. Wait, but typically, transcription factors like IKAROS directly bind DNA. So maybe there's another layer here. Maybe in the case where you use DSG, you're getting better fixation of the chromatin structure, and so some of the open chromatin regions that were being non-specifically pulled down in PFA alone are better fixed with DSG, reducing background. But the peaks are disappearing, so if the real peaks should stay, but they disappear, maybe those peaks were false positives in the PFA-only experiment.

Alternatively, maybe IKAROS interacts with DNA indirectly through another protein. For example, if IKAROS is part of a complex where another protein binds DNA directly, and IKAROS is just attached to that protein. With PFA alone, maybe the crosslinking isn't strong enough to link IKAROS to DNA through the other protein. Wait, no, in ChIP, the idea is that you crosslink the protein to DNA. If the protein is part of a complex, but you're crosslinking that complex to DNA. But if the complex isn't directly binding DNA, maybe those crosslinks aren't formed. Maybe IKAROS is interacting with another DNA-binding protein. Perhaps when using PFA, which crosslinks proteins in close proximity to DNA, you might get IKAROS crosslinked even if it's not directly binding DNA. Adding DSG could crosslink more proteins in the complex, making it harder to shear the DNA near IKAROS. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the disappearance of peaks with DSG implies that the original peaks in PFA-only were found in regions of high transcriptional activity where the chromatin is more open, and maybe those regions are more susceptible to crosslinking without DSG, but adding DSG stabilizes the proteins in a way that masks those regions. Alternatively, DSG may inhibit some steps in the ChIP process. But why would that cause specific peaks to disappear?

Another thought: DSG could stabilize interactions between IKAROS and other proteins, leading to larger complexes that are not efficiently pelleted during centrifugation steps, so the DNA bound to those complexes is lost. But that would cause loss of signal in general, not specific peaks.

Wait, maybe the real answer is that those disappearing peaks are in regions where IKAROS is indirectly associated with DNA through protein-protein interactions with another DNA-binding protein. So in PFA-only fixation, the crosslinking may capture IKAROS that's near DNA due to interactions with another protein, but when you use DSG, which creates stronger protein-protein crosslinks, perhaps the complex is stabilized such that during sonication, the DNA isn't sheared properly around the actual binding sites. Wait, but if IKAROS is part of a complex that's not directly bound to DNA, even with DSG, the DNA wouldn't get co-precipitated. Alternatively, maybe in DSG+PFA, there's over-crosslinking, which makes it harder to extract the DNA-protein complexes, leading to loss of signal.

Alternatively, maybe the disappearing peaks correspond to weaker binding sites or indirect interactions. For example, regions where IKAROS doesn't directly bind DNA but is tethered through another protein. In PFA, maybe some crosslinking occurs between IKAROS and DNA via the other protein, but when you add DSG, the crosslinking between IKAROS and the other protein is so strong that it doesn't allow the DNA to be sheared properly, leading to larger fragments that are lost during the sonication or not amplified properly in sequencing. Or the epitope for the antibody becomes inaccessible due to crosslinks from DSG.

Alternatively, maybe DSG stabilizes the protein complexes so effectively that the IKAROS antibody can't bind as well, perhaps through the crosslinking causing steric hindrance. That would reduce the IP efficiency, leading to loss of signal. But why would some peaks remain and others disappear? Maybe the real binding sites have higher affinity, so they still get pulled down even with lower efficiency, whereas the false peaks from crosslinking artifacts go away when you fix better. Wait, this is conflicting. If DSG is making the fixation better, maybe the true peaks would stay and false peaks from poor fixation (like transient interactions) would disappear. However, here the peaks disappear when DSG is added, suggesting that in PFA alone, they might be false positives. So maybe the disappearing peaks are from regions where IKAROS is not actually binding DNA but just nearby due to being in a complex, and the DSG helps eliminate those.

Wait, but if you're using an antibody specific to IKAROS, shouldn't it only pull down DNA where IKAROS is crosslinked to it? So if IKAROS is part of a complex that's near DNA, but not directly binding, perhaps in PFA only, the crosslinking happens when IKAROS is near DNA due to the protein's proximity, even without a direct DNA interaction. Adding DSG, which crosslinks proteins more, might pull IKAROS away from the DNA by crosslinking it to other proteins in the complex, preventing the DNA from being attached? Not sure.

Another angle: PFA forms protein-DNA crosslinks via formaldehyde's ability to create methylene bridges between amino groups in proteins and DNA. DSG, being a homobifunctional crosslinker with NHS esters, targets primary amines (like lysine residues) and crosslinks adjacent proteins. If DSG is used with PFA, the crosslinking becomes more extensive. If IKAROS interacts with DNA directly, then both PFA and DSG+PFA would crosslink it. But maybe when you use DSG, some epitopes necessary for the antibody recognition are blocked, leading to failure in immunoprecipitation. However, that would suggest that all peaks vanish, but the question states that some peaks "disappeared," implying only a subset. So maybe true peaks remain, but false peaks vanish. Alternatively, those peaks that disappear are in heterochromatic regions. But how does DSG affect that?

Wait, another thought: DSG stabilizes interactions between proteins. In some cases, transcription factors bind DNA as part of a multi-protein complex. If the complex is stabilized by DSG, perhaps the DNA shearing is less efficient in capturing the binding sites. For example, if DNA is sheared into smaller fragments, and crosslinking is too extensive, maybe larger complexes are formed that are not properly sonicated, leading to loss of those fragments during the size selection step. In regions where the crosslinking is too tight, the DNA might not be sheared into the appropriate size range for sequencing. Therefore, the peaks that disappear might be in regions where the crosslinking with DSG is too strong, making the DNA-protein complexes too large to shear, leading to loss of signal. However, the question states that when using DSG+PFA, the peaks disappeared, so perhaps these are regions where IKAROS is part of a complex that is crosslinked more extensively, so the DNA isn't sheared properly. But why would that happen only in some regions? Maybe in open chromatin regions, the DNA is more accessible to sonication even with crosslinking, but in closed chromatin, crosslinking with DSG makes it difficult. Hmm, this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, the real answer could be that the disappearing peaks were from regions where IKAROS was binding indirectly via other proteins—so, in a complex where another protein is actually binding DNA, and IKAROS is just interacting with that protein. In PFA alone, the formaldehyde may crosslink IKAROS to the DNA-bound protein, thereby allowing the DNA to be immunoprecipitated with IKAROS. However, when DSG is added, the protein-protein crosslinking is so strong that it masks the IKAROS epitope (due to crosslinking to nearby proteins), making the antibody less effective, leading to loss of those peaks. Thus, these disappearing peaks indicate regions where IKAROS is not directly binding DNA but is interacting with a DNA-bound protein, so the true DNA-bound protein's peaks might still be there, but IKAROS's peaks vanish when DSG is used because the antibody can't access IKAROS anymore.

Alternatively, DSG could be causing more crosslinking of other proteins that are competing for binding with IKAROS. Not sure. 

Another possibility: IKAROS may form different complexes. In PFA, maybe soluble IKAROS can access the DNA and crosslink, whereas when DSG is added, maybe the protein is crosslinked in a way that it's sequestered from DNA. But that seems less likely. 

I think the key here is the difference between direct DNA binding and indirect tethering. If a transcription factor is directly binding DNA, PFA should crosslink it, and DSG may help stabilize any protein complexes around it but shouldn't eliminate the DNA-protein crosslink. However, if the TF is indirectly associated with DNA via another protein, then with PFA alone, some crosslinking might occur, but adding DSG stabilizes the protein interactions, making the complex too large or making the epitope unavailable, causing the loss of the peaks. 

Therefore, the disappearing peaks are most likely located in regions where IKAROS is tethered to DNA indirectly via interactions with other DNA-binding proteins. So, the answer would be that the disappearing peaks are found in regions where IKAROS interacts indirectly with DNA through other proteins, such as being part of a protein complex where another protein is the actual DNA binder. When DSG is added, the protein-protein crosslinks are enhanced, possibly masking the epitope or making the complexes too large, such that the ChIP-seq no longer picks up those regions. 

In standard ChIP protocols, especially for transcription factors that work in complexes, using DSG can help improve signal by stabilizing complexes. However, if peaks disappear when DSG is added, it might indicate that those peaks were artifacts in the PFA-only condition. The genuine direct binding sites would still be present, but the indirect ones would vanish. Therefore, the peaks that disappear are likely in genomic regions where IKAROS is not directly binding DNA but is part of a complex that interacts with DNA through another protein.

Regarding the ChIP-seq experiments with IKAROS in human B cells, we see an interesting phenomenon where peaks detectable with PFA fixation disappear when using PFA plus DSG fixation. This raises questions about where these disappearing peaks are most likely located.

To understand this, I should review what ChIP-seq does. It identifies DNA binding sites of proteins like transcription factors by crosslinking proteins to DNA, fragmenting the DNA, using antibodies to immunoprecipitate the protein of interest, and sequencing the associated DNA fragments.

The fixation methods differ significantly: PFA (paraformaldehyde) creates protein-DNA and protein-protein crosslinks, primarily fixing proteins near DNA. DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) mainly crosslinks proteins to other proteins, stabilizing protein complexes.

When peaks disappear with DSG addition, several possibilities emerge. Perhaps the original PFA-only peaks weren't true binding sites. Or maybe DSG causes issues with antibody accessibility or creates excessive crosslinking that masks epitopes.

Another possibility is that DSG alters interactions in a way that prevents IKAROS from crosslinking to DNA. Or perhaps the original peaks resulted from indirect binding. Since IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in lymphocyte development, if it was part of a larger complex in the PFA-only samples, DSG might change the crosslinking pattern, linking IKAROS to other proteins rather than DNA.

However, in ChIP protocols, after crosslinking, DNA is sheared, so proteins crosslinked to DNA (even as part of complexes) should co-precipitate with DNA fragments. Maybe DSG creates so many protein crosslinks that the antibody can't bind effectively because the epitope is obscured.

Interestingly, for some transcription factors, using DSG with PFA is standard practice because some factors aren't efficiently crosslinked by PFA alone. The fact that IKAROS peaks disappear with DSG suggests these might not be genuine binding sites.

Perhaps the PFA-only peaks resulted from indirect associations, with IKAROS being part of a complex near DNA but not directly binding. When DSG is added, this would change how the complex is crosslinked.

The question concerns ChIP-seq experiments using PFA-fixed samples with an antibody against IKAROS in human B cells, resulting in detectable peaks. However, when PFA is combined with DSG fixation, these peaks vanish. We need to determine where those disappearing peaks might be located.

First, let's recall the purpose of ChIP-seq: it identifies the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins, such as transcription factors. The procedure involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, fragmenting the DNA, using an antibody specific to the target protein for immunoprecipitation, and sequencing the DNA fragments to identify protein binding sites.

The question refers to two fixation methods: PFA-only and PFA+DSG. PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is commonly used to crosslink proteins closely associated with DNA. DSG, or disuccinimidyl glutarate, is another crosslinker that primarily secures interactions between proteins in close proximity, such as those within complexes.

Using only PFA results in crosslinks between DNA and proteins directly interacting with it. However, the addition of DSG, stabilizing protein-protein interactions, might enhance crosslinking efficiency for proteins in complexes that don't directly bind DNA. But here, the peaks vanish with DSG, suggesting the initial PFA-only peaks may not be true binding sites. Alternatively, DSG might affect antibody accessibility or result in excessive crosslinking, leading to epitope masking.

It's possible DSG stabilizes interactions impeding IKAROS from crosslinking to DNA, or the initial peaks were from indirect binding. Given IKAROS’s role as a transcription factor in lymphocyte development, if the antibody in PFA-only samples captured IKAROS within a larger complex, DSG might alter crosslinking so IKAROS connects to other proteins rather than DNA. Therefore, once DNA is fragmented, IKAROS isn’t linked to the DNA anymore. Although in ChIP, if the protein is DNA-crosslinked, even within a complex, it should co-precipitate with sheared DNA. DSG might cause increased protein-protein crosslinking, reducing antibody binding efficiency, possibly masking epitopes with additional DSG crosslinks. Consequently, the disappearing peaks may not be authentic binding sites, as the antibody is less effective with DSG.

So why were peaks found with PFA alone? Perhaps PFA alone allows better antibody access, though some crosslinks aren't stable. Alternatively, DSG combined with PFA might induce conformational changes. Notably, standard practice for some factors includes DSG with PFA to enhance crosslinking efficiency. If an antibody typically performs better with DSG, yet peaks disappear here, it suggests those peaks weren't authentic IKAROS binding sites. The original PFA-only peaks could result from indirect associations, with IKAROS within a complex near DNA but not directly bound, and DSG changes those interactions.

So in the original case (PFA only), maybe the peaks are non-specific or from cross-reactive antibodies. But why would DSG affect that? Maybe the DSG alters the epitope? Or perhaps the real binding sites are better crosslinked with DSG, but the antibody works better without DSG. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, if the peaks disappear when using DSG, which stabilizes protein-protein interactions, perhaps the peaks in the PFA-only case were due to transient or indirect interactions. So IKAROS might be part of a complex that is near the DNA but not actually binding DNA. PFA crosslinks proteins that are close to DNA, but if the factor is not directly binding DNA, maybe the crosslinking is not as effective. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me backtrack.\n\nIn a typical ChIP-seq, factors that directly bind DNA are crosslinked by PFA. Proteins that are part of a complex but not directly DNA-bound may not be crosslinked as effectively. If you add DSG, which crosslinks proteins within a complex, maybe you can pull down proteins that are part of a complex but not DNA-bound. Wait, but how would that affect the DNA association? For example, if IKAROS is part of a multi-protein complex that is associated with DNA via another protein, then using DSG would crosslink the complex, so when you sonicate, the DNA attached to the complex would be co-purified even if IKAROS isn't directly binding DNA. So perhaps in the case of PFA only, the crosslinks are weak for that complex, so IKAROS is not efficiently crosslinked to DNA. But if you add DSG, you stabilize the complex, making the crosslinking more efficient, leading to better ChIP signals. But in the question, the opposite is happening: the peaks disappear when DSG is added.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reverse is true. The disappearing peaks in PFA+DSG might be because DSG is causing crosslinks that interfere with the antibody's ability to recognize IKAROS. For example, the antibody might recognize an epitope that is occluded when IKAROS is crosslinked to other proteins via DSG. If that's the case, the original peaks in PFA-only might be real binding sites where the antibody could access IKAROS, but when you add DSG, those sites are masked, leading to loss of signal. However, this would suggest that the disappearing peaks are genuine binding sites, but that doesn't seem right because then DSG would be a bad choice, but often DSG is used for better crosslinking. Alternatively, if the original peaks in PFA-only were non-specific crosslinking or background noise, and DSG reduces that noise, but that's not typical.\n\nWait, another angle. DSG and PFA crosslinking can affect the sonication efficiency. If adding DSG makes the chromatin more crosslinked, you might get larger DNA fragments after sonication, which can lead to lower resolution or loss of certain regions. But in that case, the peaks shouldn't disappear entirely if proper sonication is done. Maybe the PCR steps are affected? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the disappearing peaks when adding DSG might be regions where IKAROS is not directly binding but is in a complex that's adjacent to DNA. So, when you use PFA alone, the crosslinking between IKAROS and DNA is inefficient or non-existent, so the antibody pulls down DNA that's not directly bound by IKAROS. But maybe in reality, IKAROS is part of a complex that's tethered to DNA through another protein. If you add DSG, which crosslinks the protein complex, the crosslinking to DNA might be more efficient because the entire complex is stabilized. However, in the question, the peaks disappear when DSG is added. That contradicts that idea.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the other way around. If in PFA-only, the actual binding sites are crosslinked and detected, but when you add DSG, the IKAROS protein is crosslinked to other proteins in such a way that the epitope recognized by the antibody is blocked. Therefore, even though the protein is there, the antibody can't bind, leading to loss of signal. So, the disappearing peaks would be the true binding sites because the antibody can't access IKAROS when DSG is used.\n\nBut why would the addition of DSG block the epitope? That would depend on the antibody's target. If the IKAROS antibody's epitope is in a region that's involved in protein-protein interactions, adding DSG might crosslink other proteins to that region, making the epitope inaccessible. However, this would mean that the real peaks disappear, which might indicate that the DSG fixation is inferior for this antibody. But sometimes, DSG is used in combination with PFA to get better crosslinking for certain TFs.\n\nAlternatively, the peaks that disappear are false positives in the PFA-only condition. For example, maybe IKAROS is part of a complex that aggregates or is trapped non-specifically near DNA when only PFA is used. When DSG is added, the crosslinking is more specific or changes the structure so those non-specific interactions are no longer present, leading to loss of the peaks. Therefore, the disappearing peaks are regions where IKAROS isn't actually binding but was artifactually pulled down in PFA-only.\n\nBut how would that work? If DSG fixes protein complexes more effectively, maybe in PFA-only, some transient interactions are captured, but when you crosslink with DSG, those interactions are stabilized, but perhaps not the specific ones. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the use of DSG can improve crosslinking of proteins that aren't effectively crosslinked by PFA alone. For example, some TFs may not be well crosslinked with PFA because they don't directly contact DNA, so using DSG helps to crosslink them to neighboring proteins that are DNA-bound. However, in the scenario of the question, the reverse is happening. So maybe IKAROS is a TF that is directly DNA-bound, and when you use DSG, additional crosslinking occurs that causes the IKAROS-DNA complexes to become insoluble, leading to loss during the sonication or purification steps. But that seems less likely.\n\nWait, I need to think about what the peaks represent. Peaks in ChIP-seq are genomic regions where the protein of interest binds. If using DSG causes the peaks to disappear, where would those peaks be? If they are real binding sites, why would DSG make them disappear? Maybe the factors that mediate the binding of IKAROS to DNA are crosslinked by DSG but not by PFA. For example, IKAROS might be part of a complex where another protein actually binds DNA, and IKAROS is brought in via protein-protein interaction. So in PFA-only, IKAROS isn't crosslinked well to DNA, so the ChIP doesn't work. Wait, but in the question, PFA alone produced peaks. So if that scenario is the case, maybe when they add DSG, they stabilize the interaction between IKAROS and the DNA-binding protein, leading to better crosslinking. But again, opposite of what the question states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when using DSG, the crosslinking is better, but the sonication isn't breaking the DNA properly, leading to larger fragments that do not get sequenced efficiently, thus leading to loss of peaks. But that would affect all peaks, not specific ones. However, the question states that peaks disappear in PFA+DSG. Therefore, the peaks must have been present in PFA-only and missing in PFA+DSG. So the answer is likely about the nature of those peaks: maybe they are indirect binding sites. So the peaks that disappear are in regions where IKAROS is not directly bound to DNA but is instead part of a complex that is near the DNA when only PFA is used. When DSG is added, perhaps those interactions are disrupted or the complex is crosslinked in a way that IKAROS is no longer associated with DNA.\n\nAlternatively, IKAROS might interact with DNA through another protein, and in PFA-only, some leakage occurs where IKAROS is crosslinked, but when you add DSG, the crosslinks to the other protein prevent that interaction from being detected. For example, maybe in the presence of DSG, IKAROS is crosslinked to another protein that either competes with DNA binding or masks the DNA-binding ability. Therefore, IKAROS isn't bound to DNA when DSG is present, hence loss of peaks.\n\nBut why would DSG cause the protein to not bind DNA? That doesn't make sense, because crosslinking should preserve existing interactions, not prevent them. Wait, but DSG is added before the cells are lysed, so the proteins are crosslinked in their native state. If under normal conditions (without DSG), IKAROS is free to bind DNA, but when you fix with DSG, which crosslinks proteins, perhaps the DSG treatment somehow inactivates IKAROS by crosslinking it to other proteins, making it unable to bind DNA? That seems a stretch. Normally, crosslinking is done to preserve interactions as they are. So if the cells are treated with DSG, which is a cell-permeable crosslinker, before adding PFA, perhaps that stabilizes protein complexes before any disruption occurs. Therefore, if IKAROS is part of a complex that does not bind DNA, DSG would fix that complex. But if the original binding was transient or induced by some stress during PFA fixation, then using DSG might prevent artifacts. However, if using DSG leads to the loss of peaks, then the original peaks in PFA might have been artifacts.\n\nWait, the key here is that DSG+PFA fixation is causing the peaks to disappear compared to PFA alone. The user is asking where are such peaks most likely found. If those peaks are the result of indirect binding or non-specific crosslinking in the PFA-only condition, then using DSG (which better preserves protein complexes) might eliminate those false positives by either preventing the non-specific crosslinking or rendering the antibody unable to recognize IKAROS in the context of the crosslinked complex.\n\nSo, if the disappearing peaks are false positives from PFA-only, then they are likely in regions where IKAROS isn't actually binding but was crosslinked non-specifically. Alternatively, they could be regions where the protein is part of a complex that is not stably associated with DNA, and without DSG, some crosslinking occurs, but with DSG, the complex is stabilized but not DNA-associated. Hmm.\n\nI think the most likely answer is that the disappearing peaks are from regions where IKAROS is indirectly associated with DNA, part of a protein complex that is not directly bound to DNA. Therefore, when using DSG, the crosslinking of proteins within the complex masks or alters the accessibility of IKAROS, so those peaks are not detected. Alternatively, maybe with DSG, the true DNA-bound IKAROS is better crosslinked, whereas the indirect ones are not, but the result is disappearance, which is confusing.\n\nWait, another thought: different crosslinking methods can lead to different efficiencies in pulling down DNA. For example, if IKAROS is part of a multiprotein complex where the primary DNA-binding protein is another factor, then in PFA-only, the crosslinking between IKAROS and DNA might be poor. However, if the primary DNA-binding protein is crosslinked by PFA, perhaps IKAROS is crosslinked to that protein via DSG, thereby making the DNA-protein complex more stable. However, why would that disappear?\n\nAlternatively, maybe IKAROS is part of a complex that is tethered to DNA via another protein, and in PFA-only, the crosslinking is insufficient to link IKAROS to DNA. Therefore, when you do ChIP with IKAROS antibody in PFA-only, you get some non-specific binding or crosslinking. But with DSG added, the complex is stabilized, and IKAROS is now crosslinked to the true DNA-binding protein. However, if the sonication shears the DNA such that the DNA bound to the primary protein is pulled down with IKAROS. But this might not result in disappearance; it would result in more specific peaks. \n\nAlternatively, if IKAROS is not directly bound to DNA but is nearby, DSG might crosslink other proteins that interfere with the antibody's ability to bind IKAROS. For example, if the antibody's epitope is blocked by another crosslinked protein, leading to reduced ChIP signal. So the disappearing peaks would be regions where IKAROS is present but not accessible in DSG crosslinking.\n\nIn this scenario, the peaks that disappear are actual IKAROS binding sites, but the DSG fixation prevents the antibody from recognizing IKAROS. However, this would be a technical issue rather than biological. But the question is not about technical problems but the genomic location. So perhaps the answer is that the disappearing peaks are in heterochromatic regions or regions with higher-order chromatin structures that become less accessible with DSG fixation. Wait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, given that IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in B cell development and function, if the peaks lost with DSG are in regions where IKAROS is part of a larger protein complex (like in enhancer regions or promoter regions) and the DSG crosslinking prevents effective immunoprecipitation.\n\nWait, here's a thought: DSG crosslinks proteins, which might lead to more efficient retention of chromatin-bound proteins during the ChIP procedure. However, for proteins that are not directly bound to DNA, DSG could lead to their retention in the insoluble fraction after lysis, preventing their immunoprecipitation. Wait, but that's opposite. If a protein is crosslinked to other proteins but not to DNA, after sonication, the DNA is sheared into fragments. If the protein is crosslinked to other proteins but not to DNA, they would be in the insoluble fraction and discarded. Therefore, in DSG fixation, any proteins not crosslinked to DNA wouldn't be in the soluble chromatin fraction, leading to loss of peaks that are due to non-DNA-bound proteins. Therefore, if the original peaks in PFA only were from IKAROS that's not directly bound to DNA but perhaps aggregated or stuck near DNA, then adding DSG would eliminate those false peaks. Thus, the disappearing peaks are likely in regions where IKAROS is not directly bound to DNA but in the vicinity, such as regions where other proteins are bound and IKAROS is part of the complex indirectly. \n\nSo the answer would be that such disappearing peaks are found in regions where IKAROS is part of a protein complex that is not directly bound to DNA, such as enhancer regions where IKAROS interacts with other transcription factors that are DNA-bound. But I think more specifically, such peaks would be located in regions where the transcription factor is part of a complex that's indirectly associated with DNA through other proteins. Therefore, using DSG crosslinking would prevent these indirect associations from showing up in the ChIP, thereby causing the peaks to disappear. Therefore, the correct answer is that the disappearing peaks are in regions where IKAROS interacts indirectly with DNA through other proteins, such as in protein complexes at promoter or enhancer regions where the DNA is bound by another factor.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744975655, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3686, prompt_tokens=825, total_tokens=4511, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The disappearing ChIP-seq peaks observed when transitioning from PFA-only to PFA+DSG fixation are most likely located in **genomic regions where IKAROS is part of a protein complex that indirectly associates with DNA through other DNA-binding proteins**. 

**Key reasoning:**
1. **Fixation Differences**: 
   - PFA crosslinks proteins to DNA and nearby proteins, which may capture indirect associations (e.g., IKAROS interacting with a DNA-bound partner without direct DNA contact).
   - DSG reinforces protein-protein crosslinks, stabilizing complexes. If IKAROS is not directly DNA-bound but part of a neighboring complex, DSG may prevent its artificial pull-down by "freezing" the complex in a way that masks the epitope or excludes DNA tethering.

2. **Peak Disappearance Mechanism**:
   - In PFA-only, transient or indirect interactions between IKAROS and DNA (via other proteins) may be weakly crosslinked, leading to false-positive peaks.
   - PFA+DSG strengthens crosslinks within protein complexes, potentially occluding the IKAROS epitope or isolating IKAROS in insoluble aggregates, reducing its detection in DNA-associated regions.

3. **Biological Context**:
   - IKAROS often operates in multi-protein complexes (e.g., at enhancers or promoters) where it regulates transcription through interactions with other factors. Peaks lost with DSG likely represent these indirect interactions, while true DNA-bound IKAROS sites (crosslinked effectively by PFA alone) persist.

**Conclusion**: The disappearing peaks are enriched in regions where IKAROS indirectly associates with DNA through protein-protein interactions, such as enhancers or promoters involving co-factors. These sites are artifacts of PFA's limited ability to distinguish direct DNA binding from indirect complex associations.

isscrosses proteins more, perhaps the crosslinking makes the chromatin structure more rigid, making it harder to shear, leading to less efficient pulldown. No, that might affect the whole thing, but perhaps specifically for those regions where the binding was indirect. Alternatively, maybe DSG crosslinking causes IKAROS to be crosslinked to other proteins, so it doesn't get released during sonication, leading to less DNA being pulled down.

Alternatively, if the genuine IKAROS binding sites require DSG to stabilize the interactions, but this question is the opposite: peaks disappear when DSG is added. So in the original case (PFA only), maybe the peaks are non-specific or from cross-reactive antibodies. But why would DSG affect that? Maybe the DSG alters the epitope? Or perhaps the real binding sites are better crosslinked with DSG, but the antibody works better without DSG. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, if the peaks disappear when using DSG, which stabilizes protein-protein interactions, perhaps the peaks in the PFA-only case were due to transient or indirect interactions. So IKAROS might be part of a complex that is near the DNA but not actually binding DNA. PFA crosslinks proteins that are close to DNA, but if the factor is not directly binding DNA, maybe the crosslinking is not as effective. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me backtrack.

In a typical ChIP-seq, factors that directly bind DNA are crosslinked by PFA. Proteins that are part of a complex but not directly DNA-bound may not be crosslinked as effectively. If you add DSG, which crosslinks proteins within a complex, maybe you can pull down proteins that are part of a complex but not DNA-bound. Wait, but how would that affect the DNA association? For example, if IKAROS is part of a multi-protein complex that is associated with DNA via another protein, then using DSG would crosslink the complex, so when you sonicate, the DNA attached to the complex would be co-purified even if IKAROS isn't directly binding DNA. So perhaps in the case of PFA only, the crosslinks are weak for that complex, so IKAROS is not efficiently crosslinked to DNA. But if you add DSG, you stabilize the complex, making the crosslinking more efficient, leading to better ChIP signals. But in the question, the opposite is happening: the peaks disappear when DSG is added.

Alternatively, maybe the reverse is true. The disappearing peaks in PFA+DSG might be because DSG is causing crosslinks that interfere with the antibody's ability to recognize IKAROS. For example, the antibody might recognize an epitope that is occluded when IKAROS is crosslinked to other proteins via DSG. If that's the case, the original peaks in PFA-only might be real binding sites where the antibody could access IKAROS, but when you add DSG, those sites are masked, leading to loss of signal. However, this would suggest that the disappearing peaks are genuine binding sites, but that doesn't seem right because then DSG would be a bad choice, but often DSG is used for better crosslinking. Alternatively, if the original peaks in PFA-only were non-specific crosslinking or background noise, and DSG reduces that noise, but that's not typical.

Wait, another angle. DSG and PFA crosslinking can affect the sonication efficiency. If adding DSG makes the chromatin more crosslinked, you might get larger DNA fragments after sonication, which can lead to lower resolution or loss of certain regions. But in that case, the peaks shouldn't disappear entirely if proper sonication is done. Maybe the PCR steps are affected? Not sure.

Alternatively, the disappearing peaks when adding DSG might be regions where IKAROS is not directly binding but is in a complex that's adjacent to DNA. So, when you use PFA alone, the crosslinking between IKAROS and DNA is inefficient or non-existent, so the antibody pulls down DNA that's not directly bound by IKAROS. But maybe in reality, IKAROS is part of a complex that's tethered to DNA through another protein. If you add DSG, which crosslinks the protein complex, the crosslinking to DNA might be more efficient because the entire complex is stabilized. However, in the question, the peaks disappear when DSG is added. That contradicts that idea.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. If in PFA-only, the actual binding sites are crosslinked and detected, but when you add DSG, the IKAROS protein is crosslinked to other proteins in such a way that the epitope recognized by the antibody is blocked. Therefore, even though the protein is there, the antibody can't bind, leading to loss of signal. So, the disappearing peaks would be the true binding sites because the antibody can't access IKAROS when DSG is used.

But why would the addition of DSG block the epitope? That would depend on the antibody's target. If the IKAROS antibody's epitope is in a region that's involved in protein-protein interactions, adding DSG might crosslink other proteins to that region, making the epitope inaccessible. However, this would mean that the real peaks disappear, which might indicate that the DSG fixation is inferior for this antibody. But sometimes, DSG is used in combination with PFA to get better crosslinking for certain TFs.

Alternatively, the peaks that disappear are false positives in the PFA-only condition. For example, maybe IKAROS is part of a complex that aggregates or is trapped non-specifically near DNA when only PFA is used. When DSG is added, the crosslinking is more specific or changes the structure so those non-specific interactions are no longer present, leading to loss of the peaks. Therefore, the disappearing peaks are regions where IKAROS isn't actually binding but was artifactually pulled down in PFA-only.

But how would that work? If DSG fixes protein complexes more effectively, maybe in PFA-only, some transient interactions are captured, but when you crosslink with DSG, those interactions are stabilized, but perhaps not the specific ones. Hmm, not sure.

Another angle: the use of DSG can improve crosslinking of proteins that aren't effectively crosslinked by PFA alone. For example, some TFs may not be well crosslinked with PFA because they don't directly contact DNA, so using DSG helps to crosslink them to neighboring proteins that are DNA-bound. However, in the scenario of the question, the reverse is happening. So maybe IKAROS is a TF that is directly DNA-bound, and when you use DSG, additional crosslinking occurs that causes the IKAROS-DNA complexes to become insoluble, leading to loss during the sonication or purification steps. But that seems less likely.

Wait, I need to think about what the peaks represent. Peaks in ChIP-seq are genomic regions where the protein of interest binds. If using DSG causes the peaks to disappear, where would those peaks be? If they are real binding sites, why would DSG make them disappear? Maybe the factors that mediate the binding of IKAROS to DNA are crosslinked by DSG but not by PFA. For example, IKAROS might be part of a complex where another protein actually binds DNA, and IKAROS is brought in via protein-protein interaction. So in PFA-only, IKAROS isn't crosslinked well to DNA, so the ChIP doesn't work. Wait, but in the question, PFA alone produced peaks. So if that scenario is the case, maybe when they add DSG, they stabilize the interaction between IKAROS and the DNA-binding protein, leading to better crosslinking. But again, opposite of what the question states.

Alternatively, perhaps when using DSG, the crosslinking is better, but the sonication isn't breaking the DNA properly, leading to larger fragments that do not get sequenced efficiently, thus leading to loss of peaks. But that would affect all peaks, not specific ones. However, the question states that peaks disappear in PFA+DSG. Therefore, the peaks must have been present in PFA-only and missing in PFA+DSG. So the answer is likely about the nature of those peaks: maybe they are indirect binding sites. So the peaks that disappear are in regions where IKAROS is not directly bound to DNA but is instead part of a complex that is near the DNA when only PFA is used. When DSG is added, perhaps those interactions are disrupted or the complex is crosslinked in a way that IKAROS is no longer associated with DNA.

Alternatively, IKAROS might interact with DNA through another protein, and in PFA-only, some leakage occurs where IKAROS is crosslinked, but when you add DSG, the crosslinks to the other protein prevent that interaction from being detected. For example, maybe in the presence of DSG, IKAROS is crosslinked to another protein that either competes with DNA binding or masks the DNA-binding ability. Therefore, IKAROS isn't bound to DNA when DSG is present, hence loss of peaks.

But why would DSG cause the protein to not bind DNA? That doesn't make sense, because crosslinking should preserve existing interactions, not prevent them. Wait, but DSG is added before the cells are lysed, so the proteins are crosslinked in their native state. If under normal conditions (without DSG), IKAROS is free to bind DNA, but when you fix with DSG, which crosslinks proteins, perhaps the DSG treatment somehow inactivates IKAROS by crosslinking it to other proteins, making it unable to bind DNA? That seems a stretch. Normally, crosslinking is done to preserve interactions as they are. So if the cells are treated with DSG, which is a cell-permeable crosslinker, before adding PFA, perhaps that stabilizes protein complexes before any disruption occurs. Therefore, if IKAROS is part of a complex that does not bind DNA, DSG would fix that complex. But if the original binding was transient or induced by some stress during PFA fixation, then using DSG might prevent artifacts. However, if using DSG leads to the loss of peaks, then the original peaks in PFA might have been artifacts.

Wait, the key here is that DSG+PFA fixation is causing the peaks to disappear compared to PFA alone. The user is asking where are such peaks most likely found. If those peaks are the result of indirect binding or non-specific crosslinking in the PFA-only condition, then using DSG (which better preserves protein complexes) might eliminate those false positives by either preventing the non-specific crosslinking or rendering the antibody unable to recognize IKAROS in the context of the crosslinked complex.

So, if the disappearing peaks are false positives from PFA-only, then they are likely in regions where IKAROS isn't actually binding but was crosslinked non-specifically. Alternatively, they could be regions where the protein is part of a complex that is not stably associated with DNA, and without DSG, some crosslinking occurs, but with DSG, the complex is stabilized but not DNA-associated. Hmm.

I think the most likely answer is that the disappearing peaks are from regions where IKAROS is indirectly associated with DNA, part of a protein complex that is not directly bound to DNA. Therefore, when using DSG, the crosslinking of proteins within the complex masks or alters the accessibility of IKAROS, so those peaks are not detected. Alternatively, maybe with DSG, the true DNA-bound IKAROS is better crosslinked, whereas the indirect ones are not, but the result is disappearance, which is confusing.

Wait, another thought: different crosslinking methods can lead to different efficiencies in pulling down DNA. For example, if IKAROS is part of a multiprotein complex where the primary DNA-binding protein is another factor, then in PFA-only, the crosslinking between IKAROS and DNA might be poor. However, if the primary DNA-binding protein is crosslinked by PFA, perhaps IKAROS is crosslinked to that protein via DSG, thereby making the DNA-protein complex more stable. However, why would that disappear?

Alternatively, maybe IKAROS is part of a complex that is tethered to DNA via another protein, and in PFA-only, the crosslinking is insufficient to link IKAROS to DNA. Therefore, when you do ChIP with IKAROS antibody in PFA-only, you get some non-specific binding or crosslinking. But with DSG added, the complex is stabilized, and IKAROS is now crosslinked to the true DNA-binding protein. However, if the sonication shears the DNA such that the DNA bound to the primary protein is pulled down with IKAROS. But this might not result in disappearance; it would result in more specific peaks. 

Alternatively, if IKAROS is not directly bound to DNA but is nearby, DSG might crosslink other proteins that interfere with the antibody's ability to bind IKAROS. For example, if the antibody's epitope is blocked by another crosslinked protein, leading to reduced ChIP signal. So the disappearing peaks would be regions where IKAROS is present but not accessible in DSG crosslinking.

In this scenario, the peaks that disappear are actual IKAROS binding sites, but the DSG fixation prevents the antibody from recognizing IKAROS. However, this would be a technical issue rather than biological. But the question is not about technical problems but the genomic location. So perhaps the answer is that the disappearing peaks are in heterochromatic regions or regions with higher-order chromatin structures that become less accessible with DSG fixation. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, given that IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in B cell development and function, if the peaks lost with DSG are in regions where IKAROS is part of a larger protein complex (like in enhancer regions or promoter regions) and the DSG crosslinking prevents effective immunoprecipitation.

Wait, here's a thought: DSG crosslinks proteins, which might lead to more efficient retention of chromatin-bound proteins during the ChIP procedure. However, for proteins that are not directly bound to DNA, DSG could lead to their retention in the insoluble fraction after lysis, preventing their immunoprecipitation. Wait, but that's opposite. If a protein is crosslinked to other proteins but not to DNA, after sonication, the DNA is sheared into fragments. If the protein is crosslinked to other proteins but not to DNA, they would be in the insoluble fraction and discarded. Therefore, in DSG fixation, any proteins not crosslinked to DNA wouldn't be in the soluble chromatin fraction, leading to loss of peaks that are due to non-DNA-bound proteins. Therefore, if the original peaks in PFA only were from IKAROS that's not directly bound to DNA but perhaps aggregated or stuck near DNA, then adding DSG would eliminate those false peaks. Thus, the disappearing peaks are likely in regions where IKAROS is not directly bound to DNA but in the vicinity, such as regions where other proteins are bound and IKAROS is part of the complex indirectly. 

So the answer would be that such disappearing peaks are found in regions where IKAROS is part of a protein complex that is not directly bound to DNA, such as enhancer regions where IKAROS interacts with other transcription factors that are DNA-bound. But I think more specifically, such peaks would be located in regions where the transcription factor is part of a complex that's indirectly associated with DNA through other proteins. Therefore, using DSG crosslinking would prevent these indirect associations from showing up in the ChIP, thereby causing the peaks to disappear. Therefore, the correct answer is that the disappearing peaks are in regions where IKAROS interacts indirectly with DNA through other proteins, such as in protein complexes at promoter or enhancer regions where the DNA is bound by another factor.

Without DSG, this can lead to **post-lysis artifacts**, where IKAROS non-specifically associates with accessible DNA regions (e.g., open chromatin) after cell disruption.\n   - **DSG**, a protein-protein crosslinker, stabilizes interactions in their native state *before* lysis. This reduces non-specific binding but enhances capture of true DNA-bound complexes by crosslinking IKAROS to its interaction partners.\n\n2. **Disappearing Peaks**:\n   - Peaks in PFA-only experiments may represent **indirect interactions** (e.g., IKAROS tethered to DNA via other proteins in a complex). DSG strengthens these protein complexes, potentially masking IKAROS epitopes or rendering DNA fragments less accessible during sonication/immunoprecipitation.\n   - **Artifactual peaks** from post-lysis binding (PFA-only) are eliminated with DSG, which preserves physiological interactions pre-lysis.\n\n3. **Genomic Context**:\n   - Indirect interactions are often localized to **regulatory elements** (e.g., enhancers, promoters) where IKAROS complexes assemble but do not directly contact DNA. These regions may involve transient or cooperative binding with other transcription factors.\n   - Artifactual peaks in PFA-only data might also occur in **open chromatin regions** (e.g., active promoters), where non-specific post-lysis binding is more likely.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe vanishing peaks are **enriched in genomic regions where IKAROS indirectly associates with DNA through protein complexes**. These sites are likely part of higher-order transcriptional regulatory networks rather than direct DNA-binding motifs. The PFA+DSG protocol better captures true IKAROS-DNA interactions, filtering out noise from indirect or artifactual associations.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=" DSG could stabilize interactions of IKAROS with other proteins, possibly pulling it away from DNA, or making the complex harder to dissolve, leading to loss of signal.\n\nAnother angle: DSG might alter chromatin structure, making certain regions inaccessible. However, the disappearance could also be due to changes in solubility or immunoprecipitation efficiency. Overly strong crosslinking can lead to larger aggregates that aren't efficiently sonicated, leading to lower resolution and fewer peaks.\n\nAlternatively, some crosslinking conditions might mask the antibody epitope. Testing different crosslinkers can affect antibody efficiency. If PFA alone allows better exposure of the IKAROS epitope, DSG might crosslink neighboring proteins that block antibody access. So, disappearing peaks could be sites where IKAROS is in a complex that, when further crosslinked with DSG, becomes inaccessible.\n\nTo summarize the possible reasons:\n\n1. False peaks in PFA-only due to no DSG, masking true interactions when DSG is used. But this seems less likely unless the initial peaks were false positives.\n\n2. DSG causes epitope masking, so genuine IKAROS binding sites aren't pulled down.\n\n3. The peaks seen with PFA alone are indirect interactions where IKAROS wasn't directly DNA-bound; adding DSG disrupts these indirect interactions because of changes in crosslinking, leading the real direct binding to be in different regions. But why would the peaks disappear?\n\nIf IKAROS is binding DNA directly, PFA crosslinks it. Adding DSG is supposed to help. If in PFA-only, crosslinking is inefficient, then maybe only abundant or strongly bound sites show peaks. Adding DSG might improve crosslinking efficiency, but in this case, peaks are disappearing. This is counterintuitive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the original PFA samples, there was more free IKAROS that could bind DNA after extraction, leading to artificial crosslinking (post-lysis artifacts). DSG, by crosslinking proteins before cell lysis, prevents this, leading to the disappearance of non-specific binding.\n\nThis is a significant point: formaldehyde can crosslink post-lysis, leading to artifacts where proteins bind DNA non-specifically during fixation. DSG, a cell-permeable crosslinker, is added to live cells, crosslinking proteins in their native state. If after that, PFA is added, it may fix DNA-protein links. If PFA alone allows post-lysis artifacts, then some peaks in PFA-only samples are artifacts, which disappear when using DSG (since proteins are crosslinked in their native positions before cell lysis). Hence, the disappearing peaks would be artifacts, and the real binding sites would remain.\n\nThus, the disappearing peaks are likely non-specific binding or artifacts from post-lysis crosslinking, fixed by using DSG. Thus, these peaks were not genuine IKAROS binding sites but regions of DNA that became associated with IKAROS after cell lysis when using PFA alone. Therefore, the true peaks would be those that remain in the PFA+DSG condition, while the disappearing ones are artifacts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps DSG stabilizes protein complexes that are washed away during sonication. But that might affect all peaks equally.\n\nConsidering all, the most plausible answer is that the disappearing peaks in PFA+DSG are at heterochromatic regions or regions with high protein density where DSG crosslinking makes the chromatin less accessible, but more likely, the peaks that disappear are non-specific background signals captured by PFA crosslinking post-lysis. Thus, the real peaks that are present only when using proper DSG+PFA were masked by additional peaks in PFA alone that are artefacts. But the question states that the peaks observed with PFA disappear with DSG+PFA. That would suggest that PFA+DSG leads to actual specific binding, but in this case, they used PFA alone and PFA+DSG. If the problem peaks (which disappeared) are from PFA only, then their presence in PFA would be technical artifacts.\n\nAnother angle: DSG is known to improve the detection of certain transcription factors by stabilizing protein complexes. If the peaks from PFA only don't appear in PFA+DSG, maybe those were non-physiological interactions. Alternatively, DSG might block the ability to dissolve certain complexes.\n\nThe key here is understanding that DSG is used to better preserve protein complexes. Therefore, perhaps the disappearance of peaks when using DSG suggests that in PFA alone, there was more noise. The absence in DSG means those peaks were false positives, and the real peaks are found in DSG + PFA. But the question is where would the disappearing peaks (present in PFA-only) be found. The answer would probably relate to the regions where PFA caused non-specific crosslinking, possibly open chromatin regions. Because if DNA is more accessible (e.g., open chromatin), when using PFA alone, proteins may non-specifically stick to DNA during crosslinking. But DSG, by crosslinking protein complexes first, reduces this. Hence, the disappearing peaks may be in open chromatin regions where PFA allows non-specific binding, but DSG prevents that by stabilizing complexes. Therefore, such peaks may be in regions of open chromatin where artifactual binding occurs when cells are lysed and proteins get access to DNA in solution. In the case of DSG, proteins are crosslinked in their native state before lysis, thus avoiding post-lysis artifacts. Hence, the disappearing peaks (artifacts) are more likely in regions that are more accessible or have open chromatin, like promoters or active regulatory elements.\n\nBut transcription factors like IKAROS do bind such regions. Alternatively, if the artifacts are in non-regulatory regions, perhaps repetitive elements or regions with high GC content. Wait, but the alternative is that by having DSG, real peaks are stabilized. So the peaks that disappear with DSG could be in regions where IKAROS isn't really binding. These artifacts might occur in regions where proteins can non-specifically associate with DNA after lysis. Such regions could be nucleosome-depleted or highly accessible. However, promoters are nucleosome-depleted and accessible. Similarly, other regulatory elements.\n\nAlternatively, open chromatin regions could be more prone to such artifacts. Therefore, the disappearing peaks in PFA-only experiments, which are probably artifacts, would be in open chromatin. However, real TF binding sites are often in open chromatin. So this seems contradictory. But maybe it's actually the opposite.\n\nWait, thinking again. Formaldehyde has a short crosslinking time and doesn't penetrate as effectively as DSG. If the PFA-only fixation is insufficient to capture transient interactions or complexes, then in DSG+PFA, you get better crosslinking. But in this case, peaks disappear with DSG, which suggests that they were not real.\n\nAnother possibility is crosslinking reversal: maybe DSG crosslinks are more resistant to reversal during the ChIP protocol steps, leading to less efficient immunoprecipitation. But that seems less likely if the protocol accounts for crosslink reversal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using DSG increases background noise. But the peak calling should account for that by comparison with controls.\n\nA more recent thought—some studies suggest that PFA can crosslink proteins to DNA even when they are not directly bound, if they are in close proximity due to being part of the same complex. DSG may create more crosslinks between proteins, making them heavier and thus get lost in the centrifugation steps, leading to loss of DNA associated with those complexes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe DSG crosslinking creates a larger protein network that doesn't release the DNA during sonication, leading to those regions being underrepresented in sequencing.\n\nIn that case, the disappearing peaks would correspond to regions where the DNA was part of larger protein complexes that couldn't be sheared efficiently when DSG is used.\n\nBut then, where would such DNA regions be? Maybe regions bound by large protein complexes, such as promoters with multiple transcription factors, enhancers, or regions of active transcription.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps regions with tightly packed chromatin, like heterochromatic regions. However, heterochromatin is more condensed and might crosslink more with DSG.\n\nAlternatively, nuclear matrix-associated regions. If DSG crosslinks proteins to the nuclear matrix, DNA near those areas might become harder to shear, leading to loss of those peaks.\n\nHowever, I need to reconcile this with known effects.\n\nActually, I need to recall: DSG is a homobifunctional crosslinker (amine-reactive) that crosslinks proteins within ~12 Å. DSG is often used in ChIP-seq for transcription factors that are not effectively crosslinked by formaldehyde. Combining DSG (which does protein-protein crosslinking) with PFA (protein-DNA) can better capture interactions where the TF is part of a complex not directly binding DNA.\n\nBut then, IKAROS directly interacts with DNA, so perhaps the DSG stabilizes interactions between IKAROS and DNA. So why would the peaks disappear?\n\nBut the answer in the literature suggests that if a ChIP-seq works better with DSG, then the peaks are more genuine. If the peaks are lost upon adding DSG, maybe they are due to indirect crosslinking.\n\nWait, perhaps in the PFA-only case, IKAROS was crosslinked to DNA where it wasn't directly bound but was in a complex with another protein that was bound.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The disappearing peaks observed when switching from PFA-only to PFA+DSG fixation in IKAROS ChIP-seq are **most likely found in genomic regions where IKAROS interacts indirectly with DNA through protein-protein complexes, rather than binding DNA directly**. 

### Key Reasoning:
1. **PFA vs. DSG Effects**:
   - **PFA** primarily crosslinks proteins to DNA and adjacent proteins. Without DSG, this can lead to **post-lysis artifacts**, where IKAROS non-specifically associates with accessible DNA regions (e.g., open chromatin) after cell disruption.
   - **DSG**, a protein-protein crosslinker, stabilizes interactions in their native state *before* lysis. This reduces non-specific binding but enhances capture of true DNA-bound complexes by crosslinking IKAROS to its interaction partners.

2. **Disappearing Peaks**:
   - Peaks in PFA-only experiments may represent **indirect interactions** (e.g., IKAROS tethered to DNA via other proteins in a complex). DSG strengthens these protein complexes, potentially masking IKAROS epitopes or rendering DNA fragments less accessible during sonication/immunoprecipitation.
   - **Artifactual peaks** from post-lysis binding (PFA-only) are eliminated with DSG, which preserves physiological interactions pre-lysis.

3. **Genomic Context**:
   - Indirect interactions are often localized to **regulatory elements** (e.g., enhancers, promoters) where IKAROS complexes assemble but do not directly contact DNA. These regions may involve transient or cooperative binding with other transcription factors.
   - Artifactual peaks in PFA-only data might also occur in **open chromatin regions** (e.g., active promoters), where non-specific post-lysis binding is more likely.

### Conclusion:
The vanishing peaks are **enriched in genomic regions where IKAROS indirectly associates with DNA through protein complexes**. These sites are likely part of higher-order transcriptional regulatory networks rather than direct DNA-binding motifs. The PFA+DSG protocol better captures true IKAROS-DNA interactions, filtering out noise from indirect or artifactual associations.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

DSG could stabilize interactions of IKAROS with other proteins, possibly pulling it away from DNA, or making the complex harder to dissolve, leading to loss of signal.

Another angle: DSG might alter chromatin structure, making certain regions inaccessible. However, the disappearance could also be due to changes in solubility or immunoprecipitation efficiency. Overly strong crosslinking can lead to larger aggregates that aren't efficiently sonicated, leading to lower resolution and fewer peaks.

Alternatively, some crosslinking conditions might mask the antibody epitope. Testing different crosslinkers can affect antibody efficiency. If PFA alone allows better exposure of the IKAROS epitope, DSG might crosslink neighboring proteins that block antibody access. So, disappearing peaks could be sites where IKAROS is in a complex that, when further crosslinked with DSG, becomes inaccessible.

To summarize the possible reasons:

1. False peaks in PFA-only due to no DSG, masking true interactions when DSG is used. But this seems less likely unless the initial peaks were false positives.

2. DSG causes epitope masking, so genuine IKAROS binding sites aren't pulled down.

3. The peaks seen with PFA alone are indirect interactions where IKAROS wasn't directly DNA-bound; adding DSG disrupts these indirect interactions because of changes in crosslinking, leading the real direct binding to be in different regions. But why would the peaks disappear?

If IKAROS is binding DNA directly, PFA crosslinks it. Adding DSG is supposed to help. If in PFA-only, crosslinking is inefficient, then maybe only abundant or strongly bound sites show peaks. Adding DSG might improve crosslinking efficiency, but in this case, peaks are disappearing. This is counterintuitive.

Alternatively, maybe in the original PFA samples, there was more free IKAROS that could bind DNA after extraction, leading to artificial crosslinking (post-lysis artifacts). DSG, by crosslinking proteins before cell lysis, prevents this, leading to the disappearance of non-specific binding.

This is a significant point: formaldehyde can crosslink post-lysis, leading to artifacts where proteins bind DNA non-specifically during fixation. DSG, a cell-permeable crosslinker, is added to live cells, crosslinking proteins in their native state. If after that, PFA is added, it may fix DNA-protein links. If PFA alone allows post-lysis artifacts, then some peaks in PFA-only samples are artifacts, which disappear when using DSG (since proteins are crosslinked in their native positions before cell lysis). Hence, the disappearing peaks would be artifacts, and the real binding sites would remain.

Thus, the disappearing peaks are likely non-specific binding or artifacts from post-lysis crosslinking, fixed by using DSG. Thus, these peaks were not genuine IKAROS binding sites but regions of DNA that became associated with IKAROS after cell lysis when using PFA alone. Therefore, the true peaks would be those that remain in the PFA+DSG condition, while the disappearing ones are artifacts.

Alternatively, perhaps DSG stabilizes protein complexes that are washed away during sonication. But that might affect all peaks equally.

Considering all, the most plausible answer is that the disappearing peaks in PFA+DSG are at heterochromatic regions or regions with high protein density where DSG crosslinking makes the chromatin less accessible, but more likely, the peaks that disappear are non-specific background signals captured by PFA crosslinking post-lysis. Thus, the real peaks that are present only when using proper DSG+PFA were masked by additional peaks in PFA alone that are artefacts. But the question states that the peaks observed with PFA disappear with DSG+PFA. That would suggest that PFA+DSG leads to actual specific binding, but in this case, they used PFA alone and PFA+DSG. If the problem peaks (which disappeared) are from PFA only, then their presence in PFA would be technical artifacts.

Another angle: DSG is known to improve the detection of certain transcription factors by stabilizing protein complexes. If the peaks from PFA only don't appear in PFA+DSG, maybe those were non-physiological interactions. Alternatively, DSG might block the ability to dissolve certain complexes.

The key here is understanding that DSG is used to better preserve protein complexes. Therefore, perhaps the disappearance of peaks when using DSG suggests that in PFA alone, there was more noise. The absence in DSG means those peaks were false positives, and the real peaks are found in DSG + PFA. But the question is where would the disappearing peaks (present in PFA-only) be found. The answer would probably relate to the regions where PFA caused non-specific crosslinking, possibly open chromatin regions. Because if DNA is more accessible (e.g., open chromatin), when using PFA alone, proteins may non-specifically stick to DNA during crosslinking. But DSG, by crosslinking protein complexes first, reduces this. Hence, the disappearing peaks may be in open chromatin regions where PFA allows non-specific binding, but DSG prevents that by stabilizing complexes. Therefore, such peaks may be in regions of open chromatin where artifactual binding occurs when cells are lysed and proteins get access to DNA in solution. In the case of DSG, proteins are crosslinked in their native state before lysis, thus avoiding post-lysis artifacts. Hence, the disappearing peaks (artifacts) are more likely in regions that are more accessible or have open chromatin, like promoters or active regulatory elements.

But transcription factors like IKAROS do bind such regions. Alternatively, if the artifacts are in non-regulatory regions, perhaps repetitive elements or regions with high GC content. Wait, but the alternative is that by having DSG, real peaks are stabilized. So the peaks that disappear with DSG could be in regions where IKAROS isn't really binding. These artifacts might occur in regions where proteins can non-specifically associate with DNA after lysis. Such regions could be nucleosome-depleted or highly accessible. However, promoters are nucleosome-depleted and accessible. Similarly, other regulatory elements.

Alternatively, open chromatin regions could be more prone to such artifacts. Therefore, the disappearing peaks in PFA-only experiments, which are probably artifacts, would be in open chromatin. However, real TF binding sites are often in open chromatin. So this seems contradictory. But maybe it's actually the opposite.

Wait, thinking again. Formaldehyde has a short crosslinking time and doesn't penetrate as effectively as DSG. If the PFA-only fixation is insufficient to capture transient interactions or complexes, then in DSG+PFA, you get better crosslinking. But in this case, peaks disappear with DSG, which suggests that they were not real.

Another possibility is crosslinking reversal: maybe DSG crosslinks are more resistant to reversal during the ChIP protocol steps, leading to less efficient immunoprecipitation. But that seems less likely if the protocol accounts for crosslink reversal.

Alternatively, maybe using DSG increases background noise. But the peak calling should account for that by comparison with controls.

A more recent thought—some studies suggest that PFA can crosslink proteins to DNA even when they are not directly bound, if they are in close proximity due to being part of the same complex. DSG may create more crosslinks between proteins, making them heavier and thus get lost in the centrifugation steps, leading to loss of DNA associated with those complexes.

Alternatively, maybe DSG crosslinking creates a larger protein network that doesn't release the DNA during sonication, leading to those regions being underrepresented in sequencing.

In that case, the disappearing peaks would correspond to regions where the DNA was part of larger protein complexes that couldn't be sheared efficiently when DSG is used.

But then, where would such DNA regions be? Maybe regions bound by large protein complexes, such as promoters with multiple transcription factors, enhancers, or regions of active transcription.

Alternatively, perhaps regions with tightly packed chromatin, like heterochromatic regions. However, heterochromatin is more condensed and might crosslink more with DSG.

Alternatively, nuclear matrix-associated regions. If DSG crosslinks proteins to the nuclear matrix, DNA near those areas might become harder to shear, leading to loss of those peaks.

However, I need to reconcile this with known effects.

Actually, I need to recall: DSG is a homobifunctional crosslinker (amine-reactive) that crosslinks proteins within ~12 Å. DSG is often used in ChIP-seq for transcription factors that are not effectively crosslinked by formaldehyde. Combining DSG (which does protein-protein crosslinking) with PFA (protein-DNA) can better capture interactions where the TF is part of a complex not directly binding DNA.

But then, IKAROS directly interacts with DNA, so perhaps the DSG stabilizes interactions between IKAROS and DNA. So why would the peaks disappear?

But the answer in the literature suggests that if a ChIP-seq works better with DSG, then the peaks are more genuine. If the peaks are lost upon adding DSG, maybe they are due to indirect crosslinking.

Wait, perhaps in the PFA-only case, IKAROS was crosslinked to DNA where it wasn't directly bound but was in a complex with another protein that was bound. Adding DSG crosslinked those complexes in a way that the DNA binding protein in the complex wasn't as accessible for co-precipitation, leading to loss of peaks.

Alternatively, in PFA-only, there's inefficient crosslinking so the antibody pulls down regions with high local concentrations of IKAROS (but not directly bound), while in PFA+DSG, crosslinking stabilizes actual DNA-bound IKAROS, but maybe there's an epitope issue.

But the expected answer might relate to the genomic regions. For example, disappearing peaks are from heterochromatin or regions where crosslinking without DSG allows crosslinking of freely moving TFs, but when DSG is added, better crosslinking captures real binding sites elsewhere. But no, the hypothesis is that the disappearing peaks are artifacts found in ...

Alternatively, these peaks might be located in regions with weaker binding sites. Because DSG might stabilize interactions at stronger binding sites and the weaker ones are lost in the noise.

But the prompt states that the peaks that exist in PFA disappear when DSG is used. Considering that DSG can enhance ChIP efficiency for some TFs by stabilizing interactions, the loss might imply that those peaks were not real. So if IKAROS is typically found at promoter regions of certain genes (B cell related), perhaps the fake peaks are in regions like enhancers or other areas where IKAROS doesn't usually bind. But this is too speculative.

Another angle: if DSG prevents epitope recognition, maybe the disappearing peaks are regions where the antibody cross-reacts with other proteins that are adjacent when using PFA only. But in DSG+PFA, those cross-reactivities are prevented because the proteins are crosslinked in a way that the epitope is hidden.

Alternatively, using DSG could decrease sonication efficiency for certain regions, but this would affect coverage.

After considering, the most plausible explanation is that the peaks that disappear are artifacts caused by crosslinking after cell lysis (post-lysis artifacts) in the PFA-only protocol, leading to non-specific binding. These artifacts are prevented when using DSG+PFA, which crosslinks proteins in their native state before lysis.

Therefore, disappearing peaks are locations where IKAROS interacts indirectly with DNA through other proteins.

Wait, but peaks disappear with DSG. So, likely that actual direct binding sites would be retained, unless fixation interferes. Alternatively, when using PFA only, some indirect associations might be crosslinked where the proximity allows DNA-protein crosslink via PFA even if IKAROS is part of a nearby complex. DSG stabilizes the protein-protein interactions, pulling IKAROS away from the DNA, leading to less free DNA proximate crosslinks. Thus, DSG might lead to loss of false-positive peaks that were actually due to transient or indirect interactions.\n\nTherefore, the peaks that disappear with PFA+DSG likely occur in regions where IKAROS isn\'t directly binding DNA but is part of a multiprotein complex near the DNA. The more efficient crosslinking with DSG might tether IKAROS to other proteins instead, so during sonication, the DNA breaks, and the protein complex doesn\'t immunoprecipitate with the DNA. Conversely, if the antibody requires the free epitope (not crosslinked by DSG), then DSG used in combination may crosslink IKAROS to other proteins, making the epitope inaccessible, leading to missing peaks. So DSG-mediated crosslinking may make the epitope inaccessible, meaning that the original PFA peaks might be genuine, but DSG causes loss. However, that would indicate an antibody issue rather than the location of the peaks.\n\nThe question is not about antibody efficiency but the location. So perhaps because DSG causes alterations in fixation leading to loss of real peaks, but the premise states the standard procedures were followed, including alignment and peak-calling. But the question seems to be about region types where peaks that disappear would be. If DSG is better for crosslinking, then when using DSG, they think about the fact that DSG improves ChIP for some factors but perhaps impairs others. For example, where the target is part of a multiprotein complex that might not crosslink efficiently unless DSG is present. Wait, here it\'s the reverse: DSG causes the peaks to disappear. So perhaps the proteins that are distant from DNA, or in regions where DNA is in a conformation that PFA alone doesn\'t crosslink properly, then DSG might obscure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in regions of open chromatin. Open chromatin allows PFA to penetrate and crosslink transient interactions, but DSG over-crosslinking makes chromatin more insoluble and harder to shear, leading to loss of peaks. But peak-calling is the same process. Alternatively, maybe the IKAROS transcription factor is present in regions where proteins are arranged in a way that DSG disrupts. This isn\'t straightforward.\n\nAnother angle: considering the types of binding. If the original peaks (PFA only) are indirect, perhaps binding through another protein. For example, if IKAROS is part of a complex that interacts with DNA via another protein. In PFA-only, the crosslinking may be inadequate to stabilize that complex, so only the direct DNA-bound factors are pulled down. Wait, but using DSG (which enhances protein-protein crosslinks) would help pull down complexes, right? But here when using DSG, the peaks disappear, so that contradicts. Let me think. If in PFA only condition, IKAROS is close to DNA but not directly bound (indirect), but crosslinking to DNA via another protein. If DSG is added, maybe the other protein\'s interactions are stabilized with DNA (with DSG and PFA), but perhaps the IKAROS component is not efficiently crosslinked to other proteins if DSG isn\'t present. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, DSG might create such extensive crosslinking that during sonication (fragmentation), the DNA is not sheared properly, leading to larger fragments not optimally processed, leading to loss of peaks. But this would impact all regions similarly, so maybe some regions are more susceptible. Alternatively, maybe the IKAROS binding sites are in regions with higher protein density. Extreme crosslinking could make extraction and fragmentation difficult. But the scenario is that the peaks disappeared probably because they are not truly DNA-binding sites. Meanwhile, when using better crosslinking (DSG + PFA), proteins that are part of complexes not directly bound to DNA may be crosslinked to the complex\'s DNA and lead to false peaks. But in this case, adding DSG causes peaks to disappear. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. Normally, DSG is used in combination with PFA for transcription factors that are difficult to crosslink, particularly those that are not directly bound to DNA. For example, some factors interact indirectly through other DNA-bound proteins. In such cases, PFA only might not crosslink the factor to DNA (since no direct DNA binding), but with DSG, you crosslink the protein to the DNA-bound protein, thereby pulling down DNA when you immunoprecipitate the factor. Therefore, with DSG, you\'d get more peaks. Here, the reverse is happening, so if peaks disappear when using DSG, perhaps the peaks in PFA-only are not true. The DSG fixation might reveal that those regions are not true binding sites. But why? Because in DSG, you might actually capture the true interactions. If peaks disappear, that suggests that in DSG, either the crosslinking is not happening (unlikely) or the antibody fails to recognize the target. But given that DSG causes the disappearance, perhaps the antibody is less effective when DSG is present.\n\nCrosslinking can mask epitopes. If DSG stabilizes a conformation that hides the antibody\'s epitope on IKAROS, then you get less immunoprecipitation, leading to loss of peaks. Alternatively, matrix effects (more crosslinked proteins leading to lower access for antibodies). But the question is where such peaks would be found. If the peaks that disappear when using DSG are from regions where IKAROS wasn\'t really bound, but with PFA alone, there\'s some crosslinking artifact. However, if PFA captures direct DNA-bound regions, while DSG addresses indirect... Hmm.\n\nTo summarize, there are two possibilities: the disappearing peaks either are indirect binding sites (where IKAROS is part of a complex not directly touching DNA) and DSG stabilizes its crosslinking away from DNA, or the DSG fixation impairs antibody access, so the peaks that disappear are all of the real sites, but that\'s less likely (since standard practice uses DSG+PFA for some TFs).\n\nAnother angle: DSG may fix the nuclear matrix or other structures such that DNA is more crosslinked to structural regions, leading to more background noise. But again, the peak calling is standardized.\n\nThe key is probably the ability of DSG to crosslink protein complexes. If the peaks detected under PFA are from IKAROS being directly DNA-bound, but when DSG is added, the crosslinking might pull multiple DNA strands together through protein complexes, causing the DNA to stick together and not shear properly, making those regions impossible to sequence? But peak calling steps tried to handle that. Maybe that\'s not. Instead, peaks that disappear when adding DSG are likely regions where the signal was artificial in the PFA-only case. For example, if in PFA-only, weak crosslinks allow the antibody to pull down DNA regions adjacent to the actual IKAROS sites (like in open chromatin), but when DSG is added and crosslinking is stronger, the real IKAROS-bound DNA is pulled down properly but the false open chromatin adjacent regions aren\'t. But that brings us back: disappearing peaks when DSG is added would be false positives in PFA only. Therefore, the answer is that the disappearing peaks are in regions of open chromatin where indirect associations or non-specific binding occurs, whereas true IKAROS binding sites are preserved with DSG. But in the scenario, the user says the peaks disappear with DSG. So if using better fixation, but the peaks disappear, then the real ChIP may require DSG. Wait, there is an inconsistency here. Normally, if DSG improves crosslinking, you might get more or better peaks. But here, with DSG, the peaks disappear, meaning perhaps that the initial peaks (PFA) were from non-specific or non-direct binding. Thus, the disappearing peaks would be false, in open chromatin regions where proteins are loosely associated, so that adding DSG either stabilizes the actual interactions (so the true sites are caught but also others?), but maybe in this case, the standard peak calling detects more noise in PFA. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, open chromatin regions are more accessible to PFA crosslinking, leading to crosslinking of proteins even if they are not directly bound, because the chromatin is open. When using DSG, these proteins might be crosslinked further into a network, reducing the ability to shear the chromatin into the appropriate fragment sizes. Alternatively, if they use DSG, the number of crosslinks in open chromatin regions might lead to crosslinking to other structures, making DNA less soluble, leading to loss during immunoprecipitation. Hence, the peaks lost with DSG correspond to open chromatin regions (which are more subject to crosslinking artifacts in PFA-only) and do not represent true IKAROS binding sites. That makes sense. True IKAROS sites would be in regions where they are stably bound and crosslinked effectively with DSG. But in PFA-only, the crosslinking in open chromatin allows non-specific deposits. Wait, maybe when combining DSG with PFA, it reduces non-specific background, so the disappearing peaks are the non-specific ones. Alternatively, true IKAROS sites require both crosslinkers. But that contradicts the scenario where peaks disappear with DSG. So confusing.\n\nAnother point: Some TFs require DSG to be crosslinked properly. If IKAROS is one of them, then using PFA only may not effectively crosslink them. However, in the question, when using PFA only, they find peaks (which would paradoxically be weaker if crosslinking is bad, unless there is more background). Alternatively, DSG may inhibit the effect. Wait, the problem states that the peaks produced with PFA disappear when using DSG+PFA. So with both crosslinkers, the result is loss of peaks.\n\nIf the antibody is against IKAROS, a transcription factor, which is directly binding DNA, then enhanced crosslinking (DSG+PFA) should better preserve the TF-DNA interactions. But if PFA alone gives peaks, and adding DSG loses peaks, perhaps because the additional crosslinking traps the TF-DNA complexes in such a way that they are not accessible to the antibody. If DSG crosslinks IKAROS to other proteins that mask the epitope, the antibody can\'t bind. Therefore, the true binding sites don\'t get detected in DSG+PFA, leading to loss of peaks.\n\nAlternatively, if the actual binding sites are mediated by a protein complex, but when you crosslink with DSG, the IKAROS epitope is somehow obscured.\n\nAlternatively, the ChIP efficiency is diminished due to over-crosslinking, leading to loss of all peaks, but the question says only some peaks disappear, implying other peaks would remain. But the user says "peaks disappeared" in general when DSG was used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main issue is in the fixation-induced epitope masking. With antibodies used in ChIP, the crosslinking can impair recognition. DSG might crosslink regions of IKAROS needed for the antibody\'s epitope. Therefore, in cases where epitope is critical, DSG would reduce IP efficiency, eliminating genuine peaks but in reality the peaks would still be present—they’re just not detected. So those peaks (the ones in the PFA scenario) are genuine but are masked when DSG is added.\n\nBut where would such peaks be located? Probably actual IKAROS binding sites. The question says the peaks "disappeared when PFA+DSG." But the answer needs to relate to genomic regions where these peaks are found. If DSG causes epitope masking, then the true binding sites (like promoter regions, enhancers) would disappear as DSG is added, suggesting that somehow the answer is the true binding sites. But this contradicts standard practices where DSG is beneficial, not deleterious.\n\nAlternatively, when DSG is added, it leads to better retention of true sites and the disappearance of non-specific or indirect binding. Therefore, peaks that disappear upon DSG addition would not be true sites. But if the true sites are those captured better with DSG, then the opposite.\n\nBut here in the question, the peaks only appear when using PFA (no DSG). Therefore, the disappearing peaks would be those that are false positives. The answer likely is that the disappearing peaks (present in PFA only) are located in regions of open chromatin where non-specific binding occurs. This is because in PFA conditions, open chromatin allows more crosslinking, leading to false peaks that are not present when DSG is added (possibly more specific crosslinking reduces this). But why would DSG reduce open chromatin artifacts?\n\nAlternatively, regions that are heterochromatic or in a denser nuclear environment may not crosslink well with PFA alone but with DSG. Therefore, the peaks disappearing when using DSG+PFA are actually in open chromatin, as DSG would not be necessary there. But I\'m getting stuck.\n\nWait, another possible explanation: ChIP-seq artifacts in PFA might not survive DSG fixation. Crosslinking can sometimes capture DNA-associated proteins transiently or loosely bound. If DSG+PFA fix cells more stringently, such transient interactions are not preserved (they might be washed away) because they are not crosslinked. But this seems contradictory. Normally, stronger fixation (DSG+PFA) might retain more interactions, increasing the number of peaks. But perhaps specifically, such combined fixation makes DNA-protein crosslinks too bulky, leading to poor sonication efficiency. If regions with low TF binding (e.g., open chromatin) are more sensitive to different fixation methods, leading to DNA that is not properly fragmented. Wait. Alternatively, the combination of DSG and PFA might improve crosslinking in protein complexes not directly bound to DNA but assist in ChIP of such cases. The presence of peaks with PFA and loss with DSG would suggest an inverse.\n\nAlternatively, think about when using PFA, DNA-protein crosslinks are direct. DSG adds protein-protein crosslinks. If a protein is part of a complex but doesn\'t directly bind DNA, PFA might not crosslink it to DNA, but DSG would presumably crosslink it to a DNA-binding protein. However, this would lead to detection of the complex in the presence of DSG. But in this scenario, using DSG makes the peaks disappear, which in such a case might mean that the initial peaks in PFA directly attach IKAROS to DNA. If adding DSG somehow crosslinks IKAROS to other proteins, the DNA might be sheared away, getting no signal. For example, if IKAROS is connected via DSG to a nuclear matrix protein, then during sonication, the DNA fragments might be pulled into the pellet with matrix proteins, so they aren\'t in the supernatant for IP. Thus, the DNA regions around IKAROS (if crosslinked to non-DNA structures) might become insoluble.\n\nAlternatively, the use of DSG may have altered epitope availability or caused crosslinking that makes the antibody bind less efficiently. If the peaks disappear because of that irrespective of genomic location, the answer might not be region-specific, which contradicts the question. Therefore, the genomic location is functional: indirect binding regions.\n\nGiven that IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in B cell development and binds directly to DNA, the disappearing peaks might be indicative of indirect binding through other proteins. So in PFA-only, some of the crosslinking captures IKAROS in proximity to DNA through interactions with other DNA-bound proteins, thus appearing as peaks. However, with DSG added, the protein-protein crosslinking stabilizes those interactions, but DNA fragmentation may separate the DNA fragments that were originally co-purifying with IKAROS. But in ChIP, fragment sizes are sheared around the crosslinking points, so if IKAROS is crosslinked via another protein to DNA, then the DNA region adjacent to that protein might co-purify. If DSG holds proteins together but in a way that during sonication, the DNA breaks between regions crosslinked to the protein complex. Hmm, this is complex.\n\nAlternatively, suppose IKAROS is part of a larger protein complex that is not directly bound to DNA. Using PFA alone, perhaps there\'s accidental crosslinking to nearby DNA regions, creating false peaks. DSG better crosslinks the complex, holding it together but not crosslinked to DNA, which then leads to no DNA fragments immunoprecipitating. Therefore, decreasing those false-positive peaks. Such false peaks would be more likely to occur near regions where such complexes are located, which might be near genes that are regulated by such complexes. But more specifically, in regions like enhancers or promoters, maybe, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering chromatin configuration: regions where DNA is in a more open state (like regulatory elements such as promoters or enhancers) with surrounding proteins might be prone to more crosslinking in PFA-only, creating artifactual signals. Adding DSG crosslinks proteins more securely but not the DNA-protein link, leading to loss of such peaks. However, actual IKAROS binding sites would be crosslinked in PFA and in PFA+DSG. So perhaps the disappearing peaks are not at true binding sites but at regions of open chromatin. Therefore, the correct answer would be that the disappearing peaks are in open chromatin regions where non-specific or indirect binding occurs. True binding sites (like promoters of IKAROS target genes) would persist. However, since with DSG they disappear, which would conflict unless the real binding sites require DSG for detection. But in the example here, DSG abolishes the peaks. Therefore, substitute, the peaks observed in PFA only are representing regions where the actual TF was not bound but crosslinked artifactually. Since the true binding would persist even with DSG.\n\nAlternatively, if PFA does not effectively crosslink IKAROS to DNA, but using an antibody with a high background detects noise in PFA (while DSG reduces noise via enhancing specific crosslinks), then the peaks that disappear with addition of DSG would be in regions of open chromatin. Concluding that the disappearing peaks are likely found in open chromatin regions where non-specific crosslinking occurs with PFA fixation alone, and DSG suppresses such artifacts, suggesting the original peaks were false positives.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

The disappearing peaks observed when switching from PFA-only to PFA+DSG fixation in the ChIP-seq experiment for IKAROS in human B cells are most likely located in **open chromatin regions** or areas of **indirect DNA association**. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Crosslinking Dynamics**:
   - **PFA** primarily crosslinks proteins directly bound to DNA. However, in open chromatin regions, transient or loose interactions between proteins (like IKAROS in multiprotein complexes) near DNA might be non-specifically captured due to accessibility, generating false-positive peaks.
   - **DSG** strengthens protein-protein crosslinking, stabilizing complexes but potentially distancing DNA from IKAROS if it is not directly bound. This reduces indirect crosslinking artifacts but may mask epitopes or pull IKAROS into insoluble aggregates during sonication, leading to loss of artifactual peaks.

2. **Mechanism of Disappearance**:
   - Peaks detected with PFA alone might represent **indirect associations**, where IKAROS is part of a complex near DNA but not directly bound. DSG stabilizes the complex, causing IKAROS to immunoprecipitate with proteins rather than DNA during fragmentation.
   - Alternatively, **epitope masking** by DSG could prevent antibody binding, but this issue would affect all peaks indiscriminately, not just specific regions.

3. **Genomic Context**:
   - **Open chromatin regions** are prone to nonspecific crosslinking in PFA-only conditions due to accessibility. Adding DSG reduces this noise by improving specificity, leading to the disappearance of false peaks.
   - True IKAROS binding sites (e.g., promoters or enhancers of target genes) would typically persist with PFA+DSG fixation unless epitope masking occurs, suggesting the lost peaks are artifacts.

**Answer**: The disappearing peaks are most likely artifacts located in **open chromatin regions**, where PFA fixation alone captures transient or indirect associations that DSG crosslinking suppresses. These peaks do not represent direct IKAROS-DNA interactions.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Therefore, DSG fixated samples expose the true binding sites missing in PFA+DSG. Wait, but peaks disappear with DSG. So, likely that actual direct binding sites would be retained, unless fixation interferes. Alternatively, when using PFA only, some indirect associations might be crosslinked where the proximity allows DNA-protein crosslink via PFA even if IKAROS is part of a nearby complex. DSG stabilizes the protein-protein interactions, pulling IKAROS away from the DNA, leading to less free DNA proximate crosslinks. Thus, DSG might lead to loss of false-positive peaks that were actually due to transient or indirect interactions.

Therefore, the peaks that disappear with PFA+DSG likely occur in regions where IKAROS isn't directly binding DNA but is part of a multiprotein complex near the DNA. The more efficient crosslinking with DSG might tether IKAROS to other proteins instead, so during sonication, the DNA breaks, and the protein complex doesn't immunoprecipitate with the DNA. Conversely, if the antibody requires the free epitope (not crosslinked by DSG), then DSG used in combination may crosslink IKAROS to other proteins, making the epitope inaccessible, leading to missing peaks. So DSG-mediated crosslinking may make the epitope inaccessible, meaning that the original PFA peaks might be genuine, but DSG causes loss. However, that would indicate an antibody issue rather than the location of the peaks.

The question is not about antibody efficiency but the location. So perhaps because DSG causes alterations in fixation leading to loss of real peaks, but the premise states the standard procedures were followed, including alignment and peak-calling. But the question seems to be about region types where peaks that disappear would be. If DSG is better for crosslinking, then when using DSG, they think about the fact that DSG improves ChIP for some factors but perhaps impairs others. For example, where the target is part of a multiprotein complex that might not crosslink efficiently unless DSG is present. Wait, here it's the reverse: DSG causes the peaks to disappear. So perhaps the proteins that are distant from DNA, or in regions where DNA is in a conformation that PFA alone doesn't crosslink properly, then DSG might obscure.

Alternatively, perhaps in regions of open chromatin. Open chromatin allows PFA to penetrate and crosslink transient interactions, but DSG over-crosslinking makes chromatin more insoluble and harder to shear, leading to loss of peaks. But peak-calling is the same process. Alternatively, maybe the IKAROS transcription factor is present in regions where proteins are arranged in a way that DSG disrupts. This isn't straightforward.

Another angle: considering the types of binding. If the original peaks (PFA only) are indirect, perhaps binding through another protein. For example, if IKAROS is part of a complex that interacts with DNA via another protein. In PFA-only, the crosslinking may be inadequate to stabilize that complex, so only the direct DNA-bound factors are pulled down. Wait, but using DSG (which enhances protein-protein crosslinks) would help pull down complexes, right? But here when using DSG, the peaks disappear, so that contradicts. Let me think. If in PFA only condition, IKAROS is close to DNA but not directly bound (indirect), but crosslinking to DNA via another protein. If DSG is added, maybe the other protein's interactions are stabilized with DNA (with DSG and PFA), but perhaps the IKAROS component is not efficiently crosslinked to other proteins if DSG isn't present. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, DSG might create such extensive crosslinking that during sonication (fragmentation), the DNA is not sheared properly, leading to larger fragments not optimally processed, leading to loss of peaks. But this would impact all regions similarly, so maybe some regions are more susceptible. Alternatively, maybe the IKAROS binding sites are in regions with higher protein density. Extreme crosslinking could make extraction and fragmentation difficult. But the scenario is that the peaks disappeared probably because they are not truly DNA-binding sites. Meanwhile, when using better crosslinking (DSG + PFA), proteins that are part of complexes not directly bound to DNA may be crosslinked to the complex's DNA and lead to false peaks. But in this case, adding DSG causes peaks to disappear. Hmm.

Wait, no. Normally, DSG is used in combination with PFA for transcription factors that are difficult to crosslink, particularly those that are not directly bound to DNA. For example, some factors interact indirectly through other DNA-bound proteins. In such cases, PFA only might not crosslink the factor to DNA (since no direct DNA binding), but with DSG, you crosslink the protein to the DNA-bound protein, thereby pulling down DNA when you immunoprecipitate the factor. Therefore, with DSG, you'd get more peaks. Here, the reverse is happening, so if peaks disappear when using DSG, perhaps the peaks in PFA-only are not true. The DSG fixation might reveal that those regions are not true binding sites. But why? Because in DSG, you might actually capture the true interactions. If peaks disappear, that suggests that in DSG, either the crosslinking is not happening (unlikely) or the antibody fails to recognize the target. But given that DSG causes the disappearance, perhaps the antibody is less effective when DSG is present.

Crosslinking can mask epitopes. If DSG stabilizes a conformation that hides the antibody's epitope on IKAROS, then you get less immunoprecipitation, leading to loss of peaks. Alternatively, matrix effects (more crosslinked proteins leading to lower access for antibodies). But the question is where such peaks would be found. If the peaks that disappear when using DSG are from regions where IKAROS wasn't really bound, but with PFA alone, there's some crosslinking artifact. However, if PFA captures direct DNA-bound regions, while DSG addresses indirect... Hmm.

To summarize, there are two possibilities: the disappearing peaks either are indirect binding sites (where IKAROS is part of a complex not directly touching DNA) and DSG stabilizes its crosslinking away from DNA, or the DSG fixation impairs antibody access, so the peaks that disappear are all of the real sites, but that's less likely (since standard practice uses DSG+PFA for some TFs).

Another angle: DSG may fix the nuclear matrix or other structures such that DNA is more crosslinked to structural regions, leading to more background noise. But again, the peak calling is standardized.

The key is probably the ability of DSG to crosslink protein complexes. If the peaks detected under PFA are from IKAROS being directly DNA-bound, but when DSG is added, the crosslinking might pull multiple DNA strands together through protein complexes, causing the DNA to stick together and not shear properly, making those regions impossible to sequence? But peak calling steps tried to handle that. Maybe that's not. Instead, peaks that disappear when adding DSG are likely regions where the signal was artificial in the PFA-only case. For example, if in PFA-only, weak crosslinks allow the antibody to pull down DNA regions adjacent to the actual IKAROS sites (like in open chromatin), but when DSG is added and crosslinking is stronger, the real IKAROS-bound DNA is pulled down properly but the false open chromatin adjacent regions aren't. But that brings us back: disappearing peaks when DSG is added would be false positives in PFA only. Therefore, the answer is that the disappearing peaks are in regions of open chromatin where indirect associations or non-specific binding occurs, whereas true IKAROS binding sites are preserved with DSG. But in the scenario, the user says the peaks disappear with DSG. So if using better fixation, but the peaks disappear, then the real ChIP may require DSG. Wait, there is an inconsistency here. Normally, if DSG improves crosslinking, you might get more or better peaks. But here, with DSG, the peaks disappear, meaning perhaps that the initial peaks (PFA) were from non-specific or non-direct binding. Thus, the disappearing peaks would be false, in open chromatin regions where proteins are loosely associated, so that adding DSG either stabilizes the actual interactions (so the true sites are caught but also others?), but maybe in this case, the standard peak calling detects more noise in PFA. Hmm.

Alternatively, open chromatin regions are more accessible to PFA crosslinking, leading to crosslinking of proteins even if they are not directly bound, because the chromatin is open. When using DSG, these proteins might be crosslinked further into a network, reducing the ability to shear the chromatin into the appropriate fragment sizes. Alternatively, if they use DSG, the number of crosslinks in open chromatin regions might lead to crosslinking to other structures, making DNA less soluble, leading to loss during immunoprecipitation. Hence, the peaks lost with DSG correspond to open chromatin regions (which are more subject to crosslinking artifacts in PFA-only) and do not represent true IKAROS binding sites. That makes sense. True IKAROS sites would be in regions where they are stably bound and crosslinked effectively with DSG. But in PFA-only, the crosslinking in open chromatin allows non-specific deposits. Wait, maybe when combining DSG with PFA, it reduces non-specific background, so the disappearing peaks are the non-specific ones. Alternatively, true IKAROS sites require both crosslinkers. But that contradicts the scenario where peaks disappear with DSG. So confusing.

Another point: Some TFs require DSG to be crosslinked properly. If IKAROS is one of them, then using PFA only may not effectively crosslink them. However, in the question, when using PFA only, they find peaks (which would paradoxically be weaker if crosslinking is bad, unless there is more background). Alternatively, DSG may inhibit the effect. Wait, the problem states that the peaks produced with PFA disappear when using DSG+PFA. So with both crosslinkers, the result is loss of peaks.

If the antibody is against IKAROS, a transcription factor, which is directly binding DNA, then enhanced crosslinking (DSG+PFA) should better preserve the TF-DNA interactions. But if PFA alone gives peaks, and adding DSG loses peaks, perhaps because the additional crosslinking traps the TF-DNA complexes in such a way that they are not accessible to the antibody. If DSG crosslinks IKAROS to other proteins that mask the epitope, the antibody can't bind. Therefore, the true binding sites don't get detected in DSG+PFA, leading to loss of peaks.

Alternatively, if the actual binding sites are mediated by a protein complex, but when you crosslink with DSG, the IKAROS epitope is somehow obscured.

Alternatively, the ChIP efficiency is diminished due to over-crosslinking, leading to loss of all peaks, but the question says only some peaks disappear, implying other peaks would remain. But the user says "peaks disappeared" in general when DSG was used.

Alternatively, perhaps the main issue is in the fixation-induced epitope masking. With antibodies used in ChIP, the crosslinking can impair recognition. DSG might crosslink regions of IKAROS needed for the antibody's epitope. Therefore, in cases where epitope is critical, DSG would reduce IP efficiency, eliminating genuine peaks but in reality the peaks would still be present—they’re just not detected. So those peaks (the ones in the PFA scenario) are genuine but are masked when DSG is added.

But where would such peaks be located? Probably actual IKAROS binding sites. The question says the peaks "disappeared when PFA+DSG." But the answer needs to relate to genomic regions where these peaks are found. If DSG causes epitope masking, then the true binding sites (like promoter regions, enhancers) would disappear as DSG is added, suggesting that somehow the answer is the true binding sites. But this contradicts standard practices where DSG is beneficial, not deleterious.

Alternatively, when DSG is added, it leads to better retention of true sites and the disappearance of non-specific or indirect binding. Therefore, peaks that disappear upon DSG addition would not be true sites. But if the true sites are those captured better with DSG, then the opposite.

But here in the question, the peaks only appear when using PFA (no DSG). Therefore, the disappearing peaks would be those that are false positives. The answer likely is that the disappearing peaks (present in PFA only) are located in regions of open chromatin where non-specific binding occurs. This is because in PFA conditions, open chromatin allows more crosslinking, leading to false peaks that are not present when DSG is added (possibly more specific crosslinking reduces this). But why would DSG reduce open chromatin artifacts?

Alternatively, regions that are heterochromatic or in a denser nuclear environment may not crosslink well with PFA alone but with DSG. Therefore, the peaks disappearing when using DSG+PFA are actually in open chromatin, as DSG would not be necessary there. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another possible explanation: ChIP-seq artifacts in PFA might not survive DSG fixation. Crosslinking can sometimes capture DNA-associated proteins transiently or loosely bound. If DSG+PFA fix cells more stringently, such transient interactions are not preserved (they might be washed away) because they are not crosslinked. But this seems contradictory. Normally, stronger fixation (DSG+PFA) might retain more interactions, increasing the number of peaks. But perhaps specifically, such combined fixation makes DNA-protein crosslinks too bulky, leading to poor sonication efficiency. If regions with low TF binding (e.g., open chromatin) are more sensitive to different fixation methods, leading to DNA that is not properly fragmented. Wait. Alternatively, the combination of DSG and PFA might improve crosslinking in protein complexes not directly bound to DNA but assist in ChIP of such cases. The presence of peaks with PFA and loss with DSG would suggest an inverse.

Alternatively, think about when using PFA, DNA-protein crosslinks are direct. DSG adds protein-protein crosslinks. If a protein is part of a complex but doesn't directly bind DNA, PFA might not crosslink it to DNA, but DSG would presumably crosslink it to a DNA-binding protein. However, this would lead to detection of the complex in the presence of DSG. But in this scenario, using DSG makes the peaks disappear, which in such a case might mean that the initial peaks in PFA directly attach IKAROS to DNA. If adding DSG somehow crosslinks IKAROS to other proteins, the DNA might be sheared away, getting no signal. For example, if IKAROS is connected via DSG to a nuclear matrix protein, then during sonication, the DNA fragments might be pulled into the pellet with matrix proteins, so they aren't in the supernatant for IP. Thus, the DNA regions around IKAROS (if crosslinked to non-DNA structures) might become insoluble.

Alternatively, the use of DSG may have altered epitope availability or caused crosslinking that makes the antibody bind less efficiently. If the peaks disappear because of that irrespective of genomic location, the answer might not be region-specific, which contradicts the question. Therefore, the genomic location is functional: indirect binding regions.

Given that IKAROS is a transcription factor involved in B cell development and binds directly to DNA, the disappearing peaks might be indicative of indirect binding through other proteins. So in PFA-only, some of the crosslinking captures IKAROS in proximity to DNA through interactions with other DNA-bound proteins, thus appearing as peaks. However, with DSG added, the protein-protein crosslinking stabilizes those interactions, but DNA fragmentation may separate the DNA fragments that were originally co-purifying with IKAROS. But in ChIP, fragment sizes are sheared around the crosslinking points, so if IKAROS is crosslinked via another protein to DNA, then the DNA region adjacent to that protein might co-purify. If DSG holds proteins together but in a way that during sonication, the DNA breaks between regions crosslinked to the protein complex. Hmm, this is complex.

Alternatively, suppose IKAROS is part of a larger protein complex that is not directly bound to DNA. Using PFA alone, perhaps there's accidental crosslinking to nearby DNA regions, creating false peaks. DSG better crosslinks the complex, holding it together but not crosslinked to DNA, which then leads to no DNA fragments immunoprecipitating. Therefore, decreasing those false-positive peaks. Such false peaks would be more likely to occur near regions where such complexes are located, which might be near genes that are regulated by such complexes. But more specifically, in regions like enhancers or promoters, maybe, but not sure.

Alternatively, considering chromatin configuration: regions where DNA is in a more open state (like regulatory elements such as promoters or enhancers) with surrounding proteins might be prone to more crosslinking in PFA-only, creating artifactual signals. Adding DSG crosslinks proteins more securely but not the DNA-protein link, leading to loss of such peaks. However, actual IKAROS binding sites would be crosslinked in PFA and in PFA+DSG. So perhaps the disappearing peaks are not at true binding sites but at regions of open chromatin. Therefore, the correct answer would be that the disappearing peaks are in open chromatin regions where non-specific or indirect binding occurs. True binding sites (like promoters of IKAROS target genes) would persist. However, since with DSG they disappear, which would conflict unless the real binding sites require DSG for detection. But in the example here, DSG abolishes the peaks. Therefore, substitute, the peaks observed in PFA only are representing regions where the actual TF was not bound but crosslinked artifactually. Since the true binding would persist even with DSG.

Alternatively, if PFA does not effectively crosslink IKAROS to DNA, but using an antibody with a high background detects noise in PFA (while DSG reduces noise via enhancing specific crosslinks), then the peaks that disappear with addition of DSG would be in regions of open chromatin. Concluding that the disappearing peaks are likely found in open chromatin regions where non-specific crosslinking occurs with PFA fixation alone, and DSG suppresses such artifacts, suggesting the original peaks were false positives. Therefore, the answer is that the disappearing peaks are most likely located in open chromatin regions.
