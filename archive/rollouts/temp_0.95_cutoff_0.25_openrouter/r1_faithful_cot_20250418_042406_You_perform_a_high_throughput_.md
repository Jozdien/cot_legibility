# Original Question

You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? 
After tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:
- resistance of g1: 75% of control
- resistance of g2: 0% from control
- resistance of g3: 50% from control
-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control
- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control
- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control

Which conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?

Based on the experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn about the genetic interactions:

1. **Epistatic Relationships**:
   - **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**: The resistance of double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) is 0%, identical to the g2 single mutant. This indicates that G2 acts downstream of G1 and G3. If G2 is non-functional, disrupting G1 or G3 has no additional effect, as G2 is essential for their contributions to resistance.

2. **G1 and G3 Function in Partially Redundant Pathways**:
   - The g1g3 double mutant exhibits **10% resistance**, lower than either single mutant (g1: 75%, g3: 50%). This suggests G1 and G3 act in *independent pathways* that synergistically contribute to resistance. Loss of both genes severely compromises resistance, but some residual activity (10%) implies minor compensatory mechanisms not involving G2.

3. **Hierarchy and Role of G2**:
   - **G2 is critical for full resistance** (0% in g2), likely functioning as a **transcription factor** at the **convergence point** of pathways involving G1 and G3. G1 and G3 regulate or enhance G2’s activity (e.g., via signaling or co-activation), but G2 itself is indispensable. This explains why knocking out G2 alone abolishes resistance entirely, whereas upstream disruptions (g1, g3) only partially reduce it.

**Summary**:  
**G2** is a downstream transcription factor essential for anthracnose resistance, integrating inputs from **G1** and **G3**, which act in parallel pathways. The severe phenotype of g2 mutants (0% resistance) and the epistatic interactions (double mutants with g2) highlight G2’s central role. In contrast, G1 and G3 contribute additively/synergistically, with their combined loss (g1g3) leaving minimal residual resistance likely mediated by non-G2 pathways. This aligns with the observation that at least one transcription factor (G2) acts upstream of other genes in the resistance pathway.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's try to figure out the interactions between these genes based on the resistance data. So, the wild-type has 100% resistance, and the mutants have reduced resistance. The goal is to determine which gene is the transcription factor upstream of the others and how they interact.

First, let's list out the individual mutants and their resistance levels. g1 has 75%, which is a moderate decrease. g2 is 0%, which is a complete loss of resistance. g3 is 50%, so that's a significant drop too. The double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, which is even lower than either single mutant. But the other double mutants (g2g3, g1g2) are all 0%. 

Hmmm. So if a double mutant has a lower resistance than either single mutant, that suggests that the two genes act in parallel pathways, and disrupting both makes the plant more susceptible. But when the double mutant is the same as the more severe single mutant, maybe one gene is epistatic to the other. 

For example, if gene A is upstream of gene B, then knocking out A would block the pathway, and knocking out B wouldn't have an additive effect. So if you have a double mutant of A and B, the resistance would be the same as A alone. Alternatively, if B is upstream of A, then the double mutant would be the same as B alone.

Looking at the data:

g2 is 0%, so that's already a total loss. When combined with g1 (g1g2) or g3 (g2g3), the resistance is still 0%. So this suggests that g2 is epistatic to both g1 and g3. Because even if you knock out g1 or g3 in addition to g2, you don't get any worse than g2's phenotype. But wait, g2 is already 0%, so adding another mutation can't make it lower. So this makes sense.

Then look at g1 and g3. The single mutants are 75% and 50%. The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is much lower than either single mutant. That suggests that g1 and g3 are acting in separate pathways (they don't fully depend on each other), so when both are knocked out, the resistance is a combination of both effects. If they were in the same pathway, the double mutant might be similar to the worse single mutant. For example, if one is downstream of the other, the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the upstream gene. But since it's lower, they might function in parallel.

Wait, but how does this fit with the transcription factor aspect? The question says at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So a transcription factor could regulate the other genes. So maybe one of these genes (the TF) controls the others.

If g2 is a transcription factor upstream of g1 and g3, then knocking out g2 would disable both g1 and g3. But in that case, the g2 mutant would have a very low resistance (which it does; 0%), and the g1 and g3 mutants would be downstream. However, the fact that knocking out g1 or g3 individually still reduces resistance suggests that they have their own roles. 

Alternatively, if g3 is the TF. Wait, if there's an upstream gene, then the TF would regulate the downstream genes. If the TF is non-functional, the downstream genes wouldn't be expressed. So, for example, if G2 is the TF controlling G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Then the g2 mutant would have the same or worse phenotype than g1 or g3. Since g2 alone is 0% which is worse than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%), maybe g2 is not the upstream gene here. Because if g2 is upstream and not working, then the genes it controls (maybe g1 and g3) would not work either. Therefore, the resistance loss would be more than either g1 or g3. Or perhaps the upstream gene (TF) controls a pathway that includes the other genes.

Alternatively, let's think about epistasis. If gene A is upstream of gene B, then the phenotype of a mutant in A would mask the effect of B. For example, if A is required for B's function, then a mutation in A would make a mutation in B irrelevant. So, the double mutant would look like A's mutant.

Looking at the data again: When g2 is combined with either g1 or g3, the resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. So, maybe g2 is epistatic to g1 and g3, meaning that if g2 is non-functional, knocking out g1 or g3 doesn't add anything because their function is already blocked. That would suggest that G2 acts downstream of g1 and g3. Because if you have a mutation in an upstream gene, the downstream gene's mutation shouldn't alter the phenotype; if you have a downstream mutation, an upstream mutation would not add to the phenotype. Wait, this is the concept of epistatic interaction. Let me recall that.

If gene A is epistatic to gene B (A is downstream), then a mutation in A would block the pathway regardless of B. So, genotype aabb would have the same phenotype as aaB_, since A is non-functional. Similarly, if gene B is epistatic to A (B is downstream), then the pathway is blocked when B is non-functional, and mutations in A wouldn't matter.

Alternatively, if two genes are in parallel pathways, then each contributes independently to the trait, so their double mutant would have a more severe phenotype than either single.

So, looking at g1 and g3 single mutants (75% and 50%), and double mutant is 10%. That's much lower than additive (75% * 50%?), Wait, but maybe it's multiplicative. Suppose each gene provides partial resistance, and their effects multiply when both are present. Wait, wild type is 100%, and mutants have less. So, more like the resistance is 100% when all genes are functional, and the mutations reduce it.

Wait, the percentages are relative to the wild-type. So let's think of each gene contributing a certain part:

If G1 and G3 act in parallel pathways, then the resistance might be the product of their individual contributions. For instance, if G1 mutation reduces it to 75% (so missing 25% of resistance), and G3 to 50% (missing 50%), then if they act independently, the double mutation might be 75% * 50% = 37.5%? But the actual double mutant is 10%, which is lower. Alternatively, they may have additive effects. But additive would be tricky here. If they each contribute additive fractions. Wait, perhaps the 75% and 50% are the remaining functions. So without G1, the plant still has 75% resistance. Without G3, 50%. If they function in parallel, the total resistance would be the product of 75% (G1's contribution) and 50% (G3's contribution) => 37.5% resistance. But in the actual data, the double mutant is 10%, lower than that. That suggests that these genes synergize or have some interaction beyond being additive.

Alternatively, perhaps the genes are in the same pathway, but how?

If G3 is acting downstream of G1. So, when G1 is absent, G3's path is not activated. Then, a g1 mutant would have lower resistance. A g3 mutant would also have lower resistance, overlapping the same pathway. The double mutant may have the same as the more severe single mutant. But in reality, the double mutant is worse than either. So this suggests that the pathways are not entirely linear.

Alternatively, there's a hierarchy. If the transcription factor regulates others. Let me consider which gene could be the TF. Given that at least one is TF upstream. From the data, g2's mutant has 0% resistance, so maybe G2 is downstream. Because if the TF is upstream (like a regulatory gene) and that's missing, then the downstream genes aren't activated.

For example: Let's say G1 is the transcription factor that activates both G2 and G3. If G1 is knocked out (g1), then G2 and G3 are not expressed. So the resistance would be the same as if all three are knocked out. But in reality, g1 alone has 75% resistance. So that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe G2 is the transcription factor. If G2 is upstream and activates G1 and G3. In the g2 mutant, G1 and G3 are not expressed, so resistance is 0%. However, in the g1 and g3 mutants, they may have their own contributions. For example, if G1 and G3 are both targets of G2, then in the absence of G2, neither is active, giving 0% resistance (as observed). If only G1 is knocked out, but G3 is active (because G2 is still working), then resistance is 75%. Similarly, knocking out G3 and keeping G1 active would give 50%. But why would the double mutant g1g3 be 10%?

But if G2 activates G1 and G3, but each of them can also have some independent activity, maybe through other pathways. But knockouts of G1 and G3 would lower resistance. If G2 (the TF) is intact, knocking out G1 and G3 would leave some residual resistance, but in the double mutant (g1g3), which has knocked out both, the resistance would be even lower. But how does that account for 10%?

Alternatively, maybe another scenario where G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3. Here's another approach: start by hypothesizing which gene is the transcription factor. Let's say that G2 is the transcription factor, and it is regulated by G1 and G3. If G2 requires both G1 and G3 to be active. So, if either G1 or G3 are non-functional, then G2 can't work properly. Let's check the data.

Wait, but that may not fit. If G2's function depends on G1 and G3, then in g1 mutant, G2 is non-functional. Therefore, g1 mutant would have the same resistance as g2 mutant. But in reality, g1 is 75% vs. g2 at 0%. So that probably isn't correct.

Another possibility is that G1 and G3 contribute to the activation of G2, but this seems off because the resistance levels don't stack. 

Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are in two separate pathways, and G2 is part of one of them, but acts upstream. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, ignore the TF for a moment and just try to figure out the hierarchy.

Looking at the single and double mutants:

- g2 has resistance 0%. Any double mutant involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3) also has 0%. So if you're missing G2, nothing else matters. That suggests G2 is in a pathway downstream of G1 and G3, so that all effects of G1 and G3 require G2. If G2 is non-functional, adding a knockout of G1 or G3 has no effect. Therefore, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So, if G2 is downstream. If G1 and G3 act upstream of G2, and G2 is necessary for their function, then null mutants in G1 and/or G3 would partially affect resistance (because there might be other pathways), but G2 being knocked out would nullify any contribution from upstream genes, leading to 0%.

But why does the g2 mutant have 0% but the g1 and g3 mutants have partial resistances?

If G2 is downstream and essential for resistance, but there are other pathways (so G1 and G3 contribute through G2 or other pathways). Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If the plant uses either G1 or G3 to activate G2. So if G1 is knocked out, G3 can still activate G2, leading to 75% resistance. If G3 is knocked out, G1 can activate G2, leading to 50% resistance. If both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), then G2 isn't activated, leading to 10%, which suggests that there's some residual activation possible. But then why does the g2 mutant have 0%? If activation of G2 is the main pathway, but there are other minor pathways.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the main contributing gene, and G1 and G3 contribute additional pathways. But if enough pathways are defective, resistance drops more. The problem is how the combinations work.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try a different angle.

The key thing mentioned is that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So maybe G1, for example, is a TF activating G2 and G3. So if G1 is broken (g1), then neither G2 nor G3 are activated, leading to the resistance of 75%?

But then why would a g1 mutant have higher resistance (75%) than a g2 mutant (0%)? That makes no sense because if G2 is downstream of G1, then the double mutants would have the same resistance as the g2 mutant, which is 0%. But g1 is just 75%, which is less than wild type but not totally gone.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is a repressor, and the upstream part is a different set. No, probably better to think of TFs as activators unless stated otherwise.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the TF that acts upstream. If G2 is knocked out (0%), then downstream genes (like G1 and G3) can't be activated. But the wild-type needs G2 to transcribe those downstream genes. But then why do mutations in G1 and G3 have their own effects? For instance, if G1 is a downstream target of G2, then the g1 mutant shouldn't have resistance unless there's another pathway. But in reality, the g1 mutant's resistance is 75%, so perhaps G2 is still active, allowing G3 to work, but via a different pathway. So if G2 is a TF regulating G1 and another gene (but G3 is independent), or G2 is regulating G3 and G1? This is getting tangled.

Wait, another angle. In cases where the double mutant is the same as the most severe single mutant, that gene is usually epistatic. For example, look at g1g2: resistance is 0%. The same as g2 (but g1 is 75%). So here, g2 is epistatic to g1. That implies that G2 acts downstream of G1, so that knocking out G2 masks the effect of G1.

Similarly, when g2 and g3 are knocked out together, the resistance is 0% (same as g2 alone), which would suggest that G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3.

Meanwhile, in the double mutant g1g3 (75% and 50% single), it's 10% resistance. That's lower than either, which is called synergistic epistasis. That means that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that contribute additively or synergistically to the resistance. So if you have a defect in both pathways, the resistance plummets.

Putting this together:

- The g2 mutations result in complete loss of resistance (0%) and are epistatic to mutations in g1 and g3, placing G2 downstream of both G1 and G3. So G1 and G3 function upstream of G2. This fits with G2 being a downstream gene. However, there's the aspect of the transcription factor.

Wait, the problem states that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. So maybe one of the genes G1, G2, G3 is an upstream TF. If G2 is downstream, perhaps it's not the TF. If G1 or G3 is the upstream TF.

But if G2 is downstream and required for resistance, maybe G1 or G3 is a TF that activates G2.

Looking again at the g1 mutant: 75% resistance. If G1 is a TF that activates G2, then in a g1 mutant, G2 isn't expressed. But in the data, the g2 mutant is 0% resistance, but the g1 is 75%— higher than g2. That doesn't align because if G1 activates G2, then a g1 mutant should have the same or lower resistance than g2. However, here g1 has higher, so that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is repressing a repressor. Complexity is increasing. Alternatively, G3 is the TF. g3 mutant is 50%; suppose g3 is upstream, activating both G1 and G2. Then in a g3 mutant, both G1 and G2 are not activated, leading to lower resistance. Wait, but the g3 mutant is only 50%, but in reality, if both G1 and G2 are off, maybe resistance is or it's similar to g1g2, which is 0%. But according to data, the g3 mutant is 50%, which is greater than g1g2=0%. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G1 is the TF. If G1 regulates G2 and G3. Then, in the g1 mutant, both G2 and G3 would be non-functional, leading to a lower resistance. But in reality, the g1 mutant's resistance is 75%-- better than g2 and g3 mutants. Which contradicts that.

Wait, another possibility: G2 is the TF, but it's downstream such that even if G1 and G3 are knocked out, as long as G2 is functional, the plant has partial resistance. For example:

- G2 is the main gene mediating resistance, functioning downstream. G1 and G3 enhance G2's function. So in the g1 mutant, G2's function is impaired but still works at 75%. Similarly, in g3 mutant, G2's function is impaired to 50%. But in the g2 mutant, G2 is completely gone, hence 0% resistance. The double mutants of g1 and g3 have a further decreased function of G2, but not turning it off entirely, leaving 10% resistance. However, when paired with g2, the function is 0%.

But this is speculative. However, this would fit if G1 and G3 are co-factors for G2. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are involved in different pathways that regulate G2, but if those pathways are additive, then loss of both reduces G2's activity to almost nil (10%).

But how does that fit with G2 being a transcription factor? If G2 is the critical TF, then yes, mutants of G2 result in complete loss, whereas if you impair its regulation through G1 and G3, you only lose partial function.

Alternatively, perhaps the situation is that G1 and G3 act in separate pathways converging on G2, which integrates their signals. If G2 is a TF that activates defense genes. So G1 provides some input that activates G2, and G3 provides another. So in the absence of G1, G2 can still be partially activated by G3, leading to 75% resistance. In the absence of G3, G1 partially activates G2, 50% resistance. But if both are absent, G2 activation is low (10%). However, g2 mutant has 0% because G2 is completely inactive. This fits. So in this model, G2 is the downstream TF, and G1 and G3 are upstream modulators that can activate G2 through different pathways. The double mutant g1g3 has very little activation of G2, hence low resistance. But when G2 is non-functional (g2 mutant), even if G1 and/or G3 are active, the system fails entirely. This makes G2 epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So the conclusion would be that G2 is the downstream transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3, which contribute additively/synergistically to its activation. Hence, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 act in separate pathways leading to G2.

Okay, let's try to figure out the interactions between these genes based on the resistance data. So, the wild-type has 100% resistance, and the mutants have reduced resistance. The goal is to determine which gene is the transcription factor upstream of the others and how they interact.

First, let's list out the individual mutants and their resistance levels. g1 has 75%, which is a moderate decrease. g2 is 0%, which is a complete loss of resistance. g3 is 50%, so that's a significant drop too. The double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, which is even lower than either single mutant. But the other double mutants (g2g3, g1g2) are all 0%. 

Hmmm. So if a double mutant has a lower resistance than either single mutant, that suggests that the two genes act in parallel pathways, and disrupting both makes the plant more susceptible. But when the double mutant is the same as the more severe single mutant, maybe one gene is epistatic to the other. 

For example, if gene A is upstream of gene B, then knocking out A would block the pathway, and knocking out B wouldn't have an additive effect. So if you have a double mutant of A and B, the resistance would be the same as A alone. Alternatively, if B is upstream of A, then the double mutant would be the same as B alone.

Looking at the data:

g2 is 0%, so that's already a total loss. When combined with g1 (g1g2) or g3 (g2g3), the resistance is still 0%. So this suggests that g2 is epistatic to both g1 and g3. Because even if you knock out g1 or g3 in addition to g2, you don't get any worse than g2's phenotype. But wait, g2 is already 0%, so adding another mutation can't make it lower. So this makes sense.

Then look at g1 and g3. The single mutants are 75% and 50%. The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is much lower than either single mutant. That suggests that g1 and g3 are acting in separate pathways (they don't fully depend on each other), so when both are knocked out, the resistance is a combination of both effects. If they were in the same pathway, the double mutant might be similar to the worse single mutant. For example, if one is downstream of the other, the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the upstream gene. But since it's lower, they might function in parallel.

Wait, but how does this fit with the transcription factor aspect? The question says at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So a transcription factor could regulate the other genes. So maybe one of these genes (the TF) controls the others.

If g2 is a transcription factor upstream of g1 and g3, then knocking out g2 would disable both g1 and g3. But in that case, the g2 mutant would have a very low resistance (which it does; 0%), and the g1 and g3 mutants would be downstream. However, the fact that knocking out g1 or g3 individually still reduces resistance suggests that they have their own roles. 

Alternatively, if g3 is the TF. Wait, if there's an upstream gene, then the TF would regulate the downstream genes. If the TF is non-functional, the downstream genes wouldn't be expressed. So, for example, if G2 is the TF controlling G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Then the g2 mutant would have the same or worse phenotype than g1 or g3. Since g2 alone is 0% which is worse than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%), maybe g2 is not the upstream gene here. Because if g2 is upstream and not working, then the genes it controls (maybe g1 and g3) would not work either. Therefore, the resistance loss would be more than either g1 or g3. Or perhaps the upstream gene (TF) controls a pathway that includes the other genes.

Alternatively, let's think about epistasis. If gene A is upstream of gene B, then the phenotype of a mutant in A would mask the effect of B. For example, if A is required for B's function, then a mutation in A would make a mutation in B irrelevant. So, the double mutant would look like A's mutant.

Looking at the data again: When g2 is combined with either g1 or g3, the resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. So, maybe g2 is epistatic to g1 and g3, meaning that if g2 is non-functional, knocking out g1 or g3 doesn't add anything because their function is already blocked. That would suggest that G2 acts downstream of g1 and g3. Because if you have a mutation in an upstream gene, the downstream gene's mutation shouldn't alter the phenotype; if yo

# Anthropic completion

Alright, let's analyze the gene interactions based on the resistance data. The wild-type exhibits 100% resistance, while mutants show reduced levels. Our task is to identify which gene acts as the upstream transcription factor and understand their relationships.

Looking at individual mutants, g1 shows 75% resistance (moderate decrease), g2 shows 0% (complete loss), and g3 shows 50% (significant drop). For double mutants, g1g3 has 10% resistance (lower than either single mutant), while both g2g3 and g1g2 have 0% resistance.

When a double mutant displays lower resistance than either single mutant, this suggests the genes function in parallel pathways, as disrupting both increases susceptibility. Conversely, if a double mutant resembles the more severe single mutant, one gene may be epistatic to the other.

For instance, if gene A acts upstream of gene B, knocking out A would block the pathway, making an additional knockout of B irrelevant. Thus, an A-B double mutant would resemble the A mutant alone. Similarly, if B is upstream of A, the double mutant would match the B mutant.

Examining our data:
The g2 mutant already shows 0% resistance, and combining it with either g1 or g3 maintains this 0% level. This suggests g2 is epistatic to both g1 and g3, as additional mutations don't worsen the phenotype beyond g2's effect. However, this could simply be because resistance can't drop below 0%.

For g1 and g3, the single mutants show 75% and 50% resistance respectively, while their double mutant (g1g3) shows just 10%. This significantly lower resistance in the double mutant indicates g1 and g3 likely operate in separate pathways rather than one controlling the other. If they were in the same pathway, we'd expect the double mutant to resemble the worse single mutant.

Regarding the transcription factor aspect, if g2 were a transcription factor controlling g1 and g3, knocking out g2 would disable both g1 and g3, resulting in very low resistance (which matches our 0% observation). However, the fact that individual knockouts of g1 and g3 still reduce resistance suggests they have independent roles.

Alternatively, considering epistasis: when a gene acts upstream of another, its mutation masks the downstream gene's effect. Looking at our data again, when g2 is combined with either g1 or g3, the resistance remains at 0%, identical to g2 alone. This could mean g2 is epistatic to g1 and g3, suggesting that if g2 is non-functional, mutations in g1 or g3 become irrelevant because their function is already blocked. This pattern suggests G2 might act downstream of g1 and g3, as upstream mutations typically mask the effects of downstream mutations.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's analyze the interactions between these genes using the resistance data. The wild-type shows 100% resistance, while the mutants have decreased resistance. Our objective is to identify which gene acts as the transcription factor upstream of the others and to understand their interactions.

Let's start by listing the individual mutants and their resistance levels. Gene g1 shows 75% resistance, which is a moderate reduction. Gene g2 has 0% resistance, indicating a complete loss. Gene g3 exhibits 50% resistance, which is a significant decrease. Looking at the double mutants, g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is much lower than either single mutant. However, other double mutants like g2g3 and g1g2 both have 0% resistance.

If a double mutant exhibits lower resistance than any single mutant, it suggests that the two genes function in parallel pathways, and disrupting both increases susceptibility. Conversely, if a double mutant shows the same resistance as the more severe single mutant, it may indicate one gene is epistatic to the other. For example, if gene A is upstream of gene B, then knocking out gene A would block the pathway, and removing gene B wouldn't produce an additive effect. In a double mutant of A and B, the resistance would match that of A alone. Conversely, if B is upstream of A, the double mutant would resemble B's phenotype.

Reviewing the data: Gene g2 shows 0% resistance. When combined with g1 (g1g2) or g3 (g2g3), the resistance remains at 0%. This indicates that g2 is epistatic to both g1 and g3 because even when g1 or g3 are knocked out alongside g2, the resistance doesn't drop below the level of g2's phenotype. This is logical since g2 is already at 0%, so additional mutations wouldn't decrease it further.

Now consider g1 and g3. The single mutants exhibit 75% and 50% resistance, respectively. The double mutant g1g3 falls to 10%, significantly lower than either single mutant. This implies g1 and g3 function in separate pathways, and when both are knocked out, the reduced resistance reflects the combination of both effects. If they functioned within the same pathway, the double mutant might resemble the more severe single mutant, indicating that the two genes likely operate in parallel.

Then, considering the transcription factor role, the question implies at least one gene is an upstream transcription factor. A transcription factor could regulate the other genes, which suggests that one of these genes might control the others. If g2 is a transcription factor upstream of g1 and g3, removing g2 would disable both g1 and g3. Consequently, the g2 mutant would show very low resistance (which it does, with 0%), suggesting g1 and g3 are downstream. However, the fact that individual knockouts of g1 or g3 still reduce resistance suggests that these genes play independent roles.

Alternatively, if g3 is the transcription factor, it would regulate the downstream genes. In this case, a non-functional transcription factor should result in non-expression of the downstream genes. If g2 were the TF controlling g1 and g3, the g2 mutant would exhibit resistance similar to or worse than g1 or g3, due to both G1 and G3 being non-expressed. But since g2 alone is 0%, which is worse than both g1 (75%) and g3 (50%), it’s likely not the upstream gene. If g2 were upstream and non-functional, it would disrupt the genes it controls. Therefore, the upstream gene (TF) might oversee a pathway that includes the other genes.

Alternatively, let's consider epistasis again. If gene A is upstream of gene B, the phenotype of an A mutant would mask B's function. For example, if A's presence is necessary for B's function, an A mutation would render a B mutation irrelevant. Thus, the double mutant would resemble A's phenotype.

Reexamining the data: When g2 is combined with either g1 or g3, the resistance remains at 0%, similar to g2 alone. This suggests g2 is epistatic to g1 and g3, indicating that if g2 is non-functional, knocking out g1 or g3 doesn’t change the outcome because their function is already impacted. This reasoning implies g2 may act as a downstream component of pathways involving g1 and g3.

But wait, in the g1g3 double mutant, why is it 10% instead of just 0%? Maybe there's a residual effect.\n\nWait, but maybe G2 is acting in a completely separate pathway. So if G2 is knocked out, resistance is entirely gone (0%), whereas the G1/G3 pathway when both are knocked out reduces resistance only to 10%, suggesting that maybe there's a small contribution from another factor. Anyway, given the numbers, perhaps G2 is in a pathway that's critical for resistance, and G1 and G3 are in another pathway that contributes less. But when both pathways are disabled (but in the experiments, how?), since G2 if knocked out alone is 0%, then even if you restore G1 and G3, but the pathways aren't additive here. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is different. \n\nAnother approach is to consider if any combination of genes shows an additive effect. For instance, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%: if they are in separate pathways, their double mutant might have 75% * 50% = 37.5%, but the measured value is 10%, which is less than additive. That suggests the effect is synergistic when both are knocked out. So maybe they have some overlapping function. Or perhaps it's because they function in the same pathway, and knocking both out completely incapacitates it. But then why isn't the double mutant 0%? Unless there's residual activity. Hmmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the function of G1 and G3 are partially redundant, so in the single mutants, the remaining gene partially compensates, but the double mutant loses all redundancy. But why then the double mutant is 10% instead of, say, 0%? Maybe there's another gene involved that's not studied here.\n\nAlternatively, consider that G2 is a transcription factor required for either the expression of G1 and/or G3. If G2 is not functional (as in g2 mutant), then G1 and G3 are not expressed, and thus resistance is completely lost (0%). In the wild type, G2 activates G1 and G3. If G1 is knocked out, then G2 is still active, but one target (G1) isn't. Since resistance in g1 is 75%, that suggests G2 is still able to work through G3 in part. Similarly, if G3 is knocked out (50%), G2 works through G1. When both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), then even though G2 is active, it can't activate either target, leading to very low resistance (10%). But then why isn't it 0%? Maybe there's an alternative pathway independent of G2, contributing that 10%. But according to the problem, we're only considering these three genes, so maybe that 10% is an experimental error or an artifact.\n\nAlternatively, the transcription factor is G1 or G3. Let's see. Suppose G1 is the TF regulating G3. Then in g1 mutant, G3 function would also be affected. But in the data, g1 mutant has 75%, and g3 mutant has 50%; if G3 were downstream of G1, then knocking out G1 would lead to the same or worse phenotype as G3. But g1's resistance is higher (75%) than g3's (50%), which would contradict that. So that can't be. Similarly, if G3 is the TF regulating G1, then knocking out G3 would disable G1, leading to a more severe phenotype than g1 alone. But here, g3 has 50% which is worse than g1 (75%), so maybe. If G3 regulates G1, then in g3 mutant, both G1 and G3 are non-functional, leading to a worse phenotype. Wait, but G3 being a TF that upregulates G1. So if G3 is knocked out, G1 isn't expressed. Then the g3 mutant's resistance should be equal to the g1g3 double mutant. However, the g3 mutant is 50%, and the g1g3 is 10%, which is lower, so that doesn't fit. So this model seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transcription factor is acting upstream of both G1 and G3, such as if G2 is the TF. If G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, then in g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Thus, the resistance should be lower than either g1 or g3. In the data, g2 is 0%, which is lower than both (75% and 50%). So in that case, the g2 mutant would have no G1 or G3 function. Then, the single mutants (g1 or g3) would each have one functional gene (G3 or G1, respectively). So their resistances would be less than the wild type but not as low as g2. Looking at the double mutant g1g3, which would be equivalent to g2 (0%), but according to the data, it's 10%. That doesn't match. The problem states that the resistance of g1g3 is 10%, whereas g2 is 0%. So that would suggest that the g1g3 double mutant is different from g2. So perhaps G2 is not the TF that activates both G1 and G3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two of the genes are downstream of the third. So suppose G1 is the TF that activates both G2 and G3. If G1 is knocked out (g1), then resistance is 75%, which is reduced, but not to 0% like when G2 is knocked out. That would suggest that even without G1, there is some residual activity. However, if in the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are not expressed, the resistance should be similar to g2 (severe). But here, in g1 it's only 75% loss. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, G2 is a component downstream of G1 and G3. In this case, if G2 is non-functional (g2 mutant), resistance is 0%. If G1 or G3 is non-functional, the pathways upstream of G2 are partially compromised, but G2 can still function in some capacity. For example, G1 and G3 might encode components that activate G2. So in g1 or g3 mutants, activation of G2 is reduced, leading to lowered resistance. When both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), activation of G2 is minimal, leading to 10% resistance. However, the data says that the g2 mutant is 0%, and g1g3 is 10%. That 10% suggests that even without G1 and G3, there's a little resistance. If G2 were downstream, then knocking out G2 would result in 0%, but if you knock out G1 and G3, the input to G2 is gone, so maybe G2 can't be activated, hence 10%? Hmmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a separate pathway from G2. Then resistance would be additive. For example, in wild type, both pathways give 100%. If you knock out G1 (75%) and G3 (50%), perhaps the remaining pathways contribute to that. However, when you knock out both G1 and G3 (10%), you have minimal resistance left, which might come from G2's pathway. But since knocking out G2 alone gives 0%, which would suggest that G2's pathway is necessary for the remaining resistance in the g1g3 double mutant. Wait, in this model, if the 10% in g1g3 comes from G2 activity, but when G2 is knocked out, it's 0%. Then combining g1g3 with g2 (the triple mutant) would be 0%, which they couldn't test here. But in the data provided, the double mutants are only up to two knocked out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a hierarchy. Let's imagine a linear pathway: G1 -> G3 -> G2. If the pathway is G1 activates G3, which activates G2. Then, if you knock out G1, then G3 and G2 are not activated, leading to the same phenotype as G2 (0% resistance). But in reality, g1 is 75%. So that's incompatible. Alternatively, the pathway is reversed: G2 -> G1 -> G3. Then knocking out G2 would block the entire pathway, resulting in 0% resistance. Knocking out G1 would prevent activation of G3, so resistance would be lower. But according to the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, suggesting they function in separate pathways. Alternatively, maybe G2 is involved in the main pathway, and G1 and G3 are part of a secondary pathway.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at the key points again:\n\n- If we consider that when you knock out G2, resistance is completely gone (0%). All double mutants involving G2 are also 0%. So any combination with G2 being out results in 0%. This suggests that G2 is crucial, and its loss cannot be compensated by the others.\n\n- Meanwhile, the double mutant g1g3 has a resistance lower than either single mutant. So maybe G1 and G3 work in a separate pathway that, when both are lost, causes a more severe phenotype. But since their double mutant isn't 0%, but 10%, there's a tiny bit of resistance left. This could suggest that the pathway involving G2 contributes that remaining 10%, but in the presence of a functional G2.\n\nWait, wait. Let's clarify:\n\nIf in the g1g3 double mutant, G2 is still functional, since they only knocked out G1 and G3. In that case, g1g3 should still have G2 active, but according to the data, their resistance is 10%. So if G2 is active in the g1g3 plant, but they have 10% resistance whereas in wild type it's 100%, and in g2 it's 0%, this could indicate that G1 and G3 are part of a pathway that enhances G2's function. So in the absence of G1 and G3, G2's ability to confer resistance is only 10%, but normally, G1 and G3 boost it to 100%. Alternatively, maybe there are two pathways: one is independent G2 (which when active, gives some resistance but not full), and another pathway involving G1 and G3, which contribute additively. But when all three are wild type, the total resistance is the sum. But when you knock out G1 and G3, only G2's pathway is active, but it's not enough (only 10%). Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the G2 pathway can confer some basal resistance (e.g., 10%), and the G1/G3 pathway adds the remaining 90%. But if G2 is knocked out (0%), then even if G1 and G3 are functional, they can't contribute anything, which doesn't fit because then in the wild type, you'd have 10% + 90% = 100%. But if that's the case, the G1/G3 pathway depends entirely on G2. So knocking out G2 would nullify the G1/G3 pathway, leading to 0%. However, when you knock out G1 and G3, you still have the 10% from G2, hence g1g3 is 10%. But then when you knock out G2 (which is the source of that 10%), the double mutants with G2 (g1g2, g2g3) would combine to give 0%, which they do. And the g1g3 is 10%, which is from remaining G2 activity. This seems to fit.\n\nSo, in that model, G2 is a transcription factor that controls a basal pathway (10% resistance), and G1 and G3 are part of a different pathway (possibly activated by G2) that contributes 90% of resistance. Let me see:\n\nWild type: G2 is active (10%) + G1 and G3 pathway (90%) → 100%.\n\ng2 mutant: Can't contribute the 10%, and G1/G3 pathway also not active (since maybe they are downstream) → 0%.\n\nBut wait, in this model, the g1 and g3 mutants would have 10% plus part of the 90%:\n\ng1 mutant: G2 active (10%) + G3 part of the pathway. But since G1 is out, the  G1/G3 pathway is only 50% effective? So 10% + 50% = 60%, but the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, discrepancy. So this might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, G2 is a transcription factor required for the activation of either G1 or G3. Suppose G2 is required for G1 expression, and G1 is required for G3 expression. Then, in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Then, g2 mutant is 0%. g1 mutant would have no G1, but G3 is still expressed (since G1 is downstream). Wait, but if G1 is required for G3, then in g1 mutant, G3 is not expressed. Then g3 mutant also is 50%, which is less than g1 (0% maybe)? This is getting too convoluted.\n\nGiven the initial assumption from the problem that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of the others, so there must be some hierarchy. The key is that knocking out a gene upstream would cause the downstream genes to not function.\n\nIf, for example, G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Then, in a g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. However, if in reality, knocking out G2 alone gives 0%, but when G1 and G3 are individually knocked out, their mutants have higher resistance (75% and 50%). So that suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in pathways that do not require G2, or that G2 has a role separate from activating them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the TF (say G2) is not the sole activator. Like, there might be other TFs. But according to the problem, at least one of the three is a TF upstream of others.\n\nI think the answer might be that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3. Here's why:\n\n- When G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0% (all double mutants with G2 are also 0%).\n\n- The genes G1 and G3 when individually knocked out have higher resistance (75% and 50%), suggesting that they may function downstream of G2.\n\nThe double mutant g1g3 has lower resistance than either single mutant (10%), which suggests that when both downstream genes are inactive, they can't compensate for each other. However, even with both G1 and G3 inactive, there's a small residual resistance (10%), which might be some other pathway, but that's not considered here.\n\nAlternatively, G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that are both activated by G2. So G2 being a TF that activates both pathways: one through G1 and another through G3. In that case, knocking out G2 silences both, hence 0%. Knocking out G1 leaves the G3 pathway active (so resistance is 50% + some?), but why would g3's resistance be 50% and g1 be 75%? If G1's pathway contributes more than G3's. Like, G1 pathway contributes 75% and G3's 25%, so when either is knocked out, you have the other remaining.\n\nSorry, but let me organize this better.\n\nIf G2 is the upstream TF that activates both G1 and G3. Then, G1 and G3 each are part of separate pathways contributing to resistance. Let's say:\n\nWild type: 100% resistance comes from the sum of G1 pathway (75%) and G3 pathway (25%). So, if G1 is knocked out, you have 25% left (but in the data, g1's resistance is 75%). That contradicts. So maybe split differently. Alternatively, the pathways are overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, there's partial compensation between G1 and G3. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out one might only partially reduce resistance. For instance, if they both contribute 50% each, but there's partial overlap. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, it's epistatic. Let's suppose that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. That would mean that G2's function is downstream. But the way to tell is that if you have a double mutant between G2 and either G1 or G3, the phenotype is the same as G2. Which is the case here. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same resistance (0%) as g2. Which would suggest that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. When a gene is epistatic, it's downstream. So, epistasis implies that the downstream gene's mutation masks the effect of the upstream gene. So if G2 is downstream, then mutations in G2 will hide the effects of G1 and G3, because their products are upstream and their function requires G2 to be functioning. Thus, the double mutants would look like G2. Hence, the data fits this. Therefore, G2 is downstream of G1 and G3.\n\nSo the conclusion is that G1 and G3 act in a pathway that converges on G2. Therefore, G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3. But wait, the problem states that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So if G2 is downstream, the upstream ones would be G1 and/or G3, which are not necessarily TFs. But then the transcription factor must be upstream. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor, acting downstream, but how can that be? A transcription factor is usually upstream in regulatory terms. I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, (epistatic also can refer to gene order in a pathway). For example, let’s say a biochemical pathway: Gene A produces an enzyme that creates substrate for Gene B. If you knockout Gene A (upstream), Gene B can't function because there's no substrate. So the phenotype of A and the double mutant AB would both be the same as Gene A alone. Hence, Gene A is epistatic to Gene B. So epistatic mutations mask the phenotype of downstream mutations.\n\nIn this case, G2 mutations are epistatic to G1 and G3; hence, G2 is downstream. But if G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it's downstream in the regulatory pathway. For example, G1 and G3 induce the expression of G2, which then activates defense genes. Therefore, if G2 is not present (g2 mutant), it doesn't matter if G1 or G3 are functional, since G2 can't relay the signal. Hence, the double mutants are same as g2—epistatic. So G2 is downstream. But G2 is a transcription factor, which would then activate other genes.\n\nHence, in this model:\n\nG1 → signals to → G3 → which activates → G2 (TF) → activates defense genes → resistance.\n\nBut perhaps, but the data would require G1 and G3 mutations to be upstream.\n\nAlternatively, G2 is a TF that is activated by both G1 and G3. Thus, the output (resistance) depends on G2. If G2 is non-functional, resistance is zero, regardless of G1 and G3 status. If G2 is functional, then G1 and G3 influence the level of resistance (as their mutants reduce resistance by 25% and 50% respectively). The double mutant g1g3 would have both G1 and G3 defects, leading to less activation of G2, hence lower resistance (10%).\n\nThis seems possible. If G2 is functional in all cases except when it's mutated, then:\n\n- Wild type: G1 and G3 activate G2 fully → 100% resistance.\n\n- g1 mutant: G3 can still activate G2 partially →75%.\n\n- g3 mutant: G1 activates G2, but only up to 50% of normal.\n\n- g1g3 mutant: Minimal activation of G2 →10%.\n\n- g2 mutant: G2 is not functional →0%.\n\nThis fits the data. Therefore, G2 is the transcription factor downstream of G1 and G3, integrating their signals and activating resistance pathways. So the transcription factor is G2, acting downstream. But TFs are typically upstream in regulatory pathways. Hmm. But in this case, G1 and G3 could be signaling components that activate the TF G2. For example, G1 and G3 might be kinases or receptors that signal to G2, which then activates gene expression.\n\nThis seems possible. Therefore, the interaction is that G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3. So the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor required for resistance, and it is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning that G1 and G3 act upstream of G2 to regulate its activity.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744975732, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5255, prompt_tokens=1361, total_tokens=6616, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Based on the experimental data, the following conclusions can be drawn about the genetic interactions:

1. **G2 is a critical downstream transcription factor**:  
   - The complete loss of resistance in the **g2** mutant (0%) and all double mutants involving **g2** (g1g2, g2g3) indicates that G2 is essential for anthracnose resistance. Its phenotype is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2 acts **downstream** of these genes. If G2 is non-functional, resistance is abolished regardless of G1/G3 status. This aligns with G2 being a transcription factor that orchestrates defense responses after being regulated by upstream signals.

2. **G1 and G3 act upstream in parallel pathways**:  
   - Both G1 (75% resistance) and G3 (50% resistance) contribute independently to resistance, as their single mutants retain partial function. The **g1g3** double mutant (10% resistance) shows a synergistic reduction, indicating they function in **partially redundant pathways** that converge on G2. Loss of both G1 and G3 severely impairs the activation of G2, leading to near-complete susceptibility (10% residual resistance may arise from minor independent mechanisms).

3. **Hierarchical interaction**:  
   The data support a model where **G1 and G3 regulate the activity of the transcription factor G2**, which in turn drives resistance. For example:
   - G1 and G3 might encode signaling components (e.g., receptors or kinases) that activate G2.
   - G2 integrates these signals to induce defense-related gene expression. Without G2, downstream responses collapse entirely.

**Conclusion**:  
**G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3**, which function in parallel upstream pathways to regulate its activity. G2 is indispensable for resistance, while G1 and G3 modulate the strength of the defense response.

Suppose that there are two pathways contributing to resistance. One pathway is G2, which if knocked out, results in 0% resistance. The other pathway involves G1 and G3 working together. So, in wild type, both pathways are active. If you knock out G1 or G3 individually, their pathway is partially affected.

So if G2 is knocked out, resistance is entirely gone (0%), whereas the G1/G3 pathway when both are knocked out reduces resistance only to 10%, suggesting that maybe there's a small contribution from another factor.

Then the g3 mutant's resistance should be equal to the g1g3 double mutant. However, the g3 mutant is 50%, and the g1g3 is 10%, which is lower, so that doesn't fit. So this model seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe the transcription factor is acting upstream of both G1 and G3, such as if G2 is the TF. If G2 is a TF that activates both G1 and G3, then in g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Thus, the resistance should be lower than either g1 or g3. In the data, g2 is 0%, which is lower than both (75% and 50%). So in that case, the g2 mutant would have no G1 or G3 function. Then, the single mutants (g1 or g3) would each have one functional gene (G3 or G1, respectively). So their resistances would be less than the wild type but not as low as g2. Looking at the double mutant g1g3, which would be equivalent to g2 (0%), but according to the data, it's 10%. That doesn't match. The problem states that the resistance of g1g3 is 10%, whereas g2 is 0%. So that would suggest that the g1g3 double mutant is different from g2. So perhaps G2 is not the TF that activates both G1 and G3.

Alternatively, maybe two of the genes are downstream of the third. So suppose G1 is the TF that activates both G2 and G3. If G1 is knocked out (g1), then resistance is 75%, which is reduced, but not to 0% like when G2 is knocked out. That would suggest that even without G1, there is some residual activity. However, if in the g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are not expressed, the resistance should be similar to g2 (severe). But here, in g1 it's only 75% loss. So this seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, G2 is a component downstream of G1 and G3. In this case, if G2 is non-functional (g2 mutant), resistance is 0%. If G1 or G3 is non-functional, the pathways upstream of G2 are partially compromised, but G2 can still function in some capacity. For example, G1 and G3 might encode components that activate G2. So in g1 or g3 mutants, activation of G2 is reduced, leading to lowered resistance. When both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), activation of G2 is minimal, leading to 10% resistance. However, the data says that the g2 mutant is 0%, and g1g3 is 10%. That 10% suggests that even without G1 and G3, there's a little resistance. If G2 were downstream, then knocking out G2 would result in 0%, but if you knock out G1 and G3, the input to G2 is gone, so maybe G2 can't be activated, hence 10%? Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a separate pathway from G2. Then resistance would be additive. For example, in wild type, both pathways give 100%. If you knock out G1 (75%) and G3 (50%), perhaps the remaining pathways contribute to that. However, when you knock out both G1 and G3 (10%), you have minimal resistance left, which might come from G2's pathway. But since knocking out G2 alone gives 0%, which would suggest that G2's pathway is necessary for the remaining resistance in the g1g3 double mutant. Wait, in this model, if the 10% in g1g3 comes from G2 activity, but when G2 is knocked out, it's 0%. Then combining g1g3 with g2 (the triple mutant) would be 0%, which they couldn't test here. But in the data provided, the double mutants are only up to two knocked out.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a hierarchy. Let's imagine a linear pathway: G1 -> G3 -> G2. If the pathway is G1 activates G3, which activates G2. Then, if you knock out G1, then G3 and G2 are not activated, leading to the same phenotype as G2 (0% resistance). But in reality, g1 is 75%. So that's incompatible. Alternatively, the pathway is reversed: G2 -> G1 -> G3. Then knocking out G2 would block the entire pathway, resulting in 0% resistance. Knocking out G1 would prevent activation of G3, so resistance would be lower. But according to the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, suggesting they function in separate pathways. Alternatively, maybe G2 is involved in the main pathway, and G1 and G3 are part of a secondary pathway.

This is getting complicated. Let's look at the key points again:

- If we consider that when you knock out G2, resistance is completely gone (0%). All double mutants involving G2 are also 0%. So any combination with G2 being out results in 0%. This suggests that G2 is crucial, and its loss cannot be compensated by the others.

- Meanwhile, the double mutant g1g3 has a resistance lower than either single mutant. So maybe G1 and G3 work in a separate pathway that, when both are lost, causes a more severe phenotype. But since their double mutant isn't 0%, but 10%, there's a tiny bit of resistance left. This could suggest that the pathway involving G2 contributes that remaining 10%, but in the presence of a functional G2.

Wait, wait. Let's clarify:

If in the g1g3 double mutant, G2 is still functional, since they only knocked out G1 and G3. In that case, g1g3 should still have G2 active, but according to the data, their resistance is 10%. So if G2 is active in the g1g3 plant, but they have 10% resistance whereas in wild type it's 100%, and in g2 it's 0%, this could indicate that G1 and G3 are part of a pathway that enhances G2's function. So in the absence of G1 and G3, G2's ability to confer resistance is only 10%, but normally, G1 and G3 boost it to 100%. Alternatively, maybe there are two pathways: one is independent G2 (which when active, gives some resistance but not full), and another pathway involving G1 and G3, which contribute additively. But when all three are wild type, the total resistance is the sum. But when you knock out G1 and G3, only G2's pathway is active, but it's not enough (only 10%). Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the G2 pathway can confer some basal resistance (e.g., 10%), and the G1/G3 pathway adds the remaining 90%. But if G2 is knocked out (0%), then even if G1 and G3 are functional, they can't contribute anything, which doesn't fit because then in the wild type, you'd have 10% + 90% = 100%. But if that's the case, the G1/G3 pathway depends entirely on G2. So knocking out G2 would nullify the G1/G3 pathway, leading to 0%. However, when you knock out G1 and G3, you still have the 10% from G2, hence g1g3 is 10%. But then when you knock out G2 (which is the source of that 10%), the double mutants with G2 (g1g2, g2g3) would combine to give 0%, which they do. And the g1g3 is 10%, which is from remaining G2 activity. This seems to fit.

So, in that model, G2 is a transcription factor that controls a basal pathway (10% resistance), and G1 and G3 are part of a different pathway (possibly activated by G2) that contributes 90% of resistance. Let me see:

Wild type: G2 is active (10%) + G1 and G3 pathway (90%) → 100%.

g2 mutant: Can't contribute the 10%, and G1/G3 pathway also not active (since maybe they are downstream) → 0%.

But wait, in this model, the g1 and g3 mutants would have 10% plus part of the 90%:

g1 mutant: G2 active (10%) + G3 part of the pathway. But since G1 is out, the  G1/G3 pathway is only 50% effective? So 10% + 50% = 60%, but the data says g1 is 75%. Hmm, discrepancy. So this might not be it.

Alternatively, G2 is a transcription factor required for the activation of either G1 or G3. Suppose G2 is required for G1 expression, and G1 is required for G3 expression. Then, in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Then, g2 mutant is 0%. g1 mutant would have no G1, but G3 is still expressed (since G1 is downstream). Wait, but if G1 is required for G3, then in g1 mutant, G3 is not expressed. Then g3 mutant also is 50%, which is less than g1 (0% maybe)? This is getting too convoluted.

Given the initial assumption from the problem that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of the others, so there must be some hierarchy. The key is that knocking out a gene upstream would cause the downstream genes to not function.

If, for example, G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Then, in a g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. However, if in reality, knocking out G2 alone gives 0%, but when G1 and G3 are individually knocked out, their mutants have higher resistance (75% and 50%). So that suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in pathways that do not require G2, or that G2 has a role separate from activating them.

Alternatively, maybe the TF (say G2) is not the sole activator. Like, there might be other TFs. But according to the problem, at least one of the three is a TF upstream of others.

I think the answer might be that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3. Here's why:

- When G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0% (all double mutants with G2 are also 0%).

- The genes G1 and G3 when individually knocked out have higher resistance (75% and 50%), suggesting that they may function downstream of G2.

The double mutant g1g3 has lower resistance than either single mutant (10%), which suggests that when both downstream genes are inactive, they can't compensate for each other. However, even with both G1 and G3 inactive, there's a small residual resistance (10%), which might be some other pathway, but that's not considered here.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that are both activated by G2. So G2 being a TF that activates both pathways: one through G1 and another through G3. In that case, knocking out G2 silences both, hence 0%. Knocking out G1 leaves the G3 pathway active (so resistance is 50% + some?), but why would g3's resistance be 50% and g1 be 75%? If G1's pathway contributes more than G3's. Like, G1 pathway contributes 75% and G3's 25%, so when either is knocked out, you have the other remaining.

Sorry, but let me organize this better.

If G2 is the upstream TF that activates both G1 and G3. Then, G1 and G3 each are part of separate pathways contributing to resistance. Let's say:

Wild type: 100% resistance comes from the sum of G1 pathway (75%) and G3 pathway (25%). So, if G1 is knocked out, you have 25% left (but in the data, g1's resistance is 75%). That contradicts. So maybe split differently. Alternatively, the pathways are overlapping.

Alternatively, there's partial compensation between G1 and G3. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out one might only partially reduce resistance. For instance, if they both contribute 50% each, but there's partial overlap. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, it's epistatic. Let's suppose that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. That would mean that G2's function is downstream. But the way to tell is that if you have a double mutant between G2 and either G1 or G3, the phenotype is the same as G2. Which is the case here. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 have the same resistance (0%) as g2. Which would suggest that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. When a gene is epistatic, it's downstream. So, epistasis implies that the downstream gene's mutation masks the effect of the upstream gene. So if G2 is downstream, then mutations in G2 will hide the effects of G1 and G3, because their products are upstream and their function requires G2 to be functioning. Thus, the double mutants would look like G2. Hence, the data fits this. Therefore, G2 is downstream of G1 and G3.

So the conclusion is that G1 and G3 act in a pathway that converges on G2. Therefore, G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3. But wait, the problem states that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So if G2 is downstream, the upstream ones would be G1 and/or G3, which are not necessarily TFs. But then the transcription factor must be upstream. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor, acting downstream, but how can that be? A transcription factor is usually upstream in regulatory terms. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, (epistatic also can refer to gene order in a pathway). For example, let’s say a biochemical pathway: Gene A produces an enzyme that creates substrate for Gene B. If you knockout Gene A (upstream), Gene B can't function because there's no substrate. So the phenotype of A and the double mutant AB would both be the same as Gene A alone. Hence, Gene A is epistatic to Gene B. So epistatic mutations mask the phenotype of downstream mutations.

In this case, G2 mutations are epistatic to G1 and G3; hence, G2 is downstream. But if G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it's downstream in the regulatory pathway. For example, G1 and G3 induce the expression of G2, which then activates defense genes. Therefore, if G2 is not present (g2 mutant), it doesn't matter if G1 or G3 are functional, since G2 can't relay the signal. Hence, the double mutants are same as g2—epistatic. So G2 is downstream. But G2 is a transcription factor, which would then activate other genes.

Hence, in this model:

G1 → signals to → G3 → which activates → G2 (TF) → activates defense genes → resistance.

But perhaps, but the data would require G1 and G3 mutations to be upstream.

Alternatively, G2 is a TF that is activated by both G1 and G3. Thus, the output (resistance) depends on G2. If G2 is non-functional, resistance is zero, regardless of G1 and G3 status. If G2 is functional, then G1 and G3 influence the level of resistance (as their mutants reduce resistance by 25% and 50% respectively). The double mutant g1g3 would have both G1 and G3 defects, leading to less activation of G2, hence lower resistance (10%).

This seems possible. If G2 is functional in all cases except when it's mutated, then:

- Wild type: G1 and G3 activate G2 fully → 100% resistance.

- g1 mutant: G3 can still activate G2 partially →75%.

- g3 mutant: G1 activates G2, but only up to 50% of normal.

- g1g3 mutant: Minimal activation of G2 →10%.

- g2 mutant: G2 is not functional →0%.

This fits the data. Therefore, G2 is the transcription factor downstream of G1 and G3, integrating their signals and activating resistance pathways. So the transcription factor is G2, acting downstream. But TFs are typically upstream in regulatory pathways. Hmm. But in this case, G1 and G3 could be signaling components that activate the TF G2. For example, G1 and G3 might be kinases or receptors that signal to G2, which then activates gene expression.

This seems possible. Therefore, the interaction is that G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3. So the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor required for resistance, and it is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning that G1 and G3 act upstream of G2 to regulate its activity.

But if the downstream gene is mutated (since upstream requires the pathway to function), then possibly if g2 is upstream, a knockout would block the entire pathway. But when we see that g2 alone already has no resistance (0%), adding mutations in g1 or g3 doesn\'t make it worse. However, when g1 and g3 are both mutated (double mutant g1g3), the resistance drops to 10%, but impacting, but combine with g2 to stay at 0%. If g2 was upstream, then any mutation downstream (g1 and/or g3) might not affect the phenotype worse than g2. However, in this case, even the g1g3 mutant isn\'t at 0% but at 10%, which suggests that maybe there\'s residual pathway activity when g2 is functional. But get stuck here.\n\nWait, perhaps need to model it as a linear pathway. Suppose the genes follow a hierarchy. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 would not be expressed. Therefore, the g2 mutant would have the same resistance as the double mutant g1g3.

However, 0.75 * 0.5 = 37.5%, but reality is 10%, suggesting they function synergistically. But epistatic interactions could complicate this. Since their combined effect is more severe, this could mean they are in parallel pathways contributing to resistance. If they were part of different pathways, then disrupting both might lead to a compounded effect. That\'s the case here. Therefore, G1 and G3 may function in separate, additive pathways. Hence, the combined loss reduces resistance even more.\n\nSince g2 has 0% on its own. So even if G2 is in a third pathway. However, when you inactivate g2 in combination with g1 or g3, the resistance remains 0%, which can\'t be worse. This supports the idea that G2 is acting in a pathway that\'s critical for resistance, while G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through other pathways. But if G2 is 0%, adding mutations in G1 or G3 wouldn\'t reduce resistance further, but perhaps their double mutants (g1g3) show cumulative effects. The fact that adding g2 to g1 or g3 doesn\'t lower resistance beyond 0% suggests that the pathways controlled by G2 are the main contributors.\n\nBut the key here is the upstream transcription factor. The question states that at least one of these is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, perhaps G2 is this TF. If G2 acts upstream, such that g2 mutants disable resistance entirely (0%), and the downstream genes like G1 and G3 would be regulated by G2. Therefore, if G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes can\'t be expressed, hence their single knockouts (g1 and g3) have partial resistance (maybe other pathways providing residual resistance). But how?\n\nAlternatively, if the transcription factor is G1, then g1 mutants would disrupt the pathway, but in reality, g1 only reduces resistance to 75%, which is a smaller effect. Similarly, if G3 was the TF, then g3 has 50% resistance, which is worse than g1, but the double mutants might indicate differently.\n\nWait, maybe the transcription factor is G2, and it\'s a negative regulator. But if it\'s a negative regulator, then the knockout (g2) would lead to higher resistance, but the results show lower resistance (0%), contradicting that idea. So if G2 acts as a positive regulator (supporting resistance), then losing G2 results in 0% resistance, meaning G2\'s role is critical. If it acts upstream of others, mutants of G2 would prevent activation of G1 and G3, so the resistance in g1 or g3 mutants would still be less impactful. But the actual data shows that g1 and g3 single mutants are not as severe as g2. For example, if G2 is required to activate G1 and G3, then a g2 mutant would have both G1 and G3 inactive, so the resistance would be equivalent to the g1g3 double mutant. However, the g2 mutant is 0% and the g1g3 is 10%, which doesn\'t align. This suggests that G2\'s role is perhaps in a separate pathway.\n\nAlternatively, can the transcription factor be redundant? For example, if two TFs are present, but the question states that at least one is such. Alternatively, maybe G2\'s function is separate, but the combination suggests that G1 and G3 are in a pathway initiated by another factor.\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Let\'s reiterate the possible epistatic relationships.\n\nGene g2, when knocked out, leads to 0% resistance and is epistatic to both g1 and g3. But the double mutants of g1 and g3 (g1g3) exhibit 10% resistance, which is lower than either single mutation and suggests that their pathways are additive.\n\nThe key point is that loss of G2 entirely disrupts the resistance, so G2 is possibly the main gene required for resistance. Since G2\'s phenotype is most severe, and other single mutants (g1, g3) have partial resistance, their genes must function in pathways that contribute to resistance but are not entirely dependent on G2. However, when G2 is lost, these pathways may not function at all. If G2 is a transcription factor required for the expression of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would result in both G1 and G3 not being expressed. However, in that scenario, the g1 and g3 mutants would still have their own phenotypes, but in reality, if G2 is required for their expression, then their knockouts wouldn\'t matter. For example, if G2 isn\'t there, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. Therefore, the g2 mutation would remove all G1 and G3 activity, and the resistance would be 0%. But then the individual g1 and g3 mutants shouldn\'t have resistance reduced as much because either gene might be partially functional even without G2. However, according to the data, when G1 alone is knocked out, resistance is 75% - this suggests that the other genes (G2 and G3) are still active. So, if G2 is a TF needed for G1 and G3 expression, and we knock out G1, the remaining G2 and G3 would still contribute to resistance. So why would g1 have 75% resistance? That could make sense. Similarly, for g3, with 50% resistance, maybe G2 and G1 can compensate. But then, in a g2 mutant, since G2 is a TF required to activate G1 and G3, the absence of G2 would mean both G1 and G3 aren\'t expressed, leading to full susceptibility. But in the experiments, g2g3 double mutant is 0%, same as g2, but g1g3 is 10% resistance (which is lower than g1 or g3 single mutants). Hmm, confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates other genes, but also works in parallel with G1 and G3. Maybe G2 is upstream of G1 and another pathway involving G3. \n\nAlternatively, think of the following scenario: G2 is an upstream transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Then, in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, so the plant has no resistance (0%). If only G1 is knocked out, then G2 is still active and can upregulate G3, giving partial resistance (50%, which is actually less than the wild type which has 100%?), wait no. Wait, if wild-type is 100%, perhaps the presence of all three genes gives full resistance, and the mutants compromise that. But in that case, model becomes complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each gene contributes additively. If the wild-type has 100%, maybe each gene\'s contribution adds up. Losing one gene would reduce resistance proportionally. However, the single mutants reduce resistance by varying degrees.\n\nAlternatively, the triple mutant would be worse. But since the triple mutant\'s data isn\'t given, we can\'t confirm. But maybe the question is about gene hierarchy based on the double mutants.\n\nAnother angle is using the "masking" concept. For example: If g1g3 double mutant shows 10%, but if G1 were upstream of G3, then knocking out G1 would mask the effect of G3 (because G1 is necessary for G3 function). Thus, the G1 mutation would result in the same resistance as g1g3. But here, g1 is 75%, and G1G3 is 10%, meaning their combined effect is more than additive, implying they function in separate pathways. Similarly, if G3 were upstream, then the effect would be the same. But since they are additive, separate pathways.\n\nThe critical point is the double mutants\' resistance. For example:\n\n- When g1 and g2 are knocked out (g1g2), resistance is 0%.\n- When g2 and g3 are knocked out (g2g3), also 0%.\n- When g1 and g3 are knocked out (g1g3), 10%.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n- Since the g2 mutation is more severe than g1 or g3 alone, combining g2 with any other mutation doesn\'t change resistance (still 0%).\n- Combining g1 and g3 gives a lower resistance than either alone, meaning together their combined loss impacts more resistance. So their effects are additive, hence separate pathways.\n- Since the g2 mutation is epistatic (any double mutant with g2 has 0% resistance), we can consider that g2 is on a essential pathway.\n\nGiven that the question states that one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others.\n\nIn such a case, likely g2 is that transcription factor. Because if g2 is upstream, its mutation would disable downstream genes. However, downstream gene loss (e.g., G1 and G3) would contribute individually but not fully to the resistance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 is the upstream gene. Let\'s test this.\n\nIf G1 is upstream:\n\n- Mutant g1 has 75% resistance. The presence of G2 and G3 might compensate partially for the loss of G1, but further knocking out G3 (g1g3) causes 10% resistance. But if G1 is upstream activating G3, then in the g1 mutant, G3 would not be active (meaning g1 mutant already has inactive G3). Therefore, the double mutant g1g3 would have same phenotype as g1. But here, g1g3 is 10% vs. g1 75%. Hence, this model is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if G3 is upstream:\n\n- If G3 is upstream of G1 and/or G2. The double mutants don\'t support this.\n\nAlternatively, since combining g1g3 gives severe effect, G1 and G3 may be in separate pathways. Suppose G2 is in another pathway, and the presence of these three allows resistance. But this doesn\'t directly relate to the transcription factor\'s requirement.\n\nLooking back—since G2\'s mutants have the most severe phenotype (0%), if G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream targets. Then, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 would not function. If this is true, then resistance would entirely depend on G2. However, in reality, g1 and g3\'s individual mutants have partial resistance. So this suggests that when G2 is knocked out, other factors besides G1 and G3 still contribute some resistance. Alternatively, maybe G2 is not solely responsible for the activation of G1 and G3.\n\nAlternatively, the transcription factor (say G2) works in parallel with G1 and G3. For example, the resistance pathway has two components: one dependent on G2 and others on G1/G3. If G2 is a transcription factor regulating non-coding RNAs or other modulators instead, then the other double mutants could act differently.\n\nAlternatively, it\'s about redundancy: perhaps there are multiple TFs. However, the question states at least.\n\nAfter all, given that the transcription factor operates upstream, the key is to find a case where one gene\'s mutation masks the effects of others. The only case where this occurs is with G2 and any of the others, since when G2 is mutated, any combinations don\'t lower resistance further (remains 0%). This suggests G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. In the hierarchy, G2 is downstream. Because in a pathway where G2 is downstream of G1 and G3, a mutation in G2 (which renders the pathway non-functional) would mask the effect of mutations in upstream genes. However, if G2 is upstream, a mutation in G2 would prevent downstream G1 and G3 from acting. But given the data, the double mutants with G2 show the same phenotype as G2 alone, so possibly G2 is epistatic (downstream). \n\nThe rule is: when a mutation in a downstream gene (which the pathway proceeds through) leads to the same phenotype as a mutation in an upstream gene, meaning the downstream mutation is epistatic. For example, if gene A is upstream and activates gene B, then mutation in A (which stops the signal) can\'t be rescued by B being functional. Therefore, mutations in A and A and B (double mutant) would have the same phenotype. The same principle here: if G2 is downstream, a mutation in G2 would result in loss of resistance regardless of upstream genes (G1 and G3). Hence, the resistance of g1g2 and g2g3 would resemble the g2 single mutant.\n\nHowever, according to the data, all double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) have 0% resistance. But the mutation in g2 alone already causes 0% resistance, so adding another mutation does not alter it. Therefore, G2\'s mutation is epistatic to G1 and G3. This suggests G2 acts downstream of both G1 and G3 in the resistance pathway. In other words, G1 and G3 act upstream to regulate G2; when G2 is absent, disabling G1 or G3 makes no difference because the pathway\'s downstream component (G2) is already non-functional.\n\nBut that\'s contradictory with the question stating that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. If G2 is downstream, but the transcription factor must be upstream, this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, if G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3. If that were the case, then knocking out G2 (the TF) would negate the expression of G1 and G3. Hence, resistance would be worse (0%), but how do the individual knockouts (g1, g3) impact it?\n\nScenario: G2 is the TF that turns on G1 and G3. So in wild-type plants, G2 activates G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out (g2 mutant), then both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Thus, the plant will have no resistance (0%). If G1 is knocked out, but G2 is functional, then G3 may still be active. Hence, the g1 mutant still have 75% resistance. Similarly, g3 mutant would retain some resistance via G1, which is 50%. Combining g1g3 and g2 mutants have the same as g2. \n\nHowever, in the data, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. But in the model where G2, the TF, activates G1 and G3, then a missing G1 would mean its contribution to resistance is missing, but perhaps the plant can compensate with other pathways. Similarly for G3. \n\nWait, if G2 activates alternative response pathways independently of G1 and G3, or in addition, then the TF\'s role would only be part of the entire resistance mechanism. Alternatively, if G2 is necessary for the activation of G1 and G3, but there are other targets of G2 that contribute to resistance. For example, G2 independently affects gene X, which also contributes to resistance. Then, in g2 mutants, none of these are upregulated, leading to 0% resistance. In g1 mutants, G2 is active, so can upregulate G3 and other targets (like gene X), hence there is partial resistance (75%).\n\nThen, double mutant g1g3 -- if G2 is still active, but both G1 and G3 are absent, resistance might be lower than either single mutant (since G2 can upregulate gene X and other factors, but without G1 and G3). Then resistance might be lower than either single mutant. Which aligns with the given data where g1g3 is 10%, more susceptible than single mutants.\n\nFurthermore, the model supports that G2 is upstream, functioning as the TF activating multiple components (G1, G3, and others). Thus, when G2 is non-functional, even if other genes are present, their activity isn\'t initiated, leading to no resistance. When G1 or G3 are knocked out, G2 can activate the others and any additional pathways. \n\nIn this scenario, the conclusion would be that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of both G1 and G3, and potentially other genes involved in resistance. The mutant g2 has no resistance because none of the downstream genes (G1, G3, etc.) are activated. Meanwhile, individual knockouts of G1 or G3 reduce resistance to the extent allowed by remaining genes. The double mutant of G1 and G3 (g1g3) has very low resistance (10%) because only other components (possibly controlled by G2\'s other targets) provide minimal resistance.\n\nHence, the hierarchy is that G2 is the upstream transcription factor necessary for activating G1 and G3 as well as other genes contributing to anthracnose resistance. Thus, when G2 is absent, all pathways dependent on it are shut down, leading to complete susceptibility. Meanwhile, individual loss of G1 or G3 impairs the resistance but leaves some functionality through the other gene and any additional factors triggered by G2.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744976040, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4483, prompt_tokens=1227, total_tokens=5710, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

From the experimental data and analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn about the interaction between G1, G2, and G3 in conferring anthracnose resistance in white lupine:

1. **G2 is the upstream transcription factor**:  
   - The severe phenotype of the *g2* mutant (0% resistance) indicates that **G2 is essential for resistance** and likely acts upstream as a transcription factor regulating downstream genes, including G1 and G3.  
   - When G2 is non-functional (knocked out), even functional copies of G1 or G3 cannot compensate, implying G2 is required to activate these downstream genes.  

2. **Epistatic relationship**:  
   - All double mutants involving *g2* (*g1g2*, *g2g3*) show 0% resistance, identical to the *g2* single mutant. This indicates **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**, meaning their functions depend on G2 being active.  
   - G1 and G3 contribute partially to resistance but operate in pathways regulated by G2.  

3. **G1 and G3 act in parallel pathways**:  
   - The *g1g3* double mutant (10% resistance) shows a synergistic effect compared to individual *g1* (75%) and *g3* (50%) mutants, indicating their roles are additive. This suggests **G1 and G3 function in independent pathways**, both contributing to resistance but not fully overlapping.  

4. **Hierarchy of gene interaction**:  
   G2 (transcription factor) → activates/modulates → G1 and G3 → contribute additively to resistance.  
   - G2 is critical for initiating resistance pathways.  
   - Loss of G1 or G3 reduces resistance partially, but loss of both (*g1g3*) amplifies susceptibility.  

**Conclusion**:  
**G2 acts as the master transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3**, which function in parallel pathways. G2 is indispensable for activating these downstream genes, and its loss renders plants fully susceptible. G1 and G3 contribute redundantly but partially to resistance, explaining the additive effect in the *g1g3* double mutant.

Alternatively, as a possible transcription factor upstream.

Wait, but normally, if A is epistatic to B, a mutation in A masks B's phenotype. But if the downstream gene is mutated (since upstream requires the pathway to function), then possibly if g2 is upstream, a knockout would block the entire pathway. But when we see that g2 alone already has no resistance (0%), adding mutations in g1 or g3 doesn't make it worse. However, when g1 and g3 are both mutated (double mutant g1g3), the resistance drops to 10%, but impacting, but combine with g2 to stay at 0%. If g2 was upstream, then any mutation downstream (g1 and/or g3) might not affect the phenotype worse than g2. However, in this case, even the g1g3 mutant isn't at 0% but at 10%, which suggests that maybe there's residual pathway activity when g2 is functional. But get stuck here.

Wait, perhaps need to model it as a linear pathway. Suppose the genes follow a hierarchy. If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 would not be expressed. Therefore, the g2 mutant would have the same resistance as the double mutant g1g3. But in the data, g2 has 0% resistance, while g1g3 has 10% resistance, which would not fit. Therefore, that model may not hold.

Alternatively, maybe the wild-type genes G2 is functioning as an inhibitor of resistance. However, the mutants have lower resistance, so if G2 is a negative regulator (knocking out G2 would increase resistance). Since g2 has 0% resistance, which is worse, this might not make sense. Thus, excluded.

Another approach: let's think about additive effects. Since g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, their combination might be expected to be lower, perhaps multiplicative? However, 0.75 * 0.5 = 37.5%, but reality is 10%, suggesting they function synergistically. But epistatic interactions could complicate this. Since their combined effect is more severe, this could mean they are in parallel pathways contributing to resistance. If they were part of different pathways, then disrupting both might lead to a compounded effect. That's the case here. Therefore, G1 and G3 may function in separate, additive pathways. Hence, the combined loss reduces resistance even more.

Since g2 has 0% on its own. So even if G2 is in a third pathway. However, when you inactivate g2 in combination with g1 or g3, the resistance remains 0%, which can't be worse. This supports the idea that G2 is acting in a pathway that's critical for resistance, while G1 and G3 contribute to resistance through other pathways. But if G2 is 0%, adding mutations in G1 or G3 wouldn't reduce resistance further, but perhaps their double mutants (g1g3) show cumulative effects. The fact that adding g2 to g1 or g3 doesn't lower resistance beyond 0% suggests that the pathways controlled by G2 are the main contributors.

But the key here is the upstream transcription factor. The question states that at least one of these is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, perhaps G2 is this TF. If G2 acts upstream, such that g2 mutants disable resistance entirely (0%), and the downstream genes like G1 and G3 would be regulated by G2. Therefore, if G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes can't be expressed, hence their single knockouts (g1 and g3) have partial resistance (maybe other pathways providing residual resistance). But how?

Alternatively, if the transcription factor is G1, then g1 mutants would disrupt the pathway, but in reality, g1 only reduces resistance to 75%, which is a smaller effect. Similarly, if G3 was the TF, then g3 has 50% resistance, which is worse than g1, but the double mutants might indicate differently.

Wait, maybe the transcription factor is G2, and it's a negative regulator. But if it's a negative regulator, then the knockout (g2) would lead to higher resistance, but the results show lower resistance (0%), contradicting that idea. So if G2 acts as a positive regulator (supporting resistance), then losing G2 results in 0% resistance, meaning G2's role is critical. If it acts upstream of others, mutants of G2 would prevent activation of G1 and G3, so the resistance in g1 or g3 mutants would still be less impactful. But the actual data shows that g1 and g3 single mutants are not as severe as g2. For example, if G2 is required to activate G1 and G3, then a g2 mutant would have both G1 and G3 inactive, so the resistance would be equivalent to the g1g3 double mutant. However, the g2 mutant is 0% and the g1g3 is 10%, which doesn't align. This suggests that G2's role is perhaps in a separate pathway.

Alternatively, can the transcription factor be redundant? For example, if two TFs are present, but the question states that at least one is such. Alternatively, maybe G2's function is separate, but the combination suggests that G1 and G3 are in a pathway initiated by another factor.

Hmm, this is getting complex. Let's reiterate the possible epistatic relationships.

Gene g2, when knocked out, leads to 0% resistance and is epistatic to both g1 and g3. But the double mutants of g1 and g3 (g1g3) exhibit 10% resistance, which is lower than either single mutation and suggests that their pathways are additive.

The key point is that loss of G2 entirely disrupts the resistance, so G2 is possibly the main gene required for resistance. Since G2's phenotype is most severe, and other single mutants (g1, g3) have partial resistance, their genes must function in pathways that contribute to resistance but are not entirely dependent on G2. However, when G2 is lost, these pathways may not function at all. If G2 is a transcription factor required for the expression of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would result in both G1 and G3 not being expressed. However, in that scenario, the g1 and g3 mutants would still have their own phenotypes, but in reality, if G2 is required for their expression, then their knockouts wouldn't matter. For example, if G2 isn't there, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. Therefore, the g2 mutation would remove all G1 and G3 activity, and the resistance would be 0%. But then the individual g1 and g3 mutants shouldn't have resistance reduced as much because either gene might be partially functional even without G2. However, according to the data, when G1 alone is knocked out, resistance is 75% - this suggests that the other genes (G2 and G3) are still active. So, if G2 is a TF needed for G1 and G3 expression, and we knock out G1, the remaining G2 and G3 would still contribute to resistance. So why would g1 have 75% resistance? That could make sense. Similarly, for g3, with 50% resistance, maybe G2 and G1 can compensate. But then, in a g2 mutant, since G2 is a TF required to activate G1 and G3, the absence of G2 would mean both G1 and G3 aren't expressed, leading to full susceptibility. But in the experiments, g2g3 double mutant is 0%, same as g2, but g1g3 is 10% resistance (which is lower than g1 or g3 single mutants). Hmm, confusing.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates other genes, but also works in parallel with G1 and G3. Maybe G2 is upstream of G1 and another pathway involving G3. 

Alternatively, think of the following scenario: G2 is an upstream transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Then, in the g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, so the plant has no resistance (0%). If only G1 is knocked out, then G2 is still active and can upregulate G3, giving partial resistance (50%, which is actually less than the wild type which has 100%?), wait no. Wait, if wild-type is 100%, perhaps the presence of all three genes gives full resistance, and the mutants compromise that. But in that case, model becomes complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each gene contributes additively. If the wild-type has 100%, maybe each gene's contribution adds up. Losing one gene would reduce resistance proportionally. However, the single mutants reduce resistance by varying degrees.

Alternatively, the triple mutant would be worse. But since the triple mutant's data isn't given, we can't confirm. But maybe the question is about gene hierarchy based on the double mutants.

Another angle is using the "masking" concept. For example: If g1g3 double mutant shows 10%, but if G1 were upstream of G3, then knocking out G1 would mask the effect of G3 (because G1 is necessary for G3 function). Thus, the G1 mutation would result in the same resistance as g1g3. But here, g1 is 75%, and G1G3 is 10%, meaning their combined effect is more than additive, implying they function in separate pathways. Similarly, if G3 were upstream, then the effect would be the same. But since they are additive, separate pathways.

The critical point is the double mutants' resistance. For example:

- When g1 and g2 are knocked out (g1g2), resistance is 0%.
- When g2 and g3 are knocked out (g2g3), also 0%.
- When g1 and g3 are knocked out (g1g3), 10%.

Which implies:

- Since the g2 mutation is more severe than g1 or g3 alone, combining g2 with any other mutation doesn't change resistance (still 0%).
- Combining g1 and g3 gives a lower resistance than either alone, meaning together their combined loss impacts more resistance. So their effects are additive, hence separate pathways.
- Since the g2 mutation is epistatic (any double mutant with g2 has 0% resistance), we can consider that g2 is on a essential pathway.

Given that the question states that one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others.

In such a case, likely g2 is that transcription factor. Because if g2 is upstream, its mutation would disable downstream genes. However, downstream gene loss (e.g., G1 and G3) would contribute individually but not fully to the resistance.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is the upstream gene. Let's test this.

If G1 is upstream:

- Mutant g1 has 75% resistance. The presence of G2 and G3 might compensate partially for the loss of G1, but further knocking out G3 (g1g3) causes 10% resistance. But if G1 is upstream activating G3, then in the g1 mutant, G3 would not be active (meaning g1 mutant already has inactive G3). Therefore, the double mutant g1g3 would have same phenotype as g1. But here, g1g3 is 10% vs. g1 75%. Hence, this model is invalid.

Similarly, if G3 is upstream:

- If G3 is upstream of G1 and/or G2. The double mutants don't support this.

Alternatively, since combining g1g3 gives severe effect, G1 and G3 may be in separate pathways. Suppose G2 is in another pathway, and the presence of these three allows resistance. But this doesn't directly relate to the transcription factor's requirement.

Looking back—since G2's mutants have the most severe phenotype (0%), if G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream targets. Then, in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 would not function. If this is true, then resistance would entirely depend on G2. However, in reality, g1 and g3's individual mutants have partial resistance. So this suggests that when G2 is knocked out, other factors besides G1 and G3 still contribute some resistance. Alternatively, maybe G2 is not solely responsible for the activation of G1 and G3.

Alternatively, the transcription factor (say G2) works in parallel with G1 and G3. For example, the resistance pathway has two components: one dependent on G2 and others on G1/G3. If G2 is a transcription factor regulating non-coding RNAs or other modulators instead, then the other double mutants could act differently.

Alternatively, it's about redundancy: perhaps there are multiple TFs. However, the question states at least.

After all, given that the transcription factor operates upstream, the key is to find a case where one gene's mutation masks the effects of others. The only case where this occurs is with G2 and any of the others, since when G2 is mutated, any combinations don't lower resistance further (remains 0%). This suggests G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. In the hierarchy, G2 is downstream. Because in a pathway where G2 is downstream of G1 and G3, a mutation in G2 (which renders the pathway non-functional) would mask the effect of mutations in upstream genes. However, if G2 is upstream, a mutation in G2 would prevent downstream G1 and G3 from acting. But given the data, the double mutants with G2 show the same phenotype as G2 alone, so possibly G2 is epistatic (downstream). 

The rule is: when a mutation in a downstream gene (which the pathway proceeds through) leads to the same phenotype as a mutation in an upstream gene, meaning the downstream mutation is epistatic. For example, if gene A is upstream and activates gene B, then mutation in A (which stops the signal) can't be rescued by B being functional. Therefore, mutations in A and A and B (double mutant) would have the same phenotype. The same principle here: if G2 is downstream, a mutation in G2 would result in loss of resistance regardless of upstream genes (G1 and G3). Hence, the resistance of g1g2 and g2g3 would resemble the g2 single mutant.

However, according to the data, all double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) have 0% resistance. But the mutation in g2 alone already causes 0% resistance, so adding another mutation does not alter it. Therefore, G2's mutation is epistatic to G1 and G3. This suggests G2 acts downstream of both G1 and G3 in the resistance pathway. In other words, G1 and G3 act upstream to regulate G2; when G2 is absent, disabling G1 or G3 makes no difference because the pathway's downstream component (G2) is already non-functional.

But that's contradictory with the question stating that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. If G2 is downstream, but the transcription factor must be upstream, this might not fit.

Alternatively, if G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream of G1 and G3. If that were the case, then knocking out G2 (the TF) would negate the expression of G1 and G3. Hence, resistance would be worse (0%), but how do the individual knockouts (g1, g3) impact it?

Scenario: G2 is the TF that turns on G1 and G3. So in wild-type plants, G2 activates G1 and G3. If G2 is knocked out (g2 mutant), then both G1 and G3 are not expressed. Thus, the plant will have no resistance (0%). If G1 is knocked out, but G2 is functional, then G3 may still be active. Hence, the g1 mutant still have 75% resistance. Similarly, g3 mutant would retain some resistance via G1, which is 50%. Combining g1g3 and g2 mutants have the same as g2. 

However, in the data, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. But in the model where G2, the TF, activates G1 and G3, then a missing G1 would mean its contribution to resistance is missing, but perhaps the plant can compensate with other pathways. Similarly for G3. 

Wait, if G2 activates alternative response pathways independently of G1 and G3, or in addition, then the TF's role would only be part of the entire resistance mechanism. Alternatively, if G2 is necessary for the activation of G1 and G3, but there are other targets of G2 that contribute to resistance. For example, G2 independently affects gene X, which also contributes to resistance. Then, in g2 mutants, none of these are upregulated, leading to 0% resistance. In g1 mutants, G2 is active, so can upregulate G3 and other targets (like gene X), hence there is partial resistance (75%).

Then, double mutant g1g3 -- if G2 is still active, but both G1 and G3 are absent, resistance might be lower than either single mutant (since G2 can upregulate gene X and other factors, but without G1 and G3). Then resistance might be lower than either single mutant. Which aligns with the given data where g1g3 is 10%, more susceptible than single mutants.

Furthermore, the model supports that G2 is upstream, functioning as the TF activating multiple components (G1, G3, and others). Thus, when G2 is non-functional, even if other genes are present, their activity isn't initiated, leading to no resistance. When G1 or G3 are knocked out, G2 can activate the others and any additional pathways. 

In this scenario, the conclusion would be that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of both G1 and G3, and potentially other genes involved in resistance. The mutant g2 has no resistance because none of the downstream genes (G1, G3, etc.) are activated. Meanwhile, individual knockouts of G1 or G3 reduce resistance to the extent allowed by remaining genes. The double mutant of G1 and G3 (g1g3) has very low resistance (10%) because only other components (possibly controlled by G2's other targets) provide minimal resistance.

Hence, the hierarchy is that G2 is the upstream transcription factor necessary for activating G1 and G3 as well as other genes contributing to anthracnose resistance. Thus, when G2 is absent, all pathways dependent on it are shut down, leading to complete susceptibility. Meanwhile, individual loss of G1 or G3 impairs the resistance but leaves some functionality through the other gene and any additional factors triggered by G2.
