# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty (or linewidth) of each state is given by \(\Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}\).

1. **Calculate the linewidth for each state:**
   - For the state with lifetime \(\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \ \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \ \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \ \text{eV} = 0.658 \ \mu\text{eV}
     \]
   - For the state with lifetime \(\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \ \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \ \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \ \text{eV} = 0.0658 \ \mu\text{eV}
     \]

2. **Sum the linewidths to find the total uncertainty:**
   \[
   \Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 = 0.658 \ \mu\text{eV} + 0.0658 \ \mu\text{eV} \approx 0.724 \ \mu\text{eV}
   \]

3. **Determine the energy difference required:**
   To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than the combined linewidth. Therefore, the energy difference \(\Delta E\) should be greater than \(0.724 \ \mu\text{eV}\).

Given typical options, the closest value greater than \(0.724 \ \mu\text{eV}\) would be \(1 \ \mu\text{eV}\).

\[
\boxed{10^{-6}\ \text{eV}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. So the problem is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to figure out the energy difference between them that would allow us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The question gives options, but they're not listed here. Hmm, maybe I need to recall how energy levels' lifetimes relate to their energy uncertainties. 

Right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle connects the lifetime of a state (Δτ) with the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) through the relation ΔE * Δτ ≈ ħ/2. But wait, is it ħ or ħ-bar? Oh yeah, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. So the uncertainty in energy is about ħ divided by twice the lifetime. Let me make sure. The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δτ). So each energy level has an inherent uncertainty due to their finite lifetime. To resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference ΔE_total should be larger than the combined uncertainty from both levels. 

So, first, I should calculate the energy uncertainty for each state. For the state with lifetime τ1 = 10^-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 = ħ / (2τ1). Similarly, for τ2 = 10^-8 seconds, ΔE2 = ħ / (2τ2). Then the total uncertainty might be the sum of these two uncertainties? Or maybe the square root of the sum of squares? Hmm, that's sometimes how uncertainties add. Let me think. If the uncertainties are independent, they add in quadrature. But since we need the total linewidth, I think they sum the full widths. Wait, the problem says "clearly distinguish", which usually means that the separation between the peaks should be greater than the sum of their widths. In spectroscopy, the Rayleigh criterion might be analogous— where two peaks are resolvable if their separation is greater than the sum of their half-widths? Wait, maybe the full width at half maximum (FWHM). Let me confirm: the energy uncertainty is related to the lifetime; specifically, the FWHM is Γ = ħ / τ. So Γ1 = ħ / τ1, and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. The natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ / τ. Then the total linewidth when considering both states would be the sum Γ1 + Γ2? Because each state's energy has an uncertainty, the transition between them would have a linewidth that's the sum. Then, according to the uncertainty principle, the energy difference between the two states must be larger than their combined linewidth to be resolvable. So the energy difference ΔE should satisfy ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2? Or is it ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2?

Wait, let's step back. The linewidth from each energy level contributes to the uncertainty in the transition frequency. If we have two energy levels, each with a certain linewidth, the total linewidth of the transition would be the sum of the individual linewidths. So if Γ1 is the linewidth (FWHM) of E1 and Γ2 of E2, then the transition linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, to resolve the two energy levels, the energy separation ΔE must be greater than the linewidth of the transition. So ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2). But then some resources say that two spectral lines are resolvable if their separation is greater than their average linewidth. For example, the Rayleigh criterion in optics states that two peaks are resolved if their separation is greater than the FWHM. But that is for diffraction; maybe it's different here. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, you can resolve them. The general idea is that if the energy levels are too close compared to their uncertainties, they overlap and can't be distinguished. The condition for being resolvable is usually that the difference in energy is greater than the sum of the uncertainties. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Where ΔE1 and ΔE2 are the uncertainties in each energy level? Let me check.

Using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). So for τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9). Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8). Thus, the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because the uncertainties add when you subtract two quantities. Therefore, ΔE_total_uncertainty = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )? Wait, or is it sum? Let me recall error propagation. If you have two variables, x and y, with uncertainties Δx and Δy, then the uncertainty in their difference Δ(x - y) is sqrt( (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 ). So then maybe the total uncertainty in the energy difference is sqrt( (ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ). Then, to resolve the energy levels, the actual energy difference E2 - E1 must be greater than this total uncertainty. 

But wait, this might vary depending on the criterion used. For example, some might use the sum rather than the quadrature sum. However, in error analysis, if the uncertainties are independent, which they are here (the lifetimes are independent), then the uncertainties add in quadrature. So maybe that's the correct approach here. 

Therefore, energy difference needed is prime Delta E > sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). 

But there's another angle. If the natural linewidth (FWHM) is given by Γ = ħ / τ. Then, a state with lifetime τ1 has Γ1 = ħ / τ1, and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. For transitions between these states, the linewidth would be the sum Γ1 + Γ2 because both states contribute to the uncertainty in the transition frequency. Therefore, if the energy difference is much larger than the linewidth, you can resolve the transition. So according to this definition, the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of Γ1 and Γ2?

Wait, but in that case, the natural linewidth for each state is Γ = ħ / τ. Therefore, Γ1 = ħ / τ1, Γ2 = ħ / τ2.

If the transition line is between two states each with linewidths Γ1 and Γ2, then the overall linewidth would be Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2. Because the uncertainties from both states contribute additively to the width of the spectral line. Then, according to the Rayleigh criterion, the peaks are resolvable if their separation is greater than their widths. So, if you have two peaks at energies E and E', their difference ΔE = |E - E'| must be greater than Γ_total to be resolvable. 

Therefore, yes, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the sum of the individual linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2). Therefore, in this problem, we calculate Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2, sum them, and set ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2. 

Alternatively, sometimes people use the full width at half maximum (FWHM) where the linewidth of each state is Γ = ħ / τ; therefore, the combined linewidth is indeed Γ1 + Γ2.

So let's proceed with that approach.

First, compute Γ1 and Γ2. Then sum them. The energy difference has to be larger than this value. 

Given τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s.

Convert τ1 from seconds to reciprocal angular frequency? Wait, energy in terms of E = ħω, so Γ (FWHM) is equal to ħ / τ, as the linewidth. So Γ1 = ħ / τ1, and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Hence, when sum them, Γ_total = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Therefore, ΔE must be > Γ_total.

Solving for ΔE, ΔE > ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Plugging numbers, τ1=1e-9 s, τ2=1e-8 s. Let me compute Γ_total.

Γ_total = ħ (1e9 + 1e8) 1/s.

Compute 1e9 + 1e8 = 1.1e9 1/s

Therefore, Γ_total = ħ * 1.1e9 1/s

But to get the energy difference in Joules, we multiply by ħ. Let me compute that numerical value.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Thus, Γ_total = 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1.1e9 1/s = 1.16...e-25 J.

But the problem asks for the answer in terms of energy. However, commonly, in such contexts, energies are expressed in electron volts (eV). So we might need to convert from Joules to eV. 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

Thus, Γ_total in eV is 1.16e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.25e-7 eV ≈ 0.725 µeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the choices are given in terms that would relate to this calculation. So if for example, the energy difference must be larger than Γ_total. Therefore, if the options provided include something larger than ~0.7 µeV, that might be the answer.

But wait, wait, let me compute this again.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.055e-34 Js.

Thus Γ1 = ħ/τ1 = (1.055e-34 Js)/(1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J.

Similarly, Γ2 = ħ/τ2 = (1.055e-34 Js)/(1e-8 s) = 1.055e-26 J.

Therefore, the sum of Γ1 and Γ2 is 1.055e-25 + 1.055e-26 = (10 +1 ) * 1.055e-26 = 11.605e-26 J ≈ 1.16e-25 J.

Convert that to eV: 1.16e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.25e-7 eV ≈ 0.725 µeV.

But here's a thought: is this the linewidth or the uncertainty in energy? If the task is to distinguish the two energy levels, the energy separation must be much larger than the sum of their uncertainties. For the uncertainty principle, it's ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Hence, for each level, the uncertainty in energy is: ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1), ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2). So then the total uncertainty when you have two levels is, as per uncertainty propagation, sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2). However, wait, when you measure the difference between two energies that each have an uncertainty, the total uncertainty in the difference is sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2). Therefore, to resolve the energy difference, the actual difference must be greater than this combined uncertainty. Therefore, that would be:

ΔE_required > sqrt[(ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ].

Which is different from our previous calculation. Hmm. So here, this seems like a better approach because we are dealing with two independent uncertainties, and when you take the difference between two variables (E2 - E1), the uncertainty is the quadrature sum. Therefore, we can compute this.

So let's compute this. First, ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) ≈ (1.055e-34 Js)/(2*1e-9 s) ≈ 5.275e-26 J.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2)= (1.055e-34)/(2e-8) ≈ 5.275e-27 J.

Then sqrt( (5.275e-26)^2 + (5.275e-27)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 2.78e-51 + 2.78e-54 ) ≈ sqrt( ~2.78e-51 ) ≈ 5.275e-26 J.

Wait, because 5.275e-27 squared is 2.78e-54, which is much smaller than 2.78e-51, so the sqrt will be dominated by the first term. Therefore, it's approximately 5.275e-26 J. Which is ΔE1. Then ΔE_required is approximately 5.275e-26 J. Convert that to eV. 5.275e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 0.329 µeV.

But that's if you use the quadrature sum. However, prior approach gives around 0.7 µeV if you think of linewidths as summing. So which is correct? I need to think.

Alternatively, perhaps in spectroscopy, the linewidth of a transition between two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2 is given by Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 = (ħ / τ1 ) + ( ħ / τ2 ). Because each state contributes a linewidth. Thus, the total linewidth is the sum. So ΔE needs to be greater than this Γ for the peaks to be resolved.

Given this, Γ1 = 1e-34 / 1e-9=1.055e-25 J and Γ2 =1.055e-34 /1e-8=1.055e-26 J. Thus, total Γ = 1.055e-25 + 1.055e-26 = 1.16e-25 J as above, which is ~0.725 µeV. But if I use the combined uncertainty in the difference, which gives me ~0.329 µeV, then which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the detectable resolution requires the separation to be greater than the linewidth. If linewidth is 0.7 µeV, separation must be greater than that. But sometimes, the criterion is separation greater than half the linewidth. Hmm, Rayleigh criterion for spectral lines is if two lines are separated by the FWHM, then they are considered resolvable. So if the energy difference ΔE is equal to Γ (FWHM), then the peaks are just resolved.

So according to that, ΔE needs to be of order Γ.

Wait, but in our case, Γ is the linewidth. So if the natural linewidth is Γ, then for two peaks separated by less than Γ, they would overlap. Therefore, in order to resolve them, the separation ΔE should be greater than Γ. Thus, the answer would be ΔE > Γ = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2 ), so ~0.7 µeV. Hence, to clearly resolve them, the energy difference should be larger than this.

Alternatively, the criterion might be ΔE > ħ / τ where τ is the shorter lifetime due to the larger uncertainty. Wait, if τ1 is shorter (1e-9) has larger Γ1. So Γ1 dominates. So the dominant uncertainty comes from the shorter lifetime. Therefore, in this case, maybe considering Γ1 (which is 0.659 µeV) and Γ2 (0.0659 µeV--approximate numbers). Then sum is ~0.725 µeV. So energy difference must be larger than this.

But maybe the options are given in those terms.

Alternatively, the user hasn't given the options. The question is in Chinese, but the user just copied the problem and they just write "please reason step by step..."

But the original problem says: "Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?"

Hmm. The possible answers are missing, but perhaps we can compute the required energy difference using the above reasoning and compare it with standard options if the user is expecting a numerical answer.

Alternatively, the fact that natural linewidth Γ is given by the inverse lifetime multiplied by ħ. Therefore, probably ΔE must be greater than Γ1 + Γ2. With τ1=1e-9 and τ2=1e-8, Γ1= ħ /1e-9= 1.06e-25 J and Γ2=1.06e-26 J. Sum is ~1.167e-25 J, which is approximately 7.28e-7 eV (~0.73 µeV).

Therefore, the required energy difference should be substantially larger than 0.73 µeV. Among typical options, perhaps 1 meV (which is 1000 µeV) would be sufficient, as it's several orders larger. Alternatively, 1 eV would be way larger, but perhaps intermediate values might be in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps calculate the minimal ΔE required and pick the first value exceeding it. If there's an option around 1 µeV, that would do; but depends on the options.

Alternatively, perhaps another angle. When do two spectral lines become resolvable? The resolution condition is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2, where ΔE1 and ΔE2 are uncertainties. If you use the uncertainty principle as ΔE ∼ ħ/Δt, then using τ1 and τ2 for each state. Then, Γ1 ≈ ħ/(τ1) as the natural linewidth. Thus ΔE needs to be greater than Γ1 + Γ2. So exactly the same result as before.

Therefore, the minimum energy difference required is  Γ1 + Γ2 ≈0.73 µeV, so selecting an energy difference bigger than 0.73 µeV would resolve the two levels.

Possible options might be 1 µeV, 10 µeV, etc.

If the options include something like 1e-6 eV (1 µeV), which is about 1.6e-25 J, which is higher than our calculated ~1.16e-25 J. Hence, 1 µeV would be sufficient to resolve.

Alternatively, if the possible option is 1e-5 eV (0.01 meV), which is 10 µeV, which is way bigger. Wait, but since even at 1 µeV is sufficient, perhaps answer is around that range.

But common units used here are meV and µeV.

I need to check atomic energy scales to see typical values. For example, thermal energy at room temperature is about 25 meV. So energy levels with µ eV differences are very closely spaced. But if the problem is saying "clearly resolved", they need to specify using which technique. But maybe based purely on lifetime broadening.

Therefore, unless given options, the calculated value is approximately 0.7 µeV, so any answer greater than that would resolve the levels.

Alternatively, if computed via the quadrature method sqrt( (0.659 µeV)^2 + (0.0659 µeV)^2 ) ≈ ~0.663 µeV. Hmm, little different. But again, depends on error propagation. Since the ΔE is evaluated for the energy difference E2-E1, once again, the uncertainty in that difference is the square root of the sum of the squares. But some sources might state that to resolve, the separation should be larger certain multiple of the uncertainty. For Gaussian profiles, I think that two peaks separated by more than their standard deviation can be resolved, but FWHM is perhaps larger. Alternatively, let me recall the resolution criteria.

The Rayleigh resolution criterion states that two peaks are resolved when the peak separation is equal to the FWHM of the peaks. So in that case, if each peak has a given linewidth (FWHM is Γ), then their separation should be equal to Γ for Rayleigh criterion. Hence, energy difference should be greater than Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 here. So the consideration with the linewidth sum seems better.

Alternatively, though, if each state has uncertainty in its energy, then maybe the combined uncertainty should be considered, but if we consider the problem of determining the absolute energies, the precision with which you can measure each energy is Γ1 and Γ2. But when you measure transition frequencies between the two states, the linewidth would be the sum.

In any case, given these confusions, but textbook linewidths for transitions add to each other. Searching google, for example, the linewidth of a transition is the sum of the linewidths of the upper and lower states.

Hence, energy difference ΔE must be greater than h_bar*(1/τ1 + 1/τ2), approximates the linewidth (as ħ is used, or h?) Wait, good point. Let's double-check line-broadening formulas. In natural broadening, the linewidth (FWHM) for a transition from state |a> to |b> is Γ = Γ_a + Γ_b where Γ_a is the inverse of the lifetime of state a, Γ_b is the inverse of the lifetime of state b. However, expressed in angular frequency Γ_ω = Γ_a + Γ_b. Then converting to energy Γ_E = ħΓ_ω = ħ(Γ_a + Γ_b). So this would be Γ_E = ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Therefore, the linewidth in energy is not just  Γ = ħ / τ, but combined Γ_total = ħ ( 1 / τ1 + 1 / τ2 ) Hence, this is the same as before.

Therefore, to clearly resolve the energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in the transition from that linewidth. Therefore, ΔE > Γ_total. Hence, our calculations before hold. So given that Γ_total ≈0.7 µeV.

Therefore, the answer must be greater than ~0.7 µeV. Now, if we look at standard answers, let's assume that the options are:.

A) 10^-6 eV (1 µeV)

B) 10^-7 eV (0.1 µeV)

C) 10^-8 eV (0.01 µeV)

D) 10^-9 eV (0.001 µeV)

Then, the correct answer would be A) 1e-6 eV.

Alternatively, could the answer be ħ/(2*1e-9) + hbar/(2*1e-8) ~ (5.27e-26 +5.27e-27) J ~ approx 5.8e-26 J which is around 0.36 µeV. Then ΔE must be greater than 0.36 µeV. Then even 1e-6 eV (1 µeV) which is 1e-6 eV = 1000 times larger than n eV (0.36 µeV is 0.36e-6 eV). So even 1 µeV is 3 times bigger, so clearly resolvable. So answer would then be depends on which method.

Either way, seems like the answer would be on the order of µeV. So given problem options, probably 1e-6 eV. If the options are given but user hasn't included them, but instructed assistant to write in Chinese. But according to user's English instructions here, he copied the problem. Wait here maybe thought the options are labeled in Chinese characters, but the assistant can write the answer. The original quiz may have options like given in EN here, but well. Despite missing options, from our analysis, energy difference must be greater than 0.7 µeV or so, hence answer is or BE larger than that.

But in this context, accepting multiple choice options, typically the desired answer is calculated via combined linewidths. Therefore, answer is \( \Delta E > \hbar (\frac{1}{\tau_1} + \frac{1}{\tau_2}) \). So plugging numbers ħ is about 6.582×10^-16 eV·s.

Yes, another approach: convert time to energy using ħ values.

Lifetime τ is given, we can calculated the energy uncertainty as Γ = ħ / τ.

Given ħ = 6.582×10^-16 eV·s.

Thus, for τ1 = 1e-9 s:

Γ1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV = ~0.658 µeV.

Similarly, Γ2 = 6.582e-16 /1e-8 =6.582e-8 eV=0.0658 µeV.

Thus totalΓ = 0.658 +0.0658 ≈0.724 μeV.

Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than ~0.724 µeV. Hence, possible answer wouldneed to be > 0.724 µeV, so the next higher option, which is 1 µeV, if such is present.

Thus, final answer is approximately 1 μeV. Therefore, boxed answer would be \boxed{10^{-6}\ \text{eV}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{10^{-6}\ \text{eV}}

Okay, let's see. So the problem is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to figure out the energy difference between them that would allow us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The question gives options, but they're not listed here.

Thus, the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because the uncertainties add when you subtract two quantities. Therefore, ΔE_total_uncertainty = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )? Wait, or is it sum? Let me recall error propagation. If you have two variables, x and y, with uncertainties Δx and Δy, then the uncertainty in their difference Δ(x - y) is sqrt( (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 ). So then maybe the total uncertainty in the energy difference is sqrt( (ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ). Then, to resolve the energy levels, the actual energy difference E2 - E1 must be greater than this total uncertainty. 

But wait, this might vary depending on the criterion used. For example, some might use the sum rather than the quadrature sum. However, in error analysis, if the uncertainties are independent, which they are here (the lifetimes are independent), then the uncertainties add in quadrature. So maybe that's the correct approach here.

# Anthropic completion

Let me examine this problem concerning two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, having lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. I need to determine the energy difference that would allow these two levels to be clearly distinguishable.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle connects a state's lifetime (Δτ) with its energy uncertainty (ΔE) through the relation ΔE * Δτ ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s). This means the uncertainty in energy is roughly ħ divided by twice the lifetime.

For the first state with lifetime τ1 = 10^-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, for the second state with τ2 = 10^-8 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2).

To clearly distinguish two energy levels, their separation needs to exceed the combined uncertainty from both levels. In spectroscopy, each energy level contributes to the linewidth of a transition. The natural linewidth is given by Γ = ħ/τ, representing the full width at half maximum (FWHM).

Therefore, Γ1 = ħ/τ1 for the first state and Γ2 = ħ/τ2 for the second. The total linewidth of the transition would be the sum of these individual linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2). To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than this combined linewidth.

Alternatively, using error propagation principles, since the uncertainties in the energy levels are independent (as the lifetimes are independent), the total uncertainty in their difference might be calculated as the square root of the sum of squares: sqrt((ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2). Then, to resolve the energy levels, the actual energy difference E2 - E1 must exceed this total uncertainty.

The appropriate criterion might depend on the specific context, but generally, the energy levels are resolvable if their difference exceeds their combined uncertainty.

Alright, let's take a look. We're dealing with two quantum states having energies E1 and E2, with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We're tasked with determining the energy difference that would allow us to distinguish these two levels. Although the question provides multiple-choice options, they aren't included here. I need to remember how energy levels' lifetimes relate to their energy uncertainties.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle ties the lifetime (Δτ) of a state to the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), using the relation ΔE * Δτ ≈ ħ/2, where ħ represents the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. This implies that the energy uncertainty is about ħ divided by twice the lifetime. Specifically, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δτ). Thus, each energy level has an inherent uncertainty due to its finite lifetime. To resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference ΔE_total should exceed the combined uncertainty from both levels.

First, calculate the energy uncertainty for each state: for the state with lifetime τ1 = 10^-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 = ħ / (2τ1). Similarly, for τ2 = 10^-8 seconds, ΔE2 = ħ / (2τ2). The total uncertainty can be the sum of these uncertainties, or possibly the square root of the sum of squares, depending on how uncertainties add. If independent, they add in quadrature, but to resolve the two levels, their separation must exceed the sum of their linewidths. In spectroscopy, the Rayleigh criterion might apply—two peaks are resolved if their separation is greater than their combined half-widths. The natural linewidth, given by Γ = ħ / τ, figures into this: Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Thus, the total linewidth considering both states is Γ1 + Γ2. The energy difference ΔE must be greater than their combined linewidth for them to be resolvable.

Stepping back, if Γ1 and Γ2 are the linewidths of E1 and E2, the transition's total linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, to resolve the levels, ΔE should be greater than Γ1 + Γ2. Some references suggest the energy levels are resolvable if their separation surpasses the average linewidth. If the energy difference notably exceeds the uncertainty, the levels are distinguishable. The condition for resolvability is that the energy difference surpasses the sum of uncertainties. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2, with ΔE1 and ΔE2 representing uncertainties at each level.

Applying Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). For τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9). Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8). Hence, the total uncertainty in energy difference is the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2 or sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), based on error analysis. Typically, independent uncertainties add in quadrature, which likely applies here. Consequently, the energy difference must be greater than this total uncertainty for the levels to be resolved.

Then, the transition between the two levels would have a linewidth of Γ1 + Γ2. Because when you have a transition from a higher energy state with lifetime τ1 and a lower one with τ2, the total decay rate is related to both. Hmm, this might depend on the context. But for energy levels, the natural linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ for each level. Therefore, if you have a transition from a state with lifetime τ_upper to τ_lower, the linewidth of the transition is Γ_upper + Γ_lower. So then the FWHM of the spectral line is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2.\n\nThus, to resolve the energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the FWHM, so ΔE > Γ = Γ1 + Γ2.\n\nSo in that case, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than (ħ/τ1 + ħ/τ2).\n\nTherefore, ΔE > ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Let\'s calculate that.\n\nFirst, let\'s compute 1/τ1 + 1/τ2.\n\nGiven τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s.\n\n1/τ1 = 1e9 s^-1, 1/τ2 = 1e8 s^-1. So 1e9 + 1e8 = 1.1e9 s^-1.\n\nMultiply by ħ, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.\n\nSo the total linewidth Γ_total = ħ*(1.1e9) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 * 1.1e9 ≈ 1.16e-25 J.\n\nBut the question is about energy difference; maybe we can convert this to electron volts (eV) since energy levels are usually discussed in eV.\n\n1 J = 6.242e18 eV. So 1.16e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 7.26e-7 eV ≈ 0.726 microelectron volts (μeV).\n\nBut let me verify calculation:\n\n1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1.1e9 s^-1 = 1.0545718e-34 * 1.1e9 = 1.16e-25 J. Then converting that to eV: 1.16e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.25e-7 eV = 0.725 μeV.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Γ = ħ / τ for each state, then add them.\n\nΓ1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J\n\nΓ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J\n\nThen Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J, same as before. So in eV, ~0.725 μeV.\n\nThus, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.73 μeV to be resolvable. If the options are in this range, that would be the answer. However, the question might expect us to take the uncertainty as the minimum energy difference. But let\'s see what\'s standard. In spectroscopy, the resolving power often uses the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two peaks are resolvable if their separation is at least equal to their linewidth. However, that applies to the full width at half maximum. If the linewidths of the two peaks are Γ1 and Γ2, then the separation must be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2 to resolve them according to the Rayleigh criterion, but maybe the exact factor depends on the lineshape. For Lorentzian line shapes, which are typical for natural linewidths, the criterion might be different because they have broader tails. \n\nAlternatively, if you suppose that each energy level\'s uncertainty is ΔE = ħ/(2τ), as per Heisenberg, then the uncertainty in each energy is ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1), ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2). Then, the total uncertainty when taking the difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), which would be sqrt( (ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ). Then, if you want the actual energy difference to be greater than this uncertainty, that\'s the condition for resolvability.\n\nCalculating that:\n\nsqrt( ( (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) )^2 + ( (1.05e-34) / (2e-8) )^2 ) = (1.05e-34 / 2) * sqrt( 1 / (1e-9)^2 + 1 / (1e-8)^2 ) \n\n= (5.27e-35) * sqrt(1e18 + 1e16) \n\n= 5.27e-35 * sqrt(1.01e18) ≈ 5.27e-35 * 1.005e9 \n\n≈ 5.27e-35 * 1.005e9 ≈ 5.3e-26 J\n\nConvert to eV: 5.3e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.3e-7 eV ≈ 0.33 μeV\n\nHmm, so depending on how we combine uncertainties, the required energy difference is either ~0.33 μeV (quadrature) or ~0.73 μeV (sum of linewidths). Since the linewidths being summed gives a larger value, maybe the correct answer is the more stringent condition. But which approach is right?\n\nMaybe another way: for each energy level, the width in energy is Γ = ħ / τ. So transition linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2 (since the upper state can decay, and the lower state can also decay, affecting the uncertainty in the transition energy). Therefore, energy difference must be at least a few times the transition linewidth. Perhaps the standard criteria is energy difference > (Γ1 + Γ2). Hence, probably in that case, 0.73 μeV.\n\nBut some contexts specify resolution requires ΔE ≈ (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. Or, typical resolution might be around that.\n\nHowever, the problem says "clearly distinguish". This is probably in the same spirit as the Rayleigh criterion where the separation should be greater than the linewidth. For example, in the case of a transition between two states each with linewidth Γ1 and Γ2, the natural linewidth of the transition is Γ1 + Γ2. Then, to "clearly distinguish" two such transitions, their separation needs to be greater than the linewidth. Therefore, the energy difference ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.\n\nTherefore, we can compute Γ1 and Γ2 as ħ / τ1 and ħ / τ2. Thus:\n\nΓ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J\n\nΓ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J\n\nΓ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 1.16e-25 J ≈ 0.725 μeV\n\nThus, the energy difference needs to be greater than approximately 0.725 μeV. So if the options are in that vicinity, for example, 1 μeV, that could be an answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question provides options like:\n\nA) 10^-8 eV\n\nB) 10^-6 eV\n\nC) 10^-4 eV\n\nD) 10^-2 eV\n\nIn such a case, 10^-6 eV is 1 μeV, which is close to our calculation of 0.7 μeV, so would be the correct choice. Alternatively, since the actual value is ~7e-7 eV, if an option is 10^-6 eV (1 μeV), which is an order of magnitude higher, that is sufficient.\n\nWait, but ΔE should be greater than Γ_total, which is ~0.7 μeV. So if the energy difference is 1 μeV, which is larger than 0.7, then they can be resolved. If another option is 0.1 μeV, which is smaller, then they can\'t. So depending on the options, the answer would be the one exceeding ~0.7 μeV.\n\nBut since I don\'t have the actual options, but the user is asking which of the following could be their energy difference. Given that the calculated required minimum energy difference is on the order of 1e-6 eV (μeV), the energy difference should be at least around that.\n\nBut maybe the answer is expressed in terms of ħ and lifetime. Let\'s check with numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the student to compute the Heisenberg uncertainty for each energy level and take the sum. Or recognize that both energy levels have some width, so the minimum separation should be greater than the sum of their widths.\n\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2*τ). For τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2e-9). For τ2=1e-8, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2e-8). So the sum of uncertainties: ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2e-9) + ħ/(2e-8) = ħ/2 (1e9 + 1e8) = ħ/2 * 1.1e9 ≈ (1.05e-34)/2 * 1.1e9 ≈ 5.25e-26 * 1.1e9 ≈ wait, wait: no. 1.05e-34 divided by 2 is ~5.25e-35, multiplied by 1.1e9 is 5.25e-35 * 1.1e9 = ~5.775e-26 J. Then converting to eV: 5.775e-26 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ~3.61e-7 eV ~0.36 micro eV. \n\nBut earlier calculation with the sum of Γ1 and Γ2 gave ~0.7 μeV. Hmm, so here using half of linewidth. Wait, confusion between ΔE being Γ/2 or Γ.\n\nIn the energy-time uncertainty principle, the relation is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, where Δt is the lifetime. So, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). But in the context of natural linewidth, the linewidth Γ is equal to ΔE = ħ / Δt. So perhaps here we have different definitions.\n\nWait, someone might compute ΔE as Γ (FWHM) being equal to ħ / τ. Then the FWHM is given by ΔE = ħ / τ, so Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2. Then the combined linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). So in this case, Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.05e-34 J·s * (1e9 + 1e8) s^-1 = 1.05e-34 * 1.1e9 ≈ 1.155e-25 J, which is as before ~0.725 μeV.\n\nAlternatively, if someone uses the standard deviation ΔE instead of Γ. Then ΔE = Γ/2. Because for a Lorentzian distribution, the FWHM is 2ΔE, but sometimes conventions vary.\n\nThis seems a point of confusion. Let me check a reference. \n\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle for energy and time is often stated as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. But in the context of natural linewidth, the relation Γ * τ ≈ ħ, but from a more precise calculation, the linewidth is Γ = ħ / τ. Because the lifetime τ is related to the decay rate Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. So inherently if the decay rate is Γ, the lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Therefore, the linewidth Γ is given by Γ = ħ / τ.\n\nThus, for each state, Γ1 = ħ / τ1, Γ2 = ħ / τ2. So Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2) = ħ (1e9 + 1e8) = 1.1e9 ħ.\n\nBut converting to energy:\n\nΓ_total = 1.1e9 * 1.05e-34 J·s * 1/s = 1.155e-25 J, which is ~0.72 μeV.\n\nTherefore, if the energy difference is sufficiently larger than this, they can be resolved. The answer likely is around this value.\n\nBut the problem is from an exam, probably with given choices, but since it\'s not given, I need to box the approximate value. However, looking at the calculation, possible units errors.\n\nWait, what\'s 1 eV in terms of Joules? 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. Therefore, converting Γ_total from Joules to eV:\n\n1.155e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.21e-7 eV ≈ 0.721 μeV.\n\nSo the energy difference should be significantly larger than 0.72 μeV. But what options does the question give? Maybe let me think what option matches - 1 μeV is 1e-6 eV. Then it\'s bigger than 0.72 μeV, so yes. If the options include 1e-6 eV, that\'s plausible. Otherwise, if the options include 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01 μeV, that\'s much smaller. The factor of ten might matter here. So, maybe 1e-6 eV (option B) is right, while 1e-8 eV (option A) is too small. Since the user mentions the lifetime of the states and asks for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, and the calculated minimum is approximately 0.7 μeV, the answer would be an energy difference greater than this. Such as 1 μeV. So probably the option around 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) would be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{10^{-6} \\, \\text{eV}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744975779, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3885, prompt_tokens=1267, total_tokens=5152, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) and lifetimes \( 10^{-9} \) seconds and \( 10^{-8} \) seconds respectively, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state is given by \( \Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau} \).

1. Calculate the natural linewidth for each state:
   - For the state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - For the state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. Convert the linewidths to electron volts (eV):
   - \( 1 \, \text{J} = 6.242 \times 10^{18} \, \text{eV} \)
   - \( \Gamma_1 \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \times 6.242 \times 10^{18} \, \text{eV/J} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \)
   - \( \Gamma_2 \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \times 6.242 \times 10^{18} \, \text{eV/J} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)

3. Sum the linewidths to find the total linewidth:
   \[
   \Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \approx 0.725 \, \mu\text{eV}
   \]

To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than the total linewidth. The closest value greater than \( 0.725 \, \mu\text{eV} \) is \( 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \).

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

ores, required energy difference ΔE > sqrt( (ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ). 

But maybe the actual linewidths are Γ = ħ/τ, and thus the linewidth of each energy level is Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2. Then, the transition between the two levels would have a linewidth of Γ1 + Γ2. Because when you have a transition from a higher energy state with lifetime τ1 and a lower one with τ2, the total decay rate is related to both. Hmm, this might depend on the context. But for energy levels, the natural linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ for each level. Therefore, if you have a transition from a state with lifetime τ_upper to τ_lower, the linewidth of the transition is Γ_upper + Γ_lower. So then the FWHM of the spectral line is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2.

Thus, to resolve the energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the FWHM, so ΔE > Γ = Γ1 + Γ2.

So in that case, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than (ħ/τ1 + ħ/τ2).

Therefore, ΔE > ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Let's calculate that.

First, let's compute 1/τ1 + 1/τ2.

Given τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s.

1/τ1 = 1e9 s^-1, 1/τ2 = 1e8 s^-1. So 1e9 + 1e8 = 1.1e9 s^-1.

Multiply by ħ, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So the total linewidth Γ_total = ħ*(1.1e9) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 * 1.1e9 ≈ 1.16e-25 J.

But the question is about energy difference; maybe we can convert this to electron volts (eV) since energy levels are usually discussed in eV.

1 J = 6.242e18 eV. So 1.16e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 7.26e-7 eV ≈ 0.726 microelectron volts (μeV).

But let me verify calculation:

1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1.1e9 s^-1 = 1.0545718e-34 * 1.1e9 = 1.16e-25 J. Then converting that to eV: 1.16e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.25e-7 eV = 0.725 μeV.

Alternatively, maybe use Γ = ħ / τ for each state, then add them.

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J

Then Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J, same as before. So in eV, ~0.725 μeV.

Thus, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 0.73 μeV to be resolvable. If the options are in this range, that would be the answer. However, the question might expect us to take the uncertainty as the minimum energy difference. But let's see what's standard. In spectroscopy, the resolving power often uses the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two peaks are resolvable if their separation is at least equal to their linewidth. However, that applies to the full width at half maximum. If the linewidths of the two peaks are Γ1 and Γ2, then the separation must be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2 to resolve them according to the Rayleigh criterion, but maybe the exact factor depends on the lineshape. For Lorentzian line shapes, which are typical for natural linewidths, the criterion might be different because they have broader tails. 

Alternatively, if you suppose that each energy level's uncertainty is ΔE = ħ/(2τ), as per Heisenberg, then the uncertainty in each energy is ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1), ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2). Then, the total uncertainty when taking the difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), which would be sqrt( (ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ). Then, if you want the actual energy difference to be greater than this uncertainty, that's the condition for resolvability.

Calculating that:

sqrt( ( (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) )^2 + ( (1.05e-34) / (2e-8) )^2 ) = (1.05e-34 / 2) * sqrt( 1 / (1e-9)^2 + 1 / (1e-8)^2 ) 

= (5.27e-35) * sqrt(1e18 + 1e16) 

= 5.27e-35 * sqrt(1.01e18) ≈ 5.27e-35 * 1.005e9 

≈ 5.27e-35 * 1.005e9 ≈ 5.3e-26 J

Convert to eV: 5.3e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.3e-7 eV ≈ 0.33 μeV

Hmm, so depending on how we combine uncertainties, the required energy difference is either ~0.33 μeV (quadrature) or ~0.73 μeV (sum of linewidths). Since the linewidths being summed gives a larger value, maybe the correct answer is the more stringent condition. But which approach is right?

Maybe another way: for each energy level, the width in energy is Γ = ħ / τ. So transition linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2 (since the upper state can decay, and the lower state can also decay, affecting the uncertainty in the transition energy). Therefore, energy difference must be at least a few times the transition linewidth. Perhaps the standard criteria is energy difference > (Γ1 + Γ2). Hence, probably in that case, 0.73 μeV.

But some contexts specify resolution requires ΔE ≈ (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. Or, typical resolution might be around that.

However, the problem says "clearly distinguish". This is probably in the same spirit as the Rayleigh criterion where the separation should be greater than the linewidth. For example, in the case of a transition between two states each with linewidth Γ1 and Γ2, the natural linewidth of the transition is Γ1 + Γ2. Then, to "clearly distinguish" two such transitions, their separation needs to be greater than the linewidth. Therefore, the energy difference ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.

Therefore, we can compute Γ1 and Γ2 as ħ / τ1 and ħ / τ2. Thus:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J

Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 1.16e-25 J ≈ 0.725 μeV

Thus, the energy difference needs to be greater than approximately 0.725 μeV. So if the options are in that vicinity, for example, 1 μeV, that could be an answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question provides options like:

A) 10^-8 eV

B) 10^-6 eV

C) 10^-4 eV

D) 10^-2 eV

In such a case, 10^-6 eV is 1 μeV, which is close to our calculation of 0.7 μeV, so would be the correct choice. Alternatively, since the actual value is ~7e-7 eV, if an option is 10^-6 eV (1 μeV), which is an order of magnitude higher, that is sufficient.

Wait, but ΔE should be greater than Γ_total, which is ~0.7 μeV. So if the energy difference is 1 μeV, which is larger than 0.7, then they can be resolved. If another option is 0.1 μeV, which is smaller, then they can't. So depending on the options, the answer would be the one exceeding ~0.7 μeV.

But since I don't have the actual options, but the user is asking which of the following could be their energy difference. Given that the calculated required minimum energy difference is on the order of 1e-6 eV (μeV), the energy difference should be at least around that.

But maybe the answer is expressed in terms of ħ and lifetime. Let's check with numbers.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the student to compute the Heisenberg uncertainty for each energy level and take the sum. Or recognize that both energy levels have some width, so the minimum separation should be greater than the sum of their widths.

The Heisenberg uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2*τ). For τ1=1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2e-9). For τ2=1e-8, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2e-8). So the sum of uncertainties: ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2e-9) + ħ/(2e-8) = ħ/2 (1e9 + 1e8) = ħ/2 * 1.1e9 ≈ (1.05e-34)/2 * 1.1e9 ≈ 5.25e-26 * 1.1e9 ≈ wait, wait: no. 1.05e-34 divided by 2 is ~5.25e-35, multiplied by 1.1e9 is 5.25e-35 * 1.1e9 = ~5.775e-26 J. Then converting to eV: 5.775e-26 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ~3.61e-7 eV ~0.36 micro eV. 

But earlier calculation with the sum of Γ1 and Γ2 gave ~0.7 μeV. Hmm, so here using half of linewidth. Wait, confusion between ΔE being Γ/2 or Γ.

In the energy-time uncertainty principle, the relation is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, where Δt is the lifetime. So, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). But in the context of natural linewidth, the linewidth Γ is equal to ΔE = ħ / Δt. So perhaps here we have different definitions.

Wait, someone might compute ΔE as Γ (FWHM) being equal to ħ / τ. Then the FWHM is given by ΔE = ħ / τ, so Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2. Then the combined linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). So in this case, Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.05e-34 J·s * (1e9 + 1e8) s^-1 = 1.05e-34 * 1.1e9 ≈ 1.155e-25 J, which is as before ~0.725 μeV.

Alternatively, if someone uses the standard deviation ΔE instead of Γ. Then ΔE = Γ/2. Because for a Lorentzian distribution, the FWHM is 2ΔE, but sometimes conventions vary.

This seems a point of confusion. Let me check a reference. 

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle for energy and time is often stated as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. But in the context of natural linewidth, the relation Γ * τ ≈ ħ, but from a more precise calculation, the linewidth is Γ = ħ / τ. Because the lifetime τ is related to the decay rate Γ by τ = ħ / Γ. So inherently if the decay rate is Γ, the lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Therefore, the linewidth Γ is given by Γ = ħ / τ.

Thus, for each state, Γ1 = ħ / τ1, Γ2 = ħ / τ2. So Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2) = ħ (1e9 + 1e8) = 1.1e9 ħ.

But converting to energy:

Γ_total = 1.1e9 * 1.05e-34 J·s * 1/s = 1.155e-25 J, which is ~0.72 μeV.

Therefore, if the energy difference is sufficiently larger than this, they can be resolved. The answer likely is around this value.

But the problem is from an exam, probably with given choices, but since it's not given, I need to box the approximate value. However, looking at the calculation, possible units errors.

Wait, what's 1 eV in terms of Joules? 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. Therefore, converting Γ_total from Joules to eV:

1.155e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.21e-7 eV ≈ 0.721 μeV.

So the energy difference should be significantly larger than 0.72 μeV. But what options does the question give? Maybe let me think what option matches - 1 μeV is 1e-6 eV. Then it's bigger than 0.72 μeV, so yes. If the options include 1e-6 eV, that's plausible. Otherwise, if the options include 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01 μeV, that's much smaller. The factor of ten might matter here. So, maybe 1e-6 eV (option B) is right, while 1e-8 eV (option A) is too small. Since the user mentions the lifetime of the states and asks for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, and the calculated minimum is approximately 0.7 μeV, the answer would be an energy difference greater than this. Such as 1 μeV. So probably the option around 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) would be correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}

However, resonance linewidths typically add linearly when considering overlapping distributions. So I think using the sum might be more accurate here.\n\nGiven τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s:\n\nΓ1 = ħ / (1e-9 s) ≈ (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nΓ2 = ħ / (1e-8 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J.\n\nAdding Γ1 and Γ2: 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 ≈ 1.16e-25 J.\n\nBut converting that energy from joules to electron volts (since energies at quantum levels are often expressed in eV) using 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.\n\nΔE (in J) = 1.16e-25 J. Therefore, in eV: 1.16e-25 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 microelectronvolts (μeV).\n\nAlternatively, when using the sum of Γ1 and Γ2 as the necessary energy difference.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the natural linewidth to be the uncertainty in each, then when we determine the energy difference E2 - E1, how does that play?\n\nAnother approach: Each energy level\'s uncertainty contributes to the uncertainty in the transition between them. So the transition frequency\'s uncertainty would be given by linewidths from each state.\n\nThe frequency linewidth Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2, so converting that to energy via E = ħω, so Γ_total (energy) = Γ1 + Γ2. Hence the same conclusion as above: E2 - E1 should be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 to distinguish.\n\nTherefore, if we calculate Γ_total = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/(1e-9 s) + (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/(1e-8 s).\n\nCalculate Γ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J\n\nΓ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J\n\nTotal Γ = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J (as before), ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nSo the energy difference ΔE needs to be greater than about 0.724 μeV to clearly resolve them.\n\nBut let\'s check if perhaps the question is referring to using the energy uncertainty product ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. But since each state has its own ΔE, so how are they combined?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s using ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt), but combining the uncertainties as:\n\nIf we model each energy level\'s uncertainty, the uncertainty in E2 - E1 would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). So:\n\nΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (1.0545718e-34)/(2*1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J\n\nΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) = (1.05e-34 /2e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J\n\nSo the combined uncertainty would be sqrt( (5.27e-26)^2 + (5.27e-27)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2.778e-51 + 2.778e-54) ≈ sqrt(2.78e-51) ≈ 5.27e-26 J\n\nConvert to eV: 5.27e-26 /1.6e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 0.329 μeV\n\nTherefore, if ΔE > 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 0.33 μeV, then perhaps.\n\nBut this would be if the uncertainty in the difference is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using ΔE ≥ combined (ΔE1 + ΔE2) which would be 5.27e-26 + 5.27e-27 = ~5.8e-26 J or ~0.36 μeV.\n\nBut in standard resolution criteria, such as the Rayleigh criterion, for two spectral lines to be resolved, their separation should be greater than the sum of their linewidths. Since in this case each energy level contributes its own linewidth, the combined linewidth of the transition would be Γ1 + Γ2 (because each time you measure a transition, the broadening from each state adds up). So perhaps going back to the ~0.724 μeV as the minimum energy separation required.\n\nSo these are two possible answers depending on approach: 0.33 μeV using uncertainty sum in quadrature, and 0.72 μeV using linewidth sum.\n\nWhich is correct in this context?\n\nIn spectroscopy, when two energy levels are involved in a transition, each with their own natural linewidth, the total linewidth of the transition is indeed the sum of the individual linewidths (Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2). Therefore, the energies can be resolved if their separation is greater than Γ_total. Therefore, the necessary energy difference is Γ1 + Γ2.\n\nExpressed numerically, with τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s:\n\nΓ1 = ħ/τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J\n\nΓ2 = ħ/τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J\n\nSum Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.16e-25 J ≈ 0.724 μeV\n\nThus, to clearly resolve the energy levels, their energy difference should exceed approximately 0.724 μeV. But the problem is given in some multiple-choice options, so perhaps the product may involve options around that value. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, Planck constant: in some contexts, people use h instead of ħ. Wait, need to clarify:\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ or sometimes approximated ΔE Δt ≈ h/(2π)/2, which would be (ΔE * Δt) ≥ ħ/2. So yes, Γ = ħ / τ would be the FWHM linewidth.\n\nAlternatively, natural linewidth is given by Γ = (1/(2π)) * ħ/τ ???\n\nWait, actually in natural linewidth, the relation comes from the Fourier transform of the exponential decay, and the FWHM of the Lorentzian line shape is Γ = ħ/τ.\n\nWait, let me confirm: the fundamental relation comes from the time-energy uncertainty principle. If a state has a mean lifetime τ, then the uncertainty in energy is at least ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). Therefore, the energy uncertainty (FWHM) is Γ = 2ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So yes, Γ = ħ / τ. So Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2, the total linewidth when observing a transition between these two states would be Γ1 + Γ2. Because each state\'s linewidth contributes to the overall linewidth of the transition.\n\nTherefore, the answer would relate to Γ1 + Γ2 converted into energy.\n\nBut possibly the actual question is about just distinguishing the two energy levels, not a transition between them. In such a case, perhaps each energy level has its own uncertainty, so to tell them apart, the separation has to be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties (if considering the worst case), or perhaps the quadrature sum.\n\nFor example, if E1 has uncertainty δE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and E2 has δE2 = ħ/(2τ2), then the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 has uncertainty sqrt( (δE1)^2 + (δE2)^2 ) from propagation of uncertainty.\n\nIn that case, the energy difference would need to be larger than this combined uncertainty to be distinguishable.\n\nTherefore, necessary ΔE > sqrt( (ħ/2τ1)^2 + (ħ/2τ2)^2 ) = ħ/2 * sqrt(1/τ1² + 1/τ2² )\n\nCalculating that:\n\n√(1/(1e-9)^2 + 1/(1e-8)^2) = √(1e18 + 1e16) = √(1.01e18) ≈ 1.005e9 s^-1\n\nThus, ħ/2 * 1.005e9 ≈ (1.0545718e-34 / 2) * 1.005e9 ≈ 5.27e-26 J\n\nConvert this to eV: 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 0.329 μeV\n\nSo this approach leads to a different result. Hence conflicting conclusions. So, alternative reasoning.\n\nThe question is about resolving two energy levels. If each energy level\'s energy is distributed with some uncertainty due to their finite lifetimes, then the uncertainty in their energies would contribute to the difficulty in distinguishing them. If their energy difference is much larger than their individual uncertainties, then they are resolvable.\n\nIn measurement, the criterion for the resolvability of two quantities with uncertainties typically involves the separation being greater than the sum of their uncertainties (like one sigma separation vs. two sigma in statistics). But in other contexts, such as the Rayleigh criterion in optics, the separation needs to be at least the width of the diffraction patterns (usually the sum of half-maximums), which would correspond here to the sum of the linewidths.\n\nTherefore, possibly in this question, when it\'s said to \'clearly distinguish,\' we should use Γ1 + Γ2.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider standard uncertainty addition, it may be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²).\n\nThis discrepancy is central. So where does the difference stem from?\n\nThe linewidth in emission or absorption lines typically is due to the sum of the uncertainties of the two levels involved in the transition. For spontaneous emission, when an electron drops from an upper state to a lower state, the natural linewidth of the transition is given by the sum of the reciprocal lifetimes. Γ_total = Γ_upper + Γ_lower. That is because the transition itself involves the decay rates of both states. Alternatively, if you are measuring just the energy levels (e.g., through some other means), maybe using two separate measurements, the combined uncertainty would be different.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says, "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels." If you are trying to distinguish E1 and E2, maybe from each other\'s perspective, their own energy uncertainty is due to their lifetimes, so each has an uncertainty ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). Then for being able to resolve the difference, assuming E2 > E1, and we have some measurement that can measure these energies. The accuracy of the energy measurement is limited by their uncertainties, so in order to distinguish E1 and E2, the difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the combined uncertainty, which can be considered as the sum or the quadrature sum.\n\nHowever, when combining uncertainties, if they are independent, the total uncertainty is quadrature sum. That is, if you measure E1 with uncertainty ΔE1 and E2 with uncertainty ΔE2, then the uncertainty in the difference is sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2). So, to resolve them clearly, the actual difference must be greater than this uncertainty.\n\nThat would be the standard approach in error analysis, so likely need to use that.\n\nTherefore compute:\n\nΔE = sqrt( (ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ) )\n\nPlugging τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s:\n\nΔE = ħ/2 * sqrt( (1 / τ1^2) + (1 / τ2^2) )\n\nCalculating the sqrt term:\n\nsqrt( (1/(1e-9)^2) + (1/(1e-8)^2) ) = sqrt(1e18 + 1e16) = sqrt(1.01e18) ≈ 1.005e9 s^{-1}\n\nSo,\n\nΔE ≈ (1.0545718e-34 J·s / 2) * 1.005e9 s^{-1}\n\n≈ (5.272859e-35 J·s) * 1.005e9 s^{-1} ≈ 5.299e-26 J\n\nConverting to eV: divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV: 5.299e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.31e-7 eV ≈ 0.331 μeV\n\nAlternatively, they may refer to the full width half max linewidth Γ, which for each state is Γ = ħ / τ. Then the sum of the linewidths Γ1 + Γ2.\n\nΓ1 = ħ / (1e-9) = 1.0545718e-25 J\n\nΓ2 = ħ / (1e-8) = 1.0545718e-26 J\n\nΓ_total = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J = 1.16e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV\n\nThus, if the requirement is that the energy difference should exceed the sum of the linewidths (i.e., Γ_total). The answer would be ~0.72 μeV.\n\nBut this depends on the criterion. Different textbooks/researchers may use different criteria for resolution.\n\nCommonly in spectroscopy, resolving two spectral lines requires that their line profiles don\'t overlap significantly. If each line has a Lorentzian profile with FWHM of Γ1 and Γ2, their separation must be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 to resolve them. If they are separated by more than their combined widths, then they can be distinguished. This approach indeed leads to the sum of the widths.\n\nAlternatively, when dealing with uncertainty in measurements, the uncertainties should be added in quadrature, giving a slightly lower requirement.\n\nBut the question is about clearly distinguishing the two energy levels. So which is intended?\n\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty gives the energy spread (uncertainty) for each energy level as ΔE ~ ħ / τ. So each level\'s energy is "fuzzy" with that spread. Therefore, the two levels would need to be separated by more than the sum of their spreads to be resolvable.\n\nAlternatively, using quadrature sum could be too restrictive or not. For example, in a statistical sense, two Gaussian distributions can be considered resolved if their means are separated by more than the sum of their standard deviations (as a rule of thumb). Although precisely, the resolution criterion differs: the Rayleigh criterion in optics for diffraction-limited resolution requires that the peak of one falls on the first minimum of the other. But in terms of Uncertainty principle broadening.\n\nHere, since the lineshapes are Lorentzian (from exponential decay), which have broader wings than Gaussian. Maybe even 3 times the FWHM to make sure? But perhaps in the problem\'s context, they want the energy difference to be greater than the sum of the individual energy uncertainties (Γ1 + Γ2).\n\nThe problem is probably expecting me to use the energy-time uncertainty principle for each state, calculate their uncertainty (ΔE ≈ ħ / τ), then to resolve them, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2). But some resources might consider adding in quadrature.\n\nWait, But in uncertainty terms, independent uncertainties add in quadrature. So, original question is "clearly distinguish", which in measurement terms likely implies that the separation should be larger than the combined uncertainty (quadrature). However, in spectroscopy, for natural linewidth, the total linewidth is sum, so it\'s added, not quadratically.\n\nGiven that the problem talks about "energy levels" which have lifetimes, so each energy level has a width of Γ = ħ / τ.\n\nThen, when attempting to resolve two energies E1 and E2, each with their own widths, Γ1 and Γ2, the minimal energy difference required for resolution would have to be roughly the maximum of Γ1 and Γ2? Or exceeds the sum? Depends on how they overlap.\n\nIf the energy difference is smaller than the linewidths, obviously they blend. That is, if ΔE < Γ1 and Γ2, they are not resolvable. If ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2, then they can be resolved.\n\nAlternatively, once the energy difference is greater than the sum of the linewidths, you can resolve them. So probably the answer is around ħ*(1/τ1 + 1/τ2) which would be ~1.16e-25 J [0.724 μeV]\n\nBut let\'s calculate that. Given τ1 = 1 ns, τ2 = 10 ns.\n\nΓ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/(1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J = 1.05e-25 J.\n\nΓ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.\n\nSum Γ_total = 1.05e-25 + 1.05e-26 ≈ 1.155e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: as done before, ~0.724 μeV.\n\nBut wait, check another approach. The minimal resolvable energy difference can be determined by the lifetime of the states. The characteristic frequency width is related to the lifetime by Δω ≈ 1/τ for each state. So the frequency difference needed would be Δω >= 1/τ1 + 1/τ2 (for distinguishment). Then converting frequency to energy via ΔE = ħΔω ≈ ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).\n\nThus again, arriving at same value.\n\nThus, references suggest that the linewidth is basically ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. So adding the linewidths (as individual contributions) gives Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than this sum, so in this problem, the answer would be roughly ħ*(1e9 + 1e8) = this is  1.0545718e-34 * 1.1e9 = 1.16e-25 J (0.724 μeV).\n\nAlternatively, let me check if the answer could be, say, obtained via ΔE = h/(2πτ), which for the shorter lifetime would be 10^-9 s: hence ΔE ≈ h/(2π *1e-9), and then requirements for resolution.\n\nWait, yes, but h/2π = ħ. Hence, yes, ΔE = ħ/τ (without factors) here. In earlier I put ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. Hence, the sum linewidth, sum the ΔE1 and ΔE2.\n\nTherefore, it seems the analysis leads to the sum of the linewidths. Now let\'s compare this because in practical terms, for example, if the lifetime is τ = 1e-9 s, the energy uncertainty (FWHM) is Γ ≈ ħ/τ = 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25 J ≈ 0.6 μeV. For τ2=1e-8 s, Γ ≈ 0.06 μeV.\n\nHence, total linewidth 0.6 + 0.06 = 0.66 μeV.\n\nTherefore, if the energy splitting is greater than about 0.7 μeV (approx.), then OK.\n\nLooking at the possible answer options (hypothetically, since the user hasn\'t provided choices but asks to provide the answer), typically such problems gives options like 10^-6 eV, 10^-7 eV, etc.\n\nFrom the options one has to choose, but as the user hasn\'t given the options. The process leads us to either ~0.33 μeV (quadrature sum) or ~0.72 μeV (sum). Given common spectroscopic practice, probably energy difference must exceed sum of the linewidths. Hence, likely the answer is approximately 1e-6 eV or ~1 μeV. However, wait. No, 0.72 μeV is 0.7e-6 eV, so 7e-7 eV.\n\nInterestingly, considering solving for ΔE:\n\nΔE = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2)\n\nCompute it:\n\n1/τ1 + 1/τ2 = 1e9 + 1e8 = 1.1e9 s^{-1}\n\nħ = 1.05e-34 J·s\n\nThen, energy: 1.05e-34 *1.1e9 = 1.155e-25 J\n\nConvert to eV:\n\n1.155e-25 / 1.602e-19 = 7.21e-7 eV ≈ 0.721 μeV\n\nSo 0.721 μeV. \n\nBut if options were steps of powers of 10, maybe 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) would be the immediate step. Or 1e-7.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the answer should depend on the results from the calculation, regardless of the options. So unless the exact answer is needed, which is 0.72 μeV. However, since the user hasn\'t provided options, but asks to write the answer, I should present this calculated value. But the options are missing.

But actually, in the original question in the system, did they have given options? Since now it just says: "Two quantum states... Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" And the user just pastes the problem, but without the options, possibly truncated.\n\nBut given the thought process, the calculated required energy difference is ~0.7 μeV. To clearly resolve the energy levels, their separation needs to be larger than the sum of their individual linewidths. Hence, ħ*(1/τ1 + 1/τ2)=1.05e-34*(1e9 +1e8)=~1.16e-25 J=~0.72 μeV.\n\nExpressed in more precise terms: 0.724 μeV. So states need to be separated by at least that. Hence, possible given that the evaluated result is approximately 0.7 μeV. Hence the energy difference must be greater than this value. Converting to another unit, perhaps in joules, but using eV as unit.\n\nThe correct energy difference would be ΔE ≥ 7.2 × 10^-7 eV or 0.72 μeV.

Alternatively, check if precise calculations:\n\n1.16e-25 J is equal to ?\n\nSince 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nThen 1.16e-25 J divided by 1e-6 eV would be (1.16e-25 /1.602e-19) eV = 7.24e-7 eV = 0.724 µeV ≈ 7.2 × 10^{-7} eV. So the answer would express this value, using numbers. But if the provided options are 10^{-6} eV (1 µeV) and 10^{-7} eV (0.1 µeV), then 7.2e-7 would be between 1e-6 and 1e-7. If the options include 1e-6 and 1e-7, but since 0.7μeV is closer to 1e-6 (which is 1μeV) [since 0.7 is closer to 1 than to 0.1]. Alternatively, if the option is  10^{ -6 } eV , then that is 1μeV, but the required difference is about 0.72 * 1μeV.\n\nSo possibly the intended answer is 1e-6 eV, but our calculation shows ~0.7e-6 eV.\n\nConclusively, according to calculations, the answer is ΔE ≈ 0.7 × 10^{-6} eV, hence 7 × 10^{-7} eV.

However, given that the result is precisely ~7e-7 eV, the correct box answer based on precise calculation is \\boxed{7 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ eV}}.\n\nBut there we go. Since the question hasn\'t given options, but we can actually compute the numerical value.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \) seconds and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty for each state is given by \( \Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau} \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

1. **Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:**
   - For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
     \[
     \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
     \[
     \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Total linewidth (sum of uncertainties):**
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} + 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \approx 1.16 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Convert energy to electron volts:**
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{total}} \, (\text{eV}) = \frac{1.16 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \approx 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}
   \]

To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must exceed the combined linewidth. Thus, the required energy difference is approximately \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

\[
\boxed{7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}}
\]

Thus, utilizing ΔE ≈ Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2) or in different approaches, sqrt((Γ1)^2 + (Γ2)^2). However, resonance linewidths typically add linearly when considering overlapping distributions. So I think using the sum might be more accurate here.

Given τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s:

Γ1 = ħ / (1e-9 s) ≈ (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J.

Γ2 = ħ / (1e-8 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J.

Adding Γ1 and Γ2: 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 ≈ 1.16e-25 J.

But converting that energy from joules to electron volts (since energies at quantum levels are often expressed in eV) using 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

ΔE (in J) = 1.16e-25 J. Therefore, in eV: 1.16e-25 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 microelectronvolts (μeV).

Alternatively, when using the sum of Γ1 and Γ2 as the necessary energy difference.

Alternatively, if we consider the natural linewidth to be the uncertainty in each, then when we determine the energy difference E2 - E1, how does that play?

Another approach: Each energy level's uncertainty contributes to the uncertainty in the transition between them. So the transition frequency's uncertainty would be given by linewidths from each state.

The frequency linewidth Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2, so converting that to energy via E = ħω, so Γ_total (energy) = Γ1 + Γ2. Hence the same conclusion as above: E2 - E1 should be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 to distinguish.

Therefore, if we calculate Γ_total = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/(1e-9 s) + (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/(1e-8 s).

Calculate Γ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J

Γ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J

Total Γ = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J (as before), ≈ 0.724 μeV.

So the energy difference ΔE needs to be greater than about 0.724 μeV to clearly resolve them.

But let's check if perhaps the question is referring to using the energy uncertainty product ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. But since each state has its own ΔE, so how are they combined?

Alternatively, perhaps it's using ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt), but combining the uncertainties as:

If we model each energy level's uncertainty, the uncertainty in E2 - E1 would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). So:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (1.0545718e-34)/(2*1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J

ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) = (1.05e-34 /2e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J

So the combined uncertainty would be sqrt( (5.27e-26)^2 + (5.27e-27)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2.778e-51 + 2.778e-54) ≈ sqrt(2.78e-51) ≈ 5.27e-26 J

Convert to eV: 5.27e-26 /1.6e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 0.329 μeV

Therefore, if ΔE > 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 0.33 μeV, then perhaps.

But this would be if the uncertainty in the difference is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )

Alternatively, perhaps using ΔE ≥ combined (ΔE1 + ΔE2) which would be 5.27e-26 + 5.27e-27 = ~5.8e-26 J or ~0.36 μeV.

But in standard resolution criteria, such as the Rayleigh criterion, for two spectral lines to be resolved, their separation should be greater than the sum of their linewidths. Since in this case each energy level contributes its own linewidth, the combined linewidth of the transition would be Γ1 + Γ2 (because each time you measure a transition, the broadening from each state adds up). So perhaps going back to the ~0.724 μeV as the minimum energy separation required.

So these are two possible answers depending on approach: 0.33 μeV using uncertainty sum in quadrature, and 0.72 μeV using linewidth sum.

Which is correct in this context?

In spectroscopy, when two energy levels are involved in a transition, each with their own natural linewidth, the total linewidth of the transition is indeed the sum of the individual linewidths (Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2). Therefore, the energies can be resolved if their separation is greater than Γ_total. Therefore, the necessary energy difference is Γ1 + Γ2.

Expressed numerically, with τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s:

Γ1 = ħ/τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J

Γ2 = ħ/τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J

Sum Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.16e-25 J ≈ 0.724 μeV

Thus, to clearly resolve the energy levels, their energy difference should exceed approximately 0.724 μeV. But the problem is given in some multiple-choice options, so perhaps the product may involve options around that value. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, Planck constant: in some contexts, people use h instead of ħ. Wait, need to clarify:

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ or sometimes approximated ΔE Δt ≈ h/(2π)/2, which would be (ΔE * Δt) ≥ ħ/2. So yes, Γ = ħ / τ would be the FWHM linewidth.

Alternatively, natural linewidth is given by Γ = (1/(2π)) * ħ/τ ???

Wait, actually in natural linewidth, the relation comes from the Fourier transform of the exponential decay, and the FWHM of the Lorentzian line shape is Γ = ħ/τ.

Wait, let me confirm: the fundamental relation comes from the time-energy uncertainty principle. If a state has a mean lifetime τ, then the uncertainty in energy is at least ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). Therefore, the energy uncertainty (FWHM) is Γ = 2ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. So yes, Γ = ħ / τ. So Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2, the total linewidth when observing a transition between these two states would be Γ1 + Γ2. Because each state's linewidth contributes to the overall linewidth of the transition.

Therefore, the answer would relate to Γ1 + Γ2 converted into energy.

But possibly the actual question is about just distinguishing the two energy levels, not a transition between them. In such a case, perhaps each energy level has its own uncertainty, so to tell them apart, the separation has to be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties (if considering the worst case), or perhaps the quadrature sum.

For example, if E1 has uncertainty δE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and E2 has δE2 = ħ/(2τ2), then the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 has uncertainty sqrt( (δE1)^2 + (δE2)^2 ) from propagation of uncertainty.

In that case, the energy difference would need to be larger than this combined uncertainty to be distinguishable.

Therefore, necessary ΔE > sqrt( (ħ/2τ1)^2 + (ħ/2τ2)^2 ) = ħ/2 * sqrt(1/τ1² + 1/τ2² )

Calculating that:

√(1/(1e-9)^2 + 1/(1e-8)^2) = √(1e18 + 1e16) = √(1.01e18) ≈ 1.005e9 s^-1

Thus, ħ/2 * 1.005e9 ≈ (1.0545718e-34 / 2) * 1.005e9 ≈ 5.27e-26 J

Convert this to eV: 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 0.329 μeV

So this approach leads to a different result. Hence conflicting conclusions. So, alternative reasoning.

The question is about resolving two energy levels. If each energy level's energy is distributed with some uncertainty due to their finite lifetimes, then the uncertainty in their energies would contribute to the difficulty in distinguishing them. If their energy difference is much larger than their individual uncertainties, then they are resolvable.

In measurement, the criterion for the resolvability of two quantities with uncertainties typically involves the separation being greater than the sum of their uncertainties (like one sigma separation vs. two sigma in statistics). But in other contexts, such as the Rayleigh criterion in optics, the separation needs to be at least the width of the diffraction patterns (usually the sum of half-maximums), which would correspond here to the sum of the linewidths.

Therefore, possibly in this question, when it's said to 'clearly distinguish,' we should use Γ1 + Γ2.

Alternatively, if we consider standard uncertainty addition, it may be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²).

This discrepancy is central. So where does the difference stem from?

The linewidth in emission or absorption lines typically is due to the sum of the uncertainties of the two levels involved in the transition. For spontaneous emission, when an electron drops from an upper state to a lower state, the natural linewidth of the transition is given by the sum of the reciprocal lifetimes. Γ_total = Γ_upper + Γ_lower. That is because the transition itself involves the decay rates of both states. Alternatively, if you are measuring just the energy levels (e.g., through some other means), maybe using two separate measurements, the combined uncertainty would be different.

However, the problem statement says, "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels." If you are trying to distinguish E1 and E2, maybe from each other's perspective, their own energy uncertainty is due to their lifetimes, so each has an uncertainty ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). Then for being able to resolve the difference, assuming E2 > E1, and we have some measurement that can measure these energies. The accuracy of the energy measurement is limited by their uncertainties, so in order to distinguish E1 and E2, the difference |E2 - E1| should be greater than the combined uncertainty, which can be considered as the sum or the quadrature sum.

However, when combining uncertainties, if they are independent, the total uncertainty is quadrature sum. That is, if you measure E1 with uncertainty ΔE1 and E2 with uncertainty ΔE2, then the uncertainty in the difference is sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2). So, to resolve them clearly, the actual difference must be greater than this uncertainty.

That would be the standard approach in error analysis, so likely need to use that.

Therefore compute:

ΔE = sqrt( (ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ) )

Plugging τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE = ħ/2 * sqrt( (1 / τ1^2) + (1 / τ2^2) )

Calculating the sqrt term:

sqrt( (1/(1e-9)^2) + (1/(1e-8)^2) ) = sqrt(1e18 + 1e16) = sqrt(1.01e18) ≈ 1.005e9 s^{-1}

So,

ΔE ≈ (1.0545718e-34 J·s / 2) * 1.005e9 s^{-1}

≈ (5.272859e-35 J·s) * 1.005e9 s^{-1} ≈ 5.299e-26 J

Converting to eV: divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV: 5.299e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.31e-7 eV ≈ 0.331 μeV

Alternatively, they may refer to the full width half max linewidth Γ, which for each state is Γ = ħ / τ. Then the sum of the linewidths Γ1 + Γ2.

Γ1 = ħ / (1e-9) = 1.0545718e-25 J

Γ2 = ħ / (1e-8) = 1.0545718e-26 J

Γ_total = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J = 1.16e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV

Thus, if the requirement is that the energy difference should exceed the sum of the linewidths (i.e., Γ_total). The answer would be ~0.72 μeV.

But this depends on the criterion. Different textbooks/researchers may use different criteria for resolution.

Commonly in spectroscopy, resolving two spectral lines requires that their line profiles don't overlap significantly. If each line has a Lorentzian profile with FWHM of Γ1 and Γ2, their separation must be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 to resolve them. If they are separated by more than their combined widths, then they can be distinguished. This approach indeed leads to the sum of the widths.

Alternatively, when dealing with uncertainty in measurements, the uncertainties should be added in quadrature, giving a slightly lower requirement.

But the question is about clearly distinguishing the two energy levels. So which is intended?

The Heisenberg uncertainty gives the energy spread (uncertainty) for each energy level as ΔE ~ ħ / τ. So each level's energy is "fuzzy" with that spread. Therefore, the two levels would need to be separated by more than the sum of their spreads to be resolvable.

Alternatively, using quadrature sum could be too restrictive or not. For example, in a statistical sense, two Gaussian distributions can be considered resolved if their means are separated by more than the sum of their standard deviations (as a rule of thumb). Although precisely, the resolution criterion differs: the Rayleigh criterion in optics for diffraction-limited resolution requires that the peak of one falls on the first minimum of the other. But in terms of Uncertainty principle broadening.

Here, since the lineshapes are Lorentzian (from exponential decay), which have broader wings than Gaussian. Maybe even 3 times the FWHM to make sure? But perhaps in the problem's context, they want the energy difference to be greater than the sum of the individual energy uncertainties (Γ1 + Γ2).

The problem is probably expecting me to use the energy-time uncertainty principle for each state, calculate their uncertainty (ΔE ≈ ħ / τ), then to resolve them, their energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties (ΔE1 + ΔE2). But some resources might consider adding in quadrature.

Wait, But in uncertainty terms, independent uncertainties add in quadrature. So, original question is "clearly distinguish", which in measurement terms likely implies that the separation should be larger than the combined uncertainty (quadrature). However, in spectroscopy, for natural linewidth, the total linewidth is sum, so it's added, not quadratically.

Given that the problem talks about "energy levels" which have lifetimes, so each energy level has a width of Γ = ħ / τ.

Then, when attempting to resolve two energies E1 and E2, each with their own widths, Γ1 and Γ2, the minimal energy difference required for resolution would have to be roughly the maximum of Γ1 and Γ2? Or exceeds the sum? Depends on how they overlap.

If the energy difference is smaller than the linewidths, obviously they blend. That is, if ΔE < Γ1 and Γ2, they are not resolvable. If ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2, then they can be resolved.

Alternatively, once the energy difference is greater than the sum of the linewidths, you can resolve them. So probably the answer is around ħ*(1/τ1 + 1/τ2) which would be ~1.16e-25 J [0.724 μeV]

But let's calculate that. Given τ1 = 1 ns, τ2 = 10 ns.

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/(1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J = 1.05e-25 J.

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Sum Γ_total = 1.05e-25 + 1.05e-26 ≈ 1.155e-25 J.

Convert to eV: as done before, ~0.724 μeV.

But wait, check another approach. The minimal resolvable energy difference can be determined by the lifetime of the states. The characteristic frequency width is related to the lifetime by Δω ≈ 1/τ for each state. So the frequency difference needed would be Δω >= 1/τ1 + 1/τ2 (for distinguishment). Then converting frequency to energy via ΔE = ħΔω ≈ ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).

Thus again, arriving at same value.

Thus, references suggest that the linewidth is basically ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. So adding the linewidths (as individual contributions) gives Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than this sum, so in this problem, the answer would be roughly ħ*(1e9 + 1e8) = this is  1.0545718e-34 * 1.1e9 = 1.16e-25 J (0.724 μeV).

Alternatively, let me check if the answer could be, say, obtained via ΔE = h/(2πτ), which for the shorter lifetime would be 10^-9 s: hence ΔE ≈ h/(2π *1e-9), and then requirements for resolution.

Wait, yes, but h/2π = ħ. Hence, yes, ΔE = ħ/τ (without factors) here. In earlier I put ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. Hence, the sum linewidth, sum the ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Therefore, it seems the analysis leads to the sum of the linewidths. Now let's compare this because in practical terms, for example, if the lifetime is τ = 1e-9 s, the energy uncertainty (FWHM) is Γ ≈ ħ/τ = 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25 J ≈ 0.6 μeV. For τ2=1e-8 s, Γ ≈ 0.06 μeV.

Hence, total linewidth 0.6 + 0.06 = 0.66 μeV.

Therefore, if the energy splitting is greater than about 0.7 μeV (approx.), then OK.

Looking at the possible answer options (hypothetically, since the user hasn't provided choices but asks to provide the answer), typically such problems gives options like 10^-6 eV, 10^-7 eV, etc.

From the options one has to choose, but as the user hasn't given the options. The process leads us to either ~0.33 μeV (quadrature sum) or ~0.72 μeV (sum). Given common spectroscopic practice, probably energy difference must exceed sum of the linewidths. Hence, likely the answer is approximately 1e-6 eV or ~1 μeV. However, wait. No, 0.72 μeV is 0.7e-6 eV, so 7e-7 eV.

Interestingly, considering solving for ΔE:

ΔE = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2)

Compute it:

1/τ1 + 1/τ2 = 1e9 + 1e8 = 1.1e9 s^{-1}

ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s

Then, energy: 1.05e-34 *1.1e9 = 1.155e-25 J

Convert to eV:

1.155e-25 / 1.602e-19 = 7.21e-7 eV ≈ 0.721 μeV

So 0.721 μeV. 

But if options were steps of powers of 10, maybe 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) would be the immediate step. Or 1e-7.

But in the problem statement, the answer should depend on the results from the calculation, regardless of the options. So unless the exact answer is needed, which is 0.72 μeV. However, since the user hasn't provided options, but asks to write the answer, I should present this calculated value. But the options are missing. Wait, the original problem says "Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" but the user hasn't provided the options. So he wants the assistant to answer without options.

Wait, original problem: the user copy-paste from somewhere and perhaps italics or images were missing. But actually, in the original question in the system, did they have given options? Since now it just says: "Two quantum states... Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" And the user just pastes the problem, but without the options, possibly truncated.

But given the thought process, the calculated required energy difference is ~0.7 μeV. To clearly resolve the energy levels, their separation needs to be larger than the sum of their individual linewidths. Hence, ħ*(1/τ1 + 1/τ2)=1.05e-34*(1e9 +1e8)=~1.16e-25 J=~0.72 μeV.

Expressed in more precise terms: 0.724 μeV. So states need to be separated by at least that. Hence, possible given that the evaluated result is approximately 0.7 μeV. Hence the energy difference must be greater than this value. Converting to another unit, perhaps in joules, but using eV as unit.

The correct energy difference would be ΔE ≥ 7.2 × 10^-7 eV or 0.72 μeV. The units may convert as 1 μeV is 1e-6 eV, so 0.72 μeV = 7.2e-7 eV, which is a specific answer.

Hence, the boxed answer is \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}. Wait, but 0.7e-6 is about 7e-7, which is closer to 1e-6 than to 1e-7. Alternatively, check if precise calculations:

1.16e-25 J is equal to ?

Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

Then 1.16e-25 J divided by 1e-6 eV would be (1.16e-25 /1.602e-19) eV = 7.24e-7 eV = 0.724 µeV ≈ 7.2 × 10^{-7} eV. So the answer would express this value, using numbers. But if the provided options are 10^{-6} eV (1 µeV) and 10^{-7} eV (0.1 µeV), then 7.2e-7 would be between 1e-6 and 1e-7. If the options include 1e-6 and 1e-7, but since 0.7μeV is closer to 1e-6 (which is 1μeV) [since 0.7 is closer to 1 than to 0.1]. Alternatively, if the option is  10^{ -6 } eV , then that is 1μeV, but the required difference is about 0.72 * 1μeV.

So possibly the intended answer is 1e-6 eV, but our calculation shows ~0.7e-6 eV.

Conclusively, according to calculations, the answer is ΔE ≈ 0.7 × 10^{-6} eV, hence 7 × 10^{-7} eV. But since options usually come in order of magnitude, perhaps the closest order is 10^{-6} eV. However, given that the result is precisely ~7e-7 eV, the correct box answer based on precise calculation is \boxed{7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}}.

But there we go. Since the question hasn't given options, but we can actually compute the numerical value. Thus, the answer is approximately 7.24 ×1e-7 eV, rounding, perhaps 7 × 1e-7 the closest.

But let\'s check that.\n\nWait, when you have two independent uncertainties contributing to the uncertainty in their difference, you take the square root of the sum of squares. So the combined uncertainty would be sqrt( ΔE1² + ΔE2² ). Then, the energy separation ΔE must be greater than this value to be resolvable.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the answer can be computed numerically.\n\nFirst, calculating the individual uncertainties:\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s\n\nΔE1 = ħ / (2 * 1e-9 s ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9 ≈ 5.27e-26 J\n\nΔE2 = ħ / (2 * 1e-8 s ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-8 ≈ 5.27e-27 J\n\nSo the sum of uncertainties is 5.27e-26 + 5.27e-27 ≈ 5.8e-26 J\n\nThe quadrature sum would be sqrt( (5.27e-26)^2 + (5.27e-27)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 2.78e-51 + 2.78e-54 ) ≈ sqrt( ~2.78e-51 ) ≈ 5.27e-26 J again. Since the second term is three orders smaller, summing in quadrature doesn\'t change much, total remains approximately 5.27e-26 J.\n\nHence, ΔE must be greater than roughly 5.3e-26 J to resolve the two levels.\n\nAlternatively, converting this to electron volts for intuition. Since 1 J = 6.242e18 eV.\n\nSo 5.3e-26 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 3.31e-8 eV.\n\nThus, energy difference should be greater than ~3.31e-8 eV. Let me cross-check:\n\nEnergy uncertainties:\n\nΔE in terms of eV can also be quickly found by recognizing that ħ in eV·s is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Then, using ΔE = ħ/(2τ).\n\nΔE1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / (2*1e-9 s) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 ≈ 3.291e-7 eV\n\nΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) ≈ 3.291e-8 eV\n\nSo total additive uncertainty is ~3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = ~3.62e-7 eV. Hmm, conflicting with previous calculation. Wait, in this case calculations using eV version gives 3.6e-7 eV, but when converting from J, it gave 3.31e-8 eV. There\'s a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let\'s double-check. The problem is that ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s, which is 6.582e-16 eV·s. So 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV ) = 6.582e-16 eV·s. Correct. Therefore, using ΔE = (6.582e-16 eV·s)/(2*τ). For τ1 = 1e-9 s:\n\nΔE1 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-9) eV ≈ 3.291e-7 eV\n\nSimilarly, ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) ≈ 3.291e-8 eV\n\nThus, total sum: approx 3.291e-7 + 0.3291e-7 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV.\n\nPreviously, when using J to eV conversion:\n\nOriginal uncertainty calculated as 5.27e-26 J, converted was 5.27e-26 *6.242e18 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. That\'s the total sum. Thus, more accurate—wait a minute, my first calculation uses converting uncertainties for each energy first and then sums.\n\nWait, that\'s inconsistent. Hmm. Wait... No, if Gamma1 is the linewidth for state 1, Gamma2 for state2. The total linewidth for an emission between these states would be Gamma1 + Gamma2 (since the transition\'s linewidth is the sum of each state\'s). So if the energy difference between E1 and E2 is greater than Gamma1 + Gamma2, they are resolvable.\n\nSo, each energy level has a linewidth given by Gamma = ħ / tau. Then, the linewidth for transitions (energy uncertainty) is Gamma1 + Gamma2.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct sum of the linewidths (Gamma1 + Gamma2) is calculated, then the energy difference must be larger than this.\n\nSo using the eV approach:\n\nGamma1 = ħ / tau1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV\n\nGamma2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV\n\nThus, Gamma_total = 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nHence, energy difference would need to be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nHold on, this conflicts with the previous two different calculations using different methods, which gave 3.62e-7 eV and 3.29e-7 eV. Why the difference?\n\nWait a second. Let me be precise.\n\nWhat defines the energy uncertainty here? Is it the linewidth of the transition, which is indeed the sum of the linewidths of the two energy levels. In atomic transitions, the uncertainty in the photon\'s energy is the sum of the uncertainties in the two energy levels. Each energy level\'s uncertainty is given by Gamma = ħ / tau. Then, for the transition between them, the linewidth is Gamma1 + Gamma2.\n\nSo, the FWHM (full width at half maximum) of the transition line would be the sum. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than the FWHM to be resolvable. However, even here, Rayleigh\'s criterion comes into play, which for resolution requires that the separation is at least the FWHM. So if the energy levels are separated by more than the width of the transition\'s line, then they can be resolved.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct approach is linewidth of transition = Gamma1 + Gamma2 = ħ*(1/tau1 + 1/tau2).\n\nBut let\'s compute this.\n\nUsing tau1=1e-9:\n\n1/tau1 = 1e9 s^-1\n\nSimilarly, tau2=1e-8, so 1/tau2=1e8 s^-1.\n\nHence, Gamma1 = ħ*(1e9), and Gamma2= ħ*(1e8), so total Gamma= ħ*(1.1e9). Hence in energy terms: 6.582e-16 eV·s * 1.1e9 s^-1 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nTherefore, for the two energy levels to be resolvable, their energy difference ΔE should be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV. However, usually, the condition might be one\'s linewidth. But presumably, the combined linewidth is the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s the width of each energy level. When you measure the energy of each level, each is uncertain by their respective Gamma. Therefore, the total uncertainty in the energy difference is the combined uncertainty. If the uncertainties are independent, the total uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt( (Gamma1/2)^2 + (Gamma2/2)^2 ), perhaps? Wait.\n\nNo, perhaps let me recall: If two quantities E1 and E2 have uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the uncertainty in the difference E2 - E1 is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). The Heisenberg uncertainty gives a standard deviation, so the linewidth is a measure of the full width, but I think the FWHM relates to the standard deviation for a Lorentzian distribution, which is different. Hmm, actually, the natural linewidth (Lorentzian) has a FWHM of Γ (deltaE), but the standard deviation isn\'t straightforward as, Lorentzian distributions have undefined variance. In such cases, using the FWHM is more common. In terms of the ability to resolve two lines, the Rayleigh criterion states that two lines are resolved when their separation is at least equal to their FWHM. However, in this case, each line would have a linewidth Gamma1 and Gamma2. Wait, if you\'re considering two separate transitions, perhaps overlapping. But in actuality, if you have two energy levels with different widths, to resolve them, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their individual linewidths (so that the peaks don\'t overlap). For example, if each level is observed by its transition to another common level, then the transition lines would have widths Gamma1 and Gamma2, so their separation needs to exceed half the sum if using some criterion. But I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, if each energy level E1 and E2 is measured in some way with their own uncertainties (from lifetimes), then energy resolution to distinguish E1 and E2 must have their separation greater than the total uncertainty from both. That uncertainty is the uncertainty in their difference, hence sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). However, since linewidths arise from exponential decay (implying Lorentzian lineshapes), the concept of variance doesn\'t carry, but FWHM does. So perhaps use the sum of the linewidths.\n\nBut considering this discrepancy in approaches, given that there are practical methods for line broadening, perhaps in such context the energy resolution requires the energy difference to be greater than the sum of the natural linewidths.\n\nAlternatively, think about a specific example. If each level has a natural linewidth Gamma1 and Gamma2, then transitions between them would contribute a linewidth of Gamma1 + Gamma2. If you are measuring the energy difference between E2 and E1, e.g., through a photon emission with energy E2 - E1, then the linewidth of that photon would be Gamma1 + Gamma2 from the uncertainty in each level. Thus, to resolve the energy levels via the emitted photon\'s energy, the linewidth (uncertainty in energy) is Gamma1 + Gamma2. Therefore, if one wants to "clearly distinguish" these two energy levels, possibly via the emitted photon\'s spectral line, the energy difference would need to be greater than the uncertainty (linewidth) in that photon\'s energy. Hence, Delta E > Gamma1 + Gamma2.\n\nThus, following that logic, the energy difference needs to exceed their sum. Since Gamma1 = ħ/tau1, Gamma2 = ħ/tau2. So the total Gamma = ħ*(1/tau1 + 1/tau2) ≈ ħ*(1e9 +1e8) = ħ*1.1e9.\n\nCompute Gamma in eV:\n\n6.582e-16 eV·s * 1.1e9 s⁻¹ = 6.582*1.1e-7 eV ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference needs to be greater than approximately 7.2e-7 eV. Compare this to possible options. Since the given options (though missing) would need us to pick a number, perhaps the correct answer is around 1e-6 eV, or 1 microelectronvolt. So any energy difference above the order of 1e-6 eV would be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, if the options are in different units, maybe Joules. In any case, the critical calculation is computing the Gamma_total.\n\nIf given options include, for instance, 10^-6 eV or 10^-8 eV, etc., we need to compare. If we found Gamma_total ≈7.2e-7 eV≈ 0.72 μeV, so options above this would work, like 1 μeV, hence 1e-6 eV. Alternatively, if the options are given in Joules, 7.24e-7 eV is roughly 1.16e-25 J (since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 7.24e-7 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV≈1.16e-25 J.)\n\nAlternatively, let\'s recast:\n\nGamma1 for τ=1e-9: 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, Gamma2=6.58e-16 /1e-8=6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSum Gamma_total=6.58e-7 +6.58e-8=7.24e-7 eV. So ≈0.724 μeV.\n\nSo answer probably is of order 1e-6 eV, or 1 μeV. Or if converting, to other units such as frequency. Since ΔE = h*f. So f = Delta E / h. For Delta E=7.24e-7 eV, h=4.135667696e-15 eV·s. So f=(7.24e-7 eV)/(4.135667696e-15 eV·s)≈1.75e8 Hz=175 MHz. Thus, if answer options state energy difference in terms of h*f or provide frequency, 175 MHz would be the linewidth. Therefore, the energy split should exceed 175 MHz in frequency. Converting to wavelength: λ = c/f, c=3e8 m/s, so 3e8 / 1.75e8≈1.71 meters. Likely, visible light transition would need to be for very small energy differences.\n\nBut likely, the answer expects the energy difference to be greater than the summed linewidth. Hence, in energy terms around 1e-6 eV. Given that, likely, their options are in that ballpark.\n\nIf I cross-check units: 1.0e-6 eV is a millionth of an eV. Since thermal energy at room temp is about 0.025 eV, so 1e-6 eV is quite a small energy. Therefore, provided that the system can measure energies down to such scales, but in real-life contexts, such as atomic transitions, they usually involve larger energies (eV scales), so linewidths accumulate due to other factors, but perhaps here in the problem, we just follow the Heisenberg principle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers each energy uncertainty as ΔE1 and ΔE2, so the total uncertainty quadratically summed. Then total delta E = sqrt( (ħ/(2tau1))² + (ħ/(2tau2))² ) = ħ/(2) sqrt(1/tau1² +1/tau2² )\n\nCompute that: tau1=1e-9. tau2=1e-8.\n\nThat\'s sqrt(1e18 +1e16)=sqrt(1.01e18)≈1.005e9.\n\nThus delta E ≈ ħ/2 *1.005e9\n\n≈ (1.0545718e-34 J s)/2 *1.005e9 s⁻¹ ≈0.5 *1.054e-34 *1.005e9≈ 0.529e-25 J, which is 0.529e-25 J /1.602e-19 J/eV≈3.3e-7 eV, ok. So previously, 3.3e-7 eV via summing in quadrature.\n\nIf so, if using quad, ≈3.3e-7 eV, but considering the lifetime causes 1/tau dependence for linewidth. Therefore, if the problem requires distinguishing by the Rayleigh criterion ΔE ≥ Gamma1 + Gamma2 ≈7e-7 eV. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects that the minimal energy difference is on the order of h-bar over the shortest lifetime.\n\nBut perhaps this is conflicting.  Different thought processes here.\n\n A key point is the criteria for resolvability, and here, if the energy difference is greater than the combined linewidths (sum of natural linewidths), then they can be resolved.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference must be greater than Gamma1 +Gamma2=ħ(1/tau1 +1/tau2)). In terms of numbers:\n\nUsing ħ=1.0545718e-34 Js.\n\nConverting Gamma1 and Gamma2:\n\nGamma1=1.0545718e-34/(1e-9)=1.0546e-25 J\n\nGamma2=1.0545718e-34/(1e-8)=1.0546e-26 J\n\nSum =1.0546e-25 +1.0546e-26=1.16e-25 J.\n\nEnergy difference ΔE needs to be >1.16e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.16e-25 J /1.602e-19 J/eV≈7.25e-7 eV, which matches previous result.\n\nTherefore, answer is around 7e-7 eV. So if the options contain a value like 1e-6 eV (which is 1 μeV) or 7e-7 eV, then it would be valid.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might accept sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), which we also calculated ~3.3e-7 eV. But in practice, to resolve two peaks in spectroscopy, the separation is usually compared to sum of FWHM. So probably, 2*(sum of uncertainties?), depending on strictness. \n\nBut given that it\'s a textbook problem, the key formula here Heisenberg\'s uncertainty connecting lifetime to energy spread. The energy uncertainty per state is given by ΔE≈ ħ / (2tau). So ΔE for state1 is 5.27e-26 J, state2 is 5.27e-27 J. Then the total uncertainty in the energy difference is sqrt( (5.27e-26)^2 + (5.27e-27)^2 )≈5.3e-26 J. Let me convert that to eV: 5.3e-26 J *6.242e18 eV/J≈3.31e-7 eV. So if the question considers the resolution requiring deltaE > total uncertainty, then it\'s 3.31e-7 eV. But wait; the first approach said using Γ=ħ / tau leading to sum 7e-7 eV.\n\nSo now, since two different answers can emerge depending on how you calculate the minimal energy difference: sum of linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2) or sqrt of sum squares (σ total)?\n\nThe confusion comes from what "clearly distinguish" means in terms of signal. If you have two Lorentzians with widths Gamma1 and Gamma2 that the peaks are separated by more than FWHM, such that their combined intensity drops between the peaks, then the required separation is about the average of the two widths. But there isn\'t a strict formula; however, the most precise method is to use the sum of the linewidths, correctly calculating the FWHM of the combined profile. Though possibly need to use the convolution of the two Lorentzians—creating a more complicated lineshape—but likely for resolution, the criterion is the separation exceeds the FWHM. Alternatively, if measuring energy levels independently, each with a certain uncertainty, then their energies are known within their respective uncertainties. To tell them apart, the difference should exceed the absolute uncertainties combined.\n\nFor example, if E1 has uncertainty ΔE1 and E2 has ΔE2, the minimal difference required would be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²) as the total uncertainty in the difference, and so to resolve, difference must exceed this.\n\nTherefore, basing on that, if those are the uncertainties in the energies, then the precisely required energy diff is sqrt( (ħ/(2tau1))² + (ħ/(2tau2))² )\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\nsqrt( (5.27e-26 J)^2 + (5.27e-27 J)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2.78e-51 +2.78e-54 ) ≈5.27e-26 J ≈3.3e-7 eV.\n\nTherefore, depending on interpretation, answer is either ~3.3e-7 eV or ~7.2e-7 eV. Hmm.\n\nBut going back to textbook. Say, in quantum mechanics, Each energy level has an uncertainty given by deltaE ≈ ħ / (2tau). To resolve two separate energies, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties (this is a common heuristic). Otherwise, the two energies overlap. That is, the peaks in the spectrum would blend if the separation is less than the sum of their linewidths.\n\nAlternatively, 3.3e-7 vs 7.2e-7. Different which uncertainties. Wait, Gamma is h-bar over tau: Γ=ħ/tau (for FWHM). To relate, Γ=2ΔE from HUP, since deltaE^deltaT≈ħ/2, hence deltaE≈ħ/(2 deltaT), but Γ corresponds to FWHM=2deltaE.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the linewidth (Gamma) is actually two times the uncertainty in energy: Γ=2ΔE. Therefore, if the HUP states deltaE * deltaT ≈ ħ/2, then deltaE= ħ/(2 deltaT). Whereas the linewidth (Gamma) is thought of  ΔE in the classical sense (Full width), which for a decaying exponential relates to twice the HUP half-width. Therefore, Gamma=2 deltaE= ħ / tau.\n\nTherefore, the linewidth is ħ / tau. Thus, total linewidth Gamma1 + Gamma2 = ħ (1/tau1 +1/tau2 ). Then, DeltaE_photon = E2-E1 must be greater than Gamma1 + Gamma2 to clearly resolve. Therefore, energy separation GreaterThan 1.05e-34 /1e-9 +1.05e-34 /1e-8 ) =1.05e-25 +1.05e-26 ≈1.16e-25 J ≈7.2e-7 eV.\n\nThus, in conclusion, based on linewidths which are significant for the transition between the two states, the minimal energy difference for them not to overlap is approximately 7.2e-7 eV. Hmm.. If the actual intended answer uses HUP deltaE1 + deltaE2= ħ/(2 tau1) + ħ/(2 tau2)= (6.58e-16 eV s /2)* (1e9 +1e8)s^−1→(3.29e-16)(1.1e9)=3.62e-7 eV.\n\nBut having these two conflicting methods. It arises because of the definition of linewidth:  are you adding the standard error in energy (sum quadratically), deltaE, or adding the full linewidth (Gamma) （sum linearly）?\n\nWhich one is the correct to criteria for resolvability?\n\nThis probably is context dependent. In spectroscopy, the linewidths add (as in transit broadening) when two states decaying to a common state. The emitted photon\'s frequency uncertainty is the sum of the uncertainties of the two energy levels.\n\nTherefore, the FWHM of the emitted photon\'s energy would be Gamma1 + Gamma2. Therefore, for two transitions to adjacent energy levels to be resolved, their separation must be longer than the sum of their linewidths. So the correct answer is approximately7e-7 eV. In most textbooks, the natural linewidth is given as Gamma=ħ/tau. Hence, to resolve two energy levels, their separation must exceed the sum of the natural linewidths. Therefore, even in the classic textbook literature, when considering a transition between two states with widths Gamma1 and Gamma2, the transition\'s linewidth is the sum of both widths.\n\nSo going back, the correct approach comes from that, so the minimal resolvable energy difference is approximately7e-7 eV.\n\nTherefore, if given possible options, it\'s likely 10^-6 eV (1 μeV) because it\'s larger than 7.24e-7 eV (0.724 μeV). Or another option of 1e-7 eV (which would be 0.1 μeV) would be too small. Assuming the available options were in factors order of magnitudes, the answer should be closest to one order higher, 1e-6 eV.\n\nBut since the actual calculated value is ~7.2e-7 eV, if this is available as an option, select that. If not, pick the first option larger than it.\n\nBut as the original user hasn\'t provided options, but requested an explanation, the answer would need to box write approx value.\n\nBut since we are told to select "their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved", regardless of the available options, which the user didn\'t include, but perhaps it\'s intended for me to proceed originally.\n\nWait, the problem says "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?"\n\nThough the options are not provided here. But I had to reason so as per given data…\n\nSince the required energy difference must be greater than sum of their line widths. As each energy level contributes to the width. Thus, the minimal energy difference would be \\boxed{10^{-6} \\text{ eV}} if that\'s the approximate option. But exact value is approximately 0.7μeV.\n\nBut if options are in Joules: 7.2e-7 eV is approx 1.15e-25 J. Or numbers like 10^-25 J, perhaps.\n\nBut in absence of options, the answer should be the calculated minimum energy delta which is7.24e-7 eV≈7 x10^-7 eV.\n\nBut for the purpose of standard tests, common answer choices probably would list in terms of inverse centimeters (wavenumbers) or other units, but guess σ, the answer in eV isaround what was found. As\n\nAs per the initial calculations, summarizing:\n\nTo clearly resolve two energy levels with given lifetimes, their energy difference must exceed the sum of the energy uncertainties given by their respective lifetimes. Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle with lifetime contributing to energy uncertainty (linewidth), we find the required energy difference is approximately 7.2 × 10^-7 eV. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be this value. If rounding or order of magnitude is considered, 10^-6（1 μeV）eV or 1e-25 J could be possible candidates. However, precise answer is ħ*(1/tau1 +1/tau2).\n\nWait, here are precise steps:\n\nΔE > ħ(1/tau1 +1/tau2)\n\nCompute this:\n\nGiven:\n\ntau1=1e-9,\ntau2=1e-8.\n\n1/tau1 +1/tau2=1e9 +1e8=1.1e9 s⁻¹.\n\nMultiply by hbar=1.0545718e-34 J*s.\n\nΔE=1.0545718e-34 *1.1e9=1.16e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV:\n\n1.16e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈7.25e-7 eV=0.725 μeV.\n\nTherefore, energy difference ΔE must be greater than 7.25e-7 eV=0.725 μeV. Hence, the boxed answer with this number.\n\nBut given the absence of specific options, typically expected answer. If hypothesized that available options are, say, 1e-6 eV (1 μeV), 1e-7 eV, etc., then 7.25e-7 is closest to 1 μeV, but if the testing options have arrow ranges split decimal points, possibly not. Since I can\'t see the options, but box the actual calculated value.\n\nAlternatively, in Joules: 1.16e-25 J.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \) seconds and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty (linewidth) of each state is given by \( \Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau} \).

1. **Calculate the linewidths for each state:**
   - For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
     \]
   - For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
     \]

2. **Sum the linewidths to find the total energy uncertainty:**
   \[
   \Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must exceed the total linewidth. Therefore, the energy difference should be approximately \( 7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

\[
\boxed{7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Squaring would reduce the sum, so actually, the sum vs quadrature sum: who prevails. But let's check that.

Wait, when you have two independent uncertainties contributing to the uncertainty in their difference, you take the square root of the sum of squares. So the combined uncertainty would be sqrt( ΔE1² + ΔE2² ). Then, the energy separation ΔE must be greater than this value to be resolvable.

In any case, perhaps the answer can be computed numerically.

First, calculating the individual uncertainties:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * 1e-9 s ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9 ≈ 5.27e-26 J

ΔE2 = ħ / (2 * 1e-8 s ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-8 ≈ 5.27e-27 J

So the sum of uncertainties is 5.27e-26 + 5.27e-27 ≈ 5.8e-26 J

The quadrature sum would be sqrt( (5.27e-26)^2 + (5.27e-27)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( 2.78e-51 + 2.78e-54 ) ≈ sqrt( ~2.78e-51 ) ≈ 5.27e-26 J again. Since the second term is three orders smaller, summing in quadrature doesn't change much, total remains approximately 5.27e-26 J.

Hence, ΔE must be greater than roughly 5.3e-26 J to resolve the two levels.

Alternatively, converting this to electron volts for intuition. Since 1 J = 6.242e18 eV.

So 5.3e-26 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 3.31e-8 eV.

Thus, energy difference should be greater than ~3.31e-8 eV. Let me cross-check:

Energy uncertainties:

ΔE in terms of eV can also be quickly found by recognizing that ħ in eV·s is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Then, using ΔE = ħ/(2τ).

ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / (2*1e-9 s) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 ≈ 3.291e-7 eV

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) ≈ 3.291e-8 eV

So total additive uncertainty is ~3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = ~3.62e-7 eV. Hmm, conflicting with previous calculation. Wait, in this case calculations using eV version gives 3.6e-7 eV, but when converting from J, it gave 3.31e-8 eV. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, let's double-check. The problem is that ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s, which is 6.582e-16 eV·s. So 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV ) = 6.582e-16 eV·s. Correct. Therefore, using ΔE = (6.582e-16 eV·s)/(2*τ). For τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-9) eV ≈ 3.291e-7 eV

Similarly, ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / (2e-8) ≈ 3.291e-8 eV

Thus, total sum: approx 3.291e-7 + 0.3291e-7 ≈ 3.62e-7 eV.

Previously, when using J to eV conversion:

Original uncertainty calculated as 5.27e-26 J, converted was 5.27e-26 *6.242e18 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. That's the total sum. Thus, more accurate—wait a minute, my first calculation uses converting uncertainties for each energy first and then sums.

Wait, that's inconsistent. Hmm. Wait... No, if Gamma1 is the linewidth for state 1, Gamma2 for state2. The total linewidth for an emission between these states would be Gamma1 + Gamma2 (since the transition's linewidth is the sum of each state's). So if the energy difference between E1 and E2 is greater than Gamma1 + Gamma2, they are resolvable.

So, each energy level has a linewidth given by Gamma = ħ / tau. Then, the linewidth for transitions (energy uncertainty) is Gamma1 + Gamma2.

Therefore, perhaps the correct sum of the linewidths (Gamma1 + Gamma2) is calculated, then the energy difference must be larger than this.

So using the eV approach:

Gamma1 = ħ / tau1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV

Gamma2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV

Thus, Gamma_total = 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.

Hence, energy difference would need to be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Hold on, this conflicts with the previous two different calculations using different methods, which gave 3.62e-7 eV and 3.29e-7 eV. Why the difference?

Wait a second. Let me be precise.

What defines the energy uncertainty here? Is it the linewidth of the transition, which is indeed the sum of the linewidths of the two energy levels. In atomic transitions, the uncertainty in the photon's energy is the sum of the uncertainties in the two energy levels. Each energy level's uncertainty is given by Gamma = ħ / tau. Then, for the transition between them, the linewidth is Gamma1 + Gamma2.

So, the FWHM (full width at half maximum) of the transition line would be the sum. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be greater than the FWHM to be resolvable. However, even here, Rayleigh's criterion comes into play, which for resolution requires that the separation is at least the FWHM. So if the energy levels are separated by more than the width of the transition's line, then they can be resolved.

Thus, perhaps the correct approach is linewidth of transition = Gamma1 + Gamma2 = ħ*(1/tau1 + 1/tau2).

But let's compute this.

Using tau1=1e-9:

1/tau1 = 1e9 s^-1

Similarly, tau2=1e-8, so 1/tau2=1e8 s^-1.

Hence, Gamma1 = ħ*(1e9), and Gamma2= ħ*(1e8), so total Gamma= ħ*(1.1e9). Hence in energy terms: 6.582e-16 eV·s * 1.1e9 s^-1 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

Therefore, for the two energy levels to be resolvable, their energy difference ΔE should be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV. However, usually, the condition might be one's linewidth. But presumably, the combined linewidth is the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the width of each energy level. When you measure the energy of each level, each is uncertain by their respective Gamma. Therefore, the total uncertainty in the energy difference is the combined uncertainty. If the uncertainties are independent, the total uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt( (Gamma1/2)^2 + (Gamma2/2)^2 ), perhaps? Wait.

No, perhaps let me recall: If two quantities E1 and E2 have uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the uncertainty in the difference E2 - E1 is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). The Heisenberg uncertainty gives a standard deviation, so the linewidth is a measure of the full width, but I think the FWHM relates to the standard deviation for a Lorentzian distribution, which is different. Hmm, actually, the natural linewidth (Lorentzian) has a FWHM of Γ (deltaE), but the standard deviation isn't straightforward as, Lorentzian distributions have undefined variance. In such cases, using the FWHM is more common. In terms of the ability to resolve two lines, the Rayleigh criterion states that two lines are resolved when their separation is at least equal to their FWHM. However, in this case, each line would have a linewidth Gamma1 and Gamma2. Wait, if you're considering two separate transitions, perhaps overlapping. But in actuality, if you have two energy levels with different widths, to resolve them, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their individual linewidths (so that the peaks don't overlap). For example, if each level is observed by its transition to another common level, then the transition lines would have widths Gamma1 and Gamma2, so their separation needs to exceed half the sum if using some criterion. But I need to be careful here.

Alternatively, if each energy level E1 and E2 is measured in some way with their own uncertainties (from lifetimes), then energy resolution to distinguish E1 and E2 must have their separation greater than the total uncertainty from both. That uncertainty is the uncertainty in their difference, hence sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). However, since linewidths arise from exponential decay (implying Lorentzian lineshapes), the concept of variance doesn't carry, but FWHM does. So perhaps use the sum of the linewidths.

But considering this discrepancy in approaches, given that there are practical methods for line broadening, perhaps in such context the energy resolution requires the energy difference to be greater than the sum of the natural linewidths.

Alternatively, think about a specific example. If each level has a natural linewidth Gamma1 and Gamma2, then transitions between them would contribute a linewidth of Gamma1 + Gamma2. If you are measuring the energy difference between E2 and E1, e.g., through a photon emission with energy E2 - E1, then the linewidth of that photon would be Gamma1 + Gamma2 from the uncertainty in each level. Thus, to resolve the energy levels via the emitted photon's energy, the linewidth (uncertainty in energy) is Gamma1 + Gamma2. Therefore, if one wants to "clearly distinguish" these two energy levels, possibly via the emitted photon's spectral line, the energy difference would need to be greater than the uncertainty (linewidth) in that photon's energy. Hence, Delta E > Gamma1 + Gamma2.

Thus, following that logic, the energy difference needs to exceed their sum. Since Gamma1 = ħ/tau1, Gamma2 = ħ/tau2. So the total Gamma = ħ*(1/tau1 + 1/tau2) ≈ ħ*(1e9 +1e8) = ħ*1.1e9.

Compute Gamma in eV:

6.582e-16 eV·s * 1.1e9 s⁻¹ = 6.582*1.1e-7 eV ≈ 7.24e-7 eV.

Therefore, the energy difference needs to be greater than approximately 7.2e-7 eV. Compare this to possible options. Since the given options (though missing) would need us to pick a number, perhaps the correct answer is around 1e-6 eV, or 1 microelectronvolt. So any energy difference above the order of 1e-6 eV would be sufficient.

Alternatively, if the options are in different units, maybe Joules. In any case, the critical calculation is computing the Gamma_total.

If given options include, for instance, 10^-6 eV or 10^-8 eV, etc., we need to compare. If we found Gamma_total ≈7.2e-7 eV≈ 0.72 μeV, so options above this would work, like 1 μeV, hence 1e-6 eV. Alternatively, if the options are given in Joules, 7.24e-7 eV is roughly 1.16e-25 J (since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 7.24e-7 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV≈1.16e-25 J.)

Alternatively, let's recast:

Gamma1 for τ=1e-9: 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, Gamma2=6.58e-16 /1e-8=6.58e-8 eV.

Sum Gamma_total=6.58e-7 +6.58e-8=7.24e-7 eV. So ≈0.724 μeV.

So answer probably is of order 1e-6 eV, or 1 μeV. Or if converting, to other units such as frequency. Since ΔE = h*f. So f = Delta E / h. For Delta E=7.24e-7 eV, h=4.135667696e-15 eV·s. So f=(7.24e-7 eV)/(4.135667696e-15 eV·s)≈1.75e8 Hz=175 MHz. Thus, if answer options state energy difference in terms of h*f or provide frequency, 175 MHz would be the linewidth. Therefore, the energy split should exceed 175 MHz in frequency. Converting to wavelength: λ = c/f, c=3e8 m/s, so 3e8 / 1.75e8≈1.71 meters. Likely, visible light transition would need to be for very small energy differences.

But likely, the answer expects the energy difference to be greater than the summed linewidth. Hence, in energy terms around 1e-6 eV. Given that, likely, their options are in that ballpark.

If I cross-check units: 1.0e-6 eV is a millionth of an eV. Since thermal energy at room temp is about 0.025 eV, so 1e-6 eV is quite a small energy. Therefore, provided that the system can measure energies down to such scales, but in real-life contexts, such as atomic transitions, they usually involve larger energies (eV scales), so linewidths accumulate due to other factors, but perhaps here in the problem, we just follow the Heisenberg principle.

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers each energy uncertainty as ΔE1 and ΔE2, so the total uncertainty quadratically summed. Then total delta E = sqrt( (ħ/(2tau1))² + (ħ/(2tau2))² ) = ħ/(2) sqrt(1/tau1² +1/tau2² )

Compute that: tau1=1e-9. tau2=1e-8.

That's sqrt(1e18 +1e16)=sqrt(1.01e18)≈1.005e9.

Thus delta E ≈ ħ/2 *1.005e9

≈ (1.0545718e-34 J s)/2 *1.005e9 s⁻¹ ≈0.5 *1.054e-34 *1.005e9≈ 0.529e-25 J, which is 0.529e-25 J /1.602e-19 J/eV≈3.3e-7 eV, ok. So previously, 3.3e-7 eV via summing in quadrature.

If so, if using quad, ≈3.3e-7 eV, but considering the lifetime causes 1/tau dependence for linewidth. Therefore, if the problem requires distinguishing by the Rayleigh criterion ΔE ≥ Gamma1 + Gamma2 ≈7e-7 eV. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects that the minimal energy difference is on the order of h-bar over the shortest lifetime.

But perhaps this is conflicting.  Different thought processes here.

 A key point is the criteria for resolvability, and here, if the energy difference is greater than the combined linewidths (sum of natural linewidths), then they can be resolved.

Therefore, the energy difference must be greater than Gamma1 +Gamma2=ħ(1/tau1 +1/tau2)). In terms of numbers:

Using ħ=1.0545718e-34 Js.

Converting Gamma1 and Gamma2:

Gamma1=1.0545718e-34/(1e-9)=1.0546e-25 J

Gamma2=1.0545718e-34/(1e-8)=1.0546e-26 J

Sum =1.0546e-25 +1.0546e-26=1.16e-25 J.

Energy difference ΔE needs to be >1.16e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1.16e-25 J /1.602e-19 J/eV≈7.25e-7 eV, which matches previous result.

Therefore, answer is around 7e-7 eV. So if the options contain a value like 1e-6 eV (which is 1 μeV) or 7e-7 eV, then it would be valid.

Alternatively, the problem might accept sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), which we also calculated ~3.3e-7 eV. But in practice, to resolve two peaks in spectroscopy, the separation is usually compared to sum of FWHM. So probably, 2*(sum of uncertainties?), depending on strictness. 

But given that it's a textbook problem, the key formula here Heisenberg's uncertainty connecting lifetime to energy spread. The energy uncertainty per state is given by ΔE≈ ħ / (2tau). So ΔE for state1 is 5.27e-26 J, state2 is 5.27e-27 J. Then the total uncertainty in the energy difference is sqrt( (5.27e-26)^2 + (5.27e-27)^2 )≈5.3e-26 J. Let me convert that to eV: 5.3e-26 J *6.242e18 eV/J≈3.31e-7 eV. So if the question considers the resolution requiring deltaE > total uncertainty, then it's 3.31e-7 eV. But wait; the first approach said using Γ=ħ / tau leading to sum 7e-7 eV.

So now, since two different answers can emerge depending on how you calculate the minimal energy difference: sum of linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2) or sqrt of sum squares (σ total)?

The confusion comes from what "clearly distinguish" means in terms of signal. If you have two Lorentzians with widths Gamma1 and Gamma2 that the peaks are separated by more than FWHM, such that their combined intensity drops between the peaks, then the required separation is about the average of the two widths. But there isn't a strict formula; however, the most precise method is to use the sum of the linewidths, correctly calculating the FWHM of the combined profile. Though possibly need to use the convolution of the two Lorentzians—creating a more complicated lineshape—but likely for resolution, the criterion is the separation exceeds the FWHM. Alternatively, if measuring energy levels independently, each with a certain uncertainty, then their energies are known within their respective uncertainties. To tell them apart, the difference should exceed the absolute uncertainties combined.

For example, if E1 has uncertainty ΔE1 and E2 has ΔE2, the minimal difference required would be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²) as the total uncertainty in the difference, and so to resolve, difference must exceed this.

Therefore, basing on that, if those are the uncertainties in the energies, then the precisely required energy diff is sqrt( (ħ/(2tau1))² + (ħ/(2tau2))² )

Calculating this gives:

sqrt( (5.27e-26 J)^2 + (5.27e-27 J)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2.78e-51 +2.78e-54 ) ≈5.27e-26 J ≈3.3e-7 eV.

Therefore, depending on interpretation, answer is either ~3.3e-7 eV or ~7.2e-7 eV. Hmm.

But going back to textbook. Say, in quantum mechanics, Each energy level has an uncertainty given by deltaE ≈ ħ / (2tau). To resolve two separate energies, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties (this is a common heuristic). Otherwise, the two energies overlap. That is, the peaks in the spectrum would blend if the separation is less than the sum of their linewidths.

Alternatively, 3.3e-7 vs 7.2e-7. Different which uncertainties. Wait, Gamma is h-bar over tau: Γ=ħ/tau (for FWHM). To relate, Γ=2ΔE from HUP, since deltaE^deltaT≈ħ/2, hence deltaE≈ħ/(2 deltaT), but Γ corresponds to FWHM=2deltaE.

Therefore, perhaps the linewidth (Gamma) is actually two times the uncertainty in energy: Γ=2ΔE. Therefore, if the HUP states deltaE * deltaT ≈ ħ/2, then deltaE= ħ/(2 deltaT). Whereas the linewidth (Gamma) is thought of  ΔE in the classical sense (Full width), which for a decaying exponential relates to twice the HUP half-width. Therefore, Gamma=2 deltaE= ħ / tau.

Therefore, the linewidth is ħ / tau. Thus, total linewidth Gamma1 + Gamma2 = ħ (1/tau1 +1/tau2 ). Then, DeltaE_photon = E2-E1 must be greater than Gamma1 + Gamma2 to clearly resolve. Therefore, energy separation GreaterThan 1.05e-34 /1e-9 +1.05e-34 /1e-8 ) =1.05e-25 +1.05e-26 ≈1.16e-25 J ≈7.2e-7 eV.

Thus, in conclusion, based on linewidths which are significant for the transition between the two states, the minimal energy difference for them not to overlap is approximately 7.2e-7 eV. Hmm.. If the actual intended answer uses HUP deltaE1 + deltaE2= ħ/(2 tau1) + ħ/(2 tau2)= (6.58e-16 eV s /2)* (1e9 +1e8)s^−1→(3.29e-16)(1.1e9)=3.62e-7 eV.

But having these two conflicting methods. It arises because of the definition of linewidth:  are you adding the standard error in energy (sum quadratically), deltaE, or adding the full linewidth (Gamma) （sum linearly）?

Which one is the correct to criteria for resolvability?

This probably is context dependent. In spectroscopy, the linewidths add (as in transit broadening) when two states decaying to a common state. The emitted photon's frequency uncertainty is the sum of the uncertainties of the two energy levels.

Therefore, the FWHM of the emitted photon's energy would be Gamma1 + Gamma2. Therefore, for two transitions to adjacent energy levels to be resolved, their separation must be longer than the sum of their linewidths. So the correct answer is approximately7e-7 eV. In most textbooks, the natural linewidth is given as Gamma=ħ/tau. Hence, to resolve two energy levels, their separation must exceed the sum of the natural linewidths. Therefore, even in the classic textbook literature, when considering a transition between two states with widths Gamma1 and Gamma2, the transition's linewidth is the sum of both widths.

So going back, the correct approach comes from that, so the minimal resolvable energy difference is approximately7e-7 eV.

Therefore, if given possible options, it's likely 10^-6 eV (1 μeV) because it's larger than 7.24e-7 eV (0.724 μeV). Or another option of 1e-7 eV (which would be 0.1 μeV) would be too small. Assuming the available options were in factors order of magnitudes, the answer should be closest to one order higher, 1e-6 eV.

But since the actual calculated value is ~7.2e-7 eV, if this is available as an option, select that. If not, pick the first option larger than it.

But as the original user hasn't provided options, but requested an explanation, the answer would need to box write approx value.

But since we are told to select "their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved", regardless of the available options, which the user didn't include, but perhaps it's intended for me to proceed originally.

Wait, the problem says "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?"

Though the options are not provided here. But I had to reason so as per given data…

Since the required energy difference must be greater than sum of their line widths. As each energy level contributes to the width. Thus, the minimal energy difference would be \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}} if that's the approximate option. But exact value is approximately 0.7μeV.

But if options are in Joules: 7.2e-7 eV is approx 1.15e-25 J. Or numbers like 10^-25 J, perhaps.

But in absence of options, the answer should be the calculated minimum energy delta which is7.24e-7 eV≈7 x10^-7 eV.

But for the purpose of standard tests, common answer choices probably would list in terms of inverse centimeters (wavenumbers) or other units, but guess σ, the answer in eV isaround what was found. As

As per the initial calculations, summarizing:

To clearly resolve two energy levels with given lifetimes, their energy difference must exceed the sum of the energy uncertainties given by their respective lifetimes. Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle with lifetime contributing to energy uncertainty (linewidth), we find the required energy difference is approximately 7.2 × 10^-7 eV. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be this value. If rounding or order of magnitude is considered, 10^-6（1 μeV）eV or 1e-25 J could be possible candidates. However, precise answer is ħ*(1/tau1 +1/tau2).

Wait, here are precise steps:

ΔE > ħ(1/tau1 +1/tau2)

Compute this:

Given:

tau1=1e-9,
tau2=1e-8.

1/tau1 +1/tau2=1e9 +1e8=1.1e9 s⁻¹.

Multiply by hbar=1.0545718e-34 J*s.

ΔE=1.0545718e-34 *1.1e9=1.16e-25 J.

Convert to eV:

1.16e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈7.25e-7 eV=0.725 μeV.

Therefore, energy difference ΔE must be greater than 7.25e-7 eV=0.725 μeV. Hence, the boxed answer with this number.

But given the absence of specific options, typically expected answer. If hypothesized that available options are, say, 1e-6 eV (1 μeV), 1e-7 eV, etc., then 7.25e-7 is closest to 1 μeV, but if the testing options have arrow ranges split decimal points, possibly not. Since I can't see the options, but box the actual calculated value.

Alternatively, in Joules: 1.16e-25 J. That would be 1.2 x10^-25 J perhaps.

But since in the absence of options, the canonical answer would be  \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}  as a safe approximate. However, strictly it's \boxed{7.2 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}}.

Given the problem, if the system requires rounding, different story. But the most accurate answer is 7.2e-7.

Given the provided instructions to box the answer, but taking care of possibly which units. Since in original thought process various conversions, marked through Joules and eV.

But likely, the answer options (though missing) likely carry in between 1e-9 and such. However, 7.2e-7 eV corresponds to roughly 0.73 microelectronvolt.

Perhaps simplified, the right answer is h-bar over the harmonic mean or something else.

But I now think enough time spent on this problem. The strictest answer derived is 7.2e-7 eV.

**
Okay, after carefully considering the lifetimes and applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we calculate the energy uncertainty due to each state's lifetime. The energy difference must exceed the sum of these uncertainties to be resolvable. 

The final answer is found to be approximately \(7.2 \times 10^{-7}\) eV. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}}
