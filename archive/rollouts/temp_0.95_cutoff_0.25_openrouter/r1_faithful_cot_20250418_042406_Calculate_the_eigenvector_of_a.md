To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by expressing the components of the operator \(\vec{P}\) in terms of the given matrices:

- \(P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
- \(P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
- \(P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}\)

Since \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, it can be parametrized as \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\). The operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \sin\theta \cdot P_x + \cos\theta \cdot P_z
\]
Substituting the matrices for \(P_x\) and \(P_z\), we get:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right)
\]
Simplifying this matrix:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). This leads to the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

Solving the system of equations derived from the matrix equation:
1. \((\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \cdot b = 0\)
2. \(\sin\theta \cdot a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0\)

Expressing \(a\) in terms of \(b\) from the first equation:
\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b
\]
Using trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:
\[
a = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b
\]

Normalizing the eigenvector \([a, b]^T\):
\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 \implies \left|\cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b\right|^2 + |b|^2 = 1
\]
Using \(\cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}\), the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:
\[
\boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}
\]

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z look like. The problem statement gives them as:

P_x is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

Since the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So, the direction vector n can be written in spherical coordinates or just in terms of angles. But since it's in the x-z plane, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is 0 because it's in the x-z plane. Therefore, the components of n should be (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So, the operator P in the direction n would be the projection of the spin components onto n. Since n is in the x-z plane, the operator P·n would be P_x*sinθ + P_z*cosθ, right? Because there's no P_y component here.

Let me write that out. The operator P·n is (sinθ * P_x) + (cosθ * P_z). Substituting P_x and P_z:

P·n = (ħ/2) [sinθ * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]]

Let me compute that matrix. So, multiply sinθ into the first matrix and cosθ into the second:

First matrix component-wise: sinθ*0, sinθ*1; sinθ*1, sinθ*0 => [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
Second matrix component-wise: cosθ*1, cosθ*0; cosθ*0, cosθ*(-1) => [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together:

[[0 + cosθ, sinθ + 0], [sinθ + 0, 0 + (-cosθ)]]
= [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

But remember, this is multiplied by ħ/2. So the total operator P·n is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. However, eigenvalues for spin operators (like spin-1/2 systems) are typically ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

So, substituting our matrix, the eigenvalue equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2, which gives:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] |ψ> = |ψ>

Let me denote the eigenvector |ψ> as a column vector [a, b]^T. Then the equation becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ]   [a]   = [a]
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [b]     [b]

So expanding this, the first row gives: cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
The second row gives: sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write those equations:

1. cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2. sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me rearrange both equations to bring all terms to one side:

1. (cosθ - 1) * a + sinθ * b = 0
2. sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

So we have a system of linear equations:

[(cosθ - 1)    sinθ      ] [a]   = [0]
[ sinθ       -(cosθ + 1) ] [b]     [0]

To find non-trivial solutions (since eigenvectors cannot be the zero vector), the determinant of the coefficient matrix should be zero. But we already know this is an eigenvalue problem, so the determinant is zero because we're looking for eigenvectors. Hence, we can solve for a and b.

From the first equation: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

Let me express a in terms of b, or vice versa. Let's solve for a:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b

=> a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] * b

Similarly, from the second equation:

sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

=> sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b

=> a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] * b

So now we have two expressions for a in terms of b:

From first equation: a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] * b

From second equation: a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] * b

Therefore, these two expressions must be equal:

- sinθ / (cosθ - 1) = (cosθ + 1) / sinθ

Cross mulitplying:

- sin²θ = (cosθ + 1)(cosθ - 1 )

But (cosθ + 1)(cosθ -1 ) = cos²θ -1

So:

- sin²θ = cos²θ -1

But cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ, so:

- sin²θ = - sin²θ

Hence, this identity holds, so the equations are consistent. Therefore, we can use either equation to express a in terms of b.

Let's take one of them, maybe the second equation because the coefficients might be better. From a = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ * b

But note that cosθ -1 can be written as -2 sin²(θ/2) and cosθ +1 is 2 cos²(θ/2). These trigonometric identities might be helpful here. Also, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Perhaps simplifying the expression. Let's try expressing in terms of θ/2. Let me think.

Alternatively, express a/b from the first equation:

a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ -1 )

Note that cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2); and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So substituting:

a/b = - [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2)

Hence, a/b = cot(θ/2) => a = cot(θ/2) * b

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T = [ cot(θ/2) * b, b ]^T = b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T

Similarly, the other expression from the second equation: a = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ b

cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(theta/2), so a/b = 2 cos²(theta/2)/(2 sin(theta/2)cos(theta/2))) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2). So same result. So that's good, consistent.

So that ratio holds, therefore the eigenvector is proportional to [cot(theta/2), 1].

But we need to normalize this vector. Let's see.

The vector is [cot(theta/2), 1]. Its magnitude squared is cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2) since 1 + cot²(x) = csc²(x)

Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(csc²(theta/2)) = sin(theta/2)

Wait, no. The magnitude is sqrt( [cot²(theta/2) + 1] ) = sqrt(csc²(theta/2)) = |csc(theta/2)| = 1/|sin(theta/2)|. But since theta is between 0 and pi (as it's the polar angle in the x-z plane), theta/2 is between 0 and pi/2, so sin(theta/2) is positive, hence we can drop the absolute value.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is sin(theta/2) * [cot(theta/2), 1]^T = [ sin(theta/2) cot(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

But sin(theta/2) cot(theta/2) = sin(theta/2) * [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] = cos(theta/2)

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

Wait, that's beautiful! Because cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), and when we multiply by sin(theta/2), we get cos(theta/2).

Therefore, the components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Let me check this normalization:

sqrt( |cos(theta/2)|² + |sin(theta/2)|² ) = sqrt( cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) = sqrt(1) = 1.

Good, so normalized.

Wait a second, so that was straightforward? Let me see.

Wait, in the initial step, we assumed the ratio a/b = cot(theta/2). Then the eigenvector up to a constant is [cot(theta/2), 1]. Then we normalized it by multiplying by sin(theta/2), leading to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Alternatively, let's consider unit vectors in spherical coordinates. In spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of the spin operator in the direction n= (sinθ, 0, cosθ) are given by:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |-z>

But since in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the azimuthal angle phi is 0, which means the exponential term e^{i phi} is 1. So the eigenvector should be:

cos(theta/2) |+z> + sin(theta/2) |-z> ?

Wait, no, the standard spin coherent state in direction (theta, phi=0) is:

|n> = cos(theta/2) |+> + e^{i*phi} sin(theta/2) |->

since phi=0, it becomes cos(theta/2) |+> + sin(theta/2)|->. But depending on the basis. If the basis is the eigenstates of S_z, which are |+z> and |-z> with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2. If we write them as basis vectors, then |+z> is [1, 0]^T and |-z> is [0, 1]^T. Then the eigenvector for the direction n in x-z plane would be:

cos(theta/2) [1, 0] + sin(theta/2) [0, 1] ?

Wait, that gives [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is the same result I obtained earlier.

But in the problem statement, do they define the spin operator in the direction n with eigenvalue +ħ/2, so the eigenvector representing spin-up in the n direction should indeed be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T if we are using the z-basis.

Alternatively, perhaps my result is correct.

But let me check it for a specific theta. For example, when theta=0, the direction n is along z. Then, the eigenvector should be [1, 0]^T.

From [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], with theta=0, we get [1, 0]^T. Correct.

If theta=pi, direction is along negative z-axis. Then, [cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2)]^T = [0,1]^T. Which is |-z>. But according to the eigenvalue equation, since along -z direction, the spin-up (+ħ/2) would actually correspond to |-z>, which is [0,1]^T, but theta=pi:

Wait, if theta=pi, direction n is along -z, but our model here gives [cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2)] = [0,1], which is the |-z> state. However, the eigenvalue in the direction -z (operator P·n being -P_z), but n pointing along -z would be n=(0,0,-1), so P·n= P_z*(-1). So -P_z. Then the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 would actually satisfy -P_z |psi> = ħ/2 |psi>. Which is P_z |psi> = -ħ/2 |psi>, which has solution [0,1]^T. So this is consistent. If the the direction is along -z, then the spin up along n (which is -z) is the [0,1]^T. That's correct. Similarly, for theta=pi/2, direction along x-axis. Then n=(1,0,0). Then the eigenvector would be [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)]^T = [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]^T, which is the eigenvector for S_x with eigenvalue +1/2, which is correct. Because S_x eigenstates are (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2), so [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^T. Which equals [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)]^T. Correct.

Therefore, the general normalized eigenvector for spin-up in direction n (theta in x-z plane) is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. 

But wait, the problem statement says that n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So theta is arbitrary.

Therefore, the answer is components: first element cos(theta/2), second element sin(theta/2). This should be the normalized eigenvector. Therefore, the elements are \boxed{\cos(\theta/2)} and \boxed{\sin(\theta/2)}. But wait, the problem isn't asking for expressions in terms of theta, but possibly more concrete if they want? Wait, the problem is phrased:

"What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"

Given that n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So, the solution should be written in terms of theta, since it is arbitrary. Therefore, expressing the elements as cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Alternatively, sometimes eigenvectors can be written using tan(theta/2) or other forms. Wait, there might be a different parametrization. Let me check the algebra again.

Wait, earlier steps, we derived [a, b]^T proportional to [cot(theta/2), 1]^T, but normalized gives [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. Perhaps passing through that step. Alternatively, there's another approach.

Alternatively, the spin operator in direction n is (n_x S_x + n_z S_z). Then, find eigenvector with eigenvalue +1/2 for which they multiply by ħ/2. So in h/2 units. Then, the matrix for S·n is n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z, where sigma_x and sigma_z are Pauli matrices. Wait, but we need to check if the eigenvalue is +1/2 or +ħ/2. Since the spin matrices are (ħ/2)*sigma, then the eigenvalue is (ħ/2)*lambda. So to have eigenvalue +ħ/2, lambda must be +1. Therefore, our eigenvalue equation would be (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z)|v> = |v>.

So rho is theta in x-z plane, n_x = sin(theta), n_z=cos(theta)

So: [sin(theta) sigma_x + cos(theta) sigma_z ] |v> = |v>

So substituting sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]], so the matrix becomes:

sin(theta) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos(theta)[[1,0],[0,-1]] =

[[cos(theta), sin(theta)], [sin(theta), -cos(theta)]]

This is the same matrix as before. Then, [a; b] must satisfy:

cos(theta) a + sin(theta) b = a

sin(theta) a - cos(theta) b = b

This is as earlier. So, leads to same ratio a/b = cot(theta/2). Normalizing gives [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)], since:

Since a = cot(theta/2) b, then the vector is [cot(theta/2), 1]^T. Normalizing: 1 / sqrt(1 + cot²(theta/2)) * [cot(theta/2), 1]^T = [cot(theta/2)/csc(theta/2),1/csc(theta/2)]^T = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Alternatively, 1 / sqrt(cot^2(theta/2)+1) is sin(theta/2), so yes, [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Alternatively, accept that the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T in the standard basis.

Alternatively, maybe written in terms of signs depending on the components. Wait, let me confirm with another reference. According to quantum mechanics textbooks, the eigenstates of the spin operator in the direction given by spherical angles theta and phi is:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |+> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) |-> 

But since in our case, phi=0 because the direction is in x-z plane. So |+n> becomes cos(theta/2)|+> + sin(theta/2) |->. If the basis states |+> and |-> correspond to the eigenvectors of S_z, then the components would be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], as our earlier conclusion. Thus, all checks confirm that the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which form a normalized eigenvector.

Given that the problem is general, and the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so theta could be any angle, so the final answer for the eigenvector components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), normalized.

But wait, to confirm, we can use a standard Pauli matrix approach. Let’s recall that for any unit vector n, the eigenvectors of σ·n with eigenvalue +1 are given by:

[cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]

Here, phi=0, so it reduces to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], so all of this confirms that the result is correct.

Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Thus, the answer should be displayed as a vector with these elements. However, probably the problem expects the answer in terms of theta as a parameter, given that the direction is arbitrary. So they want the answer expressed in terms of the angle theta defining the direction in the x-z plane.

But in the problem statement, the x-z plane is specified, but no particular angle is given, so muon is any direction in x-z. So I guess indeed the answer is cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the thought process arrived at the final answer via two different approaches, so confident it's correct.

**Final Answer**
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} and \boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z look like. The problem statement gives them as:

P_x is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

Since the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. So, the direction vector n can be written in spherical coordinates or just in terms of angles. But since it's in the x-z plane, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is 0 because it's in the x-z plane. Therefore, the components of n should be (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So, the operator P in the direction n would be the projection of the spin components onto n. Since n is in the x-z plane, the operator P·n would be P_x*sinθ + P_z*cosθ, right? Because there's no P_y component here.

Let me write that out. The operator P·n is (sinθ * P_x) + (cosθ * P_z). Substituting P_x and P_z:

P·n = (ħ/2) [sinθ * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]]

Let me compute that matrix. So, multiply sinθ into the first matrix and cosθ into the second:

First matrix component-wise: sinθ*0, sinθ*1; sinθ*1, sinθ*0 => [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
Second matrix component-wise: cosθ*1, cosθ*0; cosθ*0, cosθ*(-1) => [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together:

[[0 + cosθ, sinθ + 0], [sinθ + 0, 0 + (-cosθ)]]
= [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

But remember, this is multiplied by ħ/2. So the total operator P·n is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. However, eigenvalues for spin operators (like spin-1/2 systems) are typically ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

So, substituting our matrix, the eigenvalue equation becomes:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2, which gives:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] |ψ> = |ψ>

Let me denote the eigenvector |ψ> as a column vector [a, b]^T. Then the equation becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ]   [a]   = [a]
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [b]     [b]

So expanding this, the first row gives: cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
The second row gives: sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write those equations:

1. cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2. sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me rearrange both equations to bring all terms to one side:

1. (cosθ - 1) * a + sinθ * b = 0
2. sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

So we have a system of linear equations:

[(cosθ - 1)    sinθ      ] [a]   = [0]
[ sinθ       -(cosθ + 1) ] [b]     [0]

To find non-trivial solutions (since eigenvectors cannot be the zero vector), the determinant of the coefficient matrix should be zero. But we already know this is an eigenvalue problem, so the determinant is zero because we're looking for eigenvectors. Hence, we can solve for a and b.

From the first equation: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

Let me express a in terms of b, or vice versa. Let's solve for a:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b

=> a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] * b

Similarly, from the second equation:

sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

=> sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b

=> a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] * b

So now we have two expressions for a in terms of b:

From first equation: a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] * b

From second equation: a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] * b

Therefore, these two expressions must be equal:

- sinθ / (cosθ - 1)

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. First, I'll recall the matrix forms of the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z as provided:

P_x = (ħ/2)[[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2)[[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Since the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. Using spherical coordinates, with θ representing the polar angle from the z-axis and φ = 0 (since we're in the x-z plane), the components of n are (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

The operator P in direction n is the projection of spin components onto n, which gives P·n = P_x*sinθ + P_z*cosθ, as there's no P_y component.

Expanding this:
P·n = (ħ/2)[sinθ*[[0, 1], [1, 0]] + cosθ*[[1, 0], [0, -1]]]

Computing the matrix multiplication:
First term: sinθ*[[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
Second term: cosθ*[[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these matrices:
[[0+cosθ, sinθ+0], [sinθ+0, 0+(-cosθ)]] = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Therefore, P·n = (ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Now I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. The eigenvalue equation is:
(P·n)|ψ⟩ = (ħ/2)|ψ⟩

Substituting our matrix and dividing both sides by ħ/2:
[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩

If I represent |ψ⟩ as [a, b]^T, the equation becomes:
[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]][a, b]^T = [a, b]^T

Expanding this into two equations:
1. cosθ*a + sinθ*b = a
2. sinθ*a - cosθ*b = b

Rearranging to standard form:
1. (cosθ-1)*a + sinθ*b = 0
2. sinθ*a - (cosθ+1)*b = 0

This gives us a system of linear equations:
[(cosθ-1), sinθ; sinθ, -(cosθ+1)][a, b]^T = [0, 0]^T

From the first equation, I can express a in terms of b:
a = [-sinθ/(cosθ-1)]*b

From the second equation:
a = [(cosθ+1)/sinθ]*b

These two expressions for a must be equal:
-sinθ/(cosθ-1) = (cosθ+1)/sinθ

Alright, I need to determine the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P associated with a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, where the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Let's start by recalling the representations of the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z, which are provided as:

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

Since the direction vector n resides in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero. Consequently, in spherical coordinates or using angles, the vector n is represented with the polar angle θ measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is 0 because it lies in the x-z plane. Hence, the components of n are (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Therefore, the operator P oriented along n is the projection of the spin components onto n. Given that n is in the x-z plane, P·n is given by P_x*sinθ + P_z*cosθ. Since P_y doesn't play a role here, let's express this. The operator P·n equals (sinθ * P_x) + (cosθ * P_z). Substituting P_x and P_z: 

P·n = (ħ/2) [sinθ * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + cosθ * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]]

Let's calculate that matrix. First combine sinθ with the first matrix and cosθ with the second:

For the first matrix: sinθ*0, sinθ*1; sinθ*1, sinθ*0 results in [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
For the second matrix: cosθ*1, cosθ*0; cosθ*0, cosθ*(-1) leads to [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Add them together:

[[0 + cosθ, sinθ + 0], [sinθ + 0, 0 + (-cosθ)]]
= [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Keeping in mind this is scaled by ħ/2, the total operator P·n amounts to (ħ/2) times the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Now we seek the eigenvector that corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Typically, for spin operators in spin-1/2 systems, eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, so the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Substitute our matrix, yielding:

(ħ/2) [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Dividing through by ħ/2 simplifies it to:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] |ψ> = |ψ>

Let the eigenvector |ψ> be a column vector [a, b]^T. Then the equation becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ]   [a]   = [a]
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ] [b]     [b]

Expanding gives these equations:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Rearrange to bring all terms together:

1. (cosθ - 1) * a + sinθ * b = 0
2. sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

This system of equations is:

[(cosθ - 1)    sinθ      ] [a]   = [0]
[ sinθ       -(cosθ + 1) ] [b]     [0]

To find solutions beyond the trivial one, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero, as expected for an eigenvalue problem. Hence, we aim to solve for a and b.

From equation one: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

Express a in terms of b, or vice versa. Solving for a:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b

=> a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] * b

Now from the second equation:

sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

=> sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b

=> a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] * b

We now have two expressions for a related to b:

From the first equation: a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] * b

From the second equation: a = [ (cosθ + 1) / sinθ ] * b

Thus, equating these two gives:

- sinθ / (cosθ - 1)

Therefore, the two equations are consistent, so we can proceed with any of the expressions for a in terms of b.\n\nLet me choose one of them. Let\'s take the first one:\n\na = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] * b\n\nBut perhaps it\'s better to notice that cosθ - 1 can be written as -2 sin²(θ/2) using the double-angle identity. Similarly, sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Similarly, cosθ + 1 is 2 cos²(θ/2).\n\nAlternatively, let me manipulate the denominator:\n\ncosθ - 1 = - (1 - cosθ)\n\nWhich is -2 sin²(θ/2)\n\nSimilarly, let\'s write that:\n\na = [ - sinθ / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ] * b\n= [ sinθ / (2 sin²θ/2) ] * b\n\nBut sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Therefore:\n\na = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ] * b\n= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b\n= cot(θ/2) * b\n\nSimilarly, from the other equation:\n\na = [ (cosθ + 1)/ sinθ ] * b\n\nBut cosθ + 1 = 2 cos²(θ/2), so:\n\na = [ 2 cos²(θ/2) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ] * b\n= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b\n= cot(θ/2) * b\n\nSame result. So a / b = cot(θ/2). Therefore, we can set b = some constant, say b = 1, then a = cot(θ/2). But we need the eigenvector normalized, so we must find the normalization constant.\n\nLet me take the eigenvector as [a, b]^T where a = cot(θ/2) * b. Then, to normalize, the vector\'s magnitude squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 (cot²(θ/2) + 1 )\n\nBut cot²(x) + 1 = csc²(x), so this becomes |b|^2 * csc²(θ/2) = 1\n\nTherefore, |b| = sin(θ/2). Choosing b to be real and positive for simplicity (since the overall phase doesn\'t matter), we have b = sin(θ/2), so then a = cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).\n\nHence, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.\n\nWait, that\'s similar to spin-up eigenstates for spin-1/2 particles along a general direction. Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s recall that for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstate of the spin operator along a direction given by polar angles θ and φ is:\n\n|ψ> = e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2) |+> + e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) |->\n\nBut in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ = 0. Therefore, the eigenvector becomes:\n\ncos(θ/2) |+> + sin(θ/2) |->\n\nWhich, in the eigenbasis of S_z (since |+> is spin-up along z and |-> is spin-down), would correspond to components:\n\n[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.\n\nSo that\'s consistent with what we derived algebraically. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].\n\nBut let me verify this.\n\nSuppose θ is the angle from the z-axis. Then, when θ=0, the direction is along +z, and the eigenvector is [1, 0], which makes sense. If θ=π (180 degrees), then [cos(π/2), sin(π/2)] = [0,1], but θ=π is along the -z direction, which is spin-down, but we are looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, that might seem contradictory.\n\nWait, but in our case, the operator P·n when θ = π is pointing in the -z direction. So we have:\n\nP·n = (ħ/2) [[cosπ, sinπ], [sinπ, -cosπ]] = (ħ/2) [[-1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nEigenvalue equation for eigenvalue ħ/2 would be:\n\n[[-1, 0], [0, 1]] [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T\n\nWhich gives -a = a and b = b, implying a = 0, and b is arbitrary. So eigenvector is [0, b]. After normalization, [0, 1], which is consistent with θ=π leading to eigenvector [0,1], which is spin-down in the z-direction. But spin-down is eigenvalue -ħ/2. Wait, here, the eigenvalue equation has eigenvalue +ħ/2. That would be inconsistent.\n\nWait, seems like a conflict here. When θ=π, the operator P·n is pointing along -z. Then, the eigenvalues for P·n should be ±ħ/2. But if we compute, the matrix [[-1, 0], [0, 1]] has eigenvalues -1 and 1 multiplied by ħ/2, so -ħ/2 and +ħ/2. Therefore, if we are looking for the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2 when θ=π, then it\'s [0,1], which corresponds to spin-down in the original z basis. So this actually gives the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for P·n when n is along -z. That makes sense because if you measure the spin along -z direction, the spin-down state in the original z basis is spin-up in the -z direction. So actually, in this case, [0,1] is the eigenvector for +ħ/2 when measuring along -z. So that is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if θ=0, P·n is along +z, matrix [[1, 0],[0, -1]], eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 is [1,0], as expected.\n\nTherefore, our derived eigenvector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] would correspond to the correct state for all θ.\n\nBut wait, when θ=π/2, n is along +x direction. Then θ/2 = π/4. So cos(π/4)=√2/2, sin(π/4)=√2/2. Therefore, eigenvector is [√2/2, √2/2]^T. Let\'s verify.\n\nFor θ=π/2, P·n is (ħ/2)* [[0,1],[1,0]] which is P_x. The eigenvectors of P_x are known to be [1,1] and [1,-1] with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Normalized, they are [1/√2, 1/√2] and [1/√2, -1/√2]. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to [1/√2, 1/√2], which matches our result. Thus, seems correct.\n\nSo in general, the normalized eigenvector for the operator P·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. However, hold on, wait a minute—if θ is defined as the polar angle from the z-axis, but the vector is in the x-z plane, so yes, that\'s consistent. However, maybe θ is actually the angle between n and the x-axis? Wait, in the x-z plane, the usual spherical coordinates have θ as the polar angle from the z-axis and φ=0.\n\nBut in any case, according to the setup, n is along x-z plane, with spherical coordinates (r=1, θ, φ=0). Therefore, n_x = sinθ, n_y=0, n_z=cosθ. So that component is correct.\n\nThus, given that, yes, the eigenvector should be [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to parametrize it differently?\n\nBut let\'s see. When θ=0, along z, eigenvector is [1,0], when θ=π/2, eigenvector is [cos(π/4), sin(π/4)] = [√2/2, √2/2], and when θ=π, it\'s [0,1]. All checks out. This appears to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But θ is arbitrary here. However, the problem statement asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector for an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So in terms of θ, the angle from the z-axis, that\'s the answer.\n\nBut does the problem want the answer in terms of θ, or written out in terms of the components of n? Since n is arbitrary, maybe they want it in terms of θ. The problem says "along an arbitrary direction n".\n\nAlternatively, maybe to present the answer in terms of n\'s coordinates.\n\nLet me check the problem statement again: "Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2."\n\nTherefore, they might want the eigenvector expressed in terms of the components of n. Since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, it can be parametrized as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So they may want the answer in terms of sinθ and cosθ, but the answer I have [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] is already in terms of θ. However, maybe they want it written in terms of sinθ and cosθ?\n\nAlternatively, converting θ/2 identities. Maybe use double-angle formulas. Since cos(θ/2) = √[(1 + cosθ)/2], and sin(θ/2) = √[(1 - cosθ)/2]\n\nBut since we\'re working with vectors in the x-z plane, maybe parametrizing the eigenvector components in terms of nx and nz?\n\nNote that n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So we can express cos(θ/2) as √[(1 + cosθ)/2] = √[(1 + n_z)/2], and sin(θ/2) = √[(1 - cosθ)/2] = √[(1 - n_z)/2].\n\nTherefore, perhaps expressing the eigenvector as:\n\n[√( (1 + n_z)/2 ), √( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nBut since n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ, and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So if we need to express in terms of n_x and n_z, that\'s possible.\n\nAlternatively, using tan(θ/2) formulas. Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Now, express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_z.\n\nSince cosθ = n_z, then cos(θ/2) = √[(1 + n_z)/2]\n\nSimilarly, sin(θ/2) = √[(1 - n_z)/2].\n\nBut for the components, we can write the eigenvector as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T\n\nAlternatively, if we also want to incorporate n_x, since n_x = sinθ, we can note that sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2 * sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2] * sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] = sqrt(1 - n_z²) ) = sqrt(n_x² + n_y² + n_z² - n_z²) ) = sqrt(n_x²) = |n_x|. But since θ is between 0 and π, n_x = sinθ is non-negative. So n_x = sinθ.\n\nBut then, how would we write sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) in terms of n_x and n_z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s acceptable to leave the answer in terms of θ, since the problem states "an arbitrary direction n" lying in the x-z plane, so if we parametrize by θ, it\'s acceptable. However, maybe express it in terms of the components of n, but in that case, since it\'s in x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, so θ can be expressed in terms of n_x and n_z. But they are connected by sin²θ + cos²θ =1.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes eigenvectors for such spin states are expressed in terms of the direction\'s components, but transformed via angle halving.\n\nBut let me check.\n\nIf the direction is n = (n_x, 0, n_z), then the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].\n\nGiven that n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.\n\nTherefore, we can write cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, substituting n_z:\n\ncos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), which is in terms of n_z only.\n\nAlternatively, we can perhaps use trigonometric identities to relate θ/2 to n_x and n_z. But I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps present the answer as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], with the note that θ is the angle between n and the z-axis. However, since the problem is asking for "the elements of the normalized eigenvector," it\'s likely they expect an expression in terms of theta, given that the direction is arbitrary.\n\nBut the problem may not want theta in the answer, perhaps. Since theta is a parameter, but they just want the elements, so either written in terms of theta or in terms of angle theta. Wait, the problem says "arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", but doesn\'t specify if the answer should be in terms of theta or in another form.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem statement:\n\n"Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P ... corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2."\n\n"What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"\n\nThey don\'t specify parameterizing it in terms of theta. Hmm. But how else? Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the answer has to include variables for the components. However, maybe they want it in terms of the components of the vector n. So since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, we can write n = (a, 0, b) with a² + b² =1.\n\nThen, the components of the eigenvector would be written in terms of a and b?\n\nFrom our previous analysis, theta is such that a = sinθ, b = cosθ. Therefore, using a = sinθ and b = cosθ, we can express cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) in terms of a and b.\n\nAlternatively, since a = sinθ, theta = arcsin(a), but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, since cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + b)/2 ) and sin(theta/2)= sqrt( (1 - b)/2 ), using b = cosθ.\n\nTherefore, with n = (a, 0, b), a² + b² =1, the normalized eigenvector components are:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 + b)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - b)/2 ) ]\n\nSo written in terms of the components of n. Since a = sqrt(1 - b²), but maybe they just leave it in terms of b. But the question is using the direction vector n, but are we allowed to reference n in the answer?\n\nWait, the problem says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?".\n\nThe problem doesn\'t specify coordinates, just that the direction n is in the x-z plane. Maybe they just need the eigenvector in terms of theta? For example: [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]. However, theta is not mentioned in the problem, so it\'s probably introduced by me. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in spherical coordinates?\n\nWait, but let\'s recall that these eigenvectors are spin coherent states. So for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstate of the spin operator along direction n (theta, phi=0) is:\n\n|n> = cos(theta/2) |+> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|->. Since phi=0, then |n> = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.\n\nTherefore, the answer is of that form. Since the direction is in x-z plane (phi=0), the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So in the standard basis (eigenbasis of S_z), the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].\n\nTherefore, since theta is defined as the polar angle from the z-axis, the answer depends on theta, but theta is determined by the direction n. Since the problem didn\'t specify a particular direction, just an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, the answer must be given in terms of theta, or in terms of n\'s components.\n\nSince n\'s components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ), as I mentioned earlier. To write the eigenvector in terms of n_z = cosθ, using theta/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the answer in terms of sin(theta) and cos(theta), but I don\'t think that would simplify.\n\nLet me see. Can this be written another way? For example:\n\ncos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) and sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 )\n\nTherefore, in terms of cosθ. But cosθ is n_z. So then, the eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nAlternatively, sin(theta/2) in terms of n_x. Since n_x = sinθ, and sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ), we can relate sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) and similarly. Therefore, writing components as [ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T, which is equivalent.\n\nThat might be a better answer, in terms of n_z. Alternatively, is there a way to include n_x as well? Since the problem mentions a direction vector n, which has components in x and z. However, since in x-z plane, n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²). Maybe it\'s redundant. But since the problem said "arbitrary direction," but gives that it\'s along the x-z plane, so perhaps the answer can be given just in terms of the angle theta from z-axis, but problem didn\'t mention theta. So maybe in terms of components of n.\n\nHence, perhaps expressing the answer as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut given that in the problem statement, they may prefer theta. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe since the operator given is of the form like sigma matrices (Pauli matrices), which for spin-1/2 systems. Then, the eigenvectors are in standard form. Indeed, for a direction n in polar coordinates (theta, 0), the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]\n\nTherefore, the answer is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. But since problem statement might need answer in terms of matrices? Wait, no, eigenvectors are vectors. The question says, "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"\n\nHowever, they didn\'t specify it in terms of a given parametrization. Therefore, unless theta is defined problem-specifically, which it is not. Wait, they say "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So, since it\'s an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, perhaps the answer should be written in terms of n?\n\nBut without any further parametrization, unless angle theta is defined as the angle between n and z-axis. Which is the standard definition.\n\nAssuming that, theta is introduced as the angle from z-axis, then [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] would be acceptable, and the answer is \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix} }\n\nAlternatively, expressed in terms of theta.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes, eigenvectors can be written in terms of Euler angles or direction cosines.\n\nHowever, considering the problem mentions "arbitrary direction n", but if no parameters are given, perhaps the answer is expected in terms of cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). But considering the problem gives P as composed of Pauli matrices, which in standard basis are represented as:\n\nsigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nsigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\nsigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nThus, the operator P is (ħ/2) multiplying the Pauli matrices. Therefore, since the eigenstate for (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z) with eigenvalue +1 is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)] but in our case phi=0 because the direction is in x-z plane (y-component zero). Therefore, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, as phi=0.\n\nTherefore, according to standard quantum mechanics results, the normalized eigenvector elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So I should write down that.\n\nSince the problem asks for the elements, the answer is:\n\nFirst element: cos(theta/2)\n\nSecond element: sin(theta/2)\n\nBut to write them boxed? Since the problem specifies "elements of the normalized eigenvector," so as a vector. However, for the purposes of answering, they might expect in matrix form with each element boxed. But according to the history of such questions, usually, in spin-1/2 system, the eigenvectors are well-known.

To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by considering the components of the operator \(\vec{P}\):

- \(P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
- \(P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
- \(P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}\)

Given the direction \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, we parameterize \(\vec{n}\) as \((\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the z-axis. The operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) is then:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \sin\theta \cdot P_x + \cos\theta \cdot P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right)
\]

Simplifying this matrix, we get:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). This leads to solving the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This results in the system of equations:

1. \((\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0\)
2. \(\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0\)

Solving these equations, we find that \(a = \cot(\theta/2) b\). Normalizing the eigenvector, we use trigonometric identities to express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(\theta\). The normalized eigenvector is found to be:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

= (cosθ + 1)/ sinθ

Multiply both sides by (cosθ - 1) and sinθ to eliminate denominators:

- sin²θ = (cosθ + 1)(cosθ - 1)

But (cosθ + 1)(cosθ - 1) = cos²θ - 1 = - sin²θ

Therefore,

- sin²θ = - sin²θ

Which simplifies to 0 = 0, which is an identity. Therefore, the two equations are consistent, so we can proceed with any of the expressions for a in terms of b.

Let me choose one of them. Let's take the first one:

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] * b

But perhaps it's better to notice that cosθ - 1 can be written as -2 sin²(θ/2) using the double-angle identity. Similarly, sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Similarly, cosθ + 1 is 2 cos²(θ/2).

Alternatively, let me manipulate the denominator:

cosθ - 1 = - (1 - cosθ)

Which is -2 sin²(θ/2)

Similarly, let's write that:

a = [ - sinθ / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ] * b
= [ sinθ / (2 sin²θ/2) ] * b

But sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Therefore:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 sin²(θ/2)) ] * b
= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b
= cot(θ/2) * b

Similarly, from the other equation:

a = [ (cosθ + 1)/ sinθ ] * b

But cosθ + 1 = 2 cos²(θ/2), so:

a = [ 2 cos²(θ/2) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ] * b
= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b
= cot(θ/2) * b

Same result. So a / b = cot(θ/2). Therefore, we can set b = some constant, say b = 1, then a = cot(θ/2). But we need the eigenvector normalized, so we must find the normalization constant.

Let me take the eigenvector as [a, b]^T where a = cot(θ/2) * b. Then, to normalize, the vector's magnitude squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 (cot²(θ/2) + 1 )

But cot²(x) + 1 = csc²(x), so this becomes |b|^2 * csc²(θ/2) = 1

Therefore, |b| = sin(θ/2). Choosing b to be real and positive for simplicity (since the overall phase doesn't matter), we have b = sin(θ/2), so then a = cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) = cos(θ/2).

Hence, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

Wait, that's similar to spin-up eigenstates for spin-1/2 particles along a general direction. Let me check that.

Alternatively, let's recall that for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstate of the spin operator along a direction given by polar angles θ and φ is:

|ψ> = e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2) |+> + e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) |->

But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ = 0. Therefore, the eigenvector becomes:

cos(θ/2) |+> + sin(θ/2) |->

Which, in the eigenbasis of S_z (since |+> is spin-up along z and |-> is spin-down), would correspond to components:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

So that's consistent with what we derived algebraically. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But let me verify this.

Suppose θ is the angle from the z-axis. Then, when θ=0, the direction is along +z, and the eigenvector is [1, 0], which makes sense. If θ=π (180 degrees), then [cos(π/2), sin(π/2)] = [0,1], but θ=π is along the -z direction, which is spin-down, but we are looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, that might seem contradictory.

Wait, but in our case, the operator P·n when θ = π is pointing in the -z direction. So we have:

P·n = (ħ/2) [[cosπ, sinπ], [sinπ, -cosπ]] = (ħ/2) [[-1, 0], [0, 1]]

Eigenvalue equation for eigenvalue ħ/2 would be:

[[-1, 0], [0, 1]] [a, b]^T = [a, b]^T

Which gives -a = a and b = b, implying a = 0, and b is arbitrary. So eigenvector is [0, b]. After normalization, [0, 1], which is consistent with θ=π leading to eigenvector [0,1], which is spin-down in the z-direction. But spin-down is eigenvalue -ħ/2. Wait, here, the eigenvalue equation has eigenvalue +ħ/2. That would be inconsistent.

Wait, seems like a conflict here. When θ=π, the operator P·n is pointing along -z. Then, the eigenvalues for P·n should be ±ħ/2. But if we compute, the matrix [[-1, 0], [0, 1]] has eigenvalues -1 and 1 multiplied by ħ/2, so -ħ/2 and +ħ/2. Therefore, if we are looking for the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2 when θ=π, then it's [0,1], which corresponds to spin-down in the original z basis. So this actually gives the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for P·n when n is along -z. That makes sense because if you measure the spin along -z direction, the spin-down state in the original z basis is spin-up in the -z direction. So actually, in this case, [0,1] is the eigenvector for +ħ/2 when measuring along -z. So that is correct.

Similarly, if θ=0, P·n is along +z, matrix [[1, 0],[0, -1]], eigenvalues ±ħ/2. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 is [1,0], as expected.

Therefore, our derived eigenvector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] would correspond to the correct state for all θ.

But wait, when θ=π/2, n is along +x direction. Then θ/2 = π/4. So cos(π/4)=√2/2, sin(π/4)=√2/2. Therefore, eigenvector is [√2/2, √2/2]^T. Let's verify.

For θ=π/2, P·n is (ħ/2)* [[0,1],[1,0]] which is P_x. The eigenvectors of P_x are known to be [1,1] and [1,-1] with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Normalized, they are [1/√2, 1/√2] and [1/√2, -1/√2]. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to [1/√2, 1/√2], which matches our result. Thus, seems correct.

So in general, the normalized eigenvector for the operator P·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T. However, hold on, wait a minute—if θ is defined as the polar angle from the z-axis, but the vector is in the x-z plane, so yes, that's consistent. However, maybe θ is actually the angle between n and the x-axis? Wait, in the x-z plane, the usual spherical coordinates have θ as the polar angle from the z-axis and φ=0.

But in any case, according to the setup, n is along x-z plane, with spherical coordinates (r=1, θ, φ=0). Therefore, n_x = sinθ, n_y=0, n_z=cosθ. So that component is correct.

Thus, given that, yes, the eigenvector should be [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

Wait, but perhaps I need to parametrize it differently?

But let's see. When θ=0, along z, eigenvector is [1,0], when θ=π/2, eigenvector is [cos(π/4), sin(π/4)] = [√2/2, √2/2], and when θ=π, it's [0,1]. All checks out. This appears to be correct.

Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2). But θ is arbitrary here. However, the problem statement asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector for an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So in terms of θ, the angle from the z-axis, that's the answer.

But does the problem want the answer in terms of θ, or written out in terms of the components of n? Since n is arbitrary, maybe they want it in terms of θ. The problem says "along an arbitrary direction n".

Alternatively, maybe to present the answer in terms of n's coordinates.

Let me check the problem statement again: "Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2."

Therefore, they might want the eigenvector expressed in terms of the components of n. Since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, it can be parametrized as n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So they may want the answer in terms of sinθ and cosθ, but the answer I have [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] is already in terms of θ. However, maybe they want it written in terms of sinθ and cosθ?

Alternatively, converting θ/2 identities. Maybe use double-angle formulas. Since cos(θ/2) = √[(1 + cosθ)/2], and sin(θ/2) = √[(1 - cosθ)/2]

But since we're working with vectors in the x-z plane, maybe parametrizing the eigenvector components in terms of nx and nz?

Note that n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So we can express cos(θ/2) as √[(1 + cosθ)/2] = √[(1 + n_z)/2], and sin(θ/2) = √[(1 - cosθ)/2] = √[(1 - n_z)/2].

Therefore, perhaps expressing the eigenvector as:

[√( (1 + n_z)/2 ), √( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T

But since n_x = sinθ, and n_z = cosθ, and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So if we need to express in terms of n_x and n_z, that's possible.

Alternatively, using tan(θ/2) formulas. Maybe.

Alternatively, noticing that since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Now, express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_z.

Since cosθ = n_z, then cos(θ/2) = √[(1 + n_z)/2]

Similarly, sin(θ/2) = √[(1 - n_z)/2].

But for the components, we can write the eigenvector as:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T

Alternatively, if we also want to incorporate n_x, since n_x = sinθ, we can note that sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2 * sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2] * sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] = sqrt(1 - n_z²) ) = sqrt(n_x² + n_y² + n_z² - n_z²) ) = sqrt(n_x²) = |n_x|. But since θ is between 0 and π, n_x = sinθ is non-negative. So n_x = sinθ.

But then, how would we write sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) in terms of n_x and n_z.

Alternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to leave the answer in terms of θ, since the problem states "an arbitrary direction n" lying in the x-z plane, so if we parametrize by θ, it's acceptable. However, maybe express it in terms of the components of n, but in that case, since it's in x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, so θ can be expressed in terms of n_x and n_z. But they are connected by sin²θ + cos²θ =1.

Alternatively, sometimes eigenvectors for such spin states are expressed in terms of the direction's components, but transformed via angle halving.

But let me check.

If the direction is n = (n_x, 0, n_z), then the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Given that n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Therefore, we can write cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

Therefore, substituting n_z:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), which is in terms of n_z only.

Alternatively, we can perhaps use trigonometric identities to relate θ/2 to n_x and n_z. But I might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps present the answer as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], with the note that θ is the angle between n and the z-axis. However, since the problem is asking for "the elements of the normalized eigenvector," it's likely they expect an expression in terms of theta, given that the direction is arbitrary.

But the problem may not want theta in the answer, perhaps. Since theta is a parameter, but they just want the elements, so either written in terms of theta or in terms of angle theta. Wait, the problem says "arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", but doesn't specify if the answer should be in terms of theta or in another form.

Wait, re-reading the problem statement:

"Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P ... corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2."

"What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"

They don't specify parameterizing it in terms of theta. Hmm. But how else? Since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the answer has to include variables for the components. However, maybe they want it in terms of the components of the vector n. So since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, we can write n = (a, 0, b) with a² + b² =1.

Then, the components of the eigenvector would be written in terms of a and b?

From our previous analysis, theta is such that a = sinθ, b = cosθ. Therefore, using a = sinθ and b = cosθ, we can express cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) in terms of a and b.

Alternatively, since a = sinθ, theta = arcsin(a), but that might not help.

Alternatively, since cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + b)/2 ) and sin(theta/2)= sqrt( (1 - b)/2 ), using b = cosθ.

Therefore, with n = (a, 0, b), a² + b² =1, the normalized eigenvector components are:

[ sqrt( (1 + b)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - b)/2 ) ]

So written in terms of the components of n. Since a = sqrt(1 - b²), but maybe they just leave it in terms of b. But the question is using the direction vector n, but are we allowed to reference n in the answer?

Wait, the problem says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?".

The problem doesn't specify coordinates, just that the direction n is in the x-z plane. Maybe they just need the eigenvector in terms of theta? For example: [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]. However, theta is not mentioned in the problem, so it's probably introduced by me. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in spherical coordinates?

Wait, but let's recall that these eigenvectors are spin coherent states. So for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstate of the spin operator along direction n (theta, phi=0) is:

|n> = cos(theta/2) |+> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|->. Since phi=0, then |n> = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Therefore, the answer is of that form. Since the direction is in x-z plane (phi=0), the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So in the standard basis (eigenbasis of S_z), the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Therefore, since theta is defined as the polar angle from the z-axis, the answer depends on theta, but theta is determined by the direction n. Since the problem didn't specify a particular direction, just an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, the answer must be given in terms of theta, or in terms of n's components.

Since n's components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ), as I mentioned earlier. To write the eigenvector in terms of n_z = cosθ, using theta/2.

Alternatively, maybe they want the answer in terms of sin(theta) and cos(theta), but I don't think that would simplify.

Let me see. Can this be written another way? For example:

cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) and sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 )

Therefore, in terms of cosθ. But cosθ is n_z. So then, the eigenvector is [ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]

Alternatively, sin(theta/2) in terms of n_x. Since n_x = sinθ, and sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ), we can relate sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) and similarly. Therefore, writing components as [ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]^T, which is equivalent.

That might be a better answer, in terms of n_z. Alternatively, is there a way to include n_x as well? Since the problem mentions a direction vector n, which has components in x and z. However, since in x-z plane, n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²). Maybe it's redundant. But since the problem said "arbitrary direction," but gives that it's along the x-z plane, so perhaps the answer can be given just in terms of the angle theta from z-axis, but problem didn't mention theta. So maybe in terms of components of n.

Hence, perhaps expressing the answer as:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]

But given that in the problem statement, they may prefer theta. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe since the operator given is of the form like sigma matrices (Pauli matrices), which for spin-1/2 systems. Then, the eigenvectors are in standard form. Indeed, for a direction n in polar coordinates (theta, 0), the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]

Therefore, the answer is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. But since problem statement might need answer in terms of matrices? Wait, no, eigenvectors are vectors. The question says, "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"

However, they didn't specify it in terms of a given parametrization. Therefore, unless theta is defined problem-specifically, which it is not. Wait, they say "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So, since it's an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, perhaps the answer should be written in terms of n?

But without any further parametrization, unless angle theta is defined as the angle between n and z-axis. Which is the standard definition.

Assuming that, theta is introduced as the angle from z-axis, then [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] would be acceptable, and the answer is \boxed{ \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix} }

Alternatively, expressed in terms of theta.

Alternatively, sometimes, eigenvectors can be written in terms of Euler angles or direction cosines.

However, considering the problem mentions "arbitrary direction n", but if no parameters are given, perhaps the answer is expected in terms of cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). But considering the problem gives P as composed of Pauli matrices, which in standard basis are represented as:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Thus, the operator P is (ħ/2) multiplying the Pauli matrices. Therefore, since the eigenstate for (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z) with eigenvalue +1 is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)] but in our case phi=0 because the direction is in x-z plane (y-component zero). Therefore, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, as phi=0.

Therefore, according to standard quantum mechanics results, the normalized eigenvector elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So I should write down that.

Since the problem asks for the elements, the answer is:

First element: cos(theta/2)

Second element: sin(theta/2)

But to write them boxed? Since the problem specifies "elements of the normalized eigenvector," so as a vector. However, for the purposes of answering, they might expect in matrix form with each element boxed. But according to the history of such questions, usually, in spin-1/2 system, the eigenvectors are well-known. So putting together,

The normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2) ]
[ sin(theta/2) ]

Therefore, boxed as:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}

Yes, this seems right. Theta here being the angle between the direction n and the z-axis.

I need to make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let's recap:

1. The operator in direction n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z).
2. Expressed matrix form: (ħ/2)(n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]])
3. Which simplifies to (ħ/2)[[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]]
4. Then, solving eigenvalue equation (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ> leads to the equations:
   n_z a + n_x b = a
   n_x a - n_z b = b
5. After rearranging, we found the eigenvectors [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] where theta is angle between n and z-axis.

All steps seem logical. Cross-check with special cases (theta=0, theta= pi/2, theta=pi) all consistent with known eigenvectors.

Thus, I feel confident that the answer is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)].

**Final Answer**
The normalized eigenvector is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}.

Then when operator is P_x, eigenstate with +ħ/2 is indeed [1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)]. Similarly.\n\nSo the calculation seems to check out.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].\n\nWait, but originally, we had normalized eigenvector as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], without complex components.

To calculate the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by expressing the components of the operator \(\vec{P}\) in the direction \(\vec{n}\). Given the matrices for \(P_x\), \(P_y\), and \(P_z\):

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, it has components \((n_x, 0, n_z)\) which can be parameterized using the polar angle \(\theta\) as \((\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\). The operator in the direction \(\vec{n}\) is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \sin\theta \cdot P_x + \cos\theta \cdot P_z
\]

Substituting the matrices for \(P_x\) and \(P_z\):

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. \(\cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = a\)
2. \(\sin\theta \cdot a - \cos\theta \cdot b = b\)

Rewriting these equations:

1. \((\cos\theta - 1) \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = 0\)
2. \(\sin\theta \cdot a - (\cos\theta + 1) \cdot b = 0\)

Solving these equations, we find that the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Normalizing this eigenvector, we use trigonometric identities and find that the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

Cross-multiplying:
-sin²θ = (cosθ+1)(cosθ-1) = cos²θ -1

But since cos²θ + sin²θ =1, cos²θ =1 - sin²θ
Thus -sin²θ = (1 - sin²θ -1) = - sin²θ → which holds true. Therefore, the equations are consistent, and the solution is valid.

Taking a = [(cosθ + 1)/sinθ ]*b. To normalize the vector, assuming b is real for simplicity (since any phase can be adjusted), then:

Let’s set b =1, then a = (cosθ +1)/sinθ.

Thus |ψ_unnormalized> = [( (cosθ +1)/sinθ ), 1]^T.

The normalization factor is sqrt( |a|² + |b|² ).

Compute the squared magnitude:

( (cosθ +1)/sinθ )² + 1 = [ (cosθ +1)^2 + sin²θ ] / sin²θ

Expanding numerator:
cos²θ + 2cosθ +1 + sin²θ = (cos²θ + sin²θ) + 2cosθ +1 = 1 + 2cosθ +1 = 2(1 + cosθ)

Therefore, normalization factor is sqrt( [2(1 + cosθ)] / sin²θ ) ) = sqrt(2(1 + cosθ))/ |sinθ|.

Using the identity 1 + cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2):

Normalization factor becomes sqrt(2*(2cos²(θ/2))) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) )

Simplify numerator: sqrt(4cos²(θ/2)) = 2|cos(θ/2)|. Denominator: 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

Assuming θ in [0, π], cos(θ/2) is non-negative, so:

Normalization factor: [2 cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ] = 1 / sin(θ/2) = csc(θ/2)

Hence, normalized vector is:

[ ( (cosθ +1)/sinθ , 1 ) ] * sin(θ/2)/sqrt(1 + cosθ).

Wait, perhaps it's better to manipulate the normalized vector.

Alternatively, let’s take normalization step again.

The normalized components should satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Using a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] b

Let’s let b = sinθ. Then a = 1 + cosθ. Then:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = (1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ) + sin²θ = 1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ + sin²θ = 2 + 2cosθ.

Thus the norm squared is 2(1 + cosθ). Therefore, normalization factor is 1 / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)).

Alternatively, using trigonometric identities:

sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) = 2cos(θ/2), since 1 + cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2).

Thus, normalization factor: 1/(2cos(θ/2)).

So normalized a and b would be:

a = (1 + cosθ)/(2 cos(θ/2) sinθ) * sinθ → Wait, maybe not. Let me adjust again.

If the unnormalized vector is [(1 + cosθ), sinθ]^T (choosing b = sinθ gives a=1 + cosθ for easy handling?), but we need to check:

Original solution for a and b was a= (1 + cosθ)/sinθ, b=1. So unnormalized vector is [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ, 1] must be multiplied by sinθ to avoid denominator, leading to [1 + cosθ, sinθ]

But then that normalizes as sqrt( (1 + cosθ)^2 + sin^2θ ) = sqrt(1 + 2cosθ + cos²θ + sin²θ ) = sqrt(2 + 2cosθ) = sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) = 2 cos(theta/2), since sqrt(2 * 2 cos^2(theta/2))) = 2|cos(theta/2)|, but theta is between 0 and pi so cos(theta/2) is positive. Therefore, normalized vector would be (1/(2 cos(theta/2))) [1 + cos theta, sin theta]

But writing 1 + cos theta as 2 cos^2(theta/2) and sin theta as 2 sin(theta/2)cos(theta/2):

Hence this becomes [2 cos²(theta/2), 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 cos(theta/2)] =

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Hence, that is the normalized eigenvector. Therefore, the components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, that’s the same as |+n⟩ eigenstate.

Alternatively, can check for particular angles, like theta=0 (along z), it should be [1,0], which with theta=0, cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0, so yes. For theta=pi (along -z), vectors should be [0,1], cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1. Wait theta=pi corresponds to n pointing along negative z. So eigenvector would be [cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2)] = [0,1]. Wait, but the eigenvalue equation for along +z is eigenvalue +ħ/2, so [1,0] is correct, but along -z direction, operator is P.n = -P_z, eigenvalue is +ħ/2 → need care here... Maybe I got a phase factor depending on theta. Wait theta=0 and theta=pi parameterizes n in x-z plane. Up to theta=pi.

But when theta is pi, the direction n is along –z. Then P.n = -P_z. Therefore, even if theta is pi, the operator is -P_z. Finding eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2 for -P_z would correspond to eigenvalue of -ħ/2 for P_z, so eigenvector of P_z with -ħ/2 is [0,1], which our formula gives [cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2)] = [0,1], which is correct.

Wait, our normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] which for theta = pi/2 gives [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)] ~ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], which is good for n along x-axis, but our operator n.x in x-z plane when theta = 90 degrees, which would point along x. Then when operator is P_x, eigenstate with +ħ/2 is indeed [1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)]. Similarly.

So the calculation seems to check out.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but originally, we had normalized eigenvector as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], without complex components. But wait, the original matrices for P_x and P_z are real except for P_y, which isn't involved here. Since our problem is in the x-z plane and n lying there, matrix for P is real, so eigenvectors can be chosen real. Hence, the real components as above.

But the question says "elements of the normalized eigenvector"; so presumably [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] as column vector for components in the standard basis.

Therefore, the answer should be in terms of theta. But wait, but do they need theta in terms of direction n coordinates?

Alternatively, perhaps they mean in the general form. Wait no, the problem states "along an arbitrary direction n" in x-z plane. Since the direction is arbitrary, the answer would naturally be expressed in terms of theta (angle in x-z plane). But perhaps t the problem didn't mention a specific parametrization? However, usually, such eigenvectors are written using theta. Wait, let me check the problem again.

"Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +hbar/2... What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"

Hmm, maybe the answer is written as a function of theta, which is the angle in the x-z plane with the z-axis. So yes, perhaps written as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] or expressed in other terms.

Alternatively, sometimes eigenvectors for spin-1/2 in direction n are written as a two-component spinor, here normalized. So consistency checking, yes, the spin-up eigenvector in direction n is [exp(-i phi/2) cos(theta/2), exp(i phi/2) sin(theta/2)], but since in x-z plane, phi=0, phi=0, so it becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Therefore, yes, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] as a column vector. So I think that is the answer. So the elements are first element cos(theta/2), second element sin(theta/2). Therefore, in boxed notation:

**Final Answer**
The normalized eigenvector has elements \boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} and \boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.

But typically, eigenvectors are presented as column vectors. The correct answer in terms of a vector would have two components, so maybe should just write this as a vector. However, since in the original problem, to stick with the guideline:

Wait in the problem statement, they first stated "Calculate the eigenvector...", and the solution requires knowing that for Pauli matrices rotated in n direction (x-z plane), spin-up eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Alternatively, depending on conventions. Let me verify with theta=0. If theta is the angle from the z-axis, then when theta=0, direction is +z, eigenvector is [1,0], which cos(0) gives 1, sin(0) 0. Correct. When theta=pi, [cos(pi/2), sin(pi/2)] = [0,1], which is eigenvector of -z direction with eigenvalue +ħ/2, consistent. When theta=pi/2, direction along x-axis, the eigenvector is [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)] = [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which matches the eigenvector of S_x with eigenvalue +1. Therefore, correct.

So yes, the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which is the standard result. The boxed answer should be presented as a vector:

But since the system expects multiple boxes, perhaps:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}

Alternatively, maybe even factor out exp(i phi/2), but since phi=0 here, it's just [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. However, the problem says "elements of the normalized eigenvector", so written in component form in a column vector. Therefore, I'll present that.

**Final Answer**
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} and \boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} as the first and second components, respectively.

Alternatively, presented as:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}

Since maybe expected as a single vector in a box.

Yes, I think this is acceptable. The standard spin-1/2 eigenvector for spin up in the direction specified by polar angle theta and azimuthal angle phi=0 is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]

Therefore, the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]^T is indeed the solution. And normalized because cos²(theta/2 ) + sin²(theta/2 ) =1. Therefore, this vector is already normalized. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]^T.\n\nBut wait, does that answer match with the matrix we have?

If along x-axis, theta=pi/2, then n=(1,0,0 ), and eigenvector [cos(pi/4 ), sin(pi/4 ) ]= [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]^T which is the eigenvector of sigma_x corresponding to eigenvalue +1. Which is correct because the eigenvalues of sigma_x for the eigenvectors [1,1] and [1,-1], but normalized. Indeed, 1/sqrt(2) [1,1] for eigenvalue +1, which matches when theta=pi/2, then theta/2=pi/4, cox(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, same with sine. So yes, the eigenvalue is correct.\n\nTherefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue +1 when acting on the aforementioned matrix (which is analogous to the Pauli matrices scaled) is [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]. Hence, real coefficients because the direction is along x-z plane (phi=0). So the answer must be [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )] as the elements, normalized.\n\nWait, but how is theta defined? The angle with respect to the z-axis or x-axis? Since n is lying in the x-z plane, theta is the polar angle from the z-axis. So using standard spherical coordinates, theta=0 is along z, theta=pi/2 is along x.\n\nYes, that is consistent with our previous example. Hence, the elements of the eigenvector are [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]. Opit。\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\\\ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThus, this is the normalized eigenvector (since cos² + sin² =1) corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P·n where n is in the x-z plane at polar angle theta. Therefore, the elements are as above.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\\\ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}$.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744976201, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3610, prompt_tokens=1316, total_tokens=4926, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Given the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) lying in the x-z plane, we need to find the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). The components of the operator \(\vec{P}\) are given by the Pauli matrices scaled by \(\hbar/2\):

- \(P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
- \(P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
- \(P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}\)

The direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane can be parameterized by the polar angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis, with the azimuthal angle \(\phi = 0\). The operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right)
\]

Combining these matrices, we get:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. \((\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0\)
2. \(\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0\)

Solving these equations, we find that \(a = \cot(\theta/2) b\). Using trigonometric identities and normalization, we determine the eigenvector. The normalized eigenvector for a spin-1/2 system along direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

= (cosθ + 1) / sinθ

Multiply both sides by sinθ (cosθ -1 ):

- sin^2θ = (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1 )

Note that (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1 ) = cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ

Thus:

- sin²θ = -sin²θ

Which holds true. Therefore, our two equations are consistent, and we can use either expression to relate a and b.

Let's pick the second equation: a = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ b

Alternatively, we can also note that cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2), and cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(θ/2). Let's try substituting some trigonometric identities to simplify.

But maybe easier to express in terms of half-angle identities:

We can write cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2) and cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Let me compute.

Denote φ = θ/2 so that theta = 2φ.

Then, a = (cos2φ + 1)/sin2φ * b. Cos2φ +1 = 2 cos²φ, and sin2φ = 2 sinφ cosφ.

Therefore, (2 cos^2φ)/(2 sinφ cosφ ) = cotφ

Hence, a = cotφ b = cot(θ/2) * b

Alternatively, since a = cot(θ/2) * b, we can write

Normalizing the eigenvector [a, b]^T such that |a|² + |b|² =1.

If a = cot(θ/2) * b, then |cot(theta/2) b|² + |b|² =1 =>
|cot(theta/2)|² |b|² + |b|² = |b|² ( cot²(theta/2) +1 ) = |b|² csc²(theta/2 ) =1 => |b|= sin(theta/2 )

So, let's choose b = sin(theta/2 ). Then, a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

Therefore, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]^T up to a phase factor. But since eigenvectors can have global phase factors, we can set this to simplest real positive components, perhaps?

Wait, but hold on. Let's check this. Alternatively, sometimes depending on the operator's parametrization, the eigenvectors can have different expressions, but perhaps there is an error.

Wait, let's plug back in.

Wait, take an alternative approach. Let me parametrize the eigenvector as [a, b]^T.

From the equation:

If [ [cosθ a + sinθ b ]   [a]
  [ sinθ a - cosθ b ]     [b]

Which equals:

[ cosθ a + sinθ b = a
  sinθ a - cosθ b = b ]

First equation:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a => (cosθ -1 )a + sinθ b =0

Second equation:

sinθ a - (cosθ +1 ) b =0

Now, let's write these equations:

From first equation, (1 - cosθ )a = sinθ b => a = [sinθ / (1 - cosθ ) ] *b

Note that as before. However, sinθ / (1 - cosθ ) equals cot(theta/2 ) because:

sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )

1 - cos theta = 2 sin²(theta/2 )

Therefore,

sin theta / (1 - cos theta ) = (2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )) / (2 sin²(theta/2 )) ) = cot(theta/2 )

Therefore, a = cot(theta/2 ) *b.

Hence, the ratio a/b = cot(theta/2 )

But depending on the component relationships, let's suppose the eigenvector is proportional to [cot(theta/2 ), 1]^T. Hence, normalize this.

Set the eigenvector as N [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ].

Compute the normalization factor:

N² [ cot²(theta/2 ) +1 ] = N² csc²(theta/2 )
So N is sin(theta/2 ), so that N² csc²(theta/2 ) = sin²(theta/2 ) / sin²(theta/2 ) =1. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2 ) * sin(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]^T.

Which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]^T. Alternatively, an eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] normalized.

Alternatively, let's take another approach. Let me parametrize using angles. In spin systems along direction n, the eigenstate of S·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is

|+n> = e^{-iφ/2} cos(theta/2)|+> + e^{iφ/2} sin(theta/2)|->

But wait, here phi is the azimuthal angle. Since in this problem, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi =0. Therefore, phi/2=0, so e^{i0}=1. So:

|+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + sin(theta/2)|−z> 

Wait, here |+z> would correspond to spin up along z, and |−z> spin down. Therefore, written in the standard basis, where |+z> is [1,0] and |−z> is [0,1], but need to verify.

However, in this problem, the eigenvector is expressed as a column vector [a, b]^T, so perhaps if our usual |+z> is [1,0], then |+n> would be:

cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{iϕ} sin(theta/2)|−z>, but when phi=0, then it's [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. So is this the eigenvector?

Wait, but in this particular setup, a and b are coefficients of which basis?

The given components of the operator P are presented as 2x2 matrices. Knowing that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are σ_x=[[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y=[[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z=[[1,0],[0,-1]], and in our problem P_x= (ħ/2)σ_x, P_y=(ħ/2)σ_y, P_z=(ħ/2)σ_z. Therefore, in the standard basis where σ_z is diagonal, the eigenvectors of σ_z are [1,0] for eigenvalue +1 and [0,1] for -1.

Therefore, the operator (P·n) in our problem is (ħ/2)(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z )

Computing that matrix:

$\frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sinθ \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cosθ \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cosθ & \sinθ \\ \sinθ & -\cosθ \end{bmatrix} $

Which is the same as earlier. Therefore, as expected, to find the eigenvalue +ħ/2, we solve:

begin{bmatrix} cosθ & sinθ \\ sinθ & -cosθ end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}

Scaling equation associated with eigenvalue 1 in units of ħ/2.

So,

First equation: cosθ a + sinθ b = a => (cosθ −1) a + sinθ b =0

Second equation: sinθ a − cosθ b = b => sinθ a − (cosθ +1) b =0

Earlier, we determined that writing a in terms of b or vice versa. Let's consider another angle: the eigenvector can be seen as the same as the spin state pointing in direction n. In quantum mechanics, a spin-1/2 state pointing in the direction n=(sinθ, 0, cosθ ) is given by:

|ψ> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |−z>

But phi=0 here, because n is in the x-z plane, so azimuthal angle is 0. Thus,

|ψ> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + sin(θ/2) |−z>

But written as a vector, if |+z> = [1, 0]^T, then |−z> is [0,1]^T, hence:

|ψ> = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

This seems to be the standard result. Let's verify this against our previous equation. Let a = cos(θ/2 ), b = sin(θ/2 )

Check if they satisfy the two equations.

First equation:

(cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = (cosθ -1 ) cos(θ/2 ) + sinθ sin(θ/2 )

Using double-angle identities:

cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2 ) -1, so cosθ-1 = 2cos²(θ/2 ) -2 = -2sin²(θ/2 )

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2 ) cos(θ/2 )

Plug those into equation:

Left-hand side:

[ -2 sin²(θ/2 ) ] * cos(θ/2 ) + 2 sin(θ/2 ) cos(θ/2 ) * sin(θ/2 )

= -2 sin²(θ/2 ) cos(θ/2 ) + 2 sin²(θ/2 ) cos(θ/2 )

=0. Therefore, verified.

Second equation: sin(theta ) a - ( cos theta +1 ) b = ? Let's compute:

sin(theta ) cos(theta/2 ) - (cos theta +1 ) sin(theta/2 )

sin(theta ) cos(theta/2 ) = 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 ) * cos(theta/2 ) = 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos²(theta/2 )

(cos theta +1 ) sin(theta/2 ) = (2 cos²(theta/2 ) -1 +1 ) sin(theta/2 ) = 2 cos²(theta/2 ) sin(theta/2 )

Now:

2 sin(theta/2 ) cos²(theta/2 ) - 2 cos²(theta/2 ) sin(theta/2 )=0

Therefore, the second equation is also satisfied. Therefore, the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]^T is indeed the solution. And normalized because cos²(theta/2 ) + sin²(theta/2 ) =1. Therefore, this vector is already normalized. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]^T.

But wait, does that answer match with the matrix we have? Let me just confirm.

Yes, because when the direction lies along the x-z plane (phi=0), the standard eigenvector for spin in that direction is as above.

Alternatively, when the direction is along z (theta=0), n=(0, 0,1 ), so theta=0 => eigenvector [1,0]^T which is correct. If along x-axis, theta=pi/2, then n=(1,0,0 ), and eigenvector [cos(pi/4 ), sin(pi/4 ) ]= [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]^T which is the eigenvector of sigma_x corresponding to eigenvalue +1. Which is correct because the eigenvalues of sigma_x for the eigenvectors [1,1] and [1,-1], but normalized. Indeed, 1/sqrt(2) [1,1] for eigenvalue +1, which matches when theta=pi/2, then theta/2=pi/4, cox(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, same with sine. So yes, the eigenvalue is correct.

Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue +1 when acting on the aforementioned matrix (which is analogous to the Pauli matrices scaled) is [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]. Hence, real coefficients because the direction is along x-z plane (phi=0). So the answer must be [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )] as the elements, normalized.

Wait, but how is theta defined? The angle with respect to the z-axis or x-axis? Since n is lying in the x-z plane, theta is the polar angle from the z-axis. So using standard spherical coordinates, theta=0 is along z, theta=pi/2 is along x.

Yes, that is consistent with our previous example. Hence, the elements of the eigenvector are [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]. Opit。

Therefore, the answer is:

$\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}$

Thus, this is the normalized eigenvector (since cos² + sin² =1) corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P·n where n is in the x-z plane at polar angle theta. Therefore, the elements are as above.

**Final Answer**
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are $\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}$.
