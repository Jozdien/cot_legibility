To produce and purify Human P53 in *E. coli* BL21 efficiently, the optimal plasmid should include the following features:

1. **T7 Promoter**: This ensures high-level expression when induced with IPTG. Since BL21 is commonly used as a DE3 lysogen (BL21(DE3)) that provides T7 RNA polymerase, this promoter is ideal for robust protein production.  
2. **His-Tag**: A 6xHis tag (N- or C-terminal) allows rapid purification via immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), aligning with the goal of quick purification.  
3. **Ampicillin Resistance**: A standard selection marker for plasmid maintenance in *E. coli*.  
4. **Ribosome Binding Site (RBS)**: Ensures efficient translation initiation in the bacterial system.  
5. **Codon Optimization**: While not explicitly stated, the plasmid should encode the P53 sequence codon-optimized for *E. coli* to enhance expression.  

**Answer**: The correct plasmid is the one containing a **T7 promoter, His-tag, ampicillin resistance, and a strong RBS**, typically found in vectors like the pET series (e.g., pET-28a). This setup enables high-yield expression in BL21(DE3) and straightforward purification for structural studies.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I just started this job at Stanford's structural biology lab and need to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence and asked me to pick the right plasmid from four options. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that E. coli is a prokaryotic system, so the plasmid needs to have elements compatible with bacterial expression. The main things I should look for in a plasmid for protein expression are: a strong promoter (like T7, lac, or ara), a multiple cloning site (MCS) for inserting the gene, a selectable marker (usually antibiotic resistance like ampicillin or kanamycin), and possibly a fusion tag for purification, like a His-tag. Also, since BL21 is a common strain for protein expression, sometimes they have the T7 RNA polymerase under inducible control (like with IPTG), so the plasmid might use a T7 promoter which is induced by IPTG.

Looking at the amino acid sequence of P53: It's human, which is eukaryotic, so E. coli might have trouble with post-translational modifications, but maybe P53 doesn't require them for structural studies. Also, I need to check if the gene is codon-optimized for E. coli to improve expression. Wait, but the plasmids provided probably already contain the coding sequence. Wait, but the question gives us four plasmids with different sequences. The options must relate to elements like promoters, origin of replication, tags, or selection markers. Since the question says "4 different sequences," maybe each plasmid has different components.

Wait, let me organize the factors:

1. **Promoter**: For high-level protein expression in E. coli BL21, a T7 promoter is often used. Since BL21 strains typically carry the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the lacUV5 promoter (like in DE3 strains), so using a T7 promoter in the plasmid would allow induction with IPTG. If the plasmid uses a T7 promoter, that would be compatible.

2. **Origin of replication**: Should be compatible with E. coli. Common ones are pUC ori for high copy number. But probably all four plasmids have compatible origins.

3. **Selection marker**: Ampicillin (amp), kanamycin (kan), etc. Again, it's probably present, but maybe the resistance gene varies between the plasmids, but the strain's compatibility (like if the strain has a plasmid with a different marker already) – but perhaps the question assumes that whichever plasmid with a standard marker (like amp resistance) would work.

4. **Fusion tags**: If the plasmid includes a His-tag (6xHis), then purification via nickel or cobalt affinity chromatography would be easier. The question mentions purifying quickly, so having a His-tag would help. Also, maybe other tags like GST or MBP, but His-tag is simplest. So the correct plasmid should have a His-tag sequence.

5. **Presence of a ribosome binding site (RBS)**: The plasmid should have a Shine-Dalgarno sequence upstream of the start codon for proper translation in E. coli.

6. **Cloning site**: The gene should be inserted in frame with any tags. If the plasmid has a His-tag at the N- or C-terminus, the P53 gene should be cloned accordingly.

Also, perhaps the presence of a protease cleavage site (like TEV) to remove the tag if needed, but the question says "as quickly as possible," so maybe that's not necessary. Just needing to express and purify.

Since the amino acid sequence starts with M (methionine, the start codon), but in the plasmid, maybe the cloning is done with the ATG followed by the His-tag. Wait, no, the gene's own start codon is included, unless the plasmid appends a tag.

Wait, the problem states that the amino acid sequence of the protein is given. So if the plasmid adds a His-tag, the recombinant protein would have additional amino acids. The given sequence starts with MEEPQ..., so if the plasmid adds a tag, like at the N-terminus, then the protein would be His-tag followed by the MEEPQ... If that's acceptable, then plasmid with a His-tag is better. However, in some cases, the tag might interfere with the protein function or structure, but the question just wants production and purification. Purification would be quicker with a His-tag.

Alternatively, maybe the plasmids vary in things like presence of a T7 promoter, efficiency of replication, etc.

Wait, but the key is that E. coli BL21 (which is a common strain for protein expression) – specifically, BL21(DE3) has the T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the lacUV5 promoter, so IPTG inducible. If the plasmid has a T7 promoter, then induction with IPTG will initiate transcription. If the plasmid doesn't use a T7 promoter, like maybe using a different promoter (like the lac promoter), then BL21 might not have the right RNA polymerase. Wait, but BL21 doesn't have the T7 polymerase unless it's a DE3 lysogen. So maybe the four plasmids differ in promoters. Suppose some plasmids use T7 promoters (which would require the strain to have T7 RNA polymerase, which is present in BL21(DE3)). Wait, but the question says E. coli BL21, not BL21(DE3). Hmm, this could be crucial. If the strain is BL21 without DE3, then T7 promoter won't work because they lack the T7 RNA polymerase. Therefore, in that case, a plasmid with a T7 promoter would not be functional unless the strain has DE3. But the problem just says BL21. Oh, but maybe those four plasmids include the ones that contain the DE3 lytic elements? Wait, no. DE3 is a lambda-derived element that is integrated into the E. coli genome. The plasmid wouldn't include that. So if the strain is BL21 (non DE3), then using a T7 promoter is useless. Hmmm, this raises a problem.

But it's possible that the plasmid uses a promoter that doesn't require T7. For example, the lac promoter, which is induced by IPTG, but BL21 has the lacUV5 promoter for the lac operon. Wait, usual BL21 strains might have the T7 RNA polymerase if they're DE3, but otherwise, if the plasmid uses a different promoter, like the pLac or pTac promoter, which is inducible by IPTG and uses the host's RNA polymerase. However, BL21 is a lon protease-deficient and ompT protease-deficient strain, but that mainly affects protein stability.

Wait, perhaps the critical thing here is the promoter in the plasmid. So if the plasmid has T7 promoter, then the strain must carry DE3 (T7 RNA polymerase under IPTG control). If the strain is plain BL21 (without DE3), then T7 promoter is not useful. However, if the PI mentioned BL21, it's common in expression systems to use BL21(DE3). But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we are to assume that the plasmid must have a promoter that works in BL21.

Alternatively, if they have four plasmids with various promoters, the correct one might be T7, assuming the strain is DE3 competent. Alternatively, maybe the plasmid uses an arabinose-inducible promoter (araBAD) which can be induced by L-arabinose. But without knowing the strain's genotype on that, maybe it's safer to assume that they have T7. But perhaps the question is assuming that T7 is the way to go, being the most common for high-level expression in BL21(DE3).

Alternatively, the answer is the plasmid that has the T7 promoter, a ribosome binding site, a His-tag (for purification), and amp resistance (depending on the plasmid's markers). So the correct plasmid would have these elements.

Given that the protein is Human P53, which is a relatively large protein (393 amino acids), expression in E. coli might form inclusion bodies. However, the question is about producing and purifying quickly, so maybe with a His-tag for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification. Even if it's in inclusion bodies, you can still denature and purify, but maybe the plasmid includes a solubility enhancer tag like GST or MBP. Wait, but the question says "as quickly as possible," so maybe His-tag is faster.

Looking for plasmids that have a T7 promoter, His-tag, and antibiotic resistance compatible.

In many expression vectors like pET vectors (from Novagen, now MilliporeSigma), which are commonly used for T7 promoter-driven expression. pET vectors typically have a T7 promoter, RBS, multiple cloning site, optional tags (like His-tag), and ampicillin resistance. For example, pET-28a has an N-terminal His-tag and a T7 promoter, requiring BL21(DE3) strains. If the given plasmids include a pET-based vector, that'd be the right choice.

Assuming that the correct answer is the plasmid that has a T7 promoter, a His-tag, and amp resistance. Therefore, the plasmid numbers (if provided) might include such elements.

But as the user hasn't listed the four plasmids, maybe they expect knowledge of standard expression vectors. However, the options must distinguish based on the sequence elements. If Human P53's sequence is provided, perhaps the DNA sequence in the plasmid would need to have compatible restriction sites for cloning. But given that the answer is one of four plasmids with "different sequences," maybe the correct plasmid includes an ATG start codon, the correct coding sequence (without mutations), a His-tag in frame, a T7 promoter, and so on.

Alternatively, because P53 is a nuclear protein that may require eukaryotic chaperones, expression in E. coli might be challenging. However, if the plasmid uses a strong promoter and the gene is codon-optimized for E. coli, that can help.

But all of this is based on plasmid elements. If the four plasmids differ in promoter presence, presence of tags, origin of replication, and selection markers, the correct plasmid would be the one with:

- T7 promoter (for inducible expression with IPTG in BL21(DE3))

- His-tag (for efficient affinity purification)

- Ampicillin resistance (common in pET vectors)

Therefore, the correct choice is the plasmid with those features.

I recently began working at Stanford's structural biology laboratory and have been assigned to produce and purify Human P53 protein using E. coli BL21. The principal investigator provided me with the amino acid sequence and asked me to select the appropriate plasmid from four available options. I should analyze this methodically.

I need to remember that E. coli is prokaryotic, so the plasmid must contain elements suitable for bacterial expression systems. When choosing a protein expression plasmid, I should consider: a robust promoter (such as T7, lac, or ara), a multiple cloning site (MCS) for gene insertion, an antibiotic resistance marker (typically ampicillin or kanamycin), and potentially a purification tag like His-tag. Since BL21 is frequently used for protein expression, it may contain T7 RNA polymerase under inducible control (via IPTG), meaning the plasmid might utilize a T7 promoter inducible by IPTG.

Regarding P53's amino acid sequence: Being human-derived (eukaryotic), E. coli might struggle with post-translational modifications, though perhaps P53 doesn't require these for structural studies. I should verify if the gene is codon-optimized for E. coli to enhance expression. However, the provided plasmids likely already contain the coding sequence. Since the question mentions "4 different sequences," the plasmids probably differ in elements such as promoters, replication origins, tags, or selection markers.

Let me consider key factors:

1. **Promoter**: Efficient protein expression in E. coli BL21 often uses a T7 promoter. BL21 strains typically contain the T7 RNA polymerase gene controlled by the lacUV5 promoter (as in DE3 strains), so a plasmid with a T7 promoter would work well with IPTG induction.

2. **Origin of replication**: Must be E. coli compatible. High copy number plasmids often use pUC ori, though all four plasmids likely have compatible origins.

3. **Selection marker**: Options include ampicillin, kanamycin, etc. While all plasmids probably contain resistance genes, they might differ between plasmids, though strain compatibility may be assumed in the question.

# OpenAI completion

I recently started working at Stanford's structural biology lab, and my current task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein using E. coli BL21. My principal investigator (PI) provided the amino acid sequence and asked me to choose the most suitable plasmid from four available options. I'll go through the decision process step by step.

First, I recall that since E. coli is a prokaryotic system, the plasmid must contain elements compatible with bacterial expression. The key components to consider for a plasmid intended for protein expression include: a strong promoter (such as T7, lac, or ara), a multiple cloning site (MCS) for gene insertion, a selectable marker (typically antibiotic resistance like ampicillin or kanamycin), and potentially a fusion tag for purification, such as a His-tag. Additionally, given that BL21 is a popular strain for protein expression, it often possesses the T7 RNA polymerase under an inducible system (for instance, with IPTG), meaning the plasmid may employ a T7 promoter activated by IPTG.

The amino acid sequence of P53 is human and hence eukaryotic, which may pose challenges for E. coli with post-translational modifications, although P53 might not need these modifications for structural research. It's also important to verify if the gene is codon-optimized for E. coli to boost expression. However, the plasmids likely already include the coding sequence. The question provides four plasmids with unique sequences, indicating variations in elements like promoters, origin of replication, tags, or selection markers. Given "4 different sequences," each plasmid must have distinct components.

Let's organize these factors:

1. **Promoter**: For optimal protein expression in E. coli BL21, a T7 promoter is frequently used. BL21 strains usually contain the T7 RNA polymerase gene controlled by the lacUV5 promoter (as in DE3 strains), so utilizing a T7 promoter in the plasmid would permit IPTG induction. A T7 promoter in the plasmid would thus be appropriate.

2. **Origin of replication**: It should be suitable for E. coli. Common origins include pUC ori for high copy numbers. Likely, all four plasmids possess compatible origins.

3. **Selection marker**: Could be ampicillin (amp), kanamycin (kan), etc. Such markers are probably included, although the resistance genes might differ between plasmids. The strain's compatibility, such as if there is an existing plasmid with a different marker, might be relevant—but perhaps the question assumes compatibility for any plasmid selected.

utable marker is okay.

4. **Fusion tags**: If the plasmid includes sequences for a His-tag (e.g., 6xHis), GST, or MBP, that would help in purification via affinity chromatography. Since the question mentions purifying quickly, they probably want a His-tag for IMAC (immobilized metal affinity chromatography). The plasmid should have the P53 coding sequence fused to a His-tag, either N-terminal or C-terminal.

5. **Cloning site/position of the gene**: The gene should be cloned in frame with the tag. For example, if the plasmid has a His-tag followed by a multiple cloning site, then the P53 should be cloned in frame so the His-tag is attached.

Given the amino acid sequence provided starts with MEEPQ... So the initial methionine is present. But in plasmids, sometimes they add a start codon. Wait, the plasmid would include the gene, so that sequence is the coding sequence. But wait, in E. coli expression plasmids, the gene is usually under the control of the promoter, so the plasmid would have a promoter, a ribosome binding site, then the coding sequence.

Wait, the question states that the four plasmids contain 4 different sequences. Maybe each plasmid has a different combination of promoter, RBS, tags, etc. Since we need to pick the best one for high-level expression and easy purification.

Potential plasmid elements to look for:

- T7 promoter (since BL21 DE3 has T7 polymerase)
- Presence of a His-tag (like 6xHis) to enable nickel column purification
- Proper antibiotic resistance (like amp resistance which is common)
- Possibly a fusion partner to enhance solubility, but P53 might be a problem for solubility; maybe the plasmid includes a solubility tag like SUMO or GST? But the question says "as quickly as possible", so maybe a simple His-tag is better without a larger tag if possible.
- Presence of a lac operator for inducible expression (like under T7/lac promoter which can be induced with IPTG)

So, putting this together, the correct plasmid should have:

- T7 promoter for high-level expression in BL21 (if BL21 is DE3, which has T7 RNA polymerase)
- A His-tag sequence (probably 6xHis) either at the N or C terminus of the cloned gene
- An antibiotic resistance gene (like ampicillin)
- Possibly a ribosome binding site (RBS) optimized for E. coli.

Assuming that the PI is using BL21(DE3) which is common for T7-based expression, then the plasmid should have a T7 promoter, followed by the His-tag sequence, then the P53 gene in frame. The plasmid would also have an origin of replication, and amp resistance.

Looking for which plasmid has these features. Since the answer options are not listed here, I need to infer based on standard plasmids used for this purpose. Common expression vectors are pET vectors (from Novagen), which are T7 promoter-based, with His-tags. For example, pET-28a has a T7 promoter, kanamycin resistance, and an N-terminal His-tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. But the resistance would be kanamycin. Alternatively, pET-21 has ampicillin resistance and a C-terminal His-tag. Wait, BL21 cells are compatible with various plasmids. 

However, since the user hasn't provided the four plasmid options, I must imagine that the answer relies on standard knowledge. The key points are T7 promoter and His-tag for purification.

Assuming that among the four, the correct plasmid has the T7 promoter, a His-tag (perhaps a 6xHis tag) fused to the P53 gene, and the appropriate selection marker. Since BL21(DE3) is typically used with pET vectors which use T7, so the plasmid is likely a pET plasmid. If ampicillin is the resistance, maybe pET-21 family, but often pET vectors use kanamycin. However, the resistance may vary. If one of the plasmids has a T7 promoter, His-tag, and compatible resistance, then that's the one.

Alternatively, maybe there's a lac promoter if they're not using a DE3 strain, but BL21 without DE3 would lack T7 polymerase. Since the PI mentioned producing in BL21, the user probably is using BL21(DE3), hence T7 promoter is needed. Therefore, the plasmid must contain the T7 promoter, and in that case, inducible with IPTG.

Another aspect is whether the plasmid requires a compatible origin. High-copy origins like pUC are common. So putting all these together, the correct plasmid is the one with the T7 promoter, a His-tag, and appropriate resistance.

So the answer should be the plasmid that includes T7 promoter and a His-tag, and perhaps amp or kanamycin resistance, but the key features are promoter and tag. The plasmid sequence would have those elements.

To produce and purify Human P53 in *E. coli* BL21 efficiently, the ideal plasmid should include the following features:

1. **T7 Promoter**: The BL21 strain, especially DE3 variants, contains the T7 RNA polymerase under IPTG-inducible control. A plasmid with a T7 promoter (e.g., pET vectors) ensures high-level expression when induced.

2. **Affinity Tag (His-Tag)**: A hexahistidine (His6) tag, typically N-terminal or C-terminal, allows rapid purification via immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). This is critical for quick purification.

3. **Codon Optimization**: The P53 gene should be codon-optimized for *E. coli* to maximize expression efficiency, given the differences in codon usage between humans and bacteria.

4. **Selection Marker**: Antibiotic resistance (e.g., ampicillin or kanamycin) for plasmid maintenance. Compatibility with BL21 is assumed.

5. **Ribosome Binding Site (RBS)**: Optimized for translation initiation in *E. coli*.

### Which Plasmid to Choose?
Assuming the four plasmids vary in promoters, tags, and optimization:
- **Optimal Plasmid**: The one with a **T7 promoter, His-tag, and codon-optimized P53 gene** (e.g., a pET-series vector like pET-28a). This combination ensures high-yield expression in BL21(DE3) and straightforward purification.

**Why?**
- *T7 Promoter*: Maximizes expression in BL21(DE3) upon IPTG induction.
- *His-Tag*: Simplifies purification using nickel affinity columns.
- *Codon Optimization*: Avoids translational stalling in *E. coli*, ensuring sufficient protein yield.

Avoid plasmids with alternative promoters (e.g., CMV for mammalian cells), absence of affinity tags, or lack of codon optimization.

4. **Tags**: For purification purposes, affinity tags like a His6-tag (hexahistidine) are common. The PI emphasizes quick purification, so a plasmid with an N-terminal or C-terminal His-tag would streamline purification via nickel-affinity chromatography. Tags such as GST, MBP, or others are alternatives but could add unnecessary size if not needed. The presence of a protease cleavage site (e.g., TEV or thrombin) would also be beneficial if tags need removal—though if time is critical, maybe the His-tag is sufficient, and the protein can be used without cleavage.

5. **Multiple Cloning Site**: The sequence must be correctly inserted in frame. Otherwise, reading frame shifts would corrupt the gene product. This suggests that the correct plasmid would have the P53 gene cloned in frame with any tags and under the promoter. But since the plasmids are given, the user probably chose the appropriate vector with correct insertion.

6. **Inducible system**: The T7 promoter is inducible by IPTG in BL21(DE3) strains. If the plasmids use an arabinose-inducible promoter (araBAD) or other, then the strain must be compatible. However, BL21 is commonly used with T7.

Assuming the four plasmids have variations in promoters, presence/absence of tags, origin of replication, and selection markers. Based on the need for efficient expression and quick purification:

- Best candidate plasmid would have T7 promoter, His-tag (likely at N-terminus for efficient translation), ampicillin resistance (common), and perhaps a ribosome binding site optimized for E. coli.

Since the user is to choose between four plasmids, if someone else provided these options, the correct one would be the plasmid containing: T7 promoter, His-tag, and compatible with BL21. Possible additional elements could be a terminator sequence, but less likely a key factor here.

But perhaps other elements: vectors without a T7 promoter would not be induced in BL21(DE3). If one plasmid features a constitutive promoter or requires a different inducer, but given that BL21 is typically used with inducible T7, probably the correct plasmid is the one with T7.

Another angle: cloning compatibility. Actually, with the given P53 amino acid sequence, the coding DNA sequence (CDS) corresponding to this protein should be correctly inserted into the plasmid's MCS. The plasmid must include the coding sequence for P53 (assuming that's the case). Alternatively, perhaps the user is choosing between plasmid backbones where one is compatible with inserting the gene. However, the question states the plasmids already contain different sequences, so perhaps each plasmid has one of the sequences provided. Wait, the amino acid sequence given is the target protein. Then, the four plasmids must contain DNA sequences encoding P53 but with different features.

Wait, the question says: "You are given 4 plasmids containing 4 different sequences, which one are you going to use?" Given that they mention producing P53 in E. coli, maybe the "different sequences" are the structural gene for P53 but variant sequences: GenBank has G blocks ordered, perhaps with codon optimization, presence of tags, etc.

In that case, the correct plasmid would need to have:

- Codon-optimized gene for E. coli to enhance expression (since human genes often have different codon usage, which can reduce expression in E. coli). Thus, plasmid with codon-optimized sequence likely improves expression.

- The gene must be flanked by appropriate promoter and terminator. So plasmid should have T7 promoter if using BL21(DE3). If BL21 is a DE3 strain, which provides T7 polymerase induced by IPTG, then a plasmid with T7 promoter is essential. The other plasmids might have constitutive promoters that are less controllable.

- Possible presence of purification tags (His-tag, GST, etc.). Since the user needs to purify quickly, a His-tag would allow for IMAC (e.g., nickel column), straightforward purification. If one plasmid has a His-tag, that's preferable. If others have tags that require more steps (e.g., GST requires glutathione columns, or FLAG tags need specific antibodies), His-Tag is simpler.

- Selection marker, perhaps, but less critical for functionality; assuming all plasmas have a compatible selection (e.g., amp resistance), amp plates are straightforward.

So criteria: T7 promoter, codon-optimized P53 gene, presence of His-tag (probably N-terminal), and maybe a protease cleavage site (optional if tag doesn't interfere with structure; but for speed, maybe cleavage isn't done). Alternatively, if using a vector with a cleavable His-tag, maybe adds a step; but if P53 structure tolerates His-tag, perhaps leave it on.

In that case, which factors are most critical?

T7 promoter, RBS (ribosome binding site), correct cloning of P53 gene (inserted in frame), selectable marker, and His-tag for easy purification.

Of the four plasmids, the best one would combine all those features. So between the four, the one that has T7 promoter, His-tag, correct antibiotic resistance, and codon-optimized gene.

Alternatively, some of the plasmids may have the P53 gene, but without a promoter, the wrong promoter (like araBAD), without tags (which would make purification harder), or use a different selection antibiotic that isn't compatible.

Given BL21 (often uses T7, DE3 strain), the plasmid must have a T7 promoter. Otherwise, no transcription.

So, if one plasmid has T7 promoter, then that's key. Then, the His-tag. Others may have, for example, a CMV promoter (which would work in mammalian cells, useless in E. coli), lac promoter (without the T7 polymerase, lac operon might require lacI, but BL21 can have IPTG inducible systems... Wait, the normal lac promoter requires the lacZ for regulation, but if the plasmid uses a T7 promoter, then having the DE3 strain (with T7 RNA polymerase under lacUV5 control) is necessary. If the plasmid uses the regular lac promoter, maybe works with IPTG but has lower expression compared to T7.

So in BL21(DE3) cells that contain the T7 RNA polymerase gene under lacUV5 control, so when you add IPTG, T7 RNA pol is expressed, which in turn drives expression from T7 promoter. Therefore, having T7 promoter on the plasmid is crucial. If the plasmid uses a different promoter, like pTrc (which is a hybrid trp-lac promoter), which is regulated by lac operon and induced by IPTG, then in BL21 (non-DE3), or BL21(DE3) strains, maybe there's leakage. But for high-level expression, T7-driven is better. Therefore, plasmid must have a T7 promoter if BL21(DE3) is the host strain. Since build details from the user probably assume which strain, but in many cases, BL21(DE3) is common for T7-based expression. If the plasmid lacks T7 promoter but uses something else like pBAD (arabinose inducible), then even in DE3 strains, the T7 RNA polymerase isn't utilized for that plasmid. If you use a pET vector (which relies on T7 promoter), then you need DE3.

Therefore, the answer would be to use a plasmid that has the T7 promoter and a His-tag for quick purification, so, among the four options, the plasmid with T7 promoter, His-tag (e.g., pET-28a might be a common vector).

However, the exact answer depends on the options, which we don't have, but based on standard vectors for E. coli expression, the ideal one is pET series (T7 promoter, His-tag). So the plasmid with these elements would be the one to choose.
