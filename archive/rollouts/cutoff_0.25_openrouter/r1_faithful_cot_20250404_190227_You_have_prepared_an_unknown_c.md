The unknown compound can be identified as **C₆H₁₀O₂** based on the following analysis:

1. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**  
   - Formula C₆H₁₀O₂ has **2 DoU** (calculated as \(\frac{2(6) + 2 - 10}{2} = 2\)). This aligns with the presence of **both a carbonyl group (C=O)** and a **double bond (C=C)** observed in the spectral data.

2. **FTIR Data:**  
   - **Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹:** Strongly suggests an **O-H stretch** from a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This functional group also explains the **1700 cm⁻¹ peak** (C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid).  
   - **1650 cm⁻¹ peak:** Matches a **C=C stretch**, confirming the presence of a double bond.

3. **¹H NMR Data:**  
   - **Vinyl hydrogens** indicate the presence of protons adjacent to a **double bond**, consistent with the FTIR data.

4. **Mass Spectrometry:**  
   - **Fragment at m/z = 45** corresponds to the **COOH⁺** group (mass: 12 + 16×2 + 1 = 45), characteristic of a carboxylic acid. This fragment supports the presence of a -COOH group in the structure.

**Conclusion:** The compound is a **carboxylic acid with a double bond**, satisfying the spectral data and matching the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula accounts for the carboxylic acid group (C=O and O-H), the double bond (C=C), and the observed fragments in the mass spectrum. 

**Answer:** C₆H₁₀O₂.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Alright, so I need to figure out which chemical formula corresponds to this unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Let's start by listing the given information and then analyze each piece step by step.

First, the possible formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let's note the degrees of unsaturation for each because that might help in combination with the spectral data.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as: DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogens here, so DoU = (2*C + 2 - H)/2.

Calculating for each formula:

1. C6H12O: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. This could be a ring or a double bond.

2. C6H10O: (12 +2 -10)/2 =4/2 =2. So 2 DoU. Could be two double bonds, one double bond and a ring, two rings, or a triple bond.

3. C6H10O2: Same as above, since O doesn't affect DoU. DoU= (12+2-10)/2=2. So same as the previous.

4. C6H12O2: DoU=(12 +2 -12)/2=2/2=1. So one DoU.

Now, looking at the spectral data:

**FTIR:**
- Very broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹: Broad peaks around 3000 often indicate O-H stretching, especially from carboxylic acids, alcohols, or maybe N-H. But since there's no mention of N, probably an O-H. The fact that it's very broad suggests strong hydrogen bonding, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) because they have strong, broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. However, the peak here is at 3000, which is also in the range for alcohols, but the breadth leans more towards carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, the very broad peak might be a carboxylic acid's O-H. Then the other peaks are important.

- Strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹: 1700 is typical for carbonyl (C=O) stretching. Depending on the exact position, it can be a ketone (~1715), aldehyde (~1725), ester (~1740-1760?), or carboxylic acid (~1700-1720). The 1700 could be a carboxylic acid's carbonyl. The 1650 cm⁻¹ is likely a C=C double bond stretch. So we might have both a carbonyl group (possibly from carboxylic acid) and a double bond.

**1H NMR:**
- Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (i.e., hydrogens on a C=C double bond). So there are protons adjacent to a double bond, which would split into specific coupling patterns, like a doublet of doublets, etc. But the exact splitting isn't given, just the presence.

**Mass Spec:**
- Fragment at m/z=45. Common fragments at 45 could be:
  - COOH+ (but the carboxylic acid group would lose OH to give COOH+? Not sure. Let me think: The molecular weight of COOH is 45 (12+16*2 +1 = 45). But maybe the fragment is CH2CH2O+ (but that's 44?), or perhaps the fragment is HCOO- (formate ion is 45: HCOO- has a mass of 1+12+16*2=45). Wait, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the molecular ion might lose the -COOH group? Or, maybe another fragment. Alternatively, the base peak at m/z=45—could be due to the (CH3)2CH+ fragment is 43, so not that. The fragment at 45 is important here. Let's tabulate common m/z values:

- 45 could be a fragment like C2H5O+ (maybe CH2=CH-O- ... but perhaps a carboxylic acid. Wait, the molecular ion for a carboxylic acid would likely lose a COOH group? Alternatively, it's another structure. Alternatively, an ethoxy group? Hmm.

Wait, wait: Common fragment at 45 could be the tropylium ion—unlikely, that's higher. Another possibility: If there is a CH2CH2OH group, but that would potentially give a fragment of 45 (C2H5OH is 46, so minus a H would be 45? Not sure).

Alternatively, let's compute:

For a fragment of m/z=45, possible formulae:

The exact mass would help, but assuming unit mass, possible candidates:

45 = 45 g/mol.

So:

- COOH+ would be 45 (12 + 16*2 +1 = 45), as in the carboxylic acid group. But, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then in the mass spec, often the molecular ion (M+) would undergo fragmentation. For example, a carboxylic acid might lose the -COOH group as COOH (45), but then the remaining part would be M-45. So, for example, if the compound is pentanoic acid (C5H10O2), the molecular ion would be 102, and losing COOH (45) would leave 57 (C4H9+). But the molecular formula in the options are C6H...O, O2 etc. Wait, our possible formulas are:

- C6H12O: molecular weight 6*12 +12 +16= 72 +12 +16=100

- C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98

- C6H10O2:72 +10 +32=114

- C6H12O2:72 +12 +32=116

But the mass of the parent ion isn't given. Sometimes, the molecular ion peak is missing, but in the case of a carboxylic acid, it might show up. The fragment at 45 might be a key piece.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the molecular formula would need to be C5H10O2 (but that isn't an option here). Wait, but in the options given, the possible ones with two oxygen atoms are C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. If the formula were C6H12O2, which has a DoU of 1 (so one ring or one double bond). But wait, according to our previous calculation, C6H12O2 has DoU=1. But according to the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens, indicating a double bond, which would account for the DoU=1 (so no rings). So that would fit.

Alternatively, C6H10O or C6H10O2 have DoU=2. If there's a double bond (taking 1 DoU), perhaps a ring (another DoU). But the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond, not a ring. So that would use up one of the DoU, leaving another. For C6H10O: if the formula has a ketone (C=O, using 1 DoU) plus a double bond (another DoU), that would make sense.

But let's connect this with the IR data. If the FTIR shows a peak at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (C=C). Then that would need both functional groups. So the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Looking at possible structures, this could be something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. For example, a cyclohexenone (but that would be cyclic, so a ring plus ketone). Or maybe an enone (conjugated double bond and ketone). Alternatively, an ester with a double bond, or a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

But considering the very broad absorption at ~3000 cm⁻¹ again. If this is a carboxylic acid O-H stretch, then the compound must have a -COOH group. That would account for the 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O of COOH) and the O-H stretch. So if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the formula would need two oxygen atoms (since COOH is -O2H). So from the options, that would be C6H10O2 or C6H12O2.

Wait, a carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH, so general formula is CnH2nO2. For n=5, that's C5H10O2. But our options start at C6. So the options with O2 are C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.

C6H10O2: Degrees of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. Which would need two DoU. So maybe a double bond (C=C) plus the carboxylic acid (which has a carbonyl, but that is already considered in the DoU calculation. Wait, DoU counts each double bond or ring. A carboxylic acid has a carbonyl (double bond), so that's 1 DoU, plus if there's a C=C double bond, total 2 DoU. That matches.

Alternatively, a ring plus a carbonyl would get two DoU, but the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, which are from double bonds, not rings. Therefore, probably a carboxylic acid with an additional double bond, hence formula C6H10O2.

Similarly, for C6H12O2: DoU=1. That could be a carboxylic acid (1 DoU for C=O) with no double bond, but then we wouldn't have vinyl hydrogens. But the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, which require a double bond (another DoU), necessitating DoU=2. So C6H12O2, with DoU=1, cannot have both a carboxylic acid and a double bond.

Therefore, the formula must be C6H10O2.

Now, consider the mass spec fragment at m/z=45. If this is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the fragment is the -COOH group (mass 45)? Because COOH is 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) + 1 (H) = 45. That makes sense. So when the molecular ion fragments, the -COOH group breaks off as a neutral (COOH loss would be 45, but if the fragment is the COOH+ ion, then it would appear at 45. However, typically in mass spectrometry, when a carboxylic acid loses the -COOH group, the other part would be the remaining R group.

But perhaps another common fragment. For example, for cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, the molecular ion would lose COOH, leaving a cyclopentyl fragment, but that might not give a fragment at 45. But if there's a CH2CH2 group adjacent to the COOH, maybe.

Alternatively, the 45 might be from a different part. If the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 (an ester with a double bond), which is C5H8O2 but our formula is C6H10O2...

Wait, let's think of possible structures. Suppose the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond. So maybe pentenoic acid, but C5H8O2. However, our formula is C6H10O2. Let's count: If R is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-COOH, but that's hexanoic acid (C6H12O2), which is saturated. But that's C6H12O2. However, if there's a double bond in the chain, then it's hexenoic acid, which would be C6H10O2. For example, 4-hexenoic acid: CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCOOH (but wait, need to count the carbons).

Wait, pentenoic acid is C5H8O2. Hexenoic acid would be C6H10O2. So molecular formula C6H10O2. That fits. So in this case, the molecular ion would be 114 (6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114). The fragment at m/z=45 could be COOH+. If the molecular ion loses the rest of the molecule, leaving COOH+ (45). So the remaining part would be 114 -45=69, which might not be as significant. Alternatively, maybe a different cleavage. If the double bond is in a position that allows for cleavage next to it. For example, in a gamma,delta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, cleavage might occur between the alpha and beta carbons, producing a fragment with the COOH group and the double bond.

Alternatively, the presence of a fragment at 45 could also indicate the loss of a smaller fragment. Another possibility: propanoic acid (C3H6O2) has a molecular weight of 74, but maybe that's not relevant here. Alternatively, the fragment at 45 is the CH3CHOH+ ion (if there's an alcohol group), but that would imply an alcohol, but the IR shows a strong O-H which we thought was a carboxylic acid.

Putting this together:

- IR: Broad ~3000 (COOH), 1700 (C=O of COOH), 1650 (C=C)

- NMR: vinyl hydrogens (from the double bond)

- Mass spec: fragment at 45 (COOH+)

The formula must then be C6H10O2 (which has two DoU: one from the COOH and one from the double bond), which matches all the data.

Let me check the other options:

C6H12O: Only 1 DoU would require either a ring or a double bond. If there's a COOH, that would require two oxygen atoms (not C6H12O which has one O). So that's out.

C6H10O: One O, so not a carboxylic acid. Maybe a ketone and a double bond. Then IR would maybe have a carbonyl (1700 could be a ketone). The O-H is broad, so if it's an alcohol (but then molecular formula is C6H10O which would be an alcohol with DoU=2). Suppose it's cyclohexanol with a double bond... but maybe. However, its O-H stretch would be around 3300 and broad, but in this case the O-H is at 3000. Hmm, maybe not the best fit. Also, the second peak at 1650 (C=C). But if it's an alcohol and a ketone, that would require two oxygen atoms, but the formula is C6H10O which has only one O. So that's not possible. Ahem, a carbonyl (e.g., aldehyde or ketone) and a double bond in the molecule with one O. Maybe something like cyclohexenone, which would have a ketone (C=O) and double bond. But cyclohexenone has formula C6H8O (since it's cyclohexen-one). So that's H8, but our options are C6H10O. Not sure. Maybe not. Alternatively, some other structure.

But then there's a problem. The IR has both 1700 and 1650. If C=O and C=C. Without the O-H, though, then the broad peak maybe shouldn't be there. So we'd need an O-H group if it's carboxylic acid. So C6H10O can't form a carboxylic acid (needs O2). Thus, if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, O2 is needed, which is in the options C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. But C6H12O2 would have only one DoU, which is for the C=O, but would need another DoU from a ring or another double bond. If there's a ring and a carbonyl (as in cyclohexanecarboxylic acid), but then there wouldn't be vinyl hydrogens. But our NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so we need a double bond, not a ring. Thus, C6H12O2 can't have a double bond since that would use two DoU (1 for C=O and 1 for C=C), but its DoU is only 1. Therefore, only formula left is C6H10O2, which allows for two DoU (C=O and C=C), accounting for the IR peaks, the vinyl Hs in NMR, and the potential COOH+ fragment in mass spec.

Therefore, the answer should be C6H10O2.

3. C6H10O2: Same as above, since O doesn't affect DoU. DoU= (12+2-10)/2=2. So same as the previous.

4. C6H12O2: DoU=(12 +2 -12)/2=2/2=1. So one DoU.

# Anthropic completion

Looking at the chemical formula options (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2), I need to determine which corresponds to our unknown compound based on spectral analysis.

Let me first calculate the degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each possibility using the formula DoU = (2C + 2 - H)/2:

1. C6H12O: DoU = (2×6 + 2 - 12)/2 = 1 - indicating either a ring or a double bond
2. C6H10O: DoU = (12 + 2 - 10)/2 = 2 - suggesting two double bonds, a combination of one double bond and a ring, two rings, or a triple bond
3. C6H10O2: DoU = (12 + 2 - 10)/2 = 2 - same as previous (oxygen doesn't affect DoU)
4. C6H12O2: DoU = (12 + 2 - 12)/2 = 1 - indicating one degree of unsaturation

Examining the spectral evidence:

The FTIR spectrum shows:
- A very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹, suggesting O-H stretching with strong hydrogen bonding, characteristic of carboxylic acids
- Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, typical of carbonyl (C=O) stretching, potentially from a carboxylic acid
- Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹, indicative of a C=C double bond

The ¹H NMR confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, supporting the existence of a carbon-carbon double bond.

For the mass spectrum:
- A fragment at m/z=45 is observed, which could represent a COOH+ fragment (molecular weight: 12+16×2+1=45)

These spectral characteristics suggest the compound contains both a carboxylic acid group and a carbon-carbon double bond, which aligns with the structural features and mass spectrometry fragmentation pattern observed.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine which chemical formula matches this unknown compound by analyzing the provided spectral data. We'll begin by listing the information we have and then evaluate each detail gradually.

First, the potential formulas are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each, as this could be useful alongside the spectral data.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as: DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming there are no halogens or nitrogens present, the formula simplifies to DoU = (2*C + 2 - H)/2.

Calculating DoU for each formula:

1. C6H12O: (2*6 + 2 - 12)/2 = (14 - 12)/2 = 1. This indicates one degree of unsaturation, possibly a ring or a double bond.

2. C6H10O: (12 + 2 - 10)/2 = 4/2 = 2. This corresponds to 2 degrees of unsaturation; could involve two double bonds, one double bond and a ring, two rings, or a triple bond.

3. C6H10O2: Identical to the above since oxygen doesn't affect DoU. DoU = (12 + 2 - 10)/2 = 2, same as the previous result.

4. C6H12O2: DoU = (12 + 2 - 12)/2 = 2/2 = 1, so one degree of unsaturation.

Turning to the spectral data:

**FTIR:**
- A very broad absorption peak around ~3000 cm⁻¹: These broad peaks in the region around 3000 cm⁻¹ typically signify O-H stretching, commonly associated with carboxylic acids, alcohols, or possibly N-H. Given the absence of nitrogen, it likely indicates an O-H group. This broadness implies strong hydrogen bonding, characteristic of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) with broad O-H stretches in the range of 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. However, a peak at 3000 is also within the range for alcohols, yet the broadness suggests carboxylic acid. So, this very broad peak could indeed be from a carboxylic acid's O-H. Other peaks here will also provide insight.

- Strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹: A peak at 1700 is typical for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Depending on the precise position, this can suggest a ketone (~1715), aldehyde (~1725), ester (~1740-1760?), or carboxylic acid (~1700-1720). The 1700 peak might align with a carboxylic acid's carbonyl group. Meanwhile, the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak likely represents a C=C double bond stretch, suggesting the presence of both a carbonyl group (potentially from a carboxylic acid) and a double bond.

**1H NMR:**
- Signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, implying the presence of protons near a C=C double bond. These would exhibit specific coupling patterns, such as doublet of doublets, although specific splitting patterns aren't provided here—just their presence is noted.

**Mass Spec:**
- Fragment observed at m/z=45. Common fragments with a mass of 45 could be:
  - COOH+; however, a carboxylic acid group would lose an OH to form COOH+, which requires further thought: The molecular weight of COOH is 45 (12 + 16*2 +1 = 45). Alternatively, the fragment might be CH2CH2O+ (though this would be 44), or it could be the formate ion HCOO− (which has a mass of 1 + 12 + 16*2 = 45). If this is a carboxylic acid, it may shed the -COOH group as the molecular ion. Or, it might be another fragment appearing as the base peak at m/z = 45; this fragmentation is significant here. Let's identify other possible common m/z fragments:

- 45 could also be linked to a fragment like C2H5O+ (possibly CH2=CH-O-, although perhaps this suggests a carboxylic acid too).

Let me think again about common fragments. The m/z=45 is a key here. Search in mind: the fragment at 45 is often attributed to the carboxylic acid group (COOH+?), but (COOH is 45). Therefore, if the molecular ion loses a large fragment, but leaves COOH+, which is 45, which might suggest that the molecule has a carboxylic acid group as part of its structure. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid. Then, how does that fit with the formulas.\n\nLooking at the formulas provided: The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. A carboxylic acid would have the formula CnH2nO2. Let's check. For example, a carboxylic acid with n=5 would be C5H10O2, but the options include C6H10O2. Wait, wait. If the molecule is a cyclic compound or has a double bond along with the carboxylic acid, maybe. For example, a carboxylic acid with 5 carbons would be C5H10O2, but here we have C6H10O2. So in this case, maybe it's a C6 compound, a carboxylic acid with the formula C6H12O2 would be possible if there is one DoU. Wait, let's check the DoU for C6H12O2: as I did earlier, DoU=(2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So either a ring or a double bond. But FTIR shows a double bond (absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹), so a double bond and a carboxylic acid (with O-H), which together would contribute two DoU. But wait, C6H12O2 would have DoU=1. Wait, this seems conflicting. So let me check again. If formula is C6H10O2, the DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So 2 DoU. That could be a carboxylic acid (one DoU from COOH) and a double bond (another DoU). Then the formula would be C6H10O2.\n\nBut if the formula is C6H12O2, DoU=1. Then, having a carboxylic acid (which is one DoU), which would require having a double bond (another DoU), totaling 2, but if the formula only allows 1 DoU, that's conflicting. So this suggests that the molecule cannot be a carboxylic acid if the formula is C6H12O2. But if the formula is C6H10O2, then the two DoU can accommodate the carboxylic acid (1) and a double bond (1), which works.\n\nSo coming back, if the FTIR shows both O-H (carboxylic acid) at 3000 (more towards lower wavenumber, which is maybe because of dimeric form as in carboxylic acids), and carbonyl at 1700, which is also in line with carboxylic acid. Additionally, the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a C=C, which is another DoU.\n\nThe presence of vinyl Hs in the NMR supports the presence of a double bond.\n\nThe mass spec fragment at m/z=45 would then be COOH+ (45). So, if that's the case, the molecular formula would include a COOH group (which is -COOH, so O2) plus the rest. Let's say the molecule is a carboxylic acid with 5 carbons (pentanoic acid), but that's C5H10O2. Here, the formula would be C6, so maybe something like hexenoic acid. For example, 2-hexenoic acid would have the formula C6H10O2: CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. Let's count the H: 2 (from CH2=CH-) + 3*2 (three CH2 groups) + 2 (from COOH) = 2 +6 + 2=10. So yes, C6H10O2. That matches the DoU (1 from the double bond, 1 from the COOH, total 2). So that fits.\n\nTherefore, the formula is C6H10O2.\n\nWait, but let's check the other options. If the formula is C6H10O, then DoU=2. Could be maybe a ketone and a double bond, but FTIR would show a carbonyl at ~1700. But then O-H is missing. However, the FTIR here shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group, so without O-H, maybe an alcohol. Wait, an alcohol's O-H would be broad. But maybe a carboxylic acid. But if the formula is C6H10O, then O is only once. A carboxylic acid requires two O (since it's -COOH: O2). So, the O in C6H10O is once, so if the O is in, say, a ketone (C=O) and perhaps an alcohol (O-H), then how does the DoU work. But then O would be a part of both the carbonyl and the hydroxyl, but the formula is C6H10O. Let's see: The molecular formula would require one oxygen. So if it is an alcohol (with O-H) and a ketone (C=O, O), but then that would be two oxygens. But the formula only has one O. So that would not work. Therefore, the only way to have O-H and C=O signals is if the compound has two oxygen atoms. Hence, the possibilities are C6H10O2 or C6H12O2.\n\nBut, C6H12O2 would have DoU=1. But we have two features requiring DoU: C=O (carboxylic acid) and C=C, which is two DoU. Hence, C6H10O2 with DoU=2 is the correct choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C6H10O2.\n\nLet me verify the mass spec fragment again. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, then the molecular weight is (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16)=72 +10 +32=114. The molecular ion peak would be at 114. The fragment at 45 could be COOH+ (correct, 45) or maybe another fragment. If the molecule has a -COOH group, losing the rest (C5H9) would give COOH+ at 45. So when the molecule fragments, the carboxylic acid part breaks off, leaving the rest. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-(CH2)3-COOH, which is 2-pentenoic acid, then upon fragmentation, the COOH group could break off, leading to m/z=45. That seems plausible.\n\nPutting this all together, the compound has a carboxylic acid group (hence O2 in the formula), a double bond (C=C), and the molecular formula must be C6H10O2 to account for the degrees of unsaturation. The FTIR supports O-H and C=O and C=C, NMR supports vinyl hydrogens, and mass spec supports the COOH fragment. So the formula must be C6H10O2.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743844541, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2358, prompt_tokens=1050, total_tokens=3408, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The unknown compound can be identified as **C₆H₁₀O₂** based on the following analysis:

### **Key Spectral Data and Reasoning:**
1. **FTIR Spectrum:**
   - **Broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid (-COOH) due to strong hydrogen bonding.
   - **Peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹**: 
     - **1700 cm⁻¹**: Corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O), consistent with a carboxylic acid.
     - **1650 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a C=C double bond.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum:**
   - **Vinyl hydrogens observed**: Confirms the presence of a double bond (C=C), which supports the IR data.

3. **Mass Spectrometry:**
   - **Fragment at m/z = 45**: Matches the molecular weight of -COOH⁺ (45 g/mol), a characteristic fragment of carboxylic acids.

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**
   - For **C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = (2×6 + 2 − 10)/2 = 2. This accounts for:
     - **1 DoU from the carboxylic acid** (C=O + O-H).
     - **1 DoU from the double bond** (C=C).

### **Elimination of Other Options:**
- **C₆H₁₂O** and **C₆H₁₂O₂**: Both have only **1 DoU**, insufficient to explain the carboxylic acid (1 DoU) **and** the double bond (1 DoU).
- **C₆H₁₀O**: Only **1 oxygen atom**, inconsistent with the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which requires **2 oxygens**.

### **Conclusion:**
The compound is a **carboxylic acid** with a double bond, fitting the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This aligns with all spectral data: O-H and C=O (FTIR), vinyl hydrogens (¹H NMR), and the COOH⁺ fragment (mass spec).

**Answer:** \boxed{C_6H_{10}O_2}

 a carboxylic acid could lose H2O, but that leads to M-18. Alternatively, maybe cleavage next to the carbonyl. Alternatively, someone's molecular formula includes a fragment with 45. Let's think: what has a molecular weight of 45? The formula would be C2H5O+ (45). C2H5O could be an ethyl group attached to oxygen—perhaps as in CH2CH2OH+, but wait:

Wait, wait. Alternatively, the fragment might correspond to the protonated carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's the COOH group breaking off. A carboxylic acid (like acetic acid) would have a molecular ion, but its fragments: acetic acid (M=60) would lose a CH3COO· (59), but maybe that's not it. Alternatively, a propionic acid (M=74), but the molecular formulas here are C6 compounds. Hmm.

Alternatively, m/z=45 is a common fragment for compounds with an ethyl ester group, where the ester oxygen is involved. If we have an ester, maybe the fragment is OCH2CH3 (which is 59... no). Wait, another angle: If the molecular formula has multiple oxygen atoms, maybe a fragment includes an oxygen. For example, in methyl acetate, the fragment could be CH3CO+ at 43. Hmm.

Alternatively, in a molecule like ethyl acetoacetate, cleavage could lead to different fragments, but maybe that's too complicated.

Alternatively, if there's an alpha-hydroxy group or something. Let me think again about common fragments. The m/z=45 is a key here. Search in mind: the fragment at 45 is often attributed to the carboxylic acid group (COOH+?), but (COOH is 45). Therefore, if the molecular ion loses a large fragment, but leaves COOH+, which is 45, which might suggest that the molecule has a carboxylic acid group as part of its structure. So maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid. Then, how does that fit with the formulas.

Looking at the formulas provided: The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. A carboxylic acid would have the formula CnH2nO2. Let's check. For example, a carboxylic acid with n=5 would be C5H10O2, but the options include C6H10O2. Wait, wait. If the molecule is a cyclic compound or has a double bond along with the carboxylic acid, maybe. For example, a carboxylic acid with 5 carbons would be C5H10O2, but here we have C6H10O2. So in this case, maybe it's a C6 compound, a carboxylic acid with the formula C6H12O2 would be possible if there is one DoU. Wait, let's check the DoU for C6H12O2: as I did earlier, DoU=(2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So either a ring or a double bond. But FTIR shows a double bond (absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹), so a double bond and a carboxylic acid (with O-H), which together would contribute two DoU. But wait, C6H12O2 would have DoU=1. Wait, this seems conflicting. So let me check again. If formula is C6H10O2, the DoU is (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So 2 DoU. That could be a carboxylic acid (one DoU from COOH) and a double bond (another DoU). Then the formula would be C6H10O2.

But if the formula is C6H12O2, DoU=1. Then, having a carboxylic acid (which is one DoU), which would require having a double bond (another DoU), totaling 2, but if the formula only allows 1 DoU, that's conflicting. So this suggests that the molecule cannot be a carboxylic acid if the formula is C6H12O2. But if the formula is C6H10O2, then the two DoU can accommodate the carboxylic acid (1) and a double bond (1), which works.

So coming back, if the FTIR shows both O-H (carboxylic acid) at 3000 (more towards lower wavenumber, which is maybe because of dimeric form as in carboxylic acids), and carbonyl at 1700, which is also in line with carboxylic acid. Additionally, the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a C=C, which is another DoU.

The presence of vinyl Hs in the NMR supports the presence of a double bond.

The mass spec fragment at m/z=45 would then be COOH+ (45). So, if that's the case, the molecular formula would include a COOH group (which is -COOH, so O2) plus the rest. Let's say the molecule is a carboxylic acid with 5 carbons (pentanoic acid), but that's C5H10O2. Here, the formula would be C6, so maybe something like hexenoic acid. For example, 2-hexenoic acid would have the formula C6H10O2: CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. Let's count the H: 2 (from CH2=CH-) + 3*2 (three CH2 groups) + 2 (from COOH) = 2 +6 + 2=10. So yes, C6H10O2. That matches the DoU (1 from the double bond, 1 from the COOH, total 2). So that fits.

Therefore, the formula is C6H10O2.

Wait, but let's check the other options. If the formula is C6H10O, then DoU=2. Could be maybe a ketone and a double bond, but FTIR would show a carbonyl at ~1700. But then O-H is missing. However, the FTIR here shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group, so without O-H, maybe an alcohol. Wait, an alcohol's O-H would be broad. But maybe a carboxylic acid.

So, the O in C6H10O is once, so if the O is in, say, a ketone (C=O) and perhaps an alcohol (O-H), then how does the DoU work. But then O would be a part of both the carbonyl and the hydroxyl, but the formula is C6H10O. Let's see: The molecular formula would require one oxygen. So if it is an alcohol (with O-H) and a ketone (C=O, O), but then that would be two oxygens. But the formula only has one O. So that would not work. Therefore, the only way to have O-H and C=O signals is if the compound has two oxygen atoms. Hence, the possibilities are C6H10O2 or C6H12O2.

But, C6H12O2 would have DoU=1. But we have two features requiring DoU: C=O (carboxylic acid) and C=C, which is two DoU. Hence, C6H10O2 with DoU=2 is the correct choice.

Therefore, the answer should be C6H10O2.

Let me verify the mass spec fragment again. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, then the molecular weight is (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16)=72 +10 +32=114. The molecular ion peak would be at 114. The fragment at 45 could be COOH+ (correct, 45) or maybe another fragment. If the molecule has a -COOH group, losing the rest (C5H9) would give COOH+ at 45. So when the molecule fragments, the carboxylic acid part breaks off, leaving the rest. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-(CH2)3-COOH, which is 2-pentenoic acid, then upon fragmentation, the COOH group could break off, leading to m/z=45. That seems plausible.

Putting this all together, the compound has a carboxylic acid group (hence O2 in the formula), a double bond (C=C), and the molecular formula must be C6H10O2 to account for the degrees of unsaturation. The FTIR supports O-H and C=O and C=C, NMR supports vinyl hydrogens, and mass spec supports the COOH fragment. So the formula must be C6H10O2.

Examining the formulas:
A carboxylic acid would have the formula RCOOH, which adds two oxygen atoms. The presence of a double bond (from the DoU) then requires the proper DoU. Let's analyze each candidate:

- C6H10O2: DoU=2. Assuming RCOOH (which uses two oxygen atoms and contributes one DoU from a carbonyl group), the remaining structure (R) would be C4H9 needing one DoU (since H for C4H10 is 10, so C4H9 would have H-count 9? Wait, perhaps needing to verify the structure better. Let's think of C6H10O2 as a carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid is C2H4O2 (since it's COOH with R being H). If the compound is C6H10O2, then the rest is C5H10O. Wait, maybe I need to approach it as CnH2nO2 for a saturated carboxylic acid (n is number of carbons). For hexanoic acid, the formula is C6H12O2. Here, the unknown has C6H10O2, which would be a hexenoic acid (with one double bond), providing two degrees of unsaturation (one from COOH and one from C=C). That fits with DoU=2 for C6H10O2. Alternatively, perhaps the mass spec's m/z=45 (COOH+) supports a carboxylic acid group. Then the presence of a double bond (vin H in NMR) would require the DoU. So combining, formula is C6H10O2. 

Alternatively, maybe other possibilities: The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak could also be an ester (C=O) plus another oxygen. If it were an ester, then the formula would require at least two oxygen atoms. But the FTIR's broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ points more toward an -OH group (like carboxylic acid, not ester which usually has no O-H). 

So putting it all together:

Carboxylic acid group (COOH) accounts for one DoU (C=O) and two oxygen atoms, a double bond in the hydrocarbon chain provides another DoU. The formula C6H10O2 would have DoU = (12 + 2 -10)/2 = 2. So two DoUs: one from the acid, one from double bond.

Therefore, the chemical formula should be C6H10O2.

For carboxylic acids, the molecular ion often loses the -COOH (45 would be the carboxylic group if fragmented as M - R, giving COOH... mm, for instance, in formic acid (HCOOH, MW 46), but losing a hydrogen would get us 45. Alternatively, in acetic acid (CH3COOH, MW 60), if the CH3CO- breaks off, but details matter here. Alternatively, the m/z might not be the molecular ion but a fragment. Let's see: For example, if the molecular ion loses a COOH group: but the related fragment would be M - 45. However, fragment at m/z=45 would be the COOH group? If so, the structure must contain COOH. Also, in many cases, the cleavage of the bond adjacent to carboxylic acid could lead to the formation of the acylium ion, which could be lower in mass.

So cannot be a carboxylic acid (O=2). So if the IR shows O-H broad (from carb acid necessitating O=2), then that makes C6H12O and C6H10O invalid.

Let's compare their DoU:\n\nC6H10O2: DoU=(2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2.\n\nC6H12O2: DoU=(14-12)/2=1.\n\nSo, according to the degrees of unsaturation:\n\nThe compound must have a C=O (one DoU) and a C=C (another DoU), totaling 2 degrees of unsaturation.

Alternatively, but given that the IR shows a carbonyl and a double bond, so two DoU (one from each) would require the formula to have DoU=2, hence C6H10O2.\n\nBut also, looking at the mass spec data: fragment m/z=45. For a compound with formula C6H10O2, if it's a carboxylic acid, like pentenoic acid (maybe 3-pentenoic acid?), then molecular weight would be: 6*12 + 10*1 + 16*2=72+10+32=114. If fragmented, the COOH would be 45, so the remaining segment would be 69 (114-45=69). Hmm. However, if the molecular ion breaks such that the fragment ion is COOH^+, then m/z=45, which is possible.\n\nAlternatively, in other compounds with OAc group, perhaps having OCH2CH3 or similar.\n\nBut assuming the presence of O-H (carboxylic acid), C=O and C=C bonds, the compound is likely alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, 2-pentenoic acid (if C5H8O2) but since we need C6, maybe 3-hexenoic acid, which would have formula C6H10O2 (because COOH adds two oxygens and the formula would be C6H10O2 if the rest is C5H9}.\n\nThus, degrees of unsaturation would be 2 (from C=O and C=C). Upon considering the molecular formula candidates, this supports C6H10O2.\n\nAdditionally, mass spec fragment at 45: The possible loss of the carboxylic acid group would lead to M-COOH fragment. Wait, but if the molecular ion is the molecular weight of the compound. If the compound is C6H10O2 (MW=6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114), the main peak in mass would be 114 (if not fragmented). But fragmentation could lead to the loss of fragments. However, if the molecular ion loses COOH (45), the remaining fragment would be 114 - 45 =69 (C5H9 ?). But another possibility is that the fragment produced is the COOH part, which would be m/z=45. Alternatively, if the compound is not a carboxylic acid but an ester, maybe the fragment is different.\n\nWait, carboxylic acids may not tend to lose COOH as a fragment. Let's check another perspective. The fischer esterification reaction: Esters. If, instead, the functional group were an ester (which has C=O). Then, the broad peak in IR may not be O-H but maybe an alcohol or something else. However, in original IR data, the strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 also proposed. If the IR shows a broad O-H, maybe from an alcohol. Wait ambiguity here. Let me think again. If the O-H is broad, but there are 1700 and 1650 peaks.\n\nWait, carb acids would have a broad O-H (due to strong hydrogen bonding), and the C=O stretch around 1700. Then the other peak at 1650 is the C=C stretching. That would make sense.\n\nIn that case, the structure may be an unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example:\n\nCH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH (4-hexenoic acid), but carbon count: could that fit? Let's see, that would have 6 carbons (the COOH is one carbon; so five in the chain plus one from the COOH gives six). In any case, molecular formula is C6H10O2. The increment in double bonds lowers the H count. So the formula matches.\n\nThe other option is if the compound is cyclic. For example, cyclohexene ring with a COOH group. But a cyclohexene has a double bond (one DoU), COOH (another DoU), totaling 2, aligning with C6H10O2. Such structures are possible.\n\nBut then, how do we rationalize the mass spec fragment at m/z=45? If the compound loses COOH (45), the remaining would need to be C5H9. I'm not sure. Suppose the molecular ion peak is at m/z=114 (C6H10O2), and there is a fragment at m/z=45. That would require the young chemical losing a fragment of 69 (114 -45). Alternatively, the fragment m/z=45 corresponds to the -COOH group, but let's confirm.\n\nFor example, propanoic acid (C3H6O2) has a molecular weight of 74. If the molecular ion is at m/z=74, a possible fragment losing COOH (45) would leave a M-45= 74-45=29 (C2H5+). However, commonly in propanoic acid, the acylium fragment might be at  m/z=73 (losing -H), and then other fragments.\n\nIf for 3-pentenoic acid (which we deduced as C5H8O2?), but in this case, the compound given in options is C6). Wait, original options are C6H10O2. For example, 4-pentenoic acid would be. Ah, not getting the correct one, but perhaps M could be 114, as I calculated earlier. However, when assessing the breaking of bonds, for example, a C-C bond adjacent to the COOH group would lead to fragments. For instance, cleavage between the alpha and beta carbons would produce COOH+ (45) and the remaining (114-45=69). Alternatively, if the compound contains a gamma,delta unsaturation (or any internal double bond), but that's getting into specifics.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the m/z=45 corresponds to the fragment -COO- with a hydrogen. Wait, if the compound is an ester, say ethyl propionate, but I'm getting off track.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of water (18) or other small molecules, but getting 66 when starting from 64 after other loss. Alternatively, let me think of another compound with COOH group and possible fragment m/z=45.\n\nWait, another possibility: glycine. But glycine is NH2CH2COOH, which is not in our molecular formula options. So perhaps more applicable is the m/z=45 could be forming from a different origin.\n\nWait, let's think about the fragment CH2CH2O (as I thought earlier). For example, ethyl groups. But calculations: OCH2CH3 would have m/z=45? Let's calculate: 16(O) + 12*2 (two C's) + 5*H (C2H5O? Therefore, 16 +24 +5=45. Yes. So OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) would have a molecular weight of 45.\n\nSo, an ethoxy group as a fragment. But that would require the compound to be an ester, like ethyl something. But for an ethylene adjacent group? Alternatively, if it's a COOEt group (ester): but in that case, what would happen in IR? Carbonyl peak around 1740 cm-1. Wait the IR here shows a peak at 1700 cm-1, which in esters would be perhaps a different stretch. If there's an ester, then the carbonyl peak is ~1740, so 1700 might be a different structure, maybe conjugated. Alternatively, the presence of a conjugated carbonyl group (like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester) could lower the wavenumber. However, this starts to complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, the key here may be to recognize commonly known fragments with m/z=45. Doing a bit of recall: The fragment at 45 in mass spectrometry is often associated with the carboxy group (COOH^+) as previously noted. When a carboxylic acid loses the R group, leaving the COOH fragment with MW 45 (12 + 16*2 + 1 = 45). Thus, if the mass spectum shows a peak at 45, it's indicative of a molecule with a COOH group. So If that's the case, the presence of the COOH group (also supported by the IR data's broad absorption around 3000 cm-1, and the 1700 peak for C=O) strongly suggests a carboxylic acid.\n\nWith that in mind, possible candidates are the formulas with two oxygens: C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. However, based on DoU calculated before:\n\n- C6H10O2 has DoU=2 (needs two unsats, one from C=O and another from C=C), which aligns with the spectral info (since NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens [i.e., presence of a double bond] and IR indicates a carbonyl group and a double bond). Alternatively, if the IR shows two possible carbonyl groups, but one is C=O and the other C=C, which could account for two degrees of unsat.. Because two strong absorption peaks at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (C=C), conforming degrees of unsat would require the formula to have two DoU. Given that, the formula must be C6H10O2 since it has two degrees of unsaturation. C6H12O2 has only 1 DoU (so one ring or a single double bond) whereas the spectral data seems to require two.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond (C=C, so one degree of unsaturation). The carboxylic acid group (COOH) would account for another (the C=O as another degree of unsaturation). So two DoU for the molecule. Thus, only C6H10O2 fits both the oxygen count and the DoU required. Whereas C6H12O2, with only 1 DoU, would have only one double bond, for example, but the compound would then have 1 DoU (say, cyclohexane acetic acid? but then structure would be cyclohexyl group but then C6H12O2 but that would require with [cyclohexyl (DoU1) and COOH (another DoU)], but if cyclohexyl, that is C6H11, plus COOH (C O2 H2 O2) Would the formula be? Wait, perhaps, the entire formula becomes for cyclohexane carboxylic acid: C6H11COOH would be C7H12O2. No, but in our options, the formula options have 6 carbons. So perhaps the correct structural idea is something different.\n\nAlternatively, anoate groups: another possibility is a cyclic ester, but that's a stretch. Returning to the possible structure. Assuming the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, a structure like CH2=CH-C(O)OH where the rest is a four-carbon chain. Wait: but putting this together. Let's try:\n\n- COOH group (O2, hence fits C6H10O2 or C6H12O2?): CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. This would have 6 carbons (the COOH is counted as one carbon). The formula? Let's count: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. C in COOH: 1; then CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but with a double bond):\n\nStructurally:\n\nCH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH. So for this structure, the molecule has:\n\nCOOH (one C), then four more carbons with a double bond (positions 1 and 2). So:\n\nDouble bond (1), COOH (another degree) — total 2 DoU. The formula would be:\n\n6 carbons: check.\n\nHydrogens: the structure (when unwinding), considering the double bond (each double bond reduces two H).\n\nCOH= let's tabulate each group:\n\nCOOH (two H: -COOH group except for OH, which is oxygen-bound perhaps not counted in H count), then CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-.\n\nSo the part before COOH is CH2=CHCH2CH2-:\n\nHydrogens in that chain: CH2=CHCH2CH2- would have:\n\nEach CH2=CH has four H (each CH2 would contribute two H, but double bond between CH2 and CH, but depending on structure, okay). Let me write their possible formula.\n\nActually, but maybe a better approach is to calculate (since requiring the formula C6H10O2):\n\nIf it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond.\n\nMolecular formula RCOOH, where R is a C5H9 group with one double bond (since the R needs to account for (C5H9) + COOH (which is 1 carbon but contributes 2 oxygens). Hence, the compound is CnH2n-1COOH.\n\nWait, R=C(n), group with (n) carbons. Then, combined with COOH, the carbons are n +1. For this case, any how, we need 6 carbons. Hence, R must be C5. So the formula becomes C5H9-COOH? So, R is C5H9 (since with a double bond, H would be 5*2 - 2 (due to double bond) +1 [-1? may need to calculate differently: if R is C5H9, with one double bond, example, R would have phenyl or involve rings. Let me clarify via the formula. For R being a five-carbon chain:\n\nIf R is alkenyl (say, straight-chain):\n\nFor a 5-carbon alkenyl group (with one double bond degree of unsaturation), the formula would be. For an alkene, alkyl group: CnH2n+1-(something.\n\nAlternatively For pentenyl group (C5H9). If the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, which is ethene connectivity here (? Not sure). Alternatively:\n\nAnother example: 3-pentenoic acid: CH2CH2CH=CHCOOH. Wait, actually, 3-pentenoic acid would have 5 carbons (as the COOH is the first carbon? )\n\nI think confusion arises from the IUPAC numbering. Irrespective, this is becoming overly complex. However, the key takeaways are that the formula must be C6H10O2 due to two DoU (from a carbonyl and a double bond), evidence of O-H (carboxylic acid), which necessitates two oxygen atoms, and the mass fragment at m/z=45 (COOH), alongside all other spectral data. Hence, the correct solution should be C6H10O2.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743844676, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4357, prompt_tokens=1048, total_tokens=5405, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

The unknown compound can be identified as **C₆H₁₀O₂** based on the following analysis:

1. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):**  
   For C₆H₁₀O₂:  
   \[
   \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = 2
   \]  
   This matches the structural requirements of **two degrees of unsaturation** (one from the C=O group and one from the C=C bond), as indicated by the IR peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O) and 1650 cm⁻¹ (C=C).

2. **FTIR Analysis:**  
   - The **very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹** is characteristic of an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid (-COOH).  
   - The **strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹** confirms a carbonyl group (C=O), consistent with a carboxylic acid.  
   - The **absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹** indicates a vinyl C=C bond, corroborated by the NMR data showing vinyl hydrogens.

3. **¹H NMR Data:**  
   Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** confirm the presence of a double bond (C=C), aligning with one of the two required degrees of unsaturation.

4. **Mass Spectrometry:**  
   The fragment at **m/z = 45** corresponds to the loss of a -COOH group (mass = 45), which is typical for carboxylic acids. This supports the presence of a carboxylic acid moiety in the structure.

5. **Elimination of Other Options:**  
   - **C₆H₁₂O** and **C₆H₁₀O** contain only one oxygen atom, insufficient for a carboxylic acid (which requires two oxygen atoms).  
   - **C₆H₁₂O₂** has only one degree of unsaturation, inconsistent with the observed C=O and C=C bonds (two degrees of unsaturation).

**Conclusion:**  
The compound is **C₆H₁₀O₂**, an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid or a structurally similar compound containing both a carboxylic acid group and a double bond.

 Alternatively, if there's an ethoxyl group (like OCH2CH3), but then if -OCH2CH3 breaks off, 45 would be the m/z for that. Wait: CH3CH2O has molecular weight (12*2 + 1*5 +16)= 24 +5 +16 =45. So, maybe OCH2CH3 as a fragment? But if it's part of an ester, perhaps. For carboxylic acids, the molecular ion often loses the -COOH (45 would be the carboxylic group if fragmented as M - R, giving COOH... mm, for instance, in formic acid (HCOOH, MW 46), but losing a hydrogen would get us 45. Alternatively, in acetic acid (CH3COOH, MW 60), if the CH3CO- breaks off, but details matter here. Alternatively, the m/z might not be the molecular ion but a fragment. Let's see: For example, if the molecular ion loses a COOH group: but the related fragment would be M - 45. However, fragment at m/z=45 would be the COOH group? If so, the structure must contain COOH. Also, in many cases, the cleavage of the bond adjacent to carboxylic acid could lead to the formation of the acylium ion, which could be lower in mass. But perhaps a more common fragment for m/z=45 is the CH3CHOH+ or similar, though that may not be a common fragment. Alternatively, might the compound be methyl acetate? Let me put mass analysis on hold for a moment.

Other thoughts: Combining the IR data—broad peak (O-H of carboxylic acid), strong peak at 1700 (C=O of carboxylic acid), and another peak at 1650 (C=C). So, the compound could be an unsaturated carboxylic acid.

Possible structure: for example, a cyclohexenecarboxylic acid? Or a longer chain with a double bond and a COOH group.

But looking at the molecular formula options: the possible options are:

C6H12O, C6H10O: Doesn't have enough oxygen for a carboxylic acid (which requires O2). So possible formula with two oxygens would include C6H10O2 or C6H12O2.

But wait:

Carboxylic acid has COOH, so the formula would be RCOOH: so it would require two oxygen atoms. Therefore, the compound would need O2. So among the options, the possible formulas with two oxygens are C6H10O2 or C6H12O2.

So let's eliminate the others:

C6H12O: O=1. So cannot be a carboxylic acid (O=2). So if the IR shows O-H broad (from carb acid necessitating O=2), then that makes C6H12O and C6H10O invalid. Therefore, the possible candidates are C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.

Now, we face between these two. Let's compare their DoU:

C6H10O2: DoU=(2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2.

C6H12O2: DoU=(14-12)/2=1.

So, according to the degrees of unsaturation:

The compound must have a C=O (one DoU) and a C=C (another DoU), totaling 2 degrees of unsaturation. So the formula must have DoU=2, pointing towards C6H10O2.

So C6H10O2: cyclohexane? No, but with two DoU maybe a six-membered ring plus a ketone but wait. Alternatively, but given that the IR shows a carbonyl and a double bond, so two DoU (one from each) would require the formula to have DoU=2, hence C6H10O2.

But also, looking at the mass spec data: fragment m/z=45. For a compound with formula C6H10O2, if it's a carboxylic acid, like pentenoic acid (maybe 3-pentenoic acid?), then molecular weight would be: 6*12 + 10*1 + 16*2=72+10+32=114. If fragmented, the COOH would be 45, so the remaining segment would be 69 (114-45=69). Hmm. However, if the molecular ion breaks such that the fragment ion is COOH^+, then m/z=45, which is possible.

Alternatively, in other compounds with OAc group, perhaps having OCH2CH3 or similar.

But assuming the presence of O-H (carboxylic acid), C=O and C=C bonds, the compound is likely alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, 2-pentenoic acid (if C5H8O2) but since we need C6, maybe 3-hexenoic acid, which would have formula C6H10O2 (because COOH adds two oxygens and the formula would be C6H10O2 if the rest is C5H9}.

Thus, degrees of unsaturation would be 2 (from C=O and C=C). Upon considering the molecular formula candidates, this supports C6H10O2.

Additionally, mass spec fragment at 45: The possible loss of the carboxylic acid group would lead to M-COOH fragment. Wait, but if the molecular ion is the molecular weight of the compound. If the compound is C6H10O2 (MW=6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114), the main peak in mass would be 114 (if not fragmented). But fragmentation could lead to the loss of fragments. However, if the molecular ion loses COOH (45), the remaining fragment would be 114 - 45 =69 (C5H9 ?). But another possibility is that the fragment produced is the COOH part, which would be m/z=45. Alternatively, if the compound is not a carboxylic acid but an ester, maybe the fragment is different.

Wait, carboxylic acids may not tend to lose COOH as a fragment. Let's check another perspective. The fischer esterification reaction: Esters. If, instead, the functional group were an ester (which has C=O). Then, the broad peak in IR may not be O-H but maybe an alcohol or something else. However, in original IR data, the strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 also proposed. If the IR shows a broad O-H, maybe from an alcohol. Wait ambiguity here. Let me think again. If the O-H is broad, but there are 1700 and 1650 peaks.

Wait, carb acids would have a broad O-H (due to strong hydrogen bonding), and the C=O stretch around 1700. Then the other peak at 1650 is the C=C stretching. That would make sense.

In that case, the structure may be an unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example:

CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH (4-hexenoic acid), but carbon count: could that fit? Let's see, that would have 6 carbons (the COOH is one carbon; so five in the chain plus one from the COOH gives six). In any case, molecular formula is C6H10O2. The increment in double bonds lowers the H count. So the formula matches.

The other option is if the compound is cyclic. For example, cyclohexene ring with a COOH group. But a cyclohexene has a double bond (one DoU), COOH (another DoU), totaling 2, aligning with C6H10O2. Such structures are possible.

But then, how do we rationalize the mass spec fragment at m/z=45? If the compound loses COOH (45), the remaining would need to be C5H9. I'm not sure. Suppose the molecular ion peak is at m/z=114 (C6H10O2), and there is a fragment at m/z=45. That would require the young chemical losing a fragment of 69 (114 -45). Alternatively, the fragment m/z=45 corresponds to the -COOH group, but let's confirm.

For example, propanoic acid (C3H6O2) has a molecular weight of 74. If the molecular ion is at m/z=74, a possible fragment losing COOH (45) would leave a M-45= 74-45=29 (C2H5+). However, commonly in propanoic acid, the acylium fragment might be at  m/z=73 (losing -H), and then other fragments.

If for 3-pentenoic acid (which we deduced as C5H8O2?), but in this case, the compound given in options is C6). Wait, original options are C6H10O2. For example, 4-pentenoic acid would be. Ah, not getting the correct one, but perhaps M could be 114, as I calculated earlier. However, when assessing the breaking of bonds, for example, a C-C bond adjacent to the COOH group would lead to fragments. For instance, cleavage between the alpha and beta carbons would produce COOH+ (45) and the remaining (114-45=69). Alternatively, if the compound contains a gamma,delta unsaturation (or any internal double bond), but that's getting into specifics.

Alternatively, another approach: the m/z=45 corresponds to the fragment -COO- with a hydrogen. Wait, if the compound is an ester, say ethyl propionate, but I'm getting off track.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of water (18) or other small molecules, but getting 66 when starting from 64 after other loss. Alternatively, let me think of another compound with COOH group and possible fragment m/z=45.

Wait, another possibility: glycine. But glycine is NH2CH2COOH, which is not in our molecular formula options. So perhaps more applicable is the m/z=45 could be forming from a different origin.

Wait, let's think about the fragment CH2CH2O (as I thought earlier). For example, ethyl groups. But calculations: OCH2CH3 would have m/z=45? Let's calculate: 16(O) + 12*2 (two C's) + 5*H (C2H5O? Therefore, 16 +24 +5=45. Yes. So OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) would have a molecular weight of 45.

So, an ethoxy group as a fragment. But that would require the compound to be an ester, like ethyl something. But for an ethylene adjacent group? Alternatively, if it's a COOEt group (ester): but in that case, what would happen in IR? Carbonyl peak around 1740 cm-1. Wait the IR here shows a peak at 1700 cm-1, which in esters would be perhaps a different stretch. If there's an ester, then the carbonyl peak is ~1740, so 1700 might be a different structure, maybe conjugated. Alternatively, the presence of a conjugated carbonyl group (like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester) could lower the wavenumber. However, this starts to complicate things.

Alternatively, the key here may be to recognize commonly known fragments with m/z=45. Doing a bit of recall: The fragment at 45 in mass spectrometry is often associated with the carboxy group (COOH^+) as previously noted. When a carboxylic acid loses the R group, leaving the COOH fragment with MW 45 (12 + 16*2 + 1 = 45). Thus, if the mass spectum shows a peak at 45, it's indicative of a molecule with a COOH group. So If that's the case, the presence of the COOH group (also supported by the IR data's broad absorption around 3000 cm-1, and the 1700 peak for C=O) strongly suggests a carboxylic acid.

With that in mind, possible candidates are the formulas with two oxygens: C6H10O2 and C6H12O2. However, based on DoU calculated before:

- C6H10O2 has DoU=2 (needs two unsats, one from C=O and another from C=C), which aligns with the spectral info (since NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens [i.e., presence of a double bond] and IR indicates a carbonyl group and a double bond). Alternatively, if the IR shows two possible carbonyl groups, but one is C=O and the other C=C, which could account for two degrees of unsat.. Because two strong absorption peaks at 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (C=C), conforming degrees of unsat would require the formula to have two DoU. Given that, the formula must be C6H10O2 since it has two degrees of unsaturation. C6H12O2 has only 1 DoU (so one ring or a single double bond) whereas the spectral data seems to require two.

So, putting it all together:

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond (C=C, so one degree of unsaturation). The carboxylic acid group (COOH) would account for another (the C=O as another degree of unsaturation). So two DoU for the molecule. Thus, only C6H10O2 fits both the oxygen count and the DoU required. Whereas C6H12O2, with only 1 DoU, would have only one double bond, for example, but the compound would then have 1 DoU (say, cyclohexane acetic acid? but then structure would be cyclohexyl group but then C6H12O2 but that would require with [cyclohexyl (DoU1) and COOH (another DoU)], but if cyclohexyl, that is C6H11, plus COOH (C O2 H2 O2) Would the formula be? Wait, perhaps, the entire formula becomes for cyclohexane carboxylic acid: C6H11COOH would be C7H12O2. No, but in our options, the formula options have 6 carbons. So perhaps the correct structural idea is something different.

Alternatively, anoate groups: another possibility is a cyclic ester, but that's a stretch. Returning to the possible structure. Assuming the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. For example, a structure like CH2=CH-C(O)OH where the rest is a four-carbon chain. Wait: but putting this together. Let's try:

- COOH group (O2, hence fits C6H10O2 or C6H12O2?): CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. This would have 6 carbons (the COOH is counted as one carbon). The formula? Let's count: CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. C in COOH: 1; then CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but with a double bond):

Structurally:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-COOH. So for this structure, the molecule has:

COOH (one C), then four more carbons with a double bond (positions 1 and 2). So:

Double bond (1), COOH (another degree) — total 2 DoU. The formula would be:

6 carbons: check.

Hydrogens: the structure (when unwinding), considering the double bond (each double bond reduces two H).

COH= let's tabulate each group:

COOH (two H: -COOH group except for OH, which is oxygen-bound perhaps not counted in H count), then CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-.

So the part before COOH is CH2=CHCH2CH2-:

Hydrogens in that chain: CH2=CHCH2CH2- would have:

Each CH2=CH has four H (each CH2 would contribute two H, but double bond between CH2 and CH, but depending on structure, okay). Let me write their possible formula.

Actually, but maybe a better approach is to calculate (since requiring the formula C6H10O2):

If it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

Molecular formula RCOOH, where R is a C5H9 group with one double bond (since the R needs to account for (C5H9) + COOH (which is 1 carbon but contributes 2 oxygens). Hence, the compound is CnH2n-1COOH.

Wait, R=C(n), group with (n) carbons. Then, combined with COOH, the carbons are n +1. For this case, any how, we need 6 carbons. Hence, R must be C5. So the formula becomes C5H9-COOH? So, R is C5H9 (since with a double bond, H would be 5*2 - 2 (due to double bond) +1 [-1? may need to calculate differently: if R is C5H9, with one double bond, example, R would have phenyl or involve rings. Let me clarify via the formula. For R being a five-carbon chain:

If R is alkenyl (say, straight-chain):

For a 5-carbon alkenyl group (with one double bond degree of unsaturation), the formula would be. For an alkene, alkyl group: CnH2n+1-(something.

Alternatively For pentenyl group (C5H9). If the molecule is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, which is ethene connectivity here (? Not sure). Alternatively:

Another example: 3-pentenoic acid: CH2CH2CH=CHCOOH. Wait, actually, 3-pentenoic acid would have 5 carbons (as the COOH is the first carbon? )

I think confusion arises from the IUPAC numbering. Irrespective, this is becoming overly complex. However, the key takeaways are that the formula must be C6H10O2 due to two DoU (from a carbonyl and a double bond), evidence of O-H (carboxylic acid), which necessitates two oxygen atoms, and the mass fragment at m/z=45 (COOH), alongside all other spectral data. Hence, the correct solution should be C6H10O2.
