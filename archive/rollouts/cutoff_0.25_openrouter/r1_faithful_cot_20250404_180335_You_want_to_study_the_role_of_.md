# Original Question

You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

The inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein in the transgenic construct is due to **a premature stop codon (TGA) introduced immediately after the HA tag sequence**, truncating the translation of the recombinant protein. Here's the breakdown:

1. **HA Tag Translation**:  
   The HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) is encoded correctly at the N-terminus:  
   - **ATG** (M, start codon) -> **TAC** (Y) -> **CCA** (P) -> **TAC** (Y) -> **GAT** (D) -> **GTT** (V) -> **CCA** (P) -> **GAT** (D) -> **TAC** (Y) -> **GCC** (A).

2. **Premature Stop Codon**:  
   After the HA tag sequence, two additional codons were erroneously included:  
   - **AAA** (Lys) -> **TGA** (Stop).  
   This causes translation to terminate prematurely, resulting in a truncated peptide (MYPYDVPDYAK) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein fused to the HA tag.

3. **Consequence**:  
   The stop codon prevents translation of the downstream GADD45G coding sequence. Since only the short HA-tagged peptide is produced (which is likely unstable or undetectable), the overexpression of the full-length protein fails.

4. **Likely Cause**:  
   The error likely originated during cloning (e.g., primer design or ligation). Extra nucleotides (AAA TGA) were introduced between the HA tag and GADD45G, possibly from a misdesigned linker, restriction site, or PCR artifact.

**Solution**:  
Remove the AAA TGA sequence to fuse the HA tag in-frame with the GADD45G coding sequence, ensuring the absence of intervening stop codons. Verify the construct by sequencing and re-test expression.

Okay, so the problem here is that they tried to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, which has an HA tag at the N-terminus. After cloning the plasmid and transfecting CHO cells, they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies but found that the protein isn't being overexpressed as expected. Now they looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and need to figure out what went wrong.

The given plus strand is 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'.

First thing I want to do is translate the DNA sequence to see what the protein looks like. Maybe there's a premature stop codon or a frameshift. Since it’s a coding sequence for GADD45G with an HA tag (which is a small peptide tag, usually around 9 amino acids: YPYDVPDYA, from the HA epitope), the N-terminus should have that sequence. Let's start by translating the given DNA.

The plus strand is 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be same as the plus strand except T becomes U. So I can transcribe the DNA to mRNA and then translate it. The start codon is ATG (which is the first three nucleotides, ATG), so that's methionine.

Let me take the DNA sequence starting from ATG.

Let me break it down. The sequence is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGG AAA GCG CTG CAT GAG TTG CTG CTG TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC CTC ACT GCC GGC GTC TAC GAG TCA GCC AAA GTC TTG AAC GTG GAC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC TGT GTG CTG GCT GCG GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TTC TGC TGC GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CCG GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC AAC GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCC TTG GAG AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA

Translating this:

Start with ATG (M), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (Stop).

Wait, this is early on. Let me check that. The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...

So:

Position 1-3: ATG = M

4-6: TAC = Y

7-9: CCA = P

10-12: TAT = Y (Wait, wait, the DNA sequence here is TAC. In the original written sequence, it's "C" when reading 5' to 3'? Let me check:

Original DNA sequence: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Let me parse the first few codons:

Starting from first ATG (positions 1-3)

4-6: TAC (Y)

7-9: CCA (P)

10-12: TAC (Y), because it's TAC at positions 10-12. Then 13-15: GAT (D), etc.

So next, continuing from TAC (positions 10-12):

13-15: GAT (D)

16-18: GTT (V)

19-21: CCA (P)

22-24: GAT (D)

25-27: TAC (Y)

28-30: GCC (A)

31-33: AAA (K)

34-36: TGA (Stop)

Wait, hold on. So after positions 1-33 (start codon to AAA (K) is 31033?), but then positions 34-36 are TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh, wait, start from the beginning:

Sequence: 

Positions:

1-3: ATG (M)

4-6: TAC (Y)

7-9: CCA (P)

10-12: TAC (Y)

13-15: GAT (D)

16-18: GTT (V)

19-21: CCA (P)

22-24: GAT (D)

25-27: TAC (Y)

28-30: GCC (A)

31-33: AAA (K)

34-36: TGA (stop)

Oh! That's a problem! So the HA tag is supposed to be added as the N-terminal tag, but the coding sequence includes a premature stop codon immediately after. The HA tag is generally the sequence YPYDVPDYA. Let's check that.

The HA tag nucleotide sequence is usually: TATCCGTACGATGTGCCGGACTACGCT (or some variation, but encoding YPYDVPDYA). Let’s see.

Wait, the user mentioned that they added the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant (HA tag) at the N-terminus. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is typically YP YDV PDYA. Let's see the first part of the protein.

The start codon is ATG, which is methionine. Then the HA tag should follow. The first amino acids after MET should be the HA tag. So for HA tag: YP YDV PDYA; the amino acids would be YPYDVPDYA. Let's see the translation of the given sequence. After M, the first few aas:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

So in amino acids:

M Y P Y D V P D Y A K Stop.

Wait, that's M followed by Y (TAC), P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), V (GTT), P (Pro?), wait.. Let me do it step by step.

First part codons:

1. ATG = M

2. TAC = Y

3. CCA = P

4. TAC = Y

5. GAT = D

6. GTT = V

7. CCA = P

8. GAT = D

9. TAC = Y

10. GCC = A

11. AAA = K

12. TGA = Stop.

Wait, so the amino acid sequence is M Y P Y D V P D Y A K Stop. Oh, there's a stop codon at the 12th codon.

But HA tag is usually YPYDVPDYA, which is 9 amino acids. So when the N-terminal tag is added, after the initial methionine (which is cleaved in some cases, but sometimes remains), the HA tag should follow. But here, starting with ATG (M), then Y P Y D V P D Y A K, then the stop. But wait, the HA tag is supposed to be YPYDVPDYA, so that would be inserting after the initial methionine? So here they've perhaps inserted the HA tag sequence right after the start codon. But the problem is that there is a premature stop codon.

Looking at the peptide sequence, the initial part would be M Y P Y D V P D Y A K Stop. So after the 11th codon, there's a AAA (K) and then TGA (stop). But where is the rest of the GADD45G protein? The problem is that the premature stop codon truncates the protein after the HA tag, so the GADD45G coding sequence isn't present. The HA tag is there, but the rest of the gene is lost.

Why is there a TGA stop codon so early? Let's check the sequence again. So after inserting the HA tag, did they accidentally introduce a stop codon? The inserted HA tag nucleotides may have inadvertently included a stop. Let's look at how the HA tag is usually encoded. The HA tag amino acids: Y P Y D V P D Y A. The last A (alanine) would be encoded by GCT, GCC, GCA, or GCG. The given sequence here, though, after the HA tag section, ends with AAA (K) followed by TGA (stop). Wait, let me confirm the exact codons for HA tag.

Wild HA tag sequence is typically like:

Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Asp Tyr Ala

Y    P  Y   D  V   P   D   Y   A

So nucleotides for each:

Tyr: TAC or TAT

Pro: CCA, CCC, CCG, CCT

Similarly, Asp: GAT or GAC, Val: GTT, GTC, GTA, GTG; Pro: CCA etc.

In the given sequence, after start codon:

Y (TAC), P (CCA), Y (TAC), D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CCA), D (GAT), Y (TAC), A (GCC), K (AAA), Stop (TGA).

Wait, that's (positions 1-3: ATG) M, then positions 4-6: TAC (Y), 7-9: CCA (P), 10-12: TAC (Y), 13-15: GAT (D), 16-18: GTT (V), 19-21: CCA (P), 22-24: GAT (D), 25-27: TAC (Y), 28-30: GCC (A) → so that would make Y P Y D V P D Y A. So that's 9 amino acids (HA tag is 9aa). Then next is 31-33: AAA (K), which is a lysine, and then 34-36: TGA (Stop).

But in the HA tag, the last A (Ala) would be GCC (as in the sequence at 28-30), then what is AAA (K)? That's not part of the HA tag. Then the TGA stop. Wait, maybe they designed the HA tag as YPYDVPDYAK, but that would be 10 amino acids, K being the 10th, and then a stop. But the intended HA tag might have a substitution or extra amino acids. However, the main issue is that there's a stop codon immediately after the HA tag.

But wait, why is there a K (AAA) followed by a stop? That must be the key. Let's check how they inserted the HA tag into the GADD45G coding sequence.

They wanted to add the HA tag to the N-terminus of GADD45G. The HA tag is typically inserted at the beginning, so the construct should be: start codon (ATG), followed by HA coding sequence (without a stop codon), followed by the GADD45G coding sequence (without its own start codon). So the full coding sequence is HA tag fused in frame to GADD45G.

But in their construct, after the HA tag part, there is AAA (K) and then a stop codon. So the rest of GADD45G would not be translated. Therefore, the construct is truncated. Therefore, when they try to overexpress the protein, only a small peptide (HA tag plus some extra aa, then stop) is produced, and the full GADD45G is not expressed. Hence, the protein isn't overexpressed as expected because the majority of the coding sequence is after the stop codon and isn't translated.

So the problem is that there's a premature stop codon introduced right after the HA tag. Therefore, the construct is only expressing the HA tag and a K, and then stops, instead of continuing into the GADD45G coding sequence.

Why is the premature stop codon there? The user may have made a cloning error. For instance, when they inserted the HA tag sequence, they may have accidentally included a missense mutation leading to a stop codon. Alternatively, there could be a frameshift. Wait, let me check the frame.

Alternatively, maybe when they inserted the HA tag, there was a frameshift leading to different amino acids and an early stop. But the given sequence here seems to be in frame because from ATG through to GA are in frame. Let's check:

From codon positions (each codon is 3 bases):

1-3: ATG (M)

4-6: TAC (Y)

7-9: CCA (P)

10-12: TAC (Y)

13-15: GAT (D)

This is frame 1 (each set of 3 is correct). So perhaps the issue isn't a frameshift. Then why is there a stop codon TGA at positions 34-36?

Possible reasons:

1. When they designed the HA tag, they accidentally included the TGA stop codon. Maybe the HA tag sequence they inserted was designed with a mistake that added the TGA. Alternatively, the HA tag sequence they used inadvertently leads to a stop codon in frame.

2. The HA tag was inserted correctly, but when inserted in the context of the GADD45G coding sequence, the ligation caused an accidental TGA in frame. This could happen, for example, if there was a cloning artifact during the insertion of the HA tag into the GADD45G coding sequence. For example, the HA tag insertion could have caused a +0 frameshift (in frame) but mistakenly retained part of the vector or a linker that introduced the TGA. Alternatively, during the cloning, when joining the HA tag to GADD45G, perhaps they added a linker sequence that includes a TGA codon. But according to the initial description, they wanted the HA tag at the N-terminus, so the HA sequence should be immediately followed by GADD45G.

Alternatively, perhaps they amplified the HA tag and GADD45G, and during the PCR/ligation process, unintended mutations or ligation points introduced a stop codon.

Looking at the nucleotide sequence, after the HA tag (positions 1-30), the 28-30 is GCC (Ala), 31-33 is AAA (Lys), 34-36 is TGA (stop). So looking at what comes after GCC (positions 28-30): AAA is next codon, then TGA.

In the HA tag sequence, where does this come from? Let me think—if the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, the last Alanine is encoded by GCC, then if the GADD45G coding sequence starts after that, the GCC would be followed by the first codon of GADD45G. But here, between the end of the HA tag (GCC) and the start of GADD45G is AAA TGA. That is, after the HA tag, if you have a lysine and a stop, then that's indicating that the actual GADD45G coding sequence isn't present there, but the inserted sequence does.

Wait, the original GADD45G gene starts with ATG, but in this construct, the ATG is part of the HA tag. Wait, but GADD45G's coding sequence would normally start with its own ATG, which was probably replaced by the HA tag's ATG (the start codon). Wait, but creating the transgene for overexpression, they probably fuse the HA tag in frame to the GADD45G ORF, such that the HA tag is at the N-terminus. That means that after the HA tag sequence (without a stop), the GADD45G ORF follows in frame. But in the presented construct, after the HA tag (as per translation) we get a stop.

Therefore, either during cloning, the HA tag was fused out of frame with the GADD45G ORF, leading to a premature stop, but in this case the stop is in frame.

Wait, the coding sequence here is continuous: the HA tag ending with GCC (Ala), then AAA (Lys), TGA (Stop). But when the construct was designed, the intention would be to have the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) followed directly by GADD45G's coding sequence. So for example, after Alanine (from the HA tag), the next codon should be the first codon of the GADD45G protein (without its own ATG, because the start is provided by the HA's ATG).

Wait, but in reality, GADD45G's natural protein starts with its own methionine. If the HA tag is added as an N-terminal tag, you would replace the original start codon of GADD45G with the HA tag. So maybe they removed the original ATG of GADD45G and inserted HA tag in its place. Then the HA tag is fused directly into the GADD45G ORF.

But in this case, the sequence after HA tag is AAA TGA, then... Wait, in the given construct's sequence, after the TGA stop, the rest of the DNA continues. So after TGA is CTC TGG AAG AAA GTC CGC GGC... etc. If the stop codon is in frame, then translation stops, and the rest of the sequence isn't translated. Thus, the protein would be truncated after K.

This would explain why they cannot overexpress the protein: the construct has an early stop codon after the HA tag. Hence, no full-length protein.

But how did the TGA get there? Well, the original HA tag insertion might have included a linker or some other sequence that inserted those codons. Alternatively, if the cloning process accidentally inserted a TGA stop codon. Let's look at inserting the HA tag. The HA tag's DNA sequence should end with the codons for its last amino acid (Ala), then followed immediatley by the start of GADD45G. If in the cloning process, there is an additional codon inserted between the HA tag and GADD45G (like AAA and then TGA), this would be problematic. But why are these codons present?

Alternatively, the HA tag was synthesized with an error. Let's check the HA tag sequence. HA tag's DNA sequence is typically:

TATCCATATGACGTTCCAGATTACGCTTAG

But split into codons:

TAT CCA TAT GAC GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC  ... but the HA is YP YDV PDY A (the HA tag is 9 aa). Wait, let's code for YPYDVPDYA.

Y (TAC or TAT)

P (CCA)

Y (TAC)

D (GAT or GAC)

V (GTT, GTC, GTA, GTG)

P (CCA)

D (GAT)

Y (TAC)

A (GCC, GCT, GCA, or GCG)

Thus, the coding sequence would be something like TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC.

In this user's construct, after ATG, the sequence is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...

Wait, so their HA tag coding sequence is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC

Then after GCC, they have AAA TGA.

Comparing this to the designed HA tag, after the last A (GCC), they have AAA TGA. If the HA tag ends with GCC (Ala), then GADD45G should follow. But perhaps, during cloning, the HA tag was inserted followed by AAA TGA, perhaps from a restriction site or a linker. For instance, the person might have used restriction enzymes that added extra nucleotides, or perhaps linker sequences between the HA tag and GADD45G included a stop codon.

Alternatively, if the forward primer for amplifying the HA tag included a KpnI site (for example), the corresponding nucleotides would add a K (AAA) and some amino acids. But in this case, K is AAA and TGA is the stop.

But here, their construct's HA tag is extended beyond the intended by a lysine and then the stop. So where did the AAA TGA come from? That's probably caused by the cloning design. For example, if they used a PCR primer to insert the HA tag that included additional nucleotides. Let me check: suppose the cloning strategy added a Kozak sequence? Or, more likely, a restriction enzyme site. Suppose they inserted a restriction site after the HA tag for cloning purposes, and the recognition site includes AAA followed by a TGA. For example, a restriction enzyme site that starts with TGA. Or perhaps they ligated a fragment containing AAA TGA.

But looking deeper: the HA tag sequence in the construct is from positions 4-30: 

TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC (positions 4-30). Then the next codons are AAA (31-33, lysine), TGA (34-36, stop), then CTC TGG etc. The HA tag should end with GCC (Ala) and then be followed directly by the next codon of GADD45G. But here, after the HA tag, they have AAA TGA. So the cloning must have introduced these extra codons. The main problem is that by having a stop codon immediately after the HA tag, the mRNA is being translated into a small peptide (HA + K) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. Therefore, when they transfer the plasmid into CHO cells, they are not getting overexpression of the full-length GADD45G-HA fusion protein, only a tiny peptide that's quickly degraded, hence no detectable protein.

Therefore, the error in the construct is the presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) right after the HA tag, leading to no expression of the GADD45G protein.

But why would the user put in AAA TGA? Probably an error in the cloning process. Maybe during the insertion of the HA tag into the plasmid, additional nucleotides were included between the HA tag and the GADD45G gene. For example, using a PCR primer that had some incorrect overhangs, or restriction enzyme sites adding in extra nucleotides.

Another possibility is that there's a mutation in the HA tag sequence that introduced a stop. Let's check the given HA codons:

Expected HA tag codons: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC (last codon for Alanine, GCC). But in the user's sequence, after GCC, it's AAA TGA. So perhaps originally, the insertion was supposed to be without these two codons. However, due to a mistake in primer design or cloning, these codons were inserted. For example, if the reverse primer for inserting the HA tag had some extra nucleotides that introduced AAA and TGA. Alternatively, vector backbone sequence carried over.

Moreover, the sequence following the TGA (positions 37 onwards) is CTCTGG... etc. So in DNA terms, CTC TGG... is in the reading frame starting from the original ATG? If they have a premature stop at TGA (positions 34-36), then the remaining sequence is not translated. Hence, the GADD45G sequence parts are after that but are not expressed.

Therefore, the correct answer is that there is a premature stop codon immediately after the HA tag sequence, which truncates the protein and prevents the expression of the full-length GADD45G-HA fusion protein. The insertion of AAA TGA (lysine followed by stop) after the HA tag prevents translation of the GADD45G.

The error likely occurred during the insertion of the HA tag, perhaps due to incorrect primer design leading to the insertion of the AAA and TGA codons after the HA tag. This explains why the protein is not overexpressed.

22-24: GAT (D)

25-27: TAC (Y)

28-30: GCC (A)

31-33: AAA (K)

34-36: TGA (Stop)

Wait, hold on. So after positions 1-33 (start codon to AAA (K) is 31033?), but then positions 34-36 are TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh, wait, start from the beginning:

Sequence: 

Positions:

1-3: ATG (M)

4-6: TAC (Y)

7-9: CCA (P)

10-12: TAC (Y)

13-15: GAT (D)

16-18: GTT (V)

19-21: CCA (P)

22-24: GAT (D)

25-27: TAC (Y)

28-30: GCC (A)

31-33: AAA (K)

34-36: TGA (stop)

Oh! That's a problem! So the HA tag is supposed to be added as the N-terminal tag, but the coding sequence includes a premature stop codon immediately after. The HA tag is generally the sequence YPYDVPDYA. Let's check that.

The HA tag nucleotide sequence is usually: TATCCGTACGATGTGCCGGACTACGCT (or some variation, but encoding YPYDVPDYA). Let’s see.

Wait, the user mentioned that they added the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant (HA tag) at the N-terminus. The HA tag's amino acid sequence is typically YP YDV PDYA. Let's see the first part of the protein.

The start codon is ATG, which is methionine. Then the HA tag should follow. The first amino acids after MET should be the HA tag. S

Regarding this case, the investigators developed a transgenic mouse model designed to display inducible overexpression of GADD45G protein with an N-terminal HA tag. After creating the plasmid and transfecting CHO cells, they isolated antibiotic-resistant colonies but discovered that the protein wasn't being overexpressed as anticipated. They've now examined the plus strand sequence of their construct to identify the issue.

The plus strand sequence provided is: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'.

To analyze the problem, I need to translate this DNA sequence to examine the protein structure. I'm checking for issues like premature stop codons or frameshifts. Since this construct should contain an HA tag (the peptide sequence YPYDVPDYA) at the N-terminus followed by GADD45G, I'll begin by translating from the start codon ATG.

Breaking down the sequence codon by codon:
Positions 1-3: ATG (Methionine, M)
Positions 4-6: TAC (Tyrosine, Y)
Positions 7-9: CCA (Proline, P)
Positions 10-12: TAC (Tyrosine, Y)
Positions 13-15: GAT (Aspartic acid, D)
Positions 16-18: GTT (Valine, V)
Positions 19-21: CCA (Proline, P)
Positions 22-24: GAT (Aspartic acid, D)
Positions 25-27: TAC (Tyrosine, Y)
Positions 28-30: GCC (Alanine, A)
Positions 31-33: AAA (Lysine, K)
Positions 34-36: TGA (Stop codon)

I've identified the critical issue: there's a premature stop codon (TGA) at positions 34-36, immediately following the HA tag sequence. This means the protein translation terminates right after the HA tag, preventing expression of the GADD45G protein. The HA tag sequence appears correct (YPYDVPDYA), but the premature termination explains why no functional protein overexpression was observed.

Alright, here's the rephrased text:

The issue at hand is that there was an attempt to generate a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with an HA marker at the N-terminus. After cloning the plasmid and transfecting CHO cells, they isolated antibiotic-resistant colonies but did not observe the anticipated protein overexpression. They then examined the plus strand sequence of their construct to identify the problem.

The plus strand provided is 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'.

The first step is to translate the DNA sequence to understand the appearance of the resulting protein, suspecting possible premature stop codons or frameshifts. Since this sequence encodes GADD45G with an HA tag (a small peptide tag, usually around nine amino acids: YPYDVPDYA, from the HA epitope), the N-terminus is expected to contain this sequence. Let's initiate translation of the provided DNA.

The plus strand runs 5' to 3', so the mRNA sequence would mirror this, with thymine (T) replaced by uracil (U). Thus, I will transcribe the DNA to mRNA and proceed to translation. The start codon here is ATG, representing methionine.

I'll begin translation of the DNA sequence at the ATG start site.

Breaking it down, the sequence appears as:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGG AAA GCG CTG CAT GAG TTG CTG CTG TCG GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC CTC ACT GCC GGC GTC TAC GAG TCA GCC AAA GTC TTG AAC GTG GAC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC TGT GTG CTG GCT GCG GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TTC TGC TGC GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CCG GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC AAC GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCC TTG GAG AAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGC AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA

Translating this gives:

Start with ATG (M), then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (Stop).

Oh, this occurs very early. Let's confirm: the sequence initiates with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...

Then:

1-3: ATG gives M

4-6: TAC gives Y

7-9: CCA gives P

10-12: TAC gives Y 

Wait—in the DNA sequence above, it reads "C" when aligned 5' to 3'.

Let me reassess:

Original DNA sequence: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

First few codons parsed as:

From the first ATG (positions 1-3)

4-6: TAC (Y)

7-9: CCA (P)

10-12: TAC (Y)

There's a premature stop, as following ATG:

1-3: ATG (M)

4-6: TAC (Y)

7-9: CCA (P)

10-12: TAC (Y)

13-15: GAT (D)

16-18: GTT (V)

19-21: CCA (P)

22-24: GAT (D)

25-27: TAC (Y)

28-30: GCC (A)

31-33: AAA (K)

34-36: TGA (Stop)

This presents an issue—immediately after the HA tag, a stop codon occurs. The HA tag should be the N-terminal addition. Normally, the HA tag nucleotide sequence is: TATCCGTACGATGTGCCGGACTACGCT, corresponding to YPYDVPDYA. So let’s confirm.

The individual mentioned inserting a sequence for an HA tag at the N-terminus. The HA tag’s amino acid sequence is typically YPYDVPDYA, directly after methionine.

The HA tag is usually 9 amino acids: YPYDVPDYA. So MET followed by Y P Y D V P D Y A.\n\nLooking at the nucleotides:\n\nATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...\n\nTranslating each codon:\n\nATG M\n\nTAC Y\n\nCCA P\n\nTAC Y\n\nGAT D\n\nGTT V\n\nCCA P\n\nGAT D\n\nTAC Y\n\nGCC A\n\nAAA K\n\nTGA STOP\n\nWait, so the HA tag would be M followed by Y P Y D V P D Y A K, but K is not part of the HA tag. The HA tag should end at the A (YPYDVPDYA). Wait, but in the sequence here, after Y (TAC), we have D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CCA), D (GAT), Y (TAC), A (GCC), K (AAA), then STOP (TGA). So that would be the translation as MY P Y D V P D Y A K stop. But the HA tag is YP YD V PDY A. Wait, the actual HA tag is usually this sequence: Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Asp Tyr Ala. Let me check.\n\nThe HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA. The amino acid sequence is:\n\nY P Y D V P D Y A. So the DNA coding for that would be TAC CCA TAT GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT. \n\nBut in the given sequence, the coding after the start codon is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... So comparing:\n\nIntended HA tag codons (TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT), but the user\'s construct has TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA.\n\nNotice that after D (GAT), TAC (Y), then GCC would be A, but in the HA tag, the last residue is A (Ala) which is GCT or GCC. Then after that, maybe a linker or the rest of the GADD45G. But in the given sequence, after GCC (A), there is AAA (Lys) and then TGA (stop). This is an issue. So the HA tag ends with A (GCC), then K (AAA), then STOP. That would truncate the protein right after the HA tag plus a lysine. But the HA tag is only supposed to be the tag, followed by the GADD45G. So in this case, there is a premature stop codon.\n\nTherefore, the user probably accidentally introduced a premature stop codon right after the HA tag. Wait, but why is there a stop codon so early? If they cloned the HA tag followed by GADD45G, then the coding sequence should continue after the HA tag into GADD45G. However, they have a TGA (stop codon) immediately after. Therefore, their construct is missing the actual GADD45G coding sequence, replaced by a stop codon. Alternatively, maybe the cloning of HA tag introduced a frame shift leading to early termination.\n\nWait, let\'s check the sequence step by step.\n\nThe HA tag part:\n\nATG (M)\n\nThen HA tag starts with the next amino acids: Y P Y D V P D Y A\n\nSo codons should be:\n\nATG (M)\n\nTAC (Y)\n\nCCA (P)\n\nTAC (Y)\n\nGAT (D)\n\nGTT (V)\n\nCCA (P)\n\nGAT (D)\n\nTAC (Y)\n\nGCT (A)\n\nThen followed by GCC (A)\n\nWait, in their actual sequence, after the HA tag YPYDVPDY, the next codon is GCC. Wait, HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, where the last A is from GCC? Then after that, the GADD45G would follow. However, their sequence after GCT (A) would not have the stop codon. Wait, but in their sequence, after GCC (which is Ala), then AAA (Lys) and TGA (stop).\n\nWait, wait maybe they inserted an extra base or there\'s a frameshift causing premature stop. Alternatively, the cloning may have an error where instead of inserting correctly, there\'s a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the HA tag is in frame, but there\'s a stop codon right after. If their construct is cloned as HA tag followed by GADD45G, but with an early stop, then expression would result in a short peptide containing HA tag followed by some residues and a stop.\n\nWait, perhaps in their construct, after inserting the HA tag, they didn\'t properly ligate the GADD45G, or there is an error. However, the user mentioned that they introduced the sequence for the HA tag at the N-terminus, i.e., inserted in frame with GADD45G.\n\nWait, it\'s more likely that when they added the HA tag, they either didn\'t remove a stop codon that was present, or the insertion caused a frameshift leading to an in-frame stop codon.\n\nBut looking at the sequence from the user:\n\nRight after the HA tag, which should be followed by the start of the GADD45G coding sequence, but in their construct after the HA tag there\'s AAA TGA. Let me check.\n\nSo suppose the HA tag is supposed to be eight amino acids (including the initial M?), no. HA tag is M followed by YPYDVPDYA, but here the ATG (M) is followed by Y P Y D V P D Y A K STOP.\n\nWait, HA tag is typically a 9-amino-acid tag: YPYDVPDYA. So it\'s the start codon (M) followed by the tag? Or is the M part of the tag? No, M is the initiator methionine, then the HA tag. So after M, the HA is YPYDVPDYA, then the rest of the GADD45G sequence.\n\nIn the given DNA sequence, after ATG (M), the next codons are Y, P, Y, D, V, P, D, Y, A. So YPYDVPDYA: 9 amino acids. Then next codon is K (AAA), then STOP (TGA). Therefore, the coding sequence here is M-HA tag-K-stop. The entire GADD45G coding sequence is missing. So what\'s happening here?\n\nBut they intended to make a construct where the HA tag is at the N-terminus of GADD45G. Therefore, the HA tag should be followed by the entire coding sequence of GADD45G. However, in their cloned plasmid, the HA tag is followed by a lysine and a stop codon. Therefore, the rest of the gene is missing. Thus, when they try to express the protein, they only get the HA tag fused to a K and then it stops, truncating the protein. Therefore, the GADD45G coding sequence is not present after the HA tag, leading to no overexpression of the full-length protein.\n\nBut why is that? The user said they introduced the HA tag sequence into the coding sequence. Maybe during cloning, a mistake was made. For example, they may have used a primer that introduced the HA tag sequence but accidentally included the stop codon afterwards. Alternatively, there might have been a PCR error where the reverse primer introduced a stop codon. Alternatively, a vector\'s multiple cloning site had a stop codon or they inserted into the wrong site.\n\nWait, but looking at the sequence provided, from ATG onwards, there\'s the HA tag, then lysine and then stop. That suggests that the coding sequence is incomplete. So maybe instead of cloning the full-length GADD45G after the HA tag, they only included part of the sequence. However, given that they cloned the plasmid and modified the gene\'s coding sequence by inserting the HA tag at the N-terminus, perhaps the GADD45G CDS was not properly ligated after the HA tag. Alternatively, there\'s a cloning artifact where a stop codon was introduced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence for the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, leading to an immediate stop codon. Wait, let\'s check if that\'s the case. The first part from ATG, the HA tag, which is:\n\nATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... \n\nWait, let\'s count the nucleotides in that HA segment. Each codon is 3 nucleotides.\n\nSo after ATG, HA tag should be 9 codons (YPYDVPDYA). Let me count:\n\nATG (1), then:\n\nTAC (Y, 2), CCA (P, 3), TAC (Y,4), GAT (D,5), GTT (V,6), CCA (P,7), GAT (D,8), TAC (Y,9), GCC (A,10), then comes AAA (K,11), TGA (Stop, 12). \n\nSo the HA tag would be codons 2 to 10 (amino acids 2-10), making a 9-aa HA tag. But according to this, the HA tag is properly encoded as YPYDVPDYA. Then the next codon is AAA (K), and then a stop. Therefore, the construct only encodes the HA tag plus a lysine and then stops, not including any of the GADD45G sequence. Therefore, the cloning must have failed to include the actual GADD45G coding sequence after the HA tag. But how?\n\nThe user said they modified the gene\'s coding sequence by introducing the HA tag sequence. So they should have inserted the HA tag in frame at the beginning of the GADD45G coding sequence, replacing the original start codon or adding it as a tag after the start. However, if they designed their construct such that the HA tag is immediately after the ATG, and then the rest of the GADD45G is present. But in their construct, after the HA tag and a lysine, there is a stop codon. Therefore, perhaps during cloning, only part of the GADD45G was amplified or there was a mistake in the plasmid construction, so that the insert is missing GADD45G coding sequence and instead has this AAA TGA which truncates the protein.\n\nAlternatively, when they PCR amplified the GADD45G coding sequence, they might have had a mutation that introduced a premature stop codon, but given that it\'s a TGA (stop) right after the HA tag, maybe there\'s a mistake when they ligated the HA tag to the GADD45G. For example, in the process of inserting the HA tag before GADD45G, they caused a frameshift that resulted in a stop codon.\n\nWait, perhaps if the HA tag was inserted in a different frame. Let me check. Suppose that the HA tag insertion accidentally added a few extra nucleotides, shifting the reading frame. Let\'s see. \n\nOriginal (supposed) HA tag:\n\nATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC ... (and then continues with GADD45G)\n\nBut after inserting, if they inserted in a way that they added a nucleotide, creating a frameshift. Wait, but the HA tag here appears to be correctly added in frame. Because after the HA tag, the sequence is:\n\nGCC AAA TGA...\n\nSo GCC is alanine (if in frame), then AAA (lysine), TGA (stop). \n\nIf HA tag is properly in frame, then adding the next codon from GADD45G should be in the same frame as the HA tag. But in this construct, after the HA tag (which is 9 codons after the ATG, i.e., 10 codons total including ATG), there\'s the GCC (A) which is part of the HA tag (the ninth amino acid, as in YPYDVPDYA). Then after GCC (Ala) comes AAA (Lys) which is 11th codon, which would be from GADD45G, but then immediately TGA (stop). \n\nSo this TGA is the 12th codon. However, if the original GADD45G coding sequence doesn\'t have a stop codon there, then it suggests that this stop was introduced during cloning. So maybe the user accidentally ligated the HA tag to a fragment that starts with AAA TGA because of a PCR error, or mistakenly used a primer that included the stop codon. Alternatively, when doing the cloning, they might have cut the vector and insert with restriction enzymes that resulted in a frameshift. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they designed the construct with the HA tag followed by a linker that wasn\'t supposed to have a stop codon, but the restriction site introduced one. For example, if they used a restriction site in the HA tag that adds nucleotides leading to a frameshift. Alternatively, maybe their vector has a stop codon in the multiple cloning site that wasn\'t removed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe their primers when amplifying GADD45G included a mutation that introduced a stop codon. But how? If the TGA is a stop, that\'s from the DNA sequence. Looking at the given sequence, the "AAA TGA" is between the HA tag and what should be the start of GADD45G. But if GADD45G starts at that position, then in the original GADD45G sequence, the codon there would correspond to a normal amino acid. So the presence of TGA (stop codon) is incorrect and introduced during cloning.\n\nBut why would "AAA TGA" be there? Let me check the amino acid sequence. If we look up the actual GADD45G coding sequence, perhaps after the initiation codon, the second codon is Y or something else. But if they inserted the HA tag, then the codons after should be in frame.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe when adding the HA tag, they didn\'t remove the original start codon of GADD45G. So if they added the HA tag upstream of the original ATG, perhaps in frame, then you\'ll have the HA tag followed by the original ATG and the rest of GADD45G. But in this case, there\'s an ATG for HA, then TAG after HA, but the given sequence doesn\'t show that. Alternatively, they designed a fusion where the HA is before GADD45G. But the HA is supposed to be at the N-terminus.\n\nAlternatively, they attempted to clone the HA tag as a 5\' fusion to GADD45G but used the wrong primers, leading to this truncation.\n\nBut based on the sequence provided by the user, they have a premature stop codon immediately after the HA tag. That would result in the construct being unable to express the full-length GADD45G protein; instead, it produces a short peptide consisting of the HA tag plus a lysine. Since the transgenic mice would not express the full protein, affinity purification would not work. This explains why they observe no overexpression. \n\nThe mistake likely occurred during the cloning process when designing or inserting the HA tag. The construct includes a stop codon after the HA tag, truncating the protein. \n\nTo fix this, they need to ensure that the HA tag is inserted in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence and that there is no intervening stop codon between the HA tag and GADD45G. They should check their cloning strategy, verify the correct sequence of the insert, and confirm that the ligation or overlap extension PCR did not introduce any unintended mutations leading to premature termination.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743815285, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3970, prompt_tokens=2220, total_tokens=6190, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

The inability to overexpress the recombinant GADD45G protein stems from a **premature stop codon** introduced immediately after the HA tag sequence in your construct. This truncates the protein before the GADD45G coding sequence can be translated, resulting in a non-functional peptide. Here's the detailed breakdown:

---

### **Key Issue: Premature Stop Codon**
1. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - The plus strand of your construct starts with the HA tag coding sequence (designed for the epitope **YPYDVPDYA**), followed by **AAA TGA**.
   - **AAA** encodes lysine (K), and **TGA** is a stop codon. This means translation terminates immediately after the HA tag, yielding a truncated peptide: **M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K-⚠️STOP⚠️**.
   - The full GADD45G coding sequence is absent downstream, preventing overexpression of the intact protein.

2. **Root Cause**:
   - During cloning, either:
     - The HA tag was accidentally fused out-of-frame with GADD45G, introducing the premature stop (unlikely here since the HA tag itself is in frame).
     - **OR**
     - A cloning artifact (e.g., primer error, ligation mistake, or mutation) added the **AAA TGA** sequence after the HA tag, replacing the intended GADD45G coding sequence.

---

### **Solution**
1. **Revisit Cloning Strategy**:
   - Verify the junction between the HA tag and GADD45G in your plasmid design. The HA tag should be directly followed by the GADD45G sequence **without intervening stop codons**.
   - Confirm that restriction sites or overlap regions in primers did not inadvertently introduce **TGA** (e.g., ensure compatible cohesive ends or correct primer annealing during Gibson assembly).

2. **Correct the Sequence**:
   - Remove the **AAA TGA** nucleotides following the HA tag to restore the in-frame linkage to GADD45G.
   - Example of corrected junction:
     ```
     ...TAC GCC [GADD45Gcoding sequence starts here]...
     ```
   - The HA tag should transition seamlessly into the GADD45G sequence (e.g., ending with **GCC** for the HA tag’s alanine, then proceeding with the first codon of GADD45G).

3. **Validate the Construct**:
   - Sequence the entire plasmid to confirm proper in-frame fusion.
   - Test expression in CHO cells again after correction.

---

### **Why This Matters**
- A premature stop codon halts translation, so the recombinant protein is never synthesized. Without full-length GADD45G, you cannot study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection or purify it for interaction studies.
- The HA tag must be fused *in frame* and followed by the complete GADD45G coding sequence to ensure proper overexpression.

By addressing the truncation, you should achieve the desired overexpression and proceed with your experiment. 🧬🔧

So in the given DNA, after ATG (M), the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), then TGA (stop).

Wait, let's do this step by step.

The N-terminal HA tag in this case is added as a tag. The HA tag is usually 9 amino acids: YPYDVPDYA. So MET followed by Y P Y D V P D Y A.

Looking at the nucleotides:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...

Translating each codon:

ATG M

TAC Y

CCA P

TAC Y

GAT D

GTT V

CCA P

GAT D

TAC Y

GCC A

AAA K

TGA STOP

Wait, so the HA tag would be M followed by Y P Y D V P D Y A K, but K is not part of the HA tag. The HA tag should end at the A (YPYDVPDYA). Wait, but in the sequence here, after Y (TAC), we have D (GAT), V (GTT), P (CCA), D (GAT), Y (TAC), A (GCC), K (AAA), then STOP (TGA). So that would be the translation as MY P Y D V P D Y A K stop. But the HA tag is YP YD V PDY A. Wait, the actual HA tag is usually this sequence: Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Asp Tyr Ala. Let me check.

The HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA. The amino acid sequence is:

Y P Y D V P D Y A. So the DNA coding for that would be TAC CCA TAT GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT. 

But in the given sequence, the coding after the start codon is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... So comparing:

Intended HA tag codons (TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT), but the user's construct has TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA.

Notice that after D (GAT), TAC (Y), then GCC would be A, but in the HA tag, the last residue is A (Ala) which is GCT or GCC. Then after that, maybe a linker or the rest of the GADD45G. But in the given sequence, after GCC (A), there is AAA (Lys) and then TGA (stop). This is an issue. So the HA tag ends with A (GCC), then K (AAA), then STOP. That would truncate the protein right after the HA tag plus a lysine. But the HA tag is only supposed to be the tag, followed by the GADD45G. So in this case, there is a premature stop codon.

Therefore, the user probably accidentally introduced a premature stop codon right after the HA tag. Wait, but why is there a stop codon so early? If they cloned the HA tag followed by GADD45G, then the coding sequence should continue after the HA tag into GADD45G. However, they have a TGA (stop codon) immediately after. Therefore, their construct is missing the actual GADD45G coding sequence, replaced by a stop codon. Alternatively, maybe the cloning of HA tag introduced a frame shift leading to early termination.

Wait, let's check the sequence step by step.

The HA tag part:

ATG (M)

Then HA tag starts with the next amino acids: Y P Y D V P D Y A

So codons should be:

ATG (M)

TAC (Y)

CCA (P)

TAC (Y)

GAT (D)

GTT (V)

CCA (P)

GAT (D)

TAC (Y)

GCT (A)

Then followed by GCC (A)

Wait, in their actual sequence, after the HA tag YPYDVPDY, the next codon is GCC. Wait, HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, where the last A is from GCC? Then after that, the GADD45G would follow. However, their sequence after GCT (A) would not have the stop codon. Wait, but in their sequence, after GCC (which is Ala), then AAA (Lys) and TGA (stop).

Wait, wait maybe they inserted an extra base or there's a frameshift causing premature stop. Alternatively, the cloning may have an error where instead of inserting correctly, there's a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is in frame, but there's a stop codon right after. If their construct is cloned as HA tag followed by GADD45G, but with an early stop, then expression would result in a short peptide containing HA tag followed by some residues and a stop.

Wait, perhaps in their construct, after inserting the HA tag, they didn't properly ligate the GADD45G, or there is an error. However, the user mentioned that they introduced the sequence for the HA tag at the N-terminus, i.e., inserted in frame with GADD45G.

Wait, it's more likely that when they added the HA tag, they either didn't remove a stop codon that was present, or the insertion caused a frameshift leading to an in-frame stop codon.

But looking at the sequence from the user:

Right after the HA tag, which should be followed by the start of the GADD45G coding sequence, but in their construct after the HA tag there's AAA TGA. Let me check.

So suppose the HA tag is supposed to be eight amino acids (including the initial M?), no. HA tag is M followed by YPYDVPDYA, but here the ATG (M) is followed by Y P Y D V P D Y A K STOP.

Wait, HA tag is typically a 9-amino-acid tag: YPYDVPDYA. So it's the start codon (M) followed by the tag? Or is the M part of the tag? No, M is the initiator methionine, then the HA tag. So after M, the HA is YPYDVPDYA, then the rest of the GADD45G sequence.

In the given DNA sequence, after ATG (M), the next codons are Y, P, Y, D, V, P, D, Y, A. So YPYDVPDYA: 9 amino acids. Then next codon is K (AAA), then STOP (TGA). Therefore, the coding sequence here is M-HA tag-K-stop. The entire GADD45G coding sequence is missing. So what's happening here?

But they intended to make a construct where the HA tag is at the N-terminus of GADD45G. Therefore, the HA tag should be followed by the entire coding sequence of GADD45G. However, in their cloned plasmid, the HA tag is followed by a lysine and a stop codon. Therefore, the rest of the gene is missing. Thus, when they try to express the protein, they only get the HA tag fused to a K and then it stops, truncating the protein. Therefore, the GADD45G coding sequence is not present after the HA tag, leading to no overexpression of the full-length protein.

But why is that? The user said they introduced the HA tag sequence into the coding sequence. Maybe during cloning, a mistake was made. For example, they may have used a primer that introduced the HA tag sequence but accidentally included the stop codon afterwards. Alternatively, there might have been a PCR error where the reverse primer introduced a stop codon. Alternatively, a vector's multiple cloning site had a stop codon or they inserted into the wrong site.

Wait, but looking at the sequence provided, from ATG onwards, there's the HA tag, then lysine and then stop. That suggests that the coding sequence is incomplete. So maybe instead of cloning the full-length GADD45G after the HA tag, they only included part of the sequence. However, given that they cloned the plasmid and modified the gene's coding sequence by inserting the HA tag at the N-terminus, perhaps the GADD45G CDS was not properly ligated after the HA tag. Alternatively, there's a cloning artifact where a stop codon was introduced.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence for the HA tag was inserted in the wrong reading frame, leading to an immediate stop codon. Wait, let's check if that's the case. The first part from ATG, the HA tag, which is:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... 

Wait, let's count the nucleotides in that HA segment. Each codon is 3 nucleotides.

So after ATG, HA tag should be 9 codons (YPYDVPDYA). Let me count:

ATG (1), then:

TAC (Y, 2), CCA (P, 3), TAC (Y,4), GAT (D,5), GTT (V,6), CCA (P,7), GAT (D,8), TAC (Y,9), GCC (A,10), then comes AAA (K,11), TGA (Stop, 12). 

So the HA tag would be codons 2 to 10 (amino acids 2-10), making a 9-aa HA tag. But according to this, the HA tag is properly encoded as YPYDVPDYA. Then the next codon is AAA (K), and then a stop. Therefore, the construct only encodes the HA tag plus a lysine and then stops, not including any of the GADD45G sequence. Therefore, the cloning must have failed to include the actual GADD45G coding sequence after the HA tag. But how?

The user said they modified the gene's coding sequence by introducing the HA tag sequence. So they should have inserted the HA tag in frame at the beginning of the GADD45G coding sequence, replacing the original start codon or adding it as a tag after the start. However, if they designed their construct such that the HA tag is immediately after the ATG, and then the rest of the GADD45G is present. But in their construct, after the HA tag and a lysine, there is a stop codon. Therefore, perhaps during cloning, only part of the GADD45G was amplified or there was a mistake in the plasmid construction, so that the insert is missing GADD45G coding sequence and instead has this AAA TGA which truncates the protein.

Alternatively, when they PCR amplified the GADD45G coding sequence, they might have had a mutation that introduced a premature stop codon, but given that it's a TGA (stop) right after the HA tag, maybe there's a mistake when they ligated the HA tag to the GADD45G. For example, in the process of inserting the HA tag before GADD45G, they caused a frameshift that resulted in a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps if the HA tag was inserted in a different frame. Let me check. Suppose that the HA tag insertion accidentally added a few extra nucleotides, shifting the reading frame. Let's see. 

Original (supposed) HA tag:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC ... (and then continues with GADD45G)

But after inserting, if they inserted in a way that they added a nucleotide, creating a frameshift. Wait, but the HA tag here appears to be correctly added in frame. Because after the HA tag, the sequence is:

GCC AAA TGA...

So GCC is alanine (if in frame), then AAA (lysine), TGA (stop). 

If HA tag is properly in frame, then adding the next codon from GADD45G should be in the same frame as the HA tag. But in this construct, after the HA tag (which is 9 codons after the ATG, i.e., 10 codons total including ATG), there's the GCC (A) which is part of the HA tag (the ninth amino acid, as in YPYDVPDYA). Then after GCC (Ala) comes AAA (Lys) which is 11th codon, which would be from GADD45G, but then immediately TGA (stop). 

So this TGA is the 12th codon. However, if the original GADD45G coding sequence doesn't have a stop codon there, then it suggests that this stop was introduced during cloning. So maybe the user accidentally ligated the HA tag to a fragment that starts with AAA TGA because of a PCR error, or mistakenly used a primer that included the stop codon. Alternatively, when doing the cloning, they might have cut the vector and insert with restriction enzymes that resulted in a frameshift. 

Alternatively, maybe they designed the construct with the HA tag followed by a linker that wasn't supposed to have a stop codon, but the restriction site introduced one. For example, if they used a restriction site in the HA tag that adds nucleotides leading to a frameshift. Alternatively, maybe their vector has a stop codon in the multiple cloning site that wasn't removed. 

Alternatively, maybe their primers when amplifying GADD45G included a mutation that introduced a stop codon. But how? If the TGA is a stop, that's from the DNA sequence. Looking at the given sequence, the "AAA TGA" is between the HA tag and what should be the start of GADD45G. But if GADD45G starts at that position, then in the original GADD45G sequence, the codon there would correspond to a normal amino acid. So the presence of TGA (stop codon) is incorrect and introduced during cloning.

But why would "AAA TGA" be there? Let me check the amino acid sequence. If we look up the actual GADD45G coding sequence, perhaps after the initiation codon, the second codon is Y or something else. But if they inserted the HA tag, then the codons after should be in frame.

Another possibility: maybe when adding the HA tag, they didn't remove the original start codon of GADD45G. So if they added the HA tag upstream of the original ATG, perhaps in frame, then you'll have the HA tag followed by the original ATG and the rest of GADD45G. But in this case, there's an ATG for HA, then TAG after HA, but the given sequence doesn't show that. Alternatively, they designed a fusion where the HA is before GADD45G. But the HA is supposed to be at the N-terminus.

Alternatively, they attempted to clone the HA tag as a 5' fusion to GADD45G but used the wrong primers, leading to this truncation.

But based on the sequence provided by the user, they have a premature stop codon immediately after the HA tag. That would result in the construct being unable to express the full-length GADD45G protein; instead, it produces a short peptide consisting of the HA tag plus a lysine. Since the transgenic mice would not express the full protein, affinity purification would not work. This explains why they observe no overexpression. 

The mistake likely occurred during the cloning process when designing or inserting the HA tag. The construct includes a stop codon after the HA tag, truncating the protein. 

To fix this, they need to ensure that the HA tag is inserted in frame with the GADD45G coding sequence and that there is no intervening stop codon between the HA tag and GADD45G. They should check their cloning strategy, verify the correct sequence of the insert, and confirm that the ligation or overlap extension PCR did not introduce any unintended mutations leading to premature termination.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The **premature stop codon** introduced after the HA tag sequence is the key issue preventing overexpression of the GADD45G protein. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

---

### 1. **HA Tag Design and Expected Protein Translation**
   - The HA tag sequence should encode **YPYDVPDYA**.
   - Translating the first 30 nucleotides (underlined in the provided sequence) gives:
     ```
     ATG (M) → M
     TAC (Y) → Y
     CCA (P) → P
     TAC (Y) → Y
     GAT (D) → D
     GTT (V) → V
     CCA (P) → P
     GAT (D) → D
     TAC (Y) → Y
     GCC (A) → A
     AAA (K) → K
     ```
     **Result:** **MYPYDVPDYA** (HA tag + K, followed by a stop codon).

---

### 2. **Premature Termination of Translation**
   - Immediately after the HA tag, at positions **34–36** of the sequence: **TGA** (stop codon).
     ```
     AAA (K) → Ax** 
     **TGA** (Stop) → Translation halts here.
     ```
   - This truncates the protein immediately after the HA tag, leaving the GADD45G sequence untranslated.

---

### 3. **Root Cause**
   - The HA tag is followed by **AAA** (Lys, K) and then **TGA** (stop codon). This suggests a cloning error:
     - The original HA tag sequence (YPYDVPDYA) should end with **TAC** (Y) **GCC** (A) **T**... but an extra base insertion, deletion, or mutation likely introduced **TGA** instead of a codon for the next amino acid (e.g., **GCC** or **GCT** for Alanine in GADD45G’s native sequence).

---

### 4. **Why This Happened**
   - **Primer Design Error**: If PCR primers were used to add the HA tag, a mismatch might have introduced unintended bases (e.g., converting native **GCC** to **TGA**).
   - **Cloning Artifact**: Restriction enzyme ligation or synthesis errors during plasmid construction could have disrupted the coding sequence.

---

### 5. **Solution**
   - **Correct the Coding Sequence**: Remove the premature stop codon by mutating **TGA** to the appropriate codon for the next amino acid (likely **GCC/GCT** for Alanine if the native GADD45G sequence continues here).
   - **Verify Plasmid**: Sequence the full construct to ensure no unintended mutations exist beyond the HA tag.

---

**Final Answer:**  
The premature stop codon (**TGA**) immediately after the HA tag sequence terminates translation, preventing expression of the full-length GADD45G protein. Correcting this codon to match the native GADD45G sequence will restore proper protein production.

 The error likely arose from a cloning mistake where an unwanted stop codon was introduced either through PCR error or incorrect primer design during the HA tag insertion.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

The failure to overexpress the GADD45G-HA fusion protein stems from a **premature stop codon** early in the coding sequence of the construct. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Key Issue: Premature Stop Codon in the Sequence**
1. **Sequence Analysis**:
   - The N-terminal HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) is encoded by:  
     **ATG (M)** → TAC (Y) → CCA (P) → TAC (Y) → GAT (D) → GTT (V) → CCA (P) → GAT (D) → TAC (Y) → GCC (A) → **AAA (K)** → **TGA (Stop)**.  
     - This results in a truncated peptide: **M-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K-⭐️Stop⭐️**.

2. **Implications**:
   - The stop codon (**TGA**) at positions 34–36 terminates translation immediately after the HA tag, preventing the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein.
   - This explains why only a short peptide (≈11 amino acids) is produced, evading detection in expression assays.

---

### **Root Cause**
The **TGA codon** was likely introduced via a cloning error when designing the HA tag:
- **Possible errors**:
  - Accidental insertion of an extra nucleotide during primer design or PCR.
  - Incorrect ligation of the HA tag sequence into the GADD45G coding sequence.
  - Silent mutations/artifacts during subcloning (e.g., improper codon optimization).

---

### **Solution**
1. **Correct the HA Tag Sequence**:
   - Ensure the HA tag sequence (**TACCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTAC**, encoding YPYDVPDYA*) is inserted *in-frame* without introducing premature stops.
   - Verify that the junction between the HA tag and GADD45G coding sequence maintains the correct reading frame.

2. **Sequence Validation**:
   - Resequence the construct to confirm the absence of unintended mutations.
   - Use codon optimization tools to avoid introducing problematic sequences (e.g., cryptic splice sites, restriction sites, or stop codons).

---

**Conclusion**: The prematurely truncated protein due to the TGA stop codon explains the lack of detectable overexpression. Correcting the HA tag sequence will resolve the issue and allow proper expression of the full-length GADD45G-HA fusion protein.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Let's check how they have designed the construct.

The first part of the coding sequence starts with ATG (Met), followed by TAC, which is Y, then proline (CCA), TAC-Y, GAT-D, GTT-V, CCA-P, GAT-D, TAC-Y, GCC-A, AAA-K, then a stop codon (TGA). So from this translation:

The HA tag is present but likely because the AAA (K) is inserted at position 31-33, coding for lysine after Alanine (GCC) at positions 28-30. But then TGA (positions 34-36) is a stop codon. This implies that the coding sequence is truncated right after starting to express the HA tag and the beginning of GADD45G. Thus, when transfected into cells, the expressed protein would be a very short peptide: Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K-Stop. Only the HA tag and part of the flanking sequence, leading to a truncated protein (if the stop is recognized), preventing the production of the full-length GADD45G-HA fusion.

The key error here is an in-frame stop codon introduced shortly after the start, immediately truncating the expressed protein. Therefore, even though the vector, selection, and other elements are correct, the presence of the premature stop codon would prevent overexpression of the full-length protein, leading to non-observable bands in Western blot or other detection methods.

Possible cause: The HA tag might have been designed improperly during the cloning process, leading to insertion of nucleotides that introduced a premature stop codon. Alternatively, a sequencing error or a cloning artifact (e.g., incorrect ligation, PCR error during construct assembly) could have inserted the TGA stop codon at that position. Specifically, the AAA (Lys) followed by TGA creates this premature stop.

Therefore, the construct's design inadvertently introduced an early stop codon, terminating translation prematurely and preventing the overexpression of the GADD45G protein.
