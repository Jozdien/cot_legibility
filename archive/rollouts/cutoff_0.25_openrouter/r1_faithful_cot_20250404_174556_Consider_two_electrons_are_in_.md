# Original Question

Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$?

To determine the joint probability of both electrons having eigenvalues of \(-\hbar\) for their \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) measurements when the combined state is \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\), we need to consider the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the coupled state.

The state \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\) is a total angular momentum state with \(l = 2\) and \(m = -1\). This state is formed by combining two individual \(l = 1\) states. The key point is that the total \(m\) value (\(m = -1\)) must be the sum of the individual \(m\) values (\(m_1\) and \(m_2\)) of the two electrons.

For the total \(m = -1\), the possible combinations of \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are:
- \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = 0\)
- \(m_1 = 0\) and \(m_2 = -1\)

The combination \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = -1\) would result in a total \(m = -2\), which corresponds to the state \(|1, 1, 2, -2\rangle\), not \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\). Therefore, the state \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\) does not contain any component where both \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are \(-1\).

Thus, the joint probability of measuring both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\) is zero.

\[
\boxed{0}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the joint probability of both electrons having an eigenvalue of -ħ for their Lz components when the combined state is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, let me think about how angular momentum coupling works here.

First, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled state, which means it's a combination of the individual states of each electron's angular momentum. Since we're dealing with two p orbitals, each has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The total angular momentum here is l = 2 and m = -1. So, this state is part of the triplet (or quintet?) of states with total angular momentum 2. But wait, when you combine two l=1 states, the possible total angular momenta are l = 2, 1, 0. So l=2 is the highest, then 1, then 0. Since the given state is |1,1,2,-1>, that's a state with total l=2 and m=-1.

Now, the problem is asking for the joint probability of measuring L1z and L2z both as -ħ. That is, what's the probability that when we measure the z-component of each electron's orbital angular momentum, both are -ħ. Since the eigenvalues of Lz for l=1 are m=-1, 0, +1 times ħ, so the possible outcomes for each are -ħ, 0, +ħ for each electron.

To find the joint probability, I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled basis states |l1, m1> |l2, m2>. Then, find the coefficient for the term where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, and take the square of the absolute value of that coefficient.

So the key here is to use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l=2, m=-1> in the coupled basis can be written as a linear combination of the uncoupled states where m1 + m2 = -1. Because in the coupled basis, m = m1 + m2. Since we're looking for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, that sum would be -2, which doesn't match the total m=-1. So, actually, would there be a component where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 in the |2,-1> state? Wait, no. Because m1 + m2 is -1 for the total state. So if m1 = -1, then m2 must satisfy m1 + m2 = -1 => -1 + m2 = -1 => m2=0. Similarly, other combinations. However, if we have a joint measurement where both m1 and m2 are -1, that would mean m = -2, right? So that would belong to the l=2, m=-2 state, maybe?

Therefore, actually, in the state |2,-1>, there can't be a component where m1 and m2 are both -1, because that would require m = -2. Therefore, maybe the coefficient is zero? Hence, the probability is zero. But that seems too quick. Let me verify.

Wait, is |2,-1> formed from combining m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. So possible m1 and m2 combinations are: 
(-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2) which doesn't exist, ( -2, 1) which doesn't exist, as m can only be -1, 0, +1 for each electron. So the possible terms are m1 = -1, m2 =0; m1=0, m2=-1; m1=1, m2=-2 which is invalid. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2= -1>.

But wait, maybe other combinations? Wait no, all combinations where m1 + m2 = -1 and m1, m2 in {-1, 0, +1} are only (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the coupled state |2,-1> should be a linear combination of those two. Therefore, there are no components with m1=-1 and m2=-1, since m1+m2=-2, which doesn't match our m=-1. Therefore, the coefficient for m1=-1, m2=-1 should be zero, so the probability is zero. Hence, the answer is zero?

But wait, maybe I need to be more careful here. Because in the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, perhaps I need to consider how the state |2,-1> is built from the uncoupled states.

Recalling that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states to get l=2. The total state |l=2, m> is a combination of |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = m.

For example, |2, 2> is |1,1> |1,1>, and |2,1> is made from |1,1> and |1,0>, etc. The general formula for |l, m> is constructed by applying the lowering operator to the highest state.

So let's reconstruct |2,-1>.

Starting from |2,2>, which is |1,1> ⊗ |1,1>.

Then, applying the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2-:

L- |2,2> = (L1- + L2-)|1,1>|1,1> = ħ√(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,0>|1,1> + ħ√(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,1>|1,0>  
Wait, perhaps in a simpler way, the coefficients when applying the lowering operator is given by √(l(l+1) - m(m-1)).

Wait, this seems messy. Instead of deriving from scratch, maybe look up or recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 states. Let's do that.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l1=1 and l2=1 to get total L=2. For each m in L=2, we need the coefficients.

For example, |2,2> is |1,1>|1,1>, so coefficient 1.

Then, for |2,1>, applying the lowering operator once, the coefficients would be:

The state is a combination of |1,1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,1>. The coefficients can be determined by orthogonality and normalization. But maybe the coefficients are sqrt(1/2) and sqrt(1/2). Similarly, for |2,0>, it would involve |1,1>|1,-1>, |1,-1>|1,1>, |1,0>|1,0> in some combination. But perhaps I need more precise coefficients.

Alternatively, online the coupling of two l=1 states gives states from L=2,1,0. For each L, m from -L to L.

But for L=2, m=-1: the CG coefficients for |2,-1> would be a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Similarly, applying the lowering operator to the |2,0> state. But maybe actually the coefficients for |2,-1> should be the same as |2,1> but with m1 and m2 signs flipped? Maybe.

If symmetry is considered, then the coefficient can be constructed by flipping the signs.

Alternatively, check standard tables. Let me check Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for 1⊗1→2.

I remember that the coefficients for |2, m> would be:

|2, 2> = |1,1>|1,1>

|2, 1> = (|1,1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,1>)/√2

|2, 0> = (|1,1>|1,-1> + |1,-1>|1,1> + sqrt(2)|1,0>|1,0>)/√?

Wait, perhaps the coefficients for |2,0> are (|1,1>|1,-1> + |1,-1>|1,1> + something else)/sqrt(something). Wait, actually, the different pathways for getting to m=0 would include more terms.

Alternatively, perhaps |2, 0> is constructed using three terms, as the combination of m1=1,m2=-1; m1=-1,m2=1; and m1=0,m2=0, but normalized appropriately.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is needed. However, since the user is specifically asking about |2, -1>, let's think about that.

From the previous, |2, m> for m= -1 would be a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. Because if we apply the lowering operator to the |2,0> state, we can get to |2,-1>.

Wait, perhaps if we start from |2,0>, applying L-:

L- |2,0> = sqrt(2(2+1) - 0(-1)) |2,-1> = sqrt(6) |2,-1>

But also, L- = L1- + L2-, so L- |2,0> would act on the components of |2,0>.

If |2,0> is [ |1,1> |1,-1> + |1,-1> |1,1> + sqrt{?} |1,0> |1,0> ] normalized.

But this seems complicated. Perhaps an easier way is to look for symmetry.

Given that the state |2,-1> must be symmetric under exchange of the two particles (since they are electrons in orbital angular momentum states, but spin is being ignored - wait, actually, are we considering the spatial part or the spin part? Wait, in the problem statement, it's specified to "ignore their spin angular momentum", so we are considering the orbital angular momentum only. Therefore, the full state is the spatial part, and since the electrons are fermions, the total wavefunction (spatial*spin) must be antisymmetric. But since the problem is explicitly saying to ignore spin, maybe we're just dealing with the spatial part here, and maybe antisymmetry doesn't necessarily apply? Wait, but even when ignoring spin, electrons are fermions, so the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Since spin is ignored, perhaps the problem is not considering it, but perhaps in reality, the spatial part is symmetric or antisymmetric depending on spin. But the problem states: "ignoring their spin angular momentum", so maybe we just consider the spatial state, regardless of antisymmetry? Therefore, since the problem is given as just the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, I think we have to consider it as a symmetric spatial state. Since orbital angular momentum coupling when l1 = l2 =1 gives states with certain symmetry.

But maybe this is complicating things. The problem says to ignore the spin, so maybe we can consider the spatial state |1,1,2,-1> is properly antisymmetrized, but how? Or maybe it is assumed that since spin is ignored, we don't have to worry about antisymmetrization?

I think perhaps the problem is presented in a way that we can take the given state as a valid spatial state, not worrying about the Pauli exclusion principle, since spin is being ignored. So proceed without worrying about antisymmetry.

Therefore, back to the case: we need to express |2, -1> in terms of the uncoupled basis.

Given that total m = -1.

The possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum = -1

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum=-1

These are the two possible combinations where m1 + m2 = -1 and both m1 and m2 are within their possible values (-1,0,1). Therefore, the coupled state |2, -1> must be a linear combination of these two, possibly with specific coefficients.

Given that states with total angular momentum l=2 are symmetric under exchange of the two particles. Therefore, the coefficients should reflect that.

Assuming that, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states to get an l=2 state are symmetric:

For |2,1> state: (|1,1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,1>)/√2

Similarly, |2,-1> state would be: (|1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1>)/√2. Wait, but in this case, sum of m is -1, so:

|2,-1> = 1/√2 (| -1, 0 〉 + | 0, -1 〉 ). Therefore, this would be the expansion.

But wait, starting with |2,2> = |1,1>|1,1>

Then apply lowering operator L- = L1- +L2-.

So for |2,2>:

Applying L-:

L-|2,2> = (L1- + L2-)|1,1>|1,1>

Result: ħ √(2(2+1) -2(2-1)} |2,1>  
Wait, unfortunately, that's the general formula? Wait, for state |l, m>, lowering operator gives:

L-|l, m> = ħ √{l(l+1) - m(m-1)} |l, m-1>

But since here we are starting with |2,2>, apply L- = L1- + L2-.

But need to compute L1- on the first particle and L2- on the second. 

So (L1- + L2-)|1,1>|1,1> = L1- |1,1> |1,1> + |1,1> L2- |1,1>  

= sqrt(1*2 - 1*0) ħ |1,0> |1,1> + sqrt(1*2 - 1*0) ħ |1,1> |1,0>

= ħ sqrt(2) ( |1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> )

On the other hand, from the general formula, applying L- to |2,2>:

L-|2,2> = sqrt(2*3 - 2*1) ħ |2,1> = sqrt(4) ħ |2,1> = 2 ħ |2,1>

Therefore, equate the two:

2 ħ |2,1> = ħ sqrt(2) ( |1,0> |1,1> + |1,1> |1,0> )

Divide both sides by ħ:

2 |2,1> = sqrt(2) ( |1,0,1,1> + |1,1,1,0> )

Therefore,

|2,1> = (|1,0,1,1> + |1,1,1,0>)/sqrt(2)

Similarly, then applying L- to |2,1> to get |2,0>.

Compute L-|2,1> = (L1- + L2-)|2,1>

= (L1- + L2-)(|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>)/sqrt(2)

First, L1-|1,0> = sqrt(1*2 - 0*(-1)) |1,-1> = sqrt(2) |1,-1>

L2-|1,1> = sqrt(1*2 -1*0) |1,0> = sqrt(2) |1,0>

Similarly, L1-|1,1> = sqrt(2) |1,0>

L2-|1,0> = sqrt(2) |1,-1>

Thus,

For the first term (L1- acting on |1,0> and L2- acting on |1,1>):

sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) [ |1,-1> |1,1> + |1,0> |1,0> ] 

plus the second term (acting L1- on |1,1> and L2- on |1,0>):

sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)[ |1,0> |1,0> + |1,1> |1,-1> ]

Wait, wait, let me do this step by step:

Breaking down:

(L1- + L2-)(|1,0> |1,1> + |1,1> |1,1>)... wait no,

Actually,

Break down L-|2,1>:

Resulting terms:

L1- |1,0> |1,1> / sqrt(2) + L2- |1,0> |1,1> / sqrt(2) + L1- |1,1> |1,0> / sqrt(2) + L2- |1,1> |1,0> / sqrt(2)

Calculating each:

1. L1- |1,0> |1,1> = sqrt(2) |1,-1> |1,1>
2. L2- |1,0> |1,1> = sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,0>
3. L1- |1,1> |1,0> = sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,0>
4. L2- |1,1> |1,0> = sqrt(2) |1,1> |1,-1>

Therefore, adding all up:

[ sqrt(2) |1,-1> |1,1> + sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,0> + sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,0> + sqrt(2) |1,1> |1,-1> ] / sqrt(2)

Combine similar terms:

sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) [ |1,-1> |1,1> + |1,1> |1,-1> + 2 |1,0> |1,0> ]

Which simplifies to:

[ |1,-1,1,1> + |1,1,1,-1> + 2 |1,0,1,0> ]

Alternatively, divided by sqrt(2):

Wait, summarizing:

(Term1: sqrt(2) |1,-1>|1,1> )

(Term2: sqrt(2) |1,0>|1,0> )

(Term3: sqrt(2) |1,0>|1,0> )

(Term4: sqrt(2) |1,1>|1,-1> )

So adding the terms: sqrt(2) (Term1 + Term4) + sqrt(2) (Term2 + Term3) = sqrt(2)[ |1,-1>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,-1> ] + sqrt(2)*2 |1,0>|1,0>

Then dividing by sqrt(2):

[ (sqrt(2)( part1 ) + sqrt(2)*2* part2 ) ] /sqrt(2) = [ part1 + 2 part2 ]

Therefore, we have:

|1,-1>|1,1> + |1,1> |1,-1> + 2 |1,0> |1,0>

Therefore, that's L- |2,1>:

But also, from the general formula:

L- |2,1> = sqrt(2*3 -1*0) |2,0> = sqrt(6) |2,0>

Therefore, sqrt(6) |2,0> = |1,-1>|1,1> + |1,1> |1,-1> + 2 |1,0> |1,0>

Hence, |2,0> = [ |1,-1> |1,1> + |1,1> |1,-1> + 2 |1,0>|1,0> ] / sqrt(6)

Then, continuing to apply L- to get to |2, -1>:

Apply L- := L1- + L2- again to |2,0>

Calculating L- |2,0> would give:

sqrt(2*3 -0*(-1)) |2,-1> = sqrt(6) |2,-1>

Similarly, apply L- = L1- + L2- to each term of |2,0>:

First term: |1,-1> |1,1>

Apply L1-: already down to m=-1, so L1- |1,-1> = 0

Wait, no:

Wait, in the term |1,-1>|1,1>, applying L- operators:

L- (|1,-1> |1,1>) = (L1- |1,-1>) |1,1> + |1,-1> (L2- |1,1>)

Compute:

L1- |1,-1> = 0 (since m1 = -1 is already the lowest)

L2- |1,1> = sqrt(1*(1+1) -1*(1-1)) |1,0> = sqrt(2) |1,0>

Hence, the result for first term: sqrt(2) |1,-1> |1,0>

Second term: |1,1> |1,-1>

Similarly, apply L-:

L- (|1,1> |1,-1>) = (L1- |1,1>) |1,-1> + |1,1> (L2- |1,-1>)

= sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,-1> + 0

Third term: 2 |1,0> |1,0>

Apply L-:

= 2 ( L1- |1,0> |1,0> + |1,0> L2- |1,0> )

For each part:

L1- |1,0> = sqrt(2) |1,-1>

L2- |1,0> = sqrt(2) |1,-1>

Thus,

2* [ sqrt(2) |1,-1> |1,0> + sqrt(2) |1, 0> |1,-1> ]

= 2sqrt(2) [ |1,-1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> ]

Hence, putting all together:

L- |2,0> = sqrt(2) |1,-1> |1,0> + sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,-1> + 2sqrt(2) [ |1,-1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> ]

Total =

sqrt(2)*(1 + 2) [ |1,-1>|1,0> ] + sqrt(2)*(1 + 2)[ |1,0>|1,-1> ]

Wait, no, let's sum them:

First term from second term components:

sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,-1>

From first term: sqrt(2) |1,-1> |1,0>

From third term: 2sqrt(2) |1,-1> |1,0> + 2sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,-1>

Hence, total of sqrt(2 + 2sqrt(2))? Wait no:

Wait, the contributions are:

For |1,-1> |1,0>:

First term: sqrt(2) [from first component]

Third term: 2sqrt(2) [from third component]

Total for this: sqrt(2) + 2sqrt(2) = 3sqrt(2)

Similarly for |1,0> |1,-1>:

Second term: sqrt(2)

Third term: 2sqrt(2)

Total: sqrt(2) + 2sqrt(2)=3sqrt(2)

Hence, L- |2,0> = 3sqrt(2)( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

But according to the general formula, we have:

L-|2,0> = sqrt(2*3 -0*(-1)) |2,-1> = sqrt(6) |2,-1>

Hence,

sqrt(6) |2,-1> = 3sqrt(2) ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

Dividing both sides by sqrt(6):

|2,-1> = (3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6)) ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

Simplify the coefficient:

3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = 3 / sqrt(3) = sqrt(3). Because sqrt(6) = sqrt(2*3) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(3), so 3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = 3sqrt(2)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(3)) )= 3/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3). Hence,

|2,-1> = sqrt(3) ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) ? Wait that can't be, since norm squared.

Wait sqrt(3) squared is 3. But the states (|1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) each have a norm squared of 1, but when summed, since they are orthogonal?

Wait no, let's compute the norm of |1,-1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1>:

⟨ ( ⟨a| ⟨b| + ⟨b|⟨a| ) ( |a⟩ |b⟩ + |b⟩ |a⟩ )⟩

= ⟨a|a⟩⟨b|b⟩ + ⟨a|b⟩ ⟨b|a⟩ + ⟨b|a⟩ ⟨a|b⟩ + ⟨b|b⟩⟨a|a⟩

Assuming that |a⟩ = |1,-1⟩ and |b⟩=|1,0⟩.

Then, since ⟨a|a⟩ =1, likewise ⟨b|b⟩=1. And ⟨a|b⟩=0 because different m. So it becomes 1*1 +0 +0 +1*1=2.

Hence, the norm of |a⟩|b⟩ + |b⟩ |a⟩ is sqrt(2). Therefore, (1/√2)( |a b> + |b a> ) is normalized.

But in our case above, |2,-1> is written as sqrt(3) times ( |a b> + |b a> )

Then, constructed from:

sqrt(3)*( |a b> + |b a> ). The norm squared of this would be 3*(2) =6. But |2,-1> is a normalized state, so coefficient should be 1/sqrt(2).

But from our previous derivation, we have a contradiction here.

Wait, because we found that sqrt(6)|2,-1> =3sqrt(2)(|a b>+|b a>). Then, dividing both sides by sqrt(6):

|2,-1> = (3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6)) ( |a b> + |b a> )

= (3/sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ( |a b> + |b a> )

Wait, 3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = 3/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3). But confirming:

sqrt(6) is sqrt(2*3)=sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). Hence:

3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6)=3sqrt(2)/(sqrt(2)sqrt(3))=3/sqrt(3)=sqrt(3)

But sqrt(3)*( |a b> + |b a> ) has norm sqrt(3)^2 * (inner product of (|a b> + |b a>)

The inner product, as before, is 2, hence the norm squared would be sqrt(3)^2 *2= 3*2=6, which makes |2,-1> norm squared computed as sqrt(6)|2,-1> and the RHS norm squared is 6 which is correct.

But |2,-1> is supposed to have norm 1. But in our calculation,  sqrt(6) |2,-1> = 3sqrt(2)(|a b> + ...), indicates that |2,-1> is has a coefficient of the combination sqrt(3)*(|a b> + |b a>).

But wait, maybe our previous step was wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine:

We had L-|2,0> = sqrt(6) |2,-1>

L-|2,0>：

Earlier derivation got L- |2,0> = 3sqrt(2)( |1,-1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> )

But sqrt(6)|2,-1> should equal to L-|2,0>. Therefore,

sqrt(6)|2,-1> = 3sqrt(2)( |1,-1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> )

Thus,

|2,-1> = (3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6)) ( |1,-1> |1,0> + |1,0> |1,-1> )

= 3/(sqrt(3)) ( ... ) ?

sqrt(2)/sqrt(6)=1/sqrt(3)

Yes, 3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6)=3/sqrt(3)=sqrt(3)

Therefore, \\\*

|2,-1> = sqrt(3)*( 1/sqrt(2) ) ( | -1, 0> + | 0, -1> )

Wait, but  when squaring sqrt(3)*sqrt(1/2), but maybe not. Wait.

Alternatively, trancription perhaps wrong? Wait, Wait if |2,-1> = sqrt(3) * (| -1,0> + |0, -1> ). Then, the normalization would be sqrt(3)^2*(1 +1)=3*2=6. Which would seem too big. But if |2,-1> is supposed to be a normalized state, then this contradicts.

However, we arrived at this through application of lowering operator. So what's wrong here?

Alternatively, I might have miscalculated the coefficients when applying L-.

Wait, going back:

Let me compute L- |2,0> carefully:

The |2,0> state is ( |1,1> |1,-1> + |1,-1> |1,1> + 2 |1,0> |1,0> ) / sqrt(6)

So applying L- to each term:

First term: |1,1> |1,-1>

L- |1,1> |1,-1> = (L1- + L2-)|1,1> |1,-1> = \sqrt{2} |1,0> |1,-1> + \sqrt{0} |1,1> |1,-2> HOLD ON!

Wait, L2- |1,-1> acts on the second particle. But L2- on |1,-1> with m = -1 gives zero, because it's the lowest state.

So correct evaluation:

First term:

L1- |1,1> |1,-1>:

= \sqrt(1*(1+1) -1*(1-1) |> → sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,-1>

L2- |1,-1> is sqrt(1*2 - (-1)(-1 -1) ). Wait, is this correct? No.

Wait, the L- operator on state |l, m> is sqrt( l(l+1) - m(m-1) ) |l, m-1> where.

But /recipy. L+ is m raised, and L- lowers m.

Hence applying L- on |l=1, m=-1> is zero.

Because m=-1 is the lowest, you can't go lower. So for L2- |1,-1> =0.

Thus,

First term: sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,-1>

Second term: |1,-1> |1,1>

Similarly, L1- |1,-1>=0, L2- |1,1>=sqrt(2)|1,0>, so total:

 sqrt（2） |1,-1> |1,0>

Third term: 2 |1,0> |1,0>

Apply L- = L1- + L2-:

L1- |1,0> = sqrt(2)|1,-1>

L2- |1,0>= sqrt(2)|1,-1>

Hence,

Sum:

2*(sqrt(2) |1,-1> |1,0> + sqrt(2) |1,0> |1,-1> )

Putting all three terms together:

First term: sqrt(2) |0,-1>

Second term: sqrt(2)|-1,0>

Third term: 2sqrt(2)| -1,0> + 2sqrt(2)|0,-1>

Total for | -1,0> components:

sqrt(2) (from second term) + 2sqrt(2) (from third term) = 3sqrt(2)|-1,0>

Similarly, |0,-1> components:

sqrt(2)(first term) +2sqrt(2)(third term)=3sqrt(2)|0,-1>

Hence, overall:

L- |2,0> = 3sqrt(2)( |-1,0> + |0,-1> )

Which equals sqrt(6) |2,-1>. Therefore:

sqrt(6) )|2,-1> = 3sqrt(2)( |-1,0 > + |0, -1> )

Thus:

|2, -1> = (3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6)) ( |-1,0> + |0,-1> )

Note that consistent with this reduces to:

3 sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = 3 / sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)

Hence,

|2,-1> = sqrt(3) * ( |-1,0> + |0,-1> ) / sqrt(2)

Wait, but if we arrange  the combination as ( |-1,0> + |0,-1> ) normalized by sqrt(2), times sqrt(3). But sqrt(3)*1/sqrt(2). However, the coefficient would then be sqrt(3/2).

But hmmm calculating coefficients.

But perhaps previous calculation has an error. Let me check:

3sqrt(2) / sqrt(6) = 3 / sqrt(3) = sqrt(3) which is generally correct.

But therefore, the normalized state is:

|2,-1> = sqrt(3) ( |-1,0> + |0,-1> )

Divided by sqrt( |-1,0> + |0,-1> component's norm.

But I had found that (｜-1,0> + |0,-1> ) has norm sqrt(2). Therefore:

( | -1,0> + |0 , -1> ) / sqrt(2) is a normalized state.

Therefore, multiplying what's claimed:

sqrt(3) * That state would give |2,-1> = sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) ( |-1,0> + |0,-1> )

But the true norm of the state would be sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) times the norm of (|-1,0> + |0,-1> ) which is sqrt(2), so the total would sqrt(3)/sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) )= sqrt(3). Hence, something's wrong because |2,-1> should be normalized to 1.

This inconsistency suggests somewhere miscalculation in coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps when we applied lowering operator, we did miscalculate coefficients?

Alternatively, perhaps the error is earlier when using L- → L- |2,0>

Wait, we initially found that in |2,0> state: ( |1,1> |1,-1> + |1,-1> |1,1> + 2|1,0> |1,0> ) / sqrt(6) ?

Wait, what's the inner product of that?

Each term: |1,1>|1,-1><1,-1| <1,1| → Cross terms?

No, if you normalize the entire state:

( |1,1> |1,-1> + |1,-1> |1,1> ) part: each term is normalized when considered in the combined space.

But actually, this is a symmetric combination, so:

⟨ ( <1,1| <1,-1| + <1,-1| <1,1| ) (|1,1>|1,-1> + |1,-1>|1,1> ) ⟩

= ⟨1,1|1,1⟩⟨1,-1|1,-1⟩ + ⟨1,1|1,-1⟩⟨1,-1|1,1⟩ + ⟨1,-1|1,1⟩⟨1,1|1,-1⟩ + ⟨1,-1|1,-1⟩ ⟨1,1|1,1⟩

= 1*1 +0 +0 +1*1=2

Similarly, then adding 2 |1,0>|1,0> :

Norm squared is (2)^2 *1=4

Total inner product:

But wait, full state is:

( |1,1>|1,-1> + |1,-1>|1,1> +2|1,0>|1,0> ) / sqrt(6)

Computing inner product:

(1^2 +1^2 + (2)^2 ) divided by 6

Because Each part's coefficients squared: 1,1,2. Squared are 1,1,4, sum to 6. Therefore divided by sqrt(6), yeh, normalized correctly.

Then applying L- to it, and getting 3sqrt(2)( |−1,0〉 +|0,−1〉).

But then when comparing to state |2,−1〉 which should have been normalized, this leads L–|20〉ket= sqrt(6)|2,−1〉,
which equals 3 sqrt(2〉 ( || a, b's components ), making |2,−1〉= 3 sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) ( ... ) = sqrt(3)( ... ). Perhaps accepted leading to three systems to Compu kg by figuring out the proper normalization.

Anyway, regardless of the Clebsch-Gordan factors, coming back to the OP’s question:

The given state |1,1,2,-1> corresponds to |j=2, m=-1> when combining two l=1 states. To find the probability that both electrons have m=-1, we need to expand |2,-1> in terms of |m1, m2> states and check if there's any component with m1=-1 and m2=-1.

But in the discussion, I noted that m1 + m2 =-1 here. Since each m can be -1,0,1. Therefore, for such a sum, the possible combinations are (m1=-1, m2=0) and（m1=0, m2=-1). Hence, there should be ZERO component with m1=m2=-1. So their individual پاسخprobability would also be zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the joint probability of both electrons having an eigenvalue of -ħ for their Lz components when the combined state is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, let me think about how angular momentum coupling works here.

First, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled state, which means it's a combination of the individual states of each electron's angular momentum. Since we're dealing with two p orbitals, each has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The total angular momentum here is l = 2 and m = -1. So, this state is part of the triplet (or quintet?) of states with total angular momentum 2. But wait, when you combine two l=1 states, the possible total angular momenta are l = 2, 1, 0. So l=2 is the highest, then 1, then 0. Since the given state is |1,1,2,-1>, that's a state with total l=2 and m=-1.

Now, the problem is asking for the joint probability of measuring L1z and L2z both as -ħ. That is, what's the probability that when we measure the z-component of each electron's orbital angular momentum, both are -ħ. Since the eigenvalues of Lz for l=1 are m=-1, 0, +1 times ħ, so the possible outcomes for each are -ħ, 0, +ħ for each electron.

To find the joint probability, I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled basis states |l1, m1> |l2, m2>. Then, find the coefficient for the term where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, and take the square of the absolute value of that coefficient.

So the key here is to use the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state |l=2, m=-1> in the coupled basis can be written as a linear combination of the uncoupled states where m1 + m2 = -1. Because in the coupled basis, m = m1 + m2. Since we're looking for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, that sum would be -2, which doesn't match the total m=-1. So, actually, would there be a component where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 in the |2,-1> state? Wait, no. Because m1 + m2 is -1 for the total state. So if m1 = -1, then m2 must satisfy m1 + m2 = -1 => -1 + m2 = -1 => m2=0. Similarly, other combinations. However, if we have a joint measurement where both m1 and m2 are -1, that would mean m = -2, right? So that would belong to the l=2, m=-2 state, maybe?

Therefore, actually, in the state |2,-1>, there can't be a component where m1 and m2 are both -1, because that would require m = -2. Therefore, maybe the coefficient is zero? Hence, the probability is zero. But that seems too quick. Let me verify.

Wait, is |2,-1> formed from combining m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. So possible m1 and m2 combinations are: 
(-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2) which doesn't exist, ( -2, 1) which doesn't exist, as m can only be -1, 0, +1 for each electron. So the possible terms are m1 = -1, m2 =0; m1=0, m2=-1; m1=1, m2=-2 which is invalid. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2= -1>.

But wait, maybe other combinations? Wait no, all combinations where m1 + m2 = -1 and m1, m2 in {-1, 0, +1} are only (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the coupled state |2,-1> should be a linear combination of those two. Therefore, there are no components with m1=-1 and m2=-1, since m1+m2=-2, which doesn't match our m=-1. Therefore, the coefficient for m1=-1, m2=-1 should be zero, so the probability is zero. Hence, the answer is zero?

But wait, maybe I need to be more careful here. Because in the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, perhaps I need to consider how the state |2,-1> is built from the uncoupled states.

Recalling that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states to get l=2. The total state |l=2, m> is a combination of |m1, m2> such that m1 + m2 = m.

For example, |2, 2> is |1,1> |1,1>, and |2,1> is made from |1,1> and |1,0>, etc. The general formula for |l, m> is constructed by applying the lowering operator to the highest state.

So let's reconstruct |2,-1>.

Starting from |2,2>, which is |1,1> ⊗ |1,1>.

Then, applying the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2-:

L- |2,2> = (L1- + L2-)|1,1>|1,1> = ħ√(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,0>|1,1> + ħ√(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,1>|1,0>  
Wait, perhaps in a simpler way, the coefficients when applying the lowering operator is given by √(l(l+1) - m(m-1)).

Wait, this seems messy. Instead of deriving from scratch, maybe look up or recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for two l=1 states. Let's do that.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l1=1 and l2=1 to get total L=2. For each m in L=2, we need the coefficients.

For example, |2,2> is |1,1>|1,1>, so coefficient 1.

Then, for |2,1>, applying the lowering operator once, the coefficients would be:

The state is a combination of |1,1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,1>. The coefficients can be determined by orthogonality and normalization. But maybe the coefficients are sqrt(1/2) and sqrt(1/2). Similarly, for |2,0>, it would involve |1,1>|1,-1>, |1,-1>|1,1>, |1,0>|1,0> in some combination. But perhaps I need more precise coefficients.

Alternatively, online the coupling of two l=1 states gives states from L=2,1,0. For each L, m from -L to L.

But for L=2, m=-1: the CG coefficients for |2,-1> would be a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Similarly, applying the lowering operator to the |2,0> state. But maybe actually the coefficients for |2,-1> should be the same as |2,1> but with m1 and m2 signs flipped? Maybe.

If symmetry is considered, then the coefficient can be constructed by flipping the signs.

Alternatively, check standard tables. Let me check Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for 1⊗1→2.

I remember that the coefficients for |2, m> would be:

|2, 2> = |1,1>|1,1>

|2, 1> = (|1,1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,1>)/√2

|2, 0> = (|1,1>|1,-1> + |1,-1>|1,1> + sqrt(2)|1,0>|1,0>)/√?

Wait, perhaps the coefficients for |2,0> are (|1,1>|1,-1> + |1,-1>|1,1> + something else)/sqrt(something). Wait, actually, the different pathways for getting to

# Anthropic completion

To find the joint probability of both electrons having an eigenvalue of -ħ for their Lz components when the combined state is |1,1,2,-1>, I need to analyze angular momentum coupling carefully.

The state |1,1,2,-1> represents a coupled state where each electron has orbital angular momentum l1 = l2 = 1 (p orbitals), with total angular momentum l = 2 and total magnetic quantum number m = -1. When combining two l=1 states, the possible total angular momenta are l = 2, 1, or 0, with l=2 being the highest possible value.

For calculating the joint probability of measuring L1z and L2z both as -ħ, I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of uncoupled basis states |l1, m1⟩|l2, m2⟩. The probability will be the square of the absolute value of the coefficient for the term where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

In the coupled basis, m equals m1 + m2. Since our coupled state has m = -1, any uncoupled states that contribute must have m1 + m2 = -1. If both electrons had m1 = m2 = -1, their sum would be -2, not matching our required total m = -1. Therefore, the state |1,1,2,-1⟩ can only contain components where m1 + m2 = -1, such as (m1 = -1, m2 = 0) or (m1 = 0, m2 = -1).

The possible combinations for m1 and m2 that satisfy m1 + m2 = -1 (where each can only take values -1, 0, or +1) are:
- m1 = -1, m2 = 0
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1

There is no component with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 in the |1,1,2,-1⟩ state because their sum would be -2, inconsistent with our total m = -1.

Using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, we could express |2,-1⟩ in terms of |m1, m2⟩ states where m1 + m2 = -1. We could start from |2,2⟩ = |1,1⟩|1,1⟩ and apply lowering operators, or look up the coefficients directly.

Since no term with m1 = m2 = -1 exists in the expansion of |1,1,2,-1⟩, the coefficient for this combination is zero, making the joint probability of both electrons having Lz = -ħ equal to zero.

Certainly! Here's the rephrased version:

I need to determine the joint probability that both electrons have an eigenvalue of -ħ for their Lz components when the combined state is |1,1,2,-1>. Let's consider the principles of angular momentum coupling.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled one, implying it results from combining the angular momentum states of individual electrons. With two p orbitals involved, l1 = 1 and l2 = 1 for each. The combined state shows a total angular momentum l = 2 and m = -1, suggesting it's part of the set of states with a total angular momentum of 2. But when two l=1 states merge, possible total angular momenta are l = 2, 1, 0. Thus, l=2 represents the maximum, followed by 1 and then 0. Considering the state presented, |1,1,2,-1> corresponds to l=2 and m=-1.

The task requires the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. In other words, determining the likelihood that measuring the z-component of each electron’s orbital angular momentum will yield -ħ. Since for l=1, the eigenvalues of Lz are m=-1, 0, +1 times ħ, the potential results are -ħ, 0, +ħ per electron.

To ascertain the joint probability, we express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> through the uncoupled basis states |l1, m1> |l2, m2>. Then locate the coefficient for the term with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, square its absolute value.

We'll employ the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coupled state |l=2, m=-1> correlates to a linear amalgamation of uncoupled states where m1 + m2 = -1. Given that in the coupled basis, m = m1 + m2, with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, this sum amounts to -2, conflicting with m=-1. So, is there a component with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 in the |2,-1> state? Actually no, since m1 + m2 = -1 should hold, if m1 = -1 then m1 + m2 = -1 seamlessly results in m2=0, and vice versa. However, if both m1 and m2 = -1, this warrants m = -2, which we might see in the l=2, m=-2 state.

Consequently, the |2,-1> state holds no component where both m1 and m2 equal -1, since that condition nudges m=-2. Hence, the coefficient is presumed zero, suggesting zero probability. It appears quite sudden, but verification is needed.

Reflecting on |2,-1> creation through m1 and m2 addition, verify possible m1 and m2 combinations: (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2) (which is non-existent), and (-2, 1) (non-existent too). Both m can only have values -1, 0, +1 per electron. Thus, |1,1,2,-1> should solely blend |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2= -1>.

Any overlooked combinations? No, for m1 + m2 = -1, choices for m1, m2 of –1, 0, +1 remain –1,0 and 0,-1 only. Hence, |2,-1> consists of these states, implying no counterpart with both m1 and m2 as -1. Thus, the coefficient is zero and results in zero probability. So, zero must be correct.

Yet, should I revisit specifics? Utilizing the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition shades light on |2,-1> creation with uncoupled states.

Remember, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients combine two l=1 states to total L=2. Each m in L=2 informs coefficients. Consider |2,2> as |1,1>|1,1>; for |2,1>, applying the lowering operator once unveils:

A mix of |1,1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,1>. Coefficients derived by orthogonality and normalization. Presumably √(1/2) and √(1/2) possibly. Similarly, |2,0> applies a combination of |1,1>|1,-1>, |1,-1>|1,1>, |1,0>|1,0>, perhaps with more precise coefficients.

Orleans, pre-existing coupling tables may have tackled L=2,1,0 for two l=1 states. For L=2, m=-1: Clebsch-Gordan coefficients bind |2,-1> from |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Subsequent lowering operator applications to |2,0>. Perhaps coefficients for |2,-1> mirror |2,1> (bearing m1 and m2 signs reversed)? Symmetry suggests sign reversal in constructing coefficients.

Or assess Clebsch-Gordan tables for 1⊗1→2. Recall coefficients for |2,m> are:

|2, 2> = |1,1>|1,1>

|2, 1> = (|1,1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,1>)/√2

|2, 0> = (|1,1>|1,-1> + |1,-1>|1,1> + √2|1,0>|1,0>)/√?

Perhaps |2,0> coefficients arise from (|1,1>|1,-1> + |1,-1>|1,1> + something else)/√(something). Yet, multiple pathway intricacies yield.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the joint probability of both electrons having eigenvalues of \(-\hbar\) for their \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) measurements when the combined state is \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\), we need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states \(|l_1, m_1\rangle |l_2, m_2\rangle\).

The given state \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\) has total angular momentum quantum numbers \(l = 2\) and \(m = -1\). The possible values of \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) for the individual electrons must satisfy \(m_1 + m_2 = -1\). Since each electron is in a p orbital (\(l = 1\)), the possible values for \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are \(-1, 0, +1\).

For the total \(m = -1\), the valid combinations of \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are:
- \(m_1 = -1\) and \(m_2 = 0\)
- \(m_1 = 0\) and \(m_2 = -1\)

Using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two \(l = 1\) states to form \(l = 2\), the state \(|2, -1\rangle\) is constructed as:
\[
|2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |1, -1\rangle |1, 0\rangle + |1, 0\rangle |1, -1\rangle \right)
\]

This indicates that the coupled state \(|2, -1\rangle\) is a superposition of the states where one electron has \(m = -1\) and the other has \(m = 0\). There is no component in this superposition where both electrons have \(m = -1\), as their sum would be \(-2\), which does not match \(m = -1\).

Therefore, the coefficient for the term \(|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle\) is zero, leading to a joint probability of zero. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]

0.

But for |2,-1>, it should be (|1,0>|1,-1> + |1,-1>|1,0>)/√2.

Wait, similar to how |2,1> is the symmetric combination of m1=1 and m2=0, and m1=0 and m2=1, then |2,-1> should be the symmetric combination of m1=-1 and m2=0, and m1=0 and m2=-1. However, since it's symmetric, this combination is (|1, -1> |1, 0> + |1, 0> |1, -1>)/sqrt(2). But wait, perhaps with a negative sign because of the lowering operation? Wait, need to confirm.

But, in the case of L=2, for |2,1>:

Using lowering operators, starting from |2,2> (which is |1,1>|1,1>), then acting with L-:

L-|2,2> = (L1- + L2組み合わせ)|1,1>|1,1> = √(2*3 - 2*1) |1,0>|1,1> + √(same) |1,1>|1,0> then normalized.

Wait, √(l(l+1) - m(m-1)) is the coefficient for the lowering operator. For l=1, m=1, so √(1(1+1) - 1(0)) = √(2). Then:

L- |1,1>|1,1> = √2 ħ |1,0>|1,1> + √2 ħ |1,1>|1,0>

Thus, to get |2,1>, divide by √( (√2)^2 + (√2)^2 ) = √(4) = 2, so the state is (|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>)/√2.

Similarly, apply the lowering operator again to |2,1> to get |2,0>.

But let's skip that. Now, applying lowering operator to |2,1> to get |2,0>:

But actually, we need to get |2,-1> so perhaps first get |2,0>, then |2,-1>, etc. But maybe there is another approach.

Alternatively, knowing that the state |2,-1> can be obtained as the time-reversed version of |2,1>, so if you take the complex conjugate and invert the m's. So since |2,1> is (|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0>)/√2, then |2,-1> would be (|1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1>)/√2.

Assuming this is the case, which makes sense in terms of symmetry. So then yes, |2,-1> is the symmetric combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

If that's the case, then in the expansion of |2,-1> in terms of uncoupled states, there are no components where both m1 and m2 are -1, so the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1> is 0, hence the probability is |0|^2=0. So, the joint probability would be zero. Hence, the answer is 0.

But let me check it in some tables. For instance, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for 1 × 1 = 2.

From a standard CG table:

                                      1                 1                             
                              Coefficient       
           L   m    m1   m2
           2   -1    0   -1      sqrt(1/2)
           2   -1   -1    0      sqrt(1/2)

So yes, according to this, the state |2,-1> is composed of the combination sqrt(1/2)|0,-1> + sqrt(1/2)|-1,0>. There are no other terms. Therefore, the component | -1, -1 > is not present in the expansion of |2,-1>. Therefore, the coefficient is 0. Therefore, the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 (i.e., L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ) is zero.

So the final answer should be 0. Therefore, the joint probability is 0.

Is that the case? So it looks like the answer is zero. Therefore, boxed, \boxed{0}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The joint probability of both electrons having \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) in the coupled state \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\) is **0**.

**Explanation:**

1. **Coupled vs. Uncoupled Basis:**
   - The coupled state \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\) describes the total angular momentum of the system. Here, \(l = 2\) and \(m = -1\).
   - To find the probability for specific individual \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) values, we must express the coupled state in the **uncoupled basis**: \(|m_1, m_2\rangle\), where \(m_1 + m_2 = m = -1\). The quantum numbers \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) correspond to the z-components of each electron's angular momentum.

2. **Possible \(m_1, m_2\) Combinations:**
   For two electrons in \(l=1\) states, allowed \(m_1, m_2\) values are \(\{ -1, 0, +1 \}\). In the coupled state \(|2,-1\rangle\), \(m_1 + m_2 = -1\). The valid combinations are:
   - \(m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\)
   - \(m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\)

3. **Absence of \((-1, -1)\) Component:**
   The combination \(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\) gives \(m_{\text{total}} = -2\), which is not part of the \(l=2, m=-1\) state. The Clebsch-Gordan expansion of \(|2,-1\rangle\) contains **no term** with \(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\). Thus, the amplitude for this outcome is 0.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   Probability = \(|\text{Coefficient}|^2\). Since the coefficient for \((-1, -1)\) is zero, the probability is \(0^2 = 0\).

**Conclusion:**  
There is no chance (\(0\%\) probability) of measuring both \(L_{1z} = -\hbar\) and \(L_{2z} = -\hbar\) in the state \(|1,1,2,-1\rangle\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) for the coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \), we need to express this state in terms of the uncoupled basis states \( |l_1, m_1\rangle |l_2, m_2\rangle \).

The coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) corresponds to the total angular momentum quantum number \( l = 2 \) and its z-component \( m = -1 \). The possible combinations of \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) (where \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \)) for two electrons in p orbitals (with \( l_1 = 1 \) and \( l_2 = 1 \)) are:

- \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = 0 \)
- \( m_1 = 0 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \)

Using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the state \( |2, -1\rangle \) can be written as a linear combination of these uncoupled states:
\[
|2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |1, -1\rangle |1, 0\rangle + |1, 0\rangle |1, -1\rangle \right)
\]

The component \( |1, -1\rangle |1, -1\rangle \) (which would give \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \)) is not present in this combination. Therefore, the coefficient for this component is zero, and hence the probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) is zero.

The joint probability is \boxed{0}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Starting from known |2,2>, and methodically lowering to get all the states.

Alternatively, consult CG coefficients. Wait, normally Clebsch-Gordan for two l=1 states combine into L=2,1,0. For each L and M, the coefficients can be calculated via recursion. Let me lay out the coefficients.

In CG coefficients for composing angular momenta: l1=1 and l2=1 into L.

For L=2, M=-1:

The possible combinations are, M = m1 + m2 = -1. So, m1, m2 pairs: (-1,0), (0,-1). Since m's can be -1,0,+1.

So, when L=2 and M=-1 = m1 + m2. So, the |2,-1> state is combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>.

Suppose it's symmetry with the |2,1> state which is ( |1,1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,1> ) /√2 . Perhaps the |2,-1> state is the same but with m's inverted: ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) /√2. So normalized.

Alternatively, since M is negative, check if the phases match, but likely √2 normalization.

Then, components contributing |2,-1> are only [-1,0> and |0,-1>, each with coefficient +1/√2.

Hence, there is no | -1, -1> term. Therefore, if we're measuring and detecting m1=-1 and m2=-1, the component does nothing, so the probability amplitude is zero.

However, the |2,-1> state is built from these two m1,m2 pairs. Therefore, the probability P(m1=-1, m2=-1) is zero.

Therefore, the answer is zero.

**Final Answer**
The joint probability is \boxed{0}.
