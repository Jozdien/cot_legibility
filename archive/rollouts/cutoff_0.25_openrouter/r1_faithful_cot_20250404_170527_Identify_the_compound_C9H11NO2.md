# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to identify a compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 using the given IR and 1H NMR data. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step. 

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Plugging in the numbers: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2, X=0. So, that's (2*9 + 2 - 11 - 0 + 1)/2 = (18 + 2 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So, 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean 1 ring plus 3 double bonds, or 2 rings and 2 double bonds, etc. Or some combination with triple bonds, though the IR might indicate.

Looking at the IR data: the medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Typically, primary amines have two peaks around that range (asymmetric and symmetric stretches), but since they are of medium to strong intensity, maybe they are from an amide? Wait, but amide N-H usually is around lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, it could be an amine group. The fact that there are two peaks close together might indicate a primary amine (two N-H stretches for -NH2). But then, usually, aromatic amines might have those peaks. Also, another strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, likely a carbonyl (C=O). The 1720 is typical for an ester (RCOOR) or perhaps a ketone or aldehyde. But esters usually have carbonyl around 1725-1740, maybe a little higher. However, conjugation can lower the wavenumber. Alternatively, an acid (but IR of acid would have a very broad O-H stretch around 3000-2500, which isn't mentioned here). So maybe an ester, given that there's no broad O-H, but I need to check other functional groups. Alternatively, amides have carbonyl around 1650, so not this. 

So possible carbonyl groups here: ester, ketone, maybe an aldehyde, but no aldehyde proton peak in NMR. So maybe ester. Then, in the NMR... wait, let's look at the NMR data.

1H NMR: 

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – triplet, integrating for 3H. Likely a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. Maybe a CH2CH3 group. So ethyl group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, integrating for 2H. Broad singlet suggests exchange, maybe NH2 or OH. But the IR suggested possibly NH2. Could this be an NH2 group? But how does that fit... However, the 4.0 ppm is in the range where maybe protons adjacent to an electronegative atom are found. Let me remember that. For amines, the NH protons are usually in the 1-5 ppm range but usually broader. Wait but the signal here is a broad singlet at 4.0 with 2H. If it's exchangeable protons, but how to distinguish between NH2 and OH? The IR peaks were at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are in the range for N-H stretches (for a primary amine), whereas O-H stretches (like alcohol or carboxylic acid) are broader and maybe lower (carboxylic acid is very broad). However, the IR didn't mention a strong or broad O-H peak, which for an alcohol would be around 3200-3600, maybe a sharp peak if it's not exchanging. But the fact that the IR has two medium to strong bands at ~3400 suggests NH2. Therefore, perhaps the 4.0 ppm signal is the NH2 protons. However, NH2 protons in amines are usually around 1-3 ppm, except in aromatic amines (like aniline), which can be upfield shifted, but also may be split into multiple peaks unless in a symmetrical environment. But perhaps the broad singlet is for NH2 in primary amine. However, how does this tie into the molecule?

Then, next NMR peaks:

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – quartet, integrating for 2H. A quartet adjacent to a triplet? If so, then maybe this is a CH2 connected to an O (like an ester group), so maybe OCH2CH3. However, we do have a triplet at 1.20 ppm integrating for 3H (the methyl). Therefore, if there is a CH2 next to O, then ethyl ester group: OCH2CH3. So the quartet at 4.5 would correlate with the triplet at 1.20. But wait, an ethyl ester typically would be split into a quartet for the methylene (OCH2CH3, where the OCH2 are split by the adjacent CH3). Wait, but usually in an ethyl ester (RCOOCH2CH3), the methyl group (CH3) is at ~1.2-1.4 as a triplet, and the methylene (OCH2) as a quartet ~4.0-4.3 ppm. Wait, but the quartet here is at 4.5. So maybe slightly deshielded, or part of another group. Alternatively, if there's an ethyl group attached to something else. Let me note that. If we have an OCH2CH3, then that's two protons as quartet; the integration here matches. But the shift is slightly higher. Let's put that thought on hold.

Then, in the NMR:

7.0 ppm (d, 2H); 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are two doublets. Possibly para-substituted aromatic protons. Coupling between the two sets, so a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, where the two protons on each ring are deshielded differently. So for example, if there are electron-withdrawing groups in the para positions.

So combination of a para-substituted aromatic ring, and an ethyl group (possibly part of an ester), maybe.

Piecing this together. Let's weave this into possible structures.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the possible groups.

The aromatic ring (benzene) is 6 carbons. If we have a para-substituted ring, two substituents. If one substituent is an ester group: COOEt (ethyl ester). That would take up COOCH2CH3 (which is 3 carbons). Then the remaining would be a NH2 group? Because we have the two NH2 protons?

Wait, let's tally that. The benzene is 6 C, then COOCH2CH3 is 3 Cs (C=O, O, CH2CH3). But that brings the count so far to 6 + 3 = 9? No. Because COOCH2CH3 is (COO-) plus (CH2CH3). But the benzene is 6 C, the ester is O=C-O-CH2CH3. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzene (6 C), ester (COOEt which is 4 C: C from carbonyl, two O, and Ethyl group (2 C). Wait no, COOCH2CH3 has three carbons (the carbonyl C, the O, then the ethyl group (2 Cs). So total carbonyl C (1) + O (2) + ethyl (2 C) and some H. Wait, maybe this is getting confusing. Let's actually build the molecule.

Suppose we have a para-substituted benzene ring. One substituent is an ethyl ester group (O=C-O-CH2CH3), and the other substituent is an amino group (-NH2). Then the formula would be: benzene (6 C) + COOCH2CH3 (COO is 1 C from the carbonyl and 2 O's which are not carbons, and CH2CH3 which is 2 C's). So total carbons from substituents: 1 (carbonyl C) + 2 (ethyl) = 3. Then plus the benzene C6 gives C9. Then nitrogen from the NH2 group. Oxygen from ester: the carbonyl and two oxygens (COO) gives two oxygen atoms (since COO- has two Os). Then the NH2 has a N. So checking the formula: C9 (6+3), H: benzene is 5 H (assuming two substituents), ester OCH2CH3: the ethyl is 5 H (ethyl ester has 5 H: CH3 3H, CH2 2H). Then NH2 has 2 H. Total H? Benzene (4 H if para substituents), ester OCH2CH3 (5 H), NH2 (2 H): 4+5+2=11 H. That matches C9H11. The formula adds N, O: N=1, O=2. So that matches C9H11NO2. Bingo. So the structure would be para-aminophenyl acetate ester. Wait, but acetate ester would be OAc, but in this case, substituents on the benzene: para positions one is NH2 and the other is OCOCH2CH3? Or is it inverted?

Actually, let's think. Ph-COOCH2CH3 and Ph-NH2 para?. Para-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester: ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Structure is O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2.

So, para-substituted benzoate ester with an NH2 group. 

Now, check NMR spectrum. Let's see the assignments:

- The ethyl group: OCH2CH3. The ethyl would have a quartet at ~4.2 ppm for the OCH2 and a triplet for the CH3 at ~1.3 ppm. However, in the given data, the triplet is at 1.20, and the quartet (OCH2) is at 4.5. Hmm, but ethyl esters usually have OCH2 around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. But shift to 4.5 might arise if there's a deshielding group nearby. Also, let's check Ar-NH2: in aniline NH2 protons are usually around 3.5-4.0 ppm as a broad peak (due to exchange). But according to some sources, NH2 in aromatic amines can be upfield. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) indicated in NMR. So NH2 could be those.

If that's the case, in the aromatic region, the protons ortho to the ester would be deshielded because the ester is electron-withdrawing. Then the two doublets: at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. So the para-substituted benzene with ester and amino groups. In ethyl para-aminobenzoate:

The benzene ring would have substituents at para positions:

O
|
O-C-OCH2CH3 (at one para position)
and NH2 (at the other para position).

In such a structure, the ortho protons adjacent to the ester group would be deshielded (downfield), and those adjacent to the amino group would be shielded a bit. Wait, but the amino is activating, so its para substituent (the ester, deactivating). Wait para-aminobenzoic acid ester. The H on the ring adjacent to COOEt would be more deshielded (downfield), and those adjacent to the NH2 (which is an activating group, meta to the ester) would be upfield. 

Wait, the ester group is electron-withdrawing (so it's a meta director), the amino group (NH2) is electron-donating, a strong activating group. So the amino group is in para position to the ester. So on the benzene ring, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt in para positions.

In such a case, the ring protons would be three groups: adjacent to NH2, adjacent to COOEt, and for the rest. But in a para disubstituted benzene, there would be two sets of two equivalent protons. Let's assign the coupling. Let's say the aromatic protons next to COOEt (ortho to COOEt) would be deshielded and as a doublet, and those next to NH2 (ortho to NH2) would be more upfield as a doublet. 

In the NMR, one doublet at 7.0 and another at 8.0 ppm. The downfield doublet at 8.0 is likely next to the COOEt group (since the ester is electron-withdrawing, making those protons deshielded). The upfield one at 7.0 would be adjacent to the NH2 group. So the two doublets: each coupling to the other, J around 8-9 Hz for para substituted.

So the aromatic signals: 7.0 ppm (d) and 8.0 ppm (d), each integrating for two protons. That matches. Then the NH2 protons: the 4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H), as amino group.

The ethyl ester group: triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). However, normal ethyl ester OCH2 quartets are usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But if the ester is adjacent to the electron-withdrawing group (like the aromatic ring conjugated to the ester carbonyl), perhaps it's deshielded, so upshifted to 4.5. Alternatively, maybe there's another group causing this shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 ppm is not the ethyl ester's OCH2. Wait, but where else would the quartet come from?

Wait, in the IR data, the strong carbonyl at 1720. While esters have carbonyl around 1725-1740. But this one is at 1720. Slightly downshifted, maybe due to conjugation. If it's ester, conjugation with the aromatic ring could lower the carbonyl frequency. For example, in benzaldehyde, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm−1. So if benzene is conjugated with an ester, lowering the carbonyl frequency here to 1720 would make sense. So that aligns.

Alternatively, could this be an amide? Amides have lower carbonyl (~1650), so no. Then ketones? Maybe, but where's the ketone here? Doesn't seem to fit. Aldehydes have higher carbonyl but it would have a peak around 280 for the aldehyde proton which is not here.

So more likely is the ester. Hence, OCH2CH3.

Now, the last NMR signal is 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). The idea of NH2 makes sense here, as they can be exchange broadened. Their shift at ~4.0 is a bit upfield, for example, in para-aminobenzoic acid ester, perhaps?

Let's check references. For example, in the case of ethyl para-aminobenzoate (which is a known compound, sometimes called Benzocaine when it's ethyl ester of para-aminobenzoic acid, used as a local anesthetic). Let me recall Benzocaine has the structure I proposed.

Checking Benzocaine: Molecular formula is C9H11NO2, exactly matches. Its structure is NH2–C6H4–COOCH2CH3. The IR would have an ester carbonyl (around 1720), and NH2 stretches. The NMR would have the ethyl group (triplet at ~1.2, quartet at ~4.2), but maybe varies a bit. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, as the substituents are in para positions (NH2 and COOEt). And in the NMR, the NH2 protons might get exchanged and show a broad peak around 4.0 ppm (if not exchanged, but in some conditions could be). However, in some cases the NH2 in Benzocaine may appear as a broad peak ~4.0-5.0 ppm. Let me check on actual data. 

Looking up Benzocaine NMR: Typically, NH2 group in Benzocaine, since it's an arylamine, in DMSO or CDCl3, may have exchange. But maybe here in the given NMR data, the NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. Alternatively, in some solvents or if it's protonated, shifts can change. Alternatively, maybe the amine is acetylated, but that would require a shift. Wait, but the molecular formula says one N, and two O. The esters have two O (COO); amine (NH2). So no, if it were acetanilide or something, N would be different.

Therefore, the likely candidate is Benzocaine, which is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Double-check: 

The H-NMR:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): CH2CH3, triplet (splitting by adjacent CH2).

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 of ethyl ester. Quartet due to splitting from CH3.

- Aromatic protons: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. For para substitution. In Benzocaine, the protons ortho to the ester (more deshielded) would be downfield, perhaps around 8.0 ppm (d, J=9 Hz) and the ones ortho to NH2 would be upfield around 7.0 ppm.

- The NH2 group: if not exchanging, perhaps as a singlet, but in reality, these protons are often broad and may integrate for 2H. Depending on solvent and concentration, they may appear as a broad peak. Indeed, at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), this fits the NH2 protons.

Another possible check: The IR shows NH2 stretches (3420, 3325 cm-1) confirms the NH2 group. The absence of a broad O-H stretch (which would be in carboxylic acid) supports the ester.

Therefore, this is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as Benzocaine.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to identify a compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 using the given IR and 1H NMR data. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step. 

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Plugging in the numbers: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2, X=0. So, that's (2*9 + 2 - 11 - 0 + 1)/2 = (18 + 2 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So, 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean 1 ring plus 3 double bonds, or 2 rings and 2 double bonds, etc. Or some combination with triple bonds, though the IR might indicate.

Looking at the IR data: the medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Typically, primary amines have two peaks around that range (asymmetric and symmetric stretches), but since they are of medium to strong intensity, maybe they are from an amide?

Also, another strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, likely a carbonyl (C=O). The 1720 is typical for an ester (RCOOR) or perhaps a ketone or aldehyde. But esters usually have carbonyl around 1725-1740, maybe a little higher. However, conjugation can lower the wavenumber. Alternatively, an acid (but IR of acid would have a very broad O-H stretch around 3000-2500, which isn't mentioned here). So maybe an ester, given that there's no broad O-H, but I need to check other functional groups. Alternatively, amides have carbonyl around 1650, so not this. 

So possible carbonyl groups here: ester, ketone, maybe an aldehyde, but no aldehyde proton peak in NMR. So maybe ester. Then, in the NMR... wait, let's look at the NMR data.

1H NMR: 

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – triplet, integrating for 3H. Likely a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. Maybe a CH2CH3 group. So ethyl group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, integrating for 2H. Broad singlet suggests exchange, maybe NH2 or OH. But the IR suggested possibly NH2. Could this be an NH2 group? But how does that fit... However, the 4.0 ppm is in the range where maybe protons adjacent to an electronegative atom are found. Let me remember that. For amines, the NH protons are usually in the 1-5 ppm range but usually broader. Wait but the signal here is a broad singlet at 4.0 with 2H. If it's exchangeable protons, but how to distinguish between NH2 and OH? The IR peaks were at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are in the range for N-H stretches (for a primary amine), whereas O-H stretches (like alcohol or carboxylic acid) are broader and maybe lower (carboxylic acid is very broad). However, the IR didn't mention a strong or broad O-H peak, which for an alcohol would be around 3200-3600, maybe a sharp peak if it's not exchanging.

However, NH2 protons in amines are usually around 1-3 ppm, except in aromatic amines (like aniline), which can be upfield shifted, but also may be split into multiple peaks unless in a symmetrical environment. But perhaps the broad singlet is for NH2 in primary amine. However, how does this tie into the molecule?

# Anthropic completion

I need to analyze a compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 using IR and 1H NMR data, so I'll examine this systematically.

Beginning with the molecular formula C9H11NO2, I'll calculate the degree of unsaturation using the formula (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. With C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2, and X=0, I get (2×9 + 2 - 11 - 0 + 1)/2 = (18 + 2 - 11 + 1)/2 = 10/2 = 5 degrees of unsaturation. This could represent 1 ring plus 3 double bonds, 2 rings plus 2 double bonds, or other combinations potentially including triple bonds.

Examining the IR data, I notice medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which likely represent N-H stretches. The presence of two peaks in this range typically indicates primary amines with asymmetric and symmetric stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from an ester, ketone, or possibly an aldehyde. The wavenumber is consistent with esters (typically 1725-1740 cm-1), though conjugation could lower this value. It's probably not an amide (carbonyl ~1650 cm-1) or carboxylic acid (which would show a broad O-H stretch around 3000-2500 cm-1 not mentioned here).

Moving to the 1H NMR data:

The triplet at 1.20 ppm integrating for 3H suggests a methyl group adjacent to a CH2, possibly part of an ethyl group (CH2CH3).

The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm integrating for 2H indicates exchangeable protons, potentially from NH2 or OH. Given the IR data showing two peaks around 3400 cm-1 (characteristic of N-H stretches) and no broad O-H peak mentioned, this 4.0 ppm signal likely represents NH2 protons. While amine NH2 protons typically appear at 1-3 ppm, those in aromatic amines can shift, which might explain the 4.0 ppm position. The broadness of the signal supports exchangeable protons like those in an amine group.

Let's now examine the next NMR peak to continue the analysis...

# OpenAI completion

To identify a compound with the molecular formula C9H11NO2 using the provided IR and 1H NMR data, let's analyze the information step-by-step.

First, the given molecular formula is C9H11NO2. To understand the structure, I'll calculate the degree of unsaturation using the formula (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Given the values, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2, X=0, the calculation becomes (2*9 + 2 - 11 - 0 + 1)/2 = (18 + 2 - 11 + 1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. This means there are 5 degrees of unsaturation, indicating possibilities like one ring and three double bonds, two rings and two double bonds, or combinations involving triple bonds, which might be suggested by the IR data.

Examining the IR data, there are medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which likely correspond to N-H stretches. Primary amines often display two peaks in this range due to asymmetric and symmetric stretches. However, since these are medium to strong, they might originate from an amide, though amide N-H is typically at lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, these could represent an amine, particularly a primary amine, given the two close peaks. Aromatic amines can also show similar patterns. Another notable IR feature is a strong band at 1720 cm-1, likely indicative of a carbonyl (C=O) group. While 1720 is typical for an ester (RCOOR), it could also suggest a ketone or aldehyde. Esters often have carbonyl absorption around 1725-1740, potentially influenced by conjugation, which can lower the wavenumber. Due to the absence of the broad O-H stretch typical of acids around 3000-2500, an acid is unlikely. Amides normally have carbonyl peaks around 1650, so this is improbable here. Hence, the possible carbonyl groups could be an ester, ketone, or maybe an aldehyde, but the absence of an aldehyde proton peak in the NMR suggests it might be an ester.

Now, let's examine the NMR data:

1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – This triplet, integrating for 3H, is likely a methyl group adjacent to a CH2, suggesting an ethyl group. 

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – This broad singlet integrating for 2H suggests exchangeable protons, possibly NH2 or OH. Given the IR data indicating possible NH2, this might be consistent with an NH2 group. The 4.0 ppm range aligns with protons adjacent to an electronegative atom. Amines typically have NH protons between 1-5 ppm, often presenting as broad signals. Here, the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm might indicate NH2 protons. Differentiating between NH2 and OH can be challenging; however, the IR peaks at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 correspond to N-H stretches typical for a primary amine. In contrast, O-H stretches (from alcohols or carboxylic acids) are broader and often at lower frequencies (carboxylic acids are very broad). Since the IR lacks mention of a strong or broad O-H peak around 3200-3600 cm-1, a primary amine NH2 seems more plausible. Additionally, NH2 protons in amines appear around 1-3 ppm, except in aromatic amines like aniline, where they might shift upfield. Although such protons might be split in less symmetrical environments, the broad singlet suggests an NH2 in a primary amine.

Next, let's look at the following NMR peak...

So like OCH2CH3, which is an ethoxy group, but the shift here is 4.5 ppm, which is higher than typical for an ethoxy (around 3.3-3.7 ppm). Unless it's part of an ester. Let's see, in an ester group, an ethyl ester would be OCH2CH3. The OCH2 typically resonates around 4.0-4.3 ppm, maybe. Wait, or if the oxygen is further conjugated, maybe. Alternatively, if it's part of an ethyl group attached to something else, like NH maybe? Alternatively, maybe the quartet and triplet are a -OCH2CH3 group. But let's check shift. For example, methyl esters are around 3.7 ppm for the OCH3. For ethyl esters, the CH2O would be around 4.2 ppm (quartet) and the CH3 around 1.2 ppm (triplet). Which fits with the 4.5 ppm? Maybe a little higher. Wait if it in a more deshielded environment, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the protons are adjacent to a carbonyl, so like an ethyl ester. If the 4.5 ppm is the OCH2CH3 group, then that could explain the quartet (coupled to the triplet CH3). But then combining that with the 1.20 triplet… let me consider. \n\nThen, the remaining NMR peaks: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These look like a pair of doublets, each integrating for 2H. This is typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. In a para-disubstituted benzene, you often get two doublets with coupling between the protons. For example, substituents that are strong deshielders in the para positions would cause the ring protons to split. The coupled protons would be at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let’s think: what groups would cause that? If the substituents are, say, an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) para to another EWG. For example, nitro groups, carbonyl, etc. Let's consider substituents such as NO2, COOR (ester), etc. \n\nSo putting this together, maybe the structure has a para-substituted benzene ring with two groups. Let's say one of the substituents is an ester (since the IR has a strong band at 1720) and maybe an amine group. Alternatively, another substituent. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (like acetyloxy or another group) and another is a nitro group. Wait, but the molecular formula includes one N. Wait, molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If there's an ester group (COOR), that would account for one O. The other O could be another oxygen in an ether, but the molecule has two oxygens. Let me count: COOR would be two oxygens (COO-). So if that is present, that's two oxygens, then the nitrogen would be in another group. The formula has one N, which could be in an amino group (-NH2) or an amide, but if amide, the carbonyl would be at lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, could the nitrogen be in a nitro group? Wait, nitro group is -NO2, which would be two oxygens. But in the given molecular formula, we already have two oxygens. So if the other oxygen is in a nitro group, that would require three oxygens. However, the formula is C9H11NO2. So only two oxygens. Therefore, the N cannot be in a nitro group. So the N must be in another group, likely a primary amine (-NH2) or an amide or something like that. But IR has those N-H stretch bands. Let's check.\n\nIf there is a para-substituted benzene ring with an ester group (COOEt, ethyl ester) and an NH2 group. Let's see. Benzene ring with COOEt and NH2 substituents in para positions.\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n\nCOOEt would contribute: O2. NH2 contributes N. The benzene ring is C6, then COOEt is C3 (COOEt: C1 (from COO) + C2 (ethyl)). Wait, COOEt is C3: the carbonyl carbon, then two from the ethyl. But integration:\n\nWait, molecular formula is C9H11NO2.\n\nSo benzene (6C), COOEt (3C: COOR, R is ethyl (2C)); but wait, if COOEt is OEt (O-C2H5), then ester would have two carbons from the ethyl. So 6 (benzene) + 1 (CO) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 1 (NH2?) Wait, but perhaps the NH2 is a substituent on the benzene. Let's count again:\n\nCarbons: Benzene (6C), COOEt (COO- would come from a -COOR group which adds (COOR: COO is O2, R is ethyl, so the carbonyl and the ethyl would contribute two carbons (the ethyl group: CH2CH3, which is two carbons)). Wait, but the carbonyl is part of the benzene ring, so:\n\nActually, if the structure is phenyl something. Let's suppose p-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Let's count.\n\nP-aminobenzoic acid would have a COOH and NH2 on the benzene in para. Esterification of the COOH to COOEt.\n\nSo structure would be Ph-COOEt-NH2 (para). Wait, that is:\n\nStructure is ethyl p-aminobenzoate.\n\nLet me check that formula. Benzene (6C), COOEt (COO requires two O, ester = COOR. Phenyl group (C6), COOEt adds 3 carbons (COO-R: R is ethyl, 2C), plus the NH2 which is -NH2 (no additional C). Wait, but 6 carbons from benzene, 1 (C from COO-) and 2 (from ethyl), total 6+1+2=9. Also, there's an NH2. The molecular formula would be C6H5-COOCH2CH3 + NH2. Wait, actually, in the para-aminobenzoate ethyl ester, the structure is:\n\nO\n|| \nO-C-OCH2CH3\n|\nC6H4 (para)\n|\nNH2\n\nSo the formula would be: C6 (benzene) + COO (which brings one more C) + OCH2CH3 (2C from ethyl) + NH2. So total carbons: 6 + 1 + 2 =9. Nitrogens: 1 (from NH2). Oxygens: 2 (in ester: COO and the O in ethyl). So that is C9H11NO2. Let's check Hs. Each aromatic C has one H (assuming p-disubstituted). Then the COOEt would have the ethyl group: ethyl ester is OCH2CH3. So ethyl has five H (but wait, depends on substitution). The benzene ring is disubstituted in para positions, so each substituent would be in para. Let's draw the structure:\n\nPh group: para-substituted with COOEt and NH2. The benzene ring has four H's (two doublets, each two H, so 4H total). Then, the ethyl ester would have -OCH2CH3: the ethyl group has 5 H. Wait:\n\nEthyl group (OCH2CH3): the CH2 would be adjacent to the oxygen, so split into a quartet by the neighboring CH3, which is triplet. Each quartet (2H) at 4.5 ppm and triplet (3H) at 1.2 ppm. Then, the NH2 group. If it's attached to the benzene ring (para to the ester), then the NH2 protons would be on the benzene. But NH2 in aromatic amines tends to be de-shielded. However, according to the NMR data, the NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (but chemical shifts for NH2 can vary).\n\nWait, but in aniline (benzene with NH2), the NH2 protons are around 3-4 ppm as a broad peak due to exchange. However, conjugation to the ring can affect that. So here, the 4.0 ppm broad singlet could be the NH2 group. But in aromatic amines, the NH2 protons are usually split into multiple peaks if ortho and para positions are substituted. But in para position, perhaps the NH2 is more symmetrical? Wait, no, even in p-substituted aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons can be broad singlets because of rapid proton exchange, especially in DMSO or if acidic. But perhaps the deuterated solvent is CDCl3, so if the NH2 is not too acidic, the splitting is observed, but maybe here, with a para substituent, the NH2 protons become broad singlet. Hmmm. Let me consider another angle.\n\nThe presence of both an ester (from the IR) and an amino group (from the IR and NMR). Then, para-substituted benzene (two doublets in aromatic region): so the substituents could be COOEt and NH2. Then the ethyl ester is OCH2CH3, which would have CH2 at ~4.1 ppm for OCH2, but here it's at 4.5 quartet. However, ethyl ester's OCH2 is typically around 4.1 ppm. But perhaps the shift is upfield or downfield due to neighboring substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is on the ethyl group. But if the structure is something like ethyl amino benzoate, then the amine would be on the ethyl group. Wait, like ethyl (something) aminobenzoate? Let me think.\n\nWait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me consider all possibilities. Phenyl group with COOEt (add 3 C, so C=6+3=9? Wait, no:\n\nWait phenyl group (C6) + COOEt (OOCR where R = ethyl, COOEt would have 3 carbons? No: COOR is (COO-R), so the COO contributes one carbon (the carbonyl carbon) and R (ethyl) contributes two. So total 1+2=3. So benzene (6C) + 3 C from COOEt + another substituent: If the substituent is NH2, which has no carbon, then total C6+3=云, but the formula is C9. Wait, COOEt would be giving 3 carbons (carbonyl, CH2CH3) but being attached to benzene. Wait let's look more carefully.\n\nLet me write out the structure.\n\nIf the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:\n\nStructure: Benzoic acid, where the carboxylic acid is esterified to ethyl, and the amine is para to the ester.\n\nFormula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is C8H9NO2. Wait, original formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2; as the ethyl ester, it would be C8H8O2. Then adding an NH2 group (replacing a H on the benzene), the formula becomes C8H9NO2. But the problem states the formula is C9H11NO2. So one more C and two more H. Hmm. That's inconsistent. Therefore, it must be another structure.\n\nWait, maybe the ethyl group is not on the ester? Alternatively, maybe there's an additional ethyl elsewhere. Let me recount.\n\nGiven the molecular formula C9H11NO2:\n\nPossible structures: let's see.\n\nIf it's benzocaine, which is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Wait: wait, maybe. Wait, let me calculate again. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's the ethyl ester, the formula would be C7H5O2 (from benzoate) + C2H5O (from ethyl ester), but wait no. Wait, the molecular formula of benzoic acid is C7H6O2 (C6H5COOH). When esterified with ethanol, it becomes C6H5COOCH2CH3. So the formula is C6 (Ph) + C2 (COO) + C2 (CH2CH3) = C9? Wait: COO is one C (the carbonyl carbon). Wait:\n\nPh-COOCH2CH3: Ph is C6, COO has one C (the carbonyl C), and the OCH2CH3 (ethyl group) has two carbons. So total C6 +1+2= C9. The formula is C9H10O2. Now adding an amino group (-NH2) in the para position (to the ester). So replacing one H with NH2. So the formula becomes C9H9NO2. But the problem's formula is C9H11NO2. So two more H. Therefore, maybe another CH2 group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent on the benzene is a ethylamino group. For example, if the benzene has a COOEt group and a NHCH2CH3 group. Then the formula would be:\n\nC6 (Ph) + COOEt (C3O2) + NHCH2CH3 (C2H5N). Total carbons: 6 +3 +2 = 11? But waits:\n\nWait, sorry, Ph is C6, COOEt is 3 carbons (COO from the acid becomes OCO, with R= ethyl, adding 2 carbons. But the original benzoic acid has Ph-COOH. So ester would be Ph-COOCH2CH3, which is 6 + 1 (carbonyl) + 2 (ethyl) = 9 carbons. But if there's an NHCH2CH3 group (N-ethylamino) on the benzene ring in para position, that would add 2 more carbons (the ethyl on the amine). Wait, N-ethyl substituent. Then the formula would be:\n\nPh group (6C) + COOEt (3C) + NHCH2CH3 (2C) → 6 + 3 + 2 =11 C. But target is 9 C. So that can’t be. Therefore, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the amine is part of a different group. Wait, how about the OCH2CH3 comes from an ethyl ester, and there's an ethyl amine? But then where would the ethyl amine be attached. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps a methyl group. Let me verify the molecular formula again.\n\nLet me compute the molecular formula step by step:\n\nThe given formula is C9H11NO2. Degree of unsaturation is 5. Which can be, for example, one ring (benzene, 3 DoU) + two double bonds or other groups.\n\nGiven the NMR, the aromatic protons (2 doublets, para substitution) indicate a benzene ring (4H integration in total for p-disubstituted).\n\nSo having the benzene ring (DoU=4 from ring and substituents?), plus another group.\n\nThe presence of an ester carbonyl (1720 cm-1). Then the ethyl groups from the ester suggests CH2CH3 (integrate 3H, triplet) and OCH2. But the OCH2 chemical shift is higher (4.5 ppm), which could be because it's adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl is part of an ethyl ester and something else.\n\nWait, let me think of another possible structure. Perhaps it's phenylacetate or another similar compound. Let me check p-aminophenyl acetate? Phenyl acetate is OAc-O-Ph. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a propyl group but that complicates it.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. But IR's carbonyl would then be lower. Wait, the carbonyl here is at 1720, which is more consistent with ester or ketone.\n\nAlternatively, if the molecule is a nitro compound, but then O would count towards the two O's. Suppose that nitro group is present. Wait, but nitro groups consume two O's. Then how?\n\nNitrogen can be part of an amide or amine.\n\nWait, maybe its a hybrid of an acylamino group.\n\nWait, let me try assembling the fragments.\n\nThe NMR shows:\n\n- A triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), so likely a CH2CH3 group.\n\n- A quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), adjacent to the CH2CH3, so could be OCH2CH3.\n\n- A broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), likely NH2 or OH. Considering the IR, which shows NH stretches, that is probably NH2.\n\nThen, two aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. That probably is a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) would be adjacent to an electron-donating group, and the downfield (8.0 ppm) adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. So one substituent could be EWG (e.g., ester) and another EDG (e.g., amino).\n\nEthyl p-aminobenzoate fits into that. The substituents would be -NH2 (EDG) and -COOEt (EWG). The aromatic protons adjacent to the amino group would be upfield (around 7.0 ppm), and those adjacent to the ester would be downfield (8.0 ppm). But in ethyl p-aminobenzoate, the ester is at para to the amino group, so the adjacent protons would be two ortho to the ester and two ortho to the amino. But due to the para substitution, each H is next to one substituent: two H ortho to COOEt (more deshielded, hence downfield to 8.0 ppm), two H ortho to NH2 (more shielded, upfield 7.0 ppm). The coupling between the two pairs would give rise to doublets.\n\nNow the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check how. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Esterification with ethanol replaces the -OH with -OCH2CH3, giving C7H6O2 - H2O (from COOH to COOCH2CH3) + C2H5O? Wait no, the formula for ethyl benzoate would be C6H5COOCH2CH3. So: C6 (Ph) + C (carbonyl) + O2 + C2 (ethyl). So total carbons are 6 + 1 + 2 =9; hydrogens: for Ph (5H), COOCH2CH3: the ethyl group has 5H (but actually, ethyl ester OCH2CH3 is 2H in OCH2 and 3H in CH3); so the total H? Ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Adding an amino group (NH2) in para position would replace one H: thus H goes from 10 in ethyl benzoate to 9 in ethyl p-aminobenzoate, but the given formula has 11 H. Wait, no.\n\nWait need to recount ethyl p-aminobenzoate.\n\nC6H4 (since benzene has 6 C, but p-disubstituted, which replaces two H). But actually, ethyl p-aminobenzoate is:\n\nStructure: NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The formula would be: C6H4 (4H, as two H are replaced by substituents) + NH2 (N and 2H) + COOCH2CH3 (COO has one C, ethyl has 2C). So total carbons: 6 (from C6H4) + 1 (COO) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 0 from NH2 = 9 C. Correct. Nitrogens: 1 (from NH2).\n\nHydrogens: original benzene would have 4H left (since two substituents: NH2 and COOEt). Then ethyl group: OCH2CH3 has 2+3=5H. Also, NH2 has 2H. So total H: 4 (benzene) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) = 11 H. Oxygens: 2 (from COO). Therefore, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which matches exactly. So this must be the structure: ethyl p-aminobenzoate.\n\nThen matching the spectra:\n\nIn the NMR:\n\nThe triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) corresponds to the ethyl CH3, adjacent to the OCH2. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is the OCH2 of the ester. The NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. The aromatic protons are two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, corresponding to the NH2 (upfield) and the ester (downfield) substituents. \n\nThe IR: the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is the ester carbonyl. The N-H stretches in the IR (3420 and 3325 cm-1) from the NH2 group. Since the amino group is in para position to the ester, this fits.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as benzocaine. Benzocaine is a local anesthetic, common compound with that structure.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe compound is \\boxed{Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743811780, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5268, prompt_tokens=1043, total_tokens=6311, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

: 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – quartet integrating for 2H. A quartet (q) adjacent to a triplet (since it's quartlet, probably split by the triplet). So if we had a CH2CH3 group (from the triplet at 1.20), then the quartet would be the adjacent CH2. So like OCH2CH3, which is an ethoxy group, but the shift here is 4.5 ppm, which is higher than typical for an ethoxy (around 3.3-3.7 ppm). Unless it's part of an ester. Let's see, in an ester group, an ethyl ester would be OCH2CH3. The OCH2 typically resonates around 4.0-4.3 ppm, maybe. Wait, or if the oxygen is further conjugated, maybe. Alternatively, if it's part of an ethyl group attached to something else, like NH maybe? Alternatively, maybe the quartet and triplet are a -OCH2CH3 group. But let's check shift. For example, methyl esters are around 3.7 ppm for the OCH3. For ethyl esters, the CH2O would be around 4.2 ppm (quartet) and the CH3 around 1.2 ppm (triplet). Which fits with the 4.5 ppm? Maybe a little higher. Wait if it in a more deshielded environment, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the protons are adjacent to a carbonyl, so like an ethyl ester. If the 4.5 ppm is the OCH2CH3 group, then that could explain the quartet (coupled to the triplet CH3). But then combining that with the 1.20 triplet… let me consider. 

Then, the remaining NMR peaks: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These look like a pair of doublets, each integrating for 2H. This is typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. In a para-disubstituted benzene, you often get two doublets with coupling between the protons. For example, substituents that are strong deshielders in the para positions would cause the ring protons to split. The coupled protons would be at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. Let’s think: what groups would cause that? If the substituents are, say, an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) para to another EWG. For example, nitro groups, carbonyl, etc. Let's consider substituents such as NO2, COOR (ester), etc. 

So putting this together, maybe the structure has a para-substituted benzene ring with two groups. Let's say one of the substituents is an ester (since the IR has a strong band at 1720) and maybe an amine group. Alternatively, another substituent. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (like acetyloxy or another group) and another is a nitro group. Wait, but the molecular formula includes one N. Wait, molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If there's an ester group (COOR), that would account for one O. The other O could be another oxygen in an ether, but the molecule has two oxygens. Let me count: COOR would be two oxygens (COO-). So if that is present, that's two oxygens, then the nitrogen would be in another group. The formula has one N, which could be in an amino group (-NH2) or an amide, but if amide, the carbonyl would be at lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, could the nitrogen be in a nitro group? Wait, nitro group is -NO2, which would be two oxygens. But in the given molecular formula, we already have two oxygens. So if the other oxygen is in a nitro group, that would require three oxygens. However, the formula is C9H11NO2. So only two oxygens. Therefore, the N cannot be in a nitro group. So the N must be in another group, likely a primary amine (-NH2) or an amide or something like that. But IR has those N-H stretch bands. Let's check.

If there is a para-substituted benzene ring with an ester group (COOEt, ethyl ester) and an NH2 group. Let's see. Benzene ring with COOEt and NH2 substituents in para positions.

Let's count the atoms:

COOEt would contribute: O2. NH2 contributes N. The benzene ring is C6, then COOEt is C3 (COOEt: C1 (from COO) + C2 (ethyl)). Wait, COOEt is C3: the carbonyl carbon, then two from the ethyl. But integration:

Wait, molecular formula is C9H11NO2.

So benzene (6C), COOEt (3C: COOR, R is ethyl (2C)); but wait, if COOEt is OEt (O-C2H5), then ester would have two carbons from the ethyl. So 6 (benzene) + 1 (CO) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 1 (NH2?) Wait, but perhaps the NH2 is a substituent on the benzene. Let's count again:

Carbons: Benzene (6C), COOEt (COO- would come from a -COOR group which adds (COOR: COO is O2, R is ethyl, so the carbonyl and the ethyl would contribute two carbons (the ethyl group: CH2CH3, which is two carbons)). Wait, but the carbonyl is part of the benzene ring, so:

Actually, if the structure is phenyl something. Let's suppose p-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Let's count.

P-aminobenzoic acid would have a COOH and NH2 on the benzene in para. Esterification of the COOH to COOEt.

So structure would be Ph-COOEt-NH2 (para). Wait, that is:

Structure is ethyl p-aminobenzoate.

Let me check that formula. Benzene (6C), COOEt (COO requires two O, ester = COOR. Phenyl group (C6), COOEt adds 3 carbons (COO-R: R is ethyl, 2C), plus the NH2 which is -NH2 (no additional C). Wait, but 6 carbons from benzene, 1 (C from COO-) and 2 (from ethyl), total 6+1+2=9. Also, there's an NH2. The molecular formula would be C6H5-COOCH2CH3 + NH2. Wait, actually, in the para-aminobenzoate ethyl ester, the structure is:

O
|| 
O-C-OCH2CH3
|
C6H4 (para)
|
NH2

So the formula would be: C6 (benzene) + COO (which brings one more C) + OCH2CH3 (2C from ethyl) + NH2. So total carbons: 6 + 1 + 2 =9. Nitrogens: 1 (from NH2). Oxygens: 2 (in ester: COO and the O in ethyl). So that is C9H11NO2. Let's check Hs. Each aromatic C has one H (assuming p-disubstituted). Then the COOEt would have the ethyl group: ethyl ester is OCH2CH3. So ethyl has five H (but wait, depends on substitution). The benzene ring is disubstituted in para positions, so each substituent would be in para. Let's draw the structure:

Ph group: para-substituted with COOEt and NH2. The benzene ring has four H's (two doublets, each two H, so 4H total). Then, the ethyl ester would have -OCH2CH3: the ethyl group has 5 H. Wait:

Ethyl group (OCH2CH3): the CH2 would be adjacent to the oxygen, so split into a quartet by the neighboring CH3, which is triplet. Each quartet (2H) at 4.5 ppm and triplet (3H) at 1.2 ppm. Then, the NH2 group. If it's attached to the benzene ring (para to the ester), then the NH2 protons would be on the benzene. But NH2 in aromatic amines tends to be de-shielded. However, according to the NMR data, the NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (but chemical shifts for NH2 can vary).

Wait, but in aniline (benzene with NH2), the NH2 protons are around 3-4 ppm as a broad peak due to exchange. However, conjugation to the ring can affect that. So here, the 4.0 ppm broad singlet could be the NH2 group. But in aromatic amines, the NH2 protons are usually split into multiple peaks if ortho and para positions are substituted. But in para position, perhaps the NH2 is more symmetrical? Wait, no, even in p-substituted aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons can be broad singlets because of rapid proton exchange, especially in DMSO or if acidic. But perhaps the deuterated solvent is CDCl3, so if the NH2 is not too acidic, the splitting is observed, but maybe here, with a para substituent, the NH2 protons become broad singlet. Hmmm. Let me consider another angle.

The presence of both an ester (from the IR) and an amino group (from the IR and NMR). Then, para-substituted benzene (two doublets in aromatic region): so the substituents could be COOEt and NH2. Then the ethyl ester is OCH2CH3, which would have CH2 at ~4.1 ppm for OCH2, but here it's at 4.5 quartet. However, ethyl ester's OCH2 is typically around 4.1 ppm. But perhaps the shift is upfield or downfield due to neighboring substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is on the ethyl group. But if the structure is something like ethyl amino benzoate, then the amine would be on the ethyl group. Wait, like ethyl (something) aminobenzoate? Let me think.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me consider all possibilities. Phenyl group with COOEt (add 3 C, so C=6+3=9? Wait, no:

Wait phenyl group (C6) + COOEt (OOCR where R = ethyl, COOEt would have 3 carbons? No: COOR is (COO-R), so the COO contributes one carbon (the carbonyl carbon) and R (ethyl) contributes two. So total 1+2=3. So benzene (6C) + 3 C from COOEt + another substituent: If the substituent is NH2, which has no carbon, then total C6+3=云, but the formula is C9. Wait, COOEt would be giving 3 carbons (carbonyl, CH2CH3) but being attached to benzene. Wait let's look more carefully.

Let me write out the structure.

If the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:

Structure: Benzoic acid, where the carboxylic acid is esterified to ethyl, and the amine is para to the ester.

Formula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is C8H9NO2. Wait, original formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2; as the ethyl ester, it would be C8H8O2. Then adding an NH2 group (replacing a H on the benzene), the formula becomes C8H9NO2. But the problem states the formula is C9H11NO2. So one more C and two more H. Hmm. That's inconsistent. Therefore, it must be another structure.

Wait, maybe the ethyl group is not on the ester? Alternatively, maybe there's an additional ethyl elsewhere. Let me recount.

Given the molecular formula C9H11NO2:

Possible structures: let's see.

If it's benzocaine, which is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Wait: wait, maybe. Wait, let me calculate again. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's the ethyl ester, the formula would be C7H5O2 (from benzoate) + C2H5O (from ethyl ester), but wait no. Wait, the molecular formula of benzoic acid is C7H6O2 (C6H5COOH). When esterified with ethanol, it becomes C6H5COOCH2CH3. So the formula is C6 (Ph) + C2 (COO) + C2 (CH2CH3) = C9? Wait: COO is one C (the carbonyl carbon). Wait:

Ph-COOCH2CH3: Ph is C6, COO has one C (the carbonyl C), and the OCH2CH3 (ethyl group) has two carbons. So total C6 +1+2= C9. The formula is C9H10O2. Now adding an amino group (-NH2) in the para position (to the ester). So replacing one H with NH2. So the formula becomes C9H9NO2. But the problem's formula is C9H11NO2. So two more H. Therefore, maybe another CH2 group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent on the benzene is a ethylamino group. For example, if the benzene has a COOEt group and a NHCH2CH3 group. Then the formula would be:

C6 (Ph) + COOEt (C3O2) + NHCH2CH3 (C2H5N). Total carbons: 6 +3 +2 = 11? But waits:

Wait, sorry, Ph is C6, COOEt is 3 carbons (COO from the acid becomes OCO, with R= ethyl, adding 2 carbons. But the original benzoic acid has Ph-COOH. So ester would be Ph-COOCH2CH3, which is 6 + 1 (carbonyl) + 2 (ethyl) = 9 carbons. But if there's an NHCH2CH3 group (N-ethylamino) on the benzene ring in para position, that would add 2 more carbons (the ethyl on the amine). Wait, N-ethyl substituent. Then the formula would be:

Ph group (6C) + COOEt (3C) + NHCH2CH3 (2C) → 6 + 3 + 2 =11 C. But target is 9 C. So that can’t be. Therefore, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the amine is part of a different group. Wait, how about the OCH2CH3 comes from an ethyl ester, and there's an ethyl amine? But then where would the ethyl amine be attached. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps a methyl group. Let me verify the molecular formula again.

Let me compute the molecular formula step by step:

The given formula is C9H11NO2. Degree of unsaturation is 5. Which can be, for example, one ring (benzene, 3 DoU) + two double bonds or other groups.

Given the NMR, the aromatic protons (2 doublets, para substitution) indicate a benzene ring (4H integration in total for p-disubstituted).

So having the benzene ring (DoU=4 from ring and substituents?), plus another group.

The presence of an ester carbonyl (1720 cm-1). Then the ethyl groups from the ester suggests CH2CH3 (integrate 3H, triplet) and OCH2. But the OCH2 chemical shift is higher (4.5 ppm), which could be because it's adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl is part of an ethyl ester and something else.

Wait, let me think of another possible structure. Perhaps it's phenylacetate or another similar compound. Let me check p-aminophenyl acetate? Phenyl acetate is OAc-O-Ph. But that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe a propyl group but that complicates it.

Alternatively, let's consider that maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. But IR's carbonyl would then be lower. Wait, the carbonyl here is at 1720, which is more consistent with ester or ketone.

Alternatively, if the molecule is a nitro compound, but then O would count towards the two O's. Suppose that nitro group is present. Wait, but nitro groups consume two O's. Then how?

Nitrogen can be part of an amide or amine.

Wait, maybe its a hybrid of an acylamino group.

Wait, let me try assembling the fragments.

The NMR shows:

- A triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), so likely a CH2CH3 group.

- A quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), adjacent to the CH2CH3, so could be OCH2CH3.

- A broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), likely NH2 or OH. Considering the IR, which shows NH stretches, that is probably NH2.

Then, two aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. That probably is a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents. The upfield doublet (7.0 ppm) would be adjacent to an electron-donating group, and the downfield (8.0 ppm) adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. So one substituent could be EWG (e.g., ester) and another EDG (e.g., amino).

Ethyl p-aminobenzoate fits into that. The substituents would be -NH2 (EDG) and -COOEt (EWG). The aromatic protons adjacent to the amino group would be upfield (around 7.0 ppm), and those adjacent to the ester would be downfield (8.0 ppm). But in ethyl p-aminobenzoate, the ester is at para to the amino group, so the adjacent protons would be two ortho to the ester and two ortho to the amino. But due to the para substitution, each H is next to one substituent: two H ortho to COOEt (more deshielded, hence downfield to 8.0 ppm), two H ortho to NH2 (more shielded, upfield 7.0 ppm). The coupling between the two pairs would give rise to doublets.

Now the molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check how. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Esterification with ethanol replaces the -OH with -OCH2CH3, giving C7H6O2 - H2O (from COOH to COOCH2CH3) + C2H5O? Wait no, the formula for ethyl benzoate would be C6H5COOCH2CH3. So: C6 (Ph) + C (carbonyl) + O2 + C2 (ethyl). So total carbons are 6 + 1 + 2 =9; hydrogens: for Ph (5H), COOCH2CH3: the ethyl group has 5H (but actually, ethyl ester OCH2CH3 is 2H in OCH2 and 3H in CH3); so the total H? Ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Adding an amino group (NH2) in para position would replace one H: thus H goes from 10 in ethyl benzoate to 9 in ethyl p-aminobenzoate, but the given formula has 11 H. Wait, no.

Wait need to recount ethyl p-aminobenzoate.

C6H4 (since benzene has 6 C, but p-disubstituted, which replaces two H). But actually, ethyl p-aminobenzoate is:

Structure: NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The formula would be: C6H4 (4H, as two H are replaced by substituents) + NH2 (N and 2H) + COOCH2CH3 (COO has one C, ethyl has 2C). So total carbons: 6 (from C6H4) + 1 (COO) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 0 from NH2 = 9 C. Correct. Nitrogens: 1 (from NH2).

Hydrogens: original benzene would have 4H left (since two substituents: NH2 and COOEt). Then ethyl group: OCH2CH3 has 2+3=5H. Also, NH2 has 2H. So total H: 4 (benzene) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) = 11 H. Oxygens: 2 (from COO). Therefore, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which matches exactly. So this must be the structure: ethyl p-aminobenzoate.

Then matching the spectra:

In the NMR:

The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) corresponds to the ethyl CH3, adjacent to the OCH2. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is the OCH2 of the ester. The NH2 is a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. The aromatic protons are two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, corresponding to the NH2 (upfield) and the ester (downfield) substituents. 

The IR: the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is the ester carbonyl. The N-H stretches in the IR (3420 and 3325 cm-1) from the NH2 group. Since the amino group is in para position to the ester, this fits.

Therefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as benzocaine. Benzocaine is a local anesthetic, common compound with that structure.

**Final Answer**
The compound is \boxed{Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate}.

A quartet suggests it's adjacent to a CH2. If there's a methyl group (triplet at 1.20 ppm) and a neighboring quartet (likely from an ethyl group split by the methyl), this together implies an ethyl group that's part of an ester moiety (-OCH2CH3 or similar), but the ethyl group in esters are usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm (as for methoxy groups, but ethyl may be downfield if adjacent to something else). The quartet at 4.5 ppm would align with a methylene (CH2) next to an oxygen, perhaps as part of an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), but 4.5 seems slightly upfield for that. Alternatively, the quartet could be part of an ethyl group attached to a nitrogen. For example, in an ethylamine or amide structure.\n\nWait, the molecular formula includes NO2, which could be a nitro group or part of a different functional group. Alternatively, N and O could be in an amide or an ester. The carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and the amine protons (NMR and IR) suggest perhaps something like an N-substituted acetamide with an ester group? Not sure yet.\n\nThen, we have aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (2H, doublet) and 8.0 ppm (2H, doublet). These likely form a para-substituted benzene ring. A pair of doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm with two protons each suggests substituents in the para positions. For instance, in para-substituted benzene rings, substituents can create such splitting. The upfield (lower ppm) protons are likely meta to an electron-donating group, and the downfield (higher ppm) to an electron-withdrawing group, perhaps. For example, a nitro group meta to some group would deshield the adjacent protons. However, the NH2 group attached to the ring could have an effect. Alternatively, this could be acetophenone-related.\n\nPutting together, let us think of possible structures. Let me consider substituents on the benzene ring. Suppose we have a benzene ring with a nitro group (NO2) and another group. Wait, but considering the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. So, 9 carbons. A benzene ring (C6H5), so the remaining would be three carbons, one N, and two O's ? Let me see.\n\nSuppose the compound has a benzene ring connected to an ethyl group (C2) and an O-containing group. For example, benzocaine is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzocaine has the structure O=C(OCH2CH3)(NHC6H5). Wait, the structure is:\n\nNH2─C6H4─COO─CH2CH3\n\nSo, let's check the molecular formula. C7 (from benzoate) + C2 (ethyl) = C9. The amino group (NH2), COO (2 O's), so overall:\n\nC9H11NO2. Let me count:\n\nBenzene ring (6C), COO (2O, each attached to:\nCOO-Ethyl: COOCH2CH3 (which gives 2C in ethyl +1C in COO, but the benzoic acid's COO brings total O as two (assuming the ester group has two O's). Wait. Anyway, structure is NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The formula would be:\n\nC6 (benzene) + COOCH2CH3 (C3O2) plus NH2 (N):\n\nTotal: C6 +C3 + 0 (from NH2) = C9. O2, N1. Then hydrogens. Benzene (has 5H when substituted with two groups? Let me be precise. For para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester:\n\nNH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3:\n\nThe benzene ring would be 1,4-substituted (para). For each substituent: NH2 (at position 4), COOEt (position 1). The ring would have 4 H's. But the NH2 group is in the amine form. Wait, the actual hydrogen count:\n\nBenzene ring: when there are two substituents in para positions (positions 1 and 4), each substituent takes one H away. So six H minus two substituents ⇒ 4 H. However, phenyl groups usually lose more Hs according to substitution.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the way to count. Let's look at the overall compound.\n\nBenzoic acid ester: C6H5COOCH2CH3. The molecular formula for that would be:\n\nC6 (Ph) + C (from COO) + 2C (ethyl) → C9 (total C). O2 from COOCH2CH3 (specifically, O in COO is two). Nitrogen? There's no N in benzoic acid ester, but in benzocaine there is an NH2 group. So actually, NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. Let's calculate molecular formula.\n\nC6 (from benzene ring) plus COOCH2CH3 → C(COOCH2CH3) = 3C (1 from COO, and 2 from ethyl). Plus NH2 group (no C). So total C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) = 9. Correct.\n\nThen N is 1 (NH2). O is 2 (from COO, plus nitro?)\n\nWait, here in the problem, the molecular formula includes NO2? Or is it N and O2?\n\nNo, wait the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check:\n\nNH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3: benzene (C6H5─), then the COOCH2CH3 group (CH3CH2OOC-), connected at the para position to NH2.\n\nSo the entire molecule is NH2─Ph─COOCH2CH3. Let's check:\n\nPh is C6H5; so combining phenyl (C6H5), COOCH2CH3 (which is OOC-O-CH2CH3). Wait, the structure would be O=C(OCH2CH3)-Ph-NH2 where the OCH2CH3 group and NH2 are para.\n\nLet's tally the atoms:\n\nCarbon: 6 (Ph) + 1 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 9C. Nitrogen: 1 (NH2). Oxygen: 2 (from ester O). Hydrogen: For benzene, Ph group if substituted with two groups (NH2 and COOEt): but original benzene (C6H6) leads to substitutions. Let's see:\n\nNH2 is one substituent, COOEt as another (at para positions). Each substitution takes a H. So Ph would have 6 - 2 = 4 H, but the substituents each bring their own H. COOEt would be OCH2CH3 (two H on CH2, three on CH3). NH2 has two H. Let's sum:\n\nPh: 4 H from the ring.\n\nCOOEt: OCH2CH3 has 2 H (from OCH2) plus 3 H (from CH3) → 5 H.\n\nNH2: 2 H.\n\nAdditionally, the ethyl group (CH2CH3) has 5 H (methylene here?) Wait, the COOEt group: the structure is phenyl-OCO-OCH2CH3. Wait no, actually, the ester is phenyl-O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, correct structure is:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-OCH2CH3\n|\nPh-NH2 (para)\n\nWait, but in benzocaine, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the benzoic acid with COOEt group and NH2 para. That structure’s formula would be:\n\nNH2-C6H4-CO-OCH2CH3. That's 6 (C in benzene) + 2 (CO2) from the benzoate part, but wait:\n\nBenzoic acid is C7H6O2. As the ethyl ester, add two carbons (CH2CH3) to make the ester (replacing the -OH with -OCH2CH3), giving C9 (6 benzene + 3 from COO and ethyl). The overall formula: C9H11O2N. Wait, let me actually calculate:\n\nBenzoic acid: C7H6O2 → to make the ethyl ester, C7H6O2 changes to C7H5O2 (loses -OH) + OCH2CH3 (which has 2 carbons and gives the ester O, but oxygen count would be O2 from COO, because O in ester is a part of COO. Therefore, the formula for ethyl benzoate would be C9H10O2 (C7H5O2 + C2H5O → but rearrange for accuracy). Alternatively, perhaps my confusion here suggests a better approach: build the formula incrementally.\n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:\n\n- The benzene ring (C6)\n- The COO group (including the carbonyl O and the ester oxygen: so two O's here)\n- The ethyl group (C2)\n- The amino group (NH2: contributing 1 N)\n\nHydrogen count:\n\n- Benzene ring: after substitution with NH2 and COOEt groups at para positions, the remaining H on the ring would be 4 (but perhaps I should add later).\n- The amino group: 2 H\n- The ethyl group (OCH2CH3): 2 in OCH2, 3 in CH3 → 5 H\n- The methylene (CH2) from the ethyl?\n\nBut maybe overall, let's compile:\n\nPh group (C6H5-) becomes C6H4 when two substituents are attached (para). Then COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So attaching that:\n\nPh-(CO-O-CH2CH3)-NH2 (para). Then:\n\nCarbon count: C6 (Ph) + 1 (from COO) + 2 (from ethyl) = 9C. Nitrogen: 1 (from NH2). Oxygen: 3? Because (from COO: two O's, and one from the ester, which connects to the ethyl) → Wait, no. The ester group is -O-CO-O-? No. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', so requires three O's? No, the ester functional group is RCOOR'—so in that case, O is part of the carbonyl (COO). For example, RCOOR' has two oxygen atoms (double-bonded O in COO). Wait, no: RCOOR' would have two O atoms: one in the carbonyl and one in the ether linkage. So that's two oxygen atoms. So in the formula of ethyl benzoate, it's C9H10O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, replacing -OH with -OCH2CH3 adds (OCH2CH3 = O, 2 C, and 5 H, but subtracts an OH (–H and –OH's O?)), hence maybe.)\n\nBut perhaps I should just total the atoms:\n\nPh group (C6H5), with substituents. Let me calculate for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:\n\nC9H11NO2.\n\nEach carbon:\n\n- 1 (COO group)\n- 6 (benzene)\n- 2 (ethyl)\nTotal 9 → Correct.\n\nNitrogen: 1 in NH2 → Correct.\n\nOxygen: Two (in COO) → yes, matches the formula.\n\nHydrogen: Let's count each part.\n\nBenzene ring with two substituents: as a benzene ring (C6H6) gives up two H for substitution. Therefore, H = 6 - 2 = 4 H remaining on the ring.\n\nAmino group NH2: 2 H.\n\nEster group OCH2CH3: ethyl group has 5 H.\n\nCarbonyl COO doesn't add any H (only O). But the connection into the benzene:\n\nThe NH2 is -NH2 attached to benzene (so replaces one H), the COOEt group (as OCOOEt..? Wait, no—ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be:\n\nO\n||\n(Ph-NH2)-C-O-OCH2CH3\n\nSo the entire molecule: the benzene with NH2 attached to position 4, and COOEt attached to position 1. The COOEt group brings a carbonyl (C=O) and an ester oxygen. So should we now count Hs:\n\nBenzene ring: starting at C6H6. Remove two H (for NH2 and COOEt substituents) so brcomes C6H4. Then the substituents:\n\nNH2 gives two Hs.\n\nThe COOEt group is O Then (after apostrophe let's see):\n\nThe COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3. The COO group, where O=C-O minus which connects to ethyl.\n\nIn this structure, how many Hs? The ethyl's (OCH2CH3) part has 2 H (of OCH2) and 3 H (CH3) leading to 5 H, the benzal ring has 4 H, the NH2 has 2 H. Summing up 4 + 2 +5 = 11 H. But the formula is C9H11NO2. Yes, correct! Therefore, 4 (ring) + 2 (NH2) + 5 (ester) = 11 H. So this matches.\n\nLooking at the NMR for this compound:\n\nThe NMR data given:\n\n1.20 ppm, triplet (3H) → likely the methyl (CH3) of the ethyl group, which would be split by the adjacent OCH2. In an ethyl ester, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. The methyl (CH3) would couple with the adjacent OCH2's two H, resulting in a triplet. The chemical shift at ~1.2 ppm matches a methyl adjacent to oxygen (generally ~1.3 ppm for ethyl ester's CH3). So that's assigned to the CH3 of OCH2CH3.\n\n4.5 ppm, quartet (2H) → corresponds to the OCH2 part of the ethyl ester. In esters, the CH2 adjacent to oxygen often appears as a quartet around 4.1–4.3 ppm. But if there's some deshielding, perhaps from an electron-withdrawing group nearby, it might be shifted upfield to 4.5 ppm? Let me check. Wait in ethanol, CH3CH2-O-..., the OCH2CH3 in ethyl ester is typically ~4.1 as a quartet. If in NMR this is at 4.5 ppm, perhaps due to being next to a carbonyl. Or maybe my standard shifts are off.\n\nThen, aromatic protons:\n\n7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H). In para-substituted benzene with two groups, this would split the aromatic protons into two doublets. In benzocaine, NH2 and COOEt groups are para. The NH2 is electron-donating (via conjugation?), so the adjacent ring protons would be deshielded. Wait—usually, the amino group is strong activating, para to the ester which is deactivating. Let me think. The ester group (COOEt) is meta-directing and deactivating, while the NH2 is para-directing and activating. The NH2 group might increase electron density, shielding the adjacent protons, causing a upfield shift. Actually, the positions ortho and para to the electron-donating groups (like NH2) can be deshielded, leading to a downfield shift. Wait, I think I need to reconsider the NMR shifts.\n\nBenzene ring with electron-withdrawing groups (like COOEt) deplete electron density and deshield the adjacent protons, causing higher ppm (downfield). The NH2 group is electron-donating (activating), the o and p positions may have upfield shifts. So, in benzocaine (para aminobenzoate), the ester group (COOEt) at position 1, and NH2 at position 4. The remaining aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOEt, meta to NH2) and positions 3 and 5 (ortho to NH2, meta to COOEt).\n\nTherefore, the protons ortho to COOEst (a deactivating group) would be deshielded and downfield (higher ppm), whereas protons ortho to NH2 (activating group) would be upfield. The observed NMR shows two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.\n\nIn benzocaine (ethyl para-aminobenzoate), the protons adjacent to the COOEt (positions 2 and 6) are ortho to the electron-withdrawing group, hence downfield, while the protons ortho to the NH2 (positions 3 and 5) are upfield. But according to the NMR, we have a doublet at 7.0 ppm (2H) and another at 8.0ppm (2H). Let's assume positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to COOE, downfield) would absorb at higher ppm. So perhaps 8.0 ppm is their shift and 7.0 ppm is the other pair. That would match para-substituted benzene with two nonequivalent substituents.\n\nNext, the NH2 group. Its protons are observed as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm integrating to 2H. However, primary amines typically resonate around 1-3 ppm, but in aromatic amines such as aniline, the NH2 resonance is upfield-shifted due to conjugation. However, in acetaminophen (para-aminophenol derivative), the NH2 is often observed at around 4-5 ppm as a broad singlet due to exchange broadening (which accounts for the broadness here). Wait no, primary aromatic amines can have NH2 protons around δ 3-6 ppm, and if there's hydrogen bonding or electron-withdrawing groups nearby, they can deshire that. However, in solution, they are usually sharpiening if not. In some cases, NH2 in aniline derivatives show broad singlets. Given that this NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, this could correspond to the NH2 group.\n\nWait obtaining conflicting info here. Another possibility: but what if the NH2 group is part of an amide? Wait, but amide protons would show up further downfield (around 6-8 ppm if it's an NH in an amide), but the IR here shows amine bands (3420, 3325 cm-1), not amide.\n\nBut alternatively, maybe the protons absorbed in 4.0 ppm are two exchangeable protons, like NH2 as in the amine group.\n\nAnother point is integration: total integration is: 3H (CH3), 2H (maybe NH2), 2H (OCH2), and 4 aromatic H (2 doublets of 2 each). Summing to 3+2+2+4 = 11 H, which matches C9H11NO2.\n\nAnother possible structure: perhaps phenacetin (similar to acetaminophen but ethoxy instead of hydroxy). Phenacetin is C10H13NO2, which is not the formula given here, C9H11NO2. So that's a different molecular formula.\n\nAlternatively, looking back. Let me check if there's a nitro group (NO2) in the compound given the formula. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Here, the O gives O2. If there's a nitro group, the oxygen count could be two (as in NO2), but we have already accounted for oxygen in the ester. Though the formula may not add up if nitro is present. Let me check:\n\nIf structure is nitrobenzene derivative with ester:\n\nNitro group (NO2): contributes 2 oxygen, but we need another H that O. But the given formula has O2, so if there's a nitro group, the remaining O must come from another functional group. Previously, the ester needs 2 O (COO), so concomitant presence of nitro would need more O. But Given molecular formula has O2, which wouldn't allow NO2 and COO both. So that's impossible. Therefore, it's better to think that there's no nitro group. Thus, N is from NH2, an amine.\n\nReturning to benzocaine (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), all data seems to fit:\n\nIR: Medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 → these are N-H stretches in primary amine (NH2 symmetric and asymmetric).

NH2 symmetric and asymmetric stretches in amines are around 3300-3500 cm-1, yes, so the IR matches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is consistent with the ester carbonyl stretch.\n\nNMR:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ester's ethyl CH3 (gives triplet from coupling with CH2).\n\n4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2CH3's CH2, quartet.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 wait, the peak at 4.5 ppm is a quartet (q) integrating for 2H. A quartet suggests it's adjacent to a CH2. If there's a methyl group (triplet at 1.20 ppm) and a neighboring quartet (likely from an ethyl group split by the methyl), this together implies an ethyl group that's part of an ester moiety (-OCH2CH3 or similar), but the ethyl group in esters are usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm (as for methoxy groups, but ethyl may be downfield if adjacent to something else). The quartet at 4.5 ppm would align with a methylene (CH2) next to an oxygen, perhaps as part of an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), but 4.5 seems slightly upfield for that. Alternatively, the quartet could be part of an ethyl group attached to a nitrogen. For example, in an ethylamine or amide structure.

Wait, the molecular formula includes NO2, which could be a nitro group or part of a different functional group. Alternatively, N and O could be in an amide or an ester. The carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and the amine protons (NMR and IR) suggest perhaps something like an N-substituted acetamide with an ester group? Not sure yet.

Then, we have aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (2H, doublet) and 8.0 ppm (2H, doublet). These likely form a para-substituted benzene ring. A pair of doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm with two protons each suggests substituents in the para positions. For instance, in para-substituted benzene rings, substituents can create such splitting. The upfield (lower ppm) protons are likely meta to an electron-donating group, and the downfield (higher ppm) to an electron-withdrawing group, perhaps. For example, a nitro group meta to some group would deshield the adjacent protons. However, the NH2 group attached to the ring could have an effect. Alternatively, this could be acetophenone-related.

Putting together, let us think of possible structures. Let me consider substituents on the benzene ring. Suppose we have a benzene ring with a nitro group (NO2) and another group. Wait, but considering the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. So, 9 carbons. A benzene ring (C6H5), so the remaining would be three carbons, one N, and two O's ? Let me see.

Suppose the compound has a benzene ring connected to an ethyl group (C2) and an O-containing group. For example, benzocaine is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzocaine has the structure O=C(OCH2CH3)(NHC6H5). Wait, the structure is:

NH2─C6H4─COO─CH2CH3

So, let's check the molecular formula. C7 (from benzoate) + C2 (ethyl) = C9. The amino group (NH2), COO (2 O's), so overall:

C9H11NO2. Let me count:

Benzene ring (6C), COO (2O, each attached to:
COO-Ethyl: COOCH2CH3 (which gives 2C in ethyl +1C in COO, but the benzoic acid's COO brings total O as two (assuming the ester group has two O's). Wait. Anyway, structure is NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The formula would be:

C6 (benzene) + COOCH2CH3 (C3O2) plus NH2 (N):

Total: C6 +C3 + 0 (from NH2) = C9. O2, N1. Then hydrogens. Benzene (has 5H when substituted with two groups? Let me be precise. For para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester:

NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3:

The benzene ring would be 1,4-substituted (para). For each substituent: NH2 (at position 4), COOEt (position 1). The ring would have 4 H's. But the NH2 group is in the amine form. Wait, the actual hydrogen count:

Benzene ring: when there are two substituents in para positions (positions 1 and 4), each substituent takes one H away. So six H minus two substituents ⇒ 4 H. However, phenyl groups usually lose more Hs according to substitution.

Wait, maybe that's not the way to count. Let's look at the overall compound.

Benzoic acid ester: C6H5COOCH2CH3. The molecular formula for that would be:

C6 (Ph) + C (from COO) + 2C (ethyl) → C9 (total C). O2 from COOCH2CH3 (specifically, O in COO is two). Nitrogen? There's no N in benzoic acid ester, but in benzocaine there is an NH2 group. So actually, NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. Let's calculate molecular formula.

C6 (from benzene ring) plus COOCH2CH3 → C(COOCH2CH3) = 3C (1 from COO, and 2 from ethyl). Plus NH2 group (no C). So total C: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) = 9. Correct.

Then N is 1 (NH2). O is 2 (from COO, plus nitro?)

Wait, here in the problem, the molecular formula includes NO2? Or is it N and O2?

No, wait the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check:

NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3: benzene (C6H5─), then the COOCH2CH3 group (CH3CH2OOC-), connected at the para position to NH2.

So the entire molecule is NH2─Ph─COOCH2CH3. Let's check:

Ph is C6H5; so combining phenyl (C6H5), COOCH2CH3 (which is OOC-O-CH2CH3). Wait, the structure would be O=C(OCH2CH3)-Ph-NH2 where the OCH2CH3 group and NH2 are para.

Let's tally the atoms:

Carbon: 6 (Ph) + 1 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 9C. Nitrogen: 1 (NH2). Oxygen: 2 (from ester O). Hydrogen: For benzene, Ph group if substituted with two groups (NH2 and COOEt): but original benzene (C6H6) leads to substitutions. Let's see:

NH2 is one substituent, COOEt as another (at para positions). Each substitution takes a H. So Ph would have 6 - 2 = 4 H, but the substituents each bring their own H. COOEt would be OCH2CH3 (two H on CH2, three on CH3). NH2 has two H. Let's sum:

Ph: 4 H from the ring.

COOEt: OCH2CH3 has 2 H (from OCH2) plus 3 H (from CH3) → 5 H.

NH2: 2 H.

Additionally, the ethyl group (CH2CH3) has 5 H (methylene here?) Wait, the COOEt group: the structure is phenyl-OCO-OCH2CH3. Wait no, actually, the ester is phenyl-O-CO-OCH2CH3. Wait, correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH2CH3
|
Ph-NH2 (para)

Wait, but in benzocaine, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the benzoic acid with COOEt group and NH2 para. That structure’s formula would be:

NH2-C6H4-CO-OCH2CH3. That's 6 (C in benzene) + 2 (CO2) from the benzoate part, but wait:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. As the ethyl ester, add two carbons (CH2CH3) to make the ester (replacing the -OH with -OCH2CH3), giving C9 (6 benzene + 3 from COO and ethyl). The overall formula: C9H11O2N. Wait, let me actually calculate:

Benzoic acid: C7H6O2 → to make the ethyl ester, C7H6O2 changes to C7H5O2 (loses -OH) + OCH2CH3 (which has 2 carbons and gives the ester O, but oxygen count would be O2 from COO, because O in ester is a part of COO. Therefore, the formula for ethyl benzoate would be C9H10O2 (C7H5O2 + C2H5O → but rearrange for accuracy). Alternatively, perhaps my confusion here suggests a better approach: build the formula incrementally.

In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:

- The benzene ring (C6)
- The COO group (including the carbonyl O and the ester oxygen: so two O's here)
- The ethyl group (C2)
- The amino group (NH2: contributing 1 N)

Hydrogen count:

- Benzene ring: after substitution with NH2 and COOEt groups at para positions, the remaining H on the ring would be 4 (but perhaps I should add later).
- The amino group: 2 H
- The ethyl group (OCH2CH3): 2 in OCH2, 3 in CH3 → 5 H
- The methylene (CH2) from the ethyl?

But maybe overall, let's compile:

Ph group (C6H5-) becomes C6H4 when two substituents are attached (para). Then COOEt is O-CO-OCH2CH3. So attaching that:

Ph-(CO-O-CH2CH3)-NH2 (para). Then:

Carbon count: C6 (Ph) + 1 (from COO) + 2 (from ethyl) = 9C. Nitrogen: 1 (from NH2). Oxygen: 3? Because (from COO: two O's, and one from the ester, which connects to the ethyl) → Wait, no. The ester group is -O-CO-O-? No. Wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', so requires three O's? No, the ester functional group is RCOOR'—so in that case, O is part of the carbonyl (COO). For example, RCOOR' has two oxygen atoms (double-bonded O in COO). Wait, no: RCOOR' would have two O atoms: one in the carbonyl and one in the ether linkage. So that's two oxygen atoms. So in the formula of ethyl benzoate, it's C9H10O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, replacing -OH with -OCH2CH3 adds (OCH2CH3 = O, 2 C, and 5 H, but subtracts an OH (–H and –OH's O?)), hence maybe.)

But perhaps I should just total the atoms:

Ph group (C6H5), with substituents. Let me calculate for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:

C9H11NO2.

Each carbon:

- 1 (COO group)
- 6 (benzene)
- 2 (ethyl)
Total 9 → Correct.

Nitrogen: 1 in NH2 → Correct.

Oxygen: Two (in COO) → yes, matches the formula.

Hydrogen: Let's count each part.

Benzene ring with two substituents: as a benzene ring (C6H6) gives up two H for substitution. Therefore, H = 6 - 2 = 4 H remaining on the ring.

Amino group NH2: 2 H.

Ester group OCH2CH3: ethyl group has 5 H.

Carbonyl COO doesn't add any H (only O). But the connection into the benzene:

The NH2 is -NH2 attached to benzene (so replaces one H), the COOEt group (as OCOOEt..? Wait, no—ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be:

O
||
(Ph-NH2)-C-O-OCH2CH3

So the entire molecule: the benzene with NH2 attached to position 4, and COOEt attached to position 1. The COOEt group brings a carbonyl (C=O) and an ester oxygen. So should we now count Hs:

Benzene ring: starting at C6H6. Remove two H (for NH2 and COOEt substituents) so brcomes C6H4. Then the substituents:

NH2 gives two Hs.

The COOEt group is O Then (after apostrophe let's see):

The COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3. The COO group, where O=C-O minus which connects to ethyl.

In this structure, how many Hs? The ethyl's (OCH2CH3) part has 2 H (of OCH2) and 3 H (CH3) leading to 5 H, the benzal ring has 4 H, the NH2 has 2 H. Summing up 4 + 2 +5 = 11 H. But the formula is C9H11NO2. Yes, correct! Therefore, 4 (ring) + 2 (NH2) + 5 (ester) = 11 H. So this matches.

Looking at the NMR for this compound:

The NMR data given:

1.20 ppm, triplet (3H) → likely the methyl (CH3) of the ethyl group, which would be split by the adjacent OCH2. In an ethyl ester, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. The methyl (CH3) would couple with the adjacent OCH2's two H, resulting in a triplet. The chemical shift at ~1.2 ppm matches a methyl adjacent to oxygen (generally ~1.3 ppm for ethyl ester's CH3). So that's assigned to the CH3 of OCH2CH3.

4.5 ppm, quartet (2H) → corresponds to the OCH2 part of the ethyl ester. In esters, the CH2 adjacent to oxygen often appears as a quartet around 4.1–4.3 ppm. But if there's some deshielding, perhaps from an electron-withdrawing group nearby, it might be shifted upfield to 4.5 ppm? Let me check. Wait in ethanol, CH3CH2-O-..., the OCH2CH3 in ethyl ester is typically ~4.1 as a quartet. If in NMR this is at 4.5 ppm, perhaps due to being next to a carbonyl. Or maybe my standard shifts are off.

Then, aromatic protons:

7.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H). In para-substituted benzene with two groups, this would split the aromatic protons into two doublets. In benzocaine, NH2 and COOEt groups are para. The NH2 is electron-donating (via conjugation?), so the adjacent ring protons would be deshielded. Wait—usually, the amino group is strong activating, para to the ester which is deactivating. Let me think. The ester group (COOEt) is meta-directing and deactivating, while the NH2 is para-directing and activating. The NH2 group might increase electron density, shielding the adjacent protons, causing a upfield shift. Actually, the positions ortho and para to the electron-donating groups (like NH2) can be deshielded, leading to a downfield shift. Wait, I think I need to reconsider the NMR shifts.

Benzene ring with electron-withdrawing groups (like COOEt) deplete electron density and deshield the adjacent protons, causing higher ppm (downfield). The NH2 group is electron-donating (activating), the o and p positions may have upfield shifts. So, in benzocaine (para aminobenzoate), the ester group (COOEt) at position 1, and NH2 at position 4. The remaining aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOEt, meta to NH2) and positions 3 and 5 (ortho to NH2, meta to COOEt).

Therefore, the protons ortho to COOEst (a deactivating group) would be deshielded and downfield (higher ppm), whereas protons ortho to NH2 (activating group) would be upfield. The observed NMR shows two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.

In benzocaine (ethyl para-aminobenzoate), the protons adjacent to the COOEt (positions 2 and 6) are ortho to the electron-withdrawing group, hence downfield, while the protons ortho to the NH2 (positions 3 and 5) are upfield. But according to the NMR, we have a doublet at 7.0 ppm (2H) and another at 8.0ppm (2H). Let's assume positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to COOE, downfield) would absorb at higher ppm. So perhaps 8.0 ppm is their shift and 7.0 ppm is the other pair. That would match para-substituted benzene with two nonequivalent substituents.

Next, the NH2 group. Its protons are observed as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm integrating to 2H. However, primary amines typically resonate around 1-3 ppm, but in aromatic amines such as aniline, the NH2 resonance is upfield-shifted due to conjugation. However, in acetaminophen (para-aminophenol derivative), the NH2 is often observed at around 4-5 ppm as a broad singlet due to exchange broadening (which accounts for the broadness here). Wait no, primary aromatic amines can have NH2 protons around δ 3-6 ppm, and if there's hydrogen bonding or electron-withdrawing groups nearby, they can deshire that. However, in solution, they are usually sharpiening if not. In some cases, NH2 in aniline derivatives show broad singlets. Given that this NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, this could correspond to the NH2 group.

Wait obtaining conflicting info here. Another possibility: but what if the NH2 group is part of an amide? Wait, but amide protons would show up further downfield (around 6-8 ppm if it's an NH in an amide), but the IR here shows amine bands (3420, 3325 cm-1), not amide.

But alternatively, maybe the protons absorbed in 4.0 ppm are two exchangeable protons, like NH2 as in the amine group.

Another point is integration: total integration is: 3H (CH3), 2H (maybe NH2), 2H (OCH2), and 4 aromatic H (2 doublets of 2 each). Summing to 3+2+2+4 = 11 H, which matches C9H11NO2.

Another possible structure: perhaps phenacetin (similar to acetaminophen but ethoxy instead of hydroxy). Phenacetin is C10H13NO2, which is not the formula given here, C9H11NO2. So that's a different molecular formula.

Alternatively, looking back. Let me check if there's a nitro group (NO2) in the compound given the formula. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Here, the O gives O2. If there's a nitro group, the oxygen count could be two (as in NO2), but we have already accounted for oxygen in the ester. Though the formula may not add up if nitro is present. Let me check:

If structure is nitrobenzene derivative with ester:

Nitro group (NO2): contributes 2 oxygen, but we need another H that O. But the given formula has O2, so if there's a nitro group, the remaining O must come from another functional group. Previously, the ester needs 2 O (COO), so concomitant presence of nitro would need more O. But Given molecular formula has O2, which wouldn't allow NO2 and COO both. So that's impossible. Therefore, it's better to think that there's no nitro group. Thus, N is from NH2, an amine.

Returning to benzocaine (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), all data seems to fit:

IR: Medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 → these are N-H stretches in primary amine (NH2 symmetric and asymmetric). Amines show such bands, which match NH2. But I would need to check if primary amines indeed appear here. NH2 symmetric and asymmetric stretches in amines are around 3300-3500 cm-1, yes, so the IR matches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is consistent with the ester carbonyl stretch.

NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ester's ethyl CH3 (gives triplet from coupling with CH2).

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2CH3's CH2, quartet.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2. Broad singlet as exchanging protons. However, where is that located spatially? If the NH2 is on the same benzene ring at para position to the ester group. The amine protons could be deshielded due to conjugation and be uptfield at 4.0 ppm.

Aromatic protons: if 4-aminobenzoate ester, the aromatic protons are ortho to each substituent. The substituent positions affect their chemical shifts. The protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester group (positions 2 and 6) would be downfield (about 8.0 ppm), and the protons adjacent to the electron-donating NH2 group (positions 3 and 5) would be upfield (7.0 ppm).

In the NMR, we observe at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This corresponds to para substituents with two sets of two protons each, coupling as doublets due to the adjacent protons. The downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) corresponds to the protons ortho to the electrwd group (COOEt), upfield (7.0 ppm) adjacent to NH2.

This supports the proposed structure ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is benzocaine.

Alternative structures if anything: Let's think if it's aliphatic.

Wait, but the protons at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are clearly aromatic. So aliphatic parts would not account for this. Therefore, existence of aromatic ring must be present.

Another possible structure is phenylalanine ethyl ester? Let me check. Phenylalanine's structure is NH2-CH(CH2Ph)-COOH. The ethyl ester would require additional O, but molecular formula adjustment. But given the O and N counts in the given compound; the formula here i's C9H11NO2. Phenylalanine ethyl ester would be C9H11NO2 (PhCH2CH(NH2)COOEt?), but calculating atoms:

Ph (6C) + CH2CH(NH2)COOEt: that would be 1 (CH2) + 1 (CH(NH2)) + 2 (COOEt) → total of 6+1+1+2=10 C. Not matching.

Alternatively, but perhaps it's meta- aminobenzoate or ortho. But para substitution fits substituent effects.

Alternatively, acetophenone derivatives. For example, 4-aminoacetophenone ethyl ester. But pairing the data may not align. Still, let's dismiss this as the explanation matches better with benzocaine.

Given this reasoning, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine). Therefore, the answer is benzocaine. The molecular formula, IR and NMR all align with it.

Quartets are common when a –CH2– group is adjacent to a methyl group (splitting by three protons), and here coupled with the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH2CH3). Therefore, this quartet is likely the –CH2– in an ethyl group (CH2CH3). The chemical shift at 4.5 ppm suggests that the ethyl group is attached to an electronegative atom. For example, in an ethyl ester (RCOOCH2CH3), the CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen resonate around 4.0-4.3 ppm. A higher shift (4.5 ppm) could imply adjacent nitrogens. Alternatively, if the ethyl group is part of an amine, such as in an ethylamine (NH2CH2CH3), shifts can vary. However, the NH2 would typically absorb at lower ppm. The 4.5 ppm value is somewhat high for a normal CH2 next to oxygen. Another possibility is that the ethyl group is adjacent to oxygen in an ester (i.e., OCH2CH3), but the usual shift for ethoxy (R-O-CH2CH3) is around 1.2 (CH3) and 3.5-4.0 (CH2), so this quartet at 4.5 ppm seems high. Alternatively, the ethyl could be part of an acyl group, like an ethyl carbamate (NHCOOCH2CH3) or so. But more analysis is needed.\n\nAnother key point in the NMR is the two doublets at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These signals suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each pair of doublets with 2H each (probably indicating two doublets each integrating to two protons) points to a symmetrical substitution in the aromatic ring, perhaps at the para position. The difference in chemical shifts (7.0 and 8.0 ppm) suggests that the substituents are electron-withdrawing. For instance, nitro groups (meta directors) typically deshield aromatic protons, giving higher ppm shifts. However, in this case, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. In a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, such as ortho to each other, but that's less symmetric. Alternatively, a mono-substituted benzene would have a singlet unless there's another substituent altering the symmetry. Wait, doublets with each two protons suggest two substituents leading to two pairs of equivalent protons, such as in para-substituted benzene derivatives. Wait, no—para-substituted benzene with one group would give a pair of doublets (vicinal coupling) if there's a nitro group at the para position, but pairs here at 7.0 and 8.0 may indicate perhaps a nitro group para to an amino group. Wait, aromatic rings with two substituents. If there are two substituents, such as in para-nitroaniline, you might have symmetry. Let me consider that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the splitting is due to coupling with adjacent protons. For a para-disubstituted benzene, if the substituents are di-nitrogen like in para-aminobenzoic acid. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2—let's see. Para-substituted aromatic rings with substituents might fit. The NMR shows aromatic protons as two doublets. Let me recall: ortho coupling can lead to doublets for each set. If there are two sets of equivalent protons on a benzene ring, such as a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring with two different substituents, allowing two distinct pairs of equivalent protons. For example, in para-nitrobenzaldehyde, you might have two pairs, but the exact pattern would depend on the groups.\n\nHowever, looking back at our molecular formula, we have C9H11NO2. Now, considering that, perhaps an ethyl group, an amine group, and an ester group. Let’s aggregate information:\n\nWe have from IR: probable NH2 (from N-H stretches at 3420 and 3325 cm-1), a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1, likely ester), and an aromatic ring (evident from the NMR aromatic signals). The molecular formula is nine carbons. \n\nLet me consider possible structures. Para-aminobenzoic acid ester (like benzocaine). Benzocaine is ethyl para-aminobenzoate (C9H11NO2). Let me check benzocaine. The structure is NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. Molecular formula is C9H11NO2 (C7 for benzene ring with substituents + carbonyl + ethyl group: 7 benzene carbons substituted with NH2 and OOCH2CH3; total carbons: 7 (ring) + 2 (ester OCH2CH3) + carbonyl? Wait, COOEt is O-C-O-C2H5; so count: C6H5 (benzo) + COOEt would be: 6 (benze no substituents) + 1 (COO) + 2 (Et) = 9 (with substituents: in para positions on the benzene. Let me confirm:\n\nBenzoic acid is C6H5COOH. The ethyl ester would be C6H5COOCH2CH3. Then, adding the amino group on the benzene ring (para to the ester group), giving para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. The molecular formula would then be C9H11NO2 as needed. That structure has a benzene ring with two groups: NH2 and COOCH2CH3 in para positions. Let’s validate against NMR and IR.\n\nLet me analyze benzocaine:\n\nIR:\n\n- The NH2 groups from aromatic amine would show N-H stretches. Primary amines have two peaks due to asymmetric and symmetric stretching (approximately ~3420, 3325 cm-1 as given), which matches the IR here. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 would correspond to the carbonyl (C=O) of the ester functional group. This aligns nicely.\n\nNMR:\n\nFor benzocaine (ethyl para-aminobenzoate), the structure is NH2-(C6H4)-COOCH2CH3. Let's predict the expected NMR signals:\n\nThe ethyl group (OCH2CH3):\n\nThe CH3 group (OCH2CH3) would be a triplet (adjacent to CH2) integrating for 3H at around δ1.20 ppm (as given).\n\nThe OCH2 group (attached to oxygen in the ester) would typically resonate upfield. The splitting would be a quartet (split by the adjacent CH3). The chemical shift for OCH2CH3 is usually around δ4.1-4.3 ppm. However, the given NMR has a quartet at 4.5 ppm. Is that possible? Maybe there is some de-shielding, but perhaps in this context, the neighboring groups could shift it a bit. But perhaps this requires consideration. Alternatively, maybe there is an additional group adjacent. \n\nThe COOCH2CH3 group:\n\n- The ethoxy group (OCH2CH3): The CH2 attached to oxygen is expected as a quartet around δ4.0-4.3 ppm. If the NMR indicates a quartet at 4.5 ppm, maybe there's an adjacent nitrogens exerting an effect, but benzocaine’s ethoxy should be around δ4.1-4.3. Hmm. The observed shift in the data is 4.5 ppm, a bit higher than standard. However, in benzocaine, how does it work?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an ethyl group connected not to oxygen but to another group. Wait, let's check again.\n\nNH2-(phenyl)-COOCH2CH3:\n\nN-methyl group? No amino in the ethoxy.\n\nAlternatively, the NH2 in the para position would cause anisotropy, moving the ester OCH2CH3's chemical shift? Maybe. Alternatively, we may need to reevaluate.\n\nIn ethanol, the protons on the OCH2CH3 in an ester are typically around δ4.3 ppm for OCH2. For example, ethyl acetate has the OCH2 at ~4.12 (quartet) and CH3 at 1.23 (triplet). In benzocaine, the effect might be slightly shifted by the aromatic ring's proximity, but δ4.5 may still be justifiable.\n\nThe NMR also indicates a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. In benzocaine, the NH2 group (para to the ester) might have protons as broad signals. However, aromatic amines (aniline derivatives) typically have NH2 protons around δ3.5-5 ppm as broad signals due to possible hydrogen bonding or exchange. But in benzocaine, the NH2 group of the para-aminobenzoate is conjugated to the aromatic ring and may show a broad peak around δ5-7 ppm. Alternatively, because it's para to the ester, the conjugation might influence its chemical shift.\n\nWait, but in the given NMR data, the NH2 is at δ4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. Possibly, this could be a flexible argument accounting for its position and exchange broadening. Let me check literature values. For example, the NH2 protons in benzocaine appear as a broad peak around δ5.0-6.0, integrating for 2H and possibly split into a doublet if coupled with neighboring protons. The current data at δ4.0 ppm might instead suggest that it's not the aromatic NH2. Alternatively, could the NH2 be part of a different group? For example, in a urea or carbamate group. But then we would need additional analysis.\n\nWait, the formula for benzocaine (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) is C9H11NO2. Let’s check the exact structure:\n\nPhenyl ring (C6H5) with NH2 (at position 4) and COOEt (ester at position 1). Its molecule should then have:\n\nThe aromatic protons would be at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 (assuming 1 is COOEt, 4 is NH2). The NH2 group at para position to the ester. Then, the H at 2,6 and 3,5 positions would be equivalent each. If the substituent at 1 is COOEt (electron-withdrawing ester, which is meta-directing) and the substituent at 4 is NH2 (electron-donating, para to the ester).\n\nIn such a scenario, the positions of aromatic protons and their chemical shifts would depend on the substituents.\n\nIn para-aminobenzoic acid (free acid), the aromatic protons adjacent to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded compared to positions 3 and 5. Wait, no. The substituents’ effects are as follows: The ester group (COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group (due to conjugation), making the ring deactivating and meta-directing. The NH2 group (para to the ester) is electron-donating (activating, para to itself), so the NH2 is donating electrons via resonance, causing the adjacent positions (ortho to NH2) to be deshielded? Wait, orientation of substitution and neighboring effects can be complex.\n\nIn such dichlorobenzene analogs, in a para-substituted arrangement, the aromatic protons often show coupling patterns. For the given molecule, there is likely symmetry. If NH2 is at para to the ester group (positions 1 and 4), the adjacent hydrogen atoms would be at positions 2 and 6 (meta to COOEt) and 3 and 5 (meta to NH2).\n\nAlternatively, consideringthat the ester group deactivates the ring and the amino group donates electrons, the actual chemical shifts of the aromatic protons would vary. The H atoms adjacent to the COOEt group (ortho to it) would experience a more deshielded (downfield) shift, while those adjacent to the NH2 (ortho to NH2) would experience shielded (upfield) shifts due to electron-donating effect.\n\nBut in the given NMR, the aromatic protons are δ7.0 (d, 2H) and δ8.0 (d, 2H). In benzene rings with two substituents para to each other, lots depend on the substituents. If we have one substituent (COOEt) at position 1 and NH2 at position 4 (para), then all the aromatic protons (positions 2,3,5,6) would form a coupled system. But considering the substituents, each adjacent ring position is either ortho to COOEt or to NH2. Let's say positions 2: ortho to COOEt (positions 1 and 4's para).\n\nAlternatively, this analysis is getting a bit tangled; perhaps just to compare with literature data.\n\nIn ethyl para-aminobenzoate (benzocaine), the aromatic protons consist of two doublets. The protons adjacent to the NH2 (positions 2 and 6 of the benzene ring) should be more upfield due to electron donation, whereas those adjacent to the ester group (positions and another m-position) may be more downfield. \n\nLooking for benzocaine’s actual NMR data:\n\nIn reference, benzocaine typically shows two doublets in the aromatic region. According to SDBS (Spectral Database for Organic Compounds): \n\nBenzocaine 1H NMR (CDCl3):\n\n- δ1.38 (t, J=7.1 Hz, 3H) for the CH3 of the ethyl group.\n- δ4.33 (q, J=7.1 Hz, 2H) for the OCH2 of ester.\n- δ6.62 (d, J=8.8 Hz, 2H) for aromatic protons adjacent to NH2.\n- δ7.89 (d, J=8.8 Hz, 2H) for aromatic protons adjacent to COOEt.\n- The NH2 protons usually show as a broad peak around δ4.0-4.5 ppm in deuterated solvents. However, in practice, if the NH2 group is not exchanging (for example, in DMSO-d6), the protons can appear as a broad peak. However, in CDCl3, they may not be very apparent because they may exchange too quickly, leading to a broad hump rather than distinct peaks. Alternatively, the sample could have been protonated, making the NH2 into NH3+ (in acidic conditions), but this depends on the solvent.\n\nThe given NMR data includes:\n\n1.20 ppm (t,3H): which matches closely with the ethoxy CH3.\n4.5 ppm (q,2H): the OCH2. However, in standard benzocaine literature, ethyl's OCH2 is at higher ppm (~4.3).\n\nThe readout here has OCH2 at 4.5. Though slightly upshifted, likely due to the presence of NH2 deshielding it.\n\n4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): This could correspond to NH2 as per the IR. However, perhaps in this case, the data may have been taken in a solvent where NH2 is observable. Alternatively, maybe the actual structure is slightly different.\n\nThe aromatic protons in benzocaine are at δ6.62 (d) and δ7.89 (d), which is close to the user’s data (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm). The reported downfield shift (8.0 ppm) matches the protons adjacent to the ester group (since COOEt is electron-withdrawing). The upfield (7.0 ppm) protons are adjacent to the NH2 group. Thus, assignments align if the provided data corresponds to these values, albeit with possible slight variations based on the solvent or sample conditions.\n\nAnother matchup: the quartet at 4.5 ppm for OCH2 in the user’s data versus 4.33 for benzocaine. The slight upfield shift could be due to the -NH2 being conjugated in the ring, but I think it's close enough to be possible.\n\nSo, considering all these observations:\n\n- Molecular formula C9H11NO2 fits for benzocaine (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate).\n- IR shows N-H and C=O ester, aligning.\n- NMR has ethyl group (triplet and quartet), aromatic doublets, and a broad NH2.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the compound is benzocaine – ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\n**Confidence Level:** High confidence based on IR peaks (N-H, ester C=O), NMR match (ethyl group, aromatic doublets, NH2 singlet). However, if any discrepancies exist (for example, exact chemical shifts for OCH2), they are minor and could be explained by solvent or concentration differences. Therefore, the compound is most likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine).\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743812274, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4084, prompt_tokens=895, total_tokens=4979, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – A quartet integrating to 2H. Quartets are common when a –CH2– group is adjacent to a methyl group (splitting by three protons), and here coupled with the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH2CH3). Therefore, this quartet is likely the –CH2– in an ethyl group (CH2CH3). The chemical shift at 4.5 ppm suggests that the ethyl group is attached to an electronegative atom. For example, in an ethyl ester (RCOOCH2CH3), the CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen resonate around 4.0-4.3 ppm. A higher shift (4.5 ppm) could imply adjacent nitrogens. Alternatively, if the ethyl group is part of an amine, such as in an ethylamine (NH2CH2CH3), shifts can vary. However, the NH2 would typically absorb at lower ppm. The 4.5 ppm value is somewhat high for a normal CH2 next to oxygen. Another possibility is that the ethyl group is adjacent to oxygen in an ester (i.e., OCH2CH3), but the usual shift for ethoxy (R-O-CH2CH3) is around 1.2 (CH3) and 3.5-4.0 (CH2), so this quartet at 4.5 ppm seems high. Alternatively, the ethyl could be part of an acyl group, like an ethyl carbamate (NHCOOCH2CH3) or so. But more analysis is needed.

Another key point in the NMR is the two doublets at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These signals suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each pair of doublets with 2H each (probably indicating two doublets each integrating to two protons) points to a symmetrical substitution in the aromatic ring, perhaps at the para position. The difference in chemical shifts (7.0 and 8.0 ppm) suggests that the substituents are electron-withdrawing. For instance, nitro groups (meta directors) typically deshield aromatic protons, giving higher ppm shifts. However, in this case, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. In a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, such as ortho to each other, but that's less symmetric. Alternatively, a mono-substituted benzene would have a singlet unless there's another substituent altering the symmetry. Wait, doublets with each two protons suggest two substituents leading to two pairs of equivalent protons, such as in para-substituted benzene derivatives. Wait, no—para-substituted benzene with one group would give a pair of doublets (vicinal coupling) if there's a nitro group at the para position, but pairs here at 7.0 and 8.0 may indicate perhaps a nitro group para to an amino group. Wait, aromatic rings with two substituents. If there are two substituents, such as in para-nitroaniline, you might have symmetry. Let me consider that.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to coupling with adjacent protons. For a para-disubstituted benzene, if the substituents are di-nitrogen like in para-aminobenzoic acid. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2—let's see. Para-substituted aromatic rings with substituents might fit. The NMR shows aromatic protons as two doublets. Let me recall: ortho coupling can lead to doublets for each set. If there are two sets of equivalent protons on a benzene ring, such as a 1,4-disubstituted (para) ring with two different substituents, allowing two distinct pairs of equivalent protons. For example, in para-nitrobenzaldehyde, you might have two pairs, but the exact pattern would depend on the groups.

However, looking back at our molecular formula, we have C9H11NO2. Now, considering that, perhaps an ethyl group, an amine group, and an ester group. Let’s aggregate information:

We have from IR: probable NH2 (from N-H stretches at 3420 and 3325 cm-1), a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1, likely ester), and an aromatic ring (evident from the NMR aromatic signals). The molecular formula is nine carbons. 

Let me consider possible structures. Para-aminobenzoic acid ester (like benzocaine). Benzocaine is ethyl para-aminobenzoate (C9H11NO2). Let me check benzocaine. The structure is NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. Molecular formula is C9H11NO2 (C7 for benzene ring with substituents + carbonyl + ethyl group: 7 benzene carbons substituted with NH2 and OOCH2CH3; total carbons: 7 (ring) + 2 (ester OCH2CH3) + carbonyl? Wait, COOEt is O-C-O-C2H5; so count: C6H5 (benzo) + COOEt would be: 6 (benze no substituents) + 1 (COO) + 2 (Et) = 9 (with substituents: in para positions on the benzene. Let me confirm:

Benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. The ethyl ester would be C6H5COOCH2CH3. Then, adding the amino group on the benzene ring (para to the ester group), giving para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. The molecular formula would then be C9H11NO2 as needed. That structure has a benzene ring with two groups: NH2 and COOCH2CH3 in para positions. Let’s validate against NMR and IR.

Let me analyze benzocaine:

IR:

- The NH2 groups from aromatic amine would show N-H stretches. Primary amines have two peaks due to asymmetric and symmetric stretching (approximately ~3420, 3325 cm-1 as given), which matches the IR here. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 would correspond to the carbonyl (C=O) of the ester functional group. This aligns nicely.

NMR:

For benzocaine (ethyl para-aminobenzoate), the structure is NH2-(C6H4)-COOCH2CH3. Let's predict the expected NMR signals:

The ethyl group (OCH2CH3):

The CH3 group (OCH2CH3) would be a triplet (adjacent to CH2) integrating for 3H at around δ1.20 ppm (as given).

The OCH2 group (attached to oxygen in the ester) would typically resonate upfield. The splitting would be a quartet (split by the adjacent CH3). The chemical shift for OCH2CH3 is usually around δ4.1-4.3 ppm. However, the given NMR has a quartet at 4.5 ppm. Is that possible? Maybe there is some de-shielding, but perhaps in this context, the neighboring groups could shift it a bit. But perhaps this requires consideration. Alternatively, maybe there is an additional group adjacent. 

The COOCH2CH3 group:

- The ethoxy group (OCH2CH3): The CH2 attached to oxygen is expected as a quartet around δ4.0-4.3 ppm. If the NMR indicates a quartet at 4.5 ppm, maybe there's an adjacent nitrogens exerting an effect, but benzocaine’s ethoxy should be around δ4.1-4.3. Hmm. The observed shift in the data is 4.5 ppm, a bit higher than standard. However, in benzocaine, how does it work?

Alternatively, perhaps there's an ethyl group connected not to oxygen but to another group. Wait, let's check again.

NH2-(phenyl)-COOCH2CH3:

N-methyl group? No amino in the ethoxy.

Alternatively, the NH2 in the para position would cause anisotropy, moving the ester OCH2CH3's chemical shift? Maybe. Alternatively, we may need to reevaluate.

In ethanol, the protons on the OCH2CH3 in an ester are typically around δ4.3 ppm for OCH2. For example, ethyl acetate has the OCH2 at ~4.12 (quartet) and CH3 at 1.23 (triplet). In benzocaine, the effect might be slightly shifted by the aromatic ring's proximity, but δ4.5 may still be justifiable.

The NMR also indicates a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. In benzocaine, the NH2 group (para to the ester) might have protons as broad signals. However, aromatic amines (aniline derivatives) typically have NH2 protons around δ3.5-5 ppm as broad signals due to possible hydrogen bonding or exchange. But in benzocaine, the NH2 group of the para-aminobenzoate is conjugated to the aromatic ring and may show a broad peak around δ5-7 ppm. Alternatively, because it's para to the ester, the conjugation might influence its chemical shift.

Wait, but in the given NMR data, the NH2 is at δ4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. Possibly, this could be a flexible argument accounting for its position and exchange broadening. Let me check literature values. For example, the NH2 protons in benzocaine appear as a broad peak around δ5.0-6.0, integrating for 2H and possibly split into a doublet if coupled with neighboring protons. The current data at δ4.0 ppm might instead suggest that it's not the aromatic NH2. Alternatively, could the NH2 be part of a different group? For example, in a urea or carbamate group. But then we would need additional analysis.

Wait, the formula for benzocaine (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) is C9H11NO2. Let’s check the exact structure:

Phenyl ring (C6H5) with NH2 (at position 4) and COOEt (ester at position 1). Its molecule should then have:

The aromatic protons would be at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 (assuming 1 is COOEt, 4 is NH2). The NH2 group at para position to the ester. Then, the H at 2,6 and 3,5 positions would be equivalent each. If the substituent at 1 is COOEt (electron-withdrawing ester, which is meta-directing) and the substituent at 4 is NH2 (electron-donating, para to the ester).

In such a scenario, the positions of aromatic protons and their chemical shifts would depend on the substituents.

In para-aminobenzoic acid (free acid), the aromatic protons adjacent to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded compared to positions 3 and 5. Wait, no. The substituents’ effects are as follows: The ester group (COOEt) is an electron-withdrawing group (due to conjugation), making the ring deactivating and meta-directing. The NH2 group (para to the ester) is electron-donating (activating, para to itself), so the NH2 is donating electrons via resonance, causing the adjacent positions (ortho to NH2) to be deshielded? Wait, orientation of substitution and neighboring effects can be complex.

In such dichlorobenzene analogs, in a para-substituted arrangement, the aromatic protons often show coupling patterns. For the given molecule, there is likely symmetry. If NH2 is at para to the ester group (positions 1 and 4), the adjacent hydrogen atoms would be at positions 2 and 6 (meta to COOEt) and 3 and 5 (meta to NH2).

Alternatively, consideringthat the ester group deactivates the ring and the amino group donates electrons, the actual chemical shifts of the aromatic protons would vary. The H atoms adjacent to the COOEt group (ortho to it) would experience a more deshielded (downfield) shift, while those adjacent to the NH2 (ortho to NH2) would experience shielded (upfield) shifts due to electron-donating effect.

But in the given NMR, the aromatic protons are δ7.0 (d, 2H) and δ8.0 (d, 2H). In benzene rings with two substituents para to each other, lots depend on the substituents. If we have one substituent (COOEt) at position 1 and NH2 at position 4 (para), then all the aromatic protons (positions 2,3,5,6) would form a coupled system. But considering the substituents, each adjacent ring position is either ortho to COOEt or to NH2. Let's say positions 2: ortho to COOEt (positions 1 and 4's para).

Alternatively, this analysis is getting a bit tangled; perhaps just to compare with literature data.

In ethyl para-aminobenzoate (benzocaine), the aromatic protons consist of two doublets. The protons adjacent to the NH2 (positions 2 and 6 of the benzene ring) should be more upfield due to electron donation, whereas those adjacent to the ester group (positions and another m-position) may be more downfield. 

Looking for benzocaine’s actual NMR data:

In reference, benzocaine typically shows two doublets in the aromatic region. According to SDBS (Spectral Database for Organic Compounds): 

Benzocaine 1H NMR (CDCl3):

- δ1.38 (t, J=7.1 Hz, 3H) for the CH3 of the ethyl group.
- δ4.33 (q, J=7.1 Hz, 2H) for the OCH2 of ester.
- δ6.62 (d, J=8.8 Hz, 2H) for aromatic protons adjacent to NH2.
- δ7.89 (d, J=8.8 Hz, 2H) for aromatic protons adjacent to COOEt.
- The NH2 protons usually show as a broad peak around δ4.0-4.5 ppm in deuterated solvents. However, in practice, if the NH2 group is not exchanging (for example, in DMSO-d6), the protons can appear as a broad peak. However, in CDCl3, they may not be very apparent because they may exchange too quickly, leading to a broad hump rather than distinct peaks. Alternatively, the sample could have been protonated, making the NH2 into NH3+ (in acidic conditions), but this depends on the solvent.

The given NMR data includes:

1.20 ppm (t,3H): which matches closely with the ethoxy CH3.
4.5 ppm (q,2H): the OCH2. However, in standard benzocaine literature, ethyl's OCH2 is at higher ppm (~4.3).

The readout here has OCH2 at 4.5. Though slightly upshifted, likely due to the presence of NH2 deshielding it.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): This could correspond to NH2 as per the IR. However, perhaps in this case, the data may have been taken in a solvent where NH2 is observable. Alternatively, maybe the actual structure is slightly different.

The aromatic protons in benzocaine are at δ6.62 (d) and δ7.89 (d), which is close to the user’s data (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm). The reported downfield shift (8.0 ppm) matches the protons adjacent to the ester group (since COOEt is electron-withdrawing). The upfield (7.0 ppm) protons are adjacent to the NH2 group. Thus, assignments align if the provided data corresponds to these values, albeit with possible slight variations based on the solvent or sample conditions.

Another matchup: the quartet at 4.5 ppm for OCH2 in the user’s data versus 4.33 for benzocaine. The slight upfield shift could be due to the -NH2 being conjugated in the ring, but I think it's close enough to be possible.

So, considering all these observations:

- Molecular formula C9H11NO2 fits for benzocaine (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate).
- IR shows N-H and C=O ester, aligning.
- NMR has ethyl group (triplet and quartet), aromatic doublets, and a broad NH2.

So, based on this analysis, the compound is benzocaine – ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

**Confidence Level:** High confidence based on IR peaks (N-H, ester C=O), NMR match (ethyl group, aromatic doublets, NH2 singlet). However, if any discrepancies exist (for example, exact chemical shifts for OCH2), they are minor and could be explained by solvent or concentration differences. Therefore, the compound is most likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine).
