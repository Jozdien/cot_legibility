# Original Question

A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.
What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?

(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)

Given a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s (0.2c) from the Galaxy's reference frame, we need to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame: \( v = 0.2c \)
   - Proper time in the ejecta's frame: \( \Delta t' = 50 \) seconds

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

3. **Convert the proper time to the Galaxy's frame (\(\Delta t\)):**
   \[
   \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \times \Delta t = 60,000 \text{ km/s} \times 51.03 \text{ s} \approx 3,061,800 \text{ km}
   \]

After considering the exact calculations and significant figures, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is:

\[
\boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Alright, I need to figure out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, okay. Let's see. The problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the Galactic center, and both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, velocity is given from the ejecta's perspective as the Galaxy moving at 0.2c? Because 60,000 km/s is 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2 times the speed of light. So, v = 0.2c.

But wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c. But from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 0.2c. Since they are inertial frames, the velocity should be opposite. So, each sees the other moving at 0.2c but in the opposite direction.

But the question is: In the Galaxy's frame, how much distance does the ejecta cover when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, time is measured in the ejecta's frame, but we need the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, this is tricky because we're dealing with different reference frames and time dilation or length contraction might come into play.

First, let me note down what's given:

- Velocity of the Galaxy's center as seen from the ejecta's frame: v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c (since c ≈ 300,000 km/s)

- Proper time in the ejecta's frame: Δt' = 50 seconds

We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time. Wait, but if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame, right? Because from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 0.2c, so conversely, from Galaxy's frame, ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c. Since they are moving at 0.2c relative to each other.

But here's the thing: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at 0.2c. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta must be approaching at 0.2c.

But how is the time involved? The time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, so we need to relate that to the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame, right? Wait. If 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame? Due to time dilation?

Wait, so in special relativity, time dilation is reciprocal. I think that's only when the event is happening at the same place in one of the frames. Wait, maybe to relate the times between two frames, we need to use the Lorentz transformation.

The ejecta's frame is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy's frame. So, any event's coordinates in the Galaxy's frame (t, x) can be transformed to the ejecta's frame (t', x') using Lorentz transform.

But which Lorentz transformation equation applies here? We have the time experienced in the ejecta's frame (Δt') and we need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) which is not necessarily as straightforward as multiplying by gamma, but maybe if the events are happening at the same position in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but the ejecta itself is moving in Galaxy's frame. The problem says, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is approaching at 0.2c, and we want to know the distance that the ejecta has traveled in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds of ejecta's proper time.

So from the ejecta's perspective, 50 seconds pass, during which the Galaxy's center is moving towards them at 0.2c. So, in ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy center has moved is v * Δt' = 0.2c * 50 s. But if we find the distance in the ejecta's frame, can we relate that to the Galaxy's frame?

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the time in the Galaxy frame first.

Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c according to the Galaxy's (S) frame.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c. The proper time Δt' = 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

In special relativity, the proper time is the time between two events that occur at the same spatial position in that frame. So in this case, say, the ejecta doesn't move in its own frame (because it's at rest), so in the ejecta's frame, the two events (start and end of timing) are at the same spatial coordinates. In the Galaxy's frame, however, the ejecta is moving, so those two events are separated by both time and space.

So, using the time dilation formula: the proper time Δt' is related to the coordinate time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) by:

Δt' = Δt / γ , where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but this applies only if the two events (start and end) are co-located in the ejecta's frame, which they are. So the time between events in S' (ejecta) is Δt', which is 50 s, and to find the time between same events in S (Galaxy), it's Δt = γ * Δt'.

But in the Galaxy's frame, during that time Δt, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, so the distance traveled would be v * Δt.

So putting this together:

Distance in Galaxy's frame = v * γ * Δt'.

Therefore:

v = 0.2c, as per Galaxy frame.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So γ ≈ 1.0206.

Thus Δt in Galaxy's frame would be γ * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Then, distance traveled in Galaxy's frame would be 0.2c * 51.03 s.

Calculate first 0.2c: 0.2 * 300,000 km/s = 60,000 km/s (as given).

Wait, so 0.2c * 51.03 s = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km.

But wait, 60,000 km/s * 1 s = 60,000 km. So per second, it's 60,000 km. For 51.03 seconds, multiply by 51.03.

Let me calculate that:

First, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.

60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800 km.

So total would be approx 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but 51.03 - 50 = 1.03, right?

But in reality, we can calculate it more precisely.

Calculating 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 * 50 + 60,000 * 1.03 = 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Therefore, the distance the ejecta travels in Galaxy's frame is approximately 3,061,800 km. Hmm.

But let's check my logic. Let me assume the time dilation approach is correct. Are there any factors I'm missing, such as length contraction?

Wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 0.2c. What's the time measured in Galaxy's frame? Events that are 50 seconds apart in the ejecta's frame (proper time) would be longer in the Galaxy's frame due to time dilation. Wait, but gamma is 1.02 something. So actually, time in Galaxy's frame is dilated compared to the ejecta? Wait, I'm confused.

Wait, normally time dilation says that moving clocks run slow. If the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the Galaxy, then the Galaxy would see the ejecta's clocks running slow, correct? So if 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, the Galaxy would say that more time has passed? Wait, but actually, because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving, so yes, its clocks would run slower. However, the problem is stating that the ejecta measures 50 seconds of proper time. So to find out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame for the same two events. Wait, in this case, since the two events are co-located in ejecta's frame, they will be separated by some time and distance in Galaxy's frame.

According to the time dilation formula: Δt = γ * Δτ, where Δτ is the proper time in the moving frame (ejecta). So Δt should be longer than Δτ by gamma. So in this case, 1.02 times 50 s is indeed 51.03 s. So, in Galaxy's frame, 51.03 sec pass, and in that time, the ejecta travels at 0.2c which is 60,000 km/s, so distance is indeed roughly 3,061,800 km.

But I'm supposed to give a precise answer, maybe not approximate. Let me recast the calculations exactly.

First, gamma:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Given v = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04, 1 - 0.04 = 0.96, sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) which is (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ but right, just leave it as sqrt(0.96).

Similarly, γ is 1/sqrt(0.96) exactly, so if we can keep it as 1/sqrt(0.96) * 50 seconds for Δt.

Alternatively, it's gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) as we wrote.

Alternatively, sqrt(0.96) is sqrt(24/25) which is (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ do NOT know if exact value is helpful.

Alternatively, use decimal expressions.

Alternatively, compute sqrt(0.96):

sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798. Then, 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So for precise calculation, compute Δt = gamma * 50 ≈ 1.0206 * 50 = 51.030 seconds.

Then, distance in Galaxy's frame is 0.2c * 51.030 s.

But c is 300,000 km/s. So, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s.

60,000 km/s * 51.030 s = (I can compute 60,000*50=3,000,000) plus (60,000*1.030=61,800). So total 3,061,800 km.

Is there an exact formula for this, or is approximation okay?

Alternatively, maybe use exact calculation.

But let me try computing more precisely:

sqrt(0.96) using calculator:

sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9797958976

So γ = 1 / 0.9797958976 ≈ 1.020620726

Hence, Δt = 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.03103632 seconds

Then, 51.03103632 * 60,000 km/s:

First, 50 seconds is 3,000,000 km, then 1.031 s is approx 1.031*60,000 = 61,860 km

So altogether, 3,000,000 + 61,860 ≈ 3,061,860 km. Which is ~3.06186 x 10^6 km.

But the exact calculation:

51.03103632 * 60,000 = ?

Compute 50 * 60,000 = 3,000,000 km

Leftover is 1.03103632 * 60,000 = ?

1.03103632 * 60,000 = (1 + 0.03103632) * 60,000 = 60,000 + 0.03103632 * 60,000

0.03103632 x 60,000 = 0.03103632 x 6 x 10^4 = 0.18621792 x 10^4 = 1862.1792 km

Thus total would be 60,000 + 1,862.1792 = 61,862.1792 km

Hence, total distance is 3,000,000 + 61,862.1792 ≈ 3,061,862.1792 km

Which is approximately 3,061,862 km. So approximately 3,061,862 km

But the problem states that the velocity is exactly 60,000 km/s (maybe precise), so maybe keeping more digits in gamma:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1.020620726

So Δt = 50 * 1.020620726 = 51.0310363 seconds

Multiply again exact:

v = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 * 51.0310363 = ?

Let's compute:

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000

60,000 * 1.0310363 = 60,000 * 1 + 60,000 * 0.0310363

= 60,000 + 1,862.178

Total: 60,000 + 1,862.178 = 61,862.178

Hence, total distance: 3,000,000 + 61,862.178 = 3,061,862.178 km

So ≈ 3,061,862 km. Hmm.

But given that the problem gives the velocity as exactly 60,000 km/s, which is exact (without decimals), maybe assuming velocity is exact and gamma is exact as per 0.2c. So perhaps present it as an exact fraction. Let's do it symbolically:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 /c^2)

v = 0.2c so:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1 / 0.96) = sqrt(25/24) ≈ but wait, 1/0.96 = 25/24's inverse?

Wait, 0.96 = 24/25, right? 24/25=0.96, thus 1/0.96 = 25/24. Therefore, sqrt(25/24) = 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)). Wait:

sqrt(25/24) = 5 / sqrt(24) = 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)) but possibly less helpful.

Alternatively, considering this:

v = 0.2c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) = (sqrt(0.96))^-1

So, would we prefer to express the total distance as:

distance = v * gamma * t_ejecta

Where t_ejecta is 50 s,

v = 0.2c,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04).

So written as distance = 0.2c * 50 / sqrt(0.96) ?

Thus, replacing c with exact 3e5 km/s,

distance = 0.2 * 3e5 km/s * 50 s / sqrt(0.96) = 0.2 * 3e5 * 50 / sqrt(0.96)

Compute numerator: 0.2 * 3e5 = 6e4, and 6e4 * 50 = 3e6

Hence, 3e6 / sqrt(0.96)

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (2 * sqrt(6))/5

Therefore,

distance = 3e6 / ( (2*sqrt(6))/5 ) = 3e6 * 5/(2*sqrt(6)) = (15e6) / (2 * sqrt(6))

Rationalizing the denominator:

15e6 / (2 * sqrt(6)) * sqrt(6)/sqrt(6) = 15e6 sqrt(6) / 12 = (15e6 / 12) * sqrt(6) = (5e6 / 4) * sqrt(6)

Wait, is this correct?

Yeah,

sqrt(24) is sqrt(4*6) = 2 sqrt(6). So, the previous step:

distance = 3e6 divided by (2 sqrt(6)/5). So division is inverse, multiplying by 5/(2 sqrt(6)).

Thus 3e6 * 5 / (2 sqrt(6)) = 15e6 / (2 sqrt(6)), and in rationalized form = 15e6 sqrt(6) / 12, simplified to 5e6 sqrt(6)/4.

But that's perhaps complicating it.

Compute sqrt(6) ≈ 2.4495

Thus, 5e6 / 4 * 2.4495 ≈ (1.25e6) * 2.4495 ≈

1.25e6 * 2 = 2.5e6

1.25e6 * 0.4495 ≈ 1.25e6*0.4 = 5e5, 1.25e6*0.0495≈61875.

So total ≈ 2.5e6 + 5e5 +61875 ≈ 3,061,875 km

Which is around 3,061,875 km, close to the previous approximate value. So basically, exact answer is (5,000,000 / 4) * sqrt(6) km ≈ as above, but perhaps better to give decimal.

But maybe the problem prefers if instead of going through time dilation and gamma, one uses the velocity addition formula? Wait, but frames are inertial and velocity calculations might be simpler?

Wait, the problem says in ejecta's frame Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c. Then, in Galaxy’s frame ejecta is moving at 0.2c. But then the time experienced is via time dilation.

Alternatively, If we consider that 50 seconds pass in ejecta's frame, which is move is moving at 0.2c with respect to Galaxy. So But using straightforward SR relations:

In the ejecta’s own frame, 50 seconds pass. So, the Galaxy's center is moving at 0.2c, so during that time, in ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center approaches by velocity * time: 0.2c * 50s. But this is distance in ejecta's frame. The problem asks for distance in Galaxy’s frame.

But to convert this distance, since it's moving at 0.2c, would length contraction apply? Wait, length contraction is between two frames; the distance in one frame is related to the proper length in another.

Wait, if in galaxy's frame the ejecta is moving towards center at 0.2c. Then the distance the ejecta travels is in Galaxy frame, is just velocity (0.2c) times the time measured in Galaxy's frame for this journey. But in ejecta's frame, the trip takes 50 s. Thus, need to calculate gamma to relate the times.

Hence my original approach is sound. So the answer is 0.2c * gamma * 50 s ≈ 3,061,862 km.

But since the problem states "sixty thousand km/s", which is c/5 ≈ 0.2c, and the time is "50 seconds in the ejecta reference frame", I think that in their formalism, take into account gamma.

Hence, 0.2c * gamma * 50 seconds. Even though velocities are not that high (0.2c), giving a ~2% correction. Since 0.2c is relativistic but not extremely high.

Alternatively, maybe that naive approach fails. Wait, maybe you can use the velocity in the Galaxy frame and convert the time.

Therefore, yes, the time experienced by the ejecta's own clock is 50 s. So, according to the Galaxy's frame, the time is 51.03... s, so just over 51s, hence the distance traveled is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3.06 million km.

But to check, if not using SR and just pretend classic, in ejecta's frame, galaxy center moves 0.2c * 50 s.

So 0.2 c * 50 s = distance in ejecta frame. Then, maybe Galilean transform, perhaps?

But in that case, classicvelocity addition, but wouldn't make sense because distances are not preserved.

Wait, but no, in ejecta's frame Galaxy is moving at 0.2c for 50s, so distance covered would be 0.2 * 3e5 km/s * 50s = 3e5 * 0.2 = 6e4 km/s * 50 = 3e6 km? Then, I thought just multiplied v * t in ejecta frame. But if we classically assumed that distance is the same in both frames, but since relativity is at play, that's incorrect. Hence in relativity, length and time are different. Since I get confused here.

Wait, the distance in ejecta frame is V * t'_ejecta, where V is galaxy's speed in ejecta frame. Then, in galaxy's frame, would that distance be length contracted (since from galaxy's frame, ejecta is moving. Therefore, the length in ejecta's frame (LV) would appear length-contracted in galaxy's frame. So L = L' * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Wait, could be.

But then we may derive this. But maybe this reverses the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps when converting the distance from the ejecta's frame to the Galaxy's frame: but according to Galaxy's frame, ejecta is moving. If you must think, ok.

But perhaps the standard calculation is

The distance in the Galaxy’s frame (S) would be L = L' * gamma, because moving lengths are contracted, thus proper length is longer.

Wait, to resolve confusion:

If you have an object at rest in S', with proper length L', then in S, it's moving and has length L' / gamma. But here, in S' (ejecta's frame), the entire galaxy is moving towards them, so is that an object length?

Not the same? The way the displacement was calculated is in the ejecta frame, the Galaxy moved L' = v * t = 0.2c * 50 s. Then, in Galaxy’s frame, ejecta moved distance L = ?

But I think swapping reference frames can be dangerous. Because the operations here involve time and positions in different frames.

Alternatively, maybe we need to calculate the coordinates of the event.

Assuming in ejecta's frame (S'), the origin is at the ejecta, which is stationary. The event of leaving the supernova might be at origin. Assume that at t' = 0, the Galaxy center is at x' = something. But need info if Galaxy center was at same event as the ejecta. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to set up Lorentz transformation equations.

Define Galaxy’s frame as S, ejecta as S', moving at v = 0.2c towards the Galactic center. So, taking direction towards Galaxy as positive. Wait: from ejecta's frame, Galaxy’s center is moving towards ejecta at 0.2c, which in ejecta’s frame (S') it's negative direction. Hmm, coordinate systems. Let me set:

In S (Galaxy frame), ejecta is moving towards Galactic center (assuming positive x direction), with speed v = 0.2 c.

In S' (ejecta's frame), Galactic center approaches (x' decreasing?) with speed 0.2c.

Assuming standard Lorentz transformations:

x = gamma*(x' + vt')

t = gamma*(t' + (v x')/c^2)

In S', the Galactic center is moving as per x' = -0.2 c t'?

Because in the ejecta’s frame, the Galactic center moves towards them at 0.2c, so position at time t' is x' = x_0 - 0.2c t'. If we take the ejecta is at rest at x' = 0, so if at t' = 0, the Galactic center is at x' = D, then x'_gc = D - 0.2c t'

But we need to find how much distance ejecta travels in Galaxy's frame when 50 s pass in ejecta's frame. So setting up coordinates.

Let’s say in Galaxy's frame:

Supernova explosion happens at origin.

Ejecta is moving toward center (position x decreasing? Or increasing? Let's assume center is at x = +infinity, does it matter?)

Wait, to define positions let's assume:

In Galaxy’s frame: Galactic center is at x =0. Supernova occurs at some point. Ejecta is moving towards Galactic center (x decreasing) at velocity v =-0.2c (if x increasing is away from the center). Wait, think this might complicate, perhaps Coloring x in ejecta frame:

Alternatively. Assume at t=0 in both frames (using t and t') =0 events coincided? Lorentz transformations necessarily synchronize events only at t=0 if we set origins appropriately.

Wait, let's choose such that at t =0 in Galaxy's frame, S', the ejecta is at position x =0 , t'=0 .

Then, in Galaxy’s frame, ejecta is moving toward Galactic center which is at some point. Wait, need to know positions, but maybe I can ignore that.

Wait, tracked two events: start and end. The start is when ejecta's clock starts (t'=0), beginning of the journey, and the end is when ejecta's clock shows 50s (t'=50).

In ejecta's frame, those two events (say, two ticks of the ejecta's clock) are at same x' =0, so (x’=0, t’=0) and (x’=0, t’=50).

We can use Lorentz transformation equations to find the time and position coordinates in Galaxy's frame.

For these two events.

First event: x'=0, t’=0.

Galaxy's coordinates (using inverse Lorentz transformation from S' to S):

x = gamma*(x' + v t’ )

t = gamma*(t’ + (v x')/c^2 )

Plugging in: x’=0, t’=0: => x=0, t=0.

Second event: x’=0, t’=50:

 x = gamma*(0 + v * 50 s) = gamma * v * 50 s

 t = gamma*(50 s + (v * 0)/c^2) = gamma * 50 s

So, in Galaxy's frame, the two events (start and end of the 50s in ejecta’s frame) are separated by:

Δt = gamma *50 s

and this the ejecta moves from x=0 to x= gamma *v *50 s

Thus, the distance the ejecta moves in Galaxy's frame is gamma *v *50:

Distance L = gamma * v * tau (tau = proper time)

Thus, L = gamma * v * tau, since tau = 50 s.

Exactly as I initially figured. Therefore, with v =0.2c, gamma =1/sqrt(0.96), gives gamma *0.2c *50 s= your answer.

So, exactly:

L = (1/sqrt(0.96)) * 0.2c *50

Given c =3e5 km/s,

Therefore,

L = (0.2 *3e5 *50)/sqrt(0.96) = (3e6)/sqrt(0.96)

Swapped numbers from earlier my steps.

Yes, same as previous.

Sqrt(0.96) ≈0.9798 as before.

3e6 /0.9798≈3e6*(1.020620726)≈3,061,862 km

Hence exact answer is approx 3,061,862 km.

Hence, boxed answer would be with approximated value, I think, since the problem didn't specify to use fractions or exact sqrt terms. Pass to significant figures.

V is given as 60,000 km/s. Given as 2 significant figures? Depending on whether 60,000 is an exact number, the answer Should probably stick with two, but since time 50 s is also two, 3.1e6 km? Wait, but actually, need to check. If 60,000 km/s is V takes 60,000 as exact but 0.2c would imply perhaps precision.

But as exact, okay. then present.

Wait, plug in the numbers to decimal.

L =3,061,862 km perhaps, but instead, maybe formatted as 3.06 x10^6 km.

But 'Acceptable form usually'？



**Final Answer**
The ejecta travels approximately \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}} in the Galaxy reference frame.

Alright, I need to figure out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, okay. Let's see. The problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the Galactic center, and both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, velocity is given from the ejecta's perspective as the Galaxy moving at 0.2c? Because 60,000 km/s is 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2 times the speed of light. So, v = 0.2c.

But wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c. But from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 0.2c. Since they are inertial frames, the velocity should be opposite. So, each sees the other moving at 0.2c but in the opposite direction.

But the question is: In the Galaxy's frame, how much distance does the ejecta cover when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, time is measured in the ejecta's frame, but we need the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, this is tricky because we're dealing with different reference frames and time dilation or length contraction might come into play.

First, let me note down what's given:

- Velocity of the Galaxy's center as seen from the ejecta's frame: v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c (since c ≈ 300,000 km/s)

- Proper time in the ejecta's frame: Δt' = 50 seconds

We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time. Wait, but if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame, right? Because from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 0.2c, so conversely, from Galaxy's frame, ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c. Since they are moving at 0.2c relative to each other.

But here's the thing: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at 0.2c. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta must be approaching at 0.2c.

But how is the time involved? The time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, so we need to relate that to the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame, right? Wait. If 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame? Due to time dilation?

Wait, so in special relativity, time dilation is reciprocal. I think that's only when the event is happening at the same place in one of the frames. Wait, maybe to relate the times between two frames, we need to use the Lorentz transformation.

The ejecta's frame is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy's frame. So, any event's coordinates in the Galaxy's frame (t, x) can be transformed to the ejecta's frame (t', x') using Lorentz transform.

But which Lorentz transformation equation applies here? We have the time experienced in the ejecta's frame (Δt') and we need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) which is not necessarily as straightforward as multiplying by gamma, but maybe if the events are happening at the same position in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but the ejecta itself is moving in Galaxy's frame. The problem says, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is approaching at 0.2c, and we want to know the distance that the ejecta has traveled in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds of ejecta's proper time.

So from the ejecta's perspective, 50 seconds pass, during which the Galaxy's center is moving towards them at 0.2c. So, in ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy center has moved is v * Δt' = 0.2c * 50 s. But if we find the distance in the ejecta's frame, can we relate that to the Galaxy's frame?

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the time in the Galaxy frame first.

Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c according to the Galaxy's (S) frame.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c. The proper time Δt' = 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

In special relativity, the proper time is the time between two events that occur at the same spatial position in that frame. So in this case, say, the ejecta doesn't move in its own frame (because it's at rest), so in the ejecta's frame, the two events (start and end of timing) are at the same spatial coordinates. In the Galaxy's frame, however, the ejecta is moving, so those two events are separated by both time and space.

So, using the time dilation formula: the proper time Δt' is related to the coordinate time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) by:

Δt' = Δt / γ , where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but this applies only if the two events (start and end) are co-located in the ejecta's frame, which they are. So the time between events in S' (ejecta) is Δt', which is 50 s, and to find the time between same events in S (Galaxy), it's Δt = γ * Δt'.

But in the Galaxy's frame, during that time Δt, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, so the distance traveled would be v * Δt.

So putting this together:

Distance in Galaxy's frame = v * γ * Δt'.

Therefore:

v = 0.2c, as per Galaxy frame.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So γ ≈ 1.0206.

Thus Δt in Galaxy's frame would be γ * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Then, distance traveled in Galaxy's frame would be 0.2c * 51.03 s.

Calculate first 0.2c: 0.2 * 300,000 km/s = 60,0

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame during 50 seconds of the ejecta's proper time. Let me analyze this systematically.

The problem states that the ejecta is moving directly toward the Galactic center. From the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy's center approaches at 60,000 km/s, which equals 0.2c (since 60,000/300,000 = 0.2). Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at 0.2c toward the center.

Since we're dealing with different reference frames, I need to consider relativistic effects. The question asks for the distance covered in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Given information:
- Relative velocity between frames: v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c
- Proper time in ejecta's frame: Δt' = 50 seconds

To relate the time in the ejecta's frame to the Galaxy's frame, I'll use time dilation. Since the 50 seconds represent proper time in the ejecta's frame (events occurring at the same spatial position), I can calculate the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame using:

Δt = γ × Δt'

Where γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²)

Calculating γ:
γ = 1/√(1-(0.2c)²/c²) = 1/√(1-0.04) = 1/√0.96 ≈ 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.0206

Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame would be:
Δt ≈ 1.0206 × 50 seconds ≈ 51.03 seconds

The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame would be:
Distance = v × Δt = 0.2c × 51.03 seconds = 0.2 × 300,000 km/s × 51.03 seconds

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let's see. The problem states that some of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the Galactic center, and both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Therefore, the velocity from the ejecta's perspective is the Galaxy moving at 0.2c, since 60,000 km/s equates to 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2 times the speed of light. So, v = 0.2c.

However, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c, and from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center approaches it at 0.2c. Since both are inertial frames, the velocities should be opposite, with each viewing the other as moving at 0.2c in the opposite direction.

The question is: In the Galaxy's frame, what distance does the ejecta cover when 50 seconds elapse in the ejecta's frame? Thus, time is measured from the ejecta's frame, but we need the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

This situation is complex due to dealing with different reference frames, where time dilation or length contraction could apply.

Let's note down the given information:

- Velocity of the Galaxy's center as observed from the ejecta's frame: v = 60,000 km/s = 0.2c (since c ≈ 300,000 km/s)

- Proper time in the ejecta's frame: Δt' = 50 seconds

We need to ascertain the distance the ejecta traverses in the Galaxy's frame during that time. If the ejecta moves at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame, because from its frame, the Galaxy moves towards it at 0.2c, so consequently, from Galaxy's frame, the ejecta heads toward the center at 0.2c, given their mutual velocity.

From the perspective of the ejecta, the Galaxy's center advances at 0.2c. Consequently, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta also approaches at 0.2c.

Regarding time: the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, therefore we need to correlate that to the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame via time dilation.

In special relativity, time dilation is reciprocal, yet this is only when an event occurs at one location in one frame. To connect times between two frames, the Lorentz transformation is needed.

The ejecta's frame moves at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy's frame. Thus, transforming any event's coordinates in the Galaxy's frame (t, x) to the ejecta's frame (t', x') involves the Lorentz transform.

But which Lorentz equation is relevant here? We have the time experienced in the ejecta's frame (Δt') and need to determine the time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt). This isn't simply multiplying by gamma unless events align spatially in the ejecta frame.

As the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame, according to the problem, the center approaches at 0.2c in the ejecta's frame, and we need to discover the distance covered by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame over 50 seconds of proper time in the ejecta's frame.

From the ejecta’s view, 50 seconds elapse whilst the Galactic center moves towards them at 0.2c. Therefore, in the ejecta's frame, the space traversed by the Galactic center is v * Δt' = 0.2c * 50 s. But if we calculate the distance in ejecta's perspective, can we relate that to the Galaxy's view?

Alternatively, determining the time in the Galaxy frame might be a starting point.

As the ejecta is moving at 0.2c per the Galaxy's (S) frame, within the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy moves at -0.2c. The proper time Δt' = 50 seconds holds in the ejecta's frame.

Special relativity posits proper time as the interval between two events at an identical spatial position in that frame. Here, the ejecta remains static in its view (being stationary), therefore events (start and finish of timing) have matching spatial locations. However, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is mobile, causing those events to differ in time and space.

Using the time dilation formula: proper time Δt' relates to coordinate time in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) by:

Δt' = Δt / γ , where γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

This applies if two events (start and end) coincide in the ejecta's frame, and they do. Thus, the time between these events in S' (ejecta) is Δt', 50 s, and to determine their time span in S (Galaxy), Δt = γ * Δt'.

Yet in the Galaxy's frame, during Δt, the ejecta travels at 0.2c, with the distance being v * Δt.

Assembling it:

Distance in Galaxy's frame = v * γ * Δt'.

Therefore:

v = 0.2c, per Galaxy frame.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

Thus γ ≈ 1.0206.

Thus, Δt in the Galaxy's frame would be γ * 50 s ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Consequently, the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame would be 0.2c * 51.03 s.

Calculate first 0.2c: 0.2 * 300,000 km/s = 60,000 km/s.

Wait, 0.2*3e5 km/s = 6e4 km/s, which is 60,000 km/s. But that matches the initial velocity.\n\nSo then 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km.\n\nWait, compute that:\n\n50 seconds would be 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km,\n\nso 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,000,000 + 60,000 *1.03 = 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut that seems. Wait, but is this approach right?\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of Lorentz transformations. When events happen at the same place in S\', the coordinates in S can be found using:\n\nΔt = γ(Δt\' + (vΔx\')/c² )\n\nBut since Δx\' = 0 (since it\'s the same location in S\'), so Δt = γΔt\'\n\nTherefore, Δt = γΔt\', so the time elapsed in S is γ times the proper time in S\'. Therefore, the calculation above is correct. So the time in the Galaxy frame is gamma times 50 seconds.\n\nSo distance is v * gamma * delta t’ = 0.2c * 1.0206 *50 ≈ 0.2c*51.03 as above.\n\nBut is there another perspective?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the length contraction formula? Although in this case, maybe not. Let\'s see.\n\nWait, length contraction is about the length of an object measured in different frames, but here we are measuring a distance that the object travels. So it\'s more about velocity and time.\n\nWait, but the velocity addition formula? But in this case, it\'s straightforward as the velocity is given as 0.2c in both frames. Because each frame is moving at 0.2c relative to the other. That seems inconsistent? Wait, no, in special relativity, if S\' is moving at velocity u relative to S, then S is moving at velocity -u relative to S\'. But velocity addition applies when considering a third object. But the problem doesn\'t have a third object.\n\nSo galaxy and ejecta are the two frames. Since the problem states both are inertial, and so the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the galaxy center in the galaxy frame, and vice versa. So the other than time dilation and length contraction, not sure what the issue is.\n\nWait, but here, in the galaxy frame, the time is longer due to gamma. So, what\'s matching is v * t = 0.2c * gamma * t’. That gives us the “naive” velocity multiplied by the time in the other frame.\n\nWait, but according to relativity, shouldn\'t the velocity of the Galaxy\'s center as measured in ejecta’s frame (0.2c) lead to a different velocity of the ejecta in Galaxy\'s frame? Wait, relative velocity should just be the same. Wait, can the velocity of S\' frame (ejecta) seen from S (Galaxy) be the same as velocity of S seen from S\'? According to Newtonian mechanics, it\'s just the negative. But in relativistiv addition?\n\nWait, actually in special relativity, the relative speed between frames is the same in both frames, A and B each see the other moving at speed v. So, if S\' is moving at speed v in S, then S is moving at speed v in the opposite direction in S\'.\n\nBut it\'s only when adding velocities of other objects that relativistic effects come in. So if in S, the Galaxy center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving at speed v towards it.\n\nIn S\', ejecta is stationary, and Galaxy is moving towards it at speed v. So as per the problem statement.\n\nTherefore velocity v is same, in opposite direction. Therefore, it seems the problem can be treated with time dilation. Therefore, proceed initial calculation.\n\nSo v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s.\n\nThen, gamma ≈ 1.0206.\n\nSo, t = gamma * t\' ≈ 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03sec.\n\nDistance in Galaxy frame:D = v*t = 60,000 km/s *51.03s ≈3,061,800 km. Rounded to five significant figures, approx 3,061,800 km, but maybe keeping more accurately.\n\nWait γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.\n\nsqrt(0.96) is since 0.98^2 = 0.9604. So since 0.9604 is just a bit larger than 0.96, so sqrt(0.96)= approx 0.9798. Let me compute.\n\nIf precise value, sqrt(1 - 0.04)=sqrt(1 - x)=1 - x/2 - x²/8 + ... approx. But quadratic approximation:\n\nsqrt(0.96)=sqrt(1 - 0.04)=1 - 0.04/2 - (0.04)^2/(8)=1 -0.02 -0.00016=0.97984. So yes, 0.97984, therefore gamma =1/0.97984≈1.02062.\n\nSo Δt=1.02062*50≈51.031 seconds.\n\nThen D=60,000 km/s*51.031 s=60,000*(50 +1.031)=3,000,000 +60,000*1.031.\n\n60,000*1= 60,000, 60,000*0.031=1860. Thus 60,000*1.031=61,860. So total distance=3,000,000+61,860=3,061,860 km.\n\nHmm. So approx 3.06186 ×10^6 km.\n\nBut the problem says, "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame".\n\nTherefore, the answer would be approximately 3.06 million km. But let me check with exact formula.\n\nExpress gamma exactly: gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))), where v=0.2c hence (v/c)=0.2.\n\nSo gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(1/0.96)=sqrt(25/24)=5/(2*sqrt(6))≈5/(4.89898)≈1.02062.\n\nYes, so.\n\nTherefore D= v * t =v * gamma t\'= 0.2c * gamma *50.\n\nCompute 0.2c is as above 60000 km/s.\n\nSo D=60000*gamma*50.\n\nSubstitute gamma=1.02062. Then:\n\nBut compute 50 seconds or not. Let\'s compute:\n\nD=60,000 km/s * 1.02062 *50s=60,000 *51.031=3,061,860 km.\n\nBut often, in problems like this, you use exact fractions when possible. Since gamma is 5/(2 sqrt(6)), which is equal to 5/(2*sqrt(6)). Let\'s check.\n\nv=0.2c, so time in Galaxy frame is  gamma*50. So, Distance =0.2c * 50 *gamma. Given that sqrt(24)=2*sqrt(6), so maybe the answer can expressed in terms of exact. But not sure. Alternatively, is the answer just 60,000 km/s multiplied by 51.031 seconds... uh, 0.2c =60,000 km/sec.\n\nBut this result seems okay.\n\nBut wait a second. Let me pause. Is that really the answer?\n\nIn other words, according to the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and the time that passed is 51.031 seconds (thus turned from 50 seconds in the ejecta\'s frame). Multiply velocity with time gives 3.06 million km.\n\nBut if time ran slower in the ejecta\'s frame compared to Galaxy\'s frame. So in order to have events that take 50 seconds in the ejecta\'s frame, more time passes in the Galaxy\'s frame? Then Galaxy\'s frame thinks that 51 seconds passed? Thus, the ejecta moves over 51 seconds *0.2c, which is more than 10 light seconds?\n\nWait, 0.2c is 60000 km/s, which is 60,000 per second. So in 50 seconds, it\'s 3 million km. But with gamma factor of ~1.02, adds another ~60,00 thousand km, making it 3.06 million.\n\nBut is that correct? Let\'s think in terms of muons. Muons have a longer lifetime in Earth frame, thus moving further. Similarly, here, since ejecta is moving, the proper time it experiences is less, so in Galaxy\'s frame, time is longer. Hence, more time passes, ejecta moves further.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, to check the answer perhaps via another route: using invariant spacetime interval.\n\nThe spacetime interval between two events (the starting and ending of the timer on the ejecta) is:\n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), the two events are at same position, dx\'=0, and dt\'=50 s. So interval ds^2 = c^2 dt\'^2.\n\nIn Galaxy\'s frame (S), the spacetime interval is ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2.\n\nSince interval is invariant:\n\nc²dt\'² = c²dt² - dx²\n\nDivide both sides by c²:\n\ndt\'^2 = dt^2 - (dx/c)^2.\n\nBut dx = v dt.\n\nTherefore:\n\ndt\'^2 = dt² - (v² dt²)/c²\n\nThen:\n\ndt\'^2= dt² (1 - v²/c²)\n\nTherefore, dt = dt\' / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = gamma dt\', which reinforces earlier result.\n\nThus,\n\nx = v dt = gamma v dt\'.\n\nHence, present result is precise.\n\nBut perhaps compute x numerically:\n\nx = v * gamma * dt\' = (0.2c) * gamma *50 =0.2*(3e5 km/s)*(1/sqrt(1 -0.04))*50 s\n\n=0.2*3e5*50 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nCompute numerator: 0.2 *3e5 =6e4; 6e4*50=3e6.\n\nSo numerator is 3e6 / sqrt(0.96).\n\nsqrt(0.96)= about 0.9798 as above, hence 3e6 /0.9798 ≈3,062,000 km. Therefore, same as before.\n\nTherefore, x≈3,062,000 km.\n\nAlternatively, precise calculation:\n\nLet\'s compute 0.96 under the square root precisely via calculator.\n\n√0.96:\n\nUsing calculator sqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.9797958976.\n\nBut let\'s not use explicit calculator steps. Let\'s do:\n\nApproximate 0.9797958976.\n\nThen 3,000,000 /0.9797958976=?\n\n0.9797958976*3,000,000=2,939,387.693 divide by again.\n\nWait, rather, x=3e6 /0.9797958976≈3,061,862 km.\n\nYes, rounding to about 3,061,862 kilometers. But since significant digits? The velocity given is 60,000 km/s, which is two significant figures? Wait, actually 60,000 is given as "sixty thousand km/s"—if written as 60,000, the trailing zeros can be ambiguous, but if specified with the words, maybe we can assume it\'s precise? Wait, also common that when dealing with high velocities in astronomy, numbers can be precise but presented as rounded. However, in any case, if v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c, and gamma was calculated as ~1.0206, leading to~3.06 million km. So, probable answer: Approximately 3.06 million kilometers.\n\nBut need to check the units and all again.\n\nWait, the given velocity is 60,000 km/s, so perhaps more precise if I multiply 60,000 with 1.02062 and multiply by 50? Wait, I had it the other way. Velocity is 60,000 km/s (from Galaxy frame\'s point of view, which is same as per calculation). Time in Galaxy frame is gamma *50 sec. So distance is 60,000 km/s * gamma *50. So.\n\ngamma is approximately1.0206, so x=60,000 *50 *1.0206.\n\nFirst, 60,000*50=3,000,000, then 3,000,000*1.0206=3,061,800. Therefore x=3,061,800 km. If I use more exact gamma=1.020620726, multiply 3,000,000: 3,000,000*1.020620726=3,000,000+3,000,000*0.020620726=3,000,000+61,862.178≈3,061,862.178 km. Which is about 3,061,862 km as before.\n\nIf the problem wants an exact answer in Boxed notation. But how significant digits? Velocity was given as 60,000, which is either one or two or more. But mostly considering 60,000 in the standard "three thousand" as exact, so 3.06 million km specified.\n\nAlternatively, exact calculation with v=0.2c. Let’s do it:\n\nDistance=0.2c* gamma*50. Since gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2)=1/sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(25/24)/sqrt(0.96)=?\n\nWait, exp(x)=1/sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(1/0.96)=sqrt(100/96)=sqrt(25/24)=5/(2*sqrt(6)).\n\nHmm, exact as 5/(2√6). Then Distance= 0.2c *50*5/(2√6)= (0.2*50*5)c/(2√6)= (50*5)c/(10√6)= (25c)/(10√6)= (5c)/(2√6))≈5*300,000/(2*2.449)≈1,500,000/4.898≈306,200 km? Wait, hmm, large maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps my algebraic step was:\n\n v is 0.2c, then velocity= 0.2 c.\n\ngamma=5/(2 sqrt(6)) as derived above, yeah.\n\nDistance= v * gamma *t\'.\n\nv=0.2c.\n\ngamma=5/(2 sqrt(6))\n\nt\'=50.\n\nTherefore, Distance= 0.2c *5/(2 sqrt(6)) *50=0.2*5*50/(2 sqrt(6)) *c= (50/sqrt(6))*c.\n\nWait that would be converting that:\n\n0.2 *5=1, divide by 2=0.5.\n\n0.5*50=25. So 25/sqrt(6)*c in some unit... Wait wait, hold on:\n\nWait, caulculate step by step:\n\n0.2*5=1.\n\nSo 0.2c*5/(2 sqrt(6))*50. 0.2c *5 is 1 c, then over (2 sqrt(6))*50.\n\nWait: Let me retry:\n\nDistance= 0.2c * gamma * 50. Since gamma=5/(2*sqrt(6)), then the equation becomes:\n\nDistance=0.2c * [5/(2*sqrt(6))] *50= 0.2 *5*50/(2*sqrt(6))*(c).\n\nMultiply numerator: 0.2*5=1; 1*50=50.\n\nDenominator: 2*sqrt(6). Therefore:\n\n50/(2*sqrt(6))=25/sqrt(6).\n\nSo distance=25/sqrt(6) * c.\n\nBut in this algebraic step, c can be in km/s.\n\nWait, c is in km/s (3e5 km/s). So Distance=25 / sqrt(6) *c≈25/2.449*3e5≈10.206*3e5≈3,061,800 km.\n\nTherefore, exact expression is 25/sqrt(6) *c, close to 3.06 million km.\n\nThus answer is about 3,061,862 km.\n\nBut written in Boxed notation. Whether to use integer, or which decimal precision. If problem wants exact arithmetic, use in the box as \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km}} or with precise value 3,062,000 km... Hmmm. Alternatively, to check whether there is calculator work...\n\nGiven that answer How precise. Depending upon the official answer\'s indicating.\n\nBut perhaps the intended answer in the problem is 3,000,000 km ± , but considering the velocity is given at 60,000 km/s, so exact answer≈50 *60,000=3,000,000 km, but then they want lhs top mention the relativistic shift. Hmm.\n\nWait in high school physics at times, if velocities are not as high, the difference is neglected. When v is 0.2c, which is 20% of light speed, relativistic effects are moderate but not negligible. Because gamma is squareroot(1 -0.04) invernse, which results in 1.0206. So only 2% time dilation. So distance is 2% greater than 3 million km. So the answer would be around 3.06 million km.\n\nBut maybe problem gives both in numbers. Should I present using exact values?\n\nConverting 25/sqrt(6)*c.\n\nCompute 25/sqrt(6):\n\nFirst, sqrt(6)=2.449489743.\n\n25/2.449489743≈10.206207.\n\nNevertheless, 10.206207*3e5 km=10.206207*300,000 km=3,061,862.1 km.\n\nSo exact answer≈3,061,862 km, approximately 3.062 million km.\n\nIn summary, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. So, boxed as \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km}} or if integer, maybe \\boxed{3061860 \\text{ km}} though that feels excessively precise.\n\nAlternatively, in the problem statement, given number at two significant figures, velocity is 60,000 km/s (could be taken as one significant digit, but more likely 2, if 60 thousand is exact (6.0 x10^4). So two significant digits.\n\nThen time is 50 seconds, which is one significant digit or two? Written as 50 seconds, ambiguous. But in scientific writing, 50 is likely two significant digits.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be two or one sig fig? If time is correctly given as two sig figs, then distance should be two as well.\n\n v=6.0 x10^4 km/s,\n\ntime in Galaxy’s frame= γ*50 s=$(6.0 x10^4)*(50)*(1.0206)=3,061,800 km≈3.1x10^6 km if two sig figs. But Gamma only has 1.02 at three sig: given that V is 60,000 km/s with two sig figs, so Gamma: sqrt(1-v²/c²).\n\nBut if v=60,000 km/s has two sig figs, then Gamma and the answer, 3,061,800 km should be also in two sig figs, so 3.1 million km. But in the computation, gamma is 1.0206, which is close to 1.02 (three sig figs), but if v is 6.0x10^4 (two sig dig), beta=0.20 (two sig dig) then gamma=1.02062, but unrounded when keeping:\n\nExercise precision: each step preserving.\n\nImo, since the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s which is two significant digits, and 50 seconds is two as well. Then, giving answer as two significant figures: 3.1 million km. Wait but how. Hmm, 3,061,862 approximate 3.06 million, which technically three sig. But beta was given as 0.2, if velocity is exactly 0.2 , then exact then would we can have gamma ? But problem states velocity as 60,000 km/s. If 60,000 is accurately perceived, may be more. But depending on cultural factors. For example, in contests like International Olympiad, if the problem says 60,000, by default it\'s treated as exactly 60,000 (5 s.f.). But in this case, express 60 thousand km/s is either 1 or 2 significant figures. But "sixty thousand km/s" in words, usually assuming the number of zeros are not significant, so two s.f. But set in the stated problem. Alternatively may assume as exact.\n\nBut, all this considered, the answer is around 3,061,862 km, that is, approximately 3.06 million km, so putting box \\\\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km}} would likely be acceptable. Alternatively, in the more precise in exponentials, 3.06 x10^6, as recommended.\n\nWait, but the problem says "part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy." In the Earth\'s perspective, that galaxy center is around 8 kpc away, but they say to ignore gravity and rotation. So just in local inertial frame.\n\nBut either way, correct approach is by multiplying velocity in Galaxy\'s frame v=0.2c by time in Galaxy\'s frame, which gamma time 50 sec. So x= v gamma t\'\n\nHence, using the gamma approximately 1.0206. Then x= 60,000*51.031 to get 3.06 million km.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ejecta travels approximately \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743845614, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5181, prompt_tokens=1553, total_tokens=6734, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Given that a supernova ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s (0.2c) in the Galaxy's reference frame, we need to determine the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

1. **Relate the time in the Galaxy's frame using time dilation**:
   - The Lorentz factor (γ) is calculated as:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
     \]
   - The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (Δt) is:
     \[
     \Delta t = \gamma \times \Delta t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.031 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame**:
   - The distance (D) is given by the product of velocity (v) and time (Δt) in the Galaxy's frame:
     \[
     D = v \times \Delta t = 60,000 \text{ km/s} \times 51.031 \text{ s} \approx 3,061,860 \text{ km}
     \]

Thus, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame is approximately \(\boxed{3.06 \times 10^6}\) kilometers.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

,0 km/s? Wait, 0.2*3e5 km/s = 6e4 km/s, which is 60,000 km/s. But that matches the initial velocity.

So then 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km.

Wait, compute that:

50 seconds would be 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km,

so 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,000,000 + 60,000 *1.03 = 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

But that seems. Wait, but is this approach right?

Alternatively, think in terms of Lorentz transformations. When events happen at the same place in S', the coordinates in S can be found using:

Δt = γ(Δt' + (vΔx')/c² )

But since Δx' = 0 (since it's the same location in S'), so Δt = γΔt'

Therefore, Δt = γΔt', so the time elapsed in S is γ times the proper time in S'. Therefore, the calculation above is correct. So the time in the Galaxy frame is gamma times 50 seconds.

So distance is v * gamma * delta t’ = 0.2c * 1.0206 *50 ≈ 0.2c*51.03 as above.

But is there another perspective?

Alternatively, perhaps using the length contraction formula? Although in this case, maybe not. Let's see.

Wait, length contraction is about the length of an object measured in different frames, but here we are measuring a distance that the object travels. So it's more about velocity and time.

Wait, but the velocity addition formula? But in this case, it's straightforward as the velocity is given as 0.2c in both frames. Because each frame is moving at 0.2c relative to the other. That seems inconsistent? Wait, no, in special relativity, if S' is moving at velocity u relative to S, then S is moving at velocity -u relative to S'. But velocity addition applies when considering a third object. But the problem doesn't have a third object.

So galaxy and ejecta are the two frames. Since the problem states both are inertial, and so the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the galaxy center in the galaxy frame, and vice versa. So the other than time dilation and length contraction, not sure what the issue is.

Wait, but here, in the galaxy frame, the time is longer due to gamma. So, what's matching is v * t = 0.2c * gamma * t’. That gives us the “naive” velocity multiplied by the time in the other frame.

Wait, but according to relativity, shouldn't the velocity of the Galaxy's center as measured in ejecta’s frame (0.2c) lead to a different velocity of the ejecta in Galaxy's frame? Wait, relative velocity should just be the same. Wait, can the velocity of S' frame (ejecta) seen from S (Galaxy) be the same as velocity of S seen from S'? According to Newtonian mechanics, it's just the negative. But in relativistiv addition?

Wait, actually in special relativity, the relative speed between frames is the same in both frames, A and B each see the other moving at speed v. So, if S' is moving at speed v in S, then S is moving at speed v in the opposite direction in S'.

But it's only when adding velocities of other objects that relativistic effects come in. So if in S, the Galaxy center is stationary, and the ejecta is moving at speed v towards it.

In S', ejecta is stationary, and Galaxy is moving towards it at speed v. So as per the problem statement.

Therefore velocity v is same, in opposite direction. Therefore, it seems the problem can be treated with time dilation. Therefore, proceed initial calculation.

So v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s.

Then, gamma ≈ 1.0206.

So, t = gamma * t' ≈ 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03sec.

Distance in Galaxy frame:D = v*t = 60,000 km/s *51.03s ≈3,061,800 km. Rounded to five significant figures, approx 3,061,800 km, but maybe keeping more accurately.

Wait γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

sqrt(0.96) is since 0.98^2 = 0.9604. So since 0.9604 is just a bit larger than 0.96, so sqrt(0.96)= approx 0.9798. Let me compute.

If precise value, sqrt(1 - 0.04)=sqrt(1 - x)=1 - x/2 - x²/8 + ... approx. But quadratic approximation:

sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(1 - 0.04)=1 - 0.04/2 - (0.04)^2/(8)=1 -0.02 -0.00016=0.97984. So yes, 0.97984, therefore gamma =1/0.97984≈1.02062.

So Δt=1.02062*50≈51.031 seconds.

Then D=60,000 km/s*51.031 s=60,000*(50 +1.031)=3,000,000 +60,000*1.031.

60,000*1= 60,000, 60,000*0.031=1860. Thus 60,000*1.031=61,860. So total distance=3,000,000+61,860=3,061,860 km.

Hmm. So approx 3.06186 ×10^6 km.

But the problem says, "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame".

Therefore, the answer would be approximately 3.06 million km. But let me check with exact formula.

Express gamma exactly: gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²))), where v=0.2c hence (v/c)=0.2.

So gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(1/0.96)=sqrt(25/24)=5/(2*sqrt(6))≈5/(4.89898)≈1.02062.

Yes, so.

Therefore D= v * t =v * gamma t'= 0.2c * gamma *50.

Compute 0.2c is as above 60000 km/s.

So D=60000*gamma*50.

Substitute gamma=1.02062. Then:

But compute 50 seconds or not. Let's compute:

D=60,000 km/s * 1.02062 *50s=60,000 *51.031=3,061,860 km.

But often, in problems like this, you use exact fractions when possible. Since gamma is 5/(2 sqrt(6)), which is equal to 5/(2*sqrt(6)). Let's check.

v=0.2c, so time in Galaxy frame is  gamma*50. So, Distance =0.2c * 50 *gamma. Given that sqrt(24)=2*sqrt(6), so maybe the answer can expressed in terms of exact. But not sure. Alternatively, is the answer just 60,000 km/s multiplied by 51.031 seconds... uh, 0.2c =60,000 km/sec.

But this result seems okay.

But wait a second. Let me pause. Is that really the answer?

In other words, according to the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and the time that passed is 51.031 seconds (thus turned from 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame). Multiply velocity with time gives 3.06 million km.

But if time ran slower in the ejecta's frame compared to Galaxy's frame. So in order to have events that take 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, more time passes in the Galaxy's frame? Then Galaxy's frame thinks that 51 seconds passed? Thus, the ejecta moves over 51 seconds *0.2c, which is more than 10 light seconds?

Wait, 0.2c is 60000 km/s, which is 60,000 per second. So in 50 seconds, it's 3 million km. But with gamma factor of ~1.02, adds another ~60,00 thousand km, making it 3.06 million.

But is that correct? Let's think in terms of muons. Muons have a longer lifetime in Earth frame, thus moving further. Similarly, here, since ejecta is moving, the proper time it experiences is less, so in Galaxy's frame, time is longer. Hence, more time passes, ejecta moves further.

Yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, to check the answer perhaps via another route: using invariant spacetime interval.

The spacetime interval between two events (the starting and ending of the timer on the ejecta) is:

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the two events are at same position, dx'=0, and dt'=50 s. So interval ds^2 = c^2 dt'^2.

In Galaxy's frame (S), the spacetime interval is ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2.

Since interval is invariant:

c²dt'² = c²dt² - dx²

Divide both sides by c²:

dt'^2 = dt^2 - (dx/c)^2.

But dx = v dt.

Therefore:

dt'^2 = dt² - (v² dt²)/c²

Then:

dt'^2= dt² (1 - v²/c²)

Therefore, dt = dt' / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = gamma dt', which reinforces earlier result.

Thus,

x = v dt = gamma v dt'.

Hence, present result is precise.

But perhaps compute x numerically:

x = v * gamma * dt' = (0.2c) * gamma *50 =0.2*(3e5 km/s)*(1/sqrt(1 -0.04))*50 s

=0.2*3e5*50 / sqrt(0.96).

Compute numerator: 0.2 *3e5 =6e4; 6e4*50=3e6.

So numerator is 3e6 / sqrt(0.96).

sqrt(0.96)= about 0.9798 as above, hence 3e6 /0.9798 ≈3,062,000 km. Therefore, same as before.

Therefore, x≈3,062,000 km.

Alternatively, precise calculation:

Let's compute 0.96 under the square root precisely via calculator.

√0.96:

Using calculator sqrt(0.96)= approximately 0.9797958976.

But let's not use explicit calculator steps. Let's do:

Approximate 0.9797958976.

Then 3,000,000 /0.9797958976=?

0.9797958976*3,000,000=2,939,387.693 divide by again.

Wait, rather, x=3e6 /0.9797958976≈3,061,862 km.

Yes, rounding to about 3,061,862 kilometers. But since significant digits? The velocity given is 60,000 km/s, which is two significant figures? Wait, actually 60,000 is given as "sixty thousand km/s"—if written as 60,000, the trailing zeros can be ambiguous, but if specified with the words, maybe we can assume it's precise? Wait, also common that when dealing with high velocities in astronomy, numbers can be precise but presented as rounded. However, in any case, if v is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c, and gamma was calculated as ~1.0206, leading to~3.06 million km. So, probable answer: Approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

But need to check the units and all again.

Wait, the given velocity is 60,000 km/s, so perhaps more precise if I multiply 60,000 with 1.02062 and multiply by 50? Wait, I had it the other way. Velocity is 60,000 km/s (from Galaxy frame's point of view, which is same as per calculation). Time in Galaxy frame is gamma *50 sec. So distance is 60,000 km/s * gamma *50. So.

gamma is approximately1.0206, so x=60,000 *50 *1.0206.

First, 60,000*50=3,000,000, then 3,000,000*1.0206=3,061,800. Therefore x=3,061,800 km. If I use more exact gamma=1.020620726, multiply 3,000,000: 3,000,000*1.020620726=3,000,000+3,000,000*0.020620726=3,000,000+61,862.178≈3,061,862.178 km. Which is about 3,061,862 km as before.

If the problem wants an exact answer in Boxed notation. But how significant digits? Velocity was given as 60,000, which is either one or two or more. But mostly considering 60,000 in the standard "three thousand" as exact, so 3.06 million km specified.

Alternatively, exact calculation with v=0.2c. Let’s do it:

Distance=0.2c* gamma*50. Since gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2)=1/sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(25/24)/sqrt(0.96)=?

Wait, exp(x)=1/sqrt(0.96)=sqrt(1/0.96)=sqrt(100/96)=sqrt(25/24)=5/(2*sqrt(6)).

Hmm, exact as 5/(2√6). Then Distance= 0.2c *50*5/(2√6)= (0.2*50*5)c/(2√6)= (50*5)c/(10√6)= (25c)/(10√6)= (5c)/(2√6))≈5*300,000/(2*2.449)≈1,500,000/4.898≈306,200 km? Wait, hmm, large maybe.

Wait, perhaps my algebraic step was:

 v is 0.2c, then velocity= 0.2 c.

gamma=5/(2 sqrt(6)) as derived above, yeah.

Distance= v * gamma *t'.

v=0.2c.

gamma=5/(2 sqrt(6))

t'=50.

Therefore, Distance= 0.2c *5/(2 sqrt(6)) *50=0.2*5*50/(2 sqrt(6)) *c= (50/sqrt(6))*c.

Wait that would be converting that:

0.2 *5=1, divide by 2=0.5.

0.5*50=25. So 25/sqrt(6)*c in some unit... Wait wait, hold on:

Wait, caulculate step by step:

0.2*5=1.

So 0.2c*5/(2 sqrt(6))*50. 0.2c *5 is 1 c, then over (2 sqrt(6))*50.

Wait: Let me retry:

Distance= 0.2c * gamma * 50. Since gamma=5/(2*sqrt(6)), then the equation becomes:

Distance=0.2c * [5/(2*sqrt(6))] *50= 0.2 *5*50/(2*sqrt(6))*(c).

Multiply numerator: 0.2*5=1; 1*50=50.

Denominator: 2*sqrt(6). Therefore:

50/(2*sqrt(6))=25/sqrt(6).

So distance=25/sqrt(6) * c.

But in this algebraic step, c can be in km/s.

Wait, c is in km/s (3e5 km/s). So Distance=25 / sqrt(6) *c≈25/2.449*3e5≈10.206*3e5≈3,061,800 km.

Therefore, exact expression is 25/sqrt(6) *c, close to 3.06 million km.

Thus answer is about 3,061,862 km.

But written in Boxed notation. Whether to use integer, or which decimal precision. If problem wants exact arithmetic, use in the box as \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}} or with precise value 3,062,000 km... Hmmm. Alternatively, to check whether there is calculator work...

Given that answer How precise. Depending upon the official answer's indicating.

But perhaps the intended answer in the problem is 3,000,000 km ± , but considering the velocity is given at 60,000 km/s, so exact answer≈50 *60,000=3,000,000 km, but then they want lhs top mention the relativistic shift. Hmm.

Wait in high school physics at times, if velocities are not as high, the difference is neglected. When v is 0.2c, which is 20% of light speed, relativistic effects are moderate but not negligible. Because gamma is squareroot(1 -0.04) invernse, which results in 1.0206. So only 2% time dilation. So distance is 2% greater than 3 million km. So the answer would be around 3.06 million km.

But maybe problem gives both in numbers. Should I present using exact values?

Converting 25/sqrt(6)*c.

Compute 25/sqrt(6):

First, sqrt(6)=2.449489743.

25/2.449489743≈10.206207.

Nevertheless, 10.206207*3e5 km=10.206207*300,000 km=3,061,862.1 km.

So exact answer≈3,061,862 km, approximately 3.062 million km.

In summary, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. So, boxed as \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}} or if integer, maybe \boxed{3061860 \text{ km}} though that feels excessively precise.

Alternatively, in the problem statement, given number at two significant figures, velocity is 60,000 km/s (could be taken as one significant digit, but more likely 2, if 60 thousand is exact (6.0 x10^4). So two significant digits.

Then time is 50 seconds, which is one significant digit or two? Written as 50 seconds, ambiguous. But in scientific writing, 50 is likely two significant digits.

Given that, the answer would be two or one sig fig? If time is correctly given as two sig figs, then distance should be two as well.

 v=6.0 x10^4 km/s,

time in Galaxy’s frame= γ*50 s=$(6.0 x10^4)*(50)*(1.0206)=3,061,800 km≈3.1x10^6 km if two sig figs. But Gamma only has 1.02 at three sig: given that V is 60,000 km/s with two sig figs, so Gamma: sqrt(1-v²/c²).

But if v=60,000 km/s has two sig figs, then Gamma and the answer, 3,061,800 km should be also in two sig figs, so 3.1 million km. But in the computation, gamma is 1.0206, which is close to 1.02 (three sig figs), but if v is 6.0x10^4 (two sig dig), beta=0.20 (two sig dig) then gamma=1.02062, but unrounded when keeping:

Exercise precision: each step preserving.

Imo, since the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s which is two significant digits, and 50 seconds is two as well. Then, giving answer as two significant figures: 3.1 million km. Wait but how. Hmm, 3,061,862 approximate 3.06 million, which technically three sig. But beta was given as 0.2, if velocity is exactly 0.2 , then exact then would we can have gamma ? But problem states velocity as 60,000 km/s. If 60,000 is accurately perceived, may be more. But depending on cultural factors. For example, in contests like International Olympiad, if the problem says 60,000, by default it's treated as exactly 60,000 (5 s.f.). But in this case, express 60 thousand km/s is either 1 or 2 significant figures. But "sixty thousand km/s" in words, usually assuming the number of zeros are not significant, so two s.f. But set in the stated problem. Alternatively may assume as exact.

But, all this considered, the answer is around 3,061,862 km, that is, approximately 3.06 million km, so putting box \\boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}} would likely be acceptable. Alternatively, in the more precise in exponentials, 3.06 x10^6, as recommended.

Wait, but the problem says "part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy." In the Earth's perspective, that galaxy center is around 8 kpc away, but they say to ignore gravity and rotation. So just in local inertial frame.

But either way, correct approach is by multiplying velocity in Galaxy's frame v=0.2c by time in Galaxy's frame, which gamma time 50 sec. So x= v gamma t'

Hence, using the gamma approximately 1.0206. Then x= 60,000*51.031 to get 3.06 million km.

**Final Answer**
The ejecta travels approximately \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.

However, since the problem involves events happening at different places in different frames, perhaps I need to use Lorentz transformations. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, from the ejecta\'s perspective, the Galactic center is moving towards them at 0.2c. The time for the Galactic center to meet the ejecta would be shorter due to length contraction. Wait, maybe it\'s more straightforward. Let me set up coordinates properly.\n\nLet S be the Galaxy frame, and S\' be the ejecta frame moving at velocity v = 0.2c relative to S (toward Galactic center, so direction is opposite if we take positive direction). The galactic center is moving toward the ejecta at speed 0.2c in S\'. So the position of the galactic center in S\' is at x\'= -d at t\'=0, and approaches the ejecta at x\'=0 over time. Therefore, the time until collision, from the ejecta\'s perspective, would be t\' = d/(0.2c). But here the question is slightly different; how much distance does the ejecta cover in S when 50 seconds pass in S\'.\n\nIn other words, we have to find the distance as measured in S between the two events: (1) ejecta at t\'=0, and (2) ejecta at t\'=50 seconds. Since in S\', the ejecta is stationary, while in S, it is moving at 0.2c. However, due to the relativity of simultaneity, we can\'t simply use v*t\', because the time coordinates are different.\n\nWait, maybe this requires Lorentz transformation. Let me compute the coordinates. Let the two events be:\n\nEvent 1: In S\', coordinates (t\', x\') = (0, 0) (ejecta at rest at origin of S\'; galactic center is at some x\' coordinate but approaching).\n\nEvent 2: In S\', (50 s, 0) since ejecta hasn\'t moved in S\'. Now, convert these events to S frame.\n\nUsing Lorentz transformation:\n\nt = γ(t\' + (v x\')/c²)\n\nBut x\' = 0 for both events. So t = γ t\'\n\nSo for Event 1: t1 = γ*0 = 0 (matches S frame at t=0)\nFor Event 2: t2 = γ*50 s ≈ 1.0206*50 ≈ 51.03 s, same as before.\n\nBut also, x = γ(x\' + v t\') = γ(0 + 0.2c * 50 s) since v is 0.2c, but need to be careful with velocity direction. Let me confirm the sign.\n\nIf the S\' frame (ejecta) is moving at velocity v = -0.2c with respect to S (galactic frame), right? Because from the galaxy\'s frame (S), ejecta moves toward the center (negative direction), and from ejecta\'s frame, galaxy center approaches at 0.2c. So in the standard setup, if S\' is moving at v velocity relative to S, then if S\' moves at v = -0.2c (toward the galactic center), so in S\', the origin of S is moving at +0.2c (assuming the coordinates are aligned such that positive x is from ejecta toward galactic center in the Galaxy\'s frame).\n\nWait, maybe an axis choice clarification. Let\'s assume in Galaxy frame (S), the positive x direction is from Galactic center towards the ejecta. But the ejecta is moving towards the center (negative x-direction). But from the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), the Galactic center is approaching at 0.2c in the positive x\' direction. Hmm, to avoid confusion, let\'s define:\n\nIn S (Galaxy frame): the ejecta is at origin (x=0) at t=0, moving toward negative x-direction (toward Galactic center at some other position). In S\', the ejecta is stationary, and the Galactic center is moving toward it at 0.2c in the positive x direction. Wait, no— If the galaxy frame S has the ejecta moving toward the center (negative x direction), then the ejecta\'s frame S\' is moving at velocity v = -0.2c with respect to S.\n\nThen, in S\', the galaxy\'s center is moving toward positive x\' direction? Hmm, perhaps using Lorentz transformation with v as velocity of S\' in S. Wait, the velocity of S\' (ejecta) according to S (Galaxy) is v = -0.2c (toward the center). Therefore, in S\', the velocity of S (Galaxy) is +0.2c.\n\nTherefore, for events:\n\nEvent 1: In S, x1 = 0 at t = 0.\nIn S\', corresponds to t\' = γ(t - vx/c²) = γ(0 - (-0.2c)(0)/c²) = 0, x\' = γ(x - vt) = γ(0 - (-0.2c)(0)) = 0.\n\nEvent 2: In S\', the event is at t\' = 50 s, x\' = 0.\n\nConvert to S coordinates:\n\nt2 = γ(t\' + (v x\') / c²) = γ(50 + (-0.2c)(0)/c²) = γ*50 ≈ 51.03 s\n\nx2 = γ(x\' + v t\') = γ(0 + (-0.2c)(50 s)) = γ*(-0.2c * 50)\n\nSo, x2 in S is γ*(-0.2*300,000 km/s * 50 s) = γ*(-3,000,000 km)\n\nBut need to check units: 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So:\n\nx2 = γ*(v t\') = γ*( -60,000 km/s * 50 s ) = γ*(-3,000,000 km)\n\nBut since we are in the S frame, and v is negative (movement toward negative x), so x2 = -γ*3,000,000 km. The distance traveled would be the magnitude from x=0 to x=-γ*3,000,000 km. However, but here time in S is γ*50 s, so under classical physics, it would be v*t = -60,000*51.03 ≈ -3,061,800 km, but here using Lorentz transformation, with γ multiplying. So x2 is -1.0206*3,000,000 ≈ -3,061,800 km. So the ejecta traveled 3,061,800 km in the negative x-direction towards the Galactic center. Therefore, answer ≈ 3,061,800 km. So approximately 3.06 x 10^6 km.\n\nWait, but according to Lorentz transformation, distance is x2 - x1 = x2 - 0 = x2, so displacement is -3,061,800 km, which is 3,061,800 km towards the center. So that would be the actual distance.\n\nBut let\'s see alternative way. Alternatively, in S, time is 51.03 seconds. So displacement is velocity * time: 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. This matches. So here using gamma over time dilation is valid because the two events (the ejecta at t\'=0 and t\'=50s) occur at same place in S\' (proper time). So the time in S is indeed dilated by gamma. Therefore distance is v * t_S = 0.2c * gamma * t\' = v * t_S.\n\nThat seems correct. The consideration when there is movement in different frames. So the answer is 0.2c * gamma * t\'.\n\nBut wait let\'s do the calculation properly. Is v = 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c, yes. Gamma is approximately 1.0206. So t_S = gamma*t\' = 1.0206*50 ≈ 51.03 s. Then distance would be v * t_S ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.  So about 3,061,800 km. In scientific notation, about 3.06 million kilometers.\n\nAlternatively, would be 3.06×10^6 km, which is approximately the same. But perhaps more precise.\n\nBut let me verify the units:\n\n60,000 km/s * 1.0206*50 s = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. That\'s correct. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3,061,800 kilometers.\n\nBut need to check again why we multiplied by gamma. Because from the Galaxy frame, time between the two events (ejecta clock ticking 50 seconds) is longer than in the ejecta\'s frame. Since the ejecta is moving, even though in its own frame, it\'s stationary, so moving 50 seconds in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy frame would experience 50 * gamma seconds. Therefore, when the ejecta\'s watch reads 50 seconds have passed, in the Galaxy frame 51.03 seconds have passed, and during that time, the ejecta, moving at 0.2c, travels approx 0.2*300,000*51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. That\'s consistent.\n\nBut hold on, wait. But when using Lorentz transformation, we also considered that, and got the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be approximately 3.06 million kilometers, or 3.06×10^6 km.\n\nCheck units: v=60,000 km/s = 6×10^4 km/s. Time in Galaxy frame: ~51 seconds.\n\nMultiply: 6×10^4 km/s * 51 s = 3.06×10^6 km. Yes. So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, box the answer as approximately that. But given that the problem specifies "what distance", the precise calculation would be:\n\nv = 60,000 km/s,\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nThen t = γ * 50 s ≈ 1.020620726*50 ≈51.0310363 s.\n\nDistance = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000*51.0310363 ≈ 3,061,862.18 km.\n\nBut depending on precision needed. If we consider precise calculation with sqrt(0.96), but perhaps rounded to nearest hundred or so? The speed was given with 2 significant figures (60,000 km/s), but likely has two significant figures (since 60,000 could be ambiguous, but perhaps as written, all zeros are placeholders. However, if it\'s exact 60,000 (maybe 6x10^4), then after multiplying by 51.03, but perhaps we should include about 3.06e6 km.\n\nBut let\'s check again. Using exact gamma:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\ndelta_t = 50 s, so t = 51.0310363s.\n\ndistance: 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 * 51.0310 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km.\n\nIf rounded to three decimal places—but the problem didn\'t specify decimal precision, but probably expects a simplified answer. Let me check how precise the numbers are.\n\nThe given velocity is 60,000 km/s (two significant figures? 6 and the next digit is 0, but might be ambiguous). If only two significant figures, then the answer should be rounded to 3.1 x10^6 km. However, sometimes if a number is given with trailing zeros without a decimal, like 60,000, maybe it\'s considered as one significant figure (though maybe as five), but I think in usual conventions, here indicated as 60,000 km/s might mean two significant digits (if people write it in scientific notation as 6.0x10^4 km/s it\'s two sig figs), so as given, likely two significant figures, then the answer would need to be 3.1x10^6 km. But let me verify.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, 60,000 is written as 60 000 km/s (with a space). So probably exact value (five significant figures), given as 60000 implies uncertainty? However, without additional info, maybe in astronomy, if given even 60,000 km/s, considering the approximated values. But 60,000 km/s is the speed as per the problem statement, so using 60,000 exactly. Then gamma can be calculated with higher precision.\n\nBut given that, checking:\n\ngamma=1/sqrt(1 - 0.2^2)=1/sqrt(0.96)=approx1.020620726\n\nMultiply by 50: 51.0310363\n\nMultiply by 60,000: 51.0310363*60,000=\n\nCompute 50 *60,000=3,000,000\n\n1.0310363 *60,000=61,862.178\n\nTotal: 3,000,000 +61,862.178=3,061,862.178 km\n\nSo exactly 3,061,862.178 km. So the accurate calculation gives this. Then perhaps the problem expects it expressed as 3.06 x10^6 km (three significant figures). But we need to check—do we have more?\n\nWait original inputs:\n\nVelocity is 60,000 km/s (probably two significant figures—since if it were exact, it would be 60,000. or written with a decimal). So they say moving at 60 000 km/s.\n\nGiven the answer options in typical exams, sometimes round to three significant figures. Perhaps boxed answer is proposed with three sig figs. So 3.06×10^6 km. Alternatively,  as three figures:\n\n3,060,000 km?\n\nBut given the precise calculation is 3,061,862 km, maybe rounding to three significant digits gives 3.06*10^6.\n\nHmm, in conclusion, 3.06 million kilometers—so \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km}}.\n\nBut double-check if speed/time might be involved with another method, but given corrections, this seems accurate.\n\nEarlier, I thought maybe applying length contraction. Alternatively, considering from the ejecta\'s frame, the distance to the center is contracted, but we’re not given the proper distance in Galaxy\'s frame.\n\nWait, but perhaps in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta moves at 0.2c for 51.03 seconds. Thus, distance is speed * time, as calculated. So this method is correct. Therefore, the answer would unambiguously be approximately 3.06 million km.\n\nYeah, seems right.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743845843, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3660, prompt_tokens=531, total_tokens=4191, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, we need to account for relativistic time dilation. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Relative Velocity**: The ejecta and the Galaxy are moving towards each other at a velocity of \( v = 0.2c \) (60,000 km/s).

2. **Time Dilation**: The proper time in the ejecta's frame (\( \Delta t' = 50 \) seconds) is related to the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( \Delta t \)) by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

3. **Calculate \( \gamma \)**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

4. **Time in Galaxy's Frame**:
   \[
   \Delta t \approx 1.0206 \times 50 \, \text{s} \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

5. **Distance Traveled**: In the Galaxy's frame, the distance is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \times \Delta t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]

**Final Answer**:

 ≈ 30,000 km/s × 51.03 s ≈ 1,530,900 km

But wait, another approach might be length contraction. However, since the problem involves events happening at different places in different frames, perhaps I need to use Lorentz transformations. Let me think again.

Alternatively, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galactic center is moving towards them at 0.2c. The time for the Galactic center to meet the ejecta would be shorter due to length contraction. Wait, maybe it's more straightforward. Let me set up coordinates properly.

Let S be the Galaxy frame, and S' be the ejecta frame moving at velocity v = 0.2c relative to S (toward Galactic center, so direction is opposite if we take positive direction). The galactic center is moving toward the ejecta at speed 0.2c in S'. So the position of the galactic center in S' is at x'= -d at t'=0, and approaches the ejecta at x'=0 over time. Therefore, the time until collision, from the ejecta's perspective, would be t' = d/(0.2c). But here the question is slightly different; how much distance does the ejecta cover in S when 50 seconds pass in S'.

In other words, we have to find the distance as measured in S between the two events: (1) ejecta at t'=0, and (2) ejecta at t'=50 seconds. Since in S', the ejecta is stationary, while in S, it is moving at 0.2c. However, due to the relativity of simultaneity, we can't simply use v*t', because the time coordinates are different.

Wait, maybe this requires Lorentz transformation. Let me compute the coordinates. Let the two events be:

Event 1: In S', coordinates (t', x') = (0, 0) (ejecta at rest at origin of S'; galactic center is at some x' coordinate but approaching).

Event 2: In S', (50 s, 0) since ejecta hasn't moved in S'. Now, convert these events to S frame.

Using Lorentz transformation:

t = γ(t' + (v x')/c²)

But x' = 0 for both events. So t = γ t'

So for Event 1: t1 = γ*0 = 0 (matches S frame at t=0)
For Event 2: t2 = γ*50 s ≈ 1.0206*50 ≈ 51.03 s, same as before.

But also, x = γ(x' + v t') = γ(0 + 0.2c * 50 s) since v is 0.2c, but need to be careful with velocity direction. Let me confirm the sign.

If the S' frame (ejecta) is moving at velocity v = -0.2c with respect to S (galactic frame), right? Because from the galaxy's frame (S), ejecta moves toward the center (negative direction), and from ejecta's frame, galaxy center approaches at 0.2c. So in the standard setup, if S' is moving at v velocity relative to S, then if S' moves at v = -0.2c (toward the galactic center), so in S', the origin of S is moving at +0.2c (assuming the coordinates are aligned such that positive x is from ejecta toward galactic center in the Galaxy's frame).

Wait, maybe an axis choice clarification. Let's assume in Galaxy frame (S), the positive x direction is from Galactic center towards the ejecta. But the ejecta is moving towards the center (negative x-direction). But from the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galactic center is approaching at 0.2c in the positive x' direction. Hmm, to avoid confusion, let's define:

In S (Galaxy frame): the ejecta is at origin (x=0) at t=0, moving toward negative x-direction (toward Galactic center at some other position). In S', the ejecta is stationary, and the Galactic center is moving toward it at 0.2c in the positive x direction. Wait, no— If the galaxy frame S has the ejecta moving toward the center (negative x direction), then the ejecta's frame S' is moving at velocity v = -0.2c with respect to S.

Then, in S', the galaxy's center is moving toward positive x' direction? Hmm, perhaps using Lorentz transformation with v as velocity of S' in S. Wait, the velocity of S' (ejecta) according to S (Galaxy) is v = -0.2c (toward the center). Therefore, in S', the velocity of S (Galaxy) is +0.2c.

Therefore, for events:

Event 1: In S, x1 = 0 at t = 0.
In S', corresponds to t' = γ(t - vx/c²) = γ(0 - (-0.2c)(0)/c²) = 0, x' = γ(x - vt) = γ(0 - (-0.2c)(0)) = 0.

Event 2: In S', the event is at t' = 50 s, x' = 0.

Convert to S coordinates:

t2 = γ(t' + (v x') / c²) = γ(50 + (-0.2c)(0)/c²) = γ*50 ≈ 51.03 s

x2 = γ(x' + v t') = γ(0 + (-0.2c)(50 s)) = γ*(-0.2c * 50)

So, x2 in S is γ*(-0.2*300,000 km/s * 50 s) = γ*(-3,000,000 km)

But need to check units: 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So:

x2 = γ*(v t') = γ*( -60,000 km/s * 50 s ) = γ*(-3,000,000 km)

But since we are in the S frame, and v is negative (movement toward negative x), so x2 = -γ*3,000,000 km. The distance traveled would be the magnitude from x=0 to x=-γ*3,000,000 km. However, but here time in S is γ*50 s, so under classical physics, it would be v*t = -60,000*51.03 ≈ -3,061,800 km, but here using Lorentz transformation, with γ multiplying. So x2 is -1.0206*3,000,000 ≈ -3,061,800 km. So the ejecta traveled 3,061,800 km in the negative x-direction towards the Galactic center. Therefore, answer ≈ 3,061,800 km. So approximately 3.06 x 10^6 km.

Wait, but according to Lorentz transformation, distance is x2 - x1 = x2 - 0 = x2, so displacement is -3,061,800 km, which is 3,061,800 km towards the center. So that would be the actual distance.

But let's see alternative way. Alternatively, in S, time is 51.03 seconds. So displacement is velocity * time: 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. This matches. So here using gamma over time dilation is valid because the two events (the ejecta at t'=0 and t'=50s) occur at same place in S' (proper time). So the time in S is indeed dilated by gamma. Therefore distance is v * t_S = 0.2c * gamma * t' = v * t_S.

That seems correct. The consideration when there is movement in different frames. So the answer is 0.2c * gamma * t'.

But wait let's do the calculation properly. Is v = 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c, yes. Gamma is approximately 1.0206. So t_S = gamma*t' = 1.0206*50 ≈ 51.03 s. Then distance would be v * t_S ≈ 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.  So about 3,061,800 km. In scientific notation, about 3.06 million kilometers.

Alternatively, would be 3.06×10^6 km, which is approximately the same. But perhaps more precise.

But let me verify the units:

60,000 km/s * 1.0206*50 s = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. That's correct. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3,061,800 kilometers.

But need to check again why we multiplied by gamma. Because from the Galaxy frame, time between the two events (ejecta clock ticking 50 seconds) is longer than in the ejecta's frame. Since the ejecta is moving, even though in its own frame, it's stationary, so moving 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy frame would experience 50 * gamma seconds. Therefore, when the ejecta's watch reads 50 seconds have passed, in the Galaxy frame 51.03 seconds have passed, and during that time, the ejecta, moving at 0.2c, travels approx 0.2*300,000*51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. That's consistent.

But hold on, wait. But when using Lorentz transformation, we also considered that, and got the same result.

Therefore, the final answer should be approximately 3.06 million kilometers, or 3.06×10^6 km.

Check units: v=60,000 km/s = 6×10^4 km/s. Time in Galaxy frame: ~51 seconds.

Multiply: 6×10^4 km/s * 51 s = 3.06×10^6 km. Yes. So that's correct.

Therefore, box the answer as approximately that. But given that the problem specifies "what distance", the precise calculation would be:

v = 60,000 km/s,

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

Then t = γ * 50 s ≈ 1.020620726*50 ≈51.0310363 s.

Distance = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000*51.0310363 ≈ 3,061,862.18 km.

But depending on precision needed. If we consider precise calculation with sqrt(0.96), but perhaps rounded to nearest hundred or so? The speed was given with 2 significant figures (60,000 km/s), but likely has two significant figures (since 60,000 could be ambiguous, but perhaps as written, all zeros are placeholders. However, if it's exact 60,000 (maybe 6x10^4), then after multiplying by 51.03, but perhaps we should include about 3.06e6 km.

But let's check again. Using exact gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

delta_t = 50 s, so t = 51.0310363s.

distance: 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 * 51.0310 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km.

If rounded to three decimal places—but the problem didn't specify decimal precision, but probably expects a simplified answer. Let me check how precise the numbers are.

The given velocity is 60,000 km/s (two significant figures? 6 and the next digit is 0, but might be ambiguous). If only two significant figures, then the answer should be rounded to 3.1 x10^6 km. However, sometimes if a number is given with trailing zeros without a decimal, like 60,000, maybe it's considered as one significant figure (though maybe as five), but I think in usual conventions, here indicated as 60,000 km/s might mean two significant digits (if people write it in scientific notation as 6.0x10^4 km/s it's two sig figs), so as given, likely two significant figures, then the answer would need to be 3.1x10^6 km. But let me verify.

Wait, but in the problem statement, 60,000 is written as 60 000 km/s (with a space). So probably exact value (five significant figures), given as 60000 implies uncertainty? However, without additional info, maybe in astronomy, if given even 60,000 km/s, considering the approximated values. But 60,000 km/s is the speed as per the problem statement, so using 60,000 exactly. Then gamma can be calculated with higher precision.

But given that, checking:

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - 0.2^2)=1/sqrt(0.96)=approx1.020620726

Multiply by 50: 51.0310363

Multiply by 60,000: 51.0310363*60,000=

Compute 50 *60,000=3,000,000

1.0310363 *60,000=61,862.178

Total: 3,000,000 +61,862.178=3,061,862.178 km

So exactly 3,061,862.178 km. So the accurate calculation gives this. Then perhaps the problem expects it expressed as 3.06 x10^6 km (three significant figures). But we need to check—do we have more?

Wait original inputs:

Velocity is 60,000 km/s (probably two significant figures—since if it were exact, it would be 60,000. or written with a decimal). So they say moving at 60 000 km/s.

Given the answer options in typical exams, sometimes round to three significant figures. Perhaps boxed answer is proposed with three sig figs. So 3.06×10^6 km. Alternatively,  as three figures:

3,060,000 km?

But given the precise calculation is 3,061,862 km, maybe rounding to three significant digits gives 3.06*10^6.

Hmm, in conclusion, 3.06 million kilometers—so \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}}.

But double-check if speed/time might be involved with another method, but given corrections, this seems accurate.

Earlier, I thought maybe applying length contraction. Alternatively, considering from the ejecta's frame, the distance to the center is contracted, but we’re not given the proper distance in Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but perhaps in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at 0.2c for 51.03 seconds. Thus, distance is speed * time, as calculated. So this method is correct. Therefore, the answer would unambiguously be approximately 3.06 million km.

Yeah, seems right.

So, approximately 3.0618 x 10^6 km.\n\nBut wait, another approach: maybe apply Lorentz transformation directly, since handling coordinates.\n\nSo, in the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), the Galaxy center is moving towards it at v = -0.2c (assuming ejecta\'s frame S\' with origin at the ejecta). Then after time t\' = 50 s, the Galactic center has moved a distance x\' = v * t\' = -0.2c * 50 s (negative because moving toward ejecta at speed 0.2c). And then translate this via Lorentz transformation to S (Galaxy).\n\nBut in effect, S\' is moving at velocity v = 0.2c toward the Galactic center. Then to find the coordinates in S.\n\nSo, in S (Galaxy\'s frame): the ejecta is at x = 0 moving toward the Galactic center, so leaving some misalignment here perhaps.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps better to set up coordinates.\n\nLet’s set S as Galaxy’s reference frame. Let the ejecta move at velocity v = 0.2c towards the Galactic center. The ejecta\'s rest frame is S\', moving at v = 0.2c relative to S.\n\nIn S, after time t, the ejecta has moved x = v t. But the question is, when 50 seconds pass in S\', how much time passes in S, and thus, distance x in S can be calculated from that.\n\nGiven that they would need to do a Lorentz transformation. So proper time in S\' is 50 seconds. The time in S (Galaxy) would be γ t\', so already covered. Hence, the x would be v γ t\', which is gamma times v t\', so yes.\n\nTherefore, resulting in x = 0.2c * γ * 50. Since v = 0.2c ≈ 6 x 10^4 km/s.\n\nEarlier, with γ ≈ 1.0206, so x = 6e4 km/s * 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 6e4 * 51.03 ≈ 3.0618e6 km, which is around 3.06 million kilometers.\n\nAlternatively, handling in terms of Lorentz transformations. Let’s use Lorentz equations. The event in spacetime where the ejecta\'s clock shows 50 seconds would be (t\' = 50 s, x\' = 0), since the ejecta is stationary in S\'. Applying to S:\n\nt = γ(t\' + (v x\')/c² )\n\nBut wait, the Lorentz transformations are:\n\nIf S\' moves relative to S at velocity u along the x-axis, then coordinates (x, t) in S relate to (x\', t\') in S\' via:\n\nx = γ(x\' + u t\')\n\nt = γ(t\' + (u x\')/c² )\n\nBut in our case, if the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center (so perhaps S\' is moving at u = 0.2c as per Galaxy’s frame S, since the ejecta is moving towards the center in S). But actually, S\' here: if in the Galaxy frame, S, the ejecta moves at 0.2c towards center, then the ejecta’s rest frame S\' is moving at velocity v = 0.2c towards the center in S?\n\nWait, possibly coordinates: Let’s say in S (Galaxy center frame), the ejecta is moving in positive x-direction towards the center at velocity v = 0.2c. Then, the Lorentz boost from S to S\' (ejecta’s frame) would be with speed v = 0.2c. So, the coordinates in S\' related to S are:\n\nx\' = γ(x - v t)\n\nt\' = γ(t - (v x)/c² )\n\nThe question is: Let’s consider the event in S\' where t\' = 50 s and x\' = 0 (the ejecta\'s position). We need to find the coordinates in S, that is, when and where does this event happen.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = γ(x\' + v t\') maybe? Wait, possibly.\n\nHold on, in standard Lorentz transformations, going from S to S\', coordinates are:\n\nx\' = γ (x - v t)\n\nt\' = γ (t - v x /c² )\n\nTherefore, to reverse, from S\' to S, where S\' is moving at velocity v relative to S, the transformations would be:\n\nx = γ (x\' + v t\') <-- inverse transformation\n\nt = γ (t\' + v x\' / c² )\n\nIn our situation, we want to convert the event (x\'=0, t\'=50 s) in S\' to S:\n\nx = γ (0 + v * 50) = γ v * 50\n\nt = γ (50 + v * 0 / c² ) = γ * 50 s\n\nTherefore, the event in S is at position x = γ v t’, and t = γ t’.\n\nTherefore, in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta moves x = γ v t’ and this happens at time t = γ t’.\n\nTherefore, γ ≈1.0206, calculated before. So, x = 1.0206 * 0.2c * 50 , which is as before.\n\nSo yes, solving this way, x = gamma*v*t\', so the distance is ΓvT’, where Γ is gamma.\n\nSo, then, plugging in numbers: Gamma=1.0206, v=60,000 km/s, T’=50 s.\n\nThus, distance x = 1.0206 * 60,000 km/s * 50 s = roughly same as before, 1.0206*3,000,000 km = 3,061,800 km ≈ 3.06 x 10^6 km. Thus, the answer would be approximately 3.0618e6 kilometers.\n\nBut let me do more precise calculation with gamma.\n\nFirst, exact gamma calculation.\n\nv = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04.\n\nTherefore, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.04)) = 1/sqrt(0.96)\n\nsqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798 (since 0.9798² = approximately 0.96, since 0.98²=0.9604)\n\nBut let’s do accurate calculation:\n\nsqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(0.9604 - 0.0004) since 0.98²=0.9604, so sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(0.980^2 - (0.0004)) ≈ but perhaps not necessary. Use Taylor series approximation at x=0.04:\n\nsqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1 - (0.04)/2 - (0.04)^2/8 - ... ≈ 1 - 0.02 - 0.0002 = 0.9798.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator-like approach:\n\n√0.96.\n\nWell, maybe we can compute it better.\n\nLet sigma = 0.96. Let\'s square root. We can attempt linear approximation.\n\n√(1 - δ) ≈ 1 - δ/2 - δ²/8 - δ³/16 - ...\n\nfor δ = 0.04, so √0.96 ≈ 1 - 0.02 - 0.0004/ ( 8 represents (δ^2)/8 )?\n\nWait, hold on—it’s sigma = 1 - δ, δ=0.04. So, √sigma ≈ 1 - δ/2 - (δ²)/8 - (δ^3)/16...\n\nBut delta here is 0.04.\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈1 - 0.04/2 - (0.04)^2 / 8 ≈1 -0.02 -0.00016/8≈1-0.02 -0.00002=0.97998.\n\nWait, perhaps use exact value sqrt(24/25)=sqrt(24)/5≈4.89898/5=0.979796.\n\nSo, maybe exactly 0.979796.\n\nThus, gamma is 1/0.979796≈1.020620726.\n\nSo, gamma=1.020620726.\n\nThen, t = gamma *t\'=1.020620726 *50≈51.0310363 seconds.\n\nThen, x=vt=60, 000 km/s *51.0310363 s≈60,000 *51.0310363≈3,061,862.18 km≈3.06186218 × 10^6 km.\n\nThus, approximately 3.061862×10^6 km.\n\nLet me confirm if due care occurred with units. Given:\n\nv =0.2c, which indeed has to be 60,000 km/s as per the problem (with c=300,000 km/s), correct.\n\nIf the Galaxy perceives the ejecta approaching at 60,000 km/s, so according to Galaxy\'s frame, velocity is indeed 60,000 km/s. The event in the ejecta\'s frame is when its clock has counted 50 seconds, so we Lorentz transformed it to Galaxy\'s reference frame. So in the Galaxy\'s frame, that event (ejecta having its own clock at 50s) translates to the ejecta being located at x= gamma vt\' (from the previous calculation) and the time at t= gamma t\'.\n\nBut x (position of ejecta in Galaxy frame at t=gamma t\') = gamma v t\'\n\nSo yes, that distance is about 3.06 million km.\n\nHowever, necessary to validate if this approach is correct. For example, can we not consider the situation in another way? From the ejecta\'s frame, they measure 50 seconds, and during that time, the Galactic center moved towards them at 0.2c, reaching a total distance covered. Then, that distance might be, in ejecta\'s frame, (60,000 km/s)*50 s=3,000,000 km.\n\nHowever, in the Galaxy\'s frame, that same physical distance would be subject to length contraction? Wait, but the direction of motion is along the Galactic center moving towards the ejecta. Proper length and whatever. Wait, but if the ejecta measures a length contraction in the Galaxy\'s frame.\n\nBut for the distance between the ejecta and the Galactic center, perhaps use that length contraction happens in direction of motion. If in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, then at rest, the spatial separation might not be contracted, but since they are approaching each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not. Straightforward relativistic approach may be best. The first method focused on converting the even where the ejecta\'s own clock reads 50 seconds to Galactic frame using Lorentz transformation, where indeed x = gamma v t\', gives x≈ approx. 3.06 million km. But why not answer is just v * t? For low speeds, the Galilean answer is that in the Galaxy\'s frame, even if the time is higher? But since velocity is 0.2c, so may not be negligible.\n\nAlternatively, intuition fails here because time and space are references in each frame. Let’s consider if an observer on the ejecta argues that the Galactic center moves towards them at 0.2c, so in 50 seconds, 3 x 10^6 km. But in Galactic frame, it\'s the ejecta moving, so time for the same journey would prefer different times.\n\nWait, but in the Galactic frame, the time is gamma t\', so the distance covered by the ejecta is gamma t\' * v, which is gamma numerical factor (1.02). It\'s cumbersome, but it\'s due accounting for relativistic effects even if the speed is only 0.2c. The speed’s enough (sixty thousand km/s is two tenths of light speed) to require SR.\n\nIs 1.02 gamma sufficiently close to 1 to approximate it (depending on answer requirements)? The problem gives precise numbers, so definitely needs to include gamma.\n\nBut here, 1.02 indicates a 2% difference from coordinate time vs. proper time. Therefore, when you factor this in, you multiply 50 sec by 1.02 to get 51 sec in the Galaxy’s frame, and therefore, 60,000 km/s * 51 sec: 3,060,000 km. So approximately 3.06 x10^6 km.\n\nBut in terms of precise answer—— wait, "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"\n\nSo relativistic distance.\n\nLet me re-express the entire sequence with the exact steps.\n\nThe required formula was derived:\n\nx = γ v t\', with v = 0.2c, t\' =50 s, and γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)=1.020620726.\n\nTherefore, x =1.020620726*(0.2c)*50 s.\n\nHowever, 0.2c=60,000 km/s, so no need to convert c to km/s as it\'s already known. So:\n\n1.020620726 * 60,000 *50=1.020620726 *3,000,000 ≈3,061,862.18 km.\n\nThus, it\'s 3,061,862 km. The problem expects perhaps truncated to the nearest integer or precise value. So... If writing in calculator precise terms:\n\nMultiplications:\n\n1.020620726 * 60,000 = ?. Let me compute 60,000 multiplied in parts.\n\n60,000 × 1.020620726 = 61,237.24356.\n\nThus, 60,000 × 1.02 = 61,200.\n\n61,237.24356 per minute.\n\nMultiply by 50 seconds: 61,237.24356 km/s *50 s=3,061,862.178 km.\n\nThus, approximates to 3,061,862 km.\n\nHowever, problems generally wait in units. If expressing in km, it\'s of order million km.\n\nAlternatively, compare the answer derived through Lorentz transforms.\n\nAnother thought flow: the proper time is 50 seconds for the ejecta, so using space time interval.\n\nBut we are asked in the Galaxy\'s frame: space time concept.\n\nAlternatively, the invariant spacetime interval for the ejecta\'s journey...\n\nBetween two events: departure and arrival somewhere, but the proper time is measured by the ejecta\'s own clock, 50 seconds. The interval itself would be identical in every frame. However, coordinate distances would vary.\n\nBut s^2 = (c Δt\')^2 = (c Δt)^2 - (Δx)^2.\n\nBut in the Galaxy\'s frame, time elapsed is Δt, space is Δx = v Δt. That with TSR interval:\n\n(c Δt\')^2 = (c Δt)^2 - (v Δt )^2.\n\nThen, (c Δt\') = sqrt( (c Δt)^2 - (v Δt )^2 )\n\nThus, solving for Δt,\n\n(c Δt\') = Δt sqrt( c² -v² )\n\nΔt = c Δt\' / sqrt( c² - v² )\n\nBut squareroot(c² -v² )=c sqrt(1 -v²/c² ) So  delta t= c t\' / (c sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2 ))=t\'/sqrt(1 -v^ 2/c² )=gamma t\'. So same as before. So, this reproduction method gives the same expression for time in Galaxy\'s frame.\n\nThen, delta X= v delta t= v gamma t\'\n\nSame answer again. So confirm that irrespective of approach, the answer is v gamma t\'\n\nTherefore likely correct.\n\nSo generally, the answer is ≈3,061,862 km, approximately 3.06 million kilometers.\n\nGiven that precise calculation yields 3,061,862 kilometers, perhaps expressed more concisely. Alternatively, if permitted, in exponents: 3.06 x10^6 km. Given the problem inputs were two signifiant figures for velocity (60,000 km/s  is one significant figure?), wait.\n\nWait, speed is given as 60,000 km/s. Possibly two? Eg, the number 60,000 is 6 followed by 4 zeros. But not using decimal, but trailing zeros. Ambiguity arises. If it\'s defined as two significant figures (60,000 with the comma as a thousand separator), accurate to one or five significant figures? But most likely two figures: 60. Thousand. However, the problem states "60 000 km/s," if written with space separator instead of comma, in more European convention, with decimal comma; but regardless, in science, trailing zeros in figure with a number like 60000 is ambiguous unless a decimal is included. However, the note that velocity is 60 000 km/s is two significant digits if written with one significant digit, but approximate. Hmm this could perhaps introduce dependence, but since answer expects LaTeX, will just go with precise calculation.\n\nIf the problem\'s answer is given as a particular detailed number, perhaps using approximate numbers in the calculation. But if the problem is presented such that the relative velocity is exactly 0.2c (since 60,000 km/s is exactly 0.2*c, with c at exactly 300,000 km/s), then the answer becomes pure algebra.\n\nIf v = 0.2c, then gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 /sqrt(24/25) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) ; correction.\n\nWait 1 - (0.2c)^2 / c² = 1 - 0.04=0.96=24/25.\n\nThus, sqrt(24/25)= (2*sqrt(6))/5.\n\nThus, gamma=5/( 2 sqrt(6) ). Exactly.\n\nSo gamma=5/(2√6). So t=gamma t\'= (5/(2√6 )) *50=250/(2√6 )=125/(sqrt(6).\n\nDistance x= v t=0.2c *125/sqrt(6).\n\nCompute that:\n\nC=300,000 km/s⇒0.2c=60,000 km/s.\n\nHence, x=60000 *125/sqrt(6)=60000 *125 /2.449489743≈\n\nFirst, compute numerator:60000*125=7,500,000.\n\nDivide by sqrt(6)=7,500,000 /2.449489743≈3,061,862.178..., again the same as previous. So exact same value. So the precise answer.\n\nTherefore, in exact terms it\'s x=60,000 * (50 seconds) * (1/ sqrt(0.96)).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

Given a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s (0.2c), we need to determine the distance it travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame.

1. **Key Information**:
   - Velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame: \( v = 0.2c = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Proper time in the ejecta's frame: \( \Delta t' = 50 \, \text{seconds} \)

2. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:
   - The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
     \]
   - Coordinate time in the Galaxy's frame \( \Delta t \) is dilated:
     \[
     \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{seconds}
     \]

3. **Distance Traveled in Galaxy's Frame**:
   - Using the velocity and dilated time:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = v \times \Delta t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,862 \, \text{km}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The ejecta travels approximately \( 3.06 \times 10^6 \, \text{kilometers} \) in the Galaxy's reference frame.

### Final Answer
The ejecta travels approximately \(\boxed{3.06 \times 10^6}\) kilometers in the Galaxy's reference frame.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Hence, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s.

Calculating 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 60,000*50 = 3,000,000 and 60,000*1.03 = 61,800 → total of 3,061,800 km. So, approximately 3.0618 x 10^6 km.

But wait, another approach: maybe apply Lorentz transformation directly, since handling coordinates.

So, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy center is moving towards it at v = -0.2c (assuming ejecta's frame S' with origin at the ejecta). Then after time t' = 50 s, the Galactic center has moved a distance x' = v * t' = -0.2c * 50 s (negative because moving toward ejecta at speed 0.2c). And then translate this via Lorentz transformation to S (Galaxy).

But in effect, S' is moving at velocity v = 0.2c toward the Galactic center. Then to find the coordinates in S.

So, in S (Galaxy's frame): the ejecta is at x = 0 moving toward the Galactic center, so leaving some misalignment here perhaps.

Wait, wait, perhaps better to set up coordinates.

Let’s set S as Galaxy’s reference frame. Let the ejecta move at velocity v = 0.2c towards the Galactic center. The ejecta's rest frame is S', moving at v = 0.2c relative to S.

In S, after time t, the ejecta has moved x = v t. But the question is, when 50 seconds pass in S', how much time passes in S, and thus, distance x in S can be calculated from that.

Given that they would need to do a Lorentz transformation. So proper time in S' is 50 seconds. The time in S (Galaxy) would be γ t', so already covered. Hence, the x would be v γ t', which is gamma times v t', so yes.

Therefore, resulting in x = 0.2c * γ * 50. Since v = 0.2c ≈ 6 x 10^4 km/s.

Earlier, with γ ≈ 1.0206, so x = 6e4 km/s * 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 6e4 * 51.03 ≈ 3.0618e6 km, which is around 3.06 million kilometers.

Alternatively, handling in terms of Lorentz transformations. Let’s use Lorentz equations. The event in spacetime where the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds would be (t' = 50 s, x' = 0), since the ejecta is stationary in S'. Applying to S:

t = γ(t' + (v x')/c² )

But wait, the Lorentz transformations are:

If S' moves relative to S at velocity u along the x-axis, then coordinates (x, t) in S relate to (x', t') in S' via:

x = γ(x' + u t')

t = γ(t' + (u x')/c² )

But in our case, if the ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center (so perhaps S' is moving at u = 0.2c as per Galaxy’s frame S, since the ejecta is moving towards the center in S). But actually, S' here: if in the Galaxy frame, S, the ejecta moves at 0.2c towards center, then the ejecta’s rest frame S' is moving at velocity v = 0.2c towards the center in S?

Wait, possibly coordinates: Let’s say in S (Galaxy center frame), the ejecta is moving in positive x-direction towards the center at velocity v = 0.2c. Then, the Lorentz boost from S to S' (ejecta’s frame) would be with speed v = 0.2c. So, the coordinates in S' related to S are:

x' = γ(x - v t)

t' = γ(t - (v x)/c² )

The question is: Let’s consider the event in S' where t' = 50 s and x' = 0 (the ejecta's position). We need to find the coordinates in S, that is, when and where does this event happen.

Therefore,

x = γ(x' + v t') maybe? Wait, possibly.

Hold on, in standard Lorentz transformations, going from S to S', coordinates are:

x' = γ (x - v t)

t' = γ (t - v x /c² )

Therefore, to reverse, from S' to S, where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, the transformations would be:

x = γ (x' + v t') <-- inverse transformation

t = γ (t' + v x' / c² )

In our situation, we want to convert the event (x'=0, t'=50 s) in S' to S:

x = γ (0 + v * 50) = γ v * 50

t = γ (50 + v * 0 / c² ) = γ * 50 s

Therefore, the event in S is at position x = γ v t’, and t = γ t’.

Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves x = γ v t’ and this happens at time t = γ t’.

Therefore, γ ≈1.0206, calculated before. So, x = 1.0206 * 0.2c * 50 , which is as before.

So yes, solving this way, x = gamma*v*t', so the distance is ΓvT’, where Γ is gamma.

So, then, plugging in numbers: Gamma=1.0206, v=60,000 km/s, T’=50 s.

Thus, distance x = 1.0206 * 60,000 km/s * 50 s = roughly same as before, 1.0206*3,000,000 km = 3,061,800 km ≈ 3.06 x 10^6 km. Thus, the answer would be approximately 3.0618e6 kilometers.

But let me do more precise calculation with gamma.

First, exact gamma calculation.

v = 0.2c, so v²/c² = 0.04.

Therefore, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.04)) = 1/sqrt(0.96)

sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798 (since 0.9798² = approximately 0.96, since 0.98²=0.9604)

But let’s do accurate calculation:

sqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(0.9604 - 0.0004) since 0.98²=0.9604, so sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(0.980^2 - (0.0004)) ≈ but perhaps not necessary. Use Taylor series approximation at x=0.04:

sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1 - (0.04)/2 - (0.04)^2/8 - ... ≈ 1 - 0.02 - 0.0002 = 0.9798.

Alternatively, using a calculator-like approach:

√0.96.

Well, maybe we can compute it better.

Let sigma = 0.96. Let's square root. We can attempt linear approximation.

√(1 - δ) ≈ 1 - δ/2 - δ²/8 - δ³/16 - ...

for δ = 0.04, so √0.96 ≈ 1 - 0.02 - 0.0004/ ( 8 represents (δ^2)/8 )?

Wait, hold on—it’s sigma = 1 - δ, δ=0.04. So, √sigma ≈ 1 - δ/2 - (δ²)/8 - (δ^3)/16...

But delta here is 0.04.

So:

sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈1 - 0.04/2 - (0.04)^2 / 8 ≈1 -0.02 -0.00016/8≈1-0.02 -0.00002=0.97998.

Wait, perhaps use exact value sqrt(24/25)=sqrt(24)/5≈4.89898/5=0.979796.

So, maybe exactly 0.979796.

Thus, gamma is 1/0.979796≈1.020620726.

So, gamma=1.020620726.

Then, t = gamma *t'=1.020620726 *50≈51.0310363 seconds.

Then, x=vt=60, 000 km/s *51.0310363 s≈60,000 *51.0310363≈3,061,862.18 km≈3.06186218 × 10^6 km.

Thus, approximately 3.061862×10^6 km.

Let me confirm if due care occurred with units. Given:

v =0.2c, which indeed has to be 60,000 km/s as per the problem (with c=300,000 km/s), correct.

If the Galaxy perceives the ejecta approaching at 60,000 km/s, so according to Galaxy's frame, velocity is indeed 60,000 km/s. The event in the ejecta's frame is when its clock has counted 50 seconds, so we Lorentz transformed it to Galaxy's reference frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, that event (ejecta having its own clock at 50s) translates to the ejecta being located at x= gamma vt' (from the previous calculation) and the time at t= gamma t'.

But x (position of ejecta in Galaxy frame at t=gamma t') = gamma v t'

So yes, that distance is about 3.06 million km.

However, necessary to validate if this approach is correct. For example, can we not consider the situation in another way? From the ejecta's frame, they measure 50 seconds, and during that time, the Galactic center moved towards them at 0.2c, reaching a total distance covered. Then, that distance might be, in ejecta's frame, (60,000 km/s)*50 s=3,000,000 km.

However, in the Galaxy's frame, that same physical distance would be subject to length contraction? Wait, but the direction of motion is along the Galactic center moving towards the ejecta. Proper length and whatever. Wait, but if the ejecta measures a length contraction in the Galaxy's frame.

But for the distance between the ejecta and the Galactic center, perhaps use that length contraction happens in direction of motion. If in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, then at rest, the spatial separation might not be contracted, but since they are approaching each other.

Alternatively, perhaps not. Straightforward relativistic approach may be best. The first method focused on converting the even where the ejecta's own clock reads 50 seconds to Galactic frame using Lorentz transformation, where indeed x = gamma v t', gives x≈ approx. 3.06 million km. But why not answer is just v * t? For low speeds, the Galilean answer is that in the Galaxy's frame, even if the time is higher? But since velocity is 0.2c, so may not be negligible.

Alternatively, intuition fails here because time and space are references in each frame. Let’s consider if an observer on the ejecta argues that the Galactic center moves towards them at 0.2c, so in 50 seconds, 3 x 10^6 km. But in Galactic frame, it's the ejecta moving, so time for the same journey would prefer different times.

Wait, but in the Galactic frame, the time is gamma t', so the distance covered by the ejecta is gamma t' * v, which is gamma numerical factor (1.02). It's cumbersome, but it's due accounting for relativistic effects even if the speed is only 0.2c. The speed’s enough (sixty thousand km/s is two tenths of light speed) to require SR.

Is 1.02 gamma sufficiently close to 1 to approximate it (depending on answer requirements)? The problem gives precise numbers, so definitely needs to include gamma.

But here, 1.02 indicates a 2% difference from coordinate time vs. proper time. Therefore, when you factor this in, you multiply 50 sec by 1.02 to get 51 sec in the Galaxy’s frame, and therefore, 60,000 km/s * 51 sec: 3,060,000 km. So approximately 3.06 x10^6 km.

But in terms of precise answer—— wait, "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So relativistic distance.

Let me re-express the entire sequence with the exact steps.

The required formula was derived:

x = γ v t', with v = 0.2c, t' =50 s, and γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)=1.020620726.

Therefore, x =1.020620726*(0.2c)*50 s.

However, 0.2c=60,000 km/s, so no need to convert c to km/s as it's already known. So:

1.020620726 * 60,000 *50=1.020620726 *3,000,000 ≈3,061,862.18 km.

Thus, it's 3,061,862 km. The problem expects perhaps truncated to the nearest integer or precise value. So... If writing in calculator precise terms:

Multiplications:

1.020620726 * 60,000 = ?. Let me compute 60,000 multiplied in parts.

60,000 × 1.020620726 = 61,237.24356.

Thus, 60,000 × 1.02 = 61,200.

61,237.24356 per minute.

Multiply by 50 seconds: 61,237.24356 km/s *50 s=3,061,862.178 km.

Thus, approximates to 3,061,862 km.

However, problems generally wait in units. If expressing in km, it's of order million km.

Alternatively, compare the answer derived through Lorentz transforms.

Another thought flow: the proper time is 50 seconds for the ejecta, so using space time interval.

But we are asked in the Galaxy's frame: space time concept.

Alternatively, the invariant spacetime interval for the ejecta's journey...

Between two events: departure and arrival somewhere, but the proper time is measured by the ejecta's own clock, 50 seconds. The interval itself would be identical in every frame. However, coordinate distances would vary.

But s^2 = (c Δt')^2 = (c Δt)^2 - (Δx)^2.

But in the Galaxy's frame, time elapsed is Δt, space is Δx = v Δt. That with TSR interval:

(c Δt')^2 = (c Δt)^2 - (v Δt )^2.

Then, (c Δt') = sqrt( (c Δt)^2 - (v Δt )^2 )

Thus, solving for Δt,

(c Δt') = Δt sqrt( c² -v² )

Δt = c Δt' / sqrt( c² - v² )

But squareroot(c² -v² )=c sqrt(1 -v²/c² ) So  delta t= c t' / (c sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2 ))=t'/sqrt(1 -v^ 2/c² )=gamma t'. So same as before. So, this reproduction method gives the same expression for time in Galaxy's frame.

Then, delta X= v delta t= v gamma t'

Same answer again. So confirm that irrespective of approach, the answer is v gamma t'

Therefore likely correct.

So generally, the answer is ≈3,061,862 km, approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

Given that precise calculation yields 3,061,862 kilometers, perhaps expressed more concisely. Alternatively, if permitted, in exponents: 3.06 x10^6 km. Given the problem inputs were two signifiant figures for velocity (60,000 km/s  is one significant figure?), wait.

Wait, speed is given as 60,000 km/s. Possibly two? Eg, the number 60,000 is 6 followed by 4 zeros. But not using decimal, but trailing zeros. Ambiguity arises. If it's defined as two significant figures (60,000 with the comma as a thousand separator), accurate to one or five significant figures? But most likely two figures: 60. Thousand. However, the problem states "60 000 km/s," if written with space separator instead of comma, in more European convention, with decimal comma; but regardless, in science, trailing zeros in figure with a number like 60000 is ambiguous unless a decimal is included. However, the note that velocity is 60 000 km/s is two significant digits if written with one significant digit, but approximate. Hmm this could perhaps introduce dependence, but since answer expects LaTeX, will just go with precise calculation.

If the problem's answer is given as a particular detailed number, perhaps using approximate numbers in the calculation. But if the problem is presented such that the relative velocity is exactly 0.2c (since 60,000 km/s is exactly 0.2*c, with c at exactly 300,000 km/s), then the answer becomes pure algebra.

If v = 0.2c, then gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 /sqrt(24/25) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) ; correction.

Wait 1 - (0.2c)^2 / c² = 1 - 0.04=0.96=24/25.

Thus, sqrt(24/25)= (2*sqrt(6))/5.

Thus, gamma=5/( 2 sqrt(6) ). Exactly.

So gamma=5/(2√6). So t=gamma t'= (5/(2√6 )) *50=250/(2√6 )=125/(sqrt(6).

Distance x= v t=0.2c *125/sqrt(6).

Compute that:

C=300,000 km/s⇒0.2c=60,000 km/s.

Hence, x=60000 *125/sqrt(6)=60000 *125 /2.449489743≈

First, compute numerator:60000*125=7,500,000.

Divide by sqrt(6)=7,500,000 /2.449489743≈3,061,862.178..., again the same as previous. So exact same value. So the precise answer.

Therefore, in exact terms it's x=60,000 * (50 seconds) * (1/ sqrt(0.96)). The answer cancels with no approximations: Is there a possibility to show it in terms of exact units?

But answer would be 60,000 km/s *50 s * (5/(2*sqrt(6)) ) up to multiplicative factors.

But perhaps he question expects standard decimal form, so better to write approximately 3.06 x 10^6 km.

But check for error. For example, some do clicker.

Alternate approach. If today, encountering a question where an object moves at velocity v from the Galaxy's frame. When a time T' passes in its own your frame, how much would have traveled,

then x = v * T * gamma.Explanation：

When calculating the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame, we need to account for relativistic effects due to the high velocity of 60,000 km/s (0.2c). The time experienced by the ejecta (proper time) is 50 seconds. Using the time dilation effect from special relativity, the coordinate time in the Galaxy's frame is dilated by the Lorentz factor γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1.0206. Multiplying this factor by the velocity and the proper time gives the distance traveled:

```
x = γ * v * Δt'
```

Plugging in the values:

```
x = 1.0206 * 60,000 km/s * 50 s ≈ 3,061,862 km
```

Thus, the ejecta travels approximately **3.06 million kilometers** in the Galaxy's reference frame.

**Final Answer**
The ejecta travels approximately \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy's reference frame.
