To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx under the assumption that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, we start by understanding the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance \( d \) in parsecs, i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \).

1. **Volume Element in Spherical Coordinates**: For a uniform distribution of stars, the number of stars in a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \), leading to the number of stars per unit distance being proportional to \( d^2 \).

2. **Transforming Distance to Parallax**: Using the relation \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we convert the volume element from distance to parallax. The Jacobian of the transformation \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) gives \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \).

3. **Substituting into the Volume Element**: Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \) into the volume element:
   \[
   N(d) \, dd \propto 4\pi d^2 \, dd = 4\pi \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \right) d\text{plx} = \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}
   \]

4. **Number of Stars per Unit Parallax**: This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with the fourth power of the parallax. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax if stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Let me start from the basics.

First, parallax (plx) is related to the distance of a star. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So, the farther away a star is, the smaller its parallax. That makes sense since closer stars have larger parallax angles.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number of stars at a certain distance should depend on the volume of space at that distance. For a uniform distribution, the density of stars (number per unit volume) is constant. So, the number of stars within a shell at distance d with thickness dd would be the density multiplied by the volume of that shell, right?

The volume of a spherical shell is approximately 4πd² dd. So, if N is the number of stars, N(d) dd = ρ * 4πd² dd, where ρ is the stellar density. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance (dd) is proportional to d². That's the familiar volume effect—more stars at larger distances because the volume increases with the cube of the radius, but since we're looking at a shell's volume, it's the square here.

But the question is about number per unit range of parallax, not per unit distance. So we need to convert from distance to parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let’s denote ϖ as parallax to use symbols properly. So, ϖ = 1/d => d = 1/ϖ. 

We need to find dN/dϖ, the number of stars per unit parallax. Since we have N(d) dd proportional to d² dd, we can express this in terms of ϖ by substituting d = 1/ϖ.

First, express dd in terms of dϖ. Differentiate both sides of ϖ = 1/d:

dϖ/dd = -1/d² => dd = -(d²) dϖ

But since we are dealing with absolute values (parallax can't be negative), the negative sign just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases, so we can ignore the sign for the purpose of the density. So, substituting dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ, wait: Let me check that differentiation again.

If ϖ = 1/d, then d = 1/ϖ

Then taking derivatives:

dd/dϖ = -1/ϖ²

So, dd = (-1/ϖ²) dϖ

But since distance increases as parallax decreases, when we transform variables, the absolute value gives dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ in magnitude.

So now, the number of stars in a shell between ϖ and ϖ + dϖ is:

N(ϖ) dϖ = N(d) dd = ρ *4π d² dd = ρ *4π (1/ϖ²)² * (1/ϖ²) dϖ ?

Wait, slower:

N(d) dd = ρ *4π d² dd

Expressed in terms of ϖ, since d = 1/ϖ, then d² = 1/ϖ², and dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ.

Substituting into N(d) dd, we get:

N(ϖ) dϖ = ρ *4π*(1/ϖ²)*(1/ϖ²) dϖ = ρ*4π*(1/ϖ^4) dϖ

But this gives N(ϖ) = ρ*4π/ϖ^4

But that seems like the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/ϖ^4. Wait, that seems steep. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the chain rule. The relation between the number per unit parallax and number per unit distance.

The correct approach is to use the transformation of variables in probability or density functions. 

If we have a function N(d) = dN/dd = 4πρ d², then when changing variables from d to ϖ, we have:

N(ϖ) = N(d) * |dd/dϖ|

Since ϖ = 1/d, d = 1/ϖ, so dd/dϖ = -1/ϖ²

Therefore, |dd/dϖ| = 1/ϖ²

Hence,

N(ϖ) = 4πρ d² * (1/ϖ²) = 4πρ (1/ϖ²) * (1/ϖ²) = 4πρ / ϖ^4

Wait, this would mean the number of stars per unit parallax is N(ϖ) = 4πρ / ϖ^4, so proportional to 1/ϖ^4. Hmm. But this seems like for smaller ϖ (larger distances), the number per unit parallax is larger. But intuitively, since the volume increases with d², isn't the parallax related inversely, so higher parallax (nearby stars) should have lower numbers?

Wait, but perhaps not. Let's think about integrating over ϖ.

If N(ϖ) is number per unit ϖ, then integrating from ϖ1 to ϖ2 should give the total number of stars in that parallax range.

If you have N(ϖ) proportional to 1/ϖ^4, then integrating that from a lower ϖ to higher ϖ (nearer stars) would give a larger contribution? Wait, if it's 1/ϖ^4, the integral over a small interval of ϖ near zero would be big. Wait, but ϖ is the parallax, so larger ϖ is nearby. So if N(ϖ) is proportional to 1/ϖ^4, then the number of stars per unit ϖ increases as ϖ decreases. Which would mean that there are more stars at small parallaxes (distant stars)?

But wait, the volume at larger distances has more stars, but since parallax is 1/d, small parallax corresponds to large distance. So yes, more stars should be at small parallaxes, matching that N(ϖ) decreases as ϖ increases. Wait, but this is N(ϖ) ~ 1/ϖ^4, so as ϖ approaches zero, N(ϖ) tends to infinity. But physically, the number of stars is finite. Wait, this must mean our analysis is missing something, like a maximum distance or that the uniform distribution has a cutoff. But the assumption is that stars are uniformly distributed so infinitely in space? Then this will blow up as ϖ approaches zero (d approaches infinity). But practically, we don't have infinite stars, but I guess the problem assumes infinite space? Hmm.

But if there's no limit, the integral of N(ϖ) from 0 to ϖ_max (corresponding to d_min =1/ϖ_min >0) would be?

Wait, perhaps the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to ϖ^{-4}. Thus, it steeply increases as parallax decreases. But again, in reality, the density function cannot extend to ϖ=0, unless we consider infinite space, but here maybe the question is phrased without considering that. So the answer would be that the number density per unit parallax is proportional to 1/ϖ^4.  Without any upper or lower limits.

Wait, let me check with another approach.

Suppose there are N stars with parallax between ϖ and ϖ + dϖ. To number N is equal to the number of stars between distances d and d + dd, where d=1/ϖ and dd is the distance interval corresponding to dϖ. That is, Δd corresponds to Δϖ. So to find ΔN = ρ × 4πd² Δd. Then, Δd can be expressed in terms of Δϖ: since ϖ = 1/d, derivative dd/dϖ = -1/ϖ², so Δd ≈ |dd/dϖ| Δϖ = 1/ϖ² Δϖ. So, ΔN = ρ ×4 π d² (1/ϖ²) Δϖ. But since d = 1/ϖ, substitute d² = 1 / ϖ². Thus, ΔN = ρ ×4 π (1/ϖ²) (1/ϖ²) Δϖ = 4 π ρ / ϖ^4 Δϖ. Therefore, the number per unit parallax is dN/dϖ =4 π ρ / ϖ^4. So yes, seems correct.

Thus, unless there's a cut-off, it scales as ϖ^{-4}. So, answer would be that the number per unit parallax decreases as the inverse fourth power of parallax, i.e., proportional to 1/ϖ^4.

But hold on, usually when you consider distribution of stars with distance for constant density, it's like ρ(r) = constant, and then number N(r) dr =4 π r² ρ dr, which when converted to parallax, gives different. But why is this different? Let me check.

Parallax distribution: For nearby stars (large ϖ), there are fewer stars because volume nearby is small, but wait no, the volume nearby is actually bigger in shell? Wait, hold on.

Wait, actually, confusion between distance distribution. So, if we think of very small d, then the volume element is 4πd² dd. So, although in each distance shell further out, the volume of the shell increases with d², the number of stars increases but the conversion to parallax makes this effect even more.

If we have more stars at larger d (distance), but Parallax is inverse distance. So at small ϖ (large d, more spread out in distance and more volume), so when converted to ϖ, which is 1/d, the d =1/ϖ, that is, the density per unit ϖ is related to the derivative of the transformation. Therefore, changes in parallax range correspond to changes in distance, and with the number counts being dependent on volume.

Thus, maybe the conclusion of N(ϖ) ~ 1/ϖ^4 is correct.

But wait, perhaps another way. Let’s think about count per unit parallax as a density. Suppose you want to know how many stars are in a small parallax bin from ϖ to ϖ + δϖ. The corresponding distances are d = 1/ϖ to d' = 1/(ϖ + δϖ). The thickness in distance is δd =1/(ϖ + δϖ) −1/ϖ ≈ - (δϖ)/ϖ². Take absolute value. So, number in this delta_ϖ is approximately ρ*4πd² * |Δd| = ρ*4π (1/ϖ²) * (Δϖ / ϖ²) ) = 4πρ (Δϖ)/ϖ^4.

Thus, the number density (per unit ϖ) is N(ϖ) = dN/dϖ =4πρ / ϖ^4. So, indeed, without considering any selection effects or truncation, if the density is uniformly distributed, number per unit parallax goes as ϖ^{-4}.

But let me check references: I recall that in astronomy, the number of stars per unit parallax does go up steeply with decreasing parallax (increasing distance), but in reality, the distribution is complicated by the luminosity function and the scale height of the Galactic disk, but since the problem states uniform distribution, so I must ignore those complications.

Alternatively, another thought: Let's construct the cumulative number N(<ϖ), the number of stars with parallax less than ϖ (i.e., farther than 1/ϖ). Then,

N(<ϖ) = ∫ from 0 to ϖ N(ϖ') dϖ'

But in reality, the cumulative stars for distance greater than d =1/ϖ is:

N(>d) = integral from d to infinity ρ 4 π r² dr = 4 π ρ integral_d^infty r² dr = ... Wait, this integral diverges, which says that if stars are uniformly distributed to infinity, then the total number is infinite. So N(>d) is 4πρ ∫_d^infty r² dr = infinity, which is consistent with divergent.

But in the parallax, if you make the transformation, you have:

N(>0) = integral of N(ϖ) dϖ from 0 to infinity.

But N(ϖ) ~ ϖ^{-4}. Then ∫ (from ϖ =0 to ϖ=infty) ϖ^{-4} dϖ. Wait ϖ from 0 to infty would be d from infty to 0. Wait, no. Wait, since ϖ ∝ 1/d.

When ϖ approaches 0, d approaches infty.

ϖ approaches infty, d approaches 0.

But integrating from ϖ=0 to infty would correspond to holding d from infty to 0. But the number of stars. So:

∫_{ϖ=0}^\infty N(ϖ) dϖ = ∫_{d=0}^\infty N(d) dd = infty, which is a problem. Also, considering |Jacobian|,

∫ N(ϖ) dϖ = ∫ N(d) |dd/dϖ| dϖ = ∫ [4πρ d²] [1 / ϖ²] dϖ.

But since d =1/ϖ, then N(ϖ) dϖ = 4πρ (1/ϖ^4) dϖ. Integrating from ϖ=0 to ϖ=∞:

4πρ ∫_{0}^\infty (1/ϖ^4) dϖ = 4πρ [ ( -1/(3ϖ^3) ) ]_0^\infty

But this is problematic because at ϖ=0, it diverges (to -infinity / 0), and at ϖ=infty, tends to 0. Well, the integral isn't converging. Which is again the same conclusion: if the distribution extends to infinity, the total number is infinite, so in our local analysis near a finite parallax, assuming uniform density, you get N(ϖ)~1/ϖ^4.

But the original assumption is "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky". Wait, does that mean projected on the sky? Because if stars are uniformly distributed in space, which we've been assuming. But maybe the wording is ambiguous.

Alternatively, if stars are uniformly distributed in the sky (i.e., projected density is uniform), but how does that affect the 3D distribution? That’s a different problem.

Wait, the user said "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky", which might actually refer to a uniform distribution on the celestial sphere. But in reality, that's different from uniform distribution in space (3D uniform). Maybe that was a mistranslation or misphrase. If the stars are uniformly distributed on the sky (i.e., their positions are random on the sphere), but in space they can still have a density distribution.

But if stars are locally isotropic and uniform in their spatial distribution, then the problem would lead to the 1/ϖ^4. However, if their directions are uniformly distributed but their distances are fixed, which is different. But the term "uniformly distributed in the sky" is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original question again: "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky". Hmm. "Distributed in the sky" could mean their angular positions are random, but doesn't necessarily describe their radial distribution.

But common usage in astronomy for "uniformly distributed" in space usually means homogeneous and isotropic. So perhaps that's the case here. But the user would need to clarify, but since they mention "in the sky", which might imply angular distribution. But as a non-native speaker or perhaps mistranslation. It seems reasonable to proceed under translation as uniform spatial distribution.

However, another possibility: All stars have the same distance but are uniformly distributed across the celestial sphere. In that case, the number per parallax would just be a delta function at ϖ=1/d. But I don't think that's the scenario here.

Alternatively, if stars have a distribution in distance but uniform across the sky, perpendicular to the line of sight, meaning projected distribution. Which is a combination. But if they have isotropic, uniform in space, that would mean as previously: volume density leads to number per unit parallax increasing as a high power, 1/ϖ^4.

Hence, sticking with that, I think the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/ϖ^4.

So when someone asks how the number of stars per unit parallax changes with parallax, answer according to inverse fourth power. So if we double the parallax, the number per unit range becomes 1/16th. For larger parallax (nearby stars), the number per unit parallax is smaller, and for smaller parallax (distant stars), the number per unit parallax increases.

Thus, in general, if the density is constant, N(ϖ) dϖ ∝ ϖ^{-4} dϖ.

But just to confirm through another angle. Let's consider an example. Suppose you look at parallax between ϖ and 2ϖ. For small ϖ (large distance). But according to this, number of stars in [ϖ,2ϖ] would be proportional to ∫ from ϖ to 2ϖ (1/x⁴) dx = [ -1/(3x³) ]_{ϖ}^{2ϖ} = (-1/(3*(2ϖ)^3) + 1/(3*ϖ³)) = 1/(3ϖ³)*(1 - 1/8) = (7)/(24ϖ³). So compared to a different range, like [ϖ/2, ϖ], for large ϖ (corresponds to nearer stars)? Wait, that would be x from ϖ/2 to ϖ ∫ ϖ^{-4} dx. Wait, same math. Wait, but integrating over different ranges of ϖ.

Wait, here the key is that for N(ϖ) gives ϖ^{-4}, the number is very sharply declining with ϖ, so stars with higher parallax (nearby) have their contribution per unit parallax dropping extremely rapidly. Thus, if you think again, the number per unit parallax peaks at the smallest parallaxes (largest distances) but in reality, that's assuming an infinite distribution. So the conclusion is inverse fourth power.

Another way: imagine choosing a random star, its probability density in parallax is proportional to 1/ϖ^4 (unnormalized). This leads to very high probability at low parallax. But without upper or lower limits, it diverges.

But if question is within the framework of real stars where maximum distance is limited (which it isn't in problem statement here), then the result would differ. But since the question states "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky", assuming uniform density in space. Hence, the answer is at each parallax plx, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to plx^{-4}. Hence, inversely proportional to the fourth power.

So summarizing my reasoning: The number increases as parallax decreases, and the dependence is inversely proportional to the fourth power. The key steps are the relation between distance and parallax, volume element in spherical coordinates, and transformation of variables between distance and parallax. Thus, remembering that shell volume is proportional to d² dd, and translating dd terms into dϖ using the Jacobian gives us the 1/ϖ^4 factor. Even though integrating over all parallax leads to an infinite number (assuming no boundaries), for the purpose of per unit range, the dependence is as 1/plx^4. So the answer, per instructions, is that the number decreases with parallax following a fourth-power law, i.e., N(plx) ∝ plx^{-4}.


**Final Answer**
The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax. Thus, it changes as \boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}.

Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax if stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Let me start from the basics.

First, parallax (plx) is related to the distance of a star. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So, the farther away a star is, the smaller its parallax. That makes sense since closer stars have larger parallax angles.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number of stars at a certain distance should depend on the volume of space at that distance. For a uniform distribution, the density of stars (number per unit volume) is constant. So, the number of stars within a shell at distance d with thickness dd would be the density multiplied by the volume of that shell, right?

The volume of a spherical shell is approximately 4πd² dd. So, if N is the number of stars, N(d) dd = ρ * 4πd² dd, where ρ is the stellar density. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance (dd) is proportional to d². That's the familiar volume effect—more stars at larger distances because the volume increases with the cube of the radius, but since we're looking at a shell's volume, it's the square here.

But the question is about number per unit range of parallax, not per unit distance. So we need to convert from distance to parallax. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let’s denote ϖ as parallax to use symbols properly. So, ϖ = 1/d => d = 1/ϖ. 

We need to find dN/dϖ, the number of stars per unit parallax. Since we have N(d) dd proportional to d² dd, we can express this in terms of ϖ by substituting d = 1/ϖ.

First, express dd in terms of dϖ. Differentiate both sides of ϖ = 1/d:

dϖ/dd = -1/d² => dd = -(d²) dϖ

But since we are dealing with absolute values (parallax can't be negative), the negative sign just indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases, so we can ignore the sign for the purpose of the density. So, substituting dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ, wait: Let me check that differentiation again.

If ϖ = 1/d, then d = 1/ϖ

Then taking derivatives:

dd/dϖ = -1/ϖ²

So, dd = (-1/ϖ²) dϖ

But since distance increases as parallax decreases, when we transform variables, the absolute value gives dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ in magnitude.

So now, the number of stars in a shell between ϖ and ϖ + dϖ is:

N(ϖ) dϖ = N(d) dd = ρ *4π d² dd = ρ *4π (1/ϖ²)² * (1/ϖ²) dϖ ?

Wait, slower:

N(d) dd = ρ *4π d² dd

Expressed in terms of ϖ, since d = 1/ϖ, then d² = 1/ϖ², and dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ.

Substituting into N(d) dd, we get:

N(ϖ) dϖ = ρ *4π*(1/ϖ²)*(1/ϖ²) dϖ = ρ*4π*(1/ϖ^4) dϖ

But this gives N(ϖ) = ρ*4π/ϖ^4

But that seems like the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/ϖ^4. Wait, that seems steep. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the chain rule. The relation between the number per unit parallax and number per unit distance.

The correct approach is to use the transformation of variables in probability or density functions. 

If we have a function N(d) = dN/dd = 4πρ d², then when changing variables from d to ϖ, we have:

N(ϖ) = N(d) * |dd/dϖ|

Since ϖ = 1/d, d = 1/ϖ, so dd/dϖ = -1/ϖ²

Therefore, |dd/dϖ| = 1/ϖ²

Hence,

N(ϖ) = 4πρ d² * (1/ϖ²) = 4πρ (1/ϖ²) * (1/ϖ²) = 4πρ / ϖ^4

Wait, this would mean the number of stars per unit parallax is N(ϖ) = 4πρ / ϖ^4, so proportional to 1/ϖ^4. Hmm. But this seems like for smaller ϖ (larger distances), the number per unit parallax is larger. But intuitively, since the volume increases with d², isn't the parallax related inversely, so higher parallax (nearby stars) should have lower numbers?

If you have N(ϖ) proportional to 1/ϖ^4, then integrating that from a lower ϖ to higher ϖ (nearer stars) would give a larger contribution? W

I need to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies with parallax, assuming uniform stellar distribution in the sky.

Starting with fundamentals, parallax (plx) relates inversely to distance: plx = 1/d, where d represents distance in parsecs. This makes sense as stars closer to us display larger parallax angles.

For uniformly distributed stars, the number at a specific distance depends on the spatial volume at that distance. With constant stellar density, the number of stars within a shell at distance d with thickness dd equals the density multiplied by the shell's volume.

A spherical shell's volume approximates to 4πd² dd. If N represents star count, then N(d) dd = ρ * 4πd² dd, where ρ is stellar density. Thus, stars per unit distance is proportional to d². This reflects the volume effect—more stars exist at greater distances as volume increases with radius cubed, but for a shell's volume, it's squared.

However, I need to determine stars per unit range of parallax, not distance. Converting from distance to parallax: if ϖ (parallax) = 1/d, then d = 1/ϖ.

I need to find dN/dϖ, the stars per unit parallax. Since N(d) dd is proportional to d² dd, I must express this using ϖ by substituting d = 1/ϖ.

First, I'll express dd in terms of dϖ by differentiating ϖ = 1/d:
dϖ/dd = -1/d² → dd = -(d²) dϖ

Since parallax can't be negative, the negative sign merely indicates that as distance increases, parallax decreases. For density purposes, I can ignore this sign.

Substituting dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ—wait, let me verify this differentiation.

If ϖ = 1/d, then d = 1/ϖ
Taking derivatives: dd/dϖ = -1/ϖ²
So, dd = (-1/ϖ²) dϖ

Since distance increases as parallax decreases, when transforming variables, the absolute value gives dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ in magnitude.

The number of stars in a shell between ϖ and ϖ + dϖ is:
N(ϖ) dϖ = N(d) dd = ρ *4π d² dd

Expressed using ϖ, since d = 1/ϖ, then d² = 1/ϖ², and dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ.

Substituting into N(d) dd:
N(ϖ) dϖ = ρ *4π*(1/ϖ²)*(1/ϖ²) dϖ = ρ*4π*(1/ϖ⁴) dϖ

This gives N(ϖ) = ρ*4π/ϖ⁴

So stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/ϖ⁴. This seems steep; let me verify.

The correct approach uses variable transformation in probability functions.

If N(d) = dN/dd = 4πρ d², then when changing variables from d to ϖ:
N(ϖ) = N(d) * |dd/dϖ|

Since dd/dϖ = -1/ϖ², |dd/dϖ| = 1/ϖ²

Therefore:
N(ϖ) = 4πρ d² * (1/ϖ²) = 4πρ (1/ϖ²)² = 4πρ / ϖ⁴

This confirms that stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/ϖ⁴. For smaller ϖ (greater distances), the number per unit parallax is larger. At first this seems counterintuitive—shouldn't nearby stars (higher parallax) have fewer numbers since volume increases with d²?

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to understand how the quantity of stars per unit range of parallax varies with parallax, assuming stars are uniformly spread across the sky. Let’s begin with the basics.

Initially, parallax (denoted plx) is linked to a star’s distance with the formula plx = 1/d, where d signifies distance in parsecs. Hence, the greater the distance of a star, the smaller its parallax, which makes sense because stars that are closer have larger parallax angles.

When stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars at a certain distance depends on the volume of space at that distance. With a uniform distribution, the density of stars (number per unit volume) remains constant. Therefore, the number of stars within a shell at distance d with thickness dd equates to the density multiplied by the shell's volume.

The volume of a spherical shell is roughly 4πd² dd. Thus, if N represents the number of stars, N(d) dd = ρ * 4πd² dd, where ρ is the stellar density. Consequently, the number of stars per unit distance (dd) is proportional to d². This is the well-known volume effect—more stars are present at greater distances because the volume expands with the cube of the radius, but since we’re examining a shell’s volume, it’s the square here.

However, the real inquiry is about the number per unit range of parallax, rather than per unit distance. Therefore, conversion from distance to parallax is necessary. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let’s use ϖ to denote parallax precisely. So, ϖ = 1/d => d = 1/ϖ.

We seek to find dN/dϖ, the number of stars per unit parallax. Since N(d) dd is proportional to d² dd, this can be rewritten in terms of ϖ by substituting d = 1/ϖ.

First, express dd in terms of dϖ by differentiating both sides of ϖ = 1/d:

dϖ/dd = -1/d² => dd = -(d²) dϖ

Since absolute values are used (parallax cannot be negative), the negative sign merely highlights that distance increases as parallax decreases, so the sign can be disregarded for density purposes. Thus, by substituting dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ, let’s reassess the differentiation.

If ϖ = 1/d, then d = 1/ϖ

After differentiation:

dd/dϖ = -1/ϖ²

Therefore, dd = (-1/ϖ²) dϖ

Acknowledging that with increasing distance, decreasing parallax implies a transformation of variables, the absolute value indicates dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ in magnitude.

Thus, the number of stars in a shell between ϖ and ϖ + dϖ is:

N(ϖ) dϖ = N(d) dd = ρ * 4π d² dd = ρ * 4π (1/ϖ²)² * (1/ϖ²) dϖ

Examining more closely:

N(d) dd = ρ * 4π d² dd

In terms of ϖ, since d = 1/ϖ, then d² = 1/ϖ², and dd = (1/ϖ²) dϖ.

Substituting into N(d) dd, we derive:

N(ϖ) dϖ = ρ * 4π * (1/ϖ²) * (1/ϖ²) dϖ = ρ * 4π / ϖ^4 dϖ

This implies that N(ϖ) = ρ * 4π / ϖ^4

This seems to indicate that the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/ϖ^4. On reconsideration, this means for smaller ϖ (larger distances), the number per unit parallax is larger. However, it seems counterintuitive as one might think the volume increases with d², suggesting parallax relates inversely, so higher parallax (nearby stars) should result in lower numbers?

Nevertheless, perhaps not. Let’s consider integrating over ϖ.

If N(ϖ) denotes the number per unit ϖ, integrating from ϖ1 to ϖ2 would reveal the total number of stars in that parallax range.

So, if N(ϖ) is proportional to 1/ϖ^4, then integrating from a lower ϖ to a higher ϖ (nearer stars) indeed gives a larger contribution.

Suppose we have a uniform density of stars. For a given parallax ϖ, how many stars have parallax between ϖ and ϖ + Δϖ?\n\nFirst, convert ϖ to d: d = 1/ϖ. The parallax ϖ + Δϖ corresponds to distance d’ = 1/(ϖ + Δϖ). The distance range from d’ to d, so Δd = d’ - d = 1/(ϖ + Δϖ) - 1/ϖ ≈ - (Δϖ)/ϖ² for small Δϖ.\n\nThus, the volume between d and d’ is 4πd² Δd. But here, Δd is negative, but the actual thickness is |Δd| ≈ Δϖ / ϖ². Therefore, volume ≈ 4πd² * (Δϖ / ϖ²). Since d = 1/ϖ, d² = 1/ϖ². Substitute into volume:\n\n4π * (1/ϖ²) * (Δϖ / ϖ²) ) = 4π Δϖ / ϖ⁴. \n\nSince the number of stars is density multiplied by volume, N = ρ * volume = 4πρ Δϖ / ϖ⁴.\n\nTherefore, the number per unit parallax is N/Δϖ = 4πρ / ϖ⁴. So indeed, N(ϖ) is proportional to 1/ϖ⁴. That seems correct mathematically.\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive. Because if I look at nearby stars (large ϖ), there should be fewer stars than at larger distances. But since the volume increases as d², but when mapped to ϖ, the scaling becomes 1/ϖ⁴. Wait, but number of stars within a parallax range Δϖ converts to being proportional to ϖ^(-4). So as ϖ increases (closer stars), the number per unit parallax decreases.\n\nBut this seems to make sense. For example, consider two parallax bins: one at 1 mas (milliarcsecond) and one at 2 mas.\n\nAt 1 mas (distance 1000 pc), the number per unit ϖ is 4πρ / (1)^4.\n\nAt 2 mas (distance 500 pc), number per unit ϖ is 4πρ / (2)^4 = 4πρ /16. So per unit parallax, fewer stars at higher parallaxes (closer distances). However, the actual number of stars in a parallax bin Δϖ would be N(ϖ) Δϖ. Since stars with higher ϖ (closer) have lower N(ϖ), so a parallax bin Δϖ=1 mas would pick up more stars at lower ϖ (more distant stars), because N(ϖ) is higher there. Wait, but no—if N(ϖ) is the number per unit parallax, then integrating over a parallax interval adds up N(ϖ) Δϖ. Wait, but for nearby stars (ϖ large), N(ϖ) is small but if the parallax range is the same, how does it compare?\n\nWait, but this comes back to our transformed variable.\n\nAnother way: think of the number of stars between ϖ and ϖ + dϖ is proportional to 1/ϖ^4 dϖ. Thus, the density decreases rapidly with increasing ϖ. So, numbers of stars per unit parallax drops off as parallax increases. So in the solar neighborhood (large ϖ), there are fewer stars per unit parallax, but each parallax bin corresponds to a smaller volume. Conversely, at small ϖ (large distances), each parallax bin corresponds to a larger volume (since a small change in ϖ corresponds to a large change in distance), leading to more stars.\n\nSo the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with parallax as 1/ϖ^4. So the number per unit range of parallax is proportional to ϖ^(-4), so a steeply decreasing function with increasing ϖ.\n\nWait, but let's confirm this result with another perspective. Suppose we express the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than ϖ (i.e., distance less than 1/ϖ). \n\nCumulative number N(>ϖ) = integral from ϖ to infinity of N(ϖ') dϖ' = integral from ϖ to infinity of (4πρ / ϖ'^4) dϖ' = 4πρ integral_ϖ^infty ϖ'^(-4) dϖ' = 4πρ [ - (1/(3 ϖ'^3)) ]_ϖ^infty = 4πρ (1/(3 ϖ^3)) \n\nThus, N(>ϖ) = (4πρ /3 ) / ϖ^3. Which makes sense because the number of stars within distance d =1/ϖ is the volume (4π/3 d^3) times density ρ. So (4π/3) (1/ϖ)^3 ρ, which matches the cumulative N(>ϖ).\n\nThus, differentiation N(>ϖ) with respect to ϖ gives differential number:\n\ndN/dϖ = -4πρ / ϖ^4. Which (apart from the sign) is the same as earlier, confirming the result. Thus, indeed, N(ϖ) is proportional to ϖ^{-4}.\n\nBut wait: there's a negative sign here, but since number of stars N(>ϖ) decreases as ϖ increases (since you are considering stars further away), so the differential dN/dϖ is negative, but since we take the absolute value for the density, the number per unit parallax is 4πρ / ϖ^4.\n\nSo yes, that seems correct.\n\nHowever, some references say that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to ϖ^{-4}, others say different. Let me think if there's any standard result. From what I recall in astronomy, when transforming from distance to parallax, since the parallax is 1/d, the density transforms as f(ϖ) = f(d) |dd/dϖ|, so f(ϖ) = (4πρ d²) * (1/ϖ²) ), which is 4πρ / ϖ^4.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the density in parallax space. Yeah, that's consistent with what we derived. So, the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit parallax falls off as the inverse fourth power of the parallax. So, it's a steeply decreasing function—so as parallax increases (stars get closer), there are fewer stars per unit parallax.\n\nBut this does seem a bit counterintuitive. Let me check with numbers. Suppose we have two parallax bins: 0.1 mas and 10 mas.\n\nAt ϖ =0.1 mas, d =10 pc (since 1/0.1=10), the number per unit parallax would be proportional to (0.1)^{-4} =10^4.\n\nAt ϖ=10 mas, d=0.1 pc, number per unit parallax is proportional to 10^{-4}. So, 10^4 times fewer stars per unit parallax at 10 mas vs 0.1 mas. That seems like for the same parallax bin width, you have more stars in the 0.1 mas bin? But 0.1 mas is larger distance, but per unit parallax.\n\nBut if the bin is, say, 1 mas in parallax, around ϖ=10 mas, that corresponds to a distance range of d=1/10 to 1/11 parsec ≈0.1 to ≈0.0909 parsec, so Δd≈0.0091 pc.\n\nVolume is ~4πd²Δd =4π*(0.1)^2 *0.0091≈4π*0.000091≈0.00114 pc³.\n\nAt ϖ=0.1 mas, bin width 1 mas would correspond to stepping from 0.1 mas to 1.1 mas (wait, ϖ=0.1 is at 10 pc. Wait, ϖ is the center, but a bin width in parallax is the same as deltaϖ regardless of where you are. Wait but if you want a fixed parallax bin, say deltaϖ=0.1 mas, then for parallaxes say around 0.1 mas, the deltaϖ=0.1 m as would correspond to delta d= (1/(ϖ+deltaϖ)) -1/ϖ ≈ -deltaϖ/(ϖ²) so with ϖ=0.1, deltaϖ=0.1, delta d= -0.1/(0.01) = -10 pc, but absolute delta d≈10 pc.\n\nSo actually volume would be 4πd² Δd=4π*(10 pc)^2*10 pc=4π*1000 pc³. Which is a large volume, hence more stars. But if we take high parallax bin around ϖ=1 mas (d=1 pc), deltaϖ=0.1 mas, delta d≈-0.1/(1)^2= -0.1 pc, Volume≈4π*1²*0.1≈0.4π pc³, which is much smaller. Thus, more stars in the lower parallax bin (i.e., bins at small ϖ correspond to more volume and hence more stars). But according to the formula, the number per unit parallax is N(ϖ)=4πρ/ϖ^4. So even with ϖ=0.1, deltaϖ=0.1, we get N=4πρ / (0.1)^4 *0.1=4πρ / 0.001=4000πρ. For the second case,  at ϖ=1, deltaϖ=0.1 is N=4πρ /1^4 *0.1=0.4πρ.\n\nSo indeed, orders of magnitude more stars in the lower ϖ (far away) large parallax bin.\n\nTherefore, the answer is correct: the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/ϖ^4. Hence, it increases as ϖ decreases, but specifically the dependence is inversely quartic.\n\nTherefore, the number per unit parallax N(ϖ) is proportional to ϖ^{-4}.\n\nBut let me just think once again. Suppose, for instance, if a star is at d=1pc, so ϖ=1 arcsec. If another is at d=2pc, ϖ=0.5. Consider shells around d and d'. For d=1pc, the shell between 1 and 1.1 pc: volume 4π(1.1^3 -1^3)/3 ≈4π(1.331-1)/3≈4π(0.331)/3≈0.44 cubic parsec. For d=2pc, shell between 2 and 2.1pc: volume≈4π(2.1^3 -2^3)/3≈4π(9.261 -8)/3≈4π*1.261/3≈5.28 cubic parsec. So five times larger volume, but ϖ for d=2 is 0.5, and since ϖ decreases as 1/d, the exact relation might need to be integrated. But translating into parallax per unit volume.\n\nBut with the argument being that because the conversion from d to ϖ is non-linear, a given interval in ϖ corresponds to a larger interval in d when d is large (small ϖ). So even though the volume per unit d is higher for larger d, the telescoping of ϖ into smaller and smaller bins as d increases could maybe cause other effects.\n\nBut our derivation from calculus suggests that the number per unit ϖ is 4πρ / ϖ^4. So maybe that's indeed correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the inverse fourth power of the parallax, i.e., N ∝ ϖ^{-4}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, we need to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (ϖ) changes with ϖ.

1. **Parallax-Distance Relationship**: Parallax ϖ is inversely proportional to distance d, i.e., ϖ = 1/d (where d is in parsecs).

2. **Volume Element in Spherical Coordinates**: The number of stars in a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πd² dd.

3. **Transforming Distance to Parallax**: 
   - Using the relationship d = 1/ϖ, we convert the volume element to parallax space.
   - Differentiating d with respect to ϖ gives dd/dϖ = -1/ϖ². Taking the absolute value, we get |dd| = (1/ϖ²) dϖ.

4. **Number of Stars in Parallax Space**:
   - Substituting d = 1/ϖ into the volume element, the volume becomes 4π(1/ϖ²)² (1/ϖ²) dϖ = 4π/ϖ⁴ dϖ.
   - The number of stars per unit parallax is then proportional to this volume, resulting in N(ϖ) ∝ ϖ⁻⁴.

5. **Verification**:
   - Cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than ϖ confirms the differential result, showing that N(>ϖ) ∝ 1/ϖ³, and differentiating gives N(ϖ) ∝ ϖ⁻⁴.

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax.

\boxed{N(\varpi) \propto \varpi^{-4}}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

8, if ϖ increases from 0 to some maximum, then when ϖ is small (distant stars), the density per parallax is high, but since the interval is small (if integrating in parallax), but in reality, dϖ corresponds to larger dd when ϖ is small.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because in terms of distance, the number increases with d², but when transformed to parallax, it depends on the derivative of the transformation.

Let’s consider a specific example. Suppose we have a uniform density of stars. For a given parallax ϖ, how many stars have parallax between ϖ and ϖ + Δϖ?

First, convert ϖ to d: d = 1/ϖ. The parallax ϖ + Δϖ corresponds to distance d’ = 1/(ϖ + Δϖ). The distance range from d’ to d, so Δd = d’ - d = 1/(ϖ + Δϖ) - 1/ϖ ≈ - (Δϖ)/ϖ² for small Δϖ.

Thus, the volume between d and d’ is 4πd² Δd. But here, Δd is negative, but the actual thickness is |Δd| ≈ Δϖ / ϖ². Therefore, volume ≈ 4πd² * (Δϖ / ϖ²). Since d = 1/ϖ, d² = 1/ϖ². Substitute into volume:

4π * (1/ϖ²) * (Δϖ / ϖ²) ) = 4π Δϖ / ϖ⁴. 

Since the number of stars is density multiplied by volume, N = ρ * volume = 4πρ Δϖ / ϖ⁴.

Therefore, the number per unit parallax is N/Δϖ = 4πρ / ϖ⁴. So indeed, N(ϖ) is proportional to 1/ϖ⁴. That seems correct mathematically.

But this seems counterintuitive. Because if I look at nearby stars (large ϖ), there should be fewer stars than at larger distances. But since the volume increases as d², but when mapped to ϖ, the scaling becomes 1/ϖ⁴. Wait, but number of stars within a parallax range Δϖ converts to being proportional to ϖ^(-4). So as ϖ increases (closer stars), the number per unit parallax decreases.

But this seems to make sense. For example, consider two parallax bins: one at 1 mas (milliarcsecond) and one at 2 mas.

At 1 mas (distance 1000 pc), the number per unit ϖ is 4πρ / (1)^4.

At 2 mas (distance 500 pc), number per unit ϖ is 4πρ / (2)^4 = 4πρ /16. So per unit parallax, fewer stars at higher parallaxes (closer distances). However, the actual number of stars in a parallax bin Δϖ would be N(ϖ) Δϖ. Since stars with higher ϖ (closer) have lower N(ϖ), so a parallax bin Δϖ=1 mas would pick up more stars at lower ϖ (more distant stars), because N(ϖ) is higher there. Wait, but no—if N(ϖ) is the number per unit parallax, then integrating over a parallax interval adds up N(ϖ) Δϖ. Wait, but for nearby stars (ϖ large), N(ϖ) is small but if the parallax range is the same, how does it compare?

Wait, but this comes back to our transformed variable.

Another way: think of the number of stars between ϖ and ϖ + dϖ is proportional to 1/ϖ^4 dϖ. Thus, the density decreases rapidly with increasing ϖ. So, numbers of stars per unit parallax drops off as parallax increases. So in the solar neighborhood (large ϖ), there are fewer stars per unit parallax, but each parallax bin corresponds to a smaller volume. Conversely, at small ϖ (large distances), each parallax bin corresponds to a larger volume (since a small change in ϖ corresponds to a large change in distance), leading to more stars.

So the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with parallax as 1/ϖ^4. So the number per unit range of parallax is proportional to ϖ^(-4), so a steeply decreasing function with increasing ϖ.

Wait, but let's confirm this result with another perspective. Suppose we express the cumulative number of stars with parallax greater than ϖ (i.e., distance less than 1/ϖ). 

Cumulative number N(>ϖ) = integral from ϖ to infinity of N(ϖ') dϖ' = integral from ϖ to infinity of (4πρ / ϖ'^4) dϖ' = 4πρ integral_ϖ^infty ϖ'^(-4) dϖ' = 4πρ [ - (1/(3 ϖ'^3)) ]_ϖ^infty = 4πρ (1/(3 ϖ^3)) 

Thus, N(>ϖ) = (4πρ /3 ) / ϖ^3. Which makes sense because the number of stars within distance d =1/ϖ is the volume (4π/3 d^3) times density ρ. So (4π/3) (1/ϖ)^3 ρ, which matches the cumulative N(>ϖ).

Thus, differentiation N(>ϖ) with respect to ϖ gives differential number:

dN/dϖ = -4πρ / ϖ^4. Which (apart from the sign) is the same as earlier, confirming the result. Thus, indeed, N(ϖ) is proportional to ϖ^{-4}.

But wait: there's a negative sign here, but since number of stars N(>ϖ) decreases as ϖ increases (since you are considering stars further away), so the differential dN/dϖ is negative, but since we take the absolute value for the density, the number per unit parallax is 4πρ / ϖ^4.

So yes, that seems correct.

However, some references say that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to ϖ^{-4}, others say different. Let me think if there's any standard result. From what I recall in astronomy, when transforming from distance to parallax, since the parallax is 1/d, the density transforms as f(ϖ) = f(d) |dd/dϖ|, so f(ϖ) = (4πρ d²) * (1/ϖ²) ), which is 4πρ / ϖ^4.

Alternatively, looking at the density in parallax space. Yeah, that's consistent with what we derived. So, the conclusion is that the number of stars per unit parallax falls off as the inverse fourth power of the parallax. So, it's a steeply decreasing function—so as parallax increases (stars get closer), there are fewer stars per unit parallax.

But this does seem a bit counterintuitive. Let me check with numbers. Suppose we have two parallax bins: 0.1 mas and 10 mas.

At ϖ =0.1 mas, d =10 pc (since 1/0.1=10), the number per unit parallax would be proportional to (0.1)^{-4} =10^4.

At ϖ=10 mas, d=0.1 pc, number per unit parallax is proportional to 10^{-4}. So, 10^4 times fewer stars per unit parallax at 10 mas vs 0.1 mas. That seems like for the same parallax bin width, you have more stars in the 0.1 mas bin? But 0.1 mas is larger distance, but per unit parallax.

But if the bin is, say, 1 mas in parallax, around ϖ=10 mas, that corresponds to a distance range of d=1/10 to 1/11 parsec ≈0.1 to ≈0.0909 parsec, so Δd≈0.0091 pc.

Volume is ~4πd²Δd =4π*(0.1)^2 *0.0091≈4π*0.000091≈0.00114 pc³.

At ϖ=0.1 mas, bin width 1 mas would correspond to stepping from 0.1 mas to 1.1 mas (wait, ϖ=0.1 is at 10 pc. Wait, ϖ is the center, but a bin width in parallax is the same as deltaϖ regardless of where you are. Wait but if you want a fixed parallax bin, say deltaϖ=0.1 mas, then for parallaxes say around 0.1 mas, the deltaϖ=0.1 m as would correspond to delta d= (1/(ϖ+deltaϖ)) -1/ϖ ≈ -deltaϖ/(ϖ²) so with ϖ=0.1, deltaϖ=0.1, delta d= -0.1/(0.01) = -10 pc, but absolute delta d≈10 pc.

So actually volume would be 4πd² Δd=4π*(10 pc)^2*10 pc=4π*1000 pc³. Which is a large volume, hence more stars. But if we take high parallax bin around ϖ=1 mas (d=1 pc), deltaϖ=0.1 mas, delta d≈-0.1/(1)^2= -0.1 pc, Volume≈4π*1²*0.1≈0.4π pc³, which is much smaller. Thus, more stars in the lower parallax bin (i.e., bins at small ϖ correspond to more volume and hence more stars). But according to the formula, the number per unit parallax is N(ϖ)=4πρ/ϖ^4. So even with ϖ=0.1, deltaϖ=0.1, we get N=4πρ / (0.1)^4 *0.1=4πρ / 0.001=4000πρ. For the second case,  at ϖ=1, deltaϖ=0.1 is N=4πρ /1^4 *0.1=0.4πρ.

So indeed, orders of magnitude more stars in the lower ϖ (far away) large parallax bin.

Therefore, the answer is correct: the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to 1/ϖ^4. Hence, it increases as ϖ decreases, but specifically the dependence is inversely quartic.

Therefore, the number per unit parallax N(ϖ) is proportional to ϖ^{-4}.

But let me just think once again. Suppose, for instance, if a star is at d=1pc, so ϖ=1 arcsec. If another is at d=2pc, ϖ=0.5. Consider shells around d and d'. For d=1pc, the shell between 1 and 1.1 pc: volume 4π(1.1^3 -1^3)/3 ≈4π(1.331-1)/3≈4π(0.331)/3≈0.44 cubic parsec. For d=2pc, shell between 2 and 2.1pc: volume≈4π(2.1^3 -2^3)/3≈4π(9.261 -8)/3≈4π*1.261/3≈5.28 cubic parsec. So five times larger volume, but ϖ for d=2 is 0.5, and since ϖ decreases as 1/d, the exact relation might need to be integrated. But translating into parallax per unit volume.

But with the argument being that because the conversion from d to ϖ is non-linear, a given interval in ϖ corresponds to a larger interval in d when d is large (small ϖ). So even though the volume per unit d is higher for larger d, the telescoping of ϖ into smaller and smaller bins as d increases could maybe cause other effects.

But our derivation from calculus suggests that the number per unit ϖ is 4πρ / ϖ^4. So maybe that's indeed correct.

Therefore, the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the inverse fourth power of the parallax, i.e., N ∝ ϖ^{-4}.

**Final Answer**
The number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the parallax. Thus, \boxed{N(\varpi) \propto \varpi^{-4}}.

Since the distribution scales as ϖ⁻⁴, even though the number per unit distance at d scales as d², the conversion to ϖ (which depends on 1/d) creates a steeper relationship.\n\nAn alternative approach considering sampling: The density in parallax space is inversely proportional to the Jacobian of the transformation. Since the transformation from d to ϖ has a Jacobian dd/dϖ ≈ 1/ϖ², but you need to invert that for variable change (since we substitute d into ϖ). The number of stars is conserved in the transformation, thus: N(ϖ) = N(d) * [dd/dϖ]\n\nSince dd/dϖ = |-1/ϖ²|, this leads to again N(ϖ) = 4πρ (1/ϖ^4). Hmm, seems consistent.\n\nWait, actually, N(d) dϖ = N(ϖ) dϖ?\n\nWait no: If N(d) is stars per unit distance, and then you want N(ϖ) as stars per unit parallax, then the two must be related via the chain rule. To maintain equality:\n\nN(ϖ)|dϖ| = N(d)|dd|\n\nWhich means: N(ϖ) = N(d) * |dd/dϖ|\n\nThus, correct. Given N(d) = 4πρ d², substituting d = 1/ϖ:\n\nN(ϖ) = 4πρ (1/ϖ²) * (1/ϖ²) = 4πρ / ϖ^4\n\nThus, stars per unit parallax are proportional to ϖ^-4. Therefore, the distribution decreases rapidly with increasing parallax (which makes sense because higher parallax is closer stars, but due to the smaller volume, there are fewer stars there, but here we need to account for the unit parallax bin).\n\nWait, but wait: when we have higher parallax values (closer stars), smaller distances, and since the number of stars per unit distance increases as d², so between d1 and d2, the count increases. But when converted to parallax, each bin dϖ at higher ϖ (lower d) corresponds to a larger bin dd in distance. Hmm, maybe my confusion is here.\n\nFor a given dϖ, say from ϖ = 1 to ϖ = 1.1, then d = 1 pc to d ≈ 0.909 pc. Thus, a bin size of dd = approximately -0.091 pc. The magnitude of dd is 0.091 pc.\n\nCompare this to a parallax bin dϖ = 0.1 at ϖ=0.1: distance from d=10 pc to d=10.0≈With ϖ=0.1, a dϖ of 0.1 means moving to ϖ=0.2? No, wait parallax increases when distance decreases. If we consider a bin in parallax from ϖ to ϖ + dϖ (assuming dϖ positive), the corresponding distance moves from d =1/ϖ to d=1/(ϖ+dϖ). So the distance bin is dd= 1/(ϖ + dϖ) - 1/ϖ ≈ -dϖ/ϖ²[ via expansion: 1/(ϖ + δϖ) ≈1/ϖ - δϖ/ϖ² ]\n\nThus, for a small dϖ, |dd| ≈ dϖ/ϖ². So, stars in that parallax bin are proportional to N(d)*(dd) = (4πρ d²)* (dϖ/ϖ²) ). But d=1/ϖ, so d²=1/ϖ²\n\nSo substitution gives 4πρ*(1/ϖ²)*(dϖ/ϖ²) = 4πρ dϖ / ϖ^4\n\nThus, stars per unit parallax (after scaling) is 4πρ / ϖ^4 , which is the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit parallax decreases proportional to ϖ^-4, which means progressively larger numbers at smaller parallaxes (more distant stars), but that\'s considering uniform distribution. But isn\'t that the case? If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number increases as we go to larger distances (smaller parallaxes) because even though each shell at larger d has volume 4πd²dd, each subsequent shell in distance is sampled here in parallax, which would be expanding differentially. Wait but upon converting to parallax with N(ϖ) ~ ϖ^-4, that\'s indicating that as ϖ decreases (d increases), the number increases as (1/ϖ)^4. But the cumulative number up to some distance (summing shells) increases as d^3, which when converted to parallax would require integrating ϖ^-4 from some lower limit to a higher limit.\n\nBut when the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax", that\'s the differential count. So as parallax increases (d decreases), that number increases as ϖ^-4. When ϖ increases, the number per unit parallax decreases (since 1/ϖ^4 falls as ϖ grows... wait no, if you have N(ϖ)~ϖ^-4, then as ϖ increases, N(ϖ) decreases? No. For example, at ϖ=1 parsec, N(ϖ)=k*1. For ϖ=2, N= k/16. Wait, high ϖ (closer stars) would decrease the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait this seems conflicting.\n\nHold on:\n\nN(d) = 4πρd², meaning as distance increases, there\'s a quadratic increase in the number per unit distance. So at larger distances, each shell has more stars. So stars per unit distance go up as d².\n\nBut when we move to parallax, what\'s the relation? For small parallax (large d), converting to parallax from distance would invert the relation.\n\nSo in d, supergiant number at large d. However, the distortion caused by the ϖ =1/d relation makes each unit parallax bin correspond to a different size distance bin.\n\nLet me think for example: Suppose we have plx=1 (proxima centauri) and plx=0.1 (distance 10 parsec). A parsec is ~3.26 light-years. For a bin of say ϖ from 1 to 1.1, corresponding to d=1 to d=0.909, giving a bin size of dd=-0.091 pc. In d, that\'s a small volume near us. Compare to a bin from ϖ=0.1 to ϖ=0.11: corresponding to d=10 to ~9.09 pc, a distance bin dd=0.91 pc. So in parallax, bin size is 0.01 in both cases (from 1 to 1.1 is step 0.1 in plx? Wait wait my example inconsistencies.\n\nWait: Actually, the dϖ is a bin size. If I have 1 < ϖ < 1 + dϖ, then per unit parallax dϖ=1. Wait—perhaps it\'s easier to normalize.\n\nIf N(ϖ) = dN/dϖ = 4πρ / ϖ^4, then this is saying that the number density in parallax space falls as ϖ⁻⁴. So higher ϖ = lower d, so nearby stars, but only a small shell then. Since the volume around them is small (d^2 but multiplied by dd, which scales as 1/ϖ²). Thus, despite that, the number is still smaller for higher ϖ.\n\nSo even though bigger volume farther away, the derivative makes this balance such that more stars are observed at lower parallaxes (further distances). Wait, but now if N(ϖ) dϖ is the number between ϖ and ϖ + dϖ, say dϖ=0.1. For small ϖ (d large) such as ϖ=0.1 to 0.2 corresponds to d decreasing from 10 to 5 pc. While for larger ϖ such as ϖ=1 to 1.1, d changes from 1 to ~0.909. So number of stars in ϖ=0.1-0.2 would be integral of N(ϖ) dϖ over that, which equals ∫ (4πρ) / ϖ^4 dϖ = 4πρ [ -1/(3ϖ³) ] from 0.1 to 0.2=4πρ [ ( -1/(3*(0.2)^3) ) - (-1/(3*(0.1)^3) ) ] = 4πρ [ 1/(3*(0.001) - 1/(3*0.008) ) ] = 4πρ [ (1/0.003 - 1/0.024 ) / 3 ]... much larger than integrating at high ϖ. Hence, confirmation that if uniform, the number of stars increases at lower ϖ (farther away), which fits with N(ϖ)~ϖ⁻⁴\n\nAnother perspective: the differential number increases as parallax decreases. Hence in a histogram of parallaxes, we expect a peak at low parallax (many distant stars translating into higher numbers in low parallax bins) if stars are uniformly distributed.\n\nBut wait, under uniform density (which may not be the case in reality), you would think more stars are far away. Which is the case here.\n\nBut then how does that translate into parallax distribution. Since as ϖ=1/d, the differential number transforms proportional to d² * |dd/dϖ| = d² * 1/ϖ² = d² * d² (since d =1/ϖ) => d^4= (1/ϖ)^4, i.e., with N(ϖ)~ϖ^-4.\n\nTherefore:N(ϖ) scales as 1/ϖ⁴.\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit parallax should DECREASE as the inverse fourth power of parallax. But if viewed as a function, for example, in reality, when you do a star survey, you find fewer stars at higher parallaxes (closer stars)?\n\nBut with uniform density, FURTHER stars can have a lot of numbers if the shell has a large volume. Given volume must scale as distance^3? But for infinitesimal shell it\'s distance^2. Because a shell\'s volume implies 4πr² dr. Thus, further shells are larger.\n\nBut when passing from distance to parallax, each shell maps different.\n\nHold on, maybe my confusion here comes from visualization. If I have stars uniformly distributed in space, then at a distance d, their number in a shell dr is volume * density. Thus, stars per unit distance interval is 4πr² ρ dr. So as dr increases, number of stars increases, but this is per unit dr. Now, if we transform to parallax, which dr = (1/ϖ²) dϖ (in magnitude),\n\nThus, for stars per unit parallax, dr(ϖ) = 1/ϖ² dϖ.\n\nWait so substituting into the original number, which is 4πr²ρ dr. Then substituting dr with 1/ϖ² dϖ and r with 1/ϖ, we get stars per dϖ =4π (1/ϖ²)² ρ (1/ϖ²) dϖ = 4π ρ/ϖ^4 dϖ. Thus, accelerating to N(ϖ) = 4πρ / ϖ⁴.\n\nTherefore, stars per unit parallx, dN/dϖ = K / ϖ⁴.\n\nThis pre-polulates that there are many more stars at low ϖ (distant), but also higher numbers. However, this contradicts usual reasoning when considering the luminosity function where nearby stars are easier to see.\n\nBut in reality, stars aren\'t uniformly distributed. The Galaxy has structure, density decreasing with distance from the galactic plane, etc. However, in the question\'s assumption, they are uniformly distributed.\n\nTherefore, under hypothetical, the number of stars per unit parallax would increase inversely as the fourth power of parallax. But how to parse this. If we consider the parallax distribution functions, dN/dϖ ~ ϖ^-4. So assuming you create a histogram of parallax measurements, the number in each bin (of parallax) would scale as ϖ^-4. So lower ϖ (generated by bigger distances) wields higher counts, but how does this interact that there is  more volume.\n\nBut indeed, the declining number with higher ϖ is exact—the number per unit parallax is higher at the smaller parallax ranges.\n\nBut why does dN/dϖ drop as ϖ^-4?\n\nBecause the transform from d to ϖ leads to the dependence; while more volume at larger d, the bin in ϖ corresponds to the varying intervals in d. Because for a given delta_ϖ, the corresponding delta_d is larger for smaller d (high ϖ), so the size of the space populated by a given bin width in ϖ isn\'t fixed. Since at high ϖ (small d), a delta_ϖ of, say 0.1, corresponds to smaller delta_d (but here complex relations: delta_d ~ delta_ϖ / ϖ^2, so higher ϖ (smaller d) gives a smaller delta_d.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s more illustrative to take concrete numbers:\n\nTake parallax ϖ1 = 1 arcsec (d =1 pc), and a bin from ϖ1=1 to ϖ2=1.1 (d=0.909 pc, so dd=0.091 pc)\n\nAnother bin at ϖ1=0.5 (d=2 pc), bin width 0.1 arcsec equivalent step from ϖ: 0.5 to 0.6, corresponding to d from 2 pc to 1.666 pc, delta_d= -0.333 pc, so delta_p=0.1 corresponds to delta_d=1/0.5 -1/(0.5+0.1))= 2 - 1.666=0.333\n\nFor each bin, at zone ϖ=1, the volume is 4πr² dr, around r=1 pc, dr=0.091 pc\n\nAt zone ϖ=0.5, delta_ϖ=0.1, the volume is 4π* (approx. 2 pc)^2 * 0.333 pc=4π*4 *0.333≈16.755 pc³\n\nCompare to the other bin: 4π*(1 pc)^2 *0.091≈1.145 pc³\n\nSo there\'s way more stars in the lower ϖ bin (which seems high-wthick distance ranges). But stars per delta_ϖ is the count divided by delta_ϖ (0.1). But since we had to segment by delta_ϖ, which is 0.1 in both processes, the respective counts would be higher at lower ϖ (but note that at [.1 to .2.... higher blabla]\n\nHowever, according to our formula, N(ϖ) =4πρ/ϖ^4. So N(ϖ=1) = K, 1/1⁴=1 times const) and N(ϖ=0.5)= K/(0.5^4)=16K. Which implies that stars per unit parallax interval at pi=0.5 is 16 times larger than at pi=1, which the volumes in our example: 16 times compares to our 16.755/1.145 ≈14.6—about the same order (depending on exact number), a factor of 16 (despite our particular example not matching exactly due to neglect). Given this approximate agreement, the formula dN/dϖ ∝ 1/ϖ^4 seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the number of stars per unit range of parallax increases as parallax decreases, specifically proportional to 1/plx^4.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The number of stars per unit range of parallax (Δϖ) decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of parallax (ϖ⁻⁴) under the assumption of uniform stellar distribution. This relationship arises from the transformation between distance (d) and parallax (ϖ = 1/d), combined with the volume element in three-dimensional space. 

**Derivation Summary:**
1. **Volume Element in Distance:**  
   For a spherical shell of thickness Δd at distance d, the volume is approximately \(4\pi d^2 \Delta d\). The number of stars in this shell scales as \(d^2\) for uniform density.

2. **Parallax-Distance Relation:**  
   Substituting \(d = 1/\varpi\) and using the differential relation \((\Delta d \approx \Delta\varpi / \varpi^2)\), the volume transforms to \((4\pi / \varpi^4) \Delta\varpi\).

3. **Stars per Unit Parallax:**  
   This results in the number of stars per unit parallax scaling as \(dN/d\varpi \propto \varpi^{-4}\).

**Conclusion:**  
The distribution peaks sharply towards smaller parallaxes (farther distances), reflecting the **1/ϖ⁴ dependence**. Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as \(\boxed{\varpi^{-4}}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 But actually, since higher parallax means closer star, so lower d. Since the distribution scales as ϖ⁻⁴, even though the number per unit distance at d scales as d², the conversion to ϖ (which depends on 1/d) creates a steeper relationship.

An alternative approach considering sampling: The density in parallax space is inversely proportional to the Jacobian of the transformation. Since the transformation from d to ϖ has a Jacobian dd/dϖ ≈ 1/ϖ², but you need to invert that for variable change (since we substitute d into ϖ). The number of stars is conserved in the transformation, thus: N(ϖ) = N(d) * [dd/dϖ]

Since dd/dϖ = |-1/ϖ²|, this leads to again N(ϖ) = 4πρ (1/ϖ^4). Hmm, seems consistent.

Wait, actually, N(d) dϖ = N(ϖ) dϖ?

Wait no: If N(d) is stars per unit distance, and then you want N(ϖ) as stars per unit parallax, then the two must be related via the chain rule. To maintain equality:

N(ϖ)|dϖ| = N(d)|dd|

Which means: N(ϖ) = N(d) * |dd/dϖ|

Thus, correct. Given N(d) = 4πρ d², substituting d = 1/ϖ:

N(ϖ) = 4πρ (1/ϖ²) * (1/ϖ²) = 4πρ / ϖ^4

Thus, stars per unit parallax are proportional to ϖ^-4. Therefore, the distribution decreases rapidly with increasing parallax (which makes sense because higher parallax is closer stars, but due to the smaller volume, there are fewer stars there, but here we need to account for the unit parallax bin).

Wait, but wait: when we have higher parallax values (closer stars), smaller distances, and since the number of stars per unit distance increases as d², so between d1 and d2, the count increases. But when converted to parallax, each bin dϖ at higher ϖ (lower d) corresponds to a larger bin dd in distance. Hmm, maybe my confusion is here.

For a given dϖ, say from ϖ = 1 to ϖ = 1.1, then d = 1 pc to d ≈ 0.909 pc. Thus, a bin size of dd = approximately -0.091 pc. The magnitude of dd is 0.091 pc.

Compare this to a parallax bin dϖ = 0.1 at ϖ=0.1: distance from d=10 pc to d=10.0≈With ϖ=0.1, a dϖ of 0.1 means moving to ϖ=0.2? No, wait parallax increases when distance decreases. If we consider a bin in parallax from ϖ to ϖ + dϖ (assuming dϖ positive), the corresponding distance moves from d =1/ϖ to d=1/(ϖ+dϖ). So the distance bin is dd= 1/(ϖ + dϖ) - 1/ϖ ≈ -dϖ/ϖ²[ via expansion: 1/(ϖ + δϖ) ≈1/ϖ - δϖ/ϖ² ]

Thus, for a small dϖ, |dd| ≈ dϖ/ϖ². So, stars in that parallax bin are proportional to N(d)*(dd) = (4πρ d²)* (dϖ/ϖ²) ). But d=1/ϖ, so d²=1/ϖ²

So substitution gives 4πρ*(1/ϖ²)*(dϖ/ϖ²) = 4πρ dϖ / ϖ^4

Thus, stars per unit parallax (after scaling) is 4πρ / ϖ^4 , which is the same conclusion.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax decreases proportional to ϖ^-4, which means progressively larger numbers at smaller parallaxes (more distant stars), but that's considering uniform distribution. But isn't that the case? If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number increases as we go to larger distances (smaller parallaxes) because even though each shell at larger d has volume 4πd²dd, each subsequent shell in distance is sampled here in parallax, which would be expanding differentially. Wait but upon converting to parallax with N(ϖ) ~ ϖ^-4, that's indicating that as ϖ decreases (d increases), the number increases as (1/ϖ)^4. But the cumulative number up to some distance (summing shells) increases as d^3, which when converted to parallax would require integrating ϖ^-4 from some lower limit to a higher limit.

But when the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax", that's the differential count. So as parallax increases (d decreases), that number increases as ϖ^-4. When ϖ increases, the number per unit parallax decreases (since 1/ϖ^4 falls as ϖ grows... wait no, if you have N(ϖ)~ϖ^-4, then as ϖ increases, N(ϖ) decreases? No. For example, at ϖ=1 parsec, N(ϖ)=k*1. For ϖ=2, N= k/16. Wait, high ϖ (closer stars) would decrease the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait this seems conflicting.

Hold on:

N(d) = 4πρd², meaning as distance increases, there's a quadratic increase in the number per unit distance. So at larger distances, each shell has more stars. So stars per unit distance go up as d².

But when we move to parallax, what's the relation? For small parallax (large d), converting to parallax from distance would invert the relation.

So in d, supergiant number at large d. However, the distortion caused by the ϖ =1/d relation makes each unit parallax bin correspond to a different size distance bin.

Let me think for example: Suppose we have plx=1 (proxima centauri) and plx=0.1 (distance 10 parsec). A parsec is ~3.26 light-years. For a bin of say ϖ from 1 to 1.1, corresponding to d=1 to d=0.909, giving a bin size of dd=-0.091 pc. In d, that's a small volume near us. Compare to a bin from ϖ=0.1 to ϖ=0.11: corresponding to d=10 to ~9.09 pc, a distance bin dd=0.91 pc. So in parallax, bin size is 0.01 in both cases (from 1 to 1.1 is step 0.1 in plx? Wait wait my example inconsistencies.

Wait: Actually, the dϖ is a bin size. If I have 1 < ϖ < 1 + dϖ, then per unit parallax dϖ=1. Wait—perhaps it's easier to normalize.

If N(ϖ) = dN/dϖ = 4πρ / ϖ^4, then this is saying that the number density in parallax space falls as ϖ⁻⁴. So higher ϖ = lower d, so nearby stars, but only a small shell then. Since the volume around them is small (d^2 but multiplied by dd, which scales as 1/ϖ²). Thus, despite that, the number is still smaller for higher ϖ.

So even though bigger volume farther away, the derivative makes this balance such that more stars are observed at lower parallaxes (further distances). Wait, but now if N(ϖ) dϖ is the number between ϖ and ϖ + dϖ, say dϖ=0.1. For small ϖ (d large) such as ϖ=0.1 to 0.2 corresponds to d decreasing from 10 to 5 pc. While for larger ϖ such as ϖ=1 to 1.1, d changes from 1 to ~0.909. So number of stars in ϖ=0.1-0.2 would be integral of N(ϖ) dϖ over that, which equals ∫ (4πρ) / ϖ^4 dϖ = 4πρ [ -1/(3ϖ³) ] from 0.1 to 0.2=4πρ [ ( -1/(3*(0.2)^3) ) - (-1/(3*(0.1)^3) ) ] = 4πρ [ 1/(3*(0.001) - 1/(3*0.008) ) ] = 4πρ [ (1/0.003 - 1/0.024 ) / 3 ]... much larger than integrating at high ϖ. Hence, confirmation that if uniform, the number of stars increases at lower ϖ (farther away), which fits with N(ϖ)~ϖ⁻⁴

Another perspective: the differential number increases as parallax decreases. Hence in a histogram of parallaxes, we expect a peak at low parallax (many distant stars translating into higher numbers in low parallax bins) if stars are uniformly distributed.

But wait, under uniform density (which may not be the case in reality), you would think more stars are far away. Which is the case here.

But then how does that translate into parallax distribution. Since as ϖ=1/d, the differential number transforms proportional to d² * |dd/dϖ| = d² * 1/ϖ² = d² * d² (since d =1/ϖ) => d^4= (1/ϖ)^4, i.e., with N(ϖ)~ϖ^-4.

Therefore:N(ϖ) scales as 1/ϖ⁴.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit parallax should DECREASE as the inverse fourth power of parallax. But if viewed as a function, for example, in reality, when you do a star survey, you find fewer stars at higher parallaxes (closer stars)?

But with uniform density, FURTHER stars can have a lot of numbers if the shell has a large volume. Given volume must scale as distance^3? But for infinitesimal shell it's distance^2. Because a shell's volume implies 4πr² dr. Thus, further shells are larger.

But when passing from distance to parallax, each shell maps different.

Hold on, maybe my confusion here comes from visualization. If I have stars uniformly distributed in space, then at a distance d, their number in a shell dr is volume * density. Thus, stars per unit distance interval is 4πr² ρ dr. So as dr increases, number of stars increases, but this is per unit dr. Now, if we transform to parallax, which dr = (1/ϖ²) dϖ (in magnitude),

Thus, for stars per unit parallax, dr(ϖ) = 1/ϖ² dϖ.

Wait so substituting into the original number, which is 4πr²ρ dr. Then substituting dr with 1/ϖ² dϖ and r with 1/ϖ, we get stars per dϖ =4π (1/ϖ²)² ρ (1/ϖ²) dϖ = 4π ρ/ϖ^4 dϖ. Thus, accelerating to N(ϖ) = 4πρ / ϖ⁴.

Therefore, stars per unit parallx, dN/dϖ = K / ϖ⁴.

This pre-polulates that there are many more stars at low ϖ (distant), but also higher numbers. However, this contradicts usual reasoning when considering the luminosity function where nearby stars are easier to see.

But in reality, stars aren't uniformly distributed. The Galaxy has structure, density decreasing with distance from the galactic plane, etc. However, in the question's assumption, they are uniformly distributed.

Therefore, under hypothetical, the number of stars per unit parallax would increase inversely as the fourth power of parallax. But how to parse this. If we consider the parallax distribution functions, dN/dϖ ~ ϖ^-4. So assuming you create a histogram of parallax measurements, the number in each bin (of parallax) would scale as ϖ^-4. So lower ϖ (generated by bigger distances) wields higher counts, but how does this interact that there is  more volume.

But indeed, the declining number with higher ϖ is exact—the number per unit parallax is higher at the smaller parallax ranges.

But why does dN/dϖ drop as ϖ^-4?

Because the transform from d to ϖ leads to the dependence; while more volume at larger d, the bin in ϖ corresponds to the varying intervals in d. Because for a given delta_ϖ, the corresponding delta_d is larger for smaller d (high ϖ), so the size of the space populated by a given bin width in ϖ isn't fixed. Since at high ϖ (small d), a delta_ϖ of, say 0.1, corresponds to smaller delta_d (but here complex relations: delta_d ~ delta_ϖ / ϖ^2, so higher ϖ (smaller d) gives a smaller delta_d.

Wait, maybe it's more illustrative to take concrete numbers:

Take parallax ϖ1 = 1 arcsec (d =1 pc), and a bin from ϖ1=1 to ϖ2=1.1 (d=0.909 pc, so dd=0.091 pc)

Another bin at ϖ1=0.5 (d=2 pc), bin width 0.1 arcsec equivalent step from ϖ: 0.5 to 0.6, corresponding to d from 2 pc to 1.666 pc, delta_d= -0.333 pc, so delta_p=0.1 corresponds to delta_d=1/0.5 -1/(0.5+0.1))= 2 - 1.666=0.333

For each bin, at zone ϖ=1, the volume is 4πr² dr, around r=1 pc, dr=0.091 pc

At zone ϖ=0.5, delta_ϖ=0.1, the volume is 4π* (approx. 2 pc)^2 * 0.333 pc=4π*4 *0.333≈16.755 pc³

Compare to the other bin: 4π*(1 pc)^2 *0.091≈1.145 pc³

So there's way more stars in the lower ϖ bin (which seems high-wthick distance ranges). But stars per delta_ϖ is the count divided by delta_ϖ (0.1). But since we had to segment by delta_ϖ, which is 0.1 in both processes, the respective counts would be higher at lower ϖ (but note that at [.1 to .2.... higher blabla]

However, according to our formula, N(ϖ) =4πρ/ϖ^4. So N(ϖ=1) = K, 1/1⁴=1 times const) and N(ϖ=0.5)= K/(0.5^4)=16K. Which implies that stars per unit parallax interval at pi=0.5 is 16 times larger than at pi=1, which the volumes in our example: 16 times compares to our 16.755/1.145 ≈14.6—about the same order (depending on exact number), a factor of 16 (despite our particular example not matching exactly due to neglect). Given this approximate agreement, the formula dN/dϖ ∝ 1/ϖ^4 seems correct.

Therefore, the answer would be that the number of stars per unit range of parallax increases as parallax decreases, specifically proportional to 1/plx^4. So mathematically, dN/d(plx) ∝ plx^{-4}

Therefore, when you plot dN/d(plx) against plx, it would be a steeply declining curve towards higher parallax. Even though each shell with larger radius contributes more stars, they contribute over a correspondingly larger interval in parallax. Due to the dependence of the transformation.

So the conclusion would be: up to the constant of proportionality involving the stellar density and 4π, the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with the inverse fourth power of parallax. Hence, stars are more numerous at smaller parallaxes (since per unit parallax bin, which corresponds to larger distances/shells).

Hence, even though close. As per. Thus, in uniform density, the answer would be dN/dplx ∝ plx^{-4}.

So the answer should be that the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases proportional to plx^{-4}.

Yes, this matches the calculation. Stars per unit parallax scale as ϖ^-4.

Maybe there\'s a mistake.\n\nOriginal relation:\n\nN(d) = number per unit distance = ρ * 4π d²\n\nTherefore, with D as a distance, N(D) = 4πρD².\n\nBut when we convert to parallax ϖ = 1/D, and need N(ϖ).\n\nThe correct method using variable transformation is as follows.\n\nLet N_d(D) dD = number of stars between D and D + dD = 4πρ D² dD.\n\nLet’s express N_ϖ(ϖ) dϖ = N_d(D) dD.\n\nSince ϖ =1/D, D=1/ϖ, and dD = - (1/ϖ²) dϖ, thus in terms of absolute value, dD = (1/ϖ²) dϖ.\n\nHence, N_ϖ(ϖ) dϖ = 4πρ (1/ϖ)² * (1/ϖ²) dϖ = 4πρ / ϖ^4 dϖ.\n\nTherefore, N_ϖ(ϖ) = 4πρ / ϖ^4\n\nTherefore, the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to ϖ^4. Thus, N(ϖ) ~ ϖ^-4.\n\nThis seems the result, but does this make sense?\n\nSuppose a star at 1 pc, ϖ=1 arcsec.

Hence, lower ϖ (further distance) is associated with higher numbers per unit ϖ.\n\nBut wait, if you have a fixed interval in parallax: say 0.1 to 0.2 arcsec (so Δϖ=0.1). The distance range would be from 5pc to 10pc. The volume being considered is a shell between 5pc and 10pc. The volume here is (4π/3)(10³ - 5³) = (4π/3)(1000 - 125) = (4π/3)(875) ≈ 3665 pc³.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with parallax, we start by noting the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax is given by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. 

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius \( d \) and thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell. The volume of such a shell is \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance \( d \) is proportional to \( d^2 \).

To convert this to a function of parallax, we use the transformation \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). The volume element in terms of parallax is found by differentiating \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), giving \( dd = \frac{-1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \). Taking the absolute value (since we are interested in magnitude), we have \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \).

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \) into the volume element, the number of stars per unit parallax is:
\[
N(\text{plx}) \, d\text{plx} = \rho \cdot 4\pi \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \right) d\text{plx}
\]
where \( \rho \) is the stellar density. Simplifying this, we find:
\[
N(\text{plx}) \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Wait, no: since integrating over ϖ from high to low would correspond to integrating over distance approaching infinity. Wait, actually, considering that as d approaches infinity, ϖ approaches zero.

Therefore, low parallax corresponds to far distance, high parallax is close. So if N(ϖ) is proportional to 1/ϖ^4, then in terms of ϖ= 1/d, this function would peak at low ϖ (high distances), meaning more stars per unit parallax at the lower end. But parallax ranges from 0 to some upper maximum (so distance from some d min to infinity). However, that seems like a problem because does that mean that the closest stars (highest ϖ) would have the least number per unit ϖ?

Let me think again. Maybe there's a mistake.

Original relation:

N(d) = number per unit distance = ρ * 4π d²

Therefore, with D as a distance, N(D) = 4πρD².

But when we convert to parallax ϖ = 1/D, and need N(ϖ).

The correct method using variable transformation is as follows.

Let N_d(D) dD = number of stars between D and D + dD = 4πρ D² dD.

Let’s express N_ϖ(ϖ) dϖ = N_d(D) dD.

Since ϖ =1/D, D=1/ϖ, and dD = - (1/ϖ²) dϖ, thus in terms of absolute value, dD = (1/ϖ²) dϖ.

Hence, N_ϖ(ϖ) dϖ = 4πρ (1/ϖ)² * (1/ϖ²) dϖ = 4πρ / ϖ^4 dϖ.

Therefore, N_ϖ(ϖ) = 4πρ / ϖ^4

Therefore, the number per unit parallax is inversely proportional to ϖ^4. Thus, N(ϖ) ~ ϖ^-4.

This seems the result, but does this make sense?

Suppose a star at 1 pc, ϖ=1 arcsec. Then stars with higher parallax (closer than 1 pc) would have ϖ greater than 1, but this formula suggests that the number of stars per unit ϖ decreases drastically (as 1/ϖ^4) when you go to the closer stars (higher ϖ).

But say, if ϖ is high (closer stars), ϖ is larger, so N(ϖ) is smaller— which matches with intuition: very nearby stars (very high parallax) are very few, and as you go to smaller parallaxes (farther), the number per parallax interval increases, but how?

Wait, no, according to formula N(plx) increases as parallax decreases. Let's parse value:

For example, at ϖ=0.1 arcsec (distance 10 pc), N(ϖ) is proportional to 1/(0.1)^4 = 10,000.

At ϖ=0.2 arcsec (distance 5 pc), proportional to 1/(0.2)^4 = 625/16 ≈ 39.0625.

Hence, per unit ϖ (e.g., per 0.1 arcsec interval), at ϖ=0.1 there would be approximately 10,000 units (proportional), but at ϖ=0.2, it would be ~39 units. Hence, lower ϖ (further distance) is associated with higher numbers per unit ϖ.

But wait, if you have a fixed interval in parallax: say 0.1 to 0.2 arcsec (so Δϖ=0.1). The distance range would be from 5pc to 10pc. The volume being considered is a shell between 5pc and 10pc. The volume here is (4π/3)(10³ - 5³) = (4π/3)(1000 - 125) = (4π/3)(875) ≈ 3665 pc³. Comparing this to a shell between 1pc and 2pc (translating to ϖ=1 to ϖ=0.5):

Volume here is (4π/3)(8 -1) ≈ 29.3 pc³, which is much less.

But if using N(ϖ) ~1/ϖ^4, then when calculating N between ϖ=1 and 0.5:

 N = ∫_{0.5}^{1} C / ϖ^4 dϖ = C [ 1/(3*0.5^3) - 1/(3*1^3) ] = C [ 8/3 - 1/3 ] = (7/3)C

Similarly, between ϖ=0.1 and 0.2:

N = ∫_{0.1}^{0.2} C / ϖ^4 dϖ = C [ 1/(3*0.1^3) - 1/(3*0.2^3) ] = C [ 1000/3 - 125/3 ] = (875/3)C ≈ 291.7 C

Indeed, more stars in the farther parallax bins (lower ϖ). Hence, this leads to the number per unit parallaz increasing as ϖ decreases. So considering per unit ϖ, N(ϖ) is higher for smaller ϖ.

But the original N(D) ~ D² so the number per distance bin increased with increasing D, but as distance increases, parallax decreasing, and their relation is N ϖ ~ 1/ ϖ^4. Therefore, the result holds that the number per parallax unit vs. ϖ in plausible.

But another approach: think about a small annulus in parallax. For instance, a Δϖ interval corresponds to a shell in distance with Δd. The number of stars in that shell would be proportional to d² Δd, but since Δd relates to Δϖ via d =1/ ϖ --> Δd = (Δϖ) / ϖ² (by differentiation).

Then substituting Δd = Δϖ / ϖ², the number becomes proportional to d² * (Δϖ / ϖ² ) = (1/ ϖ²) * ( Δϖ / ϖ² ) = Δϖ / ϖ^4.

Hence, number per Δϖ is proportional to 1 / ϖ^4, supporting the previous result.

So the conclusion N(ϖ) ~ 1 / ϖ^4 seems solid.

But is that contradicting what we know? For Gaia observations we see that at small parallaxes (large distances) the numbers of stars increase, but spectra cover to gain sensitivity changing the scaling.

Wait, for uniform density in space, the expected number of stars per parallax should decrease as ϖ^-4.

Therefore, in the article "Gaia's view of the Milky Way", for example, the number increases as distance cubed (from some reference), but in reality source density of course isn't uniform or may be limited by observing constraints.

But putting that aside, in the ideal, uniformly distributed stars, the article is inverse fourth-power.

So perhaps the answer is that the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to plx^-4, so N(plx) \propto plx^{-4}.

But to check dimensional analysis. Let’s make sure.

If N(d) dd is 1/ϖ^4 dϖ, with plx in inverse parsec. Is that so?

Yes: for plx (arcseconds) equal to 1/d (parsecs)

So ϖ in arcsec, d in parsecs.

D units of plx is 1/pc. So if integrating over plx, unit would be (stars) per (1/pc).

Wait, but since you are measuring per linear (in plx) interval.

Hmm.

Wait, let’s do it formally.

Let’s have f(ϖ) dϖ = number of stars between ϖ and ϖ + dϖ.

We have f(ϖ) = density in ϖ-space × volume element.

Relation between space density ρ (stars/pc³) and f(ϖ) is:

The total number in dϖ is ρ × volume of the shell at radius d = 1/ϖ, thickness dd.

volume = 4π d² dd.

But dd = |dd/dϖ| dϖ = | -1/ϖ² | dϖ = dϖ / ϖ².

Thus, Volume = 4π (1/ϖ²) (dϖ / ϖ²) ) = 4π dϖ / ϖ^4.

Therefore, f(ϖ) dϖ = 4πρ dϖ / ϖ^4.

Thus, f(ϖ) = 4πρ / ϖ^4.

Thus, the number per unit parallex is inversely proportional to 4th power of ϖ.

Hence, the answer is N ∝ ϖ^{-4}

Yes that makes sense. So as ϖ decreases, N(ϖ) peaks sharply higher, but only up to certain limit.

But wait, if you consider that each unit range of ϖ, the number appears very large. But at the same time, if N(ϖ) isn't caring for sky area, since assuming all sky counts (all directions)—but that okay, in the calculation Volume is 4π...

Therefore, in summary, plausible.

Hence, detail check seems good.

**Final Answer**

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the parallax. Thus, it changes as \boxed{N(\text{plx}) \propto \text{plx}^{-4}}.
