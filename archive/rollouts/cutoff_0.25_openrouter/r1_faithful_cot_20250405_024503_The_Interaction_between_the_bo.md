The interaction Lagrangian given is \(\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\). This describes the coupling of the boson \(X\) to fermions \(\psi_f\) through a Yukawa interaction. The mass of the boson \(X\) is 6 GeV. To determine the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order, we need to consider fermion pairs whose combined mass does not exceed 6 GeV.

1. **Fermion Masses**: The mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to 3 GeV for the decay \(X \to \psi_f \bar{\psi}_f\) to be kinematically allowed. The relevant fermion masses are:
   - Leptons: \(e^\pm\) (0.511 MeV), \(\mu^\pm\) (105.7 MeV), \(\tau^\pm\) (1.777 GeV)
   - Quarks: \(u\) (2.2 MeV), \(d\) (4.7 MeV), \(s\) (96 MeV), \(c\) (1.27 GeV)

2. **Kinematically Allowed Decays**: Each fermion-antifermion pair must satisfy \(2m_f \leq 6\) GeV. The masses of the listed fermions are all below 3 GeV, making the following decays kinematically allowed:
   - Leptons: \(X \to e^+ e^-\), \(X \to \mu^+ \mu^-\), \(X \to \tau^+ \tau^-\)
   - Quarks: \(X \to c \bar{c}\), \(X \to s \bar{s}\), \(X \to u \bar{u}\), \(X \to d \bar{d}\)

3. **Conclusion**: The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \(X\) at the lowest order involve all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV. This includes both lepton pairs and quark pairs.

\[\boxed{X \to e^+ e^-, \ \mu^+ \mu^-, \ \tau^+ \tau^-, \ c \bar{c}, \ s \bar{s}, \ u \bar{u}, \ d \bar{d}}\]

Alright, so I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson X and some fermion fields ψ_f. The term has a coupling constant λ_f and it's multiplied by (v + X), so when X is in the interaction, it's coupling to the fermions. The parameter v is probably the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of some field, maybe the Higgs? But maybe not necessarily. Maybe X is a scalar boson interacting with the fermions through a Yukawa coupling.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Kinematically allowed decays depend on the masses of the decay products. At the lowest order, so tree-level processes, the boson X can decay into pairs of particles if their combined mass is less than or equal to the mass of X.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is of the form X \bar{\psi}_f ψ_f, so the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. That suggests that the decay would be X → ψ_f + \bar{\ψ}_f, right? Because in terms of Feynman diagrams, the boson would split into a fermion-antifermion pair.

But wait, fermions are usually massive, so the mass of the fermion ψ_f must be such that 2m_f ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, the fermion's mass m_f has to be ≤ 3 GeV. Otherwise, the decay is not kinematically allowed.

So the question is, which standard model fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Since the problem doesn't specify otherwise, maybe we assume standard model fermions unless specified. Let me recall the masses of the fermions:

Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.511 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up quark: ~2.2 MeV
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV
- Strange quark: ~96 MeV
- Top quark: ~173 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.18 GeV

But quarks are confined, so the decays would be into hadrons. However, maybe in this model, ψ_f can be any fermion, including quarks? But since X is a boson with 6 GeV mass, if it's a scalar (which I might need to confirm), maybe similar to the Higgs. The Higgs can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the fermion mass is less than half the Higgs mass.

Wait, the Higgs is 125 GeV. So the top quark, with 173 GeV, can't be decayed into by the Higgs. But other fermions with masses below 62.5 GeV could be possible. But in our case, the X boson is 6 GeV. So the maximum mass of the fermion it can decay into would be 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses, only the tau lepton is 1.777 GeV, which is below 3 GeV. The charm quark is about 1.27 GeV, also below 3 GeV. However, the bottom quark is 4.18 GeV, so too heavy. The top quark is way too heavy. So quarks like charm, strange, down, up, etc., are all below 3 GeV. So X could decay into pairs of charm-anticharm, strange-antis strange, etc. If ψ_f includes all these fermions.

But wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to fermions proportional to their mass. However, the interaction here is written as -λ_f \bar{\ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. If v is a VEV, then when X is zero, the term becomes -λ_f v \bar{\ψ}_f ψ_f, meaning that the mass of the fermion is m_f = λ_f v. This is like the Yukawa interaction. So the mass of each fermion is determined by λ_f v. Then, depending on λ_f, the coupling is fixed.

But in this problem, the mass of X is 6 GeV. To determine possible decay channels, the possible fermions must satisfy 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV, so m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Even though the fermions could include heavier ones if the coupling exists, but kinematically, only those with m_f ≤3 GeV can be decay products.

In the Standard Model, below 3 GeV, the fermions are:

Leptons: e, μ, τ (τ is 1.777 GeV, so allowed), so tau is allowed. Then, among quarks: up, down, strange, charm. Charm quark is around 1.27 GeV, which is allowed. So, in terms of quark-antiquark pairs, X could decay into c c-bar, s s-bar, etc. But for quarks, these would form hadrons rather than free particles. But in the context of particle physics, even though the quarks are confined, the decay would be considered as X → quark + antiquark, which then hadronize. So in terms of fundamental processes, those would still be allowed.

However, the problem may be considering whether X can decay into tau pairs, charm quark pairs, etc. Tau has a mass of about 1.777 GeV, so two taus would have a combined mass of about 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Therefore, X → τ+ τ- is allowed.

For the charm quark, each has 1.27 GeV, so two would sum to approximately 2.54 GeV, which is well below 6 GeV. Similarly, for the bottom quark, but bottom quark mass is 4.18 GeV, so two would need 8.36 GeV, exceeding 6 GeV. Therefore, X cannot decay into bottom-antibottom.

But the problem states that the mass of X is 6 GeV, so can X decay into a pair of bottom quarks? Since 4.18 * 2 = 8.36 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV, hence no.

Similarly for top quarks, they are way too heavy.

Thus, kinematically allowed decays would be into fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV. Let's list them:

Leptons:
- Electron-positron (e+ e-): mass 0.511 MeV each, so definitely allowed.
- Muon-antimuon (μ+ μ-): ~105.7 MeV each, allowed.
- Tau-antitau (τ+ τ-): 1.777 GeV each, sum to ~3.55 GeV < 6 GeV, so allowed.

Quarks (forming hadrons):
- Up quark-antiquark (u ū): negligible mass, allowed.
- Down quark-antiquark (d đ): same.
- Strange quark-antiquark (s ś): ~96 MeV each, allowed.
- Charm quark-antiquark (c c̄): ~1.27 GeV each, allowed.

But wait, the quarks will hadronize, but the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So as per the fundamental interaction, X couples to these fermions, and if their mass is less than 3 GeV, those decays are possible.

But another thing to consider is whether the coupling λ_f exists for these fermions.

In the given Lagrangian, it's L(y) = -λ_f \barψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. The subscript f suggests that different fermions have different coupling constants λ_f. However, the problem doesn't specify which fermions are actually present in the model. If X couples to all fermions, then all applicable fermions with m_f ≤ 3 GeV would be allowed. But if, for example, X only couples to certain fermions, that would restrict the decays. However, the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on the fermions. It just says "ψ_f" which might imply any fermion.

But in the Standard Model, the Higgs boson couples to all massive fermions, with couplings proportional to their masses. If this model is similar, then heavier fermions have larger couplings. But kinematically, even though allowed, whether the decay happens depends on both phase space and the coupling strength. However, the question is about kinematically allowed decays, not their branching ratios or coupling-dependent probabilities. So we just need to list all channels where 2m_f ≤ m_X =6 GeV.

So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion mass is ≤3 GeV. Thus, the possible decays would be:

- X → e+ e-
- X → μ+ μ-
- X → τ+ τ-
- X → c c̄ (which would hadronize into charmed mesons, etc.)
- X → s ś (strange mesons)
- X → u ū and X → d đ (but these would be light quarks forming pion-like particles)

However, in practice, for very light fermions (like e, μ, u, d, s), the coupling λ_f is proportional to m_f (if v is the VEV), so for lighter fermions, the coupling is weaker. However, kinematically, they are still allowed. The problem states "kinematically allowed decays at lowest order," so regardless of the coupling strength, we just check if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

But let's confirm if X is a scalar or a vector boson. The interaction term is scalar: X is multiplied by \barψψ, which is a scalar. Therefore, X would be a scalar boson. So in that case, the decay would be a scalar going to fermion-antifermion, which requires the fermions to be massive, since a scalar cannot decay into massless fermions (angular momentum conservation). But here, ψ_f could be any fermion. But even for massive fermions, the decay amplitude is proportional to the fermion mass. Wait, in the Lagrangian, the coupling is λ_f (v + X) \barψ_f ψ_f. If we expand it, it's the Yukawa coupling. The interaction term is λ_f X \barψψ, and the mass term is λ_f v\barψψ. So the mass of the fermion is m_f = λ_f v, and the coupling of X to ψ_f is λ_f m_f / v? Wait, wait. If m_f = λ_f v, then λ_f = m_f / v, so the coupling λ_f X \barψψ becomes (m_f / v) X \barψψ. So the coupling is proportional to m_f. Therefore, even though all fermions with m_f ≤ 3 GeV are kinematically allowed, those with higher mass have larger couplings. So the dominant decay would be into the heaviest possible fermion. However, the question is about kinematically allowed, not probable. Therefore, even very light fermions are allowed as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So as per the problem, we should list all possible fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. So even electrons are allowed, although in reality their coupling would be tiny.

But according to the problem statement, do we have any restrictions? The problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions" is given by that Lagrangian. So presumably, ψ_f is a fermion that X couples to. But if ψ_f refers to multiple fermions, each with their own coupling λ_f, then all the kinematically allowed ones are possible.

Alternatively, if in the model, there's a single fermion ψ_f which X couples to, in which case the answer would be X → ψ_f \barψ_f, provided 2m_f ≤6 GeV. But the notation ψ_f might mean for each fermion species f, like f = e, μ, τ, etc. So the subscript f likely indicates that for each fermion species, there's such an interaction term. Therefore, the decays would be possible for each f where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Therefore, depending on which fermions are included. If we assume standard model fermions, then:

Electron, muon, tau (masses below 3 GeV each), and the quarks up, down, strange, charm.

So the possible decays are:

- X → e+ e-
- X → μ+ μ-
- X → τ+ τ-
- X → c c̄ (charm quark-antiquark)
- X → s ś (strange quark-antiquark)
- X → u ū (up quark-antiquark)
- X → d đ (down quark-antiquark)

But in terms of detectable particles, the quark pairs will form hadronic jets, while the lepton pairs will be visible as leptons.

However, the problem is likely expecting the answer in terms of elementary particles, so listing the fermion pairs. Unless there are other decay modes possible. Wait, but in the given Lagrangian, the only interaction is between X and ψ_f. So, unless X has other interactions not mentioned here, the only possible decays at tree level are into these fermion-antifermion pairs. There might be higher-order decays, but the question specifies the lowest order, which is tree-level. So Feynman diagram would be X emitting a fermion and antifermion.

Therefore, the answer should list all possible fermion-antifermion pairs for which m_f ≤3 GeV. Therefore, if in Standard Model, tau (1.777 GeV) and below. So tau, charm, strange, up, down, electron, muon.

But also, note that the couplings for up and down quarks would be very small, so maybe they aren't considered? But again, the question is about kinematical allowance, not about coupling strength. So even if the coupling exists, kinematically allowed.

Hence, including all those. Therefore, listing all possible fermion pairs allowed by kinematics: lepton pairs (e, μ, τ) and quark pairs (u, d, s, c). Therefore, as elementary particles, those are the decays.

But the question says "What are the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order?" So possible answers:

X can decay into electron-positron pair, muon-antimuon pair, tau-antitau pair, charm-anticharm quark pair, strange-antistrange quark pair, up-antiup quark pair, and down-antidown quark pair.

But usually, in such particle physics contexts, when listing allowed decays, people specify the detectable particles. However, since quarks can't be observed freely, and form jets or mesons, perhaps we should specify hadronic decays. However, in terms of fundamental interactions, they decay into quark-antiquark pairs, which hadronize.

Alternatively, depending on the setup of the problem. The Lagrangian has color indices? If ψ_f includes colored particles (quarks), then X should be a color singlet. Given that the interaction term is written as \barψ_f (something) ψ_f, which for quarks would involve color indices summed, resulting in a color singlet.

So whether X is a color singlet? Since after all, X is a boson (scalar), and a color singlet to interact with quark-antiquark pairs.

Therefore, if X is a color singlet, then the decay into quark-antiquark pairs would result in color-singlet combinations, i.e., mesons. But that's more about the actual hadronization, but the fundamental decay is into quark-antiquark pairs.

Therefore, the answer should include all the fermions pairs where their masses allow it, regardless of being leptons or quarks.

Therefore, I think the answer requires listing all standard model fermion-antifermion pairs with mass ≤3 GeV, so:

- Electrons
- Muons
- Taus
- Charm quarks
- Strange quarks
- Up and Down quarks

Thus, these are all kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

**Final Answer**

The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order are \( X \to e^+ e^- \), \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( X \to c \bar{c} \), \( X \to s \bar{s} \), \( X \to u \bar{u} \), and \( X \to d \bar{d} \). Therefore, the allowed decays are:

\boxed{X \to e^+ e^-, \ \mu^+ \mu^-, \ \tau^+ \tau^-, \ c \bar{c}, \ s \bar{s}, \ u \bar{u}, \ d \bar{d}}

Alright, so I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson X and some fermion fields ψ_f. The term has a coupling constant λ_f and it's multiplied by (v + X), so when X is in the interaction, it's coupling to the fermions. The parameter v is probably the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of some field, maybe the Higgs? But maybe not necessarily. Maybe X is a scalar boson interacting with the fermions through a Yukawa coupling.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Kinematically allowed decays depend on the masses of the decay products. At the lowest order, so tree-level processes, the boson X can decay into pairs of particles if their combined mass is less than or equal to the mass of X.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is of the form X \bar{\psi}_f ψ_f, so the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. That suggests that the decay would be X → ψ_f + \bar{\ψ}_f, right? Because in terms of Feynman diagrams, the boson would split into a fermion-antifermion pair.

But wait, fermions are usually massive, so the mass of the fermion ψ_f must be such that 2m_f ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, the fermion's mass m_f has to be ≤ 3 GeV. Otherwise, the decay is not kinematically allowed.

So the question is, which standard model fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Since the problem doesn't specify otherwise, maybe we assume standard model fermions unless specified. Let me recall the masses of the fermions:

Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.511 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up quark: ~2.2 MeV
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV
- Strange quark: ~96 MeV
- Top quark: ~173 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.18 GeV

But quarks are confined, so the decays would be into hadrons. However, maybe in this model, ψ_f can be any fermion, including quarks? But since X is a boson with 6 GeV mass, if it's a scalar (which I might need to confirm), maybe similar to the Higgs. The Higgs can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the fermion mass is less than half the Higgs mass.

Wait, the Higgs is 125 GeV. So the top quark, with 173 GeV, can't be decayed into by the Higgs. But other fermions with masses below 62.5 GeV could be possible. But in our case, the X boson is 6 GeV. So the maximum mass of the fermion it can decay into would be 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses, only the tau lepton is 1.777 GeV, which is below 3 GeV. The charm quark is about 1.27 GeV, also below 3 GeV. However, the bottom quark is 4.18 GeV, so too heavy. The top quark is way too heavy. So quarks like charm, strange, down, up, etc., are all below 3 GeV. So X could decay into pairs of charm-anticharm, strange-antis strange, etc. If ψ_f includes all these fermions.

But wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to fermions proportional to their mass. However, the interaction here is written as -λ_f \bar{\ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. If v is a VEV, then when X is zero, the term becomes -λ_f v \bar{\ψ}_f ψ_f, meaning that the mass of the fermion is m_f = λ_f v. This is like the Yukawa interaction. So the mass of each fermion is determined by λ_f v. Then, depending on λ_f, the coupling is fixed.

But in this problem, the mass of X is 6 GeV. To determine poss

I need to determine the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian L(y) = -λ_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Let me analyze this systematically.

The Lagrangian shows an interaction between boson X and fermion fields ψ_f, with a coupling constant λ_f multiplied by (v + X). This suggests that X couples to the fermions. The parameter v likely represents a vacuum expectation value of some field, possibly the Higgs, and X might be a scalar boson interacting with fermions through a Yukawa coupling.

For kinematically allowed decays at tree-level, the boson X can decay into pairs of particles if their combined mass doesn't exceed the mass of X. The Lagrangian term X \bar{\psi}_f ψ_f indicates that X could decay into a fermion-antifermion pair (X → ψ_f + \bar{\ψ}_f). For this to be possible, the fermion mass m_f must satisfy 2m_f ≤ m_X. With m_X = 6 GeV, each fermion must have a mass ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at Standard Model fermions with masses below 3 GeV:

Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.511 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up quark: ~2.2 MeV
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV
- Strange quark: ~96 MeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.18 GeV (exceeds the limit)
- Top quark: ~173 GeV (exceeds the limit)

Although quarks are confined, in this model ψ_f might represent any fermion. Similar to the Higgs mechanism, X could decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if their masses permit it.

Examining the interaction term more closely: when X=0, we get -λ_f v \bar{\psi}_f ψ_f, suggesting the fermion mass is m_f = λ_f v. This resembles a Yukawa interaction, with each fermion's mass determined by λ_f v.

Given X's 6 GeV mass, it could potentially decay into tau lepton pairs, charm quark pairs, and lighter fermion pairs, as these all have masses below 3 GeV. The bottom quark at 4.18 GeV and top quark at 173 GeV would be kinematically forbidden decay products.

Okay, I need to determine the possible decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV, considering what is kinematically allowed. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I’ll break down the problem step by step.

The Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson X and certain fermion fields ψ_f, with a coupling constant λ_f. The term involves (v + X) being multiplied, which indicates the coupling of X to fermions. The parameter v is likely the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of some field—perhaps the Higgs field, though it isn't assured. Maybe X is a scalar boson interacting with fermions via a Yukawa coupling.

Given that boson X's mass is 6 GeV, its decays are limited by the masses of the possible decay products. At the tree level, X can decay into particle pairs as long as their combined mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Examining the Lagrangian, the interaction term is X \bar{\psi}_f ψ_f, implying that X interacts with fermion ψ_f, suggesting decays of the form X → ψ_f + \bar{ψ}_f, meaning the boson decays into a fermion-antifermion pair.

Since fermions are generally massive, the mass of fermion ψ_f must satisfy 2m_f ≤ m_X. With m_X at 6 GeV, then m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV to permit the decay kinematically.

The inquiry then becomes which standard model fermions have masses ≤ 3 GeV. Lacking other specifics, we assume standard model fermions. Let me recall their masses:

Leptons:
- Electron: ~0.511 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up quark: ~2.2 MeV
- Down quark: ~4.7 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.27 GeV
- Strange quark: ~96 MeV
- Top quark: ~173 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.18 GeV

With quarks being confined, decays would result in hadrons, but in this scenario, perhaps ψ_f includes quarks. X being a boson with 6 GeV mass suggests it could behave like a scalar such as the Higgs. The Higgs decays into fermion-antifermion pairs when those fermion masses are less than half its mass.

Remember, the Higgs mass is 125 GeV, not permitting decay into the top quark (173 GeV), but allowing those under 62.5 GeV. However, for X at 6 GeV, any decay fermion must be ≤ 3 GeV.

Considering the fermion masses, the tau lepton at 1.777 GeV fits, as does the charm quark near 1.27 GeV. The bottom quark, at 4.18 GeV, is too heavy, as is the top quark. Thus, quarks such as charm, strange, down, up, etc., are viable for X's decays were ψ_f includes them all.

However, in the Standard Model, Higgs-fermion coupling relates to their mass. Here, the interaction is -λ_f \bar{ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. Assuming v represents a VEV, when X is zero, it results in -λ_f v \bar{ψ}_f ψ_f, meaning the fermion mass is m_f = λ_f v, akin to a Yukawa interaction—each fermion's mass dictated by λ_f v. Therefore, X's decay possibilities align with m_X being 6 GeV, factoring in...

So for a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the boson\'s mass. However, actually, in decay kinematics, it\'s the total rest mass of the decay products. For a particle of mass M decaying into two particles of mass m1 and m2, the decay is allowed if M ≥ m1 + m2. But in the case of fermion-antifermion pair, they have the same mass m, so it\'s M ≥ 2m.\n\nTherefore, the boson X can decay into a fermion and its antiparticle if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Therefore, m_f ≤ 3 GeV.\n\nLooking back at the fermion masses:\n\nLeptons: Only tau is 1.777 GeV, so 2m_tau ≈ 3.55 GeV < 6 GeV. Wait, 3.55 is less than 6. So that is allowed. Wait, hang on, if m_X is 6 GeV, and 2m_tau is about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So decay into tau+ tau- is allowed?\n\nWait, wait, in particle physics, when calculating whether a decay is allowed, you just check if the parent mass is larger than the sum of the daughter masses. For example, if X → tau+ + tau-, the sum of the rest masses of tau+ and tau- is 2 * 1.777 GeV = 3.554 GeV. Since 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV, that decay is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if X → c + c̄ (charm quark and anti-charm), the sum of masses would be 2*1.27 GeV = 2.54 GeV < 6 GeV, so allowed.\n\nSame for lighter quarks. Also, since the interaction term is with the fermion fields in general, X could decay into any fermion that it couples to with 2m_f ≤ m_X. Given the problem doesn\'t specify anything else, we should consider all possible standard model fermions that satisfy 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.\n\nBut wait, up-type quarks: even though their masses are smaller, like up quark 2 MeV, their decay products would be allowed, but since quarks are confined, they would result in jets or mesons. Similarly with electrons and muons.\n\nBut the question is about the kinematically allowed decays. Whether the decay is observed or not is a different issue, but in terms of kinematics, as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X, it\'s allowed. So for the X boson of 6 GeV, which fermions can have 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV? Let me list them:\n\n- Electron: 2m_e ≈ 1.022 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed.\n- Muon: 2m_mu ≈ 211.4 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed.\n- Tau: 2m_tau ≈ 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed.\n- Up quark: 2m_up ≈ 4.4 MeV: allowed.\n- Down quark: ~9.4 MeV: allowed.\n- Strange quark: ~192 MeV: allowed.\n- Charm quark: ~2.54 GeV: allowed.\n- Bottom quark: 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV: not allowed.\n- Top quark: 346 GeV, way above, not allowed.\n\nTherefore, except for bottom and top, all other standard model fermions have 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV, so the kinematically allowed decays are into all these fermion-antifermion pairs: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄. But given that in the Lagrangian, the coupling is specified as λ_f for each fermion type, unless some λ_f are zero, all these channels are possible. But the problem statement doesn\'t mention any restrictions on the couplings. It just says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So I think we have to assume that λ_f is non-zero for all fermions, so that all kinematically allowed decays are possible.\n\nBut wait, the Lagrangian seems to involve a sum over f? Wait, the problem writes L(y) = -λ_f \\bar{\\psi}_f (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, the subscript f on λ and ψ_f suggests that there\'s a sum over f. So in other words, the interaction term is a sum over all fermion species f: for each fermion f, you have this term with its own coupling λ_f. So if all λ_f are non-zero, then in principle, the X boson can decay into any f \\bar{f} pair where 2m_f <= m_X. But if some λ_f are zero, those channels would be closed. However, the problem does not state anything about the couplings, so we have to assume all possible fermion species that are kinematically allowed, but in reality, in the standard model, couplings depend on the type of boson.\n\nWait a moment, but in the problem, the boson X is a scalar boson? Because the interaction is X \\barψψ, which is a Yukawa coupling. The Higgs boson, for example, has such interactions. So the X boson here would be a scalar, like the Higgs, coupling to fermions. Then in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to fermions proportional to their mass. So heavier fermions have larger couplings.\n\nBut in this problem, are we supposed to infer that the couplings λ_f are non-zero for all fermions? If so, then all allowed fermion-antifermion pairs with 2m_f <= 6 GeV are possible decay channels. Hence, tau+ tau-, c c̄, and all lighter quarks and leptons.\n\nHowever, perhaps we need to be careful. Quarks can\'t be observed as free particles; they hadronize. So decay into quark-antiquark pairs would result in jets or mesons, but kinematically, it\'s still an allowed decay. So even though the actual observed particles would be hadrons, the decay at the fundamental level is into quarks. So I think kinematically, those are allowed. The problem just asks for the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at lowest order, so quark-antiquark pairs are allowed, even though they then form jets.\n\nSimilarly, the tau lepton is heavy but can decay further, but the primary decay of X would be into tau+ tau-.\n\nBut maybe there\'s another angle here. Is there a possibility of the X boson decaying into gauge bosons? For instance, if the X is part of a larger symmetry, maybe it can decay into W+ W- or something else? But the given Lagrangian only shows the interaction with fermions. If there are no terms in the Lagrangian that couple X to gauge bosons, then such decays would not be possible at tree level. So, the problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by [this Lagrangian]". Therefore, other interactions (like with gauge bosons) are not mentioned, so maybe we can assume they are absent or negligible at the lowest order.\n\nIn that case, the only possible decays are into fermion-antifermion pairs. Thus, the allowed decays would be into:\n\n1. tau+ tau-\n2. charm quark and charm antiquark (c c̄)\n3. strange quark and strange antiquark (s s̄)\n4. mu+ mu-\n5. down quark and down antiquark (d d̄)\n6. up quark and up antiquark (u ū)\n7. electron+ electron-\n\nBut since the problem is asking for "kinematically allowed decays", all these should be allowed. However, the X boson\'s mass is 6 GeV. Let me check for each fermion:\n\n- Tau: 1.777 GeV, so 2*1.777 = 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed\n- Charm: 1.27 GeV, 2.54 < 6 GeV: allowed\n- Strange: 96 MeV, 192 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed\n- Up: 2.2 MeV, 4.4 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed\n- Down: 4.7 MeV, 9.4 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed\n- Muon: 105.7 MeV, 211.4 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed\n- Electron: 0.511 MeV, 1.022 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed\n\nSo all these are allowed. Therefore, all fermion-antifermion pairs except for top and bottom quarks are allowed. Since top is too heavy, bottom quark is 4.18 GeV: 2*4.18=8.36 GeV >6 GeV, so forbidden.\n\nSo if X boson can couple to all standard model fermions, then these are the allowed decays. Therefore, the answer would list all possible pairs for the allowed fermions. But maybe in the problem, the fermions are only a specific type. Wait, in the Lagrangian, it\'s written for a general f, ψ_f. So perhaps X couples to all fermion species. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to all massive fermions. If this is a similar case, then all these decays are allowed. Hence, the kinematically allowed decays would be into each fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion\'s mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.\n\nBut wait, it might be better to specify each possible fermion. The question mentions "What are the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order?" So the answer is likely that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where twice the fermion mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV, i.e., each of these pairs mentioned above. However, depending on the model\'s specifics. If the problem is part of the Standard Model extension or a different model, but since no other information is given, just the interaction term, assume that all these decays are allowed.\n\nBut considering the problem comes from particle physics, in some contexts, people might use "kinematically allowed" while considering the actual available phase space. For light fermions, even though they are allowed, the decay may be suppressed if the coupling is very small. But the problem doesn\'t mention anything about coupling strengths, so we can ignore that and just go by kinematics.\n\nTherefore, the kinematically allowed decays are:\n\n- X → e⁺ e⁻\n- X → μ⁺ μ⁻\n- X → τ⁺ τ⁻\n- X → u ū\n- X → d d̄\n- X → s s̄\n- X → c c̄\n\nBut bottom quark pair is excluded, as X is not heavy enough. However, maybe the problem assumes that only the fermions that have masses close to the electroweak scale? But that\'s not indicated. The problem simply states the X\'s mass and the interaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parameter υ is the electroweak VEV, around 246 GeV. Then the fermion masses would be m_f = λ_f υ. So since m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV, then λ_f needs to be m_f / υ ≈ 3 GeV / 246 GeV ≈ 0.012. So unless λ_f for the heavy fermions is large enough, some may not have m_f above their actual masses. Wait, but that line of thinking might complicate things. If m_f is given by λ_f υ, the question is whether m_f is as in the Standard Model. But the problem doesn\'t make this connection. It just states that the Lagrangian is -λ_f \\bar{ψ}_f (υ + X) ψ_f, and that m_X is 6 GeV. It could be that in this model, the Yukawa couplings λ_f are different, leading to the correct fermion masses. However, we are not given information about υ or the actual λ_f\'s. Therefore, perhaps we cannot infer whether the couplings are there or not. \n\nWait, but the problem is formulated such that the interaction is given and the question is purely about kinematic accessibility, regardless of coupling strength, which is lambda_f. Since the decay rate would depend on λ_f squared, but the question is about allowed decay channels, not their branching ratios. Therefore, we can assume that if the interaction term exists (i.e., lambda_f ≠ 0), then the decay is allowed as long as kinematics permit. Since the Lagrangian is given for fermions in general, and unless excluded, must consider all fermions. So as per the information given, regardless of the actual fermion masses in real life, but given that the question specifies the mass of X and asks for decays into fermions (the Lagrangian), perhaps the mass of fermions in this model are such that they can be light enough? Wait, but no, the fermion masses should themselves be related to the term λ_f υ. But perhaps we don\'t have to worry about that. The problem is perhaps a simplified model where X couples to fermions but X itself is given a mass, and the fermion masses are arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I\'m overcomplicating. Let\'s step back.\n\nIf it\'s given that the interaction is between X and the fermion fields, the conclusion is that the boson can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f <= m_X. Therefore, allowed channels are all pairs with m_f <= 3 GeV.\n\nIn the Standard Model, fermion masses below 3 GeV are most of them (except bottom and top). So, answer: X can decay into electron-positron, muon-antimuon, tau-antitau, and the quark-antiquark pairs of up, down, strange, and charm.\n\nBut note that quarks will hadronize, so the actual decay products would be hadrons for the quark cases, but at the parton level, it\'s the quark-antiquark pair. The problem just asks for kinematically allowed decays, which are the fundamental processes. So the answer is all these fermion pairs. Thus, the allowed decays are e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of standard particles. Since up and down quarks are constituent quarks of pions and other light mesons, maybe the hadronic decays would be into mesons. But for the purpose of the question, it\'s probably acceptable to list the fundamental fermions.\n\nAlternatively, someone might say that the baryons will have higher mass, but no, the quarks are produced then form jets or mesons, which have masses derived from quark masses and binding energy, but kinematically, the decay is at the quark level.\n\nTherefore, if the problem is part of a course or context where they consider parton-level decays, then the answer includes all quark-antiquark pairs (except bottom and top) and all lepton pairs (except tau if it\'s over the limit, but no, tau is allowed).\n\nConsidering all that, I think the correct answer is that the kinematically allowed decays are X → e⁺ e⁻, μ⁺ μ⁻, τ⁺ τ⁻, and quark-antiquark pairs uū, dd̄, ss̄, cc̄. Hence, in the answer, list those. However, the problem may expect one to list the quark pairs as hadrons, but since quarks cannot be directly observed and instead form jets or mesons, but again, since the question asks about kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order, which are elementary processes, the decay products are the fermions themselves. Therefore, the answer is to list all possible fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ m_X.\n\nAlternatively, there\'s another possible decay if the boson has other interactions. But the problem only specifies the interaction with fermions. If the X boson is a scalar, it cannot decay into vector bosons (like gluons, photons, W, Z) at tree level unless it has interactions with them. Since the Lagrangian given is only for fermions, such decays would not be allowed at the lowest order. Therefore, the only possible decays are into the fermions listed.\n\nTo double-check: if the X boson is a scalar (like the Higgs), then couplings to gauge bosons would typically arise through loops or if X is part of a Higgs multiplet. However, the given Lagrangian does not include such interactions, so those decays (e.g., X → γγ, X → gg, X → WW, X → ZZ) would not be possible at tree level.\n\nHence, the only kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order (tree level) are into the fermion-antifermion pairs listed earlier.\n\nSo in summary, the allowed decays are:\n\n- Electrons: e⁺ e⁻\n\n- Muons: μ⁺ μ⁻\n\n- Taus: τ⁺ τ⁻\n\n- Up quarks: u ū\n\n- Down quarks: d d̄\n\n- Strange quarks: s s̄\n\n- Charm quarks: c c̄\n\nBottom quarks are too heavy (their pair would be 8.36 GeV, exceeding the X\'s mass), so excluded.\n\nSo the final answer should list all these fermion pairs.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743846496, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4516, prompt_tokens=1037, total_tokens=5553, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order are determined by the interaction Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\), where \( X \) couples to fermions \(\psi_f \). For a decay \( X \to \psi_f \bar{\psi}_f \) to be allowed, the sum of the rest masses of the fermion-antifermion pair must not exceed the boson mass: \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are allowed.

**Allowed decay channels** (for \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \)):

1. **Leptons**:
   - \( X \to e^+ e^- \) (electron-positron pair, \( 2m_e \approx 1.02 \, \text{MeV} \))
   - \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \) (muon-antimuon pair, \( 2m_\mu \approx 211 \, \text{MeV} \))
   - \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \) (tau-antitau pair, \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.55 \, \text{GeV} \))

2. **Quarks**:
   - \( X \to u \bar{u} \) (up-antiquark pair, \( 2m_u \approx 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \))
   - \( X \to d \bar{d} \) (down-antiquark pair, \( 2m_d \approx 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \))
   - \( X \to s \bar{s} \) (strange-antistrange pair, \( 2m_s \approx 192 \, \text{MeV} \))
   - \( X \to c \bar{c} \) (charm-anticharm pair, \( 2m_c \approx 2.54 \, \text{GeV} \))

**Excluded decays**: 
- \( X \to b \bar{b} \) (bottom-antibottom pair, \( 2m_b \approx 8.36 \, \text{GeV} \)) and \( X \to t \bar{t} \) (top-antitop pair, \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \)) are kinematically forbidden.

**Conclusion**: At tree level, \( X \) decays into all Standard Model fermion-antifermion pairs listed above.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

ibles decays, perhaps we need to know which fermions have masses less than m_X / 2, which is 3 GeV.

If we consider all Standard Model fermions:

Leptons:
- Electron: 0.000511 GeV
- Muon: 0.1057 GeV
- Tau: 1.777 GeV
Quarks:
- Up: 0.0022 GeV
- Down: 0.0047 GeV
- Charm: 1.27 GeV
- Strange: 0.096 GeV
- Top: 173 GeV
- Bottom: 4.18 GeV

So from quarks, charm (1.27 GeV), strange (0.096), up (0.0022), and down (0.0047) are all below 3 GeV. But the bottom quark is 4.18 GeV, so too heavy. Then the tau lepton is 1.777 GeV, which is allowed, since 1.777 * 2 = 3.554 GeV, but wait no. Wait, wait, the boson mass is 6 GeV. Wait, the rest mass energy of the decay products must be less than or equal to the boson's mass. So for a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than the boson's mass. However, actually, in decay kinematics, it's the total rest mass of the decay products. For a particle of mass M decaying into two particles of mass m1 and m2, the decay is allowed if M ≥ m1 + m2. But in the case of fermion-antifermion pair, they have the same mass m, so it's M ≥ 2m.

Therefore, the boson X can decay into a fermion and its antiparticle if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Therefore, m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking back at the fermion masses:

Leptons: Only tau is 1.777 GeV, so 2m_tau ≈ 3.55 GeV < 6 GeV. Wait, 3.55 is less than 6. So that is allowed. Wait, hang on, if m_X is 6 GeV, and 2m_tau is about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So decay into tau+ tau- is allowed?

Wait, wait, in particle physics, when calculating whether a decay is allowed, you just check if the parent mass is larger than the sum of the daughter masses. For example, if X → tau+ + tau-, the sum of the rest masses of tau+ and tau- is 2 * 1.777 GeV = 3.554 GeV. Since 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV, that decay is allowed.

Similarly, if X → c + c̄ (charm quark and anti-charm), the sum of masses would be 2*1.27 GeV = 2.54 GeV < 6 GeV, so allowed.

Same for lighter quarks. Also, since the interaction term is with the fermion fields in general, X could decay into any fermion that it couples to with 2m_f ≤ m_X. Given the problem doesn't specify anything else, we should consider all possible standard model fermions that satisfy 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

But wait, up-type quarks: even though their masses are smaller, like up quark 2 MeV, their decay products would be allowed, but since quarks are confined, they would result in jets or mesons. Similarly with electrons and muons.

But the question is about the kinematically allowed decays. Whether the decay is observed or not is a different issue, but in terms of kinematics, as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X, it's allowed. So for the X boson of 6 GeV, which fermions can have 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV? Let me list them:

- Electron: 2m_e ≈ 1.022 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed.
- Muon: 2m_mu ≈ 211.4 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed.
- Tau: 2m_tau ≈ 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed.
- Up quark: 2m_up ≈ 4.4 MeV: allowed.
- Down quark: ~9.4 MeV: allowed.
- Strange quark: ~192 MeV: allowed.
- Charm quark: ~2.54 GeV: allowed.
- Bottom quark: 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV: not allowed.
- Top quark: 346 GeV, way above, not allowed.

Therefore, except for bottom and top, all other standard model fermions have 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV, so the kinematically allowed decays are into all these fermion-antifermion pairs: e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄. But given that in the Lagrangian, the coupling is specified as λ_f for each fermion type, unless some λ_f are zero, all these channels are possible. But the problem statement doesn't mention any restrictions on the couplings. It just says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So I think we have to assume that λ_f is non-zero for all fermions, so that all kinematically allowed decays are possible.

But wait, the Lagrangian seems to involve a sum over f? Wait, the problem writes L(y) = -λ_f \bar{\psi}_f (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, the subscript f on λ and ψ_f suggests that there's a sum over f. So in other words, the interaction term is a sum over all fermion species f: for each fermion f, you have this term with its own coupling λ_f. So if all λ_f are non-zero, then in principle, the X boson can decay into any f \bar{f} pair where 2m_f <= m_X. But if some λ_f are zero, those channels would be closed. However, the problem does not state anything about the couplings, so we have to assume all possible fermion species that are kinematically allowed, but in reality, in the standard model, couplings depend on the type of boson.

Wait a moment, but in the problem, the boson X is a scalar boson? Because the interaction is X \barψψ, which is a Yukawa coupling. The Higgs boson, for example, has such interactions. So the X boson here would be a scalar, like the Higgs, coupling to fermions. Then in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to fermions proportional to their mass. So heavier fermions have larger couplings.

But in this problem, are we supposed to infer that the couplings λ_f are non-zero for all fermions? If so, then all allowed fermion-antifermion pairs with 2m_f <= 6 GeV are possible decay channels. Hence, tau+ tau-, c c̄, and all lighter quarks and leptons.

However, perhaps we need to be careful. Quarks can't be observed as free particles; they hadronize. So decay into quark-antiquark pairs would result in jets or mesons, but kinematically, it's still an allowed decay. So even though the actual observed particles would be hadrons, the decay at the fundamental level is into quarks. So I think kinematically, those are allowed. The problem just asks for the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at lowest order, so quark-antiquark pairs are allowed, even though they then form jets.

Similarly, the tau lepton is heavy but can decay further, but the primary decay of X would be into tau+ tau-.

But maybe there's another angle here. Is there a possibility of the X boson decaying into gauge bosons? For instance, if the X is part of a larger symmetry, maybe it can decay into W+ W- or something else? But the given Lagrangian only shows the interaction with fermions. If there are no terms in the Lagrangian that couple X to gauge bosons, then such decays would not be possible at tree level. So, the problem statement says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by [this Lagrangian]". Therefore, other interactions (like with gauge bosons) are not mentioned, so maybe we can assume they are absent or negligible at the lowest order.

In that case, the only possible decays are into fermion-antifermion pairs. Thus, the allowed decays would be into:

1. tau+ tau-
2. charm quark and charm antiquark (c c̄)
3. strange quark and strange antiquark (s s̄)
4. mu+ mu-
5. down quark and down antiquark (d d̄)
6. up quark and up antiquark (u ū)
7. electron+ electron-

But since the problem is asking for "kinematically allowed decays", all these should be allowed. However, the X boson's mass is 6 GeV. Let me check for each fermion:

- Tau: 1.777 GeV, so 2*1.777 = 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed
- Charm: 1.27 GeV, 2.54 < 6 GeV: allowed
- Strange: 96 MeV, 192 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed
- Up: 2.2 MeV, 4.4 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed
- Down: 4.7 MeV, 9.4 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed
- Muon: 105.7 MeV, 211.4 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed
- Electron: 0.511 MeV, 1.022 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed

So all these are allowed. Therefore, all fermion-antifermion pairs except for top and bottom quarks are allowed. Since top is too heavy, bottom quark is 4.18 GeV: 2*4.18=8.36 GeV >6 GeV, so forbidden.

So if X boson can couple to all standard model fermions, then these are the allowed decays. Therefore, the answer would list all possible pairs for the allowed fermions. But maybe in the problem, the fermions are only a specific type. Wait, in the Lagrangian, it's written for a general f, ψ_f. So perhaps X couples to all fermion species. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to all massive fermions. If this is a similar case, then all these decays are allowed. Hence, the kinematically allowed decays would be into each fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion's mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

But wait, it might be better to specify each possible fermion. The question mentions "What are the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order?" So the answer is likely that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where twice the fermion mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV, i.e., each of these pairs mentioned above. However, depending on the model's specifics. If the problem is part of the Standard Model extension or a different model, but since no other information is given, just the interaction term, assume that all these decays are allowed.

But considering the problem comes from particle physics, in some contexts, people might use "kinematically allowed" while considering the actual available phase space. For light fermions, even though they are allowed, the decay may be suppressed if the coupling is very small. But the problem doesn't mention anything about coupling strengths, so we can ignore that and just go by kinematics.

Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays are:

- X → e⁺ e⁻
- X → μ⁺ μ⁻
- X → τ⁺ τ⁻
- X → u ū
- X → d d̄
- X → s s̄
- X → c c̄

But bottom quark pair is excluded, as X is not heavy enough. However, maybe the problem assumes that only the fermions that have masses close to the electroweak scale? But that's not indicated. The problem simply states the X's mass and the interaction.

Alternatively, maybe the parameter υ is the electroweak VEV, around 246 GeV. Then the fermion masses would be m_f = λ_f υ. So since m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV, then λ_f needs to be m_f / υ ≈ 3 GeV / 246 GeV ≈ 0.012. So unless λ_f for the heavy fermions is large enough, some may not have m_f above their actual masses. Wait, but that line of thinking might complicate things. If m_f is given by λ_f υ, the question is whether m_f is as in the Standard Model. But the problem doesn't make this connection. It just states that the Lagrangian is -λ_f \bar{ψ}_f (υ + X) ψ_f, and that m_X is 6 GeV. It could be that in this model, the Yukawa couplings λ_f are different, leading to the correct fermion masses. However, we are not given information about υ or the actual λ_f's. Therefore, perhaps we cannot infer whether the couplings are there or not. 

Wait, but the problem is formulated such that the interaction is given and the question is purely about kinematic accessibility, regardless of coupling strength, which is lambda_f. Since the decay rate would depend on λ_f squared, but the question is about allowed decay channels, not their branching ratios. Therefore, we can assume that if the interaction term exists (i.e., lambda_f ≠ 0), then the decay is allowed as long as kinematics permit. Since the Lagrangian is given for fermions in general, and unless excluded, must consider all fermions. So as per the information given, regardless of the actual fermion masses in real life, but given that the question specifies the mass of X and asks for decays into fermions (the Lagrangian), perhaps the mass of fermions in this model are such that they can be light enough? Wait, but no, the fermion masses should themselves be related to the term λ_f υ. But perhaps we don't have to worry about that. The problem is perhaps a simplified model where X couples to fermions but X itself is given a mass, and the fermion masses are arbitrary.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's step back.

If it's given that the interaction is between X and the fermion fields, the conclusion is that the boson can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f <= m_X. Therefore, allowed channels are all pairs with m_f <= 3 GeV.

In the Standard Model, fermion masses below 3 GeV are most of them (except bottom and top). So, answer: X can decay into electron-positron, muon-antimuon, tau-antitau, and the quark-antiquark pairs of up, down, strange, and charm.

But note that quarks will hadronize, so the actual decay products would be hadrons for the quark cases, but at the parton level, it's the quark-antiquark pair. The problem just asks for kinematically allowed decays, which are the fundamental processes. So the answer is all these fermion pairs. Thus, the allowed decays are e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄. However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of standard particles. Since up and down quarks are constituent quarks of pions and other light mesons, maybe the hadronic decays would be into mesons. But for the purpose of the question, it's probably acceptable to list the fundamental fermions.

Alternatively, someone might say that the baryons will have higher mass, but no, the quarks are produced then form jets or mesons, which have masses derived from quark masses and binding energy, but kinematically, the decay is at the quark level.

Therefore, if the problem is part of a course or context where they consider parton-level decays, then the answer includes all quark-antiquark pairs (except bottom and top) and all lepton pairs (except tau if it's over the limit, but no, tau is allowed).

Considering all that, I think the correct answer is that the kinematically allowed decays are X → e⁺ e⁻, μ⁺ μ⁻, τ⁺ τ⁻, and quark-antiquark pairs uū, dd̄, ss̄, cc̄. Hence, in the answer, list those. However, the problem may expect one to list the quark pairs as hadrons, but since quarks cannot be directly observed and instead form jets or mesons, but again, since the question asks about kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order, which are elementary processes, the decay products are the fermions themselves. Therefore, the answer is to list all possible fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Alternatively, there's another possible decay if the boson has other interactions. But the problem only specifies the interaction with fermions. If the X boson is a scalar, it cannot decay into vector bosons (like gluons, photons, W, Z) at tree level unless it has interactions with them. Since the Lagrangian given is only for fermions, such decays would not be allowed at the lowest order. Therefore, the only possible decays are into the fermions listed.

To double-check: if the X boson is a scalar (like the Higgs), then couplings to gauge bosons would typically arise through loops or if X is part of a Higgs multiplet. However, the given Lagrangian does not include such interactions, so those decays (e.g., X → γγ, X → gg, X → WW, X → ZZ) would not be possible at tree level.

Hence, the only kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order (tree level) are into the fermion-antifermion pairs listed earlier.

So in summary, the allowed decays are:

- Electrons: e⁺ e⁻

- Muons: μ⁺ μ⁻

- Taus: τ⁺ τ⁻

- Up quarks: u ū

- Down quarks: d d̄

- Strange quarks: s s̄

- Charm quarks: c c̄

Bottom quarks are too heavy (their pair would be 8.36 GeV, exceeding the X's mass), so excluded.

So the final answer should list all these fermion pairs.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), at lowest order (tree level), are into **fermion-antifermion pairs** where the fermion mass satisfies \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). Explicitly:

\[
X \to \psi_f + \bar{\psi}_f \quad \text{if} \quad 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \implies m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

**Allowed decay channels (Standard Model fermions):**

1. **Leptons:**
   - \( X \to \tau^+ + \tau^- \) \quad (\( m_\tau = 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \))
   - \( X \to \mu^+ + \mu^- \) \quad (\( m_\mu = 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \))
   - \( X \to e^+ + e^- \) \quad (\( m_e = 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \))

2. **Quarks (though confined in hadrons):**
   - \( X \to c + \bar{c} \) \quad (\( m_c = 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \))
   - \( X \to s + \bar{s}, \, d + \bar{d}, \, u + \bar{u} \) \quad (lighter quarks, negligible mass)

**Forbidden decays (kinematically blocked):**
- \( X \nrightarrow b + \bar{b} \) \quad (requires \( 2m_b = 8.36 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))
- \( X \nrightarrow t + \bar{t} \) \quad (top quark \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \))

**Reasoning:**  
The interaction Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y)(v + X(y))\psi_f(y)\) implies a Yukawa coupling between \( X \) and the fermion \( \psi_f \). The mass term for the fermion arises as \( m_f = \lambda_f v \). For the decay \( X \to \psi_f \bar{\psi}_f \), energy conservation demands that the sum of the fermion masses in the final state cannot exceed the mass of \( X \). Since \( X \) is a scalar boson (assumed), its leading-order decays are into pairs of Standard Model fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

 However, since bottom quark pairs would require 8.36 GeV (sum 2*4.18 GeV), this is over the X mass of 6 GeV. Hence, bottom quarks are excluded.

Additionally, consider possible decays into other bosons. However, the given Lagrangian doesn't include interactions between X and other bosons. Therefore, the only kinematically allowed interactions at tree-level are to fermions whose individual masses sum to less than 6 GeV. Each decay mode must consist of two fermions (from ψ_f and \bar{\ψ}_f). Identifying which of the SM fermions have m_f such that 2m_f < 6 GeV:

- Tau: 2*1.777 GeV ≈ 3.55 GeV < 6 GeV → allowed
- Charm: 2*1.27 GeV ≈ 2.54 GeV < 6 GeV → allowed
- Strange: 2*0.096 GeV ≈ 0.192 GeV < 6 GeV → allowed
- Up/Down: masses negligible, allowed
- Electron, muon allowed as before.

But wait: Bottom quarks are 4.18 GeV each, so 2*4.18 = 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV → not allowed. Similarly, top is heavier. Therefore, all fermions with masses ≤3 GeV would be allowed. Since this includes tau, charm, etc., each combination where the sum is less than 6 GeV.

Depending on the model, if X couples to a specific set of fermions. However, the notation ψ_f suggests a generic fermion f, so unless we know which f\'s interactions are present, maybe through the coupling λ_f. If λ_f\'s are non-zero for certain fermions. Given that the problem states the Lagrangian in terms of ψ_f(y), with f index, presumably f ranges across different fermion species.\n\nAssuming X is a neutral boson (which makes sense given (v + X) symmetry?), so decay into charged fermion pairs would require charge conservation.\n\nThus, for X being neutral, f must be a charged particle to get opposite charges for the produced fermion and anti-fermion.\n\nLet\'s list all standard model charged fermions with mass m ≤3 GeV:\n\nLeptons:\n\n1. Electron: negligible mass. So decay into electrons.\nBut the coupling in the Yukawa term is proportional to the mass (if m_f = λ_f v), so perhaps even though the electron is light, if λ_e is non-zero but small.\n\nBut the problem is about kinematically allowed decays. So if X\'s mass is 6 GeV, any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV is allowed, regardless of coupling. Yet here, physically, the decay would proceed if there\'s a non-zero coupling; but the question asks which decays are kinematically allowed, irrespective of coupling strength.\n\nBut the interaction Lagrangian includes the term -(lambda_f) *(v + X) \\bar{\\psi}_f ψ_f. So, the bare coupling is there (Yukawa interaction), so if lambda_f is non-zero, X can decay into f + f-bar.\n\nSo if X is such that lambda_f ≠0 for some fermion f, then decay X→f+ f-bar is allowed if 2m_f ≤ m_X.\n\nAssuming that all fermions f for which lambda_f ≠0 (i.e., interact with X) and 2m_f <=6 GeV.\n\nSo if the model includes fermions like bottom quarks, tau leptons, charm quarks, etc., as long as their masses are less than 3 GeV. From standard masses:\n\n- Tau: m = ~1.777 GeV, so 2m ≈ 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Similarly, charm quark: m ≈ 1.27 GeV; 2m ≈ 2.54 GeV. Bottom quark is ~4.18 GeV, so 2m=8.36 GeV, which is heavier than 6 GeV. Hence, if X interacts with bottom quarks, the decay is forbidden. If X interacts with lighter quarks.\n\nBut we might need to check if the fermions which are less than 3 GeV. Tau and charm. Up, down, strange, charm, muon, electron. Also top is too heavy. But in reality: to get X→ fermion + antifermion, as X has to couple to them. Assuming X couples to up-type quarks, but the mass of the fermion must be ≤3 GeV.\n\nHowever, in the standard model, Higgs couples proportionally to the mass. Thus, higher mass fermions have higher couplings. But in this theoretical model, potentially unknown.\n\nGiven that X is mass 6 GeV, how would possible decays be? Let\'s suppose similar to a Higgs-like particle. In general, lower mass would prefer decays to smaller particles.\n\nBut kinematically allowed is only dependent on mass.\n\nSo H→ e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, c c-bar, and s s-bar, etc. But m_top is larger, others lighter.\n\nLet\'s list all fermions (charge particles, since neutral might not have charged consorts):\n\nCharged fermion masses (assuming X is neutral, per interaction being similar to Yukawa);\n\nElectron: 0.000511 GeV (nearly negligible)\nMuon: 0.1057 GeV\nTau: 1.777 GeV\n\nQuarks:\n\nUp: ~0.0022 GeV\nDown: ~0.0047 GeV\nStrange: ~0.096 GeV\nCharm: ~1.27 GeV\nBottom: ~4.18 GeV\nTop: ~173 GeV\n\nThe neutrinos are neutral but their masses are so small (like sub-eV to a few eV, so irrelevant for decay kin. analysis). For color-charged quarks (like c, s), decay products would form hadrons, but for the purpose of kinematic analysis, even quark-antiquark pairs would count as allowed if m_q*2 <= m_X.\n\nSo in this 6 GeV boson, the possible decays into fermion-antifermion pairs where 2mf <=6 GeV.\n\nTherefore:\n\nX → e+ e-\n\nX → μ+ μ-\n\nX → τ+ τ- (2 * 1.777 = 3.554 GeV ≤6 GeV)\n\nX → c c̄ (2*1.27=2.54 GeV ≤6)\n\nX → u ū (0.0044 GeV...), likely possible but negligible in branching ratio due to tiny coupling? But since we only ask for kinem allowed, couples only. Similarly, down, strange, etc.\n\nBut in the problem we need to pay attention if the model interaction includes ψ_f. Suppose f labels different fermions. If in the model, the X couples to all SM fermions (like a Higgs boson), then particles up to c and τ (since X is 6 GeV, so only these would have 2m <=6 GeV). Wait, bottom: 4.18x2=8.36 GeV>6, which is more. So indicated that all f with 2m_f <6 GeV => possible decay.\n\nBut does the interaction term of X require the fermion to get a mass from X via the term λ_f v*ψ_f ψ_f?\n\nIf so, that would mean that when X is set to zero, the fermions have mass m_f = λ_f v, much like the Higgs in the SM. In that case, if X couples to ψ_f, then these fermions have a mass. But the coupling could in principle be zero for some fermions which don’t get masses through this interaction.\n\nBut if the problem states that this is the interaction for X with fermions, leaving λ_f being non-zero for some or all fermions.\n\nBut given that the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions" is given by that Lagrangian. So possibly, X could couple to one or more fermion species. Without more info assuming all λ_f are non-zero, hence, all fermions with 2m_f <=6 GeV are allowed.\n\nBut strictly kinematically, regardless of whether they can actually happen (but the question is kinematically allowed, not dynamically allowed, i.e., whether energy is sufficient, regardless of coupling) but in actuality, if there is a coupling term, which under the problem\'s premise, since Lagrangian is given, then X must have to decay into any f where m_f <=3 GeV. But how to proceed here? The question asks: what are the KINEMATICALLY allowed decays?\n\nSo kinematic allowance only depends on whether the produced particles are less than or equal to the X\'s mass. So if m_X =6 GeV, then in two-body decay: for particles of mass m1 and m2,\n\nm1 + m2 <= m_X.\n\nSince mass of X is 6 GeV, then the decay to fermion anti-fermion pairs (with f charged, since they come from ψ_f and ψ_bar_f), therefore m_fermion = m_antifermion, so 2 m_f <=6 GeV.\n\nHence, list all fermion species with m_f <=3 GeV.\n\nFrom the standard model:\n\nCharged leptons:\n\n- electron: <<3\n- muon: <<3\n- tau: 1.777 <3\n\nQuarks:\n\n- up: negligible\n- down: negligible\n- strange: 0.096 GeV\n- charm:1.27\n- bottom:4.18>3 (so pairs exceed m_X=6 GeV)\n- top: way too heavy.\n\nSo the allowed pairs are:\n\ntau+ tau-, charm c-bar (moving over light quarks would also be allowed, but perhaps more of a role. Since quarks are confined and would materialize as jets, perhaps corresponding to c c-bar pairs (forming D mesons) or light quark pairs (like s s-bar or u/d), but according to the fermion assignment in the Lagrangian.\n\nAssuming that "psi_f" are the same as the standard model fermions.\n\nHence, kinematically allowed decays are to all fermion pairs where m_f <=3 GeV. Hence X could decay to:\n\n- e+ e-\n- mu+ mu-\n- tau+ tau-\n  if vector boson, but perhaps to-like decay. But the given Lagrangian suggests a scalar coupling (similar to Higgs), Higgs would be spin 0, so scalar.\n\nIf X is a scalar, decays are into fermion-antifermion pairs regardless. So for charged leptons, the three mentioned, and for quarks that aren\'t too heavy. The charm quark is allowed.\n\nHence, the kinematically allowed decays are two-body decays into each the charged leptons (e, mu, tau) pairs and quarks (u, d, s, c), and charge-conjugated antiparticles. But quark pairs are u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄. Then also the bottom quarks are too heavy (4.18 GeV) because two times their mass would exceed X\'s.\n\nBut since in QCD, creating heavy quark pairs would require more energy. Also, quarks like charm need to consider that their pair production\'s threshold is 2.54 GeV (since m_c ~1.27 GeV). As overall m_X is 6 GeV, 2.54 <6 GeV, so that\'s allowed.\n\nSo the possible kinematically allowed decays are X → e⁺ e⁻, μ⁺ μ⁻, τ⁺ τ⁻, c c̄, and pairs of lighter quarks (u ū, d d̄, s s̄).\n\nHypothetically, if neutrinos are Dirac fermions and have some mass, m_nu << GeV, assuming even up to a few GeV, but in reality, they\'re much lighter. If neutrinos are considered as possible decay products (assuming neutrino and antineutrino?), but since in the Lagrangian it\'s written asψ_f which could include neutrinos, though typically neutrinos are neutral but in standard model, the right-handed neutrinos might not be present unless it\'s a Dirac particle.\n\nHowever, if the neutrinos are Majorana, they\'re their own antiparticles, but in this interaction term, without more knowledge, it\'s unclear. Also, neutrinos have negligible mass (< eV), so 2m_nu<< GeV, so even kinematically allowed but perhaps not physically because of charge neutrality.\n\nHowever assuming that particle and antiparticle have opposite charges, then decaying into neutrinos would imply X is charged (if neutrino/anti are different) but X here is likely a neutral scalar, so can decay into neutral pairs. But in the lagrangian term, the interaction uses coupling between X and fermion pairs (ψ_f) and (bar), so same as Yukawa coupling.\n\nFor example, in the Standard Model, you have h \\bar{\\psi}\\psi, which for neutrinos (if Dirac) would exist. If interactions for neutrinos exist in this model, then X → ν ν̄ would be possible. However, since ν\'s are neutral, requires that such a term is allowed with X coupling to neutrinos, which they are neutral.\n\nBut neutrinos\' masses are so tiny that coupling could be smaller, but in terms of kinematics, as mass is negligible, the decay is possible but the momentum carried by the ν would be ~3 GeV each. However, but even here, standard model particles. But the problem might be considering charged fermion pairs.\n\nAlternatively, given that in the SM, Higgs does not couple to neutrinos (in the minimal SM without right-handed neutrinos), but here, if the Lagrangian for X allows ψ_f to include neutrinos, which depends on model specifics. Since problem doesn\'t specify whether neutrinos are included, but increasing prudence in determination.\n\nBut unless told otherwise, perhaps considered X decays to charged fermions, but let\'s check.\n\nSo possibilities are:\n\n-Charged leptons: e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ−\n-Quarks: u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄\n\nNow, bottom quarks would require X mass at least 8.36 GeV which is greater than 6 GeV so t/F.\n\nBut same with top quarks (massive), so negligible. \n\nHence, the kinematically allowed decays (at lowest order, ie tree level) are X decaying into respective charged lepton pairs and quark pairs for the lighter quarks and above.\n\nBut quarks get confined, so actual decays would result in jets, but abstractly like quark-antiquark.\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the decays kinematically allowed, i.e., which particles can it decay into regardless of the detection signature.\n\nHence, the answer would be:\n\nX can decay into any charged lepton-antilepton pair (e+ e-, μ+mu−, τ+ τ−) and quark-antiquark pairs where the quark is u, d, s, or c. The decay into bottom-antibottom pairs would require X mass greater than twice the bottom mass, which is 4.18 GeV*2 =8.36 GeV >6 GeV, so forbidden. Similarly, tops are heavier.\n\nThus the allowed decays at tree level (lowest order) are X→ e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, and quark pairs uū, dd̄, ss̄, cc̄. Therefore, write all these as kinematically allowed.\n\nBut how to best present this? Because including all the quark flavors...\n\nAlternatively, use groups. Since the up-type quarks (u, c) and down-type (d, s, b). Given that m_c=1.27, allowable but...\n\nActually, for up quark it\'s pair ū. So data:\n\nUp quark: negligible (so freely allowed)\n\nCharm quark: allowed; pair is c c̄\n\nAll other quarks (d, s) masses under 3 GeV (combined pairs would be 2*mass. Even in pair s s̄, would be 0.192 GeV in combined mass.\n\nTotal rate whereas takeaway: m_X has 6 GeV, which is more than sufficient, regardless of the fermion\'s own mass. Hence, since they are all under 3 GeV (tau at 1.777 gives 3.554 GeV total), All are allowed.\n\nSo the answer is that all possible fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermions has mass ≤3 GeV would be kinematically allowed. Thus, considering Standard Model charged leptons and the first four quarks (u, d, s, c), and their antiparticles. So the decay channels are:\n\n- Charged leptons: e+e−, μ+μ−, τ+τ−\n\n- Quarks: uū, dd̄, ss̄, cc̄\n\nTherefore, that\'s the answer.\n\nBut as quarks are confined, the actual decay would result in hadrons but that\'s beyond the kinematic consideration.\n\nHence, the kinematically allowed decays are all these fermion pairs.\n\nAlternatively, if the interaction term involves only specific fermions (although problem does not say that) but given the problem states "interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions" as given by the quoted Lagrangian. Hence, that particular Lagrangian might suggest coupling to all fermions ψ_f where λ_f is non-zero, but we aren\'t told which f\'s are present; so need to assume all possible.

The interaction between the bosonic field \( X \) and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y)
\]

The mass of the boson \( X \) is 6 GeV. To determine the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order, we need to consider the possible fermion-antifermion pairs that can be produced such that their combined mass does not exceed the mass of \( X \).

Key steps:
1. The decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is kinematically allowed if \( 2m_f \leq m_X \).
2. The mass of the boson \( X \) is 6 GeV, so \( 2m_f \leq 6 \) GeV implies \( m_f \leq 3 \) GeV.
3. Considering the Standard Model fermions, the charged leptons (electron, muon, tau) and quarks (up, down, strange, charm) have masses below 3 GeV.

Relevant fermion masses:
- Electron: \( 0.511 \) MeV
- Muon: \( 105.7 \) MeV
- Tau: \( 1.777 \) GeV
- Up quark: \( 2.2 \) MeV
- Down quark: \( 4.7 \) MeV
- Strange quark: \( 96 \) MeV
- Charm quark: \( 1.27 \) GeV

The bottom quark (\( 4.18 \) GeV) and top quark (\( 173 \) GeV) are too heavy for their masses to satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \) GeV.

Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order are into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
- Electron-positron pair (\( e^+ e^- \))
- Muon-antimuon pair (\( \mu^+ \mu^- \))
- Tau-antitau pair (\( \tau^+ \tau^- \))
- Charm-anticharm quark pair (\( c \bar{c} \))

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{X \to e^+ e^-}, \quad \boxed{X \to \mu^+ \mu^-}, \quad \boxed{X \to \tau^+ \tau^-}, \quad \boxed{X \to c \bar{c}}
\]

 Also, if the model allows for X decaying into all fermions that have their m_f less than 3 GeV, then which fermions they are.

But maybe there's an angle here. Depending on the model, if X couples to a specific set of fermions. However, the notation ψ_f suggests a generic fermion f, so unless we know which f's interactions are present, maybe through the coupling λ_f. If λ_f's are non-zero for certain fermions. Given that the problem states the Lagrangian in terms of ψ_f(y), with f index, presumably f ranges across different fermion species.

Assuming X is a neutral boson (which makes sense given (v + X) symmetry?), so decay into charged fermion pairs would require charge conservation.

Thus, for X being neutral, f must be a charged particle to get opposite charges for the produced fermion and anti-fermion.

Let's list all standard model charged fermions with mass m ≤3 GeV:

Leptons:

1. Electron: negligible mass. So decay into electrons.
But the coupling in the Yukawa term is proportional to the mass (if m_f = λ_f v), so perhaps even though the electron is light, if λ_e is non-zero but small.

But the problem is about kinematically allowed decays. So if X's mass is 6 GeV, any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV is allowed, regardless of coupling. Yet here, physically, the decay would proceed if there's a non-zero coupling; but the question asks which decays are kinematically allowed, irrespective of coupling strength.

But the interaction Lagrangian includes the term -(lambda_f) *(v + X) \bar{\psi}_f ψ_f. So, the bare coupling is there (Yukawa interaction), so if lambda_f is non-zero, X can decay into f + f-bar.

So if X is such that lambda_f ≠0 for some fermion f, then decay X→f+ f-bar is allowed if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Assuming that all fermions f for which lambda_f ≠0 (i.e., interact with X) and 2m_f <=6 GeV.

So if the model includes fermions like bottom quarks, tau leptons, charm quarks, etc., as long as their masses are less than 3 GeV. From standard masses:

- Tau: m = ~1.777 GeV, so 2m ≈ 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Similarly, charm quark: m ≈ 1.27 GeV; 2m ≈ 2.54 GeV. Bottom quark is ~4.18 GeV, so 2m=8.36 GeV, which is heavier than 6 GeV. Hence, if X interacts with bottom quarks, the decay is forbidden. If X interacts with lighter quarks.

But we might need to check if the fermions which are less than 3 GeV. Tau and charm. Up, down, strange, charm, muon, electron. Also top is too heavy. But in reality: to get X→ fermion + antifermion, as X has to couple to them. Assuming X couples to up-type quarks, but the mass of the fermion must be ≤3 GeV.

However, in the standard model, Higgs couples proportionally to the mass. Thus, higher mass fermions have higher couplings. But in this theoretical model, potentially unknown.

Given that X is mass 6 GeV, how would possible decays be? Let's suppose similar to a Higgs-like particle. In general, lower mass would prefer decays to smaller particles.

But kinematically allowed is only dependent on mass.

So H→ e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, c c-bar, and s s-bar, etc. But m_top is larger, others lighter.

Let's list all fermions (charge particles, since neutral might not have charged consorts):

Charged fermion masses (assuming X is neutral, per interaction being similar to Yukawa);

Electron: 0.000511 GeV (nearly negligible)
Muon: 0.1057 GeV
Tau: 1.777 GeV

Quarks:

Up: ~0.0022 GeV
Down: ~0.0047 GeV
Strange: ~0.096 GeV
Charm: ~1.27 GeV
Bottom: ~4.18 GeV
Top: ~173 GeV

The neutrinos are neutral but their masses are so small (like sub-eV to a few eV, so irrelevant for decay kin. analysis). For color-charged quarks (like c, s), decay products would form hadrons, but for the purpose of kinematic analysis, even quark-antiquark pairs would count as allowed if m_q*2 <= m_X.

So in this 6 GeV boson, the possible decays into fermion-antifermion pairs where 2mf <=6 GeV.

Therefore:

X → e+ e-

X → μ+ μ-

X → τ+ τ- (2 * 1.777 = 3.554 GeV ≤6 GeV)

X → c c̄ (2*1.27=2.54 GeV ≤6)

X → u ū (0.0044 GeV...), likely possible but negligible in branching ratio due to tiny coupling? But since we only ask for kinem allowed, couples only. Similarly, down, strange, etc.

But in the problem we need to pay attention if the model interaction includes ψ_f. Suppose f labels different fermions. If in the model, the X couples to all SM fermions (like a Higgs boson), then particles up to c and τ (since X is 6 GeV, so only these would have 2m <=6 GeV). Wait, bottom: 4.18x2=8.36 GeV>6, which is more. So indicated that all f with 2m_f <6 GeV => possible decay.

But does the interaction term of X require the fermion to get a mass from X via the term λ_f v*ψ_f ψ_f?

If so, that would mean that when X is set to zero, the fermions have mass m_f = λ_f v, much like the Higgs in the SM. In that case, if X couples to ψ_f, then these fermions have a mass. But the coupling could in principle be zero for some fermions which don’t get masses through this interaction.

But if the problem states that this is the interaction for X with fermions, leaving λ_f being non-zero for some or all fermions.

But given that the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions" is given by that Lagrangian. So possibly, X could couple to one or more fermion species. Without more info assuming all λ_f are non-zero, hence, all fermions with 2m_f <=6 GeV are allowed.

But strictly kinematically, regardless of whether they can actually happen (but the question is kinematically allowed, not dynamically allowed, i.e., whether energy is sufficient, regardless of coupling) but in actuality, if there is a coupling term, which under the problem's premise, since Lagrangian is given, then X must have to decay into any f where m_f <=3 GeV. But how to proceed here? The question asks: what are the KINEMATICALLY allowed decays?

So kinematic allowance only depends on whether the produced particles are less than or equal to the X's mass. So if m_X =6 GeV, then in two-body decay: for particles of mass m1 and m2,

m1 + m2 <= m_X.

Since mass of X is 6 GeV, then the decay to fermion anti-fermion pairs (with f charged, since they come from ψ_f and ψ_bar_f), therefore m_fermion = m_antifermion, so 2 m_f <=6 GeV.

Hence, list all fermion species with m_f <=3 GeV.

From the standard model:

Charged leptons:

- electron: <<3
- muon: <<3
- tau: 1.777 <3

Quarks:

- up: negligible
- down: negligible
- strange: 0.096 GeV
- charm:1.27
- bottom:4.18>3 (so pairs exceed m_X=6 GeV)
- top: way too heavy.

So the allowed pairs are:

tau+ tau-, charm c-bar (moving over light quarks would also be allowed, but perhaps more of a role. Since quarks are confined and would materialize as jets, perhaps corresponding to c c-bar pairs (forming D mesons) or light quark pairs (like s s-bar or u/d), but according to the fermion assignment in the Lagrangian.

Assuming that "psi_f" are the same as the standard model fermions.

Hence, kinematically allowed decays are to all fermion pairs where m_f <=3 GeV. Hence X could decay to:

- e+ e-
- mu+ mu-
- tau+ tau-
  if vector boson, but perhaps to-like decay. But the given Lagrangian suggests a scalar coupling (similar to Higgs), Higgs would be spin 0, so scalar.

If X is a scalar, decays are into fermion-antifermion pairs regardless. So for charged leptons, the three mentioned, and for quarks that aren't too heavy. The charm quark is allowed.

Hence, the kinematically allowed decays are two-body decays into each the charged leptons (e, mu, tau) pairs and quarks (u, d, s, c), and charge-conjugated antiparticles. But quark pairs are u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄. Then also the bottom quarks are too heavy (4.18 GeV) because two times their mass would exceed X's.

But since in QCD, creating heavy quark pairs would require more energy. Also, quarks like charm need to consider that their pair production's threshold is 2.54 GeV (since m_c ~1.27 GeV). As overall m_X is 6 GeV, 2.54 <6 GeV, so that's allowed.

So the possible kinematically allowed decays are X → e⁺ e⁻, μ⁺ μ⁻, τ⁺ τ⁻, c c̄, and pairs of lighter quarks (u ū, d d̄, s s̄).

Hypothetically, if neutrinos are Dirac fermions and have some mass, m_nu << GeV, assuming even up to a few GeV, but in reality, they're much lighter. If neutrinos are considered as possible decay products (assuming neutrino and antineutrino?), but since in the Lagrangian it's written asψ_f which could include neutrinos, though typically neutrinos are neutral but in standard model, the right-handed neutrinos might not be present unless it's a Dirac particle.

However, if the neutrinos are Majorana, they're their own antiparticles, but in this interaction term, without more knowledge, it's unclear. Also, neutrinos have negligible mass (< eV), so 2m_nu<< GeV, so even kinematically allowed but perhaps not physically because of charge neutrality.

However assuming that particle and antiparticle have opposite charges, then decaying into neutrinos would imply X is charged (if neutrino/anti are different) but X here is likely a neutral scalar, so can decay into neutral pairs. But in the lagrangian term, the interaction uses coupling between X and fermion pairs (ψ_f) and (bar), so same as Yukawa coupling.

For example, in the Standard Model, you have h \bar{\psi}\psi, which for neutrinos (if Dirac) would exist. If interactions for neutrinos exist in this model, then X → ν ν̄ would be possible. However, since ν's are neutral, requires that such a term is allowed with X coupling to neutrinos, which they are neutral.

But neutrinos' masses are so tiny that coupling could be smaller, but in terms of kinematics, as mass is negligible, the decay is possible but the momentum carried by the ν would be ~3 GeV each. However, but even here, standard model particles. But the problem might be considering charged fermion pairs.

Alternatively, given that in the SM, Higgs does not couple to neutrinos (in the minimal SM without right-handed neutrinos), but here, if the Lagrangian for X allows ψ_f to include neutrinos, which depends on model specifics. Since problem doesn't specify whether neutrinos are included, but increasing prudence in determination.

But unless told otherwise, perhaps considered X decays to charged fermions, but let's check.

So possibilities are:

-Charged leptons: e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ−
-Quarks: u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄

Now, bottom quarks would require X mass at least 8.36 GeV which is greater than 6 GeV so t/F.

But same with top quarks (massive), so negligible. 

Hence, the kinematically allowed decays (at lowest order, ie tree level) are X decaying into respective charged lepton pairs and quark pairs for the lighter quarks and above.

But quarks get confined, so actual decays would result in jets, but abstractly like quark-antiquark.

However, since the problem asks for the decays kinematically allowed, i.e., which particles can it decay into regardless of the detection signature.

Hence, the answer would be:

X can decay into any charged lepton-antilepton pair (e+ e-, μ+mu−, τ+ τ−) and quark-antiquark pairs where the quark is u, d, s, or c. The decay into bottom-antibottom pairs would require X mass greater than twice the bottom mass, which is 4.18 GeV*2 =8.36 GeV >6 GeV, so forbidden. Similarly, tops are heavier.

Thus the allowed decays at tree level (lowest order) are X→ e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, and quark pairs uū, dd̄, ss̄, cc̄. Therefore, write all these as kinematically allowed.

But how to best present this? Because including all the quark flavors...

Alternatively, use groups. Since the up-type quarks (u, c) and down-type (d, s, b). Given that m_c=1.27, allowable but...

Actually, for up quark it's pair ū. So data:

Up quark: negligible (so freely allowed)

Charm quark: allowed; pair is c c̄

All other quarks (d, s) masses under 3 GeV (combined pairs would be 2*mass. Even in pair s s̄, would be 0.192 GeV in combined mass.

Total rate whereas takeaway: m_X has 6 GeV, which is more than sufficient, regardless of the fermion's own mass. Hence, since they are all under 3 GeV (tau at 1.777 gives 3.554 GeV total), All are allowed.

So the answer is that all possible fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermions has mass ≤3 GeV would be kinematically allowed. Thus, considering Standard Model charged leptons and the first four quarks (u, d, s, c), and their antiparticles. So the decay channels are:

- Charged leptons: e+e−, μ+μ−, τ+τ−

- Quarks: uū, dd̄, ss̄, cc̄

Therefore, that's the answer.

But as quarks are confined, the actual decay would result in hadrons but that's beyond the kinematic consideration.

Hence, the kinematically allowed decays are all these fermion pairs.

Alternatively, if the interaction term involves only specific fermions (although problem does not say that) but given the problem states "interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions" as given by the quoted Lagrangian. Hence, that particular Lagrangian might suggest coupling to all fermions ψ_f where λ_f is non-zero, but we aren't told which f's are present; so need to assume all possible. Therefore, all mentioned are possible.

Thus, compiling the answer.

**Final Answer**
The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order are \( X \to e^+ e^- \), \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \), and \( X \to c \bar{c} \). These are boxed as follows:
