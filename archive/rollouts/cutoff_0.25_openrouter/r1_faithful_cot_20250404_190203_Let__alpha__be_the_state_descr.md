To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( | \alpha \rangle \). The state is proportional to \( (1 + i) | \text{up} \rangle + (2 - i) | \text{down} \rangle \). The normalization factor is calculated by finding the modulus squared of the coefficients:

- The modulus squared of \( 1 + i \) is \( 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \).
- The modulus squared of \( 2 - i \) is \( 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5 \).

Summing these gives \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalized state is:
\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1 + i}{\sqrt{7}} | \text{up} \rangle + \frac{2 - i}{\sqrt{7}} | \text{down} \rangle
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \) and 0 otherwise. This matrix is:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]
which is the Pauli-\( x \) matrix scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are \( | +x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \text{up} \rangle + | \text{down} \rangle) \) and \( | -x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \text{up} \rangle - | \text{down} \rangle) \).

To find the probabilities of measuring these eigenstates, we calculate the inner products \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \) and \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \):

1. For \( \langle +x | \alpha \rangle \):
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1 + i) + (2 - i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]
The probability is \( \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \).

2. For \( \langle -x | \alpha \rangle \):
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1 + i) - (2 - i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]
The probability is \( \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \).

The average value of the operator \( A \) is calculated using either the probabilities and eigenvalues or the expectation value. Using the expectation value approach:
\[
\langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{(1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i)}{7} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( | +x \rangle \) and \( | -x \rangle \) are \( \frac{9}{14} \) and \( \frac{5}{14} \), respectively, and the average value of the operator \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}}, \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me see. I have this problem where the electron is in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. First, I need to figure out the normalization factor for |alpha>. To do that, I remember that the state vector should have a norm of 1. So, I have to compute the square of the absolute values of the coefficients and add them up, then take the square root to get the normalization constant. Let's do that step by step.

The coefficients are (1 + i) and (2 - i). The absolute square of (1 + i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, right? Wait, because for a complex number a + bi, the modulus squared is a² + b². So, (1 + i) has modulus squared 1² + 1² = 2. Similarly, for (2 - i), modulus squared is 2² + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So adding them up, the total is 2 + 5 = 7. Therefore, the normalization factor should be 1/sqrt(7), because the state is proportional to these coefficients. So the normalized |alpha> is [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>. 

Got that part. Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator A. The matrix representation of A is given such that A_ij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection operator, Sz, this operator A must be represented in the same basis. The problem is asking for the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A, as well as the average value of A.

First, let's figure out what operator A is. The matrix given has 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal. So:

A = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

Wait, is that right? Because if i ≠ j, then A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, while A_11 and A_22 are 0. So yes, that matrix looks correct. That's actually the Pauli x matrix times hbar/2. Because the Pauli x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) σ_x. Therefore, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the same as the eigenstates of the x-component of spin. 

So, recalling that the eigenstates of S_x are |+x> and |−x>, which in the z-basis are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Therefore, the eigenstates of A should be these, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2, because A is ħ/2 times σ_x, which has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, let me check that. If σ_x has eigenvalues 1 and -1, then when you multiply by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So yes, A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 and the corresponding eigenstates are |+x> and |−x> as above.

Therefore, to calculate the probability of measuring each eigenstate, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, and then take the modulus squared of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates are given by |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), we can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, and find the coefficients. The probability of each eigenstate is then the square of the modulus of those coefficients.

Alternatively, the probability to measure |+x> is |<+x | alpha>|², and similarly for |−x>. That's perhaps a more straightforward approach.

Let me proceed with that. So first, compute <+x | alpha> and <−x | alpha>.

First, let's write |alpha> in components. The normalized |alpha> is [(1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7)]^T.

The bra vector <+x| in the z-basis is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the conjugate transpose is [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)].

Similarly, <−x| is [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

Therefore,

<+x | alpha> = [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] * [(1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7)]^T

= (1/sqrt(2))( (1 + i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )

= [ (1 + i + 2 - i ) / sqrt(14) ]

= (3) / sqrt(14)

So the coefficient is 3 / sqrt(14), hence probability |3 / sqrt(14)|² = 9/14.

Similarly, <−x | alpha> = [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)] * [(1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7)]^T

= (1/sqrt(2))( (1 + i)/sqrt(7) - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )

= [ (1 + i - 2 + i ) / sqrt(14) ]

= ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)

Therefore, the coefficient is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14. 

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for the +x and -x eigenstates respectively.

Hmm, but wait, since the question refers to "the eigenstates of the operator A", which are |+x> and |−x>, these probabilities should be correct. But let me check the calculation again.

First, for <+x | alpha>:

(1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) =

(1/sqrt(2*7)) [ (1 + 2) + (i - i) ] = (3)/sqrt(14). That seems right. The imaginary parts cancel. So modulus squared is 9/14.

For <−x | alpha>:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) =

[1 + i - 2 + i] / sqrt(14) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) as before. The squared modulus is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] = 1 + 4 = 5. Divide by 14, so 5/14. That adds up to 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1. So that's good.

So probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for the two eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |−x>. So first part done.

Now, the average value of the operator A.

There are two ways to compute this. One is by using the probabilities times eigenvalues, and the other is to compute <alpha | A | alpha>.

Since eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, the average value would be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = (9 - 5)/14 * ħ/2 = (4/14)(ħ/2) = (2/7)(ħ/2) = ħ/7.

Alternatively, compute <alpha | A | alpha>.

Given that |alpha> is normalized, and A is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]

So in matrix form, |alpha> is [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then A acting on |alpha> is:

(ħ/2) * [0 1; 1 0] * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^

Which gives (ħ/2)/sqrt(7) * [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]^T.

So then the inner product <alpha | A | alpha> is (ħ/2)/sqrt(7) * [ conjugate((1 + i))*(2 - i) + conjugate((2 - i))*(1 + i) ] / sqrt(7)

Simplifying:

(ħ/2)/7 * [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

First compute (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i*i = 2 - i -2i + (-1) = 2 - 3i -1 = 1 - 3i.

Second term (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 + 2i + i + (-1) = 1 + 3i.

Adding both terms: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2. So the whole thing is (ħ/2)/7 * 2 = ħ/7. Which matches the previous result.

Therefore, the average value is ħ/7.

So in summary, probabilities are 9/14, 5/14, and average value ħ/7.

Let me make sure there were no errors in the calculation. For the probabilities, the key step was expressing the inner products with |+x> and |−x>. For the expectation value, both methods gave the same result. So it's correct.

**Final Answer**
The probability of measuring each eigenstate is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}} and \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, and the average value of the operator is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}.

Alright, let me examine this issue. I have a problem regarding an electron in state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Initially, I need to determine the normalization factor for |alpha>. To accomplish this, I recall that a state vector must have a norm of 1. Therefore, I need to calculate the square of the absolute values of the coefficients, sum them, then find the square root to determine the normalization constant. I'll work through this systematically.

The coefficients are (1 + i) and (2 - i). The absolute square of (1 + i) equals (1)² + (1)² = 2, correct? Actually, yes, because for a complex number a + bi, the modulus squared equals a² + b². Thus, (1 + i) has modulus squared 1² + 1² = 2. Similarly, for (2 - i), the modulus squared is 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5. Adding these values gives a total of 2 + 5 = 7. Consequently, the normalization factor should be 1/sqrt(7), as the state is proportional to these coefficients. The normalized |alpha> is therefore [(1 + i)/sqrt(7)]|up> + [(2 - i)/sqrt(7)]|down>.

I've completed that section. Now, the subsequent part concerns measuring the eigenstates of an operator A.

Sure, here's a rephrased version of the text:

Let me take a look. I've got this issue where the electron is in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I need to determine the normalization factor for |alpha>. To do this, I recall that the state vector must have a norm of 1. Thus, I must calculate the square of the absolute values of the coefficients, sum them up, and then take the square root to find the normalization constant. Let’s progress step by step.

The coefficients are (1 + i) and (2 - i). The absolute square of (1 + i) is calculated as (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, correct? Hold on, though, because for a complex number a + bi, the modulus squared is a² + b². Therefore, the modulus squared for (1 + i) is 1² + 1² = 2. Similarly, for (2 - i), the modulus squared is 2² + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. Adding them together gives a total of 2 + 5 = 7. Thus, the normalization factor should be 1/sqrt(7), because the state is proportional to these coefficients. Hence, the normalized |alpha> becomes [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Okay, I have that part. The next step involves measuring the eigenstates of an operator A.

The problem asks for the probabilities of detecting the particle in each of the eigenstates of A, along with the average value of A.

First, let's identify what operator A is. The given matrix has 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonals. Therefore:

A = (hbar/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

Is that correct? Since if i ≠ j, A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, wh

So yes, that matrix is correct. Hmm. The Pauli matrices are usually sigma_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]], sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], sigma_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So, this operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. Therefore, A is the x-component of the spin operator multiplied by hbar/2, but seems similar to the Pauli-X matrix scaled by hbar/2. But wait, actually the Pauli matrices are multiplied by hbar/2 for the spin operators. So S_x = (hbar/2) sigma_x, which is exactly this A. Therefore, the operator here is the S_x operator. That might help later. \n\nBut let's see the eigenstates of S_x. Since S_x has eigenstates |right> and |left>, which are the eigenstates for spin in the x-direction. Alternatively, they can be represented in terms of |up> and |down>. Let me recall the eigenstates. For sigma_x, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. The eigenstates are (1/sqrt(2))( |up> + |down> ) for eigenvalue +1, and (1/sqrt(2))( |up> - |down> ) for eigenvalue -1. So, translated to spin states, the eigenstates of S_x are ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) and ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2). \n\nTherefore, the eigenstates of operator A (which is S_x) are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) with eigenvalue hbar/2, and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2) with eigenvalue -hbar/2.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the probability of the state |alpha> being in |+x> or |−x>, and then the average value of A (which could be found either through the probabilities multiplied by eigenvalues or directly by calculating <alpha| A |alpha>).\n\nSo, first step, since |alpha> is given in the z-basis, and we need to express it in the x-basis to compute probabilities. Alternatively, we can compute the inner product between |alpha> and |+x>, |−x> and find the square of the modulus.\n\nLet me write down |alpha> in components. Since |alpha> is:\n\n|alpha> = [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.\n\nLet’s denote the coefficients as a and b:\n\na = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)\n\nb = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)\n\nSo |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>.\n\nThen, to find the probability of getting +x, we calculate |<+x | alpha>|².\n\nSimilarly, probability of -x is |<−x | alpha>|².\n\nLet me compute <+x | alpha> first.\n\nRecall that <+x| is the bra vector corresponding to |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Therefore, <+x| = ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, <+x | alpha> = ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) * [ a |up> + b |down> ]\n\n= [ <up| a |up> + <up| b |down> + <down| a |up> + <down| b |down> ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSince <up|up> = 1, <up|down> = 0, same for <down|down> = 1, <down|up> = 0. So:\n\n<+x | alpha> = [ a * 1 + 0 + 0 + b * 1 ] / sqrt(2) = (a + b) / sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, <−x | alpha> = [ a - b ] / sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, the probability for +x is |(a + b)/sqrt(2)|^2 = |a + b|² / 2\n\nSimilarly, for -x: |(a - b)/sqrt(2)|² = |a - b|² / 2\n\nSo let's compute a + b and a - b.\n\nFirst, a + b:\n\na = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)\n\nb = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)\n\nSo, sum: (1 + i + 2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (3)/sqrt(7). Wait, the i terms cancel?\n\nWait: (1 + i) + (2 - i) = 1 + 2 + i - i = 3 + 0i = 3. Therefore, sum is 3/sqrt(7). Then (a + b) is 3/sqrt(7). So modulus squared is (9)/7.\n\nThen the probability is |a + b|² / 2 = (9/7)/2 = 9/(14).\n\nSimilarly, a - b: (1 + i) - (2 - i) = 1 - 2 + i + i = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7)\n\nTherefore, the modulus squared of a - b is | -1 + 2i |². Let's compute that:\n\n(-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 + 4 = 5. Then divided by 7, since each term of a and b has a denominator sqrt(7), but the numerator as (-1 + 2i), so the modulus squared is 5/7. Therefore, the probability is 5/7 divided by 2, which is 5/(14).\n\nLet me check:\n\nProbability for +x: |a + b|² / 2 = (9/7)/2 = 9/14\n\nProbability for -x: |a - b|² / 2 = (5/7)/2 = 5/14\n\nIndeed, 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for +x and -x respectively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should think of hbar/2 as the eigenvalue of A. Wait, the eigenvalues of operator A should be ± hbar/2, as the matrix A is (hbar/2)*sigma_x, whose eigenvalues are ± hbar/2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the state \( | \alpha \rangle \). The given state is proportional to \((1 + i) | \text{up} \rangle + (2 - i) | \text{down} \rangle \). The normalization factor is calculated by finding the modulus squared of the coefficients and taking the square root of their sum:

\[
\text{Modulus squared of } (1 + i) = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2
\]
\[
\text{Modulus squared of } (2 - i) = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5
\]
\[
\text{Total} = 2 + 5 = 7 \implies \text{Normalization factor} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1 + i)}{\sqrt{7}} | \text{up} \rangle + \frac{(2 - i)}{\sqrt{7}} | \text{down} \rangle
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix representation:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) (which is the \( S_x \) operator) are:
\[
| +x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \text{up} \rangle + | \text{down} \rangle)
\]
\[
| -x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \text{up} \rangle - | \text{down} \rangle)
\]

We calculate the probabilities of measuring \( | \alpha \rangle \) in these eigenstates by finding the inner products:
\[
\langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1 + i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2 - i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
\]
\[
\langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1 + i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2 - i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
\]

The probabilities are the modulus squared of these inner products divided by 2:
\[
\text{Probability for } | +x \rangle = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}
\]
\[
\text{Probability for } | -x \rangle = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}
\]

For the average value of \( A \), we use either the probabilities and eigenvalues or directly compute \( \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Both methods yield:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}
\]

### Final Answer

The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator are \boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}} and \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, and the average value is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

iles A_11 and A_22 are 0. So yes, that matrix is correct. Hmm. The Pauli matrices are usually sigma_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]], sigma_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]], sigma_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So, this operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. Therefore, A is the x-component of the spin operator multiplied by hbar/2, but seems similar to the Pauli-X matrix scaled by hbar/2. But wait, actually the Pauli matrices are multiplied by hbar/2 for the spin operators. So S_x = (hbar/2) sigma_x, which is exactly this A. Therefore, the operator here is the S_x operator. That might help later. 

But let's see the eigenstates of S_x. Since S_x has eigenstates |right> and |left>, which are the eigenstates for spin in the x-direction. Alternatively, they can be represented in terms of |up> and |down>. Let me recall the eigenstates. For sigma_x, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. The eigenstates are (1/sqrt(2))( |up> + |down> ) for eigenvalue +1, and (1/sqrt(2))( |up> - |down> ) for eigenvalue -1. So, translated to spin states, the eigenstates of S_x are ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) and ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2). 

Therefore, the eigenstates of operator A (which is S_x) are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) with eigenvalue hbar/2, and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2) with eigenvalue -hbar/2.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the probability of the state |alpha> being in |+x> or |−x>, and then the average value of A (which could be found either through the probabilities multiplied by eigenvalues or directly by calculating <alpha| A |alpha>).

So, first step, since |alpha> is given in the z-basis, and we need to express it in the x-basis to compute probabilities. Alternatively, we can compute the inner product between |alpha> and |+x>, |−x> and find the square of the modulus.

Let me write down |alpha> in components. Since |alpha> is:

|alpha> = [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Let’s denote the coefficients as a and b:

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)

b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>.

Then, to find the probability of getting +x, we calculate |<+x | alpha>|².

Similarly, probability of -x is |<−x | alpha>|².

Let me compute <+x | alpha> first.

Recall that <+x| is the bra vector corresponding to |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Therefore, <+x| = ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

Therefore, <+x | alpha> = ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) * [ a |up> + b |down> ]

= [ <up| a |up> + <up| b |down> + <down| a |up> + <down| b |down> ] / sqrt(2)

Since <up|up> = 1, <up|down> = 0, same for <down|down> = 1, <down|up> = 0. So:

<+x | alpha> = [ a * 1 + 0 + 0 + b * 1 ] / sqrt(2) = (a + b) / sqrt(2)

Similarly, <−x | alpha> = [ a - b ] / sqrt(2)

Therefore, the probability for +x is |(a + b)/sqrt(2)|^2 = |a + b|² / 2

Similarly, for -x: |(a - b)/sqrt(2)|² = |a - b|² / 2

So let's compute a + b and a - b.

First, a + b:

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)

b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So, sum: (1 + i + 2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (3)/sqrt(7). Wait, the i terms cancel?

Wait: (1 + i) + (2 - i) = 1 + 2 + i - i = 3 + 0i = 3. Therefore, sum is 3/sqrt(7). Then (a + b) is 3/sqrt(7). So modulus squared is (9)/7.

Then the probability is |a + b|² / 2 = (9/7)/2 = 9/(14).

Similarly, a - b: (1 + i) - (2 - i) = 1 - 2 + i + i = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7)

Therefore, the modulus squared of a - b is | -1 + 2i |². Let's compute that:

(-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 + 4 = 5. Then divided by 7, since each term of a and b has a denominator sqrt(7), but the numerator as (-1 + 2i), so the modulus squared is 5/7. Therefore, the probability is 5/7 divided by 2, which is 5/(14).

Let me check:

Probability for +x: |a + b|² / 2 = (9/7)/2 = 9/14

Probability for -x: |a - b|² / 2 = (5/7)/2 = 5/14

Indeed, 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1, which is correct.

Therefore, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for +x and -x respectively.

Alternatively, maybe we should think of hbar/2 as the eigenvalue of A. Wait, the eigenvalues of operator A should be ± hbar/2, as the matrix A is (hbar/2)*sigma_x, whose eigenvalues are ± hbar/2.

But the question is asking for the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. So yes, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. So the answer should be 9/14 and 5/14.

Now, the average value of the operator. That can be computed either by summing the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues, or directly by calculating <alpha| A |alpha>.

Let's do both to check.

First method: Average = P(+x)*(hbar/2) + P(-x)*(-hbar/2) = (9/14)*(hbar/2) + (5/14)*(-hbar/2) = (9 - 5)/14 * hbar/2 = (4/14)*(hbar/2) = (2/7)*hbar/2 = (1/7) hbar.

Hmm.

Second method: compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

So |alpha> is [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] in the z-basis. A is hbar/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]].

Therefore, A |alpha> is hbar/2 * [ ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ), ( (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is hbar/2 times the inner product of |alpha> and A|alpha>

Wait, the inner product should be conjugate transpose of |alpha> times A|alpha>.

So let's compute:

First, A|alpha> has components:

Top component: (0*(1 + i)/sqrt(7) + 1*(2 - i)/sqrt(7)) * hbar/2 = (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * hbar/2

Bottom component: (1*(1 + i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 - i)/sqrt(7)) * hbar/2 = (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * hbar/2

Therefore, A|alpha> is hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) times the vector [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]

Then, <alpha| is the conjugate transpose of |alpha>, which is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7)*hbar/2, (1 + i)/sqrt(7)*hbar/2 ]

Therefore, compute:

(1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * hbar/2 + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * hbar/2

Let me factor out hbar/(2*7):

hbar/(2*7) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

Compute each product:

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) - i*2 + i*i = 2 - i - 2i + (-1) = 2 - 3i -1 = 1 - 3i

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 + 2i + i + (-1) = 2 + 3i -1 = 1 + 3i

Adding them together: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2

Therefore, <A> = hbar/(14) * 2 = hbar/7.

Same as before when we computed using probabilities. So, the average value is hbar/7.

Therefore, all checks out. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for measuring eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively, and the average value is hbar/7.

So summarizing:

Probability of +hbar/2 (eigenstate |+x>): 9/14

Probability of -hbar/2 (eigenstate |−x>): 5/14

Average value of A: hbar/7

I should also note that operator A is Hermitian? Let's check if indeed A's matrix is Hermitian. A's matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. The conjugate transpose is the same, so yes, A is Hermitian, which is necessary for it to be an observable. Therefore, everything is consistent.

Thus, the final results are as above.

**Final Answer**

The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator are \boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}} and \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, and the average value is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}.

This looks correct, so A is the operator (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. The Pauli matrices are commonly sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Indeed, sigma_x has matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]], so A = (hbar/2) sigma_x.\n\nTherefore, operator A is the x-component of the spin angular momentum multiplied by hbar/2. The eigenstates of sigma_x (and hence A) must be considered. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-direction, which are different from the z-direction eigenstates provided by |up> and |down>. For sigma_x, the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, defined as superpositions of |up> and |down>.\n\nFor instance, the eigenstates of sigma_x (= [[0,1],[1,0]]) are given by:\n\nFor eigenvalue +1: 1/sqrt(2)(|up> + |down>)\n\nFor eigenvalue -1: 1/sqrt(2)(|up> − |down>)\n\nHence, when expressed in terms of the z-basis (our current basis), they are these equal superpositions.\n\nSo, the matrix A has eigenvalues hbar/2 (from (hbar/2)*1) and -hbar/2 (from (hbar/2)*(-1)), with eigenstates |+x> and |−x> respectively.\n\nTherefore, to compute the probability of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of A, I need to express the given normalized state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, and compute the modulus squared of the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, another method would be to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate |+x> and |−x>, then take the absolute square. Either approach should work.\n\nLet me proceed step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let\'s confirm the exact expressions for |+x> and |−x>:\n\n|+x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> + |down>)\n\n|−x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> – |down>)\n\nTherefore, applying the bra <+x| to |alpha>:\n\n<+x|alpha> = 1/sqrt(2)[<up| + <down|] [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]\n\nMultiplying this in components:\n\nFirst component from <up|:(1 + i)/sqrt(7) times 1/sqrt(2)\n\nSecond component from <down|:(2 - i)/sqrt(7) times 1/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, sum equals:\n\n[ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) \n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(1 + 2) + (i - i) = 3 + 0i\n\nTherefore, the amplitude is 3 / sqrt(14)\n\nThus, |<+x | alpha>|² = (9 / 14)\n\nSimilarly, compute <−x | alpha>:\n\nSimilarly, <−x|alpha> = 1/sqrt(2)[<up| – <down|] [ ... ]\n\nSo, same components:\n\n(1 + i)/sqrt(7) times 1/sqrt(2)\n\nMinus (2 - i)/sqrt(7) times 1/sqrt(2)\n\nSum: [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(14))\n\nCalculate numerator: (1 - 2) + (i + i) = (-1 + 2i)\n\nThus, the amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)\n\nTherefore, the modulus squared is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2]/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for eigenstates |+x> and |−x> respectively. Let me verify:\n\nAlternatively, probabilities should sum to 1, and 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1. Checks out.\n\nPerfect. So the probability of measuring eigenvalue +hbar/2 is 9/14, and -hbar/2 is 5/14.\n\nAlternatively, due to in-class variations, perhaps more straightforwardly, the operator A can be written as a matrix, and one could try to solve for the expectations using the algebraic average value formula. However, the previous approach is also acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says: "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator" which would correspond to these eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, so the number matches.\n\nBut perhaps to ensure:\n\nAnother method to calculate probabilities of eigenvalues is by expressing the state as a column vector in the z-basis and the operator expressed as a matrix. But to compute the probabilities for an observable\'s eigenstates, the formula is |<eigenstate|state>|² directly, which is what I did.\n\nThus, the answer for the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. The question also asks for the average value of that operator. The average value can be calculated as:\n\n⟨A⟩ = <alpha| A |alpha>\n\nGiven that A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.\n\nSince |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis (since up and down are Sz eigenstates), so to compute ⟨A⟩, I can write out the matrix components and compute the expectation value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps matrix multiplication is easier.\n\nExpressed as a vector in the z-basis, the normalized |alpha> is:\n\n[ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) , (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T\n\nSo, the A matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]\n\nCalculating ⟨A⟩ then is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.\n\nSo,\n\n( (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) * [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * ( (1 + i)/sqrt(7) , (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )^T\n\nMultiplying this out:\n\nFirst, the matrix-vector product:\n\nFirst component: 0 * (1 + i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7)\n\nSecond component: (hbar/2) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7) + 0 * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7)\n\nNow, take the dot product with the bra vector:\n\n[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7) , (hbar/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]^T\n\nThis gives:\n\n(1 - i)*(hbar/2)(2 - i)/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(7)) + (2 + i)*(hbar/2)(1 + i)/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(7))\n\nSince sqrt(7)*sqrt(7)=7, so:\n\n-> hbar/(2*7) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ] )\n\nNow compute the terms in the brackets.\n\nFirst term: (1 - i)(2 - i). Multiply out:\n\n1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 - i - 2i + i² = 2 - 3i + (-1) = 1 - 3i\n\nSecond term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 + 2i + i + i² = 2 + 3i -1 = 1 + 3i\n\nAdding these terms: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\nhbar/(14) * 2 = hbar*(2)/14 = hbar/7\n\nTherefore, the average value ⟨A⟩ is hbar/7.\n\nWait a moment, the average value is hbar divided by 7?

To find the probability of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of the operator \( A \) and the average value of \( A \), we follow these steps:

1. **Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \):**
   The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|{\uparrow}\rangle + (2-i)|{\downarrow}\rangle \). The normalization factor is calculated as:
   \[
   \sqrt{|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2} = \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7}
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|{\uparrow}\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|{\downarrow}\rangle
   \]

2. **Identify the operator \( A \):**
   The matrix representation of \( A \) is:
   \[
   A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   This is the Pauli-X matrix multiplied by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \), with eigenstates \( |{+x}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|{\uparrow}\rangle + |{\downarrow}\rangle) \) and \( |{-x}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|{\uparrow}\rangle - |{\downarrow}\rangle) \).

3. **Calculate probabilities:**
   - The inner product with \( |{+x}\rangle \):
     \[
     \langle {+x} | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}
     \]
     Probability: \( \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \)

   - The inner product with \( |{-x}\rangle \):
     \[
     \langle {-x} | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}
     \]
     Probability: \( \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \)

4. **Calculate the average value of \( A \):**
   Using the expectation value formula:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{14} \left[ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) \right] = \frac{\hbar}{7}
   \]

### Final Answer

The probabilities are \(\boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}}\) and \(\boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}\), and the average value is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

iles A_11 and A_22 are 0. This looks correct, so A is the operator (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. The Pauli matrices are commonly sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Indeed, sigma_x has matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]], so A = (hbar/2) sigma_x.

Therefore, operator A is the x-component of the spin angular momentum multiplied by hbar/2. The eigenstates of sigma_x (and hence A) must be considered. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-direction, which are different from the z-direction eigenstates provided by |up> and |down>. For sigma_x, the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, defined as superpositions of |up> and |down>.

For instance, the eigenstates of sigma_x (= [[0,1],[1,0]]) are given by:

For eigenvalue +1: 1/sqrt(2)(|up> + |down>)

For eigenvalue -1: 1/sqrt(2)(|up> − |down>)

Hence, when expressed in terms of the z-basis (our current basis), they are these equal superpositions.

So, the matrix A has eigenvalues hbar/2 (from (hbar/2)*1) and -hbar/2 (from (hbar/2)*(-1)), with eigenstates |+x> and |−x> respectively.

Therefore, to compute the probability of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of A, I need to express the given normalized state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, and compute the modulus squared of the coefficients.

Alternatively, another method would be to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate |+x> and |−x>, then take the absolute square. Either approach should work.

Let me proceed step-by-step.

First, let's confirm the exact expressions for |+x> and |−x>:

|+x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> + |down>)

|−x> = 1/sqrt(2)(|up> – |down>)

Therefore, applying the bra <+x| to |alpha>:

<+x|alpha> = 1/sqrt(2)[<up| + <down|] [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Multiplying this in components:

First component from <up|:(1 + i)/sqrt(7) times 1/sqrt(2)

Second component from <down|:(2 - i)/sqrt(7) times 1/sqrt(2)

So, sum equals:

[ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) ) 

Simplify numerator:

(1 + 2) + (i - i) = 3 + 0i

Therefore, the amplitude is 3 / sqrt(14)

Thus, |<+x | alpha>|² = (9 / 14)

Similarly, compute <−x | alpha>:

Similarly, <−x|alpha> = 1/sqrt(2)[<up| – <down|] [ ... ]

So, same components:

(1 + i)/sqrt(7) times 1/sqrt(2)

Minus (2 - i)/sqrt(7) times 1/sqrt(2)

Sum: [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(14))

Calculate numerator: (1 - 2) + (i + i) = (-1 + 2i)

Thus, the amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Therefore, the modulus squared is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2]/14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14

Therefore, the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for eigenstates |+x> and |−x> respectively. Let me verify:

Alternatively, probabilities should sum to 1, and 9/14 + 5/14 = 14/14 = 1. Checks out.

Perfect. So the probability of measuring eigenvalue +hbar/2 is 9/14, and -hbar/2 is 5/14.

Alternatively, due to in-class variations, perhaps more straightforwardly, the operator A can be written as a matrix, and one could try to solve for the expectations using the algebraic average value formula. However, the previous approach is also acceptable.

But the problem says: "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator" which would correspond to these eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, so the number matches.

But perhaps to ensure:

Another method to calculate probabilities of eigenvalues is by expressing the state as a column vector in the z-basis and the operator expressed as a matrix. But to compute the probabilities for an observable's eigenstates, the formula is |<eigenstate|state>|² directly, which is what I did.

Thus, the answer for the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. The question also asks for the average value of that operator. The average value can be calculated as:

⟨A⟩ = <alpha| A |alpha>

Given that A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Since |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis (since up and down are Sz eigenstates), so to compute ⟨A⟩, I can write out the matrix components and compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, perhaps matrix multiplication is easier.

Expressed as a vector in the z-basis, the normalized |alpha> is:

[ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) , (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

So, the A matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

Calculating ⟨A⟩ then is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A multiplied by |alpha>.

So,

( (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ) * [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]] * ( (1 + i)/sqrt(7) , (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )^T

Multiplying this out:

First, the matrix-vector product:

First component: 0 * (1 + i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Second component: (hbar/2) * (1 + i)/sqrt(7) + 0 * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7)

Now, take the dot product with the bra vector:

[ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) , (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7) , (hbar/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

This gives:

(1 - i)*(hbar/2)(2 - i)/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(7)) + (2 + i)*(hbar/2)(1 + i)/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(7))

Since sqrt(7)*sqrt(7)=7, so:

-> hbar/(2*7) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ] )

Now compute the terms in the brackets.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i). Multiply out:

1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) = 2 - i - 2i + i² = 2 - 3i + (-1) = 1 - 3i

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 + 2i + i + i² = 2 + 3i -1 = 1 + 3i

Adding these terms: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2

So, the expression becomes:

hbar/(14) * 2 = hbar*(2)/14 = hbar/7

Therefore, the average value ⟨A⟩ is hbar/7.

Wait a moment, the average value is hbar divided by 7? Alternatively, let's verify the computation:

First term (1 - i)(2 - i):

1*2 = 2

1*(-i) = -i

(-i)*2 = -2i

(-i)*(-i) = i² = -1

So overall: 2 - i - 2i -1 = 1 - 3i

Second term (2 +i)(1 +i):

2*1 = 2

2*i = 2i

i*1 = i

i*i = i²= -1

Total: 2 + 2i + i -1 = 1 + 3i

Yes, that's correct. Then, adding 1 - 3i +1 +3i=2. The hbar/14 *2 = hbar /7.

Therefore confirming that’s correct. Thus, the expectation is hbar/7. So that would be the average value. Alternatively, eigenvalues of A are +/- hbar/2, you have probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, so the average is:

(9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = (9/14 - 5/14)(hbar/2) = (4/14)(hbar/2) = (2/7)(hbar/2) = hbar/7.

Wait, this also calculates to hbar/7. Thus, that's a second way to calculate it, which gives the same result. Therefore, the average value is indeed hbar over 7. So, that matches both methods. Hence, that's confirmed.

Therefore:

Probability in |+x>: 9/14

Probability in |-x>: 5/14

Average value ⟨A⟩: hbar/7

I guess the problem says "Calculate the probability... of each of the eigenstates", so order matters. Assuming the operator's eigenstates are ordered in +/- 1 eigenvalues, so similarly, probabilities correspond to + first, then –. So the answer would be boxed probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, and hbar/7.

Thus, to check, does the process seem accurate? Let me re-examine:

- Correct normalization? Yes, coefficients |1 + i|²=2, |2 - i|²=5, sum 7, sqrt(7) denominator.

- Eigenstates of Pauli X matrix as |+x>, found inner products which gave amplitude 3/sqrt(14) leading to probability 9/14.

For |−x>, similar steps yielded (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) of modulus squared (1 + 4)/14=5/14. Correct.

Then finally the average via operator produces hbar/7. Both approaches confirm that. Therefore, I think everything is correct.

**Final Answer**

The probabilities are \boxed{\dfrac{9}{14}} and \boxed{\dfrac{5}{14}}, and the average value is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{7}}.

**Probability of Measuring Each Eigenstate:**

The eigenstates of the operator A (which is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix) are |+x〉 and |−x〉, corresponding to the eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. The probabilities of measuring these eigenvalues are determined by projecting the state |α〉 onto each eigenstate and computing the squared magnitudes:

1. **Probability for +ħ/2:**
   \[
   P\left(+\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \left|\langle +x | \alpha \rangle\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}
   \]

2. **Probability for -ħ/2:**
   \[
   P\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \left|\langle -x | \alpha \rangle\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}
   \]

**Average Value of the Operator A:**

The expectation value of the operator A in the state |α〉 can be calculated directly or by using the probabilities and eigenvalues. Both methods yield:

iles A_11 and A_22 are 0. That’s the sigma_x Pauli matrix scaled by hbar/2. So A = (hbar/2) σ_x. Indeed, σ_x is:

[0,1;
1,0].

Thus, A is proportional to the Pauli-X matrix. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A will be ±hbar/2, and the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x.

Wait, the eigenstates of σ_x (the spin-x operator) are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Alternatively, you can write them as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)), with eigenvalues +1 and -1. So, scaling by hbar/2, the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |−x> with eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

Thus, the problem reduces to rewriting the state |alpha> in the x-basis (eigenbasis of A) and then squaring the coefficients to find the probabilities for each eigenstate.

Alternatively, one can compute the probabilities by taking the inner products of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A. That is, the probability P(+hbar/2) is |<+x | alpha>|² and P(-hbar/2) is |<−x | alpha>|². Let’s first attempt to compute these.

Firstly we need the expressions for |+x> and |−x>. As I've written:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Therefore, the inner product <+x|alpha> is:

= [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Multiplying this out:

= [ ( (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * <down|up ) + ( (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * <up|down> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down> ) ] / sqrt(2)

But the inner products are like Kronecker deltas, so <up|up> = 1, <down|down> =1; cross terms, like <up|down> =0. So simplifying:

= [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)

Sum up the numerators:

(1 + i + 2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (3)/sqrt(7)

Thus:

<+x | alpha> = 3/sqrt(7) / sqrt(2) = 3 / sqrt(14)

Therefore, the probability P(+x) is |3 / sqrt(14)|² = 9/14.

Similarly, compute <−x | alpha>:

= [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Again, expand:

= [ ( (1 + i)/sqrt(7) * <up|up> - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * <down|down>) ] / sqrt(2)

Cross terms zero as before.

Numeric computation:

= [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)

Sum numerators:

(1 + i -2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)

Thus,

<−x | alpha> = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) / sqrt(2) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

Therefore, the probability P(-x) is |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|². Compute modulus squared:

(-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 + 4 = 5. Thus, 5/14. Therefore, probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 eigenvalues.

Let’s check that probabilities sum to 1: 9 +5 =14, 14/14=1. That seems okay.

Alternatively, I could have diagonalized the operator A, found its eigenvectors, but as I recognize because A is proportional to σ_x, I can use the standard eigenstates. So the answer for the probabilities is 9/14 and 5/14.

Now, for the average value of operator A. There are two approaches. Either use the probabilities multiplied by eigenvalues or compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

First method: average value = P(+x)*(hbar/2) + P(-x)*(-hbar/2)

= (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [9 - 5](hbar)/28 = 4 hbar /28 = hbar /7.

Second method: compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Operator A = hbar/2 [[0,1],[1,0]], so the matrix with 0s on diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

The state |alpha> is expressed as a column vector in the up/down basis: [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Thus, let's perform A|alpha>. First, compute the product:

A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [ [0,1], [1,0] ] * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

This equals (hbar/2) * [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7), (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Now take the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) multiplied by the dot product of [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] (the conjugate transpose of |alpha>) and [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7), (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ].

So compute:

( (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ) /7 multiplied by hbar/2.

First term (1 - i)(2 - i):

= 1*2 + 1*(-i) - i*2 + i*i

= 2 - i -2i + (-1)

= 2 - 3i -1

= 1 - 3i

Second term (2 + i)(1 + i):

= 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 +i*i

= 2 + 2i + i + (-1)

= (2 -1) + 3i

= 1 + 3i

Sum: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2.

Therefore, <alpha| A |alpha> = (2 /7 ) * (hbar/2) = hbar/7.

Perfect, that matches the previous method. Therefore, the average value is ℏ/7.

Therefore, the answers are probabilities 9/14 and 5/14 for the two eigenstates and average value hbar/7.

This seems all right. Let me just verify the normalization again quickly. Coefficient for |up> is (1 + i)/sqrt(7). Its modulus squared is (1² +1²)/7 = 2/7. The |down> coefficient is (2 - i)/sqrt(7), modulus squared: (4 + 1)/7 =5/7, which sums to 1, so normalization is done properly.

Also, check <alpha | alpha> resulting from the computation of operator expectation must equal 1, but that’s a different check. Anyway, both expectation value via two methods have the same result so I’m confident on that.

Yes, looks solid. So final answers: probabilities 9/14 and 5/14, average value ℏ/7.
