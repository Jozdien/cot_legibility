To determine the energy levels for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we follow the Pauli exclusion principle, which allows at most two particles in each spatial orbital (one with spin up and one with spin down). The single-particle energy levels are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \).

### Ground State:
The ground state configuration involves filling the lowest energy levels first:
- Two particles in \( n = 1 \) (energy \( E \))
- Two particles in \( n = 2 \) (energy \( 4E \))

The total energy is calculated as:
\[
2 \times E + 2 \times 4E = 2E + 8E = 10E
\]

### First Excited State:
The first excited state is achieved by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (\( n = 2 \)) to the next available level (\( n = 3 \)):
- Two particles in \( n = 1 \)
- One particle in \( n = 2 \)
- One particle in \( n = 3 \)

The total energy is calculated as:
\[
2 \times E + 1 \times 4E + 1 \times 9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
\]

### Second Excited State:
The second excited state is achieved by promoting one particle from \( n = 1 \) to \( n = 3 \), leaving one particle in \( n = 1 \):
- One particle in \( n = 1 \)
- Two particles in \( n = 2 \)
- One particle in \( n = 3 \)

The total energy is calculated as:
\[
1 \times E + 2 \times 4E + 1 \times 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E
\]

### Final Answer:
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \(\boxed{10E}\), \(\boxed{15E}\), and \(\boxed{18E}\) respectively.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy levels for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The particles are fermions since they have spin-1/2, right? So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which means each quantum state can be occupied by at most two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down). 

The well is one-dimensional, so the single-particle energy levels are given by E_n = n²E, where E is the unit energy defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²). Each energy level n can hold two electrons due to their spin. So the problem is about filling up these energy levels with four particles while obeying the Pauli exclusion principle and then finding the total energy for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Let me recall. For a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are non-degenerate except for the spin degeneracy. So each spatial orbital (each n) can hold two fermions. So first, for the ground state, we need to fill the lowest energy levels first.

Let's tabulate the energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = 1² E = E, holds 2 particles

n=2: E_2 = 4E, holds 2 particles

n=3: E_3 = 9E, holds 2 particles

Wait, but with four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) can hold 2 + 2 = 4 particles. That fills up n=1 and n=2. So the ground state would have all four particles in n=1 and n=2. Then the total energy would be 2*E + 2*4E = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but hold on, each energy level n can hold two particles. So if you have four particles, the lowest two levels will be filled in the ground state. So all four particles are in n=1 and n=2, two each.

But is that correct? Let me check again. For each n, two particles (spin up and down). So the first level (n=1) can hold two, then the next, n=2, can hold another two. Thus, n=1 and n=2 are filled. Then total energy is 2*E + 2*4E = 2E + 8E = 10E. So that would be the ground state.

Now, for the first excited state. The first excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. So what would that be? Instead of having both particles in n=2, maybe one is promoted to the next level.

But wait, with four particles, the ground state has two in n=1 and two in n=2. If we need to create an excited state, we need to promote one of the particles from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). So instead of having two particles in n=2, you have one in n=2 and one in n=3. Then the configuration would be 2 (n=1) + 1 (n=2) + 1 (n=3). But wait, with spin, is that allowed?

But wait, each spatial level can hold two particles. If you have only one particle in n=2, that's okay; same for n=3. So then you have: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy would be 2E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

But wait, is that the first excited state? Or is there another configuration with a lower energy than 15E? Let me see. Let's think of alternative configurations. For four particles, other possibilities to distribute the particles.

Alternatively, if instead we have three particles in lower levels? But how. For example, suppose you have two in n=1, and two in n=3. But why would we skip n=2? You can't, because you need to fill the lowest energy levels first. But in the ground state, you already filled n=1 and n=2.

In an excited state, maybe you can have some particles in higher levels. But without violating Pauli? Let me recap. For fermions, each spatial orbital can have a maximum of two (spin up and down). So the ground state has two in n=1, two in n=2. First excited state would be to take one particle from n=2 and put it into n=3, leading to two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

But maybe there is a different configuration where instead two particles are in higher orbitals with lower total energy. Wait, but higher orbitals have higher energy, so moving particles to higher orbitals will only increase the total energy. However, maybe distributing them differently could lead to lower total energy increase. For example, if instead some particles are moved to higher orbitals but not all possible.

Wait, is there a way of placing three particles in the same level? But no, since Pauli allows only two per level. Therefore, you can't have three in n=1 and one in n=2. So each level can only have 0,1, or 2 particles.

So the possible configurations for four particles:

1. 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2: total energy 2*1E + 2*4E= 10E (ground state)

2. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3: total energy 2*1E +1*4E +1*9E=15E (first excited state?)

3. 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3: total energy 2*1E + 2*9E=20E

Alternatively, maybe 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Total energy 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9=1 +8 +9=18E. But this is higher than 15E, so 15E would be lower. But is configuration 2 allowed?

Wait, to go from the ground state (2,2,0,...) to (2,1,1,...), that would require promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. Since all the particles are identical fermions, they need to have different quantum states. When you promote one particle from n=2 (which had two particles before) to n=3 (which can take two), but now if n=3 is empty, we can put one in there. Then the configuration 2 in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Each with two spins. Now, does that obey the Pauli exclusion principle? Yes, because each spatial level can have up to two, so in this case, n=1 has two, n=2 has one (but since spin can be up or down, why cannot it have two?), ah, hold on. Why do n=2 have only one in the first excited state? Wait, spin is 1/2, which gives two possible states per spatial orbital. If the spatial orbital for n=2 has two particles (spin up and down), and n=3 has two slots, but if you promote one particle from n=2 to n=3, then n=2 would have one particle, and n=3 would have one particle. So both n=2 and n=3 would have one particle each. Wait, but is that correct? Wait, if you have only one particle in n=2, how is that possible?

Wait, each spatial orbital can have two particles. So if you have two particles in n=1 (full), then for the next two particles, in higher orbitals. If you promote a particle, actually in the ground state, particles are filled as: two in n=1 (spin up and down), two in n=2 (spin up and down). To get the first excited state, you need to promote one particle from n=2 to the next available orbital, which is n=3.

But wait a quantum state is defined by the combination of spatial quantum number and spin. So each spatial level can have two particles, one with spin up, one with spin down. So in the ground state, we have two particles in n=1 (spin up and down) and two particles in n=2 (spin up and down).

But if you want to get an excited state, you have to promote one of the particles to a higher energy level. When you promote, say, one of the particles from n=2 to n=3. Since in the ground state, both spins in n=2 are occupied. So promoting one would leave n=2 with one particle (either spin up or down), and n=3 will now have one particle (either spin up or down).

However, when you do this, the total energy increases by 9E -4E =5E from replacing one particle from n=2 to n=3.

So total energy would be 2E (from n=1) + 1*4E (remaining in n=2) +1*9E (in n=3). That calculates to 2 +4 +9=15E.

Alternatively, if you could promote a particle from n=1 to n=2, but n=2 is already full in the ground state. So you cannot because of Pauli exclusion. So the minimal excitation would be to promote to the next available orbital beyond n=2, which is n=3.

Therefore, the first excited state would be 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3: 2 +1 +1 -> total energy 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E. 

But wait, let's check if there's another configuration that could have lower energy. For example, if we put 2 particles in n=1, and 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4, but n=4 is higher (16E), so the total energy would be even higher (2 +4 +16=22E), which is more than 15E. Similarly, putting 1 particle in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3, that would give 1 + 8 +9=18E. Still higher than 15E. 

Alternatively, putting 2 in n=1,0 in n=2, 2 in n=3: this configuration would require first filling n=1 and then n=3? But the problem is that usually, particles fill lower energy orbitals first. To get to 2 in n=3, you'd have to leave n=2 empty when filling, which would not be lower in energy. Therefore, this would be higher than both the ground state and the first excited state.

Hence, 15E is the first excited state.

Now what about the second excited state? What's next after 15E?

Possible configurations:

After 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2,1 in n=3 (15E). The next would be...

Either adding another particle to a higher energy level. For four particles, we need to arrange four in the orbitals. So if we have configurations like 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 (total energy 2 +0 +18=20E). Alternatively, let's see other possibilities:

Wait, promoting another particle from n=2 to n=4 perhaps? So 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3,1 in n=4: but how? Let me check.

Wait, in the ground state (n=1, n=2 filled). To get to first excited state: 2,1,1.

To get to second excited state: maybe promoting one more particle. So from the first excited state, if we can promote another particle. But we only have four total. Already, two are in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. If we promote the particle in n=2 to n=4, then 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3,1 in n=4. Total energy 2 +0 +9 + 16=27E. Alternatively, promoting the particle in n=3 to n=4, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps another configuration.

Wait, maybe a different configuration. For example, 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3. Total energy 1 +8 +9=18E. Is that possible? For four particles: 1 +2 + 1 so sum to 4. But in this case, you have, in n=1: 1 particle (spin up), n=2: 2 particles (but can n=2 have two, even if the spins are up or down? Wait, two particles in n=2 is allowed, two in spin. Then if we have one particle in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3.

Wait, isn't that possible? Let's see: how many total? 1+2+1=4. Is this allowed? n=1 has one particle, which can be spin up or down. n=2 has two (must be spin up and down). n=3 has one (either spin). Then, according to Pauli, this is allowed because each spatial level can have two particles. So in n=1, you have just 1 (but which spin? Doesn't matter). n=2 has two (full), n=3 has one.

Compare this configuration with the previous 2 in n=1,1 in n=2,1 in n=3 (total 15E) versus this configuration now which sums to higher energy (18E). But we were supposed to find the first excited state (15E) and second excited state (he should have second excited higher than first). So 18E would be next. However, does another configuration result in a lower energy?

Alternatively, perhaps promoting both particles from n=2 in the ground state to n=3. So if in ground state, two in n=1 and two in n=2. Then, if you promote two particles from n=2 to n=3? So you would have two in n=1 and two in n=3. Then the total energy would be 2E + 18E =20E. Which is higher than 18E. So 18E might be second excited.

Wait, but the path to reach there is perhaps the first excited is 15E, then the next excited is by promoting another particle. But once you have already one particle in n=3 in the first excited state, promoting another either from n=1 or n=2 or the existing n=3? Hmm.

Actually, maybe multiple distinct configurations can lead to different energy levels. For four particles, the possible configurations (without considering spin, but spin is only there to help Pauli exclusion) arranged by filling...

Wait no, since the particles are spin-1/2, you have to include the spin as part of the state. But in this case, we are considering spatial orbitals here.

So, n=1 with two particles (spin-up and down), n=2 with two particles, similar, etc.

So, to have a configuration where one particle is in n=3. The first excited is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2,1 in n=3. So next, is the next excited state having...moving someone from n=2 to n=4? Then 2 in n=1,0 in n=2,1 in n=3,1 in n=4 (total energy 2 +0 +9 +16=27E). Alternatively, moving one from n=1 to n=3, giving 1 in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. Which is 1 +8 +9=18E. Alternatively, moving one from n=1 to n=2, but n=2 is full in ground state. So you can't.

Wait, but in the ground state, n=1 and n=2 are both filled. To excite, you have to promote from higher filled or something else.

Wait, but you can't take particles from n=1 unless n=2 is filled.

Wait, actually, no. Pauli's exclusion says that you can't have two particles in the same quantum state, i.e., same spatial orbital and same spin. But if you take a particle from n=1 and put it into a higher orbital n, then the spin is still opposite. Is that allowed? For example, say you have particles in n=1 spin up and down, n=2 spin up and down. That's four particles. To promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. Then n=1 would have one particle left, and n=3 has one. So the spin of the particle in n=3 can be either up or down. Wait, but is such a promotion allowed? So energy-wise, it's possible but is there a higher energy requirement to take a particle from lower n?

But moving a particle from n=1 (E) to n=3 (9E) would take more energy (8E) compared to moving a particle from n=2 (4E) to n=3 (9E), which is 5E. Therefore, I think the first excited state is moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (cost: 5E) rather than moving from n=1 to n=3 (cost:8E). So lower energy.

Thus, the configuration where a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3 is lower in energy than promoting from n=1.

Therefore, the first excited state is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2,1 in n=3 (15E). Then, moving another particle from n=2 to n=4 would not cost more (from 4 to 16, cost 12E). So 2 in n=1,0 in n=2,1 in n=3,1 in n=4. Which is 2E + 0E +9E +16E=27E. But if instead we can choose to promote one from n=1 instead. 

Wait but maybe another approach. If we have two possible states for the second excited state: either the 2 in n=1,0 in n=2,2 in n=3 (=20E), or the 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3 (=18E). Between 18E and 20E, the 18E is lower. Therefore, that would be the second excited state.

But how can we get the 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3 configuration? Because in that case, to promote one from n=1 to n=2? But in ground state, n=2 is fully filled. So how do you promote a particle from n=1 to n=2 if n=2 is already full. Wait, but in the ground state, n=2 is already filled with 2 particles. Then promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2 is not possible since that would result in 3 particles in n=2 if you already had two. Therefore, that configuration is impossible. So 1,2,1 is impossible because the n=2 state would have three particles? No, since in this configuration, would it be 2 or is it?

Wait, spin comes into play. The spatial orbital n=2 can hold 2 particles. So if I have 2 in n=1 (ground state configuration), and then promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (even though that’s higher in energy). But if we do that, so that would give 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. But let me check. Wait, we're starting from the ground state of 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. So if we promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, then n=1 would decrease from 2 to 1, n=3 would increase from 0 to1. So total particles: 1 +2 +1=4. But why would n=2 remain at 2? It's already filled. So is the 1, 2,1 configuration allowed?

Wait, no. When you promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, you aren't affecting n=2. So prior, n=2 had two particles. Promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 would only lower n=1 by 1 and raise n=3 by1, keeping n=2 at the same 2, but energy as 1 + 8 +9=18E? No!, if you promote from n=1 to n=3 leaving n=2 as is, total number of particles in n=2 is still 2, n=1 is 1, n=3 is 1, total 1+2 +1=4 particles. Wait, but that is possible. 

Wait, but then how is that done? The particles are fermions. So in the ground state, you have 2 in n=1 (spin up and down), 2 in n=2 (spin up and down). If you want to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, then you need to remove one from n=1 and place it in n=3. So n=1 would go from 2 to 1, n=3 goes from 0 to1. 

But when you do that, what happens to the spin? If you take, say, a spin-down from n=1 and promote it to n=3. So now, n=1 has only spin-up, and n=3 has spin-down or whatever. But Pauli exclusion only disallows two particles in the same spatial orbital with same spin. So n=3 is empty initially. So moving a particle there with any spin is allowed. So that configuration is allowed. Then, the total energy would be 1*1E+2*4E +1*9E=1 +8 +9 =18E.

But in this case, 18E is higher than 15E which came from the configuration promoting from n=2:2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2,1 in n=3 (total 15E). So 15E lower than 18E.

Therefore, there are two possible configurations after ground state.

Which means that the first excited state is 15E, then promoting another particle can lead to a higher energy. But if there's a way to get 18E, that would be another excitation. So maybe 15E and 18E are the first and second excited states? Or perhaps I need to check ordering.

So let's think in terms of promoting one or two particles. The first promotion is from n=2 ->n=3: since the energy required (change from 4E to 9E, which is an increase of 5E) is smaller than promoting from n=1 to n=2 (energy difference 3E, but n=2 is filled). Wait, Pauli does not allow that.

Alternatively,n=1 and n=2 are full. Then other configurations need to be formed by particles going into higher n. So in that case, initial ground state is 2,2.

First excited (lowest possible excited) would be 2,1,1 as say n=1 (2 particles),n=2(1 particles),n=3(1 particles). Total energy 15E.

Then for second excited state, possibilities: either:

a) Promoting another particle from n=2 to n=4. So n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:1, n=4:1. Energy:2+0+9+16=27E.

But wait, allows that because you can't have three in n=2.

Alternatively,

b) Promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 (energy: 8E vs move from n=2 to 3: 5E increase) From n=1 (1E) to n=3 energy difference is 8E. Which causes a big jump, larger than moving an existing in n=2. But but then configuration would be 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. energy=1+8 +9=18E.

Alternatively,

c) Promoting a particle from n=1 to n=4. Which is 1 to 16, so 15E difference, which gives 2 in n=1,2(2 particles in n=1 have to remove one and place in n=4: seems like each is possible. Putting one in n=4 would give energy increased by 15E. So 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=4 (total energy 1 + 8 + 16=25). Hmm, which is higher than 18E. So 18E is lower. So Second excited state could be 18E.

Then comes if 15E (first), 18E(second), and 20E(thirds).

Wait, could there be possibility of third excited state as different configurations?

Alternatively, you can have different excited states with different promotions. For example, promoting 2 particles:total n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2, gives energy 2E +0 +18E=20E, which would be when moving two particles from n=2 to n=3.

But to move two, one after another. When you move first particle, you get the 15E, then moving the second particle gives you 20E. Hence, perhaps preceding maybe the 18E or not?

But since moving two particles would require first moving one (15E) and then moving second, so each would be a different excited state. Therefore, 15E,18E,20E in order assuming 15 lowest then 18, then 20. But 18 is less than 20.

I think the order would be:

Ground state:10E (1s^2 2s^2).

First excited: 1s^2 2s^1 3s^1 (15E), second excited: 1s^1 2s^2 3s^1 (18E), then third is 1s^2 2s^0 3s^2 (20E), then 1s^2 2s^1 4s^1 (15 +12=27 ?). So that seems likely.

But maybe between these, there are other excitations, but based on increasing energies, the next lowest after 15E is 18E, then 20E.

Thus, answer would be Ground state:10E, first excited state:15E, second excited state:18E.

Alternatively, could there a configuration with 1 in 1,1 in2, 2 in3, but that's also 1+4 +16(?) Better sum that: 1

Wait, no. each level n contributes n^2.

So n=3 is 9E. So 1(E) +4(E) + 2*9(E)=1 +4 +18=23E. Which is higher than 20E.

Alternatively 1 in higher. So Hmm.

Therefore, the possible excited states:

After ground state 10E (n=1:2, n=2:2), then first promoting the two particles in n=2 to n=3 would give total energy 2E +0 + 9E x2=20E. But that skips the first excited state. Hence, steps:

Possible to promote one from n=2 to n=3 (15E), which cost +5E

If you promote another from n=2 to n=3 (now total two in n=3), but then the second promotion would cost as well, giving increase by +5E again.

Wait, if n=3 can have two particles, sum E increases from 9 to 2*9.

But in first excited state, you have 1 in n=3. Promoting another particle from n=2 to n=3 (going to0 in n=2), the total energy would be 2E +0 +2 *9E=20E.

But that's another of 20E which would the  higher than 15E but is it higher than 18E. So between 15E, leading to 20E if same promotion.

However,the alternative way unless you can get lower, which is promoting one from n=1. If you go from 2 in n=1->1 in n=1, moving one up to n=3. so promoting one from n=1 to n=3.  Which costs 8E. Therefore, such configuration as 1 +... arrives higher energy than the other ways. So hence, the 15E->18E->20E would occur.

Therefore the first excited state is 15E, second is 18E, and third is20E. So for the problem stated, requesting for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. So answers should be 10E,15E,18E.

Therefore, summarizing:

Ground state: n=1 and n=2 each filled with 2; total = 2*E + 2*4E=10E

First excited: n=1 filled (2 particles), n=2 (1), n=3 (1); total=2E +4E +9E=15E

Second excited: remaining particle in n=1 filled (1), n=2 filled (2), and n=3 (1); total=E +2*4E +9E=1 +8 +9=18E

Thus grounding the result. Answer should be written in terms of E. Therefore:

Ground state:10E, first excited:15E, second excited:18E.

But hold on, I should check if someone has the same energy of 18E but through different configurations, perhaps contributing the same but due to degenerate states.

Wait, different configurations could possibly give the same energy? For example, if you have the same total energy with different quantum numbers. For example, n1=1, n2=2, n3=3, n4=3. But each spatial orbital takes two. But for four particles, two fill n=1 and n=2 in ground state.

Wait, for excited stated, the spatial orbitals allow some combinations. But things like particles in n=1:2 and n=2:2 is the same as ground state.

But For example, another possible excited state for second where promote two particles from n=2 to n=3 with different configurations? But this would give the same as the configuration of first excited: but multiple possibilities?

But no, parity of configuration. Wait, spin in different directions?

Wait, maybe some degeneracy. So for two particles with different spins, perhaps there are different states but same energy. However, since in 1D, spatial energy is characterized only by "n", so same n same energy. Pauli excluded by spin. So wavefunction for spatial parts with distinct n along with permuted spins would lead to same total energy.

But I think, for many-body systems, the configuration is characterized only by the occupation numbers (number of Spin-Up/Spin-down in each n). But if the same orbitals are filled, even with spin changed, but spatial it's same, so their energy is degenerate. 

But different occupation numbers in terms of n's get them different energies.

Hence, the key is the sum of n_i^2 for each particles. Each non-interacting.

Thus, yes, in the non-interacting case, the total energy is sum over individual energies. Therefore, different configurations where different n are filled by different numbers of particles will contribute different total energy. Exactly as we calculated.

Therefore, if all four particles are in n=1 and n=2, then 10E. When one is promoted to n=3, sum to 15E. When one is promoted from n=1 to n=3 (E vs 9E, energy cost 8E compared to ground state) 18E. Therefore, possible excited states only when you move from lower n to higher n according to fermionic exclusion. Hence, other excitation steps.

But it's important to check why the second excited state is 18E not 20E.

Because there's a different way to arrange it, but with lower energy.

Therefore according to these calculations, the answer is 10,15,18. but let me check samples online.

Wait, different examples. For example, if three particles in 1D box.

Ground state:2 in n=1 and 1 in n=2, But with 4 particles, n=1 =2 and n=2=2. To reach first excited state, you can promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So total energy is 2 +1*4 +1*9=15. Then to get second excited state, probably elevating from n=1 ->n=3 (making 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3:1 +8 +9=18E).

Yes, exactly, which is corresponding to my calculation. Hence, the answer: Ground state:10E, first excited:15E, second excited:18E.

But a person might otherwise think if you promote both particles from n=2 to n=3 and get energy at20E for second excited state, but that would be less than the perhaps higher in energy. But 18E is prior. 18E is lower than 20E.

Thus so therefore logic follows.

Final conclusion; ground state:10E, first:15E, second:18E.

**Final Answer**
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \boxed{10E}, \boxed{15E}, and \boxed{18E} respectively.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy levels for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The particles are fermions since they have spin-1/2, right? So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which means each quantum state can be occupied by at most two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down). 

The well is one-dimensional, so the single-particle energy levels are given by E_n = n²E, where E is the unit energy defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²). Each energy level n can hold two electrons due to their spin. So the problem is about filling up these energy levels with four particles while obeying the Pauli exclusion principle and then finding the total energy for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Let me recall. For a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are non-degenerate except for the spin degeneracy. So each spatial orbital (each n) can hold two fermions. So first, for the ground state, we need to fill the lowest energy levels first.

Let's tabulate the energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = 1² E = E, holds 2 particles

n=2: E_2 = 4E, holds 2 particles

n=3: E_3 = 9E, holds 2 particles

Wait, but with four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) can hold 2 + 2 = 4 particles. That fills up n=1 and n=2. So the ground state would have all four particles in n=1 and n=2. Then the total energy would be 2*E + 2*4E = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but hold on, each energy level n can hold two particles. So if you have four particles, the lowest two levels will be filled in the ground state. So all four particles are in n=1 and n=2, two each.

But is that correct? Let me check again. For each n, two particles (spin up and down). So the first level (n=1) can hold two, then the next, n=2, can hold another two. Thus, n=1 and n=2 are filled. Then total energy is 2*E + 2*4E = 2E + 8E = 10E. So that would be the ground state.

Now, for the first excited state. The first excited state is the next lowest energy configuration. So what would that be? Instead of having both particles in n=2, maybe one is promoted to the next level.

But wait, with four particles, the ground state has two in n=1 and two in n=2. If we need to create an excited state, we need to promote one of the particles from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). So instead of having two particles in n=2, you have one in n=2 and one in n=3. Then the configuration would be 2 (n=1) + 1 (n=2) + 1 (n=3). But wait, with spin, is that allowed?

But wait, each spatial level can hold two particles. If you have only one particle in n=2, that's okay; same for n=3. So then you have: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy would be 2E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

But wait, is that the first excited state? Or is there another configuration with a lower energy than 15E? Let me see. Let's think of alternative configurations. For four particles, other possibilities to distribute the particles.

Alternatively, if instead we have three particles in lower levels? But how. For example, suppose you have two in n=1, and two in n=3. But why would we skip n=2? You can't, because you need to fill the lowest energy levels first. But in the ground state, you already filled n=1 and n=2.

In an excited state, maybe you can have some particles in higher levels. But without violating Pauli? Let me recap. For fermions, each spatial orbital can have a maximum of two (spin up and down). So the ground state has two in n=1, two in n=2. First excited state would be to take one particle from n=2 and put it into n=3, leading to two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

But maybe there is a different configuration where instead two particles are in higher orbitals with lower total energy. Wait, but higher orbitals have higher energy, so moving particles to higher orbitals will only increase the total energy. However, maybe distributing them differently could lead to lower total energy increase. For example, if instead some particles are moved to higher orbitals but not all possible.

Wait, is there a way of placing three particles in the same level? But no, since Pauli allows only two per level. Therefore, you can't have three in n=1 and one in n=2. So each level can only have 0,1, or 2 particles.

So the possible configurations for four particles:

1. 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2: total energy 2*1E + 2*4E= 10E (ground state)

2. 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3: total energy 2*1E +1*4E +1*9E=15E (first excited state?)

3. 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3: total energy 2*1E + 2*9E=20E

Alternatively, maybe 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Total energy 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9=1 +8 +9=18E. But this is higher than 15E, so 15E would be lower. But is configuration 2 allowed?

Wait, to go from the ground state (2,2,0,...) to (2,1,1,...), that would require promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3. Since all the particles are identical fermions, they need to have different quantum states. When you promote one particle from n=2 (which had two particles before) to n=3 (which can take two), but now if n=3 is empty, we can put one in there. Then the configuration 2 in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Each with two spins. Now, does that obey the Pauli exclusion principle? Yes, because each spatial level can have up to two, so in this case, n=1 has two, n=2 has one (but since spin can be up or down, why cannot it have two?), ah, hold on. Why do n=2 have only one in the first excited state? Wait, spin is 1/2, which gives two possible states per spatial orbital. If the spatial orbital for n=2 has two particles (spin up and down), and n=3 has two slots, but if you promote one particle from n=2 to n=3, then n=2 would have one particle, and n=3 would have one particle. So both n=2 and n=3 would have one particle each. Wait, but is that correct? Wait, if you have only one particle in n=2, how is that possible?

Wait, each spatial orbital can have two particles. So if you have two particles in n=1 (full), then for the next two particles, in higher orbitals. If you promote a particle, actually in the ground state, particles are filled as: two in n=1 (spin up and down), two in n=2 (spin up and down). To get the first excited state, you need to promote one particle from n=2 to the next avail

I need to determine the energy levels for four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Since these are fermions with spin-1/2, they must follow the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning each quantum state can hold at most two particles (one spin up, one spin down).

In a one-dimensional infinite well, the single-particle energy levels follow E_n = n²E, where E equals π²ħ²/(2mL²). Due to spin, each energy level n can accommodate two fermions. My task is to find the total energy for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state while respecting the Pauli principle.

For a 1D infinite potential well, energy levels are non-degenerate except for spin degeneracy, allowing two fermions per spatial orbital. Let me examine the available energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = E, can hold 2 particles
n=2: E_2 = 4E, can hold 2 particles
n=3: E_3 = 9E, can hold 2 particles

With four particles total, the ground state would fill the lowest available levels first. This means two particles in n=1 and two particles in n=2. The total ground state energy would be 2*E + 2*4E = 2E + 8E = 10E.

For the first excited state, I need to consider the next lowest energy configuration. Starting from the ground state, I would promote one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). This gives a configuration of two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The total energy would be 2E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

Let me verify this is indeed the first excited state by considering other possible configurations:

1. Ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → total energy = 10E
2. Possible first excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → total energy = 15E
3. Another configuration: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → total energy = 20E
4. Alternative configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → total energy = 18E

Since configuration 2 has the lowest energy among all possible excited states (15E), it must be the first excited state. Each configuration respects the Pauli exclusion principle since no energy level contains more than two particles.

Alright, I need to determine the energy levels for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. These particles are fermions due to their spin-1/2, which means they follow the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle permits each quantum state to be occupied by a maximum of two particles (one with spin up and another with spin down). 

Given that the well is one-dimensional, the single-particle energy levels are expressed as E_n = n²E, where E represents the unit energy, defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²). Because of their spin, each energy level n can accommodate two electrons. Therefore, the task is to fill these energy levels with four particles while adhering to the Pauli exclusion principle and then compute the total energy for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Let me review. For a 1D infinite potential well, energy levels are non-degenerate except for spin degeneracy. Thus, each spatial orbital (each n) can house two fermions. To start, for the ground state, we need to fill the lowest energy levels first.

Let's outline the energy levels:

n=1: E_1 = 1²E = E, accommodates 2 particles

n=2: E_2 = 4E, accommodates 2 particles

n=3: E_3 = 9E, accommodates 2 particles

But, with four particles, the initial two levels (n=1 and n=2) can hold 2 + 2 = 4 particles total. That populates n=1 and n=2. Consequently, the ground state consists of all four particles in n=1 and n=2. Therefore, the total energy is 2E + 2*4E = 2E + 8E = 10E.

However, let's verify. Each energy level n can hold two particles. With four particles, the ground state fully occupies the lowest two levels. Thus, all four particles reside in n=1 and n=2, two each.

Is that correct? Let me confirm. For each n, there are two particles (spin up and down). So, the initial level (n=1) can contain two, followed by n=2, with another two. Thus, n=1 and n=2 are filled. As a result, the total energy is 2E + 2*4E = 2E + 8E = 10E. This configuration represents the ground state.

For the first excited state, it's the succeeding lowest energy configuration. What would that be? Perhaps instead of both particles in n=2, one is elevated to the next level.

However, with four particles, the ground state includes two in n=1 and two in n=2. To form an excited state, a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) needs to be elevated to the subsequent available level (n=3). In this case, rather than having two particles in n=2, one would be in n=2, and one in n=3. So, the configuration becomes 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. Is that allowable with spin?

Each spatial level can accommodate two particles. If there's just one particle in n=2, that's permissible; similarly for n=3. So, you have: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The total energy is 2E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

Is this the first excited state, or could there be another configuration with lower energy than 15E? Let's explore alternative configurations for distributing the four particles.

Alternatively, what if there are three particles in lower levels? For instance, two in n=1, and two in n=3. Yet, why bypass n=2? That's not feasible as the lowest energy levels need to be filled first. But in the ground state, n=1 and n=2 are already occupied.

In an excited state, some particles can be in elevated levels. But how without breaching Pauli? Let's recap. For fermions, each spatial orbital can house a maximum of two (spin up and down). The ground state comprises two in n=1, two in n=2. The first excited state involves elevating a particle from n=2 to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.

However, could there be another configuration with two particles at higher orbitals with a lesser energy increase? Higher orbitals inherently possess greater energy, but distributing them differently might result in a lesser total energy increase. Suppose instead some individuals relocate to higher orbitals.

Placing three particles in the same level? No, Pauli permits only two per level. Thus, n=1 cannot house three alongside one in n=2. Each level can comprise only 0, 1, or 2 particles.

Therefore, possible configurations for four particles are:

1. Two in n=1, two in n=2: total energy 2*E + 2*4E = 10E (ground state)

2. Two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3: total energy 2*E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 15E (first excited state?)

3. Two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3: total energy 2*E + 2*9E = 20E

Alternatively, one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. Total energy 1*E + 2*4E + 1*9E = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E. Nonetheless, this is higher than 15E, confirming 15E as lower. But is configuration 2 valid?

To transition from the ground state (2,2,0,...) to (2,1,1,...), it entails elevating one particle from n=2 to n=3. Identical fermions require unique quantum states. Promoting one from n=2 (previously two particles) to n=3 (accommodating two) is feasible if n=3 is unoccupied. Thus, the configuration comprises two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Each with two spins. Does this adhere to the Pauli exclusion principle? Yes, given each spatial level may house up to two, thus n=1 has two, n=2 and n=3 one each. However, why does n=2 only have one in the first excited state? Given spin 1/2, each spatial orbital allows two states. If the spatial orbital for n=2 has two particles (spin up and down) and n=3 accommodates two particles, transferring one particle from n=2 to n=3 leaves one in n=2 and one in n=3. Correct? If there's only one in n=2, how?

Each spatial orbital can possess two particles. Thus, two particles in n=1 (full), with the subsequent two particles in higher orbitals. To reach the first excited state, a particle must be elevated from n=2 to the next available level.

Since n=3 is the next. So instead of having two in n=2, we have one in n=2 and one in n=3. But in this case, how does the spin work? In n=2, now there's only one particle. So spin can be either up or down, doesn't matter. Then in n=3, we have one particle. The same spin? Or different? No, spin can be arbitrary, but two particles can have the same spin if they are in different spatial orbitals. Wait, right. The Pauli exclusion principle applies to the same spatial orbital. So if two particles are in different spatial orbitals, they can have the same spin. Therefore, in the configuration of 2,1,1: so two in n=1 (spin up and down), and in n=2, one particle (let's say spin up), and in n=3, one particle (spin up). Is that allowed? Yes, because they are in different spatial orbitals.\n\nHence, this configuration is allowed and has total energy 15E.\n\nBut let's check if there's a configuration between 10E and 15E. For instance, suppose we have promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2. But no, n=2 is already full in the ground state. So you can't promote from n=1 to n=2 because n=2 already has two particles. Therefore, the next available orbital is n=3. Hence, you have to promote one particle from n=2 to n=3, leading to 15E.\n\nTherefore, the first excited state is 15E.\n\nThen the second excited state would be the next higher energy configuration. What comes next? Let's see. Possible configurations with four particles are:\n\nAfter (2,1,1) with 15E, the next could be:\n\n2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3: total energy 2*1 + 2*9 = 20E.\n\nAnother possibility is: maybe 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Which would have energy 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9=1 +8 +9=18E. Is that allowed?\n\nLet's see. To get this configuration, you would need to have one particle in n=1, but the Pauli principle allows two. Wait, but in that case, you can't have one in n=1 and two in n=2. Wait, if you start from the ground state (2,2,0), if you promote one particle from n=1 to n=2, but n=2 is already full (two particles). Therefore, that's not possible. Therefore, such a configuration isn't allowed.\n\nWait, no. n=1 has two, to promote one from n=1 to n=3, leading to 1 in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. But if you take one from n=1, then n=1 would have one particle left, which is allowed. Then if you add that particle to n=3, then:\n\nTotal configuration: 1 (n=1) +2 (n=2) +1 (n=3). But here, is the spatial orbital n=3 only holding one particle? Yes. But why can't n=2 have three particles? But no, n=2 can hold two at maximum. Since n=2 is allowed to have two, as per spin.\n\nWait, if originally we had two in n=1 and two in n=2. If we take one out from n=1 and put it into n=3, then n=1 has one particle left (spin up, say), n=2 still has two, and n=3 has one. Is this configuration possible?\n\nYes, because n=2 was already filled with two particles, you can't add any more, but you can leave it as two. Wait, but we are promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3. But n=3 can take two particles. So putting the promoted particle into n=3, leaving n=1 with one. This results in energy 1*1 +2*4 +1*9=18E. This configuration is possible.\n\nBut is this configuration lower in energy than 20E? Yes. 18E is lower than 20E, so 18E would be after 15E? Or is there a way that a configuration even in between 15E and 18E?\n\nWait, another possible arrangement: After the first excited state (2,1,1,0), which is 15E, the next could be.\n\nIf we take another particle from n=2 to n=3, leading to 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. But that would require 2+0+2=4 particles, which is 20E. So that is a higher energy.\n\nAlternatively, is it possible to have one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3? That would require 1+1+2=4, but n=3 can take two particles. But wait, that's legal. So that would lead to 1*1 +1*4 +2*9=1 +4 +18=23E. Which is higher than 20E.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can think of other configurations.\n\nWait, but maybe instead of taking one from n=2, taking one from n=1.\n\nIf the ground state is (2,2,0,...), promoting one from n=1 to n=3. Configuration (1,2,1): 1*1 +2*4 +1*9=1+8+9=18E. Compared to promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3, but you can’t, because you only have two in n=2, so promoting both would leave (2,0,2), 2+0+2=4 particles.\n\nSo configuration (2,0,2) is 20E, which is higher than (1,2,1) at 18E. Therefore, 18E would be lower. Therefore, sequence goes ground:10E, first excited:15E, second excited:18E.\n\nBut wait, does the configuration (1,2,1) with energy 18E have lower energy than the (2,1,1) which is 15E? No. 15<18. So wait, so the first excited state is 15E, then promoting a second particle from n=2 to n=3 gives (2,0,2)=20E. Alternatively, promoting a different particle?\n\nAlternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=4? Then 1,2,1,1. But n=1 has one, n=2 two, n=4 one. The energy here would be 1*1 +2*4 +1*16=1 +8 +16=25E. Higher than 20E.\n\nSo perhaps the order is:\n\nGround:10E.\n\nFirst excited:15E.\n\nSecond excited:18E.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the first excited is (2,1,1). To get the second excited, either promoting again or jumping more.\n\nWait, perhaps promoting from n=3 to n=4, but that would result in even higher energy.\n\nWait, maybe another type of configuration. Suppose instead of promoting one particle from n=2, you promote a particle from n=1?\n\nFor example, take one particle from n=1 to n=3. Then you have 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3: 18E. So that's 1+8+9=18.\n\nBut to do that, you have to promote a particle over the n=2 level, which was already full.\n\nWait, why not? In the ground state, n=1 is filled with two and n=2 as well. If you promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, you have to leave one in n=1, and put one in n=3. However, n=2 is still filled with two. Thus, energy of 1*1 +2*4 +1*9=18E.\n\nBut in terms of energy, which is lower: the configuration (2,1,1) vs (1,2,1). The (2,1,1) is 15E vs (1,2,1) is 18E. So (2,1,1) comes before.\n\nSo Order:\n\n1. (2,2,0) 10E (Ground state)\n\n2. (2,1,1) 15E (First excited state)\n\n3. (1,2,1) 18E (Second excited state)\n\nBut is (1,2,1) a valid excited state?\n\nIn the ground state, all lowest orbitals are filled. To get to (1,2,1), you have to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. However, promoting a particle from n=1 (which is lower in energy) to n=3 (which is higher) would result in a lower energy cost than promoting from n=2 to n=3? Wait, no. Let's think.\n\nThe energy difference to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3 is E_3 - E_1 =9E -1E=8E.\n\nWhereas promoting from n=2 to n=3 is E_3-E_2=9E -4E=5E. So the latter is a lower energy difference. Thus, it is energetically more favorable to promote from n=2 to n=3 (to get the first excited state), since that only requires 5E instead of 8E.\n\nThus, the list of configurations in order of increasing energy:\n\n1. (2,2,0) 10E (Ground state)\n\n2. (2,1,1) 15E (First excited state)\n\n3. (1,2,1) 18E (Second excited state)\n\nThen followed by (2,0,2) at 20E, etc.\n\nBut here is the confusion: which configuration comes first: promoting one from n=1 or another from n=2?\n\nSince promoting one from n=2 takes less energy (cost 5E), which gives 15E, but promoting one from n=1 costs more (8E, leading from 10E to 18E). So first excited state is 15E, next would be 18E, then 20E. So the energies in order are 10E,15E,18E,20E,...\n\nTherefore, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another possible arrangement where you have three particles in higher orbitals but still compromising the total energy.\n\nWait, let's make a table of configurations and energies:\n\n1. (2,2,0,0,...): 10E (Ground state)\n\n2. (2,1,1,0,...):15E\n\n3. (1,2,1,0,...):18E\n\n4. (2,0,2,0,...):20E\n\n5. (1,1,2,0,...):1 +4 +18=23E\n\n6. (0,2,2,0,...):0 +8 +18=26E\n\nEtc.\n\nSo the next possible states after 18E would be 20E. So in energy order:10,15,18,20,...\n\nHence, ground, first excited, second excited. So in that case, the answer would be Ground:10E, First excited:15E, Second excited:18E.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there another configuration that might lie between 15E and 18E which I haven't considered?\n\nLet's see. Suppose instead promoting two particles from higher to lower but Pauli allows.\n\nBut once particles are in n=1 and n=2, can't get them lower. Alternatively, in some ways, combining a promotion from both n=1 and n=2? For example, promoting one from n=1 to n=2 and another from something? Wait, but n=2 can only hold two. Hence, can't. There's no way to have other configurations that could be lower than 15E except Ground state.\n\nAlternatively, is this an alternative where n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=3 has one and another in n=4? Wait, but with four particles. No, (2,1,1,0) has four. So can’t go further.\n\nWait, when I mentioned configuration (1,2,1,0): 1+2+1=4.\n\nWait, actually, configuration (n1=1, n2=2, n3=1, n4=0) has four particles: two in n=2.\n\nBut no. Wait: Confused. Wait, for each n, the number of particles. n=1:1 particle, n=2:2 particles, n=3:1 particle. But since each n can hold two particles. E.g., n=2 can hold two, which is fine. However, how does this configuration come about?\n\nIn 1,2,1 configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3. So 1 +2 +1=4 particles. To reach this state from the ground state, we have to promote one from n=1 to n=3. But what would be the energy needed? The promotion is E=9E -1E=8E. Whereas moving from n=2 to n=3:9E-4E=5E. Therefore, the first excited is 15E (only 5E in promotion), then promoting from another one (from n=2 to n=4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if we could have a combination of promoting two particles: one from n=2 to n=3 (cost 5E) and another from n=1 to n=2. Wait, but n=2 is already full. No space in n=2.\n\nAlternatively, it may not be possible. So it's likely that the order as 10E,15E,18E,20E.\n\nSo based on this, the energies would be:\n\nGround state: 10E\n\nFirst excited state:15E\n\nSecond excited state:18E\n\nBut maybe not?\n\nWait, to verify, let me check the possible arrangements for the particles.\n\nGiven that the lowest energy configuration is filled as (2,2,0,...). The total energy is 2E +8E=10E. To reach the first excited state, the minimal energy increase would come from moving one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2 in this case) to the next available level (n=3). This leads to (2,1,1) with energy 2E +4E +9E=15E. Then, the next possible minimal energy increase would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but then n=2 has zero, leading to (2,0,2) which is 2E +0 +18E=20E. Alternatively, if you can move a different particle, from a lower level. Since the next available higher level is relatively higher, the promotion comes with a larger energy cost.\n\nAlternatively, can one spin up be promoted to a higher level while leaving a lower level still half-filled?\n\nAlternatively, another strategy is to think of the possible configurations and arrange them by their total energies.\n\nLooking at configurations:\n\n1. (2,2,0) - 10E: Ground state\n\n2. (2,1,1) - 15E\n\n3. (1,2,1) -18E\n\n4. (2,0,2) -20E\n\n5. (1,1,2) -23E\n\n6. (0,2,2) -26E\n\nAdditionally, there are other possible ways if we start putting particles in n=4. For example, (2,1,0,1) but that would have energy 2*1 +1*4 +1*16=2+4+16=22E. Hmm, so 22E is between 20E and 23E.\n\nWait, (2,1,0,1): two in n=1, one in n=2, none in n=3, one in n=4. So 2 +4 +0 +16=22E. So that's another possible state. Then that would be, energy-wise, between (1,2,1) 18E and (2,0,2) 20E and (2,1,0,1) 22E. Wait, but no: 18E, 20E,22E. So actually, the system could go to lower energy if after 15E, sometimes spreading out particles across other orbitals?\n\nWait, but how is the ordering here?\n\nSuppose we have Ground State (2,2,0):10E.\n\nFirst excited: (2,1,1):15E.\n\nThen, next get excited either by putting another in n=3 (from n=2 to n=3:(2,0,2):20E ) or promote from lower n to higher.\n\nBut instead of putting two in n=3, maybe putting one in n=4. So from n=2 to n=4: One in n=4. So let's see. Suppose (2,1,0,1): So moving one from n=3 (which we had one) to n=4? Wait, original configuration after first excited state: (2,1,1). To make (2,1,0,1), you promote from n=3 to n=4. Which would be a lower cost? The energy cost is E4 - E3=16E-9E=7E. Compared to promoting from n=2: That would be E4 -E2=16E -4E=12E. So promoting an already excited particle (in n=3) to go to n=4 for only 7E. But wait, starting from (2,1,1), you can promote the particle in n=3 to n=4, resulting in (2,1,0,1) with energy 2E +4E +0 +16E=22E. But if we first have (2,1,1)=15E, to get to (2,1,0,1)=22E, but also doing that would be cost 7E.\n\nAlternatively, if from GS (10E) you promote a second particle: like but that requires an energy.\n\nAlternatively, states like (1,1,1,1), but with all four particles in different n's? But each n can hold two. So the configuration (1,1,1,1) is possible (each n from 1 to4 one particles). The total energy would be 1 +4 +9 +16=30E, which is much higher.\n\nTherefore, is 18E ->(1,2,1) or 20E, or 22E next? The previous analysis on energy levels would lead moving a particle from lower or higher states.\n\nWait, but in (2,1,1) is the highest level in n=3. If the system is in the (2,1,1) configuration and you can promote any existing electron. Since electrons are in n=1 (filled), n=2 (half-filled), and n=3 (half-filled). Now, the possible promotions would be from lowest energy states to higher, but the highest electron that can be promoted at the lowest cost would be the one in n=3. For example.\n\nBut promoting from n=1 (lowest) would jump two levels to n=3 (from price 8E) while promoting from n=3 to n=4 is a 7E. So cost 7E. But having the four particles:\n\nWait, let's clarify. The transitions between states. Suppose you want the possible excited states where only one particle is promoted from the ground state. But in this case, the next excited states may involve multiple promotions?\n\nBut the problem stipulates the second excited state. From ground state, which is first, after first excited state. But our analysis showed 15E, 18E, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the order is 10E,15E,18E, which corresponds to the next minimal energy steps. So maybe the decreasing order is:\n\nGround state:10,\n\nFirst excited:15,\n\nSecond excited:18,\n\nThird excited:20,\n\nand so on.\n\nBut to confirm this, perhaps we can observe the energy orderings of possible configurations and their total energies:\n\n(2,2,0):10E\n\nMove one from n=2 to n=3: (2,1,1):15E\n\nMove the next from n=2 to n=3:(2,0,2):20E OR move one from n=1 to n=3: (1,2,1):18E OR move one from n=3 to n=4: (2,1,0,1):22E\n\nBut which of these transitions is lower in energy? Let's see:\n\nMoving the second particle from n=2 to n=3: gives (2,0,2) with energy increase to 20E. So requires cost (9E -4E)=5E again? Wait, no. If you have (2,1,1) as the previous state at 15E, promoting the second particle: (2,0,2) requires (+5E each), but n=2 to n=3. Wait actually the energy difference between the second and first excited states is:\n\nGround state:10E\n\nFirst excited:15E (10E +5E)\n\nSecond excited:20E (15E +5E). This is only if we follow the same pattern.\n\nBut in reality, from 15E, promoting from n=2 to n=3 would require 5E more: (2,0,2). But from (2,1,1), the next possible step might not be putting another into n=3 but moving a different particle.\n\nHowever, does the next higher energy state correspond to:\n\nOption 1: (1,2,1) with energy 1E +8E +9E=18E. So this state can be achieved by promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3. So this requires adding 8E compared to the ground state. Ground state is 10E. Hence, (1,2,1)=18E is +8E above ground, but compared to the first excited state at 15E, it is +3E higher. Similarly, moving a particle from n=3 to n=4 in the first excited state will yield 22E=15+7E. So which is better?\n\nWait, but here lies the problem: what tells us which comes first? Without calculating the state energies and then comparing them, but actually you need to think which is energetically higher.(18 is less than20 and also less than22? 18 is the next?)\n\nWait, compute total energies:\n\nAfter Ground 10E,\n\n- (2,1,1):15E,\n\n- (1,2,1):18E,\n\n- (2,0,2):20E,\n\n- (2,1,0,1):22E,\n\n- (1,1,1,1):30E,\n\nTherefore, in order:10,15,18,20,22,30,...\n\nTherefore, the three lowest energy states are:\n\n1. Ground state(2,2,0):10E\n\n2. First excited state(2,1,1):15E\n\n3. Second excited state(1,2,1):18E\n\nAnd the third excited state is (2,0,2) at20E, etc.\n\nTherefore, according to this, answer would require an ground state energy=10E, first excited=15E, second excited=18E.\n\nBut perhaps alternative reference?\n\nAlternatively, the measurement of excited states is not according to total energy but to the energy level above ground?\n\nNo, in general, excited states are ordered by their total energy. So the first excited state is the first higher energy than the ground state, the second excited state is the next, etc. So in our case, above 10E is 15E, next is18E.\n\nThus, ground state:10E, first excited:15E, second excited:18E.\n\nTherefore, this should be the answer. Thus, boxed answers:\n\nGround state: \\boxed{10E}\n\nFirst excited state: \\boxed{15E}\n\nSecond excited state: \\boxed{18E}\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy of the ground state is \\boxed{10E}, the first excited state is \\boxed{15E}, and the second excited state is \\boxed{18E}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743811882, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5875, prompt_tokens=1845, total_tokens=7720, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we need to consider the Pauli exclusion principle and the energy levels of the system. Each spatial orbital can hold at most two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down).

The energy levels for a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \).

### Ground State
For the ground state, we fill the lowest energy levels first:
- Two particles in \( n=1 \) (energy \( E_1 = E \))
- Two particles in \( n=2 \) (energy \( E_2 = 4E \))

Total energy of the ground state:
\[
2E + 2 \cdot 4E = 2E + 8E = 10E
\]

### First Excited State
The first excited state is obtained by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level ( \( n=2 \) ) to the next available level ( \( n=3 \) ):
- Two particles in \( n=1 \) (energy \( E_1 = E \))
- One particle in \( n=2 \) (energy \( E_2 = 4E \))
- One particle in \( n=3 \) (energy \( E_3 = 9E \))

Total energy of the first excited state:
\[
2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
\]

### Second Excited State
The second excited state is obtained by promoting another particle, this time from \( n=1 \) to \( n=3 \):
- One particle in \( n=1 \) (energy \( E_1 = E \))
- Two particles in \( n=2 \) (energy \( E_2 = 4E \))
- One particle in \( n=3 \) (energy \( E_3 = 9E \))

Total energy of the second excited state:
\[
E + 2 \cdot 4E + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E
\]

### Final Answer
The energy of the ground state is \(\boxed{10E}\), the first excited state is \(\boxed{15E}\), and the second excited state is \(\boxed{18E}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

abl eorbital. Since n=3 is the next. So instead of having two in n=2, we have one in n=2 and one in n=3. But in this case, how does the spin work? In n=2, now there's only one particle. So spin can be either up or down, doesn't matter. Then in n=3, we have one particle. The same spin? Or different? No, spin can be arbitrary, but two particles can have the same spin if they are in different spatial orbitals. Wait, right. The Pauli exclusion principle applies to the same spatial orbital. So if two particles are in different spatial orbitals, they can have the same spin. Therefore, in the configuration of 2,1,1: so two in n=1 (spin up and down), and in n=2, one particle (let's say spin up), and in n=3, one particle (spin up). Is that allowed? Yes, because they are in different spatial orbitals.

Hence, this configuration is allowed and has total energy 15E.

But let's check if there's a configuration between 10E and 15E. For instance, suppose we have promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2. But no, n=2 is already full in the ground state. So you can't promote from n=1 to n=2 because n=2 already has two particles. Therefore, the next available orbital is n=3. Hence, you have to promote one particle from n=2 to n=3, leading to 15E.

Therefore, the first excited state is 15E.

Then the second excited state would be the next higher energy configuration. What comes next? Let's see. Possible configurations with four particles are:

After (2,1,1) with 15E, the next could be:

2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3: total energy 2*1 + 2*9 = 20E.

Another possibility is: maybe 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Which would have energy 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9=1 +8 +9=18E. Is that allowed?

Let's see. To get this configuration, you would need to have one particle in n=1, but the Pauli principle allows two. Wait, but in that case, you can't have one in n=1 and two in n=2. Wait, if you start from the ground state (2,2,0), if you promote one particle from n=1 to n=2, but n=2 is already full (two particles). Therefore, that's not possible. Therefore, such a configuration isn't allowed.

Wait, no. n=1 has two, to promote one from n=1 to n=3, leading to 1 in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. But if you take one from n=1, then n=1 would have one particle left, which is allowed. Then if you add that particle to n=3, then:

Total configuration: 1 (n=1) +2 (n=2) +1 (n=3). But here, is the spatial orbital n=3 only holding one particle? Yes. But why can't n=2 have three particles? But no, n=2 can hold two at maximum. Since n=2 is allowed to have two, as per spin.

Wait, if originally we had two in n=1 and two in n=2. If we take one out from n=1 and put it into n=3, then n=1 has one particle left (spin up, say), n=2 still has two, and n=3 has one. Is this configuration possible?

Yes, because n=2 was already filled with two particles, you can't add any more, but you can leave it as two. Wait, but we are promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3. But n=3 can take two particles. So putting the promoted particle into n=3, leaving n=1 with one. This results in energy 1*1 +2*4 +1*9=18E. This configuration is possible.

But is this configuration lower in energy than 20E? Yes. 18E is lower than 20E, so 18E would be after 15E? Or is there a way that a configuration even in between 15E and 18E?

Wait, another possible arrangement: After the first excited state (2,1,1,0), which is 15E, the next could be.

If we take another particle from n=2 to n=3, leading to 2 particles in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. But that would require 2+0+2=4 particles, which is 20E. So that is a higher energy.

Alternatively, is it possible to have one in n=1, one in n=2, two in n=3? That would require 1+1+2=4, but n=3 can take two particles. But wait, that's legal. So that would lead to 1*1 +1*4 +2*9=1 +4 +18=23E. Which is higher than 20E.

Alternatively, let's see if we can think of other configurations.

Wait, but maybe instead of taking one from n=2, taking one from n=1.

If the ground state is (2,2,0,...), promoting one from n=1 to n=3. Configuration (1,2,1): 1*1 +2*4 +1*9=1+8+9=18E. Compared to promoting two particles from n=2 to n=3, but you can’t, because you only have two in n=2, so promoting both would leave (2,0,2), 2+0+2=4 particles.

So configuration (2,0,2) is 20E, which is higher than (1,2,1) at 18E. Therefore, 18E would be lower. Therefore, sequence goes ground:10E, first excited:15E, second excited:18E.

But wait, does the configuration (1,2,1) with energy 18E have lower energy than the (2,1,1) which is 15E? No. 15<18. So wait, so the first excited state is 15E, then promoting a second particle from n=2 to n=3 gives (2,0,2)=20E. Alternatively, promoting a different particle?

Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=4? Then 1,2,1,1. But n=1 has one, n=2 two, n=4 one. The energy here would be 1*1 +2*4 +1*16=1 +8 +16=25E. Higher than 20E.

So perhaps the order is:

Ground:10E.

First excited:15E.

Second excited:18E.

But how?

Wait, the first excited is (2,1,1). To get the second excited, either promoting again or jumping more.

Wait, perhaps promoting from n=3 to n=4, but that would result in even higher energy.

Wait, maybe another type of configuration. Suppose instead of promoting one particle from n=2, you promote a particle from n=1?

For example, take one particle from n=1 to n=3. Then you have 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3: 18E. So that's 1+8+9=18.

But to do that, you have to promote a particle over the n=2 level, which was already full.

Wait, why not? In the ground state, n=1 is filled with two and n=2 as well. If you promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, you have to leave one in n=1, and put one in n=3. However, n=2 is still filled with two. Thus, energy of 1*1 +2*4 +1*9=18E.

But in terms of energy, which is lower: the configuration (2,1,1) vs (1,2,1). The (2,1,1) is 15E vs (1,2,1) is 18E. So (2,1,1) comes before.

So Order:

1. (2,2,0) 10E (Ground state)

2. (2,1,1) 15E (First excited state)

3. (1,2,1) 18E (Second excited state)

But is (1,2,1) a valid excited state?

In the ground state, all lowest orbitals are filled. To get to (1,2,1), you have to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3. However, promoting a particle from n=1 (which is lower in energy) to n=3 (which is higher) would result in a lower energy cost than promoting from n=2 to n=3? Wait, no. Let's think.

The energy difference to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3 is E_3 - E_1 =9E -1E=8E.

Whereas promoting from n=2 to n=3 is E_3-E_2=9E -4E=5E. So the latter is a lower energy difference. Thus, it is energetically more favorable to promote from n=2 to n=3 (to get the first excited state), since that only requires 5E instead of 8E.

Thus, the list of configurations in order of increasing energy:

1. (2,2,0) 10E (Ground state)

2. (2,1,1) 15E (First excited state)

3. (1,2,1) 18E (Second excited state)

Then followed by (2,0,2) at 20E, etc.

But here is the confusion: which configuration comes first: promoting one from n=1 or another from n=2?

Since promoting one from n=2 takes less energy (cost 5E), which gives 15E, but promoting one from n=1 costs more (8E, leading from 10E to 18E). So first excited state is 15E, next would be 18E, then 20E. So the energies in order are 10E,15E,18E,20E,...

Therefore, the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another possible arrangement where you have three particles in higher orbitals but still compromising the total energy.

Wait, let's make a table of configurations and energies:

1. (2,2,0,0,...): 10E (Ground state)

2. (2,1,1,0,...):15E

3. (1,2,1,0,...):18E

4. (2,0,2,0,...):20E

5. (1,1,2,0,...):1 +4 +18=23E

6. (0,2,2,0,...):0 +8 +18=26E

Etc.

So the next possible states after 18E would be 20E. So in energy order:10,15,18,20,...

Hence, ground, first excited, second excited. So in that case, the answer would be Ground:10E, First excited:15E, Second excited:18E.

But just to be thorough, is there another configuration that might lie between 15E and 18E which I haven't considered?

Let's see. Suppose instead promoting two particles from higher to lower but Pauli allows.

But once particles are in n=1 and n=2, can't get them lower. Alternatively, in some ways, combining a promotion from both n=1 and n=2? For example, promoting one from n=1 to n=2 and another from something? Wait, but n=2 can only hold two. Hence, can't. There's no way to have other configurations that could be lower than 15E except Ground state.

Alternatively, is this an alternative where n=1 has two, n=2 has one, n=3 has one and another in n=4? Wait, but with four particles. No, (2,1,1,0) has four. So can’t go further.

Wait, when I mentioned configuration (1,2,1,0): 1+2+1=4.

Wait, actually, configuration (n1=1, n2=2, n3=1, n4=0) has four particles: two in n=2.

But no. Wait: Confused. Wait, for each n, the number of particles. n=1:1 particle, n=2:2 particles, n=3:1 particle. But since each n can hold two particles. E.g., n=2 can hold two, which is fine. However, how does this configuration come about?

In 1,2,1 configuration: 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3. So 1 +2 +1=4 particles. To reach this state from the ground state, we have to promote one from n=1 to n=3. But what would be the energy needed? The promotion is E=9E -1E=8E. Whereas moving from n=2 to n=3:9E-4E=5E. Therefore, the first excited is 15E (only 5E in promotion), then promoting from another one (from n=2 to n=4? Not sure.

Alternatively, if we could have a combination of promoting two particles: one from n=2 to n=3 (cost 5E) and another from n=1 to n=2. Wait, but n=2 is already full. No space in n=2.

Alternatively, it may not be possible. So it's likely that the order as 10E,15E,18E,20E.

So based on this, the energies would be:

Ground state: 10E

First excited state:15E

Second excited state:18E

But maybe not?

Wait, to verify, let me check the possible arrangements for the particles.

Given that the lowest energy configuration is filled as (2,2,0,...). The total energy is 2E +8E=10E. To reach the first excited state, the minimal energy increase would come from moving one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2 in this case) to the next available level (n=3). This leads to (2,1,1) with energy 2E +4E +9E=15E. Then, the next possible minimal energy increase would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but then n=2 has zero, leading to (2,0,2) which is 2E +0 +18E=20E. Alternatively, if you can move a different particle, from a lower level. Since the next available higher level is relatively higher, the promotion comes with a larger energy cost.

Alternatively, can one spin up be promoted to a higher level while leaving a lower level still half-filled?

Alternatively, another strategy is to think of the possible configurations and arrange them by their total energies.

Looking at configurations:

1. (2,2,0) - 10E: Ground state

2. (2,1,1) - 15E

3. (1,2,1) -18E

4. (2,0,2) -20E

5. (1,1,2) -23E

6. (0,2,2) -26E

Additionally, there are other possible ways if we start putting particles in n=4. For example, (2,1,0,1) but that would have energy 2*1 +1*4 +1*16=2+4+16=22E. Hmm, so 22E is between 20E and 23E.

Wait, (2,1,0,1): two in n=1, one in n=2, none in n=3, one in n=4. So 2 +4 +0 +16=22E. So that's another possible state. Then that would be, energy-wise, between (1,2,1) 18E and (2,0,2) 20E and (2,1,0,1) 22E. Wait, but no: 18E, 20E,22E. So actually, the system could go to lower energy if after 15E, sometimes spreading out particles across other orbitals?

Wait, but how is the ordering here?

Suppose we have Ground State (2,2,0):10E.

First excited: (2,1,1):15E.

Then, next get excited either by putting another in n=3 (from n=2 to n=3:(2,0,2):20E ) or promote from lower n to higher.

But instead of putting two in n=3, maybe putting one in n=4. So from n=2 to n=4: One in n=4. So let's see. Suppose (2,1,0,1): So moving one from n=3 (which we had one) to n=4? Wait, original configuration after first excited state: (2,1,1). To make (2,1,0,1), you promote from n=3 to n=4. Which would be a lower cost? The energy cost is E4 - E3=16E-9E=7E. Compared to promoting from n=2: That would be E4 -E2=16E -4E=12E. So promoting an already excited particle (in n=3) to go to n=4 for only 7E. But wait, starting from (2,1,1), you can promote the particle in n=3 to n=4, resulting in (2,1,0,1) with energy 2E +4E +0 +16E=22E. But if we first have (2,1,1)=15E, to get to (2,1,0,1)=22E, but also doing that would be cost 7E.

Alternatively, if from GS (10E) you promote a second particle: like but that requires an energy.

Alternatively, states like (1,1,1,1), but with all four particles in different n's? But each n can hold two. So the configuration (1,1,1,1) is possible (each n from 1 to4 one particles). The total energy would be 1 +4 +9 +16=30E, which is much higher.

Therefore, is 18E ->(1,2,1) or 20E, or 22E next? The previous analysis on energy levels would lead moving a particle from lower or higher states.

Wait, but in (2,1,1) is the highest level in n=3. If the system is in the (2,1,1) configuration and you can promote any existing electron. Since electrons are in n=1 (filled), n=2 (half-filled), and n=3 (half-filled). Now, the possible promotions would be from lowest energy states to higher, but the highest electron that can be promoted at the lowest cost would be the one in n=3. For example.

But promoting from n=1 (lowest) would jump two levels to n=3 (from price 8E) while promoting from n=3 to n=4 is a 7E. So cost 7E. But having the four particles:

Wait, let's clarify. The transitions between states. Suppose you want the possible excited states where only one particle is promoted from the ground state. But in this case, the next excited states may involve multiple promotions?

But the problem stipulates the second excited state. From ground state, which is first, after first excited state. But our analysis showed 15E, 18E, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the order is 10E,15E,18E, which corresponds to the next minimal energy steps. So maybe the decreasing order is:

Ground state:10,

First excited:15,

Second excited:18,

Third excited:20,

and so on.

But to confirm this, perhaps we can observe the energy orderings of possible configurations and their total energies:

(2,2,0):10E

Move one from n=2 to n=3: (2,1,1):15E

Move the next from n=2 to n=3:(2,0,2):20E OR move one from n=1 to n=3: (1,2,1):18E OR move one from n=3 to n=4: (2,1,0,1):22E

But which of these transitions is lower in energy? Let's see:

Moving the second particle from n=2 to n=3: gives (2,0,2) with energy increase to 20E. So requires cost (9E -4E)=5E again? Wait, no. If you have (2,1,1) as the previous state at 15E, promoting the second particle: (2,0,2) requires (+5E each), but n=2 to n=3. Wait actually the energy difference between the second and first excited states is:

Ground state:10E

First excited:15E (10E +5E)

Second excited:20E (15E +5E). This is only if we follow the same pattern.

But in reality, from 15E, promoting from n=2 to n=3 would require 5E more: (2,0,2). But from (2,1,1), the next possible step might not be putting another into n=3 but moving a different particle.

However, does the next higher energy state correspond to:

Option 1: (1,2,1) with energy 1E +8E +9E=18E. So this state can be achieved by promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3. So this requires adding 8E compared to the ground state. Ground state is 10E. Hence, (1,2,1)=18E is +8E above ground, but compared to the first excited state at 15E, it is +3E higher. Similarly, moving a particle from n=3 to n=4 in the first excited state will yield 22E=15+7E. So which is better?

Wait, but here lies the problem: what tells us which comes first? Without calculating the state energies and then comparing them, but actually you need to think which is energetically higher.(18 is less than20 and also less than22? 18 is the next?)

Wait, compute total energies:

After Ground 10E,

- (2,1,1):15E,

- (1,2,1):18E,

- (2,0,2):20E,

- (2,1,0,1):22E,

- (1,1,1,1):30E,

Therefore, in order:10,15,18,20,22,30,...

Therefore, the three lowest energy states are:

1. Ground state(2,2,0):10E

2. First excited state(2,1,1):15E

3. Second excited state(1,2,1):18E

And the third excited state is (2,0,2) at20E, etc.

Therefore, according to this, answer would require an ground state energy=10E, first excited=15E, second excited=18E.

But perhaps alternative reference?

Alternatively, the measurement of excited states is not according to total energy but to the energy level above ground?

No, in general, excited states are ordered by their total energy. So the first excited state is the first higher energy than the ground state, the second excited state is the next, etc. So in our case, above 10E is 15E, next is18E.

Thus, ground state:10E, first excited:15E, second excited:18E.

Therefore, this should be the answer. Thus, boxed answers:

Ground state: \boxed{10E}

First excited state: \boxed{15E}

Second excited state: \boxed{18E}

**Final Answer**
The energy of the ground state is \boxed{10E}, the first excited state is \boxed{15E}, and the second excited state is \boxed{18E}.

Actually, in spin states, each spatial orbital can hold two electrons (with opposite spins). If there are two particles in n=1 (each with different spin), then spatial orbital n=1 is full. Similarly n=2 can hold two. However, promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 would remove one from n=2 and add one to n=3 indeed.\n\nBut is there a lower energy configuration when you don’t fill n=2 first?\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nWait, in 1D, energies go up as n^2. So filling the lowest n first (1, 1, 2, 2). If we need to make the first excited state, we can promote one electron from n=2 to n=3. So the energy difference between 10E base to 15E.\n\nAlternatively, if we tried to promote two electrons? But that would require to n=3 and n=4?\n\nWait, if we tried to have configuration as 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, and 1 in n=4? But that would sum to 2E + 9E + 16E=27E, which is even higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there can be other promotions? The idea is that first excited state should be the configuration with the next lowest energy after the ground state.\n\nBut when starting from the full ground state, the first possible excitation is moving one particle from the highest filled level (n=2) to the next available (n=3). Therefore, first excited state is 15E.\n\nBut wait, wait another thought. Suppose there are 4 fermions (spin 1/2). So per spatial orbital, 2 particles. The filling is 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 for the ground state. Hence, all lower levels are filled. For the first excited state, the next available configuration would be by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next level (n=3). Hence, n=1 filled (2 particles), n=2 has one particle, n=3 has one particle. Hence, total energy 2*E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E +9E=15E. Alternatively, could there be another way where a different arrangement with lower energy?\n\nIf instead you leave a hole not in n=2 but some other way? Let me see. Wait, if I put three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But since per Pauli each n can have max two particles. That\'s invalid; n=1 can only hold two particles. Similarly, arranging particles in higher orbitals and leaving lower ones is forbidden by Pauli.\n\nUnless you can. Wait, no: in the Pauli principle, as per standard filling, you need to fill lower levels first. But when creating excited states, you can have a lower energy if you have multiple particles in lower levels even when partially filled but with some promoted. But in such case if the total energy is less than 15E.\n\nLooking back, the total possible energy levels when moving particles. The first excitation with two spatial levels filled: 2,2 and then perhaps n=3.\n\nBut wait suppose you have  existed a configuration with two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Alternatively, we could have two in n=1 and two in n=3. But two in n=3 would require that n=3 is higher than n=2, so energy would be higher. Therefore, 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=3 would be 2E + 2*9E= 20E which is higher than 15E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe three particles in n=1 and one in n=3. But again, with three particles in n=1, that’s impossible because each spatial orbital can only have two. So that is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the possible minimal excited configuration is 15E for first excited. Then the second excited would be?\n\nAfter 15E (first excited), the next possible energy would be: If I promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, thereby having configurations 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. Then total energy would be 2E + 2*9E= 20E.\n\nBut another alternative is perhaps promoting the particle from n=1 to n=3? If I try that: That would require n=1: 1 particle (leaving one hole), n=2: 2 particles, n=3: 1 particle. The energy: 1*E + 2*4E +1*9E= E + 8E +9E= 18E. This is lower than 20E. So 18E would be the next excited state. Wait—is that possible?\n\nWait, but how would you get that configuration? Moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would leave n=1 with one particle, and n=3 with one. Since we started from ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. By promotion from n=1 to n=3, one particle would have to go from n=1 to n=3. But since n=1 had two particles, we can only take one of them and put in n=3. But is that permissible under Pauli? If so, the new configuration: n=1 has one particle (since you can have two maximum; removing one means one left with opposite spin?), wait, actually, when we filled n=1, it had two particles, one spin up, one spin down. If we remove one particle, how do we choose which spin? Just remove either one. Then n=1 would have a single particle (spin up, maybe). Then the other goes to n=3 (spin up or down?). Since in n=3, we can have two particles as well. So, putting one particle in n=3 (same spin as the particles in n=1? Or not? Wait, spin is separate. If we’re taking a particle from n=1 (with spin up and spin down), move one to n=3, the spin is maintained. But actually, in fermions, each single-particle state is determined by spatial part and spin part. So in the original filling, each orbital (e.g., n=1 with spin up, n=1 spin down; n=2 spin up, n=2 spin down). So the occupied states are |1↑⟩, |1↓⟩, |2↑⟩, |2↓⟩.\n\nSo to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, you need to take, say, |1↑⟩ → |3↑⟩, keeping |1↓⟩. Then the new states would be |1↓⟩, |2↑⟩, |2↓⟩, |3↑⟩. Now instead of total energy 2*1² E + 2*2² E = 2 + 8=10E, it\'s 1*1² E + 2*2² E +1*3² E = 1 +8+9=18E.\n\nAlternatively, the first excited state was when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So the arrangement was |1↑⟩, |1↓⟩, |2↑⟩, |3↑⟩. So total energy 2*1² E +1*2² E +1*3² E =2+4+9=15E.\n\nBut which of these has lower energy? The 15E is higher from the original ground state, but when comparing different excited configurations, getting 15E vs 18E? But unless I messed up the ordering.\n\nWait no, 10E is ground, then the first excited is 15E, the next excited is 18E, and then 20E comes next. But depending on the filling order, there could be different energies.\n\nBut to determine the correct ordering, we need to calculate the total energy for each valid configuration. The total energy for:\n\n1. Ground state: 10E.\n2. First excited (promote one from n=2 to n=3): 15E.\n3. Second possibility, promote one from n=1 to n=3: 18E.\nThird possibility, promote next from n=2 to n=4: possible? Let\'s see. So first scenario:\n\nAfter ground state (10E):\n\n- Promote a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to n=3: 15E.\n- Alternatively, promote a particle from n=1 to n=3: gives 1E + 2*4E +1*9E=1+8+9=18E. Higher than 15E. So that can\'t be the first excited state. So first excited must be 15E. Then next would be either 18E or another promotion.\n\nOr, after moving one fromn=2 to n=3 (15E), if you promote another from n=2 to n=3, leading to two in n=3. But n=3 can have up to two. So perhaps if moved the second particle from n=2 to n=3? That would result in configuration 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. So energy 2*1E +0 +2*9E= 2+0+18=20E. Total 20E. But prior to that let\'s check 18E’s config.\n\nHow is 18E achieved? If we lift one from n=1 to n=3, leaving 1 in n=1, but n=2 is still filled with 2. Hmm—wait but can we do that? If the original ground state has two fermions in n=1 and two in n=2, to move one fromn=1 to n=3, you need to leave a hole in n=1. To do that, we need to ensure other energy levels are filled. But n=2 is filled already. To promote one particle from either n=1 or n=2.\n\nIf we have n=1 with 2 particles, n=2 with 2 particles. If we spend energy to promote one from n=1 to some higher lever, that would leave an additional spot in n=1’s spin. Let’s see.\n\nNo, but Pauli\'s exclusion does not require that. You can have lower energy levels with vacancies if particles are promoted upwards. So for example, you could have a configuration of 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3, as long as those aren\'t exceeding the capacity per orbital (each n and spin).\n\nBut spin states are separate, my mistake here.\n\nBut in this case, n=1 can have two particles (spin up and down). If you take one from n=1 (say, spin up), and move it to n=3 (so now n=3 has spin up). So the first orbital n=1 has spin down, n=2 spin up and spin down, and n=3 spin up. Spin down: n=3 could also accept a spin down, but in this case, we have one in n=3.\n\nThis scenario gives a total energy for each particle: 1 (n=1, spin down) * E, n=2 spins up and down (each 4E, so total 8E), and n=3 spin up (9E). So 1E + 8E +9E=18E. So 18E is achievable. However, is it a higher or lower energy than some other configurations?\n\nCompare to configurations where instead of lifting from n=1, you lift two particles from n=2. However, after promoting one from n=2 to get the 15E, promoting a second to something else could be done.\n\nAlternatively, if original ground state (n=1: 2, n=2: 2). First excited: Promote one from n=2 to n=3: 15E. To get second excited state: Could we press another promotion?\n\nIf we have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Total 15E. To get next excited state: You can promote another particle either from n=2 to n=4 (if considering sequence to other orbitals), considering how energy increases. Here, n=4\'s energy would be 16E (since E_4 = 16E). But moving to n=4 gives a higher energy.\n\nSo if you promote from n=2 to n=4, result is n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:1, n=4:1. So total energy: 2E + 9E +16E=27E. Alternatively, promote one from the n=3: with n=3 currently having one particle. Moving that to n=4 would take energy even higher— but 27E is such a high energy. Alternatively, if I have these possibilities:\n\nPost first excited state (15E):\n\nOption 1: Promote another from n=2 to the next n=3. But in the first excited state, n=2 already has one left. So if you move the last particle in n=2, leaving n=2 with 0 and n=3 with two. This would result in total energies: 2E (from n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 2*9E= 20E.\n\nOption 2: Promote a particle from n=1 to anywhere (with n=1: losing a particle, as in 18E). Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2. Wait, n=2 has only one but allowed capacity is 2. If n=2 is [1], then we can add another to get n=2 up to two, but that would require energy 4E.\n\nWait, no.  Originally in the first excited state (post initial excitation), if you already have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. If you want to add a particle to n=2, we can\'t, because we have only 4 particles so you can\'t do that. Alternatively, pretend to move a particle from a lower orbital?\n\nWait, perhaps there\'s a miscalculation here. Let me order this again.\n\nWait, four particles. So after moving one to n=3 from n=2 (first excited state, energy 15E), how do we proceed next? To achieve the next excited state, we might move another particle from n=2 to n=3: then fill the second slot in n=3. So n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. That would result in 2E + 2*9E=20E.\n\nAlternatively, Maybe promote a particle from n=1. If we already occupied a higher state, but still can’t add to lower ones. So forbidden.\n\nWait, Let\'s tally the possible states.\n\nPossible configurations with energy as low as possible.\n\n1. All four in n=1 and n=2 (because each can hold 2).\n\nGround state: 10E.\n\n2. Subsequent configurations:\n\nIn exciting, it\'s not like just promoting one; sometimes you have different combinations. However, in first excited, one particle is promoted from highest occupied n=2 to n=3. Then further promoting might involve promoting a lower one to a higher place.\n\nBut by Hund\'s rule for atoms, you have lower energy for certain configurations. But since this is a one-dimensional box rather than an atomic shell, those rules don\'t directly apply. Just energy-wise, the promotion of a particle to the lowest possible unoccupied state. So in that case, after n=1 and n=2 are filled (ground state), possible excited configurations are configurations where a single particle is in a higher n. \n\nBut in the first excited state, you promote one from n=2, leading to 15E.\n\nIf you promote another, one later. But Also, perhaps you can promote two particles to higher states. \n\nAlternatively, different possibilities once you have opened more nodes.\n\nAnd here is a key point: in the initial ground state, spatial orbitals are filled up to n=2.\n\nExcited configurations would have particles in higher n. However, the order in which the different excited states arrange the particles will depend on the energy required for each promotion.\n\nFor each excitation process, the energy change for promoting from n_i to n_j will be ΔE = E_j - E_i. The minimal-energy first excitation is minimal possible ΔE.\n\nOriginally:\n\nGround state is n=1 with two and n=2 with two. Total energy 2E + 8E=10E.\n\nIf promoting a particle to from n=2 (E=4E) to n=3 (E=9E): Energy change of +5E. Calculating total energy becomes 15E.\n\nIf promoting a particle from n=1 (E=E) to n=3: ΔE=8E. So moving a particle from n=1 (which is very low) to n=3 would cost more (that promotion would lead to higher energy state). Therefore, this is a higher energy state compared to promoting from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, promoting from n=2 to n=3 gives a lower energy in the excited state (15E) vs. promoting from n=1 to n=3, which would give 18E, so 15E comes first.\n\nThis way, the first excited state is 15E, then next is the 18E.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there\'s another configuration.\n\nIf we instead split a promotion to n=2 from some yet lower orbital, but there are no lower orbitals. Otherwise, filling multiple particles slightly. Let me check if there exists another configuration where Delta E is smaller.\n\nIf we can promote a particle from n=2 to n=3 (ΔE=5E), which gives total energy +5E relative to the ground state.\n\nAlternatively, Maybe promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2. But in the ground state, n=2 is already filled. Since we need 2 particles at n=2, and in ground state, it\'s already at maximum capacity. We can\'t add any more particles to n=2.\n\nAlternatively, try to exchange particles: for example, moving two particles from n=2 to n=3, but considering how you can’t put more than two in any orbital.\n\nWait, no. If you move two particles from n=2 to n=3, n=3 can take two (each with opposite spin), hence total e. 2n^2E= 2*9=18. Original n=2 particles\' total energy was 8E, moving them leads to 18E, so difference is +10E.\n\nBut the previous excitation (moving only one) leads to +5E (so new total energy 10E+5E=15E). Moving two jumps by 10E to 20E.\n\nIn that case, 15E is first, next 18E from moving a particle from n=1. When that would happen. Wait, is such a transition allowed if already some particles in higher orbitals? Shouldn\'t prevent in being possible.\n\nBut similarly, step by step:\n\nTotal excitation requires taking any occupied orbital and moving to a higher unoccupied. The minimum possible is to promote from the highest occupied.\n\nBut stands to reason that promoting from the highest occupied (n=2) in the ground state to next available n=3, leading to first excited (per Aufbau principle, that is raising a particle from the highest available in ground to lowest available unoccupied.)\n\nIn this case, the process would be (starting from) n =1(2), n=2(2). Promote the highest (n=2) one to 3. Then, n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1), leading to minimal energy at 15E.\n\nThen, for the next excited state: energy quantized whether the next possible movement.\n\nMove the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3. That would result in n=1(2) and n=3(2), giving 20E. Alternatively, promoting from any lower orbitals: For instance, moving a particle from n=1 to n=4 would entail a ΔE of 16E -1E =15E, which would be significant. However, but if moving from n=1 to n=3 (changing ΔE=8E).\n\nWait. The second excited depends on which of these possible configurations leads to the next total lowest energy. Let\'s see which is lower:\n\nAlternatively, actually, promoting one particle from n=1 to n=3 (which will take 1E to 9E, it gives delta of +8E), which might result in a configuration of n=1(1), n=2(2), and n3(1). So the total energy is 1E + 8E +9E=18E. Which is higher than 15E, but lower than 20E.\n\nAlternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 (occupation 2) to n=4 (which would give delta E= 16E -1E =15E), so energy difference +15E, leading to 10E -1E +16E=25E. But else this is higher energy.\n\nSo among these options：\n\nAfter first excited (15E): next possible transitions:\n\n- Promote second particle from n=2(1) to n=3: result in n=2（0）→ adding one more to n=3, so n=3 has two. Total energy=2E +2*9E= 2E+18E=20E. \n\nOr move a particle down.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the energy levels for four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we must respect the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that each quantum state can hold at most two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down).

1. **Ground State**:
   - The lowest energy levels fill first. Each energy level \( n \) can accommodate two particles.
   - Fill \( n = 1 \) with 2 particles (energy \( E_1 = E \)) and \( n = 2 \) with 2 particles (energy \( E_2 = 4E \)).
   - Total energy for the ground state: 
     \[
     2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2 \cdot 4E = 2E + 8E = 10E
     \]

2. **First Excited State**:
   - Promote one particle from the highest occupied level \( n = 2 \) to the next available level \( n = 3 \).
   - The configuration becomes: 2 particles in \( n = 1 \), 1 particle in \( n = 2 \), and 1 particle in \( n = 3 \).
   - Total energy for the first excited state:
     \[
     2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
     \]

3. **Second Excited State**:
   - Promote one particle from \( n = 1 \) to \( n = 3 \). This leaves 1 particle in \( n = 1 \), keeps 2 particles in \( n = 2 \), and adds 1 more particle in \( n = 3 \).
   - Total energy for the second excited state:
     \[
     1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E
     \]

Thus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are:

- **Ground state**: \boxed{10E}
- **First excited state**: \boxed{15E}
- **Second excited state**: \boxed{18E}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 Wait—no. Actually, in spin states, each spatial orbital can hold two electrons (with opposite spins). If there are two particles in n=1 (each with different spin), then spatial orbital n=1 is full. Similarly n=2 can hold two. However, promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 would remove one from n=2 and add one to n=3 indeed.

But is there a lower energy configuration when you don’t fill n=2 first?

Wait, let me check.

Wait, in 1D, energies go up as n^2. So filling the lowest n first (1, 1, 2, 2). If we need to make the first excited state, we can promote one electron from n=2 to n=3. So the energy difference between 10E base to 15E.

Alternatively, if we tried to promote two electrons? But that would require to n=3 and n=4?

Wait, if we tried to have configuration as 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 1 in n=3, and 1 in n=4? But that would sum to 2E + 9E + 16E=27E, which is even higher.

Alternatively, maybe there can be other promotions? The idea is that first excited state should be the configuration with the next lowest energy after the ground state.

But when starting from the full ground state, the first possible excitation is moving one particle from the highest filled level (n=2) to the next available (n=3). Therefore, first excited state is 15E.

But wait, wait another thought. Suppose there are 4 fermions (spin 1/2). So per spatial orbital, 2 particles. The filling is 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 for the ground state. Hence, all lower levels are filled. For the first excited state, the next available configuration would be by promoting one particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to the next level (n=3). Hence, n=1 filled (2 particles), n=2 has one particle, n=3 has one particle. Hence, total energy 2*E + 1*4E + 1*9E = 2E + 4E +9E=15E. Alternatively, could there be another way where a different arrangement with lower energy?

If instead you leave a hole not in n=2 but some other way? Let me see. Wait, if I put three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But since per Pauli each n can have max two particles. That's invalid; n=1 can only hold two particles. Similarly, arranging particles in higher orbitals and leaving lower ones is forbidden by Pauli.

Unless you can. Wait, no: in the Pauli principle, as per standard filling, you need to fill lower levels first. But when creating excited states, you can have a lower energy if you have multiple particles in lower levels even when partially filled but with some promoted. But in such case if the total energy is less than 15E.

Looking back, the total possible energy levels when moving particles. The first excitation with two spatial levels filled: 2,2 and then perhaps n=3.

But wait suppose you have  existed a configuration with two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Alternatively, we could have two in n=1 and two in n=3. But two in n=3 would require that n=3 is higher than n=2, so energy would be higher. Therefore, 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=3 would be 2E + 2*9E= 20E which is higher than 15E.

Alternatively, maybe three particles in n=1 and one in n=3. But again, with three particles in n=1, that’s impossible because each spatial orbital can only have two. So that is invalid.

Therefore, the possible minimal excited configuration is 15E for first excited. Then the second excited would be?

After 15E (first excited), the next possible energy would be: If I promote another particle from n=2 to n=3, thereby having configurations 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. Then total energy would be 2E + 2*9E= 20E.

But another alternative is perhaps promoting the particle from n=1 to n=3? If I try that: That would require n=1: 1 particle (leaving one hole), n=2: 2 particles, n=3: 1 particle. The energy: 1*E + 2*4E +1*9E= E + 8E +9E= 18E. This is lower than 20E. So 18E would be the next excited state. Wait—is that possible?

Wait, but how would you get that configuration? Moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would leave n=1 with one particle, and n=3 with one. Since we started from ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. By promotion from n=1 to n=3, one particle would have to go from n=1 to n=3. But since n=1 had two particles, we can only take one of them and put in n=3. But is that permissible under Pauli? If so, the new configuration: n=1 has one particle (since you can have two maximum; removing one means one left with opposite spin?), wait, actually, when we filled n=1, it had two particles, one spin up, one spin down. If we remove one particle, how do we choose which spin? Just remove either one. Then n=1 would have a single particle (spin up, maybe). Then the other goes to n=3 (spin up or down?). Since in n=3, we can have two particles as well. So, putting one particle in n=3 (same spin as the particles in n=1? Or not? Wait, spin is separate. If we’re taking a particle from n=1 (with spin up and spin down), move one to n=3, the spin is maintained. But actually, in fermions, each single-particle state is determined by spatial part and spin part. So in the original filling, each orbital (e.g., n=1 with spin up, n=1 spin down; n=2 spin up, n=2 spin down). So the occupied states are |1↑⟩, |1↓⟩, |2↑⟩, |2↓⟩.

So to promote a particle from n=1 to n=3, you need to take, say, |1↑⟩ → |3↑⟩, keeping |1↓⟩. Then the new states would be |1↓⟩, |2↑⟩, |2↓⟩, |3↑⟩. Now instead of total energy 2*1² E + 2*2² E = 2 + 8=10E, it's 1*1² E + 2*2² E +1*3² E = 1 +8+9=18E.

Alternatively, the first excited state was when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So the arrangement was |1↑⟩, |1↓⟩, |2↑⟩, |3↑⟩. So total energy 2*1² E +1*2² E +1*3² E =2+4+9=15E.

But which of these has lower energy? The 15E is higher from the original ground state, but when comparing different excited configurations, getting 15E vs 18E? But unless I messed up the ordering.

Wait no, 10E is ground, then the first excited is 15E, the next excited is 18E, and then 20E comes next. But depending on the filling order, there could be different energies.

But to determine the correct ordering, we need to calculate the total energy for each valid configuration. The total energy for:

1. Ground state: 10E.
2. First excited (promote one from n=2 to n=3): 15E.
3. Second possibility, promote one from n=1 to n=3: 18E.
Third possibility, promote next from n=2 to n=4: possible? Let's see. So first scenario:

After ground state (10E):

- Promote a particle from the highest occupied level (n=2) to n=3: 15E.
- Alternatively, promote a particle from n=1 to n=3: gives 1E + 2*4E +1*9E=1+8+9=18E. Higher than 15E. So that can't be the first excited state. So first excited must be 15E. Then next would be either 18E or another promotion.

Or, after moving one fromn=2 to n=3 (15E), if you promote another from n=2 to n=3, leading to two in n=3. But n=3 can have up to two. So perhaps if moved the second particle from n=2 to n=3? That would result in configuration 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. So energy 2*1E +0 +2*9E= 2+0+18=20E. Total 20E. But prior to that let's check 18E’s config.

How is 18E achieved? If we lift one from n=1 to n=3, leaving 1 in n=1, but n=2 is still filled with 2. Hmm—wait but can we do that? If the original ground state has two fermions in n=1 and two in n=2, to move one fromn=1 to n=3, you need to leave a hole in n=1. To do that, we need to ensure other energy levels are filled. But n=2 is filled already. To promote one particle from either n=1 or n=2.

If we have n=1 with 2 particles, n=2 with 2 particles. If we spend energy to promote one from n=1 to some higher lever, that would leave an additional spot in n=1’s spin. Let’s see.

No, but Pauli's exclusion does not require that. You can have lower energy levels with vacancies if particles are promoted upwards. So for example, you could have a configuration of 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3, as long as those aren't exceeding the capacity per orbital (each n and spin).

But spin states are separate, my mistake here.

But in this case, n=1 can have two particles (spin up and down). If you take one from n=1 (say, spin up), and move it to n=3 (so now n=3 has spin up). So the first orbital n=1 has spin down, n=2 spin up and spin down, and n=3 spin up. Spin down: n=3 could also accept a spin down, but in this case, we have one in n=3.

This scenario gives a total energy for each particle: 1 (n=1, spin down) * E, n=2 spins up and down (each 4E, so total 8E), and n=3 spin up (9E). So 1E + 8E +9E=18E. So 18E is achievable. However, is it a higher or lower energy than some other configurations?

Compare to configurations where instead of lifting from n=1, you lift two particles from n=2. However, after promoting one from n=2 to get the 15E, promoting a second to something else could be done.

Alternatively, if original ground state (n=1: 2, n=2: 2). First excited: Promote one from n=2 to n=3: 15E. To get second excited state: Could we press another promotion?

If we have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Total 15E. To get next excited state: You can promote another particle either from n=2 to n=4 (if considering sequence to other orbitals), considering how energy increases. Here, n=4's energy would be 16E (since E_4 = 16E). But moving to n=4 gives a higher energy.

So if you promote from n=2 to n=4, result is n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:1, n=4:1. So total energy: 2E + 9E +16E=27E. Alternatively, promote one from the n=3: with n=3 currently having one particle. Moving that to n=4 would take energy even higher— but 27E is such a high energy. Alternatively, if I have these possibilities:

Post first excited state (15E):

Option 1: Promote another from n=2 to the next n=3. But in the first excited state, n=2 already has one left. So if you move the last particle in n=2, leaving n=2 with 0 and n=3 with two. This would result in total energies: 2E (from n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 2*9E= 20E.

Option 2: Promote a particle from n=1 to anywhere (with n=1: losing a particle, as in 18E). Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2. Wait, n=2 has only one but allowed capacity is 2. If n=2 is [1], then we can add another to get n=2 up to two, but that would require energy 4E.

Wait, no.  Originally in the first excited state (post initial excitation), if you already have n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. If you want to add a particle to n=2, we can't, because we have only 4 particles so you can't do that. Alternatively, pretend to move a particle from a lower orbital?

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me order this again.

Wait, four particles. So after moving one to n=3 from n=2 (first excited state, energy 15E), how do we proceed next? To achieve the next excited state, we might move another particle from n=2 to n=3: then fill the second slot in n=3. So n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. That would result in 2E + 2*9E=20E.

Alternatively, Maybe promote a particle from n=1. If we already occupied a higher state, but still can’t add to lower ones. So forbidden.

Wait, Let's tally the possible states.

Possible configurations with energy as low as possible.

1. All four in n=1 and n=2 (because each can hold 2).

Ground state: 10E.

2. Subsequent configurations:

In exciting, it's not like just promoting one; sometimes you have different combinations. However, in first excited, one particle is promoted from highest occupied n=2 to n=3. Then further promoting might involve promoting a lower one to a higher place.

But by Hund's rule for atoms, you have lower energy for certain configurations. But since this is a one-dimensional box rather than an atomic shell, those rules don't directly apply. Just energy-wise, the promotion of a particle to the lowest possible unoccupied state. So in that case, after n=1 and n=2 are filled (ground state), possible excited configurations are configurations where a single particle is in a higher n. 

But in the first excited state, you promote one from n=2, leading to 15E.

If you promote another, one later. But Also, perhaps you can promote two particles to higher states. 

Alternatively, different possibilities once you have opened more nodes.

And here is a key point: in the initial ground state, spatial orbitals are filled up to n=2.

Excited configurations would have particles in higher n. However, the order in which the different excited states arrange the particles will depend on the energy required for each promotion.

For each excitation process, the energy change for promoting from n_i to n_j will be ΔE = E_j - E_i. The minimal-energy first excitation is minimal possible ΔE.

Originally:

Ground state is n=1 with two and n=2 with two. Total energy 2E + 8E=10E.

If promoting a particle to from n=2 (E=4E) to n=3 (E=9E): Energy change of +5E. Calculating total energy becomes 15E.

If promoting a particle from n=1 (E=E) to n=3: ΔE=8E. So moving a particle from n=1 (which is very low) to n=3 would cost more (that promotion would lead to higher energy state). Therefore, this is a higher energy state compared to promoting from n=2 to n=3. Therefore, promoting from n=2 to n=3 gives a lower energy in the excited state (15E) vs. promoting from n=1 to n=3, which would give 18E, so 15E comes first.

This way, the first excited state is 15E, then next is the 18E.

But wait, perhaps there's another configuration.

If we instead split a promotion to n=2 from some yet lower orbital, but there are no lower orbitals. Otherwise, filling multiple particles slightly. Let me check if there exists another configuration where Delta E is smaller.

If we can promote a particle from n=2 to n=3 (ΔE=5E), which gives total energy +5E relative to the ground state.

Alternatively, Maybe promoting a particle from n=1 to n=2. But in the ground state, n=2 is already filled. Since we need 2 particles at n=2, and in ground state, it's already at maximum capacity. We can't add any more particles to n=2.

Alternatively, try to exchange particles: for example, moving two particles from n=2 to n=3, but considering how you can’t put more than two in any orbital.

Wait, no. If you move two particles from n=2 to n=3, n=3 can take two (each with opposite spin), hence total e. 2n^2E= 2*9=18. Original n=2 particles' total energy was 8E, moving them leads to 18E, so difference is +10E.

But the previous excitation (moving only one) leads to +5E (so new total energy 10E+5E=15E). Moving two jumps by 10E to 20E.

In that case, 15E is first, next 18E from moving a particle from n=1. When that would happen. Wait, is such a transition allowed if already some particles in higher orbitals? Shouldn't prevent in being possible.

But similarly, step by step:

Total excitation requires taking any occupied orbital and moving to a higher unoccupied. The minimum possible is to promote from the highest occupied.

But stands to reason that promoting from the highest occupied (n=2) in the ground state to next available n=3, leading to first excited (per Aufbau principle, that is raising a particle from the highest available in ground to lowest available unoccupied.)

In this case, the process would be (starting from) n =1(2), n=2(2). Promote the highest (n=2) one to 3. Then, n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1), leading to minimal energy at 15E.

Then, for the next excited state: energy quantized whether the next possible movement.

Move the remaining particle in n=2 to n=3. That would result in n=1(2) and n=3(2), giving 20E. Alternatively, promoting from any lower orbitals: For instance, moving a particle from n=1 to n=4 would entail a ΔE of 16E -1E =15E, which would be significant. However, but if moving from n=1 to n=3 (changing ΔE=8E).

Wait. The second excited depends on which of these possible configurations leads to the next total lowest energy. Let's see which is lower:

Alternatively, actually, promoting one particle from n=1 to n=3 (which will take 1E to 9E, it gives delta of +8E), which might result in a configuration of n=1(1), n=2(2), and n3(1). So the total energy is 1E + 8E +9E=18E. Which is higher than 15E, but lower than 20E.

Alternatively, promoting a particle from n=1 (occupation 2) to n=4 (which would give delta E= 16E -1E =15E), so energy difference +15E, leading to 10E -1E +16E=25E. But else this is higher energy.

So among these options：

After first excited (15E): next possible transitions:

- Promote second particle from n=2(1) to n=3: result in n=2（0）→ adding one more to n=3, so n=3 has two. Total energy=2E +2*9E= 2E+18E=20E. 

Or move a particle down. All fermions need to obey Pauli with antisymmetry.

Alternatively, allowing one more particle to move from higher up but that only raises. But another possibility: moving a particle from n=1 to n=4. But prior ex.:

Wait, but actually, after first excited state (15E: 2 at 1, 1 at 2, and 1 at 3), the possible promotions candidates could be:

1. Promotion from n=2(1) to n=4. The particle in n=2 moves to n=4, resulting in 2E（n=1） +0（n=2 left after moving) +9E（n=3） +16E（n=4). Total=2+0+9+16=27E.

2. Promotion from n=2(1) to n=3(k), but n=3 already has one. So removing from n=2 and adding to n=4 leads to higher energy.

3. Promotion from n=3(1) to n=4. Same pattern as one: 2E + n=2 1. Promoting in n=3 part. Entry to n4(particle at n=3 to n=4). Time leaving n=3 has now two particles.

Wait, n=3 originally has one particle, promote to n=4. Take n=3 single particle into its that. The resulting configuration: n3 is emptied. 2 in n=1，1 in n=4, remaining n=2. So energy=2E +4E +16E=22E. But perhaps.

Alternatively, if I just change configurations without worrying if error occurs.

Alternatively, if after first excited state (15E): structure like 2,1,1,,p,q. Isn't clear. Maybe I should simultaneously construct all possible distinct many-body states and sort them by energy.

Alternatively, if physical policy where certain rules determine excitation. The Principle助手。

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is the case where another particle is promoted to a higher level, different from moving two, by the fermions didn't same as progressive higher n promotion.

But given it's tedious,tavkin time perhaps  making sure economics different with应该把N+states and their energies.

But given that particle exchange occurs, so whatever configuration maximizes resultant lower energy.

But if we have the ground state first (10E), first excited at 15E when promoting a n=2 (B. So perhaps promoting other particles.

Alternatively, perhaps also possible that in an excited state noting that after removing a particle from open she лет.

Regardless, just considering possible minimal energy progression, early.

Total energies:

- Ground: 10E.

- First excited configuration: moving one from n=2 to n=3 → 15E.

- Next possible promotion: move one from n=1 to which n? Moving one from n=1 to n=3 giving 18E.

Alternatively, move theremaining from n=2 to somewhere, but previously in first excited we had n=1:2, n=2:* Doesn't make wa sense.

Summary: In first excited state (having configuration n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1) → 15E.

Now to find next excited state, either:

(a) Promote fromN=1 ton=3”. This gives nggering 1(1), '+' move one toWard requires that: total energy?

If promote from n=1：1E energy toturnal ( removed) and going to 9E. So ΔE=8E.

Thus reduces powerone particle 1 to leaveAfter your left with one in n=1, and then add a new particle in n=3.

Another think about the spin.

Yet, he p in the problem.

The key is, energyPer Won't depend on spin directions since it's a one-dimensional potential well with just spatial energy. Spin only introduces multiplicities, but according之前的 description, given that energy levels are open or closed based on spin multiplicity, we just assign two particles per spatial orbital due to two possible spin states. Therefore, all mentioned above holds.

Therefore, concluding:

Without erros in my logic, the energies are.

Thus, including the remaining two in n=1 gives a total of two (n=1), one (n=2), and one (n=3). Hence, the states can still be spin accommodates: for n=2, the remaining particle has (say) spin up, while the one in n=3 could be spin up or down. But filling spatially, to comply with Pauli, n=1 has two (spin up and down), n=2 has one (spin up or down?), and n=3 similarly one. However, each spatial level can still hold two, but in practice, once a level is only partially filled (singlet), that\'s allowed. Thus, such arrangements are legitimate.\n\nTherefore, confirming that the first excited state is 2E + 4E +9E =15E.\n\nWhat\'s the next state, the second excited state? Possibly different configurations leading to even higher energy.\n\nThe next possibility could be configuration where two particles have moved: either two from n=2 to n=3 and n=4, or one to n=3 and one to n=4. But with four particles in total. Let me check.\n\nWe need to arrange four particles such that they occupy higher energy levels. We already had the first case: 15E. The next one should have a higher total energy. Let\'s enumerate possible distributions.\n\nPossible configurations for four particles under Pauli exclusion:\n\n- **Ground State**: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 0 in others (total energy 10E)\n\n- **First Excited State**: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 (15E)\n\n- **Alternate configurations**: Are there other arrangements? Let me list all possible distributions where:\n\nEach energy level n can have 0, 1, or 2 particles (given spin-1/2), and total particles must be 4.\n\nPossible distributions:\n\n1. 2,2,0,... (10E) [Ground State]\n\n2. 2,1,1,0,... (15E) [First Excited State]\n\n3. 1,2,1,0,... (1 + 8 + 9 = 18E)\n\n4. 2,0,2,0,... (2 + 0 + 18 = 20E)\n\n5. 1,1,2,0,... (1 + 4 + 18 =23E)\n\n6. Other combinations? Maybe like 2,0,1,1,... (2 +0+9 +16=27E)\n\nProbably, but there’s an order here.\n\nNow, order by increasing total energy:\n\n1. 10E (Configuration 1: 2,2,0,...)\n2. 15E (Configuration 2: 2,1,1,0,...)\n3. 18E (Configuration 3: 1,2,1,0,...)\n4. 20E (Configuration 4: 2,0,2,0,...)\n5. 23E (Configuration 5:1,1,2,0,...)\n6. 27E (Configuration 6: 2,0,1,1,...)\nEtc.\n\nThus, the Ground State is first, then first excited state with 15E, then second excited state with 18E.\n\nBut wait, the configuration "1,2,1,0,..." – total energy E * (1 + 4*2 + 9*1) = 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9 = 1 +8 +9 =18E.\n\nAlternatively, how?\n\nWait, if particles are arranged as 1 (n=1), 2 (n=2), 1 (n=3). So energies are E_1, E_2, E_2, E_3. But 1 in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. So the energy is 1*E + 2*4E +1*9E = 1E + 8E +9E = 18E. That is higher than 15E but lower than 20E.\n\nSimilarly, configuration 4 gives 2 in n=3 (without n=2): that would be 2*E (n=1) +0*E2 (n=2) +2*9E (n=3) = 2 +0 +18 =20E.\n\nBut why would configuration 3 (18E) be accessible? Is that a valid excited state? To get 1,2,1 configuration, how is that populated? If one particle is moved from n=1 (leaving one behind) into n=2, making three particles but n=2 can only hold two. Wait, because two are already in n=2 (wait, scenario 3 states "1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3". But actually, total particles are four. So that\'s one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Wait, but n=1 initially holds two, but here they leave only one. However, we can only transfer one particle from n=1 to a higher level.\n\nWait, wait. To populate configuration 3 (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3), that might require exciting one particle from n=1 to n=3 or something. But moving a particle from n=1 to n=3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps that\'s higher in energy. For example, taking a particle from n=1 up. Let\'s compare with the previous configs.\n\nStart with ground state (first case, 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2). To reach configuration 3 (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3), you need to remove one particle from n=1 (originally full with two) and promote it to n=3. That would give energy 2 x E_1 (still? Wait: wait a second.\n\nHold on: if you start with 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2 (total 4). To get to configuration 3 (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3), you must take one particle from n=1 and place it into n=3. But moving from n=1 (E) to n=3 (9E) would increase the energy much more than simply moving one from n=2 to n=3. Here, moving one from n=1 to n=3 will make the energy change: -E +9E =8E difference. While if moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, that changes 4E to 9E, net +5E.\n\nThus, moving from ground state (10E ), total energy would be 2*E (n=1) + 1*4E (n=2) +1*9E (n=3) =15E when moving from n=2 to n=3, but moving from n=1 to n=3 would result in (1E + 8E +9E) =18E, which is higher. Therefore, the first excited state must arise from promoting one n=2 to n=3 (15E), and next is promoting a n=1 to n=3, making 18E.\n\nSo the first excited state is 15E, second excited state 18E? That contradicts my previous mistake. Wait, but which transition steals the last?\n\nBut theoretically, which one is higher? Yes, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would cost more energy than from n=2 to n=3. Indeed, from the first excited state (15E), promoting another particle (but hanging which).\n\nWait complicating. Let\'s think system\'s occupation in terms of filled vs. partially filled.\n\nGround state: two lowest levels filled (n=1:2, n=2:2). Total energy 2*(1E) + 2*(4E)=10E.\n\nFirst excited: Look for the minimal additional energy. There are two ways:\n\na) Excite a particle from the highest filled level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). This gives occupancy: 2,1,1. Total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.\n\nb) Alternatively, if possible, maybe there is a lower energy by exciting two particles to the same higher level. But due to Pauli exclusion we can only at max fill two per level, so for instance promote two particles to n=3? However, that would require the occupancy: n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. But that would cost 2E +0 + 18E=20E. That\'s more than 15E. So of course, wanting to minimize the total energy, the first option (a) is lower.\n\nAlternatively, occupying different higher levels but not completely filling some. But then exciting two particles to n=3 and n=4? For example:\n\nGround state is 2,2,0,0. If promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another to beyond, but that\'s four.\n\nWait, but let\'s imagine another pathway.\n\nBut for four particles, the next excited configuration after 2,1,1 is 1,2,1 really attainable? If yes, whether upon moving particles.\n\nSo, let\'s consider the possible quantization: building occupied states from the bottom up.\n\nWait, maybe possibility for different energy arrangements.\n\nNo, conceptually, the application of the Pauli exclusion and minimum energy may help.\n\nIn the ground state, the four particles occupy the two lowest possible levels (n=1 and n=2 each with two particles). The first excited state must be the next possible configuration with the next highest energy. Since moving one particle up to n=3, giving 2,1,1 with energy 15E, next less energetic state than other configurations.\n\nWait but I need to confirm how Electron configuration (changed here to Fermions in a box) functions. For hydrogen, building up the states considering the quantum numbers and their energies.\n\nIn our case, in 1D infinite well, energy levels quadratically increase with n. Therefore, considering your first two levels filled, the first excitation would be a particle promoted from the highest occupied (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3). Hence resulting in 2,1,1 even though that leaves a hole in n=2 and a particle in n=3.\n\nHence, the first excited state would indeed be 15E, the next one... perhaps promoting another particle, either moving a second from n=2 to n=3, but n=3 can take up two particles. If from 2,1,1, moving the one in n=2 to n=4, getting 2,0,1,1. that is n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:1, n=4:1 => Energy=2E +0 +9E +16E=27E.\n\nBut that seems quite a leap. Alternatively, perhaps moving the electron from n=1 to n=4. Wait.\n\nAlternatively, Maybe is further splitting with spin alignment. Wait, though in a non-magnetic system, there\'s no energy differentiation due to spin. Thus, spin only contributes to degeneracy, but energies are exclusively determined by n.\n\nAlternatively, since n=1 can be fully filled, two particles, higher levels. Thus, the possible subsequent steps after 15E (2,1,1), can there be another arrangement. Maybe filling n=2 to n=3? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps assigning spin multiplicities. Wait, but Pauli allows two per n level. Therefore the maximum in each orbital.\n\nAlternatively, Maybe the second excited state is two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. No, but jumping two filled into a higher n=3 would lead to significant energy.\n\nOr, another logic, perhaps ordered by the sum of the squares:\n\nGround state: 1,1,2,2. So sum(1,1,4,4)= 10 units in terms of E.\n\nFirst excited state: 1,1,4,9. Sum 1,1,4,9. Total 15E. Say, energy levels each given two particles in n=1 (still), something else... Wait maybe confusion.\n\nHold on, no. Total energy is calculated as sum over all particles: each particle\'s individual energy (E_n). Since n=1 has two particles, each with E, total for n=1 is 2E; same goes for others.\n\nHence sets:\n\nGround state:\n\nn=1: 2 particles*1E=2E\n\nn=2: 2 particles*4E=8E\n\nTotal: 10 E\n\nFirst excited state:\n\nn=1:2E\n\nn=2:1*4E\n\nn=3:1*9E\n\nTotal:2+4+9=15E\n\nSecond excited state: the next lowest. Let\'s analyze possibilities. Perhaps:\n\nOption a) Two in n1, Zero in n2, two in n3: leads to 2E + 0 + 18E=20E. But could that be a possible configuration? Starting from first excited (15E), promoting another particle from n2 to n3? But in first excited you have one in n2 and in promoting it to n3, ending up with zero in n2 and two in n3. Would that sum 2E (n1) +0 (n2) + 2*9E (n3) =20E. Alternatively, considering other possibilities.\n\nOption b) One particle in n1, two in n2, one in n4. Energy:1 + 8 +16=25E.\n\nAlternatively, Option c), arranging the particles as one in n1, one in n2, two in n3. Energy:1 +4 +18=23E. But that is difficult because we need to fill in order, but can we even have this?\n\nWait but after the ground state (n=1,2 filled), excited states require promoting particles. The first step is one promoted from n=2 to n=3. To reach another excited state beyond that, you may promote another particle either:\n\n1. From n=2 to a higher n (if any left in n=2 since after promoting one, only one remains in n=2). So the second promotion could take the one from n=2 to n=4, giving two in n=1, none in n=2, one in n=3, 1 in n=4. Total energy: 2E +0 +9E +16E=27E.\n\nBut alternatively, if you promote a particle from n=1 to an upper level instead. That would result in higher energy. For instance, changing a particle from n=1 to n=2 (but n=2 is not full yet in the first excited state).\n\nWait, in the first excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. If the particle from n=1 is promoted to n=2. But n=2 previously has one. Since two particles can occupy n=2, adding one here would total two. Then moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 is possible if there\'s space, but why? But since moving a particle from lower n to higher increases energy (E to 4E), this transition would result in higher total energy.\n\nWait, specifically:\n\nOriginal first excited state:\n\nn1=2 (2E), n2=1 (4E), n3=1 (9E). Total 15E.\n\nMove one particle from n1 (leaving 1) to n2 (total 2 there): so becomes n1=1 (E), n2=2 (8E), n3=1 (9E). Total comes to E +8E +9E=18E.\n\nThus, this configuration: 1,2,1. Which for total energy=18E. Then this becomes the second excited state?\n\nThen, which is lower in total energy compared to the other possibility option a) n2 vacated two, leading to 20E. Hence, would 18E be the second excited state?\n\nBut this prompts that after the first excited state (15E), promoting a particle from n=1 to the available n=2 (since n=2 can hold another) essentially refills n=2 and depletes n=1. But wait isn\'t this contradicting the concept that energy input is required to do that? Actually, moving a particle from n=1 (lower energy) to n=2 (higher energy) requires energy input. So, this is a higher energy state.\n\nWait, but in reality, particles do not lower their energy once excited unless given the chance to emit. But in static configurations (stationary states), these are entirely possible. So, even if you fill particles in higher energy, they are only thinking about total configurations.\n\nBut wait, hang on– once you start with the configuration states (as eigenvalues), their energy is additive. Considering that after promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 (first excited state 2,1,1) versus promoting one from n=1 to n=2 (giving n=1 reduced by one and n=2 increased by one). But in this case the second config raises since moving from lower to higher. So to compare moving particle from n=2 to n3 (ΔE=5 E) or from n1 to n2 (ΔE=3 E). But since the first would have higher energy cost? Wait no.\n\nWait, when you move a particle from n=2 to n3,...\n\nWait when arranging the system, initial particles are placed in the lowest energy slots possible. When moving a particle, you need to spend some energy, but in terms of the states, if we list all possible combinations (without considering transition method), En as sum of the particles\' positions, sorted by increasing energy.\n\nAlternatively, list all possible configurations where particles are located, and compute E sum for each, order them from low to high. First lowest... Several steps?\n\nConfigurations and their total energies:\n\n1. [2,2,0,...] => 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2 +8=10E\n\n2. [2,1,1,0...] =>\n\n   n1:2, n2:1, n3:1 => 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=2+4+9=15E\n\n3. [1,2,1,0…] => n1:1, n2:2, n3:1 => 1*1 +2*4 +1*9=1+8+9=18E\n\n4. [2,0,2,0,...] => n1:2, n2:0, n3:2 =>2*1+0+2*9=2 +0 +18=20E\n\n5. [1,1,2,0...] =>1*1 +1*4 +2*9=1 +4 +18=23E\n\n6. [1,2,0,1...] =>1 +8 +0 +16=25E and others.\n\nBut all these configurations. So ordered:10,15,18,20,23,25...\n\nThus, Ground state:10E\n\nFirst excited:15E\n\nSecond excited:18E\n\nHence, the energy levels of second excited state is 18E.\n\nTherefore, based on hypothetical configs, first and second excited states.\n\nBut the challenge is possible configuration with non-aufbau style filling.

Four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, allowing each energy level \( n \) to hold up to two particles. The energy levels are given by \( E_n = n^2E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \).

1. **Ground State**:
   - The lowest energy configuration places two particles in the lowest energy level \( n=1 \) and the remaining two particles in the next lowest level \( n=2 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E \).

2. **First Excited State**:
   - The next lowest energy configuration involves promoting one particle from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). This results in two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \).

3. **Second Excited State**:
   - The next configuration involves promoting a particle from \( n=1 \) to \( n=2 \), resulting in one particle in \( n=1 \), two particles in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).
   - Total energy: \( 1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E \).

Thus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \(\boxed{10E}\), \(\boxed{15E}\), and \(\boxed{18E}\) respectively.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 So if we have two in n=2, promoting one to n=3 would result in one remaining in n=2 and one in n=3. Thus, including the remaining two in n=1 gives a total of two (n=1), one (n=2), and one (n=3). Hence, the states can still be spin accommodates: for n=2, the remaining particle has (say) spin up, while the one in n=3 could be spin up or down. But filling spatially, to comply with Pauli, n=1 has two (spin up and down), n=2 has one (spin up or down?), and n=3 similarly one. However, each spatial level can still hold two, but in practice, once a level is only partially filled (singlet), that's allowed. Thus, such arrangements are legitimate.

Therefore, confirming that the first excited state is 2E + 4E +9E =15E.

What's the next state, the second excited state? Possibly different configurations leading to even higher energy.

The next possibility could be configuration where two particles have moved: either two from n=2 to n=3 and n=4, or one to n=3 and one to n=4. But with four particles in total. Let me check.

We need to arrange four particles such that they occupy higher energy levels. We already had the first case: 15E. The next one should have a higher total energy. Let's enumerate possible distributions.

Possible configurations for four particles under Pauli exclusion:

- **Ground State**: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 0 in others (total energy 10E)

- **First Excited State**: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 (15E)

- **Alternate configurations**: Are there other arrangements? Let me list all possible distributions where:

Each energy level n can have 0, 1, or 2 particles (given spin-1/2), and total particles must be 4.

Possible distributions:

1. 2,2,0,... (10E) [Ground State]

2. 2,1,1,0,... (15E) [First Excited State]

3. 1,2,1,0,... (1 + 8 + 9 = 18E)

4. 2,0,2,0,... (2 + 0 + 18 = 20E)

5. 1,1,2,0,... (1 + 4 + 18 =23E)

6. Other combinations? Maybe like 2,0,1,1,... (2 +0+9 +16=27E)

Probably, but there’s an order here.

Now, order by increasing total energy:

1. 10E (Configuration 1: 2,2,0,...)
2. 15E (Configuration 2: 2,1,1,0,...)
3. 18E (Configuration 3: 1,2,1,0,...)
4. 20E (Configuration 4: 2,0,2,0,...)
5. 23E (Configuration 5:1,1,2,0,...)
6. 27E (Configuration 6: 2,0,1,1,...)
Etc.

Thus, the Ground State is first, then first excited state with 15E, then second excited state with 18E.

But wait, the configuration "1,2,1,0,..." – total energy E * (1 + 4*2 + 9*1) = 1*1 + 2*4 +1*9 = 1 +8 +9 =18E.

Alternatively, how?

Wait, if particles are arranged as 1 (n=1), 2 (n=2), 1 (n=3). So energies are E_1, E_2, E_2, E_3. But 1 in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. So the energy is 1*E + 2*4E +1*9E = 1E + 8E +9E = 18E. That is higher than 15E but lower than 20E.

Similarly, configuration 4 gives 2 in n=3 (without n=2): that would be 2*E (n=1) +0*E2 (n=2) +2*9E (n=3) = 2 +0 +18 =20E.

But why would configuration 3 (18E) be accessible? Is that a valid excited state? To get 1,2,1 configuration, how is that populated? If one particle is moved from n=1 (leaving one behind) into n=2, making three particles but n=2 can only hold two. Wait, because two are already in n=2 (wait, scenario 3 states "1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, 1 in n=3". But actually, total particles are four. So that's one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Wait, but n=1 initially holds two, but here they leave only one. However, we can only transfer one particle from n=1 to a higher level.

Wait, wait. To populate configuration 3 (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3), that might require exciting one particle from n=1 to n=3 or something. But moving a particle from n=1 to n=3.

Alternatively, perhaps that's higher in energy. For example, taking a particle from n=1 up. Let's compare with the previous configs.

Start with ground state (first case, 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2). To reach configuration 3 (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3), you need to remove one particle from n=1 (originally full with two) and promote it to n=3. That would give energy 2 x E_1 (still? Wait: wait a second.

Hold on: if you start with 2 in n=1 and 2 in n=2 (total 4). To get to configuration 3 (1 in n=1, 2 in n=2,1 in n=3), you must take one particle from n=1 and place it into n=3. But moving from n=1 (E) to n=3 (9E) would increase the energy much more than simply moving one from n=2 to n=3. Here, moving one from n=1 to n=3 will make the energy change: -E +9E =8E difference. While if moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, that changes 4E to 9E, net +5E.

Thus, moving from ground state (10E ), total energy would be 2*E (n=1) + 1*4E (n=2) +1*9E (n=3) =15E when moving from n=2 to n=3, but moving from n=1 to n=3 would result in (1E + 8E +9E) =18E, which is higher. Therefore, the first excited state must arise from promoting one n=2 to n=3 (15E), and next is promoting a n=1 to n=3, making 18E.

So the first excited state is 15E, second excited state 18E? That contradicts my previous mistake. Wait, but which transition steals the last?

But theoretically, which one is higher? Yes, moving a particle from n=1 to n=3 would cost more energy than from n=2 to n=3. Indeed, from the first excited state (15E), promoting another particle (but hanging which).

Wait complicating. Let's think system's occupation in terms of filled vs. partially filled.

Ground state: two lowest levels filled (n=1:2, n=2:2). Total energy 2*(1E) + 2*(4E)=10E.

First excited: Look for the minimal additional energy. There are two ways:

a) Excite a particle from the highest filled level (n=2) to the next available level (n=3). This gives occupancy: 2,1,1. Total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

b) Alternatively, if possible, maybe there is a lower energy by exciting two particles to the same higher level. But due to Pauli exclusion we can only at max fill two per level, so for instance promote two particles to n=3? However, that would require the occupancy: n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. But that would cost 2E +0 + 18E=20E. That's more than 15E. So of course, wanting to minimize the total energy, the first option (a) is lower.

Alternatively, occupying different higher levels but not completely filling some. But then exciting two particles to n=3 and n=4? For example:

Ground state is 2,2,0,0. If promoting one particle from n=2 to n=3 and another to beyond, but that's four.

Wait, but let's imagine another pathway.

But for four particles, the next excited configuration after 2,1,1 is 1,2,1 really attainable? If yes, whether upon moving particles.

So, let's consider the possible quantization: building occupied states from the bottom up.

Wait, maybe possibility for different energy arrangements.

No, conceptually, the application of the Pauli exclusion and minimum energy may help.

In the ground state, the four particles occupy the two lowest possible levels (n=1 and n=2 each with two particles). The first excited state must be the next possible configuration with the next highest energy. Since moving one particle up to n=3, giving 2,1,1 with energy 15E, next less energetic state than other configurations.

Wait but I need to confirm how Electron configuration (changed here to Fermions in a box) functions. For hydrogen, building up the states considering the quantum numbers and their energies.

In our case, in 1D infinite well, energy levels quadratically increase with n. Therefore, considering your first two levels filled, the first excitation would be a particle promoted from the highest occupied (n=2) to the lowest unoccupied level (n=3). Hence resulting in 2,1,1 even though that leaves a hole in n=2 and a particle in n=3.

Hence, the first excited state would indeed be 15E, the next one... perhaps promoting another particle, either moving a second from n=2 to n=3, but n=3 can take up two particles. If from 2,1,1, moving the one in n=2 to n=4, getting 2,0,1,1. that is n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:1, n=4:1 => Energy=2E +0 +9E +16E=27E.

But that seems quite a leap. Alternatively, perhaps moving the electron from n=1 to n=4. Wait.

Alternatively, Maybe is further splitting with spin alignment. Wait, though in a non-magnetic system, there's no energy differentiation due to spin. Thus, spin only contributes to degeneracy, but energies are exclusively determined by n.

Alternatively, since n=1 can be fully filled, two particles, higher levels. Thus, the possible subsequent steps after 15E (2,1,1), can there be another arrangement. Maybe filling n=2 to n=3? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps assigning spin multiplicities. Wait, but Pauli allows two per n level. Therefore the maximum in each orbital.

Alternatively, Maybe the second excited state is two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. No, but jumping two filled into a higher n=3 would lead to significant energy.

Or, another logic, perhaps ordered by the sum of the squares:

Ground state: 1,1,2,2. So sum(1,1,4,4)= 10 units in terms of E.

First excited state: 1,1,4,9. Sum 1,1,4,9. Total 15E. Say, energy levels each given two particles in n=1 (still), something else... Wait maybe confusion.

Hold on, no. Total energy is calculated as sum over all particles: each particle's individual energy (E_n). Since n=1 has two particles, each with E, total for n=1 is 2E; same goes for others.

Hence sets:

Ground state:

n=1: 2 particles*1E=2E

n=2: 2 particles*4E=8E

Total: 10 E

First excited state:

n=1:2E

n=2:1*4E

n=3:1*9E

Total:2+4+9=15E

Second excited state: the next lowest. Let's analyze possibilities. Perhaps:

Option a) Two in n1, Zero in n2, two in n3: leads to 2E + 0 + 18E=20E. But could that be a possible configuration? Starting from first excited (15E), promoting another particle from n2 to n3? But in first excited you have one in n2 and in promoting it to n3, ending up with zero in n2 and two in n3. Would that sum 2E (n1) +0 (n2) + 2*9E (n3) =20E. Alternatively, considering other possibilities.

Option b) One particle in n1, two in n2, one in n4. Energy:1 + 8 +16=25E.

Alternatively, Option c), arranging the particles as one in n1, one in n2, two in n3. Energy:1 +4 +18=23E. But that is difficult because we need to fill in order, but can we even have this?

Wait but after the ground state (n=1,2 filled), excited states require promoting particles. The first step is one promoted from n=2 to n=3. To reach another excited state beyond that, you may promote another particle either:

1. From n=2 to a higher n (if any left in n=2 since after promoting one, only one remains in n=2). So the second promotion could take the one from n=2 to n=4, giving two in n=1, none in n=2, one in n=3, 1 in n=4. Total energy: 2E +0 +9E +16E=27E.

But alternatively, if you promote a particle from n=1 to an upper level instead. That would result in higher energy. For instance, changing a particle from n=1 to n=2 (but n=2 is not full yet in the first excited state).

Wait, in the first excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. If the particle from n=1 is promoted to n=2. But n=2 previously has one. Since two particles can occupy n=2, adding one here would total two. Then moving a particle from n=1 to n=2 is possible if there's space, but why? But since moving a particle from lower n to higher increases energy (E to 4E), this transition would result in higher total energy.

Wait, specifically:

Original first excited state:

n1=2 (2E), n2=1 (4E), n3=1 (9E). Total 15E.

Move one particle from n1 (leaving 1) to n2 (total 2 there): so becomes n1=1 (E), n2=2 (8E), n3=1 (9E). Total comes to E +8E +9E=18E.

Thus, this configuration: 1,2,1. Which for total energy=18E. Then this becomes the second excited state?

Then, which is lower in total energy compared to the other possibility option a) n2 vacated two, leading to 20E. Hence, would 18E be the second excited state?

But this prompts that after the first excited state (15E), promoting a particle from n=1 to the available n=2 (since n=2 can hold another) essentially refills n=2 and depletes n=1. But wait isn't this contradicting the concept that energy input is required to do that? Actually, moving a particle from n=1 (lower energy) to n=2 (higher energy) requires energy input. So, this is a higher energy state.

Wait, but in reality, particles do not lower their energy once excited unless given the chance to emit. But in static configurations (stationary states), these are entirely possible. So, even if you fill particles in higher energy, they are only thinking about total configurations.

But wait, hang on– once you start with the configuration states (as eigenvalues), their energy is additive. Considering that after promoting a particle from n=2 to n=3 (first excited state 2,1,1) versus promoting one from n=1 to n=2 (giving n=1 reduced by one and n=2 increased by one). But in this case the second config raises since moving from lower to higher. So to compare moving particle from n=2 to n3 (ΔE=5 E) or from n1 to n2 (ΔE=3 E). But since the first would have higher energy cost? Wait no.

Wait, when you move a particle from n=2 to n3,...

Wait when arranging the system, initial particles are placed in the lowest energy slots possible. When moving a particle, you need to spend some energy, but in terms of the states, if we list all possible combinations (without considering transition method), En as sum of the particles' positions, sorted by increasing energy.

Alternatively, list all possible configurations where particles are located, and compute E sum for each, order them from low to high. First lowest... Several steps?

Configurations and their total energies:

1. [2,2,0,...] => 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2 +8=10E

2. [2,1,1,0...] =>

   n1:2, n2:1, n3:1 => 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=2+4+9=15E

3. [1,2,1,0…] => n1:1, n2:2, n3:1 => 1*1 +2*4 +1*9=1+8+9=18E

4. [2,0,2,0,...] => n1:2, n2:0, n3:2 =>2*1+0+2*9=2 +0 +18=20E

5. [1,1,2,0...] =>1*1 +1*4 +2*9=1 +4 +18=23E

6. [1,2,0,1...] =>1 +8 +0 +16=25E and others.

But all these configurations. So ordered:10,15,18,20,23,25...

Thus, Ground state:10E

First excited:15E

Second excited:18E

Hence, the energy levels of second excited state is 18E.

Therefore, based on hypothetical configs, first and second excited states.

But the challenge is possible configuration with non-aufbau style filling. Because, normally fermions fill the lowest energy possible. Thus, for lower total energies, but different configurations. But missing here whether differences can be ob_tawsen if we bypass filling.

However for 4 particles, once highest level in ground state is n=2, then moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 (first excitation 15E), and others as higher.

But when you consider the case of promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3( increasing E by 8E) vs... hmm. Depending upon order between 18E and maybe others.

But according to all possibilities arrangement by total energy, the order becomes 10E,15E,18E,...

Therefore, the energies of ground state (10E), first excited state (15E), and second excited state (18E).

Hence the answer.


**Final Answer**
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \boxed{10E}, \boxed{15E}, and \boxed{18E} respectively.
