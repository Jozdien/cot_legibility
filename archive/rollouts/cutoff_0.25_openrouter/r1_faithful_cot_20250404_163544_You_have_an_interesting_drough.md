# Original Question

You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4:

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the impact of each mutation on the gene's protein product. The gene encodes an enzyme required for synthesizing the compound, so a loss-of-function mutation (e.g., truncation) would halt production. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Mutant 1**  
**Change:** CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at codon 3.  
**Effect:** Missense mutation (Leu → Tyr). This alters a single amino acid, potentially affecting protein structure. However, partial enzyme activity might remain, allowing some compound synthesis.  

---

### **Mutant 2**  
**Change:** CTC (Leu) → TAA (stop codon) at codon 3.  
**Effect:** Nonsense mutation introducing a premature stop codon. The resulting protein is truncated after the second amino acid (Met-Phe-*). This almost certainly abolishes enzyme function, preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

---

### **Mutant 3**  
**Changes:**  
- CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at codon 3.  
- ACT (Thr) → GTC (Val) at codon 6.  
**Effect:** Two missense mutations. While these could disrupt enzyme activity, key functional regions (e.g., the active site) might still remain intact, allowing residual compound production.

---

### **Mutant 4**  
**Change:** Deletion of GGT (Gly) at codon 5.  
**Effect:** In-frame deletion of a single amino acid (Gly). If Gly is critical for structure/function, this may impair but not fully abolish enzyme activity. The compound might still be synthesized at reduced levels.

---

### **Conclusion**  
**Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a severely truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound entirely, as the enzyme is not produced in a functional form. 

**Answer:** Mutant 2.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so there's this barley cultivar that's drought-resistant, which is great, but it has an anti-nutritional compound making it unfit for food. They figured out the gene responsible for this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then sequenced the gene in those lines, focusing on the first exon area. We need to figure out which mutation is likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let's go step by step.

First, I need to recall what EMS does. EMS is ethyl methanesulfonate, which typically causes point mutations, specifically alkylating guanine residues, leading to mismatches. It mainly induces G/C to A/T transitions. But sometimes, it can also cause other point mutations depending on the context. So, we're looking for changes in the DNA sequence that would disrupt the gene's function, probably leading to a non-functional protein. If the anti-nutritional compound is produced by this gene, then a loss-of-function mutation would stop its synthesis.

The gene's intact sequence starts with ATG (which is the start codon) followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. The mRNA would be transcribed from this, so the DNA's 5' to 3' is the coding strand. The mRNA would be complementary to this, so mRNA starts with AUG followed by the codons derived from the DNA.

Looking at the mutants. Let's compare each mutant's sequence with the intact one.

Mutant 1:
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Wait, let me check the alignment. The intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTA TTG TCG C... 

Wait, wait, looking more carefully. The original DNA sequence around the problem area is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... The Mutant 1 sequence is TTT CTA CGC TGG... Hmm. So the original has TTT (positions 4-6), then CTC (positions 7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), etc.

In Mutant 1: positions 7-9: CTA instead of CTC. Then next is CGC (positions 10-12) instead of GCT. Wait, no. Wait the actual sequence in the question might need to be looked at exactly.

Original Gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’ (Note in the original question, the mutant 1 seems to have lost a T? Let me check: The original starts with ATG TTT..., Mutant 1 is ATG TTC TAC... So maybe that's where the differences are.

Let me parse this precisely.

Original:

Positions 1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC (because DNA is 5' to 3', so after TTT comes CTC)
10-12: GCT
Then GGT, ACT, etc.

Mutant 1:

Starts with ATG T T C T A C ... Let me break down:

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, actually maybe there's a typo in the question. Because in the original, "Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’". Wait, the original gene is written as ATGTTTCTCGCTGGT..., while mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGT. If we compare:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T...

Breaking into positions:

Original: positions 4-6: TTT (so T at 4, T at 5, T at 6), then position 7-9: CTC (C at 7, T at 8, C at 9)

Mutant 1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T... ?

Wait, perhaps let me count the letters. The intact gene starts with:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...

Which is: ATG followed by TTT (positions 4-6: three Ts), then CTC (positions 7-9: C, T, C), then GCT (positions 10-12: G, C, T), and so on.

Mutant 1: At the beginning, compared to intact:

Intact: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T ACT...

Mutant 1: ATG T T T C T A C G C T G G T...

Wait no, the user's question says Mutant 1 is: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Originally, the first part after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGT...

Mutant 1 is: TTCTACGCTGGT... So, original is T T T C T C G C T G G T... whereas mutant 1 is T T C T A C G C T G G T...

So, at position 6 (if starting from the first T as position 1 after ATG), the original is T (so position 6 is T), Mutant 1 here there's a T at position 5, then C at 6? Wait maybe the alignment is wrong here. Another approach is to write out the sequences.

Wait, the intact DNA sequence (coding strand) is:

5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Mutant 1:

5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’

So compare position by position:

Positions 1-3: ATG same.

Positions 4-6: original is T-T-T, mutant is T-T-C. So at position 6 in the original (third T) it's now C in mutant 1. So, TTT → TTC.

Positions 7-9: original is CTC, mutant is TAC. Wait, that's a bigger change. Wait wait. Positions 7-9 in original: CTC. In mutant 1 it's TAC. That is, the first codon after TTT becomes TAC instead of CTC.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me list codons correctly. From the intact gene:

- The sequence starts at ATG (start codon), so:

Coding DNA: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Transcribed into mRNA (complementary, replacing T with U):

AUG UUU CUA GCG GGU ACU UCU GUG GAU GAA CAU AUU UAU UGU CGU ... UGA

Which translates to amino acids:

Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu - His - Ile - Tyr - Cys - Arg ... Stop

Now Mutant 1 coding DNA:

ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

So, the DNA is different starting at the 4th nucleotide. Wait, if ATG (1-3), then in intact gene, next is TTT (positions 4-6); in Mutant 1, the next three nucleotides after ATG are TTC (positions4-6), then TAC (positions7-9), then GCT (positions10-12), etc.

Original codons (positions 4-6, 7-9):

TTT CTC GCT GGT...

Mutant 1:

TTC TAC GCT GGT...

So first codon after ATG in original: TTT → Phe. After mutant 1: TTC → still Phe (since TTC is also Phe).

Then the next codon: original CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr).

Then next codon GCT (Ala) stays the same.

So the mutation in Mutant 1 changes the second codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). That's a missense mutation, replacing Leu with Tyr. Whether this affects the protein function depends on where in the protein this occurs, but perhaps such a substitution might alter the protein structure. However, the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. Maybe the gene encodes an enzyme necessary for synthesizing the compound. If the enzyme's active site is disrupted, the compound won’t be made. But if this mutation only changes a Leu to Tyr in the N-terminal region, perhaps early in the gene, maybe this doesn't completely knock out the enzyme's function. Maybe other mutations would be more severe.

Mutant 2:

Mm. Original sequence: at positions 7-9 is CTC, Mutant 2 has TAA?

From the user's description: Mutant 2's sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So after ATG in the intact gene, next is TTTCTC... In Mutant 2: after ATG, TTC TAA GCT...

Thus:

Original codons:

1-3: ATG (Met)

4-6: TTT (Phe)

7-9: CTC (Leu)

10-12: GCT (Ala)

Mutant 2:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTC (Phe), same as in Mutant 1?

Wait, let me check:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

So positions 4-6: TTC (still Phe, same as Mutant 1)

Positions 7-9: TAA -> So that would be TAA in DNA. When transcribed, mRNA would be TAA (complementary is AUU in mRNA if the coding strand) Wait, wait. Since DNA is written 5' to 3', the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T vs U. So DNA codons here (Mutant2 positions7-9): TAA would be the coding strand. So when transcribed into mRNA, it's UAA. The ribosome reads mRNA, so codon UAA is a stop codon. Thus, Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon at position 7-9 (second codon after Met), so the protein would be truncated after the second amino acid (Phe). That would be a nonsense mutation leading to a severely truncated protein. If the gene product is an enzyme required to make the anti-nutritional compound, a premature stop codon would knock out its function. So this is likely a loss-of-function mutation, which would lead to no enzyme, and thus no compound. This is a possible candidate for eliminating the compound.

Mutant 3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, intact had ATG TTT TCT CGC ... Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ... hmm.

Original sequence:

Positions after ATG: TTT (positions4-6), TCT (positions7-9) in DNA. Wait, original:

Wait original gene as given is:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, breaking that down:

ATG TTTCTC GCT ... So perhaps groupings after ATG:

Original sequence after ATG: T T T C T C G C T ... i.e., positions 4-6: TTC, but not sure. Maybe need to line them up correctly.

Actually:

- The original sequence: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T ... TGA

Augh, this is getting confusing. Let me recast using underscores to break into codons (triplets):

Intact gene (coding DNA):

5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA-3’

So codons:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. CTC (Leu)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
11. CAT (His)
12. ATT (Ile)
13. TAT (Tyr)
14. TGT (Cys)
15. CGT (Arg)
...

Now, Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breakdown after ATG:

At the start of mutant3: ATG followed by TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...

Compare that to original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

So see:

Original: TTT (positions4-6), CTC (positions7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), etc.

Mutant3: Here, after ATG:

T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T ... Hmm. Wait, probably mistyped here. Let me check exactly the original mutant3 sequence as provided.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, written as:AT G TTT TAC GCT G GTG TCA C ... Compare to original after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TC...

In codons:

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Original:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So codons:

Original codons 2: Phe (TTT), 3: Leu (CTC), 4: Ala (GCT), 5: Gly (GGT), 6: Thr (ACT), 7: Ser (TCT)...

Mutant3 codons 2: TTT (Phe). Codon3: TAC (Tyr). Then codon4: GCT (Ala) same as original. codon5: GGT (Gly) same. But then codon6 is GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr) in original. Then codon7: ACT (Thr) instead of TCT (Ser). 

So mutations here:

Original codon3 CTC (Leu) → mutant is TAC (Tyr). So missense.

Original codon6 ACT (Thr) → mutant has GTC (Val). How? Wait position codon6: original ACT becomes GTC, which requires changing A to G and T to C in the DNA. Wait, but EMS causes mainly G→A or C→T transitions, not necessarily A→G.

Wait, wait. The original ACT is DNA coding strand. The mRNA codon would be ACU (Thr). Mutant codon would be GTC (DNA) → mRNA GUC (Val). So the DNA mutations here: A → G in first position, T → C in third position.

A→G would be a transition (purine to purine). T→C is also a transition (pyrimidine to pyrimidine). However, in EMS-induced mutations, primarily they cause G to A or C to T as EMS tends to alkylate guanine, leading to mispairing with thymine. So these changes A to G and T to C might not be typical EMS mutations. Alternatively, perhaps in the complementary strand. Maybe, but let's think. If the DNA of the coding strand is mutated to have GTC instead of ACT, that's a possible change. But even if the mutation is in the coding strand, original was ACT (so complementary is TGA), if EMS acts on a G, in the complementary strand, alkylating it, then during replication the G (complementary to C in coding strand) might pair with T, possible ? 

But maybe this is complicating. Anyway, focusing on the effect: two amino acid changes. The third codon changes from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC), and the sixth codon changes from Thr (ACT) to Val (GTC), possibly. Additionally, exon structure can matter. Wait, the first exon is the area here. But in any case, if the gene's product's function is destroyed, these mutations might contribute. But perhaps two missense mutations could disrupt enzyme function. But a single nonsense mutation (like in Mutant 2) would more surely knock out the gene.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original sequence: After ATG: TTTCTC... if we compare with mutant4:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG G...

So writing out:

Mutant4: After ATG, codons:

2. TTT (Phe) same as original.

But next: in original, codon3 CTC (Leu), here mutant4's codon3 is TAC (Tyr), so that's a missense (similar to Mutant3 codon3). Then mutant4's codon4 GCT (Ala) same as original. Then codon5 ACT instead of GGT in original, codon5 becomes ACT (Thr instead of Gly). Wait, no:

Original codon4: GCT (Ala). Mutant4 follows GCT (Ala) with ACT, so codon5 in original was GGT (Gly), but in Mutant4, after GCT comes ACT (Thr). Therefore, there’s deletion?

But Mutant4's sequence is written as:

Original: ATG TTTCTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: ATG TTTTAC GCT ACT TCT GTGGAT...

Wait, let's check:

Original nucleotides after ATG: TTTCTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Count letters:

After ATG, first 12 nucleotides: T T T C T C G C T G G T (3+3+3+3=12, as codons 2-5)

Mutant4: According to the given sequence, it's written as ATG T T T T A C G C T A CTT CT... etc., but not exactly. The user's given Mutant4 sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So starting after ATG:

TTTTAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the first codon after ATG is TTT (Phe) same as original.

Then what? Next in original, after TTT is CTC GCT GGT...

In Mutant4: after TTT comes TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

Wait, the issue is the intact gene has between codons 2 (TTT) and 3 (CTC), but Mutant4's sequence after TTT is TAC, which would be codon3: TAC (Tyr). Then codon4: GCT (same as original codon4). So this skips codon3's original CTC, but the issue here is that the overall length may have changed. Wait, maybe there's a deletion. Let's compare exact sequences.

Intact from ATG onwards (until part before ...):

Original:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So after ATG:

Original: TTT [CTC GCT GGT ACT] TCT...

Mutant4: TTT [TAC GCT ACT] TCT...

So they're missing the 'GGT' that is part of codon5 in original (GGT/ Gly), and instead have ACT at that position. So the GGT is missing. Comparing the sequences, maybe there's a deletion. For instance, in the original, after "GCT", the next nucleotides are GGT. In Mutant4, after "GCT" comes ACT. So Deletion of GGT's G and perhaps a G, leading to a frameshift? Wait, no. Let's check from the DNA sequence perspective.

Original after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Position after ATG (starting at 1):

Positions 4-6: TTT (codon2: Phe)

7-9: CTC (codon3: Leu)

10-12: GCT (codon4: Ala)

13-15: GGT (codon5: Gly)

16-18: ACT (codon6: Thr)

19-21: TCT (codon7: Ser)

Mutant4:

After ATG: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Codons2: TTT (Phe, same)

Codon3: TAC (Tyr, mt)

Codon4: GCT (Ala, same)

Codon5: ACT (Thr, codon6 in original)

Codon6: TCT (Ser, same as original codon7)

So here, the codon5 is ACT (original codon6) instead of GGT. Thus, there's a deletion of the GGT (positions13-15 in original). How many nucleotides are missing? Let's count the distance.

From original, after TTT CAC GCT GGT ACT...

Mu4: TTT TAC GCT ACT...

So between GCT (positions10-12) and ACT (original’s positions16-18), there was a GGT (positions13-15). Mu4 skips GGT. So removing GGT. That’s 3 nucleotides deleted. Therefore, the DNA has a three-nucleotide deletion (codon5 missing). That causes a deletion of the GGT (Gly) at codon5. This is a in-frame deletion. So the resulting protein would be missing one amino acid (Gly) at position5, but the rest of the sequence would be intact. If this Gly is important for the enzyme's structure or active site, losing it might affect function. However, it's possible that the enzyme loses some function but maybe retains partial activity. Alternatively, given that some exon boundaries are maintained (the mutation is in the first exon), it depends on where this deletion occurs. However, missing one amino acid might not completely inactivate the enzyme. Frameshift or early stop codons are more disruptive.

Now we need to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound.

Mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon (TAA in DNA, so UAA in mRNA) at codon3. That means the protein is just Met-Phe-*, truncated very early. That would likely completely disrupt the gene's product. Without the enzyme, the anti-nutritional compound can't be synthesized. Thus, Mutant2 would likely be the candidate.

The other mutants have missense mutations or in-frame deletions. These could alter the protein's function, but maybe not entirely abolish it. If the anti-nutritional compound requires the enzyme to have some key residues further along the protein, a truncated gene product would not have them. Meanwhile, the stop codon early on would result in a non-functional protein. Therefore, Mutant2's mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound.

Okay, so there's this barley cultivar that's drought-resistant, which is great, but it has an anti-nutritional compound making it unfit for food. They figured out the gene responsible for this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then sequenced the gene in those lines, focusing on the first exon area.

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTA TTG TCG C... 

Wait, wait, looking more carefully. The original DNA sequence around the problem area is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... The Mutant 1 sequence is TTT CTA CGC TGG... Hmm. So the original has TTT (positions 4-6), then CTC (positions 7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), etc.

In Mutant 1: positions 7-9: CTA instead of CTC. Then next is CGC (positions 10-12) instead of GCT. Wait, no. Wait the actual sequence in the question might need to be looked at exactly.

So, at position 6 (if starting from the first T as position 1 after ATG), the original is T (so position 6 is T), Mutant 1 here there's a T at position 5, then C at 6? Wait maybe the alignment is wrong here. Another approach is to write out the sequences.

Wait, the intact D

# Anthropic completion

Alright, so there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar that contains an anti-nutritional compound making it unsuitable for consumption. Researchers have identified the gene responsible for producing this compound. The gene's structure consists of five exons and four introns. To address this issue, they employed EMS mutagenesis to create mutant lines and then sequenced the gene in these mutants, with particular attention to the first exon region. Our task is to determine which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

To begin with, I should recall what EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) does. EMS typically induces point mutations by alkylating guanine residues, which leads to mismatches. It primarily causes G/C to A/T transitions, although it can occasionally cause other types of point mutations depending on the context. We're searching for DNA sequence changes that would disrupt the gene's function, probably resulting in a non-functional protein. If this gene is responsible for producing the anti-nutritional compound, a loss-of-function mutation would prevent its synthesis.

The intact gene sequence begins with ATG (the start codon) followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT and ends with TGA. The DNA's 5' to 3' direction represents the coding strand. The mRNA would be transcribed from this, beginning with AUG followed by codons derived from the DNA sequence.

Now let's examine the mutants by comparing each mutant sequence with the intact one.

For Mutant 1:
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Let me check the alignment more carefully. Breaking the intact sequence into codons:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

For Mutant 1, when aligned:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTA TTG TCG C...

Looking at the original DNA sequence around the area of interest:
TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

And in Mutant 1:
TTT CTA CGC TGG...

So in the original, positions 4-6 are TTT, positions 7-9 are CTC, positions 10-12 are GCT, positions 13-15 are GGT, and so on.

In Mutant 1, there's a change at positions 7-9 from CTC to CTA, and also at positions 10-12 from GCT to CGC.

Let me parse this precisely to ensure accuracy.

Original gene: 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'

Breaking into triplets:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1: 5'-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3'

Sure, here's the rephrased text:

So, there's a barley cultivar that is resistant to drought, which is fantastic, but it contains an anti-nutritional compound, making it unsuitable for consumption. Researchers have identified the gene responsible for producing this compound. This gene is comprised of five exons and four introns. To generate mutants, they employed EMS mutagenesis and subsequently sequenced the gene in these lines, paying close attention to the first exon section. Our task is to determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let's proceed step by step.

Firstly, it's important to understand what EMS does. EMS stands for ethyl methanesulfonate, which usually introduces point mutations by alkylating guanine residues, causing mismatches. Typically, it leads to G/C to A/T transitions, though it may also induce other types of point mutations depending on the context. We are looking for changes in the DNA sequence that could disrupt the function of the gene, potentially resulting in a non-functional protein. If the gene is responsible for the production of the anti-nutritional compound, then a null mutation would prevent its synthesis.

The gene's original sequence begins with ATG (the start codon) followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA. The mRNA transcribed from this sequence implies that the DNA's 5' to 3' direction represents the coding strand. Hence, the mRNA will be the complement, beginning with AUG and following the DNA-derived codons.

Examining the mutants, let's compare each mutant's sequence to the unchanged one.

Mutant 1:
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Now, let’s verify the alignment. The intact sequence is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1 sequence: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTA TTG TCG C...

Looking closer, the original DNA sequence around the altered region is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT... In Mutant 1, this has changed to TTT CTA CGC TGG... Reviewing the breakdown, the original includes TTT (positions 4-6), followed by CTC (positions 7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), and so on.

For Mutant 1: positions 7-9: it has CTA rather than CTC. The subsequent sequence is CGC (positions 10-12) as opposed to GCT. Let's re-evaluate to ensure accuracy.

Original Gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’ (It seems, in the original context, Mutant 1 might be missing a T. To clarify: the original starts with ATG TTT..., whereas Mutant 1 begins with ATG TTC TAC...)

Let’s analyze this correctly.

Original Sequence:

Positions 1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC (since DNA is read 5' to 3', these follow TTT)
10-12: GCT
Subsequently GGT, ACT, and so forth.

Mutant 1 starts as ATG T T C T A C ... Let's break it down:

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Actually, there may be a typographical error in the question itself. In the original statement, it claims Mutant 1 is: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’ and the unchanged gene is described as ATGTTTCTCGCTGGT..., but Mutant 1 appears as ATGTTCTACGCTGGT.

Comparing directly:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T...

For accuracy:

Original: Positions 4-6: TTT, followed by position 7-9: CTC

Mutant 1: ATG T T T C T A C G C T G G T...

Thus, Mutant 1 at position 6 seems to have switched from a T in the original to a C. If the alignment does seem off, writing the sequences might help verify discrepancies...

The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, ideally through a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift leading to a severely truncated protein. \n\n### Analysis of Mutants:\n1. **Mutant 1**  \n   - **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu) in exon 1 (synonymous) and GCT (Ala) → CGC (Arg) (missense).  \n   - **Effect**: A missense mutation alters a single amino acid but does not guarantee loss of function. The synonymous mutation has no effect.  \n   - **Conclusion**: Unlikely to eliminate the compound.\n\n2. **Mutant 2**  \n   - **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → TAA in exon 1.  \n   - **Effect**: TAA is a stop codon in mRNA (UAA). This introduces a premature termination after the second codon (Phe), truncating the protein early in translation.  \n   - **Conclusion**: Likely results in a nonfunctional protein, eliminating the compound. **Best candidate**.\n\n3. **Mutant 3**  \n   - **Mutation**: Insertion of an extra T in the first exon, causing a frameshift.  \n   - **Effect**: Alters the reading frame downstream, leading to a jumbled amino acid sequence. While frameshifts can cause truncation if a stop codon is encountered, the effect here is less predictable than a direct stop codon.  \n   - **Conclusion**: Potentially disruptive but less definitive than Mutant 2.\n\n4. **Mutant 4**  \n   - **Mutation**: Deletion of the GGT (Gly) triplet in exon 1, resulting in an in-frame loss of one amino acid.  \n   - **Effect**: Loss of a single residue may not fully inactivate the protein unless the deleted glycine is critical for function.  \n   - **Conclusion**: Less likely to eliminate the compound compared to Mutant 2.\n\n### Key Reasoning:\n- **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) in the first exon, leading to a severely truncated protein (Met-Phe-Stop). This guarantees loss of function, preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.  \n- Frameshifts (Mutant 3) and in-frame deletions (Mutant 4) are less definitive, while missense mutations (Mutant 1) are insufficient for complete inactivation.\n\n**Answer**: Mutant 2", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning='Na is:\n\n5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T ...

Let\'s see:\n\nOriginal positions from start codon (ATG is position 1-3). Then position 4: T, 5: T, 6: T, 7: C, 8: T, 9: C, 10: G, 11: C, 12: T, etc.\n\nMutant 1:\n\nPosition 4: T, 5: T, 6: T turns to... Wait, maybe they lost a T? Wait wait, the original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCT..., so the first few nucleotides after ATG are TTTCTCGCT...\n\nMutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCT... So after ATG, it\'s TTC TAC GCT...\n\nComparing:\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T...\n\nMutant 1: T T C T A C G C T...\n\nWait, here\'s the issue: In the original sequence, the nucleotides after ATG are TTT (positions 4-6) then CTC (positions 7-9). In mutant 1, they are TTC (positions 4-6: T, T, C) followed by TAC (positions 7-9: T, A, C). So, replacing TTT CTC with TTC TAC. That would mean Position 6 is changed from T to C (in TTC). Then position 7 is C to T (but wait, original had C at position 7, is that right?)\n\nWait, maybe the actual nucleotides need to be considered step by step.\n\nOriginal (from 5\' to 3\' after ATG):\n\nPositions: 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15...\n\nBases:      T T T C T C G C T G G T...\n\nMutant1 after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-6: TTC (instead of TTT), then TAC (positions 7-9: T A C instead of CTC).\n\nSo, position 6: T→C (changing T to C). Positions 7-9: Original CTC becomes T A C. Wait, that is, position 7: C→T, position 8: T→A, position 9: C→C. Wait, maybe there\'s a better way.\n\nOriginal sequence at positions 4-15:\n\nATG T T T C T C G C T G G T ACT...\n\nSo positions 4: T, 5: T, 6: T; positions 7: C, 8: T, 9: C; positions 10: G, 11: C, 12: T; 13: G, 14: G, 15: T.\n\nIn Mutant 1, after ATG: T T C T A C G C T G G T ACT...\n\nSo position 4: T, 5: T, 6: C (instead of T), positions 7: T, 8: A, 9: C (positions 7-9 are TAC instead of CTC). So here, there\'s a point mutation at position 6 (T→C), and a mutation at position 7 (C→T) and position 8 (T→A)? No, wait: To have TAC at positions 7-9, it would mean that the original CTC (positions 7-9) is changed to TAC. Let\'s break it down:\n\nOriginal triplet CTC (positions 7-9): C (7), T (8), C (9)\n\nMutant1 triplet TAC: T (7), A (8), C (9)\n\nSo position 7: C → T (transversion?), position 8: T→ A.\n\nThis would be two point mutations in adjacent nucleotides, turning CTC to TAC. That\'s possible? Alternatively, perhaps there\'s a deletion or insertion? But looking at the overall sequence lengths... Let\'s check the lengths of all mutants. The answer options have varying sequences. But the question says that in mutant 4, there\'s a shorter sequence: "ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’"—so here, perhaps the GGT is missing (the original had GCTGGTACT, whereas mutant4 has ACTTCT..., maybe a deletion of some bases. Hmm.)\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alignment isn\'t exact when there\'s a deletion. But in Mutant1, if positions 6-9 have changed from TCTC to CTAC. Wait, no, the alignment is more precise as: Original first exon after ATG has:\n\nPositions (after ATG, so starting at position 1 as the first T): \n\n1: T, 2: T, 3: T, 4: C, etc.\n\nNo, maybe not. Let\'s index each base after the ATG. Let\'s number the entire gene starting at 1.\n\nOriginal gene sequences:\n\n1-3: ATG\n\n4: T, 5: T, 6: T\n\n7: C, 8: T, 9: C\n\n10: G, 11: C, 12: T\n\n13: G, 14: G, 15: T, etc.\n\nMutant 1:\n\nAfter ATG (positions1-3: ATG), then:\n\n4: T, 5: T, 6: C\n\n7: T, 8: A, 9: C\n\n10: G, 11: C, 12: T\n\nposition13 onwards same as in original. So mutations at positions6 (T→C), 7 (C→T), 8 (T→A). Wait, but that\'s three consecutive changes? That seems more like a possible deletion or maybe a SNP in three consecutive bases. But EMS typically causes point mutations. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe this is a frameshift or a small deletion. Alternatively, perhaps there\'s a typo in the sequence as presented in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant1 is only one base change. Wait, looking again:\n\nOriginal: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...\n\nMutant1: ...TTTCTACGCTGGTACT...\n\nOriginal in this region: T T T C T C G C T G G T A...\n\nMutant1: T T T C T A C G C T G G T A...\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe the original is CT-CGC-TGG (using spaces for clarity), so the difference is in the third base of the CTx triplet. Let me line them up:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant1: TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC...\n\nWait, maybe this is a rage. Let\'s code each triplet:\n\nOriginal:\nTTT (positions 4-6) → Phe (F)\nCTC (7-9) → Leu (L)\nGCT (10-12) → Ala (A)\nGGT (13-15) → Gly (G)\nACT (16-18) → Thr (T)\n... etc.\n\nMutant1:\nTTT (same)\nCTA (CT-A at positions7-9) → Leu (L; since CTA is also Leu)\nCGC (10-12) → Arg (R)\n...GGT becomes TGG? Wait, no, original was GCT (positions10-12: G C T) which becomes CGC (C G C) in mutant1? \n\nWait in the original: positions10-12 are G C T → GCT (Ala)\n\nIn Mutant1: positions10-12 are C G C → CGC (Arg)\n\nSo, here after the first TTT, the original is CTC (Leu) followed by GCT (Ala), and in Mutant1, it\'s CTA (Leu) and CGC (Arg). So positions7-9: CTC → CTA (Leu to Leu; synonymous mutation) but positions10-12: GCT (Ala) → CGC (Arg). That would be a missense mutation.\n\nSo in mutant1, the amino acid changes from Leu-Ala to Leu-Arg. That\'s a non-synonymous mutation but not necessarily a frameshift or nonsense. If GCT (Ala) becomes CGC (Arg), it\'s a substitution. So this would just change an amino acid. Depending on where that is in the protein, it could affect function, but it\'s possible ESΜ could cause that. But would that eliminate the anti-nutritional compound? Possibly, but maybe not. The required mutation could be a nonsense mutation, which introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein, which may lose function. So if the protein is not made properly, perhaps the compound isn\'t synthesized.\n\nSimilarly, let\'s look at the other mutants.\n\nMutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT...\n\nMutant2 after ATG: TTC TAA GCT GGT...\n\nBreaking into triplets:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT → Phe Leu Ala Gly\n\nMutant2: TTC TAA GCT GGT → Phe STOP ... if TAA is the triplet. TAA is a stop codon.\n\nBecause TAA is a stop codon in the standard genetic code. So if positions7-9 in mutant2 are TAA instead of CTC (from original), that inserts a premature stop codon. Original was CTC (position7-9) in the middle of exon 1. If it becomes TAA, then the mRNA would be TAA, which is a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. So that would likely result in a non-functional protein. Hence, this mutation (Mutant2) would lead to a premature termination, thus preventing the production of the anti-nutritional compound. So this is a possible candidate.\n\nMutant3:\n\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGA...\n\nMutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGA...\n\nBreaking down. After ATG:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nMutant3: TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA CTT CTG TGG ...\n\nWait, perhaps here there\'s an insertion?\n\nOriginal is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT -> so the next after GGT is ACT TCT... etc.\n\nMutant3 is TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA CTT CTG TGG... So the fourth base after ATG is an extra T? So in position4, there\'s T added? So from original T T T C T C G C T... Is it inserting a T? Or alternatively, in mutant3, the sequence starts as ATG T T T T A C G C..., so on position4, there\'s an extra T.\n\nBut let me align them more carefully. The original:\n\nAfter ATG: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...\n\nMutant3: T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T...\n\nSo inserting an extra T (or inserting an extra T at position 4) causes a frameshift. Let\'s see: After the original triplet TTT (positions4-6), comes CTC (positions7-9). In mutant3, after inserting a T, you\'d get positions4-6 as T T T, but then the next base is T again. So inserting a T at position4 would shift everything after, leading to a different reading frame. Frameshift mutations typically lead to a completely altered amino acid sequence downstream and often result in premature stop codons. So if mutant3 has an insertion of a T, that would cause a frameshift and possible truncation. But examining the sequence given:\n\nOriginal: comparing to mutant3:\nOriginal sequence after ATG: starts TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\nMutant3: starts TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA...\n\nWait, original after ATG: positions4-15:\n\n4-6: TTT,\n\n7-9: CTC,\n\n10-12: GCT,\n\n13-15: GGT,\n\n16-18: ACT,\n\n19-21: TCT,\n\n...\n\nMutant3:\n\nATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A...\n\nWait position4-7: TTTT AC...\n\nThus, original positions4-6: TTT; Mutant3 adds another T, making TTTT (positions4-7: TTTT), but this is viewed as triplet: TTT TAC...? So, the first four nucleotides after ATG are TTTT A..., meaning triplet T T T (positions4-6, same as before), but then an extra T at position7. But actually, the way it\'s written in the problem, mutant3 is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ compared to the original 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.\n\nSo, in the original, after the initial TTT, next is C T C G...\n\nIn mutant3, after TTT is T A C G...\n\nWait, it\'s inserting a T? Let\'s count:\n\nOriginal: ATG T T T C T C G C T...\n\nMutant3: ATG T T T T A C G C T...\n\nSo inserting a T after the third T (position6?), making TTTT A... So triplet becomes TTT (positions4-6), TTA (positions7-9). Compare to original\'s TTT (positions4-6) and CTC (positions7-9). So insertion of a T between position6 and7 (original position6 was T, but after that, a T is inserted, making TTTT). This causes a frameshift mutation. Because inserting one nucleotide shifts the reading frame. So triplet positions7-9 become TTA (Leucine) instead of CTC (Leucine), but from that point onward, the entire reading frame is altered. This would change all subsequent codons, and the protein could be truncated if a premature stop codon is encountered. However, a frameshift mutation could lead to a non-functional protein, which might be what we want. But sometimes, the protein could be longer if the stop codon is later, but the sequence would be jumbled. Possibly, this may disrupt the gene product. But frameshifts can have various effects. However, depending on where the frameshift occurs, this might not introduce a stop codon immediately but just a different amino acid sequence. So the effect depends on the exact location. Nonetheless, it\'s a possibility.\n\nMutant4:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal:\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...\nMutant4:\nATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG ...\n\nSo comparing:\n\nOriginal after ATG:\n\nTTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant4 after ATG:\n\nTTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...\n\nSo, they have deleted some nucleotides here. Let\'s check. In the original, positions 7-15: CTC GCT GGT ACT.\n\nMutant4 skips GGT: sequences at mutant4 are TAC GCT ACT. Missing the GGT which was in the original. Let me line up:\n\nOriginal exon1 part:\n\n...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...\n\nMutant4:\n\n...TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...\n\nSo, in Original, after TTT (positions4-6) comes CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nIn Mutant4, TTT is followed by TAC GCT ACT... So comparing:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions7-9: CTC,\n\n10-12: GCT,\n\n13-15: GGT,\n\n16-18: ACT...\n\nMutant4 positions7-9: TAC,\n\n10-12: GCT,\n\n13-15: ACT...\n\nSo Original segment CTC GCT GGT ACT is replaced with TAC GCT ACT. So the GGT triplet (positions13-15) is missing. There\'s a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT), perhaps. Alternatively, cell签证ed for DNA:\n\nFrom the DNA sequences, original: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT... which would be CT DNA strand part. Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT... Hence, there\'s a possible deletion of the GGT triplet. If exactly three nucleotides are deleted, it\'s an in-frame deletion, leading to loss of one amino acid (Glycine, given GGT is Gly). If that\'s the case, in the mutant, the protein would be missing one amino acid. This could affect protein function, but some in-frame deletions allow the protein to be made but alter its function, depending on where the deletion occurs. However, if the gene\'s activity requires that region, then this might reduce or eliminate the production of the compound. But compared to a premature stop codon causing truncation, an in-frame deletion might not be as effective. However, depending on what part of the protein is deleted, it could be critical.\n\nNow, to answer the question: we need to pick which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The gene\'s product is synthesizing the compound; if the gene is knocked out (nonfunctional), the compound shouldn\'t be made. The optimal mutation would be one that leads to a nonfunctional protein, such as a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) or a frameshift leading to a truncated protein. Synonymous mutations (silent) won\'t affect. Missense might reduce function, but depends.\n\nLooking at the mutants:\n\nMutant1: Positions7-9 CTC→CTA (which is still leucine, synonymous), and then GCT→CGC (Ala→Arg) (missense). So two point mutations. But why are there two mutations close by? Since EMS generally causes point mutations, not double mutations, but I guess possible.\n\nMutant2 has CTC→TAA, which introduces a stop codon. That would result in truncation early in the protein. If the stop codon occurs in the first exon, the protein is very short. Assuming the original gene starts with ATG followed by coding exons. The TAA at positions7-9 (of mRNA) would mean the protein is only a few amino acids in length. This almost certainly inactivates the enzyme, as it\'s cut short early on.\n\nMutant3 has an insertion of a nucleotide, causing a frameshift. As a result, the reading frame shifts after the insertion, leading to a different amino acid sequence and potentially a premature stop codon. However, in the case of Mutant3, the mutation occurs after inserting a T, let\'s confirm:\n\nOriginal sequence: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant3 sequence: ATG TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA... So inserting a T after the first three Ts. So the first three codons are ATG TTT TAC... wait that doesn\'t fit. Breaking it into triplets:\n\nOriginal alignment after frameshift: \n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nMutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GT C T G TGG...\n\nWait, actually with the inserted T (making four Ts), so after the start codon, we have TTTT, so the first codon is ATG (start), next is TTT (same as original), then TAC (insertion causes the fourth T to pair with the next two bases? Let\'s see:\n\nOriginal after ATG:\n\nTTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant3 after ATG:\n\nTTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA CTT...\n\nBreaking into triplets starts from the first T:\n\nMutant3:\nPositions4-6: TTT\nPosition7-9: TAC (T, additional T inserted? Wait, the insertion might be of a nucleotide, making the sequence one longer, thus the frame shifts by one. For example, original sequence is:\n\nATG T1 T2 T3 C4 T5 C6 G7 C8 T9 G10 G11 T12 etc.\n\nMutant3 inserts an extra T after T3, making:\n\nATG T1 T2 T3 T4 A5 C6 G7 C8 T9 G10 etc.\n\nThus, s pairwise:\n\nOriginal frame after ATG:\n\nTTT (codon1: Phe), CTC (codon2: Leu), GCT (codon3: Ala), GGT (codon4: Gly), etc.\n\nMutant3:\n\nTTT (codon1: Phe), TAC (codon2: Tyr), GCT (codon3: Ala), GGT (codon4: Gly?), no wait, depends on the actual insertion. Since the inserted T shifts the frame, the second codon is T T T (no—it\'s shifted by one). If inserting an extra T at position4 (after T3), the sequence becomes T T T T A C G C T... Then the triplet align becomes:\n\nCodon1: T T T (Phe)\n\nCodon2: T T A (Leu)\n\nCodon3: C G C (Arg)\n\nCodon4: T G G (Trp?)\n\nWait, no, in DNA sequence direction is such that after ATG the sequence is forward. Wait, maybe using frame shifts would be difficult here. Let\'try this step by step:\n\nOriginal after ATG:\n... T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...\nIndices:4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18...\n\nWith the three Ts (positions4-6: TTT).\n\nMutant3 has an extra T inserted at position7. So now after the three Ts (positions4-6), there\'s an extra T at position7, making:\n\n... T T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T ...\n\nWait no, no—Mutant3 sequence is written as "5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’".\n\nSo after ATG TTTT ACGCT etc. So:\n\nATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A ...\n\nThus, the codons would be:\n\nATG (start) then:\n\nFirst codon after ATG: TTT (positions4-6: unchanged)\n\nSecond codon: (positions7-9) TAC (inserted T at position7 makes this TAC)\n\nThird codon: (positions10-12: GCT same as original but shifted due to insertion\n\nWait perhaps not. Let\'s consider:\n\nAfter ATG, the original was:\n\npositions4-6: T T T (codon1: TTT, Phe)\n\n positions7-9: C T C (codon2: CTC, Leu)\n\n positions10-12: G C T (codon3: GCT, Ala)\n\n positions13-15: G G T (codon4: GGT, Gly)\n\nIn mutant3, inserting an extra T between positions6 and7 (after the three Ts) leads to:\n\npositions4-6: T T T (codon1: Phe)\n\npositions7-9: T A C (codon2: TAC, Thr)\n\nWait, no. DNA is read in triplets. So after inserting a T, everything shifts. Original positions after3 Ts are CTC GCT GGT...\n\nAfter inserting a T (after position6), the sequence would become T T T T C T C G C T, etc. So:\n\n positions4-6: T T T → same.\n\n positions7-9: T C T → TCT, Ser.\n\n position10-12: C G C → CGC, Arg\n\netc. Wait, no: Actually, inserting a T between positions6 and7:\n\nDNA sequence becomes (with inserted T as position7a):\n\n positions:\n\n4: T, 5:T,6:T,7a:T (inserted), 7:C,8:T,9:C,10:G, etc.\n\nSo the triplet after T T T becomes T (inserted), C, T (codon becomes T C T -> TCT, Ser), then next triplet is C G C (CGC, Arg), etc. The rest shifts.\n\nSo the result is that after the Phe (TTT), the next codon is Ser (TCT), replacing the original Leu (CTC). Then the next is Arg (CGC instead of Ala GCT). This seems like a frameshift alters reading frame starting at codon2. But despite this, the length of the codons remains the same (except for the shifted frame). Depending on where a STOP codon is encountered, there might be an early truncation, but I can\'t tell immediately without knowing whether the shifted frame contains a stop codon soon. Regardless, frameshifts often lead to nonfunctional proteins. This mutation may truncate the protein, which would help.\n\nMutant4: has a deletion of a triplet (likely), causing loss of Gly (GGT). So if three nucleotides are deleted (GGT), it\'s an in-frame mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Gly). Depending on where that glycine is in the protein structure (e.g., if it\'s in a critical active site or structural position), this could inactivate the enzyme. However, single amino acid deletions can be less disruptive than truncations. Though for example, deleting a residue in an essential part could be dysfunctional.\n\nLooking back at the options, which mutant is most likely to eliminate the compound. If the gene product is an enzyme, nonsense mutations (like Mutant2 introducing a premature stop) would terminate translation early. That is a classic loss-of-function mutation, resulting in a nonfunctional enzyme. Thus,Truncated enzyme cannot catalyze the biosynthesis of the compound. This would eliminate the antinutritional compound.\n\nMutant2: the mutation is in the first exon, early on, producing a premature stop codon. Thus, this is the most likely candidate. The TAA is a stop codon. In the DNA sequence, the original (positions7-9) sequence is CTC (coding strand), so in mRNA it would be GAG. In Mutant2, the coding DNA sequence is TAA, mRNA would be AUА (I think there may be confusion here DNA to mRNA). Wait: Let\'s think again. DNA is double-stranded. Since the DNA is given as 5\'-ATG...3\', then the coding strand is this sequence (as mRNA is complementary to the DNA template strand and same as the coding strand). Therefore, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA sequence (but with U replacing T). Wait no: DNA to mRNA: the mRNA is synthesized using the DNA template strand (antisense), so the mRNA sequence is complementary to the template and same as the coding strand (if the coding strand is the sense strand).\n\nGiven that the original DNA is written as 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’, presumably this is the coding (sense) strand, so mRNA would be complementary: starting with ATG->AUG, TTT-> AAA, CTC→GAG...\n\nBut in Mutant2, the codon at positions7-9, originally CTC, DNA is TAA in mutant2. So the coding DNA is a?Ligner\'s:\n\nMutant2:\n\nAfter ATG, (DNA: T T C T A A...). \n\nCoding DNA for Mutant2 in position7 throuh9: TAA.\n\nSo the mRNA would be complementary, so the mRNA at these positions would be AUU?, but no. Wait, DNA sequence is given as 5\'-ATG TTC TAA GCT... (in the first part). So the coding sequence for positions7-9 is TAA. The mRNA would be complementary to the template strand, so template DNA strand would have ATT here (since coding DNA has TAA (5\' T A A 3\')) then template strand would be (3\' ATT 5\'), so the mRNA would be AUU. But AUU is a codon for isoleucine, nope. Wait, hold on.\n\nIf the core DNA sequence in the coding strand (5\' to 3\') for the mutated triplet is TAA, then during transcription, the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand, which would be ATT (since the coding strand is TAA). As MrNa matches coding strand substituting T for U. Thus, mRNA is UAA (not AUU). Oh! Because like DNA coding strand (sense) is TAA in mutant2. The mRNA is transcribed from the DNA\'s antiparallel complementary (template) strand. So if coding DNA is 5\' TAA 3\', then the mRNA would be... the template DNA is 3\' ATT 5\', so the mRNA would be 5\' AUU 3\'. But codons are read in the 5\'→3\' direction. So mRNA would be AUU (Isoleucine) unless the TAA is in the non-transcribed strand. Wait, now I\'m confused.\n\nWait, let me get this straight. The gene\'s coding strand (the sense strand) is the one given in the problem (5’-ATG...3’). The mRNA will be transcribed as complementary to the template strand; meaning if the coding ssDNA is ATG..., the template strand is complementary, TAC.... So mRNA is a copy of coding, but with T→U.\n\nWait correction: there are two DNA strands. The sense (coding) strand is same as mRNA (T→U), and the antisense (template) is complementary. So during transcription, the RNA pol reads the template (antisense) strand and creates mRNA matching the coding strand. So, in the same 5\' to 3\' direction.\n\nThus, if the coding strand of DNA (as given) has codons 5\'-XXX-XXX- in DNA, the mRNA will be 5\'-(XXX→ as U\'s)-\n\nIf\'s that the case, then in the wild type, position 7-9 of the coding DNA is CTC, mRNA is CUC (Leu).\n\nIn Mutant2, the coding DNA strands at positions 7-9 are TAA. Therefore, mRNA here would be UAA, which is a stop codon. Exactly. Therefore, this instance would cause a premature termination at codon2 (after the start). So after the start codon (AUG) and first Phe codon (UUU), the next codon on mRNA would be UAA (stop), hence translation would halt, resulting in a short peptide: Met-Phe-Stop. Therefore, this mutant cannot produce the enzyme needed for the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nTherefore, Mutant2 is the correct answer because it introduces a stop codon early in the gene, resulting in a truncated, nonfunctional protein.\n\nMutant1: missense and synonymous mutations, less impactful.\n\nMutant3: frameshift leading to possible truncated or altered protein, and if the frameshift causes later stop codons, the protein could be truncated, but depends where. Since on the first exon, ir\'d have to get a stop. But compared to Mutant2\'s early stop, that one is more assured to prevent the enzyme from being produced.\n\nMutant4: in-frame deletion of a codon (a glycine), leading to loss ofone amino acid. Possible amendant. But unless that glycine is crucial, gódemay still have partial function. So less likely.\n\nThus, the best answer is Mutant2.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743810142, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7484, prompt_tokens=1702, total_tokens=9186, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the gene sequences provided. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, ideally through a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) or a frameshift leading to a severely truncated protein. 

### Analysis of Mutants:
1. **Mutant 1**  
   - **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu) in exon 1 (synonymous) and GCT (Ala) → CGC (Arg) (missense).  
   - **Effect**: A missense mutation alters a single amino acid but does not guarantee loss of function. The synonymous mutation has no effect.  
   - **Conclusion**: Unlikely to eliminate the compound.

2. **Mutant 2**  
   - **Mutation**: CTC (Leu) → TAA in exon 1.  
   - **Effect**: TAA is a stop codon in mRNA (UAA). This introduces a premature termination after the second codon (Phe), truncating the protein early in translation.  
   - **Conclusion**: Likely results in a nonfunctional protein, eliminating the compound. **Best candidate**.

3. **Mutant 3**  
   - **Mutation**: Insertion of an extra T in the first exon, causing a frameshift.  
   - **Effect**: Alters the reading frame downstream, leading to a jumbled amino acid sequence. While frameshifts can cause truncation if a stop codon is encountered, the effect here is less predictable than a direct stop codon.  
   - **Conclusion**: Potentially disruptive but less definitive than Mutant 2.

4. **Mutant 4**  
   - **Mutation**: Deletion of the GGT (Gly) triplet in exon 1, resulting in an in-frame loss of one amino acid.  
   - **Effect**: Loss of a single residue may not fully inactivate the protein unless the deleted glycine is critical for function.  
   - **Conclusion**: Less likely to eliminate the compound compared to Mutant 2.

### Key Reasoning:
- **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) in the first exon, leading to a severely truncated protein (Met-Phe-Stop). This guarantees loss of function, preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.  
- Frameshifts (Mutant 3) and in-frame deletions (Mutant 4) are less definitive, while missense mutations (Mutant 1) are insufficient for complete inactivation.

**Answer**: Mutant 2

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

Na is:

5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T ... TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C ... TGA-3’

Hmm, comparing each position. Let's see:

Original positions from start codon (ATG is position 1-3). Then position 4: T, 5: T, 6: T, 7: C, 8: T, 9: C, 10: G, 11: C, 12: T, etc.

Mutant 1:

Position 4: T, 5: T, 6: T turns to... Wait, maybe they lost a T? Wait wait, the original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCT..., so the first few nucleotides after ATG are TTTCTCGCT...

Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCT... So after ATG, it's TTC TAC GCT...

Comparing:

Original: T T T C T C G C T...

Mutant 1: T T C T A C G C T...

Wait, here's the issue: In the original sequence, the nucleotides after ATG are TTT (positions 4-6) then CTC (positions 7-9). In mutant 1, they are TTC (positions 4-6: T, T, C) followed by TAC (positions 7-9: T, A, C). So, replacing TTT CTC with TTC TAC. That would mean Position 6 is changed from T to C (in TTC). Then position 7 is C to T (but wait, original had C at position 7, is that right?)

Wait, maybe the actual nucleotides need to be considered step by step.

Original (from 5' to 3' after ATG):

Positions: 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15...

Bases:      T T T C T C G C T G G T...

Mutant1 after ATG:

Positions 4-6: TTC (instead of TTT), then TAC (positions 7-9: T A C instead of CTC).

So, position 6: T→C (changing T to C). Positions 7-9: Original CTC becomes T A C. Wait, that is, position 7: C→T, position 8: T→A, position 9: C→C. Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Original sequence at positions 4-15:

ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T ACT...

So positions 4: T, 5: T, 6: T; positions 7: C, 8: T, 9: C; positions 10: G, 11: C, 12: T; 13: G, 14: G, 15: T.

In Mutant 1, after ATG: T T C T A C G C T G G T ACT...

So position 4: T, 5: T, 6: C (instead of T), positions 7: T, 8: A, 9: C (positions 7-9 are TAC instead of CTC). So here, there's a point mutation at position 6 (T→C), and a mutation at position 7 (C→T) and position 8 (T→A)? No, wait: To have TAC at positions 7-9, it would mean that the original CTC (positions 7-9) is changed to TAC. Let's break it down:

Original triplet CTC (positions 7-9): C (7), T (8), C (9)

Mutant1 triplet TAC: T (7), A (8), C (9)

So position 7: C → T (transversion?), position 8: T→ A.

This would be two point mutations in adjacent nucleotides, turning CTC to TAC. That's possible? Alternatively, perhaps there's a deletion or insertion? But looking at the overall sequence lengths... Let's check the lengths of all mutants. The answer options have varying sequences. But the question says that in mutant 4, there's a shorter sequence: "ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’"—so here, perhaps the GGT is missing (the original had GCTGGTACT, whereas mutant4 has ACTTCT..., maybe a deletion of some bases. Hmm.)

Alternatively, maybe the alignment isn't exact when there's a deletion. But in Mutant1, if positions 6-9 have changed from TCTC to CTAC. Wait, no, the alignment is more precise as: Original first exon after ATG has:

Positions (after ATG, so starting at position 1 as the first T): 

1: T, 2: T, 3: T, 4: C, etc.

No, maybe not. Let's index each base after the ATG. Let's number the entire gene starting at 1.

Original gene sequences:

1-3: ATG

4: T, 5: T, 6: T

7: C, 8: T, 9: C

10: G, 11: C, 12: T

13: G, 14: G, 15: T, etc.

Mutant 1:

After ATG (positions1-3: ATG), then:

4: T, 5: T, 6: C

7: T, 8: A, 9: C

10: G, 11: C, 12: T

position13 onwards same as in original. So mutations at positions6 (T→C), 7 (C→T), 8 (T→A). Wait, but that's three consecutive changes? That seems more like a possible deletion or maybe a SNP in three consecutive bases. But EMS typically causes point mutations. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe this is a frameshift or a small deletion. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the sequence as presented in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant1 is only one base change. Wait, looking again:

Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant1: ...TTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Original in this region: T T T C T C G C T G G T A...

Mutant1: T T T C T A C G C T G G T A...

Wait, hold on. Maybe the original is CT-CGC-TGG (using spaces for clarity), so the difference is in the third base of the CTx triplet. Let me line them up:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC...

Wait, maybe this is a rage. Let's code each triplet:

Original:
TTT (positions 4-6) → Phe (F)
CTC (7-9) → Leu (L)
GCT (10-12) → Ala (A)
GGT (13-15) → Gly (G)
ACT (16-18) → Thr (T)
... etc.

Mutant1:
TTT (same)
CTA (CT-A at positions7-9) → Leu (L; since CTA is also Leu)
CGC (10-12) → Arg (R)
...GGT becomes TGG? Wait, no, original was GCT (positions10-12: G C T) which becomes CGC (C G C) in mutant1? 

Wait in the original: positions10-12 are G C T → GCT (Ala)

In Mutant1: positions10-12 are C G C → CGC (Arg)

So, here after the first TTT, the original is CTC (Leu) followed by GCT (Ala), and in Mutant1, it's CTA (Leu) and CGC (Arg). So positions7-9: CTC → CTA (Leu to Leu; synonymous mutation) but positions10-12: GCT (Ala) → CGC (Arg). That would be a missense mutation.

So in mutant1, the amino acid changes from Leu-Ala to Leu-Arg. That's a non-synonymous mutation but not necessarily a frameshift or nonsense. If GCT (Ala) becomes CGC (Arg), it's a substitution. So this would just change an amino acid. Depending on where that is in the protein, it could affect function, but it's possible ESΜ could cause that. But would that eliminate the anti-nutritional compound? Possibly, but maybe not. The required mutation could be a nonsense mutation, which introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein, which may lose function. So if the protein is not made properly, perhaps the compound isn't synthesized.

Similarly, let's look at the other mutants.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT...

Mutant2 after ATG: TTC TAA GCT GGT...

Breaking into triplets:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT → Phe Leu Ala Gly

Mutant2: TTC TAA GCT GGT → Phe STOP ... if TAA is the triplet. TAA is a stop codon.

Because TAA is a stop codon in the standard genetic code. So if positions7-9 in mutant2 are TAA instead of CTC (from original), that inserts a premature stop codon. Original was CTC (position7-9) in the middle of exon 1. If it becomes TAA, then the mRNA would be TAA, which is a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. So that would likely result in a non-functional protein. Hence, this mutation (Mutant2) would lead to a premature termination, thus preventing the production of the anti-nutritional compound. So this is a possible candidate.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGA...

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGA...

Breaking down. After ATG:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA CTT CTG TGG ...

Wait, perhaps here there's an insertion?

Original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT -> so the next after GGT is ACT TCT... etc.

Mutant3 is TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA CTT CTG TGG... So the fourth base after ATG is an extra T? So in position4, there's T added? So from original T T T C T C G C T... Is it inserting a T? Or alternatively, in mutant3, the sequence starts as ATG T T T T A C G C..., so on position4, there's an extra T.

But let me align them more carefully. The original:

After ATG: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant3: T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T...

So inserting an extra T (or inserting an extra T at position 4) causes a frameshift. Let's see: After the original triplet TTT (positions4-6), comes CTC (positions7-9). In mutant3, after inserting a T, you'd get positions4-6 as T T T, but then the next base is T again. So inserting a T at position4 would shift everything after, leading to a different reading frame. Frameshift mutations typically lead to a completely altered amino acid sequence downstream and often result in premature stop codons. So if mutant3 has an insertion of a T, that would cause a frameshift and possible truncation. But examining the sequence given:

Original: comparing to mutant3:
Original sequence after ATG: starts TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant3: starts TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA...

Wait, original after ATG: positions4-15:

4-6: TTT,

7-9: CTC,

10-12: GCT,

13-15: GGT,

16-18: ACT,

19-21: TCT,

...

Mutant3:

ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A...

Wait position4-7: TTTT AC...

Thus, original positions4-6: TTT; Mutant3 adds another T, making TTTT (positions4-7: TTTT), but this is viewed as triplet: TTT TAC...? So, the first four nucleotides after ATG are TTTT A..., meaning triplet T T T (positions4-6, same as before), but then an extra T at position7. But actually, the way it's written in the problem, mutant3 is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ compared to the original 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, in the original, after the initial TTT, next is C T C G...

In mutant3, after TTT is T A C G...

Wait, it's inserting a T? Let's count:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T...

Mutant3: ATG T T T T A C G C T...

So inserting a T after the third T (position6?), making TTTT A... So triplet becomes TTT (positions4-6), TTA (positions7-9). Compare to original's TTT (positions4-6) and CTC (positions7-9). So insertion of a T between position6 and7 (original position6 was T, but after that, a T is inserted, making TTTT). This causes a frameshift mutation. Because inserting one nucleotide shifts the reading frame. So triplet positions7-9 become TTA (Leucine) instead of CTC (Leucine), but from that point onward, the entire reading frame is altered. This would change all subsequent codons, and the protein could be truncated if a premature stop codon is encountered. However, a frameshift mutation could lead to a non-functional protein, which might be what we want. But sometimes, the protein could be longer if the stop codon is later, but the sequence would be jumbled. Possibly, this may disrupt the gene product. But frameshifts can have various effects. However, depending on where the frameshift occurs, this might not introduce a stop codon immediately but just a different amino acid sequence. So the effect depends on the exact location. Nonetheless, it's a possibility.

Mutant4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...
Mutant4:
ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG ...

So comparing:

Original after ATG:

TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4 after ATG:

TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, they have deleted some nucleotides here. Let's check. In the original, positions 7-15: CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant4 skips GGT: sequences at mutant4 are TAC GCT ACT. Missing the GGT which was in the original. Let me line up:

Original exon1 part:

...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4:

...TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, in Original, after TTT (positions4-6) comes CTC GCT GGT ACT...

In Mutant4, TTT is followed by TAC GCT ACT... So comparing:

Original:

Positions7-9: CTC,

10-12: GCT,

13-15: GGT,

16-18: ACT...

Mutant4 positions7-9: TAC,

10-12: GCT,

13-15: ACT...

So Original segment CTC GCT GGT ACT is replaced with TAC GCT ACT. So the GGT triplet (positions13-15) is missing. There's a deletion of three nucleotides (GGT), perhaps. Alternatively, cell签证ed for DNA:

From the DNA sequences, original: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT... which would be CT DNA strand part. Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT... Hence, there's a possible deletion of the GGT triplet. If exactly three nucleotides are deleted, it's an in-frame deletion, leading to loss of one amino acid (Glycine, given GGT is Gly). If that's the case, in the mutant, the protein would be missing one amino acid. This could affect protein function, but some in-frame deletions allow the protein to be made but alter its function, depending on where the deletion occurs. However, if the gene's activity requires that region, then this might reduce or eliminate the production of the compound. But compared to a premature stop codon causing truncation, an in-frame deletion might not be as effective. However, depending on what part of the protein is deleted, it could be critical.

Now, to answer the question: we need to pick which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The gene's product is synthesizing the compound; if the gene is knocked out (nonfunctional), the compound shouldn't be made. The optimal mutation would be one that leads to a nonfunctional protein, such as a premature stop codon (a nonsense mutation) or a frameshift leading to a truncated protein. Synonymous mutations (silent) won't affect. Missense might reduce function, but depends.

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant1: Positions7-9 CTC→CTA (which is still leucine, synonymous), and then GCT→CGC (Ala→Arg) (missense). So two point mutations. But why are there two mutations close by? Since EMS generally causes point mutations, not double mutations, but I guess possible.

Mutant2 has CTC→TAA, which introduces a stop codon. That would result in truncation early in the protein. If the stop codon occurs in the first exon, the protein is very short. Assuming the original gene starts with ATG followed by coding exons. The TAA at positions7-9 (of mRNA) would mean the protein is only a few amino acids in length. This almost certainly inactivates the enzyme, as it's cut short early on.

Mutant3 has an insertion of a nucleotide, causing a frameshift. As a result, the reading frame shifts after the insertion, leading to a different amino acid sequence and potentially a premature stop codon. However, in the case of Mutant3, the mutation occurs after inserting a T, let's confirm:

Original sequence: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant3 sequence: ATG TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA... So inserting a T after the first three Ts. So the first three codons are ATG TTT TAC... wait that doesn't fit. Breaking it into triplets:

Original alignment after frameshift: 

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GT C T G TGG...

Wait, actually with the inserted T (making four Ts), so after the start codon, we have TTTT, so the first codon is ATG (start), next is TTT (same as original), then TAC (insertion causes the fourth T to pair with the next two bases? Let's see:

Original after ATG:

TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3 after ATG:

TTTT ACG CTG GTG TCA CTT...

Breaking into triplets starts from the first T:

Mutant3:
Positions4-6: TTT
Position7-9: TAC (T, additional T inserted? Wait, the insertion might be of a nucleotide, making the sequence one longer, thus the frame shifts by one. For example, original sequence is:

ATG T1 T2 T3 C4 T5 C6 G7 C8 T9 G10 G11 T12 etc.

Mutant3 inserts an extra T after T3, making:

ATG T1 T2 T3 T4 A5 C6 G7 C8 T9 G10 etc.

Thus, s pairwise:

Original frame after ATG:

TTT (codon1: Phe), CTC (codon2: Leu), GCT (codon3: Ala), GGT (codon4: Gly), etc.

Mutant3:

TTT (codon1: Phe), TAC (codon2: Tyr), GCT (codon3: Ala), GGT (codon4: Gly?), no wait, depends on the actual insertion. Since the inserted T shifts the frame, the second codon is T T T (no—it's shifted by one). If inserting an extra T at position4 (after T3), the sequence becomes T T T T A C G C T... Then the triplet align becomes:

Codon1: T T T (Phe)

Codon2: T T A (Leu)

Codon3: C G C (Arg)

Codon4: T G G (Trp?)

Wait, no, in DNA sequence direction is such that after ATG the sequence is forward. Wait, maybe using frame shifts would be difficult here. Let'try this step by step:

Original after ATG:
... T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...
Indices:4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18...

With the three Ts (positions4-6: TTT).

Mutant3 has an extra T inserted at position7. So now after the three Ts (positions4-6), there's an extra T at position7, making:

... T T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T ...

Wait no, no—Mutant3 sequence is written as "5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’".

So after ATG TTTT ACGCT etc. So:

ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A ...

Thus, the codons would be:

ATG (start) then:

First codon after ATG: TTT (positions4-6: unchanged)

Second codon: (positions7-9) TAC (inserted T at position7 makes this TAC)

Third codon: (positions10-12: GCT same as original but shifted due to insertion

Wait perhaps not. Let's consider:

After ATG, the original was:

positions4-6: T T T (codon1: TTT, Phe)

 positions7-9: C T C (codon2: CTC, Leu)

 positions10-12: G C T (codon3: GCT, Ala)

 positions13-15: G G T (codon4: GGT, Gly)

In mutant3, inserting an extra T between positions6 and7 (after the three Ts) leads to:

positions4-6: T T T (codon1: Phe)

positions7-9: T A C (codon2: TAC, Thr)

Wait, no. DNA is read in triplets. So after inserting a T, everything shifts. Original positions after3 Ts are CTC GCT GGT...

After inserting a T (after position6), the sequence would become T T T T C T C G C T, etc. So:

 positions4-6: T T T → same.

 positions7-9: T C T → TCT, Ser.

 position10-12: C G C → CGC, Arg

etc. Wait, no: Actually, inserting a T between positions6 and7:

DNA sequence becomes (with inserted T as position7a):

 positions:

4: T, 5:T,6:T,7a:T (inserted), 7:C,8:T,9:C,10:G, etc.

So the triplet after T T T becomes T (inserted), C, T (codon becomes T C T -> TCT, Ser), then next triplet is C G C (CGC, Arg), etc. The rest shifts.

So the result is that after the Phe (TTT), the next codon is Ser (TCT), replacing the original Leu (CTC). Then the next is Arg (CGC instead of Ala GCT). This seems like a frameshift alters reading frame starting at codon2. But despite this, the length of the codons remains the same (except for the shifted frame). Depending on where a STOP codon is encountered, there might be an early truncation, but I can't tell immediately without knowing whether the shifted frame contains a stop codon soon. Regardless, frameshifts often lead to nonfunctional proteins. This mutation may truncate the protein, which would help.

Mutant4: has a deletion of a triplet (likely), causing loss of Gly (GGT). So if three nucleotides are deleted (GGT), it's an in-frame mutation. The protein will be missing one amino acid (Gly). Depending on where that glycine is in the protein structure (e.g., if it's in a critical active site or structural position), this could inactivate the enzyme. However, single amino acid deletions can be less disruptive than truncations. Though for example, deleting a residue in an essential part could be dysfunctional.

Looking back at the options, which mutant is most likely to eliminate the compound. If the gene product is an enzyme, nonsense mutations (like Mutant2 introducing a premature stop) would terminate translation early. That is a classic loss-of-function mutation, resulting in a nonfunctional enzyme. Thus,Truncated enzyme cannot catalyze the biosynthesis of the compound. This would eliminate the antinutritional compound.

Mutant2: the mutation is in the first exon, early on, producing a premature stop codon. Thus, this is the most likely candidate. The TAA is a stop codon. In the DNA sequence, the original (positions7-9) sequence is CTC (coding strand), so in mRNA it would be GAG. In Mutant2, the coding DNA sequence is TAA, mRNA would be AUА (I think there may be confusion here DNA to mRNA). Wait: Let's think again. DNA is double-stranded. Since the DNA is given as 5'-ATG...3', then the coding strand is this sequence (as mRNA is complementary to the DNA template strand and same as the coding strand). Therefore, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA sequence (but with U replacing T). Wait no: DNA to mRNA: the mRNA is synthesized using the DNA template strand (antisense), so the mRNA sequence is complementary to the template and same as the coding strand (if the coding strand is the sense strand).

Given that the original DNA is written as 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’, presumably this is the coding (sense) strand, so mRNA would be complementary: starting with ATG->AUG, TTT-> AAA, CTC→GAG...

But in Mutant2, the codon at positions7-9, originally CTC, DNA is TAA in mutant2. So the coding DNA is a?Ligner's:

Mutant2:

After ATG, (DNA: T T C T A A...). 

Coding DNA for Mutant2 in position7 throuh9: TAA.

So the mRNA would be complementary, so the mRNA at these positions would be AUU?, but no. Wait, DNA sequence is given as 5'-ATG TTC TAA GCT... (in the first part). So the coding sequence for positions7-9 is TAA. The mRNA would be complementary to the template strand, so template DNA strand would have ATT here (since coding DNA has TAA (5' T A A 3')) then template strand would be (3' ATT 5'), so the mRNA would be AUU. But AUU is a codon for isoleucine, nope. Wait, hold on.

If the core DNA sequence in the coding strand (5' to 3') for the mutated triplet is TAA, then during transcription, the mRNA would be complementary to the template strand, which would be ATT (since the coding strand is TAA). As MrNa matches coding strand substituting T for U. Thus, mRNA is UAA (not AUU). Oh! Because like DNA coding strand (sense) is TAA in mutant2. The mRNA is transcribed from the DNA's antiparallel complementary (template) strand. So if coding DNA is 5' TAA 3', then the mRNA would be... the template DNA is 3' ATT 5', so the mRNA would be 5' AUU 3'. But codons are read in the 5'→3' direction. So mRNA would be AUU (Isoleucine) unless the TAA is in the non-transcribed strand. Wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, let me get this straight. The gene's coding strand (the sense strand) is the one given in the problem (5’-ATG...3’). The mRNA will be transcribed as complementary to the template strand; meaning if the coding ssDNA is ATG..., the template strand is complementary, TAC.... So mRNA is a copy of coding, but with T→U.

Wait correction: there are two DNA strands. The sense (coding) strand is same as mRNA (T→U), and the antisense (template) is complementary. So during transcription, the RNA pol reads the template (antisense) strand and creates mRNA matching the coding strand. So, in the same 5' to 3' direction.

Thus, if the coding strand of DNA (as given) has codons 5'-XXX-XXX- in DNA, the mRNA will be 5'-(XXX→ as U's)-

If's that the case, then in the wild type, position 7-9 of the coding DNA is CTC, mRNA is CUC (Leu).

In Mutant2, the coding DNA strands at positions 7-9 are TAA. Therefore, mRNA here would be UAA, which is a stop codon. Exactly. Therefore, this instance would cause a premature termination at codon2 (after the start). So after the start codon (AUG) and first Phe codon (UUU), the next codon on mRNA would be UAA (stop), hence translation would halt, resulting in a short peptide: Met-Phe-Stop. Therefore, this mutant cannot produce the enzyme needed for the anti-nutritional compound.

Therefore, Mutant2 is the correct answer because it introduces a stop codon early in the gene, resulting in a truncated, nonfunctional protein.

Mutant1: missense and synonymous mutations, less impactful.

Mutant3: frameshift leading to possible truncated or altered protein, and if the frameshift causes later stop codons, the protein could be truncated, but depends where. Since on the first exon, ir'd have to get a stop. But compared to Mutant2's early stop, that one is more assured to prevent the enzyme from being produced.

Mutant4: in-frame deletion of a codon (a glycine), leading to loss ofone amino acid. Possible amendant. But unless that glycine is crucial, gódemay still have partial function. So less likely.

Thus, the best answer is Mutant2.

Let\'s try that.\n\nThe original from the start:\n\n1  2  3  4  5  6  7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14...\nA  T  G  T  T  T  C T C G C T G G T... and so on.\n\nWait, hold on: As DNA is a double-stranded molecule, the coding strand is typically written 5\' to 3\' but for mRNA, the transcription is 5\' to 3\' of RNA, so the coding strand (non-template) is same as RNA, while the template strand is complementary.\n\nBut perhaps the right way is to compare the DNA sequences of the mutants vs the original, and then see what changes occur in the coding sequence, and translate them into amino acids.\n\nOriginal DNA sequence starting from the ATG (start codon):\n\nPositions (nucleotide number, including start):\n\n1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21...\nA  T  G  T  T  T  C  T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A... and so on.\n\nBut maybe the problem arises with missense versus nonsense mutations. A nonsense mutation would lead to a premature stop codon, which would truncate the protein and possibly eliminate its function. Alternatively, a frameshift mutation (if there\'s an insertion or deletion) would also disrupt the reading frame, leading to a potentially nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, a missense mutation in a critical residue, like the active site, could impair function.\n\nThe question is which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound. The gene\'s function is likely entirely knocked out; thus, a frameshift or nonsense mutation may be preferable to a missense. However, EMS typically causes point mutations (substitutions) rather than insertions or deletions. Looking at the mutants provided, it seems they are all point mutations except for Mutant 3 and Mutant 4. Let\'s check:\n\nOriginal:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\n\nMutant 1:\n\nATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA\n\nComparing the original to mutant 1:\n\nLooking at each nucleotide:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nBut perhaps let\'s look for the exact changes. From 5\' to 3\':\n\nOriginal:\n\nPosition 1-3: ATG (start)\n\nPositions 4-6: TTT\n\nPositions 7-9: C T C (so CTC on the coding strand. mRNA would be CUG, which is Leu.)\n\nWait, no: Wait, DNA strand is this sequence. mRNA is complementary to the template DNA strand.\n\nThe DNA is 5\' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... 3\', which is coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be 5\' AUG UUU CUG CGA ... etc. Wait, actually, when DNA is written as 5\' to 3\', the mRNA is complementary to the template strand, so it should be similar to coding strand except T\'s are U\'s.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me take each mutant and compare the DNA sequence to the original, and note down any nucleotide changes, find out if those changes cause any amino acid substitution, or a stop codon, or frameshift.\n\nOriginal DNA sequence from 5\' to 3\':\n\n1 ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T… TGA.\n\nBreaking that into codons (RNA would be AUG UUU CU G__ ...). Wait, starting at ATG (A is 5\'), so next is TTT (third triplet). Wait, the DNA is coding strand, so:\n\nmRNA is A U G U U U C U C G C U G G U A C U U C U G U G G A U G A A ... and so on.\n\nAh, perhaps breaking it into the mRNA:\n\nATG (start) corresponds to AUG, then next codons would be formed from the DNA sequence: TTT (DNA\'s coding strand) → mRNA UUU (Phe), then CTC → CUC (Leu), GCT → GCU (Ala), GGT → GGU (Gly), ACT → ACU (Thr), TCT → UCU (Ser), GTG → GUG (Val), GAT → GAU (Asp), GAA → GAA (Glu), CAT → CAU (His), etc.\n\nSo, the original protein sequence starts as:\n\nAUG (Met) - UUU (Phe) - CUC (Leu) - GCU (Ala) - GGU (Gly) - ACU (Thr) - UCU (Ser) - GUG (Val) - GAU (Asp) - GAA (Glu) - CAU (His) - etc.\n\nNow, let\'s look at each mutant:\n\n**Mutant 1**: 5’-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal part: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGA...\nMutant1:      ...TTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGA...\n\nLooking at DNA sequences:\n\nOriginal: ...C T C G C T... (positions after TTT)\nMutant1:      T A C G C T...\n\nWait, in the original sequence, CT-C-GC-T, so for positions corresponding to the fourth codon (third codon is TTT (positions1-3: ATG, positions4-6 TTT)) then positions7-9: in original, C T C (third codon: the third codon starts at position 4. Wait, perhaps I should number differently.\n\nWait, the initial DNA is:\n\nStart ATG (positions 1-3)\n\nPosition 4: T, position5:T, position6:T\n\nPositions7:C, 8:T,9:C\n\n10:G,11:C,12:T\n\n13:G,14:G,15:T\n\n16:A,17:C,18:T\n\netcz\n\nLooking at Mutant1:\n\nATG T T T C T A C G C T G G T...\n\nSo, the original here at positions7 (C),8 (T),9 (C) -> Mutant1 has positions7 (C?), wait: wait the original is CT-C-... Wait, hold on:\n\nOriginal DNA sequence (parent gene):\n\nFrom the beginning:\n\n5\' ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA 3\'\n\nLet\'s parse from start codon:\n\n1-3: ATG (start)\n\n4-6: T T T (TTT, so Phe in mRNA)\n\n7-9: C T C → in mRNA: CUC (Leu)\n\n10-12: G C T → mRNA GCU (Ala)\n\n13-15: G G T→ GGU (Gly)\n\n16-18: A C T → ACU (Thr)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nMutant1 has:\n\nATG T T T C T A C G C T G G T ...\n\nWait, between positions 7-12 in the original: C T C G C T\n\nIn Mutant1: At positions after initial TTT (positions4-6: T T T), positions7-9 are C T A (sequence at positions7-9), then positions10-12 are C G C.\n\nWait, no. Wait, original:\n\nAfter TTT (positions4-6):\n\npos7:C,pos8:T,pos9:C\n\npos10:G, pos11:C, pos12:T\n\nThen pos13:G...\n\nIn Mutant1:\n\nAfter TTT (pos4-6), the sequence is C T A (at pos7-9?), so position7:C, pos8:T, pos9:A?\n\nOriginal CT C G C T (pos7 is C, pos8 T, pos9 C; then pos10 G, pos11 C, pos12 T.)\n\nMutant1 is... Let me check the mutation.\n\nOriginal sequence given for Mutant1: (Mutant1\'s first part is ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...)\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nStarting from ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC ... So comparing to the original:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC...\n\nSo in terms of mutations, this would mean that at position where the original had CTC (positions 4-6: TTT; then original positions7-9 are CTC), in Mutant1 it\'s CTA.\n\nSo the change here is at position third nucleotide of the second codon (if starting after ATG). Alternatively, original Codon2: TTT (Phe in mRNA), Codon3: CTC (Leu in DNA is CT C in the DNA coding strand which becomes CUC in mRNA, encoding Leu).\n\nIn Mutant1, the codon3 of the DNA becomes CTA. So the third codon becomes CTA, which in mRNA (CUA), which still codes for Leu. Since Leu has several codons (CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG, etc.), this mutation is a synonymous mutation (i.e., same amino acid). So the older leucine codon (CUC) becomes CUA (Leu). So no change in the amino acid. Therefore this is a silent mutation, unlikely to affect the protein.\n\nBut then also at position 10-12 in DNA: original GCT (which for mRNA is GCU, encoding Ala) becomes CGC (DNA) → mRNA is CGC, which encodes Arg. Wait, a point mutation here.\n\nSo if the 4th codon (originally GCT → Ala) in DNA becomes CGC (Arg in mRNA is CGC), which encoding Arg. Thus, this is a missense mutation: Ala → Arg. Whether this affects the protein function depends on the position. A missense might reduce activity, but maybe not eliminate it. But since it\'s a single amino acid change, unless it\'s in a critical area, perhaps not leading to complete loss of function.\n\nFurthermore, the later part of the mutant sequence shows ...TGTCGC... compared to original ...TGTCGT..., which is the last part near the end. Let\'s check:\n\nOriginal DNA after ... CATATTTATTGTCGT ... TGTCGT would be DNA\'s ends of the gene?\n\nIn mutant1, towards the end: TGTCGC. The last codon before TGA (stop) here is GTC in DNA → GTC in mRNA would be GUC, which codes for Val. But in mutant1, the change is from T to C in the DNA. What\'s the position?\n\nOriginal: T G T C G T … TGA. Let\'s say this is a triplet ending in T, G, and so on. Wait, the last part is TGTCGT, which corresponds to codons TGT (Cys) and CGT (Arg in DNA → mRNA CGU, which codes Arg). In Mutant1, TGT becomes TGC (TGT C in DNA = TGC, so mRNA TGC codes for Cys), and CGT becomes CGC (same, another Arg codon). These changes would not alter the amino acids (Cysteine and Arginine have multiple codons), so silent mutations. Wait, TGT in DNA is complementary to ACA in the template strand, but mRNA would be UGU (Cys). If it changes to TGC (DNA), the mRNA would be UGC (still Cys). Similarly, CGT (DNA) is Arg (mRNA CGU). If changed to CGC (DNA) → mRNA CGG (if CGC?), Wait, DNA\'s CGC would code for mRNA\'s CGC, which is also Arg. Wait, pause.\n\nSo actually, if original was CGT, then mRNA is CGU, which is Arg. In mutant1, it\'s CGC (DNA), mRNA CGC → also Arg. So this is a synonymous mutation. Therefore, the only coding change in Mutant1 is codon4 going from Ala to Arg. That might affect the protein, but perhaps not eliminate it.\n\n**Mutant2:** 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal sequence around here: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...\n\nMutant2 starts with ATGTTCTAA...\n\nWait, comparing Original: TTTCTCGCT...\n\nMutant2: TTCTAAGCT... So the original positions4-12: TTTCTCGCTGGTA...\n\nMutant2\'s sequence: TTCTAAGCTGGTA...\n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps there\'s a deletion or insertion? Let\'s check closely:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...\n\nBut looking at the exact DNA sequence as given:\n\nOriginal:\n\nATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...\n\nMutant2:\n\nATG T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T...\n\nWait, but it\'s written as ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...\n\nSo, inserting possibly a T?\n\nWait, let me count letters properly.\n\nOriginal starts as:\n\nA T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...\n\nWhich would be:\n\nPositions:\n\n1: A, 2: T, 3: G,\n\n4: T, 5: T, 6: T,\n\n7: C,8: T,9: C,\n\n10: G,11: C,12: T,\n\n13: G,14: G,15: T,\n\n16: A,17: C,18: T...\n\nMutant 2:\n\nA T G T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T...\n\nWait, perhaps there\'s a deletion of a T at position 6 (original has T at 6, mutant has C at position 5, T at 6? Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a deletion of a T and substitution. Let\'s index:\n\nOriginal:\n\nIndex 4: T, 5: T, 6:T; 7:C, 8:T,9:C, 10:G,11:C,12:T...\n\nMutant2 starts with ATG, then the next nucleotides are T T C T A A G C T...\n\nSo after ATG (positions 1-3), maybe pos4 is T, pos5 is T, pos6 is C (instead of T), then pos7: T, pos8: A, pos9: A, etc., until pos12.\n\nThus:\n\nOriginal triplet at 4-6: TTT (Phe, codon2).\n\nBut in Mutant2, that would be TTC at 4-6 (so Phe still; TTC in DNA → TTC mRNA is also coding Phe). Then position7-9: TAA (DNA) → mRNA UAA (which is a stop codon).\n\nAh, that would be a nonsense mutation here, causing premature termination. So original codon at positions7-9 (CTC) in DNA leads to CUC (Leu) in mRNA. Mutant2 here has TAA → mRNA UAA (stop). Therefore, the protein would be truncated at codon3 (after the initial Met-Phe), leading to a much shorter protein, presumably nonfunctional.\n\nThat sounds like a strong candidate, as a stop codon early in the gene would prevent the anti-nutritional compound from being synthesized. Thus, Mutant2 introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation).\n\n**Mutant3:** 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3\'\n\nOriginal sequence starting after ATG:\nTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA…\nMutant3: TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGA...\n\nLooking for changes:\n\nOriginal: after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...\n\nMutant3: TTTTACGCTGGTGTCAC...\n\nFirst, the original sequence has after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant3 has after ATG: TTT T ACG CTG GTG TCA...\n\nThe "TTT" gets extended? Wait, perhaps there\'s an insertion or duplication. Let\'s look nucleotide by nucleotide:\n\nOriginal: positions4-...\n\n4:T,5:T,6:T,\n\n7:C,8:T,9:C,\n\n10:G,11:C,12:T,\n\n13:G,14:G,15:T,\n\n16:A,17:C,18:T...\n\nMutant3:\n\n4:T,5:T,6:T,\n\n7:T,8:A,9:C,\n\n10:G,11:C,12:T,\n\n13:G,14:G,15:T,\n\nThen G T C A C T...\n\nOriginal at positions13-15: GGT,\n\nIn mutant3, after position15 (T), how is the sequence?\n\nWait this is getting a bit confusing. Mutant3 as written: "...ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…"\n\nBreakdown:\n\nAfter ATG: T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T...\n\nOriginal had:\n\nAfter ATG: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...\n\nComparing:\n\nIn the area where original has at positions 7-9: C T C, Mutant3 has at that same position T A C.\n\nThus, in the DNA, the original nucleotides at 7, 8,9: C T C → in Mutant3: T A C.\n\nThis results in a change in the codon. Let\'s consider codons here.\n\nOriginal Codon3 (after Met): TTT (ATG TTT) is position4-6. Then positions7-9: CTC (DNA) → mRNA: CUC (Leu). In Mutant3, positions7-9: TAC (DNA) → mRNA UAC (Tyr). This is a missense mutation (Leu to Tyr).\n\nBut then also, in Mutant3:\n\nAfter codon4 (original GCT (Ala)), mutant3 shows GCT GGTGTCACT...\n\nOriginal codon5 would be GGT → Gly, while in mutant3, the sequence from position 10-12 is GCT, which is again you need to check.\n\nWait, but in Mutant3 as presented, I noticed there\'s a part that may be mismatched. Let me directly compare the given mutant sequence.\n\nOriginalGene: first part (from start):\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nMutant3:\n\nATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nComparing, so after ATG, the first three nucleotides (positions 4-6) in original are TTT (which is codon2, Phe). Then, positions7-9 in original are CTC → Codon3, Leu (CUC). In mutant3, positions7-9 are TAC (codon3) → mRNA UAC, Tyr. So that\'s one missense mutation here (Leu to Tyr).\n\nFurthermore, comparing codon4: original GCT (Ala) remains the same in mutant3 (GCT). Then, the next codon, original GGT (Gly, positions13-15) in original has triplets ... GGT ACT ... ; in mutant3, after GCT there is GGT GTC ACT...\n\nOriginal codon5 (GGT - Gly), then codon6 (ACT - Thr)\n\nMutant3: Codon5: GGT (Gly); codon6: GTC (DNA) → mRNA GUC (Val); codon7: ACT → Thr.\n\nWait, so a shift here? The original codon6 is ACT (Thr), mutant6 is GTC (Val). Therefore:\n\nOriginal codon structure after position13:\n\n13 GGT (codon5, Gly)\n\n16 ACT (codon6, Thr)\n\n19 TCT (codon7, Ser)\n\nIn mutant3, after 10, perhaps 13 GGT, then next codon is GTG → GTG in DNA is GUG in mRNA (Val), then ACT. Wait, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, maybe Mutant3\'s sequence between the "GGT" and "ACT" has changed from original GGT ACT to GGT GTC ACT. So, between codon5 (GGT) and codon6 (ACT), GTC has been inserted? But if so, this would cause a frameshift if there’s an insertion. But looking at the provided sequences:\n\nMutant3: ...GGTGTCACT...\n\nOriginal: ...GGTACT...\n\nSo the original had, after GGT comes ACT (i.e., GGTACT becomes the sequence). Mutant3 has GGTGTCACT. So the original separated as GGT ACT. Mutant3 is GGT GTC ACT. Wait, but that interpretation would mean that in the original, positions 16-18 are ACT and positions19-21 are TCT. In mutant3, they insert a GTC between GGT and ACT. Wait, that would be a duplication of GTC. Alternatively, perhaps comparing DNA sequences precisely:\n\nOriginal from GGT ACT:\n\nPositions13-15: GGT (positions13=G,14=G,15=T)\n\nThen positions16-18: ACT (16=A,17=C,18=T)\n\nMutant3: After original positions13-15: GGT, then we have GTC (positions16-18: GTC), then act (positions19-21: ACT). So if the original sequence GGT  ACT (GGTA CT? How the letters are arranged.)\n\nWait, another approach. The mutant\'s sequence seems to add three nucleotides (GTC) between GGT and ACT. If that\'s the case, that\'s an insertion of three nucleotides (GGT GTC ACT instead of GGT ACT). Thus, inserting three nucleotides (GTC) would be an in-frame insertion, adding one amino acid (Val) after Gly. But this would not necessarily disrupt the reading frame, as the insertion is three nucleotides. Therefore, this would lead to the insertion of a Valine residue, but the rest of the sequence after would be in frame. However, if the protein tolerance varies, but unless critical regions are affected, this might not disable the protein completely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a different substitution here. Let me check the mutant3: original GGTACT becomes GGTGTCACT. So the original after GGT is ACT (positions16-18). Mutant3 substitutes the \'A\' of ACT (position16) with \'GTC\' to form GGTGTCACT, effectively changing the ACT to GTC, followed by ACT. Wait, perhaps this is an Insertion _and_ substitution, making it more complex.\n\nIf Mutant3 has inserted three extra nucleotides (GTC), causing an insertion of Val, and then ACT (Thr) as before. Alternatively, maybe at codon6 (original position16-18: ACT, Thr), it would now change to GTC (Val). That would be a missense mutation. However, overcomplicating—if indeed it\'s an insertion before ACT, the triplet insertion would not shift the frame. Hence, leading to one extra Val, but the rest of the sequence remains in reading frame. So the protein is longer by one amino acid here, but this might not significantly disrupt its function. \n\nSo Mutant3 has a Leu→Tyr substitution in codon3 and an insertion of Val in codon5, leading to Gly > Gly, followed by Val, then Thr. Hmm. But this might not be as detrimental as a premature stop codon.\n\n**Mutant4:** 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...\n\nMutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...\n\nComparing the two sequences:\n\nOriginal has after ATG: TTTCTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant4: TTTTAC GCT ACT TCT...\n\nWait, the original:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...\n\nMutant4:\n\nATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...\n\nSo here, after the first TTT (codon2, Phe), the Mutant4 has TAC (DNA) → mRNA UAC (Tyr) in codon3 instead of original CTC → Leu. Also, in codon4, original GCT (Ala) is present in Mutant4. Then, at codon5, original GGT (Gly) is replaced by ACT (Thr). That would be another amino acid substitution. But also, there seems to be missing some nucleotides.\n\nWait, the provided mutant4 sequence is:\n\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal:\n\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nSo, exact comparison between the two:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\n4 T,5 T,6 T\n\n7 C,8 T,9 C\n\n10 G,11 C,12 T\n\n13 G,14 G,15 T\n\n16 A,17 C,18 T …\n\nMutant4:\n\n4 T,5 T,6 T\n\n7 T,8 A,9 C\n\n10 G,11 C,12 T\n\n\n13 A,14 C,15 T\n\n16 T,17 C,18 T ...\n\nWait, from position13 onward:\n\nOriginal was 13 G,14 G,15 T (GGT - Gly)\n\nMutant4: 13 A,14 C,15 T (ACT). So here, in codon5 (originally GGT) there\'s ACT (Thr). This could be a substitution from Gly to Thr.\n\nBut let\'s look at the entire sequence:\n\nOriginal first split into triplets:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA\n\nMutant4 triplets after ATG:\n\nATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA …\n\nSo, codon3 in original (Leu/CUC) is now TAC/Tyr, and codon5 (Gly/GGT) becomes Thr/ACT. This is two missense mutations. The question is whether these significantly disrupt the protein. Two amino acid changes could cause partial loss of function, but again, unless those residues are critical, it\'s possible the protein retains some function.\n\nNow, evaluating which mutation eliminates the protein.\n\nMutant1: Silent mutation (Leu→Leu) and a missense (Ala→Arg) = perhaps reduces activity.\n\nMutant2: Changes codon3 (Leu) to a stop codon (UAA), leading to a truncated protein of two amino acids (Met-Phe), which probably is entirely nonfunctional.\n\nMutant3: Two substitutions (Leu→Tyr and Thr→Val; plus extra insertion which adds an amino acid) → significant changes but maybe not enough to eliminate activity.\n\nMutant4: Two substitutions (Leu→Tyr and Gly→Thr) → could reduce but not eliminate.\n\nTherefore, Mutant2 with the early termination codon is most likely to eliminate the protein product, hence stop the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. EMS often causes such nonsense mutations (when a TAA, TAG, or TGA codon appears due to point mutation). Therefore, Mutant2 likely introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional truncated protein.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743810443, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6790, prompt_tokens=1005, total_tokens=7795, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the impact of each mutation on the gene's protein product:

### **Mutant Analysis**  
1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - **Change**: Third codon (CTC → CTA in DNA; mRNA: CUC → CUA).  
   - **Effect**: Synonymous mutation (Leu → Leu). No amino acid change.  
   - Additionally, a missense mutation in codon4 (GCT → CGC in DNA; mRNA: GCU → CGC). This changes Ala → Arg.  
   - **Conclusion**: Unlikely to disrupt protein function significantly.  

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - **Change**: Third codon (CTC → TAA in DNA; mRNA: CUC → UAA).  
   - **Effect**: Nonsense mutation (Leu → STOP). Results in a truncated protein (Met-Phe-STOP).  
   - **Conclusion**: Premature termination likely abolishes the protein's function entirely, preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.  

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - **Change**: Codon3 (CTC → TAC in DNA; mRNA: CUC → UAC), changing Leu → Tyr.  
   - **Insertion**: Three nucleotides (GTC) inserted between codon5 and codon6, adding a Val residue.  
   - **Effect**: Missense and in-frame insertion. The protein retains its reading frame but has altered residues.  
   - **Conclusion**: Partial disruption possible, but full functionality might remain.  

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - **Changes**:  
     - Codon3 (CTC → TAC in DNA; mRNA: CUC → UAC; Leu → Tyr).  
     - Codon5 (GGT → ACT in DNA; mRNA: GGU → ACU; Gly → Thr).  
   - **Effect**: Two missense mutations.  
   - **Conclusion**: Likely reduces but does not eliminate protein function unless critical residues are altered.  

### **Key Insight**  
**Mutant 2** introduces a **premature stop codon** (UAA) early in the coding sequence. This truncates the protein after just two amino acids (Met-Phe), rendering it nonfunctional. EMS mutagenesis frequently causes such nonsense mutations via G/C → A/T transitions, making this the most plausible candidate for completely abolishing the anti-nutritional compound.  

**Answer:**  
**Mutant 2** will most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound via a premature stop codon, terminating translation early and preventing functional protein synthesis.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning



Wait, let's write this in the same way.

Original sequence after ATG (start):
Positions (relative to start codon, excluding the ATG):
Triplet 1: TTT (positions 1-3)
Triplet 2: CTC (positions 4-6)
Triplet 3: GCT (positions 7-9)
Triplet 4: GGT (positions 10-12)
And so on.

But looking at Mutant 1, compare:

Original Triplet 2: CTC (positions 4-6 in the original?)
Wait, maybe a better approach is to index each letter:

Original DNA sequence start after ATG:

ATG followed by T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T ... etc.

Wait, sometimes when we deal with DNA sequences, changes are easier to spot if we look nucleotide by nucleotide rather than codons. Let's try that.

The original from the start:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14...
A  T  G  T  T  T  C T C G C T G G T... and so on.

Wait, hold on: As DNA is a double-stranded molecule, the coding strand is typically written 5' to 3' but for mRNA, the transcription is 5' to 3' of RNA, so the coding strand (non-template) is same as RNA, while the template strand is complementary.

But perhaps the right way is to compare the DNA sequences of the mutants vs the original, and then see what changes occur in the coding sequence, and translate them into amino acids.

Original DNA sequence starting from the ATG (start codon):

Positions (nucleotide number, including start):

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21...
A  T  G  T  T  T  C  T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A... and so on.

But maybe the problem arises with missense versus nonsense mutations. A nonsense mutation would lead to a premature stop codon, which would truncate the protein and possibly eliminate its function. Alternatively, a frameshift mutation (if there's an insertion or deletion) would also disrupt the reading frame, leading to a potentially nonfunctional protein. Alternatively, a missense mutation in a critical residue, like the active site, could impair function.

The question is which mutation is most likely to eliminate the compound. The gene's function is likely entirely knocked out; thus, a frameshift or nonsense mutation may be preferable to a missense. However, EMS typically causes point mutations (substitutions) rather than insertions or deletions. Looking at the mutants provided, it seems they are all point mutations except for Mutant 3 and Mutant 4. Let's check:

Original:

ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1:

ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Comparing the original to mutant 1:

Looking at each nucleotide:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

But perhaps let's look for the exact changes. From 5' to 3':

Original:

Position 1-3: ATG (start)

Positions 4-6: TTT

Positions 7-9: C T C (so CTC on the coding strand. mRNA would be CUG, which is Leu.)

Wait, no: Wait, DNA strand is this sequence. mRNA is complementary to the template DNA strand.

The DNA is 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... 3', which is coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be 5' AUG UUU CUG CGA ... etc. Wait, actually, when DNA is written as 5' to 3', the mRNA is complementary to the template strand, so it should be similar to coding strand except T's are U's.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me take each mutant and compare the DNA sequence to the original, and note down any nucleotide changes, find out if those changes cause any amino acid substitution, or a stop codon, or frameshift.

Original DNA sequence from 5' to 3':

1 ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T… TGA.

Breaking that into codons (RNA would be AUG UUU CU G__ ...). Wait, starting at ATG (A is 5'), so next is TTT (third triplet). Wait, the DNA is coding strand, so:

mRNA is A U G U U U C U C G C U G G U A C U U C U G U G G A U G A A ... and so on.

Ah, perhaps breaking it into the mRNA:

ATG (start) corresponds to AUG, then next codons would be formed from the DNA sequence: TTT (DNA's coding strand) → mRNA UUU (Phe), then CTC → CUC (Leu), GCT → GCU (Ala), GGT → GGU (Gly), ACT → ACU (Thr), TCT → UCU (Ser), GTG → GUG (Val), GAT → GAU (Asp), GAA → GAA (Glu), CAT → CAU (His), etc.

So, the original protein sequence starts as:

AUG (Met) - UUU (Phe) - CUC (Leu) - GCU (Ala) - GGU (Gly) - ACU (Thr) - UCU (Ser) - GUG (Val) - GAU (Asp) - GAA (Glu) - CAU (His) - etc.

Now, let's look at each mutant:

**Mutant 1**: 5’-ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original part: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGA...
Mutant1:      ...TTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGA...

Looking at DNA sequences:

Original: ...C T C G C T... (positions after TTT)
Mutant1:      T A C G C T...

Wait, in the original sequence, CT-C-GC-T, so for positions corresponding to the fourth codon (third codon is TTT (positions1-3: ATG, positions4-6 TTT)) then positions7-9: in original, C T C (third codon: the third codon starts at position 4. Wait, perhaps I should number differently.

Wait, the initial DNA is:

Start ATG (positions 1-3)

Position 4: T, position5:T, position6:T

Positions7:C, 8:T,9:C

10:G,11:C,12:T

13:G,14:G,15:T

16:A,17:C,18:T

etcz

Looking at Mutant1:

ATG T T T C T A C G C T G G T...

So, the original here at positions7 (C),8 (T),9 (C) -> Mutant1 has positions7 (C?), wait: wait the original is CT-C-... Wait, hold on:

Original DNA sequence (parent gene):

From the beginning:

5' ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA 3'

Let's parse from start codon:

1-3: ATG (start)

4-6: T T T (TTT, so Phe in mRNA)

7-9: C T C → in mRNA: CUC (Leu)

10-12: G C T → mRNA GCU (Ala)

13-15: G G T→ GGU (Gly)

16-18: A C T → ACU (Thr)

And so on.

Mutant1 has:

ATG T T T C T A C G C T G G T ...

Wait, between positions 7-12 in the original: C T C G C T

In Mutant1: At positions after initial TTT (positions4-6: T T T), positions7-9 are C T A (sequence at positions7-9), then positions10-12 are C G C.

Wait, no. Wait, original:

After TTT (positions4-6):

pos7:C,pos8:T,pos9:C

pos10:G, pos11:C, pos12:T

Then pos13:G...

In Mutant1:

After TTT (pos4-6), the sequence is C T A (at pos7-9?), so position7:C, pos8:T, pos9:A?

Original CT C G C T (pos7 is C, pos8 T, pos9 C; then pos10 G, pos11 C, pos12 T.)

Mutant1 is... Let me check the mutation.

Original sequence given for Mutant1: (Mutant1's first part is ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...)

Breaking it down:

Starting from ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC ... So comparing to the original:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC...

So in terms of mutations, this would mean that at position where the original had CTC (positions 4-6: TTT; then original positions7-9 are CTC), in Mutant1 it's CTA.

So the change here is at position third nucleotide of the second codon (if starting after ATG). Alternatively, original Codon2: TTT (Phe in mRNA), Codon3: CTC (Leu in DNA is CT C in the DNA coding strand which becomes CUC in mRNA, encoding Leu).

In Mutant1, the codon3 of the DNA becomes CTA. So the third codon becomes CTA, which in mRNA (CUA), which still codes for Leu. Since Leu has several codons (CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG, etc.), this mutation is a synonymous mutation (i.e., same amino acid). So the older leucine codon (CUC) becomes CUA (Leu). So no change in the amino acid. Therefore this is a silent mutation, unlikely to affect the protein.

But then also at position 10-12 in DNA: original GCT (which for mRNA is GCU, encoding Ala) becomes CGC (DNA) → mRNA is CGC, which encodes Arg. Wait, a point mutation here.

So if the 4th codon (originally GCT → Ala) in DNA becomes CGC (Arg in mRNA is CGC), which encoding Arg. Thus, this is a missense mutation: Ala → Arg. Whether this affects the protein function depends on the position. A missense might reduce activity, but maybe not eliminate it. But since it's a single amino acid change, unless it's in a critical area, perhaps not leading to complete loss of function.

Furthermore, the later part of the mutant sequence shows ...TGTCGC... compared to original ...TGTCGT..., which is the last part near the end. Let's check:

Original DNA after ... CATATTTATTGTCGT ... TGTCGT would be DNA's ends of the gene?

In mutant1, towards the end: TGTCGC. The last codon before TGA (stop) here is GTC in DNA → GTC in mRNA would be GUC, which codes for Val. But in mutant1, the change is from T to C in the DNA. What's the position?

Original: T G T C G T … TGA. Let's say this is a triplet ending in T, G, and so on. Wait, the last part is TGTCGT, which corresponds to codons TGT (Cys) and CGT (Arg in DNA → mRNA CGU, which codes Arg). In Mutant1, TGT becomes TGC (TGT C in DNA = TGC, so mRNA TGC codes for Cys), and CGT becomes CGC (same, another Arg codon). These changes would not alter the amino acids (Cysteine and Arginine have multiple codons), so silent mutations. Wait, TGT in DNA is complementary to ACA in the template strand, but mRNA would be UGU (Cys). If it changes to TGC (DNA), the mRNA would be UGC (still Cys). Similarly, CGT (DNA) is Arg (mRNA CGU). If changed to CGC (DNA) → mRNA CGG (if CGC?), Wait, DNA's CGC would code for mRNA's CGC, which is also Arg. Wait, pause.

So actually, if original was CGT, then mRNA is CGU, which is Arg. In mutant1, it's CGC (DNA), mRNA CGC → also Arg. So this is a synonymous mutation. Therefore, the only coding change in Mutant1 is codon4 going from Ala to Arg. That might affect the protein, but perhaps not eliminate it.

**Mutant2:** 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original sequence around here: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant2 starts with ATGTTCTAA...

Wait, comparing Original: TTTCTCGCT...

Mutant2: TTCTAAGCT... So the original positions4-12: TTTCTCGCTGGTA...

Mutant2's sequence: TTCTAAGCTGGTA...

Hmm. Wait, perhaps there's a deletion or insertion? Let's check closely:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

But looking at the exact DNA sequence as given:

Original:

ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...

Mutant2:

ATG T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T...

Wait, but it's written as ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, inserting possibly a T?

Wait, let me count letters properly.

Original starts as:

A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T...

Which would be:

Positions:

1: A, 2: T, 3: G,

4: T, 5: T, 6: T,

7: C,8: T,9: C,

10: G,11: C,12: T,

13: G,14: G,15: T,

16: A,17: C,18: T...

Mutant 2:

A T G T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T...

Wait, perhaps there's a deletion of a T at position 6 (original has T at 6, mutant has C at position 5, T at 6? Not clear.

Alternatively, maybe there's a deletion of a T and substitution. Let's index:

Original:

Index 4: T, 5: T, 6:T; 7:C, 8:T,9:C, 10:G,11:C,12:T...

Mutant2 starts with ATG, then the next nucleotides are T T C T A A G C T...

So after ATG (positions 1-3), maybe pos4 is T, pos5 is T, pos6 is C (instead of T), then pos7: T, pos8: A, pos9: A, etc., until pos12.

Thus:

Original triplet at 4-6: TTT (Phe, codon2).

But in Mutant2, that would be TTC at 4-6 (so Phe still; TTC in DNA → TTC mRNA is also coding Phe). Then position7-9: TAA (DNA) → mRNA UAA (which is a stop codon).

Ah, that would be a nonsense mutation here, causing premature termination. So original codon at positions7-9 (CTC) in DNA leads to CUC (Leu) in mRNA. Mutant2 here has TAA → mRNA UAA (stop). Therefore, the protein would be truncated at codon3 (after the initial Met-Phe), leading to a much shorter protein, presumably nonfunctional.

That sounds like a strong candidate, as a stop codon early in the gene would prevent the anti-nutritional compound from being synthesized. Thus, Mutant2 introduces a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation).

**Mutant3:** 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'

Original sequence starting after ATG:
TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA…
Mutant3: TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGA...

Looking for changes:

Original: after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant3: TTTTACGCTGGTGTCAC...

First, the original sequence has after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant3 has after ATG: TTT T ACG CTG GTG TCA...

The "TTT" gets extended? Wait, perhaps there's an insertion or duplication. Let's look nucleotide by nucleotide:

Original: positions4-...

4:T,5:T,6:T,

7:C,8:T,9:C,

10:G,11:C,12:T,

13:G,14:G,15:T,

16:A,17:C,18:T...

Mutant3:

4:T,5:T,6:T,

7:T,8:A,9:C,

10:G,11:C,12:T,

13:G,14:G,15:T,

Then G T C A C T...

Original at positions13-15: GGT,

In mutant3, after position15 (T), how is the sequence?

Wait this is getting a bit confusing. Mutant3 as written: "...ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…"

Breakdown:

After ATG: T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Original had:

After ATG: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Comparing:

In the area where original has at positions 7-9: C T C, Mutant3 has at that same position T A C.

Thus, in the DNA, the original nucleotides at 7, 8,9: C T C → in Mutant3: T A C.

This results in a change in the codon. Let's consider codons here.

Original Codon3 (after Met): TTT (ATG TTT) is position4-6. Then positions7-9: CTC (DNA) → mRNA: CUC (Leu). In Mutant3, positions7-9: TAC (DNA) → mRNA UAC (Tyr). This is a missense mutation (Leu to Tyr).

But then also, in Mutant3:

After codon4 (original GCT (Ala)), mutant3 shows GCT GGTGTCACT...

Original codon5 would be GGT → Gly, while in mutant3, the sequence from position 10-12 is GCT, which is again you need to check.

Wait, but in Mutant3 as presented, I noticed there's a part that may be mismatched. Let me directly compare the given mutant sequence.

OriginalGene: first part (from start):

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Comparing, so after ATG, the first three nucleotides (positions 4-6) in original are TTT (which is codon2, Phe). Then, positions7-9 in original are CTC → Codon3, Leu (CUC). In mutant3, positions7-9 are TAC (codon3) → mRNA UAC, Tyr. So that's one missense mutation here (Leu to Tyr).

Furthermore, comparing codon4: original GCT (Ala) remains the same in mutant3 (GCT). Then, the next codon, original GGT (Gly, positions13-15) in original has triplets ... GGT ACT ... ; in mutant3, after GCT there is GGT GTC ACT...

Original codon5 (GGT - Gly), then codon6 (ACT - Thr)

Mutant3: Codon5: GGT (Gly); codon6: GTC (DNA) → mRNA GUC (Val); codon7: ACT → Thr.

Wait, so a shift here? The original codon6 is ACT (Thr), mutant6 is GTC (Val). Therefore:

Original codon structure after position13:

13 GGT (codon5, Gly)

16 ACT (codon6, Thr)

19 TCT (codon7, Ser)

In mutant3, after 10, perhaps 13 GGT, then next codon is GTG → GTG in DNA is GUG in mRNA (Val), then ACT. Wait, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, maybe Mutant3's sequence between the "GGT" and "ACT" has changed from original GGT ACT to GGT GTC ACT. So, between codon5 (GGT) and codon6 (ACT), GTC has been inserted? But if so, this would cause a frameshift if there’s an insertion. But looking at the provided sequences:

Mutant3: ...GGTGTCACT...

Original: ...GGTACT...

So the original had, after GGT comes ACT (i.e., GGTACT becomes the sequence). Mutant3 has GGTGTCACT. So the original separated as GGT ACT. Mutant3 is GGT GTC ACT. Wait, but that interpretation would mean that in the original, positions 16-18 are ACT and positions19-21 are TCT. In mutant3, they insert a GTC between GGT and ACT. Wait, that would be a duplication of GTC. Alternatively, perhaps comparing DNA sequences precisely:

Original from GGT ACT:

Positions13-15: GGT (positions13=G,14=G,15=T)

Then positions16-18: ACT (16=A,17=C,18=T)

Mutant3: After original positions13-15: GGT, then we have GTC (positions16-18: GTC), then act (positions19-21: ACT). So if the original sequence GGT  ACT (GGTA CT? How the letters are arranged.)

Wait, another approach. The mutant's sequence seems to add three nucleotides (GTC) between GGT and ACT. If that's the case, that's an insertion of three nucleotides (GGT GTC ACT instead of GGT ACT). Thus, inserting three nucleotides (GTC) would be an in-frame insertion, adding one amino acid (Val) after Gly. But this would not necessarily disrupt the reading frame, as the insertion is three nucleotides. Therefore, this would lead to the insertion of a Valine residue, but the rest of the sequence after would be in frame. However, if the protein tolerance varies, but unless critical regions are affected, this might not disable the protein completely.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different substitution here. Let me check the mutant3: original GGTACT becomes GGTGTCACT. So the original after GGT is ACT (positions16-18). Mutant3 substitutes the 'A' of ACT (position16) with 'GTC' to form GGTGTCACT, effectively changing the ACT to GTC, followed by ACT. Wait, perhaps this is an Insertion _and_ substitution, making it more complex.

If Mutant3 has inserted three extra nucleotides (GTC), causing an insertion of Val, and then ACT (Thr) as before. Alternatively, maybe at codon6 (original position16-18: ACT, Thr), it would now change to GTC (Val). That would be a missense mutation. However, overcomplicating—if indeed it's an insertion before ACT, the triplet insertion would not shift the frame. Hence, leading to one extra Val, but the rest of the sequence remains in reading frame. So the protein is longer by one amino acid here, but this might not significantly disrupt its function. 

So Mutant3 has a Leu→Tyr substitution in codon3 and an insertion of Val in codon5, leading to Gly > Gly, followed by Val, then Thr. Hmm. But this might not be as detrimental as a premature stop codon.

**Mutant4:** 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Comparing the two sequences:

Original has after ATG: TTTCTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: TTTTAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, the original:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...

So here, after the first TTT (codon2, Phe), the Mutant4 has TAC (DNA) → mRNA UAC (Tyr) in codon3 instead of original CTC → Leu. Also, in codon4, original GCT (Ala) is present in Mutant4. Then, at codon5, original GGT (Gly) is replaced by ACT (Thr). That would be another amino acid substitution. But also, there seems to be missing some nucleotides.

Wait, the provided mutant4 sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, exact comparison between the two:

Original positions:

4 T,5 T,6 T

7 C,8 T,9 C

10 G,11 C,12 T

13 G,14 G,15 T

16 A,17 C,18 T …

Mutant4:

4 T,5 T,6 T

7 T,8 A,9 C

10 G,11 C,12 T


13 A,14 C,15 T

16 T,17 C,18 T ...

Wait, from position13 onward:

Original was 13 G,14 G,15 T (GGT - Gly)

Mutant4: 13 A,14 C,15 T (ACT). So here, in codon5 (originally GGT) there's ACT (Thr). This could be a substitution from Gly to Thr.

But let's look at the entire sequence:

Original first split into triplets:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant4 triplets after ATG:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA …

So, codon3 in original (Leu/CUC) is now TAC/Tyr, and codon5 (Gly/GGT) becomes Thr/ACT. This is two missense mutations. The question is whether these significantly disrupt the protein. Two amino acid changes could cause partial loss of function, but again, unless those residues are critical, it's possible the protein retains some function.

Now, evaluating which mutation eliminates the protein.

Mutant1: Silent mutation (Leu→Leu) and a missense (Ala→Arg) = perhaps reduces activity.

Mutant2: Changes codon3 (Leu) to a stop codon (UAA), leading to a truncated protein of two amino acids (Met-Phe), which probably is entirely nonfunctional.

Mutant3: Two substitutions (Leu→Tyr and Thr→Val; plus extra insertion which adds an amino acid) → significant changes but maybe not enough to eliminate activity.

Mutant4: Two substitutions (Leu→Tyr and Gly→Thr) → could reduce but not eliminate.

Therefore, Mutant2 with the early termination codon is most likely to eliminate the protein product, hence stop the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. EMS often causes such nonsense mutations (when a TAA, TAG, or TGA codon appears due to point mutation). Therefore, Mutant2 likely introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional truncated protein.

Let me write down original and Mutant 1 sequences segment by segment.\n\nOriginal:\n\nATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A...\n\nWhich can be grouped as:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nMutant 1:\n\nATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nWait, so perhaps the difference is at the fourth nucleotide. Original after ATG is T T T C ..., whereas in mutant 1: T T C T...\n\nWait, perhaps filtering the first positions after ATG:\n\nOriginal gene: ATG followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...\n\nLet\'s see Mutant 1\'s sequence: same start, then changes? Wait no. Let\'s note that the user provided sequences as follows:\n\nOriginal gene:\n\n5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’\n\nMutant 1:\n\n5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’\n\nAh, yes. Comparing the sequences, at fourth through sixth nucleotides: original has TTT, mutant 1 has TTC (so the sixth base shifted from T to C in the coding strand? Wait. But need to note that DNA is written 5\' to 3\', so left to right, the sequence is in 5\' to 3\' direction. The coding sequence translates directly into mRNA via complementation, replacing T\'s with U\'s.\n\nOK, focusing on this:\n\nOriginal exon 1 starts with:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA …\n\nMutant 1:\n\nATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA …\n\nSo, the first codon after ATG (which is the start codon) in original is TTT, which is phe (F). In Mutant 1, TTT becomes TTC, which is still phe (since TTT and TTC both code for phenylalanine). Therefore, the first codon remains phe. \n\nBut then the next codon: Original is CTC, which in mRNA would be translated as codon CTT (if the DNA is in the coding strand). Wait, no—actually, after transcription from the coding strand (since DNA is 5\' to 3\' here), so mRNA would be 5\' AUG UUU CUG CGA CCA UGA ... wait, but wait, DNA is coding strand (complementary to template). Wait sorry, confusing here.\n\nWait, original DNA 5’ - ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... -3’.\n\nmRNA is complementary to the DNA\'s template strand, which is the reverse complement. However, since the DNA sequence provided is for the coding strand (the non-template strand, same as mRNA but with T\'s instead of U\'s), the mRNA would be 5\' AUG UUU CUG CGA CGG ... 3\'. Wait, no: the DNA sequence given is in the coding/sense strand (same as mRNA just T→U). So, the mRNA sequence for the original gene would be AUGUUUCUCGCUGGU... etc. So codons are: AUG (start), UUU (Phe), CUC (Leu), GCU (Ala), GGU (Gly), etc.\n\nIn Mutant 1, the DNA becomes ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT... So in mRNA, it\'s AUGCUCUAUCGCTGGT...? Wait TTC in DNA would be transcribed as AAG? No, wait—DNA strand is coding (sense) strand. Wait, here\'s the confusion: wait, the DNA has sequences written as they are; the template strand is the complementary one, and mRNA is synthesized complementary to the template. So if the gene is on the coding strand (the non-template), then the mRNA is the same as the coding strand but with U. Therefore, the mRNA for Original gene would have U in place of T. Hence:\n\nOriginal DNA: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... => mRNA is 5\' AUG UUU CUC GCU GGU ... 3\'\n\nMutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ... => mRNA is AUG UUC UAC GCU GGU ... \n\nIn the original, the first few codons (after start) UUU (F), CUC (L), GCU (A), GGU (G) etc. In Mutant 1, codons after start would be:\n\nFirst codon (after ATG is TTC in DNA -> UUC in mRNA, which is still Phe. Then codon TAC in DNA (UAC in mRNA) which is Tyr (Y). Original was CTC in DNA (CUC in mRNA: Leu). Then GCT (DNA) is still GCU in mRNA (Ala). So in Mutant 1, the second codon (originally Leu) becomes TAC / Tyr. \n\nSo in position 2 of the protein, Leu (original) is now Tyr. Thus, a missense mutation (Leu→Tyr). Whether this destroys the protein function depends, but usually, amino acid changes might abolish function if in a critical region, but another option could be a premature stop codon.\n\nMutant 2: the sequence provided is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGT..., so:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT\n\nMutant 2: TTA AGC TGG\n\nWait, DNA sequence is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ..., right?\n\nBreaking down:\n\nOriginal DNA (after ATG): TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant 2:\n\nATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ...\n\nWhich, in mRNA, would be AUG UUU CUA AGC UGG U...\n\nWait, how\'s that? Original TTT CTC:\n\nIn Mutant 2, after the initial TTT (positions 4-6), instead of CTC, we have TAA as triplet. Let me check:\n\nOriginal positions (for first 15 nucleotides): \n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...\n\nMutant 2: ATG T T C T A A G C T ...\n\nWait no: per user\'s description:\n\nMutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal: 4-6 TTT, 7-9 CTC, 10-12 GCT, 13-15 GGT, etc.\n\nMutant 2: TTA starting at position 7 perhaps? Let\'s actual see:\n\nOriginal (ATG) TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant 2: (ATG) TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...\n\nSo Mutant 2\'s DNA at positions 7-9 is TAA. So in mRNA, using coding DNA directly (since DNA here is coding), so TAA is a TAA in DNA, leading to TAA in transcript, meaning UAA. UAA is a stop codon. Therefore, in the protein, the mRNA would be AUG UUC UAA ..., which is start (Met), Phe, then STOP. Thus, a premature termination codon, causing a truncated protein, leading to a loss-of-function (likely knockout). This could eliminate the anti-nutritional compound if the protein is non-functional. Thus, mutant 2 has a premature stop codon in exon 1 (first exon), which would result in severely truncated protein. This is called a nonsense mutation.\n\nMutant 3\'s sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal sequence in early part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...\n\nMutant 3: ATG TTTTAC GCT GGt etc. Wait – to parse, perhaps originally:\n\nOriginal after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT..., any insertion or substitution?\n\nWait, the Mutant 3\'s beginning is \'ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTC\', while original is \'ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT." Wait, perhaps insertion?\n\nComparing first part of Mutant 3 to Original.\n\nOriginal:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...\n\nMutant3:\n\nATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...\n\nLooking at triplets:\n\nOriginal: after ATG, codons: TTT (F), CTC (L), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S)...\n\nMutant3: TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A), GGT (G), GTC (V), ACT (T)...\n\nSo here, the second codon original CTC (L) becomes TAC (Y). This is a missense mutation: Leu to Tyr. However, looking further, there’s a G heregious insertion? Wait, the user\'s assertion for Mutant3: yeah, the sequence is looking like perhaps an insertion of a T. Because as written:\n\nOriginal first part: CTGGTACTTCT (C T G G T A C T T C T ...)\n\nMutant3: CTGGTGTCACTTCT (C T G G T G T C A C T T C T ...) Thus, in position where original ACT becomes GTC and ACT?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s an insertion of GT: comparing the sequences vertically:\n\nOriginal exons DNA segment where:\n\nOriginal beginning part (2nd codon onwards).\n\nWait, maybe it\'s easier by looking for MUTATIONS caused in each case. Alternatively, perhaps there\'s a duplication or change in the DNA. For instance, "Mutant3: ...CTGGTGTCACTTCT..."\n\nOriginal sequence: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...\n\nMutant3\'s CTGGTGT is mapped as ...CTGGTGTCACTTCT... whereas original was perhaps CTGGTACT. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it\'s a frameshift? Wait, perhaps there\'s an insertion in mutant3. Looking back at user input sequences, mutate3 is described as: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ Original sequence: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nComparing between them, starting after ATGTTT, next in original it\'s CTC GCT (7-12 nts?), and in Mutant3 it becomes TAC GCT. Then GCT becomes modified. Wait, perhaps CTC in original has become TAC? That would mean: positional changes. Let\'s structure it properly.\n\nOriginal DNA (just nucleotides 1-25):\n\n1-15: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ...\nPositions:                        ^ ... up to here.\n\nMutant3:\n\n1-15: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG G...\n\nPositions 7-9 of original (CTC) becomes TAC: so that\'s a substitution. Then looking immediately next, original position 10-12 (GCT) stays the same, so again corresponding to GCT. Then, original positions 13-15 (GGT) in Mutant3 becomes GGT, but original positions 16-18 (ACT) become GTC, according to the sequence? Wait, in mutant3\'s sequence:\n\nOriginal \'ACT\' would be at offsets after GGT in DNA. For example, original:\n\nLooking at positions after GGT, where the original has ACT (positions 16-18).\n\nIn mutant3, after GGT we see GTC (positions 16-18) then ACT (positions 19-21). Thus, this seems like insertion of some nucleotides? Between GGT and ACT, instead of having ACT in positions 16-18, mutant3 has GTC ACT (i.e., GTC inserted before ACT). That would mean inserting three nucleotides (GTC), perhaps affecting the reading frame. Wait, no: inserting three nucleotides is an in-frame insertion, an insertion of one codon (here, from ACTTCT to GTCACTTCT – original positions 16-18: ACT; mutant3\'s positions 16-21 being GTC ACT. So comparing:\n\nOriginal: positions 13-15 GGT, then positions 16-18 ACT, whereas mutant3: positions13-15 GGT G T G... how is that?\n\nWait perhaps there\'s a more direct comparison. Let\'s line them up:\n\nOriginal:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA... \n\nMutant3:\n\nATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nAfter ATG TTT, original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant3: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...\n\nTherefore, the first three nucleotides after ATG TTT in original are CTC, in mutant3 they are TAC, so original positions 7-9 (CTC) are mutated to TAC.\n\nThen the remaining part: the original has GCT GGT ACT TCT..., whereas in mutant3: same GCT GGT is present, but then GTC ACT TCT. Original at positions 101Ratcl):\n\nOh, wait no: that’s an error perhaps. Let me count carefully. Awaiting clarification.\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG is:\n\nPositions 4-6 (all takes in 3-mers):\n\n4-6: TTT\n\n7-9: CTC\n\n10-12: GCT\n\n13-15: GGT\n\n16-18: ACT\n\n19-21: TCT\n\nIn mutant3:\n\nPositions 4-6: TTT\n\n7-9: TAC (changed from CTC to TAC)\n\n10-12: GCT\n\n13-15: GGT \n\n16-18: GTC (changed from ACT to GTC?)\n\nThen positions 19-21: ACT (original is here TCT?), confusion arises.\n\nWait, maybe in the original.\n\nWait, perhaps Mutant3\'s sequence at the beginning has inserted an extra T. Let me see using actual nt counts.\n\nOriginal sequence starts:\n\n1: ATG then positions 4-6 are TTT,\n\n7-9: CTC,\n\n10-12: GCT,\n\n13-15: GGT,\n\n16-18: ACT,\n\n19-21: TCT,...\n\nMutant3:\n\nLooking at the user-provided sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nBreaking down segments from the start:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nMutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nSo after ATG TTT (same first two codons), however a change occurs here:\n\nOriginal at 7-9: CTC becomes TAC.\n\nThen, GCT (10-12) stays, and then GGT (13-15) same.\n\nLane of GCTGGT is retained.\n\nNext, original in mutant3 has GTC inserted alongside ACT? Original element ACT becomes GTC, or insertion?\n\nWait, looking after GGT:\n\nOriginal, next is ACT, so triplet positions 16-18.\n\nBut in mutant3, it\'s GTC ACT...\n\nWait\' denotes that the sequence holds GTC ACT, where the original has ACT. Therefore, displacement? Probably insertion of three nucleotides (GTC), shifting the subsequent code.\n\nLet me check in terms of translational reading. \n\nOriginal ACT (positions 16-18 in original), codon becomes threonine (ACT→threonine).\n\nWhen we insert GTC before ACT in mutant3, the mRNA becomes GUC from coding GTC (Val). But wouldn\'t this affect the frame? Wait, insertion of three nucleotides (GTC) at positions 16-18 would introduce an in-frame insertion, leading to addition of one amino acid (Val) and pushing remaining codons, but in this case the sequence continues. For example, before the insertion, original codon (numbering):\n\nMet (1) - Phe (TTT, 2) - Leu (CTC,3) - Ala (GCT,4) - Gly (GGT,5) - Thr (ACT,6) ... Other words, mutant3: at codon 3 (originally Leu, CTC), mutated to Tyr (TAC: new codon positions -> TAC in mutant 3, explained as a triplet change to TAC. Elsewhere, there seems to be insertions? But after GGT, original codon6 (as listed above) is ACT (Thr), whereas in mutant3, GTC at the position (codon6), followed by ACT as codon7. \n\nThis would imply that mutant3 has inserted an amino acid at position6 (Val) and shifts the following codons? But ACT is native; oh no, inserted nucleotides are part of the triplet proceeding. Let me parse actual amino acids for original vs mutant3:\n\nOriginal mRNA:\n\ncodon1: AUG→met\n\ncodon2: UUU→phe\n\ncodon3: CUC→Leu\n\ncodon4: GCU→Ala\n\ncodon5: GGU→Gly\n\ncodon6: ACU→Thr\n\ncodon7: UGU→Cys\n\ncodon8: GGA→Gly\n\ncodon9: ...\n\nMutant3 mRNA:\n\ncodon1: AUG→met (same)\n\ncodon2: UUU→phe (same)\n\ncodon3: UAС→Tyr (changed from Leu)\n\ncodon4: GCU→Ala (same)\n\ncodon5: GGU→Gly (same)\n\ncodon6: GUC→Val (mutation via sequence change?)\n\ncodon7: ACU→Thr (original codon6 is in codon7)\n\nWait, inferring that between codons5 and6 in original, they inserted a new codon: GUC (Val), pushing the existing codons downstream by one. So codon6 (original Thr, ACU) is now at codon7.\n\nTherefore, structural change at codon3 (Leu → Tyr) and insertion of Val (codon6). Would this splice affect the protein function? Possibly, if these changes disturb an active site. However, such missense mutations might not necessarily knock out the enzyme function entirely. Frameshift is more disruptive, as would be in nonsense (stop codon) mutations.\n\nMutant4: sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’: original is first exon longer. Comparing:  original has ...GGTACTTCTGTGGATGA... while Mutant4: ...TGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGA...\n\nOriginal beginning is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... So, in Mutant4, after the TAC portion, sequences are missing the GGT. Wait, normal termination between GCT and ACT, perhaps deleting four nucleotides.\n\nBreaking  down, maybe :\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...\n\nSo between GCT and ACT, GGT is removed. How many nucleotides are missing? Between GCT (CCC...); actually, original sequence elements after CGCTGGT are transformed into CGCTACT. It appears that "GGTACTTCT" becomes "ACTTCT". Original eGGTACT (DNA fragments showing) to Mutant4\'s ACTTCT. Perhaps a deletion leading to omitted GGT.\n\nIn detailed alignment:\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions (exon1): after ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...\n\nMutant4:\n\nATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...\n\nThus, from position 10-12 (GCT) to position 13-15 in original: GGT; but mutant4 demonstrates that \'GCT\' (10-12) is followed by ACT (positions 13-15), so 3 nt GGT in original (positions13-15) is missing in mutant4. Thus, there is a deletion of GGT (3 nts). This would result in loss of codon GGT (Gly) at position5 (as in original), in the mutant.\n\nDepending on the reading frame, a deletion of 3 nt would lead to deletion of an amino acid (Gly) without disrupting the frame. Thus, results in a shorter protein by one amino acid (if frame maintained). The GGT codons are at a splice site? If gene has exons and introns, but the mutation is in Exon1, so here\'s the first exon. So the effect is in the exon codon. Loss of a single amino acid (Gly) at position5. Depending on the protein, a non-conservative missense mutation may or may not disrupt function, but perhaps if we have a removed amino acid, regardless, this might not entirely abolish the protein’s activity. However, it\'s a in-frame deletion, so like if the glycosylation site is intact.... unless codons begin differently.\n\nNow, our options are:\n\nMutant1: missense (Leu3→Tyr). Could hinder function but perhaps retaining partial activity.\n\nMutant2: introduces premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.\n\nMutant3: missense (Leu3→Tyr) and insertion of Val (additional valine in codon6), possibly disturbing structure.\n\nMutant4: In-frame deletion of the codon coding for Gly. Thus, one less amino acid but otherwise same downstream.\n\nWhich mutation most probably abolishes the gene\'s function?\n\nThe question states that the goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This would require disrupting gene function. Therefore, the best candidate is Mutant 2 which introduces a premature stop codon which truncates the protein. This would likely disable the enzyme that creates the anti-nutritional compound because the gene product is not fully formed. Truncated proteins are often non-functional, especially if the truncation occurs early in the coding sequence. So Mutant2 likely leads to no functional protein production, hence the anti-nutritional compound would not be synthesized, making that cultivar suitable for consumption.\n\nCheck other mutants. Mutant1, missense mutation could perturb the protein, but unless it\'s a key residue, enzymes often can still function or have reduced activity, but may still produce the compound. In some cases, a missense in critical active site could be disruptive, however, if uncertain, the stop codon is a safer bet.\n\nMutant3 adds an extra amino acid, but it\'s an insertion plus a substitution further upstream. If the active site is downstream, the enzyme might still function.\n\nMutant4 misses a codon, but again frame stays the same. Unless the Gly is crucial in structure, but in absence of specific info, most plausible complete knockout is premature stop, i.e., Mo answer.\n\nMitigate:\n\nCheck positions for Mutant2. How many amino acids would be made? In Mutant2, the allele has a stop codon in the original location after... let me confirm.\n\nMutant2 DNA sequence: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ...\n\nOriginal knockout in Second codon? After ATG. Original after ATG: TTC in first codon (where original was TTT), but then followed by TAA.\n\nATG TTC TAA GCT... translating to mRNA starting as: AUG UUC UA AGC UGG...\n\nAssuming DNa sequence for Mutant2 is used as per given:\n\nMutant2\'s mRNA would start: AUG UUC UAA G**....\n\nSo, the first codon (Met), second (Phe), third (UAA: Stop). So in codon3, right after codon1 (Met) and codon2 (Phe), codon3 is stop. So a very short protein (Met-Phe-Stop). Indeed, such a protein product would be non-functional because it is a mere dipeptide. That would eliminate the anti-nut production as the enzyme (gene product) is missing. Hence, Mutant2 is the best choice.\n\nSummarizing:\n\nMutant2 introduces a stop codon in the first exon, leading to a severely truncated protein, see important here—since the rest of the gene would not be translated, the enzyme won’t be produced.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

The most probable mutation that would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar is **Mutant 2**. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Analysis of Mutants:
1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - **Mutation**: A point mutation changes the third codon from **CTC (Leu)** to **TAC (Tyr)**.  
   - **Effect**: A conservative missense mutation. While this alters an amino acid, it is unlikely to fully disrupt the protein’s function unless the mutated residue is critical.  

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - **Mutation**: A point mutation causes the third codon (originally **CTC**) to become **TAA**, introducing a premature **stop codon (UAA** in mRNA).  
   - **Effect**: Translation terminates after the second codon (Met-Phe), producing a severely truncated protein. This loss-of-function mutation likely abolishes the enzyme responsible for synthesizing the anti-nutritional compound.  

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - **Mutation**: A missense mutation (Leu→Tyr) and an **in-frame insertion** of three nucleotides (GTC), adding a Valine residue.  
   - **Effect**: While the insertion disrupts the protein’s sequence, the reading frame remains intact. The enzyme might retain partial functionality.  

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - **Mutation**: An **in-frame deletion** of the **GGT** codon (Glycine).  
   - **Effect**: Removal of one amino acid, but the reading frame is preserved. This minor alteration may not completely inactivate the enzyme.  

### Conclusion:
**Mutant 2** introduces a **nonsense mutation** (premature stop codon), which truncates the protein early in the first exon. This results in a non-functional enzyme, effectively halting the production of the anti-nutritional compound. Other mutants involve missense mutations or in-frame changes that are less likely to fully abolish enzyme activity.

**Answer**: Mutant 2

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Hold on, perhaps better to compare the exact changes:

Wait, another approach. Let me write down original and Mutant 1 sequences segment by segment.

Original:

ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A...

Which can be grouped as:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1:

ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, so perhaps the difference is at the fourth nucleotide. Original after ATG is T T T C ..., whereas in mutant 1: T T C T...

Wait, perhaps filtering the first positions after ATG:

Original gene: ATG followed by TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Let's see Mutant 1's sequence: same start, then changes? Wait no. Let's note that the user provided sequences as follows:

Original gene:

5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Mutant 1:

5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’

Ah, yes. Comparing the sequences, at fourth through sixth nucleotides: original has TTT, mutant 1 has TTC (so the sixth base shifted from T to C in the coding strand? Wait. But need to note that DNA is written 5' to 3', so left to right, the sequence is in 5' to 3' direction. The coding sequence translates directly into mRNA via complementation, replacing T's with U's.

OK, focusing on this:

Original exon 1 starts with:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA …

Mutant 1:

ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA …

So, the first codon after ATG (which is the start codon) in original is TTT, which is phe (F). In Mutant 1, TTT becomes TTC, which is still phe (since TTT and TTC both code for phenylalanine). Therefore, the first codon remains phe. 

But then the next codon: Original is CTC, which in mRNA would be translated as codon CTT (if the DNA is in the coding strand). Wait, no—actually, after transcription from the coding strand (since DNA is 5' to 3' here), so mRNA would be 5' AUG UUU CUG CGA CCA UGA ... wait, but wait, DNA is coding strand (complementary to template). Wait sorry, confusing here.

Wait, original DNA 5’ - ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... -3’.

mRNA is complementary to the DNA's template strand, which is the reverse complement. However, since the DNA sequence provided is for the coding strand (the non-template strand, same as mRNA but with T's instead of U's), the mRNA would be 5' AUG UUU CUG CGA CGG ... 3'. Wait, no: the DNA sequence given is in the coding/sense strand (same as mRNA just T→U). So, the mRNA sequence for the original gene would be AUGUUUCUCGCUGGU... etc. So codons are: AUG (start), UUU (Phe), CUC (Leu), GCU (Ala), GGU (Gly), etc.

In Mutant 1, the DNA becomes ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT... So in mRNA, it's AUGCUCUAUCGCTGGT...? Wait TTC in DNA would be transcribed as AAG? No, wait—DNA strand is coding (sense) strand. Wait, here's the confusion: wait, the DNA has sequences written as they are; the template strand is the complementary one, and mRNA is synthesized complementary to the template. So if the gene is on the coding strand (the non-template), then the mRNA is the same as the coding strand but with U. Therefore, the mRNA for Original gene would have U in place of T. Hence:

Original DNA: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ... => mRNA is 5' AUG UUU CUC GCU GGU ... 3'

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ... => mRNA is AUG UUC UAC GCU GGU ... 

In the original, the first few codons (after start) UUU (F), CUC (L), GCU (A), GGU (G) etc. In Mutant 1, codons after start would be:

First codon (after ATG is TTC in DNA -> UUC in mRNA, which is still Phe. Then codon TAC in DNA (UAC in mRNA) which is Tyr (Y). Original was CTC in DNA (CUC in mRNA: Leu). Then GCT (DNA) is still GCU in mRNA (Ala). So in Mutant 1, the second codon (originally Leu) becomes TAC / Tyr. 

So in position 2 of the protein, Leu (original) is now Tyr. Thus, a missense mutation (Leu→Tyr). Whether this destroys the protein function depends, but usually, amino acid changes might abolish function if in a critical region, but another option could be a premature stop codon.

Mutant 2: the sequence provided is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGT..., so:

Original: TTT CTC GCT

Mutant 2: TTA AGC TGG

Wait, DNA sequence is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ..., right?

Breaking down:

Original DNA (after ATG): TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 2:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ...

Which, in mRNA, would be AUG UUU CUA AGC UGG U...

Wait, how's that? Original TTT CTC:

In Mutant 2, after the initial TTT (positions 4-6), instead of CTC, we have TAA as triplet. Let me check:

Original positions (for first 15 nucleotides): 

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...

Mutant 2: ATG T T C T A A G C T ...

Wait no: per user's description:

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to original:

Original: 4-6 TTT, 7-9 CTC, 10-12 GCT, 13-15 GGT, etc.

Mutant 2: TTA starting at position 7 perhaps? Let's actual see:

Original (ATG) TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 2: (ATG) TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

So Mutant 2's DNA at positions 7-9 is TAA. So in mRNA, using coding DNA directly (since DNA here is coding), so TAA is a TAA in DNA, leading to TAA in transcript, meaning UAA. UAA is a stop codon. Therefore, in the protein, the mRNA would be AUG UUC UAA ..., which is start (Met), Phe, then STOP. Thus, a premature termination codon, causing a truncated protein, leading to a loss-of-function (likely knockout). This could eliminate the anti-nutritional compound if the protein is non-functional. Thus, mutant 2 has a premature stop codon in exon 1 (first exon), which would result in severely truncated protein. This is called a nonsense mutation.

Mutant 3's sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original sequence in early part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...

Mutant 3: ATG TTTTAC GCT GGt etc. Wait – to parse, perhaps originally:

Original after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT..., any insertion or substitution?

Wait, the Mutant 3's beginning is 'ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTC', while original is 'ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT." Wait, perhaps insertion?

Comparing first part of Mutant 3 to Original.

Original:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Looking at triplets:

Original: after ATG, codons: TTT (F), CTC (L), GCT (A), GGT (G), ACT (T), TCT (S)...

Mutant3: TTT (F), TAC (Y), GCT (A), GGT (G), GTC (V), ACT (T)...

So here, the second codon original CTC (L) becomes TAC (Y). This is a missense mutation: Leu to Tyr. However, looking further, there’s a G heregious insertion? Wait, the user's assertion for Mutant3: yeah, the sequence is looking like perhaps an insertion of a T. Because as written:

Original first part: CTGGTACTTCT (C T G G T A C T T C T ...)

Mutant3: CTGGTGTCACTTCT (C T G G T G T C A C T T C T ...) Thus, in position where original ACT becomes GTC and ACT?

Alternatively, maybe there's an insertion of GT: comparing the sequences vertically:

Original exons DNA segment where:

Original beginning part (2nd codon onwards).

Wait, maybe it's easier by looking for MUTATIONS caused in each case. Alternatively, perhaps there's a duplication or change in the DNA. For instance, "Mutant3: ...CTGGTGTCACTTCT..."

Original sequence: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant3's CTGGTGT is mapped as ...CTGGTGTCACTTCT... whereas original was perhaps CTGGTACT. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's a frameshift? Wait, perhaps there's an insertion in mutant3. Looking back at user input sequences, mutate3 is described as: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ Original sequence: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing between them, starting after ATGTTT, next in original it's CTC GCT (7-12 nts?), and in Mutant3 it becomes TAC GCT. Then GCT becomes modified. Wait, perhaps CTC in original has become TAC? That would mean: positional changes. Let's structure it properly.

Original DNA (just nucleotides 1-25):

1-15: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ...
Positions:                        ^ ... up to here.

Mutant3:

1-15: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG G...

Positions 7-9 of original (CTC) becomes TAC: so that's a substitution. Then looking immediately next, original position 10-12 (GCT) stays the same, so again corresponding to GCT. Then, original positions 13-15 (GGT) in Mutant3 becomes GGT, but original positions 16-18 (ACT) become GTC, according to the sequence? Wait, in mutant3's sequence:

Original 'ACT' would be at offsets after GGT in DNA. For example, original:

Looking at positions after GGT, where the original has ACT (positions 16-18).

In mutant3, after GGT we see GTC (positions 16-18) then ACT (positions 19-21). Thus, this seems like insertion of some nucleotides? Between GGT and ACT, instead of having ACT in positions 16-18, mutant3 has GTC ACT (i.e., GTC inserted before ACT). That would mean inserting three nucleotides (GTC), perhaps affecting the reading frame. Wait, no: inserting three nucleotides is an in-frame insertion, an insertion of one codon (here, from ACTTCT to GTCACTTCT – original positions 16-18: ACT; mutant3's positions 16-21 being GTC ACT. So comparing:

Original: positions 13-15 GGT, then positions 16-18 ACT, whereas mutant3: positions13-15 GGT G T G... how is that?

Wait perhaps there's a more direct comparison. Let's line them up:

Original:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA... 

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

After ATG TTT, original: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Therefore, the first three nucleotides after ATG TTT in original are CTC, in mutant3 they are TAC, so original positions 7-9 (CTC) are mutated to TAC.

Then the remaining part: the original has GCT GGT ACT TCT..., whereas in mutant3: same GCT GGT is present, but then GTC ACT TCT. Original at positions 101Ratcl):

Oh, wait no: that’s an error perhaps. Let me count carefully. Awaiting clarification.

Original sequence after ATG is:

Positions 4-6 (all takes in 3-mers):

4-6: TTT

7-9: CTC

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT

16-18: ACT

19-21: TCT

In mutant3:

Positions 4-6: TTT

7-9: TAC (changed from CTC to TAC)

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT 

16-18: GTC (changed from ACT to GTC?)

Then positions 19-21: ACT (original is here TCT?), confusion arises.

Wait, maybe in the original.

Wait, perhaps Mutant3's sequence at the beginning has inserted an extra T. Let me see using actual nt counts.

Original sequence starts:

1: ATG then positions 4-6 are TTT,

7-9: CTC,

10-12: GCT,

13-15: GGT,

16-18: ACT,

19-21: TCT,...

Mutant3:

Looking at the user-provided sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking down segments from the start:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So after ATG TTT (same first two codons), however a change occurs here:

Original at 7-9: CTC becomes TAC.

Then, GCT (10-12) stays, and then GGT (13-15) same.

Lane of GCTGGT is retained.

Next, original in mutant3 has GTC inserted alongside ACT? Original element ACT becomes GTC, or insertion?

Wait, looking after GGT:

Original, next is ACT, so triplet positions 16-18.

But in mutant3, it's GTC ACT...

Wait' denotes that the sequence holds GTC ACT, where the original has ACT. Therefore, displacement? Probably insertion of three nucleotides (GTC), shifting the subsequent code.

Let me check in terms of translational reading. 

Original ACT (positions 16-18 in original), codon becomes threonine (ACT→threonine).

When we insert GTC before ACT in mutant3, the mRNA becomes GUC from coding GTC (Val). But wouldn't this affect the frame? Wait, insertion of three nucleotides (GTC) at positions 16-18 would introduce an in-frame insertion, leading to addition of one amino acid (Val) and pushing remaining codons, but in this case the sequence continues. For example, before the insertion, original codon (numbering):

Met (1) - Phe (TTT, 2) - Leu (CTC,3) - Ala (GCT,4) - Gly (GGT,5) - Thr (ACT,6) ... Other words, mutant3: at codon 3 (originally Leu, CTC), mutated to Tyr (TAC: new codon positions -> TAC in mutant 3, explained as a triplet change to TAC. Elsewhere, there seems to be insertions? But after GGT, original codon6 (as listed above) is ACT (Thr), whereas in mutant3, GTC at the position (codon6), followed by ACT as codon7. 

This would imply that mutant3 has inserted an amino acid at position6 (Val) and shifts the following codons? But ACT is native; oh no, inserted nucleotides are part of the triplet proceeding. Let me parse actual amino acids for original vs mutant3:

Original mRNA:

codon1: AUG→met

codon2: UUU→phe

codon3: CUC→Leu

codon4: GCU→Ala

codon5: GGU→Gly

codon6: ACU→Thr

codon7: UGU→Cys

codon8: GGA→Gly

codon9: ...

Mutant3 mRNA:

codon1: AUG→met (same)

codon2: UUU→phe (same)

codon3: UAС→Tyr (changed from Leu)

codon4: GCU→Ala (same)

codon5: GGU→Gly (same)

codon6: GUC→Val (mutation via sequence change?)

codon7: ACU→Thr (original codon6 is in codon7)

Wait, inferring that between codons5 and6 in original, they inserted a new codon: GUC (Val), pushing the existing codons downstream by one. So codon6 (original Thr, ACU) is now at codon7.

Therefore, structural change at codon3 (Leu → Tyr) and insertion of Val (codon6). Would this splice affect the protein function? Possibly, if these changes disturb an active site. However, such missense mutations might not necessarily knock out the enzyme function entirely. Frameshift is more disruptive, as would be in nonsense (stop codon) mutations.

Mutant4: sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’: original is first exon longer. Comparing:  original has ...GGTACTTCTGTGGATGA... while Mutant4: ...TGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGA...

Original beginning is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... So, in Mutant4, after the TAC portion, sequences are missing the GGT. Wait, normal termination between GCT and ACT, perhaps deleting four nucleotides.

Breaking  down, maybe :

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So between GCT and ACT, GGT is removed. How many nucleotides are missing? Between GCT (CCC...); actually, original sequence elements after CGCTGGT are transformed into CGCTACT. It appears that "GGTACTTCT" becomes "ACTTCT". Original eGGTACT (DNA fragments showing) to Mutant4's ACTTCT. Perhaps a deletion leading to omitted GGT.

In detailed alignment:

Original:

Positions (exon1): after ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Thus, from position 10-12 (GCT) to position 13-15 in original: GGT; but mutant4 demonstrates that 'GCT' (10-12) is followed by ACT (positions 13-15), so 3 nt GGT in original (positions13-15) is missing in mutant4. Thus, there is a deletion of GGT (3 nts). This would result in loss of codon GGT (Gly) at position5 (as in original), in the mutant.

Depending on the reading frame, a deletion of 3 nt would lead to deletion of an amino acid (Gly) without disrupting the frame. Thus, results in a shorter protein by one amino acid (if frame maintained). The GGT codons are at a splice site? If gene has exons and introns, but the mutation is in Exon1, so here's the first exon. So the effect is in the exon codon. Loss of a single amino acid (Gly) at position5. Depending on the protein, a non-conservative missense mutation may or may not disrupt function, but perhaps if we have a removed amino acid, regardless, this might not entirely abolish the protein’s activity. However, it's a in-frame deletion, so like if the glycosylation site is intact.... unless codons begin differently.

Now, our options are:

Mutant1: missense (Leu3→Tyr). Could hinder function but perhaps retaining partial activity.

Mutant2: introduces premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein.

Mutant3: missense (Leu3→Tyr) and insertion of Val (additional valine in codon6), possibly disturbing structure.

Mutant4: In-frame deletion of the codon coding for Gly. Thus, one less amino acid but otherwise same downstream.

Which mutation most probably abolishes the gene's function?

The question states that the goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. This would require disrupting gene function. Therefore, the best candidate is Mutant 2 which introduces a premature stop codon which truncates the protein. This would likely disable the enzyme that creates the anti-nutritional compound because the gene product is not fully formed. Truncated proteins are often non-functional, especially if the truncation occurs early in the coding sequence. So Mutant2 likely leads to no functional protein production, hence the anti-nutritional compound would not be synthesized, making that cultivar suitable for consumption.

Check other mutants. Mutant1, missense mutation could perturb the protein, but unless it's a key residue, enzymes often can still function or have reduced activity, but may still produce the compound. In some cases, a missense in critical active site could be disruptive, however, if uncertain, the stop codon is a safer bet.

Mutant3 adds an extra amino acid, but it's an insertion plus a substitution further upstream. If the active site is downstream, the enzyme might still function.

Mutant4 misses a codon, but again frame stays the same. Unless the Gly is crucial in structure, but in absence of specific info, most plausible complete knockout is premature stop, i.e., Mo answer.

Mitigate:

Check positions for Mutant2. How many amino acids would be made? In Mutant2, the allele has a stop codon in the original location after... let me confirm.

Mutant2 DNA sequence: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ...

Original knockout in Second codon? After ATG. Original after ATG: TTC in first codon (where original was TTT), but then followed by TAA.

ATG TTC TAA GCT... translating to mRNA starting as: AUG UUC UA AGC UGG...

Assuming DNa sequence for Mutant2 is used as per given:

Mutant2's mRNA would start: AUG UUC UAA G**....

So, the first codon (Met), second (Phe), third (UAA: Stop). So in codon3, right after codon1 (Met) and codon2 (Phe), codon3 is stop. So a very short protein (Met-Phe-Stop). Indeed, such a protein product would be non-functional because it is a mere dipeptide. That would eliminate the anti-nut production as the enzyme (gene product) is missing. Hence, Mutant2 is the best choice.

Summarizing:

Mutant2 introduces a stop codon in the first exon, leading to a severely truncated protein, see important here—since the rest of the gene would not be translated, the enzyme won’t be produced. Therefore, the anti-nut compound won't be synthesized, solving the problem.
