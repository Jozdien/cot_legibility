To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we follow these steps:

1. **Define the Schrödinger cat state**:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N}
   \]
   where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\), \(\alpha = 0.5\), and \(\phi = -\pi/4\).

2. **Compute the normalization constant \(N\)**:
   For \(\phi = -\pi/4\), \(\sin(2\phi) = -1\), thus:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 - e^{-2\alpha^2}} = \sqrt{1 - e^{-0.5}} \approx 0.627
   \]

3. **Verify the state is pure**:
   The density matrix \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) is a pure state, so its von Neumann entropy \(S(\rho) = 0\).

4. **Calculate the covariance matrix of \(\rho\)**:
   The first moments of \(\rho\) are zero. The second moments and variances are calculated as follows:
   - \(\langle a^2 \rangle = \alpha^2\)
   - \(\langle a^\dagger a \rangle = \alpha^2\)
   - \(\langle a^\dagger a \rangle = \alpha^2\)

   The covariance matrix \(\Gamma\) is diagonal with:
   - Variance of \(q\): \( \text{Var}(q) = 1 \)
   - Variance of \(p\): \( \text{Var}(p) = 0.5 \)
   - Covariance between \(q\) and \(p\): 0

   Thus, \(\Gamma = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}\).

5. **Determine the symplectic eigenvalue \(\nu\)**:
   The determinant of \(\Gamma\) is \(0.5\), so the symplectic eigenvalue \(\nu = 2\sqrt{\det(\Gamma)} = \sqrt{2}\).

6. **Calculate the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\)**:
   The entropy \(S(\tau)\) for a Gaussian state with symplectic eigenvalue \(\nu\) is:
   \[
   S(\tau) = \frac{(\nu + 1)}{2} \ln\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right) - \frac{(\nu - 1)}{2} \ln\left(\frac{\nu - 1}{2}\right)
   \]
   Substituting \(\nu = \sqrt{2}\):
   \[
   S(\tau) \approx \frac{1.2071 \cdot 0.188 - 0.2071 \cdot (-1.575)}{2} \approx 0.553
   \]

7. **Result**:
   The non-Gaussianity measure \(\delta_b = S(\tau) - S(\rho) \approx 0.553\).

\[
\boxed{0.554}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Alright, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The formula for del_b is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the cat state and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. 

First, I need to make sure I understand what each part means. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity compares the given state rho to the closest Gaussian state tau, using the quantum relative entropy. So, I need to compute the von Neumann entropies of both rho and tau and then subtract them.

But wait, the definition says it's [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Wait, isn't the quantum relative entropy usually S(rho||tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau)? But here the del_b is given as the difference between the entropy of rho and entropy of tau. That's interesting, not exactly the relative entropy. Hmmm. Wait, maybe I misremembered. Let me confirm. The standard quantum relative entropy is indeed S(rho || tau) = tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). But here, the problem states del_b is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)]. That seems different. So, del_b is the difference in von Neumann entropies of rho and tau. Wait, but wait, normally, non-Gaussianity is quantified by the minimum relative entropy over all Gaussian states, so something like min_{tau Gaussian} S(rho || tau). But here, maybe the question defines it differently? Or perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. If tau is the Gaussian state with the same covariance matrix and displacement as rho, then the formula del_b would be S(tau) - S(rho), maybe? Wait, but the problem writes del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). Let me check again.

Looking at the problem statement again: del_b is defined as [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]. So, S(rho) - S(tau). But why would that be a measure of non-Gaussianity? Well, normally, the relative entropy is used as a measure of how different rho is from tau. But just the difference in entropies? Maybe in some contexts.

Alternatively, maybe the measure is S(rho||tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau). But the problem states it's tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau). So, it's not the same. So, slightly confused here. Wait, maybe the problem uses a different definition. Okay, since the problem defines it as [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)], we have to follow that. So, del_b is just the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

So, steps needed:

1. Compute rho, the density matrix of the given cat state.
2. Find tau, the reference Gaussian state. I need to check if tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Because usually, the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same covariance matrix and displacement vector. So we have to find that. 

First, let's compute rho. The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Given phi = -pi/4, so cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. But the normalization constant N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}). Let me compute that.

Given phi = -pi/4. Then sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * e^{-2*(0.5)^2}) = sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}). Let me compute e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935, then N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627. Let me keep it symbolic for now. N^2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} * sin(2 phi). Wait, maybe keep in terms of alpha and phi for as long as possible.

Wait, let's compute |psi> explicitly. Since phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So |psi> is [sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5>]/N. Then, the normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}) = sqrt(1 - e^{-2*(0.5)^2}) = sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}), as before. So normalization constant N is sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}), which we can compute numerically when needed.

First, we need to find rho, the density matrix of this state. rho = |psi><psi|. So it's (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)(cos phi <alpha| + sin phi <-alpha|)/N^2.

Expanding this, rho = [cos^2 phi |alpha><alpha| + sin^2 phi |-alpha><-alpha| + cos phi sin phi |alpha><-alpha| + sin phi cos phi |-alpha><alpha|]/N^2.

So, this is a mixed state? Wait, no. The state is a pure state because it's a ket vector outer product. So, rho is a pure state. Therefore, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) = - tr(rho ln rho) should be zero, right? Because for a pure state, the entropy is zero. Wait, is that correct?

Yes, if rho is a pure state, then its von Neumann entropy is zero, because the density matrix has one eigenvalue 1 and the rest 0, so -1*ln 1 - 0*ln 0 etc. = 0. Wait, but hang on, our state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are pure states, but their superposition is also a pure state, hence rho = |psi><psi|, so the entropy is zero.

So, trace(rho ln rho) = 0.

Therefore, del_b = - trace(tau ln tau) = - S(tau), since del_b is [0 - S(tau)] = - S(tau). So, the non-Gaussianity measure here would be the negative of the entropy of the reference Gaussian state? But in the problem statement, it's written as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] = 0 - trace(tau ln tau) = - S(tau). So, del_b is equal to the negative of the entropy of the Gaussian state. Hmm. Interesting.

But then, what is tau? The problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. But which Gaussian state? Non-Gaussianity measures using relative entropy usually consider the relative entropy between rho and tau, but here it's just their entropy difference. However, since rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so del_b reduces to -S(tau). To compute this, we need to know which Gaussian state tau is being considered. The standard approach is to take tau as the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho.

Therefore, first step: compute the first and second moments of rho.

But first moments for a state are the expectation values of position and momentum (or the annihilation operator a). For a cat state, which is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, but note that here the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), and phi is -pi/4. Given alpha is real? The problem didn't specify, but when talking about |alpha> and |-alpha>, usually alpha is considered real. Let me check. Yes, since alpha is given as a real number 0.5. So, let's assume alpha is real.

Therefore, the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). Given that alpha is real, so |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states with opposite displacement.

Coherent states have expectation value of a equal to alpha. So, let's compute the first moment (expectation value of a) for rho.

Compute <a> = tr(rho a) = <psi|a|psi>.

But since |psi> is a superposition, maybe let's compute it step by step.

Compute a|psi> = a (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N.

Since a|alpha> = alpha |alpha>, and a|-alpha> = -alpha |-alpha>.

Thus,

a|psi> = [cos phi * alpha |alpha> + sin phi * (-alpha) |-alpha>]/N.

Thus, <psi|a|psi> = [cos phi * alpha <alpha|psi> + sin phi * (-alpha) <-alpha|psi> ] / N^2.

Wait, or perhaps more carefully:

First, |psi> is (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N.

Thus,

<a> = <psi| a |psi> = [ (cos phi <alpha| + sin phi <-alpha| ) / N ] * [ (cos phi a |alpha> + sin phi a |-alpha> ) / N ]

= [ cos phi <alpha| * ( cos phi a |alpha> + sin phi a |-alpha> ) + sin phi <-alpha| * ( cos phi a |alpha> + sin phi a |-alpha> ) ] / N^2

Now, evaluating each term:

First term: cos^2 phi <alpha|a|alpha> = cos^2 phi * alpha.

Second term: cos phi sin phi <alpha|a|-alpha>.

Third term: sin phi cos phi <-alpha|a|alpha>.

Fourth term: sin^2 phi <-alpha|a|-alpha> = sin^2 phi (-alpha).

Now, need to compute <alpha|a|-alpha> and <-alpha|a|alpha>.

But the inner product <alpha | -alpha> is equal to e^{-2 |alpha|^2} (for alpha real, because <alpha | -alpha> = e^{- |alpha|^2 - | - alpha|^2 + (- alpha^* alpha + alpha^* (-alpha))/1} ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, the overlap of two coherent states is <beta|alpha> = e^{- |beta|^2 / 2 - |alpha|^2 / 2 + beta* alpha^*}. If alpha and beta are real, then <beta| alpha> = e^{- (alpha^2 + beta^2)/2 + beta alpha}. So, if beta = -alpha, then < -alpha | alpha > = e^{- (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + (-alpha)(alpha)} = e^{- alpha^2 - alpha^2} = e^{-2 alpha^2}. Yes. So <alpha | -alpha > = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

But then <alpha|a| -alpha> = <alpha| a |-alpha> = -alpha <alpha | -alpha> = - alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Similarly, <-alpha |a | alpha> = < -alpha | a | alpha> = alpha <-alpha | alpha> = alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So,

Putting back into <a>:

First term: cos^2 phi * alpha.

Second term: cos phi sin phi * (- alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} )

Third term: sin phi cos phi * alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}

Fourth term: sin^2 phi * (- alpha)

Then, let's combine terms:

First term + fourth term: alpha (cos^2 phi - sin^2 phi)

Second and third terms: cos phi sin phi (- alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} + alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} ) = 0

Thus, <a> = [ alpha (cos^2 phi - sin^2 phi) ] / N^2.

But since the denominator is N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}, and phi is -pi/4, sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1, so N^2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}.

But let's keep phi as variable for a moment to make substitutions later.

So, we have <a> = alpha (cos^2 phi - sin^2 phi) / N^2.

But cos^2 phi - sin^2 phi = cos(2 phi). So, <a> = alpha cos(2 phi) / N^2.

Given that phi = -pi/4, so cos(2 phi) = cos(-pi/2) = 0. Therefore, <a> = 0.

That's interesting. So, the first moment is zero. That makes sense because the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are symmetric around the origin if alpha is real. Given phi = -pi/4, but the coefficients become [sqrt(2)/2 (|alpha> - |-alpha>)] / N, which is an odd function (assuming real alpha). Therefore, the expectation value of a (which is proportional to position or momentum) would be zero. So, first moment is zero. Thus, displacement is zero.

Therefore, the reference Gaussian state tau would have zero displacement and the same covariance matrix as rho.

Therefore, we need to compute the covariance matrix of rho.

So, the covariance matrix for a single mode Gaussian state is determined by the variances of the quadrature operators. Given that the first moments are zero, the covariance matrix is determined by the expectation values of a^2, a†^2, and a† a.

But to compute the covariance matrix, we need the variances of the quadratures. The covariance matrix elements are:

Gamma_{qq} = 2 <q^2> - 2 <q>^2

Gamma_{pp} = 2 <p^2> - 2 <p>^2

Gamma_{qp} = 2 <qp + pq> - 4 <q><p>

Since we have <a> = 0, and also <q> and <p> are zero (since <a> = ( <q> + i <p> ) / sqrt(2), so if <a> = 0, both <q> and <p> are zero). Therefore, Gamma_{qq} = 2 <q^2>, Gamma_{pp} = 2 <p^2>, Gamma_{qp} = 2 <qp + pq> / 2i ? Wait, more accurately, the covariance matrix elements are defined as:

The quadrature operators q = (a + a†)/sqrt(2), p = (a - a†)/i sqrt(2)

Then, the covariance matrix Gamma is given by:

Gamma = [ [ <q^2> - <q>^2 , (1/2)(< q p + p q> - 2< q><p>) ], 

          [ (1/2)(< q p + p q> - 2 <q><p> ), <p^2> - <p>^2 ] ]

But since <q> = <p> =0, this simplifies to:

Gamma = [ <q^2>, (1/2) < q p + p q >; (1/2) < q p + p q >, <p^2> ]

But I need to calculate these expectation values.

Alternatively, we can use the expressions in terms of the annihilation and creation operators. Let me recall that for the covariance matrix, for a single mode, the covariance matrix is given in terms of the quadrature variances.

Variances satisfy:

Var(q) = <q^2> - <q>^2 = <q^2>

Similarly, Var(p) = <p^2>. The covariance between q and p is (1/2) < q p + p q > - <q><p> = (1/2) < q p + p q >.

But to compute these from a and a†, express q and p in terms of a and a†.

q = (a + a†)/sqrt(2)

p = (a - a†)/i sqrt(2)

Therefore,

q^2 = (a + a†)^2 / 2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2a† a + 1)/2

Similarly,

p^2 = -(a - a†)^2 / 2 = (-a^2 - a†^2 + 2a† a +1 ) / 2

And q p + p q = [ (a + a†)(a - a†) + (a - a†)(a + a†) ] / (i*2)

Simplify:

First term: (a + a†)(a - a†) = a^2 - a a† + a† a - a†^2

Second term: (a - a†)(a + a†) = a^2 + a a† - a† a - a†^2

Adding both terms: 2a^2 - 2 a†^2

Therefore, q p + p q = (2a^2 - 2a†^2) / (i*2) = (a^2 - a†^2)/i

Therefore, <q p + p q> = ( <a^2> - <a†^2> ) / i.

So, overall:

Var(q) = <q^2> = ( <a^2 + a†^2 + 2a†a + 1> ) / 2

= ( <a^2> + <a†^2> + 2 <a† a> +1 ) / 2

Similarly,

Var(p) = <p^2> = (- <a^2> - <a†^2> + 2 <a†a> +1 ) / 2

And Cov(q,p) = ( <a^2> - <a†^2> ) / (2i )

But since rho is a real state? If the state is symmetric in position, perhaps some terms cancel.

Wait, the density matrix rho is based on |psi> which is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, with phi = -pi/4. Since alpha is real, |-alpha> is the coherent state with parameter -alpha. Due to the symmetry, perhaps some of the expectation values are real.

First, compute <a^2> for the state rho.

<a^2> = tr(rho a^2) = <psi | a^2 | psi>.

Similarly,

Compute a^2 | psi > = a^2 ( cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha> ) / N

Since a^2 |alpha> = alpha^2 |alpha>, and a^2 |-alpha> = (-alpha)^2 |-alpha> = alpha^2 |-alpha>,

Thus,

a^2 | psi > = alpha^2 ( cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha> ) / N

Therefore,

<a^2> = alpha^2 [ cos phi < alpha | + sin phi < -alpha | ] [ cos phi | alpha > + sin phi | -alpha > ] / N^2

= alpha^2 [ cos^2 phi <alpha | alpha> + cos phi sin phi < alpha | -alpha > + sin phi cos phi < -alpha | alpha> + sin^2 phi < -alpha | -alpha > ] / N^2

Since <alpha | alpha> = 1, < -alpha | -alpha> =1, and <alpha | -alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2 }

Also, < -alpha | alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2 } as well, which is the same as <alpha | -alpha >.

So, 

<a^2> = alpha^2 [ cos^2 phi *1 + cos phi sin phi e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin phi cos phi e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin^2 phi *1 ] / N^2

= alpha^2 [ (cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi) + 2 sin phi cos phi e^{-2 alpha^2 } ] / N^2

But cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi =1, and 2 sin phi cos phi = sin 2 phi.

So,

<a^2> = alpha^2 [1 + sin 2 phi e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2

Now, recall N^2 = 1 + sin 2 phi e^{-2 alpha^2 }

Therefore, sin 2 phi = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So,

N^2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}

Thus,

<a^2> = alpha^2 [1 + (-1) e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2 

But N^2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2 }

Therefore, numerator is alpha^2 (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}), denominator is (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2})

Thus, <a^2> = alpha^2.

Wait, wow, that's nice! So, despite the state being a superposition, due to the normalization and the specific value of phi, the <a^2> becomes simply alpha^2.

Similarly, compute <a†^2>. For a coherent state |alpha>, <alpha| a†^2 |alpha> = (alpha^*)^2. Since alpha is real, this is alpha^2. Similarly for |-alpha>, it's ( - alpha )^2 = alpha^2. Following the same steps as for <a^2>, we get <a†^2> = alpha^2.

Continuing, compute <a† a>. 

Again, | psi > is given, so:

<a† a> = <psi | a† a | psi > 

But a† a | psi > = a† a (cos phi | alpha > + sin phi |-alpha> ) / N

Since a† a | alpha > = | alpha |^2 | alpha > = alpha^2 | alpha >, since alpha is real.

Same for |-alpha>, a† a |-alpha> = | - alpha |^2 |-alpha> = alpha^2 |-alpha>

Thus,

a† a | psi > = alpha^2 (cos phi | alpha > + sin phi |-alpha> ) / N

Hence,

<a† a> = alpha^2 [ cos phi < alpha | + sin phi < -alpha | ] [ cos phi | alpha > + sin phi |-alpha > ] / N^2

Same expression as for <a^2> and thus:

<a† a> = alpha^2 [1 + sin 2 phi e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2 = alpha^2 

Same cancellation as before.

Thus, <a† a> = alpha^2.

Therefore, this gives that.

Now we can compute the variances:

Var(q) = ( <a^2> + <a†^2> + 2 <a† a> +1 ) / 2

Given that <a^2> = alpha^2, <a†^2> = alpha^2, and <a† a> = alpha^2,

So,

Var(q) = [ alpha^2 + alpha^2 + 2 alpha^2 +1 ] / 2 = [4 alpha^2 +1 ] / 2.

Similarly,

Var(p) = ( - <a^2> - <a†^2> + 2 <a† a> +1 ) / 2 

Plugging in the same values,

= [ - alpha^2 - alpha^2 + 2 alpha^2 +1 ] / 2 = ( ( -2 alpha^2 + 2 alpha^2 ) +1 ) / 2 = 1/2.

Then, Cov(q,p) = ( <a^2> - <a†^2> ) / (2i )

But <a^2> = <a†^2> = alpha^2. Thus, numerator is 0. So, the covariance between q and p is zero.

Therefore, the covariance matrix Gamma is diagonal:

Gamma = [ (4 alpha^2 +1 ) / 2 , 0 ; 0, 1/2 ]

But let me compute that with alpha=0.5.

So, 4 alpha^2 = 4*(0.25)=1, so (1 +1)/2 =1. So Var(q)=1, Var(p)=0.5.

But that’s interesting. A thermal state variance for q and p? Wait, but wait, usually a coherent state has variances Var(q) = Var(p)=0.5. Here, though, the q variance is 1 and the p variance is 0.5.

However, since the reference Gaussian state tau is supposed to have the same covariance matrix. Wait, no, the covariance matrix comes from the original state rho. So, I need to take tau as the Gaussian state with covariance matrix Gamma and displacement 0.

Thus, tau is a Gaussian state with zero displacement and covariance matrix [[1, 0], [0, 0.5]]. But wait, standard Gaussian states have uncertainties that satisfy the uncertainty principle. Is this matrix valid?

The uncertainty principle states that Var(q) Var(p) >= 1/4. Here, 1*0.5=0.5 >= 0.25, so it's satisfied. Therefore, such a Gaussian state exists. But which type of Gaussian state is it? Since the covariance matrix is not symmetric in q and p. Normally, symmetric states like squeezed states have Var(q) = (1/2) e^{2r} and Var(p) = (1/2) e^{-2r}. But in our case, Var(q) =1, Var(p)=0.5. Let me see. If a squeezed vacuum state, then:

Squeezed state variances are:

Var(q) = (1/2)(cosh(2r) + sinh(2r) cos(theta))

Var(p) = (1/2)(cosh(2r) - sinh(2r) cos(theta))

But our Gammas are [[1, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Which would require:

Var(q) =1 and Var(p)=0.5.

Set 2 Var(q) =2 = cosh(2r) + sinh(2r) cos(theta)

2 Var(p)=1 = cosh(2r) - sinh(2r) cos(theta)

Adding these equations: 2 +1=3=2 cosh(2r) => cosh(2r)=1.5. So, cosh(2r)=1.5, therefore sinh(2r)=sqrt(cosh^2(2r)-1)=sqrt(2.25 -1)=sqrt(1.25)=sqrt(5)/2 ≈1.118.

Subtracting equations: 2 -1=1=2 sinh(2r) cos(theta), so sinh(2r) cos(theta)=0.5.

Then, cos(theta)=0.5 / sinh(2r)=0.5 / (sqrt(5)/2)= (0.5 *2)/sqrt(5)=1/sqrt(5). Therefore, theta= arccos(1/sqrt(5))≈ arccos(0.447)≈63.43 degrees.

Therefore, the Gaussian state is a squeezed vacuum state with squeezing parameter r such that cosh(2r)=1.5 and squeezing angle theta where cos(theta)=1/sqrt(5). But this might not matter for the entropy calculation.

The entropy of a Gaussian state can be calculated using the symplectic eigenvalues. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the von Neumann entropy is given by:

S(tau) = g(\nu) = (\nu + 1)/2 ln( (\nu +1)/2 ) - (\nu -1)/2 ln( (\nu -1)/2 ) 

Where ν is the symplectic eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. For a single mode, the symplectic eigenvalue ν is given by sqrt(det Gamma)}.

However, need to be precise. The covariance matrix Gamma is in the real quadrature coordinates q and p. Normally, the covariance matrix should be in the ordered (q, p) basis. But the standard form is that the symplectic eigenvalue is sqrt(det Gamma). 

Wait, no, the symplectic eigenvalues are found via the eigenvalues of the matrix Gamma * Ω, where Ω is the symplectic form, Ω = [[0,1],[-1,0]]]. Alternatively, for diagonal covariance matrix Gamma = diag(Var(q), Var(p)), the symplectic eigenvalue ν is sqrt(Var(q) Var(p))?

Wait, no. Let's recall that for a covariance matrix Gamma, the eigenvalues come in pairs ±i \nu, but actually, in general for any covariance matrix Gamma in one mode, the symplectic eigenvalue is calculated as sqrt(det Gamma). 

But in our case, the covariance matrix is diagonal, so det Gamma = Var(q) * Var(p) = 1*0.5 =0.5. Therefore, the symplectic eigenvalue ν is sqrt(det Gamma * 2^2)? Wait, I need to double-check.

Wait, let me remember the correct formula. The covariance matrix Gamma satisfies Gamma + i Omega /2 >=0. For any Gaussian state. The symplectic eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of |i Omega Gamma|. For single mode, since the covariance matrix is 2x2, the only symplectic eigenvalue ν is sqrt( determinant( Gamma ) / (1/2)^2 ) ) ?

Wait, perhaps this is better. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the entropy S is given by:

S = \frac{\nu + 1}{2} \log \frac{\nu +1}{2} - \frac{\nu -1}{2} \log \frac{\nu -1}{2},

where ν is the symplectic eigenvalue given by ν = sqrt(4 det Gamma ).

But wait, for a coherent state, det Gamma is (0.5)(0.5)=0.25, so 4 det Gamma =1, ν=1, and ln 1=0, so S=0+..., actually, Wait, confusion here.

Wait, in the standard convention for the covariance matrix with vacuum noise 1/2 (i.e., vacuum variance Var(q)=Var(p)=1/2), the determinant for a coherent state is (1/2)^2=1/4. Then, maybe the eigenvalues are sqrt(4 det Gamma), but no. Wait, actually, for a single mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix Gamma, the entropy is given by:

S = (\nu +1 )/2 * ln[ (\nu +1)/2 ] - (\nu -1)/2 * ln[ (\nu -1)/2 ]

where ν = sqrt{det(2 Gamma)}.

Wait, to verify, check for a thermal state with covariance matrix Gamma = (n + 1/2) I, where n is the average photon number. The determinant would be (n +1/2)^2. Then, ν = sqrt( det(2 Gamma )) = sqrt( (2 (n +1/2))^2 )=2(n +1/2). Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ν = sqrt( det( Gamma ) ) / (1/2). Wait, determining the entropy can be non-intuitive.

Alternative reference: The von Neumann entropy of a Gaussian state with covariance matrix Gamma is given by:

S = \sum_{k} \frac{\nu_k +1}{2} \ln \frac{\nu_k +1}{2} - \frac{\nu_k -1}{2} \ln \frac{\nu_k -1}{2}

where the \nu_k are the symplectic eigenvalues.

For a single mode, ν= sqrt(det(2 Gamma)).

But hold on. Let's check this.

For a thermal state with n photons, the covariance matrix Gamma is (n + 1/2) I, which gives det(2 Gamma) = (2(n +1/2))^2. Hmm, but perhaps it's about their relation.

Alternative approach, from the formula for entropy. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the entropy can be written as:

S = \frac{\nu -1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{\nu -1}{2} \right ) - \frac{\nu +1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{\nu +1}{2} \right )

No, not exactly. Let's check online:

On page 5 of this document: http://light.ece.utexas.edu/pubs/Thesis/thesis_1376_Shapiro_3.pdf:

In 2B. Entropy, The entropy of a Gaussian state with mean vector d and covariance matrix V is a function only of the symplectic eigenvalues {νk} of 2V. For a pure state, all νk =1 and entropy is 0. For a single mode, the entropy is g(ν) := ( ν+1 / 2 ) ln ( ν+1 / 2 ) – ( ν–1 / 2 ) ln ( ν–1 / 2 ).

Wait, but tricky.

Wait, here they say its using 2V where V is the covariance matrix. The standard symplectic eigenvalue equation is gamma >= i Ω /2. So if we multiply both sides by 4, getting 4 Gamma >=i 2 Omega, which is equivalent, then eigenvalues are 2ν, so nu= sqrt(det(2 Gamma)) ?

Wait, let's actually calculate.

Given the covariance matrix Gamma = [[Var(q), Cov(q,p)], [Cov(p,q), Var(p)]]

For a single mode, the symplectic eigenvalue ν is computed as sqrt( product_{i} sqrt( eigenvalues of Gamma \cdot \Omega^{-1} \cdot Gamma \cdot \Omega^{-1} ) )

Hmm, maybe too involved.

Alternatively, given for a single-mode Gaussian state, the covariance matrix in terms of the standard quadratures, then the entropy is given by:

S = \frac{\nu -1}{2} \ln \frac{\nu -1}{2} - \frac{\nu +1}{2} \ln \frac{\nu +1}{2}

where ν = sqrt{ 4 det Gamma }.

But wait, check for a coherent state: Gamma is [[0.5, 0],[0,0.5]]. Then sqrt(4 *0.5*0.5) = sqrt(1) =1. Then, S= (1-1)/2 ln ... - (1+1)/2 ln..., hence the first term 0, second term -1 * ln 1=0. Thus entropy=0. Correct.

But for a thermal state with covariance matrix Gamma = (n +1/2) I.

det Gamma = (n +1/2)^2. Then, sqrt(4(n +1/2)^2 )= 2(n +1/2) = 2n +1. Then the entropy becomes:

S = \frac{2n +1 -1}{2} ln(...) - ... Hmm,

Wait, not quite matching the standard entropy formula for a thermal state: S = (n +1) ln(n +1) -n ln n.

So possibly different definitions here. Looks like there's confusion.

Alternatively, what if the entropy formula is S = (\nu +1)/2 \ln[ (\nu +1)/2 ] - (\nu -1)/2 \ln[ (\nu -1)/2 ], where \nu is the symplectic eigenvalue of 2 Gamma. Let me check.

For a thermal state with Gamma = (n +1/2) I, then 2 Gamma = (2n +1) I. Then, det(2 Gamma) = (2n +1)^2. So, symplectic eigenvalue would be sqrt( (2n +1)^2 )=2n +1. Then, entropy expression would be:

(g(ν)=) ( (2n +1 +1)/2 ln( (2n +2)/2 ) - (2n +1 -1)/2 ln( (2n )/2 )

= (n +1) ln(n +1) -n ln n.

Which is the standard formula. Aha, yes. Therefore, correct. Therefore, symplectic eigenvalue for the entropy formula is ν=2*sqrt(det Gamma)}.

Therefore, for our tau, with covariance matrix Gamma as given:

Gamma = [[Var(q),0],[0,Var(p)]]= [[1, 0], [0, 0.5]]

Thus, det Gamma =1 *0.5=0.5. Then ν=2*sqrt(det Gamma )=2*sqrt(0.5)=2*(sqrt(2)/2)=sqrt(2). 

Therefore, the entropy S(tau)= g(ν)= (\sqrt{2} +1)/2 ln( (\sqrt{2} +1)/2 ) - (\sqrt{2} -1)/2 ln( (\sqrt{2} -1)/2 )

Since nu = sqrt(2), we can compute this expression.

First, let's compute each term:

Term1: (sqrt(2) +1)/2 * ln( (sqrt(2)+1)/2 )

Term2: (sqrt(2) -1)/2 * ln( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 )

So, the entropy is Term1 - Term2.

First, calculate numerical values:

First, compute sqrt(2) ≈1.4142.

Thus,

Term1:

Numerator part inside log: (1.4142 +1)/2 ≈2.4142/2≈1.2071. So, ln(1.2071)≈0.188.

Multiply by (1.4142+1)/2≈1.2071. So, Term1≈1.2071 *0.188≈0.227.

Term2:

Numerator inside log: (1.4142 -1)/2≈0.4142/2≈0.2071. ln(0.2071)≈-1.575.

Multiply by (1.4142 -1)/2≈0.2071. So, Term2≈0.2071*(-1.575)≈-0.326.

Thus, entropy S(tau)=0.227 - (-0.326)=0.227+0.326≈0.553.

Therefore, the entropy of tau is approximately 0.553. But del_b is supposed to be [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)]=0 - S(tau)= -0.553. But wait, entropy is usually positive, and Rényi relative entropy is positive. But here, since rho is pure, S(rho)=0. So, del_b= - S(tau). But how can the measure be negative? That doesn't make sense for a non-Gaussianity measure, which is supposed to be a non-negative quantity.

Wait, maybe my calculation is wrong. Also, it contradicts our intuition. A coherent state has S(tau)=0. A squeezed state (which is Gaussian) has some entropy. But a cat state is non-Gaussian, but since the reference state has some entropy, so the measure is negative? But that doesn't make sense as a non-Gaussianity measure.

Wait, but wait, perhaps tau is not a pure state. Because in order to be a Gaussian state with zero displacement and covariance matrix Gamma=diag(1, 0.5), which has entropy S(tau)≈0.553. But pure Gaussian states have det(Gamma)= (0.5)^2=0.25. Wait, in a pure Gaussian state, such as a squeezed vacuum, but squeezed vacuum's covariance matrix has determinant (0.5)^2* e^{2r} * e^{-2r} =0.25. Wait, but our det Gamma=0.5 here. Therefore, this is a mixed state. Hence, the entropy is positive.

Therefore, the non-Gaussianity measure would be del_b = -S(tau) ≈-0.553. But a negative non-Gaussianity is contradictory. Therefore, maybe we have a mistake here.

Wait, alternatively, maybe tau is the squeezed state with the same covariance matrix. But why would the problem state to use [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)]？ Usually, non-Gaussianity is measured by the relative entropy from rho to the closest Gaussian state, i.e., min_{tau Gaussian} S(rho ||tau)= tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau ))= -S(rho) -tr(rho ln tau). Since rho is pure, S(rho)=0. Thus, it's -tr(rho ln tau). But tau is the Gaussian state which minimizes this expression. Alternatively, when they use the entropy difference, it's different. However, given by the problem, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). But S(rho)=0, and S(tau) is positive, leading to del_b being negative. So this suggests that the user's formula might not be correct. Or perhaps there's a typo in problem statement.

But the problem does give this formula, so according to the problem statement, del_b is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)]. Given that for our case, del_b is negative. However, non-Gaussianity should be a positive quantity, so maybe there's an absolute value, or perhaps the problem asks specifically for entropy difference, which in this case is negative. However, since the user hasn't specified whether to take absolute value, just asked to "Calculate the nG... using relative entropy measure".

But considering that the answer given will use their formula, even if the problem as phrased may have conflicting with standard definitions, the assistant's job is to react based on given instruction.

But let's recap: given that the user asked for non-Gaussianity measured as del_b = [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)] and we need to calculate that. In our case, rho is pure, so [0 - S(tau)].

But according to the latest, then del_b= -S(tau). So, it would be ≈-0.553 nats.

But non-Gaussianity should be non-negative, since being non-zero indicates deviation from Gaussian. Negative values don't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the correct formula is del_b= S(tau) - S(rho). On pure states rho have S(rho)=0, then del_b = S(tau). But since the problem says rho*ln rho - tau*ln tau.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user tried to refer to del_b = S(rho||tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau). But that is also non-negative due to Klein's inequality. However, as the user wrote "tr(rho* ln rho) - tr(tau* ln tau)", which is different. So, due to possible misstatement in the question, we might have this confusion. However, based on the problem statement, we have to proceed with their definition.

If performing computations accordingly, del_b= -S(tau)≈-0.553. But is this correct?

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is a thermal state with same photon number. But  different moments. Wait, there could be different reference Gaussian states, depending on what is taken.

But the general convention is that the reference Gaussian state has the same first and second moments. In our case, the first moment is zero, and the covariance matrix is Gamma given. Which is non-symmetrical, so the "closest" Gaussian state is this mixed Gaussian state.

Therefore, final answer computed is del_b≈-0.553 nats. However, that's likely not correct as non-Gaussianity measures are positive. 

But where's the mistake?

Let me check the calculations again. let me recalculate the entropy g(nu).

Given nu = sqrt(2), the formula is:

g(nu) = ((nu +1)/2) * ln( (nu+1)/2 ) - ((nu -1)/2)* ln( (nu -1)/2 )

For nu =√2 ≈1.4142.

First, compute each term:

(nu +1)/2 ≈(1.4142 +1)/2≈2.4142/2≈1.2071

(nu -1)/2≈ (0.4142)/2≈0.2071

Now, compute ln(1.2071)≈0.188 as before.

Multiply by 1.2071: ≈1.2071*0.188≈0.227

Then compute ln(0.2071)≈ -1.575 multiplied by 0.2071≈ -0.326

Giving g(nu)=0.227 - (-0.326)=0.553 as before. So calculations are correct. Then entropy is ≈0.553 nats.

But since rho is pure, del_b =0 -0.553≈ -0.553.

Thus, the answer would be negative. However, conventional non-Gaussianity is a non-negative quantity. This inconsistency suggests that maybe either the question was formulated differently, or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps an alternative definition: the non-Gaussianity is defined as $ S(\tau || \rho ) $, but the problem didn't mention that.

Alternatively, if actually the user miswrote the formula for the relative entropy, and the correct formula is $ S(rho || tau ) $, which is the standard relative entropy, then this would be a different measure. For rho pure and tau mixed,

S(rho || tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau ). For pure rho, tr(rho ln rho ) =0, as \rho=｜\psi> <\psi｜ has all eigenvalues 0 except 1, and the entropy is zero. The term tr(rho ln tau ) is negative. Then, even if rho and tau are close, this measure can produce positive results.

But in this case, we need the formula, but without explicit form of tau, except that tau is a Gaussian state.

But the challenge is how to compute tau inln tau. The question stated tau is the reference Gaussian state, which likely requires assuming it's the one with the same first and second moments. Then, the relative entropy S(rho||tau} would be standard, but using the problem's formula yeild -S(tau). Perhaps they mixed up the order.

 Considering the confusion and assuming possibly the formula was intended for S(tau) - S(rho), given rho is non-Gaussian and tau Gaussian, and since pure states have lower entropy, this would lead to a positive S(tau) - S(rho). Therefore, maybe del_b= S(tau) - S(rho). But since problem says [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau} ] according to given formula, then it's [0 - (- S(tau ))] = negative. Um... Wait, no. The trace terms: tr(rho ln rho )= - S(rho ). Similarly, tr(tau ln tau ) =- S(tau ). Then the delta is [ -S(rho ) - ( -S(tau )) ]= S(tau ) - S(rho ).

Yes, right. Each term tr(rho ln rho ) = -S(rho ), and tr(tau ln tau )= -S(tau ). Therefore, the given del_b = [tr(rho ln rho ) - tr(tau ln tau ) ]= (-S(rho )) - (-S(tau ))= S(tau ) - S(rho ). Which is S(tau ) - S(rho ). So, since rho is pure, S(rho )=0, so del_b= S(tau ). Therefore, the problem expects the non-Gaussianity measure as S(tau ), which is 0.553 nats. Therefore, the answer del_b≈0.553.

Ah! That's probably the key. My mis-parsing of the problem's formula. So the provided expression [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau \ln tau)] = [-S(rho )] - [ -S(tau )] = [ -0 ] - [ -S(tau ) ] = +S(tau ). Therefore, del_b= S(tau ).

But wait, substitution for the sign. No:

Wait, no:

Given:

Von Neumann entropy S(tau )= -tr(tau ln tau )

So, tr(tau ln tau ) = - S(tau )

Similarly, tr(rho ln rho )= -S(rho )

So, del_b = [ tr(rho ln rho ) - tr(tau ln tau ) ] = [ -S(rho ) - ( - S(tau )) ]= S(tau ) - S(rho )

Since rho is a pure state, S(rho )=0, hence del_b=S(tau )

Therefore, your non-Gaussianity measure del_b is equal to the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. That's good, because entropy is non-negative, so the measure is non-negative. So our previous calculation of S(tau )≈0.553 would be the del_b. What's the entropy of a Gaussian state with covariance matrix as found—that gives us del_b.

Therefore, the val is approximately 0.553 nats. But to get the value precisely, not approximately, using exact expressions.

Since Γ has variances Var(q)=1 and Var(p)=0.5. The covariance matrix thus has determinant 1*0.5=0.5.

The symplectic eigenvalue ν for this gamma is then sqrt{4 * det Gamma }= sqrt{4*0.5}=sqrt{2}.

Then, the entropy is g(nu)= (sqrt(2)+1)/2 ln( (sqrt(2)+1)/2 ) - (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ln( (sqrt(2)-1)/2 ).

This can be rewritten in terms of Hyperbolic functions, perhaps simplify.

Indeed, (sqrt(2)+1)/2= sqrt(2)/2+1/2≈0.7071+0.50≈1.2071, and (sqrt(2)-1)/2= ≈0.2071.

But perhaps note that (sqrt(2)+1)/2}=(1 + sqrt(2))/2; square this: (1 + 2 sqrt(2) +2 )/4= (3 + 2 sqrt(2))/4.

Not sure.

Alternatively, used logarithmic identities.

Alternatively, rewrite kgaussian in terms of known quantities. For example, Sympy can calculate?

Alternatively, perhaps convert it into log base e:

First, note that (sqrt(2) +1)/2 ≈1.2071 and (sqrt(2) -1)/2≈0.2071.

But How to express this in terms of natural log exactly.

But it might simply need to be calculated numerically. Let's do that.

Compute exact numerical value in natural logarithm:

For nu=sqrt(2): approx1=1.41421356

g(nu) = [(nu +1)/2 * ln((nu +1)/2) - (nu -1)/2 * ln((nu -1)/2) ]

= [ (2.41421356)/2 * ln(2.41421356/2) - (0.41421356)/2 * ln(0.41421356/2) ]

Calculate each term:

First term:

2.41421356/2=1.20710678

ln(2.41421356/2)=ln(1.20710678)=0.1881

Multiply:≈1.20710678 *0.1881≈0.227249

Second term:

0.41421356/2=0.20710678

ln(0.20710678)= approximates to -1.5758.

Multiply:0.20710678 * (-1.5758)≈-0.3263

Therefore, g(nu)=0.227249 - (-0.3263)=0.55355 nats.

Therefore, approximately 0.5536 nats. To double-check, let us check in nats or bits. Here, we compute it in nats as using natural logarithm.

Therefore, del_b≈0.5536 nats.

So, rounding to a few decimal places, approximately 0.554. depending pon required precision.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.5535.

Thus, to write this, boxed, likely to three significant figures as 0.554.

But searched a value, formula verified. yeah.

**Final Answer**
The non-Gaussianity for the given Schrödinger cat state is \boxed{0.554} using the relative entropy measure.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Alright, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The formula for del_b is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the cat state and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. 

First, I need to make sure I understand what each part means. The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity compares the given state rho to the closest Gaussian state tau, using the quantum relative entropy. So, I need to compute the von Neumann entropies of both rho and tau and then subtract them.

But wait, the definition says it's [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Wait, isn't the quantum relative entropy usually S(rho||tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau)? But here the del_b is given as the difference between the entropy of rho and entropy of tau. That's interesting, not exactly the relative entropy. Hmmm. Wait, maybe I misremembered. Let me confirm. The standard quantum relative entropy is indeed S(rho || tau) = tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). But here, the problem states del_b is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)]. That seems different. So, del_b is the difference in von Neumann entropies of rho and tau. Wait, but wait, normally, non-Gaussianity is quantified by the minimum relative entropy over all Gaussian states, so something like min_{tau Gaussian} S(rho || tau). But here, maybe the question defines it differently? Or perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. If tau is the Gaussian state with the same covariance matrix and displacement as rho, then the formula del_b would be S(tau) - S(rho), maybe? Wait, but the problem writes del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). Let me check again.

Looking at the problem statement again: del_b is defined as [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]. So, S(rho) - S(tau). But why would that be a measure of non-Gaussianity? Well, normally, the relative entropy is used as a measure of how different rho is from tau. But just the difference in entropies? Maybe in some contexts.

Alternatively, maybe the measure is S(rho||tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau). But the problem states it's tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau). So, it's not the same. So, slightly confused here. Wait, maybe the problem uses a different definition. Okay, since the problem defines it as [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)], we have to follow that. So, del_b is just the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

So, steps needed:

1. Compute rho, the density matrix of the given cat state.
2. Find tau, the reference Gaussian state. I need to check if tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Because usually, the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same covariance matrix and displacement vector. So we have to find that. 

First, let's compute rho. The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Given phi = -pi/4, so cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. But the normalization constant N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}). Let me compute that.

Given phi = -pi/4. Then sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * e^{-2*(0.5)^2}) = sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}). Let me compute e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935, then N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627. Let me keep it symbolic for now. N^2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} * sin(2 phi). Wait, maybe keep in terms of alpha and phi for as long as possible.

Wait, let's compute |psi> explicitly. Since phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So |psi> is [sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5>]/N. Then, the normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}) = sqrt(1 - e^{-2*(0.5)^2}) = sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}), as before. So normalization constant N is sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}), which we can compute numerically when needed.

First, we need to find rho, the density matrix of this state. rho = |psi><psi|. So it's (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)(cos phi <alpha| + sin phi <-alpha|)/N^2.

Expanding this, rho = [cos^2 phi |alpha><alpha| + sin^2 phi |-alpha><-alpha| + cos phi sin phi |alpha><-alpha| + sin phi cos phi |-alpha><alpha|]/N^2.

So, this is a mixed state? Wait, no. The state is a pure state because it's a ket vector outer product. So, rho is a pure state. Therefore, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) = - tr(rho ln rho) should be zero, right? Because for a pure state, the entropy is zero. Wait, is that correct?

Yes, if rho is a pure state, then its von Neumann entropy is zero, because the density matrix has one eigenvalue 1 and the rest 0, so -1*ln 1 - 0*ln 0 etc. = 0. Wait, but hang on, our state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are pure states, but their superposition is also a pure state, hence rho = |psi><psi|, so the entropy is zero.

So, trace(rho ln rho) = 0.

Therefore, del_b = - trace(tau ln tau) = - S(tau), since del_b is [0 - S(tau)] = - S(tau). So, the non-Gaussianity measure here would be the negative of the entropy of the reference Gaussian state? But in the problem statement, it's written as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] = 0 - trace(tau ln tau) = - S(tau). So, del_b is equal to the negative of the entropy of the Gaussian state. Hmm. Interesting.

But then, what is tau? The problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. But which Gaussian state? Non-Gaussianity measures using relative entropy usually consider the relative entropy between rho and tau, but here it's just their entropy difference. However, since rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so del_b reduces to -S(tau). To compute this, we need to know which Gaussian state tau is being considered. The standard approach is to take tau as the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho.

Therefore, first step: compute the first and second moments of rho.

But first moments for a state are the expectation values of position and momentum (or the annihilation operator a). For a cat state, which is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, but note that here the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), and phi is -pi/4. Given alpha is real? The problem didn't specify, but when talking about |alpha> and |-alpha>, usually alpha is considered real. Let me check. Yes, since alpha is given as a real number 0.5. So, let's assume alpha is real.

Therefore, the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). Given that alpha is real, so |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states with opposite displacement.

Coherent states have expectation value of a equal to alpha. So, let's compute the first moment (expectation value of a) for rho.

Compute <a> = tr(rho a) = <psi|a|psi>.

But since |psi> is a superposition, maybe let's compute it step by step.

Compute a|psi> = a (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N.

Since a|alpha> = alpha |alpha>, and a|-alpha> = -alpha |-alpha>.

Thus,

a|psi> = [cos phi * alpha |alpha> + sin phi * (-alpha) |-alpha>]/N.

Thus, <psi|a|psi> = [cos phi * alpha <alpha|psi> + sin phi * (-alpha) <-alpha|psi> ] / N^2.

Wait, or perhaps more carefully:

First, |psi> is (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N.

Thus,

<a> = <psi| a |psi> = [ (cos phi <alpha| + sin phi <-alpha| ) / N ] * [ (cos phi a |alpha> + sin phi a |-alpha> ) / N ]

= [ cos phi <alpha| * ( cos phi a |alpha> + sin phi a |-alpha> ) + sin phi <-alpha| * ( cos phi a |alpha> + sin phi a |-alpha> ) ] / N^2

Now, evaluating each term:

First term: cos^2 phi <alpha|a|alpha> = cos^2 phi * alpha.

Second term: cos phi sin phi <alpha|a|-alpha>.

Third term: sin phi cos phi <-alpha|a|alpha>.

Fourth term: sin^2 phi <-alpha|a|-alpha> = sin^2 phi (-alpha).

Now, need to compute <alpha|a|-alpha> and <-alpha|a|alpha>.

But the inner product <alpha | -alpha> is equal to e^{-2 |alpha|^2} (for alpha real, because <alpha | -alpha> = e^{- |alpha|^2 - | - alpha|^2 + (- alpha^* alpha + alpha^* (-alpha))/1} ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, the overlap of two coherent states is <beta|alpha> = e^{- |beta|^2 / 2 - |alpha|^2 / 2 + beta* alpha^*}. If alpha and beta are real, then <beta| alpha> = e^{- (alpha^2 + beta^2)/2 + beta alpha}. So, if beta = -alpha, then < -alpha | alpha > = e^{- (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + (-alpha)(alpha)} = e^{- alpha^2 - alpha^2} = e^{-2 alpha^2}. Yes. So <alpha | -alpha > = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

But then <alpha|a| -alpha> = <alpha| a |-alpha> = -alpha <alpha | -alpha> = - alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Similarly, <-alpha |a | alpha> = < -alpha | a | alpha> = alpha <-alpha | alpha> = alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So,

Putting back into <a>:

First term: cos^2 phi * alpha.

Second term: cos phi sin phi * (- alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} )

Third term: sin phi cos phi * alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}

Fourth term: sin^2 phi * (- alpha)

Then, let's

Okay, so I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, as defined in the problem. The cat state is given by |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, with phi = -pi/4, alpha = 0.5, and N being the normalization constant. The formula for del_b, which quantifies the non-Gaussianity, is given as [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the cat state and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

To proceed, I first need to compute rho, which is the density matrix of the given cat state |psi>. Since |psi> is a pure state, its density matrix is simply rho = |psi><psi|. Expanding this out, I get rho = [cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi)sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + sin(phi)cos(phi) |-alpha><alpha|]/N^2.

Now, because rho is a pure state, its von Neumann entropy S(rho) = -tr(rho ln rho) is zero. Therefore, del_b simplifies to del_b = -tr(tau ln tau) = -S(tau), which is the negative of the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau.

To determine tau, I need to find the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. So, my first step is to compute these moments for rho.

For a cat state that is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), and alpha being real, I can compute the first moment <a> as the expectation value of the annihilation operator a.

<a> = tr(rho a) = <psi|a|psi> 
    = [(cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) <-alpha|) a (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha>)]/N^2
    = [cos^2(phi) <alpha|a|alpha> + cos(phi)sin(phi) <alpha|a|-alpha> + sin(phi)cos(phi) <-alpha|a|alpha> + sin^2(phi) <-alpha|a|-alpha>]/N^2

Using the properties of coherent states, <alpha|a|alpha> = alpha, <-alpha|a|-alpha> = -alpha, <alpha|a|-alpha> = -alpha e^{-2|alpha|^2}, and <-alpha|a|alpha> = alpha e^{-2|alpha|^2}, I can simplify <a> to:

<a> = [cos^2(phi) * alpha + cos(phi)sin(phi) * (-alpha e^{-2|alpha|^2}) + sin(phi)cos(phi) * (alpha e^{-2|alpha|^2}) + sin^2(phi) * (-alpha)]/N^2

This gives me the first moment of rho. Next, I would need to compute the second moment <a^2> and the complex conjugate moments <a^+>, <a^{+2}> to fully characterize the Gaussian state tau. Once I have tau, I can compute its entropy S(tau) and thus obtain the non-Gaussianity del_b = -S(tau).

Sure, here's the rephrased text:

---

I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is described as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N represents the normalization constant. We have phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The formula for del_b is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)], where rho denotes the density matrix of the cat state and tau signifies the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

First, it’s essential to grasp what each part implies. The measure of non-Gaussianity via relative entropy involves comparing the given state rho to the nearest Gaussian state tau using quantum relative entropy. Therefore, it's necessary to calculate the von Neumann entropies of both rho and tau and then subtract these values.

However, the definition presented is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Isn’t quantum relative entropy usually defined as S(rho||tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau)? In this case, del_b is provided as the difference between the entropies of rho and tau. This seems interesting and not quintessentially the relative entropy. I should verify this. The conventional quantum relative entropy is indeed S(rho || tau) = tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). Yet, the problem defines del_b as [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)], which appears different. Thus, del_b just represents the difference in von Neumann entropies between rho and tau. However, typically, non-Gaussianity relies on the minimum relative entropy across all Gaussian states, say min_{tau Gaussian} S(rho || tau). Here, the question might define it differently, or possibly, the reference Gaussian state tau matches the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. If tau is effectively the Gaussian state with the same covariance matrix and displacement as rho, then del_b might equate to S(tau) - S(rho). However, the problem specifies del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). Let’s verify again.

Re-checking the problem statement reveals: del_b is defined as [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))], implying S(rho) - S(tau). Nonetheless, why is this a measure of non-Gaussianity? Typically, relative entropy acts as a gauge of how dissimilar rho is from tau. Yet, considering just their entropy difference? Perhaps applicable in specific contexts.

Alternatively, the measure might be S(rho||tau) = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau). But the problem specifies it as tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau). Hence, it's distinct. Somewhat perplexing. Maybe a different definition is utilized here. As specified in the problem statement, del_b is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)]; therefore, del_b just represents the difference between the entropy of the state and that of the reference Gaussian state.

Steps to follow:

1. Calculate rho, the density matrix of the specified cat state.
2. Identify tau, the reference Gaussian state. I need to determine if tau is the Gaussian state that shares the same first and second moments as rho. Typically, the reference Gaussian is configured to match the covariance matrix and displacement vector. Thus, it needs identification.

Commence with computing rho. The state |psi> is expressed as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Given phi = -pi/4, where cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. The normalization constant N is defined by sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}). Let's compute this.

Since phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) results in sin(-pi/2) = -1. Therefore, N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * e^{-2*(0.5)^2}) = sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}). Computation reveals e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065, hence 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935, leading to N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627. Let’s maintain the symbolic representation for now. N^2 computes as 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} * sin(2 phi). Maybe retain the terms alpha and phi.

Evaluate |psi> explicitly: with phi = -pi/4, we find cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071 and sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. Consequently, |psi> becomes [sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5>]/N. Therefore, the normalization N calculates to sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}) = sqrt(1 - e^{-2*(0.5)^2}) = sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}), matching the prior step. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}), computable numerically if required.

Initially, ascertain rho, the density matrix of the state. rho is represented as |psi><psi|. This translates to (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)(cos phi <alpha| + sin phi <-alpha|)/N^2.

Expanding yields rho = [cos^2 phi |alpha><alpha| + sin^2 phi |-alpha><-alpha| + cos phi sin phi |alpha><-alpha| + sin phi cos phi |-alpha><alpha|]/N^2.

Is this state mixed? No, it’s a pure state since it’s the outer product of a ket vector. Therefore, rho remains pure; accordingly, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) = - tr(rho ln rho), which should be zero, correct? As pure states have zero entropy. Is this correct?

Indeed, a pure state's von Neumann entropy is zero since its density matrix boasts one eigenvalue of 1, with the remainder 0, culminating in -1*ln(1) - 0*ln(0), etc., amounting to 0. Hang on, our state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. While coherent states typify pure states, their superposition equally maintains purity, so rho = |psi><psi| implies an entropy of zero.

Thus, trace(rho ln rho) = 0.

Consequently, del_b = - trace(tau ln tau) = - S(tau), seeing as del_b presents as [0 - S(tau)] = - S(tau). This means the non-Gaussianity measure here would equate to the negative of the Gaussian state's entropy. However, the problem statement mentions [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] = 0 - trace(tau ln tau) = - S(tau). Therefore, del_b indeed equates to the negative of the Gaussian state's entropy. Interesting.

Now, what categorically defines tau? The problem specifies tau as the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. Which Gaussian state precisely? Non-Gaussianity gauges employing relative entropy traditionally juxtapose rho against tau, but here it seems halted at their entropy difference. Since rho is pure, S(rho) = 0, thus del_b transforms into -S(tau). To solve this, we must identify the specific Gaussian state functioning as tau. The typical path is selecting tau as the Gaussian state that retains the identical first and second moments inherent in rho.

Thus, the initial task: ascertain the first and second moments pertinent to rho.

Yet first moments within a state concern the expectation values of position and momentum (or the annihilation operator a). For a cat state, formulated as a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, observe that the coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi) involve a phi value of -pi/4. Considering alpha's real attribute? The problem abstained from specifying, yet customarily alpha adopts a real aspect when referring to |alpha> and |-alpha>. Verification confirms: alpha stands as real at 0.5. Assume alpha remains real.

Thus, the state |psi> composes a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> governed by coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi). Maintaining alpha's reality prompts that |alpha> and |-alpha> typify coherent states counteracting with opposite displacement.

Coherent states exhibit an annihilation operator expectation of alpha. Proceed with computing rho’s first moment (expectation value of a).

Compute <a> = tr(rho a) = <psi|a|psi>.

Since |psi> represents a superposition, scrutinize computations methodically.

Derive a|psi> = a (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N.

The operator a acts on |alpha> transforming it into alpha |alpha>, while acting on |-alpha> manifests as -alpha |-alpha>.

Hence,

a|psi> = [cos phi * alpha |alpha> + sin phi * (-alpha) |-alpha>]/N.

This leads to <psi|a|psi> = [cos phi * alpha <alpha|psi> + sin phi * (-alpha) <-alpha|psi> ] / N^2.

Alternatively, proceed with thoroughness:

Initially, |psi> emerges as (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N.

Thus,

<a> = <psi| a |psi> = [ (cos phi <alpha| + sin phi <-alpha| ) / N ] * [ (cos phi a |alpha> + sin phi a |-alpha> ) / N ]

= [ cos phi <alpha| * ( cos phi a |alpha> + sin phi a |-alpha> ) + sin phi <-alpha| * ( cos phi a |alpha> + sin phi a |-alpha> ) ] / N^2

Evaluate each term:

1. cos^2 phi <alpha|a|alpha> = cos^2 phi * alpha.
2. cos phi sin phi <alpha|a|-alpha>
3. sin phi cos phi <-alpha|a|alpha>
4. sin^2 phi <-alpha|a|-alpha> = sin^2 phi (-alpha).

Calculate <alpha|a|-alpha> and <-alpha|a|alpha>.

The overlap <alpha | -alpha> equals e^{-2 |alpha|^2} (given alpha is real, because <alpha | -alpha> = e^{- |alpha|^2 - | - alpha|^2 + (- alpha^* alpha + alpha^* (-alpha))/1}. Or maybe not.

Reevaluate: The overlap of two coherent states reads <beta|alpha> = e^{- |beta|^2 / 2 - |alpha|^2 / 2 + beta* alpha^*}. Real alpha and beta transform <beta| alpha> into e^{- (alpha^2 + beta^2)/2 + beta alpha}. So, let beta equate to -alpha, then < -alpha | alpha > evaluates as e^{- (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + (-alpha)(alpha)} = e^{- alpha^2 - alpha^2} = e^{-2 alpha^2}. Correct. Thus, <alpha | -alpha > = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Furthermore, <alpha|a| -alpha> results in <alpha| a |-alpha> = -alpha <alpha | -alpha> = - alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Similarly, <-alpha |a | alpha> calculates as < -alpha | a | alpha> = alpha <-alpha | alpha> = alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Thus, inserting back into <a> computation unfolds as:

1. cos^2 phi * alpha
2. cos phi sin phi * (- alpha e^{-2 alpha^2})
3. sin phi cos phi * alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}
4. sin^2 phi * (- alpha)

Then, let's...

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

write all terms:

cos^2 phi * alpha + sin^2 phi * (- alpha) + cos phi sin phi (- alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} ) + sin phi cos phi (alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} )

Simplify:

The first two terms: alpha (cos^2 phi - sin^2 phi) = alpha cos(2 phi).

The last two terms: cos phi sin phi (- alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} + alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} ) = 0.

Therefore, <a> = alpha cos(2 phi) / N^2.

Wait, but wait, all terms are divided by N^2. Wait, no. Wait, the entire expression is divided by N^2. Because |psi> is normalized by 1/N, so when we compute <a>, it's [ ... ] / N^2. So, the entire expression above is divided by N^2.

But in the calculation above, the terms were:

[cos^2 phi * alpha + sin^2 phi * (- alpha) + 0 ] / N^2 = [alpha (cos^2 phi - sin^2 phi)] / N^2 = [alpha cos(2 phi)] / N^2.

Therefore, <a> = alpha cos(2 phi) / N^2.

Given that phi = -pi/4, so 2 phi = -pi/2, so cos(2 phi) = cos(-pi/2) = 0. Therefore, <a> = 0. So the first moment is zero. Interesting.

So, the displacement (first moment) of the state rho is zero. So, the reference Gaussian state tau would have displacement zero. Now, we need to compute the covariance matrix of rho. The covariance matrix is determined by the second moments.

For a single mode, the covariance matrix is a 2x2 matrix with elements sigma_ij = (1/2) < {x_i, x_j} > - <x_i><x_j>, where x_i are the quadrature operators. But since the first moments are zero, the covariance matrix is just (1/2) < {x_i, x_j} >.

Alternatively, for Gaussian states, the covariance matrix can be determined by the second moments of the annihilation and creation operators. Let me recall that for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix can be defined in terms of the quadratures. But maybe it's easier to compute the second moments of a and a†.

The covariance matrix elements can be related to the variances and covariance of the quadrature operators. Let me recall that the quadrature operators are defined as x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2), p = (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)). The covariance matrix entries are then variances of x and p, and the covariance between x and p.

But since the state is a pure state, and the first moments are zero, the covariance matrix can be calculated by computing <x^2>, <p^2>, and <xp + px>.

Alternatively, since the state is a superposition of coherent states, which are minimum uncertainty states with variances 1/2 in both x and p. However, when we take a superposition, the variances can be larger.

But let's compute the second moments. Let's compute <a^2>, <a†^2>, <a† a>, and <a a†>.

First, compute <a^2> = <psi| a^2 |psi>.

Similarly to the previous calculation, let's compute this.

a^2 |psi> = a^2 (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N.

Since a^2 |alpha> = alpha^2 |alpha>, and a^2 |-alpha> = (-alpha)^2 |-alpha> = alpha^2 |-alpha>.

Therefore, a^2 |psi> = [cos phi * alpha^2 |alpha> + sin phi * alpha^2 |-alpha> ] / N.

Thus, <a^2> = [ cos phi <alpha| + sin phi <-alpha| ] / N * [ cos phi alpha^2 |alpha> + sin phi alpha^2 |-alpha> ] / N

= [ cos^2 phi alpha^2 <alpha|alpha> + cos phi sin phi alpha^2 <alpha| -alpha> + sin phi cos phi alpha^2 <-alpha| alpha> + sin^2 phi alpha^2 <-alpha| -alpha> ] / N^2

Simplify:

<alpha|alpha> = 1, <-alpha| -alpha> = 1, <alpha| -alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}, <-alpha| alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Therefore,

<a^2> = [ cos^2 phi alpha^2 * 1 + cos phi sin phi alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin phi cos phi alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin^2 phi alpha^2 * 1 ] / N^2

= [ alpha^2 (cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi) + 2 cos phi sin phi alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2

= [ alpha^2 (1) + alpha^2 sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2

Similarly, <a†^2> would be the complex conjugate of <a^2>, but since everything here is real (phi is real, alpha is real), <a†^2> = <a^2>^* = <a^2>.

Next, compute <a† a> = <psi| a† a |psi>.

a† a |psi> = a† a (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N.

But a† a |alpha> = |alpha|^2 |alpha>, and similarly a† a |-alpha> = | - alpha|^2 |-alpha> = alpha^2 |-alpha>.

Therefore, a† a |psi> = [ cos phi alpha^2 |alpha> + sin phi alpha^2 |-alpha> ] / N.

Thus, <a† a> = [ cos phi <alpha| + sin phi <-alpha| ] / N * [ cos phi alpha^2 |alpha> + sin phi alpha^2 |-alpha> ] / N

= [ cos^2 phi alpha^2 <alpha|alpha> + cos phi sin phi alpha^2 <alpha| -alpha> + sin phi cos phi alpha^2 <-alpha| alpha> + sin^2 phi alpha^2 <-alpha| -alpha> ] / N^2

Which is the same as the expression for <a^2>, so <a† a> = [ alpha^2 (1) + alpha^2 sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

Wait, but that can't be. Wait, no, in the case of <a† a>, the operator is a† a, which gives the photon number. For a coherent state |alpha>, <a† a> = |alpha|^2. So, for the state |psi>, which is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, the expectation value of a† a would be [ |cos phi|^2 |alpha|^2 + |sin phi|^2 |alpha|^2 + cross terms ].

Wait, but in the calculation above, we have:

<psi| a† a |psi> = [ cos^2 phi alpha^2 + sin^2 phi alpha^2 + 2 cos phi sin phi alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

Which is alpha^2 [ cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi + 2 sin phi cos phi e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

But cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi = 1, so this becomes alpha^2 [1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

But N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}, as given in the problem statement. Therefore, <a† a> = alpha^2 [1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / [1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ] = alpha^2.

Wait, that's interesting. So, <a† a> = alpha^2. So, the average photon number is alpha squared. That's the same as a coherent state |alpha>. But in this case, the state is a superposition. Hmm. Let me check with phi = -pi/4. Then sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N^2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}. So, <a† a> = alpha^2 [1 + (-1) e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / [1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ].

Wait, but that would be alpha^2 [ (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}) ] / [1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ] = alpha^2. So, yes, regardless of phi, <a† a> = alpha^2. That's interesting. So, the average photon number is the same as a coherent state of amplitude alpha. But the state is a superposition. So, that's a key point.

Similarly, <a^2> = [ alpha^2 (1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ] / N^2. For phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) = -1, so <a^2> = [ alpha^2 (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ] / N^2. But N^2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}, so <a^2> = alpha^2. So, <a^2> = alpha^2. Similarly, <a†^2> = alpha^2.

Wait, so <a^2> = alpha^2, <a†^2> = alpha^2, and <a† a> = alpha^2.

But for a coherent state |alpha>, <a^2> = alpha^2, <a†^2> = alpha^2, and <a† a> = alpha^2. So, the second moments here are the same as those of a coherent state. But wait, but the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. However, due to the cross terms canceling out, the expectation values end up being the same as a coherent state. That's interesting.

But then, if the first moments are zero and the second moments are the same as a coherent state, then the covariance matrix would be the same as that of a coherent state, which is the vacuum covariance matrix, i.e., sigma = 0.5 I, since coherent states have minimum uncertainty. Wait, but coherent states have covariance matrix with variances 0.5 in both x and p. But if the first moments are zero, then the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments would be a thermal state? Wait, no. Wait, if the first moments are zero and the covariance matrix is the same as a coherent state, then the Gaussian state would be the vacuum state? But the average photon number here is alpha^2. Wait, but the vacuum state has average photon number zero. So, there's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. For a coherent state |alpha>, the average photon number is |alpha|^2. The covariance matrix is the same as the vacuum, with variances 0.5 in x and p. But in our case, the state |psi> has average photon number alpha^2, but the covariance matrix?

Wait, let's compute the variance of the quadratures. The variance of x is <x^2> - <x>^2. Since <x> = 0, it's just <x^2>. Similarly for p.

x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2), so x^2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2 a† a + 1)/2. Therefore, <x^2> = [ <a^2> + <a†^2> + 2 <a† a> + 1 ] / 2.

From our previous results, <a^2> = alpha^2, <a†^2> = alpha^2, <a† a> = alpha^2. Therefore,

<x^2> = [ alpha^2 + alpha^2 + 2 alpha^2 + 1 ] / 2 = [4 alpha^2 + 1]/2 = 2 alpha^2 + 0.5.

Similarly, the variance of x is 2 alpha^2 + 0.5. Similarly for p. Wait, but for a coherent state, the variance of x and p are 0.5 each. Here, the variance is larger. Therefore, the covariance matrix is different. Therefore, the reference Gaussian state tau is not a coherent state. It must be a thermal state or a squeezed state?

Wait, but the covariance matrix here is diagonal with variances (2 alpha^2 + 0.5) in both x and p. But for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix must satisfy the uncertainty principle. The covariance matrix here would be sigma = diag(2 alpha^2 + 0.5, 2 alpha^2 + 0.5)/2? Wait, no. Wait, the variance of x is <x^2> - <x>^2. Since <x> = 0, variance is <x^2>. But x is (a + a†)/sqrt(2), so x^2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2 a† a + 1)/2. Therefore, <x^2> = ( <a^2> + <a†^2> + 2 <a† a> + 1 ) / 2.

But we found that <a^2> = alpha^2, <a†^2> = alpha^2, <a† a> = alpha^2. Therefore,

<x^2> = (alpha^2 + alpha^2 + 2 alpha^2 + 1)/2 = (4 alpha^2 + 1)/2 = 2 alpha^2 + 0.5.

Similarly, the variance of x is 2 alpha^2 + 0.5, same for p. Therefore, the covariance matrix is:

sigma = [ (2 alpha^2 + 0.5)/2 0; 0 (2 alpha^2 + 0.5)/2 ].

Wait, no. The covariance matrix is defined as sigma_ij = (1/2) < {x_i, x_j } > - <x_i><x_j>. Since the first moments are zero, sigma_ij = (1/2) < {x_i, x_j } >. For x and p, the diagonal terms are (1/2) <x^2> and (1/2) <p^2>, and the off-diagonal terms are (1/2) <xp + px>.

But in our case, since the state is symmetric in x and p (since it's a superposition of coherent states along the real axis), the covariance matrix should be diagonal. Let me confirm.

Compute <xp + px>. xp + px = (a + a†)/sqrt(2) * (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)) + (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)) * (a + a†)/sqrt(2).

This simplifies to [ (a + a†)(a - a†) + (a - a†)(a + a†) ] / (2i).

Expanding:

First term: a^2 - a†^2 + a a† - a† a.

Second term: a^2 - a†^2 - a a† + a† a.

Adding them: 2 a^2 - 2 a†^2.

Therefore, <xp + px> = (2 <a^2> - 2 <a†^2> ) / (2i) = ( <a^2> - <a†^2> ) / i.

But since <a^2> = alpha^2 and <a†^2> = alpha^2 (since they are real), this becomes (alpha^2 - alpha^2)/i = 0. Therefore, the off-diagonal terms are zero. Therefore, the covariance matrix is diagonal with entries (1/2) <x^2> and (1/2) <p^2>. But since <x^2> = <p^2> (due to symmetry), the covariance matrix is sigma = diag( (2 alpha^2 + 0.5)/2, (2 alpha^2 + 0.5)/2 ). Wait, but (2 alpha^2 + 0.5)/2 = alpha^2 + 0.25. So, sigma = diag(alpha^2 + 0.25, alpha^2 + 0.25).

But for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix must satisfy the uncertainty relation det sigma >= (1/2)^2. Here, det sigma = (alpha^2 + 0.25)^2, which is greater than (0.5)^2 as long as alpha^2 + 0.25 >= 0.5, i.e., alpha^2 >= 0.25. For alpha = 0.5, alpha^2 = 0.25, so det sigma = (0.25 + 0.25)^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25. So, the uncertainty principle is saturated. Wait, but for a coherent state, the covariance matrix is diag(0.5, 0.5), which has det sigma = 0.25. So, in this case, with alpha = 0.5, the covariance matrix is diag(0.5, 0.5), same as a coherent state. Wait, but wait, if alpha = 0.5, then alpha^2 = 0.25, so sigma = diag(0.25 + 0.25, 0.25 + 0.25) = diag(0.5, 0.5). So, the covariance matrix is the same as a coherent state. But the average photon number is alpha^2 = 0.25. Wait, but a coherent state with alpha = 0.5 has average photon number 0.25 and covariance matrix diag(0.5, 0.5). So, in this case, the reference Gaussian state tau would be a coherent state with displacement zero and covariance matrix diag(0.5, 0.5). But wait, the average photon number of tau would be 0.25, same as rho. But wait, for a coherent state with displacement zero, it's the vacuum state, which has average photon number zero. Wait, this is a contradiction.

Wait, no. If the Gaussian state tau has displacement zero and covariance matrix diag(0.5, 0.5), then it's the vacuum state. But the average photon number of the vacuum is zero, but rho has average photon number 0.25. Therefore, there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, my previous conclusion that the covariance matrix is diag(0.5, 0.5) must be wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine the calculation. The average photon number <a† a> for rho is alpha^2, which is 0.25. For a Gaussian state with displacement zero and covariance matrix diag(s, s), the average photon number is (s - 0.5)/ (1 - 0.5) ??? Wait, no. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the average photon number is given by n = ( (sigma_x + sigma_p)/2 - 0.5 ). Wait, more accurately, the covariance matrix for a single mode is:

sigma = [[sigma_x, 0], [0, sigma_p]]

Then, the average photon number is (sigma_x + sigma_p - 1)/2. Because the photon number is <a† a> = ( <x^2> + <p^2> - 1 ) / 2. Since for the quadratures, <x^2> = sigma_x + <x>^2, but here <x> = 0, so <x^2> = sigma_x. Similarly for p. Therefore, <a† a> = (sigma_x + sigma_p - 1)/2.

In our case, sigma_x = sigma_p = (2 alpha^2 + 0.5)/2 = alpha^2 + 0.25. Therefore, <a† a> = (2*(alpha^2 + 0.25) - 1)/2 = (2 alpha^2 + 0.5 - 1)/2 = (2 alpha^2 - 0.5)/2 = alpha^2 - 0.25.

But we found earlier that <a† a> = alpha^2. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let's check again. The average photon number for the state rho is <a† a> = alpha^2. For the Gaussian state with covariance matrix sigma_x = sigma_p = alpha^2 + 0.25, the average photon number would be (sigma_x + sigma_p - 1)/2 = (2*(alpha^2 + 0.25) - 1)/2 = (2 alpha^2 + 0.5 - 1)/2 = (2 alpha^2 - 0.5)/2 = alpha^2 - 0.25. But this contradicts the fact that <a† a> for rho is alpha^2. Therefore, my calculation of the covariance matrix must be incorrect.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake in computing the second moments. Let's go back.

Earlier, I computed <a^2> as alpha^2. But let's verify this again. For phi = -pi/4, N^2 = 1 - e^{-0.5}. Then, <a^2> = [ alpha^2 (1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ] / N^2. Since sin(2 phi) = -1, this becomes [ alpha^2 (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ] / N^2. But N^2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}, so <a^2> = alpha^2. Similarly, <a† a> = alpha^2. But this leads to a contradiction in the photon number for the Gaussian state. Therefore, there must be an error in the calculation of <a† a>.

Wait, let's redo the calculation of <a† a> carefully. The operator a† a is the number operator. For the state |psi> = (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N, the expectation value <a† a> is:

<psi| a† a |psi> = [ cos^2 phi <alpha|a† a|alpha> + sin^2 phi <-alpha|a† a|-alpha> + cos phi sin phi ( <alpha|a† a|-alpha> + <-alpha|a† a|alpha> ) ] / N^2.

Now, <alpha|a† a|alpha> = |alpha|^2. Similarly, <-alpha|a† a|-alpha> = |alpha|^2. The cross terms are <alpha|a† a|-alpha> and <-alpha|a† a|alpha>.

Compute <alpha|a† a|-alpha> = <alpha| a† a |-alpha> = <alpha| (-alpha) a† |-alpha> = (-alpha) <alpha| a† |-alpha> = (-alpha) < -alpha | a | alpha >*.

But < -alpha | a | alpha > = alpha < -alpha | alpha > = alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Therefore, <alpha|a† a|-alpha> = (-alpha) (alpha e^{-2 alpha^2})^* = - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} (since alpha is real).

Similarly, <-alpha|a† a|alpha> = < -alpha | a† a | alpha > = < -alpha | alpha a† | alpha > = alpha < -alpha | a† | alpha > = alpha < alpha | a | -alpha >^* = alpha ( - alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} )^* = - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Therefore, the cross terms are cos phi sin phi ( - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ) = - 2 alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} cos phi sin phi.

Therefore, putting it all together:

< a† a > = [ cos^2 phi alpha^2 + sin^2 phi alpha^2 - 2 alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} cos phi sin phi ] / N^2.

Factor out alpha^2:

= alpha^2 [ cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi - 2 e^{-2 alpha^2} cos phi sin phi ] / N^2.

Since cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi = 1, this becomes:

= alpha^2 [ 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} sin(2 phi) ] / N^2.

But N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}, so substituting:

< a† a > = alpha^2 [ 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} sin(2 phi) ] / [1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ].

Ah! So, this is different from my previous conclusion. Earlier, I thought it was alpha^2, but that was incorrect. The correct expression is as above. Therefore, for phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) = -1, so:

< a† a > = alpha^2 [ 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} (-1) ] / [1 + (-1) e^{-2 alpha^2} ] = alpha^2 [1 + e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / [1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ].

For alpha = 0.5, e^{-2 alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065. Therefore:

< a† a > ≈ (0.25) [1 + 0.6065] / [1 - 0.6065] ≈ 0.25 * 1.6065 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.25 * 4.08 ≈ 1.02.

Wait, that's approximately 1.02. But this contradicts the earlier statement that <a† a> = alpha^2. So, my previous conclusion was wrong. Therefore, the average photon number is not alpha^2, but rather alpha^2 [1 + e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / [1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ].

Therefore, the covariance matrix calculations must be revisited.

Similarly, let's recompute <a^2>:

Earlier, we had <a^2> = [ alpha^2 (1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ] / N^2.

For phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) = -1, so:

< a^2 > = [ alpha^2 (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ] / N^2.

But N^2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}, so <a^2> = alpha^2 (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ) / (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ) = alpha^2. So, <a^2> = alpha^2. Similarly, <a†^2> = alpha^2.

But then, the variance of x is <x^2> = ( <a^2> + <a†^2> + 2 <a† a> + 1 ) / 2.

Plugging in <a^2> = alpha^2, <a†^2> = alpha^2, <a† a> = alpha^2 [1 + e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / [1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ].

Therefore,

<x^2> = ( alpha^2 + alpha^2 + 2 * [ alpha^2 (1 + e^{-2 alpha^2} ) / (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ] + 1 ) / 2.

Simplify:

= ( 2 alpha^2 + 1 + 2 alpha^2 (1 + e^{-2 alpha^2} ) / (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ) / 2.

Factor out 2 alpha^2:

= [ 1 + 2 alpha^2 ( 1 + (1 + e^{-2 alpha^2} ) / (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ) ] / 2.

Wait, maybe better to compute numerically for alpha = 0.5.

Given alpha = 0.5, e^{-2 alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065.

So, <a† a> ≈ 0.25 * (1 + 0.6065) / (1 - 0.6065) ≈ 0.25 * 1.6065 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.25 * 4.08 ≈ 1.02.

Then, <x^2> = (0.25 + 0.25 + 2*1.02 + 1)/2 = (0.5 + 2.04 + 1)/2 = (3.54)/2 = 1.77.

Similarly, the variance of x is 1.77. The covariance matrix entry for x is (1/2) <x^2> = 0.885. Similarly for p. Therefore, the covariance matrix is diag(0.885, 0.885). But for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix must satisfy det sigma >= 0.25. Here, det sigma = 0.885^2 ≈ 0.783, which is greater than 0.25, so it's okay.

But then, the reference Gaussian state tau is a thermal state with covariance matrix diag(0.885, 0.885) and displacement zero. The entropy S(tau) of a Gaussian state can be computed using the formula for the entropy of a thermal state. For a single-mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix sigma, the entropy is given by:

S = (nu + 1)/2 * ln( (nu + 1)/2 ) - (nu - 1)/2 * ln( (nu - 1)/2 ),

where nu is the symplectic eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. For a covariance matrix diag(s, s), the symplectic eigenvalue is nu = 2 sqrt(det sigma) = 2 s, since det sigma = s^2. Wait, no. For a covariance matrix sigma = diag(s, s), the symplectic eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of the matrix sigma^{1/2} Omega sigma^{1/2} where Omega is the symplectic form. But for a diagonal covariance matrix with equal entries, the symplectic eigenvalue is just s. Wait, maybe I need to recall the correct formula.

The entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix sigma is given by:

S = ( (nu + 1)/2 ) ln( (nu + 1)/2 ) - ( (nu - 1)/2 ) ln( (nu - 1)/2 ),

where nu is the symplectic eigenvalue, which for a covariance matrix diag(s, s) is nu = 2 sqrt(det sigma). Wait, no. For a single-mode Gaussian state, the symplectic eigenvalue is given by nu = sqrt(det sigma). Wait, let me check.

The covariance matrix sigma must satisfy the uncertainty principle sigma + i Omega/2 >= 0, where Omega is the symplectic form [[0,1],[-1,0]]. The symplectic eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of the matrix 2 sigma \Omega^{-1}. For a covariance matrix diag(s, s), this matrix is 2 sigma \Omega^{-1} = 2 diag(s, s) * [[0, -1], [1, 0]] = 2 [ [0, -s], [s, 0] ]. The eigenvalues of this matrix are +/- 2 s i, so the symplectic eigenvalues are 2 s. Therefore, nu = 2 s.

But the entropy formula uses the symplectic eigenvalues. Wait, no. Wait, the entropy formula for a Gaussian state is S = sum_{k} [ (nu_k + 1)/2 ln( (

To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we start with the given state:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)| -\alpha\rangle}{N}
\]

where \(\phi = -\pi/4\), \(\alpha = 0.5\), and the normalization constant \(N\) is:

\[
N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}
\]

Substituting the given values, we find \(N \approx 0.627\).

The relative entropy measure of non-Gaussianity is defined as:

\[
\delta_b = \text{tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{tr}(\tau \ln \tau)
\]

where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the cat state (a pure state) and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as \(\rho\).

For the pure state \(\rho\), the von Neumann entropy \(\text{tr}(\rho \ln \rho)\) is zero. Therefore, \(\delta_b\) simplifies to the negative of the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\):

\[
\delta_b = -\text{tr}(\tau \ln \tau)
\]

To find \(\tau\), we compute the covariance matrix (CM) of the cat state. The first moments (displacement) are zero. The second moments are calculated as follows:

- \(\langle a \rangle = 0\)
- \(\langle a^2 \rangle = \alpha^2 = 0.25\)
- \(\langle a^\dagger a \rangle = 0.25\)

Using these, the quadrature variances are:
- \(\langle x^2 \rangle = 1\)
- \(\langle p^2 \rangle = 0.5\)

The covariance matrix of \(\tau\) is:

\[
\text{CM} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The symplectic eigenvalue \(\nu\) of this CM is \(\sqrt{0.5} \approx 0.7071\). The von Neumann entropy \(S(\tau)\) is calculated using the formula:

\[
S = (\nu + \frac{1}{2}) \ln(\nu + \frac{1}{2}) - (\nu - \frac{1}{2}) \ln(\nu - \frac{1}{2})
\]

Substituting \(\nu = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\):

\[
S \approx 0.555 \text{ nats}
\]

Thus, the non-Gaussianity \(\delta_b\) is:

\[
\boxed{0.555}
\]

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this by considering the covariance matrix directly.

Wait, for the Gaussian state, the entropy depends only on the covariance matrix and the first moments. However, if the first moments are non-zero, the entropy calculation involves the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Let's recall that the von Neumann entropy of a Gaussian state is given by S = sum_{k} [(ν_k + 1/2) ln((ν_k + 1/2)) - (ν_k - 1/2) ln((ν_k - 1/2))}, where ν_k are the symplectic eigenvalues.

But first, let's compute the first moments (the displacement) and the covariance matrix for the state rho. For coherent states, the covariance matrices are the same as the vacuum state (since they are just displaced vacuum states), but when we have a superposition, it's more complicated.

Wait, in the problem, the reference Gaussian state tau is defined as having the same first and second moments as rho. So the first thing to do is to compute the expectation values of position x and momentum p (or equivalently the quadrature operators) and their second moments for the cat state. Then, tau would be the Gaussian state with those moments.

Alternatively, maybe in the single-mode case, with displacement d and covariance matrix CM.

Alternatively, in terms of the annihilation and creation operators. Let me recall that for a single mode Gaussian state, the density matrix can be characterized by a displacement vector and covariance matrix. The displacement vector is just [<x>, <p>], and the covariance matrix includes the variances and covariance between x and p.

Given a state rho, to find the reference Gaussian state tau, we have to compute the displacement vector and covariance matrix from rho, which will define tau. Then, once we have tau, we can compute its entropy.

So, breaking down the steps required:

1. Compute the expectation value of x and p (the first moments).
2. Compute the second moments: <x^2>, <p^2>, <xp + px>.
3. Compute the covariance matrix from these.
4. Determine the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix for the Gaussian state tau.
5. Compute the entropy of tau using the symplectic eigenvalues.
6. Since rho being pure, its entropy is zero, so del_b = -S(tau).

But wait, in problem states that reference state tau is a Gaussian state with same density matrix or same moments? Wait, actually, tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho.

Therefore, to compute tau, it's necessary to get the covariance matrix and displacement of rho, build tau accordingly, then compute the entropy of tau.

Given that the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states: |alpha> and |-alpha>, which for real alpha, are in the position representation even and odd coherent states depending on the coefficients. Wait, but phi is given as -pi/4. Let me compute N first for the parameters given.

Given alpha = 0.5 and phi = -pi/4. Let me compute the normalization N.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2})

Phi = -pi/4, so 2phi = -pi/2, sin(-pi/2) = -1, and alpha = 0.5, so e^{-2*(0.5)^2} = e^{-0.5} = 1/sqrt(e) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - e^{-0.5}) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.6065) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

Therefore, N ≈ 0.627 approximately. Maybe more accurate in exact terms, but maybe we can keep things symbolic for some steps.

Alternatively, since we need to compute expectation values, perhaps these have analytical forms.

First, let's handle the state |psi> normalized by N. Let's note that unlike the even and odd coherent states which have phi = pi/4, here phi = -pi/4. Let's compute cos(phi) and sin(phi). Cos(-pi/4) = cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. Therefore, cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2.

Therefore, |psi> = [ (sqrt(2)/2) |alpha> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N. So, simplifying, [|alpha> - |-alpha>] / (sqrt(2)*N). Wait, [sqrt(2)/2 (|alpha> - |-alpha>)] / N. Therefore, normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*e^{-2 alpha^2}) as given. Since 2phi = -pi/2, sin(2phi) = -1, so N = sqrt(1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}). For alpha=0.5, e^{-2*(0.5)^2} = e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065, so N=sqrt(1 - 0.6065)≈sqrt(0.3935)≈0.627.

Wait, actually, for |psi> as defined, the inner product <alpha | -alpha> is e^{-2 |alpha|^2} when alpha is real. So the normalization is N^2 = 1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}. Since in our case phi = -pi/4, 2phi = -pi/2, sin(-pi/2) = -1, therefore N^2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} which for alpha=0.5 gives N^2 = 1 - e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.3935, hence N ≈ 0.627.

Therefore, the state |psi> is [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N with phi = -pi/4, alpha = 0.5.

To compute the moments, like <a>, we can compute <psi|a|psi>\.

First, compute <a>:

<a> = [cos^2(phi) <alpha|a|alpha> + sin^2(phi) <-alpha|a|-alpha> + cos(phi)sin(phi) <alpha|a|-alpha> + sin(phi)cos(phi) <-alpha|a|alpha>]/N^2

Given that:

<alpha|a|alpha> = alpha = 0.5,

<-alpha|a|-alpha> = -alpha = -0.5,

<alpha|a|-alpha> = <alpha| \-alpha| \alpha> ?

Wait, no: <alpha | a |-alpha> is... wait, coherent states are eigenstates of a, so a|alpha> = alpha |alpha>. Therefore <alpha| a |-alpha> = <alpha| (a |-alpha>) = <alpha| (-alpha |-alpha>) = -alpha <alpha | -alpha> = -alpha e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

Similarly, <-alpha|a|alpha> = <alpha | a | -alpha>^* might be.

Wait, more precisely:

Since a|beta> = beta |beta> for any coherent state |beta>, so <gamma| a |beta> = <gamma| (beta |beta>) = beta <gamma | beta>.

Therefore <gamma|a|beta> = beta <gamma | beta>.

Therefore, in our case:

<alpha|a|alpha> = alpha <alpha|alpha> = alpha,

<-alpha|a|-alpha> = -alpha <-alpha | -alpha> = -alpha,

<alpha | a |-alpha> = (-alpha) <alpha | -alpha> = -alpha e^{-2 |alpha|^2},

similarly, <-alpha |a| alpha> = alpha <-alpha | alpha> = alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} because <-alpha|α> is e^{- |alpha|^2 - | -alpha|^2 + (-alpha)(alpha^*)} which is, for real alpha = 0.5, it would be e^{-0.25 -0.25 -(0.5^2)} = wait perhaps, this is incorrectly thought. See, the overlap between |alpha> and |beta> is <alpha | beta> = e^{-|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha^* beta}, so for real alpha and beta being real and -alpha,

<alpha | -alpha> = e^{-|alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2/2+ alpha*(-alpha)}. Wait, no, actually, the general formula is <alpha | beta> = exp( - (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + alpha^* beta ). So if both alpha and beta are real (so beta = -alpha), then <alpha | -alpha> = e^{ - (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + alpha*(-alpha) } = e^{-alpha^2 - alpha^2} = e^{-2 alpha^2}. Yes, so indeed <alpha | -alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}. So if alpha is real, so that's correct.

Therefore, <alpha | -alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2}. Therefore <-alpha | alpha> is also equal to e^{-2 alpha^2} since it's the complex conjugate.

Therefore, the terms:

In the expansion of <a>,

- The first term: cos^2(phi) * alpha

- The second term: sin^2(phi)*(-alpha)

- The cross terms: cos(phi)sin(phi) [ -alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} ] + sin(phi)cos(phi) [ alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} ]

But notice that cos(phi)sin(phi) and sin(phi)cos(phi) are the same (since scalar multiplication commutes).

Therefore, cross terms: 2 * [ sin(phi)cos(phi) * e^{-2 alpha^2} * ( - alpha + alpha )? Wait, no:

Wait, first cross term: cos(phi)sin(phi) * <alpha|a|-alpha> = c s * (-alpha e^{-2 alpha^2})

Second cross term: sin(phi)cos(phi) * <-alpha|a|alpha> = s c * ( alpha e^{-2 alpha^2 })

Therefore total cross terms = c s*(-alpha e^{-2a^2}) + s c*(alpha e^{-2a^2}) } = α e^{-2a^2} c s ( -1 +1 ) = 0.

Therefore, cross terms cancel each other.

Therefore, <a> = [cos^2(phi) * alpha + sin^2(phi)*(-alpha)] / N^2

For phi = -pi/4, cos^2(phi) = cos^2(pi/4) = (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5, same as sin^2(phi) = 0.5. But wait, with phi = -pi/4, cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2, so cos^2(phi) = (sqrt(2)/2)^2=0.5, sin^2(phi)= same.

Therefore,

<a> = [0.5 * alpha + 0.5 * (-alpha) ] / N^2. The terms cancel each other, hence <a> = 0. Therefore, the first moment displacement is zero.

That's significant. So displacement is zero. So the first moment of the annihilation operator a is zero, so the displacement in phase space is zero.

Therefore, the mean vector (displacement) of both rho and its Gaussian reference tau is zero.

Therefore, the only contribution for the covariance matrix would come from the second moments.

So next step is to compute the second moments.

Second moments include:

- <a^2>, the expectation value of a squared.

- <a^{dagger 2}>, the expectation value of (a†)^2.

- <a† a>, the expectation value of the number operator.

But for a single-mode Gaussian state, it's also represented via the covariance matrix, which can be given in terms of the quadrature variables x and p.

Alternatively, in terms of the operators x= (a + a†)/√2, p = (a - a†)/(i√2). Then the covariance matrix elements can be given as variances and covariance.

But we need to calculate <x^2>, <p^2>, and <xp + px>.

Alternatively, since the displacement is zero, the covariance matrix CM is given by:

CM = [ [ <x^2> - <x>^2, <(x p + p x)/2> - <x><p> ], [ <(x p + p x)/2 - <x><p>, <p^2> - <p>^2 ] ]

But since <x> and <p> are zero (from <a> = 0), this simplifies to:

CM = [ [ <x^2>, <(x p + p x)/2>], [ <(x p + p x)/2>, <p^2> ] ]

But in terms of quadrature variances, it might be customary to write the covariance matrix with σ_x^2, σ_p^2, and the covariance. Then, the covariance matrix is [[σ_x^2, σ_xp], [σ_xp, σ_p^2]].

So we need to compute σ_x^2 = <x^2>, which is derived from x= (a + a†)/√2, so x^2 = (a + a†)^2/2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2 a† a + 1)/2. Therefore <x^2> = ( <a^2> + <a†^2> + 2 <a† a> + 1 ) / 2.

Similarly, <p^2> is similar but with a negative sign for the cross terms. Let's compute p = (a - a†)/(i√2), so p^2 = -(a - a†)^2 /2 = (-a^2 -a†^2 + 2a†a +1 ) / 2. Therefore <p^2> = ( - <a^2> - <a†^2> + 2 <a† a> +1 ) / 2.

The cross term <(x p + p x)/2> can be calculated as well. However, if the state has rotational symmetry, covariance σ_xp might be zero. But since our state is a superposition of two coherent states along the real axis (since alpha is real), the state is symmetric in x direction? Wait, when you have |alpha> and |-alpha> with real alpha, they are along the real axis in phase space. Therefore, their superposition might have different symmetry. Since our state is a linear combination of |0.5> and |-0.5>, which are real coherent states.

Actually, for such a state, the expectation values such as <a^2> and <a†^2> are real? Let's check.

First, calculate <a^2>.

Calculate <a^2> with respect to the state rho.

Again, expanding <a^2> for rho, which is |psi><psi|

So, <a^2> = <psi| a^2 |psi> =

[ cos^2(phi) <alpha |a^2| alpha> + sin^2(phi) <-alpha |a^2| -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha |a^2| -alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) <-alpha |a^2| alpha> ] / N^2

Similarly:

<alpha |a^2| alpha> = α^2

<-alpha |a^2| -alpha> = (-α)^2 = α^2

<alpha |a^2| -alpha> = <alpha|a^2 |-alpha> = <alpha| a * a | -alpha>

But a | -alpha> = -alpha | -alpha>

So, <alpha | a^2 | -alpha> = (-alpha)^2 <alpha | -alpha> = alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2}

Similarly, <-alpha | a^2 | alpha> = (alpha)^2 e^{-2 alpha^2}

Therefore,

Processing:

cos^2(phi)*alpha^2 + sin^2(phi)*alpha^2 + sin(phi) cos(phi) [alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} + alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] ] / N^2

Thus,

<alpha |a^2| psi> becomes:

= [alpha^2 (cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi)) + 2 sin(phi) cos(phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2

Given cos^2 + sin^2 =1,

< a^2 > = [ alpha^2 + 2 sin(phi) cos(phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2

Similarly, compute <a^2> + <a†^2>?

Wait, no. For x^2 and p^2, we'd need a^2, a†^2, and a†a +...

Wait, but maybe better to first compute <a^2> and <a†^2>.

But for a complex interpretation, note that, because the state psi is real in position? Because when we have superpositions of |alpha> and |-alpha> on the real axis, their wavefunctions in position are symmetric/antisymmetric. But then, probably, the expectation values <a^2> may be real. Similarly, <a†^2> would be the complex conjugate of <a^2>.

Given that, for real alpha, <a^2> for |psi> maybe real as well.

First, proceeding. Let me compute <a^2>.

With phi = -pi/4,

sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2, cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2.

Therefore, sin(phi)cos(phi) = ( sqrt(2)/2 ) * (-sqrt(2)/2 ) = - (2 /4 ) = -0.5

Hence,

< a^2 > = [ alpha^2 + 2*(-0.5)*alpha^2*e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2

Again, alpha = 0.5,

Therefore,

First, alpha^2 = (0.5)^2=0.25,

e^{-2 alpha^2} = e^{-2*(0.25)} = e^{-0.5}≈0.6065.

Thus,

< a^2 > = [0.25 + 2*(-0.5)*0.25*0.6065]/N^2

Calculate 2*(-0.5) = -1

So,

= [0.25 - 0.25*0.6065 ] / N^(2)

= 0.25*(1 - 0.6065)/N^2

But 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935, so

=0.25*0.3935 /0.3935 ≈ 0.25/(N^2) ) Wait, because N^2 =1 - e^{-0.5}=0.3935

Therefore, 0.25*(0.3935)/0.3935 = 0.25.

Thus, <a^2 >=0.25.

Wait, but that can't be. Let's check:

Wait, the expression is:

< a^2> = [ alpha^2 + 2 sin(phi) cos(phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2

Substituting sin(2phi) would have been 2 sin(phi) cos(phi). Actually, 2n(phi)= -pi/4, so sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1, so indeed 2 sin phi cos phi = -1.

Wait, alpha squared is 0.25, so:

0.25 + (-1)*0.25*e^{-0.5} all divided by 0.3935.

So, numerator: 0.25 - 0.25 *0.6065 ≈ 0.25 - 0.1516 ≈ 0.0984,

Then,

< a^2 >≈ 0.0984 / 0.3935 ≈ approx 0.25

Wait, 0.0984 / 0.3935 = approximately 0.25. Wait 0.3935 *0.25 =0.098375, yes exactly. Hence:

[ alpha^2 + 2 sin phi cos phi alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2 } ] = (0.25) * [1 - e^{-0.5}]

Thus, divided by N^2=1 - e^{-0.5}, cancels out. Therefore < a^2 > equals (0.25 (1 -e^{-0.5} )) / (1 - e^{-0.5}) ) = 0.25.

So yes, neatly the expectation value of a^2 is just alpha squared.

Wait, really? That's clever. Because (1 - e^{-0.5}) cancels out. So <a^2> = alpha^2 regardless.

Wait, but actually, alpha=0.5. So maybe 0.25 regardless. Interesting. Let me substitute these values again.

But more abstractly: Suppose we write

< a^2 > = [ alpha^2 (1 + 2 sin phi cos phi e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ] / [1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ]

But given that here sin(2 phi)= sin(-pi/2)=-1, and 2 sin phi cos phi= sin(2 phi)= -1.

Therefore,

= [ alpha^2(1 + (-1) e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ] / (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} )

Simplify numerator: alpha^2*(1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ) divided by 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2 }, which cancels. So yes,

< a^2 > = alpha^2. Therefore, regardless of phi (given phi=-pi/4), considering alpha=0.5, < a^2 >=(0.5)^2=0.25.

Similarly, <a^†2> = complex conjugate of <a^2>, but since <a^2> is real, so <a†^2> = <a^2>^*=0.25.

Similarly, compute <a†a> to get the photon number.

Calculating <n> = <a†a> for the state |psi>:

Similarly, <a†a> = [ cos^2(phi) <alpha|a†a|alpha> + sin^2(phi)<-alpha|a†a|-alpha> + ... cross terms ] / N^2

Now, <alpha|a†a|alpha> = |alpha|^2, which is 0.25.

Similarly, <-alpha|a†a|-alpha> = | -alpha |^2=0.25.

Cross terms:

cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|a†a|-alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) <-alpha|a†a|alpha>

Firstly, <alpha|a†a|-alpha> = <alpha|a†a| - alpha> = <alpha | a†*(-alpha) | -alpha >.

But (a†a)|-alpha> = (-alpha)a†| - alpha> = (-alpha)(-alpha^* ) |- alpha >, but I need to compute it in a different way. Maybe:

Wait <alpha|a†a| - alpha> = Tr(a†a | - alpha><alpha | )

But perhaps step by step:

A coherent state |beta> is eigenstate of a: a |beta> = beta |beta>.

Thus, a†a |beta> = |beta|^2 |beta>,

Therefore, <alpha |a†a| -alpha> is <alpha| (-alpha)^2 | -alpha> } = (-alpha)^2 <alpha | -alpha> } = alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2}

But since alpha is real here, this is 0.25 e^{-0.5} for alpha=0.5.

Similarly, the other cross term is the same: <-alpha|a†a| alpha> = < -alpha | alpha^2| alpha > }= alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2}

Thus, the cross terms are cos(phi) sin(phi) *0.25 e^{-0.5} + sin(phi) cos(phi) *0.25 e^{-0.5}

Again, sin(phi) cos(phi) being the same as cos(phi) sin(phi), and phi= -pi/4 gives sin(phi) cos(phi)= -1/2 as 2* sin ϕ cos ϕ= sin(2ϕ)=sin(-pi/2)= -1.

Therefore, 2 terms summing gives 2*(-1/2)*0.25 e^{-0.5} /N^2 ?

Wait:

Wait more carefully:

So:

< a†a > =[ cos^2(phi)*0.25 + sin^2(phi)*0.25 + sin(phi)cos(phi) * 2*(0.25) e^{-0.5} ] / (N^2)

Because both cross terms are sin(phi)cos(phi)*0.25 e^{-0.5} each.

So sum is 2 * term for cross.

Therefore,

< a†a > = 0.25 ( cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) ) / N^2 + 0.25 e^{-0.5} * 2 sin(phi)cos(phi) /N^2

Similarly, cos^2 + sin^2=1,

So ==> (0.25 / 0.3935) + (0.25 e^{-0.5} * 2 sin(phi)cos(phi) ) / 0.3935.

Given sin(phi)cos(phi)= -0.5,

So <a†a> = 0.25 / N^2 + (0.25 e^{-0.5}*(-1))/N^2

With numbers:

E^{-0.5}≈0.6065; =-0.25*0.6065

So,

0.25/0.3935 ≈0.635,

Minus 0.25*0.6065 /0.3935≈ (0.1516)/0.3935≈0.385.

Thus,

< a†a >≈ 0.635 -0.385≈ 0.25.

Wait that also maybe cages out. Going back to the general formula,

<a†a> = [0.25 (1) + sin(phi)cos(phi)*2*0.25* e^{-2 alpha^2 }]/N^2}

= [0.25 + (sin(2phi) *0.25 e^{-2 alpha^2 )} ]/N^2

Since 2 sin phi cos phi = sin(2 phi).

We have phi= -pi/4, so sin(2 phi)= sin(-pi/2)= -1

Then,

Thus,

< a†a > = [0.25 + (-1)*0.25* e^{-0.5} ] / (1 - e^{-0.5})

= [0.25(1 - e^{-0.5}) ]/(1 - e^{-0.5})

=0.25. Once again, both numerator and denominator cancel their terms, so it's simply 0.25.

Therefore, a†a>

Similarly, the expectation value of the photon number is 0.25. Which makes sense if alpha=0.5, then each coherent state has |alpha|^2=0.25, and considering the state is a balanced superposition (proportional to |alpha> - | -alpha >), maybe having an average of 0.25 number. Therefore, their averages are determined.

Now, moving on to compute the x and p quadratures.

We have for x = (a +a†)/sqrt(2) and p=(a -a†)/i sqrt(2).

Calculating <x^2>:

From the relationship:

x^2 = (a +a†)^2 /2 = (a^2 + a†^2 + 2 a†a +1)/2

Thus, <x^2> = ( <a^2> + <a†^2> + 2 <a†a> +1 )/2

We have <a^2>=0.25, <a†^2>=0.25, and <a†a>=0.25

Thus,

<x^2>= (0.25 +0.25 + 2*(0.25) +1)/2=(0.5 +0.5 +1)/2 =2/2=1.

Similarly, for <p^2>:

Using p^2 = - (a - a†)^2 / 2 - 1/2. Wait, let's compute accurately:

p = (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)), therefore

p^2 = -(a -a†)^2 /2 = - (a^2 + a†^2 - 2a†a -1 )/2

(Here, (a -a†)^2 =a^2 - a a† -a† a + a†^2= a^2 +a†^2 - 2 a† a -1, this because a a†=a†a +1 )

Thus,

p^2 = -(a^2 +a†^2 -2a†a -1 )/2

Therefore,

< p^2 > = [ - <a^2> - <a†^2> + 2 <a†a> +1 ]/2

Substituting numbers:

= [ -0.25 -0.25 +2*0.25 +1 ] /2

= [ -0.5 +0.5 +1 ] /2 =1/2=0.5.

Wait, this gives <p^2>=0.5?

However, then the variance of x, <x^2> =1 and <p^2>=0.5. But the vacuum state has <x^2>=0.5, so this state has <x^2> of 1 and <p^2> of 0.5. But then is this compatible with a Gaussian state?

Wait, perhaps more precisely, now module focus on.

But for our purposes, the Gaussian state tau would be the one with displacement zero, and covariance matrix with <x^2>and <p^2> just computed from the cat state rho. Alternatively, because for a Gaussian state, the variances of x and p must satisfy simplex such that the uncertainty principle: covariance matrix must be such that det(CM) >= something.

But for the caclulation, we need to compute the Covariance matrix entries. But maybe here the CM is diagonal?, since if the state has been computed as <x^2>=1, <p^2>=0.5, then it may not be a minimum uncertainty state?

But wait, for any state, the covariance matrix should satisfy Symplectic condition, the uncertainty relations. For a single mode, Uncertainty principle says that the Symplectic matrix requires the covariance matrix satisfy:

CM + i Omega/2 >=0, where Omega is the symplectic form. Which implies that the product of variances for X and P satisfy V_xV_p >=1/4, similarly.

In this case, if V_x =1 and V_p=0.5, their product is 0.5, which is equal to 1/2, greater than 1/4. So the uncertainty relation is satisfied.

So the reference Gaussian state tau has displacement zero and covariance matrix [[1,0],[0,0.5]]. Such a covariance matrix.

But the entropy of a Gaussian state with CM\end{pmatrix}= [[v_x, 0],[0, v_p]] (diagonal) is given by:

S = (n + 1/2 ) ln( n + 1/2 ) - (n - 1/2 ) ln( n - 1/2 )

where n is the thermal photon number. But more directly, the von Neumann entropy in terms of the symplectic eigenvalue. For a single mode Gaussian state, the CM can be expressed in terms of the symplectic eigenvalue \nu= sqrt{v_x v_p} in the case of the CM being in normal form (i.e., diagonal). Hmm, actually no. For a general single-modestate, the symplectic eigenvalues are given by solving the eigenvalues of (CM / Omega^{-1}) ?

Actually, the formula for von Neumann entropy is S = \sum ( (\nu_k +.5 ) ln(\nu_k+.5) - (\nu_k - 0.5 ) ln( \nu_k -0.5 ) )

In the case of a single-mode Gaussian state, you have one symplectic eigenvalueν= sqrt( (det(CM))^(1/2))? Or not.

Let me recall the procedure for a single mode Gaussian state.

The CM can be written as a 2x2 matrix

CM = [ [ σ_xx, σ_xp ], [ σ_xp, σ_pp ] ]

The symplectic eigenvalues are given by ν = sqrt(det CM}^(1/2)

Wait, symplectic eigenvalues are typically sqrt{parametric}(:For a single mode, if the CM is written as [[a, c],[c, b]], then the symplectic eigenvalue is sqrt{(a b - c^2)}.

But no wait, actually, for a single mode, the symplectic eigenvalue is ν= sqrt[ ( (a b - c²) ) ].

But the uncertainty principle requires that ν >= 1/2.

In our case, the CM is diagonal with σ_xx=1 and σ_pp=0.5, and σ_xp=0,determinate.

Therefore, the determinant is σ_xx*σ_pp - 0= 1*0.5=0.5, so the symplectic eigenvalue is ν= sqrt(0.5 )≈0.7071.

However, the von Neumann entropy is computed as:

S = (ν + 0.5 ) ln(ν +0.5 ) - (ν -0.5 ) ln(ν -0.5 )

But here, nu= sqrt(0.5 )≈0.707，ν is greater than 0.5? Let's compute.

nu= sqrt(0.5 )≈0.707， ν-0.5≈0.207， which is >0。Alright.

So plugging into the entropy:

S = (0.707 +0.5 ) * ln(1.207 ) - (0.707 -0.5 ) * ln(0.207 )

Calculate lhaskl terms:

First term:Approximately 1.207 * ln(1.207 ). Let's compute each part.

Note that at this stage, one might consider using exact expressions.

Wait determinant CM=0.5, So the symplectic eigenvalue nu= sqrt(det CM )=sqrt(0.5 )

Thus nu=1/sqrt(2) ≈0.707.

Thus,

Entropy S = (1/sqrt(2) + 1/2 ) ln(1/sqrt(2) + 1/2 ) - (1/sqrt(2) -1/2 ) ln(1/sqrt(2) -1/2 )

This computation can't be simplified much analytically, and requires evaluating these terms numerically.

Let's compute S:

For clarity, let me use exact terms.

1/sqrt(2) is approximately (~)0.7071.

1/sqrt(2) +1/2 ~ 0.7071 +0.5 =1.2071

1/sqrt(2) -1/2 ~0.7071 -0.5 =0.2071

So,

S =1.2071 *ln(1.2071 ) -0.2071 ln(0.2071 )

Computing individually:

ln(1.2071)≈0.19 (since ln(1.2)≈0.1823, ln(1.210≈ 0.1906)

ln(0.2071)≈-1.575

Therefore,

S ≈1.2071 *0.1906 -0.2071*(-1.575 )

≈0.2297 +0.3266≈0.5563

Therefore, S≈0.5563.

But let me compute more precisely with a calculator.

For greater precision:

1/sqrt(2) ≈0.70710678118

nu = 0.70710678118

Compute:

1) Term1 = (nu +0.5 ) * ln( nu +0.5 )

nu +0.5≈≈0.70710678118 +0.5=1.20710678118

ln(1.20710678118 )≈ let's use calculator:

ln(1.2071)= Using taylor expansion or recall that ln(1.2)=0.1823215, ln(1.21)=0.19062036.

Since 1.2071 is approximately between 1.2 and 1.21: About 1.2071

Technice鋼 mount:

ln(1.2071)≈0.1899625 ?

Inserting into calculator (even approximate), e.g. for higher precision,

let me use natural logs to calc:

e^0.19= approx 1.209. Therefore, ln(1.209)=0.19

Alternatively, Hoster terms say, precise ln(1.20710678118)= approximately 0.189929... So Term1≈1.2071 *0.189929≈≈0.229.

Term 2= - (nu -0.5 ) * ln(nu -0.5 )

nu -0.5 ≈0.70710678118 -0.5≈0.20710678118

ln(0.20710678118 )≈again,

Well, ln(0.2)=−1.6094, ln(0.2071)=Approx better:

Since e^-1.57～.208.

Wait, e^-1.57≈, let's see:

e^{-1.5}=0.2231,

e^{-1.6}=0.2019, so linearly from 0.2019 to0.2231 between-1.6 to -1.5.

We have ln(0.2071)=. Well, e^{-1.57}=024, no, exact:

Let me suppose that works. If 0.2071, e^{-1.57}=0.207...
so ln(0.2071)=≈-1.575

Indeed, let’s take as ln(0.2071)≈-1.575

Therefore, once:

Term2= -0.20710678118 * (-1.575 )≈0.32654...

Therefore, total entropy S≈0.229 +0.3265≈0.5555.

So S≈0.5555．natural logs.

So substituting back, non-Gaussianity del_b= [tr(σ ln σ) - τ ln τ]． Given that rho is pure, tr(rho ln rho)=0． Therefore, del_b=0 - S(tau)≈-0.5555．But relative entropy should be non-negative. Since relative entropy is always non-negative, but here we are being told that del_b is [tr(rho ln rho - tau ln tau)].

Typically, the relative entropy is S(rho||tau)=tr(rho ln rho) - tr(rho ln tau)). But in this problem, the the measure is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)].

Hence, the definition given might not be the standard relative entropy, but actually, if someone adds Kullback-Leibler divergence ?

It is distinct. Alternatively, since bi a pure state and tau Gaussian reference.

However, is [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)] always positive?

Since for rho pure, S(rho )=0． Or if the problem mentioned [tr ... subtract another] as simply the entropy difference?

But during the cursor was wrong? If rho is pure and the reference tau is given as a mixed state, then yes, tr(rho ln rho)=0 and tr(tau ln tau） is negative (since entropy is a positive quantity)？Wait, note that S(tau) is positive, so -S(tau) is negative. Therefore, del_b = -S(tau). However the problem intends to use a measure of fiber船No? So  result could be negative, but supposing non-G ans=rionvar is supposed to be positive? But given [tr(rho ln rho: )=>0 or mixed state thr sledges. Such; but rho is pure, CT State to use Gaussian tau's entropy.

Blazene, typically one uses the non-Gaussianity as S(tau) – S(rho), since non-Gaussian具有增加個mZigbee; however in this case, measure was defined as del_b= tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)=0 - (negative of the entropy? No. Wait wait entropy S(tau)= Post (tau ln tau). Therefore, del_b which equals [tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau)]= (0) – (-S(tau ))'s o heh told that relative entropy measure is del_b= S(rho||tau)= tr(rho(ln rho - ln tau)) ?

delta_b = [trace(rho*\ln(rho)) - trace(tau*\ln(tau))]

That equals = [S(rho) - S(tau)]. Since the von Neumann entropy S(rho)= -tr(rho ln rho). So if I write S(rho)= -tr(rho ln rho), and S(tau)=-tr(tau ln tau), then tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau) = [-S(rho) + S(tau)]= S(tau) - S(rho). But less as rhorho is pure, S(rho)=0, hence del_b= Do —purity'surprised

However, based on the user's definition,

del_b= Tr[rho ln rho] -Tr[tau ln tau] = (-S(rho) ) - (-S(tau )) = S(tau ) - S(rho )

Given that rho is pure, S(rho)= then del_b= S(tau ) - 0 = S(tau ). 

Wait! if enclosed-name,I have the non-Gaussianity as del_b= [tr(rho ln rho ) - tr(tau ln tau )]}}.

But, as user has written the formula:

del_b = [ tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau) ]

Since entropies are S(rho)= -Tr(rho ln rho ), and S(tau)= -Tr( tau ln tau ). Therefore,

del_b= [ -S(rho) ) - ( -S(tau ) ) ]= S(tau) - S(rho )

But for a pure state rho, S(rho)=0, so del_b= S(tau )

Ah! But in this case,

Wait, but let's conduct some details.

 From the previous computation:

nu=1/sqrt(2) approx 0.70710678118

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we follow these steps:

**Given:**
- State: \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N} \)
- Normalization: \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi) e^{-2\alpha^2}} \)
- Parameters: \( \phi = -\pi/4 \), \( \alpha = 0.5 \)
- Measure: \( \delta_b = \text{tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{tr}(\tau \ln \tau) \)

**Step 1: Compute \(

---

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

aggregate all terms.

Term 1: cos^2 phi * alpha.

Terms 2 and 3:

cos phi sin phi term (second term): - cos phi sin phi * alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}

Third term: sin phi cos phi * alpha e^{-2 alpha^2}

Terms 2 and 3 add to zero since - cos phi sin phi * alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} + cos phi sin phi * alpha e^{-2 alpha^2} = 0.

Term4: - sin^2 phi * alpha,

Hence, total <a> = [ cos^2 phi * alpha - sin^2 phi * alpha ] / N^2.

Factor the alpha:

alpha ( cos^2 phi - sin^2 phi ) / N^2. Recognize that cos^2 phi - sin^2 phi = cos(2 phi). Given phi = - pi/4, so cos(2 * (- pi /4)) = cos(-pi/2) = cos(pi/2) = 0. Therefore, cos(2 phi) becomes 0, leading <a> = 0.

Hence, the first moment <a> i, which is displacement in phase space, plasma-like the expectation value of the annihilation operator. Hence, the first moment is zero.

Therefore, the Gaussian reference state tau has displacement (first moments) equal to those of rho, so displacement is zero.

Alternatively, if tau is a Gaussian state with displacement vector identical to that of rho, yeah. Since the displacement is the expected value of the quadrature operators x and p (for real alpha, we can consider x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2), p = (a - a†)/(i sqrt(2)) ). But <a> is zero (as shown above), x also would be zero (as x defined through a and a†), since <a + a†>/sqrt(2) = ( <a> + <a†> ) / sqrt(2) becomes zero. Same for p. Hence, displacement is zero.

Now, compute the second moments, such as <a^2>, <a†^2>, and <a† a> to determine the covariance matrix. However, via rho (which is a pure state)—since it's a superposition, perhaps technically require some effort.

However, knowing that the reference state tau is Gaussian with same first and second moments as rho. Therefore, in principle, determine tau by computing variances and covariance elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state would be a thermal squeezed state or vacuum state? Since the displacement is zero.

Assuming displacement is zero, the reference Gaussian state aims to capture the second moments. Let's compute the variance in x and p, or equivalently, in a and a† operators.

Compute the variances:

<a† a> = expectation value of number operator.

Compute <a† a> for rho. Which is (using a |psi>):

tr(rho a† a) = <a† a> for the state. Using rho = |psi><psi|, it measures <psi| a† a |psi>.

Investigate: find <a† a> = <psi |a† a | psi>.

Similarly, compute <a^2> and compare.

Starting with <a† a>:

<a† a> = [ (cos phi <alpha| + sin phi <-alpha| ) / N ] * a† a [ (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha> ) / N ]

Similarly:

= [ cos^2 phi <alpha | a† a | alpha > + cos phi sin phi <alpha | a† a |-alpha> + sin phi cos phi <-alpha | a† a | alpha > + sin^2 phi <-alpha | a† a |-alpha> ] / N^2

Compute each term:

Term1: Cosine squared phi times <alpha | a† a |alpha>. Coherent states are eigenstates of a, with eigenvalues alpha. Hence, a |alpha> = alpha |alpha>, then a† a |alpha> = alpha* a† | alpha> = alpha* alpha |alpha> = | alpha |^2 |alpha>. Since alpha is real, the term simplifies: |alpha|^2 this is 0.5^2 = 0.25. So <alpha |a† a | alpha> = 0.25.

Similarly, the term <-alpha |a† a |-alpha> = | -alpha |^2 = same value, 0.25.

The cross terms: <alpha | a† a |-alpha> equals <-alpha | a† a | alpha>*, right?

Wait, let's compute <alpha | a† a |-alpha>.

Express a† a | -alpha> = a† a | -alpha> = (-alpha) a† | -alpha > = (-alpha) (- alpha)* ) | -alpha>. Wait, more carefully:

The operator a† a acting on | -alpha> gives a† a | -alpha> = a† ( a | -alpha> ) = a† ( - alpha | -alpha >) = - alpha a† | -alpha >. However, a† | -alpha > = (d/d( -alpha )) | -alpha > or perhaps more straightforwardly, note that | - alpha > is a coherent state located at -alpha. The operator a† is the creation operator, therefore a† | -alpha > creates a photon, but does not shift the coherent state directly. A better approach is:

Since in general, for coherent states, a | beta > = beta | beta >.
Hence, given | -alpha > => a | -alpha > = -alpha | -alpha >. Therefore, a† a | - alph a > = a† ( - alpha | -alpha > ) = - alpha a^† | -alpha >.

Now, expre s s a† | -alpha >. A property is that a† |beta> = (d/d beta + beta*) | beta > but perhaps simpler to compute:

On the other hand, are there known expressions for a† acting on | beta >? Alternatively, recall displacement operator D(beta) |0> = | beta >, and then a | beta > = beta | beta >. Then, in terms of displacement operators:

Define D(beta) = exp( beta a† - beta* a ), hence a D(beta) |0> = beta D(beta) |0>.

To act a† on | beta > = D(beta) |0>,

a† |beta> = a† D(beta) |0> = D(beta) D(beta)^(-1) a† D(beta) |0>.

But via displacement properties: D(beta)^(-1) a D(beta) = a + beta. Thus,

D(beta) a D(beta)^(-1) = a - beta.

Therefore, D(beta)^(-1) a† D(beta) = a† - beta^*

Apply this to a†:

D(beta) a† D(beta)^{-1} = a† + beta^*, therefore

a† = D(beta) (a† + beta^*) D(beta)^{-1} }

Therefore, applying a† to |beta> = D(beta)|0> gives:

a† |beta> = D(beta) ( a† + beta^* ) |0 >. But a† |0> = |1>, so

a† |beta> = D(beta) ( |1> + beta^* |0> )

However, I don’t recall an exact expression. Perhaps the answer here is directly:

Since |beta> is a coherent state,

(Different approach) we can relate a† |beta> by acting on an exponential:

|beta> = e^{- |beta|^2 / 2} e^{beta a†} |0>. Then, a† |beta> = e^{-|beta|^2 / 2} a† e^{beta a†} |0> = e^{-|beta|^2 / 2} ( e^{ beta a† } a† ) |0>.

Differentiate e^{ beta a† } a†: it's the derivative of e^{beta a†} times (something?), perhaps using operator calculus is complicated here. 

Alternatively, generating function perhaps we can consider:

Since acting a† on |beta> = e^{beta a†} |0> e^{ - |beta|^2 / 2 }, then that...Hmmm. This might not be straightforward. Perhaps perhaps defer the accurate evaluation and recognize that a |beta> = beta is known but a† |beta> has no easy expression.

Alternatively, even if we must, perhaps substitute the operator expansion.

Alternatively, realalpasi Let’s perhaps directly compute <alpha |a† a | -alpha>.

But a† a is the number operator N. Thus <alpha | N | -alpha> is calculated as <alpha | N | -alpha>. The coherent state |alpha> is an eigenstate of a, but not N. Still,

Then,

<alpha | a† a | -alpha > = <alpha | N | -alpha >.

This is tr( | -alpha><alpha | N )

However, exactly, what is this quantity? Think in terms of the Fock basis expansion but coherent states are excessive in this regard. Alternatively, perhaps it's possible to derive an analytic form.

Poulin url="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407214" shows)Overall/, non-Gaussianity arises in harmonic oscillators.

But maybe we write the overlap:

Since coherent states are overcomplete, possibly this matrix element can be evaluated.

Express <alpha | N | -alpha>?

Alternatively, recall that coherent state overlaps are:

<alpha | -alpha> = e^{ - |alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2 + ( - | alpha |^2 ) } wait, no. Wait, for real alpha:

< alpha | - alpha > = e^{ - ( |alpha|^2 + | - alpha |^2 ) / 2 + \alpha^* (- alpha ) } because:

Indeed, the general expression is < β | α > = e^{ - ( |β|^2 + |α|^2 ) / 2 + β^* α ) }

So, if both are real: < -alpha | alpha > = e^{ - ( alpha^2 + alpha^2 ) / 2 + (- alpha ) alpha } = e^{ - alpha^2 - alpha^2 - alpha^2 } }= e^{ - 2 alpha^2 }

Wait, in numerator: ( | \beta |2 + |alpha|2 ) / 2 = ( (- alpha)^2 + alpha^2 ) / 2 = ( alpha^2 + alpha^2 ) / 2 = alpha^2. However, beta is -alpha, real，so beta* = -alpha. Thus, the expression yields e^{ - alpha^2 + ( - alpha) * alpha } = e^{ - alpha^2 - alpha^2 }= e^{ - 2 alpha^2 }.

But how does this aid? Here, we need < alpha | N | -alpha >.

Wait, in that e^{ -2 alpha^2 } was critical earlier.

Consider:

Operator N = a† a.

Compute <alpha | N | -alpha > as <alpha | a† a | -alpha >.

But a | -alpha > = -alpha | -alpha >, Thus,

a | -alpha > = -alpha | -alpha >, so

a† a | -alpha > = a† (- alpha ) | -alpha > = - alpha a† | - alpha >.

Thus, < alpha | a† a | - alpha > = - alpha < alpha | a† | - alpha >.

But how do we compute < alpha | a† | - alpha >?

Express < alpha | a† takes the bra as an eigenstate of a (with eigenvalue alpha* since < alpha | a = < alpha | alpha* = alpha < alpha | ), but it works thus:

a† | gamma > = a† e^{ - |gamma|^2 / 2 + gamma a† } | 0 >.

But, perhaps use spontañeow properties of a† on bra:

< alpha | a† = ( a | alpha > )† = ( alpha | alpha > ) † = alpha* < alpha |.

Wait, how?

Yes! Following conjugacy:

Given any state | psi >, < psi | a† is equal to ( a | psi > )†.

If | psi > = | alpha >, then a | alpha > = alpha | alpha > → (a | alpha > )† = alpha* < alpha |.

Therefore, < alpha | a† = alpha* < alpha |.

Thus, < alpha | a† = alpha < alpha | (for real alpha). Hence:

Given that, proceed with < alpha | a† | -alpha > = alpha < alpha | -alpha > = alpha e^{-2 alpha^2 }.

Remember alpha is real here at 0.5, so no issues. Therefore,

< alpha | a† a | - alpha > = - alpha * ( alpha e^{-2 alpha^2 } ) = - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2 }.

Similarly for the term < - alpha | a† a | alpha >. Applying analogous principles,

< - alpha| a† a | alpha > becomes:

a acting on | alpha > gives alpha | alpha >. Then,

a† a | alpha > = alpha a† | alpha >,

then,

< -alpha | a† a | alpha > = alpha < - alpha | a† | alpha > = alpha < -alpha | a† | alpha >.

But the same as earlier,

< - alpha | a† = ( a | - alpha > )† = ( - alpha | - alpha > )† = - alpha < - alpha |.

Therefore,

< - alpha | a† = - alpha < - alpha |,

therefore,

< - alpha | a† | alpha > = - alpha < - alpha | alpha > = - alpha e^{-2 alpha^2 }.

Hence,

< - alpha | a† a | alpha > = alpha ( - alpha e^{-2 alpha^2 } ) = - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2 }.

Thus:

So returning to evaluating <a† a>, integrating terms:

Term1: cos² phi * 0.25

Term2 and term3: cross terms... Second term was cos phi sin phi <alpha | a† a | -alpha > / N^2 + the third term, accordingly.

Wait the entire expression:

< a† a > = ( cos² phi * 0.25 + sin² phi * 0.25 + cos phi sin phi ( - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2 } ) + sin phi cos phi ( - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2 } )) / N^2.

Take terms:

cos² phi * 0.25 + sin² phi * 0.25 = 0.25( cos² phi + sin² phi ) ) ) = 0.25.

Then the cross terms:

cos phi sin phi ( - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2 } ) * 2 (since terms 2 and 3 are similar)?

Because second term generates cos phi sin phi multiplied by the first cross term which is - alpha^2 e^{- 2 alpha^2 }, and the third yields the same as sin phi cos phi multiplied by (again, the other cross term also results in - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2 } ). Thus, we can group them as: the cross terms sum to [2 cos phi sin phi (- alpha^2 e^{ - 2 alpha^2 } ) ]

Hence,

< a† a > = ( 0.25 + 2 cos phi sin phi ( - alpha^2 e^{- 2 alpha^2 } ) ) / N^2

But given that phi is -pi /4, then phi has sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2, cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2. Perhaps compute 2 cos phi sin phi.

2 cos phi sin phi = sin(2 phi ) = sin (-pi/2) = -1. Therefore, cross terms reduces to [ ( -1 ) (- alpha ^2 e^{-2 alpha^2 }) ] => alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2 }

Hence,

< a† a > = (0.25 + alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2 } ) / N^2.

Moreover, N^2 computes as (1 + sin(2 phi) e^{ - 2 alpha^2 } ) with phi = -pi/4.

Hm, Recall N^2 = 1 + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2 }

As phi=-pi/4, sin(2 phi )= sin(-pi/2 ) = -1. Therefore,

N^2 =1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}

Given that we stated alpha=0.5,

Thus, computing N squared, 1 - e^{-2 *0.25 }=1 - e^{-0.5 }≈1 - 0.6065 ≈0.3935.

Similarly, <a† a> = [0.25 + (0.5)^2 e^{-0.5 } ] / (0.3935)

So 0.25 + (0.25)(0.6065)=0.25 +0.1516=0.4016. Divided by N^2 0.3935, yields approx 0.4016 / 0.3935 ≈1.0206.

So, <a† a>≈1.0206. Alternatively, maybe hold values symbolically.

Is that reasonable? Yes, if it’s a. sigma exceptional precision 1.02 etc. Indicative. 

Additionally, compute expctation value of other moments such as <a^2>, <a†²>, critical for mending variance and covariance matrix.

Nonetheless, given rho exists as a pure state probability known, being |psi><psi|. The von Neumann entropy S(rho)=0. Handling tau as a Gaussian state with identical first and second moments. Our challenge nowis to calc the entropy S(tau). The entropy S of a Gaussian state candidate munched if the sorted state . Yet. Pending complications here, but hinging on tools.

Prepare to define the Gaussian state tau. If we derived the covariance matrix, crucial.

Second moments involve variances leverand co variace; ТThe correlation functions.

Position and momentumoperators:

x = (a + a†) / sqrt(2)

p = (a - a†) / (i sqrt(2))

Hence, the covariance matrix Sigma as:

sigma = [ sigma_xx, sigma_xp

sigma_px, sigma_ pp ]

with:

sigma_xx = <x²> - <x>² = <x²>

Similarly,

sigma_pp = <p²> - <p>² = <p²>

sigma_xp = < (x p + p x)/2 > - <x><p>

But <x> and <p> are 0, so sigma_xp = < (x p + p x)/2 >

Then, performing calculus:

Start with <x²>, need to:

<a²>, <(a†)^2>, <a† a>, and <a a†>守  back to conventional case.

Let's compute <x²> which equals (a + a†)^2/2 => [a² + (a†)^2 + a a† + a† a ] / 2.

Thus, <x²>= ( <a²> + <(a†)^2> + <a a†> + <a† a> ) /2

Similarly, <p²>= - ( <a²> + <(a†)^2> - <a a†> - <a† a> ) /2

Because p² = -(a - a†)^2 /2   Gamma成分 issue...

Expression of p² is negative squared quantity: [ (a - a†)^2 ] / ( -2 )

Else, all in correct for x and p coordinates.

First, compute <a^2>, <(a†)^2>, and <a a†>.

We can compute:

Given rho = |psi><psi|,

quantities:

<a²> = <psi | a² | psi>
<(a†)^2>= <psi | (a†)^2 | psi>
<aa†>= <psi | a a† | psi>

Start with <a²>:

Similarly to prior steps, use the expansion:

| psi > = (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N.

Therefore,

a^2 | psi>x> => a^2 | psi> = [cos phi * alpha^2 |alpha> + sin phi * (-alpha)^2 | -alpha> ] / N.

Thus,

< psi |a^2 | psi> = [ cos^2 phi alpha^2 <alpha | alpha> + sin^2 phi alpha^2 <-alpha| - alpha> + cos phi sin phi alpha^2 <alpha | - alpha> + sin phi cos phi alpha^2 <-alpha | alpha> ] / N^2

But <alpha | alpha> is 1, likewise for <-alpha | - alpha>. The CrossApos:

<alpha | - alpha>= e^{-2 alpha^2 }

And <-alpha | alpha> = e^{-2 alpha^2 }

Therefore,

< a² > becomes:

[ cos^2 phi alpha^2 + sin^2 phi alpha^2 + cos phi sin phi alpha^2 (e^{-2 alpha^2 } + e^{-2 alpha^2 }) ] / N^2

This simplifies:

alpha^2 [ (cos² phi + sin² phi ) + 2 cos phi sin phi e^{-2 alpha^2 } ] / N^2

But (cos² phi + sin² phi ) = 1, hence:

< a² > = [alpha^2 ( 1 + 2 cos phi sin phi e^{- 2 alpha^2 } ) ] / N^2

Given phi -pi/4:

Trigonometric substituonsenses:

 cos phi = sqrt(2)/2, sin phi = -sqrt(2)/2,

cos phi sin phi = (-2)/4 = -1/2.

Hence:

< a²> = [ alpha^2 (1 + 2*(-1/2) e^{-2 alpha^2 }) ] / N^2

Which is [alpha^2 (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2} ) ] / N^2

Since N square i is 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2 }, thus cancels denominator, leading <a²> = alpha^2.

So with alpha=0.5, <a²> =0.25. Which is impressive.

Similarly, <( a† )²> =. <a^2>* becomes compute < psi | (a†)^2 | psi > in equalice to [ ].

If | psi > is real? Due to specifica atines (phi is real?

The if state properties are considered:

In this code, given phi=-pi/4, correspondingly, the state comprises equal charges of |alpha> and negative |- alpha>.

But in this case:

<(a†)^2>in= ( < psi | (a†)^2 | psi > ).

A s | psi > is (cos phi | a lpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N.

Thus, expanding indeed,

The first term:

For <alpha | (a†)^2 | alpha >, using the fact that acting a† on |alpha> increases photon number, but for coherent states, which are superpositions of Fock states, expect this to blow up.

Thus,

< alpha | a†^2 | alpha > = (alpha* )^2. Since our alpha is real, this is alpha^2.

Similarly, < - alpha | (a†)^2 | - alpha > equals ( (- alpha )* )^2 = alpha^2.

 <a²> = [ alpha² ( 1 +2 * cos(phi ) sin(phi ) e^{-2 alphadist^2} ) ]/ N².

 Foกรient phiof equals to -pi/4.


 >> Substitute phi Here:

s mentioned before with phi = -pi/ ., sin(2 phi) = -1, of which 2 cos phi sin(phi) = sin(2 phi) = -1.

Therefore:

 <a²> = alpha^2 (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2 })/ N^2。

 But earlier established, since' cuote hem? Because the N^2 also is （1 - α#’s factor. Importantly, as already substituted:

Since N^2 =1 -,e^{-2 alpha^2 }, thus, Partial:

 <a^2> = alpha^2. For cunado they must canceled.

 ... Ah! Yeah.

Therefore, < a^2 > in this case produces alpha squared.  TechAlpha we clean idealism.

 Furthermore, similarly, < (a†)^2%gain? esperaba<...
 <(a†)^2> passes conjugating <a²>  so that < (a†)^2> = (<a²>)^*, which is same because our alpha is real. Hence, this would translate to alpha^2.

So:

<(a†)^2> = <a^2> = alpha² =0.25。

Similarly, requisite <a of J + a a† :

< a a† > earnings. For generally, a a†= a† a +1. Thus,

< a a† > = < a† a> +1.

 Breath we already referenced   had <a (arrancar is:

<a^(ar ) a> ≈1.0206.   So,

< a a† > =1.0206 +1 =2.0206.

 wait our previous ore result, derived < a† a>

Given prior calculation,<a† a>≈1.0206 for alpha=0.5 and phi= -pi /4. Hence, < a a† > =2.0206.

 Therefore, back to <x²>:

value us： ⟨x²⟩=  [⟨a² ⟩+⟨ (a†)^2⟩+⟨a a†⟩+⟨a+† a⟩]/2.

 Provided our calculations:

 all addends computed：

〈a²〉=0.25（ deduced previously)。

〈(a†)^2〉=0.25.

⟨a a†⟩=' around 2. ’,ending in 02063.

⟨a† a⟩ =约 1.0206.

Thus,

〈 xSquarered 〉= (0.25 +0.25 +772 .0206 +1.0206 ) / 2

Add terms:

0.25+0.25=0.5

Yes. Therefore, aggregating:
