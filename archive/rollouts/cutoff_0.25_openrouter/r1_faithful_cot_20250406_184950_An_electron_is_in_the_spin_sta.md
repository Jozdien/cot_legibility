To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we follow these steps:

1. **Normalize the state vector**:
   The given state vector is \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). The norm squared is calculated as:
   \[
   \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25
   \]
   The normalized state vector is:
   \[
   | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Compute the conjugate transpose**:
   The conjugate transpose of the normalized state vector is:
   \[
   \langle \psi | = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

3. **Matrix multiplication with the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \)**:
   The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) is:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   First, multiply \( \langle \psi | \) by \( \sigma_y \):
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

4. **Multiply by the normalized state vector**:
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{25} \left( 4i \cdot 3i + (-3) \cdot 4 \right)
   \]
   Calculate each term:
   \[
   4i \cdot 3i = 12i^2 = -12 \quad \text{and} \quad -3 \cdot 4 = -12
   \]
   Summing these terms:
   \[
   -12 - 12 = -24
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{-24}{25}
   \]

5. **Compute the expectation value of \( S_y \)**:
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \). Thus, the expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}
   \]

The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \boxed{-\dfrac{12 \hbar}{25}}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in the spin state given by the vector (3i, 4). Hmm, let me recall how expectation values work in quantum mechanics. I think the expectation value of an observable is calculated by taking the bra vector, multiplying by the operator matrix, then multiplying by the ket vector. So, ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. 

First, let me write down the spin state. The state vector is (3i, 4). But wait, in quantum mechanics, vectors are usually represented as column vectors. So, the ket |ψ⟩ is a column vector with entries 3i and 4. The bra ⟨ψ| would then be the conjugate transpose, which is (-3i, 4*), but wait, 4 is a real number, so its complex conjugate is still 4. So ⟨ψ| is (-3i, 4). 

Now, the spin operator S_y is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y. The problem statement gives σ_y as:
 
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

But since we're dealing with expectation values, maybe we can ignore the ħ/2 factor for now and just compute the expectation value in terms of σ_y, then multiply by ħ/2 at the end. Wait, but actually, the units probably matter here. Let me check. The spin angular momentum components are indeed (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices, so S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ would be (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y. 

So maybe I can compute ⟨σ_y⟩ first and then multiply by ħ/2. Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's confirm the state vector. The given state is (3i, 4). So |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = [3i]
          [4 ]

Then, ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose, which would be [-3i, 4]. 

Now, σ_y is the matrix:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

So, to compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩, we need to perform matrix multiplication. Let me write this out explicitly.

First, multiply ⟨ψ| (which is a 1x2 row vector) by σ_y (a 2x2 matrix). Let's compute that first.

⟨ψ| σ_y = [-3i, 4] * [0   -i]
                      [i    0]

Multiplying the first element: (-3i)(0) + 4(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i

Multiplying the second element: (-3i)(-i) + 4(0) = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3

So ⟨ψ| σ_y = [4i, -3]

Now, multiply this result by |ψ⟩, which is the column vector [3i; 4]:

[4i, -3] * [3i] = 4i*(3i) + (-3)*(4)
             [4 ]

Compute each term:

First term: 4i * 3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12

Second term: -3 * 4 = -12

So total is -12 + (-12) = -24

Therefore, ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24

But wait, expectation values are usually normalized. Wait, but the state vector here might not be normalized. Oh! I forgot to normalize the state vector first. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, i.e., their inner product should be 1. Let me check the normalization of the given state.

The given state is |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4). The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (3^2)(i^2) + 16. Wait, no, |3i|^2 is (3i)(-3i) = 9*1 = 9, since |a + bi|^2 = a^2 + b^2. Wait, no, actually, for a complex number z = a + bi, |z|^2 = a^2 + b^2. But here, the components are 3i and 4. So 3i is 0 + 3i, so |3i|^2 = 0^2 + 3^2 = 9. Similarly, |4|^2 = 16. So the total norm squared is 9 + 16 = 25. Therefore, the norm is 5. So the normalized state vector is (3i/5, 4/5). 

But wait, the problem didn't specify whether the given state is normalized. Hmm. In quantum mechanics, expectation values require normalized states. Otherwise, you have to divide by the norm squared. Wait, let me recall. The expectation value of an operator A in a state |ψ⟩ is ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. So if the state isn't normalized, you have to compute ⟨A⟩ = (⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩). 

In this problem, the state is given as (3i, 4). Let me check if the problem expects us to assume it's normalized. The question says "an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4)". Typically, spin states are given as vectors, which may or may not be normalized. But in standard QM, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. However, sometimes problems give non-normalized vectors and expect you to normalize them first. 

Given that the components are 3i and 4, which have a norm squared of 25, so the normalized state would be (3i/5, 4/5). But let's check the problem statement again. It says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y." It doesn't mention anything about normalization. Hmm. 

Wait, but expectation value is defined as ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if the state isn't normalized. So if the state isn't normalized, we have to divide by the norm squared. But maybe in this problem, they just give the state vector and expect you to compute ⟨S_y⟩ as ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, assuming that the state is already normalized. But in this case, the state isn't normalized. So perhaps we need to normalize it first. 

Wait, let's check. If we proceed without normalizing, we get ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24, and then ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24). But if we normalize, then ⟨σ_y⟩ would be (-24)/25, and ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25). 

Which is correct? Let me think. The expectation value formula is ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. So if the vector is not normalized, you have to divide by the norm squared. Therefore, in this case, since the vector (3i, 4) has a norm squared of 25, the expectation value would be (⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩)/25 multiplied by ħ/2. 

Therefore, the answer should be ( -24 / 25 ) * ħ/2 = (-12/25)ħ. 

But let me confirm this. Let's recast the problem. Suppose |ψ⟩ is not normalized. Then the expectation value is ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ | ψ⟩. 

So first compute ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩, which we did as -24*(ħ/2). Then divide by ⟨ψ | ψ⟩, which is 25. So ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24ħ/2)/25 = (-12ħ)/25. 

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be -12ħ/25. 

But let me check my steps again to be sure. 

First, the state vector is (3i, 4). So |ψ⟩ = 3i |↑_z⟩ + 4 |↓_z⟩, assuming the standard basis. 

Compute ⟨ψ | ψ⟩ = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25. 

Compute ⟨ψ | σ_y | ψ⟩:

First, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

So, ⟨ψ | σ_y | ψ⟩ = [ -3i  4 ] * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [3i; 4]

First multiply [ -3i  4 ] by σ_y:

First component: (-3i)(0) + 4*(i) = 4i

Second component: (-3i)(-i) + 4*(0) = 3i^2 + 0 = -3

So the row vector is [4i, -3]

Multiply by the column vector [3i; 4]:

4i*3i + (-3)*4 = 12i^2 -12 = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24

Therefore, ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24 / 25

Hence, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = -12ħ/25

So the expectation value is -12ħ/25. 

But wait, the problem says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y." So unless specified otherwise, we can write the answer in terms of ħ. But maybe they want it in terms of ħ/2 units? Let me check the units. Spin operators are usually written as S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, so the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. Therefore, the expectation value would indeed be in units of ħ/2 multiplied by the expectation value of σ_y. 

But since we already computed ⟨σ_y⟩ as -24/25, then ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = -12ħ/25. 

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in terms of ħ, then that's the answer. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the state is normalized. Wait, but in that case, the components would have to be divided by 5. Let's check that case. 

If the state is normalized, then |ψ⟩ = (3i/5, 4/5). Then ⟨ψ| is (-3i/5, 4/5). Then ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩:

First multiply [ -3i/5  4/5 ] by σ_y:

First component: (-3i/5)(0) + (4/5)(i) = 4i/5

Second component: (-3i/5)(-i) + (4/5)(0) = (3i^2)/5 + 0 = -3/5

So the row vector is [4i/5, -3/5]

Multiply by [3i/5; 4/5]:

(4i/5)(3i/5) + (-3/5)(4/5) = (12i^2)/25 + (-12)/25 = (-12)/25 -12/25 = -24/25

So ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24/25, same as before. Then ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = -12ħ/25. 

So regardless of whether we normalize first or account for normalization in the expectation value formula, we get the same result. 

Therefore, the expectation value of S_y is -12ħ/25. 

But let me check once more for calculation errors. 

First, the components:

Original state: 3i and 4. 

Conjugate transpose: -3i and 4. 

Multiplying by σ_y:

First element: (-3i)(0) + 4*(i) = 4i

Second element: (-3i)*(-i) + 4*(0) = 3i^2 = -3

Then multiplying by the original vector:

4i*(3i) + (-3)*4 = 12i^2 -12 = -12 -12 = -24

Divide by norm squared 25: -24/25

Multiply by ħ/2: -12ħ/25

Yes, that seems correct. 

Alternatively, if I use the normalized vector from the start:

Normalized vector components: 3i/5 and 4/5

Compute ⟨σ_y⟩:

Conjugate transpose: (-3i/5, 4/5)

Multiply by σ_y:

First component: (-3i/5)(0) + (4/5)(i) = 4i/5

Second component: (-3i/5)(-i) + (4/5)(0) = (3i^2)/5 = -3/5

Multiply by normalized vector:

(4i/5)(3i/5) + (-3/5)(4/5) = (12i^2)/25 -12/25 = (-12 -12)/25 = -24/25

Same result. 

Therefore, the expectation value is indeed -12ħ/25. 

So the answer should be \boxed{-\dfrac{12 \hbar}{25}}.

**Final Answer**
The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \boxed{-\dfrac{12 \hbar}{25}}.

Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in the spin state given by the vector (3i, 4). Hmm, let me recall how expectation values work in quantum mechanics. I think the expectation value of an observable is calculated by taking the bra vector, multiplying by the operator matrix, then multiplying by the ket vector. So, ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. 

First, let me write down the spin state. The state vector is (3i, 4). But wait, in quantum mechanics, vectors are usually represented as column vectors. So, the ket |ψ⟩ is a column vector with entries 3i and 4. The bra ⟨ψ| would then be the conjugate transpose, which is (-3i, 4*), but wait, 4 is a real number, so its complex conjugate is still 4. So ⟨ψ| is (-3i, 4). 

Now, the spin operator S_y is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y. The problem statement gives σ_y as:
 
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

But since we're dealing with expectation values, maybe we can ignore the ħ/2 factor for now and just compute the expectation value in terms of σ_y, then multiply by ħ/2 at the end. Wait, but actually, the units probably matter here. Let me check. The spin angular momentum components are indeed (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices, so S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ would be (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y. 

So maybe I can compute ⟨σ_y⟩ first and then multiply by ħ/2. Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's confirm the state vector. The given state is (3i, 4). So |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = [3i]
          [4 ]

Then, ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose, which would be [-3i, 4]. 

Now, σ_y is the matrix:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

So, to compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩, we need to perform matrix multiplication. Let me write this out explicitly.

First, multiply ⟨ψ| (which is a 1x2 row vector) by σ_y (a 2x2 matrix). Let's compute that first.

⟨ψ| σ_y = [-3i, 4] * [0   -i]
                      [i    0]

Multiplying the first element: (-3i)(0) + 4(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i

Multiplying the second element: (-3i)(-i) + 4(0) = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3

So ⟨ψ| σ_y = [4i, -3]

Now, multiply this result by |ψ⟩, which is the column vector [3i; 4]:

[4i, -3] * [3i] = 4i*(3i) + (-

Alright, to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, ⟨S_y⟩, for an electron in the given spin state (3i, 4), I need to recall that the expectation value of an observable in quantum mechanics is calculated by multiplying the bra vector, the operator matrix, and the ket vector. Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ can be expressed as ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

The state vector (3i, 4) should be represented as a column vector in quantum mechanics, with the ket |ψ⟩ having entries 3i and 4. The corresponding bra ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose, which is (-3i, 4), since 4 is a real number and its complex conjugate remains 4.

The spin operator S_y is given by (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix σ_y. The problem statement provides σ_y as:

[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

To simplify the calculation, I'll first compute the expectation value of σ_y, denoted as ⟨σ_y⟩, and then multiply the result by ħ/2 to obtain ⟨S_y⟩, as the spin angular momentum components are defined as (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

Let's confirm the state vector once again. The given state (3i, 4) implies that |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = [3i]
      [4 ]

Consequently, ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose, which is [-3i, 4].

To compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩, I'll perform matrix multiplication step by step. First, I'll multiply ⟨ψ| (a 1x2 row vector) by σ_y (a 2x2 matrix).

⟨ψ| σ_y = [-3i, 4] * [0   -i]
                      [i    0]

Multiplying the first element yields (-3i)(0) + 4(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i, while multiplying the second element gives (-3i)(-i) + 4(0) = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

Thus, ⟨ψ| σ_y = [4i, -3].

Next, I'll multiply this result by |ψ⟩, which is the column vector [3i; 4]:

[4i, -3] * [3i] = 4i*(3i) + (-3)*4 = -12 - 12 = -24

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron with the spin state represented by the vector (3i, 4). Let me remind myself about how to calculate expectation values in quantum mechanics. As I remember, the expectation value of an observable is found by taking the bra vector, multiplying it by the operator matrix, and then multiplying by the ket vector. Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

First, let's express the spin state. The vector state is (3i, 4), but in quantum mechanics, vectors are often presented as column vectors. Thus, the ket |ψ⟩ is a column vector with elements 3i and 4. The bra ⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose, which should be (-3i, 4*), but since 4 is a real number, its complex conjugate is also 4. So, ⟨ψ| becomes (-3i, 4).

The spin operator S_y is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y, where the matrix σ_y is:

[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

Considering the expectation values, perhaps we can disregard the ħ/2 factor temporarily and calculate the expectation value using σ_y, and afterward, multiply by ħ/2. But it's likely that units are crucial here. Let me verify this. It's true that the components of spin angular momentum are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices, implying S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. Hence, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ would be (ħ/2) times ⟨σ_y⟩.

Let's compute ⟨σ_y⟩ initially and multiply by ħ/2 later. I'll go through this step-by-step.

Firstly, confirming the state vector, we have |ψ⟩ as:

|ψ⟩ = [3i]
          [4]

Subsequently, ⟨ψ|, the conjugate transpose, is [-3i, 4].

Given σ_y is the matrix:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

To determine ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩, we perform matrix multiplication. I'll write this comprehensively.

Initially, multiply ⟨ψ| (as a 1x2 row vector) with σ_y (a 2x2 matrix). Let's check that first.

⟨ψ| σ_y = [-3i, 4] * [0   -i]
                      [i    0]

Multiply the first term: (-3i)(0) + 4(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i

Multiply the second term: (-3i)(-i) + 4(0) = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3

Hence, ⟨ψ| σ_y results in [4i, -3]

Afterward, multiply this by |ψ⟩, which is the column vector [3i; 4]:

[4i, -3] * [3i] = 4i*(3i) + (-

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \((3i, 4)\), we follow these steps:

1. **Normalize the given spin state**:
   The given spin state is \(| \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\). The norm squared is:
   \[
   \| \psi \|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25
   \]
   Therefore, the normalized state is:
   \[
   | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Compute the conjugate transpose (bra vector)**:
   The conjugate transpose of the normalized state is:
   \[
   \langle \psi | = \left( -\frac{3i}{5}, \frac{4}{5} \right)
   \]

3. **Matrix multiplication of \(\langle \psi | \sigma_y \)**:
   Using the Pauli matrix \(\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}\):
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y = \left( -\frac{3i}{5}, \frac{4}{5} \right) \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \left( \frac{4i}{5}, -\frac{3}{5} \right)
   \]

4. **Multiply the result by \(| \psi \rangle \)**:
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \left( \frac{4i}{5}, -\frac{3}{5} \right) \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \frac{4i}{5} \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + \left( -\frac{3}{5} \right) \cdot \frac{4}{5}
   \]
   Simplifying the terms:
   \[
   \frac{12i^2}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = \frac{-12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = \frac{-24}{25}
   \]

5. **Compute the expectation value \( \langle S_y \rangle \)**:
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is given by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \). Therefore, the expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}
   \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{12 \hbar}{25}}
\]

3)*(4) = 12i^2 - 12 = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24

Therefore, the expectation value ⟨σ_y⟩ is -24. Then, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12ħ. Wait, but hold on. Hold on. Let's check again.

Wait, first, let's verify the calculation. Let me go through again step by step.

⟨ψ| σ_y = [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by the matrix σ_y:

First component of ⟨ψ| σ_y is (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i

Second component is (-3i)(-i) + 4*0 = (3i^2) + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3

So yes, ⟨ψ| σ_y = [4i, -3]

Then multiplying by |ψ⟩ which is [3i; 4]:

(4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4) = 12i^2 -12 = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24

So σ_y expectation is -24? But wait, the state vector (3i, 4) must be normalized, right? Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized, but maybe this one isn't. Wait, the problem statement just says "an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4)", so perhaps we need to normalize it first. That's a common oversight. So perhaps I made a mistake here by not normalizing the state. Let me check.

Given the spin state vector |ψ⟩ = (3i, 4). The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25. So the normalization factor is 1/5. Therefore, the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). So, perhaps the user didn't mention normalization, but in actual calculations of expectation values, we have to use the normalized state. Because otherwise, if the vector isn't normalized, the expectation value also has a scaling factor. So, in this problem, since they just give the spin state as (3i,4), and ask for the expectation value, I think it's expected that we first normalize the state.

But actually, wait. Let's check again the definition. The expectation value of an operator A is ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if the state is not normalized. But in many cases, especially in textbook problems, when a state is given as a column vector, it's sometimes assumed that it's already normalized, but here the norm squared is 25, so unless stated otherwise, if the problem gives (3i,4), is that supposed to be already normalized? However, given the entries are 3i and 4, it's clear that their squared magnitudes sum to 25, which is greater than 1, so it's not normalized. Therefore, we need to normalize the state first before computing the expectation value.

Therefore, I need to correct my previous computation. Let me redo the calculation with the normalized state.

First, original |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4], norm squared is 9 + 16 =25, so the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). Therefore, |ψ⟩ normalized is:

|ψ⟩ = [3i/5]
          [4/5 ]

Then, ⟨ψ| is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ]

Now compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩:

First, compute ⟨ψ| σ_y:

[ -3i/5, 4/5 ] * [0  -i]
                              [i   0]

First element: (-3i/5)*0 + (4/5)*i = 0 + 4i/5

Second element: (-3i/5)*(-i) + (4/5)*0 = (3i^2)/5 + 0 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5

So ⟨ψ| σ_y = [4i/5, -3/5]

Then, multiply by |ψ⟩:

(4i/5)*(3i/5) + (-3/5)*(4/5) = (12i^2)/25 - 12/25 = (12*(-1))/25 - 12/25 = -12/25 -12/25 = -24/25

So the expectation value ⟨σ_y⟩ is -24/25. Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-12/25)ħ

But the question asks to find the expectation value of S_y, so probably they just want the numerical factor times ħ/2 or something. Wait, let me check units.

In most quantum mechanics contexts, the expectation value of spin is given in terms of ħ/2. Since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Therefore, the expectation value must be some multiple of ħ/2.

In our case, ⟨S_y⟩ = (⟨σ_y⟩) * (ħ/2). The ⟨σ_y⟩ we calculated as -24/25, so ⟨S_y⟩ is (-24/25)*(ħ/2) = (-12/25) ħ. Hmm, but the problem doesn’t specify whether they need the answer in terms of ħ or just the numerical coefficient. However, let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y." And they gave σ_y matrix. In some textbooks, they define the spin operators as S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, so yes, the expectation value would indeed be (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation of σ_y.

But given that the problem didn’t mention ħ, maybe they want the answer in terms of ħ, so we can write it as (−12/25)(ħ/2)? Wait, no. Wait, let's confirm our steps again.

Wait no: If S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, then ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨σ_y⟩. But ⟨σ_y⟩, in our normalized state, is -24/25. Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = (-24/50)ħ = (-12/25)ħ. 

Alternatively, maybe I should rationalize whether the answer is requested as a numerical multiple of ħ/2. Let's see. For example, if ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24/25, then that's the same as (-24/25), so ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25). So its expectation value is a scalar multiple of ħ/2. Alternatively, it's conventional to express expectation values of spin in units of ħ/2. So for example, if you have a spin-1/2 particle, then the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Therefore, in this case, the expectation value is (-24/25)(ħ/2). But maybe the answer is to be given just as that coefficient times ħ/2, but maybe since the problem says to use the given σ_y, I need to just compute (⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩) which when you express S_y as (ħ/2) σ_y. But the exact way depends on the problem's requirement. 

Alternatively, maybe since S_y is given by the Pauli matrix multiplied by a constant, but the problem states "find the expectation value of S_y" so they probably want the answer in terms of ħ. Although, wait, in some systems of units, ħ is set to 1. But the problem doesn't say so. If it's written in terms of having the Pauli matrices, maybe the answer should be written with ħ. Let's make sure. 

Wait, actually, the problem didn't mention anything about units, just says "find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y", and provided the matrix for σ_y. Given that the actual spin angular momentum operator is S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y. So surely we need to include the ħ/2 factor. So based on that, our computation came out to being (-24/25)*(ħ/2) = (-12ħ)/25. So is that the answer? Let me verify once again each step to be sure.

First, normalization: |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4], norm is sqrt(9 + 16)=5, so normalized state is [3i/5; 4/5]. Correct.

Compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩:

⟨ψ| is [-3i/5, 4/5]

Multiply by σ_y matrix:

First element: (-3i/5)*0 + (4/5)*i = (4i)/5

Second element: (-3i/5)*(-i) + (4/5)*0 = 3i²/5 = -3/5

So row vector [4i/5, -3/5]

Multiply by column vector |ψ⟩ = [3i/5; 4/5]:

First term: (4i/5)*(3i/5) = (12i²)/25 = -12/25

Second term: (-3/5)*(4/5) = -12/25

Total sum: -12/25 -12/25 = -24/25. So yes, that part is correct.

Multiply by (ħ/2): ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24/25)(ħ/2) = (-12/25)ħ. So yeah, that seems right. Therefore, the expectation value is -12ħ/25. 

But let me check numerically, maybe for example, if in case we didn't normalize the state, what would we get?

Original state: [3i,4], then ⟨σ_y⟩ was computed as -24. Then, ⟨S_y⟩ would be (-24)(ħ/2) = -12ħ. But since the vector wasn't normalized, but the expectation value formula inherently divides by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩. So in the state not normalized, the expression is (⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ ) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩ ). But the original computation gives ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = -24*(ħ/2) and ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ =25. So this would be (-24*(ħ/2))/25 = same as above: -12ħ/25. So regardless of which approach, the result is -12/25 times ħ. Therefore, the answer is -12ħ/25. 

Is there a chance that they expect the answer in terms of a different factor? Is there any chance I made a wrong assumption in the normalization?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the state is already normalized? If that were the case, even though the coefficients are 3i and 4, with norm squared 25, but if for some convention, maybe they write states without normalization. Wait, but in standard quantum mechanics, expectation values require normalized states. So even if the user gave a non-normalized state, ⟨S_y⟩ is computed as (⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩). Therefore, unless instructed otherwise, the answer must be normalized.

Therefore, I conclude that my calculation is correct, -12ħ/25. But to check, let's choose a test case. For example, suppose the state is [1;0], spin up along z. What is ⟨S_y⟩? Well, ⟨S_y⟩ for that state would be ( ħ/2 ) [1 0] σ_y [1;0] = (ħ/2)(0) =0. Which makes sense. If we have an eigenstate of S_z, the expectation value of S_y is zero, which aligns with that. Similarly, if we have the state (1,1)/sqrt(2), then ⟨S_y⟩ would be... (1/sqrt(2)) [1 1] σ_y (1/sqrt(2)) [1;1] = (1/2)[1 1] ( [-i, -i] ?) Wait, need to compute σ_y times [1;1]. Let me not get bogged down, but the test case shows that if you do the calculation and do the proper normalization, it works.

In our problem, since we initially had non-normalized state, we had to divide by 25. Therefore, the expectation value is -12ħ/25. However, maybe the problem expects units where ħ=1? The problem doesn't specify, but in most cases, even if ħ=1 is used, one should still write it. If the answer is presented as -12/25, but considering the matrix is given without any factors, perhaps in some books they define σ_y as the spin operator by including the ħ/2 factor, but the problem here specifies σ_y as the standard Pauli matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Therefore, the S_y operator is (ħ/2)σ_y. Therefore, the result must have the ħ/2 factor, so ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24/25)*(ħ/2) = -12ħ/25. Therefore, that's the expectation value. Therefore, I think this is the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the assistant can confirm arithmetic, but perhaps to check again:

Multiply row vector [4i/5, -3/5] by column vector [3i/5; 4/5], we have:

4i/5 * 3i/5 = (12 i^2)/25 = -12/25

-3/5 *4/5 = -12/25

Total = -24/25.

Multiply by ħ/2: -24/25 * ħ/2 = -12/25 ħ.

So that's correct. So the final answer is -12ħ/25. So given in the problem statement, how are they expecting the answer? Since the problem references S_y, which is (ħ/2)σ_y, the assistant must present the answer as a multiple of ħ. So boxed as -12ħ/25. However, in some literature, like if we use natural units where ħ=1, but the problem doesn't specify that. So to be precise, the answer is (-12/25)(ħ/2), but that's equivalent to -6ħ/25? Wait, no, wait:

Hold on. Wait, no. S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y. So the expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| (ħ/2 σ_y) |ψ⟩. So this is equal to (ħ/2)⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩. But if the state isn't normalized, then this is (ħ/2)(⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ ), but since the user didn't normalize the state, we have to compute (⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ ) / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ multiplied by ħ/2. So, in the original unnormalized vector, we have:

The inner product ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is 3i*(-3i) +4*4 = -9i² +16 = 9 +16=25.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/25)(ħ/2)(⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ )

But earlier, the calculation without normalization gives ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = -24. Then:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24)/25 = (-24ħ)/50 = (-12ħ)/25, which is the same as before. Therefore, regardless of how you approach it, you get the same answer.

Therefore, after thorough checking, I believe the expectation value is -12ħ/25 or written as -12ℏ/25 (assuming ħ is replaced by h-bar symbol). Therefore, in boxed notation, \boxed{-\dfrac{12}{25} \dfrac{\hbar}{2}}? Wait, but wait, the multiplication by ħ/2 must be considered. Wait no: To clarify:

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is equal to (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation value of σ_y. Which we found the expectation value of σ_y was (-24/25). Therefore, it is ħ/2 multiplied by -24/25: 

⟨S_y⟩ = \boxed{-\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar}

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, no: ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24/50)ħ = (-12/25)ħ. Therefore, probably better written as \boxed{-\dfrac{12}{25} \dfrac{\hbar}{2}}? No, because S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, so when we calculate ⟨S_y⟩, it is (ħ/2) times ⟨σ_y⟩. So if we already accounted for ⟨σ_y⟩ being -24/25 as calculated, then total ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-12/25) ħ, as 24 divided by 2 is 12, so yeah, (-12/25) ħ. So the final answer is:

\boxed{-\dfrac{12 \hbar}{25}}

Alternatively, written as \boxed{ -\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar }, which is equivalent.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{12 \hbar}{25}}

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction \( \langle S_y \rangle \) for an electron in the spin state \( (3i, 4) \):

1. **Normalize the Spin State**:
   The given spin state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). The norm squared is calculated as:
   \[
   \| \psi \|^2 = (-3i)(3i) + 4 \cdot 4 = 9 + 16 = 25
   \]
   The normalized state is:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{norm}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Compute the Expectation Value of \( \sigma_y \)**:
   The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) is:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_y \rangle \) is computed as:
   \[
   \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | \sigma_y | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle
   \]
   First, calculate \( \psi_{\text{norm}}^\dagger \sigma_y \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{-3i}{5}, \frac{4}{5} \right) \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \left( \frac{-3i}{5} \cdot 0 + \frac{4}{5} \cdot i, \frac{-3i}{5} \cdot (-i) + \frac{4}{5} \cdot 0 \right) = \left( \frac{4i}{5}, \frac{-3}{5} \right)
   \]
   Then multiply by \( \psi_{\text{norm}} \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{4i}{5}, \frac{-3}{5} \right) \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \frac{4i}{5} \cdot \frac{3i}{5} + \frac{-3}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{12i^2}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = \frac{-12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = \frac{-24}{25}
   \]

3. **Compute the Expectation Value of \( S_y \)**:
   Since \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), the expectation value \( \langle S_y \rangle \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is:
\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

.

But wait, 3i multiplied by 4i is 12i² which is -12. And then -3*4 is -12. So total is (-12) + (-12) = -24. Therefore, ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24.

But wait, let me verify again:

⟨ψ| is [-3i, 4], and σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute the product more carefully:

The first entry of the row vector times the columns of σ_y.

First column contribution: [-3i] * 0 (from first row, first column) + [4] * i (from second row, first column) → 0 + 4i, so that gives 4i.

Second column contribution: [-3i] * (-i) (from first row, second column) + [4] * 0 (from second row, second column) → (3i^2) + 0 → -3 (since i^2 is -1).

Thus, ⟨ψ| σ_y = [4i, -3].

Now multiplying that result by |ψ⟩, which is (3i; 4).

So:

4i * 3i = 12i² = 12 * (-1) = -12,

and -3 * 4 = -12,

Summing these gives -12 -12 = -24. Therefore, ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24.

Then, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * ⟨σ_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12ħ. Wait, but that can't be right. Because the spin state (3i,4) may not be normalized.

Hold on, I realize that! All quantum states must be normalized, i.e., ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1. Let me check the norm of the vector (3i,4):

⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = -9i² + 16 = -9*(-1) +16 = 9 +16=25. So the norm is 25, so the normalized state vector would be (3i,4)/5.

That’s crucial! The original problem just says the spin state is (3i, 4), but in reality, expectation values are calculated with normalized states. If the state isn't normalized, we need to account for it by dividing by the norm.

So the actual normalized state |ψ〉 is (3i,4)/5.

Therefore, I should redo my previous calculation with the normalized state, because the expectation value formula requires the state to be normalized. My initial mistake was not normalizing the state, leading to ⟨σ_y⟩ being -24, but actually, with normalization, the result will be different.

Let’s recalculate everything properly. The normalized state is |ψ〉 = (3i,4)/5, so the corresponding bra ⟨ψ| is (-3i,4)/5.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| (ħ/2 σ_y) |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩.

First compute ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩.

The matrix multiplication now requires that the bra is [ -3i , 4 ] divided by 5, multiplied by σ_y, then by the ket [3i; 4 ] divided by 5.

So proceeding,

⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ = ( [ -3i  4 ] / 5 ) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * ( [3i ; 4 ] /5 )

Which can be factored into (1/5)(1/5) times [ -3i  4 ] * σ_y * [3i ;4 ]

We already calculated [ -3i  4 ] * σ_y earlier, resulting in [4i, -3], and then multiplied by [3i;4 ] giving -24.

Thus, ⟨ψ|σ_y|ψ⟩ is (1/25)(-24) = -24/25.

So then, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = (-12ħ)/25.

But let's go through the whole process again step by step to confirm.

First, normalized state |ψ⟩:

Original vector is a = 3i, b=4. The norm squared is |a|² + |b|² = |3i|² + |4|² = 9 +16=25. So √25=5. Thus, normalized components:

a/5 = (3i)/5,

b/5 = 4/5.

Hence, normalized |ψ⟩ is [ (3i)/5 ; 4/5 ]

Consequently, ⟨ψ| is [ ( -3i )/5 , 4/5 ]

Now compute ⟨ψ|σ_y:

Multiplying ⟨ψ| by the Pauli matrix σ_y:

First element (this is the first component of the resulting row vector):

( -3i/5 )*0 + (4/5)*i = 0 + 4i/5.

Second element:

( -3i/5 )*( -i ) + (4/5)*0 = (3i²)/5 + 0 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5.

So, the row vector after ⟨ψ|σ_y is [4i/5, -3/5].

Now, multiplying by the ket |ψ⟩:

[4i/5, -3/5] * [ (3i)/5 ; 4/5 ]

Calculating first term: (4i/5)*(3i/5) = 12i²/25 = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (-3/5)*(4/5) = -12/25.

Therefore, total = (-12/25) + (-12/25) = -24/25. Hence, ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24/25.

Thus, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * ⟨σ_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-12/25)*ħ. But since the spin of an electron is ½ ħ ? Wait, but more accurately, since the Pauli matrices are multiplied by ħ/2, the spin components are S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, so the expectation ⟨S_y⟩ would be (ħ/2)*⟨σ_y⟩.

Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*( -24/25 ) = (-12ħ)/25.

But let's confirm whether ħ is h-bar here. Yes, the standard notation is that the spin operators are given by S_i = (ħ/2)σ_i for i = x, y, z. So yes.

So, after careful calculation, ⟨S_y⟩ would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation of σ_y, which is indeed (-12/25)*ħ. Therefore, the final answer would be -12ħ/25.

Wait, but in terms of units, sometimes expectation values are given in terms of ħ/2 so maybe -12/25 times (ħ/2), but hold on, no:

Wait, S_y is defined as (ħ/2)σ_y. So when you write ⟨S_y⟩, you take ⟨ψ| (ħ/2 * σ_y) |ψ⟩, which equals (ħ/2) times ⟨σ_y⟩. Thus:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24/25)*(ħ/2) = -12/25 * ħ.

Wait, hang on. Back to arithmetic:

So (-24/25) multiplied by (ħ/2) is (-24/25)*(ħ/2) = (-12/25)ħ.

But let me check: (24 / 2) is 12, so indeed (24/25)*(1/2) is 12/25. So with the negative sign, it's -12/25 ħ.

Therefore, the expectation value of S_y is -12ħ/25.

But let's ensure that all steps are correct.

First, normalized state is correctly computed: the original state is (3i,4), squared norm is 9 +16 = 25, so divide by 5. The computation of multiplying ⟨ψ|σ_y and then by |ψ⟩ gives -24/25, resulting in ⟨S_y⟩ as (ħ/2)*(-24/25) simplifies to (-12/25)ħ.

Therefore, the final answer should be -12ħ/25. But I need to check units or possible convention. However, spin is given in units of ħ, so S_y is measured in terms of ħ. Therefore, this answer would correctly have units of ħ. Since in some contexts ħ is written as hbar, but the problem states to present ‘expectation value of S_y’ in the natural units. Typically it's expressed as a multiple of h-bar/2. But regardless, the mathematical answer is (-12/25) ħ. Alternatively expressed as -6/25 * 2*(ħ/2) ?? Wait, maybe double-check that.

Wait no. Since the operator S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) * ⟨σ_y⟩. We found ⟨σ_y⟩ to be -24/25. Correct.

So:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24/50) ħ = (-12/25) ħ. So both forms are acceptable. As -12/25 times ħ is equivalent to -24/50 - but we'll simplify fractions. So -12/25 ħ is simplest.

But maybe the question assumes ħ = 1. Let me check the original question again.

The problem says "find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y. Note: σ_y is given." So presumably, given the matrix for σ_y as [[0, -i],[i,0]], and since S_y is usually (ħ/2)σ_y. Unless otherwise stated, the problem might be referring to natural units where ħ is set to 1, so the spin operator would be σ_y/2. Hmm. Wait, if in the problem statement σ_y is given as the matrix, and perhaps their S_y is equal to σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Since standardly, S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y. However, if they don't mention units, perhaps they want the answer in terms of ħ. But the problem would have to specify. Wait, let me check the problem statement again.

"An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.

Note: σ_y (in latex format) is: [[0, -i],[i,0]]".

Hmm. The problem gives σ_y, so perhaps we need to write the answer in terms of σ_y's expectation value multiplied by ħ/2.

But since no mention of units, probably it needs to use ħ, so when calculating, must keep the ħ in the answer.

Thus, according to our calculation, it's -12ħ/25.

I think that is the answer. Let me make sure there's no mistake in calculation. Suppose the normalized state is (3i,4)/5. So when you do ⟨ S_y ⟩ it's (ħ/2) times the expectation of σ_y. Calculating ⟨ σ_y ⟩ step by step again.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute eigenvalues and such, but probably simpler using the standard expectation value formula. But perhaps there's a different way of doing it?

Wait. Let me check if perhaps we need to normalize the original spinor first. Did we do that correctly?

Yes, original state χ = (3i, 4). The norm squared is (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = 9 +16=25. Hence, normalizing, becomes 1/5*(3i,4).

Compute σ_y matrix:

[0, -i

i, 0]

So,

Compute:

[(1/5)(-3i), (1/5)(4)] * σ_y * [ (1/5)3i, (1/5)4 ]^T ?

Wait, or perhaps compute ψ† σ_y ψ, where ψ is the normalized column vector. Then multiply by ħ/2.

So ψ = (3i,4)^T;// without normalization, then normalized is (3i,4)/5.

So ψ†σ_yψ, non-normalized is [-3i,4] * [[0, -i],[i,0]] * [3i;4]

Wait, no, dimensionally ψ† is 1x2, σ_y is 2x2, ψ is 2x1. So multiplication is 1x1.

But non-normalized:

[-3i,4] * [[0, -i],[i,0]] * [3i;4]

Which equals [-3i,4] * [ (0*3i + (-i)*4 ), (i*3i + 0*4) ]

Wait, actually, first is:

First compute σ_y * ψ, which would be [[0, -i],[i, 0]] * [3i;4] = [0*(3i) + (-i)*4, i*(3i) + 0*4 ]^T.

Wait that's [ (-4i), (3i²) ]^T = [ -4i, -3 ]^T. Because i*3i is 3i² = -3.

Then, ψ† times that is ([-3i, 4]) multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ].

So that would be (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3).

= 12i² -12 = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24, as before. So denominator was after norm squared which is 25, so "divided by (5)(5)=25", hence ⟨σ_y⟩ =-24/25, as our initial calculation, leading to S_y being -(12/25)ħ. As previous.

Hence my conclusion is this value. Wait, but why can't this be, for instance, units of ħ/2? Let me check units again. Spin components are quantized in multiples of ħ/2. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, they give eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Therefore, eigenvalues of S_y are ±ħ/2. Hence, the expectation value must be between -ħ/2 and +ħ/2, because it's averaged.

But here we obtained -12ħ/25 which is about -0.48ħ. Which is more negative than -ħ/2 ≈ -0.5ħ? Wait, 12/25 is 0.48. 0.48 is less than 0.5, so it’s within the allowed range. So possible or so, so the answer is acceptable. Hence -12ħ/25 is okay. However, in natural units where ħ=1, the answer would just be -12/25. But the problem didn't specify, but since they provided σ_y in terms of i, but didn’t set ħ=1, the answer should be with ħ. So concludes that the expectation value is -12ħ/25.

Hence, the answer is \boxed{ -\dfrac{12}{25}\dfrac{\hbar}{2} }.

Wait, no. Wait, if S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, then so the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation of σ_y. If compute the expectation of σ_y as -24/25 then S_y: (ħ/2)(-24/25) = -12/25 * ħ. Alternatively maybe the question would just require the answer in terms of ħ/2 and so otherwise, but when I present the answer, need to check conventions. Alternatively, the answer can be represented in terms of (ħ/2) * (-24/25) =-24ħ/50 =-12 ħ/25. Yes, if I do (-24/25)* (ħ / 2 ), this is correct. So with simplification: -12/25 times ħ. So the correct answer is -12ħ/25. But, just checking with another example:

For example, If a state was (1,0), then σ_z would be [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The expectation of sigma_z would be 1. Then, expectation value of S_z would be ħ/2*1=ħ/2.

Following that logic, our problem's expectation of σ_y is -24/25, so that times ħ/2, so answer is -24/25 * ħ/2 = -12ħ/25.

Alternatively, some sources might write the expectation value without inverting numbers. For example, in some references, maybe not. But according to the standard relation, if S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, so yes, the answer should include the factor of ħ/2 multiplied by the expectation value of sigma_y.

But to be precise, since the problem asks for "the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.", which is an observable in terms of angular momentum units, which would be ħ, but I think according to how the problem is phrased, it's correct to have factors of ħ.

As an electron’s spin is opposite, that can and often does involve fractions of ħ. For example, the standard spin-up and spin-down are ±ħ/2. Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ here being -12ħ/25 is reasonable because -12/25 is about -0.48, slightly less than half a unit of ħ. So it's within the possible range.

Alternatively, another approach. The spin state can be written as |ψ> = a|+> + b|->, and then expectation values...

Wait, perhaps another method. The general expectation value of S_y can be expressed in terms of the components. For a spinor χ = [α, β]^T, normalized so that |α|² + |β|² =1, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2)(i(α β* - α* β)). Wait where does that come from? Let me check.

Since σ_y is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. So the expectation value is [α*, β*] * [[0, -i],[i,0]] * [α; β]. Which is:

(α*)(0)(α) + (α*)(-i)(β) + (β*)(i)(α) + (beta^*)(0)(beta) which simplifies to (-i α* beta + i beta* alpha)=i( β^* alpha - alpha^* beta )

Therefore, ⟨σ_y⟩ = i( β^* alpha - alpha^* beta )

In our case, the original spinor is (3i,4). So normalized it's (3i/5, 4/5). Thus, alpha=3i/5, beta=4/5. So:

β^* alpha = (4/5)*(3i/5) = 12i/25

alpha^* beta = (-3i/5)*(4/5) = -12i/25

Thus,

i( beta^* alpha - alpha^* beta ) = i( 12i/25 - (-12i/25) ) = i( 24i/25 )= 24i² /25 = -24/25.

Which matches our previous result for ⟨σ_y⟩. Then ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) times that, which is -24/25*(ħ/2)=-12ħ/25.

Thus, confirming that yes, the answer is -12ħ/25.

Therefore, thinking that the final answer is \boxed{ -\dfrac{12}{25} \dfrac{\hbar}{2} } can be an equivocation. Because usually S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, so if such answer format is expected, nothing wrong. But mathematically, -12ħ/25 is equivalent. It's a matter of notation.

Wait, let me check:

If you write -12/25 (ħ/2), it would be -6/25 ħ. But according to our previous numeric value, that would be different? Wait, no. Wait, no wait, 12/25*(ħ/2) is equal to 6ħ/25. But in our result, we have -24/25 multiplied by (ħ/2) which is -12ħ/25. But where does the claim link to the previous coefficients?

Wait, the matrix multiplication yields ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24/25. Then, S_y = (ħ/2)*σ_y, so the expectation is (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-24/ (25*2))ħ = -12/25 * ħ. Wait that’s correct, that would be - (12/25) ħ.

Alternatively, (-24/25)*(ħ/2) is the same as (-12/25) ħ. Hence, both are the same.

So to avoid confusion, the answer should be written as -\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar or more accurately, in a spin system where operators are proportional to (ħ/2), as perhaps stated. Alternatively, if expressed as (ħ/2)* expectation of σ_y, which is -24/25, then \langle S_y \rangle = -\dfrac{24}{50} \hbar= -\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar. Either way. However, it's important to reconcile this with natural units.

But considering all the steps, and the note in the problem that provides σ_y matrix so that S_y is calculated via that, but the question asks for the expectation value of S_y, so the answer should likely include the factor of ħ/2. Hence, the answer is:

⟨ S_y ⟩=（ħ/2）*( -24/25 )= -12ħ/25.

Thus, boxed answer would be \boxed{ -\dfrac{12}{25} \dfrac{\hbar}2}.

Alternatively, if written in terms of involving the unit hbar/2, could also write as -24/50 hbar, but simplifying that gives -12╱25 ⎄ as simplified fraction, but depends on the problem's notation.

But since the spin matrices are defined with σ_y and corresponding spin components as (ħ/2)σ_y, then the answer as calculated is -12ħ/25. Prefer to present it as –(12/25)ħ, simplifying units directly.

Given possible notations, both -12ħ/25 and – (12/25) ℏ/2 could refer to negative twelve twenty-fifths multiplied by ħ.Wait no, that’s a difference. Wait, because if S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y, then if we calculate the expectation value of S_y, is (ħ/2)*⟨σ_y⟩. So for ⟨sigma_y⟩:-24/25 then (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-24 ħ) / 50 = (-12 ħ)/25 ∴ where the expectation value is - twelve twenty-fifths times ħ.

Hence, whether originally integrating, correct answer is:

\boxed{-\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar}

Alternatively, I need to check relative normalization steps once again, but the key here is whether when the state is standardized. Original problem statement perhaps assumes the state is already normalized, but that's dangerous; computations however show that the state wasn't normalized, which we considered by dividing by 5. So proceedig properly yielded -12ħ/25.

Given that, putting it as \boxed{ -\dfrac{12}{25} \dfrac{\hbar}{2} } （if (⟨ σ_y ⟩ = -24/25) thus (ħ/2) * (-24/25) is ~") is this possible, but why 48? No. Wait 24/25 * (ħ/2) = 24/50 ħ= 12/25 ħ, but in negative, so -24/50= -12/25.) Wait, synapse.nah.

Wait this is a mess. Let's see:

⟨ S_y ⟩ = (ħ/2)⟨ σ_y ⟩

⟨ σ_y ⟩ = -24/25

Then, ⟨ S_y ⟩ is simply (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-24/(2*25)) ħ = (-12/25) ħ. Therefore,\boxed{ -\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar } 

Including the units in terms of hbar. So I think that's the correct way. Because (-24/25) is multiplied by ħ/2, so

(Original σ_y expect = -24/25, then multiplier is hbar /2, leading result in hbar * (-24/50), which is hbar * (-12/25)= -12/25 ħ

Yes exactly.

But the notation may vary. If σ_y is assigned without the ħ/2 factor, then when they asked for S_y they probably expect (hbar/2)*result. Hence, regardless, the numerical fraction would be -12/25.

But with the hbar included. As per calculation. 

Therefore, after due diligence, boxed answer is:


**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{12}{25} \dfrac{\hbar}{2}}

However, according to our calculation, (-24/25) * (ħ/2) is= -24/50 ħ = -12/25 ħ, but conventionally, when the spin operator is defined as S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, then -24/25 times (ħ/2) is indeed correct. But more accurately,

⟨ S_y ⟩= (ħ/2)*(-24/25). So closely:

⟨ S_y ⟩= -24/50 ħ = -12/25 ħ.

But in terms of correct LaTeX expression, boxed as

\boxed{ -\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar }

If we exactly multiply as per calculation steps, alternatively.


But other alternatives lead to confusion, when both normalization and multiplication are taken into account. Since I need to confirm whether in summation step, final answer is supporting this.

Summarizing:

 start with (3i, 4) which is not normalized. Normalization factor is 1/5. Hence, compute Σ = [⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ ] which equals -24/25. Then S_y = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = -12ħ/25. So according to this last step, that must be it, so spelled out in LaTeX as \boxed{ -\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar }, which is simpler. But perhaps one must check:

Alternatively, else, in the original QM calculation, for expectation value when not normalized, ⟨ A ⟩ = (⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩)/(⟨ψ|ψ⟩). So suppose I proceed in another way:

Unnormalized |ψ〉 =3i|↑_z> +4 |↓_z> which has squared norm 3i(-3i)+4x4=9 +16=25. Thus <S_y> = (⟨ψ | S_y | ψ ⟩)/⟨ψ |ψ⟩. So numerator would be [Compute ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ ⟩ which is ( [-3i 4] * (ħ/2) * σ_y) * [3i;4 ] ). Which gives denominator 25, thus numerator (ħ/2)*(-24) as before → (-24ħ/2)/25=-12ħ)/25. Thus same result, so ⟨S_y⟩= -12ħ/25.

Hence, the answer is indeed -12h/25, each common step converged to same result. Therefore, confident with this answer. So it's purely \boxed{ -\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar }

But when the operator S_y is inherently associated with ħ/2 multiplier., is this answer okay? Yes because, you compute it correctly, irrespective of the operator. Remembering students commonly abuse processes here, but in this particular case, the result of -12/25 ħ is correct.


**Final Answer**
\boxed{-\dfrac{12}{25} \hbar}

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction \( S_y \) for an electron in the spin state \( (3i, 4) \), we follow these steps:

1. **Normalize the spin state**:
   The given spin state is \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). The norm of this state is calculated as:
   \[
   \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
   \]
   The normalized state is:
   \[
   | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Compute the conjugate transpose (bra vector)**:
   The bra vector \( \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | \) corresponding to the normalized ket vector is:
   \[
   \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}
   \]

3. **Use the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \)**:
   The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) is:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

4. **Calculate \( \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | \sigma_y | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \)**:
   First, multiply \( \langle \psi_{\text{norm}} | \) with \( \sigma_y \):
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4i}{5} & -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   Next, multiply this result with \( | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \):
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} \frac{4i}{5} & -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \left( \frac{4i}{5} \cdot \frac{3i}{5} \right) + \left( -\frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \right)
   \]
   Calculate each term:
   \[
   \frac{4i}{5} \cdot \frac{3i}{5} = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{12(-1)}{25} = -\frac{12}{25}
   \]
   \[
   -\frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = -\frac{12}{25}
   \]
   Adding these terms gives:
   \[
   -\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = -\frac{24}{25}
   \]

5. **Multiply by \( \hbar/2 \)**:
   The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left( -\frac{24}{25} \right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \(\boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}\).

[4]

Let's compute each term:

First term: 4i *3i = 12i² = 12*(-1) = -12

Second term: -3*4 = -12

Therefore, total is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24.

But we need ⟨S_y⟩, which is (ħ/2) * ⟨σ_y⟩. Hence, (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12ħ.

Hold on, but wait a moment. The spin state might not be normalized. Spin states should be normalized, meaning that the sum of the squares of the magnitude of the components equals 1. In other words, ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 = 25. Hence, this state is not normalized. The expectation value calculation requires the state to be normalized; otherwise, the probabilities won't sum to 1.

So I made a mistake here. First, I need to normalize the state vector before calculating the expectation value. That part is essential. Therefore, the initial step should be to compute the normalization constant.

The vector given is |ψ⟩ = [3i; 4], and the norm is sqrt(|3i|² + |4|²) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. Hence, the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). That would be important for accurate calculation of the expectation value.

So that's a crucial step I missed. Therefore, let's correct this.

The normalized |ψ⟩ is [3i/5; 4/5], and the normalized ⟨ψ| is [-3i/5, 4/5]

Then, let's redo the calculation with the normalized vector.

Again, compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩.

First, compute ⟨ψ| σ_y:

Row vector [-3i/5, 4/5] multiplied by σ_y matrix:

[0   -i
i    0]

So first component:

(-3i/5)*0 + (4/5)*i = (0) + (4i/5) = 4i/5

Second component:

(-3i/5)*(-i) + (4/5)*0 = (3i²)/5 + 0 = 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5

Thus, ⟨ψ|σ_y becomes [4i/5, -3/5]

Now multiply by |ψ⟩:

(4i/5, -3/5) * [3i/5; 4/5]

Calculating each term:

First term: (4i/5)*(3i/5) = (12i²)/25 = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25

Second term: (-3/5)*(4/5) = -12/25

Adding both: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = -24/25

Hence, ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24/25

Then, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*⟨σ_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = -12ħ/25

But wait, here's another thing. In many physical contexts, the Pauli matrices are defined such that S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, which we considered here. So your answer will be in terms of ħ. So unless the numerical value of ħ is given, the answer would be –12ħ/25.

But in some courses, they may set ħ = 1, but unless stated, need to include ħ. Since the problem says to find S_y, which has units of ħ, so the answer is –(12/25)(ħ/2). Wait – No:

Wait, S_y operator is (ħ/2) σ_y, not ħ times σ_y. Hence, to compute ⟨S_y⟩:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨σ_y⟩

But we found ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24/25

Thus:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = -12ħ/25

So substitute ħ as ℏ (in case typographical), then outputting as well: \-12 \hbar /25. But typically, fractions like this are written by reducing numerator and denominator, but 12 and 25 are coprime, so that's the simplest form. Therefore, boxed: \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.

But let's ensure my arithmetic is correct. Let me recast all steps again.

Initial state not normalized. Attained:

Original |ψ⟩ = [3i,4]^T. Norm: sqrt((3i)(-3i) + 16) =sqrt(9 +16)=sqrt(25)=5. Thus, normalized |ψ_n⟩ = (3i/5,4/5)^T.

Compute ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ_n | S_y | ψ_n⟩. Now, S_y= (ħ/2)σ_y.

Thus:

⟨Sy⟩ = (ħ/2) * ⟨ψ_n | σ_y | ψ_n⟩

Calculating ⟨ψ_n | σ_y | ψ_n⟩:

⟨ψ_n| = [ -3i/5 , 4/5 ]

Multiplying by σ_y: [0, -i; i, 0]

Thus:

First element after multiplying: (-3i/5)(0) + (4/5)(i) = 4i/5

Second element: (-3i/5)(-i) + (4/5)(0) = 3i² /5 = 3(-1)/5 = -3/5

So [4i/5 , -3/5]

When we multiply this with |ψ_n⟩:

(4i/5)(3i/5) + (-3/5)(4/5) = (12i²)/25 + (-12)/25 = (12*(-1) -12)/25 = (-12 -12)/25 = -24/25

Multiply by ħ/2:

(ħ/2)*(-24/25)= -12ħ/25

Yes, this is correct. Therefore, the expectation value is –12ħ/25.

So expressed is boxed as \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.

An alternative way of thinking would include verifying through another method.

Alternatively, the expectation value of an operator can be calculated in different coordinate systems or using Eigen states, but with spin-1/2 systems, matrix multiplication is straightforward.

Alternatively, remember for spin-1/2 systems, the expectation is simply the product of bra, operator, and ket as above. So the conclusion here is likely correct.

**Final Answer**
The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.
