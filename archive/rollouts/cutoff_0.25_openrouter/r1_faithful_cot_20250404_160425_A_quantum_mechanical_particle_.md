The problem involves finding the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle moving in two dimensions under the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \).

1. **Convert the Potential to Cartesian Coordinates**:
   - The potential in polar coordinates is given by \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 [1 + 3 \cos^2(\theta)] \).
   - Converting to Cartesian coordinates using \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r} \), the potential becomes:
     \[
     V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2} k x^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2
     \]

2. **Identify the Anisotropic Harmonic Oscillator**:
   - The potential is recognized as an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions.
   - The effective spring constants are \( K_x = 4k \) and \( K_y = k \), leading to angular frequencies \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \) and \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

3. **Calculate the Energy Levels**:
   - The energy levels of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator are the sum of the energies from each direction:
     \[
     E = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Substituting the frequencies \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \):
     \[
     E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \right]
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression gives:
     \[
     E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)
     \]

### Final Answer
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.

Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here where a particle of mass m moves in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The task is to find the energy spectrum. Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding the setup.

First, since the potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ), it's natural to work in polar coordinates. The potential has a radial part, (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential, and an angular part, (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Combining these, the total potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, but does that make sense? Let me check: 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ. If I factor out 1/2 kr², then it's 1 + 3 cos²θ. Okay, that seems correct.

So the potential depends on both r and θ, which suggests that the Schrödinger equation might not be separable into radial and angular parts. Hmm, but let me think. Maybe I can manipulate it to make it separable. If that's possible, then we can solve the angular part and radial part separately, which is the standard approach.

Another thought: Perhaps the angular part can be simplified using some trigonometric identity. Let's look at 1 + 3 cos²θ. Remember that cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Plugging that in: 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ. So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ] = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Not sure if that helps, but maybe rewriting it in terms of cos2θ can be useful.

Alternatively, consider whether the angular part is similar to a term that arises in spherical coordinates (even though this is 2D) with some angular dependence. Since we are dealing with polar coordinates in 2D, the angular part of the Laplacian would involve derivatives with respect to θ, and the potential's θ dependence would couple into the angular equation.

Alternatively, think about coordinates. If the potential has a cos²θ term, maybe it's advantageous to perform a coordinate transformation or choose a different set of coordinates where this term becomes simpler. For instance, in 2D, if the potential has an angular dependence like cos²θ, perhaps we can switch to coordinates where this dependence is eliminated. However, I'm not sure exactly how. Alternatively, since cos²θ is related to the double angle, maybe expanding in terms of angular momentum eigenfunctions?

Wait, another approach: Since the potential has an r² multiplied by angular terms, maybe we can factor the potential into a radial term and an angular term. Let me see:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ].

So if we let V(r,θ) = f(r) * g(θ), where f(r) = (1/2)k r² and g(θ) = 1 + 3 cos²θ, but that doesn't look separable because both terms involve r² and angles. So the Hamiltonian is H = - (ħ²/(2m)) ∇² + V(r,θ). The problem is that the potential is not purely radial; it depends on θ as well, which complicates separation of variables.

But perhaps it can still be separated. Let's attempt to write the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates. In 2D polar coordinates, the Laplacian is ∇² = (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²). So the Hamiltonian becomes:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Let me assume a separable solution ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Φ(θ). Then substituting into Hψ = Eψ would give:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) Φ + (1/r²) R d²Φ/dθ² ] + (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] R Φ = E R Φ.

Dividing both sides by R Φ:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(r R))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² ] + (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = E.

To separate variables, we need the equation to be in a form where terms depend only on r or θ. Let's rearrange terms:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(r R))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) ] + (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] - (ħ²/(2m)) [1/(r² Φ) d²Φ/dθ²] = E.

Hmm, the issue is the term [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Because of the 1 and the 3 cos²θ, when multiplied by r², the terms mixing r and θ. So:

Left side:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(r R))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) ] - (ħ²/(2m)) [1/(r² Φ) d²Φ/dθ² ] + (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = E.

Multiply through by -2m/ħ²:

[ (1/(r R))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) ] + (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² - (2m/ħ²) [ - (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] + E ] = 0.

But even so, the presence of both r² and cos²θ in the potential makes the equation non-separable. Because, if we try to move the potential term to the other side:

Let's write:

[ (1/r) d/dr(r dR/dr) ]/ R - (2m/ħ²) [ (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] - E ] + (1/r²)(d²Φ/dθ²)/Φ = 0.

Looks like the terms involving θ and r are mixed because of the 1 + 3 cos²θ. Therefore, we can't separate this equation into pure radial and angular parts in a straightforward way. That complicates things.

But maybe there's a trick. Let's recall that for the 2D harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)mω² r². The energy levels are quantized as ħω(n_r + |m| + 1), where m is the angular momentum quantum number and n_r is the radial quantum number. However, in this case, the potential is not isotropic due to the angular dependence.

But perhaps we can model this potential as a combination of different harmonic oscillators. Let me think: If the potential was isotropic, V(r) = 1/2 k r², then the energy levels would be straightforward. However, here, we have an anisotropic potential: in Cartesian coordinates, perhaps?

Wait, the potential is given in polar coordinates, but if I convert it to Cartesian coordinates, maybe it becomes separable there. Let me try that. Since r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ = x²/r². Then:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x² / r²) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Simplifying, that becomes:

(1/2)kx² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2 + 3/2)k x² ) + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Ah! So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Which is just a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the x and y directions.

Wait, that's huge! So was my conversion correct?

Let me double-check:

Original V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

But r² = x² + y², cosθ = x / r. So cos²θ = x² / (x² + y²).

Therefore, V = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²)(x² / (x² + y²)) )

The second term simplifies to (3/2)k x². Thus,

V = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = [ (1/2 + 3/2)k x² ] + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh, that's right! So by converting to Cartesian coordinates, the potential simplifies to an anisotropic harmonic oscillator where the x-direction has a spring constant K_x = 4k (since for harmonic oscillator V = (1/2)K x², and here (1/2)K_x = 2k ⇒ K_x = 4k) and the y-direction has K_y = k (since (1/2)K_y = (1/2)k ⇒ K_y = k). Therefore, we have two different frequencies in x and y directions.

But in that case, the energy levels of a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator (with different frequencies in x and y) are simply the sum of the energies from each direction. Therefore, the total energy would be E = ħω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y (n_y + 1/2), where ω_x = sqrt(K_x/m) = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m), and ω_y = sqrt(K_y/m) = sqrt(k/m).

Therefore, substituting back in:

E = ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ * sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2 )

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Simplify:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Alternatively, express it as:

Let ω = sqrt(k/m). Then,

E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Wait, but usually, the harmonic oscillator energy is (n + 1/2) ħ ω for each degree of freedom. However, here we have different frequencies in x and y directions. Let me recheck that. The frequencies are ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m). Therefore, each direction contributes (n_x + 1/2)ħ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2)ħ ω_y. So that would be:

E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 ) = ħ (2 ω)(n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω(n_y + 1/2) )

Factor out ħ ω:

E = ħ ω [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] = ħ ω [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ ω [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

So yes, the total energy is quantized as E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).

Alternatively, if we want to write it in terms of the original variables, since ω = sqrt(k/m), E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). But to make it more elegant, we can note that in an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x and ω_y, the energy levels are E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2 ) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 ). In this case, substituting ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m), the expression matches.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ √(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But let's verify if my coordinate transformation was the correct step. Since the problem gave the potential in polar coordinates but when expressed in Cartesian coordinates, it turned out to be separable. Therefore, the solution in Cartesian coordinates is separable, implying that energy eigenstates can be written as products of x and y harmonic oscillator states.

Therefore, the standard result for the 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator applies here. So, indeed, the energy levels should be as above. Therefore, the answer is that the energy spectrum is E = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers.

Alternatively, if we want to write this in terms of a single quantum number, say N = 2n_x + n_y, but the spectrum would be degenerate depending on the combinations of n_x and n_y that yield the same N. However, in the problem statement, they just want the energy spectrum, so perhaps expressing it in terms of n_x and n_y is acceptable.

Wait, but traditionally in such problems, one might use different conventions. Let me just check again, if omega x is 2 sqrt(k/m) and omega y is sqrt(k/m). The energies in each direction:

In x-direction: Energy levels (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + 1) ħ sqrt(k/m)

In y-direction: Energy levels (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)

Therefore, adding both:

Total energy is (2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ) ħ sqrt(k/m) = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Yes, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the energy levels are:

E = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But the question is to find the energy spectrum. If I need to write it in terms of quantum numbers, perhaps writing E_{n_x, n_y} as above is good. However, maybe there's a way to relate this to polar coordinates quantum numbers. But since the problem naturally separates in Cartesian coordinates and not polar coordinates (because the potential in polar coordinates had θ dependence), but when converting to Cartesian coordinates, we found that it's an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Therefore, working in Cartesian coordinates is the way to go here.

Wait, so maybe the answer is right here. But I need to confirm whether in converting the potential I did everything correctly.

Original potential: V(r,θ)=1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ.

Converted to Cartesian:

1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 k x²

Yes, since r² = x² + y² and cosθ = x/sqrt(x² + y²). So indeed, when you square cosine theta and multiply by r² you get x². Therefore, the potential in Cartesian coordinates is 1/2 k(x² + y²) + 3/2 kx². Combine the terms:

1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y² + 3/2 kx² = (1/2 + 3/2)kx² + 1/2 k y² = 2kx² + (1/2)ky^2.

Therefore, we can model this as two independent harmonic oscillators in x and y directions, with the x-direction having a "spring constant" of 4k (since 2kx² = 1/2(4k)x²) and the y-direction having a "spring constant" of k (since (1/2)k y²).

Therefore, the frequencies are:

ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m)

ω_y = sqrt(k/m)

Therefore, these are the angular frequencies for the respective directions.

Then, energy in each direction is (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x and (n_y + 1/2)ħω_y.

So total energy is:

E = (n_x + 1/2)ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2)ħ sqrt(k/m)

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Expanding:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 )

Which simplifies to:

E = ħ sqrt(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Thus, the energy levels are as derived above, where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). Hence, this is the energy spectrum.

Alternatively, if I want, I can write it in terms of ω_x and ω_y. The frequencies are ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Then, E can also be expressed as E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 ). But both expressions are equivalent.

Conclusion: Because converting the potential from polar to Cartesian coordinates reveals that it's an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator, separable in x and y, the energy levels can be found by summing the contributions from each direction, leading to the spectrum E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) for non-negative integers n_x and n_y.

However, just to be thorough, let me check if there's another approach to this problem in case my initial assumption was wrong. For example, treating it in polar coordinates without conversion to Cartesian. But given that the potential ended up being non-separable in polar coordinates (as we saw initially) but separable in Cartesian coordinates, which simplifies the problem, I think the Cartesian approach is correct.

Alternatively, if we had to stay in polar coordinates, we can note that the potential has a cos²θ term. Such an angular dependence often relates to quadrupole terms or angular momentum coupling. In such cases, perhaps expanding the angular part in terms of spherical harmonics (well, in 2D, it's Fourier series). But in 2D, angular part of the wavefunction is e^{imθ} with integer m. However, the presence of cos²θ may lead to coupling between different m states. Because cos²θ can be written in terms of e^{i2θ} and e^{-i2θ} terms. So perhaps the angular equation becomes a matrix equation where the potential term couples m to m ± 2. Then the equation might not exactly separate, but if the system is still integrable, you might find solutions via angular momentum eigenstates expansion.

But given that converting to Cartesian coordinates immediately simplifies the problem, that's probably the smarter way to tackle it because we can exploit separability.

Thus, final answer: The energy spectrum is given by E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.

Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here where a particle of mass m moves in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The task is to find the energy spectrum. Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding the setup.

First, since the potential is given in polar coordinates (r, θ), it's natural to work in polar coordinates. The potential has a radial part, (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential, and an angular part, (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Combining these, the total potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, but does that make sense? Let me check: 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ. If I factor out 1/2 kr², then it's 1 + 3 cos²θ. Okay, that seems correct.

So the potential depends on both r and θ, which suggests that the Schrödinger equation might not be separable into radial and angular parts. Hmm, but let me think. Maybe I can manipulate it to make it separable. If that's possible, then we can solve the angular part and radial part separately, which is the standard approach.

Another thought: Perhaps the angular part can be simplified using some trigonometric identity. Let's look at 1 + 3 cos²θ. Remember that cos²θ can be written as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Plugging that in: 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ. So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ] = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Not sure if that helps, but maybe rewriting it in terms of cos2θ can be useful.

Alternatively, consider whether the angular part is similar to a term that arises in spherical coordinates (even though this is 2D) with some angular dependence. Since we are dealing with polar coordinates in 2D, the angular part of the Laplacian would involve derivatives with respect to θ, and the potential's θ dependence would couple into the angular equation.

Alternatively, think about coordinates. If the potential has a cos²θ term, maybe it's advantageous to perform a coordinate transformation or choose a different set of coordinates where this term becomes simpler. For instance, in 2D, if the potential has an angular dependence like cos²θ, perhaps we can switch to coordinates where this dependence is eliminated. However, I'm not sure exactly how. Alternatively, since cos²θ is related to the double angle, maybe expanding in terms of angular momentum eigenfunctions?

Wait, another approach: Since the potential has an r² multiplied by angular terms, maybe we can factor the potential into a radial term and an angular term. Let me see:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ].

So if we let V(r,θ) = f(r) * g(θ), where f(r) = (1/2)k r² and g(θ) = 1 + 3 cos²θ, but that doesn't look separable because both terms involve r² and angles. So the Hamiltonian is H = - (ħ²/(2m)) ∇² + V(r,θ). The problem is that the potential is not purely radial; it depends on θ as well, which complicates separation of variables.

But perhaps it can still be separated. Let's attempt to write the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates. In 2D polar coordinates, the Laplacian is ∇² = (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²). So the Hamiltonian becomes:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Let me assume a separable solution ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Φ(θ). Then substituting into Hψ = Eψ would give:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) Φ + (1/r²) R d²Φ/dθ² ] + (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] R Φ = E R Φ.

Dividing both sides by R Φ:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(r R))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² ] + (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = E.

To separate variables, we need the eq

I've got this quantum mechanics problem involving a particle with mass m moving in two dimensions with a potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ, and I need to determine the energy spectrum. Let me analyze this situation.

Since the potential is expressed in polar coordinates (r, θ), it makes sense to use these coordinates for our approach. Looking at the potential, I notice it consists of a radial component, (1/2)kr², resembling a harmonic oscillator potential, and an angular component, (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Combined, the potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. I should verify this: (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Factoring out (1/2)kr², we get [1 + 3 cos²θ], which confirms my expression.

Since the potential depends on both r and θ, the Schrödinger equation might not be separable into individual radial and angular components. However, I should explore if manipulation could make it separable, allowing me to solve each part independently as is typically done.

Perhaps simplifying the angular component using trigonometric identities would help. Considering that cos²θ equals (1 + cos2θ)/2, substituting this gives: 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ. Therefore, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ] = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. While this rewriting in terms of cos2θ might not immediately solve our problem, it could prove useful.

Another approach is to consider whether the angular component resembles terms from spherical coordinates, despite being in two dimensions. In 2D polar coordinates, the angular part of the Laplacian involves derivatives with respect to θ, and the potential's θ dependence would interact with the angular equation.

I could also explore a coordinate transformation to simplify the cos²θ term. In two dimensions, a different coordinate system might eliminate this angular dependence, though I'm unsure of the specific transformation. Alternatively, since cos²θ relates to the double angle, perhaps expanding in terms of angular momentum eigenfunctions would be beneficial.

Let's try factoring the potential: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. If we set V(r,θ) = f(r) * g(θ), where f(r) = (1/2)kr² and g(θ) = 1 + 3 cos²θ, the problem is that both terms involve r² and angles, which complicates separation.

The Hamiltonian is H = -(ħ²/(2m))∇² + V(r,θ). The challenge lies in the potential not being purely radial; its θ dependence complicates the separation of variables.

Let's write the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates. In 2D polar coordinates, the Laplacian is ∇² = (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²). Thus, the Hamiltonian becomes:

H = -(ħ²/(2m))[(1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²)] + (1/2)kr²[1 + 3 cos²θ].

Assuming a separable solution ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Φ(θ) and substituting into Hψ = Eψ:

-(ħ²/(2m))[(1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr)Φ + (1/r²)R d²Φ/dθ²] + (1/2)kr²[1 + 3 cos²θ]RΦ = ERΦ

Sure, here's the paraphrased text:

Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem involving a particle of mass m moving in two dimensions with a potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The goal is to determine the energy spectrum. Let's start by analyzing the situation.

Given that the potential is expressed in polar coordinates (r, θ), it's logical to work within this coordinate system. The potential includes a radial component, (1/2)kr², resembling that of a harmonic oscillator, along with an angular component, (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Combining these, we obtain V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Let me verify this calculation: 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ. By factoring out 1/2 kr², we indeed get 1 + 3 cos²θ. That seems correct.

Since the potential depends on both r and θ, it implies that the Schrödinger equation might not separate into distinct radial and angular parts. However, let me think about it. There might be a way to rearrange it for separation. If that’s feasible, we could solve the radial and angular parts separately, which is a common strategy.

Maybe the angular part can be simplified using a trigonometric identity. For example, cos²θ can be rewritten as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Substituting this gives: 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ. Therefore, the potential changes to V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ] = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ. Although it's not yet clear how useful this transformation is, rewriting it with cos2θ might be handy.

Alternatively, could the angular part resemble terms that appear in spherical coordinates, even in 2D, due to some angular dependency? Since we are working with polar coordinates in 2D, the angular part of the Laplacian would involve derivatives with respect to θ, and the potential’s θ dependence would interact with the angular equation.

Or think about a change of coordinates. Given that there's a cos²θ term, perhaps switching to a coordinate system where this term becomes simpler would be beneficial. In 2D, with an angular dependence like cos²θ, maybe there's a transformation that simplifies it, though I'm not certain how. Alternatively, since cos²θ relates to the double angle, expansions using angular momentum eigenfunctions could be considered.

Another potential approach: Since the angular terms multiply r² in the potential, it may be possible to express the potential as a product of a radial and an angular term. Let's examine this:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ].

If we define V(r,θ) as f(r) * g(θ), where f(r) = (1/2)k r² and g(θ) = 1 + 3 cos²θ, it turns out to be inseparable due to both terms involving r² and angular components. Thus, the Hamiltonian is H = - (ħ²/(2m)) ∇² + V(r,θ). The challenge arises since the potential isn't purely radial; it also depends on θ, making separation of variables difficult.

However, separation might still be achievable. Let's try writing the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates. In 2D polar coordinates, the Laplacian is ∇² = (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²). Thus, the Hamiltonian becomes:

H = - (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²) ] + (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Assume a separable solution ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Φ(θ). Substituting this into Hψ = Eψ will yield:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) Φ + (1/r²) R d²Φ/dθ² ] + (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] R Φ = E R Φ.

Dividing both sides by R Φ:

- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/(r R))(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² ] + (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = E.

To achieve separation of variables, we need the equation to...

Therefore, it's not possible to directly separate variables here because the angular part of the potential multiplies r².\n\nHmm. Wait, but perhaps if we factor out 1/r²? Let's see.

Let me try substitution ψ(r,θ) = R(r)Φ(θ):\n\nThen:\n\n(1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) Φ + (1/r²) R d²Φ/dθ² - (m k / ħ²) r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] R Φ + (2m E / ħ²) R Φ = 0.\n\nDivide through by R Φ:\n\n[ (1/r R)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) ] + [ (1/r² Φ)(d²Φ/dθ²) ] - (m k / ħ²) r² [1 + 3 cos²θ ] + (2m E / ħ²) = 0.\n\nNow, let's rearrange:\n\n([1/(r R) d/dr (r dR/dr)] - (m k / ħ²) r² + (2m E / ħ²)) + [1/(r² Φ) d² Φ/dθ² - (m k / ħ²) r² (3 cos²θ) ] = 0.\n\nBut this still couples r and θ through the terms involving r² (3 cos²θ). Unless that term can somehow be combined with the angular derivative term... Let me see.\n\nSuppose we move the angle-dependent term to the angular part. So:\n\nThe equation should equal zero. For separation of variables, we need terms depending only on r and terms depending only on θ to sum to a constant. Let's see:\n\nLet me try grouping as follows:\n\nGroup the radial terms and the constant terms, and the angular terms:\n\nTerms with R:\n\n(1/(r R) d/dr ( r dR/dr )) - (m k / ħ² r² ) [ (1 + 3 cos²θ ) r^4 / r² ? Wait, no. Wait, hold on.)\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up. The potential term is proportional to r² [1 + 3 cos²θ], which would be expanded as (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ, and that term, when plugged into the equation, already has r² in both cases.\n\nBut when trying to separate variables, if the potential had only radial dependence, then it would work. However, here the potential has angular dependence multiplied by r², so both radial and angular parts would have terms mixed with r² and angles. Therefore, it's a problem. Hmm.\n\nMaybe another approach, for potentials that are quadratic in r and have a angular dependence. In such cases, perhaps we can transform the coordinates. For example, stretch or compress the coordinates in different angular directions.\n\nWait, in 2D, let's think about coordinates. Suppose we go from polar coordinates to another coordinate system. Let me think... since the potential is of the form 1/2 kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ ). Let me compute what that potential is in Cartesian coordinates. Since x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so cosθ = x / r, so cos²θ = x² / r². Then:\n\nV(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = (1/2)k (x² + y²) [1 + 3 x² / (x² + y²)] = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².\n\nSimplifying: V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 + 3/2) k x² + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! Wait a second. That seems like a significant simplification. That's V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So in Cartesian coordinates, this potential is a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator!\n\nHah! That makes much more sense. So by converting to Cartesian coordinates, we can see that the potential is actually separable into x and y components, each with different spring constants. So the original potential in polar coordinates maybe looked more complicated, but in Cartesian it's simply two independent harmonic oscillators with different frequencies. Thus, the energy spectrum can be found by combining the quantized energies from the x and y directions.\n\nWow, okay. So the crux was realizing that converting to Cartesian coordinates simplifies the potential. Let me just verify this calculation again. Starting with V(r,θ)= (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. In Cartesian coordinates, r² = x² + y², cosθ = x / r. Therefore:\n\nV = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k(x² + y²)(x²)/(x² + y²) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 + 3/2) k x² + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, yes, it's an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y.\n\nTherefore, the Schrödinger equation becomes:\n\nH = p_x²/(2m) + p_y²/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².\n\nBut the usual form is H = p_x²/(2m) + (1/2) m ω_x² x² + p_y²/(2m) + (1/2) m ω_y² y². Therefore, comparing:\n\nFor the x-component: (1/2) m ω_x² x² = 2k x² ⇒ ω_x = sqrt(4k / m).\n\nSimilarly, for the y-component: (1/2) m ω_y² y² = (1/2)k y² ⇒ ω_y = sqrt(k / m).\n\nTherefore, the Hamiltonian is H = ħ ω_x (a_x† a_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (a_y† a_y + 1/2).\n\nSince in the x-direction we have ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) (since 4k/m ⇒ sqrt(4k/m)), and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Then the energy levels are given by:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) = 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)].\n\nSimplify that expression:\n\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2].\n\nAlternatively, factoring out 1/2:\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\n2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) = 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum is:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2], where ω = sqrt(k/m). Wait, but is ω sqrt(k/m)?\n\nWait no.\n\nWait, ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). And ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So ħ ω_x = ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m), and ħ ω_y = ħ sqrt(k/m). It's almost that. So:\n\nExpressing in terms of ω_x and ω_y:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = (2 ħ sqrt(k/m)) (n_x + 1/2) + ( ħ sqrt(k/m) ) (n_y + 1/2 ) = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2 ) + (n_y + 1/2 ) ].\n\nThus:\n\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ sqrt(k/m) ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ).\n\nAlternatively, factor sqrt(k/m):\n\nFrequency terms are ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). It might be cleaner to write the energies in terms of these frequencies:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2).\n\nBut since ω_x = 2 ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m), and ω_y = ω.\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = 2 ħ ω (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω (n_y + 1/2) = ħ ω [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ].\n\nRegardless of notation, the key is that the x and y components of the oscillator have different frequencies, leading to contributions to the energy that are linear combinations of the quantum numbers n_x and n_y multiplied by their respective frequencies.\n\nBut wait, actually, for a standard two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in each direction, the energy would indeed be E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2). So the answer would directly be that? So in this problem, since ω_x is 2√(k/m) and ω_y is √(k/m), we can write the energy as:\n\nE = ħ√(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]\n\nAlternatively, combining terms:\n\nE = ħ√(k/m) ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nBut is there a better way to express this? Since √(k/m) is the base frequency.\n\nYes, so perhaps write it in terms of ω = √(k/m), leading to E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). Alternatively, noting that combining the different contributions, but not sure. Let me cross-check. Alternatively, is there an alternative coordinate system where this problem can be re-expressed, but given that we've already transformed to Cartesian coordinates, which makes it separable, the answer should be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to verify dimensions. The energy should have unit of ħ times frequency. The term (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) is dimensionless. And with ω being √(k/m), which has unit 1/s. So ħ ω is energy, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the energy levels are quantized as E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where n_x, n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).\n\nAlternatively, factor 3/2 as 1.5 or 3/2. Either way, but we can also write it with the constants:\n\nE_{n_x,n_y} = 2 ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) but since ω_x = 2 ω and ω_y = ω, substituting back:\n\n= 2*(ħ*2ω)*(n_x + 1/2) + ħ*ω*(n_y +1/2) ⟹ but that seems inconsistent. Wait no, it's E = ħ ω_x (n_x +1/2 ) + ħ ω_y (n_y +1/2 ). Which is, substituting ω_x = 2 ω, ω_y = ω:\n\nE = ħ (2ω) (n_x +1/2 ) + ħ ω (n_y + 1/2 ) = ħ ω [ 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ ω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ].\n\nSame answer as above. Therefore, whether telescoped through Cartesian coordinates potential or that the energy levels are additive in n_x and n_y.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the energy spectrum is given by:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ √(k/m) ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nWhere n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...).\n\nHence, we can report this as the energy spectrum.\n\nAlternatively, another user might express it using different notation, perhaps replacing √(k/m) with ω. If we define ω = √(k/m), which is the standard frequency for a harmonic oscillator with spring constant k, then E_{n_x, n_y} is as above. So yes. Summarizing:\n\nThe given potential does map to an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator when converted to Cartesian coordinates, thereby allowing the problem to be separable. Since in Cartesian coordinates the potential is quadratic in x and y but with different force constants (resulting in different frequencies in x and y directions), the total energy becomes the sum of the individual oscillator energies. Therefore, the energy eigenvalues are E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where ω = √(k/m).\n\nSo plugging in that expression. It's lower energy when both n_x and n_y are 0. However, depending on the formula, that would be E = (0 + 0 + 3/2) ħ ω, which is (3/2)ħ ω. But I need to make sure whether that matches with harmonic oscillator potential in different directions. For instance, if each direction's ground state energy is (1/2) ħ ω_i. The x-direction has (1/2) ħ ω_x = (1/2) ħ * 2 ω = ħ ω. The y-direction has (1/2) ħ ω. Therefore, total ground state energy is ħ ω + (1/2) ħ ω = (3/2) ħ ω. So yes, exactly. Then, the first term in the sum with 2n_x + n_y.\n\nTherefore, each excitation in the x-direction raises the energy by 2ħ ω, and each in the y-direction by 1ħ ω. So, different quantum numbers contribute differently, so the energy is a function that allows for combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expressing the energy in terms of quantum numbers n_1 and n_2? But no, n_x and n_y are appropriate here.\n\nAgain, coherence. So, yes, the problem's been solved.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy spectrum is given by \\boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\left(2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)} where \\(n_x\\) and \\(n_y\\) are non-negative integers.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743808204, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4401, prompt_tokens=1166, total_tokens=5567, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The potential given is \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). By converting this potential into Cartesian coordinates, we find that it simplifies to an anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential. 

In Cartesian coordinates, the potential becomes:
\[ V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \]

This potential corresponds to a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions. The angular frequencies for the oscillators are:
\[ \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \]
\[ \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \]

The energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator in each direction are given by:
\[ E_{n_x} = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]
\[ E_{n_y} = \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]

Substituting the frequencies \(\omega_x\) and \(\omega_y\) into these expressions, we get:
\[ E_{n_x, n_y} = 2 \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]

Combining the terms, the energy spectrum is:
\[ E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right) \]

where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).

### Final Answer
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.

n to be separable into terms that depend only on r and terms that depend only on θ. Let me rearrange the terms:

- (ħ²/(2m r²)) [ (r/R)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/Φ) d²Φ/dθ² ] + (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = E.

But the term (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] depends on both r and θ, so that would seem to prevent separability unless we can write the potential as a sum of terms each depending only on r or only on θ. Wait, actually, the potential is already written as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. That is, V(r, θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(r, θ), but V_θ still depends on both r and θ. Therefore, it's not possible to directly separate variables here because the angular part of the potential multiplies r².

Hmm. Wait, but perhaps if we factor out 1/r²? Let's see. V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ = [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ] r². Suppose we write this as V(r,θ) = k r² [ (1/2) + (3/2)cos²θ ].

If we consider [ (1/2) + (3/2)cos²θ ] multiplied by k r², perhaps rearrange the Schrödinger equation so that this term is grouped with the angular part.

Alternatively, is there a way to separate variables by multiplying through by 2m r² / ħ² or something?

Let me try manipulating the equation:

Original Schrödinger equation:
- (ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) + (1/r²)(d²ψ/dθ²) ] + (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] ψ = E ψ.

Multiply both sides by -2m/ħ²:

[ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) + (1/r²)(d²ψ/dθ²) ] - (2m/ħ²)[ (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] - E ] ψ = 0.

But this still mixes r and θ. Maybe rearranged as:

(1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) - (2m/ħ²)(1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] ψ + (1/r²)(d²ψ/dθ²) + (2m/ħ²)E ψ = 0.

Hmm. Not obvious how to separate here. Let me try substitution ψ(r,θ) = R(r)Φ(θ):

Then:

(1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) Φ + (1/r²) R d²Φ/dθ² - (m k / ħ²) r² [1 + 3 cos²θ] R Φ + (2m E / ħ²) R Φ = 0.

Divide through by R Φ:

[ (1/r R)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) ] + [ (1/r² Φ)(d²Φ/dθ²) ] - (m k / ħ²) r² [1 + 3 cos²θ ] + (2m E / ħ²) = 0.

Now, let's rearrange:

([1/(r R) d/dr (r dR/dr)] - (m k / ħ²) r² + (2m E / ħ²)) + [1/(r² Φ) d² Φ/dθ² - (m k / ħ²) r² (3 cos²θ) ] = 0.

But this still couples r and θ through the terms involving r² (3 cos²θ). Unless that term can somehow be combined with the angular derivative term... Let me see.

Suppose we move the angle-dependent term to the angular part. So:

The equation should equal zero. For separation of variables, we need terms depending only on r and terms depending only on θ to sum to a constant. Let's see:

Let me try grouping as follows:

Group the radial terms and the constant terms, and the angular terms:

Terms with R:

(1/(r R) d/dr ( r dR/dr )) - (m k / ħ² r² ) [ (1 + 3 cos²θ ) r^4 / r² ? Wait, no. Wait, hold on.)

Wait, perhaps I messed up. The potential term is proportional to r² [1 + 3 cos²θ], which would be expanded as (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ, and that term, when plugged into the equation, already has r² in both cases.

But when trying to separate variables, if the potential had only radial dependence, then it would work. However, here the potential has angular dependence multiplied by r², so both radial and angular parts would have terms mixed with r² and angles. Therefore, it's a problem. Hmm.

Maybe another approach, for potentials that are quadratic in r and have a angular dependence. In such cases, perhaps we can transform the coordinates. For example, stretch or compress the coordinates in different angular directions.

Wait, in 2D, let's think about coordinates. Suppose we go from polar coordinates to another coordinate system. Let me think... since the potential is of the form 1/2 kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ ). Let me compute what that potential is in Cartesian coordinates. Since x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so cosθ = x / r, so cos²θ = x² / r². Then:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ] = (1/2)k (x² + y²) [1 + 3 x² / (x² + y²)] = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Simplifying: V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 + 3/2) k x² + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! Wait a second. That seems like a significant simplification. That's V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So in Cartesian coordinates, this potential is a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator!

Hah! That makes much more sense. So by converting to Cartesian coordinates, we can see that the potential is actually separable into x and y components, each with different spring constants. So the original potential in polar coordinates maybe looked more complicated, but in Cartesian it's simply two independent harmonic oscillators with different frequencies. Thus, the energy spectrum can be found by combining the quantized energies from the x and y directions.

Wow, okay. So the crux was realizing that converting to Cartesian coordinates simplifies the potential. Let me just verify this calculation again. Starting with V(r,θ)= (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. In Cartesian coordinates, r² = x² + y², cosθ = x / r. Therefore:

V = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k(x² + y²)(x²)/(x² + y²) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y² + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 + 3/2) k x² + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, yes, it's an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along x and y.

Therefore, the Schrödinger equation becomes:

H = p_x²/(2m) + p_y²/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

But the usual form is H = p_x²/(2m) + (1/2) m ω_x² x² + p_y²/(2m) + (1/2) m ω_y² y². Therefore, comparing:

For the x-component: (1/2) m ω_x² x² = 2k x² ⇒ ω_x = sqrt(4k / m).

Similarly, for the y-component: (1/2) m ω_y² y² = (1/2)k y² ⇒ ω_y = sqrt(k / m).

Therefore, the Hamiltonian is H = ħ ω_x (a_x† a_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (a_y† a_y + 1/2).

Since in the x-direction we have ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) (since 4k/m ⇒ sqrt(4k/m)), and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Then the energy levels are given by:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) = 2 ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2) = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)].

Simplify that expression:

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2] = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2].

Alternatively, factoring out 1/2:

Wait, no. Let's see:

2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) = 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2. So yes.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2], where ω = sqrt(k/m). Wait, but is ω sqrt(k/m)?

Wait no.

Wait, ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). And ω_y = sqrt(k/m). So ħ ω_x = ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m), and ħ ω_y = ħ sqrt(k/m). It's almost that. So:

Expressing in terms of ω_x and ω_y:

E_{n_x, n_y} = (2 ħ sqrt(k/m)) (n_x + 1/2) + ( ħ sqrt(k/m) ) (n_y + 1/2 ) = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2 ) + (n_y + 1/2 ) ].

Thus:

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ sqrt(k/m) ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ).

Alternatively, factor sqrt(k/m):

Frequency terms are ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/m). It might be cleaner to write the energies in terms of these frequencies:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2).

But since ω_x = 2 ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m), and ω_y = ω.

Therefore, substituting back:

E_{n_x, n_y} = 2 ħ ω (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω (n_y + 1/2) = ħ ω [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ].

Regardless of notation, the key is that the x and y components of the oscillator have different frequencies, leading to contributions to the energy that are linear combinations of the quantum numbers n_x and n_y multiplied by their respective frequencies.

But wait, actually, for a standard two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in each direction, the energy would indeed be E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2). So the answer would directly be that? So in this problem, since ω_x is 2√(k/m) and ω_y is √(k/m), we can write the energy as:

E = ħ√(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]

Alternatively, combining terms:

E = ħ√(k/m) ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But is there a better way to express this? Since √(k/m) is the base frequency.

Yes, so perhaps write it in terms of ω = √(k/m), leading to E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). Alternatively, noting that combining the different contributions, but not sure. Let me cross-check. Alternatively, is there an alternative coordinate system where this problem can be re-expressed, but given that we've already transformed to Cartesian coordinates, which makes it separable, the answer should be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps we need to verify dimensions. The energy should have unit of ħ times frequency. The term (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) is dimensionless. And with ω being √(k/m), which has unit 1/s. So ħ ω is energy, so that's consistent.

Therefore, the energy levels are quantized as E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where n_x, n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...).

Alternatively, factor 3/2 as 1.5 or 3/2. Either way, but we can also write it with the constants:

E_{n_x,n_y} = 2 ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) but since ω_x = 2 ω and ω_y = ω, substituting back:

= 2*(ħ*2ω)*(n_x + 1/2) + ħ*ω*(n_y +1/2) ⟹ but that seems inconsistent. Wait no, it's E = ħ ω_x (n_x +1/2 ) + ħ ω_y (n_y +1/2 ). Which is, substituting ω_x = 2 ω, ω_y = ω:

E = ħ (2ω) (n_x +1/2 ) + ħ ω (n_y + 1/2 ) = ħ ω [ 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ ω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ].

Same answer as above. Therefore, whether telescoped through Cartesian coordinates potential or that the energy levels are additive in n_x and n_y.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the energy spectrum is given by:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ √(k/m) ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...).

Hence, we can report this as the energy spectrum.

Alternatively, another user might express it using different notation, perhaps replacing √(k/m) with ω. If we define ω = √(k/m), which is the standard frequency for a harmonic oscillator with spring constant k, then E_{n_x, n_y} is as above. So yes. Summarizing:

The given potential does map to an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator when converted to Cartesian coordinates, thereby allowing the problem to be separable. Since in Cartesian coordinates the potential is quadratic in x and y but with different force constants (resulting in different frequencies in x and y directions), the total energy becomes the sum of the individual oscillator energies. Therefore, the energy eigenvalues are E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where ω = √(k/m).

So plugging in that expression. It's lower energy when both n_x and n_y are 0. However, depending on the formula, that would be E = (0 + 0 + 3/2) ħ ω, which is (3/2)ħ ω. But I need to make sure whether that matches with harmonic oscillator potential in different directions. For instance, if each direction's ground state energy is (1/2) ħ ω_i. The x-direction has (1/2) ħ ω_x = (1/2) ħ * 2 ω = ħ ω. The y-direction has (1/2) ħ ω. Therefore, total ground state energy is ħ ω + (1/2) ħ ω = (3/2) ħ ω. So yes, exactly. Then, the first term in the sum with 2n_x + n_y.

Therefore, each excitation in the x-direction raises the energy by 2ħ ω, and each in the y-direction by 1ħ ω. So, different quantum numbers contribute differently, so the energy is a function that allows for combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps expressing the energy in terms of quantum numbers n_1 and n_2? But no, n_x and n_y are appropriate here.

Again, coherence. So, yes, the problem's been solved.

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.

For the equation to hold for all r and θ, each side must equal a separation constant. However, because the left side still depends on both r and θ via the potential term [1 + 3 cos²θ], this direct separation is not possible. Therefore, the equation is not separable in its current form.\n\nThis complicates matters because separation of variables is the standard technique for solving such problems. If separation isn\'t possible, we might need to look for other methods. Perhaps expanding the potential in terms of spherical harmonics or angular momentum eigenfunctions to diagonalize the angular part.\n\nAlternatively, could this potential be converted to a different coordinate system? For example, if we perform a variable substitution where cosθ is involved, but such a substitution might not straightforwardly simplify the equations.\n\nWait, if we recall that in three dimensions, quadrupole potentials or other anisotropic harmonic oscillators can have potentials which are functions of spherical harmonics. However, here we\'re in two dimensions. Maybe expressing cos²θ in terms of eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator in 2D. In 2D, the angular momentum is L = -iħ d/dθ, and the eigenfunctions are Φ(θ) = e^(ilθ), with l integer. The associated Legendre equation in 2D is just simple exponentials.\n\nExpressed in terms of these eigenfunctions, maybe we can Fourier expand the potential.\n\nFirst, let\'s consider the angular equation. d²Φ/dθ² = -l²Φ. But in our equation, the potential introduces a cos²θ term. Writing cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2, we can expand the potential term:\n\n[1 + 3 cos²θ] = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + 3/2 cos2θ = 5/2 + 3/2 cos2θ.\n\nThus, V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² [5/2 + 3/2 cos2θ] = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.\n\nIf we incorporate these terms into the Schrödinger equation, perhaps express the entire equation in terms of harmonics.\n\nSuppose we substitute the Fourier expansion for the angular dependence.\n\nAssume Φ(θ) is expressed as a sum over angular momentum eigenstates ∑ c_l e^(ilθ). However, the presence of cos2θ in the potential would couple different l states.\n\nAnother approach: Treat V as part of the angular momentum terms.\n\nAlternatively, after expanding to remove the angular variable. Let me structure the equation.\n\nThe Hamiltonian now becomes:\n\nH = -(ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) d/dr (r d/dr) + 1/r² d²/dθ² ] + (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.\n\nLooking at this, maybe the angular part can be considered a perturbation on the radial potential. However, since the angular term is multiplied by r² and cos2θ, the dependence on θ and r is intertwined, making a perturbation approach (for small coefficients, e.g.) invalid here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps change variables in such a way that the θ-dependent term becomes part of an effective centrifugal barrier or similar.\n\nIn polar coordinates with an azimuthal symmetry, the angular term usually appears as the angular momentum term with l². For instance, in the hydrogen atom or the 2D harmonic oscillator, the angular parts generate eigenvalues proportional to l². However, here, due to the cos2θ term, this symmetry is broken, which complicates matters.\n\nAlternatively, note that cos2θ can be related to the angular momentum operators. For example, in 2D, d²/dθ² is the angular part of the Laplacian and leads to eigenfunctions e^(ilθ) with eigenvalues -l². The term involving cos2θ can be linked to angular momentum transitions; more specifically, cos2θ = (e^(i2θ) + e^(-i2θ))/2, which suggests that it connects states differing by 2 units of angular momentum, l → l ± 2.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the cos2θ term in the potential introduces coupling between different angular momentum states separated by ±2. But since the entire potential is multiplied by r², both angular and radial parts are connected.\n\nThis suggests that the Schrödinger equation may not separate unless we take specific terms into account. Considering that, perhaps the approach is reminiscent of the 3D harmonic oscillator in spherical coordinates. Let me recall that in 3D, with V proportional to r², the radial and angular parts can be separated, with angular momentum l.\n\nBut in this 2D scenario with angular dependence in the potential, the usual separation doesn\'t hold. However, perhaps using an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Wait, in two dimensions but with an anharmonic term. Alternatively, maybe converting to Cartesian coordinates could help in separating variables.\n\nLet me try that. Expressing cosθ in terms of x and y. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Therefore, cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r². Therefore, potential in Cartesian coordinates becomes:\n\nV(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x² + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².\n\nTherefore, the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So it\'s actually an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along the x and y directions. That\'s a significant simplification! The original problem said "r, θ" but if we express the potential in Cartesian coordinates, it becomes a separable potential as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, which we can solve.\n\nOh, that might be the key! How come I didn\'t think of this earlier. Essentially, the potential V(r,θ) can be rewritten in terms of x and y with different stiffness in both directions, leading to independent harmonic oscillators in x and y. Let me check:\n\nOriginal potential: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.\n\nIn Cartesian, r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x / r, so cos²θ = x² / (x² + y²). Therefore, (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (3/2) k x². Then, the whole potential is:\n\n(1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k ] x² + (1/2)k y² = (2k)x² + (1/2k)y²? Wait, 1/2k y²? Wait, no:\n\nWait, compute again.\n\nOriginal: (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ\n\n= (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x²\n\n= (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + 3/2 k x²\n\n= (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y²\n\n= 2k x² + (1/2) k y².\n\nYes. So this is equivalent to a harmonic oscillator with spring constants k_x = 4k (since the potential is (1/2)k_x x² and we have 2k x², so coefficient for x: (1/2)k_x x^2 implying k_x = 4k and similarly for y-axis: (1/2) k y^2 which would have k_y = k.)\n\nWait, let\'s clarify. Let me write tensor notation.\n\nIn an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in 2D, V(x, y) = (1/2)m ω_x² x² + (1/2)m ω_y² y².\n\nIn our case, comparing with V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y², so if we set:\n\n(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k ⇒ ω_x² = 4k /m ⇒ ω_x = 2√(k/m)\n\nSimilarly, for y-component:\n\n(1/2)m ω_y² = 1/2 k ⇒ ω_y² = k/m ⇒ ω_y = √(k/m)\n\nTherefore, the spring constants converted into frequencies make the x-direction oscillator frequency twice that in the y-direction.\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum for an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in 2D is the sum of the 1D harmonic oscillator energies in each direction:\n\nE = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2) where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2,...). Plug in the frequencies we found:\n\nE = ħ*2√(k/m)(n_x + 1/2) + ħ√(k/m)(n_y + 1/2)\n\nFactor out ħ√(k/m):\n\nE = ħ√(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\n= ħ√(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]\n\n= ħ√(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]\n\nAlternatively, 2n_x + n_y can be expressed as some combination. It\'s important to note here that both n_x and n_y are non-negative integers. So the energy levels are quantized in terms of two quantum numbers. However, can this be expressed in terms of a single quantum number or some other combination?\n\nAlternatively, if we let n = 2n_x + n_y, then E = ħ√(k/m) (n + 3/2). However, the combination 2n_x + n_y allows multiple ways for different n_x and n_y to produce the same n. Therefore, the energy levels are degenerate.\n\nBut regardless, since the problem doesn\'t specify a particular form, we can express the spectrum as E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) with n_x, n_y non-negative integers.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for an anisotropic oscillator in 2D, the energy levels are labeled by two quantum numbers n_x and n_y, each for the respective direction, and the energy eigenvalues are sum of the individual terms. Since there\'s no relation like ω_x / ω_y = rational number that would lead to additional degeneracy. In this case, ω_x = 2 ω_y, since ω_x / ω_y = 2, so the frequencies aren\'t commensurate, leading each state (n_x, n_y) to have a unique energy, unless formally there\'s accidental degeneracy.\n\nAlternatively, since ω_x = 2 ω, where ω = √(k/m) is the y-direction frequency. So:\n\nE = ħ(2ω)(n_x + 1/2) + ħω(n_y + 1/2)\n\n= ħω [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]\n\n= ħω [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]\n\n= ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]\n\nSo yes, this is simply E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = √(k/m).\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum is equally spaced in terms of (2n_x + n_y), but for each combinations of non-negative integers n_x, n_y, we get a distinct energy level (possibly with some degeneracies). However, since 2n_x + n_y can be the same for different pairs (n_x, n_y), e.g., for (n_x=0, n_y=2) and (n_x=1, n_y=0), 2*0 + 2 = 2 and 2*1 + 0 = 2. So energy at E=ħω(2 + 3/2) = ħω(7/2) will be degenerate.\n\nBut the problem asks for the energy spectrum. So the answer is in terms of the quantum numbers n_x and n_y, but since the question says "energy spectrum," not necessarily the states or their degeneracies, writing the answer as...\n\nWait, perhaps applying separation of variables in Cartesian makes this problem straightforward. Therefore, after changing coordinates as I did, separating variables in x and y makes this a sum of two 1D harmonic oscillators in x and y with frequencies 2ω and ω, respectively, where ω = sqrt(k/m). Therefore, all energy levels can be written as E = ħ2ω(n_x + 1/2) + ħω(n_y + 1/2) = ħω [2(n_x + 1/2)+ (n_y + 1/2)].\n\nAlternatively, note another potential confounder is units.\n\nBut original potential is supposed natural since spring constants can be in different directions, which apparently in Cartesian directions here x and y. Then converting to Cartesian makes it separable, which I might not have considered at first.\n\nTherefore the answer is derived straightforwardly from standard harmonic oscillator results when converted into Cartesian coordinates, showing that the problem is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Thus, the energy is:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = sqrt(k/m) and n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2,...\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy spectrum written via quantum numbers linked to polar coordinates. Alternatively, maybe we can substitute these into involving another quantum number but since in polar coordinates for 2D, but separation wasn\'t feasible. But since converting to Cartesian gives a separable equation leading to this energy expression, which is correct. Henceboxed answer would be this energy spectrum. However, should the exact form use these specific terms?\n\nWait, observe that ω equals sqrt(k/m), indeed.\n\nMoreover, the standard harmonic oscillator in 2D this is the same even if the oscillator is isotropic. But here extra are derivations.\n\nYes, okay, in classical mechanics the anisotropic oscillator frequencies would differ. So quantum mechanically, the energy eigenvalues are just sums of the respective 1D oscillators. Therefore the energy should be as above.\n\nAlternatively, check another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s go the polar coordinates with the Angular equation -- possible but leads to complications.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions under the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we first convert the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

The potential in polar coordinates is rewritten using \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \) and \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \):
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2} k x^2
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} kx^2 + \frac{1}{2} ky^2 + \frac{3}{2} kx^2 = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2
\]

This potential represents an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. The energy levels for a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator are given by the sum of the energies from each direction:
\[
E = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Here, the angular frequencies \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \) are determined by the respective spring constants. For the \( x \)-direction, the potential \( 2kx^2 \) corresponds to a spring constant \( k_x = 4k \), giving:
\[
\omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{k_x}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{4k}{m}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

For the \( y \)-direction, the potential \( \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \) corresponds to a spring constant \( k_y = k \), giving:
\[
\omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

Substituting these frequencies into the energy expression:
\[
E = \hbar \left(2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\right) \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\right) \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):
\[
E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right]
\]
\[
= \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)
\]

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by:
\[
\boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]
where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

.

Divide both sides by RΦ:

-(ħ²/(2m))[ (1/R)(1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/(r²Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² ] + (1/2)kr²[1 + 3 cos²θ] = E.

Move the angular and radial terms:

-(ħ²/(2m)) [(1/r R)(d/dr)(r dR/dr)] + (1/2)kr²[1 + 3 cos²θ] - E = (ħ²/(2m)) (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ².

Let's call the left side F(r,θ) and the right side G(r,θ). For the equation to hold for all r and θ, each side must equal a separation constant. However, because the left side still depends on both r and θ via the potential term [1 + 3 cos²θ], this direct separation is not possible. Therefore, the equation is not separable in its current form.

This complicates matters because separation of variables is the standard technique for solving such problems. If separation isn't possible, we might need to look for other methods. Perhaps expanding the potential in terms of spherical harmonics or angular momentum eigenfunctions to diagonalize the angular part.

Alternatively, could this potential be converted to a different coordinate system? For example, if we perform a variable substitution where cosθ is involved, but such a substitution might not straightforwardly simplify the equations.

Wait, if we recall that in three dimensions, quadrupole potentials or other anisotropic harmonic oscillators can have potentials which are functions of spherical harmonics. However, here we're in two dimensions. Maybe expressing cos²θ in terms of eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator in 2D. In 2D, the angular momentum is L = -iħ d/dθ, and the eigenfunctions are Φ(θ) = e^(ilθ), with l integer. The associated Legendre equation in 2D is just simple exponentials.

Expressed in terms of these eigenfunctions, maybe we can Fourier expand the potential.

First, let's consider the angular equation. d²Φ/dθ² = -l²Φ. But in our equation, the potential introduces a cos²θ term. Writing cos²θ as (1 + cos2θ)/2, we can expand the potential term:

[1 + 3 cos²θ] = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + 3/2 cos2θ = 5/2 + 3/2 cos2θ.

Thus, V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² [5/2 + 3/2 cos2θ] = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

If we incorporate these terms into the Schrödinger equation, perhaps express the entire equation in terms of harmonics.

Suppose we substitute the Fourier expansion for the angular dependence.

Assume Φ(θ) is expressed as a sum over angular momentum eigenstates ∑ c_l e^(ilθ). However, the presence of cos2θ in the potential would couple different l states.

Another approach: Treat V as part of the angular momentum terms.

Alternatively, after expanding to remove the angular variable. Let me structure the equation.

The Hamiltonian now becomes:

H = -(ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) d/dr (r d/dr) + 1/r² d²/dθ² ] + (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Looking at this, maybe the angular part can be considered a perturbation on the radial potential. However, since the angular term is multiplied by r² and cos2θ, the dependence on θ and r is intertwined, making a perturbation approach (for small coefficients, e.g.) invalid here.

Alternatively, perhaps change variables in such a way that the θ-dependent term becomes part of an effective centrifugal barrier or similar.

In polar coordinates with an azimuthal symmetry, the angular term usually appears as the angular momentum term with l². For instance, in the hydrogen atom or the 2D harmonic oscillator, the angular parts generate eigenvalues proportional to l². However, here, due to the cos2θ term, this symmetry is broken, which complicates matters.

Alternatively, note that cos2θ can be related to the angular momentum operators. For example, in 2D, d²/dθ² is the angular part of the Laplacian and leads to eigenfunctions e^(ilθ) with eigenvalues -l². The term involving cos2θ can be linked to angular momentum transitions; more specifically, cos2θ = (e^(i2θ) + e^(-i2θ))/2, which suggests that it connects states differing by 2 units of angular momentum, l → l ± 2.

Therefore, the presence of the cos2θ term in the potential introduces coupling between different angular momentum states separated by ±2. But since the entire potential is multiplied by r², both angular and radial parts are connected.

This suggests that the Schrödinger equation may not separate unless we take specific terms into account. Considering that, perhaps the approach is reminiscent of the 3D harmonic oscillator in spherical coordinates. Let me recall that in 3D, with V proportional to r², the radial and angular parts can be separated, with angular momentum l.

But in this 2D scenario with angular dependence in the potential, the usual separation doesn't hold. However, perhaps using an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Wait, in two dimensions but with an anharmonic term. Alternatively, maybe converting to Cartesian coordinates could help in separating variables.

Let me try that. Expressing cosθ in terms of x and y. In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Therefore, cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r². Therefore, potential in Cartesian coordinates becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Simplify:

= (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k + 3/2 k) x² + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Therefore, the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So it's actually an anisotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with different spring constants along the x and y directions. That's a significant simplification! The original problem said "r, θ" but if we express the potential in Cartesian coordinates, it becomes a separable potential as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator, which we can solve.

Oh, that might be the key! How come I didn't think of this earlier. Essentially, the potential V(r,θ) can be rewritten in terms of x and y with different stiffness in both directions, leading to independent harmonic oscillators in x and y. Let me check:

Original potential: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

In Cartesian, r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x / r, so cos²θ = x² / (x² + y²). Therefore, (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (3/2) k x². Then, the whole potential is:

(1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k ] x² + (1/2)k y² = (2k)x² + (1/2k)y²? Wait, 1/2k y²? Wait, no:

Wait, compute again.

Original: (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ

= (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x²

= (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + 3/2 k x²

= (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y²

= 2k x² + (1/2) k y².

Yes. So this is equivalent to a harmonic oscillator with spring constants k_x = 4k (since the potential is (1/2)k_x x² and we have 2k x², so coefficient for x: (1/2)k_x x^2 implying k_x = 4k and similarly for y-axis: (1/2) k y^2 which would have k_y = k.)

Wait, let's clarify. Let me write tensor notation.

In an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in 2D, V(x, y) = (1/2)m ω_x² x² + (1/2)m ω_y² y².

In our case, comparing with V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y², so if we set:

(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k ⇒ ω_x² = 4k /m ⇒ ω_x = 2√(k/m)

Similarly, for y-component:

(1/2)m ω_y² = 1/2 k ⇒ ω_y² = k/m ⇒ ω_y = √(k/m)

Therefore, the spring constants converted into frequencies make the x-direction oscillator frequency twice that in the y-direction.

Therefore, the energy spectrum for an anisotropic harmonic oscillator in 2D is the sum of the 1D harmonic oscillator energies in each direction:

E = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2) where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0, 1, 2,...). Plug in the frequencies we found:

E = ħ*2√(k/m)(n_x + 1/2) + ħ√(k/m)(n_y + 1/2)

Factor out ħ√(k/m):

E = ħ√(k/m) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

= ħ√(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]

= ħ√(k/m) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Alternatively, 2n_x + n_y can be expressed as some combination. It's important to note here that both n_x and n_y are non-negative integers. So the energy levels are quantized in terms of two quantum numbers. However, can this be expressed in terms of a single quantum number or some other combination?

Alternatively, if we let n = 2n_x + n_y, then E = ħ√(k/m) (n + 3/2). However, the combination 2n_x + n_y allows multiple ways for different n_x and n_y to produce the same n. Therefore, the energy levels are degenerate.

But regardless, since the problem doesn't specify a particular form, we can express the spectrum as E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) with n_x, n_y non-negative integers.

Alternatively, recall that for an anisotropic oscillator in 2D, the energy levels are labeled by two quantum numbers n_x and n_y, each for the respective direction, and the energy eigenvalues are sum of the individual terms. Since there's no relation like ω_x / ω_y = rational number that would lead to additional degeneracy. In this case, ω_x = 2 ω_y, since ω_x / ω_y = 2, so the frequencies aren't commensurate, leading each state (n_x, n_y) to have a unique energy, unless formally there's accidental degeneracy.

Alternatively, since ω_x = 2 ω, where ω = √(k/m) is the y-direction frequency. So:

E = ħ(2ω)(n_x + 1/2) + ħω(n_y + 1/2)

= ħω [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]

= ħω [2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]

= ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

So yes, this is simply E = ħω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = √(k/m).

Therefore, the energy spectrum is equally spaced in terms of (2n_x + n_y), but for each combinations of non-negative integers n_x, n_y, we get a distinct energy level (possibly with some degeneracies). However, since 2n_x + n_y can be the same for different pairs (n_x, n_y), e.g., for (n_x=0, n_y=2) and (n_x=1, n_y=0), 2*0 + 2 = 2 and 2*1 + 0 = 2. So energy at E=ħω(2 + 3/2) = ħω(7/2) will be degenerate.

But the problem asks for the energy spectrum. So the answer is in terms of the quantum numbers n_x and n_y, but since the question says "energy spectrum," not necessarily the states or their degeneracies, writing the answer as...

Wait, perhaps applying separation of variables in Cartesian makes this problem straightforward. Therefore, after changing coordinates as I did, separating variables in x and y makes this a sum of two 1D harmonic oscillators in x and y with frequencies 2ω and ω, respectively, where ω = sqrt(k/m). Therefore, all energy levels can be written as E = ħ2ω(n_x + 1/2) + ħω(n_y + 1/2) = ħω [2(n_x + 1/2)+ (n_y + 1/2)].

Alternatively, note another potential confounder is units.

But original potential is supposed natural since spring constants can be in different directions, which apparently in Cartesian directions here x and y. Then converting to Cartesian makes it separable, which I might not have considered at first.

Therefore the answer is derived straightforwardly from standard harmonic oscillator results when converted into Cartesian coordinates, showing that the problem is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Thus, the energy is:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħω(2n_x + n_y + 3/2), where ω = sqrt(k/m) and n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2,...

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy spectrum written via quantum numbers linked to polar coordinates. Alternatively, maybe we can substitute these into involving another quantum number but since in polar coordinates for 2D, but separation wasn't feasible. But since converting to Cartesian gives a separable equation leading to this energy expression, which is correct. Henceboxed answer would be this energy spectrum. However, should the exact form use these specific terms?

Wait, observe that ω equals sqrt(k/m), indeed.

Moreover, the standard harmonic oscillator in 2D this is the same even if the oscillator is isotropic. But here extra are derivations.

Yes, okay, in classical mechanics the anisotropic oscillator frequencies would differ. So quantum mechanically, the energy eigenvalues are just sums of the respective 1D oscillators. Therefore the energy should be as above.

Alternatively, check another approach to confirm.

Alternatively, let's go the polar coordinates with the Angular equation -- possible but leads to complications. But as converting to Cartesian, the benefit, more straightforward.

Let me check once again. In Cartesian, with the potential V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2) k y². Then, how wrong is it to say that we have particle-in-a-box, but no−it's an oscillator, hence energy for each coordinate.

Therefore, the total energy spectrum each direction:

E_x = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) where ω_x = sqrt(k_x/m). Wait, in x-direction potential is (1/2)k_x x² which we compared to 2k x². Hence (1/2)k_x = 2k --> k_x = 4k. But alternate formulations, if part of the Hamiltonian's kinetic and potential terms might lead me astray. Alternatively, start with the most basic approach. 1D harmonic oscillator has energy levels ħω(n + 1/2), where ω=sqrt(k/m). So in V(x, y)= 2k x² + (1/2)k y²: For x-coordinate: term is 2k x² = (1/2)(4k) x² Hence equivalent to a HO with k_x=4k. Thus, angular frequency ω_x= sqrt(k_x/m)= sqrt(4k/m)= 2 sqrt(k/m), which is 2ω, ω being sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-term: (1/2) k y² corresponds to k_y = k, hence ω_y = sqrt(k/m) = ω. Therefore energy is ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2). Hence:

E = ħ*(2ω)(n_x +1/2) + ħω(n_y +1/2).

Factor out ħω:

E = ħω [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)].

= ħω [2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2]

= ħω(2n_x + n_y +3/2.)

Thus, backing through this—so therefore my conclusion seems correct.

Alternative Notation: Sometimes, in literature, the 2D & anisotropic oscillator's energy levels would be presented in terms of two quantum numbers. However, in polar coordinates, due to the interaction term, It would be more complicated but in Cartesian coordinates, it's simple.

Given this conversion, in Cartesians, we, therefore, demonstrated that E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2). So the energy spectrum is quantized in terms of these two integers n_x and n_y, each ≥0.

Let me just verify with a case.n_x=0，n_y=0： E= (0+0+3/2) ħω = (3/2) \hbar ω, which seems okay. For n_x=1, n_y=0: 2*1 +0 + 3/2 =  2 + 3/2=7/2 . Similarly, n_x=0, n_y=2: with E= (0 + 2 + 3/2)= 7/2.

Thus, there's degeneracy here.E = 7/2 can be achieved by (1,0) and (0,2), hence it's two-fold degenerate. Similarly, higher energy levels have more degeneracy. So the energy levels Es are manually ( 3/2, 5/2, 7/2 x2, 9/2 x2, etc.), but as per different combinations of n_x and n_y.

But again, the energy spectrum is discrete and goes in tiers with each combination. However, whether the user wants the answer written in terms of n_x and n_y or another quantum number? Since in polar coordinates, the problem was initially phrased, but converting to Cartesian made it straightforward.

Therefore, the answer that the problem requires is the energy expressed in terms of n_x and n_y, granting the separability in Cartesian coordinates. Thus, boxed, it would need to use the harmonic oscillator form.

Alternatively, since the problem said "Find the energy spectrum," it's likely expecting such an answer: so E = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x + n_y + 3/2) for non-negative integers n_x, n_y. Alternatively, present it accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps merge it differently. Let me note that 2n_x + n_y is a combination where the energy increments when either n_x or n_y increases. For each increment in n_x by 1, the energy increases by 2ħω, and each increment in n_y, by 1ħω. So the possible energy levels are spaced at intervals of ħω but depend on how you mix n_x and n_y.

But since the spectrum allows multiple combinations for higher energies, we need to list the generic form as done.

Therefore, in conclusion, with ω = sqrt(k/m), the energy spectrum is:

E_{n_x,n_y} = \hbar \omega \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right), \quad n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, \ldots

Hence, boxed, this would be presented as:

\boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)}.

**Final Answer**

The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)}, where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

Therefore, the total energy for the anisotropic oscillator in 2D is the sum of the energies from the \\( x \\)- and \\( y \\)-components:\n\\[ E_{n_x, n_y} = \\hbar \\omega_x \\left(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\hbar \\omega_y \\left(n_y + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\( \\omega_x \\) and \\( \\omega_y \\):\n\\[ E_{n_x, n_y} = 2\\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\left(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\left(n_y + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\]\n\nFactoring out \\( \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\):\n\\[ E_{n_x, n_y} = \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\left[ 2 \\left(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(n_y + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right] \\]\n\\[ = \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\left(2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\]\n\nThus, the energy spectrum is:\n\\[ \\boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\left(2n_x + n_y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)} \\]\nwhere \\( n_x \\) and \\( n_y \\) are non-negative integers.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=' split into a radial part and angular part not mixed with r. But right now, the potential term has both r² and a function of θ. To separate, multiply through by 2m/(ħ²):\n\n[ - (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr)/R - (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² ] + (2m/ħ²) (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ) = 2m E / ħ².\n\nThis seems complicated because terms involving r and θ are mixed. If we can arrange them such that terms containing r are on one side and θ on the other, separated by a constant.\n\nLet me try moving all terms involving r to the left and all terms with θ to the right (Notation might get messy here):\n\n- [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) ) / R ] + (2m/ħ²)(1/2) k r² = [ (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² ) ] - (2m/ħ²)(1/2) k 3 r² cos²θ + 2m E / ħ².\n\nBut this doesn’t separate neatly. The terms on the right still have r dependence through r², which is supposed to only appear on the left. So this approach might not work. Hence, perhaps variables aren’t separable in polar coordinates?\n\nHmm, maybe we need an alternative coordinate system. Suppose instead we use Cartesian coordinates. V(x,y) is then written as (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x², since cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x² / r², so 1/2 k r² + 3/2 k x². Then that gives:\n\nV(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k y² + (1/2 + 3/2)k x² = 2 k x² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, V(x,y) is 2 k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! In Cartesian coordinates, this potential is actually a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, where the x and y components have different spring constants. Thus, maybe bringing it into Cartesian coordinates simplifies the problem, and the separation is straightforward.\n\nWait a second, that is plausible. Let\'s check. Start with the potential expression:\n\nOriginal in polar coordinates: V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.\n\nExpressing in Cartesian coordinates, recognize that r² = x² + y². So:\n\nV(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2)k + (3/2)k )x² + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².\n\nTherefore, the potential is in the form of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in x and y directions: V(x, y) = ½ m ω_x² x² + ½ m ω_y² y². But in our case, the coefficient for x² is 2k, so ½ m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = 4k/m. Similarly, the coefficient for y² is (1/2)k, so ½ m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = k/m. Hence, ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m).\n\nSo, given that in Cartesian coordinates this is just a combination of two independent harmonic oscillators with frequencies ω_x and ω_y, the energy levels would be the sum of the energies from each oscillator. Therefore, in 2D, the energy is E = ħω_x(n_x + ½) + ħω_y(n_y + ½), where n_x, n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Plugging in ω_x and ω_y:\n\nE = ħ*(2√(k/m))*(n_x + ½) + ħ*(√(k/m))*(n_y + ½). Factor out ħ√(k/m), which is the quantum of energy for the original isotropic oscillator with ω = √(k/m). Let\'s compute:\n\nLet ω = √(k/m), so E can be written as ħω [2(n_x + ½) + (n_y + ½)] = ħω [2n_x + 1 + n_y + ½ ] = ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]. Hence:\n\nE = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2), with n_x, n_y = 0,1,2,...\n\nAlternatively, this can be expressed as E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).\n\nBut let me confirm this transformation once more. If in the Cartesian coordinates, the potential is 2k x² + (1/2) k y², then the equivalent expressions for the angular frequencies are indeed ω_x = √( (2k)/(m) ) and ω_y = √( (k/2)/m ) ?\n\nWait wait, hold on, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check again:\n\nThe harmonic oscillator potential energy is ½ m ω_x² x². For the x-component, in our case: 2k x² = ½ m ω_x² x². Then solving for ω_x:\n\n2k = ½ m ω_x² → ω_x² = 4k / m → ω_x = 2√(k/m). Similarly, for the y-component: ½ k y² which is equal to ½ m ω_y² y². Therefore, (1/2)k = ½ m ω_y² → ω_y² = k / m → ω_y = √(k / m). So that\'s as before.\n\nHence, indeed, in terms of energies when we quantize each direction, the x-direction harmonic oscillator has energy levels ħω_x (n_x + ½) and similarly for the y-direction. Therefore, total energy is:\n\nE = ħω_x(n_x + ½) + ħω_y(n_y + ½ )\n\nPlugging ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m). But take note that ħω_x is 2ħ√(k/m), and ω_y is 1√(k/m). Let me express ω0 = √(k/m) as a common term. Then ω_x = 2ω0 and ω_y = ω0. So:\n\nE = 2ħω0(n_x + ½) + ħω0(n_y + ½) = ħω0 [2(n_x + ½) + (n_y + ½)] = ħω0 [2n_x +1 +n_y + ½] = ħω0 [2n_x + n_y + 3/2].\n\nWhich matches the previous conclusion. So the energy spectrum is E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), with n_x and n_y being non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). This seems correct.\n\nBut I need to return to the original coordinates. The problem presents the potential in polar coordinates, so I just transformed it into Cartesian correctly and solved via known oscillator solutions. Since the potential in Cartesian ends up as 2k x² + (1/2)k y², leading to anisotropic oscillator, this suggests that the energy spectrum is derived straightforwardly from separation in x and y. So why didn\'t the potential seem to allow variable separation in polar coordinates? It probably can’t be easily separated in polar coordinates, but switching to Cartesian coordinates reveals a hidden separation which simplifies the problem significantly.\n\nMoreover, this implies that the energy levels depend on two quantum numbers, n_x and n_y, as expected in Cartesian coordinates. However, traditionally, in polar coordinates, quantum numbers are linked to radial and angular modes, here n and m perhaps. But in this case, converting to Cartesian coordinates leads us just to consider separation into x and y, hence N_x and N_y.\n\nAlternative way to see that: if in Cartesian coordinates, it\'s separable into x and y, so quantized as two independent oscillators. Hence, the overall wavefunction is a product of x and y oscillator eigenstates, and the energy is the sum of their energies.\n\nThus, the result seems correct, given the cross-check through multiple steps.\n\nHmm, but let me verify once more for mistakes in transformation. Suppose starting from original polar V(r,θ)= (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Then in Cartesian coordinates, V(x,y)= (1/2)k(x²+y²) + (3/2)k x² (since cosθ = x/r and r² = x² + y², so 3/2k x²). Let\'s compute:\n\n(1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2k + 3/2k) x² + (1/2k)y² = (2k x²) + (0.5k y²) yeah, so that\'s correct.\n\nHence, the potential is twice the harmonic potential in x and half the harmonic potential in y. So with different frequencies. So energy for each direction is calculated separately, then summed.\n\nRecall that for a 1D harmonic oscillator with potential V(x) = ½ m ω² x², the energy levels are E_n = ħ ω (n + ½). Here, for x-component:\n\nThe potential is 2k x², which is ½ m ω_x² x², and from before ω_x = 2√(k/m), yes, and energy levels in x: E_x = ħ ω_x(n_x + ½) = 2 ħ √(k/m) (n_x + ½ ). Similarly, for y-direction, V(y)=0.5k y² = ½ m ω_y² y² => ω_y= sqrt(k/m) as before. Then E_y= ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + ½ ).\n\nTotal Energy: E = E_x + E_y = 2ħ√(k/m)(n_x + ½ ) + ħ√(k/m )(n_y + ½ ). Then as before, factoring out ħ√(k/m):\n\nE = ħ√(k/m)[ 2(n_x + ½ ) + (n_y + ½ ) ] = ħ√(k/m)( 2n_x +1 +n_y + ½ ) = ħ√(k/m) [2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ].\n\nSo the energy levels are E_{n_x,n_y} = ħω(2n_x +n_y +3/2 ), with ω=√(k/m). Thus each energy level is determined by two non-negative integers n_x and n_y. Even though the original problem was given in polar coordinates, transitioning to Cartesian separated variables, allowing the use of known harmonic oscillator solutions for each direction. Hence, the energy spectrum is obtained through summation of energies from each degree of freedom.\n\nBut, being an experienced problem-solver, perhaps I need to confirm if there\'s any other approach. For example, could the initial potential be treated as a standard central potential with an angular perturbation? In that case, perturbation theory might be relevant. However, if the transformation to Cartesian coordinates diagonalizes the potential into independent harmonic oscillators, then it\'s exact, which would be preferable.\n\nAlternatively, checking for known potentials in 2D, maybe. Suppose if the potential doesn\'t separate in polar coordinates, but when transitioning to Cartesian and separating, leading to different oscillators... But do we need to worry about this going back to polar? Well, since once separated in different coordinates, the energy states convert into tensor products of x and y states, regardless of the original coordinates given. So I think this line of thought is consistent and correct.\n\nAnother check: Let\'s suppose k=0, in which case we have a free particle, but since k is non-zero here, we can\'t test the scenario. But k-traces back to both x and y components.\n\nAlternatively, if the particle\'s Hamiltonian is in Cartesian coordinates,\n\nH = (p_x² + p_y²)/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2) k y².\n\nClearly, this is separable into x and y components. So H = H_x + H_y, and within each part, H_x = p_x²/(2m) + 2k x², similarly H_y = p_y²/(2m) + (1/2)k y².\n\nHence, solving in Cartesian coordinates allows for easy variable separation, leading to separate quantum numbers in x and y. Then the energy spectra are additive.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\nBut in some textbooks, like the Landau-Lifshitz quantum mechanics, or other standard QM texts, 2D harmonic oscillators are treated. Indeed, when the frequencies are commensurate, other degeneracies arise, but here with ω_x = 2 ω_y (if ω_x is twice the ω_y; since in our case ω_x = 2√(k/m), ω_y = sqrt(k/m), so indeed ω_x = 2 ω_y), then certain degeneracies would occur. But for the purpose of finding the energy spectrum, these considerations pertain to the structure of the energy levels, which here we can just state in terms of separate quantum numbers.\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum is E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2 n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). Alternatively, one can factor out the factor to get units.\n\nAnother way to write it would be: if we denote ω = sqrt(k/m), then E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps reorganize the terms:\n\nE = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y ) + 3/2 ħ ω.\n\nAlternatively, if we let n = 2n_x + n_y, then the energies would still depend on how n_x and n_y are combined, but because of the different coefficients, it\'s an alternating spectrum. However, the integers n_x and n_y can be 0,1,2,..., resulting in possible energies E_{n} in steps differing by ℏω.\n\nAlternatively, if we substitute j = 2n_x + n_y, but j can take values 0,1,2,...\n\nBut n_x and n_y are independent. Let\'s try:\n\nFor example, fixing j = 2n_x +n_y.\n\nIf n_x =0, then j =0,1,2,3,... as n_y =0,1,2,…\n\nIf n_x =1, then 2 +0=2, 2+1=3, 2+2=4, etc.\n\nSimilarly, meaning for any j, n_x can be 0 to floor(j/2), and n_y =j - 2n_x.\n\nHence, each j corresponds to a set of (n_x, n_y) pairs. Therefore, the energy can be written as E = ħω(j + 3/2 ). But each j can be achieved in multiple ways with multiple (n_x, n_y), leading to each energy level E_j having a specific degeneracy. However, although that could be a valid way of representing the energy in terms of a single index j, the problem asks for the energy spectrum, which is the set of possible energy values. Since different combinations of (n_x, n_y) can give different j such that j =2n_x +n_y, then the energy spectrum can be parameterized either by (n_x, n_y) or by j. However, not all j values are possible unless additional conditions are met. For example, j must be an integer greater than or equal to 0. For each j, n_x can be 0 to floor(j/2), and n_y =j - 2n_x. Since n_y must be non-negative, this restricts n_x ≤ floor(j/2).\n\nWait: Explicitly, for given j, n_x can range from n_x=0 to n_x_max = floor( (j)/2 ). Then, number of states for each j would be n_x_max +1. For example, j=0: n_x=0, n_y=0. Only one state. j=1: n_x can only be 0 (since 2*1=2 >1), so n_x=0, n_y=1. So only one state. j=2: n_x can be 0 or1. n_x=0⇒n_y=2; n_x=1⇒n_y=0. Two states. Etc. Hence, dynastic degeneracy varies with j.\n\nBut regardless, the energy would be E = ħω(j + 3/2 ). Hence, possible energies at: ( ⌜ 3/2 ).\n\nHowever, this introduces confusion. Since (even though for different j, there exist multiple (n_x, n_y)), the multiplicities change. But the energy levels have certain degeneracies. For answering the problem, given that the problem is self-standing and probably expects a simple expression, regardless of the coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, write the spectrum in the original Cartesian variable-separated form, which is the sum of them. Therefore, the answer is as we had in prior steps: E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x +n_y +3/2). Since the problem doesn’t specify expressing the energy levels in terms of a single (combined) quantum number, presumably the solution has two quantum numbers, and the energy is given in this combined way. Therefore, that (2n_x +n_y +3/2) might not be further simplified, but remains as is.\n\nAlternatively, let me verify with a small transition.\n\nAlternative representation: The energy is proportional to 2n_x +n_y, leading to Eigenvalues which are (with multiplier ħ√(k/m)) different for different combinations. However, perhaps listing this as the parametrized form for E, given that combination of n_x and n_y.\n\nAlternatively, I can reflect on possible mistakes: E.g., In the step where we converted V into Cartesian, perhaps a miscalculation. Let\'s double-check:\n\nOriginal Potential in polar: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Express as:\n\n= (1/2)kr² [1 +3 cos²θ ].\n\nWhen translating to cartesian coordinates, cosθ = x / sqrt(x² + y²). Hence, cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²). So plugging into V(r,θ):\n\nV=(1/2)k(x²+y²) [1 +3(x²)/(x² + y²)] →\n\n=[1/2 k (x² + y²) ] + [3/2 k x² ];\n\nbut wait, that would result in (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let\'s check:\n\n50% for x² + y² multiplying k and 150% for x² multiplying k.\n\nWait, in English: the potential is V(r,θ) = ½ k r² + ³⁄₂ k r² cos²θ. So group it:\n\n= ½ k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ )\n\nWhen converting to x,y (Cartesian):\n\n= ½ k (x² + y²)(1 + 3 (x²/(x²+y²)))\n\n= ½ k [ (x² + y² ) + 3x² ] \n\nDo the (x² + y² ) +3x² become \n\nx² + y² +3x² = 4x² + y². \n\nMultiplying all by ½ k:\n\nThus, V(x,y) = ½ k (4x² + y² ) = 2k x² + (1/2) k y².\n\nTherefore, correct. So thus in x and y it\'s separate harmonic potentials with different strengths. Hence, confirming V is axially anisotropic, giving different frequencies for x , y.\n\nTherefore the remaining steps are confirmed. Hence, the energy levels must have different contributions from x and y. Therefore, quantizing:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} =  (n_x + ½ )ħω_x + (n_y + ½ )ħω_y,\n\nwhere ω_x = sqrt(stiffness_x/m). Now, revisiting this, the "stiffness" in x direction is V(x) = 2k x². In the case of harmonic oscillator, ½ m ω^2 x², so for x, comparing: 2k =1/2 m ω_x² ⇒ω_x =sqrt(4k/m)=2*sqrt(k/m).Similarly, V(y)=1/2* k y², so ½ k y²=½ m ω_y² y²⇒ω_y= sqrt(k/m).\n\nHence, replace ω_x and ω_y with sqrt(k/m), ω_x=2 sqrt(k/m), ω_y= sqrt(k/m).\n\nEnergy:\n\nE = ħ*(2 sqrt(k/m))*(n_x +1/2 ) + ħ*sqrt(k/m)*(n_y + 1/2 ).\n\nFactor out ħ*sqrt(k/m):\n\nE = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x +1/2 ) + (n_y +1/2 ) ].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= ħ sqrt(k/m)[2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2 ]\n\n= ħ sqrt(k/m)[2n_x +n_y +3/2 ].\n\nThis is in line with our previous conclusion. Therefore, the energy depends on the quantum numbers n_x and n_y. Hence, the answer should look like this.\n\nBut to write the final E in terms of m, k, hbar: Let\'s note that √(k/m) is ω_0 for the normal oscillator (for the y-direction). But given that:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )\n\nBut fractions in equations can be adjusted:\n\nAlternatively, factor the ½ out.\n\nE = ½ ħ√(k/m) [ 4n_x +2n_y +3 ].\n\nBut it\'s the same as before. Alternatively, done for writing fractions as... but no, existing form is simpler.\n\nLet me think,  should I relate this to the principal quantum number or suggest the degeneracy?\n\nNo—just need the energy spectrum, which is the possible energy levels for any allowed n_x and n_y.\n\nBut the problem as stated:\n\n‘‘‘A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ)’’’… so I think more context might be on potential’s form in polar coordinates, yet my solution note that a coordinate transform conceives a separation of variables and solve it via harmonic oscillators in Cartesian. So need to confirm that this approach is valid.\n\nBut given that in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is separable, and separable solutions exist with normalized wavefunctions, which are products of 1D harmonic oscillator states. Therefore,  this method is entirely acceptable and since in QM, choice of coordinates when solving SE must correlateto separability.\n\nThen confidently, the energy spectrum is as derived above.\n\nTherefore, put confidence points behind this conclusion.\n\nConclusion: Via transformation to Cartesian coordinates, energy spectrum rationally deduced as permutations of two harmonic oscillators, sum partaking coefficients leading to E = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ).

The given potential for a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions is \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). To find the energy spectrum, we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

First, we recognize that the potential can be rewritten as:
\[ V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 \left(1 + 3 \cos^2(\theta)\right) \]

In Cartesian coordinates, where \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r} \), the potential becomes:
\[ V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2} k (x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2} k x^2 \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 + \frac{1}{2} k y^2 + \frac{3}{2} k x^2 \]
\[ = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2} ky^2 \]

This potential represents an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. The angular frequencies for these oscillators are:
\[ \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \quad \text{and} \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \]

The energy levels for a 1D harmonic oscillator are given by \( E_n = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{1}{2}) \). Therefore, the total energy for the anisotropic oscillator in 2D is the sum of the energies from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-components:
\[ E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]

Substituting the values of \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \):
\[ E_{n_x, n_y} = 2\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \]

Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):
\[ E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left[ 2 \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right) \right] \]
\[ = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right) \]

Thus, the energy spectrum is:
\[ \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} \]
where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

 split into a radial part and angular part not mixed with r. But right now, the potential term has both r² and a function of θ. To separate, multiply through by 2m/(ħ²):

[ - (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr)/R - (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² ] + (2m/ħ²) (1/2)k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ) = 2m E / ħ².

This seems complicated because terms involving r and θ are mixed. If we can arrange them such that terms containing r are on one side and θ on the other, separated by a constant.

Let me try moving all terms involving r to the left and all terms with θ to the right (Notation might get messy here):

- [ (1/r)(d/dr)(r dR/dr) ) / R ] + (2m/ħ²)(1/2) k r² = [ (1/(r² Φ)) d²Φ/dθ² ) ] - (2m/ħ²)(1/2) k 3 r² cos²θ + 2m E / ħ².

But this doesn’t separate neatly. The terms on the right still have r dependence through r², which is supposed to only appear on the left. So this approach might not work. Hence, perhaps variables aren’t separable in polar coordinates?

Hmm, maybe we need an alternative coordinate system. Suppose instead we use Cartesian coordinates. V(x,y) is then written as (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x², since cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x² / r², so 1/2 k r² + 3/2 k x². Then that gives:

V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2)k y² + (1/2 + 3/2)k x² = 2 k x² + (1/2)k y². Therefore, V(x,y) is 2 k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! In Cartesian coordinates, this potential is actually a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, where the x and y components have different spring constants. Thus, maybe bringing it into Cartesian coordinates simplifies the problem, and the separation is straightforward.

Wait a second, that is plausible. Let's check. Start with the potential expression:

Original in polar coordinates: V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Expressing in Cartesian coordinates, recognize that r² = x² + y². So:

V(x, y) = (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = ( (1/2)k + (3/2)k )x² + (1/2)k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Therefore, the potential is in the form of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in x and y directions: V(x, y) = ½ m ω_x² x² + ½ m ω_y² y². But in our case, the coefficient for x² is 2k, so ½ m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = 4k/m. Similarly, the coefficient for y² is (1/2)k, so ½ m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = k/m. Hence, ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m).

So, given that in Cartesian coordinates this is just a combination of two independent harmonic oscillators with frequencies ω_x and ω_y, the energy levels would be the sum of the energies from each oscillator. Therefore, in 2D, the energy is E = ħω_x(n_x + ½) + ħω_y(n_y + ½), where n_x, n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Plugging in ω_x and ω_y:

E = ħ*(2√(k/m))*(n_x + ½) + ħ*(√(k/m))*(n_y + ½). Factor out ħ√(k/m), which is the quantum of energy for the original isotropic oscillator with ω = √(k/m). Let's compute:

Let ω = √(k/m), so E can be written as ħω [2(n_x + ½) + (n_y + ½)] = ħω [2n_x + 1 + n_y + ½ ] = ħω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2]. Hence:

E = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2), with n_x, n_y = 0,1,2,...

Alternatively, this can be expressed as E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).

But let me confirm this transformation once more. If in the Cartesian coordinates, the potential is 2k x² + (1/2) k y², then the equivalent expressions for the angular frequencies are indeed ω_x = √( (2k)/(m) ) and ω_y = √( (k/2)/m ) ?

Wait wait, hold on, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check again:

The harmonic oscillator potential energy is ½ m ω_x² x². For the x-component, in our case: 2k x² = ½ m ω_x² x². Then solving for ω_x:

2k = ½ m ω_x² → ω_x² = 4k / m → ω_x = 2√(k/m). Similarly, for the y-component: ½ k y² which is equal to ½ m ω_y² y². Therefore, (1/2)k = ½ m ω_y² → ω_y² = k / m → ω_y = √(k / m). So that's as before.

Hence, indeed, in terms of energies when we quantize each direction, the x-direction harmonic oscillator has energy levels ħω_x (n_x + ½) and similarly for the y-direction. Therefore, total energy is:

E = ħω_x(n_x + ½) + ħω_y(n_y + ½ )

Plugging ω_x = 2√(k/m) and ω_y = √(k/m). But take note that ħω_x is 2ħ√(k/m), and ω_y is 1√(k/m). Let me express ω0 = √(k/m) as a common term. Then ω_x = 2ω0 and ω_y = ω0. So:

E = 2ħω0(n_x + ½) + ħω0(n_y + ½) = ħω0 [2(n_x + ½) + (n_y + ½)] = ħω0 [2n_x +1 +n_y + ½] = ħω0 [2n_x + n_y + 3/2].

Which matches the previous conclusion. So the energy spectrum is E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), with n_x and n_y being non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). This seems correct.

But I need to return to the original coordinates. The problem presents the potential in polar coordinates, so I just transformed it into Cartesian correctly and solved via known oscillator solutions. Since the potential in Cartesian ends up as 2k x² + (1/2)k y², leading to anisotropic oscillator, this suggests that the energy spectrum is derived straightforwardly from separation in x and y. So why didn't the potential seem to allow variable separation in polar coordinates? It probably can’t be easily separated in polar coordinates, but switching to Cartesian coordinates reveals a hidden separation which simplifies the problem significantly.

Moreover, this implies that the energy levels depend on two quantum numbers, n_x and n_y, as expected in Cartesian coordinates. However, traditionally, in polar coordinates, quantum numbers are linked to radial and angular modes, here n and m perhaps. But in this case, converting to Cartesian coordinates leads us just to consider separation into x and y, hence N_x and N_y.

Alternative way to see that: if in Cartesian coordinates, it's separable into x and y, so quantized as two independent oscillators. Hence, the overall wavefunction is a product of x and y oscillator eigenstates, and the energy is the sum of their energies.

Thus, the result seems correct, given the cross-check through multiple steps.

Hmm, but let me verify once more for mistakes in transformation. Suppose starting from original polar V(r,θ)= (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Then in Cartesian coordinates, V(x,y)= (1/2)k(x²+y²) + (3/2)k x² (since cosθ = x/r and r² = x² + y², so 3/2k x²). Let's compute:

(1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2k + 3/2k) x² + (1/2k)y² = (2k x²) + (0.5k y²) yeah, so that's correct.

Hence, the potential is twice the harmonic potential in x and half the harmonic potential in y. So with different frequencies. So energy for each direction is calculated separately, then summed.

Recall that for a 1D harmonic oscillator with potential V(x) = ½ m ω² x², the energy levels are E_n = ħ ω (n + ½). Here, for x-component:

The potential is 2k x², which is ½ m ω_x² x², and from before ω_x = 2√(k/m), yes, and energy levels in x: E_x = ħ ω_x(n_x + ½) = 2 ħ √(k/m) (n_x + ½ ). Similarly, for y-direction, V(y)=0.5k y² = ½ m ω_y² y² => ω_y= sqrt(k/m) as before. Then E_y= ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + ½ ).

Total Energy: E = E_x + E_y = 2ħ√(k/m)(n_x + ½ ) + ħ√(k/m )(n_y + ½ ). Then as before, factoring out ħ√(k/m):

E = ħ√(k/m)[ 2(n_x + ½ ) + (n_y + ½ ) ] = ħ√(k/m)( 2n_x +1 +n_y + ½ ) = ħ√(k/m) [2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ].

So the energy levels are E_{n_x,n_y} = ħω(2n_x +n_y +3/2 ), with ω=√(k/m). Thus each energy level is determined by two non-negative integers n_x and n_y. Even though the original problem was given in polar coordinates, transitioning to Cartesian separated variables, allowing the use of known harmonic oscillator solutions for each direction. Hence, the energy spectrum is obtained through summation of energies from each degree of freedom.

But, being an experienced problem-solver, perhaps I need to confirm if there's any other approach. For example, could the initial potential be treated as a standard central potential with an angular perturbation? In that case, perturbation theory might be relevant. However, if the transformation to Cartesian coordinates diagonalizes the potential into independent harmonic oscillators, then it's exact, which would be preferable.

Alternatively, checking for known potentials in 2D, maybe. Suppose if the potential doesn't separate in polar coordinates, but when transitioning to Cartesian and separating, leading to different oscillators... But do we need to worry about this going back to polar? Well, since once separated in different coordinates, the energy states convert into tensor products of x and y states, regardless of the original coordinates given. So I think this line of thought is consistent and correct.

Another check: Let's suppose k=0, in which case we have a free particle, but since k is non-zero here, we can't test the scenario. But k-traces back to both x and y components.

Alternatively, if the particle's Hamiltonian is in Cartesian coordinates,

H = (p_x² + p_y²)/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2) k y².

Clearly, this is separable into x and y components. So H = H_x + H_y, and within each part, H_x = p_x²/(2m) + 2k x², similarly H_y = p_y²/(2m) + (1/2)k y².

Hence, solving in Cartesian coordinates allows for easy variable separation, leading to separate quantum numbers in x and y. Then the energy spectra are additive.

Therefore, the solution is correct.

But in some textbooks, like the Landau-Lifshitz quantum mechanics, or other standard QM texts, 2D harmonic oscillators are treated. Indeed, when the frequencies are commensurate, other degeneracies arise, but here with ω_x = 2 ω_y (if ω_x is twice the ω_y; since in our case ω_x = 2√(k/m), ω_y = sqrt(k/m), so indeed ω_x = 2 ω_y), then certain degeneracies would occur. But for the purpose of finding the energy spectrum, these considerations pertain to the structure of the energy levels, which here we can just state in terms of separate quantum numbers.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2 n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). Alternatively, one can factor out the factor to get units.

Another way to write it would be: if we denote ω = sqrt(k/m), then E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2).

Alternatively, perhaps reorganize the terms:

E = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y ) + 3/2 ħ ω.

Alternatively, if we let n = 2n_x + n_y, then the energies would still depend on how n_x and n_y are combined, but because of the different coefficients, it's an alternating spectrum. However, the integers n_x and n_y can be 0,1,2,..., resulting in possible energies E_{n} in steps differing by ℏω.

Alternatively, if we substitute j = 2n_x + n_y, but j can take values 0,1,2,...

But n_x and n_y are independent. Let's try:

For example, fixing j = 2n_x +n_y.

If n_x =0, then j =0,1,2,3,... as n_y =0,1,2,…

If n_x =1, then 2 +0=2, 2+1=3, 2+2=4, etc.

Similarly, meaning for any j, n_x can be 0 to floor(j/2), and n_y =j - 2n_x.

Hence, each j corresponds to a set of (n_x, n_y) pairs. Therefore, the energy can be written as E = ħω(j + 3/2 ). But each j can be achieved in multiple ways with multiple (n_x, n_y), leading to each energy level E_j having a specific degeneracy. However, although that could be a valid way of representing the energy in terms of a single index j, the problem asks for the energy spectrum, which is the set of possible energy values. Since different combinations of (n_x, n_y) can give different j such that j =2n_x +n_y, then the energy spectrum can be parameterized either by (n_x, n_y) or by j. However, not all j values are possible unless additional conditions are met. For example, j must be an integer greater than or equal to 0. For each j, n_x can be 0 to floor(j/2), and n_y =j - 2n_x. Since n_y must be non-negative, this restricts n_x ≤ floor(j/2).

Wait: Explicitly, for given j, n_x can range from n_x=0 to n_x_max = floor( (j)/2 ). Then, number of states for each j would be n_x_max +1. For example, j=0: n_x=0, n_y=0. Only one state. j=1: n_x can only be 0 (since 2*1=2 >1), so n_x=0, n_y=1. So only one state. j=2: n_x can be 0 or1. n_x=0⇒n_y=2; n_x=1⇒n_y=0. Two states. Etc. Hence, dynastic degeneracy varies with j.

But regardless, the energy would be E = ħω(j + 3/2 ). Hence, possible energies at: ( ⌜ 3/2 ).

However, this introduces confusion. Since (even though for different j, there exist multiple (n_x, n_y)), the multiplicities change. But the energy levels have certain degeneracies. For answering the problem, given that the problem is self-standing and probably expects a simple expression, regardless of the coordinates.

Alternatively, write the spectrum in the original Cartesian variable-separated form, which is the sum of them. Therefore, the answer is as we had in prior steps: E_{n_x,n_y} = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x +n_y +3/2). Since the problem doesn’t specify expressing the energy levels in terms of a single (combined) quantum number, presumably the solution has two quantum numbers, and the energy is given in this combined way. Therefore, that (2n_x +n_y +3/2) might not be further simplified, but remains as is.

Alternatively, let me verify with a small transition.

Alternative representation: The energy is proportional to 2n_x +n_y, leading to Eigenvalues which are (with multiplier ħ√(k/m)) different for different combinations. However, perhaps listing this as the parametrized form for E, given that combination of n_x and n_y.

Alternatively, I can reflect on possible mistakes: E.g., In the step where we converted V into Cartesian, perhaps a miscalculation. Let's double-check:

Original Potential in polar: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Express as:

= (1/2)kr² [1 +3 cos²θ ].

When translating to cartesian coordinates, cosθ = x / sqrt(x² + y²). Hence, cos²θ = x²/(x² + y²). So plugging into V(r,θ):

V=(1/2)k(x²+y²) [1 +3(x²)/(x² + y²)] →

=[1/2 k (x² + y²) ] + [3/2 k x² ];

but wait, that would result in (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Let's check:

50% for x² + y² multiplying k and 150% for x² multiplying k.

Wait, in English: the potential is V(r,θ) = ½ k r² + ³⁄₂ k r² cos²θ. So group it:

= ½ k r² (1 + 3 cos²θ )

When converting to x,y (Cartesian):

= ½ k (x² + y²)(1 + 3 (x²/(x²+y²)))

= ½ k [ (x² + y² ) + 3x² ] 

Do the (x² + y² ) +3x² become 

x² + y² +3x² = 4x² + y². 

Multiplying all by ½ k:

Thus, V(x,y) = ½ k (4x² + y² ) = 2k x² + (1/2) k y².

Therefore, correct. So thus in x and y it's separate harmonic potentials with different strengths. Hence, confirming V is axially anisotropic, giving different frequencies for x , y.

Therefore the remaining steps are confirmed. Hence, the energy levels must have different contributions from x and y. Therefore, quantizing:

E_{n_x, n_y} =  (n_x + ½ )ħω_x + (n_y + ½ )ħω_y,

where ω_x = sqrt(stiffness_x/m). Now, revisiting this, the "stiffness" in x direction is V(x) = 2k x². In the case of harmonic oscillator, ½ m ω^2 x², so for x, comparing: 2k =1/2 m ω_x² ⇒ω_x =sqrt(4k/m)=2*sqrt(k/m).Similarly, V(y)=1/2* k y², so ½ k y²=½ m ω_y² y²⇒ω_y= sqrt(k/m).

Hence, replace ω_x and ω_y with sqrt(k/m), ω_x=2 sqrt(k/m), ω_y= sqrt(k/m).

Energy:

E = ħ*(2 sqrt(k/m))*(n_x +1/2 ) + ħ*sqrt(k/m)*(n_y + 1/2 ).

Factor out ħ*sqrt(k/m):

E = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x +1/2 ) + (n_y +1/2 ) ].

Simplify:

= ħ sqrt(k/m)[2n_x +1 + n_y +1/2 ]

= ħ sqrt(k/m)[2n_x +n_y +3/2 ].

This is in line with our previous conclusion. Therefore, the energy depends on the quantum numbers n_x and n_y. Hence, the answer should look like this.

But to write the final E in terms of m, k, hbar: Let's note that √(k/m) is ω_0 for the normal oscillator (for the y-direction). But given that:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ√(k/m)(2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )

But fractions in equations can be adjusted:

Alternatively, factor the ½ out.

E = ½ ħ√(k/m) [ 4n_x +2n_y +3 ].

But it's the same as before. Alternatively, done for writing fractions as... but no, existing form is simpler.

Let me think,  should I relate this to the principal quantum number or suggest the degeneracy?

No—just need the energy spectrum, which is the possible energy levels for any allowed n_x and n_y.

But the problem as stated:

‘‘‘A quantum mechanical particle of mass m moves in two dimensions in the following potential, as a function of (r,θ)’’’… so I think more context might be on potential’s form in polar coordinates, yet my solution note that a coordinate transform conceives a separation of variables and solve it via harmonic oscillators in Cartesian. So need to confirm that this approach is valid.

But given that in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is separable, and separable solutions exist with normalized wavefunctions, which are products of 1D harmonic oscillator states. Therefore,  this method is entirely acceptable and since in QM, choice of coordinates when solving SE must correlateto separability.

Then confidently, the energy spectrum is as derived above.

Therefore, put confidence points behind this conclusion.

Conclusion: Via transformation to Cartesian coordinates, energy spectrum rationally deduced as permutations of two harmonic oscillators, sum partaking coefficients leading to E = ħ√(k/m) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 ). Left with explanation suitable for a textbook answer.

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.
