**Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
**Reagent A: HCl**  
This reaction involves **cyanohydrin formation**. NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), and HCl protonates the carbonyl oxygen of butan-2-one, making it more electrophilic. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming an alkoxide intermediate, which is protonated by water to yield the hydroxyl group. The acid (HCl) ensures HCN is generated in situ to facilitate the nucleophilic addition.

**Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
**Reagent B: H₂SO₄ (or HCl) with heat**  
The nitrile group is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid under **acidic aqueous conditions**. Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) acts as a catalyst, and water facilitates the reaction. The mechanism involves protonation of the nitrile, nucleophilic attack by water, and tautomerization to form the carboxylic acid. Heat accelerates the hydrolysis process.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I've got these two organic chemistry reactions to figure out the reagents for. Let's tackle them one by one. Starting with the first one: butan-2-one reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, what's happening here? 

Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? The formula is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN usually relates to nucleophilic addition. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it can form a cyanohydrin. But wait, a cyanohydrin formation requires HCN, isn't it? But HCN is a weak acid, so maybe they're using NaCN along with an acid to generate HCN in situ? Or perhaps it's a different mechanism. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition where the cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon.

So butan-2-one has the carbonyl group at C2. If NaCN adds cyanide to the carbonyl, it would form an alkoxide intermediate which then protonates. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be: the nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin. Because in a cyanohydrin formation, you get addition of HCN across the carbonyl, leading to the hydroxyl and cyanide groups on the same carbon. 

So for cyanohydrin formation, typically you need HCN. But NaCN is a source of CN- and maybe you need an acid (like HCl or H2SO4) to protonate the intermediate. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Wait, but if you add NaCN (which is a salt) and then add an acid, you can generate HCN. So reagent A might be an acid, like HCl. Let me verify. When you add NaCN and H+ (from HCl, perhaps), you produce HCN, which can then perform the nucleophilic addition to the ketone. The carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, then the cyanide attacks, and then proton transfer occurs, followed by the hydroxyl group adding. Wait, but in the product, there's a hydroxyl and a nitrile on the same carbon. That's a cyanohydrin. So in that case, the typical reagent is HCN. So maybe reagent A is HCN. But sometimes, toxic HCN is avoided by using NaCN and an acid, like HCl. So perhaps reagent A is HCl. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe another approach. Maybe the reaction is a hydroxyalkylation? No, that might not fit. Let's consider the mechanism step by step. Butan-2-one has the structure (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- as a nucleophile would attack the carbonyl carbon, creating an alkoxide intermediate. Then, if this is protonated, you would have an alcohol (the hydroxyl group) and the nitrile. So in the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would be correct. So during the addition of CN- to the ketone, you form a cyanohydrin. But this typically requires HCN. However, HCN is a weak acid and doesn't dissociate completely, so using NaCN (which is a strong nucleophile) and then protonation somewhere.

Wait, maybe the reaction uses NaCN in a solution where the carbonyl is activated. For instance, in a basic or acidic condition? Ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition under certain conditions. Cyanide ion is a good nucleophile. So in the presence of NaCN, the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. Then the oxygen becomes O-, which can pick up a proton from water. Wait, but where does the -OH come from? If the alkoxide (O-) is protonated by water, that would give the -OH group. So maybe the reagent A is dilute acid or water? But in that case, maybe no additional reagent is needed apart from NaCN and aqueous conditions. Wait, in some cases, acetals formation requires acid catalysts, but that's for protection of carbonyl groups. For nucleophilic additions to ketones, maybe acid isn't necessary.

Wait, perhaps in this case, since we need both the -CN and -OH groups added to the same carbon, the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of HCN to the ketone. Since HCN can act as a nucleophile (providing CN-) and also provide a proton. But if we use HCN directly, but here the reagents mentioned are NaCN and A. So perhaps, A is HCl, which when reacted with NaCN produces HCN. Or maybe A is H2SO4 as a catalyst? Another idea: In some cases, reactions use HCN in a solution where it's generated in situ. For example, adding NaCN and then HCl would generate HCN. So here, NaCN plus HCl (as A) would form HCN, which then adds to the ketone. 

So the first step would be to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. The CN- attacks, forming the tetrahedral intermediate (alkoxide), which is then protonated to form the hydroxyl group. So, in this case, reagent A would be HCl. So A is HCl. That process makes sense. So reagent A is an acid like HCl. Then, when the acid is added to NaCN, HCN is formed in situ. So yes, the first reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + HCl → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile via cyanohydrin formation.

Moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with H2O (reagent B) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Okay, so this is a nitrile hydrolysis. Nitriles can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. Typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed in two steps: first to an amide and then to a carboxylic acid, or under more vigorous conditions, directly. For example, using a strong acid like HCl and heat would promote the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, like NaOH with heat. Wait, but the product here is a carboxylic acid. So if we do acidic hydrolysis, the nitrile would convert directly to a carboxylic acid. Whereas if we do basic hydrolysis, you first get a carboxylate anion, which would then need acid workup to get the acid. However, the question mentions that reagent B is H2O. So hydrolysis in water with some catalyst?

Wait, in some situations, nitriles can undergo hydrolysis in presence of an acid catalyst. For example, H2SO4, water, and heat. Or maybe using a transition metal catalyst. Another possible reagent is aqueous acid with heat. Also, nitriles can be hydrolyzed enzymatically, but that's not likely here. Let me get back. The starting material is a nitrile adjacent to a hydroxyl group. Maybe the structure is (4-benzylphenyl)–C(OH)(CH2CH3)CN. Hydrolyzing to the carboxylic acid would replace the CN with COOH. So nitrile to carboxylic acid. To do that, you might use HCl (aq), H2O, and heat. H2SO4 as a catalyst? Alternatively, using an aqueous base and then acidify? So maybe reagent B is aqueous HCl with heating. But the reaction here says reagent B is H2O. Wait, that's stated as reaction: ... + B (H2O) ... → butanoic acid.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. The problem states reagent B is H2O, but there's also a reagent. Maybe it's an acid. For example, H2O with H+ or H2SO4. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So, typical nitrile hydrolysis to acid requires acidic conditions, such as H3O+ (dil. H2SO4 or HCl) and heat. Alternatively, in basic conditions, producing the sodium carboxylate, which is then acidified. But since the product is the acid, likely the reagent B is an acid in water. So maybe B is aqueous H2SO4 with heat. So B would be HCl (aq) and heat, or a mixture. However, the way the problem is written, reagent B is H2O, so maybe water as the solvent with another acid catalyst. So most likely, for hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under acidic aqueous conditions. Thus the reagents are H2O and H+ (like H2SO4) and heat. But again, since reagent B is H2O, perhaps the formal reagent is, for example, H3O+ (dilute acid) and heat. Alternatively, maybe using a strong acid like concentrated HCl. 

Another thought: Maybe oxidation? No, nitriles are hydrolyzed, not oxidized. So in the second reaction, the reagent B is aqueous acid (like HCl, H2SO4) along with heat. But since it's stated that B is H2O, maybe B is more than just water, perhaps acidic water. For example, H2O with H2SO4. Alternatively, maybe just water under reflux. Wait, without acid or base, nitriles are generally not hydrolyzed. So the hydrolysis requires acid or base. Thus, B could be aqueous H2SO4 (as the acid in water) and heat. So in the reaction label, perhaps B is aqueous H+ (H3O+), such as H2SO4, HCl, etc. Given the problem lists B as (H2O), but that might refer to aqueous conditions, so the reagent is aqueous acid. Therefore, B would be a dilute acid like HCl or H2SO4 in water, under heat. Alternatively, some references mention that nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids can be achieved by heating with aqueous sodium hydroxide followed by acid work-up. But if the problem claims B is H2O, but usually it's in acid or base. Hmm.

Alternatively, is there another way to hydrolyze nitrile to carboxylic acid using a different reagent with water? Maybe using something like H2O2? Not sure. Another angle: Looking at the product, 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, hydrolysis of the nitrile to acid in presence of a neighboring hydroxyl group. Could there be some kind of hemiketal or protection involved? No, probably not here. The nitrile is in position 2, adjacent to hydroxyl. When we hydrolyze the nitrile to COOH, the hydroxyl group would remain as -OH. So in this case, the reaction is straightforward nitrile to carboxylic acid. Since both the starting material and product are chiral centers (if they are), but maybe not necessary here.

Therefore, going back, reagent B for converting nitrile to carboxylic acid in aqueous conditions would typically be a strong aqueous acid, like HCl (conc.) with heat. So for example, using 6M HCl and reflux. Therefore, B could be HCl (aq) and heat. But since the problem just mentions B as (H2O), maybe the acid is there as part of the aqueous solution. So formally, I would say reagent B is aqueous HCl (or H2SO4) with heat. But maybe the question just expects "H+/H2O" as the reagent. Alternatively, since it's written as (H2O), maybe it's a typo and they are expecting something else. But given that H2O is listed next to B in parentheses, probably that is part of the reagent, like B is H2O in presence of another acid. Wait, but reagents are cumulative here. So if the starting material is adding B (H2O) and seeing what's B. Maybe B is an acid catalyst in water. So maybe B is H2SO4 (dilute) or HCl, but since one of the reagents is H2O, and it's written as (H2O), maybe the answer is H+ (acid), but since that's ambiguous, maybe it's more precise.

Alternatively, in some textbooks, the hydrolysis of nitriles to acids is done using a two-step process: first H2O, HCl, then more HCl, or heating. Wait, it's possible that for beta-hydroxy nitriles, which this is (the nitrile is on a carbon adjacent to a hydroxyl group), the hydrolysis might occur under milder conditions. Because the hydroxyl group can participate in the mechanism, perhaps through some kind of neighboring group participation? I don't recall exactly, but beta-hydroxy nitriles can undergo hydrolysis more readily? Let's check. Often, beta-hydroxy nitriles can undergo hydrolysis to beta-hydroxy acids under acidic or basic conditions. For example, treating with sulfuric acid and water would likely protonate the nitrile, making it more electrophilic. Then water attacks, leading to an imidic acid intermediate, which then tautomerizes to the amide and is further hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if there's a hydroxyl group next to the nitrile, that might speed up the reaction (due to possible hemiacetal-like intermediates or hydrogen bonding?).

But whatever the mechanism, the key is that to convert nitrile to carboxylic acid, you need either acidic or basic conditions. Since in the problem reagent B is H2O, I think it's likely with acid catalyst. So reagent B is likely HCl (aq) and heat, or H2SO4 and heat. But the question might just accept "H2O, H+ and heat" as the answer. Since the question requires the selection of the suitable reagents, I need to match standard conditions. Commonly, for nitrile to acid hydrolysis, one can use either acidic conditions (like HCl with H2O) or basic conditions (like NaOH with H2O followed by acid workup). But since the product is the acid, not the carboxylate, likely acidic conditions.

Therefore, in the second reaction, reagent B is dilute HCl (aqueous HCl) under reflux. That's the usual condition. So reagent B is HCl, H2O, heat. But since the problem says reagent B is (H2O), but maybe B is HCl, and H2O is part of the aqueous solution. Possibly, B is "H3O+", but maybe the answer is HCl (or H2SO4) as the reagent.

Wait, per the problem's reaction notation: "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...". The (H2O) might be indicating that water is a solvent or part of the reagent. So reagent B plus water. Therefore reagent B is perhaps an acid or base. But in order to get the carboxylic acid product, reagent B is probably an acid (like HCl) in water. So the answer for B is HCl (or H2SO4) and water (which is present in the reaction as indicated).

Alternatively, perhaps it's aqueous sodium hydroxide. For example, under basic conditions, nitrile -> amide -> carboxylate (with NaOH), and then added acid to protonate. But that would involve two steps, but the question mentions only reagent B (H2O). Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses H2O under catalytic acidic conditions. Another thing, an alternative reagent for hydrolyzing nitriles is using Mercury(II) sulfate as a catalyst with sulfuric acid and water. But that's for propionitrile maybe. But it's less common. 

Alternatively, the Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution, but I think that's different. So the most straightforward answer is acidic hydrolysis. So reagent B is aqueous HCl with heat. Alternatively, since sodium cyanide is used in the first step, maybe the answer for the second step is to use H2O and H2SO4. In the context of the problem, perhaps the instructors accept "H2SO4, H2O, heat" or "HCl, H2O".

Putting it all together:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A (HCl) → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Here, A is HCl.

Second reaction: ... + B (H2O) → ...; but B needs to be H2SO4 or HCl (acid catalyst) in aqueous conditions, so likely B is aqueous H2SO4 with heat, or HCl. Maybe, but often answers use either acid. Perhaps "HCl (aq), heat" or "H2SO4 (aq), heat".

Considering standards, I think H2SO4 comes up often in acidic hydrolysis conditions. Alternatively, HCl. Let me confirm a textbook example. For example, conversion of nitrile to acid via acid hydrolysis: Nitrile is heated with a strong acid (like H2SO4 or HCl) and water. The reaction may require heating under reflux for several hours.

So, the answer for the first reagent is HCl (A), and the second is an acid catalyst (H2SO4 or HCl) in water. However, given that part B is in parentheses with H2O, I think reagent B might be dilute sulfuric acid. Alternatively, if they follow the first part of NaCN and HCl, then the second might be HCl and H2O again. But the problem lists B as (H2O), so perhaps the reagent is HCl aqueous. Therefore, reagent B is HCl (or H2SO4) with H2O. The question asks to select the suitable reagents, probably expecting standard ones. Let's summarize.

For reaction 1: The addition of HCN to ketone to form cyanohydrin. Since NaCN is used, A is HCl. Because NaCN + HCl → HCN + NaCl. Then, the HCN attacks the ketone.

Reaction 2: Hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Acidic conditions. Therefore, B is aqueous HCl (or H2SO4) with heat. Therefore, writing "HCl, H2O" for B.

So, final answers:

First reaction: A is HCl

Second reaction: B is H2SO4 (or HCl), but given the prompt says B (H2O), maybe specifying acidic water. In some textbooks, acid-catalyzed hydrolysis may use H3O+ as a reagent, but for testing purposes, likely expects H3O+ (e.g., dilute sulfuric acid) or HCl. Alternatively, the answer might simply be H2O and acid. But considering how the question is presented, maybe reagent B is HCl (since H2O is already part of the reaction), so wrote HCl as reagent B. But in the problem statement, when B is used, it's "B (H2O)", which could indicate that B itself is water. But that can't be; the hydrolysis of nitrile to acid requires more than just water. Therefore, maybe reagent B is aqueous HCl. Alternatively, someone could say H3O+.

But considering that answers often use specific reagents, it's likely:

A is HCl and B is H2SO4, H2O, heat.

But both HCl in A and HCl in B are possible. Alternatively, H2SO4. I need to check if having HCl in both steps is consistent. For the first step, since NaCN is used, adding HCl will generate HCN, as HCN is needed for the cyanohydrin. Then for the hydrolysis, we require H+ to protonate the nitrile.

Given that the question is of a basic level, often, in such cases, for cyanohydrin, they use NaCN and HCl (since HCN is generated in situ). For hydrolysis of nitrile to acid, you can use HCl, H2O and heat.

Therefore, the answer I will put is:

Reaction 1: A = HCl

Reaction 2: B = H2O (with H2SO4 or HCl under heat, but since the reagent is stated as B with H2O in parenthesis, probably dilute acid. So, the reagents for B are aqueous H2SO4 and heat. But the problem might just take B as H2SO4.)

Wait, considering that water is already indicated in B with the parenthesis, then the reagent B is H+ (for example H2SO4 or HCl). But since in reaction notation you might only write "H2O" as in aqueous, but actually the reactive reagent is the acid. So maybe for B, H2SO4 is the reagent. Alternatively, if they only want the name of the reagent added along with H2O, then for example H2SO4. 

Alternatively, to hydrolyze nitrile to the acid, possible reagents are concentrated hydrochloric acid (which is aqueous HCl) with heat.

Assuming both need acid:

Reaction 1: HCl

Reaction 2: H2SO4 (or HCl)

Since the problem pairs B with H2O, it's expected that B is an aqueous acid, perhaps H2SO4. But maybe just H+ sources. Alternatively, maybe the Reimer-Tiemann reaction, but that's for phenolic compounds.

In conclusion, after this extensive thinking, my answers are:

A is HCl (for the cyanohydrin formation using NaCN and HCl to generate HCN in situ).

B is H2SO4 (used in aqueous conditions with heat to hydrolyze the nitrile to the carboxylic acid).\

Okay, so I've got these two organic chemistry reactions to figure out the reagents for. Let's tackle them one by one. Starting with the first one: butan-2-one reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, what's happening here? 

Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? The formula is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN usually relates to nucleophilic addition. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it can form a cyanohydrin. But wait, a cyanohydrin formation requires HCN, isn't it? But HCN is a weak acid, so maybe they're using NaCN along with an acid to generate HCN in situ? Or perhaps it's a different mechanism. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition where the cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon.

So butan-2-one has the carbonyl group at C2. If NaCN adds cyanide to the carbonyl, it would form an alkoxide intermediate which then protonates. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be: the nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin. Because in a cyanohydrin formation, you get addition of HCN across the carbonyl, leading to the hydroxyl and cyanide groups on the same carbon. 

So for cyanohydrin formation, typically you need HCN. But NaCN is a source of CN- and maybe you need an acid (like HCl or H2SO4) to protonate the intermediate. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Wait, but if you add NaCN (which is a salt) and then add an acid, you can generate HCN. So reagent A might be an acid, like HCl. Let me verify. When you add NaCN and H+ (from HCl, perhaps), you produce HCN, which can then perform the nucleophilic addition to the ketone. The carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, then the cyanide attacks, and then proton transfer occurs, followed by the hydroxyl group adding. Wait, but in the product, there's a hydroxyl and a nitrile on the same carbon. That's a cyanohydrin. So in that case, the typical reagent is HCN. So maybe reagent A is HCN. But sometimes, toxic HCN is avoided by using NaCN and an acid, like HCl. So perhaps reagent A is HCl. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe another approach. Maybe the reaction is a hydroxyalkylation? No, that might not fit. Let's consider the mechanism step by step. Butan-2-one has the structure (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- as a nucleophile would attack the carbonyl carbon, creating an alkoxide intermediate. Then, if this is protonated, you would have an alcohol (the hydroxyl group) and the nitrile. So in the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That would be correct. So during the addition of CN- to the ketone, you form a cyanohydrin. But this typically requires HCN. However, HCN is a weak acid and doesn't dissociate completely, so using NaCN (which is a strong nucleophile) and then protonation somewhere.

Wait, maybe the reaction uses NaCN in a solution where the carbonyl is activated. For instance, in a basic or acidic condition? Ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition under certain conditions. Cyanide ion is a good nucleophile. So in the presence of NaCN, the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. Then the oxygen becomes O-, which can pick up a proton from water. Wait, but where does the -OH come from? If the alkoxide (O-) is protonated by water, that would give the -OH group. So maybe the reagent A is dilute acid or water? But in that case, maybe no additional reagent is needed apart from NaCN and aqueous conditions. Wait, in some cases, acetals formation requires acid catalysts, but that's for protection of carbonyl groups. For nucleophilic additions to ketones, maybe acid isn't necessary.

Wait, perhaps in this case, since we need both the -CN and -OH groups added to the same carbon, the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of HCN to the ketone. Since HCN can act as a nucleophile (providing CN-) and also provide a proton. But if we use HCN directly, but here the reagents mentioned are NaCN and A. So perhaps, A is HCl, which when reacted with NaCN produces HCN. Or maybe A is H2SO4 as a catalyst? Another idea: In some cases, reactions use HCN in a solution where it's generated in situ. For example, adding NaCN and then HCl would generate HCN. So here, NaCN plus HCl (as A) would form HCN, which then adds to the ketone. 

So the first step would be to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. The CN- attacks, forming the tetrahedral intermediate (alkoxide), which is then protonated t

"I'm working on determining the reagents for two organic chemistry reactions. Let's examine the first one: butan-2-one reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and an unknown reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is a ketone with the formula (CH3)2CO. When considering NaCN's role, I think about nucleophilic addition reactions. Typically, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it can form a cyanohydrin. However, cyanohydrin formation usually requires HCN, not just NaCN. Since HCN is a weak acid, perhaps the reaction uses NaCN with an acid to generate HCN in situ.

Looking at the product 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, I can see it has both a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon atom, which matches the structure of a cyanohydrin. This supports my thinking that cyanohydrin formation is occurring.

In the mechanism, the cyanide ion from NaCN would attack the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one, creating an alkoxide intermediate. This intermediate would then need to be protonated to form the hydroxyl group in the final product. For this protonation step, an acid would be needed.

So reagent A might be an acid like HCl or H2SO4. When NaCN interacts with an acid, it generates HCN, which can then participate in the nucleophilic addition to the ketone. The carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic, followed by cyanide attack, proton transfer, and hydroxyl group addition.

Alternatively, reagent A could be water or a dilute acid solution that provides the proton source for the alkoxide intermediate. However, since cyanohydrin formation typically requires HCN, and we're using NaCN, it seems most likely that reagent A is an acid that helps generate HCN in situ.

In summary, for this first reaction, reagent A is likely an acid such as HCl or H2SO4 that works with NaCN to facilitate cyanohydrin formation through nucleophilic addition to the ketone."

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I've got two organic chemistry reactions that I need to determine the reagents for. Let's address them one at a time. We'll begin with the first reaction: butan-2-one is reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and another reagent, referred to as reagent A, to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. What's going on in this scenario?

Butan-2-one is a ketone, correct? Its molecular formula is (CH3)2CO. The addition of NaCN usually involves a nucleophilic addition reaction. I recall that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, a cyanohydrin can form. However, the formation of a cyanohydrin typically requires HCN, right? Given that HCN is a weak acid, perhaps the idea is to use NaCN along with an acid to produce HCN in situ, or maybe it's an alternate mechanism. Alternatively, it could be a nucleophilic addition where the cyanide ion attaches to the carbonyl carbon.

In butan-2-one, the carbonyl group is at the C2 position. When NaCN adds the cyanide ion to the carbonyl, an alkoxide intermediate is formed, which then becomes protonated. However, the final product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, where both the nitrile and hydroxyl groups are located on the same carbon. This aligns with the formation of a cyanohydrin. During cyanohydrin formation, HCN adds across the carbonyl, resulting in the nitrile and hydroxyl groups falling on the same carbon.

Typically, you'd use HCN for cyanohydrin formation. Nevertheless, NaCN supplies CN─, and an acid (like HCl or H2SO4) might be needed for intermediate protonation. Alternatively, the reaction could occur under acidic conditions. If NaCN, a salt, is added alongside an acid, HCN might be generated. Therefore, reagent A could be an acid like HCl. It's worth considering. By introducing NaCN along with H+ from HCl, HCN is produced, which can then engage in the nucleophilic addition to the ketone. The carbonyl oxygen gets protonated, enhancing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, which the cyanide then attacks, leading to proton transfer and the formation of the hydroxyl. Still, a hydroxyl and nitrile group are situated on the same carbon in the product, which is typical for cyanohydrins. Thus, HCN is the standard reagent, but for safety reasons, toxic HCN might be avoided by using NaCN and an acid like HCl. Thus, reagent A could very well be HCl.

Alternatively, let's explore another possibility. Could the reaction involve hydroxyalkylation? That doesn’t seem right. Let's dissect the mechanism again. Butan-2-one has the (CH3)2CO structure. Adding CN─ as a nucleophile would result in an attack on the carbonyl carbon, yielding an alkoxide intermediate. Upon protonation, you would obtain an alcohol (the hydroxyl group) and a nitrile, resulting in the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is consistent. During CN─ addition to the ketone, a cyanohydrin forms, typically with HCN, but due to HCN’s weak acidic nature, complete dissociation is unlikely, hence employing NaCN (a potent nucleophile) and subsequent protonation.

Maybe the reaction utilizes NaCN in conditions that activate the carbonyl. Either basic or acidic environments might accomplish this. Ketones are amenable to nucleophilic addition under certain conditions. With NaCN available, CN─ readily attacks the carbonyl carbon. The resultant O─ can procure a proton from water. But where does the -OH come from? If the alkoxide (O─) is protonated by water, it forms the -OH group. Thus, reagent A might be a dilute acid or water. But maybe, beyond NaCN and water, no additional reagents are necessary. Occasionally, acid catalysts aid in acetal formation for carbonyl group protection, but for nucleophilic additions to ketones, acid might not be a prerequisite.

Still, considering that both -CN and -OH need to add to the same carbon, the reaction could entail HCN’s nucleophilic addition to the ketone. Acting both as a nucleophile (offering CN─) and a proton source, HCN fits, especially if used directly. However, given NaCN and a component A, potentially A is HCl, generating HCN upon reaction with NaCN. Alternatively, A might be H2SO4 as a catalyst. Another possibility: sometimes reactions proceed with HCN generated in situ. For example, mixing NaCN with HCl yields HCN, which then reacts with the ketone. 

The initial step would involve carbonyl oxygen protonation, increasing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. The CN─ attacks, forming the tetrahedral intermediate (alkoxide), subsequently protonated to achieve the desired product.

So in that case, reagent A is likely to be an acid, like HCl. So, for the first reaction, Reagent A is HCl. Let me verify with an example. For instance, in the formation of cyanohydrins from ketones, HCN is typically used, but when using NaCN, an acid is needed. For example, sodium cyanide and hydrochloric acid would generate HCN. Therefore, the correct reagent A is HCl.\n\nMoving on to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The reagent here is H2O (as B is in water), but typically, nitrile to carboxylic acid requires acidic or basic hydrolysis. Nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions (like H2SO4, heat) or basic conditions (like NaOH, heat). However, the product here is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, so you have the hydroxyl group retained. Let me think about the hydrolysis of cyanohydrin. Wait, when a cyanohydrin (which has adjacent hydroxyl and nitrile groups) undergoes hydrolysis, what happens?\n\nUnder acidic conditions, the nitrile group can be hydrolyzed. The process for converting nitrile to carboxylic acid typically requires strong acid or base and heat. But maybe in this case, since there\'s an adjacent hydroxyl group, perhaps the hydrolysis is under mild acidic conditions? Alternatively, the presence of the hydroxyl group might direct the hydration. Wait, but how? A nitrile group hydrolyzing to carboxylic acid generally needs stronger conditions, like H2O with H2SO4 and heat, or using a base like NaOH with heating. The product in this case is a carboxylic acid, which forms under acidic conditions, whereas under basic conditions, it would form the carboxylate salt. Since the problem says the product is a carboxylic acid, reagent B is H2O (maybe combined with acid, like H3O+). But since the given reagent is B (H2O), maybe there is more to it. Alternatively, they might want H+ as a catalyst. Wait, but the scenario describes reagent B as H2O. Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis in H2O alone won\'t do much—it requires a catalyst.\n\nAlternatively, if B is aqueous acid (like H2SO4, H2O, heat), then the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, the step may require an acidic workup. Wait, considering that starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group adjacent. Maybe it\'s a case of nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid via the intermediate amide. But maybe under milder conditions if the -OH is present for the hydrolysis.\n\nWait, in an acidic hydrolysis, nitrile → amide → carboxylic acid. But maybe in this scenario, it\'s more straightforward. Since nitrile to carboxylic acid is typically H3O+ and heat. So reagent B is H2O with an acid catalyst (like H2SO4) and heat. But since the problem says the reagent is B (H2O), maybe B is H2O under acidic conditions. However, the way the problem is written: "+ B (H2O)"—it might indicate that the reagent is aqueous acid. But without more specifics, maybe the correct answer for B is aqueous sulfuric acid and heat, but maybe it\'s dilute HCl in water. But given that only the second reagent is specified as H2O in the problem, and B is part of that reaction. Wait, the problem says "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid". So, reagent B might be H3O+ (aqueous acid) with heating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they\'re using a specific enzymatic hydrolysis, but that\'s probably too much. Let me think again: converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid under aqueous acidic conditions with heat. So for hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid, you typically add aqueous HCl or H2SO4 and heat. Since the problem says B is H2O, but in reality, water alone isn\'t sufficient. So perhaps in the context of the question, B is aqueous acid (like H2SO4 and water), and they just write B as H2O. But the problem format is perhaps providing B as part of the reagents. Wait, the way the problem is structured, reaction 1 uses NaCN and A, reaction 2 uses B (H2O). But if reaction 2\'s reagent is H2O, but without adding acid or base, it seems unlikely to hydrolyze the nitrile. So maybe B is H2O with something else? The question is worded as "B (H2O)" which is a bit ambiguous. Perhaps I should infer that B is aqueous acid, like H2O with H+ as a catalyst.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hydrolysis is happening via a different pathway because of the adjacent hydroxyl group. Like, perhaps it\'s an example of a Hyberamide reaction or something else. Wait, neighboring group participation. If the hydroxide is adjacent, maybe it can assist in the hydrolysis. For example, the hydroxyl group could act as an internal nucleophile. Wait, but nitriles are pretty stable. Alternative path: Maybe the nitrile is first converted to an amide in acidic conditions, then to carboxylic acid. However, without strong acidic conditions, that might not proceed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s a tautomerism. No, but the starting material is a nitrile. Maybe under basic conditions with H2O, but converting to carboxylic acid requires acidic conditions for protonation. Hmm. \n\nWait, when nitrile hydrolyzes in aqueous acid with heat, the steps are: nitrile → amide → carboxylic acid. So requires H2O and H+ (like H2SO4 or HCl) and heat. So B is likely aq. HCl (or H2SO4) with heating. But the problem says B is H2O, so maybe it\'s aqueous acid, but the heat is implied. In exams, sometimes they write H3O+ as the reagent. Alternatively, in the first reaction, maybe the A is aqueous HCl, and the second B is aqueous HCl as well but it\'s already written as (H2O). Hmm, perhaps the problem is designed to see that the first reaction uses HCN (hence A is HCN), but generated from NaCN and HCl. While the second uses acidic hydrolysis (H2O with HCl or H2SO4). Alternatively, wait, in the product, the hydroxyl group is still present. So in that case, we must have had hydrolysis that didn\'t affect the hydroxyl group. So acidic hydrolysis would protonate the hydroxyl? Well, maybe not. If acidic hydrolysis conditions are used, like H2SO4, H2O, heat, which would hydrolyze the nitrile without affecting the hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl is already present as a hydroxyl. \n\nTherefore, for the second reaction, the correct reagent B, considering H2O is part of the reagent, but I would think B is aqueous acid (like HCl or H2SO4) under heat. But since the reaction states B (H2O), perhaps in the context of this problem, they\'re just using H2O with an acid catalyst, but the problem abbreviates it as B (H2O). So maybe the answer is H2O and H2SO4 (heat) or just H3O+/H2O. Let me check some references. For example, typical hydrolysis of a nitrile to carboxylic acid is done with either strong acid (like HCl) and heat, or strong base (NaOH) and heat, then acidified. But since the product here is a carboxylic acid, not a carboxylate, the reaction would likely use acidic conditions. Therefore, reagent B is likely dilute H2SO4 (or HCl) and water with heat. But the problem mentions that B is H2O. Unless they consider H2O as reagent B in the presence of acid. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction uses an enzyme, but that\'s not typical.\n\nWait, another angle: In the presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to a nitrile, maybe the hydrolysis is mediated by something else. Wait, in acidic conditions, maybe the adjacent hydroxyl could form a hemiacetal or something that assists hydrolysis. But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile undergoes hydration to form an amide, then further hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.\n\nBut regardless of the mechanism, the conventional reagent to go from nitrile to carboxylic acid is hot aqueous acid (like H2SO4) or hot aqueous base followed by acid workup. Since the problem gives B (H2O), but with nitriles needing acid for hydrolysis, I think B would be H3O+ (aq. HCl or H2SO4) under heat. So the second reagent is likely aqueous HCl with heat, abbreviated here as B (H2O). Alternatively, it\'s possible that the question is expecting H+ (acid) with water. So perhaps the reagents are A: HCl (for the first reaction, as a source of H+ to protonate the cyanide), and for the second reaction, B: H2O (with acid and heat, but labeled just as H2O. But in a standard exam setting, they might expect: Reagent A is HCl (for the first reaction), and Reagent B is H2SO4, H2O, heat. However, given as in the problem. Maybe the answer they expect is:\n\nFor the first reaction, A is HCl (to protonate the cyanide and form HCN), leading to the cyanohydrin.\n\nFor the second reaction, B is H2O with an acid catalyst, such as H2SO4 and heat. But the way it\'s phrased "B (H2O)" might just be aqueous acid. Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when converting nitrile to carboxylic acid, H2O is used with a catalyst. But perhaps nitrile to carboxylic acid is a hydrolysis requiring H2O, so in this case, B is H2O with an acid (like HCl or H2SO4). Therefore, I think for the second reaction, reagent B is aqueous sulfuric acid and heat. However, sometimes, in certain textbooks, this might be written as H2O (with an acid catalyst). Therefore, based on what\'s usually expected: Reagent 1 is HCl (acid) to protonate and form HCN from NaCN, Reagent 2 is H2O with H2SO4 (heat). But the problem mentions B as (H2O). That could indicate that B is simply H2O, which is probably not. Alternatively, maybe the first step uses HCN, so reagent A is H2O? No, because sodium cyanide and acid would be the way. Hmm. Maybe I need to look up some standard reagents for forming cyanohydrin and hydrolysis of nitriles.\n\nFormation of cyanohydrin: typically HCN or NaCN with a weak acid (like acetic acid) or NaCN with H2SO4? Wait, when NaCN is used, sometimes a protic acid is added to release HCN. For example, adding HCl would make HCN. However, this can be dangerous because HCN is toxic. So reagent A is HCl.\n\nHydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid: requires acidic or basic conditions. For acidic, the reagents would be concentrated HCl or H2SO4, water, heat. For example, in acidic conditions, dilute H2SO4 and heat. So in that case, the reagent B is aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4, H2O) and heat. Therefore, putting all together: For reaction 1, A is HCl; For reaction 2, B is H2SO4 in H2O (but the problem states "B (H2O)", so maybe B is dilute H2SO4).\n\nBut given that the problem specifies "(H2O)" for reagent B, maybe the reagent is essentially aqueous acid. So if they don\'t require specifying the acid but assume it\'s present, which is common. Alternatively, perhaps the B is just aqueous H2SO4, and since H2O is the solvent, they mention it as (H2O). However, in some references, nitrile to carboxylic acid hydrolysis is written as H3O+ or H+/H2O.\n\nBut putting it all together, the reagents should be:\n\nA) HCl (to generate HCN for cyanohydrin formation)\n\nB) H2O with H2SO4 (or other strong acid) and heat.\n\nBut the way the problem is written, is there any standard abbreviation for these? The first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to form a cyanohydrin. The key reagent here is HCN, which is generated in situ by using NaCN and HCl. So, technically, reagent A is HCl. For the second reaction, the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid requires acidic conditions. The reagent is aqueous acid (H2SO4 or HCl) with heat, which since they mention B as (H2O), perhaps the answer is just H2O and they assume acidic conditions. But in academic settings, they might specify the acid. Since the question lists B as (H2O), maybe B is H3O+, which is H+ (aq). For example, in the answer, reagent B could be H3O+/H2O or aqueous HCl. However, since they specify that B is (H2O), perhaps it\'s just H2O. But realistically, I think there\'s an error here. But it\'s probably expected that reagent B is H2SO4 in H2O and heat. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the structure again: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Since there\'s a hydroxyl adjacent to the nitrile group, maybe the hydrolysis doesn\'t require a strong acid. But I don\'t recall such a reaction adjacent hydroxyl affects the nitrile hydrolysis. So the reagent B is probably aqueous acid (H2SO4 or HCl) with heat. Since nitriles are pretty stubborn, they need strong conditions. \n\nTherefore, to answer the problem: \n\nReaction 1: NaCN + HCl (A) → forms HCN in situ for the cyanohydrin.\n\nReaction 2: Hydrolysis with H2O and acid (sulfuric acid), but the problem lists B as H2O. So likely, the answer requires "dilute H2SO4" or just "H2O/H+", but since the problem specifies B as H2O, maybe auto-induced? No. Alternatively, if the reaction uses water with acid as a catalyst but the solvent is H2O, perhaps the answer is "dilute sulfuric acid" or "HCl (aq)". In exams, sometimes होता. Well, to sum up:\n\nFirst reaction: A is HCl (so sodium cyanide and HCl give HCN, which adds to the ketone forming the cyanohydrin).\n\nSecond reaction: B is acidic water (like H2SO4 in H2O) with heating.\n\nBut since the problem lists B as (H2O), probably they accept something like H3O+ or aqueous HCl. So if the options are given as reagent A and B, in some contexts, the answer would be:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H3O+ (dilute acid) with heat.\n\nBut given the way the question is structured, without more options, safest answers are:\n\nFor the first reaction: A = HCl (to generate HCN in situ for the cyanohydrin formation)\n\nSecond reaction: B = H2O with H2SO4 (or another strong acid), heat. But as the second reagent is simply given as B (H2O), maybe the problem is expecting just H2O. But that’s ambiguous. If so, in the reaction conditions, water is necessary, but then you need an acid catalyst. But if I think nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid requires aqueous acid, then B would be H2O with an acid.\n\nAlternativelymaybe anion hydrolysis. But in any case, the textbook answer likely expects:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H2SO4, H2O, heat\n\nBut the way B is mentioned as + B (H2O), perhaps the formal answer is:\n\nReaction 1: Reagent A is HCl\n\nReaction 2: Reagent B is H2O (with H2SO4 as a catalyst and heat), which they just indicate with H2O.\n\nHence, depending on standard answer expectations, the answers are:\n\nA = HCl\n\nB = H2O (with H2SO4, heat)\n\nBut maybe since the user didn\'t specify the format beyond selecting from given, maybe the answers are HCl for A and H2O (aqueous acidic conditions, which might be implied with H2O). However, possible for B to be H3O+.\n\nWait the user instruction says "Select the suitable reagents..." which implies these are named reagents.\n\nIn a стандартном синтезе:\n\nFor the first reaction, combining a ketone with NaCN and an acid to form a cyanohydrin. That makes HCl the acid.\n\nFor the second reaction, hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid in acidic conditions. So, reagent B would be H2O in presence of H2SO4 or HCl. But since they mentioned the reagent is B (H2O), perhaps it\'s H2O with acid and heat. However, given in shorthand, the reagent is H3O+ (aq) maybe. Alternatively, the B is aqueous sulfuric acid. But perhaps in the context of a typical exam question:\n\nReagent A is HCl (since forming HCN from NaCN requires H+)\n\nReagent B is H2SO4, H2O, heat.\n\nBut again, since the original question writes B as (H2O), perhaps the B is simply H+ (aq), but common answers for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid are H3O+ or dilute H2SO4/HCl with heat. Alternatively, in some books, it\'s written as "H2O, H+".\n\nSo, the most precise answers based on typical reagent usage:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H2O/H2SO4, heat\n\nBut since the user presents reagents as A and B, maybe their exact answers are HCl for A and H2O with H2SO4 as B, but depending on formatting. Given that the user is prompting with "B (H2O)", I think they\'re expecting that B is aqueous acid. So, compiling everything, I think:\n\nFirst reaction: HCl is reagent A.\n\nSecond reaction: H2O with an acid (like H2SO4) is reagent B.\n\nBut given that in the second reaction it\'s written as "+ B (H2O)", it\'s possible they are considering H2O as the reagent and that the nitrile hydrolysis is performed in water with some catalyst. However, in standard problems, such reagents are typically noted as aqueous acid. Therefore, the answer likely expects:\n\nA: HCl or HCN. But using NaCN, so they want HCl.\n\nB: H2O and H2SO4 (acidic hydrolysis)\n\nBut maybe symbolically, assuming standard,  2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid is formed from nitrile via acidic hydrolysis.\n\nSo concluding, the answers would be:\n\nA: HCl\n\nB: H2SO4, H2O (heat)\n\nBut more precisely as per question formatting, reagent B is H2O (with implied acidic conditions), or reagent B is H3O+.\n\n Acknowledging possible variations, but given the problem statement, the answers should be:\n\nA = HCl\n\nB = H2SO4 (aqueous) and heat. But since written as B (H2O), maybe B is H3O+, but that\'s your choice. But HCl is for A. As per most textbooks 답변은.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nReagent A is HCl for the first step.\n\nReagent B is H2SO4, H2O, and heat for the second step. But given the user requires the answer in the specified format with boxes, let me get that done.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nFor the first reaction, the suitable reagent A is \\boxed{HCl}.  \nFor the second reaction, the suitable reagent B is \\boxed{H_2SO_4} (with water and heat).\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743844562, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4666, prompt_tokens=1173, total_tokens=5839, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the suitable reagents for the given reactions:

1. **Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
   This reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone. The ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and an acid to generate HCN in situ. The acid (HCl) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion. The resulting intermediate is protonated to form the cyanohydrin (2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile).  
   **Reagent A**: \boxed{HCl}

2. **Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
   This reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The nitrile group (-CN) is converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH) under acidic conditions. The presence of an adjacent hydroxyl group does not affect the hydrolysis mechanism. The reaction requires an acid catalyst (such as H2SO4) and heat to proceed.

 o form the cyanohydrin. So in that case, reagent A is likely to be an acid, like HCl. So, for the first reaction, Reagent A is HCl. Let me verify with an example. For instance, in the formation of cyanohydrins from ketones, HCN is typically used, but when using NaCN, an acid is needed. For example, sodium cyanide and hydrochloric acid would generate HCN. Therefore, the correct reagent A is HCl.

Moving on to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The reagent here is H2O (as B is in water), but typically, nitrile to carboxylic acid requires acidic or basic hydrolysis. Nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids under acidic conditions (like H2SO4, heat) or basic conditions (like NaOH, heat). However, the product here is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, so you have the hydroxyl group retained. Let me think about the hydrolysis of cyanohydrin.

But given that the problem specifies "(H2O)" for reagent B, maybe the reagent is essentially aqueous acid. So if they don't require specifying the acid but assume it's present, which is common. Alternatively, perhaps the B is just aqueous H2SO4, and since H2O is the solvent, they mention it as (H2O). However, in some references, nitrile to carboxylic acid hydrolysis is written as H3O+ or H+/H2O.

But putting it all together, the reagents should be:

A) HCl (to generate HCN for cyanohydrin formation)

B) H2O with H2SO4 (or other strong acid) and heat.

But the way the problem is written, is there any standard abbreviation for these? The first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to form a cyanohydrin. The key reagent here is HCN, which is generated in situ by using NaCN and HCl. So, technically, reagent A is HCl. For the second reaction, the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid requires acidic conditions. The reagent is aqueous acid (H2SO4 or HCl) with heat, which since they mention B as (H2O), perhaps the answer is just H2O and they assume acidic conditions. But in academic settings, they might specify the acid. Since the question lists B as (H2O), maybe B is H3O+, which is H+ (aq). For example, in the answer, reagent B could be H3O+/H2O or aqueous HCl. However, since they specify that B is (H2O), perhaps it's just H2O. But realistically, I think there's an error here. But it's probably expected that reagent B is H2SO4 in H2O and heat. 

Alternatively, looking at the structure again: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Since there's a hydroxyl adjacent to the nitrile group, maybe the hydrolysis doesn't require a strong acid. But I don't recall such a reaction adjacent hydroxyl affects the nitrile hydrolysis. So the reagent B is probably aqueous acid (H2SO4 or HCl) with heat. Since nitriles are pretty stubborn, they need strong conditions. 

Therefore, to answer the problem: 

Reaction 1: NaCN + HCl (A) → forms HCN in situ for the cyanohydrin.

Reaction 2: Hydrolysis with H2O and acid (sulfuric acid), but the problem lists B as H2O. So likely, the answer requires "dilute H2SO4" or just "H2O/H+", but since the problem specifies B as H2O, maybe auto-induced? No. Alternatively, if the reaction uses water with acid as a catalyst but the solvent is H2O, perhaps the answer is "dilute sulfuric acid" or "HCl (aq)". In exams, sometimes होता. Well, to sum up:

First reaction: A is HCl (so sodium cyanide and HCl give HCN, which adds to the ketone forming the cyanohydrin).

Second reaction: B is acidic water (like H2SO4 in H2O) with heating.

But since the problem lists B as (H2O), probably they accept something like H3O+ or aqueous HCl. So if the options are given as reagent A and B, in some contexts, the answer would be:

A: HCl

B: H3O+ (dilute acid) with heat.

But given the way the question is structured, without more options, safest answers are:

For the first reaction: A = HCl (to generate HCN in situ for the cyanohydrin formation)

Second reaction: B = H2O with H2SO4 (or another strong acid), heat. But as the second reagent is simply given as B (H2O), maybe the problem is expecting just H2O. But that’s ambiguous. If so, in the reaction conditions, water is necessary, but then you need an acid catalyst. But if I think nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid requires aqueous acid, then B would be H2O with an acid.

Alternativelymaybe anion hydrolysis. But in any case, the textbook answer likely expects:

A: HCl

B: H2SO4, H2O, heat

But the way B is mentioned as + B (H2O), perhaps the formal answer is:

Reaction 1: Reagent A is HCl

Reaction 2: Reagent B is H2O (with H2SO4 as a catalyst and heat), which they just indicate with H2O.

Hence, depending on standard answer expectations, the answers are:

A = HCl

B = H2O (with H2SO4, heat)

But maybe since the user didn't specify the format beyond selecting from given, maybe the answers are HCl for A and H2O (aqueous acidic conditions, which might be implied with H2O). However, possible for B to be H3O+.

Wait the user instruction says "Select the suitable reagents..." which implies these are named reagents.

In a стандартном синтезе:

For the first reaction, combining a ketone with NaCN and an acid to form a cyanohydrin. That makes HCl the acid.

For the second reaction, hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid in acidic conditions. So, reagent B would be H2O in presence of H2SO4 or HCl. But since they mentioned the reagent is B (H2O), perhaps it's H2O with acid and heat. However, given in shorthand, the reagent is H3O+ (aq) maybe. Alternatively, the B is aqueous sulfuric acid. But perhaps in the context of a typical exam question:

Reagent A is HCl (since forming HCN from NaCN requires H+)

Reagent B is H2SO4, H2O, heat.

But again, since the original question writes B as (H2O), perhaps the B is simply H+ (aq), but common answers for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid are H3O+ or dilute H2SO4/HCl with heat. Alternatively, in some books, it's written as "H2O, H+".

So, the most precise answers based on typical reagent usage:

A: HCl

B: H2O/H2SO4, heat

But since the user presents reagents as A and B, maybe their exact answers are HCl for A and H2O with H2SO4 as B, but depending on formatting. Given that the user is prompting with "B (H2O)", I think they're expecting that B is aqueous acid. So, compiling everything, I think:

First reaction: HCl is reagent A.

Second reaction: H2O with an acid (like H2SO4) is reagent B.

But given that in the second reaction it's written as "+ B (H2O)", it's possible they are considering H2O as the reagent and that the nitrile hydrolysis is performed in water with some catalyst. However, in standard problems, such reagents are typically noted as aqueous acid. Therefore, the answer likely expects:

A: HCl or HCN. But using NaCN, so they want HCl.

B: H2O and H2SO4 (acidic hydrolysis)

But maybe symbolically, assuming standard,  2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acid is formed from nitrile via acidic hydrolysis.

So concluding, the answers would be:

A: HCl

B: H2SO4, H2O (heat)

But more precisely as per question formatting, reagent B is H2O (with implied acidic conditions), or reagent B is H3O+.

 Acknowledging possible variations, but given the problem statement, the answers should be:

A = HCl

B = H2SO4 (aqueous) and heat. But since written as B (H2O), maybe B is H3O+, but that's your choice. But HCl is for A. As per most textbooks 답변은.

So, the final answer is:

Reagent A is HCl for the first step.

Reagent B is H2SO4, H2O, and heat for the second step. But given the user requires the answer in the specified format with boxes, let me get that done.


**Final Answer**

For the first reaction, the suitable reagent A is \boxed{HCl}.  
For the second reaction, the suitable reagent B is \boxed{H_2SO_4} (with water and heat).

The product is a carboxylic acid with the same substituents. This looks like a hydrolysis reaction converting the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Typically, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, basic conditions might follow a two-step process: first hydrolyzing the nitrile to an amide and then to the acid under reflux. Alternatively, acidic conditions using an acid catalyst like H2SO4 and heat could also achieve this.\n\nHowever, since the reagent is given as B (H2O), perhaps H2O combined with a different acid or base. Let\'s recall the specific conditions for nitrile hydrolysis. In acidic conditions, H2O with H2SO4 (and heat) can hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

"Moving on to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon. The product is a carboxylic acid with the same substituents. This looks like a hydrolysis reaction converting the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Typically, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, basic conditions might follow a two-step process: first hydrolyzing the nitrile to an amide and then to the acid under reflux.

However, since the reagent is given as B (H2O), perhaps H2O combined with a different acid or base. Let's recall the specific conditions for nitrile hydrolysis. In acidic conditions, H2O with H2SO4 (and heat) can hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions (using NaOH or KOH), the nitrile would first form an amide and then further react to the carboxylate salt, which would require acid work-up to become the carboxylic acid. But the reagent given is B (H2O), so maybe the reaction uses acid.

Alternatively, the presence of the hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile could indicate some kind of neighboring group participation, but I don't think that applies here. The hydrolysis of a nitrile next to a hydroxyl group: perhaps such a structure might even hydrolyze under milder conditions.

However, the exact pathway might vary.

But since the desired product is the carboxylic acid, I think that the hydrolysis requires acidic conditions. Therefore, reagent B could be a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4 in aqueous conditions, possibly under heat. For example, heating with aqueous sulfuric acid would convert the nitrile to a carboxylic acid through an intermediate amide and/or via the imidic acid.

The question states "+ B (H2O)". So perhaps B is the other reagent (maybe catalyst, acid/base) with water as the solvent. If it's converting nitrile to carboxylic acid with water, needs either acidic or basic conditions. Maybe B is HCl, H2SO4 (for acid) or KOH, NaOH (for base) in water.

But for nitriles to become carboxylic acids under hydrolysis, generally either acidic (H+/H2O) or basic (HO-/H2O), but with different conditions and steps. For example, acidic hydrolysis (H2O, H2SO4, heat) converts nitriles directly to carboxylic acids, whereas basic may go through the amide, then acid (but needs acid to protonate).

In our case, the nitrile is on a carbon adjacent to a hydroxyl group, as in –C(OH)–CN. Such compounds (cyanohydrins) under acidic hydrolysis would generate alpha-hydroxy acids. The cyano group is converted to carboxylic acid with the hydroxyl remaining.

Thus, converting a cyanohydrin nitrile to an alpha-hydroxy acid, common conditions are using HCl (aq) and heating. For example, HCl in water under reflux would provide the acidic conditions needed for the nitrile to grow two hydroxyl groups (with the existing one) and form the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, using a strong mineral acid like concentrated HCl or H2SO4 in aqueous solution and heat would effect this conversion.

Thus, reagent B is likely aqueous HCl (hydrochloric acid) or H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) under heated conditions. Since H2O is already present, as in "B (H2O)", the reagent B might be a mineral acid (H+), like HCl or H2SO4.

Alternatively, if the nitrile is in a more activated position, like adjacent to a hydroxyl group, perhaps even milder conditions might work. But considering the typical reaction, I would think that strong acidic hydrolysis is needed here.

So for the second reaction, reagent B would be H2SO4 (dilute or conc.) or HCl (conc) in the presence of water and heat. Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, not an ester or anything else. Strong acid would suffice. Maybe they just need an acid, like H+ (HCl) and H2O.

Therefore, the first reaction's reagent A is H+ (acid like HCl or H2SO4) and the second reaction's reagent B is H2O with acid and heat. Alternatively, for B it's aqueous acid.

Based on that, the suitable reagents are:

For reaction 1: acid (HCl or H2SO4), so the answer would be HCl. Since, perhaps to produce HCN in situ. Also, sometimes these reactions are performed in aq. Solutions. For example, NaCN with HCl would form HCN. So combining NaCN and HCl (gas?) or aqueous HCl would make HCN. Therefore, reagent A would be HCl.

Another possibility is that reaction 2 uses HCN hydrolysis under basic conditions, but since product is a carboxylic acid I think acid is better.

Finally, to comply with common procedures:

Reaction 1: The formation of a cyanohydrin from a ketone commonly uses NaCN and a dilute acid (like HCl), which generates HCN in situ. Therefore, A is HCl.

Reaction 2: Hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid is typically done with strong aqueous acid (e.g., H2SO4, HCl) and heat. So B would be H2SO4 (or HCl). Since H2O is the solvent or part of the reagent, which would be provided. For the problem statement, as reagent B is explicitly mentioned along with H2O, I think reagent B is H2SO4 or HCl, possibly in aqueous conditions.

Therefore, wrapping up:

First reaction: A is HCl (aq) or H2SO4 (aq), since NaCN with H+ forms HCN necessary for cyanohydrin.

Second reaction: B is H2SO4 (aq) and heat, which hydrolyzes nitrile to carboxylic acid.

So the answers for reagents would be A: HCl (or H+) and B: H2SO4 (could also be HCl, H3O+ conditions). Given that standard conditions for these reactions would be:

For reaction 1: Dilute HCl added to NaCN and ketone to form the cyanohydrin. So reagent A is HCl.

For reaction 2: Concentrated HCl or H2SO4 with water and heat to hydrolyze the nitrile group. But possibly as it's given with H2O, perhaps B is H3O+ (H+ from an acid). So reagent B is HCl (aq) or H2SO4 (aq) under heat. Maybe the problem expects a more specific reagent. Considering that, reagent B is likely sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in water and heat.

Alternatively, both reactions could use HCl. But I'm leaning towards A as HCl and B as H2SO4 due to typical lab procedures.

Therefore, summarizing:

Reaction 1:

Butan-2-one + NaCN + HCl (aq) → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (cyanohydrin formation via HCN in situ)

Reaction 2:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + H2SO4 (aq), heat → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (acidic hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid)

Alternatively, generating HCN in situ via NaCN and HCl. Given reagents include NaCN and A, perhaps A is aqueous HCl. Also, correct stoichiometry would need H+ to protonate the alkoxide intermediate, ensuring the hydroxyl group formation. Wait, if we\'re using NaCN and adding acid, that would first generate HCN, but if the sodium cyanide is added in excess, perhaps the reaction can proceed stepwise. Alternatively, the acid might serve to catalyze the reaction. Alternatively, maybe H2O might be involved. But in this case, the presence of H2O would just provide a proton in the work-up. Alternatively, the scenario might be KCN in aqueous solution. However, HCN is a weaker conjugate acid. The pKa of HCN is about 9.2, so in aqueous solution, CN─ is predominant under basic conditions. In weakly acidic solutions (but not too acidic to protonate the carbonyl oxygen?), maybe. However, insufficient acid would limit HCN formation. Alternatively, perhaps due to activation by the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe with NH4Cl? Reacting NaCN and NH4Cl gives HCN and NaCl and NH3. Not sure. Alternatively, the aqueous medium from NaCN can supply some H+ required. But perhaps the reaction would need acid catalysis. Alternatively, if the reaction conditions are not severely acidic, maybe in a buffered solution. \n\nOptionally, perhaps NaCN in alcoholic solution. Alternatively, the nucleophilic addition requires mildly acidic conditions. Let me attempt to recall if sodium cyanide in HCl is a common method for in situ HCN generation. Yes, perhaps mixing NaCN with HCl produces HCN: NaCN + HCl → HCN + NaCl. HCN is dangerous but some processes use this method while handling properly.\n\nHence, in the first reaction, adding butan-2-one into a mixture of NaCN and HCl (with acid as reagent A) would generate HCN in situ, which then adds to the ketone to form the cyanohydrin, resulting in 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n\nMoving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with water and reagent B to yield 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The starting molecule is a cyanohydrin (has a hydroxyl and nitrile group adjacent). When converting nitriles to carboxylic acids, hydrolysis is necessary. Typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For example, in the presence of a strong acid (like H2SO4, H2O, heat), nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under basic conditions (like NaOH, H2O, heat), they first form an amide and then carboxylic acid. However, if the starting material already has an hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile, as in 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, perhaps acid hydrolysis would effect the transformation. In some cases, if it\'s a cyanohydrin (a β-hydroxy nitrile), such as the one in this case, the hydrolysis can directly give a β-hydroxy acid. The process typically uses a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4. Alternatively, depending on the protocol, sometimes H2O in the presence of a base. But I need to think precisely about the necessary conditions here.\n\nIn standard nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid: H+/H2O (acidic conditions, like concentrated HCl, H2O, heat) are required. Alternatively, using strong bases (like NaOH, then acidifying), which gives a carboxylate first. Since the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, under acidic conditions, the nitrile would protonate, making it more electrophilic, then undergo hydration steps. Then, successive protonations and water attacks would convert the nitrile into a carboxylic acid. Particularly, under hot acidic conditions, β-hydroxy nitriles hydrolyze to β-hydroxy carboxylic acids. So, nitrile to amide, then to acid. However, acidic conditions (like H2SO4, H2O, heat) are likely needed here. Since the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, and the reactant has the nitrile group in the same position. So, standard acid-catalyzed hydrolysis would be the way to go. Therefore, reagent B is likely H2SO4 (concentrated) and heating under reflux. Or perhaps HCl (aqueous HCl with heating). Considering that the nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions generally requires heating. The ion H3O+ acts as a catalyst. An example: RCN + H2O + H+ → RCOOH + NH4+ under heat. Therefore, the acid here can be sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, with water.\n\nAlternatively, if only H2O is indicated as part of reagent B, but probably it\'s B in H2O.

However, if reagent B is aqueous HCl (since the hydrolysis needs acid), then B would be HCl (aq). But in some cases, LiAlH4 reduces nitriles, but that leads to amines, which is not the case here. Alternatively, the difference between acidic and basic hydrolysis. Basic hydrolysis converts nitriles to carboxylic acids via intermediates—like NaOH, then work-up with acid. But in this case, the presence of a hydroxyl group might interact with base. The product is a hydroxy acid; perhaps use a strong acid to avoid any epoxide formations or intramolecular reactions. However, with the hydroxyl group present in the starting material, acidic conditions would protonate the hydroxyl, converting to water, and then hydrolysis proceeds.

 Since cyanide isn't a strong enough acid here, bringing in H+ via, say, HCl (aqueous conditions) would be necessary. 

Hence, the standard experiment is using HCN and ketone under acidic conditions. Alternatively, generating HCN in situ via NaCN and HCl. Given reagents include NaCN and A, perhaps A is aqueous HCl. Also, correct stoichiometry would need H+ to protonate the alkoxide intermediate, ensuring the hydroxyl group formation. Wait, if we're using NaCN and adding acid, that would first generate HCN, but if the sodium cyanide is added in excess, perhaps the reaction can proceed stepwise. Alternatively, the acid might serve to catalyze the reaction. Alternatively, maybe H2O might be involved. But in this case, the presence of H2O would just provide a proton in the work-up. Alternatively, the scenario might be KCN in aqueous solution. However, HCN is a weaker conjugate acid. The pKa of HCN is about 9.2, so in aqueous solution, CN─ is predominant under basic conditions. In weakly acidic solutions (but not too acidic to protonate the carbonyl oxygen?), maybe. However, insufficient acid would limit HCN formation. Alternatively, perhaps due to activation by the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe with NH4Cl? Reacting NaCN and NH4Cl gives HCN and NaCl and NH3. Not sure. Alternatively, the aqueous medium from NaCN can supply some H+ required. But perhaps the reaction would need acid catalysis. Alternatively, if the reaction conditions are not severely acidic, maybe in a buffered solution. 

Optionally, perhaps NaCN in alcoholic solution. Alternatively, the nucleophilic addition requires mildly acidic conditions. Let me attempt to recall if sodium cyanide in HCl is a common method for in situ HCN generation. Yes, perhaps mixing NaCN with HCl produces HCN: NaCN + HCl → HCN + NaCl. HCN is dangerous but some processes use this method while handling properly.

Hence, in the first reaction, adding butan-2-one into a mixture of NaCN and HCl (with acid as reagent A) would generate HCN in situ, which then adds to the ketone to form the cyanohydrin, resulting in 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Moving to the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile is treated with water and reagent B to yield 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The starting molecule is a cyanohydrin (has a hydroxyl and nitrile group adjacent). When converting nitriles to carboxylic acids, hydrolysis is necessary. Typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For example, in the presence of a strong acid (like H2SO4, H2O, heat), nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, under basic conditions (like NaOH, H2O, heat), they first form an amide and then carboxylic acid. However, if the starting material already has an hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile, as in 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, perhaps acid hydrolysis would effect the transformation. In some cases, if it's a cyanohydrin (a β-hydroxy nitrile), such as the one in this case, the hydrolysis can directly give a β-hydroxy acid. The process typically uses a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4. Alternatively, depending on the protocol, sometimes H2O in the presence of a base. But I need to think precisely about the necessary conditions here.

In standard nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid: H+/H2O (acidic conditions, like concentrated HCl, H2O, heat) are required.

But in the context of an exam question, often either H+ (aq, with heat) or H2SO4 (liquid), but since H2O is already indicated, perhaps trigged by H+ as acid. So B is H2SO4.
