# Original Question

We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution?

Okay, so I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)₂²⁻ complex, out of all the cobalt-containing species in the solution. Let me break this down.

The problem gives the total cobalt concentration as 10⁻² M and the thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Hmm, stability constants usually represent the formation of complexes, right? So βₙ is the equilibrium constant for the reaction Co²⁺ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)ₙ²⁻⁽ⁿ⁻²⁾? Wait, actually, for Co²⁺, each complex would have a charge of 2+ minus the thiocyanate ions, which are each -1. So Co²⁺ with 1 SCN⁻ would be [Co(SCN)]⁺, β1; with 2 SCN⁻, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, β2; with 3 SCN⁻, [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, β3; and with 4 SCN⁻, [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, β4. Wait, but the problem mentions β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. But sometimes, β values can be cumulative, meaning β2 is the product of the stepwise constants K1 and K2. But here, the problem states "stability constants," so each βn is for the overall formation from Co²⁺ and n SCN⁻. So, for each n, βn = [Co(SCN)ₙ²⁻ⁿ⁾] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]ⁿ).

So our cobalt species are Co²⁺, Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, Co(SCN)₄²⁻. Wait, but each complex has a charge of Co²⁺ minus the SCN⁻ ligands. So if SCN⁻ is a ligand, each adds -1. So:

- Co²⁺ (n=0)

- [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1)

- [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ (n=2)

- [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3)

- [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4)

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species:

c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 10⁻² M.

The [SCN⁻] is given as 0.1 M. Wait, but when SCN⁻ is a ligand, some of it is consumed in forming the complexes. However, the problem says that the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M. Maybe that's the free SCN⁻ concentration? Or is it the total concentration? That's a bit unclear. Let me read the problem again.

"The [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M." That probably refers to the analytical concentration, total SCN⁻, which includes both free and bound SCN⁻. But in complexation equilibria, the free ligand concentration is needed for calculations. If the given [SCN⁻] is the free concentration, then that simplifies things. Wait, maybe the problem states that the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, but since SCN⁻ is in excess, the free concentration can be approximated as 0.1 M. Because if the total Co is 10⁻² M, and the SCN− is 0.1 M, which is higher, the amount bound to Co²⁺ is minimal, so [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M. Therefore, the approximation might hold. Let me check. The maximum possible SCN⁻ used in complexes would be 4 × 10⁻² M (if all Co forms Co(SCN)₄²⁻). But since [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (0.1 = 10⁻¹, while 4e-2 is 0.04), so 0.1 - 0.04 = 0.06 M left. But since other complexes will use less SCN, perhaps the free SCN⁻ is approximately 0.1 M. The problem might be assuming that the free SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, maybe because it's in excess, and complexes are negligible in affecting [SCN⁻]. That seems plausible. So for the purpose of calculation, we can take [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

So, given that, then the fraction of each cobalt species can be calculated using the stability constants. The general formula is that each complex concentration is βn × [Co²⁺] × [SCN⁻]^n.

So, let alpha_0 = [Co²⁺]/c(Co)

alpha_1 = [Co(SCN)⁺]/c(Co) = β1 [SCN⁻] × alpha_0

alpha_2 = [Co(SCN)₂]/c(Co) = β2 [SCN⁻]^2 × alpha_0

Similarly:

alpha_3 = β3 [SCN⁻]^3 × alpha_0

alpha_4 = beta4 [SCN⁻]^4 × alpha_0

Since the total concentration is the sum of all species:

alpha_0 + alpha_1 + alpha_2 + alpha_3 + alpha_4 = 1

So substituting:

alpha_0 + beta1 [SCN] alpha_0 + beta2 [SCN]^2 alpha_0 + beta3 [SCN]^3 alpha_0 + beta4 [SCN]^4 alpha_0 = 1

Thus, alpha_0 (1 + beta1 [SCN] + beta2 [SCN]^2 + beta3 [SCN]^3 + beta4 [SCN]^4) = 1

Therefore:

alpha_0 = 1 / (1 + beta1 [SCN] + beta2 [SCN]^2 + beta3 [SCN]^3 + beta4 [SCN]^4)

Given [SCN⁻] as 0.1 M, let's compute this denominator:

First, plug in the numbers.

Given:

beta1 = 9

beta2 = 40

beta3 = 63

beta4 = 16

[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: beta1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term 2: beta2 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

Term 3: beta3 * [SCN]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

Term 4: beta4 * [SCN]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 ≈ 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3; 2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363; 2.363 + 0.0016 ≈ 2.3646

Therefore, alpha_0 ≈ 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423

Therefore, the fraction of Co²⁺ is alpha_0 ≈ 0.423. But we need the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰. Its fraction is alpha_2 = beta2 [SCN]^2 * alpha_0 = 40 * (0.1)^2 * 0.423 ≈ 40 * 0.01 * 0.423 ≈ 0.4 * 0.423 ≈ 0.1692. So approximately 16.92%.

But let's check the calculation again to be precise.

Wait, since:

Denominator sum: 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001

Which is:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016

Which adds up to:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = approximately 2.3646

Thus, alpha_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423.

Then alpha_2 = beta2 * (0.1)^2 * alpha_0 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.423 ≈ 0.4 * 0.423 = 0.1692. So about 16.92%.

So converting to percentage, that is 16.92%, so approximately 17%.

But it's better to compute more accurately.

First, 2.3646 as the denominator.

1 / 2.3646 = approx. 0.423.

So alpha_2 is beta2 [SCN]^2 * alpha_0. So beta2 is 40, [SCN]^2 is 0.01, 40*0.01 = 0.4. Then 0.4 * alpha_0 (≈0.423) = 0.4 * 0.423 = 0.1692, so 16.92%. Round to two decimal places, 16.92%, so maybe 16.9%? But check the exact calculation.

Wait, actually, perhaps more precise computation of alpha_0:

2.3646 is the denominator. So:

1 ÷ 2.3646:

2.3646 ) 1.0000

2.3646 goes into 10 → 0.423, but let's compute:

Since 2.3646 ≈ 2 + 0.3646

Compute reciprocal:

1 / (2 + 0.3646) = (1/2) / (1 + 0.3646 / 2) ≈ 0.5 / (1 + 0.1823) = 0.5 / 1.1823 ≈ 0.423.

But actually, 1.1823 * 0.423 ≈ 0.423 + 0.423*0.1823 ≈ 0.423 + 0.077 = 0.5, so accurate.

Thus, alpha_0 ≈ 0.423.

Therefore, alpha_2 = 0.4 * 0.423 = 0.1692.

So, the percentage is approximately 16.92%.

The problem might need the answer to two significant figures. The beta constants are given as whole numbers, so possibly two or three significant figures.

Based on the stability constants given (β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16) which have two sig figs (except maybe β3 is 63, which is two sig figs). The concentrations have c(Co) = 10^-2 M (1 sig fig) and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (1 sig fig). However, in the calculation, the sum is 2.3646 which uses [SCN] as 0.1 M. Since [SCN] is given as 0.1 M, which is one significant figure, but the problem might consider all the Beta values as exact (maybe in a problem setup where they are given as precise constants). So if Beta values are considered exact, and the concentrations are given with two decimal places (c(Co)=0.01 M could be 1.0 ×10⁻², two sig figs; [SCN⁻]=0.1 M is 1 sig fig). But 0.1 M is one sig fig. That complicates things. However, perhaps when the problem states c(Co) = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, it's expected to treat the concentrations as exact for the purpose of calculation, or to present it to, say, two decimal places. Otherwise, significant figures would limit the answer to one significant figure (since [SCN⁻] is 0.1, one sig fig). But given that in chemistry problems like this, sometimes they expect the answer to two decimal places. Let me check: The computed value is approx.16.92%, so maybe 17% if rounding to two significant figures. But perhaps in the problem context, it's better to calculate with all the given decimals and then round appropriately. But as per the given data, perhaps 17%.

Alternatively, if all constants are considered exact and the concentrations are exact (since they are given as c(Co) = 10⁻² M and [SCN] = 0.1 M), the precise calculation gives alpha_0 = 1 / (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 1 / 2.3646. Let's compute 1/2.3646:

First, 2.3646 × 0.4 = 0.94584

0.94584 + 2.3646 × 0.02 ≈ 0.94584 + 0.04729 ≈ 0.99313

Continue:

2.3646 × 0.423 = 0.4*2.3646=0.9458; 0.02*2.3646=0.04729; 0.003*2.3646=0.00709. Total: ≈0.9458 + 0.04729=0.9931 + 0.00709≈1.0002. So 0.423*2.3646≈1.0002. Thus, 1/2.3646≈0.423.

Therefore, alpha_0≈0.423. Then alpha_2= 40*(0.1)^2*0.423= 40*0.01*0.423 = 0.4*0.423=0.1692. So 0.1692 as the fraction. So 16.92%, which is approximately 16.9%. Therefore, depending on the required precision, but the options may require two decimal places or one.

But perhaps the problem expects to compute it without approximations. Wait, did we assume [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, but if the actual [SCN⁻] is less because some is used in complexes, should we take that into account?

Wait, in my initial calculation, I assumed that the free [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. But actually, the given [SCN⁻] might be the total concentration, considering all the thiocyanate that's free and bound. That complicates things because we have to calculate the free [SCN⁻], considering the equilibrium.

But the problem states "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". Which usually implies the analytical concentration, but complexes are present, so it's ambiguous.

But the wording says "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". Since SCN⁻ can form complexes, the "concentration" could be misinterpreted. In chemical terms, when total concentration is given, it's called the analytical concentration. But in the context of equilibrium, writing [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M is the equilibrium concentration of free SCN⁻. If the problem intended the total SCN⁻ (free + bound), then we can't assume free [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. That would complicate the problem a lot. So I need to figure out whether [SCN⁻] given is the free or the total.

Looking back at the problem statement: "...the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M." In chemical notation, [SCN⁻] usually refers to the equilibrium concentration (free), unless stated otherwise. However, if it was the analytical concentration, they might specify "total SCN⁻ concentration". But given that it's written in the same way as the cobalt concentration ("total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M"), which is an analytical concentration. However, for SCN⁻, if listed as "[SCN-] concentration", that's the free concentration. But maybe in this problem, they simplified and considered that since SCN⁻ is in excess (0.1 M vs. 0.01 M Co), the free [SCN-] is ~0.1 M. So sometimes, in such problems, if the ligand is in large excess, you approximate the free ligand concentration as equal to the total concentration.

Let me check the assumption's validity. The maximum possible SCN⁻ bound by Co²⁺ is if all Co²⁺ is in the complex with the highest ligand number, here, 4. So 0.01 M Co ×4=0.04 M SCN⁻ consumed. Adding that to the equation:

Total SCN⁻ = [SCN⁻]_free + 0.04 M ≈ 0.1 M. Therefore, if total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, [SCN⁻]_free ≈0.06, but if in the problem, [SCN⁻] is given as 0.1 M as the free concentration, then the amount bound is 0.04 M, and the total SCN⁻ would be 0.14 M. But the problem says "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". Thus, unless it's stated as total, we can suppose it's the free concentration. Otherwise, without this assumption, the problem becomes more complicated, which we need to set up equations with both Co and SCN⁻ total concentrations.

But given the problem didn't specify, and given typical problem structures, I think we are supposed to take [SCN⁻] as 0.1 M, the free concentration, perhaps as an approximation because it's in excess.

But to be thorough, maybe I should consider both possibilities. Let me test both scenarios.

First case: [SCN⁻]_free =0.1 M. Then compute as before. Get 16.9%.

Second case: total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M. Then we need to calculate [SCN⁻]_free. Let's see how complex it is.

If total Co is c(Co)=10⁻² M, and total SCN is 0.1 M, then we can set up the equations.

The total SCN⁻ is given by [SCN⁻]_total = [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]

Similarly for Co:

[Co_total] = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.01 M

Given that, we can express each complex in terms of [Co²⁺] and [SCN⁻].

For complexes:

[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^2

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^3

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^4

Total Co:

[Co_total] = [Co²⁺] (1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]^2 + β3[SCN⁻]^3 + β4[SCN⁻]^4 ) = 0.01 M

Total SCN⁻:

[SCN⁻]_total = [SCN⁻] + β1 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + 2 β2 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^2 + 3 β3 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^3 + 4 β4 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^4 ) = 0.1 M

Thus, let’s denote F =1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]^2 + β3[SCN⁻]^3 + β4[SCN⁻]^4

So,

[Co²⁺] = 0.01 / F

Now, total SCN⁻:

[SCN⁻] + [Co²⁺] ( β1[SCN⁻] + 2 β2[SCN⁻]^2 +3 β3[SCN⁻]^3 +4 β4[SCN⁻]^4 ) =0.1

Substitute [Co²⁺] = 0.01 / F into this:

[SCN⁻] + (0.01 / F) * ( β1[SCN⁻] + 2 β2[SCN⁻]^2 +3 β3[SCN⁻]^3 +4 β4[SCN⁻]^4 ) =0.1

But F =1 + β1[SCN⁻] + β2[SCN⁻]^2 + β3[SCN⁻]^3 + β4[SCN⁻]^4

Thus, let’s substitute F into the equation.

But solving this equation requires knowing [SCN⁻], which is part of F. This is a nonlinear equation, and solving it would need iteration.

Alternatively, since [SCN⁻] is small compared to the bound ligand?

Wait, but [SCN⁻]_total is 0.1 M, and [SCN⁻] is now going to be less due to binding, whereas bound SCN⁻ is sum_of (n * [Co(SCN)_n^{(2−n)+} }

First, let’s make an initial guess [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 – this is the free SCN in the case we assumed before. Then compute F, and the bound SCN.

Compute F with [SCN⁻]=0.1:

F = 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4=2.3646 as before.

Thus, [Co²⁺]=0.01 / 2.3646≈0.00423 M

Compute bound SCN⁻ from complexes:

= [Co(SCN)^+] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] +3 [Co(SCN)3⁻] +4[Co(SCN)4²⁻]

= β1 [Co²⁺][SCN⁻] + 2 β2 [Co²][SCN]^2 +3 β3 [コバルト][S]^3+4 β4[..]

= 9 * 0.00423 *0.1 + 2*40*0.00423*(0.1)^2 + 3*63*0.00423*(0.1)^3 + 4*16*0.00423*(0.1)^4

Compute each term:

First term: 9 *0.00423*0.1 =9*0.000423=0.003807

Second term: 2*40*0.00423*0.01=80*0.00423*0.01=0.03384

Third term:3*63*0.00423*0.001 =189*0.00423*0.001=0.189*0.00423=0.000796

Fourth term:4*16*0.00423*0.0001 =64*0.00423*0.0001=0.000027

Sum all bound SCN⁻:

0.003807 +0.03384=0.037647

+0.000796=0.038443

+0.000027≈0.03847 M

Therefore, total SCN⁻ is [SCN⁻] + bound SCN⁻=0.1 +0.03847≈0.13847≈0.1385 M

But the problem stated that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (total or free). Wait, in the problem statement, if the total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, we have a conflict here. Because when we assumed free [SCN⁻]=0.1, the total SCN⁻ would be approximately 0.1385 M. But the problem says 0.1 M. So obviously, in order for total SCN⁻ to be 0.1 M, free [SCN⁻] must be less than that, so my first approach assuming [SCN⁻]=0.1 is invalid in this case.

Thus, the correct approach is to set up the equations considering the total SCN⁻ and Co. So given that both total concentrations of Co and SCN⁻ are given, we have to solve for free [SCN⁻].

Therefore, let's formalize it.

Total Co, TCo = 0.01 M

Total SCN, TSCN =0.1 M

Each complex [Co(SCN)_n^(2−n)] = βn [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^n

Σ[Co(SCN)_n] = TCo ⇒ [Co²⁺] * F = TCo ⇒ [Co²⁺]= TCo / F

Σn [Co(SCN)_n] = TSCN - [SCN⁻]

But wait, total SCN⁻ is:

TSCN = [SCN⁻] + Σn [Co(SCN)_n^(2−n)}] n

Which is:

[SCN⁻] + Σ (n * βn [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^n) = TSCN

So substituting [Co²⁺] = TCo / F,

we get:

[SCN⁻] + Σ (n * βn (TCo / F) [SCN⁻]^n ) = TSCN

But F = Σ (βn [SCN⁻]^n} from n=0 to 4 (since it's 1 + β1[SCN] +...+β4[SCN]^4)

The equation is complicated. But maybe using iteration is possible. Let’s attempt.

First, make an initial guess for [SCN⁻].

Let me start with [SCN⁻] =0.06 M (arbitrary mid-value between 0 and 0.1)

Compute F:

F =1 + 9*0.06 + 40*(0.06)^2 +63*(0.06)^3 +16*(0.06)^4

Compute step by step:

Term 1:1

Term 2:9*0.06=0.54

Term3:40*0.0036=0.144

Term4:63*0.000216=0.013608

Term5:16*0.00001296≈0.00020736

Sum:

1 +0.54=1.54

1.54+0.144=1.684

1.684+0.013608≈1.6976

1.6976 +0.00020736 ≈1.6978

Thus, F≈1.6978

Therefore, [Co²⁺] = 0.01 /1.6978 ≈0.00589

Compute bound SCN:

Σ(n * βn [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^n )

=1*9*0.00589*0.06 +2*40*0.00589*(0.06)^2 +3*63*0.00589*(0.06)^3 +4*16*0.00589*(0.06)^4

Compute each term:

First term:

1*9*0.00589*0.06 ≈9*0.000353≈0.00318

Second term:

2*40*0.00589*0.0036=80*0.00589*0.0036=0.01700

Third term:

3*63*0.00589*0.000216≈189*0.00589*0.000216≈189*0.001270≈0.240

But wait, 0.00589*0.000216≈0.000001271. Then 189*0.000001271≈0.000240

Fourth term:

4*16*0.00589*(0.06)^4 =64*0.00589*0.00001296≈64*0.000076. 0.000076≈4.864e-6

Sum bound SCN:

0.00318 +0.01700=0.02018

+0.000240≈0.02042

+0.000004864≈0.020425 M

Thus, total SCN would be [SCN⁻] + bound =0.06+0.020425≈0.080425 M, which is less than 0.1 M. So we need a lower [SCN⁻]...? Wait, no:[SCN⁻]_bound added to free is supposed to equal TSCN=0.1. Thus, our current estimate for total bound is 0.020425 M. So free + bound=0.06 +0.020425=0.080425 < 0.1; thus, we need to have more bound. That would happen if [SCN⁻] is higher, bound with SCN decreases but if [SCN⁻] is lower, weitehr.

Wait, no, hold on: increasing [SCN⁻] leads to more complexation, which binds more SCN, thus total bound would increase.

Wait, if [SCN⁻] increases, then more ligands are available, so more complexes form, and more SCN⁻ is bound. So since the current total at [SCN⁻]=0.06 is 0.08, we need to incrementence. Therefore, we need a higher [SCN⁻], because:

TSCN = (free [SCN⁻]) + bound SCN.

At [SCN⁻] =0.06, total=0.08<0.1, so need to raise free [SCN-]?

No, that seems contradictory. If free [SCN⁻]=0.06 gives total SCN=0.08, which is less than the desired 0.1. To reach 0.1, we need to get more total. But if you raise free [SCN⁻], bound SCN will increase, thus adding to it. Alternatively, perhaps I made thinking mistake.

Wait, suppose free [SCN⁻] increases: then, the amount of bound SCN depends on the complexes.

But the idea is:

If you have more free SCN⁻, according to the complexes' formation, possibly the bound SCN may either increase or decrease depending...Wait for higher [SCN⁻], the stabilization effect may shift more cobalt into higher complexes, binding more SCN per cobalt.

Therefore, it's possible that increasing [SCN⁻] would lead to more bound SCN, making TSCN = free [SCN] + bound Scn increase, which would match our desired 0.1. Since our first guess gives TSCN=0.0804.

But we need to adjust.

Let me check TSCN when [SCN⁻] is 0.08.

F =1 +9*0.08 +40*(0.08)^2 +63*(0.08)^3 +16*(0.08)^4

Compute:

Sum F=1 +0.72=1.72+0.256=1.976+0.032256≈2.008+0.000655≈2.008655

Thus, total SCN=0.08 +0.006625≈0.086625 M <0.1

Hmm, still too low.

Next guess, increase [SCN] to 0.09 M:

TSCN=0.09 +0.014853=0.104853 M ≅0.105 M which is higher than 0.1. Need a [SCN⁻] lower than 0.09 M to reach TSCN=0.1.

Need to interpolate between [SCN⁻]=0.08 (T=0.086625), [SCN⁻]=0.09 (T=0.10485). Want [SCN⁻] such that T=0.1.

Define delta =0.1 -0.086625 =0.013375 when [SCN⁻}=0.08

Similarly, at [SCN⁻}=0.09, T=0.10485 -0.1= -0.00485 over.

Wait, need to use linear interpolation perhaps. Though non-linear, but as approximation.

Between [SCN⁻]=0.08, T=0.086625; [SCN⁻]=0.09, T=0.10485. We want T=0.1. Which is a T of an increase of 0.1 -0.086625 =0.013375

From 0.08 to0.09, delta_T=0.10485 -0.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)₂²⁻ complex, out of all the cobalt-containing species in the solution. Let me break this down.

The problem gives the total cobalt concentration as 10⁻² M and the thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Hmm, stability constants usually represent the formation of complexes, right? So βₙ is the equilibrium constant for the reaction Co²⁺ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)ₙ²⁻⁽ⁿ⁻²⁾? Wait, actually, for Co²⁺, each complex would have a charge of 2+ minus the thiocyanate ions, which are each -1. So Co²⁺ with 1 SCN⁻ would be [Co(SCN)]⁺, β1; with 2 SCN⁻, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, β2; with 3 SCN⁻, [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, β3; and with 4 SCN⁻, [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, β4. Wait, but the problem mentions β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. But sometimes, β values can be cumulative, meaning β2 is the product of the stepwise constants K1 and K2. But here, the problem states "stability constants," so each βn is for the overall formation from Co²⁺ and n SCN⁻. So, for each n, βn = [Co(SCN)ₙ²⁻ⁿ⁾] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]ⁿ).

So our cobalt species are Co²⁺, Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, Co(SCN)₄²⁻. Wait, but each complex has a charge of Co²⁺ minus the SCN⁻ ligands. So if SCN⁻ is a ligand, each adds -1. So:

- Co²⁺ (n=0)

- [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1)

- [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ (n=2)

- [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3)

- [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4)

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species:

c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 10⁻² M.

The [SCN⁻] is given as 0.1 M. Wait, but when SCN⁻ is a ligand, some of it is consumed in forming the complexes. However, the problem says that the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M. Maybe that's the free SCN⁻ concentration? Or is it the total concentration? That's a bit unclear. Let me read the problem again.

"The [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M." That probably refers to the analytical concentration, total SCN⁻, which includes both free and bound SCN⁻. But in complexation equilibria, the free ligand concentration is needed for calculations. If the given [SCN⁻] is the free concentration, then that simplifies things. Wait, maybe the problem states that the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, but since SCN⁻ is in excess, the free concentration can be approximated as 0.1 M. Because if the total Co is 10⁻² M, and the SCN− is 0.1 M, which is higher, the amount bound to Co²⁺ is minimal, so [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M. Therefore, the approximation might hold. Let me check. The maximum possible SCN⁻ used in complexes would be 4 × 10⁻² M (if all Co forms Co(SCN)₄²⁻). But since [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (0.1 = 10⁻¹, while 4e-2 is 0.04), so 0.1 - 0.04 = 0.06 M left. But since other complexes will use less SCN, perhaps the free SCN⁻ is approximately 0.1 M. The problem might be assuming that the free SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, maybe because it's in excess, and complexes are negligible in affecting [SCN⁻]. That seems plausible. So for the purpose of calculation, we can take [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

So, given that, then the fraction of each cobalt species can be calculated using the stability constants. The general formula is that each complex concentration is βn × [Co²⁺] × [SCN⁻]^n.

So, let alpha_0 = [Co²⁺]/c(Co)

alpha_1 = [Co(SCN)⁺]/c(Co) = β1 [SCN⁻] × alpha_0

alpha_2 = [Co(SCN)₂]/c(Co) = β2 [SCN⁻]^2 × alpha_0

Similarly:

alpha_3 = β3 [SCN⁻]^3 × alpha_0

alpha_4 = beta4 [SCN⁻]^4 × alpha_0

Since the total concentration is the sum of all species:

alpha_0 + alpha_1 + alpha_2 + alpha_3 + alpha_4 = 1

So substituting:

alpha_0 + beta1 [SCN] alpha_0 + beta2 [SCN]^2 alpha_0 + beta3 [SCN]^3 alpha_0 + beta4 [SCN]^4 alpha_0 = 1

Thus, alpha_0 (1 + beta1 [SCN] + beta2 [SCN]^2 + beta3 [SCN]^3 + beta4 [SCN]^4) = 1

Therefore:

alpha_0 = 1 / (1 + beta1 [SCN] + beta2 [SCN]^2 + beta3 [SCN]^3 + beta4 [SCN]^4)

Given [SCN⁻] as 0.1 M, let's compute this denominator:

First, plug in the numbers.

Given:

beta1 = 9

beta2 = 40

beta3 = 63

beta4 = 16

[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: beta1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term 2: beta2 * [SCN]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

Term 3: beta3 * [SCN]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

Term 4: beta4 * [SCN]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 ≈ 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3; 2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363; 2.363 + 0.0016 ≈ 2.3646

Therefore, alpha_0 ≈ 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423

Therefore, the fraction of Co²⁺ is alpha_0 ≈ 0.423. But we need the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰. Its fraction is alpha_2 = beta2 [SCN]^2 * alpha_0 = 40 * (0.1)^2 * 0.423 ≈ 40 * 0.01 * 0.423 ≈ 0.4 * 0.423 ≈ 0.1692. So approximately 16.92%.

But let's check the calculation again to be precise.

Wait, since:

Denominator sum: 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001

Which is:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016

Which adds up to:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = approximately 2.3646

Thus, alpha_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423.

Then alpha_2 = beta2 * (0.1)^2 * alpha_0 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.423 ≈ 0.4 * 0.423 = 0.1692. So abou

In order to determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, represented by the formula Co(SCN)₂, out of all the cobalt-containing species present in the solution, let's approach the problem step by step.

The problem provides us with the total cobalt concentration of 10⁻² M and the thiocyanate concentration of 0.1 M. Additionally, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. These stability constants correspond to the formation of complexes, where βₙ represents the equilibrium constant for the reaction Co²⁺ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)ₙ²⁻⁽ⁿ⁻²⁾. Each complex would have a charge of 2+ minus the number of thiocyanate ions, which are each -1. Therefore, the complexes formed are: [Co(SCN)]⁺ (β1), [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ (β2), [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (β3), and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (β4).

The cobalt species present in the solution are Co²⁺, Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, and Co(SCN)₄²⁻. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species, which is given as 10⁻² M.

The problem states that the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which likely refers to the total concentration, including both free and bound thiocyanate ions. Since the total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is significantly higher, the amount of thiocyanate bound to cobalt is relatively small. Therefore, we can approximate the free thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M for the purpose of our calculations.

Using the stability constants and the free thiocyanate concentration, we can calculate the fraction of each cobalt species. Let alpha_n represent the fraction of the cobalt species with n thiocyanate ligands. The general formula for each complex concentration is βn × [Co²⁺] × [SCN⁻]^n.

Since the sum of all fractions must equal 1, we can set up an equation:

alpha_0 + beta1 [SCN] alpha_0 + beta2 [SCN]^2 alpha_0 + beta3 [SCN]^3 alpha_0 + beta4 [SCN]^4 alpha_0 = 1

Solving for alpha_0:

alpha_0 = 1 / (1 + beta1 [SCN] + beta2 [SCN]^2 + beta3 [SCN]^3 + beta4 [SCN]^4)

Plugging in the given values and calculating the denominator:

1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001 ≈ 2.3646

Therefore, alpha_0 ≈ 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423.

To find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, we use:

alpha_2 = beta2 [SCN]^2 * alpha_0 = 40 * (0.1)^2 * 0.423 ≈ 0.1692

Converting the fraction to a percentage, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, Co(SCN)₂, out of all the cobalt-containing species in the solution is approximately 16.92%.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I believe is the Co(SCN)₂²⁻ complex, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. Let's break this down.

The total cobalt concentration is given as 10⁻² M and the thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Stability constants refer to the formation of complexes, so βₙ represents the equilibrium constant for the reaction Co²⁺ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)ₙ²⁻⁽ⁿ⁻²⁾. Considering each SCN⁻ is -1 and Co²⁺ is 2+, the charges for different complexes would be [Co(SCN)]⁺, β1; [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, β2; [Co(SCN)₃]⁻, β3; and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, β4. The β values are for the overall formation from Co²⁺ and n SCN⁻, so for each n, βn = [Co(SCN)ₙ²⁻ⁿ⁾] / ([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]ⁿ).

Thus, cobalt species include Co²⁺, Co(SCN)⁺, Co(SCN)₂, Co(SCN)₃⁻, Co(SCN)₄²⁻. Each complex’s charge is based on Co²⁺ minus SCN⁻ ligands: 

- Co²⁺ (n=0)

- [Co(SCN)]⁺ (n=1)

- [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ (n=2)

- [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3)

- [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4)

The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 10⁻² M. The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The problem likely implies this is the total SCN⁻ concentration, including free and bound SCN⁻. Because SCN⁻ is in excess, the free concentration can be approximated as 0.1 M. Since the total Co is 10⁻² M and SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, with the maximum possible SCN⁻ used being 4 × 10⁻² M, this leaves 0.06 M free SCN⁻. The free SCN⁻ concentration likely approximates 0.1 M for calculations.

Given this, the fraction of each cobalt species can be calculated with the stability constants. The general formula is that each complex concentration is βn × [Co²⁺] × [SCN⁻]ⁿ.

Define:

alpha_0 = [Co²⁺]/c(Co)

alpha_1 = [Co(SCN)⁺]/c(Co) = β1 [SCN⁻] × alpha_0

alpha_2 = [Co(SCN)₂]/c(Co) = β2 [SCN⁻]² × alpha_0

Continuing similarly:

alpha_3 = β3 [SCN⁻]³ × alpha_0

alpha_4 = β4 [SCN⁻]⁴ × alpha_0

Since the total concentration equals the sum of all species:

alpha_0 + alpha_1 + alpha_2 + alpha_3 + alpha_4 = 1

Then substitute:

alpha_0 + beta1 [SCN] alpha_0 + beta2 [SCN]² alpha_0 + beta3 [SCN]³ alpha_0 + beta4 [SCN]⁴ alpha_0 = 1

Thus, alpha_0 (1 + beta1 [SCN] + beta2 [SCN]² + beta3 [SCN]³ + beta4 [SCN]⁴) = 1

Thus:

alpha_0 = 1 / (1 + beta1 [SCN] + beta2 [SCN]² + beta3 [SCN]³ + beta4 [SCN]⁴)

With [SCN⁻] at 0.1 M, let's solve the denominator:

Plug in the constants:

beta1 = 9

beta2 = 40

beta3 = 63

beta4 = 16

[SCN⁻] = 0.1 M

Calculate each term:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: beta1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term 2: beta2 * [SCN]² = 40 * (0.1)² = 0.4

Term 3: beta3 * [SCN]³ = 63 * (0.1)³ = 0.063

Term 4: beta4 * [SCN]⁴ = 16 * (0.1)⁴ = 0.0016

Sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

Therefore, alpha_0 ≈ 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423

Thus, the fraction of Co²⁺ is alpha_0 ≈ 0.423. But we seek the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, which is alpha_2:

alpha_2 = beta2 [SCN]² * alpha_0 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.423 ≈ 0.4 * 0.423 ≈ 0.1692, or approximately 16.92%.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we start by using the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \(10^{-2}\) M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are \(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), and \(\beta_4 = 16\).

1. **Assumption of Free SCN⁻ Concentration**:
   The problem states the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M, which is assumed to be the free concentration due to the excess of SCN⁻ compared to Co²⁺.

2. **Calculation of \(\alpha_0\)**:
   \(\alpha_0\) is the fraction of free Co²⁺ ions. It is calculated using the stability constants and the free SCN⁻ concentration:
   \[
   \alpha_0 = \frac{1}{1 + \beta_1 [SCN^-] + \beta_2 [SCN^-]^2 + \beta_3 [SCN^-]^3 + \beta_4 [SCN^-]^4}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \alpha_0 = \frac{1}{1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4}
   \]
   \[
   \alpha_0 = \frac{1}{1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016} = \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.423
   \]

3. **Calculation of \(\alpha_2\)**:
   \(\alpha_2\) is the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)₂):
   \[
   \alpha_2 = \beta_2 [SCN^-]^2 \alpha_0
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \alpha_2 = 40 (0.1)^2 (0.423) = 40 \times 0.01 \times 0.423 = 0.1692
   \]

4. **Percentage Calculation**:
   Converting \(\alpha_2\) to a percentage:
   \[
   0.1692 \times 100 \approx 16.92\%
   \]

Considering significant figures and rounding, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is approximately 17%.

\[
\boxed{17\%}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

16.92%.

But let me check if beta2 is the cumulative stability constant. Wait, sometimes stability constants are defined stepwise. Wait, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So, βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands. So, for example, β2 corresponds to the reaction:

Co²⁺ + 2 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₂, with β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]/([Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^2) = 40.

Therefore, the calculation is correct as done above.

Therefore, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is approximately 16.92%, so about 17%.

But let me check if the beta values are correct. Wait, the given beta values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, usually, stability constants for each successive complex might increase or decrease. Here, β1=9, β2=40 (which is higher), β3=63 (even higher), β4=16 (lower). That seems a bit odd. Normally, the stability constants for each successive step might decrease because adding more ligands becomes less favorable. But here, β3 is higher than β2, and β4 drops. Maybe that's possible due to some steric effects or changes in structure. But regardless, we have to use the given values.

So proceeding with the calculation, the percentage is approximately 16.92%, which rounds to 17%. But let me check the exact value.

Compute alpha_2:

beta2 is 40, [SCN⁻]^2 is 0.01, alpha_0 is 1/2.3646 ≈ 0.423.

So 40 * 0.01 = 0.4; 0.4 * 0.423 ≈ 0.1692, which is 16.92%. So 16.92% of the total cobalt is present as the dithiocyanato complex. Therefore, the answer is approximately 16.9%, which can be written as 16.9% or 17%. But let me check if the problem expects a precise decimal.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the denominator. Let me recalculate:

1 + 9*0.1 = 1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 40*0.01 = 1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 63*0.001 = 2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 16*0.0001 = 2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

Yes, that's correct. So alpha_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423.

Then alpha_2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 * 0.423 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.423 = 0.4 * 0.423 = 0.1692. So 16.92%.

But let me check if the problem is using logarithms or different units. Wait, no, the stability constants are given as βn values, which are unitless (assuming concentrations are in M). So the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is approximately 17%. But since the problem might expect an exact value, let's compute it more precisely.

Compute 1 / 2.3646:

2.3646 ≈ 2 + 0.3646

1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.5 / 1.1823 ≈ 0.423. Let's compute 1 / 2.3646:

2.3646 * 0.4 = 0.94584

2.3646 * 0.42 = 0.4 * 2.3646 + 0.02 * 2.3646 = 0.94584 + 0.047292 = 0.993132

2.3646 * 0.423 = 0.993132 + 0.003 * 2.3646 ≈ 0.993132 + 0.007094 ≈ 1.000226

So 0.423 * 2.3646 ≈ 1.0002, so alpha_0 ≈ 0.423.

Therefore, alpha_2 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.423 = 0.4 * 0.423 = 0.1692, which is 16.92%.

So, the percentage is 16.92%, which we can round to 16.9% or 17%. Depending on the problem's expectation, but since the given β values are integers, maybe the answer is 17%. However, let's check if there's a miscalculation.

Wait, another way: Let's compute each term in the denominator again:

beta1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

beta2 [SCN]^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

beta3 [SCN]^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

beta4 [SCN]^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Sum: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So alpha_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423

Then, alpha_2 = beta2 [SCN]^2 * alpha_0 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.423 = 0.4 * 0.423 = 0.1692, which is 16.92%.

So, yes, 16.92% is correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 16.9%, which is 16.9%. Depending on significant figures, the given concentrations are 10^-2 M and 0.1 M, which have 1 and 1 significant figure, but the beta values are given as integers (9, 40, 63, 16). However, 40 and 16 have two significant figures, 9 and 63 have one and two. It's a bit inconsistent, but perhaps the answer should be given to two significant figures, so 17%.

But let me check if the problem expects more precise calculation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. Wait, the problem says the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M. If that's the free concentration, then the calculation is correct. If it's the total SCN⁻ concentration, then we need to account for the SCN⁻ bound in complexes. But given that the total Co is 0.01 M, and SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, the amount bound would be up to 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M, which is significant compared to 0.1 M. So if the total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, then free [SCN⁻] would be 0.1 - (1*[Co(SCN)⁺] + 2*[Co(SCN)₂] + 3*[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4*[Co(SCN)₄²⁻]). But this complicates the calculation because free [SCN⁻] is part of the equation. So maybe the problem assumes that [SCN⁻] is in excess, so the free [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M. But given that the total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, and the Co is 0.01 M, the approximation might not hold. Therefore, perhaps we need to consider the total SCN⁻.

Wait, this is a crucial point. If the problem states that the total concentration of SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, then we have to account for the SCN⁻ consumed in the complexes. However, if it's the free SCN⁻ concentration, then we can use 0.1 M directly. The problem says "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M." The notation [SCN⁻] usually denotes the equilibrium concentration (free), but sometimes in problems, especially when in excess, they might give the total concentration. This is ambiguous. Let me check the problem statement again: "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M." The square brackets usually indicate molarity at equilibrium, so free concentration. Therefore, the problem is giving the free SCN⁻ concentration as 0.1 M, so we can proceed as before. Therefore, the initial calculation is correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%. However, let's check with exact calculation.

Alternatively, if the total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, then we need to set up the equation considering that:

Total SCN⁻, c(SCN) = [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.1 M.

But this complicates things because now we have two equations:

1. c(Co) = [Co²⁺] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)₃⁻] + [Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.01 M

2. c(SCN) = [SCN⁻] + [Co(SCN)⁺] + 2[Co(SCN)₂] + 3[Co(SCN)₃⁻] + 4[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = 0.1 M

But solving this system requires expressing all complex concentrations in terms of [Co²⁺] and [SCN⁻], then substituting into the total SCN⁻ equation. This would involve a more complex calculation. However, given that the problem states "[SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M," which is likely the free concentration, we can proceed with the initial approach. But to be thorough, let's check both scenarios.

First scenario: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (free). Then the calculation as before gives alpha_2 ≈ 16.9%.

Second scenario: total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M. Then we need to solve the system.

Let me attempt this.

Let’s denote:

[Co²⁺] = x

[Co(SCN)⁺] = β1 x [SCN] = 9 x [SCN]

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 x [SCN]^2 = 40 x [SCN]^2

[Co(SCN)₃⁻] = β3 x [SCN]^3 = 63 x [SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)₄²⁻] = β4 x [SCN]^4 = 16 x [SCN]^4

Total Co: x + 9x[SCN] + 40x[SCN]^2 + 63x[SCN]^3 + 16x[SCN]^4 = 0.01

Total SCN: [SCN] + 9x[SCN] + 2*40x[SCN]^2 + 3*63x[SCN]^3 + 4*16x[SCN]^4 = 0.1

Let’s denote [SCN] as y. Then:

From Co total:

x(1 + 9y + 40y² + 63y³ + 16y⁴) = 0.01

From SCN total:

y + 9xy + 80xy² + 189xy³ + 64xy⁴ = 0.1

This is a system of two equations with two variables x and y. Solving this would be complicated, but perhaps we can approximate.

Assume that y ≈ 0.1 (as before), then check if the SCN total equation holds.

From Co total equation:

x = 0.01 / (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001) = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.00423

Then, substitute x ≈ 0.00423 and y ≈ 0.1 into the SCN total equation:

y + 9xy + 80xy² + 189xy³ + 64xy⁴

= 0.1 + 9*0.00423*0.1 + 80*0.00423*(0.1)^2 + 189*0.00423*(0.1)^3 + 64*0.00423*(0.1)^4

Calculate each term:

First term: 0.1

Second term: 9 * 0.00423 * 0.1 = 0.9 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.003807

Third term: 80 * 0.00423 * 0.01 = 0.8 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.003384

Fourth term: 189 * 0.00423 * 0.001 = 0.189 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.000798

Fifth term: 64 * 0.00423 * 0.0001 = 0.0064 * 0.00423 ≈ 0.000027

Sum all terms:

0.1 + 0.003807 ≈ 0.103807

0.103807 + 0.003384 ≈ 0.107191

0.107191 + 0.000798 ≈ 0.107989

0.107989 + 0.000027 ≈ 0.108016

But the total SCN should be 0.1 M, but according to this approximation, it's 0.108 M, which is higher. Therefore, our initial assumption that y ≈ 0.1 leads to a total SCN of 0.108 M, which is more than the given 0.1 M. Therefore, the free [SCN⁻] must be lower than 0.1 M.

This means that the initial assumption that [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M is not accurate, and we need to adjust it. Therefore, the problem is more complex and requires solving the two equations.

Let’s attempt to set up the equations:

Let’s denote:

Equation 1: x(1 + 9y + 40y² + 63y³ + 16y⁴) = 0.01

Equation 2: y + x(9y + 80y² + 189y³ + 64y⁴) = 0.1

We can express x from Equation 1:

x = 0.01 / (1 + 9y + 40y² + 63y³ + 16y⁴)

Substitute x into Equation 2:

y + [0.01 / (1 + 9y + 40y² + 63y³ + 16y⁴)] * (9y + 80y² + 189y³ + 64y⁴) = 0.1

This is a single equation in y. Let’s denote the denominator as D = 1 + 9y + 40y² + 63y³ + 16y⁴

Then, Equation 2 becomes:

y + (0.01/D)(9y + 80y² + 189y³ + 64y⁴) = 0.1

Multiply both sides by D:

yD + 0.01(9y + 80y² + 189y³ + 64y⁴) = 0.1D

Bring all terms to one side:

yD + 0.01(9y + 80y² + 189y³ + 64y⁴) - 0.1D = 0

Substitute D:

y(1 + 9y + 40y² + 63y³ + 16y⁴) + 0.01(9y + 80y² + 189y³ + 64y⁴) - 0.1(1 + 9y + 40y² + 63y³ + 16y⁴) = 0

This is quite complicated. Let's expand term by term.

First term: y(1 + 9y + 40y² + 63y³ + 16y⁴) = y + 9y² + 40y³ + 63y⁴ + 16y⁵

Second term: 0.01(9y + 80y² + 189y³ + 64y⁴) = 0.09y + 0.8y² + 1.89y³ + 0.64y⁴

Third term: -0.1(1 + 9y + 40y² + 63y³ + 16y⁴) = -0.1 - 0.9y - 4y² - 6.3y³ - 1.6y⁴

Combine all terms:

y + 9y² + 40y³ + 63y⁴ + 16y⁵ + 0.09y + 0.8y² + 1.89y³ + 0.64y⁴ - 0.1 - 0.9y - 4y² - 6.3y³ - 1.6y⁴ = 0

Combine like terms:

y terms: y + 0.09y - 0.9y = (1 + 0.09 - 0.9)y = 0.19y

y² terms: 9y² + 0.8y² - 4y² = (9 + 0.8 - 4)y² = 5.8y²

y³ terms: 40y³ + 1.89y³ - 6.3y³ = (40 + 1.89 - 6.3)y³ = 35.59y³

y⁴ terms: 63y⁴ + 0.64y⁴ - 1.6y⁴ = (63 + 0.64 - 1.6)y⁴ = 62.04y⁴

y⁵ terms: 16y⁵

Constants: -0.1

So the equation becomes:

0.19y + 5.8y² + 35.59y³ + 62.04y⁴ + 16y⁵ - 0.1 = 0

This is a quintic equation, which is difficult to solve analytically. We can attempt to find a numerical solution. Let's try plugging in y = 0.08 M.

Compute each term:

0.19*0.08 = 0.0152

5.8*(0.08)^2 = 5.8*0.0064 = 0.03712

35.59*(0.08)^3 = 35.59*0.000512 ≈ 0.01823

62.04*(0.08)^4 = 62.04*0.0004096 ≈ 0.02544

16*(0.08)^5 = 16*0.000032768 ≈ 0.000524

Sum these terms:

0.0152 + 0.03712 = 0.05232

0.05232 + 0.01823 ≈ 0.07055

0.07055 + 0.02544 ≈ 0.09599

0.09599 + 0.000524 ≈ 0.09651

Subtract 0.1: 0.09651 - 0.1 = -0.00349

So at y=0.08, the equation is -0.00349.

Try y=0.085:

0.19*0.085 ≈ 0.01615

5.8*(0.085)^2 ≈ 5.8*0.007225 ≈ 0.041905

35.59*(0.085)^3 ≈ 35.59*0.0006141 ≈ 0.02186

62.04*(0.085)^4 ≈ 62.04*0.000522 ≈ 0.0324

16*(0.085)^5 ≈ 16*0.0004437 ≈ 0.0071

Sum:

0.01615 + 0.041905 ≈ 0.058055

0.058055 + 0.02186 ≈ 0.079915

0.079915 + 0.0324 ≈ 0.112315

0.112315 + 0.0071 ≈ 0.119415

Subtract 0.1: 0.119415 - 0.1 = 0.019415

Wait, this is positive. Wait, but when y increases from 0.08 to 0.085, the result goes from -0.00349 to +0.0194. So the root is between y=0.08 and y=0.085.

Let’s try y=0.083:

0.19*0.083 ≈ 0.01577

5.8*(0.083)^2 ≈ 5.8*0.006889 ≈ 0.0400

35.59*(0.083)^3 ≈ 35.59*0.000571 ≈ 0.02033

62.04*(0.083)^4 ≈ 62.04*0.000473 ≈ 0.02935

16*(0.083)^5 ≈ 16*0.000398 ≈ 0.00637

Sum:

0.01577 + 0.0400 ≈ 0.05577

0.05577 + 0.02033 ≈ 0.0761

0.0761 + 0.02935 ≈ 0.10545

0.10545 + 0.00637 ≈ 0.11182

0.11182 - 0.1 = 0.01182

Still positive. Try y=0.082:

0.19*0.082 ≈ 0.01558

5.8*(0.082)^2 ≈ 5.8*0.006724 ≈ 0.0390

35.59*(0.082)^3 ≈ 35.59*0.000551 ≈ 0.01962

62.04*(0.082)^4 ≈ 62.04*0.000452 ≈ 0.02806

16*(0.082)^5 ≈ 16*0.000373 ≈ 0.00597

Sum:

0.01558 + 0.0390 ≈ 0.05458

0.05458 + 0.01962 ≈ 0.0742

0.0742 + 0.02806 ≈ 0.10226

0.10226 + 0.00597 ≈ 0.10823

0.10823 - 0.1 = 0.00823

Still positive. Try y=0.081:

0.19*0.081 ≈ 0.01539

5.8*(0.081)^2 ≈ 5.8*0.006561 ≈ 0.03805

35.59*(0.081)^3 ≈ 35.59*0.000531 ≈ 0.0189

62.04*(0.081)^4 ≈ 62.04*0.000430 ≈ 0.0267

16*(0.081)^5 ≈ 16*0.000348 ≈ 0.00557

Sum:

0.01539 + 0.03805 ≈ 0.05344

0.05344 + 0.0189 ≈ 0.07234

0.07234 + 0.0267 ≈ 0.09904

0.09904 + 0.00557 ≈ 0.10461

0.10461 - 0.1 = 0.00461

Still positive. Try y=0.08:

As before, at y=0.08, total is -0.00349. Wait, no, earlier at y=0.08, the sum was 0.09651 - 0.1 = -0.00349. Wait, but when I tried y=0.08, the sum of terms was 0.09651, which is 0.09651 - 0.1 = -0.00349. Then at y=0.081, sum is 0.10461 - 0.1 = 0.00461. Wait, this inconsistency suggests a miscalculation. Wait, no, when y=0.08, the sum of the terms in the equation is 0.09651, which is 0.09651 - 0.1 = -0.00349. At y=0.081, the sum is 0.10461 - 0.1 = 0.00461. Wait, this can't be, because increasing y from 0.08 to 0.081 increases the sum from -0.00349 to +0.00461. That suggests a root between y=0.08 and y=0.081.

Wait, let's recalculate for y=0.08:

0.19*0.08 = 0.0152

5.8*(0.08)^2 = 5.8*0.0064 = 0.03712

35.59*(0.08)^3 = 35.59*0.000512 ≈ 0.01823

62.04*(0.08)^4 = 62.04*0.0004096 ≈ 0.02544

16*(0.08)^5 = 16*0.000032768 ≈ 0.000524

Sum: 0.0152 + 0.03712 = 0.05232; +0.01823 = 0.07055; +0.02544 = 0.09599; +0.000524 ≈ 0.09651

Total equation: 0.09651 - 0.1 = -0.00349

At y=0.08, equation value is -0.00349

At y=0.081:

0.19*0.081 = 0.01539

5.8*(0.081)^2 = 5.8*0.006561 ≈ 0.03805

35.59*(0.081)^3 ≈ 35.59*0.000531 ≈ 0.0189

62.04*(0.081)^4 ≈ 62.04*0.000430 ≈ 0.0267

16*(0.081)^5 ≈ 16*0.000348 ≈ 0.00557

Sum: 0.01539 + 0.03805 = 0.05344; +0.0189 = 0.07234; +0.0267 = 0.09904; +0.00557 ≈ 0.10461

Equation value: 0.10461 - 0.1 = 000461

So between y=0.08 and y=0.081, the equation crosses zero. Let's use linear approximation.

The difference in y is 0.001 (from 0.08 to 0.081), and the function goes from -0.00349 to +0.00461, a change of 0.0081 over 0.001 y. We need to find delta y such that -0.00349 + delta y * (0.0081 / 0.001) = 0

So delta y = 0.00349 / 8.1 ≈ 0.000431

Therefore, y ≈ 0.08 + 0.000431 ≈ 0.080431

So approximate y ≈ 0.0804 M

Then, compute x from Equation 1:

x = 0.01 / D, where D = 1 + 9y + 40y² + 63y³ + 16y⁴

Compute D at y=0.0804:

First, y=0.0804

y² = (0.0804)^2 ≈ 0.006464

y³ ≈ 0.0804 * 0.006464 ≈ 0.000519

y⁴ ≈ 0.0804 * 0.000519 ≈ 0.0000417

Now compute each term:

1

9y = 9*0.0804 ≈ 0.7236

40y² = 40*0.006464 ≈ 0.25856

63y³ = 63*0.000519 ≈ 0.0327

16y⁴ = 16*0.0000417 ≈ 0.000667

Sum:

1 + 0.7236 = 1.7236

1.7236 + 0.25856 ≈ 1.98216

1.98216 + 0.0327 ≈ 2.01486

2.01486 + 0.000667 ≈ 2.0155

Thus, D ≈ 2.0155

Therefore, x = 0.01 / 2.0155 ≈ 0.00496 M

Now, compute alpha_2 = [Co(SCN)₂]/c(Co) = β2 y² x / c(Co)

Wait, no. Wait, [Co(SCN)₂] = β2 x y²

But c(Co) = 0.01 M, so alpha_2 = β2 x y² / 0.01

Wait, no. Wait, c(Co) = x + β1 x y + β2 x y² + β3 x y³ + β4 x y⁴ = 0.01

Therefore, alpha_2 = β2 x y² / 0.01

So alpha_2 = 40 * 0.00496 * (0.0804)^2 / 0.01

Compute:

First, (0.0804)^2 ≈ 0.006464

Then, 40 * 0.00496 ≈ 0.1984

0.1984 * 0.006464 ≈ 0.001283

Then, 0.001283 / 0.01 = 0.1283, so alpha_2 ≈ 12.83%

This is significantly lower than the previous estimate of 16.9%. Therefore, if we consider that the total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is approximately 12.8%, which is different from the initial assumption.

But this contradicts the problem statement, which says "[SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M." If [SCN⁻] is the free concentration, then the initial calculation holds. If it's the total concentration, then the answer is lower. The problem statement is ambiguous, but typically, in such problems, if the ligand is in excess, the free concentration is approximated as the given concentration. However, in this case, since the total SCN⁻ is only 0.1 M and the Co is 0.01 M, the approximation might not hold. The problem might expect the first approach, but given the significant difference in results, this is a critical point.

But the problem says "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M." The use of square brackets usually denotes the equilibrium concentration, i.e., free SCN⁻. Therefore, the correct approach is to take [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, leading to alpha_2 ≈ 16.9%. However, given that the problem might have intended the total SCN⁻ to be 0.1 M, leading to a lower percentage. This is a ambiguity in the problem statement.

Given that the problem is from a textbook or exam, and the use of square brackets, it's more likely that [SCN⁻] refers to the free concentration. Therefore, the answer is approximately 16.9%, which rounds to 17%. However, the exact answer is approximately 16.9%.

But to confirm, let's check with the exact calculation when considering total SCN⁻ = 0.1 M. We found y ≈ 0.0804 M, and alpha_2 ≈ 12.8%. However, this requires solving the complex equation, which might be beyond the intended scope of the problem. Given that the problem provides stability constants and asks for the percentage, it's more likely that they expect the first approach where [SCN⁻] is taken as 0.1 M (free), leading to 16.9%.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 16.9%, which can be written as 16.9% or 17%. Given the options, perhaps the answer is 17%. However, to be precise, the exact value is 16.9%.

But let me check once more with the initial assumption:

If [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M (free), then:

alpha_0 = 1 / (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001) ≈ 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423

alpha_2 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.423 ≈ 0.1692, so 16.92%

Therefore, the answer is 16.9%.

But the problem might expect rounding to two significant figures, so 17%.

However, given the beta values are given as integers, and the concentrations have one significant figure (10^-2 M is 0.01 M, one sig fig; 0.1 M is one sig fig), the answer should be reported with one significant figure, which would be 20%. But wait, 16.9% is approximately 17%, which is two sig figs. But the given data has beta1=9 (one sig fig), beta2=40 (one or two? 40 could be one or two), beta3=63 (two), beta4=16 (two). The concentrations are 10^-2 M (one sig fig) and 0.1 M (one sig fig). Therefore, the answer should have one significant figure, so 20%? But 16.9% is closer to 20%? No, 16.9% is 17%, which is two sig figs. This is confusing. Alternatively, if the problem allows two sig figs, then 17%. But given the ambiguity in the problem statement regarding [SCN⁻], and the potential for different interpretations, it's safer to state that the percentage is approximately 17%.

But given that when considering total SCN⁻, the answer is approximately 12.8%, which would round to 13%. This discrepancy shows the importance of clarifying whether [SCN⁻] is free or total. Given the problem's phrasing, I think the intended answer is 17%, assuming [SCN⁻] is free.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{17\%}.


**Final Answer**
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is \boxed{17\%}.

α₀ = \frac{1}{1 + β₁[S^-CN] + β₂[S^-CN]^2 + β₃[S^-CN]^3 + β₄[S^-CN]^4}
\]

**Calculation:**
\[
α₀ = \frac{1}{1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4} = \frac{1}{2.2043} ≈ 0.4536
\]

**Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] (α₂):**
\[
α₂ = β₂ \cdot [S^-CN]^2 \cdot α₀ = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 \cdot 0.4536 ≈ 0.1814
\]

**Percentage:**
\[
\text{Percentage} = α₂ \times 100 = \boxed{18.1\%}
\]

The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt species is approximately **18.1%**.

This calculation seems straightforward but requires verifying the assumption regarding the free thiocyanate concentration. Given the large excess of thiocyanate (0.1 M total with only 10^-2 M total cobalt), the assumption that [SCN⁻] ≈ 0.1 M is reasonable. If significant binding occurred, this may not hold; however, given the logβ values, even if all cobalt were bound, the bound SCN would be at most 4*10^-2, which is negligible compared to 0.1 M. Therefore, the approximation is acceptable, and the resulting percentage is about 16.92%, which rounds to 17.0% when accounting for possible calculation approximations.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)₂) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we start by considering the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \(10^{-2}\) M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are \(\beta_1 = 9\), \(\beta_2 = 40\), \(\beta_3 = 63\), and \(\beta_4 = 16\).

The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate the denominator for the fraction of free Co²⁺ (\(\alpha_0\))**:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

2. **Determine \(\alpha_0\)**:
   \[
   \alpha_0 = \frac{1}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.4229
   \]

3. **Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\(\alpha_2\))**:
   \[
   \alpha_2 = \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 \alpha_0 = 40(0.1)^2 \times 0.4229 = 40 \times 0.01 \times 0.4229 = 0.4 \times 0.4229 \approx 0.16916
   \]

4. **Convert \(\alpha_2\) to a percentage**:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 0.16916 \times 100 \approx 16.916\%
   \]

After considering the precision of the given data and rounding conventions, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16.9\%}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

So, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is approximately 16.92%.

Wait, but let me verify each calculation step.

First, let me compute the denominator again step by step:

Term 1: beta1 * [SCN⁻] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term 2: beta2 * [SCN⁻]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4

Term 3: beta3 * [SCN⁻]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

Term 4: beta4 * [SCN⁻]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Adding up all terms:

1 (Term 0) + 0.9 (Term 1) = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 (Term 2) = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 (Term 3) = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 (Term 4) ≈ 2.3646

Therefore, alpha_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4229

Then, alpha_2 is beta2 * [SCN⁻]^2 * alpha_0 = 40 * (0.1)^2 * 0.4229 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.4229 = 0.4 * 0.4229 ≈ 0.16916

So approximately 16.916%, which rounds to about 16.9%. Since the problem is giving beta values as integers but the question asks for percentage, probably need to check if the approximation is correct. Alternatively, perhaps considering the excess SCN⁻, but here [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, which is 10 times higher than the total Co concentration (0.01 M). Each Co can bind up to 4 SCN⁻, so 0.01 M Co would take at maximum 0.04 M SCN⁻. Since the total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, free SCN⁻ would be approximately 0.1 - 0.04 = 0.06 M. But in reality, since not all Co would be in the highest complex, the actual [SCN⁻] free is higher. However, in my initial assumption, I used 0.1 M as free [SCN⁻], which may not be correct. Wait, maybe I need to consider the actual SCN⁻ consumption.

Let me consider the total SCN⁻ concentration. The total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M. But some is bound to Co complexes. The total bound SCN⁻ would be sum over n=1 to 4 of n * [Co(SCN)_n^{(2-n)+}]. The total Co is 0.01 M, so:

Total SCN⁻ bound = sum_{n=1}^4 n * [Co(SCN)_n] = sum_{n=1}^4 n * beta_n [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^n

But [Co²⁺] = alpha_0 * c(Co) = alpha_0 * 0.01 M

Therefore, total SCN⁻ bound = sum_{n=1}^4 n * beta_n * (0.01 * alpha_0) * [SCN⁻]^n

But this seems recursive because [SCN⁻] is the free concentration. So to find the exact value, we need to solve for [SCN⁻] considering both the total SCN⁻ and the bound SCN⁻. Let's denote the total SCN⁻ as 0.1 M = [SCN⁻] + sum_{n=1}^4 n * [Co(SCN)_n]

But [Co(SCN)_n] = beta_n [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^n

Hence, 0.1 = [SCN⁻] + sum_{n=1}^4 n * beta_n [Co²⁺][SCN⁻]^n

But [Co²⁺] = alpha_0 * 0.01 = (1 / (1 + sum_{m=1}^4 beta_m [SCN⁻]^m )) * 0.01

This becomes a nonlinear equation in [SCN⁻], which might be complicated. However, since the total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M and the Co concentration is 0.01 M, even if all Co were in the Co(SCN)₄²⁻ complex, that would consume 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M SCN⁻, leaving 0.06 M free SCN⁻. However, in reality, not all Co is in the highest complex, so the actual free SCN⁻ is higher than 0.06. But since the problem states [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, which is higher than 0.06, maybe the given [SCN⁻] is the total concentration, but I need to check the problem statement.

The problem states: "where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M." The wording is a bit ambiguous. If "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M" refers to the total SCN⁻ (free + bound), then we need to take into account the bound SCN⁻. However, if the [SCN⁻] given is the free concentration, then the initial approach is correct.

This is a crucial point. Let's re-examine the problem statement: "We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M." It says "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". Depending on the convention, in coordination chemistry, when they say "the concentration of SCN⁻ is 0.1 M", it might refer to the total concentration (including bound). But in the context of stability constants, the beta values are defined in terms of the free ligand concentration. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M is the free concentration, which is in excess, so the bound SCN⁻ is negligible compared to the total. But in reality, with Co = 0.01 M and each complex binding up to 4 SCN⁻, the maximum bound SCN⁻ is 0.04 M, so total SCN⁻ would be 0.1 + 0.04 = 0.14 M? Wait, the problem states that the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M. If that's the case, then it's ambiguous. If the problem states that the total SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, then we need to consider that. But if the problem states that the free SCN⁻ is 0.1 M, then the initial approach is correct.

The problem is translated as: "the [SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". If this is the analytical concentration (total), then the free SCN⁻ is less. If it's the equilibrium concentration (free), then proceed as before. But in many cases, when the ligand is in excess, the free concentration can be approximated as the total. For example, if SCN⁻ is 0.1 M and Co is 0.01 M, even if all Co is complexed with 4 SCN⁻, that's 0.04 M, so free SCN⁻ would be 0.1 - 0.04 = 0.06 M. However, if the problem says that [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, perhaps they mean that's the free concentration. But this is unclear.

Given that in the problem statement, they might be considering that the thiocyanate is in large excess, such that the free SCN⁻ is approximately 0.1 M. Then, proceeding with the initial calculation where alpha_0 = 1 / (1 + beta1*[SCN] + beta2*[SCN]^2 + beta3*[SCN]^3 + beta4*[SCN]^4), leading to alpha_2 as calculated.

Alternatively, if [SCN⁻] is the total concentration, then we need to set up an equation where [SCN⁻]_total = [SCN⁻] + sum(n * [Co(SCN)_n])

But this would require solving for [SCN⁻] using:

0.1 = [SCN⁻] + sum_{n=1}^4 n * beta_n * [Co²⁺] * [SCN⁻]^n

And [Co²⁺] = c(Co) / (1 + sum_{m=1}^4 beta_m [SCN⁻]^m )

Substituting [Co²⁺] into the SCN⁻ equation:

0.1 = [SCN⁻] + sum_{n=1}^4 n * beta_n * (0.01 / (1 + sum_{m=1}^4 beta_m [SCN⁻]^m )) * [SCN⁻]^n

This equation needs to be solved numerically. Let's attempt this.

Let me denote:

Denominator = 1 + beta1*S + beta2*S² + beta3*S³ + beta4*S⁴, where S is [SCN⁻].

Total SCN⁻ equation:

0.1 = S + sum_{n=1}^4 n * beta_n * (0.01 / Denominator) * S^n

Which is:

0.1 = S + (0.01 / Denominator) * sum_{n=1}^4 n * beta_n * S^n

But sum_{n=1}^4 n * beta_n * S^n = beta1*S + 2*beta2*S² + 3*beta3*S³ + 4*beta4*S⁴

Thus:

0.1 = S + (0.01 / Denominator) * (beta1*S + 2*beta2*S² + 3*beta3*S³ + 4*beta4*S⁴ )

Substituting Denominator:

Denominator = 1 + beta1*S + beta2*S² + beta3*S³ + beta4*S⁴

So:

0.1 = S + (0.01 (beta1*S + 2*beta2*S² + 3*beta3*S³ + 4*beta4*S⁴ )) / (1 + beta1*S + beta2*S² + beta3*S³ + beta4*S⁴ )

This equation is complicated. Let me attempt to approximate S.

First, let's try assuming S ≈ 0.06 M (as initial guess). Let's compute RHS.

Compute Denominator:

1 + 9*0.06 + 40*(0.06)^2 + 63*(0.06)^3 + 16*(0.06)^4

First term: 1

Second term: 9*0.06 = 0.54

Third term: 40*0.0036 = 0.144

Fourth term: 63*0.000216 ≈ 0.013608

Fifth term: 16*0.00001296 ≈ 0.00020736

Sum: 1 + 0.54 = 1.54; +0.144 = 1.684; +0.013608 ≈ 1.6976; +0.000207 ≈ 1.6978

Denominator ≈ 1.6978

Compute numerator of the second term:

beta1*S + 2*beta2*S² + 3*beta3*S³ + 4*beta4*S⁴

= 9*0.06 + 2*40*(0.06)^2 + 3*63*(0.06)^3 + 4*16*(0.06)^4

Compute term by term:

First term: 9*0.06 = 0.54

Second term: 2*40*0.0036 = 80*0.0036 = 0.288

Third term: 3*63*0.000216 = 189*0.000216 ≈ 0.040824

Fourth term: 4*16*0.00001296 ≈ 64*0.00001296 ≈ 0.00082944

Sum: 0.54 + 0.288 = 0.828; +0.040824 ≈ 0.8688; +0.000829 ≈ 0.8696

Multiply by 0.01 and divide by Denominator:

0.01 * 0.8696 / 1.6978 ≈ 0.008696 / 1.6978 ≈ 0.005123

Thus, RHS = S + 0.005123 = 0.06 + 0.005123 ≈ 0.065123, which is less than 0.1. So we need a larger S.

Let me try S = 0.08 M.

Denominator:

1 + 9*0.08 + 40*(0.08)^2 + 63*(0.08)^3 + 16*(0.08)^4

1 + 0.72 + 40*0.0064 + 63*0.000512 + 16*0.0004096

Calculate:

1 + 0.72 = 1.72

40*0.0064 = 0.256 → 1.72 + 0.256 = 1.976

63*0.000512 ≈ 0.032256 → 1.976 + 0.032256 ≈ 2.008256

16*0.0004096 ≈ 0.0065536 → 2.008256 + 0.0065536 ≈ 2.0148

Numerator for second term:

beta1*S + 2*beta2*S² + 3*beta3*S³ + 4*beta4*S⁴

9*0.08 + 2*40*(0.08)^2 + 3*63*(0.08)^3 + 4*16*(0.08)^4

= 0.72 + 2*40*0.0064 + 3*63*0.000512 + 4*16*0.0004096

= 0.72 + 0.512 + 0.096768 + 0.00262144

= 0.72 + 0.512 = 1.232 + 0.096768 = 1.328768 + 0.002621 ≈ 1.331389

Multiply by 0.01: 0.01331389

Divide by Denominator: 0.01331389 / 2.0148 ≈ 0.00661

Thus, RHS = S + 0.00661 = 0.08 + 0.00661 ≈ 0.08661 < 0.1

Need to try higher S.

Try S = 0.09 M.

Denominator:

1 + 9*0.09 + 40*(0.09)^2 + 63*(0.09)^3 + 16*(0.09)^4

1 + 0.81 + 40*0.0081 + 63*0.000729 + 16*0.0006561

1 + 0.81 = 1.81

40*0.0081 = 0.324 → 1.81 + 0.324 = 2.134

63*0.000729 ≈ 0.045927 → 2.134 + 0.045927 ≈ 2.179927

16*0.0006561 ≈ 0.0104976 → 2.179927 + 0.0104976 ≈ 2.1904246

Numerator second term:

9*0.09 + 2*40*(0.09)^2 + 3*63*(0.09)^3 + 4*16*(0.09)^4

= 0.81 + 2*40*0.0081 + 3*63*0.000729 + 4*16*0.0006561

= 0.81 + 0.648 + 0.137781 + 0.0419904

= 0.81 + 0.648 = 1.458 + 0.137781 = 1.595781 + 0.0419904 ≈ 1.637771

Multiply by 0.01: 0.01637771

Divide by Denominator: 0.01637771 / 2.1904246 ≈ 0.007476

Thus, RHS = S + 0.007476 = 0.09 + 0.007476 ≈ 0.097476 ≈ 0.0975 < 0.1

Close. Try S = 0.095.

Denominator:

1 + 9*0.095 + 40*(0.095)^2 + 63*(0.095)^3 + 16*(0.095)^4

= 1 + 0.855 + 40*0.009025 + 63*0.0008574 + 16*0.0008145

Calculate:

1 + 0.855 = 1.855

40*0.009025 = 0.361 → 1.855 + 0.361 = 2.216

63*0.0008574 ≈ 0.0540162 → 2.216 + 0.054016 ≈ 2.270016

16*0.0008145 ≈ 0.013032 → 2.270016 + 0.013032 ≈ 2.283048

Numerator second term:

9*0.095 + 2*40*(0.095)^2 + 3*63*(0.095)^3 + 4*16*(0.095)^4

= 0.855 + 2*40*0.009025 + 3*63*0.0008574 + 4*16*0.0008145

= 0.855 + 0.722 + 0.162394 + 0.052128

= 0.855 + 0.722 = 1.577 + 0.162394 ≈ 1.739394 + 0.052128 ≈ 1.791522

Multiply by 0.01: 0.01791522

Divide by Denominator: 0.01791522 / 2.283048 ≈ 0.00785

RHS = 0.095 + 0.00785 ≈ 0.10285 > 0.1

So at S = 0.095 M, RHS is approximately 0.10285, which is higher than 0.1. We need S between 0.09 and 0.095.

Let me try S = 0.093 M.

Denominator:

1 + 9*0.093 + 40*(0.093)^2 + 63*(0.093)^3 + 16*(0.093)^4

= 1 + 0.837 + 40*0.008649 + 63*0.000804357 + 16*0.000075

Wait, actually compute each term:

9*0.093 = 0.837

40*(0.093)^2 = 40*(0.008649) = 0.34596

63*(0.093)^3 = 63*(0.093*0.093*0.093) ≈ 63*(0.000804) ≈ 0.050652

16*(0.093)^4 ≈ 16*(0.000075) ≈ 0.0012

Sum Denominator: 1 + 0.837 = 1.837 + 0.34596 ≈ 2.18296 + 0.050652 ≈ 2.233612 + 0.0012 ≈ 2.234812

Numerator second term:

9*0.093 + 2*40*(0.093)^2 + 3*63*(0.093)^3 + 4*16*(0.093)^4

= 0.837 + 2*40*0.008649 + 3*63*0.000804 + 4*16*0.000075

= 0.837 + 0.69192 + 0.151956 + 0.0048

= 0.837 + 0.69192 ≈ 1.52892 + 0.151956 ≈ 1.680876 + 0.0048 ≈ 1.685676

Multiply by 0.01: 0.01685676

Divide by Denominator: 0.01685676 / 2.234812 ≈ 0.00754

Thus, RHS = 0.093 + 0.00754 ≈ 0.10054 ≈ 0.1005, which is very close to 0.1.

Therefore, approximate solution S ≈ 0.093 M.

Thus, free SCN⁻ is approximately 0.093 M. Now, compute alpha_0 and alpha_2 with this S.

Denominator = 1 + 9*0.093 + 40*(0.093)^2 + 63*(0.093)^3 + 16*(0.093)^4 ≈ 2.2348 (from previous calculation)

Therefore, alpha_0 = 1 / 2.2348 ≈ 0.4475

Then alpha_2 = beta2 * S² * alpha_0 = 40 * (0.093)^2 * 0.4475

Compute (0.093)^2 = 0.008649

40 * 0.008649 ≈ 0.34596

Multiply by 0.4475: 0.34596 * 0.4475 ≈ 0.1548

Thus, alpha_2 ≈ 0.1548, so 15.48%. Previously, when assuming S = 0.1 M, alpha_2 was ~16.9%, but considering the actual S ≈ 0.093 M, the alpha_2 is ~15.5%.

However, this method required iterative approximation. The problem might expect using the given SCN⁻ concentration as the free concentration, i.e., 0.1 M, leading to the initial calculation of ~16.9%.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and the beta values are actually stepwise constants, not cumulative. Wait, the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16". Stability constants (βn) typically refer to the cumulative (overall) formation constants. However, in some contexts, particularly older literature, βn can refer to the stepwise constants. But standard IUPAC notation uses βn for overall and Kn for stepwise. For example, β1 = K1, β2 = K1*K2, etc.

But given that β4=16 is smaller than β3=63, it's a bit odd. Typically, cumulative stability constants increase with each step or might decrease if the higher complexes are less stable. In this case, the cumulative constants go from β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that would mean Co²⁺ + 4 SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)₄²⁻, β4=16. But β3=63 is higher than β4=16. This suggests that the fourth complex is less stable, leading to a decrease in the cumulative constant, which is unusual. This might indicate a typo in the problem statement or that the constants are stepwise.

Wait, if they are stepwise constants (K1 to K4), then cumulative βn would be:

β1 = K1

β2 = K1*K2

β3 = K1*K2*K3

β4 = K1*K2*K3*K4

But if the given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16, then the stepwise constants would be:

K1 = β1 = 9

K2 = β2 / β1 = 40 / 9 ≈ 4.444

K3 = β3 / β2 = 63 / 40 = 1.575

K4 = β4 / β3 = 16 / 63 ≈ 0.254

This would imply that each stepwise constant after the third is decreasing, which is possible as higher coordination can become less favorable. If that's the case, then the cumulative constants are as given, and my previous approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem lists log β values? No, the values 9, 40, 63, 16 are plausible as stability constants (though unitless, assuming concentrations in M). For example, Co(II) thiocyanate complexes are known to have such stability constants. The fourth complex might indeed be less stable due to steric hindrance or electronic factors.

Assuming the given βn are cumulative, then proceeding as before.

However, the problem's mention of "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes" refers to the Co(SCN)₂⁰ complex. The blue color is associated with this complex. In reality, Co(II) thiocyanate complexes in solution can exhibit different colors; the tetrahedral [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ is typically blue, but maybe in this context, the problem states that the dithiocyanato complex is blue.

But regardless, the calculation method remains the same.

Given that considering the free SCN⁻ as 0.1 M gives a higher estimate (16.9%), but using the total SCN⁻ = 0.1 M gives a lower estimate (15.5%). Which one is correct?

The problem states "[SCN⁻] concentration is 0.1 M". If this is the total SCN⁻ (free + bound), then the second approach is necessary. If it's the free SCN⁻, then the first approach is correct.

In many problems, when the ligand concentration is given without qualification, it's often the total concentration. However, in the context of stability constants, calculations usually require free ligand concentration. This might be a trick in the problem to check if we consider the ligand consumption.

Given that the problem provides β1 to β4, which are cumulative stability constants, and asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, the answer likely expects the use of free SCN⁻ concentration. However, since the problem states the [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M, but doesn't specify if it's free or total, this is ambiguous.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's written: "the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M". The square brackets usually denote the equilibrium concentration, i.e., free ion concentration. Therefore, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M refers to the free thiocyanate concentration. Therefore, we can safely proceed under the assumption that [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M is the free concentration, and the earlier calculation (≈16.9%) is correct.

Hence, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is approximately 16.9%.

But let's confirm with precise calculation.

Alpha_0 = 1 / (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4 )

Compute denominator:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; +0.4 = 2.3; +0.063 = 2.363; +0.0016 = 2.3646

Thus, alpha_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4229

Alpha_2 = 40*(0.1)^2*0.4229 = 40*0.01*0.4229 = 0.4*0.4229 ≈ 0.16916, so 16.916%

Rounded to two decimal places, 16.92%. The problem might expect two significant figures, so 17%.

However, given the beta values are given as integers, maybe the answer is 17%.

But let me check with exact fractions.

Denominator:

1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016

= 1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So exact value.

alpha_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4229

alpha_2 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.4229 = 0.16916

So approximately 16.916%, which is approximately 16.9% or 17%.

Given the options, maybe 17%.

However, given the exact calculation, 0.16916 is 16.916%, so it's more precise to write 16.9%.

But let me verify once again. The problem gives beta values as exact integers. The free [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. So:

beta1 = 9

beta2 = 40

beta3 = 63

beta4 = 16

So:

Denominator D = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4

= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016

= 2.3646

Therefore, alpha_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4229

alpha_2 = (beta2 * (0.1)^2) / D = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916, which is 16.916%.

Converting to percentage: 16.916%.

So, rounding to two decimal places, 16.92%, but usually, in such contexts, one or two significant figures might be expected. However, given the problem uses two decimal places for concentrations (10^-2 M, 0.1 M), maybe two decimal places in the answer. So 16.92%.

But the answer is likely expecting rounding to the nearest whole number, so 17%, but the precise answer is approximately 16.9%.

But I need to check if there's a miscalculation.

Wait, in the denominator, is the coefficient for beta4 correct? The term is beta4*[SCN⁻]^4 = 16*(0.1)^4 = 16*0.0001 = 0.0016. Yes.

All terms are correct.

Alternatively, maybe the complexes are different. For example, sometimes the dithiocyanato complex is a different isomer or in a different geometry, but I don't think that affects the calculation here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that the blue complex is actually the tetrahedral [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻, which is commonly blue. But the problem specifically says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN⁻ ligands. Maybe in this case, the problem states it's blue, so take it as correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the intended complex is the tetrathiocyanato, but regardless, the calculation for n=2 is correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 16.9%, which can be written as 17% if rounded.

But to check, let's compute 0.16916 * 100 = 16.916%.

Depending on the problem's requirement, it might need one decimal place, so 16.9%, or two, 16.92%, but since in chemistry often two significant figures are used, 17%.

But since the given data (beta values) are integers, maybe the answer is an integer. However, the precise calculation gives 16.916%, which is approximately 16.9%. If forced to give an integer, 17%.

But the problem may accept 16.9% or 17%.

However, let's see what the exact value is.

Denominator D=2.3646

alpha_2 = 40*(0.1)^2 / D = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916

Multiply by 100: 16.916%

So, it's approximately 16.9%, which is likely the answer they expect. Therefore, the percentage is approximately 16.9%.

But perhaps using more precise division:

0.4 / 2.3646

Calculate 2.3646 × 0.16916 ≈ 0.4?

Yes, 2.3646 × 0.16916 ≈ 0.4.

Thus, the percentage is 16.916%.

The problem may require rounding to two decimal places, so 16.92%, but if not specified, 17% is acceptable. However, considering the exact calculation, 16.9% is more precise.

But let's see, the answer needs to be boxed. The question says "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species". Therefore, the answer is approximately 16.9%, which is approximately 17%. However, to match the precise calculation without rounding during steps, it's 16.9%.

But I need to verify once again:

alpha_0 = 1 / (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*0.01 + 63*0.001 + 16*0.0001) = 1 / (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4229

Then alpha_2 = beta2 * [SCN]^2 * alpha_0 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.4229 = 0.4 * 0.4229 = 0.16916.

Yes, this is correct. Therefore, 16.916%.

If the problem expects three significant figures, 16.9%, otherwise 17%. Given that the total Co is 10^-2 (one significant figure), but the SCN⁻ is 0.1 M (one significant figure), but the beta constants are given as integers (one or two significant figures). However, the beta values are 9 (1 sig fig), 40 (1 sig fig?), 63 (2 sig figs), 16 (2 sig figs). It's ambiguous. If they are exact values (as in, β1=9.0, β2=40.0, etc.), then maybe two decimal places. But given the context of stability constants, which are often reported with varying significant figures, but here they are given as integers. Thus, it's safer to go with two significant figures, so 17%.

But the calculated value is approximately 16.9%, which is three significant figures. If the problem allows, 16.9% is accurate. However, in the absence of specific instructions, either could be acceptable. Considering the options, maybe the answer is 17%.

But let me check standard practice. In coordination chemistry problems like this, unless told otherwise, usually two significant figures are common. However, given that the calculation leads to approximately 16.9%, which is very close to 17%, but strictly speaking, it's 16.9%.

Wait, another way: If all terms in the denominator have two decimal places (from the given beta and SCN⁻ concentration), then the denominator is 2.3646, which is approximately 2.36 (three significant figures). Then alpha_0 is 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.423 (three sig figs). Then alpha_2 is 0.4 * 0.423 = 0.1692, which is 16.92%, which would round to 16.9% or 17% depending on the desired sig figs.

However, given the problem's data, the concentrations are given as 10^-2 M (one sig fig) and 0.1 M (one sig fig). The beta values are given as integers, which are exact? Or are they approximate? If they are exact (e.g., β1=9.00, etc.), then the answer can have more sig figs. Otherwise, if all data has one sig fig, the answer should be 20%, but that contradicts.

But 10^-2 M is 0.01 M (one sig fig?), but written as 10^-2, which is one sig fig. Similarly, 0.1 M is one sig fig. However, the beta values are integers: β1=9 (1 sig fig), β2=40 (1 sig fig), β3=63 (2 sig figs), β4=16 (2 sig figs). This is inconsistent. It's possible that β1=9.0, β2=4.0×10^1, β3=6.3×10^1, β4=1.6×10^1, implying two sig figs for β3 and β4, and one for β1 and β2. If that's the case, the answer should have two sig figs, giving 17%.

Alternatively, if all beta values are considered exact (as in the problem states them as precise values), then we can keep more decimals. But the problem doesn't specify.

Given the context of such problems in exams or textbooks, it's common to present the answer to two or three significant figures. Here, the calculation gives 16.916%, which is approximately 16.9%. So I would present it as 16.9%.

But perhaps check if any step had a miscalculation:

alpha_0 = 1 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4229

alpha_2 = 40 * 0.1^2 * 0.4229 = 40 * 0.01 * 0.4229 = 0.4 * 0.4229 = 0.16916

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the exact value is 16.916%.

If I were to write this with two decimal places, it's 16.92%.

But perhaps the answer is simply 17% considering rounding conventions.

However, since the problem gives β values as integers and concentrations with one decimal place (0.1 M), the appropriate number of significant figures would be two, leading to 17%.

But I need to check the exact calculation once more.

Total percentage:

alpha_2 = (beta2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + beta1 [SCN] + beta2 [SCN]^2 + beta3 [SCN]^3 + beta4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is 40*(0.1)^2 / (2.3646) = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916, so 16.916%.

If I multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals:

0.4 / 2.3646 = (40 / 10) / (23646 / 10000) = (40/10) * (10000/23646) ≈ (40000) / 23646 ≈ 1.692, which when multiplied by 10 (because we had 0.4 = 40/100), wait, maybe this approach is confusing.

Alternatively, using fractions:

0.4 / 2.3646 = (2/5) / (23646/10000) = (2/5) * (10000/23646) = (20000) / (118230) ≈ 0.16916.

Regardless, the precise value is approximately 16.916%, which is 16.9% when rounded to three significant figures or 17% to two.

Given that 16.916% is closer to 17% than 16.9%, but in terms of decimal places, 16.9% is one decimal place. If we take the initial data into account, [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M (one decimal place), so the answer should be reported to two significant figures, hence 17%.

But I might be overcomplicating. The important thing is that the precise calculation gives approximately 16.9%, which can be written as 16.9% or 17%, depending on the required precision.

Given that in most chemical calculations, two significant figures are standard unless more are justified, and here the given β3 and β4 have two significant figures, the answer should have two significant figures, hence 17%.

However, to adhere strictly to the calculation, 16.916% is the exact value. Depending on the problem's expectation, either could be acceptable. But since in the initial assumption we considered [SCN⁻] as 0.1 M (free), leading to 16.9%, and if considering the total [SCN⁻] as 0.1 M, we get approximately 15.5%. But the problem states [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, which is likely free, leading to 16.9%.

Thus, the answer is 16.9%.

But to confirm once more:

Denominator: 2.3646

alpha_2: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.16916

Multiply by 100: 16.916%.

Rounded to two decimal places: 16.92%, but typically, one decimal place is sufficient for such percentages unless specified. Hence, 16.9%.

Alternatively, the problem might expect an exact fractional value.

Wait, 0.4 / 2.3646 = 0.16916. If we compute this fraction:

0.4 / 2.3646 = (0.4 * 10000) / (2.3646 * 10000) = 4000 / 23646 ≈ 0.16916.

But this doesn't simplify to a neat fraction. Therefore, decimal is the way to go.

Considering that in multiple choice or numerical answer settings, 16.9% or 17% could be options. Given that 16.916% is very close to 17%, but strictly speaking, under the precision given, 16.9% is more accurate.

However, since in the problem statement, all beta values are integers, and concentrations are given to one decimal place, the answer should be 17% when rounded appropriately.

But in conclusion, the most precise answer is approximately 16.9%, but depending on rounding conventions, 17% is acceptable.

But given the options in the problem, which probably expects a numerical value, I would go with 17%.

But to check, let's see an example. If beta values were, say, β2=40, and [SCN⁻]=0.1, then alpha_2 is 40*(0.1)^2 / D. If D=2.3646, then 0.4 / 2.3646=16.9%.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{17\%} or \boxed{16.9\%}. Given that 16.916% is very close to 17%, but to adhere to the calculation steps without rounding early, it's 16.9%. However, considering the problem's data, 17% is more appropriate.

Wait, but let me check the original problem statement again. It says: "the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M."

If [SCN⁻] is the free concentration, then the answer is 16.9%. If it's the total, then 15.5%. Since the problem uses square brackets, which usually denote equilibrium concentrations, it's likely free concentration. Hence, 16.9%.

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 16.9%, which can be written as 16.9% or 17%. Given the options in the problem's context, maybe 17% is the expected answer. But to be precise, 16.9%.

But the problem might have intended for the student to approximate and report 17%.

However, given that the exact calculation is 16.916%, the answer is 16.9%.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{16.9\%}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{16.9\%}
