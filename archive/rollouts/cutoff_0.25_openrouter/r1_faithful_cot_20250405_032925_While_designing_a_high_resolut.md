# Original Question

While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.

What can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?

When Mike measured the mean free path of gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum (λ₁), it was based on gas-gas collisions. However, when he introduced the electron beam, the mean free path shifted to λ₂, which pertains to **electron-gas molecule collisions**. Here's the critical reasoning:

1. **Mean Free Path Formula**:  
   - For gas molecules (λ₁):  
     \[
     \lambda_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \, n \sigma_{\text{gas-gas}}}
     \]  
     Here, \( \sigma_{\text{gas-gas}} \) is the collision cross-section between gas molecules (e.g., proportional to \( \pi d^2 \), where \( d \) is the molecular diameter).  
   - For electrons (λ₂):  
     \[
     \lambda_2 = \frac{1}{n \sigma_{\text{electron-gas}}}
     \]  
     \( \sigma_{\text{electron-gas}} \) is the cross-section for electrons scattering off gas molecules.

2. **Key Difference**:  
   - Electrons are point particles with significantly **smaller interaction cross-sections** (\( \sigma_{\text{electron-gas}} \)) compared to gas molecules. While gas-gas collisions involve larger targets, electrons interact with gas molecules via much weaker (and often shorter-range) forces, leading to \( \sigma_{\text{electron-gas}} \ll \sigma_{\text{gas-gas}} \).  

3. **Impact on λ**:  
   Since \( \lambda \propto 1/(n\sigma) \), and \( \sigma_{\text{electron-gas}} \) is smaller than \( \sigma_{\text{gas-gas}} \), the electron mean free path \( \lambda_2 \) becomes **much longer** than \( \lambda_1 \). Even relativistic effects (at 1000 kV) reinforce this by reducing scattering probabilities due to shorter de Broglie wavelengths, further lowering \( \sigma_{\text{electron-gas}} \).

**Conclusion**: \( \lambda_2 > \lambda_1 \). The electron beam experiences fewer collisions, resulting in a longer mean free path compared to gas molecules in the same vacuum.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the relationship between λ1 and λ2 here. Let me start by recalling what the mean free path means. The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. In the first scenario, Mike calculated λ1 for gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum. That's the regular mean free path where the gas molecules are colliding with each other. 

But when the electron beam is turned on, the mean free path λ2 is different. Wait, why would that be? The problem states that the temperature remains the same, so thermal motion of gas molecules might not change. However, the mean free path being talked about here must be for the electrons, not the gas molecules. That must be the key. So initially, λ1 is the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other. When the electron beam is introduced, λ2 would be the mean free path of the electrons moving through the gas. Since electrons are much smaller and moving at high velocities (since the accelerating voltage is 1000 kV), their mean free path would be different.

Let me think about the formula for mean free path. For a particle moving through a gas, the mean free path depends on the number density of the gas molecules, the cross-sectional area of the particles, and maybe the relative speed between them. The formula is λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. 

For the gas molecules themselves colliding with each other, the cross-section would be based on the size of the gas molecules (say, diameter d), comparable to each other, so σ1 = πd². But for electrons, which are point particles, the cross-section for scattering with gas molecules (σ2) might be different. Wait, but electrons do interact with gas molecules via Coulomb interactions or other forces. The cross-section might be smaller or larger depending on the interaction probability. 

But considering the size difference, electrons are much smaller than gas molecules, so the cross-section for electron-gas molecule collisions would be much smaller than gas-gas collisions. Thus, since λ is inversely proportional to nσ, if σ2 is smaller than σ1, λ2 would be larger than λ1. Therefore, the electrons' mean free path λ2 is longer than the gas molecules' mean free path λ1. So maybe λ2 > λ1? 

But wait, another thought. The mean free path for the electron beam's electrons compared to the gas molecules. Even though the cross-section might be smaller for electrons, the speed of the electrons is much higher. Could the relative speed affect the mean free path?

Wait, the mean free path formula I mentioned earlier assumes that the targets (gas molecules) are stationary. If the incident particles (electrons) are moving much faster than the gas molecules (which have thermal velocities at room temperature, maybe on the order of hundreds of meters per second), then the relative speed is approximately the electron speed. So in that case, the mean free path would be calculated using the electron velocity as v, and the collision rate is nσv. Wait, no, the mean free path is the average distance between collisions, which would be λ = v * τ, where τ is the average time between collisions. τ is 1/(nσv_rel), so λ = v/(nσv_rel). 

Wait, if the electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules, then the relative velocity v_rel is approximately v_electron, since the gas molecules' velocity is negligible in comparison. So then, collision rate would be proportional to n * σ * v_electron. Thus, τ = 1/(nσv_electron), and λ_electron = v_electron * τ = 1/(nσ). Which is the same formula as the original mean free path. Hmm. So then λ1 (gas molecules) is approximately 1/(nσ1) and λ2 is 1/(nσ2). 

Therefore, even if cross-section σ2 is different from σ1, since number density n is the same (since pressure and temperature are the same?), wait, why is the number density the same? Wait, the sample compartment's pressure is maintained at the same level by the vacuum pumps. But actually, when Mike initiated the electron beam, the pressure is still the same (as given in the problem: even though he turned on the electron beam, the pressure is still <10^-9 Torr, and temperature is the same). So number density n is same. Therefore, why would the mean free path differ? Because it's a different cross-section. So it's about the cross-section of the electrons vs. the cross-section of the gas molecules hitting each other.

Assuming the gas molecules are much larger in cross-sectional area: So σ1 (gas-gas collision) is bigger than σ2 (electron-gas collision), so λ2 = 1/(nσ2) would be larger than λ1 = 1/(nσ1). Therefore, the mean free path of electrons should be longer than the gas molecules' own mean free path. Hence, λ2 > λ1.

Wait, but perhaps I have a misapprehension here. Does mean free path depend on the size of the moving particle? If particles A and B are moving with different sizes, then yes. So, in this case, the gas molecules have a certain cross-section when colliding with each other. In the case of electrons (which are much smaller) moving through the same gas, the cross-sectional area is determined by the electron's interaction cross-section, which could be smaller or perhaps different depending on other factors.

But another angle: electrons may interact with the gas molecules via inelastic scattering, such as ionization, or elastic scattering. For example, the mean free path equations for electrons in gases can depend on different factors. There's scaling with energy as well.

Wait, but the key here is that the mean free path as per electron scattering would be different than that calculated for gas molecules colliding. Since electrons are much smaller and faster, their mean free path would generally be longer. Hence, λ2 should be greater than λ1. So Mike observed that when the electron beam is on, the mean free path is λ2, which is longer than λ1.

Alternatively, maybe the opposite. For instance, if gas molecules are really sparse, but perhaps the size of the gas molecules is gigantic compared to the electrons. Wait, λ1 being the mean free path for the gas molecules: with ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is very long, since collisions are rare. Then in the electron's case, when n is the same, but the cross-section for electron scattering is perhaps even lower, making λ2 longer? Then that would agree with λ2 > λ1.

But another approach: Let's recall some typical values. In an ultra-high vacuum (like 10^-9 Torr), the mean free path for gas molecules is on the order of kilometers. So λ1 is very large. For electrons traveling through this same vacuum, their mean free path would be determined by electron-gas molecule collisions. Given that electrons are much smaller and the cross-section is lower, the mean free path would be even longer. Wait, but if that's the case, they would have longer λ2. But given that under UHV, even λ1 is already so long, getting an even longer λ2 for the electrons would mean even fewer collisions. However, how does that reconcile with the scenario?

Wait the problem states that Mike observed that the mean free path based on electron scattering was λ2, even though the sample compartment conditions remained the same. That implies that after initiating the electron beam, there is a different mean free path. But in reality, even if n is the same, when we calculate λ for electrons, using cross-sections for electrons vs gas molecules, which are smaller; indeed, quantum mechanically, the cross-section for electrons scattering off gas molecules may be quite small, making λ2 much longer than λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps Mike wasn't actually calculating the mean free path for gas molecules when the electron beam was initiated but instead was calculating the electron mean free path only when the beam was active. So the question hinges on whether the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1) under their own collisions is being compared with the mean free path of the electrons (λ2) scattering off the gas molecules.

Therefore, under the same pressure (same n), but with a much smaller cross-section (since electrons are small, maybe σ_electron << σ_gas_molecule), the λ2 would be much longer. Hence λ2 >> λ1.

But wait, is the collision cross-section for electrons and gas molecules actually smaller? For example, for a nitrogen molecule, the diameter is on the order of 0.3 nm. The cross-section for collision would be about π*(0.3 nm)^2 ≈ 0.28 nm². On the other hand, what is the cross-section for electrons scattering off nitrogen molecules? If the electron's de Broglie wavelength is on the order of the size of the molecule, then the cross-section might be similar. Alternatively, if the electron is very fast (as in a 1000 kV accelerating voltage), the wavelength is very small, leading to a small cross-section. 

The de Broglie wavelength λ = h / p. For an electron accelerated through 1000 kV, the kinetic energy is 1 MeV (since eV is the electron charge times voltage). But at such high energies, relativistic effects are significant. The rest mass of an electron is 0.511 MeV/c². So at 1 MeV kinetic energy, the total energy is about 1.511 MeV. Using relativistic momentum relations: the momentum p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m_e c)^2 ). But perhaps for estimation, they were non-relativistic. Wait, but 1000 kV is a huge voltage. Let's note. If an electron is accelerated through 1000 kV, it's energy is 1 MeV. But that's about twice the rest mass energy. So definitely relativistic.

Let me compute the de Broglie wavelength. Let's see, total energy E = gamma m c². Kinetic energy K = E - m c² = (gamma - 1)m c². Given that K = 1 MeV, and m c² = 0.511 MeV. Therefore, gamma = (1 + 1)/0.511 ≈ 1.956. Then gamma is roughly 2.

Total energy E = gamma m c² ≈ 2*0.511 MeV ≈ 1.022 MeV.

Momentum p = sqrt(gamma^2 - 1) * m c. Let's compute sqrt( (gamma^2 - 1) )*m c. Gamma is approximately 1.956. So gamma^2 ≈ 3.827. So sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) = sqrt(2.827) ≈ 1.681. Therefore, p ≈ 1.681 * m c. m c for an electron is ~0.511 MeV/c /c * c = 0.511 MeV/c. So p ≈ 1.681 * 0.511 ≈ 0.859 MeV/c.

De Broglie wavelength λ = h / p. Planck's constant h is approx 4.135667696 × 10^-15 eVs. Wait, wavelengths and energies: converting this properly. Let's see.

Alternatively, using relativistic electron wavelength:

λ = hc / sqrt( (K + m c² )² - (m c² )² )

Calculating K=1MeV:

λ = (1240 eV nm) / sqrt( (1 MeV + 0.511 MeV)^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) 

Calculating denominator:

sqrt( (1.511)^2 -0.511^2 ) = sqrt( 2.283 -0.261 ) = sqrt(2.022) ≈1.422 MeV 

So λ = (1240 eV nm) / 1.422e6 eV ≈ 8.719e-4 nm ≈ 0.00087 nm, which is much smaller than typical atomic sizes (which are ~0.1 nm). Therefore, the de Broglie wavelength of the 1 MeV electrons is about 0.0008 nm, which is tiny. 

The gas molecules in the chamber (like nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) have sizes on the order of 0.3 nm. Therefore, the cross-section for scattering, considering the size of the electron's wavelength vs the molecule, would be roughly on the order of the molecule's cross-section (since the wavelength is much smaller), but quantum effects would come into play.

But even if we take the classical approximation, the collision cross-section for electrons with a molecule is roughly similar to the geometric cross-section: πr² ≈ π*(0.3 nm /2)^2 ≈ 0.07 nm². That's σ ≈ 7e-20 m². 

Compare that with σ for gas-gas collisions (same order, maybe higher due to actual intermolecular distances during collision?), but perhaps similar. Wait, gas molecules colliding is more complicated, because they move and have kinetic energy, so maybe the cross-section there is similar. So actually, if σ2 (electron-molecule) is similar to σ1 (molecule-molecule), then λ2 ≈ λ1. But since σ2 could be smaller due to electron size.... Wait but molecule is much larger, so maybe the cross-sectional area is dominated by the molecule's size. Therefore, in which case, σ1 (molecule-molecule collision) would be larger because you have two molecules each with diameter d: the cross-section is πd² where d is the collision diameter. For electron-molecule collision, the cross-section is approximately πd² (since the molecule is much larger and the electron is a point). Therefore, actually, σ1 ≈ πd² (assuming the molecule-molecule cross-section) and σ2 ≈ πd² as well? Therefore, λ1 and λ2 should be approximately the same.

But wait, that can’t be. Because actually, mean free path for a particle A moving through particles B is inversely proportional to the number density of B times the cross-sectional area. If the electron is much smaller, and the cross-section is determined by the larger molecule size. Then yes, but since we're considering the cross-section as the effective target area, σ for electron-molecule would be similar to molecule-molecule's σ. So are the mean free paths similar?

But in high energy accelerators, for example, electrons can pass through gas with relatively small interaction probability. But maybe in our case, given high vacuum, the electron mean free path is extremely large. But how does it compare to the gas molecules mean free path.

Wait, in the scenario, given that Mike designed the vacuum pumps to minimize gas molecules, thus he measures the gas mean free path as λ1, which is in ultra-high vacuum, already very long. But the electron may have a longer or shorter mean free path. Let me re-examine.

If λ1 is the gas molecules colliding with each other (mean free path λ1) under high vacuum. Then, when the electron beam is turned on, the electrons are moving through the same gas. The electron's mean free path λ2 (distance between collisions with gas molecules) depends on the number density of gas and the cross-section of the electron-gas interaction.

Assuming the electron interaction cross-section σ is smaller than the gas-gas interaction cross-section σ1 (since electrons are point particles and maybe the cross-section for interaction is smaller, or if cross-section is similar, but perhaps depending on speed or not.)

Wait, but in gas kinetic theory, the cross-section is generally considered independent of speed, treating particles as hard spheres. But in reality, cross-sections for interactions can depend on energy, especially in quantum mechanics. For example, Rutherford scattering cross-section is different.

But the problem states nothing about how cross-sections compare, except that the environment is same. Therefore, knowledge-based answer is required.

I think what needs to be considered here is that the mean free path for electrons (λ2) is determined not by the electron-electron collisions (which are negligible here) but by electron-gas molecule collisions. Since the number density and temperature (hence maybe speed of gas molecules isn't critical, but electrons are moving much faster so their speed dominates in collision frequency.

However, though cross-section for electron colliding with gas molecules is σ and since for a beam of electrons, the rate of collisions is governed by nσv_e, where v_e is the electron velocity. So the mean free path (λ) for the electrons would be v_e/(nσv_t), where v_t is thermal velocity of the gas, if that is significant. But for electrons accelerated at 1000 kV, their speed is relativistic (as calculated: ~0.859 MeV/c was momentum, so velocity would be like sqrt( (pc)^2 / (m^2 c^2 + p^2 c^2 )) )m m.

But perhaps since the gas molecules' velocity is negligible compared to the electrons, then the relative velocity is approximated by the electron velocity. Thus, collision rate is nσv_e per second, so the average time between collisions τ is 1/(nσv_e). Then mean free path λ2 = v_e * τ = 1/(nσ). 

But for gas molecules, their mean free path leading to λ1 is 1/(sqrt(2) π d^2 n). So if σ for electrons one substitution for collision cross-section. If the cross-section for electron-molecule interaction is σ, and σ's comparison to the gas molecule gas-molecule cross-section ≈ πd².

Alternatively, if we ignore wall effects and just consider between molecules, the problem states that after the vacuum is created, Mike calculated λ1 based on compartment volume, pressure etc. Probably using the gas theory formula λ = (k_B T)/(sqrt(2) π d^2 p )

But the formulation for the electron's mean free path is different? Because in the case of electrons, they are projectiles moving through a gas, the formula would be different. 

Alternatively, taking the formula from electron scattering: for a beam of particles (electrons) moving through a medium (gas), the mean free path is λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of the gas and σ is the cross-section.

For gas molecules, their mean free path (λ1) is 1/(sqrt(2) π d^2 n), where sqrt(2) accounts for the relative motion between molecules. 

So these are different expressions. Unless σ for electrons is equal to sqrt(2) π d^2, but in any case, even just going by values, since the cross-section for electrons may be different.

But in reality, the cross-section for electrons moving through a gas is usually made up of various interaction processes (scattering, ionization, etc.), but for the sake of this problem, it's comparing λ1 (gas molecules’ mean free path) and λ2 (electron mean free path in the gas).

Since the question states that the vacuum is ultra-high (pressure <10^-9 Torr), so n is low. However, Mike observed λ2 (based on electron scattering) is different. Since accelerating voltage is high (1000 kV), the electrons are moving very fast, but that affects the collision rate perhaps. However, in the mean free path formula λ = v * τ, the τ (time between collisions) is 1/(n σ v). So substituting, λ = 1/(n σ). So even though the electron is moving very fast, the mean free path is 1/(n σ). But in contrast, the gas molecules' mean free path is different because two molecules are moving, leading to square root of 2 factors ?

Hence, key parameters: λ1 = 1/(sqrt(2) π d^2 n), and λ2 = 1/(n σ). 

But for λ2, σ is the cross-section for electron scattering. If certain σ happens to equal sqrt(2) π d^2 then λ2=λ1/sqrt(2). But in general, without specific values, we can argue whether σ is bigger or smaller.

But for electron-molecule cross-section, assuming similar to gas-gas cross-section (thinking that maybe the cross-sectional area is same, but not including the sqrt(2) factor because for a moving electron and stationary gas molecule (approximate), compared to both gas molecules moving.

Wait, when dealing with a beam of particles (like electrons) moving through a gas, the cross-section is considered as the same whether or not the target particles are moving. That may not be exactly correct. Because when calculating the scattering probability, yes, average velocity has impact. But in mean free path for beam particles through stationary targets, the formula is λ = 1/(nσ) because the relative speed is same as beam speed. In contrast, for gas molecules colliding with each other, they all move, hence the vrms is multiplied by sqrt(2) in the calculation.

Therefore, perhaps electron’s λ2 is determined without the sqrt(2) factor. If σ is same (nearly same, assuming σ electron-gas is similar to gas-gas), then the mean free path of electrons would be λ2 = (sqrt(2)/σ) ) / (n σ) Wait, not quite.

Wait, perhaps better to look at the actual formulas. For molecules in gas in thermal motion, but assuming Maxwell-Boltzmann, mean free path is λ1 = (k_B T)/(sqrt(2) π d^2 p ). For electron beam of velocity v through a stationary gas at density n, number density n, cross-section σ: λ2 = v * τ, where τ is average time between collisions. The collision rate is n σ v electrons per second (since the gas molecules are considered stationary). Hence, since τ =1/( n σ v ), then λ2= v * 1/(n σ v ) = 1/(n sigma) for electrons. So for electrons, that's λ2 =1/(n σ_e). For gas molecules, λ1 =1/(sqrt(2) n σ_g ), where σ_g is the cross-section of gas molecules (pi d^2 sqrt(2) due to relative speed))?

Wait, probably here λ1 =1/(sqrt(2) π d^2 n). So the difference between λ1 and λ2 enters because:

For gas molecules colliding: λ1 =1/( sqrt(2) π d² n )

Electron colliding with gas (assuming cross-section same as gas molecules’ collision cross-section (i.e., sigma_e = π d² )) ： λ2 =1/(n π d² )

Thus in this case, λ1 and λ2’s ratio would be sqrt(2), so λ2 =lambda1 / sqrt(2). So, the mean free path for electron would be shorter than lambda1. But sigma for electron may be even smaller because, for electrons, even if the cross-section is pi d², but adjusted by other factors.

Hmm. Is the collision cross-section sigma_e for electron and gas molecules the same as sigma_g_as (gas-gas cross-section)?

Alternatively，if Mike calculated the mean free path of gas molecules via

lambda1 = k_B T/(sqrt(2) pi d^2 p)

and when considering the electron beam,

lambda2 = 1/(n sigma_e ), and n = p/(k_B T)

Therefore n sigma_e = p/(k_B T) * sigma_e. Therefore, lambda2 =1/( (p/(k_B T)) sigma_e )

Hence,

lambda2 =k_B T / (p sigma_e )

For lambda1 =k_B T/(sqrt(2) pi d^2 p)

Suppose sigma_e is equal to pi d^2.

Then lambda2 = k_B T/(p pi d^2 )

So λ1 = lambda2 / sqrt(2 )

Therefore, lambda2 = lambda1 * sqrt(2)

Therefore, lambda2 is longer by sqrt(2) for this setup. So λ2 > lambda1.

But that's assuming the cross-section for electron is same as cross-section for gas molecule when deducing lambda1, though in reality when gas molecules collide, their cross-section has an encountered "diameter", which is accounted for in the factor. Hence, lambda2 for electrons would be longer. So given this, if collision cross-section same as gas-gas cross-section (without the sqrt(2)), then lambda2 would be longer than lambda1 by sqrt(2). If sigma_e is actually *smaller*, which perhaps more likely the case, then lambda2 would be even longer.

Conversely, if the cross-section for electrons is the same as that between gas molecules (with sqrt(2)), but not, it depends.

Alternatively, the important point is: when the electron beam is on, the mean free path is the electron traveling through the gas. The cross-section for electron-molecule collision is tiny compared to molecule-molecule collision. Hence, sigma_e << sigma_g (which is pi d^2 ), therefore, with lambda2 =1/(n sigma_e ). If sigma_e << sigma_g, then λ2 >> lambda1.

But, the common knowledge: For example, in a gas with a mean free path of λ1 for gas molecules, another particle (like an electron) with all else equal but different cross-section would have lambda dependent on that cross-section. Low cross-section (electrons) means higher lambda.

Therefore, Mike found that when firing the electron beam, the mean free path based on electron scattering is longer than the gas molecules’ original mean free path, so λ2 > λ1. Thus, the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1.

Okay, so I need to figure out the relationship between λ1 and λ2 here. Let me start by recalling what the mean free path means. The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. In the first scenario, Mike calculated λ1 for gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum.

Wait, if the electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules, then the relative velocity v_rel is approximately v_electron, since the gas molecules' velocity is negligible in comparison. So then, collision rate would be proportional to n * σ * v_electron. Thus, τ = 1/(nσv_electron), and λ_electron = v_electron * τ = 1/(nσ). Which is the same formula as the original mean free path. Hmm. So then λ1 (gas molecules) is approximately 1/(nσ1) and λ2 is 1/(nσ2). 

Therefore, even if cross-section σ2 is different from σ1, since number density n is the same (since pressure and temperature are the same?), wait, why is the number density the same? Wait, the sample compartment's pressure is maintained at the same level by the vacuum pumps. But actually, when Mike initiated the electron beam, the pressure is still the same (as given in the problem: even though he turned on the electron beam, the pressure is still <10^-9 Torr, and temperature is the same).

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2 in this scenario. Let me consider what mean free path represents: the average distance a particle travels between collisions. In the first case, Mike calculated λ1 for gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum, representing the average distance gas molecules travel before colliding with each other.

When the electron beam is activated, λ2 represents a different mean free path. Since the temperature remains constant, the gas molecules' thermal motion is unchanged. The key insight is that λ2 must represent the mean free path of electrons moving through the gas, not the gas molecules themselves. The electrons, accelerated at 1000 kV, are moving at high velocities through the gas medium.

The formula for mean free path is λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. For gas molecules colliding with each other, the cross-section σ1 would be approximately πd², where d is the molecular diameter. However, for electrons interacting with gas molecules, the cross-section σ2 would be different.

Electrons, being point particles, interact with gas molecules through mechanisms like Coulomb interactions. The cross-sectional area for electron-gas molecule collisions is likely smaller than for gas-gas collisions due to the size difference. Since λ is inversely proportional to nσ, if σ2 is smaller than σ1, then λ2 would be larger than λ1.

I should consider whether the electrons' higher speed affects the mean free path. For fast-moving electrons, the relative velocity between electrons and gas molecules is essentially the electron velocity, since gas molecules move much slower. The collision rate would be proportional to n × σ × v_electron, giving τ = 1/(nσv_electron) as the average time between collisions. The mean free path would then be λ_electron = v_electron × τ = 1/(nσ), which returns us to the original formula.

Since the pressure and temperature remain constant when the electron beam is turned on (still <10^-9 Torr), the number density n is the same in both scenarios. Therefore, the difference in mean free paths must arise from the different cross-sections: σ1 for gas-gas collisions versus σ2 for electron-gas collisions.

Given that gas molecules are much larger than electrons, σ1 (gas-gas) would be larger than σ2 (electron-gas). Consequently, λ2 = 1/(nσ2) would be larger than λ1 = 1/(nσ1). This indicates that electrons should have a longer mean free path than gas molecules in the same environment, suggesting that λ2 > λ1.

Electrons may also interact with gas molecules through various scattering mechanisms, including inelastic processes like ionization or elastic scattering, which could influence the mean free path calculations differently than simple gas-gas collisions.

Alright, I need to determine the connection between λ1 and λ2 in this case. I'll begin by reviewing what mean free path signifies. It represents the average distance a particle travels before colliding. In the initial scenario, Mike calculated λ1 for gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum, which reflects the regular mean free path where gas molecules collide with each other.

However, when the electron beam is activated, the mean free path λ2 changes. But why is that? The problem specifies that the temperature stays constant, so the thermal motion of gas molecules shouldn't change. It seems the mean free path here pertains to the electrons rather than the gas molecules, and this is crucial. Initially, λ1 describes the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with one another. When the electron beam is introduced, λ2 would be the mean free path for electrons traversing the gas. Since electrons are significantly smaller and move at much higher speeds (due to the 1000 kV accelerating voltage), their mean free path is different.

Considering the formula for mean free path, for a particle moving through a gas, mean free path depends on gas molecule number density, particle cross-sectional area, and perhaps the relative speed. The formula is λ = 1/(nσ), where n represents number density and σ the collision cross-section.

For gas molecules colliding among themselves, the cross-section relies on the size of the gas molecules (maybe diameter d), comparable to one another, so σ1 = πd². But for electrons, which are essentially point particles, the cross-section for scattering with gas molecules (σ2) might differ. Although electrons interact with gas molecules through Coulomb interactions or other forces, the cross-section might vary in size depending on interaction probability.

Given the size difference, electrons are much smaller than gas molecules, making the electron-gas molecule collision cross-section smaller than gas-gas collisions. Thus, since λ is inversely proportional to nσ, if σ2 is smaller than σ1, λ2 becomes larger than λ1. Consequently, the mean free path λ2 for electrons exceeds that of gas molecules λ1, meaning λ2 > λ1.

But another thought occurs: considering the electron beam's mean free path relative to gas molecules. Despite the electrons' potentially smaller cross-section, their much higher speed might influence their mean free path.

Wait, the earlier formula for mean free path assumes stationary gas molecule targets. If incident particles like electrons travel significantly faster than gas molecules (which have room-temperature thermal velocities, possibly in the hundreds of meters per second), the relative speed nearly equals the electron speed. The mean free path calculation then uses the electron velocity v, with collision rate being nσv. No, the mean free path is the average distance between collisions, expressed as λ = v * τ, where τ denotes the average time between collisions. τ equals 1/(nσv_rel), so λ = v/(nσv_rel).

When electrons travel much faster than gas molecules, the relative velocity v_rel approximates v_electron, meaning the gas molecule velocity is negligible by comparison. Thus, the collision rate correlates to n * σ * v_electron. Hence, τ = 1/(nσv_electron), and λ_electron = v_electron * τ = 1/(nσ). It matches the original mean free path formula. So λ1 (for gas molecules) amounts to 1/(nσ1) and λ2 to 1/(nσ2).

Consequently, even if σ2 diverges from σ1, the number density n is constant, derived from the same pressure and temperature conditions. But acknowledging this, the sample compartment pressure is regulated by vacuum pumps. Even when the electron beam starts, the pressure remains <10^-9 Torr with temperature constant. Therefore, n stays unchanged. Why then does the mean free path vary? It's due to the varying cross-section: electron versus gas molecule cross-section.

Assuming gas molecules possess larger cross-sectional areas: Thus, σ1 (gas-gas collision) surpasses σ2 (electron-gas collision), so λ2 = 1/(nσ2) outstrips λ1 = 1/(nσ1). Thus, the electron mean free path exceeds that of the gas molecules, confirming λ2 > λ1.

But I might have a misconception—a mean free path's dependence on the moving particle size. If particles A and B differ in size while moving, yes, size matters. Gas molecules possess a certain cross-section for self-collision. In the case of smaller electrons moving through the same gas, the cross-sectional interaction area hinges on the electron cross-section, different or smaller potentially due to other variables.

Another perspective: electrons may experience inelastic scattering (e.g., ionization) or elastic scattering with gas molecules. For electrons in gases, mean free path equations might involve additional aspects, like energy scaling.

But the core is that mean free path, per electron scattering, differs from calculation for gas molecules colliding. Since electrons are...

The mean free path λ₂ of electrons in the ultra-high vacuum environment is **greater than** the mean free path λ₁ of the gas molecules colliding with each other (λ₂ > λ₁). Here's the breakdown:

1. **Mean Free Path Basics**:  
   The mean free path (\(\lambda\)) is inversely proportional to the number density (\(n\)) and the collision cross-section (\(\sigma\)):  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{n\sigma}.
   \]  
   For gas molecules colliding with each other (\(\lambda_1\)), the cross-section \(\sigma_1\) reflects their physical size. For electrons scattering with gas molecules (\(\lambda_2\)), the cross-section \(\sigma_2\) is much smaller because electrons (point charges) interact via weaker electromagnetic forces rather than direct physical collisions.

2. **Impact of Cross-Section Difference**:  
   Since \(\sigma_2 \ll \sigma_1\), even at the same number density (\(n\)) and temperature, the mean free path of electrons (\(\lambda_2\)) becomes significantly longer than that of gas molecules (\(\lambda_1\)).

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The electron beam experiences fewer collisions due to the reduced interaction cross-section, leading to \(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1\).

**Answer:**  
\(\boxed{\lambda_2 > \lambda_1}\)
