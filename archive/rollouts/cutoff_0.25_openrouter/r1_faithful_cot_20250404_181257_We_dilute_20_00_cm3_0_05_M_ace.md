First, we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. The new concentration of acetic acid is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Initial moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02000 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}
\]
\[
\text{New volume} = 0.04000 \, \text{L}
\]
\[
\text{New concentration} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04000 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles, so we need 0.001 moles of NaOH. Given the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01000 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

For 25% titration, 25% of 10.00 cm³ (2.50 cm³) of NaOH is added:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.00250 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, forming 0.00025 moles of acetate. The remaining acetic acid is 0.00075 moles. The total volume is 42.50 cm³:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075 \, \text{moles}}{0.04250 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025 \, \text{moles}}{0.04250 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right)
\]
\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.7328
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 4.7328 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) \approx 4.7328 - 0.4771 \approx 4.26
\]

At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate (0.001 moles in 50.00 cm³):

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.05000 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}
\]

The Kb of acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Using the quadratic formula to solve for [OH⁻]:

\[
\text{pOH} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{p}K_b - \log C \right)
\]
\[
\text{p}K_b = -\log(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \approx 9.267
\]
\[
\text{pOH} = \frac{1}{2} (9.267 - (-1.69897)) \approx 5.483
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 5.483 \approx 8.52
\]

Final answers:
\[
\text{pH at 25% titration: } \boxed{4.26}
\]
\[
\text{pH at equivalence point: } \boxed{8.52}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. They want the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Alright, let's start by understanding what's happening here.

First, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we're diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So that means the total volume after dilution is 40.00 cm³. Since we're adding equal parts acid and water, the concentration should be halved, right? Because concentration is moles over volume, and the volume doubles. Let me check that:

Original moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02000 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04000 L, so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04000 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct. So the acetic acid concentration after dilution is 0.025 M.

Now, we're titrating this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about the 25% titration first. 25% titration means that we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. So we need to figure out how much NaOH that is.

First, what's the equivalence point? The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 moles. So we need 0.001 moles of NaOH to reach equivalence. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³. So the equivalence point volume of NaOH is 10.00 cm³.

At 25% titration, we add 25% of 10.00 cm³, which is 2.50 cm³ of NaOH. So in the solution at 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming acetate ions. This should create a buffer solution, right? Because we'll have a mixture of the weak acid (acetic acid) and its conjugate base (acetate). So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Let me confirm the moles. The moles of NaOH added at 25% are 0.1 M * 0.00250 L = 0.00025 moles. Since acetic acid reacts with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio, this will neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, forming 0.00025 moles of acetate. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate (conjugate base) are 0.00025.

The total volume of the solution now is 40.00 cm³ + 2.50 cm³ = 42.50 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So the concentrations would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.00588 M

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

First, find pKa. Given Ka is 1.85x10^-5.

pKa = -log(1.85x10^-5). Let's compute this.

log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672, so pKa ≈ 5 - 0.2672 = 4.7328? Wait, no, because log(1.85x10^-5) = log(1.85) + log(10^-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328, so pKa = 4.7328.

Wait, hold on: pKa = -log(Ka). Since Ka is 1.85e-5, then:

-log(1.85e-5) ≈?

Calculate log(1.85) first. Since log(1.8) is 0.2553, log(1.85) is a bit higher. Let me be precise. log(1.85) = 0.2672 (as per my calculator). Therefore, pKa is approximately 4.7328. Let me confirm this with exact calculation:

Using calculator: 1.85e-5. Take ln(1.85)=0.615185, so log(1.85)=ln(1.85)/ln(10)=0.615185/2.302585≈0.2672. So yes, pKa=4.7328.

So then, applying Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = 4.7328 + log(0.00588 / 0.01765)

Compute that ratio: 0.00588 / 0.01765 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771

Therefore, pH ≈ 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557 ≈ 4.26

Wait, let me check that calculation. So 0.3333 is 1/3. log(1/3) = log(1) - log(3) = 0 - 0.4771 ≈ -0.4771. So yeah. Then, 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557. So about 4.26.

But let me check again the concentrations. Wait, after adding 2.50 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 40 + 2.50 = 42.50 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

The moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001.

Moles reacted: 0.00025 (because 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025). So remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025.

Thus, [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333, so log(0.3333) is indeed -0.4771. Then pH ≈ 4.7328 -0.4771 = 4.2557 ≈ 4.26. Okay, that seems correct. So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.

Now the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001. The volume of NaOH needed, as previously determined, is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³. So the total volume at equivalence is 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.

At equivalence, the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. So all 0.001 moles of CH3COOH become 0.001 moles of CH3COO^- in 0.05000 L. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.050 = 0.02 M.

But acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so in solution, it will hydrolyze to produce OH^- ions. The pH at equivalence should be basic. To find this, we can calculate the Kb of acetate and then determine the pH.

First, Kb = Kw / Ka. At 25°C, Kw = 1.0e-14. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then, the acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M. Let me call that C = 0.02. The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-]

Assume that x is the concentration of OH^- produced. Then,

Kb = x² / (C - x) ≈ x² / C, since Kb is very small and x is negligible compared to C.

Thus, x² = Kb * C = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11

Therefore, x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.0396e-5

Thus, [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M

Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.983

pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 4.983 = 9.017 ≈ 9.02

Wait, but I want to check if the assumption that x is small compared to C is valid. Since C is 0.02 M and x is ~1e-5, which is indeed much smaller, so the approximation holds. So pH ≈9.02.

But let's do it more accurately. Let's not make the assumption.

Set up Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10

So x² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 - x)

Since x is small, 0.02 - x ≈0.02, but let's solve the quadratic.

x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0

Using quadratic formula: x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2

Compute discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.922e-19

4*1*1.081e-11=4.324e-11

sqrt(2.922e-19 +4.324e-11) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) because 2.922e-19 is negligible.

So sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6

Wait, that can't be. Wait, wait 4.324e-11 is 4.324 x 10^-11, the square root of that is about 6.576 x 10^-6. So:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2

We take the positive root:

x = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈6.576e-6 /2 =3.288e-6

Wait, but that gives x ≈3.29e-6, but previous approximation gave x ≈1.04e-5. What's going on?

Wait, no, what is here. Wait maybe I messed up the Kb expression. Wait no, Kb is 5.405e-10, C is 0.02. Let's check again. If without approximation:

Equation: x² = 5.405e-10*(0.02 - x)

Trying to solve:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0

So discriminant is (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11

= 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11≈4.324e-11

So sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6

Thus x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6)/2≈(6.576e-6)/2=3.288e-6

Wait, but that gives x=3.288e-6. Then [OH^-]=3.288e-6, pOH= -log(3.288e-6)= about 5.48, so pH=14-5.48=8.52. That contradicts the earlier approximation. Wait, so which is correct?

Wait, maybe my setup was wrong. Wait we said that the acetate ion concentration was 0.02 M, and the Kb is 5.405e-10, but the equation is correct.

Wait, why are there two different solutions here? Because if x is 3.288e-6, then verifying:

x squared is (3.288e-6)^2≈1.081e-11

And Kb*(0.02 -x) =5.405e-10*(0.02 -3.288e-6)=5.405e-10*(0.019996712)= approx 5.405e-10*0.02 =1.081e-11, same as x squared. So indeed, the exact solution gives x≈3.288e-6, which is inconsistent with the first approximation which assumed x is negligible.

But now this is confusing because when we made the first approximation, assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, we got x= sqrt(Kb*C)=sqrt(5.405e-10*0.02)= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.0396e-5. But when solving using quadratic, we get x≈3.288e-6. These are different results. Wait, why?

Wait what's the correct calculation here. Let's actually calculate Kb*C.

Wait, 5.405e-10 * 0.02=1.081e-11

Thus, if we do x= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5, but when solved via quadratic, x was 3.288e-6, which would be sqrt(Kb*(C -x))? Wait, but if we use x=1.04e-5, then C-x=0.02-1.04e-5≈0.01999, which is very close to 0.02, and the initial estimate would be close to 1.04e-5, right?

Wait, maybe there was a calculation error in solving the quadratic equation. Let me recompute:

Let me write down the quadratic equation carefully:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0

So here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D= b² -4ac= (5.405e-10)^2 -4*1*(-1.081e-11)

Wait, previously I had a sign error here. Since c is -1.081e-11, 4ac=4*1*(-1.081e-11)=-4.324e-11, so D= b² -4ac = (2.921e-19) - (-4.324e-11) = 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11. That's correct.

Thus sqrt(D)=6.576e-6

Thus x= [ -b ± sqrt(D) ]/(2a). Since b is 5.405e-10,

x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ) /2≈approx 6.576e-6 /2≈3.288e-6

But if this is the case, then [OH^-]=3.288e-6 M, which leads to pOH=5.48 and pH=8.52.

But when we approximated x≈sqrt(Kb*C)=sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M, leading to pOH=4.98 and pH=9.02.

Which one is correct? There seems to be a discrepancy here. Wait, to check. Let's substitute back.

Take the approximate x=1.04e-5, plug into equation:

x² = (1.04e-5)^2=1.08e-10

RHS: Kb*(C -x)=5.405e-10*(0.02 -1.04e-5)=5.405e-10*(0.0199896)=5.405e-10 *0.0199896 ≈1.080e-11

But left-hand side (x²)=1.08e-10, which is ten times the RHS. Therefore, this approximation is invalid, so I must have made an error in calculation.

Wait, so the approximation x ≈ sqrt(Kb*C) is obviously conflicted here, because when substituting back, it doesn't hold. Therefore, need to solve it via quadratic. Wait, but the quadratic solution gives a different result.

Wait, this must mean that my previous steps were wrong.

Wait, I must have messed up in terms of Kb for the acetate ion.

Wait, wait, no, but Kb is Kw / Ka.

Given Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5. Kw=1e-14. So Kb is indeed 1e-14 / 1.85e-5≈5.405e-10, that's correct.

Then why in the world is the exact solution contradicting the approximation here?

Wait, perhaps because the assumption x is negligible is not applicable. Wait, but according to the accurate solution, x is 3.288e-6, but C is 0.02, which is 2e-2. So 3.288e-6 /0.02 =0.0001644, so about 0.016%, which is really small. So the approximation should hold.

Wait, but earlier when I computed using x≈sqrt(Kb*C), x=1.04e-5, but when computed exactly via quadratic, x=3.288e-6, which is three times smaller.

Wait, how is that possible? Maybe the calculation is wrong.

Wait, we have:

The correct solution for x is [OH^-]=3.288e-6.

Then then [OH^-]=3.288e-6→ pOH=5.48→pH=14-5.48=8.52.

But when I calculate Kb*C=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. So x indeed in approximation should be sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. However, solving the quadratic equation, gives x=3.288e-6. So we have a contradiction. Hence, perhaps me made miscalculation in the quadratic.

Wait:

Quadratic equation is:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Let me compute x = [ -5.405e-10 + sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 ) ] /2

Wait, discriminant D is actually (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11≈4.324e-11, same as before.

Therefore sqrt(D)=6.576e-6, hence equation becomes (-5.405e-10 +6.576e-6)/(2). So the 6.576e-6 is way bigger than 5.405e-10, so approximately 6.576e-6 /2≈3.288e-6. So x≈3.288e-6.

But plugging this into x^2:

(3.288e-6)^2≈1.081e-11, which equals Kb*(C –x)=5.405e-10*(0.02 –3.288e-6)=5.405e-10*(0.019996712)=5.405e-10*approx 0.02=1.081e-11. Therefore, the equations works. So there is a mistake in the prior consideration.

Wait, but here we have x=3.288e-6, leading to [OH^-]=3.288e-6 gives pOH= -log(3.288e-6)=5.48, pH=14 –5.48=8.52. But according to the approximate formula, if x= sqrt(Kb*C)=1.04e-5, which would lead to pOH≈5 –log(1.04e-5)= 5?

Wait, no:

pH + pOH=14.

If [OH^-]=1.04e-5, pOH= -log(1.04e-5)= -log(1.04) + (-log(1e-5))= approx 0.017 +5=4.983, so pH=14 –4.983=9.017.

But wait, solving the quadratic does give x=3.288e-6, which gives a lower OH^- concentration. So which is correct?

Wait, it looks like the earlier mistake was in the set-up of the equation.

Let’s re-express:

The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O -> CH3COOH + OH^-

Equilibrium concentrations:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 –x

[CH3COOH] = x

[OH^-] =x

Then the Kb expression is:

Kb= [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = x²/(0.02 –x)

Which gives x² + Kb*x – Kb*0.02 =0, which is x² +5.405e-10 x –5.405e-10*0.02= x² +5.405e-10 x –1.081e-11=0, which is what we had before. Solving that gives x=3.288e-6. However, this contradicts the fact that if x was small, then x² = Kb*C = 1.081e-11, leading to x=1.04e-5.

But wait in reality, suppose x is 1.04e-5. Then, Kb would be x²/(0.02 –x)= (1.04e-5)^2/(0.02 -1.04e-5)≈(1.081e-10)/0.0199896≈5.407e-9, which is ten times higher than expected Kb of 5.405e-10. So that can’t be.

Therefore, there must be an error in the initial problem setup or interpretation. Wait, no. Perhaps I made a mistake in basic arithmetic, or mistook dilution. Maybe.

Wait, recall that after reaching equivalence point, we have a solution of sodium acetate.

But the concentration of acetate is not 0.02 M? Let's confirm:

Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001.

After diluting to 40 cm³, same 0.001 moles. But when titrated with 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH are 0.1 *0.01=0.001. Therefore, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + H2O + Na+

So at equivalence, we’ve added 0.001 moles NaOH, neutralizing all 0.001 moles acetic acid to form 0.001 moles acetate. The total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L. Therefore, the concentration is correct 0.001 /0.05=0.02 M. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps Kb is different?

Wait, original Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa=4.7328, Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5≈5.405e-10.

Yes. Then there's something wrong here. Because using exact equation gives a different result, but conclusion is conflicting. Maybe there's an error in computation when solving the quadratic.

Wait computing it again, the quadratic equation is:

x² +5.405e-10 x –1.081e-11=0

Which, using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2

Now compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2=2.921e-19

4*1*1.081e-11=4.324e-11

Therefore, discriminant is≈4.324e-11, so sq root of that is≈6.576e-6

Then x=( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ) / 2≈(6.575e-6)/2≈3.288e-6.

Hence x≈3.288e-6

Thus [OH^-]=3.288e-6→pOH≈5.48→pH=8.52.

But why when I calculated initial approximation, I get x=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 which resulted in pOH=4.98.

What is the issue here? Or maybe that my assumption here is wrong.

Wait, maybe I did Kb * C?

Wait initial [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. The correct calculation would involve solving with this.

Wait maybe we need to consult whether the exact solution is required here, or the approximation holds.

Alternatively, compute it as a hydrolysis problem but using more precise methods. But if the proper calculation gives [OH^-]=3.288e-6, which is M.

Thus pOH=5.48 and pH=8.52.

But initial approximation overestimates x mistakenly.

Alternatively, considering not Kb but for some reason missing on the concentration? Maybe some other error?

Wait, maybe while discussing the problem of qualitative assessment, the solution assumes that the concentration is higher. Hmm.

But why is that, given the original calculation.

Wait perhaps I have a mistake here. Wait, to check quickly: if we consider that after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M. But initial mole is 0.001 in 0.04 L. Add 0.01 L of NaOH so total volume is 0.05 L. How much moles of acetate?0.001, just as I originally had. So calculation stands.

Alternatively, given the very low Kb of acetate, maybe it’s more correct of a factor here. For example, if Kb is 5.4e-10, then even 0.02 M acetate would generate low OH^-.

Wait, maybe the original assumption's result is more accurate. Let me check a example value. If Kb is very small, the concentration of OH- can be found by x= sqrt(Kb × C), which would x= sqrt(5.405e-10 ×0.02)= sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But in that case, if I use that for x, and plug back into BCA:

Initial acetate:0.02

Hydrolysis: forms x amount of OH- and x amount of CH3COOH.

Thus,

Kb= [x][x]/[0.02 -x]=x²/(0.02 -x) =1.08e-10/(0.02 -1.04e-5)≈1.08e-10 /0.0199896≈5.41e-9 which is WAY bigger than given Kb=5.405e-10.

Thus, the approximate relation x= sqrt(Kb*C) would only be valid if x is indeed << C. But when using this value here, RHS gives Kb close to 5.4e-9 instead of 5.4e-10. Which means the approximation cannot be done here.

Wait, even though x is 1.04e-5, compared to concentration 0.02 M (2e-2 M), which is 1.04e-5 /0.02=0.00052, so 0.052%. Which is less than 5%, so normally, the approximation is valid. So why when I plug into the exact equation, I get Kb≈5.4e-9, which is 10 times larger than original Kb.

Obviously, we have a mistake in the start.

Wait, we realized that initial calculation gave a contradiction. Thus, solving the quadratic gives an endogenous solution, x=3.288e-6, leading to OH-=3.288e-6 and [acetate]=0.02 -3.288e-6≈0.0199967≈0.02. Indeed, approximately, but calls for multiplying Kb times 0.02:

x² = Kb *0.02 → so x= sqrt(Kb *0.02). But according to this,

x= sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5. However, according to quadratic equation, we get different x.

I think the problem here is in inconsistent handling。

Let me search for example, if we think沃, in weak base calculations, how exactly do we do it.

The standard procedure is:

Kb = x² / (c - x). If c >> x, then approximate to Kb ≈x²/c →x≈sqrt(Kb*c). 

Which would be here x≈sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02)= 1.04e-5. So leads to [OH-]=1.04e-5.

But according to the quadratic equation solution, the true solution is x=3.288e-6. That suggests that sqrt(Kb*c) yielded a higher x than the actual solution.

Wait, this indicates that there is an error in calculating the quadratic solution.

Wait, unless my calculation for Kb is wrong. 

Wait, double-check Kb:.

Ka for acetic acid is given as 1.85e-5. Kw=1e-14. Kb=1e-14/(1.85e-5)=5.405e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate ion is 0.02 M. Correct.

So missing what?

Wait let's trigger a calculator here.

Compute for x≈3.288e-6:

The left-hand side x² is (3.288e-6)^2≈1.081e-11

Then right-hand side Kb*(c -x)=5.405e-10*(0.02 -3.288e-6)=5.405e-10*(0.019996712)=1.080e-11

Thus left-hand side equals right-hand side. So equation solved.

But now how come sqrt(Kb*c) gives a different value?

Because when x is supposed to be same as sqrt(Kb*c), but due to it being a quadraric potentially the approximation isn'thold due to The value's whether it's I guess, contrary to high school currículum’s...

But in reality, the correct solution here is given by the quadratic's so we have a pH of8.52.

But typical example problems that I remember for the acetate ion equivalwnce point would have pH around 8.7 or so. So getting 8.5 maybe is correct.

But now confusion in calculations.

Another approach:

Formula for equivalence point of weak acid with strong base:

First, calculate the concentration of the conjugate base: C = original moles / total volume.

Original moles=0.001. Total volume=0.05 L. C=0.02 M.

Sodium acetate’s pH.

Then the pH can be calculated using pH = 1/2 (pKw + pKa + log C)

Wait, another formula?

Wait, don't think so. Another way is to recognize that for weak base (acetate), the pH is calculated by:

pOH=1/2 (pKb - log C)

pH=14 - ½( pKb - log C )

pKb= -log(5.405e-10)=9.267

Thus,

pOH=½ (9.267 - log(0.02)).

log(0.02)= -1.69897.

Thus,

pOH=½ (9.267 - (-1.69897))=½(10.96597)=5.48299

→ pH=14 -5.48299=8.517, so ~8.52. Which matches the quadratic solution.

Yes. So indeed, the previous exact solution using quadratic gives correct results. Therefore, the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

It seems like using the formula pOH= (pKb - log C)/2 gives us directly the answer obtained via the quadratic. This formula matches.

Therefore, the initial assumption where we thought that - fagocitar sim sqrt(Kb*c), not sétá correct instead there is another formula. Therefore, it is important to select the correct approach.

Alternatively, learning now that for weak base calculation, the pH is better calculated after recognizing that a more precise formula can be used when hydrolyzing the conjugate base.

Thus, the best calculation for pH at equivalence is 8.52.

So summarizing:

At 25% titration: pH ≈4.26

At equivalence: pH≈8.52

However, sometimes there will be minor discrepancies due to rounding, but these values seem correct.

Thus, I think these are the two values expected.

**Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is \boxed{4.26} and at the equivalence point is \boxed{8.52}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So the question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. They want the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Alright, let's start by understanding what's happening here.

First, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we're diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So that means the total volume after dilution is 40.00 cm³. Since we're adding equal parts acid and water, the concentration should be halved, right? Because concentration is moles over volume, and the volume doubles. Let me check that:

Original moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02000 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the volume is 0.04000 L, so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04000 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct. So the acetic acid concentration after dilution is 0.025 M.

Now, we're titrating this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about the 25% titration first. 25% titration means that we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. So we need to figure out how much NaOH that is.

First, what's the equivalence point? The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 moles. So we need 0.001 moles of NaOH to reach equivalence. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³. So the equivalence point volume of NaOH is 10.00 cm³.

At 25% titration, we add 25% of 10.00 cm³, which is 2.50 cm³ of NaOH. So in the solution at 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming acetate ions. This should create a buffer solution, right? Because we'll have a mixture of the weak acid (acetic acid) and its conjugate base (acetate). So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Let me confirm the moles. The moles of NaOH added at 25% are 0.1 M * 0.00250 L = 0.00025 moles. Since acetic acid reacts with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio, this will neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, forming 0.00025 moles of acetate. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate (conjugate base) are 0.00025.

The total volume of the solution now is 40.00 cm³ + 2.50 cm³ = 42.50 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So the concentrations would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.00588 M

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

First, find pKa. Given Ka is 1.85x10^-5.

pKa = -log(1.85x10^-5). Let's compute this.

log(1.85) is approximately 0.2672, so pKa ≈ 5 - 0.2672 = 4.7328? Wait, no, because log(1.85x10^-5) = log(1.85) + log(10^-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328, so pKa = 4.7328.

Wait, hold on: pKa = -log(Ka). Since Ka is 1.85e-5, then:

-log(1.85e-5) ≈?

Calculate log(1.85) first. Since log(1.8) is 0.2553, log(1.85) is a bit higher. Let me be precise. log(1.85) = 0.2672 (as per my calculator). Therefore, pKa is approximately 4.7328. Let me confirm this with exact calculation:

Using calculator: 1.85e-5. Take ln(1.85)=0.615185, so log(1.85)=ln(1.85)/ln(10)=0.615185/2.302585≈0.2672. So yes, pKa=4.7328.

So then, applying Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = 4.7328 + log(0.00588 / 0.01765)

Compute that ratio: 0.00588 / 0.01765 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771

Therefore, pH ≈ 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557 ≈ 4.26

Wait, let me check that calculation. So 0.3333 is 1/3. log(1/3) = log(1) - log(3) = 0 - 0.4771 ≈ -0.4771. So yeah. Then, 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557. So about 4.26.

But let me check again the concentrations. Wait, after adding 2.50 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 40 + 2.50 = 42.50 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

The moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001.

Moles reacted: 0.00025 (because 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025). So remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025.

Thus, [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333, so log(0.3333) is indeed -0.4771. Then pH ≈ 4.7328 -0.4771 = 4.2557 ≈ 4.26. Okay, that seems correct. So the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.

Now the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added are equal to the initial moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001. The volume of NaOH needed, as previously determined, is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³. So the total volume at equivalence is 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.

At equivalence, the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. So all 0.001 moles of CH3COOH become 0.001 moles of CH3COO^- in 0.05000 L. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.050 = 0.02 M.

But acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so in solution, it will hydrolyze to produce OH^- ions. The pH at equivalence should be basic. To find this, we can calculate the Kb of acetate and then determine the pH.

First, Kb = Kw / Ka. At 25°C, Kw = 1.0e-14. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Then, the acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M. Let me call that C = 0.02. The hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So Kb = [CH

# Anthropic completion

I'll attempt to solve this problem methodically. We're dealing with a situation where acetic acid is diluted and titrated with NaOH, and we need to find the pH at both 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. This gives us a total volume of 40.00 cm³. The dilution halves the concentration because we've doubled the volume while keeping the same amount of acid. Let me verify this:

The original amount of acetic acid is 0.05 M × 0.02000 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, this is in 0.04000 L, so the new concentration becomes 0.001 ÷ 0.04000 = 0.025 M. This confirms that the acetic acid concentration is now 0.025 M.

For the titration with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to determine how much NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid (0.001 moles). Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume needed is 0.001 ÷ 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³.

At 25% titration, we've added 25% of the required NaOH, which is 2.50 cm³. This means 0.1 M × 0.00250 L = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have been added, neutralizing the same amount of acetic acid and producing 0.00025 moles of acetate ions. The remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

The total solution volume at this point is 40.00 cm³ + 2.50 cm³ = 42.50 cm³ (0.0425 L), giving concentrations of:
[CH₃COOH] = 0.00075 ÷ 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 M
[CH₃COO⁻] = 0.00025 ÷ 0.0425 ≈ 0.00588 M

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])), I first need pKa. Given Ka = 1.85×10⁻⁵, pKa = -log(1.85×10⁻⁵).

Computing this: log(1.85) = 0.2672, so pKa = 4.7328.

Applying Henderson-Hasselbalch:
pH = 4.7328 + log(0.00588 ÷ 0.01765)
The ratio is approximately 0.3333, so log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771
Therefore, pH ≈ 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557 ≈ 4.26

For the equivalence point, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been converted to acetate ions. The total volume is now 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ (0.05000 L), giving an acetate concentration of 0.001 ÷ 0.05000 = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is a weak base (conjugate of a weak acid), it hydrolyzes in water to produce OH⁻ ions. To find the pH, I need Kb for acetate:
Kb = Kw ÷ Ka = 1.0×10⁻¹⁴ ÷ 1.85×10⁻⁵ ≈ 5.405×10⁻¹⁰

For the hydrolysis reaction CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O ⇌ CH₃COOH + OH⁻

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let me reformulate the given text for you:

Sure, let me tackle this problem step by step. The question involves the dilution of acetic acid followed by its titration with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let's dive in and understand what's occurring.

Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is then diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. As the acid and water are mixed in equal volumes, the concentration is effectively halved since concentration is defined as moles over volume, and our volume has doubled. I’ll verify this:

Starting moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02000 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, with a total volume of 0.04000 L, the new concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04000 = 0.025 M. That's right. So, post-dilution, the acetic acid concentration stands at 0.025 M.

Now, we titrate this diluted solution using 0.1 M NaOH. Let's start by considering the 25% titration scenario. At 25% titration, we've introduced 25% of the NaOH required to reach the equivalence point. We first need to determine the quantity of NaOH necessary for this.

The equivalence point is where the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. After dilution, the moles of acetic acid remain 0.001. Thus, we require 0.001 moles of NaOH to reach equivalence. With NaOH at 0.1 M, the needed volume is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³. Therefore, the equivalence point volume of NaOH is 10.00 cm³.

At 25% titration, we add 25% of 10.00 cm³, equaling 2.50 cm³ of NaOH. Consequently, the solution at 25% titration has some acetic acid neutralized by NaOH, leading to acetate ion formation. This results in a buffer solution due to the coexistence of the weak acid (acetic acid) and its conjugate base (acetate), allowing us to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

To verify the moles, the moles of NaOH added at 25% are 0.1 M * 0.00250 L = 0.00025 moles. Given the 1:1 reaction ratio, this neutralizes 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, creating 0.00025 moles of acetate. Initially, we had 0.001 moles of acetic acid, leaving 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles remaining. The conjugate base (acetate) moles are 0.00025.

The existing solution volume now is 40.00 cm³ + 2.50 cm³ = 42.50 cm³, or 0.0425 L. Thus, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.00588 M

By applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Firstly, find pKa. Given Ka is 1.85x10^-5:

pKa = -log(1.85x10^-5).

Computing this, log(1.85) is about 0.2672, hence pKa ≈ 5 - 0.2672 = 4.7328. Just a moment—because log(1.85x10^-5) = log(1.85) + log(10^-5) = 0.2672 - 5 = -4.7328, we have pKa = 4.7328.

By calculating: -log(1.85e-5) ≈?

Check log(1.85). Given log(1.8) is 0.2553, log(1.85) is slightly higher. More precisely, log(1.85) = 0.2672 (checked on calculator). Thus pKa is around 4.7328. Validation with exact computation confirms: using calculator: 1.85e-5. Here ln(1.85)=0.615185, thus log(1.85)=ln(1.85)/ln(10)=0.615185/2.302585≈0.2672. Therefore, pKa=4.7328.

Applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = 4.7328 + log(0.00588 / 0.01765)

Computing ratio: 0.00588 / 0.01765 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771

Thus, pH ≈ 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557 ≈ 4.26

Double-checking the math: so 0.3333 equals 1/3. log(1/3) = log(1) - log(3) = 0 - 0.4771 ≈ -0.4771. Subsequently, 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557. Properly calculated, so the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.

Now for the equivalence point. At equivalence, all acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. Thus, the NaOH moles added equal the original acetic acid moles, which is 0.001. As determined, the NaOH volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³. The final volume at equivalence is 40.00 cm³ + 10.00 cm³ = 50.00 cm³ = 0.05000 L.

At equivalence, the acetic acid converts entirely to acetate ions. This alternation results in 0.001 moles of CH3COOH turning into 0.001 moles of CH3COO^- within 0.05000 L, giving an acetate concentration of 0.001 / 0.050 = 0.02 M.

Acetate, being the conjugate base of a weak acid, will dissociate in solution to yield OH^- ions, leading to a basic pH at equivalence. To deduce this, calculate acetate's Kb and then the pH.

First, Kb = Kw / Ka. Considering Kw = 1.0e-14 at 25°C: Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So approximately 8.52.\n\nWait, but let me be precise.\n\nCalculating pOH: log(3.29e-6) = log(3.29) + log(1e-6). log(3.29) ≈ 0.517, so log(3.29e-6) ≈ 0.517 - 6 = -5.483, so pOH = 5.483. pH = 14 -5.483 = 8.517 ≈ 8.52. That seems reasonable for the equivalence point of a weak acid and strong base titration.\n\nBut wait, was the assumption that x << C valid? Here, x ≈ 3.29e-6 and C = 0.02 = 2e-2. The ratio x/C is approximately 1.645e-4, which is much less than 5%. So the approximation is valid. So yes, pH ≈ 8.52.\n\nBut wait, to get more precise, maybe I should do the exact quadratic equation?\n\nThe Kb expression is:\n\nKb = x^2 / (C - x). With C = 0.02.\n\nSo the equation is x^2 = Kb*(C - x)\n\nx^2 + Kb x - Kb C = 0\n\nBut Kb is so small, 5.405e-10, so x is going to be sqrt(Kb*C) plus a tiny term. Using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² + 4*Kb*C)] / 2\n\nBut as Kb is << C, the sqrt(Kb² +4Kb*C) ≈ sqrt(4 Kb C) = 2*sqrt(Kb C)\n\nSo denominator 2. Therefore,\n\nx ≈ [ -Kb + 2*sqrt(Kb C) ] /2 ≈ sqrt(Kb C) - Kb/2. Since Kb is negligible, x≈sqrt(Kb C) as before. So the approximation is good. So no need to do the quadratic.\n\nHence, pH is about 8.52.\n\nBut let me check my calculation of Kb.\n\nKa of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. Therefore, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = let's calculate that accurately.\n\n1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is (1/1.85) *1e-9 = approximately 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.\n\nThen sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6. So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6, then pOH is 5.48 and pH is 8.52.\n\nAnother way is to calculate [OH^-]:\n\n[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C ) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = 3.288e-6. Take negative log: -log(3.288e-6) = 5.483. So pH is 14 -5.483 ≈ 8.517. So, 8.52.\n\nTherefore, the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.\n\nWait a second, let me think again. Could there be a mistake in this approach? Because when the acetate ion is present in solution, the solution is basic. So we calculate the hydroxide concentration from Kb. Then got 8.52 for pH. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, in some textbooks, they use different approximations. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the exact expression.\n\nBut given that the approximation is valid, okay.\n\nSo for the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use more precise calculations.\n\nBut I think this is acceptable.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nAt 25% titration: pH ≈ 4.26\n\nAt equivalence point: pH ≈ 8.52\n\nWait, but let me check if in the 25% titration, maybe there's a factor I overlooked.\n\nWhen we dilute the acetic acid, the concentration was halved to 0.025 M. But during titration, adding NaOH solution, the volume increases. So as the titration progresses, the total volume is increasing. We considered that in our calculation for the 25% point, where after adding 2.5 cm³, total volume is 42.50 cm³.\n\nWait, no. At 25% of the equivalence point, exactly. Wait, equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of NaOH. So 25% of the equivalent volume would be 2.5 cm³. That's right.\n\nSo, yes, all calculations are correct.\n\nWait, given that, I think that the answer would be pH 4.26 and 8.52.\n\nBut let me check calculation once again. Wait, when we diluted the acetic acid with water, the concentration is indeed 0.025 M, then the initial CH3COOH is 0.025 M.\n\nWhen titrated with 0.1M NaOH. Hence, we need moles of NaOH equal to moles of CH3COOH (0.001) to reach equivalence. So 10 cm³. Then 25% is 2.5 cm³, which introduces 0.00025 moles of OH-. This would convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-. Therefore, ratio calculation as done above.\n\nWait, yes, then subsequent buffer solution. Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Calculations for both concentrations after reaction. So the numbers check out. So that's correct.\n\nThus, the answer at 25% is pH approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, approximately 8.52.\n\nBut considering significant figures. The given data has 20.00 cm³ (4 sig figs), 0.05 M (1 or 2? 0.05 has two), 0.1 M (1 or 2?), and Ka is given as 1.85e-5 (three sig figs). So pH at 25% should be to two decimal places given the Ka has three. Similarly, 0.05 is maybe two? So perhaps the answers need two decimal places. Since when we calculated, we got 4.2557, which is approx 4.26, and 8.517 which is 8.52. So, both two decimal places. So final answers 4.26 and 8.52.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equivalence point requires more precise calculation. Wait, but I used Kb = 5.405e-10 but to three sig figs because Ka was given as three. Thus, Kb is calculated as 5.41e-10. Then sqrt(5.41e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.082e-11) = approx 3.29e-6. Then pOH is 5.483, pH is 8.517, which is 8.52. So 8.52.\n\nSo, the answers would be pH = 4.26 and pH = 8.52.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if the answer at equivalence can also be calculated by another method. Let's think.\n\nAt equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Then we need to calculate the pH of a 0.02 M sodium acetate solution.\n\nThe formula for the pH is: pH = 1/2 (pKw + pKa + log C) ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps let me recall. Wait for the hydrolysis of the conjugate base:\n\nFor a weak base (acetate ion), the concentration of OH- is sqrt(Kb * C). As we did before. Which leads to the same calculation.\n\nAlternatively, could we use pH = 7 + (pKa + log C)/2?\n\nWait, I think the formula varies based on the approach.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of pH:\n\nFor weak base, such as acetate:\n\nKb = [HB][OH^-] / [B^-]\n\nAssuming [OH^-] = [HB], and [B^-] ≈ C, so:\n\n[OH^-]^2 = Kb * C\n\n[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C)\n\nThen [OH^-] = sqrt( (1e-14 / 1.85e-5) * 0.02 )\n\nWhich is the same calculation as before. So identical result. So pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - (-log(sqrt( (1e-14 / 1.85e-5) * 0.02 )) )\n\nYes. So I think the result is consistent.\n\nSo to recap, final answers: at 25% titration pH ≈ 4.26, at equivalence pH≈8.52. So presented as \\boxed{4.26} and \\boxed{8.52}.\n\nBut wait, acetic acid's Ka is given as 1.85e-5. Let me use more precise value for pKa.\n\nCompute pKa more accurately: Ka = 1.85e-5. log(1.85) is (using exact calculation):\n\nlog(1.85):\n\nLog(1.8) = 0.2552725051\n\nLog(1.85) = Log(1.8) + log(1.05/1.0 + (1.85-1.8)/1.8)). But perhaps faster to just know 10^0.267 = ~1.85.\n\nLet me use calculator-like steps:\n\n1.85 is between 10^0.267 and 10^0.2672.\n\nBut exact calculation: ln(1.85) ≈ 0.61518564.\n\nTherefore, log(1.85) = ln(1.85)/ln(10) ≈ 0.61518564 / 2.302585093 ≈ 0.2672. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) = 4.7328.\n\nYes, so using more decimal places.\n\nSo if in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we use pKa = 4.7328 and log(0.3333) is actually log(1/3) = -0.477121255.\n\nThus, pH = 4.7328 - 0.47712 = 4.2557, which rounds to 4.26.\n\nFor the hydroxide concentration, let me check how exact.\n\nKb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Dilution of Acetic Acid:**
   - Original volume and molarity: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M CH₃COOH.
   - After dilution with 20.00 cm³ water, total volume = 40.00 cm³.
   - New concentration of CH₃COOH = (0.05 M × 0.02000 L) / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M.

2. **Moles of Acetic Acid:**
   - Initial moles = 0.001 mol (0.05 M × 0.02000 L).

3. **Equivalence Point Volume of NaOH:**
   - Moles of NaOH required = 0.001 mol.
   - Volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed: 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01000 L = 10.00 cm³.

4. **25% Titration (2.50 cm³ NaOH added):**
   - Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M × 0.00250 L = 0.00025 mol.
   - Remaining CH₃COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.
   - Formed CH₃COO⁻: 0.00025 mol.
   - Total volume: 40.00 + 2.50 = 42.50 cm³ = 0.0425 L.
   - Concentrations: [CH₃COOH] = 0.01765 M, [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.00588 M.
   - Using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([CH₃COO⁻]/[CH₃COOH]).
   - pKa = -log(1.85×10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.73. pH ≈ 4.73 + log(0.333) ≈ 4.26.

5. **Equivalence Point:**
   - All CH₃COOH converted to 0.001 mol CH₃COO⁻.
   - Total volume = 50.00 cm³, [CH₃COO⁻] = 0.02 M.
   - Kb = Kw / Ka = 1×10⁻¹⁴ / 1.85×10⁻⁵ ≈ 5.41×10⁻¹⁰.
   - [OH⁻] = √(Kb × [CH₃COO⁻]) = √(5.41×10⁻¹⁰ × 0.02) ≈ 3.29×10⁻⁶ M.
   - pOH = -log(3.29×10⁻⁶) ≈ 5.48. pH = 14 - 5.48 ≈ 8.52.

**Final Answers:**
- **At 25% Titration:** pH = \(\boxed{4.26}\)
- **At Equivalence Point:** pH = \(\boxed{8.52}\)

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] ≈ x^2 / (C - x)

Since Kb is so small (5.4e-10) and C is 0.02 which is much larger than x, we can approximate (C - x) ≈ C. So x^2 ≈ Kb * C

Thus, x = √(Kb * C) = √(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ √(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.0395e-5.5. Wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) is approx sqrt(1.081) * 1e-5.5 = ~1.04 * 3.16e-6? Wait, no. 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. 5.5 is halfway between 5 and 6. Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6 because 10^(-5.5) = 10^(0.5) * 10^-6 = sqrt(10) *1e-6 ≈ 3.16e-6. But multiplied by sqrt(1.081). So sqrt(1.081) ≈ 1.039. So x ≈ 1.039 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6. Check:

Calculate 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. sqrt(1.081e-11) is 3.29e-6. So x ≈ 3.29e-6. Then [OH^-] = 3.29e-6.

Thus, pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.483.

Therefore, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 - 5.483 = 8.517. So approximately 8.52.

Wait, but let me be precise.

Calculating pOH: log(3.29e-6) = log(3.29) + log(1e-6). log(3.29) ≈ 0.517, so log(3.29e-6) ≈ 0.517 - 6 = -5.483, so pOH = 5.483. pH = 14 -5.483 = 8.517 ≈ 8.52. That seems reasonable for the equivalence point of a weak acid and strong base titration.

But wait, was the assumption that x << C valid? Here, x ≈ 3.29e-6 and C = 0.02 = 2e-2. The ratio x/C is approximately 1.645e-4, which is much less than 5%. So the approximation is valid. So yes, pH ≈ 8.52.

But wait, to get more precise, maybe I should do the exact quadratic equation?

The Kb expression is:

Kb = x^2 / (C - x). With C = 0.02.

So the equation is x^2 = Kb*(C - x)

x^2 + Kb x - Kb C = 0

But Kb is so small, 5.405e-10, so x is going to be sqrt(Kb*C) plus a tiny term. Using quadratic formula:

x = [-Kb ± sqrt(Kb² + 4*Kb*C)] / 2

But as Kb is << C, the sqrt(Kb² +4Kb*C) ≈ sqrt(4 Kb C) = 2*sqrt(Kb C)

So denominator 2. Therefore,

x ≈ [ -Kb + 2*sqrt(Kb C) ] /2 ≈ sqrt(Kb C) - Kb/2. Since Kb is negligible, x≈sqrt(Kb C) as before. So the approximation is good. So no need to do the quadratic.

Hence, pH is about 8.52.

But let me check my calculation of Kb.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. Therefore, Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = let's calculate that accurately.

1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is (1/1.85) *1e-9 = approximately 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Then sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6. So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6, then pOH is 5.48 and pH is 8.52.

Another way is to calculate [OH^-]:

[OH^-] = sqrt( Kb * C ) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = 3.288e-6. Take negative log: -log(3.288e-6) = 5.483. So pH is 14 -5.483 ≈ 8.517. So, 8.52.

Therefore, the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

Wait a second, let me think again. Could there be a mistake in this approach? Because when the acetate ion is present in solution, the solution is basic. So we calculate the hydroxide concentration from Kb. Then got 8.52 for pH. That seems correct.

Alternatively, in some textbooks, they use different approximations. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the exact expression.

But given that the approximation is valid, okay.

So for the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise calculations.

But I think this is acceptable.

So summarizing:

At 25% titration: pH ≈ 4.26

At equivalence point: pH ≈ 8.52

Wait, but let me check if in the 25% titration, maybe there's a factor I overlooked.

When we dilute the acetic acid, the concentration was halved to 0.025 M. But during titration, adding NaOH solution, the volume increases. So as the titration progresses, the total volume is increasing. We considered that in our calculation for the 25% point, where after adding 2.5 cm³, total volume is 42.50 cm³.

Wait, no. At 25% of the equivalence point, exactly. Wait, equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of NaOH. So 25% of the equivalent volume would be 2.5 cm³. That's right.

So, yes, all calculations are correct.

Wait, given that, I think that the answer would be pH 4.26 and 8.52.

But let me check calculation once again. Wait, when we diluted the acetic acid with water, the concentration is indeed 0.025 M, then the initial CH3COOH is 0.025 M.

When titrated with 0.1M NaOH. Hence, we need moles of NaOH equal to moles of CH3COOH (0.001) to reach equivalence. So 10 cm³. Then 25% is 2.5 cm³, which introduces 0.00025 moles of OH-. This would convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-. Therefore, ratio calculation as done above.

Wait, yes, then subsequent buffer solution. Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Calculations for both concentrations after reaction. So the numbers check out. So that's correct.

Thus, the answer at 25% is pH approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, approximately 8.52.

But considering significant figures. The given data has 20.00 cm³ (4 sig figs), 0.05 M (1 or 2? 0.05 has two), 0.1 M (1 or 2?), and Ka is given as 1.85e-5 (three sig figs). So pH at 25% should be to two decimal places given the Ka has three. Similarly, 0.05 is maybe two? So perhaps the answers need two decimal places. Since when we calculated, we got 4.2557, which is approx 4.26, and 8.517 which is 8.52. So, both two decimal places. So final answers 4.26 and 8.52.

Alternatively, maybe the equivalence point requires more precise calculation. Wait, but I used Kb = 5.405e-10 but to three sig figs because Ka was given as three. Thus, Kb is calculated as 5.41e-10. Then sqrt(5.41e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.082e-11) = approx 3.29e-6. Then pOH is 5.483, pH is 8.517, which is 8.52. So 8.52.

So, the answers would be pH = 4.26 and pH = 8.52.

Alternatively, let me see if the answer at equivalence can also be calculated by another method. Let's think.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to sodium acetate. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Then we need to calculate the pH of a 0.02 M sodium acetate solution.

The formula for the pH is: pH = 1/2 (pKw + pKa + log C) ?

Wait, no, perhaps let me recall. Wait for the hydrolysis of the conjugate base:

For a weak base (acetate ion), the concentration of OH- is sqrt(Kb * C). As we did before. Which leads to the same calculation.

Alternatively, could we use pH = 7 + (pKa + log C)/2?

Wait, I think the formula varies based on the approach.

Alternatively, in terms of pH:

For weak base, such as acetate:

Kb = [HB][OH^-] / [B^-]

Assuming [OH^-] = [HB], and [B^-] ≈ C, so:

[OH^-]^2 = Kb * C

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C)

Then [OH^-] = sqrt( (1e-14 / 1.85e-5) * 0.02 )

Which is the same calculation as before. So identical result. So pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - (-log(sqrt( (1e-14 / 1.85e-5) * 0.02 )) )

Yes. So I think the result is consistent.

So to recap, final answers: at 25% titration pH ≈ 4.26, at equivalence pH≈8.52. So presented as \boxed{4.26} and \boxed{8.52}.

But wait, acetic acid's Ka is given as 1.85e-5. Let me use more precise value for pKa.

Compute pKa more accurately: Ka = 1.85e-5. log(1.85) is (using exact calculation):

log(1.85):

Log(1.8) = 0.2552725051

Log(1.85) = Log(1.8) + log(1.05/1.0 + (1.85-1.8)/1.8)). But perhaps faster to just know 10^0.267 = ~1.85.

Let me use calculator-like steps:

1.85 is between 10^0.267 and 10^0.2672.

But exact calculation: ln(1.85) ≈ 0.61518564.

Therefore, log(1.85) = ln(1.85)/ln(10) ≈ 0.61518564 / 2.302585093 ≈ 0.2672. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) = 4.7328.

Yes, so using more decimal places.

So if in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we use pKa = 4.7328 and log(0.3333) is actually log(1/3) = -0.477121255.

Thus, pH = 4.7328 - 0.47712 = 4.2557, which rounds to 4.26.

For the hydroxide concentration, let me check how exact.

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. Let's calculate this using better precision.

1 / 1.85 = 0.5405405405...

So Kb = 0.5405405405e-9 ≈ 5.405405405e-10.

Then, Kb * C = 5.405405405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081081081e-11.

Square root of that is sqrt(1.081081081e-11) = 3.288e-6.

So pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.483, pH = 8.517. Which is 8.52 when rounded to two decimal places.

I think that's consistent.

So I believe both answers are accurate.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To solve the problem, we start by considering the dilution of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. This results in a total volume of 40.00 cm³ and a new concentration of acetic acid:

\[
\text{New concentration} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}
\]

Next, we determine the amount of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04000 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}
\]

At equivalence, the volume of NaOH needed is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.010 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

For 25% titration, we use 2.50 cm³ of NaOH:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.00250 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol} - 0.00025 \, \text{mol} = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}
\]

The produced acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻) are 0.00025 mol. The total volume is 42.50 cm³, so concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075 \, \text{mol}}{0.04250 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025 \, \text{mol}}{0.04250 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation with \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.7328 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.7328 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) \approx 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557 \approx 4.26
\]

At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is converted to acetate ions (0.02 M). The hydrolysis of acetate is determined using \( \text{Kb} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \):

\[
\text{Kb} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02} \implies x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.039 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}
\]

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.039 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98 \implies \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02
\]

### Final Answer

At 25% titration, the pH is \boxed{4.26}, and at the equivalence point, the pH is \boxed{9.02}.

:
Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]
Assuming x is the concentration of OH⁻ produced:
At equilibrium, [CH3COOH] = x, [OH⁻] = x, [CH3COO⁻] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kb is small)
So, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405×10⁻¹⁰
Solving for x: x² = 0.02 × 5.405×10⁻¹⁰ = 1.081×10⁻¹¹
x = √(1.081×10⁻¹¹) ≈ 1.039×10⁻⁵ M

Then, pOH = -log(1.039×10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.98
pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02

I should check if the assumption x ≪ 0.02 holds, and 1.039×10⁻⁵ is indeed much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation is valid. So, pH at equivalence point is approximately 9.02.

**Final Answer**

At 25% titration, the pH is \boxed{4.26}, and at the equivalence point, the pH is \boxed{9.02}.

Thus, at equilibrium:\n\nKb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since Kb is very small (≈5.4e-10) and x << 0.02.\n\nTherefore, x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11. Ergo, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.040e-5.5. Wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ √(1.081) * 10^(-5.5). Since 10^(-5.5) is approx 3.16e-6. Considering sqrt(1.081)=approx 1.039, so x ≈ 1.039 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6. Let me compute that correctly:\n\nWait, actually 1.081e-11, square of that is ? Oops, let me correct. The square root of 1.081e-11 is equal to sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11). sqrt(1.081)=approx 1.039. sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5. Thus, 1.039 * 1e-5.5 ≈ 1.039 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6 M. Therefore, [OH^-] ≈3.28e-6 M.\n\nWait, coming back to the exact calculation:\n\nx^2 = Kb * C, so Kb=5.405e-10, C=0.02, so x^2=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11\n\nTherefore, x=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.5 ? Wait another approach: Using logarithmic computation.\n\nWait, better to compute sqrt(1.081e-11):\n\nLooking at 1.081e-11. We can write: sqrt(1.081e-11)=sqrt(1.081)*sqrt(1e-11)=approx 1.04 * 3.16e-6=>3.29e-6 M.\n\nThus, the [OH^-] is approximately 3.29e-6 M.\n\nWhich leads to pOH=-log(3.29e-6). Compute pOH:\n\nLog(3.29e-6)=log(3.29)+log(1e-6)=0.517 + (-6)= -5.483, so pOH=5.483. Then pH=14-5.483≈8.517, which is approximately 8.52.\n\nBut check this in more precise steps: Let’s recast using exact numbers.\n\nCalculating √(1.081e-11):\n\nUse calculator: sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081)*1e-5.5. Wait 1e-5.5 also equals √(1e-11)=1e-5.5. So sqrt(1.081e-11)=sqrt(1.081)*sqrt(1e-11)=1.0395 *3.1623e-6.\n\n1.0395 *3.1623 ≈3.2886e-6. So [OH-]=3.2886e-6 M.\n\nThen pOH=-log(3.2886e-6). Taking logs:\n\nlog(3.2886e-6)=log(3.2886)+(-6)=0.517 -6= -5.483, so pOH=5.483, hence pH=14 - 5.483=8.517≈8.52.\n\nAlternatively, compute rigorously using precise tools. Alternatively, we can use a more accurate approximation for OH-:\n\nThe formula for [OH-]=√(Kb*C), valid when Kb << C. Since here, Kb=5.4e-10, and C=0.02=2e-2, Hence Kb is indeed much lower than C, so the approximation holds. Then:\n\n[OH−]=√(5.405e-10×0.02) as above. Let me use precise values here:\n\n5.405e-10 *0.02= 1.081e-11. Take square root: sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 3.288e-6... So approx 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH is calculated as:\n\n−log10(3.288e-6)=5−log10(3.288)=5−0.516= If log(3)=0.4771, log(3.288)=log(3*1.096)=log(3)+log(1.096)=0.4771 +0.04= 0.5171. Hence pOH≈5−0.5171=4.4829 (Wait, no. Wait, 3.288e-6 is between 1e-6 and 1e-5. Therefore, the -log(3.288e-6) is 5.483. Wait... If [OH-]=3.288e-6, then pOH= -log(3.288e-6).  Move decimal point from 3.288e-6 to 3.288e-6=3.288*10^-6, so the logarithm is log(3.288) + (-6) ≈0.517 + (-6)= -5.483, so pOH=5.483. Thus pH=14 -5.483=8.517. So, 8.517 for pH at equivalence. So approximately 8.52. So rounding to two decimal places: 8.52.\n\nFor such problems, they might prefer using activity coefficients but given the solutions are probably ideal here, these approximations would suffice.\n\nAlternatively, to check one more time, suppose we use exact values.\n\nThe solution wouldn't be pure acetate; a tiny amount would react with water. The reaction proceeds with a K_b of approximately 5.4e-10. Thus if C=0.02 for acetate:\n\nK_b=x^2/(0.02 – x). If we can’t assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, solve the quadratic equation. However, 5.4e-10 is so small that x would be very small. x= sqrt(5.4e-10*0.02)=sqrt(1.08e-11)=approx 3.28e-6, which is negligible compared to 0.02. Thus, the approximation holds and x stays at ~3.28e-6. Hence pOH≈5.48, pH≈8.52.\n\nTherefore, the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.\n\nTo recap:\n\nAt 25% titration, pH is around 4.26.\n\nAt equivalence, pH is around 8.52.\n\nBut perhaps the computations can be made a bit tighter. For instance, the exact Henderson-Hasselbalch equation ratio:\n\n[CH3COO^-]/[CH3COOH] = (0.00025/0.0425) / (0.00075/0.0425) = 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3. Log(1/3)= -0.4771. Therefore, pH=4.7328 -0.4771=4.2557. To two decimal places, 4.26.\n\nThen, equivalence-point pH again:\n\nsqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt( (1e-14 /1.85e-5) *0.02 ). Calculating exact numbers once more, to check:\n\n1e-14 /1.85e-5=5.405e-10\n\nYes. Then Kb * C=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. The sqrt gives us approx 3.288e-6. This yields [OH^-]=3.288e-6, and pH=8.517, which rounds to 8.517 ≈8.52.\n\nGiven the use of logarithmic values, perhaps more precise calculation of pKa could affect.\n\nBut suppose we use exact pKa of acetic acid.\n\nBut most textbooks give acetic acid's pKa as ~4.76. Wait, given that the problem states Ka=1.85e-5. Wait, the actual pKa from that is log(1.85e-5). I computed 4.7328. But if I use a calculator: 1.85e-5→Take log: approximately, let's take the exact value.\n\nCompute log(1.85e-5):\n\nLet’s encode 1.85 ×10^-5. Taking logarithm:\n\nlog(1.85) = 0.2672 (verified). Therefore log(1.85e-5)=0.2672 -5= -4.7328. Thus, pKa=4.7328.\n\nThus, not exactly 4.74, as commonly known, but 4.73. Which, if used, would translate accurately.\n\nTaking 4.7328 instead of even the more common textbook value of 4.76 is okay here because the given Ka is 1.85e-5. So we must adhere to the given value.\n\nTherefore, pH at 25% titration is around 4.2557, which is 4.26, and equivalence point pH is 8.52.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nAt 25% titration: pH = 4.26\n\nAt equivalence point: pH = 8.52\n\nBoth values to two decimal places.\n\nBut wait, another check for equivalence. Maybe my assumption that the solution is dominated by acetate holds, but is there another factor?\n\nNo, since acetic acid is a weak acid (with a Ka of 1.85e-5) thus sodium acetate would have a Kb=Kw/Ka=1e-14/1.85e-5≈5.405e-10.\n\nSo sodium acetate in water (a weak base) will have pH via Kb. The calculation of the pH at equivalence point is okay as we are doing.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could use the ICE table:\n\nConsider acetate in water.\n\nInitial:\n\nCH3COO^-: 0.02 M\n\nCH3COOH: 0\n\nOH^-: 0\n\nChange:\n\nCH3COO^-: -x\n\nCH3COOH: +x\n\nOH^-: +x\n\nEquilibrium:\n\n[CH3COO^-]=0.02 -x≈0.02 (since x is negligible as proved)\n\n[CH3COOH]=x\n\n[OH^-]=x\n\nKb=(x *x ) /0.02=5.405e-10. So as before, x=sqrt(1.081e-11≈3.288e-6). Thus, same as before. Hence pH=8.52.\n\nSo the conclusion still holds.\n\nTherefore, these results should be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe pH at 25% titration is \\boxed{4.26} and at the equivalence point is \\boxed{8.52}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743816110, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3134, prompt_tokens=1525, total_tokens=4659, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Initially, we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a solution with a concentration of 0.025 M acetic acid. The moles of acetic acid after dilution remain 0.001 moles.

### At 25% Titration:
- **Volume of NaOH added**: 25% of the equivalence point volume (10.00 cm³) is 2.50 cm³.
- **Moles of NaOH added**: \(0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.00250 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}\).
- **Remaining moles of acetic acid**: \(0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}\).
- **Moles of acetate ion formed**: \(0.00025 \, \text{mol}\).

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right)
\]
- \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.7328\)
- Ratio \(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.00025}{0.00075} = \frac{1}{3}\)
- \(\log\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -0.4771\)

\[
\text{pH} = 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557 \approx 4.26
\]

### At the Equivalence Point:
- **Moles of NaOH added**: 0.001 moles (equivalence point).
- **Volume of NaOH added**: 10.00 cm³.
- **Total volume**: 50.00 cm³ (0.05000 L).
- **Concentration of acetate ion**: \(\frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.05000 \, \text{L}} = 0.02 \, \text{M}\).

Using the \(K_b\) for acetate:
\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}
\]
- \( [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \times C} = \sqrt{5.405 \times 10^{-10} \times 0.02} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\)
- \(\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483\)
- \(\text{pH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52\)

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is \boxed{4.26} and at the equivalence point is \boxed{8.52}.

Given the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, the acetate hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced. Thus, at equilibrium:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since Kb is very small (≈5.4e-10) and x << 0.02.

Therefore, x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 ≈ 1.081e-11. Ergo, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.040e-5.5. Wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ √(1.081) * 10^(-5.5). Since 10^(-5.5) is approx 3.16e-6. Considering sqrt(1.081)=approx 1.039, so x ≈ 1.039 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6. Let me compute that correctly:

Wait, actually 1.081e-11, square of that is ? Oops, let me correct. The square root of 1.081e-11 is equal to sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11). sqrt(1.081)=approx 1.039. sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5. Thus, 1.039 * 1e-5.5 ≈ 1.039 * 3.16e-6 ≈ 3.28e-6 M. Therefore, [OH^-] ≈3.28e-6 M.

Wait, coming back to the exact calculation:

x^2 = Kb * C, so Kb=5.405e-10, C=0.02, so x^2=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11

Therefore, x=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.5 ? Wait another approach: Using logarithmic computation.

Wait, better to compute sqrt(1.081e-11):

Looking at 1.081e-11. We can write: sqrt(1.081e-11)=sqrt(1.081)*sqrt(1e-11)=approx 1.04 * 3.16e-6=>3.29e-6 M.

Thus, the [OH^-] is approximately 3.29e-6 M.

Which leads to pOH=-log(3.29e-6). Compute pOH:

Log(3.29e-6)=log(3.29)+log(1e-6)=0.517 + (-6)= -5.483, so pOH=5.483. Then pH=14-5.483≈8.517, which is approximately 8.52.

But check this in more precise steps: Let’s recast using exact numbers.

Calculating √(1.081e-11):

Use calculator: sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081)*1e-5.5. Wait 1e-5.5 also equals √(1e-11)=1e-5.5. So sqrt(1.081e-11)=sqrt(1.081)*sqrt(1e-11)=1.0395 *3.1623e-6.

1.0395 *3.1623 ≈3.2886e-6. So [OH-]=3.2886e-6 M.

Then pOH=-log(3.2886e-6). Taking logs:

log(3.2886e-6)=log(3.2886)+(-6)=0.517 -6= -5.483, so pOH=5.483, hence pH=14 - 5.483=8.517≈8.52.

Alternatively, compute rigorously using precise tools. Alternatively, we can use a more accurate approximation for OH-:

The formula for [OH-]=√(Kb*C), valid when Kb << C. Since here, Kb=5.4e-10, and C=0.02=2e-2, Hence Kb is indeed much lower than C, so the approximation holds. Then:

[OH−]=√(5.405e-10×0.02) as above. Let me use precise values here:

5.405e-10 *0.02= 1.081e-11. Take square root: sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 3.288e-6... So approx 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH is calculated as:

−log10(3.288e-6)=5−log10(3.288)=5−0.516= If log(3)=0.4771, log(3.288)=log(3*1.096)=log(3)+log(1.096)=0.4771 +0.04= 0.5171. Hence pOH≈5−0.5171=4.4829 (Wait, no. Wait, 3.288e-6 is between 1e-6 and 1e-5. Therefore, the -log(3.288e-6) is 5.483. Wait... If [OH-]=3.288e-6, then pOH= -log(3.288e-6).  Move decimal point from 3.288e-6 to 3.288e-6=3.288*10^-6, so the logarithm is log(3.288) + (-6) ≈0.517 + (-6)= -5.483, so pOH=5.483. Thus pH=14 -5.483=8.517. So, 8.517 for pH at equivalence. So approximately 8.52. So rounding to two decimal places: 8.52.

For such problems, they might prefer using activity coefficients but given the solutions are probably ideal here, these approximations would suffice.

Alternatively, to check one more time, suppose we use exact values.

The solution wouldn't be pure acetate; a tiny amount would react with water. The reaction proceeds with a K_b of approximately 5.4e-10. Thus if C=0.02 for acetate:

K_b=x^2/(0.02 – x). If we can’t assume x is negligible compared to 0.02, solve the quadratic equation. However, 5.4e-10 is so small that x would be very small. x= sqrt(5.4e-10*0.02)=sqrt(1.08e-11)=approx 3.28e-6, which is negligible compared to 0.02. Thus, the approximation holds and x stays at ~3.28e-6. Hence pOH≈5.48, pH≈8.52.

Therefore, the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52.

To recap:

At 25% titration, pH is around 4.26.

At equivalence, pH is around 8.52.

But perhaps the computations can be made a bit tighter. For instance, the exact Henderson-Hasselbalch equation ratio:

[CH3COO^-]/[CH3COOH] = (0.00025/0.0425) / (0.00075/0.0425) = 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3. Log(1/3)= -0.4771. Therefore, pH=4.7328 -0.4771=4.2557. To two decimal places, 4.26.

Then, equivalence-point pH again:

sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt( (1e-14 /1.85e-5) *0.02 ). Calculating exact numbers once more, to check:

1e-14 /1.85e-5=5.405e-10

Yes. Then Kb * C=5.405e-10 *0.02=1.081e-11. The sqrt gives us approx 3.288e-6. This yields [OH^-]=3.288e-6, and pH=8.517, which rounds to 8.517 ≈8.52.

Given the use of logarithmic values, perhaps more precise calculation of pKa could affect.

But suppose we use exact pKa of acetic acid.

But most textbooks give acetic acid's pKa as ~4.76. Wait, given that the problem states Ka=1.85e-5. Wait, the actual pKa from that is log(1.85e-5). I computed 4.7328. But if I use a calculator: 1.85e-5→Take log: approximately, let's take the exact value.

Compute log(1.85e-5):

Let’s encode 1.85 ×10^-5. Taking logarithm:

log(1.85) = 0.2672 (verified). Therefore log(1.85e-5)=0.2672 -5= -4.7328. Thus, pKa=4.7328.

Thus, not exactly 4.74, as commonly known, but 4.73. Which, if used, would translate accurately.

Taking 4.7328 instead of even the more common textbook value of 4.76 is okay here because the given Ka is 1.85e-5. So we must adhere to the given value.

Therefore, pH at 25% titration is around 4.2557, which is 4.26, and equivalence point pH is 8.52.

Therefore, the answers are:

At 25% titration: pH = 4.26

At equivalence point: pH = 8.52

Both values to two decimal places.

But wait, another check for equivalence. Maybe my assumption that the solution is dominated by acetate holds, but is there another factor?

No, since acetic acid is a weak acid (with a Ka of 1.85e-5) thus sodium acetate would have a Kb=Kw/Ka=1e-14/1.85e-5≈5.405e-10.

So sodium acetate in water (a weak base) will have pH via Kb. The calculation of the pH at equivalence point is okay as we are doing.

Alternatively, another approach could use the ICE table:

Consider acetate in water.

Initial:

CH3COO^-: 0.02 M

CH3COOH: 0

OH^-: 0

Change:

CH3COO^-: -x

CH3COOH: +x

OH^-: +x

Equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-]=0.02 -x≈0.02 (since x is negligible as proved)

[CH3COOH]=x

[OH^-]=x

Kb=(x *x ) /0.02=5.405e-10. So as before, x=sqrt(1.081e-11≈3.288e-6). Thus, same as before. Hence pH=8.52.

So the conclusion still holds.

Therefore, these results should be correct.

**Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is \boxed{4.26} and at the equivalence point is \boxed{8.52}.
