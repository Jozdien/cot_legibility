To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we need to calculate its lifetime and velocity, then combine these values using relativistic equations.

1. **Lifetime Calculation**:
   The lifetime \( \tau \) is given by the uncertainty principle:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
   \]
   where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \text{ GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma_X = 320 \text{ MeV} = 0.32 \text{ GeV} \). Substituting these values:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \text{ GeV·s}}{0.32 \text{ GeV}} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \text{ s}
   \]

2. **Velocity Calculation**:
   The velocity \( \beta \) is found using the relativistic relation between energy, momentum, and mass:
   \[
   E^2 = p^2 + m^2
   \]
   Given \( E_X = 8 \text{ GeV} \) and \( m_X = 1.2 \text{ GeV} \), the momentum \( p \) is:
   \[
   p = \sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \text{ GeV}
   \]
   The velocity \( \beta \) is:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{p}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875
   \]

3. **Lorentz Factor (γ) Calculation**:
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
   \]

4. **Mean Decay Distance Calculation**:
   The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:
   \[
   L = \beta \gamma c \tau
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   L = 0.98875 \times 6.6667 \times 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \text{ s}
   \]
   Calculating step-by-step:
   \[
   c \tau = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \text{ s} \approx 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \text{ m}
   \]
   \[
   \beta \gamma = 0.98875 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.59
   \]
   \[
   L \approx 6.59 \times 6.1706 \times 10^{-16} \text{ m} \approx 4.07 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}
   \]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}.

Okay, so I need to find the mean decay distance of this meson resonance X. Let me start by recalling what I know about particle decays. The mean decay distance, or the average distance a particle travels before decaying, probably has something to do with its lifetime and its velocity. Right, the formula should be something like the product of the speed times the lifetime, right? So if I can find the lifetime and the velocity, I can multiply them to get the mean decay distance.

Alright, first things first. The lifetime. I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the width of a particle's resonance (Γ) to its mean lifetime (τ) through the equation Γ = ħ / τ. Since Γ is given as 320 MeV, I need to convert that into units where we can relate it to time. But wait, ħ is in units of GeV·s when converting from natural units. So let me recall the value of ħ in those terms. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So then, τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense.

Let me jot that down. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Then τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Simplifying that, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. So the lifetime τ is roughly 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hold on, that seems extremely short, but maybe that's correct for a resonance. Resonances typically have very short lifetimes because they decay via the strong interaction, right? So yeah, this must be in the right ballpark.

Okay, next I need to find the velocity of the meson X. The production energy is given as 8 GeV, and its mass is 1.2 GeV. Wait, but energy here might be the total energy, including rest mass. To find the velocity, I should relate the total energy, mass, and momentum. Let's recall that E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. But since we are dealing with natural units (where c=1), this simplifies to E² = p² + m². So the energy E is 8 GeV, the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So, solving for momentum p: p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV.

Calculating that: 8 squared is 64, and 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56, then square root of 62.56. Let me compute that. sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV. So the momentum p ≈ 7.91 GeV. Since in natural units, momentum p is in GeV/c but c=1, so just GeV.

But wait, velocity. How to get the velocity from this? Let's remember that in natural units, velocity β = p/E. Because β = v/c, and since in units where c=1, β = v. Then from relativity, the momentum p = γ m v, and E = γ m c², so dividing p by E gives v/(c²). But if c=1, p/E = v. So yes, β = p/E. Given p is 7.91 GeV and E is 8 GeV, β ≈ 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. So the velocity is approximately 0.98875 times the speed of light.

So if the velocity is 0.98875c, then in standard units, to get the velocity in m/s, it's 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. But actually, maybe we can use it in terms of c, because when calculating the mean path length, we can write it as βγcτ. Wait, let me think. The mean decay length is typically given by βγcτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Hmm, so maybe I made a step too fast earlier. Let me confirm the correct formula.

Wait, the mean proper lifetime is τ. But due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. Then the mean decay distance L is velocity multiplied by the lab frame lifetime. So L = v * γτ. Since v = βc, and γ = E/m_X, if E is the total energy.

Let me check that: γ is E/mc², since in natural units E = gamma m c². So since E is 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, then γ = E / m_X = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666...

So gamma is ~6.666... Then, the mean decay length is beta * gamma * c * tau. Let's calculate this step by step.

We have gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

We already calculated beta = p / E = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. Alternatively, beta can be computed from gamma as sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let's check:

1/γ = 1.2 /8 = 0.15, so gamma squared is (6.6667)^2≈44.444. So 1/γ² ≈ 0.0225, so sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.9775)≈0.9887, which matches the previous value. So beta=0.9887 approx.

So now, gamma*beta is ≈6.6667 *0.9887≈6.59. Then multiply by c*tau. What is tau?

Tau we said is ~2.056875e-24 seconds. So then c is 3e8 m/s. So calculating gamma*beta* c *tau:

First, multiply gamma*beta ≈6.59.

Then c*tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 6.17e-16 meters.

Wait, that seems extremely small. But then, multiplying by gamma beta ≈6.59, total L ≈ 6.59 *6.17e-16 m ≈4.07e-15 meters, which is 4.07 femtometers. That seems insanely small.

But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation here. Wait, 3e8 m/s * 2.05e-24 s = 3e8 *2.05e-24 = 6.15e-16 meters. Then times gamma beta ~6.59 gives 6.15e-16 *6.59≈4.05e-15 m, yes.

But 4 femtometers is about the size of a nucleus. But particles usually travel macroscopic distances, like centimeters, in detectors before decaying. Except for very short-lived particles. But this meson is a resonance. Ah, but resonances typically have very short lifetimes, decaying via the strong interaction. So maybe the mean decay length is indeed very small.

But wait, perhaps that comes from an expression. But other mesons, like the J/psi, have a width around 100 keV, leading to lifetimes longer, but even that would be maybe longer? Wait no, resonance widths are actually usually given in MeV. For example, the rho meson has a width around 150 MeV, which would correspond to a very short lifetime.

So perhaps, given the application here, with a width of 320 MeV, the result of femtometers is somewhat expected.

But then, how could they ever detect such a short decay distance? Probably, such resonances decay immediately and are observed via their decay products, through the invariant mass reconstruction. Maybe we should check calculations again.

Wait, let me verify each step.

First, the width Γ is 320 MeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.

Value of ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. That seems correct.

Beta: We have β = p/E. Momentum p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV. So beta = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875.

Gamma is E/m = 8 /1.2 ≈6.6667.

So yes, gamma≈6.6667, β≈0.98875.

Then, total decay length L=βγcτ.

Calculating βγ =6.6667*0.98875≈6.59.

c ≈3e8 m/s. τ ≈2.056e-24 s.

So cτ ≈ 3e8 *2.056e-24 ≈6.168e-16 meters. Multiply by beta gamma ~6.59: 6.168e-16 *6.59≈4.06e-15 meters, which is ~4 femtometers. So slightly smaller than the size of a nucleus (which for uranium is ~15 femtometers). So indeed extremely small.

So the mean decay distance is around 4 femtometers, which is consistent with something that decays basically immediately upon production. So because it is a resonance and has a very large width (therefore short lifetime), it doesn't travel any significant distance before decaying. Therefore, the answer is roughly 4e-15 meters, but let me check if the calculation holds. Wait, except perhaps the units. Wait, perhaps in particle physics, people use the same unit system where c=1. Let me make sure.

Wait, in natural units (c=1, ħ=0.1973 GeV·fm). Wait, this may be a better approach. Because combining units might be easier.

Ah sure! Maybe it I convert meters into femtometers and use natural units where ħ and c are in appropriate terms.

Let me try again.

In natural units (c=1, ħ=0.1973 GeV·fm), so 1 GeV^-1 = ħ c / (1 GeV) = 0.1973 GeV·fm / GeV =0.1973 fm. So 1 GeV^-1 ≈0.1973 femtometers.

But gamma*beta*tau needs to be calculated in these units.

Given τ is the lifetime, gamma * tau gives the lab frame lifetime.

But spacetime in units where c=1 and ħ=0.1973 GeV·fm.

Wait, perhaps more properly: if we express everything in terms of GeV and using c=1 and ħ=0.1973 GeV·fm.

But let's try proceeding step by step.

Tau is ħ / Gamma.

But Gamma is in GeV. So to compute tau in natural units (GeV^-1), we have tau = ħ / Gamma_GeV. Then to express tau in seconds, we use ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s. But the problem is, to compute the decay length, we can work entirely in natural units.

In natural units, with c=1, the mean decay length is L = beta * gamma * tau, where the units are tricky. But in natural units, L can be directly calculated if we use proper conversions. Remember that 1 GeV⁻¹ ≈ 0.1973 x10⁻15 m (femtometers). So if I compute the decay length in GeV⁻¹, then multiply by 0.1973 fm to get meters.

Let me attempt that.

In natural units:

tau = ħ / Gamma = (0.1973 GeV·fm) / (0.32 GeV) ≈ 0.1973 / 0.32 fm ≈0.6166 fm. Wait, but that doesn't take into account c, I think.

Alternatively, if I consider that in natural units (c=1), time and space have the same units. So tau in GeV⁻¹ is ħ_c / Gamma, where ħc ≈0.1973 GeV·fm. So yes, so lifetime in natural units (GeV⁻¹) is (0.1973 GeV·fm)/Gamma(GeV). So after simplification, divided by Gamma gives fm.

Wait, for time (tau) in GeV⁻¹, converting to distance via multiplying by c (so since c=1 in these units, 1 GeV⁻¹ of time is ~ 0.1973 fm).

But maybe I should use another approach.

Alternatively, units:

Given ħc ≈197.3 MeV·fm. So:

Since our Gamma is 320 MeV, converting to fm:

tau = ħ / Gamma = (197.3 MeV·fm)/ (320 MeV) ) / c.

Wait, but I need to track units:

Wait, in units where c=1, time and length have the same units (converted by factors of c).

But clearly, dividing energy gives [hbar*c]/(Energy) = [MeV·fm]/(MeV)= fm → so width in MeV gives τ in fm/c.

Wait, perhaps confusing. Let me use the formula T (seconds) = hbar / Gamma (energy units). But 1 MeV = 1.6e-13 J; ħ in J·s is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

But maybe an accepted approach:

Mean path length = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, there is a standard formula:

L = c * tau_0 * gamma * beta,

where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (rest frame lifetime). Because in the rest frame, the lifetime is tau_0, but from the lab frame, the lifetime is boosted by gamma, so the decay time is gamma*tau_0. Then during that time, moving at speed v = beta c, so distance is v * gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma tau0.

So formula is being used: L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Alternatively, L = beta gamma c tau_0. But in which units?

But c tau0 already gives length? tau0 is time, but in natural units where c=1, so tau0 in time, multiplied by c to give meters. Alright.

So step-by-step:

1. Fundamental equation: L = beta gamma c tau_0.

2. Calculate tau_0 from Gamma. Tau_0 = hbar / Gamma.

First, convert all energies into the same unit:

Gamma = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

The value of hbar in GeV·seconds:

1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J

So hbar = 1.05457e-34 J·s = 1.05457e-34 J·s / 1.602e-10 J/GeV ≈6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Hence, tau0 = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV ≈2.056e-25 s.

Wait, hold on: previous calculation had 6.582e-25 /0.32≈2.056e-24. Wait, division:

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 6.582/0.32=20.56875; 20.56875e-25=2.056875e-24. So tau0=2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, L= beta gamma c tau0.

Calculate c tau0 first: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈6.1706e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma≈0.98875*6.6667≈6.59.

So L≈6.1706e-16 m *6.59≈4.07e-15 m.

That's 4.07 femtometers.

But mesons such as the rho meson, if their decay length is a femtometer, which is about the size of a nucleus, so they decay immediately. Therefore, resonances cannot be detected directly but through their decay products.

Therefore, led by final checking, that would be the average distance. Wait a second, perhaps there is a typo, maybe someone vibes because production energy is E=8GeV—that would imply that the meson was produced with kinetic energy 8 GeV, but actually the energy given is stated as production energy; maybe the meson's total energy is 8 GeV.

Anyway, given that we have E =8 GeV, and m=1.2 GeV, and calculated properly the momentum. Perhaps another crosscheck: let's compute the velocity, beta, as sqrt(1 - (m^2/E²)). Then beta = sqrt(1 - (1.44/64)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775)≈0.9887. So indeed that's correct.

Then, gamma = E/m=8/1.2≈6.666, so gamma≈6.666.

So rest of the calculation.

Thinking several times, yes, maybe 4 femtometers is correct.

But maybe the particle data group lists formulas. Let me recall the formula.

Wait, PDG says cτ for the proper mean path length. But with a speed beta, from gamma, we multiply.

Alternatively, mean path length L = beta gamma c tau. Which is what we used.

So total decay length scale is c * mean lifetime (dilated) times velocity.

To sum up, in the end, the meson resonance X with a very large width (τ very small, gamma somewhat large) gives a femtometer decay length. Definitely that's the case.

Alternatively, if the production energy was in beam energy/speed, but given "production energy is 8 GeV", but since mass is 1.2 GeV, that might be relativistic. So that factor of 6.66 for gamma gives relatively strong time dilation. But even multiplied by subatomic second and femtometer comes to.

Wait, so if the mean decay distance L is calculated properly to be about 4.07e-15 m, would that be the answer?

But do I need to convert femtometers to meters? 1 meter is 1e15 femtometers. Hmm, So 4.07e-15 m is 4.07 femtometers.

Alternatively, in some contexts, mean decay lengths are expressed in millimeters or centimeters, but that's for weakly decaying particles. For instance, B mesons have cτ around hundreds of microns. Aha.

But let me check typical decay lengths versus widths.

For example, the Z boson has a width around 2.5 GeV. So, the lifetime tau = ħ / Gamma = 6.58e-25 GeV·s / 2.5 GeV ≈ 2.63e-25 seconds. Then, Z bosons are produced at rest, maybe, so speed zero? But in reality, production would be in colliders, maybe they are moving with relativistic speeds. But the Z lifetime is around ~3e-25 s, so even if moving at c, the path length is ~7e-17 meters kind of which is still femtometers.

Therefore, a standard particle decay with a width in the hundreds of MeV would have mean decay lengths in the femtometers scale. So this answer makes sense.

Therefore, in conclusion, after all these steps, the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X is approximately 4.07e-15 meters, or about 4 femtometers. So, rounded sensor written as say 4.1e-15 m or preserving two significant figures from the given values.

Wait, the given numbers: mass 1.2 (two significant digits?) , width 320 (three significant digits: 320 vs 3.2e2 vs 32), but if, possible, let’s check:

Initial problem: "mass \m_{X}=1.2GeV, and the width Γ_{X}=320MeV." Maybe m_X is two significant figures, Γ is three? Then possibly results are reported in two or three significant digits.

In our calculation, it's to. Error analysis.

But perhaps conservative to think that 1.2 GeV and 8 GeV (some significant figures in E). Hmm…

If E=8 GeV: would that be one significant figure? If written verbatim 8 is one, 8.0 is two. But unsure.

If assuming they are two significant figures in E, one in m_X=1.2 (possibly two: 1.2 is two), and three in Γ=320 (three as 3,2,0). Maybe: but tricky.

But to be safe, if E=8 GeV is one significant figure, maï¿½tre.

But m issue**; hence person might go on two significant figures for the final Product, with L ≈4.1e-15 m, or explicitly 4.1 femtometers. But exponential notation wise:

Given that 1.2 is two sig figs, 320 (three sig figs), energy given as 8 GeV (presumed as one or two, but written as single-digit-number presented as however digits). 8 GeV could be one. Potentially, based on that rough estimates, 4.1 femtometers if written more precisely.

Alternatively, since calculated ≈4.07e-15 m, it may be standardized to correct it as 4.07e-15 m.

But in high-energy physics, the answer might be written in natural units first. Let me try thinking one more way. If natural units, in accelerator physics, you often inject everything into τ and c.

Wait,, in natural units (c=1, ħ=0.1973 GeV·fm), and everything expressed in terms of eV.

So Gamma: 0.32 GeV.

Thus, factor used to Camera geo give lifetime... Wait:

Our formula:

L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

But natural units, in conversion factors: because L would be in meters, tau in seconds, and c is m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps write in terms of ħc, and MeV or GeV. Assume lack of confusion.

But converting... Actually, adding perspective in high-energy: the key factor is:

  L = (gamma * beta) * (c*tau).


Here, An expression as c*Tau: done already, 6.17e-16 m. Which is 0.617 femtometers. Then multiply by gamma beta≈6.59 gives total L≈4.07 femtometers. Which again is the same result.

Summing up, no mistakes spotted. Concluded  4.07e-15 m, or 4.1 femtometers.

In High-energy physicist terms, this is satisfactory.

So positive** nitpick myself machine response box here.


**Final Answer**
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the mean decay distance of this meson resonance X. Let me start by recalling what I know about particle decays. The mean decay distance, or the average distance a particle travels before decaying, probably has something to do with its lifetime and its velocity. Right, the formula should be something like the product of the speed times the lifetime, right? So if I can find the lifetime and the velocity, I can multiply them to get the mean decay distance.

Alright, first things first. The lifetime. I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the width of a particle's resonance (Γ) to its mean lifetime (τ) through the equation Γ = ħ / τ. Since Γ is given as 320 MeV, I need to convert that into units where we can relate it to time. But wait, ħ is in units of GeV·s when converting from natural units. So let me recall the value of ħ in those terms. I think ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. So then, τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense.

Let me jot that down. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Then τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Simplifying that, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. So the lifetime τ is roughly 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hold on, that seems extremely short, but maybe that's correct for a resonance. Resonances typically have very short lifetimes because they decay via the strong interaction, right? So yeah, this must be in the right ballpark.

Okay, next I need to find the velocity of the meson X. The production energy is given as 8 GeV, and its mass is 1.2 GeV. Wait, but energy here might be the total energy, including rest mass. To find the velocity, I should relate the total energy, mass, and momentum. Let's recall that E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. But since we are dealing with natural units (where c=1), this simplifies to E² = p² + m². So the energy E is 8 GeV, the mass m is 1.2 GeV. So, solving for momentum p: p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV.

Calculating that: 8 squared is 64, and 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56, then square root of 62.56. Let me compute that. sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV. So the momentum p ≈ 7.91 GeV. Since in natural units, momentum p is in GeV/c but c=1, so just GeV.

But wait, velocity. How to get the velocity from this? Let's remember that in natural units, velocity β = p/E. Because β = v/c, and since in units where c=1, β = v. Then from relativity, the momentum p = γ m v, and E = γ m c², so dividing p by E gives v/(c²). But if c=1, p/E = v. So yes, β = p/E. Given p is 7.91 GeV and E is 8 GeV, β ≈ 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. So the velocity is approximately 0.98875 times the speed of light.

So if the velocity is 0.98875c, then in standard units, to get the velocity in m/s, it's 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. But actually, maybe we can use it in terms of c, because when calculating the mean path length, we can write it as βγcτ. Wait, let me think. The mean decay length is typically given by βγcτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Hmm, so maybe I made a step too fast earlier. Let me confirm the correct formula.

Wait, the mean proper lifetime is τ. But due to time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is γτ. Then the mean decay distance L is velocity multiplied by the lab frame lifetime. So L = v * γτ. Since v = βc, and γ = E/m_X, if E is the total energy.

Let me check that: γ is E/mc², since in natural units E = gamma m c². So since E is 8 GeV and m_X is 1.2 GeV, then γ = E / m_X = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666...

So gamma is ~6.666... Then, the mean decay length is beta * gamma * c * tau. Let's calculate this step by step.

We have gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

We already calculated beta = p / E = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. Alternatively, beta can be computed from gamma as sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Let's check:

1/γ = 1.2 /8 = 0.15, so gamma squared is (6.6667)^2≈44.444. So 1/γ² ≈ 0.0225, so sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.9775)≈0.9887, which matches the previous value. So beta=0.9887 approx.

So now, gamma*beta is ≈6.6667 *0.9887≈6.59. Then multiply by c*tau. What is tau?

Tau we said is ~2.056875e-24 seconds. So then c is 3e8 m/s. So calculating gamma*beta* c *tau:

First, multiply gamma*beta ≈6.59.

# Anthropic completion

"I need to calculate the mean decay distance of meson resonance X by finding the lifetime and velocity, then multiplying them together.

For the lifetime, I can use the uncertainty principle where Γ = ħ / τ. Given that Γ = 320 MeV (or 0.32 GeV) and ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, I can calculate τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV ≈ 2.056875 × 10^-24 seconds. This extremely short lifetime makes sense for a resonance that decays via the strong interaction.

Next, I need the velocity of meson X. With a production energy of 8 GeV and mass of 1.2 GeV, I can use E² = p² + m² in natural units. Solving for momentum: p = √(E² - m²) = √(64 - 1.44) = √62.56 ≈ 7.91 GeV.

To find velocity, I recall that β = p/E in natural units. So β = 7.91/8 ≈ 0.98875, meaning the velocity is approximately 0.98875 times the speed of light, or about 2.966 × 10^8 m/s.

For the mean decay length, I need to account for time dilation. The formula is L = v × γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. Since γ = E/m = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667, I can verify this matches with calculating γ from β as 1/√(1-β²).

So β = 0.98875 and γ ≈ 6.6667, giving γβ ≈ 6.6667 × 0.98875 ≈ 6.59. 

The mean decay distance will be γβcτ, where I've calculated γβ ≈ 6.59 and τ ≈ 2.056875 × 10^-24 seconds, with c = 3 × 10^8 m/s."

Alright, so I need to determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X. Let me begin by revisiting what I know about particle decay. The mean decay distance, or the average distance a particle travels before decaying, is likely related to its lifetime and velocity. Right, the equation should be the product of speed and lifetime. So, if I identify the lifetime and velocity, I can multiply them to find the mean decay distance.

First off, the lifetime. I recall that the uncertainty principle associates a particle's resonance width (Γ) with its mean lifetime (τ) through the equation Γ = ħ / τ. Given that Γ is 320 MeV, I need to convert this unit to relate it to time. However, ħ is in GeV·s when converting from natural units. Let me remember the value of ħ: approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Thus, τ = ħ / Γ. That sounds right.

Jotting this down, Γ is 320 MeV, translating to 0.32 GeV. Hence, τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Simplifying, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. So the lifetime τ is around 2.056875e-24 seconds. This seems incredibly short, but perhaps this is appropriate for a resonance, as resonances generally have very brief lifetimes due to strong interaction decay. So yes, this looks accurate.

Next, I need the meson X's velocity. The production energy is 8 GeV, with a mass of 1.2 GeV. Nevertheless, the energy may include rest mass. To deduce velocity, I should link total energy, mass, and momentum. Recall that E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. But in natural units (where c=1), this reduces to E² = p² + m². Thus, given energy E is 8 GeV and mass m is 1.2 GeV, we solve for momentum p: p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV.

Calculating, 8 squared is 64, and 1.2 squared is 1.44. Thus, 64 - 1.44 = 62.56, and the square root of 62.56 is approximately sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV. Consequently, the momentum p ≈ 7.91 GeV. In natural units, momentum p is in GeV/c, but c=1, so just GeV.

Now for velocity. How to derive velocity from this? Remember that in natural units, velocity β = p/E. Since β = v/c, and with c=1 in these units, β = v. From relativity, p = γ m v and E = γ m c², thus dividing p by E gives v/(c²), but if c=1, that means p/E = v. So β = p/E. With p as 7.91 GeV and E as 8 GeV, β ≈ 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. Therefore, the velocity is approximately 0.98875 times the speed of light.

Given a velocity of 0.98875c, in standard units, that translates to 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. Alternatively, using it in terms of c makes sense; when computing mean path length, it's typically written as βγcτ. Let me confirm the precise formula.

The mean proper lifetime is τ. However, due to time dilation, the lab frame lifetime is γτ. The mean decay distance L is the velocity times the lab frame lifetime, so L = v * γτ. With v = βc and γ = E/m_X, where E is the total energy.

Double-checking: γ is E/mc², and since we have E = γ m c², in natural units, E = γm. Hence, γ = E / m_X = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666...

Thus, gamma is ~6.666... Consequently, the mean decay length becomes beta * gamma * c * tau. Let's compute this.

We've established gamma = E / m = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Earlier, we calculated beta = p / E = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. Beta can also be refined from gamma as sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Verification:

1/γ = 1.2 /8 = 0.15, gamma squared is (6.6667)^2≈44.444. 1/γ² ≈ 0.0225, thus sqrt(1 - 0.0225) ≈ sqrt(0.9775)≈0.9887, confirming the previous value. Hence, beta≈0.9887.

Now, gamma*beta is ≈6.6667 *0.9887≈6.59. Then, multiply by c*tau. As for tau, it is ~2.056875e-24 seconds. Therefore with c being 3e8 m/s, we proceed with gamma*beta* c *tau.

Starting calculation with gamma*beta ≈6.59.

But I thought the strong force is so strong that particles decay pretty much immediately, but sometimes with certain widths, maybe...\n\nBut wait, actually, wait a second. The calculation might have a units problem. Wait, tau is in seconds, yes. Calculation of c*tau gives meters? Because 3e8 m/s multiplied by second is meters. Correct. And Gamma was given in MeV. Let me cross-check.\n\nWait, Γ = 320 MeV. To convert Γ (in GeV) to inverse seconds, I need to use the relation Γ = ħ / tau. Hence, tau = ħ / Gamma.\n\nBut ħ in units of GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

That seems incredibly small, as expected for a resonance. Because particles that decay via the strong interaction typically have lifetimes around 1e-24 seconds, leading to decay lengths on the order of femtometers, which is nuclear scale, so you wouldn't see a track in a detector. So that's probably correct. But let me revisit if I messed up any steps.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, another way to compute mean path length is using L = c * beta * gamma * tau.

But if we use natural units (c=1, so L = beta gamma tau). But tau in natural units is in GeV⁻¹, so L would be in GeV⁻¹. Then convert GeV⁻¹ to meters.\n\nWait, the conversion factor ħc is approximately 0.1973 GeV·fm. So 1 GeV⁻¹ = (hbar c) / GeV ≈0.1973 fm. Therefore, L in natural units (GeV⁻¹) is multiplied by 0.1973 fm to get femtometers.\n\nAlternatively, another way: the formula for decay length is L = (c tau) gamma beta. But if ħ = 0.1973 GeV·fm/c, since 1 fm = 1e-15 m, and c=3e8 m/s. Let's see.\n\nBut maybe this is complicating. Alternatively, perhaps first calculate the lifetime tau with appropriate factors.\n\nWait, so with Gamma = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. Then, the lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma. hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau = 6.582e-25 /0.32 ≈2.056e-24 seconds. Then, gamma is 8/(1.2)≈6.6667. Beta is 0.98875. Then L = tau * beta gamma c.\n\nSo tau is 2.056e-24 s. Multiply by betaγ ≈6.59. Then multiply by c=3e8 m/s. Let's calculate that:\n\n2.056e-24 s *6.59 ≈1.355e-23 s. Then times 3e8 m/s: 1.355e-23 s *3e8 m/s≈4.065e-15 m≈4.065 femtometers. So this matches our previous result.\n\nHmmm. So according to this calculation, the mean decay distance is about 4.07 femtometers, which is 4.07e-15 meters.\n\nBut this seems really, really small. For instance, typical nuclear sizes are on the order of femtometers (1e-15 meters). A mean decay length of 4 femtometers would mean the particle decays almost immediately after production, within the size of a nucleus.\n\nBut resonances generally do decay very quickly; they don't travel measurable distances, so they don't leave tracks in particle detectors. Their existence is inferred from invariant mass peaks. So in that case, getting a decay length on the order of femtometers is actually correct. So maybe this result makes sense.\n\nBut wait, double-check. Let me also check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the mean decay length can be calculated as L = (p c / m_X) * ħ c / (Γ c)\n\nWait, that comes from combining τ = ħ / Γ, and then L = beta gamma c tau = (p/m_X)* (ħ / Γ) *c.\n\nWait:\n\nBecause beta gamma is p/(m_X c). Wait in natural units c is 1. So in standard units, maybe that would be:\n\ngamma beta = (p c)/(m_X c²) * c = p/(m_X c).\n\nTherefore, L = gamma beta c tau = (p/(m_X c)) * c tau = (p/m_X) * tau * c²? Not sure, maybe better to start from the formula.\n\nWait, let's write the formula again. The decay length in the lab frame is L = v tau_{lab}, where tau_{lab} is the dilated lifetime: tau_{lab} = gamma tau. Therefore, L = v gamma tau.\n\nBut v = beta c = (p c^2)/E, since p = gamma m v, so p c = gamma m v c, but E = gamma m c² ==> p c = (E / c) (v / c). So v = (p c^2)/E.\n\nBut not sure that's helpful. Let's have variables:\n\nGiven E =8 GeV (total energy), m=1.2 GeV, Γ=0.32 GeV.\n\nGamma= E / m =8/1.2≈6.6667.\n\nBeta is sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2)≈sqrt(1 -0.0225)≈sqrt(0.9775)≈0.9887.\n\nTau =hbar /Γ≈6.582e-25 GeV s /0.32 GeV≈2.056e-25 s (Wait, when I calculated earlier, I must have made a mistake here, perhaps!).\n\nWait, wait, No:\n\nWait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32: 6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s? Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Which was correct. So 2.056875e-24 s.\n\nThen gamma=6.6667.\n\nbeta=0.9887.\n\nSo L= beta * gamma * c * tau.\n\nComputing that:\n\ngamma * beta =6.6667 *0.9887≈6.59.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\ntau=2.0568e-24 s.\n\nSo L=6.59*3e8*2.0568e-24=6.59 *6.1704e-16≈4.067e-15 meters=4.067 femtometers.\n\nSame answer. So the calculation seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, answer approximately 4.07 femtometers.\n\nBut checking units again. To ensure the conversions are correct. Let's verify:\n\n1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J,\n\nBut maybe not so helpful. Let me check using the conversion factor ħ c ≈197.3 MeV fm. Well, if we use τ = ħ /Γ, so\n\nΓ is 320 MeV. Then τ = (197.3 MeV fm / c) / (320 MeV) = (197.3 / 320) fm / c. (wait, since ħ c ≈197.3 MeV fm ==> ħ = 197.3 MeV fm / c).\n\nTherefore, τ= ħ /Γ= (197.3 MeV fm / c)/ (320 MeV)= (197.3/320) fm /c ≈0.6166 fm/c.\n\nBut in particle physics, we often use c=1 in natural units. Thus τ is in fm/c. But in terms of lab frame, we need to multiply by gamma to get the lab lifetime, then multiply by v to get decay length.\n\nWait, perhaps using gamma here would be helpful.\n\nSo in natural units (c=1, distance in fm, time in fm/c). Then using this, calculating L = beta gamma tau, where tau=0.6166 fm (from above calculation: 197.3/320 ≈0.6166 fm).\n\nBut beta gamma is v gamma, and beta=p/E. In natural units (E in GeV, or other? Wait, better in MeV to keep units the same. Let's use MeV. Since Γ=320 MeV, m=1200 MeV, E=8000 MeV.\n\nThen compute p: p=sqrt(E² -m²)=sqrt(8000² -1200²). Wait, 8000 squared is 64,000,000. 1200 squared is 1,440,000. So 64,000,000 -1,440,000=62,560,000. So sqrt(62,560,000)=7,912 MeV. So as before, p≈7,912 MeV.\n\nThen beta = p/E =7912/8000≈0.9889.\n\n gamma=E/m=8000/1200=6.6667.\n\nTherefore, beta gamma=0.9889*6.6667≈6.593.\n\nThen, tau= ħ/Γ= (197.3 MeV fm)/ (320 MeV)=197.3/320 fm≈0.6166 fm.\n\nTherefore, if we compute in natural units L = beta gamma tau ≈6.593*0.6166 fm≈4.065 fm.\n\nWhich is ~4.065 femtometers. Exactly same answer.\n\nTherefore, confirms the calculation.\n\nHence, pulling it all together, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. That’s very tiny, which makes sense for a resonance with a large width (short lifetime).\n\nJust to confirm, often particles with widths of hundreds of MeV have lifetimes on the order of 1e-24 seconds, which leads to femtometer decay lengths. For example, the rho meson has a width of about 150 MeV, leading to a similar calculation yielding a decay length of ~1.3 femtometers, which is indeed why rho mesons are considered resonances and don't travel measurable distances. Similarly, our X meson here has a width twice as large (320 MeV), leading to an even shorter lifetime, but here the higher gamma factor from the production energy might compensate. Wait, original question is production energy of 8 GeV. If the particle is moving with gamma~6.666, so even though lifetime is shorter due to higher width, the Lorentz gamma factor is due to high energy production. So overall decay length can be higher than rho meson but still very small.\n\nSo after carefully looking into different ways to compute this, and rechecking the units, the answer of approximately 4.07 femtometers seems correct. It’s possible the negative stuck at first because of the small numbers involved, but resonance particles do have such minuscule decay lengths.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean decay distance is \\boxed{4.1 \\text{ fm}}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743847625, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3291, prompt_tokens=1337, total_tokens=4628, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we need to consider its lifetime and velocity. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Lifetime Calculation**:
   - The width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - Using the uncertainty principle, \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X} \).
   - \(\hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s}\).
   - \(\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s}}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \).

2. **Velocity Calculation**:
   - The total energy \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - Relativistic momentum \( p = \sqrt{E^2 - m_X^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - Velocity \( \beta = \frac{p}{E} \approx \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875 \).

3. **Lorentz Factor (Gamma)**:
   - Lorentz factor \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667 \).

4. **Mean Decay Distance**:
   - The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by \( L = \beta \gamma c \tau \).
   - Convert \( \tau \) to meters using \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
   - \( L = 0.98875 \times 6.6667 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 4.07 \, \text{fm} \).

Thus, the mean decay distance is \(\boxed{4.1 \text{ fm}}\).

Then, c ≈3e8 m/s, so c*tau ≈3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s≈6.1706e-16 m.

Then multiply this by gamma*beta (≈6.59):

6.59 * 6.1706e-16 m ≈4.067e-15 m??? Wait that's 4.067 femtometers? That seems way too short. The strong interaction scale is femtometers, so a particle decaying via the strong force would have a decay length that is nuclear scale.

But ħ in units of GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So yes, tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈2.056e-24 seconds. So c*tau is 3e8 *2.056e-24 ≈6.17e-16 meters, which is 0.617 femtometers.

But then, multiplied by gamma*beta (~6.59) gets us to ~4.07 femtometers. That seems incredibly small, as expected for a resonance.

Hmm, but actually, yes, we can redo the calculation. Maybe using E = gamma m, beta is p/E, and Gamma = ħ / tau. Maybe relating everything through.

Alternatively, if I wanted to write L in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, then distance is 1/(GeV) time some factors. Wait, but converting back to meters here complicates.

Wait, maybe it would make sense to calculate this in natural units first. Let me try that.

In natural units (c=1, ħ=0.1973 GeV·fm), which might help. Since we need to get the result in meters or femtometers.

So tau in natural units is inverse GeV. But using Gamma in GeV implies that tau is (GeV)^-1. To get tau in seconds, we have to multiply by ħ in GeV·s. But for conversion to distance, perhaps working in natural units will make the calculation easier.

So, the mean decay length is L = beta gamma c tau. But if we use natural units (c=1, so L = beta gamma tau). But tau in natural units is in GeV⁻¹, so L would be in GeV⁻¹. Then convert GeV⁻¹ to meters.

Wait, the conversion factor ħc is approximately 0.1973 GeV·fm. So 1 GeV⁻¹ = (hbar c) / GeV ≈0.1973 fm. Therefore, L in natural units (GeV⁻¹) is multiplied by 0.1973 fm to get femtometers.

Alternatively, another way: the formula for decay length is L = (c tau) gamma beta. But if ħ = 0.1973 GeV·fm/c, since 1 fm = 1e-15 m, and c=3e8 m/s. Let's see.

But maybe this is complicating. Alternatively, perhaps first calculate the lifetime tau with appropriate factors.

Wait, so with Gamma = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. Then, the lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma. hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So tau = 6.582e-25 /0.32 ≈2.056e-24 seconds. Then, gamma is 8/(1.2)≈6.6667. Beta is 0.98875. Then L = tau * beta gamma c.

So tau is 2.056e-24 s. Multiply by betaγ ≈6.59. Then multiply by c=3e8 m/s. Let's calculate that:

2.056e-24 s *6.59 ≈1.355e-23 s. Then times 3e8 m/s: 1.355e-23 s *3e8 m/s≈4.065e-15 m≈4.065 femtometers. So this matches our previous result.

Hmmm. So according to this calculation, the mean decay distance is about 4.07 femtometers, which is 4.07e-15 meters.

But this seems really, really small. For instance, typical nuclear sizes are on the order of femtometers (1e-15 meters). A mean decay length of 4 femtometers would mean the particle decays almost immediately after production, within the size of a nucleus.

So in that case, getting a decay length on the order of femtometers is actually correct. So maybe this result makes sense.

But wait, double-check. Let me also check with another approach.

Alternatively, the mean decay length can be calculated as L = (p c / m_X) * ħ c / (Γ c)

Wait, that comes from combining τ = ħ / Γ, and then L = beta gamma c tau = (p/m_X)* (ħ / Γ) *c.

Wait:

Because beta gamma is p/(m_X c). Wait in natural units c is 1. So in standard units, maybe that would be:

gamma beta = (p c)/(m_X c²) * c = p/(m_X c).

Therefore, L = gamma beta c tau = (p/(m_X c)) * c tau = (p/m_X) * tau * c²? Not sure, maybe better to start from the formula.

Wait, let's write the formula again. The decay length in the lab frame is L = v tau_{lab}, where tau_{lab} is the dilated lifetime: tau_{lab} = gamma tau. Therefore, L = v gamma tau.

But v = beta c = (p c^2)/E, since p = gamma m v, so p c = gamma m v c, but E = gamma m c² ==> p c = (E / c) (v / c). So v = (p c^2)/E.

But not sure that's helpful. Let's have variables:

Given E =8 GeV (total energy), m=1.2 GeV, Γ=0.32 GeV.

Gamma= E / m =8/1.2≈6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2)≈sqrt(1 -0.0225)≈sqrt(0.9775)≈0.9887.

Tau =hbar /Γ≈6.582e-25 GeV s /0.32 GeV≈2.056e-25 s (Wait, when I calculated earlier, I must have made a mistake here, perhaps!).

Wait, wait, No:

Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32: 6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s? Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Which was correct. So 2.056875e-24 s.

Then gamma=6.6667.

beta=0.9887.

So L= beta * gamma * c * tau.

Computing that:

gamma * beta =6.6667 *0.9887≈6.59.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau=2.0568e-24 s.

So L=6.59*3e8*2.0568e-24=6.59 *6.1704e-16≈4.067e-15 meters=4.067 femtometers.

Same answer. So the calculation seems consistent.

Therefore, answer approximately 4.07 femtometers.

But checking units again. To ensure the conversions are correct. Let's verify:

1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J,

But maybe not so helpful. Let me check using the conversion factor ħ c ≈197.3 MeV fm. Well, if we use τ = ħ /Γ, so

Γ is 320 MeV. Then τ = (197.3 MeV fm / c) / (320 MeV) = (197.3 / 320) fm / c. (wait, since ħ c ≈197.3 MeV fm ==> ħ = 197.3 MeV fm / c).

Therefore, τ= ħ /Γ= (197.3 MeV fm / c)/ (320 MeV)= (197.3/320) fm /c ≈0.6166 fm/c.

But in particle physics, we often use c=1 in natural units. Thus τ is in fm/c. But in terms of lab frame, we need to multiply by gamma to get the lab lifetime, then multiply by v to get decay length.

Wait, perhaps using gamma here would be helpful.

So in natural units (c=1, distance in fm, time in fm/c). Then using this, calculating L = beta gamma tau, where tau=0.6166 fm (from above calculation: 197.3/320 ≈0.6166 fm).

But beta gamma is v gamma, and beta=p/E. In natural units (E in GeV, or other? Wait, better in MeV to keep units the same. Let's use MeV. Since Γ=320 MeV, m=1200 MeV, E=8000 MeV.

Then compute p: p=sqrt(E² -m²)=sqrt(8000² -1200²). Wait, 8000 squared is 64,000,000. 1200 squared is 1,440,000. So 64,000,000 -1,440,000=62,560,000. So sqrt(62,560,000)=7,912 MeV. So as before, p≈7,912 MeV.

Then beta = p/E =7912/8000≈0.9889.

 gamma=E/m=8000/1200=6.6667.

Therefore, beta gamma=0.9889*6.6667≈6.593.

Then, tau= ħ/Γ= (197.3 MeV fm)/ (320 MeV)=197.3/320 fm≈0.6166 fm.

Therefore, if we compute in natural units L = beta gamma tau ≈6.593*0.6166 fm≈4.065 fm.

Which is ~4.065 femtometers. Exactly same answer.

Therefore, confirms the calculation.

Hence, pulling it all together, the mean decay distance is approximately 4.07 femtometers. That’s very tiny, which makes sense for a resonance with a large width (short lifetime).

Just to confirm, often particles with widths of hundreds of MeV have lifetimes on the order of 1e-24 seconds, which leads to femtometer decay lengths. For example, the rho meson has a width of about 150 MeV, leading to a similar calculation yielding a decay length of ~1.3 femtometers, which is indeed why rho mesons are considered resonances and don't travel measurable distances. Similarly, our X meson here has a width twice as large (320 MeV), leading to an even shorter lifetime, but here the higher gamma factor from the production energy might compensate. Wait, original question is production energy of 8 GeV. If the particle is moving with gamma~6.666, so even though lifetime is shorter due to higher width, the Lorentz gamma factor is due to high energy production. So overall decay length can be higher than rho meson but still very small.

So after carefully looking into different ways to compute this, and rechecking the units, the answer of approximately 4.07 femtometers seems correct. It’s possible the negative stuck at first because of the small numbers involved, but resonance particles do have such minuscule decay lengths.

**Final Answer**
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \text{ fm}}.

Let me check: the lifetime in the lab frame is τₗ = γ × τ_rest. But once I have velocity as v = βc, then the mean decay length is L = v × τₗ = βc × γ τ. Alternatively, since γ = E/(m c²) in SI units. However, in natural units (GeV and MeV), with c=1, it's simpler with β and γ.\n\nSo calculating γ = E/m_x= 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666..., which is correct. The lifetime seen in lab frame is calculated correctly as gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Then the mean path length L = beta c gamma tau.\n\nWait, but let's use correct SI units. Although, let me check units:\nIn natural units, if tau is in seconds, then multiply by c to get meters. Let me verify everything step by step again.\n\nFirst, width Γ is 320 MeV. For resonance particles, the lifetime τ is given by ħ/Γ. Since ħ is ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Convert Γ from 320 MeV to GeV: 0.32 GeV. Then τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.\n\nVelocity: We have energy E=8 GeV, mass m=1.2 GeV, so p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV (since in natural units, c=1, so momentum and energy in GeV when masses are in GeV/c²; but okay). Therefore, beta = p / E = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875. Velocity is 0.98875c.\n\nThe Lorentz gamma factor is E/m_x where m_x =1.2 GeV. So gamma =8 /1.2≈6.6667.\n\nDecay length L = v gamma tau. v = 0.98875c ; gamma already includes the time dilation. But hold on: wait, the actual lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Then, the decay length is gamma *tau* velocity. So yes, L=gamma *tau* beta *c.\n\nSo L=beta c gamma tau. Plugging numbers: beta ≈0.98875, gamma≈6.6667, tau=approx 2.056e-24 s, c=3e8 m/s.\n\nMultiply them together: 0.98875 *6.6667= approx 6.59. Then 6.59 * 2.056e-24 s *3e8 m/s. Let's see: 6.59 * 2.056e-24 ≈1.356e-23. Then multiply by 3e8 m/s: 1.356e-23 *3e8 = 4.067e-15 meters. Wait, that's about 4.07 femtometers. But that seems very short. Is that correct?\n\nWait, that seems way too short. Non-relativistically, if the lifetime is 2e-24 seconds and velocity is 0.988c, then distance would be 3e8 m/s * 2e-24 s *0.988 ≈ 5.9e-16 meters, or 0.59 femtometers. But with gamma=6.66, so that adds another factor. So 6.66 * 0.59 ~ 3.93 femtometers. So in this case, approx 4e-15 meters.\n\nBut wait, but the result sounds too small. Since femtometers are the scale of nuclear sizes. Particle decays, in practice. Let me think, for example, the pion's mean decay length. Charged pions at rest decay via the weak interaction with lifetime ~2.6e-8 seconds, but if they are moving relativistically, their decay lengths can be meters or more. However, here, we are dealing with a resonance (so a very short-lived particle).\n\nBut our particle here has a width Γ =320 MeV. The relationship between width and lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. For example, if Γ ~ 100 MeV, we get τ ~ 6.6e-25 GeV·s / 0.1 GeV ≈ 6.6e-24 seconds.\n\nWait, given that for example, the rho meson has Γ ~150 MeV, which leads tau about ~4.4e-24 seconds, but since it's such a short lifetime, the decay length is indeed very small. But how to check whether the calculation is correct.\n\nThere's another factor here: particle X is created with energy 8 GeV, and mass 1.2 GeV. So gamma factor for that particle is E/m = 8 / 1.2 ~6.666, which gives gamma of about ~6.666. Therefore, the lab frame lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime. Even with high gamma, but since proper lifetime is 2.05e-24 s, then the lab frame lifetime is ~1.37e-23 seconds. Then, multiplied by the velocity ~0.988c, so L= 0.988 *3e8 m/s *1.37e-23 s = 0.988 *3e8 *1.37e-23 = 4.08e-15 m. So, approximately 4 femtometers.\n\nIs this plausible? The strong interaction time scales are indeed very short, so the mean decay length being around ~1 femtometer makes sense, but maybe 4 fm is right. The key steps are: tau= ħ /Γ, beta= p/E_energy, gamma=E/mass. Then compute by multipling beta*c*gamma*tau.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me verify all unit conversions.\n\nΓ in GeV: 320 MeV =0.32 GeV. \n\nSo τ=6.582x10^-25 GeV·s /0.32 GeV ≈ 2.056x10^-24 seconds. Gamma calculation correct E/mX=8/1.2 ≈6.6667. Velocity beta: p= sqrt(E² -m^2) = sqrt(8² -1.2²)= sqrt(64 -1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV (since in natural units where c=1, so if e.g., E is in GeV, m in GeV/c², then p is GeV/c. So beta= (pc)/E = (7.91 GeV/c * c)/8 GeV=7.91/8≈0.98875. Thus velocity v=0.98875c.\n\nL= v * tau_lab, and tau_lab= gamma * tau. Yep, exactly.\n\nThen v * tau_lab= 0.98875c * gamma * tau =0.98875 * 6.6667 * 2.056e-24 s * c.\n\nConvert either c to m/s or compute using natural units. Let's compute:\n\n0.98875 *6.6667≈6.585.\n\nSo 6.585 *2.056e-24 s= approx 1.355e-23 seconds.\n\nMultiply by c=3e8 m/s: 1.355e-23 s *3e8 m/s= (1.355*3) *1e-15 m=4.065e-15 meters, approximately 4.07 femtometers.\n\nSo final answer is approximately 4.07 femtometers. That is 4.07x10^-15 meters. But check if using proper unit conversions.\n\nAnother way: Using natural units, where c=3e8 m/s and ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s. Then 1 GeV^-1 ≈6.582e-25 s.\n\nCompute L= gamma * beta * tau * c.\n\nBut  tau (proper) = ħ / Gamma =6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV ≈2.056e-24 s.

To convert from natural units (seconds in energy^-1?) perhaps better step.\n\nBut proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, calculate in natural units then convert.\n\nAssuming natural units, when we compute L=(gamma * beta) (tau in seconds ) *c.\n\nBut total formula is L=0.98875 *6.666... *2.056e-24 s *3e8 m/s.\n\nWhich as we saw, leading to ~4e-15 m.\n\nGiven that 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, that is 4 femtometers. So mean decay distance is approx 4 femtometer. Such small distances would be impossible to measure directly because even the size of a nucleus is several femtometers.

To calculate the mean decay distance of meson resonance \( X \), we follow these steps:

1. **Lifetime Calculation**:
   - Using the uncertainty principle, the lifetime \( \tau \) is given by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \).
   - Given \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \):
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Velocity Calculation**:
   - The momentum \( p \) of the meson is calculated using \( p = \sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2} \):
   \[
   p = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}
   \]
   - The velocity \( \beta \) (in units of \( c \)) is given by \( \beta = \frac{p}{E_X} \):
   \[
   \beta = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875
   \]

3. **Lorentz Factor Calculation**:
   - The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated using \( \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667
   \]

4. **Mean Decay Distance Calculation**:
   - The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by \( L = \beta \gamma c \tau \):
   \[
   L = 0.98875 \times 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
   \]
   - Calculating the product step-by-step:
   \[
   0.98875 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.589
   \]
   \[
   6.589 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 1.355 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
   \]
   \[
   1.355 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
   \]

Thus, the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \) is:

\[
\boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{m}}
\]

But hold on, maybe time dilation comes from E/m. Let me check: the lifetime in the lab frame is τₗ = γ × τ_rest. But once I have velocity as v = βc, then the mean decay length is L = v × τₗ = βc × γ τ. Alternatively, since γ = E/(m c²) in SI units. However, in natural units (GeV and MeV), with c=1, it's simpler with β and γ.

So calculating γ = E/m_x= 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666..., which is correct. The lifetime seen in lab frame is calculated correctly as gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. Then the mean path length L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, but let's use correct SI units. Although, let me check units:
In natural units, if tau is in seconds, then multiply by c to get meters. Let me verify everything step by step again.

First, width Γ is 320 MeV. For resonance particles, the lifetime τ is given by ħ/Γ. Since ħ is ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Convert Γ from 320 MeV to GeV: 0.32 GeV. Then τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds.

Velocity: We have energy E=8 GeV, mass m=1.2 GeV, so p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV (since in natural units, c=1, so momentum and energy in GeV when masses are in GeV/c²; but okay). Therefore, beta = p / E = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875. Velocity is 0.98875c.

The Lorentz gamma factor is E/m_x where m_x =1.2 GeV. So gamma =8 /1.2≈6.6667.

Decay length L = v gamma tau. v = 0.98875c ; gamma already includes the time dilation. But hold on: wait, the actual lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Then, the decay length is gamma *tau* velocity. So yes, L=gamma *tau* beta *c.

So L=beta c gamma tau. Plugging numbers: beta ≈0.98875, gamma≈6.6667, tau=approx 2.056e-24 s, c=3e8 m/s.

Multiply them together: 0.98875 *6.6667= approx 6.59. Then 6.59 * 2.056e-24 s *3e8 m/s. Let's see: 6.59 * 2.056e-24 ≈1.356e-23. Then multiply by 3e8 m/s: 1.356e-23 *3e8 = 4.067e-15 meters. Wait, that's about 4.07 femtometers. But that seems very short. Is that correct?

Wait, that seems way too short. Non-relativistically, if the lifetime is 2e-24 seconds and velocity is 0.988c, then distance would be 3e8 m/s * 2e-24 s *0.988 ≈ 5.9e-16 meters, or 0.59 femtometers. But with gamma=6.66, so that adds another factor. So 6.66 * 0.59 ~ 3.93 femtometers. So in this case, approx 4e-15 meters.

But wait, but the result sounds too small. Since femtometers are the scale of nuclear sizes. Particle decays, in practice. Let me think, for example, the pion's mean decay length. Charged pions at rest decay via the weak interaction with lifetime ~2.6e-8 seconds, but if they are moving relativistically, their decay lengths can be meters or more. However, here, we are dealing with a resonance (so a very short-lived particle).

But our particle here has a width Γ =320 MeV. The relationship between width and lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. For example, if Γ ~ 100 MeV, we get τ ~ 6.6e-25 GeV·s / 0.1 GeV ≈ 6.6e-24 seconds.

Wait, given that for example, the rho meson has Γ ~150 MeV, which leads tau about ~4.4e-24 seconds, but since it's such a short lifetime, the decay length is indeed very small. But how to check whether the calculation is correct.

There's another factor here: particle X is created with energy 8 GeV, and mass 1.2 GeV. So gamma factor for that particle is E/m = 8 / 1.2 ~6.666, which gives gamma of about ~6.666. Therefore, the lab frame lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime. Even with high gamma, but since proper lifetime is 2.05e-24 s, then the lab frame lifetime is ~1.37e-23 seconds. Then, multiplied by the velocity ~0.988c, so L= 0.988 *3e8 m/s *1.37e-23 s = 0.988 *3e8 *1.37e-23 = 4.08e-15 m. So, approximately 4 femtometers.

Is this plausible? The strong interaction time scales are indeed very short, so the mean decay length being around ~1 femtometer makes sense, but maybe 4 fm is right. The key steps are: tau= ħ /Γ, beta= p/E_energy, gamma=E/mass. Then compute by multipling beta*c*gamma*tau.

Just to be thorough, let me verify all unit conversions.

Γ in GeV: 320 MeV =0.32 GeV. 

So τ=6.582x10^-25 GeV·s /0.32 GeV ≈ 2.056x10^-24 seconds. Gamma calculation correct E/mX=8/1.2 ≈6.6667. Velocity beta: p= sqrt(E² -m^2) = sqrt(8² -1.2²)= sqrt(64 -1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV (since in natural units where c=1, so if e.g., E is in GeV, m in GeV/c², then p is GeV/c. So beta= (pc)/E = (7.91 GeV/c * c)/8 GeV=7.91/8≈0.98875. Thus velocity v=0.98875c.

L= v * tau_lab, and tau_lab= gamma * tau. Yep, exactly.

Then v * tau_lab= 0.98875c * gamma * tau =0.98875 * 6.6667 * 2.056e-24 s * c.

Convert either c to m/s or compute using natural units. Let's compute:

0.98875 *6.6667≈6.585.

So 6.585 *2.056e-24 s= approx 1.355e-23 seconds.

Multiply by c=3e8 m/s: 1.355e-23 s *3e8 m/s= (1.355*3) *1e-15 m=4.065e-15 meters, approximately 4.07 femtometers.

So final answer is approximately 4.07 femtometers. That is 4.07x10^-15 meters. But check if using proper unit conversions.

Another way: Using natural units, where c=3e8 m/s and ħ=6.582e-25 GeV·s. Then 1 GeV^-1 ≈6.582e-25 s.

Compute L= gamma * beta * tau * c.

But  tau (proper) = ħ / Gamma =6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV ≈2.056e-24 s. So in natural units (if we set ħ=1, c=1), lifetime tau =1/ Gamma. 

Then, calculation:

In natural units, L= gamma * beta* tau. To convert from natural units (seconds in energy^-1?) perhaps better step.

But proceed step by step.

Alternatively, calculate in natural units then convert.

Assuming natural units, when we compute L=(gamma * beta) (tau in seconds ) *c.

But total formula is L=0.98875 *6.666... *2.056e-24 s *3e8 m/s.

Which as we saw, leading to ~4e-15 m.

Given that 1 femtometer is 1e-15 meters, that is 4 femtometers. So mean decay distance is approx 4 femtometer. Such small distances would be impossible to measure directly because even the size of a nucleus is several femtometers. Thus, resonances can't be directly observed as tracks in detectors, but are inferred from invariant mass peaks. Yep.

Therefore, instructionally this is how it's done.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15}\ \text{m}}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance X, we need to calculate its lifetime and velocity, then combine these using relativistic time dilation and velocity.

1. **Lifetime Calculation**:
   The lifetime \(\tau\) is given by the uncertainty principle:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_X}
   \]
   Given \(\Gamma_X = 320 \text{ MeV} = 0.32 \text{ GeV}\) and \(\hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \text{ GeV·s}\), we find:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \text{ GeV·s}}{0.32 \text{ GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \text{ s}
   \]

2. **Velocity Calculation**:
   The velocity is determined from the production energy \(E_X = 8 \text{ GeV}\) and mass \(m_X = 1.2 \text{ GeV}\). Using the relativistic relation for momentum \(p\):
   \[
   E^2 = p^2 + m_X^2 \implies p = \sqrt{E_X^2 - m_X^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \text{ GeV}
   \]
   The velocity \(\beta\) (as a fraction of the speed of light \(c\)) is:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{p}{E_X} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875
   \]

3. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:
   The Lorentz factor \(\gamma\) is:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
   \]

4. **Mean Decay Distance**:
   The mean decay distance \(L\) combines the velocity, time dilation, and lifetime:
   \[
   L = \beta \gamma c \tau
   \]
   Substituting the values \(\beta \approx 0.98875\), \(\gamma \approx 6.6667\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}\), and \(\tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \text{ s}\):
   \[
   L = 0.98875 \times 6.6667 \times 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \text{ s}
   \]
   Calculating this product:
   \[
   L \approx 4.07 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}
   \]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}.

 c*tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 6.1706e-16 m.

Thus, L = 6.59 * 6.1706e-16 ≈4.067e-15 m. That seems way too small. Wait, that's femtometers, which is of the order of nuclear sizes. But particle physics decay lengths of hadrons (like pions, kaons) are often centimeters or meters for weakly decaying particles. But in this case, the particle X is a resonance with large width Γ=320 MeV, leading to a very short lifetime. Hence, even travelling at near speed of light for a short time leads to very small decay lengths. Resonances typically decay immediately, so I think this makes sense.

Wait, 1 femtometer (1e-15 m) is indeed 1 fermi, which is a typical nuclear or strong interaction length scale. So for a particle with a typical strong decay (i.e. affected by the strong force and hence short-lived), having a mean decay distance of a few fermis is reasonable.

But wait. Another thought: Sometimes, in particle physics, when particles (even those with strong interactions) are observed as part of collider experiments, their mean decay length can be measured. If X is a resonance, perhaps it's not considered a free particle, but when it is produced, its lifetime would still depend on the width. So perhaps the calculation is correct. Let me double-check.

The width Γ is related directly to the lifetime τ via Γ = ħ / τ. So my calculation is τ = ħ / Γ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s)/(0.32 GeV) ≈2.06e-24 seconds. The proper lifetime (particle's own frame). When the particle is moving, relativistic time dilation (gamma factor) comes into play, so t_lab = gamma * tau. Hence, lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau, so decay distance is beta * c * gamma * tau.

Wait, β and gamma relations:

Since gamma = E/m and beta = p/E, as per special relativity, yes. So gamma*beta*c*tau = (E/m)(p/E) *c *tau = (p/m)*c*tau. Alternatively, with p = gamma m beta. But maybe better to use the time dilation that in lab frame, the time is gamma*tau, and the velocity is beta c. So L = beta c gamma tau.

Alternatively, since macroscopic motion, it's gamma*(beta c) * tau. Which combines as gamma beta c tau. Hmm.

But maybe natural units clarified. They often use c=1 units. Then, L= beta gamma c tau. But if natural units are used where c=1, perhaps multiply by 1 for unit conversion? Wait naturally the speed is 0.9887, but how do they convert?

Potentially conversion from seconds and natural units to meters. But perhaps the more precise formula is L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Alternatively, loreniz factor docs. Yes, lifetime in lab frame is gamma*tau. Therefore L = v * gamma tau.

Therefore, v is beta c =0.9887 * 3e8 m/s. So, exactly as before. So precise steps.

Wait, shouldn't velocity be beta c?

Yes. Then time in lab frame is gamma tau.

Hence, L = beta c gamma tau. Therefore, equals 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Hmm. Let's compute that.

Multiplying:

beta c= 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

gamma ≈6.6667.

tau=2.056875e-24 s.

Therefore:

radius is 2.9661e8 m/s *6.6667 ≈1.977e9 *2.056875e-24 s

Wait Wait, the unit the product is m/s multiplied by s: m/s * s = m.

Compute coefficient:

beta c gamma tau = (2.9661e8 m/s) * (6.6667) * (2.056875e-24 s)

First multiply 2.9661e8 *6.6667:

2.9661e8 *6 =1.77966e9, 2.9661e8 *0.6667≈1.976e8. Total≈1.77966e9 + 1.976e8 ≈1.977e9.

Then multiply this by 2.056875e-24: 1.977e9 *2.056875e-24 ≈4.068e-15 meters. Which is ~4.07 femtometers. So, same as before.

Therefore, approximately 4.07e-15 meters. So about 4 fermis. Considering nuclear sizes are on the order of femtometers, this makes sense. Therefore, the resonant particle decays pretty much immediately upon production; such particles can't be observed as free particles traversing a detector, only inferred from their decay products.

Hmm. So is this right? A resonance like the X here has a very short lifetime, hence its decay distance is subnuclear? So in that case, yes, but maybe I made an error in unit conversions?

Let me double-check the τ calculation.

Γ = 320 MeV. Convert to GeV: 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s (converted from 6.582e-25 GeV·s; note that 1 eV·s = 1.6e-19 GeV·s? Wait no.

Wait, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So, converting 6.582e-25 GeV·s to eV·s would be 6.582e-25 * 1e9 = 6.582e-16 eV·s. Which is but here, we have Gamma in GeV, so Tau =  ħ (in GeV·s) divided by Gamma (in GeV), gives tau in seconds." Exactly. So precision.

So ħ in Plank constant is 6.62607015e-34 J·s, and using unit conversions.

Alternatively, since 1 J = 6.242e18 eV, then 6.626e-34 J·s =6.626e-34 *6.242e18 eV·s≈4.1357e-15 eV·s. So  converted to eV·s, ħ≈4.1357e-15 eV·s. Divided by for GeV·s- different factors. Dividing by 1e9 gives 4.1357e-24 GeV·s. Wait that conflicts with previous.

Wait, it's clearer: We have a Gamma value in GeV. So with h bar ~6.582e-25 GeV·s, which is the commonly cited value. Let me check, proper.

Yes, indeed, h bar c ≈197.33 MeV·fm. Therefore, computing hbar with hbar=6.582e-25 GeV·s. Yes, hence in natural units (GeV and inverse GeV), gamma is in GeV, hence using this value, tau would be (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) =2.056875e-24 seconds. This check holds. So timestamp is correct.

Thus, the calculation seems correct time, then multiplied by speed and gamma. Except that requires that

TrueParhaps then, the conclusion is that the meson resonance X has a mean decay distance of approximately 4.07 femtometers, or 4.07e-15 meters. Which indeed corroborates its characterization as a very short-lived resonance. Thus, process complete.

But let me remember the attributes: Production energy is 8 GeV, mass 1.2 GeV with width 320 MeV. The key steps:

1. Calculate mean lifetime (tau= hbar/Gamma).
2. Compute gamma (E/m).
3. Compute beta (sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2)) or via p/E.
4. Multiply all three: Beta * gamma * c * tau.

HBS using units appropriately. So L=beta*gamma*c*tau.

Since this enters in meter per second, per second, etc., the cross multiplication yields meters.

Yes. Answer is ~4.07e-15 m. Just for argument's sake, particle data groups mention that particles with lifetimes around 1e-24 seconds have decay lengths of around ((gamma beta c tau )) gamma beta 。

Suppose tau is 1e-24, gamma beta is 10; that gives 1e-24 *3e8=3e-16 times gamma beta, say maybe matching the 4e-15.**

Yes, so the math seems correct, so unless there is a missing aspect.

Wait, is the X meson moving at that energy in the lab frame? Or are we assuming it's produced at rest? if produced at rest, the velocity beta=0, hence decay length zero. But typically, in a collider or fixed-target experiment, the particles are created moving. if produced with energy 8 GeV (but the problem states production energy E_X=8 GeV, given as energy. So the rest mass is 1.2 GeV, so 8 GeV is the total energy. Thus, the analysis as done naturally.

Yes, the step is correct. Hence replacing uncertainty principle for free particle, or detector would measure. So the expected mean decay distance is about 4.07 femtometers, c's.

But I was quoting the mean decay distance as c*tau would be negligible for non-relativistic speeds, but for GeV-scale particles, speeds approach speed of light. So even with short lifetimes, the gamma factor can boost the decay length. But in this instance, Gamma of 320 MeV is large, leading to small tau, and even with gamma factor of 6.666, the product leads to a tiny, subnuclear decay length. Hence Also resonance. Good.

Thus, I think given all these steps, even though the numerical value is very small (~4 femtometers), the computation confirms this. So unless there's a mistake in formulae or application, this is the result.

**Final Answer**
The mean decay distance is \boxed{4.1 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}}.
