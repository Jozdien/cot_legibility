To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify Hydrocarbon Z**:
   - Z is formed by hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y and does not react further with hydrogen. 
   - Z has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%. Calculating the empirical formula:
     - Mass ratio of C:H is 85.72:14.28.
     - Moles of C: \( \frac{85.72}{12} \approx 7.14 \)
     - Moles of H: \( 14.28 \)
     - Ratio: \( \frac{7.14}{7.14} : \frac{14.28}{7.14} = 1:2 \)
     - Empirical formula: \( \text{CH}_2 \)
     - Molecular formula for an alkane would be \( \text{C}_n\text{H}_{2n} \). For cyclohexane (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} \)), hydrogen mass fraction is \( \frac{12}{84} = 14.28\% \). Hence, Z is cyclohexane.

2. **Determine Mixtures X and Y**:
   - **Mixture X** contains two unsaturated compounds (decolorize bromine water) that hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane).
   - **Mixture Y** (products of X's disproportionation) contains Z (cyclohexane) and another compound that hydrogenates to Z. This compound is benzene (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 \)), which hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

3. **Disproportionation Reaction**:
   - X undergoes disproportionation with Pt to form Y. This implies one component loses hydrogen (forming benzene) and another gains hydrogen (forming cyclohexane).
   - For example, cyclohexyne (\(\text{C}_6\text{H}_8\)) and cyclohexene (\(\text{C}_6\text{H}_{10}\)) could disproportionate:
     - Cyclohexyne (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_8 \)) dehydrogenates to benzene (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_6 \)).
     - Cyclohexene (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10} \)) hydrogenates to cyclohexane (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} \)).

4. ** Hydrogen Count in Mixture X**:
   - Components of X are cyclohexyne (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_8 \)) and cyclohexene (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10} \)).
   - Total hydrogen atoms in the two liquids: \( 8 + 10 = 18 \).

**Answer**: The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is \(\boxed{18}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, that probably means they have some kind of unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, because those react with bromine. The problem also says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So maybe each molecule has isolated double or triple bonds?

Then, heating mixture X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction, forming another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids. These don't decolorize bromine water anymore, so maybe Y consists of saturated compounds (alkanes) and something else? Disproportionation reactions often involve a species being both oxidized and reduced. For example, maybe in the presence of a catalyst, some hydrogen is transferred between molecules.

Hydrogenation of both mixture X and Y under severe conditions gives only one hydrocarbon Z. So whatever is in X and Y, when fully hydrogenated, they become the same product Z. Also, Z is a component of mixture Y. And Z contains 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let me calculate the empirical formula for Z.

Mass percent of H is 14.28%, so carbon is 85.72%. Let's assume 100g. Then, moles of H: 14.28g / 1g/mol = 14.28 mol. Moles of C: 85.72g / 12g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol. Divide by smallest to get the ratio: C:H ≈ 7.14 :14.28 ~ 1 : 2, so the empirical formula is CH2. But that would mean the molecular formula is (CH2)n. For alkanes, it's CnH2n+2, but here hydrogen is 2n... Wait, but maybe Z is cyclohexane? Since it's a common solvent. Let's check:

Cyclohexane is C6H12. Let's check the mass percent of H: (12*1)/(84 +12) = 12/96 = 12.5% Hmm, not 14.28%. Let's compute 14.28% in, say, benzene. No because benzene is C6H6. Mass % H: 6/(72+6) = 6/78 ≈7.69% which is lower. Wait, 14.28% might be something like cyclohexane might not be. Alternatively, say it's hexane: C6H14. Hydrogen %: 14/(72+14)=14/86 ≈16.28%, which is higher. Wait 14.28 is exactly 1/7, right? 14.28% ≈ 1/7 so the total mass is 100g, so 1g H is 1 mol, 7.14g is maybe corrections? Let's try to get the molecular formula properly.

Let’s denote (mass H) / (total mass) = 14.28% So,

Mass H / (Mass C + Mass H) = 0.1428

Let’s denote hydrogen numbers. Suppose the formula is CxHy. Then,

(y*1) / (12x + y*1) ) = 14.28/100 ≈ 1/7. So,

y/(12x + y) = 1/7

Multiply both sides by denominator:

7y = 12x + y

Subtract y:

6y = 12x => y = 2x

Therefore, the formula is CxH2x. Wait, this suggests that cyclohexane (C6H12) would have y=12 and x=6, indeed 2x=12. So cyclohexane. But earlier calculation gave H% as (12)/(84+12)=12/96=12.5%, which isn't 14.28. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the formula were C3H6. Then, H% is 6/(36+6)=6/42=14.28%. Yes! 14.28% exactly. Omg, okay. So hydrocarbon Z is propene? No. Propene is C3H6, but Z is the hydrogenation product which doesn't react further. So Z must be a cycloalkane maybe. Wait.

Wait, hydrogenation of mixture X and Y gives Z. If Z is a constituent of Y (and Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so saturated compounds). Also, Z is a solvent. Cyclopropane is not common as a solvent. Wait, cyclopropane is cyclo-C3H6. But maybe like propane? No, propane is C3H8, which would be H% 8/(44) ~ 18%. But perhaps Z is cyclopropane? Let me check hydrogenation again.

If X contains, say, propyne and propadiene... No, but X is two liquids. Wait, equimolar mixtures. Let me think.

Since hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. Means that X contains two unsaturated compounds that, when fully hydrogenated, become Z, while Y contains Z and another compound that when hydrogenated also becomes Z. Wait. So, mixture Y has two liquids: one is Z (saturated) and another must be a compound that gets hydrogenated to become Z, which suggests that compound is more unsaturated than Z.

But Z is C3H6. So, its fully hydrogenated form? No, Z is supposed not to react further with hydrogen. So Z must be an alkane. Wait, but C3H6 is propene (alkene) if it's a straight chain. But alkenes can take more hydrogen? If Z is an alkane, the only way that it won’t react with hydrogen is if it's already fully saturated. But that would require formula CnH2n+2. So C3H8. But C3H8’s hydrogen percentage is (8)/(44) ~18.18%, not 14.28.

Wait, something's wrong. Let me go back.

Hydrocarbon Z is obtained after hydrogenation, doesn't react further, so Z is an alkane. However, its mass percentage is 14.28% H. Let me recalculate: The mass fraction is H = 14.28% => Let's suppose the molecular formula is CmHn. Then, (n * 1)/(12m + n) = 14.28/100.

Which is approximately n/(12m + n) ≈ 1/7. This gives 7n ≈12m + n → 6n ≈12m → n ≈2m.

So the molecular formula is CmH2m. But for alkanes, the formula is CmH2m+2. So hmm, maybe cyclic alkane? Because cycloalkanes are CnH2n. So, if Z is cyclohexane, then C6H12, which would have H% is 12/(72+12) =1/7 ≈14.28%. Exactly! Let me check: For cyclohexane, C6H12:

Hydrogen mass: 12 *1 =12g.

Carbon mass:6*12=72g.

Total mass:84g. H% =12/84 ≈14.2857%. Which is the required percentage. Okay, so Z is cyclohexane.

Therefore, since Z is obtained by hydrogenation of X and Y. So when they hydrogenate mixture X (the unsaturated compounds), they get cyclohexane, and likewise for mixture Y. Also, Z is a component of mixture Y. So Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and something else that when hydrogenated becomes cyclohexane.

Hmm.

Wait, process: when X is treated with Pt and heated, they undergo disproportionation into Y. X is two unsaturated compounds (since they decolorize bromine) that when hydrogenated make cyclohexane. So maybe they are cyclohexene and cyclohexane? Wait, but X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated compounds that mutually disproportionate?

Wait, let's backtrack.

First, X decolorizes bromine. So could be two different alkenes, or alkynes, etc. They are not conjugated (since there are no conjugated multiple bonds). Then Pt is used for heating: when heated with Pt (a catalyst for dehydrogenation?), a disproportionation occurs. Disproportionation typically involves a substance acting as both oxidizing and reducing agent. For example, in the case of alkenes, maybe some alkane and some more unsaturated compound?

Wait, the reaction of X with Pt leads to Y which doesn't decolorize bromine. So maybe Y has saturated compounds.

Wait, perhaps X is cyclohexene and some other diene, but non-conjugated. But not sure.

Alternatively, if Y is a mixture like benzene and cyclohexane? But benzene would react with bromine under certain conditions, so maybe not.

Wait, but Y does not decolorize bromine water, so Y is two saturated compounds, as bromine doesn't react with alkanes normally. So Y could be cyclohexane (Z) plus another alkane? But hydrogenating Y would turn both components into Z.

Wait, no. If Y is two alkanes, S and Z, then hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. But the problem states hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. So Y must consist of Z and something else that hydrogenates to Z. The something else must be more unsaturated than Z. Then Y is mixture of Z and a more unsaturated compound, which upon hydrogenation becomes Z.

But given that Z is cyclohexane (C6H12?), the other component in Y must hydrogenate to C6H12. But also, Z is a constituent of Y. So maybe Y is benzene and cyclohexane? Wait, benzene. Benzene when hydrogenated would become cyclohexane. And cyclohexane in Y would stay the same. So hydrogenation of Y (equimolar benzene and cyclohexane) under severe conditions would convert benzene to cyclohexane and leave cyclohexane as is. So the end product is only cyclohexane (Z).

Therefore, hydrogenation of Y gives Z, which is cyclohexane. But what's X? X is the starting material. If X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids (which decolorize bromine water) that under Pt heating disproportionates to Y (benzene and cyclohexane).

If so, then when X (maybe cyclohexene and another related compound) is hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane (Z).

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and some other cycloalkene. Wait, cyclohexene will decolorize bromine. There's another one which upon hydrogenation, along with cyclohexene, would both become cyclohexane. Hmm.

Alternatively, the problem mentions that X is equimolar mixture of two liquids which after hydrogenation gives only Z. So X must be two different unsaturated compounds that, when fully saturated, give Z. Moreover, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it disproportionates into Y, an equimolar mixture of two liquids. Since Pt is used here, perhaps it's a catalyst for dehydrogenation? Disproportionation could imply that. But if starting from cyclohexene (for example), perhaps dehydrogenation to something else? But how?

Alternatively, maybe if X is cyclohexane and benzene. But no, they would not decolorize bromine. Probably not...

Wait, maybe starting again:

Z is cyclohexane (C6H12, or maybe that's incorrect if our first assumption is wrong). Z cannot react further, so must be an alkane?

Wait, no. Wait. If Z cannot react further with hydrogen, that means Z must indeed be fully saturated. So perhaps benzene (but H% not matching), or cyclohexane? For cyclohexane, it's a cycloalkane (six carbons, so single bonds). But cyclohexane is C6H12; mass percent H must be 12/(72 +12)=12/84≈14.28%! Yes, so that's correct. So Z is cyclohexane.

Thus, Y is a mixture of two components; one component is Z (cyclohexane) and another component which, when hydrogenated, becomes Z. So the second component in Y must be benzene. Because benzene with formula C6H6, when fully hydrogenated produces cyclohexane (C6H12). And Y is an equimolar mixture of benzene and cyclohexane. But benzene decolorizes bromine under some conditions (if using a catalyst), but Y is supposed to not decolorize bromine. 

Wait. No, benzene doesn't react with bromine water unless there's a catalyst like FeBr3 (electrophilic substitution), so under normal bromine water, benzene doesn't decolorize it, which aligns with mixture Y. So Y is cyclohexane and benzene, both of which don't decolorize bromine water without a catalyst. Makes sense. So hydrogenation of Y as benzene and cyclohexane (when hydrogenated), benzene becomes cyclohexane, and cyclohexane stays, but under "rather severe conditions," maybe benzene is completely hydrogenated. In the problem statement, it says hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z. If Z is cyclohexane, then yes, hydrogenating benzene (which is in Y) gives cyclohexane, and hydrogenating cyclohexane does nothing. But then X must be a mixture of two unsaturated compounds which hydrogenate to cycloC6H12.

But X is a mixture which decolorizes bromine. So the two components must be unsaturated.

Therefore, X could be cyclohexene (another unsaturated compound) which when hydrogenated becomes cyclohexane. But according to the first part, when mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, undergoes disproportionation to form Y (benzene and cyclohexane).

How does cyclohexene disproportionate into benzene and cyclohexane? Hmm. For example, cyclohexene could dehydrogenate to benzene and hydrogen, but by itself. Maybe under Pt, maybe three cyclohexene molecules would undergoes another process. Wait. Disproportionation would require that two molecules of a compound transform into different compounds with higher and lower H content.

If we have cyclohexene (C6H10) disproportionating under heat and Pt into benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (C6H12). Let me check:

Two moles of cyclohexene (C6H10): that totals to C12H20 → producing two products in equimolar amounts (Y is equimolar mixture). So if starting with two C6H10 molecules, we produce one C6H6 and one C6H14 (but cycloalkane is C6H12, not C6H14). Ah, perhaps different reaction. Let's balance the H:

Suppose:

C6H10 → C6H6 + C6H14

H balancing: Left side 10 H per mole ×1 mole. Right side: 6 (from benzene) + 14 (from hexane) =20. So two moles of cyclohexene → turns into 1 mole C6H6 + 1 mole C6H14? That would double:

3 cyclohexene → C6H6 + 2 C6H12 (cyclohexane) ?

Not sure. Perhaps the heat and Pt induce dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene and hydrogen, and some hydrogenation to cyclohexane? Because on the same catalyst, maybe? Platinum could catalyze both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation? If so, then:

Some cyclohexene (X maybe) is dehydrogenated to benzene (losing H2) and another part is hydrogenated to cyclohexane (needing more H2). But if that's the case, it's a disproportionation where cyclohexene both loses and gains hydrogen. So:

2 C6H10 → C6H6 + C6H14 (but cyclohexane is C6H12. So, miscalculation. Wait what's cyclohexane'd structure. Maybe:

C6H10 → C6H8 (e.g., cyclohexadiene) + H2, but would need another pathway. Maybe Equation like:

3 C6H10 → C6H6 + 2 C6H12.

Hmm. Let's balance for H. 3*10=30 H.

On RHS: C6H6 has 6 H, 2*C6H12 has 24 H. So total 30. Then it's balanced. C is 6*3=18=6 + 2*6=18. So balanced. So yes. Three moles of cyclohexene (X)—but mixture X is with another compound. Wait, equimolar two liquid mixture X. So X cannot just be cyclohexene, we need two different compounds. Then perhaps X might contain two different cycloalkenes. For example, cyclohexene (C6H10) and another cycloalkene, which upon hydrogenation, also gives cyclohexane. But then the product of their hydrogenation would still give Z, cyclohexane.

Alternatively, X might be cyclohexene (C6H10? Actually, cyclohexene is C6H10, but actually cyclohexene is C6H10, compared to cyclohexane C6H12. So comparing:

Cyclohexane (C6H12: single bonds)

Cyclohexene (C6H10: one double bond)

Cyclohexadiene (C6H8: two double bonds, non-conjugated as per the problem statement)

Benzene (C6H6: three double bonds)

But in the problem statement, X has no conjugated multiple bonds. So Cyclohexadiene with isolated double bonds exists? Maybe if the two double bonds are not conjugated—so separate places in the ring.

But the problem says that the molecules in X do not have conjugated multiple bonds. So perhaps X is a diene and an alkene. Wait, but making sure they have isolated double bonds.

Alternatively, X could be cyclohexene and another alkene. Wait, but if X is Cyclohexene and cyclooctene, but hydrogenation would both form cyclohexane and cyclooctane. No, but Z is only one substance, cyclohexane, so maybe that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, let's think of X as being two different isomeric cyclohexenes (but perhaps with different structures), but upon hydrogenation, both become cyclohexane. So for example, 1,2-cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexene. But are those possible? Cyclohexene would more likely have a single double bond regardless of position, but I'm not sure if different positions would actually exist (strain etc.); but maybe not so. Alternatively, but Perhaps X isn’t cyclic. Let's try alternative approach.

If hydrogenating both mixtures gives the same product, which is cyclohexane, then perhaps X consists of straight-chain unsaturated hydrocarbons. Let's suppose X is a mixture of 1-hexene and 1,5-hexadiene. But when hydrogenated, hydrogenation would add H across all double bonds. But 1-hexene hydrogenated to hexane. 1,5-hexadiene would also hydrogenate to hexane. Therefore, hydrogenation of X would be hexane. But Z is supposed to be cyclohexane. So cont panic.

Hmm. Alternatively, X is cyclic. Pt-catalyzed heating of X (a mixture of cyclohexene and maybe bicyclic compounds) converts to Y (benzene and cyclohexane via disproportionation).

Let's maybe recognize another angle: Since the problem mentions that Z is a constituent of Y (which is formed by disproportionation of X) and widely used as a solvent. Which substance is that? If benzene is part of Y, but historically benzene was used as a solvent (though less now due to toxicity). Cyclohexane is also used as a solvent. Yes and cyclohexane is less toxic. So the problem says Z is a constituent of Y and widely used as a solvent. Likely Z is cyclohexane.

So, hydrogenation of Y (benzene and cyclohexane) under severe conditions would hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane. Then total Z (cyclohexane). While hydrogenation of X (the original mixture), which must convert the two components into cyclohexane.

How is X formed? X decolorized bromine, so must have double bonds or triple bonds. So reacting with bromine. X is a mixture of two unsaturated hydrocarbons. Upon heating with platinum, they undergo disproportionation to a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane (Y). So what is key is that coupling—for two substances to, under Pt, undergo reactions that lead to the products in Y.

Possibly, X could be a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated, but but actually 1,3 in a ring may actually lead to conjugation unless it's something else). Wait, actually, Hmm, but the no conjugated bonds means no conjugated systems. So each molecule in X has no conjugated double bonds. So if one component is 1,4-cyclohexadiene and another is lower. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, suppose X is a mixture of some diene and alkyne. Let me think:

For the process of Disproportionation... For alkenes, through a combination of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Alternatively, using alphatic compounds.

Alternatively, suppose:

Imagine X is composed of cis and trans isomers of 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene. But no, that might not easily disproportionate. Alternatively, considering non-cyclic alkenes. For example, if you take o-Xylene or similar, but not sure.

Wait, X being two liquids which when hydrogenated (if said hydrogenated under severe conditions) become cyclohexane (possibly a six-carbon chain?), but cyclohexane is cyclic. Alternatively, another approach: consider that perhaps Z is cyclohexane, but perhaps the starting mixture X is cyclohexylenes. for example, cyclohexane may be obtained by hydrogenation of cyclohexene and benzene?

Wait, example reaction:

If X is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8) (although cyclohexyne is maybe unstable). Then, hydrogenating each would lead to cyclohexane. But thermo of cyclohexyne being part of X is unclear.

But also, so when X is heated with Pt, they undergo disproprtionation. Disproportionation of cyclohexene and cyclohexyne would likely give H shift?

Alternatively, perhaps X is cyclohexane andor cycloheXible soveletoniMolecules. But getting stuck here perhaps.

Wait another approach:

Disproportionation reaction for alkenes with Pt catalyst. In "disproportionation," also known as dehydrocyclization, commonly, we might find for instance cyclohexane dehydrocyclize to benzene and , but cyclohexane is saturated and won't get transformed. Alternatively, cyclohexene could with Pt and heat convert to benzene and hydrogen. But done in such a way that the reaction decomposes cyclohexene into benzene and another product.

Alternatively, 3 molecules of cyclohexene undergo riding I I take the reaction I formulated earlier: 3 C6H10 → C6H6 + 2 C6H12. But this suggests that three cyclohexene molecules become benzene and two cyclohexane.

But the problem states that X is equimolar mixture of two liquids which react to Y, also equimolar two liquids. So suppose X is composed of cyclohexene and benzene. But react with platinum and heat, but we need to create Y. This is getting complicated. Let's see:

Alternatively, let's search for common disproportionation reactions of alkenes with metal catalysts. For example, in the presence of palladium or platinum, alkynes can disproportionate. For alkynes, heating with a metal catalyst can form alkenes via a process called hydrogenation/dehydrogenation. For example, 2 HC≡CH → CH2=CH2 + C≡C (but maybe Sterling's process? Thermal cracking?) Alternatively, for benzene formation from steam cracking, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a cumulene and an alkene. Too ify.

Given the complexity, perhaps it's better to proceed differently. Let's recap:

After hydrogenation, Z is cyclohexane (since 14.28% H corresponds to C6H12). Therefore, hydrogenation of X yields cyclohexane.

Therefore, components of X must be dienes or alkynes. Let me test:

If X is a mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene. Then, hydrogenation would add H across all double bonds to form cyclohexane. But would they disproportionate into Y (benzene and cyclohexane). But yes, under Pt and heat, maybe:

Another mechanism could be dehydroaromatization, which converts cyclohexene, for instance, to benzene with loss of hydrogen. So, 3 cyclohexene molecules → benzene + 3 H2. Therefore, if mixture X is for example a mixture of cyclohexene (which would form benzene) and something that would pick up hydrogen (H2) to become cyclohexane.

But perhaps X has cyclohexene (C6H10) and some other diene? But X is equimolar.

Wait, perhaps X is methylcyclopentene and something else. No, getting stuck.

Alternate thought: Since Z is cyclohexane, which can be hydrogenation product from both X and Y. Y would have cyclohexane and benzene, which hydrogenates to cyclohexane. So Y being a mixture whose components do not decolorize bromine, OK. Then X must have two unsaturated forms leading to cyclohexane. So possible candidates are cyclohexene and maybe a diyne, perhaps, which under Pt allow each to fully hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Wait, a diyne would be C6H6 (since triple bonds: each triple bond reduces four hydrogens per bond). C6H6 (like hexatriyne perhaps) hydrogenated to C6H14? No, but cyclohexane(C6H12). Hmm.

Alternatively, if X has for one component cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexyne (C6H8). Hydrogenating each:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) + H2 → C6H12
Cyclohexyne (C6H8) + 3 H2 → C6H14 – but then that would conflict with Z= C6H12. Hence, not.

Alternatively, cyclohexyne becomes cyclohexane via adding two H2: C6H8 + 2 H2 → C6H12. Which fits. Then, the two components in X are C6H10 (needs one H2 to become C6H12) and C6H8 (needs two H2 to become C6H12). However, when hydrogenating them under severe conditions (which applies to both X and Y), assuming that both bonds are saturated. So maybe.

Then in mixture X, we have two compounds, molarr 1:1. such that each mole of them, when fully hydrogenated, becomes Z (each gives one mole of Z?) So if hydrogenation of X (all double or triple bonds saturated), each component, such as cyclohexene (adds two H: going from C6H10 to C6H12) or some alkyne which upon hydrogenation will also form cyclohexane (C6H12 +?)

But why HC≡C-C4H8-CH2- (some possibility). Wait. If in X you have cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1-hexyne (C6H10). If I get 1-hexyne  %C=CH2, reducing it would get hexane or cyclohexane?

Hydrogenation will depend on the type of hydrogenatioating conditions. Maybe hydrogenation under severe conditions fully hydrogenated even rings if multiple multiple bonds. Hmm.

But maybe cyclohexane’s formation requires more than straightforward addition (like ring formation). Alternatively, maybe X is bicyclic chmolécules requiring opening of rings.

But I’m not getting concrete.

Assuming that X contains cyclohexyne (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). Each would require 2 and 1 mole of H2, respectively, to turn into cyclohexane. If X is in equimolar, two different C6h8 and C6H10 when fully hydrogenated give C6H12. To that Possibly.

In any case, when X undergoes disproportionation (losing and gaining hydrogen) to form Y (benzene and cyclohexane). How? If cyclohexyne (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10) when treated with Platinum under heating, what would happen? Perhaps:

Some component undergoes dehydrogenation to become benzene (which requires loss of H), and some undergo hydrogenation to cyclohexane (gain of H). Considering C6H8 (yne) might drop more H to form benzene:

C6H8 → C6H6 + H2

And C6H10 → C6H12 (accepting H2) then, as in:

But then, each starting compound would convert, but given that the mixture is equimolar, the reaction would balance the H. For example, three molecules of C6H8 would produce three C6H6 and 3 H2. Then, three molecules of C6H10 would need H2 to become three C6H12.

If you combine, you can imagine 3 H2 (from the first) used in the second. But need an overall calculation.

Compute H:In the first part (C68→C66)：per mole, ΔH is loss of 2 H → emitting H2.

In the second part (C610+ H2→ C6^12): per mole, consume 1 H2.

So to satisfy stoichiometry:

Suppose we have a mixture of 1 mole C68 and 1 mole C6·10. 

The C68→ C66 + H2 (gives 1 H2)
The C610 + H2 → C6;12 (consumes available H2)

But is the H2 generated from dehydrogenation of C6涯 eight used for hydrogenation of C6 H10.

But here's the thing. For each mole of C6 H8, we get C6 H6 + 1 mole H2. If we have one mole from C6 H8, that H2 per mole can hydrogenate one mole of C6 H10 to cyclohexane. Therefore, reaction becomes:

C6 H8 + C6 H10 → C6 H6 + C6 H12 (requires 1 mole H2, which is provided by dominate of C6海àteen molecule.

Thus forming Y as equimolar C6H6 and C6H12—benzene and cyclohexane. Which matches the description for Y.

Therefore, X must be an equimolar mixture of cyclohexyne (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). But wait, don’t cyclohexyne and cyclohexene degrade… real compounds? Well, cyclohexyne is possible but strained. Alternatively, perhaps this is pair of substituted inline? Either way, following possibility, Let's sum.

In mixture X, we have two components:

1) A: One triple bond structure (C6H8), such as 1,3-Cyclohexyne
2) B: One double bond structure (C6H10), like cyclohexene

These hydrogenate:

1) A (with 2 H2) → C6 H12
2) B (with 1 H2) → C6 H12

Hence, upon hydrogenation of mixture X (equimolar A and B), combine for 50% mole A (using 2 H2) and 50% mole B (using 1 H2). But since both form cyclohexane, the product is all cyclohexane. Then, when mixture Y (benzene and cyclohexane) undergoes hydrogenation, the benzene+ pt severe conditions uses hydrogen to add and turn benzene (C6H6) into cyclohexane (with 3 H2), and and cyclohexane remains.

Therefore, that fits.

Going back, when mixture X (A and B) is treated with Pt and heated, undergoesd this reaction:

A (C6H8) → C6H6 + H2

B (C6H10) + H2 → C6H12

In equimolar ratio yielding Y as equimolar benzene and cyclohexane. Hence satisfying the description.

Thus, proposed components of X are cyclohexyne (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10). However, wait, but cyclohexyne's molecular formula would require an triple bond giving. Alkyne general formula CnH2n-2. So, X component A must be a cycloalkyne with C6H8.

The problem states that the molecules in X have no conjugated multiple bonds, which are satisfied if it's respectively a cycloalkyne and an cycloalkene with isolated bonds.

Therefore, each component in X would have H counts as follows:

Cyclohexyane (hypothetically C6H8): number of H atoms: 8.

Cyclohexene (C6H10): H atoms: 10.

Therefore, in each molecule:

Cyclohexyne (each molecule has 8 H)

Cyclohexene (doesCH10. Since Cyclohexane would have 12 H, cyclohexene =12-2=10.

Therefore, the two liquids in mixture X have molecular formulas C6H8 and C6H10. Total twins delta of H atoms per molecule: 8 +10=18. Hence, for two molecules in X, total H atoms:8+10=18 (each mole of each). Then the answer's desired is  the sum of H atoms in the two molecules. 8+10=18. Therefore, \boxed{18}

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, that probably means they have some kind of unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, because those react with bromine. The problem also says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So maybe each molecule has isolated double or triple bonds?

Then, heating mixture X with platinum causes a disproportionation reaction, forming another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids. These don't decolorize bromine water anymore, so maybe Y consists of saturated compounds (alkanes) and something else? Disproportionation reactions often involve a species being both oxidized and reduced. For example, maybe in the presence of a catalyst, some hydrogen is transferred between molecules.

Hydrogenation of both mixture X and Y under severe conditions gives only one hydrocarbon Z. So whatever is in X and Y, when fully hydrogenated, they become the same product Z. Also, Z is a component of mixture Y. And Z contains 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let me calculate the empirical formula for Z.

Mass percent of H is 14.28%, so carbon is 85.72%. Let's assume 100g. Then, moles of H: 14.28g / 1g/mol = 14.28 mol. Moles of C: 85.72g / 12g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol. Divide by smallest to get the ratio: C:H ≈ 7.14 :14.28 ~ 1 : 2, so the empirical formula is CH2. But that would mean the molecular formula is (CH2)n. For alkanes, it's CnH2n+2, but here hydrogen is 2n... Wait, but maybe Z is cyclohexane? Since it's a common solvent. Let's check:

Cyclohexane is C6H12. Let's check the mass percent of H: (12*1)/(84 +12) = 12/96 = 12.5% Hmm, not 14.28%. Let's compute 14.28% in, say, benzene. No because benzene is C6H6. Mass % H: 6/(72+6) = 6/78 ≈7.69% which is lower. Wait, 14.28% might be something like cyclohexane might not be. Alternatively, say it's hexane: C6H14. Hydrogen %: 14/(72+14)=14/86 ≈16.28%, which is higher. Wait 14.28 is exactly 1/7, right? 14.28% ≈ 1/7 so the total mass is 100g, so 1g H is 1 mol, 7.14g is maybe corrections? Let's try to get the molecular formula properly.

Let’s denote (mass H) / (total mass) = 14.28% So,

Mass H / (Mass C + Mass H) = 0.1428

Let’s denote hydrogen numbers. Suppose the formula is CxHy. Then,

(y*1) / (12x + y*1) ) = 14.28/100 ≈ 1/7. So,

y/(12x + y) = 1/7

Multiply both sides by denominator:

7y = 12x + y

Subtract y:

6y = 12x => y = 2x

Therefore, the formula is CxH2x. Wait, this suggests that cyclohexane (C6H12) would have y=12 and x=6, indeed 2x=12. So cyclohexane. But earlier calculation gave H% as (12)/(84+12)=12/96=12.5%, which isn't 14.28. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the formula were C3H6. Then, H% is 6/(36+6)=6/42=14.28%. Yes! 14.28% exactly. Omg, okay. So hydrocarbon Z is propene? No. Propene is C3H6, but Z is the hydrogenation product which doesn't react further. So Z must be a cycloalkane maybe. Wait.

Wait, hydrogenation of mixture X and Y gives Z. If Z is a constituent of Y (and Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so saturated compounds). Also, Z is a solvent. Cyclopropane is not common as a solvent. Wait, cyclopropane is cyclo-C3H6. But maybe like propane? No, propane is C3H8, which would be H% 8/(44) ~ 18%. But perhaps Z is cyclopropane? Let me check hydrogenation again.

If X contains, say, propyne and propadiene... No, but X is two liquids. Wait, equimolar mixtures. Let me think.

Since hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. Means that X contains two unsaturated compounds that, when fully hydrogenated, become Z, while Y contains Z and another compound that when hydrogenated also becomes Z. Wait. So, mixture Y has two liquids: one is Z (saturated) and another must be a compound that gets hydrogenated to become Z, which suggests that compound is more unsaturated than Z.

But Z is C3H6. So, its fully hydrogenated form? No, Z is supposed not to react further with hydrogen. So Z must be an alkane. Wait, but C3H6 is propene (alkene) if it's a straight chain. But alkenes can take more hydrogen? If Z is an alkane, the only way that it won’t react with hydrogen is if it's already fully saturated. But that would require formula CnH2n+2. So C3H8. But C3H8’s hydrogen percentage is (8)/(44) ~18.18%, not 14.28.

Wait, something's wrong. Let me go back.

Hydrocarbon Z is obtained after hydrogenation, doesn't react further, so Z is an alkane. However, its mass percentage is 14.28% H. Let me recalculate: The mass fraction is H = 14.28% => Let's suppose the molecular formula is CmHn. Then, (n * 1)/(12m + n) = 14.28/100.

Which is approximately n/(12m + n) ≈ 1/7. This gives 7n ≈12m + n → 6n ≈12m → n ≈2m.

So the molecular formula is CmH2m. But for alkanes, the formula is CmH2m+2. So hmm, maybe cyclic alkane? Because cycloalkanes are CnH2n. So, if Z is cyclohexane, then C6H12, which would have H% is 12/(72+12) =1/7 ≈14.28%. Exactly! Let me check: For cyclohexane, C6H12:

Hydrogen mass: 12 *1 =12g.

Carbon mass:6*12=72g.

Total mass:84g. H% =12/84 ≈14.2857%. Which is the required percentage. Okay, so Z is cyclohexane.

Therefore, since Z is obtained by hydrogenation of X and Y. So when they hydrogenate mixture X (the unsaturated compounds), they get cyclohexane, and likewise for mixture Y. Also, Z is a component of mixture Y. So Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and something else that when hydrogenated becomes cyclohexane.

Hmm.

Wait, process: when X is treated with Pt and heated, they undergo disproportionation into Y. X is two unsaturated compounds (since they decolorize bromine) that when hydrogenated make cyclohexane. So maybe they are cyclohexene and cyclohexane? Wait, but X is an equimolar mixture of two unsaturated compounds that mutually disproportionate?

Wait, let's backtrack.

First, X decolorizes bromine. So could be two different alkenes, or alkynes, etc. They are not conjugated (since there are no conjugated multiple bonds). Then Pt is used for heating: when heated with Pt (a catalyst for dehydrogenation?), a disproportionation occurs. Disproportionation typically involves a substance acting as both oxidizing and reducing agent. For example, in the case of alkenes, maybe some alkane and some more unsaturated compound?

Wait, the reaction of X with Pt leads to Y which doesn't decolorize bromine. So maybe Y has saturated compounds.

Wait, perhaps X is cyclohexene and some other diene, but non-conjugated. But not sure.

Alternatively, if Y is a mixture like benzene and cyclohexane? But benzene would react with bromine under certain conditions, so maybe not.

Wait, but Y does not decolorize bromine water, so Y is two saturated compounds, as bromine doesn't react with alkanes normally. So Y could be cyclohexane (Z) plus another alkane? But hydrogenating Y would turn bo

# Anthropic completion

Let me attempt to solve this chemistry problem by analyzing it systematically.

I'm examining an equimolar mixture X containing two liquids that decolorize bromine water. This suggests unsaturated bonds like alkenes or alkynes, which typically react with bromine. The problem mentions no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X, indicating isolated double or triple bonds in each molecule.

When mixture X is heated with platinum, a disproportionation reaction occurs, forming another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids. These no longer decolorize bromine water, potentially indicating saturated compounds. Disproportionation typically involves simultaneous oxidation and reduction of the same species - perhaps hydrogen transfer is occurring between molecules catalyzed by platinum.

Hydrogenating both mixtures X and Y under severe conditions yields only one hydrocarbon Z. This suggests that the components in both X and Y, when fully hydrogenated, produce the identical product Z. Notably, Z is already a component in mixture Y. Z contains 14.28% hydrogen by mass, so I'll calculate its empirical formula.

With hydrogen at 14.28%, carbon must be 85.72%. In a 100g sample, this gives approximately 14.28 moles of hydrogen and 7.14 moles of carbon (85.72g/12g/mol). The mole ratio of C:H is about 1:2, suggesting an empirical formula of CH₂. This means the molecular formula would be (CH₂)ₙ.

I notice 14.28% equals exactly 1/7. If we denote the formula as CₓHᵧ, then y/(12x + y) = 1/7. Solving this equation: 7y = 12x + y, which simplifies to 6y = 12x, giving y = 2x. Therefore, the formula is CₓH₂ₓ.

For a compound like cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂), hydrogen percentage would be 12/(72+12) = 12/84 = 14.28% exactly. This matches our calculation! So Z appears to be cyclohexane.

Since Z is obtained by hydrogenation of both X and Y, and Z is already a component of mixture Y, Y must be an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and another compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, suggesting it contains saturated compounds.

Perhaps X consists of two unsaturated compounds without conjugated bonds that, when heated with platinum, undergo disproportionation to form Y. The reaction with platinum likely involves hydrogen transfer, creating a mixture where one component is fully saturated (cyclohexane) and the other requires further hydrogenation to become cyclohexane.

I'm still considering what the specific components of mixtures X and Y might be, given that Y contains cyclohexane and another compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane, while X contains two unsaturated compounds that both hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

# OpenAI completion

Sure, let's approach this chemistry problem methodically. We'll dissect it gradually.

We start with an equimolar mixture X, comprised of two liquids that can decolorize bromine water, suggesting they're likely unsaturated compounds, like alkenes or alkynes, since these react with bromine. The problem indicates these compounds lack conjugated multiple bonds, so perhaps each has isolated double or triple bonds.

Heating mixture X with platinum leads to a disproportionation reaction, resulting in another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids. Since Y does not decolorize bromine water, it might consist of saturated compounds like alkanes, alongside something else. Disproportionation often means a species is both oxidized and reduced, possibly involving hydrogen transfer between molecules in the presence of a catalyst.

Upon hydrogenating both mixtures X and Y, a single hydrocarbon Z is produced. So whatever's in X and Y, when completely hydrogenated, converts to Z. Notably, Z is also a component of Y, and contains 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let's determine the empirical formula of Z:

Given the hydrogen mass percent at 14.28%, carbon must be 85.72%. Assuming a 100g sample, we calculate: Moles of H: 14.28g / 1g/mol = 14.28 mol; Moles of C: 85.72g / 12g/mol ≈ 7.14 mol. Dividing by the smallest figure yields the ratio C:H ≈ 7.14 : 14.28, which simplifies to 1:2. So, the empirical formula is CH2. This implies its molecular formula could be (CH2)n—similar to alkanes, which are CnH2n+2—though the hydrogen here is 2n. Let us consider if Z could be cyclohexane, a common solvent:

Cyclohexane is C6H12. Checking H%: (12*1)/(84 +12) = 12/96 = 12.5% doesn't match 14.28%. We calculate 14.28% for benzene, C6H6, but 6/(72+6) = 6/78 ≈ 7.69%, which is too low. Conversely, hexane, C6H14, yields hydrogen % 14/(72+14)=14/86 ≈ 16.28%, which is too high. Notably, 14.28% approximates 1/7, indicating total mass at 7.14g (possible corrections involved). Let's derive the proper molecular formula.

We set (mass H) / (total mass) = 14.28%. Denote hydrogen atoms: if formula CxHy: (y*1) / (12x + y) ≈ 1/7. Therefore:

7y = 12x + y
6y = 12x => y = 2x
The formula is CxH2x, implying cyclohexane (C6H12) has y=12 and x=6, affirming 2x=12. But prior H% was off. Conversely, C3H6’s H% is 6/(36+6)=6/42=14.28%, exactly 14.28%. Hydrocarbon Z is, therefore, C3H6. Nonetheless, as Z is the result of hydrogenating X and Y, it should not be further reactive, indicating Z might be a cycloalkane. Cyclopropane is less common as a solvent.

Reviewing again, hydrocarbon Z is achieved after hydrogenation and should not react further, indicating it's an alkane. Yet, its mass percentage is 14.28%. Recalculating:

H%: 14.28%. For CmHn: (n)/(12m + n) =14.28/100, approximating n/(12m + n) ≈ 1/7. We have 7n ≈12m + n → 6n ≈12m → n = 2m. Suggesting molecular formula CmH2m, while alkanes are CmH2m+2, indicates possible cyclic alkane formula (CnH2n).

Thus, if Z as cyclohexane is C6H12: H% is 12/(72+12) =1/7 ≈14.28%, accurately matching. For cyclohexane, C6H12:

Hydrogen mass is 12g.
Carbon mass is 72g.
Total mass 84g yields H% = 12/84 ≈14.2857%.
So, Z is cyclohexane.

Considering Z arises from X and Y hydrogenation, cyclohexane forms when fully hydrogenating X (unsaturated compounds) or Y (Y includes cyclohexane). Y implies an equimolar mix of cyclohexane and an additional compound, which upon hydrogenation also forms cyclohexane.

Reflect further: X, treated with Pt and heat, becomes Y. If X consists of two unsaturated but non-conjugated compounds, their hydrogenation yields cyclohexane. Cyclohexene and cyclohexane would not fit due to saturation disparity.

Initially, X decolorizes bromine, possibly two different alkenes/alkynes, non-conjugated. Pt catalyzes dehydrogenation leading to Y. Disproportionation typically involves an oxidizing and reducing agent; for alkenes, perhaps an alkane and a more unsaturated form? Y, not decolorizing bromine, likely holds saturated compounds.

Suppose X = cyclohexene and a non-conjugated diene. Or perhaps Y = equimolar benzene and cyclohexane? Given bromine reactivity, Y likely holds two saturated compounds, Y being a cyclohexane and another alkane.

So the other component of Y must be something that can be hydrogenated to give Z.\n\nWait, if Y is cyclohexane and another compound, say, another alkane, but hydrogenating that would have no effect. So this doesn\'t make sense. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe Y is cyclopropane and something else. But if Z is cyclohexane, then maybe that\'s not.\n\nAlternatively, hydrogenation of Y is done under "rather severe conditions". Maybe Y has some aromatic compounds. For example, Y is cyclohexane (saturated) and benzene. Benzenewouldn\'t decolorize bromine unless in the presence of a catalyst. Oh, bromine with benzene needs a Fe catalyst. Without, so benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine water. So maybe Y is cyclohexane and benzene? If you hydrogenate benzene (with severe conditions, like high pressure and temperature) to cyclohexane. But then Z, which is cyclohexane, is a component of Y. And hydrogenation of Y (both cyclohexane and benzene) would result in cyclohexane for benzene hydrogenation, and cyclohexane remains. Thus the only product is Z=cyclohexane. Then for X, mixture of? X is two liquids which decolorize bromine. Mixture X is hydrogenated to Z=cyclohexane, so initial X has two compounds which can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. What could those be? Maybe cyclohexene (a liquid?) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene. But the problem says that in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X, there are no conjugated multiple bonds. So cyclohexene (one double bond, not conjugated) and another molecule with isolated double bonds? Wait, but cyclohexadiene can\'t have conjugated bonds. No because conjugated is double bonds separated by single bonds. If cyclohexadiene with conjugated bonds aren\'t allowed, X must have two molecules with possibly non-conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe one triple bond and one double bond. \n\nBut wait, maybe X is benzene and cyclohexane? No, benzene might be in X, but X was supposed to decolorize bromine which benzene doesn\'t unless a catalyst, so maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps X is cyclohexene and another cyclohexene isomer? I\'m getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecules in X are some dienes with non-conjugated double bonds, like 1,2-diene? But that should be allenes (cumulated dienes) which might not be stable. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, X could be two different cycloalkenes. For example, cyclopentene and cycloheptene? But I don\'t think that makes sense. Also, hydrogenating cyclopentene would give cyclopentane, which is different from cyclohexane.\n\nWait, think structurally.\n\nHydrocarbon Z is cyclohexane. Which is made by fully hydrogenating X and Y. Therefore, both X and Y must be more unsaturated. When X is hydrogenated, all double bonds converted to single bonds, leading to cyclohexane. So starting from X, it\'s possible that the two liquids in X can each add hydrogen to become cyclohexane.\n\nSimilarly, Y has two compounds which, when hydrogenated (under severe conditions), gives Z (cyclohexane). But Z is already in Y, so hydrogenation won\'t affect Z. So, perhaps the other component in Y is benzene. Because benzene can be hydrogenated under severe conditions to cyclohexane, and cyclohexane remains. Therefore, Y is benzene and cyclohexane.\n\nIf that\'s the case, then when heating X (the original unsaturated mixture) with Pt (which is a catalyst for dehydrogenation, perhaps), the mixture undergoes disproportionation. Disproportionation of alkenes into alkanes and aromatic compounds? Wait, for example, suppose X is cyclohexene. Under certain conditions, two molecules could disproportionation into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene. Wait, cyclohexane is more hydrogenated, cyclohexadiene is more dehydrogenated. If that continues to form benzene... But the problem states that Y is formed via disproportionation as a result. If you start with cyclohexene and catalyst, it can disproportion to cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene? Then further reaction?\n\nBut the problem states that Y is two equimolar liquids. Let me think. If X is cyclohexene (maybe in mixture, but equimolar, but X is two compounds). Hmm.\n\nWait, original mixture X is two liquids. Maybe the two components are cis and trans isomers of cyclohexene? No, that would be stereoisomers, but the hydrogenation products would be same. Perhaps a diene and a monoene? But wait, if X\'s two liquids hydrogenated give same product. If one is cyclohexene (which hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and the other maybe... But how? Another unsaturated compound which can become cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Maybe a mono-unsaturated and a tri-unsaturated. Wait, but that doesn\'t make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the two components of X might be isomeric alkenes where hydrogenation leads to the same cyclohexane, but structural isomers. For example, 1-cyclohexene and another substituted cyclohexene. But perhaps X is a mixture of some dienes and alkenes. But in their molecules, there are no conjugated multiple bonds. So like 1,2-pentadiene and something else? I need to find the mixture X. Probably the two liquids in X are some dienes and/or alkenes which when hydrogenated give cyclohexane.\n\nAlternatively, the main thing is that there’s a disproportionation leading to benzene and cyclohexane. But to get benzene, perhaps two cyclohexene molecules disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene. Let me check.\n\nBalanced equation: 3 cyclohexene → cyclohexane + benzene. Let\'s balance: Each C6H10 → C6H12 (hydrogenation) and C6H6 (dehydrogenation). So 3 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6. The H balance? \n\n3*10=30 H on left.\n\nC6H12 (12 H) + C6H6 (6 H) → 18 H. Difference of 12 H missing. Maybe hydrogens get released?\n\nSo 3 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6 + 3 H2.\n\nBut unlikely. Alternatively, there\'s dehydrocyclization. For example, cyclohexene could be dehydrogenate to form benzene. But with platinum, probably leading to aromatic compounds.\n\nBut disproportionation implies some molecules get oxidized and others get reduced. In this case, cyclohexene (which is like partially hydrogenated compared to benzene) might lose hydrogen (oxidized to aromatic) and another gains hydrogen (reduced to cyclohexane). Therefore:\n\nIf two molecules of C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6\n\nBut then stoichiometry: 2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6. Let’s check H balance:\n\nLeft side: 2*10 =20 H. Right:12 +6=18. So missing 2 H, perhaps evolves H2 gas. The equation would be 2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6 + H2↑. However, that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtracting a different number or adding Pt as a catalyst. But the reaction needs to be in equimolar ratio for Y. Then Y would be two liquids: C6H12 and C6H6. So molecular formula cyclohexane and benzene, which are immiscible? Are both liquids? Cyclohexane is a liquid, benzene is also a liquid (boiling point ~80°C). At room temperature, they’re both liquids. So mixture Y is equimolar cyclohexane and benzene. Then X would be maybe cyclohexene and another compound which when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane.\n\nWait, but if X is a mixture of benzene and another compound, but wait the problem says X decolorizes bromine water. Benzene under normal conditions does not react with bromine without a catalyst. So if X is an equimolar mix of two substances that decolorize bromine, like cyclohexene and another alkene. Wait, then hydrogenation gives cyclohexane from both cyclohexene. But then mixture Y comes from disproportionation of X? I\'m confused.\n\nWait, process: mixing of X (two liquids which decolorize bromine) that get treated with Pt under heating. Hydrogenation of X gives Z (cyclohexane). Disproportionation yields Y, which is equimolar mixture of two liquids, which are cyclohexane and benzene. Then hydrogenating Y (benzene and cyclohexane) under severe conditions with platinum gives only cyclohexane (hydrog of benzene) cyclonexane stays. So fitting. So in that case, X would be cyclohexene? But X is a mixture of two liquids. Maybe two different cycloalkenes? Or maybe allene and cyclohexene. But with no conjugated bonds.\n\nBut the question is, once the actual structure of X is known, then they need to count the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids.\n\nIf X is mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexane? No, would that decolorize bromine water? 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated dienes, which react fast with bromine, but cyclohexane does not. Wait, but X is treated as decolorize bromine, so both components must decolorize. Therefore both unsaturated. So if X is, perhaps, the two components each have one double bond, which decolorize bromine. Treatment with Pt causes disproportionation to mixture Y consisting of Benzene (doesn\'t react) and cyclohexane (doesn\'t react) in equimolar.\n\nSo maybe X is 1,3-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene? Wait, but cyclohexene has one double bond, and 1,3-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. Wait, 1,3-cyclohexadiene would have isolated double bonds? If a molecule has two non-conjugated double bonds, like 1,3-pentadiene, those double bonds can\'t conjugate through a single bond. But wait, cyclohexadiene with 1,3-diene: in a cyclohexane ring, 1 and 3 positions aren\'t conjugated. So maybe. But the question said "there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X". So each molecule in X cannot have conjugated double bonds, but can have isolated ones.\n\nHence, X must have two compounds, each with isolated double bonds. For each molecule, maybe molecules like bicyclic compounds? Maybe considering a norbornene (bicyclic) or something.\n\nAlternatively, each component could have two non-conjugated double bonds. For example, 1,4-cyclohexadiene. Is that possible? But those molecules. Then on Pt, the dienes due to H-shifts can lead to benzene and to cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps each molecule of X could be (a diene and an mono-ene).\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me try thinking again.\n\nIf Z is cyclohexane, probably C6H12. X, upon hydrogenation, forms Z ≥ X consists of compounds which when hydrogenated becomes Z, but the compounds themselves have double bonds.\n\nSo possible components of X could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Then treatment with Pt under heat leads to their disproportionation into Y: cyclohexane and benzene (C6H6). But both cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)—let me check stoichiometry.\n\nTaking two molecules of cyclohexene (C6H10) → taking one that gains H2 (to become cyclohexane) and one that loses H2 (to become benzene). For a cyclohexene to cyclohexane: add H2. For cyclohexene to benzene: lose 4 H2? C6H10 + ? To form C6H6 requires loss of 4 H. Since cyclohexene -> benzene would be 3 H2 molecules lost.\n\nWait, benzene has formula C6H6. So cyclohexene (which is C6H10 vs benzene C6H6). To go from cyclohexene to benzene: need to lose 4 H2 (since 10-6=4 H atoms, which is 2 H2).\n\nBut for disproportionation, suppose two cyclohexene molecules (X) transforming into cyclohexane and benzene. Two C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6. Let\'s check H: 2*10 =20. Right:12 +6=18. So need to lose 2 H, likely H2 gas.\n\nThen Pt-catalyzed reaction:\n\n2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6 + H2\n\nBut then same when? But then mechanism here.\n\nBut, and mixture X contains perhaps two different dienes: but considering original X is equimolar mixture. If the above reaction requires two C6H10 molecules to make products in equimolar Y. Wait, how does this lead to equimolar Y. Let me see. In the reaction:\n\n2 C6H10 → C6H12 (cyclo) + C6H6 (benzene) + H2. So if X is composed of molecules C6H10 (cyclohexene), then when two molecules react, you get one cyclo and one benzene, but probably each step would release hydrogen gas. Then, the mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Hence, from two moles of X (cyclohexene), you get one mole each cyclohexane and benzene + H2. However, X was an equimolar mixture of two compounds, so perhaps X is composed of cyclohexene and another compound? The problem says Y is formed as a result of disproportionation of X+Pt/Heat. So perhaps X contains two unsaturated compounds that engage in the dispropotionation. \n\nAlternatively, think of feeding only one component through (say cyclohexene). Then on Pt, cyclohexene disproportionates into cyclohexane and benzene, they collect in equimolar amounts, hence two components Y. But original X was pure cyclohexene which is a single component. However, the problem states X is a mixture of two. There must be two different components that X consists of. So perhaps benzoic structure or other. \n\nAlternatively, notes:\n\nIf X is acetylene (but that\'s a gas) – maybe cyclohexyne? Not likely. Wait, no. Consider more carefully example. Let me look.\n\nWait, the original reaction:\n\nAn equimolar mixture X (two liquids) which decolorize bromine (so alkenes or alkynes) treated with Pt when heated becomes mixture Y of two liquids, also equimolar, that don\'t decolorize bromine. When both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they give Z, which is in Y. Z is cyclohexane.\n\nBy X and Y hydrogenilly converted totally into Z (cyclohexane), so X and Y must consist of compounds that have more unsaturation, like mono-enes and maybe benzene (which needs hydrogenation).\n\nBut Hydrogenation under severe conditions (Y consists of cyclohexane. Which remains unchanged, and some aromatic compounds, like benzene, which will be hydrogenated to cyclohexane). Meanwhile, X consists of dienes and enes.\n\nAssume; Pt is using as a catalyst for such reactions.\n\nKey insight: The initial mixture X upon heating with Pt gives Y through disproportionation. That reaction converts two starting material molecules (equimolar mix) into two products (equimolar mix). So need stoichiometrically may couple between reactant ratio.\n\nSuppose X has two components, A and B. Then on Pt, those disproportionate to yield Y which includes Z (cyclohexane). Perhaps A and B transfer hydrogen:\n\nA→ becomes something more hydrogenated (cyclohexane) and B → less hydrogenated (benzene). So equation. Thus: A + B → cyclohexane + benzene. But if X is equimolar in A and B, then Y is equimolar. \n\nTherefore, problem: What kind of reaction can split two different precursor molecules into cyclohexane and benzene. Key is checking hydrogenation.\n\nAssuming A and B are different in their degrees of unsaturation, but once hydrogenated become Cyclohexane.\n\nSuppose Y is Both cyclohexane and benzene (1:1)\n\nHydrogenated,\n\nCyclohexane stays same, benzene becomes cyclohexane. Hence Z is formed.\n\nWhat starting materials would hydrogenate to cyclo hexane?\n\nPossibly:\n\nA is cyclohexene (C6H10), which hydrogenate to C6H12; Benzene would require that A could something else?\n\nWait, other option:\n\nThink former finds aren\'t leading. Let\'s think of the hydrogens: reactant X when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane from both liquids. Y is an equimolar mixture of those two and Y (which has cyclohexane and benzene character), so one component in Y is already Z.\n\nWait Cyclohexane (Z) is inert. The other in Y when hydrogenated (i.e., benzene) becomes cyclohexane. Therefore, the two components in X each need, when hydrogenated, to become cyclohexane. So X is a mixture of 1) a compound that when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane and 2) cyclohexane.\n\nWait, no, cannot be—because cyclohexane already is alkanes. But when treated with Pt and heated, X converts to Y through disproportionation.\n\nWait, the problem states X is being treated with platinum (catalyst) when heated to form Y. So the A and B of X, which are both unsaturated.\n\nSo, assuming that each component of X is almost done that upon hydrogenation they give Z (cyclohexane). Then components must be isomeric with respect to each other. For example, as cyclohexene (C6H10) and another cyclohexene with a different substituent, but same product after hydrogenation.\n\nAlternatively, each component can hydrogenate to cyclohexane, but both start from a different position.\n\nBut after Pt and heat, they might have two compounds in Y. Let’s look for known disproportionation reactions involving alkenes with Pt.\n\nAlternatively, the components might be butadiene derivatives. No, but then hydrogenation would give mixturbation products.\n\nWait, another approach: since Z is C6H12. To hydrogenate either X or Y gives Z. When X will have compounds which when hydrogenated gives Z. So each compound in X must add H2 rings. Then Х could consist of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8): both would add hydrogen to produce C6H12. When you hydrogenated both in X, they become cyclohexane. The yield of Z is pure cyclohexane.\n\nPlatinum on heating with X (the mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene) leads to disproportionation. How?? Well, maybe cyclohexene oxidizes and reduces. If cyclohexene (C6H10) can perform a formal loss and gain of hydrogen. For instance:\n\n one cyclohexene molecule gains H2 (to form cyclohexane C6H12), while another loses H2 (to form C6H8, cyclohexadiène). If you have properly mixed different ratios. But original X is mix of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene). Maybe ammonia DE?\n\nWait, I don\'t think platinum usually causes addition or abstraction of hydrogen. Maybe-\n\nHold on, perhaps the reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene in presence of platinum can trimerize??? Not likely. Or the actual process with platinum as a catalyst causes dehydroaromatization. - Equimolar mix Y is benzene and cyclohexane. The way to form benzene could be via diene to aromatic。\n\nIf you take a molecule with three Double bonds, maybe, but cyclohexene cannot directly form benzene. Think about cyclohexane到苯的结构变化。\n\nIf we have, say, 1,3-cyclohexadiene heating with platinum. Maybe cyclohexadiene induces, with catalyst, the loss of hydrogen gas to form benzene. But maybe: If X has two components, both of which can lose or gain hydrogen.\n\nWait, yes. Suppose the two components are 1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene. Then, 1C6H8 and 1C6H10.\n\nUnder Pt, the C6H10 could lose H2, converting to C6H8; and the C6H8 loses more H2 to form benzene. While another possibility for  maybe re-shuffling.\n\nSo equimolar mixture Y would thus have benzene (from dienes via Pt dehydrogenation) and cyclohexane (from undergoing hydrogenation via Pt). But Pt as a catalyst—diagram this:\n\nFor example, think:\n\nC6H10 (cyclohexene) → if cyclohexene is hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. But why would Pt (which is a hydrogenation catalyst) need hydrogen? Wait, but in the initial problem statement, when X is treated with Platinum when heated, they form Y. So maybe heat and Pt in absence of additional hydrogen leads to different process. Dehydrogenation, perhaps.\n\nAh, important: When X is treated with Platinum when heated, which causes disproportionation. So it\'s a dehydrogenation reaction. Since Pt is a metal catalyst, that facilitates the removal of hydrogen as H2. For example, in processes like the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes, aromatization (forming benzene).\n\nSo suppose mixture X is a mix of liquids which are (1,3-cyclohexadiene and another compound). Wait when heated over Pt (dehydrogenation conditions). 1,3-cyclohexadiene could lose H2 and form benzene. But then maybe reaction of:\n\n3 C6H8 → C6H6 + 2 C6H9 (?)\n\nWait this is getting complicate. Another thought: Suppose each molecule in X, when Dehydrogenized will lose hydrogen. But if it\'s an equimolar mix, the average hydrogen loss (redistribution) could create elements in Y that are cyclohexane and benzene.\n\nWait, reconsider\n\nHydrogenation converts all the multiple down to saturate.\n\nNit. Think the key may be that the compounds in X are cyclohexene and benzenece前生体.\n\nScratch that. While struggling to find the answer, perhaps I should find out where to find the compounds involved.\n\nSince Z is cyclohexane used as a solvent. Z is a component of Y. Y is mixture of two liquids: cyclohexane and benzene. X is hydrogenated specifically to cyclohexane.\n\nThus, when X is treated with platinum and heat, which prompts dehydrogenation of some molecules and deuteration possibly of others. Wait, maybe another term is dehydrocyclization.\n\nFor example:\n\n3 cyclohexene → benzene + 3 H2.\n\nBut apportionment not a equimolar mixture. Alternatively, if X comprises cyclohexene        ?\n\nWait, or another scenario:\n\nIf X is a mixture of 1,3-pentadiene and ? No that might not cyclo any.\n\nAlternatively, X is vinyl cyclohexene. for after hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.\n\nAlternatively, think another way—because in the end, we need to count the number of hydrogen in the liquid components of X. Maybe it\'s about going to the problem step-by-step:\n\nZ has massthess H 14.28% iscyclohexane (C6H12).\n\nHydrogenation of X (where X is two compounds A and B) gives cyclohexane.\n\nThus, both A and B must have the same number of carbons as Z and addn of hydrogen will surpassi ng.\n\nSo number of carbons in A and B would be 6, because Z has 6.\n\nImagine A is a cyclohexene (C6H10) and B is something else with 6 carbons and which adds H2 into C6H12. Such as a Cyclohexa-diene (C6H8).\n\nBut mix of hexene and hexadienewhich mixes®.\n\nThus, cyclohexene has 10 H，hexadiene has 8 H。mix equimolar, the total Hs per two molecules is 10 + 8 = 18. Queried question: What\'s the total number of H atoms in two liquids of X.\n\nIf the components are cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene, then total H in X would be (10 +8)=18. Thus 18 total H atoms in the two molecules. So answer: \\boxed{18}\n\nBut we need verify structure matches all conditions. All conditions:\n\n1. X is mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene (each liquid hydrocarbons), which decolorizes bromine. Each has isolated double bonds (1双键和2 isolated双健) ensuring no conjugation.\n\n2.  treatments with Pt heat (dehydrogenation?) leads to disproportionation to cyclohexane and benzene.\n\nBut wait, if X is cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene, how would Pt and heat towers convert them to Y (cyclohexane and benzene). For example, each Cyclohexene could hydrogenate to cyclohexane in presence of H2. Or, need H2?\n\nProcess:\n\nWhen Pt is used with heat, in the absence of H2 should it driving Diels-Alder reaction or dehydrogenation.\n\nAssuming it\'s a dehydrogenation setting, possibly catalyzing the formation of benzene.\n\nBut for example, stoichiometry of  cyclohexen ↑+ cyclohexadiene undergoing reaction to cyclohexane + benzene?\n\nPossible: cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8) interconnect to form CH2 components.\n\nBut total Carbon in Y? Okay,Y comprises two components: cyclohexan (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). Which accounts for all six chloro rings.\n\nBut amount of Moles: if X is a equimolar A and B, think if one mole or per liter.\n\nFor example, let\'s think of each mole of X （about 50% A and 50% B） transforms. For each mole of (A + B) there would be a mole of (Y1 + Y2).\n\nBut displacement requires detailed balance.\n\nAlternatively, A \\rightarrow Y1 + reactions, B \\rightarrowY2.\n\nAlternative approach recalculating:\n\nEach component of X,\n\nif X\'s components are （反式 cyclohexene）and C6H8-like in structure, that when partially become either cyclohexane C6H12 and benzene C6H6.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Given an equimolar mixture \( X \) of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, we need to determine the total number of hydrogen atoms in these two liquids. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Identification of Hydrocarbon \( Z \)**:
   - Hydrocarbon \( Z \) is obtained by hydrogenation of both mixture \( X \) and \( Y \).
   - Mass fraction of hydrogen in \( Z \) is 14.28%, leading to the empirical formula \( \text{CH}_2 \).
   - The molecular formula of \( Z \) is determined to be \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} \) (cyclohexane).

2. **Analysis of Mixture \( X \)**:
   - Mixture \( X \) consists of two unsaturated compounds (likely alkenes) that decolorize bromine water.
   - Hydrogenation of \( X \) gives cyclohexane (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} \)), indicating each component in \( X \) hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

3. **Disproportionation Reaction**:
   - Treating \( X \) with platinum (Pt) and heat results in mixture \( Y \) (cyclohexane and benzene).
   - This reaction involves olefin disproportionation, where one molecule gains hydrogen (cyclohexane) and another loses hydrogen (benzene).

4. **Components of Mixture \( X \)**:
   - The two components of \( X \) must be cyclohexene (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10} \)) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_8 \)).
   - Both components hydrogenate to cyclohexane and are non-conjugated.

5. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture \( X \)**:
   - Cyclohexene (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10} \)) has 10 hydrogen atoms.
   - 1,3-cyclohexadiene (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_8 \)) has 8 hydrogen atoms.
   - Total hydrogen atoms = \( 10 + 8 = 18 \).

Thus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture \( X \) is \(\boxed{18}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

/ Oh wait, Z is already saturated. So the other component of Y must be something that can be hydrogenated to give Z.

Wait, if Y is cyclohexane and another compound, say, another alkane, but hydrogenating that would have no effect. So this doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is cyclopropane and something else. But if Z is cyclohexane, then maybe that's not.

Alternatively, hydrogenation of Y is done under "rather severe conditions". Maybe Y has some aromatic compounds. For example, Y is cyclohexane (saturated) and benzene. Benzenewouldn't decolorize bromine unless in the presence of a catalyst. Oh, bromine with benzene needs a Fe catalyst. Without, so benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water. So maybe Y is cyclohexane and benzene? If you hydrogenate benzene (with severe conditions, like high pressure and temperature) to cyclohexane. But then Z, which is cyclohexane, is a component of Y. And hydrogenation of Y (both cyclohexane and benzene) would result in cyclohexane for benzene hydrogenation, and cyclohexane remains. Thus the only product is Z=cyclohexane. Then for X, mixture of? X is two liquids which decolorize bromine. Mixture X is hydrogenated to Z=cyclohexane, so initial X has two compounds which can be hydrogenated to cyclohexane. What could those be? Maybe cyclohexene (a liquid?) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene. But the problem says that in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X, there are no conjugated multiple bonds. So cyclohexene (one double bond, not conjugated) and another molecule with isolated double bonds? Wait, but cyclohexadiene can't have conjugated bonds. No because conjugated is double bonds separated by single bonds. If cyclohexadiene with conjugated bonds aren't allowed, X must have two molecules with possibly non-conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe one triple bond and one double bond. 

But wait, maybe X is benzene and cyclohexane? No, benzene might be in X, but X was supposed to decolorize bromine which benzene doesn't unless a catalyst, so maybe not.

Wait, perhaps X is cyclohexene and another cyclohexene isomer? I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecules in X are some dienes with non-conjugated double bonds, like 1,2-diene? But that should be allenes (cumulated dienes) which might not be stable. Hmm.

Alternatively, X could be two different cycloalkenes. For example, cyclopentene and cycloheptene? But I don't think that makes sense. Also, hydrogenating cyclopentene would give cyclopentane, which is different from cyclohexane.

Wait, think structurally.

Hydrocarbon Z is cyclohexane. Which is made by fully hydrogenating X and Y. Therefore, both X and Y must be more unsaturated. When X is hydrogenated, all double bonds converted to single bonds, leading to cyclohexane. So starting from X, it's possible that the two liquids in X can each add hydrogen to become cyclohexane.

Similarly, Y has two compounds which, when hydrogenated (under severe conditions), gives Z (cyclohexane). But Z is already in Y, so hydrogenation won't affect Z. So, perhaps the other component in Y is benzene. Because benzene can be hydrogenated under severe conditions to cyclohexane, and cyclohexane remains. Therefore, Y is benzene and cyclohexane.

If that's the case, then when heating X (the original unsaturated mixture) with Pt (which is a catalyst for dehydrogenation, perhaps), the mixture undergoes disproportionation. Disproportionation of alkenes into alkanes and aromatic compounds? Wait, for example, suppose X is cyclohexene. Under certain conditions, two molecules could disproportionation into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene. Wait, cyclohexane is more hydrogenated, cyclohexadiene is more dehydrogenated. If that continues to form benzene... But the problem states that Y is formed via disproportionation as a result. If you start with cyclohexene and catalyst, it can disproportion to cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene? Then further reaction?

But the problem states that Y is two equimolar liquids. Let me think. If X is cyclohexene (maybe in mixture, but equimolar, but X is two compounds). Hmm.

Wait, original mixture X is two liquids. Maybe the two components are cis and trans isomers of cyclohexene? No, that would be stereoisomers, but the hydrogenation products would be same. Perhaps a diene and a monoene? But wait, if X's two liquids hydrogenated give same product. If one is cyclohexene (which hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and the other maybe... But how? Another unsaturated compound which can become cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. Maybe a mono-unsaturated and a tri-unsaturated. Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the two components of X might be isomeric alkenes where hydrogenation leads to the same cyclohexane, but structural isomers. For example, 1-cyclohexene and another substituted cyclohexene. But perhaps X is a mixture of some dienes and alkenes. But in their molecules, there are no conjugated multiple bonds. So like 1,2-pentadiene and something else? I need to find the mixture X. Probably the two liquids in X are some dienes and/or alkenes which when hydrogenated give cyclohexane.

Alternatively, the main thing is that there’s a disproportionation leading to benzene and cyclohexane. But to get benzene, perhaps two cyclohexene molecules disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene. Let me check.

Balanced equation: 3 cyclohexene → cyclohexane + benzene. Let's balance: Each C6H10 → C6H12 (hydrogenation) and C6H6 (dehydrogenation). So 3 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6. The H balance? 

3*10=30 H on left.

C6H12 (12 H) + C6H6 (6 H) → 18 H. Difference of 12 H missing. Maybe hydrogens get released?

So 3 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6 + 3 H2.

But unlikely. Alternatively, there's dehydrocyclization. For example, cyclohexene could be dehydrogenate to form benzene. But with platinum, probably leading to aromatic compounds.

But disproportionation implies some molecules get oxidized and others get reduced. In this case, cyclohexene (which is like partially hydrogenated compared to benzene) might lose hydrogen (oxidized to aromatic) and another gains hydrogen (reduced to cyclohexane). Therefore:

If two molecules of C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6

But then stoichiometry: 2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6. Let’s check H balance:

Left side: 2*10 =20 H. Right:12 +6=18. So missing 2 H, perhaps evolves H2 gas. The equation would be 2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6 + H2↑. However, that complicates.

Alternatively, maybe subtracting a different number or adding Pt as a catalyst. But the reaction needs to be in equimolar ratio for Y. Then Y would be two liquids: C6H12 and C6H6. So molecular formula cyclohexane and benzene, which are immiscible? Are both liquids? Cyclohexane is a liquid, benzene is also a liquid (boiling point ~80°C). At room temperature, they’re both liquids. So mixture Y is equimolar cyclohexane and benzene. Then X would be maybe cyclohexene and another compound which when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of benzene and another compound, but wait the problem says X decolorizes bromine water. Benzene under normal conditions does not react with bromine without a catalyst. So if X is an equimolar mix of two substances that decolorize bromine, like cyclohexene and another alkene. Wait, then hydrogenation gives cyclohexane from both cyclohexene. But then mixture Y comes from disproportionation of X? I'm confused.

Wait, process: mixing of X (two liquids which decolorize bromine) that get treated with Pt under heating. Hydrogenation of X gives Z (cyclohexane). Disproportionation yields Y, which is equimolar mixture of two liquids, which are cyclohexane and benzene. Then hydrogenating Y (benzene and cyclohexane) under severe conditions with platinum gives only cyclohexane (hydrog of benzene) cyclonexane stays. So fitting. So in that case, X would be cyclohexene? But X is a mixture of two liquids. Maybe two different cycloalkenes? Or maybe allene and cyclohexene. But with no conjugated bonds.

But the question is, once the actual structure of X is known, then they need to count the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids.

If X is mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexane? No, would that decolorize bromine water? 1,3-cyclohexadiene has conjugated dienes, which react fast with bromine, but cyclohexane does not. Wait, but X is treated as decolorize bromine, so both components must decolorize. Therefore both unsaturated. So if X is, perhaps, the two components each have one double bond, which decolorize bromine. Treatment with Pt causes disproportionation to mixture Y consisting of Benzene (doesn't react) and cyclohexane (doesn't react) in equimolar.

So maybe X is 1,3-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene? Wait, but cyclohexene has one double bond, and 1,3-cyclohexadiene has two non-conjugated double bonds. Wait, 1,3-cyclohexadiene would have isolated double bonds? If a molecule has two non-conjugated double bonds, like 1,3-pentadiene, those double bonds can't conjugate through a single bond. But wait, cyclohexadiene with 1,3-diene: in a cyclohexane ring, 1 and 3 positions aren't conjugated. So maybe. But the question said "there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X". So each molecule in X cannot have conjugated double bonds, but can have isolated ones.

Hence, X must have two compounds, each with isolated double bonds. For each molecule, maybe molecules like bicyclic compounds? Maybe considering a norbornene (bicyclic) or something.

Alternatively, each component could have two non-conjugated double bonds. For example, 1,4-cyclohexadiene. Is that possible? But those molecules. Then on Pt, the dienes due to H-shifts can lead to benzene and to cyclohexane. Alternatively, perhaps each molecule of X could be (a diene and an mono-ene).

Hmm, not sure. Let me try thinking again.

If Z is cyclohexane, probably C6H12. X, upon hydrogenation, forms Z ≥ X consists of compounds which when hydrogenated becomes Z, but the compounds themselves have double bonds.

So possible components of X could be cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both hydrogenate to cyclohexane. Then treatment with Pt under heat leads to their disproportionation into Y: cyclohexane and benzene (C6H6). But both cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8)—let me check stoichiometry.

Taking two molecules of cyclohexene (C6H10) → taking one that gains H2 (to become cyclohexane) and one that loses H2 (to become benzene). For a cyclohexene to cyclohexane: add H2. For cyclohexene to benzene: lose 4 H2? C6H10 + ? To form C6H6 requires loss of 4 H. Since cyclohexene -> benzene would be 3 H2 molecules lost.

Wait, benzene has formula C6H6. So cyclohexene (which is C6H10 vs benzene C6H6). To go from cyclohexene to benzene: need to lose 4 H2 (since 10-6=4 H atoms, which is 2 H2).

But for disproportionation, suppose two cyclohexene molecules (X) transforming into cyclohexane and benzene. Two C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6. Let's check H: 2*10 =20. Right:12 +6=18. So need to lose 2 H, likely H2 gas.

Then Pt-catalyzed reaction:

2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6 + H2

But then same when? But then mechanism here.

But, and mixture X contains perhaps two different dienes: but considering original X is equimolar mixture. If the above reaction requires two C6H10 molecules to make products in equimolar Y. Wait, how does this lead to equimolar Y. Let me see. In the reaction:

2 C6H10 → C6H12 (cyclo) + C6H6 (benzene) + H2. So if X is composed of molecules C6H10 (cyclohexene), then when two molecules react, you get one cyclo and one benzene, but probably each step would release hydrogen gas. Then, the mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. Hence, from two moles of X (cyclohexene), you get one mole each cyclohexane and benzene + H2. However, X was an equimolar mixture of two compounds, so perhaps X is composed of cyclohexene and another compound? The problem says Y is formed as a result of disproportionation of X+Pt/Heat. So perhaps X contains two unsaturated compounds that engage in the dispropotionation. 

Alternatively, think of feeding only one component through (say cyclohexene). Then on Pt, cyclohexene disproportionates into cyclohexane and benzene, they collect in equimolar amounts, hence two components Y. But original X was pure cyclohexene which is a single component. However, the problem states X is a mixture of two. There must be two different components that X consists of. So perhaps benzoic structure or other. 

Alternatively, notes:

If X is acetylene (but that's a gas) – maybe cyclohexyne? Not likely. Wait, no. Consider more carefully example. Let me look.

Wait, the original reaction:

An equimolar mixture X (two liquids) which decolorize bromine (so alkenes or alkynes) treated with Pt when heated becomes mixture Y of two liquids, also equimolar, that don't decolorize bromine. When both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they give Z, which is in Y. Z is cyclohexane.

By X and Y hydrogenilly converted totally into Z (cyclohexane), so X and Y must consist of compounds that have more unsaturation, like mono-enes and maybe benzene (which needs hydrogenation).

But Hydrogenation under severe conditions (Y consists of cyclohexane. Which remains unchanged, and some aromatic compounds, like benzene, which will be hydrogenated to cyclohexane). Meanwhile, X consists of dienes and enes.

Assume; Pt is using as a catalyst for such reactions.

Key insight: The initial mixture X upon heating with Pt gives Y through disproportionation. That reaction converts two starting material molecules (equimolar mix) into two products (equimolar mix). So need stoichiometrically may couple between reactant ratio.

Suppose X has two components, A and B. Then on Pt, those disproportionate to yield Y which includes Z (cyclohexane). Perhaps A and B transfer hydrogen:

A→ becomes something more hydrogenated (cyclohexane) and B → less hydrogenated (benzene). So equation. Thus: A + B → cyclohexane + benzene. But if X is equimolar in A and B, then Y is equimolar. 

Therefore, problem: What kind of reaction can split two different precursor molecules into cyclohexane and benzene. Key is checking hydrogenation.

Assuming A and B are different in their degrees of unsaturation, but once hydrogenated become Cyclohexane.

Suppose Y is Both cyclohexane and benzene (1:1)

Hydrogenated,

Cyclohexane stays same, benzene becomes cyclohexane. Hence Z is formed.

What starting materials would hydrogenate to cyclo hexane?

Possibly:

A is cyclohexene (C6H10), which hydrogenate to C6H12; Benzene would require that A could something else?

Wait, other option:

Think former finds aren't leading. Let's think of the hydrogens: reactant X when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane from both liquids. Y is an equimolar mixture of those two and Y (which has cyclohexane and benzene character), so one component in Y is already Z.

Wait Cyclohexane (Z) is inert. The other in Y when hydrogenated (i.e., benzene) becomes cyclohexane. Therefore, the two components in X each need, when hydrogenated, to become cyclohexane. So X is a mixture of 1) a compound that when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane and 2) cyclohexane.

Wait, no, cannot be—because cyclohexane already is alkanes. But when treated with Pt and heated, X converts to Y through disproportionation.

Wait, the problem states X is being treated with platinum (catalyst) when heated to form Y. So the A and B of X, which are both unsaturated.

So, assuming that each component of X is almost done that upon hydrogenation they give Z (cyclohexane). Then components must be isomeric with respect to each other. For example, as cyclohexene (C6H10) and another cyclohexene with a different substituent, but same product after hydrogenation.

Alternatively, each component can hydrogenate to cyclohexane, but both start from a different position.

But after Pt and heat, they might have two compounds in Y. Let’s look for known disproportionation reactions involving alkenes with Pt.

Alternatively, the components might be butadiene derivatives. No, but then hydrogenation would give mixturbation products.

Wait, another approach: since Z is C6H12. To hydrogenate either X or Y gives Z. When X will have compounds which when hydrogenated gives Z. So each compound in X must add H2 rings. Then Х could consist of cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8): both would add hydrogen to produce C6H12. When you hydrogenated both in X, they become cyclohexane. The yield of Z is pure cyclohexane.

Platinum on heating with X (the mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene) leads to disproportionation. How?? Well, maybe cyclohexene oxidizes and reduces. If cyclohexene (C6H10) can perform a formal loss and gain of hydrogen. For instance:

 one cyclohexene molecule gains H2 (to form cyclohexane C6H12), while another loses H2 (to form C6H8, cyclohexadiène). If you have properly mixed different ratios. But original X is mix of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene). Maybe ammonia DE?

Wait, I don't think platinum usually causes addition or abstraction of hydrogen. Maybe-

Hold on, perhaps the reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene in presence of platinum can trimerize??? Not likely. Or the actual process with platinum as a catalyst causes dehydroaromatization. - Equimolar mix Y is benzene and cyclohexane. The way to form benzene could be via diene to aromatic。

If you take a molecule with three Double bonds, maybe, but cyclohexene cannot directly form benzene. Think about cyclohexane到苯的结构变化。

If we have, say, 1,3-cyclohexadiene heating with platinum. Maybe cyclohexadiene induces, with catalyst, the loss of hydrogen gas to form benzene. But maybe: If X has two components, both of which can lose or gain hydrogen.

Wait, yes. Suppose the two components are 1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene. Then, 1C6H8 and 1C6H10.

Under Pt, the C6H10 could lose H2, converting to C6H8; and the C6H8 loses more H2 to form benzene. While another possibility for  maybe re-shuffling.

So equimolar mixture Y would thus have benzene (from dienes via Pt dehydrogenation) and cyclohexane (from undergoing hydrogenation via Pt). But Pt as a catalyst—diagram this:

For example, think:

C6H10 (cyclohexene) → if cyclohexene is hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. But why would Pt (which is a hydrogenation catalyst) need hydrogen? Wait, but in the initial problem statement, when X is treated with Platinum when heated, they form Y. So maybe heat and Pt in absence of additional hydrogen leads to different process. Dehydrogenation, perhaps.

Ah, important: When X is treated with Platinum when heated, which causes disproportionation. So it's a dehydrogenation reaction. Since Pt is a metal catalyst, that facilitates the removal of hydrogen as H2. For example, in processes like the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes, aromatization (forming benzene).

So suppose mixture X is a mix of liquids which are (1,3-cyclohexadiene and another compound). Wait when heated over Pt (dehydrogenation conditions). 1,3-cyclohexadiene could lose H2 and form benzene. But then maybe reaction of:

3 C6H8 → C6H6 + 2 C6H9 (?)

Wait this is getting complicate. Another thought: Suppose each molecule in X, when Dehydrogenized will lose hydrogen. But if it's an equimolar mix, the average hydrogen loss (redistribution) could create elements in Y that are cyclohexane and benzene.

Wait, reconsider

Hydrogenation converts all the multiple down to saturate.

Nit. Think the key may be that the compounds in X are cyclohexene and benzenece前生体.

Scratch that. While struggling to find the answer, perhaps I should find out where to find the compounds involved.

Since Z is cyclohexane used as a solvent. Z is a component of Y. Y is mixture of two liquids: cyclohexane and benzene. X is hydrogenated specifically to cyclohexane.

Thus, when X is treated with platinum and heat, which prompts dehydrogenation of some molecules and deuteration possibly of others. Wait, maybe another term is dehydrocyclization.

For example:

3 cyclohexene → benzene + 3 H2.

But apportionment not a equimolar mixture. Alternatively, if X comprises cyclohexene        ?

Wait, or another scenario:

If X is a mixture of 1,3-pentadiene and ? No that might not cyclo any.

Alternatively, X is vinyl cyclohexene. for after hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Alternatively, think another way—because in the end, we need to count the number of hydrogen in the liquid components of X. Maybe it's about going to the problem step-by-step:

Z has massthess H 14.28% iscyclohexane (C6H12).

Hydrogenation of X (where X is two compounds A and B) gives cyclohexane.

Thus, both A and B must have the same number of carbons as Z and addn of hydrogen will surpassi ng.

So number of carbons in A and B would be 6, because Z has 6.

Imagine A is a cyclohexene (C6H10) and B is something else with 6 carbons and which adds H2 into C6H12. Such as a Cyclohexa-diene (C6H8).

But mix of hexene and hexadienewhich mixes®.

Thus, cyclohexene has 10 H，hexadiene has 8 H。mix equimolar, the total Hs per two molecules is 10 + 8 = 18. Queried question: What's the total number of H atoms in two liquids of X.

If the components are cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene, then total H in X would be (10 +8)=18. Thus 18 total H atoms in the two molecules. So answer: \boxed{18}

But we need verify structure matches all conditions. All conditions:

1. X is mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene (each liquid hydrocarbons), which decolorizes bromine. Each has isolated double bonds (1双键和2 isolated双健) ensuring no conjugation.

2.  treatments with Pt heat (dehydrogenation?) leads to disproportionation to cyclohexane and benzene.

But wait, if X is cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene, how would Pt and heat towers convert them to Y (cyclohexane and benzene). For example, each Cyclohexene could hydrogenate to cyclohexane in presence of H2. Or, need H2?

Process:

When Pt is used with heat, in the absence of H2 should it driving Diels-Alder reaction or dehydrogenation.

Assuming it's a dehydrogenation setting, possibly catalyzing the formation of benzene.

But for example, stoichiometry of  cyclohexen ↑+ cyclohexadiene undergoing reaction to cyclohexane + benzene?

Possible: cyclohexene (C6H10) and cyclohexadiene (C6H8) interconnect to form CH2 components.

But total Carbon in Y? Okay,Y comprises two components: cyclohexan (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). Which accounts for all six chloro rings.

But amount of Moles: if X is a equimolar A and B, think if one mole or per liter.

For example, let's think of each mole of X （about 50% A and 50% B） transforms. For each mole of (A + B) there would be a mole of (Y1 + Y2).

But displacement requires detailed balance.

Alternatively, A \rightarrow Y1 + reactions, B \rightarrowY2.

Alternative approach recalculating:

Each component of X,

if X's components are （反式 cyclohexene）and C6H8-like in structure, that when partially become either cyclohexane C6H12 and benzene C6H6. So:

Suppose A:

Suppose in the presence of Pt and heat, two molecules react: A would add hydrogen (to become C6H12) 、B lose hydrogen (becoming C6H6). So situations requires:

Since X is thorium equimolar A and B， one accumulates whether Each mole leads to production of two moI ecules:

But logical chain ends here.

Accept that X is mix of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Both when H ydrogenooiiited become cyclohexane.

Total carbon in X0027ls: C6 in each, no transfer.

When treated with Pt reaction drivataroportion yielded for each mole unit).

 possibly the answer is cyclohexene and cyclohexadi uintynthesizes。 Then the，quier el número de átomos de hidró门 cada líqu。Suma de AT example.

Cyclohexene is C6H10, 10 H.

Assumed another component is Kaplan name, for example x y. According. my propuesto, the other isC6H8.

So total of 10 + 8 =18 H. Hence answer \^Lar is 18.

Thus猜想:两个 líquidos分别含10和8氢，液之总的H原子数为18.

Assuming that is plausible and passes all conditions, the answer is 18.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{18}

Perhaps the unsaturated components in X (maybe cyclohexene and cyclohexane? But no, cyclohexane doesn\'t decolorize bromine.) Alternatively, if X consists of cyclohexene and another diene? But that might form conjugated dienes when disproportionated. But the problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X, so probably not.\n\nAnother possibility is that mixture X is cyclohexene and another monoene. But if there\'s another monoene with different structure, but maybe they open up or transfer hydrogen. Alternatively, disproportionation of cyclohexene over platinum: under certain conditions, cyclohexene can dismutate into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene. But cyclohexadiene would have conjugated bonds, which the problem in X says "no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules". Hmm.\n\nWait, the X mixture is two liquids. So suppose in X they are cyclohexene and another non-conjugated alkene. If we heat with Pt, maybe cyclohexene undergoes disproportionation to cyclohexane and benzene, because benzene hydrogenation requires more severe conditions, but Y would be cyclohexane and benzene? Wait, benzene might not be easily hydrogenated under the same conditions. But hydrogenation under severe conditions (more heat/pressure) would hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane as well, according to the problem.\n\nBut when hydrogenated, both X and Y yield only Z (cyclohexane). Let\'s check hydrogenation of X components. Suppose X is cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (but the problem states X can\'t have conjugated double bonds, so non-conjugated dienes. Disproportionation via Pt could cause hydrogen transfer. For example, two cyclohexene molecules could convert into one cyclohexane (by adding two hydrogen) and one 1,3-cyclohexadiene (by losing two hydrogen) — but that creates conjugated dienes in Y. But problem says Y does not decolorize bromine, meaning there must not be unsaturated bonds in Y, which would mean this is contradicted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is benzene and cyclohexane. No, because benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine water (maybe with a catalyst, but under normal conditions, only alkenes would quickly do that). Wait, X consists of two components, each of which decolorizes bromine. Benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine without a catalyst, so probably X has cycloalkenes. Let\'s think, maybe cyclopentene and cyclohexene? But hydrogenation of each would form cyclopentane and cyclohexane. Which wouldn\'t match the product being only Z (cyclohexane). Therefore, if both X and Y, when hydrogenated yield Z (cyclohexane), each component in X must have a structure that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Similarly for Y.\n\nBut Y contains cyclohexane (Z) and another compound. When hydrogenated, that other compound becomes cyclohexane as well. So the other compound might be something like cyclohexane with another hydrogenatable group. However, if Y is cyclohexane (saturated, so can\'t hydrogenate further) and something else. If the something else must after hydrogenation become cyclohexane, then that compound must be benzene (if under severe conditions with high hydrogen pressure, Pt, maybe benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane). If Y is equimolar cyclohexane and benzene, then hydrogenation would convert benzene to cyclohexane and cyclohexane remains cyclohexane, hence the product is only cyclohexane. Then in Y--the components are benzene and cyclohexane, which do not decolorize bromine (but benzene can react with bromine under certain conditions, but in aqueous bromine, may need a catalyst). So maybe that\'s possible. Then X is a mixture of cyclohexene and ?\n\nAlternatively, maybe X is benzene and cyclohexane already, but then X wouldn\'t decolorize bromine, conflicting, so probably X contains unsaturated hydrocarbons. Alternatively, if X is 1,3-cyclohexadiene and benzene? But benzene still wouldn\'t decolorize bromine. Wait, maybe using the process of elimination.\n\nAlso, transition: When X (decays colorizes bromine) is treated with Pt (a catalyst) under heat, undergoes disproportionation creating Y. Let\'s think of cyclohexene (which decolorizes bromine) undergoing disproportionation. How does cyclohexene react over platinum? Catalytic dehydrogenation? Alternatively, heating cyclohexene with platinum (which might act as a dehydrogenation catalyst). For example, cyclohexene might be dehydrogenated to benzene and hydrogen; but in such a case where would the hydrogen go? Alternatively, a disproportionation reaction where some hydrogen is transferred. For example, two cyclohexene molecules could convert into cyclohexane (adding H2) and cyclohexadiene (losing H2). But the product is a cyclohexadiene (conjugated?) and cyclohexane. Let us check, if the cyclohexadiene formed has conjugated double bonds, then the mixture Y would contain cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene. But the question states that Y does NOT decolorize bromine. However, cyclohexadiene would (if conjugated). Alternatively, is there another possibility? If, in cyclohexene, the disproportionation converts to cyclohexane and a compound with a ring strain that is non-conjugated?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is cyclohexene → methylcyclopentane? But I don\'t see how that\'s a disproportionation. Alternatively, if several alkenes disproportion hydrogen to form alkanes and cycloalkanes. Wait, structuring this requires consideration.\n\nSuppose X is a mix of cyclohexene and some other cycloalkene (say cyclopentene). At Pt, heat induces disproportionation, leading each cycloalkene losing H2 converting to something... but maybe, two molecules donate H2 to form a cycloalkane. However, multiple components make it complicated. Alternatively, the entire mixture X is made of two different substances that when heated with Pt undergo mutual dehydrogenation and hydrogenation.\n\nAlternatively, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclodecene, I can\'t think. Maybe if cyclic alkenes of the same ring size?\n\nAlternatively, maybe cis- and trans-isomers of cyclohexene. But would Pt catalyze isomerization? Disproportionation, though, requires transfer of hydrogen. Alternatively, perhaps shifting double bonds. Wait, maybe 1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexane. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem involves benzene and cyclohexane. No, but I\'m stuck here.\n\nWait, Z is cyclohexane. So when you hydrogenate both X and Y they produce cyclohexane. Thus, both X and Y must contain compounds that upon hydrogenation become cyclohexane. Since Y contains cyclohexane and another component, say B, which when hydrogenated also becomes cyclohexane. Therefore, B must be an aromatic hydrocarbon (such as benzene) which requires more severe conditions to hydrogenate. Hence, Y can be benzene and cyclohexane. When hydrogenated, benzene (C₆H₆) + 3H2 → cyclohexane. So, under the given "severe" conditions, which would be high pressure and temperature, benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane, and cyclohexane remains the same. Therefore, Y would be a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane.\n\nThen, starting from mixture X, where do these come from? Under Pt, heating, if X undergoes disproportionation to form Y (benzene and cyclohexane), then X must have been a mixture that can turn into those via hydrogen transfer. The only way that happens is if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and some other unsaturated hydrocarbon. For example, cyclohexene could undergo disproportionation. Let me check:\n\nFor cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) to disproportiate via hydrogen transfer, two molecules might transfer H2:\n\n2 C₆H₁₀ → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₈ (cyclohexadiene or maybe benzene?)\n\nBut  C₆H₈ could be 1,3-cyclohexadiene (with conjugated dienes), which would decolorize bromine, but Y is supposed to not do that. Alternatively, if the process results in aromatization, C₆H₈ is benzene? Wait, benzene is C₆H₆. If two cyclohexene molecules (each w/ one double bond and 6 H) disportione:\n\nIn disproportionation... perhaps for each molecule that gains H2 (saturation) becomes cyclohexane, another loses H2. But in that case:\n\nIf X is two cyclohexene molecules, one adds two hydrogens (to become cyclohexane) and the other loses two hyd.\n\nBut to form benzene from, say four hydrogens removed? Not linear. Alternatively, three such reaction steps. Maybe with Pt catalyst, the cyclohexene dehydrogenation to benzene. However, according to past knowledge, dehydrogenation of cyclohexene over platinum generally gives benzene only with significant heating and H2 removal, not just via a simple disproportionation with another cyclohexene. But if another molecule of cyclohexene acts as a hydrogen acceptor, perhaps! Perhaps:\n\n3 cyclohexene → benzene + 3 cyclohexane (but not in equimolar quantities). Equimolar would happen if formula is 2 molecules cyclohexene → cyclohexane + benzene. Let\'s check: 2 C₆H₁₀ (each cyclohexene) would have total C₁₂H₂₀. If converted to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆), then check H count: C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ requires C₁₂H₁₈. But starting C₁₂H₂₀ would need loss of two H₂ molecules (maybe in gas form). Therefore, the reaction would require 2 H₂ released. But H2 removal via Pt catalyst\'s presence. So:\n\n2 C₆H₁₀ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ + 2H2? Or perhaps:\n\nSuppose in the presence of platinum catalyst and heating, cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) disproportionates into cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). The H2 lost from the formation of benzene (which is 4 H, since the two starting cyclohexenes have 2x10=20 H, cyclohexane + benzene have 12 +6=18 H), so losing 2 H. Which would be released as H2 gas. Are compounds X and Y in liquid form?\n\nBut in the problem, mixtures X and Y are "liquids", while H2 would be gas, but perhaps escape during the reaction. If this is the case, then X is two molecules that reacted (each cyclohexene) to form one molecule cyclohexane (Z) and one benzene. Therefore, Mixture Y would be equimolar cyclohexane and benzene. This would match, since hydrogenation of X (cyclohexene) over Pt would hydrogenate cyclohexene → cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of Y would hydrogenate benzene → cyclohexane (if more severe conditions), and cyclohexane remains same. So end product Z is the same from both X and Y.\n\nBut in this scenario, mixture X is equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and... what else? Hmm wait the problem states X is "an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water". So if X had cyclohexene and another alkene that when hydrogenate becomes cyclohexane. But if the products of X\'s hydrogenation give Z (and Y\'s as well), then both components must hydrogenate to Z.\n\nBut according to our earlier analysis, 2 cyclohexene would react (if X is pure cyclohexene, but the problem says mixture of two liquids). Alternatively, maybe X is 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, which decolorize bromine. But then transferring hydrogen between them could achieve the relif...\n\nBut the problem states "no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X\'s components". If we have cyclohexene and cycloheptyne.\n\nWait, another angle. Z is cyclohexane. If X is a mixture of two different cycloalkenes, each with different rings. For example, bicyclic or similar. But if hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, they must contain rings, like norbornene might upon hydrogenation become norbornane. But that\'s not cyclohexane. Alternatively, if X comprises cyclopentene and cycloheptene, but once hydrogenated, they would give cyclopentane and cycloheptane. Hence, not cyclohexane.\n\nUnless X is two different structures that can hydrogenate to the same cyclohexane. For example, one could have methylcyclopentene and another something. No. Maybe (if considering hexenes)... If Z is cyclohexane, perhaps X has non-conjugated dienes that after full hydrogenation would become cyclohexane. But they must be hydrogenated into a cycloalkane.\n\nBut cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. How to get that? For example, perhaps the starting materials are cyclohexadiene...\nBut back to the earlier idea that X is cyclohexene and cyclooctene.\n\nAlternatively, think outside the ring. Suppose linear molecules. For example, Z is cyclohexane, so imply the X compounds could be linear alkenes that when hydrogenated produce linear alkanes, but no—centon waala is result not cyclohexane. So cyclo length.\n\nThus, perhaps X consists of m benzene and?? No., bromine decolouration requires addition. Thus..:\n\nAlternatively, think about other unsaturated compounds. Maybe dienes. If mixture X is of 1,4-pentadiene and 1-pentene. That is not likely. The problem states there\'s no conjugated bonds. So maybe methylcyclohexene and cyclohexene. Either that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is bmx of cyclohexene and another cyclohexene’s isomer. An alternative construction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referencing acid-catalyzed dienol... but maybe key is, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), hydrogenated product. Hence, original X and Y\' components must contain rings, when hydrogenated.\n\nIf I proceed with the cyclohexene assumption. Start with X: cyclohexene (decays bromine, hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and another component. The other component in X must be something that hydrogenates to cyclohexane as well. Thus,\n\nWait the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed by disproportionation. Since Y gives only Z upon hydrogenation, but Z is a component of Y (so after formation, one component is Z, another which hydrogenates to Z). So cyclohexane (Z) and benzene. Then X, when hydrogenated under severe conditions (which would plow through any double bonds), would produce only Z, cyclohexane. For this to be, X\'s components have to hydrogenate (each) to cyclohexane. Might X contain cyclohexene and benzene? But benzene does not decolorize bromine. We know X does.So X must consist of two different alkenes, each of which can be hydrogenated into cyclohexane.\n\nAh, wait. If we have two dienes? For example, two isomeric non-conjugated dienes in X. Hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. When heated with platinum, they would redistribute. But I need specifics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the components could be methylenecyclohexane (spiran) and vinylcyclopentane. Or some terpenes.\n\nAlternatively, since the hydrogenation product is only cyclohexane, which requires that each component must form a six-carbon cycloalkane upon hydrogenation. Therefore, each component of X and the components of Y (excluding Z which doesn\'t need hydrogenation) must a six-membered cycloalkyl group with unsaturation. So perhaps X contains cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). But the recipe goereds for X is no conjugattion. So if mixture X contains 1,2-dialkene but do se.\n\nWait, getting stuck here we might need to think again. Given that the problem says X is a mixture that discolorizes bromine, so alkenes, opening up to bromine via addition. Upon Pt, they process into a mixture Y (Equi, two liquids, including Z=cyclohexane). So probably Y is benzene and cyclohexane. Mixture X is cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene? No, since the cyclohexadiene would create conjugation, which the problem for X disallows. Wait, cyclohexene is zero conjugation. But to X beTwo isomeric of cyclohexene. But in that case, both would hydrogenate to cyclohexane, and when Pi with same loactions do.\n\nAlternatively, look at other types of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Could X be cyclohexene and an alkyne, perhaps 1-hexyne. But when you hydrogenate an alkyne to alkane, you get hexane. but Z is cyclohexane, so that won’t work ordeals. Got vi benlin these caveats.\n\nAlternatively, possible that X is mixture of two enjoined rings with separate double bonds, say bicyclo structures. For example, norbornene (a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure with a double bond). Hydrogenating norbornene gives norbornane, which isn\'t cyclohexane, so no. Alternatively, maybe the double bonds are in different positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem follows a classic example of 1,4-dihydronaphthalene and bicyclo structures… but murky.\n\nWait, upon rehashing the data:\n\n1. Mixture X: equimolar two liquids, both decolorize bromine → likely alkenes/alkynes, not conjugated (per problem’s hint)\n2. Treated with platinum with heat, allowing disproportionation (possibly dehydrogenerating one and hydrogenating another, transfer of H2 between molecules)\n3. Forms Y: equimolar two liquids, no bromine decolouration → both saturated (or aromatic)\n4. Both X and Y hydrogenate (severe conditions) to Z = cyclohexane (14.28% H: fits C6H12)\n5. Z is part of Y: Z is one component of mixture Y; thus, Y is cyclohexane and something else (say, benzene), as hydrogenating cyclohexane would yield no change (already saturated) and hydrogenating benzene (in severe conditions) gives cyclohexane. So Y would be 50-50 Cyclohexane and benzene.\n\nTherefore, if Y is cyclohexane and benzene, then H2 under harsh conditions for the mixture hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane. Hence, the reactant X becomes the parent need breakdown to give Y\'s components. Then, the composition of X must be molecules that when undergo Pt-catalyzed disproportionation produce C6H12 and C6H6. What are those molecules. Suppose X is cyclohexene and another cyclohexene. Let then,\n\n2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H8 (But C6H8 could be cyclohexadiene, but proximity to grind, but problem states Y can\'t decolorize bromine, so not formed). If C6H8 further dehydrote, benzene C6H6. Wait, but this displaces multiple H2. Thus, three C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6 + 4 H2, but slivovitz... The Yield molar equivalent- user the Problem states Y is equimolar two components and started with X equimolar. So let us initial proportionality.\n\nSuppose that two moles of X\'s components (two liquids; say, cyclohexene and some other) yields one mole each of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\nLet’s do stoichiometry. When cyclohexene (C6H10):\n\nCH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 -> not exactly, but we can consider each molecule.\n\nReact how?\n\nSuppose that. Considering  in the presence Pt, cyclohexene dimerizes or disproportionation. But maybe each cake reformed; otherwise, r ipe Pinoli.\n\nAlternatively, cross-disproportionation. For example, mix ture balance between dehydrogenation and hydrogenation: if X contains 1,3-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated, but when tight, but he problem said No conjugated bonds )\n\nWait maybe X is not two different compounds but isomers of each.\n\nAlternatively, meta-conversion of such. Suppose X is a mixture of vinylic cyclohexane (substituted cyclohexane with a double bond somewhere) leading to the formation of cyclohexane and benzene.\n\nIn a more holistic arrest, given time constraints and enumerated steps:\n\nLet me think critically.\n\nHydrocarbon Z is 14.28% H by mass, we know Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).\n\nGiven mixture X is two liquids, which when mixed together are responsible for discoloring bromine (each has a double bond?),  Hydrogenation leads to Z. This implies that X is two different alkenes (since they decolorize bromine), both of which when hydrogenated (even if they have different structures) give cyclohexane.\n\nSo equivalently, perhaps both alkenes in X are carbocyclic six-membered rings with a different double bond position.\n\nAlternatively, one could be cyclohexene and another a bicyclic alkene that, upon hydrogenation, breaks a ring to form cyclohexane.\n\nWait, another angle: if Z is cyclohexane, unsaturated compounds may wrestle círculos Askari, say Qate directly when hydrogenated yield cyclohexane.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 Moreover, the disproportionation reaction needs to take the original unsaturated X components and through redistribution (gaining and losing hydrogen), create cyclohexane and possibly some other cycloalkene or benzene.

Wait, but X was treated with platinum under heating leading to disproportionation. Perhaps the unsaturated components in X (maybe cyclohexene and cyclohexane? But no, cyclohexane doesn't decolorize bromine.) Alternatively, if X consists of cyclohexene and another diene? But that might form conjugated dienes when disproportionated. But the problem states there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X, so probably not.

Another possibility is that mixture X is cyclohexene and another monoene. But if there's another monoene with different structure, but maybe they open up or transfer hydrogen. Alternatively, disproportionation of cyclohexene over platinum: under certain conditions, cyclohexene can dismutate into cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene. But cyclohexadiene would have conjugated bonds, which the problem in X says "no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules". Hmm.

Wait, the X mixture is two liquids. So suppose in X they are cyclohexene and another non-conjugated alkene. If we heat with Pt, maybe cyclohexene undergoes disproportionation to cyclohexane and benzene, because benzene hydrogenation requires more severe conditions, but Y would be cyclohexane and benzene? Wait, benzene might not be easily hydrogenated under the same conditions. But hydrogenation under severe conditions (more heat/pressure) would hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane as well, according to the problem.

But when hydrogenated, both X and Y yield only Z (cyclohexane). Let's check hydrogenation of X components. Suppose X is cyclohexene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene (but the problem states X can't have conjugated double bonds, so non-conjugated dienes. Disproportionation via Pt could cause hydrogen transfer. For example, two cyclohexene molecules could convert into one cyclohexane (by adding two hydrogen) and one 1,3-cyclohexadiene (by losing two hydrogen) — but that creates conjugated dienes in Y. But problem says Y does not decolorize bromine, meaning there must not be unsaturated bonds in Y, which would mean this is contradicted.

Alternatively, perhaps X is benzene and cyclohexane. No, because benzene doesn't decolorize bromine water (maybe with a catalyst, but under normal conditions, only alkenes would quickly do that). Wait, X consists of two components, each of which decolorizes bromine. Benzene doesn't decolorize bromine without a catalyst, so probably X has cycloalkenes. Let's think, maybe cyclopentene and cyclohexene? But hydrogenation of each would form cyclopentane and cyclohexane. Which wouldn't match the product being only Z (cyclohexane). Therefore, if both X and Y, when hydrogenated yield Z (cyclohexane), each component in X must have a structure that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. Similarly for Y.

But Y contains cyclohexane (Z) and another compound. When hydrogenated, that other compound becomes cyclohexane as well. So the other compound might be something like cyclohexane with another hydrogenatable group. However, if Y is cyclohexane (saturated, so can't hydrogenate further) and something else. If the something else must after hydrogenation become cyclohexane, then that compound must be benzene (if under severe conditions with high hydrogen pressure, Pt, maybe benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane). If Y is equimolar cyclohexane and benzene, then hydrogenation would convert benzene to cyclohexane and cyclohexane remains cyclohexane, hence the product is only cyclohexane. Then in Y--the components are benzene and cyclohexane, which do not decolorize bromine (but benzene can react with bromine under certain conditions, but in aqueous bromine, may need a catalyst). So maybe that's possible. Then X is a mixture of cyclohexene and ?

Alternatively, maybe X is benzene and cyclohexane already, but then X wouldn't decolorize bromine, conflicting, so probably X contains unsaturated hydrocarbons. Alternatively, if X is 1,3-cyclohexadiene and benzene? But benzene still wouldn't decolorize bromine. Wait, maybe using the process of elimination.

Also, transition: When X (decays colorizes bromine) is treated with Pt (a catalyst) under heat, undergoes disproportionation creating Y. Let's think of cyclohexene (which decolorizes bromine) undergoing disproportionation. How does cyclohexene react over platinum? Catalytic dehydrogenation? Alternatively, heating cyclohexene with platinum (which might act as a dehydrogenation catalyst). For example, cyclohexene might be dehydrogenated to benzene and hydrogen; but in such a case where would the hydrogen go? Alternatively, a disproportionation reaction where some hydrogen is transferred. For example, two cyclohexene molecules could convert into cyclohexane (adding H2) and cyclohexadiene (losing H2). But the product is a cyclohexadiene (conjugated?) and cyclohexane. Let us check, if the cyclohexadiene formed has conjugated double bonds, then the mixture Y would contain cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene. But the question states that Y does NOT decolorize bromine. However, cyclohexadiene would (if conjugated). Alternatively, is there another possibility? If, in cyclohexene, the disproportionation converts to cyclohexane and a compound with a ring strain that is non-conjugated?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is cyclohexene → methylcyclopentane? But I don't see how that's a disproportionation. Alternatively, if several alkenes disproportion hydrogen to form alkanes and cycloalkanes. Wait, structuring this requires consideration.

Suppose X is a mix of cyclohexene and some other cycloalkene (say cyclopentene). At Pt, heat induces disproportionation, leading each cycloalkene losing H2 converting to something... but maybe, two molecules donate H2 to form a cycloalkane. However, multiple components make it complicated. Alternatively, the entire mixture X is made of two different substances that when heated with Pt undergo mutual dehydrogenation and hydrogenation.

Alternatively, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclodecene, I can't think. Maybe if cyclic alkenes of the same ring size?

Alternatively, maybe cis- and trans-isomers of cyclohexene. But would Pt catalyze isomerization? Disproportionation, though, requires transfer of hydrogen. Alternatively, perhaps shifting double bonds. Wait, maybe 1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexane. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves benzene and cyclohexane. No, but I'm stuck here.

Wait, Z is cyclohexane. So when you hydrogenate both X and Y they produce cyclohexane. Thus, both X and Y must contain compounds that upon hydrogenation become cyclohexane. Since Y contains cyclohexane and another component, say B, which when hydrogenated also becomes cyclohexane. Therefore, B must be an aromatic hydrocarbon (such as benzene) which requires more severe conditions to hydrogenate. Hence, Y can be benzene and cyclohexane. When hydrogenated, benzene (C₆H₆) + 3H2 → cyclohexane. So, under the given "severe" conditions, which would be high pressure and temperature, benzene hydrogenates to cyclohexane, and cyclohexane remains the same. Therefore, Y would be a mixture of benzene and cyclohexane.

Then, starting from mixture X, where do these come from? Under Pt, heating, if X undergoes disproportionation to form Y (benzene and cyclohexane), then X must have been a mixture that can turn into those via hydrogen transfer. The only way that happens is if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and some other unsaturated hydrocarbon. For example, cyclohexene could undergo disproportionation. Let me check:

For cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) to disproportiate via hydrogen transfer, two molecules might transfer H2:

2 C₆H₁₀ → C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane) + C₆H₈ (cyclohexadiene or maybe benzene?)

But  C₆H₈ could be 1,3-cyclohexadiene (with conjugated dienes), which would decolorize bromine, but Y is supposed to not do that. Alternatively, if the process results in aromatization, C₆H₈ is benzene? Wait, benzene is C₆H₆. If two cyclohexene molecules (each w/ one double bond and 6 H) disportione:

In disproportionation... perhaps for each molecule that gains H2 (saturation) becomes cyclohexane, another loses H2. But in that case:

If X is two cyclohexene molecules, one adds two hydrogens (to become cyclohexane) and the other loses two hyd.

But to form benzene from, say four hydrogens removed? Not linear. Alternatively, three such reaction steps. Maybe with Pt catalyst, the cyclohexene dehydrogenation to benzene. However, according to past knowledge, dehydrogenation of cyclohexene over platinum generally gives benzene only with significant heating and H2 removal, not just via a simple disproportionation with another cyclohexene. But if another molecule of cyclohexene acts as a hydrogen acceptor, perhaps! Perhaps:

3 cyclohexene → benzene + 3 cyclohexane (but not in equimolar quantities). Equimolar would happen if formula is 2 molecules cyclohexene → cyclohexane + benzene. Let's check: 2 C₆H₁₀ (each cyclohexene) would have total C₁₂H₂₀. If converted to cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆), then check H count: C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ requires C₁₂H₁₈. But starting C₁₂H₂₀ would need loss of two H₂ molecules (maybe in gas form). Therefore, the reaction would require 2 H₂ released. But H2 removal via Pt catalyst's presence. So:

2 C₆H₁₀ → C₆H₁₂ + C₆H₆ + 2H2? Or perhaps:

Suppose in the presence of platinum catalyst and heating, cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) disproportionates into cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) and benzene (C₆H₆). The H2 lost from the formation of benzene (which is 4 H, since the two starting cyclohexenes have 2x10=20 H, cyclohexane + benzene have 12 +6=18 H), so losing 2 H. Which would be released as H2 gas. Are compounds X and Y in liquid form?

But in the problem, mixtures X and Y are "liquids", while H2 would be gas, but perhaps escape during the reaction. If this is the case, then X is two molecules that reacted (each cyclohexene) to form one molecule cyclohexane (Z) and one benzene. Therefore, Mixture Y would be equimolar cyclohexane and benzene. This would match, since hydrogenation of X (cyclohexene) over Pt would hydrogenate cyclohexene → cyclohexane. Hydrogenation of Y would hydrogenate benzene → cyclohexane (if more severe conditions), and cyclohexane remains same. So end product Z is the same from both X and Y.

But in this scenario, mixture X is equimolar mixture of cyclohexene and... what else? Hmm wait the problem states X is "an equimolar mixture of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water". So if X had cyclohexene and another alkene that when hydrogenate becomes cyclohexane. But if the products of X's hydrogenation give Z (and Y's as well), then both components must hydrogenate to Z.

But according to our earlier analysis, 2 cyclohexene would react (if X is pure cyclohexene, but the problem says mixture of two liquids). Alternatively, maybe X is 1,3-cyclohexadiene and 1,4-cyclohexadiene, which decolorize bromine. But then transferring hydrogen between them could achieve the relif...

But the problem states "no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X's components". If we have cyclohexene and cycloheptyne.

Wait, another angle. Z is cyclohexane. If X is a mixture of two different cycloalkenes, each with different rings. For example, bicyclic or similar. But if hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, they must contain rings, like norbornene might upon hydrogenation become norbornane. But that's not cyclohexane. Alternatively, if X comprises cyclopentene and cycloheptene, but once hydrogenated, they would give cyclopentane and cycloheptane. Hence, not cyclohexane.

Unless X is two different structures that can hydrogenate to the same cyclohexane. For example, one could have methylcyclopentene and another something. No. Maybe (if considering hexenes)... If Z is cyclohexane, perhaps X has non-conjugated dienes that after full hydrogenation would become cyclohexane. But they must be hydrogenated into a cycloalkane.

But cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. How to get that? For example, perhaps the starting materials are cyclohexadiene...
But back to the earlier idea that X is cyclohexene and cyclooctene.

Alternatively, think outside the ring. Suppose linear molecules. For example, Z is cyclohexane, so imply the X compounds could be linear alkenes that when hydrogenated produce linear alkanes, but no—centon waala is result not cyclohexane. So cyclo length.

Thus, perhaps X consists of m benzene and?? No., bromine decolouration requires addition. Thus..:

Alternatively, think about other unsaturated compounds. Maybe dienes. If mixture X is of 1,4-pentadiene and 1-pentene. That is not likely. The problem states there's no conjugated bonds. So maybe methylcyclohexene and cyclohexene. Either that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is bmx of cyclohexene and another cyclohexene’s isomer. An alternative construction.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referencing acid-catalyzed dienol... but maybe key is, Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), hydrogenated product. Hence, original X and Y' components must contain rings, when hydrogenated.

If I proceed with the cyclohexene assumption. Start with X: cyclohexene (decays bromine, hydrogenates to cyclohexane) and another component. The other component in X must be something that hydrogenates to cyclohexane as well. Thus,

Wait the problem states that Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids formed by disproportionation. Since Y gives only Z upon hydrogenation, but Z is a component of Y (so after formation, one component is Z, another which hydrogenates to Z). So cyclohexane (Z) and benzene. Then X, when hydrogenated under severe conditions (which would plow through any double bonds), would produce only Z, cyclohexane. For this to be, X's components have to hydrogenate (each) to cyclohexane. Might X contain cyclohexene and benzene? But benzene does not decolorize bromine. We know X does.So X must consist of two different alkenes, each of which can be hydrogenated into cyclohexane.

Ah, wait. If we have two dienes? For example, two isomeric non-conjugated dienes in X. Hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. When heated with platinum, they would redistribute. But I need specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the components could be methylenecyclohexane (spiran) and vinylcyclopentane. Or some terpenes.

Alternatively, since the hydrogenation product is only cyclohexane, which requires that each component must form a six-carbon cycloalkane upon hydrogenation. Therefore, each component of X and the components of Y (excluding Z which doesn't need hydrogenation) must a six-membered cycloalkyl group with unsaturation. So perhaps X contains cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated). But the recipe goereds for X is no conjugattion. So if mixture X contains 1,2-dialkene but do se.

Wait, getting stuck here we might need to think again. Given that the problem says X is a mixture that discolorizes bromine, so alkenes, opening up to bromine via addition. Upon Pt, they process into a mixture Y (Equi, two liquids, including Z=cyclohexane). So probably Y is benzene and cyclohexane. Mixture X is cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene? No, since the cyclohexadiene would create conjugation, which the problem for X disallows. Wait, cyclohexene is zero conjugation. But to X beTwo isomeric of cyclohexene. But in that case, both would hydrogenate to cyclohexane, and when Pi with same loactions do.

Alternatively, look at other types of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Could X be cyclohexene and an alkyne, perhaps 1-hexyne. But when you hydrogenate an alkyne to alkane, you get hexane. but Z is cyclohexane, so that won’t work ordeals. Got vi benlin these caveats.

Alternatively, possible that X is mixture of two enjoined rings with separate double bonds, say bicyclo structures. For example, norbornene (a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure with a double bond). Hydrogenating norbornene gives norbornane, which isn't cyclohexane, so no. Alternatively, maybe the double bonds are in different positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem follows a classic example of 1,4-dihydronaphthalene and bicyclo structures… but murky.

Wait, upon rehashing the data:

1. Mixture X: equimolar two liquids, both decolorize bromine → likely alkenes/alkynes, not conjugated (per problem’s hint)
2. Treated with platinum with heat, allowing disproportionation (possibly dehydrogenerating one and hydrogenating another, transfer of H2 between molecules)
3. Forms Y: equimolar two liquids, no bromine decolouration → both saturated (or aromatic)
4. Both X and Y hydrogenate (severe conditions) to Z = cyclohexane (14.28% H: fits C6H12)
5. Z is part of Y: Z is one component of mixture Y; thus, Y is cyclohexane and something else (say, benzene), as hydrogenating cyclohexane would yield no change (already saturated) and hydrogenating benzene (in severe conditions) gives cyclohexane. So Y would be 50-50 Cyclohexane and benzene.

Therefore, if Y is cyclohexane and benzene, then H2 under harsh conditions for the mixture hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane. Hence, the reactant X becomes the parent need breakdown to give Y's components. Then, the composition of X must be molecules that when undergo Pt-catalyzed disproportionation produce C6H12 and C6H6. What are those molecules. Suppose X is cyclohexene and another cyclohexene. Let then,

2 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H8 (But C6H8 could be cyclohexadiene, but proximity to grind, but problem states Y can't decolorize bromine, so not formed). If C6H8 further dehydrote, benzene C6H6. Wait, but this displaces multiple H2. Thus, three C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6 + 4 H2, but slivovitz... The Yield molar equivalent- user the Problem states Y is equimolar two components and started with X equimolar. So let us initial proportionality.

Suppose that two moles of X's components (two liquids; say, cyclohexene and some other) yields one mole each of cyclohexane and benzene.

Let’s do stoichiometry. When cyclohexene (C6H10):

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 -> not exactly, but we can consider each molecule.

React how?

Suppose that. Considering  in the presence Pt, cyclohexene dimerizes or disproportionation. But maybe each cake reformed; otherwise, r ipe Pinoli.

Alternatively, cross-disproportionation. For example, mix ture balance between dehydrogenation and hydrogenation: if X contains 1,3-cyclohexadiene (non-conjugated, but when tight, but he problem said No conjugated bonds )

Wait maybe X is not two different compounds but isomers of each.

Alternatively, meta-conversion of such. Suppose X is a mixture of vinylic cyclohexane (substituted cyclohexane with a double bond somewhere) leading to the formation of cyclohexane and benzene.

In a more holistic arrest, given time constraints and enumerated steps:

Let me think critically.

Hydrocarbon Z is 14.28% H by mass, we know Z is cyclohexane (C6H12).

Given mixture X is two liquids, which when mixed together are responsible for discoloring bromine (each has a double bond?),  Hydrogenation leads to Z. This implies that X is two different alkenes (since they decolorize bromine), both of which when hydrogenated (even if they have different structures) give cyclohexane.

So equivalently, perhaps both alkenes in X are carbocyclic six-membered rings with a different double bond position.

Alternatively, one could be cyclohexene and another a bicyclic alkene that, upon hydrogenation, breaks a ring to form cyclohexane.

Wait, another angle: if Z is cyclohexane, unsaturated compounds may wrestle círculos Askari, say Qate directly when hydrogenated yield cyclohexane. Hence, the alkenes must be in such a way that hydrogenation converts rings or structures to cyclohexane.

Or they’re methylcyclopentenes. For instance, methylcyclopentene on hydrogenation would give methylcyclopentane.—but harden won't be cyclohexane perhaps. Not quite.

Alternatively, hangting solution elsewhere.

Standard reaction where two brackets mix components which hydrogenate to cyclohexane is maybe:

Mixture X: cyclopentene and cycloheptene.

Hydrogenating cyclopentene (C5H8) gives cyclopentane, which is not Z

Similarly, hydrogenating cycloheptene would give cycloheptane.

Unable as then Z has to be two different alkanes.

Thus I must revert.

Alternatively, maybe neither Norker there, considering different sources bracket.

But if cyclohexene hidrogenated to cyclohexane, does that for sure. If another componentd=, say, benzene, people air the X? But benzene is not decomposing bromine—the problem指出Production=X has decays that decolorize bromide, which benzene unter normal conditions does not. X likely hon two alkenes likelyئانس.

The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. 

1. **Identification of Z**: The hydrocarbon Z, formed by hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y, is cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂) because its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28% (12/84 ≈ 14.28%).

2. **Composition of Mixtures**:
   - **Mixture Y** is an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane (Z) and benzene (C₆H₆). Benzene does not decolorize bromine water but requires severe conditions to hydrogenate to cyclohexane.
   - **Mixture X** must contain substances that decolorize bromine water, indicating unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes). The reaction with platinum (disproportionation) converts these into cyclohexane and benzene.

3. **Components of Mixture X**:
   - The components of X are cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and benzene. However, benzene does not decolorize bromine, so the correct components must be cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) and another non-conjugated alkene. Detailed analysis shows that cyclohexene can disproportionate into cyclohexane and benzene, which aligns with the problem conditions.

4. **Hydrogen Atoms Calculation**:
   - Cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀) has 10 hydrogen atoms.
   - Another alkene (ideally another cyclohexene isomer, non-conjugated, also with 10 hydrogen atoms).

**Total Hydrogen Atoms**: Each component in mixture X (two molecules of cyclohexene or equivalent isomers) has 10 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids is:

\boxed{20}

Wait, but Z is cyclohexane. If Y had benzene and cyclohexane, hydrogenating benzene to cyclohexane would require additional hydrogen, but if Y already contains cyclohexane:\n\nHowever, the problem states hydrogenation of Y yields Z (cyclohexane), implying benzene (in Y) hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But mix Y equimolar cyclohexane + benzene; hydrogenating benzene to cyclohexane would make excess cyclohexane. But during hydrogenation of mixture X, which comprises two unsaturated components, upon hydrogenation gives entirely Z=cyclohexane.\n\nPerhaps in X, we have 2 cyclohexene isomers that don’t have conjugated bonds, such as cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (but the latter\'s still conjugated). Wait, but the problem says there\'s NO conjugated multiple bonds. So individual molecules cannot have conjugated double bonds, but mixture can have separate compounds. So maybe cyclohexene (monoene) and another cyclohexene with another isolated double bond? Impossible in cyclohexene, but perhaps a different molecule.\n\nAlternatively, in mixture X, perhaps we have two cyclohexenes with different positions that are not conjugated. Hmm.\n\nBut working backwards, since Y is formed by disproportionation of X. Disproportionation - perhaps the reaction is an olefin metathesis, which is not. Platinum. Dehydrogenation. Alternatively: heat with platinum decomposes.\n\nWait, Platinum as a catalyst. For example, arene (benzene) can be obtained from cyclohexane via dehydrogenation, using platinum as the catalyst. But for cyclohexene, heating with Pt might cause some dehydrogenation. Let\'s think.\n\nIf the starting mixture X, composed perhaps of something that when platinum is added, they undergo disproportionation. The assumption is perhaps that cyclohexene (in X) upon heating with Pt would yield cyclohexane and benzene via dehydrogenation (benzene would require extensive dehydrogenation). But going from cyclohexene to benzene and cyclohexane:\n\nIf three cyclohexene molecules disproportionate: 3 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6 ? But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider cyclohexene undergoing hydrogen transfer:\n\nHow would X (which are unsaturated → alkenes) when heated with Pt would form Y (saturated + more saturated?).\n\nAlternatively, dehydrohalogenation/cleavage. Rather, perhaps through a Diels-Alder-like reaction? Disproportionation perhaps could involve:\n\nIf molecule transfers hydrogen from one to another, perhaps one becomes more saturated (cyclohexane), the other becomes a diene? But question states mixture Y comprises two liquids that don\'t decolorize bromine, so both must be saturated. Alternatively, if X is cyclohexene and a diene (without conjugation in each molecule).\n\nBut mixture X solves as two non-conjugated alkenes. Pt heating causes dehydrogenation of one and hydrogenation of another. If we have some system where one part has (plural) unsaturation. This is getting a bit complicated, let me try again.\n\nGiven that Z, cyclohexane, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, means X must be cyclohexene and some other olefin that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. Wait, cyclohexene plus cyclohexadiene (which on hydrogenation would turn into cyclohexane). But to link it to Y composition.\n\nAlternatively, think that mixture X contained cyclohexene (C6H10) and benzene(C6H6). But benzene won\'t decolorize bromine under normal conditions, so that\'s not it. If X decolorizes bromine, benzene wouldn’t.\n\nAlternatively, cyclohexene and another structral isomer ?\n\nWait, perhaps mix X is composed of cyclohexane and cyclohexene, but they don\'t decolorize bromine water? But cyclohexene does. So the two in X must both decolorize bromine water, so cyclohexene (which does) and perhaps another diene.\n\nAlternatively, if X is a mixture of 1,3-pentadiene and 1,4-pentadiene. But the main point is how this would react.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps X is penta-1,3-diene and another, but these are conjugated? Wait, the problem states that their molecules don\'t have conjugated multiple bonds, so each molecule must have isolated double bonds.\n\nFor example, 1,4-pentadiene or cyclooctene (mono-ene), etc. But both possibly not.\n\nWait, but after hydrogenation, it\'s cyclohexane (C6H12). But if hydrogenating X or Y yields only cyclohexane, then X must consist of C5 or C6 hydrocarbons? Wait, maybe X comprises hexenes.\n\nIf X consists of cyclohexene and another alkene. For example, cyclohexene and hex-1-ene. If they hydrogenate to cyclohexane (maybe not). However, cyclohexene + 1-hexene hydrogenating would cyclohexane + hexane. Not same as Z. Hence, must have all elements that hydrogenate to same C6H12.\n\nThis implies original X contains alkenes which, when hydrogenated, become C6H12. But cyclohexene (C6H10) → C6H12. But another component would  after hydrogenation does. If that component is cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then hydrogenation to C6H12. Therefore, if X is mixtures of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene (isolated dienes), but the molecule structure is such that each diene in X is non-conjugated.\n\nBut the problem statement indicates no conjugated. If cyclohexadiene with isolated double bonds, possibly.\n\nIf so, their mixture X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene. Upon treatment with Pt, after heating, they undergo disproportionation. Disproportionation usually transfers hydrogens.\n\nFor example:1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10) may exchange H, so that the mixture Y becomes cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). Benzene would require extensive dehydrogenation.\n\nBut Y must be transparent to bromine water so the components in Y would be saturated or aromatic. Benzene (which doesn\'t react with bromine) and cyclohexane used. But cyclohexane would float in bromine water but no decolorization. So If X is treated with Pt and heated to give Y (cyclohexane and benzene), and hydrogenating Y would yield again cyclohexane (asZ).\n\nHowever, benzene in Y would require 3 hydrogen moles to hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But mix Y\'s hydrogenation under severe conditions yields Z (cyclohexane). Also, cyclohexane, which is Z, is already present in Y. Hence, after hydrogenation of Y (which includes cyclohexane and benzene), we would get cyclohexane (no change) and cyclohexane (from benzene). Hence, resulting in only cyclohexane. So that makes sense.\n\nIf starting with Y that is benzene and cyclohexane, heating under H2 with Pt will hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane. Then Y\'s hydrogenation gives all cyclohexane. Similarly, hydrogenation of X (cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene) would of course hydrogenate cyclohexadiene (C6H8 → C6H12) and cyclohexene (C6H10 → C6H12) ; similarly, their hydrogenation gives entirely cyclohexane. Hence, Z is cyclohexane.\n\nThus, fitting these conditions.\n\nBut hang on, the problem states that no conjugation is in X. So molecules in X can’t have conjugated double bonds. If mixture X comprises 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated), which would contravene the problem\'s stipulation. Alternatively, if mixture X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (isolated double bonds) and cyclohexene, ic. which would satisfy \'no conjugated\'.\n\nHence, per:\n\nX is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10), equimolar. Adding platinum with heat, these would undergo disproportionation. Hypothetically, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene transfers H to cyclohexene, becoming benzene (C6H6) and the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane (C6H12). Hence Y would be benzene and cyclohexane (equimolar). After hydrogenation, hydrogenating benzene in Y would yield cyclohexane and the pre-existing cyclohexane, getting pure Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenating X\'s cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene would likewise become cyclohexane.\n\nThis logic holds up thus:\n\n- X: equimolar 1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene (both alkenes, not conjugated within the molecule)\n- Disproportionation via Pt/heat: hydrogenation and dehydrogenation occurs. Assume each molecule donates or accepts H. So 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) fully dehydrogenates to benzene (C6H6), must lose 4H (cyclohexadiene C6H8 → benzene C6H6 + 2H2 ? Or let’s balance the equations.)\n\nAlternatively, the reaction pathways could be:\n\nTaking an example of disproportionation using models:\n\nSuppose:\n\nCyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10) react, transferring hydrogen. If one molecule loses H (dehydrogenation) and another gains (hydrogenation):\n\nAssume, for every n, partial transfer.\n\nFor concept:\n\nEach 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) →  benzene (C6H6) + H2.\n\nEach cyclohexene (C6H10) → cyclohexane (C6H12) - requires adding H2.\n\nBut overall, in a disproportionation, E.g.:\n\nAssume two molecules: one acting as hydrogen donor (which gets oxidized) and another as receiver (reduced).\n\nThe 1,4-cyclohexadiene (having two double bonds) loses H to become benzene, effectively donating two H2 molecules:\n\nC6H8 → C6H6 + H2\n\nCyclohexene (C6H10) absorbs one H2 to become cyclohexane:\n\nC6H10 + H2 → C6H12\n\nHence, overall, transfer of H from one molecule to another.\n\nFor a stoichiometric reaction:\n\nTotal H2 generated by cyclohexadiene: 1 mol C6H8 → 1 mol C6H6 + 1 mol H2.\n\nTo utilize the H2, perhaps 1 mol C6H10 +1 mol H2 →1 mol C6H12.\n\nSince in a mixture taken equimolar quantities:\n\n1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10) in 1:1 ratio, reacting to form:\n\n1 mol benzene (C6H6) from the cyclohexadiene,\n\nand 1 mol cyclohexane (C6H12) from the cyclohexene.\n\nHence, equimolar mixture Y would be benzene and cyclohexane.\n\nBut benzene doesn\'t decolorize bromine, true enough. Check ok.\n\nHydrogenation of Y (benzene and cyclohexane) would convert benzene to cyclohexane, sum totals remain only cyclohexane. Similarly, hydrogenation of X (cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene) would produce cyclohexane (C6H12 (from C6H8 + 2H2) +C6H10 + H2 →C6H12. So both components of X require 3mol H2, but if X is equimolar:\n\nEach mol cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → C6H12 (needs 2mol H2),\nEach mol cyclohexene (C6H10) → C6H12 (needs 1mol H2),\nTotally, per mole of each, 3mol H2.\n\nOverall, validates blow.\n\nThe question\'s point 3 states that hydrogenation under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane), which is an component of Y and widely used as a solvent. Plus, Z is a constituent of Y (cyclohexane is). Ok.\n\nHence the compounds:\n\nIn mixture X: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): hydrogen count → 8 H\n\nAnd Cyclohexene (C6H10): hydrogen count →10 H\n\nWait. The problem asks for the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of X. \n\nIf the two chemicals in X are 1,4-cyclohexadiene C6H8 (which has 8 H) and cyclohexene C6H10 (10 H):\n\nThe total number per molecule. Unless there\'s a different structure. Wait, check number of H atoms:\n\n1 mol of C6H8 would contain 8 H,\n\n1 mol of C6H10 contains 10 H.\n\nAssuming mixture X is equimolar.\n\n\nBut wait, not per molecule, but each molecule. The question is total H atoms in the two liquids. But interpreting the problem.\n\nLiteral reading: each component 1 contributes a certain number of H atoms, component 2 another. If mixture X is two liquids, "each" has a certain number of H atoms. Then the total sum when their H atoms are added. So, in mixture X\'s two components, each molecule\'s H count is summed and added for the answer.\n\nIf components are cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10) → each has 8 and 10 H atoms. Total is 18 hydrogen atoms in the two molecules from mixture X.\n\nBut answer checking whether sum of H atoms per molecules is 8+10=18. But this is per two molecules (one of each). Hence, the answer should be 18? But perhaps the fluorophores structure may be different.\n\nBut possibility other than C6H8? Let’s consider other molecules. Suppose they are cyclic dienes but perhaps all in cyclohexane environment, maybe one mono-ene and other with substituents. Or maybe exist in ring structures. Let\'s but check whether C6H8 and C6H10 would be correct.\n\nIf the H count per original X components is 8 and 10 each. But let me confirm:\n\nFor cyclohexene (one double bond), would formula be C6H10. If the ring is part of the formula; six carbons, one double bond would have CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH2 or cyclohexene, which has formula C6H10.\n\nA cyclohexane is C6H12. Each double bond removes two H, cyclohexene:12-2=10, yes. If the cyclohexadiene is (1,4) which has two double bonds: two less H, so cyclohexane -4H →C6H8.\n\nCorrect. So X contains C6H8 and C6H10. Each molecule has 8 and 10 H atoms.\n\nHence, in each molecule, H counts are 8 and 10, summing 18. Hence the answer 8 +10 =18. Which implies total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.\n\nBUT question states: "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X".\n\nC6H8 and C6H10 consist each molecule having 8 and 10 H atoms. Hence, answer is 8 +10=18. Need to verify.\n\nBut whether I made a mistake here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, possibilities involving benzene + something else, but previously ruled out. Let\'s recertify.\n\nBut wait, another way. Let\'s suppose if X is 1,3-cyclopentadiene and another alkene, but such cyclopentadienes have conjugated bonds. In problem states that no conjugated multiple bonds. Hence my previous code is plausible.\n\nHence the answer should be 8 +10=18, total H atoms. Perhaps 18 is the desired answer；so boxed [\\80×18=WTL? Dstnce?\n\nNoo. Think again, equate per molecule: Each molecule of the two liquids in X has 8 and 10 H atoms. But the problem might refer to per mole. If you need the combined number of H atoms per mole of X mixture.\n\nSince X is equimolar, each mole of X contains 0.5 mol of C6H8 and 0.5 mol of C6H10.\n\nCalculate total H atoms per mole of X:\n\nIn 0.5 mol of C6H8: 0.5 *6.022e23 molecules *8 H/molecule  ⇒ n/a since the question refers to the count per mixture. However, the problem is phrased as:\n\n"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X."\n\nSo per molecule basis. Each component is separate.If the question is simply the sum for each compound. So:\n\nH in first compound:8.\n\nH in second compound:10.\n\nTotal together:18.\n\nHence, answer is 18.

Given an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated compounds (likely alkenes or alkynes without conjugated multiple bonds). Heating mixture X with platinum results in disproportionation, forming an equimolar mixture Y of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water, suggesting they are saturated or aromatic. Hydrogenation of both X and Y yields a single hydrocarbon Z (C₃H₆) with a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, identified as cyclohexane (C₆H₁₂). 

Key steps:
1. **Hydrogen Content Calculation for Z**: 
   - Mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, leading to the molecular formula C₆H₁₂ (cyclohexane).
2. **Disproportionation Reaction**:
   - Mixture X (non-conjugated alkenes) undergoes disproportionation with platinum, forming mixture Y (cyclohexane and benzene).
3. **Hydrogenation**:
   - Hydrogenation of X (cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene) and Y (cyclohexane and benzene) both yield cyclohexane (Z).
4. **Structures of Compounds in X**:
   - Mixture X consists of 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈) and cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀).

**Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**:
- In 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C₆H₈), there are 8 hydrogen atoms per molecule.
- In cyclohexene (C₆H₁₀), there are 10 hydrogen atoms per molecule.
- Summing these gives 8 + 10 = 18 hydrogen atoms.

\boxed{18}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 However, Y’s composition could mix cyclohexane and benzene. Wait, but Z is cyclohexane. If Y had benzene and cyclohexane, hydrogenating benzene to cyclohexane would require additional hydrogen, but if Y already contains cyclohexane:

However, the problem states hydrogenation of Y yields Z (cyclohexane), implying benzene (in Y) hydrogenated to cyclohexane. But mix Y equimolar cyclohexane + benzene; hydrogenating benzene to cyclohexane would make excess cyclohexane. But during hydrogenation of mixture X, which comprises two unsaturated components, upon hydrogenation gives entirely Z=cyclohexane.

Perhaps in X, we have 2 cyclohexene isomers that don’t have conjugated bonds, such as cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (but the latter's still conjugated). Wait, but the problem says there's NO conjugated multiple bonds. So individual molecules cannot have conjugated double bonds, but mixture can have separate compounds. So maybe cyclohexene (monoene) and another cyclohexene with another isolated double bond? Impossible in cyclohexene, but perhaps a different molecule.

Alternatively, in mixture X, perhaps we have two cyclohexenes with different positions that are not conjugated. Hmm.

But working backwards, since Y is formed by disproportionation of X. Disproportionation - perhaps the reaction is an olefin metathesis, which is not. Platinum. Dehydrogenation. Alternatively: heat with platinum decomposes.

Wait, Platinum as a catalyst. For example, arene (benzene) can be obtained from cyclohexane via dehydrogenation, using platinum as the catalyst. But for cyclohexene, heating with Pt might cause some dehydrogenation. Let's think.

If the starting mixture X, composed perhaps of something that when platinum is added, they undergo disproportionation. The assumption is perhaps that cyclohexene (in X) upon heating with Pt would yield cyclohexane and benzene via dehydrogenation (benzene would require extensive dehydrogenation). But going from cyclohexene to benzene and cyclohexane:

If three cyclohexene molecules disproportionate: 3 C6H10 → C6H12 + C6H6 ? But how?

Alternatively, consider cyclohexene undergoing hydrogen transfer:

How would X (which are unsaturated → alkenes) when heated with Pt would form Y (saturated + more saturated?).

Alternatively, dehydrohalogenation/cleavage. Rather, perhaps through a Diels-Alder-like reaction? Disproportionation perhaps could involve:

If molecule transfers hydrogen from one to another, perhaps one becomes more saturated (cyclohexane), the other becomes a diene? But question states mixture Y comprises two liquids that don't decolorize bromine, so both must be saturated. Alternatively, if X is cyclohexene and a diene (without conjugation in each molecule).

But mixture X solves as two non-conjugated alkenes. Pt heating causes dehydrogenation of one and hydrogenation of another. If we have some system where one part has (plural) unsaturation. This is getting a bit complicated, let me try again.

Given that Z, cyclohexane, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z, means X must be cyclohexene and some other olefin that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. Wait, cyclohexene plus cyclohexadiene (which on hydrogenation would turn into cyclohexane). But to link it to Y composition.

Alternatively, think that mixture X contained cyclohexene (C6H10) and benzene(C6H6). But benzene won't decolorize bromine under normal conditions, so that's not it. If X decolorizes bromine, benzene wouldn’t.

Alternatively, cyclohexene and another structral isomer ?

Wait, perhaps mix X is composed of cyclohexane and cyclohexene, but they don't decolorize bromine water? But cyclohexene does. So the two in X must both decolorize bromine water, so cyclohexene (which does) and perhaps another diene.

Alternatively, if X is a mixture of 1,3-pentadiene and 1,4-pentadiene. But the main point is how this would react.

Alternatively, perhaps X is penta-1,3-diene and another, but these are conjugated? Wait, the problem states that their molecules don't have conjugated multiple bonds, so each molecule must have isolated double bonds.

For example, 1,4-pentadiene or cyclooctene (mono-ene), etc. But both possibly not.

Wait, but after hydrogenation, it's cyclohexane (C6H12). But if hydrogenating X or Y yields only cyclohexane, then X must consist of C5 or C6 hydrocarbons? Wait, maybe X comprises hexenes.

If X consists of cyclohexene and another alkene. For example, cyclohexene and hex-1-ene. If they hydrogenate to cyclohexane (maybe not). However, cyclohexene + 1-hexene hydrogenating would cyclohexane + hexane. Not same as Z. Hence, must have all elements that hydrogenate to same C6H12.

This implies original X contains alkenes which, when hydrogenated, become C6H12. But cyclohexene (C6H10) → C6H12. But another component would  after hydrogenation does. If that component is cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then hydrogenation to C6H12. Therefore, if X is mixtures of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene (isolated dienes), but the molecule structure is such that each diene in X is non-conjugated.

But the problem statement indicates no conjugated. If cyclohexadiene with isolated double bonds, possibly.

If so, their mixture X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene. Upon treatment with Pt, after heating, they undergo disproportionation. Disproportionation usually transfers hydrogens.

For example:1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10) may exchange H, so that the mixture Y becomes cyclohexane (C6H12) and benzene (C6H6). Benzene would require extensive dehydrogenation.

But Y must be transparent to bromine water so the components in Y would be saturated or aromatic. Benzene (which doesn't react with bromine) and cyclohexane used. But cyclohexane would float in bromine water but no decolorization. So If X is treated with Pt and heated to give Y (cyclohexane and benzene), and hydrogenating Y would yield again cyclohexane (asZ).

However, benzene in Y would require 3 hydrogen moles to hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But mix Y's hydrogenation under severe conditions yields Z (cyclohexane). Also, cyclohexane, which is Z, is already present in Y. Hence, after hydrogenation of Y (which includes cyclohexane and benzene), we would get cyclohexane (no change) and cyclohexane (from benzene). Hence, resulting in only cyclohexane. So that makes sense.

If starting with Y that is benzene and cyclohexane, heating under H2 with Pt will hydrogenate benzene to cyclohexane. Then Y's hydrogenation gives all cyclohexane. Similarly, hydrogenation of X (cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene) would of course hydrogenate cyclohexadiene (C6H8 → C6H12) and cyclohexene (C6H10 → C6H12) ; similarly, their hydrogenation gives entirely cyclohexane. Hence, Z is cyclohexane.

Thus, fitting these conditions.

But hang on, the problem states that no conjugation is in X. So molecules in X can’t have conjugated double bonds. If mixture X comprises 1,3-cyclohexadiene (conjugated), which would contravene the problem's stipulation. Alternatively, if mixture X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (isolated double bonds) and cyclohexene, ic. which would satisfy 'no conjugated'.

Hence, per:

X is 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10), equimolar. Adding platinum with heat, these would undergo disproportionation. Hypothetically, 1,4-Cyclohexadiene transfers H to cyclohexene, becoming benzene (C6H6) and the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane (C6H12). Hence Y would be benzene and cyclohexane (equimolar). After hydrogenation, hydrogenating benzene in Y would yield cyclohexane and the pre-existing cyclohexane, getting pure Z (cyclohexane). Hydrogenating X's cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene would likewise become cyclohexane.

This logic holds up thus:

- X: equimolar 1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene (both alkenes, not conjugated within the molecule)
- Disproportionation via Pt/heat: hydrogenation and dehydrogenation occurs. Assume each molecule donates or accepts H. So 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) fully dehydrogenates to benzene (C6H6), must lose 4H (cyclohexadiene C6H8 → benzene C6H6 + 2H2 ? Or let’s balance the equations.)

Alternatively, the reaction pathways could be:

Taking an example of disproportionation using models:

Suppose:

Cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10) react, transferring hydrogen. If one molecule loses H (dehydrogenation) and another gains (hydrogenation):

Assume, for every n, partial transfer.

For concept:

Each 1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) →  benzene (C6H6) + H2.

Each cyclohexene (C6H10) → cyclohexane (C6H12) - requires adding H2.

But overall, in a disproportionation, E.g.:

Assume two molecules: one acting as hydrogen donor (which gets oxidized) and another as receiver (reduced).

The 1,4-cyclohexadiene (having two double bonds) loses H to become benzene, effectively donating two H2 molecules:

C6H8 → C6H6 + H2

Cyclohexene (C6H10) absorbs one H2 to become cyclohexane:

C6H10 + H2 → C6H12

Hence, overall, transfer of H from one molecule to another.

For a stoichiometric reaction:

Total H2 generated by cyclohexadiene: 1 mol C6H8 → 1 mol C6H6 + 1 mol H2.

To utilize the H2, perhaps 1 mol C6H10 +1 mol H2 →1 mol C6H12.

Since in a mixture taken equimolar quantities:

1,4-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10) in 1:1 ratio, reacting to form:

1 mol benzene (C6H6) from the cyclohexadiene,

and 1 mol cyclohexane (C6H12) from the cyclohexene.

Hence, equimolar mixture Y would be benzene and cyclohexane.

But benzene doesn't decolorize bromine, true enough. Check ok.

Hydrogenation of Y (benzene and cyclohexane) would convert benzene to cyclohexane, sum totals remain only cyclohexane. Similarly, hydrogenation of X (cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene) would produce cyclohexane (C6H12 (from C6H8 + 2H2) +C6H10 + H2 →C6H12. So both components of X require 3mol H2, but if X is equimolar:

Each mol cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → C6H12 (needs 2mol H2),
Each mol cyclohexene (C6H10) → C6H12 (needs 1mol H2),
Totally, per mole of each, 3mol H2.

Overall, validates blow.

The question's point 3 states that hydrogenation under severe conditions gives only Z (cyclohexane), which is an component of Y and widely used as a solvent. Plus, Z is a constituent of Y (cyclohexane is). Ok.

Hence the compounds:

In mixture X: 1,4-Cyclohexadiene (C6H8): hydrogen count → 8 H

And Cyclohexene (C6H10): hydrogen count →10 H

Wait. The problem asks for the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of X. 

If the two chemicals in X are 1,4-cyclohexadiene C6H8 (which has 8 H) and cyclohexene C6H10 (10 H):

The total number per molecule. Unless there's a different structure. Wait, check number of H atoms:

1 mol of C6H8 would contain 8 H,

1 mol of C6H10 contains 10 H.

Assuming mixture X is equimolar.


But wait, not per molecule, but each molecule. The question is total H atoms in the two liquids. But interpreting the problem.

Literal reading: each component 1 contributes a certain number of H atoms, component 2 another. If mixture X is two liquids, "each" has a certain number of H atoms. Then the total sum when their H atoms are added. So, in mixture X's two components, each molecule's H count is summed and added for the answer.

If components are cyclohexadiene (C6H8) and cyclohexene (C6H10) → each has 8 and 10 H atoms. Total is 18 hydrogen atoms in the two molecules from mixture X.

But answer checking whether sum of H atoms per molecules is 8+10=18. But this is per two molecules (one of each). Hence, the answer should be 18? But perhaps the fluorophores structure may be different.

But possibility other than C6H8? Let’s consider other molecules. Suppose they are cyclic dienes but perhaps all in cyclohexane environment, maybe one mono-ene and other with substituents. Or maybe exist in ring structures. Let's but check whether C6H8 and C6H10 would be correct.

If the H count per original X components is 8 and 10 each. But let me confirm:

For cyclohexene (one double bond), would formula be C6H10. If the ring is part of the formula; six carbons, one double bond would have CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH2 or cyclohexene, which has formula C6H10.

A cyclohexane is C6H12. Each double bond removes two H, cyclohexene:12-2=10, yes. If the cyclohexadiene is (1,4) which has two double bonds: two less H, so cyclohexane -4H →C6H8.

Correct. So X contains C6H8 and C6H10. Each molecule has 8 and 10 H atoms.

Hence, in each molecule, H counts are 8 and 10, summing 18. Hence the answer 8 +10 =18. Which implies total number of hydrogen atoms is 18.

BUT question states: "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X".

C6H8 and C6H10 consist each molecule having 8 and 10 H atoms. Hence, answer is 8 +10=18. Need to verify.

But whether I made a mistake here. Hmm.

Alternatively, possibilities involving benzene + something else, but previously ruled out. Let's recertify.

But wait, another way. Let's suppose if X is 1,3-cyclopentadiene and another alkene, but such cyclopentadienes have conjugated bonds. In problem states that no conjugated multiple bonds. Hence my previous code is plausible.

Hence the answer should be 8 +10=18, total H atoms. Perhaps 18 is the desired answer；so boxed [\80×18=WTL? Dstnce?

Noo. Think again, equate per molecule: Each molecule of the two liquids in X has 8 and 10 H atoms. But the problem might refer to per mole. If you need the combined number of H atoms per mole of X mixture.

Since X is equimolar, each mole of X contains 0.5 mol of C6H8 and 0.5 mol of C6H10.

Calculate total H atoms per mole of X:

In 0.5 mol of C6H8: 0.5 *6.022e23 molecules *8 H/molecule  ⇒ n/a since the question refers to the count per mixture. However, the problem is phrased as:

"total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X."

So per molecule basis. Each component is separate.If the question is simply the sum for each compound. So:

H in first compound:8.

H in second compound:10.

Total together:18.

Hence, answer is 18. Therefore, I think the answer is 18.

They ask for sum of hydrogen atoms in two liquids, likely indicates per molecules not per mole.

Wait, but why is draw Seinan clearer if the problem mentions the total as if in two molecules. 

Wait,

Mixture X has two liquids. For each of their molecules:

One is C6H8 - each molecule has 8 H.

Other is C6H10 - each has 10 H.

Therefore, sum of H in a molecule of the first and second compound:8+10=18.

Hence, the total number is 18. Therefore, answer is 18.

Yes, I'm confident.

**Final Answer**
The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is \boxed{18}.
