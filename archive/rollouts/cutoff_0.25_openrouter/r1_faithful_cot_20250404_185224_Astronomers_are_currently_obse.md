# Original Question

Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star (Rₚ/Rₛ) that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the given spot-induced variation, we need to compare the flux variations caused by the spots to the transit depth of an exoplanet.

1. **Flux Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star has one hemisphere with 20% spot coverage (filling factor) and an effective temperature (T_eff) of 6000 K.
   - The spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K.
   - The flux from the unspotted hemisphere (F_max) is calculated using T_eff.
   - The flux from the spotted hemisphere (F_min) is calculated by considering 80% of the hemisphere at T_eff and 20% at T_spot.

   The relative flux variation is given by:
   \[
   \frac{F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \left(1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right)
   \]
   Substituting the temperatures:
   \[
   \frac{F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \left(1 - \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4\right)
   \]
   Calculating the values:
   \[
   \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.482
   \]
   \[
   \frac{F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}}{F_{\text{max}}} = 0.2 \left(1 - 0.482\right) = 0.2 \times 0.518 = 0.1036
   \]

2. **Equating to Exoplanet Transit Depth**:
   - The transit depth caused by an exoplanet is \((\frac{R_p}{R_s})^2\).
   - Setting this equal to the flux variation:
   \[
   \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 = 0.1036
   \]
   Solving for \(R_p/R_s\):
   \[
   \frac{R_p}{R_s} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.32
   \]

Thus, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is \(\boxed{0.32}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the scenario is that astronomers are observing a star like the Sun, but one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of it. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, as the star rotates, we'll see periodic brightness changes. The question is asking: if we were to explain this same brightness variation using an exoplanet transit instead of spots, what size would the planet need to be relative to the star?

Hmm, so essentially, they want to equate the light loss from the spots to the light loss from a transiting exoplanet. So, we need to calculate the fraction of light blocked by the spots and then find what size planet would block the same fraction.

First, let's think about the spots. The star has one hemisphere with spots covering 20% of its area. Wait, so if the radius is the same as the Sun, that's just for reference. The key here is that one hemisphere (half the surface area) is 20% covered in spots. Wait, or is the filling factor of 20% on the entire star? Wait, the problem says "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so on the one hemisphere, 20% of that hemisphere's area is covered by spots. So the total spotted area is 20% of half the star's surface. Therefore, total spotted area is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4πR²) = 0.1 * 4πR²? No, wait, surface area of a hemisphere is 2πR² (since the total surface area is 4πR², each hemisphere is 2πR²). So 20% of 2πR² is 0.4πR². Wait no, 20% of the hemisphere’s area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So total spotted area is 0.4πR². But the entire surface area is 4πR², so this spot is covering 10% of the whole star. Wait, 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered with spots. But hang on, the filling factor is a measure of the fraction of the stellar surface covered by spots. Maybe here it's just saying that on one hemisphere, the filling factor is 20%, meaning 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So total filling factor over the entire star is 10%? Maybe. So filling factor is the fraction of the visible surface covered by spots. But for the rotational modulation, it's about the projected area as the star rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots block some light, and when it's facing away, we see the full brightness. So the variation in brightness comes from the difference between the spotted hemisphere being in view versus the unspotted hemisphere. Wait, but if the spots are only on one hemisphere, is it always there, but as the star rotates, the spots rotate in and out of view? No, if the spots are only on one hemisphere, and the rotation is such that we see that hemisphere and then the other. But in this case, the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered with spots, implying that half the star is spotty, but not in the sense that all spots are on one side; but rather, in one hemisphere, some portion (20%) is covered with spots, and the other hemisphere is clear.

Wait, maybe actually understanding the geometry here is key. Let me parse the problem again. "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So a hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. A filling factor of 20% on that hemisphere means that 20% of that hemisphere's area is covered by spots. Therefore, total spot coverage is 20% of 0.5, which is 10% of the entire stellar surface. Wait, so 20% of the hemisphere's area, so 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, so 10%?

So spots cover 10% of the star's surface. But how does that affect the brightness?

But first, the star's luminosity is determined by its effective temperature. But the spots are cooler, so they emit less light. The flux from a star is proportional to its surface area times the flux per unit area, which is sigma*T^4. So the total flux from the star would be (unspotted area * T_eff^4 + spotted area * T_spot^4) * sigma. However, since the star is rotating and only the hemisphere with spots is contributing less flux when that hemisphere is facing us. Wait, no. Wait, in this setup, the star's spots are distributed on one hemisphere. But unless the star is rotating, it's just that when the spotted hemisphere is in view, we see the dark spots, and when it's not, we don't. Wait, but in reality, stars are rotating, so over time, as the star spins, different parts come into view. So the light curve would have maximum brightness when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. Therefore, the amplitude of variation would be the difference in flux between the two hemispheres divided by the average flux.

But the problem says "photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation." Meaning, when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, they block some light, so the flux drops. The key point is that the spots only cover part of the star's surface, so when that part is facing us, the total flux is lower. Therefore, the amplitude of the variation is determined by the difference in flux between the spotted hemisphere being visible versus not.

Alternatively, maybe the effective temperature is the average temperature of the star, as measured by its total luminosity. So the presence of spots reduces the overall luminosity, but since they are only on one hemisphere, the observed flux would vary as the star rotates because sometimes we see more spots, sometimes fewer.

Wait, actually, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we observe less flux from the star, and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, we see more flux. So the flux would oscillate between these two extremes. To compute the amplitude, we need to calculate the maximum flux (unspotted half) and minimum flux (spotted half). Then the amplitude would be (F_max - F_min)/(F_max + F_min) ?

Wait, actually, for a periodic variation, the amplitude is typically referred to as the relative change in brightness. For transiting exoplanets, the depth of the transit is (Rp/Rs)^2, where Rp is planet radius and Rs is star radius. So similar here, the brightness variation would be due to the contrast between the spotted and unspotted regions. So, when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is lower; when it rotates out, the flux increases.

Therefore, first, we need to calculate the luminosity from the unspotted hemisphere: which is the area of the unspotted hemisphere times the flux per unit area (sigma*T_eff^4). Then, the spotted hemisphere has 20% coverage with T_spot = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K, and the remaining 80% of the hemisphere is at Teff =6000K. Then, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux would be (0.8 * sigma*T_eff^4 + 0.2 * sigma*T_spot^4) multiplied by the area of half the star? Wait, hemisphere is half the surface area. So total flux when unspotted hemisphere is facing us is (0.5*4πR²)*sigma*T_eff^4 / (4πd²) where d is the distance. But maybe we can work with relative fluxes.

Alternatively, let's just consider the flux from each hemisphere. The total flux from the star when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is (0.5 * 4πR²) * sigma*T_eff^4 / (4πd²) = (0.5 * R² * sigma*T_eff^4 ) / d². Similarly, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is (0.8 * 0.5 *4πR² * sigma*T_eff^4 + 0.2 *0.5*4πR²*sigma*(5000)^4)/4πd². So simplifying, when unspotted: F_unspotted = 0.5 * (R^2 / d^2) * sigma*T_eff^4.

When spotted: F_spotted = 0.5*(R^2 / d^2)*sigma*(0.8*T_eff^4 + 0.2*T_spot^4)

So the difference in flux is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 0.5*(R^2 / d^2)*sigma* [ T_eff^4 - (0.8*T_eff^4 + 0.2*T_spot^4) ] = 0.5*(R^2 / d^2)*sigma* [ 0.2*(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ]

The amplitude of the variation would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_average. Wait, maybe not, we need to think about how astronomers observe the light curve.

In transit photometry, the depth is delta F / F = (Rp / R*)^2. Here, in this case, the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is in view, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is in view. So the relative drop in flux would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted. Because when the planet transits, the flux drops by (Rp/R*)^2. So maybe similar here.

Alternatively, the amplitude could be Delta F / F_avg. Let me check.

The contrast between max and min would be (F_max - F_min)/F_avg. Typically, the amplitude is given as (F_max - F_min)/(F_max). Let's be precise.

First, calculate F_max: F_max = 0.5 * sigma*T_eff^4 * (R / d)^2.

F_min = 0.5 * sigma*(0.8*T_eff^4 + 0.2*T_spot^4) * (R / d)^2.

The variation in flux is F_max - F_min = 0.5*sigma*(R/d)^2 * [ T_eff^4 - 0.8*T_eff^4 -0.2*T_spot^4 ] = 0.5*sigma*(R/d)^2 *0.2*(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )

The average flux F_avg when considering the star over a full rotation would be (F_max + F_min)/2.

But we need to compare this amplitude to the transit depth caused by an exoplanet. The transit depth is delta_F / F = (Rp / Rstar)^2.

But what measure of delta_F is equivalent here?

If the variation due to the spots is (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, then to achieve the same amplitude as the transit depth, we set:

(Rp / Rstar)^2 = (F_max - F_min)/F_avg.

Alternatively, if the spots cause a dip in brightness similar to a transit, maybe we need to compute (F_max - F_min)/F_max which is the relative drop, similar to transit depth, where delta_F/F = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So if we calculate (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [0.5 * sigma*(R/d)^2 *0.2*(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / [0.5 * sigma*(R/d)^2*T_eff^4] ] = [0.2*(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)] / T_eff^4 = 0.2*(1 - (T_spot/T_eff)^4 )

Given T_spot is 5000K, T_eff is 6000K. Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482. So 1 - 0.482 = 0.518. Thus, 0.2 * 0.518 ≈ 0.103. So the relative flux drop is about 10.3%. The transit depth delta_F/F_max is approximately 10.3%.

For a planet transit, delta_F/F = (Rp/Rstar)^2. So to have the same depth, we need (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.103. Then Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.103) ≈ 0.321. So approximately 0.32, so about 32% of the star's radius. That would make the planet's radius 0.32 Rstar, so since the star is solar radius, the planet would be about 0.32 Solar radii. But that's a very large planet; Jupiter is about 0.1 Solar radii. Wait, but let me check calculation.

Wait, so step by step again.

Given Teff=6000K, T_spot=5000K. The calculation is:

(5000 /6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747

Multiply by 0.2: 0.517747 * 0.2 ≈ 0.10355. So delta_F / F ≈ 0.10355, so 10.355%.

Thus, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355, so Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3216, so approximately 0.32.

But Jupiter is ~0.1 R_sun, but this would be a planet with 0.32 R_sun. But maybe it's a very large planet or maybe even a star, but in terms of the problem, they are asking for the ratio regardless.

But let me think again if this is correct.

Wait, in the spot scenario, when the spots are in view, the flux is reduced by (delta_F / F_max) = 10.3%, so it's equivalent to a transit depth of 10.3%, then the radius ratio squared is 0.103, so Rp/Rstar = ~0.32. That would require the planet radius to be about 32% of the star's radius.

If the star is 1 solar radius, then planet radius is 0.32 solar radii. Since 1 solar radius is ~7e5 km, the planet would be ~224,000 km in radius. Jupiter is about 70,000 km, so 3.2 times bigger. But such large planets don't exist, but as a hypothetical case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formulation.

Wait, another approach is to model the star with spots as having a lower average flux when the spotted hemisphere is in view, and when it's not, you get higher flux. The problem states that the same amplitude in the light curve as if there's an exoplanet transiting.

Therefore, the maximum to minimum variation in flux (peak to peak) is 10.3%, so the amplitude would be that.

But exoplanet transit has a much smaller depth. Wait, but maybe in this problem, the amplitude they refer to is indeed the same peak to peak, but how does the rotation modulation relate to a transit?

Wait, for rotational modulation, you have a sinusoidal-like variation in brightness with a period equal to the rotation period. It would go from maximum brightness to minimum brightness and back. The peak-to-peak amplitude would be around 10% in this case.

But for a transit, the dip is not periodic (it's only during transit) but the depth is a single dip of (Rp/R*)^2. But perhaps the problem is stating that if you have such a spotted star, the periodic brightness variations have an amplitude (peak to peak) similar to the depth of a transit of an exoplanet with radius R_p. So they want R_p/R* such that (R_p/R*)^2 is equal to the peak-to-peak amplitude from spots. Wait, but the wording is a bit unclear: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star".

So, they want that the exoplanet produces a transit depth (delta flux) which is equal to the amplitude of the variation caused by spots. However, the amplitude refers to the peak-to-peak variation (10.3%). But transit depth is a one-time dip. Hmm, but possibly they are asking to equate the delta F / F between the two cases.

That is, if the light curve modulation due to spots has a peak-to-peak amplitude of (F_max - F_min)/F_avg = 10.3%, then in the planet case, the transit depth is (R_p/R_*)^2 = delta F / F. But does "amplitude" here mean the same as transit depth? So if the maximum flux is F_max and minimum is F_min, the amplitude can refer to either (F_max - F_min)/F_avg or typically in astronomy, sometimes the semi-amplitude is used. But in transits, it's delta F / F_max.

But perhaps the key here is that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what transit depth would mimic the semi-amplitude (peak to peak over average).

Alternatively, the problem is expecting me to calculate the variation in brightness due to the spots and set that equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, the total variation is 10.3% as I calculated earlier, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.103, leading to Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.321. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants it in terms of fractional change. Let's confirm the calculations.

Given T_eff = 6000K, spot temp = 5000K. Since flux is proportional to T^4, the spot flux per unit area is (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823 of the photospheric flux.

The spotted hemisphere has 20% of its area covered with spots, so the effective flux from that hemisphere is 80% * 1 + 20% * 0.4823 ≈ 0.8 + 0.09646 ≈ 0.89646 compared to a completely unspotted hemisphere.

Therefore, when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is 0.89646 * F_hemisphere, and when the unspotted is in view, it's 1 * F_hemisphere. Thus, the total flux varies between 0.89646 and 1, with the quiescent flux (if there were no spots) being 1.

Wait, but no, the star's total flux when not spotted would be 2 hemispheres, each with flux F_hem = 0.5 * sigma*T_eff^4 * 4pi R^2/(4pi d^2) ). But maybe if we normalize the flux when all unspotted to 1, then when half is spotted, the flux is F = (1 - 0.5*0.2*(1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 )). Wait.

Alternatively, let me model the total flux from the star with one hemisphere 20% spotted.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer:

The effective emitting area is: (1 - 0.2)*hemisphere_area + 0.2*hemisphere_area*(T_spot / T_eff)^4

Translate to flux. Suppose each hemisphere has an area A = 2pi R².

But no, integrating over the visible hemisphere, maybe it's not exactly 1/2 the star's surface. Wait, but the star emits in all directions, but when it rotates, different hemispheres come into view. The flux detected is from the visible hemisphere. So modeling the flux as from the visible hemisphere.

But the actual flux we receive from the star depends on the entire surface's emission. Wait, no. For a star, the observed flux depends on the integral of the specific intensity over the visible disk. However, when a star is unresolved, we can approximate the flux as surface area times intensity (sigma*T^4). However, if the star has temperature variations over its surface, you have to integrate T^4 over the visible hemisphere.

But this is getting complicated. Let me recall that in practice, for star spots, the effect on the total flux can be approximated as the sum over the spotted areas multiplied by their contrast, as I did earlier.

But given that only one hemisphere is spotted, and the other is clean, when we see the spotted hemisphere, the flux is less, and when we see the clean hemisphere, the flux is normal.

Therefore, consider that in one hemisphere, 20% of the area is covered by spots, so spotted area on the hemisphere is 0.2*(2pi R²). The flux coming from that hemisphere would then be (0.8*(sigma*T_eff^4) + 0.2*(sigma*T_spot^4)) * 2pi R² * cos(theta)/d² integrated over the visible hemisphere. Wait, no, when the hemisphere is facing towards us, you don't have to worry about the angle, it's all in the line of sight.

Wait, actually, if we see the entire hemisphere, the flux is sigma*T^4 times the projected area. Wait, maybe the exact calculation isn't necessary here because the problem is simplifying it by considering it as a filling factor.

But given the problem states that only one hemisphere is spotty, the amplitude of variation is then the difference in flux between the spotted and unspotted hemisphere.

If the unspotted hemisphere gives total flux F0 = 0.5*F_total (assuming the star's total flux F_total = sigma*T_eff^4*4pi R²/(4pi d²)) when spots are neglected. Wait, but actually, F_total= sigma T^4 R²/d².

Indeed, flux is calculated as F = L/(4pi d²), and L = 4pi R² sigma T^4. Thus, F = (4pi R² sigma T^4 ) / (4pi d² ) = R² sigma T^4 / d². So if we have half the star emitting with T_eff and half with spots, which have 20% coverage of T_spot and 80% of T_eff. Wait, no: no, in reality, all of the star is emitting, with parts having lower temperature, but since the entire star is present, not that each hemisphere is purely one temperature. However, the rotational modulation arises from the fact that as the star spins, we see varying amounts of the spotted region. If the spots are confined to one hemisphere, when that hemisphere faces us, it blocks part of the light. Therefore, when we look at the star over its rotation period, the flux changes depending on whether the spotted side is facing us or not.

But given that, then perhaps the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spot = (0.8 * F_hem) + (0.2 * F_spot_hem), with F_hem being the flux from the hemisphere. If the entire hemisphere were unspotted, it would emit F_hem = 0.5 F_total, since the total flux from the star is F_total. With 20% spots, the flux becomes F_spot = 0.8 * 0.5 F_total + 0.2 * 0.5 F_total * (T_spot / T_eff)^4.

Thus, F_spot = 0.5 F_total [0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ] as before. Then when the other hemisphere is visible, it contributes 0.5 F_total. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is in view, contributing 0.5 F_total. The minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is in view, contributing 0.5 F_total [0.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4 ].

Wait, that seems different from previous calculations. Wait, so F_total is (as above) the star's total flux, which would be F_total = F_hem_spotted + F_hem_unspotted. Wait, but F_total is fixed.

Wait, actually, if the star has a total luminosity L = 4pi R² sigma T_eff^4. But if part of the surface is cooler, then the actual luminosity is less. However, if the star has spots on one hemisphere covering 20% with T_spot =5000K and the rest of the star is at 6000K, then the total luminosity is L = [0.8*(2pi R²) * sigma T_eff^4 + 0.2*(2pi R²) sigma T_spot^4 + 2pi R² sigma T_eff^4 ]= 2pi R² sigma [0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4 + T_eff^4] = 2pi R² sigma [1.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4 ].

But wait, if we instead ignore any temperature variation (if the spots aren't present), the luminosity would be 4pi R² sigma T_eff^4. Therefore, the spotted star has lower luminosity overall. However, the problem refers to the case where "if the star was not covered by spots!"; thus, in that case, they want to compute an exoplanet transit depth that would produce the same amplitude.

But perhaps when the problem mentions the light curve amplitude due to rotational modulation, it's compared to the maximum possible flux (unspotted hemisphere) versus the spotted. But the exoplanet transit would have a depth relative to the unspotted star's flux.

Therefore, perhaps in the exoplanet case, the depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, calculated relative to the star's total flux, which is equivalent to the unspotted star's flux.

Therefore, delta_F = F_max - F_min.

When the uncovered star's flux is F0, and when the spotted hemisphere is visible, it's F_spot = F0 * [ (0.8 + 0.2*(T_spot/Teff)^4 ) *0.5 +0.5]

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here because of the T_eff definition.

Let's back up. The star is said to have an effective temperature of 6000K. However, the presence of cool spots lowers the total luminosity. So the Teff given here already considers the spots? Or is Teff the unspotted temperature? Oh, this is a big point.

If the effective temperature (Teff) of the star is 6000K, then that is the temperature derived from the total luminosity and radius: L = 4pi R² sigma Teff^4. So even with spots, because the spot coverage reduces the luminosity, if they quote Teff = 6000K, that would imply that either the unspotted temperature is higher than 6000K, or the spot coverage is minimal so that Teff is still 6000K. Wait, but here, the star is given to have Teff=6000K, but the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. Hmmm, so the star's measured effective temperature (which is an average) is 6000K, but some parts of the surface is cooler by 1000K. So better to think that Teff here is the effective temperature derived from the total luminosity and radius, so Teff^4 = (average T^4 over the surface). So integrating over the entire surface: spots are a part of that average.

Thus, the star's overall luminosity L = 4pi R² sigma <T^4> where <T^4> is the average. When the rotations bring hemispheres into view, we’ll see deviations from the average based on the temperature distribution.

But but the problem states: 'if the star was not covered by spots!', so in that case, the star's effective temperature would be 6000K, and it's entirely unspotted. So if there were spots, but Teff stays 6000K, integrating over the entire surface. The phrase may mean that when calculating the contrast with the exoplanet transit depth, we ignore the spots and analyze as if the decrease in flux is only due to a partial eclipse by a planet.

But if the Teff is maintained, then with spots, you need the unspotted regions to compensate.

Wait, the original problem states: the star has effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K. So the actual temperature of the unspotted photosphere should be higher than 6000K in order for <T^4> =6000^4. Given that the spots are cooler. That complicates the problem, but wait, in reality, you can not derive the spot properties from the effective temperature if the star is a G star with spots. But since the problem states Teff =6000K, spots have a temperature difference of 1000K, we have to take the given Teff as the mean value. But perhaps keep in mind that the unspotted regions have a higher T.

Alternatively, the star's photosphere is 6000K, and the spots are 5000K, the Teff here refers to the unspotted regions. So the spots are just dark regions, but the star's effective temperature is defined as the temperature of the unspotted regions. Then, the star's total flux is equivalent to a blackbody with T=6000K, but with spots that are cooler. However, in reality, this is not accurate because the effective temperature should account for all surface features. This is getting confusing.

Perhaps the problem is abstracted such that the 6000K is the temperature of the unspotted photosphere, and the spots are 5000K. The star has the same radius as the sun. The mean Teff here is perhaps stipulated as 6000K regardless of spots, even if spots are present. Therefore, when you have spots in one hemisphere which has a filling factor of 20%, the overall effect is that when that hemisphere is in view, flux is lower. So this is treated as background, and the Teff is just the assumed temperature. So we can proceed with the previous calculation. The key point is that when spotted hemisphere is in view, we see lower flux. But perhaps regardless of the actual Teff. So the effective observed flux drops as a function of rotational phase.

In this case, perhaps we were given Teff =6000K as the temperature of the unspotted region. Because otherwise, if Teff includes the spots, the calculation would have been more complex.

Therefore, assuming the star without spots is at Teff=6000K. The actual star has on one hemisphere 20% spots at T=5000K, so when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is (0.8*6000K +0.2*5000K) in some sense. But flux is additive over the areas, not the temperatures. So each square meter of the star emits sigma*T^4. So the area of the spotted hemisphere is 0.5*4pi R^2. But 20% of that hemisphere is covered in spots. So normal area (on spotted hemisphere): A_n=0.8*0.5*4pi R^2=0.4*4pi R^2? Wait, no.

Total area: 4pi R². Spots are on one hemisphere covering 20% of it. A single hemisphere area is 2pi R². So spotted area is 0.2*2pi R²=0.4pi R². The rest of the hemisphere is 0.8*2pi R²=1.6pi R². The other hemisphere is totally unspotted: 2pi R².

Wait, hence total unspotted area is 1.6pi R² (spotted hemisphere's unspotted) + 2pi R² (other hemisphere) = 3.6pi R². Total spotted area =0.4pi R².

If the unspotted regions emit T_eff=6000K, and spots at 5000K.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible: the flux is (1.6pi R² * sigma*T_eff^4 +0.4pi R²*sigma*T_spot^4)/ (4pi d²). Because us viewing the spotted hemisphere can see all of its area (but only see half of the star at a time).

Wait, actually, that's not the case. Regardless of the spot distribution, when observing a star, you see the full surface of the star (approximated as a flat disk for distant stars). So our geometry might be wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is: when the star is rotating and part of it is spotty, the amount of flux you receive depends on the projected area of the spots. But rotational modulation due to spots happens as they come into and out of view as the star rotates.

But in this problem, it's stated that the amplitude arises because only one hemisphere has spots, which due to rotation periodically turns into and out of the line of sight. Therefore, if a large part of a hemisphere is spotted, then when that hemisphere faces us, we see significant flux deficit, and when it turns away, flux goes back up. The amplitude would be determined by the mean deficit when spots are present versus not.

 Assuming the star is at distance d, the flux from the star when other hemisphere is unspotted: F = (unspotted flux) + (spotted flux). Wait, no, F is the sum over entire visible hemisphere. Wait, when you look at the star, you see the hemisphere pointing towards you. If the other hemisphere is entirely unspotted, but when spots rotate into the visible hemisphere, or out. But in this case, the star has spots only on one hemisphere. After a 180-degree rotation, that hemisphere is now facing away.

Actually, the rotational modulation occurs because the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is sometimes facing towards us and sometimes away. So in that case, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux observed is lower, and when it's facing away, it's normal. However, confusion: if the spots cover part of the hemisphere (20%), then even when the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux should be normal, but when the spotted hemisphere faces us, the flux is reduced.

Wait, but the star keeps rotating, so you see different aspects. Wait, but the one hemisphere always has spots. So after half a rotation period, the other side is visible, which perhaps isn't spotted. Wait, no, hemisphere with spots fixed on the star’s surface. So as the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere rotates into and out of view. So when observer sees that hemisphere (spotted) emitting light, then reduced flux; when they see the opposite hemisphere (unspotted)), normal flux.

Therefore, over the rotation period, the light curve varies between maximum (unspotted hemisphere viewed) and minimum (spotted hemisphere viewed). So the key is just the difference between those two.

Thus, F_max (unspotted) = (sigma*T_eff^4)* (area of hemisphere / 4pi d²). Wait, F is integrating over the visible hemisphere.

But actually, the entire star is emitting, but we receive flux only from the hemisphere facing us, that light is integrated to give F. Wait, in reality, the star emits in all directions. The flux received by the observer depends only on the intensity from those points on the stellar surface visible to the observer. However, for a spherically symmetric star, if all points emit with intensity I, the flux received is just I * pi (related to the angular integral).

But for a star with spots, it's different. Let’s proceed with a more precise model.

When a star has part of its surface (on a hemisphere) spotted, then, when that hemisphere is in view, the total flux is (assumed spot covering fraction over hemisphere: 20%. So fraction oƒ the visible hemisphere with intensity I = sigma*T_spot^4 and 80% with I = sigma*T_eff^4).

But flux is the integral over the intensity multiplied by the cosine of the angle from the normal (Lambert's law). But for simplicity, rotational modulation is often simplified as the equivalent of a varying emitting area. Hence, on the spotted hemisphere:

Total flux F_spotted = [0.8 * sigma*Teff^4 + 0.2 * sigma*T_spot^4 ] * (Area of hemisphere )

But since we are at a large distance, the flux is F_spot = ( 0.8 sigma Teff^4 * pi R² + 0.2 sigma T_spot^4 * pi R² ) / d², assuming each point emits intensity according to their temperature, and the disk-integrated flux is approximated as (Be careful: The exact flux from a sphere with atemperature map involves integrals over angles, but in this problem, we might approximate comparing the average instead. Some assumptions have to be made here.)

Alternatively, areas on the star radiate according to their own temperatures, with isotropy, then the flux from each area A is F = A * sigma*T^4 / (4pi d²). So integrating over the entire star's surface. But when no spots are present, flux F0 = (4pi R² sigma Teff^4)/(4pi d²) = R² sigma Teff^4 / d².

When spots are present, flux is:

F_spotted_hem = [ (3.6pi R² * Teff^4) + (0.4pi R²)*(5000)^4 ] * sigma / (4pi d²) = [3.6 Teff^4 + 0.4 * (5/6)^4 Teff^4 ] * sigma R² / (4 d² )

Giventhat Teff=6000K.

But if we are computing F_max and F_min, then when spotted hemisphere is in view, we have F_spotted_hem = [0.8*(pi R²)*Teff^4 + 0.2*(pi R²)*(5000)^4 ] / (pi d²) ). Wait, simplifying.

Actually, the observed flux when we look at a hemisphere is sum over all surface elements, but angular dependent. For simplicity, assuming all points emit as per their temperature uniformly. In limb darkening the intensity changes, but since it's not mentioned, assuming uniform brightness. Consequently, the flux from a hemisphere is sigma T^4 * 0.5 * 4pi R² (hemi area) / 4pi d² = 0.5 R² sigma T^4 / d². When spotted hemisphere if 20% spots and 80% normal, then F_spotted_hem = [0.8 * 0.5 R² sigma Teff^4 + 0.2 * 0.5 R² sigma Tspot^4 ] / d² = 0.5 R² sigma (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 Tspot^4)/d².

Flux when unspotted hemisphere is viewed is 0.5 R² sigma Teff^4 / d². So amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [0.5 R² sigma Teff^4/d² - 0.5 R² sigma (0.8*Teff^4 +0.2*Tspot^4)/d² ] / (0.5 R² sigma Teff^4 /d² ) = [ Teff^4 - 0.8*Teff^4 -0.2*Tspot^4 ] / Teff^4 = [0.2*Teff^4* (1 - (Tspot/Teff)^4) ] / Teff^4 = 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4). So same as before.

Calculate this: 1 - (5/6)^4 ≈ 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.5177, multiply by 0.2:  0.5177 *0.2≈ 0.1035.

So (F_max - F_min)/F_max ≈0.1035. So to mimic this depth with an exoplanet transit which has depth (Rp/R*)^2.Thus, setting (Rp/R*)^2=0.1036 -> Rp/R*=sqrt(0.1035)=~0.32.

So the answer would beapproximately 0.32 or 10/31 (a round number), or maybe it should be ~0.31.

But my calculation gives approximately 0.32。But since calculation is numerical, using (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 = about 0.482253, leading to 0.2*(1 -625/1296)=0.2*(671/1296)=134.2/1296≈0.10355. So square root is around 0.3218, approx 0.32.

So the  Rpl/Rstar=0.32. Given that possible, but in standard precision, maybe 0.32.

Alternatively, Let's use exact fractions.

T_eff =6000 K

T_spot=5000K, T_spot /T_eff=5/6

(5/6)^4=625/1296

Delta_F/F_max = 0.2*(1 -625/1296)=0.2*(671/1296)=（134.2)/1296 ≈0.103549.

R_planet/R_star= Sqrt(0.103549)= approximately 0.32179, so approx 0.322.

But since they might expect an exact answer:

compute (5/6)^4=625/1296, so 1 -625/1296=671/1296.

Multiply by 0.2 (which is 1/5):

(671/1296)*(1/5)=671/6480≈0.103549.

 sqrt(671/6480) ≈ sqrt(0.103549)≈0.3218.

Thus, essentially, R_p/R_★≈0.32.

But the problem mentions that the star has a radius equal to that of the Sun; but it cancels since it's a ratio. Hence the answer should be R_planet/R_star≈0.32.


**Final Answer**
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star should be \boxed{0.32}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the scenario is that astronomers are observing a star like the Sun, but one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of it. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, as the star rotates, we'll see periodic brightness changes. The question is asking: if we were to explain this same brightness variation using an exoplanet transit instead of spots, what size would the planet need to be relative to the star?

Hmm, so essentially, they want to equate the light loss from the spots to the light loss from a transiting exoplanet. So, we need to calculate the fraction of light blocked by the spots and then find what size planet would block the same fraction.

First, let's think about the spots. The star has one hemisphere with spots covering 20% of its area. Wait, so if the radius is the same as the Sun, that's just for reference. The key here is that one hemisphere (half the surface area) is 20% covered in spots. Wait, or is the filling factor of 20% on the entire star? Wait, the problem says "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so on the one hemisphere, 20% of that hemisphere's area is covered by spots. So the total spotted area is 20% of half the star's surface. Therefore, total spotted area is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4πR²) = 0.1 * 4πR²? No, wait, surface area of a hemisphere is 2πR² (since the total surface area is 4πR², each hemisphere is 2πR²). So 20% of 2πR² is 0.4πR². Wait no, 20% of the hemisphere’s area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So total spotted area is 0.4πR². But the entire surface area is 4πR², so this spot is covering 10% of the whole star. Wait, 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered with spots. But hang on, the filling factor is a measure of the fraction of the stellar surface covered by spots. Maybe here it's just saying that on one hemisphere, the filling factor is 20%, meaning 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So total filling factor over the entire star is 10%? Maybe. So filling factor is the fraction of the visible surface covered by spots. But for the rotational modulation, it's about the projected area as the star rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots block some light, and when it's facing away, we see the full brightness. So the variation in brightness comes from the difference between the spotted hemisphere being in view versus the unspotted hemisphere. Wait, but if the spots are only on one hemisphere, is it always there, but as the star rotates, the spots rotate in and out of view? No, if the spots are only on one hemisphere, and the rotation is such that we see that hemisphere and then the other. But in this case, the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered with spots, implying that half the star is spotty, but not in the sense that all spots are on one side; but rather, in one hemisphere, some portion (20%) is covered with spots, and the other hemisphere is clear.

Wait, maybe actually understanding the geometry here is key. Let me parse the problem again. "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So a hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. A filling factor of 20% on that hemisphere means that 20% of that hemisphere's area is covered by spots. Therefore, total spot coverage is 20% of 0.5, which is 10% of the entire stellar surface. Wait, so 20% of the hemisphere's area, so 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, so 10%?

So spots cover 10% of the star's surface. But how does that affect the brightness?

But first, the star's luminosity is determined by its effective temperature. But the spots are cooler, so they emit less light. The flux from a star is proportional to its surface area times the flux per unit area, which is sigma*T^4. So the total flux from the star would be (unspotted area * T_eff^4 + spotted area * T_spot^4) * sigma. However, since the star is rotating and only the hemisphere with spots is contributing less flux when that hemisphere is facing us. Wait, no. Wait, in this setup, the star's spots are distributed on one hemisphere. But unless the star is rotating, it's just that when the spotted hemisphere is in view, we see the dark spots, and when it's not, we don't. Wait, but in reality, stars are rotating, so over time, as the star spins, different parts come into view. So the light curve would have maximum brightness when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. Therefore, the amplitude of variation would be the difference in flux between the two hemispheres divided by the average flux.

But the problem says "photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation." Meaning, when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, they block some light, so the flux drops. The key point is that the spots only cover part of the star's surface, so when that part is facing us, the total flux is lower. Therefore, the amplitude of the variation is determined by the difference in flux between the spotted hemisphere being visible versus not.

Alternatively, maybe the effective temperature is the average temperature of the star, as measured by its total luminosity. So the presence of spots reduces the overall luminosity, but since they are only on one hemisphere, the observed flux would vary as the star rotates because sometimes we see more spots, sometimes fewer.

Wait, actually, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we observe less flux from the star, and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, we see more flux. So the flux would oscillate between these two extremes. To compute the amplitude, we need to calculate the maximum flux (unspotted half) and minimum flux (spotted half). Then the amplitude would be (F_max - F_min)/(F_max + F_min) ?

Wait, actually, for a periodic variation, the amplitude is typically referred to as the relative change in brightness. For transiting exoplanets, the depth of the transit is (Rp/Rs)^2, where Rp is planet radius and Rs is star radius. So similar here, the brightness variation would be due to the contrast between the spotted and unspotted regions. So, when the spotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is lower; when it rotates out, the flux increases.

Therefore, first, we need to calculate the luminosity from the unspotted hemisphere: which is the area of the unspotted hemisphere times the flux per unit area (sigma*T_eff^4). Then, the spotted hemisphere has 20% coverage with T_spot = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K, and the remaining 80% of the hemisphere is at Teff =6000K. Then, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux would be (0.8 * sigma*T_eff^4 + 0.2 * sigma*T_spot^4) multiplied by the area of half the star? Wait, hemisphere is half the surface area. So total flux when unspotted hemisphere is facing us is (0.5*4πR²)*sigma*T_eff^4 / (4πd²) where d is the distance. But maybe we can work with relative fluxes.

Alternatively, let's just consider the flux from each hemisphere. The total flux from the star when the unspotted hemisphere is visible is (0.5 * 4πR²) * sigma*T_eff^4 / (4πd²) = (0.5 * R² * sigma*T_eff^4 ) / d². Similarly, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is (0.8 * 0.5 *4πR² * sigma*T_eff^4 + 0.2 *0.5*4πR²*sigma*(5000)^4)/4πd². So simplifying, when unspotted: F_unspotted = 0.5 * (R^2 / d^2) * sigma*T_eff^4.

When spotted: F_spotted = 0.5*(R^2 / d^2)*sigma*(0.8*T_eff^4 + 0.2*T_spot^4)

So the difference in flux is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 0.5*(R^2 / d^2)*sigma* [ T_eff^4 - (0.8*T_eff^4 + 0.2*T_spot^4) ] = 0.5*(R^2 / d^2)*sigma* [ 0.2*(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) ]

The amplitude of the variation would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_average. Wait, maybe not, we need to think about how astronomers observe the light curve.

In transit photometry, the depth is delta F / F = (Rp / R*)^2. Here, in this case, the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is in view, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is in view. So the relative drop in flux would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted. Because when the planet transits, the flux drops by (Rp/R*)^2. So maybe similar here.

Alternatively, the amplitude could be Delta F / F_avg. Let me check.

The contrast between max and min would be (F_max -

Let's examine this problem systematically. We're looking at a scenario where astronomers observe a Sun-like star with dark spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. The star has an effective temperature of 6000K, with spots that are 1000K cooler. As the star rotates, we observe periodic brightness variations. We need to determine what size an exoplanet would need to be, relative to the star, to explain these same brightness variations if they were caused by planetary transit instead of spots.

We need to equate the light reduction from the spots to the light reduction from a transiting exoplanet. First, let's clarify the spot coverage. If one hemisphere has spots with a filling factor of 20%, this means 20% of that hemisphere is covered with spots. Since a hemisphere represents 50% of the star's total surface area, the spots cover 10% of the entire stellar surface (0.2 × 0.5 = 0.1 or 10%).

When analyzing the brightness variations, we need to consider that the star's rotation brings the spotted hemisphere in and out of view. The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere faces us, and minimum brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

For the unspotted hemisphere, the flux would be: F_unspotted = 0.5 × (R²/d²) × σ × T_eff⁴

For the spotted hemisphere, 80% is at the effective temperature and 20% is at the spot temperature (5000K): F_spotted = 0.5 × (R²/d²) × σ × (0.8 × T_eff⁴ + 0.2 × T_spot⁴)

The difference in flux is: F_unspotted - F_spotted = 0.5 × (R²/d²) × σ × [T_eff⁴ - (0.8 × T_eff⁴ + 0.2 × T_spot⁴)] = 0.5 × (R²/d²) × σ × [0.2 × (T_eff⁴ - T_spot⁴)]

In transit photometry, the depth of a transit is expressed as ΔF/F = (Rp/R*)², where Rp is the planet radius and R* is the star radius. Similarly, for our spotted star, the relative flux drop would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted, which should equal (Rp/R*)² if an exoplanet were to cause the same brightness variation.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's address this issue. We have a situation where astronomers are studying a Sun-like star with dark spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Since these spots are on a single hemisphere, rotating the star results in periodic brightness changes. The problem asks: if this same brightness variation were caused by an exoplanet transit instead of spots, what size would the planet need to be compared to the star?

Basically, we need to equate the light blocked by the spots to that from a transiting exoplanet. Our goal is to calculate how much light is obstructed by the spots and then determine the size of a planet that would cause the same obstruction.

Let's consider the spots: one hemisphere of the star has spots covering 20% of its area. The star's radius, comparable to the Sun, is just for comparison. The main point is that one hemisphere, half the surface area, has 20% covered in spots. Or is it 20% of the whole star? According to the problem, "One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%," which means 20% of that hemisphere's area is spotted. The total spotted area is 0.2 of the half surface. Surface area of a hemisphere is 2πR² (total surface area is 4πR², each hemisphere is 2πR²). With spots covering 20% of 2πR², the spotted area becomes 0.4πR², not quite precisely 0.4πR²—let’s get this right: 20% of 2πR² is indeed 0.4πR². Therefore, the total star surface covered by spots is 0.1 of its entire surface. Factoring in the entire surface area of 4πR² shows that spots occupy 10% of it. Maybe the filling factor helps define the fraction of the star's surface covered in spots. In this rotational modulation case, it's about the projected area as the star rotates. When spotted hemisphere faces us, some light is blocked, and when it faces away, the brightness is full. Brightness variation results from the difference when the spotted hemisphere is in sight as opposed to an unspotted one.

Understanding this geometry is pivotal. The problem reads, "One hemisphere... covered 20% with spots." If a hemisphere equals half the surface, then a 20% filling factor on half implies 20% of that hemisphere's area is covered. Total coverage is 20% of 0.5, or 10% of the star's total area covered.

So, spots hide 10% of the star's surface. How does this change brightness?

Luminosity centres around effective temperature; cooler spots mean lower emissions. Star flux matches its surface area times flux per surface area, which is sigma*T^4. Total star flux thus involves (unspotted area * T_eff^4 + spotted area * T_spot^4) * sigma. Spots contribute less flux when the hemisphere they occupy faces us. However, as the star rotates, the light curve peaks with the unspotted hemisphere visible and dips when the spotted region shows. Hence, the brightness modulation comes from the flux differential between the two hemispheres compared to average flux.

In an exoplanet transit, the flux drop depth is (Rp/Rs)^2, (Rp being planet radius, Rs star radius). Similar logic applies here, with brightness variation stemming from the contrasts between spotted and unspotted areas. With the spotted hemisphere in view, flux drops; when it rotates out, flux rises.

To compute, the unspotted hemisphere's luminosity is its area times flux per unit area (sigma*T_eff^4). The spotted hemisphere is 20% covered, with T_spot = 6000K - 1000K = 5000K, and the balance of 80% at 6000K. With the spotted hemisphere facing, total flux would equal (0.8 * sigma*T_eff^4 + 0.2 * sigma*T_spot^4) by half the star's area. When unspotted hemisphere shows, the flux is (0.5*4πR²)*sigma*T_eff^4 / (4πd²), where d is distance, working with relative fluxes.

Considering each hemisphere individually, flux from the unspotted one equals (0.5 * 4πR²) * sigma*T_eff^4 / (4πd²) = (0.5 * R² * sigma*T_eff^4 ) / d². When spotted, it's (0.8 * 0.5 *4πR² * sigma*T_eff^4 + 0.2 *0.5*4πR²*sigma*(5000)^4)/4πd². Simplifying: F_unspotted = 0.5 * (R^2 / d^2) * sigma*T_eff^4; F_spotted = 0.5*(R^2 / d^2)*sigma*(0.8*T_eff^4 + 0.2*T_spot^4).

The flux difference is F_unspotted - F_spotted = 0.5*(R^2 / d^2)*sigma*[T_eff^4 - (0.8*T_eff^4 + 0.2*T_spot^4)] = 0.5*(R^2 / d^2)*sigma*[0.2*(T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)].

The amplitude of variation would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_average, calculating how astronomers observe the light curve. In transit, depth is delta F / F = (Rp / R*)^2. Here, the maximum is when the unspotted hemisphere faces, the minimum when spots do. Thus, relative flux reduction mirrors transit occurrences: (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted aligns with planetary transit depth.

Alternatively, amplitude might be Delta F / F_avg, warranting reassessment.

However, if they just say "amplitude", sometimes it can be the peak-to-peak amplitude, which is (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, or it could be expressed as a fraction of F_max. So maybe the problem expects us to compute the peak-to-peak variation relative to the mean flux, or relative to the maximum. But in transits, the depth is (Rp/Rs)^2 relative to the unobscured flux. So if equivalently the exoplanet transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2, then if the star had spots but gives a signal equal in amplitude, then this dip should equal the flux difference caused by the spots. Wait, actually no. In the transit case, when the planet is in front of the star, you lose (Rp/Rstar)^2 fraction of light. But in the spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than when it\'s not. So the dip is like a transit, but cyclic because the spot comes into view periodically. However, the shape of the light curve is different. But maybe, regardless of the shape, they just equate the maximum depth (the fractional decrease when spotted hemisphere is facing us) to the transit depth. So spot-induced variation depth is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [ (0.5*T_eff^4 + 0.5*(0.8*T_eff^4 + 0.2*T_spot^4) ) ... Wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, maybe leading myself into confusion. Let\'s try step by step.\n\nFirst compute the flux when the spots are not visible (unspotted hemisphere in view):\n\nF_unspotted = 0.5 * F_total (since half the star\'s surface is emitting at Teff =6000K, and the other half is emitting at lower temp, but when we look at the unspotted hemisphere, only the 0.5 surface area at Teff. But wait, the problem states that \'the star has an effective temperature of 6000K\'. Normally, the effective temperature is the total luminosity divided by the surface area. So the presence of spots would lower the total luminosity. Wait, maybe that\'s an extra complication. Wait, or is Teff given as 6000K the temperature of the unspotted regions, and the spots are 1000K cooler (5000K). Then the total luminosity is (unspotted area * T_eff^4 + spotted area * T_spot^4) * sigma. But does Teff in the problem refer to the effective temperature of the entire star (which would be the luminosity-equivalent temperature including spots) or the temperature of the unspotted regions? Hmm. Wait, the problem says "the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K". Effective temperature is normally defined as the temperature of a black body with the same total luminosity and radius. So if the star has spots, the effective temperature is calculated by measuring the total luminosity, so that accounts for the spots. Wait, but then how can the problem state the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K? That must mean Teff_photosphere =6000K, and T_spot =5000K. So then, when calculating the emission from the star\'s surface, the unspotted parts are at 6000K, spots at 5000K. But we have to be careful here.\n\nHowever, the problem states the star has Teff of 6000K. Normally, Teff is such that L = 4πR² sigma Teff^4. Suppose the star\'s actual luminosity is lower because of the spots. Wait, but if the problem gives Teff as 6000K, maybe that\'s intended to be the photospheric temperature, so the unspotted regions are 6000K, and spotted regions are 5000K. Then, the star\'s actual effective temperature (in terms of L_total = 4πR² sigma Teff_true^4) would be lower. However, this might complicate things, but the problem says "the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K", so we need to interpret that in some way.\n\nWait, perhaps in the problem statement, when it says the star has an effective temperature of 6000K, that already accounts for the spots. But then, if we have regions that are cooler, the overall Teff would be 6000K as given. Alternatively, they might be speaking about the unspotted regions being 6000K, and the spots being 5000K. This is a key ambiguity that needs clarification. Hmm. Let\'s read the problem statement again: "the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K". So temperature difference is 1000K relative to Teff. Therefore, assuming Teff is the temperature of the unspotted photosphere, which is 6000K, spots are 5000K.\n\nNow, when the hemisphere with the spots is facing us, then 20% of that hemisphere is covered with spots. So area of one hemisphere is 2πR². 20% of that is 0.4πR². The rest of the hemisphere (80% of it) is 1.6πR². So the total flux when spotted hemisphere is facing us is (1.6πR² * sigma*6000^4 + 0.4πR² * sigma*5000^4). That is compared to the unspotted hemisphere, which is 2πR² * sigma*6000^4. Therefore, F_max = 2πR² sigma*6000^4 / (4πd²) = (0.5*R² / d²)*sigma*6000^4. Similarly, F_min = (1.6πR² sigma*6000^4 + 0.4πR² sigma*5000^4) / (4πd²) = (0.4 R² sigma*6000^4 + 0.1 R² sigma*5000^4) / d². Therefore, the minimum flux is [0.4*(6000)^4 + 0.1*(5000)^4] * (sigma R² / d² ). The maximum flux is 0.5*(6000)^4*(sigma R² / d² ). So to compute the relative difference, which is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.\n\nWait, if we think of the transit case, when the planet is transiting, the depth is (Rp/R*)^2, which is the fraction of the area blocked. So in transit, the depth is (Rp/R*)^2, assuming the planet is completely dark. However, in the spots case, not only is the area blocked, but it\'s also at a different temperature. So maybe stars with spots blocking light with a different temperature, but planet is dark. So this is a complication.\n\nBut according to the problem: "if the star was not covered by spots!, what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star?"\n\nSo in that case, they want us to compute the exoplanet radius such that when it transits, the depth of the transit (which is (Rp/R*)^2) is equal to the maximum relative flux variation caused by the spots. But the flux variation in the spot case is as above.\n\nSo first, compute (F_max - F_min)/F_max. Then, set that equal to (Rp/R*)^2 and solve for Rp/R*.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem refers to peak to peak amplitude, but no, transits have a dip, while the spot modulation is also a dip periodically. However, for exoplanet transits, the variation is from 1.0 to (1 - (Rp/Rs)^2), so the depth is (Rp/Rs)^2. For the starspot, the variation is between F_max and F_min, so amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max. Therefore, if we equate (F_max - F_min)/F_max = (Rp/Rs)^2, then (Rp/Rs) = sqrt[(F_max - F_min)/F_max].\n\nSo calculate (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [0.5*(6000)^4 - (0.4*(6000)^4 + 0.1*(5000)^4)] / (0.5*(6000)^4).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute numerator: 0.5*T1^4 - [0.4*T1^4 + 0.1*T2^4], where T1=6000K, T2=5000K.\n\nThe numerator becomes 0.5*T1^4 - 0.4*T1^4 -0.1*T2^4 = 0.1*T1^4 -0.1*T2^4 = 0.1*(T1^4 - T2^4).\n\nDenominator is 0.5*T1^4.\n\nTherefore, the relative flux variation is [0.1*(T1^4 - T2^4)] / [0.5*T1^4] = (0.1 /0.5)*[1 - (T2/T1)^4] = 0.2*[1 - (5000/6000)^4]\n\nCalculate (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333. (0.8333)^4 ≈ (0.8333^2)^2 = (0.6944)^2 ≈ 0.4823. Therefore, 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177. Multiply by 0.2 gives ≈ 0.1035. So the flux variation is approximately 10.35%.\n\nThus, (Rp/Rs)^2 ≈ 0.1035. Therefore, Rp/Rs ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217. So Rp/Rs ≈ 32.17%, so approximately 0.32. But let me check the calculation more exactly.\n\nCompute T1 =6000, T2=5000.\n\nT2/T1 = 5/6 ≈0.833333...\n\n(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253...\n\nThen 1 - 0.482253 ≈0.517747...\n\nMultiply by 0.1: 0.0517747\n\nDivide by 0.5 (denominator 0.5*T1^4 is 0.5, the 0.5*T1^4 cancels with the same term elsewhere?), wait scratch let me double check:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n(% flux variation) = [0.1*(T1^4 - T2^4)] / [0.5*T1^4]\n\nSo can factor out T1^4: [0.1*(1 - (T2/T1)^4)] / 0.5\n\nSo that\'s 0.1/0.5 * [1 - (T2/T1)^4] = 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)^4]\n\n(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈0.482253.\n\n1 - 0.482253 =0.517747.\n\nMultiply by 0.2: 0.103549.\n\nThen sqrt(0.103549) ≈0.3218, so approximately 0.322. Therefore, R_planet / R_star ≈0.322.\n\nExpressed as a fraction, this is approximately 0.32 or 32%. So the exoplanet would need a radius approximately 32% of the star\'s radius. Since the star is the same radius as the Sun, then planet radius would be 0.32 R_sun. However, R_sun is about 7e5 km, but perhaps in terms of Jupiter radii... But the question just asks for Rpl/Rstar, so 0.32, so the answer is approx 0.32. But need to be precise.\n\nBut let me check more precisely: 5/6^4.\n\n5/6= 0.8333333333, then (0.8333333333)^4: compute 0.8333^2 = 0.6944, then 0.6944^2= approx 0.4822.\n\nBut more accurately, 5000/6000=5/6≈0.833333. (5/6)^4=625/1296. 625 divided by 1296 is equal to 0.4822530864197531.\n\nThen 1 - 0.4822530864197531 = 0.5177469135802469. Multiply by 0.2 (from 0.1 /0.5=0.2) gives 0.10354938271604938.\n\nTake sqrt(0.10354938271604938). Square root of 0.1035 is about 0.322 as sqrt(0.1024)=0.32, sqrt(0.1089)=0.33. Let\'s compute 0.3218^2=0.1035. Therefore, up to four decimal places, sqrt(0.103549)= approx 0.321787.\n\nThus, R_planet / R_star ≈0.3218, so approximately 0.322 or 32.2%.\n\nSo the answer is approximately 0.32 times the radius of the star.\n\nBut the problem says "what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?"\n\nSo the answer is approximately 0.32. Since solar radius is 1, Jupiter is about 0.1 R_sun, so 0.32 R_sun is roughly 3.2 Jupiter radii, which is a large planet, but not impossible.\n\nAlternatively, exoplanet radius is often compared to Jupiter. But since the star is Sun-like, giving the answer in terms of R_earth or other is possible, but the question states R_pl / R_star, so 0.32 is acceptable. However, perhaps we need to use more precise calculations, but maybe approximate.\n\nSo my conclusion is that the radius ratio is approximately the square root of (0.2*(1 - (5000/6000)^4)), which gives 0.32, so Rp/Rs ≈0.32.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star should be \\boxed{0.32}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743818404, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3805, prompt_tokens=2348, total_tokens=6153, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star (Rpl/Rstar) that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the observed spots, we need to compare the light loss from the spots to the light loss during a planetary transit.

1. **Calculate the flux variation due to spots:**
   - The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler (5000 K).
   - The spotted hemisphere covers 20% of the hemisphere's area, which is 10% of the total surface area of the star.
   - When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux contribution is from 80% of the hemisphere at 6000 K and 20% at 5000 K.
   - The maximum flux (F_max) is from the unspotted hemisphere, and the minimum flux (F_min) is from the spotted hemisphere.

2. **Flux calculations:**
   - F_max = 0.5 * (6000 K)^4
   - F_min = 0.4 * (6000 K)^4 + 0.1 * (5000 K)^4

3. **Relative flux variation:**
   - The relative flux variation is given by:
     \[
     \frac{F_\text{max} - F_\text{min}}{F_\text{max}} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 6000^4 - (0.4 \cdot 6000^4 + 0.1 \cdot 5000^4)}{0.5 \cdot 6000^4}
     \]
   - Simplifying this expression:
     \[
     \frac{0.1 \cdot (6000^4 - 5000^4)}{0.5 \cdot 6000^4} = 0.2 \left(1 - \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4\right)
     \]
   - Calculating the temperature term:
     \[
     \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.4823
     \]
   - Therefore, the relative flux variation is:
     \[
     0.2 \left(1 - 0.4823\right) \approx 0.1035
     \]

4. **Equating to exoplanet transit depth:**
   - The transit depth due to an exoplanet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Setting this equal to the relative flux variation:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_\text{pl}}{R_\text{star}}\right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
   - Solving for Rpl/Rstar:
     \[
     \frac{R_\text{pl}}{R_\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218
     \]

Thus, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star should be \boxed{0.32}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 F_min)/F_avg = amplitude in magnitude terms. However, if they just say "amplitude", sometimes it can be the peak-to-peak amplitude, which is (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, or it could be expressed as a fraction of F_max. So maybe the problem expects us to compute the peak-to-peak variation relative to the mean flux, or relative to the maximum. But in transits, the depth is (Rp/Rs)^2 relative to the unobscured flux. So if equivalently the exoplanet transit would cause a dip of (Rpl/Rstar)^2, then if the star had spots but gives a signal equal in amplitude, then this dip should equal the flux difference caused by the spots. Wait, actually no. In the transit case, when the planet is in front of the star, you lose (Rp/Rstar)^2 fraction of light. But in the spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than when it's not. So the dip is like a transit, but cyclic because the spot comes into view periodically. However, the shape of the light curve is different. But maybe, regardless of the shape, they just equate the maximum depth (the fractional decrease when spotted hemisphere is facing us) to the transit depth. So spot-induced variation depth is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [ (0.5*T_eff^4 + 0.5*(0.8*T_eff^4 + 0.2*T_spot^4) ) ... Wait, no.

Wait, actually, maybe leading myself into confusion. Let's try step by step.

First compute the flux when the spots are not visible (unspotted hemisphere in view):

F_unspotted = 0.5 * F_total (since half the star's surface is emitting at Teff =6000K, and the other half is emitting at lower temp, but when we look at the unspotted hemisphere, only the 0.5 surface area at Teff. But wait, the problem states that 'the star has an effective temperature of 6000K'. Normally, the effective temperature is the total luminosity divided by the surface area. So the presence of spots would lower the total luminosity. Wait, maybe that's an extra complication. Wait, or is Teff given as 6000K the temperature of the unspotted regions, and the spots are 1000K cooler (5000K). Then the total luminosity is (unspotted area * T_eff^4 + spotted area * T_spot^4) * sigma. But does Teff in the problem refer to the effective temperature of the entire star (which would be the luminosity-equivalent temperature including spots) or the temperature of the unspotted regions? Hmm. Wait, the problem says "the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K". Effective temperature is normally defined as the temperature of a black body with the same total luminosity and radius. So if the star has spots, the effective temperature is calculated by measuring the total luminosity, so that accounts for the spots. Wait, but then how can the problem state the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K? That must mean Teff_photosphere =6000K, and T_spot =5000K. So then, when calculating the emission from the star's surface, the unspotted parts are at 6000K, spots at 5000K. But we have to be careful here.

However, the problem states the star has Teff of 6000K. Normally, Teff is such that L = 4πR² sigma Teff^4. Suppose the star's actual luminosity is lower because of the spots. Wait, but if the problem gives Teff as 6000K, maybe that's intended to be the photospheric temperature, so the unspotted regions are 6000K, and spotted regions are 5000K. Then, the star's actual effective temperature (in terms of L_total = 4πR² sigma Teff_true^4) would be lower. However, this might complicate things, but the problem says "the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K", so we need to interpret that in some way.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, when it says the star has an effective temperature of 6000K, that already accounts for the spots. But then, if we have regions that are cooler, the overall Teff would be 6000K as given. Alternatively, they might be speaking about the unspotted regions being 6000K, and the spots being 5000K. This is a key ambiguity that needs clarification. Hmm. Let's read the problem statement again: "the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K". So temperature difference is 1000K relative to Teff. Therefore, assuming Teff is the temperature of the unspotted photosphere, which is 6000K, spots are 5000K.

Now, when the hemisphere with the spots is facing us, then 20% of that hemisphere is covered with spots. So area of one hemisphere is 2πR². 20% of that is 0.4πR². The rest of the hemisphere (80% of it) is 1.6πR². So the total flux when spotted hemisphere is facing us is (1.6πR² * sigma*6000^4 + 0.4πR² * sigma*5000^4). That is compared to the unspotted hemisphere, which is 2πR² * sigma*6000^4. Therefore, F_max = 2πR² sigma*6000^4 / (4πd²) = (0.5*R² / d²)*sigma*6000^4. Similarly, F_min = (1.6πR² sigma*6000^4 + 0.4πR² sigma*5000^4) / (4πd²) = (0.4 R² sigma*6000^4 + 0.1 R² sigma*5000^4) / d². Therefore, the minimum flux is [0.4*(6000)^4 + 0.1*(5000)^4] * (sigma R² / d² ). The maximum flux is 0.5*(6000)^4*(sigma R² / d² ). So to compute the relative difference, which is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Wait, if we think of the transit case, when the planet is transiting, the depth is (Rp/R*)^2, which is the fraction of the area blocked. So in transit, the depth is (Rp/R*)^2, assuming the planet is completely dark. However, in the spots case, not only is the area blocked, but it's also at a different temperature. So maybe stars with spots blocking light with a different temperature, but planet is dark. So this is a complication.

But according to the problem: "if the star was not covered by spots!, what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star?"

So in that case, they want us to compute the exoplanet radius such that when it transits, the depth of the transit (which is (Rp/R*)^2) is equal to the maximum relative flux variation caused by the spots. But the flux variation in the spot case is as above.

So first, compute (F_max - F_min)/F_max. Then, set that equal to (Rp/R*)^2 and solve for Rp/R*.

Alternatively, if the problem refers to peak to peak amplitude, but no, transits have a dip, while the spot modulation is also a dip periodically. However, for exoplanet transits, the variation is from 1.0 to (1 - (Rp/Rs)^2), so the depth is (Rp/Rs)^2. For the starspot, the variation is between F_max and F_min, so amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max. Therefore, if we equate (F_max - F_min)/F_max = (Rp/Rs)^2, then (Rp/Rs) = sqrt[(F_max - F_min)/F_max].

So calculate (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [0.5*(6000)^4 - (0.4*(6000)^4 + 0.1*(5000)^4)] / (0.5*(6000)^4).

Let me compute that:

First, compute numerator: 0.5*T1^4 - [0.4*T1^4 + 0.1*T2^4], where T1=6000K, T2=5000K.

The numerator becomes 0.5*T1^4 - 0.4*T1^4 -0.1*T2^4 = 0.1*T1^4 -0.1*T2^4 = 0.1*(T1^4 - T2^4).

Denominator is 0.5*T1^4.

Therefore, the relative flux variation is [0.1*(T1^4 - T2^4)] / [0.5*T1^4] = (0.1 /0.5)*[1 - (T2/T1)^4] = 0.2*[1 - (5000/6000)^4]

Calculate (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333. (0.8333)^4 ≈ (0.8333^2)^2 = (0.6944)^2 ≈ 0.4823. Therefore, 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177. Multiply by 0.2 gives ≈ 0.1035. So the flux variation is approximately 10.35%.

Thus, (Rp/Rs)^2 ≈ 0.1035. Therefore, Rp/Rs ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217. So Rp/Rs ≈ 32.17%, so approximately 0.32. But let me check the calculation more exactly.

Compute T1 =6000, T2=5000.

T2/T1 = 5/6 ≈0.833333...

(5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253...

Then 1 - 0.482253 ≈0.517747...

Multiply by 0.1: 0.0517747

Divide by 0.5 (denominator 0.5*T1^4 is 0.5, the 0.5*T1^4 cancels with the same term elsewhere?), wait scratch let me double check:

Original expression:

(% flux variation) = [0.1*(T1^4 - T2^4)] / [0.5*T1^4]

So can factor out T1^4: [0.1*(1 - (T2/T1)^4)] / 0.5

So that's 0.1/0.5 * [1 - (T2/T1)^4] = 0.2 * [1 - (5/6)^4]

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈0.482253.

1 - 0.482253 =0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.103549.

Then sqrt(0.103549) ≈0.3218, so approximately 0.322. Therefore, R_planet / R_star ≈0.322.

Expressed as a fraction, this is approximately 0.32 or 32%. So the exoplanet would need a radius approximately 32% of the star's radius. Since the star is the same radius as the Sun, then planet radius would be 0.32 R_sun. However, R_sun is about 7e5 km, but perhaps in terms of Jupiter radii... But the question just asks for Rpl/Rstar, so 0.32, so the answer is approx 0.32. But need to be precise.

But let me check more precisely: 5/6^4.

5/6= 0.8333333333, then (0.8333333333)^4: compute 0.8333^2 = 0.6944, then 0.6944^2= approx 0.4822.

But more accurately, 5000/6000=5/6≈0.833333. (5/6)^4=625/1296. 625 divided by 1296 is equal to 0.4822530864197531.

Then 1 - 0.4822530864197531 = 0.5177469135802469. Multiply by 0.2 (from 0.1 /0.5=0.2) gives 0.10354938271604938.

Take sqrt(0.10354938271604938). Square root of 0.1035 is about 0.322 as sqrt(0.1024)=0.32, sqrt(0.1089)=0.33. Let's compute 0.3218^2=0.1035. Therefore, up to four decimal places, sqrt(0.103549)= approx 0.321787.

Thus, R_planet / R_star ≈0.3218, so approximately 0.322 or 32.2%.

So the answer is approximately 0.32 times the radius of the star.

But the problem says "what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?"

So the answer is approximately 0.32. Since solar radius is 1, Jupiter is about 0.1 R_sun, so 0.32 R_sun is roughly 3.2 Jupiter radii, which is a large planet, but not impossible.

Alternatively, exoplanet radius is often compared to Jupiter. But since the star is Sun-like, giving the answer in terms of R_earth or other is possible, but the question states R_pl / R_star, so 0.32 is acceptable. However, perhaps we need to use more precise calculations, but maybe approximate.

So my conclusion is that the radius ratio is approximately the square root of (0.2*(1 - (5000/6000)^4)), which gives 0.32, so Rp/Rs ≈0.32.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star should be \boxed{0.32}.

The total flux from the unspotted hemisphere is straightforward. For the spotted hemisphere, since 20% of its area is cooler, the flux is reduced by a factor dependent on the temperature difference.\n\nComputing flux contributions:\n\nFlux from unspotted hemisphere: F_unspotted = 0.5 * L_total\n\nFlux from spotted hemisphere: F_spotted = 0.5 * (0.8*L_total + 0.2*L_spot)\nWhere L_spot is the luminosity of the spotted regions compared to the unspotted. Since L is proportional to T^4, L_spot = (5000/6000)^4 * L_normal_region = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482\n\nWait, but actually each spot contributes (T_spot/T_eff)^4 times flux per unit area. So the flux from the spotted hemisphere is F_spotted = 0.5 * [0.8 * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4] / T_eff^4 * L_total * 0.5 ?\n\nWait maybe another approach is better. Let me consider the star’s total luminosity as the sum of spotted and unspotted parts when the spots are present.\n\nBut when the star is rotating and we observe it over time, the flux varies because half the star (unspotted) contributes more flux, and when the spotted half is facing us, flux is less. So the change in flux between maximum and minimum is the difference between the flux from unspotted hemisphere and the flux from spotted hemisphere.\n\nTherefore, the variation (amplitude) would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_total, where F_total is usually the average flux when viewing the entire star. Wait, but when the star is spotted with 10% of its surface area covered, the average flux when the star is integrated over all rotation phases would be lower, but in this problem, are we comparing the maximum to minimum (peak to trough) variation caused by rotation? Because the question says the amplitude due to rotational modulation equals the transit amplitude.\n\nHmm. To clarify:\n\nFor spots, the amplitude is the difference between the maximum flux (spot-free hemisphere) and minimum flux (spotted hemisphere) divided by the average flux. Then, this amplitude is compared to the transit depth which is (Rp/R*)^2.\n\nBut perhaps, alternatively, the spot modulation amplitude is just the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux? For example, (F_max - F_min)/F_max = δ, and in the exoplanet transit case, the depth is (F_normal - F_transit)/F_normal = (Rp/R*)^2.\n\nTherefore, if the amplitude of the spot-induced variation is δ, then (F_max - F_min)/F_max = ΔL/L_max ≈ (Rp/R*)^2.\n\nAssuming there are spots on 10% of the star\'s surface when they\'re present on half of the star, but this leads to a larger effect when rotated into view.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to model the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible vs. when it\'s not:\n\nWhen spots are on the hemisphere facing us: F_min = 0.8 * F_hemi + 0.2 * (T_spot/T_eff)^4 * F_hemi\n\nWhen spots are on the far side, the hemisphere facing us is unspotted: F_max = F_hemi\n\nTherefore, F_max - F_min = F_hemi - [0.8 + 0.2*(T_spot/Teff)^4] * F_hemi = F_hemi * [1 - 0.8 - 0.2*(T_spot/Teff)^4)] = F_hemi * 0.2 [1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4)]\n\nThen, the relative amplitude (assuming the star’s whole flux when unspotted is 2 * F_hemi, i.e., two hemispheres each of flux F_hemi when unspotted). But when the star is not rotating with spots, but in average (without spots), the total flux is 2 F_hemi. However, when one hemisphere is spotted, the hemisphere contributes 0.8 F_hemi + 0.2 F_spot, right? So actually, the average flux over the entire surface would be reduced even when considering the entire star. However, when only looking at the rotational modulation, we observe the variation from F_max to F_min. So how does the user compare it to the transit?\n\nAh, perhaps the question simplifies it: when the star is not covered by spots (hypothetically), then the exoplanet would cause a transit by blocking a part of the stellar disk, so the depth would be (Rp/R*)^2. The spot-induced variation (while the star is spotted but the spots are distributed such that rotational modulation causes a variation), when the star is Intrinsically unspotted. Hmm... no, the problem states that "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star\'s light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)", so the hypothetical exoplanet\'s transit depth would match the amplitude that would otherwise be caused by the spottedness.\n\nTherefore, in the real scenario, when the star\'s spots are rotating into view, causing the star\'s brightness to vary between F_max (full brightness when spotted hemisphere is not observable) and F_min (spotted hemisphere is fully observable). The amplitude would be (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, perhaps, but sometimes people consider peak-to-peak amplitude as (F_max - F_min)/F_avg. On the other hand, exoplanet transit depth is a simple (Rp/R*)^2. So to have same "amplitude", when star is not spotted, we need the planet transit to cause a decrease in brightness equal to the spot-induced variation.\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe amplitude caused by spots is (F_max - F_min)/F_max, perhaps. Let\'s confirm.\n\nAssuming when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we have F_min. When it is not, F_max. The max minus min over the max would be (F_max - F_min)/F_max = Delta F/F_max. Exoplanet transit would cause Delta F/F = (Rp/R*)^2.\n\nSo perhaps we need to set these equal. Thus: (F_max - F_min)/F_max = (Rp/R*)^2.\n\nCompute F_max and F_min.\n\nF_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us: the flux is 0.5 * L_total_spotless.\n\nBut wait, the total luminosity of the actual spotted star may be slightly lower than the unspotted one, but when the spots are not facing the observer, the observed flux from that hemisphere wouldn\'t be affected— You know, the total luminosity of the actual star (with spots) isn\'t necessarily directly part of this problem because the variation is due to the rotational modulation—so when the spots are not facing us, the hemisphere is emitting as if it has no spots? Wait, that doesn\'t make sense. How is the star in reality? The spots are always present on one hemisphere—rotating star, so depending on rotation phase, we see different hemispheres. Therefore, when the spots come into view, we see the lower flux from that hemisphere. The actual total luminosity of the star (if you average over the entire surface) is lower than the unspotted star. But when the exoplanet transits, the brightness variation is measured relative to the unobscured star. However, the problem states: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star\'s light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So the \'signal\' in the exoplanet case would be (Rp/R*)^2. The spot-induced signal in the actual spotted star is a periodic modulation. For purpose of comparing "amplitude", assuming that spot-free star would mean the maximal flux is when the bright hemisphere is viewed, but in reality, stars without spots don\'t have that variation. Maybe the question is saying suppose the same star, and imagine the spots are not there, but to have someone who misinterprets the rotation modulation as an exoplanet transit would see a transit depth equivalent to that photometric amplitude. So perhaps equivalently, if you have a spot modulation (F_max - F_min) / F_max = (Rp/R*)^2.\n\nWhere F_max is the spot-free hemisphere flux and F_min is the flux from the spotted hemisphere.\n\nCalculating F_max and F_min:\n\nSuppose each hemisphere, when unspotted, has flux F0. Then, F_max is F0 (since the entire hemisphere is unspotted).\n\nF_min is the sum of 80% of F0 and 20% of (T_spot / Teff)^4 * F0:\n\nF_min = F0*(0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4).\n\nLet’s compute (5000/6000)^4. 5000/6000 = 5/6. (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482. So,\n\nF_min = F0*(0.8 + 0.2*0.482) = F0*(0.8 + 0.0964) ≈ F0*0.8964.\n\nTherefore,\n\nDelta_F = F_max - F_min = F0 - 0.8964*F0 = 0.1036*F0.\n\nThe relative amplitude is Delta_F / F_max = 0.1036 ≈ 10.36%.\n\nNow, we need the transit depth to be 0.1036, so (Rp/R*)^2 ≈ 0.1036, so Rp/R* ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.\n\nTherefore, the planet would need to have a radius ≈32.2% of the star’s radius. Since the star has the same radius as the Sun, the exoplanet radius would be calculated relative to that. Wait, but Jupiter is about 0.1 R_sun, so this would be three times Jupiter\'s radius. That\'s super large, but perhaps correct?\n\nAlternatively, double-check calculations.\n\nWait, maybe misunderstanding: when the entire hemisphere is NOT SPOTTED, but ahem. Wait, problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%". So 20% filling factor indicates that 20% (i.e., 20% area coverage) of the hemisphere is spots. So it\'s correct that 20% of half the star is covered. So 10% of the star’s total surface area.\n\nBut flux from spotted hemisphere:\n\nThe contribution of the hemisphere when spotted part is in view: the 80% emits as Teff (assuming that the "filling factor" is the areal coverage). The other 20% is spot with T_eff - 1000 = 5000K. So the flux from the spotted hemisphere:\n\nF_spotted = 0.8 * F_hemi_spotless + 0.2 * (T_spot / T_eff)^4 * F_hemi_spotless.\n\nSo yes, where F_hemi_spotless is the flux from a hemisphere with no spots, that is, a normal hemisphere. So F_hemi_spotless = 0.5 * L_total(total unspotted star) *, but when we compute the contrast (delta F)/F, then perhaps let\'s think in terms of the flux of the entire (unspotted) star would be two hemispheres each emitting F_hemi. So F_total_spotless = 2*F_hemi. When the star is spotted, the total average flux (which I might not need here) would be 2*(0.9*F_hemi + 0.1*F_hemi* (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ), assuming that 10% of total surface area is spots. But wait, in the problem, only one hemisphere is 20% spotted. Therefore, hemisphere 1: 1 (in case of unspotted), total hemisphere_flux. Hemisphere 2: is 20% spotted, so its flux is 0.8*F_hemi + 0.2*F_hemi*(5000/6000)^4. Therefore, the average total flux is F_hemi + (0.8*F_hemi + 0.2*F_hemi*0.482) = F_hemi*(1 + 0.8 + 0.0964)≈ 1.8964.\n\nBut the modulation comes from when we look at hemisphere 1 (unspotted) gives F_hemi*1, hemisphere 2 (spotted) its observed flux is 0.8*F_hemi + 0.2*F_hemi*(0.482) as before, which is 0.8964*F_hemi.\n\nSo the difference between max (hemisphere 1) and min (hemisphere 2): 1 - 0.8964 = 0.1036 per hemisphere. The total flux when in neither hemisphere is visible would actually vary depending on viewing angle, but assuming the star\'s rotation axis is inclined edge-on, so we see different hemispheres.\n\nBut in reality, maximum flux would be when hemisphere 1 is facing us (F_max = F_hemi) and minimum when hemisphere 2 is facing us (F_min = 0.8964*F_hemi). So the observed variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_avg?\n\nThe question says to compare to an exoplanet transit which has a depth of (Rp/R*)^2 against an unspotted star. Therefore, the depth to compare would be (F_max - F_min)/F_max. Because when the exoplanet transits an unspotted star, then the depth is (Rp/R*)^2, as (F_normal - F_transit)/F_normal = (Rp/R*)^2.\n\nIn the spotted case, the depth would be (F_max - F_min)/F_max ≈ 0.1036, so equate to (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.1036, which is as I calculated. Thus Rp/R* ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.\n\nTherefore, if we write radius ratio as 0.32 or so, maybe approximately 1/3 Sun’s radius (but this is larger than Jupiter). Wait, star’s radius is the Sun\'s, so 0.32 R_sun is 0.32 * 7e5 km ≈ 224,000 km. That in terms of exoplanet radius: Earth is ~6,400 km; Jupiter is ~70,000 km. So 224,000 km is roughly 3 Jupiter radii. True, such large exoplanets are rare, but calculation-wise, that\'s possible. But let recheck once again.\n\nBut is my assumption correct that Delta_F/F_max is (Rp/R*)^2? Because in exoplanet transit, the depth is Delta_F / F_0 = (Rp/R*)^2, where F_0 is the unobstructed flux. Here, in the spot modulation case, (F_max - F_min)/F_max is Delta_F with respect to maximum flux. Assuming that in the exoplanet case, the comparison, where without spots, the star\'s flux is F_max (hemisphere1) + F_hemisphere2_non_spot = F_hemi + hemisphere2_flux. But in the star\'s scenario, when it\'s unspotted, both hemispheres are emitting F_hemi. So for an unspotted star, the baseline flux is 2*F_hemi. So the exoplanet transits, and during transit, the flux is decreased by (Rp/R*)^2*(2*F_hemi). But in the rotational modulation case, (F_max - F_min) is (F_hemi - 0.8964*F_hemi)=0.1036*F_hemi, so Delta_F=0.1036*F_hemi, which is 0.0518*2*F_hemi (F1 + F2=2*F_hemi). Which is 0.0518*F_total_spotless. But wait, this would imply that the amplitude is 0.0518 (5% dip) as compared to the exoplanet which creates a depth (Rp/R*)^2 compared to total flux.\n\nTherefore, perhaps wrong.\n\nAlternatively, to compare the peak-to-peak amplitude in spotted star (peak is F_hemi, valley is 0.8964*F_hemi), but usually the mean flux of the spotted star would maybe F_total = F_hemi + F_hemi_spotted = F_hemi + 0.8964*F_hemi = 1.8964*F_hemi. (Not sure.) So when the star with spots emits 1.8964*F_hemi on average (luminosity-wise), but the observed flux when looking at different hemispheres is F_hemi and 0.8964*F_hemi. If normalized to the star\'s average flux, then the variations would be (F_hemi - 0.8964*F_hemi)/1.8964*F_hemi ≈ (0.1036/1.8964) ≈ 0.0546, 5.46%, so that would equate to exoplanet transit depth of (Rp/R*)^2 ≈ 0.0546, Rp/R* ≈ 0.234.\n\nAlternatively, in the exoplanet case, when transiting an unspotted star, to create a similar depth. The problem states to produce the same amplitude signal in the star\'s light curve if the star was NOT covered by spots. So NOT considering the rotational modulation, but the dip caused by a transiting planet. So in that case, the transit depth is (Rp/R*)^2.\n\nBut in the spots case, if we ignore spots but try to interpret variations in rotational modulation (which in reality is caused by spots changing visibility) as a transit, the depth would need to match “same amplitude signal”... Probably delta F / F corresponds to either where F is the maximum flux, so my first result of 0.1036, so Rp/R*≈0.32.\n\nBut that\'s conflicting. Depending on the considered F in the relative amplitude.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I’m overcomplicating, let\'s check examples online.\n\nThe change in flux from spots appearing and disappearing would be characterized by:\n\n% change in flux = [ (1 - f + f*(T_spots / T_star)^4 ) ] for a star where fraction f of total surface is covered; but no, in our case spots are only on one hemisphere.\n\nAh, here\'s the crux: it\'s rotational modulation.\n\nThe maximum flux is when the observer\'s viewpoint is on the opposite side of the star from the spotted hemisphere, so seeing the full unspotted hemisphere.\n\nThe minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. If the star\'s total flux without spots is F0, then with spots, when the spotted hemisphere is toward us, the flux is F0/2 * (1 - f + f*(T_spot / T_eff)^4), where f is the spot coverage. Here, f is 20%, but applied to half the star.\n\nBut if f is 20% of the star then with one hemisphere partly spotted, perhaps it would be 10% coverage. Wait, upthread we considered f_total = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.\n\nSo considering to。modarious models.\n\nWait here’s a formula:\n\nThe relative flux variation due to spots is ΔF / F ≈ ( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 )) / (4 - 3f(1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)) ).\n\nBut I might need to refer to standard models.\n\nAlternatively, in simpler terms, when a star has a flux F0 when no spots, the flux when portion f of the surface is covered with cooler spots is F = F0 [1 - f*(1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ) ]\n\nBut since the spots are on only one hemisphere, then as the star rotates, this would lead to variation. So in the case where the entire star isn\'t in view (much like with binary stars), here you have hemisphere\'s contributions varying.\n\nSo when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the flux from that hemisphere is F_hemi_spotted = F_hemi * [ 1 - f_hemispheric*(1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) ]\n\nWhere f_hemispheric is 0.2 in this case. The other hemisphere is at full brightness.\n\nFor f_hemispheric ≈0.2.\n\nF_min (spotted hemisphere in view) = F_hemi * [1 - 0.2*(1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ]\n\n=(1/2)*F0 * [1 - 0.2*(1 - (0.482)) ]\n\n=0.5*F0 * [1 - 0.2*0.518 ]\n\n=0.5*F0 * [1 - 0.1036 ]\n\n=0.5 * F0 * 0.8964\n\n=0.4482*F0.\n\nF_max (unspotted hemisphere in view) =0.5*F0 (since only half the star\'s surface is visible at a time in any configuration? No, assuming star is a sphere which we see as a disk; hemisphere facing towards us is what contributes – no, actually only half the star is visible at a time, regardless of spots. However, when the spotted hemispHere is in view, that\'s 0.5*A of the star covered in spots at 20% filling. To compute flux, integrated over the disc.\n\nWait but the integration over the visible hemisphere\'s intensities.\n\nHowever treating this problem as uniform brightness across hemispheres. When things are not uniform (brightness varies in patches) it could get complex, but assuming uniform brightness on each unspotted and spotted areas. For simplicity, ignoring limb-darkening and assuming every surface element of the star\'s photosphere emits isotropically with intensity I.\n\nIn such a case, if hemisphere A is partially covered with spots (20% coverage) with Intensity_spot = (T_spot / Teff)^4 * I, where I is the unspotted intensity.\n\nThen, Flux when viewing hemisphere A is F_A = [0.8 * I + 0.2 * I * (T_spot / Teff)^4 ] * A_hemisphere, and similarly F_B [unspotted] = I * A_hemisphere.\n\nIt depends on how the exposure of the spots is from our viewing angle.\n\nBut if the star\'s spotted hemisphere is viewed end-on, then exactly 0.2 of that hemisphere is spotting. But since the projected area integrand over the visible hemisphere complicates it. Wait: But perhaps the problem uses a simplified average whereby when a spot is on the visible hemisphere, it\'s coverage as projected is the filling factor.\n\nAlternatively, this is a common approximation when spots are spread across the surface.\n\nBut perhapsProblem states that there’s one hemisphere with 20% coverage. In reality, spots could be distributed in latitude and longitude such that when the star rotates and that hemisphere faces Earth, the total spotted area (projected onto the visible hemisphere) is 20% of that hemisphere.\n\nAssume the period is such that over the rotation period, we have maximum to minimum flux based on where the spotted hemisphere is. This is understood as similar to the transit case, with the brightness drop when the spotted side is viewed.\n\nSolving through this, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, flux is F_max = I * A_hemi (total from that hemisphere).

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the observed spots, we need to equate the flux variation caused by the spots to the transit depth of an exoplanet.

1. **Flux Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star has a hemisphere with 20% spot coverage. The effective temperature of the star (Teff) is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler (Tspot = 5000 K).
   - When the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the flux from that hemisphere is reduced. The flux from the spotted hemisphere is given by:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = 0.8 \cdot F_{\text{hemi}} + 0.2 \cdot F_{\text{hemi}} \cdot \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4
     \]
   - Substituting the temperatures:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = F_{\text{hemi}} \left[0.8 + 0.2 \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4\right]
     \]
   - Calculating \(\left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \approx 0.482\):
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} \approx F_{\text{hemi}} \left[0.8 + 0.2 \cdot 0.482\right] = F_{\text{hemi}} \cdot 0.8964
     \]

2. **Flux Variation Amplitude**:
   - The maximum flux (F_max) is from the unspotted hemisphere: \(F_{\text{max}} = F_{\text{hemi}}\).
   - The minimum flux (F_min) is from the spotted hemisphere: \(F_{\text{min}} \approx 0.8964 \cdot F_{\text{hemi}}\).
   - The relative flux variation is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = \frac{F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}}{F_{\text{max}}} = 1 - 0.8964 = 0.1036
     \]

3. **Equivalent Exoplanet Transit Depth**:
   - The transit depth caused by an exoplanet is given by \(\left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2\). Setting this equal to the flux variation amplitude:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1036
     \]
   - Solving for \(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
     \]

### Final Answer
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \(\boxed{0.32}\).

First, we need to compute the flux ratio when spots are present. The total flux from the unspotted hemisphere is straightforward. For the spotted hemisphere, since 20% of its area is cooler, the flux is reduced by a factor dependent on the temperature difference.

Computing flux contributions:

Flux from unspotted hemisphere: F_unspotted = 0.5 * L_total

Flux from spotted hemisphere: F_spotted = 0.5 * (0.8*L_total + 0.2*L_spot)
Where L_spot is the luminosity of the spotted regions compared to the unspotted. Since L is proportional to T^4, L_spot = (5000/6000)^4 * L_normal_region = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482

Wait, but actually each spot contributes (T_spot/T_eff)^4 times flux per unit area. So the flux from the spotted hemisphere is F_spotted = 0.5 * [0.8 * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4] / T_eff^4 * L_total * 0.5 ?

Wait maybe another approach is better. Let me consider the star’s total luminosity as the sum of spotted and unspotted parts when the spots are present.

But when the star is rotating and we observe it over time, the flux varies because half the star (unspotted) contributes more flux, and when the spotted half is facing us, flux is less. So the change in flux between maximum and minimum is the difference between the flux from unspotted hemisphere and the flux from spotted hemisphere.

Therefore, the variation (amplitude) would be (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_total, where F_total is usually the average flux when viewing the entire star. Wait, but when the star is spotted with 10% of its surface area covered, the average flux when the star is integrated over all rotation phases would be lower, but in this problem, are we comparing the maximum to minimum (peak to trough) variation caused by rotation? Because the question says the amplitude due to rotational modulation equals the transit amplitude.

Hmm. To clarify:

For spots, the amplitude is the difference between the maximum flux (spot-free hemisphere) and minimum flux (spotted hemisphere) divided by the average flux. Then, this amplitude is compared to the transit depth which is (Rp/R*)^2.

But perhaps, alternatively, the spot modulation amplitude is just the relative difference between the maximum and minimum flux? For example, (F_max - F_min)/F_max = δ, and in the exoplanet transit case, the depth is (F_normal - F_transit)/F_normal = (Rp/R*)^2.

Therefore, if the amplitude of the spot-induced variation is δ, then (F_max - F_min)/F_max = ΔL/L_max ≈ (Rp/R*)^2.

Assuming there are spots on 10% of the star's surface when they're present on half of the star, but this leads to a larger effect when rotated into view.

Wait, perhaps we need to model the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible vs. when it's not:

When spots are on the hemisphere facing us: F_min = 0.8 * F_hemi + 0.2 * (T_spot/T_eff)^4 * F_hemi

When spots are on the far side, the hemisphere facing us is unspotted: F_max = F_hemi

Therefore, F_max - F_min = F_hemi - [0.8 + 0.2*(T_spot/Teff)^4] * F_hemi = F_hemi * [1 - 0.8 - 0.2*(T_spot/Teff)^4)] = F_hemi * 0.2 [1 - (T_spot/Teff)^4)]

Then, the relative amplitude (assuming the star’s whole flux when unspotted is 2 * F_hemi, i.e., two hemispheres each of flux F_hemi when unspotted). But when the star is not rotating with spots, but in average (without spots), the total flux is 2 F_hemi. However, when one hemisphere is spotted, the hemisphere contributes 0.8 F_hemi + 0.2 F_spot, right? So actually, the average flux over the entire surface would be reduced even when considering the entire star. However, when only looking at the rotational modulation, we observe the variation from F_max to F_min. So how does the user compare it to the transit?

Ah, perhaps the question simplifies it: when the star is not covered by spots (hypothetically), then the exoplanet would cause a transit by blocking a part of the stellar disk, so the depth would be (Rp/R*)^2. The spot-induced variation (while the star is spotted but the spots are distributed such that rotational modulation causes a variation), when the star is Intrinsically unspotted. Hmm... no, the problem states that "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)", so the hypothetical exoplanet's transit depth would match the amplitude that would otherwise be caused by the spottedness.

Therefore, in the real scenario, when the star's spots are rotating into view, causing the star's brightness to vary between F_max (full brightness when spotted hemisphere is not observable) and F_min (spotted hemisphere is fully observable). The amplitude would be (F_max - F_min)/F_avg, perhaps, but sometimes people consider peak-to-peak amplitude as (F_max - F_min)/F_avg. On the other hand, exoplanet transit depth is a simple (Rp/R*)^2. So to have same "amplitude", when star is not spotted, we need the planet transit to cause a decrease in brightness equal to the spot-induced variation.

Therefore:

The amplitude caused by spots is (F_max - F_min)/F_max, perhaps. Let's confirm.

Assuming when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we have F_min. When it is not, F_max. The max minus min over the max would be (F_max - F_min)/F_max = Delta F/F_max. Exoplanet transit would cause Delta F/F = (Rp/R*)^2.

So perhaps we need to set these equal. Thus: (F_max - F_min)/F_max = (Rp/R*)^2.

Compute F_max and F_min.

F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us: the flux is 0.5 * L_total_spotless.

But wait, the total luminosity of the actual spotted star may be slightly lower than the unspotted one, but when the spots are not facing the observer, the observed flux from that hemisphere wouldn't be affected— You know, the total luminosity of the actual star (with spots) isn't necessarily directly part of this problem because the variation is due to the rotational modulation—so when the spots are not facing us, the hemisphere is emitting as if it has no spots? Wait, that doesn't make sense. How is the star in reality? The spots are always present on one hemisphere—rotating star, so depending on rotation phase, we see different hemispheres. Therefore, when the spots come into view, we see the lower flux from that hemisphere. The actual total luminosity of the star (if you average over the entire surface) is lower than the unspotted star. But when the exoplanet transits, the brightness variation is measured relative to the unobscured star. However, the problem states: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So the 'signal' in the exoplanet case would be (Rp/R*)^2. The spot-induced signal in the actual spotted star is a periodic modulation. For purpose of comparing "amplitude", assuming that spot-free star would mean the maximal flux is when the bright hemisphere is viewed, but in reality, stars without spots don't have that variation. Maybe the question is saying suppose the same star, and imagine the spots are not there, but to have someone who misinterprets the rotation modulation as an exoplanet transit would see a transit depth equivalent to that photometric amplitude. So perhaps equivalently, if you have a spot modulation (F_max - F_min) / F_max = (Rp/R*)^2.

Where F_max is the spot-free hemisphere flux and F_min is the flux from the spotted hemisphere.

Calculating F_max and F_min:

Suppose each hemisphere, when unspotted, has flux F0. Then, F_max is F0 (since the entire hemisphere is unspotted).

F_min is the sum of 80% of F0 and 20% of (T_spot / Teff)^4 * F0:

F_min = F0*(0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4).

Let’s compute (5000/6000)^4. 5000/6000 = 5/6. (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482. So,

F_min = F0*(0.8 + 0.2*0.482) = F0*(0.8 + 0.0964) ≈ F0*0.8964.

Therefore,

Delta_F = F_max - F_min = F0 - 0.8964*F0 = 0.1036*F0.

The relative amplitude is Delta_F / F_max = 0.1036 ≈ 10.36%.

Now, we need the transit depth to be 0.1036, so (Rp/R*)^2 ≈ 0.1036, so Rp/R* ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

Therefore, the planet would need to have a radius ≈32.2% of the star’s radius. Since the star has the same radius as the Sun, the exoplanet radius would be calculated relative to that. Wait, but Jupiter is about 0.1 R_sun, so this would be three times Jupiter's radius. That's super large, but perhaps correct?

Alternatively, double-check calculations.

Wait, maybe misunderstanding: when the entire hemisphere is NOT SPOTTED, but ahem. Wait, problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%". So 20% filling factor indicates that 20% (i.e., 20% area coverage) of the hemisphere is spots. So it's correct that 20% of half the star is covered. So 10% of the star’s total surface area.

But flux from spotted hemisphere:

The contribution of the hemisphere when spotted part is in view: the 80% emits as Teff (assuming that the "filling factor" is the areal coverage). The other 20% is spot with T_eff - 1000 = 5000K. So the flux from the spotted hemisphere:

F_spotted = 0.8 * F_hemi_spotless + 0.2 * (T_spot / T_eff)^4 * F_hemi_spotless.

So yes, where F_hemi_spotless is the flux from a hemisphere with no spots, that is, a normal hemisphere. So F_hemi_spotless = 0.5 * L_total(total unspotted star) *, but when we compute the contrast (delta F)/F, then perhaps let's think in terms of the flux of the entire (unspotted) star would be two hemispheres each emitting F_hemi. So F_total_spotless = 2*F_hemi. When the star is spotted, the total average flux (which I might not need here) would be 2*(0.9*F_hemi + 0.1*F_hemi* (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ), assuming that 10% of total surface area is spots. But wait, in the problem, only one hemisphere is 20% spotted. Therefore, hemisphere 1: 1 (in case of unspotted), total hemisphere_flux. Hemisphere 2: is 20% spotted, so its flux is 0.8*F_hemi + 0.2*F_hemi*(5000/6000)^4. Therefore, the average total flux is F_hemi + (0.8*F_hemi + 0.2*F_hemi*0.482) = F_hemi*(1 + 0.8 + 0.0964)≈ 1.8964.

But the modulation comes from when we look at hemisphere 1 (unspotted) gives F_hemi*1, hemisphere 2 (spotted) its observed flux is 0.8*F_hemi + 0.2*F_hemi*(0.482) as before, which is 0.8964*F_hemi.

So the difference between max (hemisphere 1) and min (hemisphere 2): 1 - 0.8964 = 0.1036 per hemisphere. The total flux when in neither hemisphere is visible would actually vary depending on viewing angle, but assuming the star's rotation axis is inclined edge-on, so we see different hemispheres.

But in reality, maximum flux would be when hemisphere 1 is facing us (F_max = F_hemi) and minimum when hemisphere 2 is facing us (F_min = 0.8964*F_hemi). So the observed variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_avg?

The question says to compare to an exoplanet transit which has a depth of (Rp/R*)^2 against an unspotted star. Therefore, the depth to compare would be (F_max - F_min)/F_max. Because when the exoplanet transits an unspotted star, then the depth is (Rp/R*)^2, as (F_normal - F_transit)/F_normal = (Rp/R*)^2.

In the spotted case, the depth would be (F_max - F_min)/F_max ≈ 0.1036, so equate to (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.1036, which is as I calculated. Thus Rp/R* ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

Therefore, if we write radius ratio as 0.32 or so, maybe approximately 1/3 Sun’s radius (but this is larger than Jupiter). Wait, star’s radius is the Sun's, so 0.32 R_sun is 0.32 * 7e5 km ≈ 224,000 km. That in terms of exoplanet radius: Earth is ~6,400 km; Jupiter is ~70,000 km. So 224,000 km is roughly 3 Jupiter radii. True, such large exoplanets are rare, but calculation-wise, that's possible. But let recheck once again.

But is my assumption correct that Delta_F/F_max is (Rp/R*)^2? Because in exoplanet transit, the depth is Delta_F / F_0 = (Rp/R*)^2, where F_0 is the unobstructed flux. Here, in the spot modulation case, (F_max - F_min)/F_max is Delta_F with respect to maximum flux. Assuming that in the exoplanet case, the comparison, where without spots, the star's flux is F_max (hemisphere1) + F_hemisphere2_non_spot = F_hemi + hemisphere2_flux. But in the star's scenario, when it's unspotted, both hemispheres are emitting F_hemi. So for an unspotted star, the baseline flux is 2*F_hemi. So the exoplanet transits, and during transit, the flux is decreased by (Rp/R*)^2*(2*F_hemi). But in the rotational modulation case, (F_max - F_min) is (F_hemi - 0.8964*F_hemi)=0.1036*F_hemi, so Delta_F=0.1036*F_hemi, which is 0.0518*2*F_hemi (F1 + F2=2*F_hemi). Which is 0.0518*F_total_spotless. But wait, this would imply that the amplitude is 0.0518 (5% dip) as compared to the exoplanet which creates a depth (Rp/R*)^2 compared to total flux.

Therefore, perhaps wrong.

Alternatively, to compare the peak-to-peak amplitude in spotted star (peak is F_hemi, valley is 0.8964*F_hemi), but usually the mean flux of the spotted star would maybe F_total = F_hemi + F_hemi_spotted = F_hemi + 0.8964*F_hemi = 1.8964*F_hemi. (Not sure.) So when the star with spots emits 1.8964*F_hemi on average (luminosity-wise), but the observed flux when looking at different hemispheres is F_hemi and 0.8964*F_hemi. If normalized to the star's average flux, then the variations would be (F_hemi - 0.8964*F_hemi)/1.8964*F_hemi ≈ (0.1036/1.8964) ≈ 0.0546, 5.46%, so that would equate to exoplanet transit depth of (Rp/R*)^2 ≈ 0.0546, Rp/R* ≈ 0.234.

Alternatively, in the exoplanet case, when transiting an unspotted star, to create a similar depth. The problem states to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve if the star was NOT covered by spots. So NOT considering the rotational modulation, but the dip caused by a transiting planet. So in that case, the transit depth is (Rp/R*)^2.

But in the spots case, if we ignore spots but try to interpret variations in rotational modulation (which in reality is caused by spots changing visibility) as a transit, the depth would need to match “same amplitude signal”... Probably delta F / F corresponds to either where F is the maximum flux, so my first result of 0.1036, so Rp/R*≈0.32.

But that's conflicting. Depending on the considered F in the relative amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I’m overcomplicating, let's check examples online.

The change in flux from spots appearing and disappearing would be characterized by:

% change in flux = [ (1 - f + f*(T_spots / T_star)^4 ) ] for a star where fraction f of total surface is covered; but no, in our case spots are only on one hemisphere.

Ah, here's the crux: it's rotational modulation.

The maximum flux is when the observer's viewpoint is on the opposite side of the star from the spotted hemisphere, so seeing the full unspotted hemisphere.

The minimum flux is when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer. If the star's total flux without spots is F0, then with spots, when the spotted hemisphere is toward us, the flux is F0/2 * (1 - f + f*(T_spot / T_eff)^4), where f is the spot coverage. Here, f is 20%, but applied to half the star.

But if f is 20% of the star then with one hemisphere partly spotted, perhaps it would be 10% coverage. Wait, upthread we considered f_total = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

So considering to。modarious models.

Wait here’s a formula:

The relative flux variation due to spots is ΔF / F ≈ ( f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 )) / (4 - 3f(1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)) ).

But I might need to refer to standard models.

Alternatively, in simpler terms, when a star has a flux F0 when no spots, the flux when portion f of the surface is covered with cooler spots is F = F0 [1 - f*(1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4 ) ]

But since the spots are on only one hemisphere, then as the star rotates, this would lead to variation. So in the case where the entire star isn't in view (much like with binary stars), here you have hemisphere's contributions varying.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer, the flux from that hemisphere is F_hemi_spotted = F_hemi * [ 1 - f_hemispheric*(1 - (T_spot / T_eff)^4) ]

Where f_hemispheric is 0.2 in this case. The other hemisphere is at full brightness.

For f_hemispheric ≈0.2.

F_min (spotted hemisphere in view) = F_hemi * [1 - 0.2*(1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) ]

=(1/2)*F0 * [1 - 0.2*(1 - (0.482)) ]

=0.5*F0 * [1 - 0.2*0.518 ]

=0.5*F0 * [1 - 0.1036 ]

=0.5 * F0 * 0.8964

=0.4482*F0.

F_max (unspotted hemisphere in view) =0.5*F0 (since only half the star's surface is visible at a time in any configuration? No, assuming star is a sphere which we see as a disk; hemisphere facing towards us is what contributes – no, actually only half the star is visible at a time, regardless of spots. However, when the spotted hemispHere is in view, that's 0.5*A of the star covered in spots at 20% filling. To compute flux, integrated over the disc.

Wait but the integration over the visible hemisphere's intensities.

However treating this problem as uniform brightness across hemispheres. When things are not uniform (brightness varies in patches) it could get complex, but assuming uniform brightness on each unspotted and spotted areas. For simplicity, ignoring limb-darkening and assuming every surface element of the star's photosphere emits isotropically with intensity I.

In such a case, if hemisphere A is partially covered with spots (20% coverage) with Intensity_spot = (T_spot / Teff)^4 * I, where I is the unspotted intensity.

Then, Flux when viewing hemisphere A is F_A = [0.8 * I + 0.2 * I * (T_spot / Teff)^4 ] * A_hemisphere, and similarly F_B [unspotted] = I * A_hemisphere.

It depends on how the exposure of the spots is from our viewing angle.

But if the star's spotted hemisphere is viewed end-on, then exactly 0.2 of that hemisphere is spotting. But since the projected area integrand over the visible hemisphere complicates it. Wait: But perhaps the problem uses a simplified average whereby when a spot is on the visible hemisphere, it's coverage as projected is the filling factor.

Alternatively, this is a common approximation when spots are spread across the surface.

But perhapsProblem states that there’s one hemisphere with 20% coverage. In reality, spots could be distributed in latitude and longitude such that when the star rotates and that hemisphere faces Earth, the total spotted area (projected onto the visible hemisphere) is 20% of that hemisphere.

Assume the period is such that over the rotation period, we have maximum to minimum flux based on where the spotted hemisphere is. This is understood as similar to the transit case, with the brightness drop when the spotted side is viewed.

Solving through this, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, flux is F_max = I * A_hemi (total from that hemisphere). When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, F_min = (0.8 * I + 0.2 * I * (5000/6000)^4) * A_hemi.

Relative difference: (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [1 - (0.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4) ]

Computing 5/6 is ~0.833,

So (5/6)^4 is approx. (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.482.

Thus:

[1 - (0.8 + 0.2*0.482)]=1 - (0.8 + 0.0964)=1 - 0.8964=0.1036.

So relative flux change is 10.36%. Exoplanet has a transit depth of (Rp/Rs)^2. So set to 0.1036 equal to this, Rp/Rs= sqrt(0.1036)= approx 0.322. So 0.32, in solar radii: 0.32 R_sun is 33 Earth radii, where Earth radius is in units of solar (~1/109), but no, Rp/Rstar is 0.32, so about 32% of the star's radius. Since Jupiter is ~0.1 R_sun, approx 3.2 Jupiter radii. Yes.

So the answer is approximately R_planet/R_star ≈ 0.32, which would be 32% of 0.32 in ratio. So answer is \boxed{0.32}.

Let\'s compute average flux.\n\nAverage flux over the rotational period: (F_unspotted + F_spotted)/2. But since over the period, each hemisphere points towards us equal time.\n\nWait ahem. The average flux F_avg would be (F_spotted + F_unspotted) / 2? Yes, assuming the star rotates such that each hemisphere is visible for half the period. So, average flux would balance both. Then, flux maximum is F_unspotted, flux minimum is F_spotted.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude (delta F) is F_unspotted - F_spotted. Then delta F / F_avg = (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / ( (F_unspotted + F_spotted)/2 ). This gives the fractional variation. However, if the problem refers to the dip in brightness when spots are present compared to when they are not, then potentially an astronomer would see the maximum decrease in brightness as (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted, similar to a transit where (F_star - F_obscured)/F_star is the depth.\n\nBut in the case of the exoplanet transit, the depth is (Rp/R*)^2. For spots, we need the signal to be equivalent. Since the setup implies "the same amplitude signal", perhaps the peak-to-peak variation (delta F) or the depth of the dip (when the spots are in view). The problem states it as periodic variations due to rotational modulation. When exoplanet transits, it\'s just the dip when the planet blocks light. Hence, to achieve the same amplitude, assuming that the dip from spots (F_avg - F_spotted) would equal the dip from transiting planet (F_star - F_occulted). So delta F equivalent.\n\nBut let\'s see. Let\'s recall in the exoplanet detection, if the planet is transiting, then the depth would be (Rp/R*)^2. Here, planets block light as (πRp²)/(πR*²) = (Rp/R*)^2. So I think the key is to express the fractional flux decrease caused by the spots\' presence when the spots are visible, and set that equal to the transit depth. Therefore, delta F / F is the fractional depth; so delta F / F = (Rp / R*)^2 for the planet.\n\nThus, we can equate delta F_spot / F_unspotted_equal = (Rp / R*)^2. Wait, but in the spot case, the delta F (when the spots are present) is from F_unspotted when no spots are visible, but actually whether the entire hemisphere is half covered. Wait, I need to check again.\n\nWait, no. When the spotted hemisphere is in view, it\'s (0.8 * T_one_hemi + 0.2 T_spot). When the other hemisphere is in view, it\'s full T_eff. The unspotted hemisphere here implies another hemisphere without spots. Is that actually the case? The problem specified One hemisphere is covered with 20% spotted. The other is not covered. Therefore, when spotted hemi is in view, flux is (0.8 * T_eff + 0.2 * T_spot) component. But all the star\'s flux is summed over the visible hemisphere, so clarifying:\n\nLuminosity for the spotted hemisphere:\nL_spot_hemi = (0.8 * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * sigma * Area_hemisphere.\n\nThe area_hemi is 2 pi R^2. Similarly, L_unspotted_hemi = sigma * T_eff^4 * 2 pi R^2.\n\nTherefore, when the hemisphere fully unspotted is visible, the star\'s flux is L_unspotted_hemi / (4 pi d^2) = sigma T_eff^4 * 2 pi R^2 / (4 pi d^2) = sigma T_eff^4 (R^2 / (2 d^2)).\n\nWhen the other hemisphere containing spots is facing us, it\'s L_spot_hemi / (4 pi d^2) = sigma (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) * 2 pi R^2 / (4 pi d^2) = sigma (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) * R^2 / (2 d^2).\n\nSo, delta_flux = (F_unspotted - F_spot) = sigma R^2 / (2 d^2) [ T_eff^4 - (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) ] = sigma R^2 / (2 d^2 ) * 0.2 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ).\n\nThen, the amplitude of variation (peak to trough) is (F_unspotted - F_spot) relative to F_avg. Because in observing brightness, star\'s apparent brightness oscillates between F_unspotted and F_spot.\n\nThough most literature measures amplitude as the difference over the average flux?\n\nThen, to get the amplitude similar to an exoplanet transit depth. For transits, depth is (Rp/R*)^2, because the planet covers a disk of area pi R_p^2 over the star’s disk area pi R*^2.\n\nTherefore, if spot-induced amplitude delta_flux / F_avg is similar to (Rp/R*)^2:\n\nA_spot = delta_flux / F_avg = [F_unspotted - F_spot] / F_avg.\n\nWe need to compute F_avg, for varying flux due to spots:\n\nSince over the rotation period, the star spends 50% of the time in F_unspotted and 50% in F_spot.\n\nF_avg = (F_unspotted + F_spot)/2.\n\nHence,\n\nA_spot = (F_unspotted - F_spot) / (F_avg)\n\n= (F_unspotted - F_spot) / [(F_unspotted + F_spot)/2] = 2 (F_unspotted - F_spot)/(F_unspotted + F_spot).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the amplitude refers to the depth seen when the spots are in view, which would be delta_flux / F_unspotted. That is, how much the flux drops when the spots come into view, relative to the unspotted maximum.\n\nIf done this way, then the fractional decrease is (F_unspotted - F_spot) / F_unspotted = delta_flux / F_unspotted.\n\nSimilarly, a planet\'s transit height amplitude is (Rp/R*)^2. So maybe equate those?\n\nYou need to figure which measure of amplitude they are referring to. The question says "the same amplitude signal in the star\'s light curve", so amplitude as in peak-to-trough variation? Alternatively, depth when the spotted hemisphere is facing.\n\nIn standard light curves for spots: when the spots are on the side facing us, brightness decreases, when they pass to the other side, brightness is normal. So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spot)/F_unspotted = 1 - (F_spot/F_unspotted). For exoplanet, it\'s 1 - (1 - (Rp/R*)^2) = (Rp/R*)^2.\n\nBut wait: Wait, actually planets TRANSIT in front, meaning they block some light. So if the planet\'s area is (Rp/R*)^2, the flux during transit is F = F_star * (1 - (Rp/R*)^2).\n\nTherefore, the depth is (Rp/R*)^2. So during transit, depth is (Rp/R*)^2. So if the spot causes a depth of (F_max - F_min)/F_max = (F_unspotted - F_spot)/F_unspotted. So that is:\n[ (sigma Teff^4 * Area_hemi / (4 pi d^2)) - (sigma (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 Tspot^4) * Area_hemi / (4 pi d^2)) ] / (sigma Teff^4 * Area_hemi / (4 pi d^2)).\n\nThe Area_hemi / (4 pi d^2) and sigma cancels.\n\nSo:\n\n[ Teff^4 - (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 Tspot^4) ] / Teff^4 = [0.2 Teff^4 - 0.2 Tspot^4]/ Teff^4 = 0.2 * (1 - (Tspot/Teff)^4 )\n\nTherefore, spot depth would be 0.2*(1 - (5000/6000)^4).\n\nCompute that first:\n\n5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈0.83333, so (5/6)^4 ≈ (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.\n\nTherefore, the spot depth is 0.2*(1 - 0.48225) = 0.2*0.51775≈0.10355. So about 10.35% relative depth.\n\nTherefore, equivalently, a planet with depth (Rp/R*)^2=0.10355, so Rp/R*≈√0.10355≈0.3218. So, roughly 32% of the star\'s radius.\n\nBut before we proceed, check all the steps again.\n\nFirst, the spotted hemisphere:\n\nFractional coverage of spots per hemisphere is 20%, so their area is 0.2*(2πR²) = 0.4πR². Then compare to the total hemisphere area, which is 2πR². So in terms of flux contribution, when the spotted hemisphere is facing:\n\nEach unspotted part of that hemisphere (80%) emits as 6000K, 20% spots emit as 5000K.\n\nThen the flux contributions, since flux from a surface element on a star we receive is proportional to the surface area times T^4. Ignore limb darkening since presumably the problem expects to assume uniform brightness except for spots.\n\nThus, for the spotted hemisphere:\n\nFlux_spotted_hemisphere = [ (0.8 * T_eff^4 ) + (0.2 * T_spot^4 ) ] * (Area_hemisphere)\n\nFlux unspotted_hemisphere is just T_eff^4 * Area_hemisphere.\n\nFlux from each hemisphere would then be (using R_sun\'s, etc., but since we ratio against each other, factors cancel. So:\n\nDifference in flux between facing the unspotted hemisphere vs the spotted one is when comparing the flux.\n\nBut stars in reality don\'t go dark on the far side. Wait hold on. Wait, in actuality, the star\'s total flux (when observed from afar) integrates over the entire surface. However, when the spot is on the visible hemisphere, part of the surface is cooler. However, when the spot is on the far side, you don\'t see them. Hence, in reality, the brightness variation is due to the fraction of each hemisphere spotted over the rotation period.\n\nHmm. Wait, the confusion arises from this. Wait, actually, the star emits light in all directions. It\'s considered periodically varying as a result of rotation, meaning we cannot directly observe the far side but whether or not the spots affect the overall emissions. Wait, no—this seems confused.\n\nWait, another approach. For rotational modulation. When a star has a spot group, as it rotates, we see more or fewer spots in our view, changing the brightness. If spots are on only half the star (one hemisphere), then when that hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots (which are darker) and when it rotates away, we see the clean hemisphere.\n\nBut total flux received from the star would vary as that hemisphere faces towards us.\n\nBut in that sense: stars\' light as integrated over the entire surface would only depend on the area visible, but in this case, star is considered to be such that we see it as a point source. So as it rotates, we can\'t resolve different parts, but changes in actual flux based on how much of its surface is spotted. This seems non-Roche lobe, but if a star rotates with a darker spot region (half) that when visible, reduces the flux. However, in standard models, the brightness variation depends on how much the spotted area affects the overall flux whenever it\'s visible.\n\nBut with a single hemisphere spotted, when that side is facing towards us, part is dark. When it\'s not, the bright side faces us, so maximum flux. The *projected area* over the visible hemisphere affects the total flux, but since when spots are on the far side, they don\'t subtract from the flux. So when a star is spotted on one hemisphere, as it rotates, when the spots rotate into the viewing field, we lose flux, and when rotated out again, we gain it.\n\nBut in reality, even standard calculations suggest there is fractional variation given the fill factor? Wait. Let\'s refer back to standard work here.\n\nActually, the spottedness effect on flux A(t) is:\n\nA(t) = (Total Emission from visible hemisphere with spots)/(Total Emission from full hemisphere without spots).\n\nAssuming the spots are on the visible hemisphere and their contribution (or in this case the lower contribution) based on where they’re located on the sphere. However, in our scenario, when one hemisphere is 20% covered, the effective emission when that hemisphere faces us is (1 - f)*T_eff^4 + f*T_spot^4 multiplied by the area of the hemisphere?\n\nAlternatively, since in point source observations, the discussion of fill factors relates to projection.\n\nA better way is to model it as, assuming the hemispheric spot group, of area covering 20% of that hemisphere.\n\nWhen the hemisphere is facing us, the projected area for the star is a circle. The spots. 20% of the hemisphere. So, the spots occupy a region which is, when projected in our line of sight, also that 20% as a circular region.\n\nBut considering projection effects, 20% of a hemisphere\'s area is 0.2 * 2πR^2. The projected area we see if it\'s not uniformly spread. Wait, actually, for flux– which is position-dependent (limb darkening is a missing factor somewhere here), but maybe again the problem is approximating. If all spots are spread equally over the hemisphere, their projected area when viewed face-on is (maybe 0.2 * πR²). That is, if they are on a hemisphere (half the surface area), but when projected onto the visible disk, at the center. So total projected area of spots when the hemisphere is visible is 0.2 * (the area of the hemisphere we\'re looking at). Hemisphere\'s area is 2πR^2. The greatest circle we see is πR^2, hence 0.2 * πR^2 (assuming spots centered on the projected disk). Hmm.\n\nBut in any case, I think the problem wants us to think in terms of the loss of flux due to 20% of a hemisphere emitting less. Maybe we don\'t need to be accurate in terms of projection effects and just compute that 20% of the radiant flux from that hemisphere is cooler. Since flux is quantized per unit surface area. So spots and their filling factor effect.\n\nAlternatively, since varying with the star’s rotation, the problem can be simplified with the assumption that one hemisphere is 20% spotted (T-T 1000K cool) and the other is unspotted. Therefore, when the spotted hem is visible, the star is not quite as bright as when it\'s hidden.\n\nTherefore, the emission difference occurs between maximum (unspotted) and minimum (spotted hemisphere) flux. So:\n\nL_max = sigma * T_eff^4 * (0.5 * A_total) + sigma * (0.5 * A_total) =\n\nWait, the star is half-spotted (no, spot covers 20% of one hem). Wait. No, spot covers 20% of one hemisphere. So:\n\n*Total emitting area:\n\nUnspotted hemisphere: 0.5 * A_total (if entire hemisphere was unspotted, it\'s 2πR², but with:\n\nWait, given A_total equal to 4πR².\n\nBut to calculate flux when a certain hemisphere is visible:\n\nBut stars are three-dimensional, so even if spots are distributed over a hemisphere, when facing toward us, we see a full disk, and the same when facing away. But spots on the other hemisphere would contribute unless they are dark.\n\nBut with the given modeling: when the "spotted" hemisphere is facing us, part of its light is blocked (20% are cooler spots). When the other (unspotted) hemisphere faces us, we receive full emission. Assuming we can\'t see the far hemisphere\'s spots since they are on the back (spherical nature should make some of them hidden or partially visible depending on projection, but assuming they are entirely hidden or not). However, with one full hemisphere (ocurring 50% of the star\'s surface) having its spots only on the front.\n\nIt gets confusing here, perhaps better to ignore geometry and focus on filling factor.\n\nAlternatively, considering a simplified model where when spots are on the visible hemisphere (which is 50% of the time), then the effective blocked flux is the brightness drop from:\n\nTotal flux in unspotted state: L = 4πR²σT_eff^4.\n\nActually, when you have stars, their total luminosity is 4πR²σT_eff^4. But if a fraction, x, of the surface has temp T_spot, then:\n\nL = (1 - x)4πR²σT_eff^4 + x4πR²σT_spot^4.\n\nBut in this case, since only 10% (since 20% of one hem) of the surface is spotted:\n\nWait, problem is so crucial here.\n\nIf only 20% of one hemisphere is spotted: one hemisphere is 2πR² (since surface area is 4πR²). Spots are on 20% of that, spot area 0.2*2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spotted area is 0.4πR²; of the entire surface (4πR²), that\'s 10% covered.\n\nTherefore, x under total surface is 0.1. So, T=6000K of 90% of surface, and 10% at 5000K. So Total L = (0.9 * T_eff^4 + 0.1 T_spot^4 ) * 4πR²σ.\n\nHowever, luminosity is not variable if the star is static. But in the problem statement, there is periodic variation due to *rotational* modulation—changes in the *observed* flux. So why is that?\n\nBecause when the spots are not front-and-center, we can see them, but they modify the light via lower emission by being in the hemisphere. But actually, we see the star\'s entire surface over time. Actually, it\'s tricky. Unless latitude-based. Perhaps the spot is co-rotating such that sometimes they face towards us (when on the facing hemisphere;when rotating periodically. Then, but more realistically, star is rotating with some inclination, track spots rotating into and out of view, inducing brightness variations. So the flux goes down by the spots\' area times delta T, depending on how much of the hemisphere we see (projection).\n\nBut perhaps the problem simplifies, assuming means that when spots are visible vs. not. I think the problem might need simplified assumptions. Confusion again arises here.\n\nBut to move forward, suppose that:\n\nThe key formula when talking about spots leading to variability is delta L / L = ( L_max - L_min ) / L_average. So (Same formula as maximum variation relative to the average luminosity.\n\nBut due to spots: if the star\'s unspotted hemisphere\'s flux is L1, and spotted hemisphere\'s flux is L2. Since each hemisphere is observed half the time, the average is (L1 + L2)/2. The peak-to-peak variation is L1 - L2.\n\nFormula for delta L / L which would be (L1 - L2)/average = (L1 - L2)/[(L1 + L2)/2] = 2(L1 - L2)/(L1 + L2). The flux difference.\n\nBut relative to when doing a similar transit; which depth is (Rp/R*)^2. The question is what exoplanet to cause same flux change with delta L / L.\n\nThus, 2(L1 - L2)/(L1 + L2) should be calculated and set equal to (R_p / R*)^2.\n\nFirst, compute L1 and L2.\n\nGiven:\n\n- The unspotted hemisphere (Hem1) facing in L1.\n\nBut each hemisphere is 2πR². But flux is integrated over entire visible disk, which for a centered hemisphere would be predominantly where we’re facing. But given the star being a sphere, the total flux emitted is the same all the time (it\'s finite). Wait! That can\'t be. How?\n\nWait a critical confusion: all points on a star contribute to the luminosity. Spots (whether facing the observer or not) contribute less as Teff, waiting, but luminosity is integrated over all directions. But star’s total luminosity (intrinsic brightness) would not depend on the orientation (But if axisymmetric spots don\'t affect the total). If they’re localized, different? Even more confusing.\n\nWait, but in practice, if a part of the star\'s surface is spotted with lower temperature, then if these spots are facing towards us, another hemisphere. When spotted hemisphere is towards us, you "observe" lower flux. Stellar luminosity is 4πR²sigma(Teff^4)*(1 - x) over by x coming from spots. Wait, but the star\'s total luminosity is actually fixed. Unless there are spots—no, wait. The star as an emitter converts some arrangement of spotted regions, meaning lower emission globally? But that only holds if spots change total radiation. But spotted regions are cooler, thus less effective emitting but have long-term lowering.\n\nWait the star\'s total luminosity with spots must account for the entire surface.\n\nBut given spots have lower temps, so integrating over entire star (who is uniformly rotating with spots in one hemishphere). But stellar irradiation viewed from Earth would vary as the spot-filled hemisphere contributes when turned towards us.\n\nSo there, we view part of the spotted spectrum versus normal.\n\nSo basically, when the star spot has one hemisphere mottled with spots, when we observe that hemisphere, we get a different flux than when it\'s facing the other way. Therefore, our flux (apparent) seems modulated.\n\nBut to model the max to min luminosity difference in time-series for an unresolved star. So to an observer away from the star, the flux would be L = Integral over visible disk (sigma T^4 dA cos(theta)/pi) ? Wait, integrated over visible hemisphere plus considering brightness distribution as per limb darkening, but this is more complixated and the problem expects simplistic calculation. Let me refer to repeated considerations.\n\nIf we parameterize the stellar flux observed from Earth as F when the spotted hemisphere is facing us:\n\nF_spot = (T_eff^4 * (1 - f) + T_spot^4 * f) * (Area facing us) * sigma / (4 pi d^2); ignoring exact geometrical view.\n\nBut simplistically, the star\'s apparent flux is proportional to brightness (T^4) times the visible (projected) area.\n\nBut the area facing us is its apparent disk, πR². The question is if the entire disk is represented, but with various spots to block the flux.\n\nBut we must take into account how much of the disk is spotted when different hemisphere faces us. But here the complicacy arises. To have a reasonable approach, perhaps we model the original problem as follows.\n\nThe star with radius R has one hemisphere (50% of surface area) spotted with filling factor 20%, which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So 10% of the entire star\'s surface is spotted.\n\nBut when observing the star, how much of those spots are actually visible on the disk?\n\nWait when the spotted hemisphere turns toward us, the proportion might differ.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps ideas introduced in textbook examples:\n\nThe textbook case: light variation of a star rotating with a single, circular spot. The time-dependent flux thereby depends on longitude of the spot. Ignoring inclinations and latitudes, if the spot is on the equator and star\'s spinning edge-on, we\'d see the spot completely obscuring part of the star\'s disk as it moves face-on, leading to flux proportional to relative areas, minimally when the spot is centered. So maximum drop-off.\n\nBut our case here is one hemisphere has 20% filled with spots. Not a single spot, but distributed covering 20% of that petal. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, though, perhaps integrating spatially – the filling factor on the hemisphere. The problem states that dark spots have a filling factor of 20% over one hemisphere.\n\nEnvision hemisphere has 20% spots, so that when facing toward us, 20% of the observed disk is covered with spots. I think area-wise: if the hemisphere\'s total area is 2πR², as seen by an external observer when translating to a projection. That is, the disk\'s projection area is πR². Therefore, 20% of the half hemisphere\'s surface area might convert to perhaps 10% disk coverage (since projected).\n\nBut this becomes complex in converting area to flat projection. Instead, ignoring projection effects, if we consider that when the hemisphere is oriented toward Earth, 20% of that hemisphere\'s surface is covered with spots, whose flux is 5000K instead of 6000K.\n\nSo the observed flux would be, in the case of spotted hemisphere being towards us:\n\nF_spot = sigma * T_eff^4 * (area of hemisphere * (1 - f_spot)) + sigma * T_spot^4 * (area of hemisphere * f_spot)} / (4 pi d²). But aquestàrying why divided by 4 pi d square? Because each point on the star emits radiation into 4 pi, we observe only that portion? Wait flux is σT^4 per unit area. Total flux from the hemisphere would be ∑ all elements sigma T^4 dA divided into 4pi since each surface element emits in all 4pi steradians.\n\nAlternatively, observers receive flux from the hemisphere visible towards us (to each hemisphere phase). Confusion steps underscoring unfamiliarity. Maybe surface brightness is sigma*T^4/pi for limb darkening but simplified to sigma*T^4 else.\n\nAlternatively, we main whiteboard summarize:\n\nF_instantanous = (Normal flux * (1 - fractional_area_spots) * (T_eff)^{4} + fractional_area_spots * T_spot^4) relative.\n\nBut given the goal of creating an equivalent to transit depth. So let\'s say maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is towards us.\n\nWhile minimum flux when the spotted hemisphere is towards us. Flux difference is delta_F = F_max - F_min. As the star rotates. In exoplanet\'s transit case, delta_F = F_disk = (Rp / R*)^2 * F_star.\n\nSet F_max - F_min = delta_F = (Rp/R*)^2 * F_max. Or photometric depth, transit as a fractional dip.\n\nSo proceed to compute these.\n\nFirst, let\'s find F_max = F_unspotted. This is when the spotted hemisphere is facing away.\n\nF_unspotted is the flux from half the star\'s surface (unspotted hemisphere) and the other hemisphere (spotted), but since the spots are facing away from us: so contribution of T_spot is zero? Because they are on the hemisphere facing away. Hence:\n\nF_unspotted = (Emissivity of unspotted hemisphere) + (Emissivity of spotted hemisphere[[[BUT T_spot is less]]] — but is the far hemisphere contributing as darks too; but naively, if you cannot see their spots, their regular emission.)\n\nWait, total flux is that 4 pi R² sigma T_eff^4 —actual overall star\'s output. Confusing here. The observer can see surface brightness of various star elements. The problem arises when spots are pervading different longitudinal areas but hidden when viewed from Earth.\n\nBut in reality, when spots are on the hemisphere away from Earth, their radiation is not directed toward us. Wait, but stars\' radiation emits in all directions;*each surface element emits in all directions. Therefore, integrating over the entire surface when spotted on one hemisphere. However, for *apparent* flux verses star’s true luminosity. Semi-mixed.\n\nTherefore to approximate apparent flux received by observers:\n\nThe observer sees (in a simplified case) half of the spots in the star: those facing us. That is, spots on the earth-facing hemisphere contribute to the observed flux.\n\nThe problem\'s systemic dificulty is defining exact equation for flux variation.\n\nBut why do stars with spots present variation in light curves if the spots are out of our view?\n\n No, possible si a star has spots distributed such that their affected region and the star\'s rotation causes us to see more or fewer spots.\n\nBut suppose the entire spotted area is on one hemisphere: so if spotted hemisphere turned towards us or not. If the star’s axis is aligned so that hemisphere be rotating in and out of view as of Earth’s perspective.\n\nFor example, if the star\'s rotational axis is perpendicular to our line of sight so that hemisphere stays visible as it rotates （ but fix a particular spotted hemisphere facing) hm.\n\n No. In reality, it depends on how the star’s rotation brought different hemispheres into view.\n\nAssume the star always presents the same hemisphere (aligned like our tidally-locked with Earth perspective). Then the flux doesn’t vary. But if star\'s axis misaligned, and when of equatorial viewing, we see spots come into view as it rotates.\n\nBut inany case，if spots cover 20% of a hemisphere, when projected, at what fraction does that cover? A bit tricky.\n\nGiven confusion and time limitations imposed by natural brain speed, need to move but recalling the parameter mentioned: the answer might be 0.3-something.\n\nBut step succinctly.\n\nMethod:\n\n- Find flux dip when spotted hemisphere is facing us. DeltaF = F_unspotted - F_spotted.\n\nDeltaF / F_unspotted ~ (Rp/Rstar)^2.\n\nCompute deltaF is due to the fraction of hemisphere covered with spots, as function of temperature effect. So:\n\nF_spotted = F_unspotted * [0.8 + 0.2*(Tspot / Teff)^4 ]\n\nThus:\n\nDeltaF = F_un - F_spotted = F_un (1 - [0.8+0.2*(Tspot/Teff)^4 ]) = F_un * 0.2 (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )\n\nAs before. So:\n\n(DeltaF / F_un) = 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈0.1035….\n\nSet this equal to (R_p/Rs)^2, then solve:\n\nRp/Rs= sqrt(0.10355)= approx 0.322, so about 32% radius of the star. Or roughly half of Jupiter to the Sun (Sun radius 7e5 km, Jupiter 7e4 km— ~0.1, but bigger than Earth). But here, hypothetical planet would be 0.32 times.\n\nBut the premise sets the amplitude of brightness variation due to spot modulation corresponds to an exoplanet transit. Hence the answer is approx 0.32 Rstar. So, approximately Rp/Rs=0.32. Compute accurately the real value:\n\n5000 / 6000=5/6, so (5/6)^4=625/1296≈0.482253\n\nTherefore，1 - 0.482253=0.517747\n\nMultiply by 0.2: 0.2*0.517747≈0.10355\n\nSquare root? 0.10355<> about a bit less than 0.32 calculate sqrt(0.10355) as exactly:\n\n0.32²=0.1024. Hence, sqrt is between 0.32 (0.1024) and 0.3219 (0.10355). Compute precise:\n\nAssume a^2=0.10355, solve a: so, 0.32 error to 0.32:\n\n0.32^2 = 0.1024. 0.10355 -0.1024= 0.00115.\n\nEach approximate 0.0001 for a small delta.\n\nApproximate, (a + dx)^2= a² + 2a dx + dx²≈ a² + 2a dx.\n\nWe want a=0.32, a²=0.1024. To reach 0.10355,  difference is 0.00115.\n\nThen 2a dx≈0.00115 → dx≈0.00115 / (2*0.32)=0.00115 / 0.64≈0.001796\n\nThus, a≈0.32 +0.001796≈0.3218. So, appr 0.3218.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star (R_pl/R_star) that would produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve as the observed spots, we need to compare the flux variation caused by the spots to the flux variation caused by an exoplanet transit.

1. **Flux Variation due to Spots**:
   - The star has one hemisphere with 20% coverage of spots (filling factor 20%).
   - The effective temperature of the star (T_eff) is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler (T_spot = 5000 K).
   - The flux from the unspotted hemisphere is proportional to T_eff^4.
   - The flux from the spotted hemisphere is a combination of the unspotted area (80%) and the spotted area (20%).

   The flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing the observer (F_spot) and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing the observer (F_unspot) is calculated as follows:
   \[
   F_{\text{spot}} = \left(0.8 \times T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.2 \times T_{\text{spot}}^4\right) \times \frac{\sigma R^2}{2d^2}
   \]
   \[
   F_{\text{unspot}} = T_{\text{eff}}^4 \times \frac{\sigma R^2}{2d^2}
   \]

   The flux variation (ΔF) is:
   \[
   \Delta F = F_{\text{unspot}} - F_{\text{spot}} = \frac{\sigma R^2}{2d^2} \left(T_{\text{eff}}^4 - (0.8 T_{\text{eff}}^4 + 0.2 T_{\text{spot}}^4)\right)
   \]

2. **Relative Flux Variation**:
   The relative flux variation due to the spots is:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspot}}} = 0.2 \left(1 - \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4\right)
   \]
   Substituting the temperatures:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspot}}} = 0.2 \left(1 - \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4\right)
   \]
   Calculating the temperature term:
   \[
   \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4 \approx 0.48225
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspot}}} = 0.2 \times (1 - 0.48225) = 0.2 \times 0.51775 = 0.10355
   \]

3. **Equating to Exoplanet Transit Depth**:
   The flux variation due to an exoplanet transit is given by \( \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 \). Setting this equal to the flux variation due to spots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.10355
   \]
   Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
   \]

Thus, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately:
\[
\boxed{0.32}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Perhaps use max - min over average. Let's compute average flux.

Average flux over the rotational period: (F_unspotted + F_spotted)/2. But since over the period, each hemisphere points towards us equal time.

Wait ahem. The average flux F_avg would be (F_spotted + F_unspotted) / 2? Yes, assuming the star rotates such that each hemisphere is visible for half the period. So, average flux would balance both. Then, flux maximum is F_unspotted, flux minimum is F_spotted.

Therefore, the amplitude (delta F) is F_unspotted - F_spotted. Then delta F / F_avg = (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / ( (F_unspotted + F_spotted)/2 ). This gives the fractional variation. However, if the problem refers to the dip in brightness when spots are present compared to when they are not, then potentially an astronomer would see the maximum decrease in brightness as (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted, similar to a transit where (F_star - F_obscured)/F_star is the depth.

But in the case of the exoplanet transit, the depth is (Rp/R*)^2. For spots, we need the signal to be equivalent. Since the setup implies "the same amplitude signal", perhaps the peak-to-peak variation (delta F) or the depth of the dip (when the spots are in view). The problem states it as periodic variations due to rotational modulation. When exoplanet transits, it's just the dip when the planet blocks light. Hence, to achieve the same amplitude, assuming that the dip from spots (F_avg - F_spotted) would equal the dip from transiting planet (F_star - F_occulted). So delta F equivalent.

But let's see. Let's recall in the exoplanet detection, if the planet is transiting, then the depth would be (Rp/R*)^2. Here, planets block light as (πRp²)/(πR*²) = (Rp/R*)^2. So I think the key is to express the fractional flux decrease caused by the spots' presence when the spots are visible, and set that equal to the transit depth. Therefore, delta F / F is the fractional depth; so delta F / F = (Rp / R*)^2 for the planet.

Thus, we can equate delta F_spot / F_unspotted_equal = (Rp / R*)^2. Wait, but in the spot case, the delta F (when the spots are present) is from F_unspotted when no spots are visible, but actually whether the entire hemisphere is half covered. Wait, I need to check again.

Wait, no. When the spotted hemisphere is in view, it's (0.8 * T_one_hemi + 0.2 T_spot). When the other hemisphere is in view, it's full T_eff. The unspotted hemisphere here implies another hemisphere without spots. Is that actually the case? The problem specified One hemisphere is covered with 20% spotted. The other is not covered. Therefore, when spotted hemi is in view, flux is (0.8 * T_eff + 0.2 * T_spot) component. But all the star's flux is summed over the visible hemisphere, so clarifying:

Luminosity for the spotted hemisphere:
L_spot_hemi = (0.8 * T_eff^4 + 0.2 * T_spot^4) * sigma * Area_hemisphere.

The area_hemi is 2 pi R^2. Similarly, L_unspotted_hemi = sigma * T_eff^4 * 2 pi R^2.

Therefore, when the hemisphere fully unspotted is visible, the star's flux is L_unspotted_hemi / (4 pi d^2) = sigma T_eff^4 * 2 pi R^2 / (4 pi d^2) = sigma T_eff^4 (R^2 / (2 d^2)).

When the other hemisphere containing spots is facing us, it's L_spot_hemi / (4 pi d^2) = sigma (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) * 2 pi R^2 / (4 pi d^2) = sigma (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) * R^2 / (2 d^2).

So, delta_flux = (F_unspotted - F_spot) = sigma R^2 / (2 d^2) [ T_eff^4 - (0.8 T_eff^4 + 0.2 T_spot^4) ] = sigma R^2 / (2 d^2 ) * 0.2 (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ).

Then, the amplitude of variation (peak to trough) is (F_unspotted - F_spot) relative to F_avg. Because in observing brightness, star's apparent brightness oscillates between F_unspotted and F_spot.

Though most literature measures amplitude as the difference over the average flux?

Then, to get the amplitude similar to an exoplanet transit depth. For transits, depth is (Rp/R*)^2, because the planet covers a disk of area pi R_p^2 over the star’s disk area pi R*^2.

Therefore, if spot-induced amplitude delta_flux / F_avg is similar to (Rp/R*)^2:

A_spot = delta_flux / F_avg = [F_unspotted - F_spot] / F_avg.

We need to compute F_avg, for varying flux due to spots:

Since over the rotation period, the star spends 50% of the time in F_unspotted and 50% in F_spot.

F_avg = (F_unspotted + F_spot)/2.

Hence,

A_spot = (F_unspotted - F_spot) / (F_avg)

= (F_unspotted - F_spot) / [(F_unspotted + F_spot)/2] = 2 (F_unspotted - F_spot)/(F_unspotted + F_spot).

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude refers to the depth seen when the spots are in view, which would be delta_flux / F_unspotted. That is, how much the flux drops when the spots come into view, relative to the unspotted maximum.

If done this way, then the fractional decrease is (F_unspotted - F_spot) / F_unspotted = delta_flux / F_unspotted.

Similarly, a planet's transit height amplitude is (Rp/R*)^2. So maybe equate those?

You need to figure which measure of amplitude they are referring to. The question says "the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve", so amplitude as in peak-to-trough variation? Alternatively, depth when the spotted hemisphere is facing.

In standard light curves for spots: when the spots are on the side facing us, brightness decreases, when they pass to the other side, brightness is normal. So the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spot)/F_unspotted = 1 - (F_spot/F_unspotted). For exoplanet, it's 1 - (1 - (Rp/R*)^2) = (Rp/R*)^2.

But wait: Wait, actually planets TRANSIT in front, meaning they block some light. So if the planet's area is (Rp/R*)^2, the flux during transit is F = F_star * (1 - (Rp/R*)^2).

Therefore, the depth is (Rp/R*)^2. So during transit, depth is (Rp/R*)^2. So if the spot causes a depth of (F_max - F_min)/F_max = (F_unspotted - F_spot)/F_unspotted. So that is:
[ (sigma Teff^4 * Area_hemi / (4 pi d^2)) - (sigma (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 Tspot^4) * Area_hemi / (4 pi d^2)) ] / (sigma Teff^4 * Area_hemi / (4 pi d^2)).

The Area_hemi / (4 pi d^2) and sigma cancels.

So:

[ Teff^4 - (0.8 Teff^4 + 0.2 Tspot^4) ] / Teff^4 = [0.2 Teff^4 - 0.2 Tspot^4]/ Teff^4 = 0.2 * (1 - (Tspot/Teff)^4 )

Therefore, spot depth would be 0.2*(1 - (5000/6000)^4).

Compute that first:

5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈0.83333, so (5/6)^4 ≈ (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.

Therefore, the spot depth is 0.2*(1 - 0.48225) = 0.2*0.51775≈0.10355. So about 10.35% relative depth.

Therefore, equivalently, a planet with depth (Rp/R*)^2=0.10355, so Rp/R*≈√0.10355≈0.3218. So, roughly 32% of the star's radius.

But before we proceed, check all the steps again.

First, the spotted hemisphere:

Fractional coverage of spots per hemisphere is 20%, so their area is 0.2*(2πR²) = 0.4πR². Then compare to the total hemisphere area, which is 2πR². So in terms of flux contribution, when the spotted hemisphere is facing:

Each unspotted part of that hemisphere (80%) emits as 6000K, 20% spots emit as 5000K.

Then the flux contributions, since flux from a surface element on a star we receive is proportional to the surface area times T^4. Ignore limb darkening since presumably the problem expects to assume uniform brightness except for spots.

Thus, for the spotted hemisphere:

Flux_spotted_hemisphere = [ (0.8 * T_eff^4 ) + (0.2 * T_spot^4 ) ] * (Area_hemisphere)

Flux unspotted_hemisphere is just T_eff^4 * Area_hemisphere.

Flux from each hemisphere would then be (using R_sun's, etc., but since we ratio against each other, factors cancel. So:

Difference in flux between facing the unspotted hemisphere vs the spotted one is when comparing the flux.

But stars in reality don't go dark on the far side. Wait hold on. Wait, in actuality, the star's total flux (when observed from afar) integrates over the entire surface. However, when the spot is on the visible hemisphere, part of the surface is cooler. However, when the spot is on the far side, you don't see them. Hence, in reality, the brightness variation is due to the fraction of each hemisphere spotted over the rotation period.

Hmm. Wait, the confusion arises from this. Wait, actually, the star emits light in all directions. It's considered periodically varying as a result of rotation, meaning we cannot directly observe the far side but whether or not the spots affect the overall emissions. Wait, no—this seems confused.

Wait, another approach. For rotational modulation. When a star has a spot group, as it rotates, we see more or fewer spots in our view, changing the brightness. If spots are on only half the star (one hemisphere), then when that hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots (which are darker) and when it rotates away, we see the clean hemisphere.

But total flux received from the star would vary as that hemisphere faces towards us.

But in that sense: stars' light as integrated over the entire surface would only depend on the area visible, but in this case, star is considered to be such that we see it as a point source. So as it rotates, we can't resolve different parts, but changes in actual flux based on how much of its surface is spotted. This seems non-Roche lobe, but if a star rotates with a darker spot region (half) that when visible, reduces the flux. However, in standard models, the brightness variation depends on how much the spotted area affects the overall flux whenever it's visible.

But with a single hemisphere spotted, when that side is facing towards us, part is dark. When it's not, the bright side faces us, so maximum flux. The *projected area* over the visible hemisphere affects the total flux, but since when spots are on the far side, they don't subtract from the flux. So when a star is spotted on one hemisphere, as it rotates, when the spots rotate into the viewing field, we lose flux, and when rotated out again, we gain it.

But in reality, even standard calculations suggest there is fractional variation given the fill factor? Wait. Let's refer back to standard work here.

Actually, the spottedness effect on flux A(t) is:

A(t) = (Total Emission from visible hemisphere with spots)/(Total Emission from full hemisphere without spots).

Assuming the spots are on the visible hemisphere and their contribution (or in this case the lower contribution) based on where they’re located on the sphere. However, in our scenario, when one hemisphere is 20% covered, the effective emission when that hemisphere faces us is (1 - f)*T_eff^4 + f*T_spot^4 multiplied by the area of the hemisphere?

Alternatively, since in point source observations, the discussion of fill factors relates to projection.

A better way is to model it as, assuming the hemispheric spot group, of area covering 20% of that hemisphere.

When the hemisphere is facing us, the projected area for the star is a circle. The spots. 20% of the hemisphere. So, the spots occupy a region which is, when projected in our line of sight, also that 20% as a circular region.

But considering projection effects, 20% of a hemisphere's area is 0.2 * 2πR^2. The projected area we see if it's not uniformly spread. Wait, actually, for flux– which is position-dependent (limb darkening is a missing factor somewhere here), but maybe again the problem is approximating. If all spots are spread equally over the hemisphere, their projected area when viewed face-on is (maybe 0.2 * πR²). That is, if they are on a hemisphere (half the surface area), but when projected onto the visible disk, at the center. So total projected area of spots when the hemisphere is visible is 0.2 * (the area of the hemisphere we're looking at). Hemisphere's area is 2πR^2. The greatest circle we see is πR^2, hence 0.2 * πR^2 (assuming spots centered on the projected disk). Hmm.

But in any case, I think the problem wants us to think in terms of the loss of flux due to 20% of a hemisphere emitting less. Maybe we don't need to be accurate in terms of projection effects and just compute that 20% of the radiant flux from that hemisphere is cooler. Since flux is quantized per unit surface area. So spots and their filling factor effect.

Alternatively, since varying with the star’s rotation, the problem can be simplified with the assumption that one hemisphere is 20% spotted (T-T 1000K cool) and the other is unspotted. Therefore, when the spotted hem is visible, the star is not quite as bright as when it's hidden.

Therefore, the emission difference occurs between maximum (unspotted) and minimum (spotted hemisphere) flux. So:

L_max = sigma * T_eff^4 * (0.5 * A_total) + sigma * (0.5 * A_total) =

Wait, the star is half-spotted (no, spot covers 20% of one hem). Wait. No, spot covers 20% of one hemisphere. So:

*Total emitting area:

Unspotted hemisphere: 0.5 * A_total (if entire hemisphere was unspotted, it's 2πR², but with:

Wait, given A_total equal to 4πR².

But to calculate flux when a certain hemisphere is visible:

But stars are three-dimensional, so even if spots are distributed over a hemisphere, when facing toward us, we see a full disk, and the same when facing away. But spots on the other hemisphere would contribute unless they are dark.

But with the given modeling: when the "spotted" hemisphere is facing us, part of its light is blocked (20% are cooler spots). When the other (unspotted) hemisphere faces us, we receive full emission. Assuming we can't see the far hemisphere's spots since they are on the back (spherical nature should make some of them hidden or partially visible depending on projection, but assuming they are entirely hidden or not). However, with one full hemisphere (ocurring 50% of the star's surface) having its spots only on the front.

It gets confusing here, perhaps better to ignore geometry and focus on filling factor.

Alternatively, considering a simplified model where when spots are on the visible hemisphere (which is 50% of the time), then the effective blocked flux is the brightness drop from:

Total flux in unspotted state: L = 4πR²σT_eff^4.

Actually, when you have stars, their total luminosity is 4πR²σT_eff^4. But if a fraction, x, of the surface has temp T_spot, then:

L = (1 - x)4πR²σT_eff^4 + x4πR²σT_spot^4.

But in this case, since only 10% (since 20% of one hem) of the surface is spotted:

Wait, problem is so crucial here.

If only 20% of one hemisphere is spotted: one hemisphere is 2πR² (since surface area is 4πR²). Spots are on 20% of that, spot area 0.2*2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spotted area is 0.4πR²; of the entire surface (4πR²), that's 10% covered.

Therefore, x under total surface is 0.1. So, T=6000K of 90% of surface, and 10% at 5000K. So Total L = (0.9 * T_eff^4 + 0.1 T_spot^4 ) * 4πR²σ.

However, luminosity is not variable if the star is static. But in the problem statement, there is periodic variation due to *rotational* modulation—changes in the *observed* flux. So why is that?

Because when the spots are not front-and-center, we can see them, but they modify the light via lower emission by being in the hemisphere. But actually, we see the star's entire surface over time. Actually, it's tricky. Unless latitude-based. Perhaps the spot is co-rotating such that sometimes they face towards us (when on the facing hemisphere;when rotating periodically. Then, but more realistically, star is rotating with some inclination, track spots rotating into and out of view, inducing brightness variations. So the flux goes down by the spots' area times delta T, depending on how much of the hemisphere we see (projection).

But perhaps the problem simplifies, assuming means that when spots are visible vs. not. I think the problem might need simplified assumptions. Confusion again arises here.

But to move forward, suppose that:

The key formula when talking about spots leading to variability is delta L / L = ( L_max - L_min ) / L_average. So (Same formula as maximum variation relative to the average luminosity.

But due to spots: if the star's unspotted hemisphere's flux is L1, and spotted hemisphere's flux is L2. Since each hemisphere is observed half the time, the average is (L1 + L2)/2. The peak-to-peak variation is L1 - L2.

Formula for delta L / L which would be (L1 - L2)/average = (L1 - L2)/[(L1 + L2)/2] = 2(L1 - L2)/(L1 + L2). The flux difference.

But relative to when doing a similar transit; which depth is (Rp/R*)^2. The question is what exoplanet to cause same flux change with delta L / L.

Thus, 2(L1 - L2)/(L1 + L2) should be calculated and set equal to (R_p / R*)^2.

First, compute L1 and L2.

Given:

- The unspotted hemisphere (Hem1) facing in L1.

But each hemisphere is 2πR². But flux is integrated over entire visible disk, which for a centered hemisphere would be predominantly where we’re facing. But given the star being a sphere, the total flux emitted is the same all the time (it's finite). Wait! That can't be. How?

Wait a critical confusion: all points on a star contribute to the luminosity. Spots (whether facing the observer or not) contribute less as Teff, waiting, but luminosity is integrated over all directions. But star’s total luminosity (intrinsic brightness) would not depend on the orientation (But if axisymmetric spots don't affect the total). If they’re localized, different? Even more confusing.

Wait, but in practice, if a part of the star's surface is spotted with lower temperature, then if these spots are facing towards us, another hemisphere. When spotted hemisphere is towards us, you "observe" lower flux. Stellar luminosity is 4πR²sigma(Teff^4)*(1 - x) over by x coming from spots. Wait, but the star's total luminosity is actually fixed. Unless there are spots—no, wait. The star as an emitter converts some arrangement of spotted regions, meaning lower emission globally? But that only holds if spots change total radiation. But spotted regions are cooler, thus less effective emitting but have long-term lowering.

Wait the star's total luminosity with spots must account for the entire surface.

But given spots have lower temps, so integrating over entire star (who is uniformly rotating with spots in one hemishphere). But stellar irradiation viewed from Earth would vary as the spot-filled hemisphere contributes when turned towards us.

So there, we view part of the spotted spectrum versus normal.

So basically, when the star spot has one hemisphere mottled with spots, when we observe that hemisphere, we get a different flux than when it's facing the other way. Therefore, our flux (apparent) seems modulated.

But to model the max to min luminosity difference in time-series for an unresolved star. So to an observer away from the star, the flux would be L = Integral over visible disk (sigma T^4 dA cos(theta)/pi) ? Wait, integrated over visible hemisphere plus considering brightness distribution as per limb darkening, but this is more complixated and the problem expects simplistic calculation. Let me refer to repeated considerations.

If we parameterize the stellar flux observed from Earth as F when the spotted hemisphere is facing us:

F_spot = (T_eff^4 * (1 - f) + T_spot^4 * f) * (Area facing us) * sigma / (4 pi d^2); ignoring exact geometrical view.

But simplistically, the star's apparent flux is proportional to brightness (T^4) times the visible (projected) area.

But the area facing us is its apparent disk, πR². The question is if the entire disk is represented, but with various spots to block the flux.

But we must take into account how much of the disk is spotted when different hemisphere faces us. But here the complicacy arises. To have a reasonable approach, perhaps we model the original problem as follows.

The star with radius R has one hemisphere (50% of surface area) spotted with filling factor 20%, which is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So 10% of the entire star's surface is spotted.

But when observing the star, how much of those spots are actually visible on the disk?

Wait when the spotted hemisphere turns toward us, the proportion might differ.

Alternatively, perhaps ideas introduced in textbook examples:

The textbook case: light variation of a star rotating with a single, circular spot. The time-dependent flux thereby depends on longitude of the spot. Ignoring inclinations and latitudes, if the spot is on the equator and star's spinning edge-on, we'd see the spot completely obscuring part of the star's disk as it moves face-on, leading to flux proportional to relative areas, minimally when the spot is centered. So maximum drop-off.

But our case here is one hemisphere has 20% filled with spots. Not a single spot, but distributed covering 20% of that petal. Hmm.

Alternatively, though, perhaps integrating spatially – the filling factor on the hemisphere. The problem states that dark spots have a filling factor of 20% over one hemisphere.

Envision hemisphere has 20% spots, so that when facing toward us, 20% of the observed disk is covered with spots. I think area-wise: if the hemisphere's total area is 2πR², as seen by an external observer when translating to a projection. That is, the disk's projection area is πR². Therefore, 20% of the half hemisphere's surface area might convert to perhaps 10% disk coverage (since projected).

But this becomes complex in converting area to flat projection. Instead, ignoring projection effects, if we consider that when the hemisphere is oriented toward Earth, 20% of that hemisphere's surface is covered with spots, whose flux is 5000K instead of 6000K.

So the observed flux would be, in the case of spotted hemisphere being towards us:

F_spot = sigma * T_eff^4 * (area of hemisphere * (1 - f_spot)) + sigma * T_spot^4 * (area of hemisphere * f_spot)} / (4 pi d²). But aquestàrying why divided by 4 pi d square? Because each point on the star emits radiation into 4 pi, we observe only that portion? Wait flux is σT^4 per unit area. Total flux from the hemisphere would be ∑ all elements sigma T^4 dA divided into 4pi since each surface element emits in all 4pi steradians.

Alternatively, observers receive flux from the hemisphere visible towards us (to each hemisphere phase). Confusion steps underscoring unfamiliarity. Maybe surface brightness is sigma*T^4/pi for limb darkening but simplified to sigma*T^4 else.

Alternatively, we main whiteboard summarize:

F_instantanous = (Normal flux * (1 - fractional_area_spots) * (T_eff)^{4} + fractional_area_spots * T_spot^4) relative.

But given the goal of creating an equivalent to transit depth. So let's say maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is towards us.

While minimum flux when the spotted hemisphere is towards us. Flux difference is delta_F = F_max - F_min. As the star rotates. In exoplanet's transit case, delta_F = F_disk = (Rp / R*)^2 * F_star.

Set F_max - F_min = delta_F = (Rp/R*)^2 * F_max. Or photometric depth, transit as a fractional dip.

So proceed to compute these.

First, let's find F_max = F_unspotted. This is when the spotted hemisphere is facing away.

F_unspotted is the flux from half the star's surface (unspotted hemisphere) and the other hemisphere (spotted), but since the spots are facing away from us: so contribution of T_spot is zero? Because they are on the hemisphere facing away. Hence:

F_unspotted = (Emissivity of unspotted hemisphere) + (Emissivity of spotted hemisphere[[[BUT T_spot is less]]] — but is the far hemisphere contributing as darks too; but naively, if you cannot see their spots, their regular emission.)

Wait, total flux is that 4 pi R² sigma T_eff^4 —actual overall star's output. Confusing here. The observer can see surface brightness of various star elements. The problem arises when spots are pervading different longitudinal areas but hidden when viewed from Earth.

But in reality, when spots are on the hemisphere away from Earth, their radiation is not directed toward us. Wait, but stars' radiation emits in all directions;*each surface element emits in all directions. Therefore, integrating over the entire surface when spotted on one hemisphere. However, for *apparent* flux verses star’s true luminosity. Semi-mixed.

Therefore to approximate apparent flux received by observers:

The observer sees (in a simplified case) half of the spots in the star: those facing us. That is, spots on the earth-facing hemisphere contribute to the observed flux.

The problem's systemic dificulty is defining exact equation for flux variation.

But why do stars with spots present variation in light curves if the spots are out of our view?

 No, possible si a star has spots distributed such that their affected region and the star's rotation causes us to see more or fewer spots.

But suppose the entire spotted area is on one hemisphere: so if spotted hemisphere turned towards us or not. If the star’s axis is aligned so that hemisphere be rotating in and out of view as of Earth’s perspective.

For example, if the star's rotational axis is perpendicular to our line of sight so that hemisphere stays visible as it rotates （ but fix a particular spotted hemisphere facing) hm.

 No. In reality, it depends on how the star’s rotation brought different hemispheres into view.

Assume the star always presents the same hemisphere (aligned like our tidally-locked with Earth perspective). Then the flux doesn’t vary. But if star's axis misaligned, and when of equatorial viewing, we see spots come into view as it rotates.

But inany case，if spots cover 20% of a hemisphere, when projected, at what fraction does that cover? A bit tricky.

Given confusion and time limitations imposed by natural brain speed, need to move but recalling the parameter mentioned: the answer might be 0.3-something.

But step succinctly.

Method:

- Find flux dip when spotted hemisphere is facing us. DeltaF = F_unspotted - F_spotted.

DeltaF / F_unspotted ~ (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Compute deltaF is due to the fraction of hemisphere covered with spots, as function of temperature effect. So:

F_spotted = F_unspotted * [0.8 + 0.2*(Tspot / Teff)^4 ]

Thus:

DeltaF = F_un - F_spotted = F_un (1 - [0.8+0.2*(Tspot/Teff)^4 ]) = F_un * 0.2 (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

As before. So:

(DeltaF / F_un) = 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈0.1035….

Set this equal to (R_p/Rs)^2, then solve:

Rp/Rs= sqrt(0.10355)= approx 0.322, so about 32% radius of the star. Or roughly half of Jupiter to the Sun (Sun radius 7e5 km, Jupiter 7e4 km— ~0.1, but bigger than Earth). But here, hypothetical planet would be 0.32 times.

But the premise sets the amplitude of brightness variation due to spot modulation corresponds to an exoplanet transit. Hence the answer is approx 0.32 Rstar. So, approximately Rp/Rs=0.32. Compute accurately the real value:

5000 / 6000=5/6, so (5/6)^4=625/1296≈0.482253

Therefore，1 - 0.482253=0.517747

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2*0.517747≈0.10355

Square root? 0.10355<> about a bit less than 0.32 calculate sqrt(0.10355) as exactly:

0.32²=0.1024. Hence, sqrt is between 0.32 (0.1024) and 0.3219 (0.10355). Compute precise:

Assume a^2=0.10355, solve a: so, 0.32 error to 0.32:

0.32^2 = 0.1024. 0.10355 -0.1024= 0.00115.

Each approximate 0.0001 for a small delta.

Approximate, (a + dx)^2= a² + 2a dx + dx²≈ a² + 2a dx.

We want a=0.32, a²=0.1024. To reach 0.10355,  difference is 0.00115.

Then 2a dx≈0.00115 → dx≈0.00115 / (2*0.32)=0.00115 / 0.64≈0.001796

Thus, a≈0.32 +0.001796≈0.3218. So, appr 0.3218. So R_planet =~ 0.32Rs.

Hence, in boxed notation, \boxed{0.32}. But more precisely:

Given we need to compute with more exact figures.

First, more accurately calculate (5000/6000)^4:

(5/6)^4= (0.83333…)^4=0.83333^2 *0.83333^2= 0.6944444..*0.694444..= (5000)^4/(6000)^4. Now, 0.694444444 squared: taking; first, first roughly howAnd certain to calculation:

0.694444444 × 0.694444444:

Multiply precise:

0.694444444 ×0.694444:

Hahl .

694,444,444 * 694,444,444. This will lead to decimal appoximation as above. Alternatively, note:

（5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4)=625/1296. Divide 625 by 1296. Compute 625 / 1296:

1296 ÷ 625≈2.0736, so reciprocal≈0.482253....

Therefore, calculate 1 -625/1296= (1296-625)/1296=671/1296≈671/1296≈ divide numerator & denominator by approximations:

1296/16=81, so 1296=81*16. 671 divided by 81≈8.283… 671 divided by 16=41.9375 So, no reciprocal. necessarily，different.

671 / 1296≈0.517747。 Similarly。

Then, 0.2 * 0.517747= 0.10355, so delta_F /F_un =0.10355.

Therefore, to get to R,_earthward.sqrt(0.10355)=.

Calculating:

0.32^2=0.1024.

0.322^2=0.103684 (wait 322^2 =.

32^2= 1024, 322^2= 322*322= (320 +2)^2= 320²+4*320 +4=102400 +1280 +4=103,684. Therefore, 0.322²=0.322 *0.322:

0.3*0.3=0.09, 0.3*0.02=0.006,  0.02*0.3=0.006. 0.02*.02=0.0004.
Plus two times 0.3*0.02: sum all.

Alternatively, use (0.32 +0.002)squared:

=0.32² +2*0.32*0.002 +0.002²=0.1024 +0.00128 +0.000004=approx0.103684.

So，=0.3225. 0.322^2=0.103684.

But we need sqrt(0.10355). Now, 0.10355 is halfway between 0.103684 and 0.1024. Therefore, linear interpolation.

0.10368 minus 0.10355=0.00013, offset from upper bound.

Total upper reduction to reach it is steps between x=0.322 which is 0.103684, and x=0.321 gives (0.321)^2=0.321*0.321=0.103041.

Wait，the problem:

a= sqrt(0.10355)=approximately==?

Compute:

Start with x0=0.3218. Approach f(x)=0.

f(0.3218)=0.3218²=5.310² ? No: 0.3218*0.3218:

Calculate 0.3*0.3=0.09 ,  0.0218²≈ 0.0218*0.0218≈0.000475

And midterms: 2*a*b=2 *0.3 *0.0218=0.01308 ; So total 0.09 +0.01308 +0.000475≈0.10355. Exactly. Therefore, np.

Which worked out earlier:

As 0.09 + 2*(0.006 + 0.00054 + 0.000036)=0.09 +2*(0.006576)=0.09 +0.013152=0.103152 plus 0.02² 0.0004 and 0.0018² ≈0.00000324. Hmm，no，different expansion. Perhaps better compute decimals:

Multiply 0.3218*0.02=0.006436。

Multiply 0.3218*0.3=0.09654.

Adding together:

+0.0003218

总结这些：

0.09654 + 0.006436 =0.102976

+0.0003218=0.1032978

+0.00025744=0.10355524。

So, 0.3218*0.3218≈0.10355524，需要一直反覆弄得。

Given that 0.3218 ^ 2≈0.103555 which is precisely ~0.10355 as desired‖Therefore, x=0.3218 makes x²=0.10355, approximaris that the sqrt(0.10355)=0.3218; so R_p= ~0.32 Rstar。

Therefore, the answer is approximate 0.32, more exactly≈0.322.

Seconds glance the problem is deep trouble describing, yet likely accepting 0.32 as the answer.

Alternatively, ruling gets trouble. Thus (Rpl/Rstar)^2=0.2*(1 - (5000/6000)^4) →0.2*(1 -0.482253)=0.10355→ Rpl/Rstar≈sqrt(0.10355)= 0.3218≈0.32.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star should be \boxed{0.32}.
