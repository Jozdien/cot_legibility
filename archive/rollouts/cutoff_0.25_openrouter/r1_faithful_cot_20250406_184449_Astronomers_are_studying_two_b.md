# Original Question

Astronomers are studying two binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.

To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the given radial velocity amplitudes and orbital periods for both systems. The key steps involve applying Kepler's laws and the relationship between radial velocities and masses.

1. **Radial Velocity Amplitudes and Mass Ratios**:
   - For system_1, the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. The mass ratio of the two stars is given by \( \frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \). Thus, the total mass of system_1 is \( M_1 + M_2 = M_1 + 2M_1 = 3M_1 \).
   - For system_2, the radial velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The mass ratio of the two stars is \( \frac{M_2}{M_1} = \frac{15}{10} = 1.5 \). Thus, the total mass of system_2 is \( M_1 + M_2 = M_1 + 1.5M_1 = 2.5M_1 \).

2. **Kepler's Third Law and Total Mass**:
   - The total mass of a binary system can be calculated using the formula derived from Kepler's third law and radial velocity amplitudes:
     \[
     M_{\text{total}} = \frac{(K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P}{2 \pi G}
     \]
   where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the radial velocity amplitudes, \( P \) is the orbital period, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant.

3. **Mass Ratio Calculation**:
   - For system_1: \( K_1 + K_2 = 15 \) km/s and \( P = 2 \) years.
   - For system_2: \( K_1 + K_2 = 25 \) km/s and \( P = 1 \) year.
   - The ratio of the total masses of system_1 and system_2 is:
     \[
     \frac{M_{\text{total}_1}}{M_{\text{total}_2}} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} = \frac{54}{125}
     \]

Thus, the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is \(\boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The question mentions binary star systems with eclipses and radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. Hmm, I remember that in binary stars, the period is related to the orbital parameters, and the radial velocities can give information about the masses. Wait, Kepler's laws might come into play here. 

First, let's recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars in a binary system are related to their masses. If we have two stars, star A and star B, their velocity amplitudes, let's call them K_A and K_B, should satisfy the relation K_A / K_B = M_B / M_A. Because the more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude, right? Since the center of mass is closer to the more massive star, so it moves less. So the ratio of velocities is inverse to the ratio of their masses.

So in system_1, we have K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s. Wait, wait, but which star is which? Let me check the problem statement again. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. Similarly, system_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. 

So for system_1, star 1 has velocity amplitude 10, star 2 has 5. Then, the mass ratio would be M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. So M2 = 2 M1. Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1. Wait, so total mass is 3 M1, but we don't know M1 or M2 individually. Similarly for system_2, their amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s, so M2_system2 / M1_system2 = K1_system2 / K2_system2 = 15/10 = 1.5. So M2 = 1.5 M1, total mass is 2.5 M1_system2.

But how do we relate the total masses between the two systems? We need another equation. Kepler's third law comes to mind. The period and the semi-major axis are related to the total mass. Kepler's third law states that (P/(2π))² = a³/(G(M1 + M2)). But we need to connect this with the radial velocities. 

Wait, for a binary system, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M sin i)/( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * 1/( (1 + q) P^(1/3) )) ), but I'm not sure if that's the exact formula. Maybe I should think more carefully. 

Alternatively, using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) a³. Here, a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. For a circular orbit, the orbital speed v is related to the semi-major axis and the period by v = 2πa/P. But since it's a two-body problem, each star is orbiting the center of mass. So the semi-major axis of each star's orbit around the center of mass, a1 and a2, should satisfy a1 + a2 = a (the total semi-major axis between the two stars). Also, M1 a1 = M2 a2. 

The velocities of the two stars would be v1 = 2πa1/P and v2 = 2πa2/P. So the ratio v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. Which confirms that the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

Therefore, in system_1: K1 = 10, K2 =5, so M2/M1 = 10/5 = 2 ⇒ M2 = 2 M1. Hence total mass of system_1 is 3 M1. 

Similarly, system_2: K1 =15, K2 =10 ⇒ M2/M1 = 15/10 = 1.5 ⇒ M2 = 1.5 M1 ⇒ total mass = 2.5 M1, where M1 is the mass of the smaller star in system_2.

But how do we relate the M1 of system_1 and M1 of system_2? Are there more equations here? Because we know the period as well, so maybe we can combine that.

Wait, Kepler's third law involves the total mass and the period. So perhaps use the RV amplitudes along with the period to find the total mass.

The formula that comes to mind is the mass function, which for a spectroscopic binary can be written in terms of the radial velocity amplitude and the period. However, the mass function requires the inclination angle i of the orbit. Since the problem mentions that the systems exhibit eclipses, that implies that the inclination is close to 90 degrees (edge-on). So sin i is approximately 1. That might allow us to use the formula assuming sin i ≈ 1.

Therefore, the mass function for each star is given by:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2π G) * (1/(1 + q)^2)

But wait, perhaps a better approach. Since both stars are observed through their radial velocities, perhaps we can express the total mass using both velocity amplitudes. Let me recall the relation:

For a binary system, the total mass M = M1 + M2. The velocity amplitudes are such that K1 = (2π a1)/P and K2 = (2π a2)/P, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of the orbits of the two stars around the center of mass. And we also know that a1 + a2 = a (the separation), and from the center of mass condition: M1 a1 = M2 a2. So M1/M2 = a2/a1. Let's note that K1/K2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. 

So combining all that with Kepler's law: P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³

But a = a1 + a2 = a1 (1 + a2/a1) = a1 (1 + M1/M2) = (a1)(M2 + M1)/M2) = (a1 M_total)/M2). Similarly, a = a1 + a2, but it's better to relate a in terms of a1 or a2.

Alternatively, since K1 = 2π a1/P, so a1 = K1 P/(2π). Similarly a2 = K2 P/(2π). Therefore, a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) P/(2π)

Then, substitute a into Kepler's law:

P² = (4π²/[G(M1 + M2)]) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P/(2π) )³ ]

Let me write this:

Left side: P²

Right side: (4π²/(G M_total)) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2π) )³ ]

So:

P² = (4π² / (G M_total)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2π)^3 ) )

Multiply stuff:

Left = P²

Right = (4π² / (G M_total)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 ) ) )

Simplify numerator denominators:

4π² divided by 8 π³ is (4 /8) * (π² / π³ ) = (1/2) * (1/π )

So:

Right = (1/(2 π G M_total)) * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) 

Set equal to left:

P² = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (2 π G M_total )

Multiply both sides by (2 π G M_total ):

2 π G M_total P² = (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 

Divide both sides by P²:

2 π G M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P 

Then solve for M_total:

M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G )

Wait, but check dimensions here. Let me see: K is in km/s, P is in years.

But G is in standard units, so better convert the terms. But since we are taking ratios between system_1 and system_2, maybe the units would cancel. Let's see.

But the problem is asking for the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, compute M_total1 / M_total2.

Using the formula above:

M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G )

Therefore, the ratio would be:

M_total1 / M_total2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 / (2 π G ) ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 / (2 π G ) ] = ( (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ) / ( (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 )

Yes, the constants cancel. So, I just need to compute that ratio.

For system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So K1_1 =10, K2_1=5. Therefore, K1 + K2 for system_1 = 15 km/s. The period P1 is 2 years.

For system_2, the velocities are 15 and10 km/s. K1_2=15, K2_2=10, so K1 + K2 is 25 km/s. Period P2 is 1 year.

Thus, the ratio of the total masses is:

[(15)^3 * 2 ] / [ (25)^3 * 1 ] = (3375 * 2 ) / (15625) = 6750 / 15625

Calculate that: 6750 divided by 15625.

Let me compute: 15625/6750. Well, simplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 25:

6750 / 25 = 270; 15625 /25 = 625.

So 270/625. Wait, but wait, original ratio was 6750/15625. 6750 ÷ 25 = 270; 15625 ÷25 = 625; so 270/625 can be divided by 5 again: 270 ÷5=54, 625 ÷5=125. 54/125 ≈ 0.432. But since it's M_total1 / M_total2, so system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, which would mean system_2 is more massive. Wait, but the question says "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So according to this, the factor would be ~0.432, meaning system_1 is less massive. But that can't be right. I must have messed up.

Wait wait, the formula I derived was M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G )

So to find M_total1 / M_total2, it's [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

For the numbers:

- System1: K_total = 15, P=2

- System2: K_total =25, P=1

So plug into ratio:

(15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1) = (3375 *2)/15625=6750/15625=0.432. Therefore, system1 is 0.432 times as massive as system2. Therefore, system2 is more massive by a factor of 1/0.432 ≈2.315.

But the question is by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. If it's 0.432 times, then system_1 is less massive.

But the question says "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the answer is less than 1, that would mean system_2 is more massive. But perhaps I messed up the ratio. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, in drawing from Kepler's law: P² = 4π² a³/(G(M1 + M2))

But in terms of the velocity amplitude, since each star's velocity is K = 2π a1/P (where a1 is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the COM). Then, since a = a1 + a2 = a1 (1 + q), where q = M1/M2. Wait, but since K1/K2 = M2/M1, so if M1 = q M2, then K1 = K2 (1/q).

Wait, let's re-examine the entire derivation.

For a binary system:

- The two stars orbit the center of mass.

- The semi-major axes of their orbits are a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 = a (the separation between the stars).

- The center of mass requires that M1 a1 = M2 a2.

- Thus, M1/M2 = a2/a1 = q, where q is the mass ratio.

- The orbital period P is the same for both stars.

- The velocity amplitudes are K1 = 2π a1 / P and K2 = 2π a2 / P.

- Hence, K1/K2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1.

From Kepler's Third Law:

P² = (4π² / G(M1 + M2)) * a³.

Express a in terms of the velocities:

a = a1 + a2 = (K1 P / 2π) + (K2 P / 2π) = (K1 + K2) P / 2π.

So substituting into Kepler's equation:

P² = (4π² / G(M1 + M2)) * [( (K1 + K2) P / 2π )³ ]

Simplifying:

P² = (4π² / G(M1 + M2)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³ ) )

P² = (4π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³ G(M1 + M2))

Simplify the coefficients:

4 / 8 = 0.5, π² / π³ = 1/π. So:

P² = (0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (π G(M1 + M2))

Multiply both sides by π G(M1 + M2):

π G(M1 + M2) P² = 0.5(K1 + K2)^3 P^3

Divide both sides by P²:

π G(M1 + M2) = 0.5(K1 + K2)^3 P

Therefore:

M1 + M2 = (0.5 (K1 + K2)^3 P) / (π G )

But since 0.5 / π is 1/(2π), so M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 π G )

Which is what I had before. So indeed, the total mass depends on (K_total)^3 * P / constant. So the ratio would be [(K1+K2)^3 * P ] / [(K1'+ K2')^3 * P'].

For our two systems, plugging in:

System1: K1=10, K2=5: K_total=15, P=2

System2: K1=15, K2=10: K_total=25, P=1

So system1 mass is proportional to 15³ * 2 = 3375*2=6750

System2 mass is proportional to 25³ *1 =15625

Thus, the ratio is system1/system2 =6750 /15625=0.432, which is approx 27/64?

Wait, wait 25³ is 15625; 15³ is 3375. Yes. 3375*2=6750. 6750/15625.

Let's divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750 ÷25=270, 15625 ÷25=625.

Then, 270/625. Let me see, 270 and 625 can be divided by 5:270÷5=54, 625÷5=125. So 54/125. 54/125 = 0.432 Thus, 0.432: So yes, the ratio is 54/125. So system_1 is 54/125 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is more massive by 125/54 ≈2.3148 times. But the question asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" But according to this calculation, system_1 is less massive. 

So did I invert something? Is there a miscalculate? Let me double-check.

Let me write the equations clearer. The formula for total mass M is:

M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2πG)

But in reality, is that correct? Let's see, check the dimensions:

If K is km/s, P is in seconds, G is in m³/(kg s²)

So let's convert K to m/s: but since it's a ratio, maybe that's okay. Let me see:

Actually, the critical point is units for formula. The formula above is missing the scaling from units, which may be an oversight. However, if you use the formula without considering unit conversion factors, then units won’t match. That could be the problem here. Perhaps you need to use Kepler's formula in terms of days or AU? Let me remember.

Alternatively, maybe if RV is given in km/s, period in years, the formula needs a constant. 

The standard Kepler's third law in astronomical units is:

P² = (a³)/(M_total)

where P is in years, a in AU, and M_total in solar masses, assuming the correct scaling. But perhaps that's oversimplified.

Wait, the standard formula is P² = a³/(M_total), when P is in years, a in AU, and M_total in solar units. But that is a Henry Draper (or other) convention, and you might need to include gravitational constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression in terms of RV. 

Alternatively, using the formula for a binary system with both stars visible (double-lined spectroscopic binary):

The mass sum is given by:

M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( (2 π)^2 * G ) * sin³ i 

But again, since it's eclipsing, sin i ≈1.

But if all other parameters were in standard units (SI units), then the formula gives mass in kg. However, we are supposed to compute the ratio, so units would cancel as long as both systems are computed with the same units.

However, in our calculation above, even without considering unit conversions (assuming that P and K are expressed in consistent units with G in relevant units), when taking the ratio M1/M2, the unit conversion factor would cancel. Therefore the formula for the ratio should be as we have: 0.432.

Therefore, if system_1's total mass is 0.432 times system_2's total mass, then system_1 is less massive. So the answer would be 54/125, which is 0.432. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. If it's 0.432, meaning it's less. Which would imply the answer is the inverse, but that's only if my approach has my ratio inverted.

Wait, maybe I mix up the order.

Ah, wait, starting from M_total (system_1)/ M_total(system_2)= (15³ *2)/(25³ *1)= 3375*2/15625=0.432. Thus, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive. But the question says "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" Therefore if  system_1 is less massive, the answer would be 0.432 (system_1 is 0.432 times the mass of system_2) or inverse? Because "by what factor more massive" is ambiguous. If something is half as massive, it is 0.5 times, which is "less massive", but how you ask the question might need to take inverse. Wait, no. No, the "factor by which A is more massive than B" should mean A / B. So when you say "A is x times more massive than B", that means A = x * B. Therefore if the ratio A/B = 0.5, then A is 0.5 times as massive, i.e., half as massive. So in this case, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, so it's less. But the problem states "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" Which would be... then, maybe we did something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in physical assumptions. Since we know that the center of mass causes the velocity amplitudes to depend inversely on masses, so perhaps there's another way to find the mass of each system.

Alternatively, perhaps using the velocity amplitudes and the period, and Kepler's third law with the formula that includes semi-amplitude. Because let's recall that the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity for a star in a binary system is:

K = ( 2 π G )^(1/3) * ( M_star )^(2/3) / ( ( M_total )^(1/3) ( 1 + q ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( P^(1/3) ) )

But since systems are eclipsing, i ≈90°, sin i ≈1. Forgetting about sin i, and assuming it's 1.

Given that, for a star in system_1:

So for the first value, the amplitude K1=10 km/s for star 1 in system_1. The mass of the other star (star2) is M2. Let me recall that formula. Maybe:

The semi-amplitude K is related to M_comp, M_total, P,

Alternatively, we can use the formula (from Kepler's third law combined with Doppler shift method):

K = ( ( G (M_comp) sin i ) / (2 π (1 + q) ) )^(1/3) * (2 π / P )^(1/3 )

Wait, no, perhaps we can write the formula more properly:

From the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( G (M_c) sin i ) / ( (1 + q)^2 c^3 ) )^(1/3) * (2 π / P )^(1/3 )

But perhaps I need to revisit the proper formula. From the radial velocity equation:

For a binary system, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity for star 1 is:

K1 = ( ( 2 π G ) / (c^3 P ) )^(1/3) * ( M2 sin i ) / ( ( M1 + M2 )^(2/3 ) )

Or wait, check proper formula. According to the radial velocity method:

K = (v * sin i) = [ (G(M2)^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) * ( 1 / (1 + M1/M2 )^2 ) * ( 4 π² ) / P² ) ]^(1/3) (But maybe this is not correct.)

Alternatively, check the standard formula. Let me see.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude for star 1 in a spectroscopic binary is:
K1 = [ (2 π G ) / (c³ P ) ]^(1/3) * ( M2³ sin³ i ) / ( ( M1 + M2 )² )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me search for the correct formula.

The standard RV semi-amplitude for a star in a binary system is given by:

K = ( ( G (M_companion) ) / ( (1 + q)² c³ ) )^(1/3) * ( 2 π / P )^(1/3 )

where q is the mass ratio M_companion / M_star.

Alternatively, according to this source:

K = ( (G * P) / (2 π))^(-1/3) * ( M_comp sin i ) / ( (1 + q) )

Wait, perhaps:

The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = [ (G (M_companion) sin i ) / (2 π (1 + q) ) ]^(1/3) * (2 π / P )^(1/3 )

But honestly, I might need to go back to physical principles. The key point is that given the RVs for both stars, the ratio of their masses is known (ratio of velocity), and given Kepler's third law which relates period and total mass. Here’s another approach.

From the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2, we can get the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2. Let's say q1 is system_1's mass ratio and q2 system_2's.

Therefore, for system_1: q1 = 10/5 = 2. Hence, M1_sys1 = M1 and M2_sys1 =2 M1. So total mass_sys1 =3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2: q2=15/10=1.5. M1_sys2 =M1', M2_sys2 =1.5 M1', total mass_sys2 =2.5 M1'.

Now, Kepler's third law: P² = (4 π² / G(M1+M2)) * a³.

The separation a can be expressed in terms of the velocities and period. Each star's velocity is K = 2 π a_star / P, so the total semi-major axis of the binary system is a= a1 +a2= (K1 P / (2 π )) + ( K2 P / (2 π )) = (K1 + K2) P / (2 π ).

So a = (K1 + K2) P / (2 π )

Then, substituting back into Kepler's law:

P² = (4 π² / ( G M_total )) * [ (K1 + K2) P / (2 π ) ]³

Multiply both sides by G M_total:

G M_total P² = 4 π² [ (K1 + K2) P / 2 π ]³ / M_total

Wait, no:

Starting again:

P² = (4π² / G M_total ) a³

Replace a with (K1 + K2) P / (2 π ):

P² = (4 π² / G M_total ) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P ) / (2 π ) ]³

Expand the cube:

P² = (4 π² / G M_total ) * ( (K1 + K2)³ P³ ) / ( 8 π³ ) )

Simplify fractions:

4 π² divided by 8 π³ is (4/8)( π² / π³ ) = (1/2)(1 / π )

So:

P² = (1) / (2 π ) * ( (K1 + K2)³ P³ ) /  ( G M_total )

Then, multiply both sides by G M_total * 2 π : 

2 π G M_total P²= (K1 + K2 )³ P³

Divide both sides by P²:

2 π G M_total= (K1 + K2 )³ P

Solving for M_total:

M_total = (K1 + K2 )³ P / (2 π G )

Which is where we were before, with the same result. So as previous, given its ratio simplifies in a way the unit conversion coefficients cancel, then the mass ratios are:

System_1: M1 =3 M1*

System_2: M2=2.5 M1'

But without knowing the actual relations, the question is about the ratio of system_1 to system_2's masses. As per formula:

M_total1/M_total2= [ (K1_sys1 +K2_sys1 )^3 * P_sys1 ) / (K1_sys2 +K2_sys2 )^3 * P_sys2 ) ]

Despite earlier checks yielding system_1 as less massive, handling unit consistency.

But maybe missing a factor. For example, URK. Since the formula requires the velocities in m/s, period in seconds, but we are using km/s and years, possible need unit conversion. How about let's rederived with proper units.

Let me use SI units:

For Kepler's third law: P² = (4 π² G)⁻¹ (M_total )^(-1) a³ ?

Wait, no. Actually, the exact formula is P² = (4 π²/(G(M1 + M2))) a³. So:

Mass M_total in kg, a in meters, then the period in seconds. 

Let me elaborate:

Suppose system1:

Right compute system_1's total mass and system_2's total mass and then take the ratio.

Given periods in years, so need to convert to seconds:

1 year ≈ 31557600 seconds.

But, since the ratio cancels units of P,i think. Let's code lining:

M_total_system1 = ( (K1_sys1 +K2_sys1 )^3 * P_sys1 ) / (2 pi G )

Likewise for system_2. The problem is that radial velocities are given in km/s, but we need to convert them to m/s. Let's be precise.

For system_1:

K_total_sys1 = (10 +5) km/s=15 km/s = 15000 m/s.

P_sys1 = 2 years =2 *31557600 seconds ≈ 63115200 sec.

For system_1's mass:

M_total_sys1 = ( (15000 m/s )³ *63115200 s ) / ( 2 pi G )

For system_2:

K_total_sys2 =15+10=25 km/s=25000 m/s.

P_sys2=1 year=31557600 sec.

Mass_system2= (25000^3 *31557600 )/(2 pi G )

Then take the ratio:

Ratio= M_sys1 / M_sys2 = ( (15000^3*63115200) / (2 pi G ) ) / ( (25000^3*31557600)/(2 pi G ) )

Cancel 2 pi G: numerator & denominator:

= (15000³ *63115200 ) / (25000³ *31557600 )

Simplify integers:

Note that 63115200 /31557600= exactly 2.

So Ratio= (15000³ * 2 ) / (25000³ )

= ( (15/25)^3 ) * 2 ) = ( (3/5)^3 ) *2= (27/125)*2=54/125=0.432.

So same result.

Confirmed computationally.

Therefore, it stands that (if done accurately in SI units) the ratio is 54/125, meaning system_1 is a little less than half as massive as system_2. So "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" answer would be 54/125 ≈0.432. However, system_2 is more massive.

But that seems to contradict the question's standby, possibly due to which parameter's reciprocal.

Wait, reflecting on initial steps, original question mentions that the periods are 2 years and 1 year for system_1 and system_2. In the equations for mass vs RV amplitudes, a larger velocity summ and smaller period would bias the mass according to that formula.

System_2 has higher total velocities (25 vs 15) and shorter period (1 vs 2 years), contributing significantly to the cubed term (25/15~1.666, cubing to ~4.63), scaled by a shorter period. Indeed 25^3=15625; 15^3 *2= 3375*2=6750; 6750/15625=0.432.

Anyway, pulling all this together, we're told to compute the ratio and that makes system_1 0.432 times as massive. But as per question’s phrasing, they might want system2 is approximated 2.3148 times more massive than system1. But if answer is expected to be 27/64 or  54/125. Hmm. Wait the R is 54/125.

There's something here that doesn?

**Final Answer**
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is \boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's see. I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The question mentions binary star systems with eclipses and radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. Hmm, I remember that in binary stars, the period is related to the orbital parameters, and the radial velocities can give information about the masses. Wait, Kepler's laws might come into play here. 

First, let's recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for the two stars in a binary system are related to their masses. If we have two stars, star A and star B, their velocity amplitudes, let's call them K_A and K_B, should satisfy the relation K_A / K_B = M_B / M_A. Because the more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude, right? Since the center of mass is closer to the more massive star, so it moves less. So the ratio of velocities is inverse to the ratio of their masses.

So in system_1, we have K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s. Wait, wait, but which star is which? Let me check the problem statement again. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. Similarly, system_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. 

So for system_1, star 1 has velocity amplitude 10, star 2 has 5. Then, the mass ratio would be M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. So M2 = 2 M1. Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1. Wait, so total mass is 3 M1, but we don't know M1 or M2 individually. Similarly for system_2, their amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s, so M2_system2 / M1_system2 = K1_system2 / K2_system2 = 15/10 = 1.5. So M2 = 1.5 M1, total mass is 2.5 M1_system2.

But how do we relate the total masses between the two systems? We need another equation. Kepler's third law comes to mind. The period and the semi-major axis are related to the total mass. Kepler's third law states that (P/(2π))² = a³/(G(M1 + M2)). But we need to connect this with the radial velocities. 

Wait, for a binary system, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M sin i)/( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * 1/( (1 + q) P^(1/3) )) ), but I'm not sure if that's the exact formula. Maybe I should think more carefully. 

Alternatively, using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) a³. Here, a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. For a circular orbit, the orbital speed v is related to the semi-major axis and the period by v = 2πa/P. But since it's a two-body problem, each star is orbiting the center of mass. So the semi-major axis of each star's orbit around the center of mass, a1 and a2, should satisfy a1 + a2 = a (the total semi-major axis between the two stars). Also, M1 a1 = M2 a2. 

The velocities of the two stars would be v1 = 2πa1/P and v2 = 2πa2/P. So the ratio v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. Which confirms that the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

Therefore, in system_1: K1 = 10, K2 =5, so M2/M1 = 10/5 = 2 ⇒ M2 = 2 M1. Hence total mass of system_1 is 3 M1. 

Similarly, system_2: K1 =15, K2 =10 ⇒ M2/M1 = 15/10 = 1.5 ⇒ M2 = 1.5 M1 ⇒ total mass = 2.5 M1, where M1 is the mass of the smaller star in system_2.

But how do we relate the M1 of system_1 and M1 of system_2? Are there more equations here? Because we know the period as well, so maybe we can combine that.

Wait, Kepler's third law involves the total mass and the period. So perhaps use the RV amplitudes along with the period to find the total mass.

The formula that comes to mind is the mass function, which for a spectroscopic binary can be written in terms of the radial velocity amplitude and the period. However, the mass function requires the inclination angle i of the orbit. Since the problem mentions that the systems exhibit eclipses, that implies that the inclination is close to 90 degrees (edge-on). So sin i is approximately 1. That might allow us to use the formula assuming sin i ≈ 1.

Therefore, the mass function for each star is given by:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2π G) * (1/(1 + q)^2)

But wait, perhaps a better approach. Since both stars are observed through their radial velocities, perhaps we can express the total mass using both velocity amplitudes. Let me recall the relation:

For a binary system, the total mass M = M1 + M2. The velocity amplitudes are such that K1 = (2π a1)/P and K2 = (2π a2)/P, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of the orbits of the two stars around the center of mass. And we also know that a1 + a2 = a (the separation), and from the center of mass condition: M1 a1 = M2 a2. So M1/M2 = a2/a1. Let's note that K1/K2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. 

So combining all that with Kepler's law: P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³

But a = a1 + a2 = a1 (1 + a2/a1) = a1 (1 + M1/M2) = (a1)(M2 + M1)/M2) = (a1 M_total)/M2). Similarly, a = a1 + a2, but it's better to relate a in terms of a1 or a2.

Alternatively, since K1 = 2π a1/P, so a1 = K1 P/(2π). Similarly a2 = K2 P/(2π). Therefore, a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) P/(2π)

Then, substitute a into Kepler's law:

P² = (4π²/[G(M1 + M2)]) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P/(2π) )³ ]

Let me write this:

Left side: P²

Right side: (4π²/(G M_total)) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2π) )³ ]

So:

P² = (4π² / (G M_total)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2π)^3 ) )

Multiply stuff:

Left = P²

Right = (4π² / (G M_total)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 ) ) )

Simplify numerator denominators:

4π² divided by 8 π³ is (4 /8) * (π² / π³ ) = (1/2) * (1/π )

So:

Right = (1/(2 π G M_total)) * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) 

Set equal to left:

P² = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (2 π G M_total )

Multiply both sides by (2 π G M_total ):

2 π G M_tot

# Anthropic completion

Let's approach this problem systematically, taking into account the given information and applying our understanding of binary star systems and orbital dynamics. The key is to find a way to relate the total masses of the two systems using the provided radial velocity amplitudes and periods.

First, we recall that for a binary system, the ratio of the radial velocity amplitudes is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses: K1 / K2 = M2 / M1. This allows us to express the mass of one star in terms of the other for each system.

For system_1, with K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s, we have M2 = 2 M1. Thus, the total mass of system_1 is M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, with K1 = 15 km/s and K2 = 10 km/s, we find M2 = 1.5 M1, and the total mass is M_total_2 = M1 + M2 = 2.5 M1.

Next, we need to connect the total masses of the two systems. We can do this by leveraging Kepler's third law, which relates the period and semi-major axis to the total mass: P² = (4π² / (G M_total)) * a³.

In a binary system, the semi-major axis a can be expressed in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes and the period: a = (K1 + K2) P / (2π).

Substituting this into Kepler's third law, we obtain:

P² = (4π² / (G M_total)) * ((K1 + K2)^3 P^3) / (8 π^3)

Simplifying the right-hand side:

P² = ((K1 + K2)^3 P^3) / (2 π G M_total)

Multiplying both sides by (2 π G M_total):

2 π G M_total P² = (K1 + K2)^3 P^3

Rearranging to solve for the total mass:

M_total = ((K1 + K2)^3 P) / (2 π G)

Now we can apply this formula to both systems:

For system_1: M_total_1 = ((10 + 5)^3 * 10) / (2 π G) = 11,250 / (π G)

For system_2: M_total_2 = ((15 + 10)^3 * 5) / (2 π G) = 15,625 / (π G)

Finally, to find the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we divide their total masses:

M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (11,250 / (π G)) / (15,625 / (π G)) = 11,250 / 15,625 = 0.72

Therefore, system_1 is 0.72 times as massive as system_2, or equivalently, system_2 is 1/0.72 ≈ 1.39 times more massive than system_1.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's take a look. I need to determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2. The problem involves binary star systems that have eclipses and radial velocity (RV) amplitudes mentioned. I remember from studying that in binary star systems, the period is connected to the orbital parameters, and radial velocities can provide mass information. Oh yes, Kepler's laws might be relevant here.

Firstly, let me recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes for a binary system's stars are related to their masses. If there are two stars, A and B, with velocity amplitudes K_A and K_B, the relationship K_A / K_B = M_B / M_A holds. The more massive star will have a smaller velocity amplitude because the center of mass is closer to it, meaning it moves less. Hence, the velocity ratio is inversely proportional to the mass ratio.

Now, for system_1, we have K1 = 10 km/s and K2 = 5 km/s. But which star is assigned which amplitude? I need to check the problem description again. In system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s, respectively. Similarly, for system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s.

For system_1, star 1 has a velocity amplitude of 10, and star 2 has 5. The mass ratio is then M2/M1 = K1/K2 = 10/5 = 2. Consequently, M2 = 2 M1. Thus, the total mass for system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1. So the total mass is 3 M1, but individual values of M1 or M2 remain unknown. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s, so M2_system2 / M1_system2 = K1_system2 / K2_system2 = 15/10 = 1.5, leading to M2 = 1.5 M1, and the total mass is 2.5 M1_system2.

To relate the total masses of the two systems, we need another equation. Kepler's third law suggests itself, as it links period and semi-major axis to total mass. According to Kepler's third law, (P/(2π))² = a³/(G(M1 + M2)). We need to integrate this with radial velocities.

For a binary system, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is represented as K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M sin i) / ((M1 + M2)^(2/3)) * 1 / ((1 + q) P^(1/3)), although I'm uncertain about the exact formula. More careful consideration might be needed.

Alternatively, using Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) a³. Here, a is the orbit's semi-major axis. For a circular orbit, orbital speed v is linked to the semi-major axis and period by v = 2πa/P. Since it's a two-body problem, each star orbits the center of mass. The semi-major axes of each star's orbit around the center of mass, a1 and a2, satisfy a1 + a2 = a, and from the center of mass condition: M1 a1 = M2 a2.

The star velocities are v1 = 2πa1/P and v2 = 2πa2/P, so v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1, confirming that velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to masses. Thus, K1/K2 = M2/M1.

For system_1: K1 = 10, K2 = 5, so M2/M1 = 10/5 = 2 ⇒ M2 = 2 M1. Hence, the total mass of system_1 is 3 M1.

For system_2: K1 = 15, K2 = 10 ⇒ M2/M1 = 15/10 = 1.5 ⇒ M2 = 1.5 M1, leading to a total mass of 2.5 M1, where M1 is the smaller star's mass in system_2.

To relate M1 of system_1 with M1 of system_2, additional equations might be necessary. Since we know the period, this could be combined.

Kepler's third law involves total mass and period. Thus, perhaps combining RV amplitudes with period could yield total mass.

The mass function for spectroscopic binaries involves radial velocity amplitude and period, yet requires the orbit's inclination i. Given that the systems eclipse, suggesting an inclination near 90 degrees (edge-on), we might assume sin i = 1.

Thus, the mass function for each star is:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2π G) * (1/(1 + q)^2)

However, a different approach seems better. Since the stars' radial velocities are observed, total mass could be expressed using both velocity amplitudes. The total mass M = M1 + M2, with velocity amplitudes K1 = (2π a1)/P and K2 = (2π a2)/P, where a1 and a2 are semi-major axes of the stars' orbits around the center of mass. And since a1 + a2 = a and from center of mass condition: M1 a1 = M2 a2, then M1/M2 = a2/a1. Note that K1/K2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1.

Combining this with Kepler's law: P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³

But a = a1 + a2 = a1 (1 + a2/a1) = a1(1 + M1/M2) = (a1)(M2+M1)/M2) = (a1 M_total)/M2). Similarly, a = a1 + a2, but it's more effective to express a in terms of a1 or a2.

Alternatively, since K1 = 2π a1/P, then a1 = K1 P/(2π) and similarly a2 = K2 P/(2π). Hence, a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) P/(2π)

Substituting into Kepler's law:

P² = (4π²/[G(M1 + M2)]) * [ ((K1 + K2) P/(2π))³ ]

Writing it out:

Left side: P²

Right side: (4π²/(G M_total)) * [ ((K1 + K2) P/(2π))³ ]

So:

P² = (4π²/(G M_total)) * ((K1 + K2)³ P³)/(8 π³)

Simplifying:

4π² divided by 8 π³ equals (1/2) * (1/π)

Right side: (1/(2 π G M_total)) * ((K1 + K2)³ P³)

Equating:

P² = ((K1 + K2)³ P³) / (2 π G M_total)

Multiplying both sides by (2 π G M_total)...

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to use the radial velocity amplitudes and orbital periods of the binary star systems. Here are the key steps:

1. **Radial Velocity Amplitudes and Mass Ratios**:
   - For system_1, the radial velocity amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. The mass ratio \( M_2/M_1 = K_1/K_2 = 10/5 = 2 \), so the total mass \( M_{\text{total,1}} = M_1 + M_2 = 3M_1 \).
   - For system_2, the radial velocity amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The mass ratio \( M_2/M_1 = K_1/K_2 = 15/10 = 1.5 \), so the total mass \( M_{\text{total,2}} = M_1 + M_2 = 2.5M_1 \).

2. **Kepler's Third Law and Total Mass**:
   - Using the formula derived from Kepler's third law for the total mass of a binary system:
     \[
     M_{\text{total}} = \frac{(K_1 + K_2)^3 P}{2 \pi G}
     \]
   - For system_1: 
     \[
     M_{\text{total,1}} \propto (10 + 5)^3 \times 2 = 15^3 \times 2
     \]
   - For system_2:
     \[
     M_{\text{total,2}} \propto (15 + 10)^3 \times 1 = 25^3 \times 1
     \]

3. **Calculating the Mass Ratio**:
   - The ratio of the total masses of system_1 and system_2 is:
     \[
     \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{15^3 \times 2}{25^3 \times 1} = \frac{3375 \times 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} \approx 0.432
     \]

Thus, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.432. However, since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, the answer is:

\boxed{0.432}

---

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

P² = (K1 + K2)^3 P^3

Divide both sides by P²:

2 π G M_tot = (K1 + K2)^3 P

Therefore, solving for M_total:

M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G )

But the units here: but maybe since we can take the ratio of the masses, since G and 2π will cancel out. Let me check for each system.

So for system_1:

K1 = 10 km/s, K2 =5 km/s, so K1 + K2 =15 km/s

Period P1 =2 years

So M_total1 = (15)^3 * 2 / (2 π G ) / (conversion factors) )

Similarly, system_2: K1=15, K2=10 ⇒ K1+K2=25, P=1 year

M_total2 =25^3 *1 / (2 π G )

So when we take the ratio of M_total1 / M_total2 = (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1 )

Since the 2 π G cancels. Let me compute that.

Compute 15^3: 15*15=225, 225*15=3375

25^3:25*25=625, 625*25=15625

So M_total1 / M_total2 = (3375 * 2) / (15625 * 1 ) = 6750 /15625 = let's see, divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25=270, 15625/25=625. 270/625= 54/125= 0.432. But wait, since the question asks "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if the ratio is 0.432, that would mean system_1 is less massive, but the question states the opposite? Wait, this must be wrong. Let's re-examine.

Wait, possibly I messed up with K1 and K2.

Wait, no, for system_1: K1 is 10, K2 is 5. Their sum is 15 km/s. For system_2: their sum is 15 +10 =25? Wait, no, system 2's amplitudes are 15 and 10? Wait, no, system_2 is star 1: 15, star 2:10. So sum is 25. Then period is 1 year.

But when I calculated M_total1 and M_total2, according to:

M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 pi G )

Wait but system_1 is period 2 years, system_2 is period 1 year.

Wait then:

M_total1/M_total2 = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / [ (25)^3 * 1 ] = (3375 *2)/15625 = 6750/15625.

As before, which reduces to 270/625 = 54/125 ≈ 0.432. So system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2? Which would mean system_1 is less massive. But the question says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So that answer conflicts.

Therefore, either my formula is wrong or I made a miscalculation.

Wait, so what's wrong here. Let's think again.

Alternative approach. Let's recall that the RV amplitudes K1 and K2 lead us to M1 and M2.

We had:

From RV amplitudes:

For any binary system, if you have two stars with velocity amplitudes K1 and K2, the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2.

Because the center of mass requires M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, and the velocities are proportional to the semi-major axes (since v = 2πa/P).

Thus, K1/K2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. Hence, q = K1/K2.

So for system_1, q1 = K1/K2 =10/5 =2. Hence M2=2 M1. Thus, total mass is M1 + 2M1 = 3 M1. But how to find M1? It can be connected to the orbital parameters.

Similarly for system_2, system_2's mass ratio q2 =15/10=1.5. So M2_system2=1.5 M1_system2. Total mass is 2.5 M1_system2.

We can use Kepler's third law for both systems. Here goes.

Kepler's third law states:

(P^2 G) / (4 π²) = a^3 / (M1 + M2)

But a is the semi-major axis of the orbit of one body around the other. Wait, in the standard form, the law is:

P² (G (M1 + M2)) / (4 π²) = a³

where a is the semi-major axis of the relative orbit between the two stars. 

Alternatively, if using the version where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit of one star around the center of mass, multiplied by (1 + M1/M2) or similar... Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in terms of each star's orbit:

a1 is the semi-major axis of M1's orbit around the CM, a2 is that of M2. The total separation is a =a1 +a2. And M1 a1 = M2 a2. Hence, a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a.

Velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 would be velocities of each star:

K1 = 2 π a1 / P, K2 =2 π a2 /P

Hence, K1 = (2 π a / P) * (M2 / (M1 + M2)) and similarly for K2.

But we can use K1 + K2 = 2 π a / P.

From Kepler's law: P² = (4 π² / (G (M1 + M2))) a³

Rearranged as a³ = G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² )

Therefore, a = [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3)

Then, substituting into (K1 + K2) = 2 π a / P:

K1 + K2 = 2 π / P * [ G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

= 2 π / P * [ G (M_total) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Take 2 π / P * ( [ G M_total P² ]^(1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3) )

= 2 π / P * ( G^(1/3) M_total^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) )

Simplify terms:

= 2 π / P * G^(1/3) M_total^(1/3) P^(2/3) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) )

Combine exponents:

2 / 4^(1/3) * π / π^(2/3) * G^(1/3) M_total^(1/3) * P^(2/3) / P

Simplify each term:

2 / 4^(1/3) = 2 / (2^(2/3)) )= 2^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3 )

π / π^(2/3 )= π^(1 - 2/3) )= π^(1/3 )

P^(2/3) / P = P^(-1/3 )

So:

= 2^(1/3) π^(1/3 ) G^(1/3) M_total^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 )

Factor out (2 π G)^(1/3 )

Wait, 2^(1/3) π^(1/3 ) G^(1/3 ) = (2 π G )^(1/3 )

Therefore,

K1 + K2 = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M_total^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 )

Multiply both sides by P^(1/3 ):

(K1 + K2 ) P^(1/3 ) = (2 π G )^(1/3 ) * M_total^(1/3 )

Cube both sides:

(K1 + K2 )³ P = (2 π G ) * M_total

Then:

M_total = (K1 + K2)³ P / (2 π G )

This equation?

Wait, thereby leading us to M_total ~ (K1 + K2 )³ P / (2 π G )

So yes, this formula: M_total = (K1 + K2 )³ P / (2 π G )

But since 2 π G is constant, if we want to find a ratio M1_total / M2_total, the constants cancel. So the ratio would be:

[ (K1_1 + K2_1 )³ P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2 )³ P2 ]

Therefore, in this problem:

For system_1: K1=10, K2=5, P=2 years. So the numerator part is (15)^3 * 2

For system_2: K1=15, K2=10, P=1. So denominator part is (25)^3 *1

Thus, M1/M2= [15³*2]/[25³*1] = (3375*2)/15625 ≈ 6750/15625 =0.432.

That's 0.432, so M1 is approx 0.432 times M2. But the question asks "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?", but 0.432 is less than 1, so system_1 is less massive. That seems contradictory. Where is the mistake here?

Wait, pulling back. The problem statement says the periods: "systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2." So system_1's period is 2 years, system_2's is 1 year. So I used the correct periods.

Velocities: system_1 has RV amplitudes of 10 and 5, so sum 15. System_2: 15 and 10, sum 25. So applying the formula M_total = (K1 + K2 )³ P / (constants ), so the ratio of masses is (15³ *2)/(25³ *1)=0.432. So system_1 is about 0.43 times the mass of system_2, so less massive. But the question says system_1 is more massive. So either the problem has a mistake, or I'm applying the formula wrong.

Wait, the confusion could be about primary vs. secondary eclipses. Wait, primary eclipses are when the brighter star is eclipsed. But the problem states that periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses, which for a circular orbit, should be the orbital period. So the periods given are the orbital periods. So system_1 2 years, system_2 1 year.

Wait, but if sin(i) is different? The formula uses that K1= (2 π a1 sin i)/P. But in reality, unless the system is edge-on (i=90), we'd have K= (2 π a1 / P) sin i, but since in these systems, the eclipse is observed, meaning that the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈1, so that's valid. So assumption was made that sin i≈1.

If that's the case, the formula should be applicable. Wait, but the answer comes out contradictory to the question's expectation.

Is the formula inversely proportional? Wait, M = (K1 + K2)³ P / (2 π G ), so higher K sum and period lead to higher mass.

But system_1 has K_sum =15, P=2, system_2 K_sum=25, P=1.

15^3 *2 vs 25^3 *1, but 15³ is 3375*2=6750, 25^3=15625*1=15625. So 6750/15625 reduces as said to ~0.432, so system_1 is indeed less massive. But the question's wording expects that system 1 is more massive than system 2. Hence, perhaps this reveals a problem in the question, or perhaps my error.

Wait, alternative line of thought: In eclipsing binaries, we can observe both stars, or perhaps the velocity amplitudes are given as same as they are without inclination effect, the K values already has the sin i accounted for as 1. Maybe but the problem didn't mention uncertainties with inclination. If that's not assumption, given that it's eclipsing, the orbits are edge on. So my reasoning is correct.

But if the question says "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" perhaps this is a trick question, or perhaps the values are messed up, but step-by-step.

Alternatively, let me check the arithmetic again. Let's compute 15³ = 15*15=225; 225*15: 225*10=2250, 225*5=1125; total=2250+1125=3375

3375 multiplied by 2 is 6750

25³ is 25*25=625; 625*25=15,625

15,625 divided by 6750 is approximately 2.3148....

Wait:1 /0.432 ≈2.3148. So the inverse, meaning M2_total = 2.3148 M1_total.

So if system_1 has M_total1 and system_2 has M_total2=2.3148 M_total1. Thus system_2 is more massive by about 2.3148 × . So sorry, system_1 is less massive than system_2. Therefore, answer is about 0.432 times. So the question's premise is wrong.

But since the user provides the question, perhaps I must have messed up something. Alternatively, maybe instead of sum K1 +K2, use individual masses via K1 and K2. Wait, but in that case, earlier on, from mass ratios:

For system_1:

M_total1= M1 + M2, M2=2 M1, total=3 M1

Similarly, system_2, M_total2= 2.5 M1_prime.

But Kepler's law could link each total mass with period.

Wait, perhaps combine mass ratio with Kepler's law. Also, considering that for each system:

From the barycenter condition:

System_1:

M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, a1 + a2 =a, P=2 years.

K1=2π a1/ P, K2=2π a2 /P. Therefore, K1/K2= a1/a2= M2/M1=2.

From Kepler's law for the system: (M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³)/(G P²)

Because the traditional formula is P² = (4 π² a³)/(G(M1 + M2))

But we can also express a in terms of, say, a1 and a2. Since a = a1 + a2, and a1 = K1 P/(2 π ), a2 =K2 P/(2 π )

Therefore, a= (K1 + K2) P / (2 π )

Then substituting into Kepler's equation:

P² = (4 π² / (G(M1 + M2))) * a³

Which then becomes:

P² = 4 π²/(G(M1 + M2)) * [ (K1 + K2) P / (2 π ) ]³

This seems like returning to the same formula.

Calculating...as before...

Yes. So, again, leads to same messy result.

Alternatively, since we computed the system_1 total mass as 3 M1 and system_2 as 2.5 M1’ where the M1 and M1’ are the smaller masses in each system, maybe another approach.

For each system individually, could we relate the velocity amplitudes and period?

Consider that from the velocity amplitudes and period, for each system, 

We know that velocity amplitude K = (2πa sin i)/P, where a is semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the CM. But since we're combining the two stars' velocities, and having their mass ratios, then. Let's consider each system separately. Let's take system_1:

System_1:

K1 = 10 km/s, K2 =5 km/s. Period P =2 years.

Mass ratio q = M2/M1= K1/K2= 2. Therefore, M2=2 M1. Total mass M =M1 + 2M1=3 M1.

Each star's velocity is related to the semi-major axis of their individual orbits.

K1= 2π a1 / P ⇒ a1= K1 P /(2π)

Similarly, a2= K2 P/(2π)

The separation between the stars is a=a1 +a2= (K1 +K2) P/(2π)

From Kepler's 3rd law:

P² = (4π²/G(M)) a³

Substitute a:

P² =4π²/(G *3M1) * [ (15 *2) / (2π) *  cab be worked in proper units...Wait, but unit consistency. Let me express all in SI units.

However, perhaps since we just want the ratio of masses, the units will cancel.

Wait, alternative idea.

For system_1:

a = (10 +5) km/s*2 year / (2π)

=15 km/s *2 year /2 π

Similarly, convert to distance.

But unit analysis: (km/s)*year. Year needs to be converted to seconds. 1 year≈3.15e7 seconds. So 15 km/s=15,000 m/s

Hence, a = (15000 m/s * 2 *3.15e7 s) / (2π )

≈ (15000 *2 *3.15e7) / (2π ) meters

= (15000 *3.15e7) / π ≈ ? But this is complicated, but for each system.

However, alternatively, compare the products (K1 + K2)3 * P. The formula gives M ~ (K1 + K2)³ P. So the ratio is [(15)^3 *2 ] / [25^3 *1] =0.432 , as before.

Assuming system_1 is 0.432 times system_2. Then system_2 is 1/0.432≈2.315 times of system_1.

But the order is reversed. So here's a disconnect between my calculation and problem's question. How?

Alternatively, if the unit of velocity doesn't matter if it's km/s or other, as the ratio is the same.

Wait, unless,

Wait, wait wait: system_1 sum(K) ≈15, system_2 sum(K)=25. But maybe we have to consider that velocity amplitude and actual velocity. But formula seems applicable in any unit as long as consistent. So how is system_ M_total made smaller with higher sum K and P? 

The reason is that even though system_1 has longer period (2 vs 1), system_2 has significantly higher sum of velocities (25 vs15). The formula account the cube of sum(K), penalizing higher K more. So (25)^3 is about 2.3* (15)^3. Resulting in system_2 having higher total mass even though period is shorter.

Therefore, my conclusion, according to the calculations, is that system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of around 0.432. So the answer must be system_1 is 0.432 times as system_2, unless the question has incorrect parameters, or the initial approach is wrong.

But since the problem explicitly says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2", yet our calculation says less massive, there's a problem. Let's check yet again the calculations.

Time to check:

The derivation that M_total =( (K1 +K2 )^3 * P )/( 2 π G ). Therefore, with K in m/s, P in seconds, G=6.67e-11 m³/(kg s² )

But when we take the ratio of M_total1/M_total2,

All constants cancel, so M1/M2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1 )^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2 )^3 * P2 ]

Alternatively, check with parameters given, but converting units.

Wait P1 is 2 years, P2 is 1 year. Conversion to seconds would contribute factors, but constants really cancel. Hence, yes:

M1/M2=(15^3 *2 )/(25^3 *1 )= (3375 *2)/15625=0.432. According to the formula. So even after unit conversion, this factor remains. So the result holds.

Any alternative substitutions:

Wait but suppose because k1 and k2 are described as amplitudes of RV for each star. So for system_1, star 1's velocity is10 km/s, star2',5 km/s. Similarly system_2's, stars have15 and10.

But maybe the other way around. But maybe m/M ranges..? No, in previous worked examples, indeed the sum of (k1 +k2) raised to third power times p is in the mass formula. 

Alternatively, use the formula

(M1 + M2) = (P * (K1 + K2)^3)/(2.14e21) in solar masses, with P in days, K in km/s.

But when you take ratios, conversion factors again cancel.

Alternate sources:

Yes, for a spectroscopic binary, the formula to compute the total mass (if we know the inclination) is as above.

But given inclination ≈90 degrees for eclipsing systems, then yes, formula is valid.

Alternatively the infamous formula:

M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

Try with solar parameters. G=6.67e-11, units into solar.

Alternatively, to recheck:

But given no match with the question's intention and the answer, wonder that perhaps the formula should be reciprocal? Maybe I mishandled the velocity sum.

Wait no, clearing it all:

The formula we derived was, from start, using Kepler's law and the definition.

If a= (K1 + K2 ) P/( 2 π )

Then substituting into Kepler's equation:

P² = (4 π² a³ )/(G(M1 + M2))

So,

a³ = P² G(M1 + M2)/(4 π² )
=>a = [ P² G(M1 + M2)/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3)

Therefore, from a = (K1 + K2 ) P/( 2 π )

=> [ P² G(M1 + M2)/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) = (K1 + K2 ) P/( 2 π )

Raise both sides to cube:

 P² G(M1 + M2)/(4 π² ) = (K1 + K2 )^3 P^3/(8 π³ )

Multiply both sides by 4 π² /G P^2:

M1 + M2 = [ (K1 + K2 )^3 P^3 ]/(8 π³ ) *4 π²/(G P² )

Simplify:

M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2 )^3 P )/( 2 π G )

Yes, that's the equation everywhere. So if that's the formula, then it's correct. So the ratio is indeed:

M1/M2 = ( (15^3 *2 )/(25^3 *1 ))=0.432. System_1 is less massive.

Hence, neither numerator, denominator terms error. So where’s the confusion.

Alternatively, in the original problem, Perhaps the RV amplitudes are amplitudes for the same star. For example, for each system, one star is more massive. So in system_1, K1=10 corresponds to M2, and K2=5 corresponds to M1. Which may entail a positive result. Wait, with that in mind see mass ratio, but m1 -> mass of star withRV 5, less velocity means more mass, perhaps. So q= M1/M2= K2/K1= 5/10=0.5, hence M1=0.5 M2. So total mass is 1.5 M2.

Wait but earlier step, it depends on whether we define q as M2/M1 or M1/M2.

Waitamoment, so let's clarify:

If star1 has RV amplitude K1=10, star2 RV amplitude K2=5 for system_1. They orbit the CM. The mass ratio q= M2/M1= (velocity amplitude1)/(velocity amplitude2)= K1/K2=10/5=2. Hence, star2 is twice as massive as star1. So total mass is M1 +2 M1=3 M1.

Alternatively, if you define q= M1/M2=5/10=0.5,but t’es that in contradiction with conventional definition where q<=1 when cited. Anyway, the crucial point is the formula correctly reflect wich is the more massive star.

Yes, classical definition is q= M_secondary/ M_primary <=1, but here we’re giving velocities and amplitude and calculating total mass. Plus the formula logarithmically, which caused:

It's more accurate that M1/M2 = a2/a1=K2/K1. So the mass ratio of the other star. Therefore, correct the steps:

If in system_1, K1=10 km/s being the velocity of star1, K2=5 km/s of star2.

Then mass ratio M1/M2=K2/K1=5/10=0.5.

Hence, M1=0.5 M2. Therefore, total mass M_total= M1 + M2=1.5 M2. Alternatively =\= Prior.

Wait, so I earlier thought M1 a1= M2 a2, leading to M1/M2= a2/a1. But as a1 is larger as the star is less massive, which K1 is larger. So if star1 has higher velocity amplitude K1=10, that is a1= K1* something, which then since higher velocity amplitude corresponds to larger orbit.

Wait, I think my initial step might have the ratio exchanged.

Let me reestablish:

The center of mass condition is M1 a1 = M2 a2. Which leads to M1/M2= a2/a1. Which is, star with larger mass has smaller orbit, hence in a star system where star1 has an orbit of a1 (semi-major axis), and Star2 has a2. So the distance between them is a= a1 +a2.

Now, if star1 has a larger velocity amplitude (K1=10) compared to Star2, which has K2=5, then a1 = (K1 P)/(2π ) a2=(K2 P)/(2π ), so a1/a2= K1/K2 =2. Therefore, a1=2 a2.

Plug into mass ratio:

Since M1 / M2= a2/a1= a2/(2a2) )=0.5. So, yes, M1=0.5 M2. Therefore total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2= 0.5 M2 +M2=1.5 M2.

But earlier step if using the k-sum derivation resulted in (K1 +K2 )^3 *P /(2 pi G)  for M_total which directly give:

15^3 * 2 /（constants）= ，such that system 1's mass 3 M1 system, here would this Shine Returning that的不同？？

Wait，矛盾.

Looking back, when i adjusted the mass ratio from M2=2 M1 to M1=0.5 M2 that total mass=1.5 M2. Previously, I considered when M2=2 M1 to have 3 M1。

The confusion now is. If K1 and K2 are respective Amis's of the two stars, so:

From RVs we can only get the mass ratio q= M2/M1=K1/K2.

But per the formula for M_total:

M_total= (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G )

But how is M_total related to M1 and M2?

If q= M2/M1= K1/K2, then in system_1:

q=10/5=2, so M2=2 M1. M_total=M1 +M2=3 M1.

But how?

If K1 of system_1 corresponds to the primary star's velocity or secondary.

But sometimes in binary stars (like in SB1), but here both velocities are measured(SB2). Then it's double-lined spectroscopic binary.

But流程 to reconstruct:

We have M2 = 2 M1.

Wait, and the M_total formula above when combining systems:

1. System_1 M_total = (15)^3 *2 / (2 π G )= (3375 *2)/(2 π G )

System_2 Total= (25)^3 *1 / (2 π G )=15625/(2 π G )

Blind. Now, thus the ratio would indeed where System_1's mass = [3375*2 ]mass_constant vs system_2's [15625 ] mass_constant.

Therefore, System_1 is less by a factor '''0.432. 

But confusion arises with old derivation Versus the per mass ratio in system_es_... Well. Thus, what the problem probably wants is incorrect.

But putting all aside, maybe answer is 432/1000=54/125, reduced fraction.

Wait 0.432=54/125. Simplify each by 2:27/62.5=13.5/31.25, which isn't classic:

54 ÷ 2=27 ÷2= Nkatina perhaps is the simplist fraction.

Otherwise, likely expects an answer of ' 0.432 times', on a fordward question. Since the problem perhaps made a wording mistake, but given that how the answer script demands to enclose boxed answer, probably the correct answer on mutual basis is \boxed{0.432}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the relationship derived from Kepler's third law and the radial velocity amplitudes:

\[
M_{\text{total}} \propto \frac{(K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P}{2\pi G}
\]

**For system_1:**
- \(K_1 + K_2 = 10 + 5 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)
- \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)

**For system_2:**
- \(K_1 + K_2 = 15 + 10 = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)
- \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)

The ratio of the total masses is:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

However, this result indicates that system_1 is **less massive** than system_2 by a factor of 0.432. Since the question asks by what factor system_1 is **more massive**, there's a contradiction. Assuming the problem intended to ask the opposite (factor by which system_2 is more massive), the answer would be the reciprocal:

\[
\frac{1}{0.432} \approx 2.315
\]

But adhering strictly to the given question and calculation, the correct factor based on the provided data is:

**Answer:** \(\boxed{0.43}\) (However, note that this implies system_1 is less massive.)

---

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

However, this contradicts our initial calculation. Let's check the steps again.

Wait, there's a mistake here. Let's re-examine the substitution into Kepler's law. The correct expression after substitution should be:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

But let's verify the derivation again. Starting from Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² / (G M_total)) * a³

And the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital velocities. The orbital velocity of each star is v = 2 π a_i / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of each star's orbit around the center of mass. The total semi-major axis a = a1 + a2. Since the center of mass is the balance point, M1 a1 = M2 a2. Therefore, a1 = (M2 / (M1 + M2)) a and a2 = (M1 / (M1 + M2)) a. The velocities are then v1 = 2 π a1 / P = (2 π a / P) * (M2 / (M1 + M2)) and similarly for v2. Therefore, the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related to the total mass and the period. However, this might complicate things. Alternatively, using the formula that combines Kepler's law with the velocity amplitudes.

Another approach is to use the formula for the mass function, but since the inclination is not given, we might need to assume edge-on orbits (i=90 degrees) to simplify. However, since the problem states that the periods are the time between eclipses, which implies that the orbital plane is edge-on, so inclination is 90 degrees. Therefore, the radial velocity amplitudes are the true velocities.

In that case, the total mass can be calculated using the formula:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

But let's check the units. If K is in km/s, P in years, we need to convert units to SI units (m, s, kg). Alternatively, use astronomical units. Let's recall that in the formula, when using appropriate units, the constants can be absorbed. However, since we are taking a ratio between the two systems, the constants will cancel out. Therefore, we can compute the ratio of the total masses as:

M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Where K1_1 = 10 km/s, K2_1 = 5 km/s, P1 = 2 years; K1_2 = 15 km/s, K2_2 = 10 km/s, P2 = 1 year.

Plugging in the numbers:

M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (10 + 5)^3 * 2 ] / [ (15 + 10)^3 * 1 ] = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432

So the ratio is 0.432, meaning system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, or system_2 is approximately 2.315 times more massive than system_1. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. If the ratio is 0.432, then system_1 is less massive. But this contradicts the initial thought. There must be an error in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

But when taking the ratio, since G and 2 π are constants, the ratio becomes:

M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Which is what I did. So according to this, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, which would mean system_2 is more massive. But the problem states "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the ratio is 0.432, then system_1 is less massive. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let's recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes are related to the masses via:

K1 = (2 π G / (P * (1 - e^2)^(3/2)))^(1/3) * (M2^3 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly for K2. However, since the orbits are eclipsing, we can assume e ≈ 0 (circular) and i = 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin i = 1. Then:

K1 = (2 π G / P)^(1/3) * (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )^(1/3)

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, combining K1 and K2:

K1 / K2 = M2 / M1

So from system_1: K1 = 10, K2 = 5, so M2 = 2 M1. Therefore, total mass M_total_1 = 3 M1.

Similarly, system_2: K1 = 15, K2 = 10, so M2 = 1.5 M1. Total mass M_total_2 = 2.5 M1.

But we need to relate M_total_1 and M_total_2. To do this, we need another equation involving the total mass. This comes from Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the total mass M_total:

P^2 = (4 π^2 a^3) / (G M_total)

But the semi-major axis a is the sum of the semi-major axes of the two stars' orbits around the center of mass: a = a1 + a2. From the definition of the center of mass, M1 a1 = M2 a2, so a1 = (M2 / M_total) a and a2 = (M1 / M_total) a. Therefore, a = a1 + a2 = (M2 + M1) a / M_total = a. Wait, that's trivial. Alternatively, the semi-major axis of the orbit of one star around the other is a = a1 + a2. But Kepler's law uses the semi-major axis of the orbit of one body around the other, which is a = a1 + a2. However, the period is the same for both stars.

Alternatively, the orbital velocities are related to the semi-major axis. The velocity of each star is v = 2 π a_i / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of their orbit around the center of mass. So:

v1 = 2 π a1 / P

v2 = 2 π a2 / P

But since a1 = (M2 / M_total) a and a2 = (M1 / M_total) a, where a is the total separation between the two stars. Then:

v1 = 2 π (M2 / M_total) a / P

v2 = 2 π (M1 / M_total) a / P

Adding these, v1 + v2 = 2 π a / P

But the sum of the velocities is also K1 + K2 = v1 + v2 = 2 π a / P

Therefore, a = (K1 + K2) P / (2 π)

Now, substituting this into Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 π^2 / (G M_total)) * a^3

Substitute a:

P^2 = (4 π^2 / (G M_total)) * [ (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) ]^3

Simplify the right-hand side:

= (4 π^2 / (G M_total)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 )

= (4 π^2 * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 G M_total )

= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (2 π G M_total )

Now, multiply both sides by 2 π G M_total:

2 π G M_total P^2 = (K1 + K2)^3 P^3

Divide both sides by P^2:

2 π G M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P

Therefore, solving for M_total:

M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G )

This is the same formula as before. Therefore, the ratio of the total masses is:

M_total_1 / M_total_2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 P2 ]

Plugging in the values:

For system_1: K1 + K2 = 15 km/s, P1 = 2 years

For system_2: K1 + K2 = 25 km/s, P2 = 1 year

So:

M_total_1 / M_total_2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432

Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Since 0.432 < 1, this would mean system_1 is less massive. However, this contradicts the initial assumption. Where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the formula should have the period in seconds and velocities in m/s, but since we are taking the ratio, the units cancel out. Let's verify:

If we use the same units for both systems, the ratio remains the same. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, system_1 is indeed less massive than system_2 by a factor of 0.432. But the problem states "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" If the answer is 0.432, then the question might have a mistake, or perhaps I made an error in interpreting the problem.

Wait, let's check the problem statement again:

"By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars."

But according to our calculation, system_1 is less massive. However, let's check the given data:

System_1: K1=10, K2=5, P=2 years

System_2: K1=15, K2=10, P=1 year

The formula gives M_total proportional to (K1+K2)^3 * P. For system_1: (15)^3 * 2 = 3375 * 2 = 6750

For system_2: (25)^3 * 1 = 15625

Ratio: 6750 / 15625 = 0.432

So system_1 is 0.432 times system_2, meaning system_2 is more massive. Therefore, the answer should be that system_1 is less massive, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive. This suggests either a mistake in the problem statement or in our approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let's consider the mass ratio from the velocity amplitudes.

For each system, the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2.

For system_1: q1 = 10/5 = 2, so M2 = 2 M1. Total mass M1 + M2 = 3 M1.

For system_2: q2 = 15/10 = 1.5, so M2 = 1.5 M1. Total mass M1 + M2 = 2.5 M1.

But we need to relate M1 in system_1 to M1 in system_2. To do this, we need another equation involving the total mass, which comes from Kepler's law.

From Kepler's third law:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³) / (G P²)

But a is related to the velocities. The separation a can be expressed as a = (K1 + K2) P / (2 π), as derived earlier.

Substituting into Kepler's law:

M_total = (4 π² / (G P²)) * [ (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) ]³

= (4 π² / (G P²)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³ )

= (4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³ G P² )

= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 π G )

Which is the same as before. Therefore, the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

Therefore, the ratio is indeed 0.432, meaning system_1 is less massive. However, the problem asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or perhaps a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the periods given are not the orbital periods but the eclipse periods. However, the problem states: "periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses." In a circular orbit, the time between eclipses is equal to the orbital period. Therefore, the periods given are indeed the orbital periods.

Given that, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer is that system_1 is less massive by a factor of 0.432, but the question asks the opposite. This discrepancy suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem setup or in the provided parameters. However, based on the given data and standard formulas, the calculation leads to system_1 being less massive.

But let's double-check the formula derivation once more. The key equation is:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

But when we take the ratio, the constants cancel, so:

M_total_1 / M_total_2 = ( (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ) / ( (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 )

Plugging in:

(15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = (3375 * 2) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432

Yes, this is correct. Therefore, unless there's a different interpretation, the answer is 0.432, but since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, and the result is less than 1, it's actually system_2 that's more massive. Therefore, the answer should be expressed as the reciprocal, 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315, but the question specifically asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive. Since the factor is less than 1, the correct answer is that system_1 is not more massive; system_2 is more massive. However, this contradicts the question's phrasing. It's possible that there was a mistake in the problem statement, swapping the systems or the parameters. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's check the exponents again. The formula is M_total ∝ (K1 + K2)^3 * P. So higher velocities and longer period lead to higher mass. System_1 has K1+K2=15, P=2. System_2 has K1+K2=25, P=1. So (15/25)^3 = (3/5)^3 = 27/125 ≈ 0.216, multiplied by P ratio 2/1 = 0.432. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Therefore, the answer is 0.432, but since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, which it isn't. However, given the problem's phrasing, perhaps we are to provide the absolute value of the ratio, but the answer should be that system_1 is less massive. Given that, there might be an error in the problem, but based on the given data, the answer is 0.432. However, the problem might expect us to consider the mass ratio differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the total mass is different. Let's consider the individual masses. For each system, we can express the masses in terms of the velocity amplitudes and period.

For system_1:

M1 = (K2 (K1 + K2)^2 P) / (2 π G)

M2 = (K1 (K1 + K2)^2 P) / (2 π G)

Therefore, total mass M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G )

Same as before. Therefore, the ratio is indeed 0.432.

Given that, the answer should be 0.432, but since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, and the answer is less than 1, there's a contradiction. However, perhaps the question intended to ask the opposite, or there's a typo in the parameters. Assuming the calculation is correct, the answer is 0.432, but since the question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive, and it's actually less massive, the answer should be 1/0.432 ≈ 2.315, but that's speculative. Alternatively, the problem might have a different approach.

Wait, another way: the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2.

For system_1: q1 = 10/5 = 2, so M2 = 2 M1. Total mass M_total1 = 3 M1.

For system_2: q2 = 15/10 = 1.5, so M2 = 1.5 M1. Total mass M_total2 = 2.5 M1.

But to find the relationship between M_total1 and M_total2, we need to relate M1 in system_1 to M1 in system_2. This requires another equation, which comes from Kepler's law.

From Kepler's third law:

M_total = (4 π² a³) / (G P²)

But a is related to the separation. The separation a can be expressed in terms of the velocities and period. The orbital velocity of each star is v = 2 π a_i / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit. Since a = a1 + a2, and a1 = (M2 / M_total) a, a2 = (M1 / M_total) a.

The velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are the maximum radial velocities, which for edge-on orbits are equal to the actual orbital velocities. Therefore:

K1 = 2 π a1 / P = 2 π (M2 / M_total) a / P

Similarly, K2 = 2 π a2 / P = 2 π (M1 / M_total) a / P

Adding these:

K1 + K2 = 2 π a / P

Therefore, a = (K1 + K2) P / (2 π)

Substituting into Kepler's law:

M_total = (4 π² / (G P²)) * [ (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) ]³

= (4 π² / (G P²)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³ )

= (4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³ G P² )

= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P ) / (2 π G )

Which is the same result as before. Therefore, the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

Thus, the ratio M_total1 / M_total2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1) = 0.432.

Therefore, system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, the answer would be 0.432, but this indicates it's less massive. Given the problem's phrasing, this seems contradictory. However, based on the calculations, this is the result. It's possible that there's a mistake in the problem's parameters, but assuming they are correct, the answer is 0.432. However, since the question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive, and the answer is less than 1, it's likely that there was an error in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the periods were swapped. If the periods were 1 year for system_1 and 2 years for system_2, the ratio would be (15^3 *1)/(25^3 *2)= 3375 / 31250 ≈ 0.108, which is even worse. Alternatively, if the velocity amplitudes were swapped, but that's speculative.

Given the problem as stated, the answer is 0.432, but since the question asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive, and the answer is less than 1, there's an inconsistency. However, based on the calculation, the answer is 0.432, and perhaps the question intended to ask the opposite, in which case the answer would be approximately 2.315. But without further information, we must go with the calculation as per the given data.

But wait, let's check the units again. The formula M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G) requires that the units are consistent. If K is in m/s, P in seconds, G in m³/kg/s², then the units would be:

(m/s)^3 * s / (m³/kg/s²) ) = (m³/s³ * s) / (m³/kg/s²) ) = (m³/s²) / (m³/kg/s²) ) = kg

Which is correct. However, if we use km/s and years, we need to convert to SI units. Let's try that.

For system_1:

K1 + K2 = 15 km/s = 15,000 m/s

P = 2 years = 2 * 365.25 * 24 * 3600 ≈ 2 * 31,557,600 ≈ 63,115,200 seconds

G = 6.67430 × 10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2

M_total1 = (15,000)^3 * 63,115,200 / (2 π * 6.6743e-11)

Similarly for system_2:

K1 + K2 = 25 km/s = 25,000 m/s

P = 1 year ≈ 31,557,600 seconds

M_total2 = (25,000)^3 * 31,557,600 / (2 π * 6.6743e-11)

Calculating the ratio:

M_total1 / M_total2 = [ (15,000^3 * 63,115,200) / (2 π G) ] / [ (25,000^3 * 31,557,600) / (2 π G) ] = (15^3 * 63.1152) / (25^3 * 31.5576)

But since we are using the same units for both, the exact conversion factors cancel out. Let's compute:

15^3 = 3375

25^3 = 15625

63.1152 / 31.5576 = 2

Therefore, ratio = (3375 * 2) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432

Same result. Therefore, the calculation is correct. Thus, the answer is 0.432, but the question's phrasing is contradictory. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is 0.432, and the question has a typo. Alternatively, the answer should be presented as 0.432, acknowledging that system_1 is less massive. However, since the problem explicitly asks by what factor system_1 is more massive, and the answer is less than 1, there's an inconsistency. But based on the calculation, the answer is 0.432.

To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we use the radial velocity amplitudes and the orbital periods of the binary systems. The key formula derived from Kepler's third law and the relationship between radial velocities and masses is:

\[
M_{\text{total}} \propto (K_1 + K_2)^3 \times P
\]

where \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars in the system, and \(P\) is the orbital period.

For system_1:
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Period: \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)
- Sum of velocities: \(K_1 + K_2 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)

For system_2:
- Radial velocity amplitudes: \(K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Period: \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)
- Sum of velocities: \(K_1 + K_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)

The ratio of the total masses of the two systems is calculated as:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total1}}}{M_{\text{total2}}} = \frac{(K_1 + K_2)_1^3 \times P_1}{(K_1 + K_2)_2^3 \times P_2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total1}}}{M_{\text{total2}}} = \frac{(15)^3 \times 2}{(25)^3 \times 1} = \frac{3375 \times 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} = \frac{54}{125} \approx 0.432
\]

Thus, the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

:

2 π G M_total P² = (K1 + K2)³ P³

Divide both sides by P²:

2 π G M_total = (K1 + K2)³ P

Therefore:

M_total = (K1 + K2)³ P / (2 π G)

But wait, this seems different from standard expressions. Let me check.

Alternatively, another standard formula is that for the total mass:

M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G sin^3 i)

But since the systems are eclipsing, sin i ≈ 1, so:

M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G)

But here, perhaps the formula is in terms of solar masses, with P in years, and velocities in km/s. Maybe it's better to convert everything into SI units.

Alternatively, recall the formula for the mass function:

f(M) = (P * K^3) / (2π G) * (1/(1 + q)^2)

But when sin i = 1, then f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = M2^3 / (M_total^2 )

But in our case, since we have both K1 and K2, and q = M2/M1 = K1/K2, perhaps we can express M_total in terms of K1, K2, and P.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula from Kepler's third law with the velocity amplitudes.

Since M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

But let's check the units. If we use SI units:

G = 6.674×10^-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2

P in seconds,

K1 and K2 in m/s.

Then M_total would be in kg.

But since the problem asks for the ratio of masses between system_1 and system_2, perhaps the constants would cancel out.

But maybe there is an easier way. Since the problem gives periods in years, and velocities in km/s. Let's see if there is a simplified version of the formula when using certain units.

Alternatively, use the formula for the total mass:

M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2) )^3 * P / ( (2 π G) )

But to compute the ratio between system_1 and system_2, we can set up:

M_total1 / M_total2 = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Because G and 2π are constants that would cancel in the ratio.

Yes, that's correct. So, since the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

Therefore, the ratio would be:

(M_total1 / M_total2) = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Now, plug in the numbers.

For system_1:

K1_1 = 10 km/s, K2_1 = 5 km/s, so K_total1 = 15 km/s

P1 = 2 years

For system_2:

K1_2 =15 km/s, K2_2 =10 km/s, so K_total2 =25 km/s

P2 =1 year

Thus,

(M_total1 / M_total2) = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / [ (25)^3 *1 ] = (3375 * 2) / 15625 = 6750 / 15625

Compute that:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270 / 625

Divide by 5: 54 / 125

Approximately 0.432. So system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Wait, but the question asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? But according to this calculation, system_1 is less massive. That seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.

Wait, the formula I derived was M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G)

But in reality, perhaps the formula is different. Let me rederive it.

Starting from Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² / G(M1 + M2)) ) * a³

But a = a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of the two stars' orbits around the center of mass. The orbital velocity of each star is v1 = 2 π a1 / P and v2 = 2 π a2 / P. So a1 = v1 P / (2 π) and a2 = v2 P / (2 π). Thus, a = (v1 + v2) P / (2 π). Substitute into Kepler's equation:

P² = (4 π² / G(M1 + M2)) ) * ( (v1 + v2) P / (2 π) )³

Simplify the RHS:

(4 π² / G(M1 + M2)) * ( (v1 + v2)^3 P³ ) / (8 π³ )

Multiply terms:

(4 π² * (v1 + v2)^3 P³ ) / (8 π³ G(M1 + M2) )

Simplify coefficients:

4 /8 = 1/2; π² / π³ = 1/π

So:

( (v1 + v2)^3 P³ ) / (2 π G (M1 + M2) )

Set equal to LHS P²:

P² = ( (v1 + v2)^3 P³ ) / (2 π G (M1 + M2) )

Multiply both sides by (2 π G (M1 + M2) ):

2 π G (M1 + M2) P² = (v1 + v2)^3 P³

Divide both sides by P²:

2 π G (M1 + M2) = (v1 + v2)^3 P

Solve for M1 + M2:

M1 + M2 = (v1 + v2)^3 P / (2 π G)

So yes, the formula is M_total = (v1 + v2)^3 P / (2 π G). Therefore, the ratio is indeed [ (v1 + v2)_1^3 P1 ] / [ (v1 + v2)_2^3 P2 ]

But in the problem statement, the RV amplitudes are given. In a binary system, the velocity amplitudes of the two stars are K1 and K2. But the formula here requires the sum of the velocities (v1 + v2). But since the stars are moving in opposite directions, the relative velocity between them is K1 + K2, but in the center of mass frame, each star's velocity is K1 and K2. So a1 = K1 * P / (2 π), a2 = K2 * P / (2 π), so a = a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π). Then substituting into Kepler's third law, we get M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G)

But then when calculating the ratio, yes, M_total1/M_total2 = ( (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ) / ( (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 )

Therefore, plugging in:

System_1: K1 + K2 = 10 + 5 = 15 km/s, P1 = 2 years

System_2: K1 + K2 =15 +10=25 km/s, P2=1 year

So:

M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 *1 ) = (3375 * 2)/15625 ≈ 6750 /15625 ≈0.432

Thus, system_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_2 is more massive by a factor of 1 /0.432 ≈2.3148.

But the question asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. But according to this, system_1 is less massive. Did I misinterpret the problem?

Wait, let's check the problem again: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

But according to calculations, M1/M2 = ~0.432, which would mean system_1 is less massive. Therefore, either the calculation is wrong, or perhaps the answer is that system_1 is less massive, but the problem states "more massive". This suggests a possible error in reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I confused system_1 and system_2 in the calculation. Let's check again.

System_1: sum K =15, P=2. System_2: sum K=25, P=1.

Thus:

M1 = (15^3 * 2)/(2 π G)

M2 = (25^3 *1 )/(2 π G)

Thus, M1/M2 = (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1 )= (3375 *2)/15625 = 6750/15625=0.432.

Thus, M1 is indeed 0.432 times M2, so system_1 is less massive. But the problem asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. Contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the error is in the formula.

Wait, perhaps instead of the sum of velocities, it should be related to the individual masses. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since the velocity amplitudes are given for each star, and using the mass ratio.

For each system:

System_1:

K1 =10 km/s, K2=5 km/s

Mass ratio q1 = M2/M1 = K1/K2 =10/5=2. Therefore, M2=2 M1. Total mass M_total1 =3 M1.

System_2:

K1=15, K2=10, so q2=15/10=1.5, so M2=1.5 M1. Total mass M_total2=2.5 M1.

But without knowing the actual values of M1 in each system, how can we compare their total masses? Unless using Kepler's law which relates the total mass to the period and the semi-major axis.

But for that, we need to relate the semi-major axis to the velocities. Since the velocity amplitude K is related to the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the center of mass, and the period.

For a star with velocity amplitude K, the semi-major axis of its orbit is a = K * P / (2 π).

But each star has its own semi-major axis, a1 and a2, such that a1 + a2 =a, the semi-major axis of the relative orbit.

But Kepler's law uses the total semi-major axis a.

Therefore, the total semi-major axis a =a1 +a2 = (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π)

Then Kepler's third law is:

P² = (4 π² / (G M_total)) * a³

Substitute a:

P² = (4 π² / (G M_total)) * [ (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) ]³

Simplify:

Left side: P²

Right side: (4 π² / (G M_total)) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P³ ) / (8 π³ )

= (4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P³ ) / (8 π³ G M_total )

= ( (K1 + K2)^3 P³ ) / (2 π G M_total )

Thus:

P² = ( (K1 + K2)^3 P³ ) / (2 π G M_total )

Multiply both sides by (2 π G M_total ):

2 π G M_total P² = (K1 + K2)^3 P³

Divide by P²:

2 π G M_total P = (K1 + K2)^3 P³

Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, no:

Wait, if after multiplying both sides by (2 π G M_total ), we get:

2 π G M_total P² = (K1 + K2)^3 P³

Then, divide both sides by P²:

2 π G M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P

Therefore,

M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G )

Thus, the formula is correct as previously.

Therefore, the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 multiplied by the period. Hence, the ratio of the total masses is ( (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ) / ( (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 )

Given the numbers:

For system_1:

K1 + K2 =15 km/s, P1=2 years

For system_2:

K1 + K2=25 km/s, P2=1 year

Therefore:

M1/M2= (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1)= (3375*2)/15625=6750/15625=0.432.

So M1=0.432 M2. Hence, system_1 is less massive. However, the problem states: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" Contradiction here.

Therefore, either the problem's wording is incorrect, or I made a mistake in interpreting the velocity amplitudes. Let me check again the problem statement.

" Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses."

" Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s."

So, system_1 has velocities 10 and 5, system_2 has 15 and10. So, the calculation seems correct. So system_1 is less massive. But the problem says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2". This is confusing.

Possibility: Did I mix up system_1 and system_2 in the calculation? Let's check:

No, system_1 has K1=10 and K2=5, sum 15, P=2. system_2 has K1=15 and K2=10, sum 25, P=1. Then M1/M2=(15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1)=0.432, so system_1 is 0.432 times system_2. Hence, system_2 is more massive by a factor of ~2.315.

But the problem asks the reverse. Maybe I misread which system has which period.

Wait, the problem says: "periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2." So system_1 has period 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.

Therefore, my calculation is correct. Then, the answer is that system_1 is less massive. But the question says the opposite. Therefore, the problem might have an error, or perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass ratio with another formula.

Wait, another approach: For each system, using the fact that the mass function requires the inclination. But since the system is eclipsing, inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1.

The mass function for each star is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2 π G) * 1 / (1 + q)^2, but with sin i=1.

But since we have both masses, perhaps we can use the following: the mass function for star 1 in system_1 is f(M1) = (K2^3 P) / (2943.3) [using units where P is in days, K in km/s, and mass in solar masses], but perhaps not helpful here.

Alternatively, using the relation for each system:

For each binary system, the total mass is given by:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

But if we compute this for each system, the ratio would be as above.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the interpretation of the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, in binary stars, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the other star. For example, the semi-amplitude of star A (K_A) is given by:

K_A = (2 π G / (P c^3 ))^{1/3} * (M_B sin i) / ( (M_A + M_B)^{2/3} )

But this might complicate things further.

Alternatively, use the formula for each star:

K1 = (2 π G / (P * (M1 + M2)^2 ))^{1/3} * M2 sin i

Similarly,

K2 = (2 π G / (P * (M1 + M2)^2 ))^{1/3} * M1 sin i

Then, since sin i=1,

K1/K2 = M2/M1

Which gives the same mass ratio as before.

Therefore, K1 + K2 = (2 π G / (P * (M1 + M2)^2 ))^{1/3} * (M2 + M1 )

Hence,

K1 + K2 = (2 π G )^{1/3} * (M1 + M2 )^{1/3} / ( P^{1/3} (M1 + M2)^{2/3} ) ) * (M1 + M2 )

Wait, let's do the steps:

Let me write the expression for K1:

K1 = [ (2 π G ) / ( P (M1 + M2)^2 ) ]^{1/3} * M2

Similarly, K2 = same expression with M1 instead of M2.

Thus,

K1 + K2 = [ (2 π G ) / ( P (M1 + M2)^2 ) ]^{1/3} * (M1 + M2 )

Simplify:

= (2 π G )^{1/3} / ( P^{1/3} (M1 + M2)^{2/3} ) * (M1 + M2 )

= (2 π G )^{1/3} * (M1 + M2)^{1 - 2/3} / P^{1/3}

= (2 π G )^{1/3} * (M1 + M2)^{1/3} / P^{1/3}

Thus,

K1 + K2 = (2 π G )^{1/3} * (M_total)^{1/3} / P^{1/3}

Cube both sides:

(K1 + K2)^3 = (2 π G ) * M_total / P

Thus,

M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 P / (2 π G )

Which is the same formula as before. So this confirms the previous result.

Therefore, the total mass is indeed proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 multiplied by the period. Therefore, the ratio is as computed.

So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.432. But the problem states the opposite. Therefore, perhaps the problem has an error in the velocity amplitudes or periods. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly. Alternatively, I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought. The period in the formula is in seconds, but in the ratio calculation, since we use the same units for both systems (years), but the velocity in km/s.

But when calculating the ratio, since both systems use the same units for P (years) and K (km/s), the unit conversions would cancel out, so the ratio is correctly calculated as (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1)=0.432, so system_1 is less massive.

But the problem asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. Hence, there must be a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I added the velocities incorrectly. In system_1, K1 and K2 are 10 and 5, so sum is 15. In system_2, K1=15 and K2=10, sum=25. Correct.

Therefore, the ratio is (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1)=0.432.

But maybe we need to consider that the period given is the orbital period. Since the time between eclipses is the orbital period. So period is correct.

Alternatively, the problem might be referring to the mass ratio of the two stars individually, but the question is about the total mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the mass ratio, and the sum of the masses. Let's think differently.

Given the mass ratios for each system:

In system_1, M2/M1=2, so M1= M1, M2=2 M1. Total mass=3 M1.

In system_2, M2/M1=1.5, so M1= M1, M2=1.5 M1. Total mass=2.5 M1.

But without knowledge of the individual masses, how do we compare the total masses between the two systems?

We need another equation involving the total mass. This is where Kepler's law comes into play. But in order to use Kepler's law, we need to relate velocity amplitudes to the total mass.

Alternatively, use the formula for the semi-major axis.

For each star in system_1:

The semi-amplitude of star 1's velocity is 10 km/s, which equals 2 π a1 / P.

Thus, a1 = (10 km/s * 2 years) / (2 π )

Similarly, a2 = (5 km/s * 2 years ) / (2 π )

Then the total semi-major axis a =a1 + a2= (10 +5 )*2 / (2 π ) km/s years

Wait, units are mixed. Let's convert years to seconds.

1 year ≈ 3.1536×10^7 seconds.

Thus, P1=2 years=6.3072×10^7 seconds.

Velocity in km/s: 10 km/s=10^4 m/s.

Thus, a1= (10^4 m/s *6.3072×10^7 s ) / (2 π )= (6.3072×10^11 ) / (2 π ) meters ≈1.004×10^11 meters.

Similarly, a2= (5×10^3 m/s *6.3072×10^7 s ) / (2 π )=5×6.3072×10^10 / (2 π )≈5.021×10^10 meters.

Total a=1.004e11 +5.021e10=1.506e11 meters.

Then using Kepler's law:

P²=4 π² a³/(G(M1 + M2))

So, M1 + M2=4 π² a³/(G P² )

Compute for system_1:

a=1.506e11 meters

P=6.3072e7 seconds

G=6.674e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²

Calculate:

Numerator:4 π²*(1.506e11)^3≈4*(9.8696)*(1.506^3*10^33)≈39.478*(3.413e33)=1.347e35

Denominator:G*P²=6.674e-11*(6.3072e7)^2≈6.674e-11*(3.977e15)=6.674e-11*3.977e15≈2.656e5

Thus, M_total=1.347e35 /2.656e5≈5.07e29 kg

Solar mass is ~1.9885e30 kg, so M_total≈0.255 solar masses.

Similarly, for system_2:

Velocities 15 and10 km/s, P=1 year=3.1536e7 seconds.

Compute a1=15e3 m/s *3.1536e7 s/(2 π )≈15e3*3.1536e7 /6.283≈15*3.1536e10 /6.283≈4.7304e11 /6.283≈7.53e10 meters

a2=10e3*3.1536e7/(2 π )≈10e3*3.1536e7 /6.283≈3.1536e11 /6.283≈5.02e10 meters

Total a=7.53e10 +5.02e10=1.255e11 meters

Compute M_total=4 π² a³/(G P² )

a=1.255e11 meters

P=3.1536e7 s

Numerator=4 π²*(1.255e11)^3≈4*9.8696*(1.976e33)=39.478*1.976e33≈7.80e34

Denominator=G*P²=6.674e-11*(3.1536e7)^2≈6.674e-11*9.94e14≈6.674e-11*9.94e14≈6.634e4

Thus, M_total=7.80e34 /6.634e4≈1.176e30 kg≈0.591 solar masses

Therefore, system_1 is≈0.255 solar masses, system_2≈0.591 solar masses. Thus, system_2 is more massive by factor≈0.591/0.255≈2.318.

Therefore, the factor is≈2.318, so system_1 is less massive, system_2 is more massive by factor≈2.318. Hence, if the problem asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, the answer would be≈0.432, or the reciprocal≈2.315 if the question intended system_2 more massive.

But since the problem states system_1 should be more massive, but according to calculations, it's not. Hence, either the question is flawed, or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, but when I computed using SI units, system_1's total mass≈0.255 solar masses, system_2≈0.591 solar masses. So system_2 is indeed more massive. Therefore, the answer should be system_2 is more massive by a factor of≈2.3, so system_1 is less massive. But the problem says "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2". This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem's parameters or a misinterpretation.

Wait, going back to the beginning. The key formula is that the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. Therefore, in system_1, it's (15)^3 *2, and in system_2, it's (25)^3 *1. So system_1's total mass: 3375*2=6750, system_2: 15625*1=15625. So ratio is 6750:15625= 27:62.5= 54:125≈0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times system_2. Hence, system_2 is 1/0.432≈2.315 times more massive.

But the problem asks "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2". The answer would be this factor, but since system_1 is less massive, perhaps the problem intended to ask the reverse. However, given the data provided, the answer is that system_1 is less massive. Hence, if we proceed, the answer is approximately 0.432, but since the problem asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive, the answer might need to be inverted, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different formula where the mass is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitudes. For example, if mass is proportional to velocity amplitude, but that contradicts physics.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the mass of the primary star in each system, not the total mass. But the problem says "the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars".

Alternatively, perhaps the period in the formula is the sidereal period, but the eclipse period is different. Wait, but the problem states "periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses." The time between eclipses should be the orbital period if the orbit is circular. Hence, P is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use only the velocity amplitudes and the mass ratio, but how?

If the mass ratio is q= M2/M1= K1/K2, then for system_1, q=2, and total mass= M1 + M2=3 M1.

For system_2, q=1.5, total mass=2.5 M1.

But without another equation linking M1 between the two systems, we can't find the ratio of total masses. Thus, we must use Kepler's law, which requires the period and the velocity amplitudes. Hence, the previous calculation is necessary.

Therefore, unless the problem has a mistake in numbers or wording, the answer should be that system_1 is less massive. But since the problem asks the opposite, I must consider that perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, the problem says "sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s". Does this mean that each star's radial velocity has amplitude 10 and 5 km/s, or that the system's velocity relative to us has those amplitudes? No, in a binary system, each star's radial velocity has a semi-amplitude of K1 and K2. Hence, the given data is correct.

Thus, I think the correct answer is that system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~2.315, but since the problem asks the opposite, there might be an error. Alternatively, the answer should be expressed as the reciprocal, but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe in the formula, the period is inversely related. Let me check again.

The formula is M_total = (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G ). Hence, longer P leads to higher mass. But system_1 has P=2, system_2 has P=1. So even though system_1 has longer period, its velocity sum is smaller (15 vs 25), so the combination of (15)^3 *2 vs (25)^3 *1 still makes system_1 less massive.

Therefore, unless the problem's parameters are entered incorrectly, the conclusion stands. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 0.432, but since the problem states "more massive", the answer is the reciprocal, but this is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the exponents. Let's compute again:

(M1/M2) = ( (15/25)^3 ) * (2/1 ) = (0.6)^3 * 2 =0.216*2=0.432.

Yes, that's correct. Hence, the answer is 0.432, but since it's asked as "more massive", it's possible the answer should be the inverse, but that is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed, but the user input the parameters correctly. If the problem says system_1 has period 2 years and system_2 has period 1 year, then there's no error.

Alternatively, perhaps the RV amplitudes are swapped.

But in system_1, the amplitudes are 10 and 5, in system_2, 15 and10.

Therefore, based on the data, the answer is system_1 is less massive. Therefore, given that the problem asks for the factor by which system_1 is more massive, but according to the calculation, it's not, perhaps this is a trick question, and the answer is that system_1 is not more massive, but less massive.

But since the problem explicitly asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's parameters, or the answer is a negative number, which is illogical. Alternatively, the correct answer is 0.432, but phrased as "system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2", but the question wants the factor by which it's more massive, which would be less than 1.

Alternatively, the answer is 2.315, but inverted. Since system_2 is 2.315 times more massive, the factor by which system_1 is more massive is 1/2.315≈0.432. But the wording is crucial. If system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, then the factor is 0.432. If the question is "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2", the answer should be that it's not more massive, but if forced to give a numerical factor, 0.432.

But in many textbooks, when asked "by what factor is X more massive than Y", it refers to how many times X's mass is greater than Y's. If X is less massive, the factor is less than 1. So, in this case, the answer would be 0.432, even though it's less than 1.

Hence, the answer is 0.432, which is approximately 27/62.5 or 54/125. Simplify 54/125: both divided by 27/62.5, but as a fraction, 54/125 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by GCD(54,125)=1, so it remains 54/125=0.432.

Alternatively, write as 6750/15625= divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270/625, then divide by 5: 54/125.

Thus, the exact ratio is 54/125, which is 0.432. Therefore, the answer is 54/125 or 0.432, but since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, even though the factor is less than 1, it's still the correct answer.

Hence, boxed answer: \boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}} or \boxed{0.432}

But the problem might expect a fractional form. 54/125 simplifies to 54/125. Alternatively, decimal is 0.432. Since 54/125 reduces to 54/125, which is 0.432.

But perhaps in the problem's solution, it's 27/64, but I get 54/125≈0.432.

But my SI unit calculation gave≈0.255 vs≈0.591, ratio≈0.432. Therefore, the answer is 54/125 or 0.432.

So the answer should be boxed as \boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}} or \boxed{0.432}. Since the problem might expect a fraction, 54/125 is the exact value.

54 divided by 125: 54/125=0.432. Yes.

Therefore, the answer is 54/125, which is system_1 being 54/125 times the mass of system_2.

**Final Answer**
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is \boxed{\dfrac{54}{125}}.
