To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ total volume using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid at 25°C, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃**:
   - Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 106.874 g/mol
   - Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol

2. **Determine stoichiometric H⁺ required**:
   - Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ for neutralization.
   - Moles of H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009356 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol

3. **Calculate volume of 0.1 M acid needed**:
   - Volume = moles / concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.02807 dm³ = 28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³

4. **Determine the pH of the resulting solution**:
   - Fe³⁺ undergoes hydrolysis: Fe³⁺ + H₂O ↔ Fe(OH)²⁺ + H⁺
   - Using the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ (≈ 2.79×10⁻³⁹) and solving for [H⁺]:
     \[
     \text{[H⁺]}^3 = \frac{\text{[Fe³⁺]} \cdot K_w^3}{K_{sp}}
     \]
   -  [Fe³⁺] = 0.009356 M, Ksp = 2.79×10⁻³⁹, Kw = 1×10⁻¹⁴
   - Solving gives [H⁺] ≈ 0.01496 M, corresponding to a pH of ≈ 1.83

### Final Answer
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{1.83}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution at 25°C. Also, I have to find the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, which is typically insoluble in water. But if we add an acid, it should react with the hydroxide ions, dissolving the solid. Since it's a strong monobasic acid, like HCl or HNO3, the reaction should be straightforward. 

The general reaction for a metal hydroxide reacting with a strong acid (HA) would be:

Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3HA (aq) → Fe³+ (aq) + 3A⁻ (aq) + 3H2O (l)

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HA to dissolve completely. That gives me a stoichiometric ratio of 1:3 between Fe(OH)3 and the acid.

Next, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are in 0.1 grams. To do that, I need the molar mass of Fe(OH)3.

Iron (Fe) has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16.00 g/mol, and Hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol. So for Fe(OH)3:

Molar mass = 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Each OH group is O (16.00) and H (1.008), so each is 17.008 g/mol. Three OH groups would be 3*17.008 = 51.024 g/mol. Adding Fe: 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol. Yeah, that seems correct.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol, which is approximately 9.356×10^-4 mol.

Given the stoichiometry, the moles of HA needed would be 3 times that: 3 * 9.356×10^-4 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

Since the acid concentration is 0.1 M, the volume required would be moles / concentration. So, 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.02807 dm³, which is 28.07 cm³. But wait, is that all?

Hold on, I need to make sure that all of the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved. But maybe after adding the acid, the solution might still have some Fe^3+ which can hydrolyze, potentially affecting the solubility. Hmm. The problem mentions dissolving Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume, so perhaps after adding some volume V of acid, the total volume is made up to 100 cm³ with water. But the way the problem is phrased, we might need to consider that the acid itself is part of the total volume. Wait, the question says "0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution" which is 100 cm³ total volume. Hmm, so is the acid added first, then diluted to 100 cm³? Or is the total volume 100 cm³, so the volume of acid added plus water equals 100 cm³? The wording isn't completely clear, but since standard solutions are made by diluting to the final volume, I think the total volume after adding acid and water is 100 cm³.

But maybe another approach: The problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So we need to calculate the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required such that when mixed with water to make 100 cm³ solution, the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved. But wait, when we dissolve Fe(OH)3 using acid, the Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+ ions from the acid. If the solution is then diluted to 100 cm³, but the key is having enough H+ to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3.

Alternatively, maybe the dissolution occurs in the 100 cm³ solution, so the total volume is 100 cm³, which includes the volume of acid added and any water. So, to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³, we need to add a volume V of 0.1 M acid such that when diluted to 100 cm³, the H+ concentration is enough to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. Hmm, but I might need to consider the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 here to check if, after adding the acid, the solution is undersaturated so that all the Fe(OH)3 dissolves.

Wait a second. Typically, dissolution of a metal hydroxide with a strong acid is a neutralization reaction. So in the presence of excess H+ ions, the Fe(OH)3 will dissolve completely. Unless there's a point where even after the stoichiometric amount is added, the pH isn't low enough to prevent precipitation. Maybe after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the resulting Fe^3+ can hydrolyze water, increasing acidity. But I think in the case of a strong acid, once you add sufficient acid to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3 and keep the solution acidic, the Fe^3+ will remain in solution.

But does the dissolution require just stoichiometric amounts of H+ to react with the OH- in Fe(OH)3, or do we need excess H+ to shift the solubility equilibrium?

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid and we are adding acid to consume the OH- groups, the stoichiometry should be 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but maybe if I only add the stoichiometric amount, after dissolving, the solution could be saturated with Fe(OH)3. However, Fe(OH)3 has low solubility, so unless there's excess acid, it might precipitate again. Wait, but in the presence of a strong acid, the solution pH would be low enough to keep Fe^3+ in solution. Because Fe^3+ tends to hydrolyze in water to produce H+, but in a strongly acidic solution, that's suppressed.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal volume of acid needed is just the stoichiometric amount to neutralize the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3. Then, once dissolved, the pH of the solution will be determined by the excess H+ ions left over. Hmm, but wait, when the acid is a strong acid, like HCl, adding the stoichiometric amount would convert all Fe(OH)3 into Fe^3+ and Cl- (if HCl is the acid), but the solution would also have H+ from the dissociation of Fe^3+?

Hold on, maybe there's a catch here. Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and undergoes hydrolysis in water:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3H+ 

This reaction releases H+ ions. Therefore, even after stoichiometrically adding the H+ to neutralize the hydroxide from Fe(OH)3, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ would produce additional H+. But in the initial dissolution, the H+ required is the 3 H+ per Fe(OH)3. But if Fe^3+ is present, it hydrolyzes, producing H+ which would lower the pH. However, if enough acid is added to not only neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3 but also to suppress the hydrolysis of Fe^3+, ensuring that the solution remains clear without precipitation.

But perhaps, since we need to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3, the first step is to use stoichiometry to find the amount of H+ required. Then, considering the hydrolysis, we may need additional H+ to keep the pH low enough to prevent precipitation. So, the minimal amount of acid would be the stoichiometric amount plus enough to account for the hydrolysis. However, the problem says "minimum volume" of acid needed, so probably assuming that the stoichiometric amount is sufficient because after that, even if Fe^3+ hydrolyses, H+ ions are produced which will further lower pH. But because we use a strong acid, the solution would have a very low pH, so maybe the stoichiometric amount is enough.

Wait, but maybe not. Suppose we add just stoichiometric acid. Then the Fe^3+ would hydrolyze, generate H+, but since solution is in 100 cm³, the generated H+ might not affect the dissolution because once Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, the Fe^3+ would stay in solution since we already added enough H+ to initially dissociate it, and the additional H+ from hydrolysis just contributes to pH. Hence, the stoichiometric amount is enough. Therefore, the minimal volume is stoichiometric.

Therefore, my initial calculation was 28.07 cm³. But let me cross-check this.

First, calculate moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.

Moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.0009356 = 0.002807 mol.

Concentration of H+ provided by the acid: 0.1 M.

So volume = moles / concentration = 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. So approximately 28.1 cm³.

But wait, the total volume is 100 cm³. So after adding 28.07 cm³ of acid, we add water up to 100 cm³. However, the concentration of H+ will be affected by both the acid added and the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But since the problem asks for the minimum volume of acid required, which is before dilution. Wait, no—it says "to prepare the solution"—if preparing the solution, you would mix the acid with Fe(OH)3 and then dilute to 100 cm³, or is the acid part of the 100 cm³? This is crucial.

Looking back: "...dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution..."

So the 100 cm³ total volume includes the acid added. Therefore, we need to calculate the volume V of acid such that when mixed with water to make 100 cm³, there is sufficient H+ to dissolve the 0.1 g Fe(OH)3.

But wait, how does dissolving work here? If the acid is diluted to 100 cm³, the concentration of H+ would be lower. So maybe the stoichiometric amount is not enough because the H+ concentration in 100 cm³ might be insufficient to dissolve the Fe(OH)3.

But now I need to think in terms of solubility equilibrium. The dissolution reaction:

Fe(OH)3 (s) ↔ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH⁻ (aq)

But since we are adding acid (H+), which reacts with OH-:

H+ + OH- ↔ H2O (l)

So combining both, the overall reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3H+ ↔ Fe^3+ + 3H2O (l)

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [Fe^3+]/([H+]^3) because the concentration of H2O is constant and incorporated into K.

But the equilibrium constant K can be related to the solubility product Ksp of Fe(OH)3 and the inverse of the ion product of water (1/Kw^3). So:

K = Ksp / Kw^3

Where Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is the solubility product. Let me recall, the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 at 25°C. I need to check exact value, but for triiron trihydroxide, different sources might have different values. Perhaps about 6.3×10^-38? Or other values. Wait, actually, Fe(OH)3 is more accurately represented as FeO(OH)·H2O or with varying degrees of hydration, but maybe for simplicity in general chemistry, Ksp is given. I need to confirm.

Alternatively, we can use Ksp for Fe(OH)3. Let's suppose Ksp is around 1×10^-39, but this is uncertain. Wait, upon checking (though I can't actually look it up currently), but I know that Fe(OH)3 is very insoluble. If I remember correctly, the Ksp is about 2.79×10^-39 at 25°C. But maybe I should use the common value provided in textbooks.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that adding stoichiometric amount of acid is sufficient, and ignore the solubility product because the acid provides enough H+ to shift the equilibrium completely to dissolution. If that's the case, then my initial stoichiometric approach is sufficient.

But given that the problem specifies dissolving the Fe(OH)3 in the acid solution, and given Fe(OH)3's extremely low solubility, perhaps the dissolution reaction requires more than just stoichiometric H+ because even after neutralizing the OH- from Fe(OH)3, if the solution has some Fe^3+ present, the solubility product must be satisfied.

Wait, going back to the problem. If we add enough acid to react stoichiometrically with Fe(OH)3, then:

Moles of Fe^3+ produced = 0.0009356 mol.

The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.

Thus, [Fe^3+] = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M ≈ 0.00936 M.

Then, to prevent precipitation of Fe(OH)3, the product [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 must be less than Ksp.

Assuming we have added sufficient H+ to dissolve Fe(OH)3, but after dissolution, the Fe^3+ is in solution and may hydrolyze to produce H+ and OH-.

However, if the solution is strongly acidic, [OH-] is very low, so even with a high [Fe^3+], the product [Fe^3+][OH-]^3 would be less than Ksp, so no precipitation occurs.

Thus, it's necessary to compute the maximum [OH-] that can exist without precipitation, and then compute the corresponding pH.

Alternatively, compute the pH required to keep the solution undersaturated with respect to Fe(OH)3.

But how?

Given [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M,

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

Solve for [OH-]:

[OH^-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+])^(1/3).

However, the exact value of Ksp is needed. Since the problem doesn't provide it, perhaps the problem expects only the stoichiometric calculation, assuming that Ksp is very small, and once enough acid is added to react with Fe(OH)3, the remaining H+ from the acid and the Fe^3+ hydrolysis makes the solution sufficiently acidic, so precipitation doesn't occur.

But given that the question asks for pH of the resulting solution, perhaps we need to calculate the pH considering both the excess acid (if any) and the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, if we add stoichiometric amounts of H+, then the solution will have 0.0009356 mol Fe^3+ in 0.1 L (0.009356 M), and the amount of H+ from the acid is 3*0.0009356 = 0.002807 mol. But since all the H+ is consumed in reacting with Fe(OH)3, the H+ in solution comes from the dissociation of Fe^3+.

Wait no. When you add strong acid (like HCl), it dissociates completely. The H+ from the acid will react with Fe(OH)3:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

If we add exactly 3 moles H+ per mole Fe(OH)3, then all the H+ is consumed in the reaction, resulting in Fe^3+ and water. So, the only H+ left comes from the ionization of water and hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But in reality, Fe^3+ is a strong Lewis acid and will hydrolyze:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

Each Fe^3+ ion can produce H+ ions through hydrolysis. The extent of hydrolysis depends on the concentration of Fe^3+ and the hydrolysis constant.

But since the problem mentions a monobasic strong acid, which we’ll refer to as HA, then the reaction will produce A^- anions. If the acid is strong, A^- is a weak base (since its conjugate acid is strong). However, generally, if the acid is like HCl, then Cl^- is a spectator ion and doesn't hydrolyze. But Fe^3+ hydrolysis would still generate H+.

Therefore, in the solution after dissolution, the Fe^3+ would hydrolyze, producing H+:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ 

Therefore, the solution should be acidic due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But then again, after the stoichiometric addition of H+, there won't be excess H+ from the acid; instead, any H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Therefore, the pH would depend on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So, in this case, first, considering only stoichiometric H+ required, and then pH determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

However, this brings us back to potentially having undissolved Fe(OH)3 because if the solution does not have a low enough pH, the solubility product may be exceeded. Therefore, perhaps even after stoichiometric H+ is added, we need some excess H+ to ensure that Fe(OH)3 does not re-precipitate.

Therefore, to calculate the minimal amount of acid required, we need to:

1. Neutralize the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3 (stoichiometric H+).
2. Provide sufficient H+ to keep the solution acidic enough so that [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 < Ksp.

So, if [Fe^3+] is fixed (from dissolving the Fe(OH)3), then solving for [OH^-] gives the maximum allowable [OH^-] before precipitation. Then convert that [OH^-] to pH and find the required [H+] from acid to maintain pH below that value.

But without the value of Ksp, how to proceed? The problem probably expects you to ignore the solubility product and assume that adding the stoichiometric amount is sufficient. However, a complete answer would account for the solubility product, but maybe the problem provides Ksp indirectly or expects us to recall a general value.

Alternatively, perhaps have the following approach:

The acid must provide enough H+ not only to react with Fe(OH)3 but also to supply H+ to keep the solution acidic enough to dissolve all Fe(OH)3. Therefore, two parts:

1. Stoichiometric requirement.
2. Requirement based on solubility.

But since only stoichiometric amount is the starting point, and unless told to consider the solubility product, maybe that’s enough.

However, looking at the final pH question, if we are supposed to compute it considering Fe^3+ hydrolysis, which in turn depends on the concentration of Fe^3+.

Therefore, the steps could be as follows:

1. Calculate moles of Fe(OH)3.
2. Calculate moles of H+ required for neutralization (3:1 ratio).
3. Calculate volume of 0.1 M acid needed for the H+ from step 2.
4. Determine the concentration of Fe^3+ in 100 cm³.
5. Calculate the pH based on Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Therefore, proceeding with that approach as perhaps the problem doesn't require involving Ksp, or maybe suggests that once the stoichiometric acid is added, the solution is acidic enough. However, it would be better to account for Ksp.

But given typical problems like this in textbooks, maybe the expected answer is just stoichiometric volume, and then pH calculated from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Alright, let's proceed step by step.

First step:

Moles Fe(OH)3: 0.1g / 106.874 g/mol = approximately 0.0009356 mol.

Moles H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009356 = 0.0028068 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.028068 dm³ = 28.068 cm³ ≈ 28.07 cm³. So, the minimum volume is ~28.1 cm³.

However, given that Fe^3+ will hydrolyze, generating H+:

The resulting solution will have Fe^3+ concentration:

[Fe^3+] = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.

Fe^3+ hydrolysis reaction:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ 

The hydrolysis can be represented as:

Fe(H2O)_6^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(H2O)_5(OH)^2+ + H3O+

The equilibrium expression for the first hydrolysis step is:

K1 = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+]/[Fe^3+]

The hydrolysis constant (K1) for Fe^3+ is approximately 6.7×10^-3 at 25°C. (This is a value I recall; however, different sources might vary.)

But to calculate pH, we can assume that each Fe^3+ ion contributes one H+ ion. However, considering the possibility of multiple hydrolysis steps, but for a rough estimate, considering the first hydrolysis step.

However, given the complexity and possible variations, maybe in the problem's context, a simplification is acceptable.

Assuming that Fe^3+ undergoes hydrolysis as:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ 

Which, overall, generates 3 H+ per Fe^3+.

But actually, hydrolysis is stepwise, with each step producing one H+.

However, maybe we can calculate the pH contributed by Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Assuming that the concentration of H+ comes largely from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Let's denote the concentration of Fe^3+ as 0.009356 M. Let K_h be the hydrolysis constant.

If we take K_h as approximately 6.7×10^-3 for Fe^3+ (this is actually the K1 for the first hydrolysis step), then:

For each Fe^3+ ion,

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ 

K1 = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+]/[Fe^3+] ≈ 6.7×10^-3

Let’s assume that hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is x, then:

[H+] = x
[Fe(OH)^2+] ≈ x
[Fe^3+] ≈ 0.009356 - x ≈ 0.009356 (since x will be small compared to 0.009356)

Then:

K1 ≈ x² / 0.009356 ≈ 6.7×10^-3

Solving for x:

x² = 6.7×10^-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 6.7×0.009356 * 10^-3 ≈ 0.0627 * 10^-3 ≈ 6.27×10^-5

x ≈ sqrt(6.27×10^-5) ≈ 7.92×10^-3 M

So [H+] ≈ 7.92×10^-3 M → pH ≈ -log(7.92×10^-3) ≈ 2.10

However, this result contradicts the idea that stronger hydrolysis would produce a low pH. But checking:

Wait, Fe^3+ is a strong hydrolyzing ion. If [H+] is 7.92×10^-3, pH ~ 2.1, which is very acidic. However, this [H+] is approximately 0.0079 M. If the only source of H+ is hydrolysis, then this is correct.

But note that, in the solution after dissolution, the only source of H+ is from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. There is no excess strong acid. Therefore, the solution would have a pH around 2.1.

Is this feasible? Given that Fe^3+ is a strong acid, yes. But the K1 value I used may not be accurate, which could alter the result.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects to approximate the pH by simply considering that Fe^3+ is a strong enough acid to fully dissociate three H+ ions. However, this isn't the case because even though Fe^3+ can hydrolysis, it does so progressively, each step with a lower K value.

But if we assume that each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+, then:

[H+] = 3 * 0.009356 ≈ 0.02807 M → pH ≈ 1.55

But this overestimates the acidity since hydrolysis isn't complete.

Alternatively, since the problem says "monobasic strong acid", we can model the solution as the acid providing H+ which reacts with Fe(OH)3, then the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes:

After dissolution, the H+ in solution comes from two sources:

1. Excess H+ from the acid (if beyond stoichiometric amount).
2. H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But if the stoichiometric acid is exactly added, there's no excess H+; all H+ is used up to neutralize the OH- in Fe(OH)3, yielding Fe^3+ and water. Then the only H+ in solution is from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Which would lead to [H+] ~ sqrt(K1 * [Fe^3+])), though exact calculation needed.

Alternatively, given that the hydrolysis produces H+, maybe we can set up an ICE table:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ FeOH^2+ + H+ 

Initial: 0.009356 M, 0, 0 (assuming H+ from neutral water is negligible)
Change: -x, +x, +x
Equilibrium: 0.009356 - x, x, x

Using K1 = 6.7×10^-3 ≈ x² / (0.009356 - x)

Assuming x << 0.009356, so it's approx x² / 0.009356 = 6.7×10^-3

Therefore, x² ≈ 6.7×10^-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 6.27×10^-5

So x ≈ 7.92×10^-3 M. But wait, x is 0.00792 M, which is ~84% of the original concentration 0.009356 M? That's a significant fraction, so assuming x is small may not be valid.

Therefore, need to solve quadratic equation:

x² = 6.7×10^-3 * (0.009356 - x)

=> x² + 6.7×10^-3 x - 6.7×10^-3*0.009356 = 0

That's x² + 0.0067 x - (6.7*0.009356)*10^-5 ≈ ?

Calculating 6.7 * 0.009356 ≈ 0.06263

Thus, equation: x² + 0.0067 x - 0.06263×10^-4 = 0

Wait, wait-- let me make sure. Let me compute:

Original equation:

x² = K1*( [Fe^3+] - x )

=> x² = 6.7e-3*(0.009356 - x)

=> x² = 6.7e-3*0.009356 - 6.7e-3 x

=> x² + 6.7e-3 x - (6.7e-3*0.009356) = 0

Compute 6.7e-3 * 0.009356:

6.7 * 0.009356 = approximately:

6.7 * 0.01 = 0.067; subtract 6.7 * 0.000644 ≈ 0.00431

So 0.067 - 0.00431 ≈ 0.06269

Therefore, the constant term is - 0.06269e-3 = -6.269e-5.

So, equation: x² + 0.0067x - 6.269e-5 = 0.

Solving via quadratic formula:

x = [-0.0067 ± sqrt((0.0067)^2 +4*1*6.269e-5)] / 2

Compute discriminant:

(0.0067)^2 = 0.00004489

4 * 6.269e-5 = 0.00025076

Total discriminant = 0.00004489 + 0.00025076 ≈ 0.00029565

sqrt(0.00029565) ≈ 0.017196

Thus, x = [ -0.0067 + 0.017196 ] / 2 ≈ (0.010496 ) / 2 ≈ 0.005248 M.

Therefore, [H+] = x ≈ 0.005248 M, pH ≈ -log(0.005248) ≈ 2.28.

So pH ~2.28.

But K1 might differ. If, for example, K1 is different, the pH changes. However, if we take a general hydrolysis in the problem and the given data doesn't include Ksp or hydrolysis constants, perhaps the expected answer is this pH calculated assuming some approximate hydrolysis. Alternatively, maybe the problem ignores hydrolysis and says that because Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in acid and the solution is neutral, prompting a vague logical jump.

Wait, but the question asks for the pH of the resulting solution. If the acid is a strong monobasic acid and we added just the stoichiometric amount required for Fe(OH)3, then all H+ from the acid would be consumed in neutralizing the OH- from Fe(OH)3, as per:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Therefore, the solution would contain Fe^3+ and the conjugate base of the strong acid (eg, Cl- if HCl). Fe^3+ then hydrolyzes to produce H+, making the solution acidic. So even after neutralizing, pH is determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

However, in some problems where the acid is in excess, the pH is calculated based on excess H+ concentration. If no excess acid is added, in this case, without any excess H+, the pH is governed solely by Fe^3+ hydrolysis, which we approximated yielding pH ~2.28.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that upon dissolving, Fe(OH)3 becomes Fe^3+ which then is a strong acid such that each mole of Fe^3+ releases 3 moles of H+? But that's an oversimplification. Fe^3+ hydrolysis only partially releases H+.

Wait, maybe the total H+ from hydrolysis is approximated via the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( K1 * C )

Where C is the concentration of Fe^3+.

If K1 is 6.7e-3 and C = 0.009356 M,

[H+] = sqrt(6.7e-3 * 0.009356) ≈ sqrt(6.7*0.009356e-3*1e-0) → Let me compute:

6.7e-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 6.7 * 0.009356 ≈ 0.0627; multiply by 1e-3: 0.0627e-3 = 6.27e-5

sqrt(6.27e-5) ≈ 0.00792 M, so pH ≈ 2.10. But our quadratic when C=0.009356 gave ≈0.00525 M H+ leading to pH=2.28.

But without knowing the exact K1, how is this problem solvable? If the answer expects using Ksp for Fe(OH)3, then we have different steps. Let's explore that approach.

Alternate approach:

First, determine how much acid is needed to get the Fe^3+ into solution, considering solubility product.

Reaction:

Fe(OH)3 (s) ↔ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH⁻ (aq)

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3

To dissolve Fe(OH)3, adding H+ will remove OH-:

H+ + OH- → H2O

Therefore, the dissolution is facilitated by removing OH- through acid addition.

In order to dissolve 0.0009356 mol of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 L, [Fe^3+] must be 0.009356 M.

The minimum [H+] required to keep Fe(OH)3 dissolved is determined by keeping [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 < Ksp. But [OH^-] = Kw/[H+], so:

Ksp = [Fe^3+]*(Kw/[H+})^3

Rearranged:

[H+]^3 = [Fe^3+]*Kw^3 / Ksp

→ [H+] = cube root( [Fe^3+]*Kw^3 / Ksp )

Then, taking logarithms, pH can be calculated.

But to do this, we need Ksp. The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 2.79×10^-39 at 25°C. Let's use this value.

Kw = 1e-14.

[H+]^3 = (0.009356) * (1e-14)^3 / (2.79e-39)

First calculate the denominator: 2.79e-39

Numerator: 0.009356 * (1e-14)^3 = 0.009356 * 1e-42 = 9.356e-45

[H+]^3 = 9.356e-45 / 2.79e-39 ≈ 3.355e-06

Therefore, [H+] = (3.355e-06)^(1/3) ≈ 1.496e-2 M

So pH = -log(1.496e-2) ≈ 1.825

Thus, the required [H+] is ~0.01496 M, which corresponds to pH ~1.83.

Therefore, the total moles of H+ required would be:

From stoichiometry (3:1) + the excess H+ to keep pH at 1.83.

But wait, this approach now complicates things further because in reality, adding acid both neutralizes the OH- from Fe(OH)3 and provides the H+ necessary to suppress the solubility.

Wait, I think the correct approach is combining both the stoichiometry and the equilibrium.

The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 involves the reaction:

Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3H+ ↔ Fe^3+ + 3H2O (l)

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [Fe^3+]/[H+]^3 = Ksp / Kw^3

Hence, K = Ksp / Kw^3.

According to the value Ksp=2.79e-39, then:

K = 2.79e-39 / (1e-14)^3 = 2.79e-39 / 1e-42 = 2.79e3 = 2790.

Therefore, K is relatively large, meaning the reaction goes to completion; hence, dissolving Fe(OH)3 in acid requires sufficient H+ to shift the equilibrium to the right. Since the problem states "minimum volume" of acid to dissolve 0.1 grams, we therefore only need the stoichiometric amount (3:1) and doesint require excess. But this认为，尽管平衡常数很大，只要加入足够的酸使反应向右进行就行。实际上，可能不需要额外的考虑，因為平衡常数很大意味著反应极右，所以化学计量的酸已足够。

However, with K=2790:

If K is very large, then the reaction will go to completion. Therefore, to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3, we need at least stoichiometric H+ (3:1). Therefore, in that case, my original answer of ~28 mL is correct. Then, calculate the pH due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Perhaps then, the correct steps are:

1. Compute the moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol.

2. H+ needed stoichiometrically: 3 * 0.0009356 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

3. Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M ≈ 0.02807 L ≈ 28.07 cm³.

4. After dissolution, solution is 100 cm³.

5. Moles of Fe^3+: 0.0009356 mol. [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.009356 M.

6. Compute pH due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But without Ksp or hydrolysis constants, we'd have to approximate. However, given the problem's context, maybe the pH is calculated based on just the stoichiometry. But in a real situation, we must use hydrolysis constants.

Given that earlier calculations with Ksp gave pH ~1.83 due to需要保持溶解的[H+], the alternate step would be discerning the total H+ needed, including both stoichiometric and the amount implied by [H+]=0.01496 M in the solution认为总体的H+需要满足形态和积累两方面：

However, think about total:

Total n(H+) required = n(H+)_stoichiometric + n(H+)_excess_to_maintain_pH

Wait,这可能是两个不同的概念。但这种情况IEI墙，这个过程实际上加入了酸，提供了H+使反应向右进行，因此我们需要添加足够的H+既有中和三氢氧化铁中的的羟基离子，又提供足够的[H+]来抑制形成沉淀根据 Ksp。

这没有意义因为一旦用化学计量的酸中和，所有Fe(OH)3溶解转化为Fe^3+水解决方案中，并且此时，H+来自于Fe^3+的水解，而如果你希望这个溶解，你必须保持[H+]足够高以符合条件的解鸭的铁离子浓度是否需要更多的酸。

但是，该方法应该是同时允许足够的酸添加：不仅将化学计量中和，但要保持足够的额外酸来维持[H+]足够低（pH足够低）使得Q= [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3<Ksp。

但或许问题并不预期如此深入的思考，仅仅需要化学计量的酸量。如果是这样的话，then的minimum volume是28.07cm³，和pH来源于Fe^3+水解必定在2左右。

考虑到这个问题可能存在层级，作为学生练习可能需要考虑简单化，因而很有可能 the required answer for the volume is 28.1 cm³, and pH大约2.1.


**Final Answer**
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{1.83}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution at 25°C. Also, I have to find the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, which is typically insoluble in water. But if we add an acid, it should react with the hydroxide ions, dissolving the solid. Since it's a strong monobasic acid, like HCl or HNO3, the reaction should be straightforward. 

The general reaction for a metal hydroxide reacting with a strong acid (HA) would be:

Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3HA (aq) → Fe³+ (aq) + 3A⁻ (aq) + 3H2O (l)

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HA to dissolve completely. That gives me a stoichiometric ratio of 1:3 between Fe(OH)3 and the acid.

Next, I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are in 0.1 grams. To do that, I need the molar mass of Fe(OH)3.

Iron (Fe) has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16.00 g/mol, and Hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol. So for Fe(OH)3:

Molar mass = 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Each OH group is O (16.00) and H (1.008), so each is 17.008 g/mol. Three OH groups would be 3*17.008 = 51.024 g/mol. Adding Fe: 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol. Yeah, that seems correct.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol, which is approximately 9.356×10^-4 mol.

Given the stoichiometry, the moles of HA needed would be 3 times that: 3 * 9.356×10^-4 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

Since the acid concentration is 0.1 M, the volume required would be moles / concentration. So, 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.02807 dm³, which is 28.07 cm³. But wait, is that all?

Hold on, I need to make sure that all of the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved. But maybe after adding the acid, the solution might still have some Fe^3+ which can hydrolyze, potentially affecting the solubility. Hmm. The problem mentions dissolving Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume, so perhaps after adding some volume V of acid, the total volume is made up to 100 cm³ with water. But the way the problem is phrased, we might need to consider that the acid itself is part of the total volume. Wait, the question says "0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution" which is 100 cm³ total volume. Hmm, so is the acid added first, then diluted to 100 cm³? Or is the total volume 100 cm³, so the volume of acid added plus water equals 100 cm³? The wording isn't completely clear, but since standard solutions are made by diluting to the final volume, I think the total volume after adding acid and water is 100 cm³.

But maybe another approach: The problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So we need to calculate the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required such that when mixed with water to make 100 cm³ solution, the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved. But wait, when we dissolve Fe(OH)3 using acid, the Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+ ions from the acid. If the solution is then diluted to 100 cm³, but the key is having enough H+ to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3.

Alternatively, maybe the dissolution occurs in the 100 cm³ solution, so the total volume is 100 cm³, which includes the volume of acid added and any water. So, to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³, we need to add a volume V of 0.1 M acid such that when diluted to 100 cm³, the H+ concentration is enough to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. Hmm, but I might need to consider the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 here to check if, after adding the acid, the solution is undersaturated so that all the Fe(OH)3 dissolves.

Wait a second. Typically, dissolution of a metal hydroxide with a strong acid is a neutralization reaction. So in the presence of excess H+ ions, the Fe(OH)3 will dissolve completely. Unless there's a point where even after the stoichiometric amount is added, the pH isn't low enough to prevent precipitation. Maybe after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the resulting Fe^3+ can hydrolyze water, increasing acidity. But I think in the case of a strong acid, once you add sufficient acid to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3 and keep the solution acidic, the Fe^3+ will remain in solution.

But does the dissolution require just stoichiometric amounts of H+ to react with the OH- in Fe(OH)3, or do we need excess H+ to shift the solubility equilibrium?

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid and we are adding acid to consume the OH- groups, the stoichiometry should be 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but maybe if I only add the stoichiometric amount, after dissolving, the solution could be saturated with Fe(OH)3. However, Fe(OH)3 has low solubility, so unless there's excess acid, it might precipitate again. Wait, but in the presence of a strong acid, the solution pH would be low enough to keep Fe^3+ in solution. Because Fe^3+ tends to hydrolyze in water to produce H+, but in a strongly acidic solution, that's suppressed.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal volume of acid needed is just the stoichiometric amount to neutralize the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3. Then, once dissolved, the pH of the solution will be determined by the excess H+ ions left over. Hmm, but wait, when the acid is a strong acid, like HCl, adding the stoichiometric amount would convert all Fe(OH)3 into Fe^3+ and Cl- (if HCl is the acid), but the solution would also have H+ from the dissociation of Fe^3+?

Hold on, maybe there's a catch here. Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and undergoes hydrolysis in water:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3H+ 

This reaction releases H+ ions. Therefore, even after stoichiometrically adding the H+ to neutralize the hydroxide from Fe(OH)3, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ would produce additional H+. But in the initial dissolution, the H+ required is the 3 H+ per Fe(OH)3. But if Fe^3+ is present, it hydrolyzes, producing H+ which would lower the pH. However, if enough acid is added to not only neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3 but also to suppress the hydrolysis of Fe^3+, ensuring that the solution remains clear without precipitation.

But perhaps, since we need to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3, the first step is to use stoichiometry to find the amount of H+ required. Then, considering the hydrolysis, we may need additional H+ to keep the pH low enough to prevent precipitation. So, the minimal amount of acid would be the stoichiometric amount plus enough to account for the hydrolysis. However, the problem says "minimum volume" of acid needed, so probably assuming that the stoichiometric amount is sufficient because after that, even if Fe^3+ hydrolyses, H+ ions are produced which will further lower pH. But because we use a strong acid, the solution would have a very low pH, so maybe the stoichiometric amount is enough.

Wait, but maybe not. Suppose we add just stoichiometric acid. Then the Fe^3+ would hydrolyze, generate H+, but since solution is in 100 cm³, the generated H+ might not affect the dissolution because once Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, the Fe^3+ would stay in solution since we already added enough

So, we're tasked with determining the minimum volume of 0.1 M strong monobasic acid necessary to completely dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in a 100 cm³ solution at 25°C, and then finding the resulting solution's pH. It's a complex problem that requires careful consideration of the chemical reactions and equilibria involved. 

First, let's consider the reaction between Fe(OH)3, a typically water-insoluble metal hydroxide, and a strong acid (HA). The reaction should consume the hydroxide ions, thereby dissolving the solid. The general reaction equation would be:

Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3HA (aq) → Fe³+ (aq) + 3A⁻ (aq) + 3H2O (l)

This indicates a 1:3 stoichiometric ratio between Fe(OH)3 and the acid.

To calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 grams, we need its molar mass. Given the molar masses of Fe (55.85 g/mol), O (16.00 g/mol), and H (1.008 g/mol), the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is:

55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol

Thus, 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 9.356×10^-4 mol. Stoichiometrically, this requires 3 times as many moles of HA: 3 * 9.356×10^-4 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

At 0.1 M acid concentration, the volume needed would be moles divided by concentration: 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.02807 dm³ = 28.07 cm³.

However, we must ensure complete dissolution of Fe(OH)3. The presence of Fe^3+ ions could lead to hydrolysis, potentially affecting solubility. The problem statement suggests that the acid is added first, then diluted to 100 cm³ total volume with water. So, we need to find the minimum acid volume such that, when mixed with water to make a 100 cm³ solution, all the Fe(OH)3 dissolves.

Alternatively, the dissolution might occur directly in the 100 cm³ solution, which includes both the added acid volume and water. In this case, we must add a volume V of 0.1 M acid such that, when diluted to 100 cm³, the H+ concentration suffices to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. This might require considering the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 to verify that the solution is undersaturated after adding the acid.

Typically, dissolving a metal hydroxide with a strong acid is a neutralization reaction. With excess H+ ions, the Fe(OH)3 should dissolve completely. However, there could be a point where, even after adding the stoichiometric amount, the pH isn't low enough to prevent precipitation. The resulting Fe^3+ might hydrolyze water, increasing acidity. But with a strong acid, once enough is added to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3 and maintain an acidic solution, the Fe^3+ should remain dissolved.

The dissolution might require just stoichiometric amounts of H+ to react with the OH- in Fe(OH)3, or excess H+ might be needed to shift the solubility equilibrium. Since Fe(OH)3 has low solubility, without excess acid, it could precipitate again. But in a strongly acidic solution from a strong acid, the low pH should keep Fe^3+ dissolved by suppressing its hydrolysis.

Therefore, the minimal acid volume is likely just the stoichiometric amount to neutralize the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3. The solution's pH will then be determined by any excess H+ ions. However, when the Fe(OH)3 dissolves, the resulting Fe^3+ undergoes hydrolysis in water:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3H+ 

This releases additional H+ ions. So, even after stoichiometrically neutralizing the hydroxide, Fe^3+ hydrolysis would produce more H+. To dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3, we first find the stoichiometric H+ amount. Then, considering hydrolysis, additional H+ may be needed to keep the pH low enough to prevent precipitation. The minimal acid amount would be the stoichiometric amount plus enough to account for hydrolysis.

However, the problem specifies the "minimum volume" of acid, so we might assume the stoichiometric amount suffices because, even if Fe^3+ hydrolyses afterwards, the produced H+ will further lower pH. With a strong acid, the very low pH solution would likely prevent Fe(OH)3 precipitation.

But perhaps not. If we add just stoichiometric acid and the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes, the generated H+ might not affect dissolution because, once Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, Fe^3+ would stay in solution since we added enough acid initially.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid necessary to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution at 25°C. I also need to calculate the pH of the resulting solution. Let's tackle this problem step-by-step.

Firstly, since Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, it's generally insoluble in water. However, by adding a strong acid, the acid will react with the hydroxide ions and dissolve it. As we're dealing with a strong monobasic acid like HCl or HNO3, the reaction should proceed easily.

The reaction of a metal hydroxide with a strong acid (HA) can be written as:

Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3HA (aq) → Fe³+ (aq) + 3A⁻ (aq) + 3H2O (l)

This indicates a stoichiometric ratio of 1:3 between Fe(OH)3 and the acid.

To find the quantity of Fe(OH)3 in moles, I need its molar mass:

Iron (Fe) has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is around 16.00 g/mol, and hydrogen is roughly 1.008 g/mol. Therefore, for Fe(OH)3:

Molar mass = 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol

Convert 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 to moles:

Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol or 9.356×10^-4 mol

With the stoichiometric ratio established, the moles of HA needed are three times that of Fe(OH)3:

3 * 9.356×10^-4 ≈ 0.002807 mol

With the acid solution being 0.1 M, the required volume becomes moles divided by concentration:

0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.02807 dm³, which equates to 28.07 cm³.

Now, regarding the total volume of 100 cm³, it seems like we need the acid volume, plus enough water to make up to 100 cm³. So, after adding the acid, water makes up the rest to keep the total 100 cm³.

Once the acid is added, it reacts with the hydroxide ions from the Fe(OH)3, and if the acid is in excess, no hydroxide should remain to precipitate back into a solid. The Fe^3+ produced can hydrolyze, but given the strong acidity, the pH will remain low enough to keep the iron ions in solution.

Thus, the minimum volume of acid needed is the calculated stoichiometric amount. This should dissolve the Fe(OH)3 completely, and as the strong acid maintains a low pH, the resulting solution won't allow for precipitation.

Finally, the resulting pH will depend on the excess H+ ions in the solution post-reaction, and in the presence of a strong acid, the solution will maintain a low pH, keeping the iron in solution.

H+ in stoichiometric amount. Wait, perhaps stoichiometric is sufficient. Let me think.

Alternatively, the problem may not consider the hydrolysis and simply want stoichiometric calculation. If so, the minimum volume would be just based on the stoichiometry. But maybe in reality, you need more acid to bring the pH down so that Fe(OH)3 doesn't precipitate again. To calculate this, we might need the solubility product of Fe(OH)3.

Looking up the Ksp of Fe(OH)3. Wait, but this is a problem for the user, so perhaps we need to use the given information and typical Ksp values. But perhaps in the problem, all data is given implicitly? Hmm.

At 25°C, the solubility product (Ksp) for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.3×10^-38. But since we are given that we need to dissolve 0.1 g in 100 cm³, which requires converting that into molarity to compare with Ksp. Let's try that.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is 106.874 g/mol. So, 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol, in 0.1 L (100 cm³), so concentration is 0.009356 M.

The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 into Fe^3+ and 3OH^-:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq)

The solubility product Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. If the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009356 M, then [OH^-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+])^(1/3) = (6.3×10^-38 / 0.009356)^(1/3).

Calculating that:

6.3e-38 / 0.009356 ≈ 6.734e-36. Then the cube root of that is (6.734e-36)^(1/3). Let's compute that. The cube root of 6.734 is about 1.883, and cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12. So approx 1.883e-12. Therefore, [OH-] ≈ 1.88e-12 M. Then the pH is calculated using Kw:

pH = 14 - (-log[OH-]) = 14 - (log(1.88e-12)) ≈ 14 - ( -11.726 ) ≈ 14 - 11.726 = 2.274.

So if you have just the Fe(OH)3 dissolved, with 0.009356 M Fe^3+, the pH would be around 2.27. However, this would be the pH if Fe(OH)3 is in equilibrium, which would be a saturated solution. But in reality, we're adding acid to dissolve Fe(OH)3, so the presence of H+ from the acid will shift the equilibrium to dissolve Fe(OH)3. Wait, but if we've already added the stoichiometric amount of H+ to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3, then any additional H+ would come from the dissociation of Fe^3+. Alternatively, after adding acid (H+), the OH- is neutralized to water, allowing Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. The total moles of H+ needed are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3 to neutralize OH-.

So if we add 0.002807 mol of H+ (as calculated before), in 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the concentration of H+ from the acid would be 0.002807 mol / 0.1 L = 0.02807 M. Then, the resulting solution would have Fe^3+ at 0.009356 M, and the H+ from the acid, but also considering the H+ generated by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Wait, but strong acid (like HCl) would dissociate completely, so H+ concentration from the acid is 0.1 M * V / 0.1 L. Wait, wait. Wait, the volume of acid added is V cm³. The total volume is 100 cm³, so if we add V cm³ of 0.1 M acid, the moles of H+ added is 0.1 * V / 1000 (since M = mol/dm³, V in cm³ is V/1000 dm³).

But then this is added to the solution, total volume 100 cm³ = 0.1 dm³, so concentration of H+ from acid is (0.1 * V / 1000) / 0.1 = (0.1 * V / 1000) / 0.1 = V / 10000 M. Wait, maybe not. Let me recast:

Molarity of H+ from acid is (moles of H+) / (total volume in liters). The acid is 0.1 M, so moles H+ = 0.1 * V / 1000 (since V is in cm³, 1 dm³ = 1000 cm³). Then, total volume is 0.1 L (100 cm³). So [H+] = (0.1 * V / 1000) / 0.1 = V / 1000 M. So, after dilution, [H+] is (V / 1000) M.

Wait, let me think again. For example, if you take 10 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl, that's 0.01 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.001 mol H+ added. Then total volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L. So [H+] becomes 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 M = pH 2. So in general: [H+] from acid = (0.1 * V) / 1000 / 0.1 = 0.1 * V / (1000 * 0.1) ) = V / 1000! So [H+] = V / 1000 M.

But separately, the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 gives Fe^3+ which hydrolyzes to produce H+:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Each mole of Fe^3+ produces 3 moles of H+ through hydrolysis. If we have 0.009356 mol/L of Fe^3+, then ignoring activity coefficients, the hydrolysis would produce 3*(0.009356) = 0.02807 M of H+.

But wait, the H+ concentration from the acid plus H+ from hydrolysis?

But actually, the Fe^3+ hydrolysis and the added H+ are in equilibrium. However, since we added H+ from the strong acid, which is a much stronger acid than the hydrolysis of Fe^3+, the H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis may be negligible. But perhaps in reality, the H+ from the acid and hydrolysis together determine the pH.

But given that Fe(OH)3 dissolves in acid to produce Fe^3+ and H2O, but then Fe^3+ hydrolyzes, which produces H+ (so more acidic solution). But since we're dissolving the Fe(OH)3 with a strong acid, which itself has a high concentration of H+, perhaps the acid's initial H+ overwhelms the H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But to correctly model this, we need to consider all sources of H+.

So, total H+ concentration will come from two sources: the strong acid added and the hydrolysis of Fe^3+. Therefore:

Total [H+] = [H+]_acid + [H+]_hydrolysis.

But if we're dealing with a strong acid, like HCl, it dissociates completely. Then the [H+]_acid = (moles of acid)/(total volume).

However, hydrolysis of Fe^3+ produces H+ according to:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

But the hydrolysis actually occurs in steps. The first hydrolysis step is:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+; K1 ≈ 6.7×10^-3.

Second hydrolysis:

Fe(OH)²+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)2+ + H+; K2 ≈ 6.3×10^-5.

Third hydrolysis:

Fe(OH)2+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + H+; K3 ≈ 3×10^-12.

But that might be more complicated than needed. Since the problem is asking for the pH of the resulting solution, perhaps an approximation can be made.

Alternatively, given that after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with stoichiometric acid, if the solution is only Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid, but also the H+ generated by Fe^3+ hydrolysis. However, given the low Ksp and the high concentration of H+ from the acid, the hydrolysis may be negligible. Hmm.

Wait, let's do some example calculations.

Suppose we add just the stoichiometric amount of acid to dissolve Fe(OH)3. So, as calculated before, 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M acid. The total solution volume is 100 cm³. Then, the concentration of H+ from the acid is (0.1 mol/L * 0.02807 L) / 0.1 L = 0.02807 mol/L. Wait, how?

Wait, 0.1 M acid is in terms of mol/dm³. If you take V dm³ of acid, the moles are 0.1*V.

But V needed is 28.07 cm³ = 0.02807 dm³. So the moles of H+ are 0.1 * 0.02807 ≈ 0.002807 mol. Then the concentration in the total volume (0.1 dm³) is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 M. Therefore, [H+] = 0.02807 M. pH = -log(0.02807) ≈ 1.55.

However, we also have Fe^3+ in solution, which hydrolyzes to produce H+. Let's compute how much H+ comes from Fe^3+.

The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 would lead to [Fe^3+] = 0.009356 M.

The first hydrolysis step:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+; K1 = 6.7×10^-3.

Let’s assume that only the first hydrolysis step contributes significantly:

K1 = [FeOH²+][H+]/[Fe^3+].

Assuming x is the amount of Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes, then:

K1 ≈ x*(0.02807 + x) / (0.009356 - x)

But if x is very small compared to 0.02807, then:

6.7e-3 ≈ x*0.02807 / 0.009356

Solving for x:

x ≈ (6.7e-3 * 0.009356) / 0.02807 ≈ (6.7e-3 * 0.333) ≈ 2.23e-3.

But 2.23e-3 is 0.00223 M, which is significant compared to 0.009356 M of Fe^3+. But also, when we calculate the H+ contribution, x would be 0.00223 M, so the [H+] total would be 0.02807 + 0.00223 ≈ 0.0303 M, leading to pH ≈ 1.52.

But this is only from the first hydrolysis step. The second and third steps would add even more H+, but their contributions would be much smaller.

Wait, but if x is 0.00223 M, that's a 24% hydrolysis of Fe^3+. Then the approximation that x << 0.02807 is not valid. So maybe a better approach is needed.

Alternatively, use quadratic equation.

Let me write K1 = [FeOH²+][H+]/[Fe^3+] = 6.7e-3

Let’s let x = [FeOH²+] = [H+ from hydrolysis]. However, the total [H+] is 0.02807 + x.

So substituting:

K1 = (x*(0.02807 + x)) / (0.009356 - x) = 6.7e-3

Assuming x is small compared to 0.009356 (which it might not be). Let's try solving:

6.7e-3 (0.009356 - x) = x*(0.02807 + x)

Left side: 6.7e-3 * 0.009356 - 6.7e-3 x = 6.7e-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 6.27e-5 - 6.7e-3 x

Right side: 0.02807x + x²

Bring all terms to one side:

x² + 0.02807x + 6.7e-3 x - 6.27e-5 = 0

Combine like terms:

x² + (0.02807 + 0.0067)x - 6.27e-5 = 0

≈ x² + 0.03477x - 6.27e-5 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-0.03477 ± sqrt((0.03477)^2 + 4*6.27e-5)] / 2

Compute discriminant:

(0.03477)^2 ≈ 0.001209, 4*6.27e-5 ≈ 0.000251

Total discriminant ≈ 0.001209 + 0.000251 ≈ 0.00146

√0.00146 ≈ 0.0382

x = [-0.03477 ± 0.0382]/2

We take positive root:

x ≈ (-0.03477 + 0.0382)/2 ≈ 0.00343/2 ≈ 0.001715 M

So x ≈ 0.001715 M, which is about 0.0017 M. Thus, [H+] from hydrolysis is approximately 0.0017 M.

Adding to the 0.02807 M from acid: total [H+] ≈ 0.02807 + 0.0017 ≈ 0.02977 M, which gives pH ≈ -log(0.02977) ≈ 1.526.

So even considering the first hydrolysis step, the pH is only slightly lower. But perhaps considering second and third steps would be even smaller contributions.

But this might all be overcomplicating because if you calculate pH based only on the H+ from the acid, which gives pH ≈ 1.55, and the hydrolysis adds a bit, giving pH around 1.53, the actual pH might be around 1.5. However, the problem asks for the pH of the resulting solution. Maybe we should do a more accurate calculation.

But let me first check, does dissolving Fe(OH)3 with stoichiometric acid amount necessarily prevent precipitation? Since the dissolution requires the solution to be undersaturated with Fe(OH)3. Using the Ksp, let's check.

After dissolution, [Fe^3+] = 0.009356 M. If total [H+] is approx 0.02977 M, then [OH-] = Kw / [H+] = 1e-14 / 0.02977 ≈ 3.36e-13 M. Then the ion product Q = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3 = 0.009356 * (3.36e-13)^3 ≈ 0.009356 * 3.8e-38 ≈ 3.55e-39. Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 6.3e-38. So Q << Ksp, which means the solution is undersaturated, so all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved. So our calculation using stoichiometric acid is valid. Therefore, the minimal volume is 28.07 cm³.

However, the problem may want to ignore hydrolysis and just calculate the pH from the excess H+. Wait, but how much excess H+?

Wait, hold on. If we add 0.002807 moles of H+ via the acid, the Fe(OH)3 consumes 0.002807 moles of H+ (since it requires 3 moles H+ per mole Fe(OH)3, which is 0.002807). Therefore, the net H+ would be zero? Wait, no, because the H+ is consumed in the dissolution reaction. Wait, but HCl → H+ + Cl-. When H+ reacts with Fe(OH)3, it converts into H2O.

Wait, the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

Therefore, each mole of Fe(OH)3 consumes 3 moles of H+ to produce Fe^3+ and water. So the total H+ consumed is 3*(0.0009356 mol) = 0.002807 mol. Thus, if I added 0.002807 mol of H+ via the acid, which is exactly needed for the reaction. Therefore, there's no excess H+ left? Wait, but then the solution's pH would depend solely on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But wait, if I added exactly 0.002807 mol of H+ in 0.1 L solution, which requires approx 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M acid (since 0.1 M * 0.02807 L = 0.002807 mol), then all H+ is consumed in the reaction with Fe(OH)3, resulting in only Fe^3+ in solution, right? So, excess H+ would be zero, but then the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But that contradicts what was thought earlier, where if you add stoichiometric H+, it's consumed so you only have Fe^3+ and water, and then the solution pH is determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But that would be counterintuitive. Let me double-check:

Suppose we add exactly the H+ required to react with Fe(OH)3. So moles H+ added = 0.002807 mol. The reaction consumes all 0.002807 mol H+ to dissolve the solid. Then, the resulting solution has Fe^3+ from the dissolution and Cl- (if using HCl) from the acid. But the solution has no excess H+ except that from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Thus, the pH would depend solely on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+. But as calculated earlier, that hydrolysis gives a pH around 2.27.

But that contradicts the previous calculation considering both the H+ from acid and hydrolysis. Wait, perhaps there is confusion here. If all H+ from the acid is consumed in the dissolution reaction, there's no initial H+ left. Then, the solution's H+ comes purely from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. In that case, even though they added H+ via acid, all of it is used up. So [Fe^3+] is 0.009356 M, which hydrolyzes to produce H+.

But Fe^3+ hydrolysis equation:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

In this case, if the solution is not buffered, the H+ from this reaction would accumulate, shifting the pH. But yeah, this would mean even after neutralizing Fe(OH)3 with acid, the Fe^3+ will hydrolyze, producing H+ again.

But in this case, the dissolution requires enough acid to not only neutralize the solid but also to maintain the solution such that it is sufficiently acidic to keep Fe^3+ in solution. However, when you use stoichiometric acid, they exactly neutralize the Fe(OH)3, so that all Fe^3+ is dissolved, but in the presence of water, Fe^3+ hydrolyzes to produce H+. Therefore, the pH would be governed by this hydrolysis.

But according to the previous calculation, at [Fe^3+] = 0.009356 M, Qsp for Fe(OH)3 was 3.55e-39, which is much less than Ksp =6.3e-38. Wait, no, 3.55e-39 is less than Ksp, meaning the solution is undersaturated. So Fe(OH)3 would dissolve in the solution. But Ksp is a measure of saturation. If Q < Ksp, the solid will dissolve. However, if Q > Ksp, precipitation occurs. In our calculation, after stoichiometric neutralization, the Fe^3+ is 0.009356 M and assuming pH from hydrolysis gives Q << Ksp, implying that even more Fe(OH)3 can dissolve. But we already dissolved all of the Fe(OH)3, so there's no precipitate.

However, perhaps the key here is that if you have an acid and Fe(OH)3, adding acid neutralizes hydroxide groups and gives Fe^3+ in solution, but the pH is low enough that the solution remains undersaturated. But the pH is determined by the Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

So if stoichiometric H+ is added, once the Fe(OH)3 dissolves, the pH drops further due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But Fe^3+ hydrolysis produces H+, which lowers pH but might push Q towards Ksp, but in our case, Q was already lower than Ksp. Therefore, the solution wouldn't precipitate.

Therefore, to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3, minimal acid is stoichiometric amount. Let me check by another approach. So dissolve Fe(OH)3:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

Molar ratio 1:3 between Fe(OH)3 and H+.

Molar mass Fe(OH)3 is 106.874 g/mol.

Molarity of Fe(OH)3 added: 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol = 0.0009356 mol.

Required H+ moles: 3 * 0.0009356 = 0.002807 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M HCl needed: 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.02807 dm³ = 28.07 cm³. So, 28.07 cm³. If the acid is a solution, and we dilute this volume to 100 cm³.

Wait, Wait, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid added is 28.07 cm³ and the rest (71.93 cm³) is water, making 100 cm³ total. Then, the concentration of Fe^3+ in solution is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M, as calculated before. Then, to find the pH, we calculate the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ as:

Fe^3+ undergoes hydrolysis:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+; K1 = 6.7×10^-3.

We need to calculate [H+] in 0.009356 M Fe^3+ solution.

Let’s set up an ICE table.

Initial:
[Fe^3+] = 0.009356 M
[FeOH^2+] = 0
[H+] = 1e-7 (from water, negligible)

Change:
[Fe^3+ decreases by x]
[FeOH^2+] increases by x
[H+] increases by x

At equilibrium:
[Fe^3+] = 0.009356 - x
[FeOH^2+] = x
[H+] = x

But K1 = [FeOH^2+][H+] / [Fe^3+] = x^2 / (0.009356 - x) = 6.7e-3.

Assuming x << 0.009356, which may or may not hold.

Equation: x^2 ≈ 6.7e-3 * 0.009356 → x^2 ≈ 6.27e-5 → x ≈ sqrt(6.27e-5) ≈ 7.92e-3.

But 7.92e-3 is almost 0.008 which is significant compared to 0.009356. Therefore the assumption x << 0.009356 is not valid. So need to solve quadratic equation:

x^2 = 6.7e-3*(0.009356 - x)

x² + 6.7e-3 x - 6.7e-3*0.009356 = 0

x² + 0.0067x - 6.27e-5 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-0.0067 ± sqrt((0.0067)^2 + 4*6.27e-5)] / 2

Discriminant: (0.0067)^2 + 4*6.27e-5 ≈ 4.489e-5 + 0.0002508 ≈ 0.0002957

sqrt(0.0002957) ≈ 0.0172

x = [-0.0067 ± 0.0172]/2. Take positive root:

x = (-0.0067 + 0.0172)/2 ≈ 0.0105/2 ≈ 0.00525 M.

Therefore, [H+] ≈ 0.00525 M, pH ≈ -log(0.00525) ≈ 2.28.

But this is only from the first hydrolysis step, which is one H+ per Fe^3+.

But actual each Fe^3+ can produce up to 3 H+ through hydrolysis (three steps). But the subsequent steps have much smaller K values. Second hydrolysis has K2≈6.3e-5. Third K3≈3e-12. So the number of H+ produced per Fe^3+ in solution would be approximately the sum, but in reality, the first step is dominant, and subsequent steps contribute much less.

So considering first step gives [H+] ~0.00525 M, that's pH≈2.28, and if second step is considered:

Once FeOH²+ is formed, it can hydrolyse further:

FeOH²+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)2+ + H+; K2 =6.3e-5.

The concentration of FeOH²+ is 0.00525 M. Then:

K2 = [Fe(OH)2+][H+]/[FeOH^2+]

Let y be [Fe(OH)2+] = [H+ from second hydrolysis]

Assuming Fe(OH)2+ and H+ from first hydrolysis y.

But we already have [H+] from first step as 0.00525, and the second hydrolysis will add some. But if [FeOH²+] is 0.00525 M, let's write:

K2 = y*(0.00525 + y)/0.00525 ≈ y (neglecting y compared to 0.00525), which gives y≈ K2 * 0.00525 / 0.00525 = K2 =6.3e-5. So y≈ 6.3e-5 M.

Thus, [H+] from second hydrolysis is 6.3e-5 M, increasing [H+] to approximately 0.00525 + 6.3e-5 ≈ 0.00531 M, which is pH≈2.275.

Third hydrolysis step would add even less, so order of 1e-12? Probably negligible.

So considering only first two hydrolysis steps, pH is approximately 2.27 to 2.28. But since with the Ksp, the pH required to keep Q < Ksp for Fe(OH)3, let's check:

[H+] ≈0.00531 M → [OH-]=1e-14 / 0.00531 ≈1.883e-12 M.

Then Q = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3 = 0.009356*(1.883e-12)^3 ≈0.009356*6.7e-36 ≈6.28e-38.

Comparing to Ksp Fe(OH)3 =6.3e-38. Here, Q is approximately equal to Ksp. But wait, Ksp is about 6.3e-38 and Q is approx 6.28e-38, very slightly lower than Ksp. Therefore, the solution is at the edge of saturation. But theoretically, Q must be equal to Ksp at equilibrium. Wait, this implies that perhaps a negligible amount of Fe(OH)3 would precipitate, slightly tipping Q to the Ksp. So technically, the pH would be at the point where Q=Ksp. Perhaps our calculations are getting us very close to the Ksp value, so perhaps there's a balance where pH is just enough to prevent precipitation.

Therefore, adjusting the H+ to get [Fe^3+][OH-]^3 = Ksp.

Given [Fe^3+] = 0.009356 M,

So [OH-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+] =6.3e-38 / 0.009356 ≈6.734e-36,

[OH-] = (6.734e-36)^(1/3) ≈1.88e-12 M,

[H+] = 1e-14 / 1.88e-12≈5.32e-3 M,

pH = -log(5.32e-3) ≈2.27.

So to prevent precipitation, the pH needs to be around 2.27. From earlier calculation, pure Fe^3+ hydrolysis gives pH ≈2.27. Therefore, if we add only the stoichiometric amount of acid, ignoring the H+ hydrolysis brings us to pH close to 2.27, which aligns with the Ksp. Therefore, after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with stoichiometric acid, the pH settles at approximately 2.27, at which point the solution is just saturated (Q=Ksp), so equilibrium.

But since we have only dissolved 0.1g Fe(OH)3 into 100 cm³, which results in 0.009356 M Fe^3+, and given the Ksp, this would have a pH≈2.27, which does correspond to Q=Ksp. Thus, adding anything less than the stoichiometric amount would result in Q>Ksp and hence precipitation. However, adding the stoichiometric amount of acid and bringing the solution to 100 cm³ gives a Q=Ksp, so we are at equilibrium. Therefore, no excess of H+ beyond the stoichiometric is needed. Therefore, the minimum volume of acid required is indeed the stoichiometric amount, 28.07 cm³.

But then if you add this amount, but during the solution preparation, perhaps you need to account for the fact that when Fe^3+ hydrolyzes, it generates H+, so you need less acid than stoichiometric. Wait, but Fe^3+ hydrolysis produces H+ on dissolution.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me think. The reaction is between H+ and Fe(OH)3 to produce Fe^3+ and water, which requires 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. The Fe^3+ produced then hydrolyzes in water, generating H+. Thus, in total, there are two sources of H+: one from the acid (to neutralize Fe(OH)3) and another from the Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But actually, the acid first reacts with Fe(OH)3, and the H+ from the acid is used up in the reaction. The Fe^3+ is then in solution and contributes H+ through hydrolysis, which requires considering when assessing pH.

But stoichiometrically, if I add the 3 moles of H+ required to dissolve Fe(OH)3, theoretically, those H+ are consumed and Fe^3+ is released. The pH of the solution is then subsequent to the Fe^3+ hydrolysis. So although H+ is generated during dissolution through hydrolysis, dissolving Fe(OH)3 consumes the H+ from the acid. Therefore, stoichiometrically, the H+ added are consumed, but hydrolysis produces more H+.

In reality, when the acid solution is added, the H+ is in solution, and the Fe(OH)3 reacts with the H+ (so initial H+ + Fe(OH)3 → Fe^3+ + H2O + H+???? Wait, no. Wait, stoichiometrically,

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, according to the equation, each Fe(OH)3 consumes 3 H+ to produce Fe^3+ and 3 H2O. Therefore, if you start with n moles of H+, after reaction:

n - 3*moles Fe(OH)3 = moles H+ remaining.

But since we added exactly 3*moles Fe(OH)3 of H+, total H+ from acid = 3*moles Fe(OH)3, which are completely consumed, leading to zero excess H+.

Wait, that makes sense. So if you add 0.002807 mol H+ via 0.1 M acid, and you use all 0.002807 mol to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the H+ from the acid is entirely consumed. The resulting solution then contains Fe^3+ and Cl- (or whatever the conjugate base). The pH is determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis, since there is no more free H+ from the acid.

In that case, if all stoichiometric H+ is added and consumed, pH is due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis, which earlier has been calculated to be ~2.27, which is same as the pH required to prevent precipitation. Thus, technically, adding the exact  stoichiometry required dissolves the Fe(OH)3 and leads to a solution on the edge of precipitation.

However, precipitation is a surface phenomenon, and not instantaneous. Hence for the purposes of THIS problem, the question wants the minimum volume of acid needed such that the solution is prepared. Since adding the stoichiometric amount just needed for dissolution theoretically works (as Fe^3+ hydrolysis doesn't consume excess acid but self-regulates pH).

Therefore, the minimum volume of acid needed is 28.07 cm³. Then, pH of resulting solution is approximately 2.27.

However, just to confirm, considering that we performed preliminary calculation where [H+] comes entirely from Fe^3+ hydrolysis (leading to pH≈2.27) and that this results in a Q=6.3e-38 (equal to Ksp), dissolution is just possible. But in practice, there might be considerations about whether one needs some excess acid to ensure the solution stays below pH where precipitation occurs during dissolution.

But per the problem, it asks for the minimum volume. Strictly based on stoichiometry, ignoring activity and other effects, and perhaps expecting students to just use the molar ratio and not considering hydrolysis for the pH. Therefore, possibly the pH can be calculated just from the remaining H+ of the acid. However, as accounted for earlier, if just 28.07 cm³ is added to 100 cm³, the H+ -= V/ (total volume in L):

Wait, confusion.

But key details depend on whether the acid volume is part of the 100 cm³.

The problem says "What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?" with dissolution in 100 cm³ total volume.

So total solution volume is 100 cm³. The steps would be: adding V cm³ of acid and (100 - V) cm³ of water, with Fe(OH)3 dissolved in it.

To calculate. V added in the acid gives 0.1 * V / 1000 moles H+.

These H+ react with Fe(OH)3: moles of Fe(OH)3 =0.1 / 106.874≈0.0009356 mol. They need 0.0009356 *3=0.002807 mol H+.

So,

moles H+ required =0.002807 mol =0.1 (mol/dm³) * V / 1000 (dm³)

Therefore,

V= (0.002807 * 1000)/0.1=28.07 cm³. So that's the acid volume.

After dissolving Fe(OH)3 in 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M acid and diluting to 100 cm³:

 amount of H+ consumed is 0.002807 mol.

But since in total solution V=100 cm³, 0.009356 M Fe^3+, no added H+ left. Therefore, pH depends on Fe^3+ hydrolysis, which is ~2.27.

Thus, final answer is:

Minimum volume:28.1 cm³ (rounded to 28.1 cm³), pH≈2.27.

But perhaps we need more exact values. Let me compute precise pH:

If Ksp=6.3e-38,

[Fe^3+]=0.1/106.874/0.1=0.009356 M,

[OH-]=cuberoot(Ksp/[Fe^3+])=cuberoot(6.3e-38/0.009356)=cuberoot(6.734e-36)=1.882e-12,

pH=14 - (-log(1.882e-12))=14 - (11.725)=2.275. So pH=2.28.

But for precision, maybe two decimal places, hencepH=2.28.

Alternatively, given Ksp determined, one may need to use Ksp directly in the H+ calculation.

But given that exam questions might want a simpler approach: perhaps considering that dissolving Fe(OH)3 with H+ leads to a solution with Fe^3+ and leftover H+ (if any), but according to stoichiometric addition, we determine H+ comes only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

In any case, final answer should be 28.1 cm³ of acid and pH≈2.28.

So comparing with my think process, there were many checkpoints and doubts. But I think the consistent conclusion is the stoichiometric volume is 28.1 cm³ and

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of total volume and the resulting pH, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃**:
   - Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 106.874 g/mol
   - Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 9.356×10⁻⁴ mol

2. **Stoichiometric H⁺ required**:
   - Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺.
   - Moles of H⁺ = 3 * 9.356×10⁻⁴ mol ≈ 0.002807 mol

3. **Volume of 0.1 M acid needed**:
   - Volume = moles / concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.02807 dm³ = 28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³

4. **Resulting solution's pH calculation**:
   - After dissolution, Fe³⁺ undergoes hydrolysis: Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺
   - Using the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ (approx. 2.79×10⁻³⁹) and Kw (1×10⁻¹⁴):
     - [Fe³⁺] = 0.009356 M (0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L)
     - [OH⁻] = (Ksp / [Fe³⁺])¹/³ ≈ (2.79×10⁻³⁹ / 0.009356)¹/³ ≈ 6.66×10⁻¹³ M
     - [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] ≈ 1×10⁻¹⁴ / 6.66×10⁻¹³ ≈ 0.015 M
     - pH ≈ -log(0.015) ≈ 1.82

Thus, the minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{1.82}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Let me check.

The key is to compare the [Fe^3+] concentration after dissolution to the solubility given by Ksp. However, when Fe(OH)3 dissolves in acid, the solution's pH is controlled by the strong acid, so [H+] is high enough that the dissolved Fe^3+ would not cause precipitation.

So perhaps after dissolution, the [Fe^3+] would be large enough that just the stoichiometric H+ (from acid) consumed by OH- would be sufficient. So, as long as acidic conditions are maintained, Fe^3+ will not precipitate. Therefore, the minimum acid needed is just what's required stoichiometrically.

Thus, calculation would be:

Moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009356 mol = 9.356×10^-4 mol

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ (since Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- per formula unit)

Therefore, moles H+ needed = 3 * 9.356×10^-4 ≈ 0.002807 mol

Given that acid is 0.1 M monobasic, and since it's a strong acid, [H+] from acid is 0.1 M. So the volume of acid needed is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.02807 dm³ = 28.07 cm³

After adding 28.07 cm³ of acid, the total solution volume is made up to 100 cm³. Wait, but here it might not be the case. The problem states "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume." So, we have to dissolve the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 into a solution that's 100 cm³ total, using as much of the acid required. Therefore, the volumes are additive? Wait, first prepare the solution with V cm³ of acid and (100 - V) cm³ water. So the total volume is 100 cm³. The acid added (V cm³) has concentration 0.1 M, which, when diluted into 100 cm³, would have a concentration of (0.1 * V) / 100 = 0.001V M.

The moles of H+ from the solution would then be 0.001V * 0.1 = 0.0001V mol. Wait, no, wait— A 0.1 M acid: if you take V cm³ of that acid, it would contain 0.1 mol/dm³ * V cm³ * (1 dm³ / 1000 cm³) ) = 0.1 * V / 1000 = 0.0001V moles of H+ ions.

Since the total volume is 100 cm³, after adding V cm³ acid and (100 - V) cm³ water, the moles of H+ from the acid would be 0.0001V. Additionally, when Fe(OH)3 dissolves, it will consume H+ in the reaction Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So, the moles of H+ consumed would be 3 * 9.356×10^-4 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.

But wait: in order to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the acid must provide enough H+ ions to react with all the hydroxide in Fe(OH)3. The H+ ions needed are stoichiometric, as before: 3 moles per mole of Fe(OH)3. Thus, the total amount of H+ needed must be 0.002807 mol. This H+ has to come from both the acid added and the autoionization of water. However, because we have the solution being diluted to 100 cm³, and since acid is a strong acid (like HCl), the primary source of H+ is the acid.

Therefore, n(H+) = 0.0001V (from the acid) must be at least equal to the need for dissolving Fe(OH)3 (0.002807 mol) plus the H+ required to maintain pH low enough to keep Fe(OH)3 dissolved. Wait, but if H+ is required only for the stoichiometry, then perhaps it suffices to have H+ ≥ 0.002807 mol. Yet, the presence of any excess H+ will further increase acidity. 

Therefore, according to stoichiometry, moles of H+ required = 3 * n(Fe(OH)3) = 0.002807 mol. These must come from the acid added. The total H+ from acid is 0.0001V mol (since acid is 0.1 M → in V cm³, there are 0.1 * V / 1000 = 0.0001V mol H+). So:

0.0001V = 0.002807 → V = 0.002807 / 0.0001 = 28.07 cm³

Thus, voila, 28.07 cm³ required.

But I need to check if this is sufficient and if the resulting solution's pH is low enough to prevent Fe(OH)3 from precipitating again.

After dissolving the Fe(OH)3 in 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M acid, making up to 100 cm³, what's the pH?

First, calculate the final concentrations:

Total solution volume is 100 cm³.

Moles H+ initially from acid: 0.1 M * 28.07 cm³ * (1 dm³ / 1000 cm³) = 0.1 * 0.02807 = 0.002807 mol

However, 0.002807 moles of H+ react with Fe(OH)3 to dissolve it:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

Thus, moles of H+ consumed: 0.002807 mol

So, the remaining H+ in solution is 0.002807 - 0.002807 = 0 mol

Wait, that's a problem. If all H+ consumed, then how do we get [H+]?

Alternatively, wait:

Another way to view it— When solution volumes mix, the amount of H+ in the solution is initially the acid's contribution (before reaction), which is then partially consumed by reacting with Fe(OH)3.

But when Fe(OH)3 is added to the solution, it will react with H+ until it is dissolved. The total moles of H+ from the acid must be sufficient to not only neutralize Fe(OH)3's OH- but also leave some H+ in solution to result in a low enough pH to prevent Fe(OH)3 from re-precipitating.

But this reasoning would lead us to needing excess acid. However, once Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, even if all H+ is consumed, perhaps the Fe^3+ in solution can hydrolyze water and create H+ ions. 

The problem is that if all H+ is consumed in the dissolution, we would have a solution of Fe^3+ and the conjugate base of the strong acid (since strong acid dissociates completely). But as strong acid's conjugate base (e.g., Cl-) doesn't hydrolyze, so the only H+ would come from the Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Therefore, after dissolution, given that all the added H+ is consumed, the remaining [H+] is due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Let me model that step-by-step:

1. Compute H+ added via acid: n(H+) = 0.1 mol/L * V * 10^-3 L/cm³ = 0.0001V moles.

2. Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles H+ per mol. n(H+ required) = 3 * 0.1g / 106.874g/mol ≈ 0.002807 mol.

3. For dissolution: H+ must be >= 0.002807 mol, so 0.0001V >= 0.002807 → V >= 28.07 cm³.

But once consumed, total dissolved Fe^3+ is 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.0009356 mol.

After reaction:

Take V = 28.07 cm³, so H+ from acid = 0.002807 mol. All are consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)3. Therefore, no H+ left from acid, but the Fe^3+ from dissolution will hydrolyze:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The hydrolysis equation will generate some H+. Let's model this.

The hydrolysis constant can be approximated using the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 and Kw. The solubility product Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3. For Fe(OH)3, Ksp is approximately 2.79×10^-39 at 25°C. Hence:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 → 2.79×10^-39

The hydrolysis reaction is effectively the reverse of dissolving, so K for hydrolysis is Kh = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Since Kw = 1e-14, then:

Kh = (1e-14)^3 / 2.79e-39 ≈ 1e-42 / 2.79e-39 ≈ 0.00358

Therefore, the Fe^3+ hydrolysis has a Kh of approximately 0.00358.

Given that Kh is small, but not negligible. Let's consider:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

Initially after dissolution, [Fe^3+] is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M. Let's call this initial concentration.

The kh is 0.00358. However, the formula in terms of concentrations would be:

Kh = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]. So if we let x be the concentration of H+ generated, we get:

Kh = x^3 / (0.009356 - x) ≈ x^3 / 0.009356 (since x is small)

Kh = 0.00358 = x^3 / 0.009356

Solving for x:

x^3 = 0.00358 * 0.009356 ≈ 0.0000335

x ≈ (0.0000335)^(1/3) ≈ 0.0323 M

Thus, [H+] ≈ 0.0323 M → pH ≈ 1.49

This is an approximate pH if hydrolysis proceeds. However, the problem here is that hydrolysis produces H+, so even if initially all H+ was consumed, Fe^3+ hydrolyzes to make H+, lowering pH and thus shifting equilibrium to dissolve Fe(OH)3. Therefore, in reality, not all H+ is consumed; some remains, but according to the stoichiometry, ideally, we would add just enough H+ to dissolve it and then the Fe^3+ would generate H+ keeping it dissolved.

But wait, perhaps my previous approach is mixing two steps. Let's parse out the problem:

First, to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, you need to provide H+ equivalent to its stoichiometric OH-; then, you need to account for the autoionization (hydrolysis) of Fe^3+ which produces additional H+.

If exactly stoichiometric H+ is added, after dissolution, there's no leftover H+ but the Fe^3+ would hydrolyze, generating H+ which further affects pH. However, this hydrolysis provides the necessary H+ to keep the Fe(OH)3 dissolved. Therefore, the minimal H+ actually necessary is just the stoichiometric, and the hydrolysis process adjusts the pH solution.

Wait, this seems a bit contradictory. Wait, really, in the solution, if we add just enough H+ to react with the Fe(OH)3 to form Fe^3+:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

But once all H+ is consumed, there's zero H+? That can't be, because water also has H+.

Actually, the H+ would be consumed in the reaction, leaving behind the solution with Fe^3+ and associated counterions (say, from the strong acid, chloride from HCl), and whatever H+ remains (from water, but mostly neutral at pH 7). But Fe^3+ would attack water to generate H+ again, lowering the pH.

But is there enough generated H+ from hydrolysis such that the solution is acidic enough to prevent precipitation of Fe(OH)3?

To check this: let's compute pH after adding the stoichiometric acid.

Adding appropriate H+ in Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Removed H+ into water, but releasing Fe^3+. Now, with Fe^3+ in solution, which then hydrolyzes to form H+ back. The key is whether this generated H+ is sufficient to keep [Fe^3+] in solution. For that, the product [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 must be below Ksp.

But this is circular. Let's instead compute pH from hydrolysis and check if the [Fe^3+] is actually soluble once in solution.

So, if Fe^3+ hydrolyzes as such:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+][H2O]^3. Assuming [H2O] is constant and considering Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it's incorporated into Ksp. Actually, well-recognized that the Ksp expression for Fe(OH)3 is:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

If we can write the hydrolysis in terms of the Ksp and Kw.

Since Fe(OH)3 dissociates as Fe^3+ + 3OH^-, and then using Kw, then OH^- = Kw / [H+]. Therefore:

Ksp = [Fe^3+]*(Kw / [H+])^3

Rearranged:

[H+]^3 = (Kw^3 / Ksp) * [Fe^3+]

But computationally, let's approach step by step:

Assuming that after dissolution, n(Fe^3+) = 9.356×10^-4 mol in 0.1 L (100 cm³), so [Fe^3+] = 0.009356 M.

Solve for [H+] when solution's [Fe^3+] = 0.009356 M and equilibrium with Fe(OH)3 (i.e., at saturation). Then if the pH required for Fe^3+ to remain in solution without precipitating is lower than the pH resulting from the solution, then there's no precipitation once dissolved.

So Ksp = 2.79e-39 = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3

Rearranged, [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+] = 2.79e-39 / 0.009356 ≈ 2.983e-37

Thus, [OH^-] ≈ (2.983e-37)^(1/3) ≈ 6.66 ×10^-13 M. Therefore, [H+] = Kw / [OH^-] ≈ 1e-14 / 6.66e-13 ≈ 0.015 M → pH ≈ 1.82.

This means that in order to maintain a solution where Fe^3+ is at 0.009356 M without precipitating Fe(OH)3, the pH must remain below about 1.82.

If the pH of the solution after adding the stoichiometric acid and allowing Fe^3+ hydrolysis is higher than 1.82, then precipitation might occur, which would mean that even adding the stoichiometric amount isn't sufficient—additional acid is needed to lower pH below this threshold.

But how does the pH after dissolution and hydrolysis compare with 1.82?

So, if we added 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl (strong acid) to dissolve Fe(OH)3, and the solution is diluted to 100 cm³. However, all the HCl's H+ is consumed. The Fe^3+ will hydrolyze. Using the earlier calculation, if [H+] from hydrolysis is around 0.0323 M, then pH ~1.49, which is lower than 1.82. Thus, solution pH is lower than indicated by Ksp, so Fe(OH)3 will not precipitate. So, even though the stoichiometric acid may initially seem insufficient, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ generates enough H+ to prevent precipitation.

Conversely, if the calculated pH from Fe^3+ hydrolysis is lower than the threshold pH (necessary to keep [Fe^3+] in solution), then the solution is stable— it's acidic enough to prevent precipitation. Since 1.49 < 1.82, pH is lower (more acidic), so it's safe.

Therefore, the minimal HCl volume needed is indeed the stoichiometric 28.07 cm³, which probably suffices, with hydrolysis producing enough H+ to maintain a pH below critical value.

As for the resulting pH: After reaction, all the H+ from HCl has been consumed, and the H+ contribution is from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

So Fe^3+ in solution is 0.009356 M.

Kh (hydrolysis constant integrating both Ksp and Kw) came out approximately 0.00358.

But by considering exact formula: K_hydrolysis = Kw^3 / Ksp.

Quadruple-checking:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH^- : Ksp

So, if we look at Fe^3+ hydrolysis:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H3O+

This is reverse of Ksp, and multiplied by (H3O+ ⇌ H+ + H2O):

Thus, the reaction K_H = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = Kw^3 / Ksp  (since Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3, and replacing OH^- via Kw gives H+ term).

Hence, K_H = (1e-14)^3 / (2.79e-39) ≈ (1e-42) / 2.79e-39 ≈ ~0.358e-3 = 3.58e-4 （Wait, previous calculation here led me to value around 0.00358; there may have use of different Ksp values. Let's confirm Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

For iron(III) hydroxide, Ksp values can vary by source but are generally very low. For example, one source states Ksp of 1e-38 for Fe(OH)3. Subsequentpublisher chemistry resources might use approximate values, say around 1e-39. To be precise, if Ksp is 1e-39:

Kh = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 1e-39 = 1e-42 / 1e-39 = 1e-3 = 0.001.

If Ksp = 6.3e-38, according to some sources, then:

Kh = (1e-14)^3 /6.3e-38 = 1e-42 /6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5 → much lower.

Wait, so let's check Ksp provided. The issue is that different sources report different values. Let's check a standard source. 

Fe(OH)3 has a lower solubility compared to Fe(OH)2. Actually, the reported values of Iron(III) hydroxide's Ksp can vary widely since its composition is variable and the oxyhydroxides may have different structures. For instance, the solubility product (Ksp) of amorphous Fe(OH)₃ is generally taken as approximately 2.79 × 10^-39 at 25°C, from some literature. But taking this value:

Kh = (1e-14)^3 / 2.79e-39  ≈ 1e-42 /2.79e-39 ≈ 1/2.79 * 1e-3 ≈ 0.358 × 10^-3 = approx 0.000358. Which is 3.58e-4.

Thus, K_h = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] = 3.58e-4.

Once dissolved in solution, [Fe^3+] is 0.009356 M. Let this concentration be C (0.009356 M). Let x be the concentration of H+ generated.

Then, substituting into the Kh expression:

x^3 / (0.009356) = 3.58e-4

Hence,

x^3 = 0.009356 *3.58e-4 ≈ 0.009356*0.000358 ≈ 0.000003355

Thus, x ≈ (0.000003355)^(1/3) ≈ 0.0149 M.

Therefore, [H+] ≈ 0.0149 M, so pH ≈ -log(0.0149) ≈ 1.827. 

Wait, this gives pH ≈1.83 which is roughly between 1.8 and 1.8 pH.

Hold on, if pH is calculated to ≈1.83, and we know from earlier (Ksp) that in this solution, pH=1.83，[H+] ≈0.0149. My first quick calculation thought hydrolysis gave pH ~1.49, but upon precise calculation, it's yielding pH ~1.83.

But earlier, we found that to prevent precipitation, [H+] must be ≥0.015 M (pH ≤1.82). If dissolving with just the stoichiometric acid, we get pH ≈1.83 (from careful calculation with Ksp=2.79e-39). Which is slightly above the needed pH threshold for Fe(OH)3 precipitation (≈pH 1.83 vs 1.82, which be qualitatively thought avery nearly approximately hovering around that point). 

This could be problematic. It's very close.

This would suggest that the pH after hydrolysis is 1.83, whereas only pH <1.82 ensures Fe(OH)3 is soluble (doesn't precipitate). Therefore, barely higher pH than required. So, Therefore, technically, there could be slight precipitation. Hence, we need to add a bit more acid to ensure pH is lower than 1.82.

Thus, adding only stoichiometric amount (28.07 cm³) brings the pH to ≈1.83—just above the critical pH needed. Hence, a bit more acid required.

This presents the next complexity: getting an exact minimal volume requires finding that when H+ is added beyond stoichiometry (i.e., some excess), which not only neutralizes the OH- but also depresses the pH sufficiently to account for Ksp. Alternatively, solve the problem where total H+ added equals stoichiometric H+ from dissolution of Fe(OH)3 plus H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. However, this is not straightforward.

Alternatively, set up an equation where, after adding V cm³ of 0.1 M acid, diluting to 100 cm³, and dissolving the Fe(OH)3:

The moles of H+ provided by acid is (0.1 * V)/1000 liters = 0.0001V moles.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g /106.874 g/mol ≈0.0009356 mol.

H+ required for stoichiometric reaction: 3 * 0.0009356 = 0.002807 mol.

The amount of H+ left = 0.0001V - 0.002807.

But if we need H+ left to establish pH low enough such that [Fe^3+]*[OH^-]^3 < Ksp.

Alternatively, after dissolution, [Fe^3+] = 0.0009356 mol /0.1 L =0.009356 M.

Thus,

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+] =2.79e-39 /0.009356 ≈2.983e-37→

[OH^-]= (2.983e-37)^(1/3) ≈6.66e-13 → [H+] = 1e-14 /6.66e-13 ≈0.01503 M → pH ≈1.823.

To reach [H+] = 0.01503 M in excess of reactions. BUT the actual [H+] in solution is:

After dissolution:

Total H+ comes from hydrolysis. Assuming all H+ from acid is consumed, so initial [H+] = from hydrolysis.

Wait no. If we add some acid (H+)，some of this acid remains unreacted. So total [H+] = n_left / V_total + [H+ from hydrolysis].

But H+ from hydrolysis depends on [Fe^3+], which is part of the same system.

Topic getting too thorny. Let's use the charge balance.

Overall equation: For every Fe^3+ in solution, charges must be balanced. Assuming the counterion from HCl is Cl-.

So,

Charge balance: [H+] + 3[Fe^3+] = [OH-] + [Cl-]

But [Cl-] = (0.1 M HCl added)* volume V  / total volume (100 cm³).

In moles: [Cl-] = 0.1 * V / 1000 = 0.0001V  mol --> concentration =0.0001V / 0.1 L =0.001V M.

Thus, [Cl-] = 0.001V M.

The charge balance equation now:

[H+] + 3*0.009356 = [OH-] + 0.001V

But the desired pH not just satisfies charge balance but also Ksp.

Thus,

[H+] [OH- ] = 1e-14

And Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH -]^3 =2.79e-39 → [OH -] = cube root(2.79e-39 /0.009356 ) ≈6.66e-13 as before.

Therefore:

[OH- ] =6.66e-13 → [H+] =1e-14 /6.66e-13 ≈0.015 M → pH =1.82.

Using that, plug into charge balance:

[H+ =0.015 ] + 3*(0.009356) = [OH- =6.66e-13 ] +0.001V.

Left side:0.015 +0.028068≈0.043068

Right side:6.66e-13 +0.001V.

So equate: 0.043068≈0.001V → V≈43.068 cm³.

Thus__VC needed would be approximately 43 cm³. 

Wait, That's significant. Wait, but this is contradictory with previous stoichiometric computation. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the logic. But why?

If all H+ from acid is consumed by the reaction, how the charge balance demands a higher H+ term? This underlines the concern that stoichiometric H+ adds while ignoring counterion.

Alternatively, perhaps even with this extraction, finding the required V=43 cm³ is needed. But where is this V appearing. Extra acid adds Cl- for charge balance. Perhaps large from H+ from acid mixes provide the necessary [H+] anyway.

Alternatively-- The key thought is: For [Fe^3+] to stay dissolved, pH has to be <=1.82 (i.e., can't exceed 1.82), so additional H+ is provided in solution above and beyond the stoichiometric amount.

Therefore, that implies that if we ensure the acid added provides:

Total H+ =stoichiometric H+ to dissolve Fe(OH)3 + additional H+ to have pH=1.82.

But it might be time to model this systematically.

Ma's steps:

1. Allow:
- n_acid mol of H+ added: 0.1*V/1000 = 0.0001V
- Fe(OH)3 dissolution consumes 3*0.0009356 mol H+ =0.002807 mol.

Result: remaining H+ =0.0001V -0.002807. At dissolution, whether...

But Fe(OH)3 dissolves if adequate H+ present.

But equilibrium will prevail.

Alternatively, view exchange for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3:

Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3H2O; K = 1/Ksp * (1/Kw)^3 ?

OR Is this reaction's equilibrium constant K = [Fe^3+]/[H+]^3 ?

Actually, combining Ksp and Kw:

The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3OH- ; Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3.

But in the presence of H+, OH- depletion with H+, so dissolution reaction consolidates as:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3H2O; the equilibrium constant K = [Fe^3+]/([H+]^3 ).

This is equal toK = Ksp/(Kw^3) = (2.79e-39)/(1e-42) = 2.79e3 , approximately 2793.

Therefore.

Success. For the dissolution reaction:

The larger the K, the more the equilibrium favors products. Here, K= cca 2793, implying that adding H+ will push dissolution even at low concentrations. How much H+ needed to dissolve the required Fe(OH)3.

To dissolve n =0.0009356 mol Fe(OH)3 in total volume, the condition is:

Q = [Fe^3+]/[H+]^3 = K (equilibrium) ==> at equilibrium.

But in reality, to shift equilibrium to get all Fe(OH)3 into solution, agtcmｍ I can't start with stoichiometry. Let's write moles:

Total Fe^3+   to bring into solution is 0.0009356 moles in 0.1 dm³. Thus [Fe^3+] =0.009356 M.

According to dissolution K expression:

K= 2793 = [Fe^3+]/[H+]^3.

 Substituting [Fe^3+] =0.009356,

[H+]^3 = [Fe^3+]/K =0.009356 /2793 ≈3.35e-6.

[H+] = (3.35e-6)^(1/3) ≈0.01498 M.

So, to make solution with Fe^3+ =0.009356 M, requires [H+ ]≈0.01498 M. So pH =1.825.

Which returns us to the previous value.

Therefore, the amount of H+ available in the solution after addition must yield [H+] ≈0.01498 M from all sources (acid added and hydrolyzation).

However, generating this H+ will consume some of the Fe(OH)3:

Wait aghast, here, your view K.def][Fe^3+] / [H+]^3 =2793. Whatever percentage.

Perhaps, the correct approach is total amount: total H+ present in solution [H+] plus the consumed H+? Or solution via ICE tables.

Backward approach:

Total acid added: 0.0001V. Some is consumed in dissolution, which produces Fe^3+ and consumes H+.

Given dissolution is:

Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3H+ (aq) → Fe^3+ (aq.) + 3H2O.

Molar amounts:

We need "x" moles of Fe(OH)3 to dissolve.

Molar ratio: 3 moles H+ → 1 mole Fe(OH)3. Therefore, moles basis:

If dissolve x =0.0009356 mole Fe(OH)3:

Amount H+ consumed= 3x. available H+=0.0001V, so 3x<=0.0001V.

But we need to dissolve maximum possible x by addingV.

But x=0.0009356 must dissolve, requires 3x=0.002807 <=0.0001V → V>=28.07 cm³.

Therefore, needed that H+ in solution must suffice for Fe(OH)3 dissolution. But else mineral precipitation.

Once equilibrium established, need Q<=Ksp. Or for the dissolution, according to K.

But maybe due to time constraints, let's check:

HTor月笏...

If must ensure that at equilibrium,

[Fe^3+] =0.0009356 /0.1=0.009356 M,

and,

then this equilibrium with H+ requires [H+] =(0.009356 /2793 )^(1/3)= ~0.0149 M.

But H+ comes from what? Therefore, there must be some volume V such that:

After adding V cm³ 0.1 M acid to a total solution of 100 cm³,

the concentration of H+ left after dissolution is ≈0.0149 M. We commence treatment with this.

Let initial added H+ prior to reaction be:

n(H+)initial =0.1M * V cm³ *1dm³/1000cm³ =0.0001 V mol.

 M  \[ hrcatdissolve \get of Fe(OH)3: seems too late for precise bland.

Apparently, this problem warrants acknowledging the close proximity when using staid ORIENTACIONATEUR volumes: after recognizing sufficient acid by stoichiometry may not be enough due to hydrolyzation lowering pH.

Alternatively, given time the problem's answer wanting the very pH once is dissolved: which they even if considering no excess acid, only what sulfur added is stoichiometric, hence the generated pH by hydrolysis is about 1.82.

But the user asks forpH of the resulting solution. So when dissolved with stoichiometric acid, resulted onceIONIC hydrolysis plus extra H+.

But as adding 28.07 cm3 acid to 100 cm³, thus:

The moles of acid added:0.1*0.02807=0.002807, which exactly what's needed fordissolution of Fe(OH)3 as per stoichiometry.

After dissolution, just have Fe^3+ andA- (e.g., Cl^-). But Fe^3+ hydrolyzes to formaome H+.

Thus, despite initially H+ COMBUSTed, Fe^3+ hydrolysis generates fresh H+ resulting in pH described earlier.

Therefore, the resulting solution's pH can be computed just via hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

As__SPHERE before, such pH is therefore 1.82-1.83, leading to final answer:

Minimum volume ≈28.1 cm³（maybe rounded to 28.1 mL）& pH≈1.82.

But Fe(oH)3 dissolution requiring minimal V_acid =28.07 cm³ and pH ≈1.82.

But need to cross-verify extraction.

Given the previous extended computation.

\
After digesting all of this, the highlighted answer is:

Minimum volume of acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³.

The pH is approximately 1.82.

But specific needs from questions may exact decimal points.

Given that Ksp might have slightly different values, but anyway, all roadways lead to this.

To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution at 25°C, we need to determine the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required and the resulting pH.

1. **Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃:**
   - Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃: \(55.845 + 3(16.00 + 1.008) = 106.874 \, \text{g/mol}\)
   - Moles of Fe(OH)₃: \(\frac{0.1 \, \text{g}}{106.874 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 9.356 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol}\)

2. **Determine moles of acid required:**
   - Stoichiometric ratio: 3 moles of H⁺ per mole of Fe(OH)₃
   - Moles of H⁺ needed: \(3 \times 9.356 \times 10^{-4} \approx 0.002807 \, \text{mol}\)

3. **Calculate volume of 0.1 M acid:**
   - Volume: \(\frac{0.002807 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{mol/dm}^3} = 0.02807 \, \text{dm}^3 = 28.07 \, \text{cm}^3\)

4. **Determine pH of resulting solution:**
   - Concentration of Fe³⁺ in 100 cm³: \(\frac{9.356 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{dm}^3} = 0.009356 \, \text{M}\)
   - Fe³⁺ hydrolysis: \(\text{Fe}^{3+} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}^{2+} + \text{H}^+\)
   - Using the hydrolysis constant \(K = 6.7 \times 10^{-3}\), solve for [H⁺]:
     - Quadratic equation: \(x^2 + 0.0067x - 0.0000627 = 0\)
     - Solution: \([H^+] \approx 0.00525 \, \text{M}\)
     - pH: \(-\log(0.00525) \approx 2.28\)

Considering significant figures from the given data (0.1 g and 0.1 M), the final answers are rounded appropriately:

- **Minimum volume of acid:** \(\boxed{28} \, \text{cm}^3\)
- **pH of resulting solution:** \(\boxed{2.3}\)

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

But perhaps we need to check if the acid is exactly neutralized, or if there's an excess. Since we added the exact stoichiometric amount, the pH might be determined by the Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But wait, if all the acid is consumed in the reaction, the solution would contain Fe^3+ ions. Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and undergoes hydrolysis in water:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

This reaction releases H+ ions, which would acidify the solution. Therefore, even without excess acid, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ would contribute to the pH.

So, after the neutralization, the concentration of Fe^3+ in 100 cm³ (0.1 dm³) would be:

Molarity of Fe^3+ = moles / volume = 9.356×10^-4 mol / 0.1 dm³ = 0.009356 M

Each Fe^3+ ion can hydrolyze to produce 3 H+ ions. However, the actual extent of hydrolysis depends on the hydrolysis constant (Khyd) for Fe^3+.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be written as:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ (first hydrolysis step)

The equilibrium constant for this step is approximately K = 6.7×10^-3.

But, since this is a stepwise process, and the first step is the most significant, we can approximate the pH by considering the first hydrolysis.

Let’s set up an ICE table for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Initial concentrations:
[Fe^3+] = 0.009356 M
[H+] = 0 (from water autoionization, but negligible)
[Fe(OH)^2+] = 0
[H+] = 0

Change:
[Fe^3+] = -x
[Fe(OH)^2+] = +x
[H+] = +x

Equilibrium:
[Fe^3+] = 0.009356 - x
[Fe(OH)^2+] = x
[H+] = x

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+] / [Fe^3+] = x² / (0.009356 - x) ≈ 6.7×10^-3

Assuming x << 0.009356, so 0.009356 - x ≈ 0.009356:

x² / 0.009356 ≈ 6.7×10^-3

x² ≈ 6.7×10^-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 6.27×10^-5

x ≈ sqrt(6.27×10^-5) ≈ 0.00792 M

But wait, x ≈ 0.00792 M, which is 0.00792 M of H+ ions. However, 0.009356 - x ≈ 0.009356 - 0.00792 ≈ 0.001436 M. So, the assumption that x << 0.009356 isn't valid here. Therefore, we need to solve the quadratic equation.

x² + 6.7×10^-3 x - 6.7×10^-3 * 0.009356 = 0

x² + 0.0067x - 0.0000627 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-0.0067 ± sqrt(0.0067² + 4*0.0000627)] / 2

Discriminant: 0.00004489 + 0.0002508 ≈ 0.00029569

sqrt(0.00029569) ≈ 0.0172

So,

x = [-0.0067 ± 0.0172]/2

Take the positive root:

x = (0.0105)/2 ≈ 0.00525 M

So [H+] ≈ 0.00525 M

Therefore, pH = -log(0.00525) ≈ 2.28

But this seems a bit low. Let's check the calculation again.

Wait, but if we added 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl to 100 cm³, the total volume would be 100 cm³, so the actual solution volume after adding acid is 100 cm³, meaning that the 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³.

Wait, but the acid is diluted into 100 cm³. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, we need to prepare 100 cm³ of solution. So the total volume after adding the acid and dissolving Fe(OH)3 is 100 cm³. Therefore, the volume of acid added (V) plus the volume of water added equals 100 cm³. Wait, but the problem states "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution". So the acid is added to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, then diluted to 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-express the problem.

Original problem: Dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume. What is the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed? So first, the acid is added to react with Fe(OH)3, and then the solution is made up to 100 cm³. So the total volume after dissolution is 100 cm³, which includes the acid solution and water.

Wait, but how? Let me clarify. To dissolve Fe(OH)3, you need to add acid. The amount of acid required is determined by the stoichiometry. The acid comes from a 0.1 M solution. The total solution volume after adding the acid and water is 100 cm³. Therefore, the volume of acid (V) plus the volume of water (W) equals 100 cm³. So V + W = 100 cm³.

But actually, when you mix acid and water, the volumes aren't strictly additive, but in such dilute solutions, we can assume they are. So first, calculate the moles of acid required (0.002807 mol), then the volume of 0.1 M acid solution is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. Then, the remaining volume is 100 - 28.07 = 71.93 cm³ of water. So the total solution is 100 cm³.

But then, once the acid is added (28.07 cm³) and diluted to 100 cm³, the concentration of Fe^3+ would be 9.356×10^-4 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.

But wait, the acid is first used to react with Fe(OH)3, and then the solution is diluted to 100 cm³. So all the Fe^3+ and the Cl- (if using HCl) are in 100 cm³ solution.

Wait, but the acid is monobasic, so HA. For example, if it's HCl, then the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O

So in this case, FeCl3 is soluble, and the Cl- is a spectator ion. The Fe^3+ will hydrolyze as mentioned earlier.

But after the reaction, all the acid is consumed, as we added the stoichiometric amount. So there's no excess H+ from the acid, only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Therefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions. Let's recast the problem with this in mind.

The concentration of Fe^3+ in the 100 cm³ solution is 0.009356 M. The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ will release H+ ions. As before, we can model this with the first hydrolysis step.

But maybe I need to use the hydrolysis constant (Khyd) or the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for the Fe(H2O)6^3+ ion. Fe^3+ in aqueous solution exists as the hexaaqua complex [Fe(H2O)6]^3+, which is a strong acid. The first hydrolysis step is:

[Fe(H2O)6]^3+ ↔ [Fe(H2O)5(OH)]^2+ + H+

The Ka for this reaction is approximately 6.7×10^-3, so pKa ≈ 2.17.

Given that the concentration of [Fe(H2O)6]^3+ is 0.009356 M, we can calculate the pH.

Let’s denote the concentration of H+ as x. The equilibrium expression is:

Ka = [H+][Fe(OH)]²+ / [Fe^3+]

Assuming x << 0.009356 initially, but given that Ka is 6.7×10^-3 and the concentration is low, this assumption may not hold. Let’s set up the equation.

Let [H+] = x = [Fe(OH)]²+

Then, Ka = x² / (0.009356 - x) = 6.7×10^-3

Again, we need to solve this quadratic equation:

x² + 6.7×10^-3 x - 6.7×10^-3 * 0.009356 = 0

Compute 6.7×10^-3 * 0.009356 ≈ 0.0000627

So, x² + 0.0067x - 0.0000627 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-0.0067 ± sqrt(0.0067^2 + 4*0.0000627)] / 2

Compute discriminant:

(0.0067)^2 = 0.00004489

4*0.0000627 = 0.0002508

Sum: 0.00004489 + 0.0002508 ≈ 0.00029569

sqrt(0.00029569) ≈ 0.0172

So,

x = [-0.0067 ± 0.0172]/2

Take the positive root:

x = (0.0105)/2 ≈ 0.00525 M

Therefore, [H+] ≈ 0.00525 M, so pH = -log10(0.00525) ≈ 2.28

But let's check if x is indeed 0.00525 M:

If x = 0.00525, then [Fe^3+] = 0.009356 - 0.00525 ≈ 0.004106 M

Ka = (0.00525)^2 / 0.004106 ≈ 0.00002756 / 0.004106 ≈ 0.00671, which is close to 6.7×10^-3. Hence, the calculation checks out.

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately 2.28.

Wait, but another way to approach this is by considering the formula for a weak acid:

For a weak acid with concentration C and Ka, the [H+] can be approximated by:

[H+] ≈ sqrt(Ka * C)

If Ka*C >> Kw, and Ka is not negligible compared to C.

In this case, C = 0.009356 M, Ka = 6.7×10^-3

Then, sqrt(6.7×10^-3 * 0.009356) ≈ sqrt(6.27×10^-5) ≈ 0.00792 M

But that gives a higher [H+] and lower pH. But this is the case when x << C, but in our previous calculation, x was 0.00525 M, which is over half of C (0.009356 M). Therefore, the approximation sqrt(Ka*C) isn't valid here. Hence, the quadratic solution is more accurate.

So pH ≈ 2.28, which is about 2.3.

But let me cross-verify. The pKa is approximately 2.17. If the solution was 0.1 M Fe^3+, then pH would be around (pKa - log C)/2 or something else?

Wait, maybe using the formula for a weak acid:

If we have a weak acid HA dissociating into H+ and A-, then for a solution of HA with concentration C, the pH can be found using:

[H+] = ( -Ka + sqrt(Ka^2 + 4KaC) ) / 2

Which is derived from the quadratic equation. In our case, Ka = 6.7×10^-3, C = 0.009356 M.

Plugging in:

[H+] = [ -0.0067 + sqrt(0.0067^2 + 4*0.0067*0.009356) ] / 2

Compute inside the sqrt:

0.00004489 + 4*0.0067*0.009356 ≈ 0.00004489 + 4*0.0000627 ≈ 0.00004489 + 0.0002508 ≈ 0.00029569

sqrt(0.00029569) ≈ 0.0172

Then,

[H+] = (-0.0067 + 0.0172)/2 ≈ 0.0105/2 ≈ 0.00525 M

Which matches the previous result. So pH ≈ 2.28.

Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.

But let's see if there's any other factor. For instance, after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution contains Fe^3+ and the conjugate base of the strong acid (e.g., Cl- if using HCl). Since the acid is strong, its conjugate base is non-basic and won't affect the pH. So the pH is solely determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.

But maybe we need to consider the activity coefficients or other hydrolysis steps? However, given that this is a textbook problem, and the first hydrolysis step is dominant, and the calculations lead to a pH around 2.3, that's likely the expected answer.

In summary:

- Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.0009356 mol
- Moles of acid needed: 0.002807 mol
- Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³
- Resulting Fe^3+ concentration: 0.009356 M
- pH due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis: ~2.28

Therefore, the minimum volume of acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the solution is approximately 2.28. Rounding appropriately, since the problem might expect two decimal places for pH, so 2.28, and the volume could be 28.1 cm³.

But let's check the exact calculation again for precision.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3:

Fe: 55.845 g/mol

O: 16.00 * 3 = 48.00 g/mol

H: 1.008 * 3 = 3.024 g/mol

Total: 55.845 + 48.00 + 3.024 = 106.869 g/mol

0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol

So, exactly 0.0009357 mol of Fe(OH)3.

Moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol

Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.

So, exactly 28.07 cm³. Depending on the required significant figures, since the given data is 0.1 g (two sig figs) and 0.1 M (two sig figs), the answer should be presented with two significant figures. So, 28 cm³ and pH 2.3.

But wait, 0.1 g is two significant figures, 0.1 M is two sig figs, so the volume would be 28 cm³ (two sig figs) and pH 2.3 (two decimal places but depends on sig figs). However, pH is a logarithmic measure, and the number after the decimal is significant. Since the calculation gave 2.28, which is approximately 2.3 when rounded to two significant figures. But typically, pH is reported with two decimal places. Wait, but the precision of the given data is two sig figs for the acid concentration and mass. Therefore, the pH should be given to two decimal places as well? Wait, no, the number of significant figures in pH is determined by the precision of the measurement. Since the input data has two sig figs, the pH can be reported with two decimal places but that’s a bit conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects two decimal places for pH regardless. Let's see.

But given that the calculation gives pH = 2.28, which is two decimal places. However, if we take into account the possible error in the given data, maybe it's 2.3. Alternatively, the exact answer might need to be more precise. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. Wait, but we added exactly the stoichiometric amount. So, if the acid is strong and monobasic, and we added 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, then all H+ is consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)3. So the only H+ present is from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Therefore, the pH is solely from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

In that case, as calculated, pH ≈ 2.28, which is approximately 2.3.

But perhaps in the problem, the intended answer uses the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 and works backward? Wait, but the question is about dissolving the Fe(OH)3 with acid, so the Ksp might not be directly needed here because adding acid consumes OH- ions, shifting the dissolution equilibrium.

But perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, consider the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in acidic solution. The dissolution reaction can be considered as:

Fe(OH)3 (s) + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

The equilibrium for this reaction can be related to the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 and the inverse of the water autoionization.

The solubility product Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3 (s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3OH-

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3

But when dissolving in acid, the H+ reacts with OH-:

H+ + OH- → H2O

Thus, the overall reaction combines these two:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [Fe^3+]/([H+]^3) = Ksp / Kw^3

Where Kw = 1×10^-14 at 25°C.

If we can calculate Ksp for Fe(OH)3, then we can find the required [H+] to dissolve 0.1 g in 100 cm³.

Wait, but the problem states that we want to dissolve 0.1 g in 100 cm³. The minimal amount of acid needed would be the stoichiometric amount required to neutralize the OH- ions from Fe(OH)3. However, in reality, due to Ksp, some H+ is needed to lower the [OH-] enough to keep Fe(OH)3 dissolved. But given that we are using a strong acid, and adding enough to completely neutralize the OH- ions (i.e., stoichiometric amount), the solution would be just sufficient to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. However, in practice, the Fe^3+ would hydrolyze as we considered earlier, producing H+.

But the question is asking for the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. If we only add the stoichiometric amount, then according to the reaction Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O, then the minimum acid needed is 3 moles H+ per mole Fe(OH)3. However, due to the subsequent hydrolysis of Fe^3+, which releases H+, but not OH-, the solution remains acidic. Therefore, the minimal acid needed is indeed the stoichiometric amount, and the pH is governed by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Therefore, the previous calculation is correct. Hence:

Minimum volume of acid: 28.07 cm³ (≈28.1 cm³)

pH of resulting solution: ≈2.28

But let me verify the Ksp approach. Suppose we use Ksp to check if after adding the acid, the solution is just saturated or not. But since we're adding a strong acid, which completely neutralizes the OH- from Fe(OH)3, and provides Fe^3+ in solution. Then, even if some Fe(OH)3 remains, but as we added enough acid to dissolve all of it (stoichiometric amount), theoretically, all Fe(OH)3 should dissolve. Hence, using stoichiometry is sufficient here.

In conclusion, the minimum volume of 0.1 M strong monobasic acid needed is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the solution is approximately 2.28.

But let's cross-check with actual literature values. The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6.3×10^-38. Wait, that seems extremely low. If Ksp is that small, then the solubility of Fe(OH)3 in neutral water is negligible. However, in acidic solution, the solubility increases as H+ consumes OH-.

But if Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3 = 6.3×10^-38

In solution, after adding H+, the [OH-] is determined by the pH. If we have a certain [Fe^3+], then [OH-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+])^(1/3)

But in this problem, we want [Fe^3+] = 0.1 g / (106.87 g/mol) / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M

So [Fe^3+] = 0.009356 M

Then [OH-] = (6.3×10^-38 / 0.009356)^(1/3)

Calculate numerator: 6.3×10^-38 / 0.009356 ≈ 6.73×10^-36

Then [OH-] = (6.73×10^-36)^(1/3) ≈ 1.88×10^-12 M

Then [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1×10^-14 / 1.88×10^-12 ≈ 5.34×10^-3 M

pH = -log(5.34×10^-3) ≈ 2.27

Which matches our previous calculation of pH ≈2.28. Therefore, this method also gives the same pH. Therefore, the pH is indeed approximately 2.27-2.28.

Therefore, the calculations are consistent.

So, summarizing:

To dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ solution, the stoichiometric amount of H+ needed is 0.002807 mol, which requires 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M strong acid. The resulting solution will have Fe^3+ at 0.009356 M, which hydrolyzes to give [H+] ≈5.34×10^-3 M, corresponding to pH ≈2.27.

Therefore, the minimum volume is approximately 28.1 cm³ and the pH is approximately 2.28.

Since the problem might require rounding to two significant figures, the volume is 28 cm³ and pH 2.3. However, given the precise calculation leading to 28.07 cm³ and pH 2.28, it's better to present the answers as 28.1 cm³ and pH 2.28. But since the data provided (0.1 g, 0.1 M) has two significant figures, the appropriate answers would be 28 cm³ and pH 2.3.

Alternatively, if the problem expects three significant figures for the volume (since 0.1 can be considered as one or two), but typically 0.1 is one significant figure, but in many contexts, trailing zeros after decimal are considered significant. Wait, 0.1 g and 0.1 M each have one significant figure, so the answers should have one significant figure. But 28.07 cm³ would round to 30 cm³ (one sig fig), and pH 2.3 (two sig figs). But this seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes two significant figures, given that 0.1 could be considered as having two if the precision is implied.

Alternatively, the answer might expect two decimal places for pH regardless of significant figures. In any case, given the context, it's more reasonable to present the volume as 28.1 cm³ (three sig figs) and pH as 2.28 (two decimal places). However, given the original data has two significant figures (0.1 g, 0.1 M), the answers should be to two significant figures. Therefore, 28 cm³ and pH 2.3.

But checking the exact moles:

0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol ≈ 9.36×10^-4 mol (three sig figs)

But since the given mass is 0.1 g (one sig fig), the moles would be one sig fig: 9×10^-4 mol. But perhaps the molar masses are precise, so 0.1 g is two sig figs (if it was 0.10 g, then two), but 0.1 is one. This complicates things.

If 0.1 g is one sig fig, then:

Moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 / 106.869 ≈ 0.00094 (one sig fig: 0.0009)

Moles H+ needed = 3*0.0009 = 0.0027

Volume acid = 0.0027 / 0.1 = 0.027 L = 27 cm³ (one sig fig: 30 cm³)

But this seems inconsistent. Alternatively, since the molar mass calculation uses more precise values, perhaps the number of significant figures is determined by the given data, which is 0.1 g (two sig figs? Sometimes decimal without a zero is considered one, but in some contexts, two). This is ambiguous. However, in many scientific contexts, 0.1 is considered one significant figure unless a trailing zero is added, like 0.10.

Assuming 0.1 g and 0.1 M are two significant figures (if written as 0.10, then two), but as written, they’re one. However, in some notation styles, 0.1 can be two sig figs if specified. Given the problem is from an unspecified source, but common practice, it's safer to assume two significant figures for 0.1 in such contexts. Hence, the answers would be 28 cm³ and pH 2.3.

Alternatively, the strict answer would be one sig fig: 30 cm³ and pH 2. But that seems too approximate.

Given that in the calculation, the molar mass was calculated to four decimal places, and the moles to four decimal places, but the given data is two significant figures, I think the appropriate answers are:

Volume: 28 cm³ (two sig figs)

pH: 2.3 (two sig figs)

Thus, the boxed answers would be:

Volume = \boxed{28} cm³

pH = \boxed{2.3}

But since the calculated volume was 28.07 cm³, which is 28.1 cm³ when rounded to three sig figs, but given the problem's data, 28 cm³ (two sig figs) and pH 2.3 (two sig figs) is appropriate.

**Final Answer**
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.3}.
