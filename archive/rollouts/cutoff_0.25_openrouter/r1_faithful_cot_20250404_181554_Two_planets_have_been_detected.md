# Original Question

Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the ratio of their orbital distances. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

Given that both planets have the same albedo \(A\), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find the ratio of the orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) shifts induced by each planet. The Doppler shift formula relates the velocity \(v\) to the wavelength shift \(\Delta \lambda\):

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v}{c}
\]

For both planets, the rest wavelength \(\lambda_0 = 6300\) Å. The velocities \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are calculated as follows:

\[
v_1 = \frac{0.03}{6300} \cdot c \quad \text{and} \quad v_2 = \frac{0.04}{6300} \cdot c
\]

The ratio of these velocities is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Using the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \(K\), the planet mass \(M_p\), and the semi-major axis \(a\):

\[
K = \sqrt{\frac{G M_p}{a M_*}}
\]

Solving for \(a\) gives:

\[
a = \frac{G M_p}{K^2 M_*}
\]

The ratio of the semi-major axes \(a_2/a_1\) is:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \cdot \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{7} \cdot \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{7} \cdot \frac{9}{16} = \frac{45}{112}
\]

Finally, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{45}{112}} = \frac{3}{4} \sqrt{\frac{5}{7}}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is:

\boxed{\dfrac{3}{4} \sqrt{\dfrac{5}{7}}}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's try to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Hmm, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity, right? And since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio. So, the key factors here are the luminosity of the star and the orbital distance of each planet.

Wait, but the problem doesn't directly give us the orbital distances. It gives the mass of the star and the radial velocity shifts. Maybe I need to use the radial velocity method to find the distances? Let's see.

The radial velocity method uses the Doppler shift caused by the gravitational pull of the planet on the star. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, is given by:

\[
K = \frac{28.4 \, \text{m/s}}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \left( \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_J} \right) \left( \frac{M_*}{M_\odot} \right)^{-1/2} \left( \frac{P}{\text{1 year}} \right)^{-1/3}
\]

But wait, the problem mentions the shift in the [OI] line as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2 respectively. The Doppler shift formula relates the velocity to the wavelength shift:

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v}{c}
\]

Where \(\Delta \lambda\) is the shift in wavelength, \(\lambda_0\) is the rest wavelength, and \(v\) is the velocity. Since they're using the same spectral line, \(\lambda_0 = 6300\) Å for both planets. Therefore, I can find the velocity for each planet using their respective wavelength shifts.

For Planet1: \(\Delta \lambda = 0.03\) Å.

So,

\[
v_1 = c \times \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times \frac{0.03}{6300}
\]

Similarly for Planet2: \(\Delta \lambda = 0.04\) Å,

\[
v_2 = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times \frac{0.04}{6300}
\]

Calculating these velocities:

Wait, 6300 Å is 6300 x 10^-10 meters. But actually, since we have \(\Delta \lambda\) and \(\lambda_0\) in the same units, they cancel out. So it's just the ratio. Let me compute this properly.

But remember, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star caused by the planet. The formula gives the velocity K in terms of the planet's mass, orbital period, star mass, etc. However, here they give the measured Doppler shifts. So perhaps the given \(\Delta \lambda\) values correspond to the velocity K for each planet? Since it says "periodic shift up to..." so maximum shift which would be K.

Therefore, velocity v (K) for each planet is:

For Planet1, \(v_1 = \frac{0.03}{6300} \times c\), same for Planet2, \(v_2 = \frac{0.04}{6300} \times c\). Since we need ratios, maybe the ratio of velocities would help in getting the ratio of orbital distances.

But the question is to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star (semi-major axis) and the star's luminosity.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \times \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} \times (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

Where \(A\) is the albedo, which is the same for both planets, so the ratio would be:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} / \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} } = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Wait, no. Let's check the formula again.

Actually, the equilibrium temperature (ignoring greenhouse effects and other factors) is:

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \sqrt{ \frac{R_*}{2a} } \left( \frac{L_*}{L_\odot} \right)^{1/4} } (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

Wait, perhaps better to recall the standard formula. The equilibrium temperature occurs when the absorbed stellar flux equals the emitted thermal radiation. The stellar flux at distance a is:

\[
F = \frac{L_*}{4 \pi a^2} (1 - A)
\]

The emitted flux from the planet (assuming blackbody emission):

\[
\sigma T_{eq}^4 = \frac{L_*}{4 \pi a^2} (1 - A)
\]

Therefore,

\[
T_{eq}^4 = \frac{L_* (1 - A)}{16 \pi \sigma a^2}
\]

But the luminosity of the star is related to its radius and effective temperature:

\[
L_* = 4 \pi R_*^2 \sigma T_{eff}^4
\]

Substituting that into the equation for \( T_{eq} \):

\[
T_{eq}^4 = \frac{4 \pi R_*^2 \sigma T_{eff}^4 (1 - A)}{16 \pi \sigma a^2} } = \frac{R_*^2 T_{eff}^4 (1 - A)}{4 a^2}
\]

Thus,

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2 a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

Yes, so since albedo is the same, ratio of temperatures becomes:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{R_*/ (2 a_1)}{ R_* / (2 a_2)}} } = \sqrt{ \frac{a_2}{a_1} }
\]

Wait, no. Let me take the ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{ T_{eff} \sqrt{ \frac{ R_* }{ 2 a_1 } } (1 - A)^{1/4} }{ T_{eff} \sqrt{ \frac{ R_* }{ 2 a_2 } } (1 - A)^{1/4} } } = \sqrt{ \frac{a_2}{a_1} }
\]

Exactly. So it's sqrt(a2/a1). So we need the ratio of their orbital distances. So my task is to find a_1 and a_2. Oh, but how?

But we can relate the orbital distance to the star's radial velocity. Let's think. The Doppler shift (K) is related to the planet's mass, but also to the orbital distance via Kepler's laws.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

\[
K = \frac{2 \pi G}{P} \frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_* + M_p)^{2/3} } \frac{1}{(1 - e^2)^{1/2}} }
\]

But this might be getting complicated, since we don't know the inclination angle i or the period P. But perhaps since the problem states that both planets have been detected with both transit and RV methods, we can perhaps assume that we can use the information from RV to relate mass and distance. Wait, but the thing is, perhaps we can get the semi-major axis from the RV measurements.

Alternatively, since we know the star's mass, and via the RV method, the velocity amplitude K relates to the planet's orbital parameters.

Recall that the RV semi-amplitude for the star's velocity is:

For a circular orbit, K is given by:

\[
K = \left( \frac{2 \pi G}{P} \right)^{1/3} \frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_* + M_p)^{2/3}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}}
\]

But since they are circular orbits, e = 0, so that term is 1. However, we still have the sin i term. But since the planets are observed via transit method, that requires that the inclination i ≈ 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1. Thus, for transiting planets, we can take sin i = 1, so this term is accounted for.

Therefore, K simplifies to:

\[
K = \left( \frac{2 \pi G}{P} \right)^{1/3} \frac{M_p}{(M_* + M_p)^{2/3}}
\]

But also, from Kepler's third law:

\[
P^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 a^3}{G(M_* + M_p)}
\]

Hence,

\[
\frac{2 \pi}{P} = \left( \frac{G(M_* + M_p)}{a^3} \right)^{1/2}
\]

So substituting into K:

\[
K = \left( \frac{G(M_* + M_p)}{a^3} \right)^{1/3} \frac{M_p}{(M_* + M_p)^{2/3}}}
= \frac{ G^{1/3} (M_* + M_p)^{1/3} }{ a } \times \frac{ M_p }{ (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} } }
= \frac{ G^{1/3} M_p }{ a (M_* + M_p)^{1/3} }
\]

Hmm, not sure if this is useful yet. Maybe express a in terms of K and planet mass?

Alternatively, since we have the velocity K from the Doppler shift, which we can calculate from the given wavelength shifts.

Earlier, the Doppler shift gives us K for each planet. So, let's compute K for each planet first.

The problem gives the Doppler shift in Angstroms for the [OI] line at 6300 A. So, for Planet1: delta_lambda1 = 0.03 A, Planet2: 0.04 A.

Because the Doppler shift formula is:

delta_lambda / lambda_0 = v / c

So, solving for v:

v = delta_lambda / lambda_0 * c

We can plug in the values:

For Planet1:

v1 = 0.03 / 6300 * c

Similarly, Planet2:

v2 = 0.04 / 6300 * c

We can compute these as velocities.

But perhaps even better to compute in terms of ratios.

But to keep it in formula terms, let me see:

K1 = 0.03 / 6300 * c

K2 = 0.04 / 6300 * c

So K2/K1 = 0.04 / 0.03 = 4/3

But is that ratio important?

But perhaps we need to find the semi-major axes(a1 and a2), to compute sqrt( a2/a1 )

Alternatively, from Kepler's third law and the radial velocity relation.

Let's recall that Kepler's third law:

P^2 = (4 π^2 / G(M* + Mp)) a^3

But for exoplanets, since M* >> Mp, we can simplify to:

P^2 ≈ (4 π^2 / G M*) a^3

So, P = 2 π sqrt( a^3 / ( G M* ) )

Then, the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (2 π G / P)^{1/3} ( Mp sin i / (M* + Mp)^{2/3} )

But for sin i ≈ 1 (transiting planets), and M* >> Mp, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( G / (P M*^2 ))^{1/3 } Mp

So pulling P from the Kepler's third law into the equation,

P = 2 π a^(3/2) / sqrt( G M* )

Substitute this into K:

K ≈ ( G / ( ( 2 π a^(3/2) / sqrt( G M* ) ) * M*^2 ) ) )^(1/3 ) Mp

Wait, perhaps it's messy. Let's do step by step.

Express K in terms of a and M*, using Kepler's law.

Let me first plug P from Kepler's law into the expression for K.

From K = (2 π G / P )^{1/3} * (Mp / M*^{2/3} )

From Kepler's law:

P = 2 π ( a^3 / ( G M* ) )^{1/2 }

So, 1/P = ( G M* )^{1/2 } / ( 2 π a^{3/2} )

Thus,

(2 π G / P )^{1/3} = [ 2 π G * ( G M* )^{1/2} / ( 2 π a^{3/2} ) ) ]^{1/3 }

Simplify inside the brackets:

2 π cancels numerator and denominator:

G * ( G M* )^{1/2 } / a^{3/2 }

= G^{ 3/2 } M*^{1/2 } / a^{ 3/2 }

So:

( G^{3/2 } M*^{1/2 } / a^{3/2 } )^{1/3 } = G^{1/2 } M*^{1/6 } / a^{1/2 }

Therefore, K becomes:

K = (G^{1/2 } M*^{1/6 } / a^{1/2 }) * ( Mp / M*^{2/3} )

Multiply terms:

= G^{1/2 } M*^{1/6 - 2/3 } Mp / a^{1/2 }

= G^{1/2 } M*^{-1/2 } Mp / a^{1/2 }

So,

K = ( G Mp / ( a M* ) )^{1/2 }

Thus,

K = sqrt( G Mp / (a M* ) )

Therefore, we can write:

K = \sqrt{ \frac{ G Mp }{ a M* } }

Rearranging, solve for a:

a = \frac{ G Mp }{ K^2 M* }

So, the semi-major axis is inversely proportional to the square of the velocity semi-amplitude K and directly proportional to mass of planet.

But let's check the formula again.

Wait, let me verify.

If I square both sides of K = sqrt( G Mp / (a M* ) ), I get K² = G Mp / ( a M* )

Thus, solving for a:

a = G Mp / ( K² M* )

Hence, for each planet:

a1 = G Mp1 / ( K1² M* )

a2 = G Mp2 / ( K2² M* )

Therefore, the ratio of the semi-major axes:

a1 / a2 = ( Mp1 / K1² ) / ( Mp2 / K2² ) ) = ( Mp1 / Mp2 ) * ( K2² / K1² )

But since we need the ratio sqrt( a2 / a1 ) for the temperature ratio, since Teq1 / Teq2 = sqrt(a2/a1)

Let me compute the ratio a2 / a1:

a2 / a1 = (Mp2 / (K2² M* )) / ( Mp1 / ( K1² M* )) ) = ( Mp2 / Mp1 ) * ( K1² / K2² )

Therefore,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( (Mp2 / Mp1 ) * ( K1² / K2² ) ) = sqrt( Mp2 / Mp1 ) * ( K1 / K2 )

Substitute Mp1 = 7 Earth masses, Mp2 = 5 Earth masses, K1 and K2.

Earlier, for K, since K1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, K2 = (0.04 /6300) *c. Therefore, K1 / K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4

Thus,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( (5 / 7 ) ) * ( 3/4 )

Let me compute this:

sqrt(5/7) is approx sqrt(0.714) ≈ 0.845

0.845 * 0.75 = 0.634

So approximately 0.634, so the ratio would be T1/T2 ≈ 0.63. But let me compute it more precisely.

sqrt(5/7):

5 /7 ≈ 0.71428571

sqrt(0.71428571) ≈ 0.84515425

0.84515425 * (3/4) = 0.84515425 * 0.75 ≈ 0.63386569

So approximately 0.634.

Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio is T1/T2≈0.634, or as a fraction,  sqrt(5/7)*(3/4) which exact is (3/4)*sqrt(5/7)

But we need to write the answer as a ratio. Perhaps we can rationalize it.

But is there another approach? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake here. Let's retrace.

I think the confusion arises from the relation between K and a. Let's look back.

We had, from the derivation, a = G Mp / ( K^2 M* )

But the units here might be off. Wait, perhaps that derivation was wrong.

Wait, formula for velocity K (semi-amplitude) in terms of orbital elements. Let's use the Keplerian relation again. Let me check a standard formula.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = \left( \frac{G}{2 \pi} \right)^{1/3} \frac{(M_p \sin i)}{(M_* + M_p)^{2/3}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \frac{2 \pi}{P}

Wait, maybe I need to refer to the standard formula.

According to Wikipedia, the RV semi-amplitude is:

\[
K = \sqrt{\frac{G}{1 - e^2}} \frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_* + M_p)^{2/3}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \frac{1}{a^{1/2}}}
\]

Wait, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, considering the basic physics. The velocity of the star around the barycenter is given by:

v* = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) * v_p

And the planet's velocity is:

v_p = sqrt( G (M_* + M_p) / a )

So,

v* = (M_p / (M_* + M_p)) * sqrt( G (M_* + M_p)/a ) = M_p sqrt( G ) / sqrt( a (M_* + M_p) )

Assuming M_* >> M_p, simplifies to:

v* ≈ sqrt( G / a M_* ) * M_p

Thus,

K = v* = ( G M_p )^(1/2) / ( M_* a )^(1/2 ) )

Which is the same as before:

K = sqrt( ( G M_p ) / ( a M_* ) )

Which rearranged for a gives:

a = ( G M_p ) / ( K^2 M_* )

Therefore, my prior derivation seems correct. Thus this relation is valid.

Thus, plug in masses, K for each planet to get semi-major axes.

Given:

M* = 1.5 M_sun

But G and M_sun will cancel in ratios. Let's write the ratio a2 / a1.

As earlier,

a1 = ( G M_p1 ) / ( K1^2 M* )

a2 = ( G M_p2 ) / ( K2^2 M* )

Ratio a2/a1 = ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * ( K1^2 / K2^2 )

Thus,

a2/a1 = (5 /7) * ( ( K1 / K2 )^2 )

But K1/K2 is ( (delta1 / lambda) / (delta2 / lambda) ) = delta1/delta2 = 0.03 /0.04 = 3/4

Thus,

( K1 / K2 )² = 9/16

Therefore,

a2/a1 = (5/7) * (9/16 ) = (45 / 112 )

Thus,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 /a1 ) = sqrt(45/112 )

But wait, so that would make T1 / T2 = sqrt(45/112 )

Compute that:

45/112 = 0.401785714

sqrt(0.401785714 ) ≈ 0.634

Which is the same as before, ~0.634

But wait, possibly. Hmm.

But how come?

Wait, so the ratio is T1/T2 = sqrt( (Mp2 / Mp1 ) * ( K1/K2 )² )

Hmm, okay.

But given that when I plugged in the ratios into the code, yeah. So either approx 0.634 or exact answer sqrt(45 / 112 ), which simplifies to:

sqrt(45 / 112) = 3*sqrt(5/112)/sqrt(45) replaced?

Wait, 45 = 9*5, 112=16*7. so:

sqrt(45/112 )= sqrt(9*5/(16*7))= (3/4)*sqrt(5/7)

Exactly! Because sqrt(9/16) = 3/4, then sqrt(5/7) remains.

Therefore,

T1 / T2 = (3/4) * sqrt(5/7 )

So the ratio is (3/4) multiplied by sqrt(5/7).

This is the exact expression. To write it as a ratio, perhaps we can rationalize.

But likely, the answer can be presented as \boxed{ \frac{3}{4} \sqrt{ \frac{5}{7} } }

Alternatively, perhaps rationalized:

Multiply numerator and denominator inside the sqrt:

sqrt(5/7) = sqrt(35)/7

But that may not be necessary. The given form is okay.

But the problem states to give the ratio. So possible answers could be left in terms of those radicals or decimal. But since the answer might prefer exact symbolically, I think retaining the radicals is better.

So，

T1:T2 = 3*sqrt(5/7)/4

Thus,

\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{3}{4} \sqrt{ \frac{5}{7} }

But sometimes, combining:

= \sqrt{ \frac{9 \times 5}{16 \times 7} } = \sqrt{ \frac{45}{112} }

But either form is acceptable. Maybe the first form is better.

Alternatively, but the problem could also have testing if we use gravitational impact information.

Wait, we assumed that the Doppler shift gives the semi-amplitude K. But did we get correctly that K is related to the velocity via delta lambda = (K / c ) * lambda0?

Yes, the Doppler shift equation:

delta_lambda / lambda0 = v /c

Hence, v = c * delta_lambda / lambda0

Therefore, that's how we get K. Given that maximum shift is 0.03 and 0.04 A, then max velocity would be 0.03/6300 *c and same for Planet2.

But given that the star's velocity K is proportional to Mp / ( sqrt( a M* ) ), and thereby we derived a in terms of Mp and K.

Hence, given all that, then the ratio is correct.

Thus, the final answer is T1 / T2 = (3/4) * sqrt(5/7 )

But to make it as a fraction.

Alternatively, rationalizing,

3/4 * sqrt(5)/sqrt(7) = (3 sqrt(5)) / (4 sqrt(7))))) but it's customary to rationalize radicals. Then multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(7):

= (3 sqrt(35)) / 28

So,

T1 / T2 = 3 sqrt(35) / 28

But sqrt(35) ≈ 5.916, but perhaps they prefer to keep it symbolic.

Therefore,

Either \boxed{\dfrac{3}{4} \sqrt{\dfrac{5}{7}}} or \boxed{\dfrac{3 \sqrt{35}}{28}} ?

But in most textbooks and exams, the former is acceptable since it's simpler. Unless the answer requires rationalizing denominators.

In the problem statement, there is no specific preference given. Hence, both answers might be correct, but the first form is better: (3/4)√(5/7). Thus, let's go with that.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is \boxed{\dfrac{3}{4} \sqrt{\dfrac{5}{7}}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's try to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Hmm, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity, right? And since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio. So, the key factors here are the luminosity of the star and the orbital distance of each planet.

Wait, but the problem doesn't directly give us the orbital distances. It gives the mass of the star and the radial velocity shifts. Maybe I need to use the radial velocity method to find the distances? Let's see.

The radial velocity method uses the Doppler shift caused by the gravitational pull of the planet on the star. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, is given by:

\[
K = \frac{28.4 \, \text{m/s}}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \left( \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_J} \right) \left( \frac{M_*}{M_\odot} \right)^{-1/2} \left( \frac{P}{\text{1 year}} \right)^{-1/3}
\]

But wait, the problem mentions the shift in the [OI] line as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2 respectively. The Doppler shift formula relates the velocity to the wavelength shift:

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v}{c}
\]

Where \(\Delta \lambda\) is the shift in wavelength, \(\lambda_0\) is the rest wavelength, and \(v\) is the velocity. Since they're using the same spectral line, \(\lambda_0 = 6300\) Å for both planets. Therefore, I can find the velocity for each planet using their respective wavelength shifts.

For Planet1: \(\Delta \lambda = 0.03\) Å.

So,

\[
v_1 = c \times \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times \frac{0.03}{6300}
\]

Similarly for Planet2: \(\Delta \lambda = 0.04\) Å,

\[
v_2 = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times \frac{0.04}{6300}
\]

Calculating these velocities:

Wait, 6300 Å is 6300 x 10^-10 meters. But actually, since we have \(\Delta \lambda\) and \(\lambda_0\) in the same units, they cancel out. So it's just the ratio. Let me compute this properly.

But remember, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star caused by the planet. The formula gives the velocity K in terms of the planet's mass, orbital period, star mass, etc. However, here they give the measured Doppler shifts. So perhaps the given \(\Delta \lambda\) values correspond to the velocity K for each planet? Since it says "periodic shift up to..." so maximum shift which would be K.

Therefore, velocity v (K) for each planet is:

For Planet1, \(v_1 = \frac{0.03}{6300} \times c\), same for Planet2, \(v_2 = \frac{0.04}{6300} \times c\). Since we need ratios, maybe the ratio of velocities would help in getting the ratio of orbital distances.

But the question is to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star (semi-major axis) and the star's luminosity.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \times \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} \times (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

Where \(A\) is the albedo, which is the same for both planets, so the ratio would be:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} / \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} } = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Wait, no. Let's check the formula again.

Actually, the equilibrium temperature (ignoring greenhouse effects and other factors) is:

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \sqrt{ \frac{R_*}{2a} } \left( \frac{L_*}{L_\odot} \right)^{1/4} } (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

Wait, perhaps better to recall the standard formula. The equilibrium temperature occurs when the absorbed stellar flux equals the emitted thermal radiation. The stellar flux at distance a is:

\[
F = \frac{L_*}{4 \pi a^2} (1 - A)
\]

The emitted flux from the planet (assuming blackbody emission):

\[
\sigma T_{eq}^4 = \frac{L_*}{4 \pi a^2} (1 - A)
\]

Therefore,

\[
T_{eq}^4 = \frac{L_* (1 - A)}{16 \pi \sigma a^2}
\]

But the luminosity of the star is related to its radius and effective temperature:

\[
L_* = 4 \pi R_*^2 \sigma T_{eff}^4
\]

Substituting that into the equation for \( T_{eq} \):

Alright, I'll attempt to determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Equilibrium temperature is primarily determined by the star's luminosity and the planet's orbital distance. Since both planets have identical albedo values, this factor will cancel out when calculating their temperature ratio.

I notice the problem doesn't explicitly provide orbital distances, but instead gives the star's mass and radial velocity shifts. I may need to derive the distances using the radial velocity method.

The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift caused by a planet's gravitational effect on its star. The formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

\[
K = \frac{28.4 \, \text{m/s}}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \left( \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_J} \right) \left( \frac{M_*}{M_\odot} \right)^{-1/2} \left( \frac{P}{\text{1 year}} \right)^{-1/3}
\]

I see the problem mentions shifts in the [OI] spectral line of 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. Using the Doppler shift relationship:

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v}{c}
\]

Where Δλ represents wavelength shift, λ₀ is the rest wavelength (6300 Å in this case), and v is velocity. I can calculate the velocity for each planet based on their wavelength shifts.

For Planet1 with Δλ = 0.03 Å:
\[
v_1 = c \times \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times \frac{0.03}{6300}
\]

For Planet2 with Δλ = 0.04 Å:
\[
v_2 = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times \frac{0.04}{6300}
\]

Although 6300 Å equals 6300 × 10^-10 meters, the units cancel out since both Δλ and λ₀ are expressed in the same unit.

Since the problem mentions "periodic shift up to...", these shifts likely represent the maximum values, corresponding to the radial velocity semi-amplitude K for each planet.

To determine equilibrium temperatures, I'll use the relationship between absorbed stellar flux and emitted thermal radiation. The stellar flux at distance a is:

\[
F = \frac{L_*}{4 \pi a^2} (1 - A)
\]

For a planet emitting as a blackbody:

\[
\sigma T_{eq}^4 = \frac{L_*}{4 \pi a^2} (1 - A)
\]

Therefore:

\[
T_{eq}^4 = \frac{L_* (1 - A)}{16 \pi \sigma a^2}
\]

The star's luminosity relates to its radius and effective temperature through:

\[
L_* = 4 \pi R_*^2 \sigma T_{eff}^4

Certainly! Here's the paraphrased version of the text:

Alright, let's attempt to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Equilibrium temperature is influenced by the distance from the star and the star's luminosity, correct? Since both planets have identical albedo, that factor cancels out in the ratio calculation. Therefore, the crucial elements here are the star's luminosity and the orbital distance of each planet.

However, the problem doesn't provide the orbital distances directly. Instead, it gives the star's mass and the radial velocity shifts. Could it be that I need to employ the radial velocity method to calculate the distances? Let's explore this.

The radial velocity method utilizes the Doppler shift induced by the gravitational pull of the planet on the star. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude, \( K \), is expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{28.4 \, \text{m/s}}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}} \left( \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_J} \right) \left( \frac{M_*}{M_\odot} \right)^{-1/2} \left( \frac{P}{\text{1 year}} \right)^{-1/3}
\]

But hold on, the problem specifies the shift in the [OI] line as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. The Doppler shift formula relates the velocity to the wavelength shift as follows:

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v}{c}
\]

Where \(\Delta \lambda\) is the change in wavelength, \(\lambda_0\) is the rest wavelength, and \(v\) is the velocity. Given that they utilize the same spectral line, \(\lambda_0 = 6300\) Å for both planets. This enables calculating the velocity for each planet based on their respective wavelength shifts.

For Planet1: \(\Delta \lambda = 0.03\) Å.

Thus,

\[
v_1 = c \times \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times \frac{0.03}{6300}
\]

Similarly, for Planet2: \(\Delta \lambda = 0.04\) Å,

\[
v_2 = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times \frac{0.04}{6300}
\]

Upon computing these velocities:

Wait a moment, 6300 Å equates to 6300 x 10^-10 meters. But since both \(\Delta \lambda\) and \(\lambda_0\) are in the same units, they effectively cancel out in ratio calculations. Let's compute this accurately.

However, remember, the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) denotes the velocity of the star prompted by the planet. The given formula expresses the velocity \( K \) in terms of the planet's mass, orbital period, star mass, etc. Yet, here, the measured Doppler shifts are provided. Perhaps the provided \(\Delta \lambda\) values correspond to the velocity \( K \) for each planet? Since it specifies "periodic shift up to..." indicating maximum shift represented by \( K \).

Therefore, the velocity \( v \) (or \( K \)) for each planet is:

For Planet1, \(v_1 = \frac{0.03}{6300} \times c\), similarly for Planet2, \(v_2 = \frac{0.04}{6300} \times c\). Since ratios are needed, maybe the velocity ratio assists in determining the ratio of orbital distances.

Nonetheless, the question pertains to finding the ratio of equilibrium temperatures. Equilibrium temperature hinges on the distance from the star (semi-major axis) and the star's luminosity.

The equation for equilibrium temperature is:

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \times \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} \times (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

Where \(A\) is the albedo, consistent for both planets, so the ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a_1}} / \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Hold on, let's verify the formula again.

In fact, the equilibrium temperature (excluding greenhouse effects and other factors) is represented as:

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \sqrt{ \frac{R_*}{2a} } \left( \frac{L_*}{L_\odot} \right)^{1/4} (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

Let's recall the standard formula more accurately. Equilibrium temperature occurs when the absorbed stellar flux balances the emitted thermal radiation. The stellar flux at distance \( a \) is:

\[
F = \frac{L_*}{4 \pi a^2} (1 - A)
\]

The flux emitted by the planet (assuming blackbody radiation) is:

\[
\sigma T_{eq}^4 = \frac{L_*}{4 \pi a^2} (1 - A)
\]

This leads to:

\[
T_{eq}^4 = \frac{L_* (1 - A)}{16 \pi \sigma a^2}
\]

The star's luminosity correlates to its radius and effective temperature as follows:

\[
L_* = 4 \pi R_*^2 \sigma T_{eff}^4
\]

Substituting this into the equation for \( T_{eq} \):

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances (a2/a1). Wait, but more precisely, it's the inverse square root: a_2 over a_1 inside the square root. So if a_2 is larger, then the temperature ratio is sqrt(a_2/a_1), which would make T1/T2 larger if a_2 > a_1.\n\nBut to get a_1 and a_2, we need to relate the radial velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital distance.\n\nWait, radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\nFor a planet orbiting a star, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:\n\n\\[\nK = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{ M_p \\sin i }{ (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} } \\frac{1}{c}\n\\]\n\nWait, but that's perhaps complicating. Alternatively, we have another version of the formula. The relation between the semi-major axis, a, orbital period P, and the stellar mass.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[\nP^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G (M_* + M_p)}\n\\]\n\nBut if the planet's mass is much less than the star's mass (which is usually the case, and even 7 Earth masses is much less than 1.5 solar masses), so M_* >> M_p, so we can approximate it as:\n\n\\[\nP^2 \\approx \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G M_*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\na^3 = \\frac{ G M_* P^2 }{4 \\pi^2 }\n\\]\n\nSo a is related to P and M_*. But we don't know P for either planet.\n\nAlternatively, from the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{ (2 \\pi G)^{1/3} }{ (1 + M_p/M_*)^{1/3} } \\frac{ M_p \\sin i }{ M_*^{2/3} } \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{1}{P^{1/3} }\n\\]\n\nBut since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nK \\approx \\frac{ (2 \\pi G)^{1/3} }{ } \\frac{ M_p \\sin i }{ M_*^{2/3} } \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{1}{P^{1/3} }\n\\]\n\nBut this seems complex to use without knowing the orbital period P.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the measured Doppler shift gives us K, which is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. Then the mass of the planet is related to K, P, and the stellar mass.\n\nBut perhaps if we can express a in terms of K and the mass and then proceed. This might get tangled. Let's try.\n\nFrom the radial velocity equation, considering M_p << M_*, and assuming sin i = 1 (since they detected both planets, likely edge-on orbits, which is required for transit method. Since both transits and RV are used, inclination is edge-on, so sin i = 1.\n\nSo, K is:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{212.9 \\times (M_p / M_J) }{ (M_* / M_\\odot)^{1/2} } \\times \\frac{1}{ (a / \\text{1 AU})^{1/2} } } \\, \\text{m/s}\n\\]\n\nWait, maybe. Another version of the formula. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, in natural units, the formula is sometimes expressed as:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{ (M_p \\sin i) }{ (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} } \\times \\frac{ 2 \\pi G }{ (P c) }^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nBut again, P is needed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the Doppler shift gives us K, which is related to the planet's mass and orbital parameters.\n\nWait, I think the missing piece here is that if you have two planets detected by radial velocity, the ratio of their velocities (K1 and K2) can be related to the ratio of their masses and orbital distances.\n\nBut in our case, the problem gives the Doppler shift as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. So we can compute the ratio of K1 and K2 (which is v1 and v2 in terms of velocity). So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \\frac{0.03}{6300} \\times \\frac{6300}{0.04} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75\n\\]\n\nSo K1 = 0.75 K2.\n\nBut K is the semi-amplitude which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital parameters.\n\nUsing the radial velocity formula, for each planet:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{ (2 \\pi G)^{1/3} }{ (M_*)^{2/3} } \\frac{ M_p \\sin i }{ } \\frac{1}{(1 + M_p/M_*)^{1/3}} \\frac{1}{P^{1/3} c}\n\\]\n\nAssuming M_p << M_*, and sin i = 1, then:\n\n\\[\nK \\approx \\frac{ (2 \\pi G)^{1/3} }{ (M_*)^{2/3} } \\frac{ M_p }{ } \\frac{1}{P^{1/3} c}\n\\]\n\nBut if we take the ratio K1/K2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\left( \\frac{ M_{p1} }{ M_{p2} } \\right) \\left( \\frac{ P_2 }{ P_1 } \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nBut since P is related to a via Kepler's law:\n\n\\[\nP^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 a^3}{G M_* }\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nP_1^2 \\propto a_1^3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P_2^2 \\propto a_2^3\n\\]\n\nHence,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the K ratio,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \\left( \\frac{ (a_2 / a_1)^{3/2} }{ 1 } \\right)^{1/3} } = \\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\nGiven that we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = 0.75, \\quad \\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n0.75 = 1.4 \\times \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{0.75}{1.4} \\approx 0.5357\n\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (0.5357)^2 \\approx 0.287\n\n\\]\n\nWait, so a2 = 0.287 a1? That seems Planet2 is closer in than Planet1. But if the equilibrium temperature ratio is \\(\\sqrt{a_2/a1}\\), which would be sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.5357. So T1/T2 ≈ 0.5357. Thus, Planet1 is colder than Planet2. But wait, this seems conflicting with the individual characteristics. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up:\n\nIf \\(\\frac{a_2}{a_1} ≈ 0.287\\), that means a2 is smaller than a1, right? Since a2/a1 is 0.287, so a1 is larger. So Planet2 is closer to the star, thus should have a higher equilibrium temperature. Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536. So Planet1's temperature is 0.536 times Planet2's temperature.\n\nBut let's verify the calculations again step by step.\n\nGiven:\n\n- K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75\n\n- Mass ratio Mp1/Mp2 =7/5=1.4\n\nFrom the radial velocity formula ratio:\n\nK1/K2 = (Mp1/Mp2) * (P2/P1)^{1/3} \n\nBut P2/P1 = (a2/a1)^{3/2}\n\nThus,\n\nK1/K2 = (Mp1/Mp2) * (a2/a1)^{1/2}\n\nSubstitute 0.75 = 1.4 * (a2/a1)^{0.5}\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a2/a1)^{0.5} = 0.75 /1.4 ≈ 0.5357\n\nSquaring both sides,\n\na2/a1 ≈ 0.287\n\nTherefore, a2 ≈ 0.287 a1. Hence, Planet2 is closer to the star (smaller a2 than a1), a2 < a1.\n\nThus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:\n\nTe1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287)=≈ 0.536\n\nSo, Planet1 is about 0.536 times the temperature of Planet2.\n\nBut wait, let's check the formula again. The equilibrium temperature:\n\nT_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)\n\nSince the formula is T = T_eff * sqrt( R*/(2a) )\n\nHence, T1 / T2 = sqrt( R*/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R*/(2a2) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nTherefore, the ratio is sqrt(a2 / a1) ≈ 0.536\n\nHence, the ratio T1/T2 ≈ 0.536. So, to give the ratio, it's approximately 0.536, so but we need to present it as a fraction.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an arithmetic error:\n\nGiven:\n\n(a2 /a1) = (0.75 /1.4 )^2\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\n0.75 divided by 1.4. 1.4 is 7/5, so 0.75 / (7/5) = 0.75 * 5 /7 = 3/4 *5/7 =15/28 ≈ 0.5357. Then squared is (15/28)^2 = 225 /784 ≈0.287.\n\nSo indeed, the ratio a2/a1=225/784.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(a2/a1)=15/28 ≈0.5357\n\nThus, the ratio of T1/T2 is 15/28, which is 0.5357. So expressed as a fraction, it's 15/28.\n\nBut 15 and 28 have a common divisor of 1, so 15/28 cannot be simplified. So the answer is 15/28. Is that the simplest form?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects more precise steps. Let me think again if I missed anything.\n\nWait, let's check. Another approach to get a.\n\nAlternatively, from Radial velocity semi-amplitude equation:\n\nK = (v) = (2πG / (Pc))^{1/3} * (Mp sin i) / (M_* + Mp)^{2/3}\n\nBut given that both planets are detected by transit and RV, the inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. Also, M_* >> Mp, so (M_* + Mp) ≈ M_*. Then:\n\nK ≈ (2πG / (Pc))^{1/3} * (Mp) / M_*^{2/3}\n\nBut P is from Kepler's law: P^2 = (4π²/GM_*) a^3 → P = (4π² a^3 / (GM_*))^{1/2}\n\nSubstitute P into K:\n\nK ≈ (2πG / ( (4π² a^3 / (GM_*))^{1/2} *c ))^{1/3} * (Mp) / M_*^{2/3}\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me compute step-wise.\n\nFirst, express P in terms of a.\n\nP = sqrt(4π² a^3/(GM_*)) = (4π²/(G M_*))^{1/2} a^{3/2}\n\nSo, substitute into K:\n\nK = [2πG / ( (4π²/(G M_*))^{1/2} a^{3/2} c ) ]^{1/3} * (Mp) / M_*^{2/3}\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n2πG / ( (4π²/(G M_*))^{1/2} a^{3/2} c ) = 2πG / ( (4π²)^{1/2} (G M_*)^{-1/2} a^{3/2} c )\n\n= 2πG / (2 π (G M_*)^{-1/2} a^{3/2} c )\n\nCanceling 2π:\n\n= G / ( (G M_*)^{-1/2} a^{3/2} c )\n\n= G * (G M_*)^{1/2} / (a^{3/2} c )\n\n= G^{3/2} M_*^{1/2} / ( a^{3/2} c )\n\nTherefore, K is now:\n\n[ G^{3/2} M_*^{1/2} / ( a^{3/2} c ) ]^{1/3} * ( Mp ) / M_*^{2/3}\n\nSimplify exponent:\n\nG^{(3/2 * 1/3)} = G^{1/2}\n\nSimilarly, M_*^{(1/2 * 1/3)} = M_*^{1/6}\n\nDenominator: a^{(3/2 * 1/3)} = a^{1/2}, c^{1/3}\n\nThus, numerator terms when combining:\n\nG^{1/2} M_*^{1/6} / (a^{1/2} c^{1/3} ) * Mp / M_*^{2/3} )\n\n= G^{1/2} M_*^{1/6 - 2/3} Mp / (a^{1/2} c^{1/3} )\n\n= G^{1/2} M_*^{-1/2} Mp / (a^{1/2} c^{1/3} )\n\nTherefore, K = (G^{1/2} Mp)/( M_*^{1/2} a^{1/2} c^{1/3} )\n\nBut this is getting even more complicated. Perhaps we can write K in terms of a.\n\nBut given that, for both planets, we can write K1 and K2:\n\nK1 = (G^{1/2} M_p1)/( M_*^{1/2} a1^{1/2} c^{1/3} )\n\nK2 = (G^{1/2} M_p2)/( M_*^{1/2} a2^{1/2} c^{1/3} )\n\nTaking the ratio K1/K2:\n\n= (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * (a2 / a1)^{1/2}\n\nWhich gets us back to the same ratio as before. Therefore, the ratio of K's is (Mp1/Mp2) * sqrt(a2/a1)\n\nSo going back, that's where we came from.\n\nHence, confirming the earlier result. So the calculations seem okay.\n\nSo, after the algebra, we have:\n\nT1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ 15/28 ≈ 0.5357\n\nSo this should be the ratio.\n\nBut let me cross-validate with another perspective. If their RV signals are 0.75 times each other, and mass ratio is 1.4. Then the product (Mp1/K1) and (Mp2/K2) relates to the sqrt(a). Wait, perhaps another way.\n\nWait, rearrange the ratio K1/K2 = (Mp1 / Mp2) * sqrt(a2/a1)\n\nRewrite:\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = (K1/K2) / (Mp1/Mp2) = (0.75/1.4) = 15/28 ≈0.5357\n\nThus, so the ratio of temps is 15/28, as before.\n\nHence, the answer should be 15/28.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star (semi-major axis) and the star's luminosity. Given that both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances.

First, we use the radial velocity (RV) method to find the ratio of the orbital distances. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is related to the planet's mass and orbital distance. The Doppler shift formula gives the velocity \( v \) for each planet:

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v}{c}
\]

For Planet1 (\( \Delta \lambda = 0.03 \) Å):
\[
v_1 = c \times \frac{0.03}{6300}
\]

For Planet2 (\( \Delta \lambda = 0.04 \) Å):
\[
v_2 = c \times \frac{0.04}{6300}
\]

The ratio of the velocities (RV semi-amplitudes) is:
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Using the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude, planet mass, and orbital distance:
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \left( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \right)^{1/2}
\]

Given \( \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4 \):
\[
0.75 = 1.4 \times \left( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \right)^{1/2}
\]

Solving for the ratio \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \):
\[
\left( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \right)^{1/2} = \frac{0.75}{1.4} \approx 0.5357 \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is given by:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.5357
\]

Expressing this as a fraction:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{15^2}{28^2}} = \frac{15}{28}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 {eq}^4 = \frac{4 \pi R_*^2 \sigma T_{eff}^4 (1 - A)}{16 \pi \sigma a^2 }
\]

Simplifying:

\[
T_{eq}^4 = \frac{ R_*^2 T_{eff}^4 (1 - A) }{4 a^2 }
\]

Taking the fourth root:

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \left( \frac{ R_*^2 (1 - A) }{4 a^2 } \right)^{1/4} } = T_{eff} \left( \frac{ R_* }{ 2 a } \right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, A is the same, so when taking the ratio, the (1 - A)^{1/4} terms cancel out. So,

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{ T_{eff} \sqrt{ R_* / (2 a_1) } }{ T_{eff} \sqrt{ R_* / (2 a_2) } } = \sqrt{ \frac{a_2}{a_1} }
\]

Yes! So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is the square root of the ratio of their orbital distances (a2/a1). Wait, but more precisely, it's the inverse square root: a_2 over a_1 inside the square root. So if a_2 is larger, then the temperature ratio is sqrt(a_2/a_1), which would make T1/T2 larger if a_2 > a_1.

But to get a_1 and a_2, we need to relate the radial velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital distance.

Wait, radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

For a planet orbiting a star, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

\[
K = \left( \frac{2 \pi G}{P} \right)^{1/3} \frac{ M_p \sin i }{ (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} } \frac{1}{c}
\]

Wait, but that's perhaps complicating. Alternatively, we have another version of the formula. The relation between the semi-major axis, a, orbital period P, and the stellar mass.

From Kepler's third law:

\[
P^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 a^3}{G (M_* + M_p)}
\]

But if the planet's mass is much less than the star's mass (which is usually the case, and even 7 Earth masses is much less than 1.5 solar masses), so M_* >> M_p, so we can approximate it as:

\[
P^2 \approx \frac{4 \pi^2 a^3}{G M_*}
\]

Therefore,

\[
a^3 = \frac{ G M_* P^2 }{4 \pi^2 }
\]

So a is related to P and M_*. But we don't know P for either planet.

Alternatively, from the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

\[
K = \frac{ (2 \pi G)^{1/3} }{ (1 + M_p/M_*)^{1/3} } \frac{ M_p \sin i }{ M_*^{2/3} } \frac{1}{c} \frac{1}{P^{1/3} }
\]

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

\[
K \approx \frac{ (2 \pi G)^{1/3} }{ } \frac{ M_p \sin i }{ M_*^{2/3} } \frac{1}{c} \frac{1}{P^{1/3} }
\]

But this seems complex to use without knowing the orbital period P.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that the measured Doppler shift gives us K, which is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. Then the mass of the planet is related to K, P, and the stellar mass.

But perhaps if we can express a in terms of K and the mass and then proceed. This might get tangled. Let's try.

From the radial velocity equation, considering M_p << M_*, and assuming sin i = 1 (since they detected both planets, likely edge-on orbits, which is required for transit method. Since both transits and RV are used, inclination is edge-on, so sin i = 1.

So, K is:

\[
K = \frac{212.9 \times (M_p / M_J) }{ (M_* / M_\odot)^{1/2} } \times \frac{1}{ (a / \text{1 AU})^{1/2} } } \, \text{m/s}
\]

Wait, maybe. Another version of the formula. Hmm.

Alternatively, in natural units, the formula is sometimes expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{ (M_p \sin i) }{ (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} } \times \frac{ 2 \pi G }{ (P c) }^{1/3}
\]

But again, P is needed. Hmm.

Alternatively, since the Doppler shift gives us K, which is related to the planet's mass and orbital parameters.

Wait, I think the missing piece here is that if you have two planets detected by radial velocity, the ratio of their velocities (K1 and K2) can be related to the ratio of their masses and orbital distances.

But in our case, the problem gives the Doppler shift as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. So we can compute the ratio of K1 and K2 (which is v1 and v2 in terms of velocity). So:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{0.03}{6300} \times \frac{6300}{0.04} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

So K1 = 0.75 K2.

But K is the semi-amplitude which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital parameters.

Using the radial velocity formula, for each planet:

\[
K = \frac{ (2 \pi G)^{1/3} }{ (M_*)^{2/3} } \frac{ M_p \sin i }{ } \frac{1}{(1 + M_p/M_*)^{1/3}} \frac{1}{P^{1/3} c}
\]

Assuming M_p << M_*, and sin i = 1, then:

\[
K \approx \frac{ (2 \pi G)^{1/3} }{ (M_*)^{2/3} } \frac{ M_p }{ } \frac{1}{P^{1/3} c}
\]

But if we take the ratio K1/K2:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left( \frac{ M_{p1} }{ M_{p2} } \right) \left( \frac{ P_2 }{ P_1 } \right)^{1/3}
\]

But since P is related to a via Kepler's law:

\[
P^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 a^3}{G M_* }
\]

Thus,

\[
P_1^2 \propto a_1^3 \quad \text{and} \quad P_2^2 \propto a_2^3
\]

Hence,

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting into the K ratio,

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \left( \frac{ (a_2 / a_1)^{3/2} }{ 1 } \right)^{1/3} } = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \left( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \right)^{1/2}
\]

Given that we have:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = 0.75, \quad \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

Therefore,

\[
0.75 = 1.4 \times \left( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \right)^{1/2}
\]

Solving for \(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\):

\[
\left( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \right)^{1/2} = \frac{0.75}{1.4} \approx 0.5357

\Rightarrow \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287

\]

Wait, so a2 = 0.287 a1? That seems Planet2 is closer in than Planet1. But if the equilibrium temperature ratio is \(\sqrt{a_2/a1}\), which would be sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.5357. So T1/T2 ≈ 0.5357. Thus, Planet1 is colder than Planet2. But wait, this seems conflicting with the individual characteristics. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up:

If \(\frac{a_2}{a_1} ≈ 0.287\), that means a2 is smaller than a1, right? Since a2/a1 is 0.287, so a1 is larger. So Planet2 is closer to the star, thus should have a higher equilibrium temperature. Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536. So Planet1's temperature is 0.536 times Planet2's temperature.

But let's verify the calculations again step by step.

Given:

- K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75

- Mass ratio Mp1/Mp2 =7/5=1.4

From the radial velocity formula ratio:

K1/K2 = (Mp1/Mp2) * (P2/P1)^{1/3} 

But P2/P1 = (a2/a1)^{3/2}

Thus,

K1/K2 = (Mp1/Mp2) * (a2/a1)^{1/2}

Substitute 0.75 = 1.4 * (a2/a1)^{0.5}

Therefore,

(a2/a1)^{0.5} = 0.75 /1.4 ≈ 0.5357

Squaring both sides,

a2/a1 ≈ 0.287

Therefore, a2 ≈ 0.287 a1. Hence, Planet2 is closer to the star (smaller a2 than a1), a2 < a1.

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:

Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287)=≈ 0.536

So, Planet1 is about 0.536 times the temperature of Planet2.

But wait, let's check the formula again. The equilibrium temperature:

T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(a)

Since the formula is T = T_eff * sqrt( R*/(2a) )

Hence, T1 / T2 = sqrt( R*/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R*/(2a2) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Therefore, the ratio is sqrt(a2 / a1) ≈ 0.536

Hence, the ratio T1/T2 ≈ 0.536. So, to give the ratio, it's approximately 0.536, so but we need to present it as a fraction.

Wait, perhaps I made an arithmetic error:

Given:

(a2 /a1) = (0.75 /1.4 )^2

Let me compute that again.

0.75 divided by 1.4. 1.4 is 7/5, so 0.75 / (7/5) = 0.75 * 5 /7 = 3/4 *5/7 =15/28 ≈ 0.5357. Then squared is (15/28)^2 = 225 /784 ≈0.287.

So indeed, the ratio a2/a1=225/784.

Therefore, sqrt(a2/a1)=15/28 ≈0.5357

Thus, the ratio of T1/T2 is 15/28, which is 0.5357. So expressed as a fraction, it's 15/28.

But 15 and 28 have a common divisor of 1, so 15/28 cannot be simplified. So the answer is 15/28. Is that the simplest form?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects more precise steps. Let me think again if I missed anything.

Wait, let's check. Another approach to get a.

Alternatively, from Radial velocity semi-amplitude equation:

K = (v) = (2πG / (Pc))^{1/3} * (Mp sin i) / (M_* + Mp)^{2/3}

But given that both planets are detected by transit and RV, the inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i =1. Also, M_* >> Mp, so (M_* + Mp) ≈ M_*. Then:

K ≈ (2πG / (Pc))^{1/3} * (Mp) / M_*^{2/3}

But P is from Kepler's law: P^2 = (4π²/GM_*) a^3 → P = (4π² a^3 / (GM_*))^{1/2}

Substitute P into K:

K ≈ (2πG / ( (4π² a^3 / (GM_*))^{1/2} *c ))^{1/3} * (Mp) / M_*^{2/3}

This is getting complex. Let me compute step-wise.

First, express P in terms of a.

P = sqrt(4π² a^3/(GM_*)) = (4π²/(G M_*))^{1/2} a^{3/2}

So, substitute into K:

K = [2πG / ( (4π²/(G M_*))^{1/2} a^{3/2} c ) ]^{1/3} * (Mp) / M_*^{2/3}

Simplify inside the brackets:

2πG / ( (4π²/(G M_*))^{1/2} a^{3/2} c ) = 2πG / ( (4π²)^{1/2} (G M_*)^{-1/2} a^{3/2} c )

= 2πG / (2 π (G M_*)^{-1/2} a^{3/2} c )

Canceling 2π:

= G / ( (G M_*)^{-1/2} a^{3/2} c )

= G * (G M_*)^{1/2} / (a^{3/2} c )

= G^{3/2} M_*^{1/2} / ( a^{3/2} c )

Therefore, K is now:

[ G^{3/2} M_*^{1/2} / ( a^{3/2} c ) ]^{1/3} * ( Mp ) / M_*^{2/3}

Simplify exponent:

G^{(3/2 * 1/3)} = G^{1/2}

Similarly, M_*^{(1/2 * 1/3)} = M_*^{1/6}

Denominator: a^{(3/2 * 1/3)} = a^{1/2}, c^{1/3}

Thus, numerator terms when combining:

G^{1/2} M_*^{1/6} / (a^{1/2} c^{1/3} ) * Mp / M_*^{2/3} )

= G^{1/2} M_*^{1/6 - 2/3} Mp / (a^{1/2} c^{1/3} )

= G^{1/2} M_*^{-1/2} Mp / (a^{1/2} c^{1/3} )

Therefore, K = (G^{1/2} Mp)/( M_*^{1/2} a^{1/2} c^{1/3} )

But this is getting even more complicated. Perhaps we can write K in terms of a.

But given that, for both planets, we can write K1 and K2:

K1 = (G^{1/2} M_p1)/( M_*^{1/2} a1^{1/2} c^{1/3} )

K2 = (G^{1/2} M_p2)/( M_*^{1/2} a2^{1/2} c^{1/3} )

Taking the ratio K1/K2:

= (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * (a2 / a1)^{1/2}

Which gets us back to the same ratio as before. Therefore, the ratio of K's is (Mp1/Mp2) * sqrt(a2/a1)

So going back, that's where we came from.

Hence, confirming the earlier result. So the calculations seem okay.

So, after the algebra, we have:

T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) ≈ 15/28 ≈ 0.5357

So this should be the ratio.

But let me cross-validate with another perspective. If their RV signals are 0.75 times each other, and mass ratio is 1.4. Then the product (Mp1/K1) and (Mp2/K2) relates to the sqrt(a). Wait, perhaps another way.

Wait, rearrange the ratio K1/K2 = (Mp1 / Mp2) * sqrt(a2/a1)

Rewrite:

sqrt(a2/a1) = (K1/K2) / (Mp1/Mp2) = (0.75/1.4) = 15/28 ≈0.5357

Thus, so the ratio of temps is 15/28, as before.

Hence, the answer should be 15/28. But let's check ... Wait, a2/a1= (15/28)^2, then sqrt(a2/a1)=15/28, so T1/T2=15/28. So if Planet1 is further out (a1 larger than a2), then its temperature is lower, so the ratio is 15/28, as found.

But the problem didn't specify which planet is closer. From the Transits and RV methods. Generally, with RV you get the period, but we aren't given periods. But since they used transits, the orbital period might be calculated from the transit durations, but they didn't give that. So perhaps from RV K and the mass, we use the ratio above.

So, after the entire reasoning, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is 15/28.

Expressed as boxed:

\boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}

But is there any chance we made a mistake in the sign or reciprocal? Let me check again.

Because the Temperature ratio is T1 over T2: sqrt(a2/a1). If a2 is less than a1, then a2/a1 is less than 1, hence sqrt(a2/a1) is also less than 1, which makes T1 less than T2, which makes sense since Planet2 is closer to the star (smaller semi-major axis a2), so hotter. Hence, T1 ≈ 15/28 T2. So ratio T1/T2 =15/28 ≈0.5357.

Yes, that seems correct. Thus, the answer is 15/28.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is \boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}.

Wait, but isn\'t Doppler shift giving the star\'s velocity? Wait, no! The Doppler shift corresponds to Stellar velocity. Hold on, The planet\'s gravitational pull causes the star to move.

So, Δλ is 0.03 Angstrom.\n\nThen, the radial velocity is (Δλ / λ0) * c = (0.03 / 6300) * (3e8 m/s) ≈ (1e-4) * (3e8)/200 ≈ 1.42857e3 m/s ~ 1428 m/s.\n\nWait, but stars move in radial velocity at speeds of meters per second, kilometers per second would be VERY high. A planet like Jupiter induces about 13 m/s. These values (1428 m/s for Planet1 and 0.04 gives ~1900 m/s) would be enormous. That seems impossible. That must mean I\'ve made a mistake here.\n\nWait, check calculation. Convert 0.03 Angstrom over 6300 Angstrom. Let\'s see 6300 Angstrom is 630 nm. 0.03 Angstrom is 0.003 nm. So, the relative shift is 0.003 / 6300 = 4.7619e-7. Multiply that by speed of light: 3e5 km/s. So, 3e5 km/s * 4.7619e-7 ≈ 0.1428 km/s ≈ 142.8 m/s. Ah! So my mistake was mixing unit conversion earlier. So 0.03 /6300 = 4.76e-6*. (Wait wait, 0.03/6300 = 0.00000476...). Wait, perhaps let me redo:\n\nΔλ = 0.03 Å; λ₀ = 6300 Å.\n\nΔλ / λ₀ = 0.03 /6300 = 0.0000047619.\n\nSo Δv = c * (Δλ / λ₀) = 3e8 m/s * 0.0000047619 ≈ 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1428.57 m/s ≈ 1.428 km/s for Planet1, and 0.04 /6300 * 3e8 ≈ (similar math) 0.04/0.03 *1.428 km/s ≈ 1.904 km/s for Planet2. But again, these velocities are way too high for star induced by planets. For example, Jupiter gives our Sun about 13 m/s, a super-Jupiter might give hundreds of m/s, but these planets are smaller (7 and 5 Earth masses) – even worse. Earth mass planet would induce like 0.09 m/s. Hence, perhaps the given shifts correspond to different velocities. Perhaps the calculations refer to the planet’s own velocity... Wait, when a planet transits, sometimes only the star’s radial velocity is measured. The planet\'s own velocity would be much higher as it’s moving in its orbit, but unsure— Does the problem say "gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å"? Gravitational influence (RV method) measures star\'s velocity. But the magnitude seems not plausible unless perhaps the numbers are in the wrong units... Wait, question states... shift of "up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å". But for realistic RV signals, such shifts would be e.g. for Earth-like planet around solar-like star K is ~0.09 m/s gives 0.03 Å shift?\n\nWait: Do it properly. Let’s take Planet1: v_star = 0.03 Å * c /6300 Å.\n\nWait but velocity is (shift in wavelength)/(original wavelength) * speed of light. And 1 m/s is 1e3 mm/s, and since 1 Å = 1e-10 m. Let\'s compute.\n\nΔλ = 0.03 Å = 3e-12 m. Original wavelength λ₀=6300 Å=6.3e-7 m.\n\nSo the velocity v = (3e-12 /6.3e-7 )*3e8 = (approx) (3/6.3)*3e(-12+8 +7+8? Wait:\n\nWait, (Δλ/λ₀) = 3e-12 /6.3e-7 = (3/6.3) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.476e-5. Hence velocity is equal to (0.476e-5)*c where c=3e8 m/s. So 0.476e-5 *3e8≈0.476*3e3≈1.428e3 m/s ≈1.428 km/s.\n\nHowever such high velocity (over a kilometer per second) is unphysical for a star. The error here lies either in the problem statement or my understanding. If orbital periods are the same, but that\'s not specified either. Alternatively, perhaps misapplying Doppler shifts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the confusion comes from the RV method - the Doppler shift is of the star\'s spectral lines due to the planet\'s gravitational tug. However, the values given (thousands of m/s) for the Doppler shift would imply a highly massive star or something else. But in our Solar System, the Sun’s velocity due to Jupiter is about 12.7 m/s. A 7 Earth-mass planet would be about 7/318 Earth masses/Jupiter. So K=12.7 * (7/318) / (1.5)^(1/?) Wait, let\'s implement full formula.\n\nAlternative course: Use radial velocity semi-amplitude equation:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{2 \\pi G}{c} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{P^{1/3} (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} } } \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - e^2}} }\n\\]\n\nBut given e=0 (circular orbits), M_p << M_*, sin i =1 (assuming edge-on orbit), and\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nK \\approx \\frac{2 \\pi G}{c} \\frac{M_p}{(M_*)^{2/3}} P^{-1/3} }\n\\]\n\nHmm. We can solve for P from Kepler\'s third law:\n\n\\[\nP^2 = \\frac{(4 \\pi^2) a^3 }{G M_*}\n\\]\n\nExpressing P in terms of a.\n\nBut how can we proceed here? Our goal is to find orbital distances, which requires more information. Alternatively, given that we are interested in the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, which depend inversely on the square root of the distance. So T ratio would be (a2 / a1)^(-1/2). If we had ratios of a1 and a2, that would do. But to find distances from radial velocity we need to get either P or some way to relate them.\n\nBut we might need to find P for each planet. Using planetary parameters?\n\nAlternatively, since both planets have been detected by both transit and RV methods, perhaps we can derive the inclination angle, but considering the problem doesn\'t mention transit-derived parameters like orbital period or transit duration. Wait, possibly with transits they can get the period, but since not given here, perhaps an oversight.\n\nWait, reviewing the original problem statement: Two planets detected by transit and RV methods. The star\'s parameters: mass=1.5 M_s, radius=1.2 R_s, Teff=6300 K. Planets\' mass and radius given. Both in circular orbits. Planet1 has a [OI] shift of 0.03 Å, Planet2 0.04 Å. Want equilibrium temperature ratio.\n\nGiven both planet\'s Doppler shifts (star\'s speeds), but in reality the Doppler shift (K) is connected to Planetry mass, orbital parameters. The planet\'s mass and orbital distance (and period) must be related.\n\nMoreover, the transit method provides the orbital period, since transits occur at regular intervals. However, period is missing in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe since we are only interested in the ratio, how can we relate it without knowing the absolute distances? Let me think.\n\nThe RV amplitudes (the velocity K) is given by the formula for each planet:\n\nK = (2 π G / c) * (M_p / (M_*)^(2/3)) / (P^(1/3) ), assuming angles and sin i =1).\n\nSimilarly, via Kepler\'s 3rd law, the semi-major axis a is related to period P:\n\na^3 = (G M_* P^2) / (4 π^2 ).\n\nTherefore, a = ( G M_* )^(1/3) ( P / (2 π) )^(2/3).\n\nBut equilibrium temperature is proportional to a^-1/2. If we can find a relation between a and K for each planet, then perhaps relate the K and M_p to a via these equations.\n\nLet me for each planet relate a and K. Given K is the RV semi-amplitude for each planet.\n\nStarting with RV formula for each planet:\n\nK ≈ (2 π G / (c)) * ( M_p / (M_*)^2/3 ) * (P)^(-1/3)\n\nBut at the same time, RvT:\n\na³ = G M_* P²/(4 π² )\n\nTherefore, P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M_* )\n\nP = ( (4 π² a³)/(G M_* ) )^{1/2}\n\nHence, P^(-1/3) = (G M_* )^{1/6} / ( (4 π²)^(1/2) * a^(1/2) ) )\n\nPlugging back in the expression for K:\n\nK ≈ (2 π G /c ) * ( M_p / M*^(2/3) ) * ( G M_* )^{1/6} / (2 π )^(1) * a^(-1/2) )\n\nWait, maybe just taking symbols:\n\nExpress K in terms of a:\n\nStart: K = (2 π G /c ) * M_p / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )\n\nBut P = ( (4 π² a³)/(G M_* ) )^{1/2 )\n\nThus, P^(1/3) = ( (4 π² a³)/(G M_* ) )^{1/6} )\n\nSo substituting:\n\nK = (2 π G / c ) * M_p / [ M_*^(2/3) * (4 π² a³/(G M_* ))^{1/6} ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, let\'s compute M_*^(-2/3) * (G M_* )^{-1/6} = M_*^(-2/3 -1/6) = M_*^(-5/6). Similarly, (4 π²)^{-1/6} = 4^{-1/6} π^{-1/3}. Then (2 π G / c) * (4^{-1/6} π^{-1/3}) ) * (a³)^{ -1/6 * 1 } = (2 π G)/(c 4^{1/6} π^{1/3} ) * a^{-1/2} * M_p / M_*^{5/6}.\n\nHmmm, this seems complicated, maybe shift the equation.\n\nAlternatively, combining the equation:\n\nK = (2 π G ) / c * M_p / [ (M_* )^{2/3} ] * [ (4 π² a³ )/(G M_* ) ]^{-1/6 * 1/} ]\n\nWait this is getting too convoluted. Probably a better approach would be dimensional analysis or comparing variables.\n\nAlternatively, define K in terms of a. Combine equations.\n\nHm, perhaps trying to relate K and a?\n\nOther way; expressing a in terms of K:\n\nFrom RV equation: K ∝ M_p / P^{1/3}. From Kepler3: P^2 ∝ a^3/M_*, then P ∝ sqrt(a^3/M_*).\n\nThen replace into K: K ∝ M_p / ( (a^(3/2)/sqrt(M_*) )^{1/3} }) ∝ M_p / ( a^{1/2} / M_*^(1/6) ) ) ∝ M_p * M_*^(1/6) / a^(1/2)\n\nHence:\n\nK proportional to M_p * M_*^{1/6} / a^{1/2}\n\nThus, a^{1/2} proportional to M_p * M_*^{1/6} / K\n\nTherefore, semi-major axis a proportional to ( M_p^2 * M_*^(1/3) ) / K^2\n\nTherefore, the ratio a₁/a₂ = [ ( M_p1² * M_*^(1/3) ) / K1² ) ] / [ ( M_p2² * M_*^(1/3) ) / K2² ) ] = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )² ) * (K2/ K1 )² )\n\nThe M_* cancels out because both a are around the same star. Thus,\n\nratio a₁ / a₂ = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )² ) * (K2² / K1² )\n\nThen a₁/a₂ = ( (7/5 )² ) * ( (0.04/0.03 )² )\n\nCompute that:\n\n(49/25 ) * (16/9 ) ≈ (49 *16)/(25*9) = 784/225 ≈ 3.484...\n\nThus, the semi-major axis of Planet1 is about 3.484 times that of Planet2? Wait, but wait inversely.\n\nWait: If a∞ (M_p² / K² ), then a1/a2 = (M_p1² / K1² ) / (M_p2² / K2² ) ) = (M_p1 / M_p2 )² * (K2 / K1 )².\n\nWhich is as i said – 7/5 squared times (0.04/0.03) squared.\n\nBut 7^2 =49, 5^2=25. 0.04 /0.03 =4/3, so squared is 16/9.\n\nMultiply: 49/25*16/9 = (49*16)/(25*9) = 784/225 ≈ 3.484...\n\nThus, a1 / a2 ≈3.484. Hence, the semi-major axis of Planet1 is much larger than Planet2. But how about equilibrium temperature ratio?\n\nEquilibrium temperature T ∝ (L_* )^{1/4} / √a\n\nBut L_* is same for both planets. Thus,\n\nT1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nTherefore, since a1/a2 ≈3.484,\n\nsqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(1/3.484 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287)≈0.5357.\n\nThus, the ratio T1/T2 ≈0.5357≈53.57%, so approximate 0.536, so ratio Planet1 / Planet2~ 0.54\n\nBut let me check calculation again step by step as this may be incorrect.\n\nFirst, confirmation: From analyzing the RV proportionality.\n\nBut why does a scale as (M_p / K )² * M_*^{...} but assuming same M_*, which is same for both planets, therefore the ratio above leads yes,\n\na1/a2=( (M_p1)/(M_p2 ))^2 * (K2/K1 )^2 ).\n\nSo (7/5)^2*(0.04/0.03)^2.\n\n7/5 is 1.4, squared is √(49/25 )=1.96. 0.04/0.03 is 1.333, squared ≈1.777.\n\nSo 1.96*1.777≈3.484.\n\nTherefore,a1=≈3.484*a2.\n\nThus,\n\nEqTemp T ∝1/sqrt(a)\n\nThus, T1/T2=sqrt(a2/a1 )=sqrt(1/3.484)=1/sqrt(3.484)=≈1/1.866≈0.536.\n\nBut wait,follow the through even, 성 in considerations.\n\nSo if possible, get to the exact equation T1/T2\n\nBut another angle:\n\nSince T_eq is proportional to (L_* / a² )^(1/4 ).\n\nSo T1 / T2 = [ (L_*/a1² ) / (L_*/a2² ) ]^(1/4 )= (a2² / a1² )^(1/4 )= (a2/a1 )^(1/2 ).\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )=sqrt( (M_p2 /M_p1 )² (K1 / K2 )² )= (M_p2 /M_p1 )(K1 / K2 )\n\nBecause?\n\nWait, from a1/a2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 (K2 / K1 )^2 )\n\nSo sqrt(a2/a1 )=sqrt( (M_p2 /M_p1 )^2 (K1 / K2 )^2 )=(M_p2 /M_p1 )(K1/K2 )\n\nSo T1/T2=(M_p2/R)M_p1 )*(K1 /K2 )\n\nGiven that is true from above.\n\nChecking:\n\nGiven [T1/ T2] = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) ) = sqrt( ( M_p2² * K1² ) / ( M_p1² * K2² ) ) = ( M_p2 / M_p1 )*( K1 / K2 )\n\nYes algebra.\n\nCompute:\n\nPlanet 1: M_p1=7 Earth masses, K1=0.03 Å -> calculated velocity as K1=Δλ₁*c/λ₀ ≈ (0.03/6300)*c = as above, percentage etc.\n\nWait, but since K is not given in velocity, the shifts directly of the spectral lines here as 0.03 and 0.04— to get K in units compatible with.\n\nBut K, the RV semi-amplitude, is indeed (Δλ / λ) * c, where Δλ /λ is the Doppler factor.\n\nBut since both shifts are measured for the same spectral line, using the same star and same spectral line, the ratio Δλ1/Δλ2 is equal to K1/K2, since λ₀ is the same.\n\nThus, K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 =0.03/0.04=3/4.\n\nThus, even approximately T1 / T2 = ( M_p2 / M_p1 )*( K1 / K2 ). Here:\n\nM_p2 =5, M_p1=7 => 5/7\n\nK1/K2= 0.03 /0.04=3/4.\n\nThus:\n\nT1 / T2 = (5/7) * (3/4)=15/28≈0.5357.\n\nTherefore same result!\n\nTherefore, ratio approximately 0.54. So the answer is 15⁄28, unsimplified. Or want decimal?\n\nBut written properly, 15/28 simplifies to… approximately \\boxed{0.54}\n\nBut perhaps compute what \\frac{15}{28} is: 28*0.5=14. 15-14=1. So 0.5357 ≈0.536.\n\nBut precise fractional form is better, expressed as 15⁄28. Alternatively, simplifying that.\n\nBut I think the question wants an exact fraction. Let\'s check: because taking K ratios as 0.03 and 0.04, their ratio is 3/4. Thus the ratio T1 / T2= ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * (K1 / K2 ) = (5/7) * (3/4 ) =15/28.\n\nTherefore, yes. So the final ratio is \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{28}}.\n\nI should check this conclusion. Because according to the steps above, the result is 15/28≈0.5357. Alternatively, express the answer as a reduced fraction.\n\nDouble-check derivation steps. If T1 / T2 equals (M_p2 / M_p1 )*(K1 / K2 ), given that a uses:\n\na1/a2 =[(M_p1 / M_p2 )² * (K2 / K1 )² ]\n\nThen, a1 =a2 * (7/5)² * (0.04 /0.03 )².\n\nBut for T1/T2 derived twice: one is via sqrt(a2/a1 ), which leads to sqrt( (5/7)² * (0.03/0.04 )² ), which is sqrt(25/49 *9/16 )=sqrt(225/784)=15/28. Exactly.\n\nYes, so in fact as:\n\nsqrt(a2/a1 ) equals sqrt( (M_p2/M_p1 )² * (K1/K2 )² )= (M_p2/M_p1 )*(K1 / K2 )\n\nResulting in T1/T2=(5/7)(3/4)=15/28.\n\nThus correct. So the answer is 15/28.\n\nHence, the equilibrium temperature ratio is 15/28.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2 is \\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{28}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743816214, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6025, prompt_tokens=835, total_tokens=6860, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we need to consider the star's luminosity and the planets' orbital distances. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the orbital distance. The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two planets is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find the orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the orbital period and the cube root of the star's mass. Since the Doppler shift (\(\Delta \lambda\)) is proportional to the velocity, we use the given shifts to find the ratio of the velocities (and thus the ratio of \(K\) values):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Using the relationship between the orbital distance \(a\) and the RV semi-amplitude \(K\), along with Kepler's third law, we find:

\[
a \propto \frac{M_p^2}{K^2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \right)^2 \left( \frac{K_2}{K_1} \right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values \(M_{p1} = 7 M_\oplus\), \(M_{p2} = 5 M_\oplus\), \(K_1 / K_2 = 3/4\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{7}{5} \right)^2 \left( \frac{4}{3} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{49}{25} \right) \left( \frac{16}{9} \right) = \frac{784}{225} \approx 3.484
\]

The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is then:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.484}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{225}{784}} = \frac{15}{28}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}
\]

Substituting L_* into the equation for planet temperature gives:

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2 a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

But since the albedo A is the same for both planets, it cancels out in the ratio.

So, the ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{R_* / (2 a_1)}{R_* / (2 a_2)}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Alternatively, this simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} } = \left( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \right)^{1/2}
\]

So I need the semi-major axes (a₁ and a₂) to compute the temperature ratio.

Alternatively, the Kepler's Third Law may relate the orbital distance with the star's mass and orbital period. But missing orbital periods complicate things, unless derived from radial velocity data.

The RV method K is related to the planetary mass and orbital distance.

Wait, the Doppler velocity equation connects the planet's orbital velocity, but since the planet and star are orbiting their mutual center of mass, the star's velocity (V*) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_*), and the orbital distance (a) and inclination (i).

However, without knowing the inclination angle (probably assume sin i ≈ 1?), we can still proceed.

Wait the formula I mentioned earlier relates to the RV semi-amplitude. If I can find K for each planet, then with some other parameters I can find a.

Wait let's recollect. The RV formula gives the velocity of the star induced by the planet. For each planet, K (radial velocity semi-amplitude of the star) would be given by:

\[
K = \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \frac{M_p \sin i}{P^{1/3} (M_* + M_p)^{2/3}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}}
\]

But since the orbits are circular (e = 0) and M_p << M_*, it simplifies to:

\[
K = \left( \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \right) \frac{M_p \sin i}{P^{1/3} M_*^{2/3}}
\]

But we might need to relate to the period and the orbital distance via Kepler’s third law, which for planets:

\[
a^3 = \frac{G M_* P^2}{4 \pi^2}
\]

So to relate a and P. However, perhaps rather than working through these individual equations, I can find the ratio of a for each planet using the observed K and their masses. Let me consider the proportionality.

Starting from the RV equation. Let’s first calculate RV semi-amplitude K for each planet.

Given:
- Planet1: M_p = 7 Earth masses, K (from shift) has v1 calculated as,

v1 = 3e8 m/s * 0.03 / 6300 ≈ (3e8 * 0.03)/(6.3e3) ≈ (9e6)/(6.3e3) ≈ 1.428e3 m/s ≈ 1.428 km/s. Wait, but isn't Doppler shift giving the star's velocity? Wait, no! The Doppler shift corresponds to Stellar velocity. Hold on, The planet's gravitational pull causes the star to move. In reality, this K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, of order meters per second. However, 0.03 Angstrom in 6300 Angstrom line seems like a large shift. Wait, perhaps miscalculating the velocity.

Wait, [O I] line at 6300 Angstrom. Calculated in this system, the shift is 0.03 Angstrom. So, Δλ is 0.03 Angstrom.

Then, the radial velocity is (Δλ / λ0) * c = (0.03 / 6300) * (3e8 m/s) ≈ (1e-4) * (3e8)/200 ≈ 1.42857e3 m/s ~ 1428 m/s.

Wait, but stars move in radial velocity at speeds of meters per second, kilometers per second would be VERY high. A planet like Jupiter induces about 13 m/s. These values (1428 m/s for Planet1 and 0.04 gives ~1900 m/s) would be enormous. That seems impossible. That must mean I've made a mistake here.

Wait, check calculation. Convert 0.03 Angstrom over 6300 Angstrom. Let's see 6300 Angstrom is 630 nm. 0.03 Angstrom is 0.003 nm. So, the relative shift is 0.003 / 6300 = 4.7619e-7. Multiply that by speed of light: 3e5 km/s. So, 3e5 km/s * 4.7619e-7 ≈ 0.1428 km/s ≈ 142.8 m/s. Ah! So my mistake was mixing unit conversion earlier. So 0.03 /6300 = 4.76e-6*. (Wait wait, 0.03/6300 = 0.00000476...). Wait, perhaps let me redo:

Δλ = 0.03 Å; λ₀ = 6300 Å.

Δλ / λ₀ = 0.03 /6300 = 0.0000047619.

So Δv = c * (Δλ / λ₀) = 3e8 m/s * 0.0000047619 ≈ 3e8 * 4.7619e-6 ≈ 1428.57 m/s ≈ 1.428 km/s for Planet1, and 0.04 /6300 * 3e8 ≈ (similar math) 0.04/0.03 *1.428 km/s ≈ 1.904 km/s for Planet2. But again, these velocities are way too high for star induced by planets. For example, Jupiter gives our Sun about 13 m/s, a super-Jupiter might give hundreds of m/s, but these planets are smaller (7 and 5 Earth masses) – even worse. Earth mass planet would induce like 0.09 m/s. Hence, perhaps the given shifts correspond to different velocities. Perhaps the calculations refer to the planet’s own velocity... Wait, when a planet transits, sometimes only the star’s radial velocity is measured. The planet's own velocity would be much higher as it’s moving in its orbit, but unsure— Does the problem say "gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å"? Gravitational influence (RV method) measures star's velocity. But the magnitude seems not plausible unless perhaps the numbers are in the wrong units... Wait, question states... shift of "up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å". But for realistic RV signals, such shifts would be e.g. for Earth-like planet around solar-like star K is ~0.09 m/s gives 0.03 Å shift?

Wait: Do it properly. Let’s take Planet1: v_star = 0.03 Å * c /6300 Å.

Wait but velocity is (shift in wavelength)/(original wavelength) * speed of light. And 1 m/s is 1e3 mm/s, and since 1 Å = 1e-10 m. Let's compute.

Δλ = 0.03 Å = 3e-12 m. Original wavelength λ₀=6300 Å=6.3e-7 m.

So the velocity v = (3e-12 /6.3e-7 )*3e8 = (approx) (3/6.3)*3e(-12+8 +7+8? Wait:

Wait, (Δλ/λ₀) = 3e-12 /6.3e-7 = (3/6.3) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.476e-5. Hence velocity is equal to (0.476e-5)*c where c=3e8 m/s. So 0.476e-5 *3e8≈0.476*3e3≈1.428e3 m/s ≈1.428 km/s.

However such high velocity (over a kilometer per second) is unphysical for a star. The error here lies either in the problem statement or my understanding. If orbital periods are the same, but that's not specified either. Alternatively, perhaps misapplying Doppler shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion comes from the RV method - the Doppler shift is of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational tug. However, the values given (thousands of m/s) for the Doppler shift would imply a highly massive star or something else. But in our Solar System, the Sun’s velocity due to Jupiter is about 12.7 m/s. A 7 Earth-mass planet would be about 7/318 Earth masses/Jupiter. So K=12.7 * (7/318) / (1.5)^(1/?) Wait, let's implement full formula.

Alternative course: Use radial velocity semi-amplitude equation:

\[
K = \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \frac{M_p \sin i}{P^{1/3} (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} } } \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - e^2}} }
\]

But given e=0 (circular orbits), M_p << M_*, sin i =1 (assuming edge-on orbit), and

Thus,

\[
K \approx \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \frac{M_p}{(M_*)^{2/3}} P^{-1/3} }
\]

Hmm. We can solve for P from Kepler's third law:

\[
P^2 = \frac{(4 \pi^2) a^3 }{G M_*}
\]

Expressing P in terms of a.

But how can we proceed here? Our goal is to find orbital distances, which requires more information. Alternatively, given that we are interested in the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, which depend inversely on the square root of the distance. So T ratio would be (a2 / a1)^(-1/2). If we had ratios of a1 and a2, that would do. But to find distances from radial velocity we need to get either P or some way to relate them.

But we might need to find P for each planet. Using planetary parameters?

Alternatively, since both planets have been detected by both transit and RV methods, perhaps we can derive the inclination angle, but considering the problem doesn't mention transit-derived parameters like orbital period or transit duration. Wait, possibly with transits they can get the period, but since not given here, perhaps an oversight.

Wait, reviewing the original problem statement: Two planets detected by transit and RV methods. The star's parameters: mass=1.5 M_s, radius=1.2 R_s, Teff=6300 K. Planets' mass and radius given. Both in circular orbits. Planet1 has a [OI] shift of 0.03 Å, Planet2 0.04 Å. Want equilibrium temperature ratio.

Given both planet's Doppler shifts (star's speeds), but in reality the Doppler shift (K) is connected to Planetry mass, orbital parameters. The planet's mass and orbital distance (and period) must be related.

Moreover, the transit method provides the orbital period, since transits occur at regular intervals. However, period is missing in the problem.

Alternatively, maybe since we are only interested in the ratio, how can we relate it without knowing the absolute distances? Let me think.

The RV amplitudes (the velocity K) is given by the formula for each planet:

K = (2 π G / c) * (M_p / (M_*)^(2/3)) / (P^(1/3) ), assuming angles and sin i =1).

Similarly, via Kepler's 3rd law, the semi-major axis a is related to period P:

a^3 = (G M_* P^2) / (4 π^2 ).

Therefore, a = ( G M_* )^(1/3) ( P / (2 π) )^(2/3).

But equilibrium temperature is proportional to a^-1/2. If we can find a relation between a and K for each planet, then perhaps relate the K and M_p to a via these equations.

Let me for each planet relate a and K. Given K is the RV semi-amplitude for each planet.

Starting with RV formula for each planet:

K ≈ (2 π G / (c)) * ( M_p / (M_*)^2/3 ) * (P)^(-1/3)

But at the same time, RvT:

a³ = G M_* P²/(4 π² )

Therefore, P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M_* )

P = ( (4 π² a³)/(G M_* ) )^{1/2}

Hence, P^(-1/3) = (G M_* )^{1/6} / ( (4 π²)^(1/2) * a^(1/2) ) )

Plugging back in the expression for K:

K ≈ (2 π G /c ) * ( M_p / M*^(2/3) ) * ( G M_* )^{1/6} / (2 π )^(1) * a^(-1/2) )

Wait, maybe just taking symbols:

Express K in terms of a:

Start: K = (2 π G /c ) * M_p / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But P = ( (4 π² a³)/(G M_* ) )^{1/2 )

Thus, P^(1/3) = ( (4 π² a³)/(G M_* ) )^{1/6} )

So substituting:

K = (2 π G / c ) * M_p / [ M_*^(2/3) * (4 π² a³/(G M_* ))^{1/6} ) ]

Simplify:

First, let's compute M_*^(-2/3) * (G M_* )^{-1/6} = M_*^(-2/3 -1/6) = M_*^(-5/6). Similarly, (4 π²)^{-1/6} = 4^{-1/6} π^{-1/3}. Then (2 π G / c) * (4^{-1/6} π^{-1/3}) ) * (a³)^{ -1/6 * 1 } = (2 π G)/(c 4^{1/6} π^{1/3} ) * a^{-1/2} * M_p / M_*^{5/6}.

Hmmm, this seems complicated, maybe shift the equation.

Alternatively, combining the equation:

K = (2 π G ) / c * M_p / [ (M_* )^{2/3} ] * [ (4 π² a³ )/(G M_* ) ]^{-1/6 * 1/} ]

Wait this is getting too convoluted. Probably a better approach would be dimensional analysis or comparing variables.

Alternatively, define K in terms of a. Combine equations.

Hm, perhaps trying to relate K and a?

Other way; expressing a in terms of K:

From RV equation: K ∝ M_p / P^{1/3}. From Kepler3: P^2 ∝ a^3/M_*, then P ∝ sqrt(a^3/M_*).

Then replace into K: K ∝ M_p / ( (a^(3/2)/sqrt(M_*) )^{1/3} }) ∝ M_p / ( a^{1/2} / M_*^(1/6) ) ) ∝ M_p * M_*^(1/6) / a^(1/2)

Hence:

K proportional to M_p * M_*^{1/6} / a^{1/2}

Thus, a^{1/2} proportional to M_p * M_*^{1/6} / K

Therefore, semi-major axis a proportional to ( M_p^2 * M_*^(1/3) ) / K^2

Therefore, the ratio a₁/a₂ = [ ( M_p1² * M_*^(1/3) ) / K1² ) ] / [ ( M_p2² * M_*^(1/3) ) / K2² ) ] = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )² ) * (K2/ K1 )² )

The M_* cancels out because both a are around the same star. Thus,

ratio a₁ / a₂ = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )² ) * (K2² / K1² )

Then a₁/a₂ = ( (7/5 )² ) * ( (0.04/0.03 )² )

Compute that:

(49/25 ) * (16/9 ) ≈ (49 *16)/(25*9) = 784/225 ≈ 3.484...

Thus, the semi-major axis of Planet1 is about 3.484 times that of Planet2? Wait, but wait inversely.

Wait: If a∞ (M_p² / K² ), then a1/a2 = (M_p1² / K1² ) / (M_p2² / K2² ) ) = (M_p1 / M_p2 )² * (K2 / K1 )².

Which is as i said – 7/5 squared times (0.04/0.03) squared.

But 7^2 =49, 5^2=25. 0.04 /0.03 =4/3, so squared is 16/9.

Multiply: 49/25*16/9 = (49*16)/(25*9) = 784/225 ≈ 3.484...

Thus, a1 / a2 ≈3.484. Hence, the semi-major axis of Planet1 is much larger than Planet2. But how about equilibrium temperature ratio?

Equilibrium temperature T ∝ (L_* )^{1/4} / √a

But L_* is same for both planets. Thus,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Therefore, since a1/a2 ≈3.484,

sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(1/3.484 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287)≈0.5357.

Thus, the ratio T1/T2 ≈0.5357≈53.57%, so approximate 0.536, so ratio Planet1 / Planet2~ 0.54

But let me check calculation again step by step as this may be incorrect.

First, confirmation: From analyzing the RV proportionality.

But why does a scale as (M_p / K )² * M_*^{...} but assuming same M_*, which is same for both planets, therefore the ratio above leads yes,

a1/a2=( (M_p1)/(M_p2 ))^2 * (K2/K1 )^2 ).

So (7/5)^2*(0.04/0.03)^2.

7/5 is 1.4, squared is √(49/25 )=1.96. 0.04/0.03 is 1.333, squared ≈1.777.

So 1.96*1.777≈3.484.

Therefore,a1=≈3.484*a2.

Thus,

EqTemp T ∝1/sqrt(a)

Thus, T1/T2=sqrt(a2/a1 )=sqrt(1/3.484)=1/sqrt(3.484)=≈1/1.866≈0.536.

But wait,follow the through even, 성 in considerations.

So if possible, get to the exact equation T1/T2

But another angle:

Since T_eq is proportional to (L_* / a² )^(1/4 ).

So T1 / T2 = [ (L_*/a1² ) / (L_*/a2² ) ]^(1/4 )= (a2² / a1² )^(1/4 )= (a2/a1 )^(1/2 ).

Which is the same as before.

Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1 )=sqrt( (M_p2 /M_p1 )² (K1 / K2 )² )= (M_p2 /M_p1 )(K1 / K2 )

Because?

Wait, from a1/a2 = ( (M_p1 / M_p2 )^2 (K2 / K1 )^2 )

So sqrt(a2/a1 )=sqrt( (M_p2 /M_p1 )^2 (K1 / K2 )^2 )=(M_p2 /M_p1 )(K1/K2 )

So T1/T2=(M_p2/R)M_p1 )*(K1 /K2 )

Given that is true from above.

Checking:

Given [T1/ T2] = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) ) = sqrt( ( M_p2² * K1² ) / ( M_p1² * K2² ) ) = ( M_p2 / M_p1 )*( K1 / K2 )

Yes algebra.

Compute:

Planet 1: M_p1=7 Earth masses, K1=0.03 Å -> calculated velocity as K1=Δλ₁*c/λ₀ ≈ (0.03/6300)*c = as above, percentage etc.

Wait, but since K is not given in velocity, the shifts directly of the spectral lines here as 0.03 and 0.04— to get K in units compatible with.

But K, the RV semi-amplitude, is indeed (Δλ / λ) * c, where Δλ /λ is the Doppler factor.

But since both shifts are measured for the same spectral line, using the same star and same spectral line, the ratio Δλ1/Δλ2 is equal to K1/K2, since λ₀ is the same.

Thus, K1/K2 = Δλ1 / Δλ2 =0.03/0.04=3/4.

Thus, even approximately T1 / T2 = ( M_p2 / M_p1 )*( K1 / K2 ). Here:

M_p2 =5, M_p1=7 => 5/7

K1/K2= 0.03 /0.04=3/4.

Thus:

T1 / T2 = (5/7) * (3/4)=15/28≈0.5357.

Therefore same result!

Therefore, ratio approximately 0.54. So the answer is 15⁄28, unsimplified. Or want decimal?

But written properly, 15/28 simplifies to… approximately \boxed{0.54}

But perhaps compute what \frac{15}{28} is: 28*0.5=14. 15-14=1. So 0.5357 ≈0.536.

But precise fractional form is better, expressed as 15⁄28. Alternatively, simplifying that.

But I think the question wants an exact fraction. Let's check: because taking K ratios as 0.03 and 0.04, their ratio is 3/4. Thus the ratio T1 / T2= ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * (K1 / K2 ) = (5/7) * (3/4 ) =15/28.

Therefore, yes. So the final ratio is \boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}.

I should check this conclusion. Because according to the steps above, the result is 15/28≈0.5357. Alternatively, express the answer as a reduced fraction.

Double-check derivation steps. If T1 / T2 equals (M_p2 / M_p1 )*(K1 / K2 ), given that a uses:

a1/a2 =[(M_p1 / M_p2 )² * (K2 / K1 )² ]

Then, a1 =a2 * (7/5)² * (0.04 /0.03 )².

But for T1/T2 derived twice: one is via sqrt(a2/a1 ), which leads to sqrt( (5/7)² * (0.03/0.04 )² ), which is sqrt(25/49 *9/16 )=sqrt(225/784)=15/28. Exactly.

Yes, so in fact as:

sqrt(a2/a1 ) equals sqrt( (M_p2/M_p1 )² * (K1/K2 )² )= (M_p2/M_p1 )*(K1 / K2 )

Resulting in T1/T2=(5/7)(3/4)=15/28.

Thus correct. So the answer is 15/28.

Hence, the equilibrium temperature ratio is 15/28.


**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 to Planet2 is \boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}.

The next step: determine each planet\'s semi-major axis.\n\nTo determine the semi-major axis, we can use information from the radial velocity method. The radial velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) relates to the planet\'s mass \\( M_p \\), the star\'s mass \\( M_* \\), orbital period \\( P \\), and inclination \\( i \\). However, unless we determine the inclination, we can’t obtain true mass. But here, since the problem states that both methods—transit and radial velocity—were used, transits require the orbital plane to be edge-on, meaning \\( i \\approx 90^\\circ \\), so \\( \\sin i = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, given that these RV measurements yield the true masses because the inclination is determined by transit (if transiting, then \\( i \\approx 90^{\\circ} \\)), allowing the use of the mass function. However, perhaps instead of mass, we can harness Kepler\'s third law since the period and semi-major axis are connected.\n\nNevertheless, our first task is to find the relationship between the semi-major axes of the planets based on the available data.\n\nBut wait, we have velocities (as Doppler shifts) and masses of the planets. Let\'s check the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. The formula is:\n\n\\[\nK = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi G}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_* + M_p)^{2/3}} \\frac{1}{c}\n\\]\n\nWait, I might need to recollect the precise formula. Alternatively, alternative forms might exist. Let\'s recall that, in the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude \\( K \\) (in m/s) is given by:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{2 \\pi G}{c} \\cdot \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_* + M_p)^{2/3}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1 - e^2)^{1/2} P^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nHere, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, and e is eccentricity (which is zero for circular orbits). Since both orbits are circular, \\( e = 0 \\), so the denominator term \\( (1 - e^2)^{1/2}}=1 \\). Additionally, for a planet much less massive than the star, \\( M_p << M_* \\), so we might approximate \\( M_* + M_p \\approx M_* \\).\n\nHence, simplify:\n\n\\[\nK \\approx \\frac{2 \\pi G}{c} \\cdot \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{M_*^{2/3}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{P^{1/3}}\n\\]\n\nBut how does this relate to the semi-major axis \\( a \\)?

Maybe another path is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since both planets orbit the same star, we can take the ratio of their semi-major axes by considering the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes \\( K \\), their masses, since the other factors (stellar mass, gravitational constant, etc.) would cancel out in the ratio.\n\nLet\'s denote all variables associated with Planet1 as \\( K_1 \\), \\( M_{p1} \\), and those with Planet2 as \\( K_2 \\), \\( M_{p2} \\).\n\nStarting from the radial velocity equation:\n\n\\[\nK = \\left( \\frac{G}{c} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{ (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} } \\cdot \\frac{2 \\pi}{P^{1/3} \\sqrt{1 - e^2}}\n\\]\n\nGiven circular orbits (\\( e = 0 \\)) and \\( M_p \\ll M_* \\), the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nK \\approx \\left( \\frac{G}{c} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{ M_*^{2/3} } \\cdot \\frac{2 \\pi}{ P^{1/3} }\n\\]\n\nFrom Kepler\'s third law (\\( P^2 \\propto a^3 / M_* \\)): \\( P^{1/3} \\propto a^{1/2} / M_*^{1/6} \\).\n\nBut rather than substituting, taking the ratio \\( K_1 / K_2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_{p1} \\sin i_1}{M_{p2} \\sin i_2} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nBut transiting planets have \\( i \\approx 90^\\circ \\), hence \\( \\sin i = 1 \\) or close to it. Since both planets are detected by transit, their \\( \\sin i \\approx 1 \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nBut how does the period relate to the system? Alternatively, perhaps use that the Doppler shift velocity (\\( K \\)) is inversely related to the cube root of the period (since \\( K \\propto 1 / P^{1/3} \\)) when mass and other parameters are fixed. But combined with the planet\'s mass.\n\nAlternatively, since we know Doppler shifts (i.e., \\( K \\)) and planet masses, let\'s think about Kepler\'s third law.\n\nBut now another idea. If we can calculate the velocity \\( v \\) via the Doppler shift, set that equal to the RV semi-amplitude \\( K \\), then the formula connecting \\( K \\), \\( M_p \\), \\( M_* \\), \\( a \\).\n\nWait, recalling another formula for RV semi-amplitude:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{v_*}{1} = \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\cdot \\frac{v_p}{1}\n\\]\n\nBut in reality, because of Newtonian mechanics, the star and planet orbit the common center of mass. So velocity of the star \\( v_* \\) relates to velocity of the planet \\( v_p \\) as \\( v_* = (M_p / M_*) v_p \\).\n\nFor a circular orbit, the velocity of the planet is \\( v_p = \\sqrt{G M_* / a} \\). Hence,\n\n\\[\nv_* = M_p / M_* \\cdot \\sqrt{G M_* / a} = \\frac{M_p}{M_*} \\sqrt{G M_* / a}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nK = v_* = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_*}} \\sqrt{G / a}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}\n\\]\n\nBut we can solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, for each planet:\n\n\\[\na_1 = \\frac{G M_{p1}^2}{K_1^2 M_*}\n\\]\n\\[\na_2 = \\frac{G M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2 M_*}\n\\]\n\nTaking the ratio \\( a_2 / a_1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{ \\frac{G M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2 M_*} }{ \\frac{G M_{p1}^2}{K_1^2 M_*} } = \\frac{M_{p2}^2 K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2 K_2^2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nThis might be a useful relationship.\n\nAlternatively, I found perhaps conflicting derivations above because multiple parameters could be related here. Alternatively, let me ensure this formula:\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_* a}} \\sqrt{G}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\nFor Planet1,\n\n\\[\nK_1 = \\frac{M_{p1}}{\\sqrt{M_* a_1}} \\sqrt{G}\n\\]\n\nFor Planet2,\n\n\\[\nK_2 = \\frac{M_{p2}}{\\sqrt{M_* a_2}} \\sqrt{G}\n\\]\n\nTaking the ratio \\( K_1 / K_2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\cdot \\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nGot it. Hence:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a2}{a1} = \\left( \\frac{K1}{K2} \\cdot \\frac{Mp2}{Mp1} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nNow, leave this aside. The critical step is arriving at:\n\nEquilibrium temp ratio = sqrt( a2 / a1 )\n\nFrom previous:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T1}{T2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a2}{a1}} = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{K1}{K2} \\cdot \\frac{Mp2}{Mp1} \\right)^2 } = \\frac{K1}{K2} \\cdot \\frac{Mp2}{Mp1}\n\\]\n\nHence,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T1}{T2} = \\left( \\frac{K1}{K2} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{Mp2}{Mp1} \\right)\n\\]\n\nHmm, let\'s see. Using the formula above.\n\nYes, because if \\( a2 / a1 \\) equals \\( ( ( K1 / K2 ) * ( Mp2 / Mp1 ) ) squared, then sqrt( a2/a1 ) is exactly K1/K2 * Mp2/Mp1.\n\nTherefore, hence, the temperature ratio is (K1 / K2 ) * (Mp2 / Mp1 )\n\nOkay, but let\'s verify this logical jump again. Suppose:\n\nWe have a_2 / a_1 = ( (K1 * Mp2)/(K2 * Mp1) )^2\n\nThen, sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = (K1 * Mp2)/(K2 * Mp1)\n\nTherefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = (K1 / K2) * (Mp2 / Mp1)\n\nExactly. So this is a direct relation.\n\nThus, if I can compute ( (K1 / K2 ) * (Mp2/Mp1) ), that will answer the temperature ratio.\n\nNow, we need to calculate K1 and K2 from the Doppler shifts provided.\n\nGiven that for each planet, the maximum Doppler shift is given as a shift in the [OI] line at 6300 Å.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Doppler shift formula is:\n\nΔλ / λ0 = v / c ⇒ v = c * Δλ / λ0\n\nHence for Planet1, Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, λ0 = 6300 Å:\n\nv1 (K1) = c * 0.03 / 6300\n\nSimilarly, Planet2, Δλ2 = 0.04 Å:\n\nv2 (K2) = c * 0.04 / 6300\n\nTherefore,\n\nK1 = (3e8 m/s) * 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 0.03/6300 is of order ~5e-6, so 3e8 * 5e-6 ≈ 1.5e3 m/s\n\nWait, but have to compute precisely.\n\nActually, for Planet1:\n\nv1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c\n\nc ≈ 3e8 m/s.\n\nSo,\n\n(0.03 / 6300) * 3e8 = 0.03 * 3e8 / 6300\n\n= (0.03 * 3e8) / 6300 = (9e6) / 6300 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.\n\nBut 9e6 divided by 6300:\n\n6300 × 1428 ≈ 9,000,000 (since 1428.57 × 6.3 = 9000, which is 6.3 thousand, hence 6.3 × 1428.57 ≈ 9000)\n\nYes:\n\nCompute 9e6 ÷ 6300:\n\n9e6 / 6.3e3 = 9 / 6.3 * 1e3 ≈ 1.42857 * 1e3 ≈ 1428.57 m/s. So K1≈ 1428.57 m/s.\n\nSimilarly for Planet2:\n\nv2 = (0.04 / 6300) * 3e8 = (0.04 * 3e8) /6300 = 1.2e7 / 6300 ≈ 1904.76 m/s.\n\nBut wait, is it realistic that the RV semi-amplitude is over 1 km/s? That\'s for a planet. For example, Jupiter induces a RV of about 13 m/s on the Sun. If these values here are 1428 m/s and 1904 m/s, these are way too high. This must indicate that I have messed up the calculation.\n\nReflecting, [OI] swing of 0.03 Å over 6300 Å. Let me calculate:\n\nΔλ/λ = 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6.\n\nThen velocity v = c * Δλ/λ ≈ 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1428 m/s. That\'s correct, but do Doppler shifts go up to that?\n\nBut such velocities (over 1 km/s) induced by planets seem impossible, as even a Jupiter mass would only cause proximately tens of m/s. Hence, likely an issue here. Therefore, I probably made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, re-examize the problem statement:\n\n" inducing a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å,...the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. "\n\nBut wait, if shifts are induced via gravitational microlensing? Alternative—stellar motion induced by planets.\n\nActually, the Doppler shift measured in the star\'s spectral lines is a result of the star\'s velocity toward/away from us due to the planet\'s gravitational pull. The theoretical maximum velocity semi-amplitude is K.\n\nBut even for a Jupiter-like planet (about 318 Earth masses), K is around 13 m/s for a Sun-like star (September for a 1-year period.\n\nBut according to the calculations above, the Doppler velocities here are nearly 1.4 km/s and 1.9 km/s, which would imply extremely massive planets or very close orbits. This inconsistency suggests that my assumption may be incorrect. Is the Doppler shift given here as 0.03 Angstrom maybe.\n\nWait, solution to take on the problem\'s given values.\n\nEither I trust the problem\'s given values or not. Assuming there\'s not an orders-of-magnitude error, and proceed with computed K values just found.\n\nAlternatively, am I confusing Å with something else? But 0.03 Å(x maybe refers to the full width half maximum movement of spectral line? Or, due to irradiation?\n\nWait, no—the Doppler shift of the star\'s own spectral line is due to its velocity. In this problem, "periodic Doppler shift" implies via the reflex motion due to the planet. Yet, high masses?\n\nAlternatively, but planets are 7 and 5 Earth masses, which are lower than Neptune (about 17 Earth masses). Given that K for Earth around the Sun is 0.09 m/s. But the Star is 1.5 solar mass.\n\nWait, standard RV semi-amplitude formula for planets.\n\nFormally, the formula:\n\nK = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (2 pi c) )^(1/3) / (M_*^(2/3) sqrt(1 - e^2)) ) * ( (2 pi / P ))^(1/3)\n\nBut perhaps re-express, as: K is RV semi-amplitude.\n\nOkay, maybe better to calculate K_1 and K_2 using the Doppler shift. Let\'s recompute numerical values more precisely. While speeds of 10^3 m/s are indeed unreasonable, indicating perhaps an initial error.\n\nAR: Specifying that the shift is in the forbidden line. Forbidden lines are usually in low-density environments, but maybe these are emission lines from the star (unlikely). If the planet\'s gravity influences the star\'s atmosphere to emit at shifted wavelengths. But no, natural the Doppler shift is due to the motion of the star.\n\nGiven that both Doppler shifts reported—0.03 Å and 0.04 Å—using same spectral line at 6300Å—probably means that they correspond to the velocity of the star induced by each planet.\n\nHowever, such large velocities seem implausible for planets with 7 and 5 Earth masses. Probably, the units are mistaken: 0.03 and 0.04 mÅ (milliAngstroms) instead of Å? But the problem explicitly states 0.03 Å. Let\'s assume the question is correct and proceed.\n\nTherefore: K1 =0.03 /6300 * c ，where is that in m/s? 0.03Å /6300Å is 0.03/6300 = 4.7619e-6 → v=4.7619e-6 *c.\n\nBut c≈3e8 m/s → v≈4.7619e-6 *3e8 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.\n\nSimilarly for K2: 0.04 / 6300 *3e8 ≈ 1904.76 m/s.\n\nSo, K1 ≈ 1428.57 m/s, K2 ≈1904.76 m/s.\n\nNow, according to our ratio:\n\nT1/T2 = (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1 )\n\nGiven that Planet1 has mass 7 Earth masses, Planet2 has 5 Earth masses.\n\nHence:\n\nM_p2 =5, M_p1=7.\n\nThus:\n\n(K1/K2)= 1428.57/1904.76≈0.75.\n\nMultiplying by (5/7): 0.75*(5/7)= (3/4)*(5/7)=15/28 ≈0.5357.\n\nTherefore, T1 is about 0.5357 × T2 → T1/T2≈0.5357 → alternatively T1 is cooler than T2.\n\nSince T equilibrium is inversely related to the square root of a, and K and planet mass influence a accordingly. Thus, the conclusion 0.5357 ≈53.6% would be Temp ratio. The ratio T1 / T2 is approximately 15/28 ≅0.5357.\n\nBut in the problem, they are probably looking for the exact value.\n\nThus,\n\nFraction: (0.03/0.04) * (5/7)\n\nAh. Wait:\n\nWait, let\'s Provide that PI K1 and K2 arepossibly directly the shifts. so K we can preserve the ratio.\n\nAs K1 / K2 = (0.03/0.04) = 3/4. Then, SCALED with (M_p2 / M_p1=5/7). Therefore, if temp ratio, which is (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1), that is (3/4)*(5/7)=15/28.\n\nTherefore， this is exact. So, Ratio (T1 / T2)=15/28. Hence, planezbr>\n\nBut this leads us to consider whether any gravitational constant, c factors, G, etcetera are assumed to cancel out. But velocity K is related via K1=Δλ1*c/λ0 and K2=Δλ2*c/λ0. Thus their K1/K2 ratio is Δλ1/Δλ2, and multiply by Mp2/Mp1. Hence,\n\nSince lbefore considering units:\n\nYes. As K\'s are Δλ scales directly:\n\nSince delta(lambda)/lambda=v/c. Therefore, delta(lambda)=v*lambda/c. Thus, given delta(lambda)_1=0.03, delta(lambda)_2=0.04, divide by same lambda=6300, ergo v1/v2=0.03/0.04=3/4. Hence K1/K2=3/4. Which is why T1 /T2= K1/K2 * (Mp2/Mp1) =0.75*(5/7)=15/28≈0.5357.\n\nHence, accept this as the conclusion.\n\nBut converting 15/28. Simplify 15/28 （=15 divided by28）≅0.5357.\n\nTherefore, ratio of equilibrium temperatures—T1 over T2 equals approximately 0.5357. But needs to be rationalized as a fraction.\n\nQuestion says "ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2." So the answer is 15⁄28 or sqrt(15/28) sqrt( another expression )?\n\nWait, back to equilibrium temp formula.\n\nImportant to verify one last time whether Temperature indeed scales as sqrt(a2/a1) which is due to (from initial derivation):\n\nT ~ sqrt( R* / 2a) where isn’t There any dependence on star\'s Teff or luminosity?\n\nWait no, from the formula:\n\nT_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R* / (2a) ) * (1 - A)^{1/4}\n\nSo scaling with T_eff is also there.\n\nBut since both planets orbit the same star, T_eff and R_* are constants. Hence, ratio:\n\nT1/T2= sqrt( (R_*/2a1)/(R_*/2a2) )=sqrt( a2/a1 )\n\nWhich is = sqrt( ( (K1/K2) * (Mp2 / Mp1) )² ) = | (K1/K2) * (Mp2/Mp1) | ⇒)\n\nWhich since K1 and K2 are positive numbers, ratio i>\n\nTherefore:\n\n ratio = (K1/K2) * (Mp2/Mp1)\n\nThus, the ratio is (3/4)*(5/7)=15/28 ≅0.5357。\n\nTherefore, the answer is 15/28. However, this must be simplified, but since 15 and 28 share no common factors, So when question asks for the ratio, is written as 15:28 or 15/28. The problem says "ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2" So is likely to expect fractional number: numerator and denominator.\n\nBut let me check calculation again using sorted steps.\n\nStep 1: Use Doppler shifts to compute velocity ratio:\n\nV1 / V2 = DeltaLambda1 / DeltaLambda2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4\n\nStep 2: Derivative a2/a1 using:\n\nFrom radial velocity/doppler/Mass:k scaling:\n\nGiven heKm拖 - formula govern a through .\n\nAs agreed earlier:\n\nforcing through ratio gives a2/a1 = ( ( (BigKF）*(Mp2 / Mp1) )^2\n\nBut higher arrangement步骤）\n\n结论上ratio of a2/a1 = ( ( K1 / K2 ) * ( Mp2 / Mp1 ))^2 )\n\nThus, ratio T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = ( K1 / K2 ) * ( Mp2 / Mp1 )\n\nAs found.\n\nHence when substituting values.\n\nK1 = .03, K2=0.04, but their ratio 3/4\n\nMp1=7 Earth Mp2=5 Earth, so ratio Mp2/Mp1=5/7.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recognizing that the equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their orbital distances. The key steps are:

1. **Determine the velocity ratio from Doppler shifts**:  
   The Doppler shift formula relates the velocity \( v \) to the wavelength shift \(\Delta \lambda\) as:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v}{c}
   \]
   For Planet1 (\(\Delta \lambda = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\)) and Planet2 (\(\Delta \lambda = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)):
   \[
   \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

2. **Relate orbital distances using the velocity ratio and planet masses**:  
   Using the relationship derived from the radial velocity method and Kepler's third law:
   \[
   \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \right)^2
   \]
   Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{3}{4} \), \( M_{p1} = 7 \, M_\oplus \), and \( M_{p2} = 5 \, M_\oplus \):
   \[
   \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left( \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{7} \right)^2
   \]

3. **Compute the equilibrium temperature ratio**:  
   The equilibrium temperature ratio is the square root of the orbital distance ratio:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{28}
   \]

**Final Answer**:  
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is \boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}.

\[
T_{eq}^4 = \frac{(4 \pi R_*^2 \sigma T_{eff}^4) (1 - A)}{16 \pi \sigma a^2}
\]

Simplify:

\[
T_{eq}^4 = \frac{R_*^2 T_{eff}^4 (1 - A)}{4 a^2}
\]

Taking the fourth root:

\[
T_{eq} = T_{eff} \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2 a}} (1 - A)^{1/4}
\]

Given that the albedo \( A \) is identical for both planets, that factor will cancel when considering the ratio. Hence, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2 a_1}}}{\sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2 a_2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Therefore, the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of their semi-major axes. Thus, we need the ratio \( a_2 / a_1 \).

But where do \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) come from? The next step: determine each planet's semi-major axis.

To determine the semi-major axis, we can use information from the radial velocity method. The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) relates to the planet's mass \( M_p \), the star's mass \( M_* \), orbital period \( P \), and inclination \( i \). However, unless we determine the inclination, we can’t obtain true mass. But here, since the problem states that both methods—transit and radial velocity—were used, transits require the orbital plane to be edge-on, meaning \( i \approx 90^\circ \), so \( \sin i = 1 \).

Therefore, given that these RV measurements yield the true masses because the inclination is determined by transit (if transiting, then \( i \approx 90^{\circ} \)), allowing the use of the mass function. However, perhaps instead of mass, we can harness Kepler's third law since the period and semi-major axis are connected.

Nevertheless, our first task is to find the relationship between the semi-major axes of the planets based on the available data.

But wait, we have velocities (as Doppler shifts) and masses of the planets. Let's check the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. The formula is:

\[
K = \left( \frac{2 \pi G}{P} \right)^{1/3} \frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_* + M_p)^{2/3}} \frac{1}{c}
\]

Wait, I might need to recollect the precise formula. Alternatively, alternative forms might exist. Let's recall that, in the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude \( K \) (in m/s) is given by:

\[
K = \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_* + M_p)^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{1}{(1 - e^2)^{1/2} P^{1/3}}
\]

Here, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, and e is eccentricity (which is zero for circular orbits). Since both orbits are circular, \( e = 0 \), so the denominator term \( (1 - e^2)^{1/2}}=1 \). Additionally, for a planet much less massive than the star, \( M_p << M_* \), so we might approximate \( M_* + M_p \approx M_* \).

Hence, simplify:

\[
K \approx \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_*^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

But how does this relate to the semi-major axis \( a \)? Kepler's third law states:

\[
P^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 a^3}{G M_*}
\]

Hence,

\[
P^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4 \pi^2 a^3}{G M_*} \right)^{1/6} = \left( \frac{4 \pi^2}{G M_*} \right)^{1/6} a^{1/2}
\]

Substituting into the expression for \( K \):

\[
K \approx \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_*^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{1}{\left( \frac{4 \pi^2}{G M_*} \right)^{1/6} a^{1/2}}}
\]

Simplify:

First, let's express \( \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \cdot \frac{1}{\left( \frac{4 \pi^2}{G M_*} \right)^{1/6}} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_*^{2/3}} a^{-1/2} \).

This seems complex. Let's process each component step-by-step.

First, we can express \( \left( \frac{4 \pi^2}{G M_*} \right)^{1/6} = (4 \pi^2)^{1/6} (G M_*)^{-1/6} \).

So, substituting back:

\[
K \approx \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_*^{2/3}} \cdot (4 \pi^2)^{-1/6} (G M_*)^{1/6} a^{-1/2}
\]

Simplify powers:

\( G \) has power \(1 + 1/6 = 7/6 \)

\( M_*^{-2/3 + 1/6} = M_*^{-1/2} \)

Combine terms for constants:

\( 2 \pi \times (4 \pi^2)^{-1/6} \)

Calculating \( (4 \pi^2)^{1/6} = (4)^{1/6} (\pi^2)^{1/6} = 2^{1/3} \pi^{1/3} \)

Then,

\( 2 \pi / (2^{1/3} \pi^{1/3}) = 2^{1 - 1/3} \pi^{1 - 1/3} = 2^{2/3} \pi^{2/3} \)

Therefore, combining all constants:

2^{2/3} π^{2/3} * G^{7/6} / c * ... Perhaps my method here is getting too tangled. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to re-arrange in terms of Kepler's third law to relate \( a \) and \( P \), then use \( K \) expressions to express \( a \) in terms of \( K \) and other variables.

Let me reconsider.

Starting with Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 = G M_* \frac{P^2}{4 \pi^2}
\]

Hence, \( P^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 a^3}{G M_*} \Rightarrow P = \frac{2 \pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{G M_*}} \

Plugging this back into the \( K \) formula (approximate version):

Since:

\[
K = \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_*^{2/3} P^{1/3}}
\]

Note: Here, substituting P from Kepler's law.

But substituting \( P = \frac{2 \pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{G M_*}}} \) into the \( K \) expression:

\[
K = \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_*^{2/3}} \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{G M_*}}{2 \pi a^{3/2}} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Simplify:

First, take the \( P^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2 \pi a^{3/2}}{\sqrt{G M_*}} \right)^{1/3} \), which is \( (2 \pi)^{1/3} a^{1/2} (G M_*)^{-1/6} } \). Therefore,

Expressed:

\[
K = \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_*^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{1/3} a^{1/2} (G M_*)^{-1/6} }
\]

Breaking it down:

\[
K = \frac{2 \pi G}{c} \cdot \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{1/3}} \cdot M_p \sin i \cdot \frac{1}{M_*^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{(G M_*)^{1/6}}{a^{1/2}}
\]

Combine terms:

Constants:

\( \frac{2 \pi}{(2 \pi)^{1/3}} = (2 \pi)^{1 - 1/3} = (2 \pi)^{2/3} \)

G terms: \( G \times (G)^{1/6} = G^{7/6} \)

M_* terms: \( M_*^{-2/3} \times M_*^{1/6} = M_*^{-1/2} \)

Therefore,

\[
K = \frac{(2 \pi)^{2/3} G^{7/6}}{c} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{M_*^{1/2} a^{1/2}}
\]

This equation links \( K \) with \( M_p \), \( M_* \), and \( a \ ). But solving for \( a \) here requires expressing \( a \) in terms of \( K \), \( M_p \), \( M_* \):

Rewrite the equation:

\[
K = \frac{(2 \pi)^{2/3} G^{7/6}}{c} \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_* a)^{1/2}}
\]

Rearranged for \( (M_* a)^{1/2} \):

\[
(M_* a)^{1/2} = \frac{(2 \pi)^{2/3} G^{7/6}}{c K} M_p \sin i
\]

Square both sides:

\[
M_* a = \left( \frac{(2 \pi)^{2/3} G^{7/6}}{c K} M_p \sin i \right)^2
\]

Thus,

\[
a = \frac{(2 \pi)^{4/3} G^{7/3} M_p^2 \sin^2 i}{c^2 K^2 M_*}
\]

But this seems quite complicated and perhaps leads to errors. Maybe another path is more straightforward.

Alternatively, since both planets orbit the same star, we can take the ratio of their semi-major axes by considering the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes \( K \), their masses, since the other factors (stellar mass, gravitational constant, etc.) would cancel out in the ratio.

Let's denote all variables associated with Planet1 as \( K_1 \), \( M_{p1} \), and those with Planet2 as \( K_2 \), \( M_{p2} \).

Starting from the radial velocity equation:

\[
K = \left( \frac{G}{c} \right) \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{ (M_* + M_p)^{2/3} } \cdot \frac{2 \pi}{P^{1/3} \sqrt{1 - e^2}}
\]

Given circular orbits (\( e = 0 \)) and \( M_p \ll M_* \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
K \approx \left( \frac{G}{c} \right) \cdot \frac{M_p \sin i}{ M_*^{2/3} } \cdot \frac{2 \pi}{ P^{1/3} }
\]

From Kepler's third law (\( P^2 \propto a^3 / M_* \)): \( P^{1/3} \propto a^{1/2} / M_*^{1/6} \).

But rather than substituting, taking the ratio \( K_1 / K_2 \):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1} \sin i_1}{M_{p2} \sin i_2} \cdot \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3}
\]

But transiting planets have \( i \approx 90^\circ \), hence \( \sin i = 1 \) or close to it. Since both planets are detected by transit, their \( \sin i \approx 1 \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{1/3}
\]

But how does the period relate to the system? Alternatively, perhaps use that the Doppler shift velocity (\( K \)) is inversely related to the cube root of the period (since \( K \propto 1 / P^{1/3} \)) when mass and other parameters are fixed. But combined with the planet's mass.

Alternatively, since we know Doppler shifts (i.e., \( K \)) and planet masses, let's think about Kepler's third law.

But now another idea. If we can calculate the velocity \( v \) via the Doppler shift, set that equal to the RV semi-amplitude \( K \), then the formula connecting \( K \), \( M_p \), \( M_* \), \( a \).

Wait, recalling another formula for RV semi-amplitude:

\[
K = \frac{v_*}{1} = \frac{M_p}{M_*} \cdot \frac{v_p}{1}
\]

But in reality, because of Newtonian mechanics, the star and planet orbit the common center of mass. So velocity of the star \( v_* \) relates to velocity of the planet \( v_p \) as \( v_* = (M_p / M_*) v_p \).

For a circular orbit, the velocity of the planet is \( v_p = \sqrt{G M_* / a} \). Hence,

\[
v_* = M_p / M_* \cdot \sqrt{G M_* / a} = \frac{M_p}{M_*} \sqrt{G M_* / a}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
K = v_* = \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{M_*}} \sqrt{G / a}
\]

Therefore,

\[
K = \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{M_* a}} \sqrt{G}
\]

But we can solve for \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{G M_p^2}{K^2 M_*}
\]

Therefore, for each planet:

\[
a_1 = \frac{G M_{p1}^2}{K_1^2 M_*}
\]
\[
a_2 = \frac{G M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2 M_*}
\]

Taking the ratio \( a_2 / a_1 \):

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{ \frac{G M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2 M_*} }{ \frac{G M_{p1}^2}{K_1^2 M_*} } = \frac{M_{p2}^2 K_1^2}{M_{p1}^2 K_2^2}
\]

Therefore,

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left( \frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \right)^2 \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^2
\]

This might be a useful relationship.

Alternatively, I found perhaps conflicting derivations above because multiple parameters could be related here. Alternatively, let me ensure this formula:

Starting from:

\[
K = \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{M_* a}} \sqrt{G}
\]

Therefore,

For Planet1,

\[
K_1 = \frac{M_{p1}}{\sqrt{M_* a_1}} \sqrt{G}
\]

For Planet2,

\[
K_2 = \frac{M_{p2}}{\sqrt{M_* a_2}} \sqrt{G}
\]

Taking the ratio \( K_1 / K_2 \):

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Then:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} \right)^2
\]

Got it. Hence:

\[
\frac{a2}{a1} = \left( \frac{K1}{K2} \cdot \frac{Mp2}{Mp1} \right)^2
\]

Now, leave this aside. The critical step is arriving at:

Equilibrium temp ratio = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

From previous:

\[
\frac{T1}{T2} = \sqrt{\frac{a2}{a1}} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{K1}{K2} \cdot \frac{Mp2}{Mp1} \right)^2 } = \frac{K1}{K2} \cdot \frac{Mp2}{Mp1}
\]

Hence,

\[
\frac{T1}{T2} = \left( \frac{K1}{K2} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{Mp2}{Mp1} \right)
\]

Hmm, let's see. Using the formula above.

Yes, because if \( a2 / a1 \) equals \( ( ( K1 / K2 ) * ( Mp2 / Mp1 ) ) squared, then sqrt( a2/a1 ) is exactly K1/K2 * Mp2/Mp1.

Therefore, hence, the temperature ratio is (K1 / K2 ) * (Mp2 / Mp1 )

Okay, but let's verify this logical jump again. Suppose:

We have a_2 / a_1 = ( (K1 * Mp2)/(K2 * Mp1) )^2

Then, sqrt(a_2 / a_1) = (K1 * Mp2)/(K2 * Mp1)

Therefore, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) = (K1 / K2) * (Mp2 / Mp1)

Exactly. So this is a direct relation.

Thus, if I can compute ( (K1 / K2 ) * (Mp2/Mp1) ), that will answer the temperature ratio.

Now, we need to calculate K1 and K2 from the Doppler shifts provided.

Given that for each planet, the maximum Doppler shift is given as a shift in the [OI] line at 6300 Å.

As mentioned previously, the Doppler shift formula is:

Δλ / λ0 = v / c ⇒ v = c * Δλ / λ0

Hence for Planet1, Δλ1 = 0.03 Å, λ0 = 6300 Å:

v1 (K1) = c * 0.03 / 6300

Similarly, Planet2, Δλ2 = 0.04 Å:

v2 (K2) = c * 0.04 / 6300

Therefore,

K1 = (3e8 m/s) * 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 0.03/6300 is of order ~5e-6, so 3e8 * 5e-6 ≈ 1.5e3 m/s

Wait, but have to compute precisely.

Actually, for Planet1:

v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c

c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

So,

(0.03 / 6300) * 3e8 = 0.03 * 3e8 / 6300

= (0.03 * 3e8) / 6300 = (9e6) / 6300 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.

But 9e6 divided by 6300:

6300 × 1428 ≈ 9,000,000 (since 1428.57 × 6.3 = 9000, which is 6.3 thousand, hence 6.3 × 1428.57 ≈ 9000)

Yes:

Compute 9e6 ÷ 6300:

9e6 / 6.3e3 = 9 / 6.3 * 1e3 ≈ 1.42857 * 1e3 ≈ 1428.57 m/s. So K1≈ 1428.57 m/s.

Similarly for Planet2:

v2 = (0.04 / 6300) * 3e8 = (0.04 * 3e8) /6300 = 1.2e7 / 6300 ≈ 1904.76 m/s.

But wait, is it realistic that the RV semi-amplitude is over 1 km/s? That's for a planet. For example, Jupiter induces a RV of about 13 m/s on the Sun. If these values here are 1428 m/s and 1904 m/s, these are way too high. This must indicate that I have messed up the calculation.

Reflecting, [OI] swing of 0.03 Å over 6300 Å. Let me calculate:

Δλ/λ = 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6.

Then velocity v = c * Δλ/λ ≈ 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1428 m/s. That's correct, but do Doppler shifts go up to that?

But such velocities (over 1 km/s) induced by planets seem impossible, as even a Jupiter mass would only cause proximately tens of m/s. Hence, likely an issue here. Therefore, I probably made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, re-examize the problem statement:

" inducing a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å,...the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. "

But wait, if shifts are induced via gravitational microlensing? Alternative—stellar motion induced by planets.

Actually, the Doppler shift measured in the star's spectral lines is a result of the star's velocity toward/away from us due to the planet's gravitational pull. The theoretical maximum velocity semi-amplitude is K.

But even for a Jupiter-like planet (about 318 Earth masses), K is around 13 m/s for a Sun-like star (September for a 1-year period.

But according to the calculations above, the Doppler velocities here are nearly 1.4 km/s and 1.9 km/s, which would imply extremely massive planets or very close orbits. This inconsistency suggests that my assumption may be incorrect. Is the Doppler shift given here as 0.03 Angstrom maybe.

Wait, solution to take on the problem's given values.

Either I trust the problem's given values or not. Assuming there's not an orders-of-magnitude error, and proceed with computed K values just found.

Alternatively, am I confusing Å with something else? But 0.03 Å(x maybe refers to the full width half maximum movement of spectral line? Or, due to irradiation?

Wait, no—the Doppler shift of the star's own spectral line is due to its velocity. In this problem, "periodic Doppler shift" implies via the reflex motion due to the planet. Yet, high masses?

Alternatively, but planets are 7 and 5 Earth masses, which are lower than Neptune (about 17 Earth masses). Given that K for Earth around the Sun is 0.09 m/s. But the Star is 1.5 solar mass.

Wait, standard RV semi-amplitude formula for planets.

Formally, the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / (2 pi c) )^(1/3) / (M_*^(2/3) sqrt(1 - e^2)) ) * ( (2 pi / P ))^(1/3)

But perhaps re-express, as: K is RV semi-amplitude.

Okay, maybe better to calculate K_1 and K_2 using the Doppler shift. Let's recompute numerical values more precisely. While speeds of 10^3 m/s are indeed unreasonable, indicating perhaps an initial error.

AR: Specifying that the shift is in the forbidden line. Forbidden lines are usually in low-density environments, but maybe these are emission lines from the star (unlikely). If the planet's gravity influences the star's atmosphere to emit at shifted wavelengths. But no, natural the Doppler shift is due to the motion of the star.

Given that both Doppler shifts reported—0.03 Å and 0.04 Å—using same spectral line at 6300Å—probably means that they correspond to the velocity of the star induced by each planet.

However, such large velocities seem implausible for planets with 7 and 5 Earth masses. Probably, the units are mistaken: 0.03 and 0.04 mÅ (milliAngstroms) instead of Å? But the problem explicitly states 0.03 Å. Let's assume the question is correct and proceed.

Therefore: K1 =0.03 /6300 * c ，where is that in m/s? 0.03Å /6300Å is 0.03/6300 = 4.7619e-6 → v=4.7619e-6 *c.

But c≈3e8 m/s → v≈4.7619e-6 *3e8 ≈ 1428.57 m/s.

Similarly for K2: 0.04 / 6300 *3e8 ≈ 1904.76 m/s.

So, K1 ≈ 1428.57 m/s, K2 ≈1904.76 m/s.

Now, according to our ratio:

T1/T2 = (K1 / K2) * (M_p2 / M_p1 )

Given that Planet1 has mass 7 Earth masses, Planet2 has 5 Earth masses.

Hence:

M_p2 =5, M_p1=7.

Thus:

(K1/K2)= 1428.57/1904.76≈0.75.

Multiplying by (5/7): 0.75*(5/7)= (3/4)*(5/7)=15/28 ≈0.5357.

Therefore, T1 is about 0.5357 × T2 → T1/T2≈0.5357 → alternatively T1 is cooler than T2.

Since T equilibrium is inversely related to the square root of a, and K and planet mass influence a accordingly. Thus, the conclusion 0.5357 ≈53.6% would be Temp ratio. The ratio T1 / T2 is approximately 15/28 ≅0.5357.

But in the problem, they are probably looking for the exact value.

Thus,

Fraction: (0.03/0.04) * (5/7)

Ah. Wait:

Wait, let's Provide that PI K1 and K2 arepossibly directly the shifts. so K we can preserve the ratio.

As K1 / K2 = (0.03/0.04) = 3/4. Then, SCALED with (M_p2 / M_p1=5/7). Therefore, if temp ratio, which is (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1), that is (3/4)*(5/7)=15/28.

Therefore， this is exact. So, Ratio (T1 / T2)=15/28. Hence, planezbr>

But this leads us to consider whether any gravitational constant, c factors, G, etcetera are assumed to cancel out. But velocity K is related via K1=Δλ1*c/λ0 and K2=Δλ2*c/λ0. Thus their K1/K2 ratio is Δλ1/Δλ2, and multiply by Mp2/Mp1. Hence,

Since lbefore considering units:

Yes. As K's are Δλ scales directly:

Since delta(lambda)/lambda=v/c. Therefore, delta(lambda)=v*lambda/c. Thus, given delta(lambda)_1=0.03, delta(lambda)_2=0.04, divide by same lambda=6300, ergo v1/v2=0.03/0.04=3/4. Hence K1/K2=3/4. Which is why T1 /T2= K1/K2 * (Mp2/Mp1) =0.75*(5/7)=15/28≈0.5357.

Hence, accept this as the conclusion.

But converting 15/28. Simplify 15/28 （=15 divided by28）≅0.5357.

Therefore, ratio of equilibrium temperatures—T1 over T2 equals approximately 0.5357. But needs to be rationalized as a fraction.

Question says "ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2." So the answer is 15⁄28 or sqrt(15/28) sqrt( another expression )?

Wait, back to equilibrium temp formula.

Important to verify one last time whether Temperature indeed scales as sqrt(a2/a1) which is due to (from initial derivation):

T ~ sqrt( R* / 2a) where isn’t There any dependence on star's Teff or luminosity?

Wait no, from the formula:

T_eq = T_eff * sqrt( R* / (2a) ) * (1 - A)^{1/4}

So scaling with T_eff is also there.

But since both planets orbit the same star, T_eff and R_* are constants. Hence, ratio:

T1/T2= sqrt( (R_*/2a1)/(R_*/2a2) )=sqrt( a2/a1 )

Which is = sqrt( ( (K1/K2) * (Mp2 / Mp1) )² ) = | (K1/K2) * (Mp2/Mp1) | ⇒)

Which since K1 and K2 are positive numbers, ratio i>

Therefore:

 ratio = (K1/K2) * (Mp2/Mp1)

Thus, the ratio is (3/4)*(5/7)=15/28 ≅0.5357。

Therefore, the answer is 15/28. However, this must be simplified, but since 15 and 28 share no common factors, So when question asks for the ratio, is written as 15:28 or 15/28. The problem says "ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2" So is likely to expect fractional number: numerator and denominator.

But let me check calculation again using sorted steps.

Step 1: Use Doppler shifts to compute velocity ratio:

V1 / V2 = DeltaLambda1 / DeltaLambda2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4

Step 2: Derivative a2/a1 using:

From radial velocity/doppler/Mass:k scaling:

Given heKm拖 - formula govern a through .

As agreed earlier:

forcing through ratio gives a2/a1 = ( ( (BigKF）*(Mp2 / Mp1) )^2

But higher arrangement步骤）

结论上ratio of a2/a1 = ( ( K1 / K2 ) * ( Mp2 / Mp1 ))^2 )

Thus, ratio T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = ( K1 / K2 ) * ( Mp2 / Mp1 )

As found.

Hence when substituting values.

K1 = .03, K2=0.04, but their ratio 3/4

Mp1=7 Earth Mp2=5 Earth, so ratio Mp2/Mp1=5/7. Multiply(3/4)*(5/7)=15/28.


Therefore, link the ratio 15 to 28. Is this asking for the answer box fraction. Commonly written as two numbers divided.

Hence in teX: \boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}.

Thus, the ratio asserted is $\boxed{\dfrac{15}{28}}$.
