# Original Question

Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).

Let us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.

What would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). 

Flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:

(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. It’s not a typo or something like that.)
(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)

Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. The question is about the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm. Okay, first, I need to recall what the different pp chains are, especially pp-III. 

So, the Sun's energy primarily comes from the proton-proton (pp) chain reactions. There are different branches: pp-I, pp-II, pp-III. From what I remember, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus fuses with a helium-4 nucleus to form beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to become boron-8, which then undergoes beta decay to produce a high-energy neutrino. So, in the pp-III chain, the key product is the B⁸ neutrino, which has a higher energy compared to the other branches.

The problem says that pp-III has stopped, so the reactions producing B⁸ (boron-8) neutrinos would no longer occur. But how does this affect the neutrino fluxes in the specified energy bands?

The neutrino spectrum from the Sun: different reactions produce neutrinos with different energy ranges. Pp-I produces the lowest energy neutrinos, with maximum energy around 0.42 MeV (420 keV). Then in pp-II and pp-III, you get higher energy neutrinos. The B⁸ decay in pp-III produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to about 15 MeV, but the majority would probably be in the higher keV or MeV ranges. 

Wait, but the energy bands in the question are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Let me check. The boron-8 neutrinos have energies up to around 15 MeV, but the average energy is more like 6-7 MeV. The problem is talking about the lower energy bands, so around 0.7-0.9 MeV. That might correspond to a different neutrino source. Wait, maybe the pp chain produces lower energy neutrinos, but then where does CNO cycle neutrinos come in? But the question specifies that only the pp-III branch is stopped. The CNO cycle is not mentioned here, and the problem says all other reactions remain as they were. So perhaps the important point is that pp-III is stopped, which produces the higher energy neutrinos (B⁸ decay), but the other branches (pp-I and pp-II) continue. 

However, if pp-III is stopped, then boron-8 production stops, meaning no B⁸ neutrinos. So before the stoppage, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) would have contributions from different processes. But if the B⁸ neutrinos are higher energy (up to 15 MeV, which is way above 900 keV), maybe the 700-900 keV neutrinos are from other reactions. Hmmm.

Wait, the pp reaction (the first step in the pp chain) emits a neutrino with energy up to 0.42 MeV (420 keV). Then the pep reaction (proton-electron-proton) produces a neutrino line at 1.44 MeV. Then, in the pp-II and pp-III branches, you get Be⁷ electron capture (pp-II has Be⁷ + e⁻ → Li⁷ + ν, which is around 0.86 MeV, maybe?) and B⁸ decay (pp-III) neutrinos up to 15 MeV. So:

- pp: up to 0.42 MeV
- pep: 1.44 MeV
- Be⁷: 0.86 MeV (from electron capture)
- B⁸: up to ≈15 MeV, with average around 7-8 MeV

Wait, the pp-III branch produces the B⁸, which then decay to produce the high-energy neutrinos, but those are in the MeV range. The Be⁷ neutrinos are around 0.86 MeV, which is 860 keV. Which falls into the 800-900 keV band. Therefore, if the pp-III is stopped, the B⁸ neutrinos are no longer produced, so the high energy neutrinos (above 1 MeV) drop, but here the bands are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. 

So band 2 (800-900 keV) probably corresponds to the Be⁷ neutrinos (since 860 keV would be in this band). But let me confirm. The exact energies:

The Be⁷ electron capture reaction in the pp-II branch: Be⁷ + e⁻ → Li⁷ + ν_e. The neutrino energy here is a single line at about 0.862 MeV (862 keV). So that would be in the 800-900 keV band. The pp and CNO cycle would contribute lower energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III is stopped, then only the pp-I and pp-II branches are contributing, but pp-I neutrinos are up to 0.42 MeV, which is below 700 keV, so those don't contribute to either band.

The pep neutrino is at 1.44 MeV (1440 keV), which is higher than both bands. So in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands:

- Band 1 (700-800 keV): Could there be any neutrino sources here? The Be⁷ is at 862 keV, so in band 2. Maybe... Is there another source?

Wait, the pp chain also includes the hep process, producing very high energy neutrinos (up to 18.8 MeV), but those are extremely rare. So not contributing here. Alternatively, the CNO cycle? But the question says that the only change is that the pp-III is stopped; other reactions remain the same, so the CNO cycle is the same as usual. However, CNO neutrinos have energies lower than B⁸ but maybe similar or higher than Be⁷. Let's check. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos from the beta decay of N¹³ and O¹⁵. For example, N¹³ → C¹³ + e⁺ + ν_e, with maximum neutrino energy around 1.2 MeV. O¹⁵ → N¹⁵ + e⁺ + ν_e, with maximum around 1.73 MeV. The neutrinos from these decays would have lower energies on average (beta decay spectrum). So energies up to the maximum, but averaged they might peak lower.

Thus, if we consider 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands, the Be⁷ (862 keV) would be in the higher band. The N¹³ and O¹⁵ neutrinos (from CNO) might have some flux in these bands. But given that the question states that all other reactions remain the same, the stopping of pp-III would remove B⁸ neutrinos (which are higher energy), so the question is about flux ratios in these two bands. But unless those bands are dominated by CNO neutrinos or others, maybe?

Wait a minute. Let me clarify the neutrino sources again. B⁸ decay has neutrinos up to ~15 MeV, which are mostly higher than 5 MeV even. The Be⁷ neutrinos are line at 862 keV. So those would specifically fall into band 2 (800-900 keV). So:

If pp-III is stopped, then B⁸ neutrinos are gone. Be⁷ neutrinos (from pp-II), whose line is in band 2, would continue, since only pp-III is stopped. Wait, but separating the branches: pp-III is the branch where He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷, which then captures a proton to become B⁸. But pp-II is He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ followed by electron capture (without proton capture?), producing Be⁷ + e⁻ → Li⁷ + ν. So the pp-III branch produces B⁸, while pp-II produces Li⁷. So if pp-III is stopped, then the Be⁷ will only be consumed via the pp-II branch (electron capture), producing the 862 keV neutrinos. Previously, some of Be⁷ might have gone into making B⁸ (via proton capture) that leads to higher energy neutrinos, but with pp-III stopped, all Be⁷ goes to pp-II. So, does that mean that the Be⁷ neutrino flux would increase?

Wait, but if pp-III is stopped 8.5 minutes ago, given that neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, the time for them to reach Earth is 8.5 minutes (hence travel time from the Sun to Earth is about that), so stopping the production would immediately (after 8.5 minutes) cut off the B⁸ neutrino flux. But the Be⁷ flux (pp-II) would remain. However, if the pp-III branch was contributing to converting some Be⁷ into B⁸ via proton capture, then removing pp-III would leave that Be⁷ to decay via electron capture (pp-II), thus actually increasing the Be⁷ neutrino flux? But does production of Be⁷ itself depend on previous steps?

Wait, the formation of Be⁷ in the first place is part of the pp-II and pp-III branches. So the process leading to Be⁷ is collision of He³ and He⁴ nuclei: He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ + γ. Then, Be⁷ can either capture an electron (pp-II) producing Li⁷ and a neutrino, or capture a proton (pp-III) producing B⁸, which then decays into Be⁸, emitting a high-energy neutrino. 

If we stop pp-III (the proton capture pathway), then all the Be⁷ would undergo electron capture in pp-II, which would produce more 862 keV neutrinos, all other things being equal. But how does stopping pp-III affect the overall production of Be⁷? If we stop pp-III, then perhaps less He³ is consumed in this branch, which might affect the He³ abundance? But the problem states that only pp-III stops; everything else remains as before. The problem states that all other reactions remained as they were. 

Wait, that might not be realistic, since the different branches are part of the same overall process, but the problem is hypothetical. So if pp-III suddenly stops, we can imagine that Be⁷ is produced as usual (which requires He³ + He⁴), but then instead of it being consumed through pp-III (proton capture), it's only consumed through pp-II (electron capture). So the abundance of Be⁷ in the core would first depend on the production rate and the destruction rate. If we block the destruction channel of Be⁷ via proton capture (pp-III branch), and only allow electron capture (pp-II), then Be⁷ would accumulate until a new equilibrium is established? But wait, that happens on timescales of the nuclear processes.

But since the production of Be⁷ isn't instantaneous. Let me think. The time it takes for the solar core to adjust the abundances would depend on the reaction rates, but the problem states that the neutrinos stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Now, 8.5 minutes is very short on stellar timescales, nuclear reaction timescales are usually longer or same? Probably, 8.5 minutes is about the time it takes for the neutrinos to reach us (Sun to Earth distance), so the material in the Sun wouldn't have adjusted yet. So the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch would, after 8.5 minutes, affect the neutrino flux as follows: the neutrinos produced during the last 8.5 minutes would not include those from the pp-III branch. But if the problem says that pp-III neutrons (sorry, neutrinos) are produced through B⁸ decay, which has a half-life of about 0.8 seconds. So once you stop the production of B⁸ (by halting pp-III), then within less than a second, all B⁸ would decay. But since the neutrinos travel to earth in 8.5 minutes, B⁸ neutrinos would cease to arrive 8.5 minutes after the shutdown. But from the problem statement, assuming that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So if the problem is "now," the observed neutrino flux would no longer include any B⁸ neutrinos, only those from other branches (like pp, Be⁷, pep, CNO). 

But wait, the actual flux we observe "now" (after 8.5 minutes) comes from neutrinos produced 8.5 minutes ago, and the pp-III branch was stopped, effectively making B⁸ production zero from that moment. But the B⁸ decay has a half-life of ~1 second (*checking: B⁸ decay has a half-life of approximately 0.8 seconds), so even if production was stopped 8.5 minutes ago, all B⁸ would have decayed away within a few seconds. So after 8.5 minutes, there would be no B⁸ neutrinos.

So then, the flux in the energy bands given (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after stopping pp-III would be only from non-pp-III sources. Let me see:

Be⁷ neutrino: ~862 keV (inside band 2). Therefore, the neutrino flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would come primarily from Be⁷ in the pp-II branch. 

Then band 1 (700-800 keV) would not receive contributions from Be⁷, which is at 862 keV. So where do neutrinos in this band come from?

Well, the CNO neutrinos. For example, N¹³ decay produces a neutrino spectrum up to 1.2 MeV. The majority of them would be lower than max energy. Similarly, O¹⁵ decays up to 1.7 MeV. So some CNO neutrinos would fall into bands 1 and 2. Also, pep neutrinos (1.44 MeV line) is higher than both bands. The pp neutrinos are up to 0.42 MeV (below both bands). So if pp-III is stopped, band 1 (700-800 keV) might get contributions from the CNO cycle (N¹³ and O¹⁵ decays) as well as maybe any subdominant sources. 

But how significant are the CNO neutrinos compared to Be⁷? I recall that Be⁷ neutrinos make up a significant fraction, but even more so depending on etc.

Wait, actually in the non-stopped Sun, the main neutrino sources are:

- pp: around 90% of the total neutrino flux (but low energy, peaking at ~0.2 MeV)
- Be⁷: ~7% at 0.862 MeV
- pep: ~0.01% at 1.44 MeV
- B⁸: ~0.001% but higher energies (up to 15 MeV, average around 7 MeV)
- CNO: even smaller percentages (if the Sun is primarily pp-chain), maybe around 1% total.

But according to Standard Solar Model, the CNO cycle contributes around 1% of the Sun's energy. However, due to the different neutrino spectra, the neutrino fluxes from CNO are also present but small. But the dominant high-energy neutrinos (before B⁸ shutdown) would come from B⁸. 

But in our problem, after stopping pp-III, we stop B⁸ production, so no B⁸ neutrinos. Therefore, the higher energies (which in our case is B⁸) are gone. But focusing on the 700-900 keV range:

Band 2 (800-900 keV): the main contributor is Be⁷ decay (862 keV). So that's one line contributing entirely to band 2. While band 1 (700-800 keV) could be from the lower end of CNO neutrinos (N¹³ and O¹⁵ decay), maybe some part of their spectra. But the CNO neutrino flux is lower compared to Be⁷? Let's check numbers.

Standard Solar Model (SSM) predictions for neutrino fluxes (units 10^10 cm^-2 s^-1):

- pp: 6.0 × 10^10
- pep: 1.46 × 10^8
- Be⁷: 4.84 × 10^9
- B⁸: 5.00 × 10^6
- N¹³: 2.78 × 10^8
- O¹⁵: 2.05 × 10^8 
- F¹⁷: 5.29 × 10^6

(Ref: Bahcall's solar model, for example)

Thus, Be⁷ flux is around 4.84e9, while CNO (N¹³ and O¹⁵) fluxes are each about 2.8e8 and 2.0e8. But wait:

But these fluxes are the total fluxes, so not just for the specific energy bands. However, Be⁷ is a line at 862 keV (0.862 MeV), which would all fall into band 2 (800-900 keV). The CNO neutrinos, for example, N¹³ has an average energy (~0.706 MeV) which is about 706 keV (source?), which would be in band 1 but the actual highest energy for N¹³ neutrino is up to 1.199 MeV (extending into band 2). Similarly, O¹⁵ has energies up to 1.73 MeV, so extending into higher bands.

So, if we're considering energies in 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), the fluxes here would include some part of the N¹³, O¹, and maybe other sources, but Be⁷'s entire 4.84e9 flux is in band 2. But N¹³ and O¹⁵ in their spectra have a portion within these bands.

However, the actual number in each band depends on the shape of the neutrino energy spectrum. Let's approximate. For beta-decay neutrinos, the spectrum follows the allowed beta decay spectrum, which is a distribution with maximum energy E_max, and the spectrum peaks at lower energies.

For N^13 decay:

Q-value is about 2.22 MeV (though exact numbers depend on isotopes). But okay, let's take data from Bahcall http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/Papers/Preprints/solarmodels.html …

Wait, more details:

Actually, the beta decay of N¹³ (N¹³ → C¹³ + e⁺ + ν_e) has an endpoint energy (maximum neutrino energy) of 1.20 MeV. The average neutrino energy would be about 0.71 MeV (710 keV). So the spectrum would extend up to 1.20 MeV, but most of the neutrinos are in the lower part. Similarly, O¹⁵ decay (O¹⁵ → N¹⁵ + e⁺ + ν_e) has endpoint energy of 1.73 MeV; average around 1.0 MeV.

Therefore, maybe in the band 700-800 keV, the N¹³ neutrinos have a significant contribution. Let's assume that in band 1 (700-800 keV), part of the N¹³ spectrum is present, and similarly in band 2 (800-900 keV), part of N¹³ and O¹⁵ spectra could contribute. But given that N¹³'s spectral average is around 710 keV (~ band 1), while O¹⁵’s average is around 1.0 MeV (~ band 2), and they both span higher and lower ranges.

But given that the flux from Be⁷ is much higher than the CNO fluxes. Without B⁸ (since it's stopped), then:

Within band 1 (700-800 keV):

- Contributions from N¹³ (maybe significant part, average is 710 keV)
- Maybe slight from O¹⁵ (lower end, in band 1 and 2)
- Also, possibly from other sources?

But what's their total in band 1?

In normal neutrino flux, the sum of N¹³ and O¹ vary. If CNO contributes ~1% of the total solar neutrino flux, and even considering their presence in bands 1 and 2, perhaps the importance shifts once B⁸ is removed.

But the natural question is, what fractions of N¹³ and O¹⁵ neutrinos lie in each band.

Assuming an allowed beta spectrum, for N¹³:

Each neutrino is created with a spectrum described by:

(dN/dE) ~ (E_ν²) (Q - E_ν)²

where Q = 1.20 MeV is max energy.

But these neutrinos would populate energies from 0 to 1.20 MeV.

Similarly, O¹: 0 to 1.73 MeV.

But Since we are interested in 0.7-0.8 MeV (band 1), and 0.8-0.9 MeV (band 2):

Let me model both.

Take N¹³ neutrinos. If total N¹³ flux is 2.8e8 cm^{-2} s^{-1}, then in band 1 (700-800 keV), which is 0.7-0.8 MeV, the number that fall in that interval depends on the spectral distribution. Similarly for O¹.

But exactly integrating the spectrum requires knowing the actual shape.

Approximate for order-of-magnitude: 

For N¹³, Avg energy is ~0.71 MeV. So most of that must come in around 0.71 MeV, which is in band 1 (700-800 keV). The Endpoint is at 1.20 MeV, so moving from 0.71 up to 1.20. But assuming the spectral shape is flat? Let's think in terms of fractions.

For beta decay:

The beta spectrum for allowed decays is described by

N(E) ∝ E²(Q - E)² (1 + a (m_e/E)), including phase space and coulomb correction. But probably negligible for placement. For a rough estimate, let’s approximate the proportion.

For N¹³: Q = 1.20 MeV

Let's partition by fractions:

- Band 1: 0.7 to 0.8 MeV (range 0.1 MeV)

Assuming the spectra are roughly Gaussian-like, given that the beta decay spectrum peaks near (Q / 3 ?) Then:

Wait, no. The maximum of the beta spectrum for a beta-minus decay (but here for beta-plus) occurs at around E = Q * (1 - m_e/(2Q)) – but again not sure.

Alternatively, suppose the distribution flattens linearly from 0 to Q. But in reality, it peaks at low energy.

Alternatively, take proportions based on if the entire allowed range is divided into uniform intervals.

But maybe we can compare the expected counts under the curve from 0.7 to 0.8 MeV (band 1), 0.8 to 0.9 MeV (band 2), considering the endpoint.

So as for N¹³, Q = 1.2 MeV:

Integral from 0.7 to 0.8 over E²(1.2 - E)² dE / Integral from 0 to 1.2 over same to get the fraction.

Similarly, assume the flux is normalized: integral from 0 to Q.

The same approach for O¹, but higher Q=1.73 MeV.

But this might be too accurate, but since ratios are requested, we can proceed with the calculation.

However, because this is a problem likely intended to expect that 862 keV of Be⁷ is entirely in band 2. Prior to stopping pp-III, the B⁸ neutrinos may have contributed to higher energy bands (for example, if in addition, other reactions' neutrinos like CNO can contribute to the bands considered here.

But according to the problem statement:

After pp-III is stopped:

- B₈ neutrinos are gone (no contribution to any bands)

- Be₇ flux?

Wait. But the problem states "all other reactions remained as they were." So the pp-II branch isn't affected. Producing Be⁷ and converting to Li⁷ via electron capture as before? Then how would the stoppage of pp-III affect Be⁷'s neutrino?

In the standard scenario, Be⁷ can go either to pp-II or pp-III.

However, if pp-III is turned off, then all Be⁷ would go to pp-II. However, the total rate of Be⁷ neutrinos (electron capture) would increase.

But in reality, the amount of BeC331 is produced depends on the He³ and He⁴ abundance, but in the problem, it says all other reactions are continuing as before. If He³ and He⁴ are being produced at same rates, then the formation rate of Be⁷ is same. But without pp-III, Be⁷ would not be processed into B⁸. So if Be⁷ destruction now is only by electron capture (pp-II), then the equilibrium abundance of Be⁷ would decrease? Wait no: making the same rate of production (He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷) but a lower destruction rate (electron capture but not pp), then lower. Wait:

Be⁷ abundance in equilibrium would be:

Production rate (k1) proportional to [He³][He⁴]
Destruction rate (k2 [Be⁷][p] (for capture to B⁸) + k3 [Be⁷][e⁻] (for EC to Li⁷))

But problem: pp-III (capture to B⁸) is stopped; hence, k2=0 now. So destruction rate is through k3 [Be⁷][e⁻]

Therefore, new equilibrium [Be⁷] = k1 / k3 [ e^- ]

Original equilibrium [Be⁷] was k1 / ( k2 [p] + k3 [e^- ] )

So assuming significant absorption via pp-III branch before, stopping it would cause [Be⁷] to go increase (since denominator was larger before). Wait:

If before the stoppage, destruction rate was higher ( since ( k2[p]+k3[e⁻])),

so the concentration is lower. If destruction rate decreases (onlya k3[e⁻]), then [Be^7] increases until production equals new destruction rate. Hence higher abundance of Be⁷.

But the time it takes to reach the new equilibrium? If a sharp cutoff of pp-III (Which now means that Be⁷ isn't being eaten by proton captures), then the abundance may start to accumulate. But 8.5 minutes is much shorter than the timescale over which nuclear processes occur in the Sun?

The Sun is in hydrostatic equilibrium, so any disruption would take much longer (millions of years). But these are exothermic fusion reactions with timescales typical of nuclear processes. If the Sun's pp-III is suddenly stopped, then Be⁷ would start to accumulate until and this would occur on the timescale determined by Be⁷ lifetimes.

But let's think about processe(Town rely on reaction rates. The production rate of Be⁷ is k1=[He³][He⁴] <σv>

Destruction rate is if previously k_destruction = k2 [Be⁷][p] + k3 [Be⁷][e^- ]. The lifetime of Be⁷ under pp-II [...]”

In reality, the lifetime of Be⁷? Suppose the dominant decay path is via pp-III (if the Sun experimentally has (pp-III) neutrinos existing. Then if we turn off pp-III, Be⁷ might have a longer lifetime but would adjust accordingly.

But realistically, given uncertainties, the question might be in the immediate next few minutes after the shutdown, which would not really affect the solar structure but only the products. So the flux of Be neutrinos (862 keV) would not change immediately because the Be⁷ production and destruction were equilibrium processes.

But suppose that cross-sections are such that prior to turning off pp-III, most Be⁷ was used in pp-III and hence Be⁷ → B⁸. Then, when pp-III is stopped, all Be⁷ would be left to decay via pp-II, increasing the Be⁷ neutrino flux. But how fast?

The Be⁷ electron capture rate is determined by the density of electrons and the cross-section. For example, say the e-fold time is on the scale of minutes. Then over 8.5 minutes, a significant increase in Be⁷ ν flux may not have occurred yet. But againtimes. So trans CRUCIAL.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem intention is much simpler: stopping the pp-III branch (B⁸ production) would eliminate all neutrinos from B⁸. The only neutrino remaining above, say, 800 keV are Be⁷ (862 keV). And perhaps 700-800KeV (band 1) is dominated by CNO neutrinos. Hence, flux(band1)/flux(band2) is (flux(CNO nu in band1))/(flux(Be⁷)]

Given that plot.

But how much do know about CNO contribution. From standard solar model, the CNO ν flux is about an order of magnitude less than Be⁷, but And the Be⁷ are line at 862 keV, while CNO is continuous extending in both bands. So flux in 700-800 (Cno) versus 800-960 (Be'). The approximate ratio would thus be (CNO in band1)/(Be⁷). 

But let's review numbers:

Be⁷ flux: ~5e9 cm^-2 s^-1 exiting the Sun.

CNO fluxes (N¹³ + O¹): (N¹³ ~3e8, O¹ ~2e8)

Assuming both N¹3 and O¹ can Spectrum contribute in band1 and 2.

Assuming a larger portion for N¹³ in band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV since Avg energy is 0.5MeV) Sorry, my earlier muddling. If N¹³ emits up to 1.20MeV peaks somewhere;

But to get a concrete ratio, maybe total fluxes.

If we consider Band1 (700-800 keV).Assuming that in N¹³, the fraction of neutrinos in band would be small: part above 700 keV (Because the average is 0.71 MeV (that's 《700NeV). Source 

Wait, the average energy for N¹³ neutrinos is ~0.706 MeV (https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/personalhomes/tada/solar/neutrino.html), which is ~706 keV, so in band1. If the energy spectrum is as per beta decay, the number in band2 (800-900) will be smaller. Similarly, O¹⁵ has a higher average (~1.0 MeV), so overlaps with band 2.

Assuming of the total N¹3 neutrinos, about half are above average? Maybe not. In a beta spectrum, the average isn't the median. Actually, the beta spectrum is skewed. Let me see:

need to compute the fraction of events in each channel.

Let's suppose the normalized probability distribution for N¹3 decay neutrino energies is P(E) = K*E^2*(Q - E)^2 where Q=1.2MeV and K normalization.

So compute the integral from 0.7-0.8; compare to total flux. The same for O¹ with Q=1.73.

But for order of magnitude:

Not to get bogged down but approximately:

Q for N13 = 1.20MeV

What the ratio between the flux in 0.7-0.8 vs other bands?

Assume:

The problem isin event vast majority of N1SIGNuetrino.s do nothing in 0.7MeV- alto,VGGrav350keV (average 0.706MeV), foure doing sodium the integral:

Integral(E_low=0.7, E_high=0.8) and compare to total Integral(0 to 1.2). Received stellar parameters in a -shown:

Integrated of RN data hasn't right here, but if we separate the integrations, caped shooting:

Assuming in another you step by parameter E =0cubic sev al here:

P(E) = E² (1.2 - E)

Neglecting someMinor terms, and using any numerical values.:

Let’s do a symbolic calculation.. The integral for dN/dE is proportional to E^2 (Q - E)^2.

For Q=1.2 and integral from a to b is: integrate E^2 (1.2 - E)^2 dE from a to b.

But this integral might take some time. However, approximating:

Perhaps the peak is at dP/dE = max. The maximum occurs where derivative of E² (Q - E)^2 is 0.

Taking derivative: 2E(Q - E)^2 - 2E^2(Q - E) =0 → E(Q - E)( (Q - E) - E ) =0 → BAD sum sorry,

Product rule for d/dE [E² (Q-E)^2] =

2E(Q-E)^2 + E²*2(Q-E)(-1) = 2E(Q - E)^2 - 2E²(Q - E).

Set to zero:

2E(Q - E)( (Q - E) - E ) =0

Thus, E(Q - E)(Q - 2E)=0

Solutions:

E=0, E=Q, or Q -2E =0 → E=Q/2=0.6 MeV.

Therefore, maximum at 0.6 MeV for Q=1.2.

So the spectral peak is at 0.6 meV for N13. Which lines 0.6 Mev。

So u should peak below band 1 (700-800). Therefore a falloff.

So most of the neutrinos are below 0.6MeV in N1エス, even though the average is 0.7 MeV？ Strange. Alternatively, peaked at 0.6 MeV but mean at 0.7。

But integrating:

Total integral from 0 to1.2 vs integral from 0.7 to 0.8.

Alternatively, note that possible references, maybe on the how much flux is in each band. But under the assumption of the problem, it's supposed to be a ratio roughly of "~CEA Contribution/ B28 flux after."

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. The question is about the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm. Okay, first, I need to recall what the different pp chains are, especially pp-III. 

So, the Sun's energy primarily comes from the proton-proton (pp) chain reactions. There are different branches: pp-I, pp-II, pp-III. From what I remember, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where a helium-3 nucleus fuses with a helium-4 nucleus to form beryllium-7, which then captures a proton to become boron-8, which then undergoes beta decay to produce a high-energy neutrino. So, in the pp-III chain, the key product is the B⁸ neutrino, which has a higher energy compared to the other branches.

The problem says that pp-III has stopped, so the reactions producing B⁸ (boron-8) neutrinos would no longer occur. But how does this affect the neutrino fluxes in the specified energy bands?

The neutrino spectrum from the Sun: different reactions produce neutrinos with different energy ranges. Pp-I produces the lowest energy neutrinos, with maximum energy around 0.42 MeV (420 keV). Then in pp-II and pp-III, you get higher energy neutrinos. The B⁸ decay in pp-III produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to about 15 MeV, but the majority would probably be in the higher keV or MeV ranges. 

Wait, but the energy bands in the question are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Let me check. The boron-8 neutrinos have energies up to around 15 MeV, but the average energy is more like 6-7 MeV. The problem is talking about the lower energy bands, so around 0.7-0.9 MeV. That might correspond to a different neutrino source. Wait, maybe the pp chain produces lower energy neutrinos, but then where does CNO cycle neutrinos come in? But the question specifies that only the pp-III branch is stopped. The CNO cycle is not mentioned here, and the problem says all other reactions remain as they were. So perhaps the important point is that pp-III is stopped, which produces the higher energy neutrinos (B⁸ decay), but the other branches (pp-I and pp-II) continue. 

However, if pp-III is stopped, then boron-8 production stops, meaning no B⁸ neutrinos. So before the stoppage, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) would have contributions from different processes. But if the B⁸ neutrinos are higher energy (up to 15 MeV, which is way above 900 keV), maybe the 700-900 keV neutrinos are from other reactions. Hmmm.

Wait, the pp reaction (the first step in the pp chain) emits a neutrino with energy up to 0.42 MeV (420 keV). Then the pep reaction (proton-electron-proton) produces a neutrino line at 1.44 MeV. Then, in the pp-II and pp-III branches, you get Be⁷ electron capture (pp-II has Be⁷ + e⁻ → Li⁷ + ν, which is around 0.86 MeV, maybe?) and B⁸ decay (pp-III) neutrinos up to 15 MeV. So:

- pp: up to 0.42 MeV
- pep: 1.44 MeV
- Be⁷: 0.86 MeV (from electron capture)
- B⁸: up to ≈15 MeV, with average around 7-8 MeV

Wait, the pp-III branch produces the B⁸, which then decay to produce the high-energy neutrinos, but those are in the MeV range. The Be⁷ neutrinos are around 0.86 MeV, which is 860 keV. Which falls into the 800-900 keV band. Therefore, if the pp-III is stopped, the B⁸ neutrinos are no longer produced, so the high energy neutrinos (above 1 MeV) drop, but here the bands are 700-800 and 800-900 keV. 

So band 2 (800-900 keV) probably corresponds to the Be⁷ neutrinos (since 860 keV would be in this band). But let me confirm. The exact energies:

The Be⁷ electron capture reaction in the pp-II branch: Be⁷ + e⁻ → Li⁷ + ν_e. The neutrino energy here is a single line at about 0.862 MeV (862 keV). So that would be in the 800-900 keV band. The pp and CNO cycle would contribute lower energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III is stopped, then only the pp-I and pp-II branches are contributing, but pp-I neutrinos are up to 0.42 MeV, which is below 700 keV, so those don't contribute to either band.

The pep neutrino is at 1.44 MeV (1440 keV), which is higher than both bands. So in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands:

- Band 1 (700-800 keV): Could there be any neutrino sources here? The Be⁷ is at 862 keV, so in band 2. Maybe... Is there another source?

Wait, the pp chain also includes the hep process, producing very high energy neutrinos (up to 18.8 MeV), but those are extremely rare. So not contributing here. Alternatively, the CNO cycle? But the question says that the only change is that the pp-III is stopped; other reactions remain the same, so the CNO cycle is the same as usual. However, CNO neutrinos have energies lower than B⁸ but maybe similar or higher than Be⁷. Let's check. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos from the beta decay of N¹³ and O¹⁵. For example, N¹³ → C¹³ + e⁺ + ν_e, with maximum neutrino energy around 1.2 MeV. O¹⁵ → N¹⁵ + e⁺ + ν_e, with maximum around 1.73 MeV. The neutrinos from these decays would have lower energies on average (beta decay spectrum). So energies up to the maximum, but averaged they might peak lower.

Thus, if we consider 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands, the Be⁷ (862 keV) would be in the higher band. The N¹³ and O¹⁵ neutrinos (from CNO) might have some flux in these bands. But given that the question states that all other reactions remain the same, the stopping of pp-III would remove B⁸ neutrinos (which are higher energy), so the question is about flux ratios in these two bands. But unless those bands are dominated by CNO neutrinos or others, maybe?

Wait a minute. Let me clarify the neutrino sources again. B⁸ decay has neutrinos up to ~15 MeV, which are mostly higher than 5 MeV even. The Be⁷ neutrinos are line at 862 keV. So those would specifically fall into band 2 (800-900 keV). So:

If pp-III is stopped, then B⁸ neutrinos are gone. Be⁷ neutrinos (from pp-II), whose line is in band 2, would continue, since only pp-III is stopped. Wait, but separating the branches: pp-III is the branch where He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷, which then captures a proton to become B⁸. But pp-II is He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ followed by electron capture (without proton capture?), producing Be⁷ + e⁻ → Li⁷ + ν. So the pp-III branch produces B⁸, while pp-II produces Li⁷. So if pp-III is stopped, then the Be⁷ will only be consumed via the pp-II branch (electron capture), producing the 862 keV neutrinos. Previously, some of Be⁷ might have gone into making B⁸ (via proton capture) that leads to higher energy neutrinos, but with pp-III stopped, all Be⁷ goes to pp-II. So, does that mean that the Be⁷ neutrino flux would increase?

Wait, but if pp-III is stopped 8.5 minutes ago, given that neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, the time for them to reach Earth is 8.5 minutes (hence travel time from the Sun to Earth is about that), so stopping the production would immediately (after 8.5 minutes) cut off the B⁸ neutrino flux. But the Be⁷ flux (pp-II) would remain. However, if the pp-III branch was contributing to converting some Be⁷ into B⁸ via proton capture, then removing pp-III would leave that Be⁷ to decay via electron capture (pp-II), thus actually increasing the Be⁷ neutrino flux? But does production of Be⁷ itself depend on previous steps?

Wait, the formation of Be⁷ in the first place is part of the pp-II and pp-III branche

# Anthropic completion

The problem at hand is to determine the ratio of neutrino fluxes in the energy bands of 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, assuming that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core abruptly ceased 8.5 minutes ago. To approach this issue, it is essential to first understand the different proton-proton (pp) chain reactions, particularly the pp-III branch.

The Sun's energy is primarily generated through the pp chain reactions, which have several branches: pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-III branch involves the fusion of a helium-3 nucleus with a helium-4 nucleus, forming beryllium-7, which subsequently captures a proton to become boron-8. Boron-8 then undergoes beta decay, producing a high-energy neutrino. The key product of the pp-III chain is the B⁸ neutrino, which possesses a higher energy compared to the neutrinos produced in other branches.

If the pp-III branch is halted, the reactions that generate B⁸ neutrinos would no longer occur. However, to determine how this affects the neutrino fluxes in the specified energy bands, it is crucial to examine the neutrino spectrum from the Sun, as different reactions produce neutrinos with varying energy ranges.

The pp-I branch produces the lowest energy neutrinos, with a maximum energy of approximately 0.42 MeV (420 keV). The pp-II and pp-III branches generate higher energy neutrinos. The B⁸ decay in pp-III produces neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to about 15 MeV, with the majority likely falling in the higher keV or MeV ranges. The Be⁷ electron capture reaction in the pp-II branch produces neutrinos with a single energy line at around 0.862 MeV (862 keV), which falls within the 800-900 keV band specified in the question.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of B⁸ neutrinos, which have energies up to ~15 MeV, would cease. The Be⁷ neutrinos from the pp-II branch, with an energy line at 862 keV, would continue, as only the pp-III branch is affected. The pp-III branch is responsible for converting some Be⁷ into B⁸ via proton capture, leading to higher energy neutrinos. With pp-III stopped, all Be⁷ would decay via the pp-II branch through electron capture, potentially increasing the Be⁷ neutrino flux.

Given that neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, stopping the pp-III branch 8.5 minutes ago would result in an immediate cutoff of the B⁸ neutrino flux after 8.5 minutes, which is the approximate travel time from the Sun to Earth. The Be⁷ flux from the pp-II branch would persist, and with the pp-III branch no longer converting some Be⁷ into B⁸, the Be⁷ neutrino flux might actually increase.

In conclusion, the stoppage of the pp-III branch would eliminate the high-energy B⁸ neutrinos, while the Be⁷ neutrinos from the pp-II branch, which fall into the 800-900 keV band, would continue and potentially increase in flux. The 700-800 keV band might not have significant contributions from the pp chain reactions, as the pp-I neutrinos have energies below this range, and the CNO cycle neutrinos are not mentioned to be affected in the given scenario.

Alright, let's work through this problem. The question asks about the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Hmm. First, I need to remember the different pp chains, especially pp-III.

The Sun's energy primarily comes from proton-proton (pp) chain reactions, which have different branches: pp-I, pp-II, pp-III. From what I recall, the pp-III branch involves helium-3 fusing with helium-4 to form beryllium-7, which captures a proton to become boron-8, which then undergoes beta decay to produce a high-energy neutrino. The B⁸ neutrino from the pp-III chain is key and has a higher energy compared to other branches.

The problem states that pp-III has stopped, so reactions producing B⁸ neutrinos would no longer occur. But how does this impact the neutrino fluxes in the given energy bands?

The Sun's neutrino spectrum results from different reactions producing neutrinos at different energy ranges. Pp-I produces the lowest energy neutrinos, with a maximum energy of about 0.42 MeV (420 keV), while pp-II and pp-III produce higher energy neutrinos. B⁸ decays in pp-III produce neutrinos with a continuous spectrum up to about 15 MeV, mostly in higher keV or MeV ranges.

However, the energy bands in the question are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. The boron-8 neutrinos have energies up to around 15 MeV, with an average energy around 6-7 MeV. The question pertains to the lower energy bands, approximately 0.7-0.9 MeV, which might correspond to a different neutrino source. The pp chain produces lower energy neutrinos, but the CNO cycle is not mentioned, and the question indicates no changes in other reactions but the stopping of the pp-III branch.

If pp-III has stopped, boron-8 production stops, meaning no B⁸ neutrinos. Previously, flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) included different processes. High-energy B⁸ neutrinos would have been roughly 15 MeV, significantly exceeding 900 keV, thus suggesting that 700-900 keV neutrinos are from other reactions.

The pp reaction (first step in the pp chain) emits neutrinos up to 0.42 MeV (420 keV). The pep reaction (proton-electron-proton) produces neutrino lines at 1.44 MeV. In the pp-II and pp-III branches, we have Be⁷ electron capture (pp-II: Be⁷ + e⁻ → Li⁷ + ν at about 0.86 MeV) and B⁸ decay (pp-III) neutrinos up to 15 MeV. So:

- pp: up to 0.42 MeV
- pep: 1.44 MeV
- Be⁷: 0.86 MeV (from electron capture)
- B⁸: up to ≈15 MeV, average around 7-8 MeV

The pp-III branch produces B⁸, which decays into high-energy neutrinos, usually in the MeV range. Be⁷ neutrinos are about 0.86 MeV, which is 860 keV, falling into the 800-900 keV band. Therefore, with the cessation of pp-III, B⁸ neutrinos cease, dropping high-energy neutrinos (above 1 MeV), while we're discussing the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands.

So, band 2 (800-900 keV) likely corresponds to the Be⁷ neutrinos, as 860 keV falls into this band. Let's confirm. The energies are:

The Be⁷ electron capture reaction in the pp-II branch: Be⁷ + e⁻ → Li⁷ + ν_e. The neutrino energy here is at about 0.862 MeV (862 keV), within the 800-900 keV band. While the pp and CNO cycles contribute lower energy neutrinos, with pp-III halted, only the pp-I and pp-II branches contribute. The pp-I neutrinos are below 0.42 MeV, thus not contributing to either band.

The pep neutrino stands at 1.44 MeV (1440 keV), exceeding both bands. Therefore, within 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands:

- Band 1 (700-800 keV): Are there any neutrino sources here? With Be⁷ at 862 keV in band 2, is there another source available?

The pp chain also includes the hep process, yielding very high-energy neutrinos (up to 18.8 MeV), but these are extremely rare. Alternatively, the CNO cycle? Since the question notes only the stoppage of the pp-III, all other reactions remain, keeping the CNO cycle unchanged. However, CNO neutrinos are generally lower in energy than B⁸ but possibly similar or slightly higher than Be⁷. N¹³ and O¹⁵ beta decay (N¹³ → C¹³ + e⁺ + ν_e to max 1.2 MeV; O¹⁵ → N¹⁵ + e⁺ + ν_e to max 1.73 MeV) could yield up to these max energies, but averages would likely be lower.

Thus, in 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands, Be⁷ (862 keV) resides in the higher band. Meanwhile, N¹³ and O¹⁵ neutrinos (from CNO) might have relevant flux in these bands. However, given the question's focus on reaction constancy besides pp-III suspension, the flux changes require consideration. Stopping pp-III negates B⁸ neutrinos (higher energy), affecting flux ratios in these bands, but unless dominated by CNO neutrinos?

Checking again: B⁸ decays provide neutrinos up to ~15 MeV, predominantly exceeding 5 MeV. Be⁷ neutrinos occur at 862 keV, thus in band 2 (800-900 keV).

If pp-III ceases, B⁸ neutrinos vanish, while Be⁷ neutrinos (from pp-II) persist, given that only pp-III halts. But additional branch clarification: pp-III involves He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ + proton → B⁸. Meanwhile, pp-II's path follows He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷, followed by electron capture (without proton conversion), leading to Be⁷ + e⁻ → Li⁷ + ν. Thus, pp-III yields B⁸, while pp-II results in Li⁷. If pp-III halts, Be⁷ uptake occurs solely via electron capture (pp-II), potentially heightening Be⁷ neutrino flux. Does Be⁷ production rely on antecedent steps?

With pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago and neutrinos traveling at near light speed, arrival at Earth takes 8.5 minutes—thus stopping B⁸ neutrino flux essentially during this period. The Be⁷ (pp-II) flux persists. Still, if pp-III converted some Be⁷ into B⁸ via proton capture, removing pp-III leaves Be⁷ to undergo electron capture (pp-II), possibly intensifying Be⁷ neutrino flux. But does Be⁷ creation depend on earlier steps?

The problem involves determining the ratio of neutrino fluxes in two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. 

1. **Key Reactions and Neutrino Sources**:
   - The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos (up to 15 MeV) from the decay of boron-8 (B⁸). These neutrinos do not contribute to the specified energy bands (700-900 keV).
   - The pp-II branch produces beryllium-7 (Be⁷) neutrinos via electron capture, resulting in a line at 862 keV, which falls within the 800-900 keV band.
   - The CNO cycle produces neutrinos from nitrogen-13 (N¹³) and oxygen-15 (O¹⁵) with average energies around 0.7 MeV and 0.8 MeV, respectively, contributing to both energy bands.

2. **Impact of Stopping pp-III**:
   - Stopping the pp-III branch halts the production of B⁸ neutrinos, which do not affect the specified energy bands.
   - The Be⁷ neutrino flux (862 keV) remains unchanged as the timescale for changes in Be⁷ abundance is much longer than 8.5 minutes.
   - The CNO neutrino flux remains unaffected as other reactions continue normally.

3. **Flux Contributions**:
   - The Be⁷ neutrino flux (862 keV) dominates the 800-900 keV band.
   - The CNO neutrinos contribute to both bands, with N¹³ primarily in the 700-800 keV band and O¹⁫ spanning both bands.

4. **Flux Ratio Calculation**:
   - The Be⁷ flux is approximately \(4.8 \times 10^9 \, \text{cm}^{-2} \text{s}^{-1}\).
   - The CNO flux is approximately \(5 \times 10^8 \, \text{cm}^{-2} \text{s}^{-1}\), split between the two bands.
   - Assuming the CNO flux is roughly split between the bands, the ratio of fluxes is dominated by the Be⁷ flux in the 800-900 keV band.

5. **Approximate Ratio**:
   - The ratio of flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV) is approximately 0.1, considering the dominance of Be⁷ neutrinos in band 2 and the smaller contribution from CNO neutrinos.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

The pp chain starts with p + p → D + e⁺ + ν (pp neutrino). Then D + p → He³. Then He³ can either combine with another He³ to form He⁴ + 2p (pp-I), or He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ (pp-II and pp-III). So the production of Be⁷ is from He³ + He⁴. If pp-III is stopped, but pp-II continues, then the Be⁷ would still be produced. But in the case of pp-III, Be⁷ captures a proton to become B⁸, which then beta decays. If pp-III is stopped, then Be⁷ can't capture a proton, so it would instead undergo electron capture (pp-II) to become Li⁷. Therefore, the amount of Be⁷ would decrease over time as it's converted into Li⁷ via electron capture. But how quickly does that happen?

Wait, the timescale for the pp-III branch: the Be⁷ + p → B⁸ + γ reaction. If that's stopped, then the Be⁷ would decay via electron capture (with a half-life of about 53 days, if I recall correctly). Wait, but in the Sun's core, the density and temperature are high, so the electron capture rate might be faster. Wait, but in reality, the Be⁷ electron capture in the Sun is a process that occurs in the pp-II branch, and the timescale is much shorter than 53 days because of the high density of electrons in the solar core. So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the Be⁷ would be consumed via electron capture (pp-II) on a timescale of, say, days? But the question says the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So, 8.5 minutes is not enough time for the Be⁷ abundance to change significantly, because the timescale for electron capture is longer. Therefore, the flux of Be⁷ neutrinos (862 keV) would remain roughly the same as before, because the Be⁷ is still present and decaying via electron capture. However, the B⁸ production has stopped, so the B⁸ neutrinos (which are higher energy) would disappear after 8.5 minutes. But the question is about the flux in 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. The Be⁷ line is at 862 keV, which is in band 2 (800-900). So, if the pp-III is stopped, the B⁸ neutrinos (which are higher energy) are gone, but the Be⁷ neutrinos (band 2) remain. What about band 1 (700-800 keV)? Are there other neutrinos in that range?

The pp neutrinos go up to 420 keV, so they are below band 1. The pep neutrinos are at 1.44 MeV, which is above both bands. The CNO neutrinos (N¹³ and O¹⁵) have maximum energies of 1.2 and 1.73 MeV, respectively, but their spectra are continuous. The average energy of N¹³ neutrinos is around 0.7 MeV (700 keV), and O¹⁵ is around 0.8 MeV (800 keV). So, the CNO neutrinos might contribute to both bands. But if the CNO cycle is still active (since only pp-III is stopped), then their contribution remains. However, in the standard solar model, the CNO cycle contributes a small fraction compared to the pp chain. But in the Sun, the dominant neutrino sources are pp, pep, Be⁷, B⁸, and CNO. If B⁸ is stopped, then the remaining neutrinos are pp, pep, Be⁷, and CNO. 

But in the energy bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV, the main contributors would be the CNO neutrinos (N¹³ and O¹⁵) and the Be⁷ line. The Be⁷ line is at 862 keV (band 2). The N¹³ and O¹⁵ neutrinos have a spectrum that might span both bands. For example, N¹³ decay has a maximum energy of 1.2 MeV, so the spectrum would start from 0 up to 1.2 MeV, with a peak around 0.7 MeV. Similarly, O¹⁵ has a maximum of 1.73 MeV, with a peak around 0.8 MeV. So, in band 1 (700-800 keV), you might have contributions from the higher end of N¹³ and the lower end of O¹⁵. In band 2 (800-900 keV), you have the Be⁷ line and the lower part of O¹⁵ and higher part of N¹³. 

But if the pp-III branch is stopped, the CNO cycle is unaffected. So the CNO neutrino flux remains the same. The Be⁷ neutrino flux (band 2) also remains the same, as the timescale for Be⁷ depletion is longer than 8.5 minutes. The B⁸ neutrinos (which are higher energy) are gone, but they don't contribute to these bands. So, the ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2 would be determined by the CNO contributions and the Be⁷ line. 

But wait, if the Be⁷ line is in band 2, and the CNO neutrinos contribute to both bands, then the flux in band 2 would be the sum of Be⁷ and CNO (O¹⁵ and N¹³) in that range, while band 1 is only CNO (N¹³ and O¹⁵). But how significant is the Be⁷ line compared to the CNO flux in band 2?

In the standard solar model, the Be⁷ neutrino flux is about 4.8×10^9 cm⁻² s⁻¹, while the N¹³ and O¹⁵ fluxes are around 2×10^8 and 2×10^8 cm⁻² s⁻¹, respectively. So the Be⁷ flux is an order of magnitude higher than the CNO fluxes. Therefore, in band 2, the Be⁷ line would dominate over the CNO contribution. In band 1, only the CNO neutrinos contribute. 

Therefore, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the B⁸ neutrinos (which are higher energy) are gone, but the Be⁷ and CNO neutrinos remain. So the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) is dominated by Be⁷ (862 keV), and band 1 (700-800 keV) is dominated by CNO. Since Be⁷ flux is higher than CNO, the ratio Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would be approximately (CNO flux in band1)/(Be⁷ flux + CNO flux in band2). But since Be⁷ is much larger, the ratio would be roughly (CNO flux in band1)/(Be⁷ flux). 

But we need to estimate the CNO contribution in each band. Let's say the N¹³ and O¹⁵ neutrinos have spectra that spread across the bands. For N¹³, the average energy is ~0.7 MeV (700 keV), so a significant part of its flux would be in band 1. For O¹⁵, average energy ~0.8 MeV (800 keV), so part of its flux is in band 1 and part in band 2. 

But the exact distribution would require integrating the neutrino spectrum over each band. However, given that the problem is approximate, maybe we can make a rough estimate. If the CNO flux in band 1 is similar to that in band 2, but the Be⁷ flux in band 2 is much larger, then the ratio would be small. 

Alternatively, if the entire CNO flux in both bands is much less than the Be⁷ flux in band 2, then the ratio would be approximately (CNO_band1)/(Be⁷_band2). Given that Be⁷ is ~5e9 and CNO is ~2e8 each, so total CNO in both bands would be maybe ~4e8 (if half of each is in each band), so Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) ≈ (2e8)/(5e9 + 2e8) ≈ 2/52 ≈ 0.038, so about 4%. But this is a rough estimate. 

But wait, the problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. So, if pp-III is stopped, the Be⁷ that would have gone into pp-III (proton capture) now remains to decay via pp-II (electron capture). But does that increase the Be⁷ neutrino flux? Because previously, some Be⁷ was being consumed by pp-III to make B⁸, but now all Be⁷ is decaying via pp-II. So the Be⁷ neutrino flux would increase. 

Wait, but the timescale: if the pp-III branch is stopped 8.5 minutes ago, which is the time it takes for neutrinos to reach Earth. So, the change in the solar core would take 8.5 minutes to affect the neutrino flux here. But the Be⁷ has a certain lifetime. If the Be⁷ is being produced at a certain rate, and if pp-III is a significant channel for consuming Be⁷, then stopping pp-III would lead to an increase in Be⁷ abundance over time, which would then increase the Be⁷ neutrino flux. But the timescale for Be⁷ to adjust depends on the solar core's timescales. 

In the Sun, the pp chains are in equilibrium, so the production and consumption rates of each isotope are balanced. If we suddenly stop pp-III, the Be⁷ would start to accumulate until a new equilibrium is reached where all Be⁷ is consumed by pp-II. However, the timescale for this depends on the Be⁷ lifetime. If the Be⁷ electron capture timescale is short (say, hours or days), then within 8.5 minutes, the Be⁷ abundance might not have changed much. Therefore, the Be⁷ neutrino flux would remain roughly the same as before, because the change hasn't had time to propagate through the solar core's equilibrium. 

Alternatively, if the Be⁷ is consumed quickly via pp-II once pp-III is stopped, then the Be⁷ neutrino flux would increase. But I need to recall the timescales. 

In the solar core, the Be⁷ + e⁻ → Li⁷ + ν_e reaction rate depends on the electron density and the cross-section. The Be⁷ half-life in the solar core is actually very short due to the high electron density. Wait, in the laboratory, Be⁷ has a half-life of 53 days, but in the Sun's core, the electron density is much higher, so the electron capture rate is much faster. 

According to some references, the Be⁷ electron capture in the Sun occurs on a timescale of about a few hundred days. Wait, but that's still longer than 8.5 minutes. So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the Be⁷ that was previously being consumed by proton capture (to form B⁸) would now only be consumed by electron capture. But since the timescale for electron capture is hundreds of days, the Be⁷ abundance would start to increase over time. However, 8.5 minutes is negligible compared to hundreds of days, so the Be⁷ abundance would not have changed significantly. Therefore, the Be⁷ neutrino flux (862 keV) would remain approximately the same as before. 

Therefore, the only change is the removal of B⁸ neutrinos, which are higher energy (MeV range) and don't contribute to the 700-900 keV bands. Therefore, the fluxes in bands 1 and 2 are unaffected by the stoppage of pp-III, except for the CNO contributions. Wait, but the CNO cycle is not affected. So, the flux ratio would remain as it was before the stoppage. But the question is, what is the ratio after the stoppage? 

But if the pp-III branch is stopped, the B⁸ neutrinos are gone, but they don't contribute to these bands. The Be⁷ and CNO neutrinos are still present. Therefore, the flux ratio between band 1 and band 2 would be determined by the CNO and Be⁷ contributions. 

In the standard solar model, the Be⁷ neutrino flux is about 4.8×10^9 cm⁻² s⁻¹, and the CNO flux (N¹³ + O¹⁵) is about 4×10^8 cm⁻² s⁻¹. The Be⁷ line is at 862 keV (band 2), and the CNO neutrinos have a spectrum that might contribute to both bands. 

Assuming that the CNO flux is split roughly equally between the two bands (since their average energies are around 700 and 800 keV), then band 1 would have ~2×10^8 (from N¹³) and band 2 would have ~2×10^8 (from O¹⁵) plus 4.8×10^9 (Be⁷). Therefore, the ratio would be (2e8)/(2e8 + 4.8e9) ≈ 2e8 / 5e9 ≈ 0.04, so about 4%. 

But this is a rough estimate. However, the actual energy spectra of N¹³ and O¹⁵ might have more flux in certain bands. For example, N¹³ decay has a maximum energy of 1.2 MeV, so the spectrum would have a tail up to that. The average energy is about 0.7 MeV, so most of the flux would be below 800 keV. Similarly, O¹⁵ has an average energy of 0.8 MeV, so its flux would be spread around that, contributing to both bands. 

If we assume that N¹³ contributes mostly to band 1 and O¹⁵ to band 2, then the CNO flux in band 1 is ~2e8 (N¹³) and band 2 is ~2e8 (O¹⁵). Adding the Be⁷ flux to band 2 (4.8e9), the ratio would be 2e8 / (2e8 + 4.8e9) ≈ 2/50 ≈ 0.04. 

Alternatively, if the CNO flux is distributed such that both N¹³ and O¹⁵ contribute to both bands, but let's say 70% of N¹³ is in band 1 and 30% in band 2, and 30% of O¹⁵ in band 1 and 70% in band 2. Then:

CNO_band1 = 0.7*2e8 + 0.3*2e8 = (1.4e8 + 0.6e8) = 2e8

CNO_band2 = 0.3*2e8 + 0.7*2e8 = (0.6e8 + 1.4e8) = 2e8

So even with this distribution, CNO contributes equally to both bands. Then band 1 has 2e8, band 2 has 2e8 + 4.8e9 ≈ 5e9. So the ratio is 2e8 / 5e9 = 0.04. 

Therefore, regardless of the distribution, the ratio is approximately 0.04, or 4%. However, the problem might expect a different approach. 

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces some neutrinos in these bands. But pp-III produces B⁸ neutrinos which are higher energy (up to 15 MeV), so they don't contribute to 700-900 keV. Therefore, stopping pp-III doesn't affect these bands. Then the flux ratio remains as usual. But in reality, the Be⁷ neutrino line is in band 2, and CNO contributes to both bands. So the ratio would be (CNO_band1)/(Be⁷ + CNO_band2). If CNO is much smaller than Be⁷, then the ratio is roughly CNO_band1 / Be⁷. 

But according to standard solar model fluxes:

- Be⁷: ~5e9 cm⁻² s⁻¹

- N¹³: ~3e8 cm⁻² s⁻¹

- O¹⁵: ~2e8 cm⁻² s⁻¹

Total CNO: ~5e8 cm⁻² s⁻¹

Assuming half of CNO is in each band, then:

Flux(band1) = 2.5e8

Flux(band2) = 5e9 + 2.5e8 ≈ 5.25e9

Ratio: 2.5e8 / 5.25e9 ≈ 0.0476 ≈ 5%

But the answer might be approximately 0.1 (10%) or 0.2 (20%), but according to these numbers, it's about 5%. However, the problem says "approximate ratio", so maybe the answer is 0.1 or 0.2. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. If the pp-III branch is stopped, does that affect the production of Be⁷? Because pp-III is He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷, then Be⁷ + p → B⁸. If pp-III is stopped, does that mean that the He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ reaction is stopped? Wait, no. The pp-III branch is part of the overall pp chain. The He³ can either combine with another He³ (pp-I), or with He⁴ (pp-II and pp-III). If pp-III is stopped, does that mean that the He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ reaction is also stopped? Or is the pp-III branch referring specifically to the Be⁷ + p → B⁸ part?

This is crucial. The pp-III branch is defined as the path where He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷, followed by Be⁷ + p → B⁸, which then decays. So if pp-III is stopped, it's the Be⁷ + p → B⁸ reaction that stops. The He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ would still continue, but the Be⁷ would not be able to capture a proton to form B⁸. Therefore, the Be⁷ would accumulate until it decays via electron capture (pp-II). But as before, the timescale for electron capture is long (hundreds of days in the Sun), so after 8.5 minutes, the Be⁷ abundance hasn't changed much. Therefore, the production rate of Be⁷ via He³ + He⁴ continues, but the consumption via pp-III stops. However, since the timescale for Be⁷ electron capture is long, the Be⁷ abundance would start to increase, but over a longer period. 

However, the neutrino flux from Be⁷ is proportional to the Be⁷ abundance. If the abundance hasn't changed much in 8.5 minutes, the flux remains the same. Therefore, the only effect is the removal of B⁸ neutrinos, which don't affect the bands in question. Therefore, the flux ratio remains as it was before. 

But the problem states that the pp-III branch is stopped, so the B⁸ production stops. The Be⁷ production continues (since He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ is part of pp-II and pp-III?), but if pp-III is stopped, does that mean that the He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ reaction is also stopped? No, because pp-II and pp-III both start with He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷. The difference is what happens to the Be⁷: in pp-II, it captures an electron; in pp-III, it captures a proton. So if pp-III is stopped, the Be⁷ can only proceed via pp-II. But the initial production of Be⁷ (He³ + He⁴) is part of both branches. Therefore, stopping pp-III would mean that the Be⁷ is no longer consumed by proton capture, but the production of Be⁷ continues as before. Therefore, the Be⁷ abundance would increase over time, leading to an increase in Be⁷ neutrino flux. 

But again, the timescale is important. If the Be⁷ abundance increases, the Be⁷ neutrino flux would increase. However, 8.5 minutes is not enough time for the Be⁷ abundance to change significantly, given the longer timescales of the solar fusion processes. Therefore, the Be⁷ neutrino flux remains roughly the same. 

Therefore, the flux ratio between band 1 and band 2 is determined by the CNO and Be⁷ contributions as before. If originally, the ratio was (CNO_band1)/(Be⁷_band2 + CNO_band2), and if CNO is much smaller than Be⁷, then the ratio is approximately CNO_band1 / Be⁷_band2. 

Given that CNO fluxes are about 5e8 and Be⁷ is 5e9, the ratio is about 0.1. But earlier calculation suggested 0.04-0.05. However, if the CNO flux in band 1 is 5e8 and Be⁷ in band 2 is 5e9, the ratio is 0.1. 

But wait, the total CNO flux is about 5e8, but spread over their energy spectra. If half of the CNO flux is in band 1 and half in band 2, then CNO_band1 = 2.5e8, CNO_band2 = 2.5e8. Then the ratio is 2.5e8 / (5e9 + 2.5e8) ≈ 2.5/52.5 ≈ 0.0476, which is ~5%. 

But maybe the CNO flux is more concentrated in band 1. For example, N¹³ has average energy 0.7 MeV, so most of its flux is in band 1, and O¹⁵ has average 0.8 MeV, so part in band 1 and part in band 2. If N¹³ is 3e8 and O¹⁵ is 2e8, then:

N¹³ in band 1: 2e8

N¹³ in band 2: 1e8

O¹⁵ in band 1: 1e8

O¹⁵ in band 2: 1e8

Total CNO_band1: 3e8

CNO_band2: 2e8

Then ratio: 3e8 / (5e9 + 2e8) ≈ 3/52 ≈ 0.0577 (~6%). 

Still around 5-6%. 

But the problem says "approximate ratio". In some references, the Be⁷ neutrino flux is about 4.8e9, and the CNO sum is about 5e8. If we take the CNO flux as 10% of Be⁷, and assume that half of CNO is in band 1 and half in band 2, then the ratio is (0.05*Be⁷) / (Be⁷ + 0.05*Be⁷) ≈ 0.05/1.05 ≈ 0.0476, which is ~5%. 

But maybe the answer is 0.1 (10%), considering that CNO might contribute more to band 1. Alternatively, if the CNO flux in band 1 is comparable to Be⁷ flux in band 2, but that's not the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. The pp-III branch produces B⁸ neutrinos (high energy), and the Be⁷ neutrinos (862 keV) are from pp-II. If pp-III is stopped, the Be⁷ production continues, and since the Be⁷ can't be consumed by proton capture (pp-III), it must decay via electron capture (pp-II), which would increase the Be⁷ neutrino flux. But does this happen immediately? 

If the timescale for Be⁷ to adjust is short compared to 8.5 minutes, then the Be⁷ neutrino flux would increase. But in reality, the solar core's timescale for adjusting to changes is much longer. For example, the photon diffusion time is thousands of years, but neutrino production timescales are related to nuclear reaction rates. 

The He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ reaction rate depends on the density and temperature. If pp-III is stopped, the Be⁷ production continues, but the consumption via pp-III stops. The Be⁷ abundance would then start to increase until the electron capture rate (pp-II) balances the production rate. The timescale for this adjustment is the Be⁷ lifetime divided by the fraction of Be⁷ consumed by pp-III. 

If originally, a fraction f of Be⁷ was consumed by pp-III, and (1-f) by pp-II, then stopping pp-III would cause the Be⁷ abundance to increase by a factor of 1/(1-f) over its lifetime. But if the lifetime is long, the change is negligible after 8.5 minutes. 

Assuming that the Be⁷ lifetime in the core is, say, 100 days, then 8.5 minutes is negligible, so the Be⁷ abundance and neutrino flux remain the same. Therefore, the flux ratio is determined by the original CNO and Be⁷ contributions. 

Given that, the ratio is approximately CNO_band1 / (Be⁷_band2 + CNO_band2) ≈ 5e8 / 5e9 = 0.1. But wait, if CNO is 5e8 total, split between bands, and Be⁷ is 5e9 in band 2, then the ratio is (CNO_band1) / (Be⁷ + CNO_band2). If CNO is split equally, then 2.5e8 / (5e9 + 2.5e8) ≈ 0.0476. If CNO is mostly in band 1, say 4e8 in band1 and 1e8 in band2, then 4e8 / (5e9 +1e8) ≈ 0.078 (~8%). 

But the problem is from an exam or textbook, and the answer is likely a simple ratio. Given that the Be⁷ line is in band 2 and CNO contributes to band 1, and the Be⁷ flux is about 10 times the CNO flux, the ratio would be roughly 1/10, so 0.1. 

Alternatively, if the Be⁷ flux is 5e9 and CNO in band1 is 5e8, then 5e8 /5e9=0.1. But that assumes all CNO is in band1, which isn't the case. 

Alternatively, the question might be trickier. If pp-III is stopped, the Be⁷ that would have been used in pp-III is now available to decay via pp-II, so the Be⁷ neutrino flux increases. But does this happen immediately? 

If the production rate of Be⁷ is R, and the destruction rate via pp-III was R_III and via pp-II was R_II, then in equilibrium R = R_III + R_II. If pp-III is stopped, the new equilibrium will have R = R_II', so R_II' = R. Therefore, the Be⁷ abundance N = R_II' * τ, where τ is the lifetime. Originally, N = (R_III + R_II) * τ. If R_III is stopped, then N starts to increase until R_II' = R. But this adjustment happens over the timescale τ. If τ is much longer than 8.5 minutes, then the change in N is negligible. 

Assuming τ is long, the flux from Be⁷ remains the same. Therefore, the ratio is determined by original fluxes. 

In the standard solar model, the Be⁷ flux is ~5e9, CNO ~5e8. If CNO is spread between bands 1 and 2, and Be⁷ is entirely in band 2, then the ratio is (CNO_band1) / (Be⁷ + CNO_band2). If CNO is split 50-50, then 2.5e8 / (5e9 +2.5e8) ≈ 0.0476. If CNO is mostly in band1, say 80% in band1, then 4e8 / (5e9 +1e8) ≈ 0.078. 

But the problem states that flavor changes do not play a role, so we don't have to consider neutrino oscillations. 

Given the possible answers and the approximate nature, the answer is likely 0.1 or 0.2. But based on calculations, it's closer to 0.05. However, considering that the CNO flux might be more concentrated in band1 and the Be⁷ is entirely in band2, the ratio could be CNO_total / Be⁷ ≈ 0.1. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is simpler: the pp-III branch produces the high-energy B⁸ neutrinos, and the Be⁷ line is from pp-II. If pp-III is stopped, the Be⁷ production continues, but since B⁸ is stopped, the only high-energy neutrinos gone. But the Be⁷ line is still there. The lower energy bands (700-900 keV) are unaffected because B⁸ neutrinos are higher energy. Therefore, the flux ratio between 700-800 and 800-900 keV remains the same as before. 

But what was the original ratio? If originally, band2 had Be⁲ line (862 keV) and some CNO, and band1 had CNO, then the ratio was (CNO_band1)/(Be⁷ + CNO_band2). If CNO is much smaller, the ratio is ~0.1. 

Given that, the answer is approximately 0.1. So the ratio is 1:10, flux(band1)/flux(band2)=0.1. 

But I need to check standard references. According to the solar neutrino spectrum, the Be⁷ line is at 0.862 MeV, which is in band2 (800-900 keV). The CNO neutrinos (N¹³ and O¹⁵) have spectra peaking around 0.7 and 0.8 MeV. The fluxes are:

- Be⁷: ~5e9 cm⁻² s⁻¹

- N¹³: ~3e8 cm⁻² s⁻¹

- O¹⁵: ~2e8 cm⁻² s⁻¹

So total CNO: ~5e8. 

Assuming that the N¹³ spectrum is mostly below 800 keV and O¹⁵ spans both bands, then band1 (700-800 keV) would have most of N¹³ and part of O¹⁵, say 4e8, and band2 (800-900 keV) would have the rest of O¹⁵ (1e8) plus Be⁷ (5e9). Then the ratio is 4e8 / (5e9 +1e8) ≈ 4/51 ≈ 0.078 (~8%). 

But since the problem asks for an approximate ratio, and given the options, 0.1 is the closest. However, in some sources, the ratio of CNO to Be⁷ is about 0.1, so the answer is likely 0.1. 

But I'm still a bit uncertain. Another approach: the pp-III branch produces B⁸, which decays to produce high-energy neutrinos. These are not in the bands we're considering. The Be⁷ neutrinos (862 keV) are in band2. The CNO neutrinos contribute to both bands. If pp-III is stopped, the only change is the removal of B⁸ neutrinos, which don't affect these bands. Therefore, the flux ratio remains as it was. 

But what was the original ratio? If originally, band2 had Be⁷ and some CNO, and band1 had CNO, then the ratio was CNO_band1 / (Be⁷ + CNO_band2). If CNO is 5e8 and Be⁷ is 5e9, then even if all CNO were in band1, the ratio would be 5e8 /5e9=0.1. If CNO is split, it's less. Therefore, the maximum possible ratio is 0.1, and the minimum is lower. But the problem says "approximate", so 0.1 is reasonable. 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.1, so the ratio is 1/10. 

**Final Answer**
The approximate ratio of the flux between the two bands is \boxed{0.1}.

The pp-III branch in the Sun's proton-proton chain produces high-energy boron-8 (B⁸) neutrinos, which dominate the neutrino flux above ~5 MeV. However, the specific energy bands in question (700–800 keV and 800–900 keV) are primarily influenced by the beryllium-7 (Be⁷) electron-capture neutrinos (862 keV line, from the **pp-II branch**) and lower-energy components from the pp-I branch (≤420 keV). 

If the pp-III branch stops, the only immediate changes are:
1. **No impact on Be⁷ neutrinos**: The Be⁷ flux (862 keV) belongs to the 800–900 keV band (Band 2) and **remains unaffected**, since Be⁷ neutrinos arise solely from pp-II.
2. **No high-energy neutrinos from B⁸**: B⁸ neutrinos (peak ~10 MeV) do not contribute to these bands, so their absence doesn’t alter the ratio.
3. **pp-I neutrinos (≤420 keV) are unchanged** and also lie outside Band 1.

**Result**: The 800–900 keV band (Band 2) retains its Be⁷ neutrino flux (~862 keV), while Band 1 (700–800 keV) has no significant flux from the Sun (pp-I neutrinos <420 keV, no dominant source here). Thus, **Flux(Band 1)/Flux(Band 2) ≈ 0** (negligible fluxes in Band 1 compared to Band 2). 

However, if we assume the question implies atmospheric/other negligible backgrounds, the "exact" ratio would depend on instrument sensitivity, but the answer is effectively **≈0**. 

**Answer:** \boxed{0}

Let's see:

The pp chain starts with p + p → D + e⁺ + ν (pp neutrino). Then D + p → He³. Then He³ can either combine with another He³ (pp-I), He³ with He⁴ (pp-II and pp-III). If pp-III stops, He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ continues, but Be⁷ would capture an electron (pp-II) instead of capturing a proton (pp-III). So Be⁷ production continues, but instead of proceeding to B⁸, it becomes Li⁷ via electron capture. Therefore, Be⁷ neutrino flux (862 keV) would remain unaffected, as Be⁷ is still produced and undergoes electron capture. However, prior to stopping pp-III, some Be⁷ would have been converted to B⁸, but after stopping, all Be⁷ goes to Li⁷. Therefore, the Be⁷ neutrino flux would increase? Wait, no. Because if pp-III was active before, some Be⁷ would capture protons to form B⁸ (pp-III), but if pp-III stops, all Be⁷ undergoes electron capture (pp-II), so the Be⁷ neutrino flux would increase. But wait, the Be⁷ neutrino flux is from the electron capture. So if previously, some Be⁷ was consumed via pp-III (proton capture) to form B⁸, then stopping pp-III would mean more Be⁷ available for electron capture, increasing Be⁷ neutrino flux. However, the time scale here is 8.5 minutes. How quickly does the Be⁷ abundance adjust?

The Sun's core processes occur on timescales. The neutrino travel time is 8.5 minutes, so the change in nuclear reactions would take time to affect neutrino fluxes. However, neutrinos from the core take only seconds to escape, so if pp-III stops, B⁸ production stops immediately, and B⁸ has a half-life of about 0.77 seconds. So B⁸ neutrinos would cease almost immediately (within seconds). However, the Be⁷ neutrino flux would depend on the Be⁷ abundance. If pp-III stops, Be⁷ that would have been converted to B⁸ now remains and undergoes electron capture. But how quickly does the Be⁷ abundance build up?

The Be⁷ lifetime in the Sun's core is determined by the electron capture rate. The electron capture rate for Be⁷ is temperature-dependent. The Sun's core temperature is about 15 million K. The Be⁷ electron capture half-life under solar core conditions is about 53 days (from previous knowledge). Wait, but in the Sun's core, the electron density and temperature can affect the decay rate. Wait, Be⁷ normally has a half-life of about 53 days in the lab, but in the solar core, due to high electron density and ionization, the decay rate is higher. Let me check: Be⁷ electron capture in the Sun occurs much faster than in the lab. The solar core's electron density accelerates the decay. The actual lifetime in the Sun is about a few hundred seconds (minutes). Wait, I think the Be⁷ electron capture in the Sun's core occurs on a timescale of about 10^5 seconds (~1 day?), but I need to confirm. Alternatively, if the Be⁷ electron capture rate is faster, then the adjustment time would be shorter.

But given that the pp-III branch was stopped 8.5 minutes ago, which is 510 seconds. If the Be⁷ electron capture timescale is longer than 510 seconds, then the Be⁷ abundance hasn't had time to adjust, so the Be⁷ neutrino flux would remain similar. However, if the Be⁷ electron capture occurs faster, then the flux would increase. Alternatively, if pp-III was previously consuming Be⁷, stopping pp-III would allow Be⁷ to accumulate until electron capture removes it. But if the electron capture rate is slow, then Be⁷ would accumulate, leading to higher neutrino flux over time.

But given that the neutrino travel time is 8.5 minutes, the neutrinos we receive now were produced 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, no. If the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, neutrinos produced after that would take 8.5 minutes to reach Earth. So neutrinos emitted immediately after the stoppage would arrive now. However, nuclear processes in the Sun's core take time to adjust. For example, if pp-III stops, the B⁸ production stops, so B⁸ neutrinos would stop after the B⁸ decay time (half-life ~0.77 seconds). So B⁸ neutrinos would cease almost immediately (within seconds). However, Be⁷ neutrinos depend on the Be⁷ abundance. If Be⁷ is no longer being consumed by pp-III (proton capture), but instead accumulates until it undergoes electron capture (pp-II), then the Be⁷ neutrino flux would increase over time. But the timescale for Be⁷ accumulation depends on the rate of He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ and the rate of Be⁷ electron capture.

Assuming He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ occurs at a certain rate, and Be⁷ either captures a proton (pp-III) or an electron (pp-II). If pp-III stops, Be⁷ builds up until electron capture removes it. The time to reach a new equilibrium would depend on the Be⁷ electron capture rate. If the electron capture rate is fast compared to the production rate, then Be⁷ doesn't accumulate much. If it's slow, then Be⁷ accumulates.

But given that the change happened 8.5 minutes ago, which is a short time compared to solar nuclear timescales (which are typically millions of years), the Be⁷ abundance might not have changed significantly. Therefore, the Be⁷ neutrino flux would remain roughly the same. Wait, but if pp-III was previously consuming Be⁷, stopping pp-III would immediately stop that consumption. So Be⁷ would start to accumulate until electron capture removes it. But if the electron capture timescale is longer than 8.5 minutes, then the Be⁷ abundance hasn't had time to adjust, so the Be⁷ neutrino flux (from electron capture) would not have increased yet. Therefore, the Be⁷ neutrino flux would remain similar to before, but B⁸ neutrinos would have stopped.

But the question is about neutrino flux in bands 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Previously, B⁸ neutrinos (high energy) would not contribute to these bands. The Be⁷ neutrino line at ~862 keV is in band 2 (800-900 keV). Are there other neutrino sources in band 1 (700-800 keV)?

The CNO cycle produces neutrinos from N¹³ and O¹⁵ decays. N¹³ decay produces neutrinos up to 1.2 MeV (1200 keV), with an average around 0.7 MeV. O¹⁵ decay up to 1.73 MeV. So N¹³ neutrinos could have some flux in the 700-800 keV range. If pp-III stops, does that affect CNO neutrinos? The problem states that only pp-III stops; other reactions remain. So CNO cycle continues as before. Therefore, N¹³ and O¹⁵ neutrinos would still be produced. However, the CNO cycle's contribution to solar neutrinos is minor compared to the pp chain (about 1% in the Sun, but dominant in higher mass stars). So the main contributors to the neutrino flux in these bands would be Be⁷ (862 keV) and N¹³ (average ~0.7 MeV).

If pp-III stops, B⁸ neutrinos (high energy) stop, but Be⁷ neutrinos (862 keV) continue. The N¹³ neutrinos (average ~0.7 MeV) would contribute to band 1 (700-800 keV). Therefore, flux in band 1 (N¹³) and band 2 (Be⁷). The ratio would be flux(N¹³)/flux(Be⁷). But prior to stopping pp-III, there might have been some contribution from other sources. However, the problem states that only pp-III stops; other reactions (including CNO) remain. So N¹³ and O¹⁵ fluxes are unchanged.

But wait, pp-III stopping might affect the overall helium abundance? Probably not in 8.5 minutes. The Sun's composition changes over much longer timescales. So the CNO flux remains the same. Therefore, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) is dominated by N¹³ neutrinos, and band 2 (800-900 keV) by Be⁷ neutrinos. The ratio would then be flux(N¹³)/flux(Be⁷). However, if pp-III stops, does Be⁷ neutrino flux increase? Earlier reasoning suggested that if Be⁷ is no longer consumed by pp-III, but electron capture continues, but over 8.5 minutes, the Be⁷ abundance might not have changed much. Therefore, Be⁷ neutrino flux remains similar. So the ratio would be flux(N¹³)/flux(Be⁷). But what is the typical ratio between N¹³ and Be⁷ neutrino fluxes?

In the standard solar model, Be⁷ neutrino flux is higher than N¹³. For example, the Be⁷ neutrino flux is around 4.8×10^9 cm⁻² s⁻¹, while N¹³ is about 2.8×10^8 cm⁻² s⁻¹. So Be⁷ flux is about 17 times higher than N¹³. Therefore, if band 1 is N¹³ and band 2 is Be⁷, the ratio would be ~1/17 ≈ 0.06. But wait, the problem states that solar neutrino flavor changes don't play a role here, so we can ignore neutrino oscillations. Therefore, the fluxes are as produced in the Sun.

But wait, the N¹³ neutrinos have a continuous spectrum up to 1.2 MeV, with an average around 0.7 MeV. So in the 700-800 keV band, part of the N¹³ spectrum would contribute. Similarly, the Be⁷ neutrino line is at 862 keV. So band 1 (700-800 keV) would have some N¹³ neutrinos, and band 2 (800-900 keV) would have the Be⁷ line plus possibly some N¹³ and O¹⁵ neutrinos. However, O¹⁵ neutrinos go up to 1.73 MeV, so their contribution to band 2 would be minimal. Therefore, band 2 is dominated by Be⁷ neutrinos, while band 1 is dominated by N¹³.

But if pp-III stops, does the Be⁷ neutrino flux increase? If Be⁷ is no longer consumed by proton capture (pp-III), then more Be⁷ would undergo electron capture (pp-II), increasing the Be⁷ neutrino flux. However, the timescale for this increase is important. If the Be⁷ electron capture rate is faster than the production rate, then the Be⁷ abundance would stabilize quickly. But if the production rate is faster than the electron capture rate, Be⁷ would accumulate, leading to higher neutrino flux. However, given that the pp-III branch was stopped 8.5 minutes ago, which is a short time compared to nuclear timescales (which are usually much longer), the Be⁷ abundance might not have changed significantly. Therefore, the Be⁷ neutrino flux remains roughly the same as before, and the N¹³ flux remains unchanged. Hence, the ratio would be approximately flux(N¹³)/flux(Be⁷) ≈ 0.06 (as per standard solar model fluxes). But the answer options weren't given, so we need to compute the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects recognizing that pp-III produces B⁸ neutrinos (high energy), and stopping pp-III removes those. But the question is about lower energy bands. If the Be⁷ neutrino line is in band 2 (800-900 keV), and band 1 (700-800 keV) has no significant sources, then flux(band1)/flux(band2) would be near zero. But N¹³ contributes to band 1. Alternatively, if prior to stopping pp-III, band 2 had contributions from both Be⁷ and B⁸ neutrinos (but B⁸ neutrinos are higher energy), but stopping pp-III removes B⁸, but Be⁷ remains. However, B⁸ neutrinos are higher than 800-900 keV? Wait, B⁸ decay produces neutrinos up to ~15 MeV, but the spectrum peaks around 6-7 MeV. So the majority of B⁸ neutrinos are above 1 MeV. Therefore, in the 800-900 keV band (0.8-0.9 MeV), B⁸ neutrinos would contribute minimally, as their spectrum starts around 1 MeV. Therefore, band 2 (800-900 keV) is dominated by Be⁷ neutrinos (862 keV), and band 1 (700-800 keV) by N¹³ neutrinos. Hence, the ratio would be flux(N¹³)/flux(Be⁷). From standard solar model, Be⁷ flux is ~5e9, N¹³ ~3e8, so ratio ~0.06. But the problem says "approximate ratio". However, if pp-III stops, does the Be⁷ flux increase? If Be⁷ is no longer consumed by pp-III, then Be⁷ abundance increases, leading to more electron captures and higher Be⁷ neutrino flux. But over 8.5 minutes, would this have a significant effect?

Assuming Be⁷'s electron capture timescale is longer than 8.5 minutes, the Be⁷ neutrino flux wouldn't have increased yet. Therefore, the ratio remains flux(N¹³)/flux(Be⁷) ≈ 0.06. But if the Be⁷ electron capture timescale is shorter, then Be⁷ neutrino flux would increase. However, in reality, Be⁷ electron capture in the Sun occurs on a timescale of about 10^5 seconds (~1 day), so 8.5 minutes is negligible. Therefore, Be⁷ neutrino flux remains the same. Hence, the ratio is approximately 0.06, which is about 1/16.7. The closest approximate answer would be 0.06 or 1/17. However, the problem might expect recognizing that stopping pp-III removes B⁸ neutrinos, but those are higher energy. Since the question is about lower bands, the ratio is determined by other sources. Alternatively, perhaps there's another neutrino source in band 1.

Wait, pep neutrinos are at 1.44 MeV, which is higher than both bands. The pp neutrinos are up to 0.42 MeV, below both bands. So band 1 (700-800 keV) is between 0.7 and 0.8 MeV. The N¹³ decay produces neutrinos up to 1.2 MeV, with average around 0.7 MeV. So the flux in band 1 would be the integral of the N¹³ spectrum from 0.7 to 0.8 MeV. Similarly, Be⁷ is a line at 0.862 MeV. So band 2 includes the Be⁷ line. Therefore, flux(band1) is part of the N¹³ spectrum, flux(band2) is the Be⁷ line.

Assuming the N¹³ spectrum shape: the beta decay spectrum is continuous, with maximum energy 1.2 MeV. The average energy is about 0.7 MeV. The number of neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range would be a fraction of the total N¹³ flux. Similarly, the Be⁷ line is a monoenergetic flux at 0.862 MeV. So the flux in band 2 is the entire Be⁷ flux, while flux in band 1 is a fraction of N¹³ flux.

Assuming the N¹³ spectrum: the differential flux dN/dE for beta decay is proportional to (E_max - E)^2 * sqrt(E^2 + 2E m_e) * E^2, but integrating this might be complex. However, roughly, the number of neutrinos in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range can be approximated. The maximum energy is 1.2 MeV. The average energy is ~0.7 MeV. So the spectrum peaks below 0.7 MeV. Therefore, the flux between 0.7-0.8 MeV would be a small fraction of the total N¹³ flux. Let's say, for example, that 20% of N¹³ neutrinos are in 0.7-0.8 MeV. If total N¹³ flux is 3e8, then band 1 flux is ~6e7. Be⁷ flux is 5e9. Therefore, ratio is ~6e7 / 5e9 ≈ 0.012, or ~1/80. But this is a rough estimate.

Alternatively, using known neutrino fluxes and energy spectra:

From the standard solar model:

- pp: ~6e10 cm⁻² s⁻¹, up to 0.42 MeV
- pep: ~1.4e8 cm⁻² s⁻¹, 1.44 MeV
- Be⁷: ~4.8e9 cm⁻² s⁻¹, 0.862 MeV
- B⁸: ~5e6 cm⁻² s⁻¹, up to ~15 MeV
- N¹³: ~2.8e8 cm⁻² s⁻¹, up to 1.2 MeV
- O¹⁵: ~2.2e8 cm⁻² s⁻¹, up to 1.73 MeV
- F¹⁸: ~3e6 cm⁻² s⁻¹, up to ~1.7 MeV

Assuming N¹³ spectrum: the number of neutrinos in 0.7-0.8 MeV can be estimated. The total N¹³ flux is 2.8e8 cm⁻² s⁻¹. The average energy is ~0.7 MeV. The spectrum shape can be approximated by a beta decay spectrum. The number of events in a band can be found by integrating the spectrum over that range.

The beta decay spectrum for N¹³ (which decays into C¹³) has a Q-value of 2.22 MeV, but the maximum neutrino energy is Q - m_e c² ≈ 2.22 MeV - 0.511 MeV ≈ 1.71 MeV? Wait, no. Wait, beta decay Q-value is the total energy released. For N¹³ → C¹³ + e⁺ + ν_e. The maximum neutrino energy occurs when the positron has minimal energy. The Q-value is the mass difference between N¹³ and C¹³. Let me check: the decay N¹³ → C¹³ + e⁺ + ν_e has a Q-value of about 2.22 MeV. Therefore, the maximum neutrino energy is Q - m_e c² ≈ 2.22 - 1.022 ≈ 1.198 MeV (≈1.2 MeV). The neutrino energy spectrum ranges from 0 to 1.2 MeV. The average neutrino energy is roughly 1/3 of the maximum, so ~0.4 MeV. Wait, but beta decay average neutrino energy is typically around (Q - m_e)/3. If Q is 2.22 MeV, subtract m_e (0.511 MeV) gives 1.709 MeV. Then average neutrino energy would be ~0.57 MeV. However, this might vary. Alternatively, the average energy for N¹³ neutrinos is about 0.71 MeV. Let's check references: According to solar neutrino data, the N¹³ neutrino average energy is approximately 0.706 MeV. The spectrum peaks around 0.5 MeV. Therefore, the flux in the 0.7-0.8 MeV range would be a portion of the total N¹³ flux.

Assuming the spectrum shape, the fraction of N¹³ neutrinos in 0.7-0.8 MeV can be approximated. Let's model the spectrum using the allowed beta decay shape. The differential flux is proportional to (E_ν)^2 (Q - E_ν)^2, normalized appropriately. Integrating from 0.7 to 0.8 MeV:

Fraction ≈ ∫_{0.7}^{0.8} (E)^2 (1.2 - E)^2 dE / ∫_{0}^{1.2} (E)^2 (1.2 - E)^2 dE

This integral can be approximated numerically. Let's compute numerator and denominator.

First, compute denominator (total):

Q = 1.2 MeV

Den₀^₀^1.2 E² (1.2 - E)² dE

Let’s make substitution x = E / 1.2, so E = 1.2x, dE = 1.2 dx, limits from 0 to 1.

Denominator = (1.2)^5 ∫₀¹ x² (1 - x)² dx

The integral ∫x²(1 - x)² dx from 0 to1 is Beta(3,3) = Γ(3)Γ(3)/Γ(6) = (2!2!)/5! = 4/120 = 1/30 ≈ 0.0333

Thus, Denominator ≈ (1.2)^5 * 1/30 ≈ 2.48832 * 0.0333 ≈ 0.0829

Numerator: ∫_{0.7}^{0.8} E² (1.2 - E)^2 dE

Convert limits to x: lower x = 0.7/1.2 ≈ 0.5833, upper x = 0.8/1.2 ≈ 0.6667

Numerator = (1.2)^5 ∫_{0.5833}^{0.6667} x² (1 - x)^2 dx

Compute ∫x²(1 - x)^2 dx from a=0.5833 to b=0.6667

Expand the integrand: x²(1 - 2x + x²) = x² - 2x³ + x⁴

Integrate term by term:

∫x² dx = (x³)/3

∫2x³ dx = (2x⁴)/4 = x⁴/2

∫x⁴ dx = x⁵/5

Thus, integral from a to b:

[ (b³ - a³)/3 - (b⁴ - a⁴)/2 + (b⁵ - a⁵)/5 ]

Compute each term:

a ≈ 0.5833, b ≈ 0.6667

Compute b³: (0.6667)^3 ≈ 0.2963

a³: (0.5833)^3 ≈ 0.5833*0.5833=0.3403*0.5833≈0.1983

Term1: (0.2963 - 0.1983)/3 ≈ 0.098/3 ≈ 0.0327

Term2: (b⁴ - a⁴)/2

b⁴ ≈ (0.6667)^4 ≈ (0.6667²)^2 ≈ (0.4444)^2 ≈ 0.1975

a⁴ ≈ (0.5833)^4 ≈ (0.5833²)^2 ≈ (0.3403)^2 ≈ 0.1158

Term2: (0.1975 - 0.1158)/2 ≈ 0.0817/2 ≈ 0.0408

Term3: (b⁵ - a⁵)/5

b⁵ ≈ 0.6667^5 ≈ 0.6667 * 0.1975 ≈ 0.1317

a⁵ ≈ 0.5833^5 ≈ 0.5833 * 0.1158 ≈ 0.0675

Term3: (0.1317 - 0.0675)/5 ≈ 0.0642/5 ≈ 0.0128

Total integral ≈ Term1 - Term2 + Term3 ≈ 0.0327 - 0.0408 + 0.0128 ≈ 0.0047

Therefore, Numerator ≈ (1.2)^5 * 0.0047 ≈ 2.48832 * 0.0047 ≈ 0.0117

Fraction ≈ Numerator / Denominator ≈ 0.0117 / 0.0829 ≈ 0.141

So approximately 14.1% of N¹³ neutrinos are in the 0.7-0.8 MeV band. Therefore, flux in band1 ≈ 0.141 * 2.8e8 ≈ 3.95e7 cm⁻² s⁻¹

Flux in band2 (Be⁷) is 4.8e9 cm⁻² s⁻¹

Thus, ratio ≈ 3.95e7 / 4.8e9 ≈ 0.0082 ≈ 1/122

But this seems very low. However, considering that the N¹³ flux is already an order of magnitude lower than Be⁷, and only ~14% of N¹³ is in band1, the ratio becomes ~0.008. But this contradicts earlier rough estimates. Alternatively, perhaps the average energy is higher. If the average neutrino energy is ~0.7 MeV, the fraction in 0.7-0.8 MeV might be higher. Let's check another approach.

The N¹³ neutrino spectrum peaks around 0.5 MeV, but the average is ~0.7 MeV. The distribution is skewed. The cumulative distribution up to 0.8 MeV might be around 50%? If so, then flux in 0.7-0.8 MeV would be the difference between cumulative at 0.8 and 0.7. If cumulative at 0.7 MeV is, say, 40%, and at 0.8 MeV is 60%, then flux in band1 is 20% of total N¹³ flux. Then flux(band1) = 0.2*2.8e8 = 5.6e7. Ratio = 5.6e7 / 4.8e9 ≈ 0.0117 ≈ 1/85. Still low.

Alternatively, using the precise calculation earlier, ~14% of N¹³ flux in band1 gives ~0.008 ratio. However, standard solar model neutrino fluxes have Be⁷ at ~5e9 and N¹³ at ~3e8. So even if 10% of N¹³ is in band1, ratio is 3e7 /5e9=0.006. So approximately 0.01 or 1/100.

But the problem states that flavor changes don't matter, so we don't need to consider oscillations. Therefore, the approximate ratio is Flux(N¹³ in band1)/Flux(Be⁷ in band2) ≈ 0.01. However, the answer options weren't provided, but the user expects a boxed number. Given the possible calculations, the ratio is roughly 1/100 to 1/10. But considering that Be⁷ flux is ~5e9 and N¹³ in band1 is ~5e7, the ratio is ~0.01. However, in reality, the Be⁷ line is at 862 keV, which is within band2 (800-900 keV), so all Be⁷ neutrinos are in band2. The N¹³ contribution to band1 is a fraction of its total flux. If the fraction is ~14%, then 0.14*2.8e8 /4.8e9 ≈ 0.14*0.058 ≈ 0.008. So ~0.008, which is approximately 1/125. But this seems too precise. The problem asks for an approximate ratio. Given the options, perhaps the answer is approximately 0.01, so 1/100.

Alternatively, if the pp-III branch stopping leads to an increase in Be⁷ neutrino flux. If previously, some Be⁷ was consumed by pp-III, stopping pp-III would mean more Be⁷ available for electron capture, increasing Be⁷ flux. But over 8.5 minutes, given the Be⁷ electron capture timescale, which in the Sun is about a few hundred seconds (say, 500 seconds ~8 minutes), then the Be⁷ abundance would start to increase. If the timescale is comparable to 8.5 minutes, the Be⁷ flux could double. For example, if the lifetime is ~8 minutes, then after one lifetime, the abundance would be ~1/e of the original, but since we're adding Be⁷ that isn't being consumed, the flux might increase. However, this requires detailed solar model calculations.

But given the problem's hypothetical nature and approximate answer, perhaps the expected ratio is 1, assuming that stopping pp-III doesn't affect these bands. But that contradicts earlier analysis. Alternatively, if the Be⁷ and N¹³ fluxes are similar in these bands, but given standard fluxes, Be⁷ is much higher. Alternatively, maybe the question implies that pp-III produces neutrinos in band2, and stopping it reduces band2 flux. But pp-III produces B⁸ neutrinos which are higher energy, not in band2. Therefore, stopping pp-III doesn't affect band2, which is dominated by Be⁷. Therefore, the ratio remains Flux(N¹³)/Flux(Be⁷) ≈ 0.06. But earlier calculation suggested lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos (B⁸), which are not in the specified bands. The Be⁷ neutrinos (862 keV) are in band2. The only other source in these bands is N¹³ in band1. Therefore, the ratio is Flux(N¹³)/Flux(Be⁷). Given standard solar model values, this is ~2.8e8 /4.8e9 ≈ 0.058, approximately 1/17. So the answer is approximately 1/17 or 0.06. But the problem states that pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago. If Be⁷ flux increases due to pp-III stopping, then Flux(Be⁷) would be higher, lowering the ratio. But if the timescale is too short, the flux remains the same. Given the minimal time, the answer is approximately 0.06. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 1/17.

But I need to confirm. The key points:

- pp-III produces B⁸ neutrinos (high energy, >1 MeV), not contributing to the specified bands.

- Be⁷ neutrinos (862 keV) are in band2.

- N¹³ neutrinos (up to 1.2 MeV) contribute to band1.

- Flux ratio is N¹³ (band1) / Be⁷ (band2) ≈ 0.06.

But given that the problem states "approximate," and 0.06 is approximately 1/16.7, the answer is approximately 1/17 or 0.06.

However, another angle: if pp-III stops, the He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷ + γ reaction continues, but Be⁷ isn't consumed by proton capture (since pp-III stops), so all Be⁷ undergoes electron capture, increasing Be⁷ neutrino flux. But if previously, a fraction f of Be⁷ was used in pp-III, then stopping pp-III would increase Be⁷ flux by a factor of 1/(1 - f). What's the branching ratio between pp-II and pp-III?

In the Sun, the pp-II and pp-III branches occur based on the He³ abundance. The pp-I branch is He³ + He³ → He⁴ + 2p. The pp-II and pp-III branches are He³ + He⁴ → Be⁷. Then Be⁷ either captures an electron (pp-II) or a proton (pp-III). The branching ratio between pp-II and pp-III depends on temperature and density. In the Sun, approximately 15% of Be⁷ undergoes proton capture (pp-III), and 85% electron capture (pp-II). Therefore, stopping pp-III would increase Be⁷ neutrino flux by a factor of 1/0.85 ≈ 1.176. So Flux(Be⁷) becomes 4.8e9 /0.85 ≈ 5.65e9 cm⁻² s⁻¹.

But this adjustment occurs over the timescale of Be⁷ production and destruction. If pp-III stops, the Be⁷ abundance would increase until electron capture balances the production. The equilibrium timescale depends on the Be⁷ electron capture rate. If the original equilibrium had 15% of Be⁷ going to pp-III and 85% to pp-II, then stopping pp-III would require Be⁷ to accumulate until the electron capture rate equals the production rate. The production rate of Be⁷ is via He³ + He⁴. If originally, the production rate was P, and the destruction rate was P (since 15% + 85% = 100%), then stopping pp-III means destruction rate becomes 0.85P. To reach equilibrium, the new destruction rate must equal P. Therefore, Be⁷ abundance increases by a factor of 1/0.85, leading to a neutrino flux increase by the same factor. However, this assumes the production rate remains constant, which it would if He³ and He⁴ abundances are unchanged. But He³ abundance might adjust over time, but on short timescales (8.5 minutes), it's negligible. Therefore, Be⁷ neutrino flux increases by ~17.6%.

Thus, Flux(Be⁷) becomes ~5.65e9 cm⁻² s⁻¹, and Flux(N¹³) remains ~2.8e8. The flux in band1 (N¹³) is a fraction of 2.8e8. Assuming 14% as before, Flux(band1) ≈ 0.14*2.8e8 ≈ 3.9e7. Flux(band2) ≈5.65e9. Ratio ≈3.9e7 /5.65e9 ≈0.0069 ≈1/145. This is even smaller. But this contradicts the earlier factor increase.

Wait, if Be⁷ flux increases by 17.6%, then the ratio would decrease by the same factor. Original ratio was ~0.06, new ratio ~0.06 /1.176 ≈0.051. But this assumes that Flux(N¹³) remains the same. However, N¹³ production might depend on CNO cycle, which is unchanged. Therefore, Flux(N¹³) stays the same. Thus, the ratio becomes ~0.06 /1.176 ≈0.051, approximately 1/20.

But this requires that the Be⁷ flux increases by 17.6% within 8.5 minutes. However, the timescale for Be⁷ to adjust to the new equilibrium is important. The Be⁷ abundance adjustment time is the time it takes for the electron capture to process the increased Be⁷. The original equilibrium had:

Production rate P = destruction rate (0.85P_ec + 0.15P_p), where P_ec is electron capture rate and P_p is proton capture rate. When pp-III stops, destruction rate becomes P_ec'. To reach new equilibrium, P = P_ec', so P_ec' = P. Since originally P_ec =0.85P, now P_ec' = P. Therefore, Be⁷ abundance must increase by a factor of 1/0.85 to make P_ec = P. The adjustment time is the time it takes for Be⁷ to accumulate to the new level, which depends on the electron capture rate. If the electron capture timescale τ_ec = 1/(rate), and the original rate was 0.85P / N_Be⁷, then τ_ec = N_Be⁷ / (0.85P). When pp-III stops, the production rate remains P, and the destruction rate is N_Be⁷ * rate_ec. To reach equilibrium, N_Be⁷_new = P / rate_ec. Since rate_ec = 0.85P / N_Be⁷_old, then N_Be⁷_new = P / (0.85P / N_Be⁷_old) )= N_Be⁷_old /0.85. Therefore, the timescale to reach this is τ = τ_ec * ln(new/N_old) ? Or τ = τ_ec? If the system was in equilibrium, and suddenly the destruction rate decreases, the abundance will grow with time constant τ = 1/(rate_ec_new). Since rate_ec_new = rate_ec_old * (N_Be⁷_old / N_Be⁷_new). But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, if the electron capture timescale is τ_ec = 1/(rate_ec), and originally rate_ec =0.85P / N_Be⁷_old. After stopping pp-III, the rate_ec remains the same (since it's electron capture rate per nucleus), but the destruction rate is rate_ec * N_Be⁷. The net rate of change of N_Be⁷ is P - rate_ec * N_Be⁷. The solution to this differential equation is N_Be⁷(t) = N_Be⁷_old /0.85 * (1 - e^{-t/τ}), where τ =1/(rate_ec). If originally, N_Be⁷_old = P / (rate_ec + rate_p). With rate_p =0.15P / N_Be⁷_old. This is getting too involved without exact numbers.

Given the problem's time constraint (8.5 minutes), and assuming that the Be⁷ adjustment time is longer than this, the flux increase would be negligible. Therefore, Flux(Be⁷) remains ~4.8e9, Flux(band1) ~3.9e7, ratio ~0.008. But this is very low. Alternatively, if the adjustment time is short, Flux(
