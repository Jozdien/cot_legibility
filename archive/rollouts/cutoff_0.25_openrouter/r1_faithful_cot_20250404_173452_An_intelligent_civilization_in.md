# Original Question

An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their own perspective, we need to account for relativistic effects, specifically time dilation. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \(0.99999987c\), and the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is approximately 163,000 light-years.

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \(v = 0.99999987c\):
   \[
   \gamma \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}} \approx 1960
   \]

2. **Time experienced from Earth's frame**:
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{163,000 \text{ light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 163,000 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Proper time experienced by the astronaut (time dilation)**:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{163,000 \text{ years}}{1960} \approx 83 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the astronaut will take approximately \(\boxed{83}\) years to reach Earth from their own perspective.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so there's this problem about aliens traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at a really high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The question is asking how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective. The astronaut is 22 years old, and the aliens have an average lifespan of 150 years. I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the journey. 

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, time dilation comes into play. The proper time, which is the time measured by the astronaut, is shorter than the time measured by an observer on Earth or in the rest frame of the journey. The formula for proper time (τ) is the time experienced by the traveler, calculated using the Lorentz factor (γ). The formula is τ = t / γ, where t is the time measured in the rest frame. Alternatively, since the distance is also contracted from the traveler's perspective, maybe I should use the distance divided by speed, then apply the Lorentz factor. Wait, let me be precise.

The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth—Hmm, I need to know that. The problem doesn't specify, so I guess I should recall. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, right? Its distance from Earth is approximately... I think about 160,000 light-years. Wait, maybe, but let me verify. Let me recall: the Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years in diameter, and the Large Magellanic Cloud is a nearby dwarf galaxy, probably around 160,000 light-years away. Yeah, that seems right. Wait, but I might need to confirm this. For example, according to recent measurements, the distance to the LMC is approximately 49.97 kiloparsecs. Wait, one parsec is about 3.26 light-years, so 49.97 kiloparsecs is 49,970 parsecs times 3.26 light-years per parsec. Let's compute that: 49,970 * 3.26 = ?

Well, approximately 50,000 * 3.26 is 163,000 light-years. So 49,970 would be around 163,000 minus a bit. Let's be precise. 49,970 * 3.26 = (50,000 - 30) * 3.26 = 50,000*3.26 - 30*3.26 = 163,000 - 97.8 = 162,902.2 light-years. So approximately 162,900 light-years. Let me check an online source... no, I can't, but maybe as of recent data, it's about 160,000. Let me maybe just use 160,000 light-years as the approximate distance.

So if the distance is 160,000 light-years, according to Earth's frame of reference, and the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, then the time taken from Earth's perspective is distance/speed. So t = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987c. Since speed is in terms of c, the time in years would be approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.0208 years. Wait, because 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013, so 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 0.00000013. That's 160,000 + 0.0208. So approximately 160,000.0208 years. That seems almost the same as 160,000 years, but maybe there's a typo or the speed is so close to c that the time is almost the same as the distance in light-years. But wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

But considering that 0.99999987c is extremely close to the speed of light. Wait, 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So the Lorentz factor, γ, would be 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Let's compute that. 

v = 0.99999987c

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2. But since 0.99999987 is approximately 1 - 1.3e-7. So (1 - ε)^2 ≈ 1 - 2ε when ε is small. Therefore, v²/c² ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) = 1 - 2.6e-7. Therefore, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7. Then γ is 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute that.

sqrt(2.6e-7). The square root of 2.6 is about 1.612, and the square root of 1e-7 is 1e-3.5, so sqrt(1e-7) = 1e-3.5 ≈ 3.16e-4. Therefore, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.1e-4. Therefore, γ ≈ 1 / (5.1e-4) ≈ 1960.78. So approximately γ ≈ 1960.

So the Lorentz factor is around 1960. That means that time dilation is significant. So for the astronaut, the proper time τ is t / γ. From Earth's frame, the trip takes approximately 160,000 years, so the proper time is 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.63 years. But wait, does that make sense? The astronaut would experience about 81 years? But the problem says their average lifespan is 150 years. So a 22-year-old astronaut would be 22 + 81 = 103 years old upon arrival, well within their lifespan.

But wait, did I calculate this correctly? Let's check.

Another approach: from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. So the distance is L = L0 / γ, where L0 is the Earth's frame distance. Then, the time is L / v. So τ = L0 / (γ*v). Since v ≈ c, that's close to L0 / (γ*c). And since in Earth's frame, t = L0 / v ≈ L0 / c. So τ ≈ t / γ, which matches the previous approach.

Alternatively, using τ = t / γ.

Wait, 160,000 years / γ ≈ 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.63 years.

But maybe the distance isn't 160,000 light-years. Wait, if the problem states "Large Magellanic Cloud," perhaps the distance is different. Let me check again.

According to NASA and other sources, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years (as of 2013, using Cepheid variables measured by the Hubble Space Telescope). So, maybe let's take 163,000 light-years. Then, 163,000 / 1960 ≈ 163,000 / 2000 = 81.5, but 1960 is a bit less than 2000, so adding back, 163,000 / 1960. Let me do this division.

163,000 ÷ 1960. Let's see, 1960 × 80 = 156,800. Subtract that from 163,000: 163,000 - 156,800 = 6,200. Then 1960 × 3 = 5,880. So 80 + 3 = 83, and 6,200 - 5,880 = 320. 1960 × 0.16 ≈ 313.6. So, approximately 83.16 years. So about 83.16 years. So from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes roughly 83 years.

But the astronaut is 22 years old, so total age upon arrival would be 22 + 83 ≈ 105 years, which is under their lifespan of 150. So the answer is approximately 83 years, perhaps a bit more.

But let me check the speed again. The speed is 0.99999987c. Let me calculate gamma again more precisely. Because maybe my approximation was too rough.

Given v/c = 0.99999987, so beta = 0.99999987. Then gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Compute beta²:

beta² = (0.99999987)^2. Let's calculate this more accurately. Let me let beta = 1 - ε, where ε = 0.00000013.

Then beta² = (1 - ε)^2 = 1 - 2ε + ε². So 1 - beta² = 2ε - ε². Since ε is very small (1.3e-7), epsilon squared is negligible (1.69e-14), so we can approximate 1 - beta² ≈ 2ε = 2.6e-7. Therefore, gamma ≈ 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7).

Compute sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute this.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) × sqrt(1e-7) ≈ 1.612 × 3.1623e-4 ≈ 1.612 × 0.00031623 ≈ 0.0005107.

Therefore, gamma ≈ 1 / 0.0005107 ≈ 1958.39.

So gamma ≈ 1958. So that was an accurate computation.

Therefore, gamma is approximately 1958.

Therefore, τ = t / gamma.

If the Earth-based time t is 163,000 years (using 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987c ≈ t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000.021 years), which is practically 163,000 years.

Hence, τ ≈ 163,000 / 1958 ≈ ?

163,000 divided by 1958.

Let me compute this division.

1958 × 80 = 156,640.

163,000 - 156,640 = 6,360.

1958 × 3 = 5,874.

6,360 - 5,874 = 486.

1958 × 0.248 ≈ (since 486 / 1958 ≈ 0.248). So total is 83.248 years.

Therefore, approximately 83.25 years. So about 83.25 years from the astronaut's perspective.

Therefore, rounding, it would take approximately 83 years.

But to be thorough, maybe we can use the exact formula for the proper time. The astronaut's proper time τ is given by the integral of sqrt(1 - v²/c²) dt, but since velocity is constant, it's simply τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

Alternatively, since in the astronaut's frame, the distance is L = L0 / gamma, and τ = L / v = (L0 / gamma) / v = (L0 / v) / gamma = t_earth / gamma. So same thing.

But the question is now: is the distance exactly 163,000 ly? There's some uncertainty in that, but given the problem mentions the Large Magellanic Cloud, and doesn't give a distance, maybe they expect to use 160,000 ly as a rough approximation.

Alternatively, the problem might use a different figure, like 50 kpc (kiloparsecs) which is approximately 163,000 light years. Given that, 163,000 light-years would be the distance. So with gamma ~1958, gives τ≈ 163,000 / 1958 ≈ 83.2 years.

Alternatively, perhaps use 49.97 kpc (163,000 light-years). So whatever, in the ballpark of 80-83 years.

Alternatively, the problem might state "approximately" how long, so maybe even approximate gamma as 2000, so 160,000 / 2000 = 80 years.

But let's check once again in precise terms.

If you have v = 0.99999987c.

Compute gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2)

Calculate (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute it with more precision.

Let me set x = 0.99999987, then x = 1 - 1.3e-7.

x² = (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

The term (1.3e-7)^2 = 1.69e-14, which is negligible. So x² ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

Thus, 1 - x² ≈ 2.6e-7.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7).

Calculate sqrt(2.6e-7):

Let me compute sqrt(2.6) first. sqrt(2.56) = 1.6, sqrt(2.6) is a bit more. 1.6^2 = 2.56. 1.612^2 = approximately? Let's check: 1.61² = (1.6 + 0.01)^2 = 2.56 + 0.032 + 0.0001 = 2.5921. Which is more than 2.6. 1.612²: 1.61 squared is 2.5921, plus 0.002* (1.61 + 1.612) = wait, (1.61 + 0.002)^2 = 1.61^2 + 2*1.61*0.002 + 0.002^2 = 2.5921 + 0.00644 + 0.000004 = ~2.598544. Wait, 2.598544 is larger than 2.6? Wait, 1.612^2 is approx 2.6, so maybe around 1.612. So sqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.612.

Thus sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*sqrt(1e-7) = 1.612 * 1e-3.5. Well, sqrt(1e-7) = 1e-3.5 = 0.0003162. So 1.612*0.0003162≈ 0.000510.

Therefore, gamma ≈ 1 / 0.000510 ≈ 1960.78.

Therefore, τ = 163,000 / 1960.78 ≈ 83.1 years.

Therefore, approximating to the nearest year, approximately 83 years.

But perhaps the question wants a calculation where some rounding has already been done. Maybe the distance is taken as 160,000 light years, so that's 160,000 / 1958 ≈ 81.7, which is about 82 years. But given that NASA's figure is 163,000, 83 is accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended such that even with the high gamma, you use the time dilation formula like τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but in this case, t is the Earth time which is 163,000 years. So:

τ = 163,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) ≈ 163,000 * sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 163,000 * 0.000510 ≈ 163,000 * 0.000510 ≈ 83.13 years.

Yep, same result.

Alternatively, perhaps without relying on knowing the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Wait, could the problem be intending me to use Earth's frame time and then apply gamma, even if they don't give the distance? Wait, but the question mentions "how long will it take for their 22-year-old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach Earth." So definitely need to know the distance.

But maybe the user assumes that the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is known as about 160,000 light-years. Maybe in the problem composer's mind, perhaps.

So, given all this, the proper time experienced by the astronaut is approximately 83 years.

Hence, the astronaut, who is 22 years old, would age approximately 83 years during the trip. Therefore, it would take around 83 years from their perspective.

But since 83 seems precise, maybe there's another check. Let's consider that 0.99999987c.

The speed is 0.99999987 * c. Let's check how much time it takes for the light itself. If it's 163,000 light-years away, light takes 163,000 years. But the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c. The time from Earth's frame is 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000.0219 years. Rounded, still 163,000 years.

From the astronaut’s frame, the distance is contracted by gamma, so 163,000 / 1958 ≈ 83.2 light-years. Then, traveling at 0.99999987c, the time is (83.2 light-years) / 0.99999987c ≈ 83.2 years. So, the own astronaut's time is about 83 years. Correct.

Therefore, regardless of the method, we get around 83 years. Given that approximations in gamma and distance, but totaling about 83 years.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 83 years. So the astronaut would be 22 + 83 = 105 years old upon arrival, which is within the 150-year lifespan. So approximately 83 years is the duration from the astronaut's perspective.

**Final Answer**
The astronaut will take approximately \boxed{83} years to reach Earth from their own perspective.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so there's this problem about aliens traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at a really high speed, 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The question is asking how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective. The astronaut is 22 years old, and the aliens have an average lifespan of 150 years. I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the journey. 

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, time dilation comes into play. The proper time, which is the time measured by the astronaut, is shorter than the time measured by an observer on Earth or in the rest frame of the journey. The formula for proper time (τ) is the time experienced by the traveler, calculated using the Lorentz factor (γ). The formula is τ = t / γ, where t is the time measured in the rest frame. Alternatively, since the distance is also contracted from the traveler's perspective, maybe I should use the distance divided by speed, then apply the Lorentz factor. Wait, let me be precise.

The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth—Hmm, I need to know that. The problem doesn't specify, so I guess I should recall. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, right? Its distance from Earth is approximately... I think about 160,000 light-years. Wait, maybe, but let me verify. Let me recall: the Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years in diameter, and the Large Magellanic Cloud is a nearby dwarf galaxy, probably around 160,000 light-years away. Yeah, that seems right. Wait, but I might need to confirm this. For example, according to recent measurements, the distance to the LMC is approximately 49.97 kiloparsecs. Wait, one parsec is about 3.26 light-years, so 49.97 kiloparsecs is 49,970 parsecs times 3.26 light-years per parsec. Let's compute that: 49,970 * 3.26 = ?

Well, approximately 50,000 * 3.26 is 163,000 light-years. So 49,970 would be around 163,000 minus a bit. Let's be precise. 49,970 * 3.26 = (50,000 - 30) * 3.26 = 50,000*3.26 - 30*3.26 = 163,000 - 97.8 = 162,902.2 light-years. So approximately 162,900 light-years. Let me check an online source... no, I can't, but maybe as of recent data, it's about 160,000. Let me maybe just use 160,000 light-years as the approximate distance.

So if the distance is 160,000 light-years, according to Earth's frame of reference, and the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, then the time taken from Earth's perspective is distance/speed. So t = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987c. Since speed is in terms of c, the time in years would be approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.0208 years. Wait, because 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013, so 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 0.00000013. That's 160,000 + 0.0208. So approximately 160,000.0208 years. That seems almost the same as 160,000 years, but maybe there's a typo or the speed is so close to c that the time is almost the same as the distance in light-years. But wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

# Anthropic completion

Alright, I'm confronting this problem about aliens journeying from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The question asks for the journey duration from the astronaut's perspective. This astronaut is 22 years old, and the aliens typically live about 150 years. I need to determine the proper time the astronaut will experience during this voyage.

I recall that with relativistic speeds, time dilation is a factor. The proper time, which is what the astronaut measures, is less than what an Earth observer or someone in the rest frame would measure. The formula for proper time (τ) is τ = t / γ, where t is the time in the rest frame and γ is the Lorentz factor. Another approach could be to consider the distance contracted from the traveler's viewpoint, divide by speed, then apply the Lorentz factor. But I should be exact.

The distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth isn't specified in the problem. I believe the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. Its distance from Earth is roughly 160,000 light-years. To verify: the Milky Way has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years, and the Large Magellanic Cloud is a nearby dwarf galaxy, approximately 160,000 light-years away. Actually, recent measurements suggest the LMC is about 49.97 kiloparsecs away. Since 1 parsec equals about 3.26 light-years, 49.97 kiloparsecs would be 49,970 parsecs multiplied by 3.26 light-years per parsec.

Calculating roughly, 50,000 × 3.26 is 163,000 light-years. So 49,970 would be slightly less. For precision: 49,970 × 3.26 = (50,000 - 30) × 3.26 = 50,000 × 3.26 - 30 × 3.26 = 163,000 - 97.8 = 162,902.2 light-years. That's approximately 162,900 light-years. I can't check an online source right now, but recent data suggests it's about 160,000 light-years, so I'll use that as my approximation.

With a distance of 160,000 light-years from Earth's perspective, and the spacecraft moving at 0.99999987c, the time from Earth's viewpoint is distance/speed: t = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987c. Since the speed is relative to c, the time in years would be about 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.0208 years. This is because 1/0.99999987 is roughly 1.00000013, so 160,000 × 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 × 0.00000013, which equals 160,000 + 0.0208, or approximately 160,000.0208 years. This is almost identical to 160,000 years, but perhaps there's a typo or the speed is so near c that the time nearly equals the distance in light-years. However, I should probably calculate this more precisely.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, here's the paraphrased version of the text:

There's a problem about aliens traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at a very high speed, specifically 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The task is to determine how long this journey takes from the astronaut's perspective. The astronaut is 22 years old, and the aliens have an average lifespan of 150 years. The goal is to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the voyage.

I recall that at relativistic speeds, time dilation becomes relevant. The proper time, which the astronaut experiences, is less than the time measured by an observer on Earth or in the rest frame of the journey. The formula for proper time (τ) is the time felt by the traveler, which can be found using the Lorentz factor (γ). The formula is τ = t / γ, where t is the time from the rest frame perspective. Alternatively, since the distance is also contracted from the traveler's viewpoint, I could use distance divided by speed, then use the Lorentz factor. Let's make sure we get this right.

As for the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth, the problem doesn't provide it directly, so I should recollect. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and its distance from Earth is about 160,000 light-years, though I should confirm this. The Milky Way's diameter is about 100,000 light-years, and the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy, is roughly 160,000 light-years away—this sounds accurate, but confirmation is needed. In fact, recent measurements suggest the distance to the LMC is about 49.97 kiloparsecs. Since one parsec is approximately 3.26 light-years, 49.97 kiloparsecs equals 49,970 parsecs times 3.26 light-years per parsec. Let's calculate: 49,970 * 3.26.

Approximately, 50,000 * 3.26 is 163,000 light-years, so 49,970 would be slightly less. To be precise: 49,970 * 3.26 = (50,000 - 30) * 3.26 = 50,000*3.26 - 30*3.26 = 163,000 - 97.8 = 162,902.2 light-years, thus about 162,900 light-years. But without current access to online resources, let's use 160,000 light-years as a rough estimate.

Given an Earth-based perspective, if the distance is 160,000 light-years and the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c, the time taken by Earth's frame is distance/speed. So, t = 160,000 light-years / 0.99999987c. Expressed in years, this calculation is approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000.0208 years. Since 1/0.99999987 is about 1.00000013, then 160,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 0.00000013, which equals 160,000 + 0.0208. So around 160,000.0208 years. The time is almost the same as the distance in light-years, suggesting that the speed's closeness to c keeps the time nearly identical to the distance in light-years. However, it may be worth performing a precise calculation.

So 1 divided by that is 1 / (1 - 1.3e-7) ≈ 1 + 1.3e-7, using the approximation 1/(1-x) ≈ 1 + x for small x. Therefore, 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) = 160,000 + 160,000 * 1.3e-7 = 160,000 + 0.0208. So the time measured from Earth is approximately 160,000.0208 years. So roughly 160,000 years. But this is the Earth's frame time.\n\nBut the question is asking for the astronaut's proper time. So we have to calculate τ = t / γ. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). Given v = 0.99999987c, so sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). Let's compute (0.99999987)^2 first. Let me compute that. Alternatively, 0.99999987c is a speed with a Lorentz factor.\n\nWait, alternatively, note that for v≈c, γ ≈ 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c)) for v≈c. Wait, recalling that 1 - (v/c)^2 = (1 - v/c)(1 + v/c). If v is very close to c, then (1 + v/c) ≈ 2. So 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2*(1 - v/c). Therefore, gamma ≈ 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c)). Let me confirm.\n\nFor example, let v = c - ε, then 1 - v/c = ε/c, so 1 - (v/c)^2 = (1 - v/c)(1 + v/c) = (ε/c)*(2 - ε/c) ≈ 2ε/c when ε/c is very small.\n\nHence, sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) ≈ sqrt(2* (1 - v/c)).\n\nSo gamma ≈ 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c))).\n\nGiven that v = 0.99999987c, so 1 - v/c = 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013, which is 1.3e-7.\n\nTherefore, gamma ≈ 1 / sqrt(2 * 1.3e-7) ≈ 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1 / (5.099e-4) ≈ 1,960.78.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's see:\n\n2.6e-7 is 2.6*10^-7.\n\nsqrt(2.6) = approx 1.612, and sqrt(10^-7) is 10^-3.5, which is 3.162e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.099e-4 as above. Therefore, 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1960.78.\n\nSo gamma ≈ 1960.78. Therefore, time experienced by astronaut τ = t / gamma. We found t ≈ 160,000.0208 years, so τ ≈ 160,000.0208 / 1960.78 ≈ let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ approx 81.6 years.\n\nWait, 1960 * 80 = 156,800, and 1960.78 * 81 = 1960.78 * 80 + 1960.78 = 156,862.4 + 1960.78 ≈ 158,823.18, which is less than 160,000.\n\nSo 158,823.18 at 81 years.\n\n160,000 - 158,823.18 ≈ 1,176.82.\n\nSo 1,176.82 / 1960.78 ≈ 0.599 ≈ ~0.6 years.\n\nSo total time τ ≈ 81.6 years.\n\nWait, but wait, this is based on the Earth's frame time of ~160,000 years divided by gamma ~1960.78, which gives τ ≈ 81.6 years. But the astronaut is 22 years old, which is much shorter than their average lifespan of 150 years. So, in 81.6 years, the astronaut would age 81.6 years, plus their initial 22, totaling 103.6 years, still within the 150-year lifespan. So maybe the answer is approximately 82 years?\n\nBut I should check the gamma factor again. Maybe a more accurate calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute gamma directly.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).\n\nLet's compute 0.99999987 squared.\n\nLet me compute this precisely:\n\n(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169. So the square is approximately 0.9999997399999831.\n\nSo 1 - (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.9999997399999831 = 0.0000002600000169.\n\nWhich is approximately 2.600000169e-7. So let's approximate this as 2.6e-7 for simplicity.\n\nThus, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4 as before, gamma ≈ 1960.78. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps easier way to write in terms of 1 - v/c = 1.3e-7.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the approximation for gamma when v is extremely close to c.\n\ngamma ≈ (1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c))) )\n\nSo, 1.3e-7 is (1 - v/c), so 2*(1 - v/c) = 2.6e-7,\n\nsqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4, so 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1960.78.\n\nTherefore, this is consistent.\n\nTherefore, tau = 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ 81.6 years.\n\nBut I also considered that t was 160,000.0208 years, but that difference is negligible (0.0208 years is about a week). So overall, the ship's time is approximately 81.6 years. So as per the problem, how long will it take from the astronaut's perspective? Approximately 82 years?\n\nBut let me make sure that gamma is computed correctly, perhaps it's better to compute exact gamma:\n\n1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2):\n\nCalculate (0.99999987)^2 first. Let's compute:\n\nLet me write 0.99999987 as (1 - 0.00000013), then the square is:\n\n(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + 0.00000013^2\n\n= 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169\n\n≈ 0.99999974, actually?\n\nWait, if we compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.\n\nIt's easier to write in decimal form:\n\n0.99999987 is 9.9999987e-1. So squaring that:\n\n(10^-1 - 1.3e-8)^2\n\nHmm, expanding (a - b)^2:\n\na^2 - 2ab + b^2\n\n= (0.99999987)^2\n\n= (1 - 1.3e-7)^2.\n\nWait, my mistake: 0.99999987 is equal to 1 - 1.3e-7? Wait, 1 - 0.99999987 is 1.3e-7? Let's check:\n\n1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013, which is 1.3e-7. So yes.\n\nSo (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.\n\nThe square term is (1.69e-14). So overall, is 0.99999974, but with the small additions:\n\nBut 1 minus 2.6e-7 is 0.99999974, plus 1.69e-14. So yeah, 0.9999997400000169.\n\nTherefore, 1 - (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. But maybe we can take it as 2.6e-7. So sqrt(2.6e-7) as before ≈ 5.099e-4. So yes, same value. Therefore, 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) is indeed approximately 1960.78.\n\nWait, let's stick to the original number. If we do the exact sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2):\n\nsqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ exp(0.5 * ln(2.6e-7)).\n\nCompute ln(2.6e-7):\n\nln(2.6) + ln(1e-7) ≈ 0.955 + (-16.118) ≈ -15.163.\n\nHalved: -7.5815.\n\nThen exp(-7.5815) ≈ exp(-7.5) is about 0.000553, and exp(-7.5815) ≈ a bit less. Hmm, perhaps around 0.00051.\n\nWait, wait, care. Wait, exp(-7.5815):\n\nWe can compute as follows. 7.5815 is 7 + 0.5815.\n\nexp(-7) ≈ 0.000911882.\n\nexp(-0.5815) ≈ approx 0.558.\n\nSo 0.000911882 * 0.558 ≈ 0.000509. So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.0005095, so 1/0.0005095 ≈ 1963. Therefore, approx 1960.\n\nOkay, so previous approximation stands. So gamma ≈ 1960.\n\nGiven that, then tau = t / 1960 ≈ 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.6 years.\n\nAlternatively, is there another way to calculate proper time?\n\nAlternatively, for the astronaut, the distance is shortened by Lorentz contraction.\n\nSo the distance from Earth to LMC in the astronaut's frame is L = L0 / gamma, where L0 is the distance in Earth frame, which is 160,000 light-years.\n\nSo L = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.63 light-years.\n\nThen the time experienced by the astronaut is distance/speed = 81.63 / 0.99999987c. Since speed is 0.99999987c, which is, in light-years per year, approximately 0.99999987 ly/year. So time is 81.63 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.63 years. The 0.99999987 in the denominator only adds a negligible amount to 81.63 (about 81.63 * 1.00000013 = 81.63 + 81.63 * 0.00000013 ≈ 81.63 + 0.0000106 years), which is about 81.63 years. Therefore, indeed approximately 81.6 years. Which matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo either approach gives the same answer. So in terms of the astronaut's proper time, the journey takes approximately 81.6 years, which they would experience. Thus, since the astronaut is 22, they would be 22 + 81.6 = roughly 103.6 years old upon arrival, well within their 150-year lifespan.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 82 years.\n\nBut maybe we need to check whether the given 0.99999987c is indeed exactly as we considered.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a standard formula for time experienced by the traveler, known as the proper time. The formula is:\n\nτ = (L0 / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)\n\nBecause in the Earth’s frame, distance is L0 and time is t = L0/v. The traveler’s time is τ = t / γ. But γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (L0 / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Yes, which is the same as (L0 / γv) as velocity * time.\n\nBut for our case, v = 0.99999987c. Thus,\n\nsqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7). Which is approx 5.099e-4. Then,\n\nτ = (160,000 / (0.99999987c)) * 5.099e-4. Since 0.99999987c is ~1c, so approximate:\n\n(160,000 ly / c) * 5.099e-4. But as ly/c is 1 year, since light-year per speed of light is year. So (160,000 years) * 5.099e-4 ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 81.584 years. Hence, the 81.6 years as before. Therefore, spot on.\n\nSo the answer is approximately 82 years from the astronaut's perspective.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 82 years, so the boxed answer: \\boxed{82} years.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe astronaut will reach Earth in approximately \\boxed{82} years according to their own perspective.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743813727, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3448, prompt_tokens=940, total_tokens=4388, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine how long it will take for the 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) at a speed of 0.99999987*c*, we need to account for relativistic effects, specifically time dilation.

1. **Distance to Earth**: The LMC is approximately 160,000 light-years away from Earth.

2. **Time in Earth's Frame**: The time taken from Earth's perspective is calculated as:
   \[
   t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \text{ light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Lorentz Factor (γ)**: The Lorentz factor for a speed of 0.99999987*c* is calculated as:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \):
   \[
   1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}
   \]
   \[
   \gamma \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}} \approx 1960.78
   \]

4. **Proper Time (τ)**: The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000 \text{ years}}{1960.78} \approx 81.6 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: The astronaut, aged 22, will experience approximately 82 years during the journey. Therefore, the time taken from the astronaut's perspective is:

\[
\boxed{82}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

tw, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7. So 1 divided by that is 1 / (1 - 1.3e-7) ≈ 1 + 1.3e-7, using the approximation 1/(1-x) ≈ 1 + x for small x. Therefore, 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) = 160,000 + 160,000 * 1.3e-7 = 160,000 + 0.0208. So the time measured from Earth is approximately 160,000.0208 years. So roughly 160,000 years. But this is the Earth's frame time.

But the question is asking for the astronaut's proper time. So we have to calculate τ = t / γ. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). Given v = 0.99999987c, so sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). Let's compute (0.99999987)^2 first. Let me compute that. Alternatively, 0.99999987c is a speed with a Lorentz factor.

Wait, alternatively, note that for v≈c, γ ≈ 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c)) for v≈c. Wait, recalling that 1 - (v/c)^2 = (1 - v/c)(1 + v/c). If v is very close to c, then (1 + v/c) ≈ 2. So 1 - (v/c)^2 ≈ 2*(1 - v/c). Therefore, gamma ≈ 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c)). Let me confirm.

For example, let v = c - ε, then 1 - v/c = ε/c, so 1 - (v/c)^2 = (1 - v/c)(1 + v/c) = (ε/c)*(2 - ε/c) ≈ 2ε/c when ε/c is very small.

Hence, sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) ≈ sqrt(2* (1 - v/c)).

So gamma ≈ 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c))).

Given that v = 0.99999987c, so 1 - v/c = 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013, which is 1.3e-7.

Therefore, gamma ≈ 1 / sqrt(2 * 1.3e-7) ≈ 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1 / (5.099e-4) ≈ 1,960.78.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's see:

2.6e-7 is 2.6*10^-7.

sqrt(2.6) = approx 1.612, and sqrt(10^-7) is 10^-3.5, which is 3.162e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.099e-4 as above. Therefore, 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1960.78.

So gamma ≈ 1960.78. Therefore, time experienced by astronaut τ = t / gamma. We found t ≈ 160,000.0208 years, so τ ≈ 160,000.0208 / 1960.78 ≈ let's compute that.

First, 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ approx 81.6 years.

Wait, 1960 * 80 = 156,800, and 1960.78 * 81 = 1960.78 * 80 + 1960.78 = 156,862.4 + 1960.78 ≈ 158,823.18, which is less than 160,000.

So 158,823.18 at 81 years.

160,000 - 158,823.18 ≈ 1,176.82.

So 1,176.82 / 1960.78 ≈ 0.599 ≈ ~0.6 years.

So total time τ ≈ 81.6 years.

Wait, but wait, this is based on the Earth's frame time of ~160,000 years divided by gamma ~1960.78, which gives τ ≈ 81.6 years. But the astronaut is 22 years old, which is much shorter than their average lifespan of 150 years. So, in 81.6 years, the astronaut would age 81.6 years, plus their initial 22, totaling 103.6 years, still within the 150-year lifespan. So maybe the answer is approximately 82 years?

But I should check the gamma factor again. Maybe a more accurate calculation.

Alternatively, I can compute gamma directly.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).

Let's compute 0.99999987 squared.

Let me compute this precisely:

(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169. So the square is approximately 0.9999997399999831.

So 1 - (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.9999997399999831 = 0.0000002600000169.

Which is approximately 2.600000169e-7. So let's approximate this as 2.6e-7 for simplicity.

Thus, sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4 as before, gamma ≈ 1960.78. So same result.

Alternatively, perhaps easier way to write in terms of 1 - v/c = 1.3e-7.

Alternatively, let's use the approximation for gamma when v is extremely close to c.

gamma ≈ (1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c))) )

So, 1.3e-7 is (1 - v/c), so 2*(1 - v/c) = 2.6e-7,

sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4, so 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1960.78.

Therefore, this is consistent.

Therefore, tau = 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ 81.6 years.

But I also considered that t was 160,000.0208 years, but that difference is negligible (0.0208 years is about a week). So overall, the ship's time is approximately 81.6 years. So as per the problem, how long will it take from the astronaut's perspective? Approximately 82 years?

But let me make sure that gamma is computed correctly, perhaps it's better to compute exact gamma:

1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2):

Calculate (0.99999987)^2 first. Let's compute:

Let me write 0.99999987 as (1 - 0.00000013), then the square is:

(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + 0.00000013^2

= 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169

≈ 0.99999974, actually?

Wait, if we compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

It's easier to write in decimal form:

0.99999987 is 9.9999987e-1. So squaring that:

(10^-1 - 1.3e-8)^2

Hmm, expanding (a - b)^2:

a^2 - 2ab + b^2

= (0.99999987)^2

= (1 - 1.3e-7)^2.

Wait, my mistake: 0.99999987 is equal to 1 - 1.3e-7? Wait, 1 - 0.99999987 is 1.3e-7? Let's check:

1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013, which is 1.3e-7. So yes.

So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

The square term is (1.69e-14). So overall, is 0.99999974, but with the small additions:

But 1 minus 2.6e-7 is 0.99999974, plus 1.69e-14. So yeah, 0.9999997400000169.

Therefore, 1 - (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. But maybe we can take it as 2.6e-7. So sqrt(2.6e-7) as before ≈ 5.099e-4. So yes, same value. Therefore, 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) is indeed approximately 1960.78.

Wait, let's stick to the original number. If we do the exact sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2):

sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ exp(0.5 * ln(2.6e-7)).

Compute ln(2.6e-7):

ln(2.6) + ln(1e-7) ≈ 0.955 + (-16.118) ≈ -15.163.

Halved: -7.5815.

Then exp(-7.5815) ≈ exp(-7.5) is about 0.000553, and exp(-7.5815) ≈ a bit less. Hmm, perhaps around 0.00051.

Wait, wait, care. Wait, exp(-7.5815):

We can compute as follows. 7.5815 is 7 + 0.5815.

exp(-7) ≈ 0.000911882.

exp(-0.5815) ≈ approx 0.558.

So 0.000911882 * 0.558 ≈ 0.000509. So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.0005095, so 1/0.0005095 ≈ 1963. Therefore, approx 1960.

Okay, so previous approximation stands. So gamma ≈ 1960.

Given that, then tau = t / 1960 ≈ 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.6 years.

Alternatively, is there another way to calculate proper time?

Alternatively, for the astronaut, the distance is shortened by Lorentz contraction.

So the distance from Earth to LMC in the astronaut's frame is L = L0 / gamma, where L0 is the distance in Earth frame, which is 160,000 light-years.

So L = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.63 light-years.

Then the time experienced by the astronaut is distance/speed = 81.63 / 0.99999987c. Since speed is 0.99999987c, which is, in light-years per year, approximately 0.99999987 ly/year. So time is 81.63 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.63 years. The 0.99999987 in the denominator only adds a negligible amount to 81.63 (about 81.63 * 1.00000013 = 81.63 + 81.63 * 0.00000013 ≈ 81.63 + 0.0000106 years), which is about 81.63 years. Therefore, indeed approximately 81.6 years. Which matches the previous calculation.

So either approach gives the same answer. So in terms of the astronaut's proper time, the journey takes approximately 81.6 years, which they would experience. Thus, since the astronaut is 22, they would be 22 + 81.6 = roughly 103.6 years old upon arrival, well within their 150-year lifespan.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 82 years.

But maybe we need to check whether the given 0.99999987c is indeed exactly as we considered.

Wait, perhaps there's a standard formula for time experienced by the traveler, known as the proper time. The formula is:

τ = (L0 / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Because in the Earth’s frame, distance is L0 and time is t = L0/v. The traveler’s time is τ = t / γ. But γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (L0 / v) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Yes, which is the same as (L0 / γv) as velocity * time.

But for our case, v = 0.99999987c. Thus,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7). Which is approx 5.099e-4. Then,

τ = (160,000 / (0.99999987c)) * 5.099e-4. Since 0.99999987c is ~1c, so approximate:

(160,000 ly / c) * 5.099e-4. But as ly/c is 1 year, since light-year per speed of light is year. So (160,000 years) * 5.099e-4 ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 81.584 years. Hence, the 81.6 years as before. Therefore, spot on.

So the answer is approximately 82 years from the astronaut's perspective.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 82 years, so the boxed answer: \boxed{82} years.

**Final Answer**
The astronaut will reach Earth in approximately \boxed{82} years according to their own perspective.

The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Distance Calculation**: The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years away from Earth.\n2. **Time in Earth's Frame**: From Earth's perspective, the travel time is calculated as \\( t = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{160,000 \\text{ ly}}{0.99999987c} \\approx 160,000.0208 \\text{ years} \\).\n3. **Lorentz Factor (γ)**: The Lorentz factor is calculated using \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\).

This calculation shows that the astronaut, starting at 22 years old, would be approximately 104 years old upon arrival, which is within the average lifespan of 150 years for the civilization.", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=' Let me write it out numerically.\n\nCalculate 1 divided by 0.99999987. Let’s use binomial expansion. Let x = 1 – 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x + x² + x³ + … but since x is 1.3e-7, x squared is negligible. So it approximates to 1 + x. Hence, 1 / 0.99999987 ≈ 1 + 0.00000013 = 1.00000013. Therefore, t ≈ 160,000 x 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 x 0.00000013. Calculate the second term: 160,000 x 0.00000013 = 0.0208 years. So t ≈ 160,000.0208 Earth years. So yeah, barely more than 160,000 years. But since we’re dealing with time dilation, from the astronaut’s perspective, this would be less.\n\nNow, to compute the proper time. The formula is τ = t × sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / γ. So, calculate gamma (γ), which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given that v = 0.99999987c, then v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2. Let\'s compute that first.\n\n0.99999987 squared. Let’s compute:\n\n(1 - 0.00000013)² = 1 - 2(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)² ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169.\n\nSo approximately 0.99999974. Hence, β² ≈ 0.99999974, therefore 1 - β² ≈ 0.00000026. Then, sqrt(1 - β²) = sqrt(0.00000026). Let me compute that.\n\n0.00000026 is 2.6e-7. sqrt(2.6e-7). Since sqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.612, so sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) × 1e-3.5 ≈ 1.612 × 1e-3.5. But 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4? Wait:\n\nWait, no. Wait, sqrt(a × 10^b) = sqrt(a) × 10^(b/2). So sqrt(2.6 × 10^(-7)) = sqrt(2.6) × 10^(-7/2) ≈ 1.612 × 10^(-3.5). 10^-3.5 is 10^(-3) × 10^(-0.5) ≈ 0.001 × 0.3162 ≈ 0.0003162. So multiplying by 1.612: 1.612 × 0.0003162 ≈ 0.000510. Therefore, sqrt(1 - β²) ≈ 0.00051. Thus γ ≈ 1/0.00051 ≈ 1960.78.\n\nWait, wait! Let me verify:\n\nHold on, 1 - β² is (1 - 0.99999987^2) = 1 - (0.99999987^2). Correct. Then, 0.99999987^2:\n\nAs I thought before, (1 - x)^2 where x is 0.00000013, so approx 1 - 2x + x². So 0.99999974. So 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. Then, gamma would be 1 / sqrt(0.00000026). Let\'s compute that. sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7). As I said, 2.6e-7 = 26e-8, sqrt(26)=5.099, sqrt(26e-8)=5.099e-4. So sqrt(0.00000026)=5.099e-4. Therefore, gamma is approximately 1/5.099e-4 ≈ 1960. Let me compute 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.\n\nSo gamma ≈ 1960. Thus, the Lorentz factor is approximately 1960. Hence, proper time on the spacecraft τ = t / γ. Since from Earth\'s frame, the travel time is t ≈ 160,000.0208 years, then τ = 160,000.0208 / 1960 ≈ approx 81.63 years.\n\nWait, 160,000 / 1960 ≈ let\'s compute. 1960 × 80 = 156,800. 1960 × 81.6327 ≈ 156,800 + 1960 ×1.6327 ≈ 156800 + 3200 ≈ 160,000. So dividing 160k by 1960 gives ~81.6327 years. So approximately 81.63 years. Therefore, from the astronaut\'s perspective, the journey takes about 81.6 years. But let me be more precise.\n\nWait, let\'s check 1960 × 81.6327. 1960×80=156,800. Then 1960×1.6327=1.6327×2000=3265.4 minus 40×1.6327=65.308. So 3265.4 - 65.308 = 3200.092. So total 156,800 + 3,200.092≈160,000.092. So aim for 1960 × 81.63= approx 160,000. Therefore, 160,000 /1960 ≈81.63 years. So, on the travelers\'s clocks, they would measure approximately 81.63 years.\n\nBut check my numbers again. Because the Earth-based observer sees a time of ~160,000 years, and gamma is ~1960, so indeed τ = t /γ, so 160,000 /1960 ≈ 81.63 years.\n\nBut the given speed is 0.99999987c. Should I confirm gamma again.\n\nAlternatively, speed v = 0.99999987c. Then, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me recast beta = v/c =0.99999987, so beta squared = (0.99999987)^2.\n\nWait, calculate beta squared = 0.99999987 * 0.99999987. Let me do this precisely:\n\n(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 -2 * 0.00000013 + 0.00000013². Thus:\n\n1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169. So definitely, beta squared is approx 0.99999974. Then, 1 - beta squared is 0.00000026. Then gamma is 1/sqrt(0.00000026). Now, sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6 * 10^-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6)*10^-3.5, as sqrt(10^-7) =10^-3.5. sqrt(2.6)= approx 1.612.\n\nSo sqrt(0.00000026)≈1.612 *10^-3.5≈ calculate 10^-3.5. 10^-3 = 0.001, 10^-0.5=0.3162. So 0.001*0.3162=0.0003162. Then 1.612*0.0003162≈0.00051.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(0.00000026)=0.00051, so gamma=1/0.00051≈1960.784.\n\nSo yep, approximately 1960. So how exactly does that affect.\n\nYes, since gamma ≈1960 and t ≈160,000, hence τ=160000/1960≈81.63 years.\n\nBut wait. Is t = Earth time 160,000 light-years /0.99999987c. But the distance is 160,000 light years. At speed 0.99999987c. Then t=160000/0.99999987≈160000.0208 years. However, even if we use 160000.0208, divided by roughly 1960, gives almost the same value, 160000.0208 / 1960 ≈81.63 years. So same result.\n\nTherefore, astronaut’s proper time is approximately 81.63 years, which would approximate to 82 years.\n\nBut given that their average lifespan is 150 years, 22 +82=104, so the astronaut would survive the trip, ending up at about 104 years old upon arrival, which is within their average lifespan.\n\nBut perhaps need to check proper calcs step again.\n\nSo, according to relativity, proper time τ = t_earth / gamma. However, sometimes movement is considered from the traveler\'s frame, in which the length is contracted, leading differ calculation. Wait, both methods should match, right? Both methods because for different frames, but perhaps yield same result.\n\nWait, another approach: The astronaut sees the distance contracted by the Lorentz factor. So the distance in their frame is L = L0 / gamma. Where L0=160,000 light-years. Then the time in their frame would be L /v = (160,000 / gamma)/v.\n\nGiven that v=0.99999987c.\n\nHence, let\'s check what that quantity gives.\n\nLet\'s compute that. If Lorentz contraction is L = L0 / gamma, then τ= (L0 /(gamma * v)).\n\nBut since phi: v = 0.99999987c, L0=160000 ly, τ= (160000 ly / (gamma *0.99999987 c)).\n\nBut since ly / c = 1 year, so simplifies to τ=160000/(gamma*0.99999987)\n\nBut γ =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)≈1960 as before. Then, tau equals 160000/(1960*0.99999987). Compute that.\n\nFirst compute denominator:1960*0.99999987≈1960*(1−0.00000013)=1960−1960*0.00000013≈1960−0.0002548≈1959.9997452. Approximately 1960. So 160,000 /1960≈81.63 or 81.63 years. Same result. So τ≈81.63 years.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether you compute Earth time divided by gamma, or contract the distance and divide by speed, same result.\n\nOkay, so the approx time is 81.6 years.\n\nBut the problem statement says "approximately", so likely to expect either rounding to 82 years. But the answer may want written with one significant figure due to the inputs. Wait, problem gives speed as 0.99999987c, which is almost c. Let me check that again. 0.99999987c. So more details. Wait, 0.99999987c differs from c by only 0.00000013c. Which is 0.000013% slower than c. So characteristic gamma for such speed may be particular. Wait, perhaps the problem has a velocity very near to c, and hence a very large gamma, so that even over 160,000 light-years, proper time is manageable. But wait above calculation with beta=0.99999987 gives a gamma around 1960, leading to 81.63 years. But lets retry with exact calculation (even if the answer is okay).\n\nWait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).\n\nLet’s compute (v/c)=0.99999987.\n\n(v/c)^2= (0.99999987)^2. To compute this precisely.\n\nI think an exact calculation could be helpful. Let me compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2.\n\nExpanding:1 - 2 * 1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2. So then:\n\n(1 - 2.6e-7) +1.69e-14≈0.99999974. So yes, as before. Then beta squared is 0.99999974, hence 1 - beta squared is 0.00000026. Then gamma is 1/sqrt(0.00000026). Let\'s compute sqrt(0.00000026):\n\nPerhaps:\n\nsqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7). This is the same as sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Since sqrt(2.6)= approx 1.612, and as said before 1e-3.5=3.162e-4.\n\nSo sqrt(2.6e-7)=1.612*3.162e-4≈5.099e-4. Therefore, sqrt(2.6e-7)=approx 5.099e-4. Hence gamma is 1/5.099e-4≈1960. Hence, giving the same result.\n\nAlternatively, don’t approximate sqrt(2.6e-7). Compute precisely.\n\nIf we use the delta approximation. Let\'s denote x = beta, so that gamma=1/sqrt(1 – x^2). When x ~1, gamma ≈ 1/sqrt(2(1 - x)). Since, approximately, (1 - x^2) = (1 - x)(1 + x) ≈ 2(1 -x), when x→1. So, in this case, x=0.99999987, so 1 – x=0.00000013. So, using the approximation (1 – x^2)≈2(1 – x), thus sqrt(1 – x^2)≈sqrt(2(1 – x)). Therefore, gamma≈1/sqrt(2*(0.00000013)).\n\nCalculate that: gamma ≈1/sqrt(0.00000026). Exactly what we had before, sqrt(0.00000026)=sqrt(2.6 *10^-7)=sqrt(26) *1e-3.5 as per before. Therefore, gamma≈1/(sqrt(2*(1 – x))).\n\nWait, let me compute (1 – x)=0.00000013. Then, gamma≈1/(sqrt(2*0.00000013))=1/sqrt(0.00000026)= approx1960, same as before. So, that works.\n\nTherefore, all to say, my calculation appears correct.\n\nTherefore, astronaut\'s proper time: approx 81.6 years. Since the problem specifies \'approximately\', maybe as the answer is 82 years. However, check if the initial data uses the distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud taken as something different. Wait, for context, possibly, the problem assumes that Large Magellanic Cloud is 160,000 ly away. But is that accurate?\n\nAccording to current estimates, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is about 157,800 light-years away. Let me check. The updated measurement from ESA\'s Gaia mission (2018) suggests 162,200 ly (~49.70 kpc). NASA states 163,000 ly. So probably around 160,000 ly. But it’s unclear if the problem expects exact figure. If using 160,000 ly, then 81.63 years- gonna proceed with 82 years.\n\nAlternatively, somewhat ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, check if speed is exactly 0.99999987c, perhaps with gamma as (what?). If v=0.99999987c, 1 - v/c=1.3e-7.\n\nBut despite that, following all computations accurately. But maybe there\'s a formula for high-speed travel where gamma≈sqrt(c/(2d))???\n\nWait no. Wait, if v ≈c, then perhaps using an approximation τ ≈ d/(c*gamma), since gamma≈gamma because from Earth\'s perspective, time is t=d/v≈d/c, so τ= t / gamma ≈ d/(c*gamma). But maybe in these terms. But again, getting the same result as there.\n\nAlternatively, when speed is near c, there’s an approximation formula for tau: tau ≈ (2d)/(v*gamma)). Wait no, problem is one way trip. Therefore, perhaps formulas behaves differently. Don\'t stress. But the standard method is correct as applied:-earth time t=d/v; taum equals t divided gamma, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2}\n\nWait, did I misapprehend the direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if length contracts, then in the traveler\'s frame, the distance is L=L0*sqrt(1- v²/c²). Thus time is then L / v. So same result.\n\nLet me model it another way. When you are in the spacecraft\'s frame, the Earth and LMC are moving at 0.99999987c towards you(actually, you are moving toward Earth, while Earth moves at 0.99999987c towards you. So the distance between Earth and LMC is Lorentz-contracted.)\n\nHence, in that frame, the proper distance is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So L =160000 ly * sqrt(1 -0.99999987^2). Then, that sqrt gives the value ~0.00051, as we had initially. So L ≈160000 *0.00051≈81.6 ly. Then, starship\'s viewpoint would say Earth approaching at 0.99999987c, so time to collision is distance/speed =81.6 /0.99999987≈81.6 years. Hence, same answer.\n\nTherefore, that gives 81.6 years. Hence, perfect, both methods yield the same result. Then, 81.6 years is correct.\n\nBut since we are accounting for exact velocity t= tau=81.6 years. But let me check whether the constant acceleration or if it\'s a deceleration, but problem says constant speed.\n\nProblem states they are traveling at constant speed of 0.99999987c, so adjusting position.\n\nTherefore, alignment: the answer is approximately 82 years? If rounded.\n\nBut, given the approximate nature of the problem, maybe \\boxed{82} years.\n\nBut actually, with my calculations given 81.63, so maybe 82. Alternatively, maybe somewhere else. Alternatively, if you do exact calculation of (sqrt(1 - beta^2)/beta)* (distance/c).\n\nWait, let me code this precisely. Gamma for v=0.99999987c.\n\nCompute gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )\n\nCalculating step-by-step:\n\nFirst, 0.99999987c beta.\n\nBeta squared: 0.99999987^2. Let me compute this precisely:\n\nSince (1 - x)^2 = 1 – 2x + x^2. Here, x=1.3e-7 (0.00000013). Therefore:\n\nBeta squared: 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 =1 – 0.00000026 +1.69e-14. This is approximately 0.99999974.\n\nSo, 1 – beta squared=0.00000026.\n\nThen sqrt(1 – beta squared)=sqrt(0.00000026)=√(2.6*10^-7). The square root would be:\n\n√(2.6)*10^-3.5. √2.6=1.612, 10^-3.5≈3.162*10^-4. Therefore, sqrt(26)*1e-3.5=1.612 *3.162*10^-4≈0.0005099.\n\nThus gamma=1/0.0005099≈approximately 1960.784.\n\nThen:\n\ntau= distance/(gamma * beta c). But c is converted into ly/y. The distance is 160,000 ly. Time in spacecraft frame is the distance divided by speed. Because since distance contracts to 160,000/gamma ly, time=L/(v). L=160,000 ly / gamma.\n\nAlternatively.\n\nYeah, tau=(160,000 / gamma)/ v. Since v=beta c, and c=1 ly/year. So time=(160,000 / gamma)/ (beta).

Also note dividing by beta=0.99999987 makes a negligible difference here, since 81.6 /0.99999987≈81.6000106 years. Which is still 81.6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 81.6 years.\n\nFrom their perspective, the trip would take just over 81 and a half years, so approximately 82 years. But the problem says "approximate" and since they\'re 22 years old, it might mention within their lifespan.\n\nIf I need to give an approximate answer in a box, go with boxed 82.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The problem involves determining the proper time experienced by an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at a speed of 0.99999987c. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Distance Calculation**: The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years away from Earth.
2. **Time in Earth's Frame**: From Earth's perspective, the travel time is calculated as \( t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \text{ ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000.0208 \text{ years} \).
3. **Lorentz Factor (γ)**: The Lorentz factor is calculated using \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). For \( v = 0.99999987c \), we find \( \gamma \approx 1960 \).
4. **Proper Time Calculation**: The proper time \( \tau \) experienced by the astronaut is given by \( \tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} \). Substituting the values, we get \( \tau = \frac{160,000}{1960} \approx 81.63 \text{ years} \).

Thus, the approximate proper time experienced by the astronaut is:

\[
\boxed{82}
\] years. This calculation shows that the astronaut, starting at 22 years old, would be approximately 104 years old upon arrival, which is within the average lifespan of 150 years for the civilization.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 Let me write it out numerically.

Calculate 1 divided by 0.99999987. Let’s use binomial expansion. Let x = 1 – 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x + x² + x³ + … but since x is 1.3e-7, x squared is negligible. So it approximates to 1 + x. Hence, 1 / 0.99999987 ≈ 1 + 0.00000013 = 1.00000013. Therefore, t ≈ 160,000 x 1.00000013 ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 x 0.00000013. Calculate the second term: 160,000 x 0.00000013 = 0.0208 years. So t ≈ 160,000.0208 Earth years. So yeah, barely more than 160,000 years. But since we’re dealing with time dilation, from the astronaut’s perspective, this would be less.

Now, to compute the proper time. The formula is τ = t × sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / γ. So, calculate gamma (γ), which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Given that v = 0.99999987c, then v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute that first.

0.99999987 squared. Let’s compute:

(1 - 0.00000013)² = 1 - 2(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)² ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169.

So approximately 0.99999974. Hence, β² ≈ 0.99999974, therefore 1 - β² ≈ 0.00000026. Then, sqrt(1 - β²) = sqrt(0.00000026). Let me compute that.

0.00000026 is 2.6e-7. sqrt(2.6e-7). Since sqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.612, so sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) × 1e-3.5 ≈ 1.612 × 1e-3.5. But 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4? Wait:

Wait, no. Wait, sqrt(a × 10^b) = sqrt(a) × 10^(b/2). So sqrt(2.6 × 10^(-7)) = sqrt(2.6) × 10^(-7/2) ≈ 1.612 × 10^(-3.5). 10^-3.5 is 10^(-3) × 10^(-0.5) ≈ 0.001 × 0.3162 ≈ 0.0003162. So multiplying by 1.612: 1.612 × 0.0003162 ≈ 0.000510. Therefore, sqrt(1 - β²) ≈ 0.00051. Thus γ ≈ 1/0.00051 ≈ 1960.78.

Wait, wait! Let me verify:

Hold on, 1 - β² is (1 - 0.99999987^2) = 1 - (0.99999987^2). Correct. Then, 0.99999987^2:

As I thought before, (1 - x)^2 where x is 0.00000013, so approx 1 - 2x + x². So 0.99999974. So 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. Then, gamma would be 1 / sqrt(0.00000026). Let's compute that. sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7). As I said, 2.6e-7 = 26e-8, sqrt(26)=5.099, sqrt(26e-8)=5.099e-4. So sqrt(0.00000026)=5.099e-4. Therefore, gamma is approximately 1/5.099e-4 ≈ 1960. Let me compute 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.

So gamma ≈ 1960. Thus, the Lorentz factor is approximately 1960. Hence, proper time on the spacecraft τ = t / γ. Since from Earth's frame, the travel time is t ≈ 160,000.0208 years, then τ = 160,000.0208 / 1960 ≈ approx 81.63 years.

Wait, 160,000 / 1960 ≈ let's compute. 1960 × 80 = 156,800. 1960 × 81.6327 ≈ 156,800 + 1960 ×1.6327 ≈ 156800 + 3200 ≈ 160,000. So dividing 160k by 1960 gives ~81.6327 years. So approximately 81.63 years. Therefore, from the astronaut's perspective, the journey takes about 81.6 years. But let me be more precise.

Wait, let's check 1960 × 81.6327. 1960×80=156,800. Then 1960×1.6327=1.6327×2000=3265.4 minus 40×1.6327=65.308. So 3265.4 - 65.308 = 3200.092. So total 156,800 + 3,200.092≈160,000.092. So aim for 1960 × 81.63= approx 160,000. Therefore, 160,000 /1960 ≈81.63 years. So, on the travelers's clocks, they would measure approximately 81.63 years.

But check my numbers again. Because the Earth-based observer sees a time of ~160,000 years, and gamma is ~1960, so indeed τ = t /γ, so 160,000 /1960 ≈ 81.63 years.

But the given speed is 0.99999987c. Should I confirm gamma again.

Alternatively, speed v = 0.99999987c. Then, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me recast beta = v/c =0.99999987, so beta squared = (0.99999987)^2.

Wait, calculate beta squared = 0.99999987 * 0.99999987. Let me do this precisely:

(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 -2 * 0.00000013 + 0.00000013². Thus:

1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169. So definitely, beta squared is approx 0.99999974. Then, 1 - beta squared is 0.00000026. Then gamma is 1/sqrt(0.00000026). Now, sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6 * 10^-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6)*10^-3.5, as sqrt(10^-7) =10^-3.5. sqrt(2.6)= approx 1.612.

So sqrt(0.00000026)≈1.612 *10^-3.5≈ calculate 10^-3.5. 10^-3 = 0.001, 10^-0.5=0.3162. So 0.001*0.3162=0.0003162. Then 1.612*0.0003162≈0.00051.

Therefore, sqrt(0.00000026)=0.00051, so gamma=1/0.00051≈1960.784.

So yep, approximately 1960. So how exactly does that affect.

Yes, since gamma ≈1960 and t ≈160,000, hence τ=160000/1960≈81.63 years.

But wait. Is t = Earth time 160,000 light-years /0.99999987c. But the distance is 160,000 light years. At speed 0.99999987c. Then t=160000/0.99999987≈160000.0208 years. However, even if we use 160000.0208, divided by roughly 1960, gives almost the same value, 160000.0208 / 1960 ≈81.63 years. So same result.

Therefore, astronaut’s proper time is approximately 81.63 years, which would approximate to 82 years.

But given that their average lifespan is 150 years, 22 +82=104, so the astronaut would survive the trip, ending up at about 104 years old upon arrival, which is within their average lifespan.

But perhaps need to check proper calcs step again.

So, according to relativity, proper time τ = t_earth / gamma. However, sometimes movement is considered from the traveler's frame, in which the length is contracted, leading differ calculation. Wait, both methods should match, right? Both methods because for different frames, but perhaps yield same result.

Wait, another approach: The astronaut sees the distance contracted by the Lorentz factor. So the distance in their frame is L = L0 / gamma. Where L0=160,000 light-years. Then the time in their frame would be L /v = (160,000 / gamma)/v.

Given that v=0.99999987c.

Hence, let's check what that quantity gives.

Let's compute that. If Lorentz contraction is L = L0 / gamma, then τ= (L0 /(gamma * v)).

But since phi: v = 0.99999987c, L0=160000 ly, τ= (160000 ly / (gamma *0.99999987 c)).

But since ly / c = 1 year, so simplifies to τ=160000/(gamma*0.99999987)

But γ =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)≈1960 as before. Then, tau equals 160000/(1960*0.99999987). Compute that.

First compute denominator:1960*0.99999987≈1960*(1−0.00000013)=1960−1960*0.00000013≈1960−0.0002548≈1959.9997452. Approximately 1960. So 160,000 /1960≈81.63 or 81.63 years. Same result. So τ≈81.63 years.

Therefore, regardless of whether you compute Earth time divided by gamma, or contract the distance and divide by speed, same result.

Okay, so the approx time is 81.6 years.

But the problem statement says "approximately", so likely to expect either rounding to 82 years. But the answer may want written with one significant figure due to the inputs. Wait, problem gives speed as 0.99999987c, which is almost c. Let me check that again. 0.99999987c. So more details. Wait, 0.99999987c differs from c by only 0.00000013c. Which is 0.000013% slower than c. So characteristic gamma for such speed may be particular. Wait, perhaps the problem has a velocity very near to c, and hence a very large gamma, so that even over 160,000 light-years, proper time is manageable. But wait above calculation with beta=0.99999987 gives a gamma around 1960, leading to 81.63 years. But lets retry with exact calculation (even if the answer is okay).

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2).

Let’s compute (v/c)=0.99999987.

(v/c)^2= (0.99999987)^2. To compute this precisely.

I think an exact calculation could be helpful. Let me compute (1 - 1.3e-7)^2.

Expanding:1 - 2 * 1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2. So then:

(1 - 2.6e-7) +1.69e-14≈0.99999974. So yes, as before. Then beta squared is 0.99999974, hence 1 - beta squared is 0.00000026. Then gamma is 1/sqrt(0.00000026). Let's compute sqrt(0.00000026):

Perhaps:

sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7). This is the same as sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Since sqrt(2.6)= approx 1.612, and as said before 1e-3.5=3.162e-4.

So sqrt(2.6e-7)=1.612*3.162e-4≈5.099e-4. Therefore, sqrt(2.6e-7)=approx 5.099e-4. Hence gamma is 1/5.099e-4≈1960. Hence, giving the same result.

Alternatively, don’t approximate sqrt(2.6e-7). Compute precisely.

If we use the delta approximation. Let's denote x = beta, so that gamma=1/sqrt(1 – x^2). When x ~1, gamma ≈ 1/sqrt(2(1 - x)). Since, approximately, (1 - x^2) = (1 - x)(1 + x) ≈ 2(1 -x), when x→1. So, in this case, x=0.99999987, so 1 – x=0.00000013. So, using the approximation (1 – x^2)≈2(1 – x), thus sqrt(1 – x^2)≈sqrt(2(1 – x)). Therefore, gamma≈1/sqrt(2*(0.00000013)).

Calculate that: gamma ≈1/sqrt(0.00000026). Exactly what we had before, sqrt(0.00000026)=sqrt(2.6 *10^-7)=sqrt(26) *1e-3.5 as per before. Therefore, gamma≈1/(sqrt(2*(1 – x))).

Wait, let me compute (1 – x)=0.00000013. Then, gamma≈1/(sqrt(2*0.00000013))=1/sqrt(0.00000026)= approx1960, same as before. So, that works.

Therefore, all to say, my calculation appears correct.

Therefore, astronaut's proper time: approx 81.6 years. Since the problem specifies 'approximately', maybe as the answer is 82 years. However, check if the initial data uses the distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud taken as something different. Wait, for context, possibly, the problem assumes that Large Magellanic Cloud is 160,000 ly away. But is that accurate?

According to current estimates, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is about 157,800 light-years away. Let me check. The updated measurement from ESA's Gaia mission (2018) suggests 162,200 ly (~49.70 kpc). NASA states 163,000 ly. So probably around 160,000 ly. But it’s unclear if the problem expects exact figure. If using 160,000 ly, then 81.63 years- gonna proceed with 82 years.

Alternatively, somewhat ambiguous.

Alternatively, check if speed is exactly 0.99999987c, perhaps with gamma as (what?). If v=0.99999987c, 1 - v/c=1.3e-7.

But despite that, following all computations accurately. But maybe there's a formula for high-speed travel where gamma≈sqrt(c/(2d))???

Wait no. Wait, if v ≈c, then perhaps using an approximation τ ≈ d/(c*gamma), since gamma≈gamma because from Earth's perspective, time is t=d/v≈d/c, so τ= t / gamma ≈ d/(c*gamma). But maybe in these terms. But again, getting the same result as there.

Alternatively, when speed is near c, there’s an approximation formula for tau: tau ≈ (2d)/(v*gamma)). Wait no, problem is one way trip. Therefore, perhaps formulas behaves differently. Don't stress. But the standard method is correct as applied:-earth time t=d/v; taum equals t divided gamma, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2}

Wait, did I misapprehend the direction.

Alternatively, maybe if length contracts, then in the traveler's frame, the distance is L=L0*sqrt(1- v²/c²). Thus time is then L / v. So same result.

Let me model it another way. When you are in the spacecraft's frame, the Earth and LMC are moving at 0.99999987c towards you(actually, you are moving toward Earth, while Earth moves at 0.99999987c towards you. So the distance between Earth and LMC is Lorentz-contracted.)

Hence, in that frame, the proper distance is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So L =160000 ly * sqrt(1 -0.99999987^2). Then, that sqrt gives the value ~0.00051, as we had initially. So L ≈160000 *0.00051≈81.6 ly. Then, starship's viewpoint would say Earth approaching at 0.99999987c, so time to collision is distance/speed =81.6 /0.99999987≈81.6 years. Hence, same answer.

Therefore, that gives 81.6 years. Hence, perfect, both methods yield the same result. Then, 81.6 years is correct.

But since we are accounting for exact velocity t= tau=81.6 years. But let me check whether the constant acceleration or if it's a deceleration, but problem says constant speed.

Problem states they are traveling at constant speed of 0.99999987c, so adjusting position.

Therefore, alignment: the answer is approximately 82 years? If rounded.

But, given the approximate nature of the problem, maybe \boxed{82} years.

But actually, with my calculations given 81.63, so maybe 82. Alternatively, maybe somewhere else. Alternatively, if you do exact calculation of (sqrt(1 - beta^2)/beta)* (distance/c).

Wait, let me code this precisely. Gamma for v=0.99999987c.

Compute gamma=1/sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )

Calculating step-by-step:

First, 0.99999987c beta.

Beta squared: 0.99999987^2. Let me compute this precisely:

Since (1 - x)^2 = 1 – 2x + x^2. Here, x=1.3e-7 (0.00000013). Therefore:

Beta squared: 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 =1 – 0.00000026 +1.69e-14. This is approximately 0.99999974.

So, 1 – beta squared=0.00000026.

Then sqrt(1 – beta squared)=sqrt(0.00000026)=√(2.6*10^-7). The square root would be:

√(2.6)*10^-3.5. √2.6=1.612, 10^-3.5≈3.162*10^-4. Therefore, sqrt(26)*1e-3.5=1.612 *3.162*10^-4≈0.0005099.

Thus gamma=1/0.0005099≈approximately 1960.784.

Then:

tau= distance/(gamma * beta c). But c is converted into ly/y. The distance is 160,000 ly. Time in spacecraft frame is the distance divided by speed. Because since distance contracts to 160,000/gamma ly, time=L/(v). L=160,000 ly / gamma.

Alternatively.

Yeah, tau=(160,000 / gamma)/ v. Since v=beta c, and c=1 ly/year. So time=(160,000 / gamma)/ (beta). Since beta=0.99999987, time ≈ (160,000 /1960.784)/0.99999987.

Calculation:

160000 divided by 1960.784:approx.

1960.784*80=156,862.72. 160,000 – 156,862.72≈3,137.28. 3,137.28 /1960.784 ≈approx1.6 years.

Hence total approximates 80 +1.6=81.6.

Therefore, tau≈81.6 years. Also note dividing by beta=0.99999987 makes a negligible difference here, since 81.6 /0.99999987≈81.6000106 years. Which is still 81.6.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 81.6 years.

From their perspective, the trip would take just over 81 and a half years, so approximately 82 years. But the problem says "approximate" and since they're 22 years old, it might mention within their lifespan.

If I need to give an approximate answer in a box, go with boxed 82. However, given the average lifespan of 150, 22 +82=104—so they live to 104. It's under 150, so possible.

Wait, but an exclamation. When moving at gamma approx 1960, how in young around such dilation. But in one’s own frame, they just experience their own proper time.

Alternatively, miscalculation: wait, my calculation again:

Earth frame: Time taken t=160000 ly /0.99999987c. 160000 ly /1 ly per year=160000 years divided by approx ~1. Hence t=160000 years divided by ~1≈160000 years. Therefore, tau= 160000 /1960≈81.63 years.

Therefore, approximately 82 years. So, correct. The astronaut ages 82 years. And yes, within their lifespan.

Maybe the problem looking for knowledge of high gamma factor leading to significant time dilation.

Alternative, question might hold a bug in weapon. However, given me being me, not ignoring any details and check calculations again, alternate proofs shows same result.

Thus, the answer is about 82 years. Hence, \boxed{82} years.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{82}

Therefore, probably, from Earth’s frame, the time would be just 160,000/(0.99999987) years. Which as you said, is approximately 160,000*(1 + 1.3e-7) which is like 160,000 + 0.0208, as any small number. Indeed, so approximately 160,000.02 years. So, very close to 160,000 years from Earth\'s perspective.\n\nBut then, proper time is the traveler\'s time. So, τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since your lifetime concerns the astronaut\'s frame. Let\'s compute γ first. The velocity is 0.99999987c. Let\'s compute v²/c²: equal to (0.99999987)^2. Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2.\n\nBut (0.99999987)^2 is 1 - (2.6*10^{-7} + negligible terms). Let\'s verify.\n\nIf you have (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small.\n\nBut our velocity is actually 0.99999987, which is 1 - 1.3e-7. Wait: Since 1 - 0.99999987 is 0.00000013, so x = 1.3e-7. So 1 - x.\n\nTherefore, the Lorentz factor is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ≈ 1/sqrt(2x - x²) ≈ 1/sqrt(2x) because x is really small (x is 1.3e-7).\n\nBut we need to compute 1 - v^2/c^2. With v = (1 - δ)c where δ =1.3e-7. So, v = c(1 - δ).\n\nThen, v²/c² = (1 - δ)^2 = 1 - 2δ + δ² ≈ 1 - 2δ, since δ² is negligible.\n\nHence, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2δ = 2 * 1.3e-7 = 2.6e-7.\n\nThus, the gamma factor, γ, is 1/sqrt(2δ) = 1/sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that. sq rt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, what\'s the square root of 2.6e-7?\n\nsqrt(ab) = sqrt(a) * sqrt(b), so sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 = 1e-3*sqrt(10) kind of.\n\nAlternatively, 2.6e-7 can be written as 26e-8, so sqrt(26e-8) = sqrt(26)*sqrt(1e-8) = 5.099*1e-4 = approximately 5.099e-4. Then, 1/gamma is sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4. Hence gamma ≈ 1/(5.099e-4) ≈ 1960 (since 1/5.099e-4 ≈ 1/0.0005099 ≈ 1960). Let me verify with precise calculation:\n\nsqrt(2.6e-7): 2.6e-7 = 0.00000026\n\nTake sqrt of 0.00000026: sqrt(26)*1e-4: sqrt(25) = 5, sqrt(26)=5.099 as above, so approximately 0.0005099. Then, the gamma factor is 1/0.0005099 = approx 1960.8. So gamma ≈ 1960.8. Therefore, Lorentz factor is roughly 1960.8.\n\nThus, the trip duration from Earth\'s perspective is 160,000.0208 years, as earlier, but from the astronaut\'s perspective, the proper time τ is Earth\'s time divided by gamma, so 160,000.0208 / 1960.8 ≈ approximately 81.6 years.\n\nWait, let\'s calculate that.\n\n160,000.0208 years divided by 1960.8 is approximately: 160,000 / 1960.8 ≈ Since 1960.8 *80= 156,864. 1960.8*81=156,864 + 1960.8=158,824.8. 1960.8*82=158,824.8 + 1960.8=160,785.6. So 160,000 years is between 81 and 82 years. Specifically, 160,000 -158,824.8=1,175.2 at 1960.8 per year. Therefore, 1,175.2 /1960.8 ≈ 0.598 years (about 7 months). So total is 81.598 years, approximately 81.6 years. So the astronaut would experience around 81.6 years.\n\nBut of course, considering that the actual time from Earth\'s frame is a smidge over 160,000 years, taking that factor in:\n\nLet\'s compute more accurately:\n\nEarth time, t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 × 1.0000001300…≈ 160,000 + (160,000 × 1.3e-7). 160,000×1.3e-7 = 0.0208. So, approximately t ≈ 160,000.0208 years.\n\nThen, gamma is calculated as 1960.8. Therefore, tau ( proper time) = t / gamma ≈ 160,000.0208 / 1960.8 ≈ 81.6 years.\n\nTherefore, the astronaut would age about 81.6 years during the journey.\n\nWait, the problem mentions the average lifetime of these aliens is approximately 150 years. Their astronaut is 22 years old. So 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years old upon arrival. So within their lifespan.\n\nBut the answer to the question is "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach Earth?" So it\'s just the proper time, around 81.6 years, so approximately 82 years.\n\nBut wait, let\'s be even more precise.\n\nTo compute Gamma:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).\n\nGiven v=0.99999987 c.\n\nTherefore,\n\nv = 0.99999987c\n\nv^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2.\n\nExpand that:\n\n(1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14\n\nThus,\n\n1 - v^2/c^2 ≈ 2.6e-7 - (1.69e-14), which is about 2.6e-7 (since 1.69e-14 is negligible)\n\nThen, gamma = 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). Let\'s compute sqrt(2.6e-7).\n\nsqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.61245.\n\nsqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.61245 * (1e-3.5). However, sqrt(1e-7) is exp( (1/2) * ln(1e-7) ) = (1e-7)^(1/2) =1e-3.5. Then 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 *1e-0.5 ≈ 0.001 * 0.3162 ≈ 0.0003162.\n\nThus sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈1.61245 *0.0003162≈ 0.0005100.\n\nSo gamma =1 /0.0005100 ≈1960.78.\n\nThus, to more decimal points, gamma ≈ 1960.78.\n\nThus, tau =160,000 /0.99999987 /1960.78 ≈160,000.0208/1960.78≈81.598 years… ≈81.6 years.\n\nSo approx. 81.6 years. Therefore, answer is approximately 82 years.\n\nBut we need to consider another possible approach - the astronaut\'s own measurement. Wait, perhaps an alternative method. Since, in the astronaut\'s frame, the distance is length contracted, so L = L0 / gamma. Hence, Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud are moving towards them at velocity v, and the distance is contracted.\n\nSo, L = 160,000 ly / gamma.\n\nTherefore, time = distance/speed.\n\nSo τ = L /v = (160,000 ly / gamma) /0.99999987 c.\n\nBut since 1 ly/year = c. Therefore, ly / (c) is years. So that simplifies.\n\nThus,\n\nτ = (160,000 /gamma)/0.99999987 which is 160,000 / (gamma*0.99999987).\n\nBut gamma is 1960.78, so:\n\n1960.78*0.99999987 ≈1960.78*(1 - 1.3e-7)≈1960.78 - 0.000254 ≈1960.7797 approximately.\n\nTherefore, τ≈160,000 /1960.7797≈81.598≈ the same 81.6 years.\n\nSo, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, we might use more precise computation if we retain more digits. However, with the numbers provided, 0.99999987c is an incredibly high gamma factor. Thus, γ is ≈1960, Earth time is ≈160,000 years, and properτ≈160,000 / 1960≈81.6 years.Therefore, the proper time is approximately 82 years.\n\nBut check if all quantities are correctly substituted.\n\nAnother point of attention: the problem states "the Large Magellanic Cloud" to Earth. If there’s uncertainty about the distance, perhaps taking more recent data, but perhaps for purposes here, assuming 160k ly is okay. If the actual distance is different, answer may change, but since the problem doesn\'t specify, proceed with that. The NASA website says that the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. So that would lead to 163,000 divided by same gamma. But using 160,000 vs 163,000 will result in a two percent difference.\n\nBut as problem says "approximate", therefore 160,000 leads to 81.6, but if 163k /1960 would be around 163000/1960≈83.16 years. So, depending on real distance. But if not given specific distance, we go with our initial data.\n\nAlternatively, what if a better approximation exact is indeed needing 160k ly. So, if influenced precise gamma...\n\nWait, wait a moment. The initial thing is 0.99999987c. How exactly gamma is here. Compute gamma again. Compute Beta as v/c = .99999987.\n\nBeta squared = (0.99999987)^2:\n\nFirst, write as (1 - 0.00000013). Then compute (1 - δ)^2 where δ = 1.3e-7:\n\n(1 - δ)^2 = 1 - 2δ + δ².\n\nSo≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.\n\nThus, gamma becomes 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). As above, so 2.6e-7 square root taking. However, maybe 2.6e-7 = 26e-8, sqrt(26) is around 5.099, sqrt(1e-8)=1e-4, so 5.099e-4. Gamma =1/(5.099e-4)≈1960.\n\nMoreover, even precise calculation for sqrt(26)*1e-4≈5.099e-4. Thus gamma≈1960.\n\nAlternatively, using exact values: let\'s compute 1 / sqrt(1 - Beta^2):\n\nBeta =0.99999987.\n\nBeta^2=0.99999974... but perhaps over precision?\n\nWait, alternative calculator approach.\n\nCompute 0.99999987 squared:\n\n(0.99999987)*(0.99999987)=.\n\nLet me compute (1 - x)^2=1 - 2x + x² where x=0.00000013.\n\nSo 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2=0.99999974 + 1.69e-14≈0.999999740000000169≈~0.99999974.\n\nTherefore, 1 minus Beta squared is approx 0.0000002599999998, which is ~2.6e-7, which is the same as before. Therefore, SQRT(2.6e-7)≈~0.0005099, yep. Gamma is ~1960. Numbers align.\n\nThus conclusion, jump time experienced by the astronaut ≈81.6 years, so around 82 years. So answer is approximately 82 years.\n\nBut would the problem expect lengthier reasoning?\n\nAlternatively, is there any effect on acceleration? But mention is that they travel at a constant speed, so that special relativity applies with constant velocity, so no complications from acceleration.\n\nIf the problem states measured from the point of view of the astronaut, the question is indeed equivalent to proper time. Yes.\n\nAnother way would be to compute via the proper time formula:\n\ntau = integral from 0 to t of sqrt(1 - v²/c²) dt, but since velocity is constant, same as sqrt(1 -v²/c²) * t, provided it\'s the same. So, classic relation.\n\nTherefore tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)= t/gamma.\n\nBut since the Earth frame measures t=160,000ly / v ≈ 160,000 /0.99999987 years, then again as 160,000 / 1960≈81 years.\n\nThus that is just confirming again.\n\nTherefore, the astronaut will experience approximately 82 years during the trip, leading to total age of 22 + 82 = 104 years old, under the average lifespan of 150. So it\'s manageable.\n\nHence conclusion, the answer is about 82 years.\n\nFinal check: if 160,000 light-years’ distance, at 0.99999987 gives gamma of around 2000 (but calculated as 1960), result clock time about 81 years. So so. Therefore, approximately 82 years.\n\nProbably can be written as approximately \\boxed{82} years.\n\nOnly remaining concern: reassess the computation for the precise gamma. Let\'s calculate sqrt(2.6e-7).\n\n2.6e-7 exact sqrt:\n\nWe can use sqrt(2.6e-7)= sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.\n\nWait, actually, ln(sqrt(2.6e-7))).\n\nAlternatively, log table: lg(2.6)≈0.41497, so log10(2.6e-7)=0.41497 -7= -6.58503, so 10^(-6.58503)=10^(-6 -0.58503)=10^-6 *10^-0.58503. 10^-0.58503≈0.26, so with log(key):\n\nWait, 10^-0.585 is approx. 0.26 thus sqrt(2.6e-7)=5.099e-4? Let me compute 5.099e-4 squared.\n\n(5.099e-4)^2=25.998e-8=~2.5998e-7≈2.6e-7. Which correlates.\n\nThus, definitively, sqrt(2.6e-7)=~0.0005099, hence gamma=approx1960. if need be, more precise, say using higher accuracy:\n\nAh, if potential, perhaps retry.\n\nIf we compute sqrt(2.6e-7), perhaps double-check.\n\nSo, use recursive sqrt calculation:\n\nTake S = 0.0005099\n\nAssuming that, S^2= (5.099e-4)^2=0.00000025998.\n\nCompare to 2.6e-7=0.00000026. So 256 would be 0.000000256, if terms. Hence where we got S≈5.099e-4 gives S²= ~2.5998e-7=0.25998e-6, which is extremely close. So far, that\'s the correct value.\n\nTherefore gamma=1/0.0005099= Approximately 1960.784. Yes.\n\nThus, we can confidently say that the gamma factor is about 1960.78.

To determine the time it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we need to consider relativistic time dilation. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud**: The approximate distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud is 160,000 light-years.

2. **Speed of the spacecraft**: The spacecraft travels at a constant speed of \(0.99999987c\).

3. **Time from Earth's perspective**: The time taken for the journey from Earth's frame of reference is calculated by:
   \[
   t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{160,000 \text{ ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000.0208 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Lorentz factor (γ)**: The Lorentz factor is calculated using the velocity \(v = 0.99999987c\):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Substituting \(v = 0.99999987c\):
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}
   \]
   \[
   \gamma \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}} \approx 1960.78
   \]

5. **Proper time experienced by the astronaut**: The proper time \(\tau\) is given by dividing the Earth-frame time by the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000.0208}{1960.78} \approx 81.6 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the journey will take approximately \(\boxed{82}\) years from the astronaut's perspective.

Alternatively, but that's only fractional, like a tiny speed difference. Therefore, probably, from Earth’s frame, the time would be just 160,000/(0.99999987) years. Which as you said, is approximately 160,000*(1 + 1.3e-7) which is like 160,000 + 0.0208, as any small number. Indeed, so approximately 160,000.02 years. So, very close to 160,000 years from Earth's perspective.

But then, proper time is the traveler's time. So, τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since your lifetime concerns the astronaut's frame. Let's compute γ first. The velocity is 0.99999987c. Let's compute v²/c²: equal to (0.99999987)^2. Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

But (0.99999987)^2 is 1 - (2.6*10^{-7} + negligible terms). Let's verify.

If you have (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small.

But our velocity is actually 0.99999987, which is 1 - 1.3e-7. Wait: Since 1 - 0.99999987 is 0.00000013, so x = 1.3e-7. So 1 - x.

Therefore, the Lorentz factor is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) ≈ 1/sqrt(2x - x²) ≈ 1/sqrt(2x) because x is really small (x is 1.3e-7).

But we need to compute 1 - v^2/c^2. With v = (1 - δ)c where δ =1.3e-7. So, v = c(1 - δ).

Then, v²/c² = (1 - δ)^2 = 1 - 2δ + δ² ≈ 1 - 2δ, since δ² is negligible.

Hence, 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2δ = 2 * 1.3e-7 = 2.6e-7.

Thus, the gamma factor, γ, is 1/sqrt(2δ) = 1/sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that. sq rt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, what's the square root of 2.6e-7?

sqrt(ab) = sqrt(a) * sqrt(b), so sqrt(2.6) is approximately 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 = 1e-3*sqrt(10) kind of.

Alternatively, 2.6e-7 can be written as 26e-8, so sqrt(26e-8) = sqrt(26)*sqrt(1e-8) = 5.099*1e-4 = approximately 5.099e-4. Then, 1/gamma is sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4. Hence gamma ≈ 1/(5.099e-4) ≈ 1960 (since 1/5.099e-4 ≈ 1/0.0005099 ≈ 1960). Let me verify with precise calculation:

sqrt(2.6e-7): 2.6e-7 = 0.00000026

Take sqrt of 0.00000026: sqrt(26)*1e-4: sqrt(25) = 5, sqrt(26)=5.099 as above, so approximately 0.0005099. Then, the gamma factor is 1/0.0005099 = approx 1960.8. So gamma ≈ 1960.8. Therefore, Lorentz factor is roughly 1960.8.

Thus, the trip duration from Earth's perspective is 160,000.0208 years, as earlier, but from the astronaut's perspective, the proper time τ is Earth's time divided by gamma, so 160,000.0208 / 1960.8 ≈ approximately 81.6 years.

Wait, let's calculate that.

160,000.0208 years divided by 1960.8 is approximately: 160,000 / 1960.8 ≈ Since 1960.8 *80= 156,864. 1960.8*81=156,864 + 1960.8=158,824.8. 1960.8*82=158,824.8 + 1960.8=160,785.6. So 160,000 years is between 81 and 82 years. Specifically, 160,000 -158,824.8=1,175.2 at 1960.8 per year. Therefore, 1,175.2 /1960.8 ≈ 0.598 years (about 7 months). So total is 81.598 years, approximately 81.6 years. So the astronaut would experience around 81.6 years.

But of course, considering that the actual time from Earth's frame is a smidge over 160,000 years, taking that factor in:

Let's compute more accurately:

Earth time, t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 × 1.0000001300…≈ 160,000 + (160,000 × 1.3e-7). 160,000×1.3e-7 = 0.0208. So, approximately t ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

Then, gamma is calculated as 1960.8. Therefore, tau ( proper time) = t / gamma ≈ 160,000.0208 / 1960.8 ≈ 81.6 years.

Therefore, the astronaut would age about 81.6 years during the journey.

Wait, the problem mentions the average lifetime of these aliens is approximately 150 years. Their astronaut is 22 years old. So 22 + 81.6 = 103.6 years old upon arrival. So within their lifespan.

But the answer to the question is "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach Earth?" So it's just the proper time, around 81.6 years, so approximately 82 years.

But wait, let's be even more precise.

To compute Gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Given v=0.99999987 c.

Therefore,

v = 0.99999987c

v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2.

Expand that:

(1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14

Thus,

1 - v^2/c^2 ≈ 2.6e-7 - (1.69e-14), which is about 2.6e-7 (since 1.69e-14 is negligible)

Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute sqrt(2.6e-7).

sqrt(2.6) ≈ 1.61245.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.61245 * (1e-3.5). However, sqrt(1e-7) is exp( (1/2) * ln(1e-7) ) = (1e-7)^(1/2) =1e-3.5. Then 1e-3.5 is 1e-3 *1e-0.5 ≈ 0.001 * 0.3162 ≈ 0.0003162.

Thus sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈1.61245 *0.0003162≈ 0.0005100.

So gamma =1 /0.0005100 ≈1960.78.

Thus, to more decimal points, gamma ≈ 1960.78.

Thus, tau =160,000 /0.99999987 /1960.78 ≈160,000.0208/1960.78≈81.598 years… ≈81.6 years.

So approx. 81.6 years. Therefore, answer is approximately 82 years.

But we need to consider another possible approach - the astronaut's own measurement. Wait, perhaps an alternative method. Since, in the astronaut's frame, the distance is length contracted, so L = L0 / gamma. Hence, Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud are moving towards them at velocity v, and the distance is contracted.

So, L = 160,000 ly / gamma.

Therefore, time = distance/speed.

So τ = L /v = (160,000 ly / gamma) /0.99999987 c.

But since 1 ly/year = c. Therefore, ly / (c) is years. So that simplifies.

Thus,

τ = (160,000 /gamma)/0.99999987 which is 160,000 / (gamma*0.99999987).

But gamma is 1960.78, so:

1960.78*0.99999987 ≈1960.78*(1 - 1.3e-7)≈1960.78 - 0.000254 ≈1960.7797 approximately.

Therefore, τ≈160,000 /1960.7797≈81.598≈ the same 81.6 years.

So, same answer.

Alternatively, we might use more precise computation if we retain more digits. However, with the numbers provided, 0.99999987c is an incredibly high gamma factor. Thus, γ is ≈1960, Earth time is ≈160,000 years, and properτ≈160,000 / 1960≈81.6 years.Therefore, the proper time is approximately 82 years.

But check if all quantities are correctly substituted.

Another point of attention: the problem states "the Large Magellanic Cloud" to Earth. If there’s uncertainty about the distance, perhaps taking more recent data, but perhaps for purposes here, assuming 160k ly is okay. If the actual distance is different, answer may change, but since the problem doesn't specify, proceed with that. The NASA website says that the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. So that would lead to 163,000 divided by same gamma. But using 160,000 vs 163,000 will result in a two percent difference.

But as problem says "approximate", therefore 160,000 leads to 81.6, but if 163k /1960 would be around 163000/1960≈83.16 years. So, depending on real distance. But if not given specific distance, we go with our initial data.

Alternatively, what if a better approximation exact is indeed needing 160k ly. So, if influenced precise gamma...

Wait, wait a moment. The initial thing is 0.99999987c. How exactly gamma is here. Compute gamma again. Compute Beta as v/c = .99999987.

Beta squared = (0.99999987)^2:

First, write as (1 - 0.00000013). Then compute (1 - δ)^2 where δ = 1.3e-7:

(1 - δ)^2 = 1 - 2δ + δ².

So≈ 1 - 2.6e-7.

Thus, gamma becomes 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). As above, so 2.6e-7 square root taking. However, maybe 2.6e-7 = 26e-8, sqrt(26) is around 5.099, sqrt(1e-8)=1e-4, so 5.099e-4. Gamma =1/(5.099e-4)≈1960.

Moreover, even precise calculation for sqrt(26)*1e-4≈5.099e-4. Thus gamma≈1960.

Alternatively, using exact values: let's compute 1 / sqrt(1 - Beta^2):

Beta =0.99999987.

Beta^2=0.99999974... but perhaps over precision?

Wait, alternative calculator approach.

Compute 0.99999987 squared:

(0.99999987)*(0.99999987)=.

Let me compute (1 - x)^2=1 - 2x + x² where x=0.00000013.

So 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2=0.99999974 + 1.69e-14≈0.999999740000000169≈~0.99999974.

Therefore, 1 minus Beta squared is approx 0.0000002599999998, which is ~2.6e-7, which is the same as before. Therefore, SQRT(2.6e-7)≈~0.0005099, yep. Gamma is ~1960. Numbers align.

Thus conclusion, jump time experienced by the astronaut ≈81.6 years, so around 82 years. So answer is approximately 82 years.

But would the problem expect lengthier reasoning?

Alternatively, is there any effect on acceleration? But mention is that they travel at a constant speed, so that special relativity applies with constant velocity, so no complications from acceleration.

If the problem states measured from the point of view of the astronaut, the question is indeed equivalent to proper time. Yes.

Another way would be to compute via the proper time formula:

tau = integral from 0 to t of sqrt(1 - v²/c²) dt, but since velocity is constant, same as sqrt(1 -v²/c²) * t, provided it's the same. So, classic relation.

Therefore tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)= t/gamma.

But since the Earth frame measures t=160,000ly / v ≈ 160,000 /0.99999987 years, then again as 160,000 / 1960≈81 years.

Thus that is just confirming again.

Therefore, the astronaut will experience approximately 82 years during the trip, leading to total age of 22 + 82 = 104 years old, under the average lifespan of 150. So it's manageable.

Hence conclusion, the answer is about 82 years.

Final check: if 160,000 light-years’ distance, at 0.99999987 gives gamma of around 2000 (but calculated as 1960), result clock time about 81 years. So so. Therefore, approximately 82 years.

Probably can be written as approximately \boxed{82} years.

Only remaining concern: reassess the computation for the precise gamma. Let's calculate sqrt(2.6e-7).

2.6e-7 exact sqrt:

We can use sqrt(2.6e-7)= sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

Wait, actually, ln(sqrt(2.6e-7))).

Alternatively, log table: lg(2.6)≈0.41497, so log10(2.6e-7)=0.41497 -7= -6.58503, so 10^(-6.58503)=10^(-6 -0.58503)=10^-6 *10^-0.58503. 10^-0.58503≈0.26, so with log(key):

Wait, 10^-0.585 is approx. 0.26 thus sqrt(2.6e-7)=5.099e-4? Let me compute 5.099e-4 squared.

(5.099e-4)^2=25.998e-8=~2.5998e-7≈2.6e-7. Which correlates.

Thus, definitively, sqrt(2.6e-7)=~0.0005099, hence gamma=approx1960. if need be, more precise, say using higher accuracy:

Ah, if potential, perhaps retry.

If we compute sqrt(2.6e-7), perhaps double-check.

So, use recursive sqrt calculation:

Take S = 0.0005099

Assuming that, S^2= (5.099e-4)^2=0.00000025998.

Compare to 2.6e-7=0.00000026. So 256 would be 0.000000256, if terms. Hence where we got S≈5.099e-4 gives S²= ~2.5998e-7=0.25998e-6, which is extremely close. So far, that's the correct value.

Therefore gamma=1/0.0005099= Approximately 1960.784. Yes.

Thus, we can confidently say that the gamma factor is about 1960.78. Thus, proper time is tau= t_earth / gamma=160,000.0208 / 1960.78≈approx.

Compute 160,000 ÷ 1960.78=?

1960.78 ×80=156,862.4

1960.78 ×80= approximate: let's do 1960 *80=156,800, then 0.78×80=62.4, total 156,862.4

Difference between 160,000-156,862.4=3,137.6 years.

3,137.6 /1,960.78≈ 3,137.6 /1,960.78≈ approx 1.6.

So, totally, 80+1.6=81.6, which leads to 81.6.

So, answer is approx 81.6 years

So we can write ≈82 years.

Therefore, as requested, approximate is sufficient so boxed answer 82 years, so \boxed{82}

**Final Answer**
The journey will take approximately \boxed{82} years from the astronaut's perspective.
