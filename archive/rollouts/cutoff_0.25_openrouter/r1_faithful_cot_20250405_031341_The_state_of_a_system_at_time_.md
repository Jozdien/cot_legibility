# Original Question

The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable of the system is represented by the matrix operator P having elements in the first row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0),  in the second row as (1/ \sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \sqrt{2}) and in the third row as (0, 1/ \sqrt{2}, 0). Calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t.

To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable \( P \) will yield 0 at time \( t \), given the state vector \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and the matrix \( P \):

1. **Normalize the state vector**:
   The norm of \( \psi \) is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \). The normalized state vector is:
   \[
   \psi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Find the eigenvalue 0 eigenvector of \( P \)**:
   Solving \( Pv = 0 \), we find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 is:
   \[
   v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

3. **Project the normalized state vector onto the eigenvector**:
   Compute the inner product \( \langle v | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \):
   \[
   \left\langle \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \bigg| \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} (-1) + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]
   The magnitude squared of this inner product is:
   \[
   \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the measurement of the observable \( P \) will yield 0 is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me see. I need to calculate the probability that a measurement of the observable P will yield 0 at time t. The system is in the state given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The matrix P is provided with its elements.

First, I remember that the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. So, the steps might be: diagonalize the matrix P to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, identify the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then project the state vector onto that eigenvector and square the magnitude to get the probability.

But wait, maybe there's another way if the eigenvalue 0 has a multiplicity. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvectors without fully diagonalizing the matrix. Let's start by verifying if 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. To check that, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. If λ=0 is a solution, then that's an eigenvalue. Let's compute determinant of P when λ=0, which is just det(P). Let's calculate det(P):

The matrix P is:
[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]

This seems like a symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian, which is good because observables are represented by Hermitian operators.

Determinant of P. Maybe expanding along the first row:

0 * det(minor) - 1/√2 * det(minor) + 0 * det(minor) = -1/√2 * det([1/√2, 1/√2; 1/√2, 0])

Calculate the minor for the (1,2) element: the submatrix after removing row 1 and column 2 is:
[1/√2, 1/√2]
[1/√2, 0]

So determinant of this minor is (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = 0 - (1/2) = -1/2

Therefore, determinant of P is -1/√2 * (-1/2) = (1/√2)*(1/2) = 1/(2√2)

But wait, determinant of P is 1/(2√2). Since determinant is the product of eigenvalues. So the product is 1/(2√2), which is not zero. So 0 is not an eigenvalue of P? But the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring 0. Hmm. This can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in determinant calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, let me recompute the determinant again. Let me write out the matrix:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Computing determinant. Since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps expanding along the first row:

Determinant = 0*(det of minor) - 1/√2*(det of minor) + 0*(det of minor)

The minor for the (1,2) element (since the first non-zero entry in the first row is at column 2):

Minor is the matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[1/√2, 0 ]

determinant is (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = 0 - (1/2) = -1/2

Thus, the determinant is -1/√2 * (-1/2) = (1/√2)* (1/2) = 1/(2√2). So same result. Therefore determinant is positive, so it's not zero. That suggests that 0 is not an eigenvalue. But the question is about measuring 0. That is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, maybe I shouldn't calculate the determinant but directly find if 0 is an eigenvalue.

Suppose λ=0 is an eigenvalue. Then P has a non-trivial kernel. So to check if there exists a non-zero vector such that P * v = 0.

Let’s try solving the equations. Let me write out the equations for Pv = 0:

First component: (0)(v1) + (1/√2)(v2) + 0(v3) = 0 ⇒ (1/√2)v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 ⇒ (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 ⇒ v1 + v3 = 0 ⇒ v3 = -v1.

Third component: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 ⇒ (1/√2)v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0.

Therefore, the solutions (eigenvectors for λ=0) must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvector is of the form (a, 0, -a). So yes, there is a non-trivial solution. Therefore, λ=0 is an eigenvalue. But then why is determinant non-zero? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in determinant computation?

Wait a minute, determinant was found to be 1/(2√2). But if 0 is an eigenvalue, then determinant (product of eigenvalues) should be zero. There is a contradiction here.

Therefore, I must have messed up computing the determinant. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the determinant. Let me use a different approach for the determinant. Maybe by row operations.

Original matrix:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

If I perform row operations, can I get it into upper triangular form? Let me try swapping Row1 and Row2:

Row1: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row2: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Now the matrix is:

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

Now subtract Row2 from Row3:

Row3 becomes [0 - 0, 1/√2 - 1/√2, 0 - 0] = [0, 0, 0]

Thus, the matrix becomes:

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[0, 0, 0 ]

So the determinant is the product of diagonal elements * (-1)^k, where k is the number of row swaps. Here, we swapped once (Row1 and Row2), so determinant of original matrix is (-1) multiplied by the product of the diagonals of the upper triangular matrix.

The product of the diagonals of the upper triangular matrix is 1/√2 * 1/√2 * 0 = 0. Hence, determinant is (-1)*0 = 0. But that contradicts the previous result. So clearly one method was incorrect.

Wait, when swapping rows, the determinant changes sign. But initially, when we swapped Row1 and Row2, determinant becomes negative of the original. Then, after transforming to upper triangular, which now has determinant (upper triangular entries product) 1/√2 * 1/√2 * 0 = 0. Then, original determinant would be (-1)*0 ? Wait, perhaps there's confusion here.

Wait, let me recall. The determinant after swapping rows becomes -det(original). If I proceed to compute the determinant after swapping rows and making it upper triangular, which has a determinant of 0 (since there's a zero on the diagonal). Thus, the swapped matrix det is 0, so the original determinant is -0 = 0. Hence the determinant is indeed 0. Therefore, my first calculation was wrong.

So where did I go wrong in the first approach? I think when I expanded the determinant along the first row. Let me try again.

Original determinant, using the first method: expanding along the first row. The first row is [0, 1/√2, 0]. The determinant is then:

0 * minor - 1/√2 * minor + 0 * minor.

So the only term is -1/√2 times the minor from the (1,2) entry.

The minor is the determinant of the matrix:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[1/√2, 0 ]

Previously, I computed this determinant as (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = -1/2.

But why didn't that take into account the sign for the cofactor?

Wait, actually, when calculating the cofactor expansion, the sign for the (i,j) entry is (-1)^{i+j}. For the (1,2) entry, the sign is (-1)^{1+2} = -1. So when expanding along the first row, the coefficient is -1^{1+2} * 1/√2 * minor.

Wait, let me rephrase.

The formula for the determinant via expansion along the first row is:

Σ_{j=1}^3 [ (-1)^{1+j} * P_{1j} * M_{1j} ]

Where M_{1j} is the minor.

So for j=1: (-1)^{1+1}=1, times P_{11}=0, times minor, which is irrelevant due to 0.

j=2: (-1)^{1+2}= -1 times P_{12}=1/√2 times minor of (1,2), which is determinant of the matrix obtained by removing row1 and column2.

The minor as before is:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[1/√2, 0 ]

Which determinant is (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = -1/2.

Thus, j=2 term is -1 * (1/√2) * (-1/2) = (1/√2)*(1/2). Then j=3 term is again 0.

Therefore total determinant is 0 + (1/(2√2)) + 0 = 1/(2√2). But via row operations, determinant should be 0. Therefore, Which one is correct?

Wait, but row operations showed that the determinant is 0, so cofactor expansion must have a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe my row operations have an error. Let's check the row operations again.

Original matrix:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Swap Row1 and Row2, determinant becomes -det(original).

New matrix:

Row1: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row2: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Now, if we compute the determinant here, using cofactor expansion:

Row1: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2. Let's expand along Row1:

1/√2 * det([1/√2, 0; 1/√2, 0]) - 0 * det(...) + 1/√2 * det([0, 1/√2; 1/√2, 0]).

Compute first minor: det([1/√2, 0; 1/√2, 0]) = (1/√2 * 0) - (0 * 1/√2) = 0.

Third term: 1/√2 * det([0, 1/√2; 1/√2, 0]) = 1/√2 * [0*0 - 1/√2*1/√2] = 1/√2 * (-1/2) = -1/(2√2)

But since we swapped rows, the determinant of the original is the negative of this matrix's determinant. But let me check the determinant after swapping.

Wait, no, after swapping rows, the new matrix determinant is -det(original). Therefore, original determinant is -det(new matrix).

But in the swapped matrix, we tried to compute the determinant and found -1/(2√2) via cofactor. Wait, that suggests determinant of the swapped matrix is -1/(2√2), then original determinant is -(-1/(2√2)) = 1/(2√2). Which contradicts row operations.

Hmmm, this is confusing. Therefore, conclusion is that there's an error somewhere in my calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the determinant is non-zero but 0 is still an eigenvalue. For instance, a matrix can have a zero eigenvalue even if determinant is non-zero? Wait, no. The determinant is the product of eigenvalues. If determinant is non-zero, all eigenvalues are non-zero. But from the system of equations Pv=0, the kernel is non-trivial. Therefore, determinant must be zero.

There must be an inconsistency here.

Wait, maybe I got confused. If solving Pv=0 gives non-trivial solutions, then determinant is zero. But In my first cofactor expansion I found determinant 1/(2√2), whereas via row operations, ended up with determinant zero.

But when swapping rows and performing row operations, the determinant is zero, implying determinant of P is zero, hence 0 is an eigenvalue.

But a matrix cannot have determinant both 0 and non-zero, so where is the mistake?

Ah! Wait, when I perform the first method (after expanding and getting 1/(2√2)), the mistake must be in the row operations. Let me check that.

After swapping Row1 and Row2, then:

Row1: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row2: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Then, subtract Row2 from Row3. So Row3 becomes Row3 - Row2:

0 - 0, 1/√2 - 1/√2, 0 - 0 => [0, 0, 0]. So now, the matrix becomes upper triangular with diagonal entries 1/√2, 1/√2, 0.

Thus, the determinant is 1/√2 * 1/√2 * 0 = 0. Since we only performed one row swap (sign change) and row operations that don't affect determinant (subtracting rows), then the original determinant is zero.

But in cofactor expansion, if we have a parameter, determinant is 1/(2√2).

This contradiction suggests that my cofactor expansion was incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps swapping the rows in reality? Let me check if this is indeed the same matrix. Wait, no, actually, maybe I made a miscalculation when doing cofactor expansion.

Wait, to verify, perhaps use another method. For example, calculate the trace. If trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. The trace is sum of eigenvalues. determinant is product. If determinant is zero, so at least one eigenvalue is zero.

But the trace being zero suggests that the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

So eigenvalues are λ1, λ2, 0. Then sum is λ1 + λ2 = 0, product is λ1 * λ2 * 0 = 0.

So the determinant being zero matches. Therefore, that seems plausible.

But in the cofactor expansion, I need to find the error. So in the initial cofactor expansion, I consider P as follows:

First row: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Minor for (1,2) entry is the submatrix:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[1/√2, 0 ]

Which determinant is (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = 0 - 1/2 = -1/2.

Then, adding the sign (-1)^{1+2}= -1. So term is (-1)*1/√2*(-1/2) = 1/(2√2). So determinant is 1/(2√2). But according to the other method, determinant is 0. So, this is contradictory.

Wait, absolutely. That can't be. Then There must be an error in the cofactor calculation.

Wait, inverse contradiction arises: this suggests one of them is wrong.

But checking again expansion by minors, let me copy the original matrix:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

So determinant calculated via expansion along the first row is 0*M11 -1/√2 * M12 + 0 * M13, where M12 is determinant of:

Row2 and Row3 with Column2 removed:

Row2: [1/√2, 1/√2]

Row3: [0, 0 ]

Wait a minute, hold on. If we remove row1 and column2 from the original matrix, then the minor M12 matrix should be:

Row2 and Row3 with column2 removed. So:

Original columns are 1,2,3. Remove column2, so columns 1 and 3.

Row2: column1=1/√2, column3=1/√2

Row3: column1=0, column3=0

Hence, the minor matrix is:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[0, 0 ]

Therefore determinant of minor is (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 0) = 0.

Therefore, the minor determinant M12 is 0. Therefore, the j=2 term is (-1)^{1+2} * 1/√2 * 0 = 0.

Thus, total determinant from first row expansion is 0 - 0 + 0 = 0. Therefore the determinant is 0. Aha, I messed up the minor matrix before.

Previously, I thought that the minor after removing row1 and column2, the remaining entries would be Row2: [1/√2, 1/√2], Row3: [1/√2, 0]. But that is incorrect. Because removing column2 from original matrix for the minor M12, we remove column2, leaving columns1 and columns3:

Row1 was 0 (column1), 1/√2 (column2), 0 (column3). Removing column2:

Original row2 is 1/√2 (column1), 0 (column2), 1/√2 (column3). After removing column2: 1/√2 (column1), 1/√2 (column3).

Row3: 0 (column1), 1/√2 (column2), 0 (column3). After removing column2: 0 (column1), 0 (column3).

Thus, minor matrix is indeed:

Row2: [1/√2, 1/√2]

Row3: [0, 0 ]

Thus, the determinant of this minor is (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(0) = 0. Therefore, indeed, the j=2 term in the cofactor expansion is (-1)^{1+2} * (1/√2) * 0 = 0.

Hence, determinant is 0. Therefore, my initial calculation was wrong because I had the minor matrix incorrect. 

Thus, determinant is 0. Therefore, 0 is an eigenvalue. So good. Now I need to find the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0.

Wait, from above, when solving Pv = 0:

We obtained that the eigenvectors have v2 = 0, and v1 + v3 = 0. Therefore, they are of the form (a, 0, -a). Thus, the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional or two-dimensional?

The solution space is given by v2=0 and v3= -v1. Thus, it's one-dimensional, parametrized by a.

Therefore, the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). So, the normalized eigenvector would be (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Because for eigenvector (1,0,-1), the norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so normalized as (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Alternatively, any multiple of that.

Now, the system is in state vector |ψ> = column vector (-1, 2, 1).

We need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0. So we project |ψ> onto the eigenspace corresponding to λ=0. Since the eigenspace is one-dimensional, we can take the normalized eigenvector v = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). The projection is |<v|ψ>|^2.

Compute inner product <v|ψ>:

v† ⋅ ψ = (1/√2)* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Then, the absolute value squared is | -√2 |^2 = (√2)^2 = 2.

Wait, but probability can't exceed 1. Wait, this can't be. So clearly, I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's check the inner product:

v is a column vector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

State vector |ψ> is (-1, 2, 1)^T.

Inner product v†ψ is (1/√2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

But then the magnitude squared is (√2)^2 = 2, but probabilities must sum to 1. This suggests something is wrong. The issue here might be in the normalization of the eigenvector or the probability calculation.

Wait, if the eigenvalue 0 is obtained with a projection that yields an inner product with magnitude greater than 1, that is impossible, since probabilities can't exceed 1. So, perhaps the eigenvector was not properly normalized.

Wait, the eigenvector in the null space is (a, 0, -a). Let's take a=1 for simplicity: (1, 0, -1). The norm of this vector is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). Thus, the normalized eigenvector should be 1/√2 * (1, 0, -1). Hence, correct.

But calculating the inner product:

⟨v | ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2. Then |⟨v | ψ⟩|^2 = (√2)^2 = 2. Which is more than 1.

Clearly, this can't be. Therefore, where is the mistake?

Alternatively, maybe the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is two-dimensional?

Wait, but from before, solving Pv=0 gives equations v2=0 and v1 + v3 =0. So it's one equation (since v2=0 and v1 + v3=0), so solution space is 3 - 2 = 1 dimension. Wait, how many equations?

Let’s see. When we solve Pv =0, the system is:

1. (1/√2) v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0

2. (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 ⇒ v1 + v3 =0

3. (1/√2)v2 =0 ⇒ v2=0

Thus, actually three equations but two are same as first. Hence, two independent equations: v2=0 and v1 +v3=0. Therefore, solution space is 3 -2=1 dimensional. Thus, eigenspace is indeed one-dimensional.

Therefore, can eigenvectors for 0 be normalized? Presumably so.

But the problem arises with projection having a magnitude squared >1. But that's impossible.

Therefore, maybe my misunderstanding. Wait, the state vector is (-1,2,1). Its norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the vector is not normalized. Oops!.

The state vector is given as a column matrix (-1,2,1). But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized (norm 1). Therefore, should I first normalize the state vector before calculating probabilities?

Wait, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)". If it's just given as a column matrix, but not stated whether it's normalized, does that mean we have to normalize it first?

But in some cases, the problem may present state vectors that are not normalized and expect the user to normalize in probability calculations. Wait, let's check.

The standard formula for the probability is |⟨v | ψ⟩|², where |v⟩ is the normalized eigenvector. But, if |ψ⟩ is not normalized, and in the problem they just give the state as a vector (not necessarily unit vector), then implicitly, are we supposed to assume that it's already normalized? For instance, in a physics context, state vectors must have unit norm. If ψ is not normalized, that is a problem.

Therefore, the vector given is (-1, 2, 1). Its norm squared is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2=1 +4 +1=6. Therefore, the normalized vector is (1/√6)(-1, 2, 1).

Therefore, we need to normalize the given state vector first before computing inner products, otherwise the probabilities can be greater than 1.

Probably, the question didn't mention normalization because it might have presumed that the vector is already normalized or expects that the user will normalize. It is a question in quantum mechanics, so in that case, state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors. Therefore, the given vector must be normalized. Therefore, the student should first compute the normalized state.

Therefore, first, I will normalize the state vector.

Given vector: (-1, 2, 1)

Norm squared = 1 +4 +1=6, so norm = √6.

Thus, normalized state vector is:

( -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 )

Ok. So projecting this vector onto the eigenvector v = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ). Thus, compute inner product:

⟨v | ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(-1/√6) + 0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)(1/√6) 

= [ -1/(√2√6) -1/(√2√6) ]

= [ -2/(√2√6) ]

= [ -2 ] / (√12 )

Simplify √12 = 2√3, so:

= [ -2 ] / (2√3 ) = -1/√3.

The absolute value squared is | -1/√3 |² = 1/3.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

But let me check each step carefully:

First, normalize the state vector:

Original vector: [ -1, 2, 1 ]

Norm squared: 1 +4 +1=6, so norm is √6, so each component divided by √6: (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 )

Check norm squared again: (1/6 +4/6 +1/6)=6/6=1, yes.

Normalized eigenvector v for λ=0 is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2 ). Check its norm: (1/2 +0 +1/2)=1, correct.

Compute ⟨v | ψ⟩:

= (1/√2)(-1/√6 ) + 0*(2/√6 ) + (-1/√2)(1/√6 )

= (-1)/(√2√6 ) + 0 + (-1)/(√2√6 )

Sum them: -2/(√2√6 )

Simplify denominator:

√2√6 = √12 = 2√3. Therefore, -2/(2√3 ) = -1/√3.

Hence, modulus squared is (1/√3 )² = 1/3.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Therefore, conclusion: probability is 1/3.

But wait, the system's state was given as (-1,2,1), but was not stated to be normalized. Thus the question is a bit ambiguous. However, in standard quantum mechanics settings, state vectors are required to be normalized. Thus, we must have normalized it. If we don't, calculate the raw projection:

 earlier, we saw that projecting the original vector (-1,2,1) onto v=(1/√2,0,-1/√2 ) gives (-√2). Then modulus squared is 2. Therefore, the "probability" would be 2, which is impossible. Hence, the need to normalize. So I think yes, it's required. Thus, answer is 1/3.

Another way to check: when you see that after normalization of the state vector, the probability is 1/3. Conclusively, 1/3.

Wait but What if I follow the other way: If operator P has a zero eigenvalue, and the system is in the state |ψ>. But if the state is not normalized, does P have multiple eigenvalues?

Alternatively, if vectors are not required to be normalized, but outputting probabilities sum to more than 1. But Presence of non-zero probability doesn't necessarily sum to anything If only one eigenvalue is considered. However, in practical, all probabilities must sum to 1. Thus, my conclusion, problem expects state vector to be normalized. Therefore, as per standard convention, answer is 1/3.

However,

Let me check the observable P and eigensystem. Operator P is Hermitian, so has real eigenvalues. Let's see another eigenvalue/eigenvector. Along with previous eigenvalue given: After solving for λ=0, the other eigenvalues?

Suppose find the eigenvalues of P.

Because trace is 0 +0 +0=0 and determinant is 0, so eigenvalues sum to zero and product zero. Hence, I think, let’s see, possible eigenvalues ?

Since 0 is an eigenvalue, then other two sum to zero hence λ and -λ.

Take that Try some guesses. Make a guess if possible eigenvectors.

Alternative, looking at the matrix, which is with structure similar to spin operators or the like.

 look at matrix P:

Rows:

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

Observe Then: besides the eigenvector we found, (1, 0, -1), another possible eigenvectors: maybe symmetric vectors like (1, something, 1)？

Let’s test.

Suppose vector (1, a, 1). Apply P to it.

P * (1, a, 1) = [0*1 + 1/√2 * a + 0*1, 1/√2 *1 +0*a +1/√2 *1 ,0*1 +1/√2 *a +0 *1] = [ a/√2 , 2/√2, a/√2 ]

So, to be an eigenvector, the result must be proportional to (1, a, 1). So:

a/√2 = λ *1,

2/√2 = λ *a,

a/√2 = λ*1.

Hence, from first and third components: a/√2 = λ, so λ= a/√2.

From the second component: 2/√2 = λ * a => λ * a= 2/√2 = √2.

But λ= a/√2, so substituting:

(a/√2 ) * a = √2

=> a² / √2 = √2

=> a² = (√2 ) * √2 = 2

=> a= √2 or a= -√2

Thus, if a=√2, then:

λ= a/√2 = √2 /√2=1

Conversely, if a= -√2, then λ= -√2 /√2= -1

Therefore, another Two eigenvectors: (1, √2,1 ) and (1, -√2,1). To check, let's see.

First eigenvector: (1, √2,1 ). Let's compute P*(1, √2,1 ).

First component: 0*1 +1/√2 *√2 +0*1 =1/√2 * √2=1

Second component:1/√2 *1 + 0*√2 +1/√2*1= 2/√2=√2

Third component:0*1 +1/√2 *√2 +0*1=1

Therefore, indeed P*(1, √2,1)= (1, √2,1). So eigenvalue 1.

Similarly, for vector (1, -√2,1):

P*(1, -√2,1 ):

First component:0*1 +1/√2 * (-√2 ) +0*1= -1/√2 *√2= -1

Second component:1/√2*1 +0*(-√2 ) +1/√2 *1= 2/√2=√2. Third component:0*1 +1/√2*(-√2 ) +0*1= -1.

Thus, P*(1, -√2,1 )= (-1, √2, -1). Compare to λ * (1, -√2,1 ), which for eigenvalue -1, expecting:

-1*(1, -√2,1 )= (-1, √2, -1 ), which matches exactly. Therefore, eigenvector (1,-√2,1 ) belongs to eigenvalue -1.

Check one of the components norm:

Eigenvecttor (1, √2,1 ), norm squared=1 +2 +1=4, thus normalized vector is (1/2, √2/2,1/2 )

Similarly, (1,-√2,1 ), norm squared=4, so normalized to (1/2, -√2/2,1/2 )

And λ=0 eigenvector is (1, 0, -1 ) normalized to (1/√2,0,-1/√2 )

Let’s verify that these form an orthogonal set.

Orthogonality between eigenvectors for different eigenvalues.

Between (1/√2,0,-1/√2 ) and (1/2, √2/2,1/2 ):

 inner product:

(1/√2)(1/2) +0*(√2/2 ) + (-1/√2)(1/2 )= (1/(2√2 ) - 1/(2√2 ))=0, yes.

Similarly between (1/√2,0,-1/√2 ) and (1/2, -√2/2,1/2 )：

(1/√2)(1/2 ) +0*(-√2 /2 ) + (-1/√2)(1/2 )= same as above, =0.

Between (1/2, √2/2,1/2 ) and (1/2, -√2 /2 ,1/2 ):</inner product:

(1/2)(1/2 ) + (√2 /2)(-√2 /2 ) + (1/2)(1/2 )= 

1/4 + (-2/4 ) + 1/4 = (1 - 2 +1)/4=0.

So orthogonality holds.

Thus, the three eigenvectors are orthogonal and can form a basis.

Therefore, to facilitate two ways,, if Any state vector can be written as a combination of these eigenvectors,, then the probabilities are the squares of magnitude of the projected coefficients.

Therefore,se, For the given normalized state vector | có cơ thể tốt đẹp(-1/√6, 2/√6,1/√6 ). Let's express it in terms of the matrix P's eigenvectors.

First,List of normalized eigenvectors:

For λ=0：

v0= (1/√2, 0, -1/√2 )

For λ=1：

v1= (1/2, √2/2, 1/2 )

For λ=-1:

v2= (1/2, -√2/2, 1/2 )

The state vector is ψ = (-1/√6, 2/√6,1/√6 )

Express psi as a linear combination of v0, v1, v2.

Thus：

ψ = a*v0 + b*v1 + c*v2

Then, inner product with v0: <v0 | ψ> =a*, since vectors are orthogonal.

But length Can calculate a then.

SoCompute a= <v0 | ψ>:

(1/√2)(-1/√6 ) +0*(2/√6 ) + (-1/√2)(1/√6 )= (-1 -1)/√(12 )= -2/(2√3 )= -1/√3 as before. So a= -1/√3, magnitude squared 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3. 

Yes, the same as before. Therefore, answer is 1/3.

Confirming that the sum of probabilities is 1 check:

 probabilities are |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2.

But since we found a= -1/√3, need to find b and c.

Compute <v1 | ψ>:

(1/2)(-1/√6 ) + (√2/2)(2/√6 ) + (1/2)(1/√6 )

=> (-1/(2√6 )) + (2√2/(2√6 )) +1/(2√6 )

= [ (-1 +1 )/(2√6 ) ] + (√2 /√6 )

= 0 + (√2 /√6 ) = (√2 )/(√6 ) = (√2 )/(√2 √3 )= 1/√3.

So b=1/√3, magnitude squared 1/3.

Similarly, compute <v2 | ψ>:

(1/2)( -1/√6 ) + (-√2 /2)(2/√6 ) + (1/2)(1/√6 )

= (-1)/(2√6 ) + (-2√2)/(2√6 ) +1/(2√6 )

= [ (-1 -2√2 +1 )/(2√6 ) ]

= [ -2√2 / (2√6 ) ] = -√2 /√6 = -1/√3.

Thus, c= -1/√3, magnitude squared 1/3.

Therefore, total probabilities: 1/3 +1/3 +1/3 =1.

Yup. Therefore correct.

Therefore, when measuring P, the probability of getting 0 is 1/3. 

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.


**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let me see. I need to calculate the probability that a measurement of the observable P will yield 0 at time t. The system is in the state given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The matrix P is provided with its elements.

First, I remember that the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. So, the steps might be: diagonalize the matrix P to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, identify the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then project the state vector onto that eigenvector and square the magnitude to get the probability.

But wait, maybe there's another way if the eigenvalue 0 has a multiplicity. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvectors without fully diagonalizing the matrix. Let's start by verifying if 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P. To check that, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. If λ=0 is a solution, then that's an eigenvalue. Let's compute determinant of P when λ=0, which is just det(P). Let's calculate det(P):

The matrix P is:
[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]

This seems like a symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian, which is good because observables are represented by Hermitian operators.

Determinant of P. Maybe expanding along the first row:

0 * det(minor) - 1/√2 * det(minor) + 0 * det(minor) = -1/√2 * det([1/√2, 1/√2; 1/√2, 0])

Calculate the minor for the (1,2) element: the submatrix after removing row 1 and column 2 is:
[1/√2, 1/√2]
[1/√2, 0]

So determinant of this minor is (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = 0 - (1/2) = -1/2

Therefore, determinant of P is -1/√2 * (-1/2) = (1/√2)*(1/2) = 1/(2√2)

But wait, determinant of P is 1/(2√2). Since determinant is the product of eigenvalues. So the product is 1/(2√2), which is not zero. So 0 is not an eigenvalue of P? But the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring 0. Hmm. This can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in determinant calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, let me recompute the determinant again. Let me write out the matrix:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

Computing determinant. Since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps expanding along the first row:

Determinant = 0*(det of minor) - 1/√2*(det of minor) + 0*(det of minor)

The minor for the (1,2) element (since the first non-zero entry in the first row is at column 2):

Minor is the matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[1/√2, 0 ]

determinant is (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = 0 - (1/2) = -1/2

Thus, the determinant is -1/√2 * (-1/2) = (1/√2)* (1/2) = 1/(2√2). So same result. Therefore determinant is positive, so it's not zero. That suggests that 0 is not an eigenvalue. But the question is about measuring 0. That is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Wait, maybe I shouldn't calculate the determinant but directly find if 0 is an eigenvalue.

Suppose λ=0 is an eigenvalue. Then P has a non-trivial kernel. So to check if there exists a non-zero vector such that P * v = 0.

Let’s try solving the equations. Let me write out the equations for Pv = 0:

First component: (0)(v1) + (1/√2)(v2) + 0(v3) = 0 ⇒ (1/√2)v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 ⇒ (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 ⇒ v1 + v3 = 0 ⇒ v3 = -v1.

Third component: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 ⇒ (1/√2)v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0.

Therefore, the solutions (eigenvectors for λ=0) must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvector is of the form (a, 0, -a). So yes, there is a non-trivial solution. Therefore, λ=0 is an eigenvalue. But then why is determinant non-zero? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in determinant computation?

Wait a minute, determinant was found to be 1/(2√2). But if 0 is an eigenvalue, then determinant (product of eigenvalues) should be zero. There is a contradiction here.

Therefore, I must have messed up computing the determinant. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding the determinant. Let me use a different approach for the determinant. Maybe by row operations.

Original matrix:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

If I perform row operations, can I get it into upper triangular form? Let me try swapping Row1 and Row2:

Row1: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row2: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Now the matrix is:

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

Now subtract Row2 from Row3:

Row3 becomes [0 - 0, 1/√2 - 1/√2, 0 - 0] = [0, 0, 0]

Thus, the matrix becomes:

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[0, 0, 0 ]

So the determinant is the product of diagonal elements * (-1)^k, where k is the number of row swaps. Here, we swapped once (Row1 and Row2), so determinant of original matrix is (-1) multiplied by the product of the diagonals of the upper triangular matrix.

The product of the diagonals of the upper triangular matrix is 1/√2 * 1/√2 * 0 = 0. Hence, determinant is (-1)*0 = 0. But that contradicts the previous result. So clearly one method was incorrect.

Wait, when swapping rows, the determinant changes sign. But initially, when we swapped Row1 and Row2, determinant becomes negative of the original. Then, after transforming to upper triangular, which now has determinant (upper triangular entries product) 1/√2 * 1/√2 * 0 = 0. Then, original determinant would be (-1)*0 ? Wait, perhaps there's confusion here.

Wait, let me recall. The determinant after swapping rows becomes -det(original). If I proceed to compute the determinant after swapping rows and making it upper triangular, which has a determinant of 0 (since there's a zero on the diagonal). Thus, the swapped matrix det is 0, so the original determinant is -0 = 0. Hence the determinant is indeed 0. Therefore, my first calculation was wrong.

So where did I go wrong in the first approach? I think when I expanded the determinant along the first row. Let me try again.

Original determinant, using the first method: expanding along the first row. The first row is [0, 1/√2, 0]. The determinant is then:

0 * minor - 1/√2 * minor + 0 * minor.

So the only term is -1/√2 times the minor from the (1,2) entry.

The minor is the determinant of the matrix:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[1/√2, 0 ]

Previously, I computed this determinant as (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = -1/2.

But why didn't that take into account the sign for the cofactor?

Wait, actually, when calculating the cofactor expansion, the sign for the (i,j) entry is (-1)^{i+j}. For the (1,2) entry, the sign is

# Anthropic completion

Alright, let me examine this. I need to find the probability that a measurement of observable P will yield 0 at time t. The system is in the state represented by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The matrix P is given as:
[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]

I recall that to calculate the probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue, I need to square the absolute value of the projection of the state vector onto the corresponding eigenvector. This means I should: diagonalize matrix P to identify its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, find eigenvectors associated with eigenvalue 0, project the state vector onto that eigenvector, and square the magnitude to obtain the probability.

I could try an alternative approach if eigenvalue 0 has a multiplicity, or perhaps find eigenvectors without complete diagonalization. First, I should verify if 0 is an eigenvalue of P by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. If λ=0 is a solution, then it's an eigenvalue.

The matrix P appears symmetric, making it Hermitian, which is appropriate since observables are represented by Hermitian operators.

Let me calculate the determinant of P. Initially expanding along the first row:
0 * det(minor) - 1/√2 * det(minor) + 0 * det(minor) = -1/√2 * det([1/√2, 1/√2; 1/√2, 0])

The minor for the (1,2) element is:
[1/√2, 1/√2]
[1/√2, 0]

I calculated this determinant as (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = -1/2

Thus, determinant of P would be -1/√2 * (-1/2) = 1/(2√2)

This is puzzling because if the determinant is 1/(2√2), which is non-zero, then 0 shouldn't be an eigenvalue. Yet the problem asks about measuring 0.

Let me try another approach - directly checking if 0 is an eigenvalue by looking for a non-zero vector v where P * v = 0.

Solving the system Pv = 0:
First equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 → v2 = 0
Second equation: (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v3 = -v1
Third equation: (1/√2)v2 = 0 → v2 = 0

This gives eigenvectors of form (a, 0, -a), confirming 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. This contradicts my determinant calculation.

Let me recalculate using row operations. After swapping Row1 and Row2, and subtracting Row2 from Row3, the matrix becomes:
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]
[0, 0, 0]

The determinant is the product of diagonal elements multiplied by (-1)^k where k is the number of row swaps. With one swap, the determinant is (-1) * (1/√2 * 1/√2 * 0) = 0.

So 0 is indeed an eigenvalue of P, and my first calculation contained an error. I probably didn't correctly account for the cofactor sign when expanding the determinant along the first row.

# OpenAI completion

Sure, here's the rephrased text:

Alright, let me think. I need to figure out the probability of the observable P yielding a measurement of 0 at time t. The system is described by the state represented by the column vector (-1, 2, 1). The matrix P, along with its elements, is given to us.

I recall that the probability of obtaining a specific eigenvalue corresponds to the square of the modulus of the projection of the state vector onto its related eigenvector. Therefore, the process might include diagonalizing the matrix P to determine its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Then, I'd identify the eigenvectors that correspond to the eigenvalue 0, project the state vector onto those eigenvectors, and square the resulting magnitude to obtain the probability.

However, if the eigenvalue 0 has a multiplicity, another approach might work. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvectors without fully diagonalizing P. Let's confirm if 0 is indeed an eigenvalue by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. If λ=0 solves this, it's an eigenvalue. Let's compute det(P) when λ=0, which simplifies to det(P):

The matrix P is:
[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]

This matrix looks symmetric, indicating it's Hermitian, and that’s suitable since observables relate to Hermitian operators.

Let's expand along the first row to find the determinant:

0 * det(minor) - 1/√2 * det(minor) + 0 * det(minor) = -1/√2 * det([1/√2, 1/√2; 1/√2, 0])

Calculate the minor for the (1,2) element, with the submatrix attained by removing row 1 and column 2 being:
[1/√2, 1/√2]
[1/√2, 0]

So its determinant computes to (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = 0 - 1/2 = -1/2

Thus, det(P) is -1/√2 * (-1/2) = (1/√2)*(1/2) = 1/(2√2)

However, the determinant calculates to 1/(2√2). Det(M) is the eigenvalues' product, expected to be 1/(2√2), not zero. So 0 shouldn’t be an eigenvalue? Yet, calculating 0’s probability indicates otherwise. I might have messed up the determinant calculation.

Let me verify again. Writing out the matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Attempting determinant again, with this known symmetric matrix:

Det = 0*(det of minor) - 1/√2*(det of minor) + 0*(det of minor)

The (1,2) minor, found through removing row 1 and column 2, involves:

Rows 2, 3, columns 1, 3:

[1/√2, 1/√2]
[1/√2, 0]

determinant calculates to (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = 0 - 1/2 = -1/2

Hence, det = -1/√2 * (-1/2) = (1/√2) (1/2) = 1/(2√2). This confirms the previous positive determinant, not zero. Suggests 0 isn’t an eigenvalue. But, the task involves probability of measuring 0. This perplexes me.

Assuming an alternative strategy. Not determinant, but check if 0 is eigenvalue directly.

If λ=0, P should have a non-trivial kernel. Thus, verify if a non-zero vector satisfies P * v = 0.

Writing Pv=0:

First component: (0)(v1) + (1/√2)(v2) + 0(v3) = 0 ⇒ (1/√2)v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2)v3 = 0 ⇒ (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 ⇒ v1 + v3 = 0 ⇒ v3 = -v1.

Third component: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 ⇒ (1/√2)v2 = 0 ⇒ v2 = 0.

Thus, solutions (for eigenvectors, λ=0) satisfy v2=0, v3 = -v1. So eigenvector is in form (a, 0, -a). Yes, non-trivial solution exists. Thus, λ=0 is an eigenvalue. Then why’s determinant not zero? Must’ve been a wrong determinant computation.

If determinant’s 1/(2√2), but if 0’s an eigenvalue, this product (det) should be zero. Something’s amiss.

I clearly miscalculated determinant initially. Trying one more approach: using row operations to upper triangular form.

Original matrix:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Executing row swaps gets an upper triangular form. Swapping Row1 and Row2:

Row1: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row2: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Next, subtract Row2 from Row3:

Row3: [0 - 0, 1/√2 - 1/√2, 0 - 0] = [0, 0, 0]

Yielding this matrix:

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[0, 0, 0]

The determinant is the diagonal's products, adjusted by (-1)^k, k = rows swaps. We swapped rows once (Row1 with Row2), so det(original) is (-1) times the diagonals' product from the triangular matrix.

The product for diagonals of this triangular matrix is 1/√2 * 1/√2 * 0 = 0. Original determinant is (-1)*0 = 0. Contradicts prior result. So, one method was flawed.

Determinant changes sign on swap. Initially post swap, determinant became negative of the original. After upper triangular conversion, a 0 was on diagonal, so 1/√2 * 1/√2 * 0 = 0 determinant. Thus original should be -0 = 0. Correctness confirms mistake in the first method.

Detected misstep when expanding determinant along row 1. Expanding original determinant along this row, [0, 1/√2, 0]:

Det = 0 * minor - 1/√2 * minor + 0 * minor.

Only -1/√2 comes from (1,2)'s minor's determinant.

That minor is:

[1/√2, 1/√2]
[1/√2, 0]

Calculated as (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2 * 1/√2) = -1/2.

But cofactor sign for the (i,j) element is given by (-1)^{i+j}. Note, the sign rule for the (1,2) entry is

So term=1/√2 * (-1)*M_{1,2}\n\nM_{1,2}= det of submatrix obtained by removing row1 and column2:\n\n[1/√2, 1/√2]\n\n[1/√2, 0 ]\n\ndeterminant of that is (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2*1/√2)= -1/2\n\nThus, term is (1/√2)*(-1)*(-1/2)= (1/√2)*(1/2)= 1/(2√2)\n\nj=3: P_{1,3}=0, so term is 0.\n\nTherefore total determinant is 0 + 1/(2√2) + 0 = 1/(2√2).\n\nBut previous calculation via row operations gave determinant 0, which contradicts. Therefore, mistake must be in the row operations method? How?\n\nWait, when I swapped Row1 and Row2, then performed operations to get upper triangular, but the swap changes the determinant\'s sign. However, when swapping rows, row1 and row2, determinant becomes -det(original). Then performing row operations (subtracting row2 from row3) doesn\'t change the determinant. Then the final upper triangular matrix with a zero on the diagonal would have determinant zero. Thus, -det(original) = 0 => det(original) = 0. Hence the row operations method gives determinant 0, but expansion gives 1/(2√2). There\'s an inconsistency here.\n\nBut how come? Let me double-check my row operations.\n\nOriginal matrix:\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\n[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\nAfter swapping Row1 and Row2, new matrix:\n\n[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\nThen Row3 becomes Row3 - Row2:\n\nRow3: 0 - 0 = 0, 1/√2 - 1/√2 = 0, 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nThus, resulting in:\n\n[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0 ]\n\nSo now this is upper triangular, determinant of this is 1/√2 * 1/√2 * 0 = 0. However, determinant after swapping rows is -det(original), so det(original) = -0 = 0. So det(P) is zero. Therefore the original determinant calculation is wrong.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait Maybe my initial cofactor expansion was wrong. Because in the row operation approach, the determinant is clearly zero, so the other method must have been incorrect.\n\nWait, actually, what is the cofactor expansion? Let me do the expansion along the second row instead, as perhaps the first row has zeros.\n\nAlternative approach: Expand along the second row.\n\nRow2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]\n\nSo det(P) = 1/√2 * C21 + 0 * C22 + 1/√2 * C23\n\nFirst, compute C21: (-1)^{2+1} * M21 = -1 * det of minor M21.\n\nMinor M21 is obtained by removing row2 and column1:\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\n[0, 1/√2, 0]\n\nThis is a 2x3 matrix? Wait, no, the minor should be a 2x2 matrix. Removing row2 and column1, we have rows 1 and 3, columns 2 and 3:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow1: 0, 1/√2, 0\n\nRow3: 0, 1/√2, 0\n\nSo removing column1, we have:\n\nRow1: 1/√2, 0\n\nRow3: 1/√2, 0\n\nTherefore, minor M21 is the determinant:\n\n(1/√2 * 0) - (0 * 1/√2) = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nThus, C21 = -1 * 0 = 0\n\nNext, C23 is (-1)^{2+3} * M23 = (-1)^5 * M23 = -1 * M23\n\nMinor M23 is obtained by removing row2 and column3:\n\nRow1: 0, 1/√2, 0 -> columns 1 and 2: 0, 1/√2\n\nRow3: 0, 1/√2, 0 -> columns 1 and 2: 0, 1/√2\n\nThus, minor M23 is determinant of:\n\n[0, 1/√2]\n\n[0, 1/√2]\n\nWhich is (0*1/√2) - (1/√2*0) = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nThus, C23 = -1 * 0 = 0\n\nTherefore, det(P) = 1/√2 * 0 + 0 + 1/√2 * 0 = 0\n\nSo expanding along the second row gives determinant 0, which matches the row operation method.\n\nTherefore, the earlier calculation along the first row was incorrect, I must have had a mistake there.\n\nAh! I see. When I expanded along the first row, I think I forgot to consider that the cofactor expansion includes the signs.\n\nWait, let me recap.\n\nOriginal expansion:\n\ndet(P) = 0*C11 + (1/√2)*C12 + 0*C13\n\nC12 is (-1)^{1+2} * M12 = (-1)^3 * M12 = - M12\n\nWhich we computed as -(-1/2) = 1/2? Wait no.\n\nWait, first, M12 determinant was computed as -1/2.\n\nThen, C12 = (-1)^{3} * (-1/2) = -1 * (-1/2) = 1/2\n\nTherefore, det(P) = (1/√2)*(1/2) = 1/(2√2). But expanding along the second row gave zero, which must be correct?\n\nHmmm, this is contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the column operation method is wrong? But the swap changed the determinant appropriately. Wait maybe if the determinant depends on the method but the operators resulted in multiple swaps? Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nBut if the determinant is 0 according to two different methods (row operations and cofactor expansion along the second row), but cofactor expansion along the first row gives 1/(2√2), which contradicts. Hence need to figure out the mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe wrong computation of minor M12. Let me check.\n\nWhen expanding along the first row, entry (1,2) is 1/√2, so the minor M12 is the determinant of the submatrix after removing row1 and column2. The original matrix is:\n\nRow1: 0, 1/√2, 0\n\nRow2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2\n\nRow3: 0, 1/√2, 0\n\nRemoving row1 and column2, we get the submatrix:\n\nRow2: 1/√2, 1/√2\n\nRow3: 0, 0\n\nThis submatrix is:\n\n[1/√2, 1/√2]\n\n[0,       0 ]\n\nTherefore, determinant is (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(0) = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nWait, what? So the minor M12 is zero. Thus, the cofactor C12 is (-1)^{1+2} * 0 = (-1)^3 *0 = -0=0.\n\nTherefore, det(P) = 0*C11 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*C13 = 0.\n\nTherefore, expanding along the first row, correctly this time, we also get determinant 0.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong before? Previously, I thought the submatrix for M12 was:\n\n[1/√2, 1/√2]\n\n[1/√2, 0 ]\n\nBut that\'s incorrect.\n\nWait, when we remove row1 and column2, original columns are:\n\nOriginal columns are col1: 0,1/√2,0; col2:1/√2,0,1/√2; col3:0,1/√2,0.\n\nRemoving column2, we\'re left with col1 and col3:\n\nSo row2 and row3 (since row1 is removed) of columns1 and3:\n\nRow2: 1/√2 (col1), 1/√2 (col3)\n\nRow3: 0 (col1), 0 (col3)\n\nThus, minor M12 is:\n\n[1/√2, 1/√2]\n\n[0,       0 ]\n\nWhich has determinant 0, not -1/2.\n\nTherefore, my previous calculation was incorrect. Therefore, det(P) is indeed 0 when expanding along the first row as well.\n\nTherefore, correct. Then why did I get -1/2 before? Because I think I considered column2 and column3. Wait, when column2 is removed in the original matrix, perhaps the columns are shifted? Let me re-express the original matrix:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1: 0,1/√2,0\n\nColumn2:1/√2,0,1/√2\n\nColumn3:0,1/√2,0\n\nSo removing column2 leaves us with column1 and column3:\n\nRow2 of columns1 and3: 1/√2 and1/√2\n\nRow3 of columns1 and3:0 and0\n\nSo entries are:\n\nRow2:1/√2,1/√2\n\nRow3:0,0\n\nWhich is as above.\n\nTherefore, previous mistake was choosing the wrong submatrix. Hence expanding along first row gives det=0. So determinant is indeed 0 and hence 0 is an eigenvalue. So maybe the multiplicity is relevant. So based on the equation before, rank of matrix P?\n\nLet me check rank. If determinant is 0, then the matrix is singular. The kernel has dimension at least 1. Earlier solutions suggest that the eigenvectors for 0 eigenvalue are (a,0,-a). So dimension 1. Then the other eigenvalues must be non-zero.\n\nTo find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the projection of the state onto the eigenvector(s) associated with 0 eigenvalue. Then the probability is the squared norm of that projection.\n\nGiven the state vector is (-1, 2, 1). So the current state is a vector in C^3: (-1,2,1). We need to project this onto the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0.\n\nEarlier, eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (a,0,-a). So to find an orthonormal basis (if needed), but since it\'s a 1-dimensional eigenspace (since geometric multiplicity equals algebraic multiplicity for Hermitian matrices, but since P is 3x3 and trace?\n\nWait, perhaps let\'s calculate trace(P). Trace is sum of diagonals. 0 + 0 + 0 =0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0. Since determinant is 0, then product of eigenvalues is 0. So Let eigenvalues be λ1, λ2, λ3. Then λ1 + λ2 + λ3=0, and λ1 λ2 λ3=0. Hence, at least one eigenvalue is 0. Since the kernel is 1-dimensional, geometric multiplicity 1, then algebraic multiplicity is also 1 (since Hermitian matrices are diagonalizable). So other eigenvalues are non-zero, say λ and -λ, so that their sum is zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let\'s compute the eigenvalues explicitly. Let\'s solve the eigenvalue equation: det(P - λ I)=0.\n\nMatrix P - λ I:\n\n[-λ, 1/√2, 0]\n\n[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]\n\n[0, 1/√2, -λ]\n\nSo set det=0.\n\nCalculate determinant:\n\ndet(P - λ I) = -λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2)*[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0*[ ... ]\n\nWait, expanding along first row.\n\ndet = (-λ) * [λ^2 - (1/2)] - (1/√2)* [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] + 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2 ) - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 )\n\n= -λ^3 + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2\n\n= -λ^3 + λ = -λ (λ^2 - 1)\n\nSet equal to 0:\n\n-λ (λ^2 -1) = 0 ⇒ λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1\n\nWait, so eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. The sum is 0+1+(-1)=0, as needed. The product is 0.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.\n\nSo now the probability of getting 0 is the square of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.\n\nEarlier found that eigenvectors for λ=0 are spanned by (a, 0, -a). Let\'s normalize this vector. Take a=1, then (1,0,-1). The norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2)=sqrt(2). Thus, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).\n\nTherefore, to find the probability, need to compute the inner product of the state vector (-1,2,1) with the eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), then take the squared magnitude.\n\nCompute the inner product:\n\n(-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 +1*(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 -1/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2.\n\nThen the squared magnitude is | -√2 |^2 = (√2)^2 = 2. Wait, but probability can\'t exceed 1. Hmm, this is a problem. Hence, must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps there\'s a mistake in the eigenvector normalization or the projection.\n\nWait, first, let\'s check whether (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. Apply P to it:\n\nP * (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T\n\nFirst component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) =0\n\nSecond component: (1/√2)*(1/√2) +0 *0 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) = (1/2) + (-1/2) =0\n\nThird component:0*(1/√2)+(1/√2)*0 +0*(-1/√2)=0. Thus, we get (0,0,0), which is correct. Therefore, this is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.\n\nTherefore, projection is calculated as inner product with this vector. However, resulting in a squared magnitude of 2, which is not possible.\n\nWait, I must have messed up the inner product.\n\nWait, original state is (-1,2,1). Let\'s compute the inner product with the eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2):\n\nThus,\n\n⟨ eigen | state ⟩ = (1/√2)* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2 -1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2\n\nYes, that\'s correct. So amplitude is -√2, then the probability is | -√2 |^2 = 2. But how? Probability can\'t exceed 1. Therefore, error must lie in assuming that the eigenvector is normalized? Wait, we checked the norm of eigenvector (1/√2,0,-1/√2) is  sqrt( (1/2) +0 + (1/2) )=sqrt(1)=1, so it is normalized.\n\nThen problem is if the state (-1,2,1) itself is normalized? Wait, does the state vector need to be normalized?\n\nIn quantum mechanics, states are represented by normalized vectors. However, the given state is a column matrix with elements (-1,2,1). If this is not normalized, the probabilities might not sum to 1. Presumably, we need to first normalize the state vector before calculating probabilities.\n\nBut the problem says "the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix...", so we have to check if this vector is normalized. Let\'s check: norm squared is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2=1+4+1=6. Thus, the state vector is not normalized. In quantum mechanics, the state vectors are normalized to 1, so we need to normalize the given vector before computing probabilities.\n\nSo original state: (-1,2,1), let\'s normalize it. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state vector is (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6).\n\nTherefore, the projection onto the eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) is:\n\n(−1/√6)(1/√2) + (2/√6)(0) + (1/√6)(−1/√2) = [ -1/(√6√2) -1/(√6√2) ] = (-2)/(√12 ) = (-2)/(2√3) ) = -1/√3.\n\nThe square of this magnitude is | -1/√3 |^2 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333...\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/3.\n\nHence, the answer is 1/3.\n\nBut let me check this.\n\nPreviously, without normalizing the state, the projection was giving probability 2, but since the unnormalized state has norm squared 6, the actual probability would be |⟨ eigen | state⟩|^2 / ||state||^2. So if originally |⟨eigen|state〉|^2 is 2, then divided by 6 gives 2/6=1/3. So matched. Thus, key point here is the state must be normalized.\n\nSince in the problem statement, we are to assume that the state is given as a vector, but unless it\'s specified as normalized, perhaps is that the case? Wait, in physics problems, the state is generally assumed to be normalized unless stated otherwise. However, in this problem, the given vector (-1,2,1) has a squared norm of 6, which is not 1. Thus, the question is, does the problem consider the vector to be already normalized or not?\n\nRe-reading the problem: "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)." There\'s no mention of normalization. Therefore, perhaps we can proceed in two ways:\n\nEither assume it\'s already normalized (unlikely, as the norm is sqrt(6)), or normalize it first then compute probabilities, as in quantum mechanics probabilities require normalized states.\n\nGiven the standard QM formalism, likely it is expected to normalize the state first. Therefore, our earlier calculation is correct, probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but the other eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Let me check if the total probability sums to 1 if we include all three eigenvalues.\n\nComputing probabilities for eigenvalues 1 and -1.\n\nFirst, eigenvectors for λ=1. Solve (P - I)v=0.\n\nBut stepping back, maybe the correct way is:\n\nNormalized state vector is |ψ> = (-1,2,1)/√6.\n\nEigenvectors for P: λ=0 is (1/√2,0,-1/√2), λ=1 and λ=-1 also have eigenvectors. Let\'s check if they form an orthonormal basis.\n\nFind eigenvectors for eigenvalues 1 and -1.\n\nFirst, eigenvector for λ=1: solve (P - I)v =0.\n\nMatrix P - I:\n\n[-1, 1/√2, 0]\n\n[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]\n\n[0, 1/√2, -1]\n\nSet up equations:\n\nFirst component: -1*v1 + (1/√2)v2 =0\n\nSecond component: (1/√2)v1 -1*v2 + (1/√2)v3=0\n\nThird component: (1/√2)v2 -1*v3=0\n\nFrom the first equation: -v1 + (1/√2)v2 =0 ⇒ v1 = (1/√2)v2\n\nThird equation: (1/√2)v2 -v3=0 ⇒ v3 = (1/√2)v2\n\nLet’s set v2 =√2 (to simplify). Then v1=(1/√2)*√2=1, v3=(1/√2)*√2=1.\n\nThus, the eigenvector is (1, √2,1). Let\'s check normalization:\n\nNorm squared: 1^2 + (√2)^2 +1^2=1+2+1=4. Thus, normalize by dividing by 2.\n\nSo normalized eigenvector: (1/2, √2/2, 1/2)\n\nCheck if this is eigenvector:\n\nP matrix times the vector:\n\nFirst component: 0*1/2 + (1/√2)*(√2/2) +0*1/2= (1/√2)*(√2/2)= (1/2)\n\nBut eigenvalue is 1, so component should be 1*(1/2). Instead, you get 1/2. Hmm, but component wouldn\'t necessarily be the eigenvalue times the component. Wait, actually:\n\nApply P to eigenvector (1/2, √2/2, 1/2):\n\nFirst component: 0*(1/2) + (1/√2)*(√2/2) +0*(1/2)= (1/√2)(√2/2)=1/2, which is 1 * 1/2. Correct.\n\nSecond component: (1/√2)*(1/2) +0*(√2/2) + (1/√2)*(1/2)= (1/√2)*(1/2 +1/2)=1/√2. However, eigenvector component is √2/2, multiplied by eigenvalue 1: √2/2 ≈0.707, but 1/√2≈0.707. Indeed, same value. Hence, ok.\n\nThird component: same as first. So this seems to check out. Therefore eigenvector for λ=1 is (1/2, √2/2, 1/2)\n\nSimilarly, eigenvector for λ= -1.\n\nSolve (P + I)v=0.\n\nMatrix P + I:\n\n[1, 1/√2, 0]\n\n[1/√2,1,1/√2]\n\n[0,1/√2,1]\n\nEquations:\n\nFirst:1*v1 + (1/√2)v2=0\n\nSecond: (1/√2)v1 +1*v2 + (1/√2)v3=0\n\nThird: (1/√2)v2 +1*v3=0\n\nFrom third equation: v3 = - (1/√2)v2\n\nFrom first equation: v1= - (1/√2)v2\n\nLet v2= √2; then v1=-1, v3=-1\n\nEigenvector: (-1, √2, -1). Norm squared:1+2+1=4. Normalized: (-1/2, √2/2, -1/2)\n\nCheck:\n\nP * (-1/2, √2/2, -1/2):\n\nFirst component: 0*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*(√2/2) +0*(-1/2)= (1/2). Eigenvalue -1, so should be -1*(-1/2)= 1/2. So correct.\n\nSecond component: (1/√2)*(-1/2)+0*(√2/2)+ (1/√2)*(-1/2)= (1/√2)(-1/2 -1/2)= -1/√2. Eigenvalue -1 times eigenvector second component: (-1)*(√2/2)= -√2/2 ≈-0.707. But here, you have -1/√2≈-0.707 as well, which is the same. Correct.\n\nThird component: Same as first, multiplied by eigenvalue. Correct. Thus, eigenvector is correct.\n\nTherefore, now the three eigenvectors are mutually orthonormal:\n\nv0 = (1/√2,0,-1/√2)\n\nv1=(1/2, √2/2,1/2)\n\nv-1=(-1/2, √2/2,-1/2)\n\nThus, the state vector ψ is decomposed as their linear combination.\n\nCompute inner product of ψ with v0: ⟨v0|ψ⟩.\n\nWhere ψ is (-1,2,1)/√6\n\nSo:\n\n⟨v0 | ψ⟩ = (1/√2)*(-1/√6) +0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)*(1/√6)\n\n= (-1/(√2√6) -1/(√2√6)) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3\n\nAs before. Hence probability | -1/√3 |²=1/3.\n\nSimilarly, the total probabilities sum:\n\nPr(0)=1/3\n\nPr(1)=|⟨v1|ψ⟩|² and |⟨v-1|ψ⟩|².\n\nCompute these as well for sanity check.\n\nCompute ⟨v1|ψ⟩:\n\n(1/2)*(-1/√6) + (√2/2)*(2/√6)+(1/2)*(1/√6).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst: (-1)/(2√6)\n\nSecond: (√2/2)*(2/√6) = (√2 *2)/(2√6)= √2/√6=1/√3\n\nThird:1/(2√6)\n\nHence total: [ -1/(2√6) +1/(2√6) ] +1/√3=0 +1/√3. Therefore, amplitude is1/√3, hence probability 1/3.\n\nSimilarly for ⟨v-1|ψ⟩:\n\n(-1/2)*(-1/√6)+(√2/2)*(2/√6)+ (-1/2)*(1/√6)\n\nFirst term: (1)/(2√6)\n\nSecond: same as before, (√2 *2)/(2√6)=1/√3\n\nThird term: (-1)/(2√6)\n\nTotal: [1/(2√6) -1/(2√6)] +1/√3=0 +1/√3. Amplitude 1/√3, probability1/3.\n\nTherefore sum of probabilities is 1/3 +1/3 +1/3=1. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting 0 is 1/3.\n\nYes, the thought process includes an error in the initial calculation due to missubmatrix selection, not normalizing the state, then correcting by normalization, and finally getting the right probability. Thanks to rechecking, double checking, and ensuring normalization was accounted for. Thus, the probability is 1/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743848470, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6895, prompt_tokens=2182, total_tokens=9077, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To calculate the probability of measuring the eigenvalue 0 for the observable \( P \) at time \( t \), we follow these steps:

1. **Verify the Eigenvalue 0**:
   - The matrix \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Solving \( Pv = 0 \) reveals that the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 are of the form \( (a, 0, -a) \).

2. **Normalize the Eigenvector**:
   - The eigenvector \( (a, 0, -a) \) is normalized to \( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \).

3. **Normalize the State Vector**:
   - The given state vector is \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The norm of this vector is \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state vector is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).

4. **Compute the Inner Product**:
   - The inner product of the normalized state vector with the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is:
     \[
     \left\langle \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Probability**:
   - The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product:
     \[
     \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

The probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time \( t \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

 (-1)^{1+2} = -1. Therefore, the cofactor is (-1) * minor determinant.

Wait, in the determinant expansion formula, det(A) = Σ_{j=1}^n A_{i,j} * C_{i,j} where C_{i,j} is the cofactor, which is (-1)^{i+j} * M_{i,j} (minor). Therefore, for expanding along the first row:

det(P) = Σ_{j=1}^3 P_{1,j} * (-1)^{1+j} * M_{1,j}

So for j=1: P_{1,1}=0, so term is 0.

j=2: P_{1,2}=1/√2, cofactor is (-1)^{1+2} * M_{1,2} = -1*M_{1,2}. So term=1/√2 * (-1)*M_{1,2}

M_{1,2}= det of submatrix obtained by removing row1 and column2:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[1/√2, 0 ]

determinant of that is (1/√2 * 0) - (1/√2*1/√2)= -1/2

Thus, term is (1/√2)*(-1)*(-1/2)= (1/√2)*(1/2)= 1/(2√2)

j=3: P_{1,3}=0, so term is 0.

Therefore total determinant is 0 + 1/(2√2) + 0 = 1/(2√2).

But previous calculation via row operations gave determinant 0, which contradicts. Therefore, mistake must be in the row operations method? How?

Wait, when I swapped Row1 and Row2, then performed operations to get upper triangular, but the swap changes the determinant's sign. However, when swapping rows, row1 and row2, determinant becomes -det(original). Then performing row operations (subtracting row2 from row3) doesn't change the determinant. Then the final upper triangular matrix with a zero on the diagonal would have determinant zero. Thus, -det(original) = 0 => det(original) = 0. Hence the row operations method gives determinant 0, but expansion gives 1/(2√2). There's an inconsistency here.

But how come? Let me double-check my row operations.

Original matrix:

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

After swapping Row1 and Row2, new matrix:

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

Then Row3 becomes Row3 - Row2:

Row3: 0 - 0 = 0, 1/√2 - 1/√2 = 0, 0 - 0 = 0.

Thus, resulting in:

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[0, 0, 0 ]

So now this is upper triangular, determinant of this is 1/√2 * 1/√2 * 0 = 0. However, determinant after swapping rows is -det(original), so det(original) = -0 = 0. So det(P) is zero. Therefore the original determinant calculation is wrong.

But how?

Wait Maybe my initial cofactor expansion was wrong. Because in the row operation approach, the determinant is clearly zero, so the other method must have been incorrect.

Wait, actually, what is the cofactor expansion? Let me do the expansion along the second row instead, as perhaps the first row has zeros.

Alternative approach: Expand along the second row.

Row2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

So det(P) = 1/√2 * C21 + 0 * C22 + 1/√2 * C23

First, compute C21: (-1)^{2+1} * M21 = -1 * det of minor M21.

Minor M21 is obtained by removing row2 and column1:

[0, 1/√2, 0]

[0, 1/√2, 0]

This is a 2x3 matrix? Wait, no, the minor should be a 2x2 matrix. Removing row2 and column1, we have rows 1 and 3, columns 2 and 3:

Original rows:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

So removing column1, we have:

Row1: 1/√2, 0

Row3: 1/√2, 0

Therefore, minor M21 is the determinant:

(1/√2 * 0) - (0 * 1/√2) = 0 - 0 = 0

Thus, C21 = -1 * 0 = 0

Next, C23 is (-1)^{2+3} * M23 = (-1)^5 * M23 = -1 * M23

Minor M23 is obtained by removing row2 and column3:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0 -> columns 1 and 2: 0, 1/√2

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0 -> columns 1 and 2: 0, 1/√2

Thus, minor M23 is determinant of:

[0, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2]

Which is (0*1/√2) - (1/√2*0) = 0 - 0 = 0

Thus, C23 = -1 * 0 = 0

Therefore, det(P) = 1/√2 * 0 + 0 + 1/√2 * 0 = 0

So expanding along the second row gives determinant 0, which matches the row operation method.

Therefore, the earlier calculation along the first row was incorrect, I must have had a mistake there.

Ah! I see. When I expanded along the first row, I think I forgot to consider that the cofactor expansion includes the signs.

Wait, let me recap.

Original expansion:

det(P) = 0*C11 + (1/√2)*C12 + 0*C13

C12 is (-1)^{1+2} * M12 = (-1)^3 * M12 = - M12

Which we computed as -(-1/2) = 1/2? Wait no.

Wait, first, M12 determinant was computed as -1/2.

Then, C12 = (-1)^{3} * (-1/2) = -1 * (-1/2) = 1/2

Therefore, det(P) = (1/√2)*(1/2) = 1/(2√2). But expanding along the second row gave zero, which must be correct?

Hmmm, this is contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the column operation method is wrong? But the swap changed the determinant appropriately. Wait maybe if the determinant depends on the method but the operators resulted in multiple swaps? Wait, no. Let me look again.

But if the determinant is 0 according to two different methods (row operations and cofactor expansion along the second row), but cofactor expansion along the first row gives 1/(2√2), which contradicts. Hence need to figure out the mistake here.

Wait, maybe wrong computation of minor M12. Let me check.

When expanding along the first row, entry (1,2) is 1/√2, so the minor M12 is the determinant of the submatrix after removing row1 and column2. The original matrix is:

Row1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Removing row1 and column2, we get the submatrix:

Row2: 1/√2, 1/√2

Row3: 0, 0

This submatrix is:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[0,       0 ]

Therefore, determinant is (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(0) = 0 - 0 = 0.

Wait, what? So the minor M12 is zero. Thus, the cofactor C12 is (-1)^{1+2} * 0 = (-1)^3 *0 = -0=0.

Therefore, det(P) = 0*C11 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*C13 = 0.

Therefore, expanding along the first row, correctly this time, we also get determinant 0.

Wait, so where did I go wrong before? Previously, I thought the submatrix for M12 was:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[1/√2, 0 ]

But that's incorrect.

Wait, when we remove row1 and column2, original columns are:

Original columns are col1: 0,1/√2,0; col2:1/√2,0,1/√2; col3:0,1/√2,0.

Removing column2, we're left with col1 and col3:

So row2 and row3 (since row1 is removed) of columns1 and3:

Row2: 1/√2 (col1), 1/√2 (col3)

Row3: 0 (col1), 0 (col3)

Thus, minor M12 is:

[1/√2, 1/√2]

[0,       0 ]

Which has determinant 0, not -1/2.

Therefore, my previous calculation was incorrect. Therefore, det(P) is indeed 0 when expanding along the first row as well.

Therefore, correct. Then why did I get -1/2 before? Because I think I considered column2 and column3. Wait, when column2 is removed in the original matrix, perhaps the columns are shifted? Let me re-express the original matrix:

Columns:

Column1: 0,1/√2,0

Column2:1/√2,0,1/√2

Column3:0,1/√2,0

So removing column2 leaves us with column1 and column3:

Row2 of columns1 and3: 1/√2 and1/√2

Row3 of columns1 and3:0 and0

So entries are:

Row2:1/√2,1/√2

Row3:0,0

Which is as above.

Therefore, previous mistake was choosing the wrong submatrix. Hence expanding along first row gives det=0. So determinant is indeed 0 and hence 0 is an eigenvalue. So maybe the multiplicity is relevant. So based on the equation before, rank of matrix P?

Let me check rank. If determinant is 0, then the matrix is singular. The kernel has dimension at least 1. Earlier solutions suggest that the eigenvectors for 0 eigenvalue are (a,0,-a). So dimension 1. Then the other eigenvalues must be non-zero.

To find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the projection of the state onto the eigenvector(s) associated with 0 eigenvalue. Then the probability is the squared norm of that projection.

Given the state vector is (-1, 2, 1). So the current state is a vector in C^3: (-1,2,1). We need to project this onto the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0.

Earlier, eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form (a,0,-a). So to find an orthonormal basis (if needed), but since it's a 1-dimensional eigenspace (since geometric multiplicity equals algebraic multiplicity for Hermitian matrices, but since P is 3x3 and trace?

Wait, perhaps let's calculate trace(P). Trace is sum of diagonals. 0 + 0 + 0 =0. So the sum of eigenvalues is 0. Since determinant is 0, then product of eigenvalues is 0. So Let eigenvalues be λ1, λ2, λ3. Then λ1 + λ2 + λ3=0, and λ1 λ2 λ3=0. Hence, at least one eigenvalue is 0. Since the kernel is 1-dimensional, geometric multiplicity 1, then algebraic multiplicity is also 1 (since Hermitian matrices are diagonalizable). So other eigenvalues are non-zero, say λ and -λ, so that their sum is zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps let's compute the eigenvalues explicitly. Let's solve the eigenvalue equation: det(P - λ I)=0.

Matrix P - λ I:

[-λ, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, -λ]

So set det=0.

Calculate determinant:

det(P - λ I) = -λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] - (1/√2)*[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0*[ ... ]

Wait, expanding along first row.

det = (-λ) * [λ^2 - (1/2)] - (1/√2)* [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] + 0

Simplify:

= (-λ)(λ^2 - 1/2 ) - (1/√2)( -λ/√2 )

= -λ^3 + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2

= -λ^3 + λ = -λ (λ^2 - 1)

Set equal to 0:

-λ (λ^2 -1) = 0 ⇒ λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1

Wait, so eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1. The sum is 0+1+(-1)=0, as needed. The product is 0.

Therefore, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

So now the probability of getting 0 is the square of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

Earlier found that eigenvectors for λ=0 are spanned by (a, 0, -a). Let's normalize this vector. Take a=1, then (1,0,-1). The norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2)=sqrt(2). Thus, the normalized eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2).

Therefore, to find the probability, need to compute the inner product of the state vector (-1,2,1) with the eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2), then take the squared magnitude.

Compute the inner product:

(-1)(1/√2) + 2*0 +1*(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + 0 -1/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2.

Then the squared magnitude is | -√2 |^2 = (√2)^2 = 2. Wait, but probability can't exceed 1. Hmm, this is a problem. Hence, must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the eigenvector normalization or the projection.

Wait, first, let's check whether (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. Apply P to it:

P * (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T

First component: 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1/√2) =0

Second component: (1/√2)*(1/√2) +0 *0 + (1/√2)*(-1/√2) = (1/2) + (-1/2) =0

Third component:0*(1/√2)+(1/√2)*0 +0*(-1/√2)=0. Thus, we get (0,0,0), which is correct. Therefore, this is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Therefore, projection is calculated as inner product with this vector. However, resulting in a squared magnitude of 2, which is not possible.

Wait, I must have messed up the inner product.

Wait, original state is (-1,2,1). Let's compute the inner product with the eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2):

Thus,

⟨ eigen | state ⟩ = (1/√2)* (-1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)*1 = (-1/√2 -1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2

Yes, that's correct. So amplitude is -√2, then the probability is | -√2 |^2 = 2. But how? Probability can't exceed 1. Therefore, error must lie in assuming that the eigenvector is normalized? Wait, we checked the norm of eigenvector (1/√2,0,-1/√2) is  sqrt( (1/2) +0 + (1/2) )=sqrt(1)=1, so it is normalized.

Then problem is if the state (-1,2,1) itself is normalized? Wait, does the state vector need to be normalized?

In quantum mechanics, states are represented by normalized vectors. However, the given state is a column matrix with elements (-1,2,1). If this is not normalized, the probabilities might not sum to 1. Presumably, we need to first normalize the state vector before calculating probabilities.

But the problem says "the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix...", so we have to check if this vector is normalized. Let's check: norm squared is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2=1+4+1=6. Thus, the state vector is not normalized. In quantum mechanics, the state vectors are normalized to 1, so we need to normalize the given vector before computing probabilities.

So original state: (-1,2,1), let's normalize it. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state vector is (-1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6).

Therefore, the projection onto the eigenvector (1/√2, 0, -1/√2) is:

(−1/√6)(1/√2) + (2/√6)(0) + (1/√6)(−1/√2) = [ -1/(√6√2) -1/(√6√2) ] = (-2)/(√12 ) = (-2)/(2√3) ) = -1/√3.

The square of this magnitude is | -1/√3 |^2 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333...

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Hence, the answer is 1/3.

But let me check this.

Previously, without normalizing the state, the projection was giving probability 2, but since the unnormalized state has norm squared 6, the actual probability would be |⟨ eigen | state⟩|^2 / ||state||^2. So if originally |⟨eigen|state〉|^2 is 2, then divided by 6 gives 2/6=1/3. So matched. Thus, key point here is the state must be normalized.

Since in the problem statement, we are to assume that the state is given as a vector, but unless it's specified as normalized, perhaps is that the case? Wait, in physics problems, the state is generally assumed to be normalized unless stated otherwise. However, in this problem, the given vector (-1,2,1) has a squared norm of 6, which is not 1. Thus, the question is, does the problem consider the vector to be already normalized or not?

Re-reading the problem: "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)." There's no mention of normalization. Therefore, perhaps we can proceed in two ways:

Either assume it's already normalized (unlikely, as the norm is sqrt(6)), or normalize it first then compute probabilities, as in quantum mechanics probabilities require normalized states.

Given the standard QM formalism, likely it is expected to normalize the state first. Therefore, our earlier calculation is correct, probability is 1/3.

Wait, but the other eigenvalues are +1 and -1. Let me check if the total probability sums to 1 if we include all three eigenvalues.

Computing probabilities for eigenvalues 1 and -1.

First, eigenvectors for λ=1. Solve (P - I)v=0.

But stepping back, maybe the correct way is:

Normalized state vector is |ψ> = (-1,2,1)/√6.

Eigenvectors for P: λ=0 is (1/√2,0,-1/√2), λ=1 and λ=-1 also have eigenvectors. Let's check if they form an orthonormal basis.

Find eigenvectors for eigenvalues 1 and -1.

First, eigenvector for λ=1: solve (P - I)v =0.

Matrix P - I:

[-1, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2, -1, 1/√2]

[0, 1/√2, -1]

Set up equations:

First component: -1*v1 + (1/√2)v2 =0

Second component: (1/√2)v1 -1*v2 + (1/√2)v3=0

Third component: (1/√2)v2 -1*v3=0

From the first equation: -v1 + (1/√2)v2 =0 ⇒ v1 = (1/√2)v2

Third equation: (1/√2)v2 -v3=0 ⇒ v3 = (1/√2)v2

Let’s set v2 =√2 (to simplify). Then v1=(1/√2)*√2=1, v3=(1/√2)*√2=1.

Thus, the eigenvector is (1, √2,1). Let's check normalization:

Norm squared: 1^2 + (√2)^2 +1^2=1+2+1=4. Thus, normalize by dividing by 2.

So normalized eigenvector: (1/2, √2/2, 1/2)

Check if this is eigenvector:

P matrix times the vector:

First component: 0*1/2 + (1/√2)*(√2/2) +0*1/2= (1/√2)*(√2/2)= (1/2)

But eigenvalue is 1, so component should be 1*(1/2). Instead, you get 1/2. Hmm, but component wouldn't necessarily be the eigenvalue times the component. Wait, actually:

Apply P to eigenvector (1/2, √2/2, 1/2):

First component: 0*(1/2) + (1/√2)*(√2/2) +0*(1/2)= (1/√2)(√2/2)=1/2, which is 1 * 1/2. Correct.

Second component: (1/√2)*(1/2) +0*(√2/2) + (1/√2)*(1/2)= (1/√2)*(1/2 +1/2)=1/√2. However, eigenvector component is √2/2, multiplied by eigenvalue 1: √2/2 ≈0.707, but 1/√2≈0.707. Indeed, same value. Hence, ok.

Third component: same as first. So this seems to check out. Therefore eigenvector for λ=1 is (1/2, √2/2, 1/2)

Similarly, eigenvector for λ= -1.

Solve (P + I)v=0.

Matrix P + I:

[1, 1/√2, 0]

[1/√2,1,1/√2]

[0,1/√2,1]

Equations:

First:1*v1 + (1/√2)v2=0

Second: (1/√2)v1 +1*v2 + (1/√2)v3=0

Third: (1/√2)v2 +1*v3=0

From third equation: v3 = - (1/√2)v2

From first equation: v1= - (1/√2)v2

Let v2= √2; then v1=-1, v3=-1

Eigenvector: (-1, √2, -1). Norm squared:1+2+1=4. Normalized: (-1/2, √2/2, -1/2)

Check:

P * (-1/2, √2/2, -1/2):

First component: 0*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*(√2/2) +0*(-1/2)= (1/2). Eigenvalue -1, so should be -1*(-1/2)= 1/2. So correct.

Second component: (1/√2)*(-1/2)+0*(√2/2)+ (1/√2)*(-1/2)= (1/√2)(-1/2 -1/2)= -1/√2. Eigenvalue -1 times eigenvector second component: (-1)*(√2/2)= -√2/2 ≈-0.707. But here, you have -1/√2≈-0.707 as well, which is the same. Correct.

Third component: Same as first, multiplied by eigenvalue. Correct. Thus, eigenvector is correct.

Therefore, now the three eigenvectors are mutually orthonormal:

v0 = (1/√2,0,-1/√2)

v1=(1/2, √2/2,1/2)

v-1=(-1/2, √2/2,-1/2)

Thus, the state vector ψ is decomposed as their linear combination.

Compute inner product of ψ with v0: ⟨v0|ψ⟩.

Where ψ is (-1,2,1)/√6

So:

⟨v0 | ψ⟩ = (1/√2)*(-1/√6) +0*(2/√6) + (-1/√2)*(1/√6)

= (-1/(√2√6) -1/(√2√6)) = (-2)/(√12) = (-2)/(2√3) = -1/√3

As before. Hence probability | -1/√3 |²=1/3.

Similarly, the total probabilities sum:

Pr(0)=1/3

Pr(1)=|⟨v1|ψ⟩|² and |⟨v-1|ψ⟩|².

Compute these as well for sanity check.

Compute ⟨v1|ψ⟩:

(1/2)*(-1/√6) + (√2/2)*(2/√6)+(1/2)*(1/√6).

Compute each term:

First: (-1)/(2√6)

Second: (√2/2)*(2/√6) = (√2 *2)/(2√6)= √2/√6=1/√3

Third:1/(2√6)

Hence total: [ -1/(2√6) +1/(2√6) ] +1/√3=0 +1/√3. Therefore, amplitude is1/√3, hence probability 1/3.

Similarly for ⟨v-1|ψ⟩:

(-1/2)*(-1/√6)+(√2/2)*(2/√6)+ (-1/2)*(1/√6)

First term: (1)/(2√6)

Second: same as before, (√2 *2)/(2√6)=1/√3

Third term: (-1)/(2√6)

Total: [1/(2√6) -1/(2√6)] +1/√3=0 +1/√3. Amplitude 1/√3, probability1/3.

Therefore sum of probabilities is 1/3 +1/3 +1/3=1. Correct.

Therefore, the probability of getting 0 is 1/3.

Yes, the thought process includes an error in the initial calculation due to missubmatrix selection, not normalizing the state, then correcting by normalization, and finally getting the right probability. Thanks to rechecking, double checking, and ensuring normalization was accounted for. Thus, the probability is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.

But in our eigenvector calculation, we found that a non-zero vector (a,0,-a) satisfies Pv=0. Hence, determinant must be zero, confirming 0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nHence, earlier my determinant must have been erroneously calculated. Therefore, 0 is an eigenvalue.\n\nSo, since zero is an eigenvalue, and the eigenvectors are of the form (a,0,-a).\n\nWe can take a specific eigenvector, say (1,0,-1). Then we need to normalize the state vector if necessary, but I think the given state is normalized. Wait, the given state is (-1,2,1). Let\'s check if it\'s normalized. Norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the state vector is not normalized. Wait, does that matter? In Quantum Mechanics, states are usually normalized, so perhaps the problem is implicitly assuming normalized vectors? Wait, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)" but operator P is given. If the state vector is not given as normalized, when we calculate probabilities, we should use the state vector normalized. So perhaps we need to normalize the state first.\n\nWait, the problem says "the state of a system... is given by the column matrix," which could imply that vectors are represented as they are. However, in Quantum Mechanics, the probability depends on the squared amplitude of the projection, regardless of the normalization of the original vector, as the probabilities are normalized by the norm squared of the state vector. Wait, when computing probabilities, even if the total vector is not normalized, the probabilities are the squared modulus of the projections divided by the squared norm of the entire vector. Because suppose |ψ> is given, then the probability is |<eigenvector|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>.\n\nWait, let me think. If the actual state vector is |ψ> with components (-1,2,1). Then the norm squared is 1 +4+1 =6. However, usually states are normalized to 1, but perhaps the state as given is not. The standard formula for probability is, for eigenvalue λ, to sum |〈v|ψ〉|² / 〈ψ|ψ〉 over all eigenvectors v corresponding to λ. Therefore, in this case, even if |ψ> is not normalized, we can still compute the probabilities by projecting onto the eigenvectors and then dividing by the norm squared of the state. However, in many cases, people normalize the state first. However, sometimes problems present the vector as the actual vector (quantum state), not normalized, avoiding confusion. Taking this problem: since the problem seems to use a short cut. Let\'s check:\n\nBut let me resolve this: if the actual state is given as [ -1, 2, 1 ] as a column vector, that is denoted |ψ>, then if it\'s a valid state vector, then it must be normalized. If not, then maybe assume it\'s proportional to the actual state vector. But in that case, we need to remember that the inner products are computed as is.\n\nBut think in terms of probability: probabilities are |〈eigenvector|ψ〉|² / 〈ψ|ψ〉.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the state\'s normalization, the probability is given by |〈eigenvector|ψ〉|² divided by the squared norm. But since the answer could be ambiguous here. Since neither the problem states that the state is normalized nor does it is specified otherwise, maybe in this do we proceed under the assumption that the state is given not normalized? So perhaps we need to normalize it?\n\nBut to be safe: state is a column vector (-1,2,1). The given probabilities are defined as the projection squared. In standard QM, if |ψ>=(−1,2,1), then the probability to collapse to |v> (eigenvector) would be |<v|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>. Hence, we must normalize the state.\n\nBut maybe in some other conventions, perhaps not. But liable since [0,1\\√2,0] ... but let\'s just proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, confirm that 0 is an eigenvalue. That check.\n\nThen, find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to λ=0.\n\nThen, compute the projection of the given state onto the eigenvector.\n\nThen, the probability is |projection|² divided by the square norm of the original state. Let us start. So first find eigenvector(s) of λ=0.\n\nAs before, P = [\n0,1/√2,0;\n1/√2,0,1/√2;\n0,1/√2,0\n]?\n\nSet (P - 0I)v =0:\n\nThat yields Pv =0. So, writing out the equations:\n\nFirst equation: (1/√2)v2 =0 → v2=0\n\nSecond equation: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3=0 → v1 +v3=0 → v3=−v1\n\nThird equation: (1/√2)v2=0 → same as first equation.\n\nSo accordingly, the eigenvectors are all multiples of (1,0,−1). So the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is the span of the vector (1,0,−1). Furthermore, this eigenvector can be normalized.\n\nCalculating the norm of (1,0,−1)^T: 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2=2→ norm sqrt(2). Hence, normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).\n\nSo eigenvector e₀ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). But depending on, s?? Well to compute the projection:\n\nThe given state vector is (−1, 2, 1). Well in previous times, operations are done over C but in this case, all vectors have real components.\n\nProjection of |ψ> onto |e₀> is simply the inner product as e₀ · ψ.\n\nSo calculate e₀ · ψ = (1/√2)(−1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2.\n\nThen |<e₀|ψ>|² = | -√2 |² = ( √2 )² =2. Probability is probability= |projection|² / ||ψ||²\n\nWait, the norm squared of ψ is (−1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1=6. So the probability is 2/6=1/3.\n\nHence the probability is 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, note that the projection of the vector onto the eigenvector is scalar -√2. So indeed, squared gives 2. The original vector squared norm is 6, so 2/6=1/3≈33.33%.\n\nTherefore the answer is 1/3, so 0.333... Similarly, let me check if Pv=0 for v=(1,0,−1). ) Let\'s check:\n\nFirst the first component of Pv is (0)*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1)=0\n\nSecond component: (1/√2)*1 +0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1)= (1 -1)/√2=0\n\nThird component:0*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1)=0\n\nHence, indeed, true. Hence the eigenvector for λ=0 is correctly (1,0,−1). Then, projection: their inner product gives (-1,2,1)·(1,0,-1)= (-1)*1 +2*0 +1*(-1)= -1 -1= -2. Then absolute squared is 4. And then divide by both norms squared? Wait, hold on: Actually, if the eigenvector isn\'t normalized, the projection formula needs to be adjusted. Wait, when eigenvector is not unit length, but when you compute |<v | ψ>|^2 / <v | v> / <ψ | ψ>? Hmm, perhaps no. Wait, if the eigenvector is not normalized, the probability would be |<v|ψ>|² divided by [<v|v> <ψ|ψ>]. Wait, but standard quantum mechanics formula is when the eigenvectors are orthonormal. If the eigenvector is not part of an orthonormal basis, things complicate. However, since P is Hermitian, the eigenvectors can be chosen orthonormal. Wait, in this case, the eigenvector (1,0,−1) has norm squared 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). Therefore, when we compute ⟨e₀ | ψ⟩, using the normalized eigenvector:\n\n⟨e₀ | ψ⟩= (1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)) · (-1, 2,1)= (-1)/sqrt(2) +0 + (-1)/sqrt(2)= -2/sqrt(2)= -sqrt(2). Then the squared magnitude is 2, and divide by the squared norm of the original ψ, which is 6. So 2/6=1/3.\n\nAlternatively, had we not normalized the eigenvector, just used (1,0,−1), which has norm sqrt(2), then the projection would still be (1,0,-1)·(-1,2,1) = -1*1 + 0*2 + -1*1 = -2. Then, what? The standard probability formula is |⟨v|ψ⟩|²/(⟨v|v⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩). In that case, it would be (4) / (2*6)=4/12=1/3. Same result. So, either way yields 1/3.\n\nTherefore, regardless of one uses normalized eigenvectors or not, the probability is still 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1/3. Hence, the probability is 1/3. So boxed answer is 1/3. But let me verify once again with another method perhaps. For example, diagonalizing matrix P.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that matrix P is symmetric and hence may have orthogonal eigenvectors. If I can find the eigenvalues and the projection onto the corresponding eigenvectors. Let us find all eigenvalues of P.\n\nSet up the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(P - λI) =0.\n\nWrite down the matrix:\n\n| -λ    1/√2    0      |\n\n|1/√2   -λ    1/√2|\n\n|0      1/√2   -λ     |\n\nCompute the determinant:\n\n−λ [ (-lambda)(-lambda) − (1/√2)(1/√2) ] − (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-lambda) − 0 ] + 0[...].\n\nThus, expanding:\n\n= −λ [λ² − 1/2 ] − (1/√2)( -λ /√2 ) + 0\n\n= −λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2 )\n\n= −λ³ + λ.\n\nTherefore determinant expression: -λ³ + λ =0 ⇒ λ(-λ² +1 )=0 ⇒ λ=0,1,-1.\n\nHence, the eigenvalues of P are λ=0,1,-1. Interesting.\n\nThat\'s illustrative. So three eigenvalues -1, 0,1.\n\nThus, they can find probabilities of getting each. But the question is about λ=0. Then, as above, the projection is 1/3 probability. But let me check with existing eigenvectors.\n\nAssuming those eigenvalues, perhaps the eigenvector for λ=0 is as before. Then maybe confirming each.\n\nFor λ=1:\n\n(P - I)v =0:\n\n-1 * v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0\n\n(1/√2) v1 – v2 + (1/√2)v3 =0\n\n(1/√2) v2 – v3 =0\n\nFrom first equation: v1 = (1/√2)v2. From third equation: v2 = (1/√2)v3 --> v3 = √2 v2. Substituting into second equation: (1/√2)( (1/√2)v2) – v2 + (1/√2)(√2 v2 )= (1/2)v2 –v2 + v2 = (1/2)v2=0→v2=0. Then made collapse to zero. Hmm, but then that implies eigenvalues 1 may have other eigenvectors. But wait, maybe I messed up the equations. Wait, set λ=1. The system is:\n\n(P−I)v =0 :\n\nFirst row: [−1 1/√2 0]\n\nSecond row: [1/√2 −1 1/√2]\n\nThird row: [0 1/√2 −1]\n\nSetting up:\n\n-1 * v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 → v1 = (1/√2) v2\n\nThird equation: (1/√2) v2 -1 * v3=0 → v3= (1/√2) v2\n\nSecond equation: (1/√2) v1 -1 * v2 + (1/√2) v3=0\n\nSubstitute v1 and v3 from above:\n\n(1/√2)( (1/√2) v2 ) - v2 + (1/√2)( (1/√2) v2 )\n\n= (1/2) v2 -v2 + (1/2) vz= (1/2 -1 +1/2) v2= (-0)v2=0. So the equations are dependent and allow v2 to variables freely.\n\nHence, taking v2 as parameter s. Then v1 = s/√2, v3 = s/√2. So eigenvectors are (1/√2,1,1/√2) scaled by s. Similarly, norm squared: (1/2 +1 +1/2)=2 . So normalized eigenvector is (1/√2,1,1/√2)/√2 = (1/2, 1/√2, 1/2). However, perhaps original simpler.\n\nSimilarly, for λ=−1, applying similar processes:\n\nPerhaps eigenvectors can be found. Anyway, confirmed the eigenvalues Λ=0,1,-1. Let\'s think whether the normalized eigenvector for 0 as calculated has projection of (−1,2,1) onto it. Then need to verify perhaps by another method.\n\nAlternatively, the state ψ=(-1,2,1). In the eigenbasis of P, it can be written as a linear combination of the eigenvectors for λ=-1,0,1. The probability to measure 0 is |c₀|^2, where c₀ is the coefficient with the eigenvector for 0. As already calculated, that projection length is sqrt(2) [since the normalized eigenvector is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). The inner product is (-1,2,1)•(1,0,-1)/sqrt(2)= (-1*1 + 2*0 +1*(-1))/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2)= -sqrt(2), hence |c₀|^2= (sqrt(2))²=2. But divided by 6 (||ψ||^2?), since state vector isn\'t normalized.\n\nWait, the total norm squared of ψ being 6, we need to divide the |c₀|²=2 by 6, therefore probability 2/6=1/3. So yes,  renders the same result.\n\nAlternatively in another approach using the squared adjacency. Conclusion is satisfactory.\n\nHence just all contesting thoughts till now.

To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable \( P \) will yield 0 at time \( t \), we start by noting that the system is in the state given by the column matrix \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The matrix \( P \) representing the observable is:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

First, we verify that 0 is an eigenvalue of \( P \) by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). However, we can directly find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 by solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \):

1. The first equation gives \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 = 0 \implies v_2 = 0 \).
2. The second equation gives \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0 \implies v_1 + v_3 = 0 \implies v_3 = -v_1 \).

Thus, the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue 0 are of the form \( \mathbf{v} = a \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \). Normalizing this eigenvector, we get \( \mathbf{e}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

Next, we project the state vector \( \psi \) onto this eigenvector. The projection is given by the inner product:

\[
\langle \mathbf{e}_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( 1 \cdot (-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + (-1) \cdot 1 \right) = \frac{-1 - 1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{2}} = -\sqrt{2}
\]

The squared magnitude of this projection is \( |\langle \mathbf{e}_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = (-\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \).

The norm squared of the state vector \( \psi \) is:

\[
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
\]

Therefore, the probability of measuring 0 is:

\[
\frac{|\langle \mathbf{e}_0 | \psi \rangle|^2}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}
\]

 Expanding the determinant for λ=0 (though we already know zero is an eigenvalue):

Writing matrix P:
0      1/√2  0
1/√2  0      1/√2
0     1/√2  0

Let me take the determinant:

Using the first row: 0*(0*0 - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - 1/√2*(1/√2*0 - 1/√2*0) + 0*(something). Hmm, that gives 0 - (1/√2)*(0 - 0) + 0 = 0. So determinant as calculated via first row is indeed 0. Wait, so where did I get 1/(2√2) before? Perhaps I didn't substitute for λ=0. Wait, no—when calculating the characteristic equation det(P - λI) =0, but here in the initial mistake, maybe I forgot to subtract λI. Indeed, I should have determined if 0 is an eigenvalue. To verify if λ=0 is in the spectrum, compute det(P - 0*I) = det(P) = 0. Factorizing:

Sum of the elements of each row or column. First row: 0 + 1/√2 + 0 = 1/√2; second row: 1/√2 +0 +1/√2 = 2/√2 = √2; third row: same as first row, 1/√2. Columns: First column: 0 +1/√2 +0 =1/√2; second column:1/√2 +0 +1/√2 = √2; third column same as first. So, the columns don't obviously indicate linear dependence. But in our eigenvector calculation, we found that a non-zero vector (a,0,-a) satisfies Pv=0. Hence, determinant must be zero, confirming 0 is an eigenvalue.

Hence, earlier my determinant must have been erroneously calculated. Therefore, 0 is an eigenvalue.

So, since zero is an eigenvalue, and the eigenvectors are of the form (a,0,-a).

We can take a specific eigenvector, say (1,0,-1). Then we need to normalize the state vector if necessary, but I think the given state is normalized. Wait, the given state is (-1,2,1). Let's check if it's normalized. Norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the state vector is not normalized. Wait, does that matter? In Quantum Mechanics, states are usually normalized, so perhaps the problem is implicitly assuming normalized vectors? Wait, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)" but operator P is given. If the state vector is not given as normalized, when we calculate probabilities, we should use the state vector normalized. So perhaps we need to normalize the state first.

Wait, the problem says "the state of a system... is given by the column matrix," which could imply that vectors are represented as they are. However, in Quantum Mechanics, the probability depends on the squared amplitude of the projection, regardless of the normalization of the original vector, as the probabilities are normalized by the norm squared of the state vector. Wait, when computing probabilities, even if the total vector is not normalized, the probabilities are the squared modulus of the projections divided by the squared norm of the entire vector. Because suppose |ψ> is given, then the probability is |<eigenvector|ψ>|^2 / <ψ|ψ>.

Wait, let me think. If the actual state vector is |ψ> with components (-1,2,1). Then the norm squared is 1 +4+1 =6. However, usually states are normalized to 1, but perhaps the state as given is not. The standard formula for probability is, for eigenvalue λ, to sum |〈v|ψ〉|² / 〈ψ|ψ〉 over all eigenvectors v corresponding to λ. Therefore, in this case, even if |ψ> is not normalized, we can still compute the probabilities by projecting onto the eigenvectors and then dividing by the norm squared of the state. However, in many cases, people normalize the state first. However, sometimes problems present the vector as the actual vector (quantum state), not normalized, avoiding confusion. Taking this problem: since the problem seems to use a short cut. Let's check:

But let me resolve this: if the actual state is given as [ -1, 2, 1 ] as a column vector, that is denoted |ψ>, then if it's a valid state vector, then it must be normalized. If not, then maybe assume it's proportional to the actual state vector. But in that case, we need to remember that the inner products are computed as is.

But think in terms of probability: probabilities are |〈eigenvector|ψ〉|² / 〈ψ|ψ〉.

Therefore, regardless of the state's normalization, the probability is given by |〈eigenvector|ψ〉|² divided by the squared norm. But since the answer could be ambiguous here. Since neither the problem states that the state is normalized nor does it is specified otherwise, maybe in this do we proceed under the assumption that the state is given not normalized? So perhaps we need to normalize it?

But to be safe: state is a column vector (-1,2,1). The given probabilities are defined as the projection squared. In standard QM, if |ψ>=(−1,2,1), then the probability to collapse to |v> (eigenvector) would be |<v|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>. Hence, we must normalize the state.

But maybe in some other conventions, perhaps not. But liable since [0,1\√2,0] ... but let's just proceed step by step.

First, confirm that 0 is an eigenvalue. That check.

Then, find the eigenvector(s) corresponding to λ=0.

Then, compute the projection of the given state onto the eigenvector.

Then, the probability is |projection|² divided by the square norm of the original state. Let us start. So first find eigenvector(s) of λ=0.

As before, P = [
0,1/√2,0;
1/√2,0,1/√2;
0,1/√2,0
]?

Set (P - 0I)v =0:

That yields Pv =0. So, writing out the equations:

First equation: (1/√2)v2 =0 → v2=0

Second equation: (1/√2)v1 + (1/√2)v3=0 → v1 +v3=0 → v3=−v1

Third equation: (1/√2)v2=0 → same as first equation.

So accordingly, the eigenvectors are all multiples of (1,0,−1). So the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 is the span of the vector (1,0,−1). Furthermore, this eigenvector can be normalized.

Calculating the norm of (1,0,−1)^T: 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2=2→ norm sqrt(2). Hence, normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So eigenvector e₀ = (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). But depending on, s?? Well to compute the projection:

The given state vector is (−1, 2, 1). Well in previous times, operations are done over C but in this case, all vectors have real components.

Projection of |ψ> onto |e₀> is simply the inner product as e₀ · ψ.

So calculate e₀ · ψ = (1/√2)(−1) + 0*2 + (-1/√2)(1) = (-1 -1)/√2 = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Then |<e₀|ψ>|² = | -√2 |² = ( √2 )² =2. Probability is probability= |projection|² / ||ψ||²

Wait, the norm squared of ψ is (−1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 =1 +4 +1=6. So the probability is 2/6=1/3.

Hence the probability is 1/3.

Alternatively, note that the projection of the vector onto the eigenvector is scalar -√2. So indeed, squared gives 2. The original vector squared norm is 6, so 2/6=1/3≈33.33%.

Therefore the answer is 1/3, so 0.333... Similarly, let me check if Pv=0 for v=(1,0,−1). ) Let's check:

First the first component of Pv is (0)*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1)=0

Second component: (1/√2)*1 +0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1)= (1 -1)/√2=0

Third component:0*1 + (1/√2)*0 +0*(-1)=0

Hence, indeed, true. Hence the eigenvector for λ=0 is correctly (1,0,−1). Then, projection: their inner product gives (-1,2,1)·(1,0,-1)= (-1)*1 +2*0 +1*(-1)= -1 -1= -2. Then absolute squared is 4. And then divide by both norms squared? Wait, hold on: Actually, if the eigenvector isn't normalized, the projection formula needs to be adjusted. Wait, when eigenvector is not unit length, but when you compute |<v | ψ>|^2 / <v | v> / <ψ | ψ>? Hmm, perhaps no. Wait, if the eigenvector is not normalized, the probability would be |<v|ψ>|² divided by [<v|v> <ψ|ψ>]. Wait, but standard quantum mechanics formula is when the eigenvectors are orthonormal. If the eigenvector is not part of an orthonormal basis, things complicate. However, since P is Hermitian, the eigenvectors can be chosen orthonormal. Wait, in this case, the eigenvector (1,0,−1) has norm squared 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). Therefore, when we compute ⟨e₀ | ψ⟩, using the normalized eigenvector:

⟨e₀ | ψ⟩= (1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)) · (-1, 2,1)= (-1)/sqrt(2) +0 + (-1)/sqrt(2)= -2/sqrt(2)= -sqrt(2). Then the squared magnitude is 2, and divide by the squared norm of the original ψ, which is 6. So 2/6=1/3.

Alternatively, had we not normalized the eigenvector, just used (1,0,−1), which has norm sqrt(2), then the projection would still be (1,0,-1)·(-1,2,1) = -1*1 + 0*2 + -1*1 = -2. Then, what? The standard probability formula is |⟨v|ψ⟩|²/(⟨v|v⟩⟨ψ|ψ⟩). In that case, it would be (4) / (2*6)=4/12=1/3. Same result. So, either way yields 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of one uses normalized eigenvectors or not, the probability is still 1/3.

Therefore, the answer should be 1/3. Hence, the probability is 1/3. So boxed answer is 1/3. But let me verify once again with another method perhaps. For example, diagonalizing matrix P.

Alternatively, noticing that matrix P is symmetric and hence may have orthogonal eigenvectors. If I can find the eigenvalues and the projection onto the corresponding eigenvectors. Let us find all eigenvalues of P.

Set up the characteristic equation:

det(P - λI) =0.

Write down the matrix:

| -λ    1/√2    0      |

|1/√2   -λ    1/√2|

|0      1/√2   -λ     |

Compute the determinant:

−λ [ (-lambda)(-lambda) − (1/√2)(1/√2) ] − (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-lambda) − 0 ] + 0[...].

Thus, expanding:

= −λ [λ² − 1/2 ] − (1/√2)( -λ /√2 ) + 0

= −λ³ + (λ)/2 + (λ)/2 )

= −λ³ + λ.

Therefore determinant expression: -λ³ + λ =0 ⇒ λ(-λ² +1 )=0 ⇒ λ=0,1,-1.

Hence, the eigenvalues of P are λ=0,1,-1. Interesting.

That's illustrative. So three eigenvalues -1, 0,1.

Thus, they can find probabilities of getting each. But the question is about λ=0. Then, as above, the projection is 1/3 probability. But let me check with existing eigenvectors.

Assuming those eigenvalues, perhaps the eigenvector for λ=0 is as before. Then maybe confirming each.

For λ=1:

(P - I)v =0:

-1 * v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0

(1/√2) v1 – v2 + (1/√2)v3 =0

(1/√2) v2 – v3 =0

From first equation: v1 = (1/√2)v2. From third equation: v2 = (1/√2)v3 --> v3 = √2 v2. Substituting into second equation: (1/√2)( (1/√2)v2) – v2 + (1/√2)(√2 v2 )= (1/2)v2 –v2 + v2 = (1/2)v2=0→v2=0. Then made collapse to zero. Hmm, but then that implies eigenvalues 1 may have other eigenvectors. But wait, maybe I messed up the equations. Wait, set λ=1. The system is:

(P−I)v =0 :

First row: [−1 1/√2 0]

Second row: [1/√2 −1 1/√2]

Third row: [0 1/√2 −1]

Setting up:

-1 * v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 → v1 = (1/√2) v2

Third equation: (1/√2) v2 -1 * v3=0 → v3= (1/√2) v2

Second equation: (1/√2) v1 -1 * v2 + (1/√2) v3=0

Substitute v1 and v3 from above:

(1/√2)( (1/√2) v2 ) - v2 + (1/√2)( (1/√2) v2 )

= (1/2) v2 -v2 + (1/2) vz= (1/2 -1 +1/2) v2= (-0)v2=0. So the equations are dependent and allow v2 to variables freely.

Hence, taking v2 as parameter s. Then v1 = s/√2, v3 = s/√2. So eigenvectors are (1/√2,1,1/√2) scaled by s. Similarly, norm squared: (1/2 +1 +1/2)=2 . So normalized eigenvector is (1/√2,1,1/√2)/√2 = (1/2, 1/√2, 1/2). However, perhaps original simpler.

Similarly, for λ=−1, applying similar processes:

Perhaps eigenvectors can be found. Anyway, confirmed the eigenvalues Λ=0,1,-1. Let's think whether the normalized eigenvector for 0 as calculated has projection of (−1,2,1) onto it. Then need to verify perhaps by another method.

Alternatively, the state ψ=(-1,2,1). In the eigenbasis of P, it can be written as a linear combination of the eigenvectors for λ=-1,0,1. The probability to measure 0 is |c₀|^2, where c₀ is the coefficient with the eigenvector for 0. As already calculated, that projection length is sqrt(2) [since the normalized eigenvector is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). The inner product is (-1,2,1)•(1,0,-1)/sqrt(2)= (-1*1 + 2*0 +1*(-1))/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2)= -sqrt(2), hence |c₀|^2= (sqrt(2))²=2. But divided by 6 (||ψ||^2?), since state vector isn't normalized.

Wait, the total norm squared of ψ being 6, we need to divide the |c₀|²=2 by 6, therefore probability 2/6=1/3. So yes,  renders the same result.

Alternatively in another approach using the squared adjacency. Conclusion is satisfactory.

Hence just all contesting thoughts till now. Maybe overlynth time into this. Therefore, the answer probability is 1/3. So enclosed in box:

However, on re-reading problem: states "the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time t." Taking into account that the given state ψ satisfies an eigenvalue equation if it's an eigenvector for P. As We already saw, it's not necessity, so concluded correct calculation step-by-step. Probability 1/3.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes given the state vector as vector hasn't been normalized. Or the measurement's outcome probability cited as if otherwise.

Ergo, the answer is 1/3, boxed.\n\nHowever, need to check if that's the only eigenvector for λ=0. i.e., multiplicity.If there are multiple eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 () but since dimension is 3, and sum of rank and nullity is 3. If determinant is zero, rank is less than 3. From stepping:\n\nMatrix P has rank 2?

No, but if we delete row1, subtract row2 and row3...\n\nBut when we reduced to triangular we saw that two non-zero rows, so rank 2. Therefore, the null space is 1-dimensional. Hence λ=0 as algebraic multiplicity 1. So just one eigenprojection.\n\nYeah, makes sense.

To calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) yielding 0 at time \( t \), we follow these steps:

1. **Verify that 0 is an eigenvalue of \( P \)**:
   - The matrix \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = \begin{pmatrix}
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
     0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Checking the determinant of \( P \), we find it to be 0, confirming that 0 is an eigenvalue.

2. **Find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0**:
   - Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), we find that the eigenvectors are of the form \( (a, 0, -a) \).
   - The normalized eigenvector is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \).

3. **Project the state vector onto this eigenvector**:
   - The state vector is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \).
   - The projection of \( \psi \) onto the eigenvector \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \left\langle \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1) \mid \psi \right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) + 0 \cdot 2 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}(1) = -\sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Calculate the probability**:
   - The magnitude squared of the projection is \( (-\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \).
   - The norm squared of the state vector \( \psi \) is \( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6 \).
   - The probability is the ratio of these values:
     \[
     \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

Thus, the probability that the measurement of the observable will yield 0 at time \( t \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).

 (-1)^{1+2} = -1. So, determinant contributed by (1,2) component: (-1)^{1+2} * (1/√2) * (minor determinant)= (-1)^3 * (1/√2) * (-1/2) = (-1) * (1/√2) * (-1/2) = (1)/(2√2). One of 1/ special way.

Surprisingly, but method now conflicts. Where's the confusion? Let's note that when expanding the determinant along the first row, considering the original matrix:

The formula is: sum_{j=1}^n a_{1j} C_{1j} where C_{1j} = (-1)^{1+j} M_{1j}

So for the original matrix:

C = elements[0,1/√2,0] at first row.

C_{11}= (-1)^{1+1} * M_{11} (-first minor)= first minor obtained by matrix excluding row1, column1: [[0,1/√2],[1/√2, 0]]. Its determinant: 0*0 -1/√2 *1/√2 = -1/2, so C11= (+) * (-1/2)= -1/2. The element is zero, so contribution is 0*-1/2=0

For element (1,2): value is 1/√2, with cofactor: (-1)^{1+2}= -1, and minor M_{12} is [[1/√2,1/√2],[1/√2,0]]

Determinant of that minor: (1/√2 *0 -1/√2 *1/√2)= -1/2 Thus, C_{12}= (-1) * (-1/2)=1/2

Thus the determinant contribution for element (1,2): 1/√2 *1/2=1/(2√2)

Likewise, for (1,3), it's zero as well.

Hence, initial calculation remains 1/(2√2). But according to row operations, the determinant should be 0. This conflicts, so must resolve.

Ah. Wait, the determinant calculated via row operations, when say swap rows 1 and 2, requires that the determinant swaps sign. The original matrix determinant can be found via converting into upper triangular...but messed up.

Wait, another way. Let me compute determinant for the original 3x3 matrix:

By formula:

det(P) = 0*(0*0 -1/√2 *1/√2) -1/√2*(1/√2 *0 -1/√2 *0) +0*(1/√2*1/√2 -0*0) )

Breaking down:

First term: 0*(something) = 0

Second term: -1/√2*( (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(0) ) = -1/√2* (0) = 0

Third term: 0*(something) =0

Therefore total det(P) must be 0 +0 +0=0! But that's contradicting my previous expansion.

Confusion again. But the formula explicates why those nontrivial terms? Not clearly. Perhaps calling formula confusion.

Wait the general formula for determinant of 3x3:
 
[a,b,c,

d,e,f,

g,h,i]

= a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)

Applied here to P:

First row (0,1/√2,0); second (1/√2,0,1/√2); third (0,1/√2,0)

Applying the formula:

= 0*(0*0 - 1/√2*1/√2) - 1/√2*(1/√2*0 - 1/√2*0) + 0*(1/√2*1/√2 -0*0)

Compute each term:

First term: 0*(0 - 1/2) =0

Second term: -1/√2*(0 -0)= -1/√2*0=0

Third term:0*(1/2 -0)=0

So entire determinant is (0) -0 +0=0. Hence the correct determinant is zero! So why the other method gave 1/(2√2)? Because I made a mistake in calculating that earlier?

Upon expansion along the first row had coefficients 0,1/√2,0. using the cofactors.

Ah, but appropriate sign of cofactors must apply here.

But according to this 3x3 formula the determinant finally used the standard expansions.

If 3x3 formula gives determinant 0, then, determinant should be zero, considering that the cofactor expansion.

But this is a perfect iteration that I swapped rows and arrived at upper triagular with zero.

Therefore, the determinant of P is indeed zero, meaning that 0 is an eigenvalue. So prior computation when I thought determinant was 1/(2√2) was incorrect. The key mistake there was misunderstanding.

It becomes evident that eigenvalues are such that their product is determinant. Since determinant zero implies one eigenvalue is zero, and the others add up to trace.

Trace of P is 0 +0 +0 =0. Hence, if trackings are computed:, sum of eigenvalues is zero, and product (determinant):0 

Assuming a scenario where λ=0, and sum is 0 implies the remaining pair of eigenvalues must add opposite signs.

But perhaps crucial to this query: the eigenspace of λ=0 is non-trivial. Therefore, need to find the eigenvectors.

From previous equations:

Ker(P - 0I) = Ker(P) component's which satisfy Pv=0.

We determined that the eigenvectors take the form (a, 0, -a). So entire eigenspace is spanned by (1, 0, -1) vector.

Check normalization: (1^2 +0 + (-1)^2) =2. Therefore, normalized eigenvector is (1/√2,0,-1/√2)

Is this correct?

Take (1,0,-1):

P acting on it:

First component:

0*1 +1/√2 *0 +0*(-1) =0. Correct, as it's supposed to be zero.

Second component:

1/√2 *1 +0*0 +1/√2*(-1)= (1/√2 -1/√2)=0. Correct.

Third component:

0*1 +1/√2 *0 +0*(-1)=0. Also correct. So (1,0,-1), scaled by1/√2, if we want normalized to length 1, gives unit eigenvector.

So, the eigenvectors correspond to λ=0. So probability of measurement giving 0 is square modulus of the state projected onto that eigenvector.

The state vector is given as |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)

So, first of all, let's normalize this to confirm if it's already normalized.

But first, measure on observable P, but quantum states being normalized, vectors typically considered normalized, but here the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me check whether its norm is 1. Compute sqrt((-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2)=sqrt(1 +4 +1)=sqrt(6). So norm is√6. Hence the state vector is not normalized. Unless stated, perhaps in this problem the vector isn't required to be normalized, but in quantum mechanics, when measuring probabilities, the state must be a unit vector. This problem might present the state un-normalized, but requires calculation assuming it's normalized. Alternatively, it's part of the problem to assume it's un-normalized.

Given this is standard QM, likely to require normalization. Hence, first need to normalize ψ:

|ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 )^T. Norm squared is 1+4+1=6.

Hence normalized state is 1/sqrt(6) (-1,2,1)

Apologies. Therefore, in calculating probabilities, we must account for normalization.

Probability of outcome 0 is |<φ_0 | ψ>|^2 / |ψ|^2, however, Wait. In quantum mechanics probably you need to express ψ as a sum of eigenvectors, then coefficient squared gives the probability. However in spatial vectors, if the already-existent state presented isn't normalized, maybe necessary normalize it, or accept that the state as given, determine probability.

But understanding between born rule: if the vector is in a non-normalized state, then the probability is |<eigen|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>

Let’s for that wikipedia the born rule if state isn't normalized: the probability equals the squared magnitude of the projection over the squared norm of the vector.

So, given that ψ isn't normalized, the probability is given by |<e_0 | ψ>|² divided by the norm squared of ψ

In this problem, since the question states that the observable P is in matrix form, of Hilbert space, and the system state is “given by the column matrix having elements (-1,2,1)”, he assumes explicitly provided state vectors need not be normalized. Potential pitfall.

Unlikely, though. Quantum mechanics dictates states must be normalized. Otherwise probabilities don’t evaluate correctly. Hence, assume that the state given is a vector (bra, ket), not necessarily normalized. Calculate inner product then model accordingly.

So, the steps now that determinant issue is resolve,

1) Find eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 0. i.e., (a,0,-a), and normalized eigenvectors at (1/√2,0,-1/√2)

2) Project given state vector (-1, 2, 1) onto this eigenvector.

3) Compute norm squared of the projection divided by norm squared of original vector. That is probability.

Alternatively:
Since the given formula probability = |<eigenvector|ψ>|^2. But unless eigenvector and state are normalized, must account for it. Here you are:

First, check whether the eigenvector is normalized: (1/√2)^2 +0 + (-1/√2)^2)=1/2 +1/2=1. Yes, normalized.

The original state vector is -1, 2,1 - which is not normalized. (Norm squared is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2=6)

Hence, if the initial state isn't written as a normalized vector (quantum states typically are), then probability would be |<eigen|ψ>|² / <ψ|ψ>.

But depending on how the problem is framed. If specified that the vector is the state vector, then maybe normalization is required and should they have provided a normalized vector. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes given the state vector as vector hasn't been normalized. Or the measurement's outcome probability cited as if otherwise. But for proper answer, must normalize.

Alternatively, perhaps It Given in some defererence vector, but terminology ranges. 

Well, the initial phrasing: “The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix...Calculate the probability....” acceptable in homeworks to sometimes give unnormalized states and selecting yes adds one step. So here,

Compute inner product: <eigenvector | ψ>, eigenvector is (1/√2, 0, -1/√2). Dot product with ( -1,2,1) is:

(1/√2)*(-1) +0*2 + (-1/√2)*(1)= (-1/√2) + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2

Hence modulus squared is (−√2)^2 = 2

Norm of the state vector squared is 6. So probability's 2 /6=1/3. That is 0.333....So the end probability is 1/3.

But to cross-verify computation:

Repeat the steps:

Find the (normalized) eigenvector corresponding to λ=0: (1/√2, 0, -1√2)

Compute the projection: vec dot eigen:

(-1)*(1/√2) + 2*(0) +1*(-1/√2)= (-1 -1)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2

Square the absolute value: (√2 )^2=2 (since |−√2| ^2 is 2)

Divided by norm squared of the original state vector: (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2=6

Thus probability is 2/6 =1/3 or approx 33.33%. Ergo, the answer is 1/3, boxed.

However, need to check if that's the only eigenvector for λ=0. i.e., multiplicity.If there are multiple eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 () but since dimension is 3, and sum of rank and nullity is 3. If determinant is zero, rank is less than 3. From stepping:

Matrix P has rank 2? Since maximum number of linearly independent rows:


Row1: [0, 1/√2,0]

Row2: [1/√2, 0,1/√2]

Row3: [0,1/√2,0]

Row1 and Row3 are copies? Row3 is same as Row1? No, but if we delete row1, subtract row2 and row3...

But when we reduced to triangular we saw that two non-zero rows, so rank 2. Therefore, the null space is 1-dimensional. Hence λ=0 as algebraic multiplicity 1. So just one eigenprojection.

Yeah, makes sense. So if determined appropriately, proceed as above.

Therefore, final probability is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
The probability is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.
