# Original Question

We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

We need to determine the probability that an atom, which has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, will decay in the next 150 minutes. Given that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, we assume an exponential decay model due to the memoryless property of radioactive decay.

1. **Calculate the decay constant (λ):**
   The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so the probability of not decaying is 68%. This gives:
   \[
   e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
   \]
   Solving for λ:
   \[
   \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx \frac{0.385662}{100} \approx 0.00385662 \text{ per minute}
   \]

2. **Determine the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes using the memoryless property:**
   Since the atom has survived 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time 0. This is given by:
   \[
   P(T \leq 150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   Substituting the value of λ:
   \[
   \lambda \cdot 150 = 0.00385662 \cdot 150 \approx 0.578493
   \]
   \[
   e^{-0.578493} \approx 0.5607
   \]
   \[
   P(T \leq 150) \approx 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393
   \]

Thus, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 43.93%, which rounds to 44%.

\[
\boxed{44\%}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. The problem says that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, right? The key property here is that the decay process is memoryless, which means the probability of decaying in the next interval only depends on the length of the interval and not on how much time has already passed. But wait, maybe the problem isn't necessarily assuming the exponential distribution? The given information is a single probability over a fixed time, 32% in 100 minutes. If it were exponential, the decay rate λ would be constant, but let me check how that works.

The exponential decay probability is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). If we know that after 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%, we can set up the equation 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Let me solve for λ here.

Subtracting 1, we get e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Then take the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. First, ln(0.68) is... Hmm, calculator time. Let me approximate. ln(0.7) is roughly -0.35667, and ln(0.68) should be a bit lower. Maybe around -0.38566? Let me check with more precision. Since 0.68 is e^(-0.38566) ≈ 0.68. So approximately λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, is this the right approach? The problem might not be specifying an exponential distribution, but just giving a single point probability. However, without more data points, we might have to assume it's exponential, since we only have one data point. But the problem is the standard way these problems are presented. Also, given the memoryless property, if after 50 minutes it hasn't decayed, then the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as the initial probability for 150 minutes minus the first 50? Wait, not exactly.

If it's memoryless, then the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is simply the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from now. Since exponential distribution is memoryless, surviving 50 minutes doesn't affect the future. So the first step is: find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given 0.32 probability in 100 minutes. Wait, but if we're given 32% in 100 minutes, the λ would be as we calculated.

But if we just use that λ, then the probability of decaying in t minutes is 1 - e^(-λt). After 50 minutes without decay, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes (so total 200 minutes) is conditional probability. For exponential distribution, it's the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes. But wait, maybe not. Wait, conditional probability.

The conditional probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes (total 150 minutes), given that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes. For exponential, that's same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time 0, due to memoryless property. Therefore, yes, the probability would be 1 - e^(-λ*150). But to find λ, since 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32, so λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Therefore, 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Let me compute that. Let's plug in lambda:

λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Then, probability for 150 minutes:

1 - e^(-0.00385662 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.578493) ≈ 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388, so around 43.88%.

But that seems straightforward if we stick to exponential distribution. But I should verify if the problem assumes exponential decay. The question states that "we know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If this is a single observation that 32% of the atoms decay within 100 minutes, then if we model with exponential distribution, that would lead us to compute the lambda as above. But if the decay isn't exponential, then we might need to do a different calculation.

Wait, but atoms (nuclei) decay is typically modeled as exponential. However, the problem might actually not be exponential if there's a different kind of probability distribution. For example, maybe something with a uniform distribution over 100 minutes? That can't be, because if that's the case the probability density would be constant, but that's different. Let's think.

Alternative approach: If the problem is not assuming exponential decay, but just that the probability that the atom decays within 100 minutes is 32%, then what is the model? Maybe it's a single event that occurs with 32% in 100 minutes, but not memoryless. Then, after 50 minutes, since it hasn't decayed, perhaps the decay is more likely or not? Without further information, how would we calculate the probability?

But without knowing the distribution, how can we answer? For example, maybe after 50 minutes, the remaining probability over the next 150 minutes. Wait, but this atom could be a decay product from another atom. So maybe the question should be approached differently. Hmm. Let's see, the problem states: "It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes."

So, given this atom, the prior probability that it decays in 100 minutes is 32%. Then, given it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in next 150 minutes? If the distribution is not specified, but we only have the 32% in 100 minutes, then I think the problem is incomplete unless we assume a memoryless (exponential) distribution, given that's a standard assumption in radioactive decay.

Alternatively, could we interpret this as, each atom has a 32% chance to decay in 100 minutes, independent of the time it has been around. Hmmm.

Wait. Well, let's dig a bit deeper. In reality, decay follows exponential distribution, which implies that the half-life is constant. The fact that 32% have decayed in 100 minutes sets the half-life. Wait, if many identical atoms are observed, and 32% decay in 100 minutes, then N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), hence 0.68 = e^(-λ*100), which gives lambda as previous.

Alternatively, but if the problem is considered in a non-exponential manner. Suppose, the decay is a single event, but in the 100 minute period, there is 32% chance. But that doesn't really make sense unless there's a specific time structure. Perhaps differently, if the decay process has a fixed lifetime, but usually decays are probabilistic.

If they’re saying that a single atom has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes, and we now have an atom that hasn’t decayed in 50 minutes, what is the chance it will decay in the next 150 minutes (which is up to 200 minutes total). So, assuming we do not know the distribution, maybe we could consider that the problem is presented with hidden half-life calculations, but since it's a single time, the problem is pushing toward using conditional probability.

Wait, so in probability terms, we're dealing with conditional probability. The probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. For conditional probability, this is [P(decay between 50 and 200) - P(decay before 50)] / P(not decayed before 50). But here, since "decay between 50 and 200" is equal to decay within 200 minutes minus decay within 50 minutes.

So, mathematically:

P(50 < T ≤ 200 | T > 50) = [P(T ≤ 200) - P(T ≤ 50)] / P(T > 50)

But we need to know P(T ≤ 200) and P(T ≤ 50). However, according to the problem, the only data given is that P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32. If we don't assume a distribution, can we compute this? If we don't know the distribution, the answer is indeterminate because we need more information. But given standard practice in these problems, they usually refer to exponential decay. So, if we do make that assumption, the probability can be calculated.

So, if under the assumption of exponential decay, we use the numbers:

Given P(T ≤ 100) = 0.32, so lambda derived as previously.

Then, compute P(T ≤ 200) and P(T ≤ 50), using this lambda:

P(T ≤ 200) = 1 - e^(-λ*200) = 1 - (e^(-λ*100))^2 = 1 - (0.68)^2 = 1 - 0.4624 = 0.5376

Similarly, P(T ≤ 50) = 1 - e^(-λ*50) = 1 - sqrt(e^(-λ*100)) = 1 - sqrt(0.68). But sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246, so P(T ≤50) ≈ 1 - 0.8246 = 0.1754

Alternatively, we can compute:

For 50 minutes: λ*50 ≈ 0.0038566 *50 ≈ 0.1928, then e^-0.1928 ≈ 0.8247, so P(T <=50) ≈ 1 - 0.8247 ≈ 0.1753 (~17.53%)

Then, the conditional probability would be [0.5376 - 0.1753]/(1 - 0.1753) ≈ (0.3623)/(0.8247) ≈ 0.439, so ~43.9%, which matches the previous figure. So around 43.9%

Alternatively, if I do it without approximating:

First, calculate the total lambda.

Express P(T > 200) = e^(-λ*200) = [e^(-λ*100)]^2 = 0.68^2 = 0.4624

Similarly, P(T >50) = e^(-λ*50) = [e^(-λ*100)]^(0.5) = 0.68^0.5 ≈ sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246

Then,

P(T <=200 | T >50) = [P(T <=200) - P(T <=50)] / P(T>50) = [ (1 - 0.4624) - (1 - 0.8246) ] / 0.8246 = [0.5376 - 0.1754]/0.8246 ≈ 0.3622 / 0.8246 ≈ 0.439, same result.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended not to use calculus, but another approach. Wait an alternative line of thinking. Suppose that per half-life, but since we are given only 32% decay in 100 minutes, what's the relation? For an exponential decay: every half-life time, half of the remaining atoms decay. However, 32% decay in 100 mins implies that 68% remain. 68% is roughly e^(-0.385). So hypothetical 1 half-life would be when remaining is 50%, t_1/2 = (ln 2)/λ. Let me see.

Since λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.385662/100 = 0.0038566 per min. So (ln 2)/λ ≈ 0.6931 / 0.0038566 ≈ 179.68 minutes. So the half-life would be approximately 179.68 minutes? Hmm, but the problem is referring to 100 minutes.

Alternatively, hard to see, but let's get back. Considering that with lambda so defined, half-life is longer than 100 minutes, since after 100 minutes only 32% have decayed. So if I'm interested in the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes given it already survived 50, and going by exponential distribution, the answer is ~43.9%.

However, another way someone might approach it: Since after 50 min survival, the time left is 50 min compared to the original 100? If original decay probability over 100 min is 32%, then maybe intuitively, adjustment for the remaining time.

But if they're thinking in a linear fashion, which is incorrect. For example, in linear decay model: if the probability over 100 minutes is 32%, then the rate per minute is 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute, so over (50 to 200 minutes) total 150 minutes, the probability would be 0.0032 * 150 = 0.48, but this is incorrect, for exponential decay.

However, we know atoms do not decay in linear fashion, so that approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe construe as a uniform distribution over 0 to T, where T is such that integral of PDF from 0 to T is 1, and the probability of decay within 100 min is 32%. But that's pseudo-answer.

Assuming the decay time is uniformly distributed until some maximum time T. Let's see:

If decay is equally likely at any moment until time T, then the CDF would be P(t) = t/T for t <= T. Given that 32% probability at 100 minutes, we have 0.32 = 100/T => T = 100/0.32 ≈ 312.5 minutes. So, after 50 minutes, knowing that it hasn't decayed, what's the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. But if the total possible lifetime is <= T, so we have to be within 50 to 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Since T = 312.5, in uniform model, the probability would be (200 - 50)/ (312.5 - 50) ≈ 150 / 262.5 ≈ 0.5714 or 57.14%.

But wait, this is a completely different answer. So this shows that the answer depends on the assumed probability distribution. But in reality, this approach isn't correct as atomic decay isn't uniform.

So here's the crux: how does the problem expect us to model the decay? The given data is that the probability to decay in 100 mins is 32%, but unless told otherwise, in the context of atomic decay, we need to go with exponential.

Alternatively, if the problem explicitly wants a different approach. Wait but maybe we need to compute it in their terms. Alternatively, someone might use conditional probability by saying the 50 minutes have not resulted in a decay, so the remaining probability is over the next 150 minutes.

But how? So I think in this case, reasonable way is to assume exponential decay due to being standard for such processes and the problem mentioning atomic nucleus decay. Therefore, proceed with that.

Therefore, answer is ~43.9%, but they probably want exact if calculated.

Let me recheck:

Given P(T <= 100) = 0.32, so e^(-100λ) = 0.68

Then λ = -ln(0.68)/100

Then P(T <= 150 | T > 50) = P(T <= 150) - P(T <=50)/ P(T >50). Wait: no, need conditional.

We need P(T <= 200 | T >50), but the event 50 to 200.

Wait: original time after starting is 200 minutes total.

Wait:

Wait, departure is at time zero. Atom is monitored starting at time zero, we know now that at 50 minutes it hasn't decayed. The question is the probability it decays within the next 150 minutes (i.e., between time 50 and 200 minutes).

Conditional probability is defined as:

P(50 < T <= 200 | T >50) = \frac{P(50 < T <=200)}{P(T >50)} = \frac{P(T <=200) - P(T <=50)}{1 - P(T <=50)}.

Under exponential distribution, P(T <= t) = 1 - e^(-λt). As before, with λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating P(T <=200):

1 - e^{-λ*200} = 1 - (e^{-λ*100})^2 = 1 - (0.68)^2 = 1 - 0.4624 = 0.5376

P(T <=50):

1 - e^{-λ*50} =1 - (e^{-λ*100})^{0.5} =1 - (0.68)^{0.5} ≈1 - 0.8246 =0.1754

Therefore,

P(50 < T <=200) =0.5376 - 0.1754 =0.3622

P(T >50) =1 - 0.1754 =0.8246

Therefore conditional probability 0.3622/0.8246 ≈0.439, so 43.9%.

Therefore, 43.9% probability.

But should it be presented exactly? Let's see. Let me compute more precisely.

Let us find λ first.

Since 0.68= e^{-100λ}

Thus, lambda= - ln(0.68)/100 ≈ let's compute ln(0.68).

ln(0.68)≈-0.3856624808.

Thus, lambda≈0.3856624808 /100≈0.003856625 per minute.

Then,P(T<=t1)=1 - e^{-lambda*t1}

So for 200 minutes:

t1=200. 0.003856625*200=0.771325, so e^{-0.771325}= ~0.4624 as above.

For t2=50: 0.003856625*50≈0.19283125, e^{-0.19283125}≈approx with calculator:

Compute 0.19283125: The exponent is approx. e^-0.19.

First, using Taylor series around 0:

For x=0.1928, e^{-x} ≈1 -x +x^2/2 -x^3/6≈1-0.1928 +0.1928^2/2 -0.1928^3/6≈1 -0.1928 +0.0186 -0.0012≈1 -0.1754≈0.8246 which is what we had.

Thus, P(T>50)=0.8246 as before.

Thus, the same calculation gives ~43.9%, which is the answer. So that would be 43.9%, probably they want the answer in percentage, 44% perhaps rounded.

Alternatively, compute mathematically precisely:

Start by lambda= (ln(1/0.68))/100=ln(100/68)/100? Wait:

Actually, wait, no. If e^{-100λ}=0.68, so lambda= (ln(0.68))/ -100.

Thus, ln(0.68)=approx -0.385662. Then lambda=0.385662/100=0.00385662 per min.

In that case, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given it didn't decay in 50 minutes is:

1 - e^{-lambda*150}.

Indeed, since the survival probability after 50 minutes is same lambda, so the remaining time required is 150 minutes. Wait, but with memoryless property, is the probability of decaying in next 150 minutes starting from t=0. Since T is exponential distribution, the survival probability past 50 minutes is T'>0 150 minutes.

So, formula is 1 - e^{-lambda*150} ≈ 1 - e^{-0.00385662*150}=1 - e^{-0.578493}=1 - 0.5612≈0.4388, the same ~43.88%.

Hm, and alternatively, as before, 0.439. Therefore, indeed whether you compute via the memoryless property or via the conditional probability, same result.

Another way: yes, due to the memoryless property, the probability that the atom, having survived 50 minutes, will decay in the next 150 minutes is equal to the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. So substitute the parameter:

If from a fresh atom, probability to decay in 150 minutes is 1 - e^{-lambda*150} is the 43.8%, as opposed to given lambda whose 100 min decay is 32%.

Therefore, either way, the answer is approximately 43.9%.

Thus, the answer would be 44% when rounded, or in fractions perhaps?

But wait, the 32% given is precise. Let me check exactly:

If e^{-100λ}=0.68, so lambda= (ln 0.68)/-100≈0.38566248/100=0.0038566248.

Compute lambda=0.0038566248 per minute.

In 150 minutes from now, the probability is P=1 - e^{-lambda*150}.

Compute that: lambda*150= 0.0038566248*150≈0.5784937

e^{-0.5784937}≈?

Well, for precise calculation:

Let me recall that ln(2)=0.6931. Even 0.57849 ≈0.6931*(0.57849/0.6931)=83% of ln(2).

Alternatively, write 0.57849=0.5 +0.07849. Then e^(-0.5 -0.07849)=e^{-0.5} * e^{-0.07849}.

e^{-0.5}≈0.6065, e^{-0.07849}≈1 -0.07849 +0.07849^2/2 -0.07849^3/6 ≈approx 1 -0.07849 +0.003095 -0.000128≈1 -0.075523≈0.924477. Then multiply to 0.6065*0.9245≈0.6065*0.92=0.557, plus 0.6065*0.0045≈0.0027 ≈0.559 or 0.56.

Hence e^{-0.57849}≈approx 0.56, so 1 -0.56=0.44. Therefore, precisely ~44%.

Indeed, perhaps exactly 44%, so possible answer.

Alternatively, using calculator formulas. Let me use a formula for e^{-x}.

Alternatively, 0.5784937.

Let us find a better approximation.

Let's use e^-0.5 ≈ 0.60653066

Then up to 0.5784937 -0.5 =0.0784937

Approximate e^-0.0784937≈1 -0.0784937 + (0.0784937)^2/2 - (0.0784937)^3/6

Compute term by term:

First term:1.

Second term:-0.0784937.

Third term:+ (0.0784937)^2 /2 = (0.0061614)/2=0.0030807.

Fourth term:- (0.0784937)^3 /6≈ (0.0004838)/6≈0.00008063.

Therefore, total ≈1 -0.0784937 +0.0030807 -0.00008063≈1 -0.075493≈0.924507. Multiply with prior e^-0.5 (0.6065).

Thus total e^-0.5784937≈0.6065*0.924507≈0.6065*(0.9 +0.024507)=0.6065*0.9=0.54585+0.6065*0.024507≈0.54585 +0.014861≈0.5607.

Therefore, e^-0.5784937≈0.5607,so1-0.5607≈0.4393≈ 43.93%, so 43.9% when rounded.

Close to 44.

However, I think even if you use precise calculator calculation, the answer is approximately 43.9%.

So probably, the answer is 43.9%, which as stated, or perhaps in fraction converted from 0.439, but in the problem statement maybe exact? Odd. Wait, 0.439 is approx 43.9%.

Alternatively, if you want exact terms:

Given that 32% decay within 100 minutes, then calculate conditional probability for 150 minutes after survival at 50 mins. Wait, maybe the answer is P=(0.32 + some proportion) over remaining probability. But no, easier with the model.

Alternatively total t is 200 minutes, conditional on T>50.

But complicated without parameter.

But yeah, the correct answer is approx 44% so likely the answer is 44%.

But since 43.9%, in exam settings, likely write as 43.9% or 44%.

Alternatively, since it's probabilistic decay. If exact based decomposition.

Alternatively, given the initial calculation, 0.32 is specified precisely, so .68 not decayed. The formula: the conditional probability is [1 - (0.68)^{150/100}] ?

Wait, Because more generically for exponential:p1(t)=1 -e^{-λ t}, period.

Given that p1(100)=0.32, e^{-100 λ }=0.68 so over a general t interval, after survival of t0, it'd be p(t0, t1) = [1 - e^{-λ (t1 -t0)} ]

Wait, due to memoryless - the future is independent of past. Then if the pre-survived 50 mins, the remaining time is 150 mins, so with lambda,

p(150) =1 -e^{-λ *150)

But lambda from original p(100)=0.32.

Given p(100)= 1 - e^{-100λ}=0.32 => e^{-100λ}=0.68. Hence, e^{-λ *150}=e^{-lambda*100*(1.5)}= (e^{-lambda *100})^1.5=0.68^{1.5}. Therefore, p=(1 -0.68^{1.5} )

Calculate this: 0.68^{1.5}=0.68^(3/2)=sqrt(0.68^3). Compute 0.68^3=0.68*0.68*0.68: 0.4624*0.68=0.314432. Then sqrt(0.314432)= approx 0.5607. Hence, 1 -0.5607=0.4393, so same ans before. Hence must be it, which is previous calculations.

So perhaps doing this, have P=1 -0.68^{3/2}. You can compute that express. Therefore, the exact answer is 1 -0.68^(150/100).

Since given in the Socratic method we might consider more cleanly formulaite.

But overall it's≈43.9%, so needs to box 44% or 0.439.

Alternatively, check whether 0.68^{1.5} is equal to the e^(-0.578). Let's see again,

We had Iambay first way,

Lambda*150≈0.578.

However sqrt(0.68^3)=sqrt(0.314432)=0.5607 as above.

Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. The problem says that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, right? The key property here is that the decay process is memoryless, which means the probability of decaying in the next interval only depends on the length of the interval and not on how much time has already passed. But wait, maybe the problem isn't necessarily assuming the exponential distribution? The given information is a single probability over a fixed time, 32% in 100 minutes. If it were exponential, the decay rate λ would be constant, but let me check how that works.

The exponential decay probability is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). If we know that after 100 minutes, the decay probability is 32%, we can set up the equation 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Let me solve for λ here.

Subtracting 1, we get e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Then take the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. First, ln(0.68) is... Hmm, calculator time. Let me approximate. ln(0.7) is roughly -0.35667, and ln(0.68) should be a bit lower. Maybe around -0.38566? Let me check with more precision. Since 0.68 is e^(-0.38566) ≈ 0.68. So approximately λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

But wait, is this the right approach? The problem might not be specifying an exponential distribution, but just giving a single point probability. However, without more data points, we might have to assume it's exponential, since we only have one data point. But the problem is the standard way these problems are presented. Also, given the memoryless property, if after 50 minutes it hasn't decayed, then the probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as the initial probability for 150 minutes minus the first 50? Wait, not exactly.

If it's memoryless, then the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is simply the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from now. Since exponential distribution is memoryless, surviving 50 minutes doesn't affect the future. So the first step is: find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given 0.32 probability in 100 minutes. Wait, but if we're given 32% in 100 minutes, the λ would be as we calculated.

But if we just use that λ, then the probability of decaying in t minutes is 1 - e^(-λt). After 50 minutes without decay, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes (so total 200 minutes) is conditional probability. For exponential distribution, it's the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes. But wait, maybe not. Wait, conditional probability.

The conditional probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes (total 150 minutes), given that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes. For exponential, that's same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time 0, due to memoryless property. Therefore, yes, the probability would be 1 - e^(-λ*150). But to find λ, since 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32, so λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Therefore, 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Let me compute that. Let's plug in lambda:

λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Then, probability for 150 minutes:

1 - e^(-0.00385662 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.578493) ≈ 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388, so around 43.88%.

But that seems straightforward if we stick to exponential distribution. But I should verify if the problem assumes exponential decay. The question states that "we know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." If this is a single observation that 32% of the atoms decay within 100 minutes, then if we model with exponential distribution, that would lead us to compute the lambda as above. But if the decay isn't exponential, then we might need to do a different calculation.

Wait, but atoms (nuclei) decay is typically modeled as exponential. However, the problem might actually not be exponential if there's a different kind of probability distribution. For example, maybe something with a uniform distribution over 100 minutes? That can't be, because if that's the case the probability density would be constant, but that's different. Let's think.

Alternative approach: If the problem is not assuming exponential decay, but just that the probability that the atom decays within 100 minutes is 32%, then what is the model? Maybe it's a single event that occurs with 32% in 100 minutes, but not memoryless. Then, after 50 minutes, since it hasn't decayed, perhaps the decay is more likely or not? Without further information, how would we calculate the probability?

But without knowing the distribution, how can we answer? For example, maybe after 50 minutes, the remaining probability over the next 150 minutes. Wait, but this atom could be a decay product from another atom. So maybe the question should be approached differently. Hmm. Let's see, the problem states: "It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another ato

"I need to determine the probability of an atom decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed during the first 50 minutes. The problem tells me there's a 32% probability of decay within 100 minutes.

I recall that radioactive decay typically follows an exponential distribution with the memoryless property, meaning the future probability depends only on the interval length, not on previous history. However, I should verify if the problem assumes this distribution since we only have one data point (32% in 100 minutes).

Assuming exponential decay, I can calculate the decay constant λ using the formula P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Since P(100) = 0.32, I can write 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Rearranging gives e^(-100λ) = 0.68, and taking the natural logarithm: -100λ = ln(0.68). Therefore λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Due to the memoryless property of exponential decay, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (after surviving 50 minutes) is the same as the probability it would decay in any 150-minute interval. Using our calculated λ value, this probability is 1 - e^(-λ*150) = 1 - e^(-0.00385662*150) = 1 - e^(-0.578493) ≈ 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388 or about 43.88%.

However, I should consider whether the problem truly assumes an exponential distribution. If it's not exponential but follows some other distribution, the calculation would differ. Without specific information about the distribution, it's difficult to determine how to proceed with a non-exponential approach. The statement that '32% decay within 100 minutes' could potentially refer to various probability distributions.

But since atomic decay is typically modeled as an exponential process in physics, this assumption is reasonable. If we're dealing with a different model or if this atom is a decay product of another atom, that would require additional information and a different approach."

Alright, I need to determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. The problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. Let's think about how to approach this problem.

I recall that radioactive decay is often modeled with an exponential distribution. A crucial feature of this process is its memorylessness, meaning that the probability of decay in the next time interval depends solely on the length of the interval, not on the elapsed time. However, we need to consider if the problem assumes an exponential distribution because we're provided with a single probability over a fixed duration—32% over 100 minutes. In the case of an exponential distribution, the decay rate λ would be a constant, so let's explore this.

The exponential decay probability formula is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Knowing that the decay probability after 100 minutes is 32%, we can establish the equation 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Solving for λ results in:

Subtracting 1 from each side, we have e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives -100λ = ln(0.68), thus λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Now, let me calculate that. The natural logarithm of 0.68 is approximately -0.38566. Therefore, λ is approximately 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

But is this the right method? The problem might be providing just a point probability, not explicitly assuming an exponential distribution. Without more data, assuming exponential decay seems logical as a single data point is all we have. Based on the memoryless property, if the atom hasn’t decayed in 50 minutes, the decay probability for the next 150 minutes is the same as it was initially for just the upcoming 150 minutes, irrespective of the first 50 minutes.

Hence, with the exponential distribution's memorylessness, the chance of decaying in the subsequent 150 minutes, given no decay occurred in 50 minutes, reduces to finding the probability of decaying within those 150 minutes alone because surviving 50 minutes doesn't impact future probabilities.

So, from the exponential perspective, the probability that the atom decays within another 150 minutes after 50 minutes of non-decay remains the probability of decay over a 150-minute period, beginning now. With the 32% probability already provided for 100 minutes as calculated with λ, we apply:

For t = 150 minutes, the decay probability becomes 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Let's compute that:

Using λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute, we find:

1 - e^(-0.00385662 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.578493) ≈ 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388, or approximately 43.88%.

This straightforward method assumes an exponential distribution, but we should validate if the problem presumes exponential decay. It mentions knowing from experiments that decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. If that's a single observation, modeling it with an exponential distribution to determine λ is sensible. Without the decay being exponential, a different calculation might be warranted.

But radioactive decay processes, typically modeled as exponential, could follow a different distribution. Assuming a hypothetical uniform distribution over the time interval would produce a constant probability density, which doesn’t apply here. So, concluding with exponential decay seems most logical unless otherwise specified.

Yet, without extra distribution data, a definite answer might elude us. Alternatively, if the question hints that this decay is a byproduct from a prior event, perhaps the approach shifts. Ultimately, the problem's analytical core is whether it explicitly requires exponential modeling, but without specification, that's our guiding assumption.

We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?"\n\nSince it was obtained from another atom, that may have its own decay process, but once we have the atom, we\'re only concerned with it. The problem of the 32% decay in 100 minutes is given. But if the initial process is not exponential, then 32% in 100 minutes, without more data points, we cannot parameterize the distribution... Is there a standard way?\n\nBut maybe another way. If I consider that within 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, which is like saying that the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%. Since the atom hasn\'t decayed in the first 50 minutes, perhaps if we model it with a uniform distribution?\n\nWait, if the atom either decays in the first 100 minutes with 32% chance, or doesn\'t. If the decay is equally likely to occur at any time within 100 minutes, then the decay time would be uniformly distributed between 0 and 100 minutes. But that\'s assuming that the 32% is the integral over 0 to 100 of a probability density.\n\nWait, but if that\'s uniform, then the probability density function (pdf) is constant over 0 to 100 minutes, and zero after that. But then the total probability of decay in 100 minutes would be the area under the pdf from 0 to 100. Wait, but if it\'s 32%, then the pdf is 0.32 / 100 = 0.0032 per minute. Then, the survival probability at 50 minutes would be 1 - 0.0032*50 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84. Then, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes would be different. But wait, if the decay can only occur up to 100 minutes, then after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is zero. So extending to 150 minutes would be only up to 100, so 50 minutes. Wait, but given that it did not decay in first 50 minutes, then we have 50 minutes left in the uniform model. Then the total decay probability would be 0.0032 per minute from 50 to 100 minutes, so over 50 minutes, 0.0032*50 = 0.16, so 16% chance. Then, the next 50 minutes (from 100 to 150) is zero probability, since decay can only happen within 100 minutes. So total probability is 16%.\n\nBut this seems different from the exponential model and possibly answer. But the problem states, "What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" If the model is uniform with a finite cutoff at 100 minutes, then after 50 minutes, it\'s a 16% chance. But since when you have only 50 minutes left, given uniform distribution. However, if the decay can also happen after 100 minutes, but the given info is that in 100 minutes, there\'s 32% decay probability. Maybe that model is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s a geometric distribution, discretized? Very unlikely. Decay is quantum and continuous, so exponential is the standard model.\n\nBut since the problem gives a 32% chance in 100 minutes, the question is whether that is meant to be exponential or uniform. But the problem probably expects the assumption of exponential decay. Since standard, and since in real-life, radioactive decay is modelled as exponential.\n\nSo under that assumption, after 50 minutes without decay, the remaining time is again exponentially distributed with the same lambda. Then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^{-\\lambda * 150}. Let\'s compute that.\n\nLambda again is -ln(0.68)/100. Then the 150 minutes lambda*t is -ln(0.68)*150/100 = -ln(0.68)*1.5. Therefore, the probability is 1 - e^{ln(0.68)*1.5} = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5}. Because e^{ln(0.68)*1.5} = (0.68)^1.5. Let me calculate that.\n\nSo 0.68^1.5 is equal to 0.68^(1 + 0.5) = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68). Compute sqrt(0.68): approximately 0.8246. Then 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544, plus 0.68 * 0.0246 ≈ 0.0167. So total ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so 43.93%.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute (0.68)^1.5 using logarithms:\n\nln(0.68) = -0.3856624\n\nMultiply by 1.5: -0.5784936\n\nExponential of that gives e^(-0.5784936) ≈ 0.5612, so 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388, so 43.88%. Either way, approximately 43.9%. Which is close to the 43.88% I had before.\n\nBut the answer isn\'t a round number, but maybe it\'s supposed to be 44%. Alternatively, could there be another approach?\n\nWait, maybe not assuming an exponential distribution but using conditional probability. The atom has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes. Given that it didn\'t decay in 50 minutes, what\'s the probability it decays within the next 150 minutes. But after 50 minutes, the remaining time till 100 minutes is 50 minutes. But the question is for the next 150 minutes. So, total time from initial would be 200 minutes. But how does that interact?\n\nIf there was a hard cutoff, which perhaps only 32% of atoms decay within 100 minutes, and the rest never decay. Then, the atom has a survival probability of 68% at 100 minutes. If in the first 50 minutes it hasn\'t decayed, then over the next 50 minutes (from 50 to 100), the probability of decay would be the original 32% conditional on not decaying in the first 50 minutes. So the conditional probability is (original decay probability - decayed in first 50) / survival probability of first 50.\n\nBut we don\'t know the decay probability in first 50 minutes. If under this hard cutoff model, where the atom can only decay within 100 minutes, and if it decays, it\'s equally likely at any time. So using that model: if the atom\'s decay time is uniformly distributed between 0 and 100 minutes. Then over 0 to 100, decay has 32% chance. Wait, but if it\'s uniform, it\'s not 32%, it would be if the total probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, then the pdf is 0.32/100 per minute, right?\n\nWait, if probabilty density function is f(t) = c for 0 <= t <= 100, and zero otherwise. Then, the total probability is integral of f(t) over [0,100] = 100c = 0.32. Therefore, c = 0.0032.\n\nTherefore, if the atom hasn\'t decayed in 50 minutes, that tells me that the decay time is greater than 50. So conditional pdf is f(t)/(1 - F(50)), where F(50) is the cumulative distribution at 50 minutes.\n\nF(50) = integral from 0 to 50 of 0.0032 dx = 0.0032 * 50 = 0.16. Therefore, the survival probability at 50 minutes is 1 - 0.16 = 0.84. Therefore, the conditional pdf is 0.0032 / 0.84 ≈ 0.0038095 per minute for t between 50 and 100, and zero otherwise. Then, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (which, from 50 minutes, goes up to 200 minutes) but in this model, after 100 minutes, no decay is possible, so the integration is from 50 to 100 minutes. Therefore, the conditionally probability is integral from 50 to 100 of 0.0038095 dt = 0.0038095 * 50 = 0.1905. So approximately 19.05%.\n\nBut isn\'t this conflicting with the exponential model\'s result of ~44%? So here came out different.\n\nBut which model is correct? How do we know?\n\nProblem says: "We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." Without more data, stating exactly that. So if the decay is a process where atoms have decay probability 32% within the first 100 minutes and if it does decay, then when does it happen? If we don\'t have more information, maybe they expect an answer based on the conditional probability where by surviving first 50 minutes, the remaining probability is (0.32 - decayed in first 50 minutes)/0.68. But unless you have info on the distribution.\n\nAlternatively, in the absence of other information, but given that the process is usually exponential in physics, especially for atomic decay, the answer should use the exponential model.\n\nBut why is the first model different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a simple proportion. If the decay was certain to happen exactly at 100 minutes with 32%, but that doesn\'t make much sense.\n\nWait, given that this is of the atomic nucleus, we\'re talking about beta decay. Beta decay is a quantum mechanical process and is typically modelled as exponential. Therefore, you should use the memoryless property.\n\nHence, the problem expects the exponential distribution assumption.\n\nTherefore the correct approach is using the exponential distribution to calculate the probability.\n\nGiven that, let\'s redo the computation step.\n\nGiven: Probability decay within 100 minutes = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} => e^{-100λ} = 0.68 => λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nThe probability of decaying within the next 150 minutes (from now, given it\'s already been 50 minutes and hasn\'t decayed), by memoryless property, is the same as the probability that a new atom decays within 150 minutes. Therefore, this would be 1 - e^{-λ*150}.\n\nCompute 150λ:\n\n150 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.57849\n\nTherefore, e^{-0.57849} ≈ 0.5612\n\nSo the probability is 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388 ≈ 43.88%, so approximately 43.9%. So if we convert this into a percentage and round it, it\'s approximately 43.9% or 44%.\n\nBut maybe we need to keep more decimals. Wait, perhaps the exact value can be calculated using exponents.\n\nAlternatively, since in the exponential model, the conditional probability to survive t more minutes given survival up to now is e^{-λ t}. So, the probability to decay within the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^{-lambda * 150}. Alternatively, recall that 0.68 is the 100-minute survival probability. Then, converting lambda, such that S(100) = 0.68 = e^{-100λ}. Then, the 150-minute survival probability S(150) = e^{-lambda * 150} = (e^{-100λ})^{1.5} = 0.68^{1.5}. Hence, the probability of decaying within 150 minutes is 1 - 0.68^{1.5}.\n\nConfirming that with a calculator: 0.68^1.5.\n\nFirst compute sqrt(0.68). Sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Then, 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5612, so 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388.\n\nYes. So the exact answer is 1 - 0.68^(3/2). That could be kept as exact if they want, but as decimal, it\'s 0.4388 approximately, so 43.88%.\n\nSince the original decay probability is given in percentage (32%), the answer probably expects a percentage, perhaps rounded. 43.88 is about 43.9%, but 43.9% isn\'t the standard answer. But let me check with exact computation.\n\n0.68^(1.5):\n\nTaking ln(0.68) = -0.3856624808\n\nMultiply by 1.5: -0.5784937212\n\ne^{-0.5784937212} ≈ e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is 0.5488, and 0.5784937212 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Using Taylor series or linear approximation. Alternatively, let\'s check e^-0.5784937212.\n\nWe know that:\n\nln(0.5612) ≈ ln(0.5) + ln(1.122) ≈ -0.6931 + 0.1153 ≈ -0.5778, which is close to -0.57849, so e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5612 which corresponds to 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388. So yes.\n\nTherefore, approximately 43.88%. The question is, do they want the answer in boxed format with one decimal or as a whole number? If 44%, but possibly they can write 43.9% or the exact fraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different way to calculate.\n\nWait, alternative approach. If probability to decay in first 100 minutes is 32%, the survival probability is 68%. If the decay is exponential, then the survival probability to time t is S(t) = e^{-λ t}, so S(100) = 0.68.\n\nWe want S(total). The problem is, after 50 minutes, S(50) = e^{-50λ}. Then, S(t) relative to the survived 50 minutes is S_total(t) = S(t)/S(50) due to memoryless property.\n\nBut here, we want the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. That is 1 - S(150)/S(50). But since S(150) = e^{-150λ} and S(50) = e^{-50λ}, the ratio S(150)/S(50) = e^{-150λ}/e^{-50λ} = e^(-100λ) = S(100) = 0.68. Hence, the probability of decaying within 150 minutes given survival up to 50 minutes is 1 - 0.68 = 0.32. Wait, that contradicts previous result of 43.88%.\n\nWait, that cannot be. Wait S(t+50)/S(50) is the survival probability for an additional t minutes. If we want t=150. Huh, actually the survival probability after 50 minutes for another 150 minutes (total 200 from start) would be S(200)/S(50). But we had S(200) = e^{-200λ} = (e^{-100λ})^2 = 0.68^2 = 0.4624. S(50) = (e^{-100λ})^{0.5} = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Then, S(200)/S(50) ≈ 0.4624 / 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607, so 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, again the same.\n\nWait, that suggests that there was an error in the previous step when I considered survival or the conditional probability?\n\nWait, perhaps my first way of thinking had a miscalculation. Let\'s see:\n\nThe conditional survival probability after 50 minutes is S(t + 50)/S(50). So if we want the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes (150 minutes interval), then it\'s 1 - S(200)/S(50).\n\nAs shown above, that\'s approximately 0.4393.\n\nBut when I initially thought t is 150, trying to see S(t)/S(50)? Wait confusion. If we consider t minutes after the 50, then total time from start is 50 + t.\n\nTherefore, survival probability for t minutes more is S(50 + t)/S(50), so decay probability is 1 - S(50 + t)/S(50). In this case, t = 150. Therefore, then decay probability is 1 - S(200)/S(50).\n\nSince S(t) = e^{-λ t}. Thus, yes:\n\n1 - e^{-λ (200)} / e^{-λ (50)} = 1 - e^{-λ (150)}, which is same as above.\n\nBut wait how does this compare to the original relation?\n\nYes, that\'s the same step. So equally expanded, even if you have a time that exceeds the previous 100 minutes. So lambda is defined as S(t)=e^{-λ t}, which means even if we go beyond the initial 100 minutes, t just keeps increasing. Therefore, the previous answer seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approx 43.9%？\n\nBut reversing the problem: total probability. Let\'s double-check with the values.\n\nIf the initial decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so at lambda based on that. Probability after 50 minutes of survival is S(50) = e^(-50λ). Then, going deeper.\n\nBut wait, can we parameterize using the given decay probability? So, only P(100) = 0.32.\n\nWait the memoryless property needs to hold, perhaps some function fulfills S(t + s | survived t) = S(s). For exponential, sure. For other models, different.\n\nBut given 32% decay over 100 minutes, the fractional decay depends on the model. But from the problem\'s perspective, if they mentioned atomic nucleus, so the intended answer relies on exponential decay.\n\nTherefore, writing 43.9% is problematic since the problem may take radical exact value.\n\nWait, but It can be written as 1 - 0.68^(150/100). So since 0.68^(1.5) is equal to the e^{1.5 * ln(0.68)}. If they want an exact expression, instead of approximated decimal.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s write from scratch: During 100 minutes, it\'s 32% decay, so survival probability S(100) = 68%. The survival probability at time t is S(t) = (S(100))^(t/100). So that for t = 100, it\'s (0.68)^(1) = 0.68, which makes sense. Wait, if modeling with a Weibull distribution with shape parameter 1, which is exponential. Wait, but exponential isn\'t, power relation.\n\nWait, it\'s suddenly homegeneous function. If assuming S(t) = 0.68^(t/100). That basically defines the survival function as a exponential-type where the decay rate is log(0.68)/100. Then that would actually be the same as the exponential model.\n\nTherefore, differentiating the two: S(t) = e^{-λ t} = 0.68^{t/100}. Because substituting λ = - ln(0.68)/100.\n\nHence, whether written as (0.68)^{t/100} or e^{-λ t}, it\'s equivalent. So then compute the probability for 150 minutes as 1 - (0.68)^{150/100} which is 1 - 0.68^{1.5} gives same as before, approx 43.88%.\n\nSo therefore, the exact value is 1 - 0.68^(3/2). If compute this on a calculator, ensure precision:\n\nFirst, 0.68^1.5:\n\nTake natural logarithm of 0.68: ln(0.68) = -0.3856624808.\n\nMultiply by 1.5: -0.5784937212.\n\nExponentiate: e^{-0.578493721} ≈ e^{-0.57849} ≈ as before, approx. 0.5612. Thus, 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388.\n\nAlternative approach if more precise:\n\nCompute 0.68^1.5:\n\nExpress 0.68 as 68/100 = 17/25.\n\n(17/25)^1.5 = (17/25)^(3/2) = sqrt((17/25)^3) = sqrt(4913 / 15625) = sqrt(4913)/sqrt(15625) = sqrt(4913)/125\n\nCalculate sqrt(4913):\n\n70^2 = 4900, 70.1^2 = 4914.01, which is approximate. So sqrt(4913) ≈70.1 roughly. Because 70.1^2 = (70 + 0.1)^2 = 70^2 + 2*70*0.1 + 0.1^2 = 4900 + 14 + 0.01 = 4914.01. So sqrt(4913) ≈70.1 - (4914.01-4913)/(2*70.1) ≈70.1 - 1.01/140.2 ≈70.1 -0.0072≈70.0928, so approximate to 70.0928.\n\nThus sqrt(4913)/125 ≈70.0928 /125 ≈0.56074.\n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.56074 ≈0.43926, so approximate to 0.4393, which is ≈43.93%. So around 43.9%.\n\nTherefore，although this is approximate, but it is precise to two decimal places: 43.88%, 43.93% are close.\n\nBut how precise do they need? Original data: 32% (possibly two significant figures). Thus, the answer should have two significant figures, that is approximately 44%.\n\nThus,boxed answer should be \\boxed{44\\%}。\n\nBut, must check if 43.88 is closer to 44% or 43.9%. 0.4388 is 43.88%, which is approximately 43.9%, but as percent with one decimal, but since the original value is 32% with no decimal, then usually answering with integer percentage, thus 44%.\n\nBut recently the problem is given to another person, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, clarifying, if it\'s exactly (1 - (0.68)^1.5). Is 0.68 provided as exact, then writing as boxed{1 - (0.68)^{3/2}} but likely expecting the approximate 44%.\n\nBut since the user example challenges in the previous think and responses are usually precise with two decimal or so.\n\nAlternatively，maybe the initial information is 32% within 100 minutes, which implies =⋅than previous answer if using alternative method\n\nWait reconsider，the problem could be that the survival time is between t to t + delta: so perhaps integrating over remaining time. But if the problem data is purely 32% chance within 100-minute decay, but with no additional distribution info, but given that it hasn\'t decayed in 50 minutes, then what\'s the probability that it will decay within the next 150 minutes.\n\nWait, in this case, can\'t apply time scaling.\n\nBut if supposed quantum decay is in principle that there is a constant probability per unit time, so math gets to the exponential distribution. Therefore, best bet is 44%.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo after analyzing various approaches, the exponential model gives approximately 43.9% and 44% when rounding, which aligns with atomic decay\'s memoryless property. Other models like uniform give 19% but that lacks physical basis for decay processes. Therefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{44\\%}\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \\boxed{44\\%}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743815274, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5628, prompt_tokens=1374, total_tokens=7002, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Given that the decay probability of an atom is 32% within 100 minutes, we need to determine the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. 

1. **Exponential Distribution Assumption**:
   - Radioactive decay is typically modeled using an exponential distribution, which has the memoryless property. This property states that the probability of decay in a future interval depends only on the length of the interval and not on the time already elapsed.
   - The decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, which translates to a survival probability of 68% (\(S(100) = 0.68\)).

2. **Determine the Decay Constant (\(\lambda\))**:
   - Using the exponential decay formula \(S(t) = e^{-\lambda t}\), we solve for \(\lambda\):
     \[
     0.68 = e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
     \]
     \[
     \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \text{ per minute}
     \]

3. **Probability of Decay in the Next 150 Minutes**:
   - Using the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is calculated as:
     \[
     P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
     \]
   - Substituting \(\lambda\):
     \[
     P(\text{decay in 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-0.0038566 \cdot 150}
     \]
     \[
     = 1 - e^{-0.57849} \approx 1 - 0.5612 \approx 0.4388
     \]

4. **Approximation and Rounding**:
   - The result is approximately 43.88%, which rounds to 44% when considering significant figures from the original data (32%).

Thus, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \(\boxed{44\%}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

.]m) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?"

Since it was obtained from another atom, that may have its own decay process, but once we have the atom, we're only concerned with it. The problem of the 32% decay in 100 minutes is given. But if the initial process is not exponential, then 32% in 100 minutes, without more data points, we cannot parameterize the distribution... Is there a standard way?

But maybe another way. If I consider that within 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, which is like saying that the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%. Since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, perhaps if we model it with a uniform distribution?

Wait, if the atom either decays in the first 100 minutes with 32% chance, or doesn't. If the decay is equally likely to occur at any time within 100 minutes, then the decay time would be uniformly distributed between 0 and 100 minutes. But that's assuming that the 32% is the integral over 0 to 100 of a probability density.

Wait, but if that's uniform, then the probability density function (pdf) is constant over 0 to 100 minutes, and zero after that. But then the total probability of decay in 100 minutes would be the area under the pdf from 0 to 100. Wait, but if it's 32%, then the pdf is 0.32 / 100 = 0.0032 per minute. Then, the survival probability at 50 minutes would be 1 - 0.0032*50 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84. Then, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes would be different. But wait, if the decay can only occur up to 100 minutes, then after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is zero. So extending to 150 minutes would be only up to 100, so 50 minutes. Wait, but given that it did not decay in first 50 minutes, then we have 50 minutes left in the uniform model. Then the total decay probability would be 0.0032 per minute from 50 to 100 minutes, so over 50 minutes, 0.0032*50 = 0.16, so 16% chance. Then, the next 50 minutes (from 100 to 150) is zero probability, since decay can only happen within 100 minutes. So total probability is 16%.

But this seems different from the exponential model and possibly answer. But the problem states, "What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" If the model is uniform with a finite cutoff at 100 minutes, then after 50 minutes, it's a 16% chance. But since when you have only 50 minutes left, given uniform distribution. However, if the decay can also happen after 100 minutes, but the given info is that in 100 minutes, there's 32% decay probability. Maybe that model is different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a geometric distribution, discretized? Very unlikely. Decay is quantum and continuous, so exponential is the standard model.

But since the problem gives a 32% chance in 100 minutes, the question is whether that is meant to be exponential or uniform. But the problem probably expects the assumption of exponential decay. Since standard, and since in real-life, radioactive decay is modelled as exponential.

So under that assumption, after 50 minutes without decay, the remaining time is again exponentially distributed with the same lambda. Then, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^{-\lambda * 150}. Let's compute that.

Lambda again is -ln(0.68)/100. Then the 150 minutes lambda*t is -ln(0.68)*150/100 = -ln(0.68)*1.5. Therefore, the probability is 1 - e^{ln(0.68)*1.5} = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5}. Because e^{ln(0.68)*1.5} = (0.68)^1.5. Let me calculate that.

So 0.68^1.5 is equal to 0.68^(1 + 0.5) = 0.68 * sqrt(0.68). Compute sqrt(0.68): approximately 0.8246. Then 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.68 * 0.8 = 0.544, plus 0.68 * 0.0246 ≈ 0.0167. So total ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, so 43.93%.

Alternatively, if I compute (0.68)^1.5 using logarithms:

ln(0.68) = -0.3856624

Multiply by 1.5: -0.5784936

Exponential of that gives e^(-0.5784936) ≈ 0.5612, so 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388, so 43.88%. Either way, approximately 43.9%. Which is close to the 43.88% I had before.

But the answer isn't a round number, but maybe it's supposed to be 44%. Alternatively, could there be another approach?

Wait, maybe not assuming an exponential distribution but using conditional probability. The atom has a 32% chance to decay within 100 minutes. Given that it didn't decay in 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays within the next 150 minutes. But after 50 minutes, the remaining time till 100 minutes is 50 minutes. But the question is for the next 150 minutes. So, total time from initial would be 200 minutes. But how does that interact?

If there was a hard cutoff, which perhaps only 32% of atoms decay within 100 minutes, and the rest never decay. Then, the atom has a survival probability of 68% at 100 minutes. If in the first 50 minutes it hasn't decayed, then over the next 50 minutes (from 50 to 100), the probability of decay would be the original 32% conditional on not decaying in the first 50 minutes. So the conditional probability is (original decay probability - decayed in first 50) / survival probability of first 50.

But we don't know the decay probability in first 50 minutes. If under this hard cutoff model, where the atom can only decay within 100 minutes, and if it decays, it's equally likely at any time. So using that model: if the atom's decay time is uniformly distributed between 0 and 100 minutes. Then over 0 to 100, decay has 32% chance. Wait, but if it's uniform, it's not 32%, it would be if the total probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, then the pdf is 0.32/100 per minute, right?

Wait, if probabilty density function is f(t) = c for 0 <= t <= 100, and zero otherwise. Then, the total probability is integral of f(t) over [0,100] = 100c = 0.32. Therefore, c = 0.0032.

Therefore, if the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, that tells me that the decay time is greater than 50. So conditional pdf is f(t)/(1 - F(50)), where F(50) is the cumulative distribution at 50 minutes.

F(50) = integral from 0 to 50 of 0.0032 dx = 0.0032 * 50 = 0.16. Therefore, the survival probability at 50 minutes is 1 - 0.16 = 0.84. Therefore, the conditional pdf is 0.0032 / 0.84 ≈ 0.0038095 per minute for t between 50 and 100, and zero otherwise. Then, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (which, from 50 minutes, goes up to 200 minutes) but in this model, after 100 minutes, no decay is possible, so the integration is from 50 to 100 minutes. Therefore, the conditionally probability is integral from 50 to 100 of 0.0038095 dt = 0.0038095 * 50 = 0.1905. So approximately 19.05%.

But isn't this conflicting with the exponential model's result of ~44%? So here came out different.

But which model is correct? How do we know?

Problem says: "We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." Without more data, stating exactly that. So if the decay is a process where atoms have decay probability 32% within the first 100 minutes and if it does decay, then when does it happen? If we don't have more information, maybe they expect an answer based on the conditional probability where by surviving first 50 minutes, the remaining probability is (0.32 - decayed in first 50 minutes)/0.68. But unless you have info on the distribution.

Alternatively, in the absence of other information, but given that the process is usually exponential in physics, especially for atomic decay, the answer should use the exponential model.

But why is the first model different.

Alternatively, maybe a simple proportion. If the decay was certain to happen exactly at 100 minutes with 32%, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, given that this is of the atomic nucleus, we're talking about beta decay. Beta decay is a quantum mechanical process and is typically modelled as exponential. Therefore, you should use the memoryless property.

Hence, the problem expects the exponential distribution assumption.

Therefore the correct approach is using the exponential distribution to calculate the probability.

Given that, let's redo the computation step.

Given: Probability decay within 100 minutes = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100λ} => e^{-100λ} = 0.68 => λ = -ln(0.68)/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

The probability of decaying within the next 150 minutes (from now, given it's already been 50 minutes and hasn't decayed), by memoryless property, is the same as the probability that a new atom decays within 150 minutes. Therefore, this would be 1 - e^{-λ*150}.

Compute 150λ:

150 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.57849

Therefore, e^{-0.57849} ≈ 0.5612

So the probability is 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388 ≈ 43.88%, so approximately 43.9%. So if we convert this into a percentage and round it, it's approximately 43.9% or 44%.

But maybe we need to keep more decimals. Wait, perhaps the exact value can be calculated using exponents.

Alternatively, since in the exponential model, the conditional probability to survive t more minutes given survival up to now is e^{-λ t}. So, the probability to decay within the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^{-lambda * 150}. Alternatively, recall that 0.68 is the 100-minute survival probability. Then, converting lambda, such that S(100) = 0.68 = e^{-100λ}. Then, the 150-minute survival probability S(150) = e^{-lambda * 150} = (e^{-100λ})^{1.5} = 0.68^{1.5}. Hence, the probability of decaying within 150 minutes is 1 - 0.68^{1.5}.

Confirming that with a calculator: 0.68^1.5.

First compute sqrt(0.68). Sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Then, 0.68 * 0.8246 ≈ 0.5612, so 1 - 0.5612 ≈ 0.4388.

Yes. So the exact answer is 1 - 0.68^(3/2). That could be kept as exact if they want, but as decimal, it's 0.4388 approximately, so 43.88%.

Since the original decay probability is given in percentage (32%), the answer probably expects a percentage, perhaps rounded. 43.88 is about 43.9%, but 43.9% isn't the standard answer. But let me check with exact computation.

0.68^(1.5):

Taking ln(0.68) = -0.3856624808

Multiply by 1.5: -0.5784937212

e^{-0.5784937212} ≈ e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is 0.5488, and 0.5784937212 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Using Taylor series or linear approximation. Alternatively, let's check e^-0.5784937212.

We know that:

ln(0.5612) ≈ ln(0.5) + ln(1.122) ≈ -0.6931 + 0.1153 ≈ -0.5778, which is close to -0.57849, so e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5612 which corresponds to 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388. So yes.

Therefore, approximately 43.88%. The question is, do they want the answer in boxed format with one decimal or as a whole number? If 44%, but possibly they can write 43.9% or the exact fraction.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to calculate.

Wait, alternative approach. If probability to decay in first 100 minutes is 32%, the survival probability is 68%. If the decay is exponential, then the survival probability to time t is S(t) = e^{-λ t}, so S(100) = 0.68.

We want S(total). The problem is, after 50 minutes, S(50) = e^{-50λ}. Then, S(t) relative to the survived 50 minutes is S_total(t) = S(t)/S(50) due to memoryless property.

But here, we want the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. That is 1 - S(150)/S(50). But since S(150) = e^{-150λ} and S(50) = e^{-50λ}, the ratio S(150)/S(50) = e^{-150λ}/e^{-50λ} = e^(-100λ) = S(100) = 0.68. Hence, the probability of decaying within 150 minutes given survival up to 50 minutes is 1 - 0.68 = 0.32. Wait, that contradicts previous result of 43.88%.

Wait, that cannot be. Wait S(t+50)/S(50) is the survival probability for an additional t minutes. If we want t=150. Huh, actually the survival probability after 50 minutes for another 150 minutes (total 200 from start) would be S(200)/S(50). But we had S(200) = e^{-200λ} = (e^{-100λ})^2 = 0.68^2 = 0.4624. S(50) = (e^{-100λ})^{0.5} = sqrt(0.68) ≈ 0.8246. Then, S(200)/S(50) ≈ 0.4624 / 0.8246 ≈ 0.5607, so 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, again the same.

Wait, that suggests that there was an error in the previous step when I considered survival or the conditional probability?

Wait, perhaps my first way of thinking had a miscalculation. Let's see:

The conditional survival probability after 50 minutes is S(t + 50)/S(50). So if we want the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes (150 minutes interval), then it's 1 - S(200)/S(50).

As shown above, that's approximately 0.4393.

But when I initially thought t is 150, trying to see S(t)/S(50)? Wait confusion. If we consider t minutes after the 50, then total time from start is 50 + t.

Therefore, survival probability for t minutes more is S(50 + t)/S(50), so decay probability is 1 - S(50 + t)/S(50). In this case, t = 150. Therefore, then decay probability is 1 - S(200)/S(50).

Since S(t) = e^{-λ t}. Thus, yes:

1 - e^{-λ (200)} / e^{-λ (50)} = 1 - e^{-λ (150)}, which is same as above.

But wait how does this compare to the original relation?

Yes, that's the same step. So equally expanded, even if you have a time that exceeds the previous 100 minutes. So lambda is defined as S(t)=e^{-λ t}, which means even if we go beyond the initial 100 minutes, t just keeps increasing. Therefore, the previous answer seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is approx 43.9%？

But reversing the problem: total probability. Let's double-check with the values.

If the initial decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so at lambda based on that. Probability after 50 minutes of survival is S(50) = e^(-50λ). Then, going deeper.

But wait, can we parameterize using the given decay probability? So, only P(100) = 0.32.

Wait the memoryless property needs to hold, perhaps some function fulfills S(t + s | survived t) = S(s). For exponential, sure. For other models, different.

But given 32% decay over 100 minutes, the fractional decay depends on the model. But from the problem's perspective, if they mentioned atomic nucleus, so the intended answer relies on exponential decay.

Therefore, writing 43.9% is problematic since the problem may take radical exact value.

Wait, but It can be written as 1 - 0.68^(150/100). So since 0.68^(1.5) is equal to the e^{1.5 * ln(0.68)}. If they want an exact expression, instead of approximated decimal.

Alternatively, let's write from scratch: During 100 minutes, it's 32% decay, so survival probability S(100) = 68%. The survival probability at time t is S(t) = (S(100))^(t/100). So that for t = 100, it's (0.68)^(1) = 0.68, which makes sense. Wait, if modeling with a Weibull distribution with shape parameter 1, which is exponential. Wait, but exponential isn't, power relation.

Wait, it's suddenly homegeneous function. If assuming S(t) = 0.68^(t/100). That basically defines the survival function as a exponential-type where the decay rate is log(0.68)/100. Then that would actually be the same as the exponential model.

Therefore, differentiating the two: S(t) = e^{-λ t} = 0.68^{t/100}. Because substituting λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Hence, whether written as (0.68)^{t/100} or e^{-λ t}, it's equivalent. So then compute the probability for 150 minutes as 1 - (0.68)^{150/100} which is 1 - 0.68^{1.5} gives same as before, approx 43.88%.

So therefore, the exact value is 1 - 0.68^(3/2). If compute this on a calculator, ensure precision:

First, 0.68^1.5:

Take natural logarithm of 0.68: ln(0.68) = -0.3856624808.

Multiply by 1.5: -0.5784937212.

Exponentiate: e^{-0.578493721} ≈ e^{-0.57849} ≈ as before, approx. 0.5612. Thus, 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388.

Alternative approach if more precise:

Compute 0.68^1.5:

Express 0.68 as 68/100 = 17/25.

(17/25)^1.5 = (17/25)^(3/2) = sqrt((17/25)^3) = sqrt(4913 / 15625) = sqrt(4913)/sqrt(15625) = sqrt(4913)/125

Calculate sqrt(4913):

70^2 = 4900, 70.1^2 = 4914.01, which is approximate. So sqrt(4913) ≈70.1 roughly. Because 70.1^2 = (70 + 0.1)^2 = 70^2 + 2*70*0.1 + 0.1^2 = 4900 + 14 + 0.01 = 4914.01. So sqrt(4913) ≈70.1 - (4914.01-4913)/(2*70.1) ≈70.1 - 1.01/140.2 ≈70.1 -0.0072≈70.0928, so approximate to 70.0928.

Thus sqrt(4913)/125 ≈70.0928 /125 ≈0.56074.

Therefore, 1 - 0.56074 ≈0.43926, so approximate to 0.4393, which is ≈43.93%. So around 43.9%.

Therefore，although this is approximate, but it is precise to two decimal places: 43.88%, 43.93% are close.

But how precise do they need? Original data: 32% (possibly two significant figures). Thus, the answer should have two significant figures, that is approximately 44%.

Thus,boxed answer should be \boxed{44\%}。

But, must check if 43.88 is closer to 44% or 43.9%. 0.4388 is 43.88%, which is approximately 43.9%, but as percent with one decimal, but since the original value is 32% with no decimal, then usually answering with integer percentage, thus 44%.

But recently the problem is given to another person, perhaps not.

Alternatively, clarifying, if it's exactly (1 - (0.68)^1.5). Is 0.68 provided as exact, then writing as boxed{1 - (0.68)^{3/2}} but likely expecting the approximate 44%.

But since the user example challenges in the previous think and responses are usually precise with two decimal or so.

Alternatively，maybe the initial information is 32% within 100 minutes, which implies =⋅than previous answer if using alternative method

Wait reconsider，the problem could be that the survival time is between t to t + delta: so perhaps integrating over remaining time. But if the problem data is purely 32% chance within 100-minute decay, but with no additional distribution info, but given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, then what's the probability that it will decay within the next 150 minutes.

Wait, in this case, can't apply time scaling.

But if supposed quantum decay is in principle that there is a constant probability per unit time, so math gets to the exponential distribution. Therefore, best bet is 44%.

Hmm.

So after analyzing various approaches, the exponential model gives approximately 43.9% and 44% when rounding, which aligns with atomic decay's memoryless property. Other models like uniform give 19% but that lacks physical basis for decay processes. Therefore, the correct answer is \boxed{44\%}


**Final Answer**
The probability the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \boxed{44\%}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model since radioactive decay is typically memoryless. 

**Given:**
- Probability of decay within 100 minutes: 32% (0.32)

**Find:**
Probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

**Steps:**
1. **Determine the decay constant (λ):**
   \[
   0.32 = 1 - e^{-100\lambda} \implies e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68 \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.00385662 \text{ per minute}
   \]

2. **Calculate probability over 150 minutes using memoryless property:**
   \[
   P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t} = 1 - e^{-0.00385662 \times 150} \approx 1 - e^{-0.578493}
   \]
   \[
   \approx 1 - 0.5612 = 0.4388 \text{ or } 43.88\%
   \]

**Answer:** The probability is approximately **43.9%**. 

$\boxed{0.439}$ (or 43.9%)

Then, in case the decay follows another distribution, perhaps the problem could be modeled using another approach, but given the context, I'll proceed with the exponential model.

Thus, the decay probability is approximately 43.9% over the next 150 minutes given it survived the first 50 minutes.

If it\'s not exponential, perhaps the half-life (T_1/2) is the information. Yet, we\'re given a 32% chance in 100 minutes, which isn\'t half (since half would coincide with T_1/2\'s 50% decay). Wait, perhaps using the decay formula:\n\nN(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T_half)\n\nBut if 32% decay in 100 minutes, meaning 68% remain, so 0.68 = (1/2)^(100 / T_half). Solving for T_half:\n\nTake the natural log: ln(0.68) = (100 / T_half) * ln(1/2)\n\nSo, T_half = 100 * ln(1/2) / ln(0.68) ≈ 100*(-0.6931)/(-0.38566) ≈ 100*(1.797) ≈ 179.7 minutes.\n\nBut here, the question is: if T_half is around 179.7 minutes, then the decay probability after time t is 1 - (1/2)^(t / T_half). Which is equivalent to the exponential model with λ = ln(2)/T_half. So indeed, the underlying physical model is same as exponential distribution. Maybe this confirms that using decay models is equivalent to the exponential distribution. Therefore, the calculation using exponential decay to determine λ is consistent.\n\nBut if we model the problem non-exponentially, such as using a uniform or another distribution, would we get the same result? If decay probability is uniform over 100 minutes: suppose the atom has a constant probability density of decay over 0 to T minutes, leading to 32% probability within 100 minutes. In that case, T is determined by pdf f(t) = 1/T, when T is the maximum lifetime. Then the probability of decay before t is 1/T * t for t ≤ T. Given that up to t = 100, probability 32%, then 1/T *100 = 0.32, yielding T = 100 / 0.32 ≈ 312.5 minutes. But since uniform distributions are memoryless? No, actually, uniform distributions are not memoryless. For a fixed T, the survival probability at time t is 1 - t/T. Then, conditional probability after surviving 50 minutes is (T - 50). Wait: if not decayed by 50 minutes, probability of decay in next 150 minutes is [ (probability of decay before 200 minutes) minus (probability decay before 50 minutes) ] divided by (probability survived 50 minutes).\n\nSo in total, the conditional probability is [ (1 - (1 - (200)/T) ) - (1 - (1 - 50/T) ) ] / (1 - 50/T ) ), but wait let me make this accurate.\n\nSince in the uniform model up to T = 312.5 minutes: CDF F(t) = t / T for t ≤ T.\n\nThen after surviving 50 minutes, the conditional probability to decay in the next 150 minutes (i.e., by 200 minutes) is [ F(200) - F(50) ] / [1 - F(50) ].\n\nCompute F(50) = 50/312.5 = 0.16, F(200) = 200/312.5 = 0.64, so the difference is 0.64 - 0.16 = 0.48; divide by 1 - 0.16 = 0.84, resulting in 0.48 / 0.84 ≈ 0.5714 or 57.14%.\n\nBut since the problem had same data (32% in 100 minutes), but the answer can be different if underlying models differ. Wait, so problem is ambiguous if we don’t know model. Thus, the user here either 1) provides that the decay must be exponential as per standard, so answer would be approx 43.88%, or 2) another model might give different results. The question is tricky because if we don’t state the underlying model assumptions, the answer isn\'t unique. But since atomic/nuclear decay is typically modeled as exponential, per quantum processes, I should proceed with exponential assumption. However, the problem says "the decay probability" within 100 minutes is 32%—just restates the CDF. If we assume the CDF at 100 min is 32%, then whether it\'s through exponential decay or another distribution? If it\'s via an exponential model, the answer is 43.88%, as before. Otherwise, in the uniform model leading to the same 32%, answer is different.\n\nBut the question is perhaps supposed to reference the memorylessness? Because if passed the 50 minutes, remaining. So wait if we can do another computation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even a gamma distribution or other? Let\'s check.\n\nWait, another alternative analysis: Given that the probability of decaying within 100 minutes is 32%, so from t = 0 to 100, probability 0.32. So if the atom has survived 50 minutes, what is the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. If at t=50, wanting to find probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes.\n\nAssuming decay is memoryless, that\'s equivalent to the original process. So if it\'s exponential, the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So, perhaps they can rephrase as desire to compute P(T <= 200 | T >50) = [P(50 < T <=200)] / P(T>50) = [F(200) - F(50)] / [1 - F(50)].\n\nBut given that with F(100) = 0.32. Since we do not know the full distribution yet. But if the decay is exponential, F(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So F(200) is 1 - e^(-λ*200), but as noted earlier, to link it. Let me structure this as:\n\nAssume F(t) = 0.32 at t=100. So F(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Then, 0.32 =1 - e^(-λ*100), so e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → λ= -ln(0.68)/100. So to find F(200)=1 - e^(-λ*200)=1 - (e^(-λ*100))^2 =1 - (0.68)^2≈1-0.4624≈0.5376. Similarly, F(50) = 1 - e^(-λ*50) =1 - (e^(-λ*100))^(0.5)=1 - sqrt(0.68)≈1 -0.8246≈0.1754.\n\nTherefore, [F(200) - F(50)] / [1 - F(50)] ≈(0.5376 - 0.1754)/(1 - 0.1754)≈0.3622/0.8246≈0.44, i.e., 44%.\n\nThis coincides with our first solution. Alternatively, in the case of exponential distribution, memorylessness gives us P(T > 200 | T > 50) = P(T > 150), since the remaining time after 50 minutes is still exponential. Then P(decay in next 150 | survived 50) is 1 - P(T>150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). Which we previously calculated as approx43.88%, again aligning with we have. Hence, this is consistent. However, essentially:\n\nWith λ calculated such that P(T<=100)=0.32, gives:\n\nThen P(T<=t)=1 - (0.68)^(t/100). Because:\n\nSince e^(-λ* t)= e^{ (ln(0.68)/100)*t } = (e^{ln(0.68)})^(t/100) = 0.68^(t/100)\n\nHence, in the decay process in terms of half-life, equivalence here with base 0.68. Hence, P(T<=t)=1 -0.68^(t/100)\n\nThen to compute at t=200 minutes, after 50 minutes:\n\nThe conditional probability would be:\n\n[P(decaying at 200) - P(decaying at 50)] / P(not decayed at 50) = [ (1 - 0.68^(200/100)) - (1 - 0.68^(50/100)) ] / (0.68^(50/100))\n\nCompute:\n\nNumerator: (1 - 0.68^2) - (1 - 0.68^0.5) = (1 -0.4624) - (1 -0.8246)≈0.5376 -0.1754≈0.3622\n\nDenominator: 0.68^0.5≈0.8246\n\nThus, (0.3622)/(0.8246)=~0.44, so about 44%\n\nAlternatively, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, one might instead think that since we know the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%, can we exponentiate it? For instance, if the survival over 100 minutes is 68%, perhaps over 50 minutes, it is (0.68)^(50/100) ≈sqrt(0.68)≈0.8246 as above. Then over 150 minutes, it would be (0.68)^(150/100) =0.68^(1.5)=0.68*sqrt(0.68)≈0.68*0.8246≈0.561, leading to decay probability as 1 -0.561≈0.439≈43.9%\n\nThus we come again to same conclusion. Therefore, under the assumption that this is an exponential process, the answer is ~43.9%, which rounds neatly to 44%. But other methods, such as the uniform distribution model, gave about 57%. Therefore there\'s a potential ambiguity here, which I should address.\n\nThe key point is the problem states that it\'s a decay of a single atom, so QM process. Then, per quantum mechanics, the decay is memoryless and follows the exponential distribution. Hence, the answer is approx 43.9%. Hence, it is proper for the user\'s problem to frame the answer in the context of exponential decay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps phrased as follows: Given that the single-atom decay probability within 100 minutes is p=32%, we can model the average decay rate since for a single atom, it\'s a Poisson process (constant risk). Therefore, the time until decay is exponential. Then, moving forward with the solution. Given that after the first 50 minutes with no decay, the survival process is equivalent to starting fresh, i.e., the remaining time is still exponential with same parameter. Hence, the probability of decay in 150 minutes after the 50 is:\n\np = 1 - (probability of surviving 150 minutes). Since the decay follows exponential distribution with F(t) =1 - e^{-λ*t}, we\'ve already characterized λ based on the p=32% at t=100 minutes. Hence \\lambda= ???, doing as: 32% decay by t=100: σ=100, p=0.32. Solving 1 - e^{- \\lambda *100}=0.32 ⇒ λ = -ln(1-0.32)/100 = -ln(0.68)/100. So, analogous to previous line.\n\nThus,p(decay in next 150 minutes) is1 - e^{-λ *150}=1 - e^{150 * ln(0.68)/100}=0.68^(150/100)=1 - 0.68^1.5\n\nCalculating 0.68^1.5:\n\nFirst, compute 0.68^1 =0.68,\n\n0.68^0.5≈0.8246, so 0.68^1.5=0.68 *0.8246≈0.561\n\nHence, p≈ 1 -0.561≈0.439, which ≈43.9%.\n\nThe answer is appropriately 44%, given possible rounding.\n\nHence, after thoroughly considering uniform vs. exponential model, where QM necessitates the latter, the conclusion should be ~43.9%, approximately 43.9% or precise value.\n\nAlternatively, presenter may accept approximate 44% as in exams. Hence, the required answer is \\boxed{44\\%}.\n\nBut wait clarification—should probabilities in exams express as fractions? Suppose the answer should be represented with decimal place or if in % is okay.\n\nBut let me check for another potential viewpoint. Suppose the question uses a non-memoryless distribution. With the given data set, possible use of conditional probability formula only on given probabilities.\n\nWait, that\'s another ambiguity. Suppose that apart from knowing that in 100 minutes, decay probability is 32%, have no other info.\n\nIs the process required, then, to use non-parametric statistics just the given information? That is, given the atom has survived 50 minutes, and that the original decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, what is the probability decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\nIn this case, known decay in 100 minutes is 32%, but survival to 50 minutes may not be known unless can assumes uniform?\n\nAlternatively, within the 100 minutes, but atom\'s decay probability is not shaped by exponential—if the process density is the same probability at any time. But in reality, in physical decay models it\'s exponential, but from the problem we\'re to take solely at fact 32% per 100 mins. What method is actually mathematically and statistically correct here?\n\nIf the question gives only two crucial points: P(T ≤100) = 0.32. And we need to compute P(T ≤200 | T >50).\n\nBut without knowledge of the distribution, difficult to analytically compute. But, in real life (if an exam proof question), thinking with the information given, perhaps using the concept of conditional probability.\n\nSo P(T ≤ 200 | T>50) = [P(50 < T ≤200)] / P(T >50)\n\nWe are told P(T ≤100) = 0.32.\n\nBut we need the missing information P(50 < T ≤200). But unless we know distribution.\n\nBut assuming that time intervals up to 100 minutes is known (as in Q\'s given) , but T=200 is beyond given data. So if we use no model, this is unanswerable, but only if CDF known multiple points. Hence again forced to use another assumption (exponential) because that models single param uniquely from single observation. Alternatively unreasonable. Alternatively, imagine that after the 100 minutes—if the decay cannot take longer than 100 minutes (it\'s bounded). But this isn\'t suggested; 0.32 probability within 100 minutes, but 68% particles in whole universe still not decay?

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

We need to determine the probability that an atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay probability within 100 minutes is known to be 32%.

### Key Steps:

1. **Exponential Decay Model**:
   - Radioactive decay is typically modeled using an exponential distribution, which is memoryless.
   - The probability of decay within time \( t \) is given by \( P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t} \).

2. **Determine Decay Constant \( \lambda \)**:
   - Given \( P(100) = 0.32 \), solve for \( \lambda \):
     \[
     0.32 = 1 - e^{-100\lambda} \implies e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68 \implies \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \text{ per minute}
     \]

3. **Probability of Decay in Next 150 Minutes**:
   - Using the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability from time 0 to 150 minutes:
     \[
     P(150) = 1 - e^{-150\lambda} \implies 1 - e^{-150 \times 0.0038566}
     \]
   - Calculate the exponent:
     \[
     150 \times 0.0038566 \approx 0.5785
     \]
   - Compute the result:
     \[
     P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.5785} \approx 1 - 0.5612 \approx 0.4388 \approx 43.88\%
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Rounding to the nearest whole number, the probability is approximately 44%.

### Final Answer:
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \boxed{44\%}.

But there's another thought. If it's not exponential, perhaps the half-life (T_1/2) is the information. Yet, we're given a 32% chance in 100 minutes, which isn't half (since half would coincide with T_1/2's 50% decay). Wait, perhaps using the decay formula:

N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T_half)

But if 32% decay in 100 minutes, meaning 68% remain, so 0.68 = (1/2)^(100 / T_half). Solving for T_half:

Take the natural log: ln(0.68) = (100 / T_half) * ln(1/2)

So, T_half = 100 * ln(1/2) / ln(0.68) ≈ 100*(-0.6931)/(-0.38566) ≈ 100*(1.797) ≈ 179.7 minutes.

But here, the question is: if T_half is around 179.7 minutes, then the decay probability after time t is 1 - (1/2)^(t / T_half). Which is equivalent to the exponential model with λ = ln(2)/T_half. So indeed, the underlying physical model is same as exponential distribution. Maybe this confirms that using decay models is equivalent to the exponential distribution. Therefore, the calculation using exponential decay to determine λ is consistent.

But if we model the problem non-exponentially, such as using a uniform or another distribution, would we get the same result? If decay probability is uniform over 100 minutes: suppose the atom has a constant probability density of decay over 0 to T minutes, leading to 32% probability within 100 minutes. In that case, T is determined by pdf f(t) = 1/T, when T is the maximum lifetime. Then the probability of decay before t is 1/T * t for t ≤ T. Given that up to t = 100, probability 32%, then 1/T *100 = 0.32, yielding T = 100 / 0.32 ≈ 312.5 minutes. But since uniform distributions are memoryless? No, actually, uniform distributions are not memoryless. For a fixed T, the survival probability at time t is 1 - t/T. Then, conditional probability after surviving 50 minutes is (T - 50). Wait: if not decayed by 50 minutes, probability of decay in next 150 minutes is [ (probability of decay before 200 minutes) minus (probability decay before 50 minutes) ] divided by (probability survived 50 minutes).

So in total, the conditional probability is [ (1 - (1 - (200)/T) ) - (1 - (1 - 50/T) ) ] / (1 - 50/T ) ), but wait let me make this accurate.

Since in the uniform model up to T = 312.5 minutes: CDF F(t) = t / T for t ≤ T.

Then after surviving 50 minutes, the conditional probability to decay in the next 150 minutes (i.e., by 200 minutes) is [ F(200) - F(50) ] / [1 - F(50) ].

Compute F(50) = 50/312.5 = 0.16, F(200) = 200/312.5 = 0.64, so the difference is 0.64 - 0.16 = 0.48; divide by 1 - 0.16 = 0.84, resulting in 0.48 / 0.84 ≈ 0.5714 or 57.14%.

But since the problem had same data (32% in 100 minutes), but the answer can be different if underlying models differ. Wait, so problem is ambiguous if we don’t know model. Thus, the user here either 1) provides that the decay must be exponential as per standard, so answer would be approx 43.88%, or 2) another model might give different results. The question is tricky because if we don’t state the underlying model assumptions, the answer isn't unique. But since atomic/nuclear decay is typically modeled as exponential, per quantum processes, I should proceed with exponential assumption. However, the problem says "the decay probability" within 100 minutes is 32%—just restates the CDF. If we assume the CDF at 100 min is 32%, then whether it's through exponential decay or another distribution? If it's via an exponential model, the answer is 43.88%, as before. Otherwise, in the uniform model leading to the same 32%, answer is different.

But the question is perhaps supposed to reference the memorylessness? Because if passed the 50 minutes, remaining. So wait if we can do another computation.

Alternatively, maybe even a gamma distribution or other? Let's check.

Wait, another alternative analysis: Given that the probability of decaying within 100 minutes is 32%, so from t = 0 to 100, probability 0.32. So if the atom has survived 50 minutes, what is the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. If at t=50, wanting to find probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes.

Assuming decay is memoryless, that's equivalent to the original process. So if it's exponential, the conditional probability is the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So, perhaps they can rephrase as desire to compute P(T <= 200 | T >50) = [P(50 < T <=200)] / P(T>50) = [F(200) - F(50)] / [1 - F(50)].

But given that with F(100) = 0.32. Since we do not know the full distribution yet. But if the decay is exponential, F(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So F(200) is 1 - e^(-λ*200), but as noted earlier, to link it. Let me structure this as:

Assume F(t) = 0.32 at t=100. So F(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Then, 0.32 =1 - e^(-λ*100), so e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → λ= -ln(0.68)/100. So to find F(200)=1 - e^(-λ*200)=1 - (e^(-λ*100))^2 =1 - (0.68)^2≈1-0.4624≈0.5376. Similarly, F(50) = 1 - e^(-λ*50) =1 - (e^(-λ*100))^(0.5)=1 - sqrt(0.68)≈1 -0.8246≈0.1754.

Therefore, [F(200) - F(50)] / [1 - F(50)] ≈(0.5376 - 0.1754)/(1 - 0.1754)≈0.3622/0.8246≈0.44, i.e., 44%.

This coincides with our first solution. Alternatively, in the case of exponential distribution, memorylessness gives us P(T > 200 | T > 50) = P(T > 150), since the remaining time after 50 minutes is still exponential. Then P(decay in next 150 | survived 50) is 1 - P(T>150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). Which we previously calculated as approx43.88%, again aligning with we have. Hence, this is consistent. However, essentially:

With λ calculated such that P(T<=100)=0.32, gives:

Then P(T<=t)=1 - (0.68)^(t/100). Because:

Since e^(-λ* t)= e^{ (ln(0.68)/100)*t } = (e^{ln(0.68)})^(t/100) = 0.68^(t/100)

Hence, in the decay process in terms of half-life, equivalence here with base 0.68. Hence, P(T<=t)=1 -0.68^(t/100)

Then to compute at t=200 minutes, after 50 minutes:

The conditional probability would be:

[P(decaying at 200) - P(decaying at 50)] / P(not decayed at 50) = [ (1 - 0.68^(200/100)) - (1 - 0.68^(50/100)) ] / (0.68^(50/100))

Compute:

Numerator: (1 - 0.68^2) - (1 - 0.68^0.5) = (1 -0.4624) - (1 -0.8246)≈0.5376 -0.1754≈0.3622

Denominator: 0.68^0.5≈0.8246

Thus, (0.3622)/(0.8246)=~0.44, so about 44%

Alternatively, same as before.

Alternatively, one might instead think that since we know the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%, can we exponentiate it? For instance, if the survival over 100 minutes is 68%, perhaps over 50 minutes, it is (0.68)^(50/100) ≈sqrt(0.68)≈0.8246 as above. Then over 150 minutes, it would be (0.68)^(150/100) =0.68^(1.5)=0.68*sqrt(0.68)≈0.68*0.8246≈0.561, leading to decay probability as 1 -0.561≈0.439≈43.9%

Thus we come again to same conclusion. Therefore, under the assumption that this is an exponential process, the answer is ~43.9%, which rounds neatly to 44%. But other methods, such as the uniform distribution model, gave about 57%. Therefore there's a potential ambiguity here, which I should address.

The key point is the problem states that it's a decay of a single atom, so QM process. Then, per quantum mechanics, the decay is memoryless and follows the exponential distribution. Hence, the answer is approx 43.9%. Hence, it is proper for the user's problem to frame the answer in the context of exponential decay.

Alternatively, perhaps phrased as follows: Given that the single-atom decay probability within 100 minutes is p=32%, we can model the average decay rate since for a single atom, it's a Poisson process (constant risk). Therefore, the time until decay is exponential. Then, moving forward with the solution. Given that after the first 50 minutes with no decay, the survival process is equivalent to starting fresh, i.e., the remaining time is still exponential with same parameter. Hence, the probability of decay in 150 minutes after the 50 is:

p = 1 - (probability of surviving 150 minutes). Since the decay follows exponential distribution with F(t) =1 - e^{-λ*t}, we've already characterized λ based on the p=32% at t=100 minutes. Hence \lambda= ???, doing as: 32% decay by t=100: σ=100, p=0.32. Solving 1 - e^{- \lambda *100}=0.32 ⇒ λ = -ln(1-0.32)/100 = -ln(0.68)/100. So, analogous to previous line.

Thus,p(decay in next 150 minutes) is1 - e^{-λ *150}=1 - e^{150 * ln(0.68)/100}=0.68^(150/100)=1 - 0.68^1.5

Calculating 0.68^1.5:

First, compute 0.68^1 =0.68,

0.68^0.5≈0.8246, so 0.68^1.5=0.68 *0.8246≈0.561

Hence, p≈ 1 -0.561≈0.439, which ≈43.9%.

The answer is appropriately 44%, given possible rounding.

Hence, after thoroughly considering uniform vs. exponential model, where QM necessitates the latter, the conclusion should be ~43.9%, approximately 43.9% or precise value.

Alternatively, presenter may accept approximate 44% as in exams. Hence, the required answer is \boxed{44\%}.

But wait clarification—should probabilities in exams express as fractions? Suppose the answer should be represented with decimal place or if in % is okay.

But let me check for another potential viewpoint. Suppose the question uses a non-memoryless distribution. With the given data set, possible use of conditional probability formula only on given probabilities.

Wait, that's another ambiguity. Suppose that apart from knowing that in 100 minutes, decay probability is 32%, have no other info.

Is the process required, then, to use non-parametric statistics just the given information? That is, given the atom has survived 50 minutes, and that the original decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, what is the probability decay in the next 150 minutes.

In this case, known decay in 100 minutes is 32%, but survival to 50 minutes may not be known unless can assumes uniform?

Alternatively, within the 100 minutes, but atom's decay probability is not shaped by exponential—if the process density is the same probability at any time. But in reality, in physical decay models it's exponential, but from the problem we're to take solely at fact 32% per 100 mins. What method is actually mathematically and statistically correct here?

If the question gives only two crucial points: P(T ≤100) = 0.32. And we need to compute P(T ≤200 | T >50).

But without knowledge of the distribution, difficult to analytically compute. But, in real life (if an exam proof question), thinking with the information given, perhaps using the concept of conditional probability.

So P(T ≤ 200 | T>50) = [P(50 < T ≤200)] / P(T >50)

We are told P(T ≤100) = 0.32.

But we need the missing information P(50 < T ≤200). But unless we know distribution.

But assuming that time intervals up to 100 minutes is known (as in Q's given) , but T=200 is beyond given data. So if we use no model, this is unanswerable, but only if CDF known multiple points. Hence again forced to use another assumption (exponential) because that models single param uniquely from single observation. Alternatively unreasonable. Alternatively, imagine that after the 100 minutes—if the decay cannot take longer than 100 minutes (it's bounded). But this isn't suggested; 0.32 probability within 100 minutes, but 68% particles in whole universe still not decay? More the case that practical T is up to infinite, hence implying an exponential distribution.

Therefore thinking step by step naturally leads to the conclusion that exponential is the way.

To sum up:

Using the exponential decay model:

1. Calculate λ from P(100) = 0.32
2. Compute remaining moments (t=150)
3. Utilizing memoryless property (already steps 50 minutes survived: disappear; instead model with λ the same decay rate)

Therefore, the probability is approximately 43.9%, leading to 44% as the answer presented. Thus after passing through multifaceted analysis, answer is 44%.

**Final Answer**
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \boxed{44\%}.
