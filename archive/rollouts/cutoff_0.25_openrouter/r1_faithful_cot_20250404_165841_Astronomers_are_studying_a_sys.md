# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3) with circular orbits discovered through the TTV method. They have found that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 2.3. They have also found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?

Given the problem of determining the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we start by analyzing the equilibrium temperature ratios and their relationship to the distances from the star. 

The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is given by:
\[ T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}} \]
where \( D \) is the distance from the star. 

From the given temperature ratios:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \) implies \( \frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \)
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \) implies \( \frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \)

Combining these distance ratios:
\[ D_3 = D_1 \times 1.96 \times 5.29 = D_1 \times 10.3684 \]

Using Kepler's Third Law, which states \( P^2 \propto D^3 \), we find the orbital period ratio:
\[ \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \right)^{3/2} \]

Substituting the distance ratio:
\[ \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2} \]

Calculating the cube of the square root of 10.3684:
\[ \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \]
\[ (3.22)^3 \approx 33.4 \]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of:
\[
\boxed{33.4}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I have this problem about planets and their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. Hmm, let me see how to approach this.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star and its distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is given by T = [ (L * (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), and presumably the same star, L and σ are constants. So the key variable affecting the temperature would be the distance D.

Given that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, that means T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. I need to connect these temperature ratios to their distances from the star because once I know the distances, I can use Kepler's third law to relate the orbital periods.

From the temperature formula, if we take the ratio of two temperatures, say T1 and T2, it would be (T1/T2) = [ (D2 / D1)² ]^(1/4) ) because temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of distance. Wait, let me make sure. Since T ∝ (1/D²)^(1/4) = D^(-1/2). Therefore, T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2).

So, if T1/T2 = 1.4, then (D2/D1)^(1/2) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, D2/D1 = (1.4)² = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, for T2/T3 = 2.3, which would imply (D3/D2)^(1/2) = 2.3, so D3/D2 = (2.3)² = 5.29, hence D3 = 5.29 * D2. But wait, let's check the direction. The ratio T2/T3 = 2.3, so T2 is hotter than T3? Wait, higher temperature means closer to the star, right? So if T2 is hotter than T3, D3 must be farther, which is consistent with D3 being larger. Yeah, because if D3 is larger, then the temperature is lower. So the way I derived D3/D2 would mean D3 is larger than D2, which is true.

Wait, actually, the formula is T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So if T2 is higher (hotter) than T3, D2 must be smaller than D3. But according to T2/T3 = 2.3, plugging into the formula (D3/D2)^(1/2) = T2/T3, so sqrt(D3/D2) = T2/T3 = 2.3. So D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29, so D3 = 5.29 * D2. Yes, D3 is 5.29 times D2. Which would place Planet3 further out, being colder. That seems right.

So, in total, Planet2 is at D2 = 1.96 * D1. Planet3 is at D3 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1. Let me compute that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let me approximate 5 * 2 is 10, and 0.29*1.96≈0.5684, so approx 10 + 0.5684 = 10.5684. But exact calculation:

1.96 * 5.29:

First multiply 1 * 5.29 = 5.29

Then 0.96 * 5.29: 5 * 5.29 = 26.45, 0.45*5.29=2.3805, so 0.96*5.29 = 5.29 - 0.04*5.29 = 5.29 - 0.2116 = 5.0784. Then total D3/D1 is 5.29 + 5.0784 = 10.3684. Wait, no. Wait hold on.

No:

Wait, 5.29 * 1.96.

Let me actually compute 5.29 × 1.96 correctly:

First: 5 * 1.96 = 9.8

Then 0.29 * 1.96: 0.2*1.96=0.392, 0.09*1.96=0.1764, so total is 0.392 + 0.1764 = 0.5684. Therefore, total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So D3 = 10.3684 * D1. Therefore, the distance from the star for Planet3 is about 10.3684 times that of Planet1.

Now, given that orbital period is related to distance by Kepler's third law, which states that P² ∝ D³ (where P is the orbital period and D is the semi-major axis, which in this case is the same as the distance since orbits are circular). The exact formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * D³. Since all planets are orbiting the same star, the mass M (stellar mass) is the same, the proportionality constant is the same for all planets. Therefore, P ∝ D^(3/2). Therefore, if D3 = 10.3684 * D1, then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

First, let's compute 10.3684^(1/2). That's sqrt(10.3684). Let's see. 3.2² = 10.24, so sqrt(10.3684) is a little more. Let me calculate 3.2² = 10.24. The difference is 10.3684 - 10.24 = 0.1284. So, we can use linear approximation. Let me think. However, perhaps an exact calculation isn't necessary here, given the problem statement uses approximate ratios. Let me check in the problem: ratios of temperatures and masses are approximate, so maybe you can use approximate factors here.

Alternatively, since when we do the final calculation, I can leave it in formula terms. But let me compute this directly.

First, (D3/D1) = 10.3684. Therefore, the ratio of orbital periods (P3/P1) is (10.3684)^(3/2). Let me compute that. 10.3684 to the power of 3/2 is (sqrt(10.3684))^3.

We can do sqrt(10.3684) ≈ 3.22, since 3.2² = 10.24, 3.22² = 10.3684. Yes, (3.22)² is (3 + 0.22)^2 = 9 + 1.32 + 0.0484 = 10.3684. Exactly. So sqrt(10.3684) = 3.22.

Thus, P3/P1 = (3.22)^3. Let's calculate that:

3.22 × 3.22 × 3.22.

First, compute 3.22³.

3.22² = 10.3684, as we saw before. Then, 10.3684 × 3.22.

First compute 10 × 3.22 = 32.2

Then 0.3684 × 3.22. Let's compute 0.3 × 3.22 = 0.966, 0.0684 × 3.22 = approx 0.0684 *3 = 0.2052, 0.0684*0.22=0.015048. Total: 0.2052 +0.015048=0.220248. Then 0.966 +0.220248=1.186248.

Thus total for 0.3684 ×3.22 ≈ 1.186248

Therefore, total 10.3684 ×3.22≈32.2 +1.186248≈33.386.

Therefore, P3/P1 ≈33.386. So approximately 33.4.

But wait, the answer is supposed to be an exact factor, but considering all given data are approximate (1.4, 2.3, 1.15, 1.35). However, the question mentions that we need to find the factor by which P3 is larger than P1, given the albedos are 0.3, the temperature ratios, and mass ratios.

Wait, but in our calculation above, we only used the temperature ratios to determine distance ratios. The mass ratios perhaps don't affect the orbital period, right? Because the orbital period in Kepler's law is solely determined by the semi-major axis (distance) and the mass of the star, not the planet's mass.

So why is the mass ratio given? Was mass ratio data extra, or am I missing something?

Wait, this is a TTV planet discovery method. TTV is transit timing variation, which is used to infer the presence of other planets by looking at variations in the transit times of a known transiting planet due to gravitational interactions with other planets. The mass of the planets can affect the TTVs. But here, understanding if we need mass for equilibrium temperature.

But equilibrium temperature is related to the distance from the star and the albedo, which is given. Maybe the mass ratios are given to perhaps infer if they would contribute to the orbital period? But Kepler's third law is independent of the planet's mass when M_planet is much smaller than M_star, which is generally the case. Unless they have significant mass, which is possible, but the problem says exoplanets, so unless they are in a binary star system or something. But typically, Kepler's law is P² = 4π²/(G(M_star + M_planet)) *a³. If M_planet is << M_star, then negligible, but even if comparable, but the problem only gives the mass ratios between planets. If the planet masses were relevant, unless it's about deriving the distance ratio, but I don't think so.

Wait, possibly the mass ratios are given to determine something else? Maybe density, radii, but I need equilibrium temperature, which can also depend on radius? Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_eq = [ (L_bol * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4)

This formula assumes that the planet radiates as a black body and is in thermal equilibrium, so it depends only on the stellar luminosity, the distance, and the albedo.

Therefore, unless the formula was considering internal heat from the planet (which for Earth's equilibrium temperature is negligible), but they say "equilibrium temperature", which generally means the temperature due to stellar radiation.

Therefore, I think that in this problem, the mass ratios are actually given for no reason? Because the question seems to be answerable with just the temperature ratios.

But the problem says "if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3", so that we know that we can use the temperature ratios to get distance ratios. Since albedo is same, so a cancels in the ratio. However, in TTV method, generally you can infer masses and orbital periods. But perhaps this problem is mixing the concepts. For example, need to use some relation that involves TTV (transit timing variations). In TTV, the variations are caused by gravitational perturbations from other planets. The strength of the TTV signal depends on the mass of the perturbing planet and the orbital period ratio. But the problem says they were discovered through TTV method, so maybe the orbital periods and masses relate via TTV.

But maybe in this problem, just standard Kepler's third law applies. So only using temperatures to get distances, then Kepler's law to get periods. If that's the case, then mass ratios maybe are a red herring? But given that the problem includes mass ratios (1.15 and 1.35), maybe they affect some other component?

Wait, suppose they have masses in some relation. For instance, maybe the problem is wanting us to use the mass of the planets to determine the densities using Kepler's law? Or perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps mistaking between the Mass-Luminosity relation of stars? But no, here the star's L is same for all planets, so it cancels out in the temperature ratios.

Wait, maybe if equilibrium temperature ratio required knowing the star's luminosity, but if we consider that. So T1/T2 = [ ( (L * (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D1²) ) / ( (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D2²) ) ]^(1/4) ) simplifies to (D2²/D1²)^(-1/4)= (D1/D2)^1/2.

Wait, another possible way is: if they have different masses, maybe that implies the denser planet is closer to the star? However, in actuality, it's possible but not part of the equilibrium temperature consideration. Wait, maybe it's the radius. But since TTV can give information about mass, which combined with radius gives density. But in the formula of equilibrium temperature, the radius is not considered? Wait.

Hold on, I might need to check. The equilibrium temperature equation is actually:

T_eq = ( L_bol (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²) )^(1/4)

Assuming the planet is a blackbody radiator, so radius is not in the formula. However, in reality, radius affects the surface gravity or the Bond albedo, but the problem specifies that albedo is same for all three.

Thus, mass ratios make me confused here. Unless the problem was intended for another effect.

Another thought: when you have multiple planets, their orbital periods can sometimes be related to gravitational interactions, which depend on their masses. But I think since the planets are discovered via TTV, which does rely on masses, but unless we have to use the fact that masses influence the TTV signal to determine the periods, which would add more complexity.

But the problem gives ratios of equilibrium temperatures and mass ratios. The question is about orbital periods, which suggests only distance is needed. So possibly, the mass ratio is a red herring given by the problem. Unless I managed to find an answer that about 33.35, but the options maybe?

But the problem specifically says answer option for the given problem. However, the user says just to provide the answer within a box.

Alternatively, the mistake is that I mixed the flux. Wait, equilibrium temperature also requires the planet's radius. Hmm.

Wait, in some references, the equilibrium temperature formula has another factor.

Wait, here's the standard formula from Wikipedia:

The effective temperature of a planet can be calculated by equating the power absorbed by the planet with the power emitted:

For a planet with albedo (a), the absorbed power is:

P_in = L_bol (1 - a) / (4 * π * D²) * π R²

Where R is planet's radius. Then the power emitted assuming black body is:

P_out = 4 π R² σ T^4

So equate P_in = P_out:

L_bol (1 - a) / (4 π D²) * π R² = 4 π R² σ T^4

Simplify: L_bol (1 - a)/(4 D²) = 4 σ T^4

Therefore, solving for T:

T^4 = L_bol (1 - a)/(16 σ D^2 )

Thus, T = [ L_bol (1 - a)/(16 σ D^2 ) ]^(1/4 )

So in that case, R_cancels out in the formula. So equilibrium temperature is independent of the planet's radius. Which makes sense, since the planet’s radius affects the cross-sectional area for absorption (π R²) and also the surface area for emission (4 π R²), which cancel if albedo is the same. Therefore, regardless of radius, the equilibrium temperature just depends on flux from star, distance, and albedo.

So, in that case, but rotation and greenhouse effects are neglected here. Therefore, the equilibirum temperature ratio only depends on distance ratios, when albedo is the same.

Therefore, mass ratios again are probably irrelevant. But problem states the ratios... Hence possibly, an error in the problem? Or maybe there's a misdirection. But given that problem mentions exoplanets discovered via TTV method. To recall, some other relations:

The TTV method relies on deviations in transit timing, which depend on the perturbing planet's mass and orbital period. The TTV signal can be approximated with the mass of the perturber and the orbital period ratio. However, perhaps one can use the mass ratio and period ratio, but the problem gives temperature ratios and mass ratios, which, to my knowledge, don't directly relate. So, being TTV detected planets, implying that mass and period can be inferred. However, within the problem, we are given the temperatures and the masses for possibly another purpose.

Alternatively, even if they give you the mass ratios, maybe if Planetary mass relates to TTV method inversion.

Hmm, back to initial thought, the answer comes from calculating P3 in terms of P1 via Kepler's third law, once we have D3/D1.

Since P² ∝ D³, and D3 is 10.3684 D1. So then (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3. Therefore, P3/P1= (D3/D1)^(3/2) ~ (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ (3.22)^3 ≈33.4.

But step by step:

D3 = 1.96 * 5.29 * D1 = 1.96 *5.29 D1 = approx 10.368 D1.

Thus, (D3/D1) =10.3684.

So P3/P1 = 10.3684 ^ (3/2) = sqrt(10.3684)^3. We found sqrt is 3.22, and 3.22^3 is 33.4.

Thus, approx 33.4.

But since some of the ratios presented in the problem are approximate, 1.4,2.3,1.15,1.35, which are possible to be exact. But maybe need fewer sig figs. But T1/T2=1.4, exactly 1.4, T2/T3=2.3. Are these possibly exact numbers to be used exactly, such that temperature ratio = sqrt(distance ratio), so D3 is (2.3)^2 * (1.4)^2 D1?

Wait, let's step through temperature ratios again.

Known: T1/T2=1.4; T2/T3=2.3. From each, implies D2/D1=(T1/T2)^2=1.96; and D3/D2=(T2/T3)^2=5.29. So D3/D1=1.96*5.29= approx 10.3684 as before.

So:

Indeed, the reason KT3 gives P scales with D^(3/2), so (D3/D1) 10.3684^(3/2)=as you say, approx 33.4.

But let's check exact expression.

Instead of using approximate decimal steps, hold things as exact fractions:

Compute exact D3/D1= ( (T1/T2)^2 ) * ( (T2/T3)^2 ) = ( (1.4)^2 ) * ( (2.3)^2 )= (1.96)*(5.29)=1.96*5.29=10.3684

Thus, same as before.

So, the exponentiation in the period is to the 3/2, so answer is 10.3684^(3/2)= (10.3684)^(1.5)=33.4, as before.

But if the numbers given in the problem are assumed to be exact, then I can calculate using fractions.

Given that 1.4 is 14/10 or 7/5, and 2.3 is 23/10.

Thus:

T1/T2=7/5:

Thus, sqrt(D2/D1)=7/5 => D2/D1=(7/5)^2=49/25.

Similarly, T2/T3=23/10:

sqrt(D3/D2)=23/10; D3/D2=(23/10)^2=529/100.

Therefore, D3/D1= (49/25)*(529/100)= (49*529)/(25*100)

Compute 49*529: 49 * 500 = 24,500 and 49*29=1,421. Total is 24,500 +1,421=25,921.

Thus, D3/D1=25921/(25*100)=25921/2500=10.3684.

Again same decimal.

Thus p^3/p1= (25921/2500)^(3/2)=sqrt(25921/2500)^3. The square root of 25921/2500 is sqrt(25921)/sqrt(2500)=161/50=3.22 (since 161*161=25,921). Then, (161/50)^3=161³/50³.

Compute 161³:

161*161=25,921

25,921*161:

Let me compute step by step:

25,921 * 100 = 2,592,100

25,921 * 60 = 1,555,260

25,921 * 1 =25,921

Total: 2,592,100 +1,555,260=4,147,360; +25,921=4,173,281.

Wait, 161³=4,173,281

Compute 50³=125,000.

Thus, (161/50)^3=4,173,281 / 125,000≈ 4,173,281 ÷125,000≈33.386 indeed.

So 161 cubed is 4,173,281.

Therefore, 4,173,281 divided by 125,000.

Which is 4,173,281 ÷125,000 ≈33.386 is the exact fractional calculation.

But since the given ratios are approximated (with words like "approximately" and "about") the answer would need to be a rounded number, but possibly presented with a decimal. Even with two significant figures.

But from the prime factors:

Wait, the problem states "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4," so 1.4 which is two significant figures.

Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3.

Same with planet's mass ratios, approximately 1.15 and 1.35. But perhaps here since all the given quantities are approximate, the user wants an approximate answer?

My calculation gives 33.4 or 33.38...

But depending on the precision, probably 33 if a 'approx', but since in Temperatures we've done squared and you get D3/D1≈10.3684, which we derived from the factors, that is in context of decimal-place approximated original ratios.

Alternatively, since original T ratios are approximate (eg 1.4 and 2.3) so exactly 1.4 and 2.3.

Assume precise:

But. Is another approach.

Possibly,

If ratio given Jupiter masses would drop in, but according to the problem, we have planet mass ratios: Planet1/Planet2=1.15, Planet2/Planet3=1.35, so Planet1/Planet3=1.15*1.35=1.5525.

So the mass of Planet1 is about 1.55 times that of Planet3.

But, again, since the mass does not play into the Keplerian period (only if the star's mass is corrected by planet mass, but Planet's mass is negligible).

Alternatively, think of center of mass. But the given parameters, if anyway used, but given the answer for debris disk or something as periods, but I think the answer is obtainable as  ~33.4.

Alternatively again, does that number make sense? If a planet is 10 times further to the star than another. Solar system, Earth's orbital period is 1 year. At 10 AU, which is Saturn's orbit, whose period is about 29.7 years.

In reality, the inner solar system: Mercury at 0.38 AU, period 0.24 year. So AU^3 = P^2. So 10.3684 AU would be P = sqrt(10.3684^3)= ~33.4, which in solar system terms, would be roughly that.

Hence answer would be 33.

But according to our prior calculation, ~33.4.

But considering potential supporting the choices, perhaps is expecting an answer about this.

Given the problem in the TTV method...

Wait, but here come's problem. We need to check if albedo is necessary. Albedo is given equal to 0.3. But since the ratio of temperatures only fails to affect if albedo is different. But given they all have same albedo, so albedo cancels in the ratio. Why does the problem even mention albedo? Perhaps as a double-check? To signal that albedo is same as Earth, so their equilibrium temperature relations can be calculated using same a=0.3.

But for scaling, since albedo is same, no issue.

Another question : were L and the star’s mass the same. Are we to assume that the star is same surrounding all planets? Of course, as per problem statement: "a system of three exoplanets" implying they're orbiting same star. So star's luminosity and mass are same, so these constants can be canceled.

I don’t see any step which requires data given, the problem. Calculation is about M2/M1 and M3/M2, but since M is negligible in terms of affecting P through each other's gravity: but unless inserting stellar mass. Again but star doesn't change.

Potential answer is about 33.3, approximates to 33.4.

However, perhaps the problem will accept two significant numbers, so "33". But in the answer box, written as 33.4, but check with the data. Since original temperature ratio 1.4 and 2.3 set up D3/D1= (1.4 x 2.3)^2 = (3.22)^2=10.368^(3/2)=33.386. The problem says what factors is the orbital periods ... probably nearest integer. But since 33.4  approximate.

Alternatively, since the problem could have "by a factor" which is ~33, but possibly answer is closer to 33.5. But more!

As precise as the problem gives of mass ratios not entering, then answer is 33.4 The key is to see that in the problem's given, even though masses is mentioned, masses have nothing to do, So the answer is whether_signal word like in standardized tests, that answer here is 33.4.

Thus after careful calculation, the factor is approximately 33.4, so implying \boxed{33.4}

**Final Answer**
The orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of \boxed{33.4}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I have this problem about planets and their equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. Hmm, let me see how to approach this.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the luminosity of its star and its distance from the star. The formula for equilibrium temperature is given by T = [ (L * (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), and presumably the same star, L and σ are constants. So the key variable affecting the temperature would be the distance D.

Given that the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, that means T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. I need to connect these temperature ratios to their distances from the star because once I know the distances, I can use Kepler's third law to relate the orbital periods.

From the temperature formula, if we take the ratio of two temperatures, say T1 and T2, it would be (T1/T2) = [ (D2 / D1)² ]^(1/4) ) because temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of distance. Wait, let me make sure. Since T ∝ (1/D²)^(1/4) = D^(-1/2). Therefore, T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2).

So, if T1/T2 = 1.4, then (D2/D1)^(1/2) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, D2/D1 = (1.4)² = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, for T2/T3 = 2.3, which would imply (D3/D2)^(1/2) = 2.3, so D3/D2 = (2.3)² = 5.29, hence D3 = 5.29 * D2. But wait, let's check the direction. The ratio T2/T3 = 2.3, so T2 is hotter than T3? Wait, higher temperature means closer to the star, right? So if T2 is hotter than T3, D3 must be farther, which is consistent with D3 being larger. Yeah, because if D3 is larger, then the temperature is lower. So the way I derived D3/D2 would mean D3 is larger than D2, which is true.

Wait, actually, the formula is T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So if T2 is higher (hotter) than T3, D2 must be smaller than D3. But according to T2/T3 = 2.3, plugging into the formula (D3/D2)^(1/2) = T2/T3, so sqrt(D3/D2) = T2/T3 = 2.3. So D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29, so D3 = 5.29 * D2. Yes, D3 is 5.29 times D2. Which would place Planet3 further out, being colder. That seems right.

So, in total, Planet2 is at D2 = 1.96 * D1. Planet3 is at D3 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1. Let me compute that: 5.29 * 1.96. Let me approximate 5 * 2 is 10, and 0.29*1.96≈0.5684, so approx 10 + 0.5684 = 10.5684. But exact calculation:

1.96 * 5.29:

First multiply 1 * 5.29 = 5.29

Then 0.96 * 5.29: 5 * 5.29 = 26.45, 0.45*5.29=2.3805, so 0.96*5.29 = 5.29 - 0.04*5.29 = 5.29 - 0.2116 = 5.0784. Then total D3/D1 is 5.29 + 5.0784 = 10.3684. Wait, no. Wait hold on.

No:

Wait, 5.29 * 1.96.

Let me actually compute 5.29 × 1.96 correctly:

First: 5 * 1.96 = 9.8

Then 0.29 * 1.96: 0.2*1.96=0.392, 0.09*1.96=0.1764, so total is 0.392 + 0.1764 = 0.5684. Therefore, total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So D3 = 10.3684 * D1. Therefore, the distance from the star for Planet3 is about 10.3684 times that of Planet1.

Now, given that orbital period is related to distance by Kepler's third law, which states that P² ∝ D³ (where P is the orbital period and D is the semi-major axis, which in this case is the same as the distance since orbits are circular). The exact formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * D³. Since all planets are orbiting the same star, the mass M (stellar mass) is the same, the proportionality constant is the same for all planets. Therefore, P ∝ D^(3/2). Therefore, if D3 = 10.3684 * D1, then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

First, let's compute 10.3684^(1/2). That's sqrt(10.3684). Let's see. 3.2² = 10.24, so sqrt(10.3684) is a little more. Let me calculate 3.2² = 10.24. The difference is 10.3684 - 10.24 = 0.1284. So, we can use linear approximation. Let me think. However, perhaps an exact calculation isn't necessary here, given the problem statement uses approximate ratios. Let me check in the problem: ratios of temperatures and masses are approximate, so maybe you can use approximate factors here.

Alternatively, since when we do the final calculation, I can leave it in formula terms. But let me compute this directly.

First, (D3/D1) = 10.3684. Therefore, the ratio of orbital periods (P3/P1) is (10.3684)^(3/2). Let me compute that. 10.3684 to the power of 3/2 is (sqrt(10.3684))^3.

We can do sqrt(10.3684) ≈ 3.22, since 3.2² = 10.24, 3.22² = 10.3684. Yes, (3.22)² is (3 + 0.22)^2 = 9 + 1.32 + 0.0484 = 10.3684. Exactly. So sqrt(10.3684) = 3.22.

Thus, P3/P1 = (3.22)^3. Let's calculate that:

3.22 × 3.22 × 3.22.

First, compute 3.22³.

3.22² = 10.3684, as we saw before. Then, 10.3684 × 3.22.

First compute 10 × 3.22 = 32.2

Then 0.3684 × 3.22. Let's compute 0.3 × 3.22 = 0.966, 0.0684 × 3.22 = approx 0.0684 *3 = 0.2052, 0.0684*0.22=0.015048. Total: 0.2052 +0.015048=0.220248. Then 0.966 +0.220248=1.186248.

Thus total for 0.3684 ×3.22 ≈ 1.186248

Therefore, total 10.3684 ×3.22≈32.2 +1.186248≈33.386.

Therefore, P3/P1 ≈33.386

I'm trying to solve a problem about determining the ratio of orbital periods between Planet3 and Planet1 based on their equilibrium temperatures and masses.

I recall that a planet's equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance, following the formula T = [(L * (1 - a))/(16 * π * σ * D²)]^(1/4), where L is luminosity, a is albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance. Since all planets have the same albedo (0.3) and orbit the same star, the main variable affecting temperature is distance D.

Given that T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3, I need to relate these temperature ratios to distances, which will then help me determine orbital periods.

From the temperature formula, temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of distance (T ∝ D^(-1/2)). So for temperature ratios, T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2).

With T1/T2 = 1.4, we get (D2/D1)^(1/2) = 1.4, which means D2/D1 = (1.4)² = 1.96, so D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Similarly, for T2/T3 = 2.3, we get (D3/D2)^(1/2) = 2.3, so D3/D2 = (2.3)² = 5.29, making D3 = 5.29 * D2.

This makes sense since higher temperature corresponds to being closer to the star, so the colder Planet3 should be farther away than Planet2.

Combining these results: D3 = 5.29 * D2 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1 = 10.3684 * D1.

Calculating 5.29 * 1.96:
5 * 1.96 = 9.8
0.29 * 1.96 = 0.5684
Total: 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684

According to Kepler's third law, P² ∝ D³, or P ∝ D^(3/2), where P is orbital period. Since D3 = 10.3684 * D1, the ratio of orbital periods P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

To calculate this:
First, √10.3684 ≈ 3.22 (verified: 3.22² = 10.3684)
Then P3/P1 = (3.22)³

Computing 3.22³:
3.22² = 10.3684
10.3684 * 3.22 = 33.386

Therefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.386 times larger than that of Planet1.

I have a problem involving planets' equilibrium temperatures and masses, and I'm tasked with finding by how much the orbital period of Planet3 exceeds that of Planet1. Let's explore how to address this.

Firstly, a planet's equilibrium temperature is determined by its star's luminosity and its distance from the star. The formula is T = [ (L * (1 - a)) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance. With all three planets having the same albedo (0.3) and orbiting the same star, L and σ remain constant. Thus, the significant variable here is the distance D.

Knowing the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, we have T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. These temperature ratios need to be associated with their distances, as understanding the distances allows us to utilize Kepler's third law for orbital periods.

Examining the temperature formula, the ratio of two temperatures, like T1 and T2, yields (T1/T2) = [ (D2 / D1)² ]^(1/4), because temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of distance, represented by T ∝ D^(-1/2). Hence, T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2).

With T1/T2 = 1.4, it follows that (D2/D1)^(1/2) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, D2/D1 = 1.96, which makes D2 = 1.96 * D1.

For T2/T3 = 2.3, this implies (D3/D2)^(1/2) = 2.3, so D3/D2 = 5.29, leading to D3 = 5.29 * D2. Ensuring correctness, if T2 is hotter than T3, then D3, being larger, places Planet3 farther away, consistent with being colder.

Thus, D2 = 1.96 * D1 and D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 * D1. Upon calculation, 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684, so D3 = 10.3684 * D1. Consequently, the distance from the star for Planet3 is approximately 10.3684 times that of Planet1.

Applying Kepler's third law, where P² ∝ D³, the orbit's period (P) relates to the semi-major axis, D. Since all planets orbit the same star, P ∝ D^(3/2). Therefore, if D3 = 10.3684 * D1, then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Calculating, 10.3684^(1/2) approximates to 3.22 since 3.2² = 10.24, meaning P3/P1 = (3.22)³. Computing this:

3.22³ involves first finding 3.22² = 10.3684, then multiplying 10.3684 by 3.22. Calculating:

10 × 3.22 = 32.2 and 0.3684 × 3.22 ≈ 1.186248. Thus, 10.3684 × 3.22 ≈ 33.386.

Hence, P3/P1 ≈ 33.386.

Let me check if my approximation is correct.\n\nBut wait, in reality, maybe I should check this because it\'s important for the answer. Let me cross-verify:\n\nWait, 3.22³, so 3.2*3.2=10.24, 10.24*3.2=32.768, but 3.22 is a bit more. If I take (3.2 +0.02)³, then using binomial expansion:\n\n(3.2)³ + 3*(3.2)²*(0.02) + 3*(3.2)*(0.02)^2 + (0.02)^3\n\nWhich is 32.768 + 3*10.24*0.02 + 3*3.2*0.0004 + 0.000008\n\n=32.768 + 0.6144 + 0.00384 +0.000008≈32.768 +0.6144=33.3824 +0.00384=33.38624 +0.000008≈33.38625.\n\nSo using binomial, exactly 33.38624. Which is approximately 33.39. So that\'s correct. So P3 is approximately 33.39 times longer than P1.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives relationships of masses. They have found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. If mass ratios are given, do those affect the orbital periods?\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe I need to check. Wait, normally Kepler\'s third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star: P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) * D³. However, since the planet mass m is negligible compared to the star\'s mass M (unless these are binary planets or something), which is typically the case. But the problem mentions that the orbits were discovered through TTV (Transit Timing Variations). TTV method usually implies that the planets are affecting each other\'s orbits, so their masses are significant enough to cause gravitational influences, leading to variations in transit times. In that case, can we still consider that Kepler\'s third law holds with just the star\'s mass?\n\nAlternatively, in the TTV method, the masses of the planets can be calculated based on the perturbations they cause in each other\'s orbits. But perhaps here, the problem is simplifying and assuming that the planets\' masses don\'t significantly affect the orbital periods? Hmm.\n\nWait, because the orbital period is determined primarily by the star\'s mass and the semi-major axis. However, if the planet\'s mass is significant, then it\'s actually a two-body problem where both the star and the planet orbit their mutual barycenter. But in such a case, the formula would involve the sum of the masses, i.e., P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) * a³, but here \'a\' is the semi-major axis of the planet\'s orbit around the barycenter, which is (M/(M + m)) times the semi-major axis of the planet\'s orbit around the star. Since in exoplanets, M is much larger than m, this is usually approximated as P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) * a³. Therefore, unless the planet\'s mass is a considerable fraction of the star\'s mass, which is not typical, the presence of planet mass in Kepler\'s law is negligible.\n\nGiven that the problem gives us the mass ratios of the planets, but in typical Keplerian orbits, the planet mass doesn\'t factor into the period. Thus, perhaps the mass ratios are a red herring here, and we can derive the answer just on the basis of the equilibrium temperatures? Hmm.\n\nBut let me read the question again carefully: "By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?"\n\nIt says "orbital period". If I use equilibrium temperature ratios to get distances, then use Kepler\'s third law to get the orbital period ratio. But shouldn\'t we account for the masses? Wait, no. Unless...\n\nWait, in reality, the TTV method relies on gravitational interactions between planets, which depend on their masses. Therefore, the TTV signal allows you to determine the planetary masses. However, here the problem is just stating that they\'ve discovered the planetary orbits through the TTV method, not that we have to use the mass information for any TTV calculation. The question specifically asks to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1 based on the given temperature ratios and mass ratios, given that albedo is 0.3. Wait, but the problem gives the mass ratios. So maybe there\'s some connection between the mass ratios and the orbital periods?\n\nBut Kepler\'s third law relates period to semi-major axis and the sum of the masses if it\'s a two-body problem, but in this case, I think we can ignore the planetary masses when calculating the orbital periods because they are much smaller than the star\'s mass. But why would the problem give the mass ratios then? Hmm. Maybe there\'s a different way to approach this problem? Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps they use some relation that relates mass and orbital period. For example, in some combined tidal forces or something else? Alternatively, maybe the Doppler method, where mass affects the radial velocity, but TTV is more about timing variations due to gravitational tugs. But unless we are given more data about the actual TTV signals, such as the magnitude of the timing variations, which isn\'t given here, I don\'t think we can link the planetary masses to their orbital periods. Since the question mentions "the ratio of the masses" but doesn\'t specify how it\'s related to the orbital periods, perhaps those are distractors?\n\nWait, maybe not necessarily. Let\'s check the data given again. The equilibrium temperature ratios: T1/T2 = 1.4, T2/T3=2.3. So inverting that, T3=T2/2.3 and T2=T1/1.4. Therefore, T3 = T1/(1.4*2.3) = T1/3.22.\n\nAlso, mass ratios: Planet1/Planet2 = 1.15, which I think the problem says "the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15". Do they mean M1/M2 = 1.15, or M2/M1? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check:\n\n"They have found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15". The ratio of A and B is usually A/B. So M1/M2 =1.15 and M2/M3=1.35. Hence, M1 =1.15*M2, and M2=1.35*M3. Therefore, M1 =1.15*1.35*M3=1.5525*M3.\n\nBut how do those masses affect the problem?\n\nBut equilibrium temperature depends only on the distance and star\'s luminosity and albedo, not the planet\'s mass. So perhaps the problem is not expecting you to use the mass ratios. So maybe that data is redundant, but is it a trick question where you actually do need to use the masses?\n\nWait, but let me check. If mass affects the orbital period. Wait, if you have two planets with different masses, in the same orbit, they might have different orbital periods? Wait, no. Kepler\'s third law states that the period is independent of the planet\'s mass. So even with different masses, if they\'re orbiting the same star, and at the same distance, their orbital periods are the same, which is because in the formula P² ∝ D³/(M + m), but M is the star\'s mass, so P depends just on D and M (the star\'s mass). So m is negligible.\n\nThus, mass ratios should not affect orbital periods, and so the temperature ratios are sufficient to calculate the distance ratios, hence the period ratios. Therefore, the info on mass ratios might be extraneous, just to confirm that they were indeed discovered via TTV (which does require masses to create detectable signals). But maybe the problem includes it to see if you know that masses aren\'t needed for the calculation of the orbital period, assuming they orbit the same star.\n\nThus, perhaps proceeding as before is correct.\n\nIn which case, answer is approx 33.39. But let me ensure my previous calculation is correct.\n\nT1/T2 =1.4 so (D2/D1)^(1/2) =1.4 => D2=1.96 D1.\n\nT2/T3=2.3 => (D3/D2)^(1/2)=2.3 => D3=5.29 D2.\n\nHence D3=5.29*1.96 D1 ≈10.3684 D1.\n\nKepler\'s law: P ∝ D^(3/2). Therefore, P3/P1=(10.3684)^(3/2)≈(3.22)^3≈33.39.\n\nThat\'s the answer. Since the answer is supposed to be in boxed notation, maybe 33.4 or 33, but maybe the calculation can be made more precise. However, the problem gives ratios that are approximate (1.4, 2.3, 1.15, 1.35). That suggests that we may have to use exact calculations with these numbers, but when squared, they give exact numbers. Wait, 1.4 squared is 1.96, which is exact. 2.3 squared is 5.29, which is exact. 1.15 and 1.35 when multiplied together give 1.5525, but as these are given as 1.15 and 1.35, even multiplied are precise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we are to use the exact ratios given?\n\nWait, if we track everything symbolically:\n\nGiven T1/T2 =1.4 and T2/T3=2.3.\n\nFrom the equilibrium temperature formula:\n\nT^4 ∝ 1/D² => (T1/T2)^4 = (D2/D1)^2 => (1.4)^4 = (D2/D1)^2 => D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 =1.96. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (T2/T3)^4 = (D3/D2)^2 => (2.3)^4 = (D3/D2)^2 => D3/D2=(2.3)^2 =5.29.\n\nTherefore, D3=5.29 D2=5.29 *1.96 D1=10.3684 D1.\n\nSo period P3/P1=(D3/D1)^(3/2)=(10.3684)^(3/2). As previously, which gives approximately 33.39.\n\nWhy 33.39? Wait, as 10.3684 is approximately 10.37, so, however, exact cube is 10.37*(10.37)^0.5. Wait, but sqrt(10.37) is exactly 3.22 (since 3.22 squared is 10.37). So cube is 3.22 *3.22*3.22=33.39. However, if you want to get precise value, 3.22*3.22=10.3684; then, 10.3684 *3.22:\n\n10 * 3.22 =32.2\n\n0.3684*3.22= 1.186248\n\nTotal 33.386248, which is approx 33.386. So 33.39 or 33.4 when rounded. But maybe the actual exact fractions would be cleaner.\n\nWait, considering that 1.4 is likely 14/10=7/5. 1.4 is 7/5.\n\nSimilarly, 2.3 might be 23/10.\n\nThen let me recast the D ratios in fractions.\n\nIf T1/T2=7/5, so:.\n\n(D2/D1)^(1/2)=7/5 => D2/D1 = (7/5)^2 =49/25=1.96, same as before.\n\nT2/T3=23/10, so (D3/D2)^(1/2)=23/10, => D3/D2=(23/10)^2=529/100=5.29.\n\nTherefore, D3=529/100 * D2=529/100 *49/25 D1=(529*49)/(100*25) D1.\n\nMultiply numerators:529*49. Let me compute that.\n\n529 ×49: 529×50=26450, minus 529=26450-529=25921.\n\nDenominator:100×25=2500.\n\nTherefore, D3/D1=25921/2500.\n\nTherefore, (D3/D1)^(3/2)= (25921/2500)^(3/2)= sqrt(25921/2500)^3 =(sqrt(25921)/sqrt(2500)))^3=(161/50)^3.\n\nBecause sqrt(25921)=161 (since 160²=25600, 161²=25921), and sqrt(2500)=50. Thus (161/50)^3.\n\nCalculating this:\n\nFirst, 161^3: 161*161=25921, then 25921*161.\n\nNot so fun to compute, but we can note that:\n\n161 * 161 = (160 +1)^2 =25600 + 320 +1=25921\n\n25921*161=25921*(160+1)=25921*160 +25921*1=4147360 +25921=4173281.\n\nSimilarly, 50^3=125000. Therefore, (161/50)^3=4173281/125000=33.386248.\n\nThus, the same value as before: approximately 33.386. So boxed as \\boxed{33.4}?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives ratios as approximate (1.4, 2.3), we need to consider that they might not be exact. So maybe 1.4 is an approximate ratio implying that the answer is roughly 33. But more accurately 33.4, but since in the question it\'s mentioned "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures ... is approximately 1.4, and ... about 2.3", so the periods would be approximate as well. However, if I need to use significant figures, possibly two sig figs. 1.4 and 2.3 are two sig figs each. So 1.4 (two) leading to 1.96 (still two, as 1.4 is two), 2.3 (two) leading to 5.29 (technically three, but since original is two... but depending on how you compute). The final D3/D1 is 1.96 *5.29≈10.368, two decimal digits but original ratios have two sig figs. Therefore, D3/D1≈10 (with 1 sig fig) may be overdramatic, but 10.37 could be approximated as 10, but perhaps using the least number of sig figs, which were two. Therefore, the final calculation is (10.37)^1.5 ~33.4, which would be two sig figs:33, but since 33.386 is three sig figs.\n\nAlternatively, if 1.4 is two sig figs, and 2.3 is two sig figs, when multiplied through, the result would have two sig figs, so 33 (two sig figs)? But given that in intermediate steps, when multiplying (D3/D1) =1.96 *5.29= approximately 10.368. Since 1.96 has three sig figs (1.96 has three), and 5.29 has three (from 2.3 squared). Therefore, maybe 10.37 has three sig figs.\n\nWait, but how were they calculated? If the problem gives 1.4 as ratio (which is two sig figs), so (1.4)^2 =1.96 (so they wrote approximately 1.4, but actually provided with two sig figs).

Hmmm.\n\nAlternatively, given the question is presented in approximate terms, the answer is 33 or 33.4. Hmm.\n\nWait, given that in the problem statement all the initial ratios are given in approximate decimals (e.g., 1.4, 2.3, 1.15, 1.35) which is up to three significant figures (e.g., 1.15, 1.35 = three; 1.4,2.3=two). However, when squaring 1.4 (1.4^2=1.96) which is more accurately two sig figs, though 1.96 is three. It\'s maybe confusing.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if the answer requires using the given values exactly as written without approximating in between, to multiply the temperature ratios as per the formula to get the distance ratio.\n\nSo, T1/T2 = 1.4 , so (D2/D1) = (T1/T2)^2 =1.4^2=1.96.\n\nSimilarly, T2/T3=2.3, so (D3/D2)=(T2/T3)^2=2.3^2=5.29.\n\nThus, D3/D1= 1.96*5.29=10.3684.\n\nThen (D3/D1)^(3/2)= (10.3684)^1.5 = approx 33.386.\n\nSince the question says "by what factor", a multiplier, so approximately this value, maybe rounded to two decimal places, but in the box you can put an exact decimal or a fractional number.

Radius is not in the formula. Because it\'s the temperature at the planet\'s surface? No, here equilibrium temperature refers to the effective temperature, which is a function of incoming flux and albedo, as (L*(1 - a)/(16 pi sigma D^2 ))^(1/4).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Given the problem of determining the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we start by using the equilibrium temperature ratios and Kepler's third law. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - The equilibrium temperature ratio \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \) implies the distance ratio \( \frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \).
   - The equilibrium temperature ratio \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \) implies the distance ratio \( \frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \).

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Combining these distances, \( D_3 = D_2 \times 5.29 = D_1 \times 1.96 \times 5.29 \).
   - Calculating the combined distance ratio, \( D_3 = D_1 \times 1.96 \times 5.29 = D_1 \times 10.3684 \).

3. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   - Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( D^{3/2} \).
   - The ratio of the orbital periods \( \frac{P_3}{P_1} \) is \( \left( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \right)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{3/2} \).

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Calculating \( (10.3684)^{3/2} \):
     - First, find the square root of 10.3684, which is 3.22.
     - Then, cube 3.22: \( 3.22^3 = 33.386 \).

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{33.4}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

. So approximately 33.39. Let me check if my approximation is correct.

But wait, in reality, maybe I should check this because it's important for the answer. Let me cross-verify:

Wait, 3.22³, so 3.2*3.2=10.24, 10.24*3.2=32.768, but 3.22 is a bit more. If I take (3.2 +0.02)³, then using binomial expansion:

(3.2)³ + 3*(3.2)²*(0.02) + 3*(3.2)*(0.02)^2 + (0.02)^3

Which is 32.768 + 3*10.24*0.02 + 3*3.2*0.0004 + 0.000008

=32.768 + 0.6144 + 0.00384 +0.000008≈32.768 +0.6144=33.3824 +0.00384=33.38624 +0.000008≈33.38625.

So using binomial, exactly 33.38624. Which is approximately 33.39. So that's correct. So P3 is approximately 33.39 times longer than P1.

But wait, the problem gives relationships of masses. They have found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35. If mass ratios are given, do those affect the orbital periods?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I need to check. Wait, normally Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star: P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) * D³. However, since the planet mass m is negligible compared to the star's mass M (unless these are binary planets or something), which is typically the case. But the problem mentions that the orbits were discovered through TTV (Transit Timing Variations). TTV method usually implies that the planets are affecting each other's orbits, so their masses are significant enough to cause gravitational influences, leading to variations in transit times. In that case, can we still consider that Kepler's third law holds with just the star's mass?

Alternatively, in the TTV method, the masses of the planets can be calculated based on the perturbations they cause in each other's orbits. But perhaps here, the problem is simplifying and assuming that the planets' masses don't significantly affect the orbital periods? Hmm.

Wait, because the orbital period is determined primarily by the star's mass and the semi-major axis. However, if the planet's mass is significant, then it's actually a two-body problem where both the star and the planet orbit their mutual barycenter. But in such a case, the formula would involve the sum of the masses, i.e., P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) * a³, but here 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the barycenter, which is (M/(M + m)) times the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star. Since in exoplanets, M is much larger than m, this is usually approximated as P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) * a³. Therefore, unless the planet's mass is a considerable fraction of the star's mass, which is not typical, the presence of planet mass in Kepler's law is negligible.

Given that the problem gives us the mass ratios of the planets, but in typical Keplerian orbits, the planet mass doesn't factor into the period. Thus, perhaps the mass ratios are a red herring here, and we can derive the answer just on the basis of the equilibrium temperatures? Hmm.

But let me read the question again carefully: "By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1, if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3 (similar to that of Earth)?"

It says "orbital period". If I use equilibrium temperature ratios to get distances, then use Kepler's third law to get the orbital period ratio. But shouldn't we account for the masses? Wait, no. Unless...

Wait, in reality, the TTV method relies on gravitational interactions between planets, which depend on their masses. Therefore, the TTV signal allows you to determine the planetary masses. However, here the problem is just stating that they've discovered the planetary orbits through the TTV method, not that we have to use the mass information for any TTV calculation. The question specifically asks to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1 based on the given temperature ratios and mass ratios, given that albedo is 0.3. Wait, but the problem gives the mass ratios. So maybe there's some connection between the mass ratios and the orbital periods?

But Kepler's third law relates period to semi-major axis and the sum of the masses if it's a two-body problem, but in this case, I think we can ignore the planetary masses when calculating the orbital periods because they are much smaller than the star's mass. But why would the problem give the mass ratios then? Hmm. Maybe there's a different way to approach this problem? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps they use some relation that relates mass and orbital period. For example, in some combined tidal forces or something else? Alternatively, maybe the Doppler method, where mass affects the radial velocity, but TTV is more about timing variations due to gravitational tugs. But unless we are given more data about the actual TTV signals, such as the magnitude of the timing variations, which isn't given here, I don't think we can link the planetary masses to their orbital periods. Since the question mentions "the ratio of the masses" but doesn't specify how it's related to the orbital periods, perhaps those are distractors?

Wait, maybe not necessarily. Let's check the data given again. The equilibrium temperature ratios: T1/T2 = 1.4, T2/T3=2.3. So inverting that, T3=T2/2.3 and T2=T1/1.4. Therefore, T3 = T1/(1.4*2.3) = T1/3.22.

Also, mass ratios: Planet1/Planet2 = 1.15, which I think the problem says "the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15". Do they mean M1/M2 = 1.15, or M2/M1? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check:

"They have found that the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15". The ratio of A and B is usually A/B. So M1/M2 =1.15 and M2/M3=1.35. Hence, M1 =1.15*M2, and M2=1.35*M3. Therefore, M1 =1.15*1.35*M3=1.5525*M3.

But how do those masses affect the problem?

But equilibrium temperature depends only on the distance and star's luminosity and albedo, not the planet's mass. So perhaps the problem is not expecting you to use the mass ratios. So maybe that data is redundant, but is it a trick question where you actually do need to use the masses?

Wait, but let me check. If mass affects the orbital period. Wait, if you have two planets with different masses, in the same orbit, they might have different orbital periods? Wait, no. Kepler's third law states that the period is independent of the planet's mass. So even with different masses, if they're orbiting the same star, and at the same distance, their orbital periods are the same, which is because in the formula P² ∝ D³/(M + m), but M is the star's mass, so P depends just on D and M (the star's mass). So m is negligible.

Thus, mass ratios should not affect orbital periods, and so the temperature ratios are sufficient to calculate the distance ratios, hence the period ratios. Therefore, the info on mass ratios might be extraneous, just to confirm that they were indeed discovered via TTV (which does require masses to create detectable signals). But maybe the problem includes it to see if you know that masses aren't needed for the calculation of the orbital period, assuming they orbit the same star.

Thus, perhaps proceeding as before is correct.

In which case, answer is approx 33.39. But let me ensure my previous calculation is correct.

T1/T2 =1.4 so (D2/D1)^(1/2) =1.4 => D2=1.96 D1.

T2/T3=2.3 => (D3/D2)^(1/2)=2.3 => D3=5.29 D2.

Hence D3=5.29*1.96 D1 ≈10.3684 D1.

Kepler's law: P ∝ D^(3/2). Therefore, P3/P1=(10.3684)^(3/2)≈(3.22)^3≈33.39.

That's the answer. Since the answer is supposed to be in boxed notation, maybe 33.4 or 33, but maybe the calculation can be made more precise. However, the problem gives ratios that are approximate (1.4, 2.3, 1.15, 1.35). That suggests that we may have to use exact calculations with these numbers, but when squared, they give exact numbers. Wait, 1.4 squared is 1.96, which is exact. 2.3 squared is 5.29, which is exact. 1.15 and 1.35 when multiplied together give 1.5525, but as these are given as 1.15 and 1.35, even multiplied are precise.

Alternatively, maybe we are to use the exact ratios given?

Wait, if we track everything symbolically:

Given T1/T2 =1.4 and T2/T3=2.3.

From the equilibrium temperature formula:

T^4 ∝ 1/D² => (T1/T2)^4 = (D2/D1)^2 => (1.4)^4 = (D2/D1)^2 => D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 =1.96. Correct.

Similarly, (T2/T3)^4 = (D3/D2)^2 => (2.3)^4 = (D3/D2)^2 => D3/D2=(2.3)^2 =5.29.

Therefore, D3=5.29 D2=5.29 *1.96 D1=10.3684 D1.

So period P3/P1=(D3/D1)^(3/2)=(10.3684)^(3/2). As previously, which gives approximately 33.39.

Why 33.39? Wait, as 10.3684 is approximately 10.37, so, however, exact cube is 10.37*(10.37)^0.5. Wait, but sqrt(10.37) is exactly 3.22 (since 3.22 squared is 10.37). So cube is 3.22 *3.22*3.22=33.39. However, if you want to get precise value, 3.22*3.22=10.3684; then, 10.3684 *3.22:

10 * 3.22 =32.2

0.3684*3.22= 1.186248

Total 33.386248, which is approx 33.386. So 33.39 or 33.4 when rounded. But maybe the actual exact fractions would be cleaner.

Wait, considering that 1.4 is likely 14/10=7/5. 1.4 is 7/5.

Similarly, 2.3 might be 23/10.

Then let me recast the D ratios in fractions.

If T1/T2=7/5, so:.

(D2/D1)^(1/2)=7/5 => D2/D1 = (7/5)^2 =49/25=1.96, same as before.

T2/T3=23/10, so (D3/D2)^(1/2)=23/10, => D3/D2=(23/10)^2=529/100=5.29.

Therefore, D3=529/100 * D2=529/100 *49/25 D1=(529*49)/(100*25) D1.

Multiply numerators:529*49. Let me compute that.

529 ×49: 529×50=26450, minus 529=26450-529=25921.

Denominator:100×25=2500.

Therefore, D3/D1=25921/2500.

Therefore, (D3/D1)^(3/2)= (25921/2500)^(3/2)= sqrt(25921/2500)^3 =(sqrt(25921)/sqrt(2500)))^3=(161/50)^3.

Because sqrt(25921)=161 (since 160²=25600, 161²=25921), and sqrt(2500)=50. Thus (161/50)^3.

Calculating this:

First, 161^3: 161*161=25921, then 25921*161.

Not so fun to compute, but we can note that:

161 * 161 = (160 +1)^2 =25600 + 320 +1=25921

25921*161=25921*(160+1)=25921*160 +25921*1=4147360 +25921=4173281.

Similarly, 50^3=125000. Therefore, (161/50)^3=4173281/125000=33.386248.

Thus, the same value as before: approximately 33.386. So boxed as \boxed{33.4}?

Alternatively, since the problem gives ratios as approximate (1.4, 2.3), we need to consider that they might not be exact. So maybe 1.4 is an approximate ratio implying that the answer is roughly 33. But more accurately 33.4, but since in the question it's mentioned "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures ... is approximately 1.4, and ... about 2.3", so the periods would be approximate as well. However, if I need to use significant figures, possibly two sig figs. 1.4 and 2.3 are two sig figs each. So 1.4 (two) leading to 1.96 (still two, as 1.4 is two), 2.3 (two) leading to 5.29 (technically three, but since original is two... but depending on how you compute). The final D3/D1 is 1.96 *5.29≈10.368, two decimal digits but original ratios have two sig figs. Therefore, D3/D1≈10 (with 1 sig fig) may be overdramatic, but 10.37 could be approximated as 10, but perhaps using the least number of sig figs, which were two. Therefore, the final calculation is (10.37)^1.5 ~33.4, which would be two sig figs:33, but since 33.386 is three sig figs.

Alternatively, if 1.4 is two sig figs, and 2.3 is two sig figs, when multiplied through, the result would have two sig figs, so 33 (two sig figs)? But given that in intermediate steps, when multiplying (D3/D1) =1.96 *5.29= approximately 10.368. Since 1.96 has three sig figs (1.96 has three), and 5.29 has three (from 2.3 squared). Therefore, maybe 10.37 has three sig figs.

Wait, but how were they calculated? If the problem gives 1.4 as ratio (which is two sig figs), so (1.4)^2 =1.96 (so they wrote approximately 1.4, but actually provided with two sig figs). But if the ratio is given as approximate 1.4, so maybe the accuracy is not a strict 1.4, but if considered 1.40, meaning they might even have three sig figs? Hmmm.

Alternatively, given the question is presented in approximate terms, the answer is 33 or 33.4. Hmm.

Wait, given that in the problem statement all the initial ratios are given in approximate decimals (e.g., 1.4, 2.3, 1.15, 1.35) which is up to three significant figures (e.g., 1.15, 1.35 = three; 1.4,2.3=two). However, when squaring 1.4 (1.4^2=1.96) which is more accurately two sig figs, though 1.96 is three. It's maybe confusing.

Alternatively, I wonder if the answer requires using the given values exactly as written without approximating in between, to multiply the temperature ratios as per the formula to get the distance ratio.

So, T1/T2 = 1.4 , so (D2/D1) = (T1/T2)^2 =1.4^2=1.96.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3, so (D3/D2)=(T2/T3)^2=2.3^2=5.29.

Thus, D3/D1= 1.96*5.29=10.3684.

Then (D3/D1)^(3/2)= (10.3684)^1.5 = approx 33.386.

Since the question says "by what factor", a multiplier, so approximately this value, maybe rounded to two decimal places, but in the box you can put an exact decimal or a fractional number. Alternatively, writing in terms of the exponents. Wait, if we express the initial exact expressions.

But perhaps 33.4 is a good approximate. But checking my steps again. Hmm.

Alternatively, let me check whether the initial parent star of the planets is the same for all three. The only possible parameter that would matter for temperature is distance and star's luminosity.

If we are assuming all three planets are orbiting the same star, then my assumption holds. The problem statement starts by: "Astronomers are studying a system of three exoplanets...", system implies a single star. Therefore, yes, same star. Therefore, L is the same.

Therefore, all steps leading to P3/P1≈33.4 seem correct. Hence, must need to check why even give mass ratios. The mass ratios are given: "ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35".

Could they be misdirection? Or is there an actual connection between masses and the semi-major axis?

Hmm. Well, the mass ratios may be necessary if the system is a hierarchical triple. For example, if Planet2 is orbiting Planet1 and Planet3 is orbiting Planet2. But the problem states that they're all discovered through the TTV method, which typically refers to planets around the same star. So more likely, they are all orbiting the same star, and masses are given to see if they can trick you into using them in some way.

But it's possible that if two-body Kepler's law includes the mass. Let's consider a two-body problem where period is:

P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) a³, where M is star's mass and m is planet's mass.

If two different planets have different m's, but M dominates, and M ≫ m1, m2, m3, then P is determined mostly by a.

But we don’t know the mass of the star here. So even if so, how would we compute the ratio?

Left to right.

For Planet1: P1² ∝ a1³/(M + m1)

For Planet3: P3² ∝ a3³/(M + m3)

Therefore, the period ratio would be (P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3 * (M + m1)/(M + m3)

Therefore P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) * sqrt( (M + m1)/(M + m3) )

But if M ≫ m1, m3, then (M + m1)/(M + m3) ≈ (M(1 + m1/M )) / (M(1 + m3/M )) ≈ (1 + m1/M - m3/M )

But to even first order, unless you have parameters, you cannot compute this, especially since M is not given.

But since the mass ratios between the planets are given. m1/m2 = 1.15, m2/m3=1.35 => m1/m3=1.15*1.35=1.5525

But since m1, m2, and m3 in terms of Jupiter masses or Earth masses: But absent additional info, this can't be used given that star's mass is unknown. So even considering that, we can’t calculate the period ratio from masses.

Therefore, perhaps those are supposed to be ignored.

Given that, then answer is 33.4.

Therefore, \boxed{33.4}

But let me check again if there is a reason to think that perhaps the density or some other parameter related to equilibrium temperature affects mass.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps if someone was to mix the temperatures with masses thinking through some kind of density calculation or something else. For instance, density relates mass and radius, but if the planet's radius affects equilibrium temperature. Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is (1 - a) L / (16πσ D² )^(1/4). Radius is not in the formula. Because it's the temperature at the planet's surface? No, here equilibrium temperature refers to the effective temperature, which is a function of incoming flux and albedo, as (L*(1 - a)/(16 pi sigma D^2 ))^(1/4). So planet radius does not come into play there, so T ∝ (L/D²)^(1/4). Therefore, no, without the planet's radius or other factors, you can't get radius from mass given.

Therefore, since radius is needed to get density from mass, or to find gravity. But unless there's a detail missed, albedo is given, and equal for all.

Alternatively, maybe if there's a difference in greenhouse gas effect, but they probably mention equilibrium temperature which accounts only for stellar flux and albedo, so the problem says "equilibrium temperature".

Therefore, thinking through all these, mass ratios should not affect the answer. Hence, probably answer is 33.4. Therefore, conclusion.

**Final Answer**
The orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of \boxed{33.4}.

But maybe we need to keep more accurate decimals or consider if there\'s a mistake.\n\nWait a moment. Solar systems\' exoplanet parameters might depend inversely. Wait in equilibrium temperature formula: T_eq ∝ (L / D²)^(1/4). Alternatively, maybe I need to confirm the formula.\n\nThe equilibrium temperature formula is indeed T = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16πσ D²) ]^(1/4), correct. Since L is the same for all planets (they orbit same star), then T ∝ D^(-1/2). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures would be inverse square roots of the distances ratios. Since T1/T2 = 1.4, so T1 > T2, indicating D1 < D2. So D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3, so T2 > T3 => D2 < D3, so D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. Then D3 = 1.96 * 5.29 D1? Wait, perhaps I made a step error here.\n\nWait D3 would be D2 * 5.29, and D2 is D1 * 1.96. So D3 = D1 * 1.96 * 5.29 = 1.96 * 5.29 = approximately 10.3684 D1. Then for Kepler\'s law, period is according to (D)^(3/2). So Period ratio is (10.3684)^(3/2).\n\nNow, to compute (10.3684)^(3/2):\n\nFirst, take the square root of 10.3684: sqrt(10.3684) ≈ 3.22 (since 3.22^2 = 10.3684)\n\nThen cube it: (3.22)^3 = 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22 = 10.3684 * 3.22. As before, giving ≈33.38.\n\nWait, indeed correct. So the factor is approximately 33.4. But let me check.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the question is more complex. The problem mentions masses given between the planets: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. But how does mass affect the period?\n\nHmm, but Kepler\'s third law, in its basic form (for exoplanets, using the version derived from Newtonian gravity holding when the planet\'s mass is negligible compared to the star). So the period depends only on the semi-major axis and the star\'s mass. If the planet\'s mass is not negligible, the formula becomes more complex. However, typical TTV (Transit Timing Variations) occur because the planets perturb each other\'s orbits slightly, but the problem statement doesn\'t indicate that we need to account for the masses in the orbital periods.\n\nThe question says "if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3", so the temperatures ratio allows us to find the distances. But the problem gives mass ratios. So why are the masses mentioned?\n\nBut, since TTV is a method for detecting exoplanets where the gravitational pull of other planets causes variations in transit times. So the masses would be related to the gravitational influences. Hmmm.\n\nBut the question asks for the orbital period ratio of Planet3 to Planet1. Since periods are determined by their distances via Kepler\'s third law, regardless of their masses. Unless the problem expects us to compute something else, maybe using tides or something else that depends on mass, but the equilibrium temperature is dictated by distance and albedo. So maybe the mass doesn\'t directly affect the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the mentioned masses might be a red herring, but perhaps not.\n\nWait, but if you have some relation between mass and the position. Are they perhaps using a particular scaling? No, I don\'t recall equilibrium temperature being dependent on a planet\'s mass. The albedo is given, so that\'s the same. Maybe if the star\'s luminosity isn\'t given, but we are using ratios so luminosity cancels out.\n\nTherefore, perhaps given that masses ratios are not used here. But then why mention the mass ratios?\n\nThis is puzzling. Wait the problem says astronomers found the ratios of equilibrium temperatures and masses. Then the question is asking about orbital period ratio.\n\nPossibly, the given mass ratios are provided because the actual problem requires using some relation that involves mass. But in standard orbital mechanics, periods are independent of the planets\' masses (assuming M_planet << M_star). However, if the TTV method is being used, the masses could be influencing the orbital periods through their mutual gravitational interactions. But TTV uses the variations in the transit times caused by the gravitational tugs of other planets, which depend on the masses. But calculating the period ratios based on TTV might require knowing the masses, but I’m not sure.\n\nBut if the periods here are Keplerian (Kepler\'s third law) irrespective of the planet\'s masses, I would then think the masses don\'t factor into the calculation. But the problem gives mass ratios. Therefore, perhaps this is a trick question where we (the student) might overcomplicate it by thinking about masses affecting temperature or period. But equilibrium temperature doesn\'t depend on planetary mass, only distance, albedo, and star\'s luminosity.\n\nThe only thought is that if the problem is considering that more massive planets might have more internal heat, affecting their equilibrium temperature. But equilibrium temperature is about absorbed starlight vs. radiated heat. It\'s based on stellar flux, not the planet\'s internal heat, so masses shouldn\'t affect it.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using surface gravity or something that mass and radius would affect. But if T = [L*(1-a)/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4 ). Here, L is the stellar luminosity. The problem, since all planets have same albedo, equilibrium temperatures ratios depend only on L and D. But star\'s luminosity is same for all, so T ~ D^{-1/2}. So unless the planet\'s mass affects the star\'s luminosity, which it doesn\'t. Therefore, T ratios translate into distance ratios, which then can be used via Kepler\'s third law.\n\nBut given that periods depend only on the distance (semi-major axis), we don’t need the mass ratios. Therefore, maybe the problem is designed to test if the student gets confused and start involving the mass ratios unnecessarily.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the final answer is deriving D3/D1 from the temperatures ratios, then applying Kepler\'s third law. So. Get D3/D1 = 1.96 * 5.29 = 10.3684. Then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) ≈ (10.3684)^1.5 ≈ 33.38. But precise value might be required. So we need to compute 10.3684^(3/2). Since 10.3684^(1/2) ≈ 3.22, then cubed is as before ~33.38.\n\nBut let me compute (10.3684)^(3/2) exactly.\n\nSquare root of 10.3684. Let\'s do exact calculation. 3.22*3.22 = 10.3684. So sqrt(10.3684) = 3.22. So 3.22^3 = 3.22*3.22*3.22 = (3.22*3.22)=10.3684*3.22. So 10.3684 * 3.22.\n\nComputing 10.3684 * 3.22:\n\n10 * 3.22 = 32.2\n\n0.3684 * 3.22:\n\n0.3 * 3.22 = 0.966\n\n0.06 * 3.22 = 0.1932\n\n0.0084 * 3.22 = 0.027048\n\nSum: 0.966 + 0.1932 = 1.1592 + 0.027048 = 1.186248\n\nTherefore, 32.2 + 1.186248 ≈ 33.386248. So ≈33.386.\n\nBut is that the correct application? Considering if we use more precise intermediate steps, but regardless of that key point.\n\nBut now, let\'s think again: D3/D1 is 1.4² times 2.3²? Wait.\n\nHold on: The problem gives Temperature ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 as 1.4 (T1/T2=1.4), so according to the formula, that\'s D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2 = 1.96. Then Planet2 to Planet3, T2/T3=2.3, so similar D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = 5.29, so expanding D3/D1 = 1.96*5.29≈10.3684. Thus, Period ratio is (10.3684)^(3/2)=33.386. That seems right.\n\nBut the existence of the mass ratios (1.15 and 1.35 for Planet1/Planet2 and Planet2/Planet3) hasn\'t been used. Should there be an error in question, or expectations?\n\nAlternatively, is requiring to use the mass ratio, if possible.\n\nPossibly rather than using D from equilibrium temperature, perhaps the orbital period can be related to the mass through another method, but I don\'t recall any direct relationship between a planet\'s mass and its orbital period. Assuming that the orbits are determined by the star\'s gravity alone. Unless in planetary systems where planet masses are a non-negligible fraction of the star\'s mass, but given that exoplanets typically are much less in mass compared to their stars, the approximation that their mass is negligible in Kepler\'s third law is valid.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the mass ratios are not necessary here. Therefore, their inclusion is meant to test to see if students can filter out unnecessary information. Oh yes!\n\nThus, the answer here is about 33.4. Probably significant figures: since the given ratios are to two decimal places (1.4, 2.3, 1.15, 1.35). But the given ratios of temperature are approximate: "approximately 1.4" and "about 2.3". Same for the mass ratios. To be safe, if the inferred D3/D1 is approximately 10.37, so P3/P1 approx 33.4. This is a high factor, but because the temperature ratios are relatively high. Actually, considering that temperature ratio of Planet2/Planet3 is 2.3, so Planet3 is much farther. Then as per orbital period scaling with D^{3/2}, the large distance would significantly increase the period.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if the original system\'s temperature ratios lead to larger period ratios.\n\nWait, with T1/T2 = 1.4: since temperatures relate inversely to distances. So T ~ D^{-1/2}; double the distance would be sqrt(L)/2, or in this case, D2 = (T1 / T2)^2 * D1. So yes.\n\nPerhaps the given answer is indeed 33.3, 33.4, or something similar, but depending on how precise you want to be.\n\nBut why would the masses be mentioned then? Hmm. Unless there\'s a relation between orbital period and mass through TTV\'s methodology. Maybe in that the TTV method measures the planet\'s mass via gravitational interactions, which cause variations in transit timings. But determining the periods doesn\'t directly use the masses—periods are measured through transits, and the TTV gives info on the masses. So the fact that they found the masses (so through TTV), but we need the period ratio. Hence, orbital periods would. So perhaps the problem is independently deriving the orbital period ratios using both temperature and mass info. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, using mass and temperature to find both distances and possibly some dynamics. But how? Not that I.orbit\n\nAlternatively, if the system is in resonance, the periods ratios could be related to their masses. But that complicates, and the problem hasn’t mentioned any resonance.\n\nAlternatively, using Newtonian form of Kepler\'s third law which includes the mass, but if Mplanet is significant:\n\n(P/(2π))^2 = a³/(G(Mstar + Mplanet))\n\nBut since the planet masses are much less than the star\'s mass, even if the star\'s mass is unknown, the ratios of periods would depend mainly on the distances, star\'s mass being same in all cases. So let\'s see:\n\nNewtonian form: P² = (4π²/G(Mstar + Mplanet)) * a³\n\nIf Mplanet is << Mstar, as usual, then P² ≈ (4π²/(G Mstar)) * a³, so periods are still independent of planet mass. Therefore, for each planet, as Mplanet << Mstar, their masses would have negligible effect on their own orbital periods.\n\nSo, perhaps the given masses are red herrings, irrelevant for the calculation. Therefore, the orbital period ratio can be determined from temperatures (which give distance ratio), applying Kepler\'s law.\n\nThus answer is approximately 33.4, rounded to two or three significant figures? The problem\'s given ratios (1.4, 2.3,1.15,1.35) have two significant figures. However, since most ratios given are two, except perhaps 1.4 is two, 2.3 is two, 1.15 and 1.35 are three.\n\nBut to stay on safest terms, perhaps compute the answer using more precise ratios.\n\nAlternatively, using the exactly given ratios:\n\nPer the problem statement:\n\nT1/T2 = 1.4, so exactly this ratio. So D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96\n\nT2/T3 = 2.3, so D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29\n\nTherefore, D3/D1 = 1.96 * 5.29 = 1.96 * 5.29. Let\'s compute this precisely:\n\nSince 1.96 * 5 = 9.8\n\n1.96 * 0.29 = 0.5684\n\nHence, 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684\n\nSo D3/D1 = 10.3684\n\nThen P3/P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^1.5.\n\nAs sqrt(10.3684) is 3.22, hence the cube etc. So indeed 3.22^3 = approx. 33.384. Hence, 33.4.\n\nConsidering significant figures:\n\nThe problem specifies the temperature ratios as approximate: "approximately 1.4" and " about 2.3 ", and same for masses words. Therefore, the answer needs a reasonable number of significant figures. As 1.4 and 2.3 each have two sig-figs. Therefore, following through the calculations:\n\n(1.4)^2 is 1.96 (which, when rounded from approx 1.4 is two sf, retaining two sf would be 2.0 for (1.4)^2). Wait, perhaps the initial ratios are given as approx, so:\n\nBut when we compute, we can keep intermediate values precise to avoid error, then round the final answer. However, standard rules are:\n\n- Number of sig figs in multiplication: the result has the same number of sig figs as the least precise value.\n\nBut for exam problems like this, unless specified, often they expect an exact fraction or a specific decimal.\n\nAlternatively, given the problem is approximately by accounting for rounding, perhaps the answer to around two significant figures, although 33.4 is about two, but 33 has two figs, 33.4 three. Let\'s see.\n\nAlternatively, exact fractions:\n\nGiven T1/T2 = 1.4 = 14/10 = 7/5. Then D2/D1 = (7/5)^2 = 49/25.\n\nT2/T3 = 2.3 = 23/10. So D3/D2=(23/10)^2 = 529/100. Therefore, D3/D1 = (49/25)*(529/100) = (49*529)/(25*100). Calculate numerator: 49*529.\n\n49 *500 =24,500; 49*29=1,421 => total 24,500 +1,421=25,921. Denominator: 25*100=2,500. Hence D3/D1=25921/2500=10.3684. Then, P3/P1 = (25921/2500)^(3/2). This can be written as (25921/2500)^(1/2) * (25921/2500).\n\nFirst compute sqrt(25921/2500). sqrt(25921)=161, since 160²=25,600. 161²=25,921. So sqrt(25921/2500) =161/50=3.22.\n\nThen multiply numerator and denominator: (161/50)*(25921/2500)=161*25921/(50*2500). But exponent is 3/2 so square root multiplied by original fraction. Alternatively, already have this step.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n(P3/P1) = (D3/D1)^(3/2)= (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ 33.384. But the exact fractions:\n\n161/50 * 25921/2500: since sqrt(D3/D1) = 161/50, then then cubed (since 3/2 exponent) is multiplied by D3/D1 again to the 1/2:\n\nWait no, sorry. (D^3/2) = D^(1 +1/2)= D * sqrt(D). So for D3/D1=25921/2500,  multiplicative factor is (25921/2500) * (161/50) = as above. So 25921/2500 *161/50. 25921 *161=for detailed exactness:\n\n25921 * 160 =4,147,360\n\n25921 *1=25,921\n\nTotal 4,147,360 +25,921=4,173,281. Then denominator: 2500*50=125,000. So 4,173,281 /125,000 = about 33.386248.\n\nSo exactly, it\'d be 4,173,281/125,000=33.386248. So as a decimal, approximately 33.386.\n\nIf the problem expects an exact answer, it\'s likely rational but not integral. Yet likely, the answer is approximated to about 33.4.\n\nAlternatively, given the mass ratios, but I\'ve concluded they\'re unnecessary, So the answer is approx.33.4.\n\nBut since the given data in the problem is:\n\n-Temperature ratios: ~1.4 and ~2.3 (two significant figures each?)\n\n-Mass ratios: ~1.15 and ~1.35 (three significant figures each?)\n\nBut the answer would need to respect of what sig figs data provides. So the weakest link here. The Temperature ratios given as approximate, 1.4 (two), 2.3(two). So maybe only two significant figures.\n\nIf so, D2/D1 is approx.1.4²=1.96 which to two sigs is≈ 2.0. D3/D2=2.3²=5.29, to two sigs≈5.3. So D3/D1=2.0 * 5.3≈10.6.\n\nThen Period ratio P= (10.6)^(3/2).\n\nFirst sqrt10.6 ≈ 3.26, the cube is 3.26^3≈3.26*10.6 approx (since 3.26*3.26=10.6), and then * 3.26: 10.6*3.26≈34.6. But this is very approximate. Alternatively, use sqrt(10.6)=3.256, cube that is3.256^3=3.256*3.256=10.595, 10.595*3.256=34.447… Approximately 34.4.\n\n\nIf the temp ratios are known to two sig figs, per problem statement, but the answer would be sensitive.\n\nBut when mitzvah’s specs of the operation from precise data leads to approx.33.38. Hence, might the answer be written as approximately 33.4. Answer box is requiring maybe a 2 sig-fig, being ≈33 or 33 or explicit decimals.\n\nBut the problem specifies "by what factor". Given that it\'s numerical and TTV is precise enough, but addresses data given as approximate ratios. So likely acceptable answer is 33.4.\n\nBut think the mistake is how we square or cube. Check again.\n\nT1/T2=1.4, meaning that D2/D1=(T1 / T2)^2=1.4²=1.96 as given. We don\'t bring Planet2 related parameters into Planet3 at prior step. Later, using the temperature ratio defines D3= D2*(T2 / T3)^2, yeah.\n\nThe logic is correct. Thus, answer is 33.4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \\boxed{33.4} times larger than that of Planet1.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743811715, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5206, prompt_tokens=794, total_tokens=6000, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by \( T = \left( \frac{L (1 - a)}{16 \pi \sigma D^2} \right)^{1/4} \), where \( T \) is the temperature, \( L \) is the star's luminosity, \( a \) is the albedo, \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and \( D \) is the distance from the star. For the same star and albedo, the temperature ratio between two planets is inversely proportional to the square root of their distance ratio. 

Given:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \)
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \)

Using the temperature ratio to find the distance ratio:
- \( \frac{D_2}{D_1} = \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \)
- \( \frac{D_3}{D_2} = \left( \frac{T_2}{T_3} \right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \)

Combining these distance ratios:
- \( \frac{D_3}{D_1} = \frac{D_2}{D_1} \times \frac{D_3}{D_2} = 1.96 \times 5.29 = 10.3684 \)

Using Kepler's third law (\( P^2 \propto D^3 \)) to find the orbital period ratio:
- \( \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \right)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{3/2} \)

Calculating \( (10.3684)^{3/2} \):
- \( \sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \)
- \( (3.22)^3 \approx 33.386 \)

Rounding to a reasonable number of significant figures, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

\boxed{33.4}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 But wait, 3.22 cubed is 3.22*3.22*3.22. Let me check again:

3.22 * 3.22 = 10.3684 (as before)
Now multiply by 3.22:
10.3684 * 3.22

Breaking it down:
10 * 3.22 = 32.2
0.3684 * 3.22 ≈ 1.184
Total ≈ 32.2 + 1.184 = 33.384, so approximately 33.38.

Therefore, the factor is about 33.4. But maybe we need to keep more accurate decimals or consider if there's a mistake.

Wait a moment. Solar systems' exoplanet parameters might depend inversely. Wait in equilibrium temperature formula: T_eq ∝ (L / D²)^(1/4). Alternatively, maybe I need to confirm the formula.

The equilibrium temperature formula is indeed T = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16πσ D²) ]^(1/4), correct. Since L is the same for all planets (they orbit same star), then T ∝ D^(-1/2). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures would be inverse square roots of the distances ratios. Since T1/T2 = 1.4, so T1 > T2, indicating D1 < D2. So D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3, so T2 > T3 => D2 < D3, so D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. Then D3 = 1.96 * 5.29 D1? Wait, perhaps I made a step error here.

Wait D3 would be D2 * 5.29, and D2 is D1 * 1.96. So D3 = D1 * 1.96 * 5.29 = 1.96 * 5.29 = approximately 10.3684 D1. Then for Kepler's law, period is according to (D)^(3/2). So Period ratio is (10.3684)^(3/2).

Now, to compute (10.3684)^(3/2):

First, take the square root of 10.3684: sqrt(10.3684) ≈ 3.22 (since 3.22^2 = 10.3684)

Then cube it: (3.22)^3 = 3.22 * 3.22 * 3.22 = 10.3684 * 3.22. As before, giving ≈33.38.

Wait, indeed correct. So the factor is approximately 33.4. But let me check.

But wait, perhaps the question is more complex. The problem mentions masses given between the planets: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. But how does mass affect the period?

Hmm, but Kepler's third law, in its basic form (for exoplanets, using the version derived from Newtonian gravity holding when the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star). So the period depends only on the semi-major axis and the star's mass. If the planet's mass is not negligible, the formula becomes more complex. However, typical TTV (Transit Timing Variations) occur because the planets perturb each other's orbits slightly, but the problem statement doesn't indicate that we need to account for the masses in the orbital periods.

The question says "if the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3", so the temperatures ratio allows us to find the distances. But the problem gives mass ratios. So why are the masses mentioned?

But, since TTV is a method for detecting exoplanets where the gravitational pull of other planets causes variations in transit times. So the masses would be related to the gravitational influences. Hmmm.

But the question asks for the orbital period ratio of Planet3 to Planet1. Since periods are determined by their distances via Kepler's third law, regardless of their masses. Unless the problem expects us to compute something else, maybe using tides or something else that depends on mass, but the equilibrium temperature is dictated by distance and albedo. So maybe the mass doesn't directly affect the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the mentioned masses might be a red herring, but perhaps not.

Wait, but if you have some relation between mass and the position. Are they perhaps using a particular scaling? No, I don't recall equilibrium temperature being dependent on a planet's mass. The albedo is given, so that's the same. Maybe if the star's luminosity isn't given, but we are using ratios so luminosity cancels out.

Therefore, perhaps given that masses ratios are not used here. But then why mention the mass ratios?

This is puzzling. Wait the problem says astronomers found the ratios of equilibrium temperatures and masses. Then the question is asking about orbital period ratio.

Possibly, the given mass ratios are provided because the actual problem requires using some relation that involves mass. But in standard orbital mechanics, periods are independent of the planets' masses (assuming M_planet << M_star). However, if the TTV method is being used, the masses could be influencing the orbital periods through their mutual gravitational interactions. But TTV uses the variations in the transit times caused by the gravitational tugs of other planets, which depend on the masses. But calculating the period ratios based on TTV might require knowing the masses, but I’m not sure.

But if the periods here are Keplerian (Kepler's third law) irrespective of the planet's masses, I would then think the masses don't factor into the calculation. But the problem gives mass ratios. Therefore, perhaps this is a trick question where we (the student) might overcomplicate it by thinking about masses affecting temperature or period. But equilibrium temperature doesn't depend on planetary mass, only distance, albedo, and star's luminosity.

The only thought is that if the problem is considering that more massive planets might have more internal heat, affecting their equilibrium temperature. But equilibrium temperature is about absorbed starlight vs. radiated heat. It's based on stellar flux, not the planet's internal heat, so masses shouldn't affect it.

Alternatively, the problem might be using surface gravity or something that mass and radius would affect. But if T = [L*(1-a)/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4 ). Here, L is the stellar luminosity. The problem, since all planets have same albedo, equilibrium temperatures ratios depend only on L and D. But star's luminosity is same for all, so T ~ D^{-1/2}. So unless the planet's mass affects the star's luminosity, which it doesn't. Therefore, T ratios translate into distance ratios, which then can be used via Kepler's third law.

But given that periods depend only on the distance (semi-major axis), we don’t need the mass ratios. Therefore, maybe the problem is designed to test if the student gets confused and start involving the mass ratios unnecessarily.

Therefore, perhaps the final answer is deriving D3/D1 from the temperatures ratios, then applying Kepler's third law. So. Get D3/D1 = 1.96 * 5.29 = 10.3684. Then P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) ≈ (10.3684)^1.5 ≈ 33.38. But precise value might be required. So we need to compute 10.3684^(3/2). Since 10.3684^(1/2) ≈ 3.22, then cubed is as before ~33.38.

But let me compute (10.3684)^(3/2) exactly.

Square root of 10.3684. Let's do exact calculation. 3.22*3.22 = 10.3684. So sqrt(10.3684) = 3.22. So 3.22^3 = 3.22*3.22*3.22 = (3.22*3.22)=10.3684*3.22. So 10.3684 * 3.22.

Computing 10.3684 * 3.22:

10 * 3.22 = 32.2

0.3684 * 3.22:

0.3 * 3.22 = 0.966

0.06 * 3.22 = 0.1932

0.0084 * 3.22 = 0.027048

Sum: 0.966 + 0.1932 = 1.1592 + 0.027048 = 1.186248

Therefore, 32.2 + 1.186248 ≈ 33.386248. So ≈33.386.

But is that the correct application? Considering if we use more precise intermediate steps, but regardless of that key point.

But now, let's think again: D3/D1 is 1.4² times 2.3²? Wait.

Hold on: The problem gives Temperature ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 as 1.4 (T1/T2=1.4), so according to the formula, that's D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2 = 1.96. Then Planet2 to Planet3, T2/T3=2.3, so similar D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = 5.29, so expanding D3/D1 = 1.96*5.29≈10.3684. Thus, Period ratio is (10.3684)^(3/2)=33.386. That seems right.

But the existence of the mass ratios (1.15 and 1.35 for Planet1/Planet2 and Planet2/Planet3) hasn't been used. Should there be an error in question, or expectations?

Alternatively, is requiring to use the mass ratio, if possible.

Possibly rather than using D from equilibrium temperature, perhaps the orbital period can be related to the mass through another method, but I don't recall any direct relationship between a planet's mass and its orbital period. Assuming that the orbits are determined by the star's gravity alone. Unless in planetary systems where planet masses are a non-negligible fraction of the star's mass, but given that exoplanets typically are much less in mass compared to their stars, the approximation that their mass is negligible in Kepler's third law is valid.

Therefore, perhaps the mass ratios are not necessary here. Therefore, their inclusion is meant to test to see if students can filter out unnecessary information. Oh yes!

Thus, the answer here is about 33.4. Probably significant figures: since the given ratios are to two decimal places (1.4, 2.3, 1.15, 1.35). But the given ratios of temperature are approximate: "approximately 1.4" and "about 2.3". Same for the mass ratios. To be safe, if the inferred D3/D1 is approximately 10.37, so P3/P1 approx 33.4. This is a high factor, but because the temperature ratios are relatively high. Actually, considering that temperature ratio of Planet2/Planet3 is 2.3, so Planet3 is much farther. Then as per orbital period scaling with D^{3/2}, the large distance would significantly increase the period.

Alternatively, let me check if the original system's temperature ratios lead to larger period ratios.

Wait, with T1/T2 = 1.4: since temperatures relate inversely to distances. So T ~ D^{-1/2}; double the distance would be sqrt(L)/2, or in this case, D2 = (T1 / T2)^2 * D1. So yes.

Perhaps the given answer is indeed 33.3, 33.4, or something similar, but depending on how precise you want to be.

But why would the masses be mentioned then? Hmm. Unless there's a relation between orbital period and mass through TTV's methodology. Maybe in that the TTV method measures the planet's mass via gravitational interactions, which cause variations in transit timings. But determining the periods doesn't directly use the masses—periods are measured through transits, and the TTV gives info on the masses. So the fact that they found the masses (so through TTV), but we need the period ratio. Hence, orbital periods would. So perhaps the problem is independently deriving the orbital period ratios using both temperature and mass info. Hmm.

Alternatively, using mass and temperature to find both distances and possibly some dynamics. But how? Not that I.orbit

Alternatively, if the system is in resonance, the periods ratios could be related to their masses. But that complicates, and the problem hasn’t mentioned any resonance.

Alternatively, using Newtonian form of Kepler's third law which includes the mass, but if Mplanet is significant:

(P/(2π))^2 = a³/(G(Mstar + Mplanet))

But since the planet masses are much less than the star's mass, even if the star's mass is unknown, the ratios of periods would depend mainly on the distances, star's mass being same in all cases. So let's see:

Newtonian form: P² = (4π²/G(Mstar + Mplanet)) * a³

If Mplanet is << Mstar, as usual, then P² ≈ (4π²/(G Mstar)) * a³, so periods are still independent of planet mass. Therefore, for each planet, as Mplanet << Mstar, their masses would have negligible effect on their own orbital periods.

So, perhaps the given masses are red herrings, irrelevant for the calculation. Therefore, the orbital period ratio can be determined from temperatures (which give distance ratio), applying Kepler's law.

Thus answer is approximately 33.4, rounded to two or three significant figures? The problem's given ratios (1.4, 2.3,1.15,1.35) have two significant figures. However, since most ratios given are two, except perhaps 1.4 is two, 2.3 is two, 1.15 and 1.35 are three.

But to stay on safest terms, perhaps compute the answer using more precise ratios.

Alternatively, using the exactly given ratios:

Per the problem statement:

T1/T2 = 1.4, so exactly this ratio. So D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96

T2/T3 = 2.3, so D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29

Therefore, D3/D1 = 1.96 * 5.29 = 1.96 * 5.29. Let's compute this precisely:

Since 1.96 * 5 = 9.8

1.96 * 0.29 = 0.5684

Hence, 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684

So D3/D1 = 10.3684

Then P3/P1 = (10.3684)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^1.5.

As sqrt(10.3684) is 3.22, hence the cube etc. So indeed 3.22^3 = approx. 33.384. Hence, 33.4.

Considering significant figures:

The problem specifies the temperature ratios as approximate: "approximately 1.4" and " about 2.3 ", and same for masses words. Therefore, the answer needs a reasonable number of significant figures. As 1.4 and 2.3 each have two sig-figs. Therefore, following through the calculations:

(1.4)^2 is 1.96 (which, when rounded from approx 1.4 is two sf, retaining two sf would be 2.0 for (1.4)^2). Wait, perhaps the initial ratios are given as approx, so:

But when we compute, we can keep intermediate values precise to avoid error, then round the final answer. However, standard rules are:

- Number of sig figs in multiplication: the result has the same number of sig figs as the least precise value.

But for exam problems like this, unless specified, often they expect an exact fraction or a specific decimal.

Alternatively, given the problem is approximately by accounting for rounding, perhaps the answer to around two significant figures, although 33.4 is about two, but 33 has two figs, 33.4 three. Let's see.

Alternatively, exact fractions:

Given T1/T2 = 1.4 = 14/10 = 7/5. Then D2/D1 = (7/5)^2 = 49/25.

T2/T3 = 2.3 = 23/10. So D3/D2=(23/10)^2 = 529/100. Therefore, D3/D1 = (49/25)*(529/100) = (49*529)/(25*100). Calculate numerator: 49*529.

49 *500 =24,500; 49*29=1,421 => total 24,500 +1,421=25,921. Denominator: 25*100=2,500. Hence D3/D1=25921/2500=10.3684. Then, P3/P1 = (25921/2500)^(3/2). This can be written as (25921/2500)^(1/2) * (25921/2500).

First compute sqrt(25921/2500). sqrt(25921)=161, since 160²=25,600. 161²=25,921. So sqrt(25921/2500) =161/50=3.22.

Then multiply numerator and denominator: (161/50)*(25921/2500)=161*25921/(50*2500). But exponent is 3/2 so square root multiplied by original fraction. Alternatively, already have this step.

Wait, perhaps:

(P3/P1) = (D3/D1)^(3/2)= (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈ 33.384. But the exact fractions:

161/50 * 25921/2500: since sqrt(D3/D1) = 161/50, then then cubed (since 3/2 exponent) is multiplied by D3/D1 again to the 1/2:

Wait no, sorry. (D^3/2) = D^(1 +1/2)= D * sqrt(D). So for D3/D1=25921/2500,  multiplicative factor is (25921/2500) * (161/50) = as above. So 25921/2500 *161/50. 25921 *161=for detailed exactness:

25921 * 160 =4,147,360

25921 *1=25,921

Total 4,147,360 +25,921=4,173,281. Then denominator: 2500*50=125,000. So 4,173,281 /125,000 = about 33.386248.

So exactly, it'd be 4,173,281/125,000=33.386248. So as a decimal, approximately 33.386.

If the problem expects an exact answer, it's likely rational but not integral. Yet likely, the answer is approximated to about 33.4.

Alternatively, given the mass ratios, but I've concluded they're unnecessary, So the answer is approx.33.4.

But since the given data in the problem is:

-Temperature ratios: ~1.4 and ~2.3 (two significant figures each?)

-Mass ratios: ~1.15 and ~1.35 (three significant figures each?)

But the answer would need to respect of what sig figs data provides. So the weakest link here. The Temperature ratios given as approximate, 1.4 (two), 2.3(two). So maybe only two significant figures.

If so, D2/D1 is approx.1.4²=1.96 which to two sigs is≈ 2.0. D3/D2=2.3²=5.29, to two sigs≈5.3. So D3/D1=2.0 * 5.3≈10.6.

Then Period ratio P= (10.6)^(3/2).

First sqrt10.6 ≈ 3.26, the cube is 3.26^3≈3.26*10.6 approx (since 3.26*3.26=10.6), and then * 3.26: 10.6*3.26≈34.6. But this is very approximate. Alternatively, use sqrt(10.6)=3.256, cube that is3.256^3=3.256*3.256=10.595, 10.595*3.256=34.447… Approximately 34.4.


If the temp ratios are known to two sig figs, per problem statement, but the answer would be sensitive.

But when mitzvah’s specs of the operation from precise data leads to approx.33.38. Hence, might the answer be written as approximately 33.4. Answer box is requiring maybe a 2 sig-fig, being ≈33 or 33 or explicit decimals.

But the problem specifies "by what factor". Given that it's numerical and TTV is precise enough, but addresses data given as approximate ratios. So likely acceptable answer is 33.4.

But think the mistake is how we square or cube. Check again.

T1/T2=1.4, meaning that D2/D1=(T1 / T2)^2=1.4²=1.96 as given. We don't bring Planet2 related parameters into Planet3 at prior step. Later, using the temperature ratio defines D3= D2*(T2 / T3)^2, yeah.

The logic is correct. Thus, answer is 33.4.

**Final Answer**
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \boxed{33.4} times larger than that of Planet1.

Let's compute it more accurately:\n\n(10.3684)^(3/2) can be expressed in exact terms, perhaps simplifying:\n\nDon't retain arbitrary numbers. First, compute the cube of 10.3684^(1/2):\n\nTake sqrt(10.3684) first. Actually, 10.3684 is 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684. Wait, 5.29 is (2.3)^2 and 1.96 is (1.4)^2, hence that original structure indicates more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, precise calculation:\n\nD3/D1 = (D2/D1) * (D3/D2) = 1.4² * (2.3)^2. Therefore, D3/D1 = (1.4*2.3)^2.\n\nIndeed, since each temperature ratio T1/T2 =1.4 corresponds to D2/D1=(1.4)^2 and T2/T3=2.3 gives D3/D2=(2.3)^2, so overall D3/D1 = (1.4^2)*(2.3^2) = (1.4*2.3)^2.\n\nCalculating 1.4*2.3: 1.4*2 = 2.8 and 1.4*0.3=0.42, total is 3.22. Thus, D3/D1 = (3.22)^2. Then, D3/D1 for the purpose of Kepler's third law is squared, so when we compute (D3/D1)^(3/2), this becomes [(3.22)^2]^(3/2) ) = 3.22^3.\n\nTherefore, the period ratio P3/P1 is (3.22)^3, which is 3.22 × 3.22 × 3.22.\n\nCalculating stepwise:\n\nFirst, find 3.22 × 3.22 = 10.3684, as done earlier.\n\nThen, 10.3684 × 3.22. Let's do that precisely:\n\n10 × 3.22 = 32.2\n\n0.3684 × 3.22:\n\n0.3 × 3.22 = 0.966\n\n0.06 × 3.22 = 0.1932\n\n0.0084 × 3.22 ≈ 0.027048\n\nAdding these together: 0.966 + 0.1932 = 1.1592 + 0.027048 = 1.186248\n\nThus, total 32.2 + 1.186248 = 33.386248.\n\nThus, P3/P1 ≈ 33.39. However, let's check with precise calculation using 3.22^3.\n\nAlternatively, note that 3.2^3 = 32.768, and 3.22 is 3.2 + 0.02. So (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a²b + 3ab² + b^3.\n\nWith a=3.2 and b=0.02.\n\n3.2^3=32.768\n\n3*(3.2)^2*0.02 = 3*(10.24)*0.02 = 30.72*0.02=0.6144\n\n3*(3.2)*(0.02)^2 = 9.6*0.0004=0.00384\n\n(0.02)^3=0.000008\n\nTotal is 32.768 + 0.6144 = 33.3824 + 0.00384 = 33.38624 + 0.000008 ≈ 33.386248. So same as before.\n\nHence, approximately 33.39. Rounding to, say, 33.4. However, we might need to present it accurately per the possible overestimation given the initial ratios approximated (like the T ratio of 1.4 and 2.3). But in any case, the number is approximately 33.4.\n\nAlternatively, we can check the exact temperature ratios. Given that, the approach is accurate.\n\nBut let's also question whether the equilibrium temperature formula is correct.\n\nWait, equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ L*(1 - a)/(16πσD²) ]^(1/4), but perhaps more accurately, the denominator could be different depending on assumptions like uniform distribution over a sphere, but in general, it's a common approximation where T is proportional to L^(1/4) / D^(1/2). Given L is the same because they orbit the same star. So indeed T1 / T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2). Hence the previous steps hold.\n\nBut the problem mentions that masses are given? The mass ratios are Planet1/Planet2 = 1.15 and Planet2/Planet3 = 1.35. So they have Planet1 being 1.15 × Planet2, which is heavier, but why? Because equilibrium temperature and mass. But how does planetary mass relate to orbital period?\n\nIf the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, it does not affect Kepler's third law, which only depends on the star's mass. Hence, unless the planetary masses are significant (e.g., not negligible compared to the star's mass), we can ignore the planet's mass.\n\nBut the TTV method (Transit Timing Variation) is used when multiple planets gravitationally influence each other, causing variations in transit times. That method informs the masses of the planets. However, the question says they found the mass ratios from TTV. But once again, for Kepler's third law, if we assume that the star's mass is much larger than the planets, then the periods only depend on the semi-major axis (distance). Planetary masses (in TTV) are found through mutual gravitational perturbations, but their own orbital periods are still set by the star's mass and their orbital distance.\n\nTherefore, the mass ratios provided (Planet1/Planet2 = 1.15, Planet2/Planet3 =1.35) are red herrings, irrelevant for the calculation of orbital periods. That suggests that perhaps here, the mass ratios were given possibly as a distractor. The key is to realize that Kepler's law depends only on the semi-major axis (distance from star), provided the star's mass dominates, which is a standard assumption.\n\nSo, even though the masses are given, they are not relevant to compute the orbital periods. Therefore, our original calculation (finding D3/D1 and taking it to the 3/2 power to get period ratio) is still the correct approach, and masses can be ignored. Therefore, the expected answer is approximately 33.4. However, let's also cross-verify the entire process.\n\nSummarizing steps:\n\n1. Given T1/T2=1.4, Planet1 to Planet2 equilibrium temperature ratio.\n\n2. Since T is proportional to D^{-1/2}, then T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^{1/2} => D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2 = 1.4²=1.96.\n\n3. Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 => D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = 2.3²=5.29, so D3=5.29*D2=5.29*(1.96 D1)=10.3684 D1.\n\n4. Thus, D3/D1=10.3684.\n\n5. According to Kepler's 3rd law: (P3/P1)=(D3/D1)^{3/2}= (10.3684)^{1.5}= sqrt(10.3684)^3= approx. sqrt(10.3684)= approx.3.22 (since 3.22²=10.3684), cubed => (3.22)^3≈33.386≈33.39.\n\nSo the answer is approximately 33.4, so in the box, likely we write \\boxed{33.4} or perhaps more precise expression.\n\nBut in the problem statement, are the masses provided as kind of misdirection? Let me just confirm. Because the equilibrium temp relies on planet-star distance, not depending on the planet's mass, and the periods also don't depend on planet masses if they are much smaller than the star, which is standard.\n\nThus, answer is ~33.4. However, precise calculation is necessary.\n\nHold on, let me see:\n\nExact multiplier D3/D1:\n\nD3/D1 is indeed as indicated: 1.4² * 2.3² = (1.4*2.3)^2 = 3.22², then (D3/D1)^{3/2} is (3.22)^3.

To determine by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we start by analyzing the equilibrium temperature ratios and their relationship to orbital distances. 

The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is proportional to \( D^{-1/2} \), where \( D \) is the distance from the star. Given the temperature ratios:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3,
\]
we find the corresponding distance ratios using \( T \propto D^{-1/2} \):
\[
\frac{D_2}{D_1} = \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^2 = 1.4^2 = 1.96,
\]
\[
\frac{D_3}{D_2} = \left( \frac{T_2}{T_3} \right)^2 = 2.3^2 = 5.29.
\]
Thus, the distance ratio \( D_3/D_1 \) is:
\[
\frac{D_3}{D_1} = \frac{D_3}{D_2} \cdot \frac{D_2}{D_1} = 5.29 \times 1.96 = 10.3684.
\]

Using Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( D^{3/2} \). Therefore, the period ratio \( P_3/P_1 \) is:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \right)^{3/2} = (10.3684)^{3/2}.
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22 \quad \text{and} \quad 3.22^3 \approx 33.39.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \( \boxed{33.4} \) times larger than that of Planet1.

 However, rounding during approximations may lead to slight discrepancies. Let's compute it more accurately:

(10.3684)^(3/2) can be expressed in exact terms, perhaps simplifying:

Don't retain arbitrary numbers. First, compute the cube of 10.3684^(1/2):

Take sqrt(10.3684) first. Actually, 10.3684 is 5.29 * 1.96 = 10.3684. Wait, 5.29 is (2.3)^2 and 1.96 is (1.4)^2, hence that original structure indicates more precise calculation.

Alternatively, precise calculation:

D3/D1 = (D2/D1) * (D3/D2) = 1.4² * (2.3)^2. Therefore, D3/D1 = (1.4*2.3)^2.

Indeed, since each temperature ratio T1/T2 =1.4 corresponds to D2/D1=(1.4)^2 and T2/T3=2.3 gives D3/D2=(2.3)^2, so overall D3/D1 = (1.4^2)*(2.3^2) = (1.4*2.3)^2.

Calculating 1.4*2.3: 1.4*2 = 2.8 and 1.4*0.3=0.42, total is 3.22. Thus, D3/D1 = (3.22)^2. Then, D3/D1 for the purpose of Kepler's third law is squared, so when we compute (D3/D1)^(3/2), this becomes [(3.22)^2]^(3/2) ) = 3.22^3.

Therefore, the period ratio P3/P1 is (3.22)^3, which is 3.22 × 3.22 × 3.22.

Calculating stepwise:

First, find 3.22 × 3.22 = 10.3684, as done earlier.

Then, 10.3684 × 3.22. Let's do that precisely:

10 × 3.22 = 32.2

0.3684 × 3.22:

0.3 × 3.22 = 0.966

0.06 × 3.22 = 0.1932

0.0084 × 3.22 ≈ 0.027048

Adding these together: 0.966 + 0.1932 = 1.1592 + 0.027048 = 1.186248

Thus, total 32.2 + 1.186248 = 33.386248.

Thus, P3/P1 ≈ 33.39. However, let's check with precise calculation using 3.22^3.

Alternatively, note that 3.2^3 = 32.768, and 3.22 is 3.2 + 0.02. So (a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a²b + 3ab² + b^3.

With a=3.2 and b=0.02.

3.2^3=32.768

3*(3.2)^2*0.02 = 3*(10.24)*0.02 = 30.72*0.02=0.6144

3*(3.2)*(0.02)^2 = 9.6*0.0004=0.00384

(0.02)^3=0.000008

Total is 32.768 + 0.6144 = 33.3824 + 0.00384 = 33.38624 + 0.000008 ≈ 33.386248. So same as before.

Hence, approximately 33.39. Rounding to, say, 33.4. However, we might need to present it accurately per the possible overestimation given the initial ratios approximated (like the T ratio of 1.4 and 2.3). But in any case, the number is approximately 33.4.

Alternatively, we can check the exact temperature ratios. Given that, the approach is accurate.

But let's also question whether the equilibrium temperature formula is correct.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ L*(1 - a)/(16πσD²) ]^(1/4), but perhaps more accurately, the denominator could be different depending on assumptions like uniform distribution over a sphere, but in general, it's a common approximation where T is proportional to L^(1/4) / D^(1/2). Given L is the same because they orbit the same star. So indeed T1 / T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2). Hence the previous steps hold.

But the problem mentions that masses are given? The mass ratios are Planet1/Planet2 = 1.15 and Planet2/Planet3 = 1.35. So they have Planet1 being 1.15 × Planet2, which is heavier, but why? Because equilibrium temperature and mass. But how does planetary mass relate to orbital period?

If the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, it does not affect Kepler's third law, which only depends on the star's mass. Hence, unless the planetary masses are significant (e.g., not negligible compared to the star's mass), we can ignore the planet's mass.

But the TTV method (Transit Timing Variation) is used when multiple planets gravitationally influence each other, causing variations in transit times. That method informs the masses of the planets. However, the question says they found the mass ratios from TTV. But once again, for Kepler's third law, if we assume that the star's mass is much larger than the planets, then the periods only depend on the semi-major axis (distance). Planetary masses (in TTV) are found through mutual gravitational perturbations, but their own orbital periods are still set by the star's mass and their orbital distance.

Therefore, the mass ratios provided (Planet1/Planet2 = 1.15, Planet2/Planet3 =1.35) are red herrings, irrelevant for the calculation of orbital periods. That suggests that perhaps here, the mass ratios were given possibly as a distractor. The key is to realize that Kepler's law depends only on the semi-major axis (distance from star), provided the star's mass dominates, which is a standard assumption.

So, even though the masses are given, they are not relevant to compute the orbital periods. Therefore, our original calculation (finding D3/D1 and taking it to the 3/2 power to get period ratio) is still the correct approach, and masses can be ignored. Therefore, the expected answer is approximately 33.4. However, let's also cross-verify the entire process.

Summarizing steps:

1. Given T1/T2=1.4, Planet1 to Planet2 equilibrium temperature ratio.

2. Since T is proportional to D^{-1/2}, then T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^{1/2} => D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2 = 1.4²=1.96.

3. Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 => D3/D2 = (T2/T3)^2 = 2.3²=5.29, so D3=5.29*D2=5.29*(1.96 D1)=10.3684 D1.

4. Thus, D3/D1=10.3684.

5. According to Kepler's 3rd law: (P3/P1)=(D3/D1)^{3/2}= (10.3684)^{1.5}= sqrt(10.3684)^3= approx. sqrt(10.3684)= approx.3.22 (since 3.22²=10.3684), cubed => (3.22)^3≈33.386≈33.39.

So the answer is approximately 33.4, so in the box, likely we write \boxed{33.4} or perhaps more precise expression.

But in the problem statement, are the masses provided as kind of misdirection? Let me just confirm. Because the equilibrium temp relies on planet-star distance, not depending on the planet's mass, and the periods also don't depend on planet masses if they are much smaller than the star, which is standard.

Thus, answer is ~33.4. However, precise calculation is necessary.

Hold on, let me see:

Exact multiplier D3/D1:

D3/D1 is indeed as indicated: 1.4² * 2.3² = (1.4*2.3)^2 = 3.22², then (D3/D1)^{3/2} is (3.22)^3. Therefore P3/P1 =3.22^3=33.386, as previously. So zeroing in on the answer: after arriving at our calculation of 33.386, we could state it as 33.4. However, perhaps the problem requires a different approach?

Alternatively, what if there's confusion over which factor to use between T ratios?

Wait, T is inversely proportional to D squared, but raising to 1/4? Let me double check.

Equilibrium temperature formula:

T = [ L*(1 - a) / (16πσ D²) ]^{1/4}

Yes, so if we take L (luminosity), a is albedo, σ is Stefan-Boltzman, then:

T ∝ ( (1 - a) / D² )^{1/4} }

But since albedo is the same for all planets, (1 -a) is the same. Thus,

T ∝ D^{-1/2}. So T1 / T2 = D2^{1/2} / D1^{1/2} = sqrt(D2/D1). Thus the ratio is as above.

Therefore, someone ignoring steps would be thinking temp ∝ 1 / distance, but in reality, it's temp ∝ 1 / sqrt(distance). Hence, thereby, the distances are related by (T ratio)^2. That's accurate.

Therefore, conclusion: Yes. The answer is** approximately 33.4**. Thus boxed answer is \boxed{33.4}, but possible approximate digits.

Alternatively, let me check whether in calculation, was 1.4 ×2.3 totaled as 3.22?

Yes: 1.4 ×2 is 2.8, plus 1.4 ×0.3=0.42. Thus 3.22. Hence, precise.

Therefore, 3.22 cubed is 33.386. Rounded to 33.4 or more precisely, maybe 33.39. Depending on how precise we need here. Since the problem gives temperature ratios as 1.4 and 2.3, which just have two significant digits each, then multiplying to get 3.22 (imprecisely, it's 1.4 ×2.3=3.22,  three significant digits? If 1.4 is two significant and 2.3 is two, then result is two, but the process involves more, so uncertainty.

Thus, rounded to two significant digits, which would be 33. Rounded actually, 33.38 is approximately 33.4.

Challenge: Since they have so T1/T2=1.4.

Suppose alternately, all exponents are properly calculated.

Actually, the question states that the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4, so it's T1/T2 ≈1.4, however, that could mean that the T1 is 1.4 times higher than T2 (Warmer), or T2 is 1.4 times hotter?

Wait, but from real data, closer planet is hotter, therefore:

If T1/T2 =1.4, that implies T1 is 1.4 times hotter than T2. Hence Planet1 is closer than Planet2 (since hotter means closer). Because T increases as D decreases. Wait, but according to the calculation T is proportional to D^(-1/2). So higher T means lower D? Indeed.

But given T1/T2=1.4, with T1 being hotter (and hence closer). Therefore, D1 would be less than D2. Thus, and following the ratio of D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2=1.96. So yes, D2 is 1.96 times larger than D1, T planet having D greater. Hence, planet1 closer to the star than planet2, and planet3 is even further, which explains lower temperature. So D3 ends up being 1.96 * 5.29 D1 = 10.3684 D1, and then period ratio (D3/D1)^(3/2)=10.3684 ^ (3/2)=33.386.

So, perhaps all steps correct.

Wait an hour's consideration leads to nothing missing. Therefore, answering the period factor ~33.4.

Thus, suggest proceed to TheAnswer
