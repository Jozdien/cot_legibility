# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine the relative speed and the total energy of the system involving two astronauts with masses \(2m\) and \(3m\) traveling at relativistic speeds of \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\) respectively, we proceed as follows:

### Relative Speed Calculation:
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the Einstein velocity addition formula:
\[
v_{\text{relative}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]
where \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\). Plugging in the values:
\[
v_{\text{relative}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
\]

### Total Energy Calculation:
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is given by \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = \frac{5}{2}mc^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 2\sqrt{3}mc^2
\]

Total energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = \frac{5}{2}mc^2 + 2\sqrt{3}mc^2 = \left( \frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right)mc^2
\]

### Final Answers:
- The relative speed is \(\boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}\).
- The total energy of the system is \(\boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}\).

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Let me try to break it down and figure out how to solve it. The question is asking for the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction, so they’re going the same way. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively. 

First, relative speed. Hmm, in classical mechanics, if two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is just the difference between their speeds. So that would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, right? So the formula for relative velocity isn’t just a simple subtraction because velocities don't add linearly when you get close to the speed of light. Instead, we have to use the Einstein velocity addition formula. 

The Einstein formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Let me double-check that. If I’m in the rest frame of one astronaut, say the one moving at 0.5c, then the other astronaut’s speed relative to me would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me calculate the denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the numerator is 0.1c, and then divided by 0.7. So that would be (0.1/0.7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.1428c. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me confirm the formula again. If observer S sees an object moving at u, and S is moving at v relative to S', then the velocity in S' is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). Yes, that seems correct. So with u = 0.6c and v = 0.5c, the formula gives (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So I think that's correct. So that's the relative speed. 

But wait, actually, the problem specifies the astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. So the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. If we want the speed of one relative to the other, we have to choose a frame. Let's pick the rest frame of the 3m astronaut (the one moving at 0.5c). Then we need to calculate the speed of the 2m astronaut (0.6c) relative to that frame. So using the velocity addition formula. Yep, that's what I did above. Alternatively, if we wanted the speed of the 3m astronaut relative to the 2m one, we might get a different value. Wait, but the problem says "relative speed". Depending on interpretation, the relative speed should be the same in either direction, but actually, is that true in relativity? Wait, no, the relative speed is frame-dependent? Or is it the magnitude that's the same?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Velocity is relative, so if from the rest frame of astronaut A, astronaut B is moving at 0.1428c, and from the rest frame of astronaut B, astronaut A is moving at -0.1428c. So the relative speed is the same, but direction is opposite. But since speed is scalar, the relative speed would just be 0.1428c. So I think maybe that is correct. So as per the calculation, relative speed is about 0.1428c, which is approximately 1/7th of c, or exactly 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. Wait, 0.1/0.7 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428, yes.

Okay, so relative speed seems to be (0.6 - 0.5)c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c.

Now for the total energy of the system. That’s probably in the original frame where both astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, right? So the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma times m c squared. So each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c², with gamma being 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, calculate gamma for each astronaut.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c): gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Then total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.4641 m c² ≈ 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.964 m c². But maybe they want an exact expression instead of a decimal approximation. Let's compute the exact terms.

Starting with gamma1: 0.6^2 = 0.36; 1 - 0.36 = 0.64; sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma1 = 1 / 0.8 = 5/4 = 1.25. So that's exact.

For E1, it's therefore (5/4) * 2m c² = (5/2)m c² = 2.5 m c². Exact value.

Gamma2: 0.5^2 = 0.25; 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(3/4) = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So gamma2 = 1/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. Rationalizing the denominator, gamma2 = 2√3 / 3. Therefore, E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = (2√3 / 3) * 3m c² = 2√3 m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c². So exact value is 2√3 m c².

Therefore, total energy is (5/2)m c² + 2√3 m c². Which can be written as m c² (5/2 + 2√3). Calculating numerically, 5/2 is 2.5 and 2√3 ≈ 3.464, so total is approximately 5.964 m c². 

But maybe the question wants it in terms of exact expressions. If it's acceptable, then 5/2 m c² + 2√3 m c² is the exact total energy. 

Alternatively, we could factor out m c² and write E_total = m c² (5/2 + 2√3). But not sure if they need decimals or exact form.

Let me check the question again. It says "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So maybe we need to write both answers in boxed notation. Let me verify. The problem mentions "relativistic speeds", so using the relativistic addition formula was correct for the relative speed, and for the total energy, sum of relativistic energies.

Alternatively, if they mean the total energy in the center of momentum frame? Wait, but the problem didn't specify the frame. But since both velocities are given in the positive x-direction, that seems to imply that they are in the same frame (e.g., the rest frame of the observer who sees them moving at 0.6c and 0.5c). Therefore, the total energy in that frame would indeed be the sum of their individual relativistic energies. So that seems correct.

Is there a better way to present the relative speed? Since 0.1 / 0.7 is 1/7, so 1/7 is approximately 0.1428, but maybe they want it as (1/7)c? Wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is not exactly 1/7. Let's see: 0.1 / 0.7 = 1/10 divided by 7/10 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. So in exact terms, it's c/7. But wait: let me compute 0.1/0.7:

0.1 / 0.7 = (1/10) / (7/10) )= 1/10 * 10/7 = 1/7. So actually, it's exactly (1/7)c, which is approximately 0.1428c. So 1/7 is approximately 0.142857. So exact value is c/7. Wait, is that correct? Because 0.6 - 0.5 is 0.1, which in numerator, and denominator is 1 - (0.6)(0.5) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So numerator is 0.1, denominator 0.7. So 0.1/0.7 = 1/7, exactly. Therefore, the relative speed is exactly (1/7)c, which is approximately 0.1428c. Therefore, we can write exactly c/7.

But is c/7 the exact value? Let me check:

Yes, because initial calculation yields 0.1 / 0.7 = 1/7.

Therefore, relative speed is exactly (1/7)c. Cool. That's a better answer, more precise. So the first part is c/7, which is approximately 0.1428c. Cool. The problem mentions "the relative speed and the total energy of the system." So the relative speed is c/7, exactly, and the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3) mc². That's exact. Otherwise, an approximate decimal could be like 5.964 mc². Depending on what they want, but given that masses are given as 2m and 3m, probably factors of m c squared, and exact terms using square roots.

Therefore, compiling the answers:

Relative speed: c/7

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3) mc²

Alternatively, factor out the mc².

Alternatively, someone might think to use the invariant mass of the system? Wait, total energy includes the kinetic energies plus rest mass energy, but total energy and momentum are conserved. Hmm, but when you're asked for the total energy of the system in a specific frame, you just sum up the energies in that frame, which is what we did here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant mass (rest mass) of the system? But the problem says total energy, so probably in the given frame. The problem doesn't specify the frame, but since the velocities are given as being in the positive x-direction, the natural frame is that of the observer who measures them at 0.6c and 0.5c. Therefore, our calculation is correct.

So I think the answers are:

Relative speed: c/7

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3) mc²

Converting these into decimals if needed: c/7 ≈ 0.1428c, and the energy would be ≈5.964 mc². But likely exact form preferred.

Let me check units. If m is mass, then the total energy is in units of mc², which is appropriate. So 5/2 + 2√3 is a scalar multiplier. So we can just present the answer as E = (5/2 + 2√3) m c². Wait, but astronaut masses are 2m and 3m. Should the energy be written as?

Wait, astronaut 1 has mass 2m. So energy is gamma1 * m1 c², where m1 =2m. Similarly, astronaut 2: gamma2* m2 c², with m2=3m. So yes, m1 is 2m and m2 is 3m. Then, correctly, their energies are 5/2 m c² and 2√3 m c², because:

For m1=2m: gamma1=5/4 (from 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36)=5/4), so energy is (5/4) * 2m c² = (5/2) m c².

For m2=3m: gamma2=2/sqrt(3), so (2/sqrt(3))*3m c² = (6/sqrt(3)) m c² = 2√3 m c². Right. So total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c². 

Thus, the exact answer is that. So how precise does the problem want? If they want exact terms, we can leave it as that, though maybe if the question expects simplification, but I think what we've done is right. 

Alternatively, let me check if I messed up m vs m1 and m2. The problem says astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So their rest masses are 2m and 3m, hence their relativistic energies are gamma1 * 2m c² and gamma2 *3m c².

Therefore, yes, E1=2m c² / sqrt(1 - 0.36)= 2m c² / 0.8= 2m c² * 5/4= 5/2 m c².

Similarly, E2=3m c² / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 3m c² / (sqrt(0.75))=3m c² * 2/sqrt(3)= sqrt(3)*2 m c²=2√3 m c².

Hence adding together gives E_total = (5/2 + 2√3) m c². So that’s the exact answer.

So the relative speed is c/7, total energy is (5/2 + 2√3) m c². So waiting for code implementation. To present answers. So final answers would be:

Relative speed: \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}

Total energy: \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}

Alternatively, if the problem didn’t use m as a variable but in general terms, but given that the problem says masses are 2m and 3m, so it's correct.

Yes, I think that is the right approach.

**Final Answer**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.

I have this physics problem concerning two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm trying to understand how to solve it. The question asks for the relative speed and total energy of the system. Both astronauts are traveling in the positive x-direction, with masses of 2m and 3m, and speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively.

For the relative speed, in classical mechanics, I would simply subtract their speeds: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. However, since this is a relativistic problem, velocities don't combine linearly when approaching light speed. Instead, I need to apply Einstein's velocity addition formula.

The correct formula for relative velocity when objects move in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). If I use the rest frame of the astronaut moving at 0.5c, then the other astronaut's relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Calculating the denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c, so divided by 0.7, I get (0.1/0.7)c ≈ 0.1428c.

Let me verify this calculation. If observer S sees an object moving at u, and S is moving at v relative to S', then the velocity in S' is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). With u = 0.6c and v = 0.5c, the formula gives (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c.

The problem specifies both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction, with the first astronaut at 0.6c and the second at 0.5c. To find one's speed relative to the other, I need to choose a reference frame. Using the rest frame of the 3m astronaut (traveling at 0.5c), I calculate the speed of the 2m astronaut (0.6c) relative to that frame using the velocity addition formula. Alternatively, I could calculate the speed of the 3m astronaut relative to the 2m one, which might yield a different value. However, I'm wondering if "relative speed" in relativity is frame-dependent or if it's the magnitude.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I have a physics problem involving two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to dissect it to find a solution. The task is to calculate both the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction, in the same direction. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively.

Let's first tackle the relative speed. In classical mechanics, when two objects move in the same direction, the relative speed is simply the difference between their speeds, which would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. However, this scenario involves relativity, which means we can't just apply simple subtraction since velocities near the speed of light don't add linearly. Instead, we must use Einstein's velocity addition formula.

The Einstein formula for calculating relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Let me verify this. If I assume the rest frame of one astronaut, say the one moving at 0.5c, then the speed of the other astronaut relative to me should be calculated as (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Working through the calculation, the denominator becomes: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. Therefore, the numerator is 0.1c, and when I divide by 0.7, it becomes (0.1/0.7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So, the relative speed is approximately 0.1428c. Wait, that seems off. Let me verify the formula once more. If observer S sees an object moving at u, and S is moving at v relative to S', the velocity in S' is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). With u = 0.6c and v = 0.5c, the formula yields (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. That seems correct. So, that’s the relative speed.

However, considering the problem specifies the astronauts are heading in the positive x-direction, the first astronaut moves at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. To find one astronaut's speed relative to the other, we need a specific frame of reference. Let's choose the rest frame of the 3m astronaut (moving at 0.5c). Then we calculate the speed of the 2m astronaut (0.6c) relative to that frame using the velocity addition formula. Indeed, that’s what I calculated earlier. On the other hand, if we calculate the speed of the 3m astronaut relative to the 2m astronaut, the outcome might differ. But since the problem states "relative speed," one might think it should be invariant across directions; yet, in relativity, could it be frame-dependent? Wait, is it the magnitude...

Wait, no, in special relativity, speeds are frame-dependent, but relative speed between two objects should be the same regardless of the frame you\'re observing from? Wait, actually, that\'s not the case. If you have two objects moving in the same direction, depending on which frame you’re in, their relative speed would be different. But the question is phrased as "the relative speed of the system". Maybe the problem is expecting the relative speed as observed from a rest frame? Wait, maybe I\'m overcomplicating.

Since in that case, the relative speed is unique for each astronaut. So the problem probably expects us to calculate the velocity of one astronaut in the rest frame of the other. The standard approach is to use the velocity addition formula. Since astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. If we want the speed of astronaut A as seen from astronaut B\'s rest frame, which is moving at 0.5c relative to the original frame, then we use u = 0.6c, v = 0.5c. Apply the formula: u’ = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So that’s correct, right? Alternatively, is there another interpretation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering their relative speed as seen from the original frame. But in the original frame, they have speeds 0.6c and 0.5c, so the relative speed is just 0.1c. But since it\'s stated as relativistic, maybe it\'s expecting the relativistic formula? But in the original frame, their relative speed is straightforward. However, objects moving at different speeds have their separation increasing at 0.1c in the original frame. But when they say "relative speed," that could be about the speed of one in the rest frame of the other.\n\nI need to check that. For example, in relativity, relative velocity can be tricky because of the different frames. If they\'re asking for the speed of astronaut 1 as seen from astronaut 2\'s rest frame, that would be the 0.1428c. Conversely, the speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1 would be different? Let me check that. So, if astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, then from astronaut 1\'s frame, the speed of astronaut 2 (which is moving at 0.5c in the original frame) would be calculated using u’ = (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Wait, if in the original frame S, astronaut 2 has velocity v = 0.5c, and the astronaut 1 is moving at u = 0.6c. Then switching to the rest frame of astronaut 1 (S\'), which is moving at 0.6c relative to S, the speed of astronaut 2 in S\' would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = -0.1c/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is the same, but direction is opposite. Hence, the relative speed is the same in both frames, 0.1428c, but direction depends on the frame. However, since speed is a scalar, they might just want the magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the relative speed is approximately 0.1428c. To write this as a fraction, 0.1c divided by 0.7 is equal to 1/7 c ≈ 0.1428c. So 1/7 c. So perhaps the exact answer is (1/7)c, or approximately 0.1429c. But 0.1 divided by 0.7 is 1/7.\n\nSo relative speed is (1/7)c. Is that correct? Let me check with another example. If one object is moving at v and the other at u, then the relative speed viewed from the rest frame is |v - u| in classical, but in relativity, it\'s (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Wait, but only in the case when you are measuring one object\'s speed from the other\'s rest frame. So if u and v are in the same direction, then from the slower object\'s frame, the faster one is approaching at (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So in this case, faster astronaut is 0.6c and slower is 0.5c. From the slower\'s frame, the faster is moving away at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - 0.6*0.5) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 1/7 c ≈ 0.1428c. So yes, that\'s correct. Therefore, relative speed is (1/7)c.\n\nNow, moving to the second part: total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the energies of each object. Each object\'s energy is given by gamma times mass times c squared. So E_total = gamma1*m1*c² + gamma2*m2*c². Here, m1 is 2m and m2 is 3m. The velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c. So let\'s compute gamma for each.\n\nGamma for the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c):\n\nGamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nSo energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5m c².\n\nGamma for the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c):\n\nGamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547\n\nThen energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641m c².\n\nTherefore total energy E_total ≈ 2.5m c² + 3.4641m c² ≈ 5.9641m c².\n\nBut maybe we need exact expressions instead of decimal approximations. Let me compute gamma2 exactly.\n\nsqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) which is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So gamma2 is 1/(√3/2) = 2/√3 ≈ 1.1547. Thus, gamma2 is exactly 2/√3. Therefore E2 = 3m c² * (2/√3) = (6/√3)m c² = 2√3 m c². Since √3 ≈ 1.732, 2√3 ≈ 3.464.\n\nSimilarly, gamma1 was exact: 1 / 0.8 = 5/4 = 1.25, so E1 = 2m * (5/4) c² = (5/2)m c² = 2.5m c².\n\nTherefore, total energy E_total = (5/2 + 2√3) m c². That\'s exact. If we need a numerical coefficient, let\'s compute 5/2 + 2*1.732 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964. So approximately 5.964 m c². Depending on what the problem expects, maybe leave it in exact terms or approximate. The problem just says "total energy of the system". Since the masses are given as 2m and 3m, I think exact form would be better, in terms of square roots. So, combining those terms: 5/2 and 2√3, but perhaps over a common denominator? Not necessary. So (5/2 + 2√3) m c² is the exact total energy.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\nRelative speed is (1/7)c, and total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c².\n\nWait, but let me check again for correctness.\n\nFirst, relative speed. If I apply the formula (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). Given u = 0.6c, v = 0.5c. Plugging in:\n\nNumerator: u - v = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.\n\nDenominator: 1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.\n\nTherefore, relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. Correct.\n\nTotal energy. Each energy gamma*m*c². For 0.6c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1.25. Correct. So 1.25*2m*c² = 2.5 m c². Nice.\n\nFor 0.5c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Since 0.75 is 3/4, sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(3)/2. Thus gamma is 2/sqrt(3). Which is approximately 1.1547. Multiplying that by 3m c² gives 6/sqrt(3) m c². We can rationalize the denominator: 6/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(3) ≈ 3.464. Correct.\n\nSo, adding 2.5 and 3.464 gives about 5.964 m c², or exactly (5/2 + 2√3)m c². That seems right.\n\nIs there an alternative approach? If someone tried to calculate the total energy in the rest frame of one of the astronauts? But no, total energy in which frame? The problem just says "the total energy of the system". In the absence of a specified frame, it\'s usually assumed to be the lab frame or the original frame where their speeds are given. Since the problem states their speeds as 0.6c and 0.5c, which must be in some frame, likely the one we should use to compute the total energy.\n\nTherefore, all signs point to (1/7)c for relative speed and (5/2 + 2√3)m c² for total energy. I think that\'s the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe relative speed is \\boxed{\\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{5}{2} + 2\\sqrt{3} \\right) mc^2}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743814952, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3119, prompt_tokens=814, total_tokens=3933, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system, we use relativistic principles.

**Relative Speed Calculation:**
1. The astronauts are traveling at velocities \(0.6c\) and \(0.5c\) in the same direction.
2. Using the Einstein velocity addition formula, the relative speed \(u'\) of one astronaut as seen from the other's rest frame is calculated as:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\):
   \[
   u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
   \]

**Total Energy Calculation:**
1. The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).
2. For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
   \]
3. For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 2\sqrt{3}mc^2
   \]
4. The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 2\sqrt{3}mc^2 = \left( \frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right)mc^2
   \]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 in either frame? Wait, no, in special relativity, speeds are frame-dependent, but relative speed between two objects should be the same regardless of the frame you're observing from? Wait, actually, that's not the case. If you have two objects moving in the same direction, depending on which frame you’re in, their relative speed would be different. But the question is phrased as "the relative speed of the system". Maybe the problem is expecting the relative speed as observed from a rest frame? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again.

"Two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6 c and 0.5 c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Here, c is the speed of light. What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?"

The term "relative speed" probably refers to the speed of one astronaut as observed from the other's rest frame. Since in that case, the relative speed is unique for each astronaut. So the problem probably expects us to calculate the velocity of one astronaut in the rest frame of the other. The standard approach is to use the velocity addition formula. Since astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. If we want the speed of astronaut A as seen from astronaut B's rest frame, which is moving at 0.5c relative to the original frame, then we use u = 0.6c, v = 0.5c. Apply the formula: u’ = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So that’s correct, right? Alternatively, is there another interpretation?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering their relative speed as seen from the original frame. But in the original frame, they have speeds 0.6c and 0.5c, so the relative speed is just 0.1c. But since it's stated as relativistic, maybe it's expecting the relativistic formula? But in the original frame, their relative speed is straightforward. However, objects moving at different speeds have their separation increasing at 0.1c in the original frame. But when they say "relative speed," that could be about the speed of one in the rest frame of the other.

I need to check that. For example, in relativity, relative velocity can be tricky because of the different frames. If they're asking for the speed of astronaut 1 as seen from astronaut 2's rest frame, that would be the 0.1428c. Conversely, the speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1 would be different? Let me check that. So, if astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, then from astronaut 1's frame, the speed of astronaut 2 (which is moving at 0.5c in the original frame) would be calculated using u’ = (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Wait, if in the original frame S, astronaut 2 has velocity v = 0.5c, and the astronaut 1 is moving at u = 0.6c. Then switching to the rest frame of astronaut 1 (S'), which is moving at 0.6c relative to S, the speed of astronaut 2 in S' would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c)(0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = -0.1c/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So the magnitude is the same, but direction is opposite. Hence, the relative speed is the same in both frames, 0.1428c, but direction depends on the frame. However, since speed is a scalar, they might just want the magnitude.

Therefore, the relative speed is approximately 0.1428c. To write this as a fraction, 0.1c divided by 0.7 is equal to 1/7 c ≈ 0.1428c. So 1/7 c. So perhaps the exact answer is (1/7)c, or approximately 0.1429c. But 0.1 divided by 0.7 is 1/7.

So relative speed is (1/7)c. Is that correct? Let me check with another example. If one object is moving at v and the other at u, then the relative speed viewed from the rest frame is |v - u| in classical, but in relativity, it's (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²). Wait, but only in the case when you are measuring one object's speed from the other's rest frame. So if u and v are in the same direction, then from the slower object's frame, the faster one is approaching at (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So in this case, faster astronaut is 0.6c and slower is 0.5c. From the slower's frame, the faster is moving away at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - 0.6*0.5) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 1/7 c ≈ 0.1428c. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, relative speed is (1/7)c.

Now, moving to the second part: total energy of the system. Total energy in relativity is the sum of the energies of each object. Each object's energy is given by gamma times mass times c squared. So E_total = gamma1*m1*c² + gamma2*m2*c². Here, m1 is 2m and m2 is 3m. The velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c. So let's compute gamma for each.

Gamma for the first astronaut (2m, 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5m c².

Gamma for the second astronaut (3m, 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547

Then energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641m c².

Therefore total energy E_total ≈ 2.5m c² + 3.4641m c² ≈ 5.9641m c².

But maybe we need exact expressions instead of decimal approximations. Let me compute gamma2 exactly.

sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) which is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So gamma2 is 1/(√3/2) = 2/√3 ≈ 1.1547. Thus, gamma2 is exactly 2/√3. Therefore E2 = 3m c² * (2/√3) = (6/√3)m c² = 2√3 m c². Since √3 ≈ 1.732, 2√3 ≈ 3.464.

Similarly, gamma1 was exact: 1 / 0.8 = 5/4 = 1.25, so E1 = 2m * (5/4) c² = (5/2)m c² = 2.5m c².

Therefore, total energy E_total = (5/2 + 2√3) m c². That's exact. If we need a numerical coefficient, let's compute 5/2 + 2*1.732 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964. So approximately 5.964 m c². Depending on what the problem expects, maybe leave it in exact terms or approximate. The problem just says "total energy of the system". Since the masses are given as 2m and 3m, I think exact form would be better, in terms of square roots. So, combining those terms: 5/2 and 2√3, but perhaps over a common denominator? Not necessary. So (5/2 + 2√3) m c² is the exact total energy.

Therefore, putting it all together:

Relative speed is (1/7)c, and total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c².

Wait, but let me check again for correctness.

First, relative speed. If I apply the formula (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). Given u = 0.6c, v = 0.5c. Plugging in:

Numerator: u - v = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

Therefore, relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. Correct.

Total energy. Each energy gamma*m*c². For 0.6c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1.25. Correct. So 1.25*2m*c² = 2.5 m c². Nice.

For 0.5c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Since 0.75 is 3/4, sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(3)/2. Thus gamma is 2/sqrt(3). Which is approximately 1.1547. Multiplying that by 3m c² gives 6/sqrt(3) m c². We can rationalize the denominator: 6/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(3) ≈ 3.464. Correct.

So, adding 2.5 and 3.464 gives about 5.964 m c², or exactly (5/2 + 2√3)m c². That seems right.

Is there an alternative approach? If someone tried to calculate the total energy in the rest frame of one of the astronauts? But no, total energy in which frame? The problem just says "the total energy of the system". In the absence of a specified frame, it's usually assumed to be the lab frame or the original frame where their speeds are given. Since the problem states their speeds as 0.6c and 0.5c, which must be in some frame, likely the one we should use to compute the total energy.

Therefore, all signs point to (1/7)c for relative speed and (5/2 + 2√3)m c² for total energy. I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.

But in relativity, the relative speed depends on which frame you\'re in. But perhaps here, the problem expects the relative speed from the rest frame of one of the astronauts. Since they ask for "the relative speed", but don\'t specify, maybe it\'s just the velocity of one as seen from the other? \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a standard way the problem wants us to compute their relative velocity. Since the first is going faster than the second, their relative speed as seen by the slower one would be calculated, as above, 0.1428c. Alternatively, in earth\'s frame, is there a way to compute their separation speed? But Earth\'s frame would see one moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c, so the relative speed from Earth\'s frame would just be 0.1c, but that\'s classical and not correct since relativistic velocities don\'t add like that. Wait, but the problem could be interpreted as two different things: either (i) the speed of each astronaut in the rest frame of the other or (ii) the rate at which the distance between them increases in the Earth frame. The problem says "relative speed", which typically in physics can refer to how one object\'s speed is observed from the other\'s rest frame. So in that case, using the velocity addition formula is correct.\n\nYes, so since the second astronaut is moving at 0.5c relative to Earth, from their perspective, Earth is moving at -0.5c, and the first astronaut\'s velocity is 0.6c. So applying the velocity addition formula, which gives approximately 0.1428c. Alternatively, if we consider the first astronaut\'s frame, where they’re at rest, the second astronaut would appear to approach them with a velocity calculated by (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5*0.6)/1) = (-0.1c)/ (1 - 0.3) = -0.1c/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The speed being the magnitude, so 0.1428c in either case. So their relative speed is approximately 0.143c. But depending on how the problem expects the answer, maybe exact fraction? 0.1/0.7 is 1/7, which is approximately 0.1428, so it would be (1/7)c. Wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is 1/7, which is approximately 0.1428, so it\'s exactly (0.1)/(0.7) = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. So the relative speed is (1/7)c, or approximately 0.1429c.\n\nTherefore, the relative speed part would be c/7. Hopefully correct. Now the other part is "the total energy of the system". The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is gamma times m c squared. So for each astronaut, calculate gamma, then multiply by their respective masses, then add both.\n\nFor the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):\n\nGamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let’s compute gamma1:\n\nv = 0.6c => (v/c) = 0.6. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. Therefore, gamma1 = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So the energy of the first astronaut is gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².\n\nSecond astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):\n\nGamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = 1/(sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So exact value is 2/sqrt(3). Therefore, his energy is gamma2 * 3m c² = (2/sqrt(3)) * 3m c² = (6/sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c². sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 2*1.732 ≈ 3.464, so total energy is (2.5 + 3.464)m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². But expressed exactly.\n\nBut 2.5 m c² is 5/2 m c². The other term is 2 sqrt(3) m c², which is approximately 3.464 m c². However, to write the exact total energy, it would be the sum: (5/2 + 2√3) m c². Maybe combined into a single fraction? Let me check:\n\nThe first term is 5/2 m c², second term is 2√3 m c². So, sum is (5/2 + 2√3) m c². If we need to combine as a decimal approximation, it\'s approximately (2.5 + 3.464) m c² = 5.964 m c². So depending on how precise the answer should be, or expressed in exact terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want each individual energy stated and then the total. But the problem explicitly states "the total energy of the system," which would just be the sum of their individual relativistic energies.\n\nWait, but energy is frame-dependent. Hmm, here is a possible complication. Am I supposed to calculate the total energy in a particular frame? Since the problem didn\'t specify, it implies maybe in the "lab frame" which is presumably the frame where the speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c are given, i.e., the Earth frame. The problem says "two astronauts ... travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction." So that is in the Earth frame.

So the relative speed in terms of exact fraction is c/7. That\'s the exact answer, better to write fractions.

To determine the relative speed and total energy of the system for the two astronauts:

**Relative Speed**:  
Using Einstein's velocity addition formula, the relative speed of the astronauts as observed from one of their rest frames is calculated as:  
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
\]
Thus, the relative speed is **\( \frac{c}{7} \)**.

**Total Energy**:  
In the Earth frame, the total energy is the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy.  
For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):  
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = 1.25 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]
For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):  
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 = 2\sqrt{3}m c^2
\]
Total Energy:  
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = \left(\frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3}\right)mc^2
\]

**Final Answers**:  
- **Relative Speed**: \( \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} \)  
- **Total Energy**: \( \boxed{\left(\dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3}\right)mc^2} \)

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 Since relative speed would depend on the frame considered, which part the question is asking? 

Wait, the problem mentions "the relative speed". But in relativity, the relative speed depends on which frame you're in. But perhaps here, the problem expects the relative speed from the rest frame of one of the astronauts. Since they ask for "the relative speed", but don't specify, maybe it's just the velocity of one as seen from the other? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a standard way the problem wants us to compute their relative velocity. Since the first is going faster than the second, their relative speed as seen by the slower one would be calculated, as above, 0.1428c. Alternatively, in earth's frame, is there a way to compute their separation speed? But Earth's frame would see one moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c, so the relative speed from Earth's frame would just be 0.1c, but that's classical and not correct since relativistic velocities don't add like that. Wait, but the problem could be interpreted as two different things: either (i) the speed of each astronaut in the rest frame of the other or (ii) the rate at which the distance between them increases in the Earth frame. The problem says "relative speed", which typically in physics can refer to how one object's speed is observed from the other's rest frame. So in that case, using the velocity addition formula is correct.

Yes, so since the second astronaut is moving at 0.5c relative to Earth, from their perspective, Earth is moving at -0.5c, and the first astronaut's velocity is 0.6c. So applying the velocity addition formula, which gives approximately 0.1428c. Alternatively, if we consider the first astronaut's frame, where they’re at rest, the second astronaut would appear to approach them with a velocity calculated by (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5*0.6)/1) = (-0.1c)/ (1 - 0.3) = -0.1c/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The speed being the magnitude, so 0.1428c in either case. So their relative speed is approximately 0.143c. But depending on how the problem expects the answer, maybe exact fraction? 0.1/0.7 is 1/7, which is approximately 0.1428, so it would be (1/7)c. Wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is 1/7, which is approximately 0.1428, so it's exactly (0.1)/(0.7) = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857. So the relative speed is (1/7)c, or approximately 0.1429c.

Therefore, the relative speed part would be c/7. Hopefully correct. Now the other part is "the total energy of the system". The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is gamma times m c squared. So for each astronaut, calculate gamma, then multiply by their respective masses, then add both.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let’s compute gamma1:

v = 0.6c => (v/c) = 0.6. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. Therefore, gamma1 = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So the energy of the first astronaut is gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = 1/(sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547. So exact value is 2/sqrt(3). Therefore, his energy is gamma2 * 3m c² = (2/sqrt(3)) * 3m c² = (6/sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c². sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 2*1.732 ≈ 3.464, so total energy is (2.5 + 3.464)m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². But expressed exactly.

But 2.5 m c² is 5/2 m c². The other term is 2 sqrt(3) m c², which is approximately 3.464 m c². However, to write the exact total energy, it would be the sum: (5/2 + 2√3) m c². Maybe combined into a single fraction? Let me check:

The first term is 5/2 m c², second term is 2√3 m c². So, sum is (5/2 + 2√3) m c². If we need to combine as a decimal approximation, it's approximately (2.5 + 3.464) m c² = 5.964 m c². So depending on how precise the answer should be, or expressed in exact terms.

Alternatively, maybe they want each individual energy stated and then the total. But the problem explicitly states "the total energy of the system," which would just be the sum of their individual relativistic energies.

Wait, but energy is frame-dependent. Hmm, here is a possible complication. Am I supposed to calculate the total energy in a particular frame? Since the problem didn't specify, it implies maybe in the "lab frame" which is presumably the frame where the speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c are given, i.e., the Earth frame. The problem says "two astronauts ... travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction." So that is in the Earth frame. Thus, yes, calculating each energy in Earth's frame and adding them would be appropriate.

So yes, therefore, total energy as per Earth is (5/2 + 2√3) m c².

Alternatively, confirming the calculation:

Astronaut 1: γ = 1.25 → E = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c²

Astronaut 2: γ = 2/sqrt(3) ≈ 1.1547 → E = 3m * (2/sqrt(3)) c² = 6/sqrt(3) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c² (since 6/sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3))

Thus total energy: [2.5 + 2*1.732] m c² = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², but exact: (5/2 + 2√3) m c².

Alternatively, decimal approximation would round to something like 5.96 m c², but the problem may expect an exact answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem takes m as the rest mass. Wait, the masses are given as 2m and 3m, but in relativity, relativistic mass isn't used anymore. But sometimes in older texts, "relativistic mass" is used. However, in modern terms, "mass" refers to rest mass. So, the way the problem is phrased: the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So probably are giving their rest masses. Therefore, as in my previous calculation: Each astronaut's total energy is gamma times rest mass times c squared.

So first astronaut: rest mass 2m, moving at 0.6c → gamma=1.25, E1=2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: rest mass 3m, moving at 0.5c → gamma=2/sqrt(3) ≈1.1547, E2= 3* (2/sqrt(3)) m c²= 2 sqrt(3) m c². So indeed, total energy is 2.5 m c² + 2 sqrt(3) m c². Combining terms numerically: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². But whether exact or approximate.

Hence, the relative speed is c/7 and the total energy is (5/2 + 2√3)m c².

Perhaps I can write c/7 as (1/7)c. To check if c/7 is indeed the result of the velocity addition, with Earth frame speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c. Let's re-examine:

Using the velocity addition formula, the speed of A with respect to B is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²) where u is the speed of A in the Earth frame, and v is the speed of B in the Earth frame. Since in the rest frame of B, Earth is moving at -0.5c, and A is moving at 0.6c in Earth's frame, then the velocity is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - 0.6c*0.5c/c²) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c /0.7 = (1/7)c, so yeah, 1/7 c. So the relative speed in terms of exact fraction is c/7. That's the exact answer, better to write fractions. So for relative speed, we have c/7, which is approximately 0.1428c, so that's about 0.143 times speed of light.

So consolidating:

Relative speed: c/7

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)m c²

Alternatively, if the problem requires decimals, c/7 is about 0.1428c.

But both answers can be written in exact terms, fractions and exact radicals. Since the problem didn't specify, either way is okay, but in physics exams, exact forms are preferable unless they ask for numerical values.

Hence, the answer should be written as c/7 for the relative speed and (5/2 + 2√3)m c² for the total energy.

Let me make sure here that when we compute the speed in reverse, like from astronaut A's frame, the relative speed is same magnitude. Because if we compute the velocity of B (0.5c as per earth) as per A's frame, we set u = 0.5c, v = 0.6c, (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²) = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - 0.5*0.6) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = -c/7. The speed is the magnitude, so c/7, so the relative speed remains the same. Hence, that's correct.

So yes, the exact relative speed is indeed c/7.

Wait, the relative speed as a scalar should perhaps be the same. But technically, the relative velocity would have direction. The problem uses "relative speed," so the magnitude, which in this case would be (0.6c -0.5c)/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c regardless of frame? Wait no, that’s in the frame of the slower astronaut. The problem might be ambiguous if not clarified. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in relative speed calculations, in special relativity, relative speed isn’t simply the difference. Instead, each observer measures the other’s speed according to their own frame. Thus, from the perspective of each astronaut, they\'re at rest, and the other is moving. Therefore, using the velocity addition formula, each would say the other has that speed as calculated. Therefore, since both are moving in the same direction, it\'s crucial to use the correct formula. So, yes, in the frame S which is stationary with respect to, say, Earth, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c. To find the speed of A as seen from B\'s frame, we need to apply the velocity transformation. Here, relative velocity addresses the velocity of A from B\'s frame.\n\nIn which case, the answer is 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) ≈ 0.1428c. So, approximately 1/7th c. Hmm, 1/7 is around 0.1428. So that\'s about (1/7)c. If proper, convert it exactly:\n\n0.1 / 0.7 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. So, exact value would be c/7 ≈ 0.1428c.\n\nTherefore, the relative speed is c/7 or approximately 0.1428c.\n\nAlright, that\'s the relative speed sorted.\n\nNow, regarding the total energy of the system. Each astronaut\'s total energy in the system’s frame (that is, in the original frame where both are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively). Wait, total energy is frame-dependent. The problem says "the total energy of the system," but does it specify which frame? Since the problem states both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction, but there is no mention of a particular reference frame. Hmm. Unless implicit that it\'s the energy in the Earth\'s frame or some lab frame where their velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c. Otherwise, total energy is not an invariant; it changes if observed from another frame. So, the problem might just want the total energy in the original frame where their velocities are given. Probably yes, so in that case, we can compute each astronaut\'s relativistic energy and sum them up.\n\nTotal Energy = γ₁m₁c² + γ₂m₂c².\n\nWhere γ (Lorentz factor) is 1/√(1 - v²/c²).\n\nGiven:\n\nFor astronaut 1: m = 2m, speed 0.6c.\n\nFor astronaut 2: m = 3m, speed 0.5c.\n\nHold on, actually, the mass stated as 2m and 3m may be the rest masses, not relativistic masses. Yes, in relativity, unless specified otherwise, mass refers to rest mass. So, each astronaut\'s rest mass is given, and we have to calculate their total energy in the given frame.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFor astronaut 1: Total energy E₁ = γ₁m₁c².\n\nm₁ = 2m\n\nv₁ = 0.6c\n\nCalculate γ₁: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.\n\nThus, E₁ = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².\n\nFor astronaut 2: m₂ = 3m\n\nv₂ = 0.5c\n\nγ₂: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.\n\nTherefore, E₂ ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².\n\nTherefore, total energy E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ (2.5 + 3.4641) m c² ≈ 5.9641 m c².\n\nAlternatively, exact values:\n\nE₂ = 3m c² / sqrt(0.75) = 3m c² / (√(3)/2) = 3m c² * 2/√3 = 6 / √3 m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².\n\nThus, E_total is 5.9641 m c², which I can write as approximately 5.96 m c², but maybe to be precise, exactly 2.5 + (6/√3) = 2.5 + 2*(√3)/ (√3 / √3): Wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, √3 is approximately 1.732, so 6 / √3 ≈ 3.464 as I had. So then, addition of 2.5 and 3.464 gives total E approx 5.964 m c². So, depending on the desired precision, maybe asked exactly.\n\nAlternatively, can express 6 / sqrt(3) in terms of sqrt(3): Well, 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3).\n\nSince sqrt(3)*sqrt(3) is 3, so 6 divided by sqrt(3) is 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3). Yes, because 6 divided by sqrt(3) can be rewritten as (6 sqrt(3)) / 3 = 2 sqrt(3). So, E₂ is 2 sqrt(3) m c². Wait, hold on:\n\nWait first:\n\nIf I consider 3m c² divided by sqrt(3/4) (since if v^2 / c^2 is 0.25, so 1 – 0.25 = 0.75; sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, gamma = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore, E = gamma * m c² = (2 / sqrt(3)) * 3m c² = (6 / sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c².\n\nWait, since 6 / sqrt(3) is equal to 6 sqrt(3)/3 = 2 sqrt(3). So E₂ = 2 sqrt(3) m , so sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 2 * 1.732 ≈ 3.464.\n\nHence E_total = 2.5 m c² + 2 sqrt(3) m c² = (2.5 + 3.464) m c² ≈ 5.964 m c².\n\nTherefore, if we need an exact value, E_total = [5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)] m c². Alternatively, 5/2 is 2.5, so sum is 2.5 + 2 sqrt(3) ≈ 5.964. Not sure if needed in a specific form, but maybe just give compute it as a numerical factor. Alternatively, if both gamma factors are to be exact.\n\nAlternatively, also, for Astronaut 1: γ = 1.25 = 5/4, so E1 = (5/4)*2m c² = (5/2)m c². Astronaut 2: γ = 1/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2/sqrt(3), therefore E2 = (2/sqrt(3)) * 3m c² = (6/sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c², so total E is (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) m c² ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 =5.964 m c². Therefore, that’s the exact expression. Alternatively, rationalize.\n\nAlternatively, write: To express this combined over a common denominator, but perhaps 5/2 equals 2.5, and 2√3 ≈ 3.464, so altogether E ≈ 5.964 m c²= ~~6 m c². But not entirely. Alternatively, let\'s check the sum again:\n\n5/2 = 2.5\n\n2*sqrt(3) ≈ 3.464101615\n\nSum: 2.5 + 3.464101615 ≈ 5.964101615 m c²≈≈ 5.96 m c².\n\nHence total Energy≈5.96 m c².\n\nWait. So the problem said "the total energy of the system". It\'s possible that in the center-of-momentum frame, but the question\'s wording is unclear, but likely, given that both speeds are given in the same direction (positive x-direction), the total energy is in the original frame where these velocities are measured, which is probably the Earth frame.\n\nAlternatively, But unless mentioned otherwise, authors likely expect total energy in the Earth frame.\n\nTherefore, assuming the initial frame (let’s say Earth frame), where astronaut 1 (2m) moves at 0.6c, astronaut 2 (3m) moves at 0.5c, then calculate total energy.\n\nTherefore calculated E_total = γ₁ m₁ c² + γ₂ m₂ c² = 2.5 m c² + 2*sqrt(3)m c²≈5.96 m c².\n\nTherefore expressing answers:\n\nRelative speed is (0.1c)/0.7≈c/7≈0.1428c.\n\nTotal energy≈(5.96)m c².\n\nI should verify if units need to be considered, but since m is given as mass, probably in kg (with some multiplier if necessary), but the problem states "put your final answer in..." but likely the answer requires symbolic expressions with m and c.\n\nHence, the total energy would be expressed exactly as (5/2 + 2*sqrt(3))mc². Alternatively (5/2 + 2√3) mc². Alternatively, perhaps to rationalize in terms of simplification?\n\nExpressed as (5/2 + 2√3 ) mc² = ?\n\n5/2 is 2.5, 2√3≈3.464. Hence, as per exact terms, the answer is that. Alternatively, E_total= [2.5 + 3.464] mc² which is 5.964 mc², but for correctness, in symbolic notation, need to use sqrt(3), not approximate. Hence, the precise answer is (5/2 + 2√3) mc².\n\nNow, let me confirm astronomy conventions. In total energy, assuming that in the same frame, summing energies: yes. If masses are rest masses, which they are.

Wait 0.1 / 0.7 is 1/7. So (0.1 divided by 0.7) = 1/7 = approx 0.1428c. So exact answer relative speed is c/7.

To find the relative speed of the two astronauts, we use Einstein's velocity addition formula. The velocities of the astronauts are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The formula for relative speed when both are moving in the same direction is:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\):

\[
u' = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{c}{7}
\]

Thus, the relative speed is \(\boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}}\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system in the lab frame (where the velocities are given). The total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 2\sqrt{3} \cdot m \cdot c^2
\]

Summing the energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 2\sqrt{3}m c^2 = \left( \frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is \(\boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}\).

 Hmmm. Wait, the relative speed as a scalar should perhaps be the same. But technically, the relative velocity would have direction. The problem uses "relative speed," so the magnitude, which in this case would be (0.6c -0.5c)/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c regardless of frame? Wait no, that’s in the frame of the slower astronaut. The problem might be ambiguous if not clarified. Hmm.

Wait, but in relative speed calculations, in special relativity, relative speed isn’t simply the difference. Instead, each observer measures the other’s speed according to their own frame. Thus, from the perspective of each astronaut, they're at rest, and the other is moving. Therefore, using the velocity addition formula, each would say the other has that speed as calculated. Therefore, since both are moving in the same direction, it's crucial to use the correct formula. So, yes, in the frame S which is stationary with respect to, say, Earth, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c. To find the speed of A as seen from B's frame, we need to apply the velocity transformation. Here, relative velocity addresses the velocity of A from B's frame.

In which case, the answer is 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) ≈ 0.1428c. So, approximately 1/7th c. Hmm, 1/7 is around 0.1428. So that's about (1/7)c. If proper, convert it exactly:

0.1 / 0.7 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1428. So, exact value would be c/7 ≈ 0.1428c.

Therefore, the relative speed is c/7 or approximately 0.1428c.

Alright, that's the relative speed sorted.

Now, regarding the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's total energy in the system’s frame (that is, in the original frame where both are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively). Wait, total energy is frame-dependent. The problem says "the total energy of the system," but does it specify which frame? Since the problem states both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction, but there is no mention of a particular reference frame. Hmm. Unless implicit that it's the energy in the Earth's frame or some lab frame where their velocities are 0.6c and 0.5c. Otherwise, total energy is not an invariant; it changes if observed from another frame. So, the problem might just want the total energy in the original frame where their velocities are given. Probably yes, so in that case, we can compute each astronaut's relativistic energy and sum them up.

Total Energy = γ₁m₁c² + γ₂m₂c².

Where γ (Lorentz factor) is 1/√(1 - v²/c²).

Given:

For astronaut 1: m = 2m, speed 0.6c.

For astronaut 2: m = 3m, speed 0.5c.

Hold on, actually, the mass stated as 2m and 3m may be the rest masses, not relativistic masses. Yes, in relativity, unless specified otherwise, mass refers to rest mass. So, each astronaut's rest mass is given, and we have to calculate their total energy in the given frame.

Therefore:

For astronaut 1: Total energy E₁ = γ₁m₁c².

m₁ = 2m

v₁ = 0.6c

Calculate γ₁: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

Thus, E₁ = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2: m₂ = 3m

v₂ = 0.5c

γ₂: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Therefore, E₂ ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Therefore, total energy E_total = E₁ + E₂ ≈ (2.5 + 3.4641) m c² ≈ 5.9641 m c².

Alternatively, exact values:

E₂ = 3m c² / sqrt(0.75) = 3m c² / (√(3)/2) = 3m c² * 2/√3 = 6 / √3 m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Thus, E_total is 5.9641 m c², which I can write as approximately 5.96 m c², but maybe to be precise, exactly 2.5 + (6/√3) = 2.5 + 2*(√3)/ (√3 / √3): Wait, no.

Wait, actually, √3 is approximately 1.732, so 6 / √3 ≈ 3.464 as I had. So then, addition of 2.5 and 3.464 gives total E approx 5.964 m c². So, depending on the desired precision, maybe asked exactly.

Alternatively, can express 6 / sqrt(3) in terms of sqrt(3): Well, 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3).

Since sqrt(3)*sqrt(3) is 3, so 6 divided by sqrt(3) is 6 / sqrt(3) = 2 sqrt(3). Yes, because 6 divided by sqrt(3) can be rewritten as (6 sqrt(3)) / 3 = 2 sqrt(3). So, E₂ is 2 sqrt(3) m c². Wait, hold on:

Wait first:

If I consider 3m c² divided by sqrt(3/4) (since if v^2 / c^2 is 0.25, so 1 – 0.25 = 0.75; sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, gamma = 1 / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 / sqrt(3).

Therefore, E = gamma * m c² = (2 / sqrt(3)) * 3m c² = (6 / sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c².

Wait, since 6 / sqrt(3) is equal to 6 sqrt(3)/3 = 2 sqrt(3). So E₂ = 2 sqrt(3) m , so sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 2 * 1.732 ≈ 3.464.

Hence E_total = 2.5 m c² + 2 sqrt(3) m c² = (2.5 + 3.464) m c² ≈ 5.964 m c².

Therefore, if we need an exact value, E_total = [5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)] m c². Alternatively, 5/2 is 2.5, so sum is 2.5 + 2 sqrt(3) ≈ 5.964. Not sure if needed in a specific form, but maybe just give compute it as a numerical factor. Alternatively, if both gamma factors are to be exact.

Alternatively, also, for Astronaut 1: γ = 1.25 = 5/4, so E1 = (5/4)*2m c² = (5/2)m c². Astronaut 2: γ = 1/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2/sqrt(3), therefore E2 = (2/sqrt(3)) * 3m c² = (6/sqrt(3)) m c² = 2 sqrt(3) m c², so total E is (5/2 + 2 sqrt(3)) m c² ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 =5.964 m c². Therefore, that’s the exact expression. Alternatively, rationalize.

Alternatively, write: To express this combined over a common denominator, but perhaps 5/2 equals 2.5, and 2√3 ≈ 3.464, so altogether E ≈ 5.964 m c²= ~~6 m c². But not entirely. Alternatively, let's check the sum again:

5/2 = 2.5

2*sqrt(3) ≈ 3.464101615

Sum: 2.5 + 3.464101615 ≈ 5.964101615 m c²≈≈ 5.96 m c².

Hence total Energy≈5.96 m c².

Wait. So the problem said "the total energy of the system". It's possible that in the center-of-momentum frame, but the question's wording is unclear, but likely, given that both speeds are given in the same direction (positive x-direction), the total energy is in the original frame where these velocities are measured, which is probably the Earth frame.

Alternatively, But unless mentioned otherwise, authors likely expect total energy in the Earth frame.

Therefore, assuming the initial frame (let’s say Earth frame), where astronaut 1 (2m) moves at 0.6c, astronaut 2 (3m) moves at 0.5c, then calculate total energy.

Therefore calculated E_total = γ₁ m₁ c² + γ₂ m₂ c² = 2.5 m c² + 2*sqrt(3)m c²≈5.96 m c².

Therefore expressing answers:

Relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7≈c/7≈0.1428c.

Total energy≈(5.96)m c².

I should verify if units need to be considered, but since m is given as mass, probably in kg (with some multiplier if necessary), but the problem states "put your final answer in..." but likely the answer requires symbolic expressions with m and c.

Hence, the total energy would be expressed exactly as (5/2 + 2*sqrt(3))mc². Alternatively (5/2 + 2√3) mc². Alternatively, perhaps to rationalize in terms of simplification?

Expressed as (5/2 + 2√3 ) mc² = ?

5/2 is 2.5, 2√3≈3.464. Hence, as per exact terms, the answer is that. Alternatively, E_total= [2.5 + 3.464] mc² which is 5.964 mc², but for correctness, in symbolic notation, need to use sqrt(3), not approximate. Hence, the precise answer is (5/2 + 2√3) mc².

Now, let me confirm astronomy conventions. In total energy, assuming that in the same frame, summing energies: yes. If masses are rest masses, which they are. The problem says masses 2m and 3m, which physically in relativity are rest masses (invariant masses), so agreement there.

Thus. to wrap this up,

Relative speed: (1/7)c

Alternatively, with the exact fraction be? Wait 0.1 / 0.7 is 1/7. So (0.1 divided by 0.7) = 1/7 = approx 0.1428c. So exact answer relative speed is c/7. But wait, the actual calculation: (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²), with u = 0.6c, v = 0.5c:

(u - v) = 0.1c

1 - uv/c² =1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²=1 - 0.3=0.7

Thus 0.1c /0.7 = (1/10)c/(7/10)= (1/7)c. Hence exact value is c/7. Cool! Therefore, relative speed is c/7.

So, that exact answer is preferable. The speed is addition is exact c/7.

Total energy is combining E₁=5/2*mc² (from 1.25*2m c²) and E₂=2√3*mc² (from 3m*gamma(0.5c)*c²)≈3.464, but combined with gamma calculated as (exact):

Since for Astronaut 2: v=0.5c, so gamma is exactly 2/sqrt(3), then E₂=3m c²*(2/sqrt(3)) m c²= (6/sqrt(3))m c²=2*sqrt(3)m c². Hence, E_total=(5/2 + 2*sqrt(3))m c².

Therefore, written as ((5/2) + 2√3) m c². If you need a single fraction, 5/2 is 2.5, but not essential. Hence, this is the exact value. If we convert that to multiples:

Express as:

Total energy:

E = (5/(2) + 2√3) m c² = m c² (5/(2) + 2√3 )

If needed decimal approximated, about 5.96 mc². But as per the problem, it's better to check if they prefer symbolic or numeric. The question didn't specify, so in logical conclusion, exact in terms of fractions and radicals, and c/7.

Thus final summaries:

Relative speed: c/7

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3) m c²

Alternatively, but maybe to write it even more combined.

Let me check:

(5/2 + 2√3 ) = (5 + 4√3 )/2.

Wait:

5/2 + 2sqrt(3) is equivalent to (5 + 4sqrt(3))/2.

Alternatively, 2sqrt(3)= 4sqrt(3)/2, so 5/2 + 4sqrt(3)/2 = (5 +4sqrt(3))/2.

Hence, total energy:
E = \frac{5 + 4\sqrt{3}}{2} m c^2

Alternatively, same thing. Might prefer one expression or the other. Maybe (5 + 4√3)/2 multiplied by mc².

Let me compute the parentheses:

5 + 4*1.732 ≈5 + 6.928≈11.928 /2≈5.964, which matches our prior decimal approximation.

Alternatively:

To verify:

(5 +4√3)/2

4√3≈6.9282, 5 + 6.9282=11.9282, divide by 2=5.9641≈5.964. Hence same result. Therefore either form is acceptable, but if need to give in exact terms, most factored form is (5/2 + 2√3)m c², which may be more readable.

Hence, conclusion:

Relative speed: c/7.

Total energy: (5/2 + 2√3)m c².

Hence, boxed.

Heh, spaced these at the beginning; time to recap.

Problem requires relative speed and total energy.

Check if relativistic speeds force us to use Lorentz transformations. They do. Regular Galilean addition is invalid. Hence correct relative speed is found via relativisti velocity addition formula:

(u - v)/(1 - uv/c²)= (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 -0.6*0.5)=0.1c/(0.7)=c/7≈0.1428c.

In total energy:

Each astronaut's energy in Earth frame: each m rest mass, multiplied by their own Lorentz factors. Sum energies.

Computations showed E1= (5/2)m c², E2=2√3 m c². Thus total energy (5/2 +2√3)m c².

Hence,

Final answers written as: for speed: \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and for total energy: \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}

Maybe to check if there was the other way around, but done.

Other check, would the total energy be adding in another frame? But the problem seems to not specify. For instance, is total energy expected in the center of momentum frame? If that's the case, the calculation would be different, and long. But the problem clearly says "two astronauts of masses 2m and 3m travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c... What will be... the total energy of the system".

Since the velocities are given in a presumed inertial frame (Earth/lab frame), the problem likely expects you to answer the total energy in that frame. Hence it's the sum of their relativistic energies in that frame. A thorough answer.

Thus exactly as calculated. Confirming. Yep.

**Final Answer**
The relative speed is \boxed{\dfrac{c}{7}} and the total energy of the system is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3} \right) mc^2}.
