# Original Question

Imagine an operator $\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0, \hbar/\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\hbar/\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \hbar/\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \hbar/\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \hbar/\sqrt{2},0)$. Similarly, matrix form of the  operator $P_z$ has components in the first row as $(\hbar, 0, 0)$, that in the second row as $(0, 0, 0)$ and that in the third row as $(0,0, -\hbar)$. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The system is found in the eigenstate of $P_x$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $-\hbar$. To be more specific, the explicit form of the state of the system is given by the column vector having elements $(-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. What is the uncertainty $\Delta P_z $ of $P_z$

To find the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) of \(P_z\) for the given state, we need to compute the expectation values \(\langle P_z \rangle\) and \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\) and then use the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}
\]

The state vector is given as \(\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}\), which is normalized since the sum of the squares of the components is 1. The matrix for \(P_z\) is diagonal with eigenvalues \(\hbar\), 0, and \(-\hbar\).

1. **Calculating \(\langle P_z \rangle\):**
   \[
   \langle P_z \rangle = \left( \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \cdot \hbar \right) + \left( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 \cdot 0 \right) + \left( \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \cdot (-\hbar) \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the terms:
   \[
   \langle P_z \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{4} \hbar \right) + 0 + \left( -\frac{1}{4} \hbar \right) = 0
   \]

2. **Calculating \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\):**
   The matrix for \(P_z^2\) is diagonal with eigenvalues \(\hbar^2\), 0, and \(\hbar^2\).
   \[
   \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left( \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 \right) + \left( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 \cdot 0 \right) + \left( \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying the terms:
   \[
   \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \right) + 0 + \left( \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2
   \]

3. **Calculating the uncertainty:**
   \[
   \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).

Okay, so I have to find the uncertainty ΔP_z for the operator P_z when the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. Let me recall that the uncertainty is defined as the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. In symbols, ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). 

First, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that should simplify things because the matrix for P_z is diagonal. Let me confirm the matrices given.

The matrix for P_z is:

First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)

So indeed, it's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal. That makes sense because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so each basis vector corresponds to a state with a definite P_z value. The eigenvalues here are ħ, 0, -ħ. Therefore, the first basis vector |1⟩ has P_z = ħ, the second |2⟩ has P_z = 0, and the third |3⟩ has P_z = -ħ.

But our state vector is given as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me note that in standard quantum mechanics, state vectors are represented as column vectors, and operators as matrices. To compute expectation values, I need to take the conjugate transpose of the state (the bra vector), multiply by the operator matrix (in this case P_z or P_z²), and then multiply by the state (ket vector).

But since P_z is diagonal, maybe there's a shortcut. Also, the state vector isn't normalized. Wait, is that right? Let's check its norm. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components. The components here are real numbers, so we can just square them:

(-1/2)² + (1/√2)² + (-1/2)² = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So the state vector is already normalized. That's good.

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, we can think of it as the sum over the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities. Each component's probability is the square of the amplitude. For example, the first component is -1/2, corresponding to the eigenvalue ħ, so probability |c1|² = (1/2)² = 1/4. The second component is 1/√2, which corresponds to eigenvalue 0, probability |c2|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2. Third component is -1/2, corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ, probability |c3|² = (1/2)² = 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ would be (1/4)ħ + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0. Got it.

Next, ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared would have eigenvalues ħ², 0, and ħ² for the corresponding eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ. So P_z² is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries (ħ², 0, ħ²).

Alternatively, squaring the eigenvalues, since if they are diagonal matrices. Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ would be (1/4)ħ² + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ².

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = √( (1/2)ħ² - 0 ) = √(1/2)ħ = (1/√2)ħ.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me confirm by actual matrix multiplication instead of using eigenvalues and probabilities.

The state vector is:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
       [ 1/√2 ]
       [ -1/2 ]

Calculating ⟨P_z⟩: ψ† P_z ψ. 

But since P_z is diagonal, we can just take each component's coefficient multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue and then multiply with the complex conjugate. But since the coefficients are real here, so it's just each component squared times eigenvalue.

So that brings us back to the same calculation. So ⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 * ħ ) + ( (1/√2)^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ) ).
Which is (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ) = 0.

Then ⟨P_z²⟩ is ( (-1/2)^2 * ħ² ) + ( (1/√2)^2 * 0 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 * ħ² )
= (1/4 ħ²) + 0 + (1/4 ħ²) = 1/2 ħ². Same as before.

Thus the uncertainty is √(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / √2. So that's ΔP_z. 

But wait, is there a different approach? Let's check once again.

Multiply P_z with the state vector. So P_z ψ = [ ħ*(-1/2), 0* (1/√2), -ħ*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T. Then the expectation value is ψ† (P_z ψ). Let's compute that:

psi is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ], so the conjugate transpose (which is same as transpose here since components are real) is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Multiplying this with P_z ψ, which is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T:

(-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2) = ( ħ/4 ) + 0 + ( -ħ/4 ) = 0. Confirming ⟨P_z⟩=0.

Similarly, for ⟨P_z²⟩, compute P_z squared ψ. But since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the diagonal matrix with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

Thus, acting on ψ:

[ ħ²*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), ħ²*(-1/2) ] ?

Wait no. No, actually, if P_z² is a diagonal matrix with (ħ², 0, ħ²) on the diagonal, then acting on ψ, you multiply each component of ψ by the diagonal entry.

Alternatively, since P_z² = (P_z)^2, so operators applied twice. But since the original P_z for the basis states just pick up the eigenvalue each time, so applying P_z twice is equivalent to squaring the eigenvalue.

Therefore, the outcome of P_z² ψ would be [ (ħ)^2*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), (-ħ)^2*(-1/2) ] = [ ħ²*(-1/2), 0, ħ²*(-1/2) ].

Wait, no. Wait. The operation is P_z squared as a matrix multiplication. Let me do that.

Given a diagonal matrix with entries (ħ², 0, ħ²), then multiplying with ψ:

First component: (ħ²)(-1/2)
Second component: 0*(1/√2) = 0
Third component: ħ²*(-1/2)

So P_z² ψ = [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T

Then ⟨P_z²⟩ = ψ† (P_z² ψ ) = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] * [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T

= (-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2)

= ( ħ²/4 ) + 0 + ( ħ²/4 ) = ħ²/2, same as before.

Therefore, uncertainty is sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0) = ħ/sqrt(2). 

Alright, so everything checks out. Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is ħ divided by the square root of 2.

**Final Answer**
The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).

I need to determine the uncertainty ΔP_z for the P_z operator when the system exists in a particular eigenstate of P_x. The uncertainty is calculated as ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²), which is the square root of the difference between the expectation value of P_z squared and the squared expectation value of P_z.

To begin, I'll need to calculate both ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. The state vector is presented as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Since we're working with basis vectors that are eigenvectors of P_z, the calculations should be straightforward because the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal.

Let me verify the given matrix for P_z:

Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0) 
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

This confirms that P_z is indeed diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ along the diagonal. This makes sense because the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, with each basis vector representing a state with a definite P_z value. Specifically, the first basis vector |1⟩ corresponds to P_z = ħ, the second basis vector |2⟩ corresponds to P_z = 0, and the third basis vector |3⟩ corresponds to P_z = -ħ.

Our state vector is represented as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). In quantum mechanics, state vectors are typically represented as column vectors and operators as matrices. To calculate expectation values, I need to take the conjugate transpose of the state vector (creating a bra vector), multiply it by the operator matrix (in this case P_z or P

# OpenAI completion

To determine the uncertainty ΔP_z for the operator P_z when the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x, it's important to remember that the uncertainty is defined as the square root of the difference between the expectation value of P_z squared and the square of the expectation value of P_z. Symbolically, this is represented as ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

The first step is to calculate ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. The state vector is given as a column vector with the elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, this simplifies the problem because the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal. Let's confirm the matrices provided.

The matrix representation of P_z is:

Row one: (ħ, 0, 0)  
Row two: (0, 0, 0)  
Row three: (0, 0, -ħ)  

Indeed, it's a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements ħ, 0, -ħ, which is logical because the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. Thus, each basis vector corresponds to a state with a specific P_z value. The eigenvalues here are ħ, 0, -ħ. Consequently, the first basis vector |1⟩ corresponds to P_z = ħ, the second basis vector |2⟩ corresponds to P_z = 0, and the third basis vector |3⟩ corresponds to P_z = -ħ.

However, the given state vector is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). In conventional quantum mechanics, state vectors are expressed as column vectors, and operators as matrices. To find the expectation values, it's necessary to take the conjugate transpose of the state vector (bra vector), then multiply it by the operator matrix (either P_z or P_z²) and subsequently by the state vector again.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ and ⟨P_z²⟩ = ψ† P_z² ψ.\n\nGiven the state vector ψ = [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ]^T, the conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ] assuming all components are real, which they seem to be here. Let me check if there are any complex components. Looking at the state vector given, all entries are real numbers, so ψ† is just the transpose, which is a row vector with the same entries. \n\nSo, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to multiply ψ† by P_z matrix and then by ψ. Let\'s first compute ⟨P_z⟩. \n\nThe P_z matrix is:\n\n[ ħ   0    0  ]\n[ 0   0    0  ]\n[ 0   0  -ħ ]\n\nSo when I multiply the row vector [ -1/2  1/√2  -1/2 ] by this matrix, the result will be:\n\nFirst component: (-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0 = -ħ/2\n\nSecond component: (-1/2)*0 + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0 = 0\n\nThird component: (-1/2)*0 + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ) = ħ/2\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn\'t seem right. Wait, no, matrix multiplication with a row vector on the left (bra) is just each component of the resulting vector being the sum of the products of the row vector components with the respective column components of the matrix. So, let me correct that.\n\nActually, for ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ, you perform ψ† multiplied by (P_z ψ). Let me compute P_z ψ first.\n\nP_z acting on ψ: first, write ψ as a column vector:\n\nψ = [ -1/2 ]\n      [ 1/√2 ]\n      [ -1/2 ]\n\nMultiplying P_z (which is diagonal) by ψ:\n\nFirst element: ħ * (-1/2) = -ħ/2\n\nSecond element: 0 * (1/√2) = 0\n\nThird element: (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ħ/2\n\nSo P_z ψ is the column vector [ -ħ/2 , 0 , ħ/2 ]^T.\n\nThen, ψ† is [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ].\n\nSo ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† (P_z ψ) = (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2)\n\nLet\'s compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2)(-ħ/2) = (1/4)ħ\n\nSecond term: (1/√2)(0) = 0\n\nThird term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = (-1/4)ħ\n\nSo adding them up: (1/4)ħ + 0 - (1/4)ħ = 0\n\nOh, okay, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That simplifies things a bit. Now we need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, and the uncertainty will just be the square root of that because the square of the expectation value is zero.\n\nSo let\'s compute P_z squared. Since P_z is diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ, squaring the matrix would square each diagonal element:\n\nP_z² = \n\n[ ħ²   0     0   ]\n[ 0    0     0   ]\n[ 0    0    ħ² ]\n\nSo now we need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ = ψ† P_z² ψ.\n\nFirst, compute P_z² acting on ψ. Since P_z² is diagonal with entries ħ², 0, ħ². Wait, hold on: actually, the third diagonal entry is (-ħ)^2 = ħ² as well, so indeed, P_z² is:\n\n[ ħ²   0     0   ]\n[ 0    0     0   ]\n[ 0    0    ħ² ]\n\nSo multiplying P_z² by ψ:\n\nFirst element: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2\n\nSecond element: 0 * 1/√2 = 0\n\nThird element: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2\n\nWait, so P_z² ψ is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.\n\nThen, ψ† P_z² ψ is [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ] multiplied by [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.\n\nLet\'s compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) = (1/4)ħ²\n\nSecond term: (1/√2)*0 = 0\n\nThird term: (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) = (1/4)ħ²\n\nAdding them up: (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ².\n\nTherefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2)ħ². Since the expectation value of P_z is zero, the uncertainty is:\n\nΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = √((1/2)ħ² - 0) = √(1/2) ħ = (ħ)/√2.\n\nBut wait, √(1/2) is 1/√2, so √(1/2) ħ is ħ / √2. Let me confirm the calculation of ⟨P_z²⟩.\n\nWait, when I computed P_z² ψ, is it correct?\n\nWait, no. Wait, P_z² is:\n\n[ ħ², 0, 0\n\n0, 0, 0\n\n0, 0, ħ² ]\n\nSo multiplying by ψ:\n\nFirst component: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2\n\nSecond component: 0\n\nThird component: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2\n\nThus, P_z² ψ is the vector [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T, which when you take the dot product with ψ† (which is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]) gives:\n\n(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2) = (ħ²/4) + 0 + (ħ²/4) = ħ²/2. Yes, that\'s correct. So ⟨P_z²⟩ is indeed (1/2)ħ². \n\nTherefore, uncertainty ΔP_z is √( (1/2)ħ² ) which is ħ / √2. \n\nWait, but √( (1/2)ħ² ) is sqrt(1/2)*ħ = ħ / sqrt(2) which can also be written as ħ√2 / 2. Either form is correct. They want the answer in terms of ħ, so probably either is okay, but maybe they prefer a rationalized denominator? In this case, sqrt(2) in the denominator. But the problem says "put your final answer within \\boxed{}", so maybe it\'s written in terms of \\hbar. So the uncertainty is ħ divided by √2. \n\nWait, but wait a second. The state is given as an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The components of the state being (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me check whether this state is correctly normalized. To confirm normalization, the sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1. Let\'s check:\n\n(-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) + 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So yes, it\'s normalized. That checks out.\n\nAnother way to check for errors: the given state should be the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Let me verify quickly if multiplying the P_x matrix by the state gives -ħ times the state. Maybe not necessary for the problem, but just to ensure that the state is correctly given.\n\nThe matrix for P_x is:\n\nFirst row: 0, ħ/√2, 0\n\nSecond row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2\n\nThird row: 0, ħ/√2, 0\n\nLet me compute P_x multiplied by ψ:\n\nFirst component: 0*(-1/2) + (ħ/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = (ħ/√2)(1/√2) = ħ/2\n\nSecond component: (ħ/√2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (ħ/√2)*(-1/2) = (-ħ)/(2√2) + 0 + (-ħ)/(2√2) = (-ħ)/(√2)\n\nThird component: 0*(-1/2) + (ħ/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = (ħ/√2)(1/√2) = ħ/2\n\nSo the result of P_x ψ is [ ħ/2 , -ħ/√2 , ħ/2 ]^T. \n\nCompare this to -ħ times the original state: -ħ * [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T = [ ħ/2 , -ħ/√2, ħ/2 ]^T. Which is exactly P_x ψ. Therefore, indeed, this state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. So everything checks out here, so the given state is correct.\n\nTherefore, my calculation of ΔP_z is correct. It\'s ħ / √2. I can write this as (ℏ / √2) assuming ħ is h-bar.\n\nLet me just make sure that in the question, is it ħ or ℏ? The original problem statement uses \\hbar in the matrices, which is standard. So the answer is ℏ divided by sqrt(2), which can be written as ℏ/sqrt{2} or ℏ√2/2, but since sqrt(2) is irrational, maybe it\'s better to have rational denominator? Hmmm, not sure. But in quantum mechanics, it\'s pretty standard to see uncertainties expressed as ℏ over sqrt(2). So I think that\'s acceptable.\n\nHence, the uncertainty ΔP_z is ℏ divided by the square root of 2. So the final answer is ℏ/√2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}}$.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743848628, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3224, prompt_tokens=718, total_tokens=3942, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) of the operator \(P_z\) for the given eigenstate of \(P_x\), we need to compute the expectation values \(\langle P_z \rangle\) and \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\). The state vector is given as \(\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}\).

1. **Expectation Value \(\langle P_z \rangle\)**:
   - The matrix form of \(P_z\) is:
     \[
     P_z = \begin{pmatrix} 
     \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 
     0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
     0 & 0 & -\hbar 
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Compute \(P_z \psi\):
     \[
     P_z \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 
     \hbar \cdot (-1/2) \\ 
     0 \cdot 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 
     -\hbar \cdot (-1/2) 
     \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\hbar/2 \\ 0 \\ \hbar/2 \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Calculate \(\langle P_z \rangle\) by multiplying \(\psi^\dagger\) with \(P_z \psi\):
     \[
     \langle P_z \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\hbar/2 \\ 0 \\ \hbar/2 \end{pmatrix} = (-1/2)(-\hbar/2) + 0 + (-1/2)(\hbar/2) = 0
     \]

2. **Expectation Value \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\)**:
   - The matrix form of \(P_z^2\) is:
     \[
     P_z^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 
     \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 
     0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
     0 & 0 & \hbar^2 
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Compute \(P_z^2 \psi\):
     \[
     P_z^2 \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 
     \hbar^2 \cdot (-1/2) \\ 
     0 \cdot 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 
     \hbar^2 \cdot (-1/2) 
     \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\hbar^2/2 \\ 0 \\ -\hbar^2/2 \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Calculate \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\) by multiplying \(\psi^\dagger\) with \(P_z^2 \psi\):
     \[
     \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & 1/\sqrt{2} & -1/2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\hbar^2/2 \\ 0 \\ -\hbar^2/2 \end{pmatrix} = (-1/2)(-\hbar^2/2) + 0 + (-1/2)(-\hbar^2/2) = \hbar^2/2
     \]

3. **Uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\)**:
   - Using the formula for uncertainty:
     \[
     \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]

The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).

_z squared), and then multiply by the original state (the ket vector). So, ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ and ⟨P_z²⟩ = ψ† P_z² ψ.

Given the state vector ψ = [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ]^T, the conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ] assuming all components are real, which they seem to be here. Let me check if there are any complex components. Looking at the state vector given, all entries are real numbers, so ψ† is just the transpose, which is a row vector with the same entries. 

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to multiply ψ† by P_z matrix and then by ψ. Let's first compute ⟨P_z⟩. 

The P_z matrix is:

[ ħ   0    0  ]
[ 0   0    0  ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So when I multiply the row vector [ -1/2  1/√2  -1/2 ] by this matrix, the result will be:

First component: (-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0 = -ħ/2

Second component: (-1/2)*0 + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0 = 0

Third component: (-1/2)*0 + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ) = ħ/2

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, matrix multiplication with a row vector on the left (bra) is just each component of the resulting vector being the sum of the products of the row vector components with the respective column components of the matrix. So, let me correct that.

Actually, for ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ, you perform ψ† multiplied by (P_z ψ). Let me compute P_z ψ first.

P_z acting on ψ: first, write ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
      [ 1/√2 ]
      [ -1/2 ]

Multiplying P_z (which is diagonal) by ψ:

First element: ħ * (-1/2) = -ħ/2

Second element: 0 * (1/√2) = 0

Third element: (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z ψ is the column vector [ -ħ/2 , 0 , ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, ψ† is [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ].

So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† (P_z ψ) = (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2)

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-1/2)(-ħ/2) = (1/4)ħ

Second term: (1/√2)(0) = 0

Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = (-1/4)ħ

So adding them up: (1/4)ħ + 0 - (1/4)ħ = 0

Oh, okay, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That simplifies things a bit. Now we need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, and the uncertainty will just be the square root of that because the square of the expectation value is zero.

So let's compute P_z squared. Since P_z is diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ, squaring the matrix would square each diagonal element:

P_z² = 

[ ħ²   0     0   ]
[ 0    0     0   ]
[ 0    0    ħ² ]

So now we need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ = ψ† P_z² ψ.

First, compute P_z² acting on ψ. Since P_z² is diagonal with entries ħ², 0, ħ². Wait, hold on: actually, the third diagonal entry is (-ħ)^2 = ħ² as well, so indeed, P_z² is:

[ ħ²   0     0   ]
[ 0    0     0   ]
[ 0    0    ħ² ]

So multiplying P_z² by ψ:

First element: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2

Second element: 0 * 1/√2 = 0

Third element: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2

Wait, so P_z² ψ is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Then, ψ† P_z² ψ is [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ] multiplied by [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) = (1/4)ħ²

Second term: (1/√2)*0 = 0

Third term: (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) = (1/4)ħ²

Adding them up: (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ².

Therefore, ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2)ħ². Since the expectation value of P_z is zero, the uncertainty is:

ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = √((1/2)ħ² - 0) = √(1/2) ħ = (ħ)/√2.

But wait, √(1/2) is 1/√2, so √(1/2) ħ is ħ / √2. Let me confirm the calculation of ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, when I computed P_z² ψ, is it correct?

Wait, no. Wait, P_z² is:

[ ħ², 0, 0

0, 0, 0

0, 0, ħ² ]

So multiplying by ψ:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2

Second component: 0

Third component: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2

Thus, P_z² ψ is the vector [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T, which when you take the dot product with ψ† (which is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]) gives:

(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2) = (ħ²/4) + 0 + (ħ²/4) = ħ²/2. Yes, that's correct. So ⟨P_z²⟩ is indeed (1/2)ħ². 

Therefore, uncertainty ΔP_z is √( (1/2)ħ² ) which is ħ / √2. 

Wait, but √( (1/2)ħ² ) is sqrt(1/2)*ħ = ħ / sqrt(2) which can also be written as ħ√2 / 2. Either form is correct. They want the answer in terms of ħ, so probably either is okay, but maybe they prefer a rationalized denominator? In this case, sqrt(2) in the denominator. But the problem says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", so maybe it's written in terms of \hbar. So the uncertainty is ħ divided by √2. 

Wait, but wait a second. The state is given as an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The components of the state being (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me check whether this state is correctly normalized. To confirm normalization, the sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1. Let's check:

(-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) + 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. That checks out.

Another way to check for errors: the given state should be the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Let me verify quickly if multiplying the P_x matrix by the state gives -ħ times the state. Maybe not necessary for the problem, but just to ensure that the state is correctly given.

The matrix for P_x is:

First row: 0, ħ/√2, 0

Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2

Third row: 0, ħ/√2, 0

Let me compute P_x multiplied by ψ:

First component: 0*(-1/2) + (ħ/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = (ħ/√2)(1/√2) = ħ/2

Second component: (ħ/√2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (ħ/√2)*(-1/2) = (-ħ)/(2√2) + 0 + (-ħ)/(2√2) = (-ħ)/(√2)

Third component: 0*(-1/2) + (ħ/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = (ħ/√2)(1/√2) = ħ/2

So the result of P_x ψ is [ ħ/2 , -ħ/√2 , ħ/2 ]^T. 

Compare this to -ħ times the original state: -ħ * [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T = [ ħ/2 , -ħ/√2, ħ/2 ]^T. Which is exactly P_x ψ. Therefore, indeed, this state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. So everything checks out here, so the given state is correct.

Therefore, my calculation of ΔP_z is correct. It's ħ / √2. I can write this as (ℏ / √2) assuming ħ is h-bar.

Let me just make sure that in the question, is it ħ or ℏ? The original problem statement uses \hbar in the matrices, which is standard. So the answer is ℏ divided by sqrt(2), which can be written as ℏ/sqrt{2} or ℏ√2/2, but since sqrt(2) is irrational, maybe it's better to have rational denominator? Hmmm, not sure. But in quantum mechanics, it's pretty standard to see uncertainties expressed as ℏ over sqrt(2). So I think that's acceptable.

Hence, the uncertainty ΔP_z is ℏ divided by the square root of 2. So the final answer is ℏ/√2.

**Final Answer**
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}$.

Importantly, the state vector here is given in components with respect to the P_z eigenbasis, which means that calculating these expectation values might be simpler.\n\nFirst, let\'s compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, the calculation simplifies because the operator is already diagonal in the given basis. The expectation value can be found by taking the squared magnitudes of each component of the state vector multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue of P_z. Specifically:\n\n⟨P_z⟩ = |c_1|² * ħ + |c_2|² * 0 + |c_3|² * (-ħ)\n\nWhere c_1, c_2, c_3 are the components of the state vector. The state vector components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Note that the coefficients here are real numbers, so their magnitudes squared are just the squares of these coefficients.\n\nCalculating the magnitudes squared:\n\n|c_1|² = (-1/2)² = 1/4\n\n|c_2|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2\n\n|c_3|² = (-1/2)² = 1/4\n\nSo,\n\n⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0\n\nSo the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.\n\nNext, compute ⟨P_z²⟩. The matrix P_z² is just the square of the P_z matrix. Since P_z is diagonal, squaring it would result in a diagonal matrix where each entry is the square of the corresponding entry in P_z. Let me verify:\n\nOriginal P_z matrix entries diagonal elements: ħ, 0, -ħ. Squaring these gives ħ², 0², (-ħ)². That simplifies to:\n\nRow 1: ħ², 0, 0  \nRow 2: 0, 0, 0  \nRow 3: 0, 0, ħ²\n\nHence, similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ is calculated as:\n\n⟨P_z²⟩ = |c_1|² * ħ² + |c_2|² * 0 + |c_3|² * ħ²  \n= (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²)  \n= (1/4 + 1/4)ħ²  \n= (1/2)ħ²\n\nTherefore, the variance (ΔP_z)² is:\n\n⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2)ħ² - 0 = (1/2)ħ²\n\nThus, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of this:\n\nΔP_z = √(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ)/√2\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm that arithmetic. The square root of (1/2 ħ squared) is indeed ħ divided by square root of 2. Because sqrt(1/2)=1/√2, so sqrt(1/2 ħ²)= ħ * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2). So that is correct.\n\nBut let\'s verify again, step by step to make sure.\n\nStarting over.\n\nGiven the state |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), normalized. Let\'s check the normalization first. The sum of the squares of the coefficients is |c1|² + |c2|² + |c3|² = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. So the state is indeed normalized, which is important for computing probabilities. Good.\n\nCalculating ⟨P_z⟩ as sum |ci|² * value: Since the coefficients give the amplitudes in each basis state, |ci|² is the probability for each eigenvalue. The eigenvalues being ħ, 0, -ħ. So,\n\n⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) * ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ). So (1/4 ħ -1/4 ħ) = 0. That seems correct.\n\nThen ⟨P_z²⟩, which is (1/4)*(ħ²) + (1/2)*(0) +1/4*(ħ²), since P_z² in each basis state is (bases are eigenstates of P_z, so P_z² each eigenvalue is (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2=ħ². So the eigenvalues for P_z² are ħ², 0, and ħ², so the third term is 1/4* ħ². So combining 1/4 +1/4= 1/2, so total (1/2)ħ². Then variance is that, sqrt of variance is ħ / sqrt(2), that\'s ΔP_z= ħ √(1/2)= ħ / √2. So that\'s correct.\n\nWait, is there another way to compute the expectation value? Let me check using matrix multiplication to ensure that I\'m not making a mistake.\n\nGiven the state vector as a column vector:\n\nψ = [ -1/2  \n      1/√2  \n      -1/2 ]\n\nBra vector would be the conjugate transpose, which since all entries are real, is just [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]. So ⟨ψ| = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]\n\nComputing ⟨P_z⟩ = ⟨ψ| P_z | ψ ⟩\n\nAgain, the matrix P_z:\n\n[ ħ  0  0  \n  0  0  0  \n  0  0 -ħ ]\n\nSo multiplying P_z |ψ⟩ would give:\n\nFirst component: ħ*(-1/2)  \nSecond component: 0*(1/√2)=0  \nThird component: -ħ*(-1/2)= ħ/2\n\nSo P_z |ψ⟩ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T\n\nThen ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is the inner product of ⟨ψ| with P_z |ψ⟩. That is:\n\n(-1/2)*(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)*(0) + (-1/2)*(ħ/2)\n\n= (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0\n\nSame result as before. So that checks out.\n\n⟨P_z²⟩ is ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩\n\nFirst, as we determined, P_z² is:\n\n[ ħ²  0   0  \n  0   0   0  \n  0   0   ħ² ]\n\nSo multiplying P_z² by |ψ⟩:\n\nFirst component: ħ²*(-1/2)  \nSecond component: 0*(1/√2)  \nThird component: ħ²*(-1/2)\n\nThus P_z² |ψ⟩ = [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]\n\nThen the inner product with ⟨ψ|:\n\n(-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2)\n\n= (ħ²/4) + 0 + (ħ²/4) = ħ²/2\n\nAgain same result. So variance is ħ²/2, and the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2). That calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe the operator normalization here might need to be double checked, but given the original problem defines P_z with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ, which correspond to the diagonal entries. So for state [1,0,0], the P_z would be ħ*1, for [0,1,0], 0, and [0,0,1], -ħ*1. The state given here is a linear combination which is an eigenstate of P_x, which is the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ for P_x.\n\nBut regardless of that, since in the given basis (eigenbasis of P_z), calculations proceed as above. Since the state is correctly given in the P_z eigenbasis, and as the state vector here is: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). The magnitude square checks to (1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4) = 1, so it\'s normalized. Therefore, the expectation values are correct. \n\nHmm, but the result ΔP_z= ħ / sqrt(2). Let\'s think – could there be any mistake here?\n\nWait, is there any step where I could have mixed the operator components? Let\'s check another way. Remember for an operator that\'s already diagonal, such as P_z, the eigenstates are the basis states. Therefore, if you\'re in an arbitrary state, the probabilities of different eigenvalues are the |c_i|². So, here, going by the squared coefficients yes. Since the state is not itself an eigenstate of P_z (though it\'s an eigenstate of P_x), but expressed in the P_z basis. So the probabilities are indeed |c1|² = 1/4 for P_z = ħ, |c2|²=1/2 for P_z=0, and |c3|²=1/4 for P_z= -ħ. Mean is indeed (1/4)ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ)=0, so variance is ⟨P_z²⟩. And ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/4)ħ² + (1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ².\n\nYes, that\'s correct. Hence, the calculation is solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer for ΔP_z is equal to ħ divided by the square root of 2, expressed as ħ/√2. Type-setting that as (hbar)/sqrt(2) which in LaTeX would be \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}. The question says the uncertainty, which is a real positive number, so expressed in terms of ħ.\n\nJust to check if the problem might have mentioned anything else; the given operators are P_x, P_y, P_z. The uncertainty is in P_z, given that the state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state vector is given as (-1/2,1/sqrt(2), -1/2).

To determine the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) for the operator \(P_z\) when the system is in the eigenstate of \(P_x\) corresponding to the eigenvalue \(-\hbar\), we follow these steps:

1. **State Vector**: The given state vector is a column vector with components \((-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)\).

2. **Matrix Form of \(P_z\)**:
   \[
   P_z = \begin{pmatrix}
   \hbar & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & -\hbar
   \end{pmatrix}
   \]

3. **Expectation Value \(\langle P_z \rangle\)**:
   - The components of the state vector are \(c_1 = -1/2\), \(c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}\), and \(c_3 = -1/2\).
   - Calculate the magnitudes squared:
     \[
     |c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
     \]
   - Expectation value:
     \[
     \langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0
     \]

4. **Expectation Value \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\)**:
   - The matrix \(P_z^2\) is diagonal with entries \((\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)\).
   - Expectation value:
     \[
     \langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2
     \]

5. **Uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\)**:
   - Calculate the variance:
     \[
     (\Delta P_z)^2 = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2
     \]
   - Uncertainty:
     \[
     \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]

Thus, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

_z²), and then multiply the result by the original ket vector. Importantly, the state vector here is given in components with respect to the P_z eigenbasis, which means that calculating these expectation values might be simpler.

First, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, the calculation simplifies because the operator is already diagonal in the given basis. The expectation value can be found by taking the squared magnitudes of each component of the state vector multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue of P_z. Specifically:

⟨P_z⟩ = |c_1|² * ħ + |c_2|² * 0 + |c_3|² * (-ħ)

Where c_1, c_2, c_3 are the components of the state vector. The state vector components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Note that the coefficients here are real numbers, so their magnitudes squared are just the squares of these coefficients.

Calculating the magnitudes squared:

|c_1|² = (-1/2)² = 1/4

|c_2|² = (1/√2)² = 1/2

|c_3|² = (-1/2)² = 1/4

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Next, compute ⟨P_z²⟩. The matrix P_z² is just the square of the P_z matrix. Since P_z is diagonal, squaring it would result in a diagonal matrix where each entry is the square of the corresponding entry in P_z. Let me verify:

Original P_z matrix entries diagonal elements: ħ, 0, -ħ. Squaring these gives ħ², 0², (-ħ)². That simplifies to:

Row 1: ħ², 0, 0  
Row 2: 0, 0, 0  
Row 3: 0, 0, ħ²

Hence, similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ is calculated as:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |c_1|² * ħ² + |c_2|² * 0 + |c_3|² * ħ²  
= (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²)  
= (1/4 + 1/4)ħ²  
= (1/2)ħ²

Therefore, the variance (ΔP_z)² is:

⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² = (1/2)ħ² - 0 = (1/2)ħ²

Thus, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of this:

ΔP_z = √(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ)/√2

Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm that arithmetic. The square root of (1/2 ħ squared) is indeed ħ divided by square root of 2. Because sqrt(1/2)=1/√2, so sqrt(1/2 ħ²)= ħ * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2). So that is correct.

But let's verify again, step by step to make sure.

Starting over.

Given the state |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), normalized. Let's check the normalization first. The sum of the squares of the coefficients is |c1|² + |c2|² + |c3|² = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. So the state is indeed normalized, which is important for computing probabilities. Good.

Calculating ⟨P_z⟩ as sum |ci|² * value: Since the coefficients give the amplitudes in each basis state, |ci|² is the probability for each eigenvalue. The eigenvalues being ħ, 0, -ħ. So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) * ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ). So (1/4 ħ -1/4 ħ) = 0. That seems correct.

Then ⟨P_z²⟩, which is (1/4)*(ħ²) + (1/2)*(0) +1/4*(ħ²), since P_z² in each basis state is (bases are eigenstates of P_z, so P_z² each eigenvalue is (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2=ħ². So the eigenvalues for P_z² are ħ², 0, and ħ², so the third term is 1/4* ħ². So combining 1/4 +1/4= 1/2, so total (1/2)ħ². Then variance is that, sqrt of variance is ħ / sqrt(2), that's ΔP_z= ħ √(1/2)= ħ / √2. So that's correct.

Wait, is there another way to compute the expectation value? Let me check using matrix multiplication to ensure that I'm not making a mistake.

Given the state vector as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2  
      1/√2  
      -1/2 ]

Bra vector would be the conjugate transpose, which since all entries are real, is just [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]. So ⟨ψ| = [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

Computing ⟨P_z⟩ = ⟨ψ| P_z | ψ ⟩

Again, the matrix P_z:

[ ħ  0  0  
  0  0  0  
  0  0 -ħ ]

So multiplying P_z |ψ⟩ would give:

First component: ħ*(-1/2)  
Second component: 0*(1/√2)=0  
Third component: -ħ*(-1/2)= ħ/2

So P_z |ψ⟩ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T

Then ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is the inner product of ⟨ψ| with P_z |ψ⟩. That is:

(-1/2)*(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)*(0) + (-1/2)*(ħ/2)

= (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0

Same result as before. So that checks out.

⟨P_z²⟩ is ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩

First, as we determined, P_z² is:

[ ħ²  0   0  
  0   0   0  
  0   0   ħ² ]

So multiplying P_z² by |ψ⟩:

First component: ħ²*(-1/2)  
Second component: 0*(1/√2)  
Third component: ħ²*(-1/2)

Thus P_z² |ψ⟩ = [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]

Then the inner product with ⟨ψ|:

(-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ²/2)

= (ħ²/4) + 0 + (ħ²/4) = ħ²/2

Again same result. So variance is ħ²/2, and the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2). That calculation is correct.

Wait, but I feel like maybe the operator normalization here might need to be double checked, but given the original problem defines P_z with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ, which correspond to the diagonal entries. So for state [1,0,0], the P_z would be ħ*1, for [0,1,0], 0, and [0,0,1], -ħ*1. The state given here is a linear combination which is an eigenstate of P_x, which is the eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ for P_x.

But regardless of that, since in the given basis (eigenbasis of P_z), calculations proceed as above. Since the state is correctly given in the P_z eigenbasis, and as the state vector here is: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). The magnitude square checks to (1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4) = 1, so it's normalized. Therefore, the expectation values are correct. 

Hmm, but the result ΔP_z= ħ / sqrt(2). Let's think – could there be any mistake here?

Wait, is there any step where I could have mixed the operator components? Let's check another way. Remember for an operator that's already diagonal, such as P_z, the eigenstates are the basis states. Therefore, if you're in an arbitrary state, the probabilities of different eigenvalues are the |c_i|². So, here, going by the squared coefficients yes. Since the state is not itself an eigenstate of P_z (though it's an eigenstate of P_x), but expressed in the P_z basis. So the probabilities are indeed |c1|² = 1/4 for P_z = ħ, |c2|²=1/2 for P_z=0, and |c3|²=1/4 for P_z= -ħ. Mean is indeed (1/4)ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ)=0, so variance is ⟨P_z²⟩. And ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/4)ħ² + (1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ².

Yes, that's correct. Hence, the calculation is solid.

Therefore, the answer for ΔP_z is equal to ħ divided by the square root of 2, expressed as ħ/√2. Type-setting that as (hbar)/sqrt(2) which in LaTeX would be \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}. The question says the uncertainty, which is a real positive number, so expressed in terms of ħ.

Just to check if the problem might have mentioned anything else; the given operators are P_x, P_y, P_z. The uncertainty is in P_z, given that the state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state vector is given as (-1/2,1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Since the uncertainty computations directly use the state vector components with the P_z in its own basis, P_x's irrelevant here, except that we know our state is not a state of definite P_z, hence why the uncertainty is non-zero. If ΔP_z were calculated in an eigenstate of P_z, the uncertainty would be zero. But since this state is an eigenstate of P_x not P_z, the uncertainty is non-zero. As per calculation, yea, equal to ħ/sqrt(2).

Double-checking the given matrices. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: Some typos possible. Let's verify. For P_z as per problem statement:

"matrix form of P_z has components in the first row as (ħ,0,0), that in the second row as (0,0,0) and that in the third row as (0,0, -ħ)."

Correct. So the diagonal is ħ, 0, -ħ. So that matches with what I used.

Another possible problem: When the problem said the eigenvectors of P_z, so the basis vectors. Indeed, each standard basis vector (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) would be an eigenvector of P_z as per the given diagonal matrix. So when writing the state as a combination of these, it's in the eigenbasis of P_z. So the components directly contribute to calculation of expectation values for P_z and P_z². Therefore, all steps are correct.

Quick check in literature: Components of uncertainty product. While in spin systems or other angular momentum systems, different components don't necessarily commute. The uncertainty depends on the state. A state with definite S_x would have uncertainties in S_z, etc., similar to position and momentum, but here abstract components. Our calculation follows the standard approach for the uncertainty. So?

I think the answer is correct.


**Final Answer**
The uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}.

To determine the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) for the operator \(P_z\) when the system is in the eigenstate of \(P_x\) given by the column vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}\), we follow these steps:

1. **Normalization Check**:
   The state vector is normalized as the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components is 1:
   \[
   \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1
   \]

2. **Expectation Value \(\langle P_z \rangle\)**:
   Using the diagonal matrix form of \(P_z\) with eigenvalues \(\hbar\), 0, and \(-\hbar\), the expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle P_z \rangle = \left( \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \right) \hbar + \left( \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \right) 0 + \left( \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \right) (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4}\hbar - \frac{1}{4}\hbar = 0
   \]

3. **Expectation Value \(\langle P_z^2 \rangle\)**:
   Squaring the eigenvalues of \(P_z\) results in \(\hbar^2\), 0, and \(\hbar^2\):
   \[
   \langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left( \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \right) \hbar^2 + \left( \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \right) 0 + \left( \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \right) \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2
   \]

4. **Uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\)**:
   The uncertainty is calculated as:
   \[
   \Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

Thus, the uncertainty \(\Delta P_z\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 This will yield a scalar value which is ⟨P_z⟩ or ⟨P_z²⟩.

Let's denote the given state vector as:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2  
        1/√2  
        -1/2 ]

First, check the normalization of |ψ⟩. For the state vector to be properly normalized, the sum of the squared magnitudes of its components must equal 1. Calculating this:

| -1/2 |² + |1/√2|² + | -1/2 |²  
= (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4)  
= (1/4 + 1/4) + 1/2  
= 1/2 + 1/2  
= 1

Perfect, so the state is normalized. Let me proceed to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Starting with ⟨P_z⟩:

⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩

Since P_z is diagonal, the calculation is straightforward. The expectation value would be the sum over the eigenvalues multiplied by the square magnitude of the corresponding components in the state vector. Moreover, since the eigenvalues for the basis states are ħ, 0, -ħ for the first, second, and third components respectively:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( |-1/2 |² ) * ħ + ( |1/√2 |² ) * 0 + ( |-1/2 |² ) * (-ħ )

= (1/4)ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ)  
= (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ  
= 0

So the expectation value of P_z is zero. Now compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ, squaring it will just square the diagonal entries:

P_z² has diagonal entries (ħ², 0, ħ²), since the first element is (ħ)² = ħ², the second 0² = 0, and the third (-ħ)² = ħ².

Thus:

⟨P_z²⟩ = ( |-1/2 |² ) * ħ² + ( |1/√2 |² ) * 0 + ( |-1/2 |² ) * ħ²  
= (1/4)ħ² + 0 + (1/4)ħ²  
= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ²  
= (1/2)ħ²  

Therefore, ΔP_z = √(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ) = √( (1/2)ħ² - 0 ) = √(1/2 ħ² ) = (ħ) / √2. 

Simplifying further, this is equivalent to ħ / √2. Choose whichever form is preferred. Let me check once more for errors.

Potential pitfall: Assuming that just because the components in |ψ⟩ for P_z eigenstates directly convert to probability amplitudes for each P_z value. Indeed, because the basis is that of P_z eigenstates, |c_1|² gives the probability of measuring P_z = ħ, |c_2|² probability of P_z =0, and so on.

So, expectation P_z is (1/4) ħ - (1/4) ħ = 0, and Var(P_z) = (1/4)* ħ² + (1/4)* ħ² = (1/2) ħ² as we found, leading to ΔP_z = sqrt(1/2) ħ. Which is indeed ħ / √2. So all seems consistent.


**Final Answer**
The uncertainty \( \Delta P_z \) of \( P_z \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}}\).
