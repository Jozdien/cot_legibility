# Original Question

You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? 
After tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:
- resistance of g1: 75% of control
- resistance of g2: 0% from control
- resistance of g3: 50% from control
-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control
- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control
- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control

Which conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?

From the experimental results and analysis, the interaction between the genes G1, G2, and G3 in anthracnose resistance can be summarized as follows:

1. **G2 is a critical transcription factor downstream of G1 and G3**:  
   - The knockout of G2 (g2) results in 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is essential for resistance.  
   - Double mutants involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3) also exhibit 0% resistance, confirming that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This means G2 acts downstream and is indispensable for resistance, regardless of the status of G1 or G3.  

2. **G1 and G3 act in partially redundant, additive pathways to activate G2**:  
   - Single knockouts of G1 (g1, 75% resistance) and G3 (g3, 50% resistance) show reduced but partial resistance, implying each gene contributes to activating G2.  
   - The double mutant g1g3 (10% resistance) demonstrates severe impairment, worse than either single mutant. This suggests G1 and G3 operate in **parallel pathways** that synergistically boost G2 activity. Loss of both drastically reduces G2 activation, leading to near-complete susceptibility.  

3. **Hierarchical and functional relationships**:  
   - G2 integrates signaling from both G1 and G3. Each pathway contributes to G2’s ability to confer resistance, but neither is sufficient alone for full activity.  
   - G1’s contribution is smaller (25% loss in g1), while G3’s is larger (50% loss in g3), reflecting differing weights of their upstream regulatory roles.  

**Conclusion**:  
G1 and G3 are upstream components in two partially redundant pathways that activate the transcription factor G2. G2 is indispensable for triggering resistance, acting as the central hub. The additive effects of G1 and G3 ensure robustness in activating G2, enabling the plant to maintain significant resistance even if one pathway is compromised. This hierarchy explains the observed resistance levels in the mutants.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's tackle this genetics problem. So, we're looking at three genes—G1, G2, G3—and their mutants to see how they contribute to anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The question is figuring out the interactions between these genes, especially since at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. 

First, the data shows the resistance levels in single and double mutants. The control is 100% resistant. Let's list the results again to make sure I get this right:

- g1: 75% (so knocking out G1 reduces resistance by 25%)
- g2: 0% (knocking out G2 completely removes resistance)
- g3: 50% (knocking out G3 halves the resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (double mutant of G1 and G3 has very low resistance)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2, which is already 0%)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2 as well)

Hmm. So starting with single mutants: G2 is critical since its knockout leads to 0% resistance. That suggests G2 is a major player. When G2 is non-functional, no resistance. 

Looking at the other single mutants: g1 has higher resistance (75%) than g3 (50%), which is still higher than g2. So maybe G3 is more important than G1 but less than G2. 

Now in double mutants: combining g1 and g3 (both of which have partial resistance when single mutants) gives 10%, which is much worse than either single. So G1 and G3 probably act in separate pathways that add up to their individual contributions. But wait, in the double mutant, it's less than additive? Because 0.5*0.75 = 37.5%, but actual is 10%, so maybe they're in the same pathway but with partial redundancy. 

But wait, when combining g1 and g3 mutants: Consider if they work in the same pathway. If G1 is upstream of G3, then you'd expect the double mutant to have similar resistance to g3. But in this case, G3's resistance is 50%, and combining with g1 gives 10% which is worse. So when you knock out both G1 and G3, their combined effect is multiplicative? Maybe there's an additive effect but in separate pathways?

Alternatively, think about epistatic relationships. Since G2 is at 0%, maybe G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3? Let's see. Since g2 is 0%, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are also 0%. That's expected because if G2 isn't working, the others might not matter. So that suggests G2 is downstream of G1 and G3. Because when you have g1g2, the phenotype is the same as g2 alone, implying that G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, g2g3 same as g2. Therefore, G2 is epistatic. This would mean that G2 acts downstream of both G1 and G3. So G1 and G3 may regulate G2. 

But since G1 has a partial effect when knocked out (75%), and G3 is partially effective (50%), but G2 knockout totally abolishes resistance, then maybe G2 is part of a pathway that's essential for resistance. So G1 and G3 act through G2. Let me test that. If the genes function in a linear pathway G1 → G3 → G2, then knocking out G2 would lead to 0% resistance, which it does. Knocking out G3 would block the pathway upstream of G2, leading to same as G2 knockout? But no, G3 is 50%. That's inconsistent. So that might not be the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that is regulated by G1 and G3. Maybe G1 and G3 both contribute to the activation of G2. If there's partial redundancy between G1 and G3, then when one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. So maybe G1 and G3 work upstream of G2. So when you knock out G1, G3 can partially compensate (so G2 expression or activity is reduced but not absent; hence the 75% resistance). If you knock out G3, then G1 can do the same but with lower efficiency (so 50% resistance). If you knock out both, G2 isn't properly activated, leading to near-zero resistance (10%). But G2 is a TF here, which in this case would be the main gene. However, but if G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream, how do we interpret the data? Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So if G2 is the transcription factor, and it's upstream, then knocking out G2 leads to all downstream genes not being expressed. But in this case, if G2 was upstream, then knocking out G1 or G3 would affect genes downstream of G2 (but in the data, G2 knockout leads to lower resistance). Alternatively, if G2 is downstream, like being activated by G1 and G3, then maybe the model holds. 

So if G1 and G3 are upstream of G2, which is a TF. Say, G1 and G3 activate G2. When either is knocked out, you can't activate G2 as effectively, leading to decreased resistance. G1 only being knocked out leads to 75% (25% reduction), G3 knocked out leads to 50% (less activation of G2?), but G2 knockout is 0%. The double knockout (g1g3) would lead to even less activation, hence even lower resistance (10%). 

But according to the data, in g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So perhaps G1 and G3 each contribute to the activation of G2, in an additive way. Let's say, for example, that G1 provides 50% activation and G3 50%, so together they make 100%, and knocking out either reduces it. But how does this map to the single mutant resistances?

Wait, for single mutants:

g1: 75% resistance. So maybe G1 contributes 25% (since WT is 100%, and g1 is missing 25%). But then G3: 50% would mean that G3 contributes 50%. But when you knock both (g1g3), you're missing 25% + 50% = 75%, so remaining resistance is 25%—but in reality, it's 10%, which is lower. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 have overlapping function. Wait, this is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, the resistance is multiplicative. For instance, if each gene contributes to an efficiency. If G1 normally works at 75%, and G3 at 50%, then perhaps the combined effect of both being active would be 75% * 50% = 37.5%? But the WT is 100%, so that can't be.

Wait, I need a different approach. Let's recall that when two genes are in the same pathway, their double mutant's phenotype is similar to the more severe single mutant. If they're in parallel pathways, then the double mutant's phenotype is additive or worse than additive.

In this case, g2 is already at 0% in single mutant, so any double mutant including g2 will also be 0%, which indicates that G2's pathway is critical, so if it's gone, nothing else matters. Hence, G2 is downstream.

Looking at the other double mutants: g1g3 has 10%, which is lower than either single mutant (75% and 50%). That suggests that G1 and G3 act in separate pathways, or perhaps synergistically. If their effects are additive, then 75% (g1) and 50% (g3) add up to, maybe 25% remaining (since the missing 25% (g1) and 50% (g3)), but the actual outcome is more severe.  So if each mutation reduces resistance multiplicatively, maybe: 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375. But their double mutant is 10% instead. 10% might suggest that the effect is worse, like the combination is compounding. 

But how do these pathways interact? Let's suppose that both G1 and G3 must be functional to allow the resistance. But no, because G1 alone can have 75%, so that'd imply some residual function.

Alternatively, maybe G1 is required for G3's function. If G1 is upstream of G3, then a g1 mutant would have lower G3 activity, but in this case, the g1 mutant still has 75%. But then when you knock out G3 alone, it's down to 50%. If they were in a linear pathway, then maybe the g1 affects it but not completely, perhaps via partial redundancy.

Alternatively, considering epistasis. If two mutations result in a phenotype that is similar to one of them (as per g2g3 and g1g2 having same as g2), that tells us that G2 is epistatic. So, so G2's pathway is affected if either G2 is mutated, or the upstream genes. So upstream genes (G1 and G3) contribute to G2 function. Thus, when G1 is KO, you have 75%, when G3 is KO, 50%, and when both are KO, only 10%. Thus, implying that all three genes (G1, G3, and G2) are part of a single pathway. Wait. Let's try putting the genes in a hierarchy where G2 is downstream. Let’s say that G1 and G3 work on different pathways that both influence G2. For instance, G1 provides a certain level of activation, and G3 provides another. So G2 is the TF that integrates their signals. So when either G1 or G3 is KO, G2 doesn't get as activated. However, in the case of G2 KO, then the pathway is completely blocked, giving 0%. In the single KO of G1, the remaining activation via G3 allows partial function (so resistance is higher than if both are KO), etc. 

Another way to approach: if G2 is essential and G1 and G3 enhance G2's function. So when G1 is KO, there's less enhancement (reduced resistance), but when both G1 and G3 are KO, even less? But then why G3's single mutant has more impact (50%)? Because G1 enhancement and G3 enhancement are overlapping? Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that both contribute to G2’s activation. Therefore, losing both gives drastic effects, but if either is present, some activation occurs. 

If G1 and G3 each partially activate G2, then in WT, full activation. If G1 is missing, G3 can activate G2 a bit (so resistance 75% of WT). If G3 is missing, G1 can do a bit (50% of WT). But together, if both are missing, only 10% activation? If maybe they both add up their effects. 

But how does G2 mutation tie in here? Since G2 KO is 0%, as per the results. So if G2 is definitely part of the same pathway and downstream.

Also, the question mentions that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream. So possibilities are that G2 is a TF downstream, regulated by G1 and G3.

So the model would be:

G1 → activates → G2,

G3 → activates → G2,

but separately. Hence, knocking out G1 or G3 alone partially reduces G2's activation.

For example:

In WT: G1 and G3 work to activate G2. So if either one is missing, G2 is still activated at some level. If both are missing, then G2 can't be activated much. But wait, in this case, the double mutant would have almost no G2 activity. But in the data, the double mutant’s resistance is 10%. 

But in our data, the G2 mutant is 0%, so if G1 and G3 both KO (g1g3), and G2 is still present, then how come the resistance is lower than when just G3 is KO (which is 50%) and G1 is KO (75%)? Need to adjust the model.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for G2's activation. For example, both G1 and G3 are necessary for G2 to function. So, in that case, a G1 or G3 KO would partially disrupt G2’s activation, leading to intermediate resistance. But the double KO would have worse than either single (maybe additive). But their actual resistance is 10%. But G2's KO is 0% regardless.

Another angle: the three genes could form a genetic pathway where both G1 and G3 are required for G2's function. However, possible redundancy. For example, if G2 can be activated via G1 or via G3. So deleting G1 disables one pathway (activation via G1 ), so the remaining activation via G3 allows 75% resistance. Deleting G3 leaves activation via G1, leading to 50% (indicating G3's contribution is bigger). Deleting both, no activation pathways, so G2 isn't activated, leading to G2-like phenotype (0%). But in the data, g1g3 is 10% not 0%. So this doesn't exactly fit.

Wait, unless there's a minor alternative pathway, so when both G1 and G3 are KO, another gene or low-level activity allows minimal resistance (10%). But the original premise says that these three genes are the candidates, so probably no others involved. 

Alternatively, perhaps G2 isn't downstream but maybe G1 and G3 act in a pathway that's modulated by G2. For example, G2 is upstream and activates both G1 and G3. Then, if G2 is KO, those downstream genes aren’t active, leading to 0% resistance. But then, if G1 is KO, the pathway through G1 is blocked, but G3 (activated by G2) remains functional, leading to 75% resistance. Similarly, G3 KO: since G2 activates G3 which then contributes to resistance. If G3 is KO, then only G1 (also activated by G2) contributes. But if G1's effect is 75% when KO as a single gene, and G3's KO is 50%, which seems conflicting. If G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2 in parallel pathways, each contributing 50% and 25%, respectively, then knocking out G1 causes 25% loss (75% remaining), and G3 KO causes 50% loss(50% remaining). However, then the double mutant would be 100% - 75% = 25%, but in reality the double mutant is 10%. Hmm, not a perfect fit.

Perhaps instead, either G1 is involved in a pathway additive to G2 and G3. But then, the total confusion is too much.

Looking back at the key point that g2 is epistatic to both g1 and g3, since all the doubles involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3) result in 0% like g2 alone. Therefore, G2 is acting downstream of G1 and G3. This would support a model where both G1 and G3 regulate G2. The resistance conferred by G2 is dependent on G1 and G3. Hence if G1 or G3 is inactive, G2's activity is impeded, but not totally absent. But in which case, when both G1 and G3 are inactive, G2 is significantly inactive as well, leading to even lower resistance, perhaps. Wait, but how does that reconcile the numbers?

When G2 is knocked out (0% resistance). When G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%. So, with G1 absent, G2's function is partially impaired. When G3 is absent, G2's function is 50% active.

But then how do G1 and G3 contribute to G2? 

Perhaps G1 enhances G3's activity, and G3 activates G2. So in g1 mutant, G3's ability to activate G2 is reduced (hence 75% lost?), which doesn't quite add up. If G3 is needed to activate G2, then you lose G3 and G2 can't be activated, leading to 0%. But that's not consistent with data, as G3 mutant still has 50%.

Alternatively, maybe each of G1 and G3 contribute to G2's activation equally. If one is missing, you get 50% activation. If both are missing, less. If G1 is a partial enhancer. No, not really.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are each partially redundant in activating G2. So when either is KO, G2 is partly active. When both are KO, G2 is not active. Let's see: 

If activating G2 requires input from either G1 or G3. Then, WT would have full activation. If G1 is KO, G3 handles activation, so g1: maybe G3 can handle 75%, while G1 handles 25%? But then why is the single G3 KO 50%? That seems inconsistent. Maybe in reverse: G1 contributes 75% and G3 contributes 50%. But if the presence of G1 alone would not allow full activity. No, this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, if G2 is necessary for resistance and acts as a TF. Suppose that pathways leading to G2's activation have two branches: one requires G1 and the other requires G3. Each branch can partially activate G2. So, in single mutants:

- For G1 KO (they lose branch one), resistance is 75% of wt. So the activation level is decreased via the other branch (G3 dependent). If we reach G2's activation 75% as well. 

For G3 KO, activation due to G1 branch, perhaps 50% of the full activation. But then, when both G1 and G3 are gone, activation of G2 plummets, hence resistance at 10%. This might explain that data, but how G2's knockout is 0%? 

In this model, G2 is the mediator of the entire pathway. Hence, if G2 isn't there, it doesn't matter how much activation: resistance is 0%. But in the G1/G3 knockout, since there's still a little activation (from perhaps leaky expression), it's 10%. 

But this is speculation. Let me try an epistasis test:

If knocking out G2 leads to a complete loss of resistance, and G1 and G3's KO have partial loss suggesting they are acting upstream of G2, so G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. 

Which is confirmed by the double mutants of G1 and G2 having the same as G2. Similarly for G3 and G2. Hence, G2 is indeed downstream.

Therefore, G2 is the key gene, and the product of G2 is necessary for resistance. Now, G1 and G3 are promoting the function of G2.

But then when you KO G1 or G3, you still have some G2 function, which accounts for 75% and 50% respectively. So the presence of G1 and G3 each contribute to increase G2's effectiveness.

In the model, G1 and G3 are acting in a pathway that modulates G2's activity. If you remove G1, you get some loss but not total; same with G3. If you remove both, the G2 activity is nearly eliminated (10% resistance). But the low epsagon osischer effect. 

Alternatively, maybe G2’s own function is boosted by products of G1 and G3. For instance, suppose that G1 and G3 encode proteins or factors that upregulate the transcription factor G2. Hence, if either G1 or G3 is missing, G2 isn't produced sufficiently, leading to lower resistance. However, mutant data suggests the resistance is actually higher when G1 is missing (75%) compared to G3 (50%). So could G2's function be suppressed by the presence of G1 or G3? Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that in turn activates the resistance genes, and G1 and G3 are also involved in other layers of defense. But that would take us into more complex interactions.

Wait, considering the double mutants:

The g1g3 resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single. If they were providing additive contributions, 75% (g1) and 50% (g3) would have a combinatorial effect. Let's see, if in wt cells, they contribute independently, and in double mutant you subtract both effects. So, if 100% is WT, The most you could deduct from two genes would be (100% -75%=25%) and (100% -50% =50%), so perhaps align in a way that compound their effects. 25% minus does not straightforwardly make sense. Wait, perhaps applicable if presence in one gene can perform a certain percentage rescue.

Alternatively, G1 works as a positive regulator. Losing G1 (resistance drops to 75%), hence normally contributing 25% of the resistance. Losing G3 causes resistance to drop to 50% (so contributes 50% of the resistance). These numbers probably via additive pathways.

So total resistance would be 100% - (G1 contribution + G3 contribution) = 25% retained. But but the actual double is 10%. Possible they're interacting in a non-additive way. Suppose each KO leads to partial loss, but combining them push it further. Perhaps another angle—aquantitive model where each gene's contribution is multiplicative.

WT resistance is product of individual contributions. Hmm. For example, if G1 contributes 0.75 (i.e., when KO, 75% resistance — no. Wait, when G1 is KO, that plant still has 75% resistance, so perhaps the presence of G1 contributes 25% and other genes contribute the remaining. This is becoming tangled.

Another idea: track epistasis. If the phenotype of a g1g3 double mutant is more severe than either single, it suggests that each gene contributes something, perhaps redundant or additive pathways.

But given G2 is essential (because its KO is 0% resistant), hence pathways G1 and G3 might still depend on G2.

So, considering all this, the likely scenario is:

G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3, and their products are required to activate G2. However, partial activation can occur if one of them is missing, leading to the resistance not being completely abolished. But when both G1 and G3 are missing, activation of G2 decreases strongly. OR it could be that G2 can be activated through either G1 or G3, so if both are missing, it can't be activated.

But why do single mutants of G1 and G3 have partial resistance? E.g., if G1 activates G2, when you knock out G1, but G3 can also activate G2—so then, why would a G1 single mutant have any resistance. 

Ah, if G1 and G3 work in parallel pathways upstream of G2. Each pathway is partially responsible for activating G2. So, if you remove G1, the G3 pathway still activates G2 at partial efficiency (say, yielding 75% resistance). If you remove G3, the G1 pathway allows G2 activation (50% resistance). If you remove both (g1g3), neither can activate G2 togethe leading to 10% (maybe some residual activation). And G2 knockout is 0% because G2's product is essential.

This would align with the data where:

- Only wild-type G1 and G3 can fully activate G2, leading to 100% resistance.

- G1 KO leaves G3 doing partial activation (75%).

- G3 KO leaves G1 doing partial activation (50%).

- G2's product is the critical factor. If gone, no pathway from any gene can activate response.

Then, the physical hierarchy would be:

G1 → activates → G2 

G3 → activates → G2 

and both these pathways can partially compensate for each other. So G2 is a key gene (TF) that relies on G1 and G3 for its activation. 

Thus, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, and since the double knockout of G1 and G3 lowers resistance even more than their respective singles, their effects on G2's activation are additive. Finally, since the transcription factor is supposed to be upstream (if a gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others) according to the question, but in our hierarchy G2 is downstream. Hmm. So which of these genes is the transcription factor?

The problem states that “at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)”. So possible  that G2 is a TF acting downstream, while upstream genes are G1 and G3. But at least one is a TF that's upstream. It could be that however that transcription factor among them, say G1 is a transcription factor upstream of G2 and G3, but this may not fit the data. 

Alternatively, the transcription factor is G2. According to the earlier conclusion, G2 is downstream, but if genes are activating G2, then G2 could be a TF. For instance, G2 is a TF that promotes resistance genes, and its activation is promoted by G1 and G3.

Hence, G2 is the transcription factor. Since the KO of G2 eliminates all resistance, and the other KOs reduce activity based on their contributions. 

Thus, the conclusion would be that G2 is the transcription factor acting downstream, its activation is facilitated by G1 and G3. G1 and G3 function in separate pathways required for the full activation of G2 caused by the pathogen. The sensitivity of the double mutants, especially the g1g3's low resistance, shows that these two genes work additively, with their combined absence severely hampering G2’s role in conferring resistance.

Therefore, functionally, G1 and G3 act in parallel pathways that both contribute to the activation of the transcription factor G2, which is essential for full resistance. Therefore, the genes' interactions can be explained as G2 being epistatic to G1 and G3, and the incomplete suppression in single mutants indicates that there's partial redundancy between G1 and G3 in their capacity to activate G2.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's tackle this genetics problem. So, we're looking at three genes—G1, G2, G3—and their mutants to see how they contribute to anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The question is figuring out the interactions between these genes, especially since at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. 

First, the data shows the resistance levels in single and double mutants. The control is 100% resistant. Let's list the results again to make sure I get this right:

- g1: 75% (so knocking out G1 reduces resistance by 25%)
- g2: 0% (knocking out G2 completely removes resistance)
- g3: 50% (knocking out G3 halves the resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (double mutant of G1 and G3 has very low resistance)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2, which is already 0%)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2 as well)

Hmm. So starting with single mutants: G2 is critical since its knockout leads to 0% resistance. That suggests G2 is a major player. When G2 is non-functional, no resistance. 

Looking at the other single mutants: g1 has higher resistance (75%) than g3 (50%), which is still higher than g2. So maybe G3 is more important than G1 but less than G2. 

Now in double mutants: combining g1 and g3 (both of which have partial resistance when single mutants) gives 10%, which is much worse than either single. So G1 and G3 probably act in separate pathways that add up to their individual contributions. But wait, in the double mutant, it's less than additive? Because 0.5*0.75 = 37.5%, but actual is 10%, so maybe they're in the same pathway but with partial redundancy. 

But wait, when combining g1 and g3 mutants: Consider if they work in the same pathway. If G1 is upstream of G3, then you'd expect the double mutant to have similar resistance to g3. But in this case, G3's resistance is 50%, and combining with g1 gives 10% which is worse. So when you knock out both G1 and G3, their combined effect is multiplicative? Maybe there's an additive effect but in separate pathways?

Alternatively, think about epistatic relationships. Since G2 is at 0%, maybe G2 is downstream of both G1 and G3? Let's see. Since g2 is 0%, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are also 0%. That's expected because if G2 isn't working, the others might not matter. So that suggests G2 is downstream of G1 and G3. Because when you have g1g2, the phenotype is the same as g2 alone, implying that G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, g2g3 same as g2. Therefore, G2 is epistatic. This would mean that G2 acts downstream of both G1 and G3. So G1 and G3 may regulate G2. 

But since G1 has a partial effect when knocked out (75%), and G3 is partially effective (50%), but G2 knockout totally abolishes resistance, then maybe G2 is part of a pathway that's essential for resistance. So G1 and G3 act through G2. Let me test that. If the genes function in a linear pathway G1 → G3 → G2, then knocking out G2 would lead to 0% resistance, which it does. Knocking out G3 would block the pathway upstream of G2, leading to same as G2 knockout? But no, G3 is 50%. That's inconsistent. So that might not be the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that is regulated by G1 and G3. Maybe G1 and G3 both contribute to the activation of G2. If there's partial redundancy between G1 and G3, then when one is knocked out, the other can partially compensate. So maybe G1 and G3 work upstream of G2. So when you knock out G1, G3 can partially compensate (so G2 expression or activity is reduced but not absent; hence the 75% resistance). If you knock out G3, then G1 can do the same but with lower efficiency (so 50% resistance). If you knock out both, G2 isn't properly activated, leading to near-zero resistance (10%). But G2 is a TF here, which in this case would be the main gene. However, but if G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream, how do we interpret the data? Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So if G2 is the transcription factor, and it's upstream, then knocking out G2 leads to all downstream genes not being expressed. But in this case, if G2 was upstream, then knocking out G1 or G3 would affect genes downstream of G2 (but in the data, G2 knockout leads to lower resistance). Alternatively, if G2 is downstream, like being activated by G1 and G3, then maybe the model holds. 

So if G1 and G3 are upstream of G2, which is a TF. Say, G1 and G3 activate G2. When either is knocked out, you can't activate G2 as effectively, leading to decreased resistance. G1 only being knocked out leads to 75% (25% reduction), G3 knocked out leads to 50% (less activation of G2?), but G2 knockout is 0%. The double knockout (g1g3) would lead to even less activation, hence even lower resistance (10%). 

But according to the data, in g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So perhaps G1 and G3 each contribute to the activation of G2, in an additive way. Let's say, for example, that G1 provides 50% activation and G3 50%, so together they make 100%, and knocking out either reduces it. But how does this map to the single mutant resistances?

Wait, for single mutants:

g1: 75% resistance. So maybe G1 contributes 25% (since WT is 100%, and g1 is missing 25%). But then G3: 50% would mean that G3 contributes 50%. But when you knock both (g1g3), you're missing 25% + 50% = 75%, so remaining resistance is 25%—but in reality, it's 10%, which is lower. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 have overlapping function. Wait, this is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, the resistance is multiplicative. For instance, if each gene contributes to an efficiency. If G1

# Anthropic completion

Let's address this genetics problem concerning three genes—G1, G2, G3—and their mutants to determine their contributions to anthracnose resistance in white lupine. We need to understand the interactions between these genes, particularly since at least one functions as a transcription factor upstream of others.

To begin, let's review the resistance data for single and double mutants. The wild-type control shows 100% resistance. The results are:

- g1: 75% (a 25% reduction in resistance from wild-type)
- g2: 0% (complete elimination of resistance)
- g3: 50% (resistance reduced by half)
- g1g3: 10% (substantially reduced resistance in this double mutant)
- g2g3: 0% (identical to the g2 single mutant)
- g1g2: 0% (also identical to the g2 single mutant)

Examining the single mutants first: G2 appears critical since its mutation results in 0% resistance. G3 seems more important than G1 based on their respective resistance levels when mutated (50% versus 75%).

For the double mutants: the g1g3 combination yields 10% resistance, which is significantly lower than either single mutant alone. This is less than what would be expected from a simple multiplicative effect (0.5*0.75 = 37.5%), suggesting partial redundancy within the same pathway rather than independent pathways.

Looking at epistatic relationships, the fact that g2 shows 0% resistance and both double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0% resistance suggests G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This indicates G2 likely acts downstream of both G1 and G3.

Since G1 and G3 mutations still allow partial resistance (75% and 50% respectively), while G2 mutation eliminates resistance entirely, we might hypothesize that G1 and G3 regulate G2 activity, which is essential for resistance.

The data doesn't support a simple linear pathway (G1 → G3 → G2) because knocking out G3 would then produce the same phenotype as knocking out G2, which isn't the case.

A more plausible model is that G1 and G3 both contribute to G2 activation, with partial redundancy. When G1 is knocked out, G3 can partially compensate (yielding 75% resistance). When G3 is knocked out, G1 provides less effective compensation (50% resistance). When both are knocked out, G2 activation is severely compromised, resulting in only 10% resistance.

If G1 contributes 25% to resistance and G3 contributes 50%, we'd expect the double mutant to retain 25% resistance, but it's actually 10%. This suggests their combined effect isn't strictly additive, possibly due to some overlap in function or a more complex regulatory relationship.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's address this genetics problem. We are examining three genes—G1, G2, and G3—and their mutants to understand their roles in providing anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The focus is on discerning the interactions among these genes, particularly since at least one is an upstream transcription factor for the others.

Initially, the data outlines resistance levels in single and double mutants, with the control exhibiting 100% resistance. Here are the results to ensure clarity:

- The g1 mutant has 75% resistance, indicating that removing G1 reduces resistance by 25%.
- The g2 mutant exhibits 0% resistance, signifying that losing G2 eliminates resistance completely.
- For the g3 mutant, resistance is 50%, halving the normal resistance.
- The g1g3 double mutant shows 10% resistance, which is significantly low.
- The g2g3 mutant remains at 0%, identical to g2.
- The g1g2 mutant is also at 0%, same as g2.

Examining single mutants: G2 is crucial since its absence results in 0% resistance, indicating G2's major role. With G2 inactive, no resistance can be conferred.

Analyzing other single mutants: g1 has 75% resistance, which is greater than g3's 50%, yet both are higher than g2. This suggests G3 is more significant than G1, but less than G2.

For double mutants: combining g1 and g3, each with partial resistance as single mutants, results in 10%, worse than either on its own. This implies G1 and G3 likely operate in separate pathways that contribute individually. However, the double mutant's result (10%) is less than their combined prediction (37.5%), suggesting they could be in the same pathway with partial redundancy.

Reassessing the g1 and g3 interaction: If they're in the same pathway and G1 is upstream of G3, the double mutant would mimic g3's resistance. Yet here, G3's resistance is 50%, and their combination is 10%, worse than individually, implying a multiplicative relationship.

Considering epistatic interactions: G2 at 0% suggests it is downstream of G1 and G3. In both double mutants (g1g2, g2g3), resistance is 0%, showing when G2 is lost, G1 or G3's roles are irrelevant, implying G2 is epistatic to them. Therefore, G2 likely acts downstream of G1 and G3, meaning G1 and G3 may regulate G2.

Since g1 results in 75% resistance and g3 in 50%, while g2 knockout fully abolishes resistance, G2 might be crucial for resistance pathways. G1 and G3 might act through G2. Testing this: in a linear pathway G1 → G3 → G2, G2 knockout results in 0% resistance. G3 knockout upstream should mimic G2 knockout, yet it doesn't, as G3's resistance is 50%—indicating an inconsistency.

Instead, G2 could be a transcription factor influenced by G1 and G3. Possibly, G1 and G3 both help activate G2, with partial redundancy. When one is missing, the other somewhat compensates: G1 deletion leads to reduced but existing resistance (75%), as does G3 (50%). A double knockout nearly deactivates G2, leaving 10% resistance. Thus, G2 as a transcription factor acts as the central regulator.

Reassessing data: with G2 as a TF upstream, its knockout silences downstream genes, contrary to observation. If G2 is downstream, activated by G1 and G3, the model seems valid.

Conclusively, G1 and G3 are likely upstream of G2, which acts as the transcription factor. G1 and G3 activate G2; knocking out G1 reduces activation (75% resistance), as does G3 (50% resistance). The double knockout further drops activation, resulting in 10% resistance. If each contributes additively, say G1 offers 50% and G3 another 50%, the system when disrupted reflects experimentally in single mutants.

For single mutants: g1 at 75% might mean G1 contributes 25% (with WT as 100% and g1 missing 25%). Meanwhile, G3's 50% shows it gives 50%. If both are knocked out (g1g3), losing 75% results in 25% resistance—but experimentally found as 10%. This discrepancy hints at overlapping functions between G1 and G3.

Consider resistance as multiplicative—each gene playing a role in pathway efficiency.

G1 and G3 are both upstream of G2 (alternatively parallel pathways converging on G2). Knockout of G1 reduces G2 activity, similar for G3. Then, knockouts of both would have more severe defects. If in this model, WT resistance is dependent on G2, then loss of G1 or G3 would reduce G2 activity, leading to reduced resistance (which matches single mutants: G1 KO 75%, G3 50%), and double G1/G3 KO would have even lower (10%), while G2 KO is 0%.\n\nBut since in the problem statement, we are told at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream. If G2 is the TF, it might be downstream.\n\nSo, in this model, G1 and G3 both contribute to activating G2 (the transcription factor). When either is missing, G2 activity is partially compromised. When both are missing, G2 is almost inactive. So the resistance is via G2 activity. Then the resistance level would correspond to G2 activity:\n\n- WT: G2 fully active (100% resistance)\n\n- G1 KO: G2 activity is reduced (75% resistance)\n\n- G3 KO: G2 activity is further reduced (50% resistance)\n\n- G1/G3 KO: G2 activity is barely there (10%)\n\n- G2 KO: 0% activity (0% resistance)\n\nBut how does this fit? Let's think about the additive effect. If G1 is responsible for, say, 50% of G2's activation, and G3 for another 50%, then if you knock out G1, G3 can still do 50% → resistance is 50%, but the observed G1 KO is 75%. Hmm, not matching. Wait, if G1 provides some function that when absent, G2 can still be partially active. Alternatively, the model might be that G1 and G3 have overlapping functions in activating G2, so losing one allows the other to partially compensate.\n\nFor example, G1 and G3 produce factors that activate G2. If either is present, G2 is partially active. If both are present, fully active. If one is KO, the other can still contribute. For example, the activity of G2 might be 1 - (product of the reduced factors from each gene). But this is getting vague.\n\nAlternatively, the expression level of G2 might depend on both G1 and G3. So G1 and G3 each contribute to increasing the expression level of G2. So if G1 is knocked out, expression of G2 is 75% of WT; if G3 is knocked out, expression of G2 is 50% of WT. If both are knocked out, G2 expression is, say, 25% of WT, but since the resistance in double KO is 10%, that might not match. But this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, it could be that G1 and G3 are acting in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, and G2 is a component that integrates their signals. For instance, one pathway is G1-dependent and provides X% resistance, another is G3-dependent and provides Y%, and G2 is required for both pathways. Wait, but no: if G2 is required for both pathways, then knocking out G2 would negate both, giving 0% resistance. Then, if you have G1 KO, the G1-dependent pathway is down but the G3-dependent (via G2) is active. But if G2 is required for both pathways, then even if G3 is active, if G2 isn't there, their pathway isn't active. \n\nAlternatively, G2 is part of both pathways. But I might need to diagram this.\n\nAnother approach is using the concept of epistasis. If the phenotype of a double mutant is similar to one of the single mutants, that gene is epistatic, meaning it acts downstream. For example, if in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is the same as g2 (0%), which it is. Since null allele of G2 (g2) causes the same as g1g2, that implies that G2 is epistatic to G1. So G1 acts upstream of G2. Similarly, if we see that g3g2's resistance is same as g2, so G2 is epistatic to G3, so G3 is upstream of G2.\n\nNow, let's check G1G3 double mutant: 10%. Since this is worse than either single mutant (75% vs.50%→ 10%), this is called a synergistic effect. Synergistic interaction suggests that they function in parallel pathways. Since the effect is more than additive (or worse than additive), meaning that the two genes might function in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So if you knock out both, the total resistance is the product (like, 0.75*0.5 ≈ 0.375, but in reality it's worse:0.1), but maybe that model is incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that both activate G2. So each pathway contributes to G2's activation. Without G1, activation is reduced, without G3, also reduced. If both are knocked out, G2 activation is almost absent. Thus, in that case:\n\n- WT: G1 and G3 both active → G2 fully active →100%\n\n- g1: G3 active, G1 not → G2 partial (say, 75%)\n\n- g3: G1 active, G3 not → G2 partial (50%)\n\n- g1g3: G2 not active → resistance 0%, but data shows 10%. Hmm, conflict here.\n\nWait, given the data for g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant but higher than g2 (0%). That suggests that G1 and G3 are needed for full activation of G2, but even when both are missing, there's some residual G2 activity (10%). So, maybe other factors also contribute to G2's activation. But how does this tie into transcription factors?\n\nAlternatively, G2 is a transcription factor that is necessary for resistance, and G1 and G3 are enhancers of G2. So knocking out G2 completely removes resistance (0%), but G1 and G3 regulate the level of G2 activity. Hence, in single mutants g1 or g3, G2's activity is somewhat reduced. When both G1 and G3 are gone, G2 is barely active (10%). This matches the data.\n\nIf that's the case, then the conclusion would be that G1 and G3 act upstream of G2 and contribute to its function. And G2 is a transcription factor necessary for resistance. The genetic interactions would show that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3 since the double mutants involving G2 and another gene have the same phenotype as G2 alone. The upstream genes (G1, G3) influence the level of G2's activity, but G2 is required for any resistance. Moreover, the interaction between G1 and G3 is additive/synergistic because their combined knockout results in worse resistance than individual.\n\nIn summary, G2 is the key gene (maybe the transcription factor) acting downstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 both contribute to the function of G2, but G2 is essential—without it, no resistance. This matches the data where G2 knockout is 0%, and G1 and G3 knockouts partially reduce resistance.

In summary, G2 is the key gene (maybe the transcription factor) acting downstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 both contribute to the function of G2, but G2 is essential—without it, no resistance. This matches the data where G2 knockout is 0%, and G1 and G3 knockouts partially reduce resistance. Therefore, the conclusion would be that G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3, which modulate its activity.

The experimental data reveal the following genetic interactions and hierarchical relationships among the genes **G1, G2, and G3** in anthracnose resistance:

### Key Observations:
1. **G2 is essential for resistance**:
   - The **g2** single mutant (0% resistance) and **all double mutants involving g2** (g1g2, g2g3: 0% resistance) completely lose resistance. This indicates that **G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3**, acting downstream in the pathway. Resistance **cannot occur without G2**.

2. **Partial redundancy between G1 and G3**:
   - Loss of G1 reduces resistance to 75%, while loss of G3 reduces it to 50%. In the **g1g3 double mutant** (10% resistance), resistance drops further but is not fully abolished. This suggests **G1 and G3 work in parallel pathways upstream of G2**, with partial compensatory roles. 
   - Their individual contributions are additive but not fully overlapping:  
     - G3 accounts for ≈50% of resistance.  
     - G1 accounts for ≈25%.  
     - Together, they still allow residual resistance (10%), indicating some G2 activation remains possible even without G1/G3.

3. **G2 is likely the transcription factor**:
   - Since G2 is epistatic and its loss completely abolishes resistance, it is the critical node for activating downstream defense responses. Given the premise that a transcription factor is involved, **G2 likely acts as a TF** integrating signals from G1/G3 to regulate resistance genes.

---

### Hierarchical Pathway Model:
- **G1 and G3** → **G2 (transcription factor)** → **Resistance pathway activation**.  
  - G1 and G3 act redundantly but non-identically to regulate G2 expression/activity.  
  - G2 is indispensable, as no resistance occurs in its absence.  

### Final Conclusion:
The data support a **partially redundant regulatory hierarchy** where **G1 and G3 act upstream of G2**, with G2 being a transcription factor essential for anthracnose resistance. Disruption of G2 alone (or in combination with G1/G3) eliminates resistance entirely, while loss of G1 or G3 reduces resistance proportionally to their additive contributions.

Additionally, since the double mutants with g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) don't differ from g2 alone, this confirms that G2's function is essential and downstream. The transcription factor mentioned is likely G2, acting downstream of G1 and G3, integrating their signals to confer full resistance.

In summary, the genetic interaction can be depicted as G1 and G3 both upregulating G2, which in turn activates pathways necessary for resistance. The partial effects of G1 and G3 in their mutants indicate they are upstream regulators, while G2's complete loss of function abolishes resistance entirely, marking it as the critical node in the pathway.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

From the experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the interaction between G1, G2, and G3:

1. **G2 is the critical transcription factor** responsible for most of the resistance:
   - The knockout mutant **g2** (0% resistance) shows complete loss of resistance, indicating that *G2 is indispensable* and likely acts downstream of the other genes. Loss of G2 alone is sufficient to abolish resistance entirely, even if G1/G3 are functional. This suggests G2 is the central regulator (transcription factor) driving resistance pathways.

2. **G1 and G3 act upstream of G2** to enhance its function:
   - Single mutants **g1** (75% resistance) and **g3** (50% resistance) retain partial resistance, implying that G1 and G3 contribute to but are not strictly required for G2 activity. Their roles likely involve *activating or amplifying G2* to achieve full resistance (e.g., regulating G2 transcription, modifying its protein, or compensating for partial loss).
   - The *g1g3* double mutant (10% resistance) exhibits significantly reduced resistance compared to either single mutant, suggesting **partial redundancy** between G1 and G3 in their support of G2. Their combined loss severely impairs G2’s residual activity.

3. **Epistatic relationships**:
   - G2 is **epistatic** to both G1 and G3, as all double mutants involving **g2** (g1g2, g2g3) show 0% resistance, matching the g2 single mutant. This confirms that G2’s function is non-redundant and lies downstream in the pathway.

4. **Genetic pathway model**:
   - G1 and G3 function upstream in a **partially redundant pathway** that converges on G2. Their combined activity ensures robust activation of G2. When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2’s residual function is minimal (10%), further supporting their roles as enhancers/facilitators of G2.

**Summary:** 
- G2 is the transcription factor directly responsible for anthracnose resistance. 
- G1 and G3 act redundantly upstream to promote G2’s activity (e.g., increasing its expression/stability). 
- The hierarchy is **G1, G3 → G2**, with G2 being epistatic and essential.

 For G1, the residual activity is 75%, so each gene being active contributes to maintaining resistance. Thus, G1 is 75% → contribution is (1 - 0.75) = 25%? Alternatively, treating resistance log linear? Perhaps better to see additive contributions. Alternatively, think of parallel pathways where G1 and G3 each contribute.

But if G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways that each require G2, then their individual loss would attenuate the pathway, and the double knockout would have a severe effect, hence 10%, which is less than additive (0.75*0.5 = 37.5% is what you see if combining mutations multiplicatively, but here they have 10% which is much lower). This suggests that when both G1 and G3 are missing, their combined effect is more than additive, indicating possible synergistic interaction or buffer each other. Alternatively, there's an additive impact but in a way that crosses thresholds.

Alternatively, suppose G2 is the main gene, and G1 and G3 work upstream to regulate G2. So, if G2 isn't functioning (g2), resistance is 0%. In g1 or g3 mutants, G2 is functioning but maybe at a reduced capacity. So, G1 and G3 either enhance G2's expression or activity.

Suppose in g1, G2's expression is reduced by 25%, hence resistance is 75%. In g3 mutant, G2's expression is halved. In the double g1g3, G2's expression is worse, perhaps exponentially, leading to 10% activity.

Thus, G1 and G3 may both positively regulate G2's expression. G2 is the transcription factor responsible for resistance, and knocking out either G1 or G3 reduces the activation of G2, leading to lower resistance. If both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 is barely active (10% resistance). Therefore, the conclusion is that G1 and G3 are upstream regulators of the transcription factor G2. Mutations in G1 or G3 reduce G2's activation, leading to partial resistance. G2 itself is essential, so when G2 is knocked out, there's no resistance regardless of G1 and G3.

Another check: The epistasic relationships. If g2 (0%) is epistatic to g1 (75%) and g3 (50%), meaning G2 is downstream of both. The combination would be:

If G1 is in a pathway leading to G2, and G3 in a separate but critical pathway, but no.

But if both G1 and G3 lead to G2's activation, then without G1, the level G2 is reduced, leading to lower resistance (75%). If G3 is defective, same in G2's activity leading to 50%. In absence of both, G2's activation is barely there (10%). If G2 itself is absent, then 0%. This seems to fit the data.

Meanwhile, if in double mutants with g2 (g1g2, g2g3) — without G2, it's 0% regardless of G1 or G3, showing that G2 is epistatic. So the hierarchy is G1 and G3 → G2. Therefore, all three genes are part of a pathway where G1 and G3 contribute to the activation of G2. G2 is the transcription factor that is critical for resistance and is acted upon by G1 and G3. So, G1 and G3 regulate G2 in a redundant or additive manner. But since their single mutants don’t completely abolish resistance (they reduce it to 75% or 50%), they each contribute to maintaining G2's function but are not individually essential, which suggests they act in a partially redundant upstream pathway.

To annotate the interaction, hierarchy: G1 and G3 act upstream of G2 (transcription factor) and their products are necessary for full activation of G2. Losing G2 has the most drastic effect, indicating its central role. Combining g1 and g3 would exacerbate the reduction in G2 activation, hence lower resistance than either single mutant. Hence the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3, which both contribute to its activation.
