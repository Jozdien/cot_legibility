To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by noting that the components of \(\vec{P}\) are given by the Pauli matrices scaled by \(\hbar/2\). The operator along the direction \(\vec{n}\) (which lies in the x-z plane) can be written as:

\[
P_n = \sin\theta \cdot P_x + \cos\theta \cdot P_z
\]

Given the Pauli matrices for \(P_x\) and \(P_z\):

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The operator \(P_n\) becomes:

\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). This involves solving the eigenvalue equation:

\[
\left( \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \right) \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

Setting up the equations from the matrix equation:

1. \((\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0\)
2. \(\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0\)

Solving these equations, we find that:

\[
a = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b
\]

Normalizing the eigenvector, we use trigonometric identities to express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(\theta/2\):

\[
\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}}, \quad \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}}
\]

Substituting these into the eigenvector and normalizing, we get the normalized eigenvector:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

Okay, so I have to find the eigenvector of the spin operator for a muon along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator components are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z. Let me see.

First, since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of the direction vector is zero. So, the unit vector n should be in the x-z plane. Let's parametrize it with some angle θ from the z-axis. So, components of n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So, the operator in the direction n is P = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Since P_y isn't involved here because n_y = 0.

Given the matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z. Let me note them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix:
[[0, 1],
 [1, 0]]

P_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix:
[[1, 0],
 [0, -1]]

So the operator along n is P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z

Which would be (ħ/2) times [sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]]

Let's compute that matrix. Multiply through by ħ/2, but maybe we can factor that out. So, let's first compute without the ħ/2 factor:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] =
[[cosθ*1 + 0, sinθ*1 + 0],
 [sinθ*1 +0, cosθ*(-1) +0]]
Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, adding matrices component-wise:

First matrix from sinθ multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]]:
Top left: 0*sinθ
Top right: 1*sinθ
Bottom left: 1*sinθ
Bottom right: 0*sinθ

Second matrix from cosθ multiplied by [[1,0],[0,-1]]:
Top left: 1*cosθ
Top right: 0*cosθ
Bottom left: 0*cosθ
Bottom right: -1*cosθ

Adding them component-wise:

Top left: 0*sinθ + 1*cosθ = cosθ

Top right: 1*sinθ + 0*cosθ = sinθ

Bottom left: 1*sinθ + 0*cosθ = sinθ

Bottom right: 0*sinθ + (-1)cosθ = -cosθ

So the combined matrix is:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Therefore, the operator P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So, the matrix we need to diagonalize is:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ]]

But eigenvectors don't depend on the scalar multiple, so we can ignore the ħ/2 factor since we are looking for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, eigenvalues are related to the operator multiplied by the vector equals the eigenvalue times the vector. So, if we have operator P_n = (ħ/2) * M, where M is [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]

Then, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Which translates to (ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ: M |ψ> = |ψ>

So we need to find the eigenvectors of M corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

Hence, the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of the matrix M with eigenvalue 1.

So construct the matrix M:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Set up the equation (M - I)v = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (M - I):

[[cosθ - 1, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ - 1]]

To find the eigenvector, we need to solve:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0

With (a, b) being the components of the eigenvector.

Let’s write the equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

2. sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

These are two equations, but they should be linearly dependent since the rank of (M - I) should be 1 for a non-trivial solution.

Let me try to express one variable in terms of another. Let's take the first equation.

From equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b

Therefore:

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] b

But note that cosθ - 1 = -2 sin²(θ/2)

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Therefore, rewrite:

a = [ - 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Denominator is -2 sin²(θ/2), numerator is -2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So:

a = [ (-2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ] b = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b = cot(θ/2) b

Hence, a = cot(θ/2) b

So, if we set b = 1, then a = cot(θ/2). But let's check equation 2:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0

Substitute a = cot(θ/2) b:

sinθ * cot(θ/2) b + (- cosθ -1) b = 0

Divide both sides by b (assuming b ≠0):

sinθ cot(θ/2) - cosθ -1 = 0

Simplify sinθ cot(θ/2):

cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)

So sinθ cot(θ/2) = sinθ * cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)

But sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Hence:

sinθ cot(θ/2) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] * [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] = 2 cos²(θ/2)

Therefore, 2 cos²(θ/2) - cosθ -1 =0

Let's compute cosθ. We have the identity cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2) -1

Hence,

2 cos²(θ/2) - (2 cos²(θ/2) -1) -1 =0

Simplify:

2 cos²θ/2 -2cos²θ/2 +1 -1=0 => 0=0, which checks out.

Therefore, the solution is consistent, and our parametrization is correct.

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

v = [ a; b ] = [ cot(θ/2); 1 ]

But need to normalize it.

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cot²(θ/2) +1 = csc²(θ/2) since 1 + cot²x = csc²x.

Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/ sqrt(csc²(θ/2)) )= sin(θ/2)

Therefore, normalized eigenvector is:

[ sin(θ/2) * cot(θ/2); sin(θ/2) *1 ]

But sin(θ/2) cot(θ/2) = sin(θ/2) * [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] = cos(θ/2)

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2); sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, that's a standard result for spin-1/2 systems. When we have a spin-1/2 state in the direction (θ, φ), the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]. Since in this case, the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0 or π. Given that it's an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, but specified as a unit vector with positive components? Wait, maybe phi is zero. Hmm.

But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so x and z components. Phi is the azimuthal angle. If the direction is (θ, φ=0) in spherical coordinates, then the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Alternatively, checking with theta as polar angle from z-axis, then yes.

But let me check again with components.

Wait our initial vector has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ). If we consider θ as the polar angle from the z-axis, then yes.

Hence the eigenvector for spin in direction (sinθ,0,cosθ) is cos(θ/2)|+> + sin(θ/2)|->, where |+> is up along z, and |-> is down along z. Since the standard result is that the eigenvector for spin in direction (θ, φ) is [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)].

In this case, since φ=0 (since it's in x-z plane, azimuthal angle is 0), so the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Conversely, had we parameterized with φ instead, but here it's simpler.

Therefore, is that consistent with our earlier calculation?

Yes. Because the parametrization we had:

[ a; b ] after normalization is [ cosθ/2; sinθ/2 ] . That's correct.

But let's double-check. Let's take θ =0: the direction is along +z, the eigenvector should be [1; 0]. So cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. Good. Similarly, theta = pi: the direction is along -z, and the eigenvector should be [0;1]. Cos(pi/2) =0, sin(pi/2)=1. So that's correct.

If theta=pi/2: the direction is along +x. Then eigenvector is [cos(pi/4); sin(pi/4)] = [sqrt(2)/2; sqrt(2)/2], which is the eigenvector for spin up along x, which is indeed the case when you diagonalize sigma_x.

But sigma_x has eigenvectors [1;1] and [1;-1], normalized to 1/sqrt(2). So that checks.

Therefore, answer is normalized eigenvector [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]. But in terms of the matrices given, which uses the z basis, this is correct.

But in the problem statement, they asked for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Since the direction is arbitrary, maybe it's in terms of theta, or perhaps expression in terms of the components of n. However, the question didn't specify θ but mentions an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. The unit vector n is (n_x, 0, n_z) with n_x^2 + n_z^2=1. But n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, if θ is the angle from z-axis, so the answer can be written in terms of n_x and n_z.

Therefore, maybe expressing cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) in terms of n_z and n_x.

Since n_z = cosθ and n_x = sinθ. Let's try that.

cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Similarly, sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But since theta is measured from the z-axis, so cos(theta/2) can also be related to n_x and n_z, but would involve square roots. Alternatively, we might write cos(theta/2) (upper component) and sin(theta/2) (lower component) in the vector. But maybe the answer is written in terms of theta.

But the question says "along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane", and asked for "the elements of the normalized eigenvector". It doesn't specify variables, so maybe need to write it in terms of the components of n. Wait, n is a direction (unit vector) in x-z plane. So n=(n_x,0,n_z), n_x=sinθ, n_z=cosθ. Then perhaps we can express the eigenvector as [sqrt((1 +n_z)/2), sqrt((1 -n_z)/2)]?

Let me check for theta. With theta from the z-axis, n_z=cosθ, so [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Expressed in terms of n_z, cos(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Sin(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Hence, the eigenvector is [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But is there a way to write this with possible trigonometric identities or anything else?

Alternatively, if spin is along direction n, theta is the polar angle from z, so the components can be expressed as:

[ cos(theta/2); e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But here phi=0, so the plus component.

Alternatively, if we want to make it in terms of n_x and n_z, we can note that:

n_x = sin theta

n_z = cos theta

So theta = arctan(n_x /n_z)

But sqrt( (1+n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) would be better. For example:

The first element is sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), second element is sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But it's also possible that the vector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] written in terms of trigonometric functions of theta. However, the problem doesn't specify theta, only specifying the direction n in the x-z plane. So, it's best to express the components in terms of n_x and n_z since n is arbitrary. However, since in calculation, theta is the angle from z-axis, so n_z = cos theta and n_x = sin theta. So to write the components in terms of n_x and n_z:

Since n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta.

We can find expressions for cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) in terms of n_x and n_z:

We know that cos(theta) = n_z, so using double-angle formulas:

cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos theta)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But n_x = sin theta, and sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). Therefore, sin(theta) = n_x = 2 sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) = sqrt(1 -n_z^2) but n_x = sin theta = sqrt(1 -n_z^2). Correct. So yes, substituting:

So converting out eigenvectors components to n_x and n_z:

Aha but we should check if this also holds for directional aspects.

Alternatively, we can keep the eigenvector as [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)], but since the problem states the direction is arbitrary along n, and n is given in the x-z plane, whose components would be functions of theta, which an examinee can use. But the answer would then need to be in terms of theta?

But re-reading the problem, it's asked to calculate eigenvector for operator P along an arbitrary direction n… So the answer should probably be expressed algebraically in terms of theta. But the problem mentions the direction is arbitrary, and while components (matrices) for x,y,z are given. However, the answer expects the general form. Wait the title says "2 by 2 square matrix having elements in the first row..." wait, no, other parts. Hmm.

Wait the operator is given as:

P_x is ħ/2 * Pauli X matrix,

Same with P_y and P_z as ħ/2 times the corresponding Pauli matrices.

But the question just asks for the eigenvector in that operator, as "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So maybe not numerical, but in terms of trigonometric functions?

In my earlier reasoning, the eigenvector has components [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is normalized since cosine squared plus sine squared is 1. So for example, if theta is some angle. But maybe the question gives us the standard result and just wants that form. But need to check through the operator definition.

Alternatively, perhaps if you take n as a unit vector (sinθ, 0, cosθ), the spin operator in direction n is n·P, with P being the vector (P_x, P_y, P_z). So as we did before, the matrix is [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]] times ħ/2. The eigenvalue equation then requires eigenvector |ψ> satisfies that matrix applied to |ψ> equals |ψ>.

We found the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] after normalization.

Alternatively, in another arrangement, some sources represent the eigenvector as a two-component spinor, which in this case can indeed be represented as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But just to write that again. The eigenvector for +ħ/2 in the direction n (x-z plane) is a normalized two-component vector with elements cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between n and the z-axis.

Hence, since the problem doesn't specify a numerical angle but rather an arbitrary direction, the answer is expressed in terms of theta.

Alternatively, if they want it parameterized in terms of n, then:

For the direction vector n=(n_x, 0, n_z) where n_x^2 + n_z^2=1, then as earlier:

cos(theta/2)=sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), and sin(theta/2)=sqrt((1 - n_z)/2 )

so the spinor is [sqrt((1 +n_z)/2), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )]

But we can note that sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) is cos(theta/2), as before.

Alternatively, if we write in terms of n_x:

n_x = sin theta, so sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) = sin(theta/2). Is there a way to write sqrt((1 - n_z)/2 ) in terms of n_x and n_z? Not sure if necessary.

But the problem just wants the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So given that he must have normalized the eigenvector and that the elements are likely written in terms of theta as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] likely after simplifying.

Alternatively, maybe he should write them using the original Pauli matrices given. Wait, the only variables in the answer would relate to the direction n. Since direction n is set by theta in x-z plane, so theta controls the ratio of x and z components.

But the spinor components themselves in terms of theta being [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] can be given. That representation is standard.

Alternatively, let's confirm by taking a test angle:

Suppose theta = 90 degrees, pointing along x-axis. Then theta/2=45, cos(theta/2)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(theta/2)=sqrt(2)/2. Then eigenvector is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], as we saw earlier. And the corresponding matrix P_n would be (ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] (since theta=90, cos theta=0, sin theta=1). Solving eigenvalues for [[0,1],[1,0]], the eigenvalues +1 and -1. The eigenvector for +1 is [1,1]/sqrt(2). Which is equal to [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)]. Correct. So that works.

Another test case, say theta=180, pointing negative z. Then eigenvector should be [cos(90), sin(90)] = [0,1], which points down along z. However, the operator in the direction of n pointing along -z would be -sigma_z. So for sigma_z eigenvalue +1, the state would be [1,0], but here if we point along -z, we have -sigma_z. The eigenvector for +1 would be [0,1]. Correct.

Hence confirms our eigenvector formula is correct.

Therefore, returning to the problem, the answer is the normalized eigenvector with elements cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), written as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. But to box them properly, need to perhaps use some notation.

Alternatively, given in terms of components from trigonometric functions.

Since the problem is just saying n is arbitrary in x-z plane, maybe answers with cos and sin functions of angle theta between n and z-axis are exceptable. The existing answer in the Pauli spin case is just that.

Alternatively, if written in terms of the components of n, as [sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ].

But n_z = cos(theta), hence either way. Unless the problem wants components of the eigenvector expressed using theta as defined by the angle in n. Given the problem states "lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Given the components...". So there is a likelihood the answer should be written as a function of theta with the spinor components.

But actually, going back to the user prompt: the user says

"Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane...What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"

So, likely, to write the standard result for spin-1/2 systems, which is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], theta being the angle between n and the z-axis in the x-z plane. However, if theta is from x-axis, the components would be different, but user specifies that n is in x-z plane, so might need further clarification. But standard definition is from z-axis.

Alternatively, since the problem states "arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". Therefore, user may prefer the answer in terms of n_x and n_z.

But probably wants it in terms of θ, the angle from z-axis. Although how is θ defined in the problem? The problem doesn't define any angle, only an arbitrary direction n. If the user does not allow extraneous variables, possibly want it expressed using components n_x and n_z. I think that may be.

Wait. let's see.

Wait the direction vector is n = (n_x, 0, n_z) with n_x^2 +n_z^2=1.

since the operator is along n, that is say is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

We can write P_n = (ħ/2)[n_x * sigma_x + n_z * sigma_z]

Similarly, our deduction was that eigenvector is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)] but theta, which is the angle between n and the z-axis. So,

But n_x = sin(theta), n_z=cos(theta). So, we can substitute theta accordingly in terms of n_x and n_z. For example, from:

sin(theta) =n_x,

but cos(theta/2) =sqrt( (1 + cos(theta))/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Similarly sin(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 -cos(theta) ) /2 )=sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Therefore, in terms of n_z. Since the direction n in the x-z plane has to be such that n_x= sin(theta), n_z=cos(theta). But we can express theta via n_z.

Hence, the elements of the eigenvector can be written using functions of n_z. And since we need the eigenvector for an arbitrary direction, the answer is written in terms of the components of n, i.e., as [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But then, if definite answer is needed, does the problem state to write in terms of n_x and/or n_z, or is it to leave it in terms of theta.

But despite being called an arbitrary direction, the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n". So, giving the eigenvector in terms of components of n.

Given that I've tested it with special cases, and it works, I think the answer is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] as functions from the angle theta (angle from the z-axis). But the problem didn't define theta, so perhaps another way.

Wait, let me check the start of the problem again.

"Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ℏ/2. Given the X−component, P_x of the operator P as ℏ/2 times a 2 by 2 square matrix... The Y−component, P_y... Finally, the Z−component, P_z... What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"

So theta is implicitly defined by the direction n. But it 's not given numerically. So citing in terms of theta (the polar angle from z-axis) is standard. If they want an answer in  terms of theta, boxed.

Alternatively, in question, even though the direction is arbitrary, the answer requires using specific eigenvectors in terms of known angles. Or could the answer have square roots involving 1 ± n_z terms?

But in many quantum mechanics contexts, writing the eigenvector for spin-1/2 in direction (theta) is standard as [cos(theta/2); e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]. Since here phi=0, [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]

unless there's a phase factor.

But as per no magnetic field, phi=0 here (since the vector is in x-z plane). so absence of phi.

Therefore, I think the answer is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. Therefore, in boxed notation, the elements are these.

However, let me recapitulate all steps once again to make sure I don't have any mistake.

We found operator in direction n (x-z plane):

(ħ/2)[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]

Then, eigenvalues = (ħ/2)* eigenvalues of [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

eigenvalues of this matrix given by det(Matrix - λI)=0:

=> |cosθ - λ, sinθ |
   |sinθ, -cosθ - λ |

So determinant = (cosθ -λ)(-cosθ -λ) - sin^2θ = -cos^2θ -λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ^2 - sin²θ = λ^2 - cos^2θ - sin²θ = λ^2 -1=0, because cos²θ + sin²θ=1.

Hence λ^2 -1=0 => λ=±1. So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2.

Therefore we need the eigenvector corresponding to λ=+1 (since the user requested +ħ/2, When the operator is multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalue is (ħ/2)*1=ħ/2).

Therefore, eigenvectors for λ=1:

Find vector [a;b] s.t. 

( [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]] - I ) [a;b] =0

Matrix:

[[cosθ -1, sinθ],
 [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1]]

From first row: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0

Consider standard solution:

We can set a= N*sinθ

so relation:

(cosθ-1) N sinθ + sinθ *b=0

=> b= -(cosθ -1)N

But depending on how normalizable, perhaps better start as earlier.

Alternatively, note from θ approaches 0, eigenvectors should approach [1,0]

But in the previous steps, when a =cos(theta/2), b= sin(theta/2). Let theta go to zero: cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0. Hence [1,0]. Correct.

If theta=pi, approaching -z direction, then cos(pi/2) =0, sin(pi/2]=1, eigenvector [0,1]. Correct. Because sigma_z with eigenvalue -1.

Thereforee to normalise, the answer is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]

So definitively, writing the vector as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] with theta being the angle between direction n and the positive z-axis, and phi=0. Hence, correct.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:



**Final Answer**
The normalized eigenvector is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}.

Okay, so I have to find the eigenvector of the spin operator for a muon along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +ħ/2. The operator components are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z. Let me see.

First, since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of the direction vector is zero. So, the unit vector n should be in the x-z plane. Let's parametrize it with some angle θ from the z-axis. So, components of n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So, the operator in the direction n is P = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Since P_y isn't involved here because n_y = 0.

Given the matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z. Let me note them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix:
[[0, 1],
 [1, 0]]

P_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix:
[[1, 0],
 [0, -1]]

So the operator along n is P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z

Which would be (ħ/2) times [sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]]

Let's compute that matrix. Multiply through by ħ/2, but maybe we can factor that out. So, let's first compute without the ħ/2 factor:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] =
[[cosθ*1 + 0, sinθ*1 + 0],
 [sinθ*1 +0, cosθ*(-1) +0]]
Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, adding matrices component-wise:

First matrix from sinθ multiplied by [[0,1],[1,0]]:
Top left: 0*sinθ
Top right: 1*sinθ
Bottom left: 1*sinθ
Bottom right: 0*sinθ

Second matrix from cosθ multiplied by [[1,0],[0,-1]]:
Top left: 1*cosθ
Top right: 0*cosθ
Bottom left: 0*cosθ
Bottom right: -1*cosθ

Adding them component-wise:

Top left: 0*sinθ + 1*cosθ = cosθ

Top right: 1*sinθ + 0*cosθ = sinθ

Bottom left: 1*sinθ + 0*cosθ = sinθ

Bottom right: 0*sinθ + (-1)cosθ = -cosθ

So the combined matrix is:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Therefore, the operator P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix. So, the matrix we need to diagonalize is:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ]]

But eigenvectors don't depend on the scalar multiple, so we can ignore the ħ/2 factor since we are looking for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, eigenvalues are related to the operator multiplied by the vector equals the eigenvalue times the vector. So, if we have operator P_n = (ħ/2) * M, where M is [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]]

Then, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Which translates to (ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ: M |ψ> = |ψ>

So we need to find the eigenvectors of M corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

Hence, the problem reduces to finding the eigenvector of the matrix M with eigenvalue 1.

So construct the matrix M:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Set up the equation (M - I)v = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (M - I):

[[cosθ - 1, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ - 1]]

To find the eigenvector, we need to solve:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0

With (a, b) being the components of the eigenvector.

Let’s write the equations:

1. (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0

2. sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

These are two equations, but they should be linearly dependent since the rank of (M - I) should be 1 for a non-trivial solution.

Let me try to express one variable in terms of another. Let's take the first equation.

From equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b

Therefore:

a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) ] b

But note that cosθ - 1 = -2 sin²(θ/2)

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Therefore, rewrite:

a = [ - 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ] b

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Denominator is -2 sin²(θ/2), numerator is -2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So:

a = [ (-2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) / (-2 sin²(θ/2)) ] b = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] b = cot(θ/2) b

Hence, a = cot(θ/2) b

So, if we set b = 1, then a = cot(θ/2). But let's check equation 2:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0

Substitute a = cot(θ/2) b:

sinθ * cot(θ/2) b + (- cosθ -1) b = 0

Divide both sides by b (assuming b ≠0):

sinθ cot(θ/2) - cosθ -1 = 0

Simplify sinθ cot(θ/2):

cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)

So sinθ cot(θ/2) = sinθ * cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)

But sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Hence:

sinθ cot(θ/2) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] * [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] = 2 cos²(θ/2)

Therefore, 2 cos²(θ/2) - cosθ -1 =0

Let's compute cosθ. We have the identity cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2) -1

Hence,

2 cos²(θ/2) - (2 cos²(θ/2) -1) -1 =0

Simplify:

2 cos²θ/2 -2cos²θ/2 +1 -1=0 => 0=0, which checks out.

Therefore, the solution is consistent, and our parametrization is correct.

Therefore, the eigenvector can be written as:

v = [ a; b ] = [ cot(θ/2); 1 ]

But need to normalize it.

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = cot²(θ/2) +1 = csc²(θ/2) since 1 + cot²x = csc²x.

Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/ sqrt(csc²(θ/2)) )= sin(θ/2)

Therefore, normalized eigenvector is:

[ sin(θ/2) * cot(θ/2); sin(θ/2) *1 ]

But sin(θ/2) cot(θ/2) = sin(θ/2) * [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] = cos(θ/2)

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2); sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, that's a standard result for spin-1/2 systems. When we have a spin-1/2 state in the direction (θ, φ), the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]. Since in this case, the direction is in the x-z plane, φ=0 or π. Given that it's an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, but specified as a unit vector with positive components? Wait, maybe phi is zero. Hmm.

But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so x and z components. Phi is the azimuthal angle. If the direction is (θ, φ=0) in spherical coordinates, then the eigenvector is [

I need to determine the eigenvector of the spin operator for a muon along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +ħ/2. The spin operator components are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z.

Since the direction lies in the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector is zero. I'll parametrize the unit vector n with angle θ from the z-axis, giving components (sinθ, 0, cosθ). The operator in direction n is therefore P = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ, as P_y doesn't contribute because n_y = 0.

The matrices for the spin operators are:
P_x = (ħ/2)[[0, 1], [1, 0]] (Pauli X matrix)
P_y = (ħ/2)[[0, -i], [i, 0]] (Pauli Y matrix)
P_z = (ħ/2)[[1, 0], [0, -1]] (Pauli Z matrix)

So P_n = sinθ × P_x + cosθ × P_z

Computing this matrix without the ħ/2 factor first:
sinθ × [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ × [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding these matrices component-wise:
Top left: 0×sinθ + 1×cosθ = cosθ
Top right: 1×sinθ + 0×cosθ = sinθ
Bottom left: 1×sinθ + 0×cosθ = sinθ
Bottom right: 0×sinθ + (-1)×cosθ = -cosθ

The resulting matrix M is:
[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Therefore, P_n = (ħ/2) × M

Since we're looking for eigenvectors with eigenvalue +ħ/2, the equation becomes:
P_n |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) |ψ⟩
(ħ/2) × M |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) |ψ⟩
M |ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩

So I need to find eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1.

Setting up (M - I)v = 0:
[[cosθ - 1, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ - 1]] [a, b]^T = [0, 0]^T

This gives the equations:
1. (cosθ - 1)a + sinθb = 0
2. sinθa + (-cosθ - 1)b = 0

From equation 1:
a = [-sinθ/(cosθ - 1)]b

Using the identities cosθ - 1 = -2sin²(θ/2) and sinθ = 2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2):
a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)]b = cot(θ/2)b

Setting b = 1 gives a = cot(θ/2).

Checking this solution in equation 2:
sinθ×cot(θ/2) + (-cosθ - 1) = 0

Simplifying sinθ×cot(θ/2):
= 2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)×[cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)]
= 2cos²(θ/2)

And since cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2) - 1:
2cos²(θ/2) - (2cos²(θ/2) - 1) - 1 = 0
0 = 0 ✓

Therefore, the eigenvector is v = [cot(θ/2), 1]^T

Normalizing the eigenvector:
|v|² = cot²(θ/2) + 1 = csc²(θ/2)
Normalization factor = sin(θ/2)

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I've got to determine the eigenvector of the spin operator for a muon along an unspecified direction in the x-z plane, with an associated eigenvalue of +ħ/2. The operator's components are represented as P_x, P_y, and P_z.

First, given that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector is zero. Thus, the unit vector n lies in the x-z plane, which we can express parametrically using an angle θ from the z-axis. Therefore, the components of n are (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since in the x-z plane, the y-component remains zero. This makes the operator along direction n as P = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ, excluding P_y since n_y = 0.

Now, considering the matrices:

P_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix:
[[0, 1],
 [1, 0]]

P_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix:
[[1, 0],
 [0, -1]]

So, the operator aligned with n, P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z, equals (ħ/2) times [sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]].

Let's compute the matrix. Factor (ħ/2) out and first compute without the ħ/2:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] results in:
[[cosθ + 0, sinθ + 0],
 [sinθ + 0, -cosθ + 0]]

Adding matrices component-wise yields:

Top left: 0*sinθ + 1*cosθ = cosθ
Top right: 1*sinθ + 0*cosθ = sinθ
Bottom left: 1*sinθ + 0*cosθ = sinθ
Bottom right: 0*sinθ - cosθ = -cosθ

Thus, the matrix becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Therefore, the operator P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix. It's necessary to diagonalize the matrix:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],
         [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Since eigenvectors are unaffected by scalar multiples, we can disregard the ħ/2 factor while seeking eigenvalue +ħ/2. Eigenvalues relate to the operator times the vector equating to the eigenvalue times the vector. If our operator P_n = (ħ/2) * M, where M is [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]], then:

P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

This translates to (ħ/2) M |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Multiplying both sides by 2/ħ gives: M |ψ> = |ψ>.

Now, to find the eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1:

Construct matrix M:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Set up the equation (M - I)v = 0, where I is the identity matrix. (M - I) is:

[[cosθ - 1, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ - 1]]

To find the eigenvector, solve:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0

Let’s solve these equations.

From equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ b

Therefore:

a = [- sinθ / (cosθ - 1)] b

Note that cosθ - 1 = -2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). Rewrite:

a = [- 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (-2 sin²(θ/2))] b

Simplify:

a = [cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2)] b = cot(θ/2) b

Hence, if b = 1, then a = cot(θ/2). Verify with equation 2:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0

Substituting a = cot(θ/2) b:

sinθ * cot(θ/2) b + (- cosθ -1) b = 0

Dividing by b:

sinθ cot(θ/2) - cosθ -1 = 0

Given that cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2) leads to sinθ cot(θ/2) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] * [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] = 2 cos²(θ/2)

Therefore, 2 cos²(θ/2) - cosθ -1 =0 equates to:

2 cos²θ/2 -2cos²θ/2 +1 -1=0 => 0=0, verifying the solution's consistency.

Thus, the eigenvector is:

v = [a; b] = [cot(θ/2); 1]

Normalize it:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = cot²(θ/2) +1 = csc²(θ/2)

Normalization factor: 1/sqrt(csc²(θ/2)) = sin(θ/2)

Normalized eigenvector:

[sin(θ/2) * cot(θ/2); sin(θ/2)] = [cos(θ/2); sin(θ/2)]

This aligns with the standard result for spin-1/2 systems when a spin-1/2 state is along the direction (θ, φ), the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]. Here, the direction lies in the x-z plane where φ=0 or π, implying the azimuthal angle φ is zero.

Earlier, we found that a = cot(theta/2) * b. Then, after normalization, we get components [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]\n\nWait, let\'s see. Let me verify calculation again:\n\nLet me assume b = sin(theta/2) , then a = cot(theta/2)*b = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2). Then, the vector is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)], which has norm sqrt( cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) = 1. Therefore, yes, [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)] is already normalized.\n\nSo that must be our normalized eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, when we said the vector is [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2); 1 ] and normalized to [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]\n\nTherefore, seems like that is the normalized eigenvector. Let me check if with this vector, when multiplied by the matrix M, we get the eigenvalue 1.\n\nLet\'s verify:\n\nM = [[cosθ, sinθ],\n     [sinθ, -cosθ]]\n\nVector v = [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]\n\nCompute M*v:\n\nFirst component: cosθ * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2)\nSecond component: sinθ * cos(theta/2) - cosθ * sin(theta/2)\n\nCompute first component:\n\ncosθ cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2) = cos(θ - theta/2) = cos(theta/2) (Using cosine addition formula: cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So here, A = theta, B = theta/2, so cos(theta - theta/2) = cos(theta/2))\n\nSecond component:\n\nsinθ cos(theta/2) - cosθ sin(theta/2) = sin(theta - theta/2) = sin(theta/2)\n\nTherefore, M*v = [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ] = 1 * v. Thus, indeed, eigenvalue 1.\n\nTherefore, this works. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]\n\nWait, but theta is the angle of the direction vector n from the z-axis in the x-z plane. But to write the components, is that sufficient?\n\nAlternatively, since the direction vector n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So theta is the polar angle.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is as above. Therefore, independent of the parameter theta, we can write the components.\n\nWait, but wait the question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Wait, without theta? But the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane. So maybe they just want it expressed in terms of theta?\n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the coordinates can be expressed in terms of sine and cosine of theta/2 as above.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the Bloch sphere representation, where the spin-up direction in the n direction has the components [cos(theta/2); e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]. Since in our case phi = 0 because the direction is in x-z plane, so phi is zero.\n\nHence, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)], which matches our result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a normalized eigenvector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. So, converting to the standard basis. Therefore, the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).\n\nBut maybe we need to express theta in terms of the direction vector. Because the problem states the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So unless they want a parametric answer in terms of the components of n, or they need it symbolically as functions of theta.\n\nBut perhaps another approach. Let me explore.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s parameterize the arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Let’s say n = (a, 0, b) where a² + b² =1. Then, a = sinθ, b = cosθ, so theta is the angle from z-axis.\n\nThen, as above, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]= [sqrt( (1 + b)/2 ), sign(a) sqrt( (1 - b)/2 ) ].\n\nBut since it\'s in the x-z plane, and a=sinθ is positive if theta is between 0 and pi. Depending on the direction. But perhaps to express in terms of a and b, we can write:\n\nIf n = (a, 0, b), then theta is the angle such that a = sinθ, b=cosθ. Therefore, theta/2 would be such that cos(theta/2) = sqrt((1 + cosθ)/2) = sqrt((1 + b)/2) and sin(theta/2) = sqrt((1 - cosθ)/2) = sqrt((1 - b)/2). But sign? Well, theta is between 0 and pi, so theta/2 is between 0 and pi/2, so both sin and cos are positive. However, a = sintheta, so depending on theta, a is positive, so sin(theta/2) would be positive. Therefore, we can write the eigenvector components as [ sqrt( (1 + b)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - b)/2 ) ].\n\nBut in our earlier calculation, it\'s [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] which can be rewritten in terms of b and a.\n\nSince cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + b)/2 ), sintheta/2 = sqrt( (1 - b)/2 )\n\nAlternatively, since a = sin theta, then sintheta = a = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). But perhaps that complicates more.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says "for a muon along an arbitrary direction," but since the components of the eigenvector must be expressed in terms that direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants a general expression in terms of theta, which is in the x-z plane. Therefore, the answer is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. Since it\'s written in terms of theta, which parametrizes the direction.\n\nBut the problem might expect the eigenvector for the spin operator along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane as a general case. So without parametrizing theta, maybe it\'s needed to write the components in terms of sin(theta) and cos(theta), but seems like theta is the parameter here. Hmmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to just express it in terms of theta, since theta is arbitrary. Therefore, theta defines the direction, so the answer is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)].\n\nBut wait, let me look back at the question.\n\nThe problem says, "Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator vec{P} for a muon along an arbitrary direction vec{n} lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ℏ/2."\n\nThen, the components of the operator are given. Then, it asks "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"\n\nSo the answer must be in terms of components as a column vector. But since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, but to express in terms of theta. Wait, but they probably want a symbolic answer, perhaps expressed in terms of the angle theta. Since they refer to "an arbitrary direction".\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is:\n\ncos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2)\n\nHence, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let\'s verify again with a specific example. Suppose theta=0, i.e., direction along the z-axis. Then eigenvector should be [1, 0]^T for spin-up in z. Our formula gives cos(0) = 1 and sin(0)=0. Correct. Theta = pi: direction along -z. Then theta/2=pi/2. So cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1. So eigenvector [0;1], which is spin-down in z. Wait, but if the direction is along -z, then the eigenvalue would be -ħ/2. But wait a second. Wait, if theta is pi, then the direction n is along -z.\n\nWait, theta is the angle from the z-axis. So theta=0 is +z, theta=pi is -z.\n\nBut when theta=pi, operator P_n becomes:\n\nP_n = sin(pi)P_x + cos(pi) P_z = 0*P_x + (-1) P_z = -P_z.\n\nThe eigenvalues of -P_z are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2 for operator -P_z would be the -z eigenstate for P_z. Because P_z |+z> = ħ/2 |+z>, so -P_z |+z> = -ħ/2 |+z>, thus eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2 for -P_z is |−z> which is [0,1]^T. Which in our formula, when theta=pi, cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1, so vector [0;1]. Exactly. So that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, if we take theta=pi/2, direction along +x. So theta=pi/2. The eigenvector should be cos(pi/4)=√2/2 and sin(pi/4)=√2/2, so [ √2/2 ; √2/2 ] which is the eigenstate of spin in +x direction. Let\'s verify. Operator P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenvectors for +ħ/2 are [1,1]^T normalized to 1/sqrt(2). Exactly. So also, our formula gives [cos(pi/4); sin(pi/4)] = [√2/2, √2/2].\n\nTherefore, this formula correctly gives the eigenvectors for different theta.\n\nHence, the normalized eigenvector elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the answer should be:\n\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), where θ is the angle between the arbitrary direction in the x-z plane and the z-axis.\n\nBut the problem doesn\'t specify any parametrization. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". The problem may want the answer expressed in terms of θ without needing to mention θ? Wait, but we need θ to denote the direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect the expression in terms of unit vector components. Since n is in the x-z plane. Suppose we let the components of n be (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² =1.\n\nThen, can we write the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z?\n\nGiven that n_x=sinθ, n_z=cosθ. Therefore, theta = angle from z-axis, so θ = arctan( n_x / n_z )\n\nHence, theta/2 = 1/2 arctan( n_x / n_z )\n\nHmm, but expressing cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) in terms of n_x and n_z.\n\nAlternatively, using the identity:\n\ncos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nSimilarly, sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nBut to check: since n_x = sinθ, let me confirm:\n\ncos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nsin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nBut since theta is in [0, pi], theta/2 is in [0, pi/2], so both cosine and sine are positive.\n\nBut note that n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )\n\nSo sin(theta/2) = n_x / (2 cos(theta/2 )) = n_x / (2 sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )) = n_x / (sqrt(2 (1 + n_z)) )\n\nBut maybe messy, so perhaps it\'s better expressed as:\n\n[n_z +1 , n_x ] or so, but let me think.\n\nAlternatively, if we use the direction vector n = (n_x, 0, n_z), the eigenvectors can be written as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut without considering the sign, but since n is in the x-z plane, n_x is positive (assuming direction is in positive x-z). If not, theta can be greater than pi, but keeping n_z between -1 and 1. However, if the direction is arbitrary, perhaps you just need to give it in terms of components.\n\nBut n_x and n_z must satisfy n_x² + n_z²=1. Hence, cos(theta/2 )= sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sintheta/2= sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ), and because n_x = sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)\n\nThus, combining those,\n\nsin(theta/2) = n_x / (2 cos(theta/2 )) => n_x = 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )\n\nAlternatively, to make everything in terms of n_x and n_z, but maybe complicates.\n\nAlternatively, if the direction is given parametrically via theta, then keeping the answer as [ cos(theta/2 ), sintheta/2 ] is acceptable.\n\nSince the problem states "arbitrary direction", and eigenvectors depend on that direction (theta), so in terms of theta.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a general answer, regardless of theta, but the question says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"\n\nSince eigenvectors depend on the direction, so perhaps the answer needs to include theta.\n\nTherefore, to sum up, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]\n\nexpresses as:\n\nFirst component: cos(theta/2)\n\nSecond component: sin(theta/2)\n\nTherefore, the elements are cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 )\n\nBut since the problem didn\'t specify variables and says "lying in the x-z plane", perhaps given that, sin theta and cos theta as per the direction. But theta is defined from the z-axis.\n\nAlternatively, the question itself didn\'t mention theta. Wait, actually, the problem didn\'t mention theta at all, except for me parametrizing it. The problem states "arbitrary direction vec{n} lying in the x-z plane", then gives the components of operators. So direction vector n=(n_x, 0, n_z) with n_x² + n_z²=1.\n\nTherefore, perhaps answer in terms of n_x and n_z:\n\nBut as we saw, cos(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sin(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ). But how to write in terms of n_x?\n\nSince theta is determined by n_z = cos theta, so n_x = sin theta.\n\nThen, theta/2 can be defined, but I can multiply and divide by sqrt(2(1 + n_z)) }\n\nAlternatively, use:\n\nsqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) ± sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nBut doesn\'t seem necessary. Alternatively, express as [sqrt(1 + n_z), sqrt(1 - n_z) ] divided by sqrt(2), but if we write sqrt((1 + n_z)/2 ) as sqrt(1 + n_z)/sqrt(2).\n\nAlternatively, to write as (1 + n_z)/sqrt(2(1 + n_z)) ). Wait, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since n_x = sin theta, which is sqrt(1 -n_z² ). So maybe express the eigenvector elements in terms of n_z:\n\nBut it\'s complicated.\n\nAlternatively, there is a parametrization:\n\n[ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nBut given that n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta, how would that look.\n\nLet me relate theta/2 approach. The problem is the answer requires elements expressed whether in terms of some variable or just the answer. Since they mentioned the direction is arbitrary, yet we might need to express it generally, but the problem is presented without given theta or variables; the matrix components need to be defined in terms of the direction vector. But perhaps the problem expects a general answer like [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] as theta is defined from the z-axis in the x-z plane. Since this is conventional. So unless it\'s intended to just present those terms.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n|ψ> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T\n\nTherefore, written as the elements,\n\n- First element: cos(theta/2)\n\n- Second element: sin(theta/2)\n\nTherefore, boxed as:\n\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\\\ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n\nBut theta is angle from z-axis in x-z plane, yes.\n\nAlternatively, if written using the direction vector n, it is:\n\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n\nBut given n lies in x-z plane, so ny=0, and n_x = sin theta and n_z = cos theta. So substituting, gives:\n\nsqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )\n\nsqrt( (1 - cos theta)/2 ) = sin(theta/2 )\n\nTherefore, if we use polar coordinates.\n\nSo the answer would be either in terms of theta or in terms of n_z and n_x. Probably since the question introduces the direction vector n, they might expect the answer in terms of n.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the problem says "along an arbitrary direction vec{n} lying in the x-z plane". So maybe it\'s more appropriate to express the eigenvector components in terms of the components of vector n. So strictly, n is given. So::\n\nLet me note n = (nx, 0, nz) with nx² + nz²=1. Then we need to write the eigenvector elements in terms of nx and nz.\n\nFrom theta parametrization,\n\ncos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 ) and sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - nz)/2 )\n\nBut since nx = sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)\n\nLet’s verify.\n\nIf we write the components as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ) , sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ) ]\n\nThen notice that:\n\nsin theta = nx = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )\n\nBut in terms of nz:\n\nnz = cos theta = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1 ⇒ 2 cos²(theta/2) =1 +nz ⇒ cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 )\n\nand sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 )\n\nThen,\n\nnx = sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ) = 2*sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 )*sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ) = 2*sqrt( (1 -nz)(1 +nz)/4 ))= 2*(sqrt(1 -nz²))/2)= sqrt(1 -nz² )\n\nWhich matches our since nx = sin theta = sqrt(1 - cos² theta)=sqrt(1 - nz² )\n\nBut yes, conforming. Therefore, the components could be written in terms of nz as [sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ) ]^T\n\nHowever, nx= sqrt(1 -nz² ). So perhaps write sin(theta/2 ) in terms of nx and nz. According to sin(theta/2 )=sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ), but we must note sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ), perhaps.  Either way.\n\nBut the problem is that if answer expected is in terms of the components of n they might expect expressed as [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ].\n\nWait, but using trigonometric identities, sin(theta/2) can also be expressed in terms of nx.\n\nWe have:\n\nnx = sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )\n\nSo we have:\n\nsin(theta/2 ) = nx / (2 cos(theta/2 )) = nx / (2*sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 )) = nx / sqrt(2(1 +nz))\n\nBut in theory, sin(theta/2) can be written in terms of nx and nz. But then:\n\nTotal vector would be:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ), nx / sqrt(2(1 +nz)) ]\n\nBut in this case, they both depend on nz and nx.\n\nBut likely it\'s redundant, since expressing it via nz is sufficient as in the earlier form.\n\nAlternatively, noting that in the x-z plane, direction n is (nx, 0, nz), so we can construct the eigenvector as:\n\n|ψ> = [ sqrt((1 +nz)/2 ), (nx / sqrt(2(1 +nz))) ]\n\nBut this is also valid. Simplifying via substitution:\n\nsqrt((1 +nz)/2 ) and nx, since nx = sqrt(1 -nz² )=sqrt( (1 -nz)(1 +nz))\n\nTherefore:\n\nnx / sqrt( 2(1 +nz ) ) = sqrt(1 -nz² ) / sqrt(2(1+nz )) = sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 )\n\nWhich matches to the previous result. So perhaps combining the terms:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ) ]\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector components are sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nWhich, in boxed form:\n\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n\nBut in the problem statement, operator is labeled as vec{P} with components Px, Py, Pz, which are analogous to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Then normalization.\n\nTherefore, this is the eigenvector for the operator in direction n.\n\nHence, given that, the answer is of this form, elements expressed in terms of the z-component of the direction vector n. Though.\n\nAlternatively, theta is more implicit here. Without knowing if theta is defined in terms of the direction.\n\nBut if we consider the direction vector\'s z-component as n_z, then your eigenvectors are in terms of n_z. Therefore, the final answer is indeed:\n\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n\nAlternatively, with the x-component:\n\nIf the question prefers to express both components using n_x and n_z. Wait, sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBut given that n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z^2 ), n_x, n_z are related, but we can\'t do much.\n\nBut if we write it as sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), as the first component and sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), as the second component, Which is okay.\n\nAlternatively, the answer might present it in exponential form if phi were involved, but since it\'s in x-z plane, phi is 0.\n\nHence, [ cos(theta/2 ); sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nAlternatively, expression with sin(theta/2 ) as a function of n_x and n_z. But maybe easier to left in terms of theta.\n\nBut as the question is posed, since it asked in terms of "along an arbitrary direction", which we can parametrise by theta, so likely the answer is simply using the half-angle formula as I derived.\n\nGiven that, my final answer is:\n\nThe normalized eigenvectors are cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 ), so boxed as:\n\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\\\ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n\nAlternatively, if parameterized by direction, just using theta as defined from the z-axis in x-z plane.\n\nBut given that no variables other than the ones present on the operators defined in the problem statement, perhaps specifying theta probably is required.\n\nAlternatively, if theta is defined as the angle from the z-axis for a direction in x-z, and the problem state it\'s in x-z, maybe theta suffice. Therefore, as you can inform, the answer boxed as such.\n\nTherefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), where theta is the polar angle in the x-z plane.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\\\ \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743808205, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6166, prompt_tokens=2237, total_tokens=8403, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by noting that the direction vector \(\vec{n}\) can be parametrized as \((n_x, 0, n_z)\) where \(n_x = \sin\theta\) and \(n_z = \cos\theta\) for some angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis.

The operator along the direction \(\vec{n}\) is given by:
\[
P_n = \sin\theta \cdot P_x + \cos\theta \cdot P_z
\]
where \(P_x\), \(P_y\), and \(P_z\) are the components of the operator \(\vec{P}\). Given the matrices for these components, we construct the matrix for \(P_n\) (ignoring the \(\hbar/2\) factor for simplicity):
\[
P_n = \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(1\) (after factoring out the \(\hbar/2\) factor), we solve the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:
1. \((\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \cdot b = 0\)
2. \(\sin\theta \cdot a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0\)

From the first equation, we find:
\[
a = \cot\theta/2 \cdot b
\]

Normalizing the eigenvector \([a, b]\) and using trigonometric identities, we find the normalized eigenvector components:
\[
\cos(\theta/2) \quad \text{and} \quad \sin(\theta/2)
\]

Expressing this in terms of the components of \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane, we use \(\theta\) as the angle from the z-axis. The normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:
\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], since phi=0.

Yes, so actually here, since we are in the x-z plane, the spherical coordinates would have phi=0 (if the direction is towards +x and +z), but theta is the angle from the z-axis.

So indeed, the eigenvector should be [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, let me check our steps again. Earlier, we found that a = cot(theta/2) * b. Then, after normalization, we get components [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]

Wait, let's see. Let me verify calculation again:

Let me assume b = sin(theta/2) , then a = cot(theta/2)*b = [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2). Then, the vector is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)], which has norm sqrt( cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ) = 1. Therefore, yes, [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)] is already normalized.

So that must be our normalized eigenvector.

Alternatively, when we said the vector is [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2); 1 ] and normalized to [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]

Therefore, seems like that is the normalized eigenvector. Let me check if with this vector, when multiplied by the matrix M, we get the eigenvalue 1.

Let's verify:

M = [[cosθ, sinθ],
     [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Vector v = [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]

Compute M*v:

First component: cosθ * cos(theta/2) + sinθ * sin(theta/2)
Second component: sinθ * cos(theta/2) - cosθ * sin(theta/2)

Compute first component:

cosθ cos(theta/2) + sinθ sin(theta/2) = cos(θ - theta/2) = cos(theta/2) (Using cosine addition formula: cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So here, A = theta, B = theta/2, so cos(theta - theta/2) = cos(theta/2))

Second component:

sinθ cos(theta/2) - cosθ sin(theta/2) = sin(theta - theta/2) = sin(theta/2)

Therefore, M*v = [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ] = 1 * v. Thus, indeed, eigenvalue 1.

Therefore, this works. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]

Wait, but theta is the angle of the direction vector n from the z-axis in the x-z plane. But to write the components, is that sufficient?

Alternatively, since the direction vector n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So theta is the polar angle.

Therefore, the eigenvector is as above. Therefore, independent of the parameter theta, we can write the components.

Wait, but wait the question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Wait, without theta? But the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane. So maybe they just want it expressed in terms of theta?

But on the other hand, maybe the coordinates can be expressed in terms of sine and cosine of theta/2 as above.

Alternatively, we could use the Bloch sphere representation, where the spin-up direction in the n direction has the components [cos(theta/2); e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)]. Since in our case phi = 0 because the direction is in x-z plane, so phi is zero.

Hence, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)], which matches our result.

Therefore, the answer is a normalized eigenvector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T. So, converting to the standard basis. Therefore, the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

But maybe we need to express theta in terms of the direction vector. Because the problem states the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So unless they want a parametric answer in terms of the components of n, or they need it symbolically as functions of theta.

But perhaps another approach. Let me explore.

Alternatively, let's parameterize the arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Let’s say n = (a, 0, b) where a² + b² =1. Then, a = sinθ, b = cosθ, so theta is the angle from z-axis.

Then, as above, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]= [sqrt( (1 + b)/2 ), sign(a) sqrt( (1 - b)/2 ) ].

But since it's in the x-z plane, and a=sinθ is positive if theta is between 0 and pi. Depending on the direction. But perhaps to express in terms of a and b, we can write:

If n = (a, 0, b), then theta is the angle such that a = sinθ, b=cosθ. Therefore, theta/2 would be such that cos(theta/2) = sqrt((1 + cosθ)/2) = sqrt((1 + b)/2) and sin(theta/2) = sqrt((1 - cosθ)/2) = sqrt((1 - b)/2). But sign? Well, theta is between 0 and pi, so theta/2 is between 0 and pi/2, so both sin and cos are positive. However, a = sintheta, so depending on theta, a is positive, so sin(theta/2) would be positive. Therefore, we can write the eigenvector components as [ sqrt( (1 + b)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - b)/2 ) ].

But in our earlier calculation, it's [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] which can be rewritten in terms of b and a.

Since cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + b)/2 ), sintheta/2 = sqrt( (1 - b)/2 )

Alternatively, since a = sin theta, then sintheta = a = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). But perhaps that complicates more.

Alternatively, since the problem says "for a muon along an arbitrary direction," but since the components of the eigenvector must be expressed in terms that direction.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants a general expression in terms of theta, which is in the x-z plane. Therefore, the answer is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. Since it's written in terms of theta, which parametrizes the direction.

But the problem might expect the eigenvector for the spin operator along an arbitrary direction in x-z plane as a general case. So without parametrizing theta, maybe it's needed to write the components in terms of sin(theta) and cos(theta), but seems like theta is the parameter here. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe I need to just express it in terms of theta, since theta is arbitrary. Therefore, theta defines the direction, so the answer is [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)].

But wait, let me look back at the question.

The problem says, "Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator vec{P} for a muon along an arbitrary direction vec{n} lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ℏ/2."

Then, the components of the operator are given. Then, it asks "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"

So the answer must be in terms of components as a column vector. But since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, but to express in terms of theta. Wait, but they probably want a symbolic answer, perhaps expressed in terms of the angle theta. Since they refer to "an arbitrary direction".

Therefore, I think the answer is:

cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2)

Hence, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But just to be thorough, let's verify again with a specific example. Suppose theta=0, i.e., direction along the z-axis. Then eigenvector should be [1, 0]^T for spin-up in z. Our formula gives cos(0) = 1 and sin(0)=0. Correct. Theta = pi: direction along -z. Then theta/2=pi/2. So cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1. So eigenvector [0;1], which is spin-down in z. Wait, but if the direction is along -z, then the eigenvalue would be -ħ/2. But wait a second. Wait, if theta is pi, then the direction n is along -z.

Wait, theta is the angle from the z-axis. So theta=0 is +z, theta=pi is -z.

But when theta=pi, operator P_n becomes:

P_n = sin(pi)P_x + cos(pi) P_z = 0*P_x + (-1) P_z = -P_z.

The eigenvalues of -P_z are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2 for operator -P_z would be the -z eigenstate for P_z. Because P_z |+z> = ħ/2 |+z>, so -P_z |+z> = -ħ/2 |+z>, thus eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2 for -P_z is |−z> which is [0,1]^T. Which in our formula, when theta=pi, cos(pi/2)=0, sin(pi/2)=1, so vector [0;1]. Exactly. So that checks out.

Similarly, if we take theta=pi/2, direction along +x. So theta=pi/2. The eigenvector should be cos(pi/4)=√2/2 and sin(pi/4)=√2/2, so [ √2/2 ; √2/2 ] which is the eigenstate of spin in +x direction. Let's verify. Operator P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenvectors for +ħ/2 are [1,1]^T normalized to 1/sqrt(2). Exactly. So also, our formula gives [cos(pi/4); sin(pi/4)] = [√2/2, √2/2].

Therefore, this formula correctly gives the eigenvectors for different theta.

Hence, the normalized eigenvector elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the answer should be:

The elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), where θ is the angle between the arbitrary direction in the x-z plane and the z-axis.

But the problem doesn't specify any parametrization. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". The problem may want the answer expressed in terms of θ without needing to mention θ? Wait, but we need θ to denote the direction.

Alternatively, maybe they expect the expression in terms of unit vector components. Since n is in the x-z plane. Suppose we let the components of n be (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² =1.

Then, can we write the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z?

Given that n_x=sinθ, n_z=cosθ. Therefore, theta = angle from z-axis, so θ = arctan( n_x / n_z )

Hence, theta/2 = 1/2 arctan( n_x / n_z )

Hmm, but expressing cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) in terms of n_x and n_z.

Alternatively, using the identity:

cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Similarly, sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But to check: since n_x = sinθ, let me confirm:

cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But since theta is in [0, pi], theta/2 is in [0, pi/2], so both cosine and sine are positive.

But note that n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So sin(theta/2) = n_x / (2 cos(theta/2 )) = n_x / (2 sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )) = n_x / (sqrt(2 (1 + n_z)) )

But maybe messy, so perhaps it's better expressed as:

[n_z +1 , n_x ] or so, but let me think.

Alternatively, if we use the direction vector n = (n_x, 0, n_z), the eigenvectors can be written as:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]

But without considering the sign, but since n is in the x-z plane, n_x is positive (assuming direction is in positive x-z). If not, theta can be greater than pi, but keeping n_z between -1 and 1. However, if the direction is arbitrary, perhaps you just need to give it in terms of components.

But n_x and n_z must satisfy n_x² + n_z²=1. Hence, cos(theta/2 )= sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sintheta/2= sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ), and because n_x = sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

Thus, combining those,

sin(theta/2) = n_x / (2 cos(theta/2 )) => n_x = 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )

Alternatively, to make everything in terms of n_x and n_z, but maybe complicates.

Alternatively, if the direction is given parametrically via theta, then keeping the answer as [ cos(theta/2 ), sintheta/2 ] is acceptable.

Since the problem states "arbitrary direction", and eigenvectors depend on that direction (theta), so in terms of theta.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a general answer, regardless of theta, but the question says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?"

Since eigenvectors depend on the direction, so perhaps the answer needs to include theta.

Therefore, to sum up, the normalized eigenvector is:

[cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]

expresses as:

First component: cos(theta/2)

Second component: sin(theta/2)

Therefore, the elements are cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 )

But since the problem didn't specify variables and says "lying in the x-z plane", perhaps given that, sin theta and cos theta as per the direction. But theta is defined from the z-axis.

Alternatively, the question itself didn't mention theta. Wait, actually, the problem didn't mention theta at all, except for me parametrizing it. The problem states "arbitrary direction vec{n} lying in the x-z plane", then gives the components of operators. So direction vector n=(n_x, 0, n_z) with n_x² + n_z²=1.

Therefore, perhaps answer in terms of n_x and n_z:

But as we saw, cos(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sin(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ). But how to write in terms of n_x?

Since theta is determined by n_z = cos theta, so n_x = sin theta.

Then, theta/2 can be defined, but I can multiply and divide by sqrt(2(1 + n_z)) }

Alternatively, use:

sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) ± sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But doesn't seem necessary. Alternatively, express as [sqrt(1 + n_z), sqrt(1 - n_z) ] divided by sqrt(2), but if we write sqrt((1 + n_z)/2 ) as sqrt(1 + n_z)/sqrt(2).

Alternatively, to write as (1 + n_z)/sqrt(2(1 + n_z)) ). Wait, not helpful.

Alternatively, since n_x = sin theta, which is sqrt(1 -n_z² ). So maybe express the eigenvector elements in terms of n_z:

But it's complicated.

Alternatively, there is a parametrization:

[ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But given that n_x = sin theta, n_z = cos theta, how would that look.

Let me relate theta/2 approach. The problem is the answer requires elements expressed whether in terms of some variable or just the answer. Since they mentioned the direction is arbitrary, yet we might need to express it generally, but the problem is presented without given theta or variables; the matrix components need to be defined in terms of the direction vector. But perhaps the problem expects a general answer like [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] as theta is defined from the z-axis in the x-z plane. Since this is conventional. So unless it's intended to just present those terms.

Therefore, my conclusion is that the normalized eigenvector is:

|ψ> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T

Therefore, written as the elements,

- First element: cos(theta/2)

- Second element: sin(theta/2)

Therefore, boxed as:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}

But theta is angle from z-axis in x-z plane, yes.

Alternatively, if written using the direction vector n, it is:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}

But given n lies in x-z plane, so ny=0, and n_x = sin theta and n_z = cos theta. So substituting, gives:

sqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

sqrt( (1 - cos theta)/2 ) = sin(theta/2 )

Therefore, if we use polar coordinates.

So the answer would be either in terms of theta or in terms of n_z and n_x. Probably since the question introduces the direction vector n, they might expect the answer in terms of n.

Why?

Because the problem says "along an arbitrary direction vec{n} lying in the x-z plane". So maybe it's more appropriate to express the eigenvector components in terms of the components of vector n. So strictly, n is given. So::

Let me note n = (nx, 0, nz) with nx² + nz²=1. Then we need to write the eigenvector elements in terms of nx and nz.

From theta parametrization,

cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 ) and sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - nz)/2 )

But since nx = sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

Let’s verify.

If we write the components as:

[ sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ) , sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ) ]

Then notice that:

sin theta = nx = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

But in terms of nz:

nz = cos theta = 2 cos²(theta/2) -1 ⇒ 2 cos²(theta/2) =1 +nz ⇒ cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 )

and sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 )

Then,

nx = sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ) = 2*sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 )*sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ) = 2*sqrt( (1 -nz)(1 +nz)/4 ))= 2*(sqrt(1 -nz²))/2)= sqrt(1 -nz² )

Which matches our since nx = sin theta = sqrt(1 - cos² theta)=sqrt(1 - nz² )

But yes, conforming. Therefore, the components could be written in terms of nz as [sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ) ]^T

However, nx= sqrt(1 -nz² ). So perhaps write sin(theta/2 ) in terms of nx and nz. According to sin(theta/2 )=sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ), but we must note sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ), perhaps.  Either way.

But the problem is that if answer expected is in terms of the components of n they might expect expressed as [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ].

Wait, but using trigonometric identities, sin(theta/2) can also be expressed in terms of nx.

We have:

nx = sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )

So we have:

sin(theta/2 ) = nx / (2 cos(theta/2 )) = nx / (2*sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 )) = nx / sqrt(2(1 +nz))

But in theory, sin(theta/2) can be written in terms of nx and nz. But then:

Total vector would be:

[ sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ), nx / sqrt(2(1 +nz)) ]

But in this case, they both depend on nz and nx.

But likely it's redundant, since expressing it via nz is sufficient as in the earlier form.

Alternatively, noting that in the x-z plane, direction n is (nx, 0, nz), so we can construct the eigenvector as:

|ψ> = [ sqrt((1 +nz)/2 ), (nx / sqrt(2(1 +nz))) ]

But this is also valid. Simplifying via substitution:

sqrt((1 +nz)/2 ) and nx, since nx = sqrt(1 -nz² )=sqrt( (1 -nz)(1 +nz))

Therefore:

nx / sqrt( 2(1 +nz ) ) = sqrt(1 -nz² ) / sqrt(2(1+nz )) = sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 )

Which matches to the previous result. So perhaps combining the terms:

[ sqrt( (1 +nz)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 ) ]

Therefore, the eigenvector components are sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Which, in boxed form:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}

But in the problem statement, operator is labeled as vec{P} with components Px, Py, Pz, which are analogous to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Then normalization.

Therefore, this is the eigenvector for the operator in direction n.

Hence, given that, the answer is of this form, elements expressed in terms of the z-component of the direction vector n. Though.

Alternatively, theta is more implicit here. Without knowing if theta is defined in terms of the direction.

But if we consider the direction vector's z-component as n_z, then your eigenvectors are in terms of n_z. Therefore, the final answer is indeed:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}

Alternatively, with the x-component:

If the question prefers to express both components using n_x and n_z. Wait, sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But given that n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z^2 ), n_x, n_z are related, but we can't do much.

But if we write it as sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), as the first component and sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), as the second component, Which is okay.

Alternatively, the answer might present it in exponential form if phi were involved, but since it's in x-z plane, phi is 0.

Hence, [ cos(theta/2 ); sin(theta/2 ) ]

Alternatively, expression with sin(theta/2 ) as a function of n_x and n_z. But maybe easier to left in terms of theta.

But as the question is posed, since it asked in terms of "along an arbitrary direction", which we can parametrise by theta, so likely the answer is simply using the half-angle formula as I derived.

Given that, my final answer is:

The normalized eigenvectors are cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 ), so boxed as:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}

Alternatively, if parameterized by direction, just using theta as defined from the z-axis in x-z plane.

But given that no variables other than the ones present on the operators defined in the problem statement, perhaps specifying theta probably is required.

Alternatively, if theta is defined as the angle from the z-axis for a direction in x-z, and the problem state it's in x-z, maybe theta suffice. Therefore, as you can inform, the answer boxed as such.

Therefore, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), where theta is the polar angle in the x-z plane.

**Final Answer**
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The normalized eigenvector of the operator \(\vec{P}\) along the direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane with eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\) is given by:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Operator Construction:**
   - The spin operator \(\vec{P}\) in direction \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\) is \(P_n = \sin\theta \, P_x + \cos\theta \, P_z\).
   - Using the given Pauli matrices scaled by \(\hbar/2\):
     \[
     P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}.
     \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation:**
   - Solve \(P_n|\psi\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2}|\psi\rangle\) leading to:
     \[
     \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]
   
3. **Find Eigenvector:**
   - Solve the system of equations to express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) (or vice versa). Using trigonometric identities simplifies to:
     \[
     a = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) b.
     \]
   
4. **Normalization:**
   - The vector \(\begin{pmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) is normalized by multiplying with \(\sin(\theta/2)\), resulting in:
     \[
     \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}.
     \]

This vector represents the spin-up state along \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 normalized eigenvector is:
[sin(θ/2)cot(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T
But sinθ = 2sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2), so cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)

Thus, sin(θ/2) * cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T

Alternatively, by convention, in terms of eigenvectors of spin-z, a general spin-up along direction θ in x-z plane can be written as:
|+n⟩ = cos(θ/2)|+z⟩ + sin(θ/2)|-z⟩
But maybe this is in the computational basis, which is eigenbasis for σ_z.

Hence the components are indeed [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] when expressed in the z-basis.

So the normalized eigenvector elements are cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2), or considering different conventions, maybe using exp terms but here y-component is 0.

Wait, the operator setup here: if theta is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane, then the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). In spin-1/2, the eigenvector for spin-up in this direction uses the polar angle theta with phi = 0. Therefore, the eigenvector components are [cos(theta/2), e^{i0} sin(theta/2)] = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. However, this is only when expressing in the z-basis.\n\nAnother way is to diagonalize the constructed matrix. Alternatively, note that P_n has to have eigenvalues ±ħ/2, as that\'s the nature of spin-1/2 operators. The eigenvectors can be found as per standard procedure.\n\nGiven M is [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]], then eigenvalues of M are solutions to the characteristic equation:\n\ndet(M - λ I)=0\n\nWhich is:\n\n(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - sin²θ = 0\n\nExpand:\n\n(-cos²θ - cosθ λ + cosθ λ + λ²) - sin²θ = 0\n\nWait, careful expansion:\n\n(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = ( -cos²θ - cosθ λ + lambda cosθ + λ² ) [ Wait, actually:\n\n(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = -cosθ^2 - cosθ λ + lambda cosθ + λ^2 = -cos²θ - λ^2 [Because cross terms cancel? Let\'s check: cosθ * -lambda + (-lambda) * -lambda??)\n\nWait, perhaps clearer:\n\nMultiply (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = ( -cosθ * cosθ - cosθ * lambda + lambda * cosθ + lambda^2 )\n\nSo: -cos²θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ² = -cos²θ + λ²\n\nTherefore det: -cos²θ + λ² - sin²θ = λ² - (cos²θ + sin²θ) = λ² -1 =0\n\nThus, the eigenvalues are λ=±1.\n\nHence, yes, M has eigenvalues ±1, so multiplied by ħ/2 indeed gives ±ħ/2. Therefore, as expected for spin-1/2 systems.\n\nThus for eigenvalue +1, the eigenvector computed was [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)].\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, to derive it step-by-step:\n\nLet’s take the normalized eigenvector components as (a, b).\n\nFrom the eigenvalue equation M |v> = |v>, implying:\n\ncosθ a + sinθ b = a\n\nsinθ a - cosθ b = b\n\nFrom first equation:\n\ncosθ a + sinθ b = a ⇒ sinθ b = a (1 - cosθ )\n\nTherefore, b = [ (1 - cosθ ) / sinθ ] a\n\n1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2 ), sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )\n\nThus,\n\nb = [ 2 sin²(theta/2 ) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )) ] a = [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ] a = tan(theta/2 ) a.\n\nTherefore, if we let a = cos(theta/2 ), then b = sin(theta/2 )\n\nSo the unnormalized vector becomes (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )) which is already normalized:\n\n|a|² + |b|² = cos²(theta/2 ) + sin²(theta/2 ) = 1.\n\nPerfect, so the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]\n\nHence, representing the components of the eigenvector for the operator along direction n (in x-z plane) as a two-component spinor.\n\nTherefore, regardless of theta, expressed in the standard basis (eigenstates of sigma_z), the spin up eigenvector along n is as above.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]\n\nBut since the question says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", do we need to express it in terms of theta or in symbolic form? The problem does not give a specific angle; hence, the answer must provide the eigenvector in terms of theta. However, often, spheres or spin eigenvectors are written in terms of spherical coordinates, which do involve theta in this case.\n\nAlternatively, as parametrized components.\n\nBut given we achieved the result [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )], normalized, that\'s the eigenvector for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue of polarization along the n (theta in x-z plane) direction.\n\nBut let\'s check the initial approximation. If theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, n points in (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)), then yes. The eigenvectors are expressed as:\n\nFor spin up in the direction (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)) would be indeed [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].\n\nBut another way to check this is to take some specific angles and see. For instance, when theta = 0, the direction n is along +z. Then eigenvectors should be [1; 0], which is indeed [cos(0); sin(0)] = [1; 0] which is correct.\n\nWhen theta = pi/2, the direction is along +x. The eigenvalue equation would be eigenvector of P_x, which is (1/sqrt(2))[1;1]. However, our formula for theta = pi/2 gives [cos(pi/4); sin(pi/4)] = [√2/2; √2/2]. Indeed normalized. Sum squared of components is ( (√2/2)^2 + (√2/2)^2 )= 0.5 +0.5 =1. So this is correct. And check with eigenvalue:\n\nFor theta = pi/2, the matrix operator would be (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]], which is the same as sigma_x divided 2. The eigenvector [1;1]/sqrt(2) is indeed the eigenvector for sigma_x with eigenvalue +1; multiplied by ħ/2 gives +ħ/2, so all checks out.\n\nSimilarly, reversing, let theta = pi (direction along -z). Then cos(theta/2 ) is cos(pi/2 )=0, and sin(theta/2 ) = sin(pi/2 )=1. Hence, eigenvector [0;1], which is indeed the eigenvector for sigma_z in -z direction. Which gives eigenvalue (sigma_z acting on it: [1,0;0,-1] times [0;1] = [0; -1], but our eigenvector should correspond to eigenvalue +1 for [+n] direction. Wait, for theta pi, the direction vector n is -z, but spin-up along -z is eigenvalue -1( in units of sigma_z ).\n\nActually this reflects an important point. When angle theta is measured from +z, but the spinor for direction theta is for spin in the direction of n. If direction n is along +z (theta=0), spinor is [1;0], and eigenvalue +ħ/2. If the direction n is along -z (theta=pi), our formula gives [cos(pi/2); sin(pi/2)]= [0;1], and acting P_z on [0;1] gives eigenvalue=-ħ/2. But wait, in the problem statement P_n is parametrizing the operator, so if we have theta = pi, we need to check if P_n is along -z, and the eigenvector [0;1] indeed corresponds to -ħ/2 eigenvalue, but in our question, we required the eigenvalue +ħ/2, so perhaps the angle theta cannot be pi. So there\'s a condition ?\n\nHowever, if theta equals pi, but we need eigenvalue + ħ/2 in direction n=-z, which would require [0;1] eigenvector to have eigenvalue +ħ/2. But sigma_z on [0;1] gives -1, which multiplied by ħ/2 would be -ħ/2.\n\nSo clearly, for theta=pi, the direction is -z, our eigenstate would correspond to eigenvalue -ħ/2, but the question says eigenvalue +ħ/2. Therefore, maybe theta is restricted less than pi, but in the x-z plane? Alternatively, perhaps when we take the Operator P_n = sin(theta) P_x + cos(theta P_z ), even for theta=pi, sin(theta)=0, cos(theta)=-1, so P_n= -P_z. Then eigenvalue equation would be -P_z |v> = (ħ/2 ) |v>. So, - (ħ/2 ) sigma_z |v> = (ħ/2 )|v>\n\nWhich gives sigma_z |v> = - |v>\n\nSo |v> must be [0;1].\n\nBut [0;1] has eigenvalue -1 under sigma_z. Therefore, the operator P_n here for theta=pi in direction -z has eigenvector [0;1] with eigenvalue -ħ/2.\n\nBut the problem specifies the eigenvalue should be +ħ/2, so requires eigenvalue +1 for the M matrix.\n\nWait maybe my confusion arises because when theta becomes larger than pi... Hmm, perhaps the problem is not so much concerned with that since an arbitrary direction in x-z plane can always be parametrized with 0 <= theta <2pi or so.\n\nBut regardless, in our computation, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 of M corresponds to [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )] with theta being the angle from +z axis, which in standard spherical coordinates would produce the spin state in that direction.\n\nBut the question didn\'t specify to write the answer in terms of theta, but asked for the elements of the normalized eigenvectors. Since theta is arbitrary, it has to be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions of theta.\n\nThus, wrapping up, the normalized eigenvector will have components:\n\nFirst element: cos(theta/2)\n\nSecond element: sin(theta/2)\n\nSo the elements are [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]\n\nBut theta is the polar angle in the x-z plane from z-axis. Thus, written in terms of theta, as given along arbitrary direction n situated in the x-z plane.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if written in terms of direction n, as for real, parametrizing direction n as the vector (nx, 0, nz), since it\'s in the x-z plane. Let me resolve this.\n\nGiven that n is a unit vector in x-z plane: n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Then, theta is the angle from the z-axis. So the spin eigenvector in direction n with eigenvalue +1 (which scales to +ħ/2 once you factor in the constants) is [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )].\n\nAnother approach: generalize the spinor for direction n.\n\nFor a spin-1/2 particle, the spin state pointing in direction n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) is given by:\n|n; +> = [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]\n\nIn our case, since direction n is in x-z plane, phi=0, so sin(phi)=0, phi=0. So the spinor is:\n\n[cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].\n\nWhich is consistent with our previous result.\n\nSo the final elements are [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector\'s elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

However, check again whether the problem is exactly expecting the answer in terms of theta or as possibly a different parametrization. The problem says "lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ℏ/2". However, direction n is arbitrary, so the components naturally depend on direction parameters. Since nothing was specified on how to parametrize, but given the components of the operator in terms of theta (implicitly, theta is the angle from z-axis)⇒ probably answer should be in terms of theta as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps without any parameters.

To calculate the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by noting that the components of the operator \(\vec{P}\) are given by the Pauli matrices scaled by \(\hbar/2\). The operator along the direction \(\vec{n}\) is a combination of the x and z components since \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane.

1. **Direction Vector and Operator**:
   - The direction vector \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane can be parametrized as \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the z-axis.
   - The operator along \(\vec{n}\) is \(P_n = \sin\theta \cdot P_x + \cos\theta \cdot P_z\).

2. **Matrix Representation**:
   - \(P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
   - \(P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}\)
   - Combined operator: \(P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right)\)
   - Simplifies to: \(P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}\)

3. **Eigenvalue Equation**:
   - We seek the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). This requires solving \((P_n - \frac{\hbar}{2}I)|\psi\rangle = 0\).
   - The matrix equation reduces to \(\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = 0\).

4. **Solving the Eigenvector**:
   - From the equations, we find \(a = \cot(\theta/2) \cdot b\). Normalizing the vector results in the components \(\cos(\theta/2)\) and \(\sin(\theta/2)\).

5. **Result**:
   - The normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix}\).

Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:

\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

 Therefore, the eigenstate should indeed be [cos(θ/2); sin(θ/2)].

However, it's crucial to confirm this construction with the given operator. Wait, the operator setup here: if theta is the angle from the z-axis in the x-z plane, then the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). In spin-1/2, the eigenvector for spin-up in this direction uses the polar angle theta with phi = 0. Therefore, the eigenvector components are [cos(theta/2), e^{i0} sin(theta/2)] = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. However, this is only when expressing in the z-basis.

Another way is to diagonalize the constructed matrix. Alternatively, note that P_n has to have eigenvalues ±ħ/2, as that's the nature of spin-1/2 operators. The eigenvectors can be found as per standard procedure.

Given M is [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]], then eigenvalues of M are solutions to the characteristic equation:

det(M - λ I)=0

Which is:

(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) - sin²θ = 0

Expand:

(-cos²θ - cosθ λ + cosθ λ + λ²) - sin²θ = 0

Wait, careful expansion:

(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = ( -cos²θ - cosθ λ + lambda cosθ + λ² ) [ Wait, actually:

(cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = -cosθ^2 - cosθ λ + lambda cosθ + λ^2 = -cos²θ - λ^2 [Because cross terms cancel? Let's check: cosθ * -lambda + (-lambda) * -lambda??)

Wait, perhaps clearer:

Multiply (cosθ - λ)(-cosθ - λ) = ( -cosθ * cosθ - cosθ * lambda + lambda * cosθ + lambda^2 )

So: -cos²θ - λ cosθ + λ cosθ + λ² = -cos²θ + λ²

Therefore det: -cos²θ + λ² - sin²θ = λ² - (cos²θ + sin²θ) = λ² -1 =0

Thus, the eigenvalues are λ=±1.

Hence, yes, M has eigenvalues ±1, so multiplied by ħ/2 indeed gives ±ħ/2. Therefore, as expected for spin-1/2 systems.

Thus for eigenvalue +1, the eigenvector computed was [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)].

Yes.

Alternatively, to derive it step-by-step:

Let’s take the normalized eigenvector components as (a, b).

From the eigenvalue equation M |v> = |v>, implying:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a

sinθ a - cosθ b = b

From first equation:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a ⇒ sinθ b = a (1 - cosθ )

Therefore, b = [ (1 - cosθ ) / sinθ ] a

1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2 ), sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

Thus,

b = [ 2 sin²(theta/2 ) / (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )) ] a = [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ] a = tan(theta/2 ) a.

Therefore, if we let a = cos(theta/2 ), then b = sin(theta/2 )

So the unnormalized vector becomes (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )) which is already normalized:

|a|² + |b|² = cos²(theta/2 ) + sin²(theta/2 ) = 1.

Perfect, so the normalized eigenvector is:

[cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]

Hence, representing the components of the eigenvector for the operator along direction n (in x-z plane) as a two-component spinor.

Therefore, regardless of theta, expressed in the standard basis (eigenstates of sigma_z), the spin up eigenvector along n is as above.

Therefore, the answer is:

[cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]

But since the question says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", do we need to express it in terms of theta or in symbolic form? The problem does not give a specific angle; hence, the answer must provide the eigenvector in terms of theta. However, often, spheres or spin eigenvectors are written in terms of spherical coordinates, which do involve theta in this case.

Alternatively, as parametrized components.

But given we achieved the result [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )], normalized, that's the eigenvector for the +ħ/2 eigenvalue of polarization along the n (theta in x-z plane) direction.

But let's check the initial approximation. If theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, n points in (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)), then yes. The eigenvectors are expressed as:

For spin up in the direction (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)) would be indeed [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

But another way to check this is to take some specific angles and see. For instance, when theta = 0, the direction n is along +z. Then eigenvectors should be [1; 0], which is indeed [cos(0); sin(0)] = [1; 0] which is correct.

When theta = pi/2, the direction is along +x. The eigenvalue equation would be eigenvector of P_x, which is (1/sqrt(2))[1;1]. However, our formula for theta = pi/2 gives [cos(pi/4); sin(pi/4)] = [√2/2; √2/2]. Indeed normalized. Sum squared of components is ( (√2/2)^2 + (√2/2)^2 )= 0.5 +0.5 =1. So this is correct. And check with eigenvalue:

For theta = pi/2, the matrix operator would be (ħ/2)[[0,1],[1,0]], which is the same as sigma_x divided 2. The eigenvector [1;1]/sqrt(2) is indeed the eigenvector for sigma_x with eigenvalue +1; multiplied by ħ/2 gives +ħ/2, so all checks out.

Similarly, reversing, let theta = pi (direction along -z). Then cos(theta/2 ) is cos(pi/2 )=0, and sin(theta/2 ) = sin(pi/2 )=1. Hence, eigenvector [0;1], which is indeed the eigenvector for sigma_z in -z direction. Which gives eigenvalue (sigma_z acting on it: [1,0;0,-1] times [0;1] = [0; -1], but our eigenvector should correspond to eigenvalue +1 for [+n] direction. Wait, for theta pi, the direction vector n is -z, but spin-up along -z is eigenvalue -1( in units of sigma_z ).

Actually this reflects an important point. When angle theta is measured from +z, but the spinor for direction theta is for spin in the direction of n. If direction n is along +z (theta=0), spinor is [1;0], and eigenvalue +ħ/2. If the direction n is along -z (theta=pi), our formula gives [cos(pi/2); sin(pi/2)]= [0;1], and acting P_z on [0;1] gives eigenvalue=-ħ/2. But wait, in the problem statement P_n is parametrizing the operator, so if we have theta = pi, we need to check if P_n is along -z, and the eigenvector [0;1] indeed corresponds to -ħ/2 eigenvalue, but in our question, we required the eigenvalue +ħ/2, so perhaps the angle theta cannot be pi. So there's a condition ?

However, if theta equals pi, but we need eigenvalue + ħ/2 in direction n=-z, which would require [0;1] eigenvector to have eigenvalue +ħ/2. But sigma_z on [0;1] gives -1, which multiplied by ħ/2 would be -ħ/2.

So clearly, for theta=pi, the direction is -z, our eigenstate would correspond to eigenvalue -ħ/2, but the question says eigenvalue +ħ/2. Therefore, maybe theta is restricted less than pi, but in the x-z plane? Alternatively, perhaps when we take the Operator P_n = sin(theta) P_x + cos(theta P_z ), even for theta=pi, sin(theta)=0, cos(theta)=-1, so P_n= -P_z. Then eigenvalue equation would be -P_z |v> = (ħ/2 ) |v>. So, - (ħ/2 ) sigma_z |v> = (ħ/2 )|v>

Which gives sigma_z |v> = - |v>

So |v> must be [0;1].

But [0;1] has eigenvalue -1 under sigma_z. Therefore, the operator P_n here for theta=pi in direction -z has eigenvector [0;1] with eigenvalue -ħ/2.

But the problem specifies the eigenvalue should be +ħ/2, so requires eigenvalue +1 for the M matrix.

Wait maybe my confusion arises because when theta becomes larger than pi... Hmm, perhaps the problem is not so much concerned with that since an arbitrary direction in x-z plane can always be parametrized with 0 <= theta <2pi or so.

But regardless, in our computation, the eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 of M corresponds to [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )] with theta being the angle from +z axis, which in standard spherical coordinates would produce the spin state in that direction.

But the question didn't specify to write the answer in terms of theta, but asked for the elements of the normalized eigenvectors. Since theta is arbitrary, it has to be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions of theta.

Thus, wrapping up, the normalized eigenvector will have components:

First element: cos(theta/2)

Second element: sin(theta/2)

So the elements are [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )]

But theta is the polar angle in the x-z plane from z-axis. Thus, written in terms of theta, as given along arbitrary direction n situated in the x-z plane.

Alternatively, perhaps if written in terms of direction n, as for real, parametrizing direction n as the vector (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane. Let me resolve this.

Given that n is a unit vector in x-z plane: n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Then, theta is the angle from the z-axis. So the spin eigenvector in direction n with eigenvalue +1 (which scales to +ħ/2 once you factor in the constants) is [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )].

Another approach: generalize the spinor for direction n.

For a spin-1/2 particle, the spin state pointing in direction n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) is given by:
|n; +> = [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]

In our case, since direction n is in x-z plane, phi=0, so sin(phi)=0, phi=0. So the spinor is:

[cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

Which is consistent with our previous result.

So the final elements are [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector's elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Although theta is arbitrary, they must be presented as such.

Hence, the answer is the normalized eigenvector:

[ \cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2) ]

Probably wrapped in a vector notation. However, check again whether the problem is exactly expecting the answer in terms of theta or as possibly a different parametrization. The problem says "lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ℏ/2". However, direction n is arbitrary, so the components naturally depend on direction parameters. Since nothing was specified on how to parametrize, but given the components of the operator in terms of theta (implicitly, theta is the angle from z-axis)⇒ probably answer should be in terms of theta as above.

Alternatively, perhaps without any parameters. Wait, perhaps directional vector n can be rewritten to express the eigenvector not in angular terms but in terms of the components nx and nz (since ny=0). n = (nx, 0,nz), where nx^2 +nz^2=1.

Wait, then defining, theta such that nx=sinθ, nz=cosθ. Therefore, we can express the eigenvectors as [ sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - nz)/2 ) ]. Because:

cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 )

sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - nz)/2 )

Alternatively, to check:

cos(theta/2 ) can be written in terms of nz:

cos(theta/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 )

Similarly, sin(theta/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - nz)/2 )

But the question says, "an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", so possibly to write in terms of nx and nz. However, typically, that's the formulas above, but:

Given that nx=sinθ, nz=cosθ, so theta/theta can be replaced with expressions in terms of nz. Alternatively, nx can relate.

But the problem likely expects the answer in terms of theta or maybe in terms of sine and cosine of theta, given they define n direction how.

Alternatively, equally valid, if we do not use theta and write eigenvectors:

[ sqrt( (1 + nz)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - nz)/2) ] but with the tau that nz^2 + nx^2=1.

But since theta is undefined variable here except specifying direction in x-z plane, but problem is to be self contained, so the anticipated answer is probably wrote in terms of theta, that is [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2)].

Thus, given that, the elements of normalized eigenvectors are cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 )

Therefore, in boxed notation:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}

Must feel confident as correctness by check with phi=0 in standard spin up direction.

**Final Answer**
The normalized eigenvector elements are \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}.
