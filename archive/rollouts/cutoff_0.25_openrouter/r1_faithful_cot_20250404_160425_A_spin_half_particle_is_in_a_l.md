To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we start by noting the Pauli matrices:

\[
\sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The given state vector is \(|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), which can be written as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix}
\]

First, we calculate the expectation values of \(\sigma_z\) and \(\sigma_x\) separately.

1. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_z\):**
   \[
   \langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 - \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = (0.25) - (0.75) = -0.5
   \]

2. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_x\):**
   \[
   \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
   \]

Next, we combine these results using the linearity of the expectation value:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
\]

Calculating the numerical value:

\[
10(-0.5) = -5
\]
\[
5\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \approx 5 \cdot 0.866 = 4.33
\]

Adding these results:

\[
-5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is:

\[
\boxed{-0.7}
\]

Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for a spin-half particle that's in the state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling what expectation value means. The expectation value of an operator is like the average value you would expect to measure if you measured that observable many times on systems prepared in the same state. The formula for the expectation value of an operator A in a state |ψ⟩ is ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩.

So here, the operator is a combination of σ_z and σ_x. I know σ_z and σ_x are the Pauli matrices. Let me write them down to be clear. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of σ_z are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are represented as column vectors. Let me think, σ_z is diagonal with eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

Similarly, σ_x is the Pauli matrix that's off-diagonal. The exact matrices are:

σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So maybe I can write out the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x component-wise. Let's compute that first. Multiplying each matrix by the coefficients and then adding them:

10σ_z = 10*[[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[10, 0], [0, -10]]
5σ_x = 5*[[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[0, 5], [5, 0]]

Adding them together:

10σ_z +5σ_x = [[10+0, 0+5], [0+5, -10+0]] = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]

Okay, so the operator matrix is [[10, 5], [5, -10]]. 

Now, the state vector is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's represent that as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]^T, so the state vector |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1; 0] + (√3)/2 * [0; 1] = [0.5; (√3)/2]

To find the expectation value, I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σ_z +5σ_x) |ψ⟩.

Alternatively, to compute the expectation value of 10σ_z +5σ_x, you can split it into 10 times the expectation of σ_z plus 5 times the expectation of σ_x. Because expectation is linear. So maybe it's easier to compute them separately and then add. Let me see.

Let me remember that: for a state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σ_z is |a|^2 - |b|^2, since σ_z on |↑> gives +1 and |↓> gives -1, weighted by their probabilities.

Similarly, the expectation value of σ_x is a*b* + b*a*, where * denotes complex conjugate. Because σ_x flips the spin, so ⟨σ_x⟩ for the state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ would be ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. Let's compute that:

σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0 1;1 0][a; b] = [b; a], so inner product ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ is [a*, b*] [b; a] = a* b + b* a = 2 Re(a* b). If a and b are real numbers, then this is just 2ab.

So here, since in our case, the coefficients 0.5 and √3/2 are both real numbers, right? Yes, since there's no imaginary unit in the given state. So we can compute ⟨σ_z⟩ and ⟨σ_x⟩ separately.

OK, let's compute each expectation value.

First, compute ⟨σ_z⟩. |a|^2 - |b|^2. The coefficients are 0.5 and √3/2. Since they're real, |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Similarly, |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σ_z⟩ is 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Next compute ⟨σ_x⟩. Since the coefficients are real, then as I thought, it's 2ab. So 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

But wait, hold on. Wait a minute. Let's verify this. Because if the state is a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then:

⟨σ_x⟩ can be calculated as the sum over the matrix elements. Let me check again. The σ_x matrix has elements [0 1;1 0]. So the expectation value is:

⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [a, b] [0 1;1 0] [a; b]?

Wait that's a^T σ_x b . Let me actually multiply this out. Let's denote |ψ⟩ as a column vector [a; b].

Then σ_x acting on |ψ⟩ gives [b; a]. Then to compute the inner product ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩, which is [a*, b*][b; a] = a* b + b* a. Since a and b are real numbers here, it's ab + ba = 2ab. So yes, that's correct. So in this case, a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2, so 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660...

So then, getting back, the expectation of 10σ_z +5σ_x will be 10*⟨σ_z⟩ + 5*⟨σ_x⟩.

From above, we've found ⟨σ_z⟩ = -0.5 and ⟨σ_x⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So substituting the values: 10*(-0.5) + 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

Let me compute this value numerically. sqrt(3) is approx 1.732, so:

(5*1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈ 4.33

So total expectation value is -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, but maybe I should be more precise. Let's check with exact values. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.7320508075688772...

So (sqrt(3)/2) *5 = (1.7320508075688772 / 2)*5 ≈ 0.8660254037844386 *5 ≈ 4.330127018922193.

Now, subtracting 5 gives 4.330127018922193 -5 = -0.6698729810778072.

Which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So yeah, the expected value is approximately -0.7.

Alternatively, perhaps multiple calculation steps can affect precision? Let me confirm this with an alternative approach where I compute the matrix product directly, perhaps compute the expectation value using the vector and operator.

So operator is:

[[10,5],[5, -10]]

State vector is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Let's write this as components. Let me compute the result first of applying the operator to the state. Let's compute A|ψ⟩, where A is [[10,5],[5, -10]]:

First component: 10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = 5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2

Second component: 5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 2.5 -5 sqrt(3)

Now, then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So inner product:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] • [5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2, 2.5 -5 sqrt(3)]

Compute each part:

First component: 0.5*(5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2) = 0.5*5 + 0.5*(5 sqrt(3)/2) = 2.5 + (5 sqrt(3))/4

Second component: sqrt(3)/2*(2.5 -5 sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(3)/2)*2.5 - (sqrt(3)/2)*5 sqrt(3) = (2.5 sqrt(3))/2 - (5*3)/2 = (2.5 sqrt(3))/2 - 15/2

Now sum them together:

2.5 + (5 sqrt(3))/4 + (2.5 sqrt(3))/2 -15/2

Compute the constants and sqrt(3) terms separately.

Constants: 2.5 -15/2 = 2.5 -7.5 = -5.0

Sqrt(3) terms: (5 sqrt(3))/4 + (2.5 sqrt(3))/2

We can convert 2.5 to 5/2, so (5/2 sqrt(3))/2 = (5 sqrt(3))/4.

So sqrt(3) terms are (5 sqrt(3))/4 + (5 sqrt(3))/4 = (10 sqrt(3))/4 = (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈5*1.732/2≈ 8.66/2≈4.33

Adding to the constants: -5.0 +4.33≈-0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Same as before.

So both approaches seem to give the same result.

Therefore, the answer is -0.7, so the expectation value is \boxed{-0.7}. 

But wait, let me double-check the first idea with breaking into expectation values. Maybe I confused sigma x and sigma z here?

Wait, real quick: when I thought the formula for ⟨σ_x⟩ is ab* + a* b, but in my simpler case where coefficients are real, that's 2ab. Correct. So [0.5] [sqrt(3)/2]* + [sqrt(3)/2][0.5] which is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)*2 =0.5*(sqrt(3)/1). Hmm, no: wait, 2ab where a=0.5 and b=sqrt(3)/2. So 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) =2*(sqrt(3)/4)=sqrt(3)/2.

Exactly. So equal to approx 0.866. Then 10*(-0.5) is -5.0 and 5*0.866=4.33. Sum of these is -5.0+4.33≈-0.67. To one decimal, -0.7. The same as the matrix approach. So all checks out. So, yeah, confident the answer is -0.7.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{-0.7}$.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-0.7}

Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for a spin-half particle that's in the state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩.

5σ_x = 5*[[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[0, 5], [5, 0]]

Adding them together:

10σ_z +5σ_x = [[10+0, 0+5], [0+5, -10+0]] = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]

Okay, so the operator matrix is [[10, 5], [5, -10]]. 

Now, the state vector is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's represent that as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0, 1]^T, so the state vector |ψ⟩ is:

To find the expectation value, I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σ_z +5σ_x) |ψ⟩.

Alternatively, to compute the expectation value of 10σ_z +5σ_x, you can split it int

Alright, I need to determine the expected value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for a spin-half particle in the state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Let me first understand what an expectation value represents. The expectation value of an operator represents the average result you would obtain if you performed multiple measurements of that observable on identical systems prepared in the same state. For an operator A in state |ψ⟩, the expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩.

In this problem, I'm working with a combination of Pauli matrices σ_z and σ_x. These are 2×2 matrices used in quantum mechanics for spin-1/2 systems. The eigenstates of σ_z are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which can be written as column vectors. I'll note that σ_z is diagonal with eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, while σ_x is off-diagonal.

The matrices are specifically:
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

I'll calculate the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x by multiplying each matrix by its coefficient and then adding:

10σ_z = 10*[[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[10, 0], [0, -10]]
5σ_x = 5*[[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[0, 5], [5, 0]]

When added together:
10σ_z + 5σ_x = [[10, 0], [0, -10]] + [[0, 5], [5, 0]] = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]

Now I have the operator matrix [[10, 5], [5, -10]].

For the state vector 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩, I'll express it as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ corresponds to [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ to [0, 1]^T, the state vector |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1, 0]^T + (√3)/2 * [0, 1]^T = [0.5, (√3)/2]^T

To find the expectation value, I need to compute ⟨ψ|(10σ_z + 5σ_x)|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, to calculate the expectation value of 10σ_z + 5σ_x, I could split it...

# OpenAI completion

Sure, here's the rephrased version:

Alright, I need to calculate the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x for a spin-half particle in the quantum state 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Let's begin by considering what an expectation value entails. The expectation value of an operator represents the average outcome you would anticipate if you repeatedly measured that observable on systems prepared in an identical state. The formula to determine the expectation value of an operator A, in relation to a state |ψ⟩, is ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩.

In this scenario, the operator is a combination of σ_z and σ_x. I understand that σ_z and σ_x refer to the Pauli matrices. It's helpful to list them down for clarity. Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates of σ_z are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which can be expressed as column vectors. Specifically, σ_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues of +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

On the other hand, σ_x is the off-diagonal Pauli matrix. These matrices are given by:

σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]  
σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

Let me compute the operator 10σ_z + 5σ_x by working through the components. First, I'll multiply each matrix by the respective coefficients and then sum them:

10σ_z = 10*[[1, 0], [0, -1]] = [[10, 0], [0, -10]]  
5σ_x = 5*[[0, 1], [1, 0]] = [[0, 5], [5, 0]]

Adding the matrices results in:

10σ_z + 5σ_x = [[10+0, 0+5], [0+5, -10+0]] = [[10, 5], [5, -10]]

Thus, the operator matrix becomes [[10, 5], [5, -10]].

The state vector is described as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's express this as a column vector. Considering |↑⟩ corresponds to [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ corresponds to [0, 1]^T, the state vector |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = 0.5 * [1; 0] + (√3)/2 * [0; 1] = [0.5; (√3)/2]

To determine the expectation value, I need to evaluate ⟨ψ| (10σ_z + 5σ_x) |ψ⟩.

For a spin state, probably ⟨σ_z⟩ is the probability of spin-up minus probability of spin-down, right?\n\nSince σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So ⟨σ_z⟩ = |⟨↑|ψ⟩|^2 * 1 + |⟨↓|ψ⟩|^2 * (-1). Indeed, that\'s the expectation value.\n\nSimilarly, ⟨σ_x⟩ would be a bit different because σ_x has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But maybe instead of trying to think in terms of probabilities, let\'s do the matrix multiplication.\n\nFirst, let\'s compute ⟨σ_z⟩. The state vector is [0.5; (√3)/2], so the adjoint (bra) is [0.5, (√3)/2].\n\nCompute ⟨σ_z⟩:\n\n⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5; (√3)/2]\n\nMultiplying the matrices step by step.

Let\'s compute ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩:\n\nFirst, σ_x|ψ〉 is [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; √3/2] = [√3/2; 0.5]\n\nThen, inner product with ⟨ψ|:\n\n[0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866...\n\nWait, express that symbolically: √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So √3 is about 1.732, so 1.732/2 is approximately 0.866.\n\nTherefore, ⟨σ_x⟩= √3/2 ≈ 0.866\n\nWait, but exact value is √3/2.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of the entire operator 10σ_z +5σ_x is:\n\n10*(⟨σ_z⟩) +5*(⟨σ_x⟩) = 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2\n\nWait, to compute numerically, √3≈1.732. So substitute:\n\n-5 + (5*1.732)/2 ≈ -5 + (8.66)/2 ≈ -5 +4.33≈-0.666...\n\nSo the expectation value is approximately -0.666..., which up to one decimal place is -0.7. Let\'s check.\n\nAlternatively, let me verify my steps. Let\'s compute 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩:\n\nWe found ⟨σ_z⟩ = -0.5 and ⟨σ_x⟩ = √3/2. So exact value is:\n\n10*(-1/2) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2. So exact value is -5 + (5√3)/2.\n\nCalculating this numerically:\n\n(5√3)/2 ≈ (5*1.732)/2 ≈ 8.66/2 =4.33\n\nThen subtract 5: 4.33 -5= -0.666...\n\nSo yes, approximately -0.666..., which to one decimal place is -0.7. \n\nBut maybe the question wants the answer to one decimal place. So rounding -0.666... to one decimal place, it\'s -0.7. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact value is more precise. Let me check the exact calculation again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check.\n\n⟨σ_z⟩ was computed as:\n\n[0.5, √3/2] * [0.5; -√3/2] = 0.25 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-sqrt(3)/2). The second term is -3/4. Indeed 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct.\n\nFor ⟨σ_x⟩:\n\n[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. Correct.\n\nSo compute 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ -5 + (5*1.732)/2≈-5 +8.66/2≈-5 +4.33≈-0.67. Hence, ≈ -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. \n\nAlternatively, in the problem statement, maybe the question requires to more precisely compute, perhaps with closer approximation. Let\'s compute (5 sqrt(3))/2 with more precise sqrt(3) ≈ 1.7320508075688772...\n\nSo 5*1.7320508075688772≈8.660254037844386; divided by 2:4.330127018922193; Then subtract 5: 4.330127018922193 -5 = -0.6698729810778068... So approximately -0.66987..., which is approximately -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, this is -0.7.\n\nAlternatively, if the instructions say to "round to one decimal place," then -0.67 rounds to -0.7. Because the second decimal is 6 which is ≥5, so you round up the first decimal from 6 to 7. So yes, -0.7.\n\nBut let me confirm. Another approach: Let\'s compute the expectation value using the matrix multiplication directly, just to check.\n\nOperator matrix is [[10,5],[5,-10]], and the state vector is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we start by calculating the expectation values of \(\sigma_z\) and \(\sigma_x\) separately and then use linearity to combine the results.

1. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_z\):**
   The state vector is \(|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\). The expectation value of \(\sigma_z\) is:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot 1 + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 \cdot 1 + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
   \]

2. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_x\):**
   The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_x\) in the computational basis is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\). The application of \(\sigma_x\) on \(|\psi\rangle\) gives:
   \[
   \sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   The expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]

3. **Combining the results:**
   Using linearity of the expectation value:
   \[
   \langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -5 + \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]
   Approximating \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\):
   \[
   \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx \frac{5 \cdot 1.732}{2} \approx 4.33
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
   \]
   Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is \(-0.7\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

oparts since expectation is linear. That is:

⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩ = 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩

Maybe that's an easier way. Let me check. Calculate ⟨σ_z⟩ and ⟨σ_x⟩ separately and then add them appropriately. For a spin state, probably ⟨σ_z⟩ is the probability of spin-up minus probability of spin-down, right?

Since σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So ⟨σ_z⟩ = |⟨↑|ψ⟩|^2 * 1 + |⟨↓|ψ⟩|^2 * (-1). Indeed, that's the expectation value.

Similarly, ⟨σ_x⟩ would be a bit different because σ_x has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But maybe instead of trying to think in terms of probabilities, let's do the matrix multiplication.

First, let's compute ⟨σ_z⟩. The state vector is [0.5; (√3)/2], so the adjoint (bra) is [0.5, (√3)/2].

Compute ⟨σ_z⟩:

⟨ψ|σ_z|ψ⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2] * [[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5; (√3)/2]

Multiplying the matrices step by step. First, compute σ_z times |ψ⟩:

[[1, 0], [0, -1]] * [0.5; (√3)/2] = [1*0.5 + 0*(√3)/2; 0*0.5 + (-1)*(√3)/2] = [0.5; -√3/2]

Then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|:

[0.5, √3/2] * [0.5; -√3/2] = 0.5*0.5 + (√3)/2*(-√3/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5

So ⟨σ_z⟩ = -0.5

Now, compute ⟨σ_x⟩:

Same approach, but σ_x is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Let's compute ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩:

First, σ_x|ψ〉 is [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; √3/2] = [√3/2; 0.5]

Then, inner product with ⟨ψ|:

[0.5, √3/2] * [√3/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*0.5 = (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866...

Wait, express that symbolically: √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So √3 is about 1.732, so 1.732/2 is approximately 0.866.

Therefore, ⟨σ_x⟩= √3/2 ≈ 0.866

Wait, but exact value is √3/2.

Therefore, the expectation value of the entire operator 10σ_z +5σ_x is:

10*(⟨σ_z⟩) +5*(⟨σ_x⟩) = 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2

Wait, to compute numerically, √3≈1.732. So substitute:

-5 + (5*1.732)/2 ≈ -5 + (8.66)/2 ≈ -5 +4.33≈-0.666...

So the expectation value is approximately -0.666..., which up to one decimal place is -0.7. Let's check.

Alternatively, let me verify my steps. Let's compute 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩:

We found ⟨σ_z⟩ = -0.5 and ⟨σ_x⟩ = √3/2. So exact value is:

10*(-1/2) + 5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2. So exact value is -5 + (5√3)/2.

Calculating this numerically:

(5√3)/2 ≈ (5*1.732)/2 ≈ 8.66/2 =4.33

Then subtract 5: 4.33 -5= -0.666...

So yes, approximately -0.666..., which to one decimal place is -0.7. 

But maybe the question wants the answer to one decimal place. So rounding -0.666... to one decimal place, it's -0.7. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the exact value is more precise. Let me check the exact calculation again.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check.

⟨σ_z⟩ was computed as:

[0.5, √3/2] * [0.5; -√3/2] = 0.25 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-sqrt(3)/2). The second term is -3/4. Indeed 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct.

For ⟨σ_x⟩:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5] = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. Correct.

So compute 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ -5 + (5*1.732)/2≈-5 +8.66/2≈-5 +4.33≈-0.67. Hence, ≈ -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. 

Alternatively, in the problem statement, maybe the question requires to more precisely compute, perhaps with closer approximation. Let's compute (5 sqrt(3))/2 with more precise sqrt(3) ≈ 1.7320508075688772...

So 5*1.7320508075688772≈8.660254037844386; divided by 2:4.330127018922193; Then subtract 5: 4.330127018922193 -5 = -0.6698729810778068... So approximately -0.66987..., which is approximately -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, this is -0.7.

Alternatively, if the instructions say to "round to one decimal place," then -0.67 rounds to -0.7. Because the second decimal is 6 which is ≥5, so you round up the first decimal from 6 to 7. So yes, -0.7.

But let me confirm. Another approach: Let's compute the expectation value using the matrix multiplication directly, just to check.

Operator matrix is [[10,5],[5,-10]], and the state vector is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Compute the expectation value as ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * A * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], where A is the matrix.

First compute A*|ψ⟩:

First element:10*0.5 +5*(sqrt(3)/2)=5 + (5sqrt(3))/2≈5 +4.330=9.330

Second element:5*0.5 + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2)=2.5 -5sqrt(3)≈2.5 -8.660≈-6.160

Now take inner product with [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]:

0.5*9.330 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-6.160)

Compute first term: 0.5*9.330≈4.665

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2)*(-6.160)≈(1.732/2)*-6.160≈0.866*(-6.160)≈-5.331

Add them together:4.665 -5.331≈-0.666, so again ≈-0.666, which confirms the -0.7 result.

Alternatively, in the exact symbolic calculation:

[0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[10,5],[5,-10]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = 0.5*10*0.5 +0.5*5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*5*0.5 + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-10)*(sqrt(3)/2)

Compute each term:

Term1:0.5*10*0.5 = (0.5*10)=5, then *0.5=2.5

Term2:0.5*5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (2.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (2.5sqrt(3))/2

Term3:(sqrt(3)/2)*5*0.5 = same as term2: (2.5sqrt(3))/2 

Term4:(sqrt(3)/2)*(-10)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (-10)*(3/4) = (-10)*0.75 = -7.5

So sum all terms: 2.5 + [2.5sqrt(3)/2 +2.5sqrt(3)/2 ] -7.5 = 2.5 + (5sqrt(3)/2) -7.5 = (5sqrt(3)/2) -5

Which equals exactly the same expression as before: (5sqrt(3))/2 -5, which again is approximately -0.666...

So, yes, expectation value is (5sqrt(3)/2 -5) ≈-0.666..., which rounds to -0.7. 

Therefore, the expectation value up to one decimal place is -0.7. So should the answer be \boxed{-0.7}?

But let me check again if the question mentions "spin-up and spin-down states" with coefficients 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Wait, 0.5 is a coefficient for |↑⟩. Let's confirm that the state is normalized. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1 for a normalized state.

Compute (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 =0.25 + (3/4)=1. So yes, it's indeed normalized. Good. So the state is properly normalized. So our expectation value is correctly calculated.

Another way to think: Maybe we can express the operator in terms of components. Maybe parametrize using some variables. But given that the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of σ_z, maybe calculating ⟨σ_z⟩ is straightforward. Similarly, for σ_x, which is an off-diagonal element, but the calculation we did earlier using the matrix multiplication confirmed things. As an sanity check, for σ_x = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|, so expectation value ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ is equal to product of coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ (since ⟨ψ|↑⟩⟨↓|ψ⟩ = c_up^* c_down + c_down^* c_up ) which would be 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = sqrt(3)/2. So that is consistent with the earlier result.

Okay, so this seems correct.

Thus, reiterating:

⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩ =10*(-0.5)+5*(sqrt(3)/2)= -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2≈-5 +4.330≈-0.67≈-0.7 (to one decimal place)

Hence, the answer is \boxed{-0.7}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-0.7}

This might be simpler because computing each constituent separately is straightforward.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nYes, operator expectation values are linear. Therefore, the expectation value of 10σ_z +5σ_x is indeed 10 times the expectation value of σ_z in the state plus 5 times the expectation value of σ_x in the state.\n\nNow, computing ⟨σ_z⟩ first. The eigenstates of σ_z are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Since my state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. The expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is probability amplitude squared for |↑⟩ minus probability amplitude squared for |↓⟩ because σ_z has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.\n\nBut wait:\n\nWait, alternatively, since the state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then:\n\n⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|^2*(1) + |b|^2*(-1) = |a|^2 - |b|^2\n\nSimilarly for⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩.

Given the coefficients a and b:\n\n|ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, here a = 0.5 and b = (√3)/2\n\nSo the expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is |a|^2 - |b|^2 = (0.25) - (3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5\n\nFor ⟨σ_x⟩, since σ_x is the Pauli-x matrix, the formula for expectation value is:\n\n⟨σ_x⟩ = a b* + a* b. But since in our case, are the coefficients a and b real numbers? Since 0.5 and √3/2 (≈0.866) are real.\n\nIf a and b are real, then ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2ab.

Rounded to one decimal place would be -0.7.\n\nThus, it checks out with the linearity approach. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.\n\nAlternatively, let's write the exact terms symbolically for higher precision.\n\nGiven:\n\na = 0.5, b = √3/2\n\n⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|^2 - |b|^2 = (0.5)^2 - (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 - 3/4 = -0.5.\n\n⟨σ_x⟩ = 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(√3/2) = (√3)/2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nExpectation value =10*(-1/2)+5*(√3/2)= -5 + (5√3)/2.\n\nCompute (5√3)/2:\n\nSince √3≈1.732, so (5*1.732)/2≈8.66/2≈4.33.\n\nThus, -5 +4.33≈-0.67, rounding to -0.7.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute using components or using linearity, I get the same answer of about -0.7. Then, according to the instruction, to one decimal place, so -0.7 is adequate. Therefore, the expectation value is -0.7, in decimal. I think that's it.\n\nBut I want to check one thing.

To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we can use the linearity of expectation values. 

First, we calculate the expectation values of \(\sigma_z\) and \(\sigma_x\) separately.

1. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_z\):**
   \[
   \langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2 - |b|^2
   \]
   where \(a = 0.5\) and \(b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting these values:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
   \]

2. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_x\):**
   \[
   \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab
   \]
   Substituting \(a = 0.5\) and \(b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\):
   \[
   \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2 \times 0.5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
   \]

3. **Combine the results using linearity:**
   \[
   \langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
   \]
   Substituting the calculated values:
   \[
   \langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -5 + \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]

Approximating \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\):
   \[
   \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx \frac{5 \times 1.732}{2} \approx 4.33
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
   \]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is:
\[
\boxed{-0.7}
\]

 wait, Maybe first compute each expectation value for σ_z and σ_x separately and then combine them multiplied by their coefficients if linearity applies. Since expectation values are linear, ⟨A + B⟩ = ⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩, so the expectation value of 10σ_z + 5σ_x should be 10⟨σ_z⟩ + 5⟨σ_x⟩. This might be simpler because computing each constituent separately is straightforward.

Let me confirm:

Yes, operator expectation values are linear. Therefore, the expectation value of 10σ_z +5σ_x is indeed 10 times the expectation value of σ_z in the state plus 5 times the expectation value of σ_x in the state.

Now, computing ⟨σ_z⟩ first. The eigenstates of σ_z are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Since my state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. The expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is probability amplitude squared for |↑⟩ minus probability amplitude squared for |↓⟩ because σ_z has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

But wait:

Wait, alternatively, since the state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, then:

⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|^2*(1) + |b|^2*(-1) = |a|^2 - |b|^2

Similarly for⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩. However, σ_x in the σ_z basis has expectation value a b* + a* b because of σ_x being the off-diagonal matrix. Let me confirm:

Actually, let's represent the state and compute those.

First compute ⟨σ_z⟩. Given the coefficients a and b:

|ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, here a = 0.5 and b = (√3)/2

So the expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is |a|^2 - |b|^2 = (0.25) - (3/4) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5

For ⟨σ_x⟩, since σ_x is the Pauli-x matrix, the formula for expectation value is:

⟨σ_x⟩ = a b* + a* b. But since in our case, are the coefficients a and b real numbers? Since 0.5 and √3/2 (≈0.866) are real.

If a and b are real, then ⟨σ_x⟩ = 2ab. So, here, a = 0.5 and b ≈0.866,

⟨σ_x⟩ = 2 * 0.5 * (√3)/2 = (√3)/2 ≈0.866

Hence, the overall expectation value:

10 * ⟨σ_z⟩ +5 * ⟨σ_x⟩ ≈ 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2) ≈ -5 + 5*(0.866)≈ -5 +4.330≈ -0.670. Rounded to one decimal place, this is approximately -0.7.

But I should verify this by explicit calculation, just to be sure.

Alternatively, let's verify by matrix multiplication.

Given the operator 10σ_z +5σ_x as a 2x2 matrix:

[[10,5],[5,-10]]

and the state vector written as a column vector [0.5; √3/2]. Let's compute (10σ_z +5σ_x)|ψ⟩

= [[10,5],[5,-10]] * [0.5, √3/2]^T

So multiplying,

First component:

10*(0.5) +5*(√3/2) = 5 + (5√3)/2 ≈5 +4.330 ≈9.33

Second component:

5*(0.5) + (-10)*(√3/2) =2.5 -5√3 ≈2.5 -8.660≈ -6.16

Then the dot product with ⟨ψ|, which is [0.5, √3/2], gives:

0.5*(9.33) + (√3/2)*(-6.16)

Compute each term:

First term:9.33*0.5≈4.665

Second term: Let's express √3/2≈0.866

But this is multiplied by -6.16, so:

0.866*(-6.16)≈-5.334

Adding 4.665 + (-5.334)≈-0.669. Rounded to one decimal place would be -0.7.

Thus, it checks out with the linearity approach. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.

Alternatively, let's write the exact terms symbolically for higher precision.

Given:

a = 0.5, b = √3/2

⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|^2 - |b|^2 = (0.5)^2 - (√3/2)^2 = 0.25 - 3/4 = -0.5.

⟨σ_x⟩ = 2ab = 2*(0.5)*(√3/2) = (√3)/2.

Therefore,

Expectation value =10*(-1/2)+5*(√3/2)= -5 + (5√3)/2.

Compute (5√3)/2:

Since √3≈1.732, so (5*1.732)/2≈8.66/2≈4.33.

Thus, -5 +4.33≈-0.67, rounding to -0.7.

Therefore, whether I compute using components or using linearity, I get the same answer of about -0.7. Then, according to the instruction, to one decimal place, so -0.7 is adequate. Therefore, the expectation value is -0.7, in decimal. I think that's it.

But I want to check one thing. Because σ_x is defined with off-diagonal entries, the calculations can confuse if not done correctly. Let's present the exact symbolic expressions.

Express the expectation values again symbolically.

⟨σ_z⟩ = |a|² - |b|² = (0.5)² - (sqrt{3}/2)^2.

Is this correct?

Yes, because for |↑> the eigenvalue is +1, so |a|² *1, and for |↓> it's -1, so |b|²*(-1).

Therefore, this equals 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct.

For σ_x, Pauli matrix:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]

Thus, the expectation value is [a* b*]σ_x [a; b] = complex conjugate of first component times 1 times second component, plus etc.

Wait—typical notation in QM is that states can be written as column vectors. The expectation value is ⟨ψ|σ_x |ψ⟩, so you first apply σ_x to |ψ⟩, then multiply from left with ⟨ψ|.

Alternatively:

⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩. Here the components are real, so transpose.

So let's consider:

|ψ⟩ = [a, b]^T = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T

σ_x|ψ> = [[0,1],[1,0]] [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T

Then ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ]^T = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) )

= 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5

= 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2

Hey, except we have coefficients in the original state; okay that is exactly equal to the 2ab cross term, given that a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. So, once again: expect that the calculation is correct.

Same as σ_x, preceded here. So  σ_x gives as ⟨ψ|σ_x|ψ⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Then 10sigma_z +5sigma_x's expectation is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2)= -5 + (5/2)*sqrt(3). Let's compute (5/2)*sqrt(3).

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 1.732 *5=8.66, divided by 2=4.33. Then -5 +4.33= approximately-0.67, which when rounding to one decimal place is -0.7.

So everything checks out, both through explicit multiplication step by step and through calculating component operators. Therefore, I conclude that the answer is -0.7. But, maybe to write it as \boxed{-0.7}

Is there a chance of miscalculation? Let me verify numerical calculation.

Wait, numerical value of sqrt(3)/2 is ~0.866. 0.866 *5 ~~4.33. Hmm.

Hmm. So then -5 + 4.33= -0.67; yes, ~-0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. All right.

But let me check the expectation value again symbolically. Let's plug in exact terms.

Let a=1/2, b= sqrt(3)/2.

⟨10σ_z +5σ_x⟩ =10(a² - b²) +5(2ab) =10*((1/2)^2 - (sqrt(3)/2)^2) +5*(2*(1/2)*(sqrt(3)/2))

Compute:

(1/2)^2 =1/4=0.25

(sqrt(3)/2)^2=3/4=0.75

Thus,

10*(0.25 -0.75)=10*(-0.5)= -5

Now the σ_x term:

2ab=2*(1/2)*(sqrt(3)/2)= (sqrt(3))/2

Multiplying by 5, 5*(sqrt(3)/2)= (5/2)*sqrt(3)

Hence total:

-5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2

Again,( (5*(1.732) ) /2)= (8.66)/2=4.33. So -5 +4.33=-0.67, which is approximately -0.7.

Yes, confirming again.

Thus, the answer is \boxed{-0.7}

**Final Answer**
The expectation value of the operator is \boxed{-0.7}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for the spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we can break down the calculation into steps involving the expectation values of \(\sigma_z\) and \(\sigma_x\) separately.

1. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_z\):**
   - The eigenstates of \(\sigma_z\) are \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and \(|\downarrow\rangle\) with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.
   - The state vector is \(|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 This involves multiplying the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩ (which is ⟨ψ|) with the operator matrix, and then the result with |ψ⟩. Since the coefficients here are real, ⟨ψ| is simply the transpose of |ψ⟩: [0.5, (√3)/2].

So, first compute the product ⟨ψ| (10σ_z + 5σ_x):

⟨ψ| = [0.5, (√3)/2]

Multiplying this row vector with the matrix [[10, 5], [5, -10]]:

First component of the resulting row vector:

0.5*10 + (√3)/2*5 = 5 + (5√3)/2

Second component:

0.5*5 + (√3)/2*(-10) = 2.5 - 5√3

Now, the next step is to multiply this result with the column vector |ψ⟩:

[5 + (5√3)/2, 2.5 - 5√3] * [0.5; (√3)/2] 

Calculating each term:

First element multiplied by 0.5:

[5 + (5√3)/2] * 0.5 = (5*0.5) + [(5√3)/2 * 0.5] = 2.5 + (5√3)/4

Second element multiplied by (√3)/2:

[2.5 - 5√3] * (√3)/2 = 2.5*(√3)/2 - 5√3*(√3)/2

Let me compute each part:

2.5*(√3)/2 = (5/2)*(√3)/2 = (5√3)/4

5√3*(√3)/2 = 5*(3)/2 = 15/2

Thus, the second term becomes (5√3)/4 - 15/2

Adding both terms:

2.5 + (5√3)/4 + (5√3)/4 - 15/2

Combine like terms:

The terms with √3: (5√3)/4 + (5√3)/4 = (10√3)/4 = (5√3)/2 ≈ (5*1.732)/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈ 4.33

The constant terms: 2.5 - 15/2 = 2.5 - 7.5 = -5

So total expectation value is ≈ 4.33 -5 ≈ -0.67

Rounding to one decimal place gives approximately -0.7

Wait, but maybe this approximation introduced some error. Let me try to compute it more precisely without approximating √3 early on.

Alternatively, perhaps to handle it more accurately, let's compute algebraically first.

Express the expectation value formula:

⟨ψ| (10σ_z +5σ_x) |ψ⟩

Go back to the components of |ψ⟩ and the operator.

The state |ψ⟩ is given as [0.5; (√3)/2]. As a standard procedure, expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ and ⟨σ_x⟩ can be calculated separately and then multiplied by their coefficients (10 and 5) because expectation values are linear.

So instead of dealing with the combined operator, perhaps calculate each expectation value individually.

This approach might simplify computation.

First, compute ⟨σ_z⟩. Since σ_z is diagonal, the expectation value is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues (1 and -1) based on the squared amplitudes of the state components.

Therefore, ⟨σ_z⟩ = |0.5|² * 1 + |(√3)/2|² * (-1)

The squared amplitudes are (0.5)^2 = 0.25 and ((√3)/2)^2 = (3)/4 = 0.75.

Therefore:

⟨σ_z⟩ = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5

Next, compute ⟨σ_x⟩. The Pauli σ_x matrix has off-diagonal elements. The formula for ⟨σ_x⟩ is ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩.

σ_x swaps the components and adds them, so:

⟨σ_x⟩ = [0.5, (√3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; (√3)/2]

Multiplying out step by step, first the matrix times vector:

σ_x |ψ⟩ = [ (0*0.5 +1*(√3)/2 ), (1*0.5 +0*(√3)/2 ) ] = [ (√3)/2, 0.5 ]

Then the dot product with ⟨ψ| is:

0.5 * (√3)/2 + (√3)/2 * 0.5

= 2 * [0.5 * (√3)/2] = 2 * [ (√3)/4 ] = √3/2 ≈ 0.866

So, ⟨σ_x⟩ = √3/2 ≈ 0.866

Hence, the total expectation value is 10 * ⟨σ_z⟩ + 5 * ⟨σ_x⟩ = 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2) = -5 + (5√3)/2

Compute (5√3)/2:

First, approximate √3 ≈1.732 so:

(5*1.732)/2 ≈8.66/2 ≈4.33

Hence, -5 +4.33 ≈ -0.67

Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7.

Therefore, the value is approximately -0.7.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires an exact answer first before approximation.

Expressed exactly, it's -5 + (5√3)/2.

But since the question specifies up to one decimal place, rounding is needed.

Interestingly, when I previously calculated using matrices, the same result popped up. That's comforting, as cross methods arriving at the same answer is a good consistency check.

Another way: using matrix multiplication directly.

Given the operator matrix [[10,5],[5,-10]] and the state vector [0.5; (√3)/2].

Then, first compute the matrix-vector product of the operator with |ψ⟩:

10*0.5 +5*(√3)/2 and 5*0.5 +(-10)*(√3)/2.

Which gives first element: 5 + (5√3)/2 and the second element: 2.5 -5√3.

Then the expectation value is [0.5; (√3)/2]^T · [5 +5√3/2; 2.5 -5√3], which again leads to:

0.5*(5 +5√3/2) + (√3)/2*(2.5 -5√3)

Calculating term-wise:

First term: 0.5*5 =2.5 and 0.5*(5√3)/2= (5√3)/4

Second term: (√3)/2*2.5 = (2.5√3)/2 = (5√3)/4 and (√3)/2*(-5√3) = (-5*3)/2 = -15/2

So summing all:

2.5 + (5√3)/4 + (5√3)/4 -15/2

Combine the √3 terms: 10√3/4=5√3/2

The constants: 2.5 -7.5= -5

So total is 5√3/2 -5

Same as before, indeed.

Compute 5√3≈5*1.732≈8.66, half of that is 4.33, hence 4.33 -5= -0.67≈ -0.7.

So whether I approach it by splitting into σ_z and σ_x parts or directly calculate, the result is same.

So answer is \boxed{-0.7}

Just to confirm the key steps once more, perhaps swiftly. The expectation value of σ_z is -0.5 and σ_x is √3/2≈0.866. Then 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2)= -5 +4.33=-0.67≈-0.7 is correct.

Yes, confident with that.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-0.7}
