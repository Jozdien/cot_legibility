# Original Question

Two stars (Star_1 and Star_2) each have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of our Sun, respectively. Assuming LTE and using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances of these two stars: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Consider the following photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

Given the elemental abundances of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, we need to calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: The iron abundance relative to hydrogen is solar, so \( \left( \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_1 = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\odot} \).
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: The silicon abundance relative to iron is \( \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}} \right)_1 = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}} \right)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3} \).
   - Therefore, \( \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_1 = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}} \right)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3} \times \left( \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\odot} = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3} \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: The magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is solar, so \( \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_2 = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\odot} \).
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: The magnesium abundance relative to silicon is \( \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}} \right)_2 = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}} \right)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3} \).
   - Therefore, \( \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_2 = \frac{\left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_2}{\left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}} \right)_2} = \frac{\left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\odot}}{\left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}} \right)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3}} = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\odot} \times 10^{-0.3} \).

3. **Ratio Calculation**:
   - The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:
     \[
     \frac{\left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_1}{\left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_2} = \frac{\left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3}}{\left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\odot} \times 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6}
     \]

### Final Answer
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is \boxed{10^{0.6}}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Let's take it step by step. First, let's make sure I understand all the given information.

The stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the problem says Star_1 is 1.5 and Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. But maybe the mass isn't directly needed here because we're given the abundances through various [X/Y] values. Since the problem is about photospheric abundances, maybe the masses are red herrings? Or maybe they relate to stellar evolution effects, but the question states to assume LTE and uses equivalent width method, which are analysis techniques assuming we can derive abundances from spectra. So maybe the masses don't affect the abundance calculations here. Let me keep that in mind but maybe proceed with the given abundances.

Given:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Solar photospheric composition:

- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

We need to find (nSi_1)/(nSi_2), the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2.

First, some definitions. The notation [A/B] means log10(nA/nB) - log10(nA/nB)_sun. So [A/B] = log10((nA/nB)/(nA/nB)_sun). Therefore, (nA/nB) = (nA/nB)_sun * 10^[A/B].

Similarly, [A/H] is log10(nA/nH) - log10(nA/nH)_sun. So (nA/nH) = (nA/nH)_sun * 10^[A/H].

For Star_1:

- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So their iron abundance relative to hydrogen is solar. So (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

But wait, given solar 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So for the Sun, log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Similarly for Mg, log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7 -12 = -5.

So the actual number ratio for the Sun: nFe/nH = 10^-4.5, and nMgnH = 10^-5.

But maybe we don't need to calculate the absolute values, just ratios relative to the Sun. Hmm.

But let's see. For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. Therefore, log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe/nH)_sun.

Which means (nFe/nH)_1 = 10^{log(nFe/nH)_sun} = (nFe/nH)_sun. So same as solar for Fe in Star_1.

Given Star_1's [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

Therefore, (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3}.

We can calculate (nSi/nFe)_sun. Wait, (nSi/nFe)_sun is (nSi/nH / nFe/nH) for the sun. Because (nSi/nFe) = (nSi/nH) / (nFe/nH). So:

log(nSi/nFe)_sun = log(nSi/nH) - log(nFe/nH).

But what is log(nSi/nH)_sun? Wait, we don't have the solar Si abundance given here. Wait, the problem gives solar Fe and Mg, but not Si. Wait wait, hold on. Wait the problem states "photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7."

Ah. So we have solar Fe and Mg abundances. But Si is not provided. Hmm. Is that a problem? Since [Si/Fe] is given for Star_1, and [Mg/Si] for Star_2, and for Star_2, [Mg/H] is given, but perhaps we can link them through the different elements.

Wait, this seems important. How can I compute (nSi/nFe)_sun? Since I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe], but perhaps if I need (nSi_1)/(nSi_2), maybe things will cancel out.

Let me start with Star_1 first.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3: So (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.

Therefore, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3 * (nFe/nH)_sun.

But (nFe/nH)_sun is given as 10^{7.5 -12} = 10^{-4.5}, but since Star_1's Fe/H is solar, (nFe/nH)_1 = 10^{-4.5} as well. Then (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3} * 10^{-4.5}.

But this still requires me to know (nSi/nFe)_sun, which I can't compute directly because I don't have the solar Si abundance. Wait, maybe not. Let me note that (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun. Similarly, log(nSi/nH)_sun we could solve if needed, but I realize the problem doesn't provide the solar Si abundance.

Hmm. Is there a way around this? Maybe.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 =0. So (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun = 10^{-5} (since 12 + log(nMg/nH) for the sun is 7, so log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12= -5, so 10^{-5}).

And Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So [Mg/Si]_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun =0.3.

Thus: log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_sun +0.3

So, (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun *10^{0.3).

Then since (nMg/nH)_2 = nmg_2/nH_2 = 10^{-5} (because [Mg/H]=0), so (nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_2

Wait, (nMg/nSi)_2 is (nmg_2/nSi_2) = (nmg_2/nH_2) * (nH_2/nSi_2) = (nmg/nH)_2 / (nSi/nH)_2). So rearranged, (nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_2.

But (nMg/nH)_2 is known (10^{-5}).

Also (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun *10^{0.3}

Now, (nMg/nSi)_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun = 10^{-5}/(nSi/nH)_sun.

Therefore:

(nSi/nH)_2 = (10^{-5}) / [ (10^{-5}/(nSi/nH)_sun ) * 10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

nSi/nH for Star_2 is equal to (10^{-5}) divided by [10^{-5}/(nSi/nH)_sun *10^{0.3}]. That is nSi/nH_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun /10^{0.3}.

So (nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun *10^{-0.3}

But for Star1, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun *10^{0.3} *10^{-4.5}

But we need to compute (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2

Which is [(nSi/nFe)_sun *10^{0.3} *10^{-4.5} ] / [ (nSi/nHsun *10^{-0.3} ) ]

Hmm. There must be a connection.

Wait, (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun.

But (nFe/nH)_sun is 10^{-4.5}, (nSi/nH)_sun we can denote as x (since not provided), so (nSi/nFe)_sun = x /10^{-4.5}

So in terms of x:

(nSi/nH)_1 = (x /10^{-4.5}) *10^{0.3} * 10^{-4.5} )

Which is x /10^{-4.5} *10^{0.3}*10^{-4.5}=x*10^{0.3}/10^{-4.5 + (-4.5)} } Wait, no.

Wait, (nSi/nFe)_sun is x / a, where a is 10^{-4.5}.

Then So (nSi/nFe)_sun *10^{0.3} * (nFe/nH)_sun:  So (x /10^{-4.5}) *10^{0.3} *10^{-4.5} = x*10^{0.3}

Therefore, (nSi/nH)_1 =x *10^{0.3}

But (nSi/nH)_2 =x *10^{-0.3}

Thus, the ratio (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 = [10^{0.3}x] / [10^{-0.3}x] =10^{0.6} ≈3.98 ≈4.

But the answer would be approximately 4. So the silicon ratio is 10^{0.6} which is approximately 4:1.

Hence, the silicon abundance ratio of Star_1 to Star_2 is about 10^{0.6}, or about 3.98. But since the problem requires the exact ratio, not an approximate decimal, we need to use logarithmic values.

Wait, but let's check this again step by step with variables.

Let’s define solar abundances:

(nFe/nH)_sun = X =10^{\log(X)}, where log(X) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 => X=10^{-4.5}

(nMg/nH)_sun =Y =10^{\log(Y)}, log(Y)=7-12=-5 => Y=10^{-5}

Solar (nSi/nH)_sun = Z, which is not given explicitly.

But perhaps we don't need to know Z because it will cancel.

Let’s proceed:

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 => (nFe/H)_1 = (nFe/H)_sun = X =10^{-4.5}

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 =>

log(nSi/Fe)_1 - log(nSi/Fe)_sun =0.3

→ log(nSi/Fe)_1 = log(nSi/Fe)_sun +0.3

→ nSi/Fe (Star1) = (nSi/Fe)_sun ×10^{0.3}

But (nSi/Fe)_sun = (nSi/H)_sun / (nFe/H)_sun = Z / X

Therefore,

nSi/Fe (Star1) = (Z/X) ×10^{0.3}

But in Star1, (nFe/H)_1 =X, so (nSi/H)_1 =nSi/Fe (Star1) ×Fe/H (Star1)= (Z/X ×10^{0.3}) ×X = Z ×10^{0.3}

Similarly, Star2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 => (nMg/H)_2=Y=10^{-5}

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 => log(nMg/nSi)_2 -log(nMg/nSi)_sun =0.3

→ (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun ×10^{0.3}

But (nMg/nSi)_sun=Y/Z

So (nMg/nSi)_2= Y/Z ×10^{0.3}

But (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/H)_2 / (nSi/H)_2 = Y / (nSi/H)_2

So Y / (nSi/H)_2 )= Y/Z ×10^{0.3}

Cancel Y on both sides: 1/(nSi/H)_2 = (1/Z) ×10^{0.3}

→ (nSi/H)_2= Z ×10^{-0.3}

Now, for Star_1: (nSi/H)_1= Z ×10^{0.3}; for Star2: Z ×10^{-0.3}

Therefore, the ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2)= [nSi/H_1]/[nSi/H_2]= (Z ×10^{0.3})/(Z ×10^{-0.3})=10^{0.6}= approx 3.98. So 10^{0.6}= antilog(0.6)=10^{0.6}.

Indeed, 10^0.6 is 10^(6/10)=10^0.6 = (10^0.3)^2 ~ (2)^2=4, more accurately ~3.98.

But the exact value is 10^{0.6}, so perhaps express the answer as 10^0.6, or if numerical value is required, as approx 3.98. But Wait, the problem doesn't specify how to present the answer. Since it's a ratio, and the answer would be 10^(0.3 - (-0.3))=10^{0.6}

But let me check again:

Because [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3:

Star1’s Si/H is Z*10^{0.3}

Star2’s Si/H is Z*10^{-0.3}

Therefore ratio is (Z*10^{0.3})/(Z*10^{-0.3})=10^{0.6}, no Z involved so solar Si abundance cancels. Perfect!

Thus, the ratio is 10^{0.6}.

Expressed in log is 0.6 dex, as a linear ratio, that's ~3.98, that is approximately 4.

But since in astrophysics exams exact exponentials are often preferred, but maybe the answer has to be just 10^0.6, but often written as 10^{0.6} or exp10(0.6). But the question says "calculate the ratio"—either exact exponential or approximate decimal.

Depending on the user's requirements… the problem says "put your final answer within a box," and as a ratio, sometimes they prefer exact (so 10^{0.6}) but maybe they want the numerical value. But perhaps the answer is 10^{0.6} ≈4, but want the exact exponent. But let me check: 10^{0.6} is exact in logarithm, which would translate to an `antilogarithm` result. Since abundance ratios are commonly expressed as dex (factors of 10^{0.1} etc.), maybe leave it as 10^{0.6} unless requested otherwise. However, in terms of ratio, providing the numerical value is perhaps better, but since we can calculate it, let's verify.

10^{0.6} = e^{0.6 ln10} ≈e^{0.6*2.302585093}≈e^{1.381551}≈3.98. So approximately 4. Since uncertainty often keeps it to one or two decimal places, 3.98 or 4.0. Though acknowledging 0.6 gives 3.98.

But given that in the problem statement the answer just requires the ratio. Let me think again.

Assuming the problem is set up so that we have 0.3 dex and another 0.3 dex, additive. Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 is +0.3, but then [Mg/Si]_2 is +0.3. But how did that end up for Star_2's Si?

The key is that for Star1: the [Si/Fe] is offset.

For Star2: [Mg/Si] is offset.

When calculating [Mg/Si], an increase in [Mg/Si] could mean either Mg is higher or Si is lower.

Given that Star2 has [Mg/H]=0, which is solar. Since [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, that would imply that Mg/Si ratio is higher than solar. As their Mg/H is solar, that must mean Si/H is lower.

So:

Star2's Mg/Si is higher than solar.

But since [Mg/H]=0 => Mg abundance same as sun. So if Mg is same, then Si has to be lower.

Therefore, nMg/nSi = solar (Mg/Si) * 10^0.3. Since Mg is same, that gives nSi = solar Si /10^0.3. Therefore, (nSi/nH)= solar_Si /10^0.3

Similarly, Star1:

[Fe/H]=0, so Fe is solar. [Si/Fe] is +0.3, so Si is enhanced by 0.3 dex compared to solar (with respect to Fe). Since Fe is solar, this means Si is 10^0.3 higher than solar. So comparing to Star2's Si, which is 10^-0.3 solar.

Therefore, Star1_Si / Star2_Si = (10^0.3 solar_Si) / (10^-0.3 solar_Si) =10^0.6 .

Therefore, the ratio is 10^0.6, which is ~4.0.

So yes, answer is 10^{0.6} or approximately 4.0.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is \boxed{10^{0.6}}.

Okay, so I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Let's take it step by step. First, let's make sure I understand all the given information.

The stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the problem says Star_1 is 1.5 and Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. But maybe the mass isn't directly needed here because we're given the abundances through various [X/Y] values. Since the problem is about photospheric abundances, maybe the masses are red herrings? Or maybe they relate to stellar evolution effects, but the question states to assume LTE and uses equivalent width method, which are analysis techniques assuming we can derive abundances from spectra. So maybe the masses don't affect the abundance calculations here. Let me keep that in mind but maybe proceed with the given abundances.

Given:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Solar photospheric composition:

- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

We need to find (nSi_1)/(nSi_2), the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2.

First, some definitions. The notation [A/B] means log10(nA/nB) - log10(nA/nB)_sun. So [A/B] = log10((nA/nB)/(nA/nB)_sun). Therefore, (nA/nB) = (nA/nB)_sun * 10^[A/B].

Similarly, [A/H] is log10(nA/nH) - log10(nA/nH)_sun. So (nA/nH) = (nA/nH)_sun * 10^[A/H].

For Star_1:

- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So their iron abundance relative to hydrogen is solar. So (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

But wait, given solar 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So for the Sun, log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Similarly for Mg, log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7 -12 = -5.

So the actual number ratio for the Sun: nFe/nH = 10^-4.5, and nMgnH = 10^-5.

But maybe we don't need to calculate the absolute values, just ratios relative to the Sun. Hmm.

But let's see. For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. Therefore, log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe/nH)_sun.

Which means (nFe/nH)_1 = 10^{log(nFe/nH)_sun} = (nFe/nH)_sun. So same as solar for Fe in Star_1.

Given Star_1's [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

Therefore, (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3}.

We can calculate (nSi/nFe)_sun. Wait, (nSi/nFe)_sun is (nSi/nH / nFe/nH) for the sun. Because (nSi/nFe) = (nSi/nH) / (nFe/nH). So:

log(nSi/nFe)_sun = log(nSi/nH) - log(nFe/nH).

But what is log(nSi/nH)_sun? Wait, we don't have the solar Si abundance given here. Wait, the problem gives solar Fe and Mg, but not Si. Wait wait, hold on. Wait the problem states "photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7."

Ah. So we

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Let me analyze the provided information systematically.

The stars have masses of 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. However, these masses might not be directly relevant to our calculation of photospheric abundances. The masses could be unrelated details or might relate to stellar evolution effects, but since we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) and using the equivalent width method, these masses may not factor into our abundance calculations.

The problem provides these abundance values:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And for solar photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

We need to find (nSi_1)/(nSi_2).

Let me clarify the notation: [A/B] represents log10(nA/nB) - log10(nA/nB)_sun, which means [A/B] = log10((nA/nB)/(nA/nB)_sun). Therefore, (nA/nB) = (nA/nB)_sun × 10^[A/B].

Similarly, [A/H] equals log10(nA/nH) - log10(nA/nH)_sun, so (nA/nH) = (nA/nH)_sun × 10^[A/H].

For Star_1:
- With [Fe/H]_1 = 0, its iron abundance relative to hydrogen is solar, meaning (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

From the solar values, log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 and log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7 - 12 = -5.

For the Sun, the number ratios are: nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 and nMg/nH = 10^-5.

For Star_1, since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, we have log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0, which means log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun. Therefore, (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun, confirming that Star_1's iron abundance matches solar values.

Given that [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, we have log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3, thus (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun × 10^0.3.

To calculate (nSi/nFe)_sun, we need (nSi/nH)_sun, but the problem doesn't directly provide solar silicon abundance. The solar photospheric composition only gives values for iron and magnesium (12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7).

Sure, here is the rephrased text:

Alright, so I need to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Let's break it down step by step. Initially, I want to ensure I comprehend all the provided information.

The stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, with Star_1 being 1.5 and Star_2 being 1.2 solar masses as per the problem. However, it's possible that the mass isn't directly relevant here since we're given abundance data through various [X/Y] values. Since we're focusing on photospheric abundances, perhaps the masses are distractions, or they might pertain to effects related to stellar evolution. Nonetheless, the question specifies using LTE and the equivalent width method, which are analytical techniques assuming we can derive abundances from spectra. Thus, the masses might not influence the abundance calculations in this context. I'll keep that notion in mind but consider proceeding with the provided abundance data.

Information given:

- For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- For Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- For Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Solar photospheric composition:

- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Our objective is to find the ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2), representing the number of silicon atoms in Star_1 to those in Star_2.

To clarify a few definitions: The notation [A/B] implies log10(nA/nB) - log10(nA/nB)_sun. Thus, [A/B] = log10((nA/nB)/(nA/nB)_sun). Therefore, (nA/nB) = (nA/nB)_sun * 10^[A/B].

Similarly, [A/H] signifies log10(nA/nH) - log10(nA/nH)_sun. Hence, (nA/nH) = (nA/nH)_sun * 10^[A/H].

For Star_1:

- Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0, this means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is solar, so (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

Considering the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5, implying log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. The same calculation for Mg gives log10(nMg/nH)_sun = 7 - 12 = -5.

Thus, for the Sun, the actual number ratios are: nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 and nMg/nH = 10^-5.

However, perhaps we only need the ratios relative to the Sun rather than absolute values. Let’s think it through. For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. Hence, log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe/nH)_sun.

This concludes that (nFe/nH)_1 = 10^{log(nFe/nH)_sun} = (nFe/nH)_sun. Therefore, the iron abundance in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

Star_1’s [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex signifies [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

This implies (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3}.

To determine (nSi/nFe)_sun, note that it's calculated as (nSi/nH / nFe/nH) for the Sun because (nSi/nFe) = (nSi/nH) / (nFe/nH). Therefore:

log(nSi/nFe)_sun = log(nSi/nH) - log(nFe/nH).

However, what's log(nSi/nH)_sun? We haven't been given the solar silicon abundance here. The problem provides solar Fe and Mg abundances but not Si. Hold on, the problem states "photospheric composition for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7." Understanding this is our key task...

Hmm. That seems problematic because we need (nSi/nFe)_sun. Unless we can express the answer in terms of solar Si abundance that might cancel out? Wait, maybe not. The problem requires us to compute the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe we can express nSi for each star in terms of solar abundances. For example, in Star_1:\n\n[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Since (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3}.\n\nBut we know [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.\n\nTherefore, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1 = [(nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3}] * (nFe/nH)_sun.\n\nSimilarly, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3}.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1.\n\nBut (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3}.\n\nAnd (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun * 10^[Fe/H]_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun, since [Fe/H]_1=0.\n\nTherefore, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3} * (nFe/nH)_sun.\n\nBut (nSi/nFe)_sun * (nFe/nH)_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun. Because:\n\n(nSi/nFe) * (nFe/nH) = (nSi/nH). So that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3}.\n\nBut we don\'t know (nSi/nH)_sun. Hmm. However, maybe in Star_2, which has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.\n\nSo for Star_2:\n\n[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Which is log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0.3.\n\nTherefore, (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^{0.3}.\n\nSimilarly, [Mg/H]_2 = 0, which is log(nMg/nH)_2 - log(nMg/nH)_sun = 0. So (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun.\n\nTherefore, let\'s relate (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nH)_2 / (nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_2 = [(nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_2].\n\nBut from [Mg/Si]_2, we have:\n\n(nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^{0.3}\n\nTherefore, (nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun / [(nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^{0.3} ]\n\nBut (nMg/nSi)_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun / [ (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3} ) ] = (nSi/nH)_sun / 10^{0.3}\n\nTherefore, (nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{-0.3}\n\nSo, comparing Star_1 and Star_2\'s silicon abundances:\n\nStar_1: (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3}\n\nStar_2: (nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{-0.3}\n\nTherefore, the ratio (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 = [10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}] = 10^{0.6}.\n\nBut the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres, which is (nSi_1 / nSi_2). Assuming that the hydrogen abundances (nH) are the same for both stars? Wait, not necessarily. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.\n\nWait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun. But we don\'t have any information about [H] in the star. Because [Fe/H] is the ratio of Fe to H, but H could vary, but [Fe/H] is adjusted accordingly.\n\nBut, in reality, when we talk about [X/H], it\'s the metallicity relative to the Sun, meaning that all metals are scaled by the same factor. But H is the dominant element, so usually, when you scale a star\'s metallicity, you can think of it as scaling all metals by a factor while keeping H constant. But depending on the context, sometimes the metallicity is accounted for by the total metal content, but in this problem, we have [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, so their Fe abundance is same as solar, so (Fe/H) = solar, so the same ratio. But to get [Si/Fe] for Star_1, as the problem states, which would be the same as [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1. Wait, perhaps that\'s a way to proceed.\n\nWait, there is a relation between [Si/Fe] and [Si/H], [Fe/H]. Let me clarify the notation.\n\n[A/B] = log(nA/nB) - log(nA/nB)_sun\n\nBut that can also be written as:\n\n[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]\n\nBecause:\n\n[A/H] = log(nA/nH) - log(nA/nH)_sun\n\n[B/H] = log(nB/nH) - log(nB/nH)_sun\n\nThen [A/H] - [B/H] = [log(nA/nH) - log(nA/nH)_sun] - [log(nB/nH) - log(nB/nH)_sun]\n\nWhich is log(nA/nH) - log(nB/nH) - [log(nA/nH)_sun - log(nB/nH)_sun]\n\nWhich is log(nA/nB) - log(nA/nB)_sun = [A/B]\n\nYes. Therefore, [A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]\n\nSo for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1\n\nWe know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 = 0.3\n\nTherefore, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3, meaning log(nSi/nH)_1 - log(nSi/nH)_sun = 0.3. Thus, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3}\n\nFor Star_2: we have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2\n\nWe know [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - 0.3 = -0.3\n\nThus, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3, which implies (nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{-0.3}\n\nTherefore, the ratio of (nSi/nH)_1 to (nSi/nH)_2 is 10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98. \n\nBut the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. If the stars have the same hydrogen abundance as the Sun, then the ratio would be 10^{0.6}. But do they? The problem doesn\'t specify. Since we are given abundances relative to H, but if H itself varies between the stars, then the actual nSi would be scaled by (nH / nH_sun). However, we are not given any information about the hydrogen abundances of the stars. The fact that [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 would indicate that in Star_1, nFe/nH = solar, and in Star_2, nMg/nH = solar. \n\nAssuming that the H abundance in Star_1 and Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. But if that\'s the case, then (nSi)_1/(nSi)_2 = [(nSi/nH)_1 * nH] / [(nSi/nH)_2 * nH] = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.\n\nAlternatively, if hydrogen is scaled as well, perhaps. However, generally, when [X/H] is given, it\'s relative to the solar ratio, so H is considered to be the same unless stated otherwise. So, unless there\'s a reason to suppose Star_1 and Star_2 have different H abundances, we assume they are same as solar. Moreover, since differential abundances are given, composition differences in H are unlikely unless they have different metallicities, but Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0 (so solar), and Star_2\'s [Mg/H] =0. But Star_2\'s metallicity for other elements is unknown. However, without any information about their overall metallicity scaling, we can only proceed under the standard assumption that [X/H] refers to the logarithmic abundance relative to the Sun, without implying any scaling of H.\n\nTherefore, to compute the ratio of nSi_1 / nSi_2 is the same as (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 multiplied by (nH_1 / nH_2). If nH_1 = nH_2 = nH_sun, then it\'s 10^{0.6}. Therefore, the answer would be 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98. \n\nAlternatively, is there a way that hydrogen abundance could play a role here? Let\'s see. For Star_1, [Fe/H] =0: so Fe/H is solar. So if Solar Fe/H is 10^-4.5, their Fe abundance is the same Fe/H as the Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, so their Mg/H is solar.\n\nBut how does H\'s abundance differ? For example, if a star has [Fe/H] =0, then if H is depleted by some factor, but Fe is also depleted by the same factor.\n\nBut no, [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_{sun}. So [Fe/H]=0 implies that the ratio nFe/nH is the same as in the Sun, but this does not say anything about the absolute value of nH. If both nFe and nH are scaled by the same factor, their ratio stays the same. However, without additional information, usually, stars abundances are normalized to H. So if we don\'t have information about H, we generally can’t know the absolute abundances. But in this problem, maybe we need to compare the number ratio nSi_1 to nSi_2 in the photosphere. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is formulated in such a way that each star\'s heavy element abundances are relative to H, so the actual Si abundance in terms of H is:\n\nFor Star_1, (nSi/nH)_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi/nH)_sun\n\nFor Star_2, (nSi/nH)_2 = 10^{-0.3} * (nSi/nH)_sun\n\nTherefore, their ratio is (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 = 10^{0.6}\n\nBut in order to get nSi_1 / nSi_2 = [ (nSi/nH)_1 * nH_1 ] / [ (nSi/nH)_2 * nH_2 ] = (10^{0.6} * nH_1 ) / nH_2\n\nTherefore, unless nH_1 = nH_2, we can\'t know this ratio. But the problem gives [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0, which relates the metallicities. For Star_1, because [Fe/H]=0, Fe abundance is solar, so if H were different, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun), but since [Fe/H]=0, nFe/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun, so nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun). But the abundances for other elements like Si would then depend on their [X/Fe] ratios.\n\nBut perhaps here, the answer is as straightforward as 10^{0.6} because the H scaling would cancel out? Wait, but we don\'t know if H_1 and H_2 are the same. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps if Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, and Star_2 has [Mg/H] = 0, the total metallicity Z relative to H could differ, but as the problem gives only Fe and Mg for each star. So perhaps in Star_1, since [Fe/H] =0, the overall metallicity is similar to the Sun, so H abundance is similar. Similarly, in Star_2 with [Mg/H]=0, if Mg is a proxy for metallicity, then Star_2\'s metallicity would be solar, so H abundance similar as well. Therefore, both stars have solar H abundance, so nH_1 = nH_2 = nH_sun. Hence, (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = 10^{0.6} ≈ 4.\n\nBut thought process: without additional information about hydrogen abundances, we have to assume that their H is the same as the Sun. Otherwise, the problem is underdetermined. So consistent with LTE and EW methods, which determine abundances relative to H, so assume H is same as solar.\n\nBut since the question is from an exam or problem set, the answer is likely 10^0.6 = approx 3.98. Since 0.6 log10 is 3.98, approximately 4. But more precise, 10^0.6.\n\nWait, 10^0.6. Let me compute it. Log10(4)=0.602, so 10^0.6 is about 3.98.\n\nAlternatively, 10^0.6. Let\'s do precise calculation:\n\n0.6 in exponent: 10^0.6 ≈ e^{0.6*2.302585} ≈ e^{1.38155} ≈ 3.98. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is 10^{0.6}, so exact value is 10^0.6, so the answer is 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6. So the ratio is 10^0.6:1.\n\nAlternatively, confirm:\n\nStar_1\'s [Si/H] = 0.3, which is [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi/nH)_sun =0.3. Therefore nSi/nH = 10^{0.3} * (nSi/nH)_sun.\n\nStar_2\'s [Si/H] = ?\n\nFrom Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. And [Mg/H]_2=0.\n\nThen [Mg/Si]= [Mg/H] - [Si/H]=0.3. Therefore, [Si/H]= [Mg/H] -0.3=0-0.3= -0.3.\n\nThus, Star_2 has [Si/H] =-0.3, so nSi/nH=10^{-0.3}(nSi/nH)_sun.\n\nTherefore, (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 )=10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}=10^{0.6}.\n\nBut if nH_1 =nH_2 (solar), then the answer is 10^{0.6}.\n\nSo the problem is ambiguous on H abundance? Or are we supposed to ignore the hydrogen scaling because all abundance ratios are given relative to H?\n\nWait, the problem states "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres". Since the densities of the photospheres may differ, but if the question is a number ratio (nSi) irrespective of the total density, then maybe it\'s (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (nSi/nH_1) / (nSi/nH_2) * (nH_1 /nH_2).\n\nBut without additional information on nH_1 /nH_2, unless another constraint relates nH\'s of the stars.\n\nWait, but [Fe/H]_1 =0 and [Mg/H]_2=0. But does that translate into a relation between their H abundances?\n\nWait, perhaps. Let me think.\n\nFor Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 => log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). Therefore, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nH_1 = nFe_1 / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) = nFe_1 *nH_sun / nFe_sun.\n\nBut if you don\'t know nFe_1, except that nFe_1 /nH_1 is solar. So you can\'t determine nFe_1 or nH_1 individually, only their ratio.\n\nSimilarly for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 =>nMg_2/nH_2 = nMgnH_sun\n\nSimilarly, without knowing absolute abundances, nH is indeterminate. But unless the problem wants a ratio in terms of solar abundances.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is (nSi_1 / nSi_2 )=(nSi/nH_1 * nH1 ) / (nSi/nH_2 * nH2 ). Unless nH1 /nH2 can be related through other means.\n\nBut unless Star_1\'s H abundance is altered. In the absence of any information, unless there is an assumption that H is consistent with solar. For stars with [Fe/H] =0 or [Mg/H] =0, astronomers usually take that to mean the star has solar metallicity, so all elements are solar unless otherwise stated, and H is the same as in the sun.\n\nBut since we are given that Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0 and Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, and need to find the ratio. If we have to consider the stars\' H abundances as solar, then (nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun). Then the ratio is 10^{0.6}.\n\nHowever, another approach: if Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, meaning their iron is solar-normalized. Therefore, if we compute [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1= 0.3+0=0.3. So [Si/H] for Star_1 is 0.3. For Star_2, [Si/H]_2= [Si/Mg]_2 + [Mg/H]_2. But wait, no: [Si/Mg] = [Si/H] - [Mg/H]. Therefore, from Star_2\'s [Mg/Si]=0.3, as [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] =0.3, which gives [Si/H]= [Mg/H] -0.3 =0 -0.3=-0.3.\n\nTherefore, [Si/H]1 =0.3 and [Si/H]2= -0.3.\n\nTherefore, the ratio (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 =10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}=10^{0.6}\n\nIf the H abundance in both stars is solar (same as the Sun\'s H abundance), then the ratio of number densities would indeed be 10^{0.6}. However, unless H is also varying. But if we consider the stars to have the same nH as the Sun (so not necessarily same total density, but same nH), then yes. \n\nHowever, given that the sun\'s nH is known, but the stars\' absolute hydrogen densities are not provided, but for the purpose of abundance ratios, in astronomy, when we say [X/H] =0, it\'s normalized to the same nH. Because if H were different, the ratios would be off. So in Star_1, if [Fe/H] is 0, and H varies, but all elements would have their abundances scaled relative to H. However, perhaps the key here is that in [X/Y] ratios, if Y is scaled in the same way as H, then the ratio [X/Y] would be independent. But in any case, given the problem doesn\'t indicate that the H abundances are different, we can safely assume they are the same as in the Sun. Therefore, H abundance is solar for both, so:\n\nnSi_1 / nSi_2 = 10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.\n\nSo the answer is 10^(0.6)≈ 3.98, so approximately 4. But need to present the exact answer. The problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres", so it\'s a numerical factor. 10^0.6 is exact, but maybe they want it written as 10^(0.6) or given as approx 4.0. But likely, the problem might want it in decimal form. Let me compute 10^0.6 precisely.\n\nWe can calculate 10^0.6 = e^{0.6 ln 10} ≈ e^{0.6*2.302585} ≈ e^{1.3815} ≈3.98. So, yes, about 3.98. So ≈4.0.\n\nBut the problem may want exact logarithmic expressions. Alternatively, exact expression is 10^{0.6}, or its numerical value. The question says "put your final answer within boxed{}", but usually, for ratios giving an exact value in the form 10^x is acceptable. Let\'s confirm my logic again.\n\nImportant steps:\n\nStar_1: [Fe/H]=0 implies nFe/nH = solar. Therefore [Si/Fe] =0.3 implies Si/Fe = solar *10^{0.3}. Therefore, Si/H= (Si/Fe) * (Fe/H) = solar_Si/Fe *10^{0.3} * solar_Fe/H = solar_Si/H *10^{0.3}.\n\nStar_2: [Mg/H]=0 implies Mg/H=solar. [Mg/Si]=0.3=log(Mg/Si)-log(solar_Mg/Si). Therefore, (Mg/Si)=solar_Mg/Si *10^{0.3}. Hence, Si/H = (Mg/H) / (Mg/Si) = solar_Mg/H / (solar_Mg/Si *10^{0.3}) )= (solar_Si/H ) /10^{0.3}.\n\nThus, Star_1: Si/H= solar_Si/H *10^{0.3}\n\nStar_2: Si/H= solar_Si/H*10^{-0.3}\n\nTherefore, ratio is 10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}=10^{0.6}. Hence, the ratio is 10^0.6 = approximately 3.98.\n\nGiven that no information suggests that H is different, and in standard abundance analysis, H is normalized to the solar value when giving [X/H]. Therefore, nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun. So (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (nSi/nH )1 / (nSi/nH )2=10^{0.6}.\n\nThus, Final answer: \\boxed{10^{0.6}} or \\boxed{3.98}. Probably boxed as 10^{0.6} because it\'s exact. But let me check if the question wants an exact number. Maybe via 0.3 - (-0.3) exponent?\n\nBut Star_1\'s [Si/H] is +0.3, Star_2\'s [Si/H] is -0.3, so the ratio is 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6}\n\nYes. So answer is 10^0.6. Around 4, but exact is 10^{0.6}\n\nSo the answer is boxed{10^{0.6}} or approximately boxed{4.0}. But likely the exact value is preferred.\n\nCheck once again with Si in Star_1:\n\nlog(nSi/nH)1= log(nSi/nH)sun +0.3\n\nStar_2:\n\nlog(nSi/nH)2= log(nSi/nH)sun -0.3\n\nAntilog difference is 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6}. So therefore, yes.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{10^{0.6}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743808974, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6124, prompt_tokens=1096, total_tokens=7220, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Given the elemental abundances of Star_1 and Star_2, we need to determine the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Abundance Relations for Star_1:**
   - \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\) implies the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is solar: \((nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_{\odot}\).
   - \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\) dex implies the silicon to iron ratio is enhanced: \((nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3}\).
   - Therefore, \((nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 \times (nFe/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3}\).

2. **Abundance Relations for Star_2:**
   - \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\) implies the magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is solar: \((nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_{\odot}\).
   - \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\) dex implies the magnesium to silicon ratio is enhanced: \((nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3}\).
   - Therefore, \((nSi/nH)_2 = \frac{(nMg/nH)_2}{(nMg/nSi)_2} = \frac{(nMg/nH)_{\odot}}{(nMg/nSi)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3}} = (nSi/nH)_{\odot} \times 10^{-0.3}\).

3. **Silicon Abundance Ratio:**
   - The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
     \[
     \frac{(nSi/nH)_1}{(nSi/nH)_2} = \frac{(nSi/nH)_{\odot} \times 10^{0.3}}{(nSi/nH)_{\odot} \times 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}
     \]

Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is \(\boxed{10^{0.6}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 don't have Si's abundance for the Sun. Hmm. That seems problematic because we need (nSi/nFe)_sun. Unless we can express the answer in terms of solar Si abundance that might cancel out? Wait, maybe not. The problem requires us to compute the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. Let me see.

Wait, maybe we can express nSi for each star in terms of solar abundances. For example, in Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Since (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3}.

But we know [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

Therefore, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1 = [(nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3}] * (nFe/nH)_sun.

Similarly, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, let me check that.

Wait, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1.

But (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3}.

And (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun * 10^[Fe/H]_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun, since [Fe/H]_1=0.

Therefore, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^{0.3} * (nFe/nH)_sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun * (nFe/nH)_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun. Because:

(nSi/nFe) * (nFe/nH) = (nSi/nH). So that's correct.

Therefore, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3}.

But we don't know (nSi/nH)_sun. Hmm. However, maybe in Star_2, which has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Which is log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0.3.

Therefore, (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^{0.3}.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 = 0, which is log(nMg/nH)_2 - log(nMg/nH)_sun = 0. So (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun.

Therefore, let's relate (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nH)_2 / (nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_2 = [(nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_2].

But from [Mg/Si]_2, we have:

(nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^{0.3}

Therefore, (nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun / [(nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^{0.3} ]

But (nMg/nSi)_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun.

Therefore,

(nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun / [ (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3} ) ] = (nSi/nH)_sun / 10^{0.3}

Therefore, (nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{-0.3}

So, comparing Star_1 and Star_2's silicon abundances:

Star_1: (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3}

Star_2: (nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{-0.3}

Therefore, the ratio (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 = [10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}] = 10^{0.6}.

But the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres, which is (nSi_1 / nSi_2). Assuming that the hydrogen abundances (nH) are the same for both stars? Wait, not necessarily. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun. But we don't have any information about [H] in the star. Because [Fe/H] is the ratio of Fe to H, but H could vary, but [Fe/H] is adjusted accordingly.

But, in reality, when we talk about [X/H], it's the metallicity relative to the Sun, meaning that all metals are scaled by the same factor. But H is the dominant element, so usually, when you scale a star's metallicity, you can think of it as scaling all metals by a factor while keeping H constant. But depending on the context, sometimes the metallicity is accounted for by the total metal content, but in this problem, we have [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, so their Fe abundance is same as solar, so (Fe/H) = solar, so the same ratio. But to get [Si/Fe] for Star_1, as the problem states, which would be the same as [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1. Wait, perhaps that's a way to proceed.

Wait, there is a relation between [Si/Fe] and [Si/H], [Fe/H]. Let me clarify the notation.

[A/B] = log(nA/nB) - log(nA/nB)_sun

But that can also be written as:

[A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]

Because:

[A/H] = log(nA/nH) - log(nA/nH)_sun

[B/H] = log(nB/nH) - log(nB/nH)_sun

Then [A/H] - [B/H] = [log(nA/nH) - log(nA/nH)_sun] - [log(nB/nH) - log(nB/nH)_sun]

Which is log(nA/nH) - log(nB/nH) - [log(nA/nH)_sun - log(nB/nH)_sun]

Which is log(nA/nB) - log(nA/nB)_sun = [A/B]

Yes. Therefore, [A/B] = [A/H] - [B/H]

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1

We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 = 0.3

Therefore, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3, meaning log(nSi/nH)_1 - log(nSi/nH)_sun = 0.3. Thus, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3}

For Star_2: we have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2

We know [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - 0.3 = -0.3

Thus, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3, which implies (nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{-0.3}

Therefore, the ratio of (nSi/nH)_1 to (nSi/nH)_2 is 10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98. 

But the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. If the stars have the same hydrogen abundance as the Sun, then the ratio would be 10^{0.6}. But do they? The problem doesn't specify. Since we are given abundances relative to H, but if H itself varies between the stars, then the actual nSi would be scaled by (nH / nH_sun). However, we are not given any information about the hydrogen abundances of the stars. The fact that [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 would indicate that in Star_1, nFe/nH = solar, and in Star_2, nMg/nH = solar. 

Assuming that the H abundance in Star_1 and Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. But if that's the case, then (nSi)_1/(nSi)_2 = [(nSi/nH)_1 * nH] / [(nSi/nH)_2 * nH] = (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.

Alternatively, if hydrogen is scaled as well, perhaps. However, generally, when [X/H] is given, it's relative to the solar ratio, so H is considered to be the same unless stated otherwise. So, unless there's a reason to suppose Star_1 and Star_2 have different H abundances, we assume they are same as solar. Moreover, since differential abundances are given, composition differences in H are unlikely unless they have different metallicities, but Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0 (so solar), and Star_2's [Mg/H] =0. But Star_2's metallicity for other elements is unknown. However, without any information about their overall metallicity scaling, we can only proceed under the standard assumption that [X/H] refers to the logarithmic abundance relative to the Sun, without implying any scaling of H.

Therefore, to compute the ratio of nSi_1 / nSi_2 is the same as (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 multiplied by (nH_1 / nH_2). If nH_1 = nH_2 = nH_sun, then it's 10^{0.6}. Therefore, the answer would be 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98. 

Alternatively, is there a way that hydrogen abundance could play a role here? Let's see. For Star_1, [Fe/H] =0: so Fe/H is solar. So if Solar Fe/H is 10^-4.5, their Fe abundance is the same Fe/H as the Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, so their Mg/H is solar.

But how does H's abundance differ? For example, if a star has [Fe/H] =0, then if H is depleted by some factor, but Fe is also depleted by the same factor.

But no, [Fe/H] is defined as log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_{sun}. So [Fe/H]=0 implies that the ratio nFe/nH is the same as in the Sun, but this does not say anything about the absolute value of nH. If both nFe and nH are scaled by the same factor, their ratio stays the same. However, without additional information, usually, stars abundances are normalized to H. So if we don't have information about H, we generally can’t know the absolute abundances. But in this problem, maybe we need to compare the number ratio nSi_1 to nSi_2 in the photosphere. 

Wait, maybe the problem is formulated in such a way that each star's heavy element abundances are relative to H, so the actual Si abundance in terms of H is:

For Star_1, (nSi/nH)_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi/nH)_sun

For Star_2, (nSi/nH)_2 = 10^{-0.3} * (nSi/nH)_sun

Therefore, their ratio is (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 = 10^{0.6}

But in order to get nSi_1 / nSi_2 = [ (nSi/nH)_1 * nH_1 ] / [ (nSi/nH)_2 * nH_2 ] = (10^{0.6} * nH_1 ) / nH_2

Therefore, unless nH_1 = nH_2, we can't know this ratio. But the problem gives [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0, which relates the metallicities. For Star_1, because [Fe/H]=0, Fe abundance is solar, so if H were different, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun), but since [Fe/H]=0, nFe/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun, so nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun). But the abundances for other elements like Si would then depend on their [X/Fe] ratios.

But perhaps here, the answer is as straightforward as 10^{0.6} because the H scaling would cancel out? Wait, but we don't know if H_1 and H_2 are the same. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps if Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, and Star_2 has [Mg/H] = 0, the total metallicity Z relative to H could differ, but as the problem gives only Fe and Mg for each star. So perhaps in Star_1, since [Fe/H] =0, the overall metallicity is similar to the Sun, so H abundance is similar. Similarly, in Star_2 with [Mg/H]=0, if Mg is a proxy for metallicity, then Star_2's metallicity would be solar, so H abundance similar as well. Therefore, both stars have solar H abundance, so nH_1 = nH_2 = nH_sun. Hence, (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = 10^{0.6} ≈ 4.

But thought process: without additional information about hydrogen abundances, we have to assume that their H is the same as the Sun. Otherwise, the problem is underdetermined. So consistent with LTE and EW methods, which determine abundances relative to H, so assume H is same as solar.

But since the question is from an exam or problem set, the answer is likely 10^0.6 = approx 3.98. Since 0.6 log10 is 3.98, approximately 4. But more precise, 10^0.6.

Wait, 10^0.6. Let me compute it. Log10(4)=0.602, so 10^0.6 is about 3.98.

Alternatively, 10^0.6. Let's do precise calculation:

0.6 in exponent: 10^0.6 ≈ e^{0.6*2.302585} ≈ e^{1.38155} ≈ 3.98. Yes.

Therefore, the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is 10^{0.6}, so exact value is 10^0.6, so the answer is 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) = 10^0.6. So the ratio is 10^0.6:1.

Alternatively, confirm:

Star_1's [Si/H] = 0.3, which is [Si/H] = log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi/nH)_sun =0.3. Therefore nSi/nH = 10^{0.3} * (nSi/nH)_sun.

Star_2's [Si/H] = ?

From Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. And [Mg/H]_2=0.

Then [Mg/Si]= [Mg/H] - [Si/H]=0.3. Therefore, [Si/H]= [Mg/H] -0.3=0-0.3= -0.3.

Thus, Star_2 has [Si/H] =-0.3, so nSi/nH=10^{-0.3}(nSi/nH)_sun.

Therefore, (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 )=10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}=10^{0.6}.

But if nH_1 =nH_2 (solar), then the answer is 10^{0.6}.

So the problem is ambiguous on H abundance? Or are we supposed to ignore the hydrogen scaling because all abundance ratios are given relative to H?

Wait, the problem states "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres". Since the densities of the photospheres may differ, but if the question is a number ratio (nSi) irrespective of the total density, then maybe it's (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (nSi/nH_1) / (nSi/nH_2) * (nH_1 /nH_2).

But without additional information on nH_1 /nH_2, unless another constraint relates nH's of the stars.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1 =0 and [Mg/H]_2=0. But does that translate into a relation between their H abundances?

Wait, perhaps. Let me think.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 => log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). Therefore, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nH_1 = nFe_1 / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) = nFe_1 *nH_sun / nFe_sun.

But if you don't know nFe_1, except that nFe_1 /nH_1 is solar. So you can't determine nFe_1 or nH_1 individually, only their ratio.

Similarly for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 =>nMg_2/nH_2 = nMgnH_sun

Similarly, without knowing absolute abundances, nH is indeterminate. But unless the problem wants a ratio in terms of solar abundances.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (nSi_1 / nSi_2 )=(nSi/nH_1 * nH1 ) / (nSi/nH_2 * nH2 ). Unless nH1 /nH2 can be related through other means.

But unless Star_1's H abundance is altered. In the absence of any information, unless there is an assumption that H is consistent with solar. For stars with [Fe/H] =0 or [Mg/H] =0, astronomers usually take that to mean the star has solar metallicity, so all elements are solar unless otherwise stated, and H is the same as in the sun.

But since we are given that Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0 and Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, and need to find the ratio. If we have to consider the stars' H abundances as solar, then (nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun). Then the ratio is 10^{0.6}.

However, another approach: if Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, meaning their iron is solar-normalized. Therefore, if we compute [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1= 0.3+0=0.3. So [Si/H] for Star_1 is 0.3. For Star_2, [Si/H]_2= [Si/Mg]_2 + [Mg/H]_2. But wait, no: [Si/Mg] = [Si/H] - [Mg/H]. Therefore, from Star_2's [Mg/Si]=0.3, as [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] =0.3, which gives [Si/H]= [Mg/H] -0.3 =0 -0.3=-0.3.

Therefore, [Si/H]1 =0.3 and [Si/H]2= -0.3.

Therefore, the ratio (nSi/nH)_1 / (nSi/nH)_2 =10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}=10^{0.6}

If the H abundance in both stars is solar (same as the Sun's H abundance), then the ratio of number densities would indeed be 10^{0.6}. However, unless H is also varying. But if we consider the stars to have the same nH as the Sun (so not necessarily same total density, but same nH), then yes. 

However, given that the sun's nH is known, but the stars' absolute hydrogen densities are not provided, but for the purpose of abundance ratios, in astronomy, when we say [X/H] =0, it's normalized to the same nH. Because if H were different, the ratios would be off. So in Star_1, if [Fe/H] is 0, and H varies, but all elements would have their abundances scaled relative to H. However, perhaps the key here is that in [X/Y] ratios, if Y is scaled in the same way as H, then the ratio [X/Y] would be independent. But in any case, given the problem doesn't indicate that the H abundances are different, we can safely assume they are the same as in the Sun. Therefore, H abundance is solar for both, so:

nSi_1 / nSi_2 = 10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3} = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the answer is 10^(0.6)≈ 3.98, so approximately 4. But need to present the exact answer. The problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres", so it's a numerical factor. 10^0.6 is exact, but maybe they want it written as 10^(0.6) or given as approx 4.0. But likely, the problem might want it in decimal form. Let me compute 10^0.6 precisely.

We can calculate 10^0.6 = e^{0.6 ln 10} ≈ e^{0.6*2.302585} ≈ e^{1.3815} ≈3.98. So, yes, about 3.98. So ≈4.0.

But the problem may want exact logarithmic expressions. Alternatively, exact expression is 10^{0.6}, or its numerical value. The question says "put your final answer within boxed{}", but usually, for ratios giving an exact value in the form 10^x is acceptable. Let's confirm my logic again.

Important steps:

Star_1: [Fe/H]=0 implies nFe/nH = solar. Therefore [Si/Fe] =0.3 implies Si/Fe = solar *10^{0.3}. Therefore, Si/H= (Si/Fe) * (Fe/H) = solar_Si/Fe *10^{0.3} * solar_Fe/H = solar_Si/H *10^{0.3}.

Star_2: [Mg/H]=0 implies Mg/H=solar. [Mg/Si]=0.3=log(Mg/Si)-log(solar_Mg/Si). Therefore, (Mg/Si)=solar_Mg/Si *10^{0.3}. Hence, Si/H = (Mg/H) / (Mg/Si) = solar_Mg/H / (solar_Mg/Si *10^{0.3}) )= (solar_Si/H ) /10^{0.3}.

Thus, Star_1: Si/H= solar_Si/H *10^{0.3}

Star_2: Si/H= solar_Si/H*10^{-0.3}

Therefore, ratio is 10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}=10^{0.6}. Hence, the ratio is 10^0.6 = approximately 3.98.

Given that no information suggests that H is different, and in standard abundance analysis, H is normalized to the solar value when giving [X/H]. Therefore, nH_1 =nH_2 =nH_sun. So (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (nSi/nH )1 / (nSi/nH )2=10^{0.6}.

Thus, Final answer: \boxed{10^{0.6}} or \boxed{3.98}. Probably boxed as 10^{0.6} because it's exact. But let me check if the question wants an exact number. Maybe via 0.3 - (-0.3) exponent?

But Star_1's [Si/H] is +0.3, Star_2's [Si/H] is -0.3, so the ratio is 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6}

Yes. So answer is 10^0.6. Around 4, but exact is 10^{0.6}

So the answer is boxed{10^{0.6}} or approximately boxed{4.0}. But likely the exact value is preferred.

Check once again with Si in Star_1:

log(nSi/nH)1= log(nSi/nH)sun +0.3

Star_2:

log(nSi/nH)2= log(nSi/nH)sun -0.3

Antilog difference is 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6}. So therefore, yes.


**Final Answer**
\boxed{10^{0.6}}

Let\'s attempt that.\n\nWe know that [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, which leads to (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.\n\nBut (nFe)_1 = (nFe)sun (from [Fe/H]_1 = 0), so (nSi)_1 = (nFe)_1 * (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nFe)sun * 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.\n\nWait, but (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi/sun) / (nFe/sun) = [(nSi/nH)sun] / [(nFe/nH)sun]. Since the sun\'s nFe/nH is 10^-4.5 (from 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5, which is 7.5 - 12 = -4.5). Therefore, log(nFe/nH)sun = -4.5. Similarly, if the problem states the sun\'s 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7, which becomes log(nMg/nH)sun = -5.\n\nBut we need log(nSi/nH)sun. Wait, but again, that\'s not provided. This seems like a problem. The problem gives the Sun\'s iron and magnesium abundances but not silicon. If nSi/nH is not given, perhaps there\'s another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in solving for (nSi_1)/(nSi_2), the solar values for Si will cancel out.\n\nWait, perhaps for both stars, the problem allows expression of [Si/H] through given ratios? Let\'s see.\n\nStar_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So (nFe_1/nH) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun). Then (nSi_1/nH) = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1/nH) = (10^0.3*(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).\n\nBut nSi_sun/nH_sun would require solar Si abundance. But we don\'t have that in the problem. Wait, maybe through another star? Let\'s look at Star_2\'s details.\n\nFor Star_2:\n- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex,\n- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.\n\nSo, (nMg/nSi)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_sun = 10^0.3, and (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun * 10^[Mg/H]_2. Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, that implies (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun.\n\nSo for Star_2: (nMg/nH}_2 = (nMg/nH}_sun = 10^{-5} ), as given by the solar magnesium abundance (12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 implies log(nMg/nH) = -5).\n\nBut also, (nMg/nSi}_2 = (nMg/nH}_2 / (nSi/nH}_2) = [ (nMg/H}_2 ) / (nSi/H}_2) ].\n\nBut (nMg/nH}_2 )= 10^{-5}, so (nSi/nH}_2) = (nMg/nH}_2 ) / (nMg/nSi)_2.\n\nBut (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi}_sun ) * 10^{0.3} (since [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3), so:\n\n(nSi/nH}_2 )= [ (nMg/nH}_2 ) / ( (nMg/nSi}_sun * 10^{0.3} ) ) ].\n\nBut I need (nMg/nSi)_sun. (nMg/nSi)_sun is (nMg/sun /nH) / (nSi/sun /nH) = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun.\n\nGiven (nMg/nH)_sun = 10^{-5}, but again, (nSi/nH)_sun is missing.\n\nWait, unless we can relate (nSi/nH}_sun from Star_1.\n\nBut in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so Fe/H = solar. [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, so:\n\n(nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^{0.3}*(nSi/nFe}_sun => (nSi}_1 / nFe_1) = 10^{0.3}*(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).\n\nBut (nFe_1) = nFe_sun (since [Fe/H]_1 = 0). Therefore, nSi_1 = nFe_sun * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) = nSi_sun * 10^{0.3}.\n\nTherefore, the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 would be (nSi_sun * 10^{0.3}) / nSi_2.\n\nBut we need nSi_2. How can we find nSi_2?\n\nFor Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. Let\'s write that.\n\nFirst, from Star_2:\n- [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (nMg/nSi}_2 ) - log( (nMg/nSi}_sun ) ) =0.3 => log( (nMg/nSi}_2 / (nMg/nSi}_sun ) )) =0.3 => (nMg/nSi}_2 = (nMg/nSi}_sun ) * 10^{0.3}  =>\n\n(nMg/nSi}_2 = [(nMg/sun /nH)_sun ) / (nSi/sun /nH}_sun )] * 10^{0.3} )\n\n=> (nMg/nSi}_2 = ( (nMg/nH}_sun ) / (nSi/nH}_sun ) ) * 10^{0.3} )\n\nTherefore, (nMg/nH}_2 is equal to (nMg/nH}_sun ), since [Mg/H}_2 = 0.\n\nBut note that nMg/nH}_2 = (nMg/sun)/nH} )_2 = (nMg/sun}/nH}_sun ) as given. So:\n\nFrom Star_2, nMg/nH}_2 = (nMg/sun}/nH}_sun ) .\n\nBut nMg/nH}_2 can also be written as (nMg/nSi_2) * (nSi/nH}_2 ). So:\n\n(nMg/nSi}_2 )*(nSi/nH}_2 ) = (nMg/nH}_sun )\n\nSo, we plug in (nMg/nSi}_sun ) / 10^{-0.3} ) * (nSi/nH}_2 ) = (nMg/nH}_sun ).\n\nBut wait, according to earlier result, (nMg/nSi}_2 ) = (nMg/nSi}_sun ) * 10^{0.3}\n\nWait, yes:\n\n(nMg/nSi}_2 ) = (nMg/nSi}_sun ) *10^{0.3}.\n\nSo then:\n\n(nMg/nSi}_sun ) *10^{0.3} * (nSi/nH}_2 ) ) = (nMg/nH}_sun )\n\nThus,\n(nSi/nH}_2 ) = (nMg/nH}_sun ) / [ (nMg/nSi}_sun ) * 10^{0.3} ] \n= [ (nMg/nH}_sun ) / (nMg/nSi}_sun ) ) ] * 10^{-0.3} \n\nBut (nMg/nH}_sun ) divided by (nMg/nSi}_sun) is (nMg/H}_sun / (nMg/nSi}_sun )) = (nSi}_sun / H}_sun ) )\n\nThus, (nSi/nH}_sun ). Therefore:\n\n(nSi/nH}_2 ) = (nSi/nH}_sun ) * 10^{-0.3}\n\nThus, (nSi/nH}_2 ) = (nSi/nH}_sun ) * 10^{-0.3}\n\nBut from Star_1, we determined that (nSi/nH}_1 ) = (nSi/sun/nH}_sun ) * 10^{0.3}\n\nBecause Star_1\'s nSi = nSi_sun *10^{0.3}, since (nSi}_1 / nFe_1 ) = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ), with nFe_1 = nFe_sun, so (nSi_1/nH}_1 )= (nSi_1 /nFe_1 ) * (nFe_1/nH}_1 ) = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * (nFe_sun /nH}_sun ). Thus: (nSi}_1/nH}_sun ) ) *10^{0.3}\n\nWait, no, since nFe_1/nH}_1 is solar. So nFe_1/nH}_1 =nFe_sun /nH}_sun =10^{-4.5}\n\nBut by problem statement, Star_1\'s [Fe/H] is 0, which implies that nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun=10^{-4.5}\n\nThen [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log[(nSi/nFe)_1] - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3\n\nSo (nSi/nFe}_1 )= (nSi/nFe}_sun ) *10^{0.3}\n\nTherefore, nSi_1 =nFe_1 / (nFe}_sun ) * (nSi}_sun)*10^{0.3}\n\nBut since nFe_1/nH}_1 =nFe_sun/nH}_sun, so nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH}_1 /nH}_sun )\n\nBut, hold on. If the problem doesn\'t mention anything about H abundance, so H in the stars. Generally, we assume that Hydrogen abundance (relative to H, well, but actually, when we do [Fe/H], unless there\'s information about H variation, we take H abundance as the same as the sun, meaning that [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH}_sun ) )\n\nSo assuming that H abundance doesn\'t differ from the Sun. Therefore, nH in Star_1 and Star_2 is same as the solar.\n\nWait, but perhaps this is an assumption in LTE and with the EW method, which uses ratios with H lines? Without knowing more, we might proceed under that assumption, that nH (the number density of Hydrogen) is same as the sun. So, for both stars, since [Fe/H}_1 =0, that\'s log(nFe/nH} star1 ) = log(nFe/nH}_sun ), so (nFe/nH} star1 ) = (nFe/nH}_sun ). Similarly for [Mg/H}_2=0, so (nMg/nH} star2 )=(nMg/nH}_sun )\n\nThen, for Star_1, since [Fe/H] = 0, nFe = nFe_sun * (nH /nH}_sun ) ) but assuming nH= nH}_sun, so nFe_1 =nFe_sun. So yes, for [Si/Fe] Abundance in Star1 is 0.3. Then:\n\n(nSi}_1 /nFe}_1 )=10^{0.3}*(nSi}_sun /nFe}_sun )\n\n=> nSi}_1 =10^{0.3}*(nSi}_sun /nFe}_sun )*nFe}_1=10^{0.3}*nSi}_sun * (nFe}_1 /nFe}_sun )\n\nBut since nFe}_1 =nFe_sun, that reduces to nSi}_1=10^{0.3}*nSi}_sun.\n\nHence, (nSi/nH}_1 )=10^{0.3}*nSi_sun /nH_sun, but only if we normalize nH to solar, which is a safe assumption here.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem probably wants the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2.\n\nSo from Star_1, nSi_1 =10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.\n\nFrom Star_2, as determined earlier, (nSi/nH)_2}=(nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^{-0.3}, hence nSi}_2 =10^{-0.3}*nSi}_sun.\n\nWait, how did we get that?\n\nEarlier reasoning for Star_2:\n\nWe found that (nSi/nH}_2 ) =(nSi_sun/nH}_sun ) *10^{-0.3}\n\nTherefore, yes, nSi}_2/nH}_2= (nSi_sun/nH}_sun)* 10^{-0.3}\n\nSince we assume nH}_2 =nH}_sun (since [Fe/H} or other elements don\'t indicate H variation), then nSi}_2 =nSi_sun*10^{-0.3}\n\nThus, the ratio, nSi_1/ nSi_2 = (10^{0.3}*nSi_sun) / (10^{-0.3}*nSi_sun )) =10^{0.6}\n\nTherefore, log10(nSi_1/nSi_2} )=0.6, which is 10^{0.6} = antilog of 0.6 ≈ 3.98 ≈ 4, but likely exact value =10^0.6= (10^0.3)^2=(2)^2=4, but no, 10^(0.3)=2 approximately (exactly 10^0.3010=2). But 0.3 is approximate, but perhaps the question wants an exact exponent. Wait, maybe not, just write 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98 or can be expressed as 10^(0.3 +0.3) = (10^0.3)^2≈ (2)^2=4, but perhaps they just expect the exact exponent.\n\nWait, summarizing:\n\nStar_1: nSi = nSi_sun ×10^0.3\n\nStar_2: nSi =nSi_sun ×10^−0.3\n\nThus, ratio =10^0.3 /10^-0.3 =10^{0.6}, so 10^{3/5} = about 3.98.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants the answer as 10^0.6, but usually, it\'s given in decimal.\n\nAlternatively, Si abundance for the stars is relative to their hydrogen, but photosphere ratio is purely Si atoms. So the ratio would be (nSi_1 /nH) / (nSi_2 /nH). Which is (nSi_1 /nSi_2). Since in both, nH is taken as solar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10^{0.6}\n\nBut let me double-check calculations.\n\nWait, Star_1 has:\n\n[Fe/H}=0 ⇒ fFe_1 = fFe_sun, where fA = nA/nH.\n\n[Si/Fe}=0.3 ⇒ log(fSi_1/fFe_1) - log(fSi_sun/fFe_sun)=0.3 ⇒ fSi_1 = fSi_sun /fFe_sun *10^{0.3} * fFe_1. But since fFe_1 =fFe_sun, cancels with denominator:\n\nfSi_1 =10^{0.3} *fSi_sun ⇒fSi_1= 10^{0.3} times solar fSi.\n\nStar_2 has:\n\n[Mg/H}=0 ⇒ fMg_2 =fMg_sun.\n\n[Mg/Si}=0.3⇒ log(fMg_2/fSi_2) - log(fMg_sun/fSi_sun)=0.3 ⇒ log[(fMg_2/fSi_2)/(fMg_sun/fSi_sun)]=0.3 ⇒ (fMg_2/fSi_2)=10^{0.3}*(fMg_sun/fSi_sun). But since fMg_2 =fMg_sun,\n\nTherefore: fMg_sun /fSi_2=10^{0.3}*fMg_sun/fSi_sun.\n\nMultiply both sides by fSi_2/fMg_sun:\n\n1=10^{0.3}*(fMg_sun/fSi_sun)*(fSi_2/fMg_sun)=10^{0.3}*(fSi_2/f Si_sun )\n\nThus,\n\n1 =10^{0.3}*(fSi_2/fSi_sun) ⇒ fSi_2= fSi_sun/10^{0.3} = fSi_sun*10^{-0.3}\n\nHence, fSi_1 /fSi_2 = (10^{0.3} fSi_sun ) / (10^{-0.3} fSi_sun )=10^{0.6}\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 10^{0.6}:1. Which is approximately 3.98, but exact decimal as 10^0.6≈10^(6/10)=10^(3/5). The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. The answer is 10^{0.6}, but since it\'s a ratio, perhaps they want it in dex notation, but ratio now is just a number. Alternatively, 10^{0.6} = (10^{0.3})^2. Given approximately:\n\nLog(4)=0.60, so 10^0.6≈4. So the answer could be approximately 4. But if keeping log , then 10^{0.6}, but maybe for accuracy\'s sake, the answer is 3.98 times, but since it\'s an exact exponent, perhaps writing 10^{0.6} as \\boxed{10^{0.6}} or 3.98 in decimal.\n\nBut let me verify once more. Alternatively, maybe there\'s an error here. Let me check:\n\nOriginal derivation:\n\nStar 1:\n [Si/Fe}]=0.3\n [Fe/H]=0 ⇒[Fe/H}=log(fFe) - log(fFe_sun)=0 ⇒ fFe = fFe_sun\n [Si/Fe}=log(fSi/fFe) - log(fSi_sun/fFe_sun)=0.3=>log((fSi/fFe)/(fSi_sun/fFe_sun))=0.3\n\n Since fFe = fFe_sun, the ratio becomes (fSi)/(fSi_sun) = 10^0.3 ⇒ fSi1 = 10^0.3× fSi_sun.\n\nStar 2：\n[Mg/Si}]=0.3， [Mg/H}=0.\n\n[Mg/H}=0 ⇒ fMg= fMg_sun.\n\n[Mg/Si}=log(fMg/fSi) - log(fMg_sun/fSi_sun)}=0.3 ⇒ log( (fMg /fSi)/(fMg_sun/fSi_sun) ) =0.3 => (fMg/fSi)=10^{0.3}× fMg_sun/fSi_sun.\n\nBut since fMg = fMg_sun,\n\n=> fMg_sun/fSi_2=10^{0.3} fMg_sun/fSi_sun ⇒\n\n =>1/fSi_2=10^{0.3}/ fSi_sun ⇒ fSi_2= fSi_sun /10^{0.3} = fSi_sun ×10^{-0.3}\n\nThus, measuring both％\n\nfSi1 / fSi2= (10^{0.3}fSi_sun) / (10^{-0.3}fSi_sun )= 10^{0.6} ≈3.98\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 4, but since the question is from astronomy, inverse exams would prefer the exact expression in terms of exponent or log, so 10^{0.6}. But let me check how the elemental abundance is defined. Alternative path.\n\nSecond approach:\n\nFor [Si/Fe] in Star 1: 0.3 dex.\n\nStar 1 also has [Fe/H}=0.\n\nStar 1\'s Silicon abundance is [Si/H} = [Si/Fe} + [Fe/H} ]=0.3 +0=0.3 (dex). So in terms of nSi/nH, Sistar1= nSi_sun/nH_sun ×10^{0.3}\n\nStar 2 has [Mg/H} =0 and [Mg/Si}]=0.3.\n\nFirst, compute [Si/H}, then connect to Star 2\'s [Si/H}.\n\n[Mg/Si}=0.3= [Mg/H} −[Si/H}].\n\nWait, yes, since[A/B} = [A/H} -[B/H}.\n\nThus, [Mg/Si}= [Mg/H} −[Si/H}.\n\nGiven that [Mg/Si}=0.3 and [Mg/H}=0,\n\nThus, 0.3=0 − [Si/H}, which implies [Si/H}=−0.3.\n\nTherefore, Star2\'s [Si/H}=-0.3, meaning nSi/nH=10^{-0.3} ×nSi_sun/nH_sun\n\nCompare with Star1\'s [Si/H}=0.3: nSi/nH1=10^{0.3} ×nSi_sun/nH_sun\n\nAssuming Sun’s nSi_sun/nH_sun.\nHowever, since both have nH as solar, given their [Fe/H} and [Mg/H} are just deviations but not in H. So for both stars, nH is as solar. Hence, the ratio (nSi1 *nH_sun/(nH1)) / (nSi2 *nH_sun/(nH2)) )= (nSi1/nSi2} ) as (nH1=nH2 =nH_sun)\n\nBut nH1 and nH2 are the same, yes. Therefore:\n\nnSi1/nSi2= (nSi1/nH)/(nSi2/nH)= (fSi1)/fSi2 )=10^{0.6} which matches the previous calculation.\n\nSo either way, that holds.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 10^{0.6}.\n\nSo confirming that.\n\nSince 10^{0.6}=antilog(0.6)=approx 3.98, but the problem doesn\'t specify to numerical value, so should we present it in exponent or decimal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe more accurately:\n\nlog_{10}(nSi_1/nSi_2)=0.6\n\nBut the problem just asks for the ratio of Si atoms, so this would be 10^{0.6}\n\nBut the question comes from astrophysics and wants an exact answer. Let me check if 10^{0.6} is acceptable, yes, in these sciences we leave sometimes in dex form, but here they\'re asking for the ratio of atoms. 10^{0.6} is natural, and as approximately 4, but it\'s possible that the answer is expected to write 10^{0.6}.\n\nAlternatively, as:\n\n0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6 dex difference.\n\nBut I think the answer is 10^{0.6}, which we can write as 10^{3/5}, but we can leave it as 10^{0.6}.\n\nHence, boxed: \\boxed{10^{0.6}} OR \\boxed{10^{3/5}}, but exponent decimal is more common.\n\nAlternatively, if the student wants to evaluate numerically, 10^0.6 ≈3.98≈4. or the exact expression. The problem states "calculate the ratio of silicon atoms", so precisely it would be 10^{0.6} if they permit the symbolic answer. However, being astronomy context sometimes decimals might be more acceptable, though likely adhere to exact exponent. Alternatively, when teaching classes, sometimes accept both, but need to see exact answer preferred.\n\nWait the problem says "calculate the ratio", but given that the answer is a round exponent 0.6, perhaps they accept the exact exponential factor.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we start by analyzing the given abundance data and the solar photospheric composition.

**Given Data:**
- **Star_1**: [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]₁ = 0 dex
- **Star_2**: [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 dex, [Mg/H]₂ = 0 dex
- **Solar Values**: \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5\) and \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7\)

**Step 1: Abundances for Star_1**
- Since [Fe/H]₁ = 0, the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is solar: \(n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Fe,Sun}}/n_{\text{H}}\).
- [Si/Fe]₁ = 0.3 implies \(\log_{10}((n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}})/(n_{\text{Si,Sun}}/n_{\text{Fe,Sun}})) = 0.3\). 
 "Translating this to ratios: \(n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,Sun}}/n_{\text{Fe,Sun}}\). Since \(n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,Sun}}\), we find \(n_{\text{Si,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,Sun}}\).

**Step 2: Abundances for Star_2**
- [Mg/H]₂ = 0, so \(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H}} = n_{\text{Mg,Sun}}/n_{\text{H}}\).
- [Mg/Si]₂ = 0.3 implies \(\log_{10}((n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}})/(n_{\text{Mg,Sun}}/n_{\text{Si,Sun}})) = 0.3\). 
 "Converting to ratios: \(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Mg,Sun}}/n_{\text{Si,Sun}}\). Given \(n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,Sun}}\), we solve for \(n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,Sun}}\).

**Step 3: Silicon Ratio**
- The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,Sun}}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot n_{\text{Si,Sun}}} = 10^{0.3 + 0.3} = 10^{0.6}.
  \]

**Final Answer:**
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is \(\boxed{10^{0.6}}\).

 Wait, this might be a problem. How can I find nSi (silicon) abundance for the Sun?

But perhaps in the standard solar abundances, which we would need to use. However, since the problem hasn't provided the Sun's [Si/H], we might need to proceed differently. Wait, maybe the information provided is sufficient once I consider the relations through the stars' abundances.

Alternatively, let me note that for Star_1, we know [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, so [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe)star1 - log(nSi/nFe)sun = 0.3. But since we don't know log(nSi/nFe)sun, but perhaps we can express (nSi)_1 in terms of (nFe)_1 and solar ratios. Let's attempt that.

We know that [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, which leads to (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But (nFe)_1 = (nFe)sun (from [Fe/H]_1 = 0), so (nSi)_1 = (nFe)_1 * (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nFe)sun * 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, but (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi/sun) / (nFe/sun) = [(nSi/nH)sun] / [(nFe/nH)sun]. Since the sun's nFe/nH is 10^-4.5 (from 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5, which is 7.5 - 12 = -4.5). Therefore, log(nFe/nH)sun = -4.5. Similarly, if the problem states the sun's 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7, which becomes log(nMg/nH)sun = -5.

But we need log(nSi/nH)sun. Wait, but again, that's not provided. This seems like a problem. The problem gives the Sun's iron and magnesium abundances but not silicon. If nSi/nH is not given, perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe in solving for (nSi_1)/(nSi_2), the solar values for Si will cancel out.

Wait, perhaps for both stars, the problem allows expression of [Si/H] through given ratios? Let's see.

Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So (nFe_1/nH) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun). Then (nSi_1/nH) = (nSi_1/nFe_1) * (nFe_1/nH) = (10^0.3*(nSi_sun/nFe_sun)) * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

But nSi_sun/nH_sun would require solar Si abundance. But we don't have that in the problem. Wait, maybe through another star? Let's look at Star_2's details.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex,
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

So, (nMg/nSi)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_sun = 10^0.3, and (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun * 10^[Mg/H]_2. Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, that implies (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun.

So for Star_2: (nMg/nH}_2 = (nMg/nH}_sun = 10^{-5} ), as given by the solar magnesium abundance (12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 implies log(nMg/nH) = -5).

But also, (nMg/nSi}_2 = (nMg/nH}_2 / (nSi/nH}_2) = [ (nMg/H}_2 ) / (nSi/H}_2) ].

But (nMg/nH}_2 )= 10^{-5}, so (nSi/nH}_2) = (nMg/nH}_2 ) / (nMg/nSi)_2.

But (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi}_sun ) * 10^{0.3} (since [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3), so:

(nSi/nH}_2 )= [ (nMg/nH}_2 ) / ( (nMg/nSi}_sun * 10^{0.3} ) ) ].

But I need (nMg/nSi)_sun. (nMg/nSi)_sun is (nMg/sun /nH) / (nSi/sun /nH) = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun.

Given (nMg/nH)_sun = 10^{-5}, but again, (nSi/nH)_sun is missing.

Wait, unless we can relate (nSi/nH}_sun from Star_1.

But in Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so Fe/H = solar. [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, so:

(nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^{0.3}*(nSi/nFe}_sun => (nSi}_1 / nFe_1) = 10^{0.3}*(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But (nFe_1) = nFe_sun (since [Fe/H]_1 = 0). Therefore, nSi_1 = nFe_sun * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) = nSi_sun * 10^{0.3}.

Therefore, the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 would be (nSi_sun * 10^{0.3}) / nSi_2.

But we need nSi_2. How can we find nSi_2?

For Star_2, we have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. Let's write that.

First, from Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (nMg/nSi}_2 ) - log( (nMg/nSi}_sun ) ) =0.3 => log( (nMg/nSi}_2 / (nMg/nSi}_sun ) )) =0.3 => (nMg/nSi}_2 = (nMg/nSi}_sun ) * 10^{0.3}  =>

(nMg/nSi}_2 = [(nMg/sun /nH)_sun ) / (nSi/sun /nH}_sun )] * 10^{0.3} )

=> (nMg/nSi}_2 = ( (nMg/nH}_sun ) / (nSi/nH}_sun ) ) * 10^{0.3} )

Therefore, (nMg/nH}_2 is equal to (nMg/nH}_sun ), since [Mg/H}_2 = 0.

But note that nMg/nH}_2 = (nMg/sun)/nH} )_2 = (nMg/sun}/nH}_sun ) as given. So:

From Star_2, nMg/nH}_2 = (nMg/sun}/nH}_sun ) .

But nMg/nH}_2 can also be written as (nMg/nSi_2) * (nSi/nH}_2 ). So:

(nMg/nSi}_2 )*(nSi/nH}_2 ) = (nMg/nH}_sun )

So, we plug in (nMg/nSi}_sun ) / 10^{-0.3} ) * (nSi/nH}_2 ) = (nMg/nH}_sun ).

But wait, according to earlier result, (nMg/nSi}_2 ) = (nMg/nSi}_sun ) * 10^{0.3}

Wait, yes:

(nMg/nSi}_2 ) = (nMg/nSi}_sun ) *10^{0.3}.

So then:

(nMg/nSi}_sun ) *10^{0.3} * (nSi/nH}_2 ) ) = (nMg/nH}_sun )

Thus,
(nSi/nH}_2 ) = (nMg/nH}_sun ) / [ (nMg/nSi}_sun ) * 10^{0.3} ] 
= [ (nMg/nH}_sun ) / (nMg/nSi}_sun ) ) ] * 10^{-0.3} 

But (nMg/nH}_sun ) divided by (nMg/nSi}_sun) is (nMg/H}_sun / (nMg/nSi}_sun )) = (nSi}_sun / H}_sun ) )

Thus, (nSi/nH}_sun ). Therefore:

(nSi/nH}_2 ) = (nSi/nH}_sun ) * 10^{-0.3}

Thus, (nSi/nH}_2 ) = (nSi/nH}_sun ) * 10^{-0.3}

But from Star_1, we determined that (nSi/nH}_1 ) = (nSi/sun/nH}_sun ) * 10^{0.3}

Because Star_1's nSi = nSi_sun *10^{0.3}, since (nSi}_1 / nFe_1 ) = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ), with nFe_1 = nFe_sun, so (nSi_1/nH}_1 )= (nSi_1 /nFe_1 ) * (nFe_1/nH}_1 ) = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * (nFe_sun /nH}_sun ). Thus: (nSi}_1/nH}_sun ) ) *10^{0.3}

Wait, no, since nFe_1/nH}_1 is solar. So nFe_1/nH}_1 =nFe_sun /nH}_sun =10^{-4.5}

But by problem statement, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, which implies that nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun=10^{-4.5}

Then [Si/Fe] is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log[(nSi/nFe)_1] - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3

So (nSi/nFe}_1 )= (nSi/nFe}_sun ) *10^{0.3}

Therefore, nSi_1 =nFe_1 / (nFe}_sun ) * (nSi}_sun)*10^{0.3}

But since nFe_1/nH}_1 =nFe_sun/nH}_sun, so nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH}_1 /nH}_sun )

But, hold on. If the problem doesn't mention anything about H abundance, so H in the stars. Generally, we assume that Hydrogen abundance (relative to H, well, but actually, when we do [Fe/H], unless there's information about H variation, we take H abundance as the same as the sun, meaning that [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH}_sun ) )

So assuming that H abundance doesn't differ from the Sun. Therefore, nH in Star_1 and Star_2 is same as the solar.

Wait, but perhaps this is an assumption in LTE and with the EW method, which uses ratios with H lines? Without knowing more, we might proceed under that assumption, that nH (the number density of Hydrogen) is same as the sun. So, for both stars, since [Fe/H}_1 =0, that's log(nFe/nH} star1 ) = log(nFe/nH}_sun ), so (nFe/nH} star1 ) = (nFe/nH}_sun ). Similarly for [Mg/H}_2=0, so (nMg/nH} star2 )=(nMg/nH}_sun )

Then, for Star_1, since [Fe/H] = 0, nFe = nFe_sun * (nH /nH}_sun ) ) but assuming nH= nH}_sun, so nFe_1 =nFe_sun. So yes, for [Si/Fe] Abundance in Star1 is 0.3. Then:

(nSi}_1 /nFe}_1 )=10^{0.3}*(nSi}_sun /nFe}_sun )

=> nSi}_1 =10^{0.3}*(nSi}_sun /nFe}_sun )*nFe}_1=10^{0.3}*nSi}_sun * (nFe}_1 /nFe}_sun )

But since nFe}_1 =nFe_sun, that reduces to nSi}_1=10^{0.3}*nSi}_sun.

Hence, (nSi/nH}_1 )=10^{0.3}*nSi_sun /nH_sun, but only if we normalize nH to solar, which is a safe assumption here.

Alternatively, since the problem probably wants the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2.

So from Star_1, nSi_1 =10^{0.3} *nSi_sun.

From Star_2, as determined earlier, (nSi/nH)_2}=(nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^{-0.3}, hence nSi}_2 =10^{-0.3}*nSi}_sun.

Wait, how did we get that?

Earlier reasoning for Star_2:

We found that (nSi/nH}_2 ) =(nSi_sun/nH}_sun ) *10^{-0.3}

Therefore, yes, nSi}_2/nH}_2= (nSi_sun/nH}_sun)* 10^{-0.3}

Since we assume nH}_2 =nH}_sun (since [Fe/H} or other elements don't indicate H variation), then nSi}_2 =nSi_sun*10^{-0.3}

Thus, the ratio, nSi_1/ nSi_2 = (10^{0.3}*nSi_sun) / (10^{-0.3}*nSi_sun )) =10^{0.6}

Therefore, log10(nSi_1/nSi_2} )=0.6, which is 10^{0.6} = antilog of 0.6 ≈ 3.98 ≈ 4, but likely exact value =10^0.6= (10^0.3)^2=(2)^2=4, but no, 10^(0.3)=2 approximately (exactly 10^0.3010=2). But 0.3 is approximate, but perhaps the question wants an exact exponent. Wait, maybe not, just write 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98 or can be expressed as 10^(0.3 +0.3) = (10^0.3)^2≈ (2)^2=4, but perhaps they just expect the exact exponent.

Wait, summarizing:

Star_1: nSi = nSi_sun ×10^0.3

Star_2: nSi =nSi_sun ×10^−0.3

Thus, ratio =10^0.3 /10^-0.3 =10^{0.6}, so 10^{3/5} = about 3.98.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the answer as 10^0.6, but usually, it's given in decimal.

Alternatively, Si abundance for the stars is relative to their hydrogen, but photosphere ratio is purely Si atoms. So the ratio would be (nSi_1 /nH) / (nSi_2 /nH). Which is (nSi_1 /nSi_2). Since in both, nH is taken as solar.

Therefore, the answer is 10^{0.6}

But let me double-check calculations.

Wait, Star_1 has:

[Fe/H}=0 ⇒ fFe_1 = fFe_sun, where fA = nA/nH.

[Si/Fe}=0.3 ⇒ log(fSi_1/fFe_1) - log(fSi_sun/fFe_sun)=0.3 ⇒ fSi_1 = fSi_sun /fFe_sun *10^{0.3} * fFe_1. But since fFe_1 =fFe_sun, cancels with denominator:

fSi_1 =10^{0.3} *fSi_sun ⇒fSi_1= 10^{0.3} times solar fSi.

Star_2 has:

[Mg/H}=0 ⇒ fMg_2 =fMg_sun.

[Mg/Si}=0.3⇒ log(fMg_2/fSi_2) - log(fMg_sun/fSi_sun)=0.3 ⇒ log[(fMg_2/fSi_2)/(fMg_sun/fSi_sun)]=0.3 ⇒ (fMg_2/fSi_2)=10^{0.3}*(fMg_sun/fSi_sun). But since fMg_2 =fMg_sun,

Therefore: fMg_sun /fSi_2=10^{0.3}*fMg_sun/fSi_sun.

Multiply both sides by fSi_2/fMg_sun:

1=10^{0.3}*(fMg_sun/fSi_sun)*(fSi_2/fMg_sun)=10^{0.3}*(fSi_2/f Si_sun )

Thus,

1 =10^{0.3}*(fSi_2/fSi_sun) ⇒ fSi_2= fSi_sun/10^{0.3} = fSi_sun*10^{-0.3}

Hence, fSi_1 /fSi_2 = (10^{0.3} fSi_sun ) / (10^{-0.3} fSi_sun )=10^{0.6}

Therefore, the ratio is 10^{0.6}:1. Which is approximately 3.98, but exact decimal as 10^0.6≈10^(6/10)=10^(3/5). The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres. The answer is 10^{0.6}, but since it's a ratio, perhaps they want it in dex notation, but ratio now is just a number. Alternatively, 10^{0.6} = (10^{0.3})^2. Given approximately:

Log(4)=0.60, so 10^0.6≈4. So the answer could be approximately 4. But if keeping log , then 10^{0.6}, but maybe for accuracy's sake, the answer is 3.98 times, but since it's an exact exponent, perhaps writing 10^{0.6} as \boxed{10^{0.6}} or 3.98 in decimal.

But let me verify once more. Alternatively, maybe there's an error here. Let me check:

Original derivation:

Star 1:
 [Si/Fe}]=0.3
 [Fe/H]=0 ⇒[Fe/H}=log(fFe) - log(fFe_sun)=0 ⇒ fFe = fFe_sun
 [Si/Fe}=log(fSi/fFe) - log(fSi_sun/fFe_sun)=0.3=>log((fSi/fFe)/(fSi_sun/fFe_sun))=0.3

 Since fFe = fFe_sun, the ratio becomes (fSi)/(fSi_sun) = 10^0.3 ⇒ fSi1 = 10^0.3× fSi_sun.

Star 2：
[Mg/Si}]=0.3， [Mg/H}=0.

[Mg/H}=0 ⇒ fMg= fMg_sun.

[Mg/Si}=log(fMg/fSi) - log(fMg_sun/fSi_sun)}=0.3 ⇒ log( (fMg /fSi)/(fMg_sun/fSi_sun) ) =0.3 => (fMg/fSi)=10^{0.3}× fMg_sun/fSi_sun.

But since fMg = fMg_sun,

=> fMg_sun/fSi_2=10^{0.3} fMg_sun/fSi_sun ⇒

 =>1/fSi_2=10^{0.3}/ fSi_sun ⇒ fSi_2= fSi_sun /10^{0.3} = fSi_sun ×10^{-0.3}

Thus, measuring both％

fSi1 / fSi2= (10^{0.3}fSi_sun) / (10^{-0.3}fSi_sun )= 10^{0.6} ≈3.98

Therefore, the answer is approximately 4, but since the question is from astronomy, inverse exams would prefer the exact expression in terms of exponent or log, so 10^{0.6}. But let me check how the elemental abundance is defined. Alternative path.

Second approach:

For [Si/Fe] in Star 1: 0.3 dex.

Star 1 also has [Fe/H}=0.

Star 1's Silicon abundance is [Si/H} = [Si/Fe} + [Fe/H} ]=0.3 +0=0.3 (dex). So in terms of nSi/nH, Sistar1= nSi_sun/nH_sun ×10^{0.3}

Star 2 has [Mg/H} =0 and [Mg/Si}]=0.3.

First, compute [Si/H}, then connect to Star 2's [Si/H}.

[Mg/Si}=0.3= [Mg/H} −[Si/H}].

Wait, yes, since[A/B} = [A/H} -[B/H}.

Thus, [Mg/Si}= [Mg/H} −[Si/H}.

Given that [Mg/Si}=0.3 and [Mg/H}=0,

Thus, 0.3=0 − [Si/H}, which implies [Si/H}=−0.3.

Therefore, Star2's [Si/H}=-0.3, meaning nSi/nH=10^{-0.3} ×nSi_sun/nH_sun

Compare with Star1's [Si/H}=0.3: nSi/nH1=10^{0.3} ×nSi_sun/nH_sun

Assuming Sun’s nSi_sun/nH_sun.
However, since both have nH as solar, given their [Fe/H} and [Mg/H} are just deviations but not in H. So for both stars, nH is as solar. Hence, the ratio (nSi1 *nH_sun/(nH1)) / (nSi2 *nH_sun/(nH2)) )= (nSi1/nSi2} ) as (nH1=nH2 =nH_sun)

But nH1 and nH2 are the same, yes. Therefore:

nSi1/nSi2= (nSi1/nH)/(nSi2/nH)= (fSi1)/fSi2 )=10^{0.6} which matches the previous calculation.

So either way, that holds.

Therefore, the ratio is 10^{0.6}.

So confirming that.

Since 10^{0.6}=antilog(0.6)=approx 3.98, but the problem doesn't specify to numerical value, so should we present it in exponent or decimal?

Alternatively, maybe more accurately:

log_{10}(nSi_1/nSi_2)=0.6

But the problem just asks for the ratio of Si atoms, so this would be 10^{0.6}

But the question comes from astrophysics and wants an exact answer. Let me check if 10^{0.6} is acceptable, yes, in these sciences we leave sometimes in dex form, but here they're asking for the ratio of atoms. 10^{0.6} is natural, and as approximately 4, but it's possible that the answer is expected to write 10^{0.6}.

Alternatively, as:

0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6 dex difference.

But I think the answer is 10^{0.6}, which we can write as 10^{3/5}, but we can leave it as 10^{0.6}.

Hence, boxed: \boxed{10^{0.6}} OR \boxed{10^{3/5}}, but exponent decimal is more common.

Alternatively, if the student wants to evaluate numerically, 10^0.6 ≈3.98≈4. or the exact expression. The problem states "calculate the ratio of silicon atoms", so precisely it would be 10^{0.6} if they permit the symbolic answer. However, being astronomy context sometimes decimals might be more acceptable, though likely adhere to exact exponent. Alternatively, when teaching classes, sometimes accept both, but need to see exact answer preferred.

Wait the problem says "calculate the ratio", but given that the answer is a round exponent 0.6, perhaps they accept the exact exponential factor. So the answer is \boxed{10^{0.6}}.

Let me parse the problem again carefully.\n\nWait, have they missed giving us the solar [Si/H]? Because we need to calculate how much Si each star has. Because Star_1 has Si relative to Fe given, but Fe is given relative to H. But to get [Si/H], you need both.\n\nWait, but maybe the notation doesn\'t require the Sun\'s Si abundance. Let me think:\n\nKnow Star_1\'s [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe abundance same as Sun.\n\nStar_1\'s [Si/Fe] is +0.3, so the Si/Fe ratio is 10^0.3 times solar. Since Fe is solar, then their Si must be 10^0.3 times solar Si. Hence, nSi_1 / nSi_sun = 10^0.3.\n\nBut Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, meaning their Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 times the solar Mg/Si ratio. Also, [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so Mg abundance is same as solar.\n\nConsider that if [Mg/H]_2 = 0, then (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun. Their [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3:\n\n[Mg/Si]_2 = log[(nMg/nSi)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_sun] = 0.3.\n\nTherefore, [(nMg/nSi)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_sun] = 10^0.3, so (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3*(nMg/nSi)_sun.\n\nBut since (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun = nMg_sun / nH_sun.\n\nLet me work this out step by step. For Star_2:\n\nGiven [Mg/H]_2 = 0 => (nMg/nH)_2 = solar, so same as Sun. Meanwhile, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.\n\nThe ratio [Mg/Si] is calculated as log[(Mg/Si)_star / (Mg/Si)_sun] = 0.3. Hence, (Mg/Si)_star = (Mg/Si)_sun * 10^0.3, which is the same as:\n\n(nMg_2 / nSi_2) = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.\n\nBut (nMg_2 / nH_2) = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) because [Mg/H]_2 = 0.\n\nAssuming that for Star_2, if H is the same scaling as Sun? Wait, in stellar abundances, [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. So (nX/nH) = 10^{[X/H]}*(nX/nH)_sun.\n\nIf [Mg/H]_2 = 0, then (nMg_2 / nH_2) = (nMg_sun / nH_sun). Therefore, nH_2 here might not necessarily be same as solar? Wait, but abundance ratios are based on number densities relative to H. So if (nMg_2/nH_2) is the same as solar, that can occur either if Mg and H are both enhanced or depleted proportionally, but in Metalicity terms, [X/H] being zero implies the ratio of X to H is solar, regardless of the absolute value of H. So assuming that in Star 2 in order to have [Mg/H] = 0, nMg/nH = solar. Therefore, However, for Star 2:\n\nFrom [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 => (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^0.3.\n\nBut nMg_2 / nH_2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun), so (nMg_2) = (nH_2) * (nMg_sun / nH_sun).\n\nMeanwhile, (nMg_2 / nSi_2) is known as above. Therefore:\n\n(nH_2 * nMg_sun / nH_sun ) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.\n\nCanceling nMg_sun from both sides (since it\'s nonzero):\n\n(nH_2 / nH_sun) / nSi_2 = (1 / nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.\n\nRearranged:\n\nnSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun ) * nSi_sun / 10^0.3.\n\nBut here nH_2 / nH_sun—what do I know about that? Unless if we have [Fe/H] or some other [X/H] for Star_2, but [Mg/H]_2 = 0. We don\'t have [Fe/H] for Star_2. Wait, but maybe hydrogen itself isn\'t being tracked here. Unless one can assume that for Star_2, in the metallicity [Fe/H], but we don\'t know. Let\'s pause and see.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s more straightforward. Let\'s first handle Star_1 and Star_2 separately and then compute nSi_1 and nSi_2 relative to nSolar, then take the ratio.\n\nFor Star_1:\n\nWe have:\n\n[Fe/H]_1 = 0 => (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.\n\nPlus:\n\n[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

So,\n\n(nSi/nFe)_sun = ( (nSi/nH)_sun ) / ( (Fe/nH)_sun ) )\n\nSo,\n\n(nSi/nFe)_sun = (10^{(12 + log(nSi/nH) - 12)} ) / (10^{(12 + log(nFe/nH) - 12)} )?\n\nWait, in the problem statement:\n\nSun\'s 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 => log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5.\n\nSimilarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 ⇒ log(nMg/nH) = -5.\n\nBut we aren\'t given Sun\'s [Si/H], which might complicate things. Wait, how can that actually be possible? Since the problem gives us solar abundances for Fe and Mg but not for Si, yet wants us to compute the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2.\n\nBut maybe there\'s a way to handle Si abundance using the Mg and Fe data?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they expect a relative answer regardless of Sun\'s absolute Si value. Let me check.\n\nBecause if I can express both nSi_1 and nSi_2 relative to something else that cancels out when taking the ratio between the stars, maybe?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps that when I take nSi_1/nSi_2, the solar Si and H values cancel.\n\nThus, let\'s process Star_1 first.\n\nStar_1:\n\n- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 ⇒ (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun (Which is 10^-4.5)\n\n- [Si/Fe]_1 = +0.3. Hence,\n\nlog[(nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun] = 0.3⇒\n(nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.\n\nBut (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun.\n\nSo (nSi/nFe)_sun = [Si/H]_sun / [Fe/H]_sun.\n\nWait, but with logarithmic notations. Alternatively, if I denote solar abundance ratios:\n\n([Si/Fe])_sun is log[(nSi/nFe)_sun] ...\n\nBut again, the problem is perhaps if we don’t know [Si/H]_sun. Let me think otherwise.\n\nBecause (nSi/nFe)_1 is applied. Remember for Star_1:\n\n(nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun = 10^-4.5.\n\nStar_1 [Si/Fe] is: (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi/nFe)_sun.\n\nBut (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun. Therefore:\n\n(nSi/nFe)_sun = ( (10^{log(nSi/nH)_sun}) ) / (10^{-4.5}) )\n\nBut log(nSi/nH)_sun is some value, which we can call log_Si_sun. But since we\'re not provided with log_Si_sun, the solar abundance of Si, perhaps we need to use some relation through Mg?\n\nWait, for Sun: [A/H] = log(nA/nH)_sun - log(nA/nH)_sol_another? Well, in standard terms, solar abundances are known. But the problem has only given us the Mg and Fe.\n\nIs there a standard abundance ratio that I should assume, like the Mg/Si ratio in the Sun?\n\nAlternatively, if nMg_sun/nSi_sun is known from the given data? Wait. For the Sun:\n\nGiven 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 ⇒ log(nFe/nH)sun = -4.5\n\n12 + log(nMg/nH)sun = 7 ⇒ log(nMg/nH)sun = -5.0\n\nSo, exprimé in terms of number ratios:\n\nnFe/nH (sun) = 10⁻⁴·⁵\n\nnMg/nH (sun) = 10⁻⁵\n\nIf only we knew nSi/nH (sun), our problems would be over, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps in Star_2 we can find a relation involving Si and Mg.\n\nWait for Star_2:\n\n[Mg/H]2 = 0 ⇒ (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun = 10^-5.\n\n[Mg/Si]_2 = +0.3: So,\n\nlog[(nMg/nSi)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_sun] = 0.3 ⇒\n\n(nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^0.3\n\nBut (nMg/nH)_2 is solar: (nMg/nH)_2 = 10^-5\n\nThus, from Star_2:\n\n(nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^0.3 ⇒\n\nBut (nMg/nSi)_2 is equal to (nMg/nH)_2 / (nSi/nH)_2 =\n\n(10^-5) / (nSi/nH)_2\n\nTherefore:\n\n(10^-5) / (nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^0.3\n\nDoesn\'t (nMg/nSi)_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun) )\n\n= (10^-5)/(nSi/nH)_sun)\n\nHence substituting:\n\n(10^-5)/(nSi/nH)_star2 = [ (10^-5)/(nSi/nH)_sun ) ] * 10^0.3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by (nSi/nH)_star2 and divide both sides by [ (10^-5)/nSi/sun * 10^0.3 ) ]:\n\nBy handling algebra, we have:\n\n10^-5 / (nSi/nH)_star2 = [10^-5 / (nSi/nH)_sun ] * 10^0.3 ⇒\n\nShift terms around,\n\n(nSi/nH)_star2 = 10^-5 / [ (10^-5 / (nSi/nH)_sun ) * 10^0.3 ] ⇒\n\n(nSi/nH)_star2 = (nSi/nH)_sun / 10^0.3.\n\nThus, (nSi/nH)_star2 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{-0.3}\n\nThus, Star_2\'s [Si/H] is [Si/H]_2 = log[(nSi/nH)_2 / (nSi/nH)_sun] = log[10^{-0.3}] = -0.3.\n\nTherefore, the Si abundance in Star_2 is -0.3 dex compared to solar.\n\nSimilarly, for Star_1, earlier step:\n\n(nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3 =\n\n[ (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun ] * 10^0.3.\n\nBut (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.\n\nTherefore, let\'s compute (nSi/nH)_1:\n\n(nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1\n\n= [ (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3 ] * (nFe/nH)_sun\n\n= [ (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun * 10^0.3 ] * (nFe/nH)_sun\n\n= (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^0.3.\n\nHence, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^0.3 ⇒ [Si/H]_1 = +0.3.\n\nThus, Star_1 has a silicon abundance of +0.3 dex relative to solar, and Star_2 has a silicon abundance of -0.3 dex relative to solar.\n\nTherefore, even without knowing the absolute solar abundance of Si, when we take the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2, which is [ (nSi/nH)_1 * nH_1 ] / [ (nSi/nH)_2 * nH_2 ].\n\nBut this seems complicated because each star’s hydrogen abundance nH might be different, hence affecting the ratio. Wait, but in atomic abundances, when you state [X/H], it implies (nX/nH)star / (nX/nH)sun = 10^[X/H]. So while the actual hydrogen densities in stars can vary, the abundance ratios [X/H] already normalize by the solar nH proportion?\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nIn most astrophysical contexts, [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun, which is equivalent to log( (nX/nH)_star / (nX/nH)_sun )\n\nSo that (nX_*/nH_*) = (nX/nH)_sun * 10^[X/H].\n\nBut note that nH here refers to the number density in the star\'s photosphere. So, if (nX_*/nH_*) = (nX/nH)_sun * 10^[X/H], that doesn\'t fix the total metallicity.\n\nBut, if for example, because metal abundances affect the overall number density.\n\nBut in reality, stars vary in [Fe/H], but Hydrogen’s abundance is the dominant component of the atmosphere (like the Sun\'s atmosphere is mostly Hydrogen). So, the Hydrogen number density doesn\'t change as drastically, and metallicity perturbations cause mostly changes in the heavy elements.\n\nTherefore, simplifying assumption: perhaps nH is same for both stars? But by default, here is no [H/H] given. Wait, but perhaps each "nH" here is considered as same as the sun. For example, if we say that differences in nX (metal abundances) are driven by changes in the metal part, not Hydrogen. Specifically, when [X/H] =-0.3, we’re saying that X is 0.5 times solar, written as X is 0.5 solar, and hydrogen is assumed to remain same.\n\nBut this isn\'t exactly accurate because if all metals are +0.3 dex simulated, then total nH must decrease to accommodate. However, given how H is dominant, even if the star has higher metal abundances, the total number of H atoms might not vary significantly. An approximation commonly made in statistical treatments is that nH ≈ nH_sun *\n\nWait, but we need to write the actual ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2.\n\nBut photosphere abundance analyses typically only determine (X/H), not the H itself. So Si abundance relative to H: (Si/H)_1 = 10^{[Si/H]_1} * (Si/H)_sun.\n\nBut for Star_1, we have [Si/H]_1 = 0.3? Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, for Star_1 do we explicitly know [Si/H]_1, not?\n\nWait, Wait! I had earlier computed for Star_1:\n\n(nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3}, so [Si/H]_1 is +0.3 dex.\n\nFor Star_2:\n\n(nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun *10^{-0.3}, so [Si/H]_2 is -0.3 dex.\n\nSo the ratio of nSi_1 to Su Si is 10^{0.3}, and Star_2\'s Si is 10^{-0.3} times Sun\'s. So, provided that nH_1 and nH_2 are equal to nH of the sun, Then the ratio of nSi_1 / nSi_2 would simply be (10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}) = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98. However, in reality [Fe/H]_1 is zero, so unless helium is varying, Hydrogen must vary. Wait.\n\nWait, let me recall that for metallicity [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log (nFe/nH)_sun.\n\nIf [Fe/H]_1 =0, that means (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun; the ratio.\n\nSimilarly, if for a star where ywe have added Si without altering Fe. But in Star_1.\n\nWait, this is getting potentially complicated. Let\'s backtrack and see if we can setup the problem for both stars:\n\nStar_1:\n\n[Fe/H] = 0, so (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun = 10^{-4.5}\n\n[Si/Fe]_1 = +0.3→ (nSi/nFe)_1 =10^{0.3}(nSi/nFe)_sun. This can be written as (nSi_1)/(nFe_1) = 10^{0.3}*(nSi_sun/nFe_sun). But (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun), so (nFe_1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1.\n\nTherefore, plugging into the previous equation:\n\nnSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} = substituting NeFe_1=(nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1:\n\nnSi_1 = nSi_sun/nFe_sun * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1 *10^{0.3} = (nSi_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1*10^{0.3}.\n\n Thus,\n\nnSi_1 = nH_1 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) 10^{0.3} \n\nBut what is nSi_sun/nH_sun?\n\nSimilarly, in Star_2:\n\n[Mg/H]_2 =0→(nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun=10^{-5}\n\n[Mg/Si]_2 = +0.3→ (nMg/Si)_2 = 10^{0.3}(nMg/Si)_sun. Let\'s break that down:\n\n(nMg/Nsi)_{star2}= (nMg/Si}_{sun}*10^{0.3}\n\nBut (nMg/Nsi})_{star2}= (nMg_2/nH_2)/(nSi_2/nH_2)= nMg_2 /nSi_2 And it erquates to (nMg/Si}_sun*10^{0.3})={ (nMg_sun/nH_sun) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) } *10^{0.3}\n\nThus,\n\nnMg_2/nSi_2 = [nMg_sun/nSi_sun] *10^{0.3}\n\nBut nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 （Because [Mg/H]2=0)\n\nSubstituting back into nMg_2/nSi_2=:\n\n( nMg_sun /nH_sun *nH_2 ) /nSi_2= [nMg_sun /nSi_sun] *10^{0.3}\n\nThis hypotenuse:\n\nnH_2 /nSi_2 = (nH_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}\n\nTherefore,\n\nnSi_2= nH_2 / (nH_sun/nSi_sun *10^{0.3} )= (nH_2 *nSi_sun ) / (nH_sun*10^{0.3})\n\nThus，nSi_2 =nH_2*(nSi_sun/nH_sun)/10^{0.3}\n\n Therefore, combining both results,nSi_1 and nSi_2:\n\nnSi_1 = nH_1*(nSi_sun/nH_sun)*10^{0.3}\n\nnSi_2 =nH_2*(nSi_sun/nH_sun)/10^{0.3}\n\nThus the ratio is:\n\nnSi1/nSi2 = [nH1 /nH2 ]*(10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}))= [nH1 /nH2] *10^{0.6}\n\nSo this ratio depends on the ratio of H number densities between the two stars. Do we have any information on the H abundance in the two stars\' atmospheres?\n\nAlternatively, since we *don’t* have [H/H] given for either star, and assuming all H is logged at solar?\n\nIs there a metallicity effect here on the number density of H?\n\nWait typically, for a star’s atmosphere，if [Fe/H] is the abundance，and [X/Fe] increased，then [X/H] also increases as well, but H may decrease inversely in nH.\n\nHowever, astrophysically, when we say [Fe/H] =0，i.e., Fe abundance same as sun， which for sources composition having H do minant. Thus,H in star x sameas suni...\n\nBut this is a often a sloggish approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to assume that in the giants or dwarf stars,i.e., the problem doesn\'t state the evolutionary stage. But if there\'s nothing to indicate that the hydrogen content varies between thestellar atmospheres, and usualpractice see abundances relative solar with assuming thickness i e ei.,mmetallcity is often considered to preserving hydrogen\'s abundance dominant so decrease in metallicity [M/H] = -1.0 means， metals are 10% of solar，but hydrogen adjusted such that nH is roughly keeping overall density.\n\nBut precise computation would aster. However, maybe given to make simplifying assumption nH1 = nH2 = nH_sun.\n\nIs this assumption. Common in undergradproblems that when asked abundance ratios but "nH" variation is negligible.\n\nBut does that hold here?\n\nMetallicity for Star 1 is:\n\nFe/H is solar; Star1 has [Fe/H] =0. So the total metallicity may be similar to the Sun.However, its silicon to iron ratio is 0.3 higher. Since iron peak elements in the Sun:  , so perhaps for Star_1, having a higher silicon compared to iron would still result in a higher overall metalllicity. But unless the shift in abundance of silicon relative to iron causes a significant change in total heavy element abundance despite fe being solar.\n\nIf we accept that hydrogen abundance would remain approx same as the sum of in star\'s atmosphere isHydrogen-Julia common.ans chi for in abs 112 solar.\n\nHence, in order to finalize the answer ratio*, we might assume that nH1 = nH2 = nH_sun*, then.\n\nBut that would req:\n\nUnder that assumption, nSi1/nSi2 = ( nH_sun * (nSi_sun/nH_sun )*10^0.3 ) / ( nH_sun *(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ) /10^0.3 )= (10^{0.3} ) / (10^{-0.3})=10^{0.6}=3.98\n\nTherefore,≈4.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundances and their relationship to the solar abundances.

1. **Star_1 Analysis:**
   - \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\): The iron abundance relative to hydrogen is solar, so \((nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_\odot\).
   - \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\): The silicon to iron ratio is \(10^{0.3}\) times the solar ratio. Since \((nFe/nH)_1\) is solar, \((nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_\odot \times 10^{0.3}\).

2. **Star_2 Analysis:**
   - \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\): The magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is solar, so \((nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_\odot\).
   - \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\): The magnesium to silicon ratio is \(10^{0.3}\) times the solar ratio. Using the solar magnesium abundance, we find \((nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_\odot \times 10^{-0.3}\).

3. **Silicon Abundance Ratio:**
   - For Star_1: \((nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_\odot \times 10^{0.3}\)
   - For Star_2: \((nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_\odot \times 10^{-0.3}\)
   - The ratio of silicon atoms is \(\frac{(nSi/nH)_1}{(nSi/nH)_2} = \frac{(nSi/nH)_\odot \times 10^{0.3}}{(nSi/nH)_\odot \times 10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6}\).

Thus, the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is \(\boxed{10^{0.6}}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

but wait, if we need (nSi/nFe)_sun to move forward, perhaps we can express things in terms of the solar abundances? If we are lacking the solar Si abundance, but might we compute nSi relative to H in each star and then relate them through [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si]? Let me parse the problem again carefully.

Wait, have they missed giving us the solar [Si/H]? Because we need to calculate how much Si each star has. Because Star_1 has Si relative to Fe given, but Fe is given relative to H. But to get [Si/H], you need both.

Wait, but maybe the notation doesn't require the Sun's Si abundance. Let me think:

Know Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe abundance same as Sun.

Star_1's [Si/Fe] is +0.3, so the Si/Fe ratio is 10^0.3 times solar. Since Fe is solar, then their Si must be 10^0.3 times solar Si. Hence, nSi_1 / nSi_sun = 10^0.3.

But Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, meaning their Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 times the solar Mg/Si ratio. Also, [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so Mg abundance is same as solar.

Consider that if [Mg/H]_2 = 0, then (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun. Their [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3:

[Mg/Si]_2 = log[(nMg/nSi)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_sun] = 0.3.

Therefore, [(nMg/nSi)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_sun] = 10^0.3, so (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3*(nMg/nSi)_sun.

But since (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun = nMg_sun / nH_sun.

Let me work this out step by step. For Star_2:

Given [Mg/H]_2 = 0 => (nMg/nH)_2 = solar, so same as Sun. Meanwhile, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

The ratio [Mg/Si] is calculated as log[(Mg/Si)_star / (Mg/Si)_sun] = 0.3. Hence, (Mg/Si)_star = (Mg/Si)_sun * 10^0.3, which is the same as:

(nMg_2 / nSi_2) = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

But (nMg_2 / nH_2) = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) because [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

Assuming that for Star_2, if H is the same scaling as Sun? Wait, in stellar abundances, [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. So (nX/nH) = 10^{[X/H]}*(nX/nH)_sun.

If [Mg/H]_2 = 0, then (nMg_2 / nH_2) = (nMg_sun / nH_sun). Therefore, nH_2 here might not necessarily be same as solar? Wait, but abundance ratios are based on number densities relative to H. So if (nMg_2/nH_2) is the same as solar, that can occur either if Mg and H are both enhanced or depleted proportionally, but in Metalicity terms, [X/H] being zero implies the ratio of X to H is solar, regardless of the absolute value of H. So assuming that in Star 2 in order to have [Mg/H] = 0, nMg/nH = solar. Therefore, However, for Star 2:

From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 => (nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^0.3.

But nMg_2 / nH_2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun), so (nMg_2) = (nH_2) * (nMg_sun / nH_sun).

Meanwhile, (nMg_2 / nSi_2) is known as above. Therefore:

(nH_2 * nMg_sun / nH_sun ) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun / nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Canceling nMg_sun from both sides (since it's nonzero):

(nH_2 / nH_sun) / nSi_2 = (1 / nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Rearranged:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun ) * nSi_sun / 10^0.3.

But here nH_2 / nH_sun—what do I know about that? Unless if we have [Fe/H] or some other [X/H] for Star_2, but [Mg/H]_2 = 0. We don't have [Fe/H] for Star_2. Wait, but maybe hydrogen itself isn't being tracked here. Unless one can assume that for Star_2, in the metallicity [Fe/H], but we don't know. Let's pause and see.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward. Let's first handle Star_1 and Star_2 separately and then compute nSi_1 and nSi_2 relative to nSolar, then take the ratio.

For Star_1:

We have:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 => (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

Plus:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Let's write:

log10( (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun ) = 0.3 => (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun is (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun. So,

(nSi/nFe)_sun = ( (nSi/nH)_sun ) / ( (Fe/nH)_sun ) )

So,

(nSi/nFe)_sun = (10^{(12 + log(nSi/nH) - 12)} ) / (10^{(12 + log(nFe/nH) - 12)} )?

Wait, in the problem statement:

Sun's 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 => log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5.

Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 ⇒ log(nMg/nH) = -5.

But we aren't given Sun's [Si/H], which might complicate things. Wait, how can that actually be possible? Since the problem gives us solar abundances for Fe and Mg but not for Si, yet wants us to compute the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2.

But maybe there's a way to handle Si abundance using the Mg and Fe data?

Alternatively, perhaps they expect a relative answer regardless of Sun's absolute Si value. Let me check.

Because if I can express both nSi_1 and nSi_2 relative to something else that cancels out when taking the ratio between the stars, maybe?

Alternatively, perhaps that when I take nSi_1/nSi_2, the solar Si and H values cancel.

Thus, let's process Star_1 first.

Star_1:

- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 ⇒ (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun (Which is 10^-4.5)

- [Si/Fe]_1 = +0.3. Hence,

log[(nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun] = 0.3⇒
(nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun.

So (nSi/nFe)_sun = [Si/H]_sun / [Fe/H]_sun.

Wait, but with logarithmic notations. Alternatively, if I denote solar abundance ratios:

([Si/Fe])_sun is log[(nSi/nFe)_sun] ...

But again, the problem is perhaps if we don’t know [Si/H]_sun. Let me think otherwise.

Because (nSi/nFe)_1 is applied. Remember for Star_1:

(nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun = 10^-4.5.

Star_1 [Si/Fe] is: (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun. Therefore:

(nSi/nFe)_sun = ( (10^{log(nSi/nH)_sun}) ) / (10^{-4.5}) )

But log(nSi/nH)_sun is some value, which we can call log_Si_sun. But since we're not provided with log_Si_sun, the solar abundance of Si, perhaps we need to use some relation through Mg?

Wait, for Sun: [A/H] = log(nA/nH)_sun - log(nA/nH)_sol_another? Well, in standard terms, solar abundances are known. But the problem has only given us the Mg and Fe.

Is there a standard abundance ratio that I should assume, like the Mg/Si ratio in the Sun?

Alternatively, if nMg_sun/nSi_sun is known from the given data? Wait. For the Sun:

Given 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 ⇒ log(nFe/nH)sun = -4.5

12 + log(nMg/nH)sun = 7 ⇒ log(nMg/nH)sun = -5.0

So, exprimé in terms of number ratios:

nFe/nH (sun) = 10⁻⁴·⁵

nMg/nH (sun) = 10⁻⁵

If only we knew nSi/nH (sun), our problems would be over, but how?

Wait, perhaps in Star_2 we can find a relation involving Si and Mg.

Wait for Star_2:

[Mg/H]2 = 0 ⇒ (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun = 10^-5.

[Mg/Si]_2 = +0.3: So,

log[(nMg/nSi)_2 / (nMg/nSi)_sun] = 0.3 ⇒

(nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^0.3

But (nMg/nH)_2 is solar: (nMg/nH)_2 = 10^-5

Thus, from Star_2:

(nMg/nSi)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^0.3 ⇒

But (nMg/nSi)_2 is equal to (nMg/nH)_2 / (nSi/nH)_2 =

(10^-5) / (nSi/nH)_2

Therefore:

(10^-5) / (nSi/nH)_2 = (nMg/nSi)_sun * 10^0.3

Doesn't (nMg/nSi)_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun) )

= (10^-5)/(nSi/nH)_sun)

Hence substituting:

(10^-5)/(nSi/nH)_star2 = [ (10^-5)/(nSi/nH)_sun ) ] * 10^0.3 )

Multiply both sides by (nSi/nH)_star2 and divide both sides by [ (10^-5)/nSi/sun * 10^0.3 ) ]:

By handling algebra, we have:

10^-5 / (nSi/nH)_star2 = [10^-5 / (nSi/nH)_sun ] * 10^0.3 ⇒

Shift terms around,

(nSi/nH)_star2 = 10^-5 / [ (10^-5 / (nSi/nH)_sun ) * 10^0.3 ] ⇒

(nSi/nH)_star2 = (nSi/nH)_sun / 10^0.3.

Thus, (nSi/nH)_star2 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{-0.3}

Thus, Star_2's [Si/H] is [Si/H]_2 = log[(nSi/nH)_2 / (nSi/nH)_sun] = log[10^{-0.3}] = -0.3.

Therefore, the Si abundance in Star_2 is -0.3 dex compared to solar.

Similarly, for Star_1, earlier step:

(nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3 =

[ (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun ] * 10^0.3.

But (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

Therefore, let's compute (nSi/nH)_1:

(nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_1 * (nFe/nH)_1

= [ (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3 ] * (nFe/nH)_sun

= [ (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun * 10^0.3 ] * (nFe/nH)_sun

= (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^0.3.

Hence, (nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^0.3 ⇒ [Si/H]_1 = +0.3.

Thus, Star_1 has a silicon abundance of +0.3 dex relative to solar, and Star_2 has a silicon abundance of -0.3 dex relative to solar.

Therefore, even without knowing the absolute solar abundance of Si, when we take the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2, which is [ (nSi/nH)_1 * nH_1 ] / [ (nSi/nH)_2 * nH_2 ].

But this seems complicated because each star’s hydrogen abundance nH might be different, hence affecting the ratio. Wait, but in atomic abundances, when you state [X/H], it implies (nX/nH)star / (nX/nH)sun = 10^[X/H]. So while the actual hydrogen densities in stars can vary, the abundance ratios [X/H] already normalize by the solar nH proportion?

Wait, let me clarify.

In most astrophysical contexts, [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun, which is equivalent to log( (nX/nH)_star / (nX/nH)_sun )

So that (nX_*/nH_*) = (nX/nH)_sun * 10^[X/H].

But note that nH here refers to the number density in the star's photosphere. So, if (nX_*/nH_*) = (nX/nH)_sun * 10^[X/H], that doesn't fix the total metallicity.

But, if for example, because metal abundances affect the overall number density.

But in reality, stars vary in [Fe/H], but Hydrogen’s abundance is the dominant component of the atmosphere (like the Sun's atmosphere is mostly Hydrogen). So, the Hydrogen number density doesn't change as drastically, and metallicity perturbations cause mostly changes in the heavy elements.

Therefore, simplifying assumption: perhaps nH is same for both stars? But by default, here is no [H/H] given. Wait, but perhaps each "nH" here is considered as same as the sun. For example, if we say that differences in nX (metal abundances) are driven by changes in the metal part, not Hydrogen. Specifically, when [X/H] =-0.3, we’re saying that X is 0.5 times solar, written as X is 0.5 solar, and hydrogen is assumed to remain same.

But this isn't exactly accurate because if all metals are +0.3 dex simulated, then total nH must decrease to accommodate. However, given how H is dominant, even if the star has higher metal abundances, the total number of H atoms might not vary significantly. An approximation commonly made in statistical treatments is that nH ≈ nH_sun *

Wait, but we need to write the actual ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2.

But photosphere abundance analyses typically only determine (X/H), not the H itself. So Si abundance relative to H: (Si/H)_1 = 10^{[Si/H]_1} * (Si/H)_sun.

But for Star_1, we have [Si/H]_1 = 0.3? Wait, hold on.

Wait, for Star_1 do we explicitly know [Si/H]_1, not?

Wait, Wait! I had earlier computed for Star_1:

(nSi/nH)_1 = (nSi/nH)_sun * 10^{0.3}, so [Si/H]_1 is +0.3 dex.

For Star_2:

(nSi/nH)_2 = (nSi/nH)_sun *10^{-0.3}, so [Si/H]_2 is -0.3 dex.

So the ratio of nSi_1 to Su Si is 10^{0.3}, and Star_2's Si is 10^{-0.3} times Sun's. So, provided that nH_1 and nH_2 are equal to nH of the sun, Then the ratio of nSi_1 / nSi_2 would simply be (10^{0.3} / 10^{-0.3}) = 10^{0.6} ≈3.98. However, in reality [Fe/H]_1 is zero, so unless helium is varying, Hydrogen must vary. Wait.

Wait, let me recall that for metallicity [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log (nFe/nH)_sun.

If [Fe/H]_1 =0, that means (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun; the ratio.

Similarly, if for a star where ywe have added Si without altering Fe. But in Star_1.

Wait, this is getting potentially complicated. Let's backtrack and see if we can setup the problem for both stars:

Star_1:

[Fe/H] = 0, so (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun = 10^{-4.5}

[Si/Fe]_1 = +0.3→ (nSi/nFe)_1 =10^{0.3}(nSi/nFe)_sun. This can be written as (nSi_1)/(nFe_1) = 10^{0.3}*(nSi_sun/nFe_sun). But (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun), so (nFe_1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1.

Therefore, plugging into the previous equation:

nSi_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun)*nFe_1 * 10^{0.3} = substituting NeFe_1=(nFe_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1:

nSi_1 = nSi_sun/nFe_sun * (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1 *10^{0.3} = (nSi_sun/nH_sun)*nH_1*10^{0.3}.

 Thus,

nSi_1 = nH_1 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) 10^{0.3} 

But what is nSi_sun/nH_sun?

Similarly, in Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 =0→(nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun=10^{-5}

[Mg/Si]_2 = +0.3→ (nMg/Si)_2 = 10^{0.3}(nMg/Si)_sun. Let's break that down:

(nMg/Nsi)_{star2}= (nMg/Si}_{sun}*10^{0.3}

But (nMg/Nsi})_{star2}= (nMg_2/nH_2)/(nSi_2/nH_2)= nMg_2 /nSi_2 And it erquates to (nMg/Si}_sun*10^{0.3})={ (nMg_sun/nH_sun) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) } *10^{0.3}

Thus,

nMg_2/nSi_2 = [nMg_sun/nSi_sun] *10^{0.3}

But nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 （Because [Mg/H]2=0)

Substituting back into nMg_2/nSi_2=:

( nMg_sun /nH_sun *nH_2 ) /nSi_2= [nMg_sun /nSi_sun] *10^{0.3}

This hypotenuse:

nH_2 /nSi_2 = (nH_sun/nSi_sun) *10^{0.3}

Therefore,

nSi_2= nH_2 / (nH_sun/nSi_sun *10^{0.3} )= (nH_2 *nSi_sun ) / (nH_sun*10^{0.3})

Thus，nSi_2 =nH_2*(nSi_sun/nH_sun)/10^{0.3}

 Therefore, combining both results,nSi_1 and nSi_2:

nSi_1 = nH_1*(nSi_sun/nH_sun)*10^{0.3}

nSi_2 =nH_2*(nSi_sun/nH_sun)/10^{0.3}

Thus the ratio is:

nSi1/nSi2 = [nH1 /nH2 ]*(10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}))= [nH1 /nH2] *10^{0.6}

So this ratio depends on the ratio of H number densities between the two stars. Do we have any information on the H abundance in the two stars' atmospheres?

Alternatively, since we *don’t* have [H/H] given for either star, and assuming all H is logged at solar?

Is there a metallicity effect here on the number density of H?

Wait typically, for a star’s atmosphere，if [Fe/H] is the abundance，and [X/Fe] increased，then [X/H] also increases as well, but H may decrease inversely in nH.

However, astrophysically, when we say [Fe/H] =0，i.e., Fe abundance same as sun， which for sources composition having H do minant. Thus,H in star x sameas suni...

But this is a often a sloggish approximation.

Alternatively, maybe we need to assume that in the giants or dwarf stars,i.e., the problem doesn't state the evolutionary stage. But if there's nothing to indicate that the hydrogen content varies between thestellar atmospheres, and usualpractice see abundances relative solar with assuming thickness i e ei.,mmetallcity is often considered to preserving hydrogen's abundance dominant so decrease in metallicity [M/H] = -1.0 means， metals are 10% of solar，but hydrogen adjusted such that nH is roughly keeping overall density.

But precise computation would aster. However, maybe given to make simplifying assumption nH1 = nH2 = nH_sun.

Is this assumption. Common in undergradproblems that when asked abundance ratios but "nH" variation is negligible.

But does that hold here?

Metallicity for Star 1 is:

Fe/H is solar; Star1 has [Fe/H] =0. So the total metallicity may be similar to the Sun.However, its silicon to iron ratio is 0.3 higher. Since iron peak elements in the Sun:  , so perhaps for Star_1, having a higher silicon compared to iron would still result in a higher overall metalllicity. But unless the shift in abundance of silicon relative to iron causes a significant change in total heavy element abundance despite fe being solar.

If we accept that hydrogen abundance would remain approx same as the sum of in star's atmosphere isHydrogen-Julia common.ans chi for in abs 112 solar.

Hence, in order to finalize the answer ratio*, we might assume that nH1 = nH2 = nH_sun*, then.

But that would req:

Under that assumption, nSi1/nSi2 = ( nH_sun * (nSi_sun/nH_sun )*10^0.3 ) / ( nH_sun *(nSi_sun/nH_sun ) ) /10^0.3 )= (10^{0.3} ) / (10^{-0.3})=10^{0.6}=3.98

Therefore,≈4. From being both effects:但在Star1，allene／H 是 solar，then during the/Si/Fe is+0.3，that multiplies她們的 Si by 10^0.3 over solar. In Starkey2, [mg/s] +0.3，making their Si lower by 10^-0.3 than solar.

Thus combining both stars would have nSi 是一個 Si1star /sistar2 becomes  No, 10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3} =10^{0.6}=，

所以答案为10^(0.6)=antilog(0.6)=约为3.98≈4. }/>snippet "\boxed{}"致举棋不定的当或分母}

Hmm,但问题是题目提供了太阳的 Fe 和 Mg的含量。如果我们考虑alfa丰富度的，例如，在Star_2如果没有给出 [Fe/H]，我们可能需要确实中假设有些参数无法 no affecting但这里的构造似乎足够 Krondash做出来的使用举例。
