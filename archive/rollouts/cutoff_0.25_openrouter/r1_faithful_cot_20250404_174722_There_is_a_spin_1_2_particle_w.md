The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment \(\mu = \gamma S_z\) initially aligned with a magnetic field in the \( +Z \) direction. When the magnetic field is switched to \( +Y \) direction, we need to determine the oscillation frequency of the average \( z \)-component of the particle’s moment.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The initial Hamiltonian is \( H_{\text{initial}} = -\gamma B S_z \), where the particle is in the eigenstate \( |+z\rangle \).
   - The Hamiltonian changes to \( H_{\text{final}} = -\gamma B S_y \) when the magnetic field is switched to \( +Y \).

2. **Time Evolution**:
   - The initial state \( |+z\rangle \) is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of \( S_y \): \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \).
   - \( |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle) \).

3. **Eigenstate Evolution**:
   - The time evolution under \( H_{\text{final}} \) leads to phase factors for \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \):
     \[
     |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i \gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i \gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle \right)
     \]
   - Converting back to the \( z \)-basis results in:
     \[
     |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |+z\rangle - \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |-z\rangle
     \]

4. **Expectation Value of \( S_z \)**:
   - The expectation value \( \langle S_z \rangle \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
     \]
   - This shows oscillations with angular frequency \( \gamma B \).

5. **Oscillation Frequency**:
   - The angular frequency is \( \gamma B \), and the regular frequency (in Hz) is \( \frac{\gamma B}{2\pi} \).

Thus, the oscillation frequency of the average \( z \)-component of the particle’s moment is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\gamma B}{2\pi}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I have this problem here about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is originally aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Then the magnetic field is turned off and another one in the +Y direction is turned on, both with magnitude B. The question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the switch. I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, I remember that the magnetic moment is related to the spin operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment operator is given by mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S is the spin operator. In this case, since the initial magnetic field is along the Z-axis, the initial Hamiltonian would be H_initial = -mu · B = -gamma * B S_z, right?

Wait, actually, magnetic energy is usually given by the dot product of magnetic moment and the magnetic field, so H = -mu · B. So if the initial magnetic field is along +Z, then H_initial = -gamma * B S_z. Then the particle is initially in the ground state aligned with the magnetic field. Since it's spin-1/2, the eigenstates of S_z are |up> and |down> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So if the magnetic moment is aligned with +Z, then the initial state is |up> with S_z = ħ/2. So that's the initial state.

Now, when the magnetic field is suddenly switched off and a new one in the +Y direction is turned on. So the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma * B S_y.

Wait, same magnitude B? The problem states that both fields have the same magnitude, B. So we turn off the Z-field and turn on Y-field of same B. Now the question is about the time evolution of the average z-component of the particle's moment, <S_z>, after the switch. They mention that this average starts oscillating, and we need to find the oscillation frequency.

So first, this is a standard time evolution problem. The state is initially in the |up> state along Z. Then at t=0, the Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma B S_y. The state will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation under this new Hamiltonian.

So the initial state |psi(0)> = |+z> = |up> in the z-direction. Let's write this in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, which is in the y-direction. Because when the Hamiltonian changes, the new time evolution will depend on the eigenstates of the final Hamiltonian.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. If I can express the initial state |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>, then since these are eigenstates of H_final, their time evolution will just acquire phases. Then when you compute <S_z>, it might lead to oscillations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the Heisenberg picture, where we find the time evolution of the S_z operator under the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y.

Hmm. Let me think. So if we use the Heisenberg equation of motion, dS_z/dt = (1/iħ) [S_z, H]. Let's compute that.

But first, let's note the Hamiltonian after the switch: H = -gamma B S_y. The gyromagnetic ratio gamma relates the magnetic moment to the spin: mu = gamma S. Then, H = - mu · B = - gamma B S_y.

So now, the time evolution is governed by H = - gamma B S_y.

So in the Heisenberg picture, the operator S_z(t) = exp(i H t / ħ) S_z exp(-i H t / ħ).

To compute the time derivative, according to Heisenberg's equation: dS_z/dt = (1/iħ) [S_z, H]. Let me compute that commutator.

First, let's compute [S_z, H] = [S_z, - gamma B S_y] = - gamma B [S_z, S_y] = - gamma B (i ħ S_x), by the commutation relations of angular momentum operators. Recall that [S_i, S_j] = i ħ ε_ijk S_k, where ε_ijk is the Levi-Civita symbol.

So [S_z, S_y] = i ħ S_x. Wait, actually, verify: [S_x, S_y] = iħ S_z, so cyclic permutations. Let me be precise. Let's denote [S_i, S_j] = iħ ε_ijk S_k.

So [S_z, S_y] = iħ ε_zyx S_x = iħ * (-1) ε_zxy S_x = -iħ S_x.

Wait, epsilon_z_y_x. How's the Levi-Civita defined? The indices are z, y, x. The permutation from (x,y,z) to (z,y,x). Let me recall that epsilon_ijk is +1 for even permutations of (1,2,3), -1 for odd.

But here, the indexes are in the order z, y, x. Let's assign x=1, y=2, z=3. So the permutation is from (1,2,3) to (3,2,1). So positions 1 and 3 are swapped. That's an odd permutation. So epsilon_zyx = epsilon_3 2 1. So epsilon_312 would be equivalent? Wait, original ordering is (z,y,x) in term of 3,2,1.

Yes, so epsilon_321 = -1, since swapping 1 and 3 is one transposition, so two transpositions: 1<->2, 2<->3? Wait, no. Wait, the parity of the permutation is determined by the number of transpositions needed to sort the indices. For indices (3,2,1), to sort back to (1,2,3) can be done by first swapping 1 and 3: (1,2,3) → swapping 1 and 3 gives (3,2,1). Since it's an odd number of transpositions (1), the Levi-Civita symbol is -1.

Therefore, [S_z, S_y] = iħ epsilon_zyx S_x = iħ (-1) S_x = -iħ S_x. Therefore, [S_z, H] = -gamma B [S_z, S_y] = -gamma B (-iħ S_x) = i gamma B ħ S_x.

Putting this back into Heisenberg's equation: dS_z/dt = (1/iħ)(i gamma B ħ S_x) )= gamma B S_x.

Similarly, the time derivative of S_z is gamma B S_x.

But we need to compute dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x. Now, but we can also compute the time derivative of S_x. Let's do that: dS_x/dt = (1/iħ)[S_x, H] = (1/iħ)[S_x, -gamma B S_y] = (-gamma B / iħ) [S_x, S_y] = (-gamma B / iħ)(iħ S_z) = -gamma B S_z.

Similarly, dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z.

So now we have a system of differential equations:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x.

dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z.

These are the Heisenberg equations. Let me note that these equations are similar to classical rotations. Let me write them:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x,

dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z.

This is a set of coupled differential equations. Let me take the second derivative of S_z:

d²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (-gamma B S_z) = - (gamma B)^2 S_z.

Therefore, the equation governing S_z is:

d²S_z/dt² + (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0.

This is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency (gamma B).

Thus, the solution is:

S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).

Whereas, because this is an operator equation, but when considering the expectation value, since the time evolution for the operators in Heisenberg picture, and the expectation values must satisfy the same equations.

Therefore, the expectation value <S_z(t)> in the Heisenberg picture would satisfy the same differential equation:

d²<S_z>/dt² + (gamma B)^2 <S_z> = 0.

Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but in this case, but gamma is actually the gyromagnetic ratio. For a spin-1/2 particle, the gyromagnetic ratio gamma is related to the spin g-factor. The actual magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S, and the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B.

But for a spin-1/2 particle like an electron, the gyromagnetic ratio gamma is for the electron. But perhaps we have here just a spin-1/2 with given gamma. However, since the problem says "gamma*Sz" in the initial description: "mu (= gamma*Sz)", so here, the magnetic moment operator is given as mu = gamma S_z, but maybe actually it's gamma S, since the magnetic moment is a vector. Let me check the original problem statement.

The problem states: "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction." Wait, this seems wrong. Wait, magnetic moment is a vector. If it's gamma*S_z, that would be the z-component of the magnetic moment. But it's better to write mu = gamma S, so that mu_z = gamma S_z. But perhaps in the problem, they are defining the magnetude of the moment as gamma times spin. But the direction.

Well, proceeding, the problem says mu = gamma*S_z. That seems a bit strange because if the magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction, then mu is along +Z, so the operator mu would have components (0,0,gamma*S_z). But perhaps in the problem statement, they wrote mu = gamma*S_z as an operator in the direction of the magnetic field, but in this problem, since the initial alignment is with +Z and then the fields are in different directions, maybe mu is a vector operator where each component is gamma times the spin component. Let me clarify. Well, in standard cases, the magnetic moment is a vector, mu_x = gamma S_x, mu_y = gamma S_y, mu_z = gamma S_z. So maybe the (gamma*Sz) in the parentheses is just emphasizing the operator for the z-component.

But regardless, H_initial = -mu · B_initial z-hat = -gamma B S_z. Then H_final is -gamma B S_y. So the rest of the analysis. Then my derivation for Heisenberg equations gives us that <S_z> oscillation frequency is gamma B. But something is missing here.

Wait, but hmm. harmonic oscillator equation gave angular frequency omega = gamma B, so frequency is f = omega/(2π) = gamma B/(2π). But wait, in spin precession, the frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma B. But perhaps in this case, since the Hamiltonian is -gamma B S_y, the energy levels are proportional to S_y, and the time evolution. Also, perhaps the time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ). So putting H = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution operator is exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ). Then acting on the initial state |+z>, which is a spin-up state in z-direction. But S_y has eigenvalues for the y-direction eigenstates. Let's perhaps work that out.

Express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The eigenstates of S_y for spin-1/2 are |+y> = (|+z> + i |−z>)/√2,

and |-y> = (|+z> - i |−z>)/√2. So inverse relations: |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/√2.

Wait: Let me check again. For spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates of S_y are given by |+y> = 1/√2 ( |+z> + i |−z> ), and |-y> = 1/√2 ( |+z> - i |−z> ). Yes, since S_y is defined as (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y, which has eigenvectors (1, i) and (1, -i). Therefore, in z-basis.

Thus, if the initial state is |+z>, which can be written as ( |+y> + |-y> ) / √2.

Then the time evolution under H = -gamma B S_y. So the Schrödinger equation time evolution is given by:

|psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |+z> = exp( i gamma B S_y t / ħ ) |+z>.

But H is proportional to S_y, so acting on |+y> and |-y>.

So express |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>) / sqrt(2), thus:

|psi(t)> = exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

But S_y |+y> = (ħ/2)|+y>,

and S_y |−y> = -(ħ/2)|−y>). Therefore:

exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>,

Similarly,

exp(i gamma B S_y t / ħ) |−y> = exp( -i gamma B (ħ/2) t / ħ ) |−y> ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |−y>.

Therefore, the state becomes:

|psi(t)> = [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2).

Now, let's express this back in the z-basis. Since |+y> = (|+z> + i |−z> )/sqrt(2),

so substituting back:

|psi(t)> = [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) ( |+z> + i |−z> ) / sqrt(2) + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) ( |+z> - i |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify the terms:

= [ (exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )) |+z> + i (exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) - exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )) |−z> ] / 2

Using Euler's formula:

= [ 2 cos(gamma B t / 2 ) |+z> + i ( 2i sin(gamma B t / 2 )) |−z> ] / 2

= [ cos(gamma B t / 2 ) |+z> - sin(gamma B t / 2 ) |−z> ]

Therefore, |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |−z>, where theta = gamma B t / 2.

Then, compute the expectation value <S_z> in this state.

S_z for |+z> is ħ/2, and for |−z> is -ħ/2. Therefore:

< S_z > = |c_+|^2 (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 (-ħ/2) where c_+ = cos(theta), c_- = - sin(theta).

So,

< S_z > = [cos²(theta) - sin²(theta)] (ħ/2 ) = cos(2 theta) (ħ/2 )

But theta is gamma B t / 2. Therefore, 2 theta = gamma B t. Hence,

< S_z > = (ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

Therefore, the average z component of the spin (and hence the magnetic moment, since mu_z = gamma S_z) oscillates as cos(gamma B t ). The frequency is the angular frequency divided by 2 pi. The argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so angular frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is omega/(2pi) = gamma B / (2 pi).

Wait, but in QM literature, Larmor precession is often given with angular frequency gamma B. For example, spin in magnetic field precesses with angular frequency omega = gamma B, so the precession frequency is gamma B. But when you talk about oscilation frequency in terms of the expectation value of S_z, which goes as cos(omega t), then omega here is the angular frequency, so when they are asking "oscillation frequency", they might mean either the angular frequency or the regular frequency. But generally, for such questions in quantum mechanics, especially with spin precession, frequency often refers to the angular frequency when written as omega. But maybe not. Typically, standard frequency f is omega/(2 pi). In the formula I have here, the expectation value oscillates as cos(gamma B t), hence the angular frequency is gamma B (radians per second), and frequency f is gamma B / (2 pi) cycles per second (Hz). But which one is the answer?

Let me check the problem statement again. It says, "What is its oscillation frequency?" So if "frequency" without further clarification, sometimes in physics contexts it's taken as angular frequency when given in terms of angular terms. But sometimes, in problem statements, it's expected as Hz. However, in this particular case, given that the magnetic fields are of the same magnitude B, and spin-1/2, the answer is gamma B / 2π ?

But actually, I should check with the solution I obtained through solving the ODE in Heisenberg picture, [d² <S_z> / dt² + (gamma B)^2 <S_z> = 0], so the oscillation frequency (angular) is omega = gamma B, hence leading to <S_z> ~ cos(omega t), so "oscillation frequency" as omega. But in my calculation using Schrödinger picture, I ended up with <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency is omega = gamma B, so same result.

Hence, in terms of angular frequency, it's gamma B. Oscillation frequency (angular, omega) would be gamma B, and the 'frequency' f = omega / (2pi) would be gamma B / (2pi). The problem just says "oscillation frequency." But in quantum mechanics, when talking about the time dependence of expectation values, angular frequency is more commonly stated when they are using cos(omega t), unless they specify "frequency in Hz" or "cycles per second". An example is in photon energy E = ħ omega, but often just omega is referred to as frequency.

But to confirm, the problem says "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?"

In standard physics, the oscillation frequency refers to "nu", which is cycles per second, measured in Hz. So when we have cos(2 pi nu t), the frequency is nu. So, given that the expression here is cos(gamma B t), then if we want to get nu, we need to have the argument 2 pi nu t = gamma B t. Therefore, gamma B = 2 pi nu => nu = gamma B / (2 pi). Therefore, frequency is gamma B divided by 2 pi.

But wait, in the expression <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), so angular frequency is gamma B. So omgea = gamma B.

But then depending on the convention of the problem, sometimes "frequency" is not clearly defined, and some people might answer omega, other might answer nu = omega / 2 pi.

Given that it's a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic field, and the oscillation in time of the average, this is analogous to spin precession. When a spin is in a magnetic field, it precesses with Larmor frequency which is omega_L = gamma B, and the usual Larmor frequency is in radians per second, but sometimes it's quoted as nu_L = gamma B / (2 pi). So depends on the convention here.

But given that we derived in the calculation <S_z> goes like cos(gamma B t), so if a function f(t) = cos(omega t) has frequency omega. So perhaps here the problem want omega / 2 pi, but need to check.

Wait, here's a possible alternative approach. If you derive the time to get the same value, which is the period T. For the oscillation, the period T is 2pi / omega, so the frequency is 1 / T = omega / 2pi. Therefore, if omega = gamma B, then the frequency is gamma B/(2pi).

But here's another viewpoint. The Hamiltonian after the switch is along Y, so possible to think this induces transitions between Z eigenstates.

But I think what's correct is that the frequency in Hz is gamma B / (2 pi), but given that in terms of angular frequency, which much more natural if you express the time evolution with exponentials, but since in <S_z> we have a cos(gamma B t), which the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi). Honestly, it's a bit ambiguous. However, quantum mechanics textbook problems usually give expectation values in terms of angular frequency when expressing results. For example, if you have a two-state system and you do Rabi oscillations, the Rabi frequency is given as Omega, and when they are taking about oscillation frequency in experiments, they often quote Omega/(2pi), but depends on the textbook.

Alternatively, perhaps this entire business with factors comes into play? Let me check if it needs to account for 2 from somewhere. So if my expression is <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), since S_z has eigenvalues +/- ħ/2, the maximum swing between + ħ/2 and - ħ/2, oscillating as cos(gamma B t). So the peaks would be every pi/(gamma B) time, but the period would be 2pi/(gamma B). Then, the frequency in Hz is gamma B / (2 pi). Thus, as per the problem: which is oscillation frequency. Let me read again the problem...

 ... starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?

So, given that the initial direction is Z, then magnetic field is flipped to Y. So in resonance, precession.

But perhaps a better way is to accept that frequency here is defined as number of cycles per unit time, so based on the argument of cosine.

But in standard periodic motion, the argument for the cosine is omega t, the angular frequency. So for S_z(t), it is cos(omega t), therefore, the angular frequency is omega. So when asked for frequency, if it's angular, answer omega=gamma B. If not, answer f=gamma B/(2 pi).

So since the user asks to "put your final answer within \boxed{}, perhaps I need to see typical answers to such problems.

For example, in the case of a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field, transitioning from being along Z to Y, the oscillation frequency of the spin component is given by the energy splitting in the Hamiltonian. The frequency can sometimes be called the Rabi frequency.

Wait, Rabi frequency occurs when you have a time-dependent oscillating field. If we have a static field along Y.

Wait, no, perhaps the oscillation here is due to the time evolution of the spin in a constant field. The energy eigenstates are along Y, and since we have a state that is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, when we take the expectation value into another axis, we get oscillations. Then the transition frequency is (E_+ - E_-)/h-bar, which is gamma B. Therefore, the angular frequency (so differences in energy / h-bar). Here, the energy levels for H_final: E_+ = -gamma B * (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B * (ħ/2 ). So the difference is E_+ - E_- = - gamma B * ħ, so (E_+ - E_-)/ħ = -gamma B. So the oscillation frequency (angular) is | (E_+ - E_- ) | / ħ = gamma B.

Therefore, yes, in terms of angular frequency, the oscillation is gamma B. But units must match.

Alternatively, [gamma] might have units? Depending on the model. If gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, here, given that mu = gamma S, so the units of gamma would be (magnetic moment)/(spin). S has units of h-bar, as if spin is in units of angular momentum. Magnetic moment has units of, say, J/T. Therefore, gamma has units of (J/T)/(J·s))? Wait, spin has units of J·s (angular momentum). Magnetic moment has units of J/T. Then gamma would be (J/T ) / ( J · s ) ) = 1/(T · s ), which is T^(-1) s^(-1). But Frequency has units of s^(-1) (angular frequency is the same numerically but often radians are considered dimensionless). Wait, we need to check. Let me think.

If the magnetic field is in Tesla, B. gamma (gyromagnetic ratio) units are such that gamma * B gives frequency (angular), 1/seconds. So gamma has units of (rad/s)/T; because angular frequency gamma*B has units rad/s. So the gyromagnetic ratio typically has units of rad/(s·T). So such in that case, gamma * B would be rad/s, that is, the angular frequency, theta_dot, Larmor frequency.

Which connects to the expression <S_z> ~ cos(gamma B t), so the frequency is gamma B in (rad/s). Therefore, if they ask for frequency (f), then it's gamma B / (2 pi) Hz. But if they ask for "oscillation frequency" without more details, since expectations are written in terms of the angular frequency. So, considering the problem statement: it says, "What is its oscillation frequency?" So best to stick with GHz ...

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the given gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, which already accounts for factors like 2 pi or not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the confusion arises whether to account for the spin being 1/2. For instance, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, S_z here in terms of ħ? For a spin-1/2, S_z has eigenvalues +/- ħ/2. Then perhaps gamma is given here in such a way that gamma already incorporates factors, but in the time evolution, the energy levels would be E = H = - mu · B, so for example, for a magnetic field along Y, H = - gamma B S_y /, hence energy levels are -gamma B (ħ/2) and gamma B (ħ/2), values such. Therefore differences +gamma B (ħ). So energy gap is gamma B ħ, so omega = (delta E)/ħ = gamma B, which coincides with the earlier results: <S_z> will oscillate with frequency angularly gamma B.

But this seems so perhaps in the answer, the oscillation frequency (angular specialization, given as) omega=gamma B. Therefore, answer is to state that the frequency is in units of gamma B. If the original gyromagnetic ratio is given as gamma, then yes, gamma B is angular frequency. But in conclusion, the correct answer here is omega=gamma B. So the average z-component oscillates with angular frequency gamma B, so the oscillation frequency,  probably entered simply \boxed{\gamma B}.

But need double check.

Wait, going back to time evolution in the Schrödinger picture. The state is a superposition of the new Hamiltonian eigenstates, leading to beats between them. Since the two eigenstates for S_y are |+y> and |-y>, difference in energy deltaE = gamma B ħ (moving from - to +), so delta E = gamma B ħ. Hence, the time evolution of the phase difference is (delta E / ħ) t, which is gamma B t. Which would lead to oscillation frequency gamma B, as the difference of (E_+ - E_-)/ ħ. However, when you compose a state composed of two energy eigenstates, the frequency of the beat in the expectation value is (E_+ - E_-)/h, without involving 2π here.

Wait, no: The probability amplitude that sthe state remains in |+y> instead alternative between states. But the beat frequency would be determined by the frequency difference ... wait, more precisely, in the superposition of two states with energies E_+ and E_-, the time evolution is such that each term comes with a phase factor exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) and exp(-i E_- t / ħ). So the relative phase between the two is delta E t / ħ. Hence, the beating frequency is delta E / h. Because when delta E t / ħ changes by 2 pi, you get a full cycle. Thus, the frequency is (delta E)/ ( h ), since h = 2 pi ħ.

Hence here, delta E = ħ gamma B.

So, frequency would be delta E / h = ħ gamma B / h = gamma B/( 2 pi). Hence, cycles per second as gamma B over 2 pi. So if they ask for frequency (i.e., cycles per second) then f = gamma B / (2 pi).

But if your calculation of the expectation value as cos(gamma B t ), then looking at per length of time for the cosine to complete a cycle, which is when gamma B t = 2 pi, so t = 2 pi / ( gamma B ). Hence frequency of cycles is 1/(2 pi / (gamma B )) ) = gamma B/( 2 pi )

Therefore, the answer is gamma B / (2 pi )

But wait, contradicts...

Wait, the expactation value part. In the expression <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ), the argument of cosine is in radians. So the time for <S_z> to return to its original value is when gamma B t = 2 pi. Therefore T = 2 pi / (gamma B ), which makes frequency f = gamma B / ( 2 pi ). But some sources might call it angular frequency omega=gamma B. Hence which is desired?

Have to recall the structure of the equation in S_z.

In the ODE analysis, we found:

d² <S_z> /dt² + (gamma B )^2 <S_z> =0.

Which is similar to a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency gamma B, leading to period 2 pi / ( gamma B ). Therefore if we are to call the "oscillation frequency", within the wave solution cos( gamma B t ), requiring the frequency nu such that gamma B t = 2 pi nu t, so 2 pi nu t = gamma B t ⇒ nu=gamma B / (2 pi )

So it's concluded.

Thus gamma B is the angular frequency, and oscillation frequency is f=gamma B/(2 pi )

Yet the problem has "the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?"

In physics, the term "frequency" unless specified often refers to ordinary frequency (Hz). But some teachers might conflate angular frequency with "frequency". But quarter check.

Alternatively, looking back to when we transformed the state from |+z> to the time evolution. The expectation value, <S_z> (t) : (hbar/2) cos(gamma B t )

If you write cos(omega t ), so the period is 2pi/omega. This corresponds to a maximum displacement every T=2pi/omega. Thus, frequency-to be 1/T=omega/(2 pi )

Therefore, since the expression is cos(gamma B t ). So T=2pi/(gamma B ). Hence frequency is gamma B/(2 pi )

Thus, thus above derivation point north as Higer frequency, and the answer should be \boxed{\dfrac{\gamma B}{2\pi}}.

But I had another part of my brain recalling as identity with angular frequency. So to make sure, but need to think.

Alternatively, maybe not need to. Let me look at authoritative sources.

Griffiths’ Quantum Mechanics textbook, chap. 4, example (magnetic resonance). In the example, Larmor frequency is set by the magnetic field: omega_0 = gamma B_0. When an oscillating field is applied, you get resonance when the frequency matches the Larmor frequency (there about page 193). Maybe in Cohen-Tannoudji, this is more clear. Or Shankar. Let me in mind.

In sakurai chapter 1 or 2, there is an example of spin precession. Let me mull it over.

In spin precession, if a spin is in B-field along, say, z, then the state will precess around z-axis at Larmor frequency omega = gamma B.

 Therefore, applying magnetic field in y-axis may induce precession about the y-axis, yes?

But the problem here is the spin initially aligned along +z, then the field is turned off and field along y.

Therefore, the spin is no longer in an eigenstate of the Hamilotnian. Then the state evolve processing around the y-axis. Hence the expectation valueof Sz provides an oscillating. The frequency of this isfrom the hamiltonian Ho = -gamma B S y. The Energy difference in the eigenstates of this Hamiltionian ( which are Sy eigenstates ) must. So difference in energy is -gamma B (ħ /2 ) - gamma B ( -ħ /2 ) = gamma B ħ, so Uh, wait, actually, H+ for the energy eigenstate | y+>> is H |y+> = -gamma B S y | y+> = = -gamma B (+ hbar /2) | y+>... unless if the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B.

 Wait, wait, the magnetic interaction energy is indeed H = - mu · B. Here, after switching, the B is along Y, so H = - gamma B * S_y. So the eigenstate |y+> corresponds to E_+ = - gamma B * ( ħ / 2 ). Similarly, E_- -> -gamma B (- ħ / 2 ) = + gamma B ( ħ /2 ). So their energy difference is ( gamma B h/2 - (- gamma B hbar /2 )) or ( E_- - E_+ )= gamma B hbar

 Thus, energy difference is gamma B hbar. Therefore, (E_- - E_+)/hbar = gamma B. Thus, the phase difference between the eigenstates in time evolution is pho E delta t / hbar. So when you write the two state with time phases exp(-i E_+ t/hbar ) and exp(-i E_- t / hbar )

their dueference in phase is however ( Ei-E_+) t/ hbar= gamma B t. Hence when considering this phase factor to the probability amplitudes and to the expectation value, such as, as seen in the calculation of < S_z >, leading to cos( gamma B t). So this suggest that after time t=2pi/(gamma B ), the angle is back= gamma B *2 pi= argument wraps GMing%2C hence experience coding ocs.nah。\

Thus，is this differing frequencies. The hack (讨论这么多，或许正确)。Overall the conclusion is that <S_z> oscilates as co世(gamma Bt)， therefore ω= gammaB, so oscillation frequency is gammaB/(2 pi)。the final box should probably be gamma B over 2 pi.”

Wait，不过原问题中的时间演化里Hamiltonian是对易的吗？ No，原问题中的磁场关闭后启动另一个在Y方向磁场。所以量子态在时间演化中按照H = -gamma B S_y。所以初始态分解为H的本征态并随时间演化产生相因子差。正如之前的推导。正如此，“因此，expectation value of S_z will oscillates with angular frequency gamma B。”

在这点，学校里因此我认为如果使用角频率的话答案应当是gamma B，但是因为问题中没有说明是否带不带因子2pi，可能取决于题目的习惯。但是根据最初的分析与<S_z> = (ħ / 2) cos(gamma B t)，角的频率是gamma B，对应的每个时间周期为2pi/gamma B，所以频率为gamma B。例如在Jaynes-cummings模型里类似的振荡通常使用角频率。

但是也有可能，考虑到哈密顿量H/(ħ)的量纲的单位是1/s，那么H的能级E/ℏ对应频率的量纲。在我们的案例中，能级的差是delta E = gamma B ħ，所以对应的频率为gamma B ħ / ħ = gamma B，所以角频率是gamma B。

然而，观察到频率的一个完整周期应该对应于函数cos(gamma B t)的完整周期，所以相对于t的完整周期T，2pi/gamma B，所以频率nu=1/T=gamma B / (2pi)。依此答案应该是gamma B/(2pi)。

可能的情况是，这题由于初始处于叠加态时间演化产生的振荡频率对应于能级差除以ℎ，因此frequency in Hz ( nu = delta E / h )

而能级差在这里是 E_+ - E_- = -gamma B (hbar/2 ) - gamma B (-hbar/2 ) = -gamma B hbar/2 + gamma B h bar/2= gamma B hbar。因此 delta E = gamma B hbar, 要计算的是转换到约好像期望值的振荡频率，也就是每个周期这个相位变化的次数。公式如下，

Because the state is a superposition of the two eigenstates of the final Hamiltonian，exposition comes that how the system evolves over time。而☞ Sy本征态对应的相位差：

Each term has its own phase factor:

exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) 和exp(-i E_- t / ħ ), difference in phase:

ΔΦ= ( E_- - E_+ ) t / ħ = gamma B hbar t / ħ=gamma B t

此位相差会在回到原状时需要gamma B t = 2pi，即t=2pi/gamma B\

因此对应的托interpretation 振荡周期的频率nu=1/(2pi/gamma B) )=gamma B/(2pi )

Op如此正确回答应当是gamma B divided by 2\pi，即 γB/(2π )

因此回复\boxed{\dfrac{\gamma B}{2\pi} }

但是我之前陀螺运动中使用经典的公式的话，对应的导率ω=γB，这个ω是角速度。而因此在这里可能两种答案都正确，取决于是要用Hz还是用rad/s。但原题所述是突然关闭然后打开磁场，导致磁矩开始振荡。可能应该是经典处理方式中的拉莫频率，但是我需要確認他的gamma通常的组合。

但更仔细的问题是，题目给定的磁矩算符是否能解决这个问题：题目说明”mu (=gamma* Sz )”，这可能对原基度的汉馬顿的 SIG…

尝试忽略问题中的其他可能性，原直产品的解决可能即为gammaB 或者 γB/ (2π )。根据上面的分析，
有两个可能。

回到原 unit análisis 的问题：

如果gamma是MHz/T时布局冲的话，gamma B时就会变成一个频率的说法。例如Franko红球的 gyromagnetic ratio of electron is gamma_e = e/(2m_e),放射但它的的是户正确考虑单位的话。详情可知。
但此处可能忽视具体的单位和 coefficients，而只需要通过the derived cosine的时间参敤确定频率。因此其正确的答案是框里的gamma B如变种？

可能我给能明确证明闭环时期怎麽标：

 <S_z> = (hbar/2) cos( gamma B t )

这就是以gamma B为角频率的振荡，因此通常提到的频率即为gamma B，但现在需要決定問題的是要的角频率還是普通頻率。 考虑问题提到“平均值开始振荡.的…频率”，呈通常的问题若无指定单位角频率（如中的数值频率），在这里可能期 Angarer YES 角频率 gamma B。

但随着他在线偏向，可能需要全本清源：

The customary utilization inquantum mechanics for oscillation frequency in expectation values is the angular frequency. For instance, in NMR terminology, Larmor frequency is given as angular frequency gamma B，so应当回答gamma B。但在< S_z >中的 Arg使用讨论下进行了因此，这里可能 correct answer 是gamma B, 从而对应的 Angular frequency. The proble的问题的原文何？

问题说：“平均值的 z 分量开始振荡。他的振荡频率是多少？” 有可能被称为这个的频度为甘忏悔 2pi敕。否则看好是Angular频率。在考试问题中最常见答案是伽玛商所以在此处我必须 unt趙这个点。

最后一次check那段比較，当得时间演化后的可观测量的时间演变式中的参数： cosine(gamma B t),所以他的振荡的频率断是否平均姣值作为一个函数的时间。If I have <S_z> = constant * cos(gamma B t), then gamma B被定义为角频率，所以用弧度每秒。如Asked in what's the frequency of th [ [oscillation.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I have this problem here about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is originally aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Then the magnetic field is turned off and another one in the +Y direction is turned on, both with magnitude B. The question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the switch. I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, I remember that the magnetic moment is related to the spin operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment operator is given by mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S is the spin operator. In this case, since the initial magnetic field is along the Z-axis, the initial Hamiltonian would be H_initial = -mu · B = -gamma * B S_z, right?

Wait, actually, magnetic energy is usually given by the dot product of magnetic moment and the magnetic field, so H = -mu · B. So if the initial magnetic field is along +Z, then H_initial = -gamma * B S_z. Then the particle is initially in the ground state aligned with the magnetic field. Since it's spin-1/2, the eigenstates of S_z are |up> and |down> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So if the magnetic moment is aligned with +Z, then the initial state is |up> with S_z = ħ/2. So that's the initial state.

Now, when the magnetic field is suddenly switched off and a new one in the +Y direction is turned on. So the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma * B S_y.

Wait, same magnitude B? The problem states that both fields have the same magnitude, B. So we turn off the Z-field and turn on Y-field of same B. Now the question is about the time evolution of the average z-component of the particle's moment, <S_z>, after the switch. They mention that this average starts oscillating, and we need to find the oscillation frequency.

So first, this is a standard time evolution problem. The state is initially in the |up> state along Z. Then at t=0, the Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma B S_y. The state will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation under this new Hamiltonian.

So the initial state |psi(0)> = |+z> = |up> in the z-direction. Let's write this in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian, which is in the y-direction. Because when the Hamiltonian changes, the new time evolution will depend on the eigenstates of the final Hamiltonian.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. If I can express the initial state |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>, then since these are eigenstates of H_final, their time evolution will just acquire phases. Then when you compute <S_z>, it might lead to oscillations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the Heisenberg picture, where we find the time evolution of the S_z operator under the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y.

Hmm. Let me think. So if we use the Heisenberg equation of motion, dS_z/dt = (1/iħ) [S_z, H]. Let's compute that.

But first, let's note the Hamiltonian after the switch: H = -gamma B S_y. The gyromagnetic ratio gamma relates the magnetic moment to the spin: mu = gamma S. Then, H = - mu · B = - gamma B S_y.

So now, the time evolution is governed by H = - gamma B S_y.

So in the Heisenberg picture, the operator S_z(t) = exp(i H t / ħ) S_z exp(-i H t / ħ).

To compute the time derivative, according to Heisenberg's equation: dS_z/dt = (1/iħ) [S_z, H]. Let me compute that commutator.

First, let's compute [S_z, H] = [S_z, - gamma B S_y] = - gamma B [S_z, S_y] = - gamma B (i ħ S_x), by the commutation relations of angular momentum operators. Recall that [S_i, S_j] = i ħ ε_ijk S_k, where ε_ijk is the Levi-Civita symbol.

So [S_z, S_y] = i ħ S_x. Wait, actually, verify: [S_x, S_y] = iħ S_z, so cyclic permutations. Let me be precise. Let's denote [S_i, S_j] = iħ ε_ijk S_k.

So [S_z, S_y] = iħ ε_zyx S_x = iħ * (-1) ε_zxy S_x = -iħ S_x.

Wait, epsilon_z_y_x. How's the Levi-Civita defined? The indices are z, y, x. The permutation from (x,y,z) to (z,y,x). Let me recall that epsilon_ijk is +1 for even permutations of (1,2,3), -1 for odd.

But here, the indexes are in the order z, y, x. Let's assign x=1, y=2, z=3. So the permutation is from (1,2,3) to (3,2,1). So positions 1 and 3 are swapped. That's an odd permutation. So epsilon_zyx = epsilon_3 2 1. So epsilon_312 would be equivalent? Wait, original ordering is (z,y,x) in term of 3,2,1.

Yes, so epsilon_321 = -1, since swapping 1 and 3 is one transposition, so two transpositions: 1<->2, 2<->3? Wait, no. Wait, the parity of the permutation is determined by the number of transpositions needed to sort the indices. For indices (3,2,1), to sort back to (1,2,3) can be done by first swapping 1 and 3: (1,2,3) → swapping 1 and 3 gives (3,2,1). Since it's an odd number of transpositions (1), the Levi-Civita symbol is -1.

Therefore, [S_z, S_y] = iħ epsilon_zyx S_x = iħ (-1) S_x = -iħ S_x. Therefore, [S_z, H] = -gamma B [S_z, S_y] = -gamma B (-iħ S_x) = i gamma B ħ S_x.

Putting this back into Heisenberg's equation: dS_z/dt = (1/iħ)(i gamma B ħ S_x) )= gamma B S_x.

Similarly, the time derivative of S_z is gamma B S_x.

But we need to compute dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x. Now, but we can also compute the time derivative of S_x. Let's do that: dS_x/dt = (1/iħ)[S_x, H] = (1/iħ)[S_x, -gamma B S_y] = (-gamma B / iħ) [S_x, S_y] = (-gamma B / iħ)(iħ S_z) = -gamma B S_z.

Similarly, dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z.

So now we have a system of differential equations:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x.

dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z.

These are the Heisenberg equations. Let me note that these equations are similar to classical rotations. Let me write them:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x,

dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z.

This is a set of coupled differential equations. Let me take the second derivative of S_z:

d²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (-gamma B S_z) = - (gamma B)^2 S_z.

Therefore, the equation governing S_z is:

d²S_z/dt² + (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0.

This is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency (gamma B).

Thus, the solution is:

S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).

Whereas, because this is an operator equation, but when considering the expectation value, since the time evolution for the operators in Heisenberg picture, and the expectation values must satisfy the same equations.

Therefore, the expectation value <S_z(t)> in the Heisenberg picture would satisfy the same differential equation:

d²<S_z>/dt² + (gamma B)^2 <S_z> = 0.

Thus, the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but in this case, but gamma is actually the gyromagnetic ratio. For a spin-1/2 particle, the gyromagnetic ratio gamma is related to the spin g-factor. The actual magnetic moment mu is given by mu = gamma S, and the Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B.

But for a spin-1/2 particle like an electron, the gyromagnetic ratio gamma is for the electron. But perhaps we have here just a spin-1/2 with given gamma. However, since the problem says "gamma*Sz" in the initial description: "mu (= gamma*Sz)", so here, the magnetic moment operator is given as mu = gamma S_z, but maybe actually it's gamma S, since the magnetic moment is a vector. Let me check the original problem statement.

The problem states: "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction." Wait, this seems wrong. Wait, magnetic moment is a vector. If it's gamma*S_z, that would be the z-component of the magnetic moment. But it's better to write mu = gamma S, so that mu_z = gamma S_z. But perhaps in the problem, they are defining the magnetude of the moment as gamma times spin. But the direction.

Well, proceeding, the problem says mu = gamma*S_z. That seems a bit strange because if the magnetic moment is aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction, then mu is along +Z, so the operator mu would have components (0,0,gamma*S_z). But perhaps in the problem statement, they wrote mu = gamma*S_z as an operato

I'm working on a quantum physics problem concerning a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu. Initially, the particle is aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. The scenario changes when this magnetic field is turned off and replaced with one of equal magnitude B in the +Y direction. I need to determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment after this switch.

I'll start by recalling that the magnetic moment is related to the spin operator through mu = gamma * S, where gamma represents the gyromagnetic ratio. With the initial magnetic field along the Z-axis, the initial Hamiltonian would be H_initial = -mu · B = -gamma * B S_z. 

The magnetic energy is expressed by the dot product of magnetic moment and magnetic field, confirming that H = -mu · B. Since the particle is initially aligned with the +Z magnetic field, it must be in the ground state. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of S_z are |up⟩ and |down⟩ with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively. With the magnetic moment aligned along +Z, the initial state is |up⟩ with S_z = ħ/2.

When the field switches to the +Y direction with the same magnitude B, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma * B S_y. The problem asks about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment, ⟨S_z⟩, following this switch.

This is a time evolution problem. The initial state |psi(0)⟩ = |+z⟩ = |up⟩ in the z-direction needs to be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

I could approach this using the Heisenberg picture, where we determine the time evolution of the S_z operator under the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y.

Using the Heisenberg equation of motion: dS_z/dt = (1/iħ) [S_z, H], I'll calculate this commutator.

First, [S_z, H] = [S_z, -gamma B S_y] = -gamma B [S_z, S_y]. Using the commutation relations of angular momentum operators [S_i, S_j] = iħ ε_ijk S_k, where ε_ijk is the Levi-Civita symbol, I find [S_z, S_y] = -iħ S_x.

Therefore, [S_z, H] = -gamma B (-iħ S_x) = iħ gamma B S_x.

Substituting into Heisenberg's equation: dS_z/dt = (1/iħ)(iħ gamma B S_x) = gamma B S_x.

Similarly, I can compute dS_x/dt = (1/iħ)[S_x, H] = (1/iħ)[S_x, -gamma B S_y] = (-gamma B/iħ)(iħ S_z) = -gamma B S_z.

Now I have a system of differential equations:
dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x
dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z

Taking the second derivative of S_z:
d²S_z/dt² = gamma B dS_x/dt = gamma B (-gamma B S_z) = -(gamma B)² S_z

This yields the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency (gamma B):
d²S_z/dt² + (gamma B)² S_z = 0

The solution is: S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t)

Since this is an operator equation, the expectation value ⟨S_z(t)⟩ in the Heisenberg picture satisfies the same differential equation. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment is gamma B.

I have an issue with a spin-1/2 particle that possesses a magnetic moment, denoted as mu, initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Subsequently, this magnetic field is switched off, while another field with the same magnitude B is activated along the +Y direction. The inquiry seeks the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment following the change in fields. I need to determine how to solve this.

Initially, I am aware that the magnetic moment is related to the spin operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, it is expressed as mu = gamma * S, where gamma signifies the gyromagnetic ratio, and S represents the spin operator. Considering the magnetic field is initially along the Z-axis, the initial Hamiltonian would be H_initial = -mu · B, giving us -gamma * B S_z.

Magnetic energy is described by the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field, so H = -mu · B. When the magnetic field is along +Z, H_initial = -gamma * B S_z. The particle begins in the ground state aligned with this magnetic field. For spin-1/2, the eigenstates of S_z are |up> and |down> with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Thus, if aligned with +Z, the initial state is |up> with S_z = ħ/2.

When the magnetic field in the +Z direction is switched off, and a new field is introduced in the +Y direction with the same magnitude B, the new Hamiltonian is given by H_final = -gamma * B S_y. The problem indicates both fields have the same strength, hence switching them triggers the oscillations of the average z-component, <S_z>. We need to determine the oscillation frequency.

This is recognized as a time evolution problem. The particle initially occupies the |up> state along the Z direction. At t=0, the Hamiltonian alters to H = -gamma B S_y, necessitating the state to evolve per the time-dependent Schrödinger equation under this new configuration.

The initial state |psi(0)> = |+z> = |up> related to the z-direction needs to be expressed in terms of the final Hamiltonian's y-direction eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, with respective eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. As eigenstates of H_final, their time evolution will involve acquiring phases, which will reveal oscillations when computing the average <S_z>.

Alternatively, the Heisenberg picture can be utilized to find the time evolution of S_z based on H = -gamma B S_y. Applying Heisenberg's equation of motion, dS_z/dt = (1/iħ) [S_z, H], facilitates this examination.

First, observe the Hamiltonian post-switch: H = -gamma B S_y, with gamma linking the magnetic moment to the spin: mu = gamma S, hence H = - mu · B = - gamma B S_y. Within the Heisenberg picture, the S_z operator evolves as S_z(t) = exp(i H t / ħ) S_z exp(-i H t / ħ).

For the commutator [S_z, H] = [S_z, - gamma B S_y] = - gamma B [S_z, S_y] = - gamma B (i ħ S_x), we draw on angular momentum operator commutation properties: [S_i, S_j] = i ħ ε_ijk S_k, where ε_ijk represents the Levi-Civita symbol.

Upon calculation: [S_z, S_y] = i ħ S_x, using commutation relations and in particular [S_i, S_j] = i ħ ε_ijk S_k, results in [S_z, S_y] = -iħ S_x. Consequently, [S_z, H] = i gamma B ħ S_x.

Integrating this into Heisenberg's equation gives dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x, leading to corresponding dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z, providing a system of differential equations:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x,
dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z.

These correlate with classical rotations, written as:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x,
dS_x/dt = -gamma B S_z.

Upon taking the second derivative of S_z:

d²S_z/dt² = - (gamma B)^2 S_z,

reveals the simple harmonic oscillator equation with angular frequency (gamma B):

d²S_z/dt² + (gamma B)^2 S_z = 0.

The resultant solution is:

S_z(t) = A cos(gamma B t) + B sin(gamma B t).

In the operator context, expectation values in the Heisenberg picture satisfy the same equation:

d²<S_z>/dt² + (gamma B)^2 <S_z> = 0,

confirming the oscillation frequency as gamma B.

Considering the gyromagnetic ratio gamma, it relates to the spin g-factor for a spin-1/2 particle. For spin-1/2 particles like electrons, gamma is characteristic, and aligning with the problem's assertion of "gamma*S," we concluded that the magnetic moment is specified this way. Hence, reasoning consistent with the problem statement yields that the magnetic moment, being a vector, aligns along +Z, indicating components (0,0,gamma*S_z). Nonetheless, the problem implies mu = gamma*S_z, seemingly reducing to the vectorial component along +Z.

Therefore, similar derivation for the time evolution.\n\nSo from the Heisenberg equation, we obtained that the expectation value <S_z(t)> satisfies the equation of harmonic oscillator with angular frequency gamma B. Hence, the oscillation frequency f is (gamma B)/(2 pi). Wait, wait, the problem says "oscillation frequency", which is nu = omega/(2 pi). But perhaps here, since we are talking about angular frequency vs regular frequency.\n\nBut in physics, sometimes people just refer to angular frequency as frequency when there is context. Let\'s remember that the solution to differential equation is cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency omega is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B / (2 pi). But, the question is, how is gamma defined here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s an easier approach using the energy difference between eigenstates. Because when the Hamiltonian is along Y-direction, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ and E_-.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues for H_final = -gamma B S_y. Since S_y has eigenvalues +/- ħ/2, the energy eigenvalues would be E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = -gamma B (-ħ/2) ) = +gamma B (ħ/2). Therefore, the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. Therefore, the frequency of oscillation is (E_- - E_+)/ħ = gamma B. Thus, the angular frequency is gamma B. So omega = gamma B. Therefore, regular frequency nu = gamma B / (2 pi). But I think the problem just mentions "oscillation frequency", which can be omega. So in this case, the answer is gamma*B.\n\nBut to check, let\'s go through using the Schrödinger picture. The initial state is |+z>. Let\'s express this in terms of |+y> and |-y>. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> + i |−z>), |-y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> − i |−z>). Then, the state |+z> can be written as:\n\n |+z> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+y> + |-y> )\n\nTherefore, at time t=0, the state is |psi(0)> = |+z> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+y> + |-y> )\n\nUnder the Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, each energy eigenstate evolves in time as |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |psi(0)> = 1/sqrt(2) [exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |-y> ]\n\nGiven that E_+ = - gamma B ħ / 2, and E_- = gamma B ħ / 2. So, substituting:\n\n |psi(t)> = 1/sqrt(2) [ exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y> + exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-y> ]\n\nThen, to compute the expectation value <S_z>:\n\nWe know that S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>:\n\n |+y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> + i |-z> )\n\nTherefore, S_z acting on |+y> is S_z |+y> = 1/sqrt(2) (S_z |+z> + i S_z |-z> ) ) = 1/sqrt(2) ( (ħ/2) |+z> + i (-ħ/2) |-z> ) = 1/sqrt(2) ( ħ/2 |+z> - i ħ/2 |-z> ) = ħ/2 * 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> - i |-z> ) ) = ħ/2 |-y>.\n\nWait, wait: 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> - i |-z> ) is |-y>, since |+-y> = 1/sqrt(2) ( |+z> ∓ i |-z> )\n\nWait, standard definitions:\n\n |+y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> + i |-z> )\n\n |-y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> - i |-z> )\n\nHence, S_z |+y> = (1/sqrt(2)) [S_z |+z> + i S_z |-z>] = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (ħ/2)|+z> + i (-ħ/2)|-z> ].\n\nThis simplifies to (1/sqrt(2)) [ (ħ/2)|+z> - i (ħ/2)|-z> ] = (ħ/2)(1/sqrt(2)) [ |+z> - i |-z> ] ) = (ħ/2) |-y>\n\nSimilarly, S_z |-y> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ S_z |+z> - i S_z |-z> ] = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (ħ/2)|+z> - i (-ħ/2)|-z> ] = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (ħ/2)|+z> + i (ħ/2)|-z> ] = (ħ/2)(1/sqrt(2)) [ |+z> + i |-z> ] ) = (ħ/2) |+ y>\n\nTherefore, the matrix representation of S_z in the Y basis is:\n\n <+y| S_z |+y> = (ħ/2)<+y| -y> ) = 0\n\n <+y| S_z |− y> = ħ/2 <+y|+ y> = ħ/2\n\n <− y| S_z |+ y> = ħ/2 <− y| - y> ) = 0\n\n <− y| S_z |− y> = (ħ/2)<− y|+ y> ) = 0\n\nWait, hold on. If S_z |+y> = ħ/2 |-y>,\n\nthen <+y| S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) <+y | -y> = 0,\n\n<−y | S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) <−y | -y> = ħ/2,\n\nSimilarly, the matrix S_z in Y basis has non-zero entries off-diagonal.\n\nTherefore, in the Y basis, S_z is:\n\nS_z = [[ 0, ħ/2 ],\n        [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nS_z |+y> = ħ2( / 2) |- y>, as we had above. So in the Y basis, the S_z matrix has elements:\n\n< +y | S_z | +y > = (ħ/2 ) < +y | − y > = 0,\n\n< +y | S_z | − y > = (ħ/2 ) < +y | +y > = ħ/2,\n\n< − y | S_z | +y > = (ħ/2 ) < − y | − y > = ħ/2,\n\n< − y | S_z | − y > = (ħ/2 ) < − y | − y > = 0? Wait, no. Wait, correction.\n\nWait, if S_z |+ y> = (ħ/2 ) | -y >, then <+y|S_z|+y> is (ħ/2) <+y | -y> = 0. But < -y | S_z | + y > = (ħ/2) < -y | -y > = ħ/2. Conversely, S_z | -y > = (ħ/2)| + y > , so < - y | S_z | - y > = (ħ/2) < - y | + y > = 0. Thus, S_z in the Y basis:\n\nRows and columns as +y, -y:\n\nS_z = [\n[ 0,     ħ/2 ],\n[ ħ/2,  0 ]\n]\n\nTherefore, when we write |psi(t)> expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y> as:\n\n |psi(t)> = 1/sqrt(2) [ e^{i gamma B t / 2 } |+y> + e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } |- y > ]\n\nAnd compute <S_z> in that state:\n\n <S_z> = < psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) > = Let\'s expand this:\n\nIt\'s 1/sqrt(2) [ e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } <+y| + e^{i gamma B t / 2 } <-y| ] * S_z * 1/sqrt(2) [ e^{i gamma B t / 2 } |+y> + e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } |- y > ]\n\nWhen you multiply out the terms, due to S_z elements, only cross terms will contribute.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nTerm1: 1/2 e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } e^{i gamma B t / 2 } <+y| S_z |+y> = 1/2 <+y| S_z |+y> = 0\n\nTerm2: 1/2 e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } <+y| S_z |-y> = 1/2 e^{-i gamma B t } <+y| S_z |-y> = 1/2 e^{-i gamma B t } (ħ/2) δ_{+y, +y} ?? Wait, no. Wait, when you have <+y| S_z |-y>\n\nFrom the matrix above, S_z |-y> is (ħ/2)|+y>, so <+y| S_z |- y> = (ħ/2) <+y| + y> = (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2.\n\nSimilarly, Term2: 1/2 e^{-i gamma B t } * (ħ/2)\n\nTerm3: 1/2 e^{i gamma B t / 2 } e^{i gamma B t / 2 } <-y| S_z |+y> = 1/2 e^{i gamma B t } <-y | S_z | + y> = (ħ/2) * (1/2) e^{i gamma B t }\n\nTerm4: 1/2 e^{i gamma B t / 2 } e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } <-y| S_z |-y> = 1/2 <-y| S_z |-y> = 0 \n\nSo combining Term2 and Term3:\n\n< Sz > = (1/2)(e^{-i gamma B t } * ħ/2 + e^{i gamma B t } * ħ / 2 )\n\nFactor out (ħ/4)[ e^{i gamma B t } + e^{-i gamma B t } ]= (ħ/4) * 2 cos(gamma B t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t)\n\nTherefore, <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t) with angular frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi), but in physics, like in Rabi oscillations, we often refer to the angular frequency, omega, as the oscillation frequency, so the answer here is the angular frequency gamma * B.\n\nBut let me check.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the period is 2 pi / omega, so the frequency is omega / (2 pi). So here, if angular frequency is gamma*B, then the oscillation frequency (number of cycles per second) is gamma*B/(2 pi). However, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency, so technically, if we stick to the problem\'s phrasing, if they refer to the angular frequency, just write omega which is gamma*B. But in units where people are using, especially in spin precession, Lamor frequency is omega_L = gamma B, and when they refer to frequency, they mean omega_L. So in this problem, just gamma B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Gyromagnetic ratio gamma is given. But the problem, however, in the situation specifies "mu (= gamma*S_z)", which is maybe angular. But for a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment might be mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nBut in the question:"magneti c moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction." So if mu = gamma * S_z, then each component would be something else.\n\nWait, actually, if they define mu as equal to gamma multiplied by Sz, then in this case, vectors aren\'t in play. Wait, but that seems odd because the magnetic moment is a vector quantity. So that would mean that when written as above, than mu_x and mu_y would just be zero, but when the magnetic field is turned on along Y, then how does the Hamiltonian change? Maybe the problem has a typo, such that mu is given as gamma*S, but with the note that when aligned along Z, so it was in the eigenstate. But maybe not. Alternatively, the particle was prepared with its magnetic moment (i.e., its average magnetic moment) along +Z (i.e., eigenstate of S_z).\n\nBut regardless, the final answer seems to be that the oscillation frequency is gamma*B.\n\nBut let\'s check solution thoroughly.\n\nAnother approach. The spin precess around the direction of the magnetic field. When the magnetic field is turned on along Y direction, the spin, which was initially along Z, starts precessing around Y. The precession frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma*B.\n\nTherefore, when the spin precesses around Y-axis, the Z-component of the spin does indeed oscillate with frequency gamma*B. So the answer is gamma*B. So either way, whether you use Heisenberg\'s equation, or use the time evolution, or think of precession, you arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is gamma*B, which is angular frequency. So the answer is omega = gamma B.\n\nBut to make sure, let\'s check the units. Let\'s confirm if gamma has appropriate units.\n\nGamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, which is defined as the ratio between the magnetic moment and the angular momentum. For example, in case of the electron, gamma_e = -e/(2 m_e) (the charge times gyromagnetic ratio). The unit of the gyromagnetic ratio is (C kg^{-1}) because magnetic moment has units of A m^2 (Ampere meter squared), and angular momentum has units of kg m^2 s^{-1}, so gamma = mu / S => (A m^2) / ( kg m^2 s^{-1} )) = A s kg^{-1} ), but Amp is Coulombs per second, so gamma has units of (C/s * s)/kg = C/kg. Alternatively, Tesla^{-1} s^{-1}, since when multiplying by B (Tesla), gamma*B would have units of s^{-1}.\n\nWait, gyromagnetic ratio\'s unit when multiplied by B (tesla), gives 1/seconds. For example, nuclear magneton is mu_N = eħ/(2 m_p), so gamma for a nucleus would be (mu_N)/(ħ/2), which is (eħ/(2 m_p )) / (ħ /2 ) = e/m_p, which has units of C/kg. Then gamma, when multiplied by B (Tesla, which is kg/(C s )), so gamma B would have units (C/kg)*(kg/(C s)) ) = 1/s, which is correct—angular frequency. So with that, gamma B indeed has units of angular frequency. So the answer is gamma B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is gamma*B.\n\nBut wait, considering that gamma is originally defined as the proportionality constant between the magnetic moment and Sz, so perhaps the given gamma here is equivalent to the "gyromagnetic ratio" that intrinsically includes the necessary factors. Alternatively, given that if mu = gamma S_z, rather than the vector form mu = gamma S, then... Hmm. Wait, but mu is a vector, aligned with the spin. So for example, if the spin is aligned in an arbitrary direction, the magnetic moment should follow. Therefore, the correct general formula would be mu = gamma S. Then in the initial setting, the magnetic moment\'s operator is vector gamma S. Then Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. Therefore, for initial B along Z: H_initial = - gamma B S_z, then after, along Y: H_final= -gamma B S_y. So the same reasoning applies. Therefore, the conclusion stands, omega = gamma*B.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be gamma B.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe oscillation frequency is \\boxed{\\gamma B}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743814455, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4313, prompt_tokens=2313, total_tokens=6626, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment \(\mu = \gamma S_z\) initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the magnetic field is switched to +Y direction, we need to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The initial Hamiltonian is \(H_{\text{initial}} = -\gamma B S_z\).
   - The particle is initially in the eigenstate \(|+z\rangle\) with \(S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2}\).

2. **Final Hamiltonian**:
   - After switching the magnetic field to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes \(H_{\text{final}} = -\gamma B S_y\).

3. **Time Evolution**:
   - The state evolves under the new Hamiltonian. The eigenstates of \(S_y\) are \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\).
   - The initial state \(|+z\rangle\) is expressed in terms of \(|+y\rangle\) and \(|-y\rangle\):
     \[
     |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle)
     \]
   - The time-evolved state is:
     \[
     |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar}|+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar}|-y\rangle \right)
     \]
   - The energy eigenvalues are \(E_+ = -\gamma B \frac{\hbar}{2}\) and \(E_- = \gamma B \frac{\hbar}{2}\).

4. **Expectation Value of \(S_z\)**:
   - Using the matrix representation of \(S_z\) in the Y basis, the expectation value \(\langle S_z \rangle\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \langle S_z(t) \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
     \]
   - The angular frequency of the oscillation is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates, which is \(\gamma B\).

The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is \(\boxed{\gamma B}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

, so that when it's aligned, the expectation is mu_z = gamma*<S_z>. Not entirely sure, but maybe the problem is simplifying the notation. Let's proceed.

But in any case, the Hamiltonian when the magnetic field is in the Z direction is H = -mu·B, and since B is along Z, the H would be H_initial = -mu_z B = - gamma B S_z, same as above. That part is probably okay.

After switching off the Z-field and turning on the Y-field, the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -mu · B = - gamma B S_y. Therefore, similar derivation for the time evolution.

So from the Heisenberg equation, we obtained that the expectation value <S_z(t)> satisfies the equation of harmonic oscillator with angular frequency gamma B. Hence, the oscillation frequency f is (gamma B)/(2 pi). Wait, wait, the problem says "oscillation frequency", which is nu = omega/(2 pi). But perhaps here, since we are talking about angular frequency vs regular frequency.

But in physics, sometimes people just refer to angular frequency as frequency when there is context. Let's remember that the solution to differential equation is cos(gamma B t), so the angular frequency omega is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B / (2 pi). But, the question is, how is gamma defined here?

Alternatively, perhaps there's an easier approach using the energy difference between eigenstates. Because when the Hamiltonian is along Y-direction, the eigenstates are |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ and E_-.

The energy eigenvalues for H_final = -gamma B S_y. Since S_y has eigenvalues +/- ħ/2, the energy eigenvalues would be E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = -gamma B (-ħ/2) ) = +gamma B (ħ/2). Therefore, the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B ħ. Therefore, the frequency of oscillation is (E_- - E_+)/ħ = gamma B. Thus, the angular frequency is gamma B. So omega = gamma B. Therefore, regular frequency nu = gamma B / (2 pi). But I think the problem just mentions "oscillation frequency", which can be omega. So in this case, the answer is gamma*B.

But to check, let's go through using the Schrödinger picture. The initial state is |+z>. Let's express this in terms of |+y> and |-y>. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> + i |−z>), |-y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> − i |−z>). Then, the state |+z> can be written as:

 |+z> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+y> + |-y> )

Therefore, at time t=0, the state is |psi(0)> = |+z> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+y> + |-y> )

Under the Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, each energy eigenstate evolves in time as |psi(t)> = exp(-i H t / ħ) |psi(0)> = 1/sqrt(2) [exp(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> + exp(-i E_- t / ħ) |-y> ]

Given that E_+ = - gamma B ħ / 2, and E_- = gamma B ħ / 2. So, substituting:

 |psi(t)> = 1/sqrt(2) [ exp(i gamma B t / 2) |+y> + exp(-i gamma B t / 2) |-y> ]

Then, to compute the expectation value <S_z>:

We know that S_z in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

 |+y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> + i |-z> )

Therefore, S_z acting on |+y> is S_z |+y> = 1/sqrt(2) (S_z |+z> + i S_z |-z> ) ) = 1/sqrt(2) ( (ħ/2) |+z> + i (-ħ/2) |-z> ) = 1/sqrt(2) ( ħ/2 |+z> - i ħ/2 |-z> ) = ħ/2 * 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> - i |-z> ) ) = ħ/2 |-y>.

Wait, wait: 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> - i |-z> ) is |-y>, since |+-y> = 1/sqrt(2) ( |+z> ∓ i |-z> )

Wait, standard definitions:

 |+y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> + i |-z> )

 |-y> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z> - i |-z> )

Hence, S_z |+y> = (1/sqrt(2)) [S_z |+z> + i S_z |-z>] = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (ħ/2)|+z> + i (-ħ/2)|-z> ].

This simplifies to (1/sqrt(2)) [ (ħ/2)|+z> - i (ħ/2)|-z> ] = (ħ/2)(1/sqrt(2)) [ |+z> - i |-z> ] ) = (ħ/2) |-y>

Similarly, S_z |-y> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ S_z |+z> - i S_z |-z> ] = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (ħ/2)|+z> - i (-ħ/2)|-z> ] = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (ħ/2)|+z> + i (ħ/2)|-z> ] = (ħ/2)(1/sqrt(2)) [ |+z> + i |-z> ] ) = (ħ/2) |+ y>

Therefore, the matrix representation of S_z in the Y basis is:

 <+y| S_z |+y> = (ħ/2)<+y| -y> ) = 0

 <+y| S_z |− y> = ħ/2 <+y|+ y> = ħ/2

 <− y| S_z |+ y> = ħ/2 <− y| - y> ) = 0

 <− y| S_z |− y> = (ħ/2)<− y|+ y> ) = 0

Wait, hold on. If S_z |+y> = ħ/2 |-y>,

then <+y| S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) <+y | -y> = 0,

<−y | S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) <−y | -y> = ħ/2,

Similarly, the matrix S_z in Y basis has non-zero entries off-diagonal.

Therefore, in the Y basis, S_z is:

S_z = [[ 0, ħ/2 ],
        [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

But perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again:

S_z |+y> = ħ2( / 2) |- y>, as we had above. So in the Y basis, the S_z matrix has elements:

< +y | S_z | +y > = (ħ/2 ) < +y | − y > = 0,

< +y | S_z | − y > = (ħ/2 ) < +y | +y > = ħ/2,

< − y | S_z | +y > = (ħ/2 ) < − y | − y > = ħ/2,

< − y | S_z | − y > = (ħ/2 ) < − y | − y > = 0? Wait, no. Wait, correction.

Wait, if S_z |+ y> = (ħ/2 ) | -y >, then <+y|S_z|+y> is (ħ/2) <+y | -y> = 0. But < -y | S_z | + y > = (ħ/2) < -y | -y > = ħ/2. Conversely, S_z | -y > = (ħ/2)| + y > , so < - y | S_z | - y > = (ħ/2) < - y | + y > = 0. Thus, S_z in the Y basis:

Rows and columns as +y, -y:

S_z = [
[ 0,     ħ/2 ],
[ ħ/2,  0 ]
]

Therefore, when we write |psi(t)> expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y> as:

 |psi(t)> = 1/sqrt(2) [ e^{i gamma B t / 2 } |+y> + e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } |- y > ]

And compute <S_z> in that state:

 <S_z> = < psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) > = Let's expand this:

It's 1/sqrt(2) [ e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } <+y| + e^{i gamma B t / 2 } <-y| ] * S_z * 1/sqrt(2) [ e^{i gamma B t / 2 } |+y> + e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } |- y > ]

When you multiply out the terms, due to S_z elements, only cross terms will contribute.

Breaking it down:

Term1: 1/2 e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } e^{i gamma B t / 2 } <+y| S_z |+y> = 1/2 <+y| S_z |+y> = 0

Term2: 1/2 e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } <+y| S_z |-y> = 1/2 e^{-i gamma B t } <+y| S_z |-y> = 1/2 e^{-i gamma B t } (ħ/2) δ_{+y, +y} ?? Wait, no. Wait, when you have <+y| S_z |-y>

From the matrix above, S_z |-y> is (ħ/2)|+y>, so <+y| S_z |- y> = (ħ/2) <+y| + y> = (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2.

Similarly, Term2: 1/2 e^{-i gamma B t } * (ħ/2)

Term3: 1/2 e^{i gamma B t / 2 } e^{i gamma B t / 2 } <-y| S_z |+y> = 1/2 e^{i gamma B t } <-y | S_z | + y> = (ħ/2) * (1/2) e^{i gamma B t }

Term4: 1/2 e^{i gamma B t / 2 } e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } <-y| S_z |-y> = 1/2 <-y| S_z |-y> = 0 

So combining Term2 and Term3:

< Sz > = (1/2)(e^{-i gamma B t } * ħ/2 + e^{i gamma B t } * ħ / 2 )

Factor out (ħ/4)[ e^{i gamma B t } + e^{-i gamma B t } ]= (ħ/4) * 2 cos(gamma B t) = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t)

Therefore, <S_z(t)> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Therefore, the expectation value of S_z oscillates as cos(gamma B t) with angular frequency omega = gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is gamma B / (2 pi), but in physics, like in Rabi oscillations, we often refer to the angular frequency, omega, as the oscillation frequency, so the answer here is the angular frequency gamma * B.

But let me check.

Alternatively, if we consider that the period is 2 pi / omega, so the frequency is omega / (2 pi). So here, if angular frequency is gamma*B, then the oscillation frequency (number of cycles per second) is gamma*B/(2 pi). However, the problem asks for the oscillation frequency, so technically, if we stick to the problem's phrasing, if they refer to the angular frequency, just write omega which is gamma*B. But in units where people are using, especially in spin precession, Lamor frequency is omega_L = gamma B, and when they refer to frequency, they mean omega_L. So in this problem, just gamma B.

Alternatively, perhaps Gyromagnetic ratio gamma is given. But the problem, however, in the situation specifies "mu (= gamma*S_z)", which is maybe angular. But for a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment might be mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.

But in the question:"magneti c moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction." So if mu = gamma * S_z, then each component would be something else.

Wait, actually, if they define mu as equal to gamma multiplied by Sz, then in this case, vectors aren't in play. Wait, but that seems odd because the magnetic moment is a vector quantity. So that would mean that when written as above, than mu_x and mu_y would just be zero, but when the magnetic field is turned on along Y, then how does the Hamiltonian change? Maybe the problem has a typo, such that mu is given as gamma*S, but with the note that when aligned along Z, so it was in the eigenstate. But maybe not. Alternatively, the particle was prepared with its magnetic moment (i.e., its average magnetic moment) along +Z (i.e., eigenstate of S_z).

But regardless, the final answer seems to be that the oscillation frequency is gamma*B.

But let's check solution thoroughly.

Another approach. The spin precess around the direction of the magnetic field. When the magnetic field is turned on along Y direction, the spin, which was initially along Z, starts precessing around Y. The precession frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is omega = gamma*B.

Therefore, when the spin precesses around Y-axis, the Z-component of the spin does indeed oscillate with frequency gamma*B. So the answer is gamma*B. So either way, whether you use Heisenberg's equation, or use the time evolution, or think of precession, you arrive at the same answer.

Therefore, the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is gamma*B, which is angular frequency. So the answer is omega = gamma B.

But to make sure, let's check the units. Let's confirm if gamma has appropriate units.

Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, which is defined as the ratio between the magnetic moment and the angular momentum. For example, in case of the electron, gamma_e = -e/(2 m_e) (the charge times gyromagnetic ratio). The unit of the gyromagnetic ratio is (C kg^{-1}) because magnetic moment has units of A m^2 (Ampere meter squared), and angular momentum has units of kg m^2 s^{-1}, so gamma = mu / S => (A m^2) / ( kg m^2 s^{-1} )) = A s kg^{-1} ), but Amp is Coulombs per second, so gamma has units of (C/s * s)/kg = C/kg. Alternatively, Tesla^{-1} s^{-1}, since when multiplying by B (Tesla), gamma*B would have units of s^{-1}.

Wait, gyromagnetic ratio's unit when multiplied by B (tesla), gives 1/seconds. For example, nuclear magneton is mu_N = eħ/(2 m_p), so gamma for a nucleus would be (mu_N)/(ħ/2), which is (eħ/(2 m_p )) / (ħ /2 ) = e/m_p, which has units of C/kg. Then gamma, when multiplied by B (Tesla, which is kg/(C s )), so gamma B would have units (C/kg)*(kg/(C s)) ) = 1/s, which is correct—angular frequency. So with that, gamma B indeed has units of angular frequency. So the answer is gamma B.

Therefore, the answer is gamma*B.

But wait, considering that gamma is originally defined as the proportionality constant between the magnetic moment and Sz, so perhaps the given gamma here is equivalent to the "gyromagnetic ratio" that intrinsically includes the necessary factors. Alternatively, given that if mu = gamma S_z, rather than the vector form mu = gamma S, then... Hmm. Wait, but mu is a vector, aligned with the spin. So for example, if the spin is aligned in an arbitrary direction, the magnetic moment should follow. Therefore, the correct general formula would be mu = gamma S. Then in the initial setting, the magnetic moment's operator is vector gamma S. Then Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. Therefore, for initial B along Z: H_initial = - gamma B S_z, then after, along Y: H_final= -gamma B S_y. So the same reasoning applies. Therefore, the conclusion stands, omega = gamma*B.

Therefore, the answer should be gamma B.

**Final Answer**
The oscillation frequency is \boxed{\gamma B}.

Wait, but to get the matrix elements in another basis (|±y>), we have to use the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, use explicit expressions of how S_z acts on |±y> states.\n\nRecall that |+y> = ( |+z> + i |–z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSo S_z |+y> = ( S_z |+z> + i S_z |–z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = ( (ħ/2) |+z> + i (-ħ/2) |–z> ) / sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, ⟨+y | S_z | +y ⟩ is, compute ( ⟨ +z | - i ⟨ –z | ) / sqrt(2) ) [ ( (ħ/2 |+z> ) + i (-ħ/2 |–z> ) ) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nWhich is (1/2) [ ⟨ +z| (ħ/2) |+z> + i ⟨ +z | (-ħ/2 i) |–z > ) - i ⟨ –z | (ħ/2 |+z> ) - i(-i) ⟨ –z| ( -ħ/2 ) |–z> ) ]\n\nCalculate term by term:\n\n⟨ +z | S_z | +y ⟩ / sqrt(2) --> Wait, maybe this is getting messy. Alternatively, look up the Pauli matrix in the y eigenbasis.\n\nWait, an alternative approach would be to write S_z in terms of S_y and transformation. For that, note that the S matrices in different coordinate systems can be related by a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s use spin operators in terms of Pauli matrices. Knowing that S_i = ħ/2 sigma_i.\n\nGiven the Pauli matrices:\n\nsigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nsigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]\n\nsigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nThe eigenstates of sigma_y are |+y> and |−y> which correspond to eigenvectors with eigenvalues +1 and -1. These states can be written in the z-basis (the standard basis for sigma_z).\n\nSimilarly, in the y-basis, the S_z operator is represented not as diagonal. Alternatively, perhaps it\'s convenient to switch the basis for S_z.\n\nAlternatively, because the time evolution is governed by H = -gamma B S_y, which is diagonal in the |+y>, |−y> basis. Therefore, in the |±y> basis, H would be a diagonal matrix with energies as ( -gamma B ħ/2, gamma B ħ/2 ).\n\nThe state psi(0) = |+z> expressed in the |+y>, |−y> basis is:\n\nSo in the y-basis, |+z> is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt{2} and |−z> is -i ( |+y> - |−y> ) /sqrt{2}\n\nTherefore, the initial state is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt{2}; in the y-basis, $|\\psi(0)\\rangle = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right)/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTime evolution of the state in the energy eigenbasis (which is the y-basis here) is that each component picks up a phase factor:\n\n$|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{-i E_+ t/\\hbar} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i E_- t/\\hbar} |−y\\rangle \\right)$.\n\nPlugging in E_+ = -\\gamma B \\hbar/2 and E_- = \\gamma B \\hbar/2, we have:\n\n$|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i \\gamma B t / 2} |+y\\rangle + e^{-i \\gamma B t / 2} |−y\\rangle \\right)$.\n\nNow, the state\'s time evolution done, next we need to find the expectation value of S_z. Since S_z in the standard z-basis is diagonal. To find ⟨S_z⟩ \\= ħ/2 (|c_1|^2 - |c_2|^2 ) where c_1 and c_2 are the coefficients in the |+z> and |−z> basis. However, since our current state is in the y-basis, we need to express the components in the z-basis or find a way to compute S_z in the y-basis.\n\nWait, to compute ⟨S_z⟩, we can do it two ways: either transform the state back into the z-basis and then compute the expectation value, or compute the operator S_z in the y-basis. Let me attempt the latter.\n\nLet me recall that S_z, S_y’s relations. How to express S_z in terms of S_y eigenbasis. Since |±y〉are states rotated by π/2 about the x-axis from the z-axis. Therefore, the operator S_z under this rotation (since rotation around x-axis by θ changes S_z to S_z cosθ + S_y sinθ ?, no, Wait rotations affect the components as in SU(2). Let us approach this by finding the matrix for S_z in the |±y〉 basis.\n\nSince the states for Sy are |+y〉and |−y〉, and we can write the matrix elements of S_z in this basis as:\n\n⟨+y| S_z |+y〉, ⟨+y| S_z |-y〉, ⟨-y| S_z |-y〉, etc.\n\nUse the expressions of |±y〉 in terms of |±z〉, which is known.\n\nStart with S_z | +y 〉:\n\nSy | +y〉= (ħ/2) | +y〉. But to compute S_z | +y〉, which is:\n\nS_z | +y〉= S_z (| +z〉+ i | -z〉)/sqrt{2} ) = ( ħ/2 | +z〉 + i ( -ħ/2 ) | -z〉 ) /sqrt{2} = ( ħ / (2 sqrt{2} ) [ | +z 〉 - i | -z 〉 ])\n\nThen, to calculate ⟨ +y | S_z | +y〉= [ ( 〈 +z | - i 〈 -z | ) / sqrt{2 } ] * [ ( ħ / (2 sqrt{2} ) [ | +z 〉 - i | -z 〉 ] ]\n\n= (ħ / (4 ) ) [ 〈 +z | +z 〉 + i 〈 +z | -z 〉 + (−i ) 〈 -z | +z 〉 - ( -i ) ( i ) 〈 -z | -z 〉 ]\n\nSimplifies to (ħ/4)(1 + 0 + 0 - (-i^2)(1)) = (ħ/4)(1 - (-( -1 )) )= (ħ/4)(1 - 1 ) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, computing ⟨ +y | S_z |- y〉:\n\nBut let\'s actually compute all matrix elements.\n\nAlternatively, use the spin rotation matrices. Since a state |+y〉is obtained by rotating |+z〉about the x-axis by -π/2. So in general, the rotation operators will allows us to change basis. However, maybe it\'s more straightforward choice to compute matrix elements for S_z in the y-basis.\n\nAlternatively, recognize that in any basis, S_j (j=x,y,z) have the same commutation relations, but the operator\'s components here affect the matrix representations. Alternatively, using ladder operators.\n\nBut another idea: we can calculate ⟨ S_z \\rangle as (ħ/2) times the expectation of the Pauli-z matrix sigma_z. But since sigma_z can be written in terms of sigma_y and others. Perhaps it\'s easier to switch back to the z-basis. Wait, if the state is expressed in the y-basis, but we have the expressions for S_z in the z-basis. However, perhaps the calculation we need is of the matrix elements of S_z between the |+y〉 and |−y> states.\n\nGiven that | +y 〉 = ( | +z〉 + i |−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 }, and similarly for |−y〉, then S_z is diagonal in the z-basis. So any matrix element⟨ a | S_z | b ⟩ between states in the y-basis can be expressed as⟨ a | S_z | b ⟩, where a and b are in the y-basis. \n\nLet me compute this.\n\nCompute ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩:\n\nTake the state |+y〉= ( |+z〉 + i |−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 }, acting with S_z yields:\n\nS_z |+y〉= ( S_z |+z〉 + i S_z |−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 } = ( (ħ/2) |+z〉 + i (-ħ/2)|−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 } \n\nThen the inner product ⟨+y| S_z |+y〉 becomes:\n\n[ 〈+z| - i 〈−z| ] / sqrt{2 } times [  ( (ħ/2) |+z〉 + i (-ħ/2)|−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 } ]\n\nExpanding the product:\n\n(1/2)[ 〈+z| (ħ/2)|+z〉 + 〈+z| (i ( -ħ/2 )) |−z〉 - i 〈−z| (ħ/2) | +z〉 - i (i ) 〈−z| (−ħ/2 )| −z〉 ]\n\nEvaluating term by term:\n\n1. 〈+z| (ħ/2 ) | +z〉 = ħ/2\n\n2. 〈+z| ( -i ħ/2 ) | −z〉 = 0\n\n3. -i 〈−z| (ħ/2 ) | +z〉 = -i*(ħ/2)*0 = 0\n\n4. -i* i 〈 −z | (-ħ/2 ) | −z 〉 = -i^2 * (-ħ/2) )= -(-1)(-ħ/2 ) = -( ħ/2 )\n\nTherefore overall:\n\n(1/2)[ ( ħ/2 ) - ( ħ/2 ) ] = 0. So ⟨+y| S_z | +y ⟩ = 0.\n\nSimilarly ⟨−y | S_z | −y ⟩ = 0 by the same calculation.\n\nThen compute ⟨ +y | S_z | − y ⟩:\n\nFirst, |−y〉= ( |1+z› − i |−z› ) / sqrt{2 }\n\nS_z |−y〉= ( S_z |+z〉 − i S_z |−z› ) / sqrt{2 } = ( (ħ/2 ) |+z〉 - i (-ħ/2 ) |−z› ) / sqrt{2 )\n\nSo:\n\n⟨+y| S_z | − y ⟩ = [ ( 〈 +z | − i 〈 −z | ) / sqrt{2 } ] • [ ( ħ/2 |+z 〉 + i ħ/2 |−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 } ]\n\nMultiply out:\n\n(1/2 ) [ 〈 +z | ħ/2 | +z 〉 + 〈 +z | i ħ/2 | −z 〉 + (-i ) 〈 −z | ħ/2 | + z 〉 + (-i )(i ) 〈 −z | i ħ/2 | −z \u202f ) ]\n\nFocusing term by term:\n\n1. 〈 +z | ħ/2 | +z 〉 = ħ/2\n2. 〈 +z | i ħ / 2 | −z 〉 = 0\n3.

Therefore term4 is 1 * i * ħ / 2 = i ħ /2\n\nThus, adding up all terms after scaling by 1/2:\n\n(1/2 ) [ ħ/2 + 0 + 0 + i ħ / 2 ] = (1/2 )( ( ħ / 2 )(1 + i ) ) = ħ (1 + i ) / 4 \n\nBut wait, this seems complex. But ⟨ +y | S_z | −y ⟩ should be a complex number.\n\nWait, but calculating S_z\'s matrix elements in the y-basis:\n- ⟨ +y | S_z | +y ⟩ = 0\n- ⟨ −y | S_z |−y ⟩= 0 \n- ⟨ +y | S_z |−y ⟩ = [ (1/2 ) times (ħ/2 + i (ħ/2 )) ] as above? Wait:\n\nWait, given in this calculation:\n\nLet’s take the expression (1/2)[ ħ/2 + iħ/2 ]\n\nNoting that ⟨ +y | S_z | − y ⟩ = (1/2) * ( ħ/2 + i ħ / 2 ). Wait, wait; actually, let\'s recast the fourth term properly.\n\nWait, in the fourth term, actually:\n\nOriginal: (1/2)[ 〈 +z | (ħ/2) |+z〉 + 〈 +z | (i ( -ħ/2 )) |−z〉 plus other terms. ]\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let\'s correct:\n\nWait our psi(t) is in terms of |+y> and |−y> states. When taking the inner product of ⟨ +y | S_z | −y⟩, we have components that may result in complex numbers. However, the expectation value we are to compute should be real, as ⟨ S_z ⟩ is observable.\n\nBut if there\'s an error here, perhaps I should use orthogonal methods.\n\nSince S_z is diagonal in the z-basis:\n\nConsider that |+y〉and |-y〉are each ( |+z〉 + i |−z〉)/sqrt{2} and ( |+z〉 - i |−z〉)/sqrt{2} respectively. Then, to obtain ( |+y〉, |-y〉) basis transformation to ( |+z〉,  |−z〉).\n\nUsing matrix notation. Let me represent |+y〉as a column vector:\n\nIn the z basis, [1, i ]^T /sqrt{2 }, and |-y〉as [1, -i ]^T /sqrt{2 }. Then, S_z matrix is ħ/2 [ [1,0 ], [0, -1 ] ]\n\nTo change basis to |+y〉and |-y〉, we can compute the transformed matrix.\n\nAlternatively note that a general matrix element of S_z in the y-basis is given by [y_i | S_z | y_j )].\n\nGiven that, the full S_z matrix in the y-basis would be:\n\nRow 1, Column 1: ⟨ +y | S_z | +y ⟩ }= 0\nRow 1, Column 2: ⟨ +y | S_z | −y ⟩ }= (1/2)( ħ / 2 + i * ħ / 2 )= (1/2)*( ħ/2 (1 + i )) = ħ/4 (1 + i )\n\nSimilarly Row 2, Column 1: ⟨ −y | S_z | +y ⟩ }= complex conjugate of ⟨ +y | S_z | −y ⟩} = ħ /4 (1 - i )\n\nRow 2, Column 2: 0.\n\nBut, wait, this seems inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe using Pauli matrices.\n\nAlternatively, remembering that in the y eigenbasis, other spin components (x and z) will have some form.\n\nSince sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]] in the z basis. The transformation to the y basis is done by a unitary matrix corresponding to rotation?\n\nAlternatively,  consider that:\nThe y eigenbasis is related to the z eigenbasis by a rotation of π/2 about the X-axis. The rotation operator is R_x(π/2) = e^{-i (\\pi/2) S_x / ħ } \n\nFor spin-1/2, S_x = ħ/2 sigma_x. Thus, R_x(theta) = e^{-i theta/2 sigma_x }, so R_x(π/2 ) = e^{- i π/4 sigma_x }.\n\nWhich is equal to cos(π/4) I - i sin( pi/4 ) sigma_x = [ sqrt(2)/2 ([[1,0], [0,1]] ) - i ( sqrt{2}/2 [[0,1],[1,0]] ) ] \n\nTherefore, R_x(π/2 ) = (1/sqrt{2}) [[1, -i ], [ -i, 1 ]] ... Wait, no. Wait:\n\nLet me compute e^{-i theta/2 sigma_x }. Note that for any Pauli matrix. since sigma_x^2 = 1, so e^{i theta sigma_x } = I cos(theta ) + i sigma_x sin(theta ). Therefore, R_x( pi / 2 ) would be e^{-i (pi/4) sigma_x } = cos( pi/4 ) I -i sin( pi/4 ) sigma_x ) = sqrt(2)/2 ( I -i sigma_x )\n\nExpressed:\n\nsqrt(2)/2 [ [1, 0] [0,1] ] -i sqrt(2)/2 [ [0,1],[1,0] ]\n\n= sqrt(2)/2 [ [1, -i], [-i, 1] ]\n\nTherefore, the columns of R_x(pi/2) )^† (which transforms from z to y basis) aren\'t the standard |+y> vectors. Wait, actually in standard conventions, perhaps another way. Anyway, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.\n\nAn alternative smart move: The time evolution induces a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, note that in quantum mechanics, when you have Hamiltonian proportional to S_y (H = w S_y ), the time evolution is a rotation about the y-axis, which causes the spin component perpendicular to y to precess around y with frequency w. So if the spin starts along z, and in a field along y, the spin vector (expectation) rotates around y with frequency determined by the Hamiltonian coefficient.\n\nBut in our case, H = - gamma B S_y, so the angular frequency about the y-axis is w = dphi/dt = - gamma B. Wait:\n\nAlternatively, Recall that the expectation value satisfies the equation d⟨S⟩/dt = ( 1/(iħ) ) \u202f ⟨[S, H] ⟩, and using the Ehrenfest theorem.

If you compute:\n\n(1/iħ)( - gamma B * i hbar ⟨ S_z ⟩ )\n\n= ( - gamma B i hbar / i hbar ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ )\n\ni / i is 1, hbar cancels, - gamma B⟨ S_z ⟩\n\nWait, so it\'s: (1/i ħ)( - gamma B i ħ ) ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ = ( ( - gamma B ) (i ħ / i ħ ) ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ = - gamma B ⟨ S_z ⟩\n\nWait Now, reconciling this... the equation is:\n\nd⟨S_x⟩/dt = (1/(iħ))*(-gamma B i ħ ) ) ⟨Sz〉 = (-gamma B ) (i ħ)/i ħ )⟨Sz〉} = - gamma B ⟨ Sz 〉\n\nWait, let me do more carefully:\n\nCalculation:\n\ngamma = gyromagnetic ratio,\n\nH = - gamma B S_y \n\nABuse notation here: Then, [ S_x, H ] = - gamma B [ S_x, S_y ] = - gamma B i ħ S_z \n\nThen (1/i ħ) * [ comm ] = (1/(i ħ )) [ - gamma B i ħ ⟨ S_z ⟩ ]\n\n= (1/i ħ ) ( - gamma B i ħ ) ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ \n\ns and then:\n\n= ( - gamma B (i ħ / (i ħ )) ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ = - gamma B ⟨ S_z ⟩\n\nTherefore, system of equations:\n\nd⟨S_z〉/dt = gamma B ⟨ S_x 〉\n\nd⟨S_x〉/dt = - gamma B ⟨ S_z 〉 \n\nSo the flow maps ⟨S_z〉and⟨S_x〉to their derivatives. So derivative of each variable orthogonal:\n\nThe same as:\n\nd²⟨S_z〉 /dt² = gamma B d⟨ S_x ⟩/dt = gamma B ( - gamma B ⟨ S_z 〉 ) = - ( gamma B )² ⟨ S_z 〉 \n\nThus, the differential equation:\n\nd2/dt2 ⟨ S_z 〉 + ( gamma B )² ⟨ S_z 〉=0\n\nSo this is SHM with angular frequency omega=gamma B. Therefore, expectation⟨S_z〉will oscillate like cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is omega=gamma B, corresponding to frequency f=(gamma B ) / (2 pi )\n\nBut the question states \'oscillation frequency\', and towards the standard physics convention, we can refer in terms of angular frequency (often called frequency).If they want angular frequency, answer is gamma B. If the answer expects in Hz (oscillations per second), need to consider factors with 2 pi. But in QM contexts, "Larmor frequency" here is gamma B.\n\nBut check rigorously: \n\nGiven the differential equation:\n\n⟨ S_z(t) 〉= A cos( gamma B t ) + B sin( gamma B t )\n\nHence, oscillation frequency is omega=gamma B (angular frequency).Hence the answer is gamma B. Considering the units: gamma here has units= (frequency)/(field), B is field, hence gammaB with have freq<｜place▁holder▁no▁50｜>: confirming units make sense.\n\nYes, the alternated approach via Heisenberg equation puts it in to result SHM for the observable⟨S_z〉.\n\nThus, even though we had a back and forth calculation over different methods, merges to the same conclusion. And another sanity check: the Larmor precession frequency is omega=gamma B. But, since here the field is along Y (the initial field along Z was turned off), once we apply field along Y, precession should happen about Y-axis. So spin will precess around Y causing 〈S_z〉 and 〈S_x〉 to oscillate. Time period would be similar to Larmor precession, i.e., equation results in angular frequency 2pi*f = gamma B.\n\nGiven the problem says the average starts oscillating. The conventional frequency would be (gamma B)/2 pi but they might asking for the angular frequency. The problem just says "frequency", if unqualified usually means angular in theoreticql contexts. But question says "oscillating," but to check in old exams: example like spin precession frequency. Well, given the exponent in time is omega*t, coupling after answer.\n\nIn shown solution, conslusion: frequency is gamma*B. But wait, wait the Hamiltonian terms and the Heisenberg equations.\n\nMaybe I should rederive or have a typo.\n\nGiven that \n\nAh without excuse me resume:\n\nFrom starting Hamiltonia: initial in z, turn off, then turn on along y direction. The new Hamiltonian is H=-gamma B S_y. The time evolution can be written as exp( -i H t / ħ ), Which depends, the energy levels. From hte Heisnberg equation if you track  〈S_z〉to see that it evolve sinusoidally at frequency gamma*B.\n\nIn another view, the Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B will be the frequency at which spin precesses about the applied field. But since the initial spin is along z, then switching the field to y, the spin precesses about y. In this case, precession about y-axis at angular frequency gamma*B. This causes 〈S_z〉to oscillate sinusoidally with the same frequency.\n\nSo my above analysis in Heisenberg picture gives this answer, thats the frequency must be gamma*B.\n\nHence, answer is nu = gamma*B / 2  or but not. Wait, the frequency is omega = gamma*B [ angular ]. For usual notion of oscillation frequency (“Hz” ), which is f = omega/(2 pi ), but the physical oscillation frequency from parameters would have angular frequency gamma*B. The question mentions, "oscillation frequency", seems the answer is omega= gamma B.\n\nHowever, need to check original quantum mechanics.\n\nAlternatively, revisiting a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field. Energy splitting E=-gamma B S_y, state expressed in y basis implying oscillations between the energy eigenstates superposition in phases. What\'s the difference in energy? E_+−E_- =-gamma B ( ħ/2 ) − gamma B ħ/2 } Probability coefficient differences / fase terms have exponent (-i E_+ t/ ħ + i E_- t/ ħ )=−i [ E_+ - E_- ] t/ ħ. Since E_+ - E_- = - gamma B ħ, then phase is stack in:\n\ne^{ i gamma B t}\n\nThus period T=(2pi)/( gamma B ), so frequency f=gamma B/(2 ). Except actually:\n\nThe energy separation Δ E= ( E_+ - E_- )= -gamma B ħ. Thus, the frequency is Δ E / ħ = -gamma B\n\nWithout the sign, |Δ E | / ħ = gamma B. Therefore, the f= gamma B/( 2 pi ). Hmm. So it\'s related to photons frequency omega=E/ħ. Thus the phasors would oscillate as:\n\n⟨ S_z(t) 〉= Re[ stuff e^{i (Δ E / ħ ) t } ] → the angular frequency is Δ E / ħ = gamma B\n\nSpecifically, using the states.\n\nAs we saw from state evolution:\n\npsi(t) = [ |+y〉e^{i gamma B t /2 } + |− y〉e^{– i gamma B t /2 }]/ sqrt{2} }. Now, expanding this in terms of z:\n\nBut since |+y〉 = ( |+z〉+i |−z〉)/sqrt{2}, psi(t ) = [ ( |＋z 〉 + i |－z〉 ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + ( |＋z 〉 – i ) |−z〉 ) e^{− i gamma B t/2 } ] / [ 2 ]\n\n= [ |+z〉( e^{ i gamma B t/2 } + e^{-i gamma B t /2 }  ) + i |−z〉( e^{ i gamma B t /2 } – e^{-i gamma Bt /2 } ) ] / 2\n\n= [ |+z〉* 2 cos( gamma Bt /2) + i |−z〉 * 2 i sin (gamma B t/2 ) ] / 2\n\n= |+z〉 cos( gamma B t /2 ) + (i^2 ) |−z〉 sin (gamma B t/2 )\n\n= |+z〉 cos( gamma B t /2 ) – |−z〉 sin (gamma B t /2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\n| psi(t)〉= cos( gamma B t /2 ) |+z〉- sin( gamma B t /2 ) |−z〉\n\nTherefore, the state probabilities oscillation lead to:\n\n〈 S_z 〉 = (ħ/2)( | c_1 |² - | c2 |² )= (ħ/2)[ cos²( gamma B t /2 ) – sin^2( gamma B t /2 ) ]= ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )\n\nWhich is obviously a cos that oscillates at frequency gamma B, since the argument of cos is gamma B t (as gamma B t’ argument.\n\nWait, wait, inserting the total time component,\n\nYes: cos squared(theta) - sin squared(theta) = cos{ 2 theta }\n\nBut in the above, for〈S_z〉it\'s (ℏ/2 ) cos{gamma B t}\n\nYes: Indeed,\n\ngamma_bt_half = (gamma B t)/2,\n\nSo, cos²(gamma_bt_half ) - sin²(gamma_bt_half) = cos( gamma B t )\n\nThus,〈 S_z〉= ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )\n\nHence the oscillations in Z component have angular frequency omega=gamma B\n\nThus, after analysis following multiple methods (Heisnberg、Schrodinger picture、differential equations of motion), I conclude oscillation frequency isgamma * B hence, in box form, \\boxed{\\gamma B}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743814645, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8679, prompt_tokens=898, total_tokens=9577, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle whose magnetic moment is initially aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. When the field is suddenly switched to the +Y direction, we need to determine the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The initial Hamiltonian is \( H_{\text{initial}} = -\gamma B S_z \), and the particle is in the eigenstate \( |+z\rangle \).

2. **New Hamiltonian**:
   - After the switch, the Hamiltonian becomes \( H_{\text{final}} = -\gamma B S_y \).

3. **Time Evolution**:
   - The eigenstates of \( S_y \) are \( |+y\rangle \) and \( |-y\rangle \). The initial state \( |+z\rangle \) is expressed as a superposition of these eigenstates:
     \[
     |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|+y\rangle + i |-y\rangle)
     \]

4. **Time Evolution of the State**:
   - Under the new Hamiltonian, the state evolves in time as:
     \[
     |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle e^{i \gamma B t / 2} + i |-y\rangle e^{-i \gamma B t / 2} \right)
     \]

5. **Expectation Value of \( S_z \)**:
   - Transforming back to the \( |+z\rangle \) and \( |-z\rangle \) basis, the state is:
     \[
     |\psi(t)\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |+z\rangle - \sin\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) |-z\rangle
     \]
   - The expectation value \( \langle S_z \rangle \) is:
     \[
     \langle S_z(t) \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \cos^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) - \sin^2\left(\frac{\gamma B t}{2}\right) \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)
     \]

6. **Oscillation Frequency**:
   - The time dependence of \( \langle S_z(t) \rangle \) is a cosine function with angular frequency \( \gamma B \), indicating an oscillation frequency of \( \gamma B \).

Final Answer:
\boxed{\gamma B}

 But let me check:

Alternatively, using the energy eigenstates. The Hamiltonian H_final is proportional to S_y, so the energy levels are E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2) and E_- = -gamma B ħ/2. The initial state |up⟩ can be expressed as a superposition of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. Writing |up⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩:

|+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + i |-y⟩)/sqrt(2), which comes from the fact that, for example, |+y⟩ = (|up⟩ + i |down⟩)/sqrt{2}, then |up⟩ = (|+y⟩ + i |-y⟩)/sqrt{2} ?

Actually, let's confirm that:

The eigenstates of S_y can be written as: 
|±y⟩ = ( |+z⟩ ± i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt{2} 

Therefore, to express |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, invert this relationship. Using:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt{2}
|−y⟩ = ( |+z⟩ − i |−z⟩ ) / sqrt{2}

Solving for |+z⟩:
Multiply |+y⟩ by 1 and |−y⟩ by 1 and add them:

|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ = [ |+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ + |+z⟩ − i |−z⟩ ] / sqrt{2} = (2 |+z⟩)/sqrt{2} → |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩) / sqrt{2}

But that can't be. Wait, let me compute more carefully:

Actually, there might be a phase difference here. Alternately from Sakurai, whose typical approach for spin 1/2:

The spin eigenstates for S_y can be written as:
|+y⟩ = 1/sqrt{2} (|+z⟩ + i |−z⟩ )
|−y⟩ = 1/sqrt{2} (|+z⟩ − i |−z⟩ )

Then, solving for |+z⟩: |+z⟩ = (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩)/sqrt{2}

Similarly, |−z⟩ = -i (|+y⟩ − |−y⟩)/sqrt{2}

Given the initial state is |+z⟩, which is: (|+y⟩ + |−y⟩ ) /sqrt{2}

Time evolution under H = -gamma B S_y. Since energy eigenstates are |+y⟩ and |−y⟩, the time evolution of the state is:

|psi(t)⟩ = [ |+y⟩ e^{-i E_+ t / ħ } + |−y⟩ e^{-i E_- t / ħ } ] / sqrt{2}

We need E_+ and E_- from H:

H = -gamma B S_y, so the eigenvalues for H would be for |+y⟩: H|+y⟩ = -gamma B ( ħ/2 ) |+y⟩ = -gamma B ħ/2 |+y⟩

Similarly for |−y⟩: H|−y⟩ = -gamma B (-ħ/2 ) |−y⟩ = gamma B ħ/2 |−y⟩

But the energies are E_+ = - gamma B ħ/2 and E_- = gamma B ħ/2. Wait, that seems inverted because H is proportional to S_y with a negative sign? Wait:

Wait, H is defined as -gamma B S_y. So S_y |+y⟩ = ħ/2 |+y⟩, so H |+y⟩ = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y⟩, so H has eigenvalue - gamma B ħ/2 for |+y⟩, and eigenvalue gamma B ħ/2 for |−y⟩.

Therefore the state |psi(t)⟩ is:

[ |+y⟩ e^{-i (-gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ} + |−y⟩ e^{-i (gamma B ħ/2) t / ħ } ] / sqrt{2}

Simplify exponents:

= [ |+y⟩ e^{i gamma B t / 2} + |−y⟩ e^{-i gamma B t / 2} ] / sqrt{2}

Let me factor out e^{i gamma B t /2}:

= e^{i gamma B t / 2} [ |+y⟩ + |−y⟩ e^{-i gamma B t }] / sqrt{2}

But perhaps it's better to carry on the expression:

⟨ S_z(t) ⟩ = ⟨ psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) ⟩

First, express S_z in terms of |+y⟩ and |−y⟩:

Because |+y⟩ and |−y⟩ are eigenstates of S_y, but we need to find S_z in this basis.

Alternately, since S_z is represented in the |+z⟩, |−z⟩ basis as ħ/2 Pauli matrix sigma_z. To express it in the |+y⟩, |−y⟩ basis, construct it.

Alternatively, compute the expectation value of S_z in state | psi(t) >:

Since initial state is |+z >, expressed in terms of the |+y>, |−y> states.

But |+z> = (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt(2)

Then | psi(t) > = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t / 2} + |−y> e^{-i gamma B t /2 } ] / sqrt(2)

Therefore, express this as a column vector:

In the |+y>, |−y> basis:

psi(t) = [ e^{i gamma B t / 2 }, e^{-i gamma B t /2 } ]^T / sqrt(2)

We need to compute ⟨ psi(t) | S_z | psi(t) ⟩. For this, we need S_z matrix in the |+y>, |−y> basis.

Alternatively, use the fact that:

The expectation value of S_z in |+y> is ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩

Compute S_z as a matrix in the |±z> basis. Wait, but to get the matrix elements in another basis (|±y>), we have to use the transformation.

Alternatively, use explicit expressions of how S_z acts on |±y> states.

Recall that |+y> = ( |+z> + i |–z> ) / sqrt(2)

So S_z |+y> = ( S_z |+z> + i S_z |–z> ) / sqrt(2) ) = ( (ħ/2) |+z> + i (-ħ/2) |–z> ) / sqrt(2)

Similarly, ⟨+y | S_z | +y ⟩ is, compute ( ⟨ +z | - i ⟨ –z | ) / sqrt(2) ) [ ( (ħ/2 |+z> ) + i (-ħ/2 |–z> ) ) ] / sqrt(2)

Which is (1/2) [ ⟨ +z| (ħ/2) |+z> + i ⟨ +z | (-ħ/2 i) |–z > ) - i ⟨ –z | (ħ/2 |+z> ) - i(-i) ⟨ –z| ( -ħ/2 ) |–z> ) ]

Calculate term by term:

⟨ +z | S_z | +y ⟩ / sqrt(2) --> Wait, maybe this is getting messy. Alternatively, look up the Pauli matrix in the y eigenbasis.

Wait, an alternative approach would be to write S_z in terms of S_y and transformation. For that, note that the S matrices in different coordinate systems can be related by a rotation.

Alternatively, let's use spin operators in terms of Pauli matrices. Knowing that S_i = ħ/2 sigma_i.

Given the Pauli matrices:

sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]

sigma_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]

sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The eigenstates of sigma_y are |+y> and |−y> which correspond to eigenvectors with eigenvalues +1 and -1. These states can be written in the z-basis (the standard basis for sigma_z).

Similarly, in the y-basis, the S_z operator is represented not as diagonal. Alternatively, perhaps it's convenient to switch the basis for S_z.

Alternatively, because the time evolution is governed by H = -gamma B S_y, which is diagonal in the |+y>, |−y> basis. Therefore, in the |±y> basis, H would be a diagonal matrix with energies as ( -gamma B ħ/2, gamma B ħ/2 ).

The state psi(0) = |+z> expressed in the |+y>, |−y> basis is:

So in the y-basis, |+z> is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt{2} and |−z> is -i ( |+y> - |−y> ) /sqrt{2}

Therefore, the initial state is (|+y> + |−y>)/sqrt{2}; in the y-basis, $|\psi(0)\rangle = \left( \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \end{array} \right)/\sqrt{2}$.

Time evolution of the state in the energy eigenbasis (which is the y-basis here) is that each component picks up a phase factor:

$|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-i E_+ t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-i E_- t/\hbar} |−y\rangle \right)$.

Plugging in E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar/2 and E_- = \gamma B \hbar/2, we have:

$|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i \gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i \gamma B t / 2} |−y\rangle \right)$.

Now, the state's time evolution done, next we need to find the expectation value of S_z. Since S_z in the standard z-basis is diagonal. To find ⟨S_z⟩ \= ħ/2 (|c_1|^2 - |c_2|^2 ) where c_1 and c_2 are the coefficients in the |+z> and |−z> basis. However, since our current state is in the y-basis, we need to express the components in the z-basis or find a way to compute S_z in the y-basis.

Wait, to compute ⟨S_z⟩, we can do it two ways: either transform the state back into the z-basis and then compute the expectation value, or compute the operator S_z in the y-basis. Let me attempt the latter.

Let me recall that S_z, S_y’s relations. How to express S_z in terms of S_y eigenbasis. Since |±y〉are states rotated by π/2 about the x-axis from the z-axis. Therefore, the operator S_z under this rotation (since rotation around x-axis by θ changes S_z to S_z cosθ + S_y sinθ ?, no, Wait rotations affect the components as in SU(2). Let us approach this by finding the matrix for S_z in the |±y〉 basis.

Since the states for Sy are |+y〉and |−y〉, and we can write the matrix elements of S_z in this basis as:

⟨+y| S_z |+y〉, ⟨+y| S_z |-y〉, ⟨-y| S_z |-y〉, etc.

Use the expressions of |±y〉 in terms of |±z〉, which is known.

Start with S_z | +y 〉:

Sy | +y〉= (ħ/2) | +y〉. But to compute S_z | +y〉, which is:

S_z | +y〉= S_z (| +z〉+ i | -z〉)/sqrt{2} ) = ( ħ/2 | +z〉 + i ( -ħ/2 ) | -z〉 ) /sqrt{2} = ( ħ / (2 sqrt{2} ) [ | +z 〉 - i | -z 〉 ])

Then, to calculate ⟨ +y | S_z | +y〉= [ ( 〈 +z | - i 〈 -z | ) / sqrt{2 } ] * [ ( ħ / (2 sqrt{2} ) [ | +z 〉 - i | -z 〉 ] ]

= (ħ / (4 ) ) [ 〈 +z | +z 〉 + i 〈 +z | -z 〉 + (−i ) 〈 -z | +z 〉 - ( -i ) ( i ) 〈 -z | -z 〉 ]

Simplifies to (ħ/4)(1 + 0 + 0 - (-i^2)(1)) = (ħ/4)(1 - (-( -1 )) )= (ħ/4)(1 - 1 ) = 0.

Similarly, computing ⟨ +y | S_z |- y〉:

But let's actually compute all matrix elements.

Alternatively, use the spin rotation matrices. Since a state |+y〉is obtained by rotating |+z〉about the x-axis by -π/2. So in general, the rotation operators will allows us to change basis. However, maybe it's more straightforward choice to compute matrix elements for S_z in the y-basis.

Alternatively, recognize that in any basis, S_j (j=x,y,z) have the same commutation relations, but the operator's components here affect the matrix representations. Alternatively, using ladder operators.

But another idea: we can calculate ⟨ S_z \rangle as (ħ/2) times the expectation of the Pauli-z matrix sigma_z. But since sigma_z can be written in terms of sigma_y and others. Perhaps it's easier to switch back to the z-basis. Wait, if the state is expressed in the y-basis, but we have the expressions for S_z in the z-basis. However, perhaps the calculation we need is of the matrix elements of S_z between the |+y〉 and |−y> states.

Given that | +y 〉 = ( | +z〉 + i |−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 }, and similarly for |−y〉, then S_z is diagonal in the z-basis. So any matrix element⟨ a | S_z | b ⟩ between states in the y-basis can be expressed as⟨ a | S_z | b ⟩, where a and b are in the y-basis. 

Let me compute this.

Compute ⟨+y| S_z |+y⟩:

Take the state |+y〉= ( |+z〉 + i |−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 }, acting with S_z yields:

S_z |+y〉= ( S_z |+z〉 + i S_z |−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 } = ( (ħ/2) |+z〉 + i (-ħ/2)|−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 } 

Then the inner product ⟨+y| S_z |+y〉 becomes:

[ 〈+z| - i 〈−z| ] / sqrt{2 } times [  ( (ħ/2) |+z〉 + i (-ħ/2)|−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 } ]

Expanding the product:

(1/2)[ 〈+z| (ħ/2)|+z〉 + 〈+z| (i ( -ħ/2 )) |−z〉 - i 〈−z| (ħ/2) | +z〉 - i (i ) 〈−z| (−ħ/2 )| −z〉 ]

Evaluating term by term:

1. 〈+z| (ħ/2 ) | +z〉 = ħ/2

2. 〈+z| ( -i ħ/2 ) | −z〉 = 0

3. -i 〈−z| (ħ/2 ) | +z〉 = -i*(ħ/2)*0 = 0

4. -i* i 〈 −z | (-ħ/2 ) | −z 〉 = -i^2 * (-ħ/2) )= -(-1)(-ħ/2 ) = -( ħ/2 )

Therefore overall:

(1/2)[ ( ħ/2 ) - ( ħ/2 ) ] = 0. So ⟨+y| S_z | +y ⟩ = 0.

Similarly ⟨−y | S_z | −y ⟩ = 0 by the same calculation.

Then compute ⟨ +y | S_z | − y ⟩:

First, |−y〉= ( |1+z› − i |−z› ) / sqrt{2 }

S_z |−y〉= ( S_z |+z〉 − i S_z |−z› ) / sqrt{2 } = ( (ħ/2 ) |+z〉 - i (-ħ/2 ) |−z› ) / sqrt{2 )

So:

⟨+y| S_z | − y ⟩ = [ ( 〈 +z | − i 〈 −z | ) / sqrt{2 } ] • [ ( ħ/2 |+z 〉 + i ħ/2 |−z〉 ) / sqrt{2 } ]

Multiply out:

(1/2 ) [ 〈 +z | ħ/2 | +z 〉 + 〈 +z | i ħ/2 | −z 〉 + (-i ) 〈 −z | ħ/2 | + z 〉 + (-i )(i ) 〈 −z | i ħ/2 | −z   ) ]

Focusing term by term:

1. 〈 +z | ħ/2 | +z 〉 = ħ/2
2. 〈 +z | i ħ / 2 | −z 〉 = 0
3. (-i ) 〈 −z | ħ/2 | +z 〉 = 0
4. (-i)(i) 〈 −z | i ħ/2 | −z 〉

Simplify each term:

Term4: (-i)(i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1. Also, 〈 −z | i * ħ/2 | −z 〉 = i * ħ / 2 * 1. Therefore term4 is 1 * i * ħ / 2 = i ħ /2

Thus, adding up all terms after scaling by 1/2:

(1/2 ) [ ħ/2 + 0 + 0 + i ħ / 2 ] = (1/2 )( ( ħ / 2 )(1 + i ) ) = ħ (1 + i ) / 4 

But wait, this seems complex. But ⟨ +y | S_z | −y ⟩ should be a complex number.

Wait, but calculating S_z's matrix elements in the y-basis:
- ⟨ +y | S_z | +y ⟩ = 0
- ⟨ −y | S_z |−y ⟩= 0 
- ⟨ +y | S_z |−y ⟩ = [ (1/2 ) times (ħ/2 + i (ħ/2 )) ] as above? Wait:

Wait, given in this calculation:

Let’s take the expression (1/2)[ ħ/2 + iħ/2 ]

Noting that ⟨ +y | S_z | − y ⟩ = (1/2) * ( ħ/2 + i ħ / 2 ). Wait, wait; actually, let's recast the fourth term properly.

Wait, in the fourth term, actually:

Original: (1/2)[ 〈 +z | (ħ/2) |+z〉 + 〈 +z | (i ( -ħ/2 )) |−z〉 plus other terms. ]

Hold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let's correct:

Wait our psi(t) is in terms of |+y> and |−y> states. When taking the inner product of ⟨ +y | S_z | −y⟩, we have components that may result in complex numbers. However, the expectation value we are to compute should be real, as ⟨ S_z ⟩ is observable.

But if there's an error here, perhaps I should use orthogonal methods.

Since S_z is diagonal in the z-basis:

Consider that |+y〉and |-y〉are each ( |+z〉 + i |−z〉)/sqrt{2} and ( |+z〉 - i |−z〉)/sqrt{2} respectively. Then, to obtain ( |+y〉, |-y〉) basis transformation to ( |+z〉,  |−z〉).

Using matrix notation. Let me represent |+y〉as a column vector:

In the z basis, [1, i ]^T /sqrt{2 }, and |-y〉as [1, -i ]^T /sqrt{2 }. Then, S_z matrix is ħ/2 [ [1,0 ], [0, -1 ] ]

To change basis to |+y〉and |-y〉, we can compute the transformed matrix.

Alternatively note that a general matrix element of S_z in the y-basis is given by [y_i | S_z | y_j )].

Given that, the full S_z matrix in the y-basis would be:

Row 1, Column 1: ⟨ +y | S_z | +y ⟩ }= 0
Row 1, Column 2: ⟨ +y | S_z | −y ⟩ }= (1/2)( ħ / 2 + i * ħ / 2 )= (1/2)*( ħ/2 (1 + i )) = ħ/4 (1 + i )

Similarly Row 2, Column 1: ⟨ −y | S_z | +y ⟩ }= complex conjugate of ⟨ +y | S_z | −y ⟩} = ħ /4 (1 - i )

Row 2, Column 2: 0.

But, wait, this seems inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe using Pauli matrices.

Alternatively, remembering that in the y eigenbasis, other spin components (x and z) will have some form.

Since sigma_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]] in the z basis. The transformation to the y basis is done by a unitary matrix corresponding to rotation?

Alternatively,  consider that:
The y eigenbasis is related to the z eigenbasis by a rotation of π/2 about the X-axis. The rotation operator is R_x(π/2) = e^{-i (\pi/2) S_x / ħ } 

For spin-1/2, S_x = ħ/2 sigma_x. Thus, R_x(theta) = e^{-i theta/2 sigma_x }, so R_x(π/2 ) = e^{- i π/4 sigma_x }.

Which is equal to cos(π/4) I - i sin( pi/4 ) sigma_x = [ sqrt(2)/2 ([[1,0], [0,1]] ) - i ( sqrt{2}/2 [[0,1],[1,0]] ) ] 

Therefore, R_x(π/2 ) = (1/sqrt{2}) [[1, -i ], [ -i, 1 ]] ... Wait, no. Wait:

Let me compute e^{-i theta/2 sigma_x }. Note that for any Pauli matrix. since sigma_x^2 = 1, so e^{i theta sigma_x } = I cos(theta ) + i sigma_x sin(theta ). Therefore, R_x( pi / 2 ) would be e^{-i (pi/4) sigma_x } = cos( pi/4 ) I -i sin( pi/4 ) sigma_x ) = sqrt(2)/2 ( I -i sigma_x )

Expressed:

sqrt(2)/2 [ [1, 0] [0,1] ] -i sqrt(2)/2 [ [0,1],[1,0] ]

= sqrt(2)/2 [ [1, -i], [-i, 1] ]

Therefore, the columns of R_x(pi/2) )^† (which transforms from z to y basis) aren't the standard |+y> vectors. Wait, actually in standard conventions, perhaps another way. Anyway, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

An alternative smart move: The time evolution induces a rotation.

Alternatively, note that in quantum mechanics, when you have Hamiltonian proportional to S_y (H = w S_y ), the time evolution is a rotation about the y-axis, which causes the spin component perpendicular to y to precess around y with frequency w. So if the spin starts along z, and in a field along y, the spin vector (expectation) rotates around y with frequency determined by the Hamiltonian coefficient.

But in our case, H = - gamma B S_y, so the angular frequency about the y-axis is w = dphi/dt = - gamma B. Wait:

Alternatively, Recall that the expectation value satisfies the equation d⟨S⟩/dt = ( 1/(iħ) )   ⟨[S, H] ⟩, and using the Ehrenfest theorem. So,

 d⟨S⟩_z  dt = (1/iħ ) ⟨ [ S_z, H ] ⟩

H= - gamma B S_y, so [ S_z, H ] = - gamma B [ S_z, S_y ] = - gamma B i ħ S_x

Thus,

 d⟨S_z⟩/dt = (1/iħ)( -i ħ gamma B ) ⟨ S_x ⟩ = gamma B ⟨ S_x → ( gamma B ) S_x expectation

Similarly,

 d⟨S_x⟩ /dt = (1/iħ)⟨ [S_x, H ] ⟩

[H S_x ] = - gamma B [ S_x, S_y ] = - gamma B ( i ħ S_z )

Thus,

d⟨S_x⟩ /dt = (1/iħ) ( - gamma B )( i ħ S_z ) ) ⟨S_z⟩ = ( - gamma B ) (-i^2 ) ) ⟨ S_z ⟩

Let me compute:

Wait,

[ S_x, H ] = [ S_x, -gamma B S_y ] = - gamma B [ S_x, S_y ] = - gamma B ( i ħ S_z )

Therefore,

d⟨S_x⟩/dt = (1/iħ)(- gamma B i ħ ⟨S_z⟩ ) ) = (1/iħ ) ( - gamma B i ħ ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ = gamma B ⟨ S_z ⟩ * ( - i^ 2 ) )

Wait, then:

Which is equivalent to:

gamma B ⟨ S_z⟩  * (   ( (-i ħ ) /i ħ ) 

Wait, does this compute general relations?

Wait, let's clarify:

Firstly, [S_x, S_y ] = i ħ S_z
Then [

For our case:

d⟨ S_z ⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨ [ S_z, H ] ⟩ = [ (- gamma B ) (i ħ ) / i ħ ) ] ⟨ S_x ⟩ = gamma B ⟨ S_x ⟩

Similarly, continuing:

d⟨S_x⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨ [ S_x, H ] ⟩ = (1/iħ)⟨ - gamma B (i ħ S_z ) ⟩ = (1/iħ ) ( - gamma B i ħ ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ = gamma B ⟨ S_z ⟩

Wait? If you compute:

(1/iħ)( - gamma B * i hbar ⟨ S_z ⟩ )

= ( - gamma B i hbar / i hbar ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ )

i / i is 1, hbar cancels, - gamma B⟨ S_z ⟩

Wait, so it's: (1/i ħ)( - gamma B i ħ ) ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ = ( ( - gamma B ) (i ħ / i ħ ) ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ = - gamma B ⟨ S_z ⟩

Wait Now, reconciling this... the equation is:

d⟨S_x⟩/dt = (1/(iħ))*(-gamma B i ħ ) ) ⟨Sz〉 = (-gamma B ) (i ħ)/i ħ )⟨Sz〉} = - gamma B ⟨ Sz 〉

Wait, let me do more carefully:

Calculation:

gamma = gyromagnetic ratio,

H = - gamma B S_y 

ABuse notation here: Then, [ S_x, H ] = - gamma B [ S_x, S_y ] = - gamma B i ħ S_z 

Then (1/i ħ) * [ comm ] = (1/(i ħ )) [ - gamma B i ħ ⟨ S_z ⟩ ]

= (1/i ħ ) ( - gamma B i ħ ) ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ 

s and then:

= ( - gamma B (i ħ / (i ħ )) ) ⟨ S_z ⟩ = - gamma B ⟨ S_z ⟩

Therefore, system of equations:

d⟨S_z〉/dt = gamma B ⟨ S_x 〉

d⟨S_x〉/dt = - gamma B ⟨ S_z 〉 

So the flow maps ⟨S_z〉and⟨S_x〉to their derivatives. So derivative of each variable orthogonal:

The same as:

d²⟨S_z〉 /dt² = gamma B d⟨ S_x ⟩/dt = gamma B ( - gamma B ⟨ S_z 〉 ) = - ( gamma B )² ⟨ S_z 〉 

Thus, the differential equation:

d2/dt2 ⟨ S_z 〉 + ( gamma B )² ⟨ S_z 〉=0

So this is SHM with angular frequency omega=gamma B. Therefore, expectation⟨S_z〉will oscillate like cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is omega=gamma B, corresponding to frequency f=(gamma B ) / (2 pi )

But the question states 'oscillation frequency', and towards the standard physics convention, we can refer in terms of angular frequency (often called frequency).If they want angular frequency, answer is gamma B. If the answer expects in Hz (oscillations per second), need to consider factors with 2 pi. But in QM contexts, "Larmor frequency" here is gamma B.

But check rigorously: 

Given the differential equation:

⟨ S_z(t) 〉= A cos( gamma B t ) + B sin( gamma B t )

Hence, oscillation frequency is omega=gamma B (angular frequency).Hence the answer is gamma B. Considering the units: gamma here has units= (frequency)/(field), B is field, hence gammaB with have freq<｜place▁holder▁no▁50｜>: confirming units make sense.

Yes, the alternated approach via Heisenberg equation puts it in to result SHM for the observable⟨S_z〉.

Thus, even though we had a back and forth calculation over different methods, merges to the same conclusion. And another sanity check: the Larmor precession frequency is omega=gamma B. But, since here the field is along Y (the initial field along Z was turned off), once we apply field along Y, precession should happen about Y-axis. So spin will precess around Y causing 〈S_z〉 and 〈S_x〉 to oscillate. Time period would be similar to Larmor precession, i.e., equation results in angular frequency 2pi*f = gamma B.

Given the problem says the average starts oscillating. The conventional frequency would be (gamma B)/2 pi but they might asking for the angular frequency. The problem just says "frequency", if unqualified usually means angular in theoreticql contexts. But question says "oscillating," but to check in old exams: example like spin precession frequency. Well, given the exponent in time is omega*t, coupling after answer.

In shown solution, conslusion: frequency is gamma*B. But wait, wait the Hamiltonian terms and the Heisenberg equations.

Maybe I should rederive or have a typo.

Given that 

Ah without excuse me resume:

From starting Hamiltonia: initial in z, turn off, then turn on along y direction. The new Hamiltonian is H=-gamma B S_y. The time evolution can be written as exp( -i H t / ħ ), Which depends, the energy levels. From hte Heisnberg equation if you track  〈S_z〉to see that it evolve sinusoidally at frequency gamma*B.

In another view, the Larmor frequency is omega_L = gamma B will be the frequency at which spin precesses about the applied field. But since the initial spin is along z, then switching the field to y, the spin precesses about y. In this case, precession about y-axis at angular frequency gamma*B. This causes 〈S_z〉to oscillate sinusoidally with the same frequency.

So my above analysis in Heisenberg picture gives this answer, thats the frequency must be gamma*B.

Hence, answer is nu = gamma*B / 2  or but not. Wait, the frequency is omega = gamma*B [ angular ]. For usual notion of oscillation frequency (“Hz” ), which is f = omega/(2 pi ), but the physical oscillation frequency from parameters would have angular frequency gamma*B. The question mentions, "oscillation frequency", seems the answer is omega= gamma B.

However, need to check original quantum mechanics.

Alternatively, revisiting a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field. Energy splitting E=-gamma B S_y, state expressed in y basis implying oscillations between the energy eigenstates superposition in phases. What's the difference in energy? E_+−E_- =-gamma B ( ħ/2 ) − gamma B ħ/2 } Probability coefficient differences / fase terms have exponent (-i E_+ t/ ħ + i E_- t/ ħ )=−i [ E_+ - E_- ] t/ ħ. Since E_+ - E_- = - gamma B ħ, then phase is stack in:

e^{ i gamma B t}

Thus period T=(2pi)/( gamma B ), so frequency f=gamma B/(2 ). Except actually:

The energy separation Δ E= ( E_+ - E_- )= -gamma B ħ. Thus, the frequency is Δ E / ħ = -gamma B

Without the sign, |Δ E | / ħ = gamma B. Therefore, the f= gamma B/( 2 pi ). Hmm. So it's related to photons frequency omega=E/ħ. Thus the phasors would oscillate as:

⟨ S_z(t) 〉= Re[ stuff e^{i (Δ E / ħ ) t } ] → the angular frequency is Δ E / ħ = gamma B

Specifically, using the states.

As we saw from state evolution:

psi(t) = [ |+y〉e^{i gamma B t /2 } + |− y〉e^{– i gamma B t /2 }]/ sqrt{2} }. Now, expanding this in terms of z:

But since |+y〉 = ( |+z〉+i |−z〉)/sqrt{2}, psi(t ) = [ ( |＋z 〉 + i |－z〉 ) e^{i gamma B t/2 } + ( |＋z 〉 – i ) |−z〉 ) e^{− i gamma B t/2 } ] / [ 2 ]

= [ |+z〉( e^{ i gamma B t/2 } + e^{-i gamma B t /2 }  ) + i |−z〉( e^{ i gamma B t /2 } – e^{-i gamma Bt /2 } ) ] / 2

= [ |+z〉* 2 cos( gamma Bt /2) + i |−z〉 * 2 i sin (gamma B t/2 ) ] / 2

= |+z〉 cos( gamma B t /2 ) + (i^2 ) |−z〉 sin (gamma B t/2 )

= |+z〉 cos( gamma B t /2 ) – |−z〉 sin (gamma B t /2 )

Therefore,

| psi(t)〉= cos( gamma B t /2 ) |+z〉- sin( gamma B t /2 ) |−z〉

Therefore, the state probabilities oscillation lead to:

〈 S_z 〉 = (ħ/2)( | c_1 |² - | c2 |² )= (ħ/2)[ cos²( gamma B t /2 ) – sin^2( gamma B t /2 ) ]= ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Which is obviously a cos that oscillates at frequency gamma B, since the argument of cos is gamma B t (as gamma B t’ argument.

Wait, wait, inserting the total time component,

Yes: cos squared(theta) - sin squared(theta) = cos{ 2 theta }

But in the above, for〈S_z〉it's (ℏ/2 ) cos{gamma B t}

Yes: Indeed,

gamma_bt_half = (gamma B t)/2,

So, cos²(gamma_bt_half ) - sin²(gamma_bt_half) = cos( gamma B t )

Thus,〈 S_z〉= ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

Hence the oscillations in Z component have angular frequency omega=gamma B

Thus, after analysis following multiple methods (Heisnberg、Schrodinger picture、differential equations of motion), I conclude oscillation frequency isgamma * B hence, in box form, \boxed{\gamma B}

The time history of S_z in such cases is determined by spin components precessing around Y.\n\nAlternatively, as derived through Heisenberg equations approach, circular oscillation with angular frequency omega = gamma*B. Therefore, frequency in omega is gamma B, linear frequency f = gamma B/2π. But typically, is the Larmor frequency given as γB/(2π), while angular frequency ω = γ × B. The question querying "oscillation frequency" normally references omega (angular frequency), unless stipulating Hertz (cycles per second). However, we need to verify what\'s standard.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the energy levels from H = - mu · B translate to -gamma B ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles. The associated energy difference is hf = gamma B ħ => f = gamma B / (2π), when restoring frequency from E = hf. But the frequency here refers to the precessional motion. Yes, Larmor precession frequency for a spin in a magnetic field is omega = gamma*B.\n\nGiven that, for a spin in a magnetic field, the precession angular frequency is omega = gamma*B. Thus, here, when the magnetic field is along +Y, the spin precesses about Y axis. The component along Z (and X) oscillates sinusoidally with frequency omega (i.e., angular frequency) gamma B. But when asked specifically for the oscillation frequency, they might need angular frequency or the ordinary frequency (Hz). The problem states "oscillation frequency", which in physics commonly refers to angular frequency omega, but sometimes to ordinary frequency. Need to check:\n\nThe original problem states:\n"The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?"\n\nThough in physics, oscillation frequency typically implies cycles per second (Hz), but given quantum mechanics expressions often involve angular frequencies, perhaps to express in terms of gamma and B. Let\'s re-examine the equations:\n\nFrom the Heisenberg equations, obtained:\n\nSolution: S_z(t) = S_z(0) cos(omega t) + S_x(0) sin(omega t),\n\nwhere omega = gamma B. The expectation value <S_z(t)> would be:\n\nhS_z(t)i = hpsi| S_z(t) |psii = hpsi| [S_z(0) cos(omega t) + S_x(0) sin(omega t)] |psii.\n\nHowever, the initial state is |+z>, so hS_x(0)i = 0 (since the expectation of S_x in |+z> is zero). Therefore, the expectation hS_z(t)i = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), since hS_z(0)i= ħ/2. Hence, the average <S_z> oscillates as cosine with angular frequency gamma * B.\n\nSo the oscillation frequency would be gamma B as angular frequency, or gamma B / (2 π) if in cycles per second. However, check the problem again.\n\nProblem mentions "What is its oscillation frequency?" In standard terms, physicists often use angular frequency (radians per second) for these types of problems, especially when dealing with expressions like frequencies in quantum mechanics where equations use omega. Given that, as we saw, the angular frequency in the solution is omega = gamma B, hence the answer is "gamma times B," with possible units of rad/s if using SI.\n\nAlternatively, in pure symbols, given gamma and B. However, sometimes questions ask for frequency and mean cycles per second, so gamma B / (2 pi). Let\'s be careful. Examples from textbooks.\n\nFor a spin in a magnetic field, the energy levels E = - gamma B S. Transition frequency between spin-up and spin-down in B: for spin-1/2, delta E = gamma B ħ, so f = delta E / h = gamma B / (2 pi). But here, precessional frequency is gamma B over 2 pi or equal to?\n\nWait, no. Precessional frequency (Larmor frequency) is omega = gamma B, angular frequency. For instance, for an electron, Larmor frequency is gamma_e * B, with gamma_e being the gyromagnetic ratio (for electron, about 28 GHz/T, implying gamma_e = 2 pi * 28 GHz/T ~ 176 rad/GHz ... no, wait, details maybe complicating).\n\nAlternatively, clarifying: our system after the field is applied along Y. The time evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian. Assuming that upon suddenly changing the field, the state |+z> is expressed in terms of Y eigenstates.\n\nSince eigenstates in Y are |+y> and |-y>, which are (|+z> + i |-z>)/√2 and (|+z> - i |-z>)/√2, respectively.\n\nBut my initial state |+z> can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>. Specifically,\n\n|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2. Then, under the Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the time evolution would exhibit phase factors. The energy levels are E_plus = - gamma B (ħ/2) for |+y> and E_minus = + gamma B (ħ/2) for |-y> (since H = - gamma B S_y, so eigenenergies -gamma B times S_y eigenvalue, which for |+y> is ħ/2, yielding E_plus = - gamma B (ħ/2), perhaps. Wait: H is direction and sign.\n\nHold on. The actual expression for H is given by H = - mu · B, where mu = gamma S. Original direction was +Z, then new direction +Y.\n\nSo H here is, for second field: H = - gamma S · B where B is along +Y, so write H = - gamma B S_y.\n\nNow, the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> with S_y |+y> = (ħ/2)|+y> and |-y> with S_y |-y> = - (ħ/2)|-y>. So the energy eigenvalues would be E_plus = - gamma B (ħ/2) and E_minus = + gamma B (ħ/2).\n\nHence, |+y> evolves as: exp(-i E_plus t / ħ ) |+y> = exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>,\n\nSimilarly, |-y> evolves as exp(-i E_minus t / ħ ) |-y> = exp( -i gamma B ( ħ / 2 ) t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>\n\nCoefficients for |+z> expressed as (|+y> + |-y>)/√2. Therefore, after time t:\n\n|psi(t)> = [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2 )\n\nReplace |+y> and |-y> by their expressions in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\n|+y> = ( |+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nSimilarly, |-y> ( |+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 ) ??? Wait some signs may differ.\n\nWait, the S_y eigenstates in terms of S_z basis: Let\'s verify.\n\nThe eigenstates of S_y for eigenvalues ±ħ/2 are:\n\n|+y> = ( |+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\n|−y> = ( |+z> − i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nTherefore, you can invert this, or see |+z> = ( |+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nLikewise, |-z> = ( -i |+y> + i |-y> ) / sqrt(2 )\n\nBut regardless, plugging back, the time-evolved state in terms of |+z> and |-z>:\n\nFrom |psi(t)>:\n\n[ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + i |−z> ) / sqrt(2 ) + exp( - i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> - i |−z> ) / sqrt(2 ) ] / sqrt(2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, denominator is sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n[ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + i |-z> ) + exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> - i |-z> ) ] /2\n\nNow factor terms with |+z> and |-z>:\n\nFor |+z>:\n\n[ exp(i gamma B t/2 ) + exp( - i gamma B t/2 ) ] / 2 * |+z> )\n\n= cos(gamma B t /2 ) |+z>\n\nFor |-z>:\n\ni [ exp(i gamma B t /2 ) - exp( - i gamma B t /2 ) ] / 2 * |-z>\n\n= i [ (2i sin(gamma B t /2 )) ] / 2 |-z>\n\n= - sin(gamma B t /2 ) |-z>\n\nThus, |psi(t)> = cos( (gamma B t)/2 ) |+z> - sin( (gamma B t)/2 ) |-z>\n\nThen computing <S_z>:\n\nSince S_z for |+z> = ħ/2, and for |-z> = - ħ/2, the expectation value is:\n\n< S_z >(t) = [ cos^2( gamma B t /2 ) * (ħ/2 ) + sin^2( gamma B t /2 )*(-ħ/2 ) + cross terms ]\n\nBut cross terms would be terms from |+z><-z| but actually in the expectation value calculation, as |psi(t)> is a linear combination:\n\na |+z> + b |-z>,\n\nthen < S_z > is |a|² (ħ/2) + |b|² (-ħ/2 ).\n\nObserving theta, indeed:\n\n|a|² = cos²( gamma B t /2 )\n\n|b|² = sin²( gamma B t /2 )\n\nThus,\n\n< S_z >(t) = (ħ/2)( cos²( gamma B t /2 ) - sin²( gamma B t /2 ) )\n\n= (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )\n\nHence, oscillation of < Sz > is indeed proportional to cos( gamma B t ), hence angular frequency gamma B. So frequency is gamma B/(2 pi) for cycles per second, but in physics, when we see cos(omega t ), omega is the angular frequency, so the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B. Therefore, since question says "oscillation frequency", the answer is gamma B, as it refers to the angular frequency.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm the standard terminology. The Larmor frequency is indeed omega_L = gamma B, the angular frequency. If referring to ordinary frequency, it would be f = omega / (2 pi). So, the answer\'s correct? Question might expect angular frequency. However, likely, considering the Hamiltonians and the time evolution here, I think the answer is gamma multiplied by B. Depending on how the question is phrased.\n\nLooking at the mathematical derivation above leading to <S_z>(t) ( (ħ/2) cos (gamma B t ). The argument inside the cosine, gamma B t, has frequency (every 2 pi):\n\nA full period is when gamma B T = 2 pi. Period T = 2 pi/(gamma B). So frequency f = 1/T = gamma B/(2 pi). Therefore, standard definitions here.\n\nBut internationally, when someone speaks of frequency in oscillation of expectation values— However, the answer here since in the oscillation, the angular frequency is omega = gamma B. The strict answer depends on the unit discussed. Since the problem uses expressions like "oscillation frequency", which can be both.

The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is determined by analyzing the time evolution of the spin state under the new Hamiltonian. When the magnetic field is switched from the +Z to the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes \( H = -\gamma B S_y \). Using either the Heisenberg picture or solving the Schrödinger equation for the spin state, we find that the expectation value of \( S_z \) oscillates sinusoidally.

The time evolution of the spin state reveals that the expectation value \( \langle S_z \rangle \) oscillates with a frequency corresponding to the angular frequency \( \omega = \gamma B \). This result stems from the commutation relations of the spin operators and the equations of motion derived from the Heisenberg picture. The oscillation in the z-component of the magnetic moment is thus characterized by the angular frequency \( \gamma B \).

\[
\boxed{\gamma B}

 However, when the direction of B field changes, spin precession occurs around B direction (precessing about +Y if the field is along +Y). The time history of S_z in such cases is determined by spin components precessing around Y.

Alternatively, as derived through Heisenberg equations approach, circular oscillation with angular frequency omega = gamma*B. Therefore, frequency in omega is gamma B, linear frequency f = gamma B/2π. But typically, is the Larmor frequency given as γB/(2π), while angular frequency ω = γ × B. The question querying "oscillation frequency" normally references omega (angular frequency), unless stipulating Hertz (cycles per second). However, we need to verify what's standard.

In quantum mechanics, the energy levels from H = - mu · B translate to -gamma B ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles. The associated energy difference is hf = gamma B ħ => f = gamma B / (2π), when restoring frequency from E = hf. But the frequency here refers to the precessional motion. Yes, Larmor precession frequency for a spin in a magnetic field is omega = gamma*B.

Given that, for a spin in a magnetic field, the precession angular frequency is omega = gamma*B. Thus, here, when the magnetic field is along +Y, the spin precesses about Y axis. The component along Z (and X) oscillates sinusoidally with frequency omega (i.e., angular frequency) gamma B. But when asked specifically for the oscillation frequency, they might need angular frequency or the ordinary frequency (Hz). The problem states "oscillation frequency", which in physics commonly refers to angular frequency omega, but sometimes to ordinary frequency. Need to check:

The original problem states:
"The average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?"

Though in physics, oscillation frequency typically implies cycles per second (Hz), but given quantum mechanics expressions often involve angular frequencies, perhaps to express in terms of gamma and B. Let's re-examine the equations:

From the Heisenberg equations, obtained:

Solution: S_z(t) = S_z(0) cos(omega t) + S_x(0) sin(omega t),

where omega = gamma B. The expectation value <S_z(t)> would be:

hS_z(t)i = hpsi| S_z(t) |psii = hpsi| [S_z(0) cos(omega t) + S_x(0) sin(omega t)] |psii.

However, the initial state is |+z>, so hS_x(0)i = 0 (since the expectation of S_x in |+z> is zero). Therefore, the expectation hS_z(t)i = (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t), since hS_z(0)i= ħ/2. Hence, the average <S_z> oscillates as cosine with angular frequency gamma * B.

So the oscillation frequency would be gamma B as angular frequency, or gamma B / (2 π) if in cycles per second. However, check the problem again.

Problem mentions "What is its oscillation frequency?" In standard terms, physicists often use angular frequency (radians per second) for these types of problems, especially when dealing with expressions like frequencies in quantum mechanics where equations use omega. Given that, as we saw, the angular frequency in the solution is omega = gamma B, hence the answer is "gamma times B," with possible units of rad/s if using SI.

Alternatively, in pure symbols, given gamma and B. However, sometimes questions ask for frequency and mean cycles per second, so gamma B / (2 pi). Let's be careful. Examples from textbooks.

For a spin in a magnetic field, the energy levels E = - gamma B S. Transition frequency between spin-up and spin-down in B: for spin-1/2, delta E = gamma B ħ, so f = delta E / h = gamma B / (2 pi). But here, precessional frequency is gamma B over 2 pi or equal to?

Wait, no. Precessional frequency (Larmor frequency) is omega = gamma B, angular frequency. For instance, for an electron, Larmor frequency is gamma_e * B, with gamma_e being the gyromagnetic ratio (for electron, about 28 GHz/T, implying gamma_e = 2 pi * 28 GHz/T ~ 176 rad/GHz ... no, wait, details maybe complicating).

Alternatively, clarifying: our system after the field is applied along Y. The time evolution is governed by the Hamiltonian. Assuming that upon suddenly changing the field, the state |+z> is expressed in terms of Y eigenstates.

Since eigenstates in Y are |+y> and |-y>, which are (|+z> + i |-z>)/√2 and (|+z> - i |-z>)/√2, respectively.

But my initial state |+z> can be written as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>. Specifically,

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2. Then, under the Hamiltonian H = - gamma B S_y, the time evolution would exhibit phase factors. The energy levels are E_plus = - gamma B (ħ/2) for |+y> and E_minus = + gamma B (ħ/2) for |-y> (since H = - gamma B S_y, so eigenenergies -gamma B times S_y eigenvalue, which for |+y> is ħ/2, yielding E_plus = - gamma B (ħ/2), perhaps. Wait: H is direction and sign.

Hold on. The actual expression for H is given by H = - mu · B, where mu = gamma S. Original direction was +Z, then new direction +Y.

So H here is, for second field: H = - gamma S · B where B is along +Y, so write H = - gamma B S_y.

Now, the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> with S_y |+y> = (ħ/2)|+y> and |-y> with S_y |-y> = - (ħ/2)|-y>. So the energy eigenvalues would be E_plus = - gamma B (ħ/2) and E_minus = + gamma B (ħ/2).

Hence, |+y> evolves as: exp(-i E_plus t / ħ ) |+y> = exp(i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y>,

Similarly, |-y> evolves as exp(-i E_minus t / ħ ) |-y> = exp( -i gamma B ( ħ / 2 ) t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>

Coefficients for |+z> expressed as (|+y> + |-y>)/√2. Therefore, after time t:

|psi(t)> = [ exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2 )

Replace |+y> and |-y> by their expressions in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

|+y> = ( |+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, |-y> ( |+z> - i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 ) ??? Wait some signs may differ.

Wait, the S_y eigenstates in terms of S_z basis: Let's verify.

The eigenstates of S_y for eigenvalues ±ħ/2 are:

|+y> = ( |+z> + i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 )

|−y> = ( |+z> − i |-z> ) / sqrt(2 )

Therefore, you can invert this, or see |+z> = ( |+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2 )

Likewise, |-z> = ( -i |+y> + i |-y> ) / sqrt(2 )

But regardless, plugging back, the time-evolved state in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

From |psi(t)>:

[ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + i |−z> ) / sqrt(2 ) + exp( - i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> - i |−z> ) / sqrt(2 ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Simplify:

First, denominator is sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2.

Combine terms:

[ exp(i gamma B t/2) (|+z> + i |-z> ) + exp(-i gamma B t/2 ) (|+z> - i |-z> ) ] /2

Now factor terms with |+z> and |-z>:

For |+z>:

[ exp(i gamma B t/2 ) + exp( - i gamma B t/2 ) ] / 2 * |+z> )

= cos(gamma B t /2 ) |+z>

For |-z>:

i [ exp(i gamma B t /2 ) - exp( - i gamma B t /2 ) ] / 2 * |-z>

= i [ (2i sin(gamma B t /2 )) ] / 2 |-z>

= - sin(gamma B t /2 ) |-z>

Thus, |psi(t)> = cos( (gamma B t)/2 ) |+z> - sin( (gamma B t)/2 ) |-z>

Then computing <S_z>:

Since S_z for |+z> = ħ/2, and for |-z> = - ħ/2, the expectation value is:

< S_z >(t) = [ cos^2( gamma B t /2 ) * (ħ/2 ) + sin^2( gamma B t /2 )*(-ħ/2 ) + cross terms ]

But cross terms would be terms from |+z><-z| but actually in the expectation value calculation, as |psi(t)> is a linear combination:

a |+z> + b |-z>,

then < S_z > is |a|² (ħ/2) + |b|² (-ħ/2 ).

Observing theta, indeed:

|a|² = cos²( gamma B t /2 )

|b|² = sin²( gamma B t /2 )

Thus,

< S_z >(t) = (ħ/2)( cos²( gamma B t /2 ) - sin²( gamma B t /2 ) )

= (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Hence, oscillation of < Sz > is indeed proportional to cos( gamma B t ), hence angular frequency gamma B. So frequency is gamma B/(2 pi) for cycles per second, but in physics, when we see cos(omega t ), omega is the angular frequency, so the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B. Therefore, since question says "oscillation frequency", the answer is gamma B, as it refers to the angular frequency.

Alternatively, to confirm the standard terminology. The Larmor frequency is indeed omega_L = gamma B, the angular frequency. If referring to ordinary frequency, it would be f = omega / (2 pi). So, the answer's correct? Question might expect angular frequency. However, likely, considering the Hamiltonians and the time evolution here, I think the answer is gamma multiplied by B. Depending on how the question is phrased.

Looking at the mathematical derivation above leading to <S_z>(t) ( (ħ/2) cos (gamma B t ). The argument inside the cosine, gamma B t, has frequency (every 2 pi):

A full period is when gamma B T = 2 pi. Period T = 2 pi/(gamma B). So frequency f = 1/T = gamma B/(2 pi). Therefore, standard definitions here.

But internationally, when someone speaks of frequency in oscillation of expectation values— However, the answer here since in the oscillation, the angular frequency is omega = gamma B. The strict answer depends on the unit discussed. Since the problem uses expressions like "oscillation frequency", which can be both. But the solution from Heisenberg equations introduced angular frequency. Let me think.

Upon evaluating the expressions, the argument's rate is gamma*B. So when you see in Cos ( gamma B t ), the angular frequency is Gamma B, where units come from gamma B.

gamma [gyromagnetic ratio] is defined as the ratio of magnetic moment to angular momentum, which has dimensions of [frequency] divided by [magnetic field]. The unit for gamma is (rad/s)/(T). Therefore, gamma times B (in tesla) gives rad/s, which is the angular frequency. Therefore, "oscillation frequency" unit from this is rad/s aka angular frequency. For example, if problem states "frequency" and solution has gamma B, which is angular frequency. So.

Yeah, in physics terminology, when you have oscillations in the form cos(omega t ), omega is angular frequency and if someone asks for frequency, they would mean omega/(2 pi) and answer would be different, but in quantum mechanics discussions, often refer to transition frequencies in angular terms. Need to check:

Suppose the answer being accepted as gamma*B (angular frequency); but let's also note that when you query about oscillation frequency in Si units and dynamics, under standard terminology, physicists often use angular frequency when mentioning formula. Hence, the main audience on this problem (someone studying for a quantum mechanics course, possibly) is probably expected to provide the angular frequency.

Hence, I'll conclude that the oscillation frequency is omega = gamma B, so the answer is gamma B. Hence, boxed answer is \boxed{\gamma B}
