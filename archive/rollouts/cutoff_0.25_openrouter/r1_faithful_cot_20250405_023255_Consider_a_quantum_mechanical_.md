To determine the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \):

1. **Energy Levels**: The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by \( E = \hbar \omega (N + \frac{3}{2}) \), where \( N \) is a non-negative integer representing the sum of the quantum numbers in the Cartesian directions \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \). The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state to \( N = 1 \), the second excited state to \( N = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( N = 3 \).

2. **Third Excited State Energy**: For \( N = 3 \), the energy is calculated as:
   \[
   E = \hbar \omega \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
   \]

3. **Degeneracy (Number of Eigenfunctions)**: The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given \( N \) is the number of ways to distribute \( N \) quanta among the three directions \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). For \( N = 3 \), we consider all combinations of non-negative integers \( (n_x, n_y, n_z) \) such that \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \):
   - Permutations of \( (3, 0, 0) \): 3 ways
   - Permutations of \( (2, 1, 0) \): 6 ways
   - Permutations of \( (1, 1, 1) \): 1 way

   Summing these, we get \( 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 \) eigenfunctions.

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{2}\hbar \omega}\) and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is \(\boxed{10}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the third excited state of a quantum harmonic oscillator in three dimensions, and also the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm. Let me remember... The problem says it's an isotropic potential, meaning it's the same in all directions, right? The potential is (1/2)mω²r², which is a 3D harmonic oscillator.

First, in three dimensions, the energy levels for an isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by a formula involving the quantum numbers. I think it's something like E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is a combination of the radial and angular quantum numbers. Wait, no, maybe it's E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) where n_x, n_y, n_z are the quantum numbers for each Cartesian direction. So for each direction, the energy is (n + 1/2)ħω, then summed over the three directions gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω.

But the problem might also consider the energy levels in terms of the principal quantum number. Let me think: in 3D, the isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels that can be written as E = ħω(2n_r + l + 3/2), where n_r is the radial quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number. Wait, but in Cartesian coordinates, each direction is independent, so the total energy is the sum of energies from each direction. So the sum n_x + n_y + n_z = N, where N is a non-negative integer, and then the total energy is (N + 3/2)ħω. Then each energy level corresponds to a certain N.

In that case, the ground state is N=0: energy (3/2)ħω. First excited state N=1: (1 + 3/2)ħω = (5/2)ħω. Second excited state N=2: (2 + 3/2)ħω = (7/2)ħω. Third excited state would be N=3: (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, the ground state is the lowest possible energy. Then the first excited state is the next one. For N=0, it's the ground state. For each N, the possible states are those with different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z such that their sum is N. So for N=0, the only combination is (0,0,0), so ground state. For N=1, possible values where n_x + n_y + n_z = 1: permutations of (1,0,0). So those are three states. Then N=2 has permutations of (2,0,0) and (1,1,0). There are three permutations for (2,0,0) and three permutations for (1,1,0), so total six states. Then N=3 would be the third excited state, right? So N=3 would correspond to sum N=3, which would give the third excited state. But energy is (N + 3/2)ħω, so for N=3: (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.

Alternatively, if the problem is considering the energy levels in terms of the number of nodes in the radial wavefunction (radial quantum number), but since it's isotropic, maybe in spherical coordinates, the energy depends on the principal quantum number. Wait, the energy for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is also given in terms of the quantum numbers n_r and l as E = ħω(2n_r + l + 3/2). Then, it's equal to ħω(N + 3/2) where N = 2n_r + l. So here, N must be a non-negative integer, and for each N, l can take values such that N - l is even and non-negative. Therefore, l can be N, N-2, N-4,..., down to 0 or 1 depending on parity. So for the same N, multiple values of l are possible.

Wait, so for example, N=0: l=0, so only s-orbitals. N=1: since N=1, l must be 1 (1=2n_r + l, so with n_r integer >=0, only possible if n_r=0, l=1). So l=1, which is p-orbital. Then for N=2: 2=2n_r + l. Possible n_r=0, l=2 or n_r=1, l=0. So l=2 (d) and l=0 (s). For N=3: 2n_r + l =3. So l can be 3 (n_r=0) or 1 (n_r=1). So l=3 (f) and l=1 (p). So the energies are same for the same N, but different l. So the number of states would be summing over all possible l and their multiplicity.

But the previous Cartesian approach gave that for N=3 (third excited state), the number of states would be the number of ways to have n_x + n_y + n_z =3. Which is like permutations of (3,0,0), (2,1,0), (1,1,1). Let's compute that. For (3,0,0): three permutations. For (2,1,0): there are 3! =6 permutations. For (1,1,1): only one permutation. So total: 3 + 6 +1=10 states. So the number of states for N=3 is 10.

But in the spherical coordinates approach, for each N=0,1,2,3..., the states can have different angular momentum quantum numbers. For N=3, possible l=1 and 3. Then, for l=3: the multiplicity is (2l +1)=7 states (m=-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3). For l=1: multiplicity 3 (m=-1,0,1). So total states: 7 + 3=10. Which matches the Cartesian approach.

Therefore, both methods agree: for each N, number of states is (N +1)(N +2)/2? Wait, if N=3: (3+1)(3+2)/2=4*5/2=10. Yes. So the total number of states for a given N is (N+1)(N+2)/2. So in this case, if the third excited state corresponds to N=3, because ground state is N=0 (first), first excited state N=1 (second), second N=2 (third), third N=3 (fourth). Wait, actually, when talking about excited states: Ground state is 0th energy level; first excited state is N=1, second excited state N=2, third excited state N=3.

So in the problem statement, the third excited state is N=3, energy E=(3 + 3/2)ħω= (9/2)ħω. And the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is the number of states with energy E, which in Cartesian coordinates is the number of integer triples (n_x,n_y,n_z) with n_x + n_y + n_z =3. Which we found as 10. Alternatively, using the angular momentum addition approach, the number is 10.

Hence, energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

So the answer should be Energy = (9/2)ħω, and 10 eigenfunctions.

But let me just confirm the indexing here. If N=0 is the ground state, then indeed third excited would be N=3, since:

Ground state (0): N=0; first excited: N=1; second excited: N=2; third excited: N=3. Yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, yes. The energy is (9/2)ħω, and degeneracy (number of states) is 10.

**Final Answer**
The energy of the third excited state is \boxed{\frac{9}{2}\hbar \omega}, and there are \boxed{10} linearly independent eigenfunctions.

I'm working to understand the energy of the third excited state in a three-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, as well as determining how many linearly independent eigenfunctions exist for that energy level. Let me recall... The problem indicates we're dealing with an isotropic potential, which means it's uniform in all directions. The potential is expressed as (1/2)mω²r², representing a 3D harmonic oscillator.

Initially, for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels follow a formula involving quantum numbers. I believe it might be E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n relates to the combination of radial and angular quantum numbers. Actually, perhaps it's E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), with n_x, n_y, and n_z representing the quantum numbers for each Cartesian direction. So each direction contributes (n + 1/2)ħω to the energy, and summing across all three directions yields (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω.

The problem might alternatively frame energy levels using the principal quantum number. In three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels that can be expressed as E = ħω(2n_r + l + 3/2), where n_r is the radial quantum number and l represents the angular momentum quantum number. However, in Cartesian coordinates, each direction operates independently, making the total energy the sum of energies from each direction. This means n_x + n_y + n_z = N, with N being a non-negative integer, resulting in a total energy of (N + 3/2)ħω. Therefore, each energy level corresponds to a specific value of N.

I'm trying to determine the energy of the third excited state of a quantum harmonic oscillator in three dimensions and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions associated with that energy level. The problem specifies that the potential is isotropic, meaning it is consistent in all directions. The given potential is (1/2)mω²r², representing a 3D harmonic oscillator.

In three dimensions, the energy levels of an isotropic harmonic oscillator are determined by a formula involving quantum numbers. I believe it is E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n represents a combination of radial and angular quantum numbers.

For each individual direction, the energy is (n + 1/2)ħω, and when summed across the three directions, it becomes (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω.

The problem might also describe the energy levels in terms of the principal quantum number. In 3D, the isotropic harmonic oscillator has energy levels expressed as E = ħω(2n_r + l + 3/2), where n_r is the radial quantum number, and l is the angular momentum quantum number.

Therefore, the sum n_x + n_y + n_z equals N, a non-negative integer, and the total energy is given by (N + 3/2)ħω. Each energy level corresponds to a specific value of N.

Let\'s check this.\n\nBut wait, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels can be degenerate. The degeneracy (number of states) for a given N is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N. This is a combinatorics problem: the number of ways to put N indistinct balls into 3 distinct boxes. The formula is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (N+2 choose 2).

So in spherical terms, those six states consist of five with l=2 and one with l=0. So again, same count.\n\nFor N=3, Cartesian would give (3 +2)!/(3!2!) =10. In spherical coordinates: possible l=3 (n_r=0), then l=1 (n_r=1). Because 2n_r + l =3. For l=3: 2*0+3=3, and (2*1)+1=3. For l=1, n_r=(3 -1)/2=1. Then l=3 gives (2*3 +1)=7 states and l=1 gives (2*1 +1)=3 states. 7+3=10. Exactly the Cartesian count. So the two treatments agree. The conclusion is, the total number of states is 10.\n\nTherefore, given that the third excited state corresponds to N=3 (since N=0 is ground, N=1 first excited, N=2 second, and N=3 third excited state), the energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω, and the number of independent eigenfunctions is the degeneracy which is 10.\n\nBut let me just check if there\'s a discrepancy in terminology if the third excited state is N=3.\n\nIn some contexts, people label energy levels in terms of nodes or something else, but I think for the harmonic oscillator in 3D, since each higher N increases by 1 in the number of quanta, the correspondence is as above.\n\nAlternatively, if you considered the eigenstates sorted by energy, then E_0 = 3/2 ħω, then E_1=5/2 ħω, E_2=7/2 ħω, E_3=9/2 ħω, so the states are labeled E_0, E_1, E_2, E_3. Then the third excited state is E_3. That makes sense.\n\nSo the answer is energy (9/2)ħω and degeneracy 10.

To determine the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \):

1. **Energy Levels**: The energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by \( E = \hbar \omega (N + \frac{3}{2}) \), where \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \) and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. The quantum number \( N \) determines the energy level.

2. **Third Excited State**: The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state to \( N = 1 \), the second excited state to \( N = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( N = 3 \).

3. **Energy Calculation**: For \( N = 3 \), the energy is:
   \[
   E = \hbar \omega \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
   \]

4. **Degeneracy (Number of Linearly Independent Eigenfunctions)**: The degeneracy of the energy level \( N \) is the number of ways to distribute \( N \) quanta among the three dimensions, which is given by the combinatorial formula \( \binom{N + 2}{2} \). For \( N = 3 \):
   \[
   \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10
   \]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \(\boxed{\dfrac{9}{2} \hbar \omega}\) and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is \(\boxed{10}\).

 case, the ground state would be N=0 (so n_x = n_y = n_z = 0), giving E = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω. Then the first excited state would be N=1, which can be achieved in three different ways: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So three states. Then the second excited state would be N=2: combinations like (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). So that's 6 states. The third excited state should then be N=3, right? Because the ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second excited N=2, third excited N=3. So the energy would be (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.

Alternatively, sometimes people refer to the ground state as the first state, so maybe N=0 is the first state, and third excited would be N=3? Wait, but in standard terminology, the "excited states" start counting from the first level above the ground state. So yes, ground state is the 0th, then first excited, second, third, which correspond to N=1, 2, 3. Wait, but if you think of energy levels in terms of N: E = (N + 3/2)ħω where N=0,1,2,...

So then the third excited state is when N=3. So energy would be (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω. Hmm. Let's check this.

But wait, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels can be degenerate. The degeneracy (number of states) for a given N is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N. This is a combinatorics problem: the number of ways to put N indistinct balls into 3 distinct boxes. The formula is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) = (N+2 choose 2). So for N=3 that would be (3+2)=5, then choose 2: 5!/(2!3!) = 10. So 10 states. So the third excited state (N=3) would have 10 independent eigenfunctions.

But let me double-check the numbering of the states. Ground state is N=0 (correct), first excited N=1 (energy 5/2 ħω), then second excited N=2 (energy 7/2 ħω), third excited N=3 (energy 9/2 ħω). So answer would be E = (9/2)ħω and degeneracy 10.

Wait, but there's another representation in spherical coordinates, where energy levels are given by E = ħω(2n_r + l + 3/2). Then in that case, since angular momentum is involved, but because it's isotropic, energy only depends on the sum 2n_r + l. For example, for different states with different l but same 2n_r + l can have same energy.

For example, when the energy level is E = (N + 3/2)ħω where N = 2n_r + l.

Therefore, the same N can be represented by multiple pairs (n_r, l) which satisfy 2n_r + l = N, so for fixed N, l can take values N, N-2, N-4,... down to 0 or 1, depending on N.

Therefore, for each N, the possible angular momentum quantum numbers l are N, N-2, ...,0 or 1. Then for each l, the number of states would be multiplicity (2l +1), due to the m values.

Therefore, the total number of states (degeneracy) for energy E = (N + 3/2)ħω is the sum over all possible l (for that N) of (2l +1).

But in the Cartesian case, degeneracy was (N + 2)(N +1)/2, which is different.

Wait, so I must check whether these two perspectives agree.

Wait, for example, in Cartesian coordinates:

For N=0: only (0,0,0). So 1 state. So that corresponds to l=0 (spherical), n_r=0. Since 2n_r + l =0, so yes. 2*0 +0=0. So spherical coordinates and Cartesian coordinates would agree for the ground state.

For N=1: Cartesian gives three states (1,0,0), etc. In spherical coordinates, N=1, so 2n_r + l =1. So possible l=1 (n_r=0). Then degeneracy would be (2*1 +1)=3. So 3 states. Correct. So both systems agree here.

For N=2. Cartesian gives 6 states. In spherical terms: 2n_r + l =2. Then l can be 2 (n_r=0), l=0 (n_r=1). Then total states are (2*2 +1)=5 for l=2, and (2*0 +1)=1 for l=0, total 6. Correct. So sum of 5+1=6. So in spherical terms, those six states consist of five with l=2 and one with l=0. So again, same count.

For N=3, Cartesian would give (3 +2)!/(3!2!) =10. In spherical coordinates: possible l=3 (n_r=0), then l=1 (n_r=1). Because 2n_r + l =3. For l=3: 2*0+3=3, and (2*1)+1=3. For l=1, n_r=(3 -1)/2=1. Then l=3 gives (2*3 +1)=7 states and l=1 gives (2*1 +1)=3 states. 7+3=10. Exactly the Cartesian count. So the two treatments agree. The conclusion is, the total number of states is 10.

Therefore, given that the third excited state corresponds to N=3 (since N=0 is ground, N=1 first excited, N=2 second, and N=3 third excited state), the energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω, and the number of independent eigenfunctions is the degeneracy which is 10.

But let me just check if there's a discrepancy in terminology if the third excited state is N=3.

In some contexts, people label energy levels in terms of nodes or something else, but I think for the harmonic oscillator in 3D, since each higher N increases by 1 in the number of quanta, the correspondence is as above.

Alternatively, if you considered the eigenstates sorted by energy, then E_0 = 3/2 ħω, then E_1=5/2 ħω, E_2=7/2 ħω, E_3=9/2 ħω, so the states are labeled E_0, E_1, E_2, E_3. Then the third excited state is E_3. That makes sense.

So the answer is energy (9/2)ħω and degeneracy 10. That seems right.

However, maybe there's a student error where someone confuses the order.

Alternatively, in 1D harmonic oscillator, each energy level is E_n = (n + 1/2)ħω, and the excited states are each just by n. But in 3D, the total energy E is by N, with E = (N + 3/2)ħω where N can be 0,1,2,...

So excited state 3 would be N=3. So I think that's right.

Hence, energy is 9/2 ħω, number of states is 10.

**Final Answer**
The energy of the third excited state is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{2} \hbar \omega} and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions is \boxed{10}.

For the ground state, N = 0, which gives E_0 = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω. The first excited state would be N = 1, then N = 2 for the second excited, and N = 3 for the third excited state. Wait – hold on. Typically, the ground state is the lowest energy. The first excited state is the next possible energy level. Wait, but considering how energy is determined by N. So the quantum number N is the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z. So in 3D, for each N, different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z sum up to N, which gives the same energy E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω.\n\nHowever, need to confirm the ordering. For the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are evenly spaced with spacing ħω. But each successive N gives a new energy level. For a given N, the energy is E = (N + 3/2)ħω. Then the ground state corresponds to N = 0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3.\n\nBut wait let me make sure. Let us take the ground state: N = 0, all n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. First excited state is N = 1: e.g., (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). Thus energy E = (1 + 3/2)ħω = 5/2 ħω. Then the second excited would be N =2, that is combinations where n_x + n_y + n_z = 2 and so on. Therefore, the third excited state would correspond to N=3. Hence, the energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω. So energy is 9/2 ħω. Then, number of eigenfunctions? Well, how many eigenfunctions correspond to N=3? Possibilities: They distribute 3 quanta in 3 dimensions. The number is given by the combination with repetition, which is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1 ) = (5 choose 2) = 10. Alternatively, the number of ways to arrange three indistinct quanta in three distinct oscillators is (3 + 3 -1)!/(3!(3 -1)!) ) No, formula for number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x +n_y +n_z = N is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1 ) which is (N + 2 choose 2). Plugging N=3: (3 +2 choose 2) = 5C2 = 10. So that would imply that the degeneracy is 10. So the third excited state (N=3) has energy 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10. \n\nBut let\'s confirm the definition of "excited states". Ground state is the lowest energy, which here is 3/2 ħω. Next, first excited state is next level, which is 5/2 ħω (N=1) with degeneracy 3. Then the second is 7/2 ħω (N=2), degeneracy 6? Wait, if N=2, then the number of states is (2 + 2) choose 2 = 4C2=6, yes that\'s right. Then third excited state is N=3, E=9/2 ħω with 10 states. So per that, the third excited state indeed corresponds to N=3.\n\nAlternatively, by the standard hydrogen atom, excited states are ordinal: n-th excited state referring to n=1 then 2, etc. Here, since the first energy level above the ground is N=1. So each N corresponds to different energy levels, and for each, the Rung counts the number. Then the nth excited state would be N= n. But assuming the question follows that. Thus, third excited is N=3, hence energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω=9/2 ħω, which would often be written as E= (9/2)ħω. Then the number of eigenfunctions is the degneracy, which is (3 +3 -1 choose3 -1 )=10, as calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the number of states for a given N (since the energy levels are labeled by N) is the same combination problem. Number of states for a given N is number of non-negative integers (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that n_x + n_y + n_z = N. Thus, in combinatorics, this is equivalent to the stars and bars theorem. The formula is (N + d -1 choose d -1) where d is the dimension. Here, d=3, hence (N + 2 choose 2). So for N=3: (3 + 2) choose 2 is 5 choose 2 = 10. So, yes, 10 states. Therefore, the answer should be 9/2 ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. But let me just check. For example, when N=0, yes, all zeros, 1 state. For N=1, three states (each coordinate given a single quantum). N=2: six states (possible triples (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)). So that depends on whether order matters; of the arrangements? Yes, because each direction is distinct. Hence, that is correct. For N=2: triple with two quanta in each possible direction, and different permutations. 3 permutations for two of the same and one different, and then three cases here, but actually E.g., (2,0,0), (0,2,0), etc. are three states. And (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), another three, totaling 6; that\'s right, which is indeed 6. For N=3, let\'s list them: Quantities adding to 3. We can have:\n\n- 3 in one coordinate: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) -> 3 states.\n\n- 2 in one, 1 in another: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). So per number of coordinates for choosing which has 2, which has 1: For each pair of coordinates, 2 in one and 1 in the other. E.g., Between x and y, x and z, y and z. Each pair contributes two permutations (which one has 2 and which has 1). So 3 pairs and 2 each gives 6.\n\n- All three different with 1 in each. Wait, but 1+1+1 =3? No, that would be N=3 with (1,1,1) but 1+1+1=3. So (1,1,1). So another one state. Wait, but 1+1+1=3, so that\'s also permitted. So total is 3 + 6 +1=10 states.\n\nWait, but wait, (1,1,1) is possible? Then yes, but does that sum up to 3? Yes. 1+1+1=3. But that seems like perhaps if N=3, you can have (n_x, n_y, n_z)= (3,0,0), permutations, then (2,1,0) permutations, and (1,1,1). So summing x, n_x etc. And these would all add up to three. So (1,1,1) describes a state where each coordinate has one quantum. So that\'s allowed, yes.\n\nBut hang on, in one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, each direction is quantized. The n_x, n_y, n_z applies to each direction. The 3D harmonic oscillator can have even eigenfunctions where each direction is set to its own n_x etc. So in total, in 3D, n_x +n_y +n_z = N. So yes, n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. Therefore, for N=3, the possible combinations are:\n\nType 1: All three quanta in one direction. (3,0,0) and permutations, gives 3 states.\n\nType 2: Two quanta in one direction and 1 in another. (2,1,0) permutations. Number here: for choosing which direction is 2, which is 1, and which is 0.\n\nThere are 3 choices for the direction to assign 2 quanta, then 2 choices left for the direction with 1, and the last is 0. So 3*2=6, so 6 states.\n\nType 3: One quantum each in all three directions. So (1,1,1). Since all directions must be 1, this configuration is uniquely defined. Thus, only 1 state.\n\nTherefore, 3 +6+1=10. Hence, 10 states, each with E=(3 +3/2)ħω=9/2 ħω.\n\nTherefore, the third excited state is 9/2 ħω, with 10 degenerate eigenfunctions.\n\nAlternative Thought: Alternatively, if considering the radial quantum number and angular momentum, but since the assignment stated that in the spherical polar coordinate. However, in Cartesian coordinates, as we\'ve previously explored, it\'s straightforward, but how does this translate when moving to spherical coordinates? In three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated either in Cartesian or in spherical coordinates, with eigenstates characterized by quantum numbers n_r (radial) and l (angular momentum), and the energy depends on n_r and l as E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ħω. But Cartesian and spherical approaches should agree, as they are just different coordinate systems. So how does this connection work.\n\nAlternatively, in spherical coordinates, remember that the energy levels degenaracy (which we are calculating in Cartesian by assigning different (n_x, n_y, n_z)) can also be considered by collective quantum number usually N =2 n_r + l. So in that case, under that understanding, E = (N + 3/2) ħω. Here, different combination of n_r and l can contribute to the same N, so same energy. Let\'s check. Let’s think in terms of spherical coordinates. So energy E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ħω = (N + 3/2)ħω where N=2n_r + l. Then for a given E, which requires N being even or odd depending on combinations.\n\nBut in the Cartesian sense, the total energy comes from N = n_x +n_y +n_z. Therefore, in three dimensions, can we have each energy level E_N expressed through either approach. But |it is essential to note. The two methods (Cartesian and Spherical) need to yield the same energy spectrum, so they must reconcile their quantum numbers for the same energy.\n\nLet me consider that notion. Suppose in spherical coordinates, the energy is given by E = (2n_r + l + 3/2) ħω, whereas in Cartesian coordinates E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.\n\nTherefore comparing them:\n\nIn Cartesian, energies are spaced by 1 in terms of N (i.e., n_x + n_y + n_z). So 0,1,2,3,...\n\nIn spherical, energies depend on pairs (n_r, l), with 2n_r + l equalling N. So the same energy is parametrized by different (n_r, l), giving l from 0 what’s allowed?\n\nFor example:\n\nSuppose N=0: 2n_r + l =0. Therefore, n_r=0, l=0.\n\nN=1: 2n_r + l=1. Possible solutions: n_r =0, l=1; or perhaps if negative numbers are allowed, but n_r must be non-negative integers and l non-negative integers, so here n_r=0, l=1 is the only possible value.\n\nBut in Cartesian, for N=1 (nX +nY +nZ=1), which has degeneracy 3. While in spherical coordinates, perhaps l=1 (want that?), so how many states are that?\n\nFor N=1=2n_r + l implies n_r=0, l=1, so angular momentum l=1. The number of states for l=1 is multiplicity 2l+1=3. Therefore it\'s three states, same as Cartesian. So something is consistent.\n\nThen N=2 (so 2n_r + l =2). Then possibilities:\n\nn_r=0, l=2.\n\nn_r=1, l=0.\n\nSo two possibilities. For each (n_r, l), we have 2l+1 states: number of states when N=2 would be for l=2: 5 states (2*2+1=5), and for l=0:1 state (n_r=1, l=0).\n\nBut Cartesian N=2 accounts for (n_x +n_y +n_z=2), which is 6 states. But in spherical, these are 6 states made up of l=2, m=-2,-1,0,1,2 (5 states) and l=0 (1 state). Together, 5+1=6. Exactly matches with Cartesian; the same applies with energy. Thus E=(2 +3/2)ħω=7/2 ħω? Wait, oh in Cartesian energy is (N +3/2) so N=2 here. But per equations in spherical coordinates, same N but with E=(2n_r + l +3/2)=? If n_r=0, l=2, then 0 + 2 + 3/2= (5/2).\n\nNo, conflict arises. Wait, seems different.\n\nWait, either mistake is present. Let me re-express: Need to check the correspondence.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from using the same symbol N in Cartesian and spherical, but perhaps here they differ.\n\nWait Can\'t be. Let me think again.\n\nIn Cartesian: E = (n_x +n_y +n_z +3/2)ℏω.\n\nSpherical coch.: E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ℏω.\n\nIn order for energy levels to match, (N_{cart} +3/2)ℏω must equate with (2n_r + l + 3/2)ℏω.\n\nHence, equating N_{cart} = 2n_r + l. Therefore, for a given N_spherical (where E = (N +3/2…) and similar.\n\nSo, in the two pictures—Cartesian and spherical—for the same energy, different quantum numbers. For instance, for Cart. N: 0: (3/2);\n\nFor Cart N=1: (5/2);\n\nCart N=2:7/2;\n\n\nSpherical:\n\nEnergy (same as Cart\'s N) would correspond to:\n\nEnergy = (2n_r + l +3/2).\n\nSo, algebraic needs 2n_r +l = N_cart.\n\nSo for N_cart=0: 2n_r + l=0 ⇒n_r=0, l=0. Then (N=0, E=3/2) in cart corresponds to (n_r=0, l=0, m=0) in spherical.\n\nFor N_cart=1⇒ 2n_r + l=1; only possible if n_r=0, l=1. Then the energy is (1+3/2)ℏω=5/2 ℏω. Same as Cartesian.\n\nFor N_cart=2⇒ 2n_r + l=2. Possible pairs: n_r=0, l=2; or n_r=1, l=0. Each group (l=2 and l=0) in spherical. Hence, multiplicity is (2l+1). For l=2: 5 and l=0:1. So total 6 states, same as Cartesian N=2 (which also, in cartesian, has (2 +3 -1 choose2)=6 states.) Hence, matching.\n\nSo in the problem, the third excited state would correspond to Cart. N=3. Then 2n_r l_o=3. Possible combinations:\n\nn_r=0, l=3; or n_r=1, l=1.\n\nTherefore, From spherical coordinates, The energy levels would have different l for same N_cart. For N_cart=3, which is 2n_r + l=3.\n\nSo possible (n_r, l):\n\n0, 3; 1,1. So l=3 and l=1 states contribute. Then multiplicities: l=3 gives 7 states (2*3+1=7), l=1 gives 3 states (2*1+1=3). So total 10 states. So 7 +3= 10 states. Thus also matching Cartesian approach. So equality total number 10.\n\nWait for N_cart=3: spc(3 =2n_r + l) gives n_r=0, l=3 and n_r=1, l=1.\n\nTotal states across these are (2*3 +1)=7 for l=3 and (2*1 +1)=3 for l=1. So total 7 +3=10. Same as cartesian counting.\n\nThus whether in spherical or Cartesian, the total degenaracy same. Hence regardless of coordinates, the N_th eigenvalue energy (3 (Cartesian) / corresponding spherical via different n_r and l) has same number of states.\n\nThus, so the answer to the original problem? The third excited state would be the fourth energy level, so n=3 (if we consider ground state as n=0). The energy is (3 +3/2) ħω=9/2 ħω. with degeneracy 10.\n\nGiven that the question specified potential in spherical coordinates, but explicit calculation relates the results through Cartesian counting, yes. So the answers are energy of 9/2 ℏω and ten-fold degeneracy.\n\nAlternative path: Remember that in an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy is given by E = ħω(n + 3/2) where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each coordinate. The allowed values for n (which we called N earlier) is 0,1,2,3,… with corresponding energies each higher by ħω ( spacing by ħω a each step). In this case, the ground state (n=0) is 3/2. Each additional level increases n by 1. Therefore, the third excited state is indeed when n=3. Compute the degeneracy by combinations.\n\nHence, the answer he energy is (3 + 3/2) ℏω=9/2 ℏω. The number of eigenfunctions is the number of such possible (n_x,n_y_n_z) with sum=3, which is 10. 10 linearly independent eigenstates.\n\nThus，the energy value is (9/2)ħω and the number of eigenstates for that energy is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy of the third excited state is \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{2} \\hbar \\omega} and there are \\boxed{10} linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743845788, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4725, prompt_tokens=476, total_tokens=5201, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \):

1. **Energy Levels**: The energy levels for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by \( E = \hbar \omega (N + \frac{3}{2}) \), where \( N \) is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three Cartesian directions, i.e., \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \). The quantum number \( N \) is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

2. **Excitation Levels**:
   - The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \).
   - The first excited state corresponds to \( N = 1 \).
   - The second excited state corresponds to \( N = 2 \).
   - The third excited state corresponds to \( N = 3 \).

3. **Energy Calculation**: For the third excited state (\( N = 3 \)), the energy is:
   \[
   E = \hbar \omega \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
   \]

4. **Degeneracy Calculation**: The number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) for a given \( N \) is the number of ways to distribute \( N \) quanta among the three directions \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is given by the combinatorial formula:
   \[
   \binom{N + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{N + 2}{2}
   \]
   For \( N = 3 \):
   \[
   \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10
   \]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \(\boxed{\dfrac{9}{2} \hbar \omega}\) and there are \(\boxed{10}\) linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.

 case, the energy levels are labelled by N, which equals n_x + n_y + n_z. For the ground state, N = 0, which gives E_0 = (0 + 3/2)ħω = (3/2)ħω. The first excited state would be N = 1, then N = 2 for the second excited, and N = 3 for the third excited state. Wait – hold on. Typically, the ground state is the lowest energy. The first excited state is the next possible energy level. Wait, but considering how energy is determined by N. So the quantum number N is the sum of n_x, n_y, n_z. So in 3D, for each N, different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z sum up to N, which gives the same energy E_N = (N + 3/2)ħω.

However, need to confirm the ordering. For the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are evenly spaced with spacing ħω. But each successive N gives a new energy level. For a given N, the energy is E = (N + 3/2)ħω. Then the ground state corresponds to N = 0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3.

But wait let me make sure. Let us take the ground state: N = 0, all n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. First excited state is N = 1: e.g., (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). Thus energy E = (1 + 3/2)ħω = 5/2 ħω. Then the second excited would be N =2, that is combinations where n_x + n_y + n_z = 2 and so on. Therefore, the third excited state would correspond to N=3. Hence, the energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω. So energy is 9/2 ħω. Then, number of eigenfunctions? Well, how many eigenfunctions correspond to N=3? Possibilities: They distribute 3 quanta in 3 dimensions. The number is given by the combination with repetition, which is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1 ) = (5 choose 2) = 10. Alternatively, the number of ways to arrange three indistinct quanta in three distinct oscillators is (3 + 3 -1)!/(3!(3 -1)!) ) No, formula for number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x +n_y +n_z = N is (N + 3 -1 choose 3 -1 ) which is (N + 2 choose 2). Plugging N=3: (3 +2 choose 2) = 5C2 = 10. So that would imply that the degeneracy is 10. So the third excited state (N=3) has energy 9/2 ħω and degeneracy 10. 

But let's confirm the definition of "excited states". Ground state is the lowest energy, which here is 3/2 ħω. Next, first excited state is next level, which is 5/2 ħω (N=1) with degeneracy 3. Then the second is 7/2 ħω (N=2), degeneracy 6? Wait, if N=2, then the number of states is (2 + 2) choose 2 = 4C2=6, yes that's right. Then third excited state is N=3, E=9/2 ħω with 10 states. So per that, the third excited state indeed corresponds to N=3.

Alternatively, by the standard hydrogen atom, excited states are ordinal: n-th excited state referring to n=1 then 2, etc. Here, since the first energy level above the ground is N=1. So each N corresponds to different energy levels, and for each, the Rung counts the number. Then the nth excited state would be N= n. But assuming the question follows that. Thus, third excited is N=3, hence energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω=9/2 ħω, which would often be written as E= (9/2)ħω. Then the number of eigenfunctions is the degneracy, which is (3 +3 -1 choose3 -1 )=10, as calculated before.

Alternatively, in the 3D harmonic oscillator, the number of states for a given N (since the energy levels are labeled by N) is the same combination problem. Number of states for a given N is number of non-negative integers (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that n_x + n_y + n_z = N. Thus, in combinatorics, this is equivalent to the stars and bars theorem. The formula is (N + d -1 choose d -1) where d is the dimension. Here, d=3, hence (N + 2 choose 2). So for N=3: (3 + 2) choose 2 is 5 choose 2 = 10. So, yes, 10 states. Therefore, the answer should be 9/2 ħω and 10 eigenfunctions. But let me just check. For example, when N=0, yes, all zeros, 1 state. For N=1, three states (each coordinate given a single quantum). N=2: six states (possible triples (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1)). So that depends on whether order matters; of the arrangements? Yes, because each direction is distinct. Hence, that is correct. For N=2: triple with two quanta in each possible direction, and different permutations. 3 permutations for two of the same and one different, and then three cases here, but actually E.g., (2,0,0), (0,2,0), etc. are three states. And (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), another three, totaling 6; that's right, which is indeed 6. For N=3, let's list them: Quantities adding to 3. We can have:

- 3 in one coordinate: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) -> 3 states.

- 2 in one, 1 in another: (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2). So per number of coordinates for choosing which has 2, which has 1: For each pair of coordinates, 2 in one and 1 in the other. E.g., Between x and y, x and z, y and z. Each pair contributes two permutations (which one has 2 and which has 1). So 3 pairs and 2 each gives 6.

- All three different with 1 in each. Wait, but 1+1+1 =3? No, that would be N=3 with (1,1,1) but 1+1+1=3. So (1,1,1). So another one state. Wait, but 1+1+1=3, so that's also permitted. So total is 3 + 6 +1=10 states.

Wait, but wait, (1,1,1) is possible? Then yes, but does that sum up to 3? Yes. 1+1+1=3. But that seems like perhaps if N=3, you can have (n_x, n_y, n_z)= (3,0,0), permutations, then (2,1,0) permutations, and (1,1,1). So summing x, n_x etc. And these would all add up to three. So (1,1,1) describes a state where each coordinate has one quantum. So that's allowed, yes.

But hang on, in one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, each direction is quantized. The n_x, n_y, n_z applies to each direction. The 3D harmonic oscillator can have even eigenfunctions where each direction is set to its own n_x etc. So in total, in 3D, n_x +n_y +n_z = N. So yes, n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. Therefore, for N=3, the possible combinations are:

Type 1: All three quanta in one direction. (3,0,0) and permutations, gives 3 states.

Type 2: Two quanta in one direction and 1 in another. (2,1,0) permutations. Number here: for choosing which direction is 2, which is 1, and which is 0.

There are 3 choices for the direction to assign 2 quanta, then 2 choices left for the direction with 1, and the last is 0. So 3*2=6, so 6 states.

Type 3: One quantum each in all three directions. So (1,1,1). Since all directions must be 1, this configuration is uniquely defined. Thus, only 1 state.

Therefore, 3 +6+1=10. Hence, 10 states, each with E=(3 +3/2)ħω=9/2 ħω.

Therefore, the third excited state is 9/2 ħω, with 10 degenerate eigenfunctions.

Alternative Thought: Alternatively, if considering the radial quantum number and angular momentum, but since the assignment stated that in the spherical polar coordinate. However, in Cartesian coordinates, as we've previously explored, it's straightforward, but how does this translate when moving to spherical coordinates? In three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated either in Cartesian or in spherical coordinates, with eigenstates characterized by quantum numbers n_r (radial) and l (angular momentum), and the energy depends on n_r and l as E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ħω. But Cartesian and spherical approaches should agree, as they are just different coordinate systems. So how does this connection work.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, remember that the energy levels degenaracy (which we are calculating in Cartesian by assigning different (n_x, n_y, n_z)) can also be considered by collective quantum number usually N =2 n_r + l. So in that case, under that understanding, E = (N + 3/2) ħω. Here, different combination of n_r and l can contribute to the same N, so same energy. Let's check. Let’s think in terms of spherical coordinates. So energy E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ħω = (N + 3/2)ħω where N=2n_r + l. Then for a given E, which requires N being even or odd depending on combinations.

But in the Cartesian sense, the total energy comes from N = n_x +n_y +n_z. Therefore, in three dimensions, can we have each energy level E_N expressed through either approach. But |it is essential to note. The two methods (Cartesian and Spherical) need to yield the same energy spectrum, so they must reconcile their quantum numbers for the same energy.

Let me consider that notion. Suppose in spherical coordinates, the energy is given by E = (2n_r + l + 3/2) ħω, whereas in Cartesian coordinates E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Therefore comparing them:

In Cartesian, energies are spaced by 1 in terms of N (i.e., n_x + n_y + n_z). So 0,1,2,3,...

In spherical, energies depend on pairs (n_r, l), with 2n_r + l equalling N. So the same energy is parametrized by different (n_r, l), giving l from 0 what’s allowed?

For example:

Suppose N=0: 2n_r + l =0. Therefore, n_r=0, l=0.

N=1: 2n_r + l=1. Possible solutions: n_r =0, l=1; or perhaps if negative numbers are allowed, but n_r must be non-negative integers and l non-negative integers, so here n_r=0, l=1 is the only possible value.

But in Cartesian, for N=1 (nX +nY +nZ=1), which has degeneracy 3. While in spherical coordinates, perhaps l=1 (want that?), so how many states are that?

For N=1=2n_r + l implies n_r=0, l=1, so angular momentum l=1. The number of states for l=1 is multiplicity 2l+1=3. Therefore it's three states, same as Cartesian. So something is consistent.

Then N=2 (so 2n_r + l =2). Then possibilities:

n_r=0, l=2.

n_r=1, l=0.

So two possibilities. For each (n_r, l), we have 2l+1 states: number of states when N=2 would be for l=2: 5 states (2*2+1=5), and for l=0:1 state (n_r=1, l=0).

But Cartesian N=2 accounts for (n_x +n_y +n_z=2), which is 6 states. But in spherical, these are 6 states made up of l=2, m=-2,-1,0,1,2 (5 states) and l=0 (1 state). Together, 5+1=6. Exactly matches with Cartesian; the same applies with energy. Thus E=(2 +3/2)ħω=7/2 ħω? Wait, oh in Cartesian energy is (N +3/2) so N=2 here. But per equations in spherical coordinates, same N but with E=(2n_r + l +3/2)=? If n_r=0, l=2, then 0 + 2 + 3/2= (5/2).

No, conflict arises. Wait, seems different.

Wait, either mistake is present. Let me re-express: Need to check the correspondence.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from using the same symbol N in Cartesian and spherical, but perhaps here they differ.

Wait Can't be. Let me think again.

In Cartesian: E = (n_x +n_y +n_z +3/2)ℏω.

Spherical coch.: E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ℏω.

In order for energy levels to match, (N_{cart} +3/2)ℏω must equate with (2n_r + l + 3/2)ℏω.

Hence, equating N_{cart} = 2n_r + l. Therefore, for a given N_spherical (where E = (N +3/2…) and similar.

So, in the two pictures—Cartesian and spherical—for the same energy, different quantum numbers. For instance, for Cart. N: 0: (3/2);

For Cart N=1: (5/2);

Cart N=2:7/2;


Spherical:

Energy (same as Cart's N) would correspond to:

Energy = (2n_r + l +3/2).

So, algebraic needs 2n_r +l = N_cart.

So for N_cart=0: 2n_r + l=0 ⇒n_r=0, l=0. Then (N=0, E=3/2) in cart corresponds to (n_r=0, l=0, m=0) in spherical.

For N_cart=1⇒ 2n_r + l=1; only possible if n_r=0, l=1. Then the energy is (1+3/2)ℏω=5/2 ℏω. Same as Cartesian.

For N_cart=2⇒ 2n_r + l=2. Possible pairs: n_r=0, l=2; or n_r=1, l=0. Each group (l=2 and l=0) in spherical. Hence, multiplicity is (2l+1). For l=2: 5 and l=0:1. So total 6 states, same as Cartesian N=2 (which also, in cartesian, has (2 +3 -1 choose2)=6 states.) Hence, matching.

So in the problem, the third excited state would correspond to Cart. N=3. Then 2n_r l_o=3. Possible combinations:

n_r=0, l=3; or n_r=1, l=1.

Therefore, From spherical coordinates, The energy levels would have different l for same N_cart. For N_cart=3, which is 2n_r + l=3.

So possible (n_r, l):

0, 3; 1,1. So l=3 and l=1 states contribute. Then multiplicities: l=3 gives 7 states (2*3+1=7), l=1 gives 3 states (2*1+1=3). So total 10 states. So 7 +3= 10 states. Thus also matching Cartesian approach. So equality total number 10.

Wait for N_cart=3: spc(3 =2n_r + l) gives n_r=0, l=3 and n_r=1, l=1.

Total states across these are (2*3 +1)=7 for l=3 and (2*1 +1)=3 for l=1. So total 7 +3=10. Same as cartesian counting.

Thus whether in spherical or Cartesian, the total degenaracy same. Hence regardless of coordinates, the N_th eigenvalue energy (3 (Cartesian) / corresponding spherical via different n_r and l) has same number of states.

Thus, so the answer to the original problem? The third excited state would be the fourth energy level, so n=3 (if we consider ground state as n=0). The energy is (3 +3/2) ħω=9/2 ħω. with degeneracy 10.

Given that the question specified potential in spherical coordinates, but explicit calculation relates the results through Cartesian counting, yes. So the answers are energy of 9/2 ℏω and ten-fold degeneracy.

Alternative path: Remember that in an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy is given by E = ħω(n + 3/2) where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each coordinate. The allowed values for n (which we called N earlier) is 0,1,2,3,… with corresponding energies each higher by ħω ( spacing by ħω a each step). In this case, the ground state (n=0) is 3/2. Each additional level increases n by 1. Therefore, the third excited state is indeed when n=3. Compute the degeneracy by combinations.

Hence, the answer he energy is (3 + 3/2) ℏω=9/2 ℏω. The number of eigenfunctions is the number of such possible (n_x,n_y_n_z) with sum=3, which is 10. 10 linearly independent eigenstates.

Thus，the energy value is (9/2)ħω and the number of eigenstates for that energy is 10.

**Final Answer**
The energy of the third excited state is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{2} \hbar \omega} and there are \boxed{10} linearly independent eigenfunctions.

Therefore, for N=3, the energy would be (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people might count excited states starting from N=1 as the first excited state, N=2 as the second, so third would be N=3. However, usually, excited states are numbered by the number of steps above the ground state, so if the ground state is N=0, then first excited is N=1, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the third excited state would be E = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.\n\nNow, the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is given by the number of ways to distribute N quanta among the three dimensions. For the 3D harmonic oscillator, the number of states with total quantum number N is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. But wait, let me make sure about this formula.\n\nIn a 3D harmonic oscillator using Cartesian coordinates, the number of states with a given N (where N = n_x + n_y + n_z) is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N. The formula for this is (N + 3 - 1 choose 3 - 1) = (N + 2 choose 2) which is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. But hold on, that\'s when three non-negative integers sum to N. So for example, when N =3, we have (3 + 2)(3 +1)/2 = (5)(4)/2 = 10. So the number of states (or degeneracy) for energy level N=3 would be 10. Therefore, for the third excited state (N=3), the degeneracy is 10.\n\nBut to check this with the standard formula: the degeneracy in 3D SHO is indeed (N + 1)(N + 2)/2. Let me confirm for N=0: degeneracy 1 (correct, only n_x = n_y = n_z= 0). For N=1: (1+2)(1+1)/2= 6/2=3; correct, with (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). For N=2: (2 +2)(2 +1)/2 = 12/2 =6; correct. For N=3: as above, yes 10. So yes, the degeneracy is 10 for N=3. Therefore, the third excited state has energy (9/2)ħω and degeneracy 10. Thus, the energy is (9/2)ħω, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nBut I should double-check if the formula may account for different quantum numbers. If it is expressed as E = (n +3/2) ħω where n can also refer to the principal quantum number n = 2n_r + l, then how does this mapping work? Wait, in spherical coordinates (using n_r and l), the energy levels for the isotropic harmonic oscillator are E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ħω.\n\nIn such notation, the principal quantum number for the 3D oscillator is sometimes identified as N = 2n_r + l, and so the energy is (N + 3/2)ħω. Then, for example, N is an integer greater or equal to zero. The degeneracy here would correspond to grouping of all states with the same value of 2n_r + l. To find the number of states for given N, the usual approach is combinatorics. For example, 2n_r + l = N. Then, possible (n_r, l) pairs would be determined for every allowed l such that N - l is even and non-negative, then compute the possible values of m (since for each l, m ranges from -l to +l). However, this gets complicated.\n\nBut in Cartesian coordinates, since each dimension is independent, the total energy is determined by N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each such N corresponds to an energy level (N + 3/2)ħω, and the number of distinct states (degeneracy) is given by (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. Since this is straightforward and aligns with the initial approach, perhaps focusing on Cartesian coordinates is simpler here given the problem statement.\n\nAdditionally, the problem just refers to an isotropic three-dimensional potential, so perhaps its the standard harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are given by the sum of the energies of three 1D harmonic oscillators. Each 1D oscillator\'s energy is (n_i + 1/2)ħω where n_i is the quantum number in direction i. Hence, sum over all three gives the total energy as (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω. Hence, the total energy depends on N = n_x + n_y + n_z. The ground state is N=0. The first excited state is N=1, with degeneracy 3 (three ways to set one of the n_i to 1 and rest to 0); second excited state N=2, degeneracy 6 and third N=3 with degeneracy 10 as the pattern of combnatorial numbers.\n\nAlternately, he might be blaming degeneracy. So with that logic, for N=3, degeneracy is (3 + 2)(3 + 1)/2 = 10. So, both energy and degeneracy agreed. So then, finally, the answer is energy is (9/2)ħomega and degeneracy is 10.\n\nAlternatively, consider eigenfunctions listed in spherical coordinates for potential V(r). Wait, no, if the potential is isotropic, spherical coordinates can be used. In that case, eigenstates are labeled by n_r and l. The energy would is then E_{n_r l} = ħω(2n_r + l + 3/2). So, for each energy level, given by E= ( N + 3/2 ) ħω, where N = 2n_r + l. Thus for fixed energy eigenvalue, different values of l and n_r can combine to give the same N. Hence, the degeneracy in that picture would be different. For each N, all possible (n_r, l) with 2n_r + l = N. For each l, n_r = (N -l)/2. So l can be N, N -2, ..., down to 0 or 1, depending on whether N is even or odd. For each such l, the multiplicity is (2l + 1) from the angular momentum states. Then, summing over all possible l\'s for fixed N. So degeneracy would be sum_{l=0,2,...}^N (2l +1) if N is even, or sum_{l=1,3,...}^N (2l +1) if N is odd. \n\nBut combinatorially, that sum equals (N +1)(N +2)/2. For example, take N=1: l can be 1: 2*1 +1=3. So degeneracy would be 3. Which matches the Cartesian answer.\n\nFor N=2: l can be 0,2. Then 2*0 +1=1 and 2*2 +1=5. Total 1+5=6. Which matches the Cartesian (N=2) case. Degeneracy is 6.\n\nFor N=3: l can be 1,3. Then 2*1+1=3 and 2*3+1=7. Total degeneracy 3+7=10. Which matches the Cartesian.\n\nSo, regardless of coordinates, the degeneracy is (N +1)(N +2)/2. So each way, the answer is the same. Therefore, for N=3 (third excited state), energy (9/2)ħω, degeneracy 10.\n\nTherefore, the value of energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nBut let me confirm once again: ground state is n=0 (not ground state energy N=0 with E=3/2 ħω). So let\'s list the possible states:\n\nGround state (n_x, n_y, n_z)= (0,0,0): E= (0 + 0 + 0 +3/2)ħω=3/2 ħω.\n\nFirst Excited states (n_x, n_y, n_z) = (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1): three states, with E=(1 +0 +0 +3/2)ħω=5/2 ħω.\n\nSecond Excited states: are they N=2? Let\'s check. (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). That\'s six states. Then E= (2 + 0 + 0 +3/2) =7/2, which is same as  (1+1+0 +3/2)= 9/2? Wait, hold on. Wait no.\n\nWait, N is sum of quantum numbers. The first excited state is when N=1 (as before), with E= (1 + 3/2)ħω= 5/2 ħomega. (If N=n_x+n_y+n_z, then that\'s correct). Then for the second excited state, N=2.

To determine the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \), we start by noting that the energy levels are given by the sum of the quantum numbers in each Cartesian direction. 

The energy levels for a 3D harmonic oscillator are given by:
\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2} \right)
\]
where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. The principal quantum number \( N \) is the sum \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \). The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state to \( N = 1 \), the second excited state to \( N = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( N = 3 \).

For \( N = 3 \), the energy is:
\[
E = \hbar \omega \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for a given \( N \) is the number of ways to distribute \( N \) quanta among the three dimensions. This is calculated using the combination formula for distributing \( N \) indistinguishable items into 3 distinguishable bins:
\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{N + 2}{2} = \frac{(N + 2)(N + 1)}{2}
\]

For \( N = 3 \):
\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega}\) and there are \(\boxed{10}\) linearly independent eigenfunctions.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 The different eigenfunctions for the same energy level would be determined by the different combinations of n_x, n_y, and n_z that sum to the same N, accounting for the degeneracy.

Now, the question states the "third excited state". To clarify, the ground state is the lowest energy level, which is N=0 (since n_x, n_y, n_z all equal zero). Then the first excited state corresponds to N=1, the second excited state N=2, and the third excited state N=3. Therefore, for N=3, the energy would be (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.

But wait, sometimes people might count excited states starting from N=1 as the first excited state, N=2 as the second, so third would be N=3. However, usually, excited states are numbered by the number of steps above the ground state, so if the ground state is N=0, then first excited is N=1, which matches.

Therefore, the energy of the third excited state would be E = (3 + 3/2)ħω = (9/2)ħω.

Now, the degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) is given by the number of ways to distribute N quanta among the three dimensions. For the 3D harmonic oscillator, the number of states with total quantum number N is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. But wait, let me make sure about this formula.

In a 3D harmonic oscillator using Cartesian coordinates, the number of states with a given N (where N = n_x + n_y + n_z) is the same as the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N. The formula for this is (N + 3 - 1 choose 3 - 1) = (N + 2 choose 2) which is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. But hold on, that's when three non-negative integers sum to N. So for example, when N =3, we have (3 + 2)(3 +1)/2 = (5)(4)/2 = 10. So the number of states (or degeneracy) for energy level N=3 would be 10. Therefore, for the third excited state (N=3), the degeneracy is 10.

But to check this with the standard formula: the degeneracy in 3D SHO is indeed (N + 1)(N + 2)/2. Let me confirm for N=0: degeneracy 1 (correct, only n_x = n_y = n_z= 0). For N=1: (1+2)(1+1)/2= 6/2=3; correct, with (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). For N=2: (2 +2)(2 +1)/2 = 12/2 =6; correct. For N=3: as above, yes 10. So yes, the degeneracy is 10 for N=3. Therefore, the third excited state has energy (9/2)ħω and degeneracy 10. Thus, the energy is (9/2)ħω, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.

But I should double-check if the formula may account for different quantum numbers. If it is expressed as E = (n +3/2) ħω where n can also refer to the principal quantum number n = 2n_r + l, then how does this mapping work? Wait, in spherical coordinates (using n_r and l), the energy levels for the isotropic harmonic oscillator are E = (2n_r + l + 3/2)ħω.

In such notation, the principal quantum number for the 3D oscillator is sometimes identified as N = 2n_r + l, and so the energy is (N + 3/2)ħω. Then, for example, N is an integer greater or equal to zero. The degeneracy here would correspond to grouping of all states with the same value of 2n_r + l. To find the number of states for given N, the usual approach is combinatorics. For example, 2n_r + l = N. Then, possible (n_r, l) pairs would be determined for every allowed l such that N - l is even and non-negative, then compute the possible values of m (since for each l, m ranges from -l to +l). However, this gets complicated.

But in Cartesian coordinates, since each dimension is independent, the total energy is determined by N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each such N corresponds to an energy level (N + 3/2)ħω, and the number of distinct states (degeneracy) is given by (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. Since this is straightforward and aligns with the initial approach, perhaps focusing on Cartesian coordinates is simpler here given the problem statement.

Additionally, the problem just refers to an isotropic three-dimensional potential, so perhaps its the standard harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are given by the sum of the energies of three 1D harmonic oscillators. Each 1D oscillator's energy is (n_i + 1/2)ħω where n_i is the quantum number in direction i. Hence, sum over all three gives the total energy as (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω. Hence, the total energy depends on N = n_x + n_y + n_z. The ground state is N=0. The first excited state is N=1, with degeneracy 3 (three ways to set one of the n_i to 1 and rest to 0); second excited state N=2, degeneracy 6 and third N=3 with degeneracy 10 as the pattern of combnatorial numbers.

Alternately, he might be blaming degeneracy. So with that logic, for N=3, degeneracy is (3 + 2)(3 + 1)/2 = 10. So, both energy and degeneracy agreed. So then, finally, the answer is energy is (9/2)ħomega and degeneracy is 10.

Alternatively, consider eigenfunctions listed in spherical coordinates for potential V(r). Wait, no, if the potential is isotropic, spherical coordinates can be used. In that case, eigenstates are labeled by n_r and l. The energy would is then E_{n_r l} = ħω(2n_r + l + 3/2). So, for each energy level, given by E= ( N + 3/2 ) ħω, where N = 2n_r + l. Thus for fixed energy eigenvalue, different values of l and n_r can combine to give the same N. Hence, the degeneracy in that picture would be different. For each N, all possible (n_r, l) with 2n_r + l = N. For each l, n_r = (N -l)/2. So l can be N, N -2, ..., down to 0 or 1, depending on whether N is even or odd. For each such l, the multiplicity is (2l + 1) from the angular momentum states. Then, summing over all possible l's for fixed N. So degeneracy would be sum_{l=0,2,...}^N (2l +1) if N is even, or sum_{l=1,3,...}^N (2l +1) if N is odd. 

But combinatorially, that sum equals (N +1)(N +2)/2. For example, take N=1: l can be 1: 2*1 +1=3. So degeneracy would be 3. Which matches the Cartesian answer.

For N=2: l can be 0,2. Then 2*0 +1=1 and 2*2 +1=5. Total 1+5=6. Which matches the Cartesian (N=2) case. Degeneracy is 6.

For N=3: l can be 1,3. Then 2*1+1=3 and 2*3+1=7. Total degeneracy 3+7=10. Which matches the Cartesian.

So, regardless of coordinates, the degeneracy is (N +1)(N +2)/2. So each way, the answer is the same. Therefore, for N=3 (third excited state), energy (9/2)ħω, degeneracy 10.

Therefore, the value of energy of the third excited state is (9/2)ħω and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.

But let me confirm once again: ground state is n=0 (not ground state energy N=0 with E=3/2 ħω). So let's list the possible states:

Ground state (n_x, n_y, n_z)= (0,0,0): E= (0 + 0 + 0 +3/2)ħω=3/2 ħω.

First Excited states (n_x, n_y, n_z) = (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1): three states, with E=(1 +0 +0 +3/2)ħω=5/2 ħω.

Second Excited states: are they N=2? Let's check. (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). That's six states. Then E= (2 + 0 + 0 +3/2) =7/2, which is same as  (1+1+0 +3/2)= 9/2? Wait, hold on. Wait no.

Wait, N is sum of quantum numbers. The first excited state is when N=1 (as before), with E= (1 + 3/2)ħω= 5/2 ħomega. (If N=n_x+n_y+n_z, then that's correct). Then for the second excited state, N=2. Which energy is (2 +3/2) ħω=7/2 ħomega.

Third excited state, N=3, which gives (3 +3/2)=9/2ħω.

So the energy steps are E_n = (n +3/2) ħomega, with n=0,1,2,3...

So the third excited state's energy is 9/2 ħomega and degeneracy (3+1)(3+2)/2= 4*5/2=10, which matches. So yes, those are the correct numbers.

Thus, boxed up, the energy is \boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega} and the number of eigenfunctions is \boxed{10}.


**Final Answer**
The energy of the third excited state is \boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega} and there are \boxed{10} linearly independent eigenfunctions.
