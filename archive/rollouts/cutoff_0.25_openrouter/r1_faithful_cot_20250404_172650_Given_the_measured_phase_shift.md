To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, given the phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\), we use the optical theorem. The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is given by:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l
\]

Given that we can ignore phase shifts beyond \(l=4\), the summation is only over \(l = 0\) to \(4\).

First, we compute each term \((2l + 1) \sin^2 \delta_l\):

- For \(l = 0\): \(1 \cdot \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1^2 = 1\)
- For \(l = 1\): \(3 \cdot \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.8473 \approx 2.5419\)
- For \(l = 2\): \(5 \cdot \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.6710 \approx 3.355\)
- For \(l = 3\): \(7 \cdot \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75\)
- For \(l = 4\): \(9 \cdot \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot (0.2250)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 \approx 0.4554\)

Summing these terms:

\[
1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023
\]

Next, we calculate the wave number \(k\). For 50 MeV electrons, the total energy \(E = 50 \text{ MeV} + 0.511 \text{ MeV} = 50.511 \text{ MeV}\). The momentum \(p\) is:

\[
pc = \sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2} = \sqrt{50.511^2 - 0.511^2} \approx 50.508 \text{ MeV}
\]

The wave number \(k\) is given by:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar c} = \frac{50.508 \text{ MeV}}{197.33 \text{ MeV·fm}} \approx 0.256 \text{ fm}^{-1}
\]

Finally, using the optical theorem result:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{9.1023}{0.256} \approx 35.6 \text{ fm}
\]

Thus, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \(\boxed{35.6~\text{fm}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, given the phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. Hmm... I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Let me recall the formula for the scattering amplitude. 

From what I remember, the scattering amplitude f(θ) in partial wave expansion is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. Specifically, each partial wave contributes a term involving the phase shift δ_l. The general formula should be something like:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ)

Where k is the wave number, θ is the scattering angle, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But in this problem, we're asked about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is the forward direction (θ = 0°). 

Since the incident beam direction corresponds to θ = 0, that simplifies the Legendre polynomials, because P_l(1) = 1 for all l. Let me confirm that—yes, Legendre polynomials evaluated at cosθ = 1 (since θ = 0) give P_l(1) = 1. So in this case, all the P_l(cosθ) terms become 1. Therefore, the scattering amplitude in the forward direction simplifies to:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

But the problem states that we can ignore the phase shifts beyond l=4, since they give δ₀ to δ₄, so we only need to sum up to l=4. So the sum becomes from l=0 to 4.

Therefore, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

However, we need the imaginary part of f(0). Let's first work on simplifying f(0) and then take its imaginary part.

First, let's write out each term of the sum:

For each l from 0 to 4:
Term_l = (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

Therefore, the sum is:

Sum = Term_0 + Term_1 + Term_2 + Term_3 + Term_4

But we need to compute the imaginary part of Sum, then multiply it by 1/(2ik) and take the imaginary part of that.

Wait, no: f(0) = (Sum)/(2ik), so imaginary part of f(0) would be [Im(Sum)] / (2ik), but wait, actually, it's:

Im[f(0)] = Im[ (Sum)/(2ik) ]

Since 1/(2ik) is a complex scalar, let's compute that properly.

First, let’s write 1/(2ik). The wave number k is real for elastic scattering, right? Since we're dealing with a beam of electrons of 50 MeV, which is a real potential (assuming elastic scattering does not involve absorption or inelastic channels, hence the S-matrix is unitary and the phase shifts are real). Therefore, k is real. Therefore, 1/(2ik) is purely imaginary, -i/(2k). So, 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k). Therefore:

Im[f(0)] = Im[ (-i/(2k)) * Sum ]

So, multiplying Sum by -i/(2k), which is an imaginary number (since k is real). 

Therefore, Im[f(0)] would be equal to:

Re[ Sum ] * (-1/(2k)) + Im[ Sum ] * 0 ...Wait, no. Wait, perhaps let me do it step by step. If I have a complex number A = a + ib, and multiply by -i/(2k), then the result is (-i/(2k))(a + ib) = (-i a)/(2k) + (-i^2 b)/(2k) = (-i a)/(2k) + b/(2k), since i² = -1.

Therefore, the real part of (-i/(2k)) * Sum is Re[ (-i/(2k) * Sum ) ] = Re[ b/(2k) - i a/(2k) ] = b/(2k). The imaginary part is (-a)/(2k). But since f(0) = (-i/(2k))* Sum, its real part is Re[f(0)] = Re[ (-i/(2k) Sum ) ] = (Im(Sum))/(2k), and the imaginary part is Im[f(0)] = (- Re(Sum) )/(2k).

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this correctly. Let's note that:

Given f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Sum, then 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k). Therefore, f(0) = (-i)/(2k) * Sum.

Expressing Sum as Sum_real + i Sum_imag, then:

f(0) = (-i/(2k)) (Sum_real + i Sum_imag) ) = (-i Sum_real)/(2k) - i^2 Sum_imag/(2k) = (-i Sum_real)/(2k) + Sum_imag/(2k)

Therefore, the real part of f(0) is Sum_imag/(2k), and the imaginary part of f(0) is (-Sum_real)/(2k). So:

Im[f(0)] = (-Sum_real)/(2k)

Therefore, to compute Im[f(0)], we need to find the real part of the Sum (Sum_real), multiply by -1/(2k) and that gives the result.

So first, compute Sum = Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

Let me compute each term (2l +1)(e^{i 2δ_l} -1). Let's compute each term one by one.

First, for each l from 0 to 4:

l=0: 2*0 + 1 = 1, δ₀ = 90°, so 2δ₀ = 180°, so e^{i 180°} = e^{iπ} = -1. Then, (e^{i2δ₀} -1) = (-1 - 1) = -2.

Therefore, Term0 = 1*(-2) = -2

Similarly for l=1: 2l+1=3, δ₁=67°, so 2δ₁=134°, e^{i134°} = cos134° + i sin134°. Let me compute that.

Wait, 134°: since cos(134°)=cos(180°-46°)= -cos(46°), sin(134°)=sin(46°). So:

Term1 = 3*(cos134° + i sin134° - 1) = 3*(-cos46° - 1 + i sin46°)

Let me calculate numerical values, let me recall that cos46° ≈ 0.6947, sin46°≈0.7193.

So Term1 = 3*( -0.6947 - 1 + i*0.7193 ) = 3*(-1.6947 + 0.7193i) ≈ -5.0841 + 2.1579i

Similarly for l=2: 2l+1=5, δ₂=55°, 2δ₂=110°, e^{i110°} = cos110° +i sin110°.

cos110°=cos(180°-70°)=-cos70°≈ -0.3420, sin110°=sin70°≈0.9397

Term2=5*(-0.3420 + i 0.9397 -1 ) =5*(-1.3420 +0.9397i ) ≈ -6.71 + 4.6985i

l=3: 2l+1=7, δ₃=30°, 2δ₃=60°, e^{i60°}=cos60° + i sin60°=0.5 + i*(√3/2)≈0.5 +i0.8660

Term3=7*(0.5 + i0.8660 -1 ) =7*(-0.5 +i0.8660 )= -3.5 + 6.062i

l=4: 2l+1=9, δ₄=13°, 2δ₄=26°, e^{i26°}=cos26° +i sin26°≈0.8988 +i0.4384

Term4=9*(0.8988 +i0.4384 -1 ) =9*(-0.1012 +i0.4384 )≈-0.9108 +3.9456i

Now, sum all the Terms:

Sum = Term0 + Term1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4

Real parts:
Term0_real = -2
Term1_real ≈ -5.0841
Term2_real ≈ -6.71
Term3_real ≈ -3.5
Term4_real ≈ -0.9108

Total real part: -2 -5.0841 -6.71 -3.5 -0.9108 ≈ Let's compute step by step:
Start with -2 -5.0841 = -7.0841
-7.0841 -6.71 = -13.7941
-13.7941 -3.5 = -17.2941
-17.2941 -0.9108 ≈ -18.2049 ≈ -18.205

Imaginary parts:
Term0_imag =0
Term1_imag≈2.1579
Term2_imag≈4.6985
Term3_imag≈6.062
Term4_imag≈3.9456

Sum Imaginary parts:
0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = Let's compute:
2.1579 +4.6985 =6.8564
6.8564 +6.062 =12.9184
12.9184 +3.9456 ≈16.864

Therefore, Sum ≈ -18.205 +16.864i

Therefore, Sum_real ≈ -18.205, Sum_Imag ≈16.864.

Then, as per previous, Im[f(0)] = (-Sum_real)/(2k)

Therefore, Im[f(0)] = (-(-18.205))/(2k) = 18.205/(2k) = 9.1025/k

So now the question is, what is the wave number k?

Wait, the problem mentions 50 MeV electrons. So we need to calculate k, the wave number. For electrons with kinetic energy T=50 MeV. But electrons are relativistic at 50 MeV, since the rest mass energy of electron is 0.511 MeV. Therefore, electrons are ultra-relativistic here. Therefore, perhaps we need to use relativistic formulae.

The wave number k is related to the momentum p by k = p/ħ. But since we're working in units where ħ = c = 1 in natural units, but maybe here we need to compute k in terms of the momentum. Let me recall how to relate the kinetic energy T to the wave number k.

First, for a relativistic particle, the total energy E = T + mc². Then, the momentum p is given by:

p = sqrt(E² - m²c⁴)/c

But E = T + mc², so:

p = sqrt( (T + mc²)² - m²c⁴ ) / c ) = sqrt(T² + 2 T mc² ) / c

Thus, since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm (approx), and k = p/ħ = (sqrt(T² + 2 T m c² )) / (ħ c )

But maybe let me compute this step by step.

Given:
T = 50 MeV
m c² = 0.511 MeV

So, compute sqrt(T² + 2 T m c² ) = sqrt(50² + 2 *50*0.511) = sqrt(2500 + 51.1) = sqrt(2551.1) ≈ 50.508 MeV

Wait, sqrt(2551.1): 50^2 =2500, 50.5^2=2550.25, so yes approximately 50.508 MeV.

Therefore, momentum p = sqrt(T² +2 T m c² ) / c = (50.508 MeV)/c

Then, wave number k = p / ħ = (50.508 MeV/c ) / ħ

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm / c

Therefore,

k = (50.508 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV·fm / c ) ) = 50.508 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈0.256 fm⁻¹

Converting this, 1 fm⁻¹ = 10¹⁵ m⁻¹, but perhaps we just need k ≈0.256 fm⁻¹.

But since k is in fm⁻¹, the units for Im[f(0)] would be in fm.

Wait, but let's check if I did this correctly.

Alternative approach: p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ), where E is total energy.

But perhaps in natural units (GeV, fm, etc.), but since here energies are given in MeV, and the answer probably just wants the numerical value in terms of inverse femtometers or in femtometers. Let me compute:

Using the formula k = p / ħ

Given that momentum p is in MeV/c, so p = E_kinetic_total_to_shit, wait, maybe another way.

Wait, since the electron is relativistic (50 MeV vs 0.511 MeV rest mass), the kinetic energy T is much larger than m c², so perhaps we can approximate p ≈ E/c ≈ T/c ?

But let's verify: For T=50MeV, but actually, the full formula would be E² = (pc)² + (mc²)^2. So, E = T + mc² =50.511 MeV.

Therefore, pc = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (50.511)^2 (1 - (0.511/50.511)^2 )) ≈ 50.511 * sqrt(1 - (~0.0101)^2 ) ≈50.511*(1 -0.00005)≈50.511 MeV

Therefore, pc≈50.511 MeV, so p≈50.511 MeV/c

Thus, k= p / ħ ≈50.511 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) ≈50.511 /197.33 fm⁻¹≈0.256 fm⁻¹

So, then k ≈0.256 fm⁻¹

Thus, the calculation for Im[f(0)] = 9.1025 / k ≈9.1025 /0.256 fm ≈35.55 fm

But wait, the answer should have units of length. Since f(θ) has units of length (as cross-section is measured in barns, etc.), so the imaginary part of f(0) would indeed have units of length.

But in our expression, 1/k has units of fm (since k is fm⁻¹), then 9.1025/k is 9.1025 × (1/0.256) fm ≈35.55 fm.

That seems plausible. However, let me double-check all steps.

First, check each term calculation:

For l=0:

2δ₀ = 180°, e^{i180} = -1. Therefore, term0 is 1*(-1 -1 )= -2, correct. That contributes -2.

For l=1:

(2δ₁)=134°, which is correct since δ₁=67°. cos(134) is cos(180-46)= -cos(46)≈-0.6947, sin(134)=sin(46)≈0.7193. Then, e^{i134°} is -0.6947 +0.7193i. Then e^{i2δ_l} -1 is (-0.6947 -1) +0.7193i = -1.6947 +0.7193i. Term1 is 3*(-1.6947 +0.7193i ), which gives Re: -5.0841, Im:2.1579. Correct.

l=2: 2δ₂=110°. cos(110)= -cos70≈-0.3420, sin110= sin70≈0.9397. Then e^{i110°}= -0.3420 +0.9397i. Then e^{i2δ_l} -1= (-0.3420 -1)+0.9397i= -1.3420 +0.9397i. Term2=5*(-1.3420 +0.9397i )= -6.71 +4.6985i. Correct.

l=3: 2δ₃=60°, cos60=0.5, sin60=0.8660. e^{i60°}=0.5 +0.8660i. e^{i60°}-1= -0.5 +0.8660i. Term3=7*(-0.5 +0.8660i)= -3.5 +6.062i. Correct.

l=4:2δ₄=26°, cos26≈0.8988, sin26≈0.4384. e^{i26}=0.8988 +0.4384i. e^{i26} -1= -0.1012 +0.4384i. Term4=9*(-0.1012 +0.4384i )= approx -0.9108 + 3.9456i. Correct.

Summing the real parts:

-2 -5.0841= -7.0841

-7.0841 -6.71= -13.7941

-13.7941 -3.5= -17.2941

-17.2941 -0.9108≈-18.2049 , say -18.205

Summed imaginary parts:

2.1579+4.6985=6.8564

6.8564+6.062=12.9184

12.9184+3.9456=16.864. Correct.

Thus, Sum=-18.205 +16.864i.

Therefore, Re(Sum)= -18.205. Therefore, Im[f(0)]= -Re(Sum)/(2k )= 18.205/(2k )=9.1025/k . Then k≈0.256 fm⁻¹ (from previous calculation), so:

Im[f(0)]≈9.1025 /0.256≈35.56 fm

Approximately 35.6 femtometers.

But let me check computation.

0.256 divided into 9.1025:

Compute k =0.256 fm⁻¹,

So 9.1025 /0.256:

Divide 9.1025 by 0.256:

9 /0.256≈35.15625

0.1025 /0.256≈0.4

Therefore, total ≈35.55~ish. So 35.6 or more precisely 35.55 fm.

But maybe it's due to more precise calculation. Let me take more decimals:

If k=50.508 /197.33≈0.2558 approximately 0.2558 fm⁻¹

Therefore, 9.1025 /0.2558≈ Let me compute:

9.1025 ÷0.2558:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10000: 91025 /2558≈

Calculate 2558*35 = 2558*30=76,740; 2558*5=12,790→76,740+12,790=89,530

But 35 ×2558=89,530; 89,530. 89,530 is less than 91,025. The difference is 1,495. Then 1,495 /2558 ≈0.584. Therefore, total≈35.584. So approximately35.6.

Hence, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction is approximately35.6 fm.

But the question is expecting an answer in a box. I need to check if perhaps there is a factor that I have wrong in the expression. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach.

Wait, another way. Wait, perhaps the optical theorem relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section. The optical theorem says Im f(0) = (k/4π) σ_total.

But wait, but that would imply that Im f(0) is proportional to the total cross-section. Wait, the total cross-section σ_total for elastic scattering (since the problem mentions elastic scattering) is given by σ_total = 4π/k² Σ (2l +1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, but perhaps here the problem refers only to elastic scattering, so σ_total would be the sum elastic cross-section, but given that our sum for f(0) here may give a different expression.

Alternatively, could my initial approach have overlooked something?

Wait, in many textbooks, the optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is (k/(4π)) σ_total. Let me check:

Yes, according to the optical theorem,

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) σ_total

And the total cross-section σ_total for elastic scattering (when there is no absorption or inelastic scattering) is given by σ_total = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin² δ_l

Then combining, Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l

But if that's the case, then perhaps Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l

But this is conflicting with our previous result. Therefore, in the possibility that there is a mistake in my original approach, or perhaps the optical theorem approach may give a direct way.

Wait, so wait, according to optical theorem:

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) σ_total

But σ_total for elastic scattering is sigma_elastic = (4π)/(k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l

Thus substituting:

Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l = (1/k) Σ_{l} (2l +1) sin²δ_l

Therefore, if that is correct, then:

Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l +1) sin²δ_l

Which is perhaps a simpler calculation.

But wait, why does this formula differ from our previous calculation?

Originally, the approach was based on the partial wave expansion's imaginary part. But the problem is that perhaps the given phase shifts are only up to l=4, so total sum would work for sigma_elastic but not applicable for the optical theorem unless higher l's don't contribute. But since the problem says to ignore higher l's, so the total cross-section would use those phase shifts.

Regardless, let me check if both approaches give the same answer. If they do not, indicate a mistake.

In the first approach:

Im[f(0)] was calculated as (1/k)*9.1025.

In the optical theorem approach:

Im[f(0)]=(1/k) Σ (2l +1)*sin²δ_l.

Wait, so let's compute Σ (2l +1)*sin²δ_l.

For l=0: 1*sin²(90°)=1*(1)^2=1.

l=1: 3*sin²(67°). Let's compute:

sin(67°)=0.9205, sin²≈0.8473. Then, 3*0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5*sin²55°: sin55≈0.8192. sin²≈0.6710. 5*0.671≈3.355.

l=3:7*sin²30°=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*sin²13°≈9*(0.22495)^2≈9*0.0506≈0.4554.

Total Σ =1 +2.5419+3.355+1.75+0.4554≈

1+2.5419=3.5419

3.5419+3.355=6.8969

6.8969+1.75=8.6469

8.6469+0.4554=9.1023

Thus, Σ (2l +1) sin²δ_l≈9.1023, so 9.1023.

Which is essentially the same as our previous result for Re[SUM]/ (-k²?), but in our previous original approach, we can see that according to the optical theorem, Im[f(0)]= (1/k) Σ(2l +1) sin²δ_l ≈9.1023/k, which is exactly the same as our first calculation. Therefore, that means our first approach's result 9.1025/k= is wrongwhile applying the calculation properly, using the optical theorem and the sum.

Wait, no, resolution: in the first calculation we found that Im[f(0)]=9.1025/k. But according to the optical theorem Im[f(0)]= (1/k)*9.1023~≈9.1023/k. Therefore, the two approaches agree. Therefore, it must all be correct, but leads to same answer. Therefore, our first calculation (from sum and so on) giving Im[f(0)]≈9.1025/k (≈35.55 fm) is the same as given by optical theorem, since (1/k)*9.1 leads to same result. Therefore, that seems correct.

Wait, then how is that? Because in the first approach:

We computed Im[f(0)] as (-Sum_real)/(2k), but arrived at ≈18.205/(2k)=9.1025/k. But the optical theorem gives Im[f(0)]= Sum sin² (2l+1)/k ≈9.1023/k. Therefore, that allows me to confirm that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude Im[f(0)] is approximately 9.1 divided by k, which is about35.6 fm.

Therefore, conclusion: Im[f(0)]≈35.6 fm. But perhaps need to use exact computation and see if Sum sin² (2l+1) gives the exact value. Wait.

Wait, from the optical theorem approach, we might consider that δ_l are real, so:

In the partial wave expansion, the amplitude is given via S_l = e^{2i delta_l}. When you compute the scattering amplitude’s imaginary part:

Each term (e^{2i delta_l} -1) = e^{i delta_l}*2i sin(delta_l) * [e^{-i delta_l} which would explain another route]

Wait, alternatively, (e^{2i delta_l} -1)= 2i e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l)

Therefore, the scattering amplitude:

f(θ)= 1/(2ik) Sum (2l+1)(e^{2i delta_l}-1) P_l(theta)=1/(2ik) Sum (2l+1)(2i e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l)P_l(theta)=1/k Sum ( (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin delta_l ) P_l(theta) [since 2i/(2ik)=1/k(-i i) Wait, 2i/(2ik)=1/k.

Wait, correct:

(2i)/(2ik)= 1/k*(-i), since (division by i):

(2i)/(2ik)= (i)/(ik)=1/(k) (i/i^2 k)=1/(k)*(-1).

Wait, no, perhaps field:

(2i/(2ik))= (i)/(ik) = 1/k * (i / i )=1/k*1=1/k

Wait, no:

Wait, (multiply numerator and denominator): [2i / (2ik)] = [i/(ik)]= (i /i ) /k= 1/k. So yes, f(theta)=1/k Σ (2l+1)e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) P_l(theta)

Therefore, the forward scattering amplitude:

f(0)=1/k Σ (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l) P_l(0°)

But since P_l(1)=1, this gives 1/k Σ (2l+1) e^{i delta_l} sin(delta_l )

This differs from prior expressions, but it should converge. However, maybe instead of all this, use the conventional optical theorem, which simplifies.

But given that it is proven that Σ (2l +1) sin²( delta_l ) is equal to k Im f(0), both by directly expanding the original expression and via the optical theorem.

Thus the answer is = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) sin²(delta_l )

But for the given phase shifts, the total Σ (2l+1) sin²(delta_l )

As calculated earlier:

l=0:1*(1)^2=1.0

l=1:3*(sin67°)^2≈3*(0.9205)^2≈3*0.847≈2.541

l=2:5*(sin55°)^2≈5*(0.8192)^2≈5*0.671=3.355

l=3:7*(sin30°)^2=7*(0.25)=1.75

l=4:9*(sin13°)^2≈9*(0.22495)^2≈9*0.0506≈0.4554

Sum=1+2.541+3.355+1.75+0.4554≈9.1014

So approximately9.1014. Then times 1/k =9.1014/0.256≈35.5 fm.

But in the elastic scattering with given phase shifts, the total cross section (I suppose it's elastic) is given by 4π/(k²)*Σ (2l +1) sin²delta_l. The fact that Imf(0)=k/(4π) * σ_total comes from optical theorem. So σ_total here would be 4π/k² *9.101 Then this substituted into σ_total, compute Im f(0)=k/(4π)*sigma_total= k/(4π)*(4π*9.101/k²)=9.101/k. which matches.

Thus, all correctness checked. Therefore, the final answer is Im f(0)=9.101/k =9.101/(0.256 fm^{-1})≈35.5 fm.

Therefore, rounding to two decimal places, ~35.5 fm, or ~35.6 fm. Wait, let me calculate precisely:

Using our previous detailed division:

k≈0.2558 fm⁻¹

So, 9.1025 /0.2558 ≈35.58, which≈35.6fm.

Alternatively, use higher precision.

k is 50.508 MeV/c divided by 197.33 MeV·fm/c=50.508/197.33=0.25608...≈0.25608 ym⁻¹.

Then compute 9.1025 divided by 0.25608:

First compute 0.25608*35=8.9628

9.1025 -8.9628= 0.1397

0.25608*0.545=0.25608*0.5=0.12804, 0.25608*0.045=0.0115236

Total 0.12804+0.0115236=0.13956 approximately. So 35 +0.545≈35.545. Therefore≈35.55 fm.

So around35.55 fm, which would round to35.6 fm.

But depends on how precise calculations needed in the answer. If the choices are eminent given the input data, which were stated in degrees as integers, delta0=90, delta1=67，delta2=55, delta3=30, delta4=13

In that case, we can recompute the Σ (2l+1)sin²(delta_l)

Computering more precisely:

For l=0:

(2l+1)=1, delta=90°, sin²(90)=1.0

Thus, 1.0

l=1:

(2l+1)=3, delta=67°

Sin(67)=dot mess then sine squared.

Sin(67 degrees)=sin(1.16937 radians)=

Calculator: sin(67°)=0.92050485345...

sin²=0.8473317206

Multiply by3:3*0.8473317206≈2.5419951618

l=2: (2l+1)=5; delta=55°

Sin(55)=0.81915204428...

Sin²≈0.6710100705

5*0.6710100705=3.3550503525

l=3: 7* sin²30°=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75

l=4:9*sin²13°:

sin13°≈0.2249510543

squared≈0.0506 approx

But precise calculation: sin(13°)=0.22495105434386512...

squared≈0.22495105434386512^2= approx0.22495^2=0.050602...

9*0.050602≈0.455418.

So Σ:1 +2.5419951618 +3.3550503525 +1.75 +0.455418=sum step:

1 +2.541995=3.541995

+3.35505=6.897045

+1.75=8.647045

+0.455418=9.102463。

So, exact Σ≈9.102463。

Thus, Im[f(0)]= (1/k)*9.102463

Compute k： Recalculate k as

K=(momentum)/ħ, Momentum px=?

Given T=50 MeV, m_e c² =0.511 MeV。

Total energy E= T + mc²=50+0.511=50.511 MeV

p c= sqrt(E² -(m c²)^2)=sqrt(50.511²−0.511²)=sqrt( (50.511 -0.511)(50.511 +0.511))=sqrt(50 * 51.022)=sqrt(2551.1 ) ≈50.508 MeV.

Thus, p=50.508 MeV/c. ħc=197.33MeVfm => ħ=197.33MeVfm/c)

Therefore, k= p/ ħ= (50.508MeV/c)/(197.33MeVfm/c ) =50.508 /197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ same as before and:

50.508/197.33= let me compute 197.33*0.256=642,

Wait.

50.508 /197.33≈0.256 indeed. Let's do this division:

197.33*.25=49.3325

50.508-49.3325=1.1755 remaining

1.1755 /197.33≈ 0.00596 (since 197.33*0.005=0.9866, so ≈0.00596)

So total k≈0.25+0.00596≈0.25596 fm⁻¹≈0.256 fm⁻¹

Thus, k=0.255,96 ... ≈0.2560 fm⁻¹

Therefore, Im[f(0)] = 9.102463 /0.25596 ≈35.56 since\

So：

9.102463 /0.256 is over 35.58, but let me compute 9.102463 /0.25596 ⇒ Okay more precisely:

Compute 9.102463 ÷0.25596:

0.25596 ×35= calculate:

0.25596*30=7.6788; 0.25596*5=1.2798; total=7.6788+1.2798=8.9586≤9.102463

Difference is9.102463 -8.9586=0.143863.

Now, how much more is required:

0.25596*x=0.143863 →x=0.143863/0.25596≈0.5615. Thus total value≈35.5615.

Therefore, Im[f(0)]≈35.56 fm.

Therefore, approximately35.6 femtometers.

Therefore, the answer is approximately35.6 fm.

Given that, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is approximately\boxed{35.6~\text{fm}}.


**Final Answer**
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \boxed{35.6~\text{fm}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, given the phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. Hmm... I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Let me recall the formula for the scattering amplitude. 

From what I remember, the scattering amplitude f(θ) in partial wave expansion is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. Specifically, each partial wave contributes a term involving the phase shift δ_l. The general formula should be something like:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ)

Where k is the wave number, θ is the scattering angle, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But in this problem, we're asked about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is the forward direction (θ = 0°). 

Since the incident beam direction corresponds to θ = 0, that simplifies the Legendre polynomials, because P_l(1) = 1 for all l. Let me confirm that—yes, Legendre polynomials evaluated at cosθ = 1 (since θ = 0) give P_l(1) = 1. So in this case, all the P_l(cosθ) terms become 1. Therefore, the scattering amplitude in the forward direction simplifies to:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

But the problem states that we can ignore the phase shifts beyond l=4, since they give δ₀ to δ₄, so we only need to sum up to l=4. So the sum becomes from l=0 to 4.

Therefore, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

However, we need the imaginary part of f(0). Let's first work on simplifying f(0) and then take its imaginary part.

First, let's write out each term of the sum:

For each l from 0 to 4:
Term_l = (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

Therefore, the sum is:

Sum = Term_0 + Term_1 + Term_2 + Term_3 + Term_4

But we need to compute the imaginary part of Sum, then multiply it by 1/(2ik) and take the imaginary part of that.

Wait, no: f(0) = (Sum)/(2ik), so imaginary part of f(0) would be [Im(Sum)] / (2ik), but wait, actually, it's:

Im[f(0)] = Im[ (Sum)/(2ik) ]

Since 1/(2ik) is a complex scalar, let's compute that properly.

First, let’s write 1/(2ik). The wave number k is real for elastic scattering, right? Since we're dealing with a beam of electrons of 50 MeV, which is a real potential (assuming elastic scattering does not involve absorption or inelastic channels, hence the S-matrix is unitary and the phase shifts are real). Therefore, k is real. Therefore, 1/(2ik) is purely imaginary, -i/(2k). So, 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k). Therefore:

Im[f(0)] = Im[ (-i/(2k)) * Sum ]

So, multiplying Sum by -i/(2k), which is an imaginary number (since k is real). 

Therefore, Im[f(0)] would be equal to:

Re[ Sum ] * (-1/(2k)) + Im[ Sum ] * 0 ...Wait, no. Wait, perhaps let me do it step by step. If I have a complex number A = a + ib, and multiply by -i/(2k), then the result is (-i/(2k))(a + ib) = (-i a)/(2k) + (-i^2 b)/(2k) = (-i a)/(2k) + b/(2k), since i² = -1.

Therefore, the real part of (-i/(2k)) * Sum is Re[ (-i/(2k) * Sum ) ] = Re[ b/(2k) - i a/(2k) ] = b/(2k). The imaginary part is (-a)/(2k). But since f(0) = (-i/(2k))* Sum, its real part is Re[f(0)] = Re[ (-i/(2k) Sum ) ] = (Im(Sum))/(2k), and the imaginary part is Im[f(0)] = (- Re(Sum) )/(2k).

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this correctly. Let's note that:

Given f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Sum, then 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k). Therefore, f(0) = (-i)/(2k) * Sum.

Expressing Sum as Sum_real + i Sum_imag, then:

f(0) = (-i/(2k)) (Sum_real + i Sum_imag) ) = (-i Sum_real)/(2k) - i^2 Sum_imag/(2k) = (-i Sum_real)/(2k) + Sum_imag/(2k)

Therefore, the real part of f(0) is Sum_imag/(2k), and the imaginary part of f(0) is (-Sum_real)/(2k). So:

Im[f(0)] = (-Sum_real)/(2k)

Therefore, to compute Im[f(0)], we need to find the real part of the Sum (Sum_real), multiply by -1/(2k) and that gives the result.

So first, compute Sum = Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

Let me compute each term (2l +1)(e^{i 2δ_l} -1). Let's compute each term one by one.

First, for each l from 0 to 4:

l=0: 2*0 + 1 = 1, δ₀ = 90°, so 2δ₀ = 180°, so e^{i 180°} = e^{iπ} = -1. Then, (e^{i2δ₀} -1) = (-1 - 1) = -2.

Therefore, Term0 = 1*(-2) = -2

Similarly for l=1: 2l+1=3, δ₁=67°, so 2δ₁=134°, e^{i134°} = cos134° + i sin134°. Let me compute that.

Wait, 134°: since cos(134°)=cos(180°-46°)= -cos(46°), sin(134°)=sin(46°). So:

Term1 = 3*(cos134° + i sin134° - 1) = 3*(-cos46° - 1 + i sin46°)

Let me calculate numerical values, let me recall that cos46° ≈ 0.6947, sin46°≈0.7193.

So Term1 = 3*( -0.6947 - 1 + i*0.7193 ) = 3*(-1.6947 + 0.7193i) ≈ -5.0841 + 2.1579i

Similarly for l=2: 2l+1=5, δ₂=55°, 2δ₂=110°, e^{i110°} = cos110° +i sin110°.

cos110°=cos(180°-70°)=-cos70°≈ -0.3420, sin110°=sin70°≈0.9397

Term2=5*(-0.3420 + i 0.9397 -1 ) =5*(-1.3420 +0.9397i ) ≈ -6.71 + 4.6985i

l=3: 2l+1=7, δ₃=30°, 2δ₃=60°, e^{i60°}=cos60° + i sin60°=0.5 + i*(√3/2)≈0.5 +i0.8660

Term3=7*(0.5 + i0.8660 -1 ) =7*(-0.5 +i0.8660 )= -3.5 + 6.062i

l=4: 2l+1=9, δ₄=13°, 2δ₄=26°, e^{i26°}=cos26° +i sin26°≈0.8988 +i0.4384

Term4=9*(0.8988 +i0.4384 -1 ) =9*(-0.1012 +i0.4384 )≈-0.9108 +3.9456i

Now, sum all the Terms:

Sum = Term0 + Term1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4

I need to calculate the imaginary component of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction for 50 MeV electrons elastically scattered from a nuclear target. I've been given phase shifts of δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°, with instructions to disregard all other phase shifts. In scattering theory, I recall that the scattering amplitude is connected to these phase shifts.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) in partial wave expansion is expressed as a summation across all angular momentum states, with each partial wave contributing a term involving the phase shift δ_l. The general formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ)

Where k represents the wave number, θ is the scattering angle, and P_l are Legendre polynomials. Since I'm asked about the forward direction (θ = 0°), this simplifies matters because P_l(1) = 1 for all values of l. Therefore, the scattering amplitude in the forward direction becomes:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

Since I can ignore phase shifts beyond l=4, my sum only needs to go from l=0 to l=4:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

To find the imaginary part of f(0), I'll first simplify the expression. Since 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k) for real k (which is the case in elastic scattering), I can write:

f(0) = (-i/(2k)) * Sum

Where Sum = Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1)

If I express Sum as Sum_real + i Sum_imag, then:
f(0) = (-i/(2k))(Sum_real + i Sum_imag) = (-i Sum_real)/(2k) + Sum_imag/(2k)

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is (-Sum_real)/(2k).

Now I need to calculate Sum_real by computing each term (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l}-1) for l=0 to 4:

For l=0: Term0 = 1*(e^{i180°}-1) = 1*(-1-1) = -2

For l=1: Term1 = 3*(e^{i134°}-1) = 3*(-cos46°-1+i sin46°) ≈ 3*(-1.6947+0.7193i) ≈ -5.0841+2.1579i

For l=2: Term2 = 5*(e^{i110°}-1) = 5*(-cos70°+i sin70°-1) = 5*(-1.3420+0.9397i) ≈ -6.71+4.6985i

For l=3: Term3 = 7*(e^{i60°}-1) = 7*(0.5+i(√3/2)-1) = 7*(-0.5+i0.8660) = -3.5+6.062i

For l=4: Term4 = 9*(e^{i26°}-1) = 9*(0.8988+i0.4384-1) = 9*(-0.1012+i0.4384) ≈ -0.9108+3.9456i

Sum = Term0 + Term1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4

The real parts are:
Term0_real = -2
Term1_real ≈ -5.0841

Sure, here is the rephrased text:

I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the direction of the incident beam for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The provided phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°, with all other phase shifts being negligible according to the problem. In scattering theory, the phase shifts are connected to the scattering amplitude. The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) in partial wave expansion involves a summation over all angular momentum states, each contributing a term with the phase shift δ_l. The formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ), 

where k is the wave number, θ the scattering angle, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. For forward scattering (θ = 0°), P_l(cosθ) simplifies to 1 for all l, leading to:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1).

Since phase shifts beyond l=4 are ignored, the sum is limited from l=0 to 4:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1).

For the imaginary part of f(0), we first calculate f(0) and derive its imaginary portion. The factor 1/(2ik) is a complex scalar, explicitly -i/(2k) since k is real for elastic scattering without inelastic effects (indicating the S-matrix is unitary and phase shifts remain real). Therefore:

Im[f(0)] = Im[ (-i/(2k)) * Sum ],

where Sum = Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1).

The product with -i/(2k) yields:

Re[ Sum ] * (-1/(2k)), leading to Im[f(0)] = (- Re(Sum) )/(2k).

Thus, the real part of the Sum multiplied by -1/(2k) provides the imaginary part of f(0). The calculation of each term Term_l = (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) for l from 0 to 4 follows:

l=0: Term0 = 1 * (-2) = -2
l=1: Term1 ≈ -5.0841 + 2.1579i
l=2: Term2 ≈ -6.71 + 4.6985i
l=3: Term3 = -3.5 + 6.062i
l=4: Term4 ≈ -0.9108 + 3.9456i

The real component of the Sum from Terms adds up for the imaginary part calculation through:

Sum_real = Term0_real + Term1_real + Term2_real + Term3_real + Term4_real.

So Sum_real ≈ -18.2049, so Im[f(0)] ≈ (-(-18.2049))/(2k) = 18.2049/(2k)\n\nTherefore, Im[f(0)]≈ 9.10245/k\n\nBut now we need to find k, the wave number. The problem states that the electrons have energy 50 MeV. So we need to compute the wave number k for 50 MeV electrons. \n\nBut wait, electrons are non-relativistic or relativistic at 50 MeV? The rest mass of electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is about 100 times the rest mass, so that would be a relativistic electron. Therefore, we need a relativistic expression for the wave number.\n\nIn relativistic QM, the momentum p is related to the kinetic energy. Wait, but let\'s recall that for a charged particle scattering, the momentum is related to the energy through the standard relativistic equations. The kinetic energy T is related to the total energy E = T + mc². But for electrons, total energy E = γ mc², and momentum p = γ mv. The relation between E and p is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Therefore, p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)/c\n\nWait, the kinetic energy T is E - mc² = (γ -1)mc². So with T = 50 MeV, mc² = 0.511 MeV. Then E = T + mc² ≈50.511 MeV.\n\nThen, p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2)/c ≈ sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c ≈ sqrt( 2551.36 - 0.261 ) / c ≈ sqrt(2551.1)/c ≈50.51/c MeV\n\nBut units are needed here. Actually, since we are in natural units where c=1 for many formulas, but here, when we compute k (which is p/ħ), we might need to get back to SI units. However, perhaps there is an easier way using MeV and fm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the wave number k in terms of the momentum.\n\nWait, since k is the wave number, which is p/ħ. To compute k, we can use the relativistic relation between energy and momentum. Given that the kinetic energy T = 50 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\nE = T + m_e c² = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV\n\np c = sqrt(E² - (m_e c²)^2) = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈sqrt(2551.5 -0.26) ≈sqrt(2551.2)≈50.51 MeV\n\nTherefore, p ≈50.51 MeV/c\n\nTherefore, k = p / ħ ≈ (50.51 MeV/c ) / ħ\n\nBut ħc ≈197.33 MeV·fm\n\nTherefore, k = (50.51 MeV) / (ħ c) ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹≈0.256 fm⁻¹\n\nTherefore, k ≈0.256 fm⁻¹≈0.256 ×10¹⁵ m⁻¹ (since 1 fm=1e-15 m)\n\nBut perhaps k is approximately 0.256 fm⁻¹.\n\nBut to get the numerical value, let\'s compute 50.51 / 197.33: \n\n50 ÷200=0.25, so 50.51 /197.33≈approx 0.256, yes. So k≈0.256 fm⁻¹\n\nTherefore, back to Im[f(0)]≈9.10245/k ≈9.10245 /0.256 fm\n\nBut what are the units for k and for the scattering amplitude? The scattering amplitude\'s units are length. Wait, but in the expression f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Sum, which has units of length. Since [k] is inverse length (fm⁻¹), then 1/k has units of fm, and right. \n\nTherefore, Im[f(0)]≈9.10245 / (2 *0.256) fm.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the result was Im[f(0)] = (Sum_real)/ (2k)\n\nBut before, it was determined that Im[f(0)] = (-Sum_real )/(2k ). Wait, no, wait from earlier.\n\nWait, after reviewing the math here:\n\nSince f(0) = (-i/(2k)) * Sum, then:\n\nExpressed as f(0)= (-i / (2k))*(Sum_real + i Sum_imag) )\n\n= (-i Sum_real)/(2k) + (Sum_imag)/(2k )\n\nTherefore, the real part of f(0) is Sum_imag/(2k), and the imaginary part is -Sum_real/(2k).\n\nBut in the problem, we are being asked for the imaginary part, which is:\n\nIm[f(0)] = -Sum_real/(2k)\n\nBut Sum_real was computed as approximately -18.2049. Thus,\n\nIm[f(0)] ≈ -(-18.2049)/(2k ) ≈18.2049/(2k )≈9.10245 /k.\n\nTherefore, substituting k≈0.256 fm⁻¹,\n\nIm[f(0)]≈9.10245 /0.256≈approx 35.54 fm\n\nWait. 9 divided by0.256≈35.156, 0.10245 /0.256≈0.399, so total≈35.55 fm\n\nTherefore, approximately 35.55 fm.\n\nBut let me do the exact calculation:\n\nk≈50.51 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )≈0.256 fm⁻¹\n\nSo Im[f(0)] ≈9.10245 /0.256≈approximately 35.55 fm.\n\nBut 9.10245 / 0.256 =?\n\n9 /0.256=35.15625\n\n0.10245/0.256≈0.399\n\nThus, 35.15625 +0.399≈35.555, so ≈35.56 fm.\n\nBut just to check:\n\nWait, 35.56 fm? Is that a reasonable answer?\n\nBut let\'s think, the scattering amplitude\'s dimension is length. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem. Wait, the optical theorem states that Im[f(0)] = k/(4π) * σ_total\n\nHmm, let\'s check. No, in the optical theorem, the imaginary part of f(0) is equal to (k σ_total)/(4π)\n\nWait, so:\n\nIm[f(0)] = (k σ_total)/(4π)\n\nBut in our case, computed Im[f(0)] ≈35.55 fm. Let\'s compute (k σ_total)/(4π)≈35.55 fm.\n\nBut we can reverse this, σ_total≈4π Im[f(0)] /k≈4π *35.55 fm /0.256 fm⁻¹ ≈4π*35.55 /0.256 fm²≈4*3.1416*35.55 /0.256≈approx 12.5664*35.55 /0.256≈446.32 /0.256≈1743 fm², which is 1.743 *10⁻²⁶ cm² (since 1 fm²=1e-30 m²=1e-26 cm²). 1.743e-26 cm², or 17.43 barns (since 1 barn=1e-24 cm²). Hmmm, 1.7e-26 cm² is 0.017 barns? Wait, no. Wait, 1 barn is 1e-24 cm², so 1.743e-26 cm² is 0.01743 barns. That\'s a small cross-section. But for nuclear targets with electrons, cross-sections can vary, but not sure if this is correct. Maybe, but maybe there was a miscalculation.\n\nBut since the problem didn\'t ask for the cross-section, but for the imaginary part, let\'s not dwell on that. However, our calculation seems to lead to approximately 35.56 fm. Let\'s make sure that the calculation steps are correct.\n\nWait, let\'s confirm the initial Sum_real:\n\nTerm0: -2\n\nTerm1_real: -5.0841 ≈-5.0841\n\nTerm2_real: -6.71\n\nTerm3_real:-3.5\n\nTerm4_real:-0.9108\n\nSum_real: -2 -5.0841 = -7.0841\n\nThen -7.0841 -6.71 = -13.7941\n\nThen -13.7941 -3.5 = -17.2941\n\nThen -17.2941 -0.9108 ≈-18.2049 yes.\n\nThen Im[f(0)] = (-Sum_real)/(2k)=18.2049/(2*0.256)=18.2049/(0.512)= 18.2049 /0.512≈35.56 fm\n\n35.56 fm is the same as 35.56×10⁻¹⁵ m. So, about 3.5×10⁻¹⁴ m. That seems very small, but considering that nuclear sizes are on the order of femtometers, maybe... Wait, actually, the unit of the scattering amplitude is in femtometers? Because in terms of the amplitude, it\'s length. So given that, 35 fm would be the same as 35×10⁻¹⁵ m, which is small, but in terms of scattering, the cross-section is related to the square of the scattering amplitude. However, given that 35 fm is indeed the result from the Sum, then that might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps miscalculation arises from miscalculations in phases. Let\'s verify the angles again and the cosine / sine computations.\n\nStarting with δ₀=90° leads to Term0=-2 correct.\n\nδ₁=67°, 2δ₁=134°, cos(134°)=cos(180°−46°)=−cos46°≈−0.6947, sin134°=sin46≈0.7193. Then Term1=3*(-0.6947 -1 +i0.7193)=3*(-1.6947 +0.7193i)= -5.0841 +2.1579i. That seems correct.\n\nδ₂=55°, 2δ₂=110°, cosine(110)=cos(180-70)=−cos70≈-0.3420, sin110=sin70≈0.9397. Then Term2=5*(-1.3420 +0.9397i) =−6.71+4.6985i. Correct.\n\nδ₃=30°, so 2*30=60°, cos60=0.5, sin60≈0.8660. So e^{i60}=0.5 +i0.866. Then Term3=7*(0.5 -1 +i0.866)=7*(-0.5 +i0.866)= -3.5 +6.062i. Correct.\n\nδ4=13°, 2*13=26°, cosine26≈0.8988, sin26≈0.4384. So e^{i26}=0.8988 +i0.4384. Term4=9*(0.8988 -1 +i0.4384)=9*(-0.1012 +i0.4384)=−0.9108 +3.9456i. Correct.\n\nSum_real: All terms are calculated correctly, sum up to -18.2049.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary parts of Sum are added correctly to 16.864. So the calculation of Sum = -18.20 +16.86i.\n\nTherefore, Im[f(0)]=(-Sum_real)/(2k)=18.20/(2*0.256)=35.55. So 35.56 fm.\n\nThus, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is approximately 35.56 fm.\n\nHowever, in physics problems, is there any chance that the formula is different?\n\nWait, let me check standard expression. Scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves:\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ )\n\nBecause the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude can be written as\n\nf(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps that formula is different. Let me consult my memory.\n\nYes, in some references, the scattering amplitude is given by:\n\nf(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(S_l -1)P_l(cosθ),\n\nwhere S_l = e^{2iδ_l}.\n\nSo when you rearrange:\n\ne^{2iδ_l} -1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(2) f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l.\n\nWhich is equivalent to (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ).\n\nAlternatively, seem orthogonal.\n\nBut according to this, either formula would yield the same.\n\nSo computation through either form gives same answer. However, let\'s notice in this second expression, ((1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l), in the forward direction (θ=0), all P_l =1, so:\n\nf(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l\n\nThen, the imaginary part of f(0) would be:\n\nIm[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l\n\nBecause Im[e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ] = Im[ (cosδ_l +i sinδ_l) sinδ_l ] = sinδ_l cosδ_l\n\nTherefore, Im[f(0)] according to that formula is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l\n\nBut according to the other formula we used previously, it came out as a certain value. Let\'s check if these agree.\n\nCompute Im[f(0) ] via two different expressions:\n\nFirst expression:\n\nUsing Sum over (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l}-1), then:\n\nIm[f(0)] = (-Sum_real)/(2k). Computed as≈35.56 fm\n\nSecond expression:\n\nUsing Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l multiplied by 1/k.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nFor each l:\n\nIm[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l+1 ) sinδ_l cosδ_l\n\nLet\'s compute each term.\n\nCompute sinδ_l cosδ_l for each l.\n\nFor l=0, δ₀=90°, sin90=1, cos90=0, so term=0\n\nl=1, δ₁=67°, sin67≈0.9205, cos67≈0.3907, sin*cos=0.9205*0.3907≈0.3595. So Term=3*0.3595≈1.0785\n\nl=2, δ₂=55°, sin55≈0.8192, cos55≈0.5736, sin*cos≈0.8192*0.5736≈0.4705. Term=5*0.4705≈2.3525\n\nl=3, δ3=30°, sin30=0.5, cos30≈0.8660, sin*cos≈0.5*0.8660≈0.4330. Term=7*0.4330≈3.031\n\nl=4, δ4=13°, sin13≈0.2249, cos13≈0.9744, sin*cos≈0.2249*0.9744≈0.2191. Term=9*0.2191≈1.9719\n\nSum_ = 0 +1.0785+2.3525+3.031+1.9719=:1.0785+2.3525=3.431; 3.431+3.031=6.462; 6.462+1.9719≈8.4339\n\nThus, Sum≈8.4339\n\nHence, Im[f(0)] = (8.4339)/k ≈8.4339/0.256≈32.99 fm≈33.0 fm.\n\nWait, so discrepancy between two methods: 35.56 vs 33.0 fm. This is concerning, which seems to indicate an error in my earlier approach.\n\nWait, clashing results...so perhaps my first approach has a mistake.\n\nSo according to the second method, the answer would be ≈33.0 fm, but according first method ≈35.5 fm.\n\nWait, why that discrepancy? Two different results based on two different representations.\n\nLet me reconcile both. \n\nFirst approach:\n\nf(0) expressions:\n\nFirst representation: f(0)= (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 )\n\nSecond representation: f(0)= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l\n\nIndeed, if we expand the first one:\n\n(1/(2ik)) [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ] = (1/(2ik))(e^{iδ_l} 2i sinδ_l e^{iδ_l} ) ? \n\nWait, e^{2iδ_l} -1= e^{iδ_l}(e^{iδ_l} -e^{-iδ_l})= e^{iδ_l} 2i sinδ_l.\n\nAh, so:\n\n( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l\n\nTherefore, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) (2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l )\n\n= (1/(2ik))( Σ (2l+1) 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l )\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe 2i in numerator and denominator 2ik cancel, gives (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l\n\nSo the two expressions are consistent.\n\nHence, the 2nd expression: Im[f(0)] is Im[ (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ]\n\nWhich is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) Im[e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ]) = (1/k) Σ(2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l, because:\n\nIm[e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ] = Im( [cosδ_l + i sinδ_l] sinδ_l ) = sinδ_l cosδ_l.\n\nThis gives the 2nd method Im[f(0)] = (1/k)Σ(2l+1)sinδ_l cosδ_l ≈8.4339 /0.256≈32.99 fm≈33.0 fm.\n\nIn the first method it was computed as Im[f(0)]= (-Sum_real) / (2k) ≈18.2049 / (0.512 ) ≈35.56 fm.\n\nThis inconsistency indicates an error in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, in first approach, the Sum was calculated as ≈-18.2049 +16.864i.\n\nMeaning, the real part of Sum is negative. Therefore, Im[f(0)]≈-(-18.2049)/(2k )≈18.2049/0.512≈35.56\n\nBut in second approach with sum≈8.4339, Im[f(0)]≈33.0 fm.\n\nAssuming both expressions should equal, the discrepancy must arise because of an error in the calculations. Let me verify:\n\nWait, let\'s reconcile the two expressions:\n\nIn first method:\n\nSum_real corresponds to Σ(2l+1)( cos2δ_l -1 ), as since (e^{i2δ_l}-1) has real part (cos2δ_l -1) and imaginary part sin2δ_l.\n\nBut according to the expansion of Sum used in first method:\n\nSum=Σ(2l+1)[ (cos2δ_l -1) + i sin2δ_l ]\n\nTherefore, Sum_real = Σ(2l+1)( cos2δ_l -1 )\n\nl=0: δ=90°, cos180 -1= -1 -1= -2; Real=1*(-2)= -2\n\nBut according to the second method, Sum_real in first way is:\n\nSum_real = Σ(2l+1)( cos2δ_l -1 )\n\nIf l’s partial waves are summed.\n\nBut let me compute Sum_real with the (2l+1)(cos2δ_l -1). Let me take all l=0 to 4.\n\nComputing cos2δ_l -1 and multiply by (2l+1 ):\n\nl=0: δ=90°, 2δ=180°, cos180-1=-1-1=-2, term=1*(-2)=-2\n\nl=1: δ=67°, 134°, cos134°≈-cos46≈-0.6947, term=3*(-0.6947 -1 )=3*(-1.6947 )≈-5.0841, CORRECT.\n\nl=2: 55°,2δ=110°, cos110≈-0.3420, term=5*(-0.3420 -1 )=5*(-1.3420 )≈-6.71, square correct.\n\nl=3:δ3=30°, 60°, cos60=0.5, term=7*(0.5 -1)=7*(-0.5 )=-3.5, correct.\n\nl=4: δ=13°,2δ=26°, cos26≈0.8988, term=9*(0.8988 -1 )=9*(-0.1012 )≈-0.9108, correct.\n\nHence Sum_real=-2 -5.0841 -6.71 -3.5 -0.9108≈-18.2049\n\nThus, Sum_real=-18.2049. Therefore, according to first method:\n\nIm[f(0)]= (-Sum_real )/(2k ), leading to 35.56 fm.\n\nSecond method via sinδ_l cosδ_l is:\n\nΣ(2l+1)sinδ_l cosδ_l , which was correctly calculated as≈8.4339, leading to Im[f(0)]≈32.99 fm.\n\nNumerically, these results are different. Hence, m what mistake have I made in first method.\n\nWait, but according to the parametrizations, the two formulas must eventually coincide because f(0) is unique. Therefore, m associated with both calculations must resolve. Therefore, it indicates that my application is not in both.\n\nWait, let\'s pick δ_l=90°.\n\nCompute in two different ways.\n\nFirst way: using the initial formula:\n\nContribution to Im[f(0)] from l=0 in first method is 18.2049/0.512... directly.\n\nWait no, that approach uses the total sum. Let’s take for a single value. For example, take δ_l=π/2, how does both formulas compare.\n\nExample as a test.\n\nLet’s consider a single l=0 phase shift at δ= π/2 (90°), others zero.\n\nThen:\n\nFirst method:\n\nSum Real: from l=0: (1)(cosπ -1 )= -2, other l real parts zero? Sum_real=-2. So Im[f(0)]=(- Sum_real )/(2k )=1/k;\n\nSecond method:\n\nΣ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l : for l=0: sin(90°) cos(90° )=1*0=0; other l=0:0. So total Im[f(0)] =0.\n\nBut First Method says 1/k, and second method says zero. Contradiction.\n\nHmmm. One of my parents implementism wrong?\n\nAh, so critical thinking reveals the two results should match only when considering. Let me address.\n\nWait, in the case that only δ_0=90°, according to optical theorem, in this case:\n\nBut with only s-wave (l=0): the amplitude is given by :\n\nf(0) = (1/(2ik )) * (  (e^{2i δ_0} -1 ) ), i.e., just the l=0 term.\n\nSince e^{2i δ_0} -1 = e^{iπ} -1 = -1 -1= -2.\n\nThus, f(0) = (1/(2ik )) ( -2 ) = (-1)/(ik ) = i/k.\n\nTherefore, f(0)=i/k. Hence Im[f(0)]=1/k.\n\nAccording to second method:\n\nΣ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l only l=0 term is (1)* sin(90°)cos(90°)=1*1*0=0\n\nHence Im[f(0)]=0/k=0 and zero.\n\nBut first method says 1/k.\n\nThis is a problem. Hence, this suggests that my pros differ significantly in general, meaning which formula is correct.\n\nThis needley leads me into deep confusion both approaches not agreeing.\n\nBut rather this indicates an Error either in pass on my decomposition.\n\nWait the key is e^{2i δ_l} -1  in forward direction. Alternatively, etc.Let\'s see With single δ_0=90°, computed in first method leads to Im[f(0)]=1/k, while in second method, it is zero. This discrepancy suggests error in one of beiden analysis.\n\nIn reality, if a particle is mostly scattering strongly in s-wave with phase shift of 90°, which as taught in basic quantum mechanics, gives maximum cross-section. So the scattering amplitude f(0) here should be max. But the first method gives Im[f(0)]=1/k, the cross-section using optical theorem would be (k σ)/4π=1/k→ σ=4π /k².\n\nFor l=0 phase shift of 90°, the total cross sec should be 4π/k², indeed.\n\nBut by explicitly computing the cross-section as |f|² summed over all angles: but since s-wave, |f|²= (1/k²) |e^{iπ/2} sin(π/2)|² ? Eh f(θ) for s-wave is (1/k)(e^{iπ/2}sinπ/2)= (i sinπ/2)/k= i/k. Hence, here the differential cross-section is |i/k |²=1/k², so the total cross-section integrating over all angles:\n\nσ=∫ |f|² dΩ = ∫ 1/k² sinθ dθ dφ=4π/k². Hence, that\'s correct, this maximum cross-section.\n\nWhereas according to the optical theorem, I check Mit protect statement Im[f(0)]= k/(4π)*σ, so\n\nIm[f(0)]= k/(4π) * σ =k/(4π)*(4π/k²)=1/k, which is consistent with the first method.\n\nHence confirmed that in this case, the first method gives correct Im[f(0)]=1/k, and if using second method, summing (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l gives zero, which doesn\'t match.\n\nHence, there\'s an error in assuming that the imaginary part of f(0)= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l 。\n\nTherefore, what\'s the issue here. It\'s possible that there was a miscalculation in the second method explanation.\n\nRecall that for f(θ) as given by second expression as (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)\n\nLa El imaginary part of f(0) is:\n\nIm[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l Re[e^{iδ_l} P_l(1)]\n\nBut P_l(1) =1, all poles are real and equal to 1. Thus,\n\nIm[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l Re[e^{iδ_l} ]\n\nBut Re[e^{iδ_l} ]=cosδ_l , ich bin\n\nTherefore:\n\nIm[f(0)] =∑ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l / k. No, that seems to... No, wait wait: The expression was f(θ)= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l... Then the imaginary part of this is (1/k)Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l Im[e^{iδ_l} ], where Im[e^{iδ_l} ]=sinδ_l . Hence, that implies Im[f(0)]=(1/k)Σ (2l+1 ) sin²δ_l.\n\nWait, but if the amplitude is f= A e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, where the imaginary part of Amplitude is A sinδ_l. Not sure. Let me do this carefully.\n\nWait, if f= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, then each term is complex. Therefore, the imaginary part is sum over (2l+1)/k Im[ e^{iδ_l} ] sinδ_l. But Im[ e^{iδ_l} ] = sinδ_l. This is:\n\nIm[f(0)} Σ (2l+1)/k * sinδ_l * sinδ_l = Σ (2l+1) (sin²δ_l)/k \n\nBut this clearly contradicts the optical theorem when we in previous single mode have something different. However, in single s-wave δ=90°, if we use this, (2l+1)=1, sin²90=1, 1*1/k (delta being s-wave maximum; no, but  oculus theorem says Im[f(0)]=kσ/(4pi). In that case, for l=0, σ=4π/k² and so the sum expression gives 1/k *1=1/k which is equal to oculus theroe, since kσ/(4π) = k*(4π/k²)/(4π) =1/k.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the given phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). 

The scattering amplitude \(f(0)\) in the forward direction (θ = 0°) is given by:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1) \left(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1\right)
\]
where \(k\) is the wave number. The imaginary part of \(f(0)\) is derived from the real part of the sum:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = -\frac{\text{Re}\left(\sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1) \left(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1\right)\right)}{2k}
\]

First, we compute each term in the sum for \(l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\):
- \(l = 0\): \(2\delta_0 = 180^\circ\), \(e^{i180^\circ} = -1\)， term = \(-2\)
- \(l = 1\): \(2\delta_1 = 134^\circ\), calculated real part = \(-5.0841\)
- \(l = 2\): \(2\delta_2 = 110^\circ\), calculated real part = \(-6.71\)
- \(l = 3\): \(2\delta_3 = 60^\circ\), calculated real part = \(-3.5\)
- \(l = 4\): \(2\delta_4 = 26^\circ\), calculated real part = \(-0.9108\)

Summing the real parts:
\[
\text{Re}(Sum) = -2 - 5.0841 - 6.71 - 3.5 - 0.9108 \approx -18.2049
\]

The wave number \(k\) for 50 MeV electrons is calculated using the relativistic relation:
\[
k \approx \frac{50.51 \text{ MeV}}{197.33 \text{ MeV·fm}} \approx 0.256 \text{ fm}^{-1}
\]

Substituting into the formula for \(\text{Im}[f(0)]\):
\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = -\frac{-18.2049}{2 \times 0.256} \approx \frac{18.2049}{0.512} \approx 35.56 \text{ fm}
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

rm2_real ≈ -6.71
Term3_real ≈ -3.5
Term4_real ≈ -0.9108

Sum_real ≈ (-2) + (-5.0841) + (-6.71) + (-3.5) + (-0.9108) ≈ -2 -5.0841 = -7.0841; -7.0841 -6.71 = -13.7941; -13.7941 -3.5 = -17.2941; -17.2941 -0.9108 ≈ -18.2049

Imaginary parts:

Term0_imag =0

Term1_imag ≈2.1579

Term2_imag≈4.6985

Term3_imag≈6.062

Term4_imag≈3.9456

Sum_imag ≈0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 ≈ (2.1579 +4.6985)=6.8564; 6.8564 +6.062=12.9184; 12.9184 +3.9456≈16.864

Therefore, Sum ≈ -18.2049 +16.864i

But wait, but wait: according to the expression for f(0), the imaginary part of f(0) is (-Sum_real)/(2k). So Sum_real ≈ -18.2049, so Im[f(0)] ≈ (-(-18.2049))/(2k) = 18.2049/(2k)

Therefore, Im[f(0)]≈ 9.10245/k

But now we need to find k, the wave number. The problem states that the electrons have energy 50 MeV. So we need to compute the wave number k for 50 MeV electrons. 

But wait, electrons are non-relativistic or relativistic at 50 MeV? The rest mass of electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is about 100 times the rest mass, so that would be a relativistic electron. Therefore, we need a relativistic expression for the wave number.

In relativistic QM, the momentum p is related to the kinetic energy. Wait, but let's recall that for a charged particle scattering, the momentum is related to the energy through the standard relativistic equations. The kinetic energy T is related to the total energy E = T + mc². But for electrons, total energy E = γ mc², and momentum p = γ mv. The relation between E and p is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Therefore, p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)²)/c

Wait, the kinetic energy T is E - mc² = (γ -1)mc². So with T = 50 MeV, mc² = 0.511 MeV. Then E = T + mc² ≈50.511 MeV.

Then, p = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2)/c ≈ sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c ≈ sqrt( 2551.36 - 0.261 ) / c ≈ sqrt(2551.1)/c ≈50.51/c MeV

But units are needed here. Actually, since we are in natural units where c=1 for many formulas, but here, when we compute k (which is p/ħ), we might need to get back to SI units. However, perhaps there is an easier way using MeV and fm.

Alternatively, perhaps express the wave number k in terms of the momentum.

Wait, since k is the wave number, which is p/ħ. To compute k, we can use the relativistic relation between energy and momentum. Given that the kinetic energy T = 50 MeV.

So,

E = T + m_e c² = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV

p c = sqrt(E² - (m_e c²)^2) = sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈sqrt(2551.5 -0.26) ≈sqrt(2551.2)≈50.51 MeV

Therefore, p ≈50.51 MeV/c

Therefore, k = p / ħ ≈ (50.51 MeV/c ) / ħ

But ħc ≈197.33 MeV·fm

Therefore, k = (50.51 MeV) / (ħ c) ) = 50.51 / 197.33 fm⁻¹≈0.256 fm⁻¹

Therefore, k ≈0.256 fm⁻¹≈0.256 ×10¹⁵ m⁻¹ (since 1 fm=1e-15 m)

But perhaps k is approximately 0.256 fm⁻¹.

But to get the numerical value, let's compute 50.51 / 197.33: 

50 ÷200=0.25, so 50.51 /197.33≈approx 0.256, yes. So k≈0.256 fm⁻¹

Therefore, back to Im[f(0)]≈9.10245/k ≈9.10245 /0.256 fm

But what are the units for k and for the scattering amplitude? The scattering amplitude's units are length. Wait, but in the expression f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Sum, which has units of length. Since [k] is inverse length (fm⁻¹), then 1/k has units of fm, and right. 

Therefore, Im[f(0)]≈9.10245 / (2 *0.256) fm.

Wait, no. Wait, the result was Im[f(0)] = (Sum_real)/ (2k)

But before, it was determined that Im[f(0)] = (-Sum_real )/(2k ). Wait, no, wait from earlier.

Wait, after reviewing the math here:

Since f(0) = (-i/(2k)) * Sum, then:

Expressed as f(0)= (-i / (2k))*(Sum_real + i Sum_imag) )

= (-i Sum_real)/(2k) + (Sum_imag)/(2k )

Therefore, the real part of f(0) is Sum_imag/(2k), and the imaginary part is -Sum_real/(2k).

But in the problem, we are being asked for the imaginary part, which is:

Im[f(0)] = -Sum_real/(2k)

But Sum_real was computed as approximately -18.2049. Thus,

Im[f(0)] ≈ -(-18.2049)/(2k ) ≈18.2049/(2k )≈9.10245 /k.

Therefore, substituting k≈0.256 fm⁻¹,

Im[f(0)]≈9.10245 /0.256≈approx 35.54 fm

Wait. 9 divided by0.256≈35.156, 0.10245 /0.256≈0.399, so total≈35.55 fm

Therefore, approximately 35.55 fm.

But let me do the exact calculation:

k≈50.51 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )≈0.256 fm⁻¹

So Im[f(0)] ≈9.10245 /0.256≈approximately 35.55 fm.

But 9.10245 / 0.256 =?

9 /0.256=35.15625

0.10245/0.256≈0.399

Thus, 35.15625 +0.399≈35.555, so ≈35.56 fm.

But just to check:

Wait, 35.56 fm? Is that a reasonable answer?

But let's think, the scattering amplitude's dimension is length. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction is related to the total cross-section via the optical theorem. Wait, the optical theorem states that Im[f(0)] = k/(4π) * σ_total

Hmm, let's check. No, in the optical theorem, the imaginary part of f(0) is equal to (k σ_total)/(4π)

Wait, so:

Im[f(0)] = (k σ_total)/(4π)

But in our case, computed Im[f(0)] ≈35.55 fm. Let's compute (k σ_total)/(4π)≈35.55 fm.

But we can reverse this, σ_total≈4π Im[f(0)] /k≈4π *35.55 fm /0.256 fm⁻¹ ≈4π*35.55 /0.256 fm²≈4*3.1416*35.55 /0.256≈approx 12.5664*35.55 /0.256≈446.32 /0.256≈1743 fm², which is 1.743 *10⁻²⁶ cm² (since 1 fm²=1e-30 m²=1e-26 cm²). 1.743e-26 cm², or 17.43 barns (since 1 barn=1e-24 cm²). Hmmm, 1.7e-26 cm² is 0.017 barns? Wait, no. Wait, 1 barn is 1e-24 cm², so 1.743e-26 cm² is 0.01743 barns. That's a small cross-section. But for nuclear targets with electrons, cross-sections can vary, but not sure if this is correct. Maybe, but maybe there was a miscalculation.

But since the problem didn't ask for the cross-section, but for the imaginary part, let's not dwell on that. However, our calculation seems to lead to approximately 35.56 fm. Let's make sure that the calculation steps are correct.

Wait, let's confirm the initial Sum_real:

Term0: -2

Term1_real: -5.0841 ≈-5.0841

Term2_real: -6.71

Term3_real:-3.5

Term4_real:-0.9108

Sum_real: -2 -5.0841 = -7.0841

Then -7.0841 -6.71 = -13.7941

Then -13.7941 -3.5 = -17.2941

Then -17.2941 -0.9108 ≈-18.2049 yes.

Then Im[f(0)] = (-Sum_real)/(2k)=18.2049/(2*0.256)=18.2049/(0.512)= 18.2049 /0.512≈35.56 fm

35.56 fm is the same as 35.56×10⁻¹⁵ m. So, about 3.5×10⁻¹⁴ m. That seems very small, but considering that nuclear sizes are on the order of femtometers, maybe... Wait, actually, the unit of the scattering amplitude is in femtometers? Because in terms of the amplitude, it's length. So given that, 35 fm would be the same as 35×10⁻¹⁵ m, which is small, but in terms of scattering, the cross-section is related to the square of the scattering amplitude. However, given that 35 fm is indeed the result from the Sum, then that might be acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps miscalculation arises from miscalculations in phases. Let's verify the angles again and the cosine / sine computations.

Starting with δ₀=90° leads to Term0=-2 correct.

δ₁=67°, 2δ₁=134°, cos(134°)=cos(180°−46°)=−cos46°≈−0.6947, sin134°=sin46≈0.7193. Then Term1=3*(-0.6947 -1 +i0.7193)=3*(-1.6947 +0.7193i)= -5.0841 +2.1579i. That seems correct.

δ₂=55°, 2δ₂=110°, cosine(110)=cos(180-70)=−cos70≈-0.3420, sin110=sin70≈0.9397. Then Term2=5*(-1.3420 +0.9397i) =−6.71+4.6985i. Correct.

δ₃=30°, so 2*30=60°, cos60=0.5, sin60≈0.8660. So e^{i60}=0.5 +i0.866. Then Term3=7*(0.5 -1 +i0.866)=7*(-0.5 +i0.866)= -3.5 +6.062i. Correct.

δ4=13°, 2*13=26°, cosine26≈0.8988, sin26≈0.4384. So e^{i26}=0.8988 +i0.4384. Term4=9*(0.8988 -1 +i0.4384)=9*(-0.1012 +i0.4384)=−0.9108 +3.9456i. Correct.

Sum_real: All terms are calculated correctly, sum up to -18.2049.

Similarly, the imaginary parts of Sum are added correctly to 16.864. So the calculation of Sum = -18.20 +16.86i.

Therefore, Im[f(0)]=(-Sum_real)/(2k)=18.20/(2*0.256)=35.55. So 35.56 fm.

Thus, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is approximately 35.56 fm.

However, in physics problems, is there any chance that the formula is different?

Wait, let me check standard expression. Scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ )

Because the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude can be written as

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ )

Alternatively, perhaps that formula is different. Let me consult my memory.

Yes, in some references, the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(S_l -1)P_l(cosθ),

where S_l = e^{2iδ_l}.

So when you rearrange:

e^{2iδ_l} -1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

Therefore,

(2) f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l.

Which is equivalent to (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ).

Alternatively, seem orthogonal.

But according to this, either formula would yield the same.

So computation through either form gives same answer. However, let's notice in this second expression, ((1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l), in the forward direction (θ=0), all P_l =1, so:

f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) would be:

Im[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l

Because Im[e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ] = Im[ (cosδ_l +i sinδ_l) sinδ_l ] = sinδ_l cosδ_l

Therefore, Im[f(0)] according to that formula is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l

But according to the other formula we used previously, it came out as a certain value. Let's check if these agree.

Compute Im[f(0) ] via two different expressions:

First expression:

Using Sum over (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l}-1), then:

Im[f(0)] = (-Sum_real)/(2k). Computed as≈35.56 fm

Second expression:

Using Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l multiplied by 1/k.

Let me compute:

For each l:

Im[f(0)] = (1/k) * Σ (2l+1 ) sinδ_l cosδ_l

Let's compute each term.

Compute sinδ_l cosδ_l for each l.

For l=0, δ₀=90°, sin90=1, cos90=0, so term=0

l=1, δ₁=67°, sin67≈0.9205, cos67≈0.3907, sin*cos=0.9205*0.3907≈0.3595. So Term=3*0.3595≈1.0785

l=2, δ₂=55°, sin55≈0.8192, cos55≈0.5736, sin*cos≈0.8192*0.5736≈0.4705. Term=5*0.4705≈2.3525

l=3, δ3=30°, sin30=0.5, cos30≈0.8660, sin*cos≈0.5*0.8660≈0.4330. Term=7*0.4330≈3.031

l=4, δ4=13°, sin13≈0.2249, cos13≈0.9744, sin*cos≈0.2249*0.9744≈0.2191. Term=9*0.2191≈1.9719

Sum_ = 0 +1.0785+2.3525+3.031+1.9719=:1.0785+2.3525=3.431; 3.431+3.031=6.462; 6.462+1.9719≈8.4339

Thus, Sum≈8.4339

Hence, Im[f(0)] = (8.4339)/k ≈8.4339/0.256≈32.99 fm≈33.0 fm.

Wait, so discrepancy between two methods: 35.56 vs 33.0 fm. This is concerning, which seems to indicate an error in my earlier approach.

Wait, clashing results...so perhaps my first approach has a mistake.

So according to the second method, the answer would be ≈33.0 fm, but according first method ≈35.5 fm.

Wait, why that discrepancy? Two different results based on two different representations.

Let me reconcile both. 

First approach:

f(0) expressions:

First representation: f(0)= (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

Second representation: f(0)= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l

Indeed, if we expand the first one:

(1/(2ik)) [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ] = (1/(2ik))(e^{iδ_l} 2i sinδ_l e^{iδ_l} ) ? 

Wait, e^{2iδ_l} -1= e^{iδ_l}(e^{iδ_l} -e^{-iδ_l})= e^{iδ_l} 2i sinδ_l.

Ah, so:

( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l

Therefore, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) (2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l )

= (1/(2ik))( Σ (2l+1) 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l )

Simplify:

The 2i in numerator and denominator 2ik cancel, gives (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l

So the two expressions are consistent.

Hence, the 2nd expression: Im[f(0)] is Im[ (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ]

Which is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) Im[e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ]) = (1/k) Σ(2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l, because:

Im[e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ] = Im( [cosδ_l + i sinδ_l] sinδ_l ) = sinδ_l cosδ_l.

This gives the 2nd method Im[f(0)] = (1/k)Σ(2l+1)sinδ_l cosδ_l ≈8.4339 /0.256≈32.99 fm≈33.0 fm.

In the first method it was computed as Im[f(0)]= (-Sum_real) / (2k) ≈18.2049 / (0.512 ) ≈35.56 fm.

This inconsistency indicates an error in one of the approaches.

Wait, in first approach, the Sum was calculated as ≈-18.2049 +16.864i.

Meaning, the real part of Sum is negative. Therefore, Im[f(0)]≈-(-18.2049)/(2k )≈18.2049/0.512≈35.56

But in second approach with sum≈8.4339, Im[f(0)]≈33.0 fm.

Assuming both expressions should equal, the discrepancy must arise because of an error in the calculations. Let me verify:

Wait, let's reconcile the two expressions:

In first method:

Sum_real corresponds to Σ(2l+1)( cos2δ_l -1 ), as since (e^{i2δ_l}-1) has real part (cos2δ_l -1) and imaginary part sin2δ_l.

But according to the expansion of Sum used in first method:

Sum=Σ(2l+1)[ (cos2δ_l -1) + i sin2δ_l ]

Therefore, Sum_real = Σ(2l+1)( cos2δ_l -1 )

l=0: δ=90°, cos180 -1= -1 -1= -2; Real=1*(-2)= -2

But according to the second method, Sum_real in first way is:

Sum_real = Σ(2l+1)( cos2δ_l -1 )

If l’s partial waves are summed.

But let me compute Sum_real with the (2l+1)(cos2δ_l -1). Let me take all l=0 to 4.

Computing cos2δ_l -1 and multiply by (2l+1 ):

l=0: δ=90°, 2δ=180°, cos180-1=-1-1=-2, term=1*(-2)=-2

l=1: δ=67°, 134°, cos134°≈-cos46≈-0.6947, term=3*(-0.6947 -1 )=3*(-1.6947 )≈-5.0841, CORRECT.

l=2: 55°,2δ=110°, cos110≈-0.3420, term=5*(-0.3420 -1 )=5*(-1.3420 )≈-6.71, square correct.

l=3:δ3=30°, 60°, cos60=0.5, term=7*(0.5 -1)=7*(-0.5 )=-3.5, correct.

l=4: δ=13°,2δ=26°, cos26≈0.8988, term=9*(0.8988 -1 )=9*(-0.1012 )≈-0.9108, correct.

Hence Sum_real=-2 -5.0841 -6.71 -3.5 -0.9108≈-18.2049

Thus, Sum_real=-18.2049. Therefore, according to first method:

Im[f(0)]= (-Sum_real )/(2k ), leading to 35.56 fm.

Second method via sinδ_l cosδ_l is:

Σ(2l+1)sinδ_l cosδ_l , which was correctly calculated as≈8.4339, leading to Im[f(0)]≈32.99 fm.

Numerically, these results are different. Hence, m what mistake have I made in first method.

Wait, but according to the parametrizations, the two formulas must eventually coincide because f(0) is unique. Therefore, m associated with both calculations must resolve. Therefore, it indicates that my application is not in both.

Wait, let's pick δ_l=90°.

Compute in two different ways.

First way: using the initial formula:

Contribution to Im[f(0)] from l=0 in first method is 18.2049/0.512... directly.

Wait no, that approach uses the total sum. Let’s take for a single value. For example, take δ_l=π/2, how does both formulas compare.

Example as a test.

Let’s consider a single l=0 phase shift at δ= π/2 (90°), others zero.

Then:

First method:

Sum Real: from l=0: (1)(cosπ -1 )= -2, other l real parts zero? Sum_real=-2. So Im[f(0)]=(- Sum_real )/(2k )=1/k;

Second method:

Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l : for l=0: sin(90°) cos(90° )=1*0=0; other l=0:0. So total Im[f(0)] =0.

But First Method says 1/k, and second method says zero. Contradiction.

Hmmm. One of my parents implementism wrong?

Ah, so critical thinking reveals the two results should match only when considering. Let me address.

Wait, in the case that only δ_0=90°, according to optical theorem, in this case:

But with only s-wave (l=0): the amplitude is given by :

f(0) = (1/(2ik )) * (  (e^{2i δ_0} -1 ) ), i.e., just the l=0 term.

Since e^{2i δ_0} -1 = e^{iπ} -1 = -1 -1= -2.

Thus, f(0) = (1/(2ik )) ( -2 ) = (-1)/(ik ) = i/k.

Therefore, f(0)=i/k. Hence Im[f(0)]=1/k.

According to second method:

Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l only l=0 term is (1)* sin(90°)cos(90°)=1*1*0=0

Hence Im[f(0)]=0/k=0 and zero.

But first method says 1/k.

This is a problem. Hence, this suggests that my pros differ significantly in general, meaning which formula is correct.

This needley leads me into deep confusion both approaches not agreeing.

But rather this indicates an Error either in pass on my decomposition.

Wait the key is e^{2i δ_l} -1  in forward direction. Alternatively, etc.Let's see With single δ_0=90°, computed in first method leads to Im[f(0)]=1/k, while in second method, it is zero. This discrepancy suggests error in one of beiden analysis.

In reality, if a particle is mostly scattering strongly in s-wave with phase shift of 90°, which as taught in basic quantum mechanics, gives maximum cross-section. So the scattering amplitude f(0) here should be max. But the first method gives Im[f(0)]=1/k, the cross-section using optical theorem would be (k σ)/4π=1/k→ σ=4π /k².

For l=0 phase shift of 90°, the total cross sec should be 4π/k², indeed.

But by explicitly computing the cross-section as |f|² summed over all angles: but since s-wave, |f|²= (1/k²) |e^{iπ/2} sin(π/2)|² ? Eh f(θ) for s-wave is (1/k)(e^{iπ/2}sinπ/2)= (i sinπ/2)/k= i/k. Hence, here the differential cross-section is |i/k |²=1/k², so the total cross-section integrating over all angles:

σ=∫ |f|² dΩ = ∫ 1/k² sinθ dθ dφ=4π/k². Hence, that's correct, this maximum cross-section.

Whereas according to the optical theorem, I check Mit protect statement Im[f(0)]= k/(4π)*σ, so

Im[f(0)]= k/(4π) * σ =k/(4π)*(4π/k²)=1/k, which is consistent with the first method.

Hence confirmed that in this case, the first method gives correct Im[f(0)]=1/k, and if using second method, summing (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l gives zero, which doesn't match.

Hence, there's an error in assuming that the imaginary part of f(0)= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l 。

Therefore, what's the issue here. It's possible that there was a miscalculation in the second method explanation.

Recall that for f(θ) as given by second expression as (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)

La El imaginary part of f(0) is:

Im[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l Re[e^{iδ_l} P_l(1)]

But P_l(1) =1, all poles are real and equal to 1. Thus,

Im[f(0)] = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l Re[e^{iδ_l} ]

But Re[e^{iδ_l} ]=cosδ_l , ich bin

Therefore:

Im[f(0)] =∑ (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l / k. No, that seems to... No, wait wait: The expression was f(θ)= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l... Then the imaginary part of this is (1/k)Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l Im[e^{iδ_l} ], where Im[e^{iδ_l} ]=sinδ_l . Hence, that implies Im[f(0)]=(1/k)Σ (2l+1 ) sin²δ_l.

Wait, but if the amplitude is f= A e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, where the imaginary part of Amplitude is A sinδ_l. Not sure. Let me do this carefully.

Wait, if f= (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l, then each term is complex. Therefore, the imaginary part is sum over (2l+1)/k Im[ e^{iδ_l} ] sinδ_l. But Im[ e^{iδ_l} ] = sinδ_l. This is:

Im[f(0)} Σ (2l+1)/k * sinδ_l * sinδ_l = Σ (2l+1) (sin²δ_l)/k 

But this clearly contradicts the optical theorem when we in previous single mode have something different. However, in single s-wave δ=90°, if we use this, (2l+1)=1, sin²90=1, 1*1/k (delta being s-wave maximum; no, but  oculus theorem says Im[f(0)]=kσ/(4pi). In that case, for l=0, σ=4π/k² and so the sum expression gives 1/k *1=1/k which is equal to oculus theroe, since kσ/(4π) = k*(4π/k²)/(4π) =1/k. Thus symmetric leads that nova results.

Wait in the only s-wave example at δ=90°, Implied model0} surge antitle both approaches:

First method Im[f(0)] for sizeδ_l=90: (-Sum_real )/(2k )= (-(-2 }(for Sum_real-2} the sum is only l=0's contribution in Sum_real: -2)/(2k )=1/k; second method using serrate( (2l+1) sinδ_l cosδ_l )= for l=0: hellom1. hence), result0. Oben jadi, respectively they give 1/k and zero, but more Prime o'clock on first method is correct.

Hmmm，paradox,gk for some reasonschute mate一either of my second calculation is wrong?

Otherwise，there's a miscalculation when I derived the second method.

Wait, seem the second method in calculating Im[f(0}] is wrong.

The ∑pression f(0)= (1/k)*Σ(2l+1) e^{iδ_l} silnδ_l && http://www.example.comsion that indeed, yes, imaginar part is Re{e^{iδ_l} silnδ_l}? No, mistake here. Wait, no. Hmmm.

For high-energy electrons, their momentum p can be found using relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is the sum of kinetic energy and rest mass energy. But wait, the rest mass of electron is about 0.511 MeV. Since the kinetic energy (50 MeV) is much larger than the rest mass, relativistic effects are significant.\n\nTotal energy E = Kinetic energy + mc² = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV = 50.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.\n\nMomentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)² → pc = √(E² - (mc²)²)\n\npc = √[(50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2] ≈ sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.099) ≈ 50.508 MeV\n\nSo p ≈ 50.508 MeV/c.\n\nTherefore, k = p / ħ, but in natural units where ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so k in [fm⁻¹] is:\n\nk = (50.508 MeV/c) / (ħc) ≈ 50.508 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹\n\nTherefore, 1/k ≈ 3.90625 fm\n\nThen Imag(f(0)) = 18.1049 / (2 * 0.256) ≈ 18.1049 / (0.512) ≈ 35.36 fm.\n\nTherefore, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is approximately 35.4 fm.\n\nBut I should check my units again. Alternatively, perhaps I need not compute k numerically for the answer? Wait, the problem states 50 MeV electrons, but asks for imaginary part possibly in units of length (fm?), so maybe 35.36 fm is the answer.\n\nHowever, the final numerical value was quickly calculated. Let me cross-verify terms:\n\nWas each term summed correctly?\n\nTerm0 real: -2\n\nTerm1: expponent is 2δ₁=134°, so cos(134°) = -cos(46°)≈-0.6947, so e^{i134}= -0.6947 + i0.7193, minus 1 gives -1.6947 +i 0.7193, multiplied by 3: (-5.0841) + i 2.1579\n\nTerm2: 5 * (e^{i110}-1). 2 delta_2=55*2=110°, cos(110°)= -cos(70°)=≈-0.3420, sin(110)= 0.9397. So -1.3420 + i0.9397 multiplied by 5: real part -6.71.\n\nSimilarly, okay. Term3: 7*(e^{i60}-1). e^{i60} is 0.5 +i0.866, subtracting 1: -0.5 +i0.866, multiplied by7: real -3.5, imaginary 6.062.\n\nTerm4: 9*(e^{26} degrees). e^{i26}: cos26≈ 0.8988, sin26≈0.4384. Subtracting 1 gives -0.1012 +0.4384i, multiplied by 9: real≈ -0.9108, im≈ 3.9456.\n\nSum of real parts: -2 -5.0841 ≈-7.0841; -7.0841 -6.71≈ -13.7941; -13.7941 -3.5≈-17.2941; -17.2941 -0.9108≈ -18.2049 (slightly more accurate than my previous -18.1049). So this is about -18.2049.\n\nImaginary parts: For each term:\n\nTerm0: Im component is 0.\n\nTerm1: 2.1579i\n\nTerm2: 4.6985i\n\nTerm3: 6.062i\n\nTerm4: 3.9456i\n\nTotal Im sum ≈ 2.1579+4.6985=6.8564; 6.8564+6.062=12.9184; +3.9456≈16.864. But this gives Sum_imag≈16.864.\n\nHowever, when calculating Im(f(0)), only Sum_real is used. I.e., as per previous result, Im(f(0)) = (-Sum_real)/(2k). So since Sum_real is about -18.2049. Hence Im(f0) = 18.2049/(2k).\n\nWait, but let\'s do the precise calculation again.\n\nFirst, our sum Real_sum = (-18.2049), Imag_sum≈16.864, however in the formula, the imaginary part of f(0) is Sum_imag/(2k) + etc? Wait, let\'s re-examine:\n\nWe have f(0) = (-i/(2k)) * Sum, where Sum has real part Sum_real and im part so Sum_imag.\n\nTherefore, f(0) = (-i/(2k))(Sum_real + i Sum_imag)\n\nDistribute:\n\n= (-i*Sum_real)/(2k) + (-i*i Sum_imag)/(2k)\n\n= (-i Sum_real)/(2k) + (Sum_imag)/(2k)\n\nBut since the imaginary part represents anything multiplied by i, in the expression. The first term has -i, but is it contributing to the real part?\n\nWait, the entire expression is cplx: splitting into real and imaginary:\n\nLet me decompose:\n\nf(0) = [Sum_imag/(2k)] + i [ -Sum_real/(2k) ]\n\nTherefore, the REAL part of f(0)) is Sum_imag/(2k), and the IMAGINARY part is (-Sum_real)/(2k)\n\nTherefore, when they ask for the imaginary part it\'s (-Sum_real)/(2k). So earlier conclusion stands.\n\nSo regardless of Sum_imag, the imaginary part is (-Sum_real)/(2k). So let me be precise here.\n\nThus, the imaginary part of f(0) is [18.2049/(2k)]\n\nCalculating k:\n\nWait, let me recheck electron energy & calculation of k.\n\nElectron Mass is about 0.511 MeV/c². Since the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, which is much larger than rest mass, so we can\'t use non-relativistic approximation. Then, the relativistic relation:\n\nE² = (pc)² + (mc²)²\n\nE here needs to be the total energy. The kinetic energy K = 50 MeV so E = K + mc² ≈ 50 + 0.511 = approx 50.511 MeV, so as computed before.\n\nThen p c = sqrt(E² – (mc²)²) ≈ sqrt((50.511)^2 – (0.511)^2 ) = sqrt(2551.46 -0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.2 )≈ ~50.51 MeV. So p c ≈ 50.51 MeV. Therefore, p ≈ 50.51 / c (MeV/c)\n\nBut in terms of wave number k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / ħ. But to convert this into a unit of fm⁻¹:\n\nUsing natural units, ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Hence, ħ = ħc / c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm/(c). So:\n\nk = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm/(c)) = (50.51/197.33)/fm ≈ 0.2560 fm⁻¹\n\nSo k ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹.\n\nTherefore, (1/(2k)) = 1/(2 * 0.256 ) ≈ 1/0.512 ≈ 1.9531 fm.\n\nTherefore, Sum_real = –18.2049. Hence, Imaginary part of f(0) is (-Sum_real)/(2k) = 18.2049/(2*.256) ≈ 18.2/(0.512) ≈ 35.55 fm.\n\nConsidering Sum_real was approximately -18.2049, so imaginary part is roughly 35.5 fm.\n\nSince the problem didn’t specify significant figures, but original phases were given to whole degrees (except δ2=55, which might be 55.0), presumably we can round to two decimal places.\n\nBut I wonder, in constructive calculations with phase shifts given in integer degrees, maybe each term contributes roughly so...\n\nAlternatively, one could argue that there might be an optical theorem relation here. The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction is related to the total cross-section σ. The formula is Im f(0) = (k / 4π) σ.\n\nBut since this is non-relativistic, probably the semi-classical relation holds. However, though perhaps if I can check it here.\n\nBut in the problem, presumably, without using optical theorem, from partial wave expansion we calculated Im f(0) ≈ 35.5 fm. Similarly, using optical theorem, let\'s cross-check.\n\nBut according to optical theorem:\n\nIm f(0) = (k / 4π) σ\n\nIf we don\'t know σ, we can not compute this. But total cross-section σ here would be given through σ = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin² δ_l (for elastic scattering). But then,\n\nσ [total] = (4π/k²) [Σ (0 to4) (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]\n\nBut since original problem is only concerned with the imaginary part, perhaps whether the answer via different routes is same?\n\nBut in optical theorem result: Im f(0) = k/(4π) σ. If σ calculated via elastic cross-section summation.\n\nBut regardless, given that the problem asks specifically about the calculation through partial wave expansion, probably 35.5 fm is the answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure my calculation for Sum_real is correct:\n\nEach term from l=0:\n\nReal part of (e^{2iδ0} -1) is cos(180°) -1 = -2, multiply by (2*0+1)=1: total real term -2\n\nSimilarly, l=1: 2 delta=134, degrees, cos(134)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)=≈ -0.6947, so Real part of (e^{i134}-1): approx -0.6947 -1= -1.6947)*3 for the coefficient gives Real part^1: approx = -5.0841\n\nSimilarly, l=2: 2 delta=110, Real part: cos(110)= -0.3420-1, multiply by 5: Real term l=2: -1.3420*5=-6.710\n\nl=3: Real part e^{i60}-1=0.5-1= -0.5, multiply by coefficient 7 => -3.5\n\nl=4: Real part e^{i26}-1= (0.8988 -1) *9 =>-0.1012*9 ≈ -0.9108\n\nSo sum them up:\n\n-2 -5.0841 is -7.0841\n\n-7.0841 -6.71 => this would lead to -13.7941\n\n-13.7941 -3.5 => -17.2941\n\nThen -17.2941 -0.9108 =>-18.2049\n\nTherefore, Sum_real≈-18.20\n\nTherefore, Im[f(0)] = 18.20/(2*0.256) ≈ 18.20/0.512≈35.56\n\nSo different approached can get the same decimal precision. So possible answer is approximately 35.6 fm, which is about 35.5 or so.\n\nThus, the answer is around 35.5 fm. But let me translate the .6 to round appropriate. ?\n\nAlternatively, using k as 0.256,Sum_real≈-18.2049, so according to formula the correct Imag part is (18.2049)/(2*0.256)=18.2049/0.512≈35.56 fm.\n\nExpressing as two significant figures. However, considering that the original data provided δ\'s with two sig figs (e.g., δ0=90°, meaning for sure two sig figs. δ2=55 could be two, but the rest have two sig figs.) But maybe to two decimal places.\n\nBut in actual calculations:\n\nIf, using precise exponential values or approximated? For a more accurate number, besides the approximations to trigonometric functions. For instance:\n\nl=1: delta1=67°, so 2delta1=134°, correct is:\n\ncos(134°)= cos(π*134/180). 134°= 180°-46°. So cos(134)= -cos(46°). Calculating cos(46°). Let me get better precision. π=3.1416, so in radians.\n\nBut precise calculation might be time-consuming. Alternatively, we can use calculator values:\n\nPrecise values in calculation:\n\nδ0=90° \n\nfor l=0: (e^{i*180°} -1) = e^{iπ} -1 = -1 -1 = -2. Therefore, contributes -2.\n\nL=1:2δ=134°\n\ncos(134°) is cos(4*π/9)≈ -0.69465837. So e^{i134} -1 = -0.6946 + i0.7193 -1 = -1.6946 +i0.7193. Multiply by3. So real part: 3*(-1.6946)= -5.0838, Im 3*(0.7193)=2.1579.\n\nThus real part: ≈-5.0838\n\nl=2: 2δ2=110° cos(110°)=cos(1.91986 rad)= approx -0.3420201 So (e^(i110°)-1 )= (-0.3420 +i0.9397 -1 )= -1.3420 +i0.9397\n\nMultiply by 5 gives real part: -6.71 , im 4.6985\n\nl=3:2*delta3=60°, e^{i60°}=0.5 +i 0.8660254. Then 0.5 - 1= -0.5. Multiply by7: -3.5\n\nAnd im part 0.8660254*7=6.062178\n\nl=4:2delta4=26°. e^{i26°}=cos(26°)+isin(26°)=0.89879 +i0.43837.\n\nSo cose3. To clarify: Subtracting 1: 0.89879-1= -0.10121, + i0.43837. Multiply by9: real part: 9*(-0.10121)= -0.9109, im 9*0.43837≈3.9453.\n\nThen summing real parts: -2 -5.0838= -7.0838\n\n-7.0838-6.71≈ -13.7938\n\n-13.7938-3.5≈-17.2938\n\n-17.2938-0.9109≈-18.2047\n\nAll right, it still comes to≈-18.2047.\n\nTherefore Sum_real=~ -18.2047 ≈-18.2047. So Sum_real ≈-18.205.\n\nk= p/ħ, and p is approx 50.508 MeV/c, and k=50.508/197.33≈0.2560 fm⁻¹. So 2k=0.512.\n\nThus, imaginary part of f(0)=18.205/0.512≈35.56 fm.\n\nAlright, so 35.56 fm if we use more precise k. Rounding to two decimal places=35.56. Perhaps since the answer is expected to put in a box, maybe they give it as( 35.6 fm) but there could be some missing places.\n\nBut If take into the fact that typically in these scattering experiments phase shifts may have about a degree of uncertainty, this answer could have an error of a few percent perhaps. But the exact answer per calculation is approximately 35.6 fm.\n\nAlternatively, will you use 18.2049/(2*0.256)=18.2049/0.512\n\nCalculate of this. 0.512*35 =17.92, 0.512*35.5=17.92 + 0.512*0.5=17.92+0.256=18.176, the rest 18.2049-18.176=0.0289\n\n0.0289/0.512≈0.056, so total≈35.556=35.56 fm\n\nRounded to two decimal places 35.56 fm, three significant figures would be 35.6 fm.\n\nGiven the level of phase shift data provided (each to two sig figs except 90 and 55), but in those potentially——emmmm, delta0=90° is exact maybe, 67 has two, 55 maybe two, 30 two, 13 two. So all the phase shifts are given either one or two sig figs. But 90° could be 9.0e1 (two), so essential.\n\n若 Indeed, considering that, perhaps the appropriate number of sig figs is two. So rounding 35.56 to two sig figs would yield 36 fm.\n\nBut in the given data, 35.55 is more like three sig figs. Let\'s check. Suppose the phase shifts haveError in the phase shifts:\n\n"measured phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ1=67°, δ₂=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°"\n\nAssuming each is given with two significant figures. For example, 90° - could be two, as written (90.), or one (9 ×10¹). But as all others have two，maybe we can assume two each.\n\nTherefore, if the values are good to two sig figs, then the final answer should be given to two. So 36 fm.\n\nHowever, the exponential calculations:\n\nBut individual trigonometric terms might involve more precise steps.\n\nAlternatively, if we compute this with the original precise phase shifts:\n\nAssuming all phase shifts were given with explicit ± errors, but the problem just gives the values so acts blackbox.\n\nThe given answer calculated through precise Sum_real gives 35.6. If we strictly use two-sig figs is acceptable 36.\n\nBut maybe since there is 4,  yolo. 35.556 would generally box as 35.6.\n\nBut some textbooks or exams often present answers with three figures unless specified otherwise. Let me check original phases for precision.\n\nFor example, the phase shifts are spelled as (d0=90°, d1=67°, d2=55 [if original input was 55, is that 55.0 , so three sig.fig.? Maybe everyone supposes degrees whereas not written decimals.\n\nBut perhaps in a question, it\'s assumed 2 significant figures.\n\nSuppose if I put 36 fm, that\'s 2 s.f., but sum initial real parts had steps like for l=1 and l=2 contributing about-5 and -6.7: that so contributions from partial waves given with implied accuracy.\n\nBut according to calculation using given data, the precise answer is approximately 35.6 fm, to three significant figures.\n\nSince the problem didn\'t specify about how many s.g. are required (6. Use typically Gen PhysCommittee suggests that implicit data (integer given in l= integer are exact but vem. For exampleここ、例えば Problems where you have digits presented:question had degrees written with two-digit sans decimal likely signifiant to two-fig.\n\nApplying that, the answer is three allows mismatches because different terms are given with different precision. But in the calculations it\'s seems the Calculated value is approximately 35.5 fm (18.20/0.512= 35.547, which is ≈ 35.5).\n\nHmmm—calculations summed the real parts of each term given with certain precision:\n\n For l=0, exact ?\n\n yes: exact 90°, so e^{180°i}=exact.\n\nFor othereDsiriso sextro erly, mehh couple aphalinks:\n\nOverall, given the indices and use, the probable safest is to write the answer as≈ 36 fm.\n\nBut let me check with alternative approaches.\n\nWait, Optical theorem states:\n\nIm f(0) = (k/4π) * σ_total\n\nIf we compute σ_total and compare.\n\nBut where σ_total is the sum over all (2l+1)sin²δ_l multiplied by (4π/k²).\n\nAccurate calculation: σ_total=(4π/k^2) Σ(2l+1) sin²δ_l\n\nThusne:\n\nCompute for l=0:1*sin²90 ° =1\n\nl=1:3 sin²67≈3*(0.9205)^2≈3*0.8473~ 2.5419\n\nl=2:5 sin²55≈5*(0.8192)^2≈5*0.6711≈3.3555\n\nl=3:7 sin²30°=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75\n\nl=4:9 sin²13≈9*(0.2249)^2≈9*0.0506≈0.4554\n\nSum of these:\n\n1+2.5419=3.5419 +3.3555=6.8974 +1.75=8.6474 +0.4554=9.1028\n\nσ_total = (4π/k²)*9.1028\n\nAnsw.σ_total=(4π*9.1028)/(k²)\n\nTherefore, σ_total ≈(36.642)/(0.256²) fm² ≈36.642 /0.0655 ≈559.5 fm²\n\nTherefore: Im f(0)=k/(4π) *σ_total=(0.256 fm^{-1}/ (4π))*559.5 fm²≈0.256*559.5/(4π)≈0.256*(139.875)/π≈\n\nCalculate numeraical:\n\n0.256*139.875 approx=35.808\n\nDivide by π≈3.1416:35.808/3.1416≈11.40\n\nBut this would if Imaginary partOpt thou recipe theorem actually were being cálculoEL?\n\nBut previously i have got f im part=35.5 fm whereas here   35.8 divided by " .\n\nBut wait, wtf.\n\nWait.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the given phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). 

**Step 1: Scattering Amplitude in Forward Direction**
The scattering amplitude in the forward direction (\(\theta = 0^\circ\)) is given by:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) \left(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1\right)
\]
Since only phase shifts up to \(l = 4\) are considered, the sum is truncated there:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1) \left(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1\right)
\]

**Step 2: Imaginary Part of the Scattering Amplitude**
The imaginary part of \(f(0)\) is derived from the real parts of the terms in the sum. The key steps involve calculating the real parts of \((e^{2i\delta_l} - 1)\) for each \(l\) and summing them.

**Calculations for Each Phase Shift:**
- **For \(l = 0\):** \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(e^{i180^\circ} - 1 = -2\)
- **For \(l = 1\):** \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), Real part of \(3(e^{i134^\circ} - 1) \approx -5.0841\)
- **For \(l = 2\):** \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), Real part of \(5(e^{i110^\circ} - 1) \approx -6.71\)
- **For \(l = 3\):** \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), Real part of \(7(e^{i60^\circ} - 1) \approx -3.5\)
- **For \(l = 4\):** \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\), Real part of \(9(e^{i26^\circ} - 1) \approx -0.9108\)

**Summing Real Parts:**
\[
\text{Sum}_{\text{real}} = -2 - 5.0841 - 6.71 - 3.5 - 0.9108 = -18.2049
\]

**Wave Number Calculation:**
The wave number \(k\) is calculated using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:
\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2}}{\hbar c} \approx \frac{50.508 \, \text{MeV}}{197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm}} \approx 0.256 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

**Imaginary Part of \(f(0)\):**
\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{-\text{Sum}_{\text{real}}}{2k} = \frac{18.2049}{2 \times 0.256} \approx 35.56 \, \text{fm}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is approximately:
\[
\boxed{35.6 \, \text{fm}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning


Term2_real ≈ -6.71
Term3_real ≈ -3.5
Term4_real ≈ -0.9108

Sum_real ≈ (-2) + (-5.0841) + (-6.71) + (-3.5) + (-0.9108) ≈ -18.1049

So the imaginary part of f(0) would be (-Sum_real)/(2k) = (18.1049)/(2k)

Now I need to compute the wave number k.

Given the electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. For high-energy electrons, their momentum p can be found using relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is the sum of kinetic energy and rest mass energy. But wait, the rest mass of electron is about 0.511 MeV. Since the kinetic energy (50 MeV) is much larger than the rest mass, relativistic effects are significant.

Total energy E = Kinetic energy + mc² = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV = 50.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.

Momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)² → pc = √(E² - (mc²)²)

pc = √[(50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2] ≈ sqrt(2551.36 - 0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.099) ≈ 50.508 MeV

So p ≈ 50.508 MeV/c.

Therefore, k = p / ħ, but in natural units where ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so k in [fm⁻¹] is:

k = (50.508 MeV/c) / (ħc) ≈ 50.508 / 197.33 ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹

Therefore, 1/k ≈ 3.90625 fm

Then Imag(f(0)) = 18.1049 / (2 * 0.256) ≈ 18.1049 / (0.512) ≈ 35.36 fm.

Therefore, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is approximately 35.4 fm.

But I should check my units again. Alternatively, perhaps I need not compute k numerically for the answer? Wait, the problem states 50 MeV electrons, but asks for imaginary part possibly in units of length (fm?), so maybe 35.36 fm is the answer.

However, the final numerical value was quickly calculated. Let me cross-verify terms:

Was each term summed correctly?

Term0 real: -2

Term1: expponent is 2δ₁=134°, so cos(134°) = -cos(46°)≈-0.6947, so e^{i134}= -0.6947 + i0.7193, minus 1 gives -1.6947 +i 0.7193, multiplied by 3: (-5.0841) + i 2.1579

Term2: 5 * (e^{i110}-1). 2 delta_2=55*2=110°, cos(110°)= -cos(70°)=≈-0.3420, sin(110)= 0.9397. So -1.3420 + i0.9397 multiplied by 5: real part -6.71.

Similarly, okay. Term3: 7*(e^{i60}-1). e^{i60} is 0.5 +i0.866, subtracting 1: -0.5 +i0.866, multiplied by7: real -3.5, imaginary 6.062.

Term4: 9*(e^{26} degrees). e^{i26}: cos26≈ 0.8988, sin26≈0.4384. Subtracting 1 gives -0.1012 +0.4384i, multiplied by 9: real≈ -0.9108, im≈ 3.9456.

Sum of real parts: -2 -5.0841 ≈-7.0841; -7.0841 -6.71≈ -13.7941; -13.7941 -3.5≈-17.2941; -17.2941 -0.9108≈ -18.2049 (slightly more accurate than my previous -18.1049). So this is about -18.2049.

Imaginary parts: For each term:

Term0: Im component is 0.

Term1: 2.1579i

Term2: 4.6985i

Term3: 6.062i

Term4: 3.9456i

Total Im sum ≈ 2.1579+4.6985=6.8564; 6.8564+6.062=12.9184; +3.9456≈16.864. But this gives Sum_imag≈16.864.

However, when calculating Im(f(0)), only Sum_real is used. I.e., as per previous result, Im(f(0)) = (-Sum_real)/(2k). So since Sum_real is about -18.2049. Hence Im(f0) = 18.2049/(2k).

Wait, but let's do the precise calculation again.

First, our sum Real_sum = (-18.2049), Imag_sum≈16.864, however in the formula, the imaginary part of f(0) is Sum_imag/(2k) + etc? Wait, let's re-examine:

We have f(0) = (-i/(2k)) * Sum, where Sum has real part Sum_real and im part so Sum_imag.

Therefore, f(0) = (-i/(2k))(Sum_real + i Sum_imag)

Distribute:

= (-i*Sum_real)/(2k) + (-i*i Sum_imag)/(2k)

= (-i Sum_real)/(2k) + (Sum_imag)/(2k)

But since the imaginary part represents anything multiplied by i, in the expression. The first term has -i, but is it contributing to the real part?

Wait, the entire expression is cplx: splitting into real and imaginary:

Let me decompose:

f(0) = [Sum_imag/(2k)] + i [ -Sum_real/(2k) ]

Therefore, the REAL part of f(0)) is Sum_imag/(2k), and the IMAGINARY part is (-Sum_real)/(2k)

Therefore, when they ask for the imaginary part it's (-Sum_real)/(2k). So earlier conclusion stands.

So regardless of Sum_imag, the imaginary part is (-Sum_real)/(2k). So let me be precise here.

Thus, the imaginary part of f(0) is [18.2049/(2k)]

Calculating k:

Wait, let me recheck electron energy & calculation of k.

Electron Mass is about 0.511 MeV/c². Since the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, which is much larger than rest mass, so we can't use non-relativistic approximation. Then, the relativistic relation:

E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²

E here needs to be the total energy. The kinetic energy K = 50 MeV so E = K + mc² ≈ 50 + 0.511 = approx 50.511 MeV, so as computed before.

Then p c = sqrt(E² – (mc²)²) ≈ sqrt((50.511)^2 – (0.511)^2 ) = sqrt(2551.46 -0.261) ≈ sqrt(2551.2 )≈ ~50.51 MeV. So p c ≈ 50.51 MeV. Therefore, p ≈ 50.51 / c (MeV/c)

But in terms of wave number k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / ħ. But to convert this into a unit of fm⁻¹:

Using natural units, ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm. Hence, ħ = ħc / c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm/(c). So:

k = p / ħ = (50.51 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm/(c)) = (50.51/197.33)/fm ≈ 0.2560 fm⁻¹

So k ≈ 0.256 fm⁻¹.

Therefore, (1/(2k)) = 1/(2 * 0.256 ) ≈ 1/0.512 ≈ 1.9531 fm.

Therefore, Sum_real = –18.2049. Hence, Imaginary part of f(0) is (-Sum_real)/(2k) = 18.2049/(2*.256) ≈ 18.2/(0.512) ≈ 35.55 fm.

Considering Sum_real was approximately -18.2049, so imaginary part is roughly 35.5 fm.

Since the problem didn’t specify significant figures, but original phases were given to whole degrees (except δ2=55, which might be 55.0), presumably we can round to two decimal places.

But I wonder, in constructive calculations with phase shifts given in integer degrees, maybe each term contributes roughly so...

Alternatively, one could argue that there might be an optical theorem relation here. The optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the forward direction is related to the total cross-section σ. The formula is Im f(0) = (k / 4π) σ.

But since this is non-relativistic, probably the semi-classical relation holds. However, though perhaps if I can check it here.

But in the problem, presumably, without using optical theorem, from partial wave expansion we calculated Im f(0) ≈ 35.5 fm. Similarly, using optical theorem, let's cross-check.

But according to optical theorem:

Im f(0) = (k / 4π) σ

If we don't know σ, we can not compute this. But total cross-section σ here would be given through σ = (4π/k²) Σ (2l +1) sin² δ_l (for elastic scattering). But then,

σ [total] = (4π/k²) [Σ (0 to4) (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]

But since original problem is only concerned with the imaginary part, perhaps whether the answer via different routes is same?

But in optical theorem result: Im f(0) = k/(4π) σ. If σ calculated via elastic cross-section summation.

But regardless, given that the problem asks specifically about the calculation through partial wave expansion, probably 35.5 fm is the answer.

Wait, let me make sure my calculation for Sum_real is correct:

Each term from l=0:

Real part of (e^{2iδ0} -1) is cos(180°) -1 = -2, multiply by (2*0+1)=1: total real term -2

Similarly, l=1: 2 delta=134, degrees, cos(134)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)=≈ -0.6947, so Real part of (e^{i134}-1): approx -0.6947 -1= -1.6947)*3 for the coefficient gives Real part^1: approx = -5.0841

Similarly, l=2: 2 delta=110, Real part: cos(110)= -0.3420-1, multiply by 5: Real term l=2: -1.3420*5=-6.710

l=3: Real part e^{i60}-1=0.5-1= -0.5, multiply by coefficient 7 => -3.5

l=4: Real part e^{i26}-1= (0.8988 -1) *9 =>-0.1012*9 ≈ -0.9108

So sum them up:

-2 -5.0841 is -7.0841

-7.0841 -6.71 => this would lead to -13.7941

-13.7941 -3.5 => -17.2941

Then -17.2941 -0.9108 =>-18.2049

Therefore, Sum_real≈-18.20

Therefore, Im[f(0)] = 18.20/(2*0.256) ≈ 18.20/0.512≈35.56

So different approached can get the same decimal precision. So possible answer is approximately 35.6 fm, which is about 35.5 or so.

Thus, the answer is around 35.5 fm. But let me translate the .6 to round appropriate. ?

Alternatively, using k as 0.256,Sum_real≈-18.2049, so according to formula the correct Imag part is (18.2049)/(2*0.256)=18.2049/0.512≈35.56 fm.

Expressing as two significant figures. However, considering that the original data provided δ's with two sig figs (e.g., δ0=90°, meaning for sure two sig figs. δ2=55 could be two, but the rest have two sig figs.) But maybe to two decimal places.

But in actual calculations:

If, using precise exponential values or approximated? For a more accurate number, besides the approximations to trigonometric functions. For instance:

l=1: delta1=67°, so 2delta1=134°, correct is:

cos(134°)= cos(π*134/180). 134°= 180°-46°. So cos(134)= -cos(46°). Calculating cos(46°). Let me get better precision. π=3.1416, so in radians.

But precise calculation might be time-consuming. Alternatively, we can use calculator values:

Precise values in calculation:

δ0=90° 

for l=0: (e^{i*180°} -1) = e^{iπ} -1 = -1 -1 = -2. Therefore, contributes -2.

L=1:2δ=134°

cos(134°) is cos(4*π/9)≈ -0.69465837. So e^{i134} -1 = -0.6946 + i0.7193 -1 = -1.6946 +i0.7193. Multiply by3. So real part: 3*(-1.6946)= -5.0838, Im 3*(0.7193)=2.1579.

Thus real part: ≈-5.0838

l=2: 2δ2=110° cos(110°)=cos(1.91986 rad)= approx -0.3420201 So (e^(i110°)-1 )= (-0.3420 +i0.9397 -1 )= -1.3420 +i0.9397

Multiply by 5 gives real part: -6.71 , im 4.6985

l=3:2*delta3=60°, e^{i60°}=0.5 +i 0.8660254. Then 0.5 - 1= -0.5. Multiply by7: -3.5

And im part 0.8660254*7=6.062178

l=4:2delta4=26°. e^{i26°}=cos(26°)+isin(26°)=0.89879 +i0.43837.

So cose3. To clarify: Subtracting 1: 0.89879-1= -0.10121, + i0.43837. Multiply by9: real part: 9*(-0.10121)= -0.9109, im 9*0.43837≈3.9453.

Then summing real parts: -2 -5.0838= -7.0838

-7.0838-6.71≈ -13.7938

-13.7938-3.5≈-17.2938

-17.2938-0.9109≈-18.2047

All right, it still comes to≈-18.2047.

Therefore Sum_real=~ -18.2047 ≈-18.2047. So Sum_real ≈-18.205.

k= p/ħ, and p is approx 50.508 MeV/c, and k=50.508/197.33≈0.2560 fm⁻¹. So 2k=0.512.

Thus, imaginary part of f(0)=18.205/0.512≈35.56 fm.

Alright, so 35.56 fm if we use more precise k. Rounding to two decimal places=35.56. Perhaps since the answer is expected to put in a box, maybe they give it as( 35.6 fm) but there could be some missing places.

But If take into the fact that typically in these scattering experiments phase shifts may have about a degree of uncertainty, this answer could have an error of a few percent perhaps. But the exact answer per calculation is approximately 35.6 fm.

Alternatively, will you use 18.2049/(2*0.256)=18.2049/0.512

Calculate of this. 0.512*35 =17.92, 0.512*35.5=17.92 + 0.512*0.5=17.92+0.256=18.176, the rest 18.2049-18.176=0.0289

0.0289/0.512≈0.056, so total≈35.556=35.56 fm

Rounded to two decimal places 35.56 fm, three significant figures would be 35.6 fm.

Given the level of phase shift data provided (each to two sig figs except 90 and 55), but in those potentially——emmmm, delta0=90° is exact maybe, 67 has two, 55 maybe two, 30 two, 13 two. So all the phase shifts are given either one or two sig figs. But 90° could be 9.0e1 (two), so essential.

若 Indeed, considering that, perhaps the appropriate number of sig figs is two. So rounding 35.56 to two sig figs would yield 36 fm.

But in the given data, 35.55 is more like three sig figs. Let's check. Suppose the phase shifts haveError in the phase shifts:

"measured phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ1=67°, δ₂=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°"

Assuming each is given with two significant figures. For example, 90° - could be two, as written (90.), or one (9 ×10¹). But as all others have two，maybe we can assume two each.

Therefore, if the values are good to two sig figs, then the final answer should be given to two. So 36 fm.

However, the exponential calculations:

But individual trigonometric terms might involve more precise steps.

Alternatively, if we compute this with the original precise phase shifts:

Assuming all phase shifts were given with explicit ± errors, but the problem just gives the values so acts blackbox.

The given answer calculated through precise Sum_real gives 35.6. If we strictly use two-sig figs is acceptable 36.

But maybe since there is 4,  yolo. 35.556 would generally box as 35.6.

But some textbooks or exams often present answers with three figures unless specified otherwise. Let me check original phases for precision.

For example, the phase shifts are spelled as (d0=90°, d1=67°, d2=55 [if original input was 55, is that 55.0 , so three sig.fig.? Maybe everyone supposes degrees whereas not written decimals.

But perhaps in a question, it's assumed 2 significant figures.

Suppose if I put 36 fm, that's 2 s.f., but sum initial real parts had steps like for l=1 and l=2 contributing about-5 and -6.7: that so contributions from partial waves given with implied accuracy.

But according to calculation using given data, the precise answer is approximately 35.6 fm, to three significant figures.

Since the problem didn't specify about how many s.g. are required (6. Use typically Gen PhysCommittee suggests that implicit data (integer given in l= integer are exact but vem. For exampleここ、例えば Problems where you have digits presented:question had degrees written with two-digit sans decimal likely signifiant to two-fig.

Applying that, the answer is three allows mismatches because different terms are given with different precision. But in the calculations it's seems the Calculated value is approximately 35.5 fm (18.20/0.512= 35.547, which is ≈ 35.5).

Hmmm—calculations summed the real parts of each term given with certain precision:

 For l=0, exact ?

 yes: exact 90°, so e^{180°i}=exact.

For othereDsiriso sextro erly, mehh couple aphalinks:

Overall, given the indices and use, the probable safest is to write the answer as≈ 36 fm.

But let me check with alternative approaches.

Wait, Optical theorem states:

Im f(0) = (k/4π) * σ_total

If we compute σ_total and compare.

But where σ_total is the sum over all (2l+1)sin²δ_l multiplied by (4π/k²).

Accurate calculation: σ_total=(4π/k^2) Σ(2l+1) sin²δ_l

Thusne:

Compute for l=0:1*sin²90 ° =1

l=1:3 sin²67≈3*(0.9205)^2≈3*0.8473~ 2.5419

l=2:5 sin²55≈5*(0.8192)^2≈5*0.6711≈3.3555

l=3:7 sin²30°=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75

l=4:9 sin²13≈9*(0.2249)^2≈9*0.0506≈0.4554

Sum of these:

1+2.5419=3.5419 +3.3555=6.8974 +1.75=8.6474 +0.4554=9.1028

σ_total = (4π/k²)*9.1028

Answ.σ_total=(4π*9.1028)/(k²)

Therefore, σ_total ≈(36.642)/(0.256²) fm² ≈36.642 /0.0655 ≈559.5 fm²

Therefore: Im f(0)=k/(4π) *σ_total=(0.256 fm^{-1}/ (4π))*559.5 fm²≈0.256*559.5/(4π)≈0.256*(139.875)/π≈

Calculate numeraical:

0.256*139.875 approx=35.808

Divide by π≈3.1416:35.808/3.1416≈11.40

But this would if Imaginary partOpt thou recipe theorem actually were being cálculoEL?

But previously i have got f im part=35.5 fm whereas here   35.8 divided by " .

But wait, wtf.

Wait. By optical theorem,Im f(0)=kσ_total/(4π)

Upon evaluating sigmaTotal= (4 pi / k^2 ) Sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l.

Thus,

Im f(so e.o. theorem: Im f(0)= k sigma_total/(4 pi )=k*(4 pi /k^2) SUM/~(4pi blah:

Cancel cancels:

Im f(0)= [k/(4 pi)] *[4 pi/k² sumratl] ]= sum' (over l terms)/k.

Therefore: ( {
Wait wait, wrong:

Let me redo:

sigma_total= (4 π /k²) * Sum (2l+1) sin² delta_l.

 Imf(0)= (k / 4π) sigma_total = (k /4π)*(4 π/k²) sum (2l+1 sin² delta_l)= sum/k.

Hence, Im f(0)= [ Sum (2l +1) sin² delta_l ] / k.

Wait. Alternatively:for elastic scattering:

optical theorem implies:

Im f(0)= k⌺ th(i'm wrong thinking) No. Wait Okay:

In the optical theorem:

σ_total = \frac{4π}{k} Im f(0)

Therefore:

Im f(0) = k σ_total/4π

But since σ_total includes all the summations. So if using summing the sigmas as forelastic:

spin, if one is ,total this is pure elastisc!

But since the question is about elastic scattering, the total cross section is given by sum (4π/k^2) (2l +1 ) sin² deltal.

Hence then:

Tenetica:

Im不稳定where？

wait this step:

Using optical theorem in 3D quantum s, for elastic scattering, in racah equation: the optical theorem:

Im f(0)= (k/4π) σ_total.

Butσ_total= sum sigma_l = (4pi/k²) Σ (2l + Ndarray物(), but for inflarity, in eversionial.el.( no inelastic.

But in elastic scattering, yes.

Alright so Compute sum (2l +1 ) sin^2 delta_l:

Computed before: 1 +3 sin^267 +5 sin^255 +7 sin^230 +9 sin^213.

Gives total summed num = 9.1028, as before.

 hence Im f(0)= (9.1028 ) / k ≈9.1028 /0.256 ≈35.55 fm. Which coincides with our previous calculation.

Aha! So the optical theorem tells us thatImf(0)= [Sum (2l+1) sin^2 delta_l]/k. Which is equivalent to our calculation.

Because (sum (2l+1)(e^{2i delta_l} -1 )) , the real part is sum (2l+1)((cos2delta_l -1) ) and the imaginary part? Yo, converting previous formulation:

 Fourier l=0 to 4.

Imaginary part comes from Sum (2l+1 ) sin(2delta_l )

But

In the explicit f(0) done earlier Using the exact formula for Im f(0), such as part Sum（ - realization of - their real parts obfuscated.

But however, alternatively computation via Optical theorem leads us within same result:

The key being that Im f(0)=(sigma_total krpi intense? No, according to optical theorem:

Wait Excuse me, revisiting the Optical Theorem.

Assuming that,

SI units, but in scattering theory (non-relativistic), the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is σ_total = (4π/k) Im f(0)

Therefore,

Im f(0) = (k/(4π )) * σ_total

But σ_total in elastic scattering is sum over partial cross-sections:

σ_total= Σ σ_l = Σ [4π/k² (2l +1) sin² δ_l ]

then,Im f(0)= k/(4π)* Σ [4π/k² (2l+1)sin² δ_l ] = Σ [ (4π/k² (2l+1) sin² δ_l) * k/(4π) ]= Σ [ (2l+1 sin^2deltaL)/k )

Therefore Im f(0)= [ Σ(2l +1 ) sin² δ_l ] / k

Which leads to 9.1028 /0.256≈35.55fm.,The same as we calculated before.

Hence, using either Optical theorem or partial wave expansion method obtains same result, gave≈35.5 fm. Which convinces that our answer is correct.

For elastic scattering, σ_elastic = (4π/k²) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin²δ_l (since for each l, the scattering amplitude contributes sin²δ_l to the cross-section). But wait, the question is about the total cross-section. If there\'s no inelastic scattering, σ_total = σ_elastic, so in such cases, Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * σ_elastic = (k/(4π)) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l) ) = (Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l ) / k.\n\nThus, Im f(0) = Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l / k.

Given that:\n\nFrom sum over f(0) partial waves:\n\nTerm_l = (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) - 1 ) = (2l+1)[ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]\n\nSumming Term_l over l=0 to4, the Real part of Sum is Σ (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l)-1) and Imag part is Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).\n\nIm[f(0)] = (1/(2ik)) * Sum =.\n\nExpressed as ( -i/(2k) )*(Real Sum + i Imag Sum ) = ( -i/(2k) )(Real Sum) + (1/(2k) )Imag Sum.\n\nThus, Im[ f(0) ] = ( - Real Sum )/(2k ).\n\nBut Real Sum = Σ (2l +1)( cos(2δ_l) −1 )\n\nWhich can compute explicitly.\n\nInstead of trying other methods, proceed step-by-step.\n\nFirst, For each l from 0 to 4:\n\nCompute (2l +1)*(cos(2δ_l) −1 )\n\nnominated into terms.\n\nGiven δ_0 = 90°, so 2δ_0 = 180°, cos 180° = -1, hence Term0 real part:1*( -1 -1 ) = -2.\n\nl=0: 2*0 +1=1; δ=90°, 2δ=180°, cos(180)= -1; 1*( -1 -1 )= -2.\n\nl=1: delta=67°, 2delta=134°, cos(134)=cos(180-46)= -cos46 ≈ -0.69465837 (if cos46≈0.69465837)\n\nHence, (2*1 +1)=3 ; 3*( -0.69465837 −1 )=3*( -1.69465837 )≈ -5.08397512.\n\nl=2: delta=55°, 2delta=110°, cos(110°)=cos(180−70)= −cos70≈−0.3420.\n\nSo, (2*2 +1)=5*( −0.3420 −1 )=5*(−1.3420)=−6.71.\n\nl=3: delta=30°, 2delta=60°, cos60=0.5;(this a typo, 2delta is 60°, cos60=0.5 => 2l+1=7*(0.5 -1) cos(60)=0.5, cos(60) –1 =−0.5. Then Term3_real=(2l+1)*(0.5−1) =7*(−0.5)=−3.5.\n\nl=4: delta=13°, 2delta=26°; cos(26°)≈0.898794046.\n\nSo, compute cos(26°)= approx ≅0.8988.\n\n\nHence, Term4_real= (2*4 +1)*(0.8988 -1)=9*(-0.1012)= -0.9108.\n\nHence, sum all they terms:\n\n-2 (l=0) −5.08397512 (l=1) −6.71 (l=2) −3.5 (l=3) −0.9108 (l=4) ≈(−2) + (−5.084) + (−6.71) + (−3.5) + (−0.9108) ≈−2−5.084=−7.084−6.71=−13.794−3.5=−17.294−0.9108≈−18.2048.\n\nThus, Real Sum≈−18.2048.\n\nThus, Im[f(0)] = (- Real Sum) / (2k) = (18.2048)/(2k) ≈9.1024/k.\n\nNow, we need to compute k. Since electrons are at 50 MeV. Given relativistic speeds, classical expressions might not suffice, as need to compute the momentum when energy is ~50 MeV. Since electron\'s rest mass energy is 0.511 MeV, 50 MeV will require relativistic calculation. The energy is given, so E = 50 MeV. Let\'s relate the momentum, and then get k. \n\nThe relation for total energy E is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So,\n\nE = γ m c²\nSo E² = p² c^2 + m² c^4 → p² c² = E² - m² c^4 → p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/c.\n\nAlternatively, pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 )\n\nConverting everything into units like MeV and using natural units where c=1. But perhaps use SI units. However, given that in calculations about momentum, usually Hartree atomic units aren\'t the case here, perhaps use E = 50 MeV for electron, rest mass m_e c²=0.511 MeV.\n\nThus, (E/c)² = p² + (m c)^2 → p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 )\n\nConvert 50 MeV and 0.511 MeV into joules:\n\nE = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV × 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.01e-13 J\n\nmc^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 ×1.602e-19 ≈ 8.18e-14 J\n\nSo pc = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (8.01e-13 J )² - (8.18e-14 J )² )\n\nBut since E / m c² ≈50/0.511≈97.84. So E ≈97.84 m c², which implies ultra-relativistic. Under such circumstances, E ≈pc, approximate. Let\'s check:\n\np≈E /c.\n\nBut carry through with exact values:\n\np≈sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50*sqrt(1 - (0.511)^2/(50)^2 )≈50*(1 -0.5*(0.511/50)^2 ), but negligible. So taking p≈50 MeV/c.\n\nHence, p=50 MeV/c. Now, k is the wave number, k =p/ħ. To compute k, need to convert MeV/c into SI units. But with natural units~ Alternatively, use that in electron scattering, momentum p in units of MeV/c, and wavenumber k is related by k = p/ħ. Alternatively, convert MeV/c to unit of inverse meters. Let us recall that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm ( fermis =1e-15 m ). So p=50 MeV/c ⇒ express p as (50 MeV)/c ⇒ so k=p/ħ = (50 MeV)/(ħc). But ħc=197.33 MeV fm, so k=50 / 197.33 ≈0.2534 fm^{-1} = 0.2534 ×1e15 m⁻¹≈2.534e14 m⁻¹. If necessary, k=50 / (197.33 MeV·fm/c ) * c => numerical values?\n\nBut wait, actual problem might not need numerical value. Suppose factor k is treated as given when they’re asking for expression. Wait, but wait the question specifies "Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction." It will in its SI units (which? Typically scattering amplitude is in dimensionless or length units? Here:\n\nf(0)= term in sum, so with units inverse momentum given ik corresponds to dimensions:\n\nSum terms are dimensionless (since exponential terms are (e^{2i delta ) -1 } but sum is multiplied by (1/(2ik)) where k has unit 1/length. Wait, in the expression f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) Sum[ (2l+1)(e^{2i delta_l} -1)P_l(cosθ) ]\n\nthen (sum is for unit 1/(length) for f(θ), so f has units of length. Hence, inverse wavenumber, since k~1/length. That is, when answering, units should be in fm or meters, but given that the problem gives energy in MeV, but doesn\'t specify units to report. Alternatively, maybe entering with all calculated quantities. Otherwise, the problem may actually expect an expression depending on k. but we need to see if a numerical value is expected. The given energy is 50 MeV.\n\nBut maybe get an exact formula here. Moreover, perhaps disregarding numerical value, here\'s another thought:\n\nThe phase shifts being given as angles. Through the equations envisioned, Im f(0) = Σ ( (2l +1)/k ) sin^2(delta_l )\n\n only if using optical theorem. But in the original calculation via partial wave expansion, How come? Initial approach gives\n\nIm f(0) ≈ 9.1024/2k , else further. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go back to compute sum:\n\nSum is over l=[0,4] (2l+1)[e^{2i delta_l} -1]\n\nThe real part being calculated as quantifying up to -18.2048.\n\nThen, Im[f(0)] = (18.2048)/(2k) =9.1024/k.\n\nBut once I calculate k as described, = E=50MeV electrons. Compute numerically but I need k in terms of inverse meters. Let us go through a precise calculation with proper constants.\n\nFirst, since k =p/ħ.\n\nLet\'s define Planck\'s constant ħ ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm/c. Since c≈3.0e8 m/s.\n\nSo given that ħc ≈197.33 MeV·fm → ħ= (197.33 MeV·fm)/c. So that:\n\nk= p / ħ= (50 MeV/c )/(197.33 MeV·fm /c ) ) =50/(197.33 ) fm^{-1} ≈0.2535 fm⁻¹ =0.2535×1e15 m⁻¹≈2.535e14 m⁻¹.\n\nThus k≈2.535×10^14 m⁻¹.\n\nThus, Im[f(0)]=9.1024 /k =9.1024 / (2.535e14 m⁻¹ )≈ 3.59e-14 m. Approximately  3.59×10⁻¹⁴ meters. To convert into fermis (as is often in nuclear physics), 1 fm=1e-15 m, so  3.59×10⁻¹⁴ m=35.9 fm.\n\nThus, approximately 36 fermis. But want to check the calculation:\n\nEarlier steps:\n\nSum real part−18.2048 ⇒ 18.2048/k. k=50/197.33≈0.2535 fm⁻¹ ⇒ 18.2048 /0.2535 fm≈71.8 fm. Hence Im f(0)=71.8/(2)≃35.9 fm.\n\nYes. Therefore, the answer is approximately 36 femtometers.\n\nBut alternative approach. The problem stated that we’re to calculate the imaginary part of the amplitude. The blank check phase shifts sum and got not just sin, maybe was a degradation. Wait, but what\'s the correct process.\n\nLet me recall. Considère another approach to calculate the imaginary part of f(0) from partial waves. Here is another way:\n\nExpressed as:\n\nThe imaginary part of f(0):\n\nIm[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l +1) sin(2δ_l)\n\nAccording to the original f(θ) expression:\n\nThe imaginary part of f(0) comes from Im[ (1/(2ik))Σ(2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l}-1 )]\n\nSince the terms are:\n\nSum = Σ (2l+1)( cos(2δ_l)+i sin(2δ_l ) -1 )\n\nSo Sum = Σ(2l+1)( cos(2δ_l)-1 + i sin(2δ_l))\n\nTherefore, Sum has a real part, let’s Name Re(Sum), and Im(Sum) = Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )\n\nThen,\n\n(1/(2ik)) Sum = [1/(2ik)] (Re(Sum) + i Im(Sum )) = [Re(Sum)/(2i k ) + Im(Sum)/(2k )]\n= [ - i Re(Sum)/(2k ) + Im(Sum)/(2k ) ]\n\nHence, the overall complex term:\n\nthe real part of f(0) is Im(Sum)/(2k )\n\nand the imaginary part of f( given) is - Re(Sum )/(2k )\n\nBut wait, in normal scattering amplitude, according to optical theorem, Im[f(0)] should be proportional to σ_total, which involves Physics.\n\nWait, but these phase shifts correspond to real potentials in elastic scattering; hence, breaking it dependentes. In the absence of absorption (only elastic scattering), the total cross-section equals the elastic cross-section. However, the phase shifts here imply sum to find Im f(0)= [ Re Sum ] / (2k ), which we calculated as approximately 18.2 / (2k ) ≈ 9.1 /k, which using k=50/197≈0.253 in fm⁻¹; 9.1/0.253≈36 fm.\n\nBut cross-check with the optical theorem: the total cross-section σ_total= Im[f(0)] *4π/k. If we compute σ= Im f(0)*4π/k, if Im f(0)=9.1024/k, thenσ=9.1024/k *4π/k=36.4096 π/k². Given that k≈50/197.33approx0.2535. Then 0.2535^2≈0.0642 in fm⁻². So σ ≈36.4096 *3.1416 /0.0642 fm²≈36.4*3.1416/(0.0642). Compute 36.4*3.1416≈114.36, then 114.36 /0.0642≈1780 fm². Which is 1780 barns (1 barn=1e-28 m²; 1 (fm)² is 1e-30m²=0.01 barn). So 1780 fm²=17.8 barn. That’s a reasonable total cross-section, in nuclear contexts. But post this: \n\nUsing instead partial waves summation σ_elastic= (4π/k² ) Σ (2l+1) sin²(delta_l ). For each phase shift, compute each term:\n\nFor l=0: delta=90°, sin^2(90)=1; 1*1=1.\n\nl=1: sin^2(67°)=approx sin^2(60°)～3/4, but exact value to calculate.\n\nsin67 ≈0.9205, sin^2=0.8473. So 3 terms *0.8473 ≈2.5419.\n\nl=2: delta=55°, sin^2(55°)=0.6710. 0.6710*5=3.355.\n\nSimilarly l=3: 30°, sin30=0.5, 7*(0.25)=1.75.\n\nl=4: sin(13°)=approx0.22495, squaring is 0.0506, multiplied by9 gives≈0.455.\n\nSo Sum_for_sigma=1+2.5419+3.355+1.75+0.455≈1+2.541=3.541+3.355=6.896+1.75=8.646+0.455≈9.101.\n\nThus σ_elastic=4π/(k²)*9.101.\n\nRecall k=0.2535 as previously, k²=0.0642 in 1/fm². So σ=4π *9.101 /0.0642≈4*3.1416*9.101 /0.0642≈114.87 /0.0642≈1789 fm²≈17.9 barns (as above). From before. If follow optical theorem, σ_total=4π/k * Im f(0). So with Im f(0)=36.4096 fm ≅3.64e-14 m.\n\nσ_total=4π/(2.535e14 m^{-1}) *36e-15 m. Hold on, confusion of units.\n\nWait, the units:\n\nIm[f] has actually units of length (since f is the scattering amplitude with units of length). k has units of inverse length.\n\n4pi/k * Im f → (4π * length) / (1/length )=4pi * length². Which is cross-section, which makes sense. If Im[f] is e.g., 35.9 fm, k=0.2535fm⁻¹=1/(3.943fm). Hmm.\n\nSo σ_total=4pi * Im[f(0)] / k=4pi*35.9 fm/(0.2535 fm⁻¹)= 4pi *35.9 /0.2535 *\n\nCalculate 35.9 /0.2535 ≈141.65\n\n4pi *141.65≈4*3.1416*141.65≈548.2*3.1416≈1721. Which conforms the previous result≈17.9 barns.\n\nWhich was about 1789 fm²=17.89 barns (as 1 barn=1e2 fm²). So this cross-checks: using both methods, either σ=4pi/k * Im [f(0 )], and fromσ= (4pi/k^2 ) Sum( ... ), gives matching results≈17.8. Hence In the partial wave summation calculation, Im [f(0 )] is indeed correctly arrived by Real Sum calculation. Therefore, thinking process supportan Im[f(0 )] ≈36 fm≈3.6e-14 m.\n\nHence the Answer approximately 36 femtometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \\boxed{36} femtometers.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743813829, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5131, prompt_tokens=787, total_tokens=5918, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction for the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target, we use the given phase shifts \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). 

The scattering amplitude in the forward direction (θ = 0°) is given by:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l + 1)(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1)
\]
where \(k\) is the wave number. The imaginary part of \(f(0)\) is derived from the real part of the summation term. 

For each phase shift, we compute the real part of \((2l + 1)(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1)\):
- \(l = 0\): \(1 \times (-1 - 1) = -2\)
- \(l = 1\): \(3 \times (\cos(134^\circ) - 1) \approx 3 \times (-1.69465837) \approx -5.084\)
- \(l = 2\): \(5 \times (\cos(110^\circ) - 1) \approx 5 \times (-1.3420) = -6.71\)
- \(l = 3\): \(7 \times (\cos(60^\circ) - 1) = 7 \times (-0.5) = -3.5\)
- \(l = 4\): \(9 \times (\cos(26^\circ) - 1) \approx 9 \times (-0.1012) = -0.9108\)

Summing these values gives the real part of the summation term:
\[
-2 - 5.084 - 6.71 - 3.5 - 0.9108 = -18.2048
\]

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is then:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{- \text{Re}(\text{Sum})}{2k} = \frac{18.2048}{2k}
\]

The wave number \(k\) is calculated using the relativistic momentum \(p\) for 50 MeV electrons. Given \(E = 50\) MeV and the electron rest mass \(m_e c^2 = 0.511\) MeV, we find \(p \approx 50\) MeV/\(c\). Converting this to \(k\) using \(\hbar c \approx 197.33\) MeV·fm, we get:
\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar} \approx \frac{50 \text{ MeV}/c}{197.33 \text{ MeV·fm}/c} \approx 0.2535 \text{ fm}^{-1}
\]

Substituting \(k\) into the expression for the imaginary part:
\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{18.2048}{2 \times 0.2535} \approx 36 \text{ fm}
\]

Thus, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \(\boxed{36}\) femtometers.

Final Result: 

Im[f(0)] = (-Sum_real)/(2k). Compute k using E = 50 MeV electrons. Relate k to momentum p with E = p²/(2m), with m as relativistic mass. For accuracy, use relativistic energy relation, but given electrons are measured in high velocity and light speed approximations. Uncertainties here require a check. However, the phase shifts are given as input, and the problem restricts phase shifts to l=0–4, so assume k is provided or needs calculation. If question mentions 50 MeV, but only as given information necessary for calculation, perhaps k is irrelevant because the problem might expect expression up to factors of k. However, actual answers need evaluation. Phase shifts’ imaginary parts come from some sort of potential, but I think calculate the required value. Let me see:

Alternatively, according to the optical theorem, Im f(0) = k/(4π) * σ_total. But here we're not given σ_total; but perhaps if we compute via partial wave expansion and the optical theorem.

Alternatively, note that the optical theorem states that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section by Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) σ_total. So if we can calculate σ_total through partial wave contributions. But does the given phase shifts allow computing σ_total? For elastic scattering, σ_elastic = (4π/k²) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin²δ_l (since for each l, the scattering amplitude contributes sin²δ_l to the cross-section). But wait, the question is about the total cross-section. If there's no inelastic scattering, σ_total = σ_elastic, so in such cases, Im f(0) = (k/(4π)) * σ_elastic = (k/(4π)) * (4π/k²) Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l) ) = (Σ (2l+1) sin²δ_l ) / k.

Thus, Im f(0) = Σ (2l + 1) sin²δ_l / k. Alternatively, check per partial wave expansion:

Wait, perhaps unnecessarily complicating. Let me go back to the original equation for Im f(0). Given that:

From sum over f(0) partial waves:

Term_l = (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) - 1 ) = (2l+1)[ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

Summing Term_l over l=0 to4, the Real part of Sum is Σ (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l)-1) and Imag part is Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Im[f(0)] = (1/(2ik)) * Sum =.

Expressed as ( -i/(2k) )*(Real Sum + i Imag Sum ) = ( -i/(2k) )(Real Sum) + (1/(2k) )Imag Sum.

Thus, Im[ f(0) ] = ( - Real Sum )/(2k ).

But Real Sum = Σ (2l +1)( cos(2δ_l) −1 )

Which can compute explicitly.

Instead of trying other methods, proceed step-by-step.

First, For each l from 0 to 4:

Compute (2l +1)*(cos(2δ_l) −1 )

nominated into terms.

Given δ_0 = 90°, so 2δ_0 = 180°, cos 180° = -1, hence Term0 real part:1*( -1 -1 ) = -2.

l=0: 2*0 +1=1; δ=90°, 2δ=180°, cos(180)= -1; 1*( -1 -1 )= -2.

l=1: delta=67°, 2delta=134°, cos(134)=cos(180-46)= -cos46 ≈ -0.69465837 (if cos46≈0.69465837)

Hence, (2*1 +1)=3 ; 3*( -0.69465837 −1 )=3*( -1.69465837 )≈ -5.08397512.

l=2: delta=55°, 2delta=110°, cos(110°)=cos(180−70)= −cos70≈−0.3420.

So, (2*2 +1)=5*( −0.3420 −1 )=5*(−1.3420)=−6.71.

l=3: delta=30°, 2delta=60°, cos60=0.5;(this a typo, 2delta is 60°, cos60=0.5 => 2l+1=7*(0.5 -1) cos(60)=0.5, cos(60) –1 =−0.5. Then Term3_real=(2l+1)*(0.5−1) =7*(−0.5)=−3.5.

l=4: delta=13°, 2delta=26°; cos(26°)≈0.898794046.

So, compute cos(26°)= approx ≅0.8988.


Hence, Term4_real= (2*4 +1)*(0.8988 -1)=9*(-0.1012)= -0.9108.

Hence, sum all they terms:

-2 (l=0) −5.08397512 (l=1) −6.71 (l=2) −3.5 (l=3) −0.9108 (l=4) ≈(−2) + (−5.084) + (−6.71) + (−3.5) + (−0.9108) ≈−2−5.084=−7.084−6.71=−13.794−3.5=−17.294−0.9108≈−18.2048.

Thus, Real Sum≈−18.2048.

Thus, Im[f(0)] = (- Real Sum) / (2k) = (18.2048)/(2k) ≈9.1024/k.

Now, we need to compute k. Since electrons are at 50 MeV. Given relativistic speeds, classical expressions might not suffice, as need to compute the momentum when energy is ~50 MeV. Since electron's rest mass energy is 0.511 MeV, 50 MeV will require relativistic calculation. The energy is given, so E = 50 MeV. Let's relate the momentum, and then get k. 

The relation for total energy E is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So,

E = γ m c²
So E² = p² c^2 + m² c^4 → p² c² = E² - m² c^4 → p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/c.

Alternatively, pc = sqrt(E² - (mc²)^2 )

Converting everything into units like MeV and using natural units where c=1. But perhaps use SI units. However, given that in calculations about momentum, usually Hartree atomic units aren't the case here, perhaps use E = 50 MeV for electron, rest mass m_e c²=0.511 MeV.

Thus, (E/c)² = p² + (m c)^2 → p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 )

Convert 50 MeV and 0.511 MeV into joules:

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV × 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.01e-13 J

mc^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV = 0.511e6 ×1.602e-19 ≈ 8.18e-14 J

So pc = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (8.01e-13 J )² - (8.18e-14 J )² )

But since E / m c² ≈50/0.511≈97.84. So E ≈97.84 m c², which implies ultra-relativistic. Under such circumstances, E ≈pc, approximate. Let's check:

p≈E /c.

But carry through with exact values:

p≈sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50*sqrt(1 - (0.511)^2/(50)^2 )≈50*(1 -0.5*(0.511/50)^2 ), but negligible. So taking p≈50 MeV/c.

Hence, p=50 MeV/c. Now, k is the wave number, k =p/ħ. To compute k, need to convert MeV/c into SI units. But with natural units~ Alternatively, use that in electron scattering, momentum p in units of MeV/c, and wavenumber k is related by k = p/ħ. Alternatively, convert MeV/c to unit of inverse meters. Let us recall that ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm ( fermis =1e-15 m ). So p=50 MeV/c ⇒ express p as (50 MeV)/c ⇒ so k=p/ħ = (50 MeV)/(ħc). But ħc=197.33 MeV fm, so k=50 / 197.33 ≈0.2534 fm^{-1} = 0.2534 ×1e15 m⁻¹≈2.534e14 m⁻¹. If necessary, k=50 / (197.33 MeV·fm/c ) * c => numerical values?

But wait, actual problem might not need numerical value. Suppose factor k is treated as given when they’re asking for expression. Wait, but wait the question specifies "Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction." It will in its SI units (which? Typically scattering amplitude is in dimensionless or length units? Here:

f(0)= term in sum, so with units inverse momentum given ik corresponds to dimensions:

Sum terms are dimensionless (since exponential terms are (e^{2i delta ) -1 } but sum is multiplied by (1/(2ik)) where k has unit 1/length. Wait, in the expression f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) Sum[ (2l+1)(e^{2i delta_l} -1)P_l(cosθ) ]

then (sum is for unit 1/(length) for f(θ), so f has units of length. Hence, inverse wavenumber, since k~1/length. That is, when answering, units should be in fm or meters, but given that the problem gives energy in MeV, but doesn't specify units to report. Alternatively, maybe entering with all calculated quantities. Otherwise, the problem may actually expect an expression depending on k. but we need to see if a numerical value is expected. The given energy is 50 MeV.

But maybe get an exact formula here. Moreover, perhaps disregarding numerical value, here's another thought:

The phase shifts being given as angles. Through the equations envisioned, Im f(0) = Σ ( (2l +1)/k ) sin^2(delta_l )

 only if using optical theorem. But in the original calculation via partial wave expansion, How come? Initial approach gives

Im f(0) ≈ 9.1024/2k , else further. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe go back to compute sum:

Sum is over l=[0,4] (2l+1)[e^{2i delta_l} -1]

The real part being calculated as quantifying up to -18.2048.

Then, Im[f(0)] = (18.2048)/(2k) =9.1024/k.

But once I calculate k as described, = E=50MeV electrons. Compute numerically but I need k in terms of inverse meters. Let us go through a precise calculation with proper constants.

First, since k =p/ħ.

Let's define Planck's constant ħ ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm/c. Since c≈3.0e8 m/s.

So given that ħc ≈197.33 MeV·fm → ħ= (197.33 MeV·fm)/c. So that:

k= p / ħ= (50 MeV/c )/(197.33 MeV·fm /c ) ) =50/(197.33 ) fm^{-1} ≈0.2535 fm⁻¹ =0.2535×1e15 m⁻¹≈2.535e14 m⁻¹.

Thus k≈2.535×10^14 m⁻¹.

Thus, Im[f(0)]=9.1024 /k =9.1024 / (2.535e14 m⁻¹ )≈ 3.59e-14 m. Approximately  3.59×10⁻¹⁴ meters. To convert into fermis (as is often in nuclear physics), 1 fm=1e-15 m, so  3.59×10⁻¹⁴ m=35.9 fm.

Thus, approximately 36 fermis. But want to check the calculation:

Earlier steps:

Sum real part−18.2048 ⇒ 18.2048/k. k=50/197.33≈0.2535 fm⁻¹ ⇒ 18.2048 /0.2535 fm≈71.8 fm. Hence Im f(0)=71.8/(2)≃35.9 fm.

Yes. Therefore, the answer is approximately 36 femtometers.

But alternative approach. The problem stated that we’re to calculate the imaginary part of the amplitude. The blank check phase shifts sum and got not just sin, maybe was a degradation. Wait, but what's the correct process.

Let me recall. Considère another approach to calculate the imaginary part of f(0) from partial waves. Here is another way:

Expressed as:

The imaginary part of f(0):

Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l +1) sin(2δ_l)

According to the original f(θ) expression:

The imaginary part of f(0) comes from Im[ (1/(2ik))Σ(2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l}-1 )]

Since the terms are:

Sum = Σ (2l+1)( cos(2δ_l)+i sin(2δ_l ) -1 )

So Sum = Σ(2l+1)( cos(2δ_l)-1 + i sin(2δ_l))

Therefore, Sum has a real part, let’s Name Re(Sum), and Im(Sum) = Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Then,

(1/(2ik)) Sum = [1/(2ik)] (Re(Sum) + i Im(Sum )) = [Re(Sum)/(2i k ) + Im(Sum)/(2k )]
= [ - i Re(Sum)/(2k ) + Im(Sum)/(2k ) ]

Hence, the overall complex term:

the real part of f(0) is Im(Sum)/(2k )

and the imaginary part of f( given) is - Re(Sum )/(2k )

But wait, in normal scattering amplitude, according to optical theorem, Im[f(0)] should be proportional to σ_total, which involves Physics.

Wait, but these phase shifts correspond to real potentials in elastic scattering; hence, breaking it dependentes. In the absence of absorption (only elastic scattering), the total cross-section equals the elastic cross-section. However, the phase shifts here imply sum to find Im f(0)= [ Re Sum ] / (2k ), which we calculated as approximately 18.2 / (2k ) ≈ 9.1 /k, which using k=50/197≈0.253 in fm⁻¹; 9.1/0.253≈36 fm.

But cross-check with the optical theorem: the total cross-section σ_total= Im[f(0)] *4π/k. If we compute σ= Im f(0)*4π/k, if Im f(0)=9.1024/k, thenσ=9.1024/k *4π/k=36.4096 π/k². Given that k≈50/197.33approx0.2535. Then 0.2535^2≈0.0642 in fm⁻². So σ ≈36.4096 *3.1416 /0.0642 fm²≈36.4*3.1416/(0.0642). Compute 36.4*3.1416≈114.36, then 114.36 /0.0642≈1780 fm². Which is 1780 barns (1 barn=1e-28 m²; 1 (fm)² is 1e-30m²=0.01 barn). So 1780 fm²=17.8 barn. That’s a reasonable total cross-section, in nuclear contexts. But post this: 

Using instead partial waves summation σ_elastic= (4π/k² ) Σ (2l+1) sin²(delta_l ). For each phase shift, compute each term:

For l=0: delta=90°, sin^2(90)=1; 1*1=1.

l=1: sin^2(67°)=approx sin^2(60°)～3/4, but exact value to calculate.

sin67 ≈0.9205, sin^2=0.8473. So 3 terms *0.8473 ≈2.5419.

l=2: delta=55°, sin^2(55°)=0.6710. 0.6710*5=3.355.

Similarly l=3: 30°, sin30=0.5, 7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4: sin(13°)=approx0.22495, squaring is 0.0506, multiplied by9 gives≈0.455.

So Sum_for_sigma=1+2.5419+3.355+1.75+0.455≈1+2.541=3.541+3.355=6.896+1.75=8.646+0.455≈9.101.

Thus σ_elastic=4π/(k²)*9.101.

Recall k=0.2535 as previously, k²=0.0642 in 1/fm². So σ=4π *9.101 /0.0642≈4*3.1416*9.101 /0.0642≈114.87 /0.0642≈1789 fm²≈17.9 barns (as above). From before. If follow optical theorem, σ_total=4π/k * Im f(0). So with Im f(0)=36.4096 fm ≅3.64e-14 m.

σ_total=4π/(2.535e14 m^{-1}) *36e-15 m. Hold on, confusion of units.

Wait, the units:

Im[f] has actually units of length (since f is the scattering amplitude with units of length). k has units of inverse length.

4pi/k * Im f → (4π * length) / (1/length )=4pi * length². Which is cross-section, which makes sense. If Im[f] is e.g., 35.9 fm, k=0.2535fm⁻¹=1/(3.943fm). Hmm.

So σ_total=4pi * Im[f(0)] / k=4pi*35.9 fm/(0.2535 fm⁻¹)= 4pi *35.9 /0.2535 *

Calculate 35.9 /0.2535 ≈141.65

4pi *141.65≈4*3.1416*141.65≈548.2*3.1416≈1721. Which conforms the previous result≈17.9 barns.

Which was about 1789 fm²=17.89 barns (as 1 barn=1e2 fm²). So this cross-checks: using both methods, either σ=4pi/k * Im [f(0 )], and fromσ= (4pi/k^2 ) Sum( ... ), gives matching results≈17.8. Hence In the partial wave summation calculation, Im [f(0 )] is indeed correctly arrived by Real Sum calculation. Therefore, thinking process supportan Im[f(0 )] ≈36 fm≈3.6e-14 m.

Hence the Answer approximately 36 femtometers.

**Final Answer**
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction is \boxed{36} femtometers.
