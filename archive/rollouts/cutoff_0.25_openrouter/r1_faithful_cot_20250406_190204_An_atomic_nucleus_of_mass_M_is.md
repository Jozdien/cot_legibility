# Original Question

An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. 

Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?

(Ignore the electrons.)

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an atomic nucleus undergoing fission. Let me try to parse it step by step. The nucleus is initially at rest with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments where one is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. The question is about finding the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value obtained using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation. Hmm, okay.

First, let me note down the given information:

- Initial rest mass energy: M = 300 GeV (since E = mc², and they mention rest-mass energy, so M is 300 GeV/c², but since we'll be working in units where c=1 maybe, the rest energy is 300 GeV)
- The nucleus splits into two fragments, one twice as massive as the other in rest mass. Let me denote the rest masses as m1 and m2, with m1 = 2*m2.
- The sum of the rest masses is 99% of M: m1 + m2 = 0.99*M = 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, m1 + m2 = 297 GeV and m1 = 2*m2. Let me solve for m1 and m2.

Substituting m1 = 2*m2 into the sum:

2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 297 GeV => m2 = 297 / 3 = 99 GeV. Therefore, m1 = 2*99 = 198 GeV.

So the two fragments have rest masses of 198 GeV and 99 GeV. But the original nucleus had a rest mass of 300 GeV. So the mass defect is 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. This mass defect would be converted into kinetic energy of the fragments, right? Because in fission, the total energy is conserved, so the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy should be conserved. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, all the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect.

Wait, but in relativity, the total energy is conserved. The initial total energy is just the rest energy of the nucleus, which is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the fragments plus their kinetic energies. So:

Initial energy: M = 300 GeV

Final energy: m1 + m2 + T1 + T2 = 297 GeV + T1 + T2

Since energy is conserved, 300 = 297 + T1 + T2 => T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

So the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is 3 GeV. Now, we need to find T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV), and then find the difference between the relativistic T1 and the classical approximation.

To find T1, we need to apply conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. Therefore, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

In relativity, momentum is given by gamma*m*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So, the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment should be equal. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for m1 and m2 respectively. Then:

gamma1*m1*v1 = gamma2*m2*v2

But since the problem is asking for kinetic energy, maybe it's better to express momentum in terms of energy and mass. The relativistic momentum can also be written as sqrt((E^2 - m^2c^4)/c^2). But since we are using natural units where c=1, this simplifies to sqrt(E^2 - m^2). But E here is the total energy (rest + kinetic). Wait, but kinetic energy T is (gamma - 1)m. So total energy E = gamma*m = m + T.

Alternatively, momentum p = gamma*m*v, and since gamma = (1 - v^2)^(-1/2), then p = m*v / sqrt(1 - v^2). But maybe there's a better way to relate the momenta.

Alternatively, using conservation of energy and momentum. Let me denote the total energy of each fragment as E1 and E2. Then:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV (conservation of energy)

And the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: |p1| = |p2|

In special relativity, the relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4. Again, with c=1, this is E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So for each fragment:

E1^2 = p1^2 + m1^2

E2^2 = p2^2 + m2^2

But since |p1| = |p2| = p, we can write:

E1^2 = p^2 + m1^2

E2^2 = p^2 + m2^2

And we also have E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So we have three equations:

1. E1 + E2 = 300

2. E1^2 - p^2 = m1^2

3. E2^2 - p^2 = m2^2

Subtracting equation 3 from equation 2:

E1^2 - E2^2 = m1^2 - m2^2

Which can be written as (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1 - m2)(m1 + m2)

We know E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, and m1 + m2 = 297 GeV, m1 - m2 = 99 GeV.

So:

(E1 - E2)*300 = 99*297

Therefore, E1 - E2 = (99*297)/300

Let me compute that:

99*297: 99*300 = 29700, minus 99*3 = 297, so 29700 - 297 = 29403

Then 29403 / 300 = 29403 ÷ 300 = 98.01 GeV

So E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

But we also have E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

So we can solve for E1 and E2:

Adding the two equations:

E1 + E2 = 300

E1 - E2 = 98.01

Adding them: 2E1 = 398.01 => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Then E2 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV

So the total energy of the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV) is E1 = 199.005 GeV, and the less massive one (m2 = 99 GeV) is E2 = 100.995 GeV.

Then the kinetic energies are:

T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

T2 = E2 - m2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV

Check that T1 + T2 = 1.005 + 1.995 = 3 GeV, which matches the earlier result. Good.

So the correct (relativistic) value of T1 is 1.005 GeV.

Now, we need to compute the classical (non-relativistic) approximation of T1 and find the difference.

In classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)m v². Also, in the non-relativistic case, conservation of momentum would be m1 v1 = m2 v2 (since momentum is m v).

But let's see. The classical approach would assume that the kinetic energies are T1 = (1/2)m1 v1² and T2 = (1/2)m2 v2², with m1 v1 = m2 v2 (conservation of momentum). Also, the total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But wait, in the classical case, would the total kinetic energy still be 3 GeV? Hmm, actually, in the classical approximation, the rest masses are considered separately, and the kinetic energy is separate. But the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M, so the mass defect is 3 GeV, which is converted into kinetic energy. So in the classical case, they would still have T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, but calculated using classical formulas.

Wait, but in reality, the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect via E=mc². But in the classical approximation, they might not account for relativistic effects, so maybe they just take the mass defect as the classical kinetic energy. But I need to be careful.

Alternatively, perhaps in the classical calculation, they use the same mass defect (3 GeV) converted into kinetic energy, but compute the distribution of kinetic energy between the two fragments using classical momentum conservation.

So let's proceed with that.

In the non-relativistic case:

Total kinetic energy: T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2

But T1 = (1/2)m1 v1², T2 = (1/2)m2 v2²

From momentum conservation: v2 = (m1 / m2) v1

Therefore, T2 = (1/2)m2 ( (m1 / m2)^2 v1² ) = (1/2)(m1² / m2) v1² = (m1 / m2) * (1/2)m1 v1² = (m1 / m2) T1

Therefore, T2 = (m1 / m2) T1

Given that m1 = 2 m2, so T2 = 2 T1

Therefore, total kinetic energy: T1 + 2 T1 = 3 T1 = 3 GeV => T1 = 1 GeV

So in the classical approximation, T1_classical = 1 GeV

But in the relativistic case, T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV

Therefore, the difference is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV

Wait, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. So the difference is 5 MeV.

But let me verify the calculations again to be sure.

First, relativistic calculation:

We had E1 = 199.005 GeV, m1 = 198 GeV, so T1 = 1.005 GeV

Classical calculation:

T1_classical = 1 GeV

Difference: 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV

But let me check if the classical calculation is indeed 1 GeV.

In the classical case, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, and T2 = 2 T1 (since m1 = 2 m2, so T2 = (m1/m2) T1 = 2 T1). Therefore, 3 T1 = 3 GeV => T1 = 1 GeV. That's correct.

So the difference is 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But wait, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV because 1 GeV = 1000 MeV. So 0.005 * 1000 = 5 MeV. Correct.

Therefore, the answer should be 5 MeV. But let me check if there's any mistake in the relativistic calculation.

Wait, when we did the relativistic calculation, we found E1 = 199.005 GeV, so T1 = 1.005 GeV. But let me check the steps again.

We had:

E1 + E2 = 300

E1 - E2 = 98.01

Adding: 2E1 = 398.01 => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Yes, that's correct.

Then T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. Correct.

So the difference is indeed 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV.

But let me think again: is there any relativistic effect that I might have missed here? For example, in the classical case, the kinetic energy is 1 GeV, but in reality, it's a bit higher. The more massive fragment has a slightly higher kinetic energy than the classical prediction. Wait, but in the classical case, the kinetic energy is 1 GeV, and in reality, it's 1.005 GeV. So the relativistic value is higher. That seems counterintuitive because usually, relativistic effects would make the kinetic energy lower for a given velocity, but here, perhaps because the momentum relation is different.

Alternatively, maybe the way the energy is partitioned is different. Let me check with actual velocities.

In the relativistic case, for the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV, T1 = 1.005 GeV), the total energy E1 = 199.005 GeV.

So gamma1 = E1 / m1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005076

Therefore, gamma1 ≈ 1.005076

Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²) => sqrt(1 - v²) = 1 / gamma => v = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²))

Compute v1:

1/gamma1² ≈ 1 / (1.005076)^2 ≈ 1 / 1.010178 ≈ 0.9900

So 1 - v1² ≈ 0.9900 => v1² ≈ 0.01 => v1 ≈ 0.1 c

Wait, 0.1 c is 10% the speed of light. Hmm, that's not extremely relativistic, but still, gamma is about 1.005, which is a small gamma, so the velocities are non-relativistic. Therefore, the classical approximation should be fairly close, which is why the difference is only 5 MeV.

In the classical case, T1 = 1 GeV = (1/2) m1 v1². Let's compute v1 in the classical case.

m1 = 198 GeV/c² (but in natural units, c=1, so m1 is 198 GeV)

Wait, but in classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². But here, the masses are given in GeV/c². So to compute velocities, we need to be careful with units.

Wait, perhaps in natural units where c=1, the rest mass is m, and energy is in GeV, so T = (1/2) m v², but with v in units of c. Wait, but in natural units, velocity is dimensionless (v = beta), so T = (1/2) m v², but m is in GeV (since E=mc², and c=1). So for the classical kinetic energy, T1_classical = (1/2) m1 v1², where m1 is 198 GeV, and v1 is in units of c.

But in the classical calculation, we found T1_classical = 1 GeV. So:

1 GeV = 0.5 * 198 GeV * v1² => v1² = 2 / 198 ≈ 0.0101 => v1 ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005 c

So about 10% the speed of light. In the relativistic case, gamma is 1.005, so the actual velocity would be:

gamma = 1.005076 ≈ 1 / sqrt(1 - v²)

So sqrt(1 - v²) ≈ 1 / 1.005076 ≈ 0.99495

Then 1 - v² ≈ 0.9899 => v² ≈ 0.0101 => v ≈ 0.1005 c

Wait, that's the same as the classical velocity? But that can't be. Wait, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m. So for gamma = 1.005076, T1 = (1.005076 - 1)*198 GeV ≈ 0.005076 * 198 ≈ 1.005 GeV, which matches.

But the velocity is calculated as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)) which for gamma ≈ 1.005 is sqrt(1 - 1/(1.01015)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.9900) ≈ sqrt(0.01) = 0.1 c. Wait, but in the classical case, the velocity is sqrt(2T/(m)). So sqrt(2*1 GeV / 198 GeV) = sqrt(2/198) ≈ 0.1005, same as relativistic. So the velocities are the same? But how come the kinetic energy is different?

Wait, no. Wait, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)m, which for small gamma is approximately (1/2)mv². Let's check:

gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/2 (for small v)

So (gamma - 1)m ≈ (v²/2)m, which is the classical kinetic energy. But in our case, gamma is 1.005, so (gamma - 1) = 0.005, so T_relativistic = 0.005 * 198 = 0.99 GeV, but wait, no, we had T1 = 1.005 GeV. Wait, that seems inconsistent.

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute (gamma - 1)*m1:

gamma = 1.005076

(gamma - 1) = 0.005076

0.005076 * 198 ≈ 1.005 GeV. Correct.

But the classical kinetic energy is (1/2) m1 v². Let's compute v from gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²) => 1 - v² = 1/gamma² ≈ 1/1.01015 ≈ 0.9900

So v² ≈ 0.01, so (1/2) m1 v² = 0.5 * 198 * 0.01 = 0.99 GeV

But in the classical calculation, we had T1_classical = 1 GeV. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, why?

Because in the classical calculation, we used the conservation of momentum and energy. Let me check again.

In the classical case:

T1 + T2 = 3 GeV

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2

But m1 = 2 m2, so 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 => 2 v1 = v2

Then T1 = (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2)(2 m2) v1² = m2 v1²

T2 = (1/2) m2 v2² = (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = (1/2) m2 4 v1² = 2 m2 v1²

Therefore, T1 + T2 = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV

Therefore, m2 v1² = 1 GeV

But m2 is 99 GeV (rest mass). Wait, but m2 is in GeV/c². So in classical terms, the mass is 99 GeV/c². But in the kinetic energy formula, T = (1/2) m v², but m here should be in kg, and v in m/s. But we are working in natural units where c=1, so mass is in GeV/c², but energy is in GeV. So to compute T in GeV, we need to use T = (1/2) m (v²) where m is in GeV/c² and v is in units of c. Therefore, T = (1/2) m (v²) in units where c=1.

Therefore, m2 v1² = 1 GeV => 99 GeV * v1² = 1 GeV => v1² = 1/99 => v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c

Then T1 = m2 v1² = 1 GeV (as per the classical calculation). But wait, m2 is 99 GeV, so T1 = 99 * (1/99) = 1 GeV. Correct.

But in the relativistic case, the velocity is the same? Wait, no. Wait, in the relativistic case, we found v1 ≈ 0.1 c, which is the same as the classical velocity. But the kinetic energy in the relativistic case is higher. How is that possible?

Wait, no. Let me check again. In the relativistic case, the velocity is calculated as:

gamma = E1 / m1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005076

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²) => 1 - v² = 1 / gamma² ≈ 0.9900 => v² ≈ 0.01 => v ≈ 0.1 c

So same velocity as classical. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m1 ≈ 0.005076 * 198 ≈ 1.005 GeV, whereas in the classical case, it's (1/2) m1 v² = 0.5 * 198 * 0.01 = 0.99 GeV. Wait, but in our previous classical calculation, we had T1_classical = 1 GeV. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.

In the classical calculation using momentum and energy conservation, we found T1 = 1 GeV. But if we compute T1 using the classical formula (1/2) m1 v² with v = 0.1 c, we get 0.99 GeV. But why the difference?

Ah, because in the classical calculation, the velocity is determined by the momentum conservation and energy conservation, which gives a different velocity than the one derived from the relativistic case. Wait, but in the relativistic case, the velocity is the same as the classical velocity? That can't be.

Wait, no. Let's re-examine.

In the relativistic case, we have:

E1 = 199.005 GeV, m1 = 198 GeV

So gamma1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005076

Therefore, v1 = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma1^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/1.01015) ≈ sqrt(0.00995) ≈ 0.09975 c ≈ 0.1 c

In the classical case, from momentum conservation:

m1 v1 = m2 v2

With m1 = 2 m2, so 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 => v2 = 2 v1

Total kinetic energy:

T1 + T2 = (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 v2² = (1/2)(2 m2) v1² + (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV

Therefore, m2 v1² = 1 GeV => v1² = 1 GeV / m2 = 1 / 99 (GeV / GeV) => v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 c

So in the classical case, v1 ≈ 0.1005 c, and in the relativistic case, v1 ≈ 0.09975 c. So they are slightly different. Therefore, the velocities are not exactly the same, but very close.

But when we computed the relativistic kinetic energy, we used the actual gamma, which gave T1 = 1.005 GeV, whereas the classical calculation gave T1 = 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV.

But if we compute the classical kinetic energy using the relativistic velocity, we get:

T1_classical_with_relativistic_v = (1/2) m1 v1² = 0.5 * 198 * (0.09975)^2 ≈ 0.5 * 198 * 0.00995 ≈ 0.5 * 198 * 0.00995 ≈ 0.5 * 1.9701 ≈ 0.985 GeV

But in the classical calculation using momentum conservation, T1 is 1 GeV. So there's a slight inconsistency here. Wait, why?

Because in the classical calculation, the velocity is determined by the momentum conservation and energy conservation, which gives a slightly different velocity than the relativistic case. Therefore, the classical T1 is 1 GeV, but if you use the velocity from the relativistic case in the classical formula, you get approximately 0.985 GeV, which is different. But in our problem, the classical approximation would assume that the velocities are non-relativistic and use the classical conservation laws to find T1. Therefore, the classical T1 is 1 GeV, and the relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV, so the difference is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer should be 5 MeV.

But let me check once more to ensure there are no mistakes.

Relativistic T1: 1.005 GeV

Classical T1: 1 GeV

Difference: 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV

Yes, that seems correct.

**Final Answer**
The difference between the correct T1 value and the classical approximation is \boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an atomic nucleus undergoing fission. Let me try to parse it step by step. The nucleus is initially at rest with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments where one is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. The question is about finding the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value obtained using a classical (non-relativistic) approximation. Hmm, okay.

First, let me note down the given information:

- Initial rest mass energy: M = 300 GeV (since E = mc², and they mention rest-mass energy, so M is 300 GeV/c², but since we'll be working in units where c=1 maybe, the rest energy is 300 GeV)
- The nucleus splits into two fragments, one twice as massive as the other in rest mass. Let me denote the rest masses as m1 and m2, with m1 = 2*m2.
- The sum of the rest masses is 99% of M: m1 + m2 = 0.99*M = 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, m1 + m2 = 297 GeV and m1 = 2*m2. Let me solve for m1 and m2.

Substituting m1 = 2*m2 into the sum:

2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 297 GeV => m2 = 297 / 3 = 99 GeV. Therefore, m1 = 2*99 = 198 GeV.

So the two fragments have rest masses of 198 GeV and 99 GeV. But the original nucleus had a rest mass of 300 GeV. So the mass defect is 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. This mass defect would be converted into kinetic energy of the fragments, right? Because in fission, the total energy is conserved, so the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy should be conserved. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, all the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect.

Wait, but in relativity, the total energy is conserved. The initial total energy is just the rest energy of the nucleus, which is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the fragments plus their kinetic energies. So:

Initial energy: M = 300 GeV

Final energy: m1 + m2 + T1 + T2 = 297 GeV + T1 + T2

Since energy is conserved, 300 = 297 + T1 + T2 => T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

So the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is 3 GeV. Now, we need to find T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV), and then find the difference between the relativistic T1 and the classical approximation.

To find T1, we need to apply conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. Therefore, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

In relativity, momentum is given by gamma*m*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So, the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment should be equal. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for m1 and m2 respectively. Then:

gamma1*m1*v1 = gamma2*m2*v2

But since the problem is asking for kinetic energy, maybe it's better to express momentum in terms of energy and mass. The relativistic momentum can also be written as sqrt((E^2 - m^2c^4)/c^2). But since we are using natural units where c=1, this simplifies to sqrt(E^2 - m^2). But E here is the total energy (rest + kinetic). Wait, but kinetic energy T is (gamma - 1)m. So total energy E = gamma*m = m + T.

Alternatively, momentum p = gamma*m*v, and since gamma = (1 - v^2)^(-1/2), then p = m*v / sqrt(1 - v^2). But maybe there's a better way to relate the momenta.

Alternatively, using conservation of energy and momentum. Let me denote the total energy of each fragment as E1 and E2. Then:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV (conservation of energy)

And the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: |p1| = |p2|

In special relativity, the relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4. Again, with c=1, this is E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So for each fragment:

E1^2 = p1^2 + m1^2

E2^2 = p2^2 + m2^2

But since |p1| = |p2| = p, we can write:

E1^2 = p^2 + m1^2

E2^2 = p^2 + m2^2

And we also have E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So we have three equations:

1. E1 + E2 = 300

2. E1^2 - p^2 = m1^2

3. E2^2 - p^2 = m2^2

Subtracting equation 3 from equation 2:

E1^2 - E2^2 = m1^2 - m2^2

Which can be written as (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1 - m2)(m1 + m2)

We know E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, and m1 + m2 = 297 GeV, m1 - m2 = 99 G

Here's a rephrasing of the text that preserves the meaning:

I've been given a physics problem concerning an atomic nucleus that undergoes fission. Let me try to analyze it one step at a time. The nucleus, with an initial rest mass energy of 300 GeV, is at rest. It then splits into two fragments, with one fragment having twice the rest mass of the other. Furthermore, the total rest mass of the two fragments is equal to 99% of the initial mass M. The problem asks me to determine the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using a classical, non-relativistic approximation. Okay, let me think about this.

First, I'll jot down the information provided:

- The initial rest mass energy is M = 300 GeV (since E = mc², and they mention rest-mass energy, M is 300 GeV/c², but if we work in units where c=1, the rest energy is simply 300 GeV)
- The nucleus splits into two fragments, with one fragment having twice the rest mass of the other. I'll label the rest masses as m1 and m2, where m1 = 2*m2.
- The sum of the rest masses is 99% of M: m1 + m2 = 0.99*M = 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, m1 + m2 = 297 GeV and m1 = 2*m2. I'll solve for m1 and m2.

By substituting m1 = 2*m2 into the sum:

2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 297 GeV => m2 = 297 / 3 = 99 GeV. Consequently, m1 = 2*99 = 198 GeV.

Thus, the two fragments have rest masses of 198 GeV and 99 GeV. However, the original nucleus had a rest mass of 300 GeV. The mass defect is therefore 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. This mass defect would be converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments, correct? In fission, the total energy is conserved, so the sum of the rest mass energy and kinetic energy should remain constant. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, all the kinetic energy originates from the mass defect.

Hold on, in relativity, it's the total energy that's conserved. The initial total energy is simply the rest energy of the nucleus, which is 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies of the fragments and their kinetic energies. So:

Initial energy: M = 300 GeV

Final energy: m1 + m2 + T1 + T2 = 297 GeV + T1 + T2

Since energy is conserved, 300 = 297 + T1 + T2 => T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Therefore, the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is 3 GeV. Now, we need to find T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV), and then calculate the difference between the relativistic T1 and the classical approximation.

To determine T1, we need to apply conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum of the fragments must be zero. Consequently, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

In relativity, momentum is given by gamma*m*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So, the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment should be equal. I'll denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for m1 and m2 respectively. Then:

gamma1*m1*v1 = gamma2*m2*v2

But since the problem is asking for kinetic energy, it might be better to express momentum in terms of energy and mass. The relativistic momentum can also be written as sqrt((E^2 - m^2c^4)/c^2). However, since we are using natural units where c=1, this simplifies to sqrt(E^2 - m^2). Here, E is the total energy (rest + kinetic). Hold on, kinetic energy T is (gamma - 1)m. So total energy E = gamma*m = m + T.

Alternatively, momentum p = gamma*m*v, and since gamma = (1 - v^2)^(-1/2), then p = m*v / sqrt(1 - v^2). But perhaps there's a more effective way to relate the momenta.

Another approach is to use conservation of energy and momentum. I'll denote the total energy of each fragment as E1 and E2. Then:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV (conservation of energy)

And the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: |p1| = |p2|

In special relativity, the relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4. Again, with c=1, this becomes E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So for each fragment:

E1^2 = p1^2 + m1^2

E2^2 = p2^2 + m2^2

But since |p1| = |p2| = p, we can write:

E1^2 = p^2 + m1^2

E2^2 = p^2 + m2^2

And we also have E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So we have three equations:

1. E1 + E2 = 300

2. E1^2 - p^2 = m1^2

3. E2^2 - p^2 = m2^2

Subtracting equation 3 from equation 2:

E1^2 - E2^2 = m1^2 - m2^2

Which can be written as (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1 - m2)(m1 + m2)

We know E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, and m1 + m2 = 297 GeV, m1 - m2

Alright, I have a physics problem about an atomic nucleus undergoing fission, and I'm going to tackle it one step at a time. The nucleus starts at rest with a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. It then splits into two fragments, where one fragment's rest mass is twice that of the other. The total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass, M. The goal is to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value from a classical (non-relativistic) approximation. Let's dive in.

Here’s what we know:

- Initial rest mass energy: M = 300 GeV. Since they mention rest-mass energy, M is 300 GeV/c², but if c = 1, the rest energy remains 300 GeV.
- Upon splitting, the fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 = 2*m2.
- The sum of the rest masses is 99% of M: m1 + m2 = 0.99*M = 0.99*300 GeV = 297 GeV.

With m1 = 2*m2, we can calculate:

2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 297 GeV, thus m2 = 297 / 3 = 99 GeV, giving m1 = 2*99 = 198 GeV.

The fragments have rest masses of 198 GeV and 99 GeV, respectively. The original nucleus had a rest mass of 300 GeV, so the mass defect is 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. This mass defect is converted into the kinetic energy of the fragments because energy conservation means the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy remains constant. Since the nucleus initially rests, any kinetic energy comes from the mass defect.

Remember, according to relativity, the total energy is conserved. Initially, the total energy is the nucleus's rest energy: 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy also equals the rest energies of the fragments plus their kinetic energies:

Initial energy: M = 300 GeV

Final energy: m1 + m2 + T1 + T2 = 297 GeV + T1 + T2

Since energy is conserved, 300 = 297 + T1 + T2, so T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Thus, the two fragments together have 3 GeV of kinetic energy. Our task is to find T1, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV), and compare it with its classical counterpart.

To determine T1, we use momentum conservation. The initially resting nucleus implies the fragments' total momentum is zero. Thus, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

In relativity, momentum is gamma*m*v, with gamma as the Lorentz factor. So, the fragments' momentum magnitudes are equal. If v1 and v2 are the velocities for m1 and m2 respectively, then:

gamma1*m1*v1 = gamma2*m2*v2

Since the question seeks kinetic energy, let's express momentum in terms of energy and mass. The relativistic momentum can be written as sqrt((E^2 - m^2c^4)/c^2). In natural units where c=1, this simplifies to sqrt(E^2 - m^2), where E is the total energy (rest plus kinetic). However, kinetic energy, T, is given as (gamma - 1)m. Hence, total energy E = gamma*m = m + T.

Using the conservation laws:

1. E1 + E2 = 300 GeV (energy conservation)

2. |p1| = |p2| (momentum conservation)

From special relativity, we have E^2 = p^2 + m^2, so for the fragments:

E1^2 = p1^2 + m1^2

E2^2 = p2^2 + m2^2

With |p1| = |p2| = p, the equations become:

E1^2 = p^2 + m1^2

E2^2 = p^2 + m2^2

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV. 

So you have:

1. E1 + E2 = 300

2. E1^2 - p^2 = m1^2

3. E2^2 - p^2 = m2^2

Subtracting the third equation from the second gives:

E1^2 - E2^2 = m1^2 - m2^2

Expressing it as (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1 - m2)(m1 + m2), and given that E1 + E2 = 300 GeV and m1 + m2 = 297 GeV, you can proceed to solve for E1 and E2 and then find T1.

Given an atomic nucleus of mass \( M \) with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, which splits into two fragments with rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) such that \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of \( M \). The goal is to find the difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies of the more massive fragment.

1. **Determine the rest masses of the fragments:**
   - The sum of the rest masses is \( 0.99 \times 300 \, \text{GeV} = 297 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - Given \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), solving \( 3m_2 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \) gives \( m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Relativistic calculation:**
   - Total energy conservation: \( E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - Momentum conservation: \( |p_1| = |p_2| \).
   - Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation \( E^2 = p^2 + m^2 \):
     - \( E_1^2 - E_2^2 = m_1^2 - m_2^2 \)
     - Solving \( (E_1 - E_2)(E_1 + E_2) = (m_1 - m_2)(m_1 + m_2) \) gives \( E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \, \text{GeV} \).
     - Solving the system \( E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E_1 - E_2 = 98.01 \, \text{GeV} \) gives \( E_1 = 199.005 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E_2 = 100.995 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - Kinetic energies: \( T_1 = E_1 - m_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Classical calculation:**
   - Momentum conservation: \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \) with \( v_2 = 2v_1 \).
   - Kinetic energy distribution: \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( T_2 = 2T_1 \).
   - Solving \( 3T_1 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \) gives \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV} \).

4. **Difference between relativistic and classical results:**
   - The difference is \( 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV} \).

\boxed{5}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

EV.

So substituting in:

(E1 - E2)*300 = 99*297

Therefore:

E1 - E2 = (99*297)/300 = (99*99*3)/300 = (9801*3)/300 = 29403/300 = 98.01 GeV

So now we have:

E1 + E2 = 300

E1 - E2 = 98.01

Adding these equations:

2E1 = 398.01 => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Therefore, E2 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV

Now, the kinetic energies are T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV

T2 = E2 - m2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV

So the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1 = 1.005 GeV, and the less massive one is T2 = 1.995 GeV. Indeed, their sum is 1.005 + 1.995 = 3 GeV, which matches the earlier calculation.

Now, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (1.005 GeV) and the classical approximation of T1. So we need to compute what T1 would be if we used classical (non-relativistic) mechanics, and then subtract that from the relativistic value.

In classical mechanics, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But we need to compute the velocities based on conservation of momentum and energy. Let's see.

In classical physics, the total momentum is also zero, so m1*v1 = m2*v2. Since the nucleus is initially at rest.

Also, the total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 3 GeV (same as before, but in classical physics, mass is conserved, so maybe we need to check if the mass defect is considered here? Wait, in classical physics, mass is conserved. But the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 297 GeV, so the missing 3 GeV is converted into kinetic energy. However, in classical physics, mass is invariant, so the rest masses would have to be same as the initial mass? Wait, but the problem says to calculate using classical approximation, but the rest masses are given as 198 and 99 GeV. So perhaps in the classical calculation, we still take the rest masses as 198 and 99 GeV, and the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect. But in classical physics, mass is not converted to energy, so maybe that's a problem. Hmm, this could be a confusion. Wait, the problem says "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M". So regardless of relativistic or classical, the rest masses are 198 and 99, sum to 297. Then the kinetic energy comes from the 3 GeV mass defect. But in classical physics, how is the kinetic energy accounted for?

Wait, in classical mechanics, mass is conserved, so the total mass after fission would still be 300 GeV. But the problem states that in reality, the rest masses are 297, and 3 GeV is kinetic. But in classical physics, there is no mass-energy equivalence, so the rest masses would still be 300 GeV? Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, perhaps in the classical approximation, we still take the rest masses as 198 and 99 GeV, same as in the relativistic case, but compute the kinetic energy using classical expressions. So the mass defect is still 3 GeV, which is converted to kinetic energy. But in classical mechanics, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and momentum is mv. So even though in reality, the rest mass is less, in the classical approximation, we model the kinetic energy as if the masses are 198 and 99, and the kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But how is this possible? Because classically, mass is invariant. So perhaps the problem is saying that the rest masses are 198 and 99 GeV, and using classical mechanics (non-relativistic) to compute their velocities and kinetic energies, then compare to the relativistic calculation. So we can proceed with that.

So, let's proceed. Let me denote in the classical case:

Total kinetic energy T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV (same as in the relativistic case, but since it's classical, maybe that's an assumption? Or is it that in classical physics, the kinetic energy would not necessarily be 3 GeV? Wait, this is a crucial point. In the relativistic case, the 3 GeV comes from the mass defect (300 - 297). But in classical physics, mass is conserved, so the sum of the rest masses would still be 300 GeV, and there is no mass defect. But the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 297 GeV regardless. Therefore, perhaps even in the classical calculation, we take the rest masses as 198 and 99, sum to 297, and the kinetic energy is 3 GeV. So the problem is designed such that the total energy is conserved as 300 GeV (rest + kinetic), but in classical physics, the kinetic energy is calculated using non-relativistic expressions. However, in reality, even in classical physics, the rest mass would be conserved? Hmm. This is a bit confusing. The problem states "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M". So in the problem, regardless of the approach (relativistic or classical), the rest masses are 198 and 99. The 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy. So perhaps in the classical calculation, we have the same rest masses and same total kinetic energy, but compute the individual kinetic energies using classical momentum conservation.

Alternatively, maybe in the classical case, the kinetic energy is computed based on the velocities derived from classical momentum conservation, which might lead to a different distribution of the kinetic energy between the fragments, but the total kinetic energy is still 3 GeV. Wait, but if we use classical momentum conservation (m1*v1 = m2*v2) and classical kinetic energy (T = (1/2)mv²), then we can compute T1 and T2 such that T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. So let's do that.

In classical mechanics:

Momentum conservation: m1*v1 = m2*v2

Therefore, (m1/m2) = (v2/v1)

Since m1 = 2*m2, so 2 = v2 / v1 => v2 = 2*v1

Kinetic energies:

T1 = (1/2)*m1*v1²

T2 = (1/2)*m2*v2² = (1/2)*m2*(2*v1)^2 = (1/2)*m2*4*v1² = 2*m2*v1²

But m1 = 2*m2, so m2 = m1 / 2

Therefore, T2 = 2*(m1 / 2)*v1² = m1*v1² = 2*T1

Because T1 = (1/2)*m1*v1² => m1*v1² = 2*T1, so T2 = 2*T1

Therefore, T1 + T2 = T1 + 2*T1 = 3*T1 = 3 GeV => T1 = 1 GeV

Therefore, in the classical approximation, T1_classical = 1 GeV

But in the relativistic case, T1_relativistic = 1.005 GeV

Therefore, the difference is 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So the difference is 5 MeV.

Wait, let me verify again.

In the classical case, momentum conservation gives m1*v1 = m2*v2. Since m1 = 2*m2, then 2*m2*v1 = m2*v2 => 2*v1 = v2.

Then, kinetic energy:

T1 = 0.5*m1*v1² = 0.5*2*m2*v1² = m2*v1²

T2 = 0.5*m2*v2² = 0.5*m2*(2*v1)² = 0.5*m2*4*v1² = 2*m2*v1²

So T1 = m2*v1², T2 = 2*m2*v1², so total kinetic energy T1 + T2 = 3*m2*v1² = 3 GeV

Therefore, m2*v1² = 1 GeV => T1 = 1 GeV, T2 = 2 GeV. So yes, T1_classical = 1 GeV.

But in the relativistic case, T1 was 1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me check the relativistic calculation again. Earlier, I found E1 = 199.005 GeV, so T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. Correct.

Therefore, the difference is 1.005 - 1.000 = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So 5 MeV.

But let me check if the units are correct. The question says, "what is the difference between the correct T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?" So the answer is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me verify once again, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, let me check the relativistic calculation again. Let me redo it step by step.

Given:

m1 = 198 GeV

m2 = 99 GeV

Total energy: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

Momentum conservation: |p1| = |p2| = p

Relativistic energy-momentum relation:

E1² = p² + m1²

E2² = p² + m2²

So subtracting:

E1² - E2² = m1² - m2²

(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1 - m2)(m1 + m2)

Plug in the numbers:

E1 - E2 = (m1 - m2)(m1 + m2)/(E1 + E2) = (99 GeV)(297 GeV)/(300 GeV) = (99*297)/300 GeV

Compute 99*297:

99 * 297:

First compute 100*297 = 29700

Subtract 1*297 = 297

29700 - 297 = 29403

Then divide by 300: 29403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV

So E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

Adding equations:

2E1 = 398.01 GeV => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Thus, T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. Correct.

Classical T1 is 1 GeV, so difference is 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.

Yes, seems consistent. So the answer is 5 MeV.

But let me think if there is another approach or if I missed any relativistic effects. Alternatively, could there be a mistake in assuming that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV in both cases? Wait, in reality, the rest mass is less, but in the classical case, do we have to adjust the kinetic energy?

Wait, the problem says "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M". So in the problem statement, this is a given fact, regardless of the frame. Therefore, even in the classical approximation, the rest masses are 198 and 99 GeV. The total rest mass is 297 GeV, and the remaining 3 GeV is kinetic energy. But in classical physics, mass is not converted to energy, so this is a bit inconsistent. However, the problem seems to set up that in both cases (relativistic and classical), the rest masses are 198 and 99, and the kinetic energy sum is 3 GeV. So in the classical case, we use the same rest masses and total KE but compute the distribution of KE using classical momentum conservation. Therefore, the answer is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV.

Therefore, the difference is 5 MeV, so the answer is \boxed{5} MeV. But the problem says "what is the difference...", and in the problem statement, it's mentioned to ignore the electrons. So, I think the answer is 5 MeV, so boxed 5 MeV.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify the unit for the answer. The initial rest mass energy is given in GeV, and the kinetic energy T1 is in GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. The question is, does it expect the answer in GeV or MeV? The problem says "what is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?" It might expect the answer in GeV, which would be 0.005 GeV, but 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Since the difference is small, it's more natural to write it in MeV. But the problem might expect the answer in GeV. Let me check the question again.

Original question: "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

It doesn't specify the unit, but the initial rest-mass energy is in GeV. The kinetic energies T1 are in GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. However, perhaps the answer should be given in GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Hmm.

But the problem mentions to "put your final answer within \boxed{}". Since in high-energy physics, MeV and GeV are standard, and 5 MeV is a small difference, but perhaps the answer is expected in GeV. However, 0.005 GeV is equal to 5 MeV. Let me see:

1 GeV = 1000 MeV, so 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. Both are correct. But depending on convention. If the question gives rest-mass energy in GeV, but the difference is more naturally expressed in MeV, then writing 5 MeV is better. But to be safe, check if the numerical answer is 0.005 or 5. The difference is 1.005 GeV (relativistic) - 1 GeV (classical) = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So if the answer is to be in GeV, then 0.005 GeV, which is 5e-3 GeV. But the problem might want it in MeV. Given that 5 is a round number, and MeV is a common unit for such differences, I think the answer is 5 MeV. So boxed 5 with unit MeV. But since the user says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and the instructions say to ignore units (probably), but the original problem mentions GeV. Wait, let me check the original problem again.

The problem states: "Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?"

The question doesn't specify units, but in the problem statement, all energies are given in GeV. However, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. However, it's possible that the answer is expected in GeV. To resolve this ambiguity, perhaps the answer is 0.005 GeV, but expressed as 5 MeV. But since the user's system might require the answer in GeV, but the problem didn't specify. However, in the calculation, the difference is 0.005 GeV. Alternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation. Let me check.

Wait, relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV. Classical T1 is 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV. 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV. So I think it's better to write \boxed{5} MeV, but since the user might want the answer in the box in GeV, perhaps 0.005 GeV. Hmm. But in the problem statement, the rest mass is given in GeV, and the kinetic energy is also in GeV. But the difference is 0.005 GeV. However, in particle physics, such small differences are often expressed in MeV. So 5 MeV. But let me check if 1.005 GeV minus 1 GeV is indeed 0.005 GeV. Yes. 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV. So 5 MeV. Therefore, I think the answer is 5 MeV, so \boxed{5} MeV. But maybe as per the user's requirement, just \boxed{5} with the assumption of MeV. The original problem didn't specify the unit for the answer, but the given data is in GeV. So to be safe, maybe write \boxed{0.005} GeV. But the difference is 0.005 GeV. Alternatively, if the system requires the answer in MeV, then 5. So perhaps the answer is 5 MeV, boxed as 5. Since 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. So \boxed{5} with the unit MeV. Given that the problem mentions to ignore electrons, but units weren't specified. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 0.005 GeV. But given that in exams, such differences are often in MeV, and the number is 5, a small integer, perhaps the answer is 5 MeV. Hence, I'll write \boxed{5} MeV, but the user might prefer GeV. But since the question says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", and didn't specify the unit, but all given data is in GeV, maybe 0.005 GeV. But 0.005 is 5 thousandths. Alternatively, check if 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV, so yes. Therefore, 0.005 GeV. But this is equal to 5 MeV. Either is correct, but given the context, maybe 5 MeV is better. But in the absence of specific units, perhaps 0.005 GeV is safer. However, in high-energy physics, 5 MeV is a common way to express such a small energy. Given that 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Either way, but since the problem mentions "difference", and the result is 5 MeV, which is a cleaner number, I think the answer is \boxed{5} MeV. But the user might want it in GeV, but since the instructions didn't specify, but the original data is in GeV, it's ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the system is automated and just wants a numerical value with box, so 0.005 or 5. But in the calculation, the difference is 0.005 GeV. If the answer is supposed to be in GeV, it's 0.005. If in MeV, it's 5. Since the question is from a physics problem, and the difference is small, 5 MeV is more sensible. So I think the answer is 5 MeV, boxed as \boxed{5}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}

Given an atomic nucleus of mass \( M \) with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV, which splits into two fragments such that one fragment is twice as massive as the other, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of \( M \). We need to find the difference between the relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) of the more massive fragment and its classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

1. **Determine the rest masses of the fragments:**
   - The total rest mass of the fragments is 99% of 300 GeV: \( 0.99 \times 300 = 297 \) GeV.
   - Let \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) be the rest masses, with \( m_1 = 2m_2 \).
   - Solving \( m_1 + m_2 = 297 \) GeV gives \( m_1 = 198 \) GeV and \( m_2 = 99 \) GeV.

2. **Relativistic calculation:**
   - Conservation of energy: \( E_1 + E_2 = 300 \) GeV, where \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) are the total energies of the fragments.
   - Conservation of momentum: \( |p_1| = |p_2| = p \).
   - Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation \( E^2 = p^2 + m^2 \):
     - \( E_1^2 = p^2 + 198^2 \)
     - \( E_2^2 = p^2 + 99^2 \)
   - Solving these equations, we find:
     - \( E_1 - E_2 = \frac{99 \times 297}{300} = 98.01 \) GeV
     - \( E_1 = 199.005 \) GeV and \( E_2 = 100.995 \) GeV
     - Kinetic energy \( T_1 = E_1 - m_1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 \) GeV.

3. **Classical calculation:**
   - Conservation of momentum: \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \) leading to \( v_2 = 2v_1 \).
   - Total kinetic energy \( T_1 + T_2 = 3 \) GeV.
   - Using \( T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 \) and \( T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 \):
     - \( T_2 = 2 T_1 \)
     - Solving \( T_1 + 2 T_1 = 3 \) GeV gives \( T_1 = 1 \) GeV.

4. **Difference between relativistic and classical results:**
   - Difference \( = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \).

\[
\boxed{0.005}
\]

= 99 GeV (since m1 = 198, m2 = 99 GeV). Plugging these into the equation:

(E1 - E2)*300 = 99*297

So,

E1 - E2 = (99*297)/300

Calculate that:

First, let's compute 99*297:

99 * 297 = (100 - 1)*(300 - 3) = 100*300 - 100*3 - 1*300 + 1*3 = 30,000 - 300 - 300 + 3 = 30,000 - 600 + 3 = 29,403.

Then, divide by 300:

29,403 / 300 = 29,403 ÷ 300 = 98.01 GeV

So, E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

So now we have two equations:

1. E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

2. E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

Adding these equations:

2*E1 = 398.01 GeV => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Then, E2 = 300 - E1 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV

Therefore, the total energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is approximately 199.005 GeV, and its kinetic energy T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

Similarly, T2 = E2 - m2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV.

Hence, in the relativistic case, T1 is approximately 1.005 GeV.

Now, the problem asks for the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the T1 calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation. So we need to compute the classical kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and find the difference.

In the classical case, we can use the conservation of momentum and energy, but with non-relativistic expressions. Let's denote the speeds as u1 and u2 for m1 and m2. Conservation of momentum:

m1*u1 + m2*u2 = 0 (since the initial momentum is zero)

Since the masses are scalar, the velocities are vectors, so they must be in opposite directions. Therefore, magnitudes: m1*u1 = m2*u2

=> u2 = (m1/m2)*u1 = 2*u1 (since m1 is twice m2. Wait, m1=198 GeV, m2=99 GeV, so m1/m2=2, correct.)

Now, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)m1*u1² + (1/2)m2*u2² = total kinetic energy, which from earlier we know is 3 GeV. But in the classical case, the sum of the rest masses is 297 GeV, but does the classical calculation account for mass-energy equivalence? Wait, probably in the classical approximation, mass is just mass, and kinetic energy is separate. But we have to ensure that the kinetic energy T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV (if we're consistent with the same energy released). Wait, no—here's a nuance.

Wait a sec. The energy released comes from the mass defect. In reality, the relativistic equations account for the conversion of mass into kinetic energy. But in the classical approximation, since physicists before relativity wouldn’t account for mass-energy equivalence. Wait, but in the problem statement, the rest masses of the fragments are given as 297 GeV, while the initial rest mass was 300 GeV. However, when doing a classical calculation, does one still consider that 3 GeV is converted into kinetic energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the idea is that in reality, if you use relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energies would be calculated as above (1.005 and 1.995 GeV), but classically, you would model the energy as 3 GeV of kinetic energy shared between the two fragments with momentum conservation. Therefore, in the classical approach, the user would still set up the problem as the initial mass splitting into two fragments with rest masses 198 GeV and 99 GeV, but assuming gamma is approximately 1 (non-relativistic) and calculate the kinetic energies accordingly. Let me proceed with this approach.

Hence, assuming non-relativistic mechanics:

Total kinetic energy T_classical_total = T1_classical + T2_classical = 3 GeV

From conservation of momentum: m1*v1 = m2*v2 => 198*v1 = 99*v2 => v2 = 2*v1.

Expressing velocities in terms:

The kinetic energy of each is (1/2)m1*v1² and (1/2)m2*v2². Let me compute T1_classical and T2_classical.

Expressing T2_classical in terms of T1_classical. From T2 = (1/2)m2*v2² = (1/2)*99*(2*v1)² = (1/2)*99*4*v1² = 198*v1². But T1 = (1/2)*198*v1² = 99*v1².

Hence, T2_classical = 198*v1² = 2*(99*v1²) = 2*T1_classical.

Therefore, T1_classical + T2_classical = T1_classical + 2*T1_classical = 3*T1_classical = 3 GeV => T1_classical = 1 GeV.

Hence, in the classical non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is 1 GeV, whereas in the relativistic case it's 1.005 GeV that we found earlier.

Therefore, the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical value is approximately 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But wait, maybe precise calculation is needed. Let me check exactly. Because in the relativistic solution, E1 was 199.005 GeV, so T1_actual = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. Then, classical was 1 GeV, so difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But perhaps, I need to verify these steps again.

First, in the relativistic case, using energy and momentum we ended up with T1=1.005 GeV and T2=1.995 GeV. Sum is 3 GeV. All good.

In classical case, considering non-relativistic KE:

From momentum conservation,

m1*v1 = m2*v2. Since m1=2*m2, then v2=2*v1.

Total KE:

0.5*m1*v1² + 0.5*m2*v2² = 0.5*2*m2*v1² + 0.5*m2*(2*v1)² = m2*v1² + 0.5*m2*4*v1² = m2*v1² + 2*m2*v1² = 3*m2*v1² = 3 GeV.

Therefore, 3*m2*v1² = 3 GeV. Hence, m2*v1² =1 GeV. Then, KE of m1 (T1_classical) is 0.5*m1*v1² =0.5*2*m2*v1² = m2*v1² =1 GeV. Hence, same as earlier.

So difference is 1.005 GeV -1 GeV=0.005 GeV, which converts to 5*10^{-3} GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV.

But let me check if the relativistic calculation was precise or if rounding errors occurred.

Original computation:

E1 - E2= (99*297)/300

99 *297 = Let me recalculate this:

99*297.

Compute 100*297=29,700

Subtract 1*297=297: 29,700 - 297 = 29,403.

29,403 divided by 300: 29,403 /300.

Compute how many times 300 goes into 29,403:

300*98=29,400. So 98 times with a remainder of 3.

So, 98 + 3/300=98.01 exactly. So, (99*297)/300 = 98.01, Hence, E1 - E2=98.01 GeV.

Thus, solving the equations:

E1 + E2=300

E1 - E2=98.01

Adding equations:

2E1=300 +98.01=398.01 => E1=398.01/2=199.005 GeV.

So E1=199.005 GeV, m1=198 GeV. T1=199.005-198=1.005 GeV.

So precisely 1.005 GeV. Therefore, relativistic KE is 1.005 GeV, classical is 1 GeV. Difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Hence, 0.005 GeV (5 MeV) is the difference. But perhaps the answer should be expressed in GeV. Let me check. Since the original question says: "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value...?" So the units would be the same as T1. T1 is given as an energy, requested here. Since it's in GeV, the difference is 0.005 GeV or 5 MeV. So exact value is 3/200 GeV = 0.015 GeV ?!

Wait, wait a second, but Wait a minute, in the calculation above, during the sum, it was ((99 *297)/300)=98.01, which isn't exact. Let me check the product:

m1 -m2=198 -99=99 GeV

m1 + m2=297 GeV

E1 - E2=( (m1 -m2)(m1 +m2) )/(E1 + E2 )= (99 *297)/300=98.01

So (99 *297)=99^2 * 3 = (9801)*3=29,403, and divided by 300 is 98.01, as before.

So solving, E1 -E2=98.01 GeV. Then, combined with E1 + E2=300 gives E1=(300 +98.01)/2=398.01/2=199.005 GeV. So that's precise. Then T1_relativistic=199.005-198=1.005 GeV, T1_classical=1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But maybe the question is designed in a way that requires a more precise relativistic calculation? That's possible. For example, perhaps I made an approximation in choosing the rest masses. Wait, the rest masses sum to 297 GeV, but since E1 and E2 sum to 300 GeV, the mass-equivalent of the energy? But we took m1 and m2 as the rest masses.

I think that's correct. In any case, the system in fission releases 3 GeV. The velocities could be such that gamma factors aren't negligible. But in this case, the kinetic energies we got were about 1 GeV each, so (KE)/(rest energy)=1/198≈0.5%, so the velocity would be non-relativistic. Wait, if KE is 1 GeV for m=198 GeV, then T ≈ 0.5% of rest energy, so betasquared/2≈0.005, beta squared ≈0.01, beta≈0.1. So speed is around 0.1c. Then non-relativistic approximation is reasonable. But since TNR =1 GeV and TR=1.005 GeV, these are close. So the difference is 0.005 GeV.

Thus, thinking that in natural units (with c=1), the answer is 0.005 GeV.

However, perhaps the problem needs a slightly different approach. Let me consider if my treatment of energy and momentum is precise.

Alternative Approach for Relativistic Calculation:

The invariant quantity here is the total energy and momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the centre of momentum frame is the same as the lab frame (original rest frame). After the decay, the two particles must depart in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the magnitudes of the momentum as p. So,

For particle 1 (mass m1=198 GeV), with total energy E1 = sqrt( p² + m1² )

For particle 2 (mass m2=99 GeV), with total energy E2 = sqrt( p² + m2² )

And E1 + E2 =300 GeV.

So we need to solve the equation:

sqrt(p² + 198² ) + sqrt(p² + 99² ) =300 GeV.

Let me compute this equation numerically. Let me denote the three terms.

But solving sqrt(p² + m1² ) + sqrt(p² + m2² )=300.

Alternatively, what's the value of p?

Let me denote x=p. Then:

sqrt(x² + 198²) + sqrt(x² +99² )=300

Let me solve for x.

Let me write sqrt(x² +198²) = 300 - sqrt(x² +99²)

Square both sides:

x² +198² = 300² -2*300*sqrt(x² +99² ) + x² +99²

Cancel x²:

198² = 300² -2*300*sqrt(x² +99² ) +99²

Rearranged:

2*300*sqrt(x² +99² ) =300² +99² -198²

Calculate RHS:

300² is 90,000

99² is 9,801

198² is 39,204

Thus: 90,000 +9,801 -39,204 = (90,000 -39,204)+9,801=50,796 +9,801=60,597

Therefore,

2*300*sqrt(x² +99²)=60,597

=>600*sqrt(x² +99²)=60,597

sqrt(x² +99²)=60,597 /600≈100.995

Wait, 60,597 ÷600: 60,597/600= in GE units:

60,597 ÷600= (60,000 +597)/600= 100 +597/600≈100 +0.995=100.995

Therefore,

sqrt(x² +99²)=100.995

Then square both sides:

x² +99²=100.995²

Compute x²=100.995² -99²

Use the difference of squares formula: a²-b²=(a-b)(a+b)

a=100.995, b=99

a-b=1.995, a+b=199.995

Thus,

x²=1.995 *199.995

1.995*200=399, so 1.995*199.995=399 -1.995*0.005=399 -0.009975=398.990025

Thus, x≈sqrt(398.990025)=approx 19.9747 GeV.

Because 19.9747² exists as approx 398.99. Hence, the momentum is approximately 19.9747 GeV.

Thus, p≈19.9747 GeV.

Now, compute E1 = sqrt( p² + m1² ) = sqrt(19.9747² +198² )

Compute that:

19.9747² is approx 398.99, 198² is39,204. So:

E1 = sqrt(398.99 +39204)=sqrt(39602.99)≈ sqrt(39604)=199, considering sqrt(39604). Wait, 199²=39601; still. 199.005^2= 199*199 +2*199*0.005 +0.005²=39601 +1.99 +0.000025=39602.990025.

But wait, sqrt(39602.99)=199.005 (approx). So indeed E1≈199.005 which matches our previous result.

Similarly, E2≈300 -199.005=100.995 as before.

Therefore, the momentum calculations seem correct, p≈19.9747 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy is (E -m) for each fragment, so for the more massive fragment (m1=198 GeV):

T1 = E1 -m1 =199.005 -198=1.005 GeV.

Similarly, for the lighter fragment, T2=100.995-99=1.995 GeV.

So everything checks out with the initial calculation.

Therefore, in the relativistic case, T1=1.005 GeV.

Using the classical calculation, where T1_classical=1 GeV.

Difference: 1.005 -1=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.

So final answer.

But also, let's double-check the KE relationship here for the classical case. If momentum are p=m1v1=198v1 and p=m2v2=99v2. So indeed v2=2v1.

Then, KE1=(1/2)m1v1²= (1/2)*198*v1²

 KE2=(1/2)*99*v2²=(1/2)*99*(2v1)²=(1/2)*99*4v1²=198*v1²

Total KE=(198/2 +198 )v1²= (99 +198) v1²= 297 v1²=3 GeV. Therefore, v1²=3/297=1/99 GeV per (mass unit? Wait). However, in the energy expressions, when in natural units where c=1, but in reality, KE is GeV (which is a unit of energy), so if mass is in GeV/c², velocity is in terms of c.

Wait masses m1 and m2 are in GeV/c². Then, when we compute in non-relativistic KE, which is (1/2) m (v)^2 *c²/(c²) ?

Wait, to clarify, in GE units where c=1, but to see dimensional analysis:

Express KE= (1/2)*m*v². If m is in GeV/c², v in units of c, then (1/2)mV² would be (GeV/c²)*(c)^2 = GeV. That is, yes. So in m=198 GeV/c², v in units of c, e.g., 0.1c. Then,

T= 0.5*(198 GeV/c²)*v^2*c²=0.5*198 *v² GeV. So in the problem where the answer is computed, in natural units (c=1), T=0.5*m*v². So with m in GeV, v unitless (v/c).

In any case, from the relativistic computation, p=19.9747 GeV. But in natural units where c=1, p=gamma*m*v, so for particle 1:

p = gamma1 *m1 *v1

So, gamma1= E1 /m1 =199.005 /198≈1.005.

Thus, v1= p/(gamma1*m1)=19.9747/(1.005*198)≈19.9747/(198 + 198*0.005)=19.9747/(198 +0.99)=19.9747/198.99≈0.1005c. So v1≈0.1005c.

Similarly, classical velocity would be p/m1=19.9747 /198=0.10088c. Actually, wait no, in classical mechanics, p=m*v is just m1*v1=19.9747 GeV (hmm, why?) Wait, hold on perhaps in natural units, but when mm m1, one has to think about units again.

Wait, but no. In the natural units where c=1, then momentum is just GeV.

Wait, to recap, m1=198 GeV (if c=1, then mass in GeV is equivalent to GeV/c², but then momentum would be GeV/c.

But in natural units where c=1, then mass is in GeV/c².

But long story short—Momentum in natural units (c=1) is in GeV/c for which with c=1 is GeV/1, so GeV. Complicated.

Alternatively, if we are working in units with c=1, then momentum has units of GeV, yes, since for example, E^2 =p^2 +m^2 and since m is in GeV, p is in GeV.

In non-relativistic case, p= m*v where m is in GeV and v is unitless (unit=c). So, Units are okay.

Hmm, perhaps needed here is matching units.

Wait now, assuming all units are natural (c=1, ħ=1, etc.), then velocities are measured as fractions of c.

But, the confusion arises perhaps in the translation between momentum and kinetic energy. But in the problem, since per instructions, we are to find the difference between T1 relativistic and T1 classical.

In precise terms, T1_classical is computed using non-relativistic formulas with masses m1, m2 and obtaining momentum conservation and splitting KE accordingly, whereas in relativistic case, we found an increase in T1.

The previous way gave 0.005 GeV difference. So in conclusion, I suppose this problem's answer is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Hence, my final answer is \boxed{0.005} GeV. Or, converted to MeV is \boxed{5} MeV. But the initial mass and the kinetic energy of 1 GeV and differences of 0.005 GeV—since GeV is given in problem, perhaps report in GeV. I think so.

But to verify units, question says "difference between correct T1 value and T1 value...", assuming all values are in GeV, so answer in GeV. So \boxed{0.005} GeV.


**Final Answer**
\boxed{0.005}

The problem involves an atomic nucleus of mass \( M = 300 \) GeV undergoing fission into two fragments with rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2m_2 \). The sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass, giving \( m_1 + m_2 = 297 \) GeV. Solving for the rest masses, we find \( m_1 = 198 \) GeV and \( m_2 = 99 \) GeV. The total kinetic energy of the fragments is 3 GeV, derived from the mass defect of 3 GeV.

Using relativistic conservation of energy and momentum, we calculate the total energy of each fragment. The energy conservation equation is \( E_1 + E_2 = 300 \) GeV, and momentum conservation gives \( E_1^2 - m_1^2 = E_2^2 - m_2^2 \). Solving these equations, we find \( E_1 = 199.005 \) GeV and \( E_2 = 100.995 \) GeV. The relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) for the more massive fragment is \( E_1 - m_1 = 1.005 \) GeV.

For the classical (non-relativistic) calculation, momentum conservation gives \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \), leading to \( v_2 = 2v_1 \). The total kinetic energy is \( 3m_2 v_1^2 = 3 \) GeV, resulting in \( m_2 v_1^2 = 1 \) GeV. The classical kinetic energy \( T_1 \) is \( \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = 1 \) GeV.

The difference between the relativistic and classical kinetic energies is \( 1.005 \) GeV - \( 1 \) GeV = \( 0.005 \) GeV.

\[
\boxed{0.005 \text{ GeV}}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Let me write that out:

(E1 - E2)(300) = (198 - 99)(297) = 99*297

So, E1 - E2 = (99*297)/300

Calculating that:

99*297: Let's compute 100*297 = 29,700, subtract 1*297 = 297, so 29,700 - 297 = 29,403.

Then, 29,403 / 300 = 29,403 ÷ 300. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3: 9,801 / 100 = 98.01 GeV.

So, E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV.

We also have E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So, solving these two equations:

E1 + E2 = 300

E1 - E2 = 98.01

Adding them:

2*E1 = 398.01 => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Then, E2 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV

So, the total energy of the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV) is E1 = 199.005 GeV. Therefore, its kinetic energy T1 is E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

Similarly, T2 = E2 - m2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV.

Check that T1 + T2 = 1.005 + 1.995 = 3 GeV, which matches the earlier result. Good.

Now, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (1.005 GeV) and the classical approximation. Let's compute the classical T1 and then subtract.

In classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)m*v^2. Momentum is m*v. Since the total momentum is zero, m1*v1 = m2*v2. So, v2 = (m1/m2)*v1. But m1 = 2*m2, v2 = 2*v1.

The total kinetic energy is (1/2)m1*v1^2 + (1/2)m2*v2^2 = (1/2)(2*m2)*v1^2 + (1/2)m2*(2*v1)^2 = m2*v1^2 + (1/2)*m2*4*v1^2 = m2*v1^2 + 2*m2*v1^2 = 3*m2*v1^2.

This total kinetic energy is given as 3 GeV (from the mass defect). So, 3*m2*v1^2 = 3 GeV. Therefore, m2*v1^2 = 1 GeV.

But m2 is 99 GeV (rest mass). Wait, but in classical physics, mass is in kg, but here we have mass in GeV/c². However, since we are working in natural units where c=1, mass and energy are in GeV. But in classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)m*v². However, in natural units, velocity is unitless (v/c), so v is in terms of c. But perhaps we need to be careful here.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in the classical calculation, the kinetic energy is (1/2)m*v², but in the units where c=1, energy is in GeV, mass is in GeV/c², so to get energy in GeV, we need to write (1/2)m*v² * c². But since c=1 in natural units, maybe it's (1/2)m*v². Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps we can proceed by using the fact that in the classical case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)m*v², and momentum is m*v. So, using the same approach as in relativity but with classical expressions.

So, in the classical case, momentum conservation gives m1*v1 = m2*v2. Since m1 = 2*m2, then 2*m2*v1 = m2*v2 => v2 = 2*v1.

Total kinetic energy T = (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2*(2v1)^2 = m2*v1² + (1/2)m2*4v1² = m2*v1² + 2*m2*v1² = 3*m2*v1².

Given that T = 3 GeV (from the mass defect), so 3*m2*v1² = 3 GeV => m2*v1² = 1 GeV.

But m2 is 99 GeV (rest mass). Wait, but m2 is 99 GeV/c². If we are using natural units (c=1), then m2 is 99 GeV. But in classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)m*v², but here, since we are using GeV for energy, and mass is in GeV/c², we need to convert units properly.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), energy, mass, and momentum have the same units. But in classical physics, kinetic energy is (1/2)m v², but if m is in GeV/c² and v is in units of c, then v is dimensionless (v/c), so the kinetic energy would be (1/2)m (v c)² / c² = (1/2)m v². Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so (v c)² is v² c², but if c=1, then it's just v². But in natural units, energy is GeV, mass is GeV/c², so to get energy in GeV, you need to multiply by c². So, (1/2)m v² c². But if c=1, then it's (1/2)m v². But m is in GeV/c², so (1/2)(GeV/c²) * v² * c² = (1/2) GeV v². So, if v is in terms of c, then v is unitless, and the kinetic energy is (1/2)m v² GeV. But m is in GeV/c², so m v² would be (GeV/c²) * (c²) = GeV. So, (1/2)m v² c². Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in natural units (c=1), the classical kinetic energy is (1/2)m v², where m is in GeV and v is a unitless fraction of the speed of light. Then, the momentum is m v. So, in the classical case, the momentum of each fragment is m1 v1 and m2 v2. Since m1 = 2 m2, and momentum conservation gives m1 v1 = m2 v2, so 2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 => v2 = 2 v1.

Total kinetic energy is (1/2)m1 v1² + (1/2)m2 v2² = (1/2)(2 m2) v1² + (1/2)m2 (2 v1)^2 = m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1².

This total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, so 3 m2 v1² = 3 GeV => m2 v1² = 1 GeV.

But m2 is 99 GeV (since m2 is 99 GeV/c², but in natural units, c=1, so m2 is 99 GeV). Therefore, 99 GeV * v1² = 1 GeV => v1² = 1/99 => v1 = 1/sqrt(99) ≈ 0.1005 (in units of c).

Then, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is (1/2)m1 v1² = (1/2)(198 GeV)(1/99) = (1/2)(198/99) GeV = (1/2)(2) GeV = 1 GeV.

Wait, that's interesting. So, in the classical calculation, T1 is 1 GeV, whereas the relativistic calculation gave T1 as 1.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

But let me verify this again. Let's check the steps.

In the classical case:

- Momentum conservation: m1*v1 = m2*v2. Since m1 = 2*m2, then 2*m2*v1 = m2*v2 => v2 = 2*v1.

- Total kinetic energy: (1/2)m1*v1² + (1/2)m2*v2² = (1/2)(2m2)v1² + (1/2)m2*(2v1)^2 = m2*v1² + 2*m2*v1² = 3*m2*v1².

- Total kinetic energy is 3 GeV, so 3*m2*v1² = 3 GeV => m2*v1² = 1 GeV.

- m2 is 99 GeV, so 99*v1² = 1 => v1² = 1/99.

- Then, T1 = (1/2)m1*v1² = (1/2)*198*(1/99) = (1/2)*(198/99) = (1/2)*2 = 1 GeV. Correct.

In the relativistic case, T1 was 1.005 GeV. So, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. Therefore, the answer is 5 MeV, or 0.005 GeV. But the problem says "the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation". So, 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV. Since the answer is likely expected in GeV, but 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV, but maybe they want it in GeV. Let's check.

But let me check the relativistic calculation again. Let's make sure that the numbers are correct.

We had:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV

Adding gives 2E1 = 398.01 GeV => E1 = 199.005 GeV

Therefore, T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. Correct.

So, the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So, 0.005 GeV. But perhaps we need to check if the calculation of E1 - E2 was correct.

Earlier, we had:

(E1 - E2) = (m1 - m2)(m1 + m2)/(E1 + E2) = (99 GeV)(297 GeV)/300 GeV.

Wait, (m1 - m2) is 198 - 99 = 99 GeV. (m1 + m2) is 297 GeV. So, (E1 - E2) = (99*297)/300.

Calculating 99*297: 99*300 = 29,700, minus 99*3 = 297, so 29,700 - 297 = 29,403. Then, 29,403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV. Correct.

So, E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV. Then, solving for E1 and E2 gives T1 = 1.005 GeV. So, the difference is indeed 0.005 GeV.

But let me check if the relativistic calculation is accurate. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. Wait, the problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. So, the rest mass energy of the fragments is 297 GeV, and the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. Therefore, the total energy of the system is conserved, so the remaining 3 GeV is the kinetic energy. So, yes, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. So, that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is not just the difference in rest mass, but the actual kinetic energy. But in reality, the total energy is conserved, so the initial rest energy (300 GeV) equals the sum of the rest energies of the fragments plus their kinetic energies. So, yes, 300 = 297 + T1 + T2. So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. Correct.

Therefore, the relativistic calculation gives T1 = 1.005 GeV, classical gives 1 GeV, so the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So, the answer is 0.005 GeV. But let me check if the problem expects the answer in GeV or MeV. The problem says "What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?" It doesn't specify units, but the original energy is given in GeV, so likely GeV. But 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. However, maybe the answer is 0.005 GeV. Let me check the calculation once more.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me check the steps again.

We have:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV

E1^2 - E2^2 = (m1^2 - m2^2)

Which is (E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1 - m2)(m1 + m2)

So, (E1 - E2) = [(m1 - m2)(m1 + m2)] / (E1 + E2) = (99 GeV * 297 GeV) / 300 GeV = (99*297)/300 GeV = 98.01 GeV. Correct.

Then, solving E1 + E2 = 300 and E1 - E2 = 98.01:

Adding equations: 2E1 = 398.01 => E1 = 199.005 GeV. Then, E2 = 300 - 199.005 = 100.995 GeV.

Therefore, T1 = E1 - m1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

T2 = E2 - m2 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV.

Sum T1 + T2 = 1.005 + 1.995 = 3 GeV. Correct.

In the classical case, T1 = 1 GeV, T2 = 2 GeV. Sum is 3 GeV. So, the difference is 0.005 GeV. So, the answer is 0.005 GeV. But let me check if there's a mistake in the classical calculation.

Wait, in the classical case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)m1*v1². But when we set up the equations, we found that m2*v1² = 1 GeV. Then, T1 = (1/2)m1*v1² = (1/2)*2*m2*v1² = m2*v1² = 1 GeV. Wait, that's different from my previous step. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, m1 = 2*m2. So, m1 = 2*m2. Then, T1 = (1/2)m1*v1² = (1/2)*2*m2*v1² = m2*v1². But from the total kinetic energy, we had 3*m2*v1² = 3 GeV => m2*v1² = 1 GeV. Therefore, T1 = m2*v1² = 1 GeV. So, yes, T1 is 1 GeV. Then, T2 = (1/2)m2*v2² = (1/2)m2*(2*v1)^2 = (1/2)m2*4*v1² = 2*m2*v1² = 2*1 GeV = 2 GeV. So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. Correct.

Therefore, the classical T1 is 1 GeV, relativistic is 1.005 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV. So, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. But the problem says to present the answer in the box, probably in GeV. So, 0.005 GeV. But let me check if there's a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe using velocities. Let's compute the velocities in the relativistic case and see if the classical calculation is a good approximation.

In the relativistic case, for the more massive fragment (m1 = 198 GeV), E1 = 199.005 GeV. Then, gamma1 = E1 / m1 = 199.005 / 198 ≈ 1.005075. Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v1²). So, sqrt(1 - v1²) = 1 / gamma => 1 - v1² = 1 / gamma² => v1² = 1 - 1 / gamma² ≈ 1 - 1 / (1.005075)^2 ≈ 1 - 1 / 1.010185 ≈ 1 - 0.9899 ≈ 0.0101. So, v1 ≈ sqrt(0.0101) ≈ 0.1005, which is about 10% the speed of light. So, v1 ≈ 0.1c. Then, the classical approximation might be reasonable, but the difference in kinetic energy is still 0.005 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach where the kinetic energy is calculated using the classical formula but with the velocities obtained from the relativistic momentum. But no, the problem says to compute the classical T1 value, which would be using the classical formula. So, the answer is 0.005 GeV.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of E1 - E2. Let me check the numbers again.

(m1 - m2) = 198 - 99 = 99 GeV.

(m1 + m2) = 297 GeV.

(E1 + E2) = 300 GeV.

So, (E1 - E2) = (99 * 297) / 300 = (99 * 297) / 300.

99 * 297: 100*297 = 29,700, minus 1*297 = 297, so 29,700 - 297 = 29,403.

29,403 / 300 = 98.01 GeV. Correct.

So, E1 = (300 + 98.01)/2 = 398.01/2 = 199.005 GeV. Correct.

Therefore, T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. Correct.

So, the difference is 0.005 GeV. So, the answer is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. But the problem says to present the answer in a box, so likely \boxed{0.005 \text{ GeV}} or \boxed{5 \text{ MeV}}. But since the original units are GeV, probably GeV. Let me check if 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Yes, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, so 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV. Either is correct, but the problem uses GeV, so maybe 0.005 GeV. But let me check if the problem expects more precise decimal places.

Wait, in the calculation, E1 - E2 was 98.01 GeV. But 99*297 = 29,403, divided by 300 is 29,403 / 300. Let me compute that more precisely. 300*98 = 29,400, so 29,403 - 29,400 = 3. So, 29,403 / 300 = 98 + 3/300 = 98.01 exactly. So, E1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV. Then, E1 = (300 + 98.01)/2 = 398.01/2 = 199.005 GeV. So, T1 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV. So, the difference is exactly 0.005 GeV. So, the answer is 0.005 GeV. Therefore, the difference is 0.005 GeV.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of a fraction. 0.005 GeV is 1/200 GeV. But 0.005 is 5*10^{-3} GeV. But likely, 0.005 GeV is acceptable.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{0.005 \text{ GeV}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0.005 \text{ GeV}}
