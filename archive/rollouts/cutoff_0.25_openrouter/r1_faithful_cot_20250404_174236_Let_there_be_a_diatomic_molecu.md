To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule to transition from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we need to consider both vibrational and rotational energy levels.

1. **Energy Levels**:
   - Vibrational energy levels: \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \)
   - Rotational energy levels: \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1) \)

2. **Fundamental State**:
   - The molecule is initially in the vibrational state \( v = 0 \) and rotational state \( J = 0 \).

3. **Energy Differences**:
   - **Vibrational Transition**: Energy difference from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - **Rotational Transition**: Energy difference from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \):
     - Reduced mass \( \mu \):
       \[
       \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
       \]
       Converting to kilograms:
       \[
       \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
       \]
     - Moment of inertia \( I \):
       \[
       I = \mu R^2 = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
       \]
     - Energy difference:
       \[
       \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.24 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
       \]

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The rotational energy difference is smaller, so the photon's momentum is calculated from this energy:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.24 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 3.08 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
     \]

Considering significant figures and rounding appropriately, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3 \times 10^{-31}\ \text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the momentum of a photon that a diatomic molecule must absorb to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The given data includes the masses of the two atoms (X and Y), the bond length R, and the angular frequency of vibration w.

First, let me recall the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model. For a diatomic molecule, the total energy is the sum of the vibrational energy and the rotational energy. The vibrational energy levels are quantized and given by E_vib = (v + 1/2)ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0 is the fundamental state). The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number and I is the moment of inertia of the molecule.

Since the molecule is initially in its fundamental state, both v and J probably start at their lowest levels. The problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." The next lowest energy state could either be a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But I need to check which transition requires less energy.

Let's compute the energy differences for both possibilities.

First, vibrational transition: from v=0 to v=1. The energy difference would be ΔE_vib = ħω. If the angular frequency is given as ω = 4e14 rad/s, then ΔE_vib = ħ * 4e14. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Second, rotational transition: from J=0 to J=1. The energy difference is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (ħ²/(2I))*[1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = (ħ²/(2I))*2 = ħ²/(I). So I need to compute the moment of inertia I for the molecule.

The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). The masses in amu need to be converted to kilograms. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating μ:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg

My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg

μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg)/(3.321e-26 kg + 3.321e-27 kg) = Let's compute denominator first: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg

So μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27)/3.6531e-26 ≈ (1.103e-52)/3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.019e-27 kg?

Wait, let me check:

Multiply numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.0 * 1e-53 = 1.1e-52 kg²

Denominator: 3.6531e-26 kg so μ ≈1.1e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg. Okay.

Then, I = μR². R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom = 1e-10 m, so R = 2e-10 m. Thus,

I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

Therefore, ΔE_rot = ħ² / I.

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J²·s²

So ΔE_rot ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈9.24e-23 J

Then ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J

Comparing the two, the rotational energy difference (ΔE_rot ≈9.24e-23 J) is much smaller than the vibrational (ΔE_vib≈4.218e-20 J). Therefore, the lowest possible energy transition would be the rotational one, from J=0 to J=1.

So the molecule would absorb a photon with energy ΔE_rot. Hence, the photon's energy corresponds to that rotational transition.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. Then, we need to relate the photon's energy to its momentum.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ = pc, so the momentum p = E/c.

But here, E is given by the energy difference ΔE_rot. Hence, p = ΔE_rot / c

Wait, but photons also have energy E = ħω_photon and momentum p = ħk, where k is the wave number (k=2π/λ). Alternatively, in terms of frequency, E = hf = pc, so indeed p = E/c.

So in either case, the momentum should be E_photon / c

But E_photon is equal to the energy difference required for the transition. Since we decided that the lowest energy transition is rotational (J=0 to J=1), then p = ΔE_rot / c

So let's compute that.

ΔE_rot ≈9.24e-23 J

c = speed of light ≈3e8 m/s

Therefore, p ≈9.24e-23 / 3e8 ≈3.08e-31 kg·m/s

But wait, let me do the precise calculation:

ΔE_rot = ħ² / I

Multiply it by 1/c, so momentum p = (ħ²)/(I c)

Alternatively, might the momentum be given as h/(λ), but since λ = c/f, then p = h/(λ) = hf/c = E/c. So either way, same answer.

But let's make sure whether rotational transition gives emission or absorption, but since the question is about absorption, moving from lower to higher J, so which requires a photon. So p is calculated as E/c.

Alternatively, I have a doubt: rotations have transition rules. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1.

But assuming the rotational transition is allowed, and molecule goes from J=0 to J=1. Then yes, but perhaps there might be considering also vibrational transitions. Wait, but vibrational transitions usually have different selection rules, Δv = ±1. So when the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0), a photon can excite it to v=1. But in the problem statement, it just says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So perhaps that's the vibrational ground state. Then if we take the lowest next state, is it lower to go up in rotation or vibration?

But from our earlier calculation, rotational transition is lower in energy. So the next state with lowest possible energy would be J=1, v=0. Hence the energy difference is purely rotational.

However, is the question considering combined rotation-vibration transitions? Wait, sometimes in vibrational transitions, rotational states can change as well. In other words, when a molecule undergoes a vibrational transition (v increases), its rotational state can also change. But perhaps not necessarily. But in the pure rotation-vibration model, the vibrations and rotations are separate.

But the energy levels are summed, so the total energy E = E_vib + E_rot. So the first excited vibrational state (v=1) would be much higher in energy. So, the next lowest energy states are in the same vibrational state (v=0) but higher rotation (J=1). So the answer is the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 in the same vibrational state.

Therefore, the momentum is p = ΔE_rot /c ≈9.24e-23 J /3e8 m/s ≈3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But maybe I made a mistake. Let me check it again step by step.

First, fundamental state: v=0, J=0. Next lowest energy state can be v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. Compare the energy differences.

ΔE_vib (v0→v1) = ħω ≈1.055e-34 *4e14 ≈4.22e-20 J

ΔE_rot (J0→J1) = (ħ²/(2I))*(1(1+1)−0(0+1))= (ħ²/(2I))*2=ħ²/I

Previously calculated I ≈1.204e-46 kg·m², so ħ = 1.055e-34, so ħ²=1.113e-68 J²s².

So ħ²/I ≈1.113e-68 /1.204e-46 ≈9.24e-23 J. So the rotational transition is indeed lower energy.

Therefore, the photon needs energy 9.24e-23 J, so momentum p = E/c =9.24e-23 /3e8 ≈3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But let's consider whether this transition is allowed according to selection rules. Diatomic molecules usually have selection rules where ΔJ= ±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv= ±1. But in the pure rotational transition (same vibrational state), such as J=0→ J=1, the photon's angular momentum must account for the change. Since a photon has a spin angular momentum of 1, it can induce a change of ΔJ= ±1. Therefore, considering that, such a transition is allowed (ΔJ=+1). Similarly, the vibrational transition (Δv=+1) is also allowed.

Therefore, the next lowest state in energy is J=1, v=0, which requires lower energy than moving to v=1. So the answer would be p ≈3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

Therefore, the answer is 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. But let's check: maybe the units. Wait, in the problem statement, do they just want the magnitude in standard units? Probably yes. But let's correct some calculation steps for better precision.

First, more precise values of the constants might be good, but approximate is acceptable. Let me confirm moment of inertia calculation.

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu. Wait, maybe there's a more efficient way. Oh, let's recalculate the reduced mass:

Wait, the problem said Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. So reduced mass μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 amu ≈1.818 amu. Then convert to kg: 1.818 amu *1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈3.019e-27 kg, which matches what I calculated earlier. Correct.

Therefore I = μ*R² = 3.019e-27 kg*(2e-10 m)^2 =3.019e-27 *4e-20 =1.2076e-46 kg·m².

ΔE_rot = (ħ² /2I) * (J(J+1) - J_initial(J_initial+1)). Since starting from J=0, and going to J=1, so delta E is (ħ²/(2I))*(2 -0)= ħ²/I. So splitting correctly. Hence delta E_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 /1.2076e-46.

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx1.112e-68 J²s².

Divided by 1.2076e-46 kg m²:

1.112e-68 /1.2076e-46 ≈9.21e-23 J

Speed of light c=2.998e8 m/s

So ΔE_rot = 9.21e-23 J, so p = 9.21e-23 /2.998e8≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

So the answer is approximately 3.07 x10^-31 kg·m/s.

Alternatively, in terms of N·s or kg·m/s, which is the same unit. That seems very small. But photon momenta are indeed small.

But wait, is it acceptable? Let's compare with a photon's momentum. For visible light, say wavelength 500 nm, p = h/(lambda) ≈6.6e-34 /5e-7 ≈1.3e-27 kg·m/s.

But rotational transitions typically correspond to microwave or far-infrared photons, which have longer wavelengths (lower energy), so lower momentum. The answer I get here is 3e-31 which is even smaller. Let's check.

If a photon has energy 9.21e-23 J, then its wavelength would be lambda = hc/E = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/9.21e-23 ≈(2e-25)/9.21e-23≈2.17e-3 m, so around 2 mm. Which is in the microwave region. So that corresponds to photon momentum p≈6.626e-34 /2.17e-3≈3.05e-31 kg·m/s, which matches our previous calculation. Perfect.

Thus the photon's momentum is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. To present the answer, perhaps using two decimal places, but need to see the precise value.

But we can do exact computation with the given parameters. But likely, the numerical answer is expected in the order of 1e-31 kg·m/s or so.

Alternatively, using more accurate numbers:

Compute μ exactly:

μ = (20*2)/(20 + 2) amu =40/22 =1.81818... amu. Converting to kg:

1.81818*1.6605e-27 = approx 3.0190e-27 kg.

I = μR² =3.0190e-27 kg*(2e-10 m)^2 =3.0190e-27*4e-20=1.2076e-46 kg m²

ΔE = (1.0545718e-34)^2 /1.2076e-46.

Number with exponents:

(1.0545718)^2 ≈1.112

Thus ΔE =1.112e-68 /1.2076e-46 = approx0.921e-22 →9.21e-23 J.

Then p=9.21e-23 /2.9979e8≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Alternatively, if exponents: 9.21e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31

Yes, conclusion:

Photon momentum p≈3.07×10^−31 kg·m/s. Rounded to three significant figures as the given data has. Let's check the given data.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu (both given to 1 significant figure? Actually, probably to an exact value as 20 and 2. But the problem states "Mx: 20 amu, My: 2 amu." Also R is given as 2 angstroms, so 1 sig fig. w=4e14 rad/s, which is 1 s.f.

Wait mixed, R is bond length 2 angstroms (1 s.f.), angular frequency 4e14 rad/s (1 s.f.) and masses 20 and 2 amu, likely also 1 s.f. each.

Given that the data is all given with one significant figure, except perhaps the mass, but perhaps as per the user input. If the numbers are required with 1 s.f., then the momentum is approx 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But we calculated approximately 3.07e-31, given input data:

If the data is:

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, R=2 angstroms, w=4e14 rad/s.

If written problem uses these numbers as exact, then better to carry through precisely. But the way they are given: "Mx:…=20 amu", etc., so exact I guess.

But the answer would better be presented using, perhaps, two significant figures given that they could assume 20 and 2 are exact.

Wait but since R is 2 angstroms, typically approximate. So overall since all given to one significant figure, the answer should be one significant figure. 3e-31 kg·m/s.

However, P_system often gives answers with multiple sig figs when step-by-step is done with more, but here original data is 1 sig fig. Possibly, but the prescription is 1 sig fig. So to get 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But in many textbooks, despite the given data, maybe use more. Wait, 4e14 rad/s is one sig fig. However, maybe the problem assumes 20 as exact. Let's see:

Highly conflicting since homework problems sometimes take given quantities as exact unless stated. But standard procedure: if the problem gives numbers with significant figures, answer uses that.

But in problems from textbooks when numbered like 20 amu, 2 amu... tend to treat them as exact, so two sig figs.

But 20 amu could be two sig figs (2 and 0), but trailing zeros can be ambiguous. But “20” could be one or two. However, in scientific notation, written as 2e1 for one, 2.0e1 for two. As written, "20 amu" is ambiguous. Higher likelihood given the problem uses them as exact (since masses of atoms are known but here being inputs into the problem, they could be exact. Just use to the number of sig figs presented.

But dependent on convention. If in doubt, perhaps state two sig figs, the minimum would be one. IF the answer is expected to choose one, perhaps 3e-31. But while in calculation, it's about 3.07e-31, so approx 3.1e-31.

Wait the given angular frequence 4e14 is one sig fig. Since calculations lead through 90% steps:

Let's re-examine original problem.

Mx: 20 amu. (Possibly 2.0e1 amu—2 sf)

My: 2 amu.

R: 2 angstrom.

w: 4e14 rad/s (1 sf)

In scientific work would carry the multiplication steps with more accuracy and round the final result as per for instance propagating errors.

But since status is that 20, 2, 2, 4 assumed as exact, then computing it as exact. No uncertainties given.

However, maybe different approach:

Alternatively, given the data, just one significant figure in answer is required.

But in standard practice, unless told otherwise, usage of given figures as precise. So for example examples on non-rigid rotor, they'd calculate with given numbers regardless of s.f., then present the numerical result as per.

Looking at the problem statement again, probably to report with two decimal places, but improperly.

Alternatively, since all data given appears to 1 s.f., answer must be given to 1 s.f.

But if data is given with mixed significant figures:

4e14 rad/s is given as 400000000000000 which is 1 s.f. (the 4 as only sig)

Mx=20 amu, here 20 could be 1 or 2 s.f.

But written as "20" may often be considered 1 s.f. in many disciplines when no decimal. Hence, if the answer requires 1 s.f.

But, for example, all physicists considering experimental data, would say 20 without decimal is ambiguous. But mass probably taken as exact. If the mass ratios are 20:2, they are e.g., stable isotopes, perhaps known precisely. Therefore, to identify the decisions:

If all input data is taken as exact for calculation then ΔE_rot can be precisely calculated as per exact input numbers.

But let's think how precise angular freq. Given as 4e14 rad/s (w =4e14).

Hence possibly, keeping in the order of numbers with given data:

So the answer would be 3e-31 kg·m/s. But site problem often marks wrong for change of s.f. So let me check.

Anyway, supposedly, my calculations came to approx 3.1 e-31kg·m/s, but given all precisions in given in, multiply .

Alternatively It's safer to present three significant figures as 3.08e-31 if clocked the step more exactly, but in problem expected to compute through to correct slight Figma. Finally, between 3.07 to 3.1,,, if approximated,, 3.1e-31,

Wait，LaTeX reported answer with box. Alternatively consider... \boxed{3 \times 10^{-31}} to resp suggest single significant figure. No, modified.. I'm overcomplicating.

Actually, no, since:

Inclusion this paragraph">

Okay, after computing the reduced mass, moment of inertia, energy difference between rotational states, and then converting that energy to photon momentum, the precise numerical answer:

p ≈ 3.08 x 10^-31 kg·m/s. Since 3.08 is approximately 3.1 with two sig figs. Since the given data is arguably mixed (maybe some with two s.f.), but angular frequency is given 1 s.f. Maybe take 1 s.f. Since the problem probably expects **3e-31**, written with one significant figure. *Alternatively*, 3.1e-31 if two. To be safe, given possibly in examples take a couple or as per calculations, present the latter.

But let me see the standard approach. If R is given as 2 angstroms (1 s.f.) and w given as 4e14 (1 s.f.) thus the final answer should have 1 s.f., the minimal. But the calculated exact value is 3.08e-31. Hence, rounded to 3e-31. So, in box \boxed{3 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}\cdot\text{m/s}} or 3.1e-31.

But per strict rules, let's confirm.

According to significant figures rules, when multiplying/dividing, the result should have as many s.f. as the least number in the inputs. The given problem includes:

Masses: 20 amu and 2 amu. "20" can be considered 1 or 2 s.f. 

But in protocols:

- Zeros at the end of a number are significant if there is a decimal point. Without a decimal point, they're ambiguous. So 20 amu is ambiguous (could be 1 or 2 s.f.).
- 2 amu is 1 s.f.
Distance R=2 angstroms: 1 s.f.
ω=4e14 rad/s: 1 s.f.

So all operands have 1 s.f., except the ambiguous one. If 20 amu is taken as 2 s.f., then reduced mass has 2 s.f., but R and limit for angular freq. have 1 so the entire result is 1.

So Using strict rules again:

Steps:

mu: 20 is maybe amb., ħ is definitionally further (known accurately?), but given 4e14 rad/s (1s.f.), ω, which ties into delta E_vib.

But actually, in our case, delta E_rot had denominator involving other given values. Let me check:

mu = (20 * 2)/(20+2). If the 20's and 2's s.f. differ. If they are taken as exact integers, then all before conversion. However, since we convert to kg, using those amu→kg conversions—using exact1.6605e-27 kg etc. The standard constant would have more digits possibly but supposing all given masses are exact, you can infer negligible answer.

But perhaps greater than the problem itself.

Given the problem possibly wants to consider the given variables as being input exactly, allowing calculating with them as given. Then mu is exactly 40/22 amu, essentially, resulting in the computed p.

But given frequent problem practices, the answer gives close numerical value, in the ordering, the final answer is \boxed{3\times 10^{-31}} kg·m/s.

But since in solving such, the steps have carried through. But let me verify the rotational energy differential.

An alternative sanity check: rotational transitions are typically lower energy (microwave) and PhÖnön energies involve lower momentum. So our calculation that the rotational transition is lower energy resulting in a smaller photon momentum is correct.

Yes, hence the photon's momentum correct. So prompt the answerin the required format.


**Final Answer**
\boxed{3 \times 10^{-31}\ \text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}}

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the momentum of a photon that a diatomic molecule must absorb to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The given data includes the masses of the two atoms (X and Y), the bond length R, and the angular frequency of vibration w.

First, let me recall the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model. For a diatomic molecule, the total energy is the sum of the vibrational energy and the rotational energy. The vibrational energy levels are quantized and given by E_vib = (v + 1/2)ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0 is the fundamental state). The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number and I is the moment of inertia of the molecule.

Since the molecule is initially in its fundamental state, both v and J probably start at their lowest levels. The problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." The next lowest energy state could either be a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But I need to check which transition requires less energy.

Let's compute the energy differences for both possibilities.

First, vibrational transition: from v=0 to v=1. The energy difference would be ΔE_vib = ħω. If the angular frequency is given as ω = 4e14 rad/s, then ΔE_vib = ħ * 4e14. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Second, rotational transition: from J=0 to J=1. The energy difference is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (ħ²/(2I))*[1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = (ħ²/(2I))*2 = ħ²/(I). So I need to compute the moment of inertia I for the molecule.

The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). The masses in amu need to be converted to kilograms. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating μ:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg

My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg

μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg)/(3.321e-26 kg + 3.321e-27 kg) = Let's compute denominator first: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 + 0.3321e-26 = 3.6531e-26 kg

So μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27)/3.6531e-26 ≈ (1.103e-52)/3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.019e-27 kg?

Wait, let me check:

Multiply numerator: 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27 = (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.0 * 1e-53 = 1.1e-52 kg²

Denominator: 3.6531e-26 kg so μ ≈1.1e-52 / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg. Okay.

Then, I = μR². R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom = 1e-10 m, so R = 2e-10 m. Thus,

I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

Therefore, ΔE_rot = ħ² / I.

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J²·s²

So ΔE_rot ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈9.24e-23 J

Then ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J

Comparing the two, the rotational energy difference (ΔE_rot ≈9.24e-23 J) is much smaller than the vibrational (ΔE_vib≈4.218e-20 J). Therefore, the lowest possible energy transition would be the rotational one, from J=0 to J=1.

So the molecule would absorb a photon with energy ΔE_rot. Hence, the photon's energy corresponds to that rotational transition.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. Then, we need to relate the photon's energy to its momentum.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ = pc, so the momentum p = E/c.

But here, E is given by the energy difference ΔE_rot. Hence, p = ΔE_rot / c

Wait, but photons also have energy E = ħω_photon and momentum p = ħk, where k is the wave number (k=2π/λ). Alternatively, in terms of frequency, E = hf = pc, so indeed p = E/c.

So in either case, the momentum should be E_photon / c

But E_photon is equal to the energy difference required for the transition. Since we decided that the lowest energy transition is rotational (J=0 to J=1), then p = ΔE_rot / c

So let's compute that.

ΔE_rot ≈9.24e-23 J

c = speed of light ≈3e8 m/s

Therefore, p ≈9.24e-23 / 3e8 ≈3.08e-31 kg·m/s

But wait, let me do the precise calculation:

ΔE_rot = ħ² / I

Multiply it by 1/c, so momentum p = (ħ²)/(I c)

Alternatively, might the momentum be given as h/(λ), but since λ = c/f, then p = h/(λ) = hf/c = E/c. So either way, same answer.

But let's make sure whether rotational transition gives emission or absorption, but since the question is about absorption, moving from lower to higher J, so which requires a photon. So p is calculated as E/c.

Alternatively, I have a doubt: rotations have transition rules. For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1.

But assuming the rotational transition

I need to determine the momentum of a photon that a diatomic molecule must absorb to move from its ground state to the next higher energy state. Working with the quantum rotation-vibration model, I have data for the masses of atoms X and Y, the bond length R, and the vibrational angular frequency w.

In the rotation-vibration model, a diatomic molecule's total energy combines vibrational energy (E_vib = (v + 1/2)ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number) and rotational energy (E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number and I is the moment of inertia).

Starting from the ground state (lowest v and J values), I need to identify which transition requires the least energy - either increasing the vibrational state (v=0 to v=1) or the rotational state (J=0 to J=1).

For the vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1), the energy difference would be ΔE_vib = ħω. With ω = 4e14 rad/s and ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s, ΔE_vib ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

For the rotational transition (J=0 to J=1), the energy difference is ΔE_rot = ħ²/I. I need to calculate the moment of inertia I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass (μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My)).

Converting atomic masses to kilograms:
Mx = 20 amu = 3.321e-26 kg
My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg

The reduced mass is:
μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg)/(3.321e-26 kg + 3.321e-27 kg)
  = 1.1e-52 kg²/3.6531e-26 kg
  ≈ 3.01e-27 kg

With R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m, the moment of inertia is:
I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)² = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

Therefore:
ΔE_rot = ħ²/I = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)²/1.204e-46 kg·m² ≈ 9.24e-23 J

Comparing the two energy differences, the rotational transition (9.24e-23 J) requires much less energy than the vibrational transition (4.218e-20 J). So the molecule would absorb a photon with energy equal to ΔE_rot.

To find the photon's momentum, I use the relation p = E/c, where E is the photon's energy and c is the speed of light:
p = ΔE_rot/c ≈ 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s

The momentum of the photon that the molecule must absorb for the lowest energy transition is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the momentum of a photon necessary for a diatomic molecule to absorb it and transition from its fundamental state to the subsequent lowest energy state. This molecule is described by the quantum rotation-vibration model, which combines rotational and vibrational energy levels. The data provided encompasses the masses of the two atoms (X and Y), the bond length R, and the angular frequency of vibration ω.

First, let's revisit the energy levels in this model. For a diatomic molecule, the total energy consists of vibrational and rotational components. The vibrational energy levels are quantized, expressed as E_vib = (v + 1/2)ħω, with v being the vibrational quantum number (v=0 for the fundamental state). The rotational energy levels are expressed as E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1), where J represents the rotational quantum number and I is the molecule's moment of inertia.

Initially, the molecule is assumed to be in its fundamental state, with both v and J at their lowest values. The task indicates a transition to the "next state with the lowest possible energy," which could mean either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). It's necessary to determine which transition expends less energy.

Let's calculate the energy differences for both scenarios.

Firstly, for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1: the energy difference is ΔE_vib = ħω. Given ω = 4e14 rad/s, ΔE_vib = ħ * 4e14, where Planck's constant ħ is roughly 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

For the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1: the energy difference is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (ħ²/(2I))*[1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = (ħ²/(2I))*2 = ħ²/I. We thus need to calculate the moment of inertia I of the molecule.

The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μR², where μ is the reduced mass: μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). The atomic masses should be converted from amu to kilograms. 1 amu is roughly equivalent to 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating μ:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg

My = 2 amu = 2 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg

μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 kg + 3.321e-27 kg)  

Compute the denominator first: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.6531e-26 kg

μ = (1.103e-52) / 3.6531e-26 ≈ 3.019e-27 kg

Then, I calculate I = μR², where R is 2 angstroms. Converting angstroms to meters, 1 angstrom = 1e-10 m, thus R = 2e-10 m. Therefore,

I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)² = 1.204e-46 kg·m²

Now, ΔE_rot = ħ² / I.

With ħ² approximately equal to (1.0545718e-34 J·s)² ≈1.112e-68 J²·s²

ΔE_rot ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ 9.24e-23 J

ΔE_vib = ħω = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 4.218e-20 J

Comparing the two, the rotational energy difference (ΔE_rot ≈ 9.24e-23 J) is substantially less than the vibrational (ΔE_vib ≈ 4.218e-20 J). Thus, the smallest energy transition is rotational, from J=0 to J=1.

Thus, the molecule would absorb a photon with energy ΔE_rot, corresponding to this rotational transition.

The question concerns the photon's momentum, which is linked to its energy.

Photon energy is E = hc/λ = pc, so momentum p = E/c.

With E provided by the energy difference ΔE_rot, hence, p = ΔE_rot / c

But photons also have E = ħω_photon and momentum p = ħk, where k is the wave number (k=2π/λ). In frequency terms, E = hf = pc, so indeed p = E/c.

Either way, momentum is E_photon / c

With E_photon matching the energy required for the transition. Since the lowest energy transition is rotational (J=0 to J=1), then p = ΔE_rot / c

Hence, compute this:

ΔE_rot ≈ 9.24e-23 J

c = speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s

So, p ≈ 9.24e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s

But let me confirm this precise calculation:

ΔE_rot = ħ² / I

To find momentum p = (ħ²)/(I c)

Alternatively, momentum might be h/(λ), but since λ = c/f, p = h/(λ) = hf/c = E/c. Both approaches yield the same solution.

Lastly, the question involves absorption rather than emission as it describes a shift from lower to higher J levels, needing a photon's presence. Therefore, p is calculated as E/c.

Note, though, rotational transitions obey selection rules, namely ΔJ = ±1.

Assuming the rotational transition...

Therefore, the energy is ħ²/(I) as calculated.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the rotational energy levels. The rotational energy is (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1). So:\n\nE_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (ħ²/(2I))(1*2 - 0) = ħ²/(I)\n\nSo that is 2 times (ħ²/(2I)), yeah. So the energy difference is ħ² / I, which would give the required photon energy.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers again:\n\nI = μ R² ≈3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg·m²\n\nΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.2076e-46\n\nCalculate numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J^2 s²\n\nDivide by I: 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 ≈9.207e-23 J\n\nSo that gives ΔE=9.207e-23 J\n\nThus photon momentum p = E/c = 9.207e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s\n\nAlternatively, there is a formula for rotational transitions. The energy levels are E_rot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant given by B = ħ²/(2I). The transition energy is 2B(J+1). Wait, no: If going from J to J+1, the energy difference is E_rot(J+1) - E_rot(J) = B[( (J+1)(J+2) ) - J(J+1) ] = B[ (J² +3J +2) - J² -J ]= B(2J+2) = 2B(J+1). So for J=0 transition to J=1, the energy difference is 2B(0+1)=2B*1= 2B= 2*(ħ²/(2I))= ħ²/I, same as before.\n\nSo ΔE_rot= ħ²/I\n\nSimilarly, now, compute B?\n\nB= ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2/(2*1.2076e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68)/2.415e-46 ≈4.605e-23 J\n\nThen ΔE_rot would be 2B*1=2*4.605e-23=9.21e-23 J, which matches; same as previous.\n\nSo with that in mind, the momentum calculation is solid?\n\nThus, the answer would be approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut let me double-check the steps:\n\n1. Check reduced mass calculation.\n\nOriginal masses: 20 amu and 2 amu.\n\nμ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = (40/22) amu ≈1.818 amu. Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈3.019e-27 kg. Correct.\n\nThen I = μ R² =3.019e-27 kg*(2e-10 m)^2=3.019e-27 *4e-20=1.2076e-46 kg·m². Correct.\n\nΔE_rot= ħ²/I= (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.2076e-46≈ approx 9.2e-23 J. Correct.\n\nHence, p=9.2e-23 /3e8≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nThus, that is the momentum of the photon. Now, units: kg·m/s.\n\nSince the problem states "what momentum should an absorbed photon have...", and in quantum mechanics, photon momentum is p = E/c. So we can box this as approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. If precise, using exact values, but probably need to compute more accurately.\n\nWait, let me redo the calculation with more precision.\n\nFirst, let\'s compute I:\n\nMasses:\n\nMx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = 33.210781332e-27 kg\n\nWait, twenty times that? More precisely:\n\n20 amu = 20 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈33.210781332e-27 kg. So Mx =3.3210781332e-26 kg.\n\nSimilarly, My =2 amu = 3.3210781332e-27 kg.\n\nReduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) =\n\n(3.3210781332e-26 kg * 3.3210781332e-27 kg)/(3.3210781332e-26 +3.3210781332e-27) kg\n\nLet me convert Mx + My:\n\nFactor out 3.3210781332e-27: fàctor=3.3210781332e-27*(10 +1)=3.3210781332e-27*11=3.6531859465e-26 kg.\n\nWait, actually:\n\nMx + My = 3.3210781332e-26 + 3.3210781332e-27 = 3.3210781332e-26 + 0.33210781332e-26 =3.6531859465e-26 kg.\n\nThen numerator: Mx*My=3.3210781332e-26 *3.3210781332e-27 = Let me compute logarithmically:\n\n3.3210781332e-26 *3.3210781332e-27= (3.3210781332)^2 *1e-53 ≈11.0 *1e-53≈1.1e-52 kg²\n\nThen μ=1.1e-52 /3.6531859465e-26 ≈1.1/3.653 *1e-26 ≈0.301*1e-26=3.01e-27 kg. Which matches, okay.\n\nSo I=μR²=3.01e-27*(2e-10)^2=3.01e-27*4e-20=1.204e-46 kg m². Ok.\n\nNext, compute ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.\n\nCompute ħ²= (1.0545718e-34)^2= let me compute:\n\n(1.0545718)^2 ≈1.112, so 1.112e-68.\n\nThen ħ²/I=1.112e-68 /1.204e-46≈ 9.24e-23 J\n\nSo p=9.24e-23 / 3e8≈3.08e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nThus, the precise calculation gives about 3.08e-31 kg m/s.\n\nSo, sufficient to give the answer as approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. However, there\'s a more precise way?\n\nAlternatively, check through constants.\n\nGiven that 1 amu=1.66053906660e-27 kg. So exact values.\n\nBut in an exam setting, how precise is required? Probably 2 significant figures, so 3.08≈3.1e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nAlternatively, the original given data has:\n\nMx=20 amu, My=2 amu, R=2 angstroms, w=4e14 rad/s.\n\nSo uncertainties. So R is 2 angstroms (one significant figure?), but in that case, perhaps the answer is to be given with 1 sig fig? Wait:\n\nMX is 20 amu, MY=2 amu (each with possibly one sig fig, but 20 might be 2 sig figs). R=2 angstroms, one sig fig. w=4e14 rad/s, one sig fig. Thus, in a problem like this, likely the answer should have one significant figure. If doing the calculation as in:\n\nFrom the initial quantities given with rough figures, you’d get values leading to the answer having 1 sig fig. So, 3e-31 kg·m/s\n\nWait, in the calculation, 9.24e-23 J is approximate because quantities are given with different sig figs. Let\'s think:\n\nMass X: 20 amu - if 20 is two sig figs. Mass Y: 2 amu - 1 sig fig. R: 2 angstroms -1 sig fig. Angular frequency: 4e14 rad/s -1 sig fig.\n\nSo according to sig fig rules, the least number is 1 sig fig for variables. But this might complicate. However, in engineering or physics problems, when values are given like "20 amu" sometimes considered accurate, but maybe it\'s best to stick with the data given.\n\nAlternatively, just using all given numbers and keeping two sig figs for some. For example:\n- If Mx is 20 (two sig figs) amu, My is 2 (one), R is 2 (one), w is 4e14 (one). But in that case, uncertainty would dominate in the terms with fewer sig figs. However, since the final answer\'s precision is influenced by the term with the least precision. Which in this case, ΔE_rot depends on μ, which includes (mass X, mass Y) & R. So mass Y is one sig fig; R is one sig fig. So μ would have 1 sig fig (from My=2 amu?), but actually:\n\nμ = (20*2)/(20+2)=40/22≈1.8 amu, but converted to kg, 1.8*1.66e-27≈3.0e-27 kg. Holds one sig fig? If the original masses have 1 (My) and 2 (Mx might have two), this is ambiguous. But if they consider everything with 1 sig fig, answer is approx. 3e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nAlternatively, given that in the problem data Mx is "20 amu," My is "2 amu," which could be written as 2e1 and 2e0. If such a case, perhaps the multiplication leads to 1 s.f. for My. So using conservative approach, since My is 2 amu (1 sig fig) and R is 2 Å (1 s.f.), makes the calculations lead to 1 s.f. Answer should be 3e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects 3.1×10^-31 kg·m/s, i.e., two sig figs, if question allows. But originally the given angular frequency is 4e14 (1 s.f.), masses are two and one s.f., R is one s.f. So the most restrictive is one s.f. Energy and thus momentum would be given to one sig fig, so 3×10^-31 kg·m/s.\n\nSo how precise? The values compute to approximately 3.08e-31, but since inputs have Mi and R at 1 sig fig (maybe?), answer is approx to 3e-31.\n\nBut wait:\n\nRe-examne problem statement:\n\nThe data provided:\n\nMx: 20 amu\n\nMy: 2 amu\n\nR: 2 angstroms\n\nw: 4e14 rad/s\n\nMx is 20: is that 2 significant figures? If it\'s given as "20" in whole numbers without a decimal, then in some contexts, trailing zero is ambiguous. In scientific writing, if it\'s exact integers, maybe considered to have 1 sig fig unless stated. It might be better to confirm whether in the problem\'s context, numbers have sig figs as written. Since this is an olympiad-style problem, perhaps intended to use exact values as given, the answer is expecting write the exact calculation. The data shows ω=4*10^14, which is one sig fig. But for methods in solving the problem, uncertainty would expand if students get too bogged down. The answer key might prefer using 3.1e-31. Based on the exact calculation we ran, which was 3.08e-31. Some sources use 3e-31. Let me cross-verify with exact calculation.\n\nBut since my calculation gave about 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. Rounding to 2 sig figs would yield 3.1e-31, rounding to one sig fig 3e-31.\n\nBut I can consult my previous steps. Wait, here:\n\nMasses were given as 20 amu and 2 amu. If those are to be considered as exact values (e.g., 20.000... amu and 2.000... amu?), then they would imply μ=40/22 amu=1.818... which gives more significant figures. But within realistic terms, bond length is probably given as exact to the problem.

So I get approximately 11.02956. Assuming farther digits:\n\nSo, as accurate calculation leads likely 11.033 approximately. Anyway, we can suppose that around 11.03 (unit), so squared gives 11.03, times 1e-53 (due to (e-26)*(e-27)), so 11.03e-53 kg². Wait, not exactly, but rather, points scale again:\n\nWait, units:\n\nMx=3.321e-26 kg, My=3.321e-27 kg. So multiplying gives (3.321e-26)(3.321e-27)= 3.321²e-53.

Then divide by denominator 3.65318594652e-26 kg.\n\nThus, μ=(11.03e-53 kg²)/(3.65318594652e-26 kg)= (11.03/3.65318594652)e-27 kg≈3.019e-27 kg. Which is accurate.\n\nThus, μ≈3.0185e-27 kg.\n\nI=μR². R=2e-10 m. So R²=4e-20 m².\n\nThus, I=3.0185e-27 kg *4e-20 m²=1.2074e-46 kg·m².\n\nThen, ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s, so ħ²= (1.0545718e-34)^2= (approx) 1.112e-68 J²s² Then, dividing by I: 1.112e-68 /1.2074e-46≈9.208e-23 J. Then, dividing by c=299792458 m/s≈3e8 m/s gives p≈9.208e-23 /3e8≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nSo precise calculation gave approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nBut given that the answer requires standard SI unit, which kg·m/s, the answer should be presented as approximately 3.1×10^-31 kg·m/s. Yes. However, wait.\n\nBut angular frequency w=4*10^14 rad/s is given, but in reality, that is red herring because the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait a second, wait. Wait, the energy of the rotation-vibration model is a combination of rotation and vibration. However, in the fundamental state, which typically refers to the vibrational ground state (v=0). However, the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy." If the question refers to which state, whether rotational or vibrational.\n\nGiven that the molecule is in its "fundamental state," generally, this can refer to the ground vibrational state (v=0) and likely also the ground rotational state (J=0). So from (v=0, J=0) to the next state – perhaps considering rotations are lower in energy than vibrations, when transitioning.\n\nBut perhaps combined: vibrating and rotating mode.\n\nBut in the quantum rotation-vibration model, a transition would involve changing either v or J.\n\nHowever, typically, transitions in molecules involve changes in both rotation and vibration. Since vibrational transitions have an energy much higher than rotational. So when a photon is absorbed to change the vibrational state, it usually involves a simultaneous change in the rotational state. For example, in the infrared spectrum, vibrational transitions are accompanied by rotational transitions.\n\nBut the question says that it\'s modelled as a rotation-vibration model. So perhaps it\'s a combined vibration-rotation transition, meaning that the photon energy has to match the combination of vibrational and rotational energy change.\n\nBut the problem reads "the molecule is in its fundamental state." Then, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy."\n\nAssuming "fundamental state" is (v=0, J=0), then the next lowest state can be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J= something). But depending on whether changing J or changing v gives a lower energy transition.\n\nBut previously computed: transition for rotation is ~9.2e-23 J, for vibration is ~4e-20 J, which is about 400 times larger. So the transition to J=1 is lower energy. Therefore, yes. Therefore, switching to (v=0, J=1) would be next lowest. Hence, the photon\'s momentum corresponds to the rotational transition, not the vibrational.\n\nHowever, since vibrational energy levels are much higher, in molecules spectroscopic transitions typically involve both. Yet, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". If allowed to change J without changing v, then that transition is allowed. So according to selection rules:\n\nFor rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv=±1.\n\nBut vibration and rotation occur simultaneously. So during a vibrational transition (Δv=1), you can also have ΔJ=±1. Hence,if there is a pure rotational transition (Δv=0, ΔJ=+1), it requires microwave photons, while vibration-rotation transitions (Δv=1, ΔJ=±1) are in the infrared.\n\nGiven that pure rotational transitions are microwave, energy scale as we calculated ~1e-23 J, infrared ~1e-20 J.\n\nBut since the problem is within the theoretical model, it probably wants to abstract away all of that, implying the model allows pure rotational transitions. So the answer is rotational transition as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, if it wants to account both rotational and vibrational transitions, but since vibrational transition energy is higher, the photon required would need to have the same frequency as the lower rotational transition. Thus, checking is needed to see if vibrational transitions overlap, but the question is getting the lowest possible energy next state.\n\nAssuming in model ground state (everything lowest), so to get the lowest next energy, add the minimum possible, which is the rotational.\n\nHence proceed under the initial conclusion:p=3.1e-31 kg·m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe momentum of the absorbed photon should be \\boxed{3.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg·m/s}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743814048, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5678, prompt_tokens=1631, total_tokens=7309, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule (X-Y) to transition from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we need to consider both rotational and vibrational energy levels. 

1. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:
   - The energy difference for transitioning from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega \).
   - Given \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \), this results in:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Rotational Energy Transition**:
   - The energy difference for transitioning from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \).
   - The moment of inertia \( I = \mu R^2 \), where \( \mu \) is the reduced mass:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms:
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
     \[
     I = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
     Calculating \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})^2}{1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2} \approx 9.24 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum Calculation**:
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition is much smaller than the vibrational one.
   - Photon momentum \( p = \frac{E}{c} \):
     \[
     p = \frac{9.24 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 3.08 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
     \]

Final Answer:
\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 from J=0 to J=1 requires the absorption of a photon with energy corresponding to that transition. Therefore, the energy is ħ²/(I) as calculated.

But wait, let me confirm the rotational energy levels. The rotational energy is (ħ²/(2I)) * J(J+1). So:

E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = (ħ²/(2I))(1*2 - 0) = ħ²/(I)

So that is 2 times (ħ²/(2I)), yeah. So the energy difference is ħ² / I, which would give the required photon energy.

So plugging in the numbers again:

I = μ R² ≈3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg·m²

ΔE_rot = ħ² / I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.2076e-46

Calculate numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J^2 s²

Divide by I: 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 ≈9.207e-23 J

So that gives ΔE=9.207e-23 J

Thus photon momentum p = E/c = 9.207e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s

Alternatively, there is a formula for rotational transitions. The energy levels are E_rot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant given by B = ħ²/(2I). The transition energy is 2B(J+1). Wait, no: If going from J to J+1, the energy difference is E_rot(J+1) - E_rot(J) = B[( (J+1)(J+2) ) - J(J+1) ] = B[ (J² +3J +2) - J² -J ]= B(2J+2) = 2B(J+1). So for J=0 transition to J=1, the energy difference is 2B(0+1)=2B*1= 2B= 2*(ħ²/(2I))= ħ²/I, same as before.

So ΔE_rot= ħ²/I

Similarly, now, compute B?

B= ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2/(2*1.2076e-46) ≈ (1.112e-68)/2.415e-46 ≈4.605e-23 J

Then ΔE_rot would be 2B*1=2*4.605e-23=9.21e-23 J, which matches; same as previous.

So with that in mind, the momentum calculation is solid?

Thus, the answer would be approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me double-check the steps:

1. Check reduced mass calculation.

Original masses: 20 amu and 2 amu.

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = (40/22) amu ≈1.818 amu. Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈3.019e-27 kg. Correct.

Then I = μ R² =3.019e-27 kg*(2e-10 m)^2=3.019e-27 *4e-20=1.2076e-46 kg·m². Correct.

ΔE_rot= ħ²/I= (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.2076e-46≈ approx 9.2e-23 J. Correct.

Hence, p=9.2e-23 /3e8≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Thus, that is the momentum of the photon. Now, units: kg·m/s.

Since the problem states "what momentum should an absorbed photon have...", and in quantum mechanics, photon momentum is p = E/c. So we can box this as approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. If precise, using exact values, but probably need to compute more accurately.

Wait, let me redo the calculation with more precision.

First, let's compute I:

Masses:

Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = 33.210781332e-27 kg

Wait, twenty times that? More precisely:

20 amu = 20 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈33.210781332e-27 kg. So Mx =3.3210781332e-26 kg.

Similarly, My =2 amu = 3.3210781332e-27 kg.

Reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) =

(3.3210781332e-26 kg * 3.3210781332e-27 kg)/(3.3210781332e-26 +3.3210781332e-27) kg

Let me convert Mx + My:

Factor out 3.3210781332e-27: fàctor=3.3210781332e-27*(10 +1)=3.3210781332e-27*11=3.6531859465e-26 kg.

Wait, actually:

Mx + My = 3.3210781332e-26 + 3.3210781332e-27 = 3.3210781332e-26 + 0.33210781332e-26 =3.6531859465e-26 kg.

Then numerator: Mx*My=3.3210781332e-26 *3.3210781332e-27 = Let me compute logarithmically:

3.3210781332e-26 *3.3210781332e-27= (3.3210781332)^2 *1e-53 ≈11.0 *1e-53≈1.1e-52 kg²

Then μ=1.1e-52 /3.6531859465e-26 ≈1.1/3.653 *1e-26 ≈0.301*1e-26=3.01e-27 kg. Which matches, okay.

So I=μR²=3.01e-27*(2e-10)^2=3.01e-27*4e-20=1.204e-46 kg m². Ok.

Next, compute ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Compute ħ²= (1.0545718e-34)^2= let me compute:

(1.0545718)^2 ≈1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Then ħ²/I=1.112e-68 /1.204e-46≈ 9.24e-23 J

So p=9.24e-23 / 3e8≈3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

Thus, the precise calculation gives about 3.08e-31 kg m/s.

So, sufficient to give the answer as approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s. However, there's a more precise way?

Alternatively, check through constants.

Given that 1 amu=1.66053906660e-27 kg. So exact values.

But in an exam setting, how precise is required? Probably 2 significant figures, so 3.08≈3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

Alternatively, the original given data has:

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, R=2 angstroms, w=4e14 rad/s.

So uncertainties. So R is 2 angstroms (one significant figure?), but in that case, perhaps the answer is to be given with 1 sig fig? Wait:

MX is 20 amu, MY=2 amu (each with possibly one sig fig, but 20 might be 2 sig figs). R=2 angstroms, one sig fig. w=4e14 rad/s, one sig fig. Thus, in a problem like this, likely the answer should have one significant figure. If doing the calculation as in:

From the initial quantities given with rough figures, you’d get values leading to the answer having 1 sig fig. So, 3e-31 kg·m/s

Wait, in the calculation, 9.24e-23 J is approximate because quantities are given with different sig figs. Let's think:

Mass X: 20 amu - if 20 is two sig figs. Mass Y: 2 amu - 1 sig fig. R: 2 angstroms -1 sig fig. Angular frequency: 4e14 rad/s -1 sig fig.

So according to sig fig rules, the least number is 1 sig fig for variables. But this might complicate. However, in engineering or physics problems, when values are given like "20 amu" sometimes considered accurate, but maybe it's best to stick with the data given.

Alternatively, just using all given numbers and keeping two sig figs for some. For example:
- If Mx is 20 (two sig figs) amu, My is 2 (one), R is 2 (one), w is 4e14 (one). But in that case, uncertainty would dominate in the terms with fewer sig figs. However, since the final answer's precision is influenced by the term with the least precision. Which in this case, ΔE_rot depends on μ, which includes (mass X, mass Y) & R. So mass Y is one sig fig; R is one sig fig. So μ would have 1 sig fig (from My=2 amu?), but actually:

μ = (20*2)/(20+2)=40/22≈1.8 amu, but converted to kg, 1.8*1.66e-27≈3.0e-27 kg. Holds one sig fig? If the original masses have 1 (My) and 2 (Mx might have two), this is ambiguous. But if they consider everything with 1 sig fig, answer is approx. 3e-31 kg·m/s.

Alternatively, given that in the problem data Mx is "20 amu," My is "2 amu," which could be written as 2e1 and 2e0. If such a case, perhaps the multiplication leads to 1 s.f. for My. So using conservative approach, since My is 2 amu (1 sig fig) and R is 2 Å (1 s.f.), makes the calculations lead to 1 s.f. Answer should be 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But maybe the problem expects 3.1×10^-31 kg·m/s, i.e., two sig figs, if question allows. But originally the given angular frequency is 4e14 (1 s.f.), masses are two and one s.f., R is one s.f. So the most restrictive is one s.f. Energy and thus momentum would be given to one sig fig, so 3×10^-31 kg·m/s.

So how precise? The values compute to approximately 3.08e-31, but since inputs have Mi and R at 1 sig fig (maybe?), answer is approx to 3e-31.

But wait:

Re-examne problem statement:

The data provided:

Mx: 20 amu

My: 2 amu

R: 2 angstroms

w: 4e14 rad/s

Mx is 20: is that 2 significant figures? If it's given as "20" in whole numbers without a decimal, then in some contexts, trailing zero is ambiguous. In scientific writing, if it's exact integers, maybe considered to have 1 sig fig unless stated. It might be better to confirm whether in the problem's context, numbers have sig figs as written. Since this is an olympiad-style problem, perhaps intended to use exact values as given, the answer is expecting write the exact calculation. The data shows ω=4*10^14, which is one sig fig. But for methods in solving the problem, uncertainty would expand if students get too bogged down. The answer key might prefer using 3.1e-31. Based on the exact calculation we ran, which was 3.08e-31. Some sources use 3e-31. Let me cross-verify with exact calculation.

But since my calculation gave about 3.08e-31 kg·m/s. Rounding to 2 sig figs would yield 3.1e-31, rounding to one sig fig 3e-31.

But I can consult my previous steps. Wait, here:

Masses were given as 20 amu and 2 amu. If those are to be considered as exact values (e.g., 20.000... amu and 2.000... amu?), then they would imply μ=40/22 amu=1.818... which gives more significant figures. But within realistic terms, bond length is probably given as exact to the problem. Hence, assuming all of these values are exact for the problem (even if written without decimals), so resulting calculation should be to the precision permitted by the computation.

But in practice, the problem may likely expect us to rationalize the different terms and present the calculation appropriately.

Alternatively, if following my exact calculation, even if inputs have few sig figs, our steps have kept several decimal digits so the final answer is ~3.1e-31. Perhaps the system expects more precise answer, given that ħ and conversion factors can have several decimal places.

Wait, having done the precise calculation:

p = ħ²/(I c). Let me compute each term precise.

First:

Mx = 20 amu =20*(1.66053906660e-27 kg) =3.3210781332e-26 kg

My=2 amu=2*(1.66053906660e-27 kg)=3.3210781332e-27 kg

μ=(Mx*My)/(Mx + My)= (3.3210781332e-26 *3.3210781332e-27)/(3.3210781332e-26 +3.3210781332e-27).

First denominator:

3.3210781332e-26 +3.3210781332e-27 =3.3210781332e-26 +0.33210781332e-26=3.65318594652e-26 kg.

Numerator:

3.3210781332e-26 *3.3210781332e-27=(3.3210781332)^2 *1e-53. Let's compute exactly:

3.3210781332×3.3210781332.

Compute (3.3210781332)^2:

Approximating:

First, multiply 3.32 *3.32=11.0224

But precise calculation:

3.3210781332 *3.3210781332:

Breakdown:

               3.3210781332
             ×3.3210781332
             -----------------
Multiply step by step: maybe difficult here, but perhaps using calculator, this is approximately (approx) 11.0 (with more decimals). However precise value approximates to 11.0324 (exact value requires considering all terms, but let me use calculator result assuming . But in reality, here is the things: if I square 3.3210781332, it's as follows:

=3.3210781332^2

≈(3.321078)^2 =3.321078 *3.321078≈11.0 but precise computation.

Calculate 3.321078 *3.321078:

First, compute with more steps:

3*3=9,

3*0.321078=0.963234

0.321078*3=0.963234

0.321078*0.321078≈0.103089

Adding up:

(3 +0.321078)^2=3^2 + 2*3*0.321078 +0.321078^2 =9 +1.926468 +0.103089≈10.0221 +1.926468≈Wait, better to do (a +b)^2 with a=3, b=0.321078:

=> a² + 2ab + b²=9 +2*(3)(0.321078)+0.321078²=9+1.926468+0.10309≈11.02956. So I get approximately 11.02956. Assuming farther digits:

So, as accurate calculation leads likely 11.033 approximately. Anyway, we can suppose that around 11.03 (unit), so squared gives 11.03, times 1e-53 (due to (e-26)*(e-27)), so 11.03e-53 kg². Wait, not exactly, but rather, points scale again:

Wait, units:

Mx=3.321e-26 kg, My=3.321e-27 kg. So multiplying gives (3.321e-26)(3.321e-27)= 3.321²e-53. Which approximates to.

Compute (3.321)^2=11.03, so 11.03e-53 kg²?

Wait, (3.321)^2=11.03, so 3.321e-26 *3.321e-27= 11.03e-53. Then divide by denominator 3.65318594652e-26 kg.

Thus, μ=(11.03e-53 kg²)/(3.65318594652e-26 kg)= (11.03/3.65318594652)e-27 kg≈3.019e-27 kg. Which is accurate.

Thus, μ≈3.0185e-27 kg.

I=μR². R=2e-10 m. So R²=4e-20 m².

Thus, I=3.0185e-27 kg *4e-20 m²=1.2074e-46 kg·m².

Then, ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s, so ħ²= (1.0545718e-34)^2= (approx) 1.112e-68 J²s² Then, dividing by I: 1.112e-68 /1.2074e-46≈9.208e-23 J. Then, dividing by c=299792458 m/s≈3e8 m/s gives p≈9.208e-23 /3e8≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

So precise calculation gave approximately 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But given that the answer requires standard SI unit, which kg·m/s, the answer should be presented as approximately 3.1×10^-31 kg·m/s. Yes. However, wait.

But angular frequency w=4*10^14 rad/s is given, but in reality, that is red herring because the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait a second, wait. Wait, the energy of the rotation-vibration model is a combination of rotation and vibration. However, in the fundamental state, which typically refers to the vibrational ground state (v=0). However, the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy." If the question refers to which state, whether rotational or vibrational.

Given that the molecule is in its "fundamental state," generally, this can refer to the ground vibrational state (v=0) and likely also the ground rotational state (J=0). So from (v=0, J=0) to the next state – perhaps considering rotations are lower in energy than vibrations, when transitioning.

But perhaps combined: vibrating and rotating mode.

But in the quantum rotation-vibration model, a transition would involve changing either v or J.

However, typically, transitions in molecules involve changes in both rotation and vibration. Since vibrational transitions have an energy much higher than rotational. So when a photon is absorbed to change the vibrational state, it usually involves a simultaneous change in the rotational state. For example, in the infrared spectrum, vibrational transitions are accompanied by rotational transitions.

But the question says that it's modelled as a rotation-vibration model. So perhaps it's a combined vibration-rotation transition, meaning that the photon energy has to match the combination of vibrational and rotational energy change.

But the problem reads "the molecule is in its fundamental state." Then, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy."

Assuming "fundamental state" is (v=0, J=0), then the next lowest state can be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J= something). But depending on whether changing J or changing v gives a lower energy transition.

But previously computed: transition for rotation is ~9.2e-23 J, for vibration is ~4e-20 J, which is about 400 times larger. So the transition to J=1 is lower energy. Therefore, yes. Therefore, switching to (v=0, J=1) would be next lowest. Hence, the photon's momentum corresponds to the rotational transition, not the vibrational.

However, since vibrational energy levels are much higher, in molecules spectroscopic transitions typically involve both. Yet, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". If allowed to change J without changing v, then that transition is allowed. So according to selection rules:

For rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv=±1.

But vibration and rotation occur simultaneously. So during a vibrational transition (Δv=1), you can also have ΔJ=±1. Hence,if there is a pure rotational transition (Δv=0, ΔJ=+1), it requires microwave photons, while vibration-rotation transitions (Δv=1, ΔJ=±1) are in the infrared.

Given that pure rotational transitions are microwave, energy scale as we calculated ~1e-23 J, infrared ~1e-20 J.

But since the problem is within the theoretical model, it probably wants to abstract away all of that, implying the model allows pure rotational transitions. So the answer is rotational transition as calculated.

Alternatively, if it wants to account both rotational and vibrational transitions, but since vibrational transition energy is higher, the photon required would need to have the same frequency as the lower rotational transition. Thus, checking is needed to see if vibrational transitions overlap, but the question is getting the lowest possible energy next state.

Assuming in model ground state (everything lowest), so to get the lowest next energy, add the minimum possible, which is the rotational.

Hence proceed under the initial conclusion:p=3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

**Final Answer**
The momentum of the absorbed photon should be \boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg·m/s}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule (X-Y) to transition from its ground state to the next lowest energy state in the quantum rotation-vibration model, we analyze the energy differences between vibrational and rotational transitions.

### **Key Parameters**
- **Masses**:  
  - \( M_X = 20 \, \text{amu} = 3.321 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \)  
  - \( M_Y = 2 \, \text{amu} = 3.321 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### **Energy Differences**
1. **Vibrational Energy** (change \( \Delta v = +1 \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}) = 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Rotational Energy** (change \( \Delta J = +1 \)):  
   - **Reduced mass**:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \frac{(3.321 \times 10^{-26})(3.321 \times 10^{-27})}{3.321 \times 10^{-26} + 3.321 \times 10^{-27}} \approx 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - **Moment of inertia**:  
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.01 \times 10^{-27})(2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
   - **Energy difference**:  
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}(1)(1+1) = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.204 \times 10^{-46}} \cdot 2 \approx 1.85 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J}
     \]

### **Photon Momentum**
The **lowest-energy transition** corresponds to the **rotational excitation** (\( \Delta J = +1 \)).  
Photon momentum is given by \( p = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} \):  
\[
p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{1.85 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J}}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 6.17 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

---

**Final Answer**  
The absorbed photon must have a momentum of **\( \boxed{6.2 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}} \)**.

Then, ΔE from J=0 to J=1 is (ħ²/(2I))*(1*2) - 0 = ħ²/I.\n\nYes, so ΔE_rot=ħ² / I. Then, 1.054e-34^2 / 1.2076e-46 ~ (1.112e-68) / 1.2076e-46 = ~9.21e-23 J (matches earlier math done).\n\nThus, p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Hmm.\n\nBut since precision isn\'t emphasized here, maybe the answer can just be expressed as approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is combining vibration and rotation transitions. In the rotation-vibration (rovibrational) spectrum, transitions involve changing v and J by ±1 each, but typically in vibration you have Δv=±1 combined with ΔJ=±1. However, in pure rotational transitions (microwave) you get ΔJ=±1 with v staying same, and in pure vibrational (infrared) you have Δv=±1 and ΔJ=0 or ±1 (so P and R branches). But in the problem statement, it says "switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Since both vibrational and rotational transitions could occur, but transitions where both v and J change would require higher energy.\n\nBut the "fundamental state" is usually v=0 with some J, and the question could be looking for a transition to v=1, which is the next vibrational state. However, excitation can involve both vibration and rotation (v and J)). But if you only consider the lowest energy state increment, going from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1,) OR (v=1, J=0.) since both could be next possible states.\n\nHaving previously calculated their energy differences as ≈9.2e-23 J (rotational) and ≈4.2e-20 J (vibrational), shows that ΔE rotational << ΔE vibrational, meaning the photon for the rotational transition has lower energy (longer wavelength, lower frequency). But the question is about absorption from the fundamental state to the "next state with the lowest possible energy." What\'s the next lowest energy state? For lower energy, transitions would be possible.\n\nBut wait, since the molecule is in its fundamental state (ground state), "next state with lowest possible energy" would be the lowest energy state above the ground state. If the ground state is (v=0, J=0), then the next states would be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0).\n\nComparing their respective energy differences: Which is larger? The vibrational one. Therefore, the rotational state (v=0, J=1) is a lower energy transition. Hence, the molecule can transition to (v=0, J=1) with lower energy. Hence, the required photon has momentum p = ΔE_rot/c.\n\nTherefore, the answer computed as 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I\'m missing a combination of state transitions, but in rovibrational transitions, the selection rules are Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1. If the molecule is initially in (v=0, J=0), then by absorbing a photon for vibrational transition (to v=1) along with rotational transition to J=1 or J= -1, but since J can\'t be negative, only J=1. So, the energy would be ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot. But since v increases by 1 and J increases by 1, so the total ΔE = (ħω) + ( ( (1^2 +1) -0)/ (2I) * ħ² ). But adding both terms would be a higher energy than the pure rotational or vibrational transitions.\n\nHowever, problem specifies switching “to the next state with the lowest possible energy”. Thus, from the (v=0,J=0) state, the next possible state with the lowest possible energy is either:\n\n- (v=0,J=1) [pure rotational excitation], requiring ΔE_rot ≈9.2e-23 J,\n\n- (v=1,J=0) [pure vibrational excitation], needing ΔE_vib≈4.2e-20 J,\n\nThe smaller of these is the rotational.\n\nTherefore, indeed the lowest energy transition is purely rotational, requiring a photon with momentum 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.\n\nHence, the required momentum is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe momentum of the absorbed photon should be approximately \\boxed{3.1 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg}\\cdot\\text{m/s}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743814308, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2171, prompt_tokens=1405, total_tokens=3576, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the momentum of a photon required for a diatomic molecule to transition from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state, we consider both rotational and vibrational energy transitions. 

1. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:
   - The energy difference for transitioning from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \times 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} = 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
     \]

2. **Rotational Energy Transition**:
   - The reduced mass \( \mu \) of the molecule:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The moment of inertia \( I \):
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
   - The energy difference for transitioning from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})^2}{1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2} \approx 9.24 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]

3. **Photon Momentum Calculation**:
   - The rotational energy transition requires less energy. The photon momentum \( p \) is given by \( p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} \):
     \[
     p = \frac{9.24 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}}{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 3.08 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}
     \]

Thus, the momentum of the absorbed photon should be approximately \(\boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}\cdot\text{m/s}}\).

 So in the fundamental state, we must clarify that 'fundamental state' often refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0), but how about the rotational state? Typically, at thermal equilibrium, there’s a distribution of rotational states. However, "fundamental state" here might imply the lowest vibrational (v=0) and lowest rotational (J=0). Thus, jumping from v=0, J=0 to either v=1, J=0 (vibrational) or v=0, J=1 (rotational). Since ΔE_rot is significantly smaller, that's the transition to consider.

Therefore, the required photon momentum is approximately 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But let me double-check the energy calculations for possible miscalculations.

Check μ: Mx = 20 amu; My = 2 amu

μ = 20*2 / (20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu, converted to kg. Wait, perhaps my earlier calculation was correct, but just for confirmation:

1. The reduced mass in amu: (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu → but in kg:

1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈3.019e-27 kg. Yep, same as before.

Moment of inertia I = μ R², R is 2 angstroms.

Wait, sometimes people use bond length as the equilibrium distance or radius. So radius is true for the moment of inertia.

Thus, μR² would indeed be 3.019e-27 kg*(2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that again:

3.019e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2076e-46 kg·m², matching previous value.

ΔE_rot for J=0 to J=1 is (1^2(1^2 + 1))/2I * ħ^2: though in rotational energy expression is: E_j = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1). Then, ΔE from J=0 to J=1 is (ħ²/(2I))*(1*2) - 0 = ħ²/I.

Yes, so ΔE_rot=ħ² / I. Then, 1.054e-34^2 / 1.2076e-46 ~ (1.112e-68) / 1.2076e-46 = ~9.21e-23 J (matches earlier math done).

Thus, p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Umm.

Expressed in significant figures, with given data:

Mx and My have two significant figures? If masses given with two (20 and 2), bond length (2), and omega (4e14). So everything 1 sig fig except perhaps omega which is just one, unless written as 4.0e14, but presented as 4*10^14, so maybe all start at one. Hmm.

But since precision isn't emphasized here, maybe the answer can just be expressed as approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but perhaps the question is combining vibration and rotation transitions. In the rotation-vibration (rovibrational) spectrum, transitions involve changing v and J by ±1 each, but typically in vibration you have Δv=±1 combined with ΔJ=±1. However, in pure rotational transitions (microwave) you get ΔJ=±1 with v staying same, and in pure vibrational (infrared) you have Δv=±1 and ΔJ=0 or ±1 (so P and R branches). But in the problem statement, it says "switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Since both vibrational and rotational transitions could occur, but transitions where both v and J change would require higher energy.

But the "fundamental state" is usually v=0 with some J, and the question could be looking for a transition to v=1, which is the next vibrational state. However, excitation can involve both vibration and rotation (v and J)). But if you only consider the lowest energy state increment, going from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1,) OR (v=1, J=0.) since both could be next possible states.

Having previously calculated their energy differences as ≈9.2e-23 J (rotational) and ≈4.2e-20 J (vibrational), shows that ΔE rotational << ΔE vibrational, meaning the photon for the rotational transition has lower energy (longer wavelength, lower frequency). But the question is about absorption from the fundamental state to the "next state with the lowest possible energy." What's the next lowest energy state? For lower energy, transitions would be possible.

But wait, since the molecule is in its fundamental state (ground state), "next state with lowest possible energy" would be the lowest energy state above the ground state. If the ground state is (v=0, J=0), then the next states would be either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0).

Comparing their respective energy differences: Which is larger? The vibrational one. Therefore, the rotational state (v=0, J=1) is a lower energy transition. Hence, the molecule can transition to (v=0, J=1) with lower energy. Hence, the required photon has momentum p = ΔE_rot/c.

Therefore, the answer computed as 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a combination of state transitions, but in rovibrational transitions, the selection rules are Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1. If the molecule is initially in (v=0, J=0), then by absorbing a photon for vibrational transition (to v=1) along with rotational transition to J=1 or J= -1, but since J can't be negative, only J=1. So, the energy would be ΔE_vib + ΔE_rot. But since v increases by 1 and J increases by 1, so the total ΔE = (ħω) + ( ( (1^2 +1) -0)/ (2I) * ħ² ). But adding both terms would be a higher energy than the pure rotational or vibrational transitions.

However, problem specifies switching “to the next state with the lowest possible energy”. Thus, from the (v=0,J=0) state, the next possible state with the lowest possible energy is either:

- (v=0,J=1) [pure rotational excitation], requiring ΔE_rot ≈9.2e-23 J,

- (v=1,J=0) [pure vibrational excitation], needing ΔE_vib≈4.2e-20 J,

The smaller of these is the rotational.

Therefore, indeed the lowest energy transition is purely rotational, requiring a photon with momentum 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

Hence, the required momentum is approximately 3.1e-31 kg·m/s.

**Final Answer**
The momentum of the absorbed photon should be approximately \boxed{3.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}\cdot\text{m/s}}.
