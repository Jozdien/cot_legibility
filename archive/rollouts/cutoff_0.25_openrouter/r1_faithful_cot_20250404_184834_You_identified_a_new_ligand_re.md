# Original Question

You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?

The absence of green fluorescence (eGFP) in the offspring is most likely due to the **lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette** remaining intact, as Cre recombinase does not recognize lox2272 sites. Here's the key breakdown:

1. **Construct Design**:
   - The ligand (mCherry) and receptor (eGFP) are each flanked by distinct stop cassettes: loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor.
   - Cre recombinase specifically targets **loxP** sites, removing the stop codon upstream of mCherry and allowing its expression.
   - **lox2272** is a mutant variant not recognized by standard Cre, leaving its stop codon intact and preventing eGFP expression.

2. **In Vivo Experiment**:
   - In SOX10-Cre mice, Cre is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, enabling recombination of the loxP cassette (ligand/mCherry) but not the lox2272 cassette (receptor/eGFP).
   - While mCherry would be expressed in Cre-active cells, eGFP remains silent due to the uncleared lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

3. **Alternative Explanations Ruled Out**:
   - The IRES element and bicistronic mRNA structure function as intended, ensuring translation of the receptor ORF independently of Cre.
   - Western blot confirmation suggests ligand and receptor proteins are produced, but fluorescent proteins depend on Cre-mediated recombination.

**Conclusion**: The lack of green fluorescence results from Cre's inability to excise the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, leaving the receptor-eGFP fusion unexpressed.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about why the green fluorescence (eGFP) isn't showing up in the offspring when they use the SOX10-Cre mice. Let me start by recalling the setup of the construct and the experiment.

First, the bicistronic vector they made has the ligand ORF at the 5' end fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' with eGFP. The promoter for the ligand is CBA, and the receptor is under an IRES element. There are loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassettes between the ligand and mCherry and receptor and eGFP, respectively. 

So, the Cre-lox system is crucial here. Since they crossed their homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, the Cre should be expressed in cells where SOX10 is active. In the offspring, the Cre would mediate recombination at the lox sites, removing the stop codons. 

The problem is that there's no green signal. Let me think: mCherry would be expressed if the ligand's stop cassette is removed, and eGFP if the receptor's stop cassette is removed. The construct has different lox sites for each cassette: loxP for the ligand/mCherry and lox2272 for the receptor/eGFP. Cre recombinase typically acts on loxP sites. But the receptor's cassette uses lox2272. Wait, what's the difference between loxP and lox2272? Oh right, lox2272 is a mutant variant that is not recognized by Cre unless you have a Cre variant that can recognize it. Standard Cre only works on loxP. 

Therefore, in this setup, even though SOX10-Cre is present, which would activate the Cre, the stop cassette before eGFP in the receptor is flanked by lox2272. If the Cre doesn't recognize lox2272, the recombination doesn’t happen here, so the stop codon remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. However, the mCherry's stop is removed because its cassette uses loxP. But the question states that there's no green signal. 

Wait, but the problem states that both stop cassettes are using different lox sites: one loxP and the other lox2272. If SOX10-Cre is active and they’re using regular Cre, which targets loxP, then the ligand (mCherry) would have the stop removed and thus express mCherry. But the receptor’s eGFP has lox2272, which Cre cannot act on. Therefore, the eGFP would not be expressed. Therefore, the absence of green is because the receptor-eGFP is still under a stop cassette that isn't removed because Cre doesn’t act on lox2272. 

Alternatively, maybe the bicistronic construct uses an IRES after the ligand's ORF. The promoter (CBA) drives the ligand (with mCherry), and IRES drives the receptor (with eGFP). So, the construct is 5' CBA promoter -> ligandORF-loxP-stop-loxP-mCherry -> IRES -> receptorORF-lox2272-stop-lox2272-eGFP.

But wait, when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, they saw proteins on Western blot. The total protein signal proportional to actin. But when the plasmid is transfected, maybe the stop cassettes are still present unless Cre is there. But if the Cre is not present in the transfected cells (the Western blot was after plasmid transfection into primary astrocyte cultures, which probably don't have Cre), then the original setup would have the stop cassettes; thus, the mCherry and eGFP would not be expressed. So the Western blot would detect the ligand and receptor proteins, but not the fluorescent proteins? But why would antibodies against the overexpressed proteins (ligand and receptor) detect them—unless the stop cassette is removed even without Cre? Wait, no—if the constructs are made so that the fluorescent proteins are only expressed upon Cre-mediated recombination. Without Cre, the stop cassette is present, so the mCherry and eGFP aren't expressed, but the ligand and receptor ORFs would have their own proteins. Except maybe the stop codon is in between the ORF and the fluorescent protein. So for the ligand: ligand ORF is followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. So without Cre, the transcription would go through, but translation would stop at the stop codon before mCherry. Therefore, the ligand is expressed (since the ORF is before the stop), and mCherry isn't. Similarly, the receptor ORF is before the lox2272 stop, with eGFP after. So without Cre, the receptor is produced but eGFP isn't. Hence, in Western blot using antibodies against the proteins (ligand and receptor), they would be detected because their ORFs are upstream of the stop cassettes and would be expressed even without Cre. The mCherry and eGFP are only expressed if Cre removes the stops. 

When they inject the construct into mice, which is homozygous for the construct. Then crossing with SOX10-Cre (hemizygous) would induce Cre in cells where SOX10 is active (neural crest derivatives perhaps). However, because the eGFP is behind the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, which Cre doesn't act on, that cassette remains, so eGFP remains unexpressed. So the red (mCherry) would light up in Cre-expressing cells because the loxP is recombined, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the eGFP can't, because the lox2272 sites are not targeted by Cre.

Therefore, the absence of green signal is due to the receptor's stop cassette not being removed because Cre cannot recombine the lox2272 sites individually; they require a specific recombinase. However, in this case, the Cre is only targeting loxP. Therefore, the correct answer is that the lox2272 sites are not recognized by Cre, hence the stop cassette in front of eGFP remains, so no GFP is produced.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the bicistronic vector is structured such that only one part is expressed if recombination occurs? Wait, the construct has the ligand first with CBA promoter. Then IRES before the receptor. So without Cre, the ligand is transcribed, and due to the CBA promoter; the IRES allows translation of the receptor mRNA. But IRES is in the same mRNA, so bicistronic mRNA. But each ORF (ligand and receptor) is followed by their own stop cassettes? Wait, the Lox-stop-Lox is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So normally, the ligand ORF would be translated up to the stop codon, but upon Cre recombination (which removes the stop), mCherry is fused. Similarly, the receptor's eGFP is after lox2272 stops. Therefore, for both fluorescent proteins to be on, their respective stop codons must be removed by Cre.

But SOX10-Cre may only affect the loxP sites. Since the eGFP is controlled by lox2272, Cre doesn't act here—no removal. So in the offspring with Cre, mCherry would be expressed (ligand + mCherry), but eGFP would remain off because the lox2272 sites remain. Thus, they don't see green (eGFP). That's the most likely reason.

Another thing to check: do SOX10-Cre mice express Cre in the right cells? The question states that the construct is in a neural crest-derived tissue context. The SOX10-Cre should activate in neural crest cells, so the recombination should occur there. But the lack of GFP is because the GFP's stop isn't removed. So the answer is that the lox2272 cassette is not recombined by Cre, so the eGFP remains silenced. Other possibility is that IRES is not working, but the Western blot would potentially show if the receptor is expressed. They had antibodies against the proteins and detected them. But without Cre, if they check in vitro, they should have ligand and receptor but not fluorescent proteins. But in vivo, Cre would only affect the ligand's stop cassette. Hence, in the mice, SOX10-Cre would activate mCherry in expressing cells, but not GFP. But the question said no green signal, so that's why the answer is that the GFP's stop is not removed. So the correct answer would be because the lox2272 is not recognized by Cre, so the receptor remains with the stop cassette, no eGFP expression.

Let me think through this issue. I'm trying to understand why there's no green fluorescence (eGFP) appearing in the offspring when SOX10-Cre mice are used. I'll analyze the experimental design and genetic constructs involved.

The researchers created a bicistronic vector with specific components arranged in a particular order. At the 5' end, we have the ligand ORF connected to mCherry, while the receptor ORF is positioned at the 3' end linked to eGFP. The ligand is controlled by a CBA promoter, and the receptor is regulated by an IRES element. Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, whereas between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

The Cre-lox system plays an essential role in this experiment. The researchers crossed homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, which should express Cre in SOX10-active cells. In the resulting offspring, Cre should facilitate recombination at the lox sites, thereby eliminating the stop codons.

The issue is the absence of green fluorescence. For mCherry to be expressed, the ligand's stop cassette needs removal, and similarly, for eGFP expression, the receptor's stop cassette must be removed. The construct employs different lox sites for each cassette: loxP for ligand/mCherry and lox2272 for receptor/eGFP. Typically, Cre recombinase acts on loxP sites, but the receptor cassette uses lox2272 instead. Lox2272 is actually a mutated version that standard Cre cannot recognize - it requires a specialized Cre variant for recognition. Regular Cre only functions with loxP sites.

So in this scenario, even with SOX10-Cre present and active, the eGFP's preceding stop cassette (flanked by lox2272) remains intact because Cre cannot recognize lox2272. This prevents recombination, leaving the stop codon in place and blocking eGFP expression. Meanwhile, mCherry's stop is removed because its cassette uses loxP sites. However, the problem indicates there's no green signal.

But the problem mentions that both stop...

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let me attempt to address this issue. The question pertains to why the green fluorescence (eGFP) is absent in the offspring when using SOX10-Cre mice. To analyze this, I'll first revisit the construct setup and the experimental design.

Initially, the bicistronic vector they've developed includes the ligand ORF at the 5' end linked to mCherry and the receptor ORF at the 3' end with eGFP. The ligand is driven by a CBA promoter, while the receptor is controlled by an IRES element. Positioned between the ligand and mCherry as well as between the receptor and eGFP are loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassettes, respectively.

The Cre-lox system is essential in this context. By crossing homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, Cre should be expressed in cells where SOX10 is active. In the progeny, Cre would facilitate recombination at the lox sites, excising the stop codons.

The issue arises because there's no green fluorescence observed. Let me consider this: mCherry would be produced if the ligand's stop cassette is eliminated, and eGFP would be produced upon removal of the receptor's stop cassette. The construct features distinct lox sites for each cassette: loxP for ligand/mCherry and lox2272 for receptor/eGFP. Typically, Cre recombinase targets loxP sites. However, the receptor's cassette relies on lox2272. What's the distinction between loxP and lox2272? Ah, yes, lox2272 is a mutant variant not recognized by Cre unless a Cre variant can detect it. Standard Cre functions solely on loxP.

Thus, in this configuration, even though SOX10-Cre is present to activate Cre, the stop cassette ahead of eGFP in the receptor is bordered by lox2272. If Cre doesn't identify lox2272, recombination can't occur, leaving the stop codon intact, and inhibiting eGFP expression. However, the mCherry's stop cassette is removed since it utilizes loxP. Nevertheless, the query indicates an absence of green fluorescence.

But hold on, the dilemma is described as both stop...

 cassettes are present. When Cre is active, it would recombine only the loxP sites. So the ligand's mCherry would be expressed (stop removed), but receptor-eGFP's stop cassette is lox2272, so Cre doesn't affect it. Thus, the eGFP remains off. So that could be the answer. The Cre only acts on loxP, not lox2272, so receptor-eGFP remains silenced.

But let me check: The Western blot analysis was done after plasmid transfection into astrocyte cultures. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. Why is the Western blot mentioned? The question says that in the Western blot, total proteins give a signal proportional to actin. Maybe that indicates that if the construct is properly expressed, but since they see no GFP in the mice, could there be another issue?

But the initial part where they created the construct and tested in vitro—maybe the construct is functional when transfected, as the stop cassettes would be present unless the Cre is active. Wait, maybe in the transfected cells, they use some method to induce Cre? But the problem states that after plasmid transfection, they do Western blot, which shows signals proportional to actin. Maybe their antibodies confirmed that the ligand and receptor are expressed when the stop cassettes are removed.

But when they made the mice, since the construct is homozygous, and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which presumably express Cre in specific cells (neural crest-derived cells, as SOX10 is involved in neural crest). In the offspring, when Cre is active, it should remove the loxP-stop-loxP cassette (allowing mCherry to be expressed) but not the lox2272 one, meaning eGFP stays off.

However, do they observe red? If they didn't see green maybe but did see red? The question doesn't mention red. They only report no green. 

So the answer is that the lox2272 cassette requires a different recombinase, like Cre, but it can't recombine lox2272 because Cre only recognizes loxP. Therefore, the receptor-eGFP's stop cassette is not excised, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the green is not observed because lox2272 is incompatible with Cre. The reason is that the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre, hence the stop codon remains in place, preventing receptor-eGFP expression. Therefore, selecting that answer.

The absence of green fluorescence (eGFP) in the offspring is most likely due to the incompatibility between the **Cre recombinase** expressed by SOX10-Cre and the **lox2272** sites flanking the receptor's stop cassette. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Construct Design**:
   - The ligand (5') and mCherry fusion are regulated by a **loxP-stop-loxP** cassette.
   - The receptor (3') and eGFP fusion are regulated by a **lox2272-stop-lox2272** cassette.
   - **SOX10-Cre** drives Cre expression in neural crest-derived cells.

2. **Cre-lox Mechanism**:
   - **Cre recombinase specifically recognizes loxP sites**, not mutant variants like lox2272. 
   - In the offspring, Cre removes the **loxP-stop-loxP** cassette upstream of the ligand-mCherry fusion, enabling mCherry expression.
   - However, **Cre cannot act on lox2272**, leaving the **lox2272-stop-lox2272** cassette intact. This prevents excision of the stop codon upstream of the receptor-eGFP fusion, blocking eGFP expression.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The receptor-eGFP fails to fluoresce because the lox2272 cassette is not excised by wild-type Cre, leaving the stop codon in place. This mechanism ensures that only the ligand-mCherry (regulated by loxP) is expressed in SOX10-Cre-positive cells.

**Answer**:  
The lox2272 sites flanking the receptor's stop cassette are not recognized by Cre recombinase. Consequently, the stop codon remains, preventing receptor-eGFP expression.

 no green. The Ligand has mCherry with loxP-stop. Crossing with Cre deletes loxP-stops, initiating mCherry-ligand expression. Yet, Receptor's stop is enclosed by lox2272, which Cre would not target. So despite the presence of Cre, whether the receptor's stop is removed hinges on Cre recombining the 2272 sites. As natural Cre only works on loxP, they can't excise lox2272 stops. Hence the receptor stays unexpressed (since there's a stop codon before eGFP), but the ligand/mCherry could be active as their stop is removed.

Maybe the Western blot was to check construct expression before using in mice. But the subsequent mouse model's cross with Cre doesn’t yield GFP.

So the summary is that perhaps the Cre can't act on both loxP and lox2272. Hence, the receptor's eGFP remains under the control of the intact stop cassette. The desired EGFP would come from recombination at the lox2272 site. But if Cre can't act on 2272, it remains. Hence no GFP.

Therefore, the lack of GFP is because the receptor's stop cassette requires lox2272 recombination, and the SOX10-Cre expresses standard Cre, which doesn't affect lox2272. Therefore, the stop stays, receptor is not made, and GFP isn't expressed.

Therefore, the crux is the SOX10-Cre can't act on the lox2272, thus not excising the stop codon in front of Receptor-eGFP. Therefore, no GFP expression, because the stop isn't removed, so even if the Receptor ORF is under IRES, it's stopped. That's the likely reason.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the lox2272 sites are not recognized by Cre recombinase (since Cre targets loxP), so the stop cassette remains, and eGFP is not expressed.
