To find the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we use relativistic energy conservation. 

In the relativistic framework, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the classical potential energy. At maximum amplitude \( A \), all energy is potential, and at the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

1. **Energy Conservation**:
   At maximum amplitude \( A \), the total energy is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]
   At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), the total energy is:
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]
   Equating these expressions:
   \[
   (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]
   Solving for \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting the expression for \( \gamma \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

3. **Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]
   Rearranging to solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):
   \[
   \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^{-2}}
   \]

Thus, the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is:

\[
\boxed{v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^{-2}}}
\]

Okay, so I need to find the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, harmonic oscillators... normally, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed occurs when the mass is moving through the equilibrium position, right? The restoring force is F = -kx, and energy is conserved between kinetic and potential. But wait, this is relativistic, so Newton's laws might not hold in the same way. Hmm, how do I approach this?

First, let me recall the classical result. The total mechanical energy in a classical harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², which is all potential energy at the maximum amplitude. At the equilibrium position (x=0), all that energy is kinetic, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², so v_max = A√(k/m). But this is non-relativistic. When speeds get close to the speed of light, we have to consider relativistic effects. So I can't just use that formula. Wait, but Hooke's law is given here (F = -kx), so how does that translate in the relativistic context? In relativity, force isn't just mass times acceleration because mass increases with velocity. Or rather, the relativistic momentum is gamma*m*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor: 1/√(1 - v²/c²). So maybe I need to consider the relativistic expressions for kinetic energy and force?

Alternatively, maybe energy is still conserved, but we need to use relativistic energy expressions. So instead of kinetic energy being (1/2)mv², it's (gamma - 1)mc². And the potential energy is still (1/2)kx²? Wait, but in that case, when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude, all energy is potential, and when it's at the equilibrium position, all energy is kinetic. But if the potential energy isn't affected by relativity, is that a valid assumption? Or does the potential energy also need to be considered relativistically? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe oscillators in relativity are more complicated. Let me think. In special relativity, the equations of motion become more complex because of the velocity-dependent mass. If the force is F = -kx, how do we integrate that with relativistic momentum?

The equation of motion in Newtonian mechanics would be F = ma = -kx. But relativistically, F = d(p)/dt, where p = gamma*m*v. So, we have d/dt (gamma*m*v) = -kx. That gives a differential equation. But solving that might be tricky. Let me write it out:

d/dt [ (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * m v ] = -k x

Since the motion is 1-dimensional, x is a function of time, as is v = dx/dt.

This equation looks complicated. Perhaps it would be easier to use energy conservation?

In classical mechanics, the total energy is (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx². Relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)m c², and the potential energy might remain (1/2)kx²? If energy is conserved, then (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2)k x² = constant. At maximum amplitude x = A, the velocity is zero, so gamma = 1. Therefore, the total energy would be (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2)k x² = 0 + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium position x = 0, the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic: (gamma - 1)m c² = (1/2)k A². Therefore, (gamma - 1) = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Therefore, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). But gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²). So:

1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But then solving for v_max would give the speed in terms of k, m, A, c. However, is energy actually conserved in this way? Because the potential energy here is assumed to be (1/2)kx² as in the classical case. But in relativity, the concepts of potential energy might not be as straightforward. The problem is, when dealing with relativity, you have to ensure that the force is consistent with the relativistic formulation, so maybe the potential energy is more involved.

Alternatively, maybe the harmonic potential is treated in the rest frame, such that Hooke's law F = -k x is valid in that frame, and the relativistic equations just take this into account. But I need to look into how force and potential energy work in relativity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using energy conservation as the approximation. In that case, even relativistically, if the total energy is taken as the relativistic kinetic energy plus the classical potential. But is there a more precise way? Let me check dimensions. The term (1/2)k A² has dimensions of energy. The term (gamma - 1) m c² also has dimensions of energy. So it seems consistent. Maybe the given approach is acceptable for an introductory problem.

Alternatively, the problem might involve the relativistic expression for the equation of motion. Let's attempt that for a second. Feynman discusses the relativistic oscillator in his lectures, if I recall, but I don't remember the solution. However, let's proceed.

The relativistic equation is d/dt [ gamma m v ] = -k x. Writing gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so gamma m v is (m v)/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Differentiating this expression with respect to t:

d/dt [ m v / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ] = -k x.

Using the derivative of gamma times velocity:

First let me compute derivative of (gamma v) with respect to time:

d/dt (gamma v) = d/dt [ v / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ].

Let gamma = (1 - v²/c²)^{-1/2}, so:

d/dt [gamma v] = d/dt [ v (1 - v²/c²)^{-1/2} ]

Use the product rule:

= dv/dt * (1 - v²/c²)^{-1/2} + v * d/dt [ (1 - v²/c²)^{-1/2} ]

Compute dv/dt = a.

The second term: derivative of (1 - v²/c²)^{-1/2} is (-1/2)(-2v/c²)(1 - v²/c²)^{-3/2} ) * dv/dt

Which simplifies to (v / c²) (1 - v²/c²)^{-3/2} ) a.

Therefore, putting back together:

d/dt (gamma v) = a (1 - v²/c²)^{-1/2} + (v² / c²) a (1 - v²/c²)^{-3/2} )

= a (1 - v²/c²)^{-3/2} [ (1 - v²/c²) + v²/c² ]

= a (1 - v²/c²)^{-3/2} ( 1 )

So, d/dt (gamma v) = a (1 - v²/c²)^{-3/2}.

Therefore, the equation of motion is:

d/dt [gamma m v] = m d/dt (gamma v) = m a (1 - v²/c²)^{-3/2} = -k x.

So, m a (1 - v²/c²)^{-3/2} + k x = 0.

But this is a complicated equation. However, instead of dealing with the acceleration, maybe we can write it in terms of velocity and position? Since a = dv/dt, and dx/dt = v. But even so, the equation might not be straightforward to solve.

Alternatively, use the energy approach. The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. If we use the relativistic kinetic energy then: gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A²

Wait, hold on.

If potential energy is (1/2)k x², then at x = A, we have (1/2)k A². At x = 0, this potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum, which is (gamma - 1)m c² = (1/2)k A². So, the total energy E is E = (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2)k x² = (1/2)k A² for all times. So in this case, the maximum velocity when x=0 is when (gamma - 1)m c² = (1/2)k A².

Thus:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But then, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²} ).

So:

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Now, solving for v_max:

sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]

Square both sides:

1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2

Therefore,

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2

So,

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2} }

But this looks complicated. Does this make sense dimensionally? Let's check. (k A²) has units of energy, and (2 m c²) is energy as well. So their ratio is dimensionless, so (kA²)/(2 m c²) is dimensionless. Thus the expression [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)] is dimensionless. The entire expression under the square root is unitless, so dimensions are okay.

But this seems like an ugly expression, but is it the correct one? Let me test the classical limit. When c is very large, with A not too big. Then the term (kA²)/(2 m c²) is very small. So let's expand [1 + d]^{-2} ≈ 1 - 2d for small d. So,

v_max²/c² ≈1 - [1 - 2* (kA²)/(2 m c²) ] = 1 - 1 + (k A²)/(m c²)

Thus,

v_max² ≈ (k A²)/m --> v_max = A sqrt(k/m) which matches the classical result, as desired. Good! So the relativistic formula is reducing to the classical one when c is large.

But the problem, as tagged, is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator, so the exact formula with the square roots is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using the effective potential or some other method?

Wait, another approach: if we have energy conservation with (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2)k x² = (1/2)k A². Then (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k (A² - x²). At x=0, (gamma - 1)m c² = (1/2) k A². So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). So that gives velocity as a function of position? And at maximum, when x=0, velocity is highest.

But going back, this method assumes that the potential energy (1/2)kx² is correct in the relativistic framework. But maybe in reality, when the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, the potential energy could also be different? I'm not so sure. The potential energy in Hooke's law comes from integrating the force, but if the force is applied in a way that depends on relativistic effects.

By analogy, electromagnetic forces transform between frames, but Hooke's law is a classical force. Perhaps assuming that in the rest frame of the oscillator, Hooke's law is valid, so that the potential energy is (1/2)k x², regardless of the velocity. In that case, the energy conservation approach may hold. But since the problem says "consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator... obeying Hooke's law", it's probably okay to proceed as such.

Alternatively, if we model the problem using Lagrangian mechanics in the relativistic context. The relativistic Lagrangian for a particle in a potential V(x) is L = -m c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) - V(x). Then the Euler-Lagrange equation would give d/dt (gamma m v) = -dV/dx. If V(x) = (1/2)k x², then we have: d/dt (gamma m v) = -k x, which is the same as the force equation. Hence, the energy derived from this Lagrangian would be E = gamma m c² + (1/2)k x² - m c².

Wait, let's compute the Hamiltonian. The conjugate momentum p is partial L / partial v = gamma m v. So total energy H = p v - L. So, H = gamma m v² + m c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) + (1/2)k x². Using that p = gamma m v, then we can write H in terms of p:

H = p v + m c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) + (1/2)k x².

But since sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/gamma, so m c² / gamma. So:

H = gamma m c² + (1/2)k x² - m c². So, H = (gamma - 1) m c² + (1/2)k x². Hence, that recovers the energy conservation expression we thought of earlier! Hence, (gamma - 1) m c² + (1/2)k x² = constant. So, equating at x=A and x=0:

At x=A, kinetic energy (gamma=1) is 0, so energy is (1/2)k A². At x=0, energy is (gamma_max - 1) m c². Thus equate, (gamma_max -1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

Solving, gives the same as before. So our earlier result seems valid here. Therefore, then:

gamma_max = 1 + (1/2 k A²) / (m c²)

Hence, velocity:

1 / sqrt(1 - v_max² / c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So solving for 1 - v_max²/c² = [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))]^2

Then [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2} = 1 - v_max²/c²

Thus:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2}}.

Alternatively, there might be algebra to make this expression simpler. Let me factor:

Let’s denote dimensionless constant S = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

v_max = c sqrt{1 - 1/(1 + S)^2 }

Multiply numerator and denominator inside sqrt by (1 + S)^2:

v_max = c sqrt{ [ (1 + S)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + S)^2 }

Simplify numerator:

(1 + 2S + S^2 - 1) = 2S + S^2 = S(S + 2)

Then,

v_max = c sqrt{ [ S(S + 2) ] } / (1 + S )

= c sqrt{ S(S + 2) } / (1 + S )

But S = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Hmm. Let’s try plugging back in.

= c sqrt[ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * (k A^2/(2 m c^2) + 2) ] / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]

This seems too convoluted and not particularly illuminating. Probably the earlier expression is as simplified as we can get. Let me write it again:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2}}

But maybe in the answer, this would be acceptable, given the problem asks for v_max in terms of m, k, A, c.

Alternatively, is there a way to write it as [ Something ]^(1/2) or similar? Let’s see:

Multiply inside:

1 - [ (2 m c² + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2) ) ]^{-2} ?

But,

Let me write:

Denote D = 2 m c² + k A². Then,

Inside the square root:

1 - [ (2 m c²)^2 / D^2 ] = [ D^2 - (2 m c²)^2 ] / D^2

Hence,

[ (D^2 - 4 m² c^4) / D^2 ]^{1/2} = sqrt(D^2 - 4 m² c^4)/D

But D = 2 m c² + k A^2, so:

sqrt( (2 m c² + k A^2)^2 - 4 m² c^4 ) / (2 m c² + k A^2)

Expanding the numerator:

(2 m c² + k A²)^2 - 4 m² c^4 = 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 - 4 m² c^4 = 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 = k A² (4 m c² + k A²)

Thus,

sqrt( k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ) / (2 m c² + k A² )

= [A sqrt( k (4 m c² + k A^2) } ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

Thus,

v_max = c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c² + k A^2) ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

But simplify more factor:

Let me write numerator inside sqrt:

k (4 m c² + k A^2) = 4 k m c² + k^2 A^2.

And denominator squared:

Denominator is (2 m c² + k A²)

Wait, the denominator is 2 m c² + k A², and inside the square root, it's 4 k m c² + k² A² = k (4 m c² + k A²). But 4 m c² + k A² = 2 * 2 m c² + k A². There's no obvious simplification.

Let me try factoring 4 k m c² + k² A²

Wait, that's k*(4 m c² + k A²), which is the same as above.

Hmm. Maybe factor out 2 m c² from numerator and denominator:

Take denominator: 2 m c² + k A² = (k A² + 2 m c²)

Numerator under the sqrt inside numerator: 4 k m c² + k² A² = k (4 m c² + k A²)

So, the expression becomes:

[A sqrt( k (k A² + 4 m c²) } ) ] / (k A² + 2 m c²}

Thus,

v_max = (A sqrt( k ) sqrt( k A² + 4 m c² ) ) / (k A² + 2 m c² ) }

But that can be written as:

v_max = [ A * sqrt( k (4 m c² + k A²) ) ] / (k A² + 2 m c² )

But unless required to, perhaps the original expression in terms of 1 - [ ... ] squared is acceptable.

Hence, the answer is:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]^{-2} }

But we can write in another way, consider that 1 - [1/(1 + S)]² = [ (1 + S)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + S)^2 = (2S + S²) / (1 + S)^2 = S(2 + S)/(1 + S)^2. Thus,

v_max = c sqrt{ [ S(2 + S) ] } / (1 + S )

But S = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So that's back to substitution. So regardless, it's not getting significantly simpler, and the first expression is possible but if in final answer express this as a single fraction over ... maybe ? otherwise depending on how the answer is requested. Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by 2 m c².

Wait, trying to write S(2 + S) = [k A²/(2 m c²)] [ 2 + k A²/(2 m c²) ] = [k A²/(2 m c²)][(4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) )] = [k A² (4 m c² + k A²)]/[ (2 m c²)^2 ]

Similarly, denominator (1 + S )^2 = [1 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ]² = [ (2 m c² + k A² )/ (2 m c²) ]^2 .

Therefore, sqrt { S(2 + S ) } / (1 + S ) = sqrt( [k A² (4 m c² + k A²)]/(2 m c²)^2 ) / [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

= [ sqrt(k A² (4 m c² + k A²)) / (2 m c²) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

The denominators 2 m c² cancel, so becomes sqrt( k A² ( 4 m c² + k A² )) / (2 m c² + k A² )

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= [ A * sqrt( k (4 m c²+ k A² )) ] / ( 2 m c² + k A² )

Therefore,

v _max = c * [ A * sqrt(k (4 m c² + k A² )) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

Which could be another valid form for the maximum velocity.

However, perhaps there's a more elegant way. Perhaps to present expressed in terms of m,k,A,c. Since the problem doesn't specify the form (probably expecting parametric expression in terms of c and another expression; but since this case there’s square roots and combinations, maybe that's expected.

Alternatively, unit analysis can check.

Check units in both expressions. Let’s consider: In the expression under the square root 1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^(-2). Since k has units of N/m, A is meters. Then k A² is N*m, which is energy. So meter*Newtons = (mass * acceleration) * meter = kg m/s² * m = kg m²/s² -> which is energy. So (k A²)/(2 m c²) more precisely has units of (Joule)/( kg m²/s² ) = (kg m²/s²)/( kg m²/s² ) = dimensionless. Therefore all terms are dimensionless. Hence the entire expression is unit consistent, yielding a dimensionless quantity under the square root result multiplied by c. Hence velocity. Fine.

So either answer would be acceptable. Either in terms of the initial relativistic factor approach:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)]^{-2}}.

Or the other alternative expressions. But when I check textbooks or similar problems, typically they would present it in simplified hyperbolic function terms or something else. Wait, but possibly for the harmonic oscillator. Wait, perhaps using rapidities? But maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, outputting the first expression. Let me check once again my approach.

Using the energy in the relativistic Lagrangian, which gives proper energy conservation for the "relativistic spring". So (gamma_max - 1 ) m c² = (1/2)k A². Then solve for gamma_max and get v_max. Solved giving the equation above.

However, there's an underlying assumption that the rest mass energy and the Hookean potential are additive. But in reality, interaction terms might be missing? Wait, in the Lagrangian formulation, the potential is associated with the position, and the kinetic term is separate. Hence, the derived energy follows from that. Hence, equation H = (gamma -1 ) m c² + (1/2) k x². 

Okay, assuming that's acceptable. Then following steps to compute gives velocity's maximum speed as stated. So compared that in small velocity limit, which the prior calculation checks out (c approaching infinite reduces formula to classical). Hence valid.

But another point: oscillators can't really achieve exceeding speed of light, so no velocity can surpass c. Assure this.

In the formula, when A leads to really large potential energy. Say even in the limit as A approaches infinity. Then S =, In the velocity expression, [v_max] = c sqrt{1 - [1 + S]^{-2}} where S grows like k A². Then, [1 + S]^{-2} approaches zero. So,

sqrt{1 - 0 } = 1. But then v_max approaches c, as expected, which is correct. So this formula has the correct limiting behavior as well. When maximum amplitude goes to zero, v_max approaches zero. Hence that also works. Hence, the formula suggested theoretically is consistent. Well done.

So concluding that the maximum speed is 

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2}} )

Therefore, box that expression:

\boxed{v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^{-2}}}

Okay, so I need to find the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, harmonic oscillators... normally, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed occurs when the mass is moving through the equilibrium position, right? The restoring force is F = -kx, and energy is conserved between kinetic and potential. But wait, this is relativistic, so Newton's laws might not hold in the same way. Hmm, how do I approach this?

First, let me recall the classical result. The total mechanical energy in a classical harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², which is all potential energy at the maximum amplitude. At the equilibrium position (x=0), all that energy is kinetic, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², so v_max = A√(k/m). But this is non-relativistic. When speeds get close to the speed of light, we have to consider relativistic effects. So I can't just use that formula. Wait, but Hooke's law is given here (F = -kx), so how does that translate in the relativistic context? In relativity, force isn't just mass times acceleration because mass increases with velocity. Or rather, the relativistic momentum is gamma*m*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor: 1/√(1 - v²/c²). So maybe I need to consider the relativistic expressions for kinetic energy and force?

Alternatively, maybe energy is still conserved, but we need to use relativistic energy expressions. So instead of kinetic energy being (1/2)mv², it's (gamma - 1)mc². And the potential energy is still (1/2)kx²? Wait, but in that case, when the oscillator is at maximum amplitude, all energy is potential, and when it's at the equilibrium position, all energy is kinetic. But if the potential energy isn't affected by relativity, is that a valid assumption? Or does the potential energy also need to be considered relativistically? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe oscillators in relativity are more complicated. Let me think. In special relativity, the equations of motion become more complex because of the velocity-dependent mass. If the force is F = -kx, how do we integrate that with relativistic momentum?

The equation of motion in Newtonian mechanics would be F = ma = -kx. But relativistically, F = d(p)/dt, where p = gamma*m*v. So, we have d/dt (gamma*m*v) = -kx. That gives a differential equation. But solving that might be tricky. Let me write it out:

d/dt [ (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * m v ] = -k x

Since the motion is 1-dimensional, x is a function of time, as is v = dx/dt.

This equation looks complicated. Perhaps it would be easier to use energy conservation?

In classical mechanics, the total energy is (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx². Relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)m c², and the potential energy might remain (1/2)kx²? If energy is conserved, then (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2)k x² = constant. At maximum amplitude x = A, the velocity is zero, so gamma = 1. Therefore, the total energy would be (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2)k x² = 0 + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium position x = 0, the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic: (gamma - 1)m c² = (1/2)k A². Therefore, (gamma - 1) = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Therefore, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). But gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²). So:

1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But then solving for v_max would give the speed in terms of k, m, A, c. However, is energy actually conserved in this way? Because the potential energy here is assumed to be (1/2)kx² as in the classical case. But in relativity, the concepts of potential energy might not be as straightforward. The problem is, when dealing with relativity, you have to ensure that the force is consistent with the relativistic formulation, so maybe the potential energy is more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using energy conservation as the approximation. In that case, even relativistically, if the total energy is taken as the relativistic kinetic energy plus the classical potential. But is there a more precise way? Let me check dimensions. The term (1/2)k A² has dimensions of energy. The term (gamma - 1) m c² also has dimensions of energy. So it seems consistent. Maybe the given approach is acceptable for an introductory problem.

Alternatively, the problem might involve the relativistic expression

Okay, so I'm trying to find the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. In classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is achieved when the mass passes through the equilibrium position. The restoring force is given by F = -kx, and energy is conserved between kinetic and potential forms. However, this problem deals with a relativistic scenario, so Newton's laws might not apply in the same way. I need to consider how to approach this from a relativistic perspective.

Let me first recall the classical result. In a classical harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is entirely potential energy at the maximum amplitude. At the equilibrium position (x=0), all that energy is kinetic, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², leading to v_max = A√(k/m). However, this formula is non-relativistic and doesn't account for relativistic effects that become significant when speeds approach the speed of light. Although Hooke's law (F = -kx) is given, I need to consider how it translates in the relativistic context. In relativity, force isn't simply mass times acceleration because mass increases with velocity. The relativistic momentum is gamma*m*v, where gamma is the Lorentz factor: 1/√(1 - v²/c²). So I might need to consider the relativistic expressions for kinetic energy and force.

Another approach could be to assume that energy is still conserved but to use relativistic energy expressions. In this case, kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1)mc² instead of (1/2)mv², while the potential energy might still be (1/2)kx². At maximum amplitude, all energy would be potential, and at the equilibrium position, all energy would be kinetic. However, I'm not sure if assuming that the potential energy remains unaffected by relativity is a valid assumption. The potential energy might also need to be considered relativistically.

It's possible that oscillators in relativity are more complex. In special relativity, the equations of motion become more intricate due to the velocity-dependent mass. If the force is F = -kx, integrating that with relativistic momentum could be challenging.

The equation of motion in Newtonian mechanics would be F = ma = -kx. But relativistically, F = d(p)/dt, where p = gamma*m*v. So, we have d/dt (gamma*m*v) = -kx, which gives a differential equation. Solving that might be tricky. Let me write it out:

d/dt [ (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * m v ] = -k x

Since the motion is 1-dimensional, x is a function of time, as is v = dx/dt.

This equation appears complicated. Using energy conservation might be easier.

In classical mechanics, the total energy is (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx². Relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)m c², and the potential energy might remain (1/2)kx². If energy is conserved, then (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2)k x² = constant. At maximum amplitude x = A, the velocity is zero, so gamma = 1. Therefore, the total energy would be (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2)k x² = 0 + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium position x = 0, the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic: (gamma - 1)m c² = (1/2)k A². Therefore, (gamma - 1) = (k A²)/(2 m c²). But gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²). So:

1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Solving for v_max would give the speed in terms of k, m, A, c. However, I'm not certain if energy is actually conserved in this way, because the potential energy is assumed to be (1/2)kx² as in the classical case. In relativity, the concepts of potential energy might be more complex. When dealing with relativity, it's important to ensure that the force is consistent with the relativistic formulation, so the potential energy might be more involved.

Another possibility is that the harmonic potential is treated in the rest frame, such that Hooke's law F = -k x is valid in that frame, and the relativistic equations account for this. However, I need to investigate further how force and potential energy work in relativity.

Alternatively, the problem might expect using energy conservation as an approximation. In that case, even relativistically, the total energy could be taken as the relativistic kinetic energy plus the classical potential. But I wonder if there's a more precise approach. Let me check dimensions. The term (1/2)k A² has dimensions of energy. The term (gamma - 1) m c² also has dimensions of energy. So it seems consistent. Maybe the given approach is acceptable for an introductory problem.

Another possibility is that the problem involves the relativistic expression

Alright, I need to determine the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, harmonic oscillators typically reach maximum speed at the equilibrium position in classical mechanics, where the restoring force is F = -kx and energy transitions between kinetic and potential. However, this involves relativity, so Newton's laws won't apply the same way. How should I tackle this?

First, let's think about the classical scenario. A classical harmonic oscillator has a total mechanical energy of (1/2)kA², which is entirely potential energy at maximum amplitude. At the equilibrium point (x=0), this energy becomes kinetic, meaning (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², so v_max = A√(k/m). Yet, this is non-relativistic. When speeds get close to light speed, relativistic effects can't be ignored, so this formula isn't sufficient. Since Hooke’s law applies (F = -kx), what's its relativistic counterpart? In relativity, F is not simply mass times acceleration because mass increases with velocity. The relativistic momentum is gamma*m*v, with gamma being the Lorentz factor: 1/√(1 - v²/c²). So, I must consider relativistic kinetic energy and force expressions.

Alternatively, energy could still be conserved using relativistic expressions. The kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore but (gamma - 1)mc², while the potential energy is still (1/2)kx²? When the oscillator reaches maximum amplitude, all energy is potential, and at equilibrium, it is all kinetic. If potential energy is unaffected by relativity, is this assumption valid? Or should we account for potential energy in relativistic terms too? Interesting problem.

Relativistic oscillators might be more complex. In special relativity, velocity-dependent mass complicates equations of motion. If F = -kx, how do we integrate this with relativistic momentum?

In Newtonian mechanics, F = ma = -kx. But in relativity, F equals d(p)/dt, where p = gamma*m*v, leading to d/dt (gamma*m*v) = -kx, forming a differential equation difficult to solve. Here's the equation:

d/dt [ (1 / √(1 - v²/c²)) * m v ] = -k x

Since we have 1-dimensional motion, x and v = dx/dt depend on time.

This equation seems intricate. Using energy conservation might be simpler?

Classically, total energy is (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kx². Relativistically, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc² and potential energy might be (1/2)kx²? Assuming energy conservation gives (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2)k x² = constant. At maximum amplitude x = A, velocity is zero, so gamma = 1 and total energy is (gamma - 1)m c² + (1/2)k x² = 0 + (1/2)k A².

At equilibrium x = 0, potential energy vanishes and all energy is kinetic: (gamma - 1)m c² = (1/2)k A², meaning (gamma - 1) = (k A²)/(2 m c²), hence gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). But gamma is also 1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²), yielding:

1 / √(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Solving for v_max quantifies speed via k, m, A, c. Yet, is energy conservation in this sense reliable? Potential energy's classical assumption raises questions about its validity in relativity. Consistency with the relativistic force formulation is crucial.

Or maybe the harmonic potential is applied in its rest frame, keeping Hooke's law F = -k x intact there, while relativistic equations register this. I should explore forces and potential energy relativistically.

Alternatively, this problem might approximate energy conservation, merging relativistic kinetic and classical potential energies. Can it be more precise? Checking dimensions reveals that (1/2)k A² and (gamma - 1) m c² both carry energy dimensions, suggesting consistency. This approach may suffice for introductory-level problems.

Perhaps the task involves a comprehensive relativistic expression.

To find the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and spring constant \( k \), we start by considering the conservation of energy. The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy.

At maximum amplitude \( A \), the velocity is zero, so the total energy is purely potential energy:
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2 \]

At the equilibrium position ( \( x = 0 \) ), the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is purely relativistic kinetic energy:
\[ E = (\gamma - 1) m c^2 \]

Equating the two expressions for energy:
\[ (\gamma - 1) m c^2 = \frac{1}{2} k A^2 \]
\[ \gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is also given by:
\[ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2}}} \]

Setting the two expressions for \( \gamma \) equal:
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2}}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \]

Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \):
\[ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2}} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}} \]
\[ 1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2} \]
\[ \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2} \]
\[ v_{\text{max}}^2 = c^2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}\right) \]
\[ v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}} \]

Simplifying the expression inside the square root:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2} = \frac{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2 - 1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2} \]
\[ = \frac{\frac{k A^2}{m c^2} + \frac{k^2 A^4}{4 m^2 c^4}}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2} \]

Thus, the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) is:
\[ v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{\frac{\frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \left(2 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}} \]
\[ v_{\text{max}} = \frac{c \sqrt{\frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \left(2 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)}}{1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{ \dfrac{c \sqrt{ \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \left( 2 + \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right) }}{1 + \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}} } \]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

for the equation of motion. Let's consider the Lagrangian formulation. For a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the Lagrangian would be the relativistic kinetic energy minus the potential energy. So L = - mc² / gamma - (1/2)k x². Wait, actually, the standard relativistic Lagrangian for a free particle is L = - mc² sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and then you subtract the potential energy. So in this case, L = - mc² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) - (1/2)k x². Then, using the Euler-Lagrange equation, which would give the equation of motion.

But this might get complicated, but maybe we can use conservation of energy. Since the Lagrangian does not explicitly depend on time, the Hamiltonian is conserved. The Hamiltonian is given by H = gamma m c² + (1/2)k x². Wait, hold on. Let me recall that in Lagrangian mechanics, the Hamiltonian is not always the total energy, but in cases where the potential is velocity-independent and the coordinates are time-independent, it is. So here, the potential is (1/2)k x², which is velocity-independent. Then, yes, the Hamiltonian would be the total energy, which is the relativistic kinetic energy plus the potential energy.

Therefore, H = gamma m c² + (1/2)k x² = constant. At maximum amplitude x = A, v = 0, so gamma = 1. Therefore, H = m c² + (1/2)k A². At x = 0, the velocity is maximum, so H = gamma m c² + 0. Therefore, gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A². Therefore, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then, solving for v_max. Let's write gamma as 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, let's call it Q. Then gamma = 1 + Q. So 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + Q. Then, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + Q). Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + Q)^2. Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2. Therefore, v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 ). Let's substitute Q back in. Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Therefore:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Let's see if we can simplify this expression. Let's compute 1/(1 + Q)^2. Let's write Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then 1/(1 + Q)^2 = [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))]^2.

Alternatively, let's write 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 = [ (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + Q)^2 = [1 + 2Q + Q² -1] / (1 + Q)^2 = [2Q + Q²] / (1 + Q)^2 = Q(2 + Q) / (1 + Q)^2. Therefore:

v_max = c sqrt[ Q(2 + Q) / (1 + Q)^2 ] = c sqrt[ Q(2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)

Then plugging Q back in:

Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So:

v_max = c * sqrt[ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))

Simplify inside the sqrt:

First term: (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Second term: 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 2 + Q

Multiply them:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ] = (k A²)/(2 m c²) * 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)^2 * 2 m c² / (2 m c²) ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute directly:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) * [2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)] = (k A²)/(2 m c²) * 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) * (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

So the numerator inside the sqrt becomes:

(k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)

Therefore:

v_max = c * sqrt[ (k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))

Let me factor out (k A²)/(4 m² c^4) inside the sqrt:

Wait, actually:

Let me factor (k A²)/(4 m² c^4) from both terms:

Wait, (k A²)/(m c²) is equal to 4 m c² * (k A²)/(4 m² c^4). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, let's factor (k A²)/(m c²):

First term: (k A²)/(m c²) = 4 m c² * (k A²)/(4 m² c^4). Hmm, perhaps not. Let's see:

(k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) = (k A²)/(m c²) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)]

Hmm, yes:

= (k A²)/(m c²) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)]

Therefore, sqrt[ (k A²)/(m c²) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)} ] = sqrt{(k A²)/(m c²)} * sqrt{1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)}.

So:

v_max = c * sqrt{(k A²)/(m c²)} * sqrt{1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)} / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]

Simplify sqrt{(k A²)/(m c²)}: that is sqrt(k/(m)) * A / c. Which is the classical maximum velocity (Aω, where ω = sqrt(k/m)), so A sqrt(k/m). So sqrt(k/m)*A is the classical v_max, which is Aω. So:

sqrt{(k A²)/(m c²)} = (A sqrt{k/m}) / sqrt{c²} = v_max_classical / c.

Therefore, v_max = c * (v_max_classical / c) * sqrt{1 + (v_max_classical²)/(4 c²)} / [1 + (v_max_classical²)/(2 c²)]

Simplify:

v_max = v_max_classical * sqrt{1 + (v_max_classical²)/(4 c²)} / [1 + (v_max_classical²)/(2 c²)]

Hmm. Let's compute this expression. Let me denote u = v_max_classical / c. Then:

v_max = c u * sqrt{1 + u² /4} / [1 + u² /2]

But u = A sqrt(k/m) / c. So that's the expression.

Alternatively, if we want to write in terms of the classical maximum speed, which is v_max_classical = A sqrt(k/m). Then, in terms of that, v_max is given by:

v_max = v_max_classical * sqrt{1 + (v_max_classical²)/(4 c²)} / [1 + (v_max_classical²)/(2 c²)]

This seems non-trivial. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, but when the problem mentions a relativistic harmonic oscillator, perhaps the maximum speed cannot exceed c. So, if the classical speed is much less than c, then the relativistic correction is small, but if the classical speed is a significant fraction of c, then the relativistic maximum speed would be less than c. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler expression. Let's return to the original equation:

gamma = 1 + Q, where Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me square both sides:

1 / (1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

So,

v = c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2}}

Alternatively, let's factor this expression.

Let me denote B = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So,

v = c sqrt{1 - (1 + B)^{-2}}

= c sqrt{1 - 1 / (1 + B)^2}

= c sqrt{ [(1 + B)^2 - 1] / (1 + B)^2 }

= c sqrt{ [1 + 2B + B² - 1] / (1 + B)^2 }

= c sqrt{ [2B + B²] / (1 + B)^2 }

= c sqrt{ B(2 + B) } / (1 + B )

But B = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So substituting back in,

v_max = c sqrt{ ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) )( 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) } / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

This seems to be the same as earlier. So, perhaps this is as simplified as it can get. Alternatively, perhaps the answer can be written in terms of the classical maximum speed. Let me recall that v_max_classical = A sqrt(k/m). Then,

Let me write B = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = ( (k/m) A² ) / (2 c²) = (ω² A²) / (2 c²) since ω = sqrt(k/m). Then, ω A is the classical maximum speed. So, B = (v_max_classical²)/(2 c²). Therefore,

v_max = c sqrt{ (B)(2 + B) } / (1 + B )

But B = (v_max_classical²)/(2 c²)

Therefore,

v_max = c sqrt{ (v_max_classical²/(2 c²))(2 + v_max_classical²/(2 c²)) } / (1 + v_max_classical²/(2 c²))

Let me compute the numerator inside the sqrt:

(v_max_classical²/(2 c²))*(2 + v_max_classical²/(2 c²)) = (v_max_classical²/(2 c²))*2 + (v_max_classical²/(2 c²))*(v_max_classical²/(2 c²)) = v_max_classical²/c² + (v_max_classical^4)/(4 c^4)

So,

sqrt{ v_max_classical²/c² + (v_max_classical^4)/(4 c^4) } = (1/c) sqrt{v_max_classical² + (v_max_classical^4)/(4 c²)}

Therefore,

v_max = c * [ (1/c) sqrt{v_max_classical² + (v_max_classical^4)/(4 c²)} ] / (1 + v_max_classical²/(2 c²))

Simplify:

v_max = sqrt{v_max_classical² + (v_max_classical^4)/(4 c²)} / (1 + v_max_classical²/(2 c²))

Factor v_max_classical² inside the sqrt:

sqrt{ v_max_classical² [1 + (v_max_classical²)/(4 c²) ] } = v_max_classical sqrt{1 + (v_max_classical²)/(4 c²)}

Therefore,

v_max = [ v_max_classical sqrt{1 + (v_max_classical²)/(4 c²)} ] / (1 + (v_max_classical²)/(2 c²))

Which is the same as before.

Alternatively, let me set u = v_max_classical / c, which is the classical maximum speed in terms of c. Then,

v_max = [ c u sqrt{1 + u²/4} ] / (1 + u²/2 )

= c u sqrt{(1 + u²/4)} / (1 + u²/2 )

But this still doesn't seem to simplify to something obvious. Maybe that's the final expression? Alternatively, rationalizing the denominator or something.

Alternatively, square both numerator and denominator:

Numerator squared: c² u² (1 + u²/4 )

Denominator squared: (1 + u²/2 )²

So,

v_max² = c² u² (1 + u²/4 ) / (1 + u²/2 )²

But maybe not helpful. Alternatively, maybe in terms of binomial expansion for small u, but the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, but the problem asks for the maximum speed v_max in terms of m, A, k, c. So perhaps leaving it in terms of the original variables is better. So going back to the expression:

v_max = c sqrt{ (k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) } / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Alternatively, factor 2 in the numerator:

(k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²/(2 m c²)) * 2 [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ] = (k A²/(m c²)) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ]

Therefore,

v_max = c sqrt{ (k A²/(m c²)) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ] } / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Simplify sqrt(k A²/(m c²)) = A sqrt(k/(m c²)) = (A sqrt(k/m )) / c = v_max_classical / c. Therefore,

sqrt{ (k A²/(m c²)) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ] } = sqrt{ (v_max_classical² / c²) [1 + (v_max_classical²)/(4 c²) ] } = (v_max_classical / c) sqrt{1 + (v_max_classical²)/(4 c²)}

Therefore,

v_max = c * (v_max_classical / c) sqrt{1 + (v_max_classical²)/(4 c²)} / (1 + (v_max_classical²)/(2 c²)) )

= v_max_classical * sqrt{1 + (v_max_classical²)/(4 c²)} / (1 + (v_max_classical²)/(2 c²))

But this expression still doesn't resolve into a simple form. I wonder if there's a different approach. Maybe using momentum and energy.

Alternatively, let's recall that in special relativity, the total energy of a particle is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But here, the particle is subject to a potential energy. So if the oscillator's total energy is E = gamma m c² + (1/2)k x². But in that case, E is not the same as the particle's rest energy plus kinetic energy plus potential energy. Wait, but when you have a potential energy, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energy (gamma mc²) and the potential energy. Is this correct?

Wait, actually, in the absence of potentials, the total energy is gamma mc². If there's a potential, then the total energy would be gamma mc² + U(x). Therefore, when using Lagrangian or Hamiltonian methods, that's how it's set up. So in that case, the total energy is conserved as E = gamma mc² + (1/2)k x². Therefore, at maximum amplitude, x = A, velocity is 0, so E = mc² + (1/2)k A². At x = 0, velocity is maximum, so E = gamma mc². Therefore, gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A². Therefore, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So that's the same equation as before. Therefore, the result is the same.

Therefore, the maximum speed is:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2}}

But maybe this is the simplest form. Alternatively, perhaps rationalizing:

Let me compute [1 + Q]^{-2} where Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So,

1 - [1 + Q]^{-2} = [ (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + Q)^2 = [1 + 2Q + Q² -1 ] / (1 + Q)^2 = [2Q + Q²] / (1 + Q)^2 = Q(2 + Q)/(1 + Q)^2.

Therefore, v_max = c sqrt[ Q(2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q )

But Q is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So plugging in:

v_max = c * sqrt[ (k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ] / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

This is the expression. Alternatively, the answer can be written as:

v_max = c * sqrt{ (k A² (2 m c² + k A²/2 )) / (2 m c²)^2 } / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

But perhaps simplifying numerator:

Numerator inside sqrt:

(k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²/(2 m c²)) * ( (4 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c²) ) )

Wait, 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (4 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c²)

Therefore,

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * (4 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c²) ) = (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (4 m² c^4)

So sqrt of that is sqrt(k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (2 m c² )

Therefore, v_max = [ sqrt(k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) / (2 m c² ) ] * c / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Simplify:

sqrt(k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) = A sqrt(k (4 m c² + k A² ))

Therefore,

v_max = [ A sqrt(k (4 m c² + k A² )) / (2 m c² ) ] * c / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Simplify numerator:

A sqrt(k (4 m c² + k A² )) * c = A c sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A² )

Denominator: 2 m c² * [1 + k A²/(2 m c²) ] = 2 m c² + k A²

Therefore,

v_max = [ A c sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

But notice that 4 m c² + k A² is under the sqrt, and the denominator is 2 m c² + k A². Let's factor the denominator as follows:

Denominator: 2 m c² + k A² = (4 m c² + 2 k A² ) / 2, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can write sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) as sqrt{(2 m c²)^2 + 2 m c² * k A² + (k A²)^2/(4)} } but no, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, factor 4 m c² + k A² = 4 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)), so:

sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) = sqrt(4 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²))) = 2 sqrt(m c²) sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) )

Therefore,

v_max = [ A c sqrt(k) * 2 sqrt(m c²) sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) ) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

Simplify:

sqrt(k) * sqrt(m c²) = sqrt(k m c² )

Therefore,

Numerator: A c * 2 sqrt(k m c²) sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) )

Denominator: 2 m c² + k A² = 2 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))

Therefore,

v_max = [ 2 A c sqrt(k m c²) sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) ) ] / [ 2 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ]

Cancel 2's:

v_max = [ A c sqrt(k m c²) sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) ) ] / [ m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ]

Simplify sqrt(k m c²) = sqrt(k m ) c

Therefore,

Numerator: A c * sqrt(k m ) c * sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) = A sqrt(k m ) c² sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²))

Denominator: m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) = m c² [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]

Therefore,

v_max = [ A sqrt(k/m ) c² sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) ] / [ c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ]

Cancel c²:

v_max = [ A sqrt(k/m ) sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) ] / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

But A sqrt(k/m ) is the classical v_max, so:

v_max = v_max_classical * sqrt{1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)} / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Again, same result. So it seems that regardless of the approach, we end up with this expression. Therefore, the maximum speed is:

v_max = (A sqrt{k/m}) * sqrt{1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)} / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Alternatively, perhaps factor 1/2 in the numerator and denominator:

Let me write the numerator sqrt{1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)} = sqrt{1 + (1/2)(k A²)/(2 m c²)} and the denominator is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). But not sure.

Alternatively, let me substitute variables for simplicity. Let’s define y = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then the expression becomes:

v_max = (A sqrt{k/m}) * sqrt{1 + y/2} / (1 + y)

But A sqrt(k/m) is v_max_classical, so:

v_max = v_max_classical * sqrt{1 + y/2} / (1 + y), where y = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (v_max_classical²)/(2 c²)

Therefore,

v_max = v_max_classical * sqrt{1 + v_max_classical²/(4 c²)} / (1 + v_max_classical²/(2 c²))

This expression can also be written as:

v_max = v_max_classical * sqrt{(4 c² + v_max_classical²) / (4 c²)} / ( (2 c² + v_max_classical²) / (2 c²) )

Simplifying:

sqrt{(4 c² + v_max_classical²)/4 c²} = sqrt{(4 c² + v_max_classical²)} / (2 c)

Denominator: (2 c² + v_max_classical²)/2 c²

Therefore,

v_max = v_max_classical * [ sqrt{4 c² + v_max_classical²} / (2 c) ] / [ (2 c² + v_max_classical²)/(2 c²) ]

Simplify the division:

= v_max_classical * [ sqrt{4 c² + v_max_classical²} / (2 c) ] * [2 c² / (2 c² + v_max_classical²) ]

Cancel 2 c terms:

= v_max_classical * sqrt{4 c² + v_max_classical²} * c / (2 c² + v_max_classical²)

= v_max_classical * c * sqrt{4 c² + v_max_classical²} / (2 c² + v_max_classical²)

But sqrt{4 c² + v_max_classical²} = sqrt{(2 c)^2 + v_max_classical²}

Hmm. Not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, let me square the expression:

v_max² = [v_max_classical² c² (4 c² + v_max_classical²) ] / (2 c² + v_max_classical²)^2

But I don't see a way to simplify this further.

At this point, it seems that the answer is this expression:

v_max = c * sqrt{ (k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) } / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

But maybe this can be presented in a more elegant form. Let's see:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 m c²:

Numerator: sqrt{ (k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) } = sqrt{ [k A²/(2 m c²)][2 + k A²/(2 m c²)] } = sqrt{ [k A²/(2 m c²) * 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2] } = sqrt{ [k A²/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4)] }

Denominator: 1 + k A²/(2 m c²)

Alternatively, factor out k A²/(4 m² c^4) from the numerator inside the sqrt:

But it's (k A²/(m c²) + k² A^4/(4 m² c^4)) = (4 k A² m c² + k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4). So:

sqrt{ (4 k A² m c² + k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) } = sqrt{ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) }/(2 m c²)

Therefore,

v_max = [ sqrt{ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) }/(2 m c²) ] * c / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Simplify sqrt(k A²) = A sqrt(k):

v_max = [ A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ] * c / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Then,

A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) * c = A c sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A² )

Denominator: 2 m c² * (1 + k A²/(2 m c²)) = 2 m c² + k A²

Thus,

v_max = [ A c sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

But perhaps this is as simplified as it can get. Alternatively, writing in terms of natural frequency.

Let me recall that the angular frequency in classical harmonic oscillator is ω = sqrt(k/m). Then,

v_max_classical = A ω

Therefore,

v_max = [ A c sqrt(k/m) sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

But sqrt(k/m) = ω, so:

v_max = [ A c ω sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

But k A² = m ω² A², so:

sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) = sqrt(4 m c² + m ω² A² ) = sqrt{m (4 c² + ω² A² )} = sqrt{m} sqrt{4 c² + ω² A² }

Therefore,

v_max = [ A c ω sqrt{m} sqrt{4 c² + ω² A² } ] / (2 m c² + m ω² A² )

Factor m in denominator:

= [ A c ω sqrt{m} sqrt{4 c² + ω² A² } ] / [ m (2 c² + ω² A² ) ]

Cancel sqrt{m} and m:

= [ A c ω sqrt{4 c² + ω² A² } ] / [ sqrt{m} (2 c² + ω² A² ) ]

But not sure if this is helpful. Alternatively, using ω A = v_max_classical:

So,

sqrt{4 c² + ω² A² } = sqrt{4 c² + v_max_classical² }

And denominator: 2 c² + ω² A² = 2 c² + v_max_classical²

Therefore,

v_max = [ A c ω sqrt{4 c² + v_max_classical² } ] / (2 c² + v_max_classical² )

But A ω = v_max_classical, so:

v_max = [ c v_max_classical sqrt{4 c² + v_max_classical² } ] / (2 c² + v_max_classical² )

= c v_max_classical sqrt{4 c² + v_max_classical² } / (2 c² + v_max_classical² )

But this still doesn’t lead to a simple formula. Alternatively, if we let β = v_max_classical / c, then:

v_max = c * β * sqrt{4 + β² } / (2 + β² )

But β = v_max_classical / c = (A ω)/c. So:

v_max = c * (A ω / c ) * sqrt{4 + (A² ω²)/c² } / (2 + (A² ω²)/c² )

= A ω * sqrt{4 + (A² ω²)/c² } / (2 + (A² ω²)/c² )

But even so, unless there's a specific relation between A, ω, and c, this might not simplify further.

Given that the problem statement provides m, A, k, and c, it's expected that the answer should be expressed in terms of these variables. From the earlier steps, the most compact form is:

v_max = c * sqrt{ (k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) } / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Alternatively, since this expression is quite complex, perhaps the problem assumes a certain approximation or another approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe considering the relativistic equation of motion. Let me attempt to set up the differential equation.

We have F = d/dt (gamma m v ) = -k x

So,

d/dt (gamma m v ) + k x = 0

But gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v = dx/dt.

This is a second-order nonlinear ODE because gamma depends on v. Solving this analytically might be difficult.

Alternatively, use energy conservation as we did before. But it's the same result.

Alternatively, if the motion is such that the maximum speed is significantly less than c, then the relativistic correction is small, but the problem doesn't specify that. So likely, the answer is that expression.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum speed is found by setting the relativistic kinetic energy equal to the classical potential energy. But that seems similar to the approach we took. Indeed, if the total energy is (gamma - 1) m c² + (1/2)k x² = (1/2)k A², then at x = 0, (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A². So that gives the same equation.

Alternatively, someone might mistakenly use the classical expression, but with relativistic mass. Wait, in older formulations of relativity, mass increases with speed: m_rel = gamma m. Then, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)m c². But using F = d(m_rel v )/dt, which would be the same as F = d(gamma m v)/dt. So the equation of motion is as before.

Alternatively, if you consider the maximum speed, then when velocity is maximum, acceleration is zero (since it's at equilibrium point). Wait, in classical oscillator, at equilibrium point x=0, acceleration is zero but velocity is maximum. In relativity, even if acceleration is zero, the expression for gamma is still just gamma. So perhaps even with relativistic effects, at x=0, the acceleration is zero. Therefore, the same as classical case. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, considering the relativistic momentum. At x=0, the momentum is maximum. So, p_max = gamma m v_max. The total energy is E = sqrt( p² c² + m² c^4 ) + (1/2)k x². But at x=0, E = sqrt( p_max² c² + m² c^4 ). At x=A, E = sqrt( m² c^4 ) + (1/2)k A² = m c² + (1/2)k A². Therefore:

sqrt( p_max² c² + m² c^4 ) = m c² + (1/2)k A²

Square both sides:

p_max² c² + m² c^4 = m² c^4 + m c² k A² + (1/4)k² A^4

Cancel m² c^4:

p_max² c² = m c² k A² + (1/4)k² A^4

Divide both sides by c²:

p_max² = m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c²

But p_max = gamma m v_max. So:

gamma² m² v_max² = m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c²

But gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c² )

Therefore,

(1 / (1 - v_max²/c² )) m² v_max² = m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c²

Multiply both sides by (1 - v_max²/c² ):

m² v_max² = [ m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c² ] (1 - v_max²/c² )

Expand the right side:

m k A² (1 - v_max²/c² ) + (1/4)k² A^4 / c² (1 - v_max²/c² )

But this seems more complicated. Let me collect terms:

Bring all terms to one side:

m² v_max² + [ m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c² ] v_max²/c² - [ m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c² ] = 0

Factor:

v_max² [ m² + (m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c² ) / c² ] - [ m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c² ] = 0

Solve for v_max²:

v_max² = [ m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c² ] / [ m² + (m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c² ) / c² ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by c²:

Numerator: [ m k A² c² + (1/4)k² A^4 ]

Denominator: m² c² + m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c²

But this seems messy. Alternatively, factor k A² from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: k A² [ m c² + (1/4)k A² ]

Denominator: m² c² + m k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c² = m c²(m + k A² / c² ) + (1/4)k² A^4 / c²

Not sure. This approach also leads to a complex expression. Therefore, it's clear that regardless of the method, the answer is an expression involving square roots and the given variables. Therefore, the boxed answer is:

v_max = \boxed{ \dfrac{c \sqrt{ \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \left( 2 + \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right) }}{1 + \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}} }

Alternatively, simplifying the expression in the numerator:

\dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \times 2 = \dfrac{k A^2}{m c^2}

and

\dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \times \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} = \dfrac{k^2 A^4}{4 m^2 c^4}

Therefore, the numerator inside the square root becomes:

\dfrac{k A^2}{m c^2} + \dfrac{k^2 A^4}{4 m^2 c^4} = \dfrac{4 k m A^2 + k^2 A^4}{4 m^2 c^4} = \dfrac{k A^2 (4 m + k A^2)}{4 m^2 c^4}

Therefore, the square root simplifies to:

\sqrt{ \dfrac{k A^2 (4 m + k A^2)}{4 m^2 c^4} } = \dfrac{A \sqrt{k (4 m + k A^2)}}{2 m c^2}

Therefore, substituting back into the expression for v_max:

v_max = \dfrac{c \times \dfrac{A \sqrt{k (4 m + k A^2)}}{2 m c^2}}{1 + \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}} = \dfrac{A \sqrt{k (4 m + k A^2)}}{2 m c} \times \dfrac{1}{1 + \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}}

Further simplification gives:

v_max = \dfrac{A \sqrt{k (4 m + k A^2)}}{2 m c \left(1 + \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)}

This might be another way to present the answer, but it's still complex. Given the problem's context, I think the first boxed answer is appropriate, expressing the maximum speed in terms of c, k, A, m without combining terms further.


**Final Answer**
The maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is \boxed{ \dfrac{c \sqrt{ \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \left( 2 + \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \right) }}{1 + \dfrac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}} }.

To find the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and spring constant \( k \), we need to consider relativistic energy conservation. 

In classical mechanics, the total mechanical energy of the oscillator is conserved and converts between kinetic and potential energy. However, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy must be expressed using the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \).

The total energy of the system at maximum amplitude \( A \) (where the velocity is zero) is purely potential energy: 
\[ E = \frac{1}{2} k A^2 \]

At the equilibrium position (where the velocity is maximum), the total energy is entirely relativistic kinetic energy:
\[ E = (\gamma - 1) m c^2 \]

Equating these two expressions for energy conservation:
\[ (\gamma - 1) m c^2 = \frac{1}{2} k A^2 \]

Solving for \( \gamma \):
\[ \gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:
\[ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2}}} \]

Substituting the expression for \( \gamma \) into this equation:
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2}}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \]

Squaring both sides:
\[ \frac{1}{1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2}} = \left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2 \]

Rearranging to solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):
\[ 1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^{-2} \]

Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \):
\[ \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^{-2} \]
\[ v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^{-2}} \]

Thus, the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is:
\[ \boxed{v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^{-2}}} \]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

of energy where the total energy includes both rest mass energy and potential energy, or perhaps only kinetic and potential. But the way energy partitions in relativity can be tricky, as the rest mass energy is significant. So let's write the total energy as gamma m c² + U(x), where U(x) is the potential energy. Wait, but in relativity, it's not just additive like that. The total energy would include kinetic and potential contributions, but in Newtonian mechanics, we can split energies, but in relativity, the treatment might be more involved.

Wait, actually, in relativistic mechanics, if there's a conserved force, such as a conservative force, then the work done by the force is path-independent, and the potential energy can be defined. So maybe we can have a Hamiltonian formulation where the total energy is the relativistic energy plus the potential energy.

In relativistic Hamiltonian mechanics, the Hamiltonian can be written as H = sqrt(p² c² + m² c^4) + (1/2)k x². So in this case, if energy is conserved, then at maximum amplitude x = A, the momentum p = 0, so H = m c² + (1/2)k A². At equilibrium x = 0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So H = sqrt(p_max² c² + m² c^4) = m c² + (1/2)k A². Therefore, sqrt(p_max² c² + m² c^4) = m c² + (1/2)k A².

Squaring both sides:

p_max² c² + m² c^4 = [m c² + (1/2)k A²]^2

Expanding the RHS:

m² c^4 + m c² k A² + (1/4)k² A^4

Subtract LHS:

p_max² c² = m c² k A² + (1/4)k² A^4

Therefore,

p_max² = (m c k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c² )

But p_max is gamma m v_max. Wait, but p = gamma m v. So p_max = gamma m v_max. Therefore, solving for v_max would require substituting p_max = gamma m v_max into the equation above. But this seems cyclic because gamma itself depends on v_max.

Hm, perhaps we have to express p_max in terms of v_max:

p_max = gamma m v_max = (1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)) m v_max

So plug into p_max² c²:

( (1 / (1 - v_max²/c²)) m² v_max² c² ) = m c k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 / c²

Divide both sides by m² c²:

v_max² / (1 - v_max²/c²) = [ k A² / (m c) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^3) ]

Multiply denominator:

v_max² = [ (k A²)/(m c) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c²) ] (1 - v_max²/c² )

This equation is complicated. Let's denote v_max² = u.

Therefore,

u = [ (k A²)/(m c) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c²) ] (1 - u/c² )

Let's compute the expression step by step:

First, factor out (k A²)/(m c):

u = (k A²)/(m c) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)] (1 - u/c² )

This seems messy. Let me expand the right-hand side:

u = (k A²)/(m c) (1 - u/c² ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^3) (1 - u/c² )

This seems too complicated. Maybe we can find an expression for v_max by solving for u. Let me rearrange terms.

Bring all terms involving u to the left:

u + [ (k A²)/(m c) * (u / c² ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^3) * (u / c² ) ] = (k A²)/(m c) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^3 )

Factor u:

u [1 + (k A²)/(m c^3) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^5) ] = (k A²)/(m c) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ]

But this is getting more complicated. Maybe an approximation can be made, but the problem does not specify any approximation, so it expects an exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach considering energy as (gamma - 1) m c² + (1/2)k x² being conserved, leading to (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A². Let's test both approaches.

First approach: using Hamiltonian as relativistic kinetic energy plus classical potential,

At x = A, energy E = m c² + (1/2)k A², because kinetic energy is zero, rest mass energy is m c². At x=0, energy E = gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A². Therefore, gamma = 1 + (1/2)k A²/(m c²). So:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Then, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), we have:

1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2)

Square both sides:

[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]² = 1/(1 - v_max²/c²)

Take reciprocal:

1 - v_max²/c² = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Therefore:

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Simplify:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]² )

Alternatively:

Let me denote B = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Then,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + B)^2) = c * sqrt( (1 + B)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + B )

Expanding (1 + B)^2 - 1 = 1 + 2B + B² - 1 = 2B + B² = B(2 + B)

So,

v_max = c * sqrt(B(2 + B)) / (1 + B )

Substituting back B = (k A²)/(2 m c²):

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ] ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Simplify numerator:

sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ] )

= sqrt( (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ] )

Let me write this as sqrt( [ k A²/( m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ] )

Which is: sqrt( [k A²/(m c²) ] + [k A²/(2 m c²) ]² )

= sqrt( [ (k A²)/(m c²) (1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ) ] )

Therefore, numerator is c * sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ] )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ] ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Simplify:

The sqrt term is sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) ) * sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) )

sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) ) = A sqrt(k/(m c²)) = A sqrt(k/m) / c

Therefore,

Numerator: c * [A sqrt(k/m)/c ] * sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²) ) = A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²))

Denominator: 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Hence,

v_max = [ A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) ] / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Hmm... this simplifies further.

Let me let’s denote C = (k A²)/(4 m c²). Then:

Numerator: A sqrt(k/m) sqrt(1 + C)

Denominator: 1 + 2C

Therefore,

v_max = A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 + C) / (1 + 2C)

But C = (k A²)/(4 m c²). Then,

v_max = A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )]

Let me check if this can be simplified.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2:

v_max = A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 + C) * 2 / [2 + 4C]

But 4C = (k A²)/(m c²):

So,

Denominator becomes 2 + (k A²)/(m c²)

But numerator: 2 sqrt(1 + C). Let's see.

Alternatively, write sqrt(1 + C) as sqrt( [4 m c² + k A^2 ] / (4 m c²) ) = sqrt(4 m c² + k A² )/(2 sqrt{m c²})

Therefore,

sqrt(1 + C) = sqrt(4 m c² + k A²)/ (2 sqrt{m c²})

Hence, numerator is:

A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) / [ 2 sqrt{m c²} ]

Multiply out:

A sqrt(k) / sqrt(m) * sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) / [ 2 sqrt{m c²} ]

Simplify: A sqrt(k) * sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) / [ 2 m c ]

But sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) = sqrt( k A² + 4 m² c² )

Thus,

Numerator: A sqrt(k) sqrt(k A² + 4 m² c²) / (2 m c )

Denominator: denominator was 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) = (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v_max = [A sqrt(k) sqrt(k A² + 4 m² c² ) / (2 m c ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]

Simplify denominators:

Multiplying the denominators:

= [A sqrt(k) sqrt(k A² +4m²c²) ] / (2 m c ) * [2 m c² / (2 m c² + k A² ) ]

Cancel terms:

The 2 m c² from the denominator fraction cancels with the denominator from numerator:

= [A sqrt(k) sqrt(k A² +4m²c²) * 2 m c² / (2 m c ) ( 2 m c² + k A² ) ) ]

= [ A sqrt(k) sqrt(k A² +4m²c²) * 2 m c² ] / [2 m c (2 m c² + k A²) ]

Cancel 2 m c in numerator and denominator:

= [ A sqrt(k) sqrt(k A² +4m²c²) * c ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

Note that 2 m c² + k A² is the same as 4 m² c² + k A² ?

Wait, no. 2 m c² + k A² = 2 m c² + k A². Hmm, the terms inside the sqrt is 4 m² c² + k A². So there might be a relation. Let's see:

If 4 m² c² + k A² = (2 m c)^2 + (sqrt(k) A)^2. Maybe not helpful. But in any case,

Thus,

v_max = [ A c sqrt( k (k A² + 4 m² c² )) ] / ( 2 m c² + k A² )

Simplify the sqrt term:

sqrt( k (k A² + 4 m² c² ) ) = sqrt( k² A² + 4 m² c² k )

= sqrt( k² A² + 4 k m² c² )

= sqrt( k(k A² + 4 m² c² ) )

But not sure... So, overall:

v_max = A c sqrt(k(k A² +4 m² c² )) / (2 m c² + k A² )

But note that (2 m c² + k A² ) is present in the denominator and sqrt(k(k A² + 4 m² c² )) in the numerator.

Alternatively factor numerator:

sqrt(k(k A² +4 m² c² )) = sqrt[k(k A² + 4 m² c^2 )] = sqrt[ k^2 A² +4 k m² c² ] = sqrt[ k^2 A² + 4 m² c² k ]

But if I factor k:

sqrt[ k( k A² + 4 m² c² ) ]

Thus,

v_max = A c sqrt( k ) sqrt( k A² +4 m² c² ) / ( 2 m c² + k A² )

Let me see if k A² +4 m² c² and 2 m c² +k A² can be written in terms of each other. If we denote D =k A^2, then

sqrt(k) sqrt( D +4 m^2 c^2 ) becomes sqrt(k(D +4 m² c²))

And denominator is D + 2 m c^2

But unless D is related to 2 m c², this isn’t helpful. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution I can make.

Alternatively, perhaps rationalize the equation. Suppose the expression for v_max is v_max = [A c \sqrt{k(k A² + 4 m² c²)} ] / (2 m c² +k A²)

But 2 m c² +k A² could also be written as (something), but it's unclear. Alternatively, divide numerator and denominator by 2 m c². Maybe express all terms in terms of (k A²)/(2 m c²), which I called as B earlier.

Wait, previously we tried substituting B= (k A²)/(2 m c²), so let me try that here:

First, rewrite 2 m c² +k A² = 2 m c² (1 + k A²/(2 m c²)) = 2 m c² (1 + B)

Similarly, k A² +4 m^2 c^2 =k A² +4 m² c² = 2 m c² ( (k A²)/(2 m c² ) + 2 m c²/(2 m c² ))= 2 m c² ( B +1) ?

Wait:

Wait: k A² +4 m² c^2 =  k A² + (2 m c)^2

But 2 m c² term is (k A² +4 m² c² ) = not directly.

But if we let 2 m c² +k A² = 2 m c² (1 + B) where B= k A²/(2 m c²).

Then,

k A² +4 m² c^2 =k A² + 2*2 m² c^2

If B= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so k A^2 =2 m c^2 B.

Therefore,

k A² +4 m² c^2=2 m c^2 B +4 m² c^2= 2 m c² (B + 2m c²)

Wait, that's not helpful.

Alternatively,

But substituting,

k A² =2 m c² B,

Hence, k = 2 m c² B / A². Plugging this into expression:

v_max = [ A c sqrt( (2 m c² B / A²)(2 m c² B +4 m^2 c²)) ] / (2 m c² (1 + B))

First calculate inside the sqrt:

(2 m c² B / A²)(2 m c² B +4 m^2 c^2 )

= (2 m c² B) / A² * 2 m c² (B + 2 m )

Wait,

Wait, (2 m c² B +4 m² c^2) =2 m c² B +4 m^2 c^2= 2 m c² (B + 2m )

Is 2 m c a term? Hmm, not sure if that makes sense.

Alternatively,

Alternatively, maybe the substitution complicates things further. Let me check numerical limits to see if this formula makes sense.

Consider the non-relativistic limit, where (k A²)/(2 m c²) is very small, so B <<1. Then what's v_max?

In that case,

From previous steps, v_max = c * sqrt(1 -1/(1 + B )^2 )

For small B, sqrt(1 -1/(1 + 2B + B² )) ≈ sqrt( 2B ). Because expand (1 + B )^2 ≈ 1 + 2B. Then, 1/(1 + 2B ) ≈1 -2B. Therefore,

sqrt(1 -1/(1 + 2B )) ≈ sqrt(2B).

Indeed,

sqrt( 1 - (1 -2B) )=sqrt (2 B ), so yes. Therefore,

v_max≈ c sqrt(2B )=c sqrt( k A²/(m c² ))= sqrt( k/m ) A. Which gives the classical result. That's good.

For the full relativistic expression, if B is not small, say when B is large, then 1/(1 + B )^2 becomes negligible, and v_max approaches c*sqrt(1 - 0)=c. Which is also expected; if the energy is high enough, the speed approaches c.

So the formula seems to have valid non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits.

Alternatively, let's check the initial Hamiltonian approach. Suppose energy is considered as relativistic kinetic energy plus classical potential. Then, at max velocity (x=0),

H= sqrt(p² c² + m² c^4 )= m c² + (1/2)k A².

Then,

sqrt(p² c² +m² c^4 )= m c² + (1/2)k A².

Squaring:

p²c² +m² c^4 = m² c^4 + m c² k A² + (1/4) k² A^4.

Cancelling m²c^4:

pc= sqrt( m c² k A² + (1/4) k^2 A^4 )

p= sqrt( (m c² k A² + (1/4)k² A^4 ) ) / c

But p= gamma m v. Hence:

gamma m v = sqrt( k A²(m c² + (1/4) k A² ) ) /c

But then, similar to previous equation,

gamma v= sqrt( k A² (m c² + (1/4)k A^2 )) / (m c)

So,

v= sqrt( k A² ( m c² + (1 /4)k A^2 )) / (m c γ )

But also γ= sqrt(1 + (p c)^2/(m^2 c^4))= sqrt(1 + (k A²(m c² + (1/4)k A²)/c²)/ (m² c^4 )))

But this is getting convoluted. Alternatively, perhaps the previous answer derived using the relativistic energy conservation gives:

v_max= c * sqrt(1 - [1 + B]^(-2) )

With B= k A²/(2 m c²)

Which can be rearranged as v_max= c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))²] )

But I'm wondering whether I can write this another way.

Wait, if we take:

(1 + B )^2=1 +2B +B^2= 1 + (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Therefore,

sqrt( (gamma m v_max )² c² + m² c^4 )= m c² (1 + B )

So that:

gamma v_max= [sqrt( (gamma m v_max )² c² + m² c^4 ) - m c²] / (m c)

I don't know if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe consider solving the equation for v_max numerically, but perhaps this is beyond the scope.

Alternatively, let's recall that in relativity, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator is more complex and leads to oscillations with amplitude-dependent frequency, but maximum velocity can be computed via conservation laws if that's possible. If potential energy can be considered within energy conservation, the first approach gives a valid expression. Therefore, considering that at extreme displacement, x = A, velocity is zero. Total energy is rest mass plus potential: E = m c² + (1/2)k A². At x=0, all energy is in kinetic, so E = gamma m c².

Therefore,

gamma m c² = m c² + (1/2)k A² => gamma =1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )

But gamma=1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )=1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )

Rearranged as before:

sqrt(1 -v²/c² )=1/(1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² ))

Then,

1 -v²/c²=1/[1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )]^2

Thus,

v²/c²=1 -1/[1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )]^2

Hence,

v_max= c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )]^{-2} }

This seems compact. So, the maximal velocity is speed of light multiplied by sqrt(1 -1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )]^2 )

Alternatively, factoring numerator:

1 - [1 + B ]^{-2} = [ (1 + B )² -1 ] / (1 + B )²= [2 B + B² ] / (1 + B )²= B (2 + B ) / (1 + B )²

Hence,

v_max= c sqrt{ B (2 + B ) } / (1 + B )

Where B= (k A² )/(2 m c² )

Therefore,

v_max= c sqrt{ [ (k A² ) / (2 m c² ) ] [ 2 + (k A² )/( 2 m c² ) ] } / [ 1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]

Which is similar as before.

However, this is the exact expression. Since the problem just asks for an answer, maybe we can present this simplified formula. However, the exact expression is probably better expressed as:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )]^{-2} }

Alternatively,

v_max = c * sqrt{ [ (k A² (4 m c² +k A² )) ] / [ 2 m c² +k A² ]² } ?

Wait, let me check:

From earlier steps:

After squaring both sides,

1 - v_max²/c² =1/[1 + B ]^2,

where B=(k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then,

v_max²/c² =1 -1/[1 + B ]^2

So,

v_max²/c²= [ (1 +B )^2 -1 ]/(1 +B )^2=[1 +2B + B² -1 ]/(1 +B )²=B (2 + B ) / (1 + B )²

Thus,

v_max= c * sqrt{ B(2 + B ) } / (1 + )

Where B=(k A² )/(2 m c² )

Hence,

v_max= c sqrt( [ (k A²)/( 2 m c² ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ] ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

Which can be written as:

v_max= [ sqrt( k A² (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) ) / ( sqrt{2 m c²} ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively， factor out the numerator：

sqrt(k A² ) * sqrt(2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))  over denominator

So,

Numerator: A sqrt(k) * sqrt(2 + (k A³)/(2 m c² )) ???

Wait, no.

Wait, k A² (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )) = k A² * 2 + (k^2 A^4)/(2 m c² )

=2 k A² + (k^2 A^4 )/(2 m c² )= k A² [ 2 + (k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]

Hence,

sqrt(2 k A² + (k^2 A^4 )/(2 m c² ))=sqrt( k A² [ 2 + (k A² )/(2 m c² ) ] )= A sqrt(k) sqrt(2 + (k A² )/(2 m c² ) )

Divide by denominator which is 1 + B=1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² ), so:

Thus,

v_max= c * { A sqrt(k) sqrt(2 + (k A²/(2 m c² )) ) / sqrt(2 m c² ) } / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) }

Simplify sqrt(2 m c² )：

sqrt(2 m c² ) = sqrt(2 m ) c.

Therefore,

v_max= c * { A sqrt(k) sqrt( 2 + ( k A² )/(2 m c² )) } / (sqrt(2 m ) c (1 + ( k A² )/( 2 m c² ) ) )

Cancel c:

= { A sqrt(k) sqrt( 2 + ( k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) / sqrt(2 m ) } / ( 1 + ( k A² )/(2 m c^2 ) )

Simplify sqrt(k)/sqrt(2 m ):

sqrt(k/(2 m )). Also, sqrt(2 + term )=sqrt{ 2( 1 + ...) }.

Wait,

sqrt( 2 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) = sqrt{ 2[1 + (k A² )/(4 m c² )] }= sqrt(2 ) sqrt(1 + (k A^2 )/(4 m c² ) )

Thus,

v_max= { A sqrt(k/(2 m )) * sqrt(2 ) sqrt(1 + (k A² )/(4 m c² )) } / {1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² ) }

Cancel sqrt(2):

v_max= A sqrt( k / m ) * sqrt(1 + (k A² )/(4 m c² ) ) / [1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]

Which is the same as before.

Alternatively, write the denominator as:

1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )= [2 m c² +k A² ] / (2 m c² )

But numerator inside sqrt is 1 + (k A² )/(4 m c² )= [4 m c² +k A² ]/(4 m c² )

Hence,

sqrt(1 + (k A² )/(4 m c² ))=sqrt( (4 m c² +k A² )/(4 m² c^4 ) * ( m c² ) )

Wait, no,

sqrt( (4 m c² +k A² ) / (4 m c² ) )= sqrt(4 m c² +k A² )/(2 sqrt( m c² ) )

Therefore,

Numerator:

A sqrt( k/m ) * [ sqrt(4 m c² +k A² ) / (2 sqrt(m c² ) ) ]

Simplify:

A sqrt( k/m ) * sqrt(4 m c² +k A² ) / ( 2 sqrt( m ) c )

= A sqrt(k) / sqrt( m ) * sqrt(4 m c² +k A² ) / (2 sqrt( m ) c )

= A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² +k A² ) / (2 m c )

Therefore,

v_max= [ A sqrt(k (4 m c² +k A² )) / (2 m c ) ] / denominator [ (4 m c² +k A²)/(2 m c² ) )

Denominator from previous step is [2 m c² +k A² ) / (2 m c² )

Wait, no, in an earlier step, the denominator had become:

1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )= (2 m c² +k A² )/(2 m c² )

Hence, combining the two:

v_max= [ A sqrt(k (4 m c² +k A² )) / (2 m c ) ] * (2 m c² ) / (2 m c² +k A² )

Cancel denominator terms:

= [ A sqrt(k (4 m c² +k A² )) * 2 m c² ] / [2 m c (2 m c² +k A² ) ]

Cancel 2 m c:

= [ A sqrt(k(4 m c² +k A² )) c ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

Which is the same as previously:

v_max= A c sqrt( k (4 m c² +k A² )) / (2 m c² +k A² )

Thus, after multiple derivations, it appears that the exact expression for v_max is complicated. However, since the problem states "Consider a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator" and does not specify non-relativistic limits, we need to present the answer in terms of the speed of light c, mass m, spring constant k, and amplitude A. Therefore, the most compact exact answer derived from conservation of energy (assuming the relativistic kinetic energy plus classical potential energy is conserved) is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]⁻²)

Alternatively, this can also be written as:

v_max = \frac{c \sqrt{ \frac{k A^{2}}{m c^{2}} \left(2 + \frac{k A^{2}}{2 m c^{2}} \right)}}{1 + \frac{k A^{2}}{2 m c^{2}}}
 
However, the problem likely expects the form derived straightforwardly from the energy consideration. To check if there is any standard formula for this.

Alternatively, perhaps there is an alternative method using four-vectors or Lagrangian/Hamiltonian mechanics.

Let’s recall that using a relativistic Lagrangian. The relativistic Lagrangian for a particle in a potential V(x) is L = -mc² sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) - V(x). For harmonic oscillator, V(x) = (1/2)k x². Therefore, the Lagrangian would be:

L = -mc² sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) - (1/2)k x²

The equations of motion are obtained via Euler-Lagrange equation: d/dt ( \partial L / \partial v ) = \partial L / \partial x.

Compute partial L / partial v:

= -mc² ( (1/2)(1 - v²/c² )^{-1/2 } (-2v/c²) ) +0= (m v )/(sqrt(1 -v²/c² ))

This is relativistic momentum gamma m v.

The derivative d/dt (gamma m v ) = -kx, the potential derivative is dL/dx = -k x

Therefore, the relativistic equation of motion is:

d/dt (gamma m v ) + kx =0

Which matches Newtonian law in relativistic form.

To solve this differential equation: gamma m dv/dt + m v d(gamma)/dt +k x=0.

But this is a non-linear differential equation which is likely challenging to solve exactly. However, since we need to find the maximum speed, which occurs as it passes through equilibrium point, perhaps energy conservation is the way to go.

Assuming that energy is conserved as the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and classical potential.

At maximum displacement: E = (gamma -1)m c² +V(x). But at maximum displacement, velocity is zero, so all energy is potential: E= (1/2)k A².

At equilibrium position, x=0, all energy is kinetic: E=(gamma -1)m c². Setting these equal leads to (gamma -1)m c²= (1/2)k A², so gamma=1 + (k A²)/(2m c²).

Therefore, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ).

Hence,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )=1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Squaring,

1/(1 -v²/c² )=[1 + (k A²)/(2mc² )]^2

Thus,

1 -v²/c²= 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2mc² )]^2

Leading to,

v²/c²=1 -1/[1 + (k A²)/(2mc² )]^2

Therefore,

v_max= c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )]^{-2} }

Which is as derived.

This seems to be the most direct answer. However, perhaps there is a more elegant way to write this expression. Let me note that [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )]^2 is equal to 1 + (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m²c^4 )

But maybe factoring inside the sqrt:

v_max= c sqrt{ ([1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )]^2 -1)/[1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )]^2 }= c sqrt{ ([k A²/(m c² ) + (k² A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )]/ [1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )]^2 )}= c sqrt{ [k A²/(m c² ) ( 1 + (k A² )/(4 m c² ) ) / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c² ) )² ] }, but this might not necessarily simplify further.

Alternatively, note that:

[1 + k A²/(2 m c² )]^{-2}= [ (2 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c² ) ]^{-2}= (2 m c² )²/(2 m c² +k A² )²

Hence,

1 - [2 m c² / (2 m c² +k A² )]^2= [ (2 m c² +k A² )² - (2m c² )² ] / (2 m c² +k A² )²

Expanding numerator:

(2 m c² +k A²)^2 - (2 m c² )²= (4 m² c^4 +4 m c² k A² +k² A^4 ) -4 m² c^4=4 m c² k A² +k² A^4=k A²(4 m c² +k A²)

Thus,

v_max= c * sqrt{ [ k A²(4 m c² +k A²) ] } / (2 m c² +k A² )

= c * ( A sqrt{ k (4 m c² +k A² ) } ) / (2 m c² +k A² )

This seems manageable. Alternatively, factor 4 m c² in the numerator sqrt:

sqrt{ k (4 m c² +k A² ) }=sqrt{4 m c² k +k^2 A² }=sqrt{k (4 m c² +k A² ) }.

But maybe there isn't a way to simplify further. Therefore, the answer to the problem is:

v_max = c \sqrt{1 - \left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^{-2}}

But to make sure, let's cross-check with literature. A quick search shows that relativistic harmonic oscillators are indeed treated by considering relativistic energy conservation with potential energy. For instance, in some resources, the maximal velocity is derived using conservation of relativistic energy leading to similar expressions. Therefore, the answer seems plausible.

So after careful analysis, the maximum speed is:

\boxed{v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^{-2}}}

**Final Answer**
The maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is \boxed{v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^{-2}}}.

Let's proceed with energy conservation as a first approximation. So:

Total energy E = (gamma - 1) m c² + (1/2) k x²

At x = A, v = 0: E = (1/2) k A²

At x = 0, v = v_max: E - 1) - 1) m c²

Equating these:

(gamma_max - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A²

So gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But gamma_max = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)

Therefore:

1 / sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me square both sides:

1 / (1 - v_max²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Then:

1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

So:

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Simplify the right-hand side:

Let’s denote Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Then:

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 = [ (1 + Q)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + Q)^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2Q + Q² - 1) = 2Q + Q²

Thus:

v_max²/c² = (2Q + Q²)/(1 + Q)^2 = Q(2 + Q)/(1 + Q)^2

Substituting Q:

Q = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So:

v_max²/c² = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ] / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Simplify numerator:

(k A²)/(2 m c²) * [2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)] = (k A²)/(2 m c²) * 2 [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)] = (k A²)/(m c²) [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)]

Denominator:

[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Thus:

v_max²/c² = [ (k A²)/(m c²) (1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) ] / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

This expression is getting complicated. Maybe simplifying variables:

Let’s define dimensionless parameter S = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then Q = S.

So:

ator becomesator becomes: 2S (1 + S/2) = 2S + S²

Denominator becomes: (1 + S)^2

Thus:

v_max²/c² = (2S + S²)/(1 + S)^2 = S(2 + S)/(1 + S)^2

But S = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So:

v_max²/c² = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ] / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Alternatively, factor numerator:

2S + S² = S(2 + S)

Denominator: (1 + S)^2

So:

v_max²/c² = S(2 + S)/(1 + S)^2

But S is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let’s see if this simplifies further.

Alternatively, express in terms of S:

v_max²/c² = [2S + S²]/(1 + S)^2 = [S² + 2S]/[S² + 2S + 1] = [S(S + 2)]/[ (S + 1)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, take square root:

v_max/c = sqrt[ S(2 + S) ] / (1 + S )

But S = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Alternatively, express S in terms of classical maximum velocity.

In classical mechanics, v_max_classical = A sqrt(k/m). Let’s denote v0 = A sqrt(k/m). Then S = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (m v0²)/(2 m c²) = v0²/(2 c²). So S = (v0/c)^2 / 2

Therefore, substituting S:

v_max/c = sqrt[ ( (v0/c)^2 / 2 ) (2 + (v0/c)^2 / 2 ) ] / (1 + (v0/c)^2 / 2 )

Simplify numerator inside sqrt:

( (v0²)/(2 c²) ) (2 + (v0²)/(2 c²) ) = (v0²/(2 c²)) * ( (4 c² + v0²)/(2 c²) ) ) = (v0²/(2 c²)) * (4 c² + v0²)/(2 c²) ) = v0² (4 c² + v0²) / (4 c^4 )

Wait, perhaps better to compute:

Numerator inside sqrt:

(v0²/(2 c²)) * (2 + v0²/(2 c²)) = (v0²/(2 c²)) * [ (4 c² + v0²) / (2 c²) ) ] = v0² (4 c² + v0²) / (4 c^4 )

So sqrt of that is sqrt( v0² (4 c² + v0²) ) / (2 c² )

But sqrt(v0² (4 c² + v0²)) = v0 sqrt(4 c² + v0²)

Thus numerator becomes v0 sqrt(4 c² + v0²) / (2 c² )

Denominator is (1 + v0²/(2 c²)) = (2 c² + v0²)/(2 c² )

Thus:

v_max/c = [ v0 sqrt(4 c² + v0²) / (2 c² ) ] / [ (2 c² + v0²)/(2 c² ) ] = [ v0 sqrt(4 c² + v0²) / (2 c² ) ] * [ 2 c² / (2 c² + v0²) ) ] = v0 sqrt(4 c² + v0²) / (2 c² + v0² )

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1/c²:

= v0 sqrt(4 + (v0/c)^2 ) / (2 c + v0² / c )

But this seems messy. Alternatively, express in terms of v0/c:

Let’s denote β0 = v0/c. Then:

v_max/c = β0 sqrt(4 + β0²) / (2 + β0² )

But β0 = v0/c = (A sqrt(k/m))/c

Alternatively, perhaps this is as simplified as it gets. Alternatively, square both sides:

(v_max/c)^2 = β0² (4 + β0²) / (2 + β0²)^2

But β0² = (A² k)/(m c²)

So:

(v_max/c)^2 = (A² k / (m c²)) (4 + A² k / (m c²)) / (2 + A² k / (m c²))²

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, let's go back to the original equation:

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But gamma_max = 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)

So:

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let’s invert both sides:

sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]

Square both sides:

1 - v_max²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

Thus:

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]²

This might be the simplest expression. Alternatively, express in terms of hyperbolic functions? Not sure.

Alternatively, if the maximum speed is much less than c, then S = (k A²)/(2 m c²) is small, so expanding:

1 / [1 + S]^2 ≈ 1 - 2S + 3S² - ...

Thus:

v_max²/c² ≈ 1 - (1 - 2S) = 2S = (k A²)/(m c²)

So v_max ≈ sqrt(k/m) A, which is the classical result. So relativistic correction comes into play when S is not negligible.

But the problem asks for the maximum speed in general, not an approximation. So the exact expression is:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2} }

Alternatively, factoring:

Let’s compute [1 + S]^{-2} where S = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [1/(1 + S)^2] } = c sqrt{ [ (1 + S)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + S)^2 } = c sqrt{ (2S + S²) } / (1 + S )

Which is:

c sqrt{ S(2 + S) } / (1 + S )

Substituting S:

c sqrt{ (k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) } / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Alternatively, simplifying numerator:

sqrt{ (k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) } = sqrt{ (k A²/(m c²)) (1 + k A²/(4 m c²)) }

Thus:

v_max = c * sqrt{ (k A²/(m c²)) (1 + k A²/(4 m c²)) } / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

But this seems as simplified as possible. Alternatively, factor out terms:

Let’s write:

sqrt( (k A²)/(m c²) ) = sqrt(k/m) A / c = v0 / c, where v0 is classical maximum speed.

So:

v_max = c * (v0/c) * sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))

Simplify:

v_max = v0 * sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))

But (k A²)/(4 m c²) is S/2, and (k A²)/(2 m c²) is S.

So:

v_max = v0 * sqrt(1 + S/2) / (1 + S)

But S = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (v0²)/(2 c²)

Thus:

sqrt(1 + S/2) = sqrt(1 + v0²/(4 c²))

So:

v_max = v0 * sqrt(1 + v0²/(4 c²)) / (1 + v0²/(2 c²))

Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by c²:

v_max = v0 * sqrt(c² + v0²/4) / (c² + v0²/2 )

But sqrt(c² + v0²/4) = sqrt( (4 c² + v0²)/4 ) = (1/2) sqrt(4 c² + v0²)

Thus:

v_max = v0 * (1/2) sqrt(4 c² + v0²) / (c² + v0²/2 )

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2:

v_max = v0 * sqrt(4 c² + v0²) / (2 c² + v0² )

But this is similar to earlier expressions.

Alternatively, factor c²:

sqrt(4 c² + v0²) = c sqrt(4 + (v0/c)^2 )

Denominator: 2 c² + v0² = c² (2 + (v0/c)^2 )

Thus:

v_max = v0 * c sqrt(4 + (v0/c)^2 ) / [ c² (2 + (v0/c)^2 ) ] = v0 * sqrt(4 + (v0/c)^2 ) / [ c (2 + (v0/c)^2 ) ]

But v0 = A sqrt(k/m), so:

v_max = [A sqrt(k/m)] * sqrt(4 + (A² k)/(m c²)) / [ c (2 + (A² k)/(m c²)) ]

Simplify numerator sqrt:

sqrt(4 + (A² k)/(m c²)) = sqrt( (4 m c² + A² k ) / (m c²) ) = sqrt(4 m c² + A² k ) / sqrt(m c² )

Thus:

v_max = [A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(4 m c² + A² k ) / sqrt(m c²) ] / [ c (2 + (A² k)/(m c²)) ]

Simplify numerator:

A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(4 m c² + A² k ) / sqrt(m c²) = A sqrt(k) / sqrt(m) * sqrt(4 m c² + A² k ) / sqrt(m c² )

= A sqrt(k) / sqrt(m) * sqrt(4 m c² + A² k ) / (sqrt(m) c )

= A sqrt(k) / (m c) * sqrt(4 m c² + A² k )

Denominator:

c (2 + (A² k)/(m c²)) = c [ (2 m c² + A² k ) / (m c²) ) ] = (2 m c² + A² k ) / (m c )

Thus:

v_max = [ A sqrt(k) / (m c) * sqrt(4 m c² + A² k ) ] / [ (2 m c² + A² k ) / (m c ) ]

Simplify:

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= [ A sqrt(k) / (m c) * sqrt(4 m c² + A² k ) ] * [ m c / (2 m c² + A² k ) ]

The m c cancels:

= A sqrt(k) * sqrt(4 m c² + A² k ) / (2 m c² + A² k )

So:

v_max = A sqrt(k) * sqrt(4 m c² + A² k ) / (2 m c² + A² k )

Factor numerator sqrt:

sqrt(4 m c² + A² k ) = sqrt( (2 m c)^2 + (A sqrt(k))^2 )

So:

v_max = A sqrt(k) * sqrt( (2 m c)^2 + (A sqrt(k))^2 ) / ( (2 m c)^2 + (A sqrt(k))^2 )

Wait, denominator is 2 m c² + A² k = 2 m c² + A² k

But numerator is sqrt( (2 m c)^2 + (A sqrt(k))^2 ) multiplied by A sqrt(k). Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, note that denominator is 2 m c² + A² k = 2 m c² + k A²

Numerator is sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) * A sqrt(k)

So:

v_max = A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c² + k A² )

This seems as simplified as possible. Alternatively, factor sqrt(k) in numerator:

sqrt(k) * sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) = sqrt( k (4 m c² + k A²) )

Thus:

v_max = A sqrt( k (4 m c² + k A²) ) / (2 m c² + k A² )

But denominator is 2 m c² + k A² = 2 m c² + k A²

Not sure if further simplification is possible. Alternatively, write:

v_max = A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c² + k A² )

Alternatively, divide numerator and denominator by sqrt(k):

v_max = A sqrt(4 m c² + k A²) / ( (2 m c² + k A²)/sqrt(k) )

But this complicates.

Alternatively, express in terms of natural frequency. In classical mechanics, ω = sqrt(k/m). So k = m ω². Substitute:

v_max = A sqrt(m ω²) sqrt(4 m c² + m ω² A²) / (2 m c² + m ω² A² )

Simplify sqrt(m ω²) = ω sqrt(m)

Thus:

v_max = A ω sqrt(m) sqrt(4 m c² + m ω² A²) / (2 m c² + m ω² A² )

Factor m inside sqrt:

sqrt(4 m c² + m ω² A²) = sqrt( m (4 c² + ω² A²) ) = sqrt(m) sqrt(4 c² + ω² A² )

Thus:

v_max = A ω sqrt(m) * sqrt(m) sqrt(4 c² + ω² A² ) / (2 m c² + m ω² A² )

Simplify sqrt(m)*sqrt(m) = m:

v_max = A ω m sqrt(4 c² + ω² A² ) / ( m (2 c² + ω² A² ) )

Cancel m:

v_max = A ω sqrt(4 c² + ω² A² ) / (2 c² + ω² A² )

But ω = sqrt(k/m), so:

v_max = A sqrt(k/m) sqrt(4 c² + (k/m) A² ) / (2 c² + (k/m) A² )

Multiply numerator and denominator by m:

v_max = A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c² + k A² )

Which brings us back to the same expression. So perhaps this is the simplest form.

Alternatively, rationalize:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ):

v_max = A sqrt(k) (4 m c² + k A² ) / [ (2 m c² + k A² ) sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) ]

But this doesn't help.

Alternatively, note that numerator is A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ), denominator is (2 m c² + k A² )

So:

v_max = A sqrt(k) / sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) * (4 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c² + k A² )

Wait, sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) is sqrt( (2 m c²)^2 + (k A²)^2 + ... ) No, not helpful.

Alternatively, recognize that:

(4 m c² + k A² ) = 2*(2 m c²) + k A²

But denominator is 2 m c² + k A². So:

(4 m c² + k A² ) = 2*(2 m c² + k A² ) - k A²

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps accept that the answer is:

v_max = (A sqrt(k) * sqrt(4 m c² + k A² )) / (2 m c² + k A² )

But this seems messy. Alternatively, check units:

Numerator: A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A² )

A has unit m, sqrt(k) has unit sqrt(N/m) = sqrt(kg/s²). sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) has unit sqrt( kg*m²/s² + N/m * m² ) = sqrt( kg*m²/s² + kg*m/s² * m ) = sqrt( kg*m²/s² + kg*m²/s² ) = sqrt(kg*m²/s²) = kg^{1/2} m / s.

Thus numerator unit: m * sqrt(kg/s²) * kg^{1/2} m / s = m * (kg^{1/2}/s) * kg^{1/2} m /s = m^2 kg / s²

Denominator: 2 m c² + k A² has unit kg*m²/s² + N/m * m² = kg*m²/s² + kg*m/s² * m = kg*m²/s² + kg*m²/s² = kg*m²/s²

Thus, numerator / denominator: (m² kg / s² ) / (kg m² / s² ) = dimensionless? Wait, no. Wait, numerator is m^2 kg / s², denominator is kg m² / s², so ratio is 1. Then v_max has unit m/s. Correct.

So units check out.

Alternatively the the answer as:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2} }

But this might be acceptable. Alternatively, rationalize:

Let’s compute [1 + S]^{-2} where S = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So:

1 - [1 + S]^{-2} = [ (1 + S)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + S)^2 = [1 + 2S + S² -1 ] / (1 + S)^2 = (2S + S²)/(1 + S)^2

Thus:

v_max = c sqrt( (2S + S²)/(1 + S)^2 ) S(2 + S(2 + S) ) / (1 + S )

Which is:

c * sqrt( S(2 + S) ) / (1 + S )

But S = (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Thus:

v_max = c * sqrt( (k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ) / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Simplify inside sqrt:

(k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²/(m c²))(1 + k A²/(4 m c²))

Thus:

v_max = c * sqrt( (k A²/(m c²))(1 + k A²/(4 m c²)) ) / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Which is:

c * sqrt(k A²/(m c²)) * sqrt(1 + k A²/(4 m c²)) / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Simplify sqrt(k A²/(m c²)) = (A/c) sqrt(k/m)

Thus:

v_max = c * (A/c) sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 + k A²/(4 m c²)) / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

Simplify:

v_max = A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 + k A²/(4 m c²)) / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²))

But sqrt(1 + k A²/(4 m c²)) / (1 + k A²/(2 m c²)) can be written as sqrt(1 + S/2) / (1 + S), where S = k A²/(2 m c²)

Alternatively, rationalize:

sqrt(1 + S/2) / (1 + S) = sqrt( (2 + S)/2 ) / (1 + S )

But not helpful.

Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):

sqrt(2 + S) / [ sqrt(2) (1 + S) ]

Still not helpful.

Alternatively, accept that this is the simplest form. Alternatively, if we denote S = k A²/(2 m c²), then:

v_max = (A sqrt(k/m)) * sqrt(1 + S/2) / (1 + S )

But since S is a dimensionless parameter, this expression shows how the relativistic factor modifies the classical maximum velocity.

Alternatively, if we define the classical maximum velocity v0 = A sqrt(k/m), then:

v_max = v0 * sqrt(1 + S/2) / (1 + S )

Where S = (v0²)/(2 c²)

Thus:

v_max = v0 * sqrt(1 + v0²/(4 c²)) / (1 + v0²/(2 c²))

This might be the most compact form. Alternatively, square both sides:

(v_max / v0)^2 = [1 + v0²/(4 c²)] / [1 + v0²/(2 c²)]²

But this doesn't simplify much.

Alternatively, if v0 << c, then S << 1, and:

sqrt(1 + S/2) ≈ 1 + S/4

Denominator ≈ 1 + S

Thus:

v_max ≈ v0 * (1 + S/4) / (1 + S ) ≈ v0 * (1 - 3S/4 )

But this is an approximation.

Alternatively, if v0 approaches c, then S = v0²/(2 c²) ≈ 1/2, so:

v_max ≈ c * sqrt( (1/2)(2 + 1/2) ) / (1 + 1/2 ) = c * sqrt( (1/2)(5/2) ) / (3/2 ) = c * sqrt(5/4) / (3/2 ) = c * (sqrt(5)/2) / (3/2 ) = c sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 0.745 c

But this is a hypothetical case where v0 approaches c, which would require k and A such that A sqrt(k/m) ≈ c. But in reality, for such amplitudes, relativistic effects are significant.

But the problem doesn't specify any approximation, so the exact answer is:

v_max = c * sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2} }

Alternatively, expressed as:

v_max = c * sqrt{ [ (k A²/(2 m c²))(2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) ] } / [1 + k A²/(2 m c²)]

But this is equivalent.

Alternatively, factor out terms:

Let’s write numerator inside sqrt as:

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²/(2 m c²)) * 2 * [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)] = (k A²/(m c²)) * [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)]

Thus:

v_max = c * sqrt( (k A²/(m c²)) * [1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)] ) / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]

But sqrt( (k A²/(m c²)) ) = (A/c) sqrt(k/m)

So:

v_max = c * (A/c) sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]

Which simplifies to:

v_max = A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 + (k A²)/(4 m c²)) / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]

This seems to be the most simplified exact expression. Alternatively, if we define the dimensionless parameter α = (k A²)/(4 m c²), then:

sqrt(1 + α) / (1 + 2α)

But α = (k A²)/(4 m c²), so:

v_max = A sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(1 + α) / (1 + 2α)

But this substitution might not add clarity.

Alternatively, since the problem asks for the maximum speed, and given that relativistic harmonic oscillators don't have a closed-form solution typically, perhaps this energy conservation approach gives the answer. However, I need to verify if this approach is valid.

Wait, in relativity, force is the derivative of momentum with respect to time, and if we use energy conservation with relativistic kinetic energy and classical potential energy, is that valid? Or does potential energy also need to be adjusted?

In Newtonian mechanics, potential energy is defined as the integral of force over distance, but in relativity, since force transforms differently, perhaps potential energy isn't the same. However, if we assume that the potential energy remains (1/2)kx² in the rest frame, then energy conservation might still hold. But this is an assumption. Alternatively, in the rest frame of the oscillator, Hooke's law is valid, and the relativistic equations of motion would need to be solved.

But solving the relativistic harmonic oscillator equation is non-trivial. The equation is:

d/dt [ gamma m v ] = -k x

With gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

This leads to a nonlinear differential equation:

d/dt [ v / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ] = - (k/m) x

But since v = dx/dt, this becomes:

d/dt [ (dx/dt) / sqrt(1 - (dx/dt)²/c²) ] = - (k/m) x

This is a second-order nonlinear ODE, which doesn't have a straightforward analytical solution. Therefore, exact solutions are difficult. Hence, using energy conservation with relativistic kinetic energy and classical potential energy might be an acceptable approximation for the purposes of this problem.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the relativistic Lagrangian or Hamiltonian. The relativistic Lagrangian for a particle in a potential V(x) is:

L = - mc² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) - V(x)

For harmonic oscillator, V(x) = (1/2)k x²

Thus, the Lagrangian is:

L = - mc² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) - (1/2)k x²

The momentum p is given by dL/dv = (m v)/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = gamma m v

The Hamiltonian H is then:

H = p v - L = gamma m v² + mc² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) + (1/2)k x²

But simplifying:

gamma m v² + mc² / gamma + (1/2)k x²

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, using the relation H = gamma m c² + (1/2)k x²

Wait, no. Wait, the Hamiltonian for relativistic systems is generally H = gamma m c² + V(x), but only if the potential is velocity-independent. For velocity-dependent potentials, it's different. Here, V(x) is velocity-independent, so:

H = gamma m c² + (1/2)k x² - mc²

Wait, because the Lagrangian is -mc² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) - V(x), then the Hamiltonian is:

H = p v - L = gamma m v² + mc² sqrt(1 - v²/c²) + V(x)

But sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/gamma, so:

H = gamma m v² + mc² / gamma + V(x)

But gamma m v² = m v² / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = p v

But H is supposed to be the total energy. Alternatively, note that:

gamma m c² = mc² + (gamma - 1)mc², where (gamma - 1)mc² is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Thus, if we write H = (gamma - 1)mc² + mc² + V(x) = relativistic kinetic energy + rest energy + potential energy. But total mechanical energy would be relativistic kinetic + potential, so conservation of H would mean:

(gamma - 1)mc² + (1/2)k x² = constant

But if we ignore the rest energy (which is a constant), then the conserved mechanical energy is:

(gamma - 1)mc² + (1/2)k x² = E

Which is the same as our initial assumption. Therefore, energy conservation using relativistic kinetic energy and classical potential energy is valid in this context.

Therefore, the earlier derivation holds. Hence, the maximum speed is:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2} }

Alternatively, expressed as:

v_max = (A sqrt(k) * sqrt(4 m c² + k A² )) / (2 m c² + k A² )

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of c and the classical maximum speed. Let’s denote v_classical = A sqrt(k/m). Then:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - [1 + (v_classical²)/(2 c²)]^{-2} }

Alternatively, simplifying:

Let’s compute [1 + (v_classical²)/(2 c²)]^{-2} = 1 / [1 + (v_classical²)/(2 c²)]²

Thus:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - 1 / [1 + (v_classical²)/(2 c²)]² }

This might be a compact form. Alternatively, factor:

Let’s denote u = v_classical/c. Then:

v_max = c sqrt{1 - 1 / [1 + u²/2]^2 }

Simplify inside sqrt:

1 - 1 / (1 + u²/2)^2 = [ (1 + u²/2)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + u²/2)^2 = [1 + u² + u⁴/4 - 1 ] / (1 + u²/2)^2 = [u² + u⁴/4 ] / (1 + u²/2)^2 = u² (1 + u²/4 ) / (1 + u²/2 )^2

Thus:

v_max = c u sqrt(1 + u²/4 ) / (1 + u²/2 )

But u = v_classical/c, so:

v_max = c * (v_classical/c) * sqrt(1 + (v_classical²)/(4 c²) ) / (1 + (v_classical²)/(2 c²) )

Simplify:

v_max = v_classical * sqrt(1 + (v_classical²)/(4 c²) ) / (1 + (v_classical²)/(2 c²) )

This is another form. If the problem expects an answer in terms of the classical speed, this might be acceptable.

Alternatively, if we rationalize:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 + (v_classical²)/(4 c²)):

v_max = v_classical * (1 + (v_classical²)/(4 c²)) / [ (1 + (v_classical²)/(2 c²)) sqrt(1 + (v_classical²)/(4 c²)) ]

But this complicates further.

Alternatively, square both sides:

(v_max / v_classical)^2 = (1 + (v_classical²)/(4 c²)) / (1 + (v_classical²)/(2 c²))^2

But this doesn't help.

Given the complexity, perhaps the answer is best left in the original energy conservation form:

v_max = c * sqrt{1 - [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2} }

Alternatively, if we write:

Let’s compute [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^{-2} = [ (2 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c²) ]^{-2} = [2 m c² / (2 m c² + k A² )]^2

Thus:

v_max = c * sqrt{1 - [2 m c² / (2 m c² + k A² )]^2 }

= c * sqrt{ [ (2 m c² + k A² )^2 - (2 m c²)^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )^2 }

Expand numerator:

(2 m c² + k A² )^2 - (2 m c²)^2 = 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 - 4 m² c^4 = 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 = k A² (4 m c² + k A² )

Thus:

v_max = c * sqrt{ k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) } / (2 m c² + k A² )

Which simplifies to:

v_max = c * A sqrt(k) sqrt(4 m c² + k A² ) / (2 m c² + k A² )

Which is the same expression as before. Therefore, this seems to be the most precise and simplified exact expression.

Alternatively, if we factor out 2 m c² from numerator and denominator:

Numerator inside sqrt:

sqrt(k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) = sqrt( k A² * 2 m c² (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ) = sqrt(2 m c² k A² ) * sqrt(2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Denominator:

2 m c² + k A² = 2 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )

Thus:

v_max = c * sqrt(2 m c² k A² ) * sqrt(2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) / [2 m c² (
