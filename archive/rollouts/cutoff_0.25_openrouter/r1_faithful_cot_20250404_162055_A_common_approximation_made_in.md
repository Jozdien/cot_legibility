# Original Question

A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons. Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this ""impulse"" approximation?

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

The impulse approximation simplifies nuclear interactions by treating nucleons as if they are free during the process. This relies on several key assumptions:

1. **Interaction with individual nucleons (Assumption 1):** The interaction current must act on single nucleons rather than involving the nucleus as a whole or multiple nucleons. This ensures the problem reduces to a one-body interaction, bypassing complex many-body effects.

2. **Nuclear transparency (Assumption 2):** The nucleus is assumed to be "transparent" except for the selected nucleon, meaning no significant interactions occur with other nucleons during the process. This avoids complications from final-state interactions or multiple scatterings.

3. **Neglecting binding forces (Assumption 4):** The selected nucleon is treated as if it experiences no nuclear binding forces, allowing its behavior to mirror that of a free nucleon. This is critical for using free-nucleon cross-sections in calculations.

**Assumption 3 (non-relativistic quarks)** is **not** required. The impulse approximation focuses on the nucleon's external state within the nucleus, not its internal quark dynamics. Relativistic quark motion in free nucleons is well-established, and this assumption does not align with the core premises of the approximation.

**Answer:** Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 jointly imply the impulse approximation. 

\boxed{1, 2, \text{ and } 4}

Alright, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations. From what I remember, the impulse approximation is used to simplify the problem by assuming that when a particle (like an electron or neutrino) interacts with a nucleon in the nucleus, the nucleon behaves as if it's free. That way, you don't have to consider all the complicated interactions between the nucleons in the nucleus when calculating the interaction. But I need to figure out which of the four given assumptions lead to this approximation.

Let me go through each assumption one by one and see how they contribute to the impulse approximation.

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**
   - If the current interacts only with individual nucleons, that means the interaction isn't with the nucleus as a whole or other nucleons simultaneously. So each interaction is a one-body process rather than two-body or more. This seems like a key part because it isolates the interaction to a single nucleon. But is this part of the impulse approximation? Maybe. The impulse approximation does require that the interaction is with a single nucleon as if it's free.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**
   - Transparency here probably means that the other nucleons don't interact with the incoming particle. So the particle just sees the nucleus as a collection of non-interfering nucleons except for the one it's interacting with. If the nucleus is transparent, it reduces the many-body problem to a single-body problem. This also sounds like part of the impulse approximation because it's neglecting the effects of the other nucleons during the interaction.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**
   - Hmm. If the quarks are non-relativistic, that would imply that the internal structure of the nucleon isn't relativistic. But does this relate to the impulse approximation? I thought the impulse approximation is about the movement of the nucleon in the nucleus, not about the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The question states "nucleons behave in the same way as free nucleons," so maybe if the quarks are relativistic in a bound nucleon but not in a free one, but they are assumed to be non-relativistic, this might not directly relate. Perhaps vice versa, but I'm not sure. Maybe this assumption isn't directly related to the impulse approximation. 

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**
   - This seems crucial. If you're assuming the nucleon isn't feeling the nuclear binding forces during the interaction, then it's effectively being treated as a free particle. That definitely ties into the concept of the impulse approximation. Without the binding forces, the nucleon's behavior would be similar to when it's free, hence allowing the use of free nucleon cross-sections or interactions.

So, putting this together, the impulse approximation likely requires that:

- The interaction is with individual nucleons (1) rather than pairs or the nucleus as a whole.
- The nucleus is transparent otherwise (2), so other nucleons don't interfere (maybe meaning that the projectile doesn't scatter multiple times or something like that).
- The interaction doesn't feel the nuclear binding (4), so the nucleon is treated as free.

Assumption 3, about the quarks, might be a red herring here. The impulse approximation is more about the nucleon's state in the nucleus rather than its internal quark structure. Unless the quark relativistic effects are part of the binding, but I don't think so. 

Wait, maybe the logic here is that if the nucleon is considered free, then you can take its internal structure (i.e., quark distribution) as the same as in free case. But the assumption 3 says that the quarks are non-relativistic. However, in reality, quarks inside nucleons are relativistic. So if you assume they are non-relativistic, is that part of making the impulse approximation? I think maybe not. Perhaps in some treatments, you might use non-relativistic motions for the quarks to simplify, but does this relate to the impulse approximation? Maybe the key approximations are 1, 2, 4. Assumption 3 is probably not part of the impulse approximation; it might be another assumption related to a different approximation, like modeling the nucleon structure.

But let's check again. The question says four assumptions "jointly imply" the impulse approximation. We're supposed to pick which of these when combined together give the impulse approximation. 

So, perhaps all the necessary premises are given here. Now, why would (3) be required? If the quarks inside the nucleon are non-relativistic, then the interaction inside the nucleon can be treated more simply. Maybe in the impulse approximation, since you’re treating the nucleon as free, you can model the internal quark structure without considering how the nucleus might affect it. But if the quark dynamics within the nucleon are relativistic in the bound state but non-relativistic when free (unlikely), or vice versa, assuming non-relativistic here allows you to treat the internal structure as free. Wait, but actually, even free nucleons have relativistic quarks.

Hold on. If the internal quarks are taken as non-relativistic in the approximation, but in reality they are relativistic, then this assumption would be necessary because when you model the nucleon in the nucleus, the potential binding might affect quark motion, making them more relativistic. If you assume that they are non-relativistic regardless of the binding (assuming nucleon is free), then that's part of the impulse approximation. However, this could be stretching it.

Alternatively, maybe (3) is not part of the impulse approximation. Common explanations of the impulse approximation in nuclear physics usually do not bring up the internal quark structure. The assumption is more about the nuclear medium not affecting the nucleon's wavefunction. If the selected nucleon is being treated as free, the binding forces from the nucleus are neglected (4), and the interaction is only with that single nucleon (1), and the nucleus is transparent (so no final state interactions, maybe, or multiple scatterings) (2).

Since possibility of (3) is quark internal being non-relativistic might be separate. Let me refer to knowledge: I recall that in the impulse approximation, one assumes that the interaction with the probe particle (like an electron) occurs with a single nucleon, treated as free (so Short Range Correlations or other effects neglected), and the nuclear environment's influence on the interaction is minimal. Transparency here might mean that the reaction is fast enough that the other nucleons do not have time to respond (frozen approximation), hence the name impulse. Additionally, by ignoring the binding forces, we can treat the nucleon's momentum as being the same as if it's free.

Therefore, the correct assumptions are likely 1,2,4. But the options want which "jointly imply", and we have four options. So is the answer all four, or a subset? Let me confirm the usual assumptions for impulse approximation.

Looking up (mentally), the impulse approximation is used in electron scattering, for example, where the electron interacts with a single nucleon, and the other nucleons are spectators. This requires that:

1. The interaction is with a single nucleon (so 1 is correct).

2. The impulse is so sudden that the nucleus doesn't have time to react (Fermi gas model often uses – this could be linked to 2, transparency).

3. The nucleon is off-shell or on-shell: but since we treat it as free, probably assuming the binding potential does not affect (4).

But in some contexts, the impulse approximation is said to neglect final-state interactions (related to transparency, assumption 2) and initial-state correlations (maybe similar to assumption 4). So these four assumptions, but perhaps 3 isn't directly related.

Alternatively, in particle physics, free nucleons are spatially extended objects made of quarks. If binding in the nucleus affected the internal quark dynamics (e.g., confined more and move relativistically), but in the impulse approximation, you ignore such effects. So assumption 3 (that quarks in the selected nucleon are non-relativistic) is incorrect. Wait, even in free nucleons, quarks are relativistic. So maybe to simplify, assuming non-relativistic quarks ignores this but perhaps that isn't part of the impulse approximation. Alternatively, perhaps in this context the impulse approximation is analogous to the static approximation where the target is heavy and free. Hmm. So if assumption 3 claims that the internal quarks are non-relativistic, then using a non-relativistic model for the nucleon's structure. However, would that be required for the impulse approximation, or is that separate? Maybe not. So probably, only 1,2,4 are needed.

But the problem presents four options, and it's given as four statements. So which ones come together? Perhaps all except 3. But wait, I need to see what each assumption is saying.

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.

So maybe that's saying that the interaction is a one-body operator, rather than two-body or more.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. So causality, the projectile doesn't interact with other nucleons once it interacts with one.

3. Internal quarks non-relativistic.

4. Selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

Hence, if 4 is true, you can treat the nucleon as free. Then assumption 1 and 2 are more about the interaction being local and with only one nucleon, without multiple interactions. Then 3 is perhaps not necessary because in reality nucleons have internal quark structure, but if we model it as non-relativistic, maybe that gives a certain cross-section. Alternatively, even if the quarks are relativistic, but because we are using free nucleon cross-sections, we don't care.

Alternatively, when you probe a nucleon in the nucleus and you model it as free, you have to assume that during the interaction, there's no other effect on the nucleon (hence 2 and 4), and the interaction is only with it (1). If the interaction also requires that the quark structure hasn't been altered (like quarks are non-relativistic same as free), but free nucleon quarks may be relativistic, so even that doesn't hold. Wait, maybe the idea is that for the interaction to proceed as if the nucleon is free, even the internal quark dynamics must not be affected by the nucleus. If the nucleus somehow caused the quarks to become non-relativistic, but in reality the quarks in free nucleons are relativistic. Then the assumption would say that in both cases (bound and free) the quarks are non-relativistic, so their internal structure isn't considered changed. However, this is a stretch. Since the premise is that the impulse approximation assumes that the nucleons behave as free, then internal quark motion would be same as free. But the problem here is the explicit statement ("quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.") If free nucleons have non-relativistic quarks (which they don't), then perhaps this assumption is making sure that even though in the nucleus, the nucleon's binding doesn't make the quarks relativistic. But given free nucleons do have relativistic quarks, this cannot be the case. Therefore, this assumption 3 might be invalid and not required. Hence, likely the answer is 1, 2, and 4.

Thus, the answer should be assumptions 1, 2, and 4.

But let me check if I missed any. Some sources mention that the impulse approximation relies on the idea that the projectile interacts with a single nucleon ("single scattering approximation") and that the binding effects are neglected. So transparency (2) would prevent multiple scattering, and neglect of binding (4) allows treating the nucleon as free. Also, (1) is required as current only interacts with individual nucleons. So yes, 1, 2,4. Option 3 isn't part of the standard impulse approximation. So the answer is options 1,2,4.

Alternatively, maybe all are needed. Let me check.

If you assume the interaction process includes the quark's nature, maybe for an accurate calculation you must consider their motion? But in the impulse approximation, you use the free nucleon cross-section. Therefore, perhaps you assume that the quark structure is the same as free, which would require that the quark's motion isn't affected by the nucleus (relativistic or non-relativistic). If interacting nucleons in the nucleus have quarks moving differently, then the cross-section would change. If the approximation is pretending it's free, then you would need to assume that the internal structure (quarks) aren't affected by the nucleus. However, given option 3 states that the quarks are non-relativistic. If, in the free case, the quarks are relativistic (more correct), then this would not correspond to a true impulse approximation. This suggests that 3 might not be part of it. Or maybe in the impulse approximation, even for free nucleons, you model them non-relativistically. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in option 3 is unrelated, and the answer is 1,2,4. Since I cannot recall any connection between the impulse approximation and quark relativistic motion, I think the answer is 1,2,4. So those three imply the nucleus behaves as free. Hence, final answer: options 1,2,4.

But let's check some other perspective. Another way to think: the impulse approximation requires that the struck nucleon does not interact with the rest of the nucleus during the interaction (so s#2 and s#4). The interaction is a one-body current (so s#1). However, for the interaction with the nucleon to proceed as if it's free, the assumption about the quarks internal to the nucleon would need that their dynamics are the same as in the free case (which would be assumption s#3 if correct). But in reality, if the nucleus's environment affects the quark dynamics in the nucleon assuming they stay non-relativistic as in free nucleons, then s#3 is necessary. Wait, but again, as before, free nucleons have internal quarks which are relativistic. Therefore, s#3 appears invalid regardless and not required. Hence, the correct answer probably excludes 3.

Alright, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations. From what I remember, the impulse approximation is used to simplify the problem by assuming that when a particle (like an electron or neutrino) interacts with a nucleon in the nucleus, the nucleon behaves as if it's free.

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**
   - If the current interacts only with individual nucleons, that means the interaction isn't with the nucleus as a whole or other nucleons simultaneously. So each interaction is a one-body process rather than two-body or more. This seems like a key part because it isolates the interaction to a single nucleon. But is this part of the impulse approximation? Maybe. The impulse approximation does require that the interaction is with a single nucleon as if it's free.

If the nucleus is transparent, it reduces the many-body problem to a single-body problem. This also sounds like part of the impulse approximation because it's neglecting the effects of the other nucleons during the interaction.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**
   - Hmm. If the quarks are non-relativistic, that would imply that the internal structure of the nucleon isn't relativistic. But does this relate to the impulse approximation? I thought the impulse approximation is about the movement of the nucleon in the nucleus, not about the internal structure of the nucleon itself. The question states "nucleons behave in the same way as free nucleons," so maybe if the quarks are relativistic in a bound nucleon but not in a free one, but they are assumed to be non-relativistic, this might not directly relate. Perhaps vice versa, but I'm not sure. Maybe this assumption isn't directly related to the impulse approximation.

# Anthropic completion

Okay, I'll attempt to understand this problem regarding the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations. I recall that the impulse approximation simplifies nuclear interactions by treating nucleons within a nucleus as essentially free particles during interactions with external particles like electrons or neutrinos. This approach avoids the complexity of calculating all nucleon-nucleon interactions within the nucleus. I need to determine which of the four given assumptions are fundamental to this approximation.

Examining each assumption individually:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**
   - This assumption focuses interactions at the single-nucleon level rather than involving the entire nucleus or multiple nucleons simultaneously. This creates a one-body interaction process, which seems essential to the impulse approximation since it isolates the interaction to individual nucleons. This likely contributes to treating the nucleon as if it were free.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**
   - This transparency concept suggests other nucleons don't affect the incoming particle's interaction with the target nucleon. This effectively transforms a complex many-body problem into a simpler single-body interaction. This appears consistent with the impulse approximation because it disregards the influence of surrounding nucleons during the interaction.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**
   - This relates to the internal structure of individual nucleons rather than their behavior within the nucleus. The impulse approximation primarily concerns how nucleons move and interact within the nuclear environment, not their internal quark dynamics. This assumption might not directly connect to the impulse approximation, which focuses on nucleon-level behavior rather than quark-level phenomena.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**
   - This seems fundamentally important for the impulse approximation. By assuming the nucleon doesn't feel nuclear binding forces during interactions, it's treated exactly like a free particle. This directly enables the use of free nucleon cross-sections and interaction calculations within the nuclear context.

Synthesizing these points, the impulse approximation likely requires:
- Individual nucleon interactions (assumption 1)
- Nuclear transparency except for the target nucleon (assumption 2)
- Absence of binding forces during interactions (assumption 4)

Assumption 3 about non-relativistic quarks might be unrelated, as the impulse approximation focuses on nucleon behavior in the nucleus rather than quark dynamics

Certainly! Here's the rephrased text:

Let me attempt to tackle this problem. The question pertains to the impulse approximation in the context of many-body nuclear calculations. As I recall, the impulse approximation simplifies the issue by assuming that when a particle, such as an electron or neutrino, interacts with a nucleon within the nucleus, the nucleon acts as though it is free. Consequently, this approach eliminates the need to consider the intricate interactions among nucleons within the nucleus when assessing the interaction. I need to determine which of the four provided assumptions lead to this approximation.

I'll examine each assumption individually to understand its contribution to the impulse approximation.

1. **The interaction current engages solely with individual nucleons.**
   - If the current affects only individual nucleons, this implies that the interaction is limited to one nucleon at a time rather than involving the entire nucleus or multiple nucleons simultaneously. This isolates the interaction to a single nucleon and appears fundamental, as the impulse approximation necessitates engaging with a single nucleon as if it's unconstrained.

2. **The nucleus is transparent except for the specified nucleon.**
   - Here, transparency likely suggests that the other nucleons don't engage with the incoming particle. The particle perceives the nucleus as a group of non-interfering nucleons, except for the one it interacts with. This transparency reduces the many-body problem to a single-body problem, aligning with the impulse approximation, as it disregards the influence of other nucleons during the interaction.

3. **The internal quarks of the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**
   - If the quarks are non-relativistic, it suggests that the nucleon's internal composition isn't relativistic. However, how does this relate to the impulse approximation? I believed the impulse approximation concerns the nucleon's movement within the nucleus, not its internal composition. The question specifies that "nucleons behave like free nucleons," so perhaps there’s an assumption that if quarks are relativistic in a bound nucleon but non-relativistic in a free state, this might not be directly related. It seems this assumption might not be directly tied to the impulse approximation.

4. **The interaction occurs as though the selected nucleon is free from binding forces.**
   - This appears vital. Assuming the nucleon isn't experiencing nuclear binding forces during interaction implies it's effectively treated as a free particle, closely related to the impulse approximation. With no binding forces, the nucleon's behavior resembles that of a free particle, allowing the use of free nucleon cross-sections or interactions.

In summary, the impulse approximation probably requires that:

- The interaction involves individual nucleons (1) instead of pairs or the nucleus as a whole.
- The nucleus is otherwise transparent (2), preventing interference from other nucleons (perhaps suggesting the projectile doesn’t undergo multiple scattering events).
- The interaction isn't influenced by nuclear binding (4), thus the nucleon is regarded as free.

Assumption 3, concerning quarks, might be misleading here. The impulse approximation is more focused on the nucleon's role within the nucleus than on its internal quark structure.

But I don\'t think that\'s a standard part of the impulse approximation. In fact, in reality, quarks are relativistic inside nucleons, regardless of whether the nucleon is free or bound. So if you assume they\'re non-relativistic, perhaps it\'s a way to ignore any changes due to the nuclear medium affecting the quark structure. Hmmm.\n\nWait, the impulse approximation as I recall usually assumes that during the short interaction time, the nucleon doesn\'t have time to interact with the surrounding nucleus (that\'s sometimes called the "frozen nucleus" approximation).

The other nucleons don\'t influence the interaction (maybe assumption 2 and 4?).\n\nBut maybe transparency (2) is more about the projectile not interacting with other nucleons, while assumption 4 is about the binding forces not affecting the nucleon during the interaction. So the combination would mean that as the incoming particle interacts with a nucleon, the nucleon is effectively free (no binding forces) and the rest of the nucleus doesn\'t interact (transparent). Thus, the nucleus\'s effect is only to provide the momentum distribution of the nucleons (Fermi motion), but during the interaction, the nucleon is treated as free.\n\nTherefore, maybe assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are necessary.\n\nBut wait, the question says "which of the four assumptions jointly imply this?". Are we supposed to select multiple? The options given don\'t specify; the question is written as "Which of the four assumptions...", but typically in such questions, the answer might be more than one. Wait, the wording is: "Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this", so they might require a combination of these assumptions.\n\nBut the options are actually statements 1 to 4. So in the list, which of the four is required? Typically, multiple-choice questions, but here the user hasn\'t given options as A to D but as four statements. So maybe the answer is multiple.\n\nBut let me check the key points.\n\nAssumption 1: Interaction only with individual nucleons. Necessary because if the current interacted with multiple nucleons at once (like meson exchange currents), that would complicate things beyond the impulse approximation. So yes, 1 is necessary.\n\nAssumption 2: Nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. That\'s part of the impulse approximation. If the projectile could interact with other nucleons, then you have multiple scatterings or shielding effects, which would not be the impulse approximation. Transparency would imply that once the projectile interacts with one nucleon, it doesn\'t interact with others. So needed.\n\nAssumption 3: Quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmmm, this is tricky. The impulse approximation usually is not concerned with the internal structure of the nucleon. The impulse approximation in scattering is about treating the target particle (nucleon) as free, i.e., its wavefunction is not modified by the surrounding nucleus. If the nucleon\'s internal structure (i.e., quark dynamics) is relativistic but unchanged from free, you might still use the impulse approximation. However, if binding the nucleon into the nucleus causes the internal quark structure to become relativistic, but you ignore that, i.e., assume they are non-relativistic as in free nucleons, then maybe 3 is necessary.\n\nBut I think the standard impulse approximation ignores the modification of the nucleon structure in the medium. But whether that requires assuming quarks are non-relativistic? That might not be. For example, in electron scattering, even if the nucleon\'s quarks are relativistic, the impulse approximation is used by taking the free nucleon form factors. So maybe it\'s not that the quarks are non-relativistic, but rather that the nucleon itself is moving non-relativistically (Fermi motion), but the internal structure is the same. Thus, assumption 3 might not be necessary. Unless the assumption is that the quark structure isn\'t affected by the nucleus, which would be another thing, but the way assumption 3 is phrased is "quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic," which seems to refer to their motion inside the nucleon, not the nucleon\'s motion in the nucleus.\n\nSo maybe assumption 3 is not related. The nucleus being transparent (2) and binding forces not affecting (4) are more about the environment, whereas 1 is about the interaction being a single-nucleon process. So with 1, 2, and 4, we have the impulse approximation since if the selected nucleon is treated as free (4), the nucleus doesn\'t affect the projectile otherwise (2), and the current only interacts with individual nucleons (1). Therefore, maybe 1, 2, and 4. But the question says "jointly imply," so maybe all three are needed. The possible answers given the way the options are listed, maybe the answer is these three. However, the options are 1-4, numbered. Let me check another angle.\n\nAlternatively, in the impulse approximation, it\'s sometimes based on the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) in scattering, where the ejected nucleon is assumed to not interact with the residual nucleus (transparent). Also, the interaction is with a single nucleon (1), and the nucleon is off-shell but approximated as on-shell (which relates to 4—no binding forces-- binding would cause off-shell effects). So if you consider that the impulse approximation assumes that the interaction occurs as if the nucleon is free (4), and the rest of the nucleus is transparent (2), and that the current is a one-body current (1). So 1, 2, 4. 3 is unrelated. So likely 1, 2, 4.\n\nThus, the answer should be 1, 2, 4. Therefore, among the given options, these three. But since in the original question it\'s multiple-choice but here it\'s presented as four statements, perhaps the answer is options 1, 2, and 4. However, since the question is presented in a way where it\'s four possible statements, and we have to pick which joint assumptions... but perhaps statements 1,2,4.\n\nWait, the OP hasn\'t specified the options as A-D; instead, they just listed four numbered assumptions. So the answer is the combination of three of these: 1, 2, 4. Therefore, the correct answer should be those three. Let me confirm. Suppose someone says the impulse approximation uses the idea that the particle interacts with one nucleon, which is free (4), the nucleus is transparent (2), and the interaction is only with individual nucleons (1). So these three.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1,2,4. The third statement about quarks is not part of the impulse approximation.

The **impulse approximation** in many-body nuclear calculations relies on treating nucleons as free particles during interactions. The key assumptions that jointly imply this approximation are:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**  
   This isolates the interaction to a single nucleon, avoiding complexities from multi-nucleon processes.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**  
   This ensures the incoming particle interacts only with the target nucleon, neglecting scattering or screening from others.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**  
   By ignoring nuclear binding effects, the nucleon’s behavior mimics that of a free particle during the interaction.

**Assumption 3** (non-relativistic quarks) is unrelated, as the impulse approximation concerns the nucleon’s environment, not its internal quark dynamics.

3 is talking about the nucleon's overall motion being non-relativistic, but the statement specifically says "quarks internal to the selected nucleon." That seems more like a different assumption, maybe related to whether the nucleon structure is altered due to binding, but if the quarks are non-relativistic inside the nucleon, maybe in a bound state vs free? But I don't think that's a standard part of the impulse approximation. In fact, in reality, quarks are relativistic inside nucleons, regardless of whether the nucleon is free or bound. So if you assume they're non-relativistic, perhaps it's a way to ignore any changes due to the nuclear medium affecting the quark structure. Hmmm.

Wait, the impulse approximation as I recall usually assumes that during the short interaction time, the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with the surrounding nucleus (that's sometimes called the "frozen nucleus" approximation). So the approximations involved are that:

1. The interaction is a one-body current (meaning assumption 1 is needed).

2. The other nucleons don't influence the interaction (maybe assumption 2 and 4?).

But maybe transparency (2) is more about the projectile not interacting with other nucleons, while assumption 4 is about the binding forces not affecting the nucleon during the interaction. So the combination would mean that as the incoming particle interacts with a nucleon, the nucleon is effectively free (no binding forces) and the rest of the nucleus doesn't interact (transparent). Thus, the nucleus's effect is only to provide the momentum distribution of the nucleons (Fermi motion), but during the interaction, the nucleon is treated as free.

Therefore, maybe assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are necessary.

But wait, the question says "which of the four assumptions jointly imply this?". Are we supposed to select multiple? The options given don't specify; the question is written as "Which of the four assumptions...", but typically in such questions, the answer might be more than one. Wait, the wording is: "Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this", so they might require a combination of these assumptions.

But the options are actually statements 1 to 4. So in the list, which of the four is required? Typically, multiple-choice questions, but here the user hasn't given options as A to D but as four statements. So maybe the answer is multiple.

But let me check the key points.

Assumption 1: Interaction only with individual nucleons. Necessary because if the current interacted with multiple nucleons at once (like meson exchange currents), that would complicate things beyond the impulse approximation. So yes, 1 is necessary.

Assumption 2: Nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. That's part of the impulse approximation. If the projectile could interact with other nucleons, then you have multiple scatterings or shielding effects, which would not be the impulse approximation. Transparency would imply that once the projectile interacts with one nucleon, it doesn't interact with others. So needed.

Assumption 3: Quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmmm, this is tricky. The impulse approximation usually is not concerned with the internal structure of the nucleon. The impulse approximation in scattering is about treating the target particle (nucleon) as free, i.e., its wavefunction is not modified by the surrounding nucleus. If the nucleon's internal structure (i.e., quark dynamics) is relativistic but unchanged from free, you might still use the impulse approximation. However, if binding the nucleon into the nucleus causes the internal quark structure to become relativistic, but you ignore that, i.e., assume they are non-relativistic as in free nucleons, then maybe 3 is necessary.

But I think the standard impulse approximation ignores the modification of the nucleon structure in the medium. But whether that requires assuming quarks are non-relativistic? That might not be. For example, in electron scattering, even if the nucleon's quarks are relativistic, the impulse approximation is used by taking the free nucleon form factors. So maybe it's not that the quarks are non-relativistic, but rather that the nucleon itself is moving non-relativistically (Fermi motion), but the internal structure is the same. Thus, assumption 3 might not be necessary. Unless the assumption is that the quark structure isn't affected by the nucleus, which would be another thing, but the way assumption 3 is phrased is "quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic," which seems to refer to their motion inside the nucleon, not the nucleon's motion in the nucleus.

So maybe assumption 3 is not related. The nucleus being transparent (2) and binding forces not affecting (4) are more about the environment, whereas 1 is about the interaction being a single-nucleon process. So with 1, 2, and 4, we have the impulse approximation since if the selected nucleon is treated as free (4), the nucleus doesn't affect the projectile otherwise (2), and the current only interacts with individual nucleons (1). Therefore, maybe 1, 2, and 4. But the question says "jointly imply," so maybe all three are needed. The possible answers given the way the options are listed, maybe the answer is these three. However, the options are 1-4, numbered. Let me check another angle.

Alternatively, in the impulse approximation, it's sometimes based on the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) in scattering, where the ejected nucleon is assumed to not interact with the residual nucleus (transparent). Also, the interaction is with a single nucleon (1), and the nucleon is off-shell but approximated as on-shell (which relates to 4—no binding forces-- binding would cause off-shell effects). So if you consider that the impulse approximation assumes that the interaction occurs as if the nucleon is free (4), and the rest of the nucleus is transparent (2), and that the current is a one-body current (1). So 1, 2, 4. 3 is unrelated. So likely 1, 2, 4.

Thus, the answer should be 1, 2, 4. Therefore, among the given options, these three. But since in the original question it's multiple-choice but here it's presented as four statements, perhaps the answer is options 1, 2, and 4. However, since the question is presented in a way where it's four possible statements, and we have to pick which joint assumptions... but perhaps statements 1,2,4.

Wait, the OP hasn't specified the options as A-D; instead, they just listed four numbered assumptions. So the answer is the combination of three of these: 1, 2, 4. Therefore, the correct answer should be those three. Let me confirm. Suppose someone says the impulse approximation uses the idea that the particle interacts with one nucleon, which is free (4), the nucleus is transparent (2), and the interaction is only with individual nucleons (1). So these three.

Therefore, the answer should be 1,2,4. The third statement about quarks is not part of the impulse approximation. Thus, the final answer is 1,2,4.

Wait, the original problem states "which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this \'impulse\' approximation?" So out of the four options 1-4, which subset is correct?\n\nAfter checking authoritative sources (summoning my existing knowledge), I recall that the impulse approximation usually involves two main assumptions: \n\n1. The projectile interacts with a single nucleon (i.e., single scattering), and the effects of the nuclear medium on the interaction are neglected. This would correspond to the idea that the interaction happens as if the nucleon is free (no binding forces). Also, that multiple interactions or other nucleons\' presence don\'t influence the process.\n\nBut let me elaborate. The impulse approximation is often associated with the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA) in scattering theory, where the incoming and outgoing particles are considered to be plane waves, implying that the scattering happens instantaneously with a single nucleon, and the others don\'t interact. In this context, PWIA assumes that the struck nucleon doesn\'t interact with the residual nucleus during the collision, so the nuclear transparency (like in 2) and the nucleon being free (4). Also, the interaction current must be with individual nucleons (1). \n\nThe third assumption (quarks being non-relativistic). If the quarks are non-relativistic, then maybe the nucleon\'s internal structure isn’t affected by relativistic effects, but I think this is a separate assumption. For example, in electron scattering, even if the nucleus is a many-body system, modeling using the impulse approximation often ignores the modifications to the nucleon\'s internal structure due to the nuclear medium (this is sometimes referred to as "no off-shell effects"). But maybe assumption 3, by stating that quarks are non-relativistic, ensures that the nucleon structure functions mirror those of free nucleons. However, in reality, even bound nucleons might have relativistic quarks. Since the approximation assumes nucleons act free, if internucleon binding doesn\'t lead to relativistic quark motion (something that could alter their structure), then ensuring non-relativistic quarks would preserve their free structure. So maybe (3) is part of maintaining the free nucleon structure. \n\nIf (3) is required for the interaction, then perhaps all four are needed? But more accurately, I think (3) may or may not be a necessary assumption.\n\nLet me check traditional explanations. The key points of the impulse approximation are:\n\n1. Single collision: The interaction involves a single nucleon, not multiple. So the nucleus seems transparent beyond that nucleon (2), and interaction is only with individual nucleons (1).  \n2. The struck nucleon is free during the interaction (4), i.e., its binding is temporarily ignored.  \n3. Final state interactions are neglected, implying the nucleus doesn\'t "respond" during the interaction (perhaps related to transparency in (2)), but that is related to (2) and (4). \n\nAssumption 3 about quarks being non-relativistic isn\'t usually emphasized. So in standard explanations (like in electron scattering, the impulse approximation would use free nucleon form factors, assuming the nuclear medium doesn\'t modify the internal quark structure). Therefore, one could assume that assumption 3 is necessary because if the nuclear environment made the quarks relativistic, the nucleon wouldn\'t act as a free one. However, in reality, nucleons, even in nuclei, have quarks moving relativistically. Since the premise is an approximation, to maintain the free-nucleon behavior, maybe assuming that binding doesn\'t alter internal quark kinematics (i.e., keeps them non-relativistic) is required. But I think traditionally, the impulse approximation doesn’t necessarily require non-relativistic quarks given that even free nucleons have relativistic quarks. This inconsistency suggests perhaps (3) is not a requirement.\n\nAlternatively, because the impulse approximation often applies to processes where the momentum transfer is high, hence the interaction time is short (time-energy uncertainty principle), but that might mean that during this short time, the binding isn\'t as relevant (i.e., adiabatic approximation), making (4) valid without (3). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the internucleon binding may involve the nucleons being off-shell (i.e., not free) but in the impulse approximation they are treated as on-shell (free) during interaction regardless. This requires neglecting binding forces (4), but quark dynamics within the nucleon could be considered separate.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct combination is 1,2,4.

Alternatively, 3 might also be required because if the internal quark motion is relativistic, then even if the nucleon is free, the structure would differ from a free nucleon with non-relativistic quarks. But in reality, free nucleons have quarks moving relativistically; hence, assuming non-relativistic might lead to discrepancies.\n\nBut perhaps in the context where the approximation is made for non-relativistic nucleons and quark structure is not an issue (for example, in low-energy processes), but the question states "interaction is electroweak," which generally would involve relativistic effects. Hence, maybe (3) isn\'t required. Alternatively, the answer could be 1,2,4. Maybe this? Some sources:\n\nReferences like "Theoretical Nuclear Physics" by Amos de Shalit and Herman Feshbach would outline such approximations. Specifically, in the PWIA for electron scattering, the approximation is:\n\n- The electron interacts with a single nucleon via a one-body current (assumption 1).\n- The other nucleons are spectators, implying transparency (2).\n- The struck nucleon is assumed to be free, instantaneous in the interaction (4).\n\nThus, these (1,2,4) constitute the impulse approximation. There\'s no talk about the quark structure\'s relativistic nature – that may be part of the assumption about the nucleon\'s structure being the same as in free space. Hence, perhaps (3) is not needed.\n\nThus, the answer must be that assumptions 1,2,4 jointly imply the impulse approximation, so the answer would be options 1,2,4. But given that the problem states which of the four implies, maybe associating the selections. Confusion may arise here, but I think in reality, (3) may not be required, so 1,2,4 are the correct assumptions. But need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer includes (3). Let me think again: if quarks in bound nucleons were influenced by nuclear binding, leading to relativistic internal motion that differs from free nucleons, and in the impulse approximation, which assumes free nucleon structure, this would need the assumption that the quarks’ motion isn\'t affected (e.g., non-relativistic). But historically, the effect of the nuclear medium on quark structure is considered separately, part of, for instance, the EMC effect. Hence, two different concepts. Hence, the assumption that the quark structure is unaltered (though it is altered in reality) would necessitate (3), but historically, the impulse approximation doesn\'t account for that effect and hence perhaps implicitly considers the internal structure unchanged. But is (3) a needed premise?\n\nThe problem\'s phrasing includes "interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces" (4). If (4) includes that the binding forces don’t affect the internal structure (i.e., quark motion), then maybe (3) is redundant. However, assumption (4) perhaps refers to the nucleon’s motion (being bound in the nucleus causing Fermi motion but no effective binding forces during the interaction). The quarks\' internal state requires another assumption. Seems like these are separate. Since the question lists all four points, maybe to form the impulse approximation, one needs to ensure that inside the nucleon, the quark dynamics are the same as in free nucleons, hence (3). Otherwise, even if forces are neglected (4), quark effects from binding could differ.\n\nBut if the nuclear environment affects quark motion (making it relativistic), but the approximation assumes the nucleon is free, thus quarks are non-relativistic. Even if in reality, quarks in a free nucleon are relativistic, in the model, perhaps assuming non-relativistic is done. Hmm, this seems contradictory, as a free nucleon\'s quarks are actually not non-relativistic. Hence, I might be overcomplicating. The standard impulse approximation does not usually reference quark states but assumes that the nucleon\'s description (in terms of form factors, etc.) is similar to free. Hence, maybe (3) is not required.\n\nConsidering standard literature, I think only 1,2,4 are standard assumptions for the impulse approximation.\n\nThus, the answer must d) Options 1, 2, and 4.

However, the problem reads "Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply...", so it\'s a multiple-select question (possible more than one option is correct) but presented as the four given. Wait common physics problems: e.g., Pick all that apply, but if according to our analysis, the answer is (1), (2), and (4). The problem states "four assumptions jointly imply"—so we\'re to choose which are required. So the answer is (1) interaction only with individual nucleons, (2) nucleus transparent except selected nucleon, and (4) no binding forces during interaction. Hence these three, but options 1,2,4.

To determine which assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation, we analyze each of the given options:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**
   - This isolates the interaction to a single nucleon, which is fundamental for the impulse approximation.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**
   - This implies that other nucleons do not interfere with the interaction, reducing the problem to a single-body interaction.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**
   - This assumption is not typically related to the impulse approximation, as it concerns the internal quark structure rather than the nucleon's behavior in the nucleus.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**
   - Assuming no binding forces allows the nucleon to behave as if it were free, which is crucial for the impulse approximation.

The impulse approximation relies on the interaction being with individual nucleons (1), the nucleus being transparent otherwise (2), and the nucleon being free from binding forces during the interaction (4). The internal quark dynamics (3) are not a standard consideration for this approximation.

### Final Answer

\boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, \boxed{4}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Unless assuming non-relativistic quarks aids in simplifying the nucleon's interaction, but usually, considering nucleons as point particles might require specific internal behavior.

So, principles 1, 2, and 4 might collectively form the impulse approximation. However, the question specifies which four assumptions **jointly** imply the approximation, but only four options are given, which naturally list four, and the answer would have to select among these. Wait, the original problem states "which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this 'impulse' approximation?" So out of the four options 1-4, which subset is correct?

After checking authoritative sources (summoning my existing knowledge), I recall that the impulse approximation usually involves two main assumptions: 

1. The projectile interacts with a single nucleon (i.e., single scattering), and the effects of the nuclear medium on the interaction are neglected. This would correspond to the idea that the interaction happens as if the nucleon is free (no binding forces). Also, that multiple interactions or other nucleons' presence don't influence the process.

But let me elaborate. The impulse approximation is often associated with the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA) in scattering theory, where the incoming and outgoing particles are considered to be plane waves, implying that the scattering happens instantaneously with a single nucleon, and the others don't interact. In this context, PWIA assumes that the struck nucleon doesn't interact with the residual nucleus during the collision, so the nuclear transparency (like in 2) and the nucleon being free (4). Also, the interaction current must be with individual nucleons (1). 

The third assumption (quarks being non-relativistic). If the quarks are non-relativistic, then maybe the nucleon's internal structure isn’t affected by relativistic effects, but I think this is a separate assumption. For example, in electron scattering, even if the nucleus is a many-body system, modeling using the impulse approximation often ignores the modifications to the nucleon's internal structure due to the nuclear medium (this is sometimes referred to as "no off-shell effects"). But maybe assumption 3, by stating that quarks are non-relativistic, ensures that the nucleon structure functions mirror those of free nucleons. However, in reality, even bound nucleons might have relativistic quarks. Since the approximation assumes nucleons act free, if internucleon binding doesn't lead to relativistic quark motion (something that could alter their structure), then ensuring non-relativistic quarks would preserve their free structure. So maybe (3) is part of maintaining the free nucleon structure. 

If (3) is required for the interaction, then perhaps all four are needed? But more accurately, I think (3) may or may not be a necessary assumption.

Let me check traditional explanations. The key points of the impulse approximation are:

1. Single collision: The interaction involves a single nucleon, not multiple. So the nucleus seems transparent beyond that nucleon (2), and interaction is only with individual nucleons (1).  
2. The struck nucleon is free during the interaction (4), i.e., its binding is temporarily ignored.  
3. Final state interactions are neglected, implying the nucleus doesn't "respond" during the interaction (perhaps related to transparency in (2)), but that is related to (2) and (4). 

Assumption 3 about quarks being non-relativistic isn't usually emphasized. So in standard explanations (like in electron scattering, the impulse approximation would use free nucleon form factors, assuming the nuclear medium doesn't modify the internal quark structure). Therefore, one could assume that assumption 3 is necessary because if the nuclear environment made the quarks relativistic, the nucleon wouldn't act as a free one. However, in reality, nucleons, even in nuclei, have quarks moving relativistically. Since the premise is an approximation, to maintain the free-nucleon behavior, maybe assuming that binding doesn't alter internal quark kinematics (i.e., keeps them non-relativistic) is required. But I think traditionally, the impulse approximation doesn’t necessarily require non-relativistic quarks given that even free nucleons have relativistic quarks. This inconsistency suggests perhaps (3) is not a requirement.

Alternatively, because the impulse approximation often applies to processes where the momentum transfer is high, hence the interaction time is short (time-energy uncertainty principle), but that might mean that during this short time, the binding isn't as relevant (i.e., adiabatic approximation), making (4) valid without (3). 

Alternatively, perhaps the internucleon binding may involve the nucleons being off-shell (i.e., not free) but in the impulse approximation they are treated as on-shell (free) during interaction regardless. This requires neglecting binding forces (4), but quark dynamics within the nucleon could be considered separate.

Therefore, perhaps the correct combination is 1,2,4. But original options are 1 to 4. To jointlh imply.

Wait, but the correct answer in textbooks is listed as assumptions 1,2, and 4.

But according to the choices given, options 1,2,4 are needed, but depending on the evaluation, is there an issue? Alternatively, 3 might also be required because if the internal quark motion is relativistic, then even if the nucleon is free, the structure would differ from a free nucleon with non-relativistic quarks. But in reality, free nucleons have quarks moving relativistically; hence, assuming non-relativistic might lead to discrepancies.

But perhaps in the context where the approximation is made for non-relativistic nucleons and quark structure is not an issue (for example, in low-energy processes), but the question states "interaction is electroweak," which generally would involve relativistic effects. Hence, maybe (3) isn't required. Alternatively, the answer could be 1,2,4. Maybe this? Some sources:

References like "Theoretical Nuclear Physics" by Amos de Shalit and Herman Feshbach would outline such approximations. Specifically, in the PWIA for electron scattering, the approximation is:

- The electron interacts with a single nucleon via a one-body current (assumption 1).
- The other nucleons are spectators, implying transparency (2).
- The struck nucleon is assumed to be free, instantaneous in the interaction (4).

Thus, these (1,2,4) constitute the impulse approximation. There's no talk about the quark structure's relativistic nature – that may be part of the assumption about the nucleon's structure being the same as in free space. Hence, perhaps (3) is not needed.

Thus, the answer must be that assumptions 1,2,4 jointly imply the impulse approximation, so the answer would be options 1,2,4. But given that the problem states which of the four implies, maybe associating the selections. Confusion may arise here, but I think in reality, (3) may not be required, so 1,2,4 are the correct assumptions. But need to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer includes (3). Let me think again: if quarks in bound nucleons were influenced by nuclear binding, leading to relativistic internal motion that differs from free nucleons, and in the impulse approximation, which assumes free nucleon structure, this would need the assumption that the quarks’ motion isn't affected (e.g., non-relativistic). But historically, the effect of the nuclear medium on quark structure is considered separately, part of, for instance, the EMC effect. Hence, two different concepts. Hence, the assumption that the quark structure is unaltered (though it is altered in reality) would necessitate (3), but historically, the impulse approximation doesn't account for that effect and hence perhaps implicitly considers the internal structure unchanged. But is (3) a needed premise?

The problem's phrasing includes "interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces" (4). If (4) includes that the binding forces don’t affect the internal structure (i.e., quark motion), then maybe (3) is redundant. However, assumption (4) perhaps refers to the nucleon’s motion (being bound in the nucleus causing Fermi motion but no effective binding forces during the interaction). The quarks' internal state requires another assumption. Seems like these are separate. Since the question lists all four points, maybe to form the impulse approximation, one needs to ensure that inside the nucleon, the quark dynamics are the same as in free nucleons, hence (3). Otherwise, even if forces are neglected (4), quark effects from binding could differ.

But if the nuclear environment affects quark motion (making it relativistic), but the approximation assumes the nucleon is free, thus quarks are non-relativistic. Even if in reality, quarks in a free nucleon are relativistic, in the model, perhaps assuming non-relativistic is done. Hmm, this seems contradictory, as a free nucleon's quarks are actually not non-relativistic. Hence, I might be overcomplicating. The standard impulse approximation does not usually reference quark states but assumes that the nucleon's description (in terms of form factors, etc.) is similar to free. Hence, maybe (3) is not required.

Considering standard literature, I think only 1,2,4 are standard assumptions for the impulse approximation.

Thus, the answer must d) Options 1, 2, and 4. But how has the original options listed numerically?

Wait, given original numbering for options 1 to 4.

The answer should be 1,2,4. But since selection may require all correct options presumably. Depending on the convention, the question provides four options, and possibly multiple are correct, but constructed as four, and the user had to list which of the four – that is, which subset – include all that are needed. However, the problem reads "Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply...", so it's a multiple-select question (possible more than one option is correct) but presented as the four given. Wait common physics problems: e.g., Pick all that apply, but if according to our analysis, the answer is (1), (2), and (4). The problem states "four assumptions jointly imply"—so we're to choose which are required. So the answer is (1) interaction only with individual nucleons, (2) nucleus transparent except selected nucleon, and (4) no binding forces during interaction. Hence these three, but options 1,2,4. If the label options are numbered 1-4, the answer probably selects 1,2,4.

But the problem doesn’t present options as checkboxes; the original setup probably in the real problem is a multiple-choice, but now presented as user generated. But in the user's original instructions, it says "Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this "impulse" approximation?" Concluding, likely Answer: assumptions 1, 2, and 4. So need to select these. Assumption 3 is immaterial or unexplained in standard impulse approx.

So Hence, the answer is options 1,2, and4.

Therefore, numbers are 1, 2,4.

Since the provided answer in Oli will prompt as boxed numbers, I think the answer is \boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, and \boxed{4}. Wait, but how is the answer expected here? Probably as boxed numbers separated by commas. Depending on conventions in the user’s instructions; but in education quizzes often when multiple correct options are numbered, the answer is all correct digits separated. So perhaps here is \boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, \boxed{4}. But some platforms require enumeration in a single box.

Wait, but since the question states "which of the following four assumptions jointly imply"—a single answer (covering all the necessary ones). Hence if 1,2,4 positive, but list environment requires using the boxes. For example, in the APS exams, often a question like this would have answer options like A)1 and2, B)2 and4 etc. But as per user's original setup, they want “which” {four}(?) but implying select all that apply. For standardized input, the AI should output them enclosed in boxed. But in the readme, it says "put your final answer within \boxed{}." So here, maybe indicating all the applicable numbers. So the answer is 1, 2, and4., so \boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, \boxed{4}. But the system might want in a single box grouped, usually in multiple-choice with A)1,2,3 or other digits. But original instruction says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", so perhaps comma-separated in a single box.

Various possible. For instance, perhaps he answer options were given in a multiple-choice with named options but here the system connects the answer choices: given the specified numbers. Since the original problem isunknown but the four options are given in the natural list style. Hence, writing within a single box the numbers:

\boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, \boxed{4}

But the user might expect\boxed{1,2,4} but standard LaTeX \boxed{1, 2, 4} is the composite.

For that purpose, since combinations should answer with ordered numbers as given, then [1,2,4]  , written as \boxed{1,2,4}.

**Final Answer**

The assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are those numbered \boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, and \boxed{4}.
