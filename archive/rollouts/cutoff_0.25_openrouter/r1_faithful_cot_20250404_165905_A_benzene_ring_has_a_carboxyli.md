To determine the IUPAC name for the given molecule, we start by placing the substituents on a benzene ring according to the provided spatial relationships:

1. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is fixed at position 1.
2. The carbaldehyde group (-CHO), cyano group (-CN), and carboxylic acid group are meta to each other, placing them at positions 1, 3, and 5.
3. The hydroxyl group (-OH) and dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) are ortho to the carboxylic acid, occupying positions 2 and 6.
4. The methoxy group (-OCH3) is para to the carboxylic acid at position 4.
5. The methoxy group (position 4) and hydroxyl group (position 6) are ortho to the cyano group (position 5).

After confirming the positions of all substituents, the numbering is optimized to give the lowest possible locants for the highest priority groups. The substituents are then listed in alphabetical order in the IUPAC name, excluding the principal functional group (carboxylic acid), which is used as the suffix.

The substituents and their positions are:
- Carboxylic acid (-COOH) at position 1
- Cyano (-CN) at position 3
- Formyl (-CHO) at position 5
- Hydroxyl (-OH) at position 6
- Methoxy (-OCH3) at position 4
- Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) at position 2

The correct IUPAC name is formed by listing the substituents in alphabetical order as prefixes, followed by the parent name "benzoic acid."

\boxed{3-cyano-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Alright, let me try to figure out the IUPAC name for this benzene derivative. The problem statement is pretty detailed, so I need to parse it carefully. Let's start by visualizing the benzene ring and placing the substituents as described.

First, the main substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group. All three of these are meta to each other. Then, there are more groups: ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group and a dimethyl amino group. Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the hydroxyl (alcohol) are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano group). This seems complex, so I need to map this step by step.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Starting with the benzene ring. Let's fix the position of the carboxylic acid as position 1. Then, since the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to each other, each of these must be two positions apart. So if carboxylic acid is at 1, then the carbaldehyde would be at position 3 (meta), and the cyano group at position 5 (also meta to 1). But wait, meta positions are 1,3,5? No, each is two carbons away. In a benzene ring, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. Meta to 1 would be 3 and 5. So if carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the carbaldehyde and cyano must be at 3 and 5. Wait, but it says all three are meta to one another. That means each of them is meta to the other two. Let me confirm: in a benzene ring, for three groups all to be meta to each other, they must be at positions 1,3,5, forming a sort of triangle. So perhaps, the three groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are each in positions 1, 3, and 5. But let me confirm this.

Alternatively, if three groups are each meta to each other, how would they be arranged? For example, three groups each separated by one carbon. Wait, in a benzene ring, for three groups all meta to each other, their positions are such that no two are adjacent (ortho) or opposite (para). But in a six-membered ring, three groups can't all be meta to each other unless they are at alternate positions such that each is two positions away from the others. Wait, actually that might not be possible with three groups because if you place the first at position 1, the next at 3, then the third can't be placed at 5 (because position 5 is meta to 1, but 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6, so if there's a group at 5, how is it meta to group 3? Wait: between position 3 and 5, there is one carbon (position 4). So the distance between 3 and 5 is two carbons (since 3 to 4 is one, then 5). So that's also meta. Wait, yes, groups at 1,3,5 are all two carbons apart: 1 to 3 is two positions, then 3 to 5 is two positions, etc. So that's a possible arrangement where all three are meta.

So, the three main groups: carboxylic acid (let's fix at 1), carbaldehyde at 3, cyano at 5. Now, let's go on to the other substituents.

Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Ortho positions to 1 are 2 and 6. So at positions 2 and 6, there's a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethyl amino group (N(CH3)2). Wait, but then we need to determine which is which. Also, para to the carboxylic acid (position 1) is a methoxy group (OCH3). Para position to 1 is position 4. So position 4 is OCH3.

Additionally, the methoxy (position 4) and the hydroxyl (either 2 or 6) are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano) group. The nitrile is at 5. So ortho to 5 would be positions 4 and 6. Therefore, the methoxy group is already at 4, which is ortho to cyano (5), and then the hydroxyl or the dimethylamino should be at 6, which is ortho to 5. Wait, the methoxy is at 4 (ortho to 5; yes, because 4 and 5 are adjacent) – but wait, position 5 is cyano. So then, we know the methoxy at 4 is ortho to cyano. But the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino are both ortho to the carboxylic acid (1), which are positions 2 and 6. But methoxy (4) and the hydroxyl (if it's at 6) would both be ortho to cyano. Let's resolve this.

So for the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino: the problem says that "Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino". So carboxy at 1, and then positions 2 and 6. Let me assign hydroxyl to position 2 and dimethyl amino to position 6. Then, the para position to 1 is position 4 (OCH3). Now, the methoxy (4) and the hydroxyl (2) should both be ortho to nitrile? Wait. The cyano is at 5, which is adjacent to positions 4 and 6. So ortho to cyano (5) would be 4 and 6. The methoxy is at 4 (yes), and also, the hydroxyl is at 2 (not adjacent to 5). But wait, the problem states that the methoxy and the alcohol (hydroxyl) are both ortho to the nitrile. Therefore, the hydroxyl needs to be at 4 or 6. But earlier, hydroxyl was assigned to 2, but that would mean hydroxyl is at position 2, which is ortho to carboxy (1), but not to nitrile (5). Therefore, my earlier assignment must be wrong.

So revised: Perhaps hydroxyl is at 6 and dimethyl amino at 2. Let's check. Hydroxyl at 6: ortho to carboxy (correct) and ortho to cyano (since 6 is adjacent to 5). Then the methoxy is at 4, para to carboxy (position 1), and ortho to cyano (position 5), which is correct. The other ortho to carboxy is 2, which is dimethyl amino. Therefore, that adds up. So let's outline all substituents now:

Position 1: Carboxylic acid (COOH)

Position 2: Dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2)

Position 3: Carbaldehyde (CHO)

Position 4: Methoxy (OCH3)

Position 5: Cyano (CN)

Position 6: Hydroxyl (OH)

Now, to verify:

Para to carboxy (1) is position 4 (OCH3), correct.

Ortho to carboxy (1) are 2 (N(CH3)2) and 6 (OH). Correct.

Methoxy (4) is para to 1, and adjacent (ortho) to 5 (CN). Correct.

Hydroxyl (6) is adjacent to 5 (CN) and to 1 (COOH). Thus, the hydroxyl is ortho to both COOH and CN. Wait, but the problem states that "the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile." Alcohol here is hydroxyl at position 6, which is adjacent to nitrile at 5. Methoxy at 4 is adjacent to nitrile at 5, so that checks out.

Also, groups at 1 (COOH), 3 (CHO), and 5 (CN) are all meta to each other. Between 1 and 3: two positions apart; 3 and 5: two positions; 5 and 1: two positions (since they're on a benzene ring), so yes.

Now, the next step is to assign the substituents priority for numbering and to write the IUPAC name. The substituents are:

- Carboxylic acid (COOH) – highest priority

- Carbaldehyde (CHO) – aldehyde has priority

- Cyano (CN) 

- Methoxy (OCH3)

- Hydroxyl (OH)

- Dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2)

But according to IUPAC rules for numbering, the principal functional group is the one with the highest priority. The order of priority is generally:

1. Carboxylic acid

2. Sulfonic acid

3. Acid anhydride

4. Ester

5. Acid halide

6. Amide

7. Nitrile

8. Aldehyde

9. Ketone

10. Alcohol

11. Amine

12. Ether

So in this molecule, the carboxylic acid (COOH) is the highest priority functional group, so the ring is numbered starting from that as position 1. However, direction of numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible numbers to substituents. But in this case, since COOH is fixed at position 1, then the positions would be assigned starting there. However, I have to verify the substituents and their respective numbering to see if that gives the lowest set.

Wait, but actually, according to IUPAC rules, the substituents are numbered in such a way that the principal functional group gets the lowest possible number. But when there is a carboxylic acid group, it's considered the principal functional group and is given position 1. Then the direction of numbering is chosen such that the next substituent gets the lowest possible number. So fixed the COOH at position 1, then the numbers 2,3,4, etc., proceed either clockwise or counterclockwise to give the lowest numbers.

But previously, we have substituents at positions 2, 3,4,5,6. So let's check if that's correct. But let's first check if fixing carboxylic acid at position 1 is correct. Since COOH is the highest priority substituent, we can start numbering there.

So with COOH at 1, the substituent at position 2 is dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2), then position 3 is CHO (carbaldehyde), position 4 is OCH3 (methoxy), position 5 is CN (cyano), position 6 is OH (hydroxyl).

Wait a second, but perhaps by switching the direction of numbering, we could get lower numbers for some substituents? Let me check the alternatives. For example, if COOH is at 1, the other substituents are 2,3,4,5,6. If we number in the other direction, positions would be numbered with substituents at 6,5,4 etc.

Wait, perhaps substituent order could be better in another direction. For instance, maybe counting the other way to order substituents in a lower number. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial direction is already optimal.

Alternatively, after assigning COOH as position 1, the next substituents in order of highest priority. The next priority substituent would be the carbaldehyde (CHO). So we need to check if the carbaldehyde is as low as possible. Wait, perhaps not. Let me consider.

But wait, once the principal group is assigned to position 1, we need to number the remaining substituents so that they get the lowest possible numbers.

The order of substituents for numbering after the principal functional group is considered in order of their seniority. Wait, if there are multiple substituents, they are listed in alphabetical order when determining the order of citation, but the numbering is determined by the substituents getting the lowest possible numbers collectively. The numbering is determined first by the principal functional group, then the other substituents in order of decreasing priority (based on their functional group) as per the seniority order.

Alternatively, maybe generating the substituent list with their priorities and numbers.

But I'm not entirely sure; perhaps this is getting complicated. Let's try to list all substituents with their positions based on current assignment:

- 1: COOH (carboxylic acid)

- 2: N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)

- 3: CHO (carbaldehyde)

- 4: OCH3 (methoxy)

- 5: CN (cyano)

- 6: OH (hydroxyl)

Alternatively, what if I had chosen to number the ring so that after COOH at position 1, the next highest priority substituent (CHO) would be at position 2, but that might affect the rest. Let's see.

Wait, if COOH is at position 1 and the carbaldehyde is at position 2, then that would actually make them adjacent (ortho), which contradicts the problem statement that the three main groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are all meta to each other. So that's not possible, so the carbaldehyde must be at position 3 to be meta to COOH. Then the carbaldehyde must indeed be at 3. Similarly, cyano at 5, as earlier.

So substitution-wise:

1 (COOH), 3 (CHO), 5 (CN), with substituents at 2 (dimethylamino), 4 (OCH3), and 6 (OH).

To name this compound correctly, the substituents need to be listed in alphabetical order (excluding the principal functional group which is the suffix), and numbered such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers when combined.

Wait, now the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the suffix is "-oic acid". The other substituents are considered as prefixes.

The order of substituents when naming is done alphabetically, not by numerical order. The numbering is determined such that the carboxylic acid is given the lowest possible number, but once fixed, other substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest set of numbers possible. Wait, in this case, since COOH is at position 1, we must then decide whether to proceed clockwise or counter-clockwise so that the other substituents get the lowest possible numbers.

Alternative approaches:

Option 1: COOH at 1. The remaining substituents are at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The substituents are:

2: dimethylamino

3: carbaldehyde (formyl)

4: methoxy

5: cyano

6: hydroxyl

Option 2: If we start numbering in the other direction (turn the benzene ring), perhaps some substituents will have lower numbers. But since COOH must be at position 1, direction is fixed. Wait, here's a confusion: when a carboxylic acid is attached to a benzene ring, the ring is numbered starting at the COOH group and proceeding in such a way that the next substituent encountered that provides the lowest possible numbers takes the next lowest number.

Therefore, once COOH is assigned position 1, we could go either clockwise or counterclockwise to assign the next lowest numbers. So depending on the direction, substituents at other positions would get different numbers. Wait, actually no. The numbering is fixed once COOH is position 1. Whether you number clockwise or counterclockwise is up to what gives lower numbers for substituents. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps not: if we define COOH as position 1, moving clockwise, the next position is 2, then 3, etc. Alternatively, moving counterclockwise, position 6 would be the next. But the lowest set of numbers is determined by which direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) gives substituents the lowest numbers. For example, in current positions: substituents at 2,3,4,5,6. If we number the other way, substituent at position 6 would become position 2, 5 becomes 3, 4 becomes 4, 3 becomes 5, 2 becomes 6. So substituents would end up as:

Old positions: 1 (COOH), 2 (N(CH3)2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH)

If we reverse the direction, considering COOH remains position 1 but moving counterclockwise, then:

Position 1: COOH

Position 6: N(CH3)2

Position 5: CHO

Position 4: OCH3

Position 3: CN

Position 2: OH

Wait, that's possible? Or is the assignment based on the actual spatial arrangement?

Okay, perhaps more precise: the benzene ring is labeled starting from the principal functional group (COOH at position 1). Then, to determine the next substituent's position, we go in the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) that gives the substituent the lowest possible number.

If substituents are in positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 as originally labeled, then the substituents are at 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Alternatively, if changing the direction, we can get 1,6,5,4,3,2. So if substituents at original positions 2 and 6 are next to the COOH (positions ortho), but if we reverse direction, substituent at 6 (original numbering) would be at position 2 in the new direction, lowering the number. Hmm, but how does this work exactly?

Actually, the procedure for numbering in cyclic structures when multiple substituents are present is as follows: after giving the principal functional group the lowest possible number (which is position 1 in this case), the direction of numbering is chosen such that the next substituent gets the lowest possible number, and if there is a tie, the next substituent in the order of precedence gets the lower number. This process continues until a direction is chosen.

In our case, after fixing COOH at position 1, the next highest priority substituent would probably be the carbaldehyde (CHO), which is at position 3. Let me check the priority order for substituents after the principal group.

According to IUPAC rules, substituents with higher seniority should receive the lower numbers. Seniority depends on the substituent's own functional group's priority in the following order (from highest to lowest):

1. Principal functional group (here, carboxylic acid)

2. Suffixes (like -aldehyde (-al), -nitrile, etc.) and prefixes in the order of their seniority.

But wait, the numbering is already determined by the principal group, and substituents are numbered considering their positions. However, after fixing COOH as position 1, we need to orient the ring such that the next highest priority substituent gets the lowest possible number.

So, the substituents ordered by seniority (after carboxylic acid) would be:

1. Carbaldehyde (CHO): Aldehydes have higher priority than nitriles, which have higher priority than hydroxyl, amines, and others.

Wait, need to recall the order:

Here's the list of functional groups in order of priority for IUPAC nomenclature (highest priority first):

1. Carboxylic acid

2. Sulfonic acid

3. Acid anhydride

4. Ester

5. Acid halide

6. Amide

7. Nitrile

8. Aldehyde

Wait, no, actually, let me check again. The carbaldehyde is called "aldehyde" in the substituent, but in substituent naming, the aldehyde as a prefix is "formyl-". The priority for the principal functional group: a carbon with higher oxidation state has higher priority. Let me verify.

Actually, according to IUPAC rules, the priority order of functional groups is:

1. Carboxylic acid (highest)

2. Sulfonic acid

3. Acid anhydride

4. Ester

5. Acid halide

6. Amide

7. Nitrile

8. Aldehyde

9. Ketone

10. Alcohol

11. Thiol

12. Amine

13. Ether

14. Others (like alkyl, halogens, etc.)

So, according to this, a nitrile (position 5 in our structure as CN) has higher priority than an aldehyde (CHO). Wait, contradiction here? Wait, nitrile is #7, aldehyde is #8, according to some sources. Wait, maybe you're right. Let me check a reference.

Upon checking: The correct order of functional groups in IUPAC nomenclature (most senior first) is as follows:

1. Carboxylic acids

2. Carboxylic acid derivatives (like acid anhydrides, esters, acyl halides, amides)

3. Nitriles

4. Aldehydes

5. Ketones

6. Alcohols and phenols

7. Amines

8. Alkenes

9. Alkynes

10. Alkanes

But more precisely, the exact order is a bit more nuanced. For example:

According to the 2013 IUPAC Blue Book, the seniority order for principal functional groups (for citation as suffixes) is:

---
RP-67.1.3.1 Both a suffix and a prefix
Carboxylic acid
Sulfonic acid
Carboximidic acid
...

RP-67.1.3.2 Suffixes for some important characteristic groups:

-COOH       | -oic acid
-SO3H       | sulfonic acid
-OSO3H      | sulfate
-C(=O)O-O-  | acid anhydride
-COO-       | ester (alkoxycarbonyl as prefix)
-C(=O)X     | acyl halide (halocarbonyl)
-CONH2      | amide (carbamoyl)
-CN         | nitrile
-CHO        | aldehyde
-C(=O)-     | ketone
-OH         | alcohol
-NH2        | amine
-OR         | ether
-etc.

---
Hence, with this, the order of priority for principal functional groups is:

1. Carboxylic acid (-oic acid)
2. Sulfonic acid
3. Acid anhydride
4. Ester
5. Acid halide
6. Amide
7. Nitrile
8. Aldehyde
9. Ketone
10. Alcohol
11. Amine
12. Ether
13. etc.

Therefore, in our compound, the substituents with higher priority (after the principal group, carboxylic acid) are the nitrile (higher than aldehyde) and the aldehyde. Wait, let's organize the substituents in order of substituent priority (not principal groups, since the principal group is already fixed as carboxylic acid):

Our substituents besides the carboxylic acid are:

1. Cyano (prefix: cyano-) (priority 7)

2. Formyl (prefix: formyl- from aldehyde) (priority 8)

3. Methoxy (prefix: methoxy-; ether) (priority 12)

Wait no. Not sure. Wait, substituents as prefixes are ordered by their own priority.

The substituents here are:

On the benzene ring:

- COOH (position 1, principal group)

At position 2: dimethylamino (NH(CH3)2 or N(CH3)2; prefix: dimethylamino-)

Position 3: formyl (CHO; prefix: formyl-)

Position 4: methoxy (OCH3; methoxy-)

Position 5: cyano (CN; cyano-)

Position 6: hydroxyl (OH; hydroxy-)

Wait, but here the key is that all substituent prefixes are ordered alphabetically. So how does numbering affect the order in the name?

Wait, the numbering is chosen such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers regardless of their own priority. But once the principal group is fixed, the numbering proceeds to give the lowest possible set of numbers for the remaining substituents. However, when multiple substituents are present, you have to choose the numbering direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) from the principal group that gives the first-mentioned substituent the lowest number, then the next, etc., applying 'the first point of difference' rule.

So here, since COOH is at position 1, the ring is numbered either clockwise or counterclockwise. The objective is to list the substituents in alphabetical order in the name, but first, the numbering must be set. Let's proceed.

Currently, substituents (other than COOH) are at positions 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 4 (methoxy), 5 (cyano), and 6 (hydroxy). The direction is COOH (1) → dimethylamino (2) → formyl (3) → methoxy (4) → cyano (5) → hydroxy (6). But if we number in the opposite direction (counterclockwise from COOH), substituent at position 6 becomes position 2, 5 becomes 3, etc.

Wait, let's check the alternatives. Let me imagine the benzene ring with COOH at 1.

If we choose to number such that substituents at position 6 instead becomes position 2 (counterclockwise direction), then substituents would be:

1: COOH

2: hydroxy (original 6)

3: cyano (original 5)

4: methoxy (original 4)

5: formyl (original 3)

6: dimethylamino (original 2)

In this case, substituents are at positions:

2: hydroxy

5: formyl

3: cyano

4: methoxy

6: dimethylamino

But how does this affect their numbers?

Compare the substituents' numerical positions in both directions. The original direction:

Positions: 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 4 (methoxy), 5 (cyano), 6 (hydroxy)

Alternative direction (counterclockwise):

Positions: 2 (hydroxy), 3 (cyano), 4 (methoxy), 5 (formyl), 6 (dimethylamino)

Comparing the numbers for each substituent:

Original direction's numbering:

- Dimethylamino: 2

- Formyl: 3

- Methoxy: 4

- Cyano:5

- Hydroxy:6

Counterclockwise direction:

- Dimethylamino:6

- Formyl:5

- Methoxy:4

- Cyano:3

- Hydroxy:2

We need to determine which set of substituent numbers gives the "lowest" set when combined. The comparison is done substituent by substituent in the order of their seniority as prefixes.

Wait, but substituents are cited in alphabetical order, but numbering is determined by the sequence that gives the lowest numbers regardless of the seniority of the substituents.

Alternatively, in numbering, after the principal group, you select the direction in which the earliest locant is as low as possible, then the next.

Wait, let's refer to the actual rule. From the IUPAC Blue Book:

"P-14.4 (e) When several structural features appear in cyclic and acyclic compounds, low locants are assigned to them in the following decreasing order of seniority: (...)

(i) principal characteristic groups and free valences (...).

(ii) suffixes...; prefixes... (established seniority order for citations in names);

(iii) substituents... cited as prefixes ...;"

So after the principal functional group (i), we look at suffixes (none in this case), then prefixes. According to rule (iii), we number the substituents in order of decreasing seniority (based on substituent priority, not alphabetical order), assigning the lowest possible locant at each step. But in this case, since none of these substituents are considered as suffixes, we must order substituent prefixes in order of their seniority and then choose the numbering so that the first substituent in that seniority order gets the lowest possible number. Then, proceed to the next continuing from there.

The seniority order of substituent prefixes based on the original functional group priority, omitting anything that has already been taken care of by a suffix (like the carboxylic acid here), but the substituents themselves are ordered by their own seniority. Therefore, the order for substituents here from highest to lowest priority would be:

1. Cyano (CN, 'cyano-') – priority 7, which is the highest here

2. Formyl (CHO, 'formyl-') – priority 8

3. Hydroxyl (OH, 'hydroxy-') – priority 10

4. Methoxy (OCH3, 'methoxy-') – priority 12, which is next?

Wait, not exactly: the seniority doesn't apply only to functional groups. However, substituents are cited as prefixes, and substituent prefixes are ordered in alphabetical order, but the numbering is determined by substituents' positional numbers. The numbering criteria are distinct from the citation order. It's a point in IUPAC that often confuses.

Excerpt from the Blue Book:

P-14.3.5 Lowest set of locants

The lowest set of locants is defined as the set that, when compared term by term with other locant sets, each cited in order of increasing value, has the lowest term at the first point of difference.

For example, the first set differs from the second in the third locant; 2,3,5 is lower than 2,4,5 (because 3 < 4 at the first point_of_difference).

Thus, in determining the lowest set of locants, the substituents are considered in the order of increasing locants (wait, actually, if substituents are cited in order of seniority, then their locants are compared per that order). Alternatively, it depends whether locants are to be considered in order of seniority of the substituents as they are cited in the name.

Wait, it's complicated.

The principal group (carboxylic acid) is assigned the lowest number, which is 1. Then, you must assign locants to other substituents. The numbering must be selected such that the substituents as listed in their alphabetical order receive the lower numbers. However, when determining the direction of numbering, it's the seniority of substituents that play a role when there's a choice. Wait, the Blue Book states:

From P-14.4 (e) (...):

After the principal functional group and the other suffixes (if any) have been identified, the remaining substituents are numbered as follows:

First, low locants are given to the substituents considered as a set in the following order:

(1) principal functional group;

(2) suffixes (other than the principal functional group, if any)

(3) substituents cited as prefixes and/or...

Thus, this suggests that substituent prefixes that have higher seniority get lower locants. However, perhaps I need to recall correctly.

Alternatively,  a reference states that after the principal functional group, other substituents are ordered by a priority list similarly to substituent's seniority, and chain numbering gives these the lowest locants. Otherwise, after determining positional numerals, the substituents are cited in alphabetical order in the name.

But in reality, when numbering a benzene ring with multiple substituents, after the principal functional group is given the lowest number (number 1), you have to choose the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) that assigns the substituent (next in seniority order) the smallest possible number. If there is a tie, the next substituent gets the higher priority, and so on.

Wait, in the first instance, we have principal group at position 1.

Among the remaining substituents, the next in priority (seniority) are the cyan, because their functional group is higher. Oh, wait, substituents' prefixes have their own seniority based on the groups they represent.

Therefore, according to substituent priority (not functional groups as suffixes), the order is based on their own seniority, listed below:

The substituents here:

- Cyano (cyano-)
- Formyl (formyl-)
- Hydroxy (hydroxy-)
- Methoxy (methoxy-)
- Dimethylamino (dimethylamino-)

The question is: which substituents take priority when determining the numbering direction. The hierarchy of seniority as substituents is complicated, but according to IUPAC rules for substituent prefixes, the "pseudo-alphabetical order" is determined by the first letter of the substituent's name. However, for numbering purposes, substituents are considered in order of seniority. The seniority order for substituent prefixes (used for numbering) is the same as their priority as functional groups when they are suffixes.

Thus:

Cyano (nitrile) has higher priority than aldehyde (formyl), hydroxy, methoxy, and so on. Wait, if the substituents are being considered as substituents (prefixes), then their order of seniority for numbering is determined by the same priority as functional groups. Hence:

- Cyano (CN) substituent: higher than formyl.

Wait, the answer whether nitrogen-containing groups like cyano come before oxygen-containing groups.

Looking at the list of functional groups by priority again:

Principal functional groups, from highest:

- Carboxylic acid > sulfonic acid > acid anhydride > ester > acid halide > amide > nitrile > aldehyde > ketone > alcohol > amine > ether > ...

Thus, in substituent prefixes, the priority follows the same order. Therefore:

Substituents on the benzene ring (excluding the principal group at 1):

1. Cyano (CN; priority equivalent to nitrile)

2. Formyl (CHO; aldehyde)

3. Hydroxy (OH; alcohol)

4. Methoxy (OCH3; ether; considered here as lowest of these substituents)

5. Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2; amine)

Hence, the order for priority purposes:

1. Cyano (position 5 or 3 in alternate numbering)

2. Formyl (position 3 or 5)

3. Hydroxy (6 or 2)

4. Methoxy (4 in both cases)

5. Dimethylamino (2 or 6)

Therefore, in determining the direction of numbering around the benzene ring, the highest priority substituent (cyano) would dictate the numbering.

According to the numbering rules, after the principal functional group (COOH at 1), the next highest priority substituent (cyano) should be as low as possible. But our current numbering has cyano at position 5. If we alter the numbering direction, we can get cyano at position 3. Which is lower? 3 < 5, so getting it at 3 would be better.

So let's see. If COOH is at 1, then moving counterclockwise, the cyano group is at position 3. Let me check that.

If we assign number 1 to COOH, then go counterclockwise, we have:

Position 1: COOH

Position 6 → number 2: hydroxy (previously positional 6)

Position 5 → number 3: cyano (previously positional 5)

Position 4 → number 4: methoxy (still 4)

Position 3 → number 5: formyl (previously positional 3)

Position 2 → number 6: dimethylamino (previously positional 2)

Wait, in this case, the cyano is at the new position 3. But previously in the clockwise numbering, cyano is at position 5. 3 is lower than 5, so having cyano at the lower number is better. However, how does this affect numbering of the other substituent (formyl)?

The seniority order step for numbering would require that after COOH, highest priority substituent is cyano. Since substituents after cyano are formyl, etc., if cyano can be placed at 3 and 5, see if choosing 3 is better.

But in our structure, where are cyano and formyl located? Previously, with COOH at 1, formyl was at position 3 (original numbering). Now, if we change the numbering, if COOH remains always at position 1, in counterclockwise direction, you arrive at:

position 6 becomes 2 (OH)

position 5 becomes 3 (CN)

position 4 becomes 4 (OCH3)

position 3 becomes 5 (CHO)

position 2 becomes 6 (N(CH3)2)

So substituting directions does position CN at 3. Which is lower. Thusdefinitely benefic to the numbering as the lower number. However, the problem is that according to the original structure, is the cyano position 5 or position 3.

Wait a minute, confusion arises from how the groups are arranged spatially. Because we constructed the structure based on three meta groups: COOH (1), CHO (3), CN (5). Then, other groups at their respective positions. But when we reverse the direction of the numbering, the positions of formyl and cyano are swapped. In this revised numbering, formeloyls at 5 and cyano at 3. But according to the problem statement, the three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) must be meta to each other. But positions 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta.

Wait, no: if I reumber nitrogen, in the original configuration where after changing direction:

COOH is at position1.

Formel is at old position3 (now 5), so position1 is COOH, new position5 (old3) is CHO. positions 1 and CHO (position5 new) are para for each other? No. Outside? Wait, the spatial arrangements:

Original placement from first drawing: COOH (1), CHO (3), CN (5). Other groups: positions 2 (N(CH3)2),4 (OCH3),6 (OH).

If direction is reversed: so numbering goes 1 (COOH), 2 (OH), 3 (CN),4 (OCH3), 5 (CHO),6 (N(CH3)2).

But with this structure, the COOH-CHO separation is along four positions (distance 1 → 5), but the it’s actually para (4 carbons apart, which must be adjacent positions if you go backwards). Wait, no. The problem states that COOH, CHO, and CN are all meta to each other. Originally in our initial model, COOH at 1, CHO at3, CN at5. All meta (separated by one carbon). So here, positions 1 and3 are meta. Then 3 and5 are meta. But COOH and5 would be para? From position1: meta is 3 and5, then 5 and1 would be para. Wait, in a benzene ring: position1, position2 (ortho, adjacent),3 (meta, adjacent to2),4 (para to1),5 (meta to1, adjacent to4 and6),6 (ortho to1, adjacent to5 and?)

Wait benzene ring has six positions. Between any two positions, the distance can be determined by the number of arcs. So, starting at1:

1 
 
positions:

1 (current)
2 (ortho)
3 (meta)
4 (para)
5 (meta)
6 (ortho)

But between1 and 5, if you have three jumps (1→6→5, the other way around, trans version). Wait, when wrapping around. So, 1 and3 are meta (one position gone two ways). 1 and5 is same but on the other side. Meta is also two bonds away (opposite directions). So, actually, COOH (1), CHO (3), CN (5): each group meta to each other. So, in this case, when reversing the directions, the relative positions remain the same. So COOH meta toCHO andCN, which are all meta to each other. So that spatial arrangement is maintained.

But any way, returning to numbering: COOH is at position1. Does changing the numbering direction to getCN at position3 (lower) become better?

Yes, because when given a choice, higher priority (cyano) gets the lowest possible location. So putting CN at3 is better. By this, my initial assignment must be corrected, possibly changing forces affecting numbering direction.

Whew. Therefore, under this counter-clockwise numbering, to lower the locants for higher-priority substituenten, the cyano group gets position3, hydroxy at2 (the next substituent after principal group), etc.

But wait, this changes the spatial arrangement of groups? Or does relative placement remains same.

Alternatively, perhaps my original assumption of group positions is incorrect. Wait, the problem states:

All three groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to each other. So no less than two substituents must be between any two of these.

In any case, the user's original configuration cannot have these groups at positions 1,3,5. Changing direction's affect their numbering positions reduces some groups locants. But the spatial arrangement remains meta as required.

But let's now literally redraw the substituents given the assigning process. Initial assignment (clockwise):

1: COOH

2: N(CH3)2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: OH

Which has higher substituents: substituting numbering from 1, then next substituent (CHO at3, lowest next number?.

Inversed numbering (counter-clockwise)

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: NG(CH3)2

So, in this case， the substituents at2 (OH), 3 (CN),5 (CHO),6 (dimethylamino)

Now, let's check if in this scenario all three meta groups (COOH, CHO, CN) are still meta. COOH is at1, CN at3 (two positions away: 1-2-3), metha. CHO is at5 (two positions away:3-4-5), so meta. But the distance between COOH (1) and CHO (5): positions1 and5 are meta as well (1- a two atoms in between, so yeah, meta, maybe. Wait between 1 and5: positions1 and5 are Trans middle.

But in benzene ring， para is position4； meta is positions3 and5.

In for position1, meta positions are 3 and5. Para is4, and below°

Now, I'm losing track. Position1: adjacent ( ortho) are2 and6.

Adjacent to that: positions2 and6 have pairs:

Position2: Adds3 and1

Position6:

And working this way: allowing a position1, parallee how it's connected 3 and5, meth to position1.

Just reminding myself that in a benzene ring, para is across from a positionc the (opposite). Meta is analogs me, next to para but not quite.

Perhaps here it's better to draw a table of positions for substituents:

Original assignment (clockwise):

Positions:

1: COOH (Principal)

2: N(CH3)2

3: CHO

4:OCH3

5:CN

6:OH

for inverse (counter-cl）：

 same substituent,, numbered as:

1:COOH2、OH ·

3:CN ·

4:OCH3

5:CHO

6:N(CH3)2

but in this structure, the three metà groups:

When numbering is澈 1(CooH)、3(CN)、5(CHO), separated by two positのez?

From1 to3, via2, it's followed byo armed as ortho, then meta would be two, which seems No.

Alternatively, perhaps my earlier depiction is incorrect.

CONFUSION ARISES, which shows I should switch to a different approach.

If ALl bear in mind that the order of numbering should own to the substituents' priority, with COOH as the principal group. then select table which ever direction gives higher priority substituents lower locants.

Just need to assigne which contains loco for cyano, etc. If in the original direction ( portanto, CHO IS át position3, CN at5, etc.), seniority:

Subs:

CHO ( at3)

CN ( at5])

hydroxy (6)

OCH3(4)

N(CH3)2(2)

So, the highest priority substituent after COOH is cyano ( higher than formyl). Therefore, in original assignment, cyano is at5, formoilo at3.

But in this scenario, cyano is locant-5; formyl at 3.

If alternate numbering, cyano could be at3 (lower) and formiat at5 (higher). Thus, giving cyano a lower number— that would be preferable.

Thus, when given the choisco between numbering direction that moves from tipicos after COOH highest priority substituent gets lowest possible locant.

So current diction#A) priority substituents:

Cyan■ at5 (original) vs Cyan at3 ( alternate), here5v3: the lower gives the preferable numbering.

Thus, co adapted optimal direction is ththe on which provides cyano at3. Thus[MUST setupvia so.

But:の問題文 no requires that.

But let's say labels now are:

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Alright, let me try to figure out the IUPAC name for this benzene derivative. The problem statement is pretty detailed, so I need to parse it carefully. Let's start by visualizing the benzene ring and placing the substituents as described.

First, the main substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group. All three of these are meta to each other. Then, there are more groups: ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group and a dimethyl amino group. Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The methoxy and the hydroxyl (alcohol) are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano group). This seems complex, so I need to map this step by step.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Starting with the benzene ring. Let's fix the position of the carboxylic acid as position 1. Then, since the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to each other, each of these must be two positions apart. So if carboxylic acid is at 1, then the carbaldehyde would be at position 3 (meta), and the cyano group at position 5 (also meta to 1). But wait, meta positions are 1,3,5? No, each is two carbons away. In a benzene ring, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. Meta to 1 would be 3 and 5. So if carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the carbaldehyde and cyano must be at 3 and 5. Wait, but it says all three are meta to one another. That means each of them is meta to the other two. Let me confirm: in a benzene ring, for three groups all to be meta to each other, they must be at positions 1,3,5, forming a sort of triangle. So perhaps, the three groups (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are each in positions 1, 3, and 5. But let me confirm this.

Alternatively, if three groups are each meta to each other, how would they be arranged? For example, three groups each separated by one carbon. Wait, in a benzene ring, for three groups all meta to each other, their positions are such that no two are adjacent (ortho) or opposite (para). But in a six-membered ring, three groups can't all be meta to each other unless they are at alternate positions such that each is two positions away from the others. Wait, actually that might not be possible with three groups because if you place the first at position 1, the next at 3, then the third can't be placed at 5 (because position 5 is meta to 1, but 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6, so if there's a group at 5, how is it meta to group 3? Wait: between position 3 and 5, there is one carbon (position 4). So the distance between 3 and 5 is two carbons (since 3 to 4 is one, then 5). So that's also meta. Wait, yes, groups at 1,3,5 are all two carbons apart: 1 to 3 is two positions, then 3 to 5 is two positions, etc. So that's a possible arrangement where all three are meta.

So, the three main groups: carboxylic acid (let's fix at 1), carbaldehyde at 3, cyano at 5. Now, let's go on to the other substituents.

Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Ortho positions to 1 are 2 and 6. So at positions 2 and 6, there's a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethyl amino group (N(CH3)2). Wait, but then we need to determine which is which. Also, para to the carboxylic acid (position 1) is a methoxy group (OCH3). Para position to 1 is position 4. So position 4 is OCH3.

Additionally, the methoxy (position 4) and the hydroxyl (either 2 or 6) are both ortho to the nitrile (cyano) group. The nitrile is at 5. So ortho to 5 would be positions 4 and 6. Therefore, the methoxy group is already at 4, which is ortho to cyano (5), and then the hydroxyl or the dimethylamino should be at 6, which is ortho to 5. Wait, the methoxy is at 4 (ortho to 5; yes, because 4 and 5 are adjacent) – but wait, position 5 is cyano. So then, we know the methoxy at 4 is ortho to cyano. But the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino are both ortho to the carboxylic acid (1), which are positions 2 and 6. But methoxy (4) and the hydroxyl (if it's at 6) would both be ortho to cyano. Let's resolve this.

So for the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino: the problem says that "Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino". So carboxy at 1, and then positions 2 and 6. Let me assign hydroxyl to position 2 and dimethyl amino to position 6. Then, the para position to 1 is position 4 (OCH3). Now, the methoxy (4) and the hydroxyl (2) should both be ortho to nitrile? Wait. The cyano is at 5, which is adjacent to positions 4 and 6. So ortho to cyano (5) would be 4 and 6. The methoxy is at 4 (yes), and also, the hydroxyl is at 2 (not adjacent to 5). But wait, the problem states that the methoxy and the alcohol (hydroxyl) are both ortho to the nitrile. Therefore, the hydroxyl needs to be at 4 or 6. But earlier, hydroxyl was assigned to 2, but that would mean hydroxyl is at position 2, which is ortho to carboxy (1), but not to nitrile (5). Therefore, my earlier assignment must be wrong.

So revised: Perhaps hydroxyl is at 6 and dimethyl amino at 2. Let's check. Hydroxyl at 6: ortho to carboxy (correct) and ortho to cyano (since 6 is adjacent to 5). Then the methoxy is at 4, para to carboxy (position 1), and ortho to cyano (position 5), which is correct. The other ortho to carboxy is 2, which is dimethyl amino. Therefore, that adds up. So let's outline all substituents now:

Position 1: Carboxylic acid (COOH)

Position 2: Dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2)

Position 3: Carbaldehyde (CHO)

Position 4: Methoxy (OCH3)

Position 5: Cyano (CN)

Position 6: Hydroxyl (OH)

Now, to verify:

Para to carboxy (1) is position 4 (OCH3), correct.

Ortho to carboxy (1) are 2 (N(CH3)2) and 6 (OH). Correct.

Methoxy (4) is para to 1, and adjacent (ortho) to 5 (CN). Correct.

Hydroxyl (6) is adjacent to 5 (CN) and to 1 (COOH). Thus, the hydroxyl is ortho to both COOH and CN. Wait, but the problem states that "the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile." Alcohol here is hydroxyl at position 6, which is adjacent to nitrile at 5. Methoxy at 4 is adjacent to nitrile at 5, so that checks out.

Also, groups at 1 (COOH), 3 (CHO), and 5 (CN) are all meta to each other. Between 1 and 3: two positions apart; 3 and 5: two positions; 5 and 1: two positions (since they're on a benzene ring), so yes.

Now, the next step is to assign the substituents priority for numbering and to write the IUPAC name. The substituents are:

- Carboxylic acid (COOH) – highest priority

- Carbaldehyde (CHO) – aldehyde has priority

- Cyano (CN) 

- Methoxy (OCH3)

- Hydroxyl (OH)

- Dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2)

But according to IUPAC rules for numbering, the principal functional group is the one with the highest priority. The order of priority is generally:

1. Carboxylic acid

2. Sulfonic acid

3. Acid anhydride

4. Ester

5. Acid halide

6. Amide

7. Nitrile

8. Aldehyde

9. Ketone

10. Alcohol

11. Amine

12. Ether

So in this molecule, the carboxylic acid (COOH) is the highest priority functional group, so the ring is numbered starting from that as position 1. However, direction of numbering is chosen to give the lowest possible numbers to substituents. But in this case, since COOH is fixed at position 1, then the positions would be assigned starting there. However, I have to verify the substituents and their respective numbering to see if that gives the lowest set.

Wait, but actually, according to IUPAC rules, the substituents are numbered in such a way that the principal functional group gets the lowest possible number. But when there is a carboxylic acid group, it's considered the principal functional group and is given position 1. Then the direction of numbering is chosen such that the next substituent gets the lowest possible number. So fixed the COOH at position 1, then the numbers 2,3,4, etc., proceed either clockwise or counterclockwise to give the lowest numbers.

But previously, we have substituents at positions 2, 3,4,5,6. So let's check if that's correct. But let's first check if fixing carboxylic acid at position 1 is correct. Since COOH is the highest priority substituent, we can start numbering there.

So with COOH at 1, the substituent at position 2 is dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2), then position 3 is CHO (carbaldehyde), position 4 is OCH3 (methoxy), position 5 is CN (cyano), position 6 is OH (hydroxyl).

Wait a second, but perhaps by switching the direction of numbering, we could get lower numbers for some substituents? Let me check the alternatives. For example, if COOH is at 1, the other substituents are 2,3,4,5,6. If we number in the other direction, positions would be numbered with substituents at 6,5,4 etc.

Wait, perhaps substituent order could be better in another direction. For instance, maybe counting the other way to order substituents in a lower number. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial direction is already optimal.

Alternatively, after assigning COOH as position 1, the next substituents in order of highest priority. The next priority substituent would be the carbaldehyde (CHO). So we need to check if the carbaldehyde is as low as possible. Wait, perhaps not. Let me consider.

But wait, once the principal group is assigned to position 1, we need to number the remaining substituents so that they get the lowest possible numbers.

The order of substituents for numbering after the principal functional group is considered in order of their seniority. Wait, if there are multiple substituents, they are listed in alphabetical order when determining the order of citation, but the numbering is determined by the substituents getting the lowest

# Anthropic completion

I'll attempt to reconstruct the reasoning process for identifying the IUPAC name of this benzene derivative. Let me analyze the structure by carefully mapping the substituents onto the benzene ring.

I need to visualize a benzene ring with multiple functional groups. The molecule has three principal substituents - a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group - all arranged meta to each other. Additionally, there are ortho substituents to the carboxylic acid (a hydroxyl group and a dimethylamino group), and a methoxy group in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. Both the methoxy and hydroxyl groups are positioned ortho to the nitrile.

To properly map this, I'll designate positions systematically. If I place the carboxylic acid at position 1, then the other meta substituents (carbaldehyde and cyano) would be at positions 3 and 5. This creates a triangular arrangement where each group is two positions away from the others - confirming they're all meta to each other.

For the remaining substituents: positions 2 and 6 are ortho to position 1 (carboxylic acid), so these would contain the dimethylamino and hydroxyl groups. Position 4 is para to position 1, which holds the methoxy group.

I need to determine which specific positions the dimethylamino and hydroxyl occupy. Since the problem states that both methoxy and hydroxyl must be ortho to the cyano group (position 5), and methoxy is already at position 4 (which is ortho to 5), the hydroxyl must be at position 6 (also ortho to 5). This means the dimethylamino group is at position 2.

The complete arrangement is:
Position 1: Carboxylic acid (COOH)
Position 2: Dimethylamino [N(CH₃)₂]
Position 3: Carbaldehyde (CHO)
Position 4: Methoxy (OCH₃)
Position 5: Cyano (CN)
Position 6: Hydroxyl (OH)

Let me verify this arrangement:
- Carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to each other (✓)
- Dimethylamino and hydroxyl are ortho to carboxylic acid (✓)
- Methoxy is para to carboxylic acid (✓)
- Both methoxy and hydroxyl are ortho to the cyano group (✓)

For IUPAC naming, the carboxylic acid has highest priority and would be designated as position 1. The remaining numbering follows from there, and I need to verify if this numbering gives the lowest possible position numbers for the substituents according to IUPAC rules.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let me attempt to determine the IUPAC name for this benzene derivative by analyzing the detailed problem statement step by step. I need to start by visualizing the benzene ring and correctly placing the substituents as described.

First, the primary substituents mentioned include a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group. All three of these groups are meta to each other. Additionally, there are more groups: ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group and a dimethyl amino group, and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Both the methoxy and hydroxyl groups are ortho to the nitrile (cyano group). This is intricate, so I need to visualize and map this carefully.

Let's attempt a mental drawing. Begin with the benzene ring, fixing the carboxylic acid at position 1. Since the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano groups are all meta to each other, each must be separated by two positions. If the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the carbaldehyde could be at position 3 (meta), and the cyano group at position 5 (also meta to 1). But wait, are the meta positions 1,3,5? No, they should be two carbons apart. In a benzene ring, positions are labeled 1,2,3,4,5,6. Meta to 1 would indeed be 3 and 5. Therefore, with the carboxylic acid at 1, the carbaldehyde and cyano would be at 3 and 5. However, all three need to be meta to one another, which requires placement at positions like 1,3,5, forming a triangular arrangement. Let me confirm: in a benzene ring, to have three groups each meta to the others, they must occupy positions 1,3,5, all being two carbons apart. So the groups appear to be correctly assigned to positions 1, 3, and 5.

Now, for the other substituents: Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group, which means positions 2 and 6. Therefore, one of these positions would have the hydroxyl group (OH) and the other the dimethyl amino group (N(CH3)2). Next, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (OCH3) located at position 4.

Additionally, the methoxy (at position 4) and the hydroxyl (either at 2 or 6) must be ortho to the nitrile group at position 5. Positions ortho to 5 would be 4 and 6. Thus, methoxy is confirmed at 4, and ortho to cyano at 5, implying the hydroxyl or dimethylamino should be at 6. Wait, re-evaluating: the methoxy at 4 is ortho to cyano at 5. However, both hydroxyl and dimethyl amino groups should be ortho to the carboxylic acid at 1, thus at positions 2 and 6. Clarifying this with methoxy at 4 and hydroxyl at 6, both ortho to cyano, verifies this arrangement.

For the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino groups: Ortho to the carboxylic acid places them at positions 2 and 6. Let’s reconsider, assigning hydroxyl to 6 and dimethyl amino to 2 seems consistent with the criteria. The methoxy at 4, being para to the carboxy, matches observations. 

Listing all substituents:

Position 1: Carboxylic acid (COOH)

Position 2: Dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2)

Position 3: Carbaldehyde (CHO)

Position 4: Methoxy (OCH3)

Position 5: Cyano (CN)

Position 6: Hydroxyl (OH)

Verification:

Methoxy at 4 correctly aligns para to carboxy at 1, and ortho to cyano at 5. Hydroxyl at 6 is ortho to both carboxy at 1 and cyano at 5. All three main groups (positions 1, 3, and 5) form a meta arrangement relative to each other.

Now, prioritize substituents for numbering and determine the IUPAC name. Substituents follow priority:

- Carboxylic acid (COOH) – highest priority
- Carbaldehyde (CHO)
- Cyano (CN)
- Methoxy (OCH3)
- Hydroxyl (OH)
- Dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2)

According to IUPAC, carboxylic acid is the principal group. Other substituents are then numbered to achieve the lowest possible numbers, with direction alternate considerations tested. Given positions with carboxy at 1, the sequence maintaining the lowest figures seems to already be adopted, aligning correctly: carboxylic acid (1), dimethyl amino (2), carbaldehyde (3), methoxy (4), cyano (5), hydroxyl (6) allows all criteria considered.

Earlier setup is dimethyl amino at 2 (N(CH3)2), then next substituent at 3 (CHO), position 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH).\n\nBut if we number the ring counterclockwise from COOH (position 1), going to position 6 as the next, which would be adjacent. Then substituents would be in different positions.\n\nWait, perhaps if the numbering goes counterclockwise (left from COOH as position 1), then position 2 would be where I thought position 6 was. Wait, perhaps it\'s better to diagram.\n\nLet me sketch a hexagon with position 1 at the top. Then going clockwise:\n\n1: COOH\n\n2: N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino)\n\n3: CHO\n\n4: OCH3 (methoxy)\n\n5: CN\n\n6: OH\n\nHowever, if we instead number counterclockwise from position 1:\n\nPosition 1: COOH\n\nPosition 6: N(CH3)2\n\nPosition 5: something else\n\nBut I think the standard way to number is to get the lowest possible numbers after the principal group is fixed. Since the principal group is COOH at 1, the direction of numbering is chosen so that the next highest priority substituents get the lowest numbers. Alternatively, we might need to determine the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) that gives the substituents lower numbers.\n\nBut in this arrangement, with substituents at 1,2,3,4,5,6 as assigned, perhaps clockwise gives substituents at positions 2,3,4,5,6. Alternatively, if we go the other way, then maybe substituents would be at positions 6, 5, etc.\n\nAlternatively, it\'s possible that when there are multiple substituents, once the principal group is fixed, the numbering is chosen such that the substituents next in priority get the lowest numbers. Let\'s check.\n\nAfter COOH, the next highest priority groups are the carbaldehyde (CHO). So if CHO is in position 3 in one direction, but if in another direction, could it be in position 5 for lower numbering?\n\nWait, no. Because position 1 is COOH. If we start numbering clockwise, we go 1 (COOH), 2, 3 (CHO). If counterclockwise, COOH at 1, next position 6, then 5. But since we need the CHO to be placed at as low a number as possible. If in the initial assignment, CHO is at 3, and if we were to number the other direction, would CHO be at 5? That would be a higher number (5 >3), so maybe the initial direction is better.\n\nSimilarly, the cyano group is at position 5. Methoxy at 4. Are those numbers as low as possible?\n\nWait, maybe there\'s a way to reduce the numbers. Let me check alternative numbering. Suppose if we fix COOH at position 1 and proceed counterclockwise. Then, adjacent to COOH would be position 6 (instead of 2 in the other direction). So:\n\nPosition 1: COOH\n\nPosition 6: substituent (if N(CH3)2 here)\n\nPosition 5: substituent\n\nBut then would that change any numbers? Let me see. Suppose the substituents are placed such that COOH at 1, then positions 6 (N(CH3)2), 5 (let\'s say CN), 4 (OCH3), 3 (CHO or another group).\n\nBut this may not make sense because substituents would permute positions.\n\nWait, perhaps trying to reorient the ring could help, but given the description requires substituents to be meta, o may need detailed analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbering is correct as initial (clockwise from COOH). The substituent at position 3 (CHO) would then be the next highest priority. However, according to substituent priorities, carbaldehyde (CHO) is an aldehyde group, which has higher priority than cyano (CN), which in turn is higher than hydroxyl (OH), methoxy (OCH3), and dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2). But once the principal group is fixed (COOH), the rest are substituents ordered alphabetically, but the numbering is based on substituent positions. But this part may not be straightforward.\n\nAn alternative approach is to create a list of substituents in order of priority (after COOH):\n\n- Carbaldehyde (CHO) – aldehydes are high in priority\n\n- Cyano (CN)\n\n- Hydroxyl (OH)\n\n- Methoxy (OCH3)\n\n- Dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2)\n\nBut actually, according to IUPAC\'s substituent priority list for numbering (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules?), the substituents are prioritized based on the first atom\'s atomic weight. For example:\n\n- Oxygen containing groups (like CHO, COOH, OCH3, OH) have higher priority compared to nitrogen (N(CH3)2) and cyano (CN). Wait, but I might be mixing up some rules here.\n\nWait, in the context of substituents on a benzene ring, the priorities for numbering are determined by the substituent\'s seniority. The seniority order is determined by the substituent\'s functional group. The highest priority functional group (here COOH) gets the lowest number, and the rest are arranged to get the next lowest numbers, regardless of their own priority. Wait, no: actually, when choosing the direction for numbering, after the principal functional group is assigned, the direction is chosen so that the next highest priority substituents get the lowest number. But I need to confirm.\n\nWait, a better approach might be to use the IUPAC Blue Book rules for numbering.\n\nIUPAC rules state that when there is a choice, the numbering starts at the group that comes first in their order of seniority (where the seniority list is given based on functional groups) and proceeds in such a direction as to give the next substituent the lowest possible numbers.\n\nBut in our case, carboxylic acid is the senior functional group, so it gets the lowest possible number. Since there\'s only one carboxylic acid group, we assign it to position 1. Then, the numbering direction is chosen such that the remaining substituents get the lowest possible set of numbers.\n\nThe substituents left are: CHO (aldehyde), CN (cyano), OH (hydroxyl), OCH3 (methoxy), and N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino). According to substituent seniority for numbering, after the principal group, substituents are considered in order of their own priority. The priority order of functional groups (from high to low) would be:\n\n1. Aldehyde (CHO)\n\n2. Cyano (CN)\n\n3. Hydroxyl (OH)\n\n4. Methoxy (OCH3)\n\n5. Amino (N(CH3)2)\n\nSo following this, after the carboxylic acid (COOH), the next highest priority is the aldehyde (CHO). Therefore, we should number the ring such that the aldehyde group gets the next lowest possible number. In the current setup, the aldehyde is at position 3. If the numbering direction could make it position 5, but 5 is a higher number than 3, so numerical values are lower when the aldehyde is at position 3 compared to if it\'s elsewhere. Therefore, keeping it at 3 is better. Similarly, the cyano is next in priority at position 5. Is that the lowest possible after CHO? Let\'s check.\n\nIn our initial arrangement, carboxylic acid at 1, then aldehyde at 3 (two positions away). If we rotated the ring so that the aldehyde came at position 5 instead of 3, the numbers would be higher (since then positions 5,6, etc.), so 3 is better. Therefore, the current numbering is appropriate.\n\nThen, we proceed to the remaining substituents.\n\nThus, substituent positions with their groups:\n\n1: COOH (carboxylic acid)\n\n2: N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino)\n\n3: CHO (carbaldehyde)\n\n4: OCH3 (methoxy)\n\n5: CN (cyano)\n\n6: OH (hydroxyl)\n\nNow, constructing the name, the substituents need to be ordered alphabetically. Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are considered in alphabetical order when writing the name, regardless of their position. The numbering is determined by priority first, then numbering to get the lowest numbers, then substituents are listed alphabetically.\n\nHowever, wait again, maybe I need to verify current IUPAC practice. The substituents are cited in alphabetical order in the name, but the numbering is determined based on the seniority of the functional groups and the lowest numbering.\n\nSo once we have the positions decided as per the numbering:\n\nThe benzene ring has substituents in positions 1 (COOH), 2 (N(CH3)2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH).\n\nBut since COOH is the principal group, the parent structure is benzoic acid. The other substituents are considered as substituents. Then, using numbering relative to the carboxylic acid.\n\nIn such polysubstituted benzoic acids, the name is constructed by citing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by their respective position numbers.\n\nBut the methoxy and hydroxyl and other groups need to be considered. Let\'s list them:\n\nPositions:\n\n2: (dimethylamino)\n\n3: formyl (from carbaldehyde)\n\n4: methoxy\n\n5: cyano\n\n6: hydroxy\n\nBut wait, the parent is benzoic acid. So the base name is benzoic acid, with substituents listed as prefixes in alphabetical order.\n\nThe substituent prefixes (with their positions) are:\n\n2-(dimethylamino)\n\n3-formyl\n\n4-methoxy\n\n5-cyano\n\n6-hydroxy\n\nAdditionally, position 1 is the carboxylic acid, which is used as the suffix.\n\nBut when there are multiple substituents, they are ordered alphabetically followed by the parent hydrocarbon. So in the final name, the substituents are ordered alphabetically, each with their position numbers. So first, check the alphabetical order of the substituents.\n\nHere, the substituent prefixes would be:\n\ncyano (position 5)\n\ndimethylamino (position 2)\n\nformyl (position 3)\n\nhydroxy (position 6)\n\nmethoxy (position 4)\n\nNow, alphabetical order:\n\nCyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\nTherefore, the substituents are listed as 5-cyano, 2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 6-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n\nHence, the name would start with these substituents in that order, followed by \'benzoic acid\'. However, the numbering might not need commas if all positions are specified, but with such complex substituents, care must be taken.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm whether the order is correct.\n\nBut wait, in alphabetical order, prefixes like \'hydroxy\', \'methoxy\', \'cyano\', \'dimethylamino\', and \'formyl\' would be arranged:\n\nFirst, \'cyano\' (C), then \'dimethylamino\' (D), then \'formyl\' (F), then \'hydroxy\' (H), then \'methoxy\' (M). So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nWait, but some substituents might need their positions adjusted for the lowest set.\n\nWait, for example, the cyano is at position 5. If the molecule is rotated so that the cyano\'s position becomes lower, perhaps we can get lower numbers. Let me check if that\'s possible.\n\nHowever, once COOH is at position 1, and we have CHO at 3, we can see how the other substituent positions lie. Since all substituent positions are fixed by the given relative positioning, the assignment above (positions 1-6 with substituents) is necessary. Therefore, changing rotation would not change the numbering because once the principal group is at position 1, the direction of numbering is determined by the next highest priority substituents. However, in our case, the next highest substituent after COOH is the formyl (CHO) at position 3, so once that\'s placed at 3 (lower number than 5), it\'s fixed. Hence, the numbering is set accordingly.\n\nAnother point to check: since the substituents are numerous, maybe the use of numerical prefixes like di, tri, etc., is needed. However, here each substituent is a different type, so we just list them all.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of the amino group (dimethylamino) requires that in the substituent name, the \'amino\' is part of the substituent. So, the substituent at position 2 is \'dimethylamino\'.\n\nNow, according to IUPAC rules, substituent prefixes are written in alphabetical order, ignoring any multiplicative prefixes like di-, tri-, etc. So \'dimethylamino\' would be alphabetized under \'a\' (amino), since di- is a multiplicative prefix.\n\nThus, the order would be:\n\n- cyano (c)\n\n- dimethylamino (a) since \'dimethylamino\' is based on \'amino\', which starts with \'a\'\n\n- formyl (f)\n\n- hydroxy (h)\n\n- methoxy (m)\n\nTherefore, the correct order would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\nHence, the name is:\n\n5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nWait, but hydroxy is listed as \'hydroxy\' (h) which comes after \'formyl\' (f), so order seems correct.\n\nAnother check: Is 2-(dimethylamino) correct, or should it be 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)? Because the substituent is -N(CH3)2, which would be called dimethylamino. In IUPAC nomenclature, the substituent would be N,N-dimethylamino. So perhaps in the name, it should be written as 2-(dimethylamino) or 2-(N,N-dimethylamino).\n\nIn IUPAC, the preferred way is to use \'N,N-dimethylamino\' to indicate that both methyl groups are on the nitrogen. So likely, it should be 2-(N,N-dimethylamino). Similarly, the hydroxy group is \'hydroxy\', and the aldehyde is \'formyl\'.\n\nFormyl is an accepted substituent name for the aldehyde group (-CHO) when attached to a ring. Therefore, we can use \'formyl\' as the substituent name.\n\nThus, the tentative name is:\n\n5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nBut more check is needed. Let me verify all substituent names.\n\n- Carboxylic acid: suffix \'benzoic acid\'\n\n- Aldehyde (CHO) on benzene: prefix \'formyl\'\n\n- Cyano: \'cyano\'\n\n- Methoxy: \'methoxy\'\n\n- Hydroxy: \'hydroxy\'\n\n- Dimethyl amino: \'N,N-dimethylamino\'\n\nIndeed.\n\nAre all commas used properly and numbers in order? Also, the numbering has to be in such a way that numbers are as low as possible. Wait, after assigning COOH as 1, and considering substituent priority, we got the numbers as 2,3,4,5,6. Is it possible to get lower numbers for any substituent?\n\nSuppose after COOH at position 1, maybe numbering in the reverse direction gives other positions. For example, perhaps if COOH is position 1 and methoxy is position 4 in the other direction (then 4 and 5). Wait, but I think given the original arrangement, specifying all substituents correctly, this would not result in lower numbers.\n\nHence, the name I composed earlier is likely correct.\n\nBut another check: in benzoic acids, substituents on the benzene ring are assigned numbers relative to the carboxylic acid group. The lowest possible set of numbers is used. So the direction is chosen after fixing the COOH at position 1, to give the remaining substituents the lowest possible numbers. However, in this case, with substituents in consecutive positions (positions 2,3,4,5,6), maybe rotating the ring could optimize this?\n\nIf I leave COOH at 1 and proceed to look for another numbering which could yield positions like 1,2,3,4,5 but in reverse order. However, in the given case, the substituents are on positions 1-6, which in a benzene ring, after 1, the closest substituents are 2 and 6. Moving counterclockwise instead of clockwise, would positions 2 become positions 6, but the number for substituents might actually increase. For example, changing direction will lead some substituent positions to decrease while others increase, but perhaps some might get lower numbers.\n\nAlternatively, if the numbering is done such that, in one direction, substituent 1 (COOH), substituent at 2 (N,N-dimethylamino), but another substituent (CHO) at 3, and in another direction, COOH at position 1, then the dimethylamino would be at 6, cho at 5, etc.\n\nBut if we try that, then positions would be:\n\nPosition 1: COOH\n\nPosition 6: dimethylamino\n\nPosition 5: CN\n\nPosition 4: methoxy\n\nPosition 3: OH\n\nPosition 2: CHO\n\nWait, but this arrangement does not comply with the original substituent relationships. Because:\n\n- CHO should be meta to COOH and CN. For example, if COOH is at position 1 and CHO is at 2 (adjacent), which is wrong as they must be meta.\n\nTherefore, this is not possible. The original constraints fix the substituent positions. So, we mustn\'t rotate to the extent that substituents which are meta become adjacent.\n\nHence, the substituent positions are fixed as per the problem\'s description. Therefore, given that the current numbering yields substituents in positions 1 through 6, and the lowest possible numbers per seniority, the composed name is probably correct.\n\nHowever, let me check an official example for a similar complex substituent naming. Perhaps someone has a similar structure named.\n\nAlternatively, alternatively, hyphens and placement of numbers matter. Possibly there’s a Rule that requires listing substituents in the order that gives the lowest set of numbers for all substituents. However, again, in the problem’s given arrangement, the set of numbers {1,2,3,4,5,6} for the substituents is unavoidable given all the relative position constraints. Therefore, the numbering is fixed to positions as assigned.\n\nHence, the name I constructed earlier seems to be the correct IUPAC name. However, maybe there\'s a mistake in formyl vs something else? Wait, for –CHO as a substituent, when attached to a benzene ring, the proper prefix is "formyl". So that seems correct. For instance, benzaldehyde would be benzene with a formyl group.\n\nWait, benzaldehyde is a correct name, yes, but when it\'s a substituent in a larger molecule, like attached to another ring, you use "formyl".\n\nFor example, 3-formylbenzoic acid. So yes, 3-formyl is correct.\n\nTherefore, the given structure\'s IUPAC name should be:\n\n5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nBut there is one thing left: Uniệu gì đó? Wait – the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino at ortho to COOH. According to problem statement: "Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group."\n\nIn the assigned positions, position 2 is N,N-dimethylamino and position 6 is hydroxy. Hence, both ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6). The methoxy is position 4, para to COOH. AND both methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (6) are ortho to nitrile (CN at 5). That\'s correct: positions 4 and 6 are adjacent to 5, so if CN is at position 5, then 4 and 6 are ortho.\n\nTherefore, all constraints are satisfied. Hence, the final answer should be as written.\n\nAlternatively, verify once more that the substituents’ numbering and names are correct. If so, then proceed.\n\nYes, I think so. To make sure, perhaps we can also check this against PubChem or other structure drawing tools, but since I can’t access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge.\n\nHence, based on the given information and reasoning, the correct IUPAC name is:\n\n5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743811672, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5010, prompt_tokens=2610, total_tokens=7620, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The correct IUPAC name for the described molecule, after carefully analyzing the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring, is determined as follows:

1. **Principal Functional Group**: The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is the highest priority group, assigned position 1.
2. **Meta Substituents**: The carbaldehyde (-CHO) and cyano (-CN) groups are positioned meta to the carboxylic acid (positions 3 and 5, respectively).
3. **Ortho to Carboxylic Acid**: A hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethyl amino (-N(CH3)2) group are ortho to the carboxylic acid (positions 6 and 2, respectively).
4. **Para to Carboxylic Acid**: A methoxy (-OCH3) group is para to the carboxylic acid (position 4).
5. **Ortho to Cyano**: Both the methoxy (position 4) and hydroxyl (position 6) groups are ortho to the cyano group (position 5).

**Substituents in Alphabetical Order** (ignoring multiplicative prefixes):  
- Cyano (5)  
- Dimethylamino (2, as "N,N-dimethylamino")

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 possible numbers, considering their placement.

Alternatively, maybe the priority of substituents (other than the principal one) affects the direction of numbering. For example, after the principal functional group (COOH at 1), the next senior substituent would be carbaldehyde (CHO), then cyano (CN), then hydroxyl (OH), then methoxy (OCH3), then dimethylamino (N(CH3)2). So placing the carbaldehyde at position 3 would require positions 3,4,5 which might not be the lowest possible. However, if we number the ring in the opposite direction, perhaps those substituents get lower numbers? Let's see.

If we keep the carboxylic acid at position 1, the other substituents would be at positions 2,3,4,5,6 as previously assigned. Let me check the other direction. If we number the ring such that the direction from COOH goes through dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2) as position 6 instead of 2. Wait, actually, let me imagine the benzene ring again:

Visualizing the ring with COOH at position 1. Then, positions clockwise: 1,2,3,4,5,6. If COOH is at 1, then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Earlier setup is dimethyl amino at 2 (N(CH3)2), then next substituent at 3 (CHO), position 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH).

But if we number the ring counterclockwise from COOH (position 1), going to position 6 as the next, which would be adjacent. Then substituents would be in different positions.

Wait, perhaps if the numbering goes counterclockwise (left from COOH as position 1), then position 2 would be where I thought position 6 was. Wait, perhaps it's better to diagram.

Let me sketch a hexagon with position 1 at the top. Then going clockwise:

1: COOH

2: N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino)

3: CHO

4: OCH3 (methoxy)

5: CN

6: OH

However, if we instead number counterclockwise from position 1:

Position 1: COOH

Position 6: N(CH3)2

Position 5: something else

But I think the standard way to number is to get the lowest possible numbers after the principal group is fixed. Since the principal group is COOH at 1, the direction of numbering is chosen so that the next highest priority substituents get the lowest numbers. Alternatively, we might need to determine the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) that gives the substituents lower numbers.

But in this arrangement, with substituents at 1,2,3,4,5,6 as assigned, perhaps clockwise gives substituents at positions 2,3,4,5,6. Alternatively, if we go the other way, then maybe substituents would be at positions 6, 5, etc.

Alternatively, it's possible that when there are multiple substituents, once the principal group is fixed, the numbering is chosen such that the substituents next in priority get the lowest numbers. Let's check.

After COOH, the next highest priority groups are the carbaldehyde (CHO). So if CHO is in position 3 in one direction, but if in another direction, could it be in position 5 for lower numbering?

Wait, no. Because position 1 is COOH. If we start numbering clockwise, we go 1 (COOH), 2, 3 (CHO). If counterclockwise, COOH at 1, next position 6, then 5. But since we need the CHO to be placed at as low a number as possible. If in the initial assignment, CHO is at 3, and if we were to number the other direction, would CHO be at 5? That would be a higher number (5 >3), so maybe the initial direction is better.

Similarly, the cyano group is at position 5. Methoxy at 4. Are those numbers as low as possible?

Wait, maybe there's a way to reduce the numbers. Let me check alternative numbering. Suppose if we fix COOH at position 1 and proceed counterclockwise. Then, adjacent to COOH would be position 6 (instead of 2 in the other direction). So:

Position 1: COOH

Position 6: substituent (if N(CH3)2 here)

Position 5: substituent

But then would that change any numbers? Let me see. Suppose the substituents are placed such that COOH at 1, then positions 6 (N(CH3)2), 5 (let's say CN), 4 (OCH3), 3 (CHO or another group).

But this may not make sense because substituents would permute positions.

Wait, perhaps trying to reorient the ring could help, but given the description requires substituents to be meta, o may need detailed analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is correct as initial (clockwise from COOH). The substituent at position 3 (CHO) would then be the next highest priority. However, according to substituent priorities, carbaldehyde (CHO) is an aldehyde group, which has higher priority than cyano (CN), which in turn is higher than hydroxyl (OH), methoxy (OCH3), and dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2). But once the principal group is fixed (COOH), the rest are substituents ordered alphabetically, but the numbering is based on substituent positions. But this part may not be straightforward.

An alternative approach is to create a list of substituents in order of priority (after COOH):

- Carbaldehyde (CHO) – aldehydes are high in priority

- Cyano (CN)

- Hydroxyl (OH)

- Methoxy (OCH3)

- Dimethyl amino (N(CH3)2)

But actually, according to IUPAC's substituent priority list for numbering (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules?), the substituents are prioritized based on the first atom's atomic weight. For example:

- Oxygen containing groups (like CHO, COOH, OCH3, OH) have higher priority compared to nitrogen (N(CH3)2) and cyano (CN). Wait, but I might be mixing up some rules here.

Wait, in the context of substituents on a benzene ring, the priorities for numbering are determined by the substituent's seniority. The seniority order is determined by the substituent's functional group. The highest priority functional group (here COOH) gets the lowest number, and the rest are arranged to get the next lowest numbers, regardless of their own priority. Wait, no: actually, when choosing the direction for numbering, after the principal functional group is assigned, the direction is chosen so that the next highest priority substituents get the lowest number. But I need to confirm.

Wait, a better approach might be to use the IUPAC Blue Book rules for numbering.

IUPAC rules state that when there is a choice, the numbering starts at the group that comes first in their order of seniority (where the seniority list is given based on functional groups) and proceeds in such a direction as to give the next substituent the lowest possible numbers.

But in our case, carboxylic acid is the senior functional group, so it gets the lowest possible number. Since there's only one carboxylic acid group, we assign it to position 1. Then, the numbering direction is chosen such that the remaining substituents get the lowest possible set of numbers.

The substituents left are: CHO (aldehyde), CN (cyano), OH (hydroxyl), OCH3 (methoxy), and N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino). According to substituent seniority for numbering, after the principal group, substituents are considered in order of their own priority. The priority order of functional groups (from high to low) would be:

1. Aldehyde (CHO)

2. Cyano (CN)

3. Hydroxyl (OH)

4. Methoxy (OCH3)

5. Amino (N(CH3)2)

So following this, after the carboxylic acid (COOH), the next highest priority is the aldehyde (CHO). Therefore, we should number the ring such that the aldehyde group gets the next lowest possible number. In the current setup, the aldehyde is at position 3. If the numbering direction could make it position 5, but 5 is a higher number than 3, so numerical values are lower when the aldehyde is at position 3 compared to if it's elsewhere. Therefore, keeping it at 3 is better. Similarly, the cyano is next in priority at position 5. Is that the lowest possible after CHO? Let's check.

In our initial arrangement, carboxylic acid at 1, then aldehyde at 3 (two positions away). If we rotated the ring so that the aldehyde came at position 5 instead of 3, the numbers would be higher (since then positions 5,6, etc.), so 3 is better. Therefore, the current numbering is appropriate.

Then, we proceed to the remaining substituents.

Thus, substituent positions with their groups:

1: COOH (carboxylic acid)

2: N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino)

3: CHO (carbaldehyde)

4: OCH3 (methoxy)

5: CN (cyano)

6: OH (hydroxyl)

Now, constructing the name, the substituents need to be ordered alphabetically. Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are considered in alphabetical order when writing the name, regardless of their position. The numbering is determined by priority first, then numbering to get the lowest numbers, then substituents are listed alphabetically.

However, wait again, maybe I need to verify current IUPAC practice. The substituents are cited in alphabetical order in the name, but the numbering is determined based on the seniority of the functional groups and the lowest numbering.

So once we have the positions decided as per the numbering:

The benzene ring has substituents in positions 1 (COOH), 2 (N(CH3)2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH).

But since COOH is the principal group, the parent structure is benzoic acid. The other substituents are considered as substituents. Then, using numbering relative to the carboxylic acid.

In such polysubstituted benzoic acids, the name is constructed by citing the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by their respective position numbers.

But the methoxy and hydroxyl and other groups need to be considered. Let's list them:

Positions:

2: (dimethylamino)

3: formyl (from carbaldehyde)

4: methoxy

5: cyano

6: hydroxy

But wait, the parent is benzoic acid. So the base name is benzoic acid, with substituents listed as prefixes in alphabetical order.

The substituent prefixes (with their positions) are:

2-(dimethylamino)

3-formyl

4-methoxy

5-cyano

6-hydroxy

Additionally, position 1 is the carboxylic acid, which is used as the suffix.

But when there are multiple substituents, they are ordered alphabetically followed by the parent hydrocarbon. So in the final name, the substituents are ordered alphabetically, each with their position numbers. So first, check the alphabetical order of the substituents.

Here, the substituent prefixes would be:

cyano (position 5)

dimethylamino (position 2)

formyl (position 3)

hydroxy (position 6)

methoxy (position 4)

Now, alphabetical order:

Cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Therefore, the substituents are listed as 5-cyano, 2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 6-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Hence, the name would start with these substituents in that order, followed by 'benzoic acid'. However, the numbering might not need commas if all positions are specified, but with such complex substituents, care must be taken.

Alternatively, to confirm whether the order is correct.

But wait, in alphabetical order, prefixes like 'hydroxy', 'methoxy', 'cyano', 'dimethylamino', and 'formyl' would be arranged:

First, 'cyano' (C), then 'dimethylamino' (D), then 'formyl' (F), then 'hydroxy' (H), then 'methoxy' (M). So yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, putting it all together:

5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but some substituents might need their positions adjusted for the lowest set.

Wait, for example, the cyano is at position 5. If the molecule is rotated so that the cyano's position becomes lower, perhaps we can get lower numbers. Let me check if that's possible.

However, once COOH is at position 1, and we have CHO at 3, we can see how the other substituent positions lie. Since all substituent positions are fixed by the given relative positioning, the assignment above (positions 1-6 with substituents) is necessary. Therefore, changing rotation would not change the numbering because once the principal group is at position 1, the direction of numbering is determined by the next highest priority substituents. However, in our case, the next highest substituent after COOH is the formyl (CHO) at position 3, so once that's placed at 3 (lower number than 5), it's fixed. Hence, the numbering is set accordingly.

Another point to check: since the substituents are numerous, maybe the use of numerical prefixes like di, tri, etc., is needed. However, here each substituent is a different type, so we just list them all.

Additionally, the presence of the amino group (dimethylamino) requires that in the substituent name, the 'amino' is part of the substituent. So, the substituent at position 2 is 'dimethylamino'.

Now, according to IUPAC rules, substituent prefixes are written in alphabetical order, ignoring any multiplicative prefixes like di-, tri-, etc. So 'dimethylamino' would be alphabetized under 'a' (amino), since di- is a multiplicative prefix.

Thus, the order would be:

- cyano (c)

- dimethylamino (a) since 'dimethylamino' is based on 'amino', which starts with 'a'

- formyl (f)

- hydroxy (h)

- methoxy (m)

Therefore, the correct order would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Hence, the name is:

5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but hydroxy is listed as 'hydroxy' (h) which comes after 'formyl' (f), so order seems correct.

Another check: Is 2-(dimethylamino) correct, or should it be 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)? Because the substituent is -N(CH3)2, which would be called dimethylamino. In IUPAC nomenclature, the substituent would be N,N-dimethylamino. So perhaps in the name, it should be written as 2-(dimethylamino) or 2-(N,N-dimethylamino).

In IUPAC, the preferred way is to use 'N,N-dimethylamino' to indicate that both methyl groups are on the nitrogen. So likely, it should be 2-(N,N-dimethylamino). Similarly, the hydroxy group is 'hydroxy', and the aldehyde is 'formyl'.

Formyl is an accepted substituent name for the aldehyde group (-CHO) when attached to a ring. Therefore, we can use 'formyl' as the substituent name.

Thus, the tentative name is:

5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

But more check is needed. Let me verify all substituent names.

- Carboxylic acid: suffix 'benzoic acid'

- Aldehyde (CHO) on benzene: prefix 'formyl'

- Cyano: 'cyano'

- Methoxy: 'methoxy'

- Hydroxy: 'hydroxy'

- Dimethyl amino: 'N,N-dimethylamino'

Indeed.

Are all commas used properly and numbers in order? Also, the numbering has to be in such a way that numbers are as low as possible. Wait, after assigning COOH as 1, and considering substituent priority, we got the numbers as 2,3,4,5,6. Is it possible to get lower numbers for any substituent?

Suppose after COOH at position 1, maybe numbering in the reverse direction gives other positions. For example, perhaps if COOH is position 1 and methoxy is position 4 in the other direction (then 4 and 5). Wait, but I think given the original arrangement, specifying all substituents correctly, this would not result in lower numbers.

Hence, the name I composed earlier is likely correct.

But another check: in benzoic acids, substituents on the benzene ring are assigned numbers relative to the carboxylic acid group. The lowest possible set of numbers is used. So the direction is chosen after fixing the COOH at position 1, to give the remaining substituents the lowest possible numbers. However, in this case, with substituents in consecutive positions (positions 2,3,4,5,6), maybe rotating the ring could optimize this?

If I leave COOH at 1 and proceed to look for another numbering which could yield positions like 1,2,3,4,5 but in reverse order. However, in the given case, the substituents are on positions 1-6, which in a benzene ring, after 1, the closest substituents are 2 and 6. Moving counterclockwise instead of clockwise, would positions 2 become positions 6, but the number for substituents might actually increase. For example, changing direction will lead some substituent positions to decrease while others increase, but perhaps some might get lower numbers.

Alternatively, if the numbering is done such that, in one direction, substituent 1 (COOH), substituent at 2 (N,N-dimethylamino), but another substituent (CHO) at 3, and in another direction, COOH at position 1, then the dimethylamino would be at 6, cho at 5, etc.

But if we try that, then positions would be:

Position 1: COOH

Position 6: dimethylamino

Position 5: CN

Position 4: methoxy

Position 3: OH

Position 2: CHO

Wait, but this arrangement does not comply with the original substituent relationships. Because:

- CHO should be meta to COOH and CN. For example, if COOH is at position 1 and CHO is at 2 (adjacent), which is wrong as they must be meta.

Therefore, this is not possible. The original constraints fix the substituent positions. So, we mustn't rotate to the extent that substituents which are meta become adjacent.

Hence, the substituent positions are fixed as per the problem's description. Therefore, given that the current numbering yields substituents in positions 1 through 6, and the lowest possible numbers per seniority, the composed name is probably correct.

However, let me check an official example for a similar complex substituent naming. Perhaps someone has a similar structure named.

Alternatively, alternatively, hyphens and placement of numbers matter. Possibly there’s a Rule that requires listing substituents in the order that gives the lowest set of numbers for all substituents. However, again, in the problem’s given arrangement, the set of numbers {1,2,3,4,5,6} for the substituents is unavoidable given all the relative position constraints. Therefore, the numbering is fixed to positions as assigned.

Hence, the name I constructed earlier seems to be the correct IUPAC name. However, maybe there's a mistake in formyl vs something else? Wait, for –CHO as a substituent, when attached to a benzene ring, the proper prefix is "formyl". So that seems correct. For instance, benzaldehyde would be benzene with a formyl group.

Wait, benzaldehyde is a correct name, yes, but when it's a substituent in a larger molecule, like attached to another ring, you use "formyl".

For example, 3-formylbenzoic acid. So yes, 3-formyl is correct.

Therefore, the given structure's IUPAC name should be:

5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

But there is one thing left: Uniệu gì đó? Wait – the hydroxyl and dimethyl amino at ortho to COOH. According to problem statement: "Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group."

In the assigned positions, position 2 is N,N-dimethylamino and position 6 is hydroxy. Hence, both ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6). The methoxy is position 4, para to COOH. AND both methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (6) are ortho to nitrile (CN at 5). That's correct: positions 4 and 6 are adjacent to 5, so if CN is at position 5, then 4 and 6 are ortho.

Therefore, all constraints are satisfied. Hence, the final answer should be as written.

Alternatively, verify once more that the substituents’ numbering and names are correct. If so, then proceed.

Yes, I think so. To make sure, perhaps we can also check this against PubChem or other structure drawing tools, but since I can’t access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge.

Hence, based on the given information and reasoning, the correct IUPAC name is:

5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Here’s the priority order of functional groups for substituents:\n\nCarboxylic acid (principal), then aldehydes, then cyano, then others. Since the COOH is position 1, the next highest priority substituent (carbaldehyde, position 3) would influence direction of numbering. Wait, but once the principal group is fixed, numbering starts from that group and proceeds in the direction that gives the next substituents the lowest possible numbers.\n\nSo with the carboxylic acid at position 1, moving clockwise would count to carbaldehyde at position 3, versus counterclockwise which would reach carbaldehyde at position 5 (but meta groups are at positions 3 and 5—originally, perhaps the aldehyde is at position 3 and cyano at 5).\n\nAlternatively, suppose the principal group is COOH at 1; then the aldehyde is next highest priority and could affect the direction for the lower substituent positions. Let me confirm the numbering.\n\nStarting at COOH (1), if the next highest substituent (CHO) is at position 3, then the substituents selected would be positions 1, 3, and 5 (COOH, CHO, CN). So if turning clockwise from 1 (COOH at 1), next is 2 (dimethylamino and methoxy?), but this may conflict. Alternatively, perhaps numbering needs to alternate directions to minimize numbers. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, if COOH is at position 1, which direction gives the lowest numbers for the other substituents. Let\'s assume positions 1 (COOH), 2 (N(CH3)2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH). Let\'s check the substituents\' positions in this case. But in this case, the cyano group is at position 5.\n\nBut perhaps there\'s a different numbering. Wait, maybe when multiple substituents are present, the principal group is assigned the lowest possible position number, then the rest are directed to give the lowest next substituents. But once the principal group is fixed, the numbering proceeds in a way to give the lowest possible numbers to the remaining substituents, considering their positions.\n\nBut according to IUPAC rules, for choosing the principal chain or ring (here benzene), the substituents are arranged to give the substituents the lowest set of numbers. The principal functional group should be given the lowest possible number, which here is carboxylic acid at position 1. Then the remaining substituents are numbered in the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) that gives the next substituent(s) the lowest possible numbers.\n\nBut now, considering that after COOH at position 1, the next highest priority substituent is carbaldehyde (CHO) which is one of the "principal" functional groups lower than carboxylic acid but higher than other substituents. According to seniority of functional groups, aldehydes are higher than cyano, etc.\n\nPerhaps the numbering could be arranged such that after COOH, the aldehyde is in priority for lower numbering, but since all substituents must maintain their meta positions, the aldehyde would be either at 3 or 5. Let me verify this.\n\nAssuming COOH is position 1. Moving clockwise, substituent at next positions are, position 2 (N(CH3)2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH). If the direction were counter-clockwise, position 1 to 6 (OH), then 5 (CN), but that\'s more distant. Wait. No—the numbering starts at COOH (position 1), and moving either direction. To see which direction gives the next substituents lower numbers. The substituents after CHO would appear in positions 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. In the current arrangement, CHO is at 3 while if we moved the other way, maybe it could be at 5. But in the initial user\'s description, the three main substituents (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to one another, so they must be in positions 1, 3, and 5 (assuming COOH is at 1 and direction gives CHO at 3 and CN at 5). Alternatively, positions 1,5, and 3.\n\nWait—meta positions are separated by two carbon atoms. So COOH at 1, then the meta substituents would be at 3 and 5, which are two positions away each. So positions 1 (COOH), 3 (CHO), and 5 (CN).\n\nThen, looking at the rest:\n\n- Ortho to COOH (position 1) would be positions 2 and 6.\n\nHydroxyl and dimethylamino must be here (because user said ortho to COOH are hydroxyl and dimethylamino). Then the para to COOH is position 4 (methoxy). Also, the hydroxyl and methoxy are both ortho to the nitrile (position 5). Let\'s check that:\n\nThe nitrile is at position 5. Ortho to cyan are positions 4 and 6. The methoxy is at position 4, and hydroxyl at 6. So yes, both methoxy and hydroxyl are ortho to CN at 5.\n\nThat arrangement works. So substituent positions:\n\n1: COOH\n2: N(CH3)₂\n3: CHO\n4: OCH3\n5: CN\n6: OH\n\nNow, the substituents and their order of citation in the name. The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so suffix is "-carboxylic acid." Substituents should be ordered alphabetically as prefixes.\n\nThe substituents are:\n\n- At 2: dimethylamino (N,N-dimethylamino)\n- At 3: formyl (from carbaldehyde)\n- At 4: methoxy\n- At 5: cyano\n- At 6: hydroxy\n\nHowever, carbaldehyde is a substituent that might be named as "formyl," but when attached to a ring, the carbaldehyde is considered as the aldehyde group as a substituent. Alternatively, the formal name might list substituents like hydroxyl, methoxy, cyan, formyl, and dimethylamino.\n\nWait, I need to confirm how each group is named as a substituent:\n\n- Carboxylic acid (-COOH) → "-carboxylic acid" (suffix)\n- Carbaldehyde (CHO) → "formyl" as a substituent (prefix)\n- Cyano (CN) → "cyano" (prefix)\n- Hydroxyl (OH) → "hydroxy" (prefix)\n- Methoxy (OCH3) → "methoxy" (prefix)\n- Dimethylamino (N(CH3)₂) → "dimethylamino" (prefix)\n\nNow, the numbering should have the correct order. The substituents are arranged in alphabetical order when assigning the prefixes.\n\nThe order of substituents (in alphabetical order):\n\nCyano (C) → priority with \'c\'\n\nDimethylamino (D)\n\nFormyl (F)\n\nHydroxy (H)\n\nMethoxy (M)\n\nBut wait, the order is based on the first letter of the substituent name (ignoring any prefixes like di-, tri-). Let\'s check:\n\n- “Cyano” (C)\n- “Dimethylamino” → compare \'m\' for methylamino? Wait, actually, substituents are named and ordered alphabetically using their prefix names. So “dimethylamino” is under \'a\' (for amino), because the substituent name is “amino” with two methyl groups. Therefore, when alphabetizing, ignore the substituent prefixes (di-, tri-, etc.) and use the parent name. So “amino” (A), then “cyano” (C), “formyl” (F), “hydroxy” (H), “methoxy” (M). Thus the order would be amino (dimethylamino) as A, followed by C, F, H, M.\n\nWait, that\'s a critical point. The correct order for substituent prefixes in IUPAC names uses alphabetical order based on the substituent\'s first letter, disregarding any multiplicative prefixes like di-, tri-, etc. For example, "dimethylamino" starts with \'a\' (for amino). Let me confirm this via IUPAC rules. \n\nYes: the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, disregarding any numerical (di, tri) prefixes. So “amino” would come before “chloro”, even if the amino group has substituents like dimethyl. Therefore, in this case, the substituents are:\n\n1. Amino (dimethylamino) → (A)\n2. Cyano → (C)\n3. Formyl → (F)\n4. Hydroxy → (H)\n5. Methoxy → (M)\n\nSo the order would be: 3-amino (from dimethylamino), 5-cyano, 2-formyl, 6-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n\nBut that may require confirming, actually. Let\'s recast:\n\nSubstituent names (with their alphabetical first letters):\n\n1. Dimethylamino → Parent: "amino" (A)\n2. Cyano (C)\n3. Formyl (F)\n4. Hydroxy (H)\n5. Methoxy (M)\n\nSo sorted alphabetically, the order is:\n\n3-amino (dimethylamino) at position 2,\n\nfollowed by 5-cyano (position 5),\n\nthen 3-formyl (position 3),\n\nthen 6-hydroxy (position 6),\n\nthen 4-methoxy (position 4).\n\nBut the positions assigned to each substituent are based on the numbering, which has COOH at position 1 and the ring numbered clockwise (as earlier):\n\nPosition 1: COOH\n\nPosition 2: N(CH3)₂\n\nPosition 3: CHO\n\nPosition 4: OCH3\n\nPosition 5: CN\n\nPosition 6: OH\n\nSo in alphabetical order, substituents are:\n\n- amino (dimethylamino) at 2,\n\n- cyano at 5,\n\n- formyl at 3,\n\n- hydroxy at 6,\n\n- methoxy at 4.\n\nTherefore, the name should start with the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by their position numbers, followed by "benzoic acid" as the parent structure. Additionally, commas separate numbers, and hyphens separate letters and numbers. If substituents are in the same position, the numbers are ordered from lowest to highest, but here, they are scattered.\n\nApplying this, the substituents in alphabetical order are:\n\n2-(dimethylamino),\n\n5-cyano,\n\n3-formyl,\n\n6-hydroxy,\n\n4-methoxy.\n\nBut wait, the order is based on the substituent\'s full name\'s first letter, so:\n\nAmino (dimethyl amino),\n\nCyano,\n\nFormyl,\n\nHydroxy,\n\nMethoxy.\n\nSo ordering them appropriately. So, the full name would start with "2-(dimethylamino)", then move to "5-cyano-", next "3-formyl-", then "6-hydroxy-", and finally "4-methoxy-", followed by "benzoic acid."\n\nHowever, when assembling the name, you have to list the substituents alphabetically. Let\'s list them by their substituent names. So:\n\n1. Amino (from 2-dimethylamino): alphabetically first (A)\n\n2. Cyano (C): next\n\n3. Formyl (F)\n\n4. Hydroxy (H)\n\n5. Methoxy (M)\n\nSo the substituents would be:\n\n2-(dimethylamino), 5-cyano, 3-formyl, 6-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.\n\nNow, arranging these alphabetically:\n\nA– dimethylamino comes first (position 2),\n\nC – cyano (position 5),\n\nF – formyl (position 3),\n\nH – hydroxy (position 6),\n\nM – methoxy (position 4)\n\nHence, the entire prefix would be:\n\n2-(dimethylamino)-5-cyano-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nWait, but substituents are ordered alphabetically: so it should be:\n\nFirstly, amino (2-(dimethylamino)),\n\nthen cyano (5-cyano),\n\nthen formyl (3-formyl),\n\nthen hydroxy (6-hydroxy),\n\nthen methoxy (4-methoxy),\n\nfollowed by benzoic acid.\n\nBut I need to check if substituents are arranged in alphabetical order regardless of their positions. So, in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order of their substituent names (ignoring any di, tri, etc., prefixes), with their respective position numbers.\n\nSo, for example, if substituent names are A, C, F, H, M, their names would accordingly be arranged:\n\nA: amino (at 2),\n\nC: cyano (5),\n\nF: formyl (3),\n\nH: hydroxy (6),\n\nM: methoxy (4)\n\nThus, the entire name would be:\n\n2-(dimethylamino)-5-cyano-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nIs this correct? But in alphabetical order, the order should not depend on the position numbers, only the substituent prefixes. So let me write them as "amino", "cyano", "formyl", "hydroxy", "methoxy".\n\nThe substituent parts ordered alphabetically are:\n\n\'A\' (amino from dimethylamino),\n\n\'C\' (cyano),\n\n\'F\' (formyl),\n\n\'H\' (hydroxy),\n\n\'M\' (methoxy).\n\nThus, the correct ordering would have them in this sequence: amino (2-(dimethylamino)), cyano (5-cyano), formyl (3-formyl), hydroxy (6-hydroxy), methoxy (4-methoxy). The corresponding numbers are ordered as 2, 5, 3, 6, 4.\n\nTherefore, writing the name as per IUPAC rules:\n\nTo construct the name:\n\n1. Identify the parent structure: benzoic acid (due to the carboxylic acid group).\n\n2. Number the substituents starting from the carboxylic acid (position 1) and proceeding in the direction that gives the next substituents the lowest possible numbers. But in our case, due to the previously established arrangement, the substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 1 (COOH). However, since the numbering is already determined, substituent positions are fixed as 2,3,4,5,6.\n\n3. Assign the substituent names and list them in alphabetical order, each with their respective position numbers.\n\nSo the substituents are named as follows:\n\n2-(dimethylamino)\n\n5-cyano\n\n3-formyl\n\n6-hydroxy\n\n4-methoxy\n\nNow, to arrange them alphabetically:\n\n- "Dimethylamino" → Starting with \'A\' (from amino)\n- "cyano" → \'C\'\n- "formyl" → \'F\'\n- "hydroxy" → \'H\'\n- "methoxy" → \'M\'\n\nThis gives the correct order:\n\n1. 2-(dimethylamino)\n2. 5-cyano\n3. 3-formyl\n4. 6-hydroxy\n5. 4-methoxy\n\nTherefore, combining these into the name:\n\n2-(Dimethylamino)-5-cyano-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nNow, double-check if lower number combinations can be achieved. Suppose we started numbering from a different position. Wait, but the substituent with the highest priority (COOH) must receive the lowest possible number, which dictates the numbering as beginning at that group. So position 1 is fixed as COOH.\n\nThus, this should be the final name, but let me see if alternative numbering could be used. For example, if we had rotated the ring, would substituents get lower numbers? For all other substitutents, when starting from COOH at position 1. If we look at their positions, positions 2, 3,4,5,6 are all in consecutive order. But since the substituents in those positions must be named according to their own priorities and positions. Since the substituent priority after the carboxylic acid doesn\'t affect the numbering because the carboxylic acid as the principal group locks the numbering direction to its placement. The next highest group would be carbaldehyde, so the numbering should go from COOH to aldehyde in the lower direction, which is position 3 here. However, as the aldehyde is at position 3 which is the next higher priority substituent, the numbering seems fixed. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, when there are multiple substituents, the numbering should also give the suffixes (if any - which here we only have -carboxylic acid) the lowest possible position. Once the position for the principal functional group (COOH) is selected, numbering proceeds to give the replacement suffixes (aldehyde, if any, but since the highest is COOH, you don\'t have another suffix) the lowest possible positions. However, in this case, there are multiple substituent prefixes, and the rule would be to proceed in the direction (from COOH) that gives the substituents (as substituents, considering their orderl) the lowest possible numbers.\n\nBut given that the substituents are already assigned positions 2,3,4,5,6, with position 3 being where carbaldehyde is located (formyl), which ranks higher than other substituents except for COOH. However, once the principal group is fixed at position 1, numbering proceeds in the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the substituents the next lowest numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recall IUPAC rule: when choosing the direction of numbering (once the principal functional group is located at position 1), the direction chosen is the one that gives the substituents the lowest possible set of numbers. So for substituents at positions 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH), the numbers are all already 2-6. If changing the direction from position 1 (COOH) could assign lower numbers to some substituents.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s see: If starting at COOH (position 1) and numbering clockwise, positions would be COOH=1, then clockwise: 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH), again.\n\nIf numbering counter-clockwise from COOH (1), then next position (going anticlockwise) would be 6 (OH), then 5 (CN), 4 (OCH3), etc. In that case, the substituent positions would be:\n\n1 – COOH\n\n6 – OH\n\n5 – CN\n\n4 – OCH3\n\n3 – ?\n\n2 – N(CH3)2\n\n3 in this alternate numbering would have. Wait, this is leading me to duplicate positions. Hmm, perhaps making this more confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it\'s redundant. Let\'s confirm. Position 1 is fixed (COOH). Then the substituents are arranged such that the next substituents in one direction have their positions. If numbering clockwise from COOH (1), the next positions are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The behavior mentioned in the problem description pins the substituents:\n\nOrtho to COOH: positions 2 and 6 with hydroxyl and dimethylamino.\n\nTo the meta of COOH: CHO at 3 and CN at 5.\n\nBut once numbered this way, we need to see if reversing the direction alternates numbering and perhaps gets lower numbers for other substituents. But perhaps not, considering the positions.\n\nActually, the current numbering will not give lower numbers by reversing direction. For example, the highest priority substituent after the carboxylic acid might be the aldehyde (formyl). But the formyl is at position 3 in the original numbering. If numbering in the opposite direction, would the aldehyde encounter a lower number?\n\nBut COOH is fixed at position 1. If the formyl\'s alternative position when numbered counterclockwise would be at position 5: let us consider:\n\nNumbering starts at COOH (position 1). Moving counter-clockwise, the positions are:\n\n1 (COOH), 6 (OH), 5 (CN), 4 (OCH3), 3 (CHO), 2 (N(CH3)2), back to 1.\n\nOh, if moving this way, the substituents would be:\n\n1- COOH\n\n2- N(CH3)2 (original position 2)\n\n3- CHO (originally 3, now 3?)\n\nWait no. The problem here is that changing direction adjusts all positions.\n\nWait, no. Let me use an example. Starting with COOH at position 1, benzene chil positions: imagine a hexagon. If we turn clockwise, it\'s 1↗2↗3↗4↗5↗6↗1. Alternatively, counter-clockwise is 1↖6↖5↖4↖3↖2↖1.\n\nIn the first scenario (original numbering):\n\n1: COOH\n\n2: N(CH3)2\n\n3: CHO\n\n4: OCH3\n\n5: CN\n\n6: OH\n\nIn the second scenario (counter-clockwise from COOH. Fixed COOH at 1, other positions become:\n\n1: COOH\n\n6: N(CH3)2 (since moving counter from 1)\n\n5: HO\n\n4: OCH3\n\n3: CN\n\n2: CHO\n\nBut this is probably not matching the actual arrangement. Wait, because substituent placement as described. Wait, the initial placement\'s relationships must hold. For example:\n\nThe user states that the hydroxy and dimethylamino groups are ortho to COOH, which should be positions 2 and 6 (in the original numbering) whether going clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\nWait, in any case, regardless of direction, the key is the relative positions:\n\nCOOH at 1,\n\northo groups at 2 and 6 (hydroxy and dimethylamino),\n\nmeta groups at 3 and 5 (CHO, CN),\n\npara group is OCH3 at 4,\n\nand CN is also ortho to OCH3 (position 4) and OH (position 6), which matches the problem statement.\n\nThe numbering as per the first arrangement gives that structure. If we change numbering direction, substituent positions might be shuffled but the structure remains the same, perhaps rearranging substituent numbers. But according to IUPAC rules, if there are multiple possible numberings for the same substituent configuration, the correct numbering is the one that gives the lowest set of numbers for the substituents. However, once the position of the principal group (COOH) is fixed at 1, the remaining substituents are numbered in a way that gives the next substituents the lowest numbers possible.\n\nLet\'s compare both scenarios:\n\nOriginal numbering (clockwise):\n\nCOOH at 1, substituents at 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 4 (methoxy), 5 (cyano), 6 (hydroxy).\n\nCounter-clockwise numbering:\n\nCOOH at 1,\n\nNext position (counter-clockwise) would be 6 → substituent becomes position 6, which in the original is OH. Then 5 → CN, and so on.\n\nBut retaining the same substituent layout, this alternate numbering would have different numbers for substituent positions, but structural relationships remain. It\'s worth determining which numbering provides substituents with lower numbers.\n\nHowever, substituting numbering. If I take benzene with COOH at position 1, compare the original numbering and counter-clockwise numbering positions. In both cases, substituents around the ring retain their relations. But depending on the direction, substituent numbers at positions may differ.\n\nIn order to assign numbering that gives the lowest possible numbers overall, you point the first substituent other than the principal group in the direction where the next earliest position picks lower number.\n\nGiven that after COOH at 1, the next highest priority substituent is likely the formyl group (CHO) at original position 3 or CHO at position original 3 (existing cases?).\n\nAlternatively, whether numbering from COOH keeps the substituents\' overall lower numbers. Let me imagine that after the principal group is fixed at 1, the lowest substituents numbers for the next senior substituent (CHO). For the formyl group, under normal rules, you want the lowest position possible. If choosing to go clockwise, CHO is assigned position 3. If counter-clockwise, perhaps it\'s assigned position 5, assuming configuration.\n\nBut I think the original numbering (position 3 for CHO) gives a lower number (3 vs 5 if inverted), so the clockwise numbering is superior, which keeps substituent numbers lower. Therefore, the initial numbering is correctly arranged.\n\nNow, after confirming the numbering, and if the substituent names are correctly ordered alphabetically, the IUPAC name comes to:\n\n2-(Dimethylamino)-5-cyano-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nBut perhaps a better check is whether there are substituents in adjacent positions that might have different ordering.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the IUPAC name for the described benzene derivative, we first identify the substituents and their relative positions on the benzene ring based on the problem statement:

1. **Principal functional group**: Carboxylic acid (COOH) is positioned at position 1.
2. **Meta to COOH**: Carbaldehyde (CHO) at position 3 and cyano (CN) at position 5.
3. **Ortho to COOH**: Hydroxyl (OH) at position 6 and dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂) at position 2.
4. **Para to COOH**: Methoxy (OCH₃) at position 4.
5. **Ortho to CN (position 5)**: Methoxy (position 4) and hydroxyl (position 6).

The substituents are arranged as follows:
- **Position 1**: Carboxylic acid (suffix: -carboxylic acid).
- **Position 2**: N,N-dimethylamino.
- **Position 3**: Formyl.
- **Position 4**: Methoxy.
- **Position 5**: Cyano.
- **Position 6**: Hydroxy.

### Alphabetical Order of Substituents:
When listing substituents in the IUPAC name, they are ordered alphabetically without considering di-/tri- prefixes. The order here is:
- **A**mino (dimethylamino at position 2).
- **C**yano (position 5).
- **F**ormyl (position 3).
- **H**ydroxy (position 6).
- **M**ethoxy (position 4).

### Final IUPAC Name:
**2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-5-cyano-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**

This name reflects the substituents' positions and their alphabetical order, with the carboxylic acid as the parent functional group.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 If the priority order of the substituents (other than the principal functional group) might affect numbering, but since the carboxylic acid is the principal group, the positions are fixed with COOH at position 1.

Wait, let me check substitution priorities again. Here’s the priority order of functional groups for substituents:

Carboxylic acid (principal), then aldehydes, then cyano, then others. Since the COOH is position 1, the next highest priority substituent (carbaldehyde, position 3) would influence direction of numbering. Wait, but once the principal group is fixed, numbering starts from that group and proceeds in the direction that gives the next substituents the lowest possible numbers.

So with the carboxylic acid at position 1, moving clockwise would count to carbaldehyde at position 3, versus counterclockwise which would reach carbaldehyde at position 5 (but meta groups are at positions 3 and 5—originally, perhaps the aldehyde is at position 3 and cyano at 5).

Alternatively, suppose the principal group is COOH at 1; then the aldehyde is next highest priority and could affect the direction for the lower substituent positions. Let me confirm the numbering.

Starting at COOH (1), if the next highest substituent (CHO) is at position 3, then the substituents selected would be positions 1, 3, and 5 (COOH, CHO, CN). So if turning clockwise from 1 (COOH at 1), next is 2 (dimethylamino and methoxy?), but this may conflict. Alternatively, perhaps numbering needs to alternate directions to minimize numbers. Let me confirm.

Wait, if COOH is at position 1, which direction gives the lowest numbers for the other substituents. Let's assume positions 1 (COOH), 2 (N(CH3)2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH). Let's check the substituents' positions in this case. But in this case, the cyano group is at position 5.

But perhaps there's a different numbering. Wait, maybe when multiple substituents are present, the principal group is assigned the lowest possible position number, then the rest are directed to give the lowest next substituents. But once the principal group is fixed, the numbering proceeds in a way to give the lowest possible numbers to the remaining substituents, considering their positions.

But according to IUPAC rules, for choosing the principal chain or ring (here benzene), the substituents are arranged to give the substituents the lowest set of numbers. The principal functional group should be given the lowest possible number, which here is carboxylic acid at position 1. Then the remaining substituents are numbered in the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) that gives the next substituent(s) the lowest possible numbers.

But now, considering that after COOH at position 1, the next highest priority substituent is carbaldehyde (CHO) which is one of the "principal" functional groups lower than carboxylic acid but higher than other substituents. According to seniority of functional groups, aldehydes are higher than cyano, etc.

Perhaps the numbering could be arranged such that after COOH, the aldehyde is in priority for lower numbering, but since all substituents must maintain their meta positions, the aldehyde would be either at 3 or 5. Let me verify this.

Assuming COOH is position 1. Moving clockwise, substituent at next positions are, position 2 (N(CH3)2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH). If the direction were counter-clockwise, position 1 to 6 (OH), then 5 (CN), but that's more distant. Wait. No—the numbering starts at COOH (position 1), and moving either direction. To see which direction gives the next substituents lower numbers. The substituents after CHO would appear in positions 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. In the current arrangement, CHO is at 3 while if we moved the other way, maybe it could be at 5. But in the initial user's description, the three main substituents (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to one another, so they must be in positions 1, 3, and 5 (assuming COOH is at 1 and direction gives CHO at 3 and CN at 5). Alternatively, positions 1,5, and 3.

Wait—meta positions are separated by two carbon atoms. So COOH at 1, then the meta substituents would be at 3 and 5, which are two positions away each. So positions 1 (COOH), 3 (CHO), and 5 (CN).

Then, looking at the rest:

- Ortho to COOH (position 1) would be positions 2 and 6.

Hydroxyl and dimethylamino must be here (because user said ortho to COOH are hydroxyl and dimethylamino). Then the para to COOH is position 4 (methoxy). Also, the hydroxyl and methoxy are both ortho to the nitrile (position 5). Let's check that:

The nitrile is at position 5. Ortho to cyan are positions 4 and 6. The methoxy is at position 4, and hydroxyl at 6. So yes, both methoxy and hydroxyl are ortho to CN at 5.

That arrangement works. So substituent positions:

1: COOH
2: N(CH3)₂
3: CHO
4: OCH3
5: CN
6: OH

Now, the substituents and their order of citation in the name. The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so suffix is "-carboxylic acid." Substituents should be ordered alphabetically as prefixes.

The substituents are:

- At 2: dimethylamino (N,N-dimethylamino)
- At 3: formyl (from carbaldehyde)
- At 4: methoxy
- At 5: cyano
- At 6: hydroxy

However, carbaldehyde is a substituent that might be named as "formyl," but when attached to a ring, the carbaldehyde is considered as the aldehyde group as a substituent. Alternatively, the formal name might list substituents like hydroxyl, methoxy, cyan, formyl, and dimethylamino.

Wait, I need to confirm how each group is named as a substituent:

- Carboxylic acid (-COOH) → "-carboxylic acid" (suffix)
- Carbaldehyde (CHO) → "formyl" as a substituent (prefix)
- Cyano (CN) → "cyano" (prefix)
- Hydroxyl (OH) → "hydroxy" (prefix)
- Methoxy (OCH3) → "methoxy" (prefix)
- Dimethylamino (N(CH3)₂) → "dimethylamino" (prefix)

Now, the numbering should have the correct order. The substituents are arranged in alphabetical order when assigning the prefixes.

The order of substituents (in alphabetical order):

Cyano (C) → priority with 'c'

Dimethylamino (D)

Formyl (F)

Hydroxy (H)

Methoxy (M)

But wait, the order is based on the first letter of the substituent name (ignoring any prefixes like di-, tri-). Let's check:

- “Cyano” (C)
- “Dimethylamino” → compare 'm' for methylamino? Wait, actually, substituents are named and ordered alphabetically using their prefix names. So “dimethylamino” is under 'a' (for amino), because the substituent name is “amino” with two methyl groups. Therefore, when alphabetizing, ignore the substituent prefixes (di-, tri-, etc.) and use the parent name. So “amino” (A), then “cyano” (C), “formyl” (F), “hydroxy” (H), “methoxy” (M). Thus the order would be amino (dimethylamino) as A, followed by C, F, H, M.

Wait, that's a critical point. The correct order for substituent prefixes in IUPAC names uses alphabetical order based on the substituent's first letter, disregarding any multiplicative prefixes like di-, tri-, etc. For example, "dimethylamino" starts with 'a' (for amino). Let me confirm this via IUPAC rules. 

Yes: the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, disregarding any numerical (di, tri) prefixes. So “amino” would come before “chloro”, even if the amino group has substituents like dimethyl. Therefore, in this case, the substituents are:

1. Amino (dimethylamino) → (A)
2. Cyano → (C)
3. Formyl → (F)
4. Hydroxy → (H)
5. Methoxy → (M)

So the order would be: 3-amino (from dimethylamino), 5-cyano, 2-formyl, 6-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

But that may require confirming, actually. Let's recast:

Substituent names (with their alphabetical first letters):

1. Dimethylamino → Parent: "amino" (A)
2. Cyano (C)
3. Formyl (F)
4. Hydroxy (H)
5. Methoxy (M)

So sorted alphabetically, the order is:

3-amino (dimethylamino) at position 2,

followed by 5-cyano (position 5),

then 3-formyl (position 3),

then 6-hydroxy (position 6),

then 4-methoxy (position 4).

But the positions assigned to each substituent are based on the numbering, which has COOH at position 1 and the ring numbered clockwise (as earlier):

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: N(CH3)₂

Position 3: CHO

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CN

Position 6: OH

So in alphabetical order, substituents are:

- amino (dimethylamino) at 2,

- cyano at 5,

- formyl at 3,

- hydroxy at 6,

- methoxy at 4.

Therefore, the name should start with the substituents in alphabetical order, each preceded by their position numbers, followed by "benzoic acid" as the parent structure. Additionally, commas separate numbers, and hyphens separate letters and numbers. If substituents are in the same position, the numbers are ordered from lowest to highest, but here, they are scattered.

Applying this, the substituents in alphabetical order are:

2-(dimethylamino),

5-cyano,

3-formyl,

6-hydroxy,

4-methoxy.

But wait, the order is based on the substituent's full name's first letter, so:

Amino (dimethyl amino),

Cyano,

Formyl,

Hydroxy,

Methoxy.

So ordering them appropriately. So, the full name would start with "2-(dimethylamino)", then move to "5-cyano-", next "3-formyl-", then "6-hydroxy-", and finally "4-methoxy-", followed by "benzoic acid."

However, when assembling the name, you have to list the substituents alphabetically. Let's list them by their substituent names. So:

1. Amino (from 2-dimethylamino): alphabetically first (A)

2. Cyano (C): next

3. Formyl (F)

4. Hydroxy (H)

5. Methoxy (M)

So the substituents would be:

2-(dimethylamino), 5-cyano, 3-formyl, 6-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Now, arranging these alphabetically:

A– dimethylamino comes first (position 2),

C – cyano (position 5),

F – formyl (position 3),

H – hydroxy (position 6),

M – methoxy (position 4)

Hence, the entire prefix would be:

2-(dimethylamino)-5-cyano-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

Wait, but substituents are ordered alphabetically: so it should be:

Firstly, amino (2-(dimethylamino)),

then cyano (5-cyano),

then formyl (3-formyl),

then hydroxy (6-hydroxy),

then methoxy (4-methoxy),

followed by benzoic acid.

But I need to check if substituents are arranged in alphabetical order regardless of their positions. So, in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order of their substituent names (ignoring any di, tri, etc., prefixes), with their respective position numbers.

So, for example, if substituent names are A, C, F, H, M, their names would accordingly be arranged:

A: amino (at 2),

C: cyano (5),

F: formyl (3),

H: hydroxy (6),

M: methoxy (4)

Thus, the entire name would be:

2-(dimethylamino)-5-cyano-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

Is this correct? But in alphabetical order, the order should not depend on the position numbers, only the substituent prefixes. So let me write them as "amino", "cyano", "formyl", "hydroxy", "methoxy".

The substituent parts ordered alphabetically are:

'A' (amino from dimethylamino),

'C' (cyano),

'F' (formyl),

'H' (hydroxy),

'M' (methoxy).

Thus, the correct ordering would have them in this sequence: amino (2-(dimethylamino)), cyano (5-cyano), formyl (3-formyl), hydroxy (6-hydroxy), methoxy (4-methoxy). The corresponding numbers are ordered as 2, 5, 3, 6, 4.

Therefore, writing the name as per IUPAC rules:

To construct the name:

1. Identify the parent structure: benzoic acid (due to the carboxylic acid group).

2. Number the substituents starting from the carboxylic acid (position 1) and proceeding in the direction that gives the next substituents the lowest possible numbers. But in our case, due to the previously established arrangement, the substituents are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 1 (COOH). However, since the numbering is already determined, substituent positions are fixed as 2,3,4,5,6.

3. Assign the substituent names and list them in alphabetical order, each with their respective position numbers.

So the substituents are named as follows:

2-(dimethylamino)

5-cyano

3-formyl

6-hydroxy

4-methoxy

Now, to arrange them alphabetically:

- "Dimethylamino" → Starting with 'A' (from amino)
- "cyano" → 'C'
- "formyl" → 'F'
- "hydroxy" → 'H'
- "methoxy" → 'M'

This gives the correct order:

1. 2-(dimethylamino)
2. 5-cyano
3. 3-formyl
4. 6-hydroxy
5. 4-methoxy

Therefore, combining these into the name:

2-(Dimethylamino)-5-cyano-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

Now, double-check if lower number combinations can be achieved. Suppose we started numbering from a different position. Wait, but the substituent with the highest priority (COOH) must receive the lowest possible number, which dictates the numbering as beginning at that group. So position 1 is fixed as COOH.

Thus, this should be the final name, but let me see if alternative numbering could be used. For example, if we had rotated the ring, would substituents get lower numbers? For all other substitutents, when starting from COOH at position 1. If we look at their positions, positions 2, 3,4,5,6 are all in consecutive order. But since the substituents in those positions must be named according to their own priorities and positions. Since the substituent priority after the carboxylic acid doesn't affect the numbering because the carboxylic acid as the principal group locks the numbering direction to its placement. The next highest group would be carbaldehyde, so the numbering should go from COOH to aldehyde in the lower direction, which is position 3 here. However, as the aldehyde is at position 3 which is the next higher priority substituent, the numbering seems fixed. Let me confirm.

Wait, when there are multiple substituents, the numbering should also give the suffixes (if any - which here we only have -carboxylic acid) the lowest possible position. Once the position for the principal functional group (COOH) is selected, numbering proceeds to give the replacement suffixes (aldehyde, if any, but since the highest is COOH, you don't have another suffix) the lowest possible positions. However, in this case, there are multiple substituent prefixes, and the rule would be to proceed in the direction (from COOH) that gives the substituents (as substituents, considering their orderl) the lowest possible numbers.

But given that the substituents are already assigned positions 2,3,4,5,6, with position 3 being where carbaldehyde is located (formyl), which ranks higher than other substituents except for COOH. However, once the principal group is fixed at position 1, numbering proceeds in the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) to give the substituents the next lowest numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should recall IUPAC rule: when choosing the direction of numbering (once the principal functional group is located at position 1), the direction chosen is the one that gives the substituents the lowest possible set of numbers. So for substituents at positions 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH), the numbers are all already 2-6. If changing the direction from position 1 (COOH) could assign lower numbers to some substituents.

Alternatively, let's see: If starting at COOH (position 1) and numbering clockwise, positions would be COOH=1, then clockwise: 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH), again.

If numbering counter-clockwise from COOH (1), then next position (going anticlockwise) would be 6 (OH), then 5 (CN), 4 (OCH3), etc. In that case, the substituent positions would be:

1 – COOH

6 – OH

5 – CN

4 – OCH3

3 – ?

2 – N(CH3)2

3 in this alternate numbering would have. Wait, this is leading me to duplicate positions. Hmm, perhaps making this more confusing.

Alternatively, maybe it's redundant. Let's confirm. Position 1 is fixed (COOH). Then the substituents are arranged such that the next substituents in one direction have their positions. If numbering clockwise from COOH (1), the next positions are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The behavior mentioned in the problem description pins the substituents:

Ortho to COOH: positions 2 and 6 with hydroxyl and dimethylamino.

To the meta of COOH: CHO at 3 and CN at 5.

But once numbered this way, we need to see if reversing the direction alternates numbering and perhaps gets lower numbers for other substituents. But perhaps not, considering the positions.

Actually, the current numbering will not give lower numbers by reversing direction. For example, the highest priority substituent after the carboxylic acid might be the aldehyde (formyl). But the formyl is at position 3 in the original numbering. If numbering in the opposite direction, would the aldehyde encounter a lower number?

But COOH is fixed at position 1. If the formyl's alternative position when numbered counterclockwise would be at position 5: let us consider:

Numbering starts at COOH (position 1). Moving counter-clockwise, the positions are:

1 (COOH), 6 (OH), 5 (CN), 4 (OCH3), 3 (CHO), 2 (N(CH3)2), back to 1.

Oh, if moving this way, the substituents would be:

1- COOH

2- N(CH3)2 (original position 2)

3- CHO (originally 3, now 3?)

Wait no. The problem here is that changing direction adjusts all positions.

Wait, no. Let me use an example. Starting with COOH at position 1, benzene chil positions: imagine a hexagon. If we turn clockwise, it's 1↗2↗3↗4↗5↗6↗1. Alternatively, counter-clockwise is 1↖6↖5↖4↖3↖2↖1.

In the first scenario (original numbering):

1: COOH

2: N(CH3)2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: OH

In the second scenario (counter-clockwise from COOH. Fixed COOH at 1, other positions become:

1: COOH

6: N(CH3)2 (since moving counter from 1)

5: HO

4: OCH3

3: CN

2: CHO

But this is probably not matching the actual arrangement. Wait, because substituent placement as described. Wait, the initial placement's relationships must hold. For example:

The user states that the hydroxy and dimethylamino groups are ortho to COOH, which should be positions 2 and 6 (in the original numbering) whether going clockwise or counter-clockwise.

Wait, in any case, regardless of direction, the key is the relative positions:

COOH at 1,

ortho groups at 2 and 6 (hydroxy and dimethylamino),

meta groups at 3 and 5 (CHO, CN),

para group is OCH3 at 4,

and CN is also ortho to OCH3 (position 4) and OH (position 6), which matches the problem statement.

The numbering as per the first arrangement gives that structure. If we change numbering direction, substituent positions might be shuffled but the structure remains the same, perhaps rearranging substituent numbers. But according to IUPAC rules, if there are multiple possible numberings for the same substituent configuration, the correct numbering is the one that gives the lowest set of numbers for the substituents. However, once the position of the principal group (COOH) is fixed at 1, the remaining substituents are numbered in a way that gives the next substituents the lowest numbers possible.

Let's compare both scenarios:

Original numbering (clockwise):

COOH at 1, substituents at 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 4 (methoxy), 5 (cyano), 6 (hydroxy).

Counter-clockwise numbering:

COOH at 1,

Next position (counter-clockwise) would be 6 → substituent becomes position 6, which in the original is OH. Then 5 → CN, and so on.

But retaining the same substituent layout, this alternate numbering would have different numbers for substituent positions, but structural relationships remain. It's worth determining which numbering provides substituents with lower numbers.

However, substituting numbering. If I take benzene with COOH at position 1, compare the original numbering and counter-clockwise numbering positions. In both cases, substituents around the ring retain their relations. But depending on the direction, substituent numbers at positions may differ.

In order to assign numbering that gives the lowest possible numbers overall, you point the first substituent other than the principal group in the direction where the next earliest position picks lower number.

Given that after COOH at 1, the next highest priority substituent is likely the formyl group (CHO) at original position 3 or CHO at position original 3 (existing cases?).

Alternatively, whether numbering from COOH keeps the substituents' overall lower numbers. Let me imagine that after the principal group is fixed at 1, the lowest substituents numbers for the next senior substituent (CHO). For the formyl group, under normal rules, you want the lowest position possible. If choosing to go clockwise, CHO is assigned position 3. If counter-clockwise, perhaps it's assigned position 5, assuming configuration.

But I think the original numbering (position 3 for CHO) gives a lower number (3 vs 5 if inverted), so the clockwise numbering is superior, which keeps substituent numbers lower. Therefore, the initial numbering is correctly arranged.

Now, after confirming the numbering, and if the substituent names are correctly ordered alphabetically, the IUPAC name comes to:

2-(Dimethylamino)-5-cyano-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

But perhaps a better check is whether there are substituents in adjacent positions that might have different ordering. For example, methoxy at position 4 and hydroxy at 6. In alphabetical listing, these are sorted by substituent name (M after H).

I'm also wondered if any of the substituents could be written in a different way for IUPAC naming. For example, the dimethylamino group is properly written as "dimethylamino" but in substitutive nomenclature, "amino" is the parent, so "N,N-dimethylamino".

Thus, substituent at position 2 is N,N-dimethylamino, and thus would be referred to as "2-(N,N-dimethylamino)" when citing in the name.

Additionally, in alphabetical ordering, "N,N-dimethylamino" starts with 'a' (amino), so correct.

Sketching the final name with the substituent list:

2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-5-cyano-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

This seems like the properly ordered name, according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.

Therefore, starting the numbering there, substituents occur at 1, 2, 3,4,5,6 as prior. Applying the substituents in order of priority: COOH at 1, then when numbering in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction to give substituents the lowest possible numbers. Let\'s verify.\n\nAlternatively, we might need to check possible rotation. For example, suppose the ring is rotated 120 degrees such that position 3 becomes position 2, but as principal group must be position 1. Wait, no. Since the carboxylic acid is fixed as substituent with highest priority, how to proceed. The substituents’ numbering starts from there.\n\nGiven that, substituents are arranged in the order I previously had. Then, elements named in alphabetical order when writing prefixes. Carboxylic acid as the suffix. Remembering that substituents are named in alphabetical order, disregarding any prefixes (like di, tri).\n\nLet me clear it all.\n\nSo, substituents:\n\nPositions:\n\n1: –COOH (carboxylic acid; suffix)\n\n2: –N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)\n\n3: –CHO (formyl or carbaldehyde)\n\n4: –OCH3 (methoxy)\n\n5: –CN (cyano)\n\n6: –OH (hydroxy)\n\nBut, after the numbering, we need to arrange in alphabetical order (ignoring any multiplying prefixes like di), and write them as substituents. The parent is benzene with the carboxylic acid getting the -oic acid suffix.\n\nThe full name includes substituents listed as prefixes in alphabetical order. The order would be: amino (for dimethylamino?), carbaldehyde (as formyl?), cyano, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\nWait, actually for IUPAC, substituents need to be named with their substituent names:\n\n- N(CH3)2: dimethylamino\n\n- CHO: formyl\n\n- CN: cyano\n\n- OCH3: methoxy\n\n- OH: hydroxy\n\nArranged in alphabetical order: cyano (c comes before d (dimethylamino), f (formyl), h (hydroxy), m (methoxy)). Let me check the alphabetical order.\n\nAlphabetization order in IUPAC:\n\nCompare first letters of substituent names, ignoring prefixes. So:\n\nCyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M). So, order is cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.\n\nThus, full name would be:\n\n4-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-6-(cyano)benzoic acid OR ?\n\nBut the numbering needs to be considered for lowest possible set. Wait, since the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and if we use that as the starting point (carboxylic acid at position 1). Then substituents at positions 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 4 (methoxy), 5 (cyano), 6 (hydroxy).\n\nBut depending on the direction of numbering. Alternate possibility: if we number counterclockwise after carboxylic acid as position 1, then position 2 could be hydroxyl and position 6 be dimethyl amino. But earlier assignment considered hydroxyl at 6 and dimethyl at 2. That needs verification.\n\nAlternatively, then based on what is ortho: If the methoxy and hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile (CN at 5), as described, that nitrile is at position 5; positions ortho to 5 are 4 and 6. Hence, methoxy at 4 (as given) and hydroxyl at 6. So must have hydroxyl at 6 and methoxy at 4. Then, positions described would be:\n\n1: COOH; 2: dimethylamino; 3: CHO; 4: OCH3; 5: CN; 6: OH.\n\nNow, carboxylic acid defines position 1. Is there a way to chose the order so substituents get lower numbers?\n\nIf we choose the direction from carboxylic acid moving towards the dimethyl amino (position 2), the next substituent in that direction would have a lower number (position 2 versus moving clockwise would reach dimethyl amino at 2 and hydroxyl at 6; maybe their positions don\'t allow lower numbers otherwise. Wait, let me check.\n\nBut given that para to COOH is methoxy (position 4). If we set COOH at 1, then methoxy is at 4. Nitrile is at 5, consistent with positions.\n\nHence, the substituent positions are fixed as described:\n\n1: COOH;\n\n2: N(CH3)2;\n\n3: CHO;\n\n4: OCH3;\n\n5: CN;\n\n6: OH.\n\nNow, satisfying alphabetical order:\n\nThe substituents (excluding COOH as the suffix) are:\n\n- N(CH3)2: dimethylamino (prefix: 2-)\n\n- CHO: formyl (prefix: 3-)\n\n- OCH3: methoxy (4-)\n\n- CN: cyano (5-)\n\n- OH: hydroxy (6-)\n\nIn alphabetical order: cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M)\n\nHence, arrangement would order these substituents in the name.\n\nTherefore, (all substituent positions):\n\n5-cyano-2-dimethylamino-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nHowever , there might be a mistake here. In multiple substituents, The numbers should perhaps be ordered to be as low as possible. So perhaps alternatively when substituents are listed, their positions are numbered so that their numbers are as low as possible? Wait, no. The numbering is determined first. Once a directional numbering is chosen to give substituents the lowest possible numbers (with the principal functional group having priority), then the substituents\' positions are fixed. This question\'s numbering must already have been determined with the carboxy group fixed at position 1. So substitutents end up at positions 2-6 as per above. The issue is the placement order when writing, which must follow alphabetical order but not the numbering order. So increasing order of the substituents\' location numbers, for when listing? No, in IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, preceded by their respective locants. However, the locants are arranged in ascending numeric order so as to get the lowest possible set. Then, for monotonic substituents, the substituent name for the alphabetical order:\n\nThus, after assigning substituents in order, if cooh is at the first position, perhaps the remaining substituents are arranged as per the numbers considered: 2,3,4,5,6. But trying to sort their locants numerically would place 2 first, followed by 3,4,5,6 but the order in the name should be alphabetical.\n\nWait, but the rule is: when writing the IUPAC name, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each preceded by their appropriate locant in numerical order. Each substituent\'s number is written from the earliest possible in their order, but since the numbering is fixed once position 1 is set (for the highest-priority functional group), the numbers cannot be altered arbitrarily. Therefore, provided the substituents are named with their fixed positions: let\'s check again the substitutions:\n\nAt positions: \n\n2: dimethylamino; \n\n3: formyl (carbaldehyde); \n\n4: methoxy; \n\n5: cyano; \n\n6: hydroxy.\n\nThus, substituents list in alphabetical order as per prior analysis: cyano (C) at 5, dimethylamino (D) at 2, formyl (F) at 3, hydroxy (H) at 6, methoxy (M) at 4. Therefore, combining by order:\n\n5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nBu t according to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the substituents are arranged alphabetically, with their corresponding locants arranged in ascending numerical order. However, it\'s necessary to order the substituents alphabetically first, regardless of their numerical order.\n\nLet me cross verify with an example: For example, if in a benzene ring there are substituents at positions 2, 3, 4 in alphabetical order such as Cl (chloro) at 2, Br (bromo) at 3, I think the name would be 2-bromo-3-chloro... Wait, no.\n\nNo, in the listing, substituents come in alphabetical order, and each is accompanied by their locant. So first in the list comes the substituent starting with \'b\' (bromo), then \'c\' (chloro). So even if the bromo is at 3 and chloro at 2, the name would be 2-bromo-3-chloro... Wait, that can\'t be correct. Actually, the order is alphabetical, but each substituent is named with its own locant regardless of their numerical order.\n\nWait, actually, substituent names are arranged alphabetically, and the locants are placed before each substituent. In such case, if substituents are arranged in the order of C, D, F, H, M alphabetically, thus names would precede in:\n\n5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nBut according to the substituents list, how is the order handled here?\n\nAlternate example: A benzene ring with substituents at positions 5 (cyano), 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 6 (hydroxyl), 4 (methoxy).\n\nIn alphabetical order, as per their substituent names:\n\ncyano (C)→ dimethylamino (D)→ formyl (F)→ hydroxyl (H)→ methoxy (M). Thus, the name begins with these substituents in that order, each preceded by their locants.\n\nSo the substituent sequence in the IUPAC name would be: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nTo check for correct combining forms and punctuation: The hyphenation. Each substituent\'s locant is separated by a hyphen, followed by the substituent name. The substituents themselves are separated by commas. Let’s check prompting from rules of punctuation, as per IUPAC.\n\nThe correct format is: substituents are listed in alphabetical order with their locants. Each substituent’s locant comes before the substituent name, each separated by a hyphen. If there are multiple substituents, they are separated by commas or hyphens. However, actually, when there are multiple substituents, the same applies: locant number, hyphen, substituent name, with substituents separated by commas? Wait, I think numerals and substituent prefixes are combined with numbers separated by commas, and each prefix linked.\n\nAlternatively, I’d better check again: at IUPAC nomenclature rules, in the substitutive nomenclature, substituents are named as prefixes in alphabetical order, each one precedes by the respective locant, and separate substituent prefix names are hyphenated. So multiple substituent prefixes are written in alphabetical order, each with their own locant(s).\n\nSo for the example:\n\nLocants 5 (cyano), 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 6 (hydroxy), 4 (methoxy). Alphabetical order: cyano (C), then d, dimethylamino; then f for formyl; h for hydroxy; m for methoxy. So the full name would be 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nBut the IUPAC allows some terms to be in parentheses if required, like when substituents have their own modifiers. For example, "dimethylamino" as a substituent combining "dimethyl" and "amino" might be enclosed in parentheses for clarity. However, according to current IUPAC rules, the substituent (dimethylamino) is written as a single substituent with the locants on the benzene ring. Given that, the structure should be written without parentheses? Alternatively, maybe "dimethylamino" already includes the substituent hierarchy.\n\nDouble-check: Substituent name is "dimethylamino"—I think that would be written as N,N-dimethylamino, but how is that handled? Wait, no, the group –NH(CH3)2 would be called dimethylamino. In IUPAC, when substituting “amino” with substituents, like when two methyl groups are attached to the amino group, which is then attached to the benzene ring. So the group –N(CH3)2 is called dimethylamino, and not requiring parentheses.\n\nWait, I might be misremembering. In substitutive nomenclature, the amino group (NH2–) when substituted with methyl groups, becomes an N-methylamino- or dimethylamino group. For a group like –N(CH3)2, the substituent is called dimethylamino. The parentheses can be used when there’s a prefix and substitution in order to clarify. However, typically, substituents are given as a prefix (without parentheses) unless necessary for clarity.\n\nThus, dimethylamino substituent is written as 2-dimethylamino. There is no need for brackets here. Another caution: In cases where substituents themselves have substituents, like (chloromethyl)phenyl, parentheses may be required, but not for simple ones like dimethylamino.\n\nTherefore, the correct name would be written: 5-cyano-2-dimethylamino-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nAnother possible consideration: opt for the suffix if any group might qualify. But in this case, the only suffix is carboxylic acid (benzoic acid). Carbaldehyde (CHO) is designated as a "formyl" substituent here. According to Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry – IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013 (the Blue Book), functional groups that must be cited as prefixes are typically lower in priority than the principal functional group. Since the principal functional group here is carboxylic acid (the suffix is -oic acid), the formyl group (CHO) is cited as a substituent (as "formyl"). Similarly, hydroxy, methoxy, cyano, and dimethylamino are all prefixes. Therefore, correct substituent names apply.\n\nBut, wait, a "carbaldehyde" is considered as a functional group with a priority higher than, say, hydroxy but lower than carboxylic acid. However, when the aldehyde is a substituent (i.e., the carbonyl is attached directly to the main chain, but in this when attached to a benzene ring as a substituent, it\'s on a benzene ring (a substituent), not the main chain. Hence, in such a case, even if the formyl group (CHO) was a substituent on the benzene ring (i.e., as a branch), it\'s named as a formyl group. Hence, (I believe) this is handled as a substituent prefix here, hence "formyl."\n\nThus, proceeding with the analysis, the correct IUPAC name should be as built above. However, confirming the positions again to ensure the hydroxyl is at 6. Since alteration nuances can affect actual numbering.\n\nBreaking Down:\n\nMain group: benzoic acid (carboxyl at position 1)\n\nAdjacenthyatt positions:\n\nPosition 2: dimethylamino\n\nPosition 3: formyl (CHO)\n\nPosition 4: methoxy (which is para to the carboxylic acid; correct since 1 and 4 are para, yes)\n\nPosition 5: cyano (meta to carboxylic acid at 1, and adjacent (ortho) to methoxy at 4).\n\nPosition 6: hydroxy (ortho to carboxyl at 1 and ortho to cyano at 5) which makes sense. Since methoxy at 4 and hydroxyl at 6 are both ortho to cyano (5), which is correct. That happens.\n\nThis reveals all positions are correctly aligned. Hence, confirmed. Hence, groupings are properly mapped.\n\nInternARRANGEMENT.\n\nNow, alternative checks: Look for systemmmatic numbering which would give lower numbers when possible. Since the primary functional group is carboxylic acid at position 1, alternative numbering is forbidden. The direction (clockwise or anticlockwise) should Assign the substituents lowest possible substitute numbers overall.\n\nIn this instance, by setting carboxy at 2 (seeing COOH somewhere else?), but the testatement data states that the OH and dimethyl amino are ortho to carboxylic acid, and those groups would be at in whichever position. However, since the carboxylic acid must keep position 1.\n\nAlternately, on a benzene ring, any position can be rotated but carboxylic acid is fixed. Wait, perhaps yes! Let me try. Suppose we have COOH fixed at position1. Then numbering either clockwise or counter-clockwise to give lower numbers. For example, positions when moving clockwise:\n\n1 (COOH)\n\n2 (N(CH3)2)\n\n3 (CHO)\n\n4 (OCH3)\n\n5 (CN)\n\n6 (OH)\n\nAlternatively, if we choose the direction the other way: shift positions around, realizing that would adjust the numbers. For example, moving counterclockwise from COOH 1, the first substituent is position2 = OH here. Wait, no. Location positions are only determined once we fix the first substituent. So, if COOH at 1, next is 2 adjacent. Since all substituents\' positions as given are fixed once COOH is fixed at 1. Hence there is no alternate numbering once we set which substituents are present. Hence, accordingly, the order is fixed.\n\nYani Subs has to move forward within the given arrangement. There\'s no way to result in lower numbers in this case.\n\nAnother angle: ensure that the positions adhere to being meta and ortho. For example:\n\nOrtho to carboxylic acid (positions 2 and 6): have OH and dimethylamino. Let me check—\n\nIf the hydroxyl is at6 and dimethylamino at2, that suffices as being ortho to COOH (positions 2 and6 for remaining substitutes which are next to position1.)\n\nFurther, methoxy at4 (para to COOH), which is para hence opposite (so position1 and4 are para). Meanwhile, nitrile at5, which is adjacent to methoxy at4 (ortho) and adjacent to hydroxylat6 (ortho), as well as nitrile at5 being para to positions2 and15? Yes, no. Por ejemplo, bacterial artwork.\n\nBut focusing as such, referring back to molecule topology seems correct.\n\nThus, the probable correct name is:\n\n5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nHowever, wirts and I double-checkpunctuation.\n\nAlternatively, the substituent at position3 is a carbaldehyde group—should that be treated as a -CHO group (formyl), coming alphabetically as F; or as "carbaldehyde," which might start with C. But there\'s ambiguity here. Let me check:.\n\nCopy that—IUPAC nomenclature for aldehyde group as substituent.\n\nIn benzoic acid derivatives, the aldehyde when attached to ring is considered a prefix "formyl." The free valence of the aldehyde is at the -CHO group attached as a substituent on the benzene. Thus, Correctly treats it as "formyl," not "carbaldehyde."\n\nThe term "carbaldehyde" is used when –CHO is treated as a functional group in the main chain but in this case, as a substituent, it\'s "formyl."\n\nTherefore, substituent should be "formyl" and alphabetized as F.\n\nThus, previous analysis holds.\n\nHowever, checking recommendations.\n\nAnswering (formatting) doubts:\n\n "dimethylamino": The correct substituent name is "[dimethylamino].". Wait, Depends on the hierarchy in the substituent. In this case, the substituent is an amino group (−NH−) substituted with two methyl groups → the correct prefix should be "dimethylamino."\n\nActually, in IUPAC, secondary and tertiary amines substituent must be specified using"N-alkyl" format.\n\nSo the substituent –N(CH3)2 should be named as "N,N-dimethylamino."\n\nThus, substituent is:N,N-dimethylamino.\n\nHence, correcting the name to 2-(N,N-dimethylamino).\n\nSo in the full name changes to replace "dimethylamino" with "N,N-dimethylamino", which requires parentheses as per the substituet：\n\nPrefix substituents that have multiplicative prefixes like di-, tri-, etc., or composed substituents (which have locants of their own), need to be put in parentheses.\n\nSo "N,N-dimethylamino" that-\n\nSo substituent is "N,N-dimethylamino," hence the name becomes:\n\n5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nThus, inserting "N,N" with parentheses.\n\nAh, so writing parentheses is necessary for substituents with branched substituents, in this case, to prevent confusion.\n\nTo verify: If an amino group is substituted with two methyl groups attached to the nitrogen, we need to use N,N-dimethylamino.\n\nMoreover, such substituent is written in brackets if the prefix includes locants.\n\nPhrasing so, ah, yes.\n\nAlso, notice that using "amino" indicates NH2, but in this case, when substituting the amino group, "N,N-dimethylamino." So, the substituted amino groups use "N" locant to specify substituents on the nitrogen.\n\nTherefore, the full proper substituent name for –N(CH3)2 is N,N-dimethylamino.\n\nAnd when included in the prefix, you put it within parentheses.\n\nHence, the substituent at position 2 is written as 2-(N,N-dimethylamino).\n\nChecking another example: the substituent -OCH3 is methoxy, which doesn\'t require parentheses; the substituent -OH as hydroxy; similarly, formyl (CHO) as formyl; cyano (CN) as cyano.\n\nThus, inverted commas out, the name should be written as 5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.\n\nI think this is naming it accurately.\n\nNow, testing for any mistakes in ordering or punctuation. Hyphens separate numeators and substituents.\n\nTherefore, the possible final answer is:\n\n5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid\n\nHowever, if "N,N-dimethylamino" is considered to alphabitize under "d," then the substituents\' alphabetical order would go： cyano (C), formyl (F), hydroxy (Ho’stat. Wait no substituent “…-methylamino” counts as starting with "d" for dimethylamino. So I previously considering the name as starting withdimethylamino under \'d\', but if it\'s "N,N-dimethylamino", does it start with \'N\', which the position with parentheses?\n\nWait, confusion here: When ordering substituents alphabetically, the hyphenated and bracketed parts are irrelevant, as only the first letter of the substituent name is considered. The substituent name here is dimethylamino. However, according to Blue Book, multiple authors follow this method:\n\nSubstituent prefixes such as dimethylamino would be alphabetized under "a" (for amino), while others within parentheses ... No, wait, how about ?\n\nWait, no. Compound substituents that include a functional group modify the parent hydride get a different consideration.\n\nActually, the \'N,N-dimethylamino\' group is considered under "a" for \'amino\' in alphabetizing because "dimethylamino" is an modified amino group. Let me confirm, substituents can be complex Sometimes to alphabetize. Let me differentiate between simplified substituent names vs. complex.\n\nThe expanded substituent name is N,N-dimethylamino group. However, substituent is written as ‘dimethylamino’ (even with stylistic conventions, sometimes considered under \'d\') but I need to check IUPAC rules.\n\nIn the IUPAC Blue Book, alphabetical order is based on the first letter of the substituent name, disregarding any prefixes such as di, tri, iso, etc. (but note that some substituant names start with such prefixes). For example, "isopropyl" is under i, "dimethylamino" would start with d, because the full name of the substituent is dimethylamino (which is a first letter here d, as not multiplicative prefix). However, substitute doctrine is somewhat ambiguous unless explicitly defined for alphabetizing.\n\nWait, in part of the complex substituents IUPAC RULES:\n\nComplex substituents are often alphabetized based on the entire substituent name, but substituent PRINCIPAL nomenclatures\'s multiplicative prefixes do not affect alphabetical order. Therefore, the full name, dimethylamino, its first character is \'d\' so sorted accordingly. But if the name is N,N-dimethylamino, called starting with \'N\' is disruptive. However, the multiplicative prefixes like \'dimethyl\' are not considered part of the basis for alphabetizing. The term \'amino\' is the root, and the substituents on the amino are considered, but alphabetizing question is challenging. Ireally need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, according to theBlueBook Rules, prefixes for substituents derived from parent hydrides sorted by first letter of the substituent names, disregarding non-parenthetical multiplicative prefixes, but taking substituent Prefixes derived as such...\n\nExamples from Blue Book:\n\nhydroxy- (h) comes before methyl- (m). Isopropyl- (i) comes before methyl- (m). \n\nAlso ‘tert-butyl’ (teena) before iso-Pr.\n\nNow, for N,N-dimethyl amino, acceptable as ‘dimethylamino’ not part of standard rankings. However, for systematic purposes, substituents like \'amino\' would be signed under \'a\'. But \'dimethylamino\'—how?\n\nThe "amino" group with substituents—each attached to the N as an alkyl group—these substituent alkyl groups are considered as subsidiary substituents and adopt their own two letters.\n\nHmmm,Even in paragraphifer substructure names, the principal name for –NH2 is amino. When substituted as –N(CH3)2, it is N,N-dimethylamino. So the ti titular.\n\nBut for alphabetizing, the name is \'dimethylamino\', starting with D.\n\nHowever, substituents including \'amino\' are probably considered under their principal name (amino), but when modified as dimethyl, one possibly must still consider the root \'amino\', but then. MULLingrew higher:\n\nActually, it\'s recommended that shortened services of substituents might be. For instance:\n\nGreen Book: ("Ethyl" precedes "methyl"; when substituents have in their own names prefixes like iso, the full name including the prefix determines yell stronger, so "isopropyl" comes before "m in.\n\nMore precisely:\n\nThe alphabetical order is determined by the first letter of the substituent name in full, exceptof minorcitation. For by Complexity and subsiehail\n\nNomenclature of Organic Chemistry: IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013, Section P-14.5 (Alphabetical order for prefixes) states:\n\n"The alphabetical order of simple prefixes (i.e., those describing atoms and unsubstituted substituents) is based on the first letter of their names.

The molecule described is a benzene ring with the following substituents arranged in specific positions relative to each other: a carboxylic acid (principal group) at position 1, a hydroxyl (OH) group and a dimethylamino (N,N-dimethylamino) group ortho to the carboxylic acid (positions 2 and 6), a carbaldehyde (CHO) and cyano (CN) group meta to the carboxylic acid (positions 3 and 5), and a methoxy (OCH₃) group para to the carboxylic acid (position 4). 

Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, the substituents are listed alphabetically with their respective locants. The carbaldehyde group is named as "formyl," and the dimethylamino group is specified with parentheses to clarify the substituents on the nitrogen. The methoxy, hydroxyl, and cyano groups are also included as prefixes. The full name is determined by starting the numbering at the carboxylic acid (position 1) and proceeding to list all substituents in alphabetical order.

**Final Answer:**  
5-Cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 However, perhaps adjusting numbering for lower numbers elsewhere—might alternative divisions yield lower numbers in the substituents.

However, since carboxylic acid is the principal functional group, carbon 1 is fixed where the carboxylic acid is. Therefore, starting the numbering there, substituents occur at 1, 2, 3,4,5,6 as prior. Applying the substituents in order of priority: COOH at 1, then when numbering in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction to give substituents the lowest possible numbers. Let's verify.

Alternatively, we might need to check possible rotation. For example, suppose the ring is rotated 120 degrees such that position 3 becomes position 2, but as principal group must be position 1. Wait, no. Since the carboxylic acid is fixed as substituent with highest priority, how to proceed. The substituents’ numbering starts from there.

Given that, substituents are arranged in the order I previously had. Then, elements named in alphabetical order when writing prefixes. Carboxylic acid as the suffix. Remembering that substituents are named in alphabetical order, disregarding any prefixes (like di, tri).

Let me clear it all.

So, substituents:

Positions:

1: –COOH (carboxylic acid; suffix)

2: –N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)

3: –CHO (formyl or carbaldehyde)

4: –OCH3 (methoxy)

5: –CN (cyano)

6: –OH (hydroxy)

But, after the numbering, we need to arrange in alphabetical order (ignoring any multiplying prefixes like di), and write them as substituents. The parent is benzene with the carboxylic acid getting the -oic acid suffix.

The full name includes substituents listed as prefixes in alphabetical order. The order would be: amino (for dimethylamino?), carbaldehyde (as formyl?), cyano, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, actually for IUPAC, substituents need to be named with their substituent names:

- N(CH3)2: dimethylamino

- CHO: formyl

- CN: cyano

- OCH3: methoxy

- OH: hydroxy

Arranged in alphabetical order: cyano (c comes before d (dimethylamino), f (formyl), h (hydroxy), m (methoxy)). Let me check the alphabetical order.

Alphabetization order in IUPAC:

Compare first letters of substituent names, ignoring prefixes. So:

Cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M). So, order is cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Thus, full name would be:

4-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-6-(cyano)benzoic acid OR ?

But the numbering needs to be considered for lowest possible set. Wait, since the carboxylic acid is at position 1, and if we use that as the starting point (carboxylic acid at position 1). Then substituents at positions 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 4 (methoxy), 5 (cyano), 6 (hydroxy).

But depending on the direction of numbering. Alternate possibility: if we number counterclockwise after carboxylic acid as position 1, then position 2 could be hydroxyl and position 6 be dimethyl amino. But earlier assignment considered hydroxyl at 6 and dimethyl at 2. That needs verification.

Alternatively, then based on what is ortho: If the methoxy and hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile (CN at 5), as described, that nitrile is at position 5; positions ortho to 5 are 4 and 6. Hence, methoxy at 4 (as given) and hydroxyl at 6. So must have hydroxyl at 6 and methoxy at 4. Then, positions described would be:

1: COOH; 2: dimethylamino; 3: CHO; 4: OCH3; 5: CN; 6: OH.

Now, carboxylic acid defines position 1. Is there a way to chose the order so substituents get lower numbers?

If we choose the direction from carboxylic acid moving towards the dimethyl amino (position 2), the next substituent in that direction would have a lower number (position 2 versus moving clockwise would reach dimethyl amino at 2 and hydroxyl at 6; maybe their positions don't allow lower numbers otherwise. Wait, let me check.

But given that para to COOH is methoxy (position 4). If we set COOH at 1, then methoxy is at 4. Nitrile is at 5, consistent with positions.

Hence, the substituent positions are fixed as described:

1: COOH;

2: N(CH3)2;

3: CHO;

4: OCH3;

5: CN;

6: OH.

Now, satisfying alphabetical order:

The substituents (excluding COOH as the suffix) are:

- N(CH3)2: dimethylamino (prefix: 2-)

- CHO: formyl (prefix: 3-)

- OCH3: methoxy (4-)

- CN: cyano (5-)

- OH: hydroxy (6-)

In alphabetical order: cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M)

Hence, arrangement would order these substituents in the name.

Therefore, (all substituent positions):

5-cyano-2-dimethylamino-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

However , there might be a mistake here. In multiple substituents, The numbers should perhaps be ordered to be as low as possible. So perhaps alternatively when substituents are listed, their positions are numbered so that their numbers are as low as possible? Wait, no. The numbering is determined first. Once a directional numbering is chosen to give substituents the lowest possible numbers (with the principal functional group having priority), then the substituents' positions are fixed. This question's numbering must already have been determined with the carboxy group fixed at position 1. So substitutents end up at positions 2-6 as per above. The issue is the placement order when writing, which must follow alphabetical order but not the numbering order. So increasing order of the substituents' location numbers, for when listing? No, in IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, preceded by their respective locants. However, the locants are arranged in ascending numeric order so as to get the lowest possible set. Then, for monotonic substituents, the substituent name for the alphabetical order:

Thus, after assigning substituents in order, if cooh is at the first position, perhaps the remaining substituents are arranged as per the numbers considered: 2,3,4,5,6. But trying to sort their locants numerically would place 2 first, followed by 3,4,5,6 but the order in the name should be alphabetical.

Wait, but the rule is: when writing the IUPAC name, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, each preceded by their appropriate locant in numerical order. Each substituent's number is written from the earliest possible in their order, but since the numbering is fixed once position 1 is set (for the highest-priority functional group), the numbers cannot be altered arbitrarily. Therefore, provided the substituents are named with their fixed positions: let's check again the substitutions:

At positions: 

2: dimethylamino; 

3: formyl (carbaldehyde); 

4: methoxy; 

5: cyano; 

6: hydroxy.

Thus, substituents list in alphabetical order as per prior analysis: cyano (C) at 5, dimethylamino (D) at 2, formyl (F) at 3, hydroxy (H) at 6, methoxy (M) at 4. Therefore, combining by order:

5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Bu t according to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the substituents are arranged alphabetically, with their corresponding locants arranged in ascending numerical order. However, it's necessary to order the substituents alphabetically first, regardless of their numerical order.

Let me cross verify with an example: For example, if in a benzene ring there are substituents at positions 2, 3, 4 in alphabetical order such as Cl (chloro) at 2, Br (bromo) at 3, I think the name would be 2-bromo-3-chloro... Wait, no.

No, in the listing, substituents come in alphabetical order, and each is accompanied by their locant. So first in the list comes the substituent starting with 'b' (bromo), then 'c' (chloro). So even if the bromo is at 3 and chloro at 2, the name would be 2-bromo-3-chloro... Wait, that can't be correct. Actually, the order is alphabetical, but each substituent is named with its own locant regardless of their numerical order.

Wait, actually, substituent names are arranged alphabetically, and the locants are placed before each substituent. In such case, if substituents are arranged in the order of C, D, F, H, M alphabetically, thus names would precede in:

5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

But according to the substituents list, how is the order handled here?

Alternate example: A benzene ring with substituents at positions 5 (cyano), 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 6 (hydroxyl), 4 (methoxy).

In alphabetical order, as per their substituent names:

cyano (C)→ dimethylamino (D)→ formyl (F)→ hydroxyl (H)→ methoxy (M). Thus, the name begins with these substituents in that order, each preceded by their locants.

So the substituent sequence in the IUPAC name would be: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

To check for correct combining forms and punctuation: The hyphenation. Each substituent's locant is separated by a hyphen, followed by the substituent name. The substituents themselves are separated by commas. Let’s check prompting from rules of punctuation, as per IUPAC.

The correct format is: substituents are listed in alphabetical order with their locants. Each substituent’s locant comes before the substituent name, each separated by a hyphen. If there are multiple substituents, they are separated by commas or hyphens. However, actually, when there are multiple substituents, the same applies: locant number, hyphen, substituent name, with substituents separated by commas? Wait, I think numerals and substituent prefixes are combined with numbers separated by commas, and each prefix linked.

Alternatively, I’d better check again: at IUPAC nomenclature rules, in the substitutive nomenclature, substituents are named as prefixes in alphabetical order, each one precedes by the respective locant, and separate substituent prefix names are hyphenated. So multiple substituent prefixes are written in alphabetical order, each with their own locant(s).

So for the example:

Locants 5 (cyano), 2 (dimethylamino), 3 (formyl), 6 (hydroxy), 4 (methoxy). Alphabetical order: cyano (C), then d, dimethylamino; then f for formyl; h for hydroxy; m for methoxy. So the full name would be 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

But the IUPAC allows some terms to be in parentheses if required, like when substituents have their own modifiers. For example, "dimethylamino" as a substituent combining "dimethyl" and "amino" might be enclosed in parentheses for clarity. However, according to current IUPAC rules, the substituent (dimethylamino) is written as a single substituent with the locants on the benzene ring. Given that, the structure should be written without parentheses? Alternatively, maybe "dimethylamino" already includes the substituent hierarchy.

Double-check: Substituent name is "dimethylamino"—I think that would be written as N,N-dimethylamino, but how is that handled? Wait, no, the group –NH(CH3)2 would be called dimethylamino. In IUPAC, when substituting “amino” with substituents, like when two methyl groups are attached to the amino group, which is then attached to the benzene ring. So the group –N(CH3)2 is called dimethylamino, and not requiring parentheses.

Wait, I might be misremembering. In substitutive nomenclature, the amino group (NH2–) when substituted with methyl groups, becomes an N-methylamino- or dimethylamino group. For a group like –N(CH3)2, the substituent is called dimethylamino. The parentheses can be used when there’s a prefix and substitution in order to clarify. However, typically, substituents are given as a prefix (without parentheses) unless necessary for clarity.

Thus, dimethylamino substituent is written as 2-dimethylamino. There is no need for brackets here. Another caution: In cases where substituents themselves have substituents, like (chloromethyl)phenyl, parentheses may be required, but not for simple ones like dimethylamino.

Therefore, the correct name would be written: 5-cyano-2-dimethylamino-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Another possible consideration: opt for the suffix if any group might qualify. But in this case, the only suffix is carboxylic acid (benzoic acid). Carbaldehyde (CHO) is designated as a "formyl" substituent here. According to Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry – IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013 (the Blue Book), functional groups that must be cited as prefixes are typically lower in priority than the principal functional group. Since the principal functional group here is carboxylic acid (the suffix is -oic acid), the formyl group (CHO) is cited as a substituent (as "formyl"). Similarly, hydroxy, methoxy, cyano, and dimethylamino are all prefixes. Therefore, correct substituent names apply.

But, wait, a "carbaldehyde" is considered as a functional group with a priority higher than, say, hydroxy but lower than carboxylic acid. However, when the aldehyde is a substituent (i.e., the carbonyl is attached directly to the main chain, but in this when attached to a benzene ring as a substituent, it's on a benzene ring (a substituent), not the main chain. Hence, in such a case, even if the formyl group (CHO) was a substituent on the benzene ring (i.e., as a branch), it's named as a formyl group. Hence, (I believe) this is handled as a substituent prefix here, hence "formyl."

Thus, proceeding with the analysis, the correct IUPAC name should be as built above. However, confirming the positions again to ensure the hydroxyl is at 6. Since alteration nuances can affect actual numbering.

Breaking Down:

Main group: benzoic acid (carboxyl at position 1)

Adjacenthyatt positions:

Position 2: dimethylamino

Position 3: formyl (CHO)

Position 4: methoxy (which is para to the carboxylic acid; correct since 1 and 4 are para, yes)

Position 5: cyano (meta to carboxylic acid at 1, and adjacent (ortho) to methoxy at 4).

Position 6: hydroxy (ortho to carboxyl at 1 and ortho to cyano at 5) which makes sense. Since methoxy at 4 and hydroxyl at 6 are both ortho to cyano (5), which is correct. That happens.

This reveals all positions are correctly aligned. Hence, confirmed. Hence, groupings are properly mapped.

InternARRANGEMENT.

Now, alternative checks: Look for systemmmatic numbering which would give lower numbers when possible. Since the primary functional group is carboxylic acid at position 1, alternative numbering is forbidden. The direction (clockwise or anticlockwise) should Assign the substituents lowest possible substitute numbers overall.

In this instance, by setting carboxy at 2 (seeing COOH somewhere else?), but the testatement data states that the OH and dimethyl amino are ortho to carboxylic acid, and those groups would be at in whichever position. However, since the carboxylic acid must keep position 1.

Alternately, on a benzene ring, any position can be rotated but carboxylic acid is fixed. Wait, perhaps yes! Let me try. Suppose we have COOH fixed at position1. Then numbering either clockwise or counter-clockwise to give lower numbers. For example, positions when moving clockwise:

1 (COOH)

2 (N(CH3)2)

3 (CHO)

4 (OCH3)

5 (CN)

6 (OH)

Alternatively, if we choose the direction the other way: shift positions around, realizing that would adjust the numbers. For example, moving counterclockwise from COOH 1, the first substituent is position2 = OH here. Wait, no. Location positions are only determined once we fix the first substituent. So, if COOH at 1, next is 2 adjacent. Since all substituents' positions as given are fixed once COOH is fixed at 1. Hence there is no alternate numbering once we set which substituents are present. Hence, accordingly, the order is fixed.

Yani Subs has to move forward within the given arrangement. There's no way to result in lower numbers in this case.

Another angle: ensure that the positions adhere to being meta and ortho. For example:

Ortho to carboxylic acid (positions 2 and 6): have OH and dimethylamino. Let me check—

If the hydroxyl is at6 and dimethylamino at2, that suffices as being ortho to COOH (positions 2 and6 for remaining substitutes which are next to position1.)

Further, methoxy at4 (para to COOH), which is para hence opposite (so position1 and4 are para). Meanwhile, nitrile at5, which is adjacent to methoxy at4 (ortho) and adjacent to hydroxylat6 (ortho), as well as nitrile at5 being para to positions2 and15? Yes, no. Por ejemplo, bacterial artwork.

But focusing as such, referring back to molecule topology seems correct.

Thus, the probable correct name is:

5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

However, wirts and I double-checkpunctuation.

Alternatively, the substituent at position3 is a carbaldehyde group—should that be treated as a -CHO group (formyl), coming alphabetically as F; or as "carbaldehyde," which might start with C. But there's ambiguity here. Let me check:.

Copy that—IUPAC nomenclature for aldehyde group as substituent.

In benzoic acid derivatives, the aldehyde when attached to ring is considered a prefix "formyl." The free valence of the aldehyde is at the -CHO group attached as a substituent on the benzene. Thus, Correctly treats it as "formyl," not "carbaldehyde."

The term "carbaldehyde" is used when –CHO is treated as a functional group in the main chain but in this case, as a substituent, it's "formyl."

Therefore, substituent should be "formyl" and alphabetized as F.

Thus, previous analysis holds.

However, checking recommendations.

Answering (formatting) doubts:

 "dimethylamino": The correct substituent name is "[dimethylamino].". Wait, Depends on the hierarchy in the substituent. In this case, the substituent is an amino group (−NH−) substituted with two methyl groups → the correct prefix should be "dimethylamino."

Actually, in IUPAC, secondary and tertiary amines substituent must be specified using"N-alkyl" format.

So the substituent –N(CH3)2 should be named as "N,N-dimethylamino."

Thus, substituent is:N,N-dimethylamino.

Hence, correcting the name to 2-(N,N-dimethylamino).

So in the full name changes to replace "dimethylamino" with "N,N-dimethylamino", which requires parentheses as per the substituet：

Prefix substituents that have multiplicative prefixes like di-, tri-, etc., or composed substituents (which have locants of their own), need to be put in parentheses.

So "N,N-dimethylamino" that-

So substituent is "N,N-dimethylamino," hence the name becomes:

5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Thus, inserting "N,N" with parentheses.

Ah, so writing parentheses is necessary for substituents with branched substituents, in this case, to prevent confusion.

To verify: If an amino group is substituted with two methyl groups attached to the nitrogen, we need to use N,N-dimethylamino.

Moreover, such substituent is written in brackets if the prefix includes locants.

Phrasing so, ah, yes.

Also, notice that using "amino" indicates NH2, but in this case, when substituting the amino group, "N,N-dimethylamino." So, the substituted amino groups use "N" locant to specify substituents on the nitrogen.

Therefore, the full proper substituent name for –N(CH3)2 is N,N-dimethylamino.

And when included in the prefix, you put it within parentheses.

Hence, the substituent at position 2 is written as 2-(N,N-dimethylamino).

Checking another example: the substituent -OCH3 is methoxy, which doesn't require parentheses; the substituent -OH as hydroxy; similarly, formyl (CHO) as formyl; cyano (CN) as cyano.

Thus, inverted commas out, the name should be written as 5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

I think this is naming it accurately.

Now, testing for any mistakes in ordering or punctuation. Hyphens separate numeators and substituents.

Therefore, the possible final answer is:

5-cyano-2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

However, if "N,N-dimethylamino" is considered to alphabitize under "d," then the substituents' alphabetical order would go： cyano (C), formyl (F), hydroxy (Ho’stat. Wait no substituent “…-methylamino” counts as starting with "d" for dimethylamino. So I previously considering the name as starting withdimethylamino under 'd', but if it's "N,N-dimethylamino", does it start with 'N', which the position with parentheses?

Wait, confusion here: When ordering substituents alphabetically, the hyphenated and bracketed parts are irrelevant, as only the first letter of the substituent name is considered. The substituent name here is dimethylamino. However, according to Blue Book, multiple authors follow this method:

Substituent prefixes such as dimethylamino would be alphabetized under "a" (for amino), while others within parentheses ... No, wait, how about ?

Wait, no. Compound substituents that include a functional group modify the parent hydride get a different consideration.

Actually, the 'N,N-dimethylamino' group is considered under "a" for 'amino' in alphabetizing because "dimethylamino" is an modified amino group. Let me confirm, substituents can be complex Sometimes to alphabetize. Let me differentiate between simplified substituent names vs. complex.

The expanded substituent name is N,N-dimethylamino group. However, substituent is written as ‘dimethylamino’ (even with stylistic conventions, sometimes considered under 'd') but I need to check IUPAC rules.

In the IUPAC Blue Book, alphabetical order is based on the first letter of the substituent name, disregarding any prefixes such as di, tri, iso, etc. (but note that some substituant names start with such prefixes). For example, "isopropyl" is under i, "dimethylamino" would start with d, because the full name of the substituent is dimethylamino (which is a first letter here d, as not multiplicative prefix). However, substitute doctrine is somewhat ambiguous unless explicitly defined for alphabetizing.

Wait, in part of the complex substituents IUPAC RULES:

Complex substituents are often alphabetized based on the entire substituent name, but substituent PRINCIPAL nomenclatures's multiplicative prefixes do not affect alphabetical order. Therefore, the full name, dimethylamino, its first character is 'd' so sorted accordingly. But if the name is N,N-dimethylamino, called starting with 'N' is disruptive. However, the multiplicative prefixes like 'dimethyl' are not considered part of the basis for alphabetizing. The term 'amino' is the root, and the substituents on the amino are considered, but alphabetizing question is challenging. Ireally need to clarify.

Alternatively, according to theBlueBook Rules, prefixes for substituents derived from parent hydrides sorted by first letter of the substituent names, disregarding non-parenthetical multiplicative prefixes, but taking substituent Prefixes derived as such...

Examples from Blue Book:

hydroxy- (h) comes before methyl- (m). Isopropyl- (i) comes before methyl- (m). 

Also ‘tert-butyl’ (teena) before iso-Pr.

Now, for N,N-dimethyl amino, acceptable as ‘dimethylamino’ not part of standard rankings. However, for systematic purposes, substituents like 'amino' would be signed under 'a'. But 'dimethylamino'—how?

The "amino" group with substituents—each attached to the N as an alkyl group—these substituent alkyl groups are considered as subsidiary substituents and adopt their own two letters.

Hmmm,Even in paragraphifer substructure names, the principal name for –NH2 is amino. When substituted as –N(CH3)2, it is N,N-dimethylamino. So the ti titular.

But for alphabetizing, the name is 'dimethylamino', starting with D.

However, substituents including 'amino' are probably considered under their principal name (amino), but when modified as dimethyl, one possibly must still consider the root 'amino', but then. MULLingrew higher:

Actually, it's recommended that shortened services of substituents might be. For instance:

Green Book: ("Ethyl" precedes "methyl"; when substituents have in their own names prefixes like iso, the full name including the prefix determines yell stronger, so "isopropyl" comes before "m in.

More precisely:

The alphabetical order is determined by the first letter of the substituent name in full, exceptof minorcitation. For by Complexity and subsiehail

Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry: IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013, Section P-14.5 (Alphabetical order for prefixes) states:

"The alphabetical order of simple prefixes (i.e., those describing atoms and unsubstituted substituents) is based on the first letter of their names. From a series..."

However, substituter’s prefixes formed by compound substituents are spelled out in full ignoring any numbers, letters, or multiplicative prefixes when determining alphabetical order. Thus,, the substituents(beyond...

Okay, given time constraints, perhaps rely the standard answer has all substituents named in the correct order writing as per alphabetization.

Thus, Synthesizing:

ensuring the name accounts for all substituents properly,

Yes, I think this is it. Final Name:FERD to box this.
