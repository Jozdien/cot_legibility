# Original Question

Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. 
The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

What Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector inner walls, we start by understanding the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the proper lifetime of the particles, and the probability of reaching the detector. 

The probability that a particle survives long enough to reach the detector walls is given by the exponential decay law:
\[ P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma \tau c}\right) \]
where \( R = 30 \) meters is the radius of the detector, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

Given that one-third of the particles reach the walls when \( \gamma = 20 \):
\[ \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{20 \tau c}\right) \]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ -\frac{30}{20 \tau c} = \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \]
\[ \frac{30}{20 \tau c} = \ln(3) \]
Solving for \( \tau \):
\[ \tau = \frac{30}{20 c \ln(3)} \]

Next, we need to find the Lorentz factor \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \) such that two-thirds of the particles reach the walls:
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau c}\right) \]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ -\frac{30}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau c} = \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \]
\[ \frac{30}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau c} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \]

Substituting \( \tau \) from the previous result:
\[ \gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{30}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \tau c} \]
\[ \gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{30 \cdot 20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \cdot 30} \]
\[ \gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)} \]

Using the values \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \):
\[ \gamma_{\text{new}} \approx \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.17 \]

Thus, the required Lorentz factor is approximately:
\[
\boxed{54}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls of the detector. Let's start by understanding the problem step by step. 

First, the situation: particles are created at the center of a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters. These particles travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, meaning their speed is close to the speed of light. Their Lorentz factor is currently around 20, and on average, one-third of them reach the detector's inner walls before decaying. The question is asking for the Lorentz factor required so that two-thirds of them reach the walls instead.

Let me recall the relation between Lorentz factor, lifetime, and distance traveled. The Lorentz factor γ is defined as γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For ultra-relativistic particles, v ≈ c, so we can approximate their speed as the speed of light, right? So maybe in calculations, we can take v = c since the error would be negligible. That would simplify things.

The particles have a proper lifetime τ (tau) in their rest frame. But due to time dilation, in the lab frame (detector frame), their lifetime is γτ. Therefore, the distance they can travel before decaying would be approximately d = v * γτ ≈ c * γτ. 

However, not all particles travel in the same direction. They are emitted isotropically from the center. So some go straight out, others at different angles. Since the detector is spherical, the maximum distance a particle has to travel to reach the wall is the radius, 30 meters. But depending on the direction, some particles will have a shorter path. For example, particles emitted directly towards the wall go 30 meters, whereas those emitted at an angle would have a longer path if the direction changes... Wait, no. Wait, in a sphere, the distance from the center to the wall is always the radius, regardless of direction. Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused here. Wait, the particles are created at the center, and the detector is spherical, so no matter what direction they go, the distance to the wall is the radius, which is 30 meters. Wait, no, if you are moving in any direction, once you leave the center, the distance to the closest wall is along the radial direction. Wait, hold on: for a spherical detector, if the particle is moving in any direction, doesn't that mean that the detector walls are at a radius of 30 meters all around? So the particle is moving along some direction, but the minimum distance to the wall (i.e., the radius) is 30 meters for all directions. Wait, perhaps not. If a particle is moving in a straight line from the center, then the length of the path until it exits the sphere is just the radius. However, if it's moving at some angle, the actual path length might be longer? No, if the particle is moving from the center of the sphere, then regardless of direction, the distance it has to travel to reach the wall is exactly the radius, right? Because from the center of a sphere, any straight line path to the surface is exactly the radius. For example, if you have a sphere with center O, and a point P on the surface, then the line OP is the radius vector and its length is R. So, any particle emitted from the center in any direction will have to travel exactly 30 meters to leave the sphere.

Wait, my mistake. Wait, if the particle is created at the center, then regardless of the direction, the path length to the edge of the sphere is 30 meters. So for all particles exiting the detector, moving in any direction, they will travel 30 meters from the center to hit the wall. Then only on the time they take to travel 30 meters. If they decay before that, they don't reach the wall. So the key point is: particles that decay after a time t where t >= (30 meters)/v will reach the wall. But since times are measured in their lab frame, t = (distance)/v ≈ (30 m)/c, since v ≈ c.

But the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. The proper lifetime is in the particle's rest frame. Therefore, the actual lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is t_lab = gamma * tau. So the distance they can travel before decaying is d = v * t_lab ≈ c * gamma tau. 

In order to reach the wall, it's required that d >= 30 m. Therefore, if c * gamma tau >= 30 m, then the particle will reach the wall. Otherwise, it decays before. 

Wait, but we are told that on average, one third of the particles reach the walls when gamma is ~20. So this must be using some statistical approach since maybe the decay time is exponential.

Wait, but wait, if we are considering an average, but all particles here have gamma approximately 20. Given that, but the problem does not mention any distribution of velocities or Lorentz factors, just saying that the Lorentz factor is "highly centered around ~20."

However, perhaps the proper approach here is to model the decay time as exponential. So for each particle, the probability that it lives long enough to reach the detector is the probability that its lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the time required to reach the wall. Given that the lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau, and the decay time follows an exponential distribution.

Right, exponential decay. The probability that a single particle lives longer than time t is exp(-t / (gamma tau)), because in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is gamma tau. But then, the required time to reach the wall is t = R / v. Since v is approx c, maybe t ≈ R / c. Then, the probability to reach the wall is P = exp(- (R / c) / (gamma tau)) )= exp( - R / (gamma tau c) ).

However, wait, is that the correct expression? So in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer by gamma. The decay is a Poisson process, right? So the decay probability as a function of time in lab frame should be dP/dt = (1/(gamma tau)) exp(-t/(gamma tau)). Then, the probability that the particle has not decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)). Hence, probability P = exp( - t / (gamma tau) ) ≈ exp( - (R / c ) / (gamma tau) )

Wait, but we have to account for the actual time each particle takes to exit. But since all particles have path length R =30 m, do they?

Wait, as I thought before, if they are all produced at the center, then their path length is exactly the 30 meters. So moving at v ≈ c, the time taken for any particle to reach the wall is t = R / c ≈ 30 m / 3e8 m/s ≈ 1e-7 seconds. Right? (30 / 3e8) = 1e-7 seconds = 100 nanoseconds. So in that case, the probability that the particle survives to reach the wall is exp( - (t) / (gamma tau) ) = exp( - (R / (c gamma tau )) )

But the problem says that on average, one third of the particles reach the detector walls. Which gives us:

exp( - R / (c gamma tau) ) = 1/3

When gamma is 20. So from this equation, we can solve for tau, the proper lifetime. Then, when gamma is increased, we set the probability to be 2/3, and solve for the new gamma.

But first, let's verify this approach.

Given that all particles have to move R =30 m to hit the wall. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times tau, hence after time t = R/c (the time to hit the wall), if gamma*tau* c is much longer than R, then more particles survive. So the survival probability is dependent on the ratio between lab-frame lifetime and the required time to reach the wall.

So, indeed, probability P = exp( - t / t_mean ), where t_mean is gamma tau. Therefore, P = exp( - ( R / c ) / (gamma tau) )

So rearranged, exp( - R / ( gamma tau c ) ) = P.

Given that when gamma=20, P=1/3, we can write:

exp( - 30 / (20 * tau * c) ) = 1/3

We can solve for tau. Let me calculate that. Take natural log of both sides:

-30 / (20 * tau * c) ) = ln(1/3 ) = -ln(3 )

Then:

30 / (20 * tau * c ) = ln(3 )

=> tau = 30 / (20 * c * ln(3) )

Compute the numerical value. Wait, but we maybe don't need the numerical value because it might cancel out when computing the new gamma. Let's see.

Now, we need to find gamma_new so that the survival probability is 2/3:

exp( - 30 / ( gamma_new * tau * c ) ) = 2/3

Take natural log:

- 30 / (gamma_new tau c ) = ln(2/3 ) = - ln(3/2 )

Thus,

30 / ( gamma_new tau c ) = ln(3/2 )

Therefore, gamma_new = 30 / ( ln(3/2) * tau c )

But from the first equation, tau = 30 / (20 * c * ln(3) )

Substitute this into the expression for gamma_new:

gamma_new = 30 / ( ln(3/2 ) * [30 / (20 * c * ln(3) )] * c )

Simplify. Let's compute denominator:

ln(3/2) * (30 / (20 * c * ln(3)) ) * c = ln(3/2) * (30 / (20 * ln(3) )) 

Because c cancels.

Thus, denominator = ( ln(3/2) * 30 ) / (20 * ln(3) )

So gamma_new = 30 / [ ( ln(3/2 ) * 30 ) / (20 * ln(3) ) ) ]

Cancel 30 numerator and denominator:

gamma_new = 1 / [ ( ln(3/2 ) / (20 * ln(3) ) ) ]

Which is gamma_new = (20 * ln(3) ) / ln(3/2 )

Compute this:

First, compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

Thus,

gamma_new ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055 ≈ (21.972) / 0.4055 ≈ 54.17. Hmm, approximately 54.2.

So the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2. But let me check if this is correct.

Wait, but let me do the exact calculation step-by-step:

Step 1: Original equation when gamma = 20:

exp( - R / ( gamma tau c ) ) = 1 / 3

From which we solve for tau:

- R / ( gamma tau c ) = ln(1/3 ) =>

 R / (gamma tau c ) = ln(3 )

Hence,

tau = R / ( gamma c ln(3) )

Therefore,

tau = 30 m / (20 * c * ln(3) )

Thus, the proper lifetime tau is known in terms of R, gamma, and c.

Then, when finding gamma_new such that P = 2/3:

exp( - R / ( gamma_new * tau * c ) ) = 2 /3

Similarly, solve for gamma_new.

Let's compute:

From above, we have:

gamma_new = R / ( tau c ln(3/2 ) )

But tau = R / (20 c ln(3) ) from the first part.

Thus,

gamma_new = R / [ ( R / (20 c ln(3) ) ) c ln(3/2) )

= R * 20 c ln(3) / ( R c ln(3/2) )

Cancel R and c:

gamma_new = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2 )

As we computed before, which evaluates numerically to about 54.17.

But can we write this ratio of logs as ln(3)/ln(3/2), multiplied by 20?

Yes, that's right.

So with numbers:

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

Hence, ratio ln(3)/ln(3/2 ) ≈ 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.708

So multiply by 20 gives 2.708 * 20 ≈ 54.17.

Therefore, the gamma needed is approximately 54.2.

But the problem states that initially, for Lorentz factor ~20, one third reach the walls. So our answer is ~54.

But perhaps there is also a thought to verify. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps we need to account for some spatial distribution? For example, the particles are emitted isotropically, so even though each particle's required path length is always 30 meters, is there something else? But wait, for a spherical detector, you being at the center, so emission is isotropic. But regardless of direction, from the center, all path lengths necessary to exit are R =30. So if all particles that live longer than t = R / c survive, their survival probability is exp(-t / gamma tau ). So with the above. Therefore, the approach was correct.

But the answer around 54 seems correct if no other complications. Let's check if gamma ≈54 gives survival probability 2/3.

Let me verify with that example.

So tau, computed from the first scenario, gamma =20:

tau = 30 / (20 c ln(3) ) approx.

Plugging in 30 m, c = 3e8 m/s

tau =30/(20*3e8*1.0986 )

tau ≈ 30/(20*3e8*1.0986)

= 30 / (6.5916e8 )

≈4.55e-9 seconds, so approximately 4.55 nanoseconds.

Then for gamma_new = 54.2:

Gamma-new times tau c =54.2 * 4.55e-9 s * 3e8 m/s

Multiply 54.2 * 4.55e-9 = 54.2 *4.55=246.11, then 246.11e-9 = 2.4611e-7.

Multiply by 3e8: 2.4611e-7 *3e8 ≈ 73.83 meters.

So the mean path length at gamma_new is about 73.83 meters, required to traverse only 30 meters. Therefore, survival probability is exp( -30 /73.83 )=exp(-0.406). Compute:

exp(-0.406)≈ e^-0.4 ≈ 0.67, so about 2/3. Rounded. So 67%, close to two-thirds. This checks out.

Wait, but exp(-0.406):

e^{-0.4} ≈ 0.6703

Since 0.406 is a bit more:

e^{-0.406} ≈0.667, which is 2/3 (0.666...)

Yes, perfect. So in that case, the calculation checks out. Therefore, the required gamma is approximately 54.2. So the problem mentions "highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20" which we can see, but not sure if they want order of magnitude of 50-60.

But perhaps I should check if this reasoning is correct. Let me ask another angle : suppose particles decay uniformly in time, so in their frame, and when observed from lab frame, is the derivation correct with exponential survival probability.

Each particle in its rest frame has average lifetime tau. The decay is exponential, so while in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. Thus, the exponential law still holds with mean lifetime gamma tau.

So yes, agreement here. Thus survival probability up to time t= R / c , which is R/(gamma tau c). Hence P= exp (- R/(gamma tau c)) So  yes. Since tau is fixed. The R is fixed, so to vary gamma so that P goes from 1/3 to 2/3.

But From 1/3 we have relation exp(-30/(20 tau c ))=1/3. Then we solve for tau, so tau must be 30/(20 c ln3 )

If I substitute that into the new Lorentz factor needed, we have found that gamma_new =20 ln3 / ln (3/2 )

Wait, perhaps we can write the expression as:

Given both equations:

Equation 1: exp(- R/(gamma1 * tau * c )) = P1

Equation 2: exp(- R/(gamma2 * tau * c )) = P2

Divide equation 2 by equation1: exp(- R/(gamma2 * tau c ) + R/(gamma1 * tau c )) = P2/P1

Take ln of both sides:

( R/(gamma1 tau c ) - R/(gamma2 tau c )) = ln(P2/P1 )

Factor R/(tau c ) [1/gamma1 -1/gamma2 ]= ln(P2/P1 )

But since tau= R/(gamma1 c ln(1/P1 )) from equation1:

At equation1, -R/(gamma1 tau c ) = ln P1 => tau= - R/(gamma1 c ln P1 )

Which is tau= R/(gamma1 c | ln P1 | )

So R/(tau c )=gamma1 | ln P1 |.

Thus, substituting R/(tau c ) = gamma1 |ln P1 | back into the equation above:

gamma1 |ln P1 | [1/gamma1 -1/gamma2 ]=ln P2 - ln P1

Simplify:

|ln P1 | ( 1 - gamma1 / gamma2 ) = ln (P2 / P1 )

Let suppose P1 =1/3, P2=2/3, so ln P1 = -ln3; | ln P1 |=ln3 >0.

Then:

ln3 (1 - gamma1/gamma2)= ln( (2/3)/(1/3) )= ln2 )

Thus,

1 - gamma1/gamma2= ln2 / ln3.

Therefore,

gamma1/gamma2=1 - ln2 / ln3 ≈1 - 0.6931/1.0986≈1 -0.6309≈0.3691

Thus,

gamma2= gamma1 /0.3691≈20 /0.3691≈54.19.

Therefore, same answer as before.

Hence, I believe this is the required result.

So the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54.2, round to maybe an integer, maybe 54 or 55, but as the problem states "about two thirds" and the original Lorentz factor is given "~20", as an approximate value, likely gamma ~55. But more precisely, the answer is (ln3 / ln(3/2 )) * gamma1 /?

Wait the exact ratio is gamma2 / gamma1= ln3 / ln(3/2 )

Since ln(3) / ln(3/2 )≈1.0986/0.4055≈2.709

Then gamma2 = gamma1 *2.709≈20*2.709≈54.18. So approximately 54.18. Hence \boxed{54}, if we need an integer, or since in the problem 20 is written as ~20, perhaps the answer is ~55. But should we use exact fraction?

The exact ratio is:

ln(3)/ln(3/2) = (ln 3)/(ln3 - ln2 )

So if we compute as63y7 ratios.

Also, 1/(ln(3/2)/ln3)= ln3/(ln3 - ln2 )

If mathematical needs.

But physics-wise, the calculated value is approximately double 20, about 54.2. Since the answer is two significant figures, (~20 in the problem), answer as 54. But problem says "highly centered around Lorentz factor ~20" so Gamma is around 20, and you need to compute required Gamma for two-thirds, so answering perhaps approximately double (~20 is like 20, so gammas higher. double is 40; but process gives 54. More accurately, double the Gamma would mean quadruple survival? No, because exponential is non-linear.

But we have gone through the proper derivation, my thought process. So probably 54.2 approximately, so perhaps the answer should be given as approximately 55. But maybe exact expression.

Alternatively, symbolically, gamma_new = gamma_old * ( ln3 / ln(3/2 ) )

But 20*( ln3 / ln(3/2 ) )

Exact expression is perhaps permissible.

But let me check units: Lorentz factor is unitless, so allright. Where the logarithms cancel units.

But this is necessary.

Alternatively, leave the answer as (20 ln3 ) / ln(1.5 )

Anyway, the final numerical answer is approximately 54.2, so if input to a box, will probably accept \boxed{54} but perhaps to one decimal place, \boxed{54.2}—depends on the problem. Since the initial parameter is ~20, a rough answer. But given the options, 54.2 would be the exact result, so as they say "about two thirds", input \boxed{55} may not be that off.

Alternatively, write the answer in terms of ln3 and ln(3/2 ), but since neither is standard, maybe present 54. So preferably, write \boxed{55}  54.2 closest integer. Or write the expression.

Wait, actually, possible possible problem?

Wait, but the initial calculation assumes that the only change is increasing gamma. If the detector is the same, R=30 m, but trying to find gamma so that two thirds survive instead of one third. Since it's all using the same reasoning, so the answer is 54.2. Perhaps indicated is needed to have two significant figures, as numbers. But in Phys.SE problems, often fractions of logs are involved but here since he asked explicit value will probably need number.

Wait the first state is the original Gamma ~20, the answer is Gamma ≈54， but in Chinese lazy slang "54" may replace "I.e.".

But in reality, answer is about 54, and if options aren't given, just providing \boxed{54} as the answer.

Unless alternatively, in calculation, let me confirm again the numbers.

Compute tau from the first equation:

 OK from gamma1=20, probability 1/3.

So 1/3= exp( -30/(20 * tau*c ) )

 so define tau*c= proper lifetime times speed. But tau*c is in units meters. Since c has units meters per second.

Wait, tau is in seconds, so tau*c is in meters. So meters per speed.

Wait, units check:Lambda=R/(gamma tau c ); R is meters, gauge by meters/(gamma tau c )

But γ is unitless, tau*c is meters. Hold on, wrong. Wait, c is meters per second, tau is seconds. Thus, tau*c is meters. Hence R divided by (gamma*tau*c ), so it's meters divided by (unitless * meters ) 1/(gamma)), therefore that equality: the argument of exp must be unitless. Wait, no: Wait, if Λ= R / (gamma tau c )

But R has units of meters,

gamma is unitless,

tau has units seconds,

c has units meters/seconds,

thus R in meters, gamma no units, tau*c is (seconds)*(meters/seconds)= meters.

Thus, R/(gamma tau c ) is (meters)/( unitless * meters )= 1/unitless, which is unitless. Correct. Thus unit checks out.

YEs.

So back to equations.

Calculate the actual values of tau, perhaps not necessary, as we found gamma_new=54.2.

So conclusion.

Final Answer: \boxed{54}  second thought, sometimes exams would prefer closest integer.

**Final Answer**
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{54}.

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the Lorentz factor required for approximately two-thirds of particles to reach the inner walls of the detector. Let me analyze this problem systematically.

The scenario involves particles generated at the center of a spherical detector with a 30-meter radius. These particles move at ultra-relativistic speeds, nearly matching the speed of light. Currently, with a Lorentz factor of about 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector walls before decaying. I need to find what Lorentz factor would allow two-thirds of them to reach the walls.

Let me review the relationship between Lorentz factor, lifetime, and travel distance. The Lorentz factor γ is defined as γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since these are ultra-relativistic particles with v ≈ c, we can approximate their velocity as the speed of light in calculations, which simplifies our approach.

The particles have a proper lifetime τ in their rest frame. Due to time dilation, their lifetime in the laboratory frame becomes γτ. Consequently, the distance they can travel before decaying would be approximately d = v * γτ ≈ c * γτ.

These particles are emitted isotropically from the center. Since the detector is spherical, regardless of which direction a particle travels, the distance to reach the wall is always the radius of 30 meters. This means that for any particle to reach the detector wall, it needs to travel exactly 30 meters from the center.

For a particle to reach the wall, it must not decay before traveling this distance. The time needed to travel 30 meters at nearly light speed is t = 30m/c. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is t_lab = γτ. Therefore, the distance a particle can travel before decaying is d = c * γτ.

For a particle to reach the wall, we need d ≥ 30m, which means c * γτ ≥ 30m.

We know that when γ is approximately 20, on average one-third of the particles reach the walls. This suggests we're dealing with a statistical distribution, possibly exponential decay.

Alright, I need to determine the Lorentz factor necessary for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls. Let’s analyze the problem methodically.

To begin, consider the scenario: particles are generated at the center of a spherical detector with a 30-meter radius. These particles move at ultra-relativistic speeds, nearly reaching the speed of light. Currently, their Lorentz factor is roughly 20, and typically, one-third manage to reach the detector’s inner surface before decaying. The goal is to find the Lorentz factor needed to increase this to two-thirds.

Let's revisit the relationship between the Lorentz factor, particle lifetime, and the distance traveled. The Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For ultra-relativistic particles, v is approximately c, so we can effectively consider their velocity as c, making the calculations simpler.

Each particle has a proper lifetime τ in its rest frame, which becomes γτ in the lab frame due to time dilation. Hence, the distance they can cover before decaying is roughly d = v * γτ ≈ c * γτ.

Particles are emitted isotropically from the center, thus traveling in various directions. Because the detector is spherical, the furthest distance a particle must travel to reach the wall is the radius, 30 meters. In any direction, whether directly or at an angle, the distance from the center to the wall remains 30 meters, since any straight-line path from the center to the sphere's surface equals the radius. Hence, every direction requires the particle to travel 30 meters to exit the sphere.

Therefore, a particle traveling straight from the center to the edge will traverse exactly 30 meters, regardless of its path. The crux is whether the particle decays after t ≥ (30 meters)/v to ensure it hits the wall. Here, since v ≈ c, we consider t ≈ (30 meters)/c.

Since a particle's lifetime in the lab frame is the product of γ and the proper lifetime τ, it travels d = v * γτ ≈ c * γτ before decaying. To reach the wall, it’s necessary that d ≥ 30 meters, thus ensuring c * γτ ≥ 30 meters.

It’s noted that with a Lorentz factor of approximately 20, one-third of particles reach the walls. This observation likely involves a statistical element because decay time can be exponential.

Considering this, when averaging with each particle at γ about 20...

So perhaps the answer lies in the probability that the particle\'s lifetime is sufficient to reach the wall.\n\nBut for decay probabilities, in particle physics, the decay is a stochastic process with an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle survives for time t is exp(-t / t_lab), where t_lab is the mean lifetime in that frame, i.e., gamma tau.\n\nBut given that, in order for a particle to reach the wall, the required time to reach the wall is t_wall = 30 m / (v). Since v ≈ c, then t_wall ≈ 30 / c. \n\nTherefore, the probability that the particle reaches the wall is P = exp(-t_wall / t_lab) = exp(- (30 / (c gamma tau)) * (1 / gamma))? Wait, no, wait. Let\'s get that straight. Let me clarify:\n\nThe lab frame lifetime is t_lab = gamma tau. The time needed to reach the wall is t_wall = 30 / c. The decay probability is exponential, so the survival probability is exp(-t_wall / t_lab) = exp( - 30 / (c gamma tau) ). Therefore, the probability that a particle survives to reach the wall is exp(-30 / (c gamma tau)).\n\nNow, we are told that for gamma = 20, the average fraction of particles reaching the walls is 1/3. So:\n\n1/3 = exp( -30 / (c * 20 tau) )\n\nTaking natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(1/3) = -30 / (c * 20 tau).\n\nTherefore,\n\n30 / (c * 20 tau) = -ln(1/3) = ln(3)\n\nHence,\n\ntau = 30 / (c * 20 * ln(3)).\n\nThus, we can compute tau from here.\n\nNow, the question asks: What Lorentz factor gamma\' is needed for the survival probability to be two-thirds instead of one-third?\n\nThat is,\n\n2/3 = exp( -30/(c gamma\' tau) )\n\nSo we can set:\n\nln(2/3) = - 30 / (c gamma\' tau )\n\nBut we know from above that 30/(c tau) = 20 * gamma* ln(3). So plugging this:\n\n30/(c gamma\' tau) = (20 ln(3)) / gamma\'\n\nHence,\n\nln(2/3) = - (20 ln(3)) / gamma\'\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n- ln(2/3) = 20 ln(3) / gamma\'\n\nCompute left-hand side:\n\n- ln(2/3) = ln(3/2).\n\nTherefore,\n\nln(3/2) = 20 ln(3)/gamma\'\n\nSolving for gamma\':\n\ngamma\' = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2)\n\nCompute this value.\n\nFirst compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.\n\nCompute 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18.\n\nHence, gamma\' ≈ 54.18.\n\nTherefore, approximately gamma ~ 55.\n\nWait, but should we check units here? The value tau is computed as:\n\ntau = 30 / (c * 20 * ln(3)),\n\nBut since 30 meters divided by (c ~ 3e8 m/s * 20 * ln(3)),\n\nTau would be 30 / (3e8 * 20 * 1.0986) = 30 / (6.5916e9) ≈ 4.55e-9 seconds, which is 4.55 nanoseconds. \n\nBut this seems reasonable because particles like pions have lifetimes around tens of nanoseconds, but depending on the type. \n\nBut anyway, perhaps in the problem tau cancels out.\n\nBut the solution process didn\'t actually use tau beyond expressing how it relates the known gamma=20 and the desired gamma. Hence, we can perhaps forgo calculation of tau and directly relate the two probabilities.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nIn the initial scenario (gamma1 = 20), P1 = 1/3 = exp(-30/(c gamma1 tau))\n\nIn the desired scenario (gamma2 = ?), P2 = 2/3 = exp(-30/(c gamma2 tau))\n\nTake the ratio:\n\nln(P2)/ln(P1) = [ (-30/(c gamma2 tau)) ] / [ (-30/(c gamma1 tau)) ] = gamma1/gamma2\n\nTherefore,\n\nln(2/3)/ln(1/3) = gamma1 / gamma2\n\nCompute ln(2/3) ≈ ln(0.6667) ≈ -0.4055\n\nln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986\n\nThus,\n\n(-0.4055)/(-1.0986) = gamma1 / gamma2 => \n\n≈ 0.369 ≈ 20 / gamma2\n\nTherefore gamma2 ≈ 20 / 0.369 ≈ 54.2\n\nSo the answer is approximately 54.2, which is consistent with the previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, gamma factor should be approximately 54.\n\nBut let me check to make sure. So if gamma increases, the lifetime in lab frame increases, leading to higher survival probability? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait if gamma is higher, the lifetime (from the lab frame\'s perspective) is gamma * tau, so larger, hence greater survival probability?\n\nWait but in our formula, higher gamma leads to 30/(c gamma tau) being smaller (because gamma is in denominator). Thus, the argument of the exponential is smaller in magnitude, so exp(-x) is larger. Therefore yes, a higher gamma implies a higher survival probability.\n\nBut in the problem, when we\'re increasing the fraction of particles reaching from 1/3 to 2/3, so gamma should be higher. Therefore my calculation of ~54 seems correct. To confirm:\n\nOriginal setup: gamma = 20, P = 1/3.\n\ngamma=54: Then, same as above equation: calculate arg = -30 / (c gamma tau). From the first case, we have 30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3)\n\nTherefore, arg = - (20 ln(3)) / gamma = - (20 * 1.0986)/54.2 ≈ -(21.972)/54.2 ≈ -0.405. So exp(-0.405) ≈ 0.667 ≈ 2/3. Correct. Therefore, OK. So with gamma ≈54.2, the survival probability is indeed ~2/3.\n\nHence, the answer is approximately 54.\n\nBut the problem says "about two thirds", so either approximate number, maybe 55 or 54, depending on precise calculation.\n\nBut perhaps exact value uses more precise exponents. Let me compute this with more precise numbers.\n\nFirst, let\'s compute ln(3) ≈ 1.098612289\n\nln(3/2) ≈ 0.4054651081\n\nThen 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2) = 20 * 1.098612289 / 0.4054651081\n\nCompute numerator: 20 * 1.098612289 ≈ 21.97224578\n\nDivide by 0.4054651081: 21.97224578 / 0.4054651081 ≈ 54.185\n\nSo about 54.185, approximately 54.2. So rounding to a reasonable figure, since the initial gamma is ~20 (so one significant figure?), but the problem mentions ~20. Maybe the answer should be rounded to two significant figures? 54.185 becomes approximately 54, but maybe written as 55.\n\nAlternatively, in hep-ex (high energy physics), they might give as an integer, so 54 or 55.\n\nBut maybe the precise calculation comes to 54.\n\nAlternatively, could derive using exponents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that there\'s a simple relation. Since we have from exponent:\n\nWhen P = 1/3, and gamma =20.\n\nIf I need P = 2/3, which is doubling the probability. But given that survival probability is exp(-k/gamma), where k is a constant, then to go from exp(-k/20) = 1/3, we have exp(-k/gamma\') = 2/3. So need to solve for gamma\'.\n\nBut even using this approach, same as above:\n\ngamma\' = k / (-ln(2/3))\n\nBut k can be solved as gamma * ln(P) from first case. So k = - gamma * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3). Therefore,\n\ngamma\' = 20 * ln(3) / (-ln(2/3)) ) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2). Same as before. So still approximately 54.2.\n\nTherefore, i think that safely, the answer is approximately 54.\n\nBut let me check with another angle. Let me assume the problem is intended to be more on geometric understanding.\n\nThe reasoning process:\n\nThe fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on the ratio between the detector radius and the decay length (c * gamma tau). If gamma is 20, the decay length is L = c * 20 tau. If a particle must travel R = 30 m to reach the walls, then the probability of decay before 30 m is 1 - exp(-R / L) = 1 - exp(-30/(20 c tau)). And the problem says 1 - 1/3 = 2/3, so perhaps not... Hmm, wait in this case the survival probability is exp(-R/(c gamma tau)), so if current survival prob is 1/3, then indeed exp(-30/(c *20 tau)) = 1/3, correct. Then if I want survival probability 2/3, need exp(-30/(c gamma tau))= 2/3. \n\nActually that would be the inverse. Wait no: Survival probability is surviving to reach the wall. So if particles live for longer, larger gamma, then the decay length is longer, hence more particles reach the wall. So higher survival prob requires higher gamma.\n\nBut work again with the ratio:\n\nGiven P1 = 1/3 for gamma1=20.\n\nWe need P2=2/3 for gamma2=?\n\nWe can find the ratio:\n\nln(P2)/ln(P1) = ( - R/(c gamma2 tau) ) / ( - R/(c gamma1 tau) ) = gamma1 / gamma2\n\nSo ln(P2)/ln(P1) = gamma1 / gamma2, so gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(P1)/ln(P2)\n\nBut with the negative signs cancelling.\n\nTherefore,\n\ngamma2 = gamma1 * ln(P1)/ ln(P2)\n\nSo ln(P1) is ln(1/3), ln(P2) = ln(2/3). Then,\n\ngamma2 = 20 * (ln(1/3)/ln(2/3))\n\nAgain,\n\nCompute (ln(1/3)/ln(2/3)) = (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) ≈ 2.7094\n\nTherefore,\n\ngamma2 ≈ 20 * 2.7094 ≈ 54.19\n\nHence, same result as previous. So all paths lead to ~54.\n\nHence, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54. Since exact value is about 54.2, but given the problem states Lorentz factor ~20, which itself is approximate, and answer expected approximate, likely 55 or 54. Maybe note that two-third is double of one-third, but logarithmicaly.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 54.2, which is approximately 55 or 54, probably written as ~55.\n\nBut given setup with initial Lorentz factor ~20, maybe they expect ~55.\n\nBut per precise calculation, it\'s approximately 54.2. Let me see:\n\nIf you need 2/3 chance, ln(2/3)= -0.405 as done earlier. Then 20 * ln(3) = if ln(3)=1.0986, then that\'s 21.972.\n\nln(3/2)= 0.405, This divide 21.972/0.405= 54.2.\n\nHence, 54.2. So writing 54.2.\n\nBut likely written as 55.\n\nBut maybe check with precise calculator:\n\nLet me compute ln(3) = 1.09861228866811,\n\nln(3/2)=0.4054651081081644,\n\n20 * 1.09861228866811 / 0.4054651081081644\n\nCompute exact:\n\n20*1.09861228866811 = 21.9722457733622.\n\nDivide by 0.4054651081081644:\n\n21.9722457733622 / 0.4054651081081644 = \n\nCalculate exactly step-by-step:\n\nDivide 21.9722457733622 by 0.4054651081081644.\n\n0.4054651081081644 * 50 = 20.2732554, which is less than 21.972245...\n\nCompute 54 * 0.4054651081081644 = 54*0.405… let\'s compute:\n\n50 * 0.405…=20.273… and 4*0.405=1.619, total 21.893.\n\nBut 54 *0.4054651081081644 = 21.893…\n\nCompare to 21.972…\n\nSo 21.972 -21.893=0.079 is the remainder.\n\n0.079 / 0.405…≈ 0.195. Therefore, total gamma is 54.195, so 54.195, thus 54.2. Hence closer to 54.2.\n\nSo answer approximately 54.\n\nBut given the original gamma is given as ~20 (i.e., approximate to the nearest 5 or 10?), perhaps no need for decimal. However in experimental physics, you may prefer to put as integer ~54, but likely the precise answer would expect maybe taking two-thirds and 30 meters. Wait wait, hang on. Let\'s make sure:\n\nAre there any assumptions we are missing?\n\nWait, going back to the problem, particles are created at the center, detector is spherical with radius 30 meters, particles travel ultra-relativistically, so velocity ~c.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector inner walls, we start by understanding the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the radius of the detector, and the survival probability of the particles.

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Radius of the detector, \( R = 30 \) meters.
   - Initial Lorentz factor, \( \gamma_1 = 20 \).
   - Survival probability with \( \gamma_1 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

2. **Key Formula**:
   - The survival probability \( P \) is given by the exponential decay formula:
     \[
     P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{c \gamma \tau}\right)
     \]
   - Here, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

3. **Using Initial Conditions**:
   - For \( \gamma_1 = 20 \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \tau}\right)
     \]
   - Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \tau}
     \]
   - Solving for \( \tau \):
     \[
     \frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \tau} = \ln(3) \implies \tau = \frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \ln(3)}
     \]

4. **New Lorentz Factor Calculation**:
   - Desired survival probability \( \frac{2}{3} \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \gamma_2 \tau}\right)
     \]
   - Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \gamma_2 \tau}
     \]
   - Substituting \( \tau \) from the initial conditions:
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30 \cdot c \cdot 20 \cdot \ln(3)}{c \gamma_2 \cdot 30}
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{20 \ln(3)}{\gamma_2}
     \]
   - Solving for \( \gamma_2 \):
     \[
     \gamma_2 = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{-\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)}
     \]
   - Using approximate values for the natural logarithms:
     \[
     \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \quad \text{and} \quad \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055
     \]
     \[
     \gamma_2 \approx \frac{20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.2
     \]

Thus, the Lorentz factor needed to have about two-thirds of the particles reaching the detector inner walls is approximately \(\boxed{54}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

tw, the original statement says "highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20", so maybe we can approximate that all particles have gamma=20?

Alternatively, if their velocities are highly centered around gamma=20, such that their gamma varies little around 20, in that case, how can only one third reach the walls? So perhaps the answer lies in the probability that the particle's lifetime is sufficient to reach the wall.

But for decay probabilities, in particle physics, the decay is a stochastic process with an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle survives for time t is exp(-t / t_lab), where t_lab is the mean lifetime in that frame, i.e., gamma tau.

But given that, in order for a particle to reach the wall, the required time to reach the wall is t_wall = 30 m / (v). Since v ≈ c, then t_wall ≈ 30 / c. 

Therefore, the probability that the particle reaches the wall is P = exp(-t_wall / t_lab) = exp(- (30 / (c gamma tau)) * (1 / gamma))? Wait, no, wait. Let's get that straight. Let me clarify:

The lab frame lifetime is t_lab = gamma tau. The time needed to reach the wall is t_wall = 30 / c. The decay probability is exponential, so the survival probability is exp(-t_wall / t_lab) = exp( - 30 / (c gamma tau) ). Therefore, the probability that a particle survives to reach the wall is exp(-30 / (c gamma tau)).

Now, we are told that for gamma = 20, the average fraction of particles reaching the walls is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp( -30 / (c * 20 tau) )

Taking natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30 / (c * 20 tau).

Therefore,

30 / (c * 20 tau) = -ln(1/3) = ln(3)

Hence,

tau = 30 / (c * 20 * ln(3)).

Thus, we can compute tau from here.

Now, the question asks: What Lorentz factor gamma' is needed for the survival probability to be two-thirds instead of one-third?

That is,

2/3 = exp( -30/(c gamma' tau) )

So we can set:

ln(2/3) = - 30 / (c gamma' tau )

But we know from above that 30/(c tau) = 20 * gamma* ln(3). So plugging this:

30/(c gamma' tau) = (20 ln(3)) / gamma'

Hence,

ln(2/3) = - (20 ln(3)) / gamma'

Multiply both sides by -1:

- ln(2/3) = 20 ln(3) / gamma'

Compute left-hand side:

- ln(2/3) = ln(3/2).

Therefore,

ln(3/2) = 20 ln(3)/gamma'

Solving for gamma':

gamma' = 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2)

Compute this value.

First compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986, ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

Compute 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18.

Hence, gamma' ≈ 54.18.

Therefore, approximately gamma ~ 55.

Wait, but should we check units here? The value tau is computed as:

tau = 30 / (c * 20 * ln(3)),

But since 30 meters divided by (c ~ 3e8 m/s * 20 * ln(3)),

Tau would be 30 / (3e8 * 20 * 1.0986) = 30 / (6.5916e9) ≈ 4.55e-9 seconds, which is 4.55 nanoseconds. 

But this seems reasonable because particles like pions have lifetimes around tens of nanoseconds, but depending on the type. 

But anyway, perhaps in the problem tau cancels out.

But the solution process didn't actually use tau beyond expressing how it relates the known gamma=20 and the desired gamma. Hence, we can perhaps forgo calculation of tau and directly relate the two probabilities.

Alternative approach:

In the initial scenario (gamma1 = 20), P1 = 1/3 = exp(-30/(c gamma1 tau))

In the desired scenario (gamma2 = ?), P2 = 2/3 = exp(-30/(c gamma2 tau))

Take the ratio:

ln(P2)/ln(P1) = [ (-30/(c gamma2 tau)) ] / [ (-30/(c gamma1 tau)) ] = gamma1/gamma2

Therefore,

ln(2/3)/ln(1/3) = gamma1 / gamma2

Compute ln(2/3) ≈ ln(0.6667) ≈ -0.4055

ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986

Thus,

(-0.4055)/(-1.0986) = gamma1 / gamma2 => 

≈ 0.369 ≈ 20 / gamma2

Therefore gamma2 ≈ 20 / 0.369 ≈ 54.2

So the answer is approximately 54.2, which is consistent with the previous calculation.

Therefore, gamma factor should be approximately 54.

But let me check to make sure. So if gamma increases, the lifetime in lab frame increases, leading to higher survival probability? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait if gamma is higher, the lifetime (from the lab frame's perspective) is gamma * tau, so larger, hence greater survival probability?

Wait but in our formula, higher gamma leads to 30/(c gamma tau) being smaller (because gamma is in denominator). Thus, the argument of the exponential is smaller in magnitude, so exp(-x) is larger. Therefore yes, a higher gamma implies a higher survival probability.

But in the problem, when we're increasing the fraction of particles reaching from 1/3 to 2/3, so gamma should be higher. Therefore my calculation of ~54 seems correct. To confirm:

Original setup: gamma = 20, P = 1/3.

gamma=54: Then, same as above equation: calculate arg = -30 / (c gamma tau). From the first case, we have 30/(c tau) = 20 ln(3)

Therefore, arg = - (20 ln(3)) / gamma = - (20 * 1.0986)/54.2 ≈ -(21.972)/54.2 ≈ -0.405. So exp(-0.405) ≈ 0.667 ≈ 2/3. Correct. Therefore, OK. So with gamma ≈54.2, the survival probability is indeed ~2/3.

Hence, the answer is approximately 54.

But the problem says "about two thirds", so either approximate number, maybe 55 or 54, depending on precise calculation.

But perhaps exact value uses more precise exponents. Let me compute this with more precise numbers.

First, let's compute ln(3) ≈ 1.098612289

ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4054651081

Then 20 ln(3) / ln(3/2) = 20 * 1.098612289 / 0.4054651081

Compute numerator: 20 * 1.098612289 ≈ 21.97224578

Divide by 0.4054651081: 21.97224578 / 0.4054651081 ≈ 54.185

So about 54.185, approximately 54.2. So rounding to a reasonable figure, since the initial gamma is ~20 (so one significant figure?), but the problem mentions ~20. Maybe the answer should be rounded to two significant figures? 54.185 becomes approximately 54, but maybe written as 55.

Alternatively, in hep-ex (high energy physics), they might give as an integer, so 54 or 55.

But maybe the precise calculation comes to 54.

Alternatively, could derive using exponents.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed such that there's a simple relation. Since we have from exponent:

When P = 1/3, and gamma =20.

If I need P = 2/3, which is doubling the probability. But given that survival probability is exp(-k/gamma), where k is a constant, then to go from exp(-k/20) = 1/3, we have exp(-k/gamma') = 2/3. So need to solve for gamma'.

But even using this approach, same as above:

gamma' = k / (-ln(2/3))

But k can be solved as gamma * ln(P) from first case. So k = - gamma * ln(1/3) = 20 * ln(3). Therefore,

gamma' = 20 * ln(3) / (-ln(2/3)) ) = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2). Same as before. So still approximately 54.2.

Therefore, i think that safely, the answer is approximately 54.

But let me check with another angle. Let me assume the problem is intended to be more on geometric understanding.

The reasoning process:

The fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on the ratio between the detector radius and the decay length (c * gamma tau). If gamma is 20, the decay length is L = c * 20 tau. If a particle must travel R = 30 m to reach the walls, then the probability of decay before 30 m is 1 - exp(-R / L) = 1 - exp(-30/(20 c tau)). And the problem says 1 - 1/3 = 2/3, so perhaps not... Hmm, wait in this case the survival probability is exp(-R/(c gamma tau)), so if current survival prob is 1/3, then indeed exp(-30/(c *20 tau)) = 1/3, correct. Then if I want survival probability 2/3, need exp(-30/(c gamma tau))= 2/3. 

Actually that would be the inverse. Wait no: Survival probability is surviving to reach the wall. So if particles live for longer, larger gamma, then the decay length is longer, hence more particles reach the wall. So higher survival prob requires higher gamma.

But work again with the ratio:

Given P1 = 1/3 for gamma1=20.

We need P2=2/3 for gamma2=?

We can find the ratio:

ln(P2)/ln(P1) = ( - R/(c gamma2 tau) ) / ( - R/(c gamma1 tau) ) = gamma1 / gamma2

So ln(P2)/ln(P1) = gamma1 / gamma2, so gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(P1)/ln(P2)

But with the negative signs cancelling.

Therefore,

gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(P1)/ ln(P2)

So ln(P1) is ln(1/3), ln(P2) = ln(2/3). Then,

gamma2 = 20 * (ln(1/3)/ln(2/3))

Again,

Compute (ln(1/3)/ln(2/3)) = (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) ≈ 2.7094

Therefore,

gamma2 ≈ 20 * 2.7094 ≈ 54.19

Hence, same result as previous. So all paths lead to ~54.

Hence, the required Lorentz factor is approximately 54. Since exact value is about 54.2, but given the problem states Lorentz factor ~20, which itself is approximate, and answer expected approximate, likely 55 or 54. Maybe note that two-third is double of one-third, but logarithmicaly.

Therefore, I think the answer is 54.2, which is approximately 55 or 54, probably written as ~55.

But given setup with initial Lorentz factor ~20, maybe they expect ~55.

But per precise calculation, it's approximately 54.2. Let me see:

If you need 2/3 chance, ln(2/3)= -0.405 as done earlier. Then 20 * ln(3) = if ln(3)=1.0986, then that's 21.972.

ln(3/2)= 0.405, This divide 21.972/0.405= 54.2.

Hence, 54.2. So writing 54.2.

But likely written as 55.

But maybe check with precise calculator:

Let me compute ln(3) = 1.09861228866811,

ln(3/2)=0.4054651081081644,

20 * 1.09861228866811 / 0.4054651081081644

Compute exact:

20*1.09861228866811 = 21.9722457733622.

Divide by 0.4054651081081644:

21.9722457733622 / 0.4054651081081644 = 

Calculate exactly step-by-step:

Divide 21.9722457733622 by 0.4054651081081644.

0.4054651081081644 * 50 = 20.2732554, which is less than 21.972245...

Compute 54 * 0.4054651081081644 = 54*0.405… let's compute:

50 * 0.405…=20.273… and 4*0.405=1.619, total 21.893.

But 54 *0.4054651081081644 = 21.893…

Compare to 21.972…

So 21.972 -21.893=0.079 is the remainder.

0.079 / 0.405…≈ 0.195. Therefore, total gamma is 54.195, so 54.195, thus 54.2. Hence closer to 54.2.

So answer approximately 54.

But given the original gamma is given as ~20 (i.e., approximate to the nearest 5 or 10?), perhaps no need for decimal. However in experimental physics, you may prefer to put as integer ~54, but likely the precise answer would expect maybe taking two-thirds and 30 meters. Wait wait, hang on. Let's make sure:

Are there any assumptions we are missing?

Wait, going back to the problem, particles are created at the center, detector is spherical with radius 30 meters, particles travel ultra-relativistically, so velocity ~c. Lorentz factor gamma is initially ~20, average one third reach detector walls.

We have used the survival probability via exponential decay to find the dependence, which is P = exp(-R/(c gamma tau)), ok.

But in the problem, when gamma increases by a certain factor, then R/(c gamma tau) decreases by that factor, so the probability increases.

By equating the two probabilities (for the old and new Lorentz factors), and solving, we obtained gamma ~54. So I believe that's the correct approach.

Thus, the answer should be approximately 54. For the purposes of boxed answer, \boxed{54}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{54}

Therefore, the argument of the exponential becomes - (30 / c) / (γτ) = -30/(c γ τ).\n\nWait, that seems different from how I thought earlier. Let me check again.\n\nYes, Survival probability in lab frame is probability that the particle lives longer than time t, which requires:\n\nt_decay > t = 30 / v ≈ 30 / c\n\nSo the survival probability is exp(- t / t_lab), where t_lab = γ τ.\n\nTherefore, P = exp(- t / (γ τ)).\n\nBut t is 30 / c.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nP = exp( - (30)/(c γ τ) )\n\nBut wait, that gives Survival probability exp(-30/(c γ τ)) ?\n\nBut how do we connect this with the given data? Let\'s recap.\n\nOriginal scenario: Lorentz factor is γ1 = 20, survival probability P1 = 1/3.\n\nWe need to find γ2 such that survival probability P2 = 2/3.\n\nAssuming that τ is a fixed proper lifetime for the particles, and c is constant. The key is that the survival probability depends inversely on the Lorentz factor. Because as the Gamma increases, the lifetime in the lab frame t_lab = γ τ increases, so particles live longer, thus have higher survival probability.\n\nWait, if the Survival probability P = exp(- t / (γ τ)), then higher γ means exponent’s magnitude is smaller, so exp(-something smaller) ~ 1 - something, which would approach 1.\n\nBut in the original case, P1 =1/3, which means exponent is - ln(1/3) ≈ 1.0986.\n\nSo,\n\n1.0986 ≈ (30/(c τ)) / γ1\n\nSimilarly, for the new case:\n\nTo get P2 =2/3, the exponent needs to be -ln(2/3) ≈ -(-0.4055) ≈ 0.4055.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, if Survival probability P = exp(- t / (γ τ)), so if for the original case exp(- t / (γ1 τ)) = 1/3.\n\nThen, t/(γ1 τ) = - ln(1/3) ≈ 1.0986\n\nLet me write: corresponding value for 1/3\n\nEquation (1):\n\n(30)/(c * γ1 * τ) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.\n\nSimilarly, in the desired case of 2/3 survival:\n\nexp( - (30) / (c * γ2 * τ) ) = 2/3\n\nTaking natural log: - (30)/(c γ2 τ) = ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055.\n\nHence:\n\n(30)/(γ2 τ c) ≈ 0.4055.\n\nBut equation (1) gives:\n\n(30)/(γ1 τ c) ≈ 1.0986.\n\nThus, dividing equation (2) by equation (1):\n\n[ (30)/(γ2 τ c) ] / [ (30)/(γ1 τ c) ] = 0.4055 / 1.0986\n\nThe left side is (γ1 / γ2), thus:\n\nγ1 / γ2 ≈ 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369\n\nSo γ2 ≈ γ1 / 0.369 ≈ 20 / 0.369 ≈ 54.2.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that a Lorentz factor of approximately 54 would be needed to increase the survival probability from 1/3 to 2/3.\n\nBut is there something missing? Yes, probably need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states "new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20"; so we can assume that all moving particles have the same lorentz factor? Then, as being ultra-relativistic, velocity v ≈ c, but proper lifetime tau. The difference is when Lorentz factors are higher, so the lifetime in lab frame is higher by gamma, so particles live longer, thus more reaching.\n\nFrom the initial condition:\n\nAt current gamma (~20), 1/3 reach.\n\nAt desired gamma (gamma_?), 2/3 reach.\n\nAssuming that when they travel distance d = beta*gamma*c*tau.\n\nBut because particles move at ultrarelativistic speeds, beta ≈ 1, so d ≈ gamma*c*tau.\n\nDistance needed: 30 m.\n\nSo, Probability to survive is p = exp( -d/(gamma*c tau) ), but d ~ gamma c tau * t / tau?\n\nWait, maybe need to clarify again.\n\nThe proper lifetime is tau, so lab frame lifetime is gamma tau.\n\nThe needed time to reach the wall is t = d / v ≈ d / c when v ≈ c.\n\nIf in lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so the survival probability (probability that t < gamma tau) is the same as the probability that the particle lifetime T satisfies T > t.\n\nSince the decay follows an exponential distribution, p = exp( -t / (gamma tau) )\n\nAnd in order to have p =1/3, which gives t / (gamma tau) = ln(3). Which rearranged, gamma tau = t / ln(3)\n\nThen, for desired p =2/3 , we have t / (gamma\' tau) = ln(3/2). So t/(gamma\' tau)) = ln(2/3^{-1}) which if ln(3/2).\n\nSo yes, same path as before.\n\nBut proceeding:\n\nOriginal gamma, gamma1 = 20.\n\ngamma1 * tau = t / ln(3)\n\nNot sure.\n\nActually,\n\nFrom the given survival probability:\n\nFirst scenario,\n\nexp( - t / (gamma1 * tau) ) = 1/3\n\n=> t / ( gamma1 * tau ) = ln(3)\n\n=> tau = t / (gamma1 * ln(3))\n\nIn the second scenario,\n\nexp( - t / (gamma2 * tau) ) = 2/3\n\n=> t / (gamma2 * tau) = ln( (2/3)^{-1} ) ? Wait or the way I did before:\n\nWait for survival probability P = 2/3. The survival probability is the probability of the lifetime in lab frame exceeding t. So if we set:\n\nP = exp( - t / (gamma2 tau) )\n\nHence, take log both sides,\n\nln(2/3) = - t / (gamma2 tau )\n\nBut from first case, Hmmm, the key is to relate the two gamma values.\n\nWe can express tau from first scenario:\n\ngamma1 tau = - t / ln(1/3 )\n\nFrom original case. Because take natural log of 1/3:\n\nln(1/3) = - ln(3) = - t/(gamma1 tau )\n\nHence,\n\ngamma1 tau = t / ln(3)\n\nThus, tau = t / (gamma1 ln(3))\n\nThen moving to the second scenario,\n\nwe need gamma2 such that,\n\nexp( - t / (gamma2 tau )) = 2/3\n\nSubstitute tau from above,\n\nWe have,\n\n-t / ( gamma2 * [ t / (gamma1 ln(3)) ]) = ln(2/3 )\n\nSimplify,\n\n- (gamma1 ln(3) ) / gamma2 = ln(2/3 )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1,\n\ngamma1 ln(3) / gamma2 = - ln(2/3 ) = ln(3/2 )\n\nThus,\n\ngamma2 = (gamma1 ln(3)) / ln(3/2 )\n\nGiven gamma1 =20\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\ngamma1 * ln(3) ≈ 20*1.0986 ≈ 21.972\n\nDenominator: ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055\n\nGamma2 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ approximately 54.17\n\nSo approximately 54.17. So rounded, we can say γ ≈ 54.\n\nSo requires Lorentz factor about 54.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? For instance utting all concepts aside and reasoning statistically on the distance required.\n\nIn origin，probability of reachings 1/3. At gamma1=20, on average, the proper lifetime is suggesting that gamma1 times proper lifetime equals... Let\'s Calculate proper lifetime. The particle must travel 30 m. In the lab, seen as. So the time needed is t = 30/c. The particle lifetime in lab frame is γτ. Hence,\n\nif  γτ ≥ t = 30/c, the particle survives. But particle decay is an exponential process.\n\nThe survival probability would be the probability that the particle\'s lifetime in lab frame is longer than t. Based on exponential distribution, the survival probability is:\n\nP = exp( - t/(γτ) )\n\nTherefore, we need another parametrization.\n\nBut how do we get τ?\n\nBut perhaps the given that when γ=20, P=1/3: allows us to write:\n\n1/3 = exp( - (30/c)/(20*τ) )\n\nThus, solving for τ here:\n\nln(1/3) = - (30/c)/(20*τ )\n\nThen,\n\nτ = (30 / (20 * c * |ln(1/3)| )) )\n\n|ln(1/3)| = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986\n\nSo:\n\nτ ≈ 30 / (20 * c * 1.0986 )\n\nBut actual value of tau isn\'t necessary because when computing the required gamma for P=2/3：\n\n2/3 = exp( - (30/c ) / (gamma * τ ) )\n\nBut substituting τ from first equation:\n\ntau = 30 / (20 * c *1.0986 )\n\nHence,\n\n(30/c)/(gamma* tau )= (30/c)/ (gamma* [30/(20 c 1.0986) ]) )= (30/c ) * (20 c 1.0986 ) / ( gamma 30 )\n\nSimplifying, 20 *1.0986 / gamma.\n\nSo,\n\nargument exponent:\n\n- 20 *1.0986 / gamma = ln(2/3 )\n\nSo the exponent of the survival P=2/3 is:\n\nln(2/3) = -0.405...\n\nTherefore,\n\n-20*1.0986 / gamma = -0.4055...\n\nThus,\n\n20*1.0986 / gamma = 0.4055\n\nThus,\n\ngamma = (20*1.0986)/0.4055 ≈ (21.972)/0.4055 ≈ 54.17, as before.\n\nHence, whatever way, they all reach the same value, approximately 54.2.\n\nTherefore, to have the survival probability go from 1/3 to 2/3, Lorentz factor needs to be approx doubling? Wait, from 20 to 54 is nearly 2.7 factor.\n\nBut dissociation is multiplicative here as it\'s cast through an exponent.\n\nAlternatively, triple check.\n\nBut unless I missed some key factor.\n\nWait, maybe in ultra-relativistic motion, time dilation is gamma, so higher gamma means particle lives longer: so higher survival rate.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector inner walls, we start by analyzing the given conditions and using the exponential decay law. 

Given:
- The radius of the detector is 30 meters.
- With a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), one-third of the particles reach the walls.
- We need to find the Lorentz factor \( \gamma_2 \) such that two-thirds of the particles reach the walls.

The survival probability for a particle to reach the detector walls is given by:
\[ P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right) \]
where \( t = \frac{30}{c} \) is the time taken to travel 30 meters at the speed of light \( c \), and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

For the initial condition with \( \gamma_1 = 20 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \):
\[ \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \gamma_1 \tau}\right) \]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \gamma_1 \tau} \]
\[ \ln(3) = \frac{30}{c \gamma_1 \tau} \]
\[ \gamma_1 \tau = \frac{30}{c \ln(3)} \]

For the desired condition with \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \):
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \gamma_2 \tau}\right) \]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \gamma_2 \tau} \]
\[ \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{30}{c \gamma_2 \tau} \]

Using the relationship from the initial condition:
\[ \gamma_2 \tau = \frac{30}{c \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)} \]

Dividing the equations for \( \gamma_1 \tau \) and \( \gamma_2 \tau \):
\[ \frac{\gamma_1 \tau}{\gamma_2 \tau} = \frac{\frac{30}{c \ln(3)}}{\frac{30}{c \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}} \]
\[ \frac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2} = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}{\ln(3)} \]
\[ \gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)} \]

Substituting \( \gamma_1 = 20 \):
\[ \gamma_2 = 20 \cdot \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)} \]

Calculating the values:
\[ \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \]
\[ \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \]
\[ \gamma_2 \approx 20 \cdot \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.708 \approx 54.17 \]

Thus, the required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{54}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 Therefore, the probability that a particle survives long enough to reach the detector wall is P = exp(-t / (γτ)), where t is the time taken to reach the wall.

Wait, but hold on. The survival probability in exponential decay is P(t) = exp(-t/(γτ)). The time t here is the time taken for the particle to reach the wall, which is 30m / v. Since v ≈ c, t ≈ 30m/c.

Given the survival probability as exp(- (30/cτ) / γ ). Wait, combining these formulas: the proper mean lifetime is τ, so in the lab frame, it's γτ.

The survival probability is indeed exp(-t/(γτ)) where t is the time taken to traverse the distance.

Given that t = 30 / (v) ≈ 30 / c. Therefore, the argument of the exponential becomes - (30 / c) / (γτ) = -30/(c γ τ).

Wait, that seems different from how I thought earlier. Let me check again.

Yes, Survival probability in lab frame is probability that the particle lives longer than time t, which requires:

t_decay > t = 30 / v ≈ 30 / c

So the survival probability is exp(- t / t_lab), where t_lab = γ τ.

Therefore, P = exp(- t / (γ τ)).

But t is 30 / c.

So substituting:

P = exp( - (30)/(c γ τ) )

But wait, that gives Survival probability exp(-30/(c γ τ)) ?

But how do we connect this with the given data? Let's recap.

Original scenario: Lorentz factor is γ1 = 20, survival probability P1 = 1/3.

We need to find γ2 such that survival probability P2 = 2/3.

Assuming that τ is a fixed proper lifetime for the particles, and c is constant. The key is that the survival probability depends inversely on the Lorentz factor. Because as the Gamma increases, the lifetime in the lab frame t_lab = γ τ increases, so particles live longer, thus have higher survival probability.

Wait, if the Survival probability P = exp(- t / (γ τ)), then higher γ means exponent’s magnitude is smaller, so exp(-something smaller) ~ 1 - something, which would approach 1.

But in the original case, P1 =1/3, which means exponent is - ln(1/3) ≈ 1.0986.

So,

1.0986 ≈ (30/(c τ)) / γ1

Similarly, for the new case:

To get P2 =2/3, the exponent needs to be -ln(2/3) ≈ -(-0.4055) ≈ 0.4055.

Wait, no:

Wait, if Survival probability P = exp(- t / (γ τ)), so if for the original case exp(- t / (γ1 τ)) = 1/3.

Then, t/(γ1 τ) = - ln(1/3) ≈ 1.0986

Let me write: corresponding value for 1/3

Equation (1):

(30)/(c * γ1 * τ) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

Similarly, in the desired case of 2/3 survival:

exp( - (30) / (c * γ2 * τ) ) = 2/3

Taking natural log: - (30)/(c γ2 τ) = ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055.

Hence:

(30)/(γ2 τ c) ≈ 0.4055.

But equation (1) gives:

(30)/(γ1 τ c) ≈ 1.0986.

Thus, dividing equation (2) by equation (1):

[ (30)/(γ2 τ c) ] / [ (30)/(γ1 τ c) ] = 0.4055 / 1.0986

The left side is (γ1 / γ2), thus:

γ1 / γ2 ≈ 0.4055 / 1.0986 ≈ 0.369

So γ2 ≈ γ1 / 0.369 ≈ 20 / 0.369 ≈ 54.2.

Therefore, this suggests that a Lorentz factor of approximately 54 would be needed to increase the survival probability from 1/3 to 2/3.

But is there something missing? Yes, probably need to verify.

Alternatively, since the problem states "new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20"; so we can assume that all moving particles have the same lorentz factor? Then, as being ultra-relativistic, velocity v ≈ c, but proper lifetime tau. The difference is when Lorentz factors are higher, so the lifetime in lab frame is higher by gamma, so particles live longer, thus more reaching.

From the initial condition:

At current gamma (~20), 1/3 reach.

At desired gamma (gamma_?), 2/3 reach.

Assuming that when they travel distance d = beta*gamma*c*tau.

But because particles move at ultrarelativistic speeds, beta ≈ 1, so d ≈ gamma*c*tau.

Distance needed: 30 m.

So, Probability to survive is p = exp( -d/(gamma*c tau) ), but d ~ gamma c tau * t / tau?

Wait, maybe need to clarify again.

The proper lifetime is tau, so lab frame lifetime is gamma tau.

The needed time to reach the wall is t = d / v ≈ d / c when v ≈ c.

If in lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, so the survival probability (probability that t < gamma tau) is the same as the probability that the particle lifetime T satisfies T > t.

Since the decay follows an exponential distribution, p = exp( -t / (gamma tau) )

And in order to have p =1/3, which gives t / (gamma tau) = ln(3). Which rearranged, gamma tau = t / ln(3)

Then, for desired p =2/3 , we have t / (gamma' tau) = ln(3/2). So t/(gamma' tau)) = ln(2/3^{-1}) which if ln(3/2).

So yes, same path as before.

But proceeding:

Original gamma, gamma1 = 20.

gamma1 * tau = t / ln(3)

Not sure.

Actually,

From the given survival probability:

First scenario,

exp( - t / (gamma1 * tau) ) = 1/3

=> t / ( gamma1 * tau ) = ln(3)

=> tau = t / (gamma1 * ln(3))

In the second scenario,

exp( - t / (gamma2 * tau) ) = 2/3

=> t / (gamma2 * tau) = ln( (2/3)^{-1} ) ? Wait or the way I did before:

Wait for survival probability P = 2/3. The survival probability is the probability of the lifetime in lab frame exceeding t. So if we set:

P = exp( - t / (gamma2 tau) )

Hence, take log both sides,

ln(2/3) = - t / (gamma2 tau )

But from first case, Hmmm, the key is to relate the two gamma values.

We can express tau from first scenario:

gamma1 tau = - t / ln(1/3 )

From original case. Because take natural log of 1/3:

ln(1/3) = - ln(3) = - t/(gamma1 tau )

Hence,

gamma1 tau = t / ln(3)

Thus, tau = t / (gamma1 ln(3))

Then moving to the second scenario,

we need gamma2 such that,

exp( - t / (gamma2 tau )) = 2/3

Substitute tau from above,

We have,

-t / ( gamma2 * [ t / (gamma1 ln(3)) ]) = ln(2/3 )

Simplify,

- (gamma1 ln(3) ) / gamma2 = ln(2/3 )

Multiply both sides by -1,

gamma1 ln(3) / gamma2 = - ln(2/3 ) = ln(3/2 )

Thus,

gamma2 = (gamma1 ln(3)) / ln(3/2 )

Given gamma1 =20

Calculating numerator:

gamma1 * ln(3) ≈ 20*1.0986 ≈ 21.972

Denominator: ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

Gamma2 ≈ 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ approximately 54.17

So approximately 54.17. So rounded, we can say γ ≈ 54.

So requires Lorentz factor about 54.

Is there another way to think about this? For instance utting all concepts aside and reasoning statistically on the distance required.

In origin，probability of reachings 1/3. At gamma1=20, on average, the proper lifetime is suggesting that gamma1 times proper lifetime equals... Let's Calculate proper lifetime. The particle must travel 30 m. In the lab, seen as. So the time needed is t = 30/c. The particle lifetime in lab frame is γτ. Hence,

if  γτ ≥ t = 30/c, the particle survives. But particle decay is an exponential process.

The survival probability would be the probability that the particle's lifetime in lab frame is longer than t. Based on exponential distribution, the survival probability is:

P = exp( - t/(γτ) )

Therefore, we need another parametrization.

But how do we get τ?

But perhaps the given that when γ=20, P=1/3: allows us to write:

1/3 = exp( - (30/c)/(20*τ) )

Thus, solving for τ here:

ln(1/3) = - (30/c)/(20*τ )

Then,

τ = (30 / (20 * c * |ln(1/3)| )) )

|ln(1/3)| = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

So:

τ ≈ 30 / (20 * c * 1.0986 )

But actual value of tau isn't necessary because when computing the required gamma for P=2/3：

2/3 = exp( - (30/c ) / (gamma * τ ) )

But substituting τ from first equation:

tau = 30 / (20 * c *1.0986 )

Hence,

(30/c)/(gamma* tau )= (30/c)/ (gamma* [30/(20 c 1.0986) ]) )= (30/c ) * (20 c 1.0986 ) / ( gamma 30 )

Simplifying, 20 *1.0986 / gamma.

So,

argument exponent:

- 20 *1.0986 / gamma = ln(2/3 )

So the exponent of the survival P=2/3 is:

ln(2/3) = -0.405...

Therefore,

-20*1.0986 / gamma = -0.4055...

Thus,

20*1.0986 / gamma = 0.4055

Thus,

gamma = (20*1.0986)/0.4055 ≈ (21.972)/0.4055 ≈ 54.17, as before.

Hence, whatever way, they all reach the same value, approximately 54.2.

Therefore, to have the survival probability go from 1/3 to 2/3, Lorentz factor needs to be approx doubling? Wait, from 20 to 54 is nearly 2.7 factor.

But dissociation is multiplicative here as it's cast through an exponent.

Alternatively, triple check.

But unless I missed some key factor.

Wait, maybe in ultra-relativistic motion, time dilation is gamma, so higher gamma means particle lives longer: so higher survival rate. Therefore, according to our calculation, if we multiply gamma by approximately 2.7, the survival probability increases from 1/3 to 2/3. That seems reasonable.

Another way: suppose Particle's lifetime in lab frame is γτ between decays. Contemplate if survival probability x gamma constant: if P1γ1 = P2γ2, at non-relativistic? No, maybe with exponential it's different.

But. Wait, as established through formulas, the outcome is gamma2=54. Therefore, answer would be approximately 54.

But should I see whether 30 metres, gamma about 54.

For the given problem, the result is 54左右。

Therefore boxed \boxed{54}

**Final Answer**
The required Lorentz factor is \boxed{54}.

If particles decay with mean lifetime τ in their rest frame, then in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is γτ. The probability that a particle created at t=0 survives until time t is given by the exponential decay law:\n\nP(t) = exp(-t / (γτ)).\n\nBut for a particle moving at velocity v ≈ c, the time to reach the detector wall is t = r / c = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds. The probability that the particle survives until that time is:\n\nP = exp(- t / (γτ)) = exp(- (30 / c) / (γτ)).\n\nBut since when γ = 20, the probability of reaching the wall is 1/3, maybe we can model that fraction as proportional to the survival probability. Therefore, we can set up a ratio. Perhaps solve for the relation between the survival probabilities when the Lorentz factors change.\n\nWait, but actually, regardless of direction, since particles are emitted isotropically, their speed direction is random. But in the problem statement, it\'s mentioned that "on average, one third ... reaches the detector inner walls". Hmm, so perhaps this is integrating over all possible emission directions?\n\nBut when particles are emitted isotropically, they don\'t all have the same path length. Wait, that\'s the point. Because particles can move at an angle from the center towards the wall. Wait, but even so, for a sphere, any direction from the center is radial, and the distance to the wall in that direction is 30 meters.\n\nWait a second: if it\'s a spherical detector, and particles are generated at the center, then regardless of their direction, from the center, the distance required to hit the wall is exactly the radius, 30 meters. So perhaps that explains why given that when γ is 20, so lifetime is longer, but how is it that even so, only one third reach the walls? Because if the lab frame lifetime is γτ, regardless of direction, then the time to reach the wall is t = 30 / (v), which for v ≈ c is about t = 30m / 3e8 m/s ≈ 1e-7 seconds. However, the lab frame lifetime is γτ. So the survival probability would be exp(-t/(γτ)).\n\nIf that is the case, then 1/3 = exp(-t/(γτ)) with γ = 20. Then solving for t/(γτ) gives -ln(1/3) ≈ 1.0986. So t/(γτ) ≈ 1.0986 → τ = t / (γ * 1.0986). This relation defines τ based on initial data.\n\nBut we seek to achieve P = 2/3, so the survival of two-thirds. So we need new γ\' such that:\n\n2/3 = exp(- t/(γ\' τ)).\n\nSo solving this would be -ln(2/3) ≈ 0.4055 = t/(γ\' τ). Since τ is t/(γ_initial * 1.0986) from the previous step, substituting that:\n\n0.4055 = t/(γ\' (t/(γ_initial * 1.0986)))).\n\nSimplifying, 0.4055 = γ_initial * 1.0986 / γ\'\n\nTherefore, γ\' = (γ_initial * 1.0986)/0.4055 ≈ γ_initial * 2.709.\n\nBut γ_initial is 20, so γ\' ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18.\n\nBut wait, is this logic correct? This supposes the proper lifetime τ is known, and when changing γ, τ remains fixed (since τ is proper). But since somehow τ is related to the real survival time. But maybe step-by-step:\n\nGiven:\n\nAt γ_1 = 20, P_1 = 1/3.\n\nWe need γ_2 such that P_2 = 2/3.\n\nNeed to find γ_2.\n\nAssuming the survival probability is given by exponential decay. The survival probability is proportional to the number of particles not decayed. Since the time each particle takes is fixed (30 m / c ≈ 1e-7 s) mostly, if movement is negligible compared to c. But no, since particles moving at different directions?\n\nWait, confusion arises here. Let\'s verify: For a fixed direction, each particle must survive for t = 30m / (v * cosθ), if they are moving at angle θ from the radius. Wait, but since they\'re going from the center, maybe even direction?\n\nHold on. Actually, for a detector that\'s spherical, and particles emitted isotropically. In that case, each particle moves in a radial direction. So if the detector is centered at the origin, the particle direction is in any radial direction. Therefore, regardless of the direction, the path length is 30 meters. Wait, but particles moving in any direction of the sphere would require traveling 30 meters? That seems counterintuitive. For a normal sphere, if you are at a point inside, the maximum distance to the edge is the radius, but if you move in the opposite direction, the distance might be small. Wait, but here particles are created at the center. So irrespective of direction, moving from the center, in any direction towards a point on the sphere. Therefore, the distance they have to travel is exactly 30 meters, regardless of direction. For example, direction of movement from the center of the sphere to the surface: any direction. So the required path is 30 meters.\n\nUnless this is not how they are produced. Wait, the problem mentions \'travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20\'. It says the detector is spherical, so produced along different directions. Now, since the decay follows an exponential distribution, each particle will have a certain probability to survive the time it takes to traverse the radius. Thus, for a particle moving at velocity v, the time it would take to hit the detector wall is t = r / (v), where r is 30 m, and v ≈ c (ultra-relativistic).\n\nTherefore, the survival probability would be P = exp(-t / (γτ)). However, this requires them to know the proper lifetime τ. But the problem likely assumes that the only variable here is the Lorentz factor γ. Given the same experimental setup: same τ (proper lifetime), same r; and you need to adjust γ such that the survival probability increases from 1/3 to 2/3. If that is the case.\n\nLet’s model this mathematically. The survival probability is determined by:\n\nP = exp(-t / (γτ))\n\nHere, t is time required to reach the detector. Since the particle is moving at v ≈ c, t = 30 m / c ≈ 30 / (3e8) seconds = 1e-7 seconds.\n\nLet’s note. If we set for γ = 20, P = 1/3. Therefore,\n\n1/3 = exp(- t / (20 τ)) -- (1)\n\nWe need for desired γ’,\n\n2/3 = exp(- t / (γ’ τ)) -- (2)\n\nDivide equation (2) by equation (1):\n\n(2/3) / (1/3) = exp(- t/(γ’ τ)) / exp(- t/(20 τ))\n\n=> 2 = exp [ - t/(γ’ τ) + t/(20 τ) )\n\nWhich means\n\nln(2) = [ - t/(γ’ τ) + t/(20 τ) ]\n\nBut solve for γ’:\n\nln(2) = ( t / τ ) [ -1/γ’ + 1/20 ]\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n1/3 = exp( - t/(20 τ) ) → ln(1/3) = - t/(20 τ) → t / τ = -20 ln(1/3) = 20 ln 3\n\nThus,\n\nln(2) = [20 ln3] [ -1/γ’ + 1/20 ]\n\nMultiply the 20 ln3 in,\n\nln(2) = - (20 ln3)/ γ’ + ln3\n\nBring terms together:\n\nln(2) - ln3 = - (20 ln3)/ γ’\n\nSo,\n\nln(2/3) = - (20 ln3)/ γ’\n\nMultiply both sides by -1,\n\n- ln(2/3) = (20 ln3)/ γ’\n\nWhich is equivalent to,\n\nln(3/2) = (20 ln3)/ γ’\n\nHence,\n\nγ’ = (20 ln3)/ ln(3/2)\n\nCompute this value numerically.\n\nCalculate ln3 ≈ 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) ≈ ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055\n\nTherefore,\n\nγ’ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16\n\nTherefore, approximately 54.16.\n\nHowever, since the problem states “about two thirds”, perhaps this 54.16 could be approximated as 54 or generalized neatly, but in exams, probably 54, 55, or maybe expressed as 20 multiplied by ln3 / ln(3/2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate ln3/ln(3/2) ≈ 1.0986/0.4055 ≈ 2.709, then 20*2.709 ≈ 54.18. So approximately 54.\n\nHowever, in reality, exponential survival probabilities, actual numbers for probabilities. Alternatively, maybe this comes through the same formula but without considering the isotropic assumption?\n\nWait, no, in my initial step, but if the detector is spherical, and particles emitted in all directions, then their flight time is actually smth different. For example: a particle emitted at an angle θ would have to travel in a straight line, but the detector is spherical. Wait, but particles created at the center of the sphere moving in any direction will reach the detector in 30 / (v cosθ), right? Because their path would have a radial component. Wait, perhaps not. Since they start at the center, moving in any direction would be radially outward from the center. Wait, but in that case, even if a particle moves in a certain direction angle, since the sphere is centered at the original point, the distance they need to exit is the radius. Wait no, maybe actually in that case, regardless of direction they have to move 30 meters. Because position (0,0,0), moving in direction (x,y,z), the edge is at radius 30. So directional projection, but moved in a straight line. Therefore, path length for all directions is 30 meters.\n\nWait another way, suppose I\'m at the center of a spherical detector. If I move in any direction, towards the sphere\'s periphery, the path I need to take is exactly 30 meters. Regardless if it\'s radial or not. Because in polar coordinates, the radial coordinate is going from center at 0 to 30. Therefore, yes, straight line movement in any direction with length 30 meters. Hence, t = 30 / (βc). But beta ≈1 for ultra-relativistic speeds. Thus t=30/c. Hence, time is same for all particles.\n\nBut is that true? Wait, if particles move straight in any direction, yes.. because in a sphere, radial direction only.\n\nThus wait, if particles are moving in straight lines from center in any direction, then they\'re going radially outward, so path length is r=30 meters. However, velocity direction is along radius, but depending on direction, a particle is moving towards different parts of detector but path length is still r=30 meters from central point. Therefore, if all particles are moving radially outward, then all of them, once generated, need to move 30 meters to reach the walls.\n\nTherefore,, the time to reach the wall, given velocity (which is βc, β=sqrt(1 -1/γ²)^.5≈1 for γ=20), but roughly t= 30/(βc). Since beta, for γ=20, β = sqrt(1-(1/20)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0025) ≈ 0.99987. However, even if not exact, for ultra-relativistic, β is approximately 1. So t≈ 30 /c for all.\n\nThus each particle has a flight time of t=~1e-7 seconds. The mean lifetime in lab frame is γ τ. Therefore, the probability to survive that time is e^{- t / (γ τ)}. So equation exp(- t/(γ τ)) = survival probability.\n\nTherefore, based on original data, with γ=20, probability is 1/3. So set:\n\n1/3 = exp(- (30 / c)/(20 τ)), solve for (30/(c τ)), but since tau is proper.\n\nBut for desired probability, two thirds:\n\n2/3 = exp(- (30/(c τ γ’)} )\n\nSo to link the two:\n\nLet’s let x = (30)/(c τ). Then, at start: 1/3 = exp(-x /20) → x = -20 ln(1/3). For the second case: 2/3 = exp(-x / γ’). Taking logarithm, ln(2/3) = -x / γ’. Therefore, γ’ = x / (-ln(2/3)).\n\nBut since x = -20 ln(1/3), substitute:\n\nγ’ = (-20 ln(1/3)) / (-ln(2/3)) = (20 ln3)/(ln(3/2)).\n\nExactly as earlier, getting γ’ = 20 ln3 / ln(1.5). Then compute:\n\nCalculating ln(3) ≈1.0986, ln(1.5)=0.4055. Therefore, 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈2.708. Multiply by 20, gets≈54.16. Therefore, approx 54.\n\nDue to thin ice if perhaps problem expect depends on different path length. Or if considering direction of movement affects survival probability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps equally incorrect to consider isotropic decay.\n\nWait, but perhaps need to account that not all particles travel 30m. If moving direction is not radial, the path is longer than 30m? Wait if not traveling along radius? Wait, but if I\'m at the center, moving in any direction, connecting the center to surface is the radial direction, so once departure from center in arbitrary direction, the path is straight-line—thus 30m path.

Given that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector with a radius of 30 meters and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, we need to determine the Lorentz factor required for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls. 

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The radius of the detector is 30 meters.
   - With a Lorentz factor of 20, one-third of the particles reach the detector walls.
   - The survival probability of a particle is given by the exponential decay law: \( P(t) = \exp(-t / (\gamma \tau)) \), where \( t \) is the time to reach the wall, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

2. **Key Equations**:
   - For the initial Lorentz factor \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), the survival probability is \( \frac{1}{3} \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30 / c}{20 \tau}\right)
     \]
   - For the desired Lorentz factor \( \gamma_2 \), the survival probability is \( \frac{2}{3} \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30 / c}{\gamma_2 \tau}\right)
     \]

3. **Solving for \(\gamma_2 \)**:
   - From the initial condition, we find:
     \[
     \frac{30 / c}{20 \tau} = -\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \ln(3)
     \]
   - Substituting this into the equation for \(\gamma_2 \):
     \[
     \frac{30 / c}{\gamma_2 \tau} = -\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Relating the two equations:
     \[
     \frac{\gamma_2}{20} = \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}
     \]
   - Calculating the ratio:
     \[
     \gamma_2 = 20 \times \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}
     \]
   - Using approximate values for the natural logarithms:
     \[
     \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \quad \text{and} \quad \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055
     \]
     \[
     \gamma_2 \approx 20 \times \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \times 2.708 \approx 54.16
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The required Lorentz factor is approximately \(\boxed{55}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Wait, but perhaps we need to consider the survival probability for each particle. If particles decay with mean lifetime τ in their rest frame, then in the lab frame, the mean lifetime is γτ. The probability that a particle created at t=0 survives until time t is given by the exponential decay law:

P(t) = exp(-t / (γτ)).

But for a particle moving at velocity v ≈ c, the time to reach the detector wall is t = r / c = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds. The probability that the particle survives until that time is:

P = exp(- t / (γτ)) = exp(- (30 / c) / (γτ)).

But since when γ = 20, the probability of reaching the wall is 1/3, maybe we can model that fraction as proportional to the survival probability. Therefore, we can set up a ratio. Perhaps solve for the relation between the survival probabilities when the Lorentz factors change.

Wait, but actually, regardless of direction, since particles are emitted isotropically, their speed direction is random. But in the problem statement, it's mentioned that "on average, one third ... reaches the detector inner walls". Hmm, so perhaps this is integrating over all possible emission directions?

But when particles are emitted isotropically, they don't all have the same path length. Wait, that's the point. Because particles can move at an angle from the center towards the wall. Wait, but even so, for a sphere, any direction from the center is radial, and the distance to the wall in that direction is 30 meters.

Wait a second: if it's a spherical detector, and particles are generated at the center, then regardless of their direction, from the center, the distance required to hit the wall is exactly the radius, 30 meters. So perhaps that explains why given that when γ is 20, so lifetime is longer, but how is it that even so, only one third reach the walls? Because if the lab frame lifetime is γτ, regardless of direction, then the time to reach the wall is t = 30 / (v), which for v ≈ c is about t = 30m / 3e8 m/s ≈ 1e-7 seconds. However, the lab frame lifetime is γτ. So the survival probability would be exp(-t/(γτ)).

If that is the case, then 1/3 = exp(-t/(γτ)) with γ = 20. Then solving for t/(γτ) gives -ln(1/3) ≈ 1.0986. So t/(γτ) ≈ 1.0986 → τ = t / (γ * 1.0986). This relation defines τ based on initial data.

But we seek to achieve P = 2/3, so the survival of two-thirds. So we need new γ' such that:

2/3 = exp(- t/(γ' τ)).

So solving this would be -ln(2/3) ≈ 0.4055 = t/(γ' τ). Since τ is t/(γ_initial * 1.0986) from the previous step, substituting that:

0.4055 = t/(γ' (t/(γ_initial * 1.0986)))).

Simplifying, 0.4055 = γ_initial * 1.0986 / γ'

Therefore, γ' = (γ_initial * 1.0986)/0.4055 ≈ γ_initial * 2.709.

But γ_initial is 20, so γ' ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18.

But wait, is this logic correct? This supposes the proper lifetime τ is known, and when changing γ, τ remains fixed (since τ is proper). But since somehow τ is related to the real survival time. But maybe step-by-step:

Given:

At γ_1 = 20, P_1 = 1/3.

We need γ_2 such that P_2 = 2/3.

Need to find γ_2.

Assuming the survival probability is given by exponential decay. The survival probability is proportional to the number of particles not decayed. Since the time each particle takes is fixed (30 m / c ≈ 1e-7 s) mostly, if movement is negligible compared to c. But no, since particles moving at different directions?

Wait, confusion arises here. Let's verify: For a fixed direction, each particle must survive for t = 30m / (v * cosθ), if they are moving at angle θ from the radius. Wait, but since they're going from the center, maybe even direction?

Hold on. Actually, for a detector that's spherical, and particles emitted isotropically. In that case, each particle moves in a radial direction. So if the detector is centered at the origin, the particle direction is in any radial direction. Therefore, regardless of the direction, the path length is 30 meters. Wait, but particles moving in any direction of the sphere would require traveling 30 meters? That seems counterintuitive. For a normal sphere, if you are at a point inside, the maximum distance to the edge is the radius, but if you move in the opposite direction, the distance might be small. Wait, but here particles are created at the center. So irrespective of direction, moving from the center, in any direction towards a point on the sphere. Therefore, the distance they have to travel is exactly 30 meters, regardless of direction. For example, direction of movement from the center of the sphere to the surface: any direction. So the required path is 30 meters.

Unless this is not how they are produced. Wait, the problem mentions 'travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20'. It says the detector is spherical, so produced along different directions. Now, since the decay follows an exponential distribution, each particle will have a certain probability to survive the time it takes to traverse the radius. Thus, for a particle moving at velocity v, the time it would take to hit the detector wall is t = r / (v), where r is 30 m, and v ≈ c (ultra-relativistic).

Therefore, the survival probability would be P = exp(-t / (γτ)). However, this requires them to know the proper lifetime τ. But the problem likely assumes that the only variable here is the Lorentz factor γ. Given the same experimental setup: same τ (proper lifetime), same r; and you need to adjust γ such that the survival probability increases from 1/3 to 2/3. If that is the case.

Let’s model this mathematically. The survival probability is determined by:

P = exp(-t / (γτ))

Here, t is time required to reach the detector. Since the particle is moving at v ≈ c, t = 30 m / c ≈ 30 / (3e8) seconds = 1e-7 seconds.

Let’s note. If we set for γ = 20, P = 1/3. Therefore,

1/3 = exp(- t / (20 τ)) -- (1)

We need for desired γ’,

2/3 = exp(- t / (γ’ τ)) -- (2)

Divide equation (2) by equation (1):

(2/3) / (1/3) = exp(- t/(γ’ τ)) / exp(- t/(20 τ))

=> 2 = exp [ - t/(γ’ τ) + t/(20 τ) )

Which means

ln(2) = [ - t/(γ’ τ) + t/(20 τ) ]

But solve for γ’:

ln(2) = ( t / τ ) [ -1/γ’ + 1/20 ]

From equation (1):

1/3 = exp( - t/(20 τ) ) → ln(1/3) = - t/(20 τ) → t / τ = -20 ln(1/3) = 20 ln 3

Thus,

ln(2) = [20 ln3] [ -1/γ’ + 1/20 ]

Multiply the 20 ln3 in,

ln(2) = - (20 ln3)/ γ’ + ln3

Bring terms together:

ln(2) - ln3 = - (20 ln3)/ γ’

So,

ln(2/3) = - (20 ln3)/ γ’

Multiply both sides by -1,

- ln(2/3) = (20 ln3)/ γ’

Which is equivalent to,

ln(3/2) = (20 ln3)/ γ’

Hence,

γ’ = (20 ln3)/ ln(3/2)

Compute this value numerically.

Calculate ln3 ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

Therefore,

γ’ ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16

Therefore, approximately 54.16.

However, since the problem states “about two thirds”, perhaps this 54.16 could be approximated as 54 or generalized neatly, but in exams, probably 54, 55, or maybe expressed as 20 multiplied by ln3 / ln(3/2).

Alternatively, perhaps approximate ln3/ln(3/2) ≈ 1.0986/0.4055 ≈ 2.709, then 20*2.709 ≈ 54.18. So approximately 54.

However, in reality, exponential survival probabilities, actual numbers for probabilities. Alternatively, maybe this comes through the same formula but without considering the isotropic assumption?

Wait, no, in my initial step, but if the detector is spherical, and particles emitted in all directions, then their flight time is actually smth different. For example: a particle emitted at an angle θ would have to travel in a straight line, but the detector is spherical. Wait, but particles created at the center of the sphere moving in any direction will reach the detector in 30 / (v cosθ), right? Because their path would have a radial component. Wait, perhaps not. Since they start at the center, moving in any direction would be radially outward from the center. Wait, but in that case, even if a particle moves in a certain direction angle, since the sphere is centered at the original point, the distance they need to exit is the radius. Wait no, maybe actually in that case, regardless of direction they have to move 30 meters. Because position (0,0,0), moving in direction (x,y,z), the edge is at radius 30. So directional projection, but moved in a straight line. Therefore, path length for all directions is 30 meters.

Wait another way, suppose I'm at the center of a spherical detector. If I move in any direction, towards the sphere's periphery, the path I need to take is exactly 30 meters. Regardless if it's radial or not. Because in polar coordinates, the radial coordinate is going from center at 0 to 30. Therefore, yes, straight line movement in any direction with length 30 meters. Hence, t = 30 / (βc). But beta ≈1 for ultra-relativistic speeds. Thus t=30/c. Hence, time is same for all particles.

But is that true? Wait, if particles move straight in any direction, yes.. because in a sphere, radial direction only.

Thus wait, if particles are moving in straight lines from center in any direction, then they're going radially outward, so path length is r=30 meters. However, velocity direction is along radius, but depending on direction, a particle is moving towards different parts of detector but path length is still r=30 meters from central point. Therefore, if all particles are moving radially outward, then all of them, once generated, need to move 30 meters to reach the walls.

Therefore,, the time to reach the wall, given velocity (which is βc, β=sqrt(1 -1/γ²)^.5≈1 for γ=20), but roughly t= 30/(βc). Since beta, for γ=20, β = sqrt(1-(1/20)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.0025) ≈ 0.99987. However, even if not exact, for ultra-relativistic, β is approximately 1. So t≈ 30 /c for all.

Thus each particle has a flight time of t=~1e-7 seconds. The mean lifetime in lab frame is γ τ. Therefore, the probability to survive that time is e^{- t / (γ τ)}. So equation exp(- t/(γ τ)) = survival probability.

Therefore, based on original data, with γ=20, probability is 1/3. So set:

1/3 = exp(- (30 / c)/(20 τ)), solve for (30/(c τ)), but since tau is proper.

But for desired probability, two thirds:

2/3 = exp(- (30/(c τ γ’)} )

So to link the two:

Let’s let x = (30)/(c τ). Then, at start: 1/3 = exp(-x /20) → x = -20 ln(1/3). For the second case: 2/3 = exp(-x / γ’). Taking logarithm, ln(2/3) = -x / γ’. Therefore, γ’ = x / (-ln(2/3)).

But since x = -20 ln(1/3), substitute:

γ’ = (-20 ln(1/3)) / (-ln(2/3)) = (20 ln3)/(ln(3/2)).

Exactly as earlier, getting γ’ = 20 ln3 / ln(1.5). Then compute:

Calculating ln(3) ≈1.0986, ln(1.5)=0.4055. Therefore, 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈2.708. Multiply by 20, gets≈54.16. Therefore, approx 54.

Due to thin ice if perhaps problem expect depends on different path length. Or if considering direction of movement affects survival probability.

Alternatively, perhaps equally incorrect to consider isotropic decay.

Wait, but perhaps need to account that not all particles travel 30m. If moving direction is not radial, the path is longer than 30m? Wait if not traveling along radius? Wait, but if I'm at the center, moving in any direction, connecting the center to surface is the radial direction, so once departure from center in arbitrary direction, the path is straight-line—thus 30m path. Therefore, in that case, static. Hence, no matter the direction, the path is always 30m. Hence, all particles have to survive 30m. Thus, isotropic emission but each particle's path is exactly radius.

So then survival probability is same for all particles, all trajectories: exp(- t/(γ τ)). So s worked equations make sense. Thus, Lorentz factor of approx 54 is needed to make two-thirds survival.

Therefore, the answer is roughly 54. But maybe the problem expects exactly γ=40? However, seems way exponential pops.

But checking, if γ was doubled from 20 to 40, would survival probability change, but exponentials are way nonlinear.

Double γ from 20 (1): Survival probability goes from exp(-k/20) to exp(-k/40). With k/tau = (30 /c). Original Probability with γ=20: exp(-k/(20))=1/3. P_new for γ=40: sqrt(1/3) ~ 0.577, which is ~58%, which is lower than two-thirds. Two-thirds is around 66.6%.

While with gamma=54.16, we get:

Wait follows that ratio must be ln(2/3)/ln(1/3) *20.

Alternatively:

From 1/3 → 2/3: multiply survival probability by 2.

Exponential decay: The ratio of needed gamma is log of probabilites... As above.

Alternatively Hmm, All correct. Alternatively redo format.

Original survival probability: 1/3 = Exp[ - r / (c * γ * τ) ]

 So rearranged, τ = r / (c γ (-ln(1/3)) )

Then, new gamma needed,

Update:

Survival probability 2/3 = Exp[ - r/(c γ’ τ) ]

Substitute τ from before,

 r/(c γ’ τ ) = r / (c γ’ ( r / (c γ (-ln(1/3)) )) )

Thus becomes:

Simplifies to [r * c γ (-ln(1/3)) ] / (c γ’ r) = [ γ (-ln(1/3)) ] / γ’

Set equal to:

- ln(2/3 )

Hence,

[ γ (-ln(1/3)) ] / γ’ = - ln(2/3 )

Multiply both sides by γ’,

γ (-ln(1/3)) ) = - γ’ ln(2/3 )

So γ’ = γ ( ln(1/3) ) / ln(2/3 )

Note that the negatives canceled:

ln(1/3) = -ln3, ln(2/3)=ln2 - ln3 ≈-0.405. Thus plugging:

γ’ = γ (-ln3) / (ln2 - ln3 )

So γ’ = γ (ln3 ) / ( ln3 - ln2 )

As such.

And so,

 ln3 ≈1.0986,

ln3 - ln2 ≈1.0986 -0.6931≈0.4055

Thus,

γ’≈ γ * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ γ*2.708≈20*2.708≈54.16.

Which is the same as prior.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 54.16. To check if needed as precise, or rounded. So box gcd for answer.

**Final Answer**
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \boxed{55}.
