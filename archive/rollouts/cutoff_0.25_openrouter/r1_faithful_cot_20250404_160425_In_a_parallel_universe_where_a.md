In a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations would differ from our universe's equations. The key changes would occur in the equations related to the divergence and curl of the magnetic field \( \mathbf{B} \) and the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \). Specifically, the presence of magnetic monopoles (magnetic charge density \( \rho_m \) and magnetic current density \( \mathbf{J}_m \)) necessitates modifying the following equations:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: In our universe, this law states that the divergence of \( \mathbf{B} \) is zero (\( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \)) due to the absence of magnetic monopoles. With magnetic monopoles, this becomes non-zero and is proportional to the magnetic charge density \( \rho_m \):
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m
   \]

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: In our universe, this law states that the curl of \( \mathbf{E} \) is equal to the negative time derivative of \( \mathbf{B} \) (\( \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \)). With magnetic monopoles, a term accounting for the magnetic current density \( \mathbf{J}_m \) is added:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m
   \]

The other two Maxwell equations (Gauss's Law for Electricity and Ampère-Maxwell Law) remain unchanged in form, as they pertain to electric charge and current, which are unaffected by the presence of magnetic monopoles.

### Final Answer

The Maxwell equations that would be different are Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law of Induction. These are expressed as:

\boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}

Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. I need to figure out which of Maxwell's equations would be different in that scenario. Hmm. Let me start by recalling the original Maxwell's equations and think about how magnetic monopoles would affect them.

First, let me list out the four Maxwell's equations as we know them:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**: The electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed. The equation is ∇ · E = ρ/ε₀. 

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: The magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero, since there are no magnetic monopoles. So ∇ · B = 0.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: A changing magnetic field creates an electric field. The equation is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t.

4. **Ampère-Maxwell Law**: Electric currents and changing electric fields produce magnetic fields. The equation is ∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t.

Now, in a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, that means there are isolated North and South poles. So, this should affect the equations related to the magnetic field. Specifically, Gauss's Law for Magnetism states that there are no magnetic monopoles because the divergence of B is zero. If there were monopoles, then ∇ · B would equal some magnetic charge density, similar to how Gauss's Law for Electricity works.

So does that mean only Gauss's Law for Magnetism would change? Let me check the other equations. Faraday's Law relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B. If monopoles exist, maybe there would be a magnetic current term? Similarly, Ampère's Law might also get a term related to magnetic current if there's a symmetry.

Wait, in the original equations, Faraday's Law is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic monopoles, maybe if there's a magnetic current, this equation could have an additional term. Similarly, Ampère's Law might have a term with the magnetic current density.

But in the problem statement, they just mention the existence of isolated poles. So maybe only Gauss's Law for Magnetism would change, but Faraday's equation would remain the same? Wait, no. If there are magnetic charges, perhaps the movement of these charges would constitute a magnetic current, similar to how electric current is the movement of electric charges. Then maybe both Ampère's Law and Faraday's Law would get additional terms.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think step by step. In our universe, because there are no magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B is zero. If monopoles exist, ∇ · B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, ρ_m. So that would modify Gauss's Law for Magnetism to ∇ · B = μ₀ρ_m, maybe analogous to Gauss's Law for electricity. But I'm not sure about the constants. Wait, in Gauss's Law for electricity, the constant is 1/ε₀. But magnetism might use a different constant. Wait, maybe using μ₀, but not sure. The exact form would depend on how the units are defined, but at minimum, we can say that ∇ · B becomes non-zero.

Then, if there are magnetic charges moving, they would create a magnetic current, J_m. So in Faraday's Law, which involves the curl of E, currently it's equal to minus the time derivative of B. If there's a magnetic current, maybe Faraday's Law would have a term involving J_m. Similarly, Ampère's Law currently has the electric current J. If symmetry is considered, maybe Ampère's Law would also have a term for magnetic current. Wait, how does this symmetry work?

In our equations, when magnetic monopoles are introduced, the equations become symmetric. So, in such a case:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity remains ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism becomes ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m.

3. Faraday's Law becomes ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m.

4. Ampère's Law becomes ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

But I need to verify that. Wait, in some formulations when magnetic monopoles are considered, Faraday's Law does get a term with magnetic current, and Ampère's Law might depend on the time derivative of the electric field. Alternatively, perhaps the signs and constants differ.

Alternatively, perhaps if you have magnetic charge density ρ_m, then Gauss’s Law for magnetism would become ∇ · B = ρ_m (or with a constant). Then Faraday’s Law would get a term with the magnetic current. Specifically, according to some theoretical extensions of Maxwell’s equations to include magnetic monopoles, indeed both Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law are modified. Ampère’s Law might stay the same unless there's a displacement current related to magnetic fields. Wait, no, usually the modification is in Ampère’s Law if we consider magnetic currents, but maybe not necessarily. Let me check my memory.

So as per Dirac's theory of magnetic monopoles, he added a magnetic charge density to Gauss's Law for magnetism, and a magnetic current term to Faraday's Law. Therefore:

Original:

∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

∇ · B = 0

∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

With monopoles:

∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m (could be proportional to ρ_m with a constant, although sometimes units vary)

∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

But that seems symmetric if you exchange E and B with appropriate constants. Hmm. Alternatively, sometimes it's presented that:

∇ · B = ρ_m

∇ × E = - J_m - ∂B/∂t

But I might be mixing up terms here.

Wait, let me check. In the standard modification, with magnetic charge density ρ_m and magnetic current density J_m, Maxwell's equations become:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ · B = ρ_m * something (depends on unit system)

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m (times some constant)

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

But constants get tricky because different unit systems handle it differently. However, ignoring the constants for a moment, conceptually:

- Gauss's Law for magnetism becomes similar to Gauss's Law for electricity, introducing a divergence of B proportional to magnetic charge density.

- Faraday's Law gets an additional term due to the magnetic current, analogous to how Ampère's Law has the electric current term.

Similarly, could Ampère's Law get another term? Wait, in Ampère's Law we have the displacement current, which is the time derivative of E. If we follow symmetry, maybe there's an analogous term in Faraday's Law, but in our universe Faraday's Law already has the time derivative of B.

Wait, in the standard equations, the absence of magnetic charges leaves Faraday's Law with just the time derivative of B. Introducing monopoles requires that moving magnetic charges (i.e., magnetic current) would generate an electric field circulation, so we add J_m to Faraday's Law. So we have ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (times some constant). Similarly, and Ampère's Law already includes the displacement current, which would match with the time derivative of E. But I think whether or not Ampère's Law would need to be modified depends on whether there is a magnetic displacement current. But in our universe, there is the ∂E/∂t term, which is due to the displacement current. Similarly, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, if there is a magnetic displacement current, is there a term in Ampère’s Law? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps not. Here's a way to think: electric charges produce electric fields, and moving charges (currents) produce magnetic fields. Similarly, magnetic charges would produce magnetic fields (as in modified Gauss's Law), and moving magnetic charges (magnetic currents) would produce... Do they produce electric fields? That seems to fit with the idea that time-varying magnetic fields produce electric fields (Faraday), and if there's a current of magnetic charges, that would also contribute. So Faraday's Law would include a term for the magnetic current. Then Ampère's Law, which relates the magnetic field to electric currents, perhaps would not be directly dependent on magnetic monopole terms. But in our universe, Ampère-Maxwell Law includes both conduction current and displacement current. If you allow for the symmetry, maybe displacement currents for magnetic fields would enter as well, but I'm not sure. Wait, Ampère's Law in its original form didn’t have the displacement current; Maxwell added that to complete the equations. So if there is a symmetry with magnetic monopoles, perhaps Ampère's Law would need a similar term, but now for magnetic displacement? But in the presence of magnetic charges, I think the equations would have to account for contributions from both charges and their currents. 

Alternatively, perhaps Ampère's Law would remain as it is because it's about the response to electric currents and changing electric fields. The difference would be in Gauss's Law and Faraday's Law. 

Wait, maybe I should check an actual reference or formula. Wait a moment. Let me reason based on dimensions and symmetry. The electric field equations (Gauss and Faraday) involve electric charge and current, while the magnetic field equations (Gauss and Ampère) involve magnetic charge and current. However, in our universe, since there's no magnetic charge or current, those terms are zero.

In the presence of magnetic charge and current, you need to add those terms. Therefore, the four Maxwell equations would become:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)

2. ∇ · B = ρ_m (with appropriate constant, let’s say, ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m, but depending on unit system)

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (to account for magnetic current contributing to E's curl)

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (unchanged?)

Wait, but where is the symmetry? If there is symmetry between E and B with the inclusion of magnetic monopoles, then in Ampère's Law, maybe there's a term from the magnetic displacement current. However, displacement current is already accounted for in Ampère's Law with the ∂E/∂t term. To make the equations symmetric, perhaps there is a similar term in Faraday's Law when magnetic monopoles are present. 

Alternatively, here's another way. Let's write Maxwell's equations in a symmetric form, assuming existence of both electric and magnetic charges:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ · B = ρ_m / μ₀ ?

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m / ?

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

But this is getting into unclear territory without remembering precisely the correct coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a source addition – in the standard theory when you add magnetic monopoles, you modify two equations: Gauss's Law for magnetism, and Faraday's Law. For example:

- ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m (changed from 0)

- ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

Then Ampère's Law and Gauss's Law for electricity remain the same. If that's the case, then in this parallel universe, two of Maxwell's equations are different: Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law.

Wait, but in our standard Ampère-Maxwell Law, if there’s a current of magnetic monopoles, moving magnetic charges, so ∇ × B could have a term from the magnetic current? Hmm. Maybe not. Unless the time derivative of E is considered analogous to magnetic current. I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's see. In the original set, Faraday's Law tells us that a time-varying B-field induces an electric field. If there's a magnetic current (flowing magnetic charges), that might also act as a source for E in a similar fashion. 

On the other hand, Ampère's Law connects the curl of B to the electric current plus the displacement current. So perhaps if there were magnetic currents, there would be a term in Ampère's Law as well, but maybe not.

Alternatively, the equations would exhibit a duality. So another way is:

Original Maxwell equations:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ · B = 0

3. ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

With magnetic monopoles:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m

3. ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

So here, only equations 2 and 3 are modified, while equations 1 and 4 remain the same. Equation 3 gets a magnetic current term, focusing on how a magnetic current would induce an electric field. Equation 4 stays the same but in some formulations, if you take into account the displacement current for the magnetic field, but in this case, it's not needed because displacement current is an electric field term. Wait, the displacement current was added to Ampère's Law to account for time-varying electric fields analogously to how Faraday's Law accounts for time-varying magnetic fields.

If magnetic monopoles exist, do we need a similar term in Faraday's Law? But Faraday's Law plus the magnetic current term seems to do that.

Hold on, I think the correct answer is that Gauss’s Law for magnetism (∇ · B = 0 becomes ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m) and Faraday’s Law (∇ × E = -∂B/∂t becomes ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m). So two equations change. But the question asks "specifically which of those equations are different" in the scenario. The original equations without monopoles have ∇ · B =0 and ∇ × E without the J_m term.

But in the problem statement, is there an assumption that if magnetic monopoles exist, they can have isolated poles, but there's no mention of magnetic currents? Maybe movement of magnetic charges could lead to currents, but if the question is just about the static case, then the main difference would be Gauss’s Law for magnetism: ∇ · B ≠0.

However, Maxwell's equations inherently involve time-dependent scenarios as well, so Faraday's Law would need to account for any magnetic currents. However, if magnetic charges exist but are stationary, would that mean that only Gauss's Law changes? Hmm. The problem mentions "a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole," suggesting the existence of magnetic charges (monopoles), but not necessarily moving charges (currents). So if only ρ_m is non-zero but J_m=0, then ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t as usual, and ∇ · B = ρ_m (times some constant). But J_m is a term that comes from the movement of ρ_m, so maybe even in this universe, if monopoles exist in isolation but can move, then you have both ρ_m and J_m. But perhaps the question is only asking about the divergence equations, or maybe both.

But since Maxwell's equations connect divergences and curls in a way that ensures conservation of charge (for electric charges via the continuity equation), perhaps there must be a continuity equation for magnetic charges as well.

In other words, if ∇ · B = ρ_m, then conservation of magnetic charge would require ∂ρ_m/∂t + ∇ · J_m = 0, similar to electric charge conservation (∂ρ_e/∂t + ∇ · J_e = 0). Thus, the presence of magnetic monopoles requires introducing magnetic charge density ρ_m and magnetic current density J_m into the equations. Hence, Faraday's Law, which involves the curl of E and relates it to the time derivative of B, would also need to include J_m to maintain charge conservation.

Hence, both Gauss’s Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law must be modified.

But wait, if only Gauss’s Law changes, and Faraday's Law remains the same, then we wouldn't account for the current term necessary for conservation of magnetic charge. Hence, it's necessary that you must also amend Faraday's Law.

So the conclusion is, the presence of magnetic monopoles changes both Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law.

But wait in another perspective, when we just posit the existence of isolated magnetic charges but no motion (no currents), would only Gauss's Law for magnetism change? But equations of electromagnetism must account for the possibility of charge movement.

Alternatively, the minimal modification must be two equations, because otherwise charge continuity isn't maintained. For example, in our universe, if we didn't have the displacement current in Ampère's Law, the equations would not satisfy charge conservation with time-varying electric fields. Similarly, Gauss's Law and another equation must be adjusted to incorporate magnetic charge and current.

Therefore, I think in this parallel universe with magnetic monopoles, the equations that are different will be Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law. Gauss's Law now includes magnetic charge density, and Faraday's Law includes a magnetic current density term.

Hence, answering the question: which equations? Specifically, Gauss's Law for Magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's Law of Induction (equation 3) would be different.

Wait, but wait again. Let me check.

Original Equations:

2. ∇ · B = 0

Modified:

2. ∇ · B = μ₀ρ_m (or similar)

Original Faraday's Law:

3. ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

Modified Faraday's Law:

3. ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

And perhaps Ampère's Law stays the same unless we count displacement current in some way. 

But Ampère's Law in our universe has the displacement current term (∂E/∂t), so already accommodating time-varying electric fields. The analogous term for ∂B/∂t is in Faraday's Law. So maybe Ampère's Law doesn't require modification. Therefore, equation 4 remains as it is.

Thus, in this scenario, Equations 2 and 3 are different from the regular Maxwell's equations.

Therefore, the answer is Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ · B = 0 becomes ∇ · B = magnetic charge density term) and Faraday's Law of Induction (which gains a magnetic current term). Hence, equations 2 and 3.

But according to the question wording: "specifically, which of those equations are different?" So out of the four Maxwell equations, which ones. If the standard set is four, in the parallel universe, which need to be changed. Based on this analysis, equations 2 and 3. So Gauss's Law for magnetism is one, Faraday's Law is the other. But I need to make sure.

Alternatively, sometimes when magnetic monopoles are considered, Ampère's Law is also modified. Wait, Wait. Let's think in terms of units as well.

Suppose in SI units, Maxwell's equations are as written:

1. ∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀

2. ∇ ⋅ B = 0

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

With magnetic monopoles, let's have magnetic charge density ρ_m and magnetic current density J_m. Then:

1. ∇ ⋅ E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ ⋅ B = ρ_m * some constant

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m * some constant

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Here, equation 4 remains same. However in some formulations, if you extend duality even further, you can have complete symmetry between E and B by including additional terms. For example, if you consider hypothetical magnetic monopoles, you might have: 

∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J'_m?

No, that would complicate the units. Probably, if magnetic charges and currents are present, we modify equations 2 and 3.

Therefore, my conclusion is that Gauss's Law for Magnetism (Equation 2) changes from ∇ ⋅ B = 0 to ∇ ⋅ B = μ₀ρ_m (assuming appropriate units), and Faraday's Law (Equation 3) changes ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t to include a term for the magnetic current density, such as ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m.

Therefore, two equations are different: Equation 2 and Equation 3.

But the original question asks, in a universe where "a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole," which of Maxwell's equations are different. The mention of isolated poles refers to the existence of magnetic monopoles, which would affect Gauss's Law for Magnetism. But does it require changing Faraday's Law? Sometimes in derivations, even if ρ_m exists, if J_m is zero, you don't need to modify Faraday's Law. But in dynamic situations, even if you have ρ_m, movement implies J_m, and to be consistent with charge conservation∇ ⋅ J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t = 0, Maxwell's equation for ∇ × E should include J_m.

Therefore, if in this parallel universe magnetic charges exist and can be isolated (so also can move), then Maxwell's equations must be extended to account for both ρ_m and J_m, meaning both Equations 2 and 3 are modified. However, if the universe only allows for static magnetic monopoles (no movement), then only Gauss's Law would change. But in reality, Maxwell's equations need to be consistent with conservation of charges, time-varying fields, etc., so J_m would exist if ρ_m can vary with time. Thus, in standard theory when introducing monopoles, both equations 2 and 3 are modified. Hence, the answer is Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law.

Therefore, the specific equations that differ are Gauss’s Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law.


**Final Answer**

The Maxwell equations that would be different are Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law of Induction. These are expressed as:

\boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}

4. **Ampère-Maxwell Law**: Electric currents and changing electric fields produce magnetic fields. The equation is ∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t.

Now, in a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, that means there are isolated North and South poles. So, this should affect the equations related to the magnetic field. Specifically, Gauss's Law for Magnetism states that there are no magnetic monopoles because the divergence of B is zero. If there were monopoles, then ∇ · B would equal some magnetic charge density, similar to how Gauss's Law for Electricity works.

So does that mean only Gauss's Law for Magnetism would change? Let me check the other equations. Faraday's Law relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B. If monopoles exist, maybe there would be a magnetic current term? Similarly, Ampère's Law might also get a term related to magnetic current if there's a symmetry.

Wait, in the original equations, Faraday's Law is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic monopoles, maybe if there's a magnetic current, this equation could have an additional term. Similarly, Ampère's Law might have a term with the magnetic current density.

But in the problem statement, they just mention the existence of isolated poles. So maybe only Gauss's Law for Magnetism would change, but Faraday's equation would remain the same? Wait, no.

The exact form would depend on how the units are defined, but at minimum, we can say that ∇ · B becomes non-zero.

If symmetry is considered, maybe Ampère's Law would also have a term for magnetic current. Wait, how does this symmetry work?

In our equations, when magnetic monopoles are introduced, the equations become symmetric. So, in such a case:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity remains ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism becomes ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m.

3. Faraday's Law becomes ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m.

4. Ampère's Law becomes ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

But I need to verify that. Wait, in some formulations when magnetic monopoles are considered, Faraday's Law does get a term with magnetic current, and Ampère's Law might depend on the time derivative of the electric field. Alternatively, perhaps the signs and constants differ.

I'm contemplating a question regarding Maxwell's equations in an alternate universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) exist. I need to determine which equations would be altered in such a scenario. Let me begin by reviewing the standard Maxwell's equations before considering the implications of magnetic monopoles.

The four standard Maxwell's equations are:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**: The electric flux through a closed surface equals the enclosed charge divided by the permittivity constant. Mathematically: ∇ · E = ρ/ε₀.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: The magnetic flux through any closed surface equals zero, reflecting the absence of magnetic monopoles in our universe. This is expressed as ∇ · B = 0.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: A time-varying magnetic field generates an electric field, expressed as ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t.

4. **Ampère-Maxwell Law**: Electric currents and changing electric fields create magnetic fields, written as ∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t.

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, Gauss's Law for Magnetism would certainly change. Instead of the divergence of B equaling zero, it would equal some magnetic charge density, similar to how Gauss's Law for Electricity functions. So ∇ · B would become proportional to a magnetic charge density ρ_m.

But would other equations change too? If we have magnetic charges, their movement would constitute a magnetic current, analogous to electric current. This suggests that Faraday's Law might acquire an additional term related to magnetic current J_m. Similarly, Ampère's Law might be modified to maintain symmetry between electric and magnetic phenomena.

According to Dirac's theory of magnetic monopoles, the modified equations would be:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity remains unchanged: ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism becomes: ∇ · B = μ₀ρ_m (or proportional to ρ_m with some constant)

3. Faraday's Law is modified to: ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀J_m (including a magnetic current term)

4. Ampère's Law remains: ∇ × B = μ₀J_e + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t (though some formulations might modify this too)

The exact constants and signs in these equations might vary depending on how units are defined in this theoretical framework, but at minimum, Gauss's Law for Magnetism would become non-zero, and Faraday's Law would likely include a magnetic current term.

Alright, so I have a question regarding Maxwell's equations in an alternate universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. I'm trying to determine which of Maxwell's equations would be altered under such conditions. Let's start by recalling the standard Maxwell's equations and consider the impact of magnetic monopoles on them.

Firstly, here are the four Maxwell's equations as originally formulated:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**: The electric flux across a closed surface is linked to the enclosed charge. This is represented as ∇ · E = ρ/ε₀.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: There is zero magnetic flux through any closed surface, based on the absence of magnetic monopoles; thus, ∇ · B = 0.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: It states that a varying magnetic field generates an electric field, depicted by ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t.

4. **Ampère-Maxwell Law**: This states that magnetic fields are generated by electric currents and changing electric fields, expressed as ∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t.

In a universe allowing for magnetic monopoles, isolated North and South magnetic poles must exist, affecting magnetic field-related equations. Gauss's Law for Magnetism claims no presence of monopoles due to a zero divergence of B. With the existence of monopoles, ∇ · B would correlate with a magnetic charge density, akin to Gauss's Law for Electricity.

Would Gauss's Law for Magnetism alone change? Let's examine other equations. Faraday's Law ties the curl of E to B's time derivative. The presence of monopoles might necessitate a magnetic current term. Similarly, symmetry could require Ampère's Law to include a term for magnetic currents.

Currently, Faraday's Law is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. The introduction of magnetic monopoles might mean including an additional term involving magnetic current. Ampère's Law could similarly gain an extra component for magnetic current density.

From the problem, the mention of isolated poles indicates more changes than just Gauss's Law for Magnetism. If magnetic charges move, they form a magnetic current, like electric charges form electric current. Hence, both Ampère's Law and Faraday's Law could acquire new terms.

Now, taking it step by step: In our universe, B's divergence is zero due to the lack of magnetic monopoles. If they exist, ∇ · B might be linked to a magnetic charge density, ρ_m, altering Gauss's Law for Magnetism to ∇ · B = μ₀ρ_m, similar to Gauss's Law for electricity, though constants may differ. In electricity, the constant is 1/ε₀. Magnetic relationships might employ a different constant, possibly μ₀, with unit definitions dictating the specifics. Most importantly, ∇ · B would no longer be zero.

If magnetic charges move, forming a magnetic current, J_m, Faraday's Law involving E's curl, now equal to B's time derivative, might get a J_m term. Ampère's Law, currently featuring electric current J, would similarly gain a magnetic current component if symmetry is maintained.

For our equations, introducing magnetic monopoles brings symmetry:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity remains as ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism modifies to ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m.

3. Faraday's Law adjusts to ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m.

4. Ampère's Law adjusts to ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

However, it requires validation: in some cases adding magnetic monopoles, Faraday's Law indeed has a magnetic current term, and Ampère's Law's modifications depend on the electric field's time derivative. The signs and constants might vary.

If magnetic charge density is involved, Gauss's Law for magnetism might become ∇ · B = ρ_m (with potential constants). Faraday’s Law would then feature a magnetic current term. Theoretical extensions of Maxwell’s equations embracing magnetic monopoles modify both Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law. Ampère’s Law might retain its form unless linked to displacement current in magnetic fields. Still, generally, Ampère's Law undergoes modifications to include magnetic currents.

According to Dirac's magnetic monopole theory, a magnetic charge density is indeed integrated into Gauss's Law for magnetism, and Faraday's Law is supplemented by a magnetic current term. Thus:

Original Equations:

∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

∇ · B = 0

∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

With Monopoles:

∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m (or with an appropriate constant)

So for full symmetry between electricity and magnetism, all four equations would be modified, but in reality, if only magnetic monopoles are introduced, maybe two equations change: Gauss for B and Faraday's Law.\n\nAlternatively, some sources state that in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become:\n\n∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀\n\n∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m\n\n∇ × E = -μ₀ J_m - ∂B/∂t\n\n∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t\n\nYes, that's a common way to write them. So with the addition of a magnetic charge density ρ_m and a magnetic current density J_m, Gauss's Law for magnetism becomes similar to that for electricity, and Faraday's Law gains a term proportional to the magnetic current.\n\nBut in the original question, the universe simply has isolated North/South poles. So, does that mean just the existence of magnetic charges (i.e. ∇ · B ≠ 0), hence modifying Gauss’s Law, and possibly introducing a magnetic current term in Faraday's Law? If magnetic charges can move, they would produce a magnetic current, which would affect the Faraday's Law?\n\nAlternatively, the problem may not consider the dynamics of moving magnetic charges (i.e., no magnetic current), only the existence of magnetic charges. But Maxwell's equations need to be consistent. If there are magnetic charges, even stationary ones, then Gauss's Law for magnetism would have a magnetic charge density. If they are moving, then ∇ × E would need a term related to the magnetic current to preserve the continuity equation.\n\nBecause in electromagnetism, the continuity equation for electric charge is ∇ · J + ∂ρ/∂t = 0. For magnetic monopoles, similarly, we would have ∇ · J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t = 0. For Faraday's Law, if we take the divergence of ∇ × E, it must be zero (since divergence of a curl is zero). In the original Faraday’s Law, ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. Taking divergence gives 0 = -∂(∇ · B)/∂t. But if ∇ · B = ρ_m..., then 0 = -∂ρ_m/∂t, which would imply that ρ_m is constant in time, which is not true if there are currents. So to correct this, you need to add a term to Faraday's Law so that taking the divergence would give the continuity equation.\n\nTherefore, in order to maintain the conservation of magnetic charge, Faraday's Law needs to include the magnetic current. Thus, ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (times a constant), which when taking the divergence gives ∇ · J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t = 0, which is the continuity equation for magnetic charge.\n\nTherefore, in such a universe with magnetic monopoles, both Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law would be modified. So among Maxwell's equations, equations 2 and 3 would look different. Gauss’s Law for magnetism (equation 2) would have a non-zero divergence, and Faraday's Law (equation 3) would have an additional magnetic current term.\n\nBut then in Ampère's Law? Let's see. Ampère's Law in our universe is ∇ × B = μ₀J_e + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t. If there was complete symmetry between electric and magnetic fields, you might add a displacement current for the magnetic field. Wait, but displacement current is part of Ampère's Law. However, Ampère's Law already exists as accounting for the displacement current (the ∂E/∂t term). But magnetic monopoles would not necessarily affect Ampère's Law unless you are introducing dual terms. Wait, unless you consider that variations in the magnetic charge might produce an effect on the electric field similar to how electric charge affects the magnetic field. But no, in the usual formulation, the existence of magnetic monopoles would not add a term to Ampère's Law. Instead, Ampère's Law would remain as is, but with possible contributions from the displacement current as usual.\n\nThus, only Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law would change. Therefore, the equations that are different in the presence of magnetic monopoles (isolated poles) would be Gauss’s Law for Magnetism and Faraday’s Law.\n\nBut let me check that another way. Let's say there is a magnetic charge density ρ_m and a magnetic current J_m. Then:\n\n1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)\n\n2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m (changed)\n\n3. ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (changed)\n\n4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (unchanged, since Ampère's Law is only about electric current and displacement current)\n\nTherefore, out of the four equations, equations 2 and 3 are modified. So the answer would be Gauss’s Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law.\n\nBut the original question is probably expecting the answer that only the divergence equations are different, but Faraday and Ampère also? Wait, I remember Dirac added to both.\n\nWait, in some references, when monopoles are present, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So, the four equations are:\n\n1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀\n\n2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m\n\n3. ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m\n\n4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + ... something?\n\nWait, no. Typically in symmetric Maxwell equations with monopoles, you would have:\n\n∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀\n\n∇ · B = ρ_m / (something)\n\nFor the units, if you want symmetrical equations, you can write:\n\n∇ · E = 4π ρ_e (in Gaussian units)\n\n∇ · B = 4π ρ_m\n\nThen,\n\n∇ × E = - (1/c) (∂B/∂t) - (4π/c) J_m\n\n∇ × B = (4π/c) J_e + (1/c) ∂E/∂t\n\nBut this is in Gaussian units, which are more symmetrical. In SI units, things get more complicated.\n\nIn SI units, Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles:\n\n∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀\n\n∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m\n\n∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m\n\n∇ × B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e\n\nSo yes, in SI units, introducing magnetic charges ρ_m and magnetic current J_m modifies Gauss’s law for B and adds a term to Faraday’s law.\n\nHence, the equations that change are Gauss’s Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law. Ampère's Law remains the same as before, but if magnetic current was a thing, then actually, perhaps displacement current appears as part of Ampère's Law? Wait, in our original equations, Ampère’s Law already includes the displacement current term (∂E/∂t). The existence of J_m would not affect Ampère’s Law, only Faraday’s. So per definitions, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, you have:\n\n- Modified ∇ · B to include ρ_m, and\n\n- Modified Faraday’s Law to include J_m.\n\nThus, Maxwell’s equations that would differ are the second and third ones: Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the Gauss’s Law for Magnetism and Faraday’s Law of Induction are different in a universe with isolated magnetic poles.

Let me check.\n\nNo, Ampère’s Law deals with the electric current and the displacement current (time derivative of E field). The presence of magnetic charge doesn't directly affect Ampère’s Law. So Ampère’s Law remains the same, except with its own terms.

In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, **Gauss's Law for Magnetism** and **Faraday's Law of Induction** would be modified. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:  
   Original:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
   \]  
   Modified to include magnetic charge density \(\rho_m\):  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m
   \]

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**:  
   Original:  
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
   \]  
   Modified to account for magnetic current density \(\mathbf{J}_m\):  
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m
   \]

The other two equations, **Gauss's Law for Electricity** and the **Ampère-Maxwell Law**, remain unchanged if only magnetic monopoles (and not their dynamics) are introduced. However, if magnetic currents are included for full symmetry, their forms would still primarily involve electric fields and currents.

**Answer**:  
The modified equations are **Gauss's Law for Magnetism** and **Faraday's Law**.  
In notation:  
- \(\boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m}\)  
- \(\boxed{\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}\)

 some formulations use different constants)

∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

But here, the modification is to both Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law. Whereas Ampère's Law remains the same unless you are considering some symmetric version, but normally, even with magnetic monopoles, Ampère's Law is about the electric current.

Alternatively, the problem may not consider the dynamics of moving magnetic charges (i.e., no magnetic current), only the existence of magnetic charges. But Maxwell's equations need to be consistent. If there are magnetic charges, even stationary ones, then Gauss's Law for magnetism would have a magnetic charge density. If they are moving, then ∇ × E would need a term related to the magnetic current to preserve the continuity equation.

Because in electromagnetism, the continuity equation for electric charge is ∇ · J + ∂ρ/∂t = 0. For magnetic monopoles, similarly, we would have ∇ · J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t = 0. For Faraday's Law, if we take the divergence of ∇ × E, it must be zero (since divergence of a curl is zero). In the original Faraday’s Law, ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. Taking divergence gives 0 = -∂(∇ · B)/∂t. But if ∇ · B = ρ_m..., then 0 = -∂ρ_m/∂t, which would imply that ρ_m is constant in time, which is not true if there are currents. So to correct this, you need to add a term to Faraday's Law so that taking the divergence would give the continuity equation.

Therefore, in order to maintain the conservation of magnetic charge, Faraday's Law needs to include the magnetic current. Thus, ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (times a constant), which when taking the divergence gives ∇ · J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t = 0, which is the continuity equation for magnetic charge.

Therefore, in such a universe with magnetic monopoles, both Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law would be modified. So among Maxwell's equations, equations 2 and 3 would look different. Gauss’s Law for magnetism (equation 2) would have a non-zero divergence, and Faraday's Law (equation 3) would have an additional magnetic current term.

But then in Ampère's Law? Let's see. Ampère's Law in our universe is ∇ × B = μ₀J_e + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t. If there was complete symmetry between electric and magnetic fields, you might add a displacement current for the magnetic field. Wait, but displacement current is part of Ampère's Law. However, Ampère's Law already exists as accounting for the displacement current (the ∂E/∂t term). But magnetic monopoles would not necessarily affect Ampère's Law unless you are introducing dual terms.

Thus, only Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law would change. Therefore, the equations that are different in the presence of magnetic monopoles (isolated poles) would be Gauss’s Law for Magnetism and Faraday’s Law.

But let me check that another way. Let's say there is a magnetic charge density ρ_m and a magnetic current J_m. Then:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)

2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m (changed)

3. ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (changed)

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (unchanged, since Ampère's Law is only about electric current and displacement current)

Therefore, out of the four equations, equations 2 and 3 are modified. So the answer would be Gauss’s Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law.

But the original question is probably expecting the answer that only the divergence equations are different, but Faraday and Ampère also? Wait, I remember Dirac added to both.

Wait, in some references, when monopoles are present, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So, the four equations are:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + ... something?

Wait, no. Typically in symmetric Maxwell equations with monopoles, you would have:

∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

∇ · B = ρ_m / (something)

For the units, if you want symmetrical equations, you can write:

∇ · E = 4π ρ_e (in Gaussian units)

∇ · B = 4π ρ_m

Then,

∇ × E = - (1/c) (∂B/∂t) - (4π/c) J_m

∇ × B = (4π/c) J_e + (1/c) ∂E/∂t

But this is in Gaussian units, which are more symmetrical. In SI units, things get more complicated.

In SI units, Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles:

∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m

∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

∇ × B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

So yes, in SI units, introducing magnetic charges ρ_m and magnetic current J_m modifies Gauss’s law for B and adds a term to Faraday’s law.

Hence, the equations that change are Gauss’s Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law. Ampère's Law remains the same as before, but if magnetic current was a thing, then actually, perhaps displacement current appears as part of Ampère's Law? Wait, in our original equations, Ampère’s Law already includes the displacement current term (∂E/∂t). The existence of J_m would not affect Ampère’s Law, only Faraday’s. So per definitions, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, you have:

- Modified ∇ · B to include ρ_m, and

- Modified Faraday’s Law to include J_m.

Thus, Maxwell’s equations that would differ are the second and third ones: Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law.

Therefore, the answer is the Gauss’s Law for Magnetism and Faraday’s Law of Induction are different in a universe with isolated magnetic poles. Specifically, Gauss’s Law for Magnetism gains a magnetic charge density term, and Faraday’s Law includes a magnetic current term.

In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations are modified to accommodate magnetic charge density (\( \rho_m \)) and magnetic current (\( \mathbf{J}_m \)). The changes are as follows:

1. **Gauss’s Law for Magnetism** (originally \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \)) now includes a term for magnetic charge density:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m
   \]
   This reflects the existence of isolated magnetic poles.

2. **Faraday’s Law of Induction** (originally \( \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \)) gains a magnetic current term:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m
   \]
   This accounts for the contribution of moving magnetic charges to the electric field.

The other two equations, **Gauss’s Law for Electricity** and the **Ampère-Maxwell Law**, remain unchanged because they describe electric charges and currents, which are unaffected by the presence of magnetic monopoles. Thus:

- \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0} \) (unchanged).
- \( \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_e + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \) (unchanged).

**Summary**: The equations that change are **Gauss’s Law for Magnetism** and **Faraday’s Law**.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 This introduces a duality between electric and magnetic phenomena, leading to more symmetrical equations.

I should verify that by accounting for magnetic charge density and current, the other equations are adjusted to preserve the conservation of magnetic charge, just as electric charge conservation is enforced via the continuity equation connected to Maxwell's equations.

Another point is that introducing a ρ_m would lead to a continuity equation for magnetic charge: ∇ · J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t = 0, analogous to ∇ · J + ∂ρ/∂t = 0 for electric charge. To maintain this, the modification to Faraday's Law is necessary because without it, there would be a missing term.

Thus, in conclusion, in a universe with isolated magnetic poles (monopoles), Maxwell's equations would see changes primarily in Gauss's Law for Magnetism (so equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3), with the introduction of magnetic charge density and magnetic current into those equations. Ampère's Law might remain as is or get a symmetric term if considering displacement currents for magnetism as well, but commonly, it's the former two equations that are adjusted. Therefore, equations 2 ∇ · B = 0 and 3 ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t would be different. Wait, wouldn't the Ampère's Law change as well? Let's think again.

Typically, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the four equations take on a more symmetric form:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ · B = μ₀ρ_m

3. ∇ × E = - μ₀J_m - ∂B/∂t

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀J_e

Ah, so actually Faraday's Law gets a magnetic current term (J_m) and Ampère's Law is similar. So, equations 2, 3, and 4 may be modified. Wait, in the standard Ampère's Law, we have ∇ × B = μ₀J_e + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t. If we added a magnetic current term, where would it fit? No, actually, the Ampère's Law relates electric currents and displacement currents to the magnetic field. There is a symmetry if we consider magnetic displacement currents, but in the standard treatment, including magnetic monopoles, only the Ampère's Law remains as is, and Faraday's Law gains a term. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to check. Suppose we have two continuity equations, one for electric charge ∇ · J_e + ∂ρ_e/∂t = 0, and another for magnetic charge ∇ · J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t = 0. Then, the modified Maxwell equations require that both E and B fields have their Gauss's laws with their respective charges, and Faraday's and Ampère's laws adjusted to account for the currents. Let me recall the standard approach.

In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations become:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Thus, in this arrangement, equations 2 (Gauss's Law for Magnetism) and 3 (Faraday's Law) are altered. The Ampère's Law (4) remains the same because Ampère's Law is related to electric currents and displacement currents, not magnetic ones. However, Faraday's Law now has a term representing a magnetic current, which breaks the symmetry in the equations. If we aimed for full symmetry, maybe even Ampère's Law would change, but I believe that typically only equations 2 and 3 are affected. Let me confirm with a logical check. 

Without magnetic monopoles, the inconsistency (curl of E) comes from changing B. If there were a magnetic current, then that would also contribute to the curl of E. Similarly, if B had a divergence (monopoles), equation 2 changes.

Thus, most certainly, Gauss's Law for Magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3) must change. Ampère's Law (equation 4) remains as it was because its sources are electric, not magnetic.

But actually, if we go full symmetry, Ampère's Law could have the displacement current, while the displacement 'magnetic current' would be present in Faraday's Law. Wait, Faraday's Law is about the curl of E related to the time derivative of B. To also have a current of monopoles (moving magnetic charges) changing B, so the equation might require an extra term. That does happen, explaining why Faraday's Law (equation 3) becomes ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m. That seems right.

Therefore, out of the four Maxwell equations, equations 2 and 3 are modified. Equations 1 and 4 remain the same. Thus, in the alternate universe, Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law are different. Let me check a source to confirm.

[Logic Check]

Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles are often written as:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ · B = ρ_m (maybe divided by a constant)

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

Depending on unit conventions, the exact form can vary, but yes, typically equations 2 and 3 change. Ampère's Law doesn't have a magnetic term because it's the electric current and electric displacement; Faraday's Law does have the magnetic current in addition to the changing B field.

Therefore, the answer should be that Gauss’s Law for Magnetism (second equation) and Faraday’s Law (third equation) are different in the presence of magnetic monopoles.

Similarly, the divergence of J_e plus the time derivative of ρ_e must be zero. So symmetry here.\n\nHence, if such is the case, then:\n\n∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m (denoting maybe the necessity of including J_m, with appropriate constants).\n\nBut usually, in SI units, the modified equations when including magnetic monopoles are:\n\n∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀\n\n∇ · B = ρ_m / μ₀\n\n∇ × E = - μ₀ J_m - ∂B/∂t\n\n∇ × H = J_e + ∂D / ∂t\n\nBut H and B can be related through B = μ₀ (H + M), which complicates the constants.\n\nAlternatively, if only free charges are considered, perhaps the modification is purely to introduce a term where missing.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is that two equations change: Gauss\'s Law for Magnetism (∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m instead of 0) and Faraday\'s Law (which gains a term depending on the magnetic current). However, then Ampère\'s Law would already include displacement current, so unless introducing a magnetic displacement current, but that might not be the case. Typically, Ampère\'s Law stays as is, and if there is a magnetic current, it enters into Faraday\'s Law along with B\'s time derivative; whereas Gauss\'s Law becomes similar to electric Gauss Law. So, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, Gauss\'s Law for magnetism and Faraday\'s Law would be different. \n\nWait, Maxwell\'s equations in presence of magnetic charges and currents are often stated as:\n\n1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀\n\n2. ∇ · B = ρ_m\n\n3. ∇ × E = - J_m - ∂B/∂t\n\n4. ∇ × B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e\n\nBut units can vary. So expected that equations 2 and 3 would be changed.\n\nAlternatively, Jackson\'s Classical Electrodynamics book discusses this (Chapter 6). Let\'s recall. Jackson indeed introduces magnetic charge and current density. The modified Maxwell equations become:\n\n∇ · D = ρ_e\n\n∇ · B = ρ_m\n\n∇ × E = - J_m - ∂B / ∂t\n\n∇ × H = J_e + ∂D / ∂ t\n\nAssuming B = μ₀ H, and D = ε₀ E for free space.\n\nIn that scenario, without constitutive relations, Maxwell\'s equations gain symmetric terms. Therefore, two equations divergences (Gauss laws), and two curl equations include the new sources. \n\nTherefore, in this case:\n\nIn free space:\n\n1. Gauss\'s Law: ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀\n\n2. Gauss\'s Law for magnetism: ∇ · B = ρ_m (rho_m is the magnetic charge density)\n\n3. Faraday\'s Law: ∇ × E = - ∂ B / ∂ t - J_m (magnetic current density J_m)\n\n4. Ampère\'s Law: ∇ × B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂ E / ∂ t + μ₀ J_e\n\nTherefore, original Ampère\'s Law now would have the displacement current but also the regular current, and Faraday\'s Law with an extra term for magnetic current.\n\nThus, in the standard formulation for our universe, Ampère\'s Law includes the displacement current, but without magnetic terms. By contrast, when establishing "magnetic monopoles" existence, both Gauss\'s Law for B and Faraday\'s Law change. Also, in the presence of J_m? Therefore, which equations actually differ from ours?\n\nOriginal Summary:\n\n1. ∇ · E = ρ / ε₀.\n\n2. ∇ · B = 0.\n\n3. ∇ × E = - ∂ B / ∂ t.\n\n4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂ E / ∂ t.\n\nWith monopoles:\n\n1st equation same (maybe).\n\n2nd equation now ∇ · B = ρ_m (or proportional), breaking the zero divergence.\n\n3rd equation, adds a term from the magnetic current.\n\n4th equation not directly has source from monopole currents. Wait: no, Ampère\'s equation can remain as-is in terms of electric currents and displacement current, unless there\'s a consideration of magnetic currents interacting as well, but the Ampère\'s Law is agnostic unless coupled.\n\nHmm, according to the adjustment made, Ampère\'s Law retains J_e and the displacement current, while Faraday\'s Law gets an additional term from J_m.\n\nThus the only Major changes are made to Equations 2 and 3. Meanwhile, Equations 1 and 4 are unaltered if the E field is due to electric charges and the B field due to magnetic charges and currents.\n\nWait, but in that case, if Maxwell\'s equations become symmetric in the presence of magnetic monopoles:\n\n1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀ (Original)\n\n2. ∇ · B = ρ_m / μ₀ (Modified)\n\n3. ∇ × E = - μ₀ J_m - ∂B/∂t (Modified)\n\n4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t  (Original Ampère\'s Law since it uses J_e)\n\nBut actually, No, because Ampère\'s Law should maintain symmetry. If magnetic currents induce a displacement current similar to electric displacement, but this is getting into more intricate adjustments.\n\nHowever, generally, Maxwell\'s equations when incorporating monopoles only require modifying two equations: Gauss\'s Law for B (from ∇ · B = 0 to ∇ · B = ρ_m ), and a current term in Faraday\'s Law. Ampère\'s Law originally had the displacement current added by Maxwell, so possibly that term allows J_e and ∂E/∂t to exist. By symmetry, ∇ × E would need a J_m term when time variation of B exists, just as ∇ × H includes J and displacement.\n\nBut definitively: from what\'s commonly written when extending Maxwell\'s equations:\n\nThe presence of magnetic charge density ρ_m and current J_m modifies two of Maxwell\'s equations—Gauss\'s Law for magnetism becomes ∇ · B = ρ_m (or with a constant), and Faraday\'s Law incorporates the magnetic current density, making ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m (again, considering units). \n\nAmpère\'s Circuital Law and Gauss\'s Law for electricity remain as before. But to check this:\n\nIn the original Maxwell\'s, to get the inconsistency, if you take the divergence of Ampère\'s Law (∇ · (∇ × B) = 0 = μ₀ ∇ · J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂ (∇ · E)/∂t), leading to the continuity equation: ∇ · J + ∂ρ/∂t = 0.\n\nIn a similar fashion, if in Faraday\'s Law, you take divergence: ∇ · (∇ × E) = 0 = - ∂(∇ · B)/∂t - ∇ · J_m. If ∇ · B = ρ_m, then 0 = - ∂ρ_m/∂t - ∇ · J_m, leading to ∇ · J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t =0, the continuity equation for magnetic charge. So, accordingly, these equations need to be modified.\n\nTherefore:\n\nGauss\'s Law for B receives a magnetic charge density term.\n\nFaraday\'s Law receives a magnetic current density term.\n\nAs a result, with the presence of magnetic monopoles, Gauss\'s Law for magnetism (which previously stated the absence of monopoles) would be modified, and Faraday\'s Law (which will account for any magnetic current) is adjusted. The other two equations (Gauss\'s Law for E and Ampère\'s Law) remain the same. So Faraday\'s and Gauss\'s Law are affected. Therefore, original equations 2, and 3 are affected.\n\nBut hold on, in the Maxwell\'s equations set, in our original equations, Ampère\'s Law was ∇ × B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (the Ampère-Maxwell Law). If you introduce magnetic currents, would it complicate Ampère\'s Law? According to the previous consideration, maybe not directly, since J in Ampère\'s Law is the electric current. The Ampère\'s Law modification paired with displacement current remains. Thus Gauss\'s Law for B and Faraday\'s Law are amended, while the other two stay the same. Therefore in this alternate universe, Maxwell\'s Equations 2 and 3 are different.\n\nBut perhaps H-fields are involved. If we use H and E, etc., but if free space is considered, then it should still hold as before.\n\nThus, the answer should specifically note that Gauss\'s Law for Magnetism: ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m, and Faraday\'s Law of Induction: ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m. So the second and third equation.\n\nHowever, depending on the unit conventions, the exact form can differ, but the key point is that Gauss\'s Law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday\'s Law equation (equation 3) change. In the original equations in SI units, equations (2) ∇ · B = 0 and (3) ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t. In the alternate universe with monopoles, equation 2 gains a magnetic charge density term, and equation 3 contains a magnetic current term. Neither Gauss\'s Law for electricity nor Ampère\'s Law requires modification here if only magnetic charges and currents are introduced. However, in natural unit systems, these equations are more symmetric. But within standard Maxwell\'s framework, where Fara\'s Law and Ampère\'s Law are supposed to mirror each other in terms of time derivatives giving rise to the curl of the other field, with monopoles, the symmetry would require further adjustments.\n\nBut in step-by-step thinking, in the problem statement, the user might be expecting to recall that without magnetic monopoles, ∇ · B = 0 and ∇ × B\'s relation, but with monopoles, ∇ · B ≠ 0, and Faraday\'s gets a term. So most likely, equations 2 (Gauss magnetism) and 3 (Faraday) are changed.\n\nTherefore, answer is: Gauss\'s Law for Magnetism and Faraday\'s Law. Hence the equations that change are equation 2 (∇ · B = 4πρ_m) and equation 3 (∇ × E = ... )\n\nWait, again goes back to units. In Gaussian units, Maxwell\'s equations have factors of 4π. If the question expects the answer from a Gaussian units perspective, then ∇ · B = 4πρ_m. But often in SI units, the modification is ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m, and Faraday\'s Law becomes ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m.\n\nBut remembering from the differential equations from the original Maxwell\'s equations as they are written in SI units, in natural units, which equations change.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nOriginal Maxwell\'s equations (SI units):\n\n1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀\n\n2. ∇ · B = 0\n\n3. ∇ × E = - ∂B / ∂t\n\n4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E / ∂t\n\nWith magnetic monopoles present, Maxwell\'s equations become modified to:\n\n1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)\n\n2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m (since magnetic charge density now exists)\n\n3. ∇ × E = - ∂B / ∂t - μ₀ J_m (additional term for the magnetic current density J_m)\n\n4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E / ∂t (unchanged except for possible consideration if you need to include magnetic displacement currents, but usually not, keep Ampère\'s Law as the existing one with J_e and displacement current).\n\nTherefore, in this setup, equations 2 and 3 would be modified compared to the standard Maxwell\'s equations, while equations 1 and 4 would remain untouched. Thus, in the alternate universe where magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell\'s equations specifically differing would be Gauss\'s Law for Magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday\'s Law (equation 3). Ampère\'s Law doesn\'t directly involve magnetic monopoles unless currents J_m affect H fields.\n\nHence, the answered equations that are different would be equations (2) Gauss’s Law for magnetism and (3) Faraday’s Law of Induction.\n\nBut to confirm:\n\nAlternatively, in many references, when adding magnetic charges, Maxwell\'s equations receive modification to two of them: Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇ · B = ρ_m (scaled by constants) and Faraday’s law includes the magnetic current term. Ampère’s law is modified if monopole currents are included.\n\nWait, but if you have moving magnetic charges, you get J_m. Then in order to have the proper continuity equation (conservation of magnetic charge), then [∇ × E] = - ∂B/∂t - J_m.\n\nIn our universe, without magnetic charges, J_m is zero and so ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t.\n\nSo Faraday\'s Law is adjusted here. However, Ampère’s Law is about the generation of B-fields due to currents and time-varying E; unless the motion of magnetic charges affects Ampère\'s Law—that seems not directly (since B is generated by electric currents and displacement currents in as per Ampère-Maxwell).\n\nBut logical checks: Suppose B exists, created maybe both by electric currents and via some relationship with a magnetic charge. If J_e is for electric currents, J_m adds into Faraday\'s Law. \n\nConclusion: Gauss\'s Law for Magnetism and Faraday\'s Law are modified.\n\nHence, the answer should note that Gauss\'s Law for Magnetism (originally ∇ · B = 0) now has ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m, and Faraday\'s Law (originally ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t) now includes a term related to magnetic current, i.e., ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m. Thus, these two equations would be different from our universe\'s Maxwell equations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nIn a universe with isolated magnetic poles, the modified Maxwell equations are Gauss\'s Law for Magnetism and Faraday\'s Law.

In our universe, Maxwell's equations are:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**: \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}\)
2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0\)
3. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\)
4. **Ampère-Maxwell Law**: \(\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_e + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\)

In a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, the presence of isolated magnetic charges (monopoles) and magnetic currents modifies some of these equations. The key changes are:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism** is no longer zero because magnetic charge density \(\rho_m\) exists. It becomes:

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction** includes an additional term for magnetic current density \(\mathbf{J}_m\), leading to:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m
   \]

These modifications introduce symmetry between the electric and magnetic fields. The other two equations, Gauss's Law for Electricity and the Ampère-Maxwell Law, remain unchanged in this context.

### Final Answer
The specific equations that change in the presence of isolated magnetic poles are:

\[
\boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m \quad \text{and} \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}
\]

∇ × E = - ∂B / ∂t - μ₀ J_m

∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E / ∂t + ... ?

Wait, actually, sources say that adding monopoles changes Gauss's Law for B and Ampere's Law but wait hold on.

Wait, let's double-check. The inclusion of magnetic monopoles leads to (following standard theoretical models):

Gauss's Law for B: ∇ · B = ρ_m (or proportionality as per unit system)

Faraday’s Law would become ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t − J_m (magnetic current)

Ampère’s Law would then mirror this by adding the displacement current. So perhaps:

∇ × H = J_e + ∂ D / ∂ t

With analogy to magnetic monopoles, ∇ × E might involve magnetic current.

Wait, better check references. Historically, with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations take a symmetric form where divergence of B equals magnetic charge density, and Faraday's law includes a term related to magnetic current density.

So the equations become:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)

2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m (modified)

3. ∇ × E = - μ₀ J_m - ∂B / ∂t (additional term for magnetic current)

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E / ∂t (already includes displacement current; perhaps now augmented)

But wait, if we have magnetic charge, then by the continuity equation, the divergence of J_m plus the time derivative of ρ_m must be zero. Similarly, the divergence of J_e plus the time derivative of ρ_e must be zero. So symmetry here.

Hence, if such is the case, then:

∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m (denoting maybe the necessity of including J_m, with appropriate constants).

But usually, in SI units, the modified equations when including magnetic monopoles are:

∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

∇ · B = ρ_m / μ₀

∇ × E = - μ₀ J_m - ∂B/∂t

∇ × H = J_e + ∂D / ∂t

But H and B can be related through B = μ₀ (H + M), which complicates the constants.

Alternatively, if only free charges are considered, perhaps the modification is purely to introduce a term where missing.

But perhaps the answer is that two equations change: Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m instead of 0) and Faraday's Law (which gains a term depending on the magnetic current). However, then Ampère's Law would already include displacement current, so unless introducing a magnetic displacement current, but that might not be the case. Typically, Ampère's Law stays as is, and if there is a magnetic current, it enters into Faraday's Law along with B's time derivative; whereas Gauss's Law becomes similar to electric Gauss Law. So, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law would be different. 

Wait, Maxwell's equations in presence of magnetic charges and currents are often stated as:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ · B = ρ_m

3. ∇ × E = - J_m - ∂B/∂t

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

But units can vary. So expected that equations 2 and 3 would be changed.

Alternatively, Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics book discusses this (Chapter 6). Let's recall. Jackson indeed introduces magnetic charge and current density. The modified Maxwell equations become:

∇ · D = ρ_e

∇ · B = ρ_m

∇ × E = - J_m - ∂B / ∂t

∇ × H = J_e + ∂D / ∂ t

Assuming B = μ₀ H, and D = ε₀ E for free space.

In that scenario, without constitutive relations, Maxwell's equations gain symmetric terms. Therefore, two equations divergences (Gauss laws), and two curl equations include the new sources. 

Therefore, in this case:

In free space:

1. Gauss's Law: ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇ · B = ρ_m (rho_m is the magnetic charge density)

3. Faraday's Law: ∇ × E = - ∂ B / ∂ t - J_m (magnetic current density J_m)

4. Ampère's Law: ∇ × B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂ E / ∂ t + μ₀ J_e

Therefore, original Ampère's Law now would have the displacement current but also the regular current, and Faraday's Law with an extra term for magnetic current.

Thus, in the standard formulation for our universe, Ampère's Law includes the displacement current, but without magnetic terms. By contrast, when establishing "magnetic monopoles" existence, both Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law change. Also, in the presence of J_m? Therefore, which equations actually differ from ours?

Original Summary:

1. ∇ · E = ρ / ε₀.

2. ∇ · B = 0.

3. ∇ × E = - ∂ B / ∂ t.

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂ E / ∂ t.

With monopoles:

1st equation same (maybe).

2nd equation now ∇ · B = ρ_m (or proportional), breaking the zero divergence.

3rd equation, adds a term from the magnetic current.

4th equation not directly has source from monopole currents. Wait: no, Ampère's equation can remain as-is in terms of electric currents and displacement current, unless there's a consideration of magnetic currents interacting as well, but the Ampère's Law is agnostic unless coupled.

Hmm, according to the adjustment made, Ampère's Law retains J_e and the displacement current, while Faraday's Law gets an additional term from J_m.

Thus the only Major changes are made to Equations 2 and 3. Meanwhile, Equations 1 and 4 are unaltered if the E field is due to electric charges and the B field due to magnetic charges and currents.

Wait, but in that case, if Maxwell's equations become symmetric in the presence of magnetic monopoles:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀ (Original)

2. ∇ · B = ρ_m / μ₀ (Modified)

3. ∇ × E = - μ₀ J_m - ∂B/∂t (Modified)

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t  (Original Ampère's Law since it uses J_e)

But actually, No, because Ampère's Law should maintain symmetry. If magnetic currents induce a displacement current similar to electric displacement, but this is getting into more intricate adjustments.

However, generally, Maxwell's equations when incorporating monopoles only require modifying two equations: Gauss's Law for B (from ∇ · B = 0 to ∇ · B = ρ_m ), and a current term in Faraday's Law. Ampère's Law originally had the displacement current added by Maxwell, so possibly that term allows J_e and ∂E/∂t to exist. By symmetry, ∇ × E would need a J_m term when time variation of B exists, just as ∇ × H includes J and displacement.

But definitively: from what's commonly written when extending Maxwell's equations:

The presence of magnetic charge density ρ_m and current J_m modifies two of Maxwell's equations—Gauss's Law for magnetism becomes ∇ · B = ρ_m (or with a constant), and Faraday's Law incorporates the magnetic current density, making ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m (again, considering units). 

Ampère's Circuital Law and Gauss's Law for electricity remain as before. But to check this:

In the original Maxwell's, to get the inconsistency, if you take the divergence of Ampère's Law (∇ · (∇ × B) = 0 = μ₀ ∇ · J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂ (∇ · E)/∂t), leading to the continuity equation: ∇ · J + ∂ρ/∂t = 0.

In a similar fashion, if in Faraday's Law, you take divergence: ∇ · (∇ × E) = 0 = - ∂(∇ · B)/∂t - ∇ · J_m. If ∇ · B = ρ_m, then 0 = - ∂ρ_m/∂t - ∇ · J_m, leading to ∇ · J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t =0, the continuity equation for magnetic charge. So, accordingly, these equations need to be modified.

Therefore:

Gauss's Law for B receives a magnetic charge density term.

Faraday's Law receives a magnetic current density term.

As a result, with the presence of magnetic monopoles, Gauss's Law for magnetism (which previously stated the absence of monopoles) would be modified, and Faraday's Law (which will account for any magnetic current) is adjusted. The other two equations (Gauss's Law for E and Ampère's Law) remain the same. So Faraday's and Gauss's Law are affected. Therefore, original equations 2, and 3 are affected.

But hold on, in the Maxwell's equations set, in our original equations, Ampère's Law was ∇ × B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (the Ampère-Maxwell Law). If you introduce magnetic currents, would it complicate Ampère's Law? According to the previous consideration, maybe not directly, since J in Ampère's Law is the electric current. The Ampère's Law modification paired with displacement current remains. Thus Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law are amended, while the other two stay the same. Therefore in this alternate universe, Maxwell's Equations 2 and 3 are different.

But perhaps H-fields are involved. If we use H and E, etc., but if free space is considered, then it should still hold as before.

Thus, the answer should specifically note that Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m, and Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m. So the second and third equation.

However, depending on the unit conventions, the exact form can differ, but the key point is that Gauss's Law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's Law equation (equation 3) change. In the original equations in SI units, equations (2) ∇ · B = 0 and (3) ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t. In the alternate universe with monopoles, equation 2 gains a magnetic charge density term, and equation 3 contains a magnetic current term. Neither Gauss's Law for electricity nor Ampère's Law requires modification here if only magnetic charges and currents are introduced. However, in natural unit systems, these equations are more symmetric. But within standard Maxwell's framework, where Fara's Law and Ampère's Law are supposed to mirror each other in terms of time derivatives giving rise to the curl of the other field, with monopoles, the symmetry would require further adjustments.

But in step-by-step thinking, in the problem statement, the user might be expecting to recall that without magnetic monopoles, ∇ · B = 0 and ∇ × B's relation, but with monopoles, ∇ · B ≠ 0, and Faraday's gets a term. So most likely, equations 2 (Gauss magnetism) and 3 (Faraday) are changed.

Therefore, answer is: Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law. Hence the equations that change are equation 2 (∇ · B = 4πρ_m) and equation 3 (∇ × E = ... )

Wait, again goes back to units. In Gaussian units, Maxwell's equations have factors of 4π. If the question expects the answer from a Gaussian units perspective, then ∇ · B = 4πρ_m. But often in SI units, the modification is ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m, and Faraday's Law becomes ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m.

But remembering from the differential equations from the original Maxwell's equations as they are written in SI units, in natural units, which equations change.

To sum up:

Original Maxwell's equations (SI units):

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇ · B = 0

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B / ∂t

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E / ∂t

With magnetic monopoles present, Maxwell's equations become modified to:

1. ∇ · E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)

2. ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m (since magnetic charge density now exists)

3. ∇ × E = - ∂B / ∂t - μ₀ J_m (additional term for the magnetic current density J_m)

4. ∇ × B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E / ∂t (unchanged except for possible consideration if you need to include magnetic displacement currents, but usually not, keep Ampère's Law as the existing one with J_e and displacement current).

Therefore, in this setup, equations 2 and 3 would be modified compared to the standard Maxwell's equations, while equations 1 and 4 would remain untouched. Thus, in the alternate universe where magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations specifically differing would be Gauss's Law for Magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3). Ampère's Law doesn't directly involve magnetic monopoles unless currents J_m affect H fields.

Hence, the answered equations that are different would be equations (2) Gauss’s Law for magnetism and (3) Faraday’s Law of Induction.

But to confirm:

Alternatively, in many references, when adding magnetic charges, Maxwell's equations receive modification to two of them: Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇ · B = ρ_m (scaled by constants) and Faraday’s law includes the magnetic current term. Ampère’s law is modified if monopole currents are included.

Wait, but if you have moving magnetic charges, you get J_m. Then in order to have the proper continuity equation (conservation of magnetic charge), then [∇ × E] = - ∂B/∂t - J_m.

In our universe, without magnetic charges, J_m is zero and so ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t.

So Faraday's Law is adjusted here. However, Ampère’s Law is about the generation of B-fields due to currents and time-varying E; unless the motion of magnetic charges affects Ampère's Law—that seems not directly (since B is generated by electric currents and displacement currents in as per Ampère-Maxwell).

But logical checks: Suppose B exists, created maybe both by electric currents and via some relationship with a magnetic charge. If J_e is for electric currents, J_m adds into Faraday's Law. 

Conclusion: Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law are modified.

Hence, the answer should note that Gauss's Law for Magnetism (originally ∇ · B = 0) now has ∇ · B = μ₀ ρ_m, and Faraday's Law (originally ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t) now includes a term related to magnetic current, i.e., ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m. Thus, these two equations would be different from our universe's Maxwell equations.

**Final Answer**
In a universe with isolated magnetic poles, the modified Maxwell equations are Gauss's Law for Magnetism and Faraday's Law. The specific equations that change are:

\boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m \quad \text{and} \quad \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}
