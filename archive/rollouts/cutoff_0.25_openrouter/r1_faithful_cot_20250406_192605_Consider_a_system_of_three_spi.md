The partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) (each taking values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \)) with energy given by \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \) is calculated by summing the Boltzmann factors \( e^{-\beta E} \) over all possible spin configurations. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Possible Spin States**: There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible configurations of the three spins.

2. **Energy Calculation**:
   - **All spins aligned**: \( (+1, +1, +1) \) or \( (-1, -1, -1) \). Each product term \( S_iS_j = 1 \), so the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \). Hence, \( E = -3J \).
   - **Mixed configurations**: All other states (which have two spins of one type and one of the other). The sum of products \( S_iS_j = -1 \), resulting in \( E = J \).

3. **Multiplicity**:
   - **States with energy \( -3J \)**: 2 states (all +1 or all -1).
   - **States with energy \( J \)**: 6 states (each with one spin different from the other two).

4. **Partition Function**:
   - Contributions from each energy level are multiplied by their respective Boltzmann factors:
     \[
     Z = 2 e^{\beta (3J)} + 6 e^{-\beta J}
     \]
   - This accounts for all 8 states.

**Final Answer**:
\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins, each being either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor e^{-\beta E}. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me write them all out and calculate the energy for each, then sum their Boltzmann factors.

First, let's list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1, so:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each of these states, compute the energy E. Let's remember E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Starting with the first state (1): All spins +1.

Compute S1S2 = 1*1 = 1, S1S3 = 1*1 =1, S2S3=1*1=1. So sum is 1+1+1=3. Hence E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: (+1, +1, -1)

S1S2=1*1=1, S1S3=1*(-1)=-1, S2S3=1*(-1)=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, hold on. Substitute into the formula: E = -J*(sum of the terms). So sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, so for state 2 that sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Therefore, E = -J*(-1) = J.

Similarly, state 3: (+1, -1, +1)

Compute each term: S1S2=1*(-1)=-1, S1S3=1*1=1, S2S3=(-1)*1=-1. Sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E = J.

State 4: (+1, -1, -1)

S1S2=1*(-1) =-1, S1S3=1*(-1)= -1, S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E = J.

State 5: (-1, +1, +1)

S1S2=(-1)*1=-1, S1S3=(-1)*1=-1, S2S3=1*1=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E= J.

State 6: (-1, +1, -1)

S1S2=(-1)*1=-1, S1S3=(-1)*(-1)=1, S2S3=1*(-1)=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1=-1. So E=J.

State 7: (-1, -1, +1)

S1S2=(-1)*(-1)=1, S1S3=(-1)*1=-1, S2S3=(-1)*1=-1. Sum:1 -1 -1=-1. So E=J.

State 8: (-1, -1, -1)

All spins are -1. S1S2= (-1)*(-1)=1, S1S3= same=1, S2S3 same=1. Sum=3. So E= -J*(3)= -3J.

Wait a minute, so summarizing:

States 1 and 8 have energy -3J.

States 2,3,4,5,6,7 have energy J. So that total of 8 states. Let me check counts:

Energy -3J: 2 states.

Energy J: 6 states. 2+6=8 yes. Correct.

Therefore, the partition function Z = sum_{states} e^{ -beta E }

So for each energy level, compute e^{-beta E} and multiply by the number of states with that energy.

Therefore:

Z = 2 * e^{-beta (-3J)} + 6 * e^{-beta (J)}. Wait no, be careful. Or wait, E is given, so the exponent is -beta E. But the energy is already in terms of E=..., so for each state, exponent is -beta E.

So for the first case, energy E = -3J. Then exponent is -beta*(-3J) = 3 beta J. Multiply by the number of states with that energy, which is 2.

Similarly, for energy E=J: exponent is -beta*(J) = -beta J. There are 6 states, so 6 * e^{-beta J}.

Therefore Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}.

Wait is that correct?

So each state contributes e^{-beta E}. For the first 2 states (all +1 and all -1) each contributes e^{-beta*(-3J)}=e^{3 beta J}. There's two such states. Then the remaining 6 states have energy J, so each contributes e^{-beta J}, so 6 of them contribute 6 e^{-beta J}. Hence Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}.

But hold on, let me confirm again:

If E = -J [sum of SiSj], then when all spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), the products SiSj will be 1*1 =1 for each pair, so sum is 3, thus energy is -3J. So negative energy. Then in the exponent, it's -beta*E, which would be -beta*(-3J) = 3 beta J. So yes, the Boltzmann factor is e^{3 beta J} for these states.

For the states where two are +1 and one is -1, or two are -1 and one is +1, what is the sum of the products? Let's check an example with two +1 and one -1, like state2: (+1, +1, -1). The products:

S1S2=1*1=1

S1S3=1*(-1)=-1

S2S3=1*(-1)=-1

Total sum=1-1-1= -1. Therefore, energy E=-J*(-1)=J.

Similarly, in a state like (+1, -1, -1):

S1S2= -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3=1. Sum= -1 -1 +1=-1. So E=J.

Therefore, all mixed states (with two spins of one kind and one of the other) have the same energy: E=J.

Hence, exponent is -beta*J, so Boltzmann factor is e^{-beta J}. There are 6 such states (the number of ways to choose the odd spin out: 3 choices for which spin is different, times 2 possible signs for the majority, say, but actual count is 6:

For majority +1: there's (3 choose 1) = 3 states where two are +1 and one is -1, and similarly for majority -1: also 3, so 6 total).

Therefore, indeed, Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}.

Therefore, the partition function should be 2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{-βJ}. Are there any terms with other energies? Wait, let me think if there's a possible state with another energy value, but no. The possible energies are only -3J and J.

But wait, maybe not, because when the number of spins is three, it's possible sometimes. Let me check: is there a state where the sum of SiSj is different?

Suppose, for example, all spins are -1, that gives 3*(-1)*(-1) terms, each equal to 1. So sum 3*1=3, energy -3J. If the spins are two +1 and one -1, we showed sum product terms sum to -1, so energy J.

Alternatively, if spins are different...

Wait, suppose all three spins are different? But with spin variables being only +1 and -1, you can't have three different spins; two will be same and one different. So in all non-uniform states, there are always two spins of one kind and one of the other, so the sum results in -1, leading to E=J.

Therefore, only two energy levels.

Therefore Z is correct.

Alternatively, I can consider factoring techniques or symmetries. But maybe just confirming again.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: Let's compute each term in the sum.

But listing out 8 states and then compute each term.

But since already 2 of the 8 states have energy 3*(-1)*J, and 6 with energy J. Therefore, Z is correct. Therefore, result is Z=2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

But maybe there's a more compact way to write it. Let me see.

Express Z= 2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{-βJ}. Let's factor 2(e^{3βJ} + 3 e^{-βJ}), but not sure if that's better. Maybe. Alternatively, we can rewrite e^{3beta J} as (e^{beta J})^3, then factor out e^{-βJ}, but perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, use hypergeometric functions? No, probably stay as is. So the answer is Z=2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{-βJ}

Wait, but perhaps there's an error. Let me check states 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Wait for state 2: (+1, +1, -1). So sum of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Which is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E=-J * -1 = J. Similarly if we have two +1s and one -1, and all other similar ones.

But now, what if the number of -1s is even? For example, all states with even number of -1s?

Wait, actually, number of -1s is either 0 (all +1), 1, 2,3.

If zero -1s: all +1. Sum is 3, E=-3J.

If three -1s: same as all -1.

If one -1: as in states 2,3,4. Sum calculations already give sum -1 energy, leading to E= J.

Wait, but in the case of three +1's?

Wait no: a state with all three +1s is zero -1s.

Similarly, if with two +1s and one -1: that is three different states.

Similarly,say, two -1 and one +1: three more.

Wait, but let's think about the pairs:

Each term S_iS_j for i,j pairs.

Wait, for three spins, the pair terms are S1S2, S1S3, S2S3.

If we have two variables: Let me think instead of all possible combinations:

Let N be the number of up spins (S=+1), rest S=-1. Then compute the sum Sum_{i<j} S_iS_j.

But I might need to relate N to the sum. Let's consider how products behave.

So total Sum_{i<j} S_iS_j.

If there are three spins, each being +1 or -1.

Let N be the number of spins that are +1. So N can be 0,1,2,3.

Compute the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

If N=0: all S_i=-1. Then each product is +1, sum=3*1=3. Therefore E=-3J.

If N=3: Same as N=0: all +1. Sum=3. Therefore E=-3J.

If N=1: One +1 and two -1. Let the +1 be at S1. Then S1=+1, S2=S3=-1.

Compute S1S2= (-1), S1S3=(-1), S2S3=(+1). Sum=(-1) + (-1) +1= -1. Therefore E=J.

If N=1, all such states would have the same sum. Because regardless of which spin is +1, you get two products of -1 and one of +1, sum= -1.

Similarly, if N=2: Two spins +1 and one -1. Let S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

Then S1S2= +1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum=1 -1 -1= -1. Similarly, for any N=2 state, two +1 and one -1: two products are -1, one +1. So sum=-1. Therefore same energy J.

Therefore, regardless of N being 1 or 2, sum is -1. So energy E=J.

Thus:

Z= [number of states with N=0] * e^{-beta*(-3J)} + [number of states with N=3] * e^{-beta*(-3J)} + [number of states with N=1] * e^{-beta*J} + [number of states with N=2] * e^{-beta*J}

But N=0: 1 state (all -1).

Wait, Wait, hold on! Wait, previously I considered states 1. (+1 +1 +1) and 8. (-1 -1 -1) as with energy -3J. So N=0 would correspond to all -1 (number of +1s is 0, so N=0), which is 1 state. Similarly, N=3 is three +1s, 1 state. But in my initial calculation, states 1 and 8 are N=3 and N=0, each?

Wait, in the state 1: (+1 +1 +1) corresponds to N=3.

State 8: (-1 -1 -1) corresponds to N=0.

However, when determining counts, for the energy -3J, we have two states: N=3 and N=0, each contributes 1.

For N=1 and N=2, which are two different counts of +1s. N=1: the number of +1 spins is 1, N=2: number of -1 spins is 1. The number of states with N=1: C(3,1)=3. Similarly, with N=2: C(3,2)=3. Therefore total 6. So:

Z = (1 +1) e^{3βJ} + (3 +3) e^{-βJ}=2 e^{3beta J} +6 e^{-beta J}. Which gives the same result as before.

Hence that's the same answer as previously.

But here it's better grouped by the number of N=1 and N=2 each contributes 3, so total. So confirms the earlier method.

Alternatively, someone might account for variable N. So, yes, approach is correct.

Hence, the partition function is indeed Z = 2 e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}.

Alternatively, one could write this as 2e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}.

But, Wait, just let me recheck the sum once more.

Spin states:

All up: E= -J*(3) =-3J

All down: same E=-3J? Because regardless if all up or all down, all the products S_iS_j are +1, sum 3.

Hence, the two states (all up, all down) contribute e^{3beta J} each, so 2 e^{3beta J}.

Then for all other states where number of +1s is 1 or 2, you have 6 states. Each of energy J. So that gives 6 e^{-beta J}. So thus, Z=2 e^{3βJ} +6e^{-βJ}

Thus, it's correct.

Wait, for example, in the paramagnetic case, where J is positive, lower energy when spins align. But here, the model is that.

But regardless, formula is correct.

Is there another approach to compute Z more elegantly?

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that there are three pairs and each pair contributes S_i S_j. The energy is on three pair variables. However, in general, partition functions for pairwise interactions can sometimes be factorized or use transformation but for three spins in this configuration it might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, since the system is small, 3 spins, enumeration is actually most straightforward method.

Alternatively, maybe compute Z as the trace of the exponential of the energy, but  this would adjudge again into the same sum. No advantages.

Therefore, considering all states, their energies and multiplicity, the correct formula is 2 e^{3beta J} +6 e^{-beta J}.

Test case: Suppose J=0. Then E=0 for all states, so Z=8 e^{0} =8, yes. Which with J=0, all terms would give e^0=1, and 2*1 +6*1=8. Correct.

Another test case: Temperature high, beta approaching 0. Thenthe exponents vanish: Z≈ 2*(1+3 beta J) +6*(1 - beta J)= 2 +6 + (6 beta J -6 beta J)=8. Makes sense, at high temp, all states equally likely. As beta approaches 0, e^{x} ≈1+x.

But actually if beta=0, Z=8, regardless.

Wait, but statement is when beta approaches zero (high T), Z approaches 8. Which is correct. So when J positive, for some energies: but in high temp, entries are roughly same.

Alternate test case when J positive, and beta J large (low temperature). The system would prefer states with lower energy (since E=-3J is the lowest. So Boltzmann weights for -3J states are e^{3 beta J}. Which would dominate. So Z≈2 e^{3 beta J}. Similarly, when Beta negative? J must have been positive or negative?

Hmm, which depends on physical context, J is usually positive. But anyway.

Therefore, the partition function Z is answer 2 e^{3 beta J} +6 e^{-beta J}

Hence confident. So the answer is Z=2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}

Okay, I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins, each being either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor e^{-\beta E}. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me write them all out and calculate the energy for each, then sum their Boltzmann factors.

First, let's list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1, so:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each of these states, compute the energy E. Let's remember E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Starting with the first state (1): All spins +1.

Compute S1S2 = 1*1 = 1, S1S3 = 1*1 =1, S2S3=1*1=1. So sum is 1+1+1=3. Hence E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: (+1, +1, -1)

S1S2=1*1=1, S1S3=1*(-1)=-1, S2S3=1*(-1)=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, hold on. Substitute into the formula: E = -J*(sum of the terms). So sum is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3, so for state 2 that sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Therefore, E = -J*(-1) = J.

Similarly, state 3: (+1, -1, +1)

Compute each term: S1S2=1*(-1)=-1, S1S3=1*1=1, S2S3=(-1)*1=-1. Sum = -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E = J.

State 4: (+1, -1, -1)

S1S2=1*(-1) =-1, S1S3=1*(-1)= -1, S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E = J.

State 5: (-1, +1, +1)

S1S2=(-1)*1=-1, S1S3=(-1)*1=-1, S2S3=1*1=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E= J.

State 6: (-1, +1, -1)

S1S2=(-1)*1=-1, S1S3=(-1)*(-1)=1, S2S3=1*(-1)=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1=-1. So E=J.

State 7: (-1, -1, +1)

S1S2=(-1)*(-1)=1, S1S3=(-1)*1=-1, S2S3=(-1)*1=-1. Sum:1 -1 -1=-1. So E=J.

State 8: (-1, -1, -1)

All spins are -1. S1S2= (-1)*(-1)=1, S1S3= same=1, S2S3 same=1. Sum=3. So E= -J*(3)= -3J.

Wait a minute, so summarizing:

States 1 and 8 have energy -3J.

States 2,3,4,5,6,7 have energy J. So that total of 8 states. Let me check counts:

Energy -3J: 2 states.

Energy J: 6 states. 2+6=8 yes. Correct.

Therefore, the partition function Z = sum_{states} e^{ -beta E }

So for each energy level, compute e^{-beta E} and multiply by the number of states with that energy.

Therefore:

Z = 2 * e^{-beta (-3J)} + 6 * e^{-beta (J)}. Wait no, be careful. Or wait, E is given, so the exponent is -beta E. But the energy is already in terms of E=..., so for each state, exponent is -beta E.

So for the first case, energy E = -3J. Then exponent is -beta*(-3J) = 3 beta J. Multiply by the number of states with that energy, which is 2.

Similarly, for energy E=J: exponent is -beta*(J) = -beta J. There are 6 states, so 6 * e^{-beta J}.

Therefore Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}.

Wait is that correct?

So each state contributes e^{-beta E}. For the first 2 states (all +1 and all -1) each contributes e^{-beta*(-3J)}=e^{3 beta J}. There's two such states. Then the remaining 6 states have energy J, so each contributes e^{-beta J}, so 6 of them contribute 6 e^{-beta J}. Hence Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}.

# Anthropic completion

To calculate the partition function Z for a system of three spins, with each spin being either +1 or -1, and the energy given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ], we must consider all possible configurations of the spins and sum the Boltzmann factors e^{-βE} for each state. As there are three spins, and each can be either +1 or -1, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. Let's enumerate these states and determine the energy associated with each one.

The eight possible combinations of S1, S2, and S3 are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

For each state, we need to calculate the energy E using the formula E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Starting with state 1, where all spins are +1, we find that S1S2 = 1*1 = 1, S1S3 = 1*1 = 1, and S2S3 = 1*1 = 1. The sum of these terms is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, so the energy for this state is E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Moving on to state 2, where S1 = +1, S2 = +1, and S3 = -1, we have S1S2 = 1*1 = 1, S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1, and S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1. The sum of these terms is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1, and thus the energy for this state is E = -J*(-1) = J.

Continuing this process for the remaining states:

State 3: S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1
S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1, S1S3 = 1*1 = 1, S2S3 = (-1)*1 = -1. Sum = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1, so E = J.

State 4: S1 = +1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1
S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1, S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1, S2S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1. Sum = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1, so E = J.

State 5: S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = +1
S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1, S1S3 = (-1)*1 = -1, S2S3 = 1*1 = 1. Sum = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1, so E = J.

State 6: S1 = -1, S2 = +1, S3 = -1
S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1, S1S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1, S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1. Sum = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1, so E = J.

State 7: S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = +1
S1S2 = (-1)*(-1) = 1, S1S3 = (-1)*1 = -1, S2S3 = (-1)*1 = -1. Sum = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1, so E = J.

State 8: S1 = -1, S2 = -1, S3 = -1
S1S2 = (-1)*(-1) = 1, S1S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1, S2S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1. Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, so E = -J*(3) = -3J.

In summary, states 1 and 8 have an energy of -3J, while states 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 have an energy of J. There are 2 states with energy -3J and 6 states with energy J, for a total of 8 states.

The partition function Z is the sum over all states of the Boltzmann factor e^{-βE}. For each energy level, we compute e^{-βE} and multiply it by the number of states with that energy.

For states 1 and 8 with energy E = -3J, the exponent is -β*(-3J) = 3βJ. There are 2 states with this energy, so their contribution to Z is 2 * e^{3βJ}.

For states 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 with energy E = J, the exponent is -β*(J) = -βJ. There are 6 states with this energy, so their contribution to Z is 6 * e^{-βJ}.

Therefore, the partition function for this system is Z = 2 * e^{3βJ} + 6 * e^{-βJ}.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to find the partition function Z for a system of three spins, each having values of either +1 or -1. The energy is described by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. The partition function Z is calculated as the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor e^{-\beta E}. Given that each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me enumerate them, compute the energy for each state, and then sum their Boltzmann factors.

First, let's list all combinations of S1, S2, S3, where each can be +1 or -1:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

For each of these states, let's calculate the energy E, using E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

For the first state (1), where all spins are +1, 
S1S2 = 1*1 = 1, S1S3 = 1*1 = 1, S2S3 = 1*1 = 1. So, the sum is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Hence, E = -J*(3) = -3J.

For the second state (+1, +1, -1),
S1S2 = 1*1 = 1, S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1, S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1. The sum is 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Similarly, for the third state (+1, -1, +1),
S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1, S1S3 = 1*1 = 1, S2S3 = (-1)*1 = -1. The sum is -1 + 1 - 1 = -1. So E = J.

For the fourth state (+1, -1, -1),
S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1, S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1, S2S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1. The sum is -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. So E = J.

For the fifth state (-1, +1, +1),
S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1, S1S3 = (-1)*1 = -1, S2S3 = 1*1 = 1. The sum is -1 - 1 + 1 = -1. So E = J.

For the sixth state (-1, +1, -1),
S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1, S1S3 = (-1)*(-1) = 1, S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1. The sum is -1 + 1 - 1 = -1. So E = J.

For the seventh state (-1, -1, +1),
S1S2 = (-1)*(-1) = 1, S1S3 = (-1)*1 = -1, S2S3 = (-1)*1 = -1. The sum is 1 - 1 - 1 = -1. So E = J.

For the eighth state (-1, -1, -1), where all spins are -1,
S1S2 = (-1)*(-1) = 1, S1S3 = 1, S2S3 = 1. The sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

To summarize:

States 1 and 8 have energy -3J. 

States 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 have energy J. 

Therefore, the partition function Z, a sum over all states e^{ -beta E }, is calculated as follows:

For energy -3J: the exponent is -beta*(-3J) = 3 beta J. There are 2 states contributing to this, so we get 2 * e^{3βJ}. 

For energy J: the exponent is -beta J. There are 6 contributing states, so 6 * e^{-βJ}.

Thus, Z = 2 * e^{3βJ} + 6 * e^{-βJ}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, \) and \( S_3 \) each taking values \( \pm 1 \), with energy given by \( E = -J(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3) \), we need to consider all possible states and their corresponding energies.

First, we enumerate all 8 possible states of the system and calculate their energies:
- States with all spins aligned (\(+1, +1, +1\) and \(-1, -1, -1\)) have energy \( E = -3J \).
- States with two spins aligned and one misaligned (there are 6 such states) have energy \( E = J \).

The partition function \( Z \) is then computed by summing the Boltzmann factors for each state:
- For the two states with energy \(-3J\), each contributes \( e^{3\beta J} \).
- For the six states with energy \( J \), each contributes \( e^{-\beta J} \).

Thus, the partition function \( Z \) is:
\[
Z = 2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}
\]

\[
\boxed{2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

That seems okay. Let me confirm with specific examples.

Alternatively, maybe proceed via variables. Let me think if I can find the partition function in a smarter way, maybe by symmetry.

Since all the spins are equivalent, perhaps we can group terms by the number of up and down spins.

If it's 3-up: 1 state (all +1), 3-down: 1 state (all -1), but actually states 1 and 8. Then states with two up and one down: there are  C(3,1)=3 states:like ( +1, +1, -1). Similar for two down and one up: C(3,1)=3. So 6 states total. But according to our earlier calculation, regardless of being two up one down or two down one up, the energy is the same. Let's see:

Take a state with two up and one down. Let me calculate energy. Say (+1, +1, -1). As in state 2, energy J. Similarly, if it's two down and one up, e.g., (+1, -1, -1) is state 4, which also has energy J. Similarly for others. So it turns out whether it's two up one down or two down one up, same energy. So all these states have S1S2 + S2S3 + S3S1 = -1, leading to E=J.

The case with all up or all down has sum +3, leading to E=-3J. So you can parameterize in terms of the number of up spins, but you have symmetry in two up and one down same as two down and one up in terms of energy.

Therefore, the first thinking seems correct. Hence Z = 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{-β J}

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting E. Let me check again.

Original energy: E = -J(S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). So when all spins are +1, S1 S2 = 1, etc, sum terms 3 => E = -3J. In the two-up one-down case, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Suppose two up and one down, (+, +, -). Then S1 S2 = 1, S1 S3= -1, S2 S3 = -1, sum 1 -1 -1 = -1. Thus E= -J*(-1)= J. Similarly, if two down and one up, like (+, -, -), S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2 S3=1, total sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1, so same thing.

So whatever, whenever not all spins align, you get this.

So total: either you have energy -3J (all aligned) or J (not all aligned).

So yes, that splits the 8 states into 2 with -3J and 6 with J.

This computation is correct, so the partition function is Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-β J}

Wait, alternate approach: product over the possible interactions? Hmm, no, this seems simple enough.

Alternatively, if I use variables: Let K = β J. Then Z = 2 e^{3 K} + 6 e^{-K}. Alternatively, factor:

But probably stay as it is.

Yes, seems correct. Alternatively, let me check with a second method. Let's compute Z = sum_{S1,S2,S3} exp( β J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3) )

Note that each of the variables is S_i = ±1. Let me consider transforming variables, or perhaps note that S1 S2, etc are also ±1.

Wait, we have three terms: each term S_i S_j is 1 if they are the same, -1 otherwise.

Alternatively, if all three spins are the same, all three terms are +1, so energy E = -3J. In other cases (if two same, one different), sum of terms is (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1; so energy J. Therefore same as before.

It's the same as calculating how many terms we have where all spins are the same (2) and the rest (6), leading to the same result.

Alternatively, think in terms of variables. Let me maybe express S1, S2, S3 in terms of variables and transform the expression.

But maybe there's another way. Let's factor S1 from some parts:

The energy terms are spin products. So E= -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Maybe consider that as E = -J [ S1(S2 + S3) + S2 S3 ]

But maybe that's not helpful. Let me see.

Alternatively, the pairs.

Alternatively, let me note that the Hamiltonian can be written in terms of a combination of products and see if there's some symmetry. But probably messy. Alternatively, change variables. Let me suppose variables t1 = S1 S2, t2 = S1 S3, t3 = S2 S3. But since ti are related (t1 t2 = S1^2 S2 S3 = S2 S3 = t3 if S1^2=1). So maybe that complicates.

Alternatively another approach: observe that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2))/2. But S1, S2, S3 are ±1, so S_i^2 =1. Therefore, (∑ S_i)^2 = 3 + 2 (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (∑ S_i)^2 -3 ] / 2.

Therefore, the Hamiltonian is E = -J [ ( (∑ S_i)^2 -3 ) / 2 ] = ( -J/2 ) ( (∑ S_i)^2 - 3 ) ) = (-J/2)(M^2 -3) where M is the magnetization, sum S_i.

Thus, E = - ( J / 2 ) M^2 + (3 J)/2

But energies can be shifted by a constant; however, the partition function involves exponential of beta*(-E). Wait actually:

Wait, if the energy is transformed as H = -J sum <i,j> S_i S_j, then is this equivalent to the expression above. Wait, but we can write H in terms of M. So per the above,

sum_{i<j} S_i S_j = (M^2 - 3)/2

Therefore, H = -J * (M^2 - 3)/2

Thus, internal energy is H = -J(M^2 -3)/2. Hence,

E = - (J/2) M^2 + (3J/2)

Thus, the energy levels can also be characterized by M = sum S_i. So if we can parametrize the states by total magnetization M.

Possible M values? Since each S_i=±1 and there are three spins, so sum can be -3, -1, +1, +3.

Indeed:

If all three are +1: M=3.

Two +1, one -1: M=1.

One +1, two -1: M=-1.

All three -1: M=-3.

So magnetization can take values M=-3,-1,1,3. Counts for each:

M=3:1 state (all up)
M=1:C(3,2)=3 states (two up, one down)
M=-1:C(3,2)=3 states (two down, one up)
M=-3:1 state (all down)

Thus multiplicity (number of states) for each M:

M=3:1

M=1:3

M=-1:3

M=-3:1

But in this case, energies depend on M. Wait, E as a function of M is:

E(M) = -(J/2)(M^2 - 3) = (-J/2)M^2 + (3J)/2

Therefore, substitute M^2:

For M= ±3: M^2=9, so E= -(J/2)(9 -3) = -(J/2)(6)= -3J, which matches the prior calculation.

M=±1: M^2=1, so E= -(J/2)(1 - 3)= - (J/2)(-2) = J, also as before. So indeed, each magnetization corresponds to an energy.

But since the energies only depend on M^2, so same for M and -M.

Therefore,-3 vs +3 both have the same modulus, same energy. So total, M=3 and M=-3 each have 1 state, and contribute energy -3J, in total 2 states. M=1 and M=-1 each have 3 states, contributing energy J, in total 6 states. So the same as before.

Thus, the partition function is sum_{M} (number of states with M) * e^{-beta E(M)}.

So M=-3, E=-3J: contribution 1* e^{-beta*(-3J)}= e^{3 beta J}

M=-1, E= J : 3* e^{-beta J}

M=1, E=J: 3*e^{-beta J}

M=3, E=-3J: 1* e^{3 beta J}

Therefore Z= (1+1) e^{3 beta J} + (3 +3) e^{-beta J} = 2 e^{3 beta J} + 6 e^{-beta J}, which is the same result as before. So this method matches the first. So therefore, Z=2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{-βJ}

Probably the correct answer. Alternatively, to be thorough, compute each Boltzmann factor for all 8 states.

List all 8 states, compute partition function.

Already did energies, just check once again.

1. S1,S2,S3=1,1,1: E=-3J, contributing e^{3βJ}
2.1,1,-1: J,e^{-beta J}

3.1,-1,1: J,e^{-beta J}

4.1,-1,-1: J, e^{-beta J}

5.-1,1,1: J, e^{-beta J}

6.-1,1,-1: J, e^{-beta J}

7.-1,-1,1: J, e^{-beta J}

8.-1,-1,-1: -3J, e^{3βJ}

Total sum: e^{3βJ} + e^{-beta J}*6 + e^{3βJ}= 2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{-beta J}, same as before. So definitely, this must be the correct answer. Therefore, conclude Z=2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{-βJ}.

Just wanted to check in two different ways, but both give the same result. So confident.

**Final Answer**
The partition function is \boxed{2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) with energy \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \) is calculated by summing the Boltzmann factors for all possible spin configurations. Each spin can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), leading to \( 2^3 = 8 \) states.

**Energy Calculations:**

Simplifying this expression, we can factor out 2 * e^{-βJ} to get Z = 2 * e^{-βJ} (e^{4βJ} + 3). However, this step isn't necessary unless required for further simplification. The answer can be presented as Z = 2e^{3βJ} + 6e^{-βJ}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To find the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1 \), \( S_2 \), and \( S_3 \) where each spin can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \), we follow these steps:

1. **Enumerate all possible states**: There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) states for the three spins.
2. **Calculate the energy for each state**:
   - When all spins are aligned (either all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)), the energy is \( -3J \).
   - When two spins are \( +1 \) and one is \( -1 \), or vice versa, the energy is \( J \).

3. **Determine the Boltzmann factors**:
   - For states with energy \( -3J \): There are 2 such states, each contributing \( e^{3\beta J} \).
   - For states with energy \( J \): There are 6 such states, each contributing \( e^{-\beta J} \).

4. **Sum the Boltzmann factors**:
   - The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of these contributions:
     \[
     Z = 2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}
     \]

5. **Verification using alternate methods**:
   - Using the identity for the sum of spins and hyperbolic functions confirms the same result.

Thus, the partition function \( Z \) is:

\[
\boxed{Z = 2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}}
\]

---

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

That's the expression for the partition function.

Wait, wait. Let me verify again the calculation. For each state with energy E, the Boltzmann factor is e^{-βE}, right?

When the energy E = -3J, so we have e^{-β(-3J)} = e^{3βJ}. Correct. For each of the two states with this energy, so 2 * e^{3βJ}.

For the other 6 states, which have E = J. So, e^{-β * J} for each, and multiplied by 6. So yes, 6 e^{-βJ}.

Alternatively, maybe I could consider symmetries or alternate approaches. Let's see. Each of the three terms in energy: S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. The sum of these terms. Maybe express it in terms of variables. Alternatively, note that:

The sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten as 

Let me note that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2)) / 2. Since (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Therefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ] / 2. Since each S_i is either +1 or -1, S_i^2 = 1. Thus, S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3. Therefore,

Sum = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2.

So, E = -J * [ (S_sum^2 - 3)/2 ] where S_sum = S1 + S2 + S3. So that E = - (J/2) S_sum^2 + (3J/2). Therefore, maybe an alternate way.

Since we can parametrize the energy in terms of S_sum.

Now possible values of S_sum:

Each spin ±1 divided into four groups.

S_sum can be 3*1 = 3, 1*1 + 2*(-1) = -1, which becomes S_sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Wait: possible sums:

Each spin is ±1. The possible sum S1 + S2 + S3 can be?

Starting with all up: 3. Then you can have two up, one down: 1. Then one up, two down: -1. All down: -3.

Indeed:

When all three spins are +1: sum is +3.

When two spins are +1, one is -1: sum is +1.

When one spin is +1, two are -1: sum is -1.

When all spins are -1: sum is -3.

How many states correspond to each sum?

- Sum +3: 1 state (all +1)

- Sum +1: combination of 2 up and 1 down. Number of states: 3 choose 1 = 3 (select which spin is down). Wait, but in the earlier enumeration, I found that there are 6 states with energy J. Wait a minute, perhaps there is an inconsistency here. Wait. Wait, according to the energy calculated earlier, the partition counts were 2 states for -3J and 6 states for J.

Wait, but according to the analysis in terms of S_sum:

- Sum = +3 corresponds to E = -3J. So 1 state.

- Sum = -3 corresponds to E = -3J as well? Wait, when S_sum is -3, then (S_sum)^2 = 9, so E = - (J/2) *9 + (3J/2) = (-9J/2 + 3J/2) = (-6J)/2 = -3J. So likewise, sum = -3 also gives E = -3J. Therefore, how many states have sum = +3? One, all up. Sum = -3? One, all down. So two states with sum^2 = 9, i.e., E = -3J, which matches previous result. Then sum = 1 or sum = -1.

Sum = +1 and sum = -1. When sum is +1: number of states is 3 choose 1 = 3 (as we have three spins, choosing one to be -1 and others +1), but actually in 3 spins, sum will be +1 if two are up and one is down (since 1+1-1=1). Similarly, sum = -1 is similarly achieved by two down and one up. So sum = -1 has 3 states. Wait, same as sum = +1. So the total number of states with sum = +1 is 3, sum = -1 also 3; along with the sum +3 and -3 (each 1), total 8. So 3 +3 +1+1=8. Then why in the previous enumeration of states, found 6 states with energy J. That suggests that when sum is +1 and -1, maybe their energy is the same. Let's check using S_sum. 

Suppose a state has sum = +1. Then using E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3] and moving from the previous expression: E = - (J/2)(S_sum^2 - 3). Therefore, when sum = +1, E = - (J/2)(1 - 3) = - (J/2)(-2) = J. Similarly, when sum = -1, squaring gives 1 so same calculation. Hence, sum = ±1 leads to E = J. Which I had in the earlier calculation. Sum = 3 and -3 gives E = -3J. So both analytical methods confirm that.

Therefore, the two methods of calculation corroborate. From the sum variables we can conclude that:

- 2 states (sum = +3 and sum = -3) have E = -3J.

- Int the calculation enumerated, this corresponds to states 1 and 8. Hence, 2 states.

And 3 +3=6 states with sum = +1 and -1, with E = J. This corresponds to states 2,3,4,5,6,7. Hence, 6 states.

Therefore, yes, the partition function is Z = 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.

Thus, this must be the answer. The key thing here is that energies group states into two distinct values: -3J and J. So no matter the approach (direct enumeration or using the sum of spins and energies), we get the same partition function, which solidifies my confidence.

Alternatively, maybe through another approach. Let us attempt to factor the partition function in terms of variables.

Another method: For each spin, calculate all combinations, but perhaps using variable substitution. However, the partition function sum is straightforward over 8 terms. But if the number of spins were much larger, such an approach might not be feasible. However, since it's only three, enumeration is viable.

Alternatively, note that for three spins, the term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Alternatively, I can think of the Hamiltonian as having interactions between each pair. For three spins, we have three pairwise interactions. Each term is S_iS_j. Each pair contributes.

The partition function is thus summing exp(β J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)).

Wait, no:

Wait the energy E is equal to -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So the Boltzmann factor is e^{-beta E} = e^{beta J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)}.

Hence, the partition function is the product over all pairs? Not exactly, because each spin exists in multiple pairs, making interactions dependent.

But perhaps using a high-temperature expansion or some formula.

Alternatively, another approach is to notice that the Hamiltonian is symmetric under permutation of the spins. Hence, the states can be grouped by their total magnetization, which perhaps equates to assembling the possible S_sum values. Which is exactly what we did before.

But since the energies can depend on higher combinations than just the total sum—or originally and as seen through S_sum, that it's proportional to (S_sum)^2. Thus, the energies are grouped according to this.

But regardless, given the small system size, direct calculation is feasible here. So back to the partition function being Z = 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{-beta J}.

Let me check my prior thought step again: Indeed, in terms of S_sum^2:

Each state's energy is E = - (J/2) S_sum^2 + (3J)/2. 

Because E = -J[ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]=and since S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3 )^2 - (S1² + S2² + S3²) ] / 2. So S1² are all 1, so subtract 3, giving:

(S_sum^2 - 3)/2. Thus, E = -J*( (S_sum^2 -3)/2 )= - (J/2) S_sum^2 + 3J/2.

So then the Boltzmann factor for E is e^{- beta E} = e^{ (beta J/2) S_sum^2 - 3 beta J /2 }.

However, when grouped in terms of S_sum^2 values.

Possible S_sum^2 values are 9, 1, corresponding to S_sum being +/-3 or +/-1. Wait, +/-1 and +/-3. S_sum^2 can be 9 or 1 (since (+-1)^2=1, (+-3)^2=9). Moreover, for each S_sum^2=9, the energy term contributes.

So perhaps grouping parts:

Z = sum_{states} e^{ (beta J /2 ) S_sum^2 - 3 beta J /2 }.

Alternatively: e^{- 3 beta J /2} * sum_{states} e^{ (beta J /2 ) S_sum^2 }.

But isn't that equivalent to Z = e^{- (3 beta J)/2 } [ 2 e^{(9 beta J)/2 } + 6 e^{ beta J /2 } ]

Which factors e^{-3βJ/2 } * [2 e^{9βJ/2} + 6 e^{βJ/2 }] = 2 e^{ (9βJ/2 - 3βJ/2) } + 6 e^{ (βJ/2 - 3βJ/2) } ) = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-beta J }, which is the same as before.

So confirming that both approaches give the same Z, which is good. 

Alternatively, especially since the system is small, this method works. For larger systems? Probably not, but here is manageable.

So the key point is that there are 2 states with (S1, S2, S3) aligned all +1 or all -1 (yielding S_sum^2=9) and 6 states where two are one way and the third is opposite (sum squared=1). 

Therefore, Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{ -beta J }.

Wait, wait. Hold on, from previous calculations using Ssum^2:

E = -3J corresponds to sum squared=9. Then, The exponential factor for S_sum^2=9 is e^{(beta J /2) * 9 } so e^{ 9 beta J /2 }, but multiplied by e^{- 3 beta J/2 } on the outside, leading to e^{(9 beta J /2 - 3 beta J /2)} = e^{ 6 beta J /2 } = e^{ 3 beta J }

Similarly, for sum_sq=1, the exponential term from Z expression would be e^{( beta J /2 *1 )} multiplied by e^{- 3 beta J /2 }, giving e^{( beta J /2 - 3 beta J /2 } = e^{-beta J }, same as before.

So yes, yeah, so exp(-3 beta J/2 ) [ 2*exp(9 beta J /2 ) + 6 exp( beta J /2 ) ] = same. Hence, the same result.

Therefore, I think this is correct. 

I think that the answer is:

Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-βJ}.

It can also be written as factorized form (if possible). Let's check.

Alternatively check with another approach. For partition functions of individual interactions? Though since the system is small and interactions are between each pair, standard steps might not directly apply. Let's see:

But maybe using the method that for interacting spins, partition functions can sometimes be rewritten as products over the interaction terms.

Consider that the Hamiltonian is H = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ). Perhaps can the partition function be written multiplicatively?

Alternatively, note that each spin pair contributes a term. However, when considered for multiple pairs, spins are related. It's not e.g. a one-dimensional chain where interactions are multiplicative as each term is a distinct pair. Here, three pairs all overlapping.

Alternatively, the standard formula for a fully-connected three-spin system, perhaps as a star or triangle, but in this case, each pair.

Let me attempt to compute partition function as follow.

Define variables: for each spin S1, S2, S3 in ±1. Then sum over all possible S1, S2, S3.

Z = sum_{S1, S2, S3} exp[ β J ( S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ) ]

Because E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3], so the Boltzmann factor would be positive exponent. 

Alternatively, perhaps formula of the product. Here goes:

Note that for high-temperature expansion or low-temperature expansion. However, perhaps we can rewrite:

Let us realize that:

exp[ β J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) ] = exp(β J S1S2) * exp(β J S1S3) * exp(β J S2S3 )

But this approach complicates as these exponentials do not split variables.

Alternatively, perhaps apply the identity for Ising model that e^{K S_i S_j} can be written using hyperbolic terms. Recall that for a single pair S and S', e^{ K S S' } = cosh(K) + S S' sinh(K).

However, since here we have three such terms, possibly coupled. Multiplying three terms (for each pair):

However, maybe using the identity might lead to cross terms. But since the interactions are all between the three spins.

Alternatively, suppose for each spin pair, expand S1S2 terms.

But below is the approach.

Let me consider each term:

For pairs (S1, S2), (S1, S3), (S2, S3), each term e^{β J S_i S_j} is equal to cosh(β J) + S_i S_j sinh(β J). Therefore, here's what the partition function becomes:

Z = sum_{S1, S2, S3} [ e^{β J S1S2} * e^{β J S1S3} * e^{β J S2S3 } ] 
= sum_{S1, S2, S3} [ (cosh(β J) + S1S2 sinh(β J)) * (cosh(β J) + S1S3 sinh(β J)) * (cosh(β J) + S2S3 sinh(β J)) ]

But expanding that might not be so simple because we multiply three terms each of the form cosh(K) + something sinh(K). The product would generate terms like cosh^3(K), cosh^2(K) sinh(K) (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3), etc.

But possibly, integrating over the spins (i.e. summing over S1, S2, S3 values of ±1) would eliminate some terms due to spin flips.

Alternatively, knowing that summing over S1, S2, S3 possibly cancels many cross terms.

Alternatively, proceed step by step.

Expand the triple product:

First, expand each of the three factors:

First terms from each bracket:

First term: cosh(β J) * cosh(β J) * cosh(β J) = cosh^3(β J).

Then terms where we pick one sinh and two cosh terms. The sum over all possible single sinh terms multiply by sinh(β J) * cosh^2(β J) times the following products of S_n S_m:

terms with (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

But when sum over S1, S2, S3, the terms linear in S_i S_j will vanish. Because, for example, Sum over S1, S2, S3 S1S2. When S1 and S2 are ±1, summing over S1 and S2: S1S2 can be +1 or -1 with equal probability when S3 is summed out. Because S3 is separate. Wait, let's for each case.

For example, Sum_{S1,S2,S3} S1S2 = Sum_{S1,S2} S1S2 * Sum_{S3} 1. Since Sum_{S3}1 = 2, then Sum_{S1,S2} S1S2 *2. Now, in Sum_{S1, S2}, each possible combination of S1 and S2. Let's see:

Possible S1 and S2: (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1 -1). Their products:1, -1, -1,1. Thus sum over S1S2 = 1 -1 -1 +1 =0. Thus total Sum_{S1,S2,S3} S1S2=0. Similarly Sum_{S1,S2,S3} S1S3=0, and Sum_{S2,S3} S2S3 would be zero. Thus terms with single S_i S_j terms will vanish when summed.

Next, in the product, the cross terms when taking two sinh terms and one cosh term. For each pair of sinh terms, so (S1S2 sinh (K)) * (S2S3 sinh(K)) and so on. For each choice of two (exponent) terms, which gives S1S3*S2S3 = S1 S2 (as S3 squared=1). Then product terms S1S2 * S1S3 = S2 S3.

But perhaps getting complicated, but.

Let’s note that cross terms when two sinh terms are involved:

Each cross term is sinh^2(K) cosh(K) * various spin products. Let's think.

Maybe let me actually proceed to expand the product. But this might take a while.

Another tactic: expanding the original three exponentials is going to generate cosh^3 terms, sinh cosh squared terms with sum of pairs, sinh squared cosh terms with products of pairs, and sinh cubed terms with products of all three.

But given that the overall trace (sum over all states) would truncate some of the terms because of cancellations. Let's attempt this.

Let me write factors as A = cosh(K) and B = sinh(K) where K = βJ, for simplification.

The product becomes:

(A + B S1 S2)(A + B S1 S3)(A + B S2 S3).

Multiply the first two factors:

(A + B S1 S2)(A + B S1 S3) = A² + A B S1 S3 + A B S1 S2 + B² S1² S2 S3.

Since S1² =1, that last term becomes B² S2 S3.

So expanding, the product of the first two factors gives:

A² + A B S1(S3 + S2) + B² S2 S3.

Now multiply by the third factor (A + B S2 S3):

Multiply term by term:

First term: A²(A + B S2 S3) = A³ + A² B S2 S3.

Second term: A B S1(S3 + S2) * (A + B S2 S3) =

A*[A B S1(S3 + S2)] B S2 S3]: no, more precisely:

Break it down:

The term A B S1(S3 + S2) multiplied by A gives A² B S1(S3 + S2).

And multiplied by B S2 S3:

A B S1(S3 + S2) * B S2 S3 = A B² S1 ( (S3 + S2) S2 S3 ).

Similarly, compute (S3 + S2) S2 S3. Let me see:

= S3 * S2 S3 + S2 * S2 S3

= S2 (S3)^2 + (S2)^2 S3

Since S_i^2=1, this simplifies to S2 (1) + 1 * S3 = S2 + S3.

Therefore, this term becomes A B² S1 (S2 + S3).

Third term: B² S2 S3 multiplied by A + B S2 S3:

A*B² S2 S3 + B^3 (S2 S3)^2.

But (S2 S3)^2 =1. So B^3 term. 

So compiling the full extent:

Following in expanding the three multiplications step-by-step:

1. First term (A²): results in A³ + A² B S2 S3.

2. Second term (A B S1(S3 + S2)): when multiplied by (A + B S2 S3) yields two terms:

   i. A² B S1(S3 + S2).

   ii. A B² S1(S3 + S2) S2 S3 = A B² S1 (S2 + S3) S2 S3. Which as above becomes A B² S1(S2 + S3).

But wait, above correction: Wait, nope, in previous part, we found that (S3 + S2) S2 S3 becomes S2 + S3. Wait, detailed steps:

(S3 + S2) S2 S3 =

First term: S3*S2*S3 = S2*(S3)^2 = S2*1 = S2.

Second term: S2 * S2*S3 = (S2)^2 * S3 = 1 * S3 = S3.

Hence, altogether, S2 + S3.

Thus, step ii's S1 * (S2 + S3) comes.

Thus, the second two terms: A B² S1(S2 + S3).

Third term: B² S2 S3 times (A + B S2 S3) gives A B² S2 S3 + B^3 (S2 S3)^2 = A B² S2 S3 + B^3, since as above (S2 S3)^2 =1.

Now combining all terms across.

Therefore, the total product is the sum of:

A³ [from term 1]

+ A² B S2 S3 [term 1]

+ A² B S1(S3 + S2) [term 2i]

+ A B² S1(S2 + S3) [term 2ii]

+ A B² S2 S3 [term3i]

+ B³ [term3ii]

Now, collect like terms:

- Terms without any spins:

A³ + B³.

- Terms with S2 S3:

A² B S2 S3 + A B² S2 S3.

- Terms with S1 S2: 

In term2i: A² B S1 S2

and term2ii: A B² S1 S2

similarly term2i: also has S1 S3.

Wait, term2i is A² B S1 (S3 + S2) which includes S1 S3 and S1 S2.

Similarly, term2ii is A B² S1(S2 + S3), which includes A B² S1 S2 + A B² S1 S3.
 
Need to parse all spin terms:

Let me detail:

Terms involving S1 S2:

- From term2i: A² B S1 S2,

- From term2ii: A B² S1 S2,

Total coefficient for S1 S2: A² B + A B² = A B (A + B).

Similarly, for S1 S3:

- From term2i: A² B S1 S3,

- From term2ii: A B² S1 S3.

Similarly, coefficient A B (A + B).

Then, the terms with S2 S3:

From term1: A² B S2 S3,

from term3i: A B² S2 S3,

and there's also from a component of term2ii:

Wait, no. Were there cross terms S2 S3 stemming from term2ii?

No, term3 is split between term "term3i" and "term3ii". So term3i leads to A B² S2 S3.

So therefore, coefficients for S2 S3:

A^2 B + A B^2 = A B (A + B).

But, in addition, the term2i possibly?

No, term2i has only a combo of S1 S2 and S1 S3, so in these accounts we have:

So S is.

Different structure.

Wait, in field of the expression, collect all terms:

Full expansion:

A^3 + B^3 + [ A² B + A B² ] S2 S3 + [A² B S1 S3 + A² B S1 S2 ] + A B² S1(S2 + S3) + term3i: A B² S2 S3.

But perhaps confused by previous summation.

Alternatively, perhaps compute each term step-by-step. For instance:

After expansion, all individual spin terms:

1. A³ : scalars.

2. B³: scalars.

3. Terms involving only S2S3:

From term1: which gives A² B S2 S3,

From term3i: A B² S2 S3.

Totalling for S2S3 coefficient: A² B + A B² = A B (A + B).

4. Terms involving S1S3：

Originally coming from term2i expanding part (A² B S1 S3), and term2ii's component A B² S1 S3.

So combining sums to A² B S1 S3 + A B² S1 S3 = A B (A + B) S1 S3.

5. Similarly terms involving S1 S2:

Similarly, from term2i expanding part：A^2 B S1 S2, term2ii's component: A B^2 S1 S2。Therefore sum is A B (A + B) S1 S2。

6. Lastly，Term3ii gave B³.

So now grouping everything, the entire partition function when summed over S1, S2, S3 is:

Z = sum_{S1,S2,S3} [ product ]

Similarly, after expansion:

= sum_{S1,S2,S3} [ A³ + B³ + A B (A + B) (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 ) ]

Because the coefficients for S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 were each A B (A + B ), so combining their quantities:

Thus, turns out to be A³ + B³ + A B (A + B )( S1S2 + S1S3 + S2 S3 ) 。

Now, sum over all states.

But summing over S1, S2, S3:

Since sum S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3 over all states is important.

But this sum was previously considered. We had calculated the sum over all Qi = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 values. Let us compute:

sum_{all states} [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ].

However, given that sum over S1, S2, S3 of Qi = sum of sum over each term S1S2, S1 S3, S2 S3.

But for any pair sum:

sum_{S1, S2,S3} S1 S2 is equal to 4. What's ？

Wait, let me double-check.

Sum over all states of S1S2: Each state has S1 and S2, which can be +1,+1; +1,-1; -1, +1; -1, -1. For each possible value of S3 (S3 does not affect the product S1 S2). So for each of the four possible combinations of S1, S2, there are two states (S3=±1). Then Sum_{S1,S2,S3} S1S2 = Sum_{S1,S2} [S1S2 * (Sum_{S3} 1) ] = Sum_{S1,S2} [S1S2 * 2 ].

Now Sum_{S1, S2} S1S2 = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 +1 = 0. Hence Sum_{S1,S2,S3} S1S2 = 0.

Same applies to sum over S1 S3 and sum over S2 S3. Each pair sum is (1*1 + 1*(-1) + ...)=0. Therefore, the total sum over all states of [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ] = 0 +0 +0=0.

Therefore, thus Z = sum [ A³ + B³ ] + A B (A + B ) * (sum [ S1S2 + ... ]) = [A³ + B³ ] *8 + A B (A + B )]*0 => Z =8( A³ + B³ ).

But wait, but there seems to be a miscalculation here. Wait, A = cosh(K), B = sinh(K). Hence,

Z =8( cosh^3(K) + sinh^3(K) ).?.

Wait, but according to the previous calculation through enumeration, it should be Z = 2 e^{3K} +6 e^{ -K }, K =beta J. But according to this factorization approach, when using A=cosh(K), B= sinh(K):

Z= 8( A^3 + B^3 ), Which is supposed to equal 2 e^{3K} +6 e^{-K}. Let's check whether these are equivalent.

For K=beta J,

Compute 8(cosh^3 K+ sinh^3 K).

Express e^{K} : cosh K = (e^K + e^{-K})/2, sinh K = (e^K - e^{-K})/2.

Compute  sinh^3 K = [ (e^k - e^{-k}) / 2 ]^3 = (e^{3K} - 3 e^{K} + 3 e^{-K} - e^{-3K} ) /8.

Similarly, cosh^3 K= [ (e^K + e^{-K} }/2 ]^3= (e^{3K} + 3 e^K + 3 e^{-K } + e^{-3K}) /8.

Therefore, sum cosh³ K + sinh³ K= [ (e^{3K} + 3 e^K + 3 e^{-K } + e^{-3K} ) + (e^{3K} - 3 e^{K} + 3 e^{-K} - e^{-3K} ) ] /8

= [2 e^{3K} +0 +6 e^{-K} +0 ] / 8= [ e^{3K} +3 e^{-K} ] /4.

Hence, 8 (cosh³K + sinh³K )=8*( [ e^{3K} + 3 e^{-K} ] /4 )= 2 e^{3K} +6 e^{-K }, which matches the Z calculated via enumeration.

Thus, finally agreement here.

Hence expliclt in terms of exponentials, the partition function is indeed Z=2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{- beta J}. Therefore, this scratch reaffirming proves the result holds.

Therefore, the answer definitely is Z=2 e^{3β J} +6 e^{ -beta J}. \

Alternatively, it can be expressed in a simplified form (if applicable). When written as ( e^{3K} multiplied by certain terms...

Alternatively., perhaps can rewrite:

e^{ - beta J} [ 2 e^{4 beta J} +6 ]， but no need here. The expression provided is already in terms of exponentials succinctly separated.

Conclusion: After multiple methods of derivation—direct enumeration, spin sums factorization, high-temperature expansion/trigonometric expansions—all lead to the same partition function Z = 2 e^{3βJ} + 6 e^{-β J}.

Hence the answer is confirmed and correct.

**Final Answer**
The partition function is \boxed{Z = 2 e^{3\beta J} + 6 e^{-\beta J}}.
