To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of each component:**
   - **CH₃COOH:** \(0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}\)
   - **HCl:** \(0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}\) (completely dissociates into \(0.08 \, \text{mol H⁺}\) and \(0.08 \, \text{mol Cl⁻}\))
   - **Ba(OH)₂:** \(0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}\) (each mole provides 2 moles of OH⁻, so \(0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol OH⁻}\))

2. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - **HCl (H⁺) and Ba(OH)₂ (OH⁻):** 
     - \(0.08 \, \text{mol H⁺}\) reacts with \(0.08 \, \text{mol OH⁻}\), leaving \(0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol OH⁻}\)
   - **Excess OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:**
     - \(0.10 \, \text{mol OH⁻}\) reacts with \(0.05 \, \text{mol CH₃COOH}\), leaving \(0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol OH⁻}\)

3. **Calculate concentration of excess OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of solution: \(500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}\)
   - Concentration of OH⁻: \(\frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}\)

4. **Determine pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log_{10}(0.0417) \approx 1.38 \)
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} \approx 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \)

Thus, the pH of the solution is \(\boxed{12.62}\).

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing different volumes and concentrations of acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to remember how to handle mixing solutions like this. I know that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, their reaction will probably be the first thing to consider. Then, the acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid, so it might not dissociate completely, but since there's a strong base involved, maybe some of it will get neutralized? Wait, but the order of mixing might matter too. Hmm. Let me think.

The question gives three components: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. To find the pH of the final solution, I need to figure out how much H+ and OH- ions are present after mixing everything, and then see if there's an excess of one over the other. If there's excess H+, pH will be less than 7; if excess OH-, pH is more than 7.

But wait, with a weak acid and a strong base involved, the neutralization might not be straightforward. Let me start by calculating the moles of each component.

Starting with CH₃COOH: 500 mL is 0.5 L, so moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate, but maybe when mixed with a strong base like Ba(OH)₂, they might react?

Next, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L, so moles HCl = 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely into H+ and Cl⁻ ions. So there's 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl.

Then Ba(OH)₂: 300 mL is 0.3 L, concentration is 0.3 M. Each formula unit of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻ ions because it's Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻. So moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Then OH⁻ ions: multiply by 2, so 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of OH⁻.

Now, because H+ (from HCl and possibly CH₃COOH) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) can react to form water. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH⁻ → H₂O.

But first, need to see total H+ available. Since HCl is a strong acid, all 0.08 moles of H+ is available. But what about acetic acid? Since it's a weak acid, does it contribute H+ before neutralization or after? Wait, the presence of H+ from HCl may affect the dissociation of acetic acid. Because if there's a lot of H+ already in solution from HCl, the common ion effect would suppress the dissociation of CH₃COOH. So perhaps we can assume that the contribution of H+ from CH₃COOH is negligible compared to that of HCl. That simplifies things a bit.

So total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. Then we have OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ of 0.18 moles. These will neutralize each other. Let's compute which one is in excess.

The reaction is H+ + OH⁻ → H₂O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

Available H+ = 0.08 mol, OH⁻ = 0.18 mol.

If 0.08 mol H+ reacts with 0.08 mol OH⁻, that leaves 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of OH⁻ remaining.

So the excess OH⁻ is 0.10 moles. But wait, that's not considering the acetate buffer or anything. Wait, the presence of CH₃COOH might play a role here.

Wait, after the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)₂, the OH⁻ left over is 0.1mol, but we also have some CH₃COOH. Does the OH⁻ react with CH₃COOH? Because OH⁻ is a strong base, it will deprotonate the weak acid. The reaction would be:

CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.

So, these 0.10 mol of OH⁻ will react with the 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH. Let me check the moles here. They are stoichiometric, so 1 mole of OH⁻ reacts with 1 mole of CH₃COOH.

So the available OH⁻: 0.10 mol. The moles of CH₃COOH: 0.05 mol. Therefore, OH⁻ in excess?

Wait, actually, how much OH⁻ can react with CH₃COOH? Since CH₃COOH is only 0.05 moles. So the OH⁻ (0.10 mol) will react with all 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH first:

0.05 mol CH₃COOH + 0.05 mol OH⁻ → 0.05 mol CH₃COO⁻ + 0.05 mol H2O.

Then, the remaining OH⁻ is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So then, we have 0.05 mol excess OH⁻ in solution. Now, we also have the acetate ions produced. Then to calculate pH, because there's excess OH⁻, the solution should be basic, so pH >7. The concentration of OH⁻ can be calculated by moles of OH⁻ excess divided by total volume.

But let's get that step by step.

First, total volume of the solution is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

First, track all components:

Start with HCl providing 0.08 H+ and Cl⁻ = 0.08.

Ba(OH)₂ provides Ba²+ = 0.09 and OH⁻ = 0.18.

Then HCl and Ba(OH)₂ react: 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH⁻ → H2O. So after that:

H+ left: 0.

OH⁻ left: 0.18 -0.08=0.10

Then, the remaining OH⁻ (0.10) reacts with CH₃COOH (0.05):

CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H2O.

Reaction consumes 0.05 OH⁻ and 0.05 CH3COOH, producing 0.05 CH3COO⁻.

So now, remaining OH⁻: 0.10 -0.05=0.05 mol.

CH3COOH left: 0.05 -0.05=0.

CH3COO⁻: 0.05 mol.

So now, all that should be left is OH⁻ (0.05 mol), Ba²+ (0.09 mol), Cl⁻ (0.08 mol), and CH3COO⁻ (0.05 mol).

But need to make sure all ions are accounted for, including those from the neutralization steps.

Wait, after reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)₂:

Original: HCl is H+ and Cl⁻ (0.08 HCl → 0.08 H+, 0.08 Cl⁻)

Ba(OH)₂: 0.09 Ba²+ and 0.18 OH-

Then the H+ (0.08) reacts with OH- (0.18) to form H2O. Remainder:

H+: 0

OH-: 0.10

Cl⁻ stays: 0.08

Ba²+: 0.09

Then the OH- (0.10 mol) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol). So OH- left:0.05, and we have 0.05 CH3COO⁻ from that reaction.

So final ions in solution:

Cl⁻: 0.08 mol

Ba²+: 0.09 mol

CH3COO⁻: 0.05 mol

OH⁻: 0.05 mol

Now, to find the concentration of OH⁻, you need the total volume:

Total volume = 0.5 L + 0.4 L + 0.3 L = 1.2 L. So 1.2 liters.

Concentration of [OH⁻] = 0.05 mol /1.2 L ≈0.0417 M

Wait, or did I make a calculation mistake here? 0.05 divided by 1.2. Let me compute that:

0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... ~0.0417 M.

So pOH = -log10 [OH⁻] = -log10(0.0417) ≈?

First, since log(0.0417) can be calculated as log(4.17 × 10^-2) = log(4.17) + (-2).

log(4.17) ≈0.620, so log(4.17x10^-2)=0.620 -2 = -1.380.

Wait, no. Wait: Actually, 0.0417 = 4.17 x10^-2. So log(4.17 x10^-2)= log(4.17) + log(10^-2) ≈ 0.620 -2 = -1.380. So pOH = -(-1.380) ≈1.38.

Then pH =14 - pOH ≈14 -1.38≈12.62. But let me verify this calculation more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe use approximate values. But let's actually calculate log(0.0417):

Using calculator-style steps, maybe:

We know that log(0.04) is log(4x10^-2)= log(4)+log(10^-2)=0.60206 -2= -1.39794

And log(0.05)= log(5x10^-2)= log(5)+log(10^-2)=0.69897 -2= -1.30103

Our value is 0.0417, which is 0.04 +0.0017. Since it's closer to 0.04 than 0.05. Maybe approximate using linear interpolation between log(0.04) and log(0.05). The difference between log(0.04) and log(0.05) is (-1.30103) - (-1.39794) =0.09691 over the interval 0.04 to 0.05, so 0.017 past 0.04 equals how much?

Wait, 0.0417 is 0.04 +0.0017. The interval between 0.04 and 0.05 is 0.01, which gives a difference in log of 0.09691.

Thus, 0.0017/0.01 = 0.17. So change in log is 0.09691 *0.17≈0.016475. So add about -1.39794 +0.016475≈ Wait, no. Because as x increases, log increases. So moving from x=0.04 upwards, the log increases from -1.39794 to -1.30103. So over 0.04 to 0.05, each additional 0.001 in x should add approximately 0.09691 / 0.01 (per 0.001). So 0.0017 past 0.04 is 0.0017 beyond x=0.04. So the amount added to log would be 0.0017/0.01 =0.17 of the total delta 0.09691, so 0.09691 * 0.17 ≈0.016475. So log(0.0417)≈log(0.04) +0.016475≈-1.39794 +0.016475≈-1.38146

Therefore, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈1.3815. So pH=14 -1.3815≈12.6185≈12.62.

So the pH should be approximately 12.62. Let me check if that makes sense.

But wait a second, after considering all that, but maybe I neglected the contribution from the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻) in solution. For instance, after neutralizing the acid with OH⁻, we have 0.05 moles of acetate ion. However, the presence of acetate ion (a weak base) could hydrolyze in water to produce a small amount of OH⁻. But since we have excess OH⁻ (from the strong base), would that hydrolysis contribute anything significant?

In this case, the solution already has a significant concentration of OH⁻ (0.0417 M, pOH≈1.38→pH 12.62). The acetate ion does undergo hydrolysis: CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻. However, since the solution is already strongly basic, the contribution from acetate hydrolysis would be minimal in comparison. The OH⁻ from excess Ba(OH)₂ will dominate the pH calculation, so it's safe to ignore the acetate's hydrolysis in this scenario. Similarly, the presence of acetate won't significantly raise the pH higher than the excess OH- does.

Therefore, using the concentration of OH⁻ (0.0417 M) gives pH≈12.62. However, maybe the exact value would need precise calculation. Alternatively, rely on that number.

But let me double-check my initial mixing calculations.

First, moles of each component:

HCl: 0.4 L ×0.2 M=0.08 mol HCl→0.08 H+ and 0.08 Cl⁻.

Ba(OH)₂: 0.3 L ×0.3 M=0.09 mol Ba(OH)₂. Each provides 2 OH⁻, so 0.18 mol OH⁻ and 0.09mol Ba²+.

CH3COOH:0.5 L ×0.1 M=0.05 mol, which is a weak acid. First reaction: H+ from HCl (strong acid, 0.08 mol) and OH- from Ba(OH)₂ (0.18 mol). Since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)₂ a strong base, they first react completely. So H+ + OH⁻→ H2O. So 0.08 H+ is neutralized by 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 mol OH-. This OH⁻ then reacts with whatever can give H+—in this case, CH3COOH. So 0.10 OH⁻ will deprotonate CH3COOH (0.05 mol). Since it's a 1:1 reaction, consuming 0.05 mol OH⁻ and 0.05 mol CH3COOH, which converts to 0.05 mol CH3COO⁻. Then, unreacted OH- is 0.05 mol, CH3COO⁻ is 0.05 mol, Ba²+ 0.09, Cl⁻ 0.08.

Total volume=0.5 +0.4 +0.3=1.2L.

So [OH⁻]=0.05 /1.2≈0.0417 M, so pOH=1.38, and pH=12.62. So the answer should be around 12.62. But perhaps need to check again.

But wait, another way to see: you have a total of 0.05 mol OH⁻ in 1.2L. So,

Hydroxide concentration is 0.05 /1.2 ≈0.0416666 M. So [OH⁻]=4.166…×10^-2. Thus, pOH= – log(4.166…×10^-2)=–(log(4.166…)+log(10^-2))= –(0.6198 –2)=–(-1.3802)=1.3802. Then pH=14 –1.3802≈12.6198. So 12.62.

Thus, pH≈12.62, so the answer's pH is approximately 12.62.

But maybe the problem expects a certain number of decimal places. Given the input data's sig figs: let's check.

The original data has 500 mL, 0.1 M CH3COOH (0.1 has one decimal place, volume two), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (0.2, one; volume 400 two), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (0.3, one decimal; 300 two). The least precise concentration values are to one decimal, so pH should be presented to two decimal places, but considering the mixed concentrations. Wait: in pH, the number of sig figs is determined by the decimal places in the concentration. For pH calculations, the number after the decimal is usually given two places. Alternatively, since the mols have two significant figures (0.05, 0.08, 0.09), and volume has two (1.2L), then 0.05/1.2. Let me see:

0.05 mol /1.2 L=0.0416666… M. So [OH⁻]=0.0417 (rounded to three places). Then pOH=1.38 (two decimal places), and pH=14 -1.38=12.62.

Hence, the answer would be around 12.62 or similar. Check if that makes sense. If there’s excess strong base, pH is high, which aligns. So why's the answer around 12.62. Alternatively, if we’re taught different rounding rules, it could vary slightly, but I think 12.62 is correct.

Wait, perhaps another sanity check:

If you have 0.05 mol OH⁻ in 1.2 L, that's 0.0417 M. To check [OH⁻] = ~0.04 M. pH would be roughly 12.6 because pH + pOH =14; 0.04 M is 4e-2, so pOH ~1.4, pH 12.6. So the value of approx 12.6 makes sense.

Thus, the answer is around 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. Did we mix the order correctly? For instance, when you mix HCl and Ba(OH)₂, which would lead to their neutralization first. But since acetate's a weak acid, doesn't really interfere with their reaction. Then whichever acid is stronger would be neutralized first. But since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, their neutralization occurs first.

Wait after HCl and Ba(OH)₂ neutralize each other:

H+ (0.08) + OH⁻ (0.18) → 0.08 H2O. Leaving 0.1 OH⁻. Then the remaining OH⁻ first reacts with CH3COOH. Correct, since it's the next available acid.

Alternatively, if solutions are mixed, and once Ba(OH)₂ is added to HCl and acetic acid, the strong base would first neutralize the strong acid (HCl), and then the excess OH⁻ would neutralize the weak acid (CH3COOH).

But that is what I considered. Which steps:

1. Calculate total H+ from HCl.

2. Total OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂.

3. Neutralization between H+ and OH⁻ leads to OH in excess.

4. Then remaining OH⁻ neutralizes some of the weak acid (if present) – as per the steps above.

So steps are correct, so the answer is as such.

Conclusion: pH≈12.62. Is there any part I missed? For instance the barium ions or chloride ions? I don't think they contribute to the acidity calculation here. Barium is a spectator ion, chloride is also a spectator. The key players are hydroxide, and acetate (which is a weak base but here if there's excess OH⁻, its effect is negligible).

Thus, the final pH should be approximately 12.62. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{12.62} Maybe using two decimal places as in the initial steps, but avoiding trailing zeros to make it 12.6 if only one decimal, but given the moles as 0.05 (two sig figs), perhaps they keep it to two. But combining all steps, the answer usually would be reported with two decimal places. So 12.62.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{12.62}

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing different volumes and concentrations of acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.

So the excess OH⁻ is 0.10 moles. But wait, that's not considering the acetate buffer or anything. Wait, the presence of CH₃COOH might play a role here.

Wait, after the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)₂, the OH⁻ left over is 0.1mol, but we also have some CH₃COOH. Does the OH⁻ react with CH₃COOH? Because OH⁻ is a strong base, it will depro

I'm faced with a chemistry problem involving the determination of pH in a mixed solution containing acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. This seems complicated, but I'll approach it systematically.

When mixing acids and bases, neutralization reactions occur. HCl is a strong acid while Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so their interaction should be considered first. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is weak and may not completely dissociate, though some neutralization might happen with the strong base present. The mixing sequence could also be relevant.

The problem provides three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. To determine the final pH, I need to calculate the concentrations of H+ and OH- ions after mixing and identify which is in excess. An excess of H+ indicates pH below 7, while excess OH- means pH above 7.

Let me calculate the moles of each component:

For CH₃COOH: 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Being a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate, but might react with a strong base.

For HCl: 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it completely dissociates, yielding 0.08 moles of H+.

For Ba(OH)₂: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each Ba(OH)₂ molecule produces 2 OH- ions, so there's 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

The neutralization reaction follows the equation H+ + OH- → H₂O.

For total available H+, HCl contributes 0.08 moles. The contribution from acetic acid might be minimal due to the common ion effect from HCl, which could suppress acetic acid's dissociation.

With 0.08 moles of H+ and 0.18 moles of OH-, they neutralize in a 1:1 ratio. After 0.08 moles of each react, 0.10 moles of OH- remain.

However, I need to consider whether this excess OH- might react with CH₃COOH, as OH- is a strong base that could deprotonate the weak acid.

Alright, so I'm faced with this chemistry problem here: I need to find the pH of a solution formed by combining different volumes and concentrations of acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. It seems a bit intricate, but let me attempt to break it down systematically.

To start, it's important to remember the principles behind mixing such solutions. When acids and bases mix, they have the potential to neutralize each other. With HCl being a strong acid and Ba(OH)₂ a strong base, their interaction is likely the primary focus. The acetic acid (CH₃COOH), on the other hand, is a weak acid and might not dissociate fully, but the presence of a strong base could lead to some neutralization. Additionally, the sequence in which these are mixed might matter, so let's think this through.

The problem specifies three components: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. To determine the pH of the resulting solution, I need to calculate the amount of H+ and OH- ions remaining after mixing, and identify any excess. An excess of H+ will result in a pH below 7, while an OH- excess will result in a pH above 7.

Considering the weak acid and strong base, the neutralization might not be straightforward. Let's begin by calculating the moles for each component.

For CH₃COOH: 500 mL equals 0.5 L, yielding moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since acetic acid is weak, it doesn't fully dissociate, but it may react with a strong base like Ba(OH)₂.

For HCl: 400 mL equals 0.4 L, and moles of HCl = 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Being a strong acid, HCl will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl⁻ ions, contributing 0.08 moles of H+.

For Ba(OH)₂: 300 mL is equivalent to 0.3 L with a concentration of 0.3 M. Given that one unit of Ba(OH)₂ supplies 2 OH⁻ ions, calculate moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. This amounts to 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of OH⁻.

Next, we need to consider how the H+ (from HCl and potentially CH₃COOH) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) neutralize to form water, following the reaction: H+ + OH⁻ → H₂O.

First, ascertain the total H+ present. All of the 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl are available for reaction. Regarding acetic acid, as a weak acid, does it contribute H+ before or after neutralization? The abundance of H+ from HCl might suppress CH₃COOH dissociation due to the common ion effect, implying that acetic acid’s contribution to H+ is probably minimal in comparison to HCl. This simplifies our calculation.

Thus, we have 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl. With 0.18 moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂, these ions neutralize each other. Now, let's identify the remaining excess.

According to the reaction H+ + OH⁻ → H₂O, the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1.

We have 0.08 mol of H+ available to neutralize 0.08 mol of OH⁻, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of excess OH⁻.

This results in 0.10 moles of excess OH⁻. But hold on, I haven't accounted for any buffer action. The presence of CH₃COOH may have a role. After neutralizing HCl and Ba(OH)₂, if 0.1 mol of OH⁻ remains, will it react with CH₃COOH? As OH⁻ is a strong base, it might deprotonate CH₃COOH.

So OH⁻ will react with CH₃COOH:\n\nCH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.\n\nSo let\'s check: moles of OH⁻ remaining after neutralizing HCl\'s H+ is 0.10 mol. Then there\'s 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH available to react with the excess OH⁻. So the reaction equation here:\n\nEach mole of OH⁻ can neutralize a mole of CH₃COOH. So since there\'s 0.05 mol CH₃COOH and 0.10 mol OH⁻, the OH⁻ will first react with CH₃COOH. The CH₃COOH is 0.05 mol, so after reacting, OH⁻ will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol left. Then, the acetic acid would be converted entirely into acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻).\n\nSo after all that, the excess OH⁻ is 0.05 mol. Then the final solution has excess OH⁻ of 0.05 mol. The total volume is the sum of all solutions: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. So concentration of OH⁻ is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = approx 0.0417 M. Then pOH is -log(0.0417) and pH = 14 - pOH.\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nFirst, steps:\n\n1. Calculate moles of each component:\n\nCH₃COOH: 0.05 mol\n\nHCl: 0.08 mol H+\n\nBa(OH)₂: 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol OH⁻\n\nNext, H+ (from HCl) and OH⁻ react:\n\n0.08 mol H+ + 0.18 mol OH⁻ → 0.08 mol H2O and leaves 0.10 mol OH⁻.\n\nThen, the remaining OH⁻ (0.10 mol) reacts with CH₃COOH (0.05 mol):\n\nOH⁻ + CH₃COOH → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.\n\nAfter reaction, 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH⁻ left.\n\nSo total OH⁻ concentration = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.\n\nThen pH = 14 - (-log(0.0417)).\n\nCalculating -log(0.0417):\n\nLet me calculate that. 0.0417 ≈ 4.17 × 10^-2. So log(4.17 ×10^-2) = log(4.17) + log(10^-2) ≈ 0.6201 - 2 = -1.3799. So -log(0.0417) = 1.3799. Therefore, pOH ≈ 1.38, pH ≈ 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nWait, that seems basic, which makes sense because there\'s excess OH-.\n\nBut let me check if I considered all steps correctly.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let\'s recount:\n\nAfter mixing:\n\nTotal H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.\n\nTotal OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18 mol.\n\nH+ and OH⁻ neutralize each other. H+ is 0.08 and OH⁻ 0.18. So after neutralization:\n\nExcess OH⁻: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.\n\nThen, that excess OH⁻ reacts with the weak acid CH₃COOH. The moles of CH₃COOH are 0.05 mol. So OH⁻ (0.10 mol) is in excess here; OH⁻ can neutralize all 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH and still have OH⁻ left.\n\nSo after reaction with acetic acid, remaining OH⁻ is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo the OH⁻ concentration is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, so 0.0417 M. Then pH is 14 - log(0.0417). Let me check that.\n\nLog(0.0417) is same as log(4.17×10^-2) = log(4.17) + (-2). Log(4.17): 4.17 is between 10^0.62 (≈4.17). So log(4.17) ≈ 0.62. So log(0.0417) ≈ 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. Therefore, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nThat seems right. But I should verify.\n\nWait, but wait: when OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH, producing CH₃COO⁻. But do we need to consider the acetate in solution?\n\nIf there is excess OH⁻ after neutralizing all CH₃COOH, the acetate ion concentration will be 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. However, in the presence of excess OH⁻, will the acetate ion hydrolyze? No, because OH⁻ is a strong base; acetate is a weak base. But since OH⁻ is strong, it suppresses the hydrolysis of acetate. Therefore, the dominant factor is the excess OH⁻. So yes, the pH is determined by the excess OH⁻.\n\nTherefore, final answer pH ≈ 12.62. Rounded properly, let\'s check the precision.\n\nWait, the concentrations given are in 0.1, 0.2, 0.3. Significant figures: volumes given as 500, 400, 300 mL, all with one or two sig figs? Hmm, if the volumes are given as exact (since 500 mL could be considered as 500. mL which is three sig figs), but maybe here you consider 500 as one sig fig, 400 as one, 300 as one. Hmmm. However, usually, when numbers are written without a decimal, trailing zeros may be ambiguous, but in real problems, they often specify. However, maybe answer to two decimal places is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, compute exactly. Let me go back through the calculations with exact numbers.\n\nFirst, moles:\n\nCH₃COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol\n\nHCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol\n\nBa(OH)₂: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → OH⁻: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.\n\nTotal volume: 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.2 L.\n\nHCl reacts with Ba(OH)₂\'s OH-:\n\nH+ = 0.08 mol, OH⁻ = 0.18 mol → excess OH- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol\n\nThen, OH- reacts with CH₃COOH:\n\n0.05 mol CH₃COOH neutralizes 0.05 mol OH⁻, so excess OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.\n\nTherefore, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. So log(0.041666...)\n\nlog(4.1666... ×10^-2) = log(4.1666) - 2.\n\nLog(4.1666) is: since log(4) = 0.60206, log(4.1666) is approx 0.6197 (since 4.1666 is 10^(0.6197)). Alternatively, my calculator:\n\nUsing log(4.1666) = ln(4.1666)/ln(10) ≈ 1.4278/2.3026 ≈ 0.620. So then log(4.1666*10^-2) ≈ 0.620 - 2 = -1.380, so [OH-] = 10^-1.38 ≈ 0.0417 M. Therefore, pOH = 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.\n\nSo, is the pH 12.62? Let me check if I made a mistake in any steps. Although I also need to remember that barium hydroxide is a strong base, so when dissolved, each mole gives two hydroxide ions.\n\nSo with 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)₂, which gives 0.18 moles OH⁻: that\'s correct. Then HCl is a strong acid, so in 0.4 L of 0.2 M HCl, it\'s 0.08 moles H+. Then those 0.08 H+ neutralizes 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 OH-.\n\nThen, this 0.10 OH- can neutralize 0.05 moles of acetic acid, giving 0.05 moles of acetate, and 0.05 OH- remaining. Then yes, the OH- is at 0.05 mol, final concentration 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.\n\nSo concentration is okay. pH 12.62. The acetate anions are present in 0.05 mol, but in presence of excess OH-, their contribution is negligible. Therefore, correct.\n\nBut another thought: When mixing HCl (strong acid) and Ba(OH)₂ (strong base), the reaction actually first occurs between H+ and OH- to form water. Then if some OH- is left, it will deprotonate the acetic acid. So that part is correct. So all steps accounted for.\n\nWait a second, let me check for any possibilities that I might have miscalculated something. For example, volume.\n\nTotal volume should be 500+400+300=1200 mL=1.2 L. Moles calculations also check out. Yes, 0.1*0.5 gives 0.05 moles CH₃COOH. HCl 0.2*0.4=0.08. Ba(OH)₂ 0.3*0.3=0.09, with OH- 0.18. Yep.\n\nThen reaction between H+ and OH- subtracts 0.08 from OH-, getting 0.10. Then subtract 0.05 moles in reaction with acetic acid. Then total OH- 0.05. Correct.\n\nYes, seems right.\n\nTherefore, pH is ≈12.62, which is approximately 12.62, so I can write the answer as 12.62.\n\nAlternatively, exact calculation.\n\nBut since the problem says "determine the pH", requires probably two decimal places. So maybe 12.62 is okay. Let\'s compute more precise pOH value.\n\nCalculating [OH-] exactly: 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.\n\nTo find pOH, -log10(0.0416667).\n\nLet me get a more accurate value for log(0.0416667).\n\nSince 0.0416667 is 1/24, because 1/25 is 0.04, 1/24≈0.0416667. So log(1/24)= -log(24). Let me find log(24). 24 is 2.4×10^1. So log(24) = log(2.4*10) = log(2.4) + log(10) = 0.3802 + 1 = 1.3802. So log(1/24) = -1.3802, so pOH = 1.3802, pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198, which is ≈12.62.\n\nSo 12.62 seems accurate. So I\'ll box that as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe pH of the solution is \\boxed{12.62}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743813432, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3208, prompt_tokens=1027, total_tokens=4235, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of each component:**
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):** \(0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}\)
   - **HCl (strong acid):** \(0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol H⁺}\)
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):** \(0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂}\)
     - Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of OH⁻: \(0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol OH⁻}\)

2. **Neutralization of H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂):**
   - Reaction: \(\text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}\)
   - Moles of H⁺ from HCl: 0.08 mol
   - Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18 mol
   - Excess OH⁻ after reaction: \(0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol}\)

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**
   - Reaction: \(\text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}\)
   - Moles of CH₃COOH: 0.05 mol
   - Moles of OH⁻ remaining after reaction: \(0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol}\)

4. **Final concentration of OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of solution: \(500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}\)
   - Concentration of OH⁻: \(\frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}\)

5. **Calculate pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38 \)
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \)

The pH of the solution is \(\boxed{12.62}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

tonate the weak acid. So OH⁻ will react with CH₃COOH:

CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.

So let's check: moles of OH⁻ remaining after neutralizing HCl's H+ is 0.10 mol. Then there's 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH available to react with the excess OH⁻. So the reaction equation here:

Each mole of OH⁻ can neutralize a mole of CH₃COOH. So since there's 0.05 mol CH₃COOH and 0.10 mol OH⁻, the OH⁻ will first react with CH₃COOH. The CH₃COOH is 0.05 mol, so after reacting, OH⁻ will be 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol left. Then, the acetic acid would be converted entirely into acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻).

So after all that, the excess OH⁻ is 0.05 mol. Then the final solution has excess OH⁻ of 0.05 mol. The total volume is the sum of all solutions: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. So concentration of OH⁻ is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = approx 0.0417 M. Then pOH is -log(0.0417) and pH = 14 - pOH.

Wait, let me confirm.

First, steps:

1. Calculate moles of each component:

CH₃COOH: 0.05 mol

HCl: 0.08 mol H+

Ba(OH)₂: 0.09 mol → 0.18 mol OH⁻

Next, H+ (from HCl) and OH⁻ react:

0.08 mol H+ + 0.18 mol OH⁻ → 0.08 mol H2O and leaves 0.10 mol OH⁻.

Then, the remaining OH⁻ (0.10 mol) reacts with CH₃COOH (0.05 mol):

OH⁻ + CH₃COOH → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O.

After reaction, 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH⁻ left.

So total OH⁻ concentration = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

Then pH = 14 - (-log(0.0417)).

Calculating -log(0.0417):

Let me calculate that. 0.0417 ≈ 4.17 × 10^-2. So log(4.17 ×10^-2) = log(4.17) + log(10^-2) ≈ 0.6201 - 2 = -1.3799. So -log(0.0417) = 1.3799. Therefore, pOH ≈ 1.38, pH ≈ 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, that seems basic, which makes sense because there's excess OH-.

But let me check if I considered all steps correctly.

Wait, maybe not. Let's recount:

After mixing:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18 mol.

H+ and OH⁻ neutralize each other. H+ is 0.08 and OH⁻ 0.18. So after neutralization:

Excess OH⁻: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Then, that excess OH⁻ reacts with the weak acid CH₃COOH. The moles of CH₃COOH are 0.05 mol. So OH⁻ (0.10 mol) is in excess here; OH⁻ can neutralize all 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH and still have OH⁻ left.

So after reaction with acetic acid, remaining OH⁻ is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So the OH⁻ concentration is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, so 0.0417 M. Then pH is 14 - log(0.0417). Let me check that.

Log(0.0417) is same as log(4.17×10^-2) = log(4.17) + (-2). Log(4.17): 4.17 is between 10^0.62 (≈4.17). So log(4.17) ≈ 0.62. So log(0.0417) ≈ 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. Therefore, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

That seems right. But I should verify.

Wait, but wait: when OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH, producing CH₃COO⁻. But do we need to consider the acetate in solution?

If there is excess OH⁻ after neutralizing all CH₃COOH, the acetate ion concentration will be 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. However, in the presence of excess OH⁻, will the acetate ion hydrolyze? No, because OH⁻ is a strong base; acetate is a weak base. But since OH⁻ is strong, it suppresses the hydrolysis of acetate. Therefore, the dominant factor is the excess OH⁻. So yes, the pH is determined by the excess OH⁻.

Therefore, final answer pH ≈ 12.62. Rounded properly, let's check the precision.

Wait, the concentrations given are in 0.1, 0.2, 0.3. Significant figures: volumes given as 500, 400, 300 mL, all with one or two sig figs? Hmm, if the volumes are given as exact (since 500 mL could be considered as 500. mL which is three sig figs), but maybe here you consider 500 as one sig fig, 400 as one, 300 as one. Hmmm. However, usually, when numbers are written without a decimal, trailing zeros may be ambiguous, but in real problems, they often specify. However, maybe answer to two decimal places is acceptable.

Alternatively, compute exactly. Let me go back through the calculations with exact numbers.

First, moles:

CH₃COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol

Ba(OH)₂: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → OH⁻: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Total volume: 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.2 L.

HCl reacts with Ba(OH)₂'s OH-:

H+ = 0.08 mol, OH⁻ = 0.18 mol → excess OH- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol

Then, OH- reacts with CH₃COOH:

0.05 mol CH₃COOH neutralizes 0.05 mol OH⁻, so excess OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Therefore, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. So log(0.041666...)

log(4.1666... ×10^-2) = log(4.1666) - 2.

Log(4.1666) is: since log(4) = 0.60206, log(4.1666) is approx 0.6197 (since 4.1666 is 10^(0.6197)). Alternatively, my calculator:

Using log(4.1666) = ln(4.1666)/ln(10) ≈ 1.4278/2.3026 ≈ 0.620. So then log(4.1666*10^-2) ≈ 0.620 - 2 = -1.380, so [OH-] = 10^-1.38 ≈ 0.0417 M. Therefore, pOH = 1.38, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

So, is the pH 12.62? Let me check if I made a mistake in any steps. Although I also need to remember that barium hydroxide is a strong base, so when dissolved, each mole gives two hydroxide ions.

So with 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)₂, which gives 0.18 moles OH⁻: that's correct. Then HCl is a strong acid, so in 0.4 L of 0.2 M HCl, it's 0.08 moles H+. Then those 0.08 H+ neutralizes 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 OH-.

Then, this 0.10 OH- can neutralize 0.05 moles of acetic acid, giving 0.05 moles of acetate, and 0.05 OH- remaining. Then yes, the OH- is at 0.05 mol, final concentration 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.

So concentration is okay. pH 12.62. The acetate anions are present in 0.05 mol, but in presence of excess OH-, their contribution is negligible. Therefore, correct.

But another thought: When mixing HCl (strong acid) and Ba(OH)₂ (strong base), the reaction actually first occurs between H+ and OH- to form water. Then if some OH- is left, it will deprotonate the acetic acid. So that part is correct. So all steps accounted for.

Wait a second, let me check for any possibilities that I might have miscalculated something. For example, volume.

Total volume should be 500+400+300=1200 mL=1.2 L. Moles calculations also check out. Yes, 0.1*0.5 gives 0.05 moles CH₃COOH. HCl 0.2*0.4=0.08. Ba(OH)₂ 0.3*0.3=0.09, with OH- 0.18. Yep.

Then reaction between H+ and OH- subtracts 0.08 from OH-, getting 0.10. Then subtract 0.05 moles in reaction with acetic acid. Then total OH- 0.05. Correct.

Yes, seems right.

Therefore, pH is ≈12.62, which is approximately 12.62, so I can write the answer as 12.62.

Alternatively, exact calculation.

But since the problem says "determine the pH", requires probably two decimal places. So maybe 12.62 is okay. Let's compute more precise pOH value.

Calculating [OH-] exactly: 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

To find pOH, -log10(0.0416667).

Let me get a more accurate value for log(0.0416667).

Since 0.0416667 is 1/24, because 1/25 is 0.04, 1/24≈0.0416667. So log(1/24)= -log(24). Let me find log(24). 24 is 2.4×10^1. So log(24) = log(2.4*10) = log(2.4) + log(10) = 0.3802 + 1 = 1.3802. So log(1/24) = -1.3802, so pOH = 1.3802, pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198, which is ≈12.62.

So 12.62 seems accurate. So I'll box that as the answer.

**Final Answer**
The pH of the solution is \boxed{12.62}.

So, in this reaction, OH- will react with all available CH3COOH first: 0.05 moles of OH- would neutralize 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.\n\nHowever, maybe I need to verify this. Wait, first: neutralize H+ from HCl with OH- from Ba(OH)₂:\n\nH+ (0.08) and OH- (0.18). H+ is less than OH-:\n\n0.08 moles H+ + 0.08 moles OH- → 0.08 moles H2O, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.\n\nBut there are acetate ions from CH3COOH. Since we have excess OH-, but acetic acid hasn't dissociated much because of HCl's presence.\n\nWait, perhaps in solution, the HCl's H+ will push the acetic acid's equilibrium to the left. Thus, CH3COOH remains primarily protonated. However, when mixing a strong base like Ba(OH)2, the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the strong acid, then from the weak acid.\n\nHmmm, order of neutralization is crucial here. Let me recall: when you have a mixture like this, strong acid and strong base react first. Then, excess strong base can react with weak acid.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Determine total H+ from HCl and any other sources, but here, CH3COOH's contribution is negligible in presence of HCl.\n\nBut actually, in reality, all strong acid H+ is available first, so H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, OH- 0.18 mol.\n\n- 0.08 moles of OH- neutralizes 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-.\n\nNow, the excess OH- can deprotonate CH3COOH since OH- is a strong base. So yes:\n\nmoles of CH3COOH: 0.05, moles of OH- remaining: 0.10.\n\nThe OH- is in excess. The reaction is:\n\nCH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O\n\nThis consumes OH- and CH3COOH in 1:1 ratio. Since CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, we can neutralize that with 0.05 OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.\n\nAfter this, the remaining solution's pH is determined by the concentration of the excess OH-.\n\nWait, but is this correct? Because when you mix a strong base with a weak acid and strong acid, neutralization occurs in steps:\n\n1. Strong acid (HCl) reacts first with strong base (Ba(OH)2) – each H+ from HCl consumes one OH- from Ba(OH)2.\n\nThen, if there's excess OH-, it will start reacting with the weak acid.\n\nSo after step 1: remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol\n\nStep 2: OH- reacts with CH3COOH.\n\nSince CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, OH- (0.10) consumes all CH3COOH (0.05) and leaves 0.05 mol OH-.\n\nThus, total excess OH- is then 0.05 mol. Then, to find pH, we need to know the concentration of OH- in the final solution.\n\nTotal volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\nSo [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. Then pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. So pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.\n\nAlternatively, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.041666... M. Correct. Then pOH is log(1/[OH]) ?\n\nYes, pOH = -log10 (0.041666) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.\n\nBut wait, is there anything else I should consider?\n\nFor example, after deprotonating all the CH3COOH with OH-, the solution's pH is determined by the excess OH- because it's a strong base. Since we have excess OH- left, the solution's basic, so yes, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 12.62.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculating moles?\n\nLet me summarize:\n\nTotal volume = 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL.\n\nHCl: 400 mL * 0.2 M = 80 mmol H+.\n\nBa(OH)₂: 300 mL * 0.3 M * 2 = 180 mmol OH- (because each Ba(OH)₂ gives 2 OH-).\n\nSo HCl contributes 80 mmol H+, Ba(OH)₂ contributes 180 mmol OH-. The H+ from CH3COOH is negligible here because HCl is a strong acid supressing its dissociation.\n\nSo first reaction: H+ neutralizes OH-:\n\n80 mmol H+ + 80 mmol OH- → 80 mmol H2O. OH- remaining: 180 - 80 = 100 mmol.\n\nThen, 100 mmol of OH- remaining.\n\nNow, OH- reacts with CH3COOH:\n\nCH3COOH: 500 mL * 0.1 M = 50 mmol.\n\nK for CH3COOH deprotonation with OH- is very large (since OH- is strong base). Therefore, OH- will deprotonate CH3COOH:\n\nOH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O.\n\nBut there are 50 mmol CH3COOH and 100 mmol OH-, so OH- will neutralize 50 mmol CH3COOH to produce 50 mmol CH3COO- and 50 mmol H2O, resulting in OH- remaining: 100 - 50 = 50 mmol.\n\nSo 50 mmol OH- in 1200 mL solution.\n\nConcentration of OH- = 50 mmol / 1200 mL = 0.041666... M.\n\nCalculate pOH: -log(0.041666) ≈ 1.38, so pH 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.\n\nBut let me recheck. Alternatively, another approach might account for possible contributors from the acetate ion.\n\nWait, the solution after reactions now contains:\n\n- 50 mmol of CH3COO-\n\n- 50 mmol of excess OH-\n\nThe other ions:\n\n- The initial HCl's Cl-: 0.08 mol (80 mmol). Neutralized as H+ is gone.\n\n- The initial Ba²+: comes from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 mol (90 mmol), since 300 mL 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 → 0.09 mol Ba²+.\n\nBut when Ba(OH)2 dissociates, it gives Ba²+ and 2 OH-. The neutralization by HCl uses OH- but not affects the Ba²+ concentration.\n\nSo after reactions, what is the composition?\n\nMajor species:\n\n- Ba²+: 0.09 mol (ignoring possible precipitation, but Ba(OH)2 is soluble?)\n\nWait, actually, I'm a bit hazy. Is Ba(OH)2 completely soluble? Maybe not in concentrated solutions—wait:\n\nBarium hydroxide is a strong base, so it's soluble in water. So Ba²+ and OH- ions are present.\n\nSo when neutralizing H+ (from HCl) with OH- from Ba(OH)2, the Ba²+ concentration remains: initially, we have 0.09 mol Ba²+ in 1.2 L.\n\nSo [Ba²+] = 0.09 mol /1.2 L = 0.075 M.\n\nNo problem, as long as the solution is not supersaturated; since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, soluble, so this concentration is okay.\n\nThe other ions:\n\nCl-: from HCl 0.08 mol → Let me see, total solution volume 1.2 L, so [Cl⁻] = 0.08 /1.2 ≈ 0.0667 M.\n\nCH3COO-: 50 mmol (0.05 mol) gives [CH3COO⁻] = 0.05 /1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.\n\nBut we also have excess OH-: 0.05 mol → [OH-] = 0.05 /1.2 ≈ 0.0417.\n\nSo the total solution contains these ions: Ba²+, Cl⁻, CH3COO⁻, and OH-.\n\nBut when there's excess OH- in solution and acetate ion, the acetate is a conjugate base of a weak acid but in basic solution, so would there be any acetate reacting?\n\nBut OH- is so strong that the presence of CH3COO⁻ likely won't generate more H+; since a strongly basic solution, the acetate ion doesn't undergo hydrolysis (in presence of excess OH-). The pH is determined by excess OH-.\n\nTherefore, the pH comes directly from the [OH-]: 0.0417 M.\n\nSo, as before, pH = 14 - (-log(0.0417)) ≈ 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using more precise log calculation:\n\n[OH-] = 0.041666... M.\n\nLog(0.041666) = log(4.1666×10^-2) = log(4.1666) + log(10^-2) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 ≈ -1.3802.\n\nTherefore, pOH = 1.3802, so pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198 ≈ 12.62.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nBut let me verify with another approach.\n\nAt the final step, after all neutralizations and reactions, the moles of excess OH- are 0.05 mol in 1.2 L. That's 0.041666 M => pH ≈12.62.\n\nAnother check:\n\nThe H+ from leftover water: but solution is dominated by excess OH-.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, verify using equilibrium of water.\n\nIf the [OH-] is 0.041666 M, then [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1e-14 / 0.041666 ≈ 2.4e-13, which gives pH = -log(2.4e-13) ≈12.62. That matches.\n\nAlternatively, there’s consideration of ionic strength and activity coefficients, but at this level, it's generally ignored. So the answer should indeed be ~12.62.\n\nHence, the pH of the solution is approximately 12.62, which rounds to 12.6 or perhaps written with two decimal places. Alternatively, exactly 0.041666 M OH- → pOH = 1.380, pH=12.620, so 12.62. Those might format as 12.6 if two significant figures.\n\nWait, let's check significant figures. Let's start tracking:\n\nOriginal concentrations:\n\nCH3COOH: 500 mL (3 sig figs?) The 500 is ambiguous – if it's 500. ± ?\n\nBut in most problems, unless stated, maybe copied values with zeros ambiguous, but perhaps given as 0.1 M (2 sig figs), 0.2 M (2), 0.3 M (2). And volumes 500 mL (maybe 3?), but again mixed standards.\n\nAlternatively, sum it up: the moles.\n\nHCl: 0.1 ×0.5 =0.05 mol?  Or volumes. So for HCl, exact 400 mL (0.4 L).\n\nWait calculation:\n\nHCl: 400mL = 0.4 L; 0.2 M: 0.2 * 0.4 =0.0800 mol. So two significant figures (0.08).\n\nBa(OH)₂: 300mL=0.3 L; 0.3 M=0.3*0.3=0.09 mol, giving 0.18 mol OH- (two sig figs).\n\nCH3COOH:0.5 L *0.1 M=0.05 mol (two sig figs).\n\nSo after mixing:\n\nOH- after neutralizing HCl =0.10 mol (two sig figs). Then neutralizing CH3COOH (0.05) leaves 0.05 mol OH- (two sig figs but that's the tense part??).\n\nBut this would depend on consistency... This might incur intermediate steps with exact handling; maybe in the calculation steps, significant figures can be 2 or 3. However, when OH- ends up at 0.042 (two sig figs?), pH may be written with two decimal places such as 12.62, but perhaps we consider the minimal significant figures, which is 2 → so pH 12.62 can be written as 12.6 (properly two decimal places, significant figures).\n\nBut as not sure, perhaps he answer is phrased to two decimal places as it's a pH value. Alternatively, if operations, fractions are kept precise, answer may keep three sig figs. The volumes are probably all given to 2 or 3 sig figs. The exact numeric amount at the end has a concentration with two sig figs (0.0417 in my calc) but given that:\n\nH+ from the HCl is 0.08 mol, OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol (twu sig figs), moles are two sig figs. Then, when I reach 0.05 mol excess OH-, which is two significant figures. Volume total is 500+400+300=1200 ml = 1.2 L (two sig figs). Thus, molarity OH- is 0.05 /1.2 = 0.041666.... But with 1.2 L (two sig figs), and 0.05 (one sig fig?), wait:\n\nWait, No, the 0.05 moles of OH- comes from 0.10 (after HCl neutralization) minus 0.05 (CH3COOH) which is from solving steps. So if 0.10 is two sig figs, and 0.05 is two sig figs (since CH3COOH was given as 0.1 M two sig figs). So 0.05 with two sig figs (scale shifted with decimal), so when subtracted:\n\n0.10 (two) - 0.05 (two)=0.05 (two sig figs), yes. Then the volume is 1.2 L (two sig figs).\n\nThus when doing 0.05 /1.2 =0.041666..., with two significant figures: [OH-]≈ 0.042 M (two).\n\nThen pOH is -log(0.042) =1.3768. Then pH=12.6232. Often pH is given to two decimal places, which would be 12.62. But if we with a two significant figure precision (from the concentration which is two sig figs), pH is typically given to the number after the decimal: but well, pH has two decimal place digits (unless we have better data consistency). Alternatively, since the concentration is two sig figs (0.042 M), the pOH is 1.38 (rounded), so pH=12.62.\n\nIn many textbooks, students are advised not to round intermediate steps. So Correct Answer in two decimal places.\n\nOkay, conclusion: pH≈12.62, so the answer is \\boxed{12.62}\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe pH of the solution is \\boxed{12.62}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743813561, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3934, prompt_tokens=550, total_tokens=4484, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 The reaction would be:

OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O

But there's only a small amount of CH3COOH (0.05 moles), and the OH- in excess is 0.10 moles. So, in this reaction, OH- will react with all available CH3COOH first: 0.05 moles of OH- would neutralize 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

However, maybe I need to verify this. Wait, first: neutralize H+ from HCl with OH- from Ba(OH)₂:

H+ (0.08) and OH- (0.18). H+ is less than OH-:

0.08 moles H+ + 0.08 moles OH- → 0.08 moles H2O, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles OH-.

But there are acetate ions from CH3COOH. Since we have excess OH-, but acetic acid hasn't dissociated much because of HCl's presence.

Wait, perhaps in solution, the HCl's H+ will push the acetic acid's equilibrium to the left. Thus, CH3COOH remains primarily protonated. However, when mixing a strong base like Ba(OH)2, the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the strong acid, then from the weak acid.

Hmmm, order of neutralization is crucial here. Let me recall: when you have a mixture like this, strong acid and strong base react first. Then, excess strong base can react with weak acid.

So steps:

1. Determine total H+ from HCl and any other sources, but here, CH3COOH's contribution is negligible in presence of HCl.

But actually, in reality, all strong acid H+ is available first, so H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, OH- 0.18 mol.

- 0.08 moles of OH- neutralizes 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl, leaving 0.10 moles of OH-.

Now, the excess OH- can deprotonate CH3COOH since OH- is a strong base. So yes:

moles of CH3COOH: 0.05, moles of OH- remaining: 0.10.

The OH- is in excess. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O

This consumes OH- and CH3COOH in 1:1 ratio. Since CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, we can neutralize that with 0.05 OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

After this, the remaining solution's pH is determined by the concentration of the excess OH-.

Wait, but is this correct? Because when you mix a strong base with a weak acid and strong acid, neutralization occurs in steps:

1. Strong acid (HCl) reacts first with strong base (Ba(OH)2) – each H+ from HCl consumes one OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Then, if there's excess OH-, it will start reacting with the weak acid.

So after step 1: remaining OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol

Step 2: OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

Since CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, OH- (0.10) consumes all CH3COOH (0.05) and leaves 0.05 mol OH-.

Thus, total excess OH- is then 0.05 mol. Then, to find pH, we need to know the concentration of OH- in the final solution.

Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M. Then pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. So pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

Alternatively, that seems high. Let me double-check.

Wait, concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.041666... M. Correct. Then pOH is log(1/[OH]) ?

Yes, pOH = -log10 (0.041666) ≈ 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

But wait, is there anything else I should consider?

For example, after deprotonating all the CH3COOH with OH-, the solution's pH is determined by the excess OH- because it's a strong base. Since we have excess OH- left, the solution's basic, so yes, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 12.62.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculating moles?

Let me summarize:

Total volume = 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL.

HCl: 400 mL * 0.2 M = 80 mmol H+.

Ba(OH)₂: 300 mL * 0.3 M * 2 = 180 mmol OH- (because each Ba(OH)₂ gives 2 OH-).

So HCl contributes 80 mmol H+, Ba(OH)₂ contributes 180 mmol OH-. The H+ from CH3COOH is negligible here because HCl is a strong acid supressing its dissociation.

So first reaction: H+ neutralizes OH-:

80 mmol H+ + 80 mmol OH- → 80 mmol H2O. OH- remaining: 180 - 80 = 100 mmol.

Then, 100 mmol of OH- remaining.

Now, OH- reacts with CH3COOH:

CH3COOH: 500 mL * 0.1 M = 50 mmol.

K for CH3COOH deprotonation with OH- is very large (since OH- is strong base). Therefore, OH- will deprotonate CH3COOH:

OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO- + H2O.

But there are 50 mmol CH3COOH and 100 mmol OH-, so OH- will neutralize 50 mmol CH3COOH to produce 50 mmol CH3COO- and 50 mmol H2O, resulting in OH- remaining: 100 - 50 = 50 mmol.

So 50 mmol OH- in 1200 mL solution.

Concentration of OH- = 50 mmol / 1200 mL = 0.041666... M.

Calculate pOH: -log(0.041666) ≈ 1.38, so pH 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

But let me recheck. Alternatively, another approach might account for possible contributors from the acetate ion.

Wait, the solution after reactions now contains:

- 50 mmol of CH3COO-

- 50 mmol of excess OH-

The other ions:

- The initial HCl's Cl-: 0.08 mol (80 mmol). Neutralized as H+ is gone.

- The initial Ba²+: comes from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 mol (90 mmol), since 300 mL 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 → 0.09 mol Ba²+.

But when Ba(OH)2 dissociates, it gives Ba²+ and 2 OH-. The neutralization by HCl uses OH- but not affects the Ba²+ concentration.

So after reactions, what is the composition?

Major species:

- Ba²+: 0.09 mol (ignoring possible precipitation, but Ba(OH)2 is soluble?)

Wait, actually, I'm a bit hazy. Is Ba(OH)2 completely soluble? Maybe not in concentrated solutions—wait:

Barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it's soluble in water. So Ba²+ and OH- ions are present.

So when neutralizing H+ (from HCl) with OH- from Ba(OH)2, the Ba²+ concentration remains: initially, we have 0.09 mol Ba²+ in 1.2 L.

So [Ba²+] = 0.09 mol /1.2 L = 0.075 M.

No problem, as long as the solution is not supersaturated; since Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, soluble, so this concentration is okay.

The other ions:

Cl-: from HCl 0.08 mol → Let me see, total solution volume 1.2 L, so [Cl⁻] = 0.08 /1.2 ≈ 0.0667 M.

CH3COO-: 50 mmol (0.05 mol) gives [CH3COO⁻] = 0.05 /1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.

But we also have excess OH-: 0.05 mol → [OH-] = 0.05 /1.2 ≈ 0.0417.

So the total solution contains these ions: Ba²+, Cl⁻, CH3COO⁻, and OH-.

But when there's excess OH- in solution and acetate ion, the acetate is a conjugate base of a weak acid but in basic solution, so would there be any acetate reacting?

But OH- is so strong that the presence of CH3COO⁻ likely won't generate more H+; since a strongly basic solution, the acetate ion doesn't undergo hydrolysis (in presence of excess OH-). The pH is determined by excess OH-.

Therefore, the pH comes directly from the [OH-]: 0.0417 M.

So, as before, pH = 14 - (-log(0.0417)) ≈ 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

Alternatively, maybe using more precise log calculation:

[OH-] = 0.041666... M.

Log(0.041666) = log(4.1666×10^-2) = log(4.1666) + log(10^-2) ≈ 0.6198 - 2 ≈ -1.3802.

Therefore, pOH = 1.3802, so pH = 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198 ≈ 12.62.

Seems correct.

But let me verify with another approach.

At the final step, after all neutralizations and reactions, the moles of excess OH- are 0.05 mol in 1.2 L. That's 0.041666 M => pH ≈12.62.

Another check:

The H+ from leftover water: but solution is dominated by excess OH-.

However, to be thorough, verify using equilibrium of water.

If the [OH-] is 0.041666 M, then [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1e-14 / 0.041666 ≈ 2.4e-13, which gives pH = -log(2.4e-13) ≈12.62. That matches.

Alternatively, there’s consideration of ionic strength and activity coefficients, but at this level, it's generally ignored. So the answer should indeed be ~12.62.

Hence, the pH of the solution is approximately 12.62, which rounds to 12.6 or perhaps written with two decimal places. Alternatively, exactly 0.041666 M OH- → pOH = 1.380, pH=12.620, so 12.62. Those might format as 12.6 if two significant figures.

Wait, let's check significant figures. Let's start tracking:

Original concentrations:

CH3COOH: 500 mL (3 sig figs?) The 500 is ambiguous – if it's 500. ± ?

But in most problems, unless stated, maybe copied values with zeros ambiguous, but perhaps given as 0.1 M (2 sig figs), 0.2 M (2), 0.3 M (2). And volumes 500 mL (maybe 3?), but again mixed standards.

Alternatively, sum it up: the moles.

HCl: 0.1 ×0.5 =0.05 mol?  Or volumes. So for HCl, exact 400 mL (0.4 L).

Wait calculation:

HCl: 400mL = 0.4 L; 0.2 M: 0.2 * 0.4 =0.0800 mol. So two significant figures (0.08).

Ba(OH)₂: 300mL=0.3 L; 0.3 M=0.3*0.3=0.09 mol, giving 0.18 mol OH- (two sig figs).

CH3COOH:0.5 L *0.1 M=0.05 mol (two sig figs).

So after mixing:

OH- after neutralizing HCl =0.10 mol (two sig figs). Then neutralizing CH3COOH (0.05) leaves 0.05 mol OH- (two sig figs but that's the tense part??).

But this would depend on consistency... This might incur intermediate steps with exact handling; maybe in the calculation steps, significant figures can be 2 or 3. However, when OH- ends up at 0.042 (two sig figs?), pH may be written with two decimal places such as 12.62, but perhaps we consider the minimal significant figures, which is 2 → so pH 12.62 can be written as 12.6 (properly two decimal places, significant figures).

But as not sure, perhaps he answer is phrased to two decimal places as it's a pH value. Alternatively, if operations, fractions are kept precise, answer may keep three sig figs. The volumes are probably all given to 2 or 3 sig figs. The exact numeric amount at the end has a concentration with two sig figs (0.0417 in my calc) but given that:

H+ from the HCl is 0.08 mol, OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol (twu sig figs), moles are two sig figs. Then, when I reach 0.05 mol excess OH-, which is two significant figures. Volume total is 500+400+300=1200 ml = 1.2 L (two sig figs). Thus, molarity OH- is 0.05 /1.2 = 0.041666.... But with 1.2 L (two sig figs), and 0.05 (one sig fig?), wait:

Wait, No, the 0.05 moles of OH- comes from 0.10 (after HCl neutralization) minus 0.05 (CH3COOH) which is from solving steps. So if 0.10 is two sig figs, and 0.05 is two sig figs (since CH3COOH was given as 0.1 M two sig figs). So 0.05 with two sig figs (scale shifted with decimal), so when subtracted:

0.10 (two) - 0.05 (two)=0.05 (two sig figs), yes. Then the volume is 1.2 L (two sig figs).

Thus when doing 0.05 /1.2 =0.041666..., with two significant figures: [OH-]≈ 0.042 M (two).

Then pOH is -log(0.042) =1.3768. Then pH=12.6232. Often pH is given to two decimal places, which would be 12.62. But if we with a two significant figure precision (from the concentration which is two sig figs), pH is typically given to the number after the decimal: but well, pH has two decimal place digits (unless we have better data consistency). Alternatively, since the concentration is two sig figs (0.042 M), the pOH is 1.38 (rounded), so pH=12.62.

In many textbooks, students are advised not to round intermediate steps. So Correct Answer in two decimal places.

Okay, conclusion: pH≈12.62, so the answer is \boxed{12.62}

**Final Answer**
The pH of the solution is \boxed{12.62}.

However, since OH⁻ is a strong base, it will first consume H+ from the solution, including from HCl, which is completely ionized, and then from the acetic acid. But since after neutralization between H+ (HCl) and OH⁻ (Ba(OH)₂) there is an EXCESS of OH⁻, the question is: will the remaining OH⁻ start deprotonating the acetic acid?\n\nWait a second. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFormally, the steps should be:\n\n1. Neutralize strong acid (HCl) with strong base (Ba(OH)₂). If any excess OH⁻ remains, it will then react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH). Let's go through it methodically.\n\nSo, initial strong acid HCl gives n(H+) = 0.08 mol.\n\nStrong base Ba(OH)₂ gives n(OH⁻) = 0.18 mol.\n\nUpon mixing, they neutralize. The neutralization is H+ (from HCl) + OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) → H2O.\n\nComparing moles:\n\n0.08 H+ ≟ 0.18 OH⁻.\n\nSince moles of H+ < moles of OH⁻, all 0.08 H+ are consumed, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH⁻ excess.\n\nNow, excess OH⁻ can react with acetic acid (a weak acid). Even if acetic acid is weak, OH⁻ is a strong enough base to deprotonate it.\n\nThe reaction would be OH⁻ + CH₃COOH → CH₃COO⁻ + H2O.\n\nThis reaction consumes OH⁻ and CH₃COOH in a 1:1 ratio. Let's calculate. How much CH₃COOH do we have? That's 0.05 mol. Initially, we had 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH and 0.10 mol of OH⁻.\n\nSo, the OH⁻ will react with CH₃COOH, so moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.10, and moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05. The reaction will proceed until either the OH⁻ is consumed or the CH₃COOH is consumed. Since OH⁻ is in greater amount (0.10 vs. 0.05), all of the CH₃COOH will be neutralized, and we will have:\n\nRemaining OH⁻ = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol. Additionally, the CH₃COOH will be entirely converted into CH₃COO⁻ (0.05 mol). However, note that Ba(OH)₂ will contribute Ba²+ ions as well.\n\nAdditionally, let's compute the total volume after mixing, so that concentrations can be calculated. Total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\nBut before determining the final concentration of OH⁻, let's confirm my thinking here. If OH⁻ is in excess even after neutralizing both HCl and CH3COOH, the solution would be strongly basic. However, possibly, there might also be the salt from the neutralization of CH3COOH and Ba(OH)2. Wait, though. Let's structure the entire neutralization process step by step.\n\n1. Mix HCl (H+ and Cl⁻) with Ba(OH)₂ (Ba²+ and OH⁻). The H+ and OH⁻ react first.\n\n   HCl: 0.08 mol H+\n\n   Ba(OH)₂: 0.09 mol Ba²+, 0.18 mol OH⁻\n\n   H+ and OH⁻ neutralize each other, you have 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH⁻ → H2O, leaving 0.10 OH⁻ (since 0.18 OH⁻ - 0.08 = 0.10). So the excess is 0.10 mol OH⁻.\n\nBut, along with this, there are 0.05 mol of CH3COOH.\n\nRecalling that as soon as OH⁻ is present (excess after strong acid-base reaction), it will start reacting with the weak acid. So OH⁻ (strong base) reacts with weak acid (CH3COOH):\n\nCH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H2O\n\nStoichiometrically, you need 1 mole of OH⁻ per 1 mole of CH3COOH.\n\nSo we have 0.05 mol CH3COOH and 0.10 mol OH⁻. All the CH3COOH will be neutralized (as OH⁻ is in excess), leaving:\n\nOH⁻ remaining = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.\n\nBut, in neutralization, every 1 mol of CH3COOH neutralizes 1 mol of OH⁻. So, now, after neutralizing H+ (from HCl) and then neutralizing CH3COOH with the leftover OH⁻, the net OH⁻ left is 0.05 mol.\n\nTherefore, in the final solution, the remaining hydroxide ions are 0.05 mol. Now, we need to take into account the total volume to find the concentration.\n\nMoreover, let's check the other ions as well to ensure there’s no conflict. Let’s list all ions contributed by each compound:\n\nHCl: 0.08 mol H+ and 0.08 mol Cl⁻\n\nBa(OH)₂: 0.09 mol Ba²+ and 0.18 mol OH⁻\n\nCH3COOH: As a weak acid, its contribution to ions is negligible compared to strong acids and bases, but when OH⁻ neutralizes it, it forms 0.05 mol CH3COO⁻ and water.\n\nSo, after all reactions, the solution contains:\n\n- Excess OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂: 0.05 mol\n\n- Cl⁻ from HCl: 0.08 mol\n\n- Ba²+ from Ba(OH)₂: 0.09 mol\n\n- CH3COO⁻ from CH3COOH neutralization: 0.05 mol\n\nOf these, OH⁻ and possibly CH3COO⁻ could affect the pH. However, since OH⁻ is a strong base with 0.05 mol, which is left in excess, this will dictate the pH. Even if CH3COO⁻ is the conjugate base of a weak acid, in the presence of excess OH⁻, which is much stronger, the solution's pH will be determined by the excess OH⁻.\n\nBut here, wait a moment. The final solution's pH is determined by excess OH⁻, so let's compute how much free OH⁻ is left.\n\nWait, but when I neutralize H+, then CH3COOH, the OH⁻ left is 0.05 mol. Then, considering the total volume, let's compute [OH⁻]:\n\nTotal volume V = 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.\n\nn(OH⁻) = 0.05 mol.\n\nSo [OH⁻] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.\n\nThen to find pH, first find pOH = -log[OH⁻] ≈ -log(0.0417)\n\nCalculating log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38 (since log(4.17*10⁻²) ). Hence, pOH ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. Correct? Wait, that's suspicious because 0.0417 M OH⁻ would be lower in pOH, but let's check the math again.\n\nWait, a hydroxide concentration of 0.0417 M. The formula for pOH is -log10([OH⁻])= -log(0.0417). Let me compute accurately:\n\nTake 0.0417. log(4.17*10^-2)= log(4.17) + log(10^-2)= 0.6201 - 2= -1.3799. Therefore, log(0.0417)≈ -1.3799, so pOH= -- -1.3799 → Rather, pOH= - log [OH⁻] = - (-1.62)? Wait, wait, am I mixing up?\n\nWait, pOH= -log10[OH⁻].\n\nIf [OH⁻] is 0.0417 M, then:\n\nWe can write 0.0417 = 4.17 × 10⁻². So the log10(0.0417) = log10(4.17) + log10(10⁻²) ≈ 0.6201 - 2 = -1.3799. Therefore, pOH= -(-1.3799)=1.3799. Approximately 1.38. Thus, pH=14-1.38=12.62.\n\nSo yes, pH≈12.6. However, that seems quite high. Let's crosscheck the steps again to make sure I didn’t skip any nuance.\n\nBut why might no one else have thought this through? Let's proceed step by step:\n\nHCl (strong acid) contributes 0.08 mol H+ ions.\n\nBa(OH)2 (strong base) contributes 0.18 mol OH-.\n\nInitial neutralization: H+ + OH- → H2O; 0.08 mol H+ neutralizes 0.08 mol OH-, excess OH- is 0.10 mol. Then, that OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH: 0.05 mol). So, each mole of CH3COOH will consume 1 mole of OH-, turning into CH3COO- and water.\n\nTherefore, in this step, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol. Therefore, total excess OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L. Thus, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. Hence, pOH ≈ 1.38, pH≈12.62. Seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the presence of 0.05 mol of acetate ions (CH3COO-), which is a weak base, would that affect pH? In a solution where there's excess OH- (strong base), the acetate ion is a weak base and its contribution to pH is negligible compared to excess OH-. Therefore, the solution pH is indeed dictated solely by the excess OH-.\n\nThis makes sense. However, let's cross-verify the molar amounts:\n\nOriginal components:\n\n500 mL CH3COOH 0.1 M: n=0.05\n\n400 mL HCl 0.2 M: n=0.08\n\n300 mL Ba(OH)2 0.3 M: n=0.09 (but since Ba(OH)2 releases 2 OH- per mole, n(OH-)=0.18)\n\nStep 1: HCl + Ba(OH)2:\n\nH+ from HCl: 0.08; OH- from Ba(OH)2:0.18. Reaction proceeds with 0.08 mol H+ neutralized, leaving 0.10; OH- =0.10. Then with 0.05 mol CH3COOH (weak acid), reaction CH3COOH + OH- => CH3COO- + H2O.\n\nThis reaction consumes 0.05 mol OH-, leftover OH-: 0.10 -0.05=0.05 mol.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 =0.041666 ..., ~0.0417 M.\n\nTherefore pH =14 -pOH =14 -(-log(0.0417)).\n\nAs computed, log(0.0417)=log(4.17*10⁻²)= log(4.17) -2. log(4)=0.6021, log(4.17)=approx 0.6201 as before.\n\nSo yes, pOH=-log(0.0417)=1.38. pH=14-1.38=12.62.\n\nBut here's an alternative thought: when you mix strong acid and strong base, you get neutralization. Then if excess OH- remains, so when you have the presence of a weak acid (which is a bit tricky here).\n\nBut wait, after the first neutralization (H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2), excess OH- is present (0.1 mol). This is in the presence of both the weak acid (CH3COOH, 0.05 mol) and water.\n\nHowever, the presence of excess OH⁻ (strong base) will deprotonate the CH3COOH as per the reaction equation: OH⁻ + CH3COOH → CH3COO⁻ + H2O.\n\nSince there is more OH⁻ (0.1 mol) than CH3COOH (0.05 mol), all the CH3COOH is neutralized, converting it to 0.05 mol CH3COO⁻, and the remaining OH⁻ is 0.05 mol. So, effectively, the solution now has 0.05 mol OH⁻ in 1.2 L.\n\nThus, [OH⁻] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈0.0417 M, which is more concentrated than 0.0417 M. So, pOH ~1.38 and pH ~12.62.\n\nAlternatively, let’s compute ion concentrations another way.\n\nTotal solution volume = 500+400+300 mL=1200 mL or 1.2 L.\n\nAfter neutralizing H+ (0.08) and OH- (0.18), followed by reaction with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), we have:\n\nRemaining OH-:0.05 mol. Therefore:\n\n[OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈0.041666 M.\n\nHence, [OH-] ≈4.1666×10⁻² M.\n\nThe pOH is ≈-log(4.1666×10⁻²).\n\nLog(4.1666)=log(100/24)=log(4.1666)= approximately 0.6198.\n\nThus, log(4.1666×10⁻²)=0.6198 -2= -1.3802. Therefore, pOH ≈1.3802.\n\npH=14-pOH=14 -1.3802≈12.62), so 12.62.\n\nBut could there be any interference from the acetate ion? Let’s think. Since we have 0.05 mol of acetate (CH3COO⁻) in solution. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. However, the solution is significantly basic due to the excess hydroxide. The presence of a weak base (acetate) in a solution with a strong base (hydroxide) makes the contribution of the weak base to the pH negligible. The pH will be governed by the concentration of the hydroxide ions. Therefore, it's safe to ignore acetate's contribution here.\n\nAnother point to consider: the presence of non-reactive ions? Let me check all ions in the solution after neutralization steps.\n\nIons in solution after all reactions:\n\nCl⁻: 0.08 mol. This comes from HCl (which dissociated completely). Since Cl⁻ is a spectator ion, it stays in solution.\n\nBa²+: 0.09 mol. Each unit of Ba(OH)₂ contributes one Ba²+. So 0.3 L ×0.3 M=0.09 mol. Barium is just a spectator ion here.\n\nCH3COO⁻: 0.05 mol. From the neutralization of acetic acid with hydroxide.\n\nOH⁻: 0.05 mol. The excess hydroxide left after neutralizing HCl and CH3COOH.\n\nOther ions (H+): only the H+ from the autoionization of water, which is negligible compared to the excess OH⁻. So, the pH is determined by the 0.05 mol OH⁻ in 1.2 L.\n\nTherefore, pH is approximately 12.62.\n\nBut hang on, sometimes in these setups, you have to account for dilution as well when mixing multiple solutions. But wait, we already calculated the moles post-reaction, and to get the concentration, we considered the total volume. So, precisely, the moles are 0.05 mol OH⁻ in 1.2 L.\n\nBut perhaps the error could be in considering how much of CH3COOH was neutralized.\n\nWait, perhaps, in the first time, you mix together 500 mL (0.5 L) of CH3COOH, 400 mL (0.4 L) HCl, and 300 mL (0.3 L) of Ba(OH)2. What happens then?\n\nHCl would dissociate completely into H+ and Cl⁻. Ba(OH)2, being a strong base, would dissociate completely into Ba²+ and OH⁻.\n\nTherefore, when you mix them, all those H+ and OH⁻ ions can combine. So first, as we thought, H+ and OH⁻ neutrally.\n\nBut CH3COOH being a weak acid, will not dissociate much given the common H+ ion from HCl. Indeed, but oh, but wait, in the initial mixing, how are the H+ ions arranged?\n\nWait, HCl is a strong acid; when HCl and CH3COOH are mixed, the high concentration of H+ from HCl will suppress the ionization of CH3COOH (common ion effect). Thus, the amount of H+ contributed by CH3COOH is negligible compared to that by HCl.\n\nThus, total H+ is just the 0.08 mol from HCl. Then, when OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2 is added, it reacts with H+ (from HCl):\n\nH+ + OH⁻ → H2O; this reaction consumes all the H+ (0.08 mol) and OH⁻ (0.08 mol) are consumed, leaving 0.18 -0.08=0.10 OH⁻.\n\nNow, the extra question--after the neutralization between H+ and OH⁻, what's the next step?\n\nWe know that any weak acids (CH3COOH, now in a solution with high pH due to excess OH⁻), the OH⁻ would react with CH3COOH. So that's a neutralization reaction:\n\nCH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H2O.\n\nCH3COOH is available here with 0.05 mol.\n\nWe have 0.10 mol excess OH⁻ so OH⁻ can react equivalently. Therefore, 0.05 moles of OH⁻ will react (because you can't use more OH⁻ than that original 0.05 mol of CH3COOH).\n\nSo, the moles OH⁻ consumed:0.05, remaining OH⁻:0.10 -0.05=0.05.\n\nThus, same result as above. The path is clear.\n\nTherefore, conclusively, the excess hydroxide is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, leading to pOH≈1.38, pH≈12.62. Rounded to two decimal places, probably pH≈12.62, but depending on the level of precision, sometimes it's stated as 12.6 or perhaps using exact logs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps check [OH⁻]=0.05/1.2 exactly. Let's compute 0.05 divided by 1.2.\n\n0.05 /1.2 = (5/100) / (12/10) ) = (5×10)/(100×12)=50/1200=5/120=1/24≈0.0416666...\n\nSo, [OH⁻ ]=1/24 M so lets compute log(1/24): 24=2.4×10^1.\n\nlog(24)=log(2.4×10^1)=log(2.4)+1≈0.3802+1=1.3802. So 1/24 ≈10^-1.3802. So log(1/24)= -1.3802, so pOH=1.3802. Therefore, pH=14-1.3802=12.6198. So roughly 12.62.\n\nThus, the pH is approximately 12.62.\n\nBut to check in case there's an asteroid hit in between steps.\n\nBut why does (optionally) but this problem might challenge if, for instance, we miscalculated the moles. Let's verify again:\n\nEach solution:\n\nCH3COOH:0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol. Correct.\n\nHCl:0.2 M *0.4 L=0.08 mol. Correct.\n\nBa(OH)₂:0.3 M * 0.3 L=0.09 mol. Since each Ba(OH)₂ gives 2 OH⁻, OH- from it is 0.09*2=0.18 mol. Correct.\n\nTotal volume:0.5+0.4+0.3=1.2 L. Correct.\n\nReaction HCl + Ba(OH)₂:\n\nH+ =0.08, OH-=0.18→ H+ neutralizes 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 OH-. Then added 0.05 moles of acetic acid (0.05 mol) is deprotonated by 0.05 OH-.

To determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate moles of each component:**
   - CH₃COOH: \(0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}\)
   - HCl: \(0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}\)
   - Ba(OH)₂: \(0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}\) (which provides \(0.18 \, \text{mol}\) of OH⁻)

2. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - HCl (strong acid) and Ba(OH)₂ (strong base) neutralize each other:
     \[
     \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}
     \]
     - Moles of H⁺ from HCl: 0.08 mol
     - Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18 mol
     - After neutralization: 0.08 mol of H⁺ is neutralized, leaving 0.10 mol of OH⁻.

3. **Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH (weak acid):**
   - OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:
     \[
     \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}
     \]
     - Moles of CH₃COOH: 0.05 mol
     - Excess OH⁻ after neutralization with H⁺: 0.10 mol
     - OH⁻ neutralizes 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH, leaving 0.05 mol of OH⁻.

4. **Calculate the concentration of excess OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of the solution: \(500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}\)
   - Concentration of OH⁻: \(\frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}\)

5. **Calculate pH:**
   - pOH: \(-\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38\)
   - pH: \(14 - 1.38 \approx 12.62\)

The pH of the solution is \boxed{12.62}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Let me think.

CH₃COOH donates an H+ via deprotonation: CH₃COOH ⇌ CH₃COO⁻ + H+.

But when OH⁻ is added, it consumes H+ (Le Chatelier's principle). However, since OH⁻ is a strong base, it will first consume H+ from the solution, including from HCl, which is completely ionized, and then from the acetic acid. But since after neutralization between H+ (HCl) and OH⁻ (Ba(OH)₂) there is an EXCESS of OH⁻, the question is: will the remaining OH⁻ start deprotonating the acetic acid?

Wait a second. Let me approach this step by step.

Formally, the steps should be:

1. Neutralize strong acid (HCl) with strong base (Ba(OH)₂). If any excess OH⁻ remains, it will then react with the weak acid (CH₃COOH). Let's go through it methodically.

So, initial strong acid HCl gives n(H+) = 0.08 mol.

Strong base Ba(OH)₂ gives n(OH⁻) = 0.18 mol.

Upon mixing, they neutralize. The neutralization is H+ (from HCl) + OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂) → H2O.

Comparing moles:

0.08 H+ ≟ 0.18 OH⁻.

Since moles of H+ < moles of OH⁻, all 0.08 H+ are consumed, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH⁻ excess.

Now, excess OH⁻ can react with acetic acid (a weak acid). Even if acetic acid is weak, OH⁻ is a strong enough base to deprotonate it.

The reaction would be OH⁻ + CH₃COOH → CH₃COO⁻ + H2O.

This reaction consumes OH⁻ and CH₃COOH in a 1:1 ratio. Let's calculate. How much CH₃COOH do we have? That's 0.05 mol. Initially, we had 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH and 0.10 mol of OH⁻.

So, the OH⁻ will react with CH₃COOH, so moles of OH⁻ in excess = 0.10, and moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05. The reaction will proceed until either the OH⁻ is consumed or the CH₃COOH is consumed. Since OH⁻ is in greater amount (0.10 vs. 0.05), all of the CH₃COOH will be neutralized, and we will have:

Remaining OH⁻ = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol. Additionally, the CH₃COOH will be entirely converted into CH₃COO⁻ (0.05 mol). However, note that Ba(OH)₂ will contribute Ba²+ ions as well.

Additionally, let's compute the total volume after mixing, so that concentrations can be calculated. Total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

But before determining the final concentration of OH⁻, let's confirm my thinking here. If OH⁻ is in excess even after neutralizing both HCl and CH3COOH, the solution would be strongly basic. However, possibly, there might also be the salt from the neutralization of CH3COOH and Ba(OH)2. Wait, though. Let's structure the entire neutralization process step by step.

1. Mix HCl (H+ and Cl⁻) with Ba(OH)₂ (Ba²+ and OH⁻). The H+ and OH⁻ react first.

   HCl: 0.08 mol H+

   Ba(OH)₂: 0.09 mol Ba²+, 0.18 mol OH⁻

   H+ and OH⁻ neutralize each other, you have 0.08 H+ + 0.08 OH⁻ → H2O, leaving 0.10 OH⁻ (since 0.18 OH⁻ - 0.08 = 0.10). So the excess is 0.10 mol OH⁻.

But, along with this, there are 0.05 mol of CH3COOH.

Recalling that as soon as OH⁻ is present (excess after strong acid-base reaction), it will start reacting with the weak acid. So OH⁻ (strong base) reacts with weak acid (CH3COOH):

CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H2O

Stoichiometrically, you need 1 mole of OH⁻ per 1 mole of CH3COOH.

So we have 0.05 mol CH3COOH and 0.10 mol OH⁻. All the CH3COOH will be neutralized (as OH⁻ is in excess), leaving:

OH⁻ remaining = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

But, in neutralization, every 1 mol of CH3COOH neutralizes 1 mol of OH⁻. So, now, after neutralizing H+ (from HCl) and then neutralizing CH3COOH with the leftover OH⁻, the net OH⁻ left is 0.05 mol.

Therefore, in the final solution, the remaining hydroxide ions are 0.05 mol. Now, we need to take into account the total volume to find the concentration.

Moreover, let's check the other ions as well to ensure there’s no conflict. Let’s list all ions contributed by each compound:

HCl: 0.08 mol H+ and 0.08 mol Cl⁻

Ba(OH)₂: 0.09 mol Ba²+ and 0.18 mol OH⁻

CH3COOH: As a weak acid, its contribution to ions is negligible compared to strong acids and bases, but when OH⁻ neutralizes it, it forms 0.05 mol CH3COO⁻ and water.

So, after all reactions, the solution contains:

- Excess OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂: 0.05 mol

- Cl⁻ from HCl: 0.08 mol

- Ba²+ from Ba(OH)₂: 0.09 mol

- CH3COO⁻ from CH3COOH neutralization: 0.05 mol

Of these, OH⁻ and possibly CH3COO⁻ could affect the pH. However, since OH⁻ is a strong base with 0.05 mol, which is left in excess, this will dictate the pH. Even if CH3COO⁻ is the conjugate base of a weak acid, in the presence of excess OH⁻, which is much stronger, the solution's pH will be determined by the excess OH⁻.

But here, wait a moment. The final solution's pH is determined by excess OH⁻, so let's compute how much free OH⁻ is left.

Wait, but when I neutralize H+, then CH3COOH, the OH⁻ left is 0.05 mol. Then, considering the total volume, let's compute [OH⁻]:

Total volume V = 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

n(OH⁻) = 0.05 mol.

So [OH⁻] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.

Then to find pH, first find pOH = -log[OH⁻] ≈ -log(0.0417)

Calculating log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38 (since log(4.17*10⁻²) ). Hence, pOH ≈ 1.38. Therefore, pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. Correct? Wait, that's suspicious because 0.0417 M OH⁻ would be lower in pOH, but let's check the math again.

Wait, a hydroxide concentration of 0.0417 M. The formula for pOH is -log10([OH⁻])= -log(0.0417). Let me compute accurately:

Take 0.0417. log(4.17*10^-2)= log(4.17) + log(10^-2)= 0.6201 - 2= -1.3799. Therefore, log(0.0417)≈ -1.3799, so pOH= -- -1.3799 → Rather, pOH= - log [OH⁻] = - (-1.62)? Wait, wait, am I mixing up?

Wait, pOH= -log10[OH⁻].

If [OH⁻] is 0.0417 M, then:

We can write 0.0417 = 4.17 × 10⁻². So the log10(0.0417) = log10(4.17) + log10(10⁻²) ≈ 0.6201 - 2 = -1.3799. Therefore, pOH= -(-1.3799)=1.3799. Approximately 1.38. Thus, pH=14-1.38=12.62.

So yes, pH≈12.6. However, that seems quite high. Let's crosscheck the steps again to make sure I didn’t skip any nuance.

But why might no one else have thought this through? Let's proceed step by step:

HCl (strong acid) contributes 0.08 mol H+ ions.

Ba(OH)2 (strong base) contributes 0.18 mol OH-.

Initial neutralization: H+ + OH- → H2O; 0.08 mol H+ neutralizes 0.08 mol OH-, excess OH- is 0.10 mol. Then, that OH- will react with the weak acid (CH3COOH: 0.05 mol). So, each mole of CH3COOH will consume 1 mole of OH-, turning into CH3COO- and water.

Therefore, in this step, remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol. Therefore, total excess OH- is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L. Thus, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0417 M. Hence, pOH ≈ 1.38, pH≈12.62. Seems correct.

But wait, in the presence of 0.05 mol of acetate ions (CH3COO-), which is a weak base, would that affect pH? In a solution where there's excess OH- (strong base), the acetate ion is a weak base and its contribution to pH is negligible compared to excess OH-. Therefore, the solution pH is indeed dictated solely by the excess OH-.

This makes sense. However, let's cross-verify the molar amounts:

Original components:

500 mL CH3COOH 0.1 M: n=0.05

400 mL HCl 0.2 M: n=0.08

300 mL Ba(OH)2 0.3 M: n=0.09 (but since Ba(OH)2 releases 2 OH- per mole, n(OH-)=0.18)

Step 1: HCl + Ba(OH)2:

H+ from HCl: 0.08; OH- from Ba(OH)2:0.18. Reaction proceeds with 0.08 mol H+ neutralized, leaving 0.10; OH- =0.10. Then with 0.05 mol CH3COOH (weak acid), reaction CH3COOH + OH- => CH3COO- + H2O.

This reaction consumes 0.05 mol OH-, leftover OH-: 0.10 -0.05=0.05 mol.

Therefore, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 =0.041666 ..., ~0.0417 M.

Therefore pH =14 -pOH =14 -(-log(0.0417)).

As computed, log(0.0417)=log(4.17*10⁻²)= log(4.17) -2. log(4)=0.6021, log(4.17)=approx 0.6201 as before.

So yes, pOH=-log(0.0417)=1.38. pH=14-1.38=12.62.

But here's an alternative thought: when you mix strong acid and strong base, you get neutralization. Then if excess OH- remains, so when you have the presence of a weak acid (which is a bit tricky here).

But wait, after the first neutralization (H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2), excess OH- is present (0.1 mol). This is in the presence of both the weak acid (CH3COOH, 0.05 mol) and water.

However, the presence of excess OH⁻ (strong base) will deprotonate the CH3COOH as per the reaction equation: OH⁻ + CH3COOH → CH3COO⁻ + H2O.

Since there is more OH⁻ (0.1 mol) than CH3COOH (0.05 mol), all the CH3COOH is neutralized, converting it to 0.05 mol CH3COO⁻, and the remaining OH⁻ is 0.05 mol. So, effectively, the solution now has 0.05 mol OH⁻ in 1.2 L.

Thus, [OH⁻] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈0.0417 M, which is more concentrated than 0.0417 M. So, pOH ~1.38 and pH ~12.62.

Alternatively, let’s compute ion concentrations another way.

Total solution volume = 500+400+300 mL=1200 mL or 1.2 L.

After neutralizing H+ (0.08) and OH- (0.18), followed by reaction with CH3COOH (0.05 moles), we have:

Remaining OH-:0.05 mol. Therefore:

[OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈0.041666 M.

Hence, [OH-] ≈4.1666×10⁻² M.

The pOH is ≈-log(4.1666×10⁻²).

Log(4.1666)=log(100/24)=log(4.1666)= approximately 0.6198.

Thus, log(4.1666×10⁻²)=0.6198 -2= -1.3802. Therefore, pOH ≈1.3802.

pH=14-pOH=14 -1.3802≈12.62), so 12.62.

But could there be any interference from the acetate ion? Let’s think. Since we have 0.05 mol of acetate (CH3COO⁻) in solution. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid. However, the solution is significantly basic due to the excess hydroxide. The presence of a weak base (acetate) in a solution with a strong base (hydroxide) makes the contribution of the weak base to the pH negligible. The pH will be governed by the concentration of the hydroxide ions. Therefore, it's safe to ignore acetate's contribution here.

Another point to consider: the presence of non-reactive ions? Let me check all ions in the solution after neutralization steps.

Ions in solution after all reactions:

Cl⁻: 0.08 mol. This comes from HCl (which dissociated completely). Since Cl⁻ is a spectator ion, it stays in solution.

Ba²+: 0.09 mol. Each unit of Ba(OH)₂ contributes one Ba²+. So 0.3 L ×0.3 M=0.09 mol. Barium is just a spectator ion here.

CH3COO⁻: 0.05 mol. From the neutralization of acetic acid with hydroxide.

OH⁻: 0.05 mol. The excess hydroxide left after neutralizing HCl and CH3COOH.

Other ions (H+): only the H+ from the autoionization of water, which is negligible compared to the excess OH⁻. So, the pH is determined by the 0.05 mol OH⁻ in 1.2 L.

Therefore, pH is approximately 12.62.

But hang on, sometimes in these setups, you have to account for dilution as well when mixing multiple solutions. But wait, we already calculated the moles post-reaction, and to get the concentration, we considered the total volume. So, precisely, the moles are 0.05 mol OH⁻ in 1.2 L.

But perhaps the error could be in considering how much of CH3COOH was neutralized.

Wait, perhaps, in the first time, you mix together 500 mL (0.5 L) of CH3COOH, 400 mL (0.4 L) HCl, and 300 mL (0.3 L) of Ba(OH)2. What happens then?

HCl would dissociate completely into H+ and Cl⁻. Ba(OH)2, being a strong base, would dissociate completely into Ba²+ and OH⁻.

Therefore, when you mix them, all those H+ and OH⁻ ions can combine. So first, as we thought, H+ and OH⁻ neutrally.

But CH3COOH being a weak acid, will not dissociate much given the common H+ ion from HCl. Indeed, but oh, but wait, in the initial mixing, how are the H+ ions arranged?

Wait, HCl is a strong acid; when HCl and CH3COOH are mixed, the high concentration of H+ from HCl will suppress the ionization of CH3COOH (common ion effect). Thus, the amount of H+ contributed by CH3COOH is negligible compared to that by HCl.

Thus, total H+ is just the 0.08 mol from HCl. Then, when OH⁻ from Ba(OH)2 is added, it reacts with H+ (from HCl):

H+ + OH⁻ → H2O; this reaction consumes all the H+ (0.08 mol) and OH⁻ (0.08 mol) are consumed, leaving 0.18 -0.08=0.10 OH⁻.

Now, the extra question--after the neutralization between H+ and OH⁻, what's the next step?

We know that any weak acids (CH3COOH, now in a solution with high pH due to excess OH⁻), the OH⁻ would react with CH3COOH. So that's a neutralization reaction:

CH3COOH + OH⁻ → CH3COO⁻ + H2O.

CH3COOH is available here with 0.05 mol.

We have 0.10 mol excess OH⁻ so OH⁻ can react equivalently. Therefore, 0.05 moles of OH⁻ will react (because you can't use more OH⁻ than that original 0.05 mol of CH3COOH).

So, the moles OH⁻ consumed:0.05, remaining OH⁻:0.10 -0.05=0.05.

Thus, same result as above. The path is clear.

Therefore, conclusively, the excess hydroxide is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, leading to pOH≈1.38, pH≈12.62. Rounded to two decimal places, probably pH≈12.62, but depending on the level of precision, sometimes it's stated as 12.6 or perhaps using exact logs.

Alternatively, perhaps check [OH⁻]=0.05/1.2 exactly. Let's compute 0.05 divided by 1.2.

0.05 /1.2 = (5/100) / (12/10) ) = (5×10)/(100×12)=50/1200=5/120=1/24≈0.0416666...

So, [OH⁻ ]=1/24 M so lets compute log(1/24): 24=2.4×10^1.

log(24)=log(2.4×10^1)=log(2.4)+1≈0.3802+1=1.3802. So 1/24 ≈10^-1.3802. So log(1/24)= -1.3802, so pOH=1.3802. Therefore, pH=14-1.3802=12.6198. So roughly 12.62.

Thus, the pH is approximately 12.62.

But to check in case there's an asteroid hit in between steps.

But why does (optionally) but this problem might challenge if, for instance, we miscalculated the moles. Let's verify again:

Each solution:

CH3COOH:0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol. Correct.

HCl:0.2 M *0.4 L=0.08 mol. Correct.

Ba(OH)₂:0.3 M * 0.3 L=0.09 mol. Since each Ba(OH)₂ gives 2 OH⁻, OH- from it is 0.09*2=0.18 mol. Correct.

Total volume:0.5+0.4+0.3=1.2 L. Correct.

Reaction HCl + Ba(OH)₂:

H+ =0.08, OH-=0.18→ H+ neutralizes 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.10 OH-. Then added 0.05 moles of acetic acid (0.05 mol) is deprotonated by 0.05 OH-. Remaining OH-:0.10-0.05=0.05 mol.

Translate into concentration:0.05 mol in 1.2 L= ~0.04167 M. Henc, pOH≈1.38, pH≈12.62.

Alternatively, will this pH change because somehow the acetate could react?

Wait, once we have CH3COO- (0.05 mol) and excess OH- (0.05 mol) in the solution, will there be any reaction between CH3COO- and OH-? However, since CH3COO- is a base and OH- is a stronger base, but since they are both in solution, there is no driving force for reaction. So the only contribution to pH would still be from OH-.

Yes, only the excess OH- defines the pH. The acetate would have some basic properties, but in the presence of excess OH-, it's like adding acetate to strong base solution. The acetate's effect is negligible. So it would not contribute to pH here.

Hence, all steps are sound.

Therefore, 12.62 makes sense.

Wait, but why did I get confused when the acetic acid's potential deprotonation might contribute? But perhaps acetic acid can only give H+ once, which is then neutralized by OH-.

To be precise, the neutralization steps:

1. Strong acid HCl neutralizes strong base Ba(OH)₂ until one or the other is consumed. Since we have more OH-, H+ is consumed entirely, OH- remaining.

2. Any remaining OH- will react with weak acid (CH3COOH) until either the OH- is consumed or the weak acid is fully deprotonated. In this case, since more OH- than CH3COOH moles, CH3COOH is fully neutralized, but OH- remains.

Third, the presence of acetate ions (CH3COO⁻) might cause some buffer action, but in the presence of excess OH⁻, the solution will act as a strong base solution.

If you have excess OH⁻, then the solution is strongly basic, and the presence of CH3COO⁻ just gives a negligible contribution to pH through its hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of CH3COO⁻ in water is:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH⁻.

However, if there is already excess OH⁻ present, this equilibrium is driven to the left (Le Chatelier). Therefore, the contribution from acetate’s hydrolysis is negligible compared to the already high concentration of OH⁻.

Thus, we don't need to consider it. So the pH is solely due to the excess hydroxide.

Therefore, pH≈12.62. Hence, the answer is approximately that.

But unless I have a new insight, this is the final analysis.

**Final Answer**
The pH of the solution is \boxed{12.62}.
