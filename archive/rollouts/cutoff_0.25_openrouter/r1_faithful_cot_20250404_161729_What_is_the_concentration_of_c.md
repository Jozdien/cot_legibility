To determine the concentration of calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex at 25 °C with a stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \):

1. **Dissociation Reaction**: The Ca-EDTA complex dissociates as:
   \[
   \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
   \]

2. **Stability Constant Expression**:
   \[
   K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
   \]
   Given the stability constant \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \).

3. **Equilibrium Concentrations**:
   - Let the concentration of Ca²⁺ at equilibrium be \( x \).
   - Since the dissociation is minimal, \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \) M.
   - Both \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] \) and \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] \) are \( x \).

4. **Substitute into the Stability Constant**:
   \[
   5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}
   \]

6. **Result**:
   The concentration of calcium ions is \(\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7}\text{ M}}\).

Okay, so I have to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) given is 5x10^10. Hmm... let me think.

First, I remember that EDTA forms stable complexes with metal ions like calcium. The term "stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex" probably means that all the calcium and EDTA are in the complex form, right? But since the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions, Ca²⁺, I need to consider the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.

The stability constant, K, is really large here (5x10^10), which suggests that the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²⁺ should be very low. But how do I calculate it precisely?

Let me recall the formula for the stability constant. The stability constant (K) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and EDTA. The reaction is:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

And the stability constant K is given by:

K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

Since the pH is ideal, I don't have to worry about the protonation states of EDTA; at ideal pH (which is usually around pH 10 for EDTA to be in its fully deprotonated form, EDTA⁴⁻), EDTA exists as the Y⁴⁻ ion (EDTA⁴⁻ is sometimes written as Y⁴⁻). So that simplifies things.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, before dissociation, [Ca-EDTA²⁻] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²⁺] and [EDTA⁴⁻] are zero. Then, some tiny amount of the complex will dissociate into Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Let me denote the concentration of Ca²⁺ as x. Then, at equilibrium:

[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x will be negligible compared to 0.02)

And [Ca²⁺] = x

[EDTA⁴⁻] = x (since they dissociate 1:1)

Plugging this into the K expression:

K = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

We know K is 5x10^10, so:

5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

We can solve for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13

Wait, let's compute that again:

0.02 divided by 5x10^10 --> 0.02 is 2x10^-2

So, 2x10^-2 / 5x10^10 = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13

Therefore, x² = 4x10^-13, so x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5

But wait, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(10^-13) is 10^-6.5, which is 10^-6 times 10^-0.5 = 10^-6 * (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 10^-6 * 0.3162

So, x ≈ 2 * 0.3162 x10^-6 ≈ 0.6324 x10^-6 M ≈ 6.324x10^-7 M

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute this as sqrt(4x10^-13). Let me think: sqrt(4x10^-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2*(1e-6.5), and 1e-6.5 is 1e-6 * 1e-0.5 which is approximately 3.162e-7, so 2*3.162e-7 ≈6.324e-8 M? Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, 10^-13 is (10^-6.5)^2. Let me verify:

10^-6.5 = 10^(-6 - 0.5) = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 ≈ 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-7, so squared gives (3.162e-7)^2 ≈ 1e-13.

Wait, but in the calculation above, the 4*1e-13 is under the square root: sqrt(4 * 1e-13) is 2 * sqrt(1e-13) = 2*1e-6.5 ≈ 2*3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M, which is 6.32x10^-7 M. So about 6.32e-7 M for [Ca²+] and [EDTA⁴⁻]. That's 6.32x10^-7 M.

But let me double-check.

Given K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA])

Assuming that [Ca-EDTA] ≈ 0.02, since dissociation is minimal.

Therefore,

[Ca²+] = sqrt( [Ca-EDTA]/(K) ) = sqrt(0.02 /5e10 )

0.02 = 2e-2

So, 2e-2 / 5e10 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5

Now, e-6.5 is 1e-6.5 which is the same as 10^(-6.5) which is approximately 3.162e-7, as before. Then 2 * 3.162e-7 is 6.324e-7. So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M.

Alternatively, express 6.32x10^-7 as 6.3e-7 M? Not sure if exact or approximate, but since K is given as 5e10, so precise calculation?

Wait another approach:

If x = [Ca²+] = [EDTA⁴⁻], then substitute into K:

K = (0.02) / (x^2)

So x^2 = 0.02 / K

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

Then x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Calculating 10^(-6.5):

Calculate 10^0.5 = sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623, so 10^-0.5 ≈ 0.31623

Therefore, 10^-6.5 = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 ≈ 1e-6 * 0.31623 = 3.1623e-7

Thus, x ≈ 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈6.3245e-7 M. So approximately 6.32 x10^-7 M.

Expressed in scientific notation, that’s 6.3e-7, but maybe we need to write it as 6.3x10^-7 M.

Alternatively, if we calculate exact:

Taking logarithms.

Alternatively, since X is 2e-6.5:

The exponent 6.5 is 13/2, so 10^(-6.5) = 10^-(13/2) = (10^-13)^(1/2). But as a decimal, yes, 10^-6.5 ≈3.162e-7 as above.

But maybe write the answer as 2 x 10^-6.5, but that's not a common form, so decimal exponent could be converted to 3.16e-7, times 2 is 6.32e-7.

Therefore, 6.3e-7 or 6.32e-7 is the concentration.

Alternatively, in more simple terms:

Since K is so big, and the initial concentration of complex is 0.02 M, the approximation that x << 0.02 is valid. Therefore, assuming that the [Ca-EDTA] remains ~0.02 M is a valid assumption, which allows us to proceed with the calculation.

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in solution is approximately 6.3 x10^-7 M. Wait, but maybe in significant figures. The given K is 5e10 (one significant figure?) and 0.02 M (one significant figure... Wait, 0.02 is two decimal places, but leading zeros don't count. So in 0.02, there's one significant figure? Wait, if it's written as 0.02, the significant figures are the '2', so that's one? Or if it's given as 0.02, then there's two? Wait, 0.02 – unless there's a decimal after the second zero, like 0.020, that would be two, but here it's 0.02. Some might say it's two significant figures if the writer specified it as two, but if written as 0.02, probably one or two?

Hmm, this is one of those ambiguities. Actually, in many cases, 0.02 would have one significant figure, as leading zeros are not significant, and the two zeros after the decimal are just place holders. So, the value is known to one significant figure (the 2). Similarly, 5x10^10 is one significant figure.

So when multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise. So, with two numbers each with 1 sig fig, the answer would have 1 sig fig. So, instead of 6.32e-7, which is about 6e-7? But wait the full answer is roughly 6.32e-7. If we need to write with one significant figure, 6e-7.

But the question is given from a problem. Let me look back. The problem says "0.02 M", which could be 1 or 2 sig figs. However, in many cases, decimal points with leading zeros, the significant figures start at the first non-zero digit. Hence, 0.02 would be one significant figure. The K is given as 5x10^10, which is one significant figure.

Therefore, with calculations, we have two numbers with one sig fig. Therefore, the answer here should be reported to one significant figure, which would be 6 x 10^-7 M.

But computing the exact value is approximately 6.32 x10^-7, which would round to 6e-7.

But some sources might consider 0.02 as two sig figs. For example, if you write 0.02, and the notation in some places allows that. However, if the original problem has 0.02 M, written as 0.02 instead of 0.020, probably the intended answer is to take one or two. Hmm.

Given that it's a stoichiometric concentration, and the pH is ideal, perhaps they consider that 0.02 is precise. But, since both K and concentration have one significant figure, standard practice would have the answer with one.

However, in the detailed calculation, without considering sig figs, it is ≈6.32e-7, so maybe the answer expects more precise, but given the input data, better to write with scientific notation with one sig fig, so 6e-7 M. Wait, but perhaps that's being too pedantic, maybe they just want the exact answer in terms of the calculation, not taking into account the sig figs. Alternatively, in the literature, often stability constants can have two significant figures, and concentrations might be given with two. However, unless specified.

Alternatively, probably expected to do the calculation exactly and write the answer as sqrt(4e-13) =2e-6.5 which is 6.32e-7. But we can give that as 6.3 x10^-7 M. But knowing that in the original steps, since there are two sig figs in 0.02 (maybe), let's check.

If 0.02 M is two sig figs, then "0.02" – but trailing zeros after the decimal count as significant. Wait, 0.02, the 2 is after the decimal but the zeros before it are not. So, 0.02 is 1 sig fig because only the 2 is significant. If it were written as 0.020, that's two sig figs. So in this case, 0.02 is one sig fig. Hence, both K and conc are one sig fig. Then the answer is 6e-7. If I had another source that 0.02 is two, but maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is abstract and you should compute an exact answer regardless. Hmm. If I consider possible answer without significant figure adjustment, as 6.32 x10^-7.

Alternatively, another approach. Assume that under ideal pH (which I think is around 10), EDTA is fully deprotonated. So don't have to worry about that. Since K is 5e10. So yea, based on the Ca-EDTA complex dissociation. Calculate the concentration as sqrt(0.02 /5e10 )

No, probably that's my answer.

But let me just check if there's another approach. For example, some problems involving EDTA complexes can be approached through considering that at excess EDTA, metal ion concentration is given by 1/K * the total concentration. But in this case the solution is just the complex, at 0.02 M.

So here, dissociation is Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

The solubility is governed by K_dissociation = 1/K_formation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Then, if the dissociation is x, so you can model it via:

K_d = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]/[Ca-EDTA] = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) = ~ x² /0.02 =1/K => 5e10 is K, so Kd is1/5e10= 2e-11.

Thus, x²=0.02*Kd=0.02*2e-11=4e-13 =>x=2e-6.5= 6.324e-7 M. So same as before.

Therefore, again confirming the same answer. So the free Ca²+ concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7}\text{ M}}.

But given significant figures from K and concentration, if forced to 1 sig fig, then 6e-7. But as in many problems, they may prefer exactly as comes. So maybe write 6.3e-7. Checking the problem again though:

Numerical Values: K is 5x10^10 to 1 sig fig and 0.02 to potentially 1 or 2. But 0.02 is two decimal places but ambiguous on sig figs. The temperature is given as 25°C, which typically isn't counted. The question just asks for the concentration. So perhaps it's safest to present one of √(0.02/(5*10^10)) in terms of: the exact value. Let's compute 0.02/(5*10^10) = 0.004*10^-10 = 4*10^-13

Then √(4*10^-13) = 2*10^(-6.5) but convert 10^-6.5 to 3.16*10^-7, as done earlier.

So 2 * 3.16*10^-7 =6.32*10^-7 → 6.32e-7. So to two decimal points, but since K was only one sig fig, perhaps we should limit to one. However, in reality, in journal articles it's common to take more, but in exams if they say make it to 1 or 2, perhaps here using two isn't wrong. If hard-pressed, perhaps we are okay with 6.3x10^-7 M.

Otherwise, the other thing is check textbook examples. But without further info,  Given that original numbers are one and potentially two sig figs, but 0.02 might not be.

Alternatively, since I think 0.02 and 5E10 are gives as exact values, maybe treating them as exact and taking answers.

Actually, in the context of the question, the primary work is knowing that [Ca²+] equals sqrt([Ca-EDTA]/K). By applying that, the rest is calculation. So given that, the result is 2 x 10^{-6.5}, which is 6.32...x10^{-7}. So \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7}\text{ M}} is appropriate.

Alternatively, if they want to express in the answer standard, they might write 6.3 x10⁻⁷ M.

Another check: Since K = 5e10, that is extremely large. So even at 0.02 M complex, the amount of free Ca²+ is extremely small, which aligns with that x is approximately the square root of (0.02/5e10) as earlier. Getting ~6e-7 makes sense.

Yeah, so final answer is 6.3e-7 M. Thus, boxing it.


**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7}\text{ M}}.

Okay, so I have to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) given is 5x10^10. Hmm... let me think.

[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x will be negligible compared to 0.02)

And [Ca²⁺] = x

[EDTA⁴⁻] = x (since they dissociate 1:1)

Plugging this into the K expression:

K = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

We know K is 5x10^10, so:

5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

We can solve for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13

Wait, let's compute that again:

0.02 divided by 5x10^10 --> 0.02 is 2x10^-2

So, 2x10^-2 / 5x10^10 = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13

Therefore, x² = 4x10^-13, so x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5

But wait, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(10^-13) is 10^-6.5, which is 10^-6 times 10^-0.5 = 10^-6 * (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 10^-6 * 0.3162

So, x ≈ 2 * 0.3162 x10^-6 ≈ 0.6324 x10^-6 M ≈ 6.324x10^-7 M

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute this as sqrt(4x10^-13). Let me think: sqrt(4x10^-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2*(1e-6.5), and 1e-6.5 is 1e-6 * 1e-0.5 which is approximately 3.162e-7, so 2*3.162e-7 ≈6.324e-8 M? Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, 10^-13 is (10^-6.5)^2. Let me verify:

10^-6.5 = 10^(-6 - 0.5) = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 ≈ 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-7, so squared gives (3.162e-7)^2 ≈ 1e-13.

Wait, but in the calculation above, the 4*1e-13 is under the square root: sqrt(4 * 1e-13) is 2 * sqrt(1e-13) = 2*1e-6.5 ≈ 2*3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M, which is 6.32x10^-7 M. So a

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is at an ideal level and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10.

EDTA forms stable complexes with metal ions like calcium. The "stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex" indicates that calcium and EDTA are primarily in the complexed form. However, to find the free calcium ion concentration (Ca²⁺), I need to consider the dissociation of this complex.

With such a large stability constant (5x10^10), the complex is very stable with minimal dissociation, suggesting a very low free Ca²⁺ concentration. Let me calculate this precisely.

The stability constant equation represents the equilibrium for complex formation:
Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

And is expressed as:
K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

At ideal pH (typically around pH 10), EDTA exists fully as EDTA⁴⁻ (sometimes written as Y⁴⁻), which simplifies our calculations.

Initially, the Ca-EDTA complex concentration is 0.02 M, with zero free Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. A small amount of complex will dissociate. If I denote the concentration of Ca²⁺ as x, then at equilibrium:

[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x will be negligible compared to 0.02)
[Ca²⁺] = x
[EDTA⁴⁻] = x (due to 1:1 dissociation)

Substituting into the stability constant expression:
K = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

Since K is 5x10^10:
5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x:
x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13

Taking the square root:
x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5 = 2 * 10^-6.5

Since 10^-6.5 = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 = 10^-6 * (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 10^-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162x10^-7

Therefore, x ≈ 2 * 3.162x10^-7 ≈ 6.324x10^-7 M

# OpenAI completion

Alright, so I need to determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The conditions are an ideal pH and a temperature of 25°C, with a given stability constant (KCa-EDTA) of 5x10^10. Let me think this through.

EDTA forms stable complexes with metal ions like calcium. When we talk about a "stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex," it likely means that all calcium and EDTA are present as the complex. However, since the task is to find the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺), we need to account for the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex.

Given the large stability constant (5x10^10), the complex is very stable, implying minimal dissociation and therefore a low concentration of free Ca²⁺. But how to calculate this exactly?

The stability constant (K) represents the equilibrium constant for forming the complex from the metal ion and EDTA. The reaction is:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

The expression for the stability constant K is:

K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

Because the pH is ideal, we don't worry about EDTA's protonation states, assuming it exists as the Y⁴⁻ ion (fully deprotonated). This simplifies the scenario.

Initially, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, meaning [Ca-EDTA²⁻] is 0.02 M, while both [Ca²⁺] and [EDTA⁴⁻] are zero. Some of the complex will dissociate, creating small amounts of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Let's denote the concentration of Ca²⁺ as x. At equilibrium:

[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (x is negligible due to the large K)

Thus, [Ca²⁺] = x and [EDTA⁴⁻] = x (dissociates 1:1)

Substituting into the K expression:

K = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

Given K = 5x10^10:

5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13

Reassessing the calculation:

0.02 divided by 5x10^10 → 0.02 equals 2x10^-2

Thus, 2x10^-2 / 5x10^10 = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13

Therefore, x² = 4x10^-13, and x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5

Also, sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(10^-13) is 10^-6.5, which translates to 10^-6 times 10^-0.5 ≈ 10^-6 * 0.3162

So, x ≈ 2 * 0.3162 x10^-6 ≈ 0.6324 x10^-6 M ≈ 6.324x10^-7 M

Alternatively, computing sqrt(4x10^-13): sqrt(4x10^-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2*(1e-6.5); 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.162e-7. Hence, 2*3.162e-7 ≈ 6.324e-7 M. 

Examining, 10^-13 is essentially (10^-6.5)^2:

10^-6.5 = 10^(-6 - 0.5) = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 ≈ 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-7, squaring gives approximately 1e-13.

Hence, under the square root: sqrt(4 * 1e-13) results in 2 * sqrt(1e-13) = 2*1e-6.5 ≈ 2*3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M, which equals 6.32x10^-7 M.

To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation of the complex:

\[ \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \]

The stability constant \( K \) for this reaction is given by:

\[ K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} \]

Given \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \) and the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation \( x \) is very small compared to 0.02 M. Therefore, at equilibrium:

- \([\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02\) M
- \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\)
- \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\)

Substituting these into the stability constant expression:

\[ 5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13} \]

\[ x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M} \]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is:

\[ \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}} \]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 bit more precise would be 6.32e-7 M.

But let me check the math again because sometimes exponents can trip you up.

Start with x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10)

Converting 0.02 to scientific notation, that's 2 x 10^-2.

Thus:

x² = (2 x 10^-2) / (5 x10^10) = (2/5) x10^(-2-10) )= 0.4 x10^-12 = 4 x10^-13

So, x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5

Wait 10^-6.5 is the same as 10^(-6 + 0.5) ?

Wait, no: 10^-6.5 = 10^-(6.5)=10^-(6 +0.5)=10^-6 *10^-0.5

But 10^-0.5 is 1/sqrt(10) ≈0.316

Therefore, x=2*10^-6.5 ≈ 2*0.316*10^-6 ≈ 0.632*10^-6, which is 6.32*10^-7 M

Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈6.32e-7 M.

So that's approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. To check, plugging back into K:

K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA])

So K=0.02/( (6.32e-7)^2 )

Calculating denominator: (6.32e-7)^2 ≈ (6.32)^2 x10^-14 ≈ 39.9 x10^-14≈ 4x10^-13

So denominator is 4x10^-13

Then 0.02/(4x10^-13 )= (2x10^-2)/(4x10^-13) = 0.5x10^11=5x10^10. That matches the given K, so the calculation seems correct.

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3x10^-7 M. Since the problem states "0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA", then the answer is approx 6.3x10^-7 M.

Wait, but maybe we need to write it in scientific notation with one significant figure? Wait, the given K is 5x10^10 which is one significant figure? But 0.02 M has two significant figures. Maybe the answer should have two sig figs?

The problem says 0.02 M (which is two significant figures) and K=5x10^10 (which is one significant figure). So when multiplying/dividing, the number with the least sig figs determines the result. Since K has one sig fig, but wait, the problem says "5x10^10"; it's not clear if it's one or two (if 5.0x10^10 then two sig figs). But written as 5x10^10, generally considered as one.

But the problem is from a source, might not be strict on sig figs. But maybe the answer expects two sig figs because 0.02 is two? Hmmm, it's a bit ambiguous.

But following strict sig fig rules, since K is 1 sig fig and 0.02 is two sig figs, the answer should be 6x10^-7 M (one sig fig), as K is 5x10^10 (one sig fig) seems likely. Wait, but 6.32 rounds to 6.3 if two, or 6 if one. Hmm. But just to check, original K is given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), the 0.02 M (probably two). When you have both quantities in your calculation, so although 0.02 is two, if one of the values is one sig fig, the result should have one. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. Wait, but in some cases, the leading digit may not be precise, but in our case, the exact answer would depend on exact values.

Alternatively, maybe the problem just wants the exact answer from the calculation regardless of sig figs. Since our calculation yields approximately 6.32x10^-7, perhaps write 6.3x10^-7. But since it's an extremely high K, and assuming x << 0.02, maybe 6.3x10^-7 is acceptable. Also, 5x10^10 is given, which could be considered a precise value in some contexts (like as a constant). Hmm. But since the answer is for a box, perhaps we just need to present it as \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in assumptions. Let's check equations again.

We assumed that the dissociation results in [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, but since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, the total EDTA is 0.02 M. When the complex dissociates,

At equilibrium,

[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈0.02

[Ca²⁺] = x

[EDTA⁴⁻] = x

Yes, because EDTA⁴⁻ is only coming from the dissociation of Ca-EDTA, so unless there's other sources.

Thus substituting into the K expression is correct.

Another way, perhaps consider that the concentration of EDTA in solution is all in the complex form except for a tiny x. So same as I did. Thus, it's correct.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. Which is 6.3e-7 M.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA solution at pH 10 and 25°C can be determined using the stability constant (K = 5×10¹⁰). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Assuming negligible dissociation of the complex (\( [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \)), and letting \( x = [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] \):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \implies x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13} \implies x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

**Answer:** \(\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}}\)

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning



That would mean the concentration of Ca²⁺ is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check the math.

Calculating x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 0.02 / 5 / 1e10 = 0.004 / 1e10 = 4e-13
Thus x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = approx 6.32e-7 as before. So, okay.

Wait another thing: When dealing with such a high stability constant, how accurate is assuming that x is negligible? Let's see. If 0.02 M complex dissociates by approximately 6e-7 M, then the change in the complex's concentration is 0.02 - 6e-7 ≈ 0.01999994, which almost rounds up to 0.02. So our initial approximation was valid. Hence, the calculated x is accurate.

Therefore, the free calcium ion concentration [Ca²⁺] is around 6.3x10^-7 M.

Let\'s convert that to scientific notation properly:\n\n6.32e-7 M is 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.\n\nBut let\'s check the calculation once again to prevent any mistakes.\n\nGiven:\n\nK = 5x10^10\n\nInitial concentration: 0.02 M Ca-EDTA\n\nAssuming dissociation is x, then:\n\nK = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])\n\nK = (0.02 - x)/(x^2) ≈ 0.02/x²,\n\ngiven that x is very small. So,\n\n0.02 = K x² --> x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13\n\nThen, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5\n\nSince 1e-6.5 is 3.162e-7,\n\nSo, 2*3.162e-7 ≈ 6.324e-7, as above.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ is approximately 6.324x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nTherefore, with significant figures considered, given that the K is given as 5x10^10 (one significant figure, but that could be an issue. But in the problem statement, the concentration is given as 0.02 M, which is two significant figures. K is 5x10^10 (arguably one significant figure). Which leads the answer to have one significant figure. However, 0.02, if considered as two sig figs, but sometimes leading zeros are tricky...\n\nWait, 0.02 M is two significant figures (the leading zeros are not significant). The "2" is two digits after the decimal. So 0.02 has one significant figure. So perhaps it\'s better to express the answer with one significant figure? But how does that work.\n\nWait, typically, 0.02 M might be considered to have one significant figure (the \'2\') if the decimal is just a placeholder. If it were written as 2.0e-2, that would be two sig figs. But normally, 0.02 M is one sig fig. Since the problem states 0.02, that would be one sig fig.\n\nBy contrast, the K value: 5e10 is also one significant figure. However, in some contexts, if the problem gives parameters with a certain number of sig figs, but in actual exam settings, given how these problems are often structured, unless concerned with error propagation, you’re sometimes expected to just proceed with the given numbers. So perhaps the answer expects two significant figures if 0.02 is considered two.\n\nBut let me verify.\n\nIn decimal terms: 0.02: zero before decimal is not significant. The two is after the decimal. If written as 0.02, there\'s one significant figure (only the \'2\'). If it\'s written as 0.020, then two significant figures.\n\nTherefore, 0.02 M is one significant figure, and 5x10^10 is one significant figure. Therefore, our answer would have one significant figure. However, in practice, perhaps 6.3e-7 is roughly the answer, but with onesig fig, that\'d be 6e-7 (6x10^-7). Wait, 6.3 is 6.3.. keeping it to onesig fig would be 6x10^-7. But some educators might include two significant figures based on the initial value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question does not enforce significant figures, so express as 6.3x10⁻⁷ M with two significant figures.\n\nWait, let\'s check:\n\nIf we carry out the exact calculation:\n\nx² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/(5)) x 10^(-2-10) = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.162e-7 = 6.324e-7.\n\nSo indeed, 6.32 x10^(-7) M. Which is 6.3 x10^-7 when rounded to two sig figs. However, if 0.02 is just one, then 6e-7. But it\'s a rule of thumb here.\n\nWait actually, the original numbers:\n\n0.02 M (probably 1 sig fig)\n\n5x10^10 (1 sig fig)\n\nSo in the calculation, arithmetic with 1 sig fig: Answer would be 6e-7 M (6x10^-7), but many might report 6.3x10^-7. Hmm. Well, the real aim here is to find the concentration, perhaps in cube but intention isn\'t sig figs so they accept 6.3x10^-7. Alternatively if one is required express exactly then 6.3x10^-7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even exact?\n\nWait standard treatment would be to be cautious given huge K.\n\nCalcium is very tightly bound; the assumption that x << 0.02 is absolutely valid, so the previous steps are correct.\n\nSo, answer is square root of 4e-13. Calculated accurately, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5: 2/(10^6.5) which is 2/(3.16227766e6) ≈ 6.3245553e-7.\n\nSo,[Ca^2+] = 6.32 x10^-7 M, proper significant figures to perhaps two. Possibly, 6.3x10^-7.\n\nYet K₁ is given as 5x10^10; if we are to consider that as one sig fig, then in calculation, the x is sqrt(0.02 / 5x10^10). The square root would have an uncertainty, leading to answer approx 6e-7.\n\nHmm. So let\'s go through once more:\n\nK is given as 5e10 (with one significant figure). Therefore, in the equation x² = 0.02/(5e10). If K was 5.0e10, then three sig figs. It\'s written as 5x10^10, which suggests one.\n\nBut, 0.02 is two decimal places, but it\'s one sig fig. Therefore, x would be [Ca²⁺] is sqrt(0.02 /5x10^10) ≈ sqrt((2e-2)/5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) ≈ 6.3e-7. \n\nBut with one sig fig, 6e-7.\n\nBut perhaps it\'s academic. The answer is around 6.3x10^-7.\n\nSo, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.\n\nIs that what?\n\nAlternatively, maybe integrate in terms of how we write Calcium concentration.\n\nBut wait, Calcium-EDTA usually has a 1:1 complex. The problem states stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, which we interpreted as all calcium and EDTA is in the complex (so no excess). Therefore, my initial assumption was correct.\n\nAdditionally, calculating log K ... 5x10^10 equilibrium.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the given stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is as follows:

\[ \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \]

The stability constant \( K \) is given by:

\[ K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} \]

Since the solution initially contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we assume that the dissociation is minimal due to the large stability constant. Let \( x \) be the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions at equilibrium. Then, the concentrations are approximately:

\[ [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \]
\[ [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x \]
\[ [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \]

Substituting these into the stability constant expression:

\[ 5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} \]
\[ x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13} \]
\[ x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} \]
\[ x = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \]
\[ x \approx 2 \times 3.162 \times 10^{-7} \]
\[ x \approx 6.324 \times 10^{-7} \]

Rounding to two significant figures, the concentration of calcium ions is:

\[ \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{M}} \]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 

So, [Ca²⁺] = ~6.32x10^-7 M? That's approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. Let's convert that to scientific notation properly:

6.32e-7 M is 6.32 x 10⁻⁷ M.

But let's check the calculation once again to prevent any mistakes.

Given:

K = 5x10^10

Initial concentration: 0.02 M Ca-EDTA

Assuming dissociation is x, then:

K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

K = (0.02 - x)/(x^2) ≈ 0.02/x²,

given that x is very small. So,

0.02 = K x² --> x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

Then, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5

Since 1e-6.5 is 3.162e-7,

So, 2*3.162e-7 ≈ 6.324e-7, as above.

Therefore, the equilibrium concentration of Ca²⁺ is approximately 6.324x10⁻⁷ M.

Therefore, with significant figures considered, given that the K is given as 5x10^10 (one significant figure, but that could be an issue. But in the problem statement, the concentration is given as 0.02 M, which is two significant figures. K is 5x10^10 (arguably one significant figure). Which leads the answer to have one significant figure. However, 0.02, if considered as two sig figs, but sometimes leading zeros are tricky...

Wait, 0.02 M is two significant figures (the leading zeros are not significant). The "2" is two digits after the decimal. So 0.02 has one significant figure. So perhaps it's better to express the answer with one significant figure? But how does that work.

Wait, typically, 0.02 M might be considered to have one significant figure (the '2') if the decimal is just a placeholder. If it were written as 2.0e-2, that would be two sig figs. But normally, 0.02 M is one sig fig. Since the problem states 0.02, that would be one sig fig.

By contrast, the K value: 5e10 is also one significant figure. However, in some contexts, if the problem gives parameters with a certain number of sig figs, but in actual exam settings, given how these problems are often structured, unless concerned with error propagation, you’re sometimes expected to just proceed with the given numbers. So perhaps the answer expects two significant figures if 0.02 is considered two.

But let me verify.

In decimal terms: 0.02: zero before decimal is not significant. The two is after the decimal. If written as 0.02, there's one significant figure (only the '2'). If it's written as 0.020, then two significant figures.

Therefore, 0.02 M is one significant figure, and 5x10^10 is one significant figure. Therefore, our answer would have one significant figure. However, in practice, perhaps 6.3e-7 is roughly the answer, but with onesig fig, that'd be 6e-7 (6x10^-7). Wait, 6.3 is 6.3.. keeping it to onesig fig would be 6x10^-7. But some educators might include two significant figures based on the initial value.

Alternatively, maybe the question does not enforce significant figures, so express as 6.3x10⁻⁷ M with two significant figures.

Wait, let's check:

If we carry out the exact calculation:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/(5)) x 10^(-2-10) = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.162e-7 = 6.324e-7.

So indeed, 6.32 x10^(-7) M. Which is 6.3 x10^-7 when rounded to two sig figs. However, if 0.02 is just one, then 6e-7. But it's a rule of thumb here.

Wait actually, the original numbers:

0.02 M (probably 1 sig fig)

5x10^10 (1 sig fig)

So in the calculation, arithmetic with 1 sig fig: Answer would be 6e-7 M (6x10^-7), but many might report 6.3x10^-7. Hmm. Well, the real aim here is to find the concentration, perhaps in cube but intention isn't sig figs so they accept 6.3x10^-7. Alternatively if one is required express exactly then 6.3x10^-7.

Alternatively, maybe even exact?

Wait standard treatment would be to be cautious given huge K.

Calcium is very tightly bound; the assumption that x << 0.02 is absolutely valid, so the previous steps are correct.

So, answer is square root of 4e-13. Calculated accurately, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5: 2/(10^6.5) which is 2/(3.16227766e6) ≈ 6.3245553e-7.

So,[Ca^2+] = 6.32 x10^-7 M, proper significant figures to perhaps two. Possibly, 6.3x10^-7.

Yet K₁ is given as 5x10^10; if we are to consider that as one sig fig, then in calculation, the x is sqrt(0.02 / 5x10^10). The square root would have an uncertainty, leading to answer approx 6e-7.

Hmm. So let's go through once more:

K is given as 5e10 (with one significant figure). Therefore, in the equation x² = 0.02/(5e10). If K was 5.0e10, then three sig figs. It's written as 5x10^10, which suggests one.

But, 0.02 is two decimal places, but it's one sig fig. Therefore, x would be [Ca²⁺] is sqrt(0.02 /5x10^10) ≈ sqrt((2e-2)/5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) ≈ 6.3e-7. 

But with one sig fig, 6e-7.

But perhaps it's academic. The answer is around 6.3x10^-7.

So, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10⁻⁷ M.

Is that what?

Alternatively, maybe integrate in terms of how we write Calcium concentration.

But wait, Calcium-EDTA usually has a 1:1 complex. The problem states stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, which we interpreted as all calcium and EDTA is in the complex (so no excess). Therefore, my initial assumption was correct.

Additionally, calculating log K ... 5x10^10 equilibrium. K = 5e10.

Overall, thoughts correct.

Alternatively, maybe approximate as follows:

Given the log K value. Wait,K could be expressed as log K (base 10). log(5e10) = log(5) + 10 ≈ 0.7 +10 = 10.7. When using EDTA calculations, log K values are typically quoted (stability constants), so if log K = 10.7, and since EDTA is in the Y⁴- form at the proper pH, the concentration can be determined.

Though regardless, calculated via the conventional K. Thus, the answer of approximately 6.3x10^-7 M holds.

Thus, compiling that, adjusting, but seems correct.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{M}}.
