To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), we analyze their respective energies:

1. **Transition Energy (\( \Delta E \))**:
   - The wavelength of the transition is \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).
   - Using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
     \[
     \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - In electronvolts: \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \).

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (Zeeman Energy)**:
   - The energy shift is \( \Delta E_{\text{para}} = \mu_B B m \), where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \), \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m = 1 \):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{para}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1) = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
     \]

3. **Ratio of Energies**:
   - The ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta E_{\text{para}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.09 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
     \]
   - This corresponds to an **order of magnitude difference** of \( 10^{-5} \), meaning the paramagnetic coupling term is **five orders of magnitude smaller** than the transition energy.

**Conclusion**: The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy for a hydrogen atom in a \( 1 \, \text{T} \) magnetic field.

Okay, so I need to compare the order of magnitude between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE in a Hydrogen atom. The given magnetic field is B=1T, parallel to the Oz axis, and the transition corresponds to a wavelength of λ=0.4861 μm. Also, it mentions small values of the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic concepts.

First, the paramagnetic coupling term in the context of a magnetic field probably refers to the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect splits atomic energy levels due to the interaction between the magnetic moment and an external magnetic field. The energy shift due to the paramagnetic (Zeeman) effect is given by ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

On the other hand, the transition energy ΔE is related to the wavelength of the emitted or absorbed photon via the equation ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. The problem wants me to find the ratio of these two energies: ΔE_para / ΔE and determine their orders of magnitude.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate each term separately first and then compare their magnitudes.

Starting with ΔE, the transition energy. The wavelength given is 0.4861 μm, which is in the visible range. Let's convert that to meters: 0.4861 μm = 0.4861 × 10^-6 m. Then, using ΔE = hc/λ.

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s

c = 3.00 × 10^8 m/s

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.00e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m)

Calculating the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.09e-19 J

So ΔE ≈ 4.09 × 10^-19 Joules.

I can also express this in electronvolts since it's a common unit for energy levels in atoms. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. That seems reasonable for a visible wavelength transition in hydrogen, probably part of the Balmer series.

Now, the paramagnetic term. The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T.

Given that B = 1 T and m is small, probably m = 1 (since it's mentioned small m, so maybe ±1 or 0, but for the maximum effect, we can take m=1). However, depending on the transition, m could be changing by ±1 or 0. Wait, but maybe here we just need the magnitude of the Zeeman energy shift compared to the transition energy.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to find the ratio between the Zeeman splitting and the energy of the transition. Then, the question is, for a magnetic field of 1T, how does the Zeeman term compare in magnitude to the transition energy corresponding to 0.4861 micron.

But actually, the exact transition might relate to specific quantum numbers, but the problem doesn't specify the particular transition levels, so maybe they just want a general estimate.

Let's proceed with m=1 for the paramagnetic term.

So, ΔE_para = μ_B * B = (9.274e-24 J/T)(1 T) = 9.274e-24 J.

Compare this to ΔE = 4.09e-19 J. The ratio is 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5.

Expressed as an order of magnitude, that's approximately 1e-5. So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

But let me check if I got this right. Maybe they wanted the paramagnetic coupling energy (ΔE_para) compared to the transition energy (ΔE). If the ratio is 2.27e-5, then ΔE_para is ~10^-5 times smaller, so their orders of magnitude differ by ~5. That is, ΔE_para is order 1e-24 J, ΔE is order 1e-19 J.

Alternatively, if we compute the ratio the other way, the transition energy is ~4e-19, the paramagnetic term is ~1e-23 (since 9.27e-24 is ~1e-23).  The transition energy is about 4e-19 / 1e-23 = 4e4 times larger. So ratio ~1e4, or four orders of magnitude. Wait, so 1e4? Wait, no: 1e-19 versus 1e-24. The exponent difference is 5. So 1e-19 is 10^5 times bigger than 1e-24. So, the transition energy is five orders of magnitude larger. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. That contradicts my earlier calculation? Let's double-check the numbers.

Wait, ΔE_para = 9.27e-24 J

ΔE = 4.09e-19 J

So, ΔE_para / ΔE = 9.27e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5 ≈ 2.27 × 10^-5. So that's approximately 2.27e-5, which is ~1e-5. So the ratio is of the order 10^-5, meaning that ΔE_para is five orders of magnitude smaller than ΔE. So the answer is that the paramagnetic term is ~10^-5 times the transition energy, so five orders smaller.

Alternatively, if you take the log10(1e-5) = -5, so five orders of magnitude smaller.

But I think order of magnitude is powers of ten. So if one is ~1e-19 and the other ~1e-24, the difference in exponents is 5, so five orders of magnitude. So paramagnetic is 1e-24, transition 1e-19, there's 1e5 difference.

But in terms of orders of magnitude, when the exponent is n, saying they differ by n orders. So the ratio here is 1e-5, so paramagnetic is five orders of magnitude smaller. Which can also be stated as the transition energy is five orders of magnitude larger.

Alternatively, writing ΔE_para / ΔE ≈ 1e-5. So ratio ≈ 10^-5, hence five orders difference. That seems correct.

Is there any assumption I made that could be wrong? Maybe assuming m=1? The problem states that m is small, which could mean m=1, or maybe m=0; but for paramagnetism, the energy shift is proportional to m. If m=0, then the paramagnetic term is zero. Wait, but they mention the paramagnetic coupling term, which would have to do with the coupling between the magnetic moment and the external field. So, perhaps they want the maximum possible term for small m, which would be m=1 (as higher m might not be considered "small"? No, m can be 1, 0, -1 for p orbitals, but maybe in this case, for Hydrogen states, the maximum might be 1. Alternatively, maybe they are considering transitions between states with m=1 and m=0 or such.

But the problem states "paramagnetic coupling term" − the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is proportional to (e/(2m_e)) B L_z, which leads to the energy shift μ_B B m. But in calculating ΔE_para for a transition, if the transition is between m and m+1 (or m and m') then Δm = 0, ±1. But wait, perhaps you have to consider whether we are looking at the splitting ΔE between adjacent m levels. Because the question says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE".

Wait, perhaps I need to think about this differently.

In the absence of a magnetic field, the transition energy is ΔE (related to the wavelength given). When you apply a magnetic field, the energy levels split into different m levels due to the paramagnetic term. The question is perhaps comparing the energy splitting between different m levels (which is paramagnetic term) versus the transition energy ΔE.

In that case, if the transition is between two energy levels (say, n=3 to n=2, the Balmer series), then without magnetic field, energy separation is ΔE. With magnetic field, each of these levels splits into m levels (say, for l=1, m=-1, 0, +1), so the splitting between adjacent m levels is μ_B * B. Therefore, the energy shifts are ±μ_B B for m = ±1. So the maximum shift from the original energy level (at B=0) would be μ_B B. The splitting between m=+1 and m=-1 would be 2μ_B B. However, for a given transition between different n levels, the transition energy would include the difference in the main energy levels (dependent on n) and the splitting due to m.

Therefore, when comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (splitting due to m) to ΔE (transition without field), the ratio would be (μ_B B) / (ΔE) ≈ 1e-5 as calculated before. Hence, the paramagnetic term is about 1e-5 times smaller than the transition energy.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy of the Hydrogen atom for B=1T.

But to make sure, let me confirm each step again.

First, ΔE (transition energy) computed via λ=0.4861μm. Yes, that's correct. You used hc/λ. You can cross-verify with the Rydberg formula? For hydrogen, the transition might be between n=4 to n=2 (Balmer series Hβ line? Hα is 656 nm, Hβ is 486 nm which is 0.486μm). So the Rydberg formula:

1/λ = R_H (1/n_low^2 - 1/n_high^2). For Hβ, n_low=2, n_high=4. Then 1/λ = 1.097e4 (1/4 - 1/16) = 1.097e4 * 3/16 ≈ 2.06e3 m^-1. Therefore, λ ≈ 1/2.06e3 ≈ 4.85e-7 m = 0.485μm. Which matches the given λ=0.4861μm. So that's correct. Hence, the transition is n=4 to n=2, so ΔE corresponds to the energy difference between n=4 and n=2.

The energy levels of hydrogen are E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2. So E_4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV, E_2 = -13.6 / 4 = -3.4 eV. The transition energy ΔE is E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV, but the energy of the photon emitted is 2.55 eV or 4.09e-19 J, which matches the earlier calculation. So that's correct.

Now the paramagnetic coupling term, which for m=1, is μ_B * B ≈ 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.27e-24 J. The transition energy is 4.09e-19 J, so dividing gives ≈ 2.26e-5. So in terms of order of magnitude, it's 10^-5.

Therefore, yes, the paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller. So the orders of magnitude are 10^-24 (paramagnetic) vs 10^-19 (transition), giving a ratio of 10^-5. So when the question says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy", they likely mean the ratio is ~1e-5, so five orders of magnitude less.

Thus, the paramagnetic term is approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

I think that's the conclusion. Just need to verify that there are no missing factors. For example, sometimes the Zeeman energy is written with a factor of (m l), but in the correct Zeeman effect formula for orbital angular momentum, the energy shift is indeed μ_B * B * m. Since for orbital angular momentum, the magnetic quantum number m ranges from -l to +l. But in the problem statement, they mention small m, so perhaps considering transitions where l isn't too large; but since the specific transition here is n=4 to n=2, and the angular momentum quantum numbers for Hydrogen in these states would be l=0,1,2,3 for n=4, but when transitioning from n=4 to n=2, l can change by ±1. Therefore, depending on the specific states involved in the transition, m can vary. However, the maximum shift would still be μ_B * B * m, with m up to l, but since they mention small m, maybe m=1. But even so, it affects the maximum possible shift, but in general, the order of magnitude would still be μ_B * B, considering m=1, as we did.

Therefore, I think the conclusion is solid. The paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman energy) is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the photon energy from the Hydrogen transition at λ=0.4861 μm under a 1T magnetic field.

Okay, so I need to compare the order of magnitude between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE in a Hydrogen atom. The given magnetic field is B=1T, parallel to the Oz axis, and the transition corresponds to a wavelength of λ=0.4861 μm. Also, it mentions small values of the orbital magnetic quantum number m.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate each term separately first and then compare their magnitudes.

Starting with ΔE, the transition energy. The wavelength given is 0.4861 μm, which is in the visible range. Let's convert that to meters: 0.4861 μm = 0.4861 × 10^-6 m. Then, using ΔE = hc/λ.

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s

c = 3.00 × 10^8 m/s

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.00e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m)

Calculating the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.09e-19 J

So ΔE ≈ 4.09 × 10^-19 Joules.

I can also express this in electronvolts since it's a common unit for energy levels in atoms. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. That seems reasonable for a visible wavelength transition in hydrogen, probably part of the Balmer series.

Now, the paramagnetic term. The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T.

Given that B = 1 T and m is small, probably m = 1 (since it's mentioned small m, so maybe ±1 or 0, but for the maximum effect, we can take m=1). However, depending on the transition, m could be changing by ±1 or 0. Wait, but maybe here we just need the magnitude of the Zeeman energy shift compared to the transition energy.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to find the ratio between the Zeeman splitting and the energy of the transition. Then, the question is, for a magnetic field of 1T, how does the Zeeman term compare in magnitude to the transition energy corresponding to 0.4861 micron.

I need to compare the order of magnitude between the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE in a Hydrogen atom. Given information includes a magnetic field B=1T parallel to the Oz axis, and a transition with wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. The problem also mentions small values of the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Let me begin by reviewing some fundamental concepts.

The paramagnetic coupling term likely refers to the Zeeman effect, which causes atomic energy levels to split due to interactions between magnetic moments and external magnetic fields. The energy shift from the paramagnetic (Zeeman) effect is expressed as ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B represents the Bohr magneton.

The transition energy ΔE relates to the photon wavelength through the equation ΔE = hc/λ, with h being Planck's constant and c representing light speed. I need to determine the ratio of these energies (ΔE_para / ΔE) and analyze their orders of magnitude.

I should calculate each term individually before comparing them.

For the transition energy ΔE, I'll first convert the wavelength to meters: 0.4861 μm = 0.4861 × 10^-6 m. Then using ΔE = hc/λ with the values:

h = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s
c = 3.00 × 10^8 m/s

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.00e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m)

The numerator equals approximately 1.9878e-25 J·m, and dividing by 0.4861e-6 m gives approximately 4.09e-19 J.

Therefore, ΔE ≈ 4.09 × 10^-19 Joules.

Converting to electronvolts (1 eV = 1.602e-19 J): 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV, which seems consistent with a visible wavelength transition in hydrogen, possibly from the Balmer series.

For the paramagnetic term, the energy shift is ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m. The Bohr magneton μ_B equals approximately 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T.

With B = 1 T and considering small m values (likely m = 1 for maximum effect), although m could change by ±1 or 0 depending on the transition. The question may be asking about the ratio between Zeeman splitting and the transition energy at the specified magnetic field strength and wavelength.

Certainly! Here's the rephrased text:

Alright, I need to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE in a hydrogen atom. The given magnetic field is B = 1T and is aligned with the Oz axis, and the transition corresponds to a wavelength of λ = 0.4861 μm. The problem also refers to small values of the orbital magnetic quantum number m. Let’s recall some fundamental concepts.

The paramagnetic coupling term in the presence of a magnetic field probably refers to the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect involves the splitting of atomic energy levels due to the interaction between the magnetic moment and an external magnetic field. The energy shift due to the paramagnetic (Zeeman) effect is given by ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B represents the Bohr magneton.

Meanwhile, the transition energy ΔE is related to the wavelength of the photon absorbed or emitted by the equation ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. The task is to find the ratio of these energies: ΔE_para / ΔE and determine their orders of magnitude.

However, it might be better to calculate each term independently and then compare their magnitudes.

Starting with ΔE, the transition energy is given for a wavelength of 0.4861 μm, which falls within the visible spectrum. Let’s convert this to meters: 0.4861 μm = 0.4861 × 10^-6 m. Then, using ΔE = hc/λ, we can calculate:

h = 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s

c = 3.00 × 10^8 m/s

Thus, ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3.00e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m)

Calculating the numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.09e-19 J

So, ΔE is approximately 4.09 × 10^-19 Joules.

It can also be expressed in electronvolts, a common unit for atomic energy levels. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, then 4.09e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. That’s reasonable for a visible wavelength transition in hydrogen, likely part of the Balmer series.

Now, for the paramagnetic term, the energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m, with the Bohr magneton μ_B approximately 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T.

With B = 1 T and assuming small m, probably m = 1 (since small m was mentioned, it might be ±1 or 0, but assuming the maximum effect, we use m=1). Depending on the transition, m could vary by ±1 or 0. However, we might just need the magnitude of the Zeeman energy shift compared to the transition energy.

Alternatively, we need to determine the ratio between the Zeeman splitting and the energy of the transition. So, for a magnetic field of 1T, how does the Zeeman term, in magnitude, compare to the transition energy of a 0.4861 micron wavelength?

Although the exact transition relates to specific quantum numbers, the...

To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \(\Delta E\) of a Hydrogen atom, we start by calculating both energies separately.

1. **Transition Energy (\(\Delta E\))**:
   The transition energy is related to the wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu m\) by the equation:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Converting the wavelength to meters:
   \[
   \lambda = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electronvolts:
   \[
   \Delta E \approx \frac{4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\(\Delta E_{\text{para}}\))**:
   The energy shift due to the paramagnetic (Zeeman) effect is given by:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m
   \]
   where \(\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\), \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\), and \(m = 1\) (small value):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \cdot 1 \, \text{T} \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electronvolts:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}
   \]

3. **Ratio Comparison**:
   Comparing the magnitudes:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{para}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}}{4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   This ratio shows that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \(10^{-5}\) times the transition energy.

### Final Answer
The order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term compared to the transition energy is \boxed{10^{-5}}.

0.4861 μm wavelength is likely the H-beta line of the Balmer series, which corresponds to the transition from n=4 to n=2. The energy difference would be ΔE = 13.6 eV*(1/2² - 1/4²) = 13.6*(1/4 - 1/16) = 13.6*(3/16) ≈ 2.55 eV, which matches the calculation above. Good.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term, ΔE_para. Let's compute this for m=1, B=1T.

ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J

Convert to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV

So, in eV, ΔE_para ≈ 5.79 × 10^-5 eV, and the transition energy is ~2.55 eV.

Comparing the two: ratio = (5.79e-5 eV) / (2.55 eV) ≈ 2.27e-5. So that's approximately 2.27 × 10^-5.

Taking orders of magnitude: ΔE_para is of the order 10^-5 times ΔE.

But wait, perhaps I was supposed to present it in terms of their absolute energies as well. Let me confirm.

ΔE ≈ 4.09e-19 J

ΔE_para ≈ 9.27e-24 J

So the ratio is 9.27e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5, same as above.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, their orders of magnitude are: paramagnetic term ~10^-24 J, transition energy ~10^-19 J, so ΔE_para is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than ΔE.

Alternatively, using exponents, 10^-24 vs. 10^-19: the difference is 10^5, so ratio ~1e-5. So yes, order of magnitude is 10^-5.

But need to check if the m is not larger. Wait, the problem states "small values of m". Typically, m for hydrogen can be up to l, where l is the azimuthal quantum number. The transition from n=4 to n=2 would involve l values up to 3 (for n=4, l=0,1,2,3; for n=2, l=0,1). The change in m (Δm) in transitions can be 0, ±1 due to selection rules. But m itself for each state can be from -l to +l.

However, in the Zeeman effect, the splitting is determined by m, and for the paramagnetic term, the energy shift depends on m. Here, since B is along Oz, it's the ordinary Zeeman effect. If the transition is between states with m and m', then the shift would be proportional to (m' - m)μ_B B. But for the purpose here, since we're just comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic term (which is on the order of μ_B B) versus the transition energy, perhaps m is taken as 1 or any small integer. But since m itself for each state is bounded by l, and if we're considering small m, maybe m=1. So as above, the term is on the order of 1e-24 J, which is 1e-5 smaller than 1e-19 J.

Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. So the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is 1e-24 J and transition energy is 1e-19 J; so their ratio is ~1e-5.

But let me check again: sometimes in these comparisons, factors like 2 or π are neglected as order of magnitude estimates, but I think in this case, exact coefficient is 2.27e-5, which is approximately 1e-5, so order of magnitude is 1e-5.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the paramagnetic coupling term is roughly 10^-5 times the transition energy, so they differ by five orders of magnitude.

**Final Answer**
The order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term compared to the transition energy is \boxed{10^{-5}}.

The paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman effect) and the transition energy \(\Delta E\) in a hydrogen atom under a magnetic field \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\) and a transition wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m}\) are compared as follows:

1. **Transition Energy (\(\Delta E\)):**  
   Using the photon energy formula \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\):  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}} \approx 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \, \text{(or } 2.55 \, \text{eV)}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\(\Delta E_{\text{para}}\)):**

Calculating ΔE_para with m=1:

ΔE_para = (9.274e-24 J/T)(1 T)(1) = 9.274e-24 J.

Now, the ratio of ΔE_para to ΔE is (9.274e-24 J) / (4.09e-19 J) ≈ 2.27 × 10^-5.

This suggests that the paramagnetic coupling term is on the order of 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy ΔE. Alternatively, the transition energy is about five orders of magnitude larger than the paramagnetic term. The problem may reference "order of magnitude," so each term's exponents (-5 compared to base) mean the paramagnetic term is 10^-5 the transition energy.

Alternatively, factors like selection rules (Δm = 0, ±1) could allow comparisons between energy shifts and the unperturbed transition energy. Since typical Zeeman splitting at 1T is in the range of ~10^-4 eV (since μ_B*B ~ 0.0000579 eV/T; so 1T gives ~5.79e-5 eV), compared to the transition energy of ~2.55 eV here. So ΔE_para ≈ 5.79e-5 eV versus ΔE ≈2.55 eV. Their ratio is approximately (5.79e-5) / 2.55 ≈2.27e-5, same as previous calculation.

Therefore, the paramagnetic term is four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy, so the order of magnitude difference is around 10^-5, implying the transition energy is about 10^5 times larger than the paramagnetic coupling term. Thus, my conclusion would be that the paramagnetic term is roughly five orders of magnitude smaller. Although, given specific values, perhaps log(2.27e-5) ~ -4.64, so roughly 10^-5, which is five orders of magnitude.

In the problem, it might be acceptable to state that the paramagnetic term is approximately ~1e-5 times the transition energy, i.e., a ratio of ~10^-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling is of order 10^-5 compared to the transition energy.

Let me verify the energy difference between n=4 and n=2. The Rydberg formula gives 1/λ = R(1/n_f^2 - 1/n_i^2), where R is the Rydberg constant ~1.097e7 m^-1. For n_f=2, n_i=4:\n\n1/λ = 1.097e7 (1/4 - 1/16) = 1.097e7*(3/16) = 2.056e6 m^-1\n\n⇒ λ = 1 / 2.056e6 ≈ 4.86e-7 m = 486 nm, which matches.

To compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \(\Delta E\) of a Hydrogen atom for a magnetic field \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\) and wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m}\):

1. **Calculate the transition energy \(\Delta E\):**
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]
   Using \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\):

   \]
   Converting to electronvolts (1 eV = \(1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

2. **Calculate the paramagnetic coupling term \(\Delta E_{\text{para}}\):**
   The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is given by:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m
   \]
   Using \(\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\), \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\), and \(m = 1\):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \times 1 \times 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electronvolts:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{para}} \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}
   \]

3. **Compare the magnitudes:**
   The ratio of the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E_{\text{para}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}}{2.55 \, \text{eV}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}
   \]
   This ratio is approximately \(10^{-5}\), indicating the paramagnetic coupling term is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

### Final Answer
The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \boxed{10^{-5}} times the transition energy \(\Delta E\) of the Hydrogen atom.

 Since water under the bridge, perhaps we can answer in terms of order of magnitude.

First, compute ΔE_para = μ_B * B * m. Let's take m=1. So:

ΔE_para = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J

Meanwhile, ΔE we calculated as about 4.09e-19 J.

Taking the ratio, ΔE_para / ΔE = 9.274e-24 / 4.09e-19 ≈ 2.268e-5, which is approximately 2.27 × 10^-5. Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 times the transition energy, meaning the paramagnetic term is four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

This makes sense because the Zeeman effect usually leads to small energy shifts compared to the primary transition energies, except in very strong magnetic fields or for Rydberg states with high quantum numbers. Since this is hydrogen and a 1T field (which isn't astronomical in terms of lab magnetic fields), the Zeeman splitting is modest.

However, maybe I should check where the given λ fits in the hydrogen spectrum. The wavelength of 0.4861 μm corresponds to 486.1 nm, which indeed belongs to the Balmer series—this is the H-beta line, transitioning from n=4 to n=2. Let me verify the energy difference between n=4 and n=2. The Rydberg formula gives 1/λ = R(1/n_f^2 - 1/n_i^2), where R is the Rydberg constant ~1.097e7 m^-1. For n_f=2, n_i=4:

1/λ = 1.097e7 (1/4 - 1/16) = 1.097e7*(3/16) = 2.056e6 m^-1

⇒ λ = 1 / 2.056e6 ≈ 4.86e-7 m = 486 nm, which matches. The energy of this photon is then E = hc/λ ≈ 1240 eV·nm / 486 nm ≈ 2.55 eV, as calculated before.

The splitting due to the Zeeman effect at 1T would be meV scale? Let me go through the calculation again.

μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T; B=1 T; m=1; so energy shift ΔE_para = 9.274e-24 J. In eV, that's 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV = 0.0579 meV. Compare to the transition energy which is 2.55 eV. The ratio would be 0.0579e-3 eV / 2.55 eV ≈ 2.27e-5, same as before. So, indeed the order is ~10^-5, meaning paramagnetic term is about 0.002% of the transition energy.

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller (since 10^-5 is five orders). Therefore, the conclusion is that the paramagnetic term is roughly 10^-5 times smaller, so four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

Alternatively, by order of magnitude, if the transition energy is ~1 eV (actually 2.55 eV here), and the paramagnetic term is ~0.1 meV, which is 1e-4 eV, so 1e-4 eV compared to 1 eV is 1e-4, which is 10^-4. Though in our case, since energy is 2.55 eV, 5.79e-5 eV is a ratio of ~ 2.27e-5. Hmm. So (correctly) precise the ratio is approximately 2.3e-5, so ~10^-5.

Therefore, order of magnitude is 10^-5.

But wait 5.79e-5 eV is 10^-5 as compared to 1 eV. Since transition is 2.55 eV, then 5.79e-5/2.55 = ~2.27e-5, which is ~2 x10^-5. So somewhat less than an order of 10^-5. But "order of magnitude" probably is in the vicinity of 10^-5; might refer to the exponent, so -5. Thus, order of magnitude difference is 5, meaning paramagnetic term is five orders of magnitude smaller.

Wait, but 2.27 x10^-5 is essentially 1e-5 order of magnitude. For order of magnitude estimates, anything from 1e-5 to 1e-4 is two OoMs. But in this case, 2.27e-5 is approximately 1e-5, so considered as 10^-5.

Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is about 10^-5 of the transition energy. This is the answer, but in terms of orders of magnitude, how to phrase?

The question says "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy".

Therefore, their ratio would be ~1e-5, thus paramagnetic term is about 10^-5 times smaller than the transition energy. Hence, the answer is order of magnitude difference: paramagnetic term is ~5 orders of magnitude smaller than ΔE.

**Final Answer**
The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \boxed{10^{-5}} times the transition energy \(\Delta E\) of the Hydrogen atom.
