# Original Question

Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.
Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).

**Answer:**

**A. Benzoquinone**  
Benzoquinone (specifically para-benzoquinone) lacks alpha hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl groups. Without these hydrogens, it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has multiple alpha hydrogens (on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups), enabling tautomerism via enol formation.

**B. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
This compound has a chiral center at the second carbon, which is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl (-CH₃), a carboxylate ester (-COOCH₃), and a hydrogen (-H). This asymmetry allows for optical isomerism (enantiomers). Dimethyl fumarate, however, is symmetrical due to its trans double bond configuration, resulting in a plane of symmetry and no chiral centers, thus no optical isomerism.

**Final Answer:**  
A = Benzoquinone  
B = Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate  

**Format:**  
(A) \boxed{Benzoquinone}  
(B) \boxed{Methyl~2\text{-}hydroxypropanoate}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about two pairs of compounds. For the first pair, benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, we need to determine which one does not show tautomerism (which they're calling compound A). Then, for the second pair, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, we need to find out which one shows optical isomerism (compound B). Alright, let's start with the first part.

Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where compounds can rapidly interconvert between isomers via the migration of a proton, usually accompanied by a switch in the position of a double bond. Common types are keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the transfer of a hydrogen between a carbonyl group (keto form) and an alcohol (enol form). So, for a compound to exhibit tautomerism, it should have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to a carbon with a hydrogen (alpha hydrogen), allowing for the keto-enol shift. Let's analyze both compounds in the first pair.

Benzoquinone. Wait, there are different benzoquinones depending on the positions of the carbonyl groups. The common ones are 1,2-benzoquinone (ortho) and 1,4-benzoquinone (para). But given the name just as benzoquinone, I think it's typically the 1,4 isomer that's referred to. Benzoquinone has a benzene ring with two ketone (carbonyl) groups in the para positions. Structure-wise, each carbonyl is at opposite ends. Now, can this undergo keto-enol tautomerism?

For keto-enol tautomerism, having a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl is necessary. But in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to two oxygens otherwise. Wait, benzoquinone's structure is O=C6H4=O (para). Wait, each ketone is a ring carbonyl. So, in that structure, the carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic ring? Wait, no. In quinones, the carbonyls are part of the conjugated system but not in the same way as in benzene. For example, cyclohexane-1,4-dione is a diketone with carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. But benzoquinone is a conjugated carbonyl system. Let me draw this mentally. The benzoquinone (para) structure is a benzene ring where two of the CH groups are replaced with carbonyl groups. So, like O=C-C6H4-C(=O)-, but arranged para. The carbonyl groups are adjacent to aromatic carbons not bearing hydrogens. Wait, actually, benzoquinone gets rid of two double bonds in the benzene ring for the quinone structure. The standard structure of para-benzoquinone has two ketone groups on the benzene ring in para positions, right? So, hydrocarbons adjacent to the carbonyls in the ring. Now, the alpha carbons to the carbonyls here would be the adjacent carbons in the ring. However, in para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to two adjacent carbons of the ring. Wait, the actual structure is a ring with six members, alternate single and double bonds, with two carbonyl groups opposite each other, such that they are part of the conjugated system. Hence, each carbonyl group is connected to the ring carbons with double bonds adjacent. Wait maybe:

Structure would be:

O=C–C–C=C–C–C(=O)

Arranged in a six-membered ring. But I'm not sure if that's accurate, perhaps the exact positions matter. Wait, the standard para-benzoquinone structure has two ketone groups on the ring in 1,4 positions. The adjacent carbonyl groups would have CH2 positions if it's in cyclohexene, but actually, in para-benzoquinone, the arrangement is aromatic-like, but in benzenoid structure with two ketone groups. The key question for tautomerism is if there's a hydrogen atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group that can deprotonate to form an enol.

But in benzoquinone, are there alpha hydrogens? Let's see. Each carbonyl is on a carbon attached to two other carbons (since in a ring) but is there a hydrogen on that carbon? Wait, in the quinone structure, the carbonyl groups are on carbons that are next to carbons that are part of the conjugated double bonds. Let me think about the specifics. Benzoquinone is a cyclohexadienedione. So cyclohexene with two ketones. Let’s look at structure:

In 1,4-cyclohexadienedione, which is para-benzoquinone. So there’s a six-membered ring with two ketone oxygens opposite each other. The carbons with the ketone groups (positions 1 and 4) are each double-bonded to an oxygen. The adjacent carbons (2,3,5,6) should have double bonds in the ring. So the structure is alternating. Wait, the actual structure would have conjugated double bonds between C1-C2 (if C1 is the ketone at position 1) and between C3-C4 (but C4 is another carbonyl?), maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe only one conjugated system. Hmm, maybe I should visualize benzoquinone's molecular structure properly. Alternatively, let's take benzoquinone as a benzene ring with two oxygen substituents in the para positions, each in the form of carbonyl groups (–C=O). So, the carbons with the carbonyl groups are each connected to the oxygen and to two adjacent carbons of the benzene ring. In that case, these carbons (1 and 4) would not have any hydrogens, because each is bonded to the oxygen (double bond, so no H) and to the ring carbons, which only in the benzene would have H; but those carbons (1 and 4) themselves: Can a carbon with a carbonyl group (C=O) have hydrogen attached?

Wait, carbonyl groups are typically R-C=O, where the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, and single-bonded to R (another carbon) and so that carbon (the carbonyl carbon) doesn't have any hydrogens. For example, in acetone, (CH3)2CO, the carbonyl carbon has two CH3 groups and a double bond to O, no H. Therefore, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons (positions 1 and 4) are each double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two carbons of the aromatic ring.

Given this, those carbonyl carbons (positions 1 and 4 in para) are fully substituted with two aromatic ring carbons and a double bond to O, so no hydrogen atoms. Therefore, those positions cannot undergo enol tautomerism because there's no alpha hydrogen (H on the adjacent carbon). Wait, keto-enol tautomerism happens when there's an alpha hydrogen to the carbonyl group. If there's no hydrogen on the adjacent carbons, tautomerism can't occur.

But wait maybe I should double-check. The carbonyl group is in the para position. For enol tautomerism, the alpha carbon (the one next to carbonyl) must have a hydrogen. The substituents on the benzene ring attached to the carbonyl, those carbons are part of the ring. But in para-benzoquinone, the only substituents are the O groups. So the carbonyl carbons are parts of the ring structure where they are connected via conjugated double bonds. Let me state this again: In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at a position where their adjacent carbons are in a conjugated double bond.

Wait, perhaps I am overcomplicating. Let's think: enol form requires a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. If in benzoquinone there are no hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups, then it can't have keto-enol tautomerism. But if there's a hydrogen, it can. How do the adjacent carbons look like?

Assuming a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups (as in para), each carbonyl would be at positions 1 and 4. The structure would be O=C-aryl-C(=O), with the rest of the ring's double bonds. But each carbonyl group is on two adjacent carbons? Wait no. Let's model benzene (a six-carbon ring).

If positions 1 and 4 have ketone groups. Then, structure would be:

C1=O connected to C2 and C6.

C4=O connected to C3 and C5.

In between, the double bonds would be C2-C3 and C5-C6, perhaps. Then, carbons 2,3,5,6 each have one double bond and two single bonds. Then, adjacent to the carbonyl C1 is C2 and C6. Are there hydrogens on C2 and C6 here? If the ring has normal alternating double bonds (i.e., ortho positions with double bonds and para with ketone groups) then actual positions may have double bonds between C1 and C2 (but no, if C1 is a carbonyl carbon?), hmm no. Wait, maybe the structure is:

C1 is double-bonded to O (so C=O)

The benzene ring then has double bonds between C2-C3 and C4-C5 (since para is positions 1 and 4), but this seems confusing. Alternatively, in para-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4. These are sentolecule, so the ring has two double bonds adjacent to each carbonyl. Let me search... Actually, it's known that quinones are fully conjugated, so perhaps each carbonyl group is conjugated into the ring. But benzene suppresses keto-enol tautomerism because the conjugated structure is more stable. Alternatively, if the ring's carbonyls have adjacent double bonds, those might lock them into the keto form. Alternatively, without alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but another thought. If a molecule has no enolizable hydrogens (alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl group), then it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

In benzoquinone, specifically, let's say the position is:

Each carbonyl carbon (C1 and C4) is part of a conjugated system. Are there any hydrogens on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl carbons?

In para-quinone, each of the two carbonyl carbons (C1 and C4) are attached to two adjacent carbons (so C1 is bonded to C2 and C6, and C4 is bonded to C3 and C5). If the double bonds in the ring are between C2-C3 and C5-C6, then each of those carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) would have one double bond and one single bond in the ring. Now, do those carbons have hydrogens? In the quinone structure, most likely, each ring carbon adjacent to the carbonyl groups is double-bonded to another carbon. In other words, C2 is double-bonded to C3, so C2 is attached to C1 (carbonyl group?), single bond to C:H? Wait no. Wait if it's conjugated. The presence of double bonds could influence the existence of hydrogens. Let's consider this:

In para-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-(C5H3)−C(=O). Wait, perhaps each carbonyl carbon is actually linked to a CH group. Hmmm, maybe this is better imagined.

Alternatively a specific example could help. Let me think of the dienone structure. For example, 2,5-cyclohexadien-1,4-dione. Such a structure would have two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, and double bonds at positions 2-3 and 5-6. Its structure would be:

O=C–CH–CH2–CH–CH2–C(=O), arranged in a ring. But that seems inconsistent, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead refer to general knowledge. Quinones do not typically enolize because they lack alpha hydrogens. Because once you have a para quinone structure, the positions adjacent to the carbonyls (ortho positions) are each part of the conjugated double bonds. Thus, those adjacent carbon atoms (ortho to carbonyl) are double-bonded to the next carbon, leaving them without hydrogen atoms. Therefore, there are no alpha hydrogens available for enolization, preventing keto-enol tautomerism. Hence, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.

Now, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. This compound has three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5 of a cyclohexane ring. So it's a six-membered cyclohexane ring with ketone groups at every other carbon (1,3,5). Now, each ketone (cyclohexane-trione) resembles something like tricyclohexanol, but with three ketones. Each carbonyl group is on a carbon adjacent to two other carbonyls. Wait, Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three carbonyl groups each at positions 1, 3, 5 of the cyclohexane. The question is, are there alpha hydrogens adjacent to each of those carbonyl groups. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl (at positions 1,3,5) is connected to two neighboring carbons (in the cyclohexane), which each would be adjacent to another carbonyl.

So taking position 1 carbonyl: it's on C1, so neighboring carbons are C2 and C6. Are there hydrogens on C2 and C6? If the cyclohexane is chair or another conformation, those positions would have hydrogens. But for tautomerism, you need alpha Hs. So each carbonyl has adjacent carbons (C2 and C6 for C1) which are in the cycle. If cyclohexane is a six-membered ring in the chair conformation, but trione is flat. Wait each C adjacent to CO, is CH2. Because cyclohexane carbons are each CH2. So if the ring still has CH2 groups between COs. For example:

At C1: C=O
At C2: CH2 (adjacent to C1 and C3)
At C3: C=O
At C4: CH2
At C5: C=O
At C6: CH2

If this is the structure, then each CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl groups (so C2 next to C1, C4 next to C3, and C6 next to C5) would have hydrogens. So, each carbonyl group (at 1,3,5) will have alpha hydrogens on their adjacent carbons (C2, C4, C6).

Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, because alpha CH2 groups adjacent to ketones can lose a proton to form enol structures, with conjugated double bonds. This would be triggered via the presence of acid or base but since the compound has multiple carbonyl groups offering more sites for possible tautomerism. So for each ketone group, the adjacent CH2's alpha Hs can lead to enol forms. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would be capable of tautomerism.

Therefore, between benzoquinone (no alpha H's, so no tautomerism) and cyclohexane-trione (has alpha H's and can tautomerize), then the compound A that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

So answer (A) is benzoquinone.

Now, moving to the second part: looking at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one exhibits optical isomerism (B).

First, optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center (asymmetric carbon) or another type of chirality, like a plane or axis. The most common is a chiral center - a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Let's examine the two compounds:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break down the structure. Propanoate is the ester of propanoic acid. The parent is propanoic acid: CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. But when esterified with methanol (methyl ester) at the carboxylic acid group, it would become methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So structure is: methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be:

HCOOCH2–C(OH)(CH3)–OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the actual structure needs to be correct. Let me better detail it.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the hydroxyl group is on the second carbon of the chain. So, the structure is HOOC-CHOH-CH3? Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Wait, three carbons. Carboxylic acid on carbon 1: -COOH, then carbon 2: CH(OH)-, carbon 3: CH3.

But when the ester is formed, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted to an ester (-COOCH3). So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. However, the structure would be:

The parent chain is propane- (3 carbons). Carbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group). Carbon 2: hydroxyl group (OH) and a hydrogen. Carbon 3: methyl group (CH3). So, the structure is[CH3-OOC-C(OH)H-CH3]. Wait, but for propanoate, it starts with the carboxylic acid (COO-) on carbon 1, so the ester would be COOCH3 on carbon 1, then carbon 2 is CH(OH)-R, and carbon 3 is CH3. Wait, maybe I rearranged.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be at the second carbon so HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No: wait, n=propanoic acid is CH3-CH2-COOH. Then, the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon, which is CH2. So it's CH2(OH) between CH3 and COOH. So, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified, the COOH becomes COOCH3: so methyl ester is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So structure: The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to –CH3 (from carbon 1), hydroxyl (-OH), –COOCH3 (from carbon 3), and hydrogen. Wait, no: n=the propion acid chain is COOH adjacent to two other carbons. Let's number carbons as 1, 2, 3.

- Carbon 1: COOCH3 (as it's the ester)
- Carbon 2: CH(OH)
- Carbon 3: CH3

Wait no, wait: the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? That can't be. Wait maybe I'm getting confused with numbering here.

Wait, I think hydroxypropanoic acids and their esters can be tricky. The name may need careful consideration. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. When we substitute hydroxy group at the second carbon (the central carbon), so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be: CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. When esterified as the methyl ester, the COOH becomes COOCH3, so:

The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- two methyl groups (from the original CH3 and from the COOCH3?), wait no.

Wait, carbon 1: COOCH3 (if we start numbering from the COOCH3 end). So, the highest priority group is the COOCH3 (ester), and numbering gives the lowest number to the substituent.

Alternatively, in the IUPAC name, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:

The parent ester is propanoate, which is a three-carbon chain with the ester group. The hydroxy group is on carbon 2. So the structure would be:

O

|

OCH3-C-OH

|

CH2- COOCH3?

Alternatively, thinking in terms of the structure:

The carboxylic acid is on the first carbon, which gets esterified. Then the hydroxy group is on the second carbon of the propanoate.

Therefore, propanoate three carbons: 1 – COOCH3, 2 – with OH, and 3 – CH3? Wait, propanoate would be CH2CH2COOCH3. If the hydroxyl is on the second carbon (CHOH), then it's:

COOCH3 is carbon 1,

carbon 2 is CH(OH) and carbon 3 is CH3.

Therefore, structure: COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. Then does the central carbon (carbon 2) have four different substituents? Let's check:

Carbon 2 is attached to:

1. COOCH3 (from the left, via a methyl ester)

2. HO- (hydroxyl group)

3. CH3 (methyl group, carbon 3)

4. The adjacent CH (between COOCH3 and CH3). Wait no, carbon 2 has:

Carbon 2 is in the middle, connected to:

- On one side: COOCH3 (Carbon 1)

- On the other side: CH3 (Carbon 3)

- Also attached is -OH

- And what else?

Wait, unless the structure is:

        O

        |

O-C-O-CH3

       |

CH3-C-OCH3

        OH

But this get messy.

Wait, sorry, let's draw it clearly.

Structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:

The propionate is three carbons:

Carbonyl group (from ester) is on carbon 1: O||C-OCH3

Adjacent to that carbon (carbon alpha): CH(OH), and then next carbon (carbon 2): CH3.

Wait, propanoate is carbon chain:

Carbon 1: OCOOCH3 (wrong, ester is OCO-?)

Wait, structure of ester: the ester group is -OCO-R. Propanoic acid methyl ester is CH2CH2COOCH3. Therefore, propanoate would be COOCH3 at carbon 1, then two more CH2 groups. But 2-hydroxy would then be on the first CH2 group.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group)

Carbon 2: CHOH (hydroxyl group)

Carbon 3: CH3?

This would make the structure: COOCH3-CHOH-CH3.

In that case, the molecule would have the structure:

O

||

O-C-OCH3

CH2

|

OH

CH3

Wait again, perhaps it's easier.

The formula would be: CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3.

So carbon 2 is connected to:

- The left side: OOC-OCH3 (from COOCH3 group, but the carbonyl is a double bond oxygen, so linking to carbon 2 as a single bond). Wait, perhaps for accuracy:

To phrase correctly:

The ester group is at carbon 1. The full structure would therefore be:

O 

||

C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3.

So the carbonyl group is between Carbon 1 and oxygen (double bond), ester group is OCH3 attached to the carbonyl carbon. Then, the next carbon (Carbon 2) is CH(OH), and Carbon 3 is CH3. So, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is bonded to:

- Carbon 1: COOCH3

- hydroxyl group (OH)

- Carbon 3: CH3

- And, a hydrogen.

Therefore, the four groups attached to Carbon 2 are:

COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H.

So Carbon 2 has four different groups. Hence, it's a chiral center, right?

Wait, COOCH3 (which is similar to a carbonyloxy group), hydroxyl (–OH), methyl (–CH3), and a hydrogen (–H). Since all four substituents are different, Carbon 2 is a chiral center.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and hence can exhibit optical isomerism (enantiomers). Therefore, optical isomerism is possible. Therefore, answer B would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But wait, we need to check the other compound, dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid). The structure is two ester groups on the trans-1,4 positions of butenedioic acid.

Fumarate is trans:

H-OOC-CH2-CH2-COO-H → but I think fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H with the double bond and the trans configuration. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond between C2 and C3. In the trans configuration, the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides.

But esterifying both carboxylic acids with methyl groups gives dimethyl fumarate, which is (Z)- or (E)-?

No, fumarate is already the trans isomer (E), while maleate is cis (Z). So dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester of trans-butenedioic acid: CH2=CH group with two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides.

Structure: OCH3OOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond in between.

Wait no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, no, wait no:

Wait, but fumaric acid is butenedioic acid, specifically the trans isomer. Structure: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, where the double bond is between the two central carbons (2 and 3), and the two carboxylic acid groups are across from each other (trans).

Which I can represent as:

 HOOC\C=C/COOH → trans-configuration.

Esterification with methanol replaces the -OH groups in the carboxylic acids with OCH3. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is:

 CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 where the double bond is trans (E configuration). 

So dimethyl fumarate is a molecule with a double bond (C=C) in the center, with each carbon of the double bonded to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen (in trans if it's fumarate). Wait, wait fumarate's structure is trans-diesters.

So the structure is:

        COOCH3  
          \  
           C=C  
          /  
        COOCH3

With the two ester groups on opposite sides (trans) of the double bond.

Now, does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center or any other element of chirality? It's possible.

The molecule has a trans double bond. To have a chiral center, a carbon must have four distinct groups. But in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon of the double bond is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group

- One H – (assuming structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH esterified, so CH from original CH=CH becomes H.

But in dimethyl fumarate (trans), the structure would be: OCH2C-OOC-CH=CH-COO-CH3?

No wait,-I think for fumarate, each COOCH3 is on respective CH’s:

The skeleton is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3), but adjusted for the double bond. Wait fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH is not unsaturated, but wait no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so inserting the double bond. Hence, esterification of fumaric acid (trans) would give OOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So structure:

COOCH3   COOCH3
    \     /
     C=C
    /     \
   H      H

But with the trans configuration. Each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and an H group, arranged when inverse.

Wait, but if that's the case, the two carbons in the double bond each have two different substituents: a COOCH3 and a H. Since in the trans configuration, each carbon's COOCH3 is across from each other. COOCH3 and H are on both ends. But the symmetry here: each carbon has H and COOCH3. But what about the other two bonds from each C in the double bond? Each is bonded to two more CH groups?

No, the full structure: But in fumarate, the double bond is between the two central carbons. Each of the two central carbons in dimethyl fumarate has:

Left carbon: COOCH3 and H

Right carbon: COOCH3 and H

But the double bond is between the left and right carbons, so each one is connected to two other carbons. But considering the actual structure better:

The correct structure should be O

             ||        
           O-C-OCH3    
                \
           CH2-C=C-CH2 
                /
           O-C-OCH3  
             ||

But given that fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, the sequence after esterification is:

CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 (trans configuration at the double bond). So, each C in the double bond (C and C) is bonded to:

- Left C: CH3OOC–, then bond to adjacent C (double bond), and two other substituents: On the left C of the double bond: is there any CH2?

Wait no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond? No, correct formula: Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Therefore,, after esterification, the dimethyl ester is CH3OOC-C(=CH2)-COOCH3, but the actual structure is:

*O* 
||   
O-C-OCH3  
     \
      C
     / \
    H   C(=O)OCH3
        |
        H

But the structure allows each carbon of the double bond (C and C) to be bonded to:

For left carbon: COOCH3 and H, and part of double bond.

For right carbon: COOCH3 and H, and part of the double bond.

But in reality, considering trans configuration, the structure should be where the two carbons in the double bond are each connected to COOCH3 and H, but as trans, the H on one carbon is opposite the COOCH3 on the adjacent.

So each carbon of the double bond has:

Left C: –COOCH3 (group 1), –H (group 2), and two single bonds to adjacent C. Oh Wait, double bonds take two bonds. Actually. In fumaric acid, it's HOOC—CH=CH—COOH, so each carbonyl carbon is adjacent to the double bond.

But actually, this structure has each end as a carboxylic acid. So if the fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH (trans), the esterification would replace the hydroxyls with OCH3.

So the structure is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, with the double bond trans.

So each carbon in the double bond (C and C) has:

Left C in the double bond is attached to the left COOCH3 and a hydrogen.

Right C in the double bond is attached to the right COOCH3 and a hydrogen.

But trans refers to the arrangement of the substituents around the double bond. Hence: the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So,

        COOCH3  
          \  
           C=C  
          /  
        COOCH3

But with both substituents (COOCH3) on opposite sides.

Now, for optical isomerism, there must be a chiral center. Do any of the carbons in this compound have four different substituents? Let's check all relevant carbons.

Looking at the ester groups:

The carbonyl carbons (those in COOCH3): each is bonded to two oxygens (one doubly bonded, one single bonded to O) and two COOCH3 groups (Wait, no. The ester groups are connected via the double bond:

The full structure:

 Structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C  
     /
O-C-OCH3

So each ester groups is O=C-OCH3 connected via CH=CH. So, except for the double bond carbons:

Each of the double bond carbons (the central two) is connected to an oxygen group (through the C=O ester) and a hydrogen. Wait, hold on:

Wait, in total, each carbon of the double bond in dimethyl fumarate is bonded to:

Carbon 2 (left of the double bond):

- One bond to COOCH3 (from the left ester group).

- One bond to CH (double bonded to carbon 3).

- And the other two bonds are to two hydrogen atoms? But ethylene is a double bond, each C is bonded to two things. Wait, but in reality, after the ester groups:

Wait, pulling_IUPAC structure: Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,4-dioxy-2-butenedioate, but no, the correct IUPAC name is dimethyl (E)-but-2-enedioate.

The structure is:

 Ester groups (OCH3) are at positions 1 and 4, and the double bond is at position 2 (but-2-ene), leading to the E configuration.

Thus, structure:

Positioning:

1 - COOCH3

2 - CH₂

But wait, proper-daily structure for but-2-enedioate: COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3.

But with the trans configuration. So that's where perhaps each C participating in the double bond (C2 and C3) has one COOCH3 group? No, but in but-2-enedioate, but structure would be:

O||C-OCH3 –CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3||O

No, wait, but-2-enedioate would have the double bond between C2 and C3.

Hence, structure:

COOCH3 is at C1 and C4 of but-2-ene.So almost:

COOCH3 – C(=CH2)–CH2 – COOCH3? Confused.

Wait, but that's not structurally accurate. To visualize properly:

But-2-enedioic acid would be HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH. But it's not that; waits error. No, the correct acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH (different carbon numbering when double bond is present). But-2-enedioic acid: positions 1 and 4 are the carboxylic acids, and between is CH=CH.

So, dimethyl fumarate's structure:

After esterification of oxygen's hydrogen with methyl groups, structure is OCH3OOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOCH3 but with a double bond between the central CH₂.

No, the correct structure is trans (E) configuration between the two ester groups.

Wait, in a butenedioic acid like fumaric acid, which is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid, structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH (trans configuration). Thus, the dimethyl ester would be OOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the double bond in trans.

Each carbon in the double bond (CH=CH):

Left Ch is attached to COOCH3 and one H.

Right CH is attached to COOCH3 and one H.

But since it's trans, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the left CH has 1 COOCH3 and 1 H. The right CH has 1 COOCH3 and 1 H.

But you need four different substituents for a chiral center. Let's check all the carbons. Starting from the left:

- The carbons in the COOCH3 groups: these are attached to two oxygen atoms, a methyl group (OCH3), and a central carbon. The carbonyl carbons here are double bonded to oxygen, and single bonded to OCH3 and the adjacent C. Hence, their substituents are: double bond O, OCH3, central (CH), but not four different groups. They don't contribute to chirality.

The central C atoms (the ones in the double bond). Each is attached to two carbons (adjacent via double bond) and two groups (COOCH3 and H). But if you have:

carbons in the double bond (C and C):

Each has:

Left carbon: COOCH3 on one side, H on the other, and double bonded to the right C. So attachments: COOCH3 and three times H? No. Wait, each double-bonded carbon has three substituents:

Actually, double bonded carbons each have:

For but-2-enedioate-dimethyl ester:

Positions:

1: COOCH3

2: C=CH-

3: CH-COOCH3

4: COOCH3

Wait isn’t that positions.

Actually, mapping the but-2-enedioate (four carbons), the numbering would be:

COOH-CH₂-CH₂-COOH → but changes if double bond. For but-2-enedioate: structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between carbon 2 and 3, so it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

Then methyl esterification yields CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The central double bond CH's:

Carbon 2: bonded to COOCH3 (left), and a double bond to C3 (CH).

Carbon 3: bonded to COOCH3 (right), and a double bond to C2 (CH).

But detail:

The two central carbons (2 and 3) each have:

Carbon 2: connected to COOCH3, the double bond (two bonds to C3), and two hydrogens?

Wait no. Which but those are in the double bond, which would use up two of the bonds. Hence:

Carbon 2: single bond to COOCH3 (C1), double bond to Carbon 3 (C=C), and one hydrogen.

Similarly, Carbon 3: single bond to COOCH3(C4), double bond to Carbon 2, and one hydrogen.

So each of the double bond carbons has:

Attachments:

Carbon 2:

- COOCH3 (from ester)

- C=C

- H

But carbon must have four bonds. Wait, twofold single bonds and one double bond. So for Carbon 2:

single bond to C1 (COOCH3),

double bond to C3,

and single bonds to two Hs? Because the double bond already connected to Carbon 3. Wait no:

If the structure is true but-2-enedioate, the bond between C2 and C3 is a double bond. Each of C2 and C3 are therefore sp² hybridized, have three substituents: C2 is connected to COOCH3, C3 (double bond), and one H. Similarly, C3 connected to COOCH3, C2 (double bond), and one H, in trans.

Hence, each double bond carbon has three substituents, making trigonal planar. Therefore, is that three groups: -COOCH3, -H, and a double bond. Wait but those only account for three bonds. A carbon must have four bonds. However, sp² hybridized carbons form three sigma bonds and one pi bond. So the double bond is one sigma and one pi. Hence, each carbons has three sigma bonds (COOCH3, H, and sigma bond toward the adjacent C) and the pi bond.

Therefore, those carbons each have three substituent groups attached (COOCH3, H, and C). So for chirality, each must have four different groups attached. Each of these carbons (C2 and C3) are each attached to three groups: a COOCH3, a H, and a C (because of the double bond). However, each adjacent C (C2 - C3) is in a double bond, so in terms of substituents, does that count as two groups? For example, does C2 see C3 as a substituent in counting? 

Wait to check if it's a chiral center:

A carbon can only be a chiral center if it has four distinct groups.

If C2 has connected groups: COOCH3, H, and a double bond (but how is that counted). Alternatively, considering organizations of atoms:

In reality, Carbon 2 is bonded to:

COOCH3 group,

H,

and two bonds (double bond) to C3.

But in valence terms, each carbon in the double bond has three substituents (the two adjacent atoms and the double bond). However, for chirality, maybe this is structured such that the double bond doesn't introduce symmetry.

But regardless, in dimethyl fumarate:

Both double bond carbons (C2 and C3) each are attached to:

- COOCH3 (left for C2, right for C3)

- H

- and a double bond (Left side for C2) (But not adjacent groups). 

Wait, maybe an easier way: 

Type of isomerism.

Alternatively, optical isomerism can also come from the molecule having no plane of symmetry, allowing for non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). So, perhaps even with no chiral center, but perhaps with a different type of chirality. But I don't think dimethyl fumarate has axial chirality.

But assuming no other form of chirality, so checking for chiral centers. Let's recheck methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Earlier conclusion: in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H, so four different substituents. Therefore, it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also known as methyl lactate?) – would exhibit optical isomerism.

Meanwhile, dimethyl fumarate:

If it has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical and planar.

Dimethyl fumarate is diest er of trans-dioic acid, symmetric in structure. OnTrans configuration, the structure has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the double bond, so the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, even if substituents were different, when model.

But in this case, both substituents on the double bond are the same (each double bond carbon has COOCH3 and H), so the substance is not chiral. However, due to the trans arrangement, however symmetry willaho create a plane of symmetry making the to mirror images superimposable.

But alternatively, if the two esters are arranged trans to each other, under which the molecule has a center of inversion. Hence, the molecule is meso or not?

Wait, no, meso compounds have multiple chiral centers and a plane of symmetry. If there are no chiral centers, then that does not apply. Dimethyl fumarate, in this case, the double bond is between carbons each attached to COOCH3 and H. But if the two COOCH3s are on opposite sides (trans), then the molecule is symmetric about the center of the double bond. Therefore, it is achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituens (COOCH3 and H) were different on each carbon of the double bond that would lead to a possibility of cis-trans isomerism which might lead to different properties, but here the substituents are the same (on each carbon. Wait, each carbon is connected to COOCH3 and H, but in the trans form, COOCH3 and H are opposite. But I must:

Imagine the dimethyl fumarate molecule as eine structure:

Looking top-down: the central C=C. On the left carbon (of the C=C), the substituents are COOCH3 upwards and H downwards. On the right carbon, substituents are COOCH3 downwards and H upward (due to trans configuration). But for-check less symmetry.

In such a case, around the double bond:

   COOCH3
     \
      C=C
     /   \
    H     H
   (and some other groups?)

Wait no, maybe highly detailed.

But with accurate structure, each carbon C=C substituents (on left and right):

Left C has:

COOCH3 (upper), H (lower), and the right C bonded via double bond.

Right C has:

COOCH3 (lower), H (upper), and bond the left C.

Because it's trans, so these are opposite. Therefore, the substituents aren't skewing.

Now, mirror the molecule. If you draw the molecule's mirror image, you can overlap it with a 180-degree rotation in the plane of the paper. Since the substituents are mirrored but also across a plane of symmetry, the mirror image would superimpose onto the original molecule. Hence the molecule is Achiral.

Hence, despite being a trans double bond, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical activity. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does Not show optical isomerism.

Whereas methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (considering the structure I somewhat clarified) does have a chiral center. Therefore, option B (which isomer shows optical activity) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Alternatively, some relookup might be cofoundingmers but wait aged.

But wait, let me verify (Name):

But wait, another substructure point: the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Alternatively, sometimes, structure could vary with numbering. For example: under normal IUPAC rules, the ester suffix is named by replacing "-ic acid" with "-ate", and O uses the lowest locant. The carbonyl group gets priority in numbering.

In propanoate, the principal chain is three carbons, with the COOCH3 at the end. Then substituting hydroxy group.

Thus, correct IUPAC name: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The hydroxy group is on the second carbon ( middle carbon) in the propionate.

Hence, ORIENTation:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

Thus, the central Carbon (2) has:

–COO–OCH3 group (from the first carbon),

–OH group,

–CH3 (third carbon),

and a single bond to the central carbon (which is just a hydrogen from OH还不了？

No: to recap **structure of central carbon** (carbon 2):

It's attached to:

1. COOCH3 (from carbon 1, which is the ester group)

2. OH (hydroxyl group)

3. CH3 (from carbon 3)

4. A hydrogen.

Thus, four different groups—yes, this creates a chiral center, hence optical isomerism.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should have enantiomers.

Hence, answer for part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Summary:

(A) Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

(B) Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

So the answers are A: benzoquinone, B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about two pairs of compounds. For the first pair, benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, we need to determine which one does not show tautomerism (which they're calling compound A). Then, for the second pair, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, we need to find out which one shows optical isomerism (compound B). Alright, let's start with the first part.

Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where compounds can rapidly interconvert between isomers via the migration of a proton, usually accompanied by a switch in the position of a double bond. Common types are keto-enol tautomerism, which involves the transfer of a hydrogen between a carbonyl group (keto form) and an alcohol (enol form). So, for a compound to exhibit tautomerism, it should have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) adjacent to a carbon with a hydrogen (alpha hydrogen), allowing for the keto-enol shift. Let's analyze both compounds in the first pair.

Benzoquinone. Wait, there are different benzoquinones depending on the positions of the carbonyl groups. The common ones are 1,2-benzoquinone (ortho) and 1,4-benzoquinone (para). But given the name just as benzoquinone, I think it's typically the 1,4 isomer that's referred to. Benzoquinone has a benzene ring with two ketone (carbonyl) groups in the para positions. Structure-wise, each carbonyl is at opposite ends. Now, can this undergo keto-enol tautomerism?

For keto-enol tautomerism, having a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl is necessary. But in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to two oxygens otherwise. Wait, benzoquinone's structure is O=C6H4=O (para). Wait, each ketone is a ring carbonyl. So, in that structure, the carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic ring? Wait, no. In quinones, the carbonyls are part of the conjugated system but not in the same way as in benzene. For example, cyclohexane-1,4-dione is a diketone with carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. But benzoquinone is a conjugated carbonyl system. Let me draw this mentally. The benzoquinone (para) structure is a benzene ring where two of the CH groups are replaced with carbonyl groups. So, like O=C-C6H4-C(=O)-, but arranged para. The carbonyl groups are adjacent to aromatic carbons not bearing hydrogens. Wait, actually, benzoquinone gets rid of two double bonds in the benzene ring for the quinone structure. The standard structure of para-benzoquinone has two ketone groups on the benzene ring in para positions, right? So, hydrocarbons adjacent to the carbonyls in the ring. Now, the alpha carbons to the carbonyls here would be the adjacent carbons in the ring. However, in para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to two adjacent carbons of the ring. Wait, the actual structure is a ring with six members, alternate single and double bonds, with two carbonyl groups opposite each other, such that they are part of the conjugated system. Hence, each carbonyl group is connected to the ring carbons with double bonds adjacent. Wait maybe:

Structure would be:

O=C–C–C=C–C–C(=O)

Arranged in a six-membered ring. But I'm not sure if that's accurate, perhaps the exact positions matter. Wait, the standard para-benzoquinone structure has two ketone groups on the ring in 1,4 positions. The adjacent carbonyl groups would have CH2 positions if it's in cyclohexene, but actually, in para-benzoquinone, the arrangement is aromatic-like, but in benzenoid structure with two ketone groups. The key question for tautomerism is if there's a hydrogen atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group that can deprotonate to form an enol.

But in benzoquinone, are there alpha hydrogens? Let's see. Each carbonyl is on a carbon attached to two other carbons (since in a ring) but is there a hydrogen on that carbon? Wait, in the quinone structure, the carbonyl groups are on carbons that are next to carbons that are part of the conjugated double bonds. Let me think about the specifics. Benzoquinone is a cyclohexadienedione. So cyclohexene with two ketones. Let’s look at structure:

In 1,4-cyclohexadienedione, which is para-benzoquinone. So there’s a six-membered ring with two ketone oxygens opposite each other. The carbons with the ketone groups (positions 1 and 4) are each double-bonded to an oxygen. The adjacent carbons (2,3,5,6) should have double bonds in the ring. So the structure is alternating. Wait, the actual structure would have conjugated double bonds between C1-C2 (if C1 is the ketone at position 1) and between C3-C4 (but C4 is another carbonyl?), maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe only one conjugated system. Hmm, maybe I should visualize benzoquinone's molecular structure properly. Alternatively, let's take benzoquinone as a benzene ring with two oxygen substituents in the para positions, each in the form of carbonyl groups (–C=O). So, the carbons with the carbonyl groups are each connected to the oxygen and to two adjacent carbons of the benzene ring. In that case, these carbons (1 and 4) would not have any hydrogens, because each is bonded to the oxygen (double bond, so no H) and to the ring carbons, which only in the benzene would have H; but those carbons (1 and 4) themselves: Can a carbon with a carbonyl group (C=O) have hydrogen attached?

Wait, carbonyl groups are typically R-C=O, where the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, and single-bonded to R (another carbon) and so that carbon (the carbonyl carbon) doesn't have any hydrogens. For example, in acetone, (CH3)2CO, the carbonyl carbon has two CH3 groups and a double bond to O, no H. Therefore, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl carbons (positions 1 and 4) are each double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two carbons of the aromatic ring.

Given this, those carbonyl carbons (positions 1 and 4 in para) are fully substituted with two aromatic ring carbons and a double bond to O, so no hydrogen atoms. Therefore, those positions cannot undergo enol tautomerism because there's no alpha hydrogen (H on the adjacent carbon). Wait, keto-enol tautomerism happens when there's an alpha hydrogen to the carbonyl group. If there's no hydrogen on the adjacent carbons, tautomerism can't occur.

But wait maybe I should double-check. The carbonyl group is in the para position. For enol tautomerism, the alpha carbon (the one next to carbonyl) must have a hydrogen. The substituents on the benzene ring attached to the carbonyl, those carbons are part of the ring. But in para-benzoquinone, the only substituents are the O groups. So the carbonyl carbons are parts of the ring structure where they are connected via conjugated double bonds. Let me state this again: In benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at a position where their adjacent carbons are in a conjugated double bond.

Wait, perhaps I am overcomplicating. Let's think: enol form requires a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. If in benzoquinone there are no hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups, then it can't have keto-enol tautomerism. But if there's a hydrogen, it can. How do the adjacent carbons look like?

Assuming a benzene ring with two carbonyl groups (as in para), each carbonyl would be at positions 1 and 4. The structure would be O=C-aryl-C(=O), with the rest of the ring's double bonds. But each carbonyl group is on two adjacent carbons? Wait no. Let's model benzene (a six-carbon ring).

If positions 1 and 4 have ketone groups. Then, structure would be:

C1=O connected to C2 and C6.

C4=O connected to C3 and C5.

In between, the double bonds would be C2-C3 and C5-C6, perhaps. Then, carbons 2,3,5,6 each have one double bond and two single bonds. Then, adjacent to the carbonyl C1 is C2 and C6. Are there hydrogens on C2 and C6 here? If the ring has normal alternating double bonds (i.e., ortho positions with double bonds and para with ketone groups) then actual positions may have double bonds between C1 and C2 (but no, if C1 is a carbonyl carbon?), hmm no. Wait, maybe the structure is:

C1 is double-bonded to O (so C=O)

The benzene ring then has double bonds between C2-C3 and C4-C5 (since para is positions 1 and 4), but this seems confusing. Alternatively, in para-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4. These are sentolecule, so the ring has two double bonds adjacent to each carbonyl. Let me search... Actually, it's known that quinones are fully conjugated, so perhaps each carbonyl group is conjugated into the ring. But benzene suppresses keto-enol tautomerism because the conjugated structure is more stable. Alternatively, if the ring's carbonyls have adjacent double bonds, those might lock them into the keto form. Alternatively, without alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but another thought. If a molecule has no enolizable hydrogens (alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl group), then it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

In benzoquinone, specifically, let's say the position is:

Each carbonyl carbon (C1 and C4) is part of a conjugated system. Are there any hydrogens on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl carbons?

In para-quinone, each of the two carbonyl carbons (C1 and C4) are attached to two adjacent carbons (so C1 is bonded to C2 and C6, and C4 is bonded to C3 and C5). If the double bonds in the ring are between C2-C3 and C5-C6, then each of those carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) would have one double bond and one single bond in the ring. Now, do those carbons have hydrogens? In the quinone structure, most likely, each ring carbon adjacent to the carbonyl groups is double-bonded to another carbon. In other words, C2 is double-bonded to C3, s

# Anthropic completion

I'll approach this problem methodically. First, I need to analyze two compound pairs to identify which one in the first pair doesn't exhibit tautomerism (compound A) and which one in the second pair demonstrates optical isomerism (compound B).

Let me begin with the tautomerism question. Tautomerism involves rapid interconversion between isomers through proton migration, typically accompanied by a double bond position change. The keto-enol tautomerism is common, requiring a carbonyl group adjacent to a carbon bearing a hydrogen (alpha hydrogen).

For the first pair, I need to examine benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Regarding benzoquinone, I should determine its structure. Typically, when simply called "benzoquinone," it refers to 1,4-benzoquinone (para-benzoquinone). This compound has a six-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 4, and double bonds between positions 2-3 and 5-6.

To undergo keto-enol tautomerism, the alpha carbons (adjacent to the carbonyl) must have hydrogen atoms. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl carbon is connected to two ring carbons as part of the conjugated system. The critical question is whether these adjacent carbons have hydrogens that could participate in tautomerism.

The structure of para-benzoquinone has carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4, with each carbonyl carbon bonded to two other carbons in the ring. These carbons form part of a conjugated system with alternating single and double bonds. I need to determine if the positions adjacent to the carbonyl groups have hydrogens that could be transferred in keto-enol tautomerism.

In a typical para-benzoquinone structure, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl would be connected via double bonds within the conjugated system. If these adjacent carbons lack hydrogen atoms, then benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism, as this process requires hydrogen atoms in the alpha position to the carbonyl group.

The absence of alpha hydrogens would prevent benzoquinone from exhibiting tautomerism, as there would be no hydrogen available for the proton transfer that's essential for the keto-enol interconversion.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's try to break down this problem methodically. The question involves two pairs of compounds, and for each pair, we need to identify specific characteristics.

First, let's consider the pair of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Our task is to determine which compound does not exhibit tautomerism, referred to as compound A. Tautomerism is an isomerism type where compounds can swiftly switch between isomers through proton migration, generally linked with changes in the position of a double bond. A typical example is keto-enol tautomerism, where a hydrogen shifts between a carbonyl group (keto form) and an alcohol (enol form). For tautomerism to occur, a compound should have a carbonyl group adjacent to a carbon with a hydrogen (an alpha hydrogen), permitting a keto-enol transition. Let's evaluate these parameters for both compounds in the first pair.

Now, concerning benzoquinone. There are various types of benzoquinones, depending on where the carbonyl groups are positioned, with 1,2-benzoquinone (ortho) and 1,4-benzoquinone (para) being common. Generally, when benzoquinone is mentioned, it refers to the 1,4 isomer. Benzoquinone consists of a benzene ring with two ketone groups at the para positions. In terms of structure, each carbonyl is at opposite ends. The question is: can this compound undergo keto-enol tautomerism?

For keto-enol tautomerism to take place, there should be an alpha hydrogen next to a carbonyl group. However, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to two oxygen atoms. Observing the structure, the carbonyl groups are part of a conjugated system rather than a classic aromatic benzene due to the removal of two double bonds. In the para-benzoquinone setup, the benzene ring has ketone groups replacing two CH groups. Therefore, the carbonyl groups, positioned at para, are part of a fully conjugated system without alpha hydrogens.

The diketone structure of para-benzoquinone means it formats a six-membered ring with alternate single and double bonds, with two carbonyl groups, ensuring these carbonyl positions have no adjacent hydrogens due to their bonding with ring carbons. Since the carbonyl carbons (1 and 4 positions) are bonded with double bonds to oxygen and single bonds to the aromatic ring carbons, consisting of double-bond arrangements, no hydrogen atoms are present on these carbons. Consequently, para-benzoquinone does not have the necessary hydrogens to undergo enol tautomerism.

Tautomerism necessitates alpha hydrogens, and in this structure, none exist.

Now, let's consider the second pair of compounds: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Here, we need to determine which one exhibits optical isomerism, identified as compound B. Firstly, optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, allowing for non-superimposable mirror images, otherwise known as enantiomers.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the presence of a chiral center can arise from the configuration of carbon atoms surrounding it. Evaluating this compound will reveal its potential for optical isomerism. Conversely, dimethyl fumarate features a straightforward structure without chiral centers, typically leading it not to display optical isomerism.

Given the conditions for optical isomerism, we can further analyze the structure of these molecules to conclusively determine which one fully complies with exhibiting optical isomerism properties.

Now these adjacent carbons (2, 6 for 1 and 3,5 for 4):\n\nFor example, carbonyl at C1 is bonded to C2 and C6, which are part of double bonds (C2-C3 and C5-C6). So, whether does C2 or C6 have hydrogens?\n\nIn the structure cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione, the double bonds are at 2-3 and 5-6, making the ring a conjugated cyclohexadiene. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls (C2, C6 for C1, and C3, C5 for C4) are each part of double bonds. So the carbons adjacent to carbonyls:\n\nCarbon C2 – double bond between C2-C3, and adjacent to C1 (which is a carbonyl).\n\nBecause of the double bond, each of those carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) would only have two substituents (double bond and two single bonds). But in reality, each of them is attached to two carbons (part of the ring) and a hydrogen if possible.\n\nWait, let me think about the hybridization. Each of the double bond carbons (e.g., C2 and C3) are sp² hybridized, each has three bonds: the double bond, and two single bonds to adjacent carbons (C1 and C4 for C2?), then how? Wait, if the quinone structure is a six-membered ring with C1 as a carbonyl (O=C), then connected to C2 and C6; C2 is connected to C1 and C3 (double bond C2-C3); and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps each carbonyl group is in positions 1 and 4, and the ring has double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6, leaving C1 connected to C2 and C6 via single bonds. But if C1 is a carbonyl, then C1 is double bonded to O, and single bonded to C2 and C6 for a six-membered ring. Similarly, C4 is O=C, connected to C3 and C5.\n\nIn this case, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (C2 and C6 for O=C1; C3 and C5 for O=C4) are each sp² hybridized (since part of a double bond in the ring? Wait, if C2 is connected to C3 via a double bond, then C2 would have three substituents: C1, C3 (double bond), and possibly a hydrogen.\n\nWait, carbonyl group is O=C1-, connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected via double bond to C3, and C6 is connected via single bond to C5. No, wait, let me find the actual structure:\n\nThe correct structure of 1,4-benzoquinone is as cyclohexadienedione. Positions 1 and 4 are double bonded to oxygen. So the ring would have single bonds except for the two double bonds at positions 2-3 and 5-6, and the two carbonyl groups at 1 and 4. But in that scenario, positions 1 and 4 are connected via single bonds to adjacent carbons and double bonded to oxygen. Then, the carbons adjacent to carbonyl carbons (C1 is next to C2 and C6): is C2 part of a double bond (between C2-C3). Therefore, C2 is sp² hybridized, with bonds to C1 (single), C3 (double), and perhaps a hydrogen. Similarly, C6 is connected to C1 (single), C5 (double?), and C7? No, this seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps C6 is connected via a single bond to C5 and to C7 (but there are only six carbons in the ring. Confusion arises.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the benzoquinone does not have any hydrogen on the carbons adjacent to carbonyl, thereby making keto-enol tautomerism impossible. Because in such a conjugated system, the carbonyl groups are locked into position, but their adjacent carbons don\'t have hydrogens because the quinone is fully conjugated and already stabilized. But perhaps tautomerism in such a system would disrupt aromaticity, so it won\'t happen. Wait, but quinones are generally not aromatic because of the conjugated carbonyls disrupting the aromatic sextet. But even so, if there are no alpha hydrogens, there can be no tautomerism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can do. Let\'s look at the structure for that. It\'s a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at 1, 3, and 5 positions. So, it\'s symmetrical. So, each ketone is separated by two carbons. Each ketone group is O=C-R. Now, the carbons adjacent to each ketone (the alpha carbons) would possess hydrogen. Since the ketones are in 1,3,5 positions, the each ketone is two carbons apart. Let\'s think of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That would have three keto groups in a cyclohexane ring. So, positions 1, 3, 5 each have a carbonyl group. So each of those is like, substituted on the cyclohexane, which is a six-membered ring all single bonds. So each ketal? No, each ketone. So, cyclohexane has three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5.\n\nSo, if cyclohexane is a chair, for instance, with ketones at 1,3,5.\n\nAlternatively, flat structure. So ketone groups at each alternate position. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (presumably beta to the cyclohexane ring) – but in this molecule, the structure would be something like O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-CO. Not quite. Wait, but in reality, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a ring with three ketone groups.\n\nKeerthi. If cyclohexane has ketone groups in 1,3,5 positions, each carbonyl is on a separate carbon. Then the groups would be O=C-(CH2) etc. Wait, for example, position 1 is O=C, then positions 2 and 6 are CH2, then position 3 is O=C, and so on. No, since replacing three CH2 groups with ketones.\n\nWait, the actual carbons in the cyclohexane ring are in a chair? Presumably in 1,3,5-tricyclohexane. If the cyclohexane is in chair conformation, but with ketone groups. But the key here is that each ketone (at position 1,3,5), has adjacent carbons (ie. positions 2 and 6 for ketone 1, positions 4 and 2 for ketone 3, etc.). Do those adjacent positions have alpha hydrogens?\n\nIf each ketone is attached to the cyclohexane carbon via a single bond (as in the cyclohexane is substituted with three CO groups), wait, but the carbonyl would be attached via a single bond. Therefore, each ketone carbonyl carbon would be O=C-R, where R is the cyclohexane carbon. So, the adjacent carbons would still have hydrogens, like R-CO, so in this case, the carbons adjacent to the ketones (which are the carbons next door in the ring) would have hydrogens.\n\nBut wait, if each ketone is on a geminal position, but in the cyclohexane, attaching to each other, how\'s the structure? Maybe 1,3,5-triketocyclohexane. Each ketone group has substituents adjacent, perhaps leading to enolization for tautomerism.\n\nBut think of each ketone in the cyclohexane trione. Each ketone carbon is part of the cyclohexane ring. Wait, this starts to not make sense. If the cyclohexane ring has ketones at 1,3,5 then those would be CO groups connected via single bonds to the ring carbons. Wait, in normal notation, 1,3,5-tricyclohexanone would mean three ketone groups connected to the cyclohexane ring at positions 1,3,5. Each ketone exists as a carbonyl group (C=O). So, each of those carbons (at positions 1,3,5)) are now carbonyl carbons (i.e., they can\'t have any hydrogens themselves), but the adjacent carbons (positions 2,6 for ketone 1; 2,4 for ketone3; 4, 6 for ketone5) would have hydrogens. Therefore, each ketone has adjacent carbons (alpha carbons) with hydrogens (H) which can potentially enolize.\n\nTherefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the ketone groups have adjacent (alpha) hydrogens. Enolization would involve the alpha hydrogen shifting to the carbonyl oxygen. However, andrea: benzoquinone does not have enolizable alpha hydrogens? Seems earlier analysis suggest in benzoquinone, the alpha carbons (adjacent to C=O) do not have hydrogens because they are part of double bonds or aromatic systems. That being the case, benzoquinone cannot tautomerize, while the cyclohexane trione can. Therefore, compound A (the one that does not show tautomerism) is benzoquinone.\n\nTherefore, the answer for the first part (A) is benzoquinone.\n\nNow moving to part B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs dimethyl fumarate for optical isomerism.\n\nOptical isomerism (enantiomerism) occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (or an axis/plane of chirality) – i.e., a carbon atom with four different substituents. Alternatively, having a double bond (like allene) that allows for non-superimposable mirror images, but in general, optical isomerism most commonly arises from chiral centers.\n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: let\'s draw the structure. The parent acid would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (which is similar to lactic acid). Esterification with methyl groups. So the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure would be: O\n|\nO-CO-OCH3\n|\nCH3-C-OH\nWait, no. Wait, wait. The propanoate is propanoic acid ester. So to break it down: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CHOH-CH3 (if low numbering?), but I think the correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)-COOH. When esterified, the COOH becomes COOR. So methyl ester would be the acid\'s COOCH3.\n\nSo methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, propanoate has three carbons. The functional groups are the hydroxy at C2 and the ester at C1. The formula would be: the hydroxy is on the middle carbon (C2), the ester (COOCH3) is on C1, and CH3 is on C3. Wait, alternative, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be in the middle (CH2(OH)CH2COOH), but that\'s 3-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, no. If propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH with three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Therefore, 2-hydroxy is on the second carbon: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. So as an ester, the carboxylic acid part becomes an ester (COOCH3) and the rest remains. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-COO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to think in terms of IUPAC naming. Let me break it down: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nThe parent chain is propanoate (three carbons). The substituents are: a hydroxy on carbon 2 and a methyl ester. For propanoate, the ester group is on carbon 1 (that\'s the acid part where ester comes from). So the structure is O. Therefore, the propanoate ester would have the following structure: O\n||\nO-CO-OCH3\n|\nCH2-CHOH-CH3\n\nNo, that doesn\'t fit. Wait, the correct structure: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. To make the methyl ester, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So methyl propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. If it\'s 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the hydroxy is on the second carbon. Which gives: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but propanoate is three-carbon: the COOCH3 is on the first carbon, then the second carbon has a hydroxy group, making the molecule HO-CH2-COOCH3 (since HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 would have four carbons). Wait, maybe not. If "propanoate" is the ester derived from propanoic acid, which is:\n\nPropanoic acid: CH3CH2COOH\n\nSo propanoate: CH3CH2COO-R\n\nIf its methyl ester: CH3CH2COOCH3.\n\nIn "2-hydroxypropanoate," the acid would have a hydroxy group on the beta carbon (position 2 relative to the carboxylic acid), so the acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nWait, but another possibility. Maybe numbering differently. In propanoic acid, if the COOH is on carbon 1, the rest are carbons 2 and 3. So 2-hydroxy would be on carbon 2. So structure COOH-CH(OH)-CH3 for the acid. Then, methyl ester would be COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. So the ester is at the original COOH group (position 1), and hydroxy at position 2.\n\nNow, let\'s see: This would give the structure CH(CH3)(OH)COOCH3.\n\nTherefore, in this structure, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:\n\n- COOCH3 (carbonyl oxygen from COOCH3? Probably not, since positionally need to check.\n\nWait Hmmm, forming another perspective: structure would be:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-OCH3\n|\nCH(OH)(CH3)\n\nTherefore, the central carbon (the one attached to COOCH3) has which substituents?\n\nWait, if it\'s 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is HOOC-CHOH-CH3 as the acid (depending on numbering). Then the methyl ester would replace the hydrogen from the carboxylic acid. So methyl ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is O\n|\nO=C-OCH3\n|\nCH(OH)CH3\n\nOr:\nCOOCH3\n|\nCH(OH)CH3\n\nSo the ester (COOCH3) is on carbon 1, hydroxy (OH) on carbon 2, and methyl (CH3) on carbon 3.\n\nSo the molecule is (COOCH3)-C(OH)H-CH3. Therefore, the central carbon (carbon) or rather, the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group (carbon 2) has four substituents.\n\nLet me visualize:\n\nCarbon chain: COOCH3 - C(OH)(H) - CH3\n\nSo the central carbon (second carbon) has groups:\n\n- COOCH3 (ester group, but wait, no. Wait, correction. In propanoic acid, the first carbon is the carboxylic acid, second is methylene, third is methyl. So if converting to the ester, the propanoate ester is COOCH3-O to replace the -OH of the acid. Then, the 2-hydroxy would be on the adjacent carbon (COOCH3-CHOH-CH3). Wait, no:\n\nOH | COOCH3-CHOH-CH3. But how? Perhaps not. Where is the hydroxy group located?\n\nAlternative approach. Let\'s consider IUPAC nomenclature details. The name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nPropionates. Propanoate is the ester of propanoic acid, so the parent is propanoic acid. In propanoate ester, the structure is CH2CH2COO-R. The ester functionality is always on the first carbon (because carboxylic acids are numbered with the COOH as carbon 1). So the carboxylic acid group is on the first carbon. So if there\'s a substituent (hydroxyl) on the second carbon in the propanol ester, then the structure would be:\n\nCOOCH3 (carbon 1) - CH(OH) (carbon 2) - CH3 (carbon 3)\n\nThus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-OCH3\n|\nCH(OH)CH3\n\nSo, looking at the central carbon (carbon 2):\n\nAttached to:\n\n- Carbonyl oxygenated group (COOCH3 from carbon 1),\n- Hydroxyl group (OH),\n- Methyl group (CH3),\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nThus, the central carbon (carbon 2) would have four different substituents:\n\n- COOCH3 (from previous carbon, wait, wait no. Wait, carbon 2 is connected to:\n\nCarbon 1: which is the carbonyl group (COOCH3). So, carbon 2 must be connected via a single bond to carbon 1. Wait, but carbonyl is a double bond. Wait, perhaps I need to check again.\n\nPerhaps more correct skeletal structure:\n\nThe molecule would be:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-O-CH3 (carbon 1)\n|\nC(OH)(CH3)-CH3\n\nNo, the entire structure must have three carbons. So carbons are as follows:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group),\n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH),\n\nCarbon 3: CH3.\n\nTherefore, carbon 2 is connected to:\n\nCarbon 1 (COOCH3) via a single bond,\n\nHydroxy group (OH),\n\nA hydrogen,\n\nAnd a CH3 group.\n\nWait, but that can\'t be. Let me confirm once again.\n\nPropanoic acid: CH3-CH2-COOH.\n\nIf we make methyl ester: CH3-CH2-COOCH3.\n\nA hydroxy at position 2 would be on the CH2 group: CH2(OH)-.\n\nSo the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n\nAh, there we go. So that makes sense: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Therefore, carbon 2 (central carbon) would be the CH(OH) connected to the CH3 (carbon 3) and the COOCH3 (carbon 1), plus the OH and a hydrogen.\n\nSo substituents on carbon 2:\n\n- COOCH3 group (from carbon 1),\n\n- CH3 (carbon 3),\n\n- OH group,\n\n- and a hydrogen (so that\'s four substituents!).\n\nSo four different groups: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H (although H is a lone hydrogen). Wait, but, wait, when determining chirality, the substituents must all be different. Otherwise, not a chiral center.\n\nSo substituents on carbon 2:\n\nLooking at the actual structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3). The central carbon (the one with OH):\n\n1. -COOCH3 (left),\n\n2. -CH3 (right),\n\n3. -OH,\n\n4. -H (the rest).\n\nBut wait, in reality, maybe carbon 2 is the middle carbon: is the substituent order such that there are two methyl groups?\n\nNo, check:\n\nThe structure\'s formula is:\n\nO\n||\nCOOCH3     OH\n |        |\nCH3-C-CH3\n\nWait no, wait. The hydroxy is on the middle carbon. The actual structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3?\n\nNo. Wait, carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- one COOCH3 (from carbon 1, which is adjacent?)\n\nWait, key point: Propanoate is a three-carbon chain.\n\nCarbon 1: carboxy => MeOOC-\n\nCarbon 2: -\n\nCarbon 3: methyl.\n\nWith 2-hydroxy. So proper structure would be: O\n|\nCOOCH3-CHOH-CH3?\n\nWait, but that would put the HO-C-CH2 as:\n\nCarbonation:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (which is OCO OCH3?), carbon 2: CH(OH), carbon 3: CH3.\n\nWait, getting confused again. Hold on. Consider the propenoate fragment. Propanoate has three carbons. So:\n\n- The first carbon is the carbonyl: COOCH3 (from the original COOH esterified to methyl),\n\n- The second carbon is the next CH2,\n\n- The third carbon is the terminal CH3.\n\nWith a hydroxy substituent on the second carbon (in "2-hydroxypropanoate"), the structure would be:\n\nCOOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.\n\nThat is, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the formula CH2(OH) connected to central CH, linked to COOCH3 and CH3.\n\nSo the carbon chain is:\n\nO\n||\nO-C-OCH3    CH3\n    \\      /\n     C-OH\n\nDraw this. The central carbon is:\n\n    C\n   /|\\\nCOOCH3  CH3  OH\n   \\\n    H\n\nWait, but each bond here would have four bonds. Actually, the central carbon is attached to:\n\n- COOCH3 (which is (O)CO... but the carbonyl bond is at carbon 1, so carbon 2 (the central) is a CH group.\n\nWait, I\'m still confused. Let\'s establish by formula. The formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the three carbons: COOCH3-(CH(OH))-(CH3). The middle carbon, CH(OH), is attached to COOCH3, CH3, OH, and a hydrogen. OH is a substituent here, so the four substituents on the central carbon are:\n\n1. COOCH3 (a group with structure O-CO-OCH3),\n\n2. CH3,\n\n3. OH,\n\n4. H.\n\nWell, unless structure interpretation is such that there\'s another substituent, but of the four, COOCH3 is a chain (O-C-O-), but in reality, the central carbon (second carbon of the ester) has:\n\n- COOCH3 ( methyl ester carbonyl group),\n\n- OH ( hydroxyl group),\n\n- Two other substituents: methyl (CH3) and hydrogen.\n\nWait, maybe the COOCH3 is just a single group (so substituent is O-CO-OCH3), and then The central carbon is attached to OH, a methyl, and two more groups from the chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to draw:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 group,\n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH) with attachments to C1 and C3,\n\nCarbon 3: CH3.\n\nSo Carbon 2 is connected to:\n\nFrom COOCH3 (C1), which replaces a hydrogen on the central carbon:\n\nWait, this is getting too confused. Alternatively, symbolically: the structure can be represented as O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. Thus, the middle carbon (between COOCH3 and CH3) has the substituents:\n\n- O=C(OCH3) (from left), assuming the chain is arranged as C=O(ester), but no, maybe:\n\nBut wait, if the structure is propanoate, the chain must have three carbons. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:\n\nIt’s derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid), which has a hydroxyl on the second carbon (natural configuration is similar to lactic acid where we have HOOC-CHOH-CH3, but and the ester would be OCH3 instead of OH).\n\nWait, lactic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH (IUPAC: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid). Its methyl ester would be replacing the -COOH\'s OH with OCH3, giving CH3-CH-O-CO-OCH3? No: ester of propanoic acid, methyl ester would have the structure MeOOC-CHOH-CH3. Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Thus, the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3, 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? I must need to clarify.\n\nThe official IUPAC name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate implies:\n\nThe main chain has three carbons (propanoate), with the ester group on the first carbon (since propanoate comes from propanoic acid, -anoate indicating the first carbon is the carboxylate), and a hydroxy substituent on the second carbon.\n\nThus, the structure is....\n\n1    2         3\nCOOCH3-CHOH-CH3\n\nSo first carbon is the carboxylate ester (COOCH3), second is CH with OH and CH3 adjacent (maybe). Then third is CH3.\n\nBut thus, carbon 2 is connected to COOCH3 (C1), CH3 (C3), OH, and a hydrogen (if the structure is COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. Hence, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:\n\n- COOCH3 group (C1),\n- CH3 (C3),\n- OH,\n- And a hydrogen.\n\nThese are four different substituents: a methyl ester group, a methyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a hydrogen. Therefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center. Hence, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and hence can exhibit optical isomerism (enantiomers).\n\nOn the other hand, dimethyl fumarate: structure. Fumarate is the trans isomer of dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylate. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid (HOOC-CH₂-CH₂- COOH), but wait no, no. Fumaric acid is trans-1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. Wait, greater accuracy.\n\nFumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is trans-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in the \'trans\' configuration. The esters of this would replace both carboxylic groups with ester moieties. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, with the double bond in the trans configuration. So structure: O\n\n   ||\nO-C-OCH3\n    \\\n     C=C\n    / \nO-C-OCH3\n   ||\n\n(ignoring exact placement of double bonds and substituents, but in trans). However, this structure will have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond (recall fumarate is trans).\n\nThis molecule, dimethyl fumarate, doesn\'t have any chiral centers. Because each carbon adjacent to the double bond has two identical ester groups (on opposite sides). The carbons at the ends (each attached to COOCH3) would each be bonded to identical groups: a COOCH3 group, a CH group (the other end of the double bond), and two R groups (which would need to be same for non-chirality). Wait, actually, if it\'s dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, structure is (Z) or (E). Wait, fumarate is the E isomer (trans).\n\nThe structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH becomes incorrect. Wait, fumarate is butenedioate. So butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH is succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, the trans version. So, dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 in trans configuration.\n\nNow, analyzing the structure:\n\n\\-OOCR1- and -OOCR1 can only be C=C. So otherwise, migrating between the carbons. Now, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups: a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. Wait, wait. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:\n\n    COOCH3\n    |\nCH2=C-CH2\n    |\n    COOCH3\n\nNo, wait no. No, actually, dimethyl fumarate is di-Ester of (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. Structure is O\n\nThe correct formula is of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl but-2-enedioate.\n\nBut-2-enedioate: the two carboxylate groups are at the two ends of the molecule on carbons 1 and 4 (if but-2-ene). So arranged as:\nCH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3)?\n\nWait, no, but-2-enedioic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with double bond between CH₂ and CH₂? Wait, but fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So but-2-enedioic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but its double bond is at position 2. Wait, no, that\'s actually succinic acid. Wait, perhaps confusion arises. Let me correct. but-2-enedioic acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH ? No, adding a double bond.\n\nNo, to do but-2-enedioic acid, position 2 would be between carbons 2 and 3 (for four carbons):\n\nBut-2-enedioic acid structure: HOOC–CH2–CH₂–COOH with double bond between C2-C3? Wait, with a dioic acid groups at ends:\n\nFor but-2-enedioic acid:\n\nNumbering the carbons:\n\n1    2     3    4\n\nHOOC-C= C-COOH\n\nBut it\'s E (trans) isomer. So the correct structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond at positions 2-3 (but-2-enedioic acid), which isfumaric acid. Thus, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,4-dioxy-2-enedioic acid, dimethyl ester. I think structure is more specifically:\n\nCOOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3 (trans)\n\nIn trans configuration, the two carboxy groups are on opposite sides. Hence, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,4-dioxy-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester. Therefore, each CH in the double bond (carbons 2 and 3) is attached to:\n\n- a COOCH3,\n- a hydrogen.\n\nWait, for the carbons in the double bond (each having two substituent):\n\nIn (E) configuration:\nLeft side: COOCH3 and H on carbon 2.\nRight side: COOCH3 and H on carbon 3.)\n\nBut which one is E. Wait, with both COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. Hence, each double bond carbon has COOCH3 and H, so no chiral centers. Each double bond carbon is attached to only two different groups (since in E configuration, they are opposite). Each carbon in the trans double bond has one COOCH3 and one H, but that gives each double bond carbon:\n\nWait. For carbon 2:\n- bonded to COOCH3,\n- bonded to H,\n- bonded to double bond (counts as two bonds).\nWait, wait, that can\'t be. If it\'s a double bond between C2 and C3, each has to have two substituents. Let\'s imagine you have carbonyls at C1 and C4:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3\n\nCarbon 2: CH..\n\nCarbon 3: CH..\n\nCarbon 4: COOCH3\n\nBut stuck—actually, i don\'t think an acetate (CH2) unit satisfies. Wait, correct once and for all.\n\nFumarate is stabilizes trans-1,2-diolato? No. Fumaric acid simplifies:\n\nProp-like this: HOOC–CH=CH–COOH\n\nDi-acid.\n\nBookoo experience in dertermining the structure, perhaps it’s actually the Achy the central two carbons (each double bond carbons) have each:\n\n one COOH (or COOCH3 for th’ester), and one CH adjacent.

To determine which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which one shows optical isomerism (B), we analyze the given pairs of compounds:

1. **Benzoquinone vs. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione (Tautomerism):**
   - **Benzoquinone (para-benzoquinone)** has two carbonyl groups in the para positions on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (alpha carbons) are part of the conjugated aromatic system and do not have hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism is not possible.
   - **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione** has three carbonyl groups in a cyclohexane ring. Each carbonyl group is adjacent to carbons with hydrogens (alpha carbons), allowing for keto-enol tautomerism.
   - **Conclusion:** Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs. Dimethyl Fumarate (Optical Isomerism):**
   - **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** has the structure CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH₃), a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃), and a hydrogen (-H). This creates a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.
   - **Dimethyl Fumarate** is the trans (E) isomer of butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trans configuration of the ester groups around the double bond, resulting in no chiral centers and hence no optical isomerism.
   - **Conclusion:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer

The compound that does not show tautomerism is \boxed{benzoquinone} (A), and the compound that shows optical isomerism is \boxed{methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate} (B).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

nd C5 is double-bonded to C6, meaning those carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) would have one single bond and one double bond. Wait, that leaves them with two substituents (adjacent single bonds and double bonds), that is:

Assuming the structure for para-benzoquinone:

Positions (1: C=O), 2 (CH), 3 (CH), 4 (C=O), 5 (CH), 6 (CH).

But with double bonds between 1-2, 3-4, 5-6? Wait, no, since alernating then. Hmm, maybe this is getting too ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the correct structure has two rings. Wait, no, quinones are single-ringed. Actually, maybe I should just look up the structure. But since I can't search, I need to recall. Para-benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as ketones in para positions. The aromaticity is lost in the quinone structure. Quinones are known to have conjugated carbonyl groups in a cyclic dienedione. So, cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione. So this terminology.

So, cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione. So that means the six-membered ring has double bonds at positions 2-3 and 5-6 (double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6), and ketone groups at positions 1 and 4. Now, each ketone (positions 1 and 4) are in the positions adjacent to the double bonds. Wait, let's list the positions:

1: carbonyl O=.

2: double bond to 3.

3: double bond to 2.

4: carbonyl O=.

5: double bond to 6.

6: double bond to 5.

So now, the carbonyl carbons (1 and 4) are each adjacent to carbons 2 and 6 (for 1) and adjacent to carbons 3 and 5 (for 4). Now these adjacent carbons (2, 6 for 1 and 3,5 for 4):

For example, carbonyl at C1 is bonded to C2 and C6, which are part of double bonds (C2-C3 and C5-C6). So, whether does C2 or C6 have hydrogens?

In the structure cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione, the double bonds are at 2-3 and 5-6, making the ring a conjugated cyclohexadiene. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyls (C2, C6 for C1, and C3, C5 for C4) are each part of double bonds. So the carbons adjacent to carbonyls:

Carbon C2 – double bond between C2-C3, and adjacent to C1 (which is a carbonyl).

Because of the double bond, each of those carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) would only have two substituents (double bond and two single bonds). But in reality, each of them is attached to two carbons (part of the ring) and a hydrogen if possible.

Wait, let me think about the hybridization. Each of the double bond carbons (e.g., C2 and C3) are sp² hybridized, each has three bonds: the double bond, and two single bonds to adjacent carbons (C1 and C4 for C2?), then how? Wait, if the quinone structure is a six-membered ring with C1 as a carbonyl (O=C), then connected to C2 and C6; C2 is connected to C1 and C3 (double bond C2-C3); and so on.

Wait, perhaps each carbonyl group is in positions 1 and 4, and the ring has double bonds between C2-C3 and C5-C6, leaving C1 connected to C2 and C6 via single bonds. But if C1 is a carbonyl, then C1 is double bonded to O, and single bonded to C2 and C6 for a six-membered ring. Similarly, C4 is O=C, connected to C3 and C5.

In this case, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (C2 and C6 for O=C1; C3 and C5 for O=C4) are each sp² hybridized (since part of a double bond in the ring? Wait, if C2 is connected to C3 via a double bond, then C2 would have three substituents: C1, C3 (double bond), and possibly a hydrogen.

Wait, carbonyl group is O=C1-, connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected via double bond to C3, and C6 is connected via single bond to C5. No, wait, let me find the actual structure:

The correct structure of 1,4-benzoquinone is as cyclohexadienedione. Positions 1 and 4 are double bonded to oxygen. So the ring would have single bonds except for the two double bonds at positions 2-3 and 5-6, and the two carbonyl groups at 1 and 4. But in that scenario, positions 1 and 4 are connected via single bonds to adjacent carbons and double bonded to oxygen. Then, the carbons adjacent to carbonyl carbons (C1 is next to C2 and C6): is C2 part of a double bond (between C2-C3). Therefore, C2 is sp² hybridized, with bonds to C1 (single), C3 (double), and perhaps a hydrogen. Similarly, C6 is connected to C1 (single), C5 (double?), and C7? No, this seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps C6 is connected via a single bond to C5 and to C7 (but there are only six carbons in the ring. Confusion arises.

Alternatively, maybe the benzoquinone does not have any hydrogen on the carbons adjacent to carbonyl, thereby making keto-enol tautomerism impossible. Because in such a conjugated system, the carbonyl groups are locked into position, but their adjacent carbons don't have hydrogens because the quinone is fully conjugated and already stabilized. But perhaps tautomerism in such a system would disrupt aromaticity, so it won't happen. Wait, but quinones are generally not aromatic because of the conjugated carbonyls disrupting the aromatic sextet. But even so, if there are no alpha hydrogens, there can be no tautomerism.

Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can do. Let's look at the structure for that. It's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at 1, 3, and 5 positions. So, it's symmetrical. So, each ketone is separated by two carbons. Each ketone group is O=C-R. Now, the carbons adjacent to each ketone (the alpha carbons) would possess hydrogen. Since the ketones are in 1,3,5 positions, the each ketone is two carbons apart. Let's think of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That would have three keto groups in a cyclohexane ring. So, positions 1, 3, 5 each have a carbonyl group. So each of those is like, substituted on the cyclohexane, which is a six-membered ring all single bonds. So each ketal? No, each ketone. So, cyclohexane has three carbonyl groups at positions 1,3,5.

So, if cyclohexane is a chair, for instance, with ketones at 1,3,5.

Alternatively, flat structure. So ketone groups at each alternate position. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (presumably beta to the cyclohexane ring) – but in this molecule, the structure would be something like O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-CO. Not quite. Wait, but in reality, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a ring with three ketone groups.

Keerthi. If cyclohexane has ketone groups in 1,3,5 positions, each carbonyl is on a separate carbon. Then the groups would be O=C-(CH2) etc. Wait, for example, position 1 is O=C, then positions 2 and 6 are CH2, then position 3 is O=C, and so on. No, since replacing three CH2 groups with ketones.

Wait, the actual carbons in the cyclohexane ring are in a chair? Presumably in 1,3,5-tricyclohexane. If the cyclohexane is in chair conformation, but with ketone groups. But the key here is that each ketone (at position 1,3,5), has adjacent carbons (ie. positions 2 and 6 for ketone 1, positions 4 and 2 for ketone 3, etc.). Do those adjacent positions have alpha hydrogens?

If each ketone is attached to the cyclohexane carbon via a single bond (as in the cyclohexane is substituted with three CO groups), wait, but the carbonyl would be attached via a single bond. Therefore, each ketone carbonyl carbon would be O=C-R, where R is the cyclohexane carbon. So, the adjacent carbons would still have hydrogens, like R-CO, so in this case, the carbons adjacent to the ketones (which are the carbons next door in the ring) would have hydrogens.

But wait, if each ketone is on a geminal position, but in the cyclohexane, attaching to each other, how's the structure? Maybe 1,3,5-triketocyclohexane. Each ketone group has substituents adjacent, perhaps leading to enolization for tautomerism.

But think of each ketone in the cyclohexane trione. Each ketone carbon is part of the cyclohexane ring. Wait, this starts to not make sense. If the cyclohexane ring has ketones at 1,3,5 then those would be CO groups connected via single bonds to the ring carbons. Wait, in normal notation, 1,3,5-tricyclohexanone would mean three ketone groups connected to the cyclohexane ring at positions 1,3,5. Each ketone exists as a carbonyl group (C=O). So, each of those carbons (at positions 1,3,5)) are now carbonyl carbons (i.e., they can't have any hydrogens themselves), but the adjacent carbons (positions 2,6 for ketone 1; 2,4 for ketone3; 4, 6 for ketone5) would have hydrogens. Therefore, each ketone has adjacent carbons (alpha carbons) with hydrogens (H) which can potentially enolize.

Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because the ketone groups have adjacent (alpha) hydrogens. Enolization would involve the alpha hydrogen shifting to the carbonyl oxygen. However, andrea: benzoquinone does not have enolizable alpha hydrogens? Seems earlier analysis suggest in benzoquinone, the alpha carbons (adjacent to C=O) do not have hydrogens because they are part of double bonds or aromatic systems. That being the case, benzoquinone cannot tautomerize, while the cyclohexane trione can. Therefore, compound A (the one that does not show tautomerism) is benzoquinone.

Therefore, the answer for the first part (A) is benzoquinone.

Now moving to part B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs dimethyl fumarate for optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism (enantiomerism) occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (or an axis/plane of chirality) – i.e., a carbon atom with four different substituents. Alternatively, having a double bond (like allene) that allows for non-superimposable mirror images, but in general, optical isomerism most commonly arises from chiral centers.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: let's draw the structure. The parent acid would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (which is similar to lactic acid). Esterification with methyl groups. So the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure would be: O
|
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH3-C-OH
Wait, no. Wait, wait. The propanoate is propanoic acid ester. So to break it down: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CHOH-CH3 (if low numbering?), but I think the correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)-COOH. When esterified, the COOH becomes COOR. So methyl ester would be the acid's COOCH3.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, propanoate has three carbons. The functional groups are the hydroxy at C2 and the ester at C1. The formula would be: the hydroxy is on the middle carbon (C2), the ester (COOCH3) is on C1, and CH3 is on C3. Wait, alternative, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be in the middle (CH2(OH)CH2COOH), but that's 3-hydroxypropanoic acid. Wait, no. If propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH with three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3. Therefore, 2-hydroxy is on the second carbon: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3. So as an ester, the carboxylic acid part becomes an ester (COOCH3) and the rest remains. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-COO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe better to think in terms of IUPAC naming. Let me break it down: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The parent chain is propanoate (three carbons). The substituents are: a hydroxy on carbon 2 and a methyl ester. For propanoate, the ester group is on carbon 1 (that's the acid part where ester comes from). So the structure is O. Therefore, the propanoate ester would have the following structure: O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-CHOH-CH3

No, that doesn't fit. Wait, the correct structure: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. To make the methyl ester, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So methyl propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the hydroxy is on the second carbon. Which gives: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but propanoate is three-carbon: the COOCH3 is on the first carbon, then the second carbon has a hydroxy group, making the molecule HO-CH2-COOCH3 (since HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 would have four carbons). Wait, maybe not. If "propanoate" is the ester derived from propanoic acid, which is:

Propanoic acid: CH3CH2COOH

So propanoate: CH3CH2COO-R

If its methyl ester: CH3CH2COOCH3.

In "2-hydroxypropanoate," the acid would have a hydroxy group on the beta carbon (position 2 relative to the carboxylic acid), so the acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but another possibility. Maybe numbering differently. In propanoic acid, if the COOH is on carbon 1, the rest are carbons 2 and 3. So 2-hydroxy would be on carbon 2. So structure COOH-CH(OH)-CH3 for the acid. Then, methyl ester would be COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. So the ester is at the original COOH group (position 1), and hydroxy at position 2.

Now, let's see: This would give the structure CH(CH3)(OH)COOCH3.

Therefore, in this structure, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- COOCH3 (carbonyl oxygen from COOCH3? Probably not, since positionally need to check.

Wait Hmmm, forming another perspective: structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)(CH3)

Therefore, the central carbon (the one attached to COOCH3) has which substituents?

Wait, if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is HOOC-CHOH-CH3 as the acid (depending on numbering). Then the methyl ester would replace the hydrogen from the carboxylic acid. So methyl ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is O
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Or:
COOCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

So the ester (COOCH3) is on carbon 1, hydroxy (OH) on carbon 2, and methyl (CH3) on carbon 3.

So the molecule is (COOCH3)-C(OH)H-CH3. Therefore, the central carbon (carbon) or rather, the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group (carbon 2) has four substituents.

Let me visualize:

Carbon chain: COOCH3 - C(OH)(H) - CH3

So the central carbon (second carbon) has groups:

- COOCH3 (ester group, but wait, no. Wait, correction. In propanoic acid, the first carbon is the carboxylic acid, second is methylene, third is methyl. So if converting to the ester, the propanoate ester is COOCH3-O to replace the -OH of the acid. Then, the 2-hydroxy would be on the adjacent carbon (COOCH3-CHOH-CH3). Wait, no:

OH | COOCH3-CHOH-CH3. But how? Perhaps not. Where is the hydroxy group located?

Alternative approach. Let's consider IUPAC nomenclature details. The name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propionates. Propanoate is the ester of propanoic acid, so the parent is propanoic acid. In propanoate ester, the structure is CH2CH2COO-R. The ester functionality is always on the first carbon (because carboxylic acids are numbered with the COOH as carbon 1). So the carboxylic acid group is on the first carbon. So if there's a substituent (hydroxyl) on the second carbon in the propanol ester, then the structure would be:

COOCH3 (carbon 1) - CH(OH) (carbon 2) - CH3 (carbon 3)

Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

So, looking at the central carbon (carbon 2):

Attached to:

- Carbonyl oxygenated group (COOCH3 from carbon 1),
- Hydroxyl group (OH),
- Methyl group (CH3),
- And a hydrogen.

Thus, the central carbon (carbon 2) would have four different substituents:

- COOCH3 (from previous carbon, wait, wait no. Wait, carbon 2 is connected to:

Carbon 1: which is the carbonyl group (COOCH3). So, carbon 2 must be connected via a single bond to carbon 1. Wait, but carbonyl is a double bond. Wait, perhaps I need to check again.

Perhaps more correct skeletal structure:

The molecule would be:

O
||
O-C-O-CH3 (carbon 1)
|
C(OH)(CH3)-CH3

No, the entire structure must have three carbons. So carbons are as follows:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (ester group),

Carbon 2: CH(OH),

Carbon 3: CH3.

Therefore, carbon 2 is connected to:

Carbon 1 (COOCH3) via a single bond,

Hydroxy group (OH),

A hydrogen,

And a CH3 group.

Wait, but that can't be. Let me confirm once again.

Propanoic acid: CH3-CH2-COOH.

If we make methyl ester: CH3-CH2-COOCH3.

A hydroxy at position 2 would be on the CH2 group: CH2(OH)-.

So the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Ah, there we go. So that makes sense: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Therefore, carbon 2 (central carbon) would be the CH(OH) connected to the CH3 (carbon 3) and the COOCH3 (carbon 1), plus the OH and a hydrogen.

So substituents on carbon 2:

- COOCH3 group (from carbon 1),

- CH3 (carbon 3),

- OH group,

- and a hydrogen (so that's four substituents!).

So four different groups: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H (although H is a lone hydrogen). Wait, but, wait, when determining chirality, the substituents must all be different. Otherwise, not a chiral center.

So substituents on carbon 2:

Looking at the actual structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3). The central carbon (the one with OH):

1. -COOCH3 (left),

2. -CH3 (right),

3. -OH,

4. -H (the rest).

But wait, in reality, maybe carbon 2 is the middle carbon: is the substituent order such that there are two methyl groups?

No, check:

The structure's formula is:

O
||
COOCH3     OH
 |        |
CH3-C-CH3

Wait no, wait. The hydroxy is on the middle carbon. The actual structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3?

No. Wait, carbon 2 is connected to:

- one COOCH3 (from carbon 1, which is adjacent?)

Wait, key point: Propanoate is a three-carbon chain.

Carbon 1: carboxy => MeOOC-

Carbon 2: -

Carbon 3: methyl.

With 2-hydroxy. So proper structure would be: O
|
COOCH3-CHOH-CH3?

Wait, but that would put the HO-C-CH2 as:

Carbonation:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (which is OCO OCH3?), carbon 2: CH(OH), carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, getting confused again. Hold on. Consider the propenoate fragment. Propanoate has three carbons. So:

- The first carbon is the carbonyl: COOCH3 (from the original COOH esterified to methyl),

- The second carbon is the next CH2,

- The third carbon is the terminal CH3.

With a hydroxy substituent on the second carbon (in "2-hydroxypropanoate"), the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

That is, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the formula CH2(OH) connected to central CH, linked to COOCH3 and CH3.

So the carbon chain is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3    CH3
    \      /
     C-OH

Draw this. The central carbon is:

    C
   /|\
COOCH3  CH3  OH
   \
    H

Wait, but each bond here would have four bonds. Actually, the central carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3 (which is (O)CO... but the carbonyl bond is at carbon 1, so carbon 2 (the central) is a CH group.

Wait, I'm still confused. Let's establish by formula. The formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the three carbons: COOCH3-(CH(OH))-(CH3). The middle carbon, CH(OH), is attached to COOCH3, CH3, OH, and a hydrogen. OH is a substituent here, so the four substituents on the central carbon are:

1. COOCH3 (a group with structure O-CO-OCH3),

2. CH3,

3. OH,

4. H.

Well, unless structure interpretation is such that there's another substituent, but of the four, COOCH3 is a chain (O-C-O-), but in reality, the central carbon (second carbon of the ester) has:

- COOCH3 ( methyl ester carbonyl group),

- OH ( hydroxyl group),

- Two other substituents: methyl (CH3) and hydrogen.

Wait, maybe the COOCH3 is just a single group (so substituent is O-CO-OCH3), and then The central carbon is attached to OH, a methyl, and two more groups from the chain.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to draw:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 group,

Carbon 2: CH(OH) with attachments to C1 and C3,

Carbon 3: CH3.

So Carbon 2 is connected to:

From COOCH3 (C1), which replaces a hydrogen on the central carbon:

Wait, this is getting too confused. Alternatively, symbolically: the structure can be represented as O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. Thus, the middle carbon (between COOCH3 and CH3) has the substituents:

- O=C(OCH3) (from left), assuming the chain is arranged as C=O(ester), but no, maybe:

But wait, if the structure is propanoate, the chain must have three carbons. For methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:

It’s derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid), which has a hydroxyl on the second carbon (natural configuration is similar to lactic acid where we have HOOC-CHOH-CH3, but and the ester would be OCH3 instead of OH).

Wait, lactic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH (IUPAC: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid). Its methyl ester would be replacing the -COOH's OH with OCH3, giving CH3-CH-O-CO-OCH3? No: ester of propanoic acid, methyl ester would have the structure MeOOC-CHOH-CH3. Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Thus, the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3, 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? I must need to clarify.

The official IUPAC name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate implies:

The main chain has three carbons (propanoate), with the ester group on the first carbon (since propanoate comes from propanoic acid, -anoate indicating the first carbon is the carboxylate), and a hydroxy substituent on the second carbon.

Thus, the structure is....

1    2         3
COOCH3-CHOH-CH3

So first carbon is the carboxylate ester (COOCH3), second is CH with OH and CH3 adjacent (maybe). Then third is CH3.

But thus, carbon 2 is connected to COOCH3 (C1), CH3 (C3), OH, and a hydrogen (if the structure is COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. Hence, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- COOCH3 group (C1),
- CH3 (C3),
- OH,
- And a hydrogen.

These are four different substituents: a methyl ester group, a methyl group, a hydroxyl group, and a hydrogen. Therefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center. Hence, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and hence can exhibit optical isomerism (enantiomers).

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate: structure. Fumarate is the trans isomer of dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylate. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid (HOOC-CH₂-CH₂- COOH), but wait no, no. Fumaric acid is trans-1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. Wait, greater accuracy.

Fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is trans-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond in the 'trans' configuration. The esters of this would replace both carboxylic groups with ester moieties. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, with the double bond in the trans configuration. So structure: O

   ||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    / 
O-C-OCH3
   ||

(ignoring exact placement of double bonds and substituents, but in trans). However, this structure will have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond (recall fumarate is trans).

This molecule, dimethyl fumarate, doesn't have any chiral centers. Because each carbon adjacent to the double bond has two identical ester groups (on opposite sides). The carbons at the ends (each attached to COOCH3) would each be bonded to identical groups: a COOCH3 group, a CH group (the other end of the double bond), and two R groups (which would need to be same for non-chirality). Wait, actually, if it's dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, structure is (Z) or (E). Wait, fumarate is the E isomer (trans).

The structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH becomes incorrect. Wait, fumarate is butenedioate. So butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH is succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, the trans version. So, dimethyl fumarate is CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 in trans configuration.

Now, analyzing the structure:

\-OOCR1- and -OOCR1 can only be C=C. So otherwise, migrating between the carbons. Now, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups: a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. Wait, wait. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

    COOCH3
    |
CH2=C-CH2
    |
    COOCH3

No, wait no. No, actually, dimethyl fumarate is di-Ester of (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. Structure is O

The correct formula is of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl but-2-enedioate.

But-2-enedioate: the two carboxylate groups are at the two ends of the molecule on carbons 1 and 4 (if but-2-ene). So arranged as:
CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-CH2(COOCH3)?

Wait, no, but-2-enedioic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with double bond between CH₂ and CH₂? Wait, but fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So but-2-enedioic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but its double bond is at position 2. Wait, no, that's actually succinic acid. Wait, perhaps confusion arises. Let me correct. but-2-enedioic acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH ? No, adding a double bond.

No, to do but-2-enedioic acid, position 2 would be between carbons 2 and 3 (for four carbons):

But-2-enedioic acid structure: HOOC–CH2–CH₂–COOH with double bond between C2-C3? Wait, with a dioic acid groups at ends:

For but-2-enedioic acid:

Numbering the carbons:

1    2     3    4

HOOC-C= C-COOH

But it's E (trans) isomer. So the correct structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the double bond at positions 2-3 (but-2-enedioic acid), which isfumaric acid. Thus, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,4-dioxy-2-enedioic acid, dimethyl ester. I think structure is more specifically:

COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3 (trans)

In trans configuration, the two carboxy groups are on opposite sides. Hence, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-1,4-dioxy-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester. Therefore, each CH in the double bond (carbons 2 and 3) is attached to:

- a COOCH3,
- a hydrogen.

Wait, for the carbons in the double bond (each having two substituent):

In (E) configuration:
Left side: COOCH3 and H on carbon 2.
Right side: COOCH3 and H on carbon 3.)

But which one is E. Wait, with both COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. Hence, each double bond carbon has COOCH3 and H, so no chiral centers. Each double bond carbon is attached to only two different groups (since in E configuration, they are opposite). Each carbon in the trans double bond has one COOCH3 and one H, but that gives each double bond carbon:

Wait. For carbon 2:
- bonded to COOCH3,
- bonded to H,
- bonded to double bond (counts as two bonds).
Wait, wait, that can't be. If it's a double bond between C2 and C3, each has to have two substituents. Let's imagine you have carbonyls at C1 and C4:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH..

Carbon 3: CH..

Carbon 4: COOCH3

But stuck—actually, i don't think an acetate (CH2) unit satisfies. Wait, correct once and for all.

Fumarate is stabilizes trans-1,2-diolato? No. Fumaric acid simplifies:

Prop-like this: HOOC–CH=CH–COOH

Di-acid.

Bookoo experience in dertermining the structure, perhaps it’s actually the Achy the central two carbons (each double bond carbons) have each:

 one COOH (or COOCH3 for th’ester), and one CH adjacent. Apologies, that would grant the correct structure. But analyzing chirality:

For Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs dimethyl fumarate.

Now, former has a chiral center, hence could exhibit optical isomerism only up

Conclude:

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (if the central carbon is chiral) would have enantiomers, whereas dimethyl fumarate, due to its symmetry and presence of no chiral centres ( perhaps), doesn’t.

But wait, maybe double bond can introduce a different type of isomerism out, but optical isomerism relies on non-superimposable mirror images. For compuesto number B, dimethyl fumarate has a trans double bond, which gives it a plane of symmetry and thereby no chiral centers, whereas methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (carbon with four different substituents) and therefore can exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, check the possible existence of stereogenic centers in dimethyl fumarate. But given trans arrangement of the ester groups, the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate: each carbonyl group is in trans position. A molecule with a plane of symmetry cannot be chiral. Hence, it does not have optical isomerism. Whereas methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (central carbon), so it will have two enantiomers.

Hence, the answer for (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Given all this, Accretion to previous breakdown:

Answer remains as:

A: benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism),

B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism.

**Final Answer**

The compound that does not show tautomerism is \boxed{benzoquinone} (A), and the compound that shows optical isomerism is \boxed{methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate} (B).

This asymmetry allows for enantiomers. Dimethyl fumarate, however, lacks chiral centers due to its symmetrical trans-configuration and rigid planar structure, precluding optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Answers:**  \n- **(A)** Benzoquinone  \n- **(B)** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning='\n\nNow, comparing this to cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, this structure consists of a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each ketone group (carbonyl) is adjacent to two methylene groups (CH2 groups), right?\n\nIn cyclohexane-trione, each carbonyl is positioned such that the adjacent carbons each have two hydrogen atoms (as part of CH2 groups). These alpha hydrogens make keto-enol tautomerism feasible, since they can be deprotonated and the enol form can form by resonance. With three carbonyl groups in a symmetrical arrangement, each adjacent to a CH2 group, there would be multiple alpha hydrogens available for tautomeric conversions.\n\nTherefore, the key difference between the two compounds in the first pair (benzoquinone vs. cyclohexane-trione) is the presence or absence of alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone, having conjugated carbonyls with possibly no alpha hydrogens (if adjacent carbons are part of double bonds), would not undergo tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-trione, with substituents providing alpha hydrogens, would. Hence, the answer (A) should be benzoquinone not exhibiting tautomerism.\n\nNow moving to the second part: determining whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism (B). Need to analyze each structure\'s chirality.\n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid part would have a carboxylate ester group (COOCH3) and a hydroxyl (OH) group on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3). Let me draw this: carbon chain will be:\n\nCOOCH3 is attached to carbon 2, and carbon 2 also has hydroxyl (OH) and another CH3 (from propanoate, which is three carbons). Wait, clarify:\n\nPropanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The "2-hydroxypropanoic acid" would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So methyl ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The structure is: the central carbon (carbon 2) has CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another hydrogen. Wait, no. Propanoate ester with ester group on the third carbon. Wait, perhaps the numbering is different, depending on the substituent. Let me think again.\n\nPropanoate is three carbons. If it\'s 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate chain. So the carboxylic acid would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3 (but esters are from carboxylic acids). Wait, confusion arises from naming. Let\'s name properly. The parent acid is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH). If there\'s a hydroxyl group on the second carbon (the middle carbon), the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Thus, the ester methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but older nomenclature might list substituents based on another numbering. Alternatively, the structure could be OCOOCH3 connected to CH(CH3)(OH). Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let me use IUPAC nomenclature. The parent chain for propanoate is three carbons. OH substituent on the second carbon. So methyl ester would be O-methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, so structure would be: methyl ester group (OCH3) connected to the carboxylic acid part (COOCH3). The full structure would be: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH2-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the proper structure is: propanoic acid (three carbons: COOH-(CH2)2-CH3?), but with OCH3 as the ester. Wait I need to clarify.\n\nAlternative approach. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is better known as lactic acid: CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. The methyl ester of this would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Now, looking at this structure, the central carbon (the second carbon) has three substituents besides the ester group: a CH3, an OH group, and a COOCH3. Wait, hold on, let\'s confirm:\n\nWait, 2-hydroxypropanoate corresponds to:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3\n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)-\n\nCarbon 3: CH3\n\nSo the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n\nIn this case, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is the one with the hydroxyl group. The groups attached to Carbon 2 are:\n\n- CH3 (from Carbon 3),\n\n- OH,\n\n- COOCH3 (Carbon 1),\n\n- and one more hydrogen (that we can\'t see, but must be there because carbon is tetravalent).\n\nSo, the four substituents would be:\n\n1. –CH3 (methyl group from Carbon 3)\n\n2. –OH (hydroxyl)\n\n3. –COOCH3 (ester group)\n\n4. –H\n\nIf this is correct, then Carbon 2 has four different substituent groups, making it a chiral center. Because if a carbon has four distinct groups, it\'s a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nWait: Carbon 3 is CH3, right? So Carbon 2 is connected to:\n\n- On one side (left) to Carbon 1 (COOCH3),\n\n- On the other (right) to Carbon 3 (CH3),\n\n- Top and bottom would be OH and H.\n\nWait, perhaps in structure:\n\nHOOC-CH(OH)-CH3 is the acid (lactic acid), so methyl ester would be where? If it replaces the acidic proton (the -OH from COOH), so it would be HOOCC(O)OCH3- but that\'s if esterification of the carboxylic group. Wait, maybe the structure is methyl ester at COOCH3, so propanoic acid\'s COOH group being converted to COOCH3. So in that case, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. No, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. Let me correct this again. Let\'s consider propanoic acid as CH2CH2COOH. The ester, methyl propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. If the parent acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (hydroxyl on the second carbon), then the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would then be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So for this ester (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), the structure would be:\n\nCOOCH3 group, with a two-carbon chain where the second carbon (adjacent to the COOCH3) has an OH group. Wait, is there a chiral center here?\n\nThe molecule would be:\n\nCH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3\n\nAlternatively, starting from COOCH3 and counting back:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3\n\nCarbon 2: CH2\n\nCarbon 3: CH2(OH)\n\nWait, maybe, but naming might place substituents based on the chain\'s order, reversed. Hmm, perhaps this is the issue. Alternatively, NHAND draw it:  the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, that is, the propanoate is CH3COO-, but with a hydroxyl group at position 2. Wait, this is unclear. Let me ensure correct IUPAC structure.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name would be based on the longest chain. If the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the formula would be:\n\nPropanoate means three-carbon chain, so numbering from COOCH3 group as carbon 1.\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3 (ester)\nCarbon 2: CH(OH)\nCarbon 3: CH3\n\nSo structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3\n\nIn this case, is Carbon 2 (CH(OH)) attached to:\n\n- COOCH3 (carbon 1),\n- CH3 (carbon 3),\n- OH (hydroxyl),\n- and a hydrogen?\n\nSo that\'s four different groups attached to Carbon 2: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H? If that\'s the case, then Carbon 2 would be a chiral center with four distinct substituents, meaning the compound would have optical isomerism (enantiomers). Hence, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would show optical isomerism. So (B) would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nBut then the question is between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Let me check dimethyl fumarate for optical isomerism.\n\nDimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid) with methanol. Fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, trans configuration, actually. Wait, correction: Fumaric acid is trans-1,2-dihydroxyethylene-dicarboxylic acid? Wait no. Actually, fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid, specifically (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The molecule has a double bond between C2 and C3 (if numbering starts from the COOH ends). The trans configuration across the double bond.\n\nWhen esterified with methanol (dimethyl fumarate would be both carboxy groups esterified with methyl groups: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.\n\nIn this structure, each of the two carboxy groups is an ester (OCH3). The molecule is symmetrical in that the two ester groups are on either end of the trans double bond. Thus, the molecule has a center of symmetry. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center because any carbon within the chain connected to the ester groups isn\'t a chiral center. Let me make sure.\n\nThe two ester groups (COOCH3) are on either end of the trans double bond. Looking at the structure:\n\nCH2=CH becomes, with fumerate, it\'s HOOC-CH=CH-COOH trans. As dimethyl ester: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is between the two inner carbons (CH groups). Each of these inner carbons is connected to one COOCH3 group and to the other CH across the double bond. However, the question is whether this compound has any stereocenters (chirality) or any possibility for optical isomerism.\n\nSince the molecule is symmetric (due to ester groups on both ends and trans configuration), in fumarate, the dimethyl ester version will have symmetry such that no individual carbon in this structure has four distinct groups. Both double-bonded carbons have two identical substituents (e.g., each is connected to a COOCH3 group, a H, and a double bond), making them not chiral. The double bond has E geometry, but this is a type of stereoisomerism (geometric), but not optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate exists as a single geometric isomer (trans), but does not have any chiral centers. As it has a plane of symmetry (the molecule is symmetrical along the center), so even if there\'s an asymmetric center, the symmetry could negate chirality[ (meso compound), but dimethyl fumarate doesn’t have tetrahedral stereocenters].\n\nAlternatively, we can check if each of the double bond carbons is attached to two identical groups.\n\nEach carbon in the double bond in fumarate: groups are (for each CH):\n\n- one COOCH3,\n\n- one H,\n\n- and two times the other CH (the double bonded partner).\n\nWait I need to visualize:\n\nStructure:\n\n    COOCH3\n    |\nCH2=CH\n    |\n    COOCH3\n\nWait, but corrected with trans. If the double bond is trans, the arrangement would be:\n\n       COOCH3\n            \\\n             C=C\n            /\n       COOCH3\n\nBut in actual fumarate (trans), the groups on either side of the double bond should be opposite. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,2-dicarboxyethylene: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH—with trans double bond—but realization hits that both carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\nWait, now confused again. Let\'s correct. Fumarate (but-2-enedioic acid) structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No. (wait no, but-2-enedioic acid would be HOOC-CH=C(H)-COOH). Wait, but for trans configuration, the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides.\n\nBut for butenedioic acid, the structure would be:\n\nHOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH for a single bond. With a double bond at position 2, it would be HOOC-CH₂-CH-COOH, but in trans configuration (fumaric acid) the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So, fumarate is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid, which would have COOH groups on C1 and C4, and the double bond between C2 and C3. Each of these would have the configuration: substituents on either end.\n\nWait, but-2-enedioic acid:\n\nPosition 1: COOH\n\nPosition 2: CH\n\nPosition 3: CH\n\nPosition 4: COOH\n\nWith double bond between positions 2 and 3. Then, when it\'s trans (fumaric acid), the COOH groups are on opposite sides. For dimethyl fumarate, those COOH groups become COOCH3. Hence, it\'s (E)-1,4-dicarbomethoxy-but-2-ene. The structure would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\nNow, does this molecule have any chiral centers?\n\nLooking at C-2 and C-3 (the atoms involved in the double bond):\n\nEach is connected via the double bond. The substituents on each are COOCH3, H, and the other CH (from the double bond. Since each carbon (C2 and C3) has two identical substituents (each connected to another CH), in fact, let\'s check:\n\nFor C2: The substituents are:\n\n- COOCH3 (left)\n\n- CH (from double bond to C3)\n\n- Two H atoms (since in double bond we have two substituents). Wait, carbons in a double bond (like in ethene) are sp² hybridized and each have three substituents. So for C2 in dimethyl fumarate:\n\nThe three substituents are:\n\n1. COOCH3 group\n\n2. The double bond to C3\n\n3. A hydrogen atom\n\nSimilarly, for C3:\n\nSubstituents are:\n\n1. COOCH3 group\n\n2. The double bond to C2\n\n3. A hydrogen atom\n\nHence, both C2 and C3 have three substituents (COOCH3, H, and a double bond) but each has three substituents (one of them being a double bond). However, chiral centers in organic chemistry require a carbon with four different substituents. Since the double bond constrains the carbons to three groupings (since double bonds don\'t count), but in this case, C2 and C3 would have:\n\nGrouped as:\n\nAt C2:\n\n- COOCH3,\n\n- H,\n\n- and C3.\n\nBut since the C2 is still part of the double bond (with two substituents), there is no possibility here for chiral centers here. Also, both C2 and C3 can\'t have four substituents, hence no chiral centers exist in dimethyl fumarate.\n\nThus, the molecule does not exhibit optical isomerism because there are no chiral centers.\n\nAlternatively, looking at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if it has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers. Therefore, (B) would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nWait, but initially, I thought - if structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (second carbon, adjacent to COOCH3):\n\nAdjacent groups:\n\n- CH3 (from the first carbon, which may actually be connected as... Let me redraw this again correctly. Maybe prior analysis was incorrect.\n\nIf the structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:\n\nThe formula would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.\n\nThe parent chain would be three carbons:\n\n1. COOCH3 (ester group)\n\n2. CH(OH) (second carbon)\n\n3. CH3 (third carbon)\n\nSo Carbon 2 (middle carbon) would be connected to:\n\n- COOCH3 (Carbon 1)\n\n- OH group\n\n- CH3 (Carbon 3)\n\n- And one hydrogen.\n\nBecause in such an arrangement, a propanoate would have three carbons. Methyl ester is on the first carbon (COOCH3), then carbon 2 has an OH, then carbon 3 is a methyl group.\n\nHence, the substituents for carbon 2 are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. All four are different. Therefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center with four different substituents. Thus, this molecule can exist as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).\n\nHence, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which has a chiral center) and dimethyl fumarate (which has a planar, symmetrical structure and no chiral centers), the former would exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nConfirming, then, the answers should be:\n\nA: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (vs. cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione which can).\n\nB: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism (vs. dimethyl fumarate which does not).\n\nSo, final answers: (A) benzoquinone; (B) methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743809738, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4135, prompt_tokens=589, total_tokens=4724, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

**Answer:**

1. **Compound (A) that does not show tautomerism:**  
   **Benzoquinone**  
   - **Reasoning:** Benzoquinone (specifically para-benzoquinone) lacks alpha hydrogens adjacent to its carbonyl groups, which are necessary for keto-enol tautomerism. The conjugated system in benzoquinone positions the carbonyls such that adjacent carbons are part of double bonds and lack hydrogens, preventing proton transfer. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has carbonyl groups flanked by CH₂ groups with alpha hydrogens, enabling tautomerism.

2. **Compound (B) that shows optical isomerism:**  
   **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   - **Reasoning:** Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (the methyl ester of lactic acid) has a chiral center at the second carbon (C2), which is bonded to four distinct groups (–CH₃, –OH, –COOCH₃, and –H). This asymmetry allows for enantiomers. Dimethyl fumarate, however, lacks chiral centers due to its symmetrical trans-configuration and rigid planar structure, precluding optical isomerism.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning



Now, comparing this to cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, this structure consists of a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each ketone group (carbonyl) is adjacent to two methylene groups (CH2 groups), right?

In cyclohexane-trione, each carbonyl is positioned such that the adjacent carbons each have two hydrogen atoms (as part of CH2 groups). These alpha hydrogens make keto-enol tautomerism feasible, since they can be deprotonated and the enol form can form by resonance. With three carbonyl groups in a symmetrical arrangement, each adjacent to a CH2 group, there would be multiple alpha hydrogens available for tautomeric conversions.

Therefore, the key difference between the two compounds in the first pair (benzoquinone vs. cyclohexane-trione) is the presence or absence of alpha hydrogens. Benzoquinone, having conjugated carbonyls with possibly no alpha hydrogens (if adjacent carbons are part of double bonds), would not undergo tautomerism, whereas cyclohexane-trione, with substituents providing alpha hydrogens, would. Hence, the answer (A) should be benzoquinone not exhibiting tautomerism.

Now moving to the second part: determining whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism (B). Need to analyze each structure's chirality.

First, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid part would have a carboxylate ester group (COOCH3) and a hydroxyl (OH) group on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3). Let me draw this: carbon chain will be:

COOCH3 is attached to carbon 2, and carbon 2 also has hydroxyl (OH) and another CH3 (from propanoate, which is three carbons). Wait, clarify:

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The "2-hydroxypropanoic acid" would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So methyl ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The structure is: the central carbon (carbon 2) has CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another hydrogen. Wait, no. Propanoate ester with ester group on the third carbon. Wait, perhaps the numbering is different, depending on the substituent. Let me think again.

Propanoate is three carbons. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate chain. So the carboxylic acid would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3 (but esters are from carboxylic acids). Wait, confusion arises from naming. Let's name properly. The parent acid is propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH). If there's a hydroxyl group on the second carbon (the middle carbon), the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Thus, the ester methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but older nomenclature might list substituents based on another numbering. Alternatively, the structure could be OCOOCH3 connected to CH(CH3)(OH). Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let me use IUPAC nomenclature. The parent chain for propanoate is three carbons. OH substituent on the second carbon. So methyl ester would be O-methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, so structure would be: methyl ester group (OCH3) connected to the carboxylic acid part (COOCH3). The full structure would be: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH2-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the proper structure is: propanoic acid (three carbons: COOH-(CH2)2-CH3?), but with OCH3 as the ester. Wait I need to clarify.

Alternative approach. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is better known as lactic acid: CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. The methyl ester of this would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Now, looking at this structure, the central carbon (the second carbon) has three substituents besides the ester group: a CH3, an OH group, and a COOCH3. Wait, hold on, let's confirm:

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate corresponds to:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)-

Carbon 3: CH3

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is the one with the hydroxyl group. The groups attached to Carbon 2 are:

- CH3 (from Carbon 3),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (Carbon 1),

- and one more hydrogen (that we can't see, but must be there because carbon is tetravalent).

So, the four substituents would be:

1. –CH3 (methyl group from Carbon 3)

2. –OH (hydroxyl)

3. –COOCH3 (ester group)

4. –H

If this is correct, then Carbon 2 has four different substituent groups, making it a chiral center. Because if a carbon has four distinct groups, it's a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait: Carbon 3 is CH3, right? So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- On one side (left) to Carbon 1 (COOCH3),

- On the other (right) to Carbon 3 (CH3),

- Top and bottom would be OH and H.

Wait, perhaps in structure:

HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3 is the acid (lactic acid), so methyl ester would be where? If it replaces the acidic proton (the -OH from COOH), so it would be HOOCC(O)OCH3- but that's if esterification of the carboxylic group. Wait, maybe the structure is methyl ester at COOCH3, so propanoic acid's COOH group being converted to COOCH3. So in that case, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. No, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. Let me correct this again. Let's consider propanoic acid as CH2CH2COOH. The ester, methyl propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. If the parent acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (hydroxyl on the second carbon), then the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would then be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So for this ester (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate), the structure would be:

COOCH3 group, with a two-carbon chain where the second carbon (adjacent to the COOCH3) has an OH group. Wait, is there a chiral center here?

The molecule would be:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3

Alternatively, starting from COOCH3 and counting back:

Carbon 1: COOCH3

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: CH2(OH)

Wait, maybe, but naming might place substituents based on the chain's order, reversed. Hmm, perhaps this is the issue. Alternatively, NHAND draw it:  the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, that is, the propanoate is CH3COO-, but with a hydroxyl group at position 2. Wait, this is unclear. Let me ensure correct IUPAC structure.

The correct IUPAC name would be based on the longest chain. If the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the formula would be:

Propanoate means three-carbon chain, so numbering from COOCH3 group as carbon 1.

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (ester)
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: CH3

So structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3

In this case, is Carbon 2 (CH(OH)) attached to:

- COOCH3 (carbon 1),
- CH3 (carbon 3),
- OH (hydroxyl),
- and a hydrogen?

So that's four different groups attached to Carbon 2: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H? If that's the case, then Carbon 2 would be a chiral center with four distinct substituents, meaning the compound would have optical isomerism (enantiomers). Hence, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would show optical isomerism. So (B) would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

But then the question is between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. Let me check dimethyl fumarate for optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid) with methanol. Fumaric acid is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, trans configuration, actually. Wait, correction: Fumaric acid is trans-1,2-dihydroxyethylene-dicarboxylic acid? Wait no. Actually, fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid, specifically (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The molecule has a double bond between C2 and C3 (if numbering starts from the COOH ends). The trans configuration across the double bond.

When esterified with methanol (dimethyl fumarate would be both carboxy groups esterified with methyl groups: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

In this structure, each of the two carboxy groups is an ester (OCH3). The molecule is symmetrical in that the two ester groups are on either end of the trans double bond. Thus, the molecule has a center of symmetry. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center because any carbon within the chain connected to the ester groups isn't a chiral center. Let me make sure.

The two ester groups (COOCH3) are on either end of the trans double bond. Looking at the structure:

CH2=CH becomes, with fumerate, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH trans. As dimethyl ester: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is between the two inner carbons (CH groups). Each of these inner carbons is connected to one COOCH3 group and to the other CH across the double bond. However, the question is whether this compound has any stereocenters (chirality) or any possibility for optical isomerism.

Since the molecule is symmetric (due to ester groups on both ends and trans configuration), in fumarate, the dimethyl ester version will have symmetry such that no individual carbon in this structure has four distinct groups. Both double-bonded carbons have two identical substituents (e.g., each is connected to a COOCH3 group, a H, and a double bond), making them not chiral. The double bond has E geometry, but this is a type of stereoisomerism (geometric), but not optical isomerism.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate exists as a single geometric isomer (trans), but does not have any chiral centers. As it has a plane of symmetry (the molecule is symmetrical along the center), so even if there's an asymmetric center, the symmetry could negate chirality[ (meso compound), but dimethyl fumarate doesn’t have tetrahedral stereocenters].

Alternatively, we can check if each of the double bond carbons is attached to two identical groups.

Each carbon in the double bond in fumarate: groups are (for each CH):

- one COOCH3,

- one H,

- and two times the other CH (the double bonded partner).

Wait I need to visualize:

Structure:

    COOCH3
    |
CH2=CH
    |
    COOCH3

Wait, but corrected with trans. If the double bond is trans, the arrangement would be:

       COOCH3
            \
             C=C
            /
       COOCH3

But in actual fumarate (trans), the groups on either side of the double bond should be opposite. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,2-dicarboxyethylene: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH—with trans double bond—but realization hits that both carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, now confused again. Let's correct. Fumarate (but-2-enedioic acid) structure: HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No. (wait no, but-2-enedioic acid would be HOOC-CH=C(H)-COOH). Wait, but for trans configuration, the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides.

But for butenedioic acid, the structure would be:

HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH for a single bond. With a double bond at position 2, it would be HOOC-CH₂-CH-COOH, but in trans configuration (fumaric acid) the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So, fumarate is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid, which would have COOH groups on C1 and C4, and the double bond between C2 and C3. Each of these would have the configuration: substituents on either end.

Wait, but-2-enedioic acid:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH

Position 3: CH

Position 4: COOH

With double bond between positions 2 and 3. Then, when it's trans (fumaric acid), the COOH groups are on opposite sides. For dimethyl fumarate, those COOH groups become COOCH3. Hence, it's (E)-1,4-dicarbomethoxy-but-2-ene. The structure would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers?

Looking at C-2 and C-3 (the atoms involved in the double bond):

Each is connected via the double bond. The substituents on each are COOCH3, H, and the other CH (from the double bond. Since each carbon (C2 and C3) has two identical substituents (each connected to another CH), in fact, let's check:

For C2: The substituents are:

- COOCH3 (left)

- CH (from double bond to C3)

- Two H atoms (since in double bond we have two substituents). Wait, carbons in a double bond (like in ethene) are sp² hybridized and each have three substituents. So for C2 in dimethyl fumarate:

The three substituents are:

1. COOCH3 group

2. The double bond to C3

3. A hydrogen atom

Similarly, for C3:

Substituents are:

1. COOCH3 group

2. The double bond to C2

3. A hydrogen atom

Hence, both C2 and C3 have three substituents (COOCH3, H, and a double bond) but each has three substituents (one of them being a double bond). However, chiral centers in organic chemistry require a carbon with four different substituents. Since the double bond constrains the carbons to three groupings (since double bonds don't count), but in this case, C2 and C3 would have:

Grouped as:

At C2:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and C3.

But since the C2 is still part of the double bond (with two substituents), there is no possibility here for chiral centers here. Also, both C2 and C3 can't have four substituents, hence no chiral centers exist in dimethyl fumarate.

Thus, the molecule does not exhibit optical isomerism because there are no chiral centers.

Alternatively, looking at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if it has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers. Therefore, (B) would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, but initially, I thought - if structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (second carbon, adjacent to COOCH3):

Adjacent groups:

- CH3 (from the first carbon, which may actually be connected as... Let me redraw this again correctly. Maybe prior analysis was incorrect.

If the structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate:

The formula would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The parent chain would be three carbons:

1. COOCH3 (ester group)

2. CH(OH) (second carbon)

3. CH3 (third carbon)

So Carbon 2 (middle carbon) would be connected to:

- COOCH3 (Carbon 1)

- OH group

- CH3 (Carbon 3)

- And one hydrogen.

Because in such an arrangement, a propanoate would have three carbons. Methyl ester is on the first carbon (COOCH3), then carbon 2 has an OH, then carbon 3 is a methyl group.

Hence, the substituents for carbon 2 are: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. All four are different. Therefore, carbon 2 is a chiral center with four different substituents. Thus, this molecule can exist as a pair of enantiomers (optical isomers).

Hence, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (which has a chiral center) and dimethyl fumarate (which has a planar, symmetrical structure and no chiral centers), the former would exhibit optical isomerism.

Confirming, then, the answers should be:

A: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism (vs. cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione which can).

B: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism (vs. dimethyl fumarate which does not).

So, final answers: (A) benzoquinone; (B) methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
