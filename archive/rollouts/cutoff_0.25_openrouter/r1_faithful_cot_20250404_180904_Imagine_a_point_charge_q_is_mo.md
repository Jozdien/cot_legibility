# Original Question

Imagine a point charge q is moving with a trajectory $\vec{s}(t)$, where t is time, with respect to the origin. Let $\vec{r}$ be the field point, where the field is observed, with respect to the origin of the same reference frame, and  $\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\vec{r}$. The velocity of the moving charge q at the field generating instant $tr$ is $\vec{v}$. What are the scalar potential (V) and vector potential (\vec{A}) at time t, satisfying $t > tr$, and position $\vec{r}$?

To determine the scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \) due to a moving point charge \( q \), we use the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the retarded time \( tr \), which is the time when the electromagnetic field was emitted, considering the finite speed of light \( c \).

The key quantities involved are:
- \( \vec{d} \): The vector from the charge's position at the retarded time \( tr \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), with magnitude \( |\vec{d}| \).
- \( \vec{v} \): The velocity of the charge at the retarded time \( tr \).

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) are given by:

\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{|\vec{d}| \left( 1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c |\vec{d}|} \right)}
\]

\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \cdot \frac{q \vec{v}}{|\vec{d}| \left( 1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c |\vec{d}|} \right)}
\]

In these expressions, the denominator term \( 1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c |\vec{d}|} \) accounts for the Doppler effect due to the charge's velocity relative to the observation point. The potentials are evaluated at the retarded time \( tr \), ensuring causality by considering the propagation delay of the electromagnetic field.

### Final Answer
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \) are given by:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \dfrac{q}{\left| \vec{d} \right| \left( 1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }{ c \left| \vec{d} \right| } \right) } }
\]
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{ \mu_0 }{4 \pi } \cdot \dfrac{ q \vec{v} }{ \left| \vec{d} \right| \left( 1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }{ c \left| \vec{d} \right| } \right) } }
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a position r and time t, created by a moving point charge q. The charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're using the origin as the reference frame. The key thing here is that the potentials at time t depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time tr, the retarded time, right? Because the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, so we have to account for that delay.

First, remember that in electrodynamics, the potentials are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Those are the ones that take into account the retardation effect. Let me recall their form. The scalar potential V is usually something like [1/(4πε₀)] multiplied by the charge divided by the retarded distance minus the projection of the velocity (at the retarded time) onto the direction of the retarded position. But maybe it's better to write down the exact expressions.

Wait, so the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / (d * (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c)) ] evaluated at the retarded time tr.

Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / (d * (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c)) ] evaluated at tr.

But what are each of the variables here? Let me verify. In the problem statement, they defined d as the vector from the position of the charge at the retarded time tr to the observation point r. So, d is the vector pointing from s(tr) to r. So d = r - s(tr). The velocity v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, tr. So v = ds/dt evaluated at tr.

Then, d is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. So |d| is |r - s(tr)|, right? Then d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. The term in the denominator, (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c), is the Doppler factor or the retardation factor. So it accounts for the fact that if the charge is moving towards the observation point, the potentials are enhanced, and if it's moving away, they're reduced.

Wait, but the denominator would be d - (v ⋅ d)/c, but since d is a vector, when taking the dot product with v, which is a vector, then (v ⋅ d) would be the scalar product. So actually, the retarded-time denominator has the term 1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c. So writing it as d * [1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c] makes sense. Therefore, the scalar potential is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q / [d (1 - v⋅d̂/c) ]) evaluated at tr.

Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v / [d (1 - v⋅d̂/c) ]) evaluated at tr.

But I also want to confirm notations and any possible alternative expressions. Another way to write this is using the retarded position, but since here they've defined d as the vector from s(tr) to r, perhaps this is consistent.

Wait, but sometimes the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are expressed in terms of the retarded position and velocity. Let me check units as well. Scalar potential has units of volts, which is N·m/C, and 1/(4πε₀) has units of N·m²/C². So q over (something with units of meters) would need the denominator to have units of meters. So (d (1 - v·d̂/c)) - since (v·d̂)/c is dimensionless, the denominator is in meters, which matches. Similarly for the vector potential, μ₀ has units of H/m, which is T·m/A, and the term (qv) would have units C·(m/s). So (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v / [d (1 - ...) ]) - with μ₀ in T·m/A, and (q v) in C·m/s, divide by meters, so (T·m/A) * (C·m/s) / m = T·m/A * C/s. Since 1 T = 1 N/(A·m), so substituting in, T·m/A = (N/(A·m)) * m/A = N/A². Then (N/A²) * (C/s). Since 1 C/s is Ampere, so A. Then (N/A²)*A = N/A. But the vector potential A is supposed to have units of T·m or Wb/m, but let me check:

The vector potential A is such that B = ∇×A, so B must have units of Tesla, and ∇ has units 1/m, so A must be Tesla·meter. Alternatively, in SI units, H (henry) is Wb/A, so 1 H = 1 Wb/A. The units of A are Wb/m. Let me compute the units for the expression (μ₀/(4π)) * ( q v / (distance * dimensionless )).

μ₀ has units H/m. q is in C. v is in m/s. Distance is in m. Then H/m * (C * m/s) / m = (H/m) * (C/(s)) because m/s divided by m is 1/(s). Since C/s is Ampere, A. Then H/m * A = (H·A)/m. But H is Wb/A, so H·A/m = Wb/(m) , since (Wb/A)*A = Wb, then divided by m. So Wb/m is indeed the unit of the vector potential. Check. That's correct.

Similarly, scalar potential V has units of volts. Checking the expression [1/(4πε₀)] * [q/(something)]. 1/(4πε₀) is in N·m²/C², times q (C) divided by something in meters. So (N·m²/C²) * C / m = N·m/C, which is J/C, and since V is J/C, that's correct. So the units check out.

Alternatively, another way to write these potentials is with the denominator term as d - (v ⋅ d)/c, but let's see. If we factor out d, then it's d(1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c), where d̂ = d / |d|, which is the unit vector in the direction of d. Therefore, the denominator is d times (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c). But in some references, the Doppler factor is written as (1 - β ⋅ r̂), where β = v/c and r̂ is the direction from the charge to the observation point. That's basically the same as here.

But in the problem statement, it defined d as the vector from the charge's earlier position (at tr) to the field point r, so that's the same as r - s(tr). So that makes sense, and d is the separation vector at the retarded time. The velocity v is at tr.

Therefore, summarizing, the potentials are:

Scalar potential V(r, t) = [1/(4πε₀)] * [ q / (d (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c) ) ]

Vector potential A(r, t) = [μ₀/(4π)] * [ q v / (d (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c) ) ]

But since the fields are to be evaluated at time t, but the potentials depend on the retarded time tr when the fields were emitted. So tr is the solution to the equation t = tr + d(tr)/c, where d(tr) = |r - s(tr)| / c. But perhaps specifying that tr is the retarded time such that the condition t = tr + d/c holds.

But in the problem statement they just give that the potentials are to be written at time t, given that t > tr, so tr is the retarded time. The expression probably does not need to solve for tr, but just specify that the quantities (d, v, etc.) are evaluated at tr.

Therefore, writing the potentials as:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / ( |d| (1 - \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ /c ) ) ] evaluated at tr,

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q \vec{v} / ( |d| (1 - \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ /c ) ) ] evaluated at tr.

But we need to use the problem's notation. The problem defines \vec{d} as the vector from the charge's position at tr to observation point \vec{r}, so |d| is the distance, which we can write as d.

Therefore, substituting:

Scalar potential V( \vec{r}, t ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q ) / ( d * (1 - \vec{v} ⋅ ( \vec{d}/d ) /c ) )

Which simplifies to: (1/(4πε₀)) * q / ( d - ( \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) / c )

But perhaps leaving it as d(1 - (\vec{v} ⋅ d̂)/c ) is compatible with the problem notation. The problem mentions using ε₀, μ₀, c. It says "in obtaining the expressions", can we just write the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials?

Yes, so the answer is indeed the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / (d (1 - \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ /c )) ] ret,

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q \vec{v} / (d (1 - \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ /c )) ] ret,

where "ret" indicates evaluation at the retarded time tr. Since the problem does not require deriving them, just to state the expressions, using the given notation.

Checking again that each symbol is as per problem definition:

- q is the charge.

- \vec{d} is the vector from the charge's retarded position s(tr) to the field point \vec{r}; so magnitude d = | \vec{r} - s(tr) |.

- \vec{v} is the velocity of the charge at tr.

- All constants: ε₀ for permittivity, μ₀ for permeability, c for speed of light.

So both potentials have the denominator of d times (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c ). Hmmm, some textbooks present Liénard-Wiechert with denominator ( c d - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ). Let's verify dimensions. d is in meters. \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} is in (m/s)(m) = m²/s. Multiply that by 1/c (s/m), would get (m²/s)(s/m) = m. So c d is m/s * m = m²/s. \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} is velocity times position. So (c d - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d}) would need to have units m²/s - m²/s, but wait, that's consistent, so ( c d - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) is a term measured in m²/s, but then to use it in the denominator for potentials which supposed to have [V] ~ C/(F*m) check better.

Wait, perhaps there's a confusion in the different formulations. Perhaps the problem prefers the denominator written as d - (\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}) / c ?

Wait, let's check.

If the denominator is d ( 1 - ( \vec{v } \cdot d̂ ) / c ) = d - ( \vec{v} \cdot ( d * d̂ ) ) / c = d - ( \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} ) / c. So yes, because d = |\vec{d}|, d̂ = \vec{d}/d. Therefore, (1 - ( \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ )/c ) is the same as ( c - \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ ) / c. Therefore, multiplying by d: ( c d - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) / c. Hmm. So the denominator can also be written as ( c d - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) / c. Therefore, inverting:

1 / [ d (1 - v⋅d̂ /c ) ] = c / ( c d - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) .

Thus, V is (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q c ) / ( c d - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) .

Similarly for A: (μ₀/(4π)) * ( q \vec{v} c ) / ( c d - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) .

But maybe in some references, Liénard-Wiechert potentials are presented in that form, especially if using Gaussian units or other unit systems, but in SI units, the usual presentation is as per scattering the 1/c factors. Wait, but in the expression here,

Wait in SI units, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are often written as:

V( r, t ) = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q / (κ d ) )

A( r, t ) = ( μ₀/(4π) ) * ( q \vec{v} / ( κ d ) )

where κ = 1 - \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ / c.

But which brings that denominator.

Alternatively, some textbook (Griffiths for example?) uses κ = (1 - \vec{β} ⋅ \vec{ṙ}), where β = v/c and ṙ is the unit vector from the retarded position.

Perhaps I should refer to the standard form. Griffiths, Introduction to Electrodynamics, 4th edition, formulas 10.39 and 10.40: The potentials are

V( r, t ) = \frac{1}{4πε₀} \frac{q c}{ ( r c - \vec{r} ⋅ \vec{v} )

but let me check.

Wait, no. In Griffiths, L-W potentials are written as:

V( r, t ) = \frac{1}{4πε₀} \frac{ q }{ ( \scrpt{r} - \vec{\scrpt{r}} ⋅ \vec{v}/c ) }

Wait, sorry, I may be mixing things up. Griffiths defines radiated and non-radiated fields but initially states.

Upon a quick check, in Griffiths (4th Ed.), equations 10.41 and 10.42, I think he denotes:

For a moving charge, φ(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q / (κ \scrpt{r} ) )

And similarly for A.

Where κ = 1 - \vec{ \scrpt{r} } ⋅ \vec{v}/c. Here, \scrpt{r} is the vector from the retarded position to the field point. So scrpt{r} would be our \vec{d}, and κ is the same as our 1 - ( \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ ) / c. So the denominator is \scrpt{r} ( 1 - ( \vec{v} ⋅ \scrpt{r} \huge{ˆ} ) /c ). So same as we have.

Therefore, my initial expressions are correct. The denominators are indeed given by d (1 - ( \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ ) / c ).

But to reconcile the units, you can see that:

If you have 1/[d (1 - v⋅d̂/c ) ] . Since (1 - v⋅d̂/c ) is dimensionless, it's like dividing by d. So scalar potential would have units  [charge] / [length], multiplied by 1/(4πε₀), which is correct as already checked.

However, in some literature, the vector potential is written as A = [ μ₀ c ]/[4 π ] * ( q \vec{v } ) / ( c d - \vec{v } ⋅ \vec{d } ), because of pulling out a factor of c.

Which would result from reorganizing the denominator:

d (1 - \vec{v } ⋅ d̂ /c ) = d - ( \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d } ) /c. So,

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / ( d (1 - \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ /c ) )

is the same as:

(1/(4πε₀)) * q c / ( c d - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} )

Similarly.

But since the problem does not specify which form to present them, so which is better?

Possibly, either form is acceptable. But given that the problem defines \vec{d} as the vector from the charge at tr to r, so they call \vec{d} as that vector, which is consistent with the standard retarded position.

Alternatively, some use R for the retarded distance, but here they use \vec{d}.

Given that, and considering that when writing, perhaps leaving in the 1 - v⋅d̂ /c format is more straightforward. Also, sometimes this denominator is interpreted as the "retarded denominator" factor arising from the Doppler effect.

Therefore, original answer.

One more thing: the problem says "what are the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, satisfying t > tr, and position r?" So the potentials have to be expressed in terms of the retarded quantities, meaning that tr is the solution where tr = t - | \vec{r} - \vec{s}(tr) | /c. Even though in practical calculation, the retarded time is an implicit function here, but for defining the potentials, you don’t need to solve for tr, but rather use the quantities at tr. Hence, the final answer would be as written above.

Double-check whether we have to include μ₀ and ε₀ in the expressions. Yes, the problem's notation states: use ε₀ (permittivity), μ₀ (permeability), and c (light speed). Therefore, their correct usage is essential.

Alternatively, in Gauss units, the potentials can be written with different constants. But since the problem says ε₀, μ₀, and c, it must be SI.

Therefore, confirming:

Scalar potential: [1/(4πε₀)] * q / [ denominator ]

Vector potential: [μ₀/(4π)] * q v / [ denominator ]

Denominator: d(1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c )

Therefore, in boxed form:

V( \vec{r}, t ) = \boxed{ \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{ \left( d \left( 1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }{ c d } \right) \right) } }

But (v ⋅ d ) is (v_x d_x + v_y d_y + v_z d_z ), so (v ⋅ d ) / d is v ⋅ d̂, since d̂ = \vec{d} / d. Therefore, simplifying:

1 - [ (vec{v} · vec{d} ) / (c d ) ] = 1 - ( vec{v} · d̂ ) / c.

Therefore, another way is to define scalar and vector potentials as:

V = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{ d (1 - \vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}/c ) }

where \hat{d} is the unit vector in the direction of \vec{d}.

Since in the problem statement, \vec{d} is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point, which is our previous \vec{d}, then the unit vector d̂ is vector d divided by its magnitude d. Thus, in LaTeX, it can be written as \vec{d}/d.

But the question is whether to leave it in terms of the vector quantities or split into components. Since velocity v and vector d are provided as vectors, using the notation in the problem.

Thus, the answer would be presented as:

Scalar potential:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c d}\right)} 

But we can simplify the term in the denominator:

\vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d}/ ( c d ) = ( \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) / ( c d ) = ( \vec{v} ⋅ \hat{d} ) / c.

So alternatively:

V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} 

To make it more explicit, \hat{d} is \vec{d}/d.

But the problem didn't use hat notation for the unit vector; they just said that \vec{d} is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point. Thus, in the denominator, perhaps using d = | \vec{d} |, so write the denominator as | \vec{d} | (1 - ( \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) / (c | \vec{d} | )), which combines both possibilities.

Therefore, boxed answer:

For the scalar potential:
$
V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{ |\vec{d}| \left( 1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }{ c | \vec{d} | } \right) } } 
$

Similarly, for the vector potential:

$
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \dfrac{q \vec{v}}{ |\vec{d}| \left( 1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }{ c | \vec{d} | } \right) } } 
$

Alternatively, expressing the denominator as 1 - (\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d})/c since:

(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})/(c |\vec{d}|) = \vec{v} \cdot ( \vec{d}/|\vec{d}| ) / c = (\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}) / c. That could be notation, but since \hat{d} was not defined in the problem statement, perhaps stick to using \vec{d}/|\vec{d}|.

But the problem might accept either form. However, since \vec{d} is the vector from the charge's past position to the field point, then d in denominator is just the magnitude. So the more explicit answer would be:

In scalar potential, denominator: |\vec{d}| (1 - ( \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} )/( c |\vec{d}| ))

Simplifying:

Cancel one |\vec{d}| in the numerator and denominator of the second term:

|\vec{d}| * [1 - ( \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} )/(c |\vec{d}| ) ] = |\vec{d}| - ( \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ) / c = [ c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} ] / c

Therefore, an alternative way to write the scalar potential could be:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q c / ( c |\vec{d}| - \vec{v} ⋅ \vec{d} )

But this might not be necessary as per problem requirements. Depending on the problem's intention. However, if they want it in terms of \vec{d}, as per their definitions, then the original expression with splitting into magnitude and direction is better.

But checking consistency with standard terminology:

Yes, I think the key point is that the potentials are proportional to q divided by d times (1 - v⋅d̂ /c ), with the terms evaluated at retarded time. Thus, whichever form is presented as long as those terms are included.

Alternatively, confirm via Jefimenko's equations—wait, no, Jefimenko's equations are for E and B, and are different. But potentials are mostly derived from retarded potentials.

So the answer should be the expressions above. So going back, solidify the conclusion:

Scalar potential V(r,t) is [1/(4πε₀)] * [ q / ( d ( 1 - (v⋅d̂)/c ) ) ]

Vector potential A(r,t) is [μ₀/(4π)] * [ q v / ( d ( 1 - (v⋅d̂)/c ) ) ]

Thus, boxes around these with appropriate symbols, using \vec{d} as per the problem's notation. But in the denominator, d is |\vec{d}|. Hence it's necessary to clarify in the boxed expressions. To make the evaluation explicit:

$\vec{A}$ is a vector, so it remains with the velocity vector in the numerator.

So the denominator in both potentials is using d, which is the magnitude of vector \vec{d}, and this vector \vec{d} is from the retarded position of the charge to the observation point.

Hence, the answer is:

Scalar Potential, V:

$
V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \dfrac{q}{\left| \vec{d} \right| \left( 1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }{ c \left| \vec{d} \right| } \right) } }
$

Vector Potential, $\vec{A}$:

$
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{ \mu_0 }{4 \pi } \cdot \dfrac{ q \vec{v} }{ \left| \vec{d} \right| \left( 1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }{ c \left| \vec{d} \right| } \right) } }
$

That's the conclusion.

**Final Answer**
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \) are given by:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \dfrac{q}{\left| \vec{d} \right| \left( 1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }{ c \left| \vec{d} \right| } \right) } }
\]
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{ \mu_0 }{4 \pi } \cdot \dfrac{ q \vec{v} }{ \left| \vec{d} \right| \left( 1 - \dfrac{ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} }{ c \left| \vec{d} \right| } \right) } }
\]

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a position r and time t, created by a moving point charge q. The charge is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're using the origin as the reference frame. The key thing here is that the potentials at time t depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time tr, the retarded time, right? Because the electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light, so we have to account for that delay.

First, remember that in electrodynamics, the potentials are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. Those are the ones that take into account the retardation effect. Let me recall their form. The scalar potential V is usually something like [1/(4πε₀)] multiplied by the charge divided by the retarded distance minus the projection of the velocity (at the retarded time) onto the direction of the retarded position. But maybe it's better to write down the exact expressions.

Wait, so the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / (d * (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c)) ] evaluated at the retarded time tr.

Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / (d * (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c)) ] evaluated at tr.

But what are each of the variables here? Let me verify. In the problem statement, they defined d as the vector from the position of the charge at the retarded time tr to the observation point r. So, d is the vector pointing from s(tr) to r. So d = r - s(tr). The velocity v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, tr. So v = ds/dt evaluated at tr.

Then, d is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. So |d| is |r - s(tr)|, right? Then d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d. The term in the denominator, (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c), is the Doppler factor or the retardation factor. So it accounts for the fact that if the charge is moving towards the observation point, the potentials are enhanced, and if it's moving away, they're reduced.

Wait, but the denominator would be d - (v ⋅ d)/c, but since d is a vector, when taking the dot product with v, which is a vector, then (v ⋅ d) would be the scalar product. So actually, the retarded-time denominator has the term 1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c. So writing it as d * [1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c] makes sense. Therefore, the scalar potential is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q / [d (1 - v⋅d̂/c) ]) evaluated at tr.

Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v / [d (1 - v⋅d̂/c) ]) evaluated at tr.

But I also want to confirm notations and any possible alternative expressions. Another way to write this is using the retarded position, but since here they've defined d as the vector from s(tr) to r, perhaps this is consistent.

Wait, but sometimes the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are expressed in terms of the retarded position and velocity. Let me check units as well. Scalar potential has units of volts, which is N·m/C, and 1/(4πε₀) has units of N·m²/C². So q over (something with units of meters) would need the denominator to have units of meters. So (d (1 - v·d̂/c)) - since (v·d̂)/c is dimensionless, the denominator is in meters, which matches. Similarly for the vector potential, μ₀ has units of H/m, which is T·m/A, and the term (qv) would have units C·(m/s). So (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v / [d (1 - ...) ]) - with μ₀ in T·m/A, and (q v) in C·m/s, divide by meters, so (T·m/A) * (C·m/s) / m = T·m/A * C/s. Since 1 T = 1 N/(A·m), so substituting in, T·m/A = (N/(A·m)) * m/A = N/A². Then (N/A²) * (C/s). Since 1 C/s is Ampere, so A. Then (N/A²)*A = N/A. But the vector potential A is supposed to have units of T·m or Wb/m, but let me check:

The vector potential A is such that B = ∇×A, so B must have units of Tesla, and ∇ has units 1/m, so A must be Tesla·meter. Alternatively, in SI units, H (henry) is Wb/A, so 1 H = 1 Wb/A. The units of A are Wb/m. Let me compute the units for the expression (μ₀/(4π)) * ( q v / (distance * dimensionless )).

μ₀ has units H/m. q is in C. v is in m/s. Distance is in m. Then H/m * (C * m/s) / m = (H/m) * (C/(s)) because m/s divided by m is 1/(s). Since C/s is Ampere, A. Then H/m * A = (H·A)/m. But H is Wb/A, so H·A/m = Wb/(m) , since (Wb/A)*A = Wb, then divided by m. So Wb/m is indeed the unit of the vector potential. Check. That's correct.

Similarly, scalar potential V has units of volts. Checking the expression [1/(4πε₀)] * [q/(something)]. 1/(4πε₀) is in N·m²/C², times q (C) divided by something in meters. So (N·m²/C²) * C / m = N·m/C, which is J/C, and since V is J/C, that's correct. So the units check out.

Alternatively, another way to write these potentials is with the denominator term as d - (v ⋅ d)/c, but let's see. If we factor out d, then it's d(1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c), where d̂ = d

I need to determine the scalar potential V and vector potential A at position r and time t, generated by a point charge q moving along trajectory s(t), with the origin as our reference frame. The crucial concept is that potentials at time t are determined by the charge's state at an earlier time tr (retarded time), accounting for the finite propagation speed of electromagnetic fields.

In electrodynamics, these are described by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which incorporate the retardation effect. Let me recall their exact formulations.

The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are expressed as:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / (d * (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c)) ] evaluated at retarded time tr.

A(r, t) = (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / (d * (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c)) ] evaluated at retarded time tr.

I should clarify the variables: d represents the vector from the charge's position at retarded time tr to the observation point r, so d = r - s(tr). The velocity v is the charge's velocity at retarded time, thus v = ds/dt evaluated at tr.

The magnitude |d| equals |r - s(tr)|, and d̂ is the corresponding unit vector. The denominator term (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c) is the Doppler or retardation factor, enhancing potentials when the charge moves toward the observation point and reducing them when moving away.

The denominator includes (v ⋅ d̂), which is the scalar product of velocity v and unit vector d̂. So the scalar potential is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q / [d (1 - v⋅d̂/c) ]) evaluated at tr.

Similarly, the vector potential A = (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v / [d (1 - v⋅d̂/c) ]) evaluated at tr.

Let me verify the units. For scalar potential V (measured in volts or N·m/C), 1/(4πε₀) has units N·m²/C², q is in coulombs, and the denominator d(1 - v·d̂/c) has units of meters since (v·d̂)/c is dimensionless. So (N·m²/C²) * C / m = N·m/C, which is J/C or volts. This confirms the units are correct.

For vector potential A, μ₀ has units H/m (T·m/A), q is in C, v in m/s, and the denominator in meters. So (T·m/A) * (C·m/s) / m = (T·m/A) * (C/s) = (T·m/A) * A = (N/A²) * A = N/A. Since A should have units of T·m or Wb/m, I can verify: H/m * (C * m/s) / m = (H/m) * (C/s) = (H·A)/m = Wb/m, which is indeed correct.

Another way to write the denominator is d - (v ⋅ d)/c, which equals d(1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c) when we factor out d, where d̂ = d/|d|.

Alright, here's the rephrased text:

I need to determine the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a location r and time t, induced by a moving point charge q. The charge follows a path s(t), using the origin as the reference frame. An essential aspect is that the potentials at time t are reliant on the charge's state at an earlier time tr, referred to as the retarded time, due to the electromagnetic field traveling at light speed, which introduces a delay.

Initially, it's important to remember that in electrodynamics, the potentials are expressed via the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which consider the retardation effect. Let me note their structure. The scalar potential V is typically in the form of [1/(4πε₀)] multiplied by the charge divided by the retarded distance minus the component of the velocity (at the retarded time) projected along the retarded position's direction. However, it may be more effective to write down the precise formulas.

The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * [ q / (d * (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c)) ] evaluated at the retarded time tr.

Similarly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * [ q v / (d * (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c)) ] evaluated at tr.

Let me clarify the variables here. According to the problem statement, d is defined as the vector extending from the location of the charge at the retarded time tr to the observation point r. Thus, d is the vector from s(tr) to r. Therefore, d = r - s(tr). The velocity v represents the charge's velocity at the retarded time, tr, so v = ds/dt evaluated at tr.

Thus, d indicates the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. Therefore, |d| equals |r - s(tr)|. The unit vector in the direction of d is d̂. The term in the denominator, (1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c), is the Doppler or retardation factor. It accounts for the effect where potentials increase if the charge moves towards the observation point and decrease if moving away.

The denominator is actually d - (v ⋅ d)/c, but since d is a vector, the dot product with v (also a vector) turns (v ⋅ d) into a scalar. Therefore, the retarded-time denominator includes the term 1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c. Representing it as d * [1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c] makes sense. Hence, the scalar potential is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * ( q / [d (1 - v⋅d̂/c) ]) evaluated at tr.

Correspondingly, the vector potential A is (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v / [d (1 - v⋅d̂/c) ]) evaluated at tr.

Additionally, I want to verify the notations and any potential alternative expressions. Another way to express this is by using the retarded position. However, since d is defined as the vector from s(tr) to r here, this is consistent.

Sometimes, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are stated in terms of the retarded position and velocity. I'll also review the units. The scalar potential has units of volts, equivalent to N·m/C, and 1/(4πε₀) comes in N·m²/C². Therefore, q over (something with length units) should have a denominator with length units. Since (v·d̂)/c is dimensionless, the denominator is in meters, which aligns perfectly. The same applies to the vector potential, as μ₀ is in H/m or T·m/A, and the term (qv) in C·(m/s). The expression (μ₀/(4π)) * (q v / [d (1 - ...) ]) – where μ₀ is in T·m/A, and (qv) in C·m/s, divided by meters – results in (T·m/A) * (C/s)/m = T·m/A * C/s. Since 1 T = 1 N/(A·m), substituting in reveals T·m/A = (N/(A·m)) * m/A = N/A². This leads to (N/A²) * (C/s), and as C/s is in Amperes (A), we get (N/A²)*A = N/A. However, the vector potential should be measured in T·m or Wb/m, so let me confirm:

The vector potential A is related to B = ∇×A, hence B has units of Tesla, while ∇ is in 1/m, so A has units of Tesla·meter. Alternatively, in SI units, H (henry) is Wb/A, making 1 H = 1 Wb/A. Thus, the unit of A is Wb/m. Calculating the units for (μ₀/(4π)) * ( q v / (distance * dimensionless )) yields:

μ₀ with units of H/m, q in C, v in m/s, and distance in m, results in H/m * (C * m/s) / m = (H/m) * (C/(s)) since m/s divided by m is 1/(s). As C/s equates to Amperes, A, then H/m * A = (H·A)/m. Given that H is Wb/A, this equals Wb/m, because (Wb/A)*A = Wb, then divided by m. Thus Wb/m is indeed the unit for the vector potential, as confirmed.

Likewise, the scalar potential V is measured in volts. For [1/(4πε₀)] * [q/(something)], 1/(4πε₀) is in N·m²/C², multiplied by q (C) over something measured in meters. Hence, (N·m²/C²) * C / m = N·m/C, which is J/C, and V is consistently J/C, confirming its validity. The units match.

Alternatively, these potentials can also be expressed with the denominator as d - (v ⋅ d)/c, but consider this: if we factor out d, it's d(1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c), where d̂ is the unit vector of d.

So the same idea.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key point is that the denominator is not just the distance d, but that distance adjusted by the term (1 - v ⋅ d̂ / c), which accounts for the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. The retarded time tr is the time when the field "leaves" the charge and travels at speed c to reach the observation point r at time t. The relation between t and tr is tr = t - d/c, where d is the distance between the charge at tr and the observation point. However, in cases of moving charges, this is implicit in the solution because tr is determined by the equation |r - s(tr)| = c(t - tr). But in the case of a general trajectory, tr must be found from this equation, which can be complicated. However, the potentials themselves are given explicitly in terms of the retarded position and velocity.\n\nSo, writing down finally:\n\nThe scalar potential V(r, t) is given by\n\nV = \\frac{1}{4πε₀} \\left[ \\frac{q}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c d})} \\right]_{tr}\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential \\vec{A}(r, t) is\n\n\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu₀}{4π} \\left[ \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c d})} \\right]_{tr}\n\nBut note that (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}) / d is the component of the velocity in the direction of d, which is the direction from the charge\'s retarded position to the observation point. So, writing d̂ = \\vec{d}/d, we have (\\vec{v} \\cdot d̂). So, inserting that into the equation, the denominator becomes 1 - (\\vec{v} \\cdot d̂)/c.\n\nAlternatively, some sources write this denominator as (1 - \\vec{\\beta} \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{d}}), where β = v/c. So the denominator is indeed d (1 - (\\vec{v} \\cdot d̂)/c).\n\nAlternatively, keeping it in terms of \\vec{d}, since (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}) / c is (v*d*cosθ)/c, where θ is the angle between d and v, but in our formulation, since we have (\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}) / (c d), that\'s equivalent to (v cosθ)/c.\n\nTherefore, putting all that together, since the problem statement defined d as the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, which we have used in the potentials. The key point is that even though the potentials are evaluated at time t, they depend on the state of the charge at time tr, where tr = t - d/c, but only if d were constant. However, in reality, tr has to satisfy the implicit equation t = tr + |r - s(tr)| / c.\n\nBut since the problem states that we should focus on the potentials given that t > tr, but doesn\'t require solving for tr, since tr is known in terms of the equation. However, in the expressions of the potentials provided, we just need to express them using the given variables.\n\nTherefore, according to the problem statement definitions, the required potentials are as above.\n\nWait, but also consider that dielectric permittivity ε₀ and magnetic permeability μ₀ are specified, and speed of light c is in vacuum, which relates to μ₀ and ε₀ through c = 1 / √(μ₀ ε₀). But I just need to present the expressions with these constants properly placed.\n\nIn their standard forms, Liénard-Wiechert potentials use these constants.\n\nYes, as I have written before.\n\nHence, the scalar potential V(r, t) is:\n\nV(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{4 π ε₀} \\frac{q}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c d})} evaluated at tr\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\nV = \\frac{1}{4 π ε₀} \\left( \\frac{q}{(d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c})} \\right)_{tr}\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential \\vec{A} is:\n\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu₀}{4 π} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c d})} evaluated at tr\n\nwhich simplifies as well:\n\n\\vec{A} = \\frac{\\mu₀}{4 π} \\left( \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{d}}{c}} \\right)_{tr}\n\nSince the problem asks to use the notation c, ε₀, μ₀. Yes. So this should be the answer.\n\nWait, but sometimes I see the retarded denominator written as (1 - \\vec{\\beta} \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{d}} ) with β = v /c. But maybe the direction has to be considered. Let me make sure.\n\nIf \\vec{d} is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, then d̂ is \\vec{d}/d. If \\vec{v} is the velocity at the retarded time, then \\vec{v} ⋅ d̂ is the speed towards the observation point. If the term in denominator is 1 - [\\vec{v} ⋅ d̂]/c. That term could also be written as 1 - \\vec{\\beta} ⋅ d̂, with β = v/c.\n\nHowever, the problem uses \\vec{v}, which is velocity in m/s.\n\nSo, in both potentials, V and A, the denominator has d multiplied by (1 - the component of velocity towards the observation point divided by c).\n\nHence, the answer would be precisely as written above.\n\nI don\'t see any mistakes here.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) due to a moving point charge \( q \) are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. These potentials account for the retarded time \( t_r \), which is the time when the electromagnetic field was emitted from the charge to reach the observation point \( \vec{r} \) at time \( t \).

The retarded position of the charge is \( \vec{s}(t_r) \), and the vector from this position to the observation point is \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \). The velocity of the charge at the retarded time is \( \vec{v} \).

The scalar potential \( V \) is:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} \right)_{\text{ret}}
\]
where \( d = |\vec{d}| \) and \( \hat{d} = \frac{\vec{d}}{d} \).

The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is:
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} \right)_{\text{ret}}
\]

Both potentials are evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \), ensuring that the effects of the charge's motion and the finite speed of light \( c \) are properly accounted for.

### Final Answer
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) are:
\[
\boxed{ V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} \right)_{\text{ret}} }
\]
\[
\boxed{ \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} \right)_{\text{ret}} }
\]
where \( \hat{d} = \frac{\vec{d}}{d} \), and all quantities are evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 / d. So yes, so if the original term is d - (v ⋅ d)/c, and since d divided by |d| is d̂, then (v ⋅ d) is v ⋅ d̂ * d. So that term becomes d - (v ⋅ d)/c = d(1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c). So both expressions are equivalent.

So in the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which are:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4πε₀} \left( \frac{q}{(d - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c})} \right)

and

\vec{A}(r, t) = \frac{\mu₀}{4π} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{d - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}} \right)

But due to causality, all quantities (d and v) are evaluated at the retarded time tr. Wait, but in many textbooks, people use the notation R = |r - s(tr)|, and β = v/c, so the expression becomes 1/(1 - β ⋅ \hat{R}) R. So the same idea.

Therefore, the answer is the Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The key point is that the denominator is not just the distance d, but that distance adjusted by the term (1 - v ⋅ d̂ / c), which accounts for the velocity of the charge at the retarded time. The retarded time tr is the time when the field "leaves" the charge and travels at speed c to reach the observation point r at time t. The relation between t and tr is tr = t - d/c, where d is the distance between the charge at tr and the observation point. However, in cases of moving charges, this is implicit in the solution because tr is determined by the equation |r - s(tr)| = c(t - tr). But in the case of a general trajectory, tr must be found from this equation, which can be complicated. However, the potentials themselves are given explicitly in terms of the retarded position and velocity.

So, writing down finally:

The scalar potential V(r, t) is given by

V = \frac{1}{4πε₀} \left[ \frac{q}{d (1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c d})} \right]_{tr}

Similarly, the vector potential \vec{A}(r, t) is

\vec{A} = \frac{\mu₀}{4π} \left[ \frac{q \vec{v}}{d (1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c d})} \right]_{tr}

But note that (\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}) / d is the component of the velocity in the direction of d, which is the direction from the charge's retarded position to the observation point. So, writing d̂ = \vec{d}/d, we have (\vec{v} \cdot d̂). So, inserting that into the equation, the denominator becomes 1 - (\vec{v} \cdot d̂)/c.

Alternatively, some sources write this denominator as (1 - \vec{\beta} \cdot \hat{\vec{d}}), where β = v/c. So the denominator is indeed d (1 - (\vec{v} \cdot d̂)/c).

Alternatively, keeping it in terms of \vec{d}, since (\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}) / c is (v*d*cosθ)/c, where θ is the angle between d and v, but in our formulation, since we have (\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}) / (c d), that's equivalent to (v cosθ)/c.

Therefore, putting all that together, since the problem statement defined d as the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, which we have used in the potentials. The key point is that even though the potentials are evaluated at time t, they depend on the state of the charge at time tr, where tr = t - d/c, but only if d were constant. However, in reality, tr has to satisfy the implicit equation t = tr + |r - s(tr)| / c.

But since the problem states that we should focus on the potentials given that t > tr, but doesn't require solving for tr, since tr is known in terms of the equation. However, in the expressions of the potentials provided, we just need to express them using the given variables.

Therefore, according to the problem statement definitions, the required potentials are as above.

Wait, but also consider that dielectric permittivity ε₀ and magnetic permeability μ₀ are specified, and speed of light c is in vacuum, which relates to μ₀ and ε₀ through c = 1 / √(μ₀ ε₀). But I just need to present the expressions with these constants properly placed.

In their standard forms, Liénard-Wiechert potentials use these constants.

Yes, as I have written before.

Hence, the scalar potential V(r, t) is:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 π ε₀} \frac{q}{d (1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c d})} evaluated at tr

which simplifies to:

V = \frac{1}{4 π ε₀} \left( \frac{q}{(d - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c})} \right)_{tr}

Similarly, the vector potential \vec{A} is:

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu₀}{4 π} \frac{q \vec{v}}{d (1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c d})} evaluated at tr

which simplifies as well:

\vec{A} = \frac{\mu₀}{4 π} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{d - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}} \right)_{tr}

Since the problem asks to use the notation c, ε₀, μ₀. Yes. So this should be the answer.

Wait, but sometimes I see the retarded denominator written as (1 - \vec{\beta} \cdot \hat{\vec{d}} ) with β = v /c. But maybe the direction has to be considered. Let me make sure.

If \vec{d} is the vector from the retarded position to the observation point, then d̂ is \vec{d}/d. If \vec{v} is the velocity at the retarded time, then \vec{v} ⋅ d̂ is the speed towards the observation point. If the term in denominator is 1 - [\vec{v} ⋅ d̂]/c. That term could also be written as 1 - \vec{\beta} ⋅ d̂, with β = v/c.

However, the problem uses \vec{v}, which is velocity in m/s.

So, in both potentials, V and A, the denominator has d multiplied by (1 - the component of velocity towards the observation point divided by c).

Hence, the answer would be precisely as written above.

I don't see any mistakes here. The formulation takes into account the retarded time, the velocity at retarded time, and the position at retarded time via vector d = r - s(tr). So, I think this is correct.

**Final Answer**
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at time \( t \) and position \( \vec{r} \) are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials:
\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left[ \frac{q}{(d - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c})} \right]_{\text{ret}}
\]
\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \left[ \frac{q \vec{v}}{(d - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c})} \right]_{\text{ret}}
\]
where the subscript "ret" indicates evaluation at the retarded time \( t_r \), \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \), and \( d = |\vec{d}| \).

So, boxed answers:
Scalar potential:
\boxed{ V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c d}\right)} \right)_{\text{ret}} }

Vector potential:
\boxed{ \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c d}\right)} \right)_{\text{ret}} }

Alternatively, simplifying the denominator:
Since \(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} = v d \cos\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{d}\), so \( \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c d} = \frac{v \cos\theta}{c} = \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c} \), which can be represented as \(\frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c d}\).

But per the problem instruction, using the notation as given, this should be acceptable. The key is \vec{d} is the vector from retarded position to field point.

Another way to present:
\boxed{ V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{d - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}} \right)_{\text{ret}} }
\boxed{ \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{d - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{d}}{c}} \right)_{\text{ret}} }

Either form is correct because whether you write d*(1 - ...) or expand as d - ... is the same.

So, perhaps the second boxed forms are cleaner.


**Final Answer**
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) are:
\[
\boxed{ V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} \right)_{\text{ret}} }
\]
\[
\boxed{ \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \left( \frac{q \vec{v}}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} \right)_{\text{ret}} }
\]
where \( \hat{d} = \frac{\vec{d}}{d} \), and all quantities are evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \).

The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \), arising from a point charge \( q \) moving along trajectory \( \vec{s}(t) \), are given by the **Liénard-Wiechert potentials**. These potentials account for the finite propagation speed of electromagnetic disturbances (retardation effects). Here, \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \) is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, \( t_r \) is the retarded time (determined implicitly by \( t = t_r + |\vec{d}|/c \)), and \( \vec{v} = \dot{\vec{s}}(t_r) \) is the velocity of the charge at \( t_r \). The potentials are:

\[
\boxed{
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{d \left( 1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c} \right)} \quad \text{and} \quad \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{d \left( 1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c} \right)},
}
\]

where:
- \( d = |\vec{d}| = |\vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r)| \),
- \( \hat{d} = \vec{d}/d \),
- The terms are evaluated at the **retarded time** \( t_r \),
- The factor \( 1 - (\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d})/c \) accounts for relativistic Doppler effects.

These formulas describe the potentials for a charge in arbitrary motion, incorporating retardation and velocity-dependent effects. Acceleration terms do not appear in the potentials themselves but contribute to the derived electric and magnetic fields.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 That matches.

Are there any conditions? The denominators involve 1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c, which implies that if the charge is moving towards the observation point (v ⋅ d̂ positive), the potential increases, a phenomenon called the Doppler boost. At non-relativistic speeds, the denominator approximates 1, leading to the static Coulomb potential scaled by 1/(4πε₀).

Also, note that these potentials depend on the state of the charge at the retarded time tr, which is determined by the requirement that a light signal emitted from s(tr) at time tr would reach the observation point r at time t. So tr is implicitly defined by t = tr + |r - s(tr)|/c.

But since the question specifies expressing V and A in terms of tr, that's perhaps as per the problem's instruction. So the answer would use the retarded position and velocity.

To confirm that I'm not missing other terms, like acceleration-dependent terms. Wait, Liénard-Wiechert potentials do include velocity and acceleration, but the acceleration terms are in the expression for the electric field, not the potentials. Let me check.

Wait, no, the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a point charge in arbitrary motion contain terms dependent on the velocity (not acceleration) evaluated at the retarded time. The acceleration contributions come in when you compute the electric and magnetic fields from the potentials, involving derivatives with respect to time and space.

So for potentials V and A themselves, only the velocity at retarded time is needed, and not the acceleration. Hence, the acceleration terms are not present in the expressions I wrote earlier.

Alternatively, in some derivations, when phrased in terms of the present position, you get different expressions. But in the retarded formalism (i.e., with tr), velocity refers to tr's time.

Therefore, integrating all, the expressions correspond to the Liénard-Wiechert potentials correctly.

Conclusion: The scalar potential and vector potential due to a moving charge are given using the retarded quantities. Specifying with the fields' observed point r and time t, as the charge's retarded position and velocity are considered. The formulae involve 1/(denominator with (1 - v⋅d̂/c)), the retardation factor.

Thus, our conclusion is consistent.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in terms of the retarded quantities. So, the terms s(tr), v(tr) are evaluated at the retarded time tr, which is related to the observed time t as t = tr + d/c. Therefore, when t is given, tr is found such that the time taken for the electromagnetic influence from the charge reaches the observation point at t, so tr = t - d/c. However, since d is |r - s(tr)|, this equation for tr becomes implicit, leading to possible complexities in calculating it. Yet, in the formulas for V and A, they are expressed in terms of tr, where all quantities (s, v) are evaluated.\n\nGiven the problem does not request tr, just wants the expressions in the correct terms for answering, requiring substitution:\n\nThe scalar and vector potentials at (r, t) are derived using the charge\'s position, velocity, and the displacement vector at the retarded time tr. So, with d = r - s(tr), and v = ds/dt at tr. So if they\'re asking for the expressions as given, that\'s these equations:\n\nV(r,t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c})}\n\nA(r,t) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{q \\vec{v}}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c})}\n\nbut everything here is evaluated at tr. So in terms of mathematics, this would be:\n\nV(r, t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[\\frac{q}{d (1 - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}/c)} \\right]_{tr}\n\nand similarly for A(r, t).\n\nTherefore, that should do it. But to ensure my replication avoids error, better recall.\n\nFirst, the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:\n\nV(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{ (1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c ) \\|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_s \\|} \\right)_{retarded}\n\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{ \\vec{v} }{ (1 - \\hat{n} \\cdot \\vec{v}/c ) \\|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r}_s \\| } \\right)_{retarded}\n\nHere, \\vec{r}_s is the position of the charge at retarded time, and \\hat{n} is the unit vector from the charge\'s retarded position to the field point \\vec{r}. In this problem definition, d is the vector from the charge\'s retarded position to the observation point, meaning d = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r), thus \\|d\\| = |\\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)|, and \\hat{d} = d / \\|d\\|. Then, substituting the conventions here, \\hat{n} is replaced by \\hat{d}, such that:\n\nV(r, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{d (1 - \\frac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c})} \\right] evaluated at t_r.\n\nSimilarly for A, hence:\n\n\\vec{A}(r, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0 q}{4\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{ \\vec{v} }{ d (1 - \\frac{ \\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d} }{c}) } \\right] evaluated at t_r.\n\nSo yes, then that is the formula. So that should be correct. Possibly, these are the correct expressions to that given problem.\n\nBut an essential caveat is that these expressions require the understanding that the quantities are evaluated at the retarded time tr and also the position at tr. Alternatively, one might be concerned about the distinction between d being a vector vs magnitude here. The denominator in the denominator here:\n\nIn the presentation, "where \\vec{d} is the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time tr...", meaning \\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr).\n\nTherefore in the formula for the potentials, d (the magnitude) would be ‖\\vec{d}‖: each denominator is the product d (which is ‖\\vec{d}‖) multiplied by (1 - v ⋅ \\hat{d}/c).\n\nHence, in order to avoid confusion, replacing with the symbols given in the problem.\n\nBut in the problem\'s notation, "d = vector from generation point (charge at tr) to observation point."\n\nThus, the potentials should be written with the denominator given as d (the magnitude) multiplied by (1 - velocity component along d divided by c). Therefore the expression has both the factor 1/d as well as 1/(1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c).\n\nHence, the answer is correct as inferred earlier.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is:\n\nThe scalar potential V is (\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0}) multiplied by q divided by [d multiplied by (1 - (v ⋅ \\hat{d} ) / c )], with all quantities evaluated at tr. Similarly, the vector potential A is (\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi}) multiplied by q v divided by [d multiplied by (1 - (v ⋅ \\hat{d} ) / c ) ].\n\nHence, the boxed expressions:\n\nV(\\vec{r}, t) = \\boxed{ \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{d \\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}\\right)} }\n\n\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\boxed{ \\dfrac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\dfrac{q \\vec{v}}{d \\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\vec{v} \\cdot \\hat{d}}{c}\\right)} }\n\nBut considering unit vectors, it\'s important that \\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d. Since \\vec{d} is given in the problem (as from charge location at tr to observation point), but wasn\'t the OP using d for its magnitude? Wait: the problem statement says that \\vec{d} is the vector generated at the earlier time. So in their notation, \\vec{d} is the vector, so |\\vec{d}| would be distance. Therefore, $\\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(t_r)$, hence $d = |\\vec{d}|$. Then, in the answer, you need to use d as the magnitude. However, in the denominator we have d*(1 - \\vec{v} ⋅ \\hat{d}/c) where \\hat{d} = \\vec{d}/d.\n\nBut in the problem\'s notation, perhaps is in terms of $\\vec{d}$ rather than its magnitude ? Let\'s check again.\n\nProblem states:\n\n"Let $\\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\\vec{r}$."\n\nSo indeed, \\vec{d} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{s}(tr), so derivative at tr is pointing from the retarded position to the field point. Therefore, the magnitude is d. So, in terms of the denominator, we use the scalar quantity d multiplied by (1 - \\vec{v} ⋅ \\hat{d}/c). Therefore, that cross-check holds, the answer is as above.\n\nOne more thing: reviewing cross terms. Liénard-Wiechert potentially have other terms in denominator, but no; the denominator is indeed (now in another convention) R − (R ⋅ v)/c where R is the vector from retarded position. Wait, could that apply here? Or is the denominator expressed as distance and then velocity\'s projection.\n\nWait I need to verify the exact formula. Let me consult from a textbook perspective. For example, Jackson\'s Classical Electrodynamics:\n\nThe Liénard-Wiechert potentials are written as:\n\nV(r,t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{R - \\vec{\\beta} \\cdot \\vec{R} },  \nA(r,t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 c} \\frac{\\vec{\\beta}}{R - \\vec{\\beta} \\cdot \\vec{R} }\n\nwhere \\vec{\\beta} = \\vec{v}/c, and R is evaluated at the retarded time, from the charge\'s position to the field point.\n\nBut R is the magnitude of \\vec{R}, and \\vec{R} is \\vec{r} - \\vec{r}\'(t_r), which is the same as \\vec{d} in this problem. So in Jackson\'s notation, the denominator is R (1 - \\vec{\\beta} ⋅ \\hat{R}), which equates to R (1 - (v/c) ⋅ \\hat{R}).\n\nIn our problem, since \\vec{d} = \\vec{R}, then  \\vec{\\beta} ⋅ \\vec{R} is (v/c) ⋅ \\vec{R} = derivative v * R * cos(theta). Therefore, they define the denominator as R - (v ⋅ R)/c = R (1 - (v ⋅ \\hat{R}/c)) , which aligns with the above. Therefore, in our cases, the denominator would then be d (1 - v ⋅ \\hat{d}/c ), as in the initial answer.\n\nSo, if Jackson expresses it as the reciprocal of [ R (1 - \\vec{\\beta} ⋅ \\hat{R}) ], then indeed our scalar potential is:\n\nV = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / [ R (1 - (v ⋅ \\hat{R})/c ) ]\n\nSimilarly, the vector potential is ( μ₀ /4π )* q v / [ R (1 - (v ⋅ \\hat{R}/c ) ]\n\nSince the problem uses d for R, and variables as defined, substitution leads to V and A being as boxed.\n\nHence, this should suffice. The key is you need to consider retardation and the velocity at retarded time. Also, the denominator factor accounts for the Doppler effect or the beaming effect associated with the motion toward the observer. Therefore, the transmission of fields at speed of light is already shunted into the expressions through the retarded time.\n\nAnother way to recall: If the charge is not moving, v = 0, then the potentials revert to static potentials: V = q/(4πε₀ d) and A=0.

To determine the scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \) due to a moving point charge \( q \), we need to consider the retarded time \( t_r \) when the electromagnetic field was generated. The potentials are given by the Liénard-Wiechert potentials, which account for the finite speed of light and the relative motion of the charge.

The key steps are as follows:

1. **Retarded Quantities**: The vector \( \vec{d} \) is defined as the displacement from the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), i.e., \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \). The magnitude of this vector is \( d = |\vec{d}| \), and the unit vector in the direction of \( \vec{d} \) is \( \hat{d} = \vec{d}/d \).

2. **Velocity Factor Correction**: The velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge at the retarded time \( t_r \) introduces a Doppler or retardation factor in the denominator. This factor is \( 1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum.

3. **Scalar Potential**: The scalar potential \( V \) is derived from the charge \( q \) adjusted by the retardation factor and the distance \( d \):

\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)}
\]

4. **Vector Potential**: The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) incorporates both the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and the same retardation factor:

\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{d \left(1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)}
\]

Both potentials are evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \), ensuring that the effects of the charge's motion and the finite propagation speed of the electromagnetic fields are correctly accounted for.

### Final Answer
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \) are given by:

\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{d \left(1 - \dfrac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} }
\]

\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \dfrac{q \vec{v}}{d \left(1 - \dfrac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} }
\]

where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \), \( d = |\vec{d}| \), \( \hat{d} = \dfrac{\vec{d}}{d} \), and all quantities are evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \).

 Therefore, both forms are equivalent, and using the equation given in the problem’s notation, which incorporates d as the vector from the retarded position to the observation point.

Double-checking the Liénard-Wiechert expressions versus standard references:

Yes, standard expressions for the Liénard-Wiechert potentials typically include the term (1 - n̂ ⋅ β) in the denominator, where β = v/c and n̂ is the unit vector from the retarded position to the observation point. Thus, our conclusion is consistent.

Another aspect to consider is that the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are given in terms of the retarded quantities. So, the terms s(tr), v(tr) are evaluated at the retarded time tr, which is related to the observed time t as t = tr + d/c. Therefore, when t is given, tr is found such that the time taken for the electromagnetic influence from the charge reaches the observation point at t, so tr = t - d/c. However, since d is |r - s(tr)|, this equation for tr becomes implicit, leading to possible complexities in calculating it. Yet, in the formulas for V and A, they are expressed in terms of tr, where all quantities (s, v) are evaluated.

Given the problem does not request tr, just wants the expressions in the correct terms for answering, requiring substitution:

The scalar and vector potentials at (r, t) are derived using the charge's position, velocity, and the displacement vector at the retarded time tr. So, with d = r - s(tr), and v = ds/dt at tr. So if they're asking for the expressions as given, that's these equations:

V(r,t) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{d (1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c})}

A(r,t) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q \vec{v}}{d (1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c})}

but everything here is evaluated at tr. So in terms of mathematics, this would be:

V(r, t) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \left[\frac{q}{d (1 - \vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}/c)} \right]_{tr}

and similarly for A(r, t).

Therefore, that should do it. But to ensure my replication avoids error, better recall.

First, the standard Liénard-Wiechert potentials are:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \left( \frac{1}{ (1 - \hat{n} \cdot \vec{v}/c ) \|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_s \|} \right)_{retarded}

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q}{4\pi} \left( \frac{ \vec{v} }{ (1 - \hat{n} \cdot \vec{v}/c ) \|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_s \| } \right)_{retarded}

Here, \vec{r}_s is the position of the charge at retarded time, and \hat{n} is the unit vector from the charge's retarded position to the field point \vec{r}. In this problem definition, d is the vector from the charge's retarded position to the observation point, meaning d = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r), thus \|d\| = |\vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r)|, and \hat{d} = d / \|d\|. Then, substituting the conventions here, \hat{n} is replaced by \hat{d}, such that:

V(r, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \left[ \frac{1}{d (1 - \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c})} \right] evaluated at t_r.

Similarly for A, hence:

\vec{A}(r, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q}{4\pi} \left[ \frac{ \vec{v} }{ d (1 - \frac{ \vec{v} \cdot \hat{d} }{c}) } \right] evaluated at t_r.

So yes, then that is the formula. So that should be correct. Possibly, these are the correct expressions to that given problem.

But an essential caveat is that these expressions require the understanding that the quantities are evaluated at the retarded time tr and also the position at tr. Alternatively, one might be concerned about the distinction between d being a vector vs magnitude here. The denominator in the denominator here:

In the presentation, "where \vec{d} is the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time tr...", meaning \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(tr).

Therefore in the formula for the potentials, d (the magnitude) would be ‖\vec{d}‖: each denominator is the product d (which is ‖\vec{d}‖) multiplied by (1 - v ⋅ \hat{d}/c).

Hence, in order to avoid confusion, replacing with the symbols given in the problem.

But in the problem's notation, "d = vector from generation point (charge at tr) to observation point."

Thus, the potentials should be written with the denominator given as d (the magnitude) multiplied by (1 - velocity component along d divided by c). Therefore the expression has both the factor 1/d as well as 1/(1 - (v ⋅ d̂)/c).

Hence, the answer is correct as inferred earlier.

Therefore, my conclusion is:

The scalar potential V is (\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}) multiplied by q divided by [d multiplied by (1 - (v ⋅ \hat{d} ) / c )], with all quantities evaluated at tr. Similarly, the vector potential A is (\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi}) multiplied by q v divided by [d multiplied by (1 - (v ⋅ \hat{d} ) / c ) ].

Hence, the boxed expressions:

V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{d \left(1 - \dfrac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} }

\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \dfrac{q \vec{v}}{d \left(1 - \dfrac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} }

But considering unit vectors, it's important that \hat{d} = \vec{d}/d. Since \vec{d} is given in the problem (as from charge location at tr to observation point), but wasn't the OP using d for its magnitude? Wait: the problem statement says that \vec{d} is the vector generated at the earlier time. So in their notation, \vec{d} is the vector, so |\vec{d}| would be distance. Therefore, $\vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r)$, hence $d = |\vec{d}|$. Then, in the answer, you need to use d as the magnitude. However, in the denominator we have d*(1 - \vec{v} ⋅ \hat{d}/c) where \hat{d} = \vec{d}/d.

But in the problem's notation, perhaps is in terms of $\vec{d}$ rather than its magnitude ? Let's check again.

Problem states:

"Let $\vec{d}$ be the vector from the point where the electromagnetic field was generated at some earlier time $tr$ to the observation point $\vec{r}$."

So indeed, \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(tr), so derivative at tr is pointing from the retarded position to the field point. Therefore, the magnitude is d. So, in terms of the denominator, we use the scalar quantity d multiplied by (1 - \vec{v} ⋅ \hat{d}/c). Therefore, that cross-check holds, the answer is as above.

One more thing: reviewing cross terms. Liénard-Wiechert potentially have other terms in denominator, but no; the denominator is indeed (now in another convention) R − (R ⋅ v)/c where R is the vector from retarded position. Wait, could that apply here? Or is the denominator expressed as distance and then velocity's projection.

Wait I need to verify the exact formula. Let me consult from a textbook perspective. For example, Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics:

The Liénard-Wiechert potentials are written as:

V(r,t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{1}{R - \vec{\beta} \cdot \vec{R} },  
A(r,t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 c} \frac{\vec{\beta}}{R - \vec{\beta} \cdot \vec{R} }

where \vec{\beta} = \vec{v}/c, and R is evaluated at the retarded time, from the charge's position to the field point.

But R is the magnitude of \vec{R}, and \vec{R} is \vec{r} - \vec{r}'(t_r), which is the same as \vec{d} in this problem. So in Jackson's notation, the denominator is R (1 - \vec{\beta} ⋅ \hat{R}), which equates to R (1 - (v/c) ⋅ \hat{R}).

In our problem, since \vec{d} = \vec{R}, then  \vec{\beta} ⋅ \vec{R} is (v/c) ⋅ \vec{R} = derivative v * R * cos(theta). Therefore, they define the denominator as R - (v ⋅ R)/c = R (1 - (v ⋅ \hat{R}/c)) , which aligns with the above. Therefore, in our cases, the denominator would then be d (1 - v ⋅ \hat{d}/c ), as in the initial answer.

So, if Jackson expresses it as the reciprocal of [ R (1 - \vec{\beta} ⋅ \hat{R}) ], then indeed our scalar potential is:

V = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / [ R (1 - (v ⋅ \hat{R})/c ) ]

Similarly, the vector potential is ( μ₀ /4π )* q v / [ R (1 - (v ⋅ \hat{R}/c ) ]

Since the problem uses d for R, and variables as defined, substitution leads to V and A being as boxed.

Hence, this should suffice. The key is you need to consider retardation and the velocity at retarded time. Also, the denominator factor accounts for the Doppler effect or the beaming effect associated with the motion toward the observer. Therefore, the transmission of fields at speed of light is already shunted into the expressions through the retarded time.

Another way to recall: If the charge is not moving, v = 0, then the potentials revert to static potentials: V = q/(4πε₀ d) and A=0. If it's moving with constant velocity towards the observation point, then potential increases by the factor (1 - v ⋅ \hat{d}/c ) in denominator — hence, as if the observer sees a higher potential if charge approaches. So constitute the relativistic Doppler shift akin factor. So all checks support that these expressions are correct and standard.


**Final Answer**
The scalar potential \( V \) and vector potential \( \vec{A} \) at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t \) are given by:

\[
V(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \dfrac{q}{d \left(1 - \dfrac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} }
\]

\[
\vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \boxed{ \dfrac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \dfrac{q \vec{v}}{d \left(1 - \dfrac{\vec{v} \cdot \hat{d}}{c}\right)} }
\]

where \( \vec{d} = \vec{r} - \vec{s}(t_r) \), \( d = |\vec{d}| \), \( \hat{d} = \dfrac{\vec{d}}{d} \), and all quantities are evaluated at the retarded time \( t_r \).
