# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in the laboratory when the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

1. **Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \) where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.
2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: When transforming the speed of light from the glass's rest frame to the laboratory frame (where the glass is moving at velocity \( v \)), we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), \( c = 1 \), and we substitute these values into the formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the speed of light in glass as observed by someone in the laboratory, when the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The refractive index of the glass is n, and the speed of light in a vacuum is set to c=1. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basics here. 

First, normally, without any movement of the glass, the speed of light in the glass would just be c divided by the refractive index, right? So that's 1/n. But now the glass is moving, which probably means we need to consider some kind of velocity addition between the light's speed in the glass and the glass's speed relative to the lab frame. I remember something about Galilean vs. Einsteinian velocity addition. Since we’re dealing with light, which involves high speeds, we should probably use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think.

Wait, even in the case of Galilean relativity, if the glass is moving with velocity v, and the light is moving at speed u' = 1/n in the glass's frame, then the speed in the lab frame would be u = u' + v. But since the speed of light is involved, this might be a problem because in special relativity velocities don't just add linearly. The Galilean addition is an approximation at low speeds, but in reality, when velocities are significant fractions of c, we need the proper relativistic formula. 

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). Since c=1 here, that simplifies to (u' + v)/(1 + u' v). Since the light's speed in the glass's rest frame is u' = 1/n, substituting that in would give us (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) * v). But wait, in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is 1/n. So when the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, we need to apply the Lorentz transformation to get the light's speed in the lab frame. Let me confirm that.

Alternatively, maybe this is a situation where the medium's motion affects the effective speed of light. I think Fizeau's experiment deals with the speed of light in a moving medium, such as water flowing through a pipe. His experiment's results showed that the speed of light in the moving medium is not simply the sum of the speed of light in the medium and the medium's velocity, but instead a combination that involves the medium’s refractive index. The formula from Fizeau's experiment is u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²), or something like that?

Wait, I need to cross-verify. So from Fizeau's experiment, when a medium with refractive index n moves with speed v along the direction of light propagation, the observed speed of light u is approximately u ≈ c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). However, this was before special relativity, and Einstein later showed that this result is a consequence of relativistic velocity addition. 

Right, so the exact relativistic formula would give us a different expression, while Fizeau's formula is an approximation valid for low velocities. Let's recall both approaches. 

First, Fizeau's formula: If the medium is moving with velocity v in the lab frame, then the speed of light in the lab frame is (c/n) + v*(1 - 1/n²). This can be written as u = (1/n) + v*(1 - 1/n²). Given that c=1 here.

Alternatively, according to special relativity, we should use the velocity addition formula. If in the medium's rest frame, the speed of light is u' = 1/n. Then to find u in the lab frame where the medium is moving at v, relative to the lab we have:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v). Substituting u'=1/n and since c=1,

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

But how does this compare to Fizeau's result? Let's expand it using binomial approximation for v << 1. Let's take such a case where v is much smaller than c (which is 1), then:

( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v/n) ) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n + (v/n)^2 - ... )

≈ (1/n)(1 - v/n) + v(1 - v/n) + higher terms 

= 1/n - v/n² + v - v²/n 

≈ 1/n + v - v/n².

If we neglect the quadratic terms in v, then it's approximately 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²). So the relativistic formula reduces to Fizeau's approximate result for small velocities. 

But since the problem didn't specify that the glass is moving at a non-relativistic speed, we might need to consider the exact relativistic formula. However, depending on the question's intention, it might expect either Fizeau's result or the full relativistic velocity addition. Let me check resources.

Wait, I think the refractive index already involves the medium's effect on light speed, but when the medium is moving, we have to take into account relativistic effects. However, there's a distinction here: Does the refractive index depend on the frame?

Alternatively, maybe when someone says "the index of refraction is n", that is in the rest frame of the medium. So in that case, the speed of light in that frame is u'=1/n. Then, using the relativistic velocity addition formula, we can compute the speed in the lab frame as (u'+v)/(1+u' v). Therefore unless told otherwise, the refractive index is defined in the medium's rest frame.

However, another perspective: In a moving medium, the effective refractive index can be different. There might be an approach similar to that of the Fresnel drag coefficient. 

Alternatively, here's another approach: The phase velocity of light in a medium is v_p = c/n. When the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction, relativistic velocity addition applies. But phase velocity does not necessarily obey the same addition rule as particle velocities. Wait, phase velocity and group velocity? Hmm, this gets more complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps using Lorentz transformations on the electromagnetic fields in the medium. But that might be more involved. 

Alternatively, thinking about the speed of light in a moving medium as the result of two contributions: velocity of the medium and velocity of light in the medium. I think that Fizeau's result gives the correct expression supported by experiments, which is u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²), even though it can be derived using relativistic velocity addition if you take into account the relativistic contraction and time dilation.

Alternatively, maybe when the medium moves at velocity v, the effective speed is approximately (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²), so in terms of c=1, it's (1/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). If so, then maybe that's the answer expected here.

But the exact relativistic formula would be u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v). Let's compute it. Suppose n=2 and v=0.5, then according to Fizeau it's 0.5 + 0.5*(1 - 0.25) = 0.5 + 0.375 = 0.875. According to the velocity addition formula, it's (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1/1.25 = 0.8. So different results. But in reality, what is the case?

Wait, the Fizeau experiment confirmed the formula with the 1 - 1/n² term, but actually it's a first-order approximation of the relativistic velocity addition formula. In reality, with relativistic corrections, velocity addition must be used. However, I might be mixing up the drag coefficient and velocity addition here. Let me check what variables are involved. The problem just states an index of refraction n in the glass. The glass is moving at speed v in the same direction as the light. So perhaps the standard approach here is to use the relativistic velocity addition.

Yes. Because velocity addition is about transforming velocities between frames. The rest frame of the glass (moving at speed v in the lab frame) assigns a light speed of c/n. So lab frame observes speed as (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/n)v/c²). But since c=1, this would become (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Alternatively, I think if the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, then in the glass's rest frame, where the speed of light is 1/n, to get to the lab frame we need to calculate the velocity using the Lorentz transformation. The formula for the velocity addition is indeed:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v)

with u' being the speed in the moving frame (glass frame), v is the speed of the moving frame (glass) relative to lab.

Since in the glass's frame, speed of light is u' = 1/n (assuming that's defined in the rest frame), then in lab frame, speed is (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v).

Thus the answer should be this expression.

Wait, if so, then in that above case (n=2, v=0.5 c), we get (0.5 + 0.5) / (1 + 0.25) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8, which is lower than Fizeau's result (0.875). Therefore either way, these expressions differ.

But what is the actual physical answer? Well, when using the relativistic velocity addition formula in this context, I need to reconcile the notion that the speed of light is solely dependent on the medium's properties. But recall that, in a medium, the atoms might affect the propagation differently. The refractive index comes from the electromagnetic interactions, which are Lorentz covariant. Hmm. So the exact expression might be derived via relativistic transformations of the permittivity and permeability. Or alternatively, you have to take into account if the medium's motion changes the effective refractive index. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a distinction between phase velocity and group velocity, but the problem asks for the speed of light, which usually refers to the phase velocity perhaps, but not sure.

Given that the problem states, "speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory," this seems to be a straightforward velocity addition. However, if the speed of light inside the medium is u' = c/n in the glass's rest frame, then in the lab frame where the glass is moving at v, we need to use relativistic velocity addition.

But here's another thought: Since light always travels at speed c in vacuum in any inertial frame, but in a medium its speed is reduced, and if the medium is moving, perhaps we can model it as such.

Alternatively, suppose that in the lab frame, the glass is moving at speed v. Let the rest frame of the glass be S', moving at v relative to the lab frame S. In S', the speed of light is u' = c/n. So the question is, what is the speed u in S? Use relativistic velocity addition.

Variable speeds: u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). Since c=1, so u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v). Since u' = 1/n, we have u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n).

This would mean that the observed speed is depending on v and n through this formula. So first, we need to confirm that velocity addition applies here as such.

Therefore the answer is (v + 1/n)/(1 + (v/n)). Let me check units.

Given that c is set to 1, units are normalized. If v is given as, say, 0.5c, then v=0.5. The result (0.5 + 0.5) / (1 + 0.25) = 1/1.25 = 0.8. Alternatively, if v is small, e.g., 0.1, then approximately (0.1 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.05) ≈ 0.6 / 1.05 ≈ 0.571. However, Fizeau's formula would give 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²). For n=2 and v=0.1, that's 0.5 + 0.1*(1 - 0.25) = 0.5 + 0.075 = 0.575. Which would be similar to the approximation of the u expression.

Thus, perhaps the question's answer in introductory physics terms is Fizeau's formula u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²), but strictly speaking, relativistically, it's the velocity addition formula. However, the problem says "Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1"—so hold on: The setup says the light is propagating through glass with n, moving at velocity v in same direction as beam and lab observer. Since the problem mentions "speed of light in glass relative to the observer," I need to think: the speed at which light is moving through the glass, from the lab's perspective. But n is defined in the rest frame of the glass. So, perhaps employ the velocity addition formula.

But someone might argue that since light is moving inside the medium, which is itself moving, you have to consider that if the glass is moving at velocity v, the light is moving at velocity (c/n) in the glass's frame, leading to the lab frame speed being (c/n) plus v adjusted by relativistic addition. Which is the formula u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). So in terms of unit c=1, that would be the answer. Thus, is this formula correct?

Let me verify with some thought experiments. For instance, if the glass is moving at the speed of light in the medium. If n=1, then the medium is vacuum. If n=1 (although that's typically vacuum, but let's make n=1), then the formula gives (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) = (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1. So it reduces to c. Which makes sense, as n=1 implies vacuum, so light is moving at speed c in the lab.

Wait, but if I set n=2 (so the speed of light in the glass is 0.5) and v (the speed of glass) is 0.5. Then adding via velocity addition gives (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + (0.25)) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8, which is less than c=1, which is acceptable. Now, if we set v=1, we run into a problem. However, n is typically greater than 1, so in the case that in the medium rest frame, the light speed is less than 1, then the result would remain possible.

So it seems the formula (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) is a plausible answer, as derived from relativistic velocity addition. On the other hand, the Fizeau's formula is a non-relativistic approximation. Therefore, based on special relativity, the exact answer is (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n).

But (Answer) 
**Final Answer**
The speed of light in glass relative to the observer is \boxed{\dfrac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}}.

Alright, I need to determine the speed of light in glass as observed by someone in the laboratory, when the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The glass has a refractive index of n, and I'm using c=1 as the speed of light in vacuum.

Under normal circumstances, with stationary glass, light would travel at a speed of c/n, which equals 1/n in this case. However, since the glass is moving, I need to consider how velocities combine in this scenario. This likely requires velocity addition between the light's speed in the glass and the glass's motion relative to the laboratory frame.

There are two approaches to velocity addition: Galilean and Einsteinian. Since light involves high speeds, the relativistic approach is more appropriate. Under Galilean relativity, if light moves at u' = 1/n in the glass frame and the glass moves at velocity v in the lab frame, the observed speed would simply be u = u' + v. However, this simplistic addition doesn't apply at speeds comparable to c.

The correct relativistic velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²), which simplifies to (u' + v)/(1 + u' v) when c=1. Substituting u' = 1/n gives us (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) * v). This requires applying the Lorentz transformation to determine the light's speed in the laboratory frame.

Another perspective comes from Fizeau's experiment, which studied light propagation through moving media like flowing water. His results demonstrated that light's speed in a moving medium isn't simply the sum of the medium's velocity and light's speed in the stationary medium. Instead, he found the formula u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²).

It's worth noting that Fizeau's formula predated special relativity. Einstein later showed that Fizeau's result could be derived from relativistic velocity addition. While Fizeau's formula is an approximation for low velocities, the exact relativistic formula provides a more precise expression.

So we have two approaches: Fizeau's approximate formula u = (1/n) + v*(1 - 1/n²) (with c=1), and the full relativistic velocity addition formula.

Sure, here's the paraphrased text:

Alright, I need to determine the speed of light in a piece of glass as observed from the laboratory, given the glass is moving with a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light. The glass has a refractive index of n, and the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. Let me start by going over some fundamental concepts.

Normally, without the glass moving, the speed of light inside would be c divided by the refractive index, so it's 1/n. But since the glass is moving, we likely need to consider how the velocities add up between the light in the glass and the glass's movement relative to the lab frame. I recall there's Galilean and Einsteinian velocity addition. Since we're dealing with light, where high speeds are involved, we should probably use the relativistic velocity addition formula. However, I'm not completely certain. Let me think it through.

In the context of Galilean relativity, if the glass moves with velocity v and the light's speed in the glass's frame is u' = 1/n, then the lab frame speed would be u = u' + v. But with light, this is problematic because special relativity does not allow velocities to add up in a straightforward manner. Galilean addition is an approximation at low speeds, but with significant fractions of c, the correct relativistic formula is needed.

The relativistic velocity addition formula states that u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/c²). Given c=1, it simplifies to (u' + v)/(1 + u'v). Substituting u' = 1/n, it becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v). Nevertheless, in the glass's rest frame, the light speed is 1/n. Therefore, when the glass moves at speed v in the lab frame, the Lorentz transformation should be applied to determine the light's speed in the lab frame. I need to confirm if this is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a situation where the motion of the medium affects the effective speed of light. Fizeau's experiment comes to mind as it dealt with light speed in a moving medium, such as water flowing in a pipe. His results showed that light speed in a moving medium isn't just the sum of light speed in the medium and the medium's velocity. Instead, it involves a combination with the refractive index, like u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²), or something similar.

I need to verify this. According to Fizeau's experiment, when a medium with refractive index n moves with speed v in the direction of light, the observed light speed u is roughly u ≈ c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). However, this predates special relativity, and Einstein later demonstrated this results from relativistic velocity addition.

So, the precise relativistic formula provides a different expression, while Fizeau's formula is an approximation for low velocities. Let me revisit both methods.

First, using Fizeau's approach: If the medium travels at velocity v in the lab frame, the light speed in the lab frame is (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²), which translates to u = (1/n) + v(1 - 1/n²), considering c=1 here.

Alternatively, based on special relativity, the appropriate method involves the...

Suppose in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is u\' = 1/n. Then, the lab frame moves at velocity -v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame). Using velocity addition formula:\n\nu = (u\' + v) / (1 + u\' v)\n\nBut wait, velocity addition formula says that if frame S\' is moving at speed v relative to frame S, then the speed in S is (u\' + v)/(1 + u\' v /c²). Since c=1 here, denominator is 1 + u\' v.\n\nSo substituting u\' = 1/n, we get:\n\nu = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v) \n\nSo is this the correct formula? Let\'s see. Let me check units. Since c=1, all velocities are in units of c, so dimensionless. If v is in terms of c=1, this is okay.\n\nBut let\'s compare this to Fizeau\'s formula. Suppose n is large, and v is small. Then u ≈ (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n) ≈ 1/n + v - (1/n)(v/n) - v^2/n ≈ 1/n + v (1 - 1/n²), which is Fizeau\'s formula. So, for small v, the relativistic addition reduces to Fizeau\'s approximation. Therefore, the exact formula from SR is u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n). Hmm, but maybe the speed of light in the moving medium is not simply calculated by a direct velocity addition. \n\nWait, stepping back, maybe there\'s confusion here. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. So if the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, normally, according to Galilean transformations, the light speed would just be c/n + v. But relativistically, we need to use velocity addition. Since the glass is moving at v, to get the velocity of the light in the lab frame, use the velocity addition formula where u\' is c/n, the velocity in the glass\'s frame, and the frames are moving at v relative to each other. Therefore, using relativistic addition, the velocity in lab frame u is (u\' + v)/(1 + u\'v), so ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)v )\n\nBut in Fizeau\'s experiment, the measured speed was something like c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). So this suggests that either the addition formula applies differently, or there may be a consideration of the dragging of the medium? Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe in Fizeau\'s case, the medium\'s motion only partially drags the light, hence that term (1 - 1/n²). But if in the rest frame of the medium the speed is c/n, then in the lab frame, according to SR\'s velocity addition, it should be the formula (u\' + v)/(1 + u\'v), which when n is large (high refractive index, so c/n is small), and for small v, this approximates to (u\' + v) ≈ c/n + v. However, with the denominator included, the exact expression for u is more complicated, but when approximating for small v, we can Taylor expand:\n\nu = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n)v/c²). Wait, but if c=1, (c/n)v becomes (v/n). Hence, writing (1 + v/n)^(-1) ≈ 1 - v/n + (v/n)^2 - ... \n\nTherefore, u ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n) ≈ 1/n + v - v/n² - v²/n. If v is small, v²/n is negligible. So that would give u ≈ 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²), matching Fizeau\'s result. So that suggests that Fizeau\'s formula is an approximation to the exact relativistic velocity addition.\n\nHence, if we are to find the exact speed, regardless of how big v is, we should use the relativistic addition formula, but since the problem doesn\'t specify that v is small, maybe that\'s the way to go. However, the problem states that the glass is moving at constant velocity v, but doesn\'t specify whether we need to use relativistic or classical velocity addition. \n\nBut since it\'s a problem in physics, and without any mention of non-relativistic, maybe the answer expects the relativistic velocity addition. However, in many textbooks, when considering the speed of light in a moving medium, they derive the formula using relativistic addition. \n\nAlternatively, some sources might differentiate between the phase velocity and the group velocity, but in the problem, it\'s just the speed of light. If the light is propagating in a moving medium, then the speed of light in the medium will depend on the motion of the medium. According to Special Relativity, one needs to apply velocity addition. So, let\'s proceed accordingly.\n\nSo, in the glass\'s rest frame, the speed of light is u\' = c/n = 1/n. The lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass (since in the lab frame, the glass is moving at +v). Using relativistic velocity addition: speed in lab frame u is (u\' + v)/(1 + u\'v/c²). Since here c=1, this simplifies to (u\' + v)/(1 + u\'v) = (1/n + v) / (1 + (v/n)). \n\nAlternatively, some sources discuss using the Lorentz transformation for velocities. If the light has velocity u\' in the glass frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, then:\n\nu = (u\' + v) / (1 + u\'v)\n\nThis gives (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). So that would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s check with an example. Suppose n=1, which is vacuum. Then, the speed of light should be c=1 regardless of the frame. Substituting n=1 into the formula: (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct.\n\nIf the glass is stationary, v=0. Then, the speed is 1/n, which is correct. If v approaches c=1, then suppose n=2, v=0.5. Then u=(0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1/1.25 = 0.8. Which is less than c, as expected. If the glass were moving at v=0.9, n=2. Then speed would be (0.5 + 0.9)/(1 + 0.45) = 1.4/1.45 ≈0.9655, which is still less than c. So even at high velocities, it doesn\'t exceed c. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the glass were moving opposite to the light, say v is negative. But in the problem, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam toward the observer.\n\nHence, assuming that velocity v is directed along the light\'s direction, i.e., in the same direction as the light is moving in the lab frame. Therefore, using the velocity addition formula (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) gives a valid speed. So this seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check literature to confirm. Searching for "speed of light in moving medium special relativity", quickly... \n\nAccording to some sources (e.g., Wikipedia: Fresnel\'s drag coefficient), the phase velocity of light in a moving medium is given by v_phase = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). But that\'s the Fresnel drag coefficient, which Fizeau measured. However, as per special relativity, when you use the relativistic velocity addition formula, the resultant speed is indeed (c/n + v)/(1 + (v)/(n c)). Since c=1 here, that simplifies to exactly the same formula above, so (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). Wait, but how does this relate to Fresnel\'s formula?\n\nBecause for small velocities v << c, (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n + ...) ≈1/n + v - v/n², which is exactly Fresnel\'s formula: (1/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). So, yes, as the velocity of the medium becomes significant, the exact formula deviates from Fresnel\'s, but at low speeds, they agree.\n\nHence, depending on the problem\'s intention, which says that the glass is moving at constant velocity v, and it\'s about the speed of light measured by the lab observer, we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition. So the answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). Simplify this expression if possible. Multiply numerator and denominator by n:\n\n(1 + n v) / (n + v). So, u = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Since c=1, and all velocities are relative to c, this is the final result. Check with n=1 scenario, as before. Then u=(1 + v)/(1 + v)=1. Correct. If v=0, u=1/n. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the moving glass according to the lab observer is (1 + n v)/(n + v).\n\nAlternatively, (n^{-1} + v) / (1 + v n^{-1}) can also be written as [v + (1/n)] / [1 + (v/n)], which is equivalent. Both forms are correct, but perhaps factored as (1 + n v)/(n + v) is neater. But maybe expressing in terms of c. Wait, since the speed of light in the glass is reduced by the factor n, when the medium is moving, combining the velocities appropriately gives (u\' + v)/(1 + u\' v) where u\'=1/n. So in terms of formula, the answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n).\n\nAlternatively, some sources just say that the velocity is (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)), which simplifies in units where c=1 to (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). So maybe writing it in terms of c: u = (c/n + v)/(1 + (v c)/n c²) = (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)), but with c=1, it becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). \n\nTherefore, after all that, the answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is the same as ((1/n) + v)/(1 + v/n). Perfect. So that\'s the derivation. Let me double-check with another example. Take n=2, v=0.5. Then u=(1 + 1)/(2 + 0.5)=2/2.5=0.8. If calculated as (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25)=1/1.25=0.8, same result. Correct. \n\nTherefore, formula seems consistent. Hence, the answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v). But the problem mentions the glass is moving toward the observer in the lab. Wait, the problem says, "the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory."\n\nWait, the light is propagating through the glass, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam (so same direction as the light), towards the observer. Wait, direction is a bit of concern here. If the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, then if we consider velocities in the lab frame, v is in the direction of light propagation. But applying the same formula is okay. \n\nWait, let\'s reorient. If in the lab frame, the light is moving to the right, the glass is also moving to the right at speed v. So from the glass\'s perspective, the lab is moving to the left at speed v, and the light in the glass is moving to the right at speed u\' =1/n. Transforming back to lab frame, velocity of light: (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v). Which gives the same answer as before. So direction matters only in the sign of velocity. But since both are moving in same direction, velocity is positive. \n\nSo the answer is as derived. Hence, (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let me check if that\'s the case. Yes.\n\nSo, writing the final answer as that. Given that c=1, no need to involve additional units.

To determine the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in the laboratory when the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

1. **Speed of Light in Glass Rest Frame**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( \frac{1}{n} \) (since the refractive index \( n \) reduces the speed of light from \( c = 1 \) in vacuum).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: When transforming the velocity from the glass's rest frame to the laboratory frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

3. **Substitute Values**: Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula gives:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \left(\frac{1}{n}\right) v}
   \]

4. **Simplify Expression**: Simplifying the numerator and the denominator by multiplying both by \( n \):
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 velocity addition formula. Suppose in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is u' = 1/n. Then, the lab frame moves at velocity -v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame). Using velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v)

But wait, velocity addition formula says that if frame S' is moving at speed v relative to frame S, then the speed in S is (u' + v)/(1 + u' v /c²). Since c=1 here, denominator is 1 + u' v.

So substituting u' = 1/n, we get:

u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v) 

So is this the correct formula? Let's see. Let me check units. Since c=1, all velocities are in units of c, so dimensionless. If v is in terms of c=1, this is okay.

But let's compare this to Fizeau's formula. Suppose n is large, and v is small. Then u ≈ (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n) ≈ 1/n + v - (1/n)(v/n) - v^2/n ≈ 1/n + v (1 - 1/n²), which is Fizeau's formula. So, for small v, the relativistic addition reduces to Fizeau's approximation. Therefore, the exact formula from SR is u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/n). Hmm, but maybe the speed of light in the moving medium is not simply calculated by a direct velocity addition. 

Wait, stepping back, maybe there's confusion here. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. So if the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, normally, according to Galilean transformations, the light speed would just be c/n + v. But relativistically, we need to use velocity addition. Since the glass is moving at v, to get the velocity of the light in the lab frame, use the velocity addition formula where u' is c/n, the velocity in the glass's frame, and the frames are moving at v relative to each other. Therefore, using relativistic addition, the velocity in lab frame u is (u' + v)/(1 + u'v), so ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)v )

But in Fizeau's experiment, the measured speed was something like c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). So this suggests that either the addition formula applies differently, or there may be a consideration of the dragging of the medium? Hmm. 

Wait, maybe in Fizeau's case, the medium's motion only partially drags the light, hence that term (1 - 1/n²). But if in the rest frame of the medium the speed is c/n, then in the lab frame, according to SR's velocity addition, it should be the formula (u' + v)/(1 + u'v), which when n is large (high refractive index, so c/n is small), and for small v, this approximates to (u' + v) ≈ c/n + v. However, with the denominator included, the exact expression for u is more complicated, but when approximating for small v, we can Taylor expand:

u = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n)v/c²). Wait, but if c=1, (c/n)v becomes (v/n). Hence, writing (1 + v/n)^(-1) ≈ 1 - v/n + (v/n)^2 - ... 

Therefore, u ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n) ≈ 1/n + v - v/n² - v²/n. If v is small, v²/n is negligible. So that would give u ≈ 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²), matching Fizeau's result. So that suggests that Fizeau's formula is an approximation to the exact relativistic velocity addition.

Hence, if we are to find the exact speed, regardless of how big v is, we should use the relativistic addition formula, but since the problem doesn't specify that v is small, maybe that's the way to go. However, the problem states that the glass is moving at constant velocity v, but doesn't specify whether we need to use relativistic or classical velocity addition. 

But since it's a problem in physics, and without any mention of non-relativistic, maybe the answer expects the relativistic velocity addition. However, in many textbooks, when considering the speed of light in a moving medium, they derive the formula using relativistic addition. 

Alternatively, some sources might differentiate between the phase velocity and the group velocity, but in the problem, it's just the speed of light. If the light is propagating in a moving medium, then the speed of light in the medium will depend on the motion of the medium. According to Special Relativity, one needs to apply velocity addition. So, let's proceed accordingly.

So, in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is u' = c/n = 1/n. The lab frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass (since in the lab frame, the glass is moving at +v). Using relativistic velocity addition: speed in lab frame u is (u' + v)/(1 + u'v/c²). Since here c=1, this simplifies to (u' + v)/(1 + u'v) = (1/n + v) / (1 + (v/n)). 

Alternatively, some sources discuss using the Lorentz transformation for velocities. If the light has velocity u' in the glass frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, then:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v)

This gives (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, let's check with an example. Suppose n=1, which is vacuum. Then, the speed of light should be c=1 regardless of the frame. Substituting n=1 into the formula: (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct.

If the glass is stationary, v=0. Then, the speed is 1/n, which is correct. If v approaches c=1, then suppose n=2, v=0.5. Then u=(0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25) = 1/1.25 = 0.8. Which is less than c, as expected. If the glass were moving at v=0.9, n=2. Then speed would be (0.5 + 0.9)/(1 + 0.45) = 1.4/1.45 ≈0.9655, which is still less than c. So even at high velocities, it doesn't exceed c. That makes sense.

Alternatively, if the glass were moving opposite to the light, say v is negative. But in the problem, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam toward the observer.

Hence, assuming that velocity v is directed along the light's direction, i.e., in the same direction as the light is moving in the lab frame. Therefore, using the velocity addition formula (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) gives a valid speed. So this seems to be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check literature to confirm. Searching for "speed of light in moving medium special relativity", quickly... 

According to some sources (e.g., Wikipedia: Fresnel's drag coefficient), the phase velocity of light in a moving medium is given by v_phase = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). But that's the Fresnel drag coefficient, which Fizeau measured. However, as per special relativity, when you use the relativistic velocity addition formula, the resultant speed is indeed (c/n + v)/(1 + (v)/(n c)). Since c=1 here, that simplifies to exactly the same formula above, so (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). Wait, but how does this relate to Fresnel's formula?

Because for small velocities v << c, (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n) ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - v/n + ...) ≈1/n + v - v/n², which is exactly Fresnel's formula: (1/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). So, yes, as the velocity of the medium becomes significant, the exact formula deviates from Fresnel's, but at low speeds, they agree.

Hence, depending on the problem's intention, which says that the glass is moving at constant velocity v, and it's about the speed of light measured by the lab observer, we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition. So the answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). Simplify this expression if possible. Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

(1 + n v) / (n + v). So, u = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Since c=1, and all velocities are relative to c, this is the final result. Check with n=1 scenario, as before. Then u=(1 + v)/(1 + v)=1. Correct. If v=0, u=1/n. Correct. 

Therefore, the speed of light in the moving glass according to the lab observer is (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Alternatively, (n^{-1} + v) / (1 + v n^{-1}) can also be written as [v + (1/n)] / [1 + (v/n)], which is equivalent. Both forms are correct, but perhaps factored as (1 + n v)/(n + v) is neater. But maybe expressing in terms of c. Wait, since the speed of light in the glass is reduced by the factor n, when the medium is moving, combining the velocities appropriately gives (u' + v)/(1 + u' v) where u'=1/n. So in terms of formula, the answer is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n).

Alternatively, some sources just say that the velocity is (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)), which simplifies in units where c=1 to (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). So maybe writing it in terms of c: u = (c/n + v)/(1 + (v c)/n c²) = (c/n + v)/(1 + v/(n c)), but with c=1, it becomes (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). 

Therefore, after all that, the answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is the same as ((1/n) + v)/(1 + v/n). Perfect. So that's the derivation. Let me double-check with another example. Take n=2, v=0.5. Then u=(1 + 1)/(2 + 0.5)=2/2.5=0.8. If calculated as (0.5 + 0.5)/(1 + 0.25)=1/1.25=0.8, same result. Correct. 

Therefore, formula seems consistent. Hence, the answer is (1 + n v)/(n + v). But the problem mentions the glass is moving toward the observer in the lab. Wait, the problem says, "the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory."

Wait, the light is propagating through the glass, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam (so same direction as the light), towards the observer. Wait, direction is a bit of concern here. If the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, then if we consider velocities in the lab frame, v is in the direction of light propagation. But applying the same formula is okay. 

Wait, let's reorient. If in the lab frame, the light is moving to the right, the glass is also moving to the right at speed v. So from the glass's perspective, the lab is moving to the left at speed v, and the light in the glass is moving to the right at speed u' =1/n. Transforming back to lab frame, velocity of light: (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v). Which gives the same answer as before. So direction matters only in the sign of velocity. But since both are moving in same direction, velocity is positive. 

So the answer is as derived. Hence, (1 + n v)/(n + v). Let me check if that's the case. Yes.

So, writing the final answer as that. Given that c=1, no need to involve additional units. Hence, \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

**Final Answer**
The speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

Let\'s try plugging into the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let the velocity of light in the glass medium\'s rest frame be u\' = c/n = 1/n. Then the lab frame, observed speed u is given by (u\' + v)/(1 + u\'v). Since c=1, substituting gives u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).\n\nIf the glass is moving at v and within it, light moves at 1/n relative to the glass, then the lab frame speed is the relativistic sum of v and 1/n.\n\nBut Fizeau\'s formula was for light moving in a moving medium. In his experiment, when the medium was moving with speed v, the speed of light was observed as u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). So perhaps similar expression here... except that depends on dragging of the aether, but special relativity gives a derivation for that effect.\n\nWait, so if we compare... With Fizeau\'s formula in the lab frame, if the medium is moving at velocity v, then the speed of light is computed as:\n\nu = (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). Since in this problem, c is 1, so u = (1/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). However, according to relativity, via the velocity addition formula, we have u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).\n\nNow the question arises: which is correct? Fizeau\'s formula or the relativistic velocity addition? Wait, but Fizeau\'s formula is actually derivable from the relativistic velocity addition. Let me check. Let me perform a Taylor expansion of the velocity addition formula. Let\'s assume v is much smaller than c, which in our units c=1 so v≪1.\n\nSo u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).\n\nExpand this in a Taylor series for small v:\n\nu ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - (v/n) + (v²/n²) - ...)  using 1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - ... for small x.\n\nMultiplying out:\n\n(1/n)(1 - v/n) + v(1 - v/n) ≈ (1/n - v/n²) + (v - v²/n)\n\nExpand up to first order in v:\n\n1/n + v(1 - 1/n²) - (v²/n²) + v² terms.\n\nBut if we neglect terms of order v², we have u ≈ (1/n) + v(1 - 1/n²), which is exactly Fizeau\'s result. Therefore, for small velocities (v ≪ c), Fizeau\'s formula is a good approximation.\n\nHowever, the exact formula given by the relativistic velocity addition is u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). This is more accurate at any speed.\n\nBut wait, isn\'t the invariance of the speed of light maintained here? If the glass approached the speed of light, but the light is already supposed to go at speed c.\n\nWait, but in the medium, light moves at 1/n. So, if the glass is moving at velocity v, transforming velocities, theoretically the composition is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n).\n\nSo even if v approaches 1, then u approaches (1/n + 1)/(1 + 1/n) = (1 + n)/n / ( (n +1)/n ) = 1. Therefore, the speed of light in the lab frame still doesn\'t exceed 1, which is consistent with special relativity.\n\nHence, the exact speed according to relativity is (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). So unless there\'s additional complications.\n\nBut hold on, when you have a moving medium, is the velocity of the light in the medium treated as if the medium\'s rest frame has refractive index n, so u\' = c/n, which then transforms according to standard relativistic velocity addition?\n\nAlternatively, sometimes moving dielectrics have other factors. For instance, the speed of light in a moving medium can depend additionally on the direction of motion and the polarization. However, here the question states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. And we treat it with velocity addition.\n\nIn some materials, moving at a velocity introduces effects like dragging, which Fizeau\'s experiment demonstrated, but according to the derivations in special relativity, you can use velocity addition with the velocity of the frame (the glass), but let me confirm.\n\nWait, velocity addition in special relativity applies to velocity between two frames. The observer in the lab frame sees the glass moving at v. In the glass\'s rest frame, light moves at u\' = 1/n. Then Lorentz transformation of velocities gives u = (u\' + v)/(1 + u\'v).\n\nTherefore, the correct exact velocity is (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). Therefore, if v were small, this is approximately 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²), which matches Fizeau\'s equation. However, if the exact answer is required, even for arbitrary v, then the first formula is correct.\n\nHence, since the problem states the glass is moving at any constant velocity v (not sure if non-relativistic), the correct answer is better given by the relativistic expression (1/n + v) / (1 + (v/n)).\n\nBut here c=1, which is taken. So unit analysis: both numerator and denominator are velocities over dimensionless terms. So the formula is ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + v/n ).\n\nAlternatively, writing that as [v + (1/n)] / [1 + (v/n)].\n\nAlternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator by n to get [v n + 1]/[n + v].\n\nThus, (1 + n v)/(n + v). Wait:\n\nWait, start with (1/n + v) / (1 + (v/n)).\n\nMultiply numerator by n: 1 + n v.\n\nDenominator by n: n + v.\n\nHence, the expression is equal to (1 + n v)/(n + v).\n\nHmm, is that correct?\n\nWait, let\'s check:\n\n(1/n + v) / (1 + v/n) = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = ( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Yes, correct.\n\nSo, (1 + n v)/(n + v).\n\nAlternatively, that\'s how you write the answer. For example, if n=1 (vacuum), speed is (1 + v)/(1 + v)=1. Which makes sense. If glass is act like vacuum, n=1, hence speed is 1. If the glass is stationary (v=0), speed is (1 + 0)/(n + 0) = 1/n. Which is correct.\n\nTherefore, under all checks, the correct formula is (1 + n v)/(n + v).\n\nHence, perhaps that\'s the answer.\n\nWait the problem states "the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory." Therefore, the beam and the glass move in the same direction (toward the observer), so the lab frame is watching light propagating in the same direction as the motion of the glass.\n\nTherefore, clarifies direction.\n\nUse the velocity addition formula. So light speed in glass\'s frame is u\' = c/n. Then in lab frame, u = (u\' + v)/(1 + u\' v) where since velocities are sequential directions, moving oppositely?\n\nWait no. The frame S\' is moving at velocity +v relative to the lab frame S, such that the glass is moving at velocity v in the S frame (lab). The light in the S\' frame (glass rest frame) is moving at u\' = c/n = 1/n. According to the velocity addition formula, u = (u\' + v)/(1 + u\' v). Which is then (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n )).\n\nThus, the same as previously, leading to (1 + n v)/(n +v). So the formula (1/n + v )/(1 + v/n ) equals (1 + n v)/(n + v ). So that\'s the correct answer. Therefore, the speed of light in the lab frame is (1/n + v ) divided by (1 + (v/n )) which simplifies to (1 + n v )/(n + v ).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s another consideration.\n\nWait, some sources suggest that the Fresnel drag coefficient. But indeed, in Fizeau\'s experiment, the formula corresponding to what I just found as the first-order term.\n\nBut since the problem doesn\'t specify non-relativistic speeds, the exact answer should be the relativistic velocity addition result. Therefore, box that.\n\nAlternatively, but wait, velocity addition for moving medium. Not sure. In some models, when the medium is moving parallel to the light\'s direction, you use a different formula. Wait: Wait, the speed of light in a medium with refractive index n is c/n when the medium is at rest. If the medium is moving, treat the speed using Einstein\'s velocity addition. So, since in the medium rest frame, light goes at u\' = c/n, and the frame is moving at speed v, the lab frame speed u = (u\' + v)/(1 + u\' v / c² ).

Therefore, even if the glass move at speed of light, the observed light speed is 1, which is correct. If n approaches infinity (totally opaque), then speed of light in medium tends to 0, then observed velocity would be (0 + v)/(1 + 0 ) = v, which makes sense. Wait, but n is the refractive index.

To determine the speed of light in glass relative to an observer in the laboratory when the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

1. **Refractive Index and Light Speed in Stationary Medium**:
   - The speed of light in a stationary glass (with refractive index \( n \)) is \( \frac{c}{n} \). Here, \( c = 1 \), so it is \( \frac{1}{n} \).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:
   - When the glass moves at velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
     \[
     u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
     \]
   - Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \):
     \[
     u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \left( \frac{1}{n} \right) v}
     \]

3. **Simplifying the Expression**:
   - Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:
     \[
     u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
     \]

4. **Checks and Consistency**:
   - If the glass is stationary (\( v = 0 \)), the speed is \( \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct.
   - If the glass moves at the speed of light (\( v = 1 \)), the speed approaches \( 1 \), consistent with special relativity.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 But which is the correct approach here?

Wait, perhaps they are connected. Let's try plugging into the relativistic velocity addition formula. Let the velocity of light in the glass medium's rest frame be u' = c/n = 1/n. Then the lab frame, observed speed u is given by (u' + v)/(1 + u'v). Since c=1, substituting gives u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).

If the glass is moving at v and within it, light moves at 1/n relative to the glass, then the lab frame speed is the relativistic sum of v and 1/n.

But Fizeau's formula was for light moving in a moving medium. In his experiment, when the medium was moving with speed v, the speed of light was observed as u = c/n + v(1 - 1/n²). So perhaps similar expression here... except that depends on dragging of the aether, but special relativity gives a derivation for that effect.

Wait, so if we compare... With Fizeau's formula in the lab frame, if the medium is moving at velocity v, then the speed of light is computed as:

u = (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). Since in this problem, c is 1, so u = (1/n) + v(1 - 1/n²). However, according to relativity, via the velocity addition formula, we have u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).

Now the question arises: which is correct? Fizeau's formula or the relativistic velocity addition? Wait, but Fizeau's formula is actually derivable from the relativistic velocity addition. Let me check. Let me perform a Taylor expansion of the velocity addition formula. Let's assume v is much smaller than c, which in our units c=1 so v≪1.

So u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).

Expand this in a Taylor series for small v:

u ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - (v/n) + (v²/n²) - ...)  using 1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - ... for small x.

Multiplying out:

(1/n)(1 - v/n) + v(1 - v/n) ≈ (1/n - v/n²) + (v - v²/n)

Expand up to first order in v:

1/n + v(1 - 1/n²) - (v²/n²) + v² terms.

But if we neglect terms of order v², we have u ≈ (1/n) + v(1 - 1/n²), which is exactly Fizeau's result. Therefore, for small velocities (v ≪ c), Fizeau's formula is a good approximation.

However, the exact formula given by the relativistic velocity addition is u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). This is more accurate at any speed.

But wait, isn't the invariance of the speed of light maintained here? If the glass approached the speed of light, but the light is already supposed to go at speed c.

Wait, but in the medium, light moves at 1/n. So, if the glass is moving at velocity v, transforming velocities, theoretically the composition is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n).

So even if v approaches 1, then u approaches (1/n + 1)/(1 + 1/n) = (1 + n)/n / ( (n +1)/n ) = 1. Therefore, the speed of light in the lab frame still doesn't exceed 1, which is consistent with special relativity.

Hence, the exact speed according to relativity is (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). So unless there's additional complications.

But hold on, when you have a moving medium, is the velocity of the light in the medium treated as if the medium's rest frame has refractive index n, so u' = c/n, which then transforms according to standard relativistic velocity addition?

Alternatively, sometimes moving dielectrics have other factors. For instance, the speed of light in a moving medium can depend additionally on the direction of motion and the polarization. However, here the question states the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. And we treat it with velocity addition.

In some materials, moving at a velocity introduces effects like dragging, which Fizeau's experiment demonstrated, but according to the derivations in special relativity, you can use velocity addition with the velocity of the frame (the glass), but let me confirm.

Wait, velocity addition in special relativity applies to velocity between two frames. The observer in the lab frame sees the glass moving at v. In the glass's rest frame, light moves at u' = 1/n. Then Lorentz transformation of velocities gives u = (u' + v)/(1 + u'v).

Therefore, the correct exact velocity is (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)). Therefore, if v were small, this is approximately 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²), which matches Fizeau's equation. However, if the exact answer is required, even for arbitrary v, then the first formula is correct.

Hence, since the problem states the glass is moving at any constant velocity v (not sure if non-relativistic), the correct answer is better given by the relativistic expression (1/n + v) / (1 + (v/n)).

But here c=1, which is taken. So unit analysis: both numerator and denominator are velocities over dimensionless terms. So the formula is ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + v/n ).

Alternatively, writing that as [v + (1/n)] / [1 + (v/n)].

Alternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator by n to get [v n + 1]/[n + v].

Thus, (1 + n v)/(n + v). Wait:

Wait, start with (1/n + v) / (1 + (v/n)).

Multiply numerator by n: 1 + n v.

Denominator by n: n + v.

Hence, the expression is equal to (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Hmm, is that correct?

Wait, let's check:

(1/n + v) / (1 + v/n) = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = ( (1 + n v)/n ) / ( (n + v)/n ) ) = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Yes, correct.

So, (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Alternatively, that's how you write the answer. For example, if n=1 (vacuum), speed is (1 + v)/(1 + v)=1. Which makes sense. If glass is act like vacuum, n=1, hence speed is 1. If the glass is stationary (v=0), speed is (1 + 0)/(n + 0) = 1/n. Which is correct.

Therefore, under all checks, the correct formula is (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Hence, perhaps that's the answer.

Wait the problem states "the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory." Therefore, the beam and the glass move in the same direction (toward the observer), so the lab frame is watching light propagating in the same direction as the motion of the glass.

Therefore, clarifies direction.

Use the velocity addition formula. So light speed in glass's frame is u' = c/n. Then in lab frame, u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v) where since velocities are sequential directions, moving oppositely?

Wait no. The frame S' is moving at velocity +v relative to the lab frame S, such that the glass is moving at velocity v in the S frame (lab). The light in the S' frame (glass rest frame) is moving at u' = c/n = 1/n. According to the velocity addition formula, u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v). Which is then (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n )).

Thus, the same as previously, leading to (1 + n v)/(n +v). So the formula (1/n + v )/(1 + v/n ) equals (1 + n v)/(n + v ). So that's the correct answer. Therefore, the speed of light in the lab frame is (1/n + v ) divided by (1 + (v/n )) which simplifies to (1 + n v )/(n + v ).

Alternatively, perhaps there's another consideration.

Wait, some sources suggest that the Fresnel drag coefficient. But indeed, in Fizeau's experiment, the formula corresponding to what I just found as the first-order term.

But since the problem doesn't specify non-relativistic speeds, the exact answer should be the relativistic velocity addition result. Therefore, box that.

Alternatively, but wait, velocity addition for moving medium. Not sure. In some models, when the medium is moving parallel to the light's direction, you use a different formula. Wait: Wait, the speed of light in a medium with refractive index n is c/n when the medium is at rest. If the medium is moving, treat the speed using Einstein's velocity addition. So, since in the medium rest frame, light goes at u' = c/n, and the frame is moving at speed v, the lab frame speed u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v / c² ). Here c=1, so u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n )).

That's clearly the case. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

But let me check for edge cases. If the observer moves with the glass (i.e., v=0), then the speed is (1 +0)/(n +0 )=1/n, as expected. If the glass moves at v=1 (speed of light), then (1 +n*1)/(n +1)= (1 +n)/(n+1)=1. Therefore, even if the glass move at speed of light, the observed light speed is 1, which is correct. If n approaches infinity (totally opaque), then speed of light in medium tends to 0, then observed velocity would be (0 + v)/(1 + 0 ) = v, which makes sense. Wait, but n is the refractive index. If n is infinite, the speed in the medium is zero (refractive index is inversely proportional to speed). Then light is stuck in the medium. So if medium is moving at v, the observer would see them moving at v, which fits the formula.

Similarly, check when medium moves opposite to the light. If velocity is opposite (negative v), suppose medium moves in the opposite direction. Then speed becomes (1/n - |v|)/(1 - |v|/n ). In such cases, velocities can't exceed c. Here, of course, v is in the same direction as light, so moving towards the observer.

Another check: for small n v term, almost (1 + n v)/(n + v) ≈ [1/n](1 + n v)/(1 + v/n ) which by back an expansion? Not critical.

So final formula:

Observed speed u = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Assuming all symbols in their respective units, with c=1.

Therefore, the \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}} is the correct answer.


**Final Answer**
The speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \boxed{\dfrac{1 + n v}{n + v}}.

Suppose in the rest frame of the glass, light is moving at speed u\' = c/n. Then, the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame. So, how do we transform the light\'s velocity from the glass frame (S\') to the lab frame (S)?\n\nThe formula would be u = (u\' + v)/(1 + (u\'v)/c²). Since c=1, u = ( (1/n) + v )/(1 + (1/n) v ). If n is the refractive index, then 1/n is the light speed in the medium\'s rest frame. So substituting into this, the lab frame speed is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). Let me calculate it as:\n\nu = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n )\n\nAlternatively, factoring out 1/n in the numerator and the denominator...\n\nBut for small v, this is:\n\nUsing approximation (v + (1/n))/(1 + v/n) = 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²) + O(v²), which matches Fizeau\'s result. So, for low v, it\'s approximately Fizeau\'s term, but the rigorous formula is u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).\n\nHere, the problem states the glass (medium) is moving at velocity v towards the observer. But wait! The light beam is propagating through the glass, and both glass and light are moving in the same direction, towards the observer. Wait, no: if the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam. Wait, the beam direction: in the glass, isn\'t the beam moving through the glass? But that\'s internal. So the observer is in the lab frame. The glass is moving at speed v in the same direction as the beam, moving towards the observer.\n\nWait, am I correctly interpreting the direction? If the glass is moving towards the observer and the light beam is moving through the glass towards the observer. So the motion of the glass is in the same direction as the beam. Therefore, in the lab frame, the light inside the moving glass will have a speed that\'s combination of the glass\'s own velocity and the velocity of light in the glass\'s rest frame.\n\nBut let me take frame S as the laboratory frame, and frame S’ as the glass’s rest frame moving at velocity v relative to S. In S’, the light is moving at speed u’ = c/n. We need to transform this velocity back to frame S. The light is moving in the same direction as the frame S’ is moving relative to S (assuming the glass\'s motion direction is same as the light direction). Then, using the velocity addition formula.\n\nu = (u’ + v)/(1 + (u’ v)/c²) )\n\nSince u’ is positive (if direction is same as v), and u and v are in same direction.\n\nBut again, when v is motion velocity, if S’ is moving at v with respect to S. The direction then might need coordinate systems.\n\nCoordinate systems: Let’s straighten this out. Let\'s have lab frame S where observer is. Frame S’ is moving at velocity v in the +x direction (towards the observer) with respect to S. In frame S’, the light is moving in the +x direction (since same as glass\'s movement toward observer). The speed of light in frame S’ is u’ = c/n. Therefore, we apply the velocity addition formula to get u in lab frame S. Since S’ moves at velocity v, in S, the velocity would be (u’ + v)/(1 + (u’ v)/c² ). Since c=1, we have u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v).\n\nSimplifying the formula:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by n to remove the fraction:\n\nu = (1 + n v)/(n + v )\n\nAlternatively, keep as is: u = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n )\n\nThat seems to agree with previous thoughts.\n\nAlternatively, in some resources, when the medium is moving at speed v, the light speed in lab frame follows that formula.\n\nNow, considering if the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light\'s motion, then light\'s speed should be increased by some factor due to medium\'s movement. Conversely, if the medium moves opposite to the light\'s direction, it would decrease.\n\nAlternatively, in a medium at rest, the speed is 1/n. If the medium moves, it\'s not additive because of relativity.\n\nIn Fizeau\'s experiment, moving water with velocity v, dragged the light along with a fraction of v depending on the water\'s refractive index. The formula obtained was:\n\nu = (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²), approximately.\n\nBut according to relativistic addition, if we take u = (1/n +v )/(1 + (1/n)v ), expand this for small v (so applying Taylor expansion):\n\nu ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - (v/n) + ... ) ≈1/n + v - (v/n² ) - (v²)/n + ... So for small v, if we ignore quadratic terms, u ≈1/n + v(1 - 1/n² ). Exactly like Fizeau\'s result. Hence for nonlinearizing relativistic effect, fit that formula. Thus the relativistic formula within the same direction speed ratio would explain Fizeau\'s result.\n\nHowever, in our problem, we might just need directly use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Since the only information given is that glass is moving at v and in the same direction as light.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps hasty observers may conclude u = 1/n + v. But that can’t be right since speed can’t exceed c=1. So if n=1.5, and u would be 2/3 +v. If, for example, v is 0.5, u= 2/3 +1/2 =7/6, which exceeds c. Not allowed. So velocity addition formula must prevent that, which the relativistic formula does. Let\'s check:\n\nIf u = ( (1/n) +v )/(1 + ( v/n )). So for n=1.5, v=0.5:\n\nu=(2/3 +1/2)/(1 + (1/2)(2/3))= (4/6 +3/6)/(1 + 1/3)= (7/6)/(4/3)= (7/6)*(3/4 )=7/8 ≈0.875 <1, which is ok.\n\nBut via Galilean: 2/3 +1/2 ≈1.166 which bad.\n\nTherefore, it must be (u’ +v)/(1 + u’ v) with u’=1/n. So the correct formula replaces the naive addition with this.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider c to be 1, so frame S is lab, glass moves at speed v (direction towards observer), so if in the glass rest frame light speed is u\'=1/n. Then the lab speed would be u = (u’ +v)/(1 + u’ v ) = (1/n +v)/(1 + (v/n )).\n\nAlternatively, derived as follows:\n\nIn S’: x’ = (x - v t)/sqrt(1 - v² )\n\nt’ = (t - v x)/sqrt(1 - v² )\n\nWait, Lorentz transformation, but if speed is entering in derivation.\n\nWait, the standard Lorentz transformations for velocity. As it\'s a bit involved.\n\nActually,the velocity transformation law in special relativity is derived from the Lorentz transformation.\n\nIf in Frame S’ moving at speed v relative to S in +x direction, then velocities transform as:\n\nu = [u’ + v]/[1 + (u’ v)/c²]\n\nSo plugging u’=1/n (since speed in the medium is c/n), therefore:\n\nu = (1/n +v)/(1 + (v/n ))>>\n\nYes, assuming c=1.\n\nAdjusting units where c=1 seems simpler. Then repeating but for 1/n. So this formula indeed gives the observed speed in the lab frame.\n\nThus, if the velocity v that the glass is moving in lab frame is in the same direction as the light\'s propagation, then the speed of the light as observed in the lab should be (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n ).\n\nTherefore, the answer would be \\boxed{\\dfrac{v + \\dfrac{1}{n}}{1 + \\dfrac{v}{n}}}.\n\nBut let me cross-check sources. In Einstein\'s original paper maybe or a textbook.\n\nFor example, Feynman lectures or another reference. Alternatively, consult hyperphysics.\n\nUpon recalling, HyperPhysics has a page on moving media: According to it — light in a moving medium. For a medium with refractive index n moving at speed v, the speed of light observed is (c/n +v)/(1 + (v)/(n c))). So if c=1, this is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n ). So aligned with our previous result.\n\nCheck: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/relcon.html#c4\n\nThe formula given here for light moving in a moving medium towards the observer in the lab frame is (c/n + v)/(1 + (v)/(n c))).\n\nYes, so plugging c=1 gives our result.\n\nTherefore, it is confirmed, the standard relativistic addition gives the expression.\n\nHence, the answer is indeed (v + 1/n )/(1 + v/n )\n\nBut wait, an important check. If media’s speed v =0, the speed should reduce to 1/n. Let\'s check. Substitute v=0, getu=1/n. That checks. If media speed v approaches c, with v approaching 1 (since c=1), what is u?\n\nSuppose v approaches 1. Then expression becomes (1/n +1)/(1 +1 /n ) = [ (1 + n)/n ] / [ (n +1)/n ]=1. So even if media moves at speed 1 (c), the light can\'t go faster than c, so superposition gives limit c. That\'s correct.\n\nAnother test: if n=1 (medium is vacuum), then speed is (v+1 )/(1 +v )=1. Obviously, because in this degenerate case, the refractive medium is vacuum, which is same as lab frame. So light must move at speed 1. All right.\n\nComparing to Fizeau\'s experiment description: refracted light in moving water. The Fizeau formula is:\n\nu ≈ c/n + (1 -1/n²)v, which since Fizeau is valid when v is small. To check, let\'s expand our formula (1/n +v)/(1 +v/n )\n\nDenominator is 1 +v/n ≈1 +v/n when v small.\n\nDo a taylor expansion:\n\n(1/n + v) * (1 - v/n + (v/n)^2 - ... )\n\nFirst order is (1/n +v)(1 -v/n ) ≈1/n + v - (1/n)(v/n) -v^2/n )\n\nWhich approximates to 1/n +v (1 - 1/n² ), discarding terms with v² and higher. Therefore, matches. So at velocities v much smaller than c, the above formula gives Fizeau\'s result as an approximation, which is satisfactory.\n\nTherefore, it\'s robust.\n\nTherefore, total measure of man, heart of the question is to recognize that relativistic velocity addition is required here, leading to the expression (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n ).\n\nAnother aspect is getting confused with direction: is the light going in the same direction as the medium? If yes, the combiner speed is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, if the light was moving opposite...\n\nBut the question asserts "light beam is propagating ... glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer," so the direction of the glass/dielectric movement is along the beam direction (toward observer). Thus, applying the formula as is: velocities additive in numerator denominator. Same.\n\nThus, concluding answer is (\\dfrac{v + \\dfrac{1}{n}}{1 + \\dfrac{v}{n}}), as per velocity addition with c=1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{v + \\dfrac{1}{n}}{1 + \\dfrac{v}{n}}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743811797, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3017, prompt_tokens=766, total_tokens=3783, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the speed of light in a moving glass relative to an observer in the laboratory frame, we need to consider the relativistic velocity addition formula. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( \frac{c}{n} \). Since \( c = 1 \) (given), this speed is \( \frac{1}{n} \).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: The glass is moving with velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam relative to the laboratory frame. Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the laboratory frame \( u \) is given by:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), we get:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification and Verification**: This formula is verified by checking boundary conditions (e.g., if \( v = 0 \), the speed reduces to \( \frac{1}{n} \), and if \( n = 1 \), the speed remains \( 1 \)). The formula also matches the Fizeau experiment result for low velocities.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory frame is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{v + \dfrac{1}{n}}{1 + \dfrac{v}{n}}}
\]

 wait, perhaps we need to compute it from the velocity addition formula relative to the moving medium.

Let me think through steps using relativistic velocity addition. Suppose in the rest frame of the glass, light is moving at speed u' = c/n. Then, the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame. So, how do we transform the light's velocity from the glass frame (S') to the lab frame (S)?

The formula would be u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/c²). Since c=1, u = ( (1/n) + v )/(1 + (1/n) v ). If n is the refractive index, then 1/n is the light speed in the medium's rest frame. So substituting into this, the lab frame speed is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n). Let me calculate it as:

u = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n )

Alternatively, factoring out 1/n in the numerator and the denominator...

But for small v, this is:

Using approximation (v + (1/n))/(1 + v/n) = 1/n + v(1 - 1/n²) + O(v²), which matches Fizeau's result. So, for low v, it's approximately Fizeau's term, but the rigorous formula is u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (v/n)).

Here, the problem states the glass (medium) is moving at velocity v towards the observer. But wait! The light beam is propagating through the glass, and both glass and light are moving in the same direction, towards the observer. Wait, no: if the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam. Wait, the beam direction: in the glass, isn't the beam moving through the glass? But that's internal. So the observer is in the lab frame. The glass is moving at speed v in the same direction as the beam, moving towards the observer.

Wait, am I correctly interpreting the direction? If the glass is moving towards the observer and the light beam is moving through the glass towards the observer. So the motion of the glass is in the same direction as the beam. Therefore, in the lab frame, the light inside the moving glass will have a speed that's combination of the glass's own velocity and the velocity of light in the glass's rest frame.

But let me take frame S as the laboratory frame, and frame S’ as the glass’s rest frame moving at velocity v relative to S. In S’, the light is moving at speed u’ = c/n. We need to transform this velocity back to frame S. The light is moving in the same direction as the frame S’ is moving relative to S (assuming the glass's motion direction is same as the light direction). Then, using the velocity addition formula.

u = (u’ + v)/(1 + (u’ v)/c²) )

Since u’ is positive (if direction is same as v), and u and v are in same direction.

But again, when v is motion velocity, if S’ is moving at v with respect to S. The direction then might need coordinate systems.

Coordinate systems: Let’s straighten this out. Let's have lab frame S where observer is. Frame S’ is moving at velocity v in the +x direction (towards the observer) with respect to S. In frame S’, the light is moving in the +x direction (since same as glass's movement toward observer). The speed of light in frame S’ is u’ = c/n. Therefore, we apply the velocity addition formula to get u in lab frame S. Since S’ moves at velocity v, in S, the velocity would be (u’ + v)/(1 + (u’ v)/c² ). Since c=1, we have u = (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)v).

Simplifying the formula:

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to remove the fraction:

u = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Alternatively, keep as is: u = (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n )

That seems to agree with previous thoughts.

Alternatively, in some resources, when the medium is moving at speed v, the light speed in lab frame follows that formula.

Now, considering if the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light's motion, then light's speed should be increased by some factor due to medium's movement. Conversely, if the medium moves opposite to the light's direction, it would decrease.

Alternatively, in a medium at rest, the speed is 1/n. If the medium moves, it's not additive because of relativity.

In Fizeau's experiment, moving water with velocity v, dragged the light along with a fraction of v depending on the water's refractive index. The formula obtained was:

u = (c/n) + v(1 - 1/n²), approximately.

But according to relativistic addition, if we take u = (1/n +v )/(1 + (1/n)v ), expand this for small v (so applying Taylor expansion):

u ≈ (1/n + v)(1 - (v/n) + ... ) ≈1/n + v - (v/n² ) - (v²)/n + ... So for small v, if we ignore quadratic terms, u ≈1/n + v(1 - 1/n² ). Exactly like Fizeau's result. Hence for nonlinearizing relativistic effect, fit that formula. Thus the relativistic formula within the same direction speed ratio would explain Fizeau's result.

However, in our problem, we might just need directly use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Since the only information given is that glass is moving at v and in the same direction as light.

Alternatively, perhaps hasty observers may conclude u = 1/n + v. But that can’t be right since speed can’t exceed c=1. So if n=1.5, and u would be 2/3 +v. If, for example, v is 0.5, u= 2/3 +1/2 =7/6, which exceeds c. Not allowed. So velocity addition formula must prevent that, which the relativistic formula does. Let's check:

If u = ( (1/n) +v )/(1 + ( v/n )). So for n=1.5, v=0.5:

u=(2/3 +1/2)/(1 + (1/2)(2/3))= (4/6 +3/6)/(1 + 1/3)= (7/6)/(4/3)= (7/6)*(3/4 )=7/8 ≈0.875 <1, which is ok.

But via Galilean: 2/3 +1/2 ≈1.166 which bad.

Therefore, it must be (u’ +v)/(1 + u’ v) with u’=1/n. So the correct formula replaces the naive addition with this.

Alternatively, let me consider c to be 1, so frame S is lab, glass moves at speed v (direction towards observer), so if in the glass rest frame light speed is u'=1/n. Then the lab speed would be u = (u’ +v)/(1 + u’ v ) = (1/n +v)/(1 + (v/n )).

Alternatively, derived as follows:

In S’: x’ = (x - v t)/sqrt(1 - v² )

t’ = (t - v x)/sqrt(1 - v² )

Wait, Lorentz transformation, but if speed is entering in derivation.

Wait, the standard Lorentz transformations for velocity. As it's a bit involved.

Actually,the velocity transformation law in special relativity is derived from the Lorentz transformation.

If in Frame S’ moving at speed v relative to S in +x direction, then velocities transform as:

u = [u’ + v]/[1 + (u’ v)/c²]

So plugging u’=1/n (since speed in the medium is c/n), therefore:

u = (1/n +v)/(1 + (v/n ))>>

Yes, assuming c=1.

Adjusting units where c=1 seems simpler. Then repeating but for 1/n. So this formula indeed gives the observed speed in the lab frame.

Thus, if the velocity v that the glass is moving in lab frame is in the same direction as the light's propagation, then the speed of the light as observed in the lab should be (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n ).

Therefore, the answer would be \boxed{\dfrac{v + \dfrac{1}{n}}{1 + \dfrac{v}{n}}}.

But let me cross-check sources. In Einstein's original paper maybe or a textbook.

For example, Feynman lectures or another reference. Alternatively, consult hyperphysics.

Upon recalling, HyperPhysics has a page on moving media: According to it — light in a moving medium. For a medium with refractive index n moving at speed v, the speed of light observed is (c/n +v)/(1 + (v)/(n c))). So if c=1, this is (1/n + v)/(1 + v/n ). So aligned with our previous result.

Check: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/relcon.html#c4

The formula given here for light moving in a moving medium towards the observer in the lab frame is (c/n + v)/(1 + (v)/(n c))).

Yes, so plugging c=1 gives our result.

Therefore, it is confirmed, the standard relativistic addition gives the expression.

Hence, the answer is indeed (v + 1/n )/(1 + v/n )

But wait, an important check. If media’s speed v =0, the speed should reduce to 1/n. Let's check. Substitute v=0, getu=1/n. That checks. If media speed v approaches c, with v approaching 1 (since c=1), what is u?

Suppose v approaches 1. Then expression becomes (1/n +1)/(1 +1 /n ) = [ (1 + n)/n ] / [ (n +1)/n ]=1. So even if media moves at speed 1 (c), the light can't go faster than c, so superposition gives limit c. That's correct.

Another test: if n=1 (medium is vacuum), then speed is (v+1 )/(1 +v )=1. Obviously, because in this degenerate case, the refractive medium is vacuum, which is same as lab frame. So light must move at speed 1. All right.

Comparing to Fizeau's experiment description: refracted light in moving water. The Fizeau formula is:

u ≈ c/n + (1 -1/n²)v, which since Fizeau is valid when v is small. To check, let's expand our formula (1/n +v)/(1 +v/n )

Denominator is 1 +v/n ≈1 +v/n when v small.

Do a taylor expansion:

(1/n + v) * (1 - v/n + (v/n)^2 - ... )

First order is (1/n +v)(1 -v/n ) ≈1/n + v - (1/n)(v/n) -v^2/n )

Which approximates to 1/n +v (1 - 1/n² ), discarding terms with v² and higher. Therefore, matches. So at velocities v much smaller than c, the above formula gives Fizeau's result as an approximation, which is satisfactory.

Therefore, it's robust.

Therefore, total measure of man, heart of the question is to recognize that relativistic velocity addition is required here, leading to the expression (v + 1/n)/(1 + v/n ).

Another aspect is getting confused with direction: is the light going in the same direction as the medium? If yes, the combiner speed is necessary.

Alternatively, if the light was moving opposite...

But the question asserts "light beam is propagating ... glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer," so the direction of the glass/dielectric movement is along the beam direction (toward observer). Thus, applying the formula as is: velocities additive in numerator denominator. Same.

Thus, concluding answer is (\dfrac{v + \dfrac{1}{n}}{1 + \dfrac{v}{n}}), as per velocity addition with c=1.

**Final Answer**

The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is \boxed{\dfrac{v + \dfrac{1}{n}}{1 + \dfrac{v}{n}}}.
