# Original Question

The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.

To determine the energy threshold for high-energy gamma-rays to annihilate with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs, we need to ensure the combined energy in the center-of-momentum (CM) frame is sufficient to create the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. 

1. **Threshold Energy Calculation**:
   - The rest mass energy of an electron-positron pair is \(2 \times 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}\).
   - The invariant \(s\) for the CM frame must be at least \((2m_e c^2)^2\).
   - For two photons colliding head-on, the invariant \(s\) is given by \(4 E_\gamma \epsilon\), where \(E_\gamma\) is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and \(\epsilon\) is the energy of the CMB photon.
   - Setting \(4 E_\gamma \epsilon = (2 m_e c^2)^2\), we solve for \(E_\gamma\):
     \[
     E_\gamma = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon}
     \]

2. **Substitute Values**:
   - \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV}\)
   - \(\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}\)
   - Calculate:
     \[
     E_\gamma = \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{261,121,000,000 \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 261,121,000,000,000 \, \text{eV} = 261 \, \text{TeV}
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Gamma-rays with energies above approximately 261 TeV will have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons due to the pair production process \(\gamma \gamma \rightarrow e^+ e^-\).

\[
\boxed{261 \, \text{TeV}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out at what energy gamma-rays would start having their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average energy of a CMB photon is given as 10^-3 eV. Let me start by recalling the basic physics involved here.

The process in question is γ + γ → e+ + e-. For this reaction to occur, the energy of the two photons must be sufficient to create the rest mass of the electron and positron. Since each electron has a rest mass energy of about 0.511 MeV, the combined rest mass energy needed is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. 

But wait, the threshold energy for pair production usually involves the center-of-momentum (CM) frame energy. The photons need enough energy so that their combined energy in the CM frame exceeds the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. So maybe I need to calculate the threshold condition where the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon is just enough to create the pair.

Let me set up the problem. Let's denote the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray as E_γ and the energy of the CMB photon as ε = 1e-3 eV. The threshold occurs when the total energy squared in the CM frame equals (2me c^2)^2. The total energy squared in the CM frame is given by (E_γ + ε)^2 - (p_γ c - p_CMB c)^2. But since photons are massless, their energy is related to their momentum by E = pc. So the momentum of the high-energy photon is E_γ / c and the momentum of the CMB photon is ε / c. However, since the photons are colliding, I need to consider their directions. If they are moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite, so the total momentum would be E_γ / c - ε / c if one is moving in the positive direction and the other in the negative. But since the CMB photons are isotropic, but the high-energy gamma is probably propagating in a specific direction. Hmm, but for the threshold condition, it's worst case when the CMB photon is moving directly opposite to the high-energy gamma, so that their collision maximizes the CM energy.

So, threshold condition:

In the lab frame (where maybe the CMB is isotropic, but for maximum effect, when they collide head-on), the total energy squared in the CM frame is:

s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2 

Wait, momentum of high-energy photon is E_γ/c in, say, the +z direction, and the CMB photon has energy ε and momentum ε/c in the -z direction. So total momentum is E_γ/c - ε/c. So the total energy in CM frame squared is:

s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2 * c^2

Wait, no, hold on. The invariant s is the square of the total four-momentum. For two photons, their four-momenta are (E_γ/c, E_γ/c, 0, 0) and (ε/c, -ε/c, 0, 0), assuming they are moving along the x-axis. Then the total four-momentum is (E_γ + ε)/c, (E_γ - ε)/c, 0, 0). So the invariant s is [(E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2] / c^2. Wait, but that can't be, because s should have units of energy squared. Let me recheck.

Wait, actually, the four-momentum of the first photon is (E_γ/c, E_γ/c, 0, 0) and the second is (ε/c, -ε/c, 0, 0). Therefore, the total energy is (E_γ + ε)/c and the total momentum is (E_γ/c - ε/c) in the x-direction. The invariant s is (sum p_mu)^2 = (sum E/c)^2 - (sum **p** c)^2. So:

s = [(E_γ + ε)/c]^2 c^4 - [(E_γ/c - ε/c) c]^2 c^2

Wait, perhaps I should recall the more straightforward formula. The invariant s for two particles is:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2

But since for photons, p = E/c, the above becomes:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2, since if they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta add as vectors, so p1 c is in one direction and p2 c in the opposite.

Expanding that, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] = 4 E1 E2.

Ah! That simplifies nicely. So the Mandelstam variable s is 4 E1 E2. Then, since s must be at least (2 me c^2)^2 for the pair production to occur, the threshold condition is:

4 E_γ ε >= (2 me c^2)^2

Therefore:

E_γ >= (2 me c^2)^2 / (4 ε) = (me c^2)^2 / ε

But wait, let's check the dimensions. The left side is energy squared, so each side here has to be in energy squared. What's (me c^2)^2 / ε? Well, me c^2 is energy, so (energy)^2 divided by energy is energy, which is correct. So yes, we can write:

E_γ >= (me c^2)^2 / (4 ε)

But wait, let me redo the steps carefully to avoid any miscalculations. The invariant s is 4 E_γ ε. The threshold s = (2 me c^2)^2. Thus 4 E_γ ε = 4 (me c^2)^2, leading to E_γ ε = (me c^2)^2. Therefore,

E_γ = (me c^2)^2 / ε

Wait, but that leads to E_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)

0.511 MeV is 0.511 * 1e6 eV = 5.11e5 eV

Thus, (5.11e5 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (2.61e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 eV

Which is 2.61e8 TeV? Wait, 1 TeV is 1e12 eV, so 2.61e14 eV is 261 TeV.

But I thought the threshold was around 1 TeV for E_γ with CMB photons. Hmm, maybe I messed up a factor of 4 somewhere?

Wait, in the calculation above, when considering s, we said s = 4 E_γ ε. Then, threshold s = (2 me c^2)^2. Setting those equal:

4 E_γ ε = (2 me c^2)^2  
So, E_γ ε = (me c^2)^2

Therefore,

E_γ = (me c^2)^2 / ε = (0.511 MeV)^2 / 1e-3 eV

But perhaps this factor of me c^2 in MeV: 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

Therefore,

511,000 eV * 511,000 eV = (511,000)^2 (eV)^2

Divide by 1e-3 eV:

511,000^2 / 1e-3 eV = (261,121e6) / 1e-3 eV = 261,121,000 eV = 2.61121e11 eV = 261.121 GeV

Wait, 511,000^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10 eV^2, divided by 1e-3 eV gives 26.11e10 / 1e-3 = 26.11e13 eV = 261.1e12 eV = 261.1 TeV? Wait, hold on. Let's compute 511,000 * 511,000:

511 * 10^3 * 511 * 10^3 = 511^2 * 10^6

511^2:

500^2 = 250,000  
11^2 = 121  
2 * 500 * 11 = 11,000  
So, (500 + 11)^2 = 261,121

Therefore, 511^2 * 10^6 = 261,121 * 10^6 = 2.61121e0.11, wait that's eV squared.

Wait, no: me c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV. (m_e c^2)^2 is (511,000 eV)^2.

Therefore, (511,000 eV)^2 = 511,000 * 511,000 (eV)^2 = 261,121,000,000 eV^2

Divide that by the CMB photon energy ε = 1e-3 eV:

261,121,000,000 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 261,121,000,000 / 0.001 eV = 261,121,000,000,000 eV = 2.61121e14 eV

Convert that to TeV:

1 TeV = 1e12 eV,

So E_γ = 2.61121e14 / 1e12 = 261.121 TeV

Wait, so over 200 TeV. But I thought the threshold was lower. Hmmm.

Wait, but maybe we need to consider that high-energy gamma rays propagating through the CMB. The CMB photon's energy is 1e-3 eV, but they have a Planck distribution. However, the problem states the average energy is 1e-3 eV. Well, we can take that value for the energy of the CMB photon.

But when I search my memory, I recall that the threshold for pair production against the CMB (which has ~1e-3 eV photons) is about 1 TeV for the gamma ray energy. But according to this calculation, it's ~260 TeV. That seems inconsistent. Where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I confused the direction of the photons. If the high-energy photon collides with a CMB photon at an angle, that would reduce the effectiveness. Because the cross-section for pair production is maximum when the photons are head-on, and it's kinematically allowed.

But in reality, CMB photons are all around, isotropic, so you need to integrate over all angles. But in the worst case, head-on collision gives the maximal s, so when someone talks about the threshold energy, it's for the head-on collision, so photons that are moving in opposite directions. Because otherwise, if they are moving in the same direction, their relative energy would be lower.

Hence, for the maximum cross-section, the interaction is when photons collide head-on, so that the threshold energy is minimal. Wait, if photons can collide at different angles, which one would lower the threshold?

Hmmm. Wait, actually when photons are moving in the same direction, their relative energy is minimized, making pair production harder. When they come from opposite directions, the collision energy in the CM frame is maximized, allowing the threshold to be lowest. Therefore, the threshold energy given previously (261 TeV) is actually for collisions when they approach head-on, but if the impact is at some angle, then requiring higher energies to pair produce.

But since the CMB photon bath is isotropic, to actually calculate the effective energy threshold, really, the worst case is head-on, so that gamma-rays with energy above the threshold calculated in that way can interact with some fraction of the CMB photons. However, to find the typical energy where the mean free path becomes comparable to the size of the universe, one often considers this threshold energy. But in reality, due to the angular dependence, the actual cross-section peaks around certain energy which is lower. Wait, perhaps I need to check again.

But the problem says: "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So, essentially, the energy above which gamma-rays cannot propagate over cosmological distances due to pair production on the CMB.

I think this is a standard result, called the gamma-ray horizon. And the threshold is known as about ~100 TeV for CMB, but let me see.

Wait, let me see Hawking’s original paper? No, but actually, just by units.

Wait, my calculation gives (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon.

Using m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, yes?

So (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2) * 1e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 * 1e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.

So ~260 TeV.

But according to standard results, the threshold for interaction with CMB photons (which have ~0.001 eV energy) is actually about 1e14 eV which is 100 TeV.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied s. Let's check again.

The invariant s is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2. For two photons moving in opposite directions, sum E is E_γ + ε, sum p c is E_γ/c * c - ε/c * c = E_γ - ε. So,

s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2 = 4 E_γ ε.

Then, s needs to be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2.

So,

4 E_γ ε = (2 m_e c^2)^2

So,

E_γ = (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (4 ε) = (m_e c^2)^2 / (ε) 

But wait, should there be any factors of c here? Let's recheck the units.

Yes, maybe we're working in units where c=1 which can complicate.

Wait, in natural units, where c=1 and E (in eV) and mass m (eV/c^2). Wait, no, in natural units, actually, c=1 and energies and masses are in eV.

But in this case, we might need to put the correct units. Let's check again.

The energy of the high-energy gamma is E_γ in eV. The energy of the CMB photon is ε in eV. The rest mass energy of the electron is m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

The invariant s has units of energy^2. But since the photons are moving in the same line, then the invariant s would indeed be 4 E_γ ε. But need to express this in proper units? In the formula for pair production, when do you get an exact threshold? Let's look up. 

Alternatively, we can use the formula for photon-photon pair production threshold, which for collision angles of 180 degrees (head-on) is given by:

E_γ * ε ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / (1 - cosθ)

where θ is the angle between the two photon directions, so for head-on, θ = 180 degrees, and 1 - cosθ = 2. Hence,

E_γ * ε ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / 2

But wait...

Wait, here's a different formula: the threshold condition when the product of the energies of the two photons in the system where they are colliding head-on is such that

E_γ ε (1 - cosθ) = 2 (m_e c^2)^2

Wait, some sources indicate this. Maybe when angle θ is the angle between photon directions, so for head-on collision, θ = π, cosθ = -1, so 1 - cosθ = 2, so:

E_γ ε * 2 ≥ 2 (m_e c^2)^2

Thus,

E_γ ε ≥ (m_e c^2)^2

So back to original expression, which gives:

E_γ ≥ (m_e c^2)^2/(ε) 

But according to that, yes, that would be. So for ε = 1e-3 eV,

E_γ ≥ (511e3 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)

= 261.121e6 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 261.121e9 eV = 261 GeV

Hold on, that's 261 GeV? But different other sources (like Prof. Jim Cronin's lectures or textbooks on high-energy astrophysics) say that the threshold for the CMB is about 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV.

This discrepancy suggests I have a mistake in my calculation.

Let me redo the calculation with more precise numbers.

Given:

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV

epsilon = 1e-3 eV

So,

E_γ = (m_e c^2 )^2 / epsilon = (511,000 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV

Compute 511,000^2:

511,000 * 511,000 = 511^2 * 10^6

511^2 = (500 +11)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*11 + 11^2=250000 + 11000 + 121=261,121

Thus, 511,000^2 = 261,121 * 1e6= 2.61121e11 eV^2

Divide by 1e-3 eV:

E_γ = (2.61121e11 eV^2) / 1e-3 eV = 2.61121e14 eV = 261.121e12 eV = 261.121 TeV

So apparently, 261 TeV.

But according to literature, is this so?

Wait, if Gamma-rays above ~80 TeV would be attenuated by the CMB. Let me check some references.

Quickly, check Wikipedia's article on "Pair production". It says: "the photon must have higher energy than 1.02 MeV to allow production of an electron-positron pair when it interacts with, for example, a nucleus. However, if two photons are involved, then the threshold is lower: the sum of the photon energies in the center-of-mass frame must exceed 1.02 MeV. This means that photon–photon pair production can occur for lower energy photons if they collide with very high energy gamma rays or other electromagnetic waves."

But in the case of CMB photons at ~1meV (milli-eV) or 1e-3 eV. Suppose a high-energy gamma photon. Then, substituting into the formula:

E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon. Therefore,

E_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (0.001 eV) =? Let's compute in another way.

Convert 0.511 MeV to eV: 511,000 eV.

So E_γ = (511,000)^2 / 0.001 eV

Which is (511,000 * 511,000) eV / 0.001

= 261,121,000,000 eV / 0.001

= 261,121,000,000,000 eV

Convert to TeV: 261,121,000,000,000 eV / 1,000,000,000,000 eV/TeV = 261.121 TeV ≈ 260 TeV.

So according to this, the threshold energy is about 260 TeV. However, common knowledge (based on books) says that the pair production cross-section for gamma-rays on CMB peaks at energies around 1 TeV. This may be a confusion of cosmic microwave background versus the infrared background? Wait, the EBL (extragalactic background light) which is in the infrared has higher photon energies (eV to tens of eV), therefore requiring lower gamma-ray energies to pair produce. Hence, for interactions with EBL (few eV), the threshold is ~100 GeV to TeV.

But for CMB (1e-3 eV), interaction with higher energy gamma-rays would be in the hundreds of TeV.

Wait, Maybe there is a confusion here. So according to standard models, the microwave background (CMB) starts to limit gamma-rays above around 1e14 eV (100 TeV) with a mean free path smaller than cosmological scales. Hence, above ~10-100 TeV, gamma-rays can't travel over large extragalactic distances.

But maybe that's roughly consistent with the 261 TeV derived here.

But most literature quotes Electromagnetic cascades.

Alternatively, maybe the cross-section becomes significant before the threshold. Because even though the threshold is part of the process, photons need not collide exactly head-on. Even if their collision has some angle leading to higher total CM energy. Wait, actually, if they have a collision angle of less than 180 degrees, the product E1 * E2 * (1 - cosθ) would vary. Then the maximum occurs at θ = 180 degrees, leading to the product E1 E2 * 2. If angles are smaller, then 1 - cosθ < 2, so higher energy is required.

However, when you do integrate the cross-section over the angles and a Planck distribution, the effective threshold is somewhat lower. So perhaps instead of saying E_γ ~ 260 TeV, they use an average for cross-section leading to a universe opacity threshold ~100 TeV. Hmm.

But given that in this problem, the average photon energy is stated as 1e-3 eV. So perhaps the question is meant to be using the head-on collision assumption. Therefore, exactly working out the head-on threshold, which gives 261 TeV approximately.

So, given the formula E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε

Given m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV

Then,

E_γ = (0.511e6 eV )*(0.511e6 eV) / 1e-3 eV

= (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV

= 0.261 * 1e12 eV

= 2.61e11 eV

= 261 GeV

Wait, that's different again. Wait, Now If I compute that way:

(E_γ in GeV) = (0.511 GeV)^2 / (1e-12 GeV)

Wait It's a miscalculation!

Hold on, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV. Which in eV is 511,000 eV, which is 511 kilo-eV. Wait.

Wait, first: the rest mass energy of the electron is 0.511 MeV, which is 511,000 eV. but converting that to GeV, it's 0.000511 GeV, or 511 MeV.

OKay, Then:

E_γ needs to be (511,000 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV

As above, 511,000 squared over 1e-3:

511,000 is 5.11e5, square is (5.11)^2 (1e5)^2 = 26.11 x 1e10 = 2.611e11 eV^2.

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 2.611e11 eV^2 / 1e-3 eV = 2.611e14 eV = 261.1 TeV.

Yes, that's over 260 TeV, but literature sometimes says that interactions with CMB impose a cutoff at around 10s of TeV. Maybe there's another consideration, such as the distribution not only of angle but of energy?

Alternatively, note that the CMB photons have a blackbody spectrum with average photon energy around k_B * T, T ~ 2.7 K. Let me confirm: CMB temperature is 2.7 K. So, the temperature corresponds to energy k_B * T. Let's compute it.

k_B is Boltzmann constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K. Then, 2.7 K * 8.617e-5 eV/K = 2.7 *8.617e-5 eV ~ 23.27e-5 eV = 0.002327 eV. Wait, close to the 1e-3 eV given in the problem. Maybe the average is about 0.0006 or something, but the problem says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV.

If it's actually T=2.7 K:

k_B*T=8.617e-5 *2.7 ≈ 0.0002327 eV. So typical CMB photon energy is closer to 0.000233 eV. The problem states average is 1e-3 eV. So, perhaps the question uses a higher average energy. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem simplifies to take the average as 1e-3 eV. Then, under simple head-on collision, that's 261 TeV. But maybe actually for thermal distribution, the effective energy is considered to be higher. Or perhaps, if minimum energy is needed. Wait, wait, but if question just gives it as 1e-3 eV, I don't need to bring Planck spectrum into play. The problem says average energy CMB photon is 1e-3 eV, so assuming this value.

Given that, E_γ ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon_cmb.

So, substituting in the numbers, its 261 TeV. However, that answer seems at variance with standard values, so maybe they assume a different approach.

Wait a second - perhaps there's confusion between laboratory frame. Historically, the famous Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff is about protons interacting with CMB photons, but also applicable to gamma-rays. But for protons it's ~1e20 eV. For photons, called the Breit-Wheeler process?Gamma-rays interacting with CMB(?)

However， when referring to Breit-Wheeler process, where two photons interact to produce electron-Pair. To have a cross section that's non-zero,光子能量必须满足一定的阈值。

Breit和Wheeler提出了这个，其阈能条件给出的。公式是正确的，对我来说，阈值能量由我们推导出来的是正确的。

So strictly answering the question, given in the problem statement, I think the answer is 261 TeV. Therefore, if a gamma-ray has energy of about 260 TeV, when colliding with a 1e-3 eV CMB photon, it can produce e+ e-. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above this value would annihilate, thus their lifetime would be limited.

But why do I think the answer is different? Because from previous studies, for pair production against the CMB, the threshold energy is higher than the typical literature values.

However, perhaps the confusion here coming from reshifting? Since the CMB energy is redshift-dependent. For a cosmic gamma-ray traveling through the expanding universe, the CMB photon energy is now 1e-3 eV, but in the past when the universe was smaller, the CMB had higher energy. Hence, the effective energy threshold over the photon's propagation varies. So specifically, even for lower energy gamma-rays, distant sources could suffer pair production as older CMB photons had higher energy.

But this calculation isn't considering that; the problem is giving the average CMB photon energy currently. Suppose current CMB energy, then asking at what gamma-s energy current CMB photons would pair-produce annihilate them, determining their lifetime. If they're around now, if their energy is higher than the threshold, then they’d interact with current CMB photons. So what would be the current threshold like.

Thus, the answer would indeed be ~261 TeV. Since the purpose of the question is to consider gamma-ray propagating today, encountering CMB photons with an average energy of 1e-3 eV.

But missing factors? Maybe in standard formula divided by (1+z), but if questioning current epoch, z=0, so CMB is 1e-3 eV today. So even if that's higher in past, unless the problem assumes journey from distant source where higher CMB energies affect.

But actual number derived is E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε = (0.511 MeV)^2/(10^{-3} eV) = as above.

As a result, I think my own initial calculation was correct: ~261 TeV. But since many sources state this threshold different (some not). Wait: If it's an exam problem, well, given the problem provides (average CMB photons) and the formula, the answer must be the calculated one. Otherwise the literature often goes into much more complex aspects.

Alternatively,  maybe I made unit error when combining the energy.

Wait, recapping:

- Calculate (m_e c^2)^2 / ε = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)


Convert 0.511 MeV to eV: 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

= (511,000 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV

= 261,121,000,000 eV^2 / 0.001 eV

= 261,121,000,000,000 eV

= 261.121 TeV.

Exactly.

Which is approximately 300 TeV. Since the problem says "from what energy ... limited by this process", which would be approximately when the mean free path due to pair production is on the order of the age/distance of the universe. But when individual photon-pairs can interact, for head-on collisions, the threshold is around 260 TeV. The mean free path would depend on the cross-section. However, beyond that threshold energy, the cross-section is significant, and the mean free path may drop sharply. Therefore, above this 261 TeV, even though photons can interact, it's the energy at which the time/lifetime becomes limited. So even if the cross-section is low, when averaging over many CMB photons, the optical depth becomes about one at near that energy.

Assuming that the number density of CMB photons is sufficient to allow for the interaction on cosmological scales.

But the CMB has high number density. The number density is about 400 photons/cm^3. So once above the threshold, perhaps the attenuation is strong.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, they assume that option is just above the threshold. Therefore,to answer the posed...

**Final Answer**
\boxed{261 \, \text{TeV}}

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out at what energy gamma-rays would start having their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average energy of a CMB photon is given as 10^-3 eV. Let me start by recalling the basic physics involved here.

The process in question is γ + γ → e+ + e-. For this reaction to occur, the energy of the two photons must be sufficient to create the rest mass of the electron and positron. Since each electron has a rest mass energy of about 0.511 MeV, the combined rest mass energy needed is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. 

But wait, the threshold energy for pair production usually involves the center-of-momentum (CM) frame energy. The photons need enough energy so that their combined energy in the CM frame exceeds the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. So maybe I need to calculate the threshold condition where the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and the CMB photon is just enough to create the pair.

Let me set up the problem. Let's denote the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray as E_γ and the energy of the CMB photon as ε = 1e-3 eV. The threshold occurs when the total energy squared in the CM frame equals (2me c^2)^2. The total energy squared in the CM frame is given by (E_γ + ε)^2 - (p_γ c - p_CMB c)^2. But since photons are massless, their energy is related to their momentum by E = pc. So the momentum of the high-energy photon is E_γ / c and the momentum of the CMB photon is ε / c. However, since the photons are colliding, I need to consider their directions. If they are moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite, so the total momentum would be E_γ / c - ε / c if one is moving in the positive direction and the other in the negative. But since the CMB photons are isotropic, but the high-energy gamma is probably propagating in a specific direction. Hmm, but for the threshold condition, it's worst case when the CMB photon is moving directly opposite to the high-energy gamma, so that their collision maximizes the CM energy.

So, threshold condition:

In the lab frame (where maybe the CMB is isotropic, but for maximum effect, when they collide head-on), the total energy squared in the CM frame is:

s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2 

Wait, momentum of high-energy photon is E_γ/c in, say, the +z direction, and the CMB photon has energy ε and momentum ε/c in the -z direction. So total momentum is E_γ/c - ε/c. So the total energy in CM frame squared is:

s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2 * c^2

Wait, no, hold on. The invariant s is the square of the total four-momentum. For two photons, their four-momenta are (E_γ/c, E_γ/c, 0, 0) and (ε/c, -ε/c, 0, 0), assuming they are moving along the x-axis. Then the total four-momentum is (E_γ + ε)/c, (E_γ - ε)/c, 0, 0). So the invariant s is [(E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2] / c^2. Wait, but that can't be, because s should have units of energy squared. Let me recheck.

Wait, actually, the four-momentum of the first photon is (E_γ/c, E_γ/c, 0, 0) and the second is (ε/c, -ε/c, 0, 0). Therefore, the total energy is (E_γ + ε)/c and the total momentum is (E_γ/c - ε/c) in the x-direction. The invariant s is (sum p_mu)^2 = (sum E/c)^2 - (sum **p** c)^2. So:

s = [(E_γ + ε)/c]^2 c^4 - [(E_γ/c - ε/c) c]^2 c^2

Wait, perhaps I should recall the more straightforward formula. The invariant s for two particles is:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2

But since for photons, p = E/c, the above becomes:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2, since if they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta add as vectors, so p1 c is in one direction and p2 c in the opposite.

Expanding that, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] = 4 E1 E2.

Ah! That simplifies nicely. So the Mandelstam variable s is 4 E1 E2. Then, since s must be at least (2 me c^2)^2 for the pair production to occur, the threshold condition is:

4 E_γ ε >= (2 me c^2)^2

Therefore:

E_γ >= (2 me c^2)^2 / (4 ε) = (me c^2)^2 / ε

But wait, let's check the dimensions. The left side is energy squared, so each side here has to be in energy squared. What's (me c^2)^2 / ε? Well, me c^2 is energy, so (energy)^2 divided by energy is energy, which is correct. So yes, we can write:

E_γ >= (me c^2)^2 / (4 ε)

But wait, let me redo the steps carefully to avoid any miscalculations. The invariant s is 4 E_γ ε. The threshold s = (2 me c^2)^2. Thus 4 E_γ ε = 4 (me c^2)^2, leading to E_γ ε = (me c^2)^2. Therefore,

E_γ = (me c^2)^2 / ε

Wait, but that leads to E_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)

0.511 MeV is 0.511 * 1e6 eV = 5.11e5 eV

Thus, (5.11e5 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (2.61e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 eV

Which is 2.61e8 TeV? Wait, 1 TeV is 1e12 eV, so 2.61e14 eV is 261 TeV.

But I thought the threshold was around 1 TeV for E_γ with CMB photons. Hmm, maybe I messed up a factor of 4 somewhere?

Wait, in the calculation above, when considering s, we said s = 4 E_γ ε. Then, threshold s = (2 me c^2)^2. Setting those equal:

4 E_γ ε = (2 me c^2)^2  
So, E_γ ε = (me c^2)^2

Therefore,

E_γ = (me c^2)^2 / ε = (0.511 MeV)^2 / 1e-3 eV

But perhaps this factor of me c^2 in MeV: 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

Therefore,

511,000 eV * 511,000 eV = (511,000)^2 (eV)^2

Divide by 1e-3 eV:

511,000^2 / 1e-3 eV = (261,121e6) / 1e-3 eV = 261,121,000 eV = 2.61121e11 eV = 261.121 GeV

Wait, 511,000^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10 eV^2, divided by 1e-3 eV gives 26.11e10 / 1e-3 = 26.11e13 eV = 261.1e12 eV = 261.1 TeV? Wait, hold on. Let's compute 511,000 * 511,000:

511 * 10^3 * 511 * 10^3 = 511^2 * 10^6

511^2:

500^2 = 250,000  
11^2 = 121

Alright, I need to determine the energy threshold at which gamma-rays have their lifetimes constrained by annihilation with CMB photons to create electron-positron pairs. I know the average CMB photon energy is 10^-3 eV, and I'll examine the physics of this interaction.

The reaction I'm studying is γ + γ → e+ + e-. For this pair production to occur, the interacting photons must provide enough energy to create the rest mass of both particles. Each electron/positron has a rest mass energy of 0.511 MeV, requiring a total of 1.022 MeV.

I need to consider this in the center-of-momentum (CM) frame, where the threshold condition occurs when the combined energy is just sufficient to produce the electron-positron pair.

Let me designate the high-energy gamma-ray energy as E_γ and the CMB photon energy as ε (10^-3 eV). For maximum interaction probability, I'll consider head-on collisions between these photons.

For two photons traveling in opposite directions, the Mandelstam variable s (invariant mass squared) simplifies to:
s = 4 E_γ ε

At threshold, this must equal the square of the total rest energy of the pair:
4 E_γ ε = (2 me c^2)^2

Solving for E_γ:
E_γ = (me c^2)^2 / ε

Substituting the values:
E_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^-3 eV)

Converting to consistent units:
0.511 MeV = 5.11 × 10^5 eV

Therefore:
E_γ = (5.11 × 10^5 eV)^2 / (10^-3 eV)
    = 2.61 × 10^11 eV^2 / 10^-3 eV
    = 2.61 × 10^14 eV

Converting to more appropriate units:
E_γ = 261 TeV

However, I expected a threshold around 1 TeV for gamma-ray interactions with CMB photons, so I may need to review my calculation for a possible error in factors.

Let me double-check: (511,000)^2 = 2.61 × 10^11, divided by 10^-3 gives 2.61 × 10^14 eV, which equals 261 TeV.

Alright, I need to determine the energy above which gamma-rays' lifetimes are limited due to their annihilation with CMB photons, resulting in electron-positron pairs. The average energy for a CMB photon is approximately 10^-3 eV. Let's go through the relevant physics principles here.

The process we're focusing on is given by γ + γ → e+ + e-. For this reaction to happen, the energy from both photons must be adequate to match the rest mass energy of an electron and a positron pair. Each electron's rest mass energy is roughly 0.511 MeV, so the total needed rest mass energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

However, keep in mind that the condition for pair production typically takes into account the energy in the center-of-momentum (CM) frame. Photons need enough energy such that their combined energy in the CM frame exceeds the electron-positron rest mass energy. Thus, it's necessary to calculate when the energy of a high-energy gamma-ray and a CMB photon is sufficient for pair creation.

Setting up the scenario, let's call the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray E_γ and the CMB photon energy ε = 10^-3 eV. The threshold is met when the total energy squared in the CM frame matches (2me c^2)^2. The total energy in the CM frame squared is given by (E_γ + ε)^2 - (p_γ c - p_CMB c)^2. Considering that photons have no mass, their energy equals their momentum times c, or E = pc. Therefore, the momentum of the gamma-ray is E_γ / c and for the CMB photon is ε / c. Since the photons collide, their directions are essential. Assuming they move towards each other, with opposite momenta, the total momentum would be E_γ / c - ε / c if one is positive and the other negative. For maximum effect, assume the CMB photon directly opposes the gamma-ray, enhancing the CM energy for their collision.

So, setting the threshold condition: 

In the lab frame (assuming the CMB isotropy, but for head-on collision impact), the total energy squared in the CM frame is:

s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2 

Now, note, momentum of the high-energy photon is E_γ / c along, say, the +z axis, with the CMB photon having energy ε and momentum ε / c going -z direction. Hence, total momentum equates to E_γ / c - ε / c. Therefore, the CM total energy squared:

s = (E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2 * c^2

No, let's reassess. The invariant s is the square of the combined four-momentum. For two photons, their four-momentum vectors are (E_γ/c, E_γ/c, 0, 0) and (ε/c, -ε/c, 0, 0), assuming all movement along the x-axis. Hence, total four-momentum is (E_γ + ε)/c, (E_γ - ε)/c, 0, 0). Thus, invariant s becomes [(E_γ + ε)^2 - (E_γ - ε)^2] / c^2. Hold on, that's incorrect as s should be in energy squared. Let's reverify.

Actually, photon 1's four-momentum is (E_γ/c, E_γ/c, 0, 0), while photon 2's is (ε/c, -ε/c, 0, 0). Then, total energy sums to (E_γ + ε)/c, with momentum (E_γ/c - ε/c) in the x-direction. The invariant s follows (sum p_mu)^2 = (sum E/c)^2 - (sum **p** c)^2. So:

s = [(E_γ + ε)/c]^2 c^4 - [(E_γ/c - ε/c) c]^2 c^2

Let's revisit the basic equation. The invariant s for two particles is:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2

Credits to the relation for photons: p = E/c, hence:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2, because when moving in opposite courses, momenta add via vectors, and p1 c counterbalances p2 c.

Simplifying, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2] = 4 E1 E2.

This simplifies aptly. The Mandelstam variable s equals 4 E1 E2. Since s must minimally equate (2 me c^2)^2 for pair production, threshold requires:

4 E_γ ε >= (2 me c^2)^2

Thus:

E_γ >= (2 me c^2)^2 / (4 ε) = (me c^2)^2 / ε

Verify dimensions: the LHS denotes energy squared, so both sides should match the unit. Here, (me c^2)^2 / ε yields energy, adequate. Hence:

E_γ >= (me c^2)^2 / (4 ε)

Let's retrace the steps thoroughly for accuracy. Starting with invariant s is 4 E_γ ε. The threshold assigns s = (2 me c^2)^2. Setting equality:

4 E_γ ε = 4 (me c^2)^2  
Thus, E_γ ε = (me c^2)^2:

E_γ = (me c^2)^2 / ε

This calculates to E_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^-3 eV)

0.511 MeV equates to 0.511 * 10^6 eV = 5.11 * 10^5 eV

Hence, (5.11 * 10^5 eV)^2 / 10^-3 eV equals (2.61 * 10^11 eV^2) divided by 10^-3 eV = 2.61 * 10^14 eV = 2.61 * 10^14 eV

Which results in 2.61 * 10^8 TeV? Note 1 TeV equals 10^12 eV, so 2.61 * 10^14 eV approximates 261 TeV.

I initially assumed the threshold should be near 1 TeV for E_γ with CMB photons, maybe I overlooked a factor of 4?

Reassessing: during s computation, we set s = 4 E_γ ε. Realigning at threshold s = (2 me c^2)^2 yields:

4 E_γ ε = (2 me c^2)^2  
Thus, E_γ ε = (me c^2)^2

Therefore:

E_γ = (me c^2)^2 / ε = (0.511 MeV)^2 / 1e-3 eV

Attempting once more with me c² in MeV: 0.511 MeV corresponds to 511,000 eV.

So,

511,000 eV * 511,000 eV = (511,000)^2 (eV)^2

Dividing by 1e-3 eV:

511,000^2 / 1e-3 eV = (261,121 * 10^6) / 1e-3 eV = 261,121,000 eV or 2.61121 * 10^11 eV amounting to 261.121 GeV

Retrospectively, 511,000^2 = (5.11 * 10^5)^2 = 26.11 * 10^10 eV^2, divided by 1e-3 eV becomes 26.11 * 10^10 / 1e-3 = 26.11 * 10^13 eV equating to 261.1 * 10^12 eV or 261.1 TeV. Let's verify 511,000 times 511,000:

511 * 10^3 * 511 * 10^3 leads to 511^2 * 10^6

Performing 511^2, where:

500^2 results in 250,000  
11^2 gives 121

Then divided by 1e-3 eV:\n\n272,121e6 / 1e-3 = 272,121e9 eV = 272,121 GeV = 272.121 TeV ≈ 272 TeV.\n\nWait, that can\'t be right because I believe the typical threshold energy quoted is about 1 TeV. So that must mean either there is a miscalculation here or a misunderstanding in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I should check some references. The process described is pair production, the Breit-Wheeler process. The critical energy for a high-energy photon to annihilate with a low-energy photon to produce an electron-positron pair is given when the product of their energies (in the center-of-momentum frame) exceeds the square of the electron mass, as we derived. However, in a head-on collision, the threshold is lower. Wait, but from our calculation above, E_γ = (me c^2)^2 / ε. Let\'s plug in numbers.\n\nme c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.\n\nε = 1e-3 eV.\n\nTherefore,\n\nE_γ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.261e12 eV^2) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nHmm, but I recall that the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit is roughly around 6e19 eV (60 EeV) for cosmic protons interacting with CMB photons, but for photons, since they would pair produce with CMB photons, the so-called threshold is actually lower. But maybe we have conflicting processes here. Wait, the question is about gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons. For example, the gamma-ray needs to have enough energy that when interacting with a CMB photon, their combined energy is sufficient for pair production. That case, the threshold is given by E_γ * ε ≥ (me c^2)^2 (with angles considered). Wait, but in the calculation above, we required that E_γ ε (assuming head-on collision) must equal (me c^2)^2. So the threshold energy would be E_γ ~ (me c^2)^2 / ε. With numbers as 261 TeV. But 261 TeV is about 2.61e14 eV.\n\nBut wait, from literature, the threshold energy for gamma-rays interacting with CMB photons is indeed around a few hundred TeV (about 100 TeV to 1 PeV). For example, 80 TeV for cosmic infrared background, but here using CMB (which is lower energy) but maybe similar threshold? Wait, according to Pauli\'s lecture notes, the threshold energy is given by E_threshold (epsilon / 1 eV)^{-1} ~ 500 TeV. But CMB is about 1e-3 eV, which would put E_threshold ~500 TeV * (epsilon /1 eV)^{-1} = 500 TeV / (1e-3/1) = 500 TeV / 1e-3 = 500,000 TeV = 5e5 TeV ≈ 5e8 GeV. Wait, that seems even larger, which contradicts previous.\n\nWait, there\'s confusion here, maybe.\n\nAnother approach. Let\'s think in terms of collision in the lab frame where one photon is the high-energy one with energy E_γ and the other is at rest. Wait, but photons can\'t be at rest. Alternatively, they can use angles. The cross-section for pair production γ + γ → e+ e- is not just dependent on the energies but also on the angle between them. The cross-section is maximized when they collide head-on, which gives the lowest threshold energy.\n\nThe general formula for pair production threshold is that the two photons have to have energies E1 and E2 such that:\n\n2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ) >= (2 me c^2)^2,\n\nwhere θ is the angle between their propagation directions. If they collide head-on, θ = π, so 1 - cosθ = 2. So:\n\n4 E1 E2 >= (2 me c^2)^2  \nE1 E2 >= (me c^2)^2\n\nThus, for a head-on collision, the product of the energies must be greater than (me c^2)^2. Therefore, if one photon has energy ε (CMB photon\'s energy ~1e-3 eV), then the high-energy photon must have energy E_γ >= (me c^2)^2 / ε.\n\nWhich is as before, because that would satisfy the threshold: E_γ * ε >= (me c^2)^2.\n\nPlugging the numbers:\n\nme c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV\n\n(me c^2)^2 = (511,000 eV)^2 = 261,121,000,000 eV² = 2.61121 x 10^11 eV²\n\nDivide by ε = 1e-3 eV:\n\nE_γ = 2.61121 x 10^11 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 2.61121 x 10^14 eV = 261 TeV\n\nSo approximately 261 TeV. So the answer should be about 260 TeV or 3 x10^14 eV. Now, perhaps in the problem statement, they want the answer in some unit. But since it was phrased as "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process". So this process would start to become significant for gamma-rays above this energy, so this threshold is critical energy beyond which the universe becomes opaque to gamma-rays due to pair production on the CMB.\n\nTherefore, the energy is around ~300 TeV. But wait, some sources actually say that the threshold for pair production on the CMB is lower. Wait, let me check for some known values. For example, in the context of the GZK limit for photons, which is due to pair production on the CMB, the threshold is indeed around 1e14 eV to 1e15 eV (100 TeV to 1 PeV). So 261 TeV seems within that range, so maybe it\'s correct.\n\nBut wait, I think that when considering CMB photons, the temperature is about 2.7 K, which corresponds to photon energies around 0.001 eV (as given), so our setup is correct. Hence, combining it via E_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / 10^{-3} eV is the way to go.\n\nBut another thing. Wait, the CMB photons have a black body spectrum, so it\'s not monochromatic at 1e-3 eV, but the average energy is 1e-3 eV. The peak is around 1e-3 eV (since T = 2.7 K corresponds to k_B T ≈ 0.23 meV, which is 0.23e-3 eV. Wait, hold on. If average energy is given as 1e-3 eV, but the actual average energy of a black body photon is about 2.7 k_B T. Well:\n\nRoom temperature, 300 K: k_B T ≈ 1/40 eV ≈ 0.025 eV. But for CMB, T ≈ 2.7 K, so k_B T ≈ 2.7 * 8.617e-5 eV/K ≈ 2.327e-4 eV. So the average photon energy would be about 2.7 k_B T ≈ 6.3e-4 eV, so near 1e-3 eV. But then CMB peak wavelength is about 1 mm, corresponding to energy hc/lambda ≈ 1240 eV nm / 1e6 nm = 1.24e-3 eV. So that\'s even in the ballpark.\n\nHowever, I think that when you calculate the threshold for interaction with CMB photons, you might need to account for their actual distribution. But the problem states: "average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3} eV". Therefore, maybe the problem wants you to use that average energy in calculation. Then our previous calculation remains, giving approx 261 TeV.\n\nBut maybe my original calculation is wrong. Let\'s see if alternative approaches agree.\n\nAlternative method: find the photon energy such that, when combined with the CMB photon, the invariant mass is at least 2m_e c^2.\n\nGiven two photons with energies E_γ and ε, their combined invariant mass is sqrt(2 E_γ ε (1 - cosθ)), where θ is the angle between them. To reach 2m_e c^2, require that:\n\nsqrt(2 E_γ ε (1 - cosθ)) >= 2 m_e c^2\n\nSo (2 E_γ ε (1 - cosθ)) >= (2 m_e c^2)^2  \nE_γ >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (2 ε (1 - cosθ))\n\nTo get the maximal effect (minimum E_γ), set the minimal angle, θ = π (head-on collision) ⇒ 1 - cosπ = 1 - (-1) = 2. Hence, equations reduce again to E_γ >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (2 ε * 2) = (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (4 ε) => same as E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε,  the same result as before. Therefore, that\'s correct.\n\nThus, the answer is approximately 260 TeV. Converting 261 TeV to more precise terms with significant figures, given the inputs were approximate (average CMB photon energy is 1e-3 eV, but could be about 0.7 mm, etc.), so it\'s commonly quoted in papers as approximately 100 TeV. Wait, but discrepancy arises. Wait, wait - maybe. Hmm, considering that the cross-section increases as you go above the threshold. The actual absorption of Γ-rays would start becoming significant not exactly at threshold but a bit higher. However, the problem asks "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" which likely means the threshold itself. If an extragalactic gamma-ray has energy above this threshold, it can annihilate with CMB photons. Therefore, the existence of such a cutoff predicts that we should see few gamma-rays above this energy.\n\nChecking some references, the threshold for pair production on CMB is ~ 10^14 eV (100 TeV) excluding redshift effects. However, with E_γ = (m e c^2)^2 / epsilon.\n\nComputed we get 260 TeV, whereas in reality, extragalactic sources have gamma-rays attenuated above ~20 TeV or so, but perhaps considering more precise CMB photon energies and angle averaging. Wait, but likely discrepancy comes from the fact that even though the average energy is ~1e-3 eV, there\'s a distribution of photon energies. Using the average might not give the exact threshold.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Use peak energy of CMB.\n\nThe CMB peak wavelength is ~1 mm. Using E = hc/lambda, where hc ≈ 1240 eV nm. 1 mm is 1e6 nm. So hc/lambda = 1240 eV nm / 1e6 nm = 1.24e-3 eV, which is the peak. So maybe considering that me c^2 is 0.511 MeV. Then, (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1.24e-3 eV) = (0.511)^2 / 1.24 * 1e12 eV = 0.213 * 1e12 eV = 2.13e11 eV = 213 TeV. So that\'s about 210 TeV.\n\nBut the CMB has a distribution of photons. Even if the peak is at 1e-3 eV, there\'s a tail towards higher energies. So the maximum energy in the CMB photon distribution is at Wien tail. However, the interaction rate will then depend on the cross-section and the photon number density above a certain energy. Therefore, even a small number of higher-energy CMB photons can contribute, but at the average energy quoted, the threshold would be related to 200 TeV. Yet literature suggests photon-photon pair production opacity (Egret observations, etc.), but detailed calculations require integration over all possible energies and angles.\n\nGiven that the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. So in the problem\'s context, accepting that average, the threshold should be around 260 TeV, which converts to about 2.6 X 10^14 eV.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be approx. 260 TeV.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the energy threshold for gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, we start by considering the energy required for the process \(\gamma + \gamma \rightarrow e^+ e^-\). The rest mass energy of an electron-positron pair is \(2 \times 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}\). The threshold condition is derived using the invariant mass squared \(s\) of the two-photon system, which must be at least \((2 m_e c^2)^2\).

The invariant mass squared \(s\) for two photons with energies \(E_\gamma\) (high-energy gamma-ray) and \(\varepsilon\) (CMB photon) colliding head-on is given by:
\[
s = 4 E_\gamma \varepsilon
\]
Setting \(s\) equal to \((2 m_e c^2)^2\), we get:
\[
4 E_\gamma \varepsilon = (2 m_e c^2)^2
\]
Solving for \(E_\gamma\):
\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\varepsilon}
\]
Substituting the values \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV}\) and \(\varepsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}\):
\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(511,000)^2}{10^{-3}} \, \text{eV} = \frac{261,121,000,000}{10^{-3}} \, \text{eV} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy threshold for gamma-rays to be limited by annihilation with CMB photons is approximately:
\[
\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

500*11 = 11,000  
So 511^2 = (500 + 11)^2 = 250,000 + 11,000 + 11,000 + 121 = 250,000 + 22,000 + 121 = 272,121

Therefore, 272,121 * 10^6 eV^2. Then divided by 1e-3 eV:

272,121e6 / 1e-3 = 272,121e9 eV = 272,121 GeV = 272.121 TeV ≈ 272 TeV.

Wait, that can't be right because I believe the typical threshold energy quoted is about 1 TeV. So that must mean either there is a miscalculation here or a misunderstanding in the setup.

Wait, maybe I should check some references. The process described is pair production, the Breit-Wheeler process. The critical energy for a high-energy photon to annihilate with a low-energy photon to produce an electron-positron pair is given when the product of their energies (in the center-of-momentum frame) exceeds the square of the electron mass, as we derived. However, in a head-on collision, the threshold is lower. Wait, but from our calculation above, E_γ = (me c^2)^2 / ε. Let's plug in numbers.

me c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

ε = 1e-3 eV.

Therefore,

E_γ = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.261e12 eV^2) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.

Hmm, but I recall that the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit is roughly around 6e19 eV (60 EeV) for cosmic protons interacting with CMB photons, but for photons, since they would pair produce with CMB photons, the so-called threshold is actually lower. But maybe we have conflicting processes here. Wait, the question is about gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons. For example, the gamma-ray needs to have enough energy that when interacting with a CMB photon, their combined energy is sufficient for pair production. That case, the threshold is given by E_γ * ε ≥ (me c^2)^2 (with angles considered). Wait, but in the calculation above, we required that E_γ ε (assuming head-on collision) must equal (me c^2)^2. So the threshold energy would be E_γ ~ (me c^2)^2 / ε. With numbers as 261 TeV. But 261 TeV is about 2.61e14 eV.

But wait, from literature, the threshold energy for gamma-rays interacting with CMB photons is indeed around a few hundred TeV (about 100 TeV to 1 PeV). For example, 80 TeV for cosmic infrared background, but here using CMB (which is lower energy) but maybe similar threshold? Wait, according to Pauli's lecture notes, the threshold energy is given by E_threshold (epsilon / 1 eV)^{-1} ~ 500 TeV. But CMB is about 1e-3 eV, which would put E_threshold ~500 TeV * (epsilon /1 eV)^{-1} = 500 TeV / (1e-3/1) = 500 TeV / 1e-3 = 500,000 TeV = 5e5 TeV ≈ 5e8 GeV. Wait, that seems even larger, which contradicts previous.

Wait, there's confusion here, maybe.

Another approach. Let's think in terms of collision in the lab frame where one photon is the high-energy one with energy E_γ and the other is at rest. Wait, but photons can't be at rest. Alternatively, they can use angles. The cross-section for pair production γ + γ → e+ e- is not just dependent on the energies but also on the angle between them. The cross-section is maximized when they collide head-on, which gives the lowest threshold energy.

The general formula for pair production threshold is that the two photons have to have energies E1 and E2 such that:

2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ) >= (2 me c^2)^2,

where θ is the angle between their propagation directions. If they collide head-on, θ = π, so 1 - cosθ = 2. So:

4 E1 E2 >= (2 me c^2)^2  
E1 E2 >= (me c^2)^2

Thus, for a head-on collision, the product of the energies must be greater than (me c^2)^2. Therefore, if one photon has energy ε (CMB photon's energy ~1e-3 eV), then the high-energy photon must have energy E_γ >= (me c^2)^2 / ε.

Which is as before, because that would satisfy the threshold: E_γ * ε >= (me c^2)^2.

Plugging the numbers:

me c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV

(me c^2)^2 = (511,000 eV)^2 = 261,121,000,000 eV² = 2.61121 x 10^11 eV²

Divide by ε = 1e-3 eV:

E_γ = 2.61121 x 10^11 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 2.61121 x 10^14 eV = 261 TeV

So approximately 261 TeV. So the answer should be about 260 TeV or 3 x10^14 eV. Now, perhaps in the problem statement, they want the answer in some unit. But since it was phrased as "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process". So this process would start to become significant for gamma-rays above this energy, so this threshold is critical energy beyond which the universe becomes opaque to gamma-rays due to pair production on the CMB.

Therefore, the energy is around ~300 TeV. But wait, some sources actually say that the threshold for pair production on the CMB is lower. Wait, let me check for some known values. For example, in the context of the GZK limit for photons, which is due to pair production on the CMB, the threshold is indeed around 1e14 eV to 1e15 eV (100 TeV to 1 PeV). So 261 TeV seems within that range, so maybe it's correct.

But wait, I think that when considering CMB photons, the temperature is about 2.7 K, which corresponds to photon energies around 0.001 eV (as given), so our setup is correct. Hence, combining it via E_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / 10^{-3} eV is the way to go.

But another thing. Wait, the CMB photons have a black body spectrum, so it's not monochromatic at 1e-3 eV, but the average energy is 1e-3 eV. The peak is around 1e-3 eV (since T = 2.7 K corresponds to k_B T ≈ 0.23 meV, which is 0.23e-3 eV. Wait, hold on. If average energy is given as 1e-3 eV, but the actual average energy of a black body photon is about 2.7 k_B T. Well:

Room temperature, 300 K: k_B T ≈ 1/40 eV ≈ 0.025 eV. But for CMB, T ≈ 2.7 K, so k_B T ≈ 2.7 * 8.617e-5 eV/K ≈ 2.327e-4 eV. So the average photon energy would be about 2.7 k_B T ≈ 6.3e-4 eV, so near 1e-3 eV. But then CMB peak wavelength is about 1 mm, corresponding to energy hc/lambda ≈ 1240 eV nm / 1e6 nm = 1.24e-3 eV. So that's even in the ballpark.

However, I think that when you calculate the threshold for interaction with CMB photons, you might need to account for their actual distribution. But the problem states: "average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3} eV". Therefore, maybe the problem wants you to use that average energy in calculation. Then our previous calculation remains, giving approx 261 TeV.

But maybe my original calculation is wrong. Let's see if alternative approaches agree.

Alternative method: find the photon energy such that, when combined with the CMB photon, the invariant mass is at least 2m_e c^2.

Given two photons with energies E_γ and ε, their combined invariant mass is sqrt(2 E_γ ε (1 - cosθ)), where θ is the angle between them. To reach 2m_e c^2, require that:

sqrt(2 E_γ ε (1 - cosθ)) >= 2 m_e c^2

So (2 E_γ ε (1 - cosθ)) >= (2 m_e c^2)^2  
E_γ >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (2 ε (1 - cosθ))

To get the maximal effect (minimum E_γ), set the minimal angle, θ = π (head-on collision) ⇒ 1 - cosπ = 1 - (-1) = 2. Hence, equations reduce again to E_γ >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (2 ε * 2) = (2 m_e c^2)^2 / (4 ε) => same as E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε,  the same result as before. Therefore, that's correct.

Thus, the answer is approximately 260 TeV. Converting 261 TeV to more precise terms with significant figures, given the inputs were approximate (average CMB photon energy is 1e-3 eV, but could be about 0.7 mm, etc.), so it's commonly quoted in papers as approximately 100 TeV. Wait, but discrepancy arises. Wait, wait - maybe. Hmm, considering that the cross-section increases as you go above the threshold. The actual absorption of Γ-rays would start becoming significant not exactly at threshold but a bit higher. However, the problem asks "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" which likely means the threshold itself. If an extragalactic gamma-ray has energy above this threshold, it can annihilate with CMB photons. Therefore, the existence of such a cutoff predicts that we should see few gamma-rays above this energy.

Checking some references, the threshold for pair production on CMB is ~ 10^14 eV (100 TeV) excluding redshift effects. However, with E_γ = (m e c^2)^2 / epsilon.

Computed we get 260 TeV, whereas in reality, extragalactic sources have gamma-rays attenuated above ~20 TeV or so, but perhaps considering more precise CMB photon energies and angle averaging. Wait, but likely discrepancy comes from the fact that even though the average energy is ~1e-3 eV, there's a distribution of photon energies. Using the average might not give the exact threshold.

Alternatively, another approach: Use peak energy of CMB.

The CMB peak wavelength is ~1 mm. Using E = hc/lambda, where hc ≈ 1240 eV nm. 1 mm is 1e6 nm. So hc/lambda = 1240 eV nm / 1e6 nm = 1.24e-3 eV, which is the peak. So maybe considering that me c^2 is 0.511 MeV. Then, (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1.24e-3 eV) = (0.511)^2 / 1.24 * 1e12 eV = 0.213 * 1e12 eV = 2.13e11 eV = 213 TeV. So that's about 210 TeV.

But the CMB has a distribution of photons. Even if the peak is at 1e-3 eV, there's a tail towards higher energies. So the maximum energy in the CMB photon distribution is at Wien tail. However, the interaction rate will then depend on the cross-section and the photon number density above a certain energy. Therefore, even a small number of higher-energy CMB photons can contribute, but at the average energy quoted, the threshold would be related to 200 TeV. Yet literature suggests photon-photon pair production opacity (Egret observations, etc.), but detailed calculations require integration over all possible energies and angles.

Given that the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. So in the problem's context, accepting that average, the threshold should be around 260 TeV, which converts to about 2.6 X 10^14 eV.

Therefore, the answer would be approx. 260 TeV. However, TeV is 1e12 eV, so 260 TeV is 2.6e14 eV.

Therefore, boxed answer: \boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}} or in TeV, \boxed{260 \text{ TeV}} but since the question doesn't specify units, maybe go with the eV.

But let me check with lecturers' problems. Generally, energy might be requested in eV. Given that 0.511 MeV is known, computed above ≈2.6e5 MeV = 2.6e11 keV =2.6e14 eV. So yes, that's consistent.

**Final Answer**
The energy threshold is \boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}.

No.\n\nAlternatively: Maybe it\'s (m_e c^2) * Epsilon_cmb ~ ?\n\nAlternatively, I found a miscalculation.

For highest s (so more probable?), but in terms of interaction, the universe is filled with isotropic CMB photons. The threshold calculation must consider the most probable angle.\n\nBut in the rest frame of the high-energy photon (if that makes sense since photons don\'t have a rest frame...) Alternatively, perhaps evaluate in the lab frame where the CMB photon is part of the thermal background. However, since the CMB is isotropic, on average there will be photons that collide head-on with the high-energy photon. So for the most effective interaction, maximal s, so θ=180°, hence s=4 E_γ ε.\n\nSo correct threshold relation is 4 E_γ ε = (2 m_e c²)² => E_gamma = (m_e c²)^2 / ε\n\nThus, my original calculation leads to 261 TeV.\n\nBut maybe there\'s a nuance here. It\'s possible that the CMB photon\'s energy is such that the interaction becomes efficient when the high-energy photon\'s energy exceeds this threshold. So gamma-rays with energies above 261 TeV would interact significantly with CMB radiation and be absorbed, limiting their lifetime.\n\nBut I recall that the universe is opaque to gamma-rays above ~100 TeV due to interaction with CMB photons, well some tension here. However, if calculation gives 261 TeV, maybe I need to check the calculations again. Let\'s see:\n\nGiven: m_e c² ≈ 0.511 MeV = 5.11 × 10^5 eV\n\nε (CMB photon energy): 1e-3 eV\n\nThen:\n\nThreshold E_γ = (m_e c²)^2 / ε = (5.11e5 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV ≈ (26.11e10 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 26.11e13 eV = 261.1e12 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nSo indeed, 261 TeV. However, if the CMB photon energy is average, perhaps looking at the target photons with highest possible energy in the CMB? The CMB follows a blackbody spectrum with peak around 1e-3 eV, but there exists a Wien tail with some low number of higher energy photons, maybe up to 1e-2 eV or more. The threshold is lower for higher energy CMB photons. So, if you use higher CMB photon energies, the required gamma-ray energy would be lower. Conversely, E_gamma scales inversely with epsilon.\n\nBut since the problem states average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, so the calculation indeed gives 261 TeV. However, confusion arises because the known cutoff is often considered around tens of TeV. Wait, let\'s check literature for excess.\n\nUpon recalling, the cosmic gamma-ray horizon, or the gamma-ray attenuation due to pair production on CMB photons, typically leads to a threshold around E_γ ~100 TeV. But according to our calculation based on the average energy, 261 TeV. Perhaps a realistic calculation uses the energy distribution of CMB photons (blackbody spectrum) and calculates the cross-section for interaction over various possible target photon energies, integrating over the distribution. Maybe considering only thermal photons with a certain energy that can produce enough pairs? Or perhaps the energy we calculate here is the peak energy for highest cross-section.\n\nBut given that the problem provides the average photon energy of 1e-3 eV and asks straightforwardly for the threshold, so the answer based on formula is 261 TeV.\n\nWait, but linearity. Let me check invariances again. The formula for threshold is s ≥ 4 m_e²c^4.\n\nBy s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (p_gamma c - p_cmb c)^2. For head-on collision, that\'d be (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (E_gamma/c - E_cmb/c)^2 c^2.\n\nExpanding: (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (E_gamma - E_cmb)^2 = [E_gamma² + 2 E_gamma E_cmb + E_cmb²] - [E_gamma² - 2 E_gamma E_cmb + E_cmb²] = 4 E_gamma E_cmb.\n\nSo s = 4 E_gamma E_cmb\n\nSet equal to (2 m_ec²)^2 = 4 m_e²c^4.\n\nTherefore same as before. Hence:\n\n4 E_gamma E_cmb = 4 m_e² c^4 => E_gamma = m_e² c^4 / E_cmb. Correct you are replacing m_e c^2 > with m_e²c^4 as it\'s actually m_e²c^4 requires division by E_cmb.\n\nBut energies are in eV. So m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.\n\nThus:\n\nE_gamma = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) =  (261.121e12 eV² ) / (1e-3 eV ) = 261.121e15 eV = 2.61121e+20 eV? Wait, this can\'t be right. Wait hang on—units! Wait, (electron mass in energy unit)^2 / (average photon energy)\n\nIn (eV)^2/(eV) = eV. So with:\n\n(511,000 eV (which is 0.511 MeV))^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (511,000)^2 * eV^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) = (511,000)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (511^2 * 1e4 / 1e-3) eV )\n\nWait, 511,000 = 5.11e5, so squared is (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10. Divided by 1e-3 gives 26.11e10 / 1e-3 = 26.11e13 eV. Since 1e12 eV = 1 TeV, so 26.11e13 eV = 261.1e12 eV = 261.1 TeV.\n\nThere we go. So correct, 261 TeV. Hmm, but when considering that the universe has CMB photons with some energy distribution, is the average photon here considered for a threshold? Or, maybe in reality, interactions are possible with lower energy gamma-rays if the CMB photons have higher energies (from the Wien tail). However, the CMB blackbody spectrum\'s specific intensity peaks at around 1e-3 eV and drops exponentially at higher energies, but it\'s not clear how much of the photon population exists above say 1e-2 eV or so, making the majority of interactions actually involve the lower energy photons. Thus, the threshold isn\'t a sharp cutoff but a gradual attenuation.\n\nHowever, since the problem posits "the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^−3 eV" and explicitly asks "from what energy γ-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?", they are likely asking for the threshold energy based on that average photon.\n\nBut in reality, the attenuation ( mean free path ) depends on integration over the CMB spectrum. However, the number of photons with higher energies in the CMB is very small, so the cross-section is dominated by the integral. However, from the problem\'s wording, since they ask for energy where gamma-ray lifetime is limited by the process, they\'re looking for the gamma-ray energy for which interactions with CMB photons become energetically possible. So it\'s likely the threshold. Hence 261 TeV.\n\nBut question is, many sources note that starting at around tens of TeV, extragalactic γ-rays are absorbed by the extragalactic background light (EBL) and earlier, such as the CMB. But perhaps higher thresholds apply.\n\nBut let\'s check a reference. From knowledge, talk about the interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with the CMB:\n\nThe pair production attenuation length for gamma-rays in the CMB would be shortest (lifetime shortest) when they encounter photons energetic enough to allow pair production. If the photons are of lower energy (like CMB), the required gamma-ray energy scales as E_γ ≃ ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / ε_CMB.\n\nSo (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = roughly ( (0.5e6)^2 ) / 1e-3 ) eV = 0.25e12 / 1e-3 = 0.25e15 eV = 250 TeV. So maybe ~100 TeV is an average attenuation, but specific threshold is approx 250 TeV. Thus the answer would require Eγ ~ 100s TeV.\n\nSince the problem wants to know from which energy the lifetime is "limited", which would be the critical energy above which the cross-section becomes sizable.

To determine the energy threshold at which gamma-rays have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons to create electron-positron pairs, we start by noting the average energy of CMB photons is \(10^{-3} \text{ eV}\). The process $\gamma + \gamma \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ requires the combined energy of the photons to be at least the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is \(2 \times 0.511 \text{ MeV} = 1.022 \text{ MeV}\).

The key steps involve calculating the invariant mass squared \(s\) of the two-photon system in the center-of-momentum (CM) frame. For head-on collisions, the invariant mass squared is given by:
\[
s = 4 E_\gamma \varepsilon
\]
where \(E_\gamma\) is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and \(\varepsilon = 10^{-3} \text{ eV}\) is the energy of the CMB photon. At the threshold of pair production, this invariant mass must equal the square of the total rest energy of the pair:
\[
4 E_\gamma \varepsilon = (2 m_e c^2)^2
\]
Solving for \(E_\gamma\):
\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\varepsilon}
\]
Substituting the rest mass energy of the electron \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \text{ MeV} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \text{ eV}\) and the CMB photon energy \(\varepsilon = 10^{-3} \text{ eV}\):
\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(5.11 \times 10^5 \text{ eV})^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}} = \frac{2.61 \times 10^{11} \text{ eV}^2}{10^{-3} \text{ eV}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV} = 261 \text{ TeV}
\]

Thus, the energy threshold for gamma-rays to be limited by annihilation with CMB photons is \(\boxed{261\ \text{TeV}}\).

 Hmmm, another source indicates that the gamma-ray photon requires energy E_γ ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 ε). Did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I confused the Mandelstam variable expression. Let me re-examine.

For two photons with energies E1 and E2 colliding at angle θ, the invariant mass squared is:

s = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cos θ)

At threshold (minimum energy needed), they should collide head-on, so θ = 180 degrees, making cos θ = -1. Then,

s = 2 E1 E2 (1 - (-1)) = 4 E1 E2

Setting s equal to the squared sum of rest masses (since s at threshold equals (sum of rest masses)^2):

4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c^2)^2 => E1 E2 = m_e c^2^2

Therefore:

E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2

Substituting E2 (CMB photon energy, 1e-3 eV) gives:

E1 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)
    = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV
    = (2.61e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV)
    = 2.61e14 eV
    = 261 TeV

But earlier confusion about expecting ~1 TeV threshold. Why?

Alternative source says that the typical threshold energy for pair production on CMB is E_γ ~ (m_e c^2)(m_e c^2)/(epsilon) ~ (0.5 GeV)(0.5 GeV)/ (1e-3 eV). Wait, that calculation would actually give 0.25e9^2 /1e-3 = 6.25e19 eV, which can't be right. No.

Alternatively: Maybe it's (m_e c^2) * Epsilon_cmb ~ ?

Alternatively, I found a miscalculation. Let me reassess using the formula for cross-section threshold.

The correct threshold relation is derived from the invariant s:

s ≥ (2 m_e c²)²

Using s = 2 E_γ ε (1 - cosθ)

Assuming interaction with the CMB photon, and assuming θ is the angle between their directions. For highest s (so more probable?), but in terms of interaction, the universe is filled with isotropic CMB photons. The threshold calculation must consider the most probable angle.

But in the rest frame of the high-energy photon (if that makes sense since photons don't have a rest frame...) Alternatively, perhaps evaluate in the lab frame where the CMB photon is part of the thermal background. However, since the CMB is isotropic, on average there will be photons that collide head-on with the high-energy photon. So for the most effective interaction, maximal s, so θ=180°, hence s=4 E_γ ε.

So correct threshold relation is 4 E_γ ε = (2 m_e c²)² => E_gamma = (m_e c²)^2 / ε

Thus, my original calculation leads to 261 TeV.

But maybe there's a nuance here. It's possible that the CMB photon's energy is such that the interaction becomes efficient when the high-energy photon's energy exceeds this threshold. So gamma-rays with energies above 261 TeV would interact significantly with CMB radiation and be absorbed, limiting their lifetime.

But I recall that the universe is opaque to gamma-rays above ~100 TeV due to interaction with CMB photons, well some tension here. However, if calculation gives 261 TeV, maybe I need to check the calculations again. Let's see:

Given: m_e c² ≈ 0.511 MeV = 5.11 × 10^5 eV

ε (CMB photon energy): 1e-3 eV

Then:

Threshold E_γ = (m_e c²)^2 / ε = (5.11e5 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV ≈ (26.11e10 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 26.11e13 eV = 261.1e12 eV = 261 TeV.

So indeed, 261 TeV. However, if the CMB photon energy is average, perhaps looking at the target photons with highest possible energy in the CMB? The CMB follows a blackbody spectrum with peak around 1e-3 eV, but there exists a Wien tail with some low number of higher energy photons, maybe up to 1e-2 eV or more. The threshold is lower for higher energy CMB photons. So, if you use higher CMB photon energies, the required gamma-ray energy would be lower. Conversely, E_gamma scales inversely with epsilon.

But since the problem states average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, so the calculation indeed gives 261 TeV. However, confusion arises because the known cutoff is often considered around tens of TeV. Wait, let's check literature for excess.

Upon recalling, the cosmic gamma-ray horizon, or the gamma-ray attenuation due to pair production on CMB photons, typically leads to a threshold around E_γ ~100 TeV. But according to our calculation based on the average energy, 261 TeV. Perhaps a realistic calculation uses the energy distribution of CMB photons (blackbody spectrum) and calculates the cross-section for interaction over various possible target photon energies, integrating over the distribution. Maybe considering only thermal photons with a certain energy that can produce enough pairs? Or perhaps the energy we calculate here is the peak energy for highest cross-section.

But given that the problem provides the average photon energy of 1e-3 eV and asks straightforwardly for the threshold, so the answer based on formula is 261 TeV.

Wait, but linearity. Let me check invariances again. The formula for threshold is s ≥ 4 m_e²c^4.

By s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (p_gamma c - p_cmb c)^2. For head-on collision, that'd be (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (E_gamma/c - E_cmb/c)^2 c^2.

Expanding: (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (E_gamma - E_cmb)^2 = [E_gamma² + 2 E_gamma E_cmb + E_cmb²] - [E_gamma² - 2 E_gamma E_cmb + E_cmb²] = 4 E_gamma E_cmb.

So s = 4 E_gamma E_cmb

Set equal to (2 m_ec²)^2 = 4 m_e²c^4.

Therefore same as before. Hence:

4 E_gamma E_cmb = 4 m_e² c^4 => E_gamma = m_e² c^4 / E_cmb. Correct you are replacing m_e c^2 > with m_e²c^4 as it's actually m_e²c^4 requires division by E_cmb.

But energies are in eV. So m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

Thus:

E_gamma = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) =  (261.121e12 eV² ) / (1e-3 eV ) = 261.121e15 eV = 2.61121e+20 eV? Wait, this can't be right. Wait hang on—units! Wait, (electron mass in energy unit)^2 / (average photon energy)

In (eV)^2/(eV) = eV. So with:

(511,000 eV (which is 0.511 MeV))^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (511,000)^2 * eV^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) = (511,000)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (511^2 * 1e4 / 1e-3) eV )

Wait, 511,000 = 5.11e5, so squared is (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10. Divided by 1e-3 gives 26.11e10 / 1e-3 = 26.11e13 eV. Since 1e12 eV = 1 TeV, so 26.11e13 eV = 261.1e12 eV = 261.1 TeV.

There we go. So correct, 261 TeV. Hmm, but when considering that the universe has CMB photons with some energy distribution, is the average photon here considered for a threshold? Or, maybe in reality, interactions are possible with lower energy gamma-rays if the CMB photons have higher energies (from the Wien tail). However, the CMB blackbody spectrum's specific intensity peaks at around 1e-3 eV and drops exponentially at higher energies, but it's not clear how much of the photon population exists above say 1e-2 eV or so, making the majority of interactions actually involve the lower energy photons. Thus, the threshold isn't a sharp cutoff but a gradual attenuation.

However, since the problem posits "the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^−3 eV" and explicitly asks "from what energy γ-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?", they are likely asking for the threshold energy based on that average photon.

But in reality, the attenuation ( mean free path ) depends on integration over the CMB spectrum. However, the number of photons with higher energies in the CMB is very small, so the cross-section is dominated by the integral. However, from the problem's wording, since they ask for energy where gamma-ray lifetime is limited by the process, they're looking for the gamma-ray energy for which interactions with CMB photons become energetically possible. So it's likely the threshold. Hence 261 TeV.

But question is, many sources note that starting at around tens of TeV, extragalactic γ-rays are absorbed by the extragalactic background light (EBL) and earlier, such as the CMB. But perhaps higher thresholds apply.

But let's check a reference. From knowledge, talk about the interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with the CMB:

The pair production attenuation length for gamma-rays in the CMB would be shortest (lifetime shortest) when they encounter photons energetic enough to allow pair production. If the photons are of lower energy (like CMB), the required gamma-ray energy scales as E_γ ≃ ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / ε_CMB.

So (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = roughly ( (0.5e6)^2 ) / 1e-3 ) eV = 0.25e12 / 1e-3 = 0.25e15 eV = 250 TeV. So maybe ~100 TeV is an average attenuation, but specific threshold is approx 250 TeV. Thus the answer would require Eγ ~ 100s TeV.

Since the problem wants to know from which energy the lifetime is "limited", which would be the critical energy above which the cross-section becomes sizable. Hence the threshold energy at about 261 TeV. Even if the gamma-ray has that energy, even though the cross-section might be low, but approaching that energy regime, interactions start to occur.

Given that the problem has given the average photon energy (epsilon=1e-3 eV), the answer should be Eγ = 261 TeV. Hence, the step-by-step aside is okay. So the final answer would be 261 TeV. So expressed in box: \boxed{261\ \text{TeV}}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{261\ \text{TeV}}

But here, ε = 1e-3 eV, so how do students usually approach this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps errors surface in the collision kinematics.

Wait, regardless, how comes:\n\nGotten 261 TeV as calculated here.\n\nIs there a step misapplied?\n\nWait, the average energy of CMB is like 1e-3 eV but with peak energy. Let’s recall perhaps reshifting through temperature. CMB has a temperature of about 2.7 K. The average photon energy for a Planck distribution is approximately 2.7 k_B T. However, the average photon energy in CMB is approximately around 0.001 eV (which makes sense because T is ≈2.7 K → in eV, k_B T ≈ (8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K) * 2.7 K ≈ 2.3 × 10^-4 eV, which might imply that the average energy is ~ (roughly 0.00023 eV). But in the question, it states the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV, a bit higher. Though maybe that could be a typo, but per the question itself, we have to go with 10^-3 eV.\n\nMoving on. Regardless, with values approximately 10^-3 eV. So me c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV, then (511,000)^2 / (1e-3) eV:\n\nAgain, 511,000 eV times 511,000 eV / 1e-3 eV = (511,000)^2 / 1e-3. Let's handle 511,000^2: as above it's 261,121,000,000 eV². Thus, when you divide by 1e-3 eV, that's 261,121,000,000 / 0.001 eV = 261,121,000,000,000 eV = 261,121 TeV.\n\nWait, the exponent here is 0.511 MeV, and calculations give 261,121 TeV. But 1 TeV is 10^12 eV. Therefore, 261,000 TeV would be 2.61e+14 eV. However, when converting the equation:\n\nme c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 10^6 eV  \n(me c^2)^2 = (0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 = 0.261 × 10^12 eV²\n\nDivide this by ε = 1e-3 eV,\n\nSo E_γ = (0.261 × 10^12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 0.261 × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nYes, indeed, that’s confirmation and hence 261 TeV, which is approximately 300 TeV, potentially rounding.\n\nMoreover, this appears to be in line with the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, though the GZK limit deals with protons interacting with CMB photons at ~1e20 eV, leading to pion production because the threshold is lower (p + γ → pion), though different process entirely. Therefore, analysts conclude for photon-photon pair production, the threshold is indeed hundreds of TeV. However, this may depend on which photon background we're referring to.\n\nThe point is, this calculation shows that in order for a gamma-ray to annihilate with a CMB photon (assuming 1e-3 eV) to make an electron-positron pair, the gamma-ray must have energy on the order of hundreds of TeV. Hence, above that energy, the gamma-rays interact with the CMB such that their mean free path becomes limited, leading to degradation via pair production, hence the lifetime in the universe is restricted. Hence, the answer is E_γ ≈ (me c^2)^2 / ε = ~261 TeV.\n\nBut as I double-check, Oh! Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the invariant s initial calculation—whether it includes the angle between photons. Unless we consider head-on collisions, the photon momenta vectors could collide at some angle. The worst case is when photons approach head-on. For maximum possible interaction, the angle is 180 degrees.\n\nThe formula 4 E1 E2 / (1 - cos θ) >= (2 me c^2)^2. At the threshold, when considering the minimum energy required, the maximum energy threshold occurs when photons are head-on, as then it's minimized. Actually, that expression:\n\nThe general condition involves the angle θ between the two photon directions. The invariant s is given by:\n\ns = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cos θ)\n\nBut if they're moving the same direction, θ =0, so s would tend to 0. For opposite directions, θ = π, so 1 - cos θ = 2, which gives maximum s.\n\nWait! Therefore, previous derivation the maximum s=s_max=4ε E_γ.\n\nSo, head-on collisions produce the largest possible s, which are best able to reach the threshold for pair production. Under lower angles, lower s for same E1 and E2.\n\nSo specifically, if the gamma-ray has Energy E_γ and the CMB photon has E_CMB=ε=1e-3 eV, then maximum s is s=4 E_γ ε. To produce an e+ e- pair requires s = (2 me c^2)^2. Thus, when s = (2 me c^2)^2:\n\n4 E_γ ε >= (2 me c^2)^2  \nTherefore,\n\nE_γ >= ( (2 me c^2)^2 ) / (4 ε ) = (me c^2)^2 / Epsilon\n\nThus, precisely correct,\n\nE_γ ≈ ( (0.511 MeV )^2 ) / 1e-3 eV.\n\nThat's accurate. Plugging in the numbers:\n\n(0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.261e12 eV^2 ) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 eV * (1 TeV /1e12 eV) )= 261 TeV\n\nWait, yes. That computation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be ~300 TeV, so around 261.1 TeV. So, gamma-rays with energies above ~260 TeV would interact with the CMB photons via pair production, hence this would limit their mean free path in the universe.\n\nTherefore, the universe is opaque to gamma-rays above approximately 260 TeV due to pair-production on the CMB. Therefore, the critical energy is this value. Consequently, gamma-rays with energies ≳ 10^14 eV = 100 TeV are mostly absorbed; however, precise calculation here gives 261 TeV as the threshold.\n\nPerhaps quoting with two significant figures: 2.6 × 10^14 eV, which is 260 TeV.\n\nTherefore, summarizing: the process γγ → e+e- has a threshold energy dependent on the product of the two photons' energies. For a CMB photon with ~10^-3 eV, the high-energy photon's energy must be such that their combined invariant mass reaches at least the electron-positron rest mass. Numerically, we have ~ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ≈ 261 TeV, above which gamma-rays annihilate effectively with CMB photons, thus their lifespan or propagation distance in the universe gets limited.\n\nIn extraterrestrial gamma-ray astrophysics, this effect is part of why we observe a drop-off (cutoff) in the gamma-ray spectrum at ultra-high energies since gamma-rays from distant sources annihilate with the pervasive CMB—forming electron-positron pairs—reducing their flux. Therefore, the answer being around hundreds of TeVs, as provided.\n\nThus, converting 261 TeV to proper units, TeV vs eV:\n\n261 TeV = 261,000 GeV = 261,000 x 10^9 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV. So written as 2.6 x10^14 eV, given the approximation in numbers.\n\nBut in terms of the question, gives average CMB photon energy as 10^-3eV, so insert alternative powers:\n\nPerhaps check once again: 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV. Squaring that gives (511,000)^2 = 261,121,000,000 eV². Dividing by ε = 1e-3 eV gives 261,121,000,000,000 eV = 2.61121e14 eV. Which is approximately 261 TeV.\n\nSince 1 TeV=1e12 eV, 1e14 eV is 100 TeV. Therefore, 2.6e14 eV is 260 TeV.\n\nThus, logically, after all calculations deliberated, the answer is approximately 260 TeV, in the hundreds of TeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy at which gamma-ray lifetimes are limited by this process is \\boxed{1 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{eV}}.\n\n**Note:** *Upon re-evaluating the precise calculation, the threshold energy is approximately \\(261 \\, \\text{TeV}\\), which converts to \\(2.61 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{eV}\\). However, given common approximations in such contexts, the answer might be rounded to \\(1 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{eV}\\). To ensure accuracy, using the precise value \\(261 \\, \\text{TeV}\\) or \\(2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{eV}\\) would be more correct.

To determine the energy at which gamma-rays' lifetimes are limited by the annihilation process with CMB photons (γγ → e⁺e⁻), we need to consider the energy threshold required for pair production. The rest mass energy of an electron-positron pair is 1.022 MeV (2 × 0.511 MeV). 

The key steps involve calculating the invariant energy squared (s) in the center-of-momentum (CM) frame for the collision between a high-energy gamma-ray and a CMB photon. The threshold condition is given by:

\[
s = (2m_e c^2)^2
\]

where \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}\). The invariant s for two photons colliding head-on is:

\[
s = 4 E_\gamma \varepsilon
\]

Here, \(E_\gamma\) is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and \(\varepsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}\) is the average energy of a CMB photon. Setting the threshold condition:

\[
4 E_\gamma \varepsilon = (2m_e c^2)^2
\]

Solving for \(E_\gamma\):

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\varepsilon} = \frac{(0.511 \, \text{MeV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
\]

Converting units:

\[
0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV}
\]

\[
E_\gamma = \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{261,121,000,000 \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 261,121,000,000,000 \, \text{eV} = 261 \, \text{TeV} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy at which gamma-ray lifetimes are limited by this process is:

\[
\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}
\]

*500*11 = 11,000  
Thus, (500 + 11)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*11 + 11^2 = 250,000 + 11,000 + 121 = 261,121. Therefore,

261,121 * 10^6 (eV^2). Then,

Divide by ε = 1e-3 eV: 261,121 * 10^6 / 1e-3 = 261,121 * 10^9 eV = 261,121 GeV = 261.121 TeV

Yes, so E_γ = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^-3 eV) ≈ 261 TeV.

Wait a minute, that’s the conclusion? But literature suggests that the threshold for pair production against CMB photons is TeV energies. Wait, if the typical result for pair production is particles like high-energy gamma-rays in the hundreds of TeV range become attenuated by the CMB. But here, ε = 1e-3 eV, so how do students usually approach this?

Alternatively, perhaps errors surface in the collision kinematics. Suppose that when a high-energy gamma-ray undergoes pair production with a CMB photon, we approach this by considering the rest frame of the system? Wait, regardless, how comes:

Gotten 261 TeV as calculated here.

Is there a step misapplied?

Wait, the average energy of CMB is like 1e-3 eV but with peak energy. Let’s recall perhaps reshifting through temperature. CMB has a temperature of about 2.7 K. The average photon energy for a Planck distribution is approximately 2.7 k_B T. However, the average photon energy in CMB is approximately around 0.001 eV (which makes sense because T is ≈2.7 K → in eV, k_B T ≈ (8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K) * 2.7 K ≈ 2.3 × 10^-4 eV, which might imply that the average energy is ~ (roughly 0.00023 eV). But in the question, it states the average photon energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV, a bit higher. Though maybe that could be a typo, but per the question itself, we have to go with 10^-3 eV.

Moving on. Regardless, with values approximately 10^-3 eV. So me c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV, then (511,000)^2 / (1e-3) eV:

Again, 511,000 eV times 511,000 eV / 1e-3 eV = (511,000)^2 / 1e-3. Let's handle 511,000^2: as above it's 261,121,000,000 eV². Thus, when you divide by 1e-3 eV, that's 261,121,000,000 / 0.001 eV = 261,121,000,000,000 eV = 261,121 TeV.

Wait, the exponent here is 0.511 MeV, and calculations give 261,121 TeV. But 1 TeV is 10^12 eV. Therefore, 261,000 TeV would be 2.61e+14 eV. However, when converting the equation:

me c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 10^6 eV  
(me c^2)^2 = (0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 = 0.261 × 10^12 eV²

Divide this by ε = 1e-3 eV,

So E_γ = (0.261 × 10^12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 0.261 × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV = 261 TeV.

Yes, indeed, that’s confirmation and hence 261 TeV, which is approximately 300 TeV, potentially rounding.

Moreover, this appears to be in line with the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, though the GZK limit deals with protons interacting with CMB photons at ~1e20 eV, leading to pion production because the threshold is lower (p + γ → pion), though different process entirely. Therefore, analysts conclude for photon-photon pair production, the threshold is indeed hundreds of TeV. However, this may depend on which photon background we're referring to.

The point is, this calculation shows that in order for a gamma-ray to annihilate with a CMB photon (assuming 1e-3 eV) to make an electron-positron pair, the gamma-ray must have energy on the order of hundreds of TeV. Hence, above that energy, the gamma-rays interact with the CMB such that their mean free path becomes limited, leading to degradation via pair production, hence the lifetime in the universe is restricted. Hence, the answer is E_γ ≈ (me c^2)^2 / ε = ~261 TeV.

But as I double-check, Oh! Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the invariant s initial calculation—whether it includes the angle between photons. Unless we consider head-on collisions, the photon momenta vectors could collide at some angle. The worst case is when photons approach head-on. For maximum possible interaction, the angle is 180 degrees.

The formula 4 E1 E2 / (1 - cos θ) >= (2 me c^2)^2. At the threshold, when considering the minimum energy required, the maximum energy threshold occurs when photons are head-on, as then it's minimized. Actually, that expression:

The general condition involves the angle θ between the two photon directions. The invariant s is given by:

s = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cos θ)

But if they're moving the same direction, θ =0, so s would tend to 0. For opposite directions, θ = π, so 1 - cos θ = 2, which gives maximum s.

Wait! Therefore, previous derivation the maximum s=s_max=4ε E_γ.

So, head-on collisions produce the largest possible s, which are best able to reach the threshold for pair production. Under lower angles, lower s for same E1 and E2.

So specifically, if the gamma-ray has Energy E_γ and the CMB photon has E_CMB=ε=1e-3 eV, then maximum s is s=4 E_γ ε. To produce an e+ e- pair requires s = (2 me c^2)^2. Thus, when s = (2 me c^2)^2:

4 E_γ ε >= (2 me c^2)^2  
Therefore,

E_γ >= ( (2 me c^2)^2 ) / (4 ε ) = (me c^2)^2 / Epsilon

Thus, precisely correct,

E_γ ≈ ( (0.511 MeV )^2 ) / 1e-3 eV.

That's accurate. Plugging in the numbers:

(0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.261e12 eV^2 ) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 eV * (1 TeV /1e12 eV) )= 261 TeV

Wait, yes. That computation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be ~300 TeV, so around 261.1 TeV. So, gamma-rays with energies above ~260 TeV would interact with the CMB photons via pair production, hence this would limit their mean free path in the universe.

Therefore, the universe is opaque to gamma-rays above approximately 260 TeV due to pair-production on the CMB. Therefore, the critical energy is this value. Consequently, gamma-rays with energies ≳ 10^14 eV = 100 TeV are mostly absorbed; however, precise calculation here gives 261 TeV as the threshold.

Perhaps quoting with two significant figures: 2.6 × 10^14 eV, which is 260 TeV.

Therefore, summarizing: the process γγ → e+e- has a threshold energy dependent on the product of the two photons' energies. For a CMB photon with ~10^-3 eV, the high-energy photon's energy must be such that their combined invariant mass reaches at least the electron-positron rest mass. Numerically, we have ~ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ≈ 261 TeV, above which gamma-rays annihilate effectively with CMB photons, thus their lifespan or propagation distance in the universe gets limited.

In extraterrestrial gamma-ray astrophysics, this effect is part of why we observe a drop-off (cutoff) in the gamma-ray spectrum at ultra-high energies since gamma-rays from distant sources annihilate with the pervasive CMB—forming electron-positron pairs—reducing their flux. Therefore, the answer being around hundreds of TeVs, as provided.

Thus, converting 261 TeV to proper units, TeV vs eV:

261 TeV = 261,000 GeV = 261,000 x 10^9 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV. So written as 2.6 x10^14 eV, given the approximation in numbers.

But in terms of the question, gives average CMB photon energy as 10^-3eV, so insert alternative powers:

Perhaps check once again: 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV. Squaring that gives (511,000)^2 = 261,121,000,000 eV². Dividing by ε = 1e-3 eV gives 261,121,000,000,000 eV = 2.61121e14 eV. Which is approximately 261 TeV.

Since 1 TeV=1e12 eV, 1e14 eV is 100 TeV. Therefore, 2.6e14 eV is 260 TeV.

Thus, logically, after all calculations deliberated, the answer is approximately 260 TeV, in the hundreds of TeV.

**Final Answer**
The energy at which gamma-ray lifetimes are limited by this process is \boxed{1 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}.

**Note:** *Upon re-evaluating the precise calculation, the threshold energy is approximately \(261 \, \text{TeV}\), which converts to \(2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}\). However, given common approximations in such contexts, the answer might be rounded to \(1 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}\). To ensure accuracy, using the precise value \(261 \, \text{TeV}\) or \(2.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}\) would be more correct. The discrepancy here suggests a possible error in the final boxed answer. Recalculating, the precise answer should be \(\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}\) or \(\boxed{261 \, \text{TeV}}\). Nevertheless, due to the problem stating the average CMB photon energy as \(10^{-3} \, \text{eV}\), the exact answer based on precise computation is \(\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}\)*. Considering the significance of the result in the original problem statement and common conventions, the exact boxed answer here should adhere to the detailed calculation result.

Final decision: Although the precise calculation yields approximately 261 TeV (2.6 x10^14 eV), sometimes in literature, the value is rounded to 10^14 eV (100 TeV), but strictly according to math, it's 2.6e14 eV or 260 TeV. Therefore, the answer, after verification, are best presented as \boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}.
