# Original Question

You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

The formation of shmoo in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* induced by a quorum-sensing peptide suggests activation of pathways similar to the mating pheromone response. This process involves transcriptional activation of mating-specific genes, leading to polarized growth and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) targeting active chromatin would enrich for proteins associated with transcriptional activation, such as RNA polymerase II, Mediator complex, chromatin remodelers (e.g., SWI/SNF), and histone acetyltransferases (e.g., SAGA). 

Key considerations for the least observed complex:
1. **Repressive complexes** like histone deacetylases (e.g., Rpd3) are unlikely to be present in active chromatin regions, as these regions are marked by histone acetylation (not deacetylation).
2. **Origin Recognition Complex (ORC)** is primarily involved in DNA replication initiation at replication origins. During G1 arrest (as in shmoo formation), replication is inactive. While ORC binds replication origins throughout the cell cycle, these regions may not overlap with transcriptionally active chromatin in this context. 

**Conclusion**: The least observed proteins would come from the **Origin Recognition Complex (ORC)**, as its role in replication is unrelated to the transcriptionally active chromatin regions isolated during shmoo formation. Repressive complexes like Rpd3 are also unlikely, but ORC is more distinct in its functional segregation from transcriptional activation in this scenario.

**Answer**: Origin Recognition Complex (ORC).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a new quorum-sensing peptide from Lactobacillus acidophilus and its effect on yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). When they treat the yeast with this peptide, they observe the formation of shmoos. Then they did chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to look at the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo. The question is asking which complex's proteins would be least likely to be observed in the assay. The answer choices aren't listed here, but maybe I can figure out the options based on common complexes involved in chromatin and transcription.

First, let's recall what a shmoo is. In yeast, shmooing is a response to mating pheromones. When yeast cells of different mating types (a and Î±) detect each other's pheromones, they undergo a morphological change to form a shmoo, which is a projection towards the source of the pheromone, enabling conjugation. The formation of shmoo involves changes in gene expression, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and polarized growth.

Now, since the quorum-sensing peptide is inducing shmoo formation, it's likely activating similar pathways as the mating pheromone response. The mating pheromone in yeast activates a MAP kinase pathway, leading to changes in gene expression via transcription factors like Ste12. Active chromatin regions would be those where transcription is happening, so the immunoprecipitation is probably targeting either transcription factors, components of the transcription machinery, or histone modifications associated with active transcription (like H3K4me3).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is used to pull down DNA along with the proteins bound to it. If they're looking at active chromatin, they might be using an antibody against RNA polymerase II, a histone modification marker for active transcription, or perhaps a specific transcription factor that's active during shmoo formation. The mass spec would then identify proteins associated with those regions.

So, the complex proteins they would find could be part of the RNA polymerase II complex, Mediator complex, chromatin remodeling complexes, etc. The question is which complex would be least observed. If a complex is not involved in active transcription during shmoo formation, or if it's involved in repressing transcription, it might be absent.

Possible complexes to consider are:
1. RNA Polymerase II
2. Mediator complex
3. Histone acetyltransferase complexes (like SAGA)
4. SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex
5. Histone deacetylase complexes (like Rpd3 or Hda1)
6. Condensin or cohesin complexes (involved in chromosome structure)
7. The origin recognition complex (ORC) involved in DNA replication

Now, active chromatin is usually associated with open chromatin, acetylation (HATs), Mediator complex facilitating RNA Pol II interaction, SWI/SNF remodeling for accessibility. Repressive complexes like HDACs or Polycomb would be less associated with active regions. However, yeast doesn't have Polycomb; repressive mechanisms include HDACs, Sir proteins (involved in silencing).

But the assay is for active chromatin. So the proteins from repressive complexes wouldn't be there. So the least likely would be a repressive complex. For yeast, the Rpd3 complex is a histone deacetylase involved in transcriptional repression. So if they're isolating active chromatin, Rpd3 complex proteins might not be there. Similarly, the origin recognition complex is involved in replication origins; active transcription might not correlate with ORC. But replication occurs during S phase, while shmoo formation is part of the mating process, perhaps during G1 phase. So ORC might be less involved here.

Alternatively, maybe condensin or cohesin, which are involved in chromosome segregation during mitosis or meiosis. Since shmoo formation is part of the mating process leading to meiosis after conjugation, but maybe in the shmoo phase, the cells are not undergoing mitosis, so condensin/cohesin not active.

Another angle: during the mating pheromone response, Ste12 is activated, which induces genes involved in mating. So active chromatin areas would have Ste12, RNA Pol II, Mediator, chromatin remodelers. Repressive complexes would be less likely. So the answer might relate to a repressive complex. If the choices were between Mediator, SWI/SNF, SAGA, and Histone deacetylase (like Rpd3), then HDACs would be least observed. If the options include the origin replication complex, that might depend on whether replication is occurring. However, during shmoo formation (G1 phase), ORC might be present but inactive. Alternatively, maybe the 19S proteasome, but that's not a chromatin complex. Or the tRNA synthetases? Unlikely. Another possibility: the NuA4 HAT complex would be present, but HDACs absent.

The question is from a multiple-choice, so I need to think which complex is not involved in active chromatin. The answer is probably a complex involved in transcriptional repression or chromatin condensation. In yeast, the Rpd3 complex and the Sir complex are involved in silencing. ORC might be associated with origins but not directly with active transcription. Alternatively, the Cohesin complex may not be involved.

Wait, condensin and cohesin are more about chromosome structure. Cohesin holds sister chromatids together; condensin condenses chromosomes during mitosis. If the cells are in G1 and not dividing, cohesin/condensin might not be active on chromatin.

Alternatively, the nuclear pore complex could be involved in export, but perhaps not in active chromatin regions. But nuclear pore components sometimes associate with active genes... Maybe not.

In the yeast mating pathway, they arrest in G1 phase, so replication hasn't started. Therefore, origin recognition complex (ORC) might not be active. But maybe it's still present, since ORC binds origins throughout the cell cycle.

Alternatively, maybe the RNA Polymerase I complex, which is involved in rRNA transcription in the nucleolus, which is a different region. But the question is about the active chromatin in the shmoo, which is part of the cell's transcriptional response to mating, probably RNA Pol II genes.

Therefore, the least likely would be proteins from a repressive complex like Rpd3 or Sir. Alternatively, if the choices include the ORC, that might be it. Since the user mentioned "the least of proteins from which complex," the answer is probably the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), because active transcription regions (active chromatin) are not the same as replication origins, and in G1 phase, ORC may not be active at those regions. So, ORC proteins would be least observed. Alternatively, the Cohesin complex.

But when I think of active chromatin, origins of replication are often in open chromatin regions. However, ORC is involved in replication, not transcription. So perhaps ORC would not be found in active chromatin regions pulled down by a transcription-related ChIP. Alternatively, perhaps the heterochromatin complexes like Sir proteins.

Since the question is from a standardized test or similar, common complexes tested in such contexts are ORC, Mediator, SWI/SNF, RNA Pol II, and HDACs. The one not involved would be origin recognition complex. Alternatively, repressive complexes. If the immunoprecipitation is for active chromatin marks, like H3K4me3 or acetylated histones, then repressive complexes would be absent. HDACs are involved in deacetylation, so they would not be in active chromatin. So, proteins from the Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex would be least observed. So, of the given complexes, HDAC-containing complexes (like Rpd3) would be least observed.

So putting this all together, depending on the options, the answer is either ORC or Histone Deacetylase complex. But I need to think which is more likely. The question says "proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation." If they are doing ChIP for active chromatin, they might be using an antibody against a protein that's part of active transcription. For example, if they used an antibody against a transcription factor like Ste12, or against RNA Pol II, or an active histone mark. Suppose they used H3K4me3 or H3 acetylation antibody, then the proteins co-purified would be those associated with active promoters or enhancers. The Mediator complex interacts with RNA Pol II and transcription factors. SWI/SNF is a chromatin remodeler that facilitates accessibility. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) like SAGA or NuA4 would be present. Proteins involved in repression, like HDACs or Sir proteins, would not be there. So the least observed complex would be one involved in repression. If the options included Rpd3 complex (HDAC), then that's the answer. Other options like origin recognition complex might not be directly linked unless replication is happening, which it is not during shmoo formation. ORC is typically at replication origins, which are in open chromatin too, but in G1 phase replication hasn't started. But ORC might still be bound. Still, perhaps their presence in active chromatin regions isn't as much as the transcriptional machinery.

Alternatively, the Cohesin complex is involved in holding sister chromatids together, but during G1 phase, there's no sister chromatids. So cohesin may not be present in those regions. Maybe. But in yeast, cohesin is also involved in transcriptional regulation, like in chromosome looping, so it might be present. 

Considering that the answer choices might offer Origin Recognition Complex, Mediator, SWI/SNF, and Rpd3. So Mediator and SWI/SNF would be present, Rpd3 would be absent, and ORC might be absent. Which is least observed?

Alternatively, another angle: when cells are forming shmoos, they arrest in G1 phase. The cell cycle arrest is part of the pheromone response. So DNA replication complexes (like ORC) are inactive. However, ORC proteins themselves are still present but perhaps not active. So they might not be associated with active chromatin regions. Whereas, Mediator and the rest are involved in transcription. So the ORC would be least observed.

So, if the options are Mediator, SWI/SNF, ORC, and Histone deacetylase, then the answer is ORC? Or Histone deacetylase.

At this point, I think the most likely answer is the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), because it is involved in DNA replication, not in active transcription during shmoo formation. However, if histone deacetylases like Rpd3 are an option, that would be another possibility.

But given how the question is phrased, which complexes are part of active chromatin. HDACs remove acetyl groups, so they wouldn't be present in active chromatin regions. So maybe HDAC complex is the answer. The confusion is whether active chromatin regions would have HDACs. Typically, HDACs are involved in deacetylation leading to chromatin condensation and gene silencing. Active chromatin is marked by acetylation, so HATs are present, HDACs are not. So in the active chromatin regions pulled down, HDAC-containing complexes would be the least observed.

So if the choices are:
A) Mediator complex
B) SWI/SNF complex
C) Origin Recognition Complex
D) Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex

Then D would be the answer. But maybe the answer is the origin recognition complex. For example, if I recall some experiments, ORC is found at replication origins, which are often in open chromatin, so during G1, these regions might still have ORC bound, even if not active. However, if you're looking at active chromatin (transcriptionally active), ORC might not be there. But I'm not 100% sure.

Another angle: the shmoo formation involves activation of mating-specific genes. These genes would have their promoters in active chromatin. The mediator complex, SWI/SNF, RNA Pol II, and HATs would be present. The ORC is probably not at the promoters of these genes, but rather at replication origins. Therefore, ORC proteins would not be detected. Similarly, Rpd3 would not be present. But which is the least? Maybe both, but among answer choices, which is the more canonical answer.

In chromatin immunoprecipitation of active chromatin, HDACs would not be there, whereas ORC also not. But origin recognition complex's presence might depend. For the purpose of exams, HDACs would be an expected answer.

But, another possibility: maybe the question is referring to heterochromatin protein complexes. However, the answer options probably list specific complexes.

Alternatively, think about which complex is not involved in transcription at all. Origin Recognition Complex is for replication. So ChIP for active chromatin (transcriptionally active regions) would pull down transcription complexes. Replication complexes would not be there. Therefore, ORC proteins would be least observed. If that's the case, then ORC.

Well, given that after the mating pheromone response, cells are in G1 arrest, which is before the S phase. The origin recognition complexes in G1 might be bound to origins but not active. But are ORC proteins present at origins even in G1? Yes, ORC binds to replication origins throughout the cell cycle. The binding of ORC is actually a marker for replication origins. However, origins of replication in yeast tend to be in open chromatin regions. But active transcription might not be happening there.

Wait, active chromatin regions (being open) may overlap with replication origins. However, the question is about the proteome of the active chromatin, so the proteins that are bound there. So replication proteins like ORC might coexist. But if the ChIP is performed to pull down regions of active transcription (like promoters of induced genes), which are marked by H3K4me3, acetylation, etc., those regions might not be replication origins. Thus, ORC would not be present in those regions. Whereas Mediator, RNA Pol II, etc., would be. So in that case, ORC would be the least observed complex.

Alternatively, HDAC might be present at low levels. But since acetylated histones are marks of active chromatin, HDAC's presence would counteract that, so they wouldn't be there. So HDAC proteins would not be present in active chromatin regions. So perhaps Rpd3 complex proteins would be least observed.

Overall, given that the question is from a standard biology test, I think the answer is the Origin Recognition Complex. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the Rpd3 complex. I need to pick the most likely answer based on the reasoning.

Another way: During the mating response in yeast, the cells undergo changes in gene expression, activating genes involved in mating. The active chromatin would include the promoters and coding regions of these genes. The origin recognition complex is primarily involved in DNA replication initiation. Replication occurs during S phase, which doesn't happen during G1 arrest caused by mating pheromone. Therefore, ORC-bound regions would not be associated with active transcription in this context because they're not in S phase. Hence, ORC proteins would not be found in the active chromatin regions isolated during shmoo formation. However, Mediator, SWI/SNF, RNA Pol II, and even HATs would be present. So, the Origin Recognition Complex would be least observed.

Therefore, the answer is the Origin Recognition Complex.

Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a new quorum-sensing peptide from Lactobacillus acidophilus and its effect on yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). When they treat the yeast with this peptide, they observe the formation of shmoos. Then they did chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to look at the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo. The question is asking which complex's proteins would be least likely to be observed in the assay. The answer choices aren't listed here, but maybe I can figure out the options based on common complexes involved in chromatin and transcription.

First, let's recall what a shmoo is. In yeast, shmooing is a response to mating pheromones. When yeast cells of different mating types (a and Î±) detect each other's pheromones, they undergo a morphological change to form a shmoo, which is a projection towards the source of the pheromone, enabling conjugation. The formation of shmoo involves changes in gene expression, cytoskeleton rearrangement, and polarized growth.

Now, since the quorum-sensing peptide is inducing shmoo formation, it's likely activating similar pathways as the mating pheromone response. The mating pheromone in yeast activates a MAP kinase pathway, leading to changes in gene expression via transcription factors like Ste12. Active chromatin regions would be those where transcription is happening, so the immunoprecipitation is probably targeting either transcription factors, components of the transcription machinery, or histone modifications associated with active transcription (like H3K4me3).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is used to pull down DNA along with the proteins bound to it. If they're looking at active chromatin, they might be using an antibody against RNA polymerase II, a histone modification marker for active transcription, or perhaps a specific transcription factor that's active during shmoo formation. The mass spec would then identify proteins associated with those regions.

So, the complex proteins they would find could be part of the RNA polymerase II complex, Mediator complex, chromatin remodeling complexes, etc. The question is which complex would be least observed. If a complex is not involved in active transcription during shmoo formation, or if it's involved in repressing transcription, it might be absent.

Possible complexes to consider are:
1. RNA Polymerase II
2. Mediator complex
3. Histone acetyltransferase complexes (like SAGA)
4. SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex
5. Histone deacetylase complexes (like Rpd3 or Hda1)
6. Condensin or cohesin complexes (involved in chromosome structure)
7. The origin recognition complex (ORC) involved in DNA replication

Now, active chromatin is usually associated with open chromatin, acetylation (HATs), Mediator complex facilitating RNA Pol II interaction, SWI/SNF remodeling for accessibility. Repressive complexes like HDACs or Polycomb would be less associated with active regions. However, yeast doesn't have Polycomb; repressive mechanisms include HDACs, Sir proteins (involved in silencing).

But the assay is for active chromatin. So the proteins from repressive complexes wouldn't be there. So the least likely would be a repressive complex. For yeast, the Rpd3 complex is a histone deacetylase involved in transcriptional repression. So if they're isolating active chromatin, Rpd3 complex proteins might not be there. Similarly, the origin recognition complex is involved in replication origins; active transcription might not correlate with ORC. But replication occurs during S phase, while shmoo formation is part of the mating process, perhaps during G1 phase. So ORC might be less involved here.

Alternatively, maybe condensin or cohesin, which are involved in chromosome segregation during mitosis or meiosis.

# Anthropic completion

I'll explore this problem concerning a quorum-sensing peptide from Lactobacillus acidophilus and its impact on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When yeast is exposed to this peptide, shmoo formation occurs. The researchers conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to analyze the active chromatin proteome in the shmoo. The question asks which protein complex would be least likely detected in this assay.

Let me consider what shmoos are. In yeast, shmoos develop as a response to mating pheromones. When yeast cells of opposite mating types (a and Î±) detect each other's pheromones, they undergo morphological transformation, creating a projection toward the pheromone source to facilitate conjugation. This process involves gene expression changes, cytoskeletal reorganization, and directional growth.

Since the quorum-sensing peptide triggers shmoo formation, it likely activates pathways similar to the mating pheromone response. Yeast mating pheromones activate a MAP kinase pathway, altering gene expression through transcription factors such as Ste12. Active chromatin regions correspond to transcription sites, so the immunoprecipitation likely targets transcription factors, transcription machinery components, or active transcription-associated histone modifications like H3K4me3.

ChIP technique pulls down DNA with its bound proteins. For active chromatin analysis, researchers might use antibodies against RNA polymerase II, active transcription histone markers, or specific transcription factors activated during shmoo formation. Mass spectrometry then identifies the proteins in these regions.

Expected protein complexes might include RNA polymerase II complex, Mediator complex, chromatin remodeling complexes, and others. The question asks which complex would be least observed. Complexes uninvolved in shmoo formation-related transcription or those suppressing transcription might be absent.

Candidate complexes include:
1. RNA Polymerase II
2. Mediator complex
3. Histone acetyltransferase complexes (SAGA)
4. SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex
5. Histone deacetylase complexes (Rpd3/Hda1)
6. Condensin/cohesin complexes (chromosome structure)
7. Origin recognition complex (DNA replication)

Active chromatin typically features open structure, acetylation (HATs), Mediator facilitating RNA Pol II interaction, and SWI/SNF enabling accessibility. Repressive complexes like HDACs would be less associated with active regions. Yeast lacks Polycomb; its repressive mechanisms include HDACs and Sir proteins.

Since the assay targets active chromatin, repressive complex proteins would likely be absent. The Rpd3 complex, a histone deacetylase involved in transcriptional repression, might not appear. Similarly, the origin recognition complex relates to replication origins, which might not correlate with active transcription. Furthermore, replication occurs during S phase, while shmoo formation relates to mating, possibly during G1 phase, making ORC less relevant.

Alternatively, condensin or cohesin, involved in chromosome segregation during mitosis or meiosis, might also be unlikely candidates.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I'll try to tackle this problem. The question revolves around a newly identified quorum-sensing peptide from Lactobacillus acidophilus and its impact on yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). When this peptide is introduced to the yeast, there's a notable formation of shmoos. They conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to analyze the active chromatin proteome in the shmoo. The task is to determine which protein complex would be least likely apparent in this assay. Although the answer choices aren't included, I can infer the possibilities based on typical complexes associated with chromatin and transcription.

To begin, let's understand what a shmoo entails. In yeast, shmooing is a reaction to mating pheromones. When yeast cells of opposite mating types (a and Î±) sense pheromones from each other, they undergo a morphological alteration to create a shmoo, a projection pointing towards the pheromone's source, facilitating conjugation. This process involves gene expression changes, cytoskeleton reorganization, and directed growth.

Since the quorum-sensing peptide prompts shmoo formation, it likely triggers pathways akin to those in the mating pheromone response. The mating pheromone in yeast activates a MAP kinase pathway, resulting in altered gene expression through transcription factors like Ste12. Consequently, active chromatin regions are likely where this transcription occurs, indicating that the immunoprecipitation may target transcription factors, elements of the transcription machinery, or histone modifications linked with active transcription (such as H3K4me3).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is applied to extract DNA with its bound proteins. If they are examining active chromatin, they might use an antibody against RNA polymerase II, a histone modification marker for transcriptional activity, or a transcription factor specific to shmoo formation. The mass spectrometry would then identify proteins associated with those regions.

Thus, the proteins identified could belong to the RNA polymerase II complex, the Mediator complex, chromatin remodeling complexes, etc. The question centers on which complex would be least observed. If a complex isn't involved in active transcription during shmoo formation or if it represses transcription, it might be absent.

Some possible complexes to assess are:
1. RNA Polymerase II
2. Mediator complex
3. Histone acetyltransferase complexes (like SAGA)
4. SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex
5. Histone deacetylase complexes (like Rpd3 or Hda1)
6. Condensin or cohesin complexes (linked to chromosome structure)
7. The origin recognition complex (ORC) related to DNA replication

Active chromatin is typically linked to open chromatin, acetylation (HATs), Mediator complex aiding RNA Pol II interaction, and SWI/SNF remodeling for accessibility. Repressive complexes like HDACs or Polycomb are less involved with active regions. While yeast doesn't contain Polycomb, repressive mechanisms involve HDACs and Sir proteins for silencing.

Yet, the focus is on active chromatin. Thus, proteins from repressive complexes would likely be absent. Consequently, the least likely complex to appear would be a repressive one. In yeast, the Rpd3 complex serves as a histone deacetylase in transcriptional repression. Hence, if they're analyzing active chromatin, Rpd3 complex proteins might be absent. Similarly, the origin recognition complex pertains to replication origins; active transcription may not align with ORC. However, replication occurs during S phase, while shmoo formation happens during mating in perhaps the G1 phase. Thus, ORC involvement might be minimal here.

Additionally, it could be condensin or cohesin, both of which participate in chromosome segregation during mitosis or meiosis.

However, ORC binding is typically in the G1 phase as part of the pre-replicative complex, so in G1 arrested cells (like during shmoo), ORC might be bound.

ORC is at replication origins, which might not overlap with active genes. Yeast origin of replications are in intergenic regions.

Therefore, proteins from the origin recognition complex (ORC) would be least likely observed.\n\nBut let me make sure. In S. cerevisiae, active transcription tends to occur in regions away from the origin of replication. Origins are in intergenic regions and generally, transcriptionally active regions might be farther from origins. Therefore, the ORC proteins would not be associated with active chromatin.\n\nAnother angle: the mating pheromone response leads to activation of genes such as FUS1, FUS3, etc. The transcription factors like Ste12 would bind to promoters.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) targeting active chromatin would enrich for proteins associated with transcriptional activation, such as RNA polymerase II, Mediator complex components, histone acetyltransferases (e.g., SAGA), and chromatin remodelers (e.g., SWI/SNF).

- **Active Chromatin Complexes:** Mediator, RNA Pol II, SAGA, and SWI/SNF are integral to active transcription and would likely be detected.
- **Repressive or Non-Transcriptional Complexes:** 
  - **Histone deacetylases (HDACs, e.g., Rpd3)** are linked to transcriptional repression and would be underrepresented.
  - **Origin Recognition Complex (ORC)** is associated with DNA replication origins and licensing in G1, but not transcriptionally active regions.
  - **Condensin/Cohesin** complexes are involved in chromosome segregation during mitosis/meiosis, not active transcription in G1-arrested shmoo cells.

**Conclusion:** The **Origin Recognition Complex (ORC)** is least likely to be observed in the proteome of active chromatin during shmoo formation, as it primarily functions in DNA replication rather than transcriptional activation. 

**Answer:** The least observed proteins would belong to the **Origin Recognition Complex (ORC)**.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 But shmoo formation is more about preparing for mating (which is a type of sexual reproduction involving meiosis), so maybe not in active chromatin for transcription?

Or the SAGA complex (a HAT complex) would be present, so that's active. The Mediator complex is definitely involved in active transcription. RNA Pol II as well.

If the question lists ORC, condensin, Rpd3, or other repressive complexes, then those would be the least observed. Since the answer options weren't given, but the original question in the user's mind probably has specific choices.

Wait, the way the user phrased the question is: "the least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?" So, the answer would be the complex that's not involved in active chromatin. If the choices were, for example, Mediator, RNA Pol II, SAGA, and Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), then ORC would be least, as ORC is part of DNA replication origins.

Alternatively, another possibility is the Tup1-Cyc8 complex, which is a transcriptional repressor in yeast. If the chromatin is active, repressors would not be there.

But since the user hasn't given the options, I need to infer based on standard complexes.

But in typical ChIP assays for active chromatin, Mediator, RNA Pol II, histone acetyltransferases, and chromatin remodelers would be present. On the flip side, complexes involved in repression (like HDACs, Tup1-Cyc8) or DNA replication (ORC) or chromosome condensation (condensin, cohesin during mitosis) would be less likely.

Shmoo formation is part of the mating response, which involves cell cycle arrest in G1 phase (to prepare for mating). In G1 phase, DNA replication hasn't started yet, so ORC might be present but perhaps not active; most active replication is in S phase. So ORC proteins might not be heavily associated with active transcription in G1.

Alternatively, if the active chromatin regions include origins of replication that are licensed (with ORC proteins), maybe ORC would be there. However, ORC binding is typically in the G1 phase as part of the pre-replicative complex, so in G1 arrested cells (like during shmoo), ORC might be bound. However, ORC isn't directly involved in transcription. So whether ORC would be present in the active chromatin being transcribed?

Probably not. The active chromatin proteins would be those involved in transcription, not replication. So the least observed complex might be ORC.

Alternatively, the condensin complex is involved in chromosome condensation during mitosis, which is not happening in shmooing cells (as they are in G1 arrest). So that complex's proteins wouldn't be present.

But the question is about active chromatin. So for ChIP, if they used an antibody against active histone marks, then any proteins co-purified would be those bound to active genes. Repressive complexes, condensin, ORC might not be there. ORC is at replication origins, which might not overlap with active genes. Yeast origin of replications are in intergenic regions. But when the cell is in G1, ORC is bound, but if the active chromatin is at promoters of genes being transcribed, ORC complexes would not be in those regions. Therefore, proteins from the origin recognition complex (ORC) would be least likely observed.

But let me make sure. In S. cerevisiae, active transcription tends to occur in regions away from the origin of replication. Origins are in intergenic regions and generally, transcriptionally active regions might be farther from origins. Therefore, the ORC proteins would not be associated with active chromatin.

Another angle: the mating pheromone response leads to activation of genes such as FUS1, FUS3, etc. The transcription factors like Ste12 would bind to promoters. The Mediator complex, RNA Pol II, chromatin remodelers like SWI/SNF, and SAGA would all be present. Repressors like Tup1-Cyc8 might be absent if the genes they repress are not active here.

So if the options include ORC, Condensin, HDAC complex (e.g., Rpd3), versus Mediator, RNA Pol II, SAGA, SWI/SNF.

So the least observed would be ORC, condensin, or HDAC. ORC is for replication, condensin for chromosome structure, HDAC for deacetylation (which is repression). In an active chromatin region, HDACs are less likely. But sometimes active genes can have cycles of acetylation and deacetylation. However, overall, HDACs are more associated with repression.

But since the answer needs to be from the possible options, which I don't have, but based on the reasoning, I think the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) is part of the DNA replication machinery, so its proteins would be least associated with active chromatin regions analyzed in this experiment. Unless the ORC in yeast has some role in transcription, but I think mainly replication.

Therefore, the answer is likely the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC). But the user hasn't given options, but the original query might have ORC as one of them. Let me check if my previous knowledge aligns: I've read that ChIP for active chromatin in yeast typically enriches for transcription factors, Mediator, RNA Pol II, chromatin remodelers, and HATs, not ORC.

Yes, ORC is usually involved in initiating DNA replication, so proteins from this complex would not be present in active chromatin regions related to gene expression induced during shmoo formation. Therefore, the least observed proteins would be from the Origin Recognition Complex.

Wait, but the S phase? Mating involves cell cycle arrest in G1 for conjugation. So origin replication complexes (ORC) would not be active here either. So ORC proteins won't be part of active chromatin during shmoo.

2. Replication (ORC), repair (e.g., MRN), repression (HDACs), sister chromatid cohesion (cohesin), condensation (condensin), etc.

Since chromatin immunoprecipitation of ACTIVE chromatin would pull regions where transcription is active. Proteins found in that would be the transcription machinery.

So ORC, being replication, shouldn't be in active transcription chromatin regions. Hence, in the setup, ORC would be the least observed.

User probably needs to recognize that replication-initiation complexes are not part of active transcription (unless at S phase, but during shmoo, which is G1 phase, so replication is off).

Yes, so the answer would be ORC, which is the origin recognition complex. That would be the least observed in active chromatin during shmoo formation.

If HDACs, then in active chromatin removal of acetyl groups by HDACs is mostly associated with repression, so HDACs complexes would be in inactive chromatin. Therefore, their presence in active chromatin would be minimal.\n\nAssuming the given options are Mediator complex, RNA Pol II, SAGA complex, Cohesin, and Rpd3, the answer is Rpd3.

Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) are perhaps silent, therefore ORC would be underrepresented. Alternatively, ORC may not be a part of active chromatin regions. \n\nAlternatively, another possibility: the Arp2/3 complex involved in actin polymerization for shmoo formation. But that\'s not a chromatin-associated complex. The immunoprecipitation is of chromatin, so membrane-associated actin modifiers, while involved, wouldn\'t be part of the chromatin proteome. So right, maybe Arp2/3 isn\'t on chromatin. But the question is about complexes detected from active chromatin. Therefore, proteins directly bound to DNA regulating transcription. So actin-related proteins might not be presence. But again, since the immunoprecipitation is on chromatin sheared including transcription factors, the right answer is among known complexes.\n\nAnother angle:  the shmoo formation is triggered by the peptide via the same pathway as the mating pheromone, which in yeast signals through a GPCR, activates a MAPK cascade, leading to Ste12 transcription factor activation. Activated Ste12 would recruit Mediator and RNA Pol II to target genes, along with chromatin remodelers like SWI/SNF. Histone acetyltransferases would modify chromatin structure.

So perhaps Condensin. But then again, condensin may have other roles, or maybe it\'s not necessary. Competition pertains to transcriptional activity. As for the DNA replication machineryâORC, it might bind DNA but not in the active transcription regions.\n\nSo, given those possibilities, the correct answer hinges on which complex is NOT involved in active transcription during shmoo responses. If the options are SWI/SNF (present), Mediator (present), RNA Pol II (present), Rpd3 (deacetylase, absent), and Condensin (absent).\n\nThis might be context-dependent. In the Griffin book or research, Rpd3 is known to be involved in deacetylation and not present in active regions. Alternatively, the origin recognition complex (ORC). Assuming the latter is terms aligned with "which complex is not involved in transcription," ORC being replication origin-related, so handling replication. Thus, ORC proteins absent: but the ORC may not be part of active chromatin. Yeast\'s ORC is implicated in heterochromatin formation (e.g., at silent mating loci and telomeres), so perhaps ORC- containing regions are silent chromatin, hence not active. So properly, in the active chromatin regions signatures(SAGA, Mediator), features (H3K4me3, acetylation), but in regions where ORC is, maybe replication origins or silent regions. So origin is separate. Therefore, which complex is missing in active chromatin? the origin recognition complex.\n\nAnother angle, the mating process in yeast leads to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase prior to shmooing and mating. The ORC (origin recognition complex) binds origins of replication during G1 phase to prepare for S phase, but by the time cells are mating, maybe they are in a non-replicative state, but ORC is still bound. However, ORC in combination with Sir proteins helps in silent chromatin at HML and HMR, which are yeast silent mating type loci. Since the induction of shmoo comes from activation of these genes (which were previously silent via Sir proteins), perhaps during activation those regions are cleared of ORC. Alternatively, perhaps ORC-bound regions are silent, so active chromatin would lack ORC.\n\nGiven that, ORC complex would not be found in active chromatin. Hence, among the answer options, ORC proteins would be least observed. Alternatively, cohesin. Cohesin is applied in sister chromatid cohesion during S phase and post. But in G1, cohesin\'s role? Research says cohesin is involved in chromosome structure and transcription, even in G1. Indeed, cohesin facilitates loop formation, interaction between promoters and enhancers. So involved in transcription. Hence, if cohesin is involved in active transcription, then maybe that\'s not the answer. So back to condensin.\n\nAnother possibility is something else, like the spindle pole body. However, in chromatin, such structure wouldnât. Wait, the question is looking for which Complex, i.e., answer options happen to be possible choices: Proteasome, SMC complexes (condensin, cohesin), Mediator, SWI/SNF, the lagging one could be. Since it\'s stated the least of the options provided.\n\nIn the original scenario, it\'s leastâ so between Mediator complex proteins (present), RNA polymerase II (present), SAGA (present), origin replication complex (absent), condensin (absent).\n\nThe question is pulled probably from textbook Q&A where for a similar scenario, the ORC complex is the answer. However, let\'s access standard textbooks. Is there a conventional item that is expected?\n\nIn transcriptionally active chromatin, the ORC would not be associated, as active regions are replication origins typically euchromatic, ORC may not be standard. But conflicting info. Answers others: If the yeast is in mating and G1 phase, DNA replication has not happened. ORC is involved in licensing origins but not necessarily activeness. Aso, finite attention.\n\nThe author might expect the answer to be the Origin Recognition Complex as incorrect in the active chromatin of Shmoo cells.\n\nAlternatively, the Swi/Snf: How is Swi/Snf used? Name of SWI stands for \' Sucrose nonfermenting, which is involved in remodelling chromatin structure to allow transcription, meaning their presence would be EXPECTED in active chromatin. So incorrect if they are expected.\n\nAssuming it\'s saying "which complex\'s proteins won\'t be there", and options include the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), in which case ORC is the answer. Or perhaps replication protein A (RPA), but not part of a complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Cohesin is present, Mediator present, so the least observed would be the origin replication (ORC) complex.\n\nI think the most probable answer the question is expecting is that the Origin Recognition Complex would be the least observed since the shmooing yeast cells are probably arrested in G1 phase and not in S phase where ORC is more active. However, the ORC is still bound to origin sites even in G1 for replication licensing, but maybe isn\'t part of active chromatin regions.\n\nAlternatively, the NURD complex involved in deacetylation (but not in yeast). Possibly the answer is the Rpd3 complex (histone deacetylase) being absent. But I\'m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the Î² clamp sliding complex, but that\'s for replication (PCNA), again not the answer.\n\nStill, among textbooks and examples: If the question is testing knowledge that actively transcribed genes are replicated early in S phase. Origin recognition complex (ORC) marks origins; early replicating regions are gene-rich and active. So maybe ORC is associated with active chromatin. That complicates. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ORC isn\'t, but the replication origins in yeast are enriched for active genes, but still. Alternatively, maybe the complex that\'s involved in rDNA silencing.\n\nDilemma entails insufficient data without options. Context points towards Midterm-style question.\n\nBut shmoo formation and active chromatin makes me posit that Mediator, RNA pol II, etc., are present. Those absent: condensin, ORC, etc.\n\nAlternatively, subunit of DNA Polymerase perhaps, but that\'s in replication. So in the assay targeting active chromatin during transcription, replication complexes wouldn\'t be seen.\n\nSuppose answer is ORC.\n\nHence, the final answer after hair-splitting is that origin recognition complex (ORC) proteins would be the least observed.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743848396, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2788, prompt_tokens=863, total_tokens=3651, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Alternatively, maybe condensin complex, since shmooing doesn't involve chromosome condensation (which occurs in M phase). So condensin would be more likely found in mitosis. Therefore, in G1-arrested shmoo cells, condensin is not active. Hence, condensin complex proteins would be the least observed.

Alternatively, the Mediator complex is necessary for RNA Pol II transcription, so it's in active chromatin, so presence there. The SAGA complex involved in acetylation, present. Kinases involved in signalingâmaybe the MAP kinasesâbut they might not be stably bound to chromatin.

Alternatively, the PRC2 complex (Polycomb) is not in yeast. Yeast uses different systems.

Restating, the chromatin immunoprecipitation is targeting active regions. Therefore, proteins from regions that are transcriptionally active would be present. Absent would be parts of complexes that are involved in repression (Rpd3, Sir), replication origins (ORC),s condensed chromosomes (condensin), or cohesion (cohesin), unless specific genes at cohesin-bound regions are active.

But the "least observed" of the options. The answer choices (though missing here) probably include these. For USMLE-style questions, common options include Mediator, RNA Pol II, Nucleosome remodeling (SWI/SNF), Histone acetylases (SAGA), versus Histone deacetylases (Rpd3), Cohesin, Condensin, ORC.

Therefore, the correct answer is likely condensin complex or the origin recognition complex (ORC) (if replication origins not active) or Rpd3. If HDACs, then in active chromatin removal of acetyl groups by HDACs is mostly associated with repression, so HDACs complexes would be in inactive chromatin. Therefore, their presence in active chromatin would be minimal.

Assuming the given options are Mediator complex, RNA Pol II, SAGA complex, Cohesin, and Rpd3, the answer is Rpd3. So least observed would be Rpd3 or Cohesin?

Alternatively, if the complex is involved in gene expression shutdown, which is transcription. Since the chromatin here is active, absence would be in repressors. Alternatively, DNA replication complex.

But with the available information in mind, genes induced during mating (shmoo formation) require activation, so Mediator, RNA Pol II, etc., found. Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) are perhaps silent, therefore ORC would be underrepresented. Alternatively, ORC may not be a part of active chromatin regions. 

Alternatively, another possibility: the Arp2/3 complex involved in actin polymerization for shmoo formation. But that's not a chromatin-associated complex. The immunoprecipitation is of chromatin, so membrane-associated actin modifiers, while involved, wouldn't be part of the chromatin proteome. So right, maybe Arp2/3 isn't on chromatin. But the question is about complexes detected from active chromatin. Therefore, proteins directly bound to DNA regulating transcription. So actin-related proteins might not be presence. But again, since the immunoprecipitation is on chromatin sheared including transcription factors, the right answer is among known complexes.

Another angle:  the shmoo formation is triggered by the peptide via the same pathway as the mating pheromone, which in yeast signals through a GPCR, activates a MAPK cascade, leading to Ste12 transcription factor activation. Activated Ste12 would recruit Mediator and RNA Pol II to target genes, along with chromatin remodelers like SWI/SNF. Histone acetyltransferases would modify chromatin structure. Therefore, these are detected. Among the options given, the least likely proteins would be from a complex not involved in this process.

Condensin complex is responsible for chromosome condensation during mitosis, and in the shmoo when cells are in G1, not needing chromosome condensation. So perhaps Condensin. But then again, condensin may have other roles, or maybe it's not necessary. Competition pertains to transcriptional activity. As for the DNA replication machineryâORC, it might bind DNA but not in the active transcription regions.

So, given those possibilities, the correct answer hinges on which complex is NOT involved in active transcription during shmoo responses. If the options are SWI/SNF (present), Mediator (present), RNA Pol II (present), Rpd3 (deacetylase, absent), and Condensin (absent).

This might be context-dependent. In the Griffin book or research, Rpd3 is known to be involved in deacetylation and not present in active regions. Alternatively, the origin recognition complex (ORC). Assuming the latter is terms aligned with "which complex is not involved in transcription," ORC being replication origin-related, so handling replication. Thus, ORC proteins absent: but the ORC may not be part of active chromatin. Yeast's ORC is implicated in heterochromatin formation (e.g., at silent mating loci and telomeres), so perhaps ORC- containing regions are silent chromatin, hence not active. So properly, in the active chromatin regions signatures(SAGA, Mediator), features (H3K4me3, acetylation), but in regions where ORC is, maybe replication origins or silent regions. So origin is separate. Therefore, which complex is missing in active chromatin? the origin recognition complex.

Another angle, the mating process in yeast leads to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase prior to shmooing and mating. The ORC (origin recognition complex) binds origins of replication during G1 phase to prepare for S phase, but by the time cells are mating, maybe they are in a non-replicative state, but ORC is still bound. However, ORC in combination with Sir proteins helps in silent chromatin at HML and HMR, which are yeast silent mating type loci. Since the induction of shmoo comes from activation of these genes (which were previously silent via Sir proteins), perhaps during activation those regions are cleared of ORC. Alternatively, perhaps ORC-bound regions are silent, so active chromatin would lack ORC.

Given that, ORC complex would not be found in active chromatin. Hence, among the answer options, ORC proteins would be least observed. Alternatively, cohesin. Cohesin is applied in sister chromatid cohesion during S phase and post. But in G1, cohesin's role? Research says cohesin is involved in chromosome structure and transcription, even in G1. Indeed, cohesin facilitates loop formation, interaction between promoters and enhancers. So involved in transcription. Hence, if cohesin is involved in active transcription, then maybe that's not the answer. So back to condensin.

Another possibility is something else, like the spindle pole body. However, in chromatin, such structure wouldnât. Wait, the question is looking for which Complex, i.e., answer options happen to be possible choices: Proteasome, SMC complexes (condensin, cohesin), Mediator, SWI/SNF, the lagging one could be. Since it's stated the least of the options provided.

In the original scenario, it's leastâ so between Mediator complex proteins (present), RNA polymerase II (present), SAGA (present), origin replication complex (absent), condensin (absent).

The question is pulled probably from textbook Q&A where for a similar scenario, the ORC complex is the answer. However, let's access standard textbooks. Is there a conventional item that is expected?

In transcriptionally active chromatin, the ORC would not be associated, as active regions are replication origins typically euchromatic, ORC may not be standard. But conflicting info. Answers others: If the yeast is in mating and G1 phase, DNA replication has not happened. ORC is involved in licensing origins but not necessarily activeness. Aso, finite attention.

The author might expect the answer to be the Origin Recognition Complex as incorrect in the active chromatin of Shmoo cells.

Alternatively, the Swi/Snf: How is Swi/Snf used? Name of SWI stands for ' Sucrose nonfermenting, which is involved in remodelling chromatin structure to allow transcription, meaning their presence would be EXPECTED in active chromatin. So incorrect if they are expected.

Assuming it's saying "which complex's proteins won't be there", and options include the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), in which case ORC is the answer. Or perhaps replication protein A (RPA), but not part of a complex.

Alternatively, perhaps Cohesin is present, Mediator present, so the least observed would be the origin replication (ORC) complex.

I think the most probable answer the question is expecting is that the Origin Recognition Complex would be the least observed since the shmooing yeast cells are probably arrested in G1 phase and not in S phase where ORC is more active. However, the ORC is still bound to origin sites even in G1 for replication licensing, but maybe isn't part of active chromatin regions.

Alternatively, the NURD complex involved in deacetylation (but not in yeast). Possibly the answer is the Rpd3 complex (histone deacetylase) being absent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the Î² clamp sliding complex, but that's for replication (PCNA), again not the answer.

Still, among textbooks and examples: If the question is testing knowledge that actively transcribed genes are replicated early in S phase. Origin recognition complex (ORC) marks origins; early replicating regions are gene-rich and active. So maybe ORC is associated with active chromatin. That complicates. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ORC isn't, but the replication origins in yeast are enriched for active genes, but still. Alternatively, maybe the complex that's involved in rDNA silencing.

Dilemma entails insufficient data without options. Context points towards Midterm-style question.

But shmoo formation and active chromatin makes me posit that Mediator, RNA pol II, etc., are present. Those absent: condensin, ORC, etc.

Alternatively, subunit of DNA Polymerase perhaps, but that's in replication. So in the assay targeting active chromatin during transcription, replication complexes wouldn't be seen.

Suppose answer is ORC.

Hence, the final answer after hair-splitting is that origin recognition complex (ORC) proteins would be the least observed.
