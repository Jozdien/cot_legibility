# Original Question

A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.

The 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.

In the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

The key cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product arises due to the spatial proximity of the **bridgehead protons adjacent to the anhydride oxygens** and one of the **methyl groups from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene moiety**. 

In the major product, the endo transition state of the Diels-Alder reaction places the diene's methyl groups in close proximity to the bridgehead protons (originally part of the anhydride's double bond). This spatial arrangement leads to NOESY correlations between these groups. In the minor (exo) product, the methyl groups are oriented away from the bridgehead, diminishing or eliminating this interaction. 

**Answer:** The cross-peak connects the resonance of the **bridgehead protons** (near the anhydride oxygens) and the **methyl group(s)** from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene. Specifically, the protons corresponding to the original anhydride's alkene (now bridgehead protons in the major product) and the methyl groups from positions syn to the anhydride oxygens.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. Okay, so first, let's break down the information given. 

We have a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is mentioned: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. Then this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3. The key point is the NOESY spectrum of the major product has a cross-peak that's absent or weak in the minor. We need to figure out which two resonances (protons) are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, let's figure out the structure of the anhydride. The dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene... dehydration would form an anhydride. Dicarboxylic acids, when dehydrated, usually form cyclic anhydrides if they have the right structure. For instance, maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) forms maleic anhydride upon dehydration. Similarly, if our dicarboxylic acid has a cis double bond, the anhydride would be a five-membered cyclic anhydride. 

The NMR data for the anhydride: the 1H has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's interesting because usually, maleic anhydride's protons (if it's similar to maleic) would show a singlet. But wait, maleic anhydride actually has two protons on the double bond, adjacent to the anhydride. But in maleic anhydride, the protons are deshielded and appear around 6.2 ppm (if I recall correctly). Wait, maybe there's another structure here. The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 and 165 ppm. Carbonyl groups in anhydrides are usually around 165-175 ppm. The 165 ppm could be the carbonyl carbons. Then 137 ppm could be the carbons in the double bond. Since it's a cyclic anhydride, maybe the double bond carbons. 

Wait, maleic anhydride's structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds: O=C-C-O-C=O, with a double bond between the two central carbons. Wait, no, the structure of maleic anhydride is a cyclic structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected by an oxygen, with a double bond in the ring. For maleic anhydride, the carbons in the ring (the CH groups) are connected by a double bond. So the 1H NMR would have two protons in a trans configuration. But the problem says the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak. A singlet at 7 ppm would mean no splitting, so equivalent protons. If there's a double bond but the protons are equivalent, maybe the double bond is part of a ring that makes the two protons equivalent. For instance, like in a bicyclic structure or a symmetric arrangement. But maybe the anhydride is maleic anhydride. Wait, maleic anhydride has two protons on the double bond, but they are in a trans configuration, right? But in maleic anhydride, the protons are in a cis configuration relative to the ring. Wait, the double bond in maleic anhydride is conjugated with the carbonyl groups, making the two CH protons equivalent. Wait, no. Maleic anhydride is a planar molecule? If the molecule is symmetric, then the two protons would be equivalent, giving a singlet. Maybe that's what's happening here. Let me confirm that. The structure of maleic anhydride is a cyclopentene derivative with two carbonyl oxygens. The double bond is between C2 and C3 (if the ring is numbered as O=C-O-C=C-O). Wait, maybe the ring is cyclopent-2,5-dien-1,3-dione?, No. Let's draw it. Structure is cyclic: O=C-O-C-(CH)2-O-C=O? No, maleic anhydride has the structure where the five-membered ring includes the two carbonyl groups and the double bond. So positions 1 and 2 are carbonyl groups, positions 3 and 4 are the double bond. So positions 1 and 2 are the oxygens connected to the carbonyl groups. Wait, maybe numbering starts differently. The actual structure is a cyclopentene ring with two ketone groups. The double bond is between the carbons adjacent to the oxygen atoms. Therefore, the two protons on the double bond are cis to each other. However, in such a structure, are the two protons on the double bond equivalent? Because of the symmetry of the molecule (mirror plane), yes. The molecule is symmetric, so the two protons would be equivalent, leading to a singlet in 1H NMR. So that explains the singlet at 7 ppm. Then the 13C NMR shows 137 and 165 ppm. The 165 ppm is likely the carbonyl carbons (typical for anhydride carbonyls). The 137 ppm would be the sp2 carbons in the double bond. So that fits: two carbonyl carbons (165 ppm each) and two double bond carbons (137 ppm each), and since the molecule is symmetric, the 13C spectrum would have two peaks. So, yes, so the anhydride is maleic anhydride.

But wait, maleic anhydride is a known compound. Let me check: the structure is a cyclic anhydride of maleic acid, which is cis-butenedioic acid. The anhydride maleic has a double bond in the ring, which is less strained because the conjugated system. The NMR of maleic anhydride. Let me see. In 1H NMR, maleic anhydride's protons. So the two protons on the double bond. According to SDBS or some chemical database, maleic anhydride's 1H NMR (CDCl3) has a singlet at Î´ 6.70 (for the two protons). So close to 7, but here the problem says 7 ppm. Close enough perhaps, considering solvent differences or different substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the dicarboxylic acid is not maleic acid but another cis-dicarboxylic acid. Wait, maybe the anhydride is another type. Let me think.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 and 165. So two carbons each. The carbonyl carbons (two) at 165 and the double bond carbons (two) at 137. So that would imply that there are two equivalent carbonyl carbons and two equivalent double bond carbons. The structure would have symmetry. So perhaps the anhydride is indeed a cyclic structure similar to maleic anhydride. So that part I think is acceptable.

Moving on, the anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product has molecular formula C13H16O3. Let's see. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That would be a cyclopentene ring with four methyl groups: at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, since the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, the structure is a cyclopentene ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, cyclopentadiene with 1,3-diene (cumulative?), but wait cyclopentadiene is usually conjugated. Wait, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds. Wait, but the description is 1,3-cyclopentadiene. That might imply positions 1 and 3 are double bonds? Wait, in a cyclopentadiene, there are two double bonds. However, in a five-membered ring, two conjugated double bonds would be 1,3-diene. But that's not possible in a five-membered ring. Wait, cyclopentadiene typically refers to 1,3-pentadiene in a ring. Wait, no. Cyclopentadiene is usually cyclopenta-1,3-diene? No, that would require a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, but then the ring would have four carbons, which is not possible. Wait, I'm confused here. Wait, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds. For example, the structure is cyclopentene with another double bond. Wait, maybe it's a bicyclic compound, but no. Let me check. The correct structure for cyclopentadiene. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene isn't possible because in a five-membered ring, two double bonds would be 1,2 and 3,4 (but that's butadiene in the ring). Alternatively, maybe the molecule is cyclopentenyl with an exo methylene? No, the compound is given as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's break it down.

The base compound is 1,3-cyclopentadiene. So cyclopentadiene with double bonds at 1 and 3. Wait, but in a cyclopentadiene (five-membered ring with two double bonds), the positions would be 1 and 3. But how? That's possible only in a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, no, that's actually not achievable in a five-membered ring because of Baeyer's strain. Wait, perhaps it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene as in a monoene? If it's a five-membered ring with one double bond between C1 and C2, and another adjacent double bond (for diene), maybe C3 and C4? But in a cyclopentane ring, that would make the diene conjugated? Like cyclopent-1,3-diene? But the five-membered ring with two non-conjugated double bonds would not be called a 1,3-cyclopentadiene. Alternatively, maybe the diene is a conjugated one. For cyclopentadiene, the common structure is cyclopenta-1,3-diene. Wait, actually, I think that's correct. Wait, no, the structure of cyclopentadiene is typically either cyclopent-1,3-diene or cyclopent-1,4-diene. Wait, but in reality, cyclopentadiene usually refers to cyclopenta-1,3-diene, which is non-aromatic and can undergo Diels-Alder reactions. But in any case, the starting diene here is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, meaning that positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the ring is cyclopentadiene (maybe 1,3-diene?) with methyl groups on all four positions. That would have four methyl substituents on the ring. Let me try to draw this.

Assuming the cyclopentadiene ring is in the 1,3 positions. Then positions 1 and 3 are part of the double bonds, but wait, a five-membered ring with two double bonds would have two adjacent double bonds? For example, 1,2 and 3,4? But that's a cumulated diene? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe it's a five-membered ring with one double bond (a monoene) and substituents. Wait, but the compound is called 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which probably implies two double bonds. Wait, actually, that's tricky. Let's think again.

Alternatively, the diene in question might have a conjugated diene system. For a five-membered ring, the only way to have a conjugated diene is to have the ring include the diene, but that would require four carbons in a row with double bonds. For example, a cyclopentene ring with an exo double bond? Wait, maybe it's a norbornene-like structure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a transannular diene. Wait, perhaps I should move past this and think about the reaction. The reaction is between an anhydride (likely maleic anhydride-like) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product is a Diels-Alder adduct. Wait, Diels-Alder reactions require a diene and a dienophile. The anhydride here could act as the dienophile. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile. So the anhydride would undergo a Diels-Alder reaction with the cyclopentadiene derivative. 

But wait, our diene here is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. If the cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, then the Diels-Alder reaction would proceed. However, such a diene with four methyl groups would be quite bulky. The reaction would form a six-membered ring via [4+2] cycloaddition. The product would be a bicyclic structure with the anhydride part as the dienophile. 

But wait, the molecular formula of the product is C13H16O3. Let's check the stoichiometry. The anhydride (assuming maleic anhydride) has a formula of C4H2O3. The diene would be C9H14 (if the diene is cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups: molecular formula for 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. The cyclopentene would normally be C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (4*15=60? Wait, CH3 is 15 g/mol each. So the diene is C5H6 + 4*CH3 = C5+4C=9C, H6 + 4*2= H14). So molecular formula C9H14. Then, the anhydride is C4H2O3. So combining (C4H2O3) + (C9H14) â C13H16O3. Yes, that gives the product C13H16O3, which matches. 

So, the Diels-Alder reaction between the diene and the anhydride. The product would be a bicyclic compound where the cyclopentadiene adds to the maleic anhydride. But given the diene is very substituted (four methyl groups), we have to think about the regiochemistry and stereochemistry here. When the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile (electron-deficient double bond), and the cyclopentadiene derivative is the diene (electron-rich). In the Diels-Alder product, the endo rule suggests that the more substituted (bulkier) groups would end up on the same face, but perhaps here steric factors may influence the major vs. minor products.

But the problem states there are two products, major and minor. These would result from different stereoisomerism. The Diels-Alder reaction typically gives an endo transition state leading to an endo product. However, with bulky substituents, sometimes the exo product might form. Wait, but why two products? Perhaps if there's an issue of facial selectivity. If the cyclopentadiene has four methyl groups, maybe the approach of the dienophile could be different leading to different diastereomers. Alternatively, the endo vs. exo approach can cause different stereochemistry. But in those cases, there would be different stereochemistry in the adduct. However, the problem states that products have the same molecular formula but differ in configuration. The 2D NOESY is about spatial proximity of protons. The cross-peak in major's spectrum is absent or weak in minor's, which implies a spatial proximity present in the major product but not the minor.

Now, the question is which protons are connected by the cross-peak in the major product. Let's think. The cross-peak in NOESY indicates that two protons are close in space (within ~5 Ã). So in the major product, two protons are close that are not in the minor.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the newly formed six-membered ring would have a bridgehead where the oxygen atoms from the anhydride are. The substituents from the diene (the four methyl groups) would be arranged in the bicyclic structure. The endo transition state might bring the substituents on the same face. Alternatively, the endo rule would lead to substituents being placed in the proximity. So if in the major product, the endo transition state leads to certain methyl groups or substituents being adjacent spatially, perhaps a methyl group (part of the original diene) is near a proton from the anhydride part.

But wait, the product incorporates the diene and the anhydride into a bicyclic structure. The original maleic anhydride becomes a six-membered ring fused to the cyclopentane ring (from the diene). Let me visualize the Diels-Alder adduct. The diene (cyclopentadiene) attacks the dienophile (anhydride). The maleic anhydride (the dienophile) is a flat, conjugated molecule. The diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene) would approach it. The reaction forms a bicyclic structure: the original cyclopentadiene becomes part of a bicyclic system. The adduct has a bridge formed by the addition.

But to better understand, let me consider the regioselectivity and stereochemistry. In the Diels-Alder reaction, the electron-rich diene's more substituted end (with more substituents) would attack the electron-poor end of the dienophile. However, in our case, the dienophile is symmetric (maleic anhydride), so attack from either end would give the same product. The substituents (methyl groups) on the diene are all around the ring. So cyclopentadiene has substituents on positions 1,2,3,4. Let me imagine this. The cyclopentadiene would have methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4, and the double bonds at 1,3. Wait, this might not be accurate. Let me try to define the structure. If it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene, that suggests two double bonds? That's not possible unless the ring is something else. Wait, perhaps the diene is a 1,3-diene as in a conjugated system. But in a five-membered ring, it's more likely a fused system or perhaps the diene is part of a bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a typo, and it should be 1,3-pentadiene. But in the context, it's stated as 1,3-cyclopentadiene, so being part of a ring. Maybe the compound is cyclopentene with another double bond. Wait, perhaps the diene is similar to norbornene. Let me think: norbornene is bicyclic with a double bond. If our diene is a substituted norbornene. Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene may refer to a norbornadiene-like structure with four methyl groups. Alternatively, the compound could be 1,3-dicyclopentadiene with methyl substitutions.

But perhaps the structure isn't crucial here. Let's focus on the reaction: Diels-Alder between the anhydride and the diene leads to two diastereomers, major and minor. The key difference lies in their stereochemistry, leading to a different spatial arrangement of substituents, which is reflected in NOESY. NOESY cross-peaks indicate spatial proximity between protons.

So, after the Diels-Alder reaction, the major product would have certain groups closer together than in the minor product. Let's imagine the bicyclic structure. The maleic anhydride's oxygens would be part of the bridge. The cyclopentene ring (from the diene) would be fused to the new six-membered ring. The bridgehead would be where the exo-oxygens are. If the endo transition state causes the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) to be oriented in a way that certain protons are close, for example, the methyl groups may be anti or syn to each other. Alternatively, if the endo product has one of the methyl groups in close proximity to a hydrogen from the anhydride part.

Wait, after the Diels-Alder reaction, the maleic anhydride is incorporated into a six-membered ring. The adjacent to the oxygen atoms (from the anhydride), there are two bridgehead protons. Let me draw this mentally. The original dienophile (the anhydride) gets added across the diene. The resulting structure would have the oxygens of the anhydride at the bridgehead of the bicyclic system.

In the bicyclic structure, there might be protons (like the two bridgehead protons from the anhydride's double bond) that are now adjacent to methyl groups from the cyclopentadiene. If in the major product, one of these bridgehead protons is near a methyl group (from the diene's substituents), there would be a NOESY cross-peak between the bridgehead protons and the methyl protons. Conversely, in the minor product, this proximity is absent or lessened.

Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups are oriented in such a way that in the major product, two methyl groups are closer to each other than in the minor, leading to a cross-peak. But in the NMR, the integrals are taken from the 1H NMR. Let's consider what the 1H NMR of the products might look like.

The formula C13H16O3. The anhydride contributes O3 and some carbons. The molecule is likely bicyclic. The 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl groups would give rise to several singlet peaks (integrated for the methyl groups) if they are in equivalent environments. But in the bicyclic structure, the methyl groups might be in different environments. If the major product has some equivalent methyl groups and others that are nonequivalent, perhaps the NOESY cross-peak connects a proton in the bridge (like an axial versus equatorial proton) with a methyl group.

But this is getting a bit vague. Let's focus on specific concepts. The key is the major product's structure vs. the minor. The presence of a cross-peak in NOESY implies that two protons are spatially close.

A classic scenario in Diels-Alder adducts is the endo rule, where the endo transition state leads to substituents being on the same face. This often results in the endo product having substituents that are cis to each other. However, the dienophile (maleic anhydride) in this reaction forms a bridge in the adduct. The substituent (methyl groups) from the diene would be positioned either adjacent to the oxygens (bridgehead) or opposite.

Let me think about the adduct structure. The Diels-Alder product would be a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative. Wait, if the diene is a 1,3-cyclopentadiene and the dienophile is maleic anhydride, forming a bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, in the Diels-Alder reaction, the cyclopentadiene (this five-membered ring diene) would add the maleic anhydride across two of its carbons, forming a six-membered ring. The product structure would have a bridge where the oxygen atoms are. For example, carbon 1 and 4 of the diene adding to the dienophile's ends.

But maybe the product is bicyclo[2.2.1] structure. Let me see. The standard Diels-Alder gives a six-membered ring with substituents on the endo face. With the maleic anhydride as dienophile, the bicyclic system would incorporate the maleic part into the ring. However, given the substituents on the diene (four methyl groups), the bicyclic structure's substituents will influence the cross-peak.

Alternatively, perhaps in the major product, one of the bridgehead protons (from the original maleic anhydride's double bond, now positioned in the bridge) is close to a methyl group from the diene. The original double bond protons in maleic anhydride (the singlet at 7 ppm) would have been converted into single bonds in the adduct. Wait, no: the Diels-Alder adds across the dienophile's double bond. So the maleic anhydride's double bond is the dienophile; adding to diene would form two new single bonds, breaking the double bond. So after the Diels-Alder reaction, the maleic part becomes part of a six-membered ring cyclohexene derivative. But with the original cyclopentene replaced by cyclopentadiene.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Perhaps I need to think of the possible structures involved here.

When the maleic anhydride reacts with a diene (like cyclopentadiene), the product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride, perhaps. But in the presence of substituted diene, the substituents (methyl groups) would be at specific positions. In the adducts, there may be endo and exo products, differing in the position of substituents.

Suppose the major product is the endo adduct, where the methyl groups are on the same face as the bridging oxygen. In that case, certain protons adjacent to the oxygen (from the anhydride part) would be in proximity to a methyl group. In the exo (minor) product, these methyl groups would be on the opposite face, away from those protons. The cross-peak would show this proximity in the major product but not in the minor.

Alternatively, maybe the cross-peak is between a methyl group and a vicinal proton in the bridge. Alternatively, a methyl group and the bridgehead proton. But how to identify which specific protons?

Alternatively, consider the original maleic anhydride's 1H NMR. It had a singlet for the two equivalent protons at 7 ppm. In the Diels-Alder product, those protons would be gone (since the double bond is opened), but new protons are added from the diene. Wait, maleic anhydride after Diels-Alder would lose its two double bond protons as the dienophile's double bond becomes single. The protons from the dienophile's double bond (if any) are not present. Wait, maleic anhydride's dienophile double bond was originally between the two carbon atoms. In the Diels-Alder adduct, those two carbons form new single bonds to the diene. So those original vicinal protons (from dienophile double bond) are no longer present. Therefore, the maleic anhydride's protons are converted into two new single bonds. Therefore, the product's protons contributing to the cross-peak must come from the diene.

But in this case, the diene's protons would be part of the new ring system. Assuming the diene's substituents are all methyl groups (since it's 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene), then the protons in the product would mostly be methyl groups. However, the Diels-Alder reaction's new bonds form from the diene's ends (positions 1 and 4 if the conjugated diene is carbons 1-2 and 3-4) adding to the dienophile. So perhaps the carbons with two methyl groups (positions 1,2,3,4) would end up being substituents in the bicyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) is structured such that positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 each have methyl groups. So the diene is actually positions 1 and 3. If that's the case, let's imagine the cyclopentadiene ring: positions 1-2 and 3-4 are double bonds. But no, that leads to a very strained structure. I think it's more plausible that the cyclopentadiene ring has a conjugated diene (positions 1-2 and 3-4?), but that might not close the ring properly. Wait, alternatively, the diene might be crossing a bridge. Suppose the cyclopentadiene is a norbornene-like structure with two double bonds. But norbornene itself is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. Wait, maybe the diene is a norbornadiene (two double bonds) with four methyl groups. However, this complicates things. Since it's possible the diene is a substituted norbornadiene.

But perhaps I need to simplify. Let's represent the diene as a cyclopentene ring with two methyl groups each on positions 1,2,3,4. The reaction forms a Diels-Alder adduct with maleic anhydride. In the product, the original maleic anhydride becomes part of a six-membered ring fused to the cyclopentene ring, now with four methyl groups. The bridge would have the two oxygen atoms from the anhydride.

In such a bicyclic structure, the two protons adjacent to the bridging oxygen atoms (from the original maleic anhydride) would be in a specific spatial arrangement. If in the major product, those protons are near one or more methyl groups (from the diene's substituents), the NOESY cross-peak would show this proximity.

Alternatively, the methyl groups may be positioned such that some are syn to certain protons in the bridge. For example, methyl groups on the same face as the bridge protons would result in cross-peak in the NOESY. Conversely, the minor product may have methyl groups anti, leading to no or weak cross-peak.

To pinpoint which protons: the methyl groups (from the diene) and adjacent protons (like bridgehead protons or others). The original maleic anhydride contributed no protons that remain in the product (its protons were part of the double bond, and the reaction adds new bonds there). Therefore, the cross-peak must involve protons from the diene region and possibly anHydrogens near the oxygen.

Wait, but the anhydride structure now is fused into the bicyclic system. The oxygen bridge would have adjacent carbon centers. On these bridgehead carbons, adjacent protons could exist. If so, these protons could have coupling with methyl groups from the diene's substituents.

But another approach: when Diels-Alder forms the bicyclic system, the endo transition state brings substituents into close proximity to the dienophile. For instance, methyl groups on the same face as the incoming dienophile would be endo and thus close in space to the dienophile parts. Hence, in the major product (endo), methyl groups are near the bridgehead oxygen, while in the exo product (minor), they are on the opposite face. NOESY between a bridgehead proton (say, adjacent to the oxygen) and a methyl group (from diene) would be present in the major product but not in the minor.

Alternatively, the major product's structure has a methyl group near the carbonyl oxygen's adjacent proton, so there's a cross-peak between methyl and that proton. To identify the protons, one needs to look at the regions of the 1H NMR. 

Assuming the four methyl groups from the diene are in different environments, some of them might be adjacent to electronegative atoms (oxygen), causing their chemical shifts to differ. For instance, methyl groups near oxygen could be deshielded. Alternatively, perhaps the maleic anhydride-derived part has protons at around 5 ppm (bridgehead protons), while the methyl groups are as usual around 0.9-1.5 ppm. Wait, but methyl groups are typically in the range of 0.5-1.5 ppm. If any are adjacent to oxygen, maybe they shift upfield? Not necessarily; proximity to oxygen can lead to deshielding (downfield shift). For example, OCH3 is around 3.3 ppm, but that's for oxygen-attached carbons. For an adjacent CH3, perhaps shift is minimal. Alternatively, in a bicyclic structure, the ring current effects or anisotropy could cause a shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride's carbonyl groups would lead to deshielding of nearby protons. If a methyl group is adjacent to the oxygen bridge, its protons might be slightly downfield.

Assuming that in the major product, certain methyl groups are near the bridgehead protons (possibly axial or equatorial), leading to a NOESY cross-peak between a methyl proton and a bridgehead proton. Alternatively, the bridgehead protons might be the ones that in the major product are close to each other. Wait, but in the original anhydride, the protons were equivalent, but now in the bicyclic structure, the bridgehead protons may no longer be equivalent. But the 1H NMR of the product shows integralsâso the cross-peak connects specific proton signals.

But the problem states that the cross-peak is between two resonances in the major product's 1H NMR. If one of the peaks is from a methyl group (integrated as a singlet) and another is from a bridgehead proton (maybe a multiplet). The exact positions would relate to their chemical shifts. However, given the Answer requires citing two specific resonances connected by the cross-peak, but the exact shifts aren't providedâonly referring to their integrals. Wait, but in the scenario, the info comes from the corresponding 1H NMR, but integrals here in terms of peak areas correlating to number of protons.

Wait, the problem statement may imply that the cross-peak is between two protons that correspond to specific peaks (shifts not given here, but maybe deduced from the question's information). From the initial description, the anhydride NMR had a singlet at 7 ppm in 1H NMR. But in the product, there's C13H16O3. How do the product's protons look? Maybe after the Diels-Alder, the product has ester groups (from the anhydride opening up) and the methyl groups from the diene. 

Alternatively, since it's an anhydride, when it undergoes Diels-Alder, it forms a six-membered ring with ester functionalities. Therefore, in the product, two of the original carbonyl groups from the anhydride are now ketones or esters. No, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the oxygen atoms remain as ether linkages in the adduct. Wait, no; the Diels-Alder of maleic anhydride and cyclopentadiene gives a bicyclic structure with two ester groups. For example, the product is endo-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride. However, but in this case, the diene is more substituted.

Given the nitty-gritty, perhaps the cross-peak in the major product's NOESY is between the bridgehead protons (from the anhydride) and one of the methyl groups. Specifically, the major product has methyl groups oriented towards these protons, while the minor product doesn't. However, without knowing the exact NMR shifts, I need to integrate what's given.

But the original anhydride had a singlet at 7 ppm, which was the H on the double bond. These protons become part of the six-membered ring in the adduct. So the product may not have these protons anymore. However, new bridge protons in the bicyclic structure could give different shifts. For example, exo and endo protons can have different chemical environments. 

Alternatively, the protons adjacent to the oxygen atoms in the bridge might show up at around 5 ppm (if axial ) or upfield if in a shielded environment. Methinks if there's an Oxygen nearby, maybe a downfield shift. Alternatively, if in a bridgehead position with strain, could be upfield. However, in bicyclic systems, bridgehead protons can be upfield. 

Alternatively, the cross-peak could be between two equivalent methyl groups. If in the major product, a pair of methyl groups are in close proximity (cis), causing a NOESY correlation. However, since all the diene substituents are methyl, and there are four of them, integrating this might suggest varied environments.

Alternatively, perhaps in the major product, methyl groups at positions that were endo (close to newly formed bridge) are near protons that are part of the bridge (for example, protons on the bridgehead). In that case, the cross-peak would be between a bridgehead proton (say, around Î´ 2-3 ppm) and a methyl group (at Î´ 1 ppm). But in the questions, the reference to integrals would hint at which protons they are. For example, if the bridgehead protons have a certain integration (like 2H), and a methyl group (integrated at 3H each, perhaps multiple)

Given the molecular formula, C13H16O3. Let me also count the sites of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation: 

DU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2 = (2*13 +2 -16 -0)/2 = (28-16)/2=6. 6 degrees of unsaturation: likely two rings and two double bonds, given that DU are each counted as rings or double bonds. The Diels-Alder product usually forms a six-membered ring with one double bond adjacent to the oxygen (since the dienophile's double bond is consumed). But in this case, maybe the product has an anhydride ring (which is a cyclic ester, hence another ring). Wait, maleic anhydride as dienophile becomes part of the bicyclic structure. So original maleic anhydride has two rings: five-membered anhydride. In the Diels-Alder product, however, the five-membered anhydride becomes incorporated into the larger bicyclic system.

Overall, my conclusion is that the cross-peak in the major product connects a proton in the bridge (from the anhydride's original double bond) and a methyl group from the diene. Since the problemâs answer likely requires specifying the groups as, say, the methine (CH) protons next to the anhydride oxygens and one of the methyl groups. 

Alternatively, suppose the major product, resulting from endo transition state, has a methyl group (from the diene) in proximity to an axial proton in the bridge, while the exo product has it not close. Then the cross-peak would be between that methyl and the bridgehead proton. 

Alternatively, perhaps the major product has a aromatic_syn interaction due to the endo transition state, aligning certain diene methyl groups close to the bridged protons. But since this is getting very speculative, and considering the usual answer to such questions, in Diels-Alder reactions the endo rule leads the dienophile's substituents (like oxygen groups) to be near the end-caps of the bicyclic system, and the NOE cross-peak would be between a bridgehead proton and a neighboring methyl group. 

Given that I'm a bit stuck, and looking up analogous problems,jimagine that in Diels-Alder adducts with bulky dienes, the endo transition state places bulky groups near the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile (the anhydride's oxygens). Thus, there may be a spatial proximity between the methyl group (part of the cyclopentadiene's substituents) and a bridgehead hydrogen. If in the major (endo) product, a methyl group is near the bridgehead proton, then in the NOESY, a cross-peak would appear between the methyl protons and the bridgehead proton.

Assuming the bridgehead protons are of low multiplicity (possibly singlets if equivalent). But given that maleic anhydride's original two equivalent protons (at 7 ppm) might now be non-equivalent bridgehead protons in the adduct. Alternatively, maybe the Hidrogen bridgehead protons have different shifts. If one is close to a methyl group (in the major product), their shift might differ from that when separated (minor product). But unless the problem gave specific shifts for the products, deducing it is difficult, but the older info on the anhydride's original NMR may help.

Alternatively, back to the beginning, in the anhydride, the protons were a singlet at 7 ppm. The 13C in the anhydride was 137 (double bond) and 165 (carbonyl). In the Diels-Alder product, the double bond is gone, so those carbons are bridged. But the original dienophile carbons (double bond in the anhydride) would now be bound to the diene. Those carbons that were double bond carbons (137 ppm) might now be in a ring junction (bridgehead). The diene's methyl groups get attached to the carbons adjacent to the bridgehead oxygens.

If a methyl group is attached to a carbon adjacent to the bridgehead (exposed to protons nearby), then the NOESY might show this.

But considering the catch, the answer is likely referencing the proximity between the two protons that were originally in the anhydride's proton singlet. But after the reaction, those protons are part of the bridge and perhaps now are adjacent to the methyl groups placed in endo position in the major product.

Alternatively, maybe it's the methyl groups adjacent to the oxygen bridge that give the cross-peak. But methyl groups are usually singlet. Consider that the major product arranges a certain methyl group in the endo position, meaning closer in space to an oxygen bridge proton, leading to a cross-peak between the methyl protons and that bridge proton. In the minor product's exo arrangement, this interaction is weaker. The specific cross-peak would therefore be between the methyl group (likely as a singlet) and the bridge proton (maybe a triplet or doublet).

But without knowing exact shifts or splitting, the Answer could be referencing the two key groups involved, like comparing the methyl groups to the bridgehead protons. Since the anhydride's protons were at 7 ppm, but after reaction would it'rendered as part of the bridge. So, maybe shifted upfield. Assuming is the cross-peak between bridgehead protons (around delta 5-6 ppm) and a methyl group (around 1 ppm)

But I'm not entirely certain. Another pointè±le'sthe crosspeak in the major product is present, implying that certain protons are close. The major product being endo rule: new groups are added to the same face as the dienophile. Since the dienophile was maleic anhydride, the endo transition state would place bulky groups (methyl groups) on the same side as the carbonyl groups. Therefore, the methyl groups would be close to the oxygen in the bridge leading to a crosspeak between methyl protons and nearby protons.

But given that you're talking about NOESY crosspeak between two resonance lines, corresponding to two groups spatially close. If there's a ëMe group near an HS proton (like a CH2 group near a methyl), but given the complexity, there's a simpler way: in the major product from endo transition state, the substituents (methyls) are near the oxygen atoms, thus close to the protons neighboring these oxygens. These protons would show peaks perhaps downfield shifted. The crosspeak then connects the methyl group's protons with the protons adjacent to the oxygen.

Alternatively, the simplest answer is that in the major (endo) product, one of the methyl groups is near the bridgehead protons, so the cross-peak is between the methyl group's peak and the bridgehead protons. In the minor (exo) product, they are far apart. Given that anhydrideâs original protons were in a singlet at 7 ppm, after reacting and forming the bridgehead, these might shift, but perhaps the new bridgehead protons would be somewhere else, maybe 5-6 ppm. Methyl groups around 1 ppm. So crosspeak between 1 ppm and 5-6 ppm? Alternatively, maybe the exact shifts would align, with the bridgehead protons remaining at similar shift (7 ppm), but that original double bond becomes part of the bridge and isn't a vinyl proton anymore. Thus, their shift changes.

Given that I may be overcomplicating, let me think classic textbook examples. In the Diels-Alder of maleic anhydride with a Diels, the endo rule creates an inside relationship between substituents. Thus, in the major product, the substituents are oriented towards the bulky side. The cyclopentadiene in typical cases (with bulky groups like methyl) would have the substituents endo. Hence, leading the methyl groups to be near the bridgehead protons. The cross-peak would then be between the methyl group protons and these bridgehead protons. Answer: cross-peak connects methyl group protons and bridgehead protons. Depending on the questions' integral mentions, if the methyl gives a singlet (integral 3H) at, say, 1.2 ppm, and a bridgehead proton (2H) in a multiplet at 3 ppm, then. But exact shifts might depend on the structure.

But since the question wants the answer to be "which two resonances connected by the cross-peak", and given historicalcontext of similar problems, the answer likely pairs the oxyen-anhydride adjacent protons with a methyl group. The exact answer mightìê¸°unoepeakle between the bridgehead protons and methyl sinRegionAtion.

But or maybe the bridgehead itself has a proton that's equivalent and give singlet, 1H that's near a CH3 group. Hmm. Given that all that, I think the key protons are the axial protons adjacent to the oxygen bridge and a nearby methyl group. In endo, these are cis arranged allowing for proximity. So the answer is: the cross-peak connect the singletdienophile-derived bridgehead proton resonance (originally at 7 ppm, but shifted in product) and theresonance from a methyl group in the dien. However, needing to fit the NMR integrals maybe in terms of the number of protons for each.

Take in consideration that during Diels-Alder reaction, maleic anhydride's two carbÏnyl groups form part of the six-membered ring â now fused with the diene's Ï system. Given the reaction, the bridgehead positions would be where the former maleic anhydride's carbons are, now flanking the oxygen bridge.

If these bridgehead positions each carry a proton (since maleic anhydride's original carbons were bound to oxygen and now are connected to the diene) â perhaps those protons are in the vicinity of the methyl groups from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene. Given that in the endo, major product, those methyl groups are closer, generating the cross-peak.

Thus, the answer is that the cross-peak connects the protons adjacent to the oxygen in the anhydride bridge (downfield-shifted, perhaps originally from maleic anhydride's double peak) with the methyl groups from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene. Given the integral, the answer might specify the benzo-type protons or bridged protons, but perhaps referencing their chemical shifts (but those are Relay give in the problem. However, the question states that the integrals are taken from the 1H NMR, so each cross-correlate cá»§a Proponents the major product would have I equip wonderful, with two resonances â one from a bridgehead proton and a methyl group. Given the Original anhydrideâs 1H NMR had a singlet at 7 ppm, which corresponds to two protons. In the product, bridgehead protons might be in a different region but correspond to certain integrals.

However, thereâs another angle. The carbonyl carbons in the anhydride were at 165 ppm in 13C NMR. In the productâs 13C NMR, these would remain similarly. But protons are on nearby carbons. The hot Peaie in NOESY is between these COA-derived protons and them challenge substituents.

In the end after pondering, the two connected protons are those adjacent to the carbonyl groups (give more alternating shift) and the methyl group endo position. So likely, the answer corresponds to a methyl group's Proton resonance and the bridgehead protons'. Hence, here's the answer:

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. Okay, so first, let's break down the information given. 

We have a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is mentioned: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. Then this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3. The key point is the NOESY spectrum of the major product has a cross-peak that's absent or weak in the minor. We need to figure out which two resonances (protons) are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, let's figure out the structure of the anhydride. The dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene... dehydration would form an anhydride. Dicarboxylic acids, when dehydrated, usually form cyclic anhydrides if they have the right structure. For instance, maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) forms maleic anhydride upon dehydration. Similarly, if our dicarboxylic acid has a cis double bond, the anhydride would be a five-membered cyclic anhydride. 

The NMR data for the anhydride: the 1H has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's interesting because usually, maleic anhydride's protons (if it's similar to maleic) would show a singlet. But wait, maleic anhydride actually has two protons on the double bond, adjacent to the anhydride. But in maleic anhydride, the protons are deshielded and appear around 6.2 ppm (if I recall correctly). Wait, maybe there's another structure here. The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 and 165 ppm. Carbonyl groups in anhydrides are usually around 165-175 ppm. The 165 ppm could be the carbonyl carbons. Then 137 ppm could be the carbons in the double bond. Since it's a cyclic anhydride, maybe the double bond carbons. 

Wait, maleic anhydride's structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds: O=C-C-O-C=O, with a double bond between the two central carbons. Wait, no, the structure of maleic anhydride is a cyclic structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected by an oxygen, with a double bond in the ring. For maleic anhydride, the carbons in the ring (the CH groups) are connected by a double bond. So the 1H NMR would have two protons in a trans configuration. But the problem says the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak. A singlet at 7 ppm would mean no splitting, so equivalent protons. If there's a double bond but the protons are equivalent, maybe the double bond is part of a ring that makes the two protons equivalent. For instance, like in a bicyclic structure or a symmetric arrangement. But maybe the anhydride is maleic anhydride. Wait, maleic anhydride has two protons on the double bond, but they are in a trans configuration, right? But in maleic anhydride, the protons are in a cis configuration relative to the ring. Wait, the double bond in maleic anhydride is conjugated with the carbonyl groups, making the two CH protons equivalent. Wait, no. Maleic anhydride is a planar molecule? If the molecule is symmetric, then the two protons would be equivalent, giving a singlet. Maybe that's what's happening here. Let me confirm that. The structure of maleic anhydride is a cyclopentene derivative with two carbonyl oxygens. The double bond is between C2 and C3 (if the ring is numbered as O=C-O-C=C-O). Wait, maybe the ring is cyclopent-2,5-dien-1,3-dione?, No. Let's draw it. Structure is cyclic: O=C-O-C-(CH)2-O-C=O? No, maleic anhydride has the structure where the five-membered ring includes the two carbonyl groups and the double bond. So positions 1 and 2 are carbonyl groups, positions 3 and 4 are the double bond. So positions 1 and 2 are the oxygens connected to the carbonyl groups. Wait, maybe numbering starts differently. The actual structure is a cyclopentene ring with two ketone groups. The double bond is between the carbons adjacent to the oxygen atoms. Therefore, the two protons on the double bond are cis to each other. However, in such a structure, are the two protons on the double bond equivalent? Because of the symmetry of the molecule (mirror plane), yes. The molecule is symmetric, so the two protons would be equivalent, leading to a singlet in 1H NMR. So that explains the singlet at 7 ppm. Then the 13C NMR shows 137 and 165 ppm. The 165 ppm is likely the carbonyl carbons (typical for anhydride carbonyls). The 137 ppm would be the sp2 carbons in the double bond. So that fits: two carbonyl carbons (165 ppm each) and two double bond carbons (137 ppm each), and since the molecule is symmetric, the 13C spectrum would have two peaks. So, yes, so the anhydride is maleic anhydride.

But wait, maleic anhydride is a known compound. Let me check: the structure is a cyclic anhydride of maleic acid, which is cis-butenedioic acid. The anhydride maleic has a double bond in the ring, which is less strained because the conjugated system. The NMR of maleic anhydride. Let me see. In 1H NMR, maleic anhydride's protons. So the two protons on the double bond. According to SDBS or some chemical database, maleic anhydride's 1H NMR (CDCl3) has a singlet at Î´ 6.70 (for the two protons). So close to 7, but here the problem says 7 ppm. Close enough perhaps, considering solvent differences or different substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the dicarboxylic acid is not maleic acid but another cis-dicarboxylic acid. Wait, maybe the anhydride is another type. Let me think.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 and 165. So two carbons each. The carbonyl carbons (two) at 165 and the double bond carbons (two) at 137. So that would imply that there are two equivalent carbonyl carbons and two equivalent double bond carbons. The structure would have symmetry. So perhaps the anhydride is indeed a cyclic structure similar to maleic anhydride. So that part I think is acceptable.

Moving on, the anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product has molecular formula C13H16O3. Let's see. The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That would be a cyclopentene ring with four methyl groups: at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, since the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, the structure is a cyclopentene ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, cyclopentadiene with 1,3-diene (cumulative?), but wait cyclopentadiene is usually conjugated. Wait, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds. Wait, but the description is 1,3-cyclopentadiene. That might imply positions 1 and 3 are double bonds? Wait, in a cyclopentadiene, there are two double bonds. However, in a five-membered ring, two conjugated double bonds would be 1,3-diene. But that's not possible in a five-membered ring. Wait, cyclopentadiene typically refers to 1,3-pentadiene in a ring. Wait, no. Cyclopentadiene is usually cyclopenta-1,3-diene? No, that would require a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, but then the ring would have four carbons, which is not possible. Wait, I'm confused here. Wait, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds. For example, the structure is cyclopentene with another double bond. Wait, maybe it's a bicyclic compound, but no. Let me check. The correct structure for cyclopentadiene. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene isn't possible because in a five-membered ring, two double bonds would be 1,2 and 3,4 (but that's butadiene in the ring). Alternatively, maybe the molecule is cyclopentenyl with an exo methylene? No, the compound is given as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's break it down.

The base compound is 1,3-cyclopentadiene. So cyclopentadiene with double bonds at 1 and 3. Wait, but in a cyclopentadiene (five-membered ring with two double bonds), the positions would be 1 and 3. But how? That's possible only in a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, no, that's actually not achievable in a five-membered ring because of Baeyer's strain. Wait, perhaps it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene as in a monoene? If it's a five-membered ring with one double bond between C1 and C2, and another adjacent double bond (for diene), maybe C3 and C4? But in a cyclopentane ring, that would make the diene conjugated? Like cyclopent-1,3-diene? But the five-membered ring with two non-conjugated double bonds would not be called a 1,3-cyclopentadiene. Alternatively, maybe the diene is a conjugated one. For cyclopentadiene, the common structure is cyclopenta-1,3-diene. Wait, actually, I think that's correct. Wait, no, the structure of cyclopentadiene is typically either cyclopent-1,3-diene or cyclopent-1,4-diene. Wait, but in reality, cyclopentadiene usually refers to cyclopenta-1,3-diene, which is non-aromatic and can undergo Diels-Alder reactions. But in any case, the starting diene here is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, meaning that positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the ring is cyclopentadiene (maybe 1,3-diene?) with methyl groups on all four positions. That would have four methyl substituents on the ring. Let me try to draw this.

Assuming the cyclopentadiene ring is in the 1,3 positions. Then positions 1 and 3 are part of the double bonds, but wait, a five-membered ring with two double bonds would have two adjacent double bonds? For example, 1,2 and 3,4? But that's a cumulated diene? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe it's a five-membered ring with one double bond (a monoene) and substituents. Wait, but the compound is called 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which probably implies two double bonds. Wait, actually, that's tricky. Let's think again.

Alternatively, the diene in question might have a conjugated diene system. For a five-membered ring, the only way to have a conjugated diene is to have the ring include the diene, but that would require four carbons in a row with double bonds. For example, a cyclopentene ring with an exo double bond? Wait, maybe it's a norbornene-like structure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a transannular diene. Wait, perhaps I should move past this and think about the reaction. The reaction is between an anhydride (likely maleic anhydride-like) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The product is a Diels-Alder adduct. Wait, Diels-Alder reactions require a diene and a dienophile. The anhydride here could act as the dienophile. Maleic anhydride is a classic dienophile. So the anhydride would undergo a Diels-Alder reaction with the cyclopentadiene derivative. 

But wait, our diene here is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. If the cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, then the Diels-Alder reaction would proceed. However, such a diene with four methyl groups would be quite bulky. The react

Let's approach this problem methodically. First, I'll analyze the information we have.

We're dealing with a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene that undergoes dehydration to form an anhydride. The anhydride's spectroscopic data includes a 1H NMR showing a single peak at 7 ppm, while the 13C NMR displays two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. This anhydride subsequently reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, yielding two products (major and minor) with identical molecular formulas: C13H16O3. Notably, the NOESY spectrum of the major product exhibits a cross-peak that is either absent or significantly weaker in the minor product. Our task is to determine which two proton resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

Let's examine the anhydride structure first. When a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene undergoes dehydration, it typically forms a cyclic anhydride if structurally feasible. For example, maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) forms maleic anhydride through dehydration. In our case, the dicarboxylic acid with its cis double bond would likely form a five-membered cyclic anhydride.

Looking at the anhydride's NMR data: the single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR suggests equivalent protons with no splitting. In a structure like maleic anhydride, the two protons on the double bond would be equivalent due to molecular symmetry, resulting in a singlet. The 13C NMR shows peaks at 165 ppm (typical for anhydride carbonyl carbons) and 137 ppm (consistent with sp2 carbons in a double bond). The presence of just two peaks further supports a symmetric structure, where two carbonyl carbons are equivalent and two double bond carbons are equivalent. This evidence points toward a structure similar to maleic anhydride.

Maleic anhydride typically shows a 1H NMR singlet around 6.70 ppm for its two equivalent protons, which is reasonably close to the 7 ppm mentioned in our problem, considering potential variations due to solvent effects or substitution patterns.

Moving to the diene component: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Cyclopentadiene typically refers to a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds. The 1,3 designation indicates double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4 in the ring. With methyl groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, we have a tetramethyl-substituted cyclopentadiene.

When the anhydride reacts with this tetramethyl-cyclopentadiene, it's likely undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction, with the anhydride serving as the dienophile and the cyclopentadiene derivative as the diene. This reaction would produce Diels-Alder adducts with the formula C13H16O3.

Sure, let's address this problem methodically. First, we'll dissect the given information. 

We are dealing with a dicarboxylic acid featuring a cis-alkene that undergoes dehydration to form an anhydride. The NMR data for the anhydride shows: in 1H NMR, a single peak at 7 ppm, and in 13C NMR, there are two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. This anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, yielding two products (major and minor), each with the formula C13H16O3. A crucial point is that the NOESY spectrum of the major product reveals a cross-peak that is either weak or absent in the minor product. We need to identify which two resonances (protons) are linked by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, let's determine the anhydride's structure. When a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene is dehydrated, it typically forms a cyclic anhydride if the structure permits. As an example, maleic acid (cis-butenedioic acid) converts into maleic anhydride upon dehydration. If our acid has a similar cis double bond, the resulting anhydride would likely be a five-membered cyclic anhydride.

The NMR data for the anhydride indicates a 1H NMR single peak at 7 ppm, which is intriguing since maleic anhydride typically exhibits protons in a singlet, albeit usually around 6.2 ppm. However, the 13C NMR, with peaks at 137 and 165 ppm, supports an assignment of carbonyl groups (usually around 165-175 ppm) and possibly double bond carbons (around 137 ppm).

Maleic anhydride is a cyclic structure where double bonds exist between central carbons, with the carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen. The 1H NMR showing a singlet at 7 ppm suggests equivalent protons potentially due to molecular symmetry. Maleic anhydrideâs symmetry (mirror planes) can result in equivalent protons, thus producing a singlet in 1H NMR.

The 13C NMR showing peaks at 165 and 137 ppm implies two equivalent carbonyl carbons (165 ppm) and two equivalent double bond carbons (137 ppm) due to the moleculeâs symmetrical nature, confirming the anhydride is indeed maleic anhydride.

This maleic anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, a compound described as a cyclopentene ring with four methyl groups. This structure hints at a cyclopentadiene ring, possibly in a 1,3 configuration, conjugated similarly to cyclopentadiene.

In executing a Diels-Alder reaction with maleic anhydride, the diene in 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene partners with maleic anhydride (a classic dienophile) to form the products. The major product's NOESY spectrum suggests specific spatial proximities (indicating which protons are near each other), which could involve protons on the diene ring and the anhydride adduct.

By focusing beyond individual nomenclature complications and visualizing the reaction's mechanistics, we address that the major product involves protons near those previously found at the anhydride's and the dieneâs interacting sites. Identifying this spatial connection amidst equivalent protons helps elucidate the NOESY cross-peak pattern, distinguishing the major from the minor product in this synthesis roadmap.

Wait, the anhydride formed is (for maleic anhydride, which is (CH)2(CO)2O. So formula is C4H2O3. Then the diene: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Cyclopentadiene (C5H6) but with four methyl groups. Each methyl is -CH3. So replacing four H\'s with CH3. So formula would be C5H6 minus 4 H plus 4*(CH3) â C5 + 4*C = C9, H6 -4 + 12 = H14. So C9H14. The anhydride is C4H2O3. The product is C13H16O3. So when combined, C9H14 + C4H2O3 = C13H16O3. Therefore, the reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder reaction, adding the diene (4Ï) and the anhydride (dienophile, 2Ï) to form a six-membered adduct. Molecular formula adds up; the H count also: 14 from diene + 2 from anhydride =16, O is 3 from the anhydride. So yes, the reaction is Diels-Alder.\n\nSo the adduct formed is a bicyclic structure with the oxygen from the anhydride. The two products are the endo and exo adducts. The endo is usually the major product, but here, since the diene is very bulky (4 methyl groups), maybe the exo is more favorable due to less steric hindrance? But maybe not. Alternatively, the substituents could direct the endo effect. However, the problem states that there is a major and a minor product. The presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY for the major product suggests that certain protons are close in space (through space interaction) which are not in the minor. \n\nIn Diels-Alder adducts, endo transition state leads to the endo product where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are positioned on the same face as the diene. The maleic anhydride\'s ester groups would be on the endo side, resulting in stereochemistry where substituents from the dienophile are on the endo face. For the NOESY, the cross-peak would be between protons that are near each other in space. Thus, in the major product (endo), there might be proximity between an acyloxy group (from the anhydride) and a proton from the diene part. Possibly the bridgehead proton and a methyl group?\n\nWait, need to consider the structure. Let\'s imagine the Diels-Alder reaction: the diene is conjugated (let\'s assume it can act as a normal diene despite the substituents). The dienophile (anhydride) adds to the diene in a [4+2] fashion. The resulting adduct has a six-membered ring bicyclic structure. The substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride oxygen rings) would be at the bridgehead positions. The methyl groups from the diene (four methyl groups) are on the cyclopentene part. But wait, the diene is already part of a cyclopentadiene, so reacting with the dienophile (anhydride) would form a bicyclic structure. Let me try to sketch mentally.\n\nThe cyclopentadiene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-) acts as the diene. The dienophile is the anhydride. After cycloaddition, the six-membered ring is formed, with bridgeheads connecting to the oxygen atoms of the anhydride. Since we have four methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene, those are located around the cyclopentane (now part of the bicyclic system). The endo rule would position the bulky groups (the anhydride\'s oxygen substituents) adjacent to the bridgehead, but in a bicyclic system, maybe certain substituents end up in proximity. \n\nAlternatively, considering the diene is sterically crowded, the major product might avoid having substituents in crowded areas. The NOESY cross-peak in the major product could correspond to protons that are on the same face of the ring, i.e., cis protons. The minor product (possibly exo) might have these protons on opposite faces. For instance, suppose that in the endo transition state, a methyl group from the diene is adjacent to an oxygen substituent from the anhydride. When the adduct forms, this methyl group could be near a proton from the oxygen substituent (like a bridgehead proton) leading to cross-peak in NOESY. \n\nAlternatively, considering that maleic anhydride\'s structure gives two substituents (the oxygen atoms) in the adduct, these would form an ester-like bridge. The bridgehead would have protons adjacent to the oxygen atoms, and those protons might have an NOE interaction with nearby methyl groups from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene. \n\nWait, another angle: The NOESY cross-peak arises from spatial proximity between two protons. In the Diels-Alder adduct, there\'s a bicyclic system: say, a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure or similar. Let\'s consider the structure. The Diels-Alder adds to a cyclopentadiene ring to form a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure? Alternatively, a bicycle where the six-membered ring is formed from the diene and dienophile. For example, if the diene (cyclopentadiene part) contributes four carbons and the dienophile (anhydride) contributes two carbons, but I might need to think in terms of electron movement.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the maleic anhydride (dienophile) is a good electron-deficient dienophile. When it reacts with the cyclopentadiene (electron-rich due to the conjugated double bonds), the Diels-Alder forms a six-membered ring where two of the carbons come from the anhydride and four from the diene. The key here is the endo vs. exo transition state. In the endo transition state, the substituents of the dienophile are positioned under the forming Ï system of the diene, leading to the endo product.\n\nIn the endo product, the substituents (e.g., the oxygen atoms from the anhydride) are on the same face as the bulky methyl groups of the diene. Wait, but perhaps the methyl groups are positioned in such a way that in the endo product, a specific methyl group is near an oxygen atom or a bridgehead proton, whereas in the exo product, these groups are apart. \n\nThe 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene must have a specific arrangement of methyl groups. Let me imagine this diene. Suppose the cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4 positions (which would be conjugated), but with methyl groups on carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. That would actually lead to 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. But with two double bonds, a cumulative diene? That\'s a possibility, though perhaps strained. Or maybe a single double bond with adjacent substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it\'s a monoene with substituents. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it\'s a bicyclic diene. This part is a bit confusing, but perhaps I can proceed. Let\'s assume the Diels-Alder reaction forms a bridged bicyclic compound. The two products stem from different stereoisomerisms at the bridge. For instance, the maleic anhydride\'s two carbonyl groups can arrange either endo or exo with respect to the bridge, leading to different products. However, since maleic anhydride is symmetric, perhaps the products differ in the arrangement of substituents in the bicyclic system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycloaddition leads to a bridge where the substituents (methyl groups) from the diene and the oxygens from the anhydride are positioned either on the same or different faces. In the major product (endo), substituents on the dienophile would be on the same face as the end of the diene. NOESY cross-peaks can be between protons that are near each other in space. For example, a methyl group adjacent to the bridge might be close to the anhydride oxygen\'s neighboring protons. \n\nWait, the oxygen groups from the anhydride would end up as two substituents on the adduct. Maybe as an epoxide-like bridge. Let\'s recall that the Diels-Alder adduct of maleic anhydride with cyclopentadiene forms a six-membered ring oxabicyclic compound. If the anhydride forms an ester group in the adduct, then the structure has an ester bridge. \n\nWait, possibly the oxygens in the anhydride form an ester functional group adjacent to the bridgehead. So, in the product, there\'s a bridge with an ester oxygen, and the bicyclic system has methyl groups from the diene.\n\nAlternatively, stepping back. Let me check the NOESY cross-peak. The cross-peak is present in the major product (indicating proximity) and absent in the minor. In the major, we have two resonances connected. Which integrals? Wait, in the 1H NMR of the products, we can look at the integrals for the protons. Wait, the problem states: âintegrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMRâ. But they don\'t give the integrals. Wait, perhaps the cross-peak is between the methyl groups from the diene and protons from the anhydride-derived part of the molecule. For example, in the endo product, the methyl groups are closer to certain protons. \n\nIf the cycloadduct has a bridgehead where the oxygen is connected, and in the endo form, a methyl group from the diene is near a proton adjacent to oxygen (like CH2O or CHO group). However, in the problem description, the anhydride\'s 1H NMR had a single peak at 7 ppm, which after the Diels-Alder reaction would lose the alkene protons (since the double bond from the anhydride is opened up). However, the original maleic anhydride\'s protons at 7 ppm (as per problem) would in the product be gone, replaced by new protons. However, in the adduct, there might be new protons near the oxygen. So the possible cross-peak in NOESY of the major product could be between a methyl group (from the diene part) and a proton on the bridge (from the anhydride part).\n\nAlternatively, looking at the anhydride\'s original dienophile structure, which has the single peak at 7 ppm from the alkene protons. After reaction, these protons are part of the six-membered adduct, in positions where they could be close to methyl groups from the diene. Wait, but in a Diels-Alder adduct, the diene\'s back two carbons (the ones that become the "back" of the bicyclic system) have substituents, while the front two (from the dienophile) form the new single bonds. So, for example, maleic anhydride has two CH groups (with the protons at 7 ppm) that would become part of the bicyclic bridge. These protons might end up adjacent to the methyl groups from the original diene. If in the endo adduct, those protons are in proximity to certain methyl groups, that would result in the NOESY cross-peak. In the exo adduct, these protons are farther away, leading to no cross-peak.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the tetramethyl substituents on the diene are in positions such that, in the adduct, one of the methyl groups is directed towards the bridgehead, and the other towards the periphery. The endo transition state would place the substituents of the dienophile (the anhydride oxygens) near the bulky substituents of the diene. So in the endo product, the oxygen\'s protons (if any) would be near the methyl groups.\n\nWait, but the anhydride doesn\'t have protons on the oxygen atoms. The problem said the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR, which we determined is the two equivalent protons from the alkene. After the Diels-Alder reaction, those protons become part of the new sigma bonds, so now those H\'s would be singlets in the productâs NMR? Wait, no. The Diels-Alder reaction opens the dienophile\'s double bond into the six-membered transition state. Those original protons (at 7 ppm) would no longer be present as the carbons are now single bonds. Therefore, new positions would have protons. The adduct\'s structure would then have substituted cyclohexene, but with the bridged oxygen atoms.\n\nBut perhaps the novel proton environments in the adduct would have protons at different positions. For example, the bridgehead protons (if any) or the methine protons adjacent to the oxygen atoms.\n\nLet me consider a specific example. Taking maleic anhydride and reacting with 1,3-cyclopentadiene (without methyl groups). The adduct would be bicyclo[2.2.1] structure with the oxygen bridges. The endo product would have the oxygens on the same face as the six-membered transition state. In the Diels-Alder of maleic anhydride and cyclopentadiene, the endo product has the oxygen atoms pointing towards the interior of the bicyclic structure. If we now have a tetramethyl cyclopentadiene, the substituents would affect the transition state. Methyl groups on the diene would be electron-donating and could lead to preference for endo or exo.\n\nAssuming the major product is endo, in which the oxygens are inside the convex face of the bicyclic structure, then a methyl group from the diene (which is part of the bicyclic system now) might be close to a proton from the dienophile-derived bridge. For example, the bridgehead methine (CH groups) could be near one of the methyl groups. If such proximity exists in the endo, then the NOESY would show a cross-peak between those protons.\n\nBut in the minor product (exo), the oxygens are on the opposite face, so that methyl group and the bridgehead proton are on different faces, leading to no cross-peak.\n\nSpecifically, let\'s say in the major product (endo), a bridgehead proton (H_a) and a methyl group (from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene part) are on the same side of the ring, so their 1H NMR signals would show an NOE effect. In the 1H NMR of the product, there would be different signals for H_a and the methyl groups. However, the exact assignments would require knowledge of the NMR shifts.\n\nBut according to the problem, the cross-peak in NOESY of the major product is between two resonances. The \'integrals\' from the 1H NMR might suggest the number of protons in each peak. For example, a singlet (from a single proton) and a multiplet (from another). But the problem states that the anhydride\'s 1H NMR had a single peak (so two equivalent protons) at 7 ppm. After reaction, if those protons become equivalent in a different environment, perhaps shifted upfield or downfield.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the adduct, the bridgehead protons (which were the original protons of the anhydride\'s double bond) are now in a different chemical environment and could be split into different signals. If the endo product has a bridgehead proton that is near a methyl group (from the diene), that would lead to a cross-peak. If H_a is adjacent to the methyl, then the cross-peak connects H_a\'s resonance with the methyl protons. \n\nThe minor product (exo) would have H_a away from the methyl, so no cross-peak.\n\nGiven that the methyl groups from the diene are likely as singlets in the 1H NMR (since tetramethyl groups could be equivalent if symmetry is high). But in reality, with four methyl groups attached to the cyclopentadiene, they might not all be equivalent. But the problem says both products have C13H16O3. Let me check: diene is C9H14 (four methyl: 4*C + 5 carbons from cyclopentadiene minus some hydrogens? Wait, earlier calculation said cyclopentadiene would have C5H6 plus four methyl groups (C9H14). Then anhydride C4H2O3. Combined C13H16O3. The product is likely bicyclic with some oxygen bridges.\n\nBut, the problem is asking which two resonances in the major product\'s 1H NMR are connected. So the answer is likely between a methyl group (from the diene) and a proton adjacent to the oxygen (from the anhydride), such as an axial proton in the bicyclic structure. For example, if the minor product has these groups trans (so no NOE), while the major has them cis (showing NOE). \n\nAlternatively, in the major product, there might be a H and a methyl in a gauche or adjacent position, giving an NOE effect, while in the minor, they are opposite. If the anhydride\'s bridge positions lead to proximity between a methyl and a specific proton in the endo case.\n\nAssuming the methyl groups from the diene are at very shielded positions, perhaps as singlets around 1 ppm (typical for methyl), and the adjacent proton could be around 3-5 ppm, or maybe deshielded methylene protons. Alternatively, perhaps the NOE is between two different methyl groups. However, the problem states that the cross-peak is absent or weak in the minor. That suggests a spatial proximity that\'s present only in the major product.\n\nTo summarize: \n- The major product (endo) has a proximity between a methyl group and a bridgehead proton from the anhydride part. \n- In the minor product (exo), this proximity does not exist.\n- The cross-peak in the NOESY of the major product corresponds to these two protons.\n\nGiven the 1H NMR integrals, which are not provided, but often methyl groups are triplets or singlets, while protons adjacent to oxygen (bridgehead) might show up as singlets or multiplets. However, the key is which two protons in the product structure would have proximity only in the major product.\n\nAnother consideration is the planar structure and the stereochemistry. Suppose the major product positions two groups (like a methyl and a proton) on the same face, leading to NOE. In the minor, they are opposite. For example, in the major product, the CH from the dienophile (formerly at 7 ppm) and a methyl from the diene are cis, leading to proximity, hence a cross-peak. In the minor, trans arrangement makes them distant. So those two protons\' resonances would be linked.\n\nBut since the problem only asks for which resonances are connected in the major product, likely methyl and a proton adjacent to the carbonyl group. Or perhaps a bridgehead methine and a methyl.\n\nAssuming the original protons from the anhydride\'s double bond (which were a singlet at 7 ppm in the anhydride) get converted into two new single protons (equivalent in the case of endo, but maybe split in exo). However, given the symmetry, the major product might have equivalent protons here, but that\'s not necessarily the case. The Diels-Alder reaction forms two new stereocenters. For maleic anhydride and a symmetrical diene, the adduct could retain some symmetry. But with four methyl groups on the diene, possibly lower symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure has two epimeric forms (endo and exo), where the methyl group\'s position relative to the bridgehead varies. In the endo, the methyl and bridgehead H are close, resulting in NOESY cross-peak. In exo, not.\n\nIf the bridgehead H is at, say, Î´ 5 ppm (due to oxygen proximity) and the methyl groups at Î´ 1.5 ppm, the cross-peak would link these. But without specific shifts, we need to infer based on typical assignment.\n\nWait, consider actual Diels-Alder adducts of maleic anhydride. The protons adjacent to the oxygen and carbonyl groups can be in a different chemical environment, usually around Î´ 5-6 ppm. Methyl groups are usually around Î´ 1-1.5 ppm. If in the major product, the endo arrangement brings a bridgehead proton near a methyl group, then the NOE would connect Î´ 5.xx (bridgehead H) and Î´ 1.xx (methyl). But again, specifics vary.\n\nAlternatively, maleic anhydride\'s protons (s at 7 ppm) disappear in adduct. In the adduct, new protons should appear. For example, in the Diels-Alder adduct of maleic anhydride and cyclopentadiene, there are protons that were part of the dienophile\'s double bond. These would be in the bridged structure. For example, the two CH groups that participated in the cycloaddition would now be part of the bridge. So their protons may experience different shifts, perhaps Î´ 3-5 ppm depending on the structure.\n\nIf those bridge protons are close to methyl groups from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene in the endo product, their cross-peak would be in NOESY. For example, if a bridge CH2 group (if present) is near a methyl, or CH near a methyl.\n\nI think the answer they are looking for relates to the endo rule where substituents on the dienophile (anhydride) are on the same face as the end of the diene. In the endo product (major), there is a spatial proximity between substituents of the dienophile (anhydride) and the diene\'s substituents (methyl groups). Thus, in the NOESY, a proton from the anhydride-derived part (probably a bridgehead H) and a methyl group from the diene would show a cross-peak. Since the problem states that the answer should be which two resonances (from 1H NMR integrals), most likely a proton adjacent to the oxygen (bridgehead, possibly a CH group) nearby a methyl group. The answer should thus mention the two resonances corresponding to these protons.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the original anhydride\'s alkene gives rise to a particular structure, maybe the ring-opening positions generate a pair of bis-ester groups, with protons that are adjacent to the methyl groups.\n\nGiven that maleic anhydride\'s Diels-Alder with cyclopentadiene forms bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride. In the endo form, the ester oxygens are inside the bicyclic system. So a possible arrangement where a bridgehead proton is near a methyl group from the tetramethyl substituted cyclopentadiene. Therefore, in the NOESY, a bridgehead proton would show a cross-peak with the methyl group\'s resonance.\n\n Alternatively, consider that in the major product, there\'s a chair-like structure where the two substituents are axial leading to proximity, but I can\'t be sure.\n\nConsidering all this, the most probable cross-peak in the major product is between a methyl group (from the diene) and a proton adjacent to the carbonyl group (from the anhydride).\n\nBut unfortunately, without specific assignments, this is somewhat speculative. However, the textbook-like answer would likely be that the cross-peak is between the bridgehead proton (from the anhydride part) and one of the methyl groups from the diene part, present in the endo major product but not in the exo minor product. Given the question mentions "integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR," but without specific integral values, I think the answer involves identifying two key protons based on their position in the molecule. Given the anhydride-derived protons were at 7 ppm originally, after reaction they would be part of the bridged structure and may now appear differently, but they would no longer be in an alkene. So the likely cross-peak is between a methyl group (e.g., singlet integrating to 3H) and another proton (maybe an OCH group, integrating to 1H).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the protons from the carbonyl-adjacent CH groups in the anhydride survive as two protons in the product. These could now be near the methyl groups. SO two protons that used to be at 7 ppm, now as different shifts (say, around 3-4 ppm) with geminal coupling or neighboring, being next to oxygen, and having an NOE with the methyl group. But in the anhydride part of the structure.\n\nTo conclude, the major product\'s cross-peak in NOESY would be between a proton adjacent to anhydride-derived oxygens (like a bridgehead proton) and a methyl group from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene. For names, probably the methyl group at position 2 or 3 (adjacent to the bridge) and the bridgehead H.\n\nIt\'s a bit challenging without the actual chemical structure, but based on the reasoning, the answer is likely a cross-peak between the methyl group resonance and a resonance from a proton near the oxygen (bridgehead). In the absence of specific shifts, the mention of the proton that was originally in the olefinic position (7 ppm) might now appear lower in Î´ or higher, but interaction with methyl. But according to the data given, the original 7 ppm proton became a different proton.\n\nAlternately, let\'s suppose the major product\'s cross-peak is between two axially positioned protons. Alternatively, the cross-peak is between a methyl resonance and a vinyl proton, but the Diels-Alder would eliminate the original anhydride\'s double bond. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Diels-Alder adduct retains a double bond (for which protons could now be new). But maleic anhydride cycloadduct would convert the original trans double bond into a six-membered ring, creating two new chiral centers and no double bond in the product? Wait, no. Diels-Alder reaction produces the six-membered ring with a trans stereochemistry in the fused ring but typically the adduct has a single s-cis dienophile. Wait, perhaps the adduct has a cyclohexene-like ring, but I\'m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that after the Diels-Alder reaction, the original double bond from the dienophile (anhydride) becomes a single bond. The new six-membered ring (formed from the [4+2] addition) would have conjugated substituents but no double bond. All double bonds are from the diene, which in the reaction become single bonds. The positions where the double bond in diene was are now single bonds in the adduct.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Hence, to sum up:\n\nThe cross-peak in the major product likely connects a methyl resonance with a bridgehead proton. The answer should indicate that the two resonances belong to the methyl groups (likely 1.5 ppm area) and the bridgehead proton (say, 3-4 ppm). However, the problem states "integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR," probably indicating the multiplicity and integral (number of protons) for each peak. Methyl groups typically integrate to 3H each. If the major product has a cross-peak between, say, a triplet representing a CH2 group and a methyl group, but no such info is given.\n\nAlternatively, the cross-peak involves two protons within the ring that differ in the products. Given the lack of specific data, possibly the answer is a methyl group and an oxymethine proton.\n\nAnother Perspective:\n\nThe anhydride maleic anhydride dimerizes to the Diels-Alder adduct. Wait, no. Maybe after the Diels-Alder reaction with the tetramethylcyclopentadiene, the product\'s structure has an axial vs. equatorial positioning of substituents, leading to different NOE interactions.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the cyclopentadiene part, due to the four methyl groups, there are specific stretches of the ring with high substitution. In the endo product, the two groups from the dienophile (O and O) are near the more substitution (the methyl-rich part of the diene). This proximity in space could be evaluated.\n\nBut honestly, perhaps the answer is that the cross-peak is between two methyl groups. However, since the diene has four methyl groups, it\'s more likely that only two are adjacent.\n\nWait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. Therefore, on a five-membered ring, adjacent methyl groups: 1,2,3,4. So positions 1 and 2 are methyl, 3 and 4 are also methyl. But the four methyl groups must be placed in such a way that the diene is in the 1 and 3 positions? Or 1 and 3 positions have the double bonds.\n\nBut this level of structural analysis might be too tedious. Given that time is a constraint, perhaps the answer intended here is that the cross-peak is between the protons from the endo-anhydride-derived methyl group and the cyclopentadiene-bridge proton, but I think the safest answer based on standard Diels-Alder\'s endo rule and NOESY would be between the endo proton (near the dienophileâs substituents) and a proton from the dieneâs substituents. Given that, probably the protons in question are a methyl group (from the diene) and a bridgehead proton (from the anhydride), spatially close in the endo product but not in the exo.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe cross-peak in the major productâs NOESY spectrum connects the methyl groups and the bridgehead protons. The specific resonances are the \\boxed{\\text{methyl protons and the vinylic protons}}.\n\nWait, no. The problem mentions that the anhydride\'s original protons were at 7 ppm. After Diels-Alder, those protons are no longer vinylic. Maybe the problem expects that the methyl groups from the cyclopentadiene (which will have certain 1H shifts) has a cross-peak with the endo proton (which was originally part of the anhydride\'s protons, so now at bridgehead). Given that original protons were at 7 ppm (singlet), after the reaction, the bridgehead proton might be at say 4 ppm and use integrals (multiplets for one proton). According to the question, the answer should indicate two resonances, such as a methyl signal and a signal from a CH group. \n\nAlternatively, recognizing that the endo product would have the dienophile\'s substituent (an exo-O) near the substituents of the diene, perhaps causing an NOE between an oxygenated methyl (if any) and another proton. Wait, no methyl is oxygenated here. All methyls are from cyclopentadiene.\n\n\nMaybe The answer is the two methyl groups that are cis to each other. NO, all four methyls are on the diene. Given that they are in 1,2,3,4 positions, likely adjacent. In the endo product, two of the methyl groups are in proximity, while in exo they aren\'t. But that would lead to a cross-peak between two methyl signals. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl next to the carbonyl in the endo is closer. \n\n Alternatively, think of it as follows:\n\nThe maleic anhydride forms a bridge in the adduct. In the endo product, the bridge looks like O=C-O-crosslink. There, a methyl group from the capsicum part (diene part) is next to the oxygen bridge. In such case, the protons nearby the oxygen (on the bridge) sense the methyl group, resulting in a NOESY cross-peak. In the exo product, this proximity is absent. \n\nIf the bridge has protons (like a CH2 group), then the H\'s on CH2 would be near the methyl in endo, leading to cross-peak. But since original anhydride has a maleic structure, the bridge may be ester-like, O-C-O, so not having protons. So, perhaps a bridgehead with CH-O. If the bridgehead is a quaternary carbon, there are no protons. Therefore, another possibility, but perhaps the regiochemistry and nuclear here.\n\n\nAfter some research, the major product in a Diels Alder reaction of a symmetric dienophile like maleic anhydride with a sterically hindered diene is the endo product where the substituents of the dienophile are syn to the newly formed bridged ring system. Thus, in the major product (endo), the two oxygen atoms from the anhydride would be on the same side as the bulky methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene moiety. This would create spatial proximity between certain methyl groups and the anhydride-derived oxygens. However, since the oxygens are not protonated, the NOESY cross-peak must involve nearby protons. But wait, oxygen is not proton here, so the cross-peak must be between protons adjacent to the oxygens,ä¹è¨± adjacent to oxygen are bridgehead protons. For instance, if the bridge is a five-membered ring with oxygen atoms, then there could be bridgehead protons. If in the major product, these bridgehead protons are closer to the diene\'s methyl groups than in the minor product, then the cross-peak would be between the bridgehead protons and methyl protons.\n\nGiven that both products are formed but the major has this spatial proximity, therefore in the 1H NMR, the bridgehead protons (chiral centers resulting from the Diels-Alder adduct) would resonate at a specific shift, while the methyl protons (eightmethyl groups perhaps, but probably integrating individually) would resound elsewhere. Due to the sheer number of methyl groups (a total of four), how would they integrate. However, the possible cross-peak is between a "bridgehead" H (say, two protons each integrated as 1H) and a methyl group (integrated as 3H or maybe 6H if two equivalent methyls).\n\nGiven that the answer choices probably want specific relations, the boxed answer would likely connect the methyl group and the bridgehead proton. For example, perhaps the bridgehead H (say, H8 is near Me-2). However, given no data, traditionally, this cross-peak is between the endo methyl and endo bridgehead proton. Therefore,\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\text{A methyl group and the bridgehead proton}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743846587, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7935, prompt_tokens=3013, total_tokens=10948, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves the reaction of a cis-dicarboxylic acid anhydride with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to form two products (major and minor) with molecular formula C13H16O3. The key task is to determine which two resonances in the major product's 1H NMR spectrum are connected by a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum, which is absent or weak in the minor product.

1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:
   - The anhydride is derived from a cis-dicarboxylic acid, leading to a symmetric cyclic anhydride (analogous to maleic anhydride).
   - The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm (equivalent protons on the double bond) and 13C NMR peaks at 137 ppm (spÂ² carbons) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbons).

2. **Reaction with 1,2,3,4-Tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene**:
   - The reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction where the anhydride acts as the dienophile.
   - The products are formed via endo (major) and exo (minor) transition states. The endo product follows the endo rule, placing substituents from the dienophile (anhydride) and diene (tetramethyl-cyclopentadiene) on the same face.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak Analysis**:
   - The cross-peak in the major product (endo) indicates spatial proximity between two protons.
   - In the endo product, the methyl groups from the diene are close to the bridgehead protons from the anhydride-derived structure.
   - This proximity is absent in the exo product (minor), leading to no or a weak cross-peak.

4. **Identification of Resonances**:
   - The major product's NOESY cross-peak connects the methyl groups from the tetramethyl-cyclopentadiene and the bridgehead protons adjacent to the oxygen atoms from the anhydride.

 and yield two products: major and minor. The Diels-Alder reaction gives the endo product as major (endo rule). But maybe in this case, steric effects could lead to a different outcome. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not Diels-Alder but something else. However, since the products have the same molecular formula as the combination of anhydride and diene. Let's check molecular formula. The anhydride from a dicarboxylic acid: assuming the dicarboxylic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH (but that's not with a cis-alkene). Wait, the anhydride formed is (for maleic anhydride, which is (CH)2(CO)2O. So formula is C4H2O3. Then the diene: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Cyclopentadiene (C5H6) but with four methyl groups. Each methyl is -CH3. So replacing four H's with CH3. So formula would be C5H6 minus 4 H plus 4*(CH3) â C5 + 4*C = C9, H6 -4 + 12 = H14. So C9H14. The anhydride is C4H2O3. The product is C13H16O3. So when combined, C9H14 + C4H2O3 = C13H16O3. Therefore, the reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder reaction, adding the diene (4Ï) and the anhydride (dienophile, 2Ï) to form a six-membered adduct. Molecular formula adds up; the H count also: 14 from diene + 2 from anhydride =16, O is 3 from the anhydride. So yes, the reaction is Diels-Alder.

So the adduct formed is a bicyclic structure with the oxygen from the anhydride. The two products are the endo and exo adducts. The endo is usually the major product, but here, since the diene is very bulky (4 methyl groups), maybe the exo is more favorable due to less steric hindrance? But maybe not. Alternatively, the substituents could direct the endo effect. However, the problem states that there is a major and a minor product. The presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY for the major product suggests that certain protons are close in space (through space interaction) which are not in the minor. 

In Diels-Alder adducts, endo transition state leads to the endo product where the electron-withdrawing groups of the dienophile are positioned on the same face as the diene. The maleic anhydride's ester groups would be on the endo side, resulting in stereochemistry where substituents from the dienophile are on the endo face. For the NOESY, the cross-peak would be between protons that are near each other in space. Thus, in the major product (endo), there might be proximity between an acyloxy group (from the anhydride) and a proton from the diene part. Possibly the bridgehead proton and a methyl group?

Wait, need to consider the structure. Let's imagine the Diels-Alder reaction: the diene is conjugated (let's assume it can act as a normal diene despite the substituents). The dienophile (anhydride) adds to the diene in a [4+2] fashion. The resulting adduct has a six-membered ring bicyclic structure. The substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride oxygen rings) would be at the bridgehead positions. The methyl groups from the diene (four methyl groups) are on the cyclopentene part. But wait, the diene is already part of a cyclopentadiene, so reacting with the dienophile (anhydride) would form a bicyclic structure. Let me try to sketch mentally.

The cyclopentadiene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-) acts as the diene. The dienophile is the anhydride. After cycloaddition, the six-membered ring is formed, with bridgeheads connecting to the oxygen atoms of the anhydride. Since we have four methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene, those are located around the cyclopentane (now part of the bicyclic system). The endo rule would position the bulky groups (the anhydride's oxygen substituents) adjacent to the bridgehead, but in a bicyclic system, maybe certain substituents end up in proximity. 

Alternatively, considering the diene is sterically crowded, the major product might avoid having substituents in crowded areas. The NOESY cross-peak in the major product could correspond to protons that are on the same face of the ring, i.e., cis protons. The minor product (possibly exo) might have these protons on opposite faces. For instance, suppose that in the endo transition state, a methyl group from the diene is adjacent to an oxygen substituent from the anhydride. When the adduct forms, this methyl group could be near a proton from the oxygen substituent (like a bridgehead proton) leading to cross-peak in NOESY. 

Alternatively, considering that maleic anhydride's structure gives two substituents (the oxygen atoms) in the adduct, these would form an ester-like bridge. The bridgehead would have protons adjacent to the oxygen atoms, and those protons might have an NOE interaction with nearby methyl groups from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene. 

Wait, another angle: The NOESY cross-peak arises from spatial proximity between two protons. In the Diels-Alder adduct, there's a bicyclic system: say, a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure or similar. Let's consider the structure. The Diels-Alder adds to a cyclopentadiene ring to form a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure? Alternatively, a bicycle where the six-membered ring is formed from the diene and dienophile. For example, if the diene (cyclopentadiene part) contributes four carbons and the dienophile (anhydride) contributes two carbons, but I might need to think in terms of electron movement.

Alternatively, consider that the maleic anhydride (dienophile) is a good electron-deficient dienophile. When it reacts with the cyclopentadiene (electron-rich due to the conjugated double bonds), the Diels-Alder forms a six-membered ring where two of the carbons come from the anhydride and four from the diene. The key here is the endo vs. exo transition state. In the endo transition state, the substituents of the dienophile are positioned under the forming Ï system of the diene, leading to the endo product.

In the endo product, the substituents (e.g., the oxygen atoms from the anhydride) are on the same face as the bulky methyl groups of the diene. Wait, but perhaps the methyl groups are positioned in such a way that in the endo product, a specific methyl group is near an oxygen atom or a bridgehead proton, whereas in the exo product, these groups are apart. 

The 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene must have a specific arrangement of methyl groups. Let me imagine this diene. Suppose the cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4 positions (which would be conjugated), but with methyl groups on carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4. That would actually lead to 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. But with two double bonds, a cumulative diene? That's a possibility, though perhaps strained. Or maybe a single double bond with adjacent substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a monoene with substituents. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclic diene. This part is a bit confusing, but perhaps I can proceed. Let's assume the Diels-Alder reaction forms a bridged bicyclic compound. The two products stem from different stereoisomerisms at the bridge. For instance, the maleic anhydride's two carbonyl groups can arrange either endo or exo with respect to the bridge, leading to different products. However, since maleic anhydride is symmetric, perhaps the products differ in the arrangement of substituents in the bicyclic system.

Alternatively, perhaps the cycloaddition leads to a bridge where the substituents (methyl groups) from the diene and the oxygens from the anhydride are positioned either on the same or different faces. In the major product (endo), substituents on the dienophile would be on the same face as the end of the diene. NOESY cross-peaks can be between protons that are near each other in space. For example, a methyl group adjacent to the bridge might be close to the anhydride oxygen's neighboring protons. 

Wait, the oxygen groups from the anhydride would end up as two substituents on the adduct. Maybe as an epoxide-like bridge. Let's recall that the Diels-Alder adduct of maleic anhydride with cyclopentadiene forms a six-membered ring oxabicyclic compound. If the anhydride forms an ester group in the adduct, then the structure has an ester bridge. 

Wait, possibly the oxygens in the anhydride form an ester functional group adjacent to the bridgehead. So, in the product, there's a bridge with an ester oxygen, and the bicyclic system has methyl groups from the diene.

Alternatively, stepping back. Let me check the NOESY cross-peak. The cross-peak is present in the major product (indicating proximity) and absent in the minor. In the major, we have two resonances connected. Which integrals? Wait, in the 1H NMR of the products, we can look at the integrals for the protons. Wait, the problem states: âintegrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMRâ. But they don't give the integrals. Wait, perhaps the cross-peak is between the methyl groups from the diene and protons from the anhydride-derived part of the molecule. For example, in the endo product, the methyl groups are closer to certain protons. 

If the cycloadduct has a bridgehead where the oxygen is connected, and in the endo form, a methyl group from the diene is near a proton adjacent to oxygen (like CH2O or CHO group). However, in the problem description, the anhydride's 1H NMR had a single peak at 7 ppm, which after the Diels-Alder reaction would lose the alkene protons (since the double bond from the anhydride is opened up). However, the original maleic anhydride's protons at 7 ppm (as per problem) would in the product be gone, replaced by new protons. However, in the adduct, there might be new protons near the oxygen. So the possible cross-peak in NOESY of the major product could be between a methyl group (from the diene part) and a proton on the bridge (from the anhydride part).

Alternatively, looking at the anhydride's original dienophile structure, which has the single peak at 7 ppm from the alkene protons. After reaction, these protons are part of the six-membered adduct, in positions where they could be close to methyl groups from the diene. Wait, but in a Diels-Alder adduct, the diene's back two carbons (the ones that become the "back" of the bicyclic system) have substituents, while the front two (from the dienophile) form the new single bonds. So, for example, maleic anhydride has two CH groups (with the protons at 7 ppm) that would become part of the bicyclic bridge. These protons might end up adjacent to the methyl groups from the original diene. If in the endo adduct, those protons are in proximity to certain methyl groups, that would result in the NOESY cross-peak. In the exo adduct, these protons are farther away, leading to no cross-peak.

Alternatively, considering that the tetramethyl substituents on the diene are in positions such that, in the adduct, one of the methyl groups is directed towards the bridgehead, and the other towards the periphery. The endo transition state would place the substituents of the dienophile (the anhydride oxygens) near the bulky substituents of the diene. So in the endo product, the oxygen's protons (if any) would be near the methyl groups.

Wait, but the anhydride doesn't have protons on the oxygen atoms. The problem said the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR, which we determined is the two equivalent protons from the alkene. After the Diels-Alder reaction, those protons become part of the new sigma bonds, so now those H's would be singlets in the productâs NMR? Wait, no. The Diels-Alder reaction opens the dienophile's double bond into the six-membered transition state. Those original protons (at 7 ppm) would no longer be present as the carbons are now single bonds. Therefore, new positions would have protons. The adduct's structure would then have substituted cyclohexene, but with the bridged oxygen atoms.

But perhaps the novel proton environments in the adduct would have protons at different positions. For example, the bridgehead protons (if any) or the methine protons adjacent to the oxygen atoms.

Let me consider a specific example. Taking maleic anhydride and reacting with 1,3-cyclopentadiene (without methyl groups). The adduct would be bicyclo[2.2.1] structure with the oxygen bridges. The endo product would have the oxygens on the same face as the six-membered transition state. In the Diels-Alder of maleic anhydride and cyclopentadiene, the endo product has the oxygen atoms pointing towards the interior of the bicyclic structure. If we now have a tetramethyl cyclopentadiene, the substituents would affect the transition state. Methyl groups on the diene would be electron-donating and could lead to preference for endo or exo.

Assuming the major product is endo, in which the oxygens are inside the convex face of the bicyclic structure, then a methyl group from the diene (which is part of the bicyclic system now) might be close to a proton from the dienophile-derived bridge. For example, the bridgehead methine (CH groups) could be near one of the methyl groups. If such proximity exists in the endo, then the NOESY would show a cross-peak between those protons.

But in the minor product (exo), the oxygens are on the opposite face, so that methyl group and the bridgehead proton are on different faces, leading to no cross-peak.

Specifically, let's say in the major product (endo), a bridgehead proton (H_a) and a methyl group (from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene part) are on the same side of the ring, so their 1H NMR signals would show an NOE effect. In the 1H NMR of the product, there would be different signals for H_a and the methyl groups. However, the exact assignments would require knowledge of the NMR shifts.

But according to the problem, the cross-peak in NOESY of the major product is between two resonances. The 'integrals' from the 1H NMR might suggest the number of protons in each peak. For example, a singlet (from a single proton) and a multiplet (from another). But the problem states that the anhydride's 1H NMR had a single peak (so two equivalent protons) at 7 ppm. After reaction, if those protons become equivalent in a different environment, perhaps shifted upfield or downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps in the adduct, the bridgehead protons (which were the original protons of the anhydride's double bond) are now in a different chemical environment and could be split into different signals. If the endo product has a bridgehead proton that is near a methyl group (from the diene), that would lead to a cross-peak. If H_a is adjacent to the methyl, then the cross-peak connects H_a's resonance with the methyl protons. 

The minor product (exo) would have H_a away from the methyl, so no cross-peak.

Given that the methyl groups from the diene are likely as singlets in the 1H NMR (since tetramethyl groups could be equivalent if symmetry is high). But in reality, with four methyl groups attached to the cyclopentadiene, they might not all be equivalent. But the problem says both products have C13H16O3. Let me check: diene is C9H14 (four methyl: 4*C + 5 carbons from cyclopentadiene minus some hydrogens? Wait, earlier calculation said cyclopentadiene would have C5H6 plus four methyl groups (C9H14). Then anhydride C4H2O3. Combined C13H16O3. The product is likely bicyclic with some oxygen bridges.

But, the problem is asking which two resonances in the major product's 1H NMR are connected. So the answer is likely between a methyl group (from the diene) and a proton adjacent to the oxygen (from the anhydride), such as an axial proton in the bicyclic structure. For example, if the minor product has these groups trans (so no NOE), while the major has them cis (showing NOE). 

Alternatively, in the major product, there might be a H and a methyl in a gauche or adjacent position, giving an NOE effect, while in the minor, they are opposite. If the anhydride's bridge positions lead to proximity between a methyl and a specific proton in the endo case.

Assuming the methyl groups from the diene are at very shielded positions, perhaps as singlets around 1 ppm (typical for methyl), and the adjacent proton could be around 3-5 ppm, or maybe deshielded methylene protons. Alternatively, perhaps the NOE is between two different methyl groups. However, the problem states that the cross-peak is absent or weak in the minor. That suggests a spatial proximity that's present only in the major product.

To summarize: 
- The major product (endo) has a proximity between a methyl group and a bridgehead proton from the anhydride part. 
- In the minor product (exo), this proximity does not exist.
- The cross-peak in the NOESY of the major product corresponds to these two protons.

Given the 1H NMR integrals, which are not provided, but often methyl groups are triplets or singlets, while protons adjacent to oxygen (bridgehead) might show up as singlets or multiplets. However, the key is which two protons in the product structure would have proximity only in the major product.

Another consideration is the planar structure and the stereochemistry. Suppose the major product positions two groups (like a methyl and a proton) on the same face, leading to NOE. In the minor, they are opposite. For example, in the major product, the CH from the dienophile (formerly at 7 ppm) and a methyl from the diene are cis, leading to proximity, hence a cross-peak. In the minor, trans arrangement makes them distant. So those two protons' resonances would be linked.

But since the problem only asks for which resonances are connected in the major product, likely methyl and a proton adjacent to the carbonyl group. Or perhaps a bridgehead methine and a methyl.

Assuming the original protons from the anhydride's double bond (which were a singlet at 7 ppm in the anhydride) get converted into two new single protons (equivalent in the case of endo, but maybe split in exo). However, given the symmetry, the major product might have equivalent protons here, but that's not necessarily the case. The Diels-Alder reaction forms two new stereocenters. For maleic anhydride and a symmetrical diene, the adduct could retain some symmetry. But with four methyl groups on the diene, possibly lower symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has two epimeric forms (endo and exo), where the methyl group's position relative to the bridgehead varies. In the endo, the methyl and bridgehead H are close, resulting in NOESY cross-peak. In exo, not.

If the bridgehead H is at, say, Î´ 5 ppm (due to oxygen proximity) and the methyl groups at Î´ 1.5 ppm, the cross-peak would link these. But without specific shifts, we need to infer based on typical assignment.

Wait, consider actual Diels-Alder adducts of maleic anhydride. The protons adjacent to the oxygen and carbonyl groups can be in a different chemical environment, usually around Î´ 5-6 ppm. Methyl groups are usually around Î´ 1-1.5 ppm. If in the major product, the endo arrangement brings a bridgehead proton near a methyl group, then the NOE would connect Î´ 5.xx (bridgehead H) and Î´ 1.xx (methyl). But again, specifics vary.

Alternatively, maleic anhydride's protons (s at 7 ppm) disappear in adduct. In the adduct, new protons should appear. For example, in the Diels-Alder adduct of maleic anhydride and cyclopentadiene, there are protons that were part of the dienophile's double bond. These would be in the bridged structure. For example, the two CH groups that participated in the cycloaddition would now be part of the bridge. So their protons may experience different shifts, perhaps Î´ 3-5 ppm depending on the structure.

If those bridge protons are close to methyl groups from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene in the endo product, their cross-peak would be in NOESY. For example, if a bridge CH2 group (if present) is near a methyl, or CH near a methyl.

I think the answer they are looking for relates to the endo rule where substituents on the dienophile (anhydride) are on the same face as the end of the diene. In the endo product (major), there is a spatial proximity between substituents of the dienophile (anhydride) and the diene's substituents (methyl groups). Thus, in the NOESY, a proton from the anhydride-derived part (probably a bridgehead H) and a methyl group from the diene would show a cross-peak. Since the problem states that the answer should be which two resonances (from 1H NMR integrals), most likely a proton adjacent to the oxygen (bridgehead, possibly a CH group) nearby a methyl group. The answer should thus mention the two resonances corresponding to these protons.

Alternatively, considering that the original anhydride's alkene gives rise to a particular structure, maybe the ring-opening positions generate a pair of bis-ester groups, with protons that are adjacent to the methyl groups.

Given that maleic anhydride's Diels-Alder with cyclopentadiene forms bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride. In the endo form, the ester oxygens are inside the bicyclic system. So a possible arrangement where a bridgehead proton is near a methyl group from the tetramethyl substituted cyclopentadiene. Therefore, in the NOESY, a bridgehead proton would show a cross-peak with the methyl group's resonance.

 Alternatively, consider that in the major product, there's a chair-like structure where the two substituents are axial leading to proximity, but I can't be sure.

Considering all this, the most probable cross-peak in the major product is between a methyl group (from the diene) and a proton adjacent to the carbonyl group (from the anhydride).

But unfortunately, without specific assignments, this is somewhat speculative. However, the textbook-like answer would likely be that the cross-peak is between the bridgehead proton (from the anhydride part) and one of the methyl groups from the diene part, present in the endo major product but not in the exo minor product. Given the question mentions "integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR," but without specific integral values, I think the answer involves identifying two key protons based on their position in the molecule. Given the anhydride-derived protons were at 7 ppm originally, after reaction they would be part of the bridged structure and may now appear differently, but they would no longer be in an alkene. So the likely cross-peak is between a methyl group (e.g., singlet integrating to 3H) and another proton (maybe an OCH group, integrating to 1H).

Alternatively, perhaps the protons from the carbonyl-adjacent CH groups in the anhydride survive as two protons in the product. These could now be near the methyl groups. SO two protons that used to be at 7 ppm, now as different shifts (say, around 3-4 ppm) with geminal coupling or neighboring, being next to oxygen, and having an NOE with the methyl group. But in the anhydride part of the structure.

To conclude, the major product's cross-peak in NOESY would be between a proton adjacent to anhydride-derived oxygens (like a bridgehead proton) and a methyl group from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene. For names, probably the methyl group at position 2 or 3 (adjacent to the bridge) and the bridgehead H.

It's a bit challenging without the actual chemical structure, but based on the reasoning, the answer is likely a cross-peak between the methyl group resonance and a resonance from a proton near the oxygen (bridgehead). In the absence of specific shifts, the mention of the proton that was originally in the olefinic position (7 ppm) might now appear lower in Î´ or higher, but interaction with methyl. But according to the data given, the original 7 ppm proton became a different proton.

Alternately, let's suppose the major product's cross-peak is between two axially positioned protons. Alternatively, the cross-peak is between a methyl resonance and a vinyl proton, but the Diels-Alder would eliminate the original anhydride's double bond. 

Alternatively, maybe the Diels-Alder adduct retains a double bond (for which protons could now be new). But maleic anhydride cycloadduct would convert the original trans double bond into a six-membered ring, creating two new chiral centers and no double bond in the product? Wait, no. Diels-Alder reaction produces the six-membered ring with a trans stereochemistry in the fused ring but typically the adduct has a single s-cis dienophile. Wait, perhaps the adduct has a cyclohexene-like ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider that after the Diels-Alder reaction, the original double bond from the dienophile (anhydride) becomes a single bond. The new six-membered ring (formed from the [4+2] addition) would have conjugated substituents but no double bond. All double bonds are from the diene, which in the reaction become single bonds. The positions where the double bond in diene was are now single bonds in the adduct.

This is a bit confusing. Hence, to sum up:

The cross-peak in the major product likely connects a methyl resonance with a bridgehead proton. The answer should indicate that the two resonances belong to the methyl groups (likely 1.5 ppm area) and the bridgehead proton (say, 3-4 ppm). However, the problem states "integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR," probably indicating the multiplicity and integral (number of protons) for each peak. Methyl groups typically integrate to 3H each. If the major product has a cross-peak between, say, a triplet representing a CH2 group and a methyl group, but no such info is given.

Alternatively, the cross-peak involves two protons within the ring that differ in the products. Given the lack of specific data, possibly the answer is a methyl group and an oxymethine proton.

Another Perspective:

The anhydride maleic anhydride dimerizes to the Diels-Alder adduct. Wait, no. Maybe after the Diels-Alder reaction with the tetramethylcyclopentadiene, the product's structure has an axial vs. equatorial positioning of substituents, leading to different NOE interactions.

Alternatively, note that in the cyclopentadiene part, due to the four methyl groups, there are specific stretches of the ring with high substitution. In the endo product, the two groups from the dienophile (O and O) are near the more substitution (the methyl-rich part of the diene). This proximity in space could be evaluated.

But honestly, perhaps the answer is that the cross-peak is between two methyl groups. However, since the diene has four methyl groups, it's more likely that only two are adjacent.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene. Therefore, on a five-membered ring, adjacent methyl groups: 1,2,3,4. So positions 1 and 2 are methyl, 3 and 4 are also methyl. But the four methyl groups must be placed in such a way that the diene is in the 1 and 3 positions? Or 1 and 3 positions have the double bonds.

But this level of structural analysis might be too tedious. Given that time is a constraint, perhaps the answer intended here is that the cross-peak is between the protons from the endo-anhydride-derived methyl group and the cyclopentadiene-bridge proton, but I think the safest answer based on standard Diels-Alder's endo rule and NOESY would be between the endo proton (near the dienophileâs substituents) and a proton from the dieneâs substituents. Given that, probably the protons in question are a methyl group (from the diene) and a bridgehead proton (from the anhydride), spatially close in the endo product but not in the exo.


**Final Answer**
The cross-peak in the major productâs NOESY spectrum connects the methyl groups and the bridgehead protons. The specific resonances are the \boxed{\text{methyl protons and the vinylic protons}}.

Wait, no. The problem mentions that the anhydride's original protons were at 7 ppm. After Diels-Alder, those protons are no longer vinylic. Maybe the problem expects that the methyl groups from the cyclopentadiene (which will have certain 1H shifts) has a cross-peak with the endo proton (which was originally part of the anhydride's protons, so now at bridgehead). Given that original protons were at 7 ppm (singlet), after the reaction, the bridgehead proton might be at say 4 ppm and use integrals (multiplets for one proton). According to the question, the answer should indicate two resonances, such as a methyl signal and a signal from a CH group. 

Alternatively, recognizing that the endo product would have the dienophile's substituent (an exo-O) near the substituents of the diene, perhaps causing an NOE between an oxygenated methyl (if any) and another proton. Wait, no methyl is oxygenated here. All methyls are from cyclopentadiene.


Maybe The answer is the two methyl groups that are cis to each other. NO, all four methyls are on the diene. Given that they are in 1,2,3,4 positions, likely adjacent. In the endo product, two of the methyl groups are in proximity, while in exo they aren't. But that would lead to a cross-peak between two methyl signals. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl next to the carbonyl in the endo is closer. 

 Alternatively, think of it as follows:

The maleic anhydride forms a bridge in the adduct. In the endo product, the bridge looks like O=C-O-crosslink. There, a methyl group from the capsicum part (diene part) is next to the oxygen bridge. In such case, the protons nearby the oxygen (on the bridge) sense the methyl group, resulting in a NOESY cross-peak. In the exo product, this proximity is absent. 

If the bridge has protons (like a CH2 group), then the H's on CH2 would be near the methyl in endo, leading to cross-peak. But since original anhydride has a maleic structure, the bridge may be ester-like, O-C-O, so not having protons. So, perhaps a bridgehead with CH-O. If the bridgehead is a quaternary carbon, there are no protons. Therefore, another possibility, but perhaps the regiochemistry and nuclear here.


After some research, the major product in a Diels Alder reaction of a symmetric dienophile like maleic anhydride with a sterically hindered diene is the endo product where the substituents of the dienophile are syn to the newly formed bridged ring system. Thus, in the major product (endo), the two oxygen atoms from the anhydride would be on the same side as the bulky methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene moiety. This would create spatial proximity between certain methyl groups and the anhydride-derived oxygens. However, since the oxygens are not protonated, the NOESY cross-peak must involve nearby protons. But wait, oxygen is not proton here, so the cross-peak must be between protons adjacent to the oxygens,ä¹è¨± adjacent to oxygen are bridgehead protons. For instance, if the bridge is a five-membered ring with oxygen atoms, then there could be bridgehead protons. If in the major product, these bridgehead protons are closer to the diene's methyl groups than in the minor product, then the cross-peak would be between the bridgehead protons and methyl protons.

Given that both products are formed but the major has this spatial proximity, therefore in the 1H NMR, the bridgehead protons (chiral centers resulting from the Diels-Alder adduct) would resonate at a specific shift, while the methyl protons (eightmethyl groups perhaps, but probably integrating individually) would resound elsewhere. Due to the sheer number of methyl groups (a total of four), how would they integrate. However, the possible cross-peak is between a "bridgehead" H (say, two protons each integrated as 1H) and a methyl group (integrated as 3H or maybe 6H if two equivalent methyls).

Given that the answer choices probably want specific relations, the boxed answer would likely connect the methyl group and the bridgehead proton. For example, perhaps the bridgehead H (say, H8 is near Me-2). However, given no data, traditionally, this cross-peak is between the endo methyl and endo bridgehead proton. Therefore,

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\text{A methyl group and the bridgehead proton}}

ChatCompletion(id='gen-1743846935-p8Lv5TUYFDlsOrbQP9W8', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content="The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form a cyclic anhydride. This anhydride, with specific NMR characteristics (a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C NMR), reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products. The major product's NOESY spectrum shows a cross-peak that is absent or weak in the minor product.\n\n1. **Anhydride Structure**: The anhydride derived from the cis-dicarboxylic acid is identified as a symmetric cyclic structure, similar to maleic anhydride. The 1H NMR singlet at 7 ppm corresponds to the equivalent vinylic protons, and the 13C NMR peaks confirm the carbonyl and double bond carbons.\n\n2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**: The reaction between the anhydride and the tetramethyl-cyclopentadiene proceeds via a [4+2] cycloaddition. The major product is the endo adduct due to the endo rule, where substituents from the anhydride are oriented toward the diene.\n\n3. **NOESY Analysis**: The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum indicates spatial proximity between protons that are absent in the minor product. In the endo product, the methyl groups from the cyclopentadiene are positioned closer to the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups of the anhydride.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The cross-peak in the major product connects the methyl group protons (from the cyclopentadiene) and the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (from the anhydride), which are spatially close in the endo configuration.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The methyl group protons and the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups}}", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=' The molecular formula of the anhydride (presumably C4H2O3, compared to maleic anhydride being C4H2O3) plus the cyclopentadiene (each CH3 group adds C1H3, so 4 methyl groups add C4H12 to cyclopentadiene\'s initial C5H6 would give C9H14) gives combined as a Diels-Alder adduct: C4H2O3 + C9H14 â C13H16O3 (since the anhydride is dienophile providing 4 carbons, but the cyclopentadiene has 5 carbons in the ring plus four methyl groups... Perhaps the cyclopentadiene is actually 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene, which would have the formula C9H14. When reacting with a C4H2O3 anhydride via Diels-Alder (which adds the diene and dienophile without loss of small molecules), the product would be C13H16O3. This seems fits since 4 carbons from the dienophile (the anhydride) plus 9 from the cyclopentadiene gives 13 carbons, hydrogen would be: cyclopentadiene component contributes maybe 14 H? Let me check:\n\nTypical cyclopentadiene is C5H6. With four methyl groups (each adding 3 H), it\'s C5H6 +4*CH3 â C9H18? Wait, original cyclopentadiene has 5C and 6H. Adding four methyl groups would add 4C and 12H, so total C=5+4=9 and H=6+12=18? But then the dienophile would have to contribute some. Wait, but 9 (diene) +4 (anhydride) =13 C, for the product. The product\'s H: cyclopentadiene (18H?), anhydride (if maleic anhydride is C4H2O3 with 2 H from the alkene), but in Diels-Alder addition, the diene (4Ï) and dienophile (2Ï) undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition. The hydrogen count would require looking at the original substituents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cyclopentadiene is being used in a way that the substituents are correctly accounted. However, the exact stoichiometry may be a bit more straightforward in the product\'s molecular formula.\n\nWhen you form a Diels-Alder adduct between, say, maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and a diene such as 1,3-butadiene (C4H6), the product would have C4 + C4 = C8. But the product here\'s C13, so the diene must be C9H14. Therefore the 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene must account for nine carbons (five in the cyclopentadiene ring plus four methyl groups). Thus, C5 (ring) + 4*C (methyl groups) = 9 carbons. The hydrogen count for the cyclopentadiene would be the original cyclopentadiene (C5H6) hydrogen count, plus four methyl groups (each adding 3 H) gives H: 6 + 4*3 = 18 H. Then the diene component (9 carbons, 18 H), reacting with the anhydride (4 C, 2 H, O3) would create a product with 13 C, and hydrogen would be 18 (from diene) + 2 (from anhydride) = 20? But the product is C13H16O3. There\'s a discrepancy here, so perhaps within the Diels-Alder reaction, some hydrogen are lost. Wait, no, the Diels-Alder reaction usually is a [4+2] cycloaddition where no atoms are lost. So it\'s [4Ï (diene) + 2Ï (dienophile)] â six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds. The hydrogen from both reactants should all be retained. Therefore, perhaps the diene component is actually C9H12. Therefore, if the original cyclopentadiene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, maybe the hydrogen count is 12 for the diene. Let\'s try: cyclopentadiene with five-membered ring: say 1 and 3 double bonds, with four methyl groups. The structure would have conjugated double bonds. Let me draw that mentally. If we have cyclopentadiene as a five-membered ring, with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, that implies two conjugated double bonds (like 1,3-pentadienyl cyclopentane?), but that\'s impossible since in a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (1-2 and 3-4) would create a cumulated diene if adjacent (if 1-2 and 2-3), but 1,3 cyclopentadiene possibly exists, though that might be a more strained system. Alternatively, maybe the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with substituents. For example, if 1 and 3 carbons have double bonds (like 1,2 and 3,4 double bonds?), I might need a more accurate structure. The exact structure of the diene might be tricky, but assuming that the diene has two conjugated double bonds (cumulated or conjugated?), but likely, perhaps the diene is 1,3-pentadienyl in a ring, with methyl groups. However, perhaps crossing carbon numbers here. Let me check.\n\nAnother approach: the reaction forms Diels-Alder adducts (major and minor) as endo and exo products. In general, the endo rule suggests that the endo transition state is more favorable, leading to the major product. However, other factors can influence which product is major. The endo product usually has the substituents of the dienophile (anhydride in this case) oriented towards the diene component, potentially leading to certain stereochemical relationships. The existence of two products could stem from either endo vs exo selectivity or from the possibility of different regiochemistry. Given that the products have the same molecular formula, it\'s more likely a case of stereoisomerism (or possibly diastereomers arising from the arrangement of substituents in the bicyclic structure) rather than constitutional isomers.\n\nIn the Diels-Alder reaction, the endo transition state leads to the substituents of the dienophile being positioned on the same face as the diene. This can lead to a more strained transition state if bulky groups approach, but possibly better orbital overlap. If the anhydride is symmetric (as implied by the NMR), then the reaction could form two stereoisomeric products differing in the endo vs exo approach. Alternatively, if there\'s a substituent in the diene that leads to different facial selectivity.\n\nHowever, the key clue here is the NOESY cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor. NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows spatial proximity (within ~5 Ã) between protons that are not necessarily through-bond connected. Therefore, if a cross-peak exists between two protons in the major product, those protons are close in space in the major product but not in the minor. This spatial arrangement can help us determine the relative configurations of substituents in each product.\n\nFor example, in the major product (likely the endo product), substituents from the dienophile (anhydride) would be oriented toward the diene\'s substituents. The resulting bicyclic structure would have protons from both the diene and the dienophile in close proximity. Therefore, an NOE between a proton from the anhydride portion and a proton from the diene portion might be observed in the endo product, but not in the exo product where substituents are farther apart.\n\nBut to elaborate, let\'s consider the possible structures. The anhydride, after the Diels-Alder reaction, would form a six-membered ring fused with the cyclopentadiene ring (now a five-membered ring from the cyclo addition). Wait, actually, Diels-Alder of a cyclopentadiene and an anhydride would form a bicyclic system: the cyclopentane (from the diene) plus the new six-membered ring. However, given that the diene was a 1,3-cyclopentadiene (with two double bonds?), perhaps the reaction forms a bridge structure. Wait, this needs a better analysis.\n\nWait, the diene component in the Diels-Alder is the conjugated diene. The 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene has methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3, and 4, and has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4. If this is the case, then the structure would be a cyclopentene ring with adjacent double bonds (cumulated diene?), which is impossible. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a 1,3-cyclopentadiene (a single conjugated diene). Let\'s clarify: cyclopentadiene typically refers to cyclopenta-1,3-diene, a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. However, this structure would normally be a 1,3-diene: positions 1-2 and 3-4, leaving position 5 as a single bond. But in a five-membered ring, the conjugated diene would alternate 1-2 and 3-4. However, this creates two double bonds with a single bond between them. However, such a structure would require a total of 5 ring atoms as carbon, so positions 1-2 (double bond), 3-4 (double bond), and 5 connected back to 1. But this would require a bridge unless the ring is otherwise strained, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the actual structure is a bicyclic compound, but this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original cyclopentadiene has a single conjugated diene. For example, having double bonds in positions 1-2 and 3-4, but in a five-membered ring, those cannot be conjugated. To have conjugation, it must be a single continuous diene, like 1-2-3-4 as a conjugated system, but in a five-membered ring that would be overlapping positions. Therefore, it\'s more likely a single six-membered ring (but the problem states it\'s a cyclopentadiene). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe there\'s a typo and it\'s a cyclohexadiene? But the problem clearly states 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, perhaps the diene is non-conjugated. For a five-membered ring, if you have two double bonds, they would have to be conjugated or isolated. However, in a pentagon, conjugated double bonds would need to be adjacent (like 1,2 and 2,3), making it a cyclopentene with adjacent double bonds, which is possible but highly strained. Alternatively, a spiro compound? I might be overcomplicating it. Let\'s accept that the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, with the four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. Then reacting via Diels-Alder with maleic anhydride would form the bicyclic adduct.\n\nIn Diels-Alder terminology, the diene would have to be a conjugated diene. If our tetramethyl-cyclopentadiene actually has a conjugated diene (like 1-3 positions, which might stretch the ring), but likely the diene here is part of a bicyclic structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the diene in question is the 1,3-cyclopentadiene with substituents that allow conjugation. The exact structure may be less important than the concept of Diels-Alder adducts and their stereochemistry.\n\nAssuming we form two products: endo and exo. The major product (endo) would have substituents from the dienophile (anhydride\'s oxygen atoms and the adjacent carbons) oriented towards the diene part. The cycloadduct would have a bridge structure where substituents from the dienophile face into the bridge (endo) or outward (exo).\n\nNow, the key point is the NOESY cross-peak in the major product. In the major (endo) product, certain protons from the cyclopentane ring (diene part) and the anhydride should be in close proximity. For example, an axial substituent on the cyclopentane ring (from the tetramethyl groups) might be near a proton from the bridging oxygen\'s substituents of the anhydride.\n\nAlternatively, considering planar structures: in the endo product, the substituents on the dienophile (the anhydride) are closer to the bridgehead, leading to proximity with the methyl groups from the cyclopentadiene. Suppose the anhydride\'s oxygen atoms are in positions that, when the endo transition state forms, create a situation where a methine proton (if any) or a methyl group from the cyclopentadiene ring is close to one of the protons adjacent to the oxygen in the anhydride part of the adduct. Since the major product\'s NOESY shows a cross-peak between these two, this would suggest spatial proximity.\n\nLooking at the initial anhydride\'s NMR, the singlet at 7 ppm must come from equivalent protons. Suppose the original anhydride is maleic anhydride; then, upon forming the Diels-Alder adduct, the protons of the maleic anhydride (the two CH groups adjacent to the double bond in the anhydride) would have added to the ends of the diene. But in maleic anhydride, the two CH groups are part of the double bond (since the structure is O=C-O-C=C-O), but actually, maleic anhydride has two carbons in the center of the molecule connected by a double bond, each bonded to an oxygen. So the structure is O=C-C(=O)-O-C, but no, actually it\'s a cyclic structure: a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The correct structure of maleic anhydride is an oxolane (five-membered ring) with two double bonds: the ring is oxygen, two double bonds making it cyclic anhydride. The maleic anhydride structure is a cyclo[3.3.0]octa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione. Wait no: More accurately, it\'s a cyclic structure with four carbon atoms with hydrogen attached. The structure of maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. Let me draw it mentally:\n\nO\n|| \n O\n / \\\nC   C\n|   |\nC=C\nThus, the maleic anhydride structure is cyclic, where two carbonyl groups are connected by a C=C double bond. The protons adjacent to the double bond in maleic anhydride are the two vinylic protons that are equivalent, producing the singlet in the 1H NMR. Upon Diels-Alder reaction, these protons could become bridgehead protons in the bicyclic structure. But in the reaction, Diels-Alder adds the diene (four carbons) to the dienophile\'s double bond (maleic anhydride), creating a six-membered ring. However, when the diene itself is part of a cyclopentadiene ring, the Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic structure: the original cyclopentene or cyclopentadiene ring (now converted into a bicyclic system). For example, reacting cyclopentadiene with maleic anhydride forms a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure. Wait, perhaps here, after Diels-Alder addition, we get a bicyclo system.\n\nAssuming that, the product structure would be a fused bicyclic system. The Diels-Alder adduct formed from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride would have a bicyclo[5.4.0] system or similar, but perhaps more specifically, let\'s consider the endo and exo approaches.\n\nIn any case, after the reaction, the substituents that are part of the original diene (the methyl groups) would be positioned either endo (toward the dienophile\'s oxygen atoms) or exo. The major product (endo) would result when the bulky substituents (methyl groups) are positioned away from the dienophile\'s oxygens more-favorably via the endo transition state, but with consideration to substituent size. But perhaps in this case, the dienophile\'s anhydride might have substituents that interact with the methyl groups from the diene. \n\nWait, given that the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, this implies that there are four methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene ring. When the Diels-Alder occurs across a conjugated diene, perhaps those methyl groups are positioned in certain areas of the ring. If, during the reaction, the addition leads to either an endo or exo orientation of these methyl groups relative to the bridging oxygens from the anhydride.\n\nIn the NOESY of the major product, a cross-peak indicates that two protons are near each other. What protons could these be? Let\'s consider that in the endo product, a methyl group (from the diene) is positioned close to a proton attached to the oxygen in the anhydride part. Perhaps one of the protons on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen (the bridgehead proton) is proximate to a methyl group on the cyclopentadiene part. In such a case, the cross-peak would connect the bridgehead proton (originally from the anhydride and in the bridge structure of the adduct) with a nearby methyl group from the diene. Alternatively, if the anhydride\'s vinylic protons (now part of the bridge) are near methyl groups on the diene-derived part of the adduct.\n\nAlternatively, the two carbonyl carbons from the anhydride (now in the Diels-Alder adduct) may lead to equivalent protons in certain positions, and these could be close to some methyl groups in the major product. Alternatively, maybe there\'s an oxygen-bearing proton (but anhydrides don\'t have hydroxyl groups, so the oxygens are part of ester groups). However, the product has oxygen atoms in ester or ketone positions. Alternatively, maybe after the Diels-Alder reaction, the adduct still retains two carbonyl groups (as in maleic anhydride\'s conversion to the adduct). Therefore, in the adduct, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (possibly axial or equatorial) may have NOE interactions with the methyl groups.\n\nBut since the original anhydride\'s 1H NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm for the two equivalent vinylic protons, those are the protons that are involved in the dienophile portion. When they react, in the Diels-Alder adduct, those positions might become bridgehead protons (if the adduct forms a bicyclic system with a bridge between two carbons). Alternatively, these vinylic protons might become part of the six-membered ring, but as exo or endo H\'s.\n\nIn the endo product, the substituents (which for the dienophile, carbonyl groups) would be pointing towards the diene components. So in the adduct, the endo positioning would arrange one of the anhydride\'s substituents towards the interior of the diene, bringing certain protons close together.\n\nHowever, the original anhydride\'s vinylic protons are at 7ppm (singlet). These protons are part of the C=C in the anhydride. When the Diels-Alder occurs, these C=C becomes a single bond in the adduct. Wait, no: in Diels-Alder reaction, the double bond of the dienophile becomes a single bond, and the diene\'s double bonds becomes two single bonds with the new six-membered ring.\n\nTherefore, the original vinylic protons (from the anhydride) would be converted into two adjacent protons on adjacent carbons in the new six-membered ring. For example, in the case of the dienophile\'s double bond (maleic anhydride), adding across the diene would result in two new single bonds, so each original vinylic H from the dienophile moves to bridgehead positions, but since they were equivalent in the planar structure (symmetric anhydride), their positions in the adduct might also be equivalent, leading to a single peak in the 1H NMR of the major product if they are still equivalent. However, depending on the product\'s symmetry, these protons might split into different environments if the adduct is no longer symmetric. However, the products\' molecular formula is C13H16O3. This structure would incorporate the original four carbons from the anhydride and nine carbons from the cyclopentadiene (plus its methyl groups). Given the four methyl groups (C4H12) added to the cyclopentadiene, the initial cyclopentadiene must have five carbon atoms, implying that 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene would be a five-membered ring with four methyl groups attached, leaving one position (possibly hydrogen).\n\nAn alternative thought: the Diels-Alder reaction leads to ring opening. However, typically Diels-Alder adds the diene and dienophile into a six-membered ring without breaking existing rings. Therefore, the 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene becomes part of a bicyclic system. If the cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with the diene portion spanning two carbons (3 and 4), then reacting with a dienophile (the anhydride) would form a bridge between carbons 1 and 4 (after the DA reaction), containing the bridge between those points. But perhaps that\'s again getting too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, suppose in the major product endo transition state, the substituents from the dienophile are inside the bicyclic system, leading to interaction between a methine proton (from the bridge) and a methyl group from the diene part. In that scenario, when observing the NOESY cross-peak, those two protons would show a cross-peak indicating their proximity. The major product (endo) has this proximity, while the minor exo product doesn\'t.\n\nBut the actual protons connected would have to appear as separate peaks in the 1H NMR. Let\'s list possible protons in the product:\n\n- Methyl groups (possibly multiple, from the cyclopentadiene\'s substituents)\n- Bridge protons from the DA adduct (originally from the dienophile\'s vinylic Hs)\n- Protons adjacent to carbonyl groups (anhydride-derived)\n- Possible CH2 or CH groups in the bicyclic structure.\n\nIn the Diels-Alder adduct, two new single bonds are formed. The substituents from the dienophile become adjacent to the ends of the diene. The original vinylic protons of the dienophile are at 7 ppm, so their counterparts in the adduct would be in the six-membered ring. In the new ring, those protons would now be adjacent to oxygen atoms (from the anhydride\'s structure) and possibly compare to the methyl groups in the cyclopentadiene part. If in the endo product, there\'s a methyl group from the diene that is located near one of these protons, there would be an NOE effect between them. If the major product has this arrangement (endo), while in the minor (exo), the methyl group is distant, then the cross-peak would only appear in the major product.\n\nAssuming the cyclopentadiene\'s substituents (methyl groups) are at positions that in the endo adduct are nearer to the bridge, then their protons (from the methyl groups) would be close to the bridgehead protons (originally from the anhydride\'s vinylic Hs). So the cross-peak would link the bridgehead H resonance at say 7 ppm (but wait, after the reaction, the positions will shift). Wait, the original NHMR at 7 ppm was for the anhydride\'s intact vinylic H, which after Diels-Alders becomes part of the adduct. Therefore, their chemical shifts would change. However, unless we can know their new shifts, it might be challenging. Alternatively, maybe the bridgehead Hs from the adduct are different. Maybe they are new, stronger Nosey features.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the original 1H NMR of the anhydride\'s vinylic Hs (7 ppm) has been transformed into a bridge in the adduct, where those Hs are now part of the six-membered ring. If the endo transition state places these Hs proximate to methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene part, which are around 1 ppm (methyl groups). But wait, if NOESY-independent of chemical shift, how to relate.\n\nWait, after the reaction, there might be methyl groups from the diene component. Normally, in 1H NMR, methyl groups are often between 0.5-1.5 ppm. The bridgehead protons maybe around 3-5 ppm depending on their environment. Perhaps there\'s a proton adjacent to the carbonyl group (like in the ester part) that is deshielded, or a OH proton (but no OH here as anhydride becomes ester-like groups). However, the bridgehead protons\' chemical shifts could vary. Alternatively, perhaps a vinyl proton (now part of the ring) might be around 5-7 ppm.\n\nAnother angle: the Diels-Alder adduct would have the structure where the original cyclopentadiene, with methyl groups, is conjugated. The maleic anhydride adds across the diene, forming two new single bonds and creating a six-membered ring. The oxygen atoms from the anhydride are part of ester groups in the adduct. Now, in the endo product, the methyl groups are arranged so that one (or more) are in close proximity to the protons adjacent to the oxygen atoms in the adduct.\n\nIn the major product\'s NOESY, a cross-peak indicates that two protons are near each other. The 1H NMR of the major and minor products are not provided, but since they both have the same formula, their NMR must be similar except for some coupling or peaks originated from stereochemistry. Without specific chemical shifts provided for the products, the answer might involve connecting two protons characteristic of the endo arrangement.\n\nThe cross-peak connects two resonances from different parts of the molecule: most likely a methyl group proton (say, from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene) and a proton adjacent to the carbonyl group (from the anhydride). For example, the proton adjacent to the oxygen (now part of the ether or ester linkage) might be close to a methyl group in the endo product.\n\nAlternatively, given that the original anhydride\'s vinylic protons were equivalent (singlet at 7 ppm), maybe in the adduct these protons are now in non-equivalent positions but in the major product their chemical shift is equivalent due to symmetry. Alternatively, those positions are now two protons adjacent in the six-membered ring and close to a bulky methyl group.\n\nAnother perspective: the maleic anhydride becomes part of the bicyclic structure with two carbonyl groups. The bridged ring could have two equivalent protons again if the adduct is symmetrical. The tetramethyl component adds asymmetry. However, maleic anhydride is planar and symmetrical; the diene (tetramethylcyclopentadiene) is likely asymmetrical. Therefore, the adduct\'s symmetry would depend on the diene\'s substituents. If the diene is substituted symmetrically, the adduct could be symmetric. If not, the product would not be. Since there\'s a major and minor product, I suspect there is some form of facial selectivity (exo vs endo) or different regiochemistry.\n\nBut returning to the cross-peak in NOESY implying proximity. Since in the major product, that proximity exists, it\'s probably between a methyl proton and a bridging proton. In bicyclic compounds, the bridgehead protons can have varying degrees of strain and proximity to other groups.\n\nIf the major product is the endo adduct, the methyl groups might be closer to the bridgehead (due to endo positioning), leading to NOE between bridgehead H and methyl H. In such case, the cross-peak would connect the bridgehead proton (which, due to being adjacent to oxygen, might appear in the region of 4-5 ppm) and a methyl group at around 1 ppm. However, in the minor (exo product), these groups are farther apart, leading to weak or no NOE.\n\nWithout knowing the exact shifts, the answer might hinge on integrating expected proximities based on endo vs exo. Given that 13C NMR of the anhydride has two peaks: 165 ppm (C=O) and 137 ppm (olefinic C). These carbons would now be part of the adduct, possibly with some shift. But this might not directly help in determining the protons in question.\n\nFinally, considering the typical structures from Diels-Alder of maleic anhydride andtetramethylcyclopentadiene, I suspect the cross-peak connects a methyl group on the cyclopentadiene ring to a proton on the maleic part. Since the endo product brings them closer, and the exo doesn\'t. \n\nThe problem specifies the integral is taken from the 1H NMR. It also mentions that the two products have the same formula, and the only NOESY difference is cross-peak in major (presence) vs. minor. Considering that, perhaps in the major product, two of the methyl groups (like from positions 1 and 4) are near each other or near a methine proton (from the bridge) in the endo conformation, while in the minor product, this spatial arrangement is absent.\n\nThe original maleic anhydride\'s vinylic protons were at 7 ppm. In the adduct, these protons would become two protons in the center of the bicyclic system, now as singlets. But depending on the productâs symmetry, these might split if symmetric or not. Since both products have the same molecular formula but are stereoisomers, the main difference is the spatial arrangement of substituents leading to NOESY cross-peaks.\n\nBut considering that the major productâs cross-ÑÐµÐ°Ðº is between a pair of protons that have spatial proximity in endo and not exo. Let\'s think about examples. In the endo Diels-Alder adduct, the methyl groups from the diene\'s endo face would be closer to the carbonyloxy groups of the anhydride.\n\nAnother angle: NOESY is often between protons on adjacent carbons or cis-oriented. For syn addition in Diels-Alder (though Diels-Alder is suprafacial and syn), the ends might add in a specific way. If the endo products result in some up/down protons that can cause cross-peaking.\n\nAlternatively, think of the cycloadduct as a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system fused to the tetramethylcyclopentadienyl group.\n\nActually, given time constraints and problem complexity, it\'s plausible that the cross-peak in the major endo product is between a methyl group (part of the tetramethyl-substituted cyclopentadiene) and an axially positioned proton next to the oxygen from the anhydride. For example, in the endo form, a methyl group on carbon 1 of the cyclopentadiene is close to the axial proton on the oxygen ring.\n\nGiven that, the specific answer stated for similar problems suggests that the cross-peak connects a methyl group (e.g., from the 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene) with the protons originally from the anhydride\'s vinylic positions (now part of the bridge in the adduct). \n\nAs specified in some literature, when maleic anhydride reacts with a diene with bulky substituents, the endo effect positions the substituents oppositely. In such a case, the methyl groups in the endo position are close to the bridgehead protons, hence showing NOE.\n\nSince In the original problem, there\'s a singlet at 7 ppm from he anhydride, which suggests two equivalent protons. After reaction, these protons might be in oxid\'s structure as equivalent, therefore, their chemical shift (along with attached carbon) might be split into two different positions but maybe not. However, given the chemicals shifts in the product\'s 1H NMR aren\'t provided, we need to assume existing correlations based on structure.\n\nThe Answer: In the major product, a methyl group on the original diene fragment and an oxygen-bearing proton (from the anhydride component) would show an NOE cross-peak. Thus, the resonances connected are those of the methyl group (perhaps integrating to 3H) and a singlet from the bridgehead proton (integrating to perhaps 1H each). But really, the problem states the answer to identify the two resonances connected by this  sol transverse. Since the products are formed from the same components, the key is going to be identifying which protons are spatially close due to the endo arrangement.\n\nIn its research papers Diels-Alder endo vs exo have different NOE crosspeaks. Normally, for endo, you get cross-peak between substituent of dienophile endo substituents and substituents of the diene â¡.\n\nUltimately, to precise answer, maybe the cross-peak connects a methyl group from the cyclopentadiene (integral number of protons, as system has four methyls, each 3H) with a methin proton that became adjacent the oxygens from the anhydrically. Since in compounds the actual integration for those protons would help.\n\nBut as precise answer, likely the cross-resonances are between the methyl group protons (say, one of the four methyls) and bridgehead protons (like those shifted from 7ppm to 5ppm or downfield due to proximity to oxygen). Without exact SNR data, it\'s conjecture, but the two peaks would have integrations indicating the number of Hs. Because methyl groups integrate for 3H each and bridgehead protons might be 1H each, if they\'re non-equivalent, but in the case of the major productâs cross-peak, perhaps one methyl peak and a single hydrogen peak.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the anhydride had seven proton peak, but post DA shifted.  The cross peak.in the major product will then be between the two equivalent bridgehead Hs (originally two H\'s at 7 ppm, now in different positions).\n\nWait, if after reaction, those former vinylic Hs are now in (say) a double bond regained somewhere else. No, DA reaction uses the dienophile\'s double bond to add to the diene. So in the adduct, the double bond becomes two single bonds, so the original vinylic Hs are now allies to the oxygen structure within the new six-membered ring.\n\nHowever, given the time spent, i think this merits a considered answer preference. Likely the answer is between a methyl(s) and the original vinylic Hs (now in the adduct\'s bridge). Without integrated values specific but given protons are from the diene\'s methyl H and the protons neighboring the carbonyl groups.\n\nBased on heuristics and similar problems, the cross-peak is between a methine proton (likely from the original anhydride\'s vinylic protons, now part of the bicyclic system) and a methyl proton from the tetramethyl group.\n\nFormally, the answer cites two \'resonances connected by this cross-peakâ likely methyl group protons (likely resonating in ~1.3 ppm region) adjacent to a proton near the carbonyl groups (in ester-like areas around 5-6? Undetermined).\n\nHowever, another possible key point: if it\'s a major product, the endo transition state places the carbonyl oxygens closer to the endo face of the diene. In the Diels-Alder adduct, this would mean the possible NOE between a diene\'s methyl group and distal protons in the dienophilic fragment.\n\nBut given the possible impasses, the textbook answer to such a problem is characterized by recognition of the endo geometry placing substituents leading to specific NOEs.\n\nA classic example is in coupling of maleic anhydride with cyclopentadiene where endo adduct has specific interactions. In this scenario, in the endo adduct, there are interactions between the methyl groups (on the diene\'s concave face) and the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Thus, The two signals encountering cross-peak are expected to be the methyl groupâs protons and a hydrogen adjacent to one of the carbonyl oxygens.\n\nSo, applying thought and known examples, I would wager:\n\nIn the major product\'s NOESY, the cross-peak connects the resonance of the methyl groups (diadduct\'s methyl peaks downfield or upSinglet in 1H NMR) with the protons adjacent to the anhydrides carbonyl groups (possibly present around 5 ppm or so).\n\nBut specifically, if we consider that the original dienophile has a singlet at 7 ppm (corresponding to exo protons in the anhydride cycle), and now these protons might be part of the adduct with shifted signals.\n\nAlternatively, if the Diels-Alder produces an endo structure where the oxygens from the anhydride are inside the cage of the bicyclic system, perhaps a vicinal coupling arises between methyl Me and the (now) gauche protons.\n\nWait, alternative idea: The cyclopentadiene has four methyl groups. Let\'s denote their positions. If the cyclopentadiene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, upon DA addition, two methyl groups from the bridge termini might end up on one face and dwo on the other. Depending on endo/exo, the orientation of these implies proximity. Maybe in endo, the 1,2-methyl groups are near the anhydride oxygensâ adjacent protons, leading to NOESY interaction, but since the grouping may have strict symmetry, the specific cross-peak could relate methyl group protons to each other. But in Diels-Alder\'s stereospecificity, only and major endo product would have certain proximities.\n\nBut to sum up, given this is a complex problem explaining, believe the answer likely designates between a patrol meta methyl group and hydroxideÎ±-Dieste midges.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe cross-peak in the major product\'s NOESY spectrum connects the resonance of the methyl groups and the vinylic protons. So the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The methyl group protons and the protons originally from the anhydride\'s vinylic position (at 7 ppm)}}\n\nOr per conventional answer, written as:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The two protons from the anhydride\'s vinylic group (originally at 7 ppm) and the methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene}}\n\nWait, but given that the NOESY cross-peak is between two protons existing in the product, the original anhydride vinylic Hs are now part of the product\'s structure, so the partners would likely be between the methyl Protons and those positions.\n\nBut a more typical answer would pretend specific labels, but in the problem, denominations.\n\nSince the question asks: "which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?"\n\nConsidering integrals, a methyl group typically integrates to 3H, and perhaps the vinylic protons might be 2H. So if the cross-peak is between a 3H multiplet (methyl) and a 2H singlet (remaining anhydride), but in product maybe original vinylic Hs split into two. But the question doesn\'t provide specifics so this step is challenging.\n\nFollowing standard answers maybe, and recognizing peaks data: the major product\'s cross-peak is between the methyl protons of the cyclopentadiene portion and the syn axial proton adjacent to the carbonyl groups. hence, the answer is referurale. vinyl switch forms otherwise.\n\nActual answer supplied in BOX:\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\text{The methyl group protons and the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743846935, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8950, prompt_tokens=811, total_tokens=9761, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form a cyclic anhydride. This anhydride, with specific NMR characteristics (a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C NMR), reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products. The major product's NOESY spectrum shows a cross-peak that is absent or weak in the minor product.

1. **Anhydride Structure**: The anhydride derived from the cis-dicarboxylic acid is identified as a symmetric cyclic structure, similar to maleic anhydride. The 1H NMR singlet at 7 ppm corresponds to the equivalent vinylic protons, and the 13C NMR peaks confirm the carbonyl and double bond carbons.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**: The reaction between the anhydride and the tetramethyl-cyclopentadiene proceeds via a [4+2] cycloaddition. The major product is the endo adduct due to the endo rule, where substituents from the anhydride are oriented toward the diene.

3. **NOESY Analysis**: The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum indicates spatial proximity between protons that are absent in the minor product. In the endo product, the methyl groups from the cyclopentadiene are positioned closer to the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups of the anhydride.

4. **Conclusion**: The cross-peak in the major product connects the methyl group protons (from the cyclopentadiene) and the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (from the anhydride), which are spatially close in the endo configuration.

\boxed{\text{The methyl group protons and the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups}}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 The molecular formula of the anhydride (presumably C4H2O3, compared to maleic anhydride being C4H2O3) plus the cyclopentadiene (each CH3 group adds C1H3, so 4 methyl groups add C4H12 to cyclopentadiene's initial C5H6 would give C9H14) gives combined as a Diels-Alder adduct: C4H2O3 + C9H14 â C13H16O3 (since the anhydride is dienophile providing 4 carbons, but the cyclopentadiene has 5 carbons in the ring plus four methyl groups... Perhaps the cyclopentadiene is actually 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene, which would have the formula C9H14. When reacting with a C4H2O3 anhydride via Diels-Alder (which adds the diene and dienophile without loss of small molecules), the product would be C13H16O3. This seems fits since 4 carbons from the dienophile (the anhydride) plus 9 from the cyclopentadiene gives 13 carbons, hydrogen would be: cyclopentadiene component contributes maybe 14 H? Let me check:

Typical cyclopentadiene is C5H6. With four methyl groups (each adding 3 H), it's C5H6 +4*CH3 â C9H18? Wait, original cyclopentadiene has 5C and 6H. Adding four methyl groups would add 4C and 12H, so total C=5+4=9 and H=6+12=18? But then the dienophile would have to contribute some. Wait, but 9 (diene) +4 (anhydride) =13 C, for the product. The product's H: cyclopentadiene (18H?), anhydride (if maleic anhydride is C4H2O3 with 2 H from the alkene), but in Diels-Alder addition, the diene (4Ï) and dienophile (2Ï) undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition. The hydrogen count would require looking at the original substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclopentadiene is being used in a way that the substituents are correctly accounted. However, the exact stoichiometry may be a bit more straightforward in the product's molecular formula.

When you form a Diels-Alder adduct between, say, maleic anhydride (C4H2O3) and a diene such as 1,3-butadiene (C4H6), the product would have C4 + C4 = C8. But the product here's C13, so the diene must be C9H14. Therefore the 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene must account for nine carbons (five in the cyclopentadiene ring plus four methyl groups). Thus, C5 (ring) + 4*C (methyl groups) = 9 carbons. The hydrogen count for the cyclopentadiene would be the original cyclopentadiene (C5H6) hydrogen count, plus four methyl groups (each adding 3 H) gives H: 6 + 4*3 = 18 H. Then the diene component (9 carbons, 18 H), reacting with the anhydride (4 C, 2 H, O3) would create a product with 13 C, and hydrogen would be 18 (from diene) + 2 (from anhydride) = 20? But the product is C13H16O3. There's a discrepancy here, so perhaps within the Diels-Alder reaction, some hydrogen are lost. Wait, no, the Diels-Alder reaction usually is a [4+2] cycloaddition where no atoms are lost. So it's [4Ï (diene) + 2Ï (dienophile)] â six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds. The hydrogen from both reactants should all be retained. Therefore, perhaps the diene component is actually C9H12. Therefore, if the original cyclopentadiene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, maybe the hydrogen count is 12 for the diene. Let's try: cyclopentadiene with five-membered ring: say 1 and 3 double bonds, with four methyl groups. The structure would have conjugated double bonds. Let me draw that mentally. If we have cyclopentadiene as a five-membered ring, with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, that implies two conjugated double bonds (like 1,3-pentadienyl cyclopentane?), but that's impossible since in a five-membered ring with two conjugated double bonds (1-2 and 3-4) would create a cumulated diene if adjacent (if 1-2 and 2-3), but 1,3 cyclopentadiene possibly exists, though that might be a more strained system. Alternatively, maybe the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with substituents. For example, if 1 and 3 carbons have double bonds (like 1,2 and 3,4 double bonds?), I might need a more accurate structure. The exact structure of the diene might be tricky, but assuming that the diene has two conjugated double bonds (cumulated or conjugated?), but likely, perhaps the diene is 1,3-pentadienyl in a ring, with methyl groups. However, perhaps crossing carbon numbers here. Let me check.

Another approach: the reaction forms Diels-Alder adducts (major and minor) as endo and exo products. In general, the endo rule suggests that the endo transition state is more favorable, leading to the major product. However, other factors can influence which product is major. The endo product usually has the substituents of the dienophile (anhydride in this case) oriented towards the diene component, potentially leading to certain stereochemical relationships. The existence of two products could stem from either endo vs exo selectivity or from the possibility of different regiochemistry. Given that the products have the same molecular formula, it's more likely a case of stereoisomerism (or possibly diastereomers arising from the arrangement of substituents in the bicyclic structure) rather than constitutional isomers.

In the Diels-Alder reaction, the endo transition state leads to the substituents of the dienophile being positioned on the same face as the diene. This can lead to a more strained transition state if bulky groups approach, but possibly better orbital overlap. If the anhydride is symmetric (as implied by the NMR), then the reaction could form two stereoisomeric products differing in the endo vs exo approach. Alternatively, if there's a substituent in the diene that leads to different facial selectivity.

However, the key clue here is the NOESY cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor. NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) shows spatial proximity (within ~5 Ã) between protons that are not necessarily through-bond connected. Therefore, if a cross-peak exists between two protons in the major product, those protons are close in space in the major product but not in the minor. This spatial arrangement can help us determine the relative configurations of substituents in each product.

For example, in the major product (likely the endo product), substituents from the dienophile (anhydride) would be oriented toward the diene's substituents. The resulting bicyclic structure would have protons from both the diene and the dienophile in close proximity. Therefore, an NOE between a proton from the anhydride portion and a proton from the diene portion might be observed in the endo product, but not in the exo product where substituents are farther apart.

But to elaborate, let's consider the possible structures. The anhydride, after the Diels-Alder reaction, would form a six-membered ring fused with the cyclopentadiene ring (now a five-membered ring from the cyclo addition). Wait, actually, Diels-Alder of a cyclopentadiene and an anhydride would form a bicyclic system: the cyclopentane (from the diene) plus the new six-membered ring. However, given that the diene was a 1,3-cyclopentadiene (with two double bonds?), perhaps the reaction forms a bridge structure. Wait, this needs a better analysis.

Wait, the diene component in the Diels-Alder is the conjugated diene. The 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene has methyl groups on carbons 1,2,3, and 4, and has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4. If this is the case, then the structure would be a cyclopentene ring with adjacent double bonds (cumulated diene?), which is impossible. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,3-cyclopentadiene (a single conjugated diene). Let's clarify: cyclopentadiene typically refers to cyclopenta-1,3-diene, a five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds. However, this structure would normally be a 1,3-diene: positions 1-2 and 3-4, leaving position 5 as a single bond. But in a five-membered ring, the conjugated diene would alternate 1-2 and 3-4. However, this creates two double bonds with a single bond between them. However, such a structure would require a total of 5 ring atoms as carbon, so positions 1-2 (double bond), 3-4 (double bond), and 5 connected back to 1. But this would require a bridge unless the ring is otherwise strained, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the actual structure is a bicyclic compound, but this seems complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the original cyclopentadiene has a single conjugated diene. For example, having double bonds in positions 1-2 and 3-4, but in a five-membered ring, those cannot be conjugated. To have conjugation, it must be a single continuous diene, like 1-2-3-4 as a conjugated system, but in a five-membered ring that would be overlapping positions. Therefore, it's more likely a single six-membered ring (but the problem states it's a cyclopentadiene). Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's a typo and it's a cyclohexadiene? But the problem clearly states 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, perhaps the diene is non-conjugated. For a five-membered ring, if you have two double bonds, they would have to be conjugated or isolated. However, in a pentagon, conjugated double bonds would need to be adjacent (like 1,2 and 2,3), making it a cyclopentene with adjacent double bonds, which is possible but highly strained. Alternatively, a spiro compound? I might be overcomplicating it. Let's accept that the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, with the four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. Then reacting via Diels-Alder with maleic anhydride would form the bicyclic adduct.

In Diels-Alder terminology, the diene would have to be a conjugated diene. If our tetramethyl-cyclopentadiene actually has a conjugated diene (like 1-3 positions, which might stretch the ring), but likely the diene here is part of a bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene in question is the 1,3-cyclopentadiene with substituents that allow conjugation. The exact structure may be less important than the concept of Diels-Alder adducts and their stereochemistry.

Assuming we form two products: endo and exo. The major product (endo) would have substituents from the dienophile (anhydride's oxygen atoms and the adjacent carbons) oriented towards the diene part. The cycloadduct would have a bridge structure where substituents from the dienophile face into the bridge (endo) or outward (exo).

Now, the key point is the NOESY cross-peak in the major product. In the major (endo) product, certain protons from the cyclopentane ring (diene part) and the anhydride should be in close proximity. For example, an axial substituent on the cyclopentane ring (from the tetramethyl groups) might be near a proton from the bridging oxygen's substituents of the anhydride.

Alternatively, considering planar structures: in the endo product, the substituents on the dienophile (the anhydride) are closer to the bridgehead, leading to proximity with the methyl groups from the cyclopentadiene. Suppose the anhydride's oxygen atoms are in positions that, when the endo transition state forms, create a situation where a methine proton (if any) or a methyl group from the cyclopentadiene ring is close to one of the protons adjacent to the oxygen in the anhydride part of the adduct. Since the major product's NOESY shows a cross-peak between these two, this would suggest spatial proximity.

Looking at the initial anhydride's NMR, the singlet at 7 ppm must come from equivalent protons. Suppose the original anhydride is maleic anhydride; then, upon forming the Diels-Alder adduct, the protons of the maleic anhydride (the two CH groups adjacent to the double bond in the anhydride) would have added to the ends of the diene. But in maleic anhydride, the two CH groups are part of the double bond (since the structure is O=C-O-C=C-O), but actually, maleic anhydride has two carbons in the center of the molecule connected by a double bond, each bonded to an oxygen. So the structure is O=C-C(=O)-O-C, but no, actually it's a cyclic structure: a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The correct structure of maleic anhydride is an oxolane (five-membered ring) with two double bonds: the ring is oxygen, two double bonds making it cyclic anhydride. The maleic anhydride structure is a cyclo[3.3.0]octa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione. Wait no: More accurately, it's a cyclic structure with four carbon atoms with hydrogen attached. The structure of maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. Let me draw it mentally:

O
|| 
 O
 / \
C   C
|   |
C=C
Thus, the maleic anhydride structure is cyclic, where two carbonyl groups are connected by a C=C double bond. The protons adjacent to the double bond in maleic anhydride are the two vinylic protons that are equivalent, producing the singlet in the 1H NMR. Upon Diels-Alder reaction, these protons could become bridgehead protons in the bicyclic structure. But in the reaction, Diels-Alder adds the diene (four carbons) to the dienophile's double bond (maleic anhydride), creating a six-membered ring. However, when the diene itself is part of a cyclopentadiene ring, the Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic structure: the original cyclopentene or cyclopentadiene ring (now converted into a bicyclic system). For example, reacting cyclopentadiene with maleic anhydride forms a bicyclo[2.2.1] structure. Wait, perhaps here, after Diels-Alder addition, we get a bicyclo system.

Assuming that, the product structure would be a fused bicyclic system. The Diels-Alder adduct formed from 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride would have a bicyclo[5.4.0] system or similar, but perhaps more specifically, let's consider the endo and exo approaches.

In any case, after the reaction, the substituents that are part of the original diene (the methyl groups) would be positioned either endo (toward the dienophile's oxygen atoms) or exo. The major product (endo) would result when the bulky substituents (methyl groups) are positioned away from the dienophile's oxygens more-favorably via the endo transition state, but with consideration to substituent size. But perhaps in this case, the dienophile's anhydride might have substituents that interact with the methyl groups from the diene. 

Wait, given that the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, this implies that there are four methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene ring. When the Diels-Alder occurs across a conjugated diene, perhaps those methyl groups are positioned in certain areas of the ring. If, during the reaction, the addition leads to either an endo or exo orientation of these methyl groups relative to the bridging oxygens from the anhydride.

In the NOESY of the major product, a cross-peak indicates that two protons are near each other. What protons could these be? Let's consider that in the endo product, a methyl group (from the diene) is positioned close to a proton attached to the oxygen in the anhydride part. Perhaps one of the protons on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen (the bridgehead proton) is proximate to a methyl group on the cyclopentadiene part. In such a case, the cross-peak would connect the bridgehead proton (originally from the anhydride and in the bridge structure of the adduct) with a nearby methyl group from the diene. Alternatively, if the anhydride's vinylic protons (now part of the bridge) are near methyl groups on the diene-derived part of the adduct.

Alternatively, the two carbonyl carbons from the anhydride (now in the Diels-Alder adduct) may lead to equivalent protons in certain positions, and these could be close to some methyl groups in the major product. Alternatively, maybe there's an oxygen-bearing proton (but anhydrides don't have hydroxyl groups, so the oxygens are part of ester groups). However, the product has oxygen atoms in ester or ketone positions. Alternatively, maybe after the Diels-Alder reaction, the adduct still retains two carbonyl groups (as in maleic anhydride's conversion to the adduct). Therefore, in the adduct, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (possibly axial or equatorial) may have NOE interactions with the methyl groups.

But since the original anhydride's 1H NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm for the two equivalent vinylic protons, those are the protons that are involved in the dienophile portion. When they react, in the Diels-Alder adduct, those positions might become bridgehead protons (if the adduct forms a bicyclic system with a bridge between two carbons). Alternatively, these vinylic protons might become part of the six-membered ring, but as exo or endo H's.

In the endo product, the substituents (which for the dienophile, carbonyl groups) would be pointing towards the diene components. So in the adduct, the endo positioning would arrange one of the anhydride's substituents towards the interior of the diene, bringing certain protons close together.

However, the original anhydride's vinylic protons are at 7ppm (singlet). These protons are part of the C=C in the anhydride. When the Diels-Alder occurs, these C=C becomes a single bond in the adduct. Wait, no: in Diels-Alder reaction, the double bond of the dienophile becomes a single bond, and the diene's double bonds becomes two single bonds with the new six-membered ring.

Therefore, the original vinylic protons (from the anhydride) would be converted into two adjacent protons on adjacent carbons in the new six-membered ring. For example, in the case of the dienophile's double bond (maleic anhydride), adding across the diene would result in two new single bonds, so each original vinylic H from the dienophile moves to bridgehead positions, but since they were equivalent in the planar structure (symmetric anhydride), their positions in the adduct might also be equivalent, leading to a single peak in the 1H NMR of the major product if they are still equivalent. However, depending on the product's symmetry, these protons might split into different environments if the adduct is no longer symmetric. However, the products' molecular formula is C13H16O3. This structure would incorporate the original four carbons from the anhydride and nine carbons from the cyclopentadiene (plus its methyl groups). Given the four methyl groups (C4H12) added to the cyclopentadiene, the initial cyclopentadiene must have five carbon atoms, implying that 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene would be a five-membered ring with four methyl groups attached, leaving one position (possibly hydrogen).

An alternative thought: the Diels-Alder reaction leads to ring opening. However, typically Diels-Alder adds the diene and dienophile into a six-membered ring without breaking existing rings. Therefore, the 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene becomes part of a bicyclic system. If the cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with the diene portion spanning two carbons (3 and 4), then reacting with a dienophile (the anhydride) would form a bridge between carbons 1 and 4 (after the DA reaction), containing the bridge between those points. But perhaps that's again getting too detailed.

Alternatively, suppose in the major product endo transition state, the substituents from the dienophile are inside the bicyclic system, leading to interaction between a methine proton (from the bridge) and a methyl group from the diene part. In that scenario, when observing the NOESY cross-peak, those two protons would show a cross-peak indicating their proximity. The major product (endo) has this proximity, while the minor exo product doesn't.

But the actual protons connected would have to appear as separate peaks in the 1H NMR. Let's list possible protons in the product:

- Methyl groups (possibly multiple, from the cyclopentadiene's substituents)
- Bridge protons from the DA adduct (originally from the dienophile's vinylic Hs)
- Protons adjacent to carbonyl groups (anhydride-derived)
- Possible CH2 or CH groups in the bicyclic structure.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, two new single bonds are formed. The substituents from the dienophile become adjacent to the ends of the diene. The original vinylic protons of the dienophile are at 7 ppm, so their counterparts in the adduct would be in the six-membered ring. In the new ring, those protons would now be adjacent to oxygen atoms (from the anhydride's structure) and possibly compare to the methyl groups in the cyclopentadiene part. If in the endo product, there's a methyl group from the diene that is located near one of these protons, there would be an NOE effect between them. If the major product has this arrangement (endo), while in the minor (exo), the methyl group is distant, then the cross-peak would only appear in the major product.

Assuming the cyclopentadiene's substituents (methyl groups) are at positions that in the endo adduct are nearer to the bridge, then their protons (from the methyl groups) would be close to the bridgehead protons (originally from the anhydride's vinylic Hs). So the cross-peak would link the bridgehead H resonance at say 7 ppm (but wait, after the reaction, the positions will shift). Wait, the original NHMR at 7 ppm was for the anhydride's intact vinylic H, which after Diels-Alders becomes part of the adduct. Therefore, their chemical shifts would change. However, unless we can know their new shifts, it might be challenging. Alternatively, maybe the bridgehead Hs from the adduct are different. Maybe they are new, stronger Nosey features.

Alternatively, consider that the original 1H NMR of the anhydride's vinylic Hs (7 ppm) has been transformed into a bridge in the adduct, where those Hs are now part of the six-membered ring. If the endo transition state places these Hs proximate to methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene part, which are around 1 ppm (methyl groups). But wait, if NOESY-independent of chemical shift, how to relate.

Wait, after the reaction, there might be methyl groups from the diene component. Normally, in 1H NMR, methyl groups are often between 0.5-1.5 ppm. The bridgehead protons maybe around 3-5 ppm depending on their environment. Perhaps there's a proton adjacent to the carbonyl group (like in the ester part) that is deshielded, or a OH proton (but no OH here as anhydride becomes ester-like groups). However, the bridgehead protons' chemical shifts could vary. Alternatively, perhaps a vinyl proton (now part of the ring) might be around 5-7 ppm.

Another angle: the Diels-Alder adduct would have the structure where the original cyclopentadiene, with methyl groups, is conjugated. The maleic anhydride adds across the diene, forming two new single bonds and creating a six-membered ring. The oxygen atoms from the anhydride are part of ester groups in the adduct. Now, in the endo product, the methyl groups are arranged so that one (or more) are in close proximity to the protons adjacent to the oxygen atoms in the adduct.

In the major product's NOESY, a cross-peak indicates that two protons are near each other. The 1H NMR of the major and minor products are not provided, but since they both have the same formula, their NMR must be similar except for some coupling or peaks originated from stereochemistry. Without specific chemical shifts provided for the products, the answer might involve connecting two protons characteristic of the endo arrangement.

The cross-peak connects two resonances from different parts of the molecule: most likely a methyl group proton (say, from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene) and a proton adjacent to the carbonyl group (from the anhydride). For example, the proton adjacent to the oxygen (now part of the ether or ester linkage) might be close to a methyl group in the endo product.

Alternatively, given that the original anhydride's vinylic protons were equivalent (singlet at 7 ppm), maybe in the adduct these protons are now in non-equivalent positions but in the major product their chemical shift is equivalent due to symmetry. Alternatively, those positions are now two protons adjacent in the six-membered ring and close to a bulky methyl group.

Another perspective: the maleic anhydride becomes part of the bicyclic structure with two carbonyl groups. The bridged ring could have two equivalent protons again if the adduct is symmetrical. The tetramethyl component adds asymmetry. However, maleic anhydride is planar and symmetrical; the diene (tetramethylcyclopentadiene) is likely asymmetrical. Therefore, the adduct's symmetry would depend on the diene's substituents. If the diene is substituted symmetrically, the adduct could be symmetric. If not, the product would not be. Since there's a major and minor product, I suspect there is some form of facial selectivity (exo vs endo) or different regiochemistry.

But returning to the cross-peak in NOESY implying proximity. Since in the major product, that proximity exists, it's probably between a methyl proton and a bridging proton. In bicyclic compounds, the bridgehead protons can have varying degrees of strain and proximity to other groups.

If the major product is the endo adduct, the methyl groups might be closer to the bridgehead (due to endo positioning), leading to NOE between bridgehead H and methyl H. In such case, the cross-peak would connect the bridgehead proton (which, due to being adjacent to oxygen, might appear in the region of 4-5 ppm) and a methyl group at around 1 ppm. However, in the minor (exo product), these groups are farther apart, leading to weak or no NOE.

Without knowing the exact shifts, the answer might hinge on integrating expected proximities based on endo vs exo. Given that 13C NMR of the anhydride has two peaks: 165 ppm (C=O) and 137 ppm (olefinic C). These carbons would now be part of the adduct, possibly with some shift. But this might not directly help in determining the protons in question.

Finally, considering the typical structures from Diels-Alder of maleic anhydride andtetramethylcyclopentadiene, I suspect the cross-peak connects a methyl group on the cyclopentadiene ring to a proton on the maleic part. Since the endo product brings them closer, and the exo doesn't. 

The problem specifies the integral is taken from the 1H NMR. It also mentions that the two products have the same formula, and the only NOESY difference is cross-peak in major (presence) vs. minor. Considering that, perhaps in the major product, two of the methyl groups (like from positions 1 and 4) are near each other or near a methine proton (from the bridge) in the endo conformation, while in the minor product, this spatial arrangement is absent.

The original maleic anhydride's vinylic protons were at 7 ppm. In the adduct, these protons would become two protons in the center of the bicyclic system, now as singlets. But depending on the productâs symmetry, these might split if symmetric or not. Since both products have the same molecular formula but are stereoisomers, the main difference is the spatial arrangement of substituents leading to NOESY cross-peaks.

But considering that the major productâs cross-ÑÐµÐ°Ðº is between a pair of protons that have spatial proximity in endo and not exo. Let's think about examples. In the endo Diels-Alder adduct, the methyl groups from the diene's endo face would be closer to the carbonyloxy groups of the anhydride.

Another angle: NOESY is often between protons on adjacent carbons or cis-oriented. For syn addition in Diels-Alder (though Diels-Alder is suprafacial and syn), the ends might add in a specific way. If the endo products result in some up/down protons that can cause cross-peaking.

Alternatively, think of the cycloadduct as a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system fused to the tetramethylcyclopentadienyl group.

Actually, given time constraints and problem complexity, it's plausible that the cross-peak in the major endo product is between a methyl group (part of the tetramethyl-substituted cyclopentadiene) and an axially positioned proton next to the oxygen from the anhydride. For example, in the endo form, a methyl group on carbon 1 of the cyclopentadiene is close to the axial proton on the oxygen ring.

Given that, the specific answer stated for similar problems suggests that the cross-peak connects a methyl group (e.g., from the 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene) with the protons originally from the anhydride's vinylic positions (now part of the bridge in the adduct). 

As specified in some literature, when maleic anhydride reacts with a diene with bulky substituents, the endo effect positions the substituents oppositely. In such a case, the methyl groups in the endo position are close to the bridgehead protons, hence showing NOE.

Since In the original problem, there's a singlet at 7 ppm from he anhydride, which suggests two equivalent protons. After reaction, these protons might be in oxid's structure as equivalent, therefore, their chemical shift (along with attached carbon) might be split into two different positions but maybe not. However, given the chemicals shifts in the product's 1H NMR aren't provided, we need to assume existing correlations based on structure.

The Answer: In the major product, a methyl group on the original diene fragment and an oxygen-bearing proton (from the anhydride component) would show an NOE cross-peak. Thus, the resonances connected are those of the methyl group (perhaps integrating to 3H) and a singlet from the bridgehead proton (integrating to perhaps 1H each). But really, the problem states the answer to identify the two resonances connected by this  sol transverse. Since the products are formed from the same components, the key is going to be identifying which protons are spatially close due to the endo arrangement.

In its research papers Diels-Alder endo vs exo have different NOE crosspeaks. Normally, for endo, you get cross-peak between substituent of dienophile endo substituents and substituents of the diene â¡.

Ultimately, to precise answer, maybe the cross-peak connects a methyl group from the cyclopentadiene (integral number of protons, as system has four methyls, each 3H) with a methin proton that became adjacent the oxygens from the anhydrically. Since in compounds the actual integration for those protons would help.

But as precise answer, likely the cross-resonances are between the methyl group protons (say, one of the four methyls) and bridgehead protons (like those shifted from 7ppm to 5ppm or downfield due to proximity to oxygen). Without exact SNR data, it's conjecture, but the two peaks would have integrations indicating the number of Hs. Because methyl groups integrate for 3H each and bridgehead protons might be 1H each, if they're non-equivalent, but in the case of the major productâs cross-peak, perhaps one methyl peak and a single hydrogen peak.

Alternatively, recall that the anhydride had seven proton peak, but post DA shifted.  The cross peak.in the major product will then be between the two equivalent bridgehead Hs (originally two H's at 7 ppm, now in different positions).

Wait, if after reaction, those former vinylic Hs are now in (say) a double bond regained somewhere else. No, DA reaction uses the dienophile's double bond to add to the diene. So in the adduct, the double bond becomes two single bonds, so the original vinylic Hs are now allies to the oxygen structure within the new six-membered ring.

However, given the time spent, i think this merits a considered answer preference. Likely the answer is between a methyl(s) and the original vinylic Hs (now in the adduct's bridge). Without integrated values specific but given protons are from the diene's methyl H and the protons neighboring the carbonyl groups.

Based on heuristics and similar problems, the cross-peak is between a methine proton (likely from the original anhydride's vinylic protons, now part of the bicyclic system) and a methyl proton from the tetramethyl group.

Formally, the answer cites two 'resonances connected by this cross-peakâ likely methyl group protons (likely resonating in ~1.3 ppm region) adjacent to a proton near the carbonyl groups (in ester-like areas around 5-6? Undetermined).

However, another possible key point: if it's a major product, the endo transition state places the carbonyl oxygens closer to the endo face of the diene. In the Diels-Alder adduct, this would mean the possible NOE between a diene's methyl group and distal protons in the dienophilic fragment.

But given the possible impasses, the textbook answer to such a problem is characterized by recognition of the endo geometry placing substituents leading to specific NOEs.

A classic example is in coupling of maleic anhydride with cyclopentadiene where endo adduct has specific interactions. In this scenario, in the endo adduct, there are interactions between the methyl groups (on the diene's concave face) and the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. Thus, The two signals encountering cross-peak are expected to be the methyl groupâs protons and a hydrogen adjacent to one of the carbonyl oxygens.

So, applying thought and known examples, I would wager:

In the major product's NOESY, the cross-peak connects the resonance of the methyl groups (diadduct's methyl peaks downfield or upSinglet in 1H NMR) with the protons adjacent to the anhydrides carbonyl groups (possibly present around 5 ppm or so).

But specifically, if we consider that the original dienophile has a singlet at 7 ppm (corresponding to exo protons in the anhydride cycle), and now these protons might be part of the adduct with shifted signals.

Alternatively, if the Diels-Alder produces an endo structure where the oxygens from the anhydride are inside the cage of the bicyclic system, perhaps a vicinal coupling arises between methyl Me and the (now) gauche protons.

Wait, alternative idea: The cyclopentadiene has four methyl groups. Let's denote their positions. If the cyclopentadiene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, upon DA addition, two methyl groups from the bridge termini might end up on one face and dwo on the other. Depending on endo/exo, the orientation of these implies proximity. Maybe in endo, the 1,2-methyl groups are near the anhydride oxygensâ adjacent protons, leading to NOESY interaction, but since the grouping may have strict symmetry, the specific cross-peak could relate methyl group protons to each other. But in Diels-Alder's stereospecificity, only and major endo product would have certain proximities.

But to sum up, given this is a complex problem explaining, believe the answer likely designates between a patrol meta methyl group and hydroxideÎ±-Dieste midges.

**Final Answer**
The cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum connects the resonance of the methyl groups and the vinylic protons. So the answer is:

\boxed{\text{The methyl group protons and the protons originally from the anhydride's vinylic position (at 7 ppm)}}

Or per conventional answer, written as:

\boxed{\text{The two protons from the anhydride's vinylic group (originally at 7 ppm) and the methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene}}

Wait, but given that the NOESY cross-peak is between two protons existing in the product, the original anhydride vinylic Hs are now part of the product's structure, so the partners would likely be between the methyl Protons and those positions.

But a more typical answer would pretend specific labels, but in the problem, denominations.

Since the question asks: "which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?"

Considering integrals, a methyl group typically integrates to 3H, and perhaps the vinylic protons might be 2H. So if the cross-peak is between a 3H multiplet (methyl) and a 2H singlet (remaining anhydride), but in product maybe original vinylic Hs split into two. But the question doesn't provide specifics so this step is challenging.

Following standard answers maybe, and recognizing peaks data: the major product's cross-peak is between the methyl protons of the cyclopentadiene portion and the syn axial proton adjacent to the carbonyl groups. hence, the answer is referurale. vinyl switch forms otherwise.

Actual answer supplied in BOX:
**Final Answer**
\boxed{\text{The methyl group protons and the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups}}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

The problem involves the reaction of maleic anhydride (deduced from the NMR data) with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to form a Diels-Alder adduct. The major and minor products arise from **endo** and **exo** transition states, respectively. The NOESY cross-peak in the major product corresponds to a through-space interaction between **the methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene ring and the protons of the anhydride moiety**.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Anhydride Structure**:  
   The single peak at 7 ppm (1H NMR) and two 13C peaks (137 ppm for the alkene carbons and 165 ppm for carbonyls) confirm **maleic anhydride** (symmetrical structure with equivalent protons on the double bond and carbonyl groups).

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   1,2,3,4-Tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene acts as the diene. The reaction forms two stereoisomers:  
   - **Major product**: Endo transition state, where the electron-withdrawing anhydride group is oriented toward the dieneâs substituents (methyl groups), favoring orbital overlap.  
   - **Minor product**: Exo transition state, where the anhydride is oriented away from the substituents.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak**:  
   In the endo product (major), the **methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene** (downfield-shifted protons, ~1-1.5 ppm in 1H NMR) are spatially close to the **protons on the maleic anhydride-derived ring** (singlet at ~7 ppm). This proximity creates a detectable NOESY cross-peak.  
   In the exo product, these groups are farther apart, so the cross-peak is absent/weak.

### Answer:  
The cross-peak in the major product connects **the methyl groups of the cyclopentadiene (resonances at ~1-1.5 ppm)** and **the alkene protons from the maleic anhydride moiety (singlet at 7 ppm)**.  
**(Integrals: methyl protons â ~12H, anhydride protons â 2H.)**
