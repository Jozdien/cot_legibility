# Original Question

You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?

The observed NMR and LC-MS results for the synthesized peptide can be explained by **cis-trans isomerization** at a proline peptide bond. Here's the breakdown:

1. **NMR Analysis**:  
   - Two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and combined integral of 1H suggest two populations of the molecule in solution. These peaks cannot arise from spin-spin coupling (ruled out by the coupling pattern).  
   - The two populations are likely **slowly interconverting isomers** on the NMR timescale, causing separate peaks. Each isomer induces a slightly different chemical environment for the alpha-proton, leading to distinct shifts. The near-equal integrals indicate a roughly 50:50 ratio of the isomers.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:  
   - At elevated temperature, two peaks with the same mass (consistent with the expected compound) but different retention times are observed. This separation implies distinct chemical structures with identical molecular weights—**diastereomers** or **conformational isomers**.  
   - The equal peak intensities in LC-MS align with the NMR integrals, supporting a 1:1 ratio of the two species.

3. **Key Explanation**:  
   Proline residues in peptides are prone to **cis-trans isomerization** of their peptide bonds. Unlike other amino acids, proline's cyclic side chain lowers the energy barrier between cis and trans configurations, allowing both forms to exist in equilibrium. During synthesis, proline-containing peptides often form a mixture of cis and trans isomers.  
   - The cis and trans isomers are diastereomers with different physicochemical properties (e.g., hydrophobicity), leading to distinct retention times in LC-MS.  
   - In NMR, the slow interconversion (relative to the NMR timescale) at ambient temperature results in separate peaks, while elevated temperature in LC-MS stabilizes the separation of isomers during chromatography.

**Conclusion**: The duplication of peaks in NMR and LC-MS is best explained by **cis-trans isomerization of a proline peptide bond** in the synthesized compound. This is a common phenomenon in peptide chemistry and accounts for both the spectroscopic and chromatographic observations.

Okay, so I need to figure out the reason behind the observed NMR and LC-MS results for this synthesized peptide. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound mostly looks like what's expected, except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what's expected for that proton. The coupling pattern doesn't explain the splitting, so spin-spin coupling is ruled out. Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks with equal intensities, same mass. 

Hmm. Since LC-MS at elevated temperature separates the compounds based on their retention time, but they have the same mass, that probably means they are structural isomers or some form of conformers. But wait, in LC-MS, if the mass is the same, they might be isomers. Since it's a peptidic compound, maybe there's a peptide bond that can have cis-trans isomerism? Proline comes to mind because it can cause cis-trans isomerization in peptide bonds. Proline's peptide bonds can adopt cis or trans configurations because the nitrogen is part of a ring, making the energy barrier between cis and trans lower. So, these two peaks in LC-MS might be the cis and trans isomers of a proline-containing peptide. 

But how does that relate to the NMR? In the NMR spectrum, two peaks for the same alpha-proton. If there are two isomers (cis and trans), each isomer would have a slightly different chemical environment around that alpha-proton, leading to two distinct chemical shifts. Since they are separate isomers, their peaks would be two singlets (or not split by coupling, as the problem states coupling isn't the reason). The integrals add up to 1H because each isomer contributes half of the total integral for that proton. At elevated temperature in LC-MS, maybe the two isomers interconvert slowly at lower temperatures, but when heated, they separate due to different retention times. However, the problem says the LC-MS was done at elevated temperature and shows two peaks. Sometimes heating can increase the rate of interconversion, but maybe the column is heated, and under those conditions, they interconvert rapidly. Wait, but if they interconverted rapidly, the LC-MS would merge into one peak, right? If they are separating into two peaks, that suggests that they are stable under those conditions and don't interconvert during the analysis. So, cis-trans isomers would be a likely explanation. Proline's cis-trans isomerization is a common issue in peptide synthesis. The two isomers would have slightly different retention times on HPLC. But NMR might show two peaks if the interconversion is slow on the NMR timescale. At room temperature, the NMR would see two distinct peaks if the isomers don't interconvert quickly, but when heating in the LC-MS, perhaps the separation occurs because they are stable and have different interactions with the column. But the LC-MS would show two separate peaks, each with the same mass (since they're isomers), but different retention times. And since their concentration is equal (equal integrals in NMR and equal intensities in LC-MS), that makes sense for a 50:50 mixture, which is common for cis-trans isomerization in some cases where the equilibrium isn't shifted. Proline cis-trans can sometimes have a ratio around that if there’s no preference. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another type of isomerism. Could it be racemization? Racemization would form D- and L-amino acid residues, but the mass would stay the same. In LC-MS, if the column is chiral, they would separate. However, more commonly, racemization in peptides during synthesis is a possibility, but standard LC-MS might not separate enantiomers unless a chiral column is used. The problem doesn't specify a chiral column, but maybe it is? Or maybe the molecule has multiple chiral centers, leading to diastereomers. Wait, but if it's diastereomers, they would have different masses if the number of amino acids is different? No, diastereomers would have the same molecular formula, so same mass. However, diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC. But racemization of a single amino acid would create an epimer, which is a diastereomer. For example, if one amino acid in the peptide was racemized during synthesis, leading to two diastereomeric peptides. In that case, the NMR would show different shifts for the alpha-protons near the site of racemization, and LC-MS would separate them. However, that would mean that during synthesis, a side reaction (racemization) occurred. But why would both isomers be present in equal amounts? Racemization during synthesis might not necessarily be 50:50 unless it reached equilibrium. Alternatively, if the coupling was not optimized and racemization occurred, maybe. But cis-trans isomerism might be more likely to give equal populations, especially proline. Proline's cis-trans isomerization can lead to a roughly 30-70 ratio (for trans being more favorable usually in peptides), but maybe in some cases, the equilibrium is closer to 50:50. However, during chemical synthesis, I believe cis-trans isomerization in proline might generate a mixture that is then difficult to separate. So when they synthesized the peptide, maybe some proline residues were inserted with cis configuration and others with trans, creating a mixture. However, the crude compound has both. If proline's peptide bond is in cis or trans, the resulting peptides would be diastereomers, and so would have different retention times in LC-MS, and different NMR shifts. Both would have the same mass. Alternatively, perhaps during the synthesis, the peptide chain was cleaved and there's an error – no, the LC-MS shows same mass. 

Another possibility: rotameric states. But those would usually interconvert rapidly on the NMR timescale and not split into separate peaks. So NMR would average them. If two peaks, they are exchanging slowly. So, cis-trans isomerization of a peptide bond (like involving proline) would be a likely source of slow exchange. Then in the NMR spectrum, each isomer has a different alpha-proton environment, giving separate peaks with equal integral (if 50:50 ratio). LC-MS at high temp would separate them into two peaks, same mass. So the explanation is cis-trans isomerism at a proline peptide bond. I think this is the answer.

I need to determine the underlying cause of the observed NMR and LC-MS results for this peptide synthesis. Let me examine the provided data systematically.

Initially, examining the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude product, it generally matches expectations with one notable exception: a single alpha-proton appears as two separate peaks. These peaks show similar chemical shifts, and when their integrals are combined, they equal 1H, which is the expected value for this proton. The splitting pattern doesn't align with spin-spin coupling effects, eliminating this as a potential explanation. Additionally, LC-MS analysis conducted at higher temperature reveals two peaks with identical intensities and masses.

Since the LC-MS separates compounds based on retention time while showing identical masses, this suggests we're looking at either structural isomers or conformational variants. For peptide compounds specifically, cis-trans isomerism of peptide bonds is a likely explanation. Proline residues are particularly notable in this context, as they commonly exhibit cis-trans isomerization in peptide bonds. The cyclic structure of proline incorporates the nitrogen into a ring, which lowers the energy barrier between cis and trans configurations.

This cis-trans isomerism would also explain the NMR observations. If the peptide exists as two isomers (cis and trans forms), the alpha-proton in each isomer would experience slightly different chemical environments, resulting in two distinct signals with similar chemical shifts. Since these isomers are se

I need to determine the cause behind the observed NMR and LC-MS results for the synthesized peptide. I'll start by analyzing the information provided.

Firstly, the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound generally appears as predicted, except for two peaks associated with the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts, and their integrals sum to 1H, which is expected for that proton. The splitting can't be explained by the coupling pattern, so spin-spin coupling isn't the cause. Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperatures displays two peaks with the same intensity and identical mass.

Since LC-MS at elevated temperatures separates compounds based on retention time and they have the same mass, it's likely they are structural isomers or conformers. However, if the mass is identical in LC-MS, they might be isomers. Given that it's a peptide, there could be a peptide bond capable of cis-trans isomerism. Proline comes to mind because it can cause cis-trans isomerization in peptide bonds. Proline's peptide bonds can adopt cis or trans configurations because the nitrogen is part of a ring, which lowers the energy barrier between cis and trans forms. Therefore, the two peaks in LC-MS might correspond to the cis and trans isomers of a proline-containing peptide.

How does this relate to the NMR? In the NMR spectrum, there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. If there are two isomers (cis and trans), each isomer would create a slightly different chemical environment around the alpha-proton, resulting in two distinct chemical shifts.

And each isomer would contribute a peak with integral 0.5H each, adding to 1H total. But why would the LC-MS at elevated temperature show two peaks? Oh, wait, elevated temperature might cause faster interconversion between cis and trans, but if the LC method uses high temperature, maybe the isomers are interconverting less on the timescale of the LC run. Wait, actually, elevated temperature usually increases the rate of interconversion. But in the case of proline cis-trans isomerization, even at higher temps, if the barrier is high enough, you might still get separation. Wait, no. If the temperature is high, the isomers might interconvert too quickly for the LC column to separate them, resulting in a single peak. But the user says LC-MS at elevated temp shows two peaks. So perhaps the temperature during LC is lower than the melting temp for the isomerization. Wait, but the problem states "elevated temperature". Maybe the elevated temperature is not so high as to allow rapid interconversion. Alternatively, perhaps the peptide isn\'t proline, but another amino acid with a similar issue?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two peaks in LC-MS are due to another type of isomerism, like epimerization. For example, if the synthesis caused some racemization at a chiral center, resulting in D and L isomers. But in amino acids, except for glycine, others are chiral, so if during synthesis, some racemization occurred at a specific residue, that would create diastereomers. However, diastereomers usually have different masses, but wait, in this case, the mass is the same, as both peaks have same mass spectrum. So that can\'t be it because epimers would have same molecular formula and hence same mass. But they would be diastereomers, hence separable by LC. But wait, the alpha-proton in the amino acid is adjacent to the chiral center. If there is racemization at that position, then in NMR, the alpha-proton would have different chemical shifts in the two diastereomers. So then, the two LC peaks would be the two diastereomers (D and L at that position), each giving a separate peak in LC, same mass, different retention times. And in the NMR, each would have their own alpha-proton peaks, summing to 1H. But would both diastereomers be present in equal amounts? If racemization occurred, forming 50:50 mixture, then the integrals would add up. However, during peptide synthesis, racemization can occur, especially if the coupling conditions were harsh. So that could lead to presence of both D and L forms at a certain residue, leading to diastereomers with same mass but different retention times. But wait, if the peptide is small, let\'s say a dipeptide, with one of the amino acids having undergone racemization, then they are diastereomers and would elute at different times. However, NMR would show separate peaks for the alpha protons. So that could fit.\n\nAlternatively, another possibility is the presence of rotamers. But rotamers generally interconvert rapidly on the NMR timescale, leading to averaged signals. However, if there is hindered rotation, like in tertiary amides or other structures with restricted rotation, maybe that creates atropisomers. But in such cases, would they give separate peaks in LC-MS?\n\nAlternatively, another possibility is the presence of different protecting groups, but if it\'s the same mass, that\'s not possible. So they aren\'t deprotected or partially protected.\n\nWait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So same molecular formula. Diastereomers (like from racemization) are possible. Cis-trans isomerization, same mass. So either could work.\n\nSo the question is, which scenario would lead to two peaks in LC with same mass and two alpha-proton peaks with similar shifts and no coupling. For cis-trans isomerism, in the case of proline, the cis and trans forms would have different chemical environments, leading to different shifts for nearby protons. For example, the alpha-proton adjacent to the proline might have different shifts in cis vs. trans. Since the peptide is small, these isomers might be in slow exchange on the NMR timescale, leading to two distinct peaks. But wait, if the interconversion between cis and trans is slow, then in the LC, they would elute as two separate peaks. At elevated temperature, if that accelerates interconversion, you might see coalescence. But the problem states that at elevated temperature, two peaks appear. Wait, but when you run LC at higher temperature, maybe the column temperature is raised, which could increase the speed of isomerization. However, cis and trans proline peptides often have high energy barriers, so even at elevated temperatures they may not interconvert during the LC run. So the LC would separate them into two peaks. Alternatively, if the run is at higher temperature, maybe their retention times are affected but the separation is still there.\n\nAlternatively, for racemization, the two diastereomers (D and L) would have same mass, different retention times. So when synthesized, if there\'s partial racemization, you get 50:50. In NMR, the two diastereomers would produce separate peaks for the alpha protons because the environment is different. So integrals would add up. So that\'s another possible case.\n\nHow can we differentiate between cis-trans isomerism and racemization?\n\nIn the case of cis-trans isomerism, perhaps another proton in the structure, like amide protons, would show splitting, but since it\'s a peptide, amide protons are usually exchanged in D2O. Wait, but the problem mentions alpha protons. So let\'s say if the compound has a proline residue, which forms a cis or trans peptide bond. The alpha proton of the residue preceding proline (since proline is an imino acid, its own alpha proton is part of the ring) would be influenced by the cis or trans configuration. For example, in the trans configuration, the alpha-proton from the previous amino acid would be in a different environment compared to cis.\n\nAlternatively, if the racemization occurs at an amino acid residue (non-proline) during synthesis, leading to D and L forms, which are diastereomers. For a peptide with a chiral center that\'s racemized, that would also produce diastereomers.\n\nSo the challenge is distinguishing between these two possibilities.\n\nThe key here might be the LC-MS conditions. If the LC is run at elevated temperature and two peaks are observed with equal intensity, that suggests that the two species are not interconverting during the analysis. So that suggests that the interconversion rate is slow on the LC timescale.\n\nFor cis-trans isomerization, the barrier is generally high enough that interconversion is slow at room temperature, but at elevated temperatures, maybe it\'s faster. Hmm, the problem says LC-MS analysis is done at elevated temperature and the peaks are separated. So even at elevated temp, they are separated, meaning that the interconversion is still slow. Similarly, with racemization, once the diastereomer is formed, unless there\'s a catalyst, racemization doesn\'t occur, so they would remain as separate.\n\nBut cis-trans would form faster under certain conditions, especially if the peptide is not too rigid.\n\nAnother point is that the integrals in NMR add up to 1H. If there\'s a 50:50 mixture, that would produce two peaks each with integral 0.5. That suggests that the two forms are present in equal amounts. Racemization would produce equal amounts of D and L, which is common if the synthesis led to partial racemization. Similarly, cis and trans isomers of proline can also form in roughly equal amounts during synthesis, depending on conditions, but sometimes the trans form is more favored. However, if the conditions during synthesis lead to a 50:50 mixture of cis and trans, which is possible for certain sequences.\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that the two peaks in NMR have similar chemical shifts. If it\'s due to cis-trans isomerism, the shifts are similar but distinct; if it\'s racemization, the shifts might be more different? Maybe not necessarily. It depends on the exact structural changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it\'s due to the presence of a diastereomeric mixture from a different source, like a stereoisomer in a non-peptide bond part. But given it\'s a peptide, the most likely sources are either racemization or cis-trans isomerization.\n\nConsidering the case of cis-trans isomerism in proline, this is a common issue in peptide synthesis. The peptide bonds involving proline can exist as cis or trans, and during synthesis, both can form. In solution, they can interconvert, but slowly. So in an NMR spectrum, unless it\'s at high temperature, the cis and trans forms would result in separate peaks. Similarly, in an HPLC, if the temperature isn\'t high enough to cause rapid interconversion, there would be two peaks. But wait, even at elevated temperatures, if the barrier is high, they might still separate.\n\nAlternatively, raising the temperature in LC might actually denature the peptide or affect the column\'s interaction, but that might not necessarily affect the isomerization rate. But probably, isomerization rate depends on the solution conditions and temperature before injection. But if during the LC run, they flow through the column at high temperature, any in-column isomerization would cause coalescence.\n\nAlternatively, in the scenario posed, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. That suggests two compounds are present in equal amounts and do not interconvert during LC analysis.\n\nSo, considering this, cis-trans isomerism (proline) and racemization are the main possibilities. \n\nAnother thought: in the case of cis-trans isomerism, other protons besides the alpha-proton would show splitting. But the question says that the only anomaly is these two peaks for the alpha-proton. If the rest of the NMR is as expected, maybe it\'s more localized. For example, racemization at a single amino acid would result in diastereomers, which could affect multiple protons, but perhaps the primary noticeable effect in the NMR is on the alpha-proton. Whereas, cis-trans isomerism would affect the backbone conformation more, thus causing different shifts for protons adjacent to the peptide bond, such as the alpha-proton on the adjacent residue. So if a residue adjacent to proline has the alpha-proton split into two peaks, that might line up.\n\nAlternatively, if the proline is at position n, then the peptide bond between n-1 and n can be cis or trans. The alpha-proton from residue n-1 would be close to that peptide bond. Cis vs trans could differentially shield or deshield that proton, leading to two separate peaks in NMR. And in LC-MS at high temp, you might still have separation. Hence, if the two isomers are present in equal amounts, they would split into two peaks in LC-MS with same mass. \n\nOn the other hand, racemization leads to diastereomers. In diastereomers, more structural differences, so other protons might be affected, but the problem statement mentions only the alpha-proton shows two peaks, everything else is fine. But maybe the rest of the molecule is not affected because only a single stereocenter was inverted, and the rest are the same. For instance, if only one amino acid in the chain is racemized, perhaps the rest are the same, so only the alpha-proton from that residue is split. \n\nHowever, cis-trans isomerism could also just affect that specific alpha-proton. Maybe that\'s possible.\n\nBut given both options are possible, maybe the key is that the answer (as per typical exam questions) is cis-trans isomerism about a proline peptide bond. I recall that cis-trans isomerism in peptides with proline is a common issue leading to two peaks in HPLC with same mass, and split signals in NMR. Racemization is less likely if the synthesis conditions are standard, but it\'s possible. Unless the question specifies something else. But without more info, cis-trans is more commonly the cause.\n\nSo, putting it all together: two peaks in LC-MS same mass but different retention times, which can be explained by isomers. Two peaks in NMR for the same alpha-proton, same integral sum, no coupling. Since coupling is excluded, spin-spin isn\'t the cause. Therefore, the two species in solution, each contributing their own peaks. Since LC shows two species but same mass, it\'s either cis-trans isomerism or racemization (diastereomer). However, cis-trans around proline is a classic problem. Hence, the answer is the presence of cis and trans isomers of a proline peptide bond, which account for the two peaks in both NMR and LC-MS.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743847771, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3092, prompt_tokens=482, total_tokens=3574, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The most likely explanation for the observed NMR and LC-MS results is **cis-trans isomerism around a proline peptide bond** in the synthesized peptide. Here's the reasoning:

1. **NMR Observations**: The two peaks for the alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts and combined integral of 1H indicate two distinct environments for the same proton. Since spin-spin coupling is ruled out, this suggests the presence of two slowly interconverting species in solution. Proline-containing peptides often exhibit cis-trans isomerism at the peptide bond, where the alpha-proton of the adjacent residue experiences a different chemical environment depending on whether the proline peptide bond is in the cis or trans configuration. These isomers interconvert slowly on the NMR timescale, leading to separate peaks.

2. **LC-MS Observations**: The two peaks with equal intensity and identical mass spectra correspond to the same molecular formula but different retention times. This is consistent with cis and trans isomers, which have the same mass but distinct three-dimensional structures, leading to different chromatographic behaviors. Even at elevated temperatures, the energy barrier for cis-trans isomerization in proline is high enough to prevent rapid interconversion during LC analysis, allowing separation into two peaks.

3. **Racemization vs. Cis-Trans Isomerism**: While racemization at a chiral center could produce diastereomers with the same mass and different retention times, this would typically affect more protons in the NMR spectrum (not just the alpha-proton). Cis-trans isomerism, particularly involving proline, is a more localized effect and aligns with the observation of two alpha-proton signals without significant anomalies elsewhere in the NMR spectrum.

**Conclusion**: The data are best explained by the presence of cis and trans isomers of a proline residue in the peptide, arising during synthesis due to the hindered rotation of the proline peptide bond. These isomers persist as distinct species in both NMR and LC-MS analyses under the described conditions.

perate compounds (different isomers), the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton in different environments. And each isomer would contribute a peak with integral 0.5H each, adding to 1H total.

Wait, actually, elevated temperature usually increases the rate of interconversion. But in the case of proline cis-trans isomerization, even at higher temps, if the barrier is high enough, you might still get separation. Wait, no.

So perhaps the temperature during LC is lower than the melting temp for the isomerization. Wait, but the problem states "elevated temperature". Maybe the elevated temperature is not so high as to allow rapid interconversion. Alternatively, perhaps the peptide isn't proline, but another amino acid with a similar issue?

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks in LC-MS are due to another type of isomerism, like epimerization. For example, if the synthesis caused some racemization at a chiral center, resulting in D and L isomers. But in amino acids, except for glycine, others are chiral, so if during synthesis, some racemization occurred at a specific residue, that would create diastereomers. However, diastereomers usually have different masses, but wait, in this case, the mass is the same, as both peaks have same mass spectrum. So that can't be it because epimers would have same molecular formula and hence same mass. But they would be diastereomers, hence separable by LC. But wait, the alpha-proton in the amino acid is adjacent to the chiral center. If there is racemization at that position, then in NMR, the alpha-proton would have different chemical shifts in the two diastereomers. So then, the two LC peaks would be the two diastereomers (D and L at that position), each giving a separate peak in LC, same mass, different retention times. And in the NMR, each would have their own alpha-proton peaks, summing to 1H. But would both diastereomers be present in equal amounts? If racemization occurred, forming 50:50 mixture, then the integrals would add up. However, during peptide synthesis, racemization can occur, especially if the coupling conditions were harsh. So that could lead to presence of both D and L forms at a certain residue, leading to diastereomers with same mass but different retention times. But wait, if the peptide is small, let's say a dipeptide, with one of the amino acids having undergone racemization, then they are diastereomers and would elute at different times. However, NMR would show separate peaks for the alpha protons. So that could fit.

Alternatively, another possibility is the presence of rotamers. But rotamers generally interconvert rapidly on the NMR timescale, leading to averaged signals. However, if there is hindered rotation, like in tertiary amides or other structures with restricted rotation, maybe that creates atropisomers. But in such cases, would they give separate peaks in LC-MS?

Alternatively, another possibility is the presence of different protecting groups, but if it's the same mass, that's not possible. So they aren't deprotected or partially protected.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So same molecular formula. Diastereomers (like from racemization) are possible. Cis-trans isomerization, same mass. So either could work.

So the question is, which scenario would lead to two peaks in LC with same mass and two alpha-proton peaks with similar shifts and no coupling. For cis-trans isomerism, in the case of proline, the cis and trans forms would have different chemical environments, leading to different shifts for nearby protons. For example, the alpha-proton adjacent to the proline might have different shifts in cis vs. trans. Since the peptide is small, these isomers might be in slow exchange on the NMR timescale, leading to two distinct peaks. But wait, if the interconversion between cis and trans is slow, then in the LC, they would elute as two separate peaks. At elevated temperature, if that accelerates interconversion, you might see coalescence. But the problem states that at elevated temperature, two peaks appear. Wait, but when you run LC at higher temperature, maybe the column temperature is raised, which could increase the speed of isomerization. However, cis and trans proline peptides often have high energy barriers, so even at elevated temperatures they may not interconvert during the LC run. So the LC would separate them into two peaks. Alternatively, if the run is at higher temperature, maybe their retention times are affected but the separation is still there.

Alternatively, for racemization, the two diastereomers (D and L) would have same mass, different retention times. So when synthesized, if there's partial racemization, you get 50:50. In NMR, the two diastereomers would produce separate peaks for the alpha protons because the environment is different. So integrals would add up. So that's another possible case.

How can we differentiate between cis-trans isomerism and racemization?

In the case of cis-trans isomerism, perhaps another proton in the structure, like amide protons, would show splitting, but since it's a peptide, amide protons are usually exchanged in D2O. Wait, but the problem mentions alpha protons. So let's say if the compound has a proline residue, which forms a cis or trans peptide bond. The alpha proton of the residue preceding proline (since proline is an imino acid, its own alpha proton is part of the ring) would be influenced by the cis or trans configuration. For example, in the trans configuration, the alpha-proton from the previous amino acid would be in a different environment compared to cis.

Alternatively, if the racemization occurs at an amino acid residue (non-proline) during synthesis, leading to D and L forms, which are diastereomers. For a peptide with a chiral center that's racemized, that would also produce diastereomers.

So the challenge is distinguishing between these two possibilities.

The key here might be the LC-MS conditions. If the LC is run at elevated temperature and two peaks are observed with equal intensity, that suggests that the two species are not interconverting during the analysis. So that suggests that the interconversion rate is slow on the LC timescale.

For cis-trans isomerization, the barrier is generally high enough that interconversion is slow at room temperature, but at elevated temperatures, maybe it's faster. Hmm, the problem says LC-MS analysis is done at elevated temperature and the peaks are separated. So even at elevated temp, they are separated, meaning that the interconversion is still slow. Similarly, with racemization, once the diastereomer is formed, unless there's a catalyst, racemization doesn't occur, so they would remain as separate.

But cis-trans would form faster under certain conditions, especially if the peptide is not too rigid.

Another point is that the integrals in NMR add up to 1H. If there's a 50:50 mixture, that would produce two peaks each with integral 0.5. That suggests that the two forms are present in equal amounts. Racemization would produce equal amounts of D and L, which is common if the synthesis led to partial racemization. Similarly, cis and trans isomers of proline can also form in roughly equal amounts during synthesis, depending on conditions, but sometimes the trans form is more favored. However, if the conditions during synthesis lead to a 50:50 mixture of cis and trans, which is possible for certain sequences.

Additionally, the problem states that the two peaks in NMR have similar chemical shifts. If it's due to cis-trans isomerism, the shifts are similar but distinct; if it's racemization, the shifts might be more different? Maybe not necessarily. It depends on the exact structural changes.

Alternatively, maybe it's due to the presence of a diastereomeric mixture from a different source, like a stereoisomer in a non-peptide bond part. But given it's a peptide, the most likely sources are either racemization or cis-trans isomerization.

Considering the case of cis-trans isomerism in proline, this is a common issue in peptide synthesis. The peptide bonds involving proline can exist as cis or trans, and during synthesis, both can form. In solution, they can interconvert, but slowly. So in an NMR spectrum, unless it's at high temperature, the cis and trans forms would result in separate peaks. Similarly, in an HPLC, if the temperature isn't high enough to cause rapid interconversion, there would be two peaks. But wait, even at elevated temperatures, if the barrier is high, they might still separate.

Alternatively, raising the temperature in LC might actually denature the peptide or affect the column's interaction, but that might not necessarily affect the isomerization rate. But probably, isomerization rate depends on the solution conditions and temperature before injection. But if during the LC run, they flow through the column at high temperature, any in-column isomerization would cause coalescence.

Alternatively, in the scenario posed, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity. That suggests two compounds are present in equal amounts and do not interconvert during LC analysis.

So, considering this, cis-trans isomerism (proline) and racemization are the main possibilities. 

Another thought: in the case of cis-trans isomerism, other protons besides the alpha-proton would show splitting. But the question says that the only anomaly is these two peaks for the alpha-proton. If the rest of the NMR is as expected, maybe it's more localized. For example, racemization at a single amino acid would result in diastereomers, which could affect multiple protons, but perhaps the primary noticeable effect in the NMR is on the alpha-proton. Whereas, cis-trans isomerism would affect the backbone conformation more, thus causing different shifts for protons adjacent to the peptide bond, such as the alpha-proton on the adjacent residue. So if a residue adjacent to proline has the alpha-proton split into two peaks, that might line up.

Alternatively, if the proline is at position n, then the peptide bond between n-1 and n can be cis or trans. The alpha-proton from residue n-1 would be close to that peptide bond. Cis vs trans could differentially shield or deshield that proton, leading to two separate peaks in NMR. And in LC-MS at high temp, you might still have separation. Hence, if the two isomers are present in equal amounts, they would split into two peaks in LC-MS with same mass. 

On the other hand, racemization leads to diastereomers. In diastereomers, more structural differences, so other protons might be affected, but the problem statement mentions only the alpha-proton shows two peaks, everything else is fine. But maybe the rest of the molecule is not affected because only a single stereocenter was inverted, and the rest are the same. For instance, if only one amino acid in the chain is racemized, perhaps the rest are the same, so only the alpha-proton from that residue is split. 

However, cis-trans isomerism could also just affect that specific alpha-proton. Maybe that's possible.

But given both options are possible, maybe the key is that the answer (as per typical exam questions) is cis-trans isomerism about a proline peptide bond. I recall that cis-trans isomerism in peptides with proline is a common issue leading to two peaks in HPLC with same mass, and split signals in NMR. Racemization is less likely if the synthesis conditions are standard, but it's possible. Unless the question specifies something else. But without more info, cis-trans is more commonly the cause.

So, putting it all together: two peaks in LC-MS same mass but different retention times, which can be explained by isomers. Two peaks in NMR for the same alpha-proton, same integral sum, no coupling. Since coupling is excluded, spin-spin isn't the cause. Therefore, the two species in solution, each contributing their own peaks. Since LC shows two species but same mass, it's either cis-trans isomerism or racemization (diastereomer). However, cis-trans around proline is a classic problem. Hence, the answer is the presence of cis and trans isomers of a proline peptide bond, which account for the two peaks in both NMR and LC-MS.
