# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet\_4 and Planet\_2, we start by using their orbital periods and applying Kepler's Third Law and the equilibrium temperature formula.

1. **Kepler's Third Law**: The orbital period \( P \) and semi-major axis \( a \) are related by \( P^2 \propto a^3 \). Thus, \( a \propto P^{2/3} \).

2. **Equilibrium Temperature**: The temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance (\( T \propto a^{-1/2} \)). Combining this with \( a \propto P^{2/3} \), we get \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \).

3. **Temperature Ratio**: For Planet\_4 and Planet\_2 with periods \( P_4 = 3.5 \) and \( P_2 = 2 \), the temperature ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{3.5} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}.
   \]

**Answer**:  
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet\_4 and Planet\_2 is \( \boxed{\sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{7}}} \).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let me try to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the distance from its star and the star's luminosity. Since they mentioned the planets have circular orbits and were discovered through the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But the key thing here is their orbital periods and the ratio given: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. They also said the albedo is the same, so we don't have to worry about differences in reflected light. 

First, equilibrium temperature formula. I recall the formula is something like T = T0 * (L / a²)^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the orbital distance, and T0 is some constant that includes factors like the albedo and the greenhouse effect. Since all the planets have the same albedo and assuming the same greenhouse effect (which isn't mentioned, so maybe we can ignore it), the ratio of their temperatures should depend only on their orbital distances.

But wait, wait. Orbital period comes into play via Kepler's third law. The period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed, so P² ∝ a³/(M), where M is the mass of the star. But since all the planets are orbiting the same star, M is constant. So P² ∝ a³. Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3). So the semi-major axis (orbital distance) is proportional to the orbital period to the power of 2/3. 

Therefore, substituting that into the equilibrium temperature formula. The temperature T is inversely proportional to a^(1/2) because the formula has a² in the denominator under L, so T ∝ (L / a²)^(1/4) means T ∝ L^(1/4) * a^(-1/2). If L is the same (because all planets are around the same star), then T ∝ a^(-1/2). But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then a^(-1/2) is proportional to P^(-1/3). Therefore, T ∝ P^(-1/3). 

So the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets would be the inverse of their orbital period ratio raised to the 1/3 power. So the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3). Given that the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, Planet_2 has a period of 2 units, Planet_4 has 3.5. Hence, P2/P4 is 2/3.5, which simplifies to 4/7. Then the temperature ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). 

Let me confirm. P ratios: Planet_2 = 2, Planet_4 = 3.5. So ratio (2 / 3.5) = 4/7. Then inverse of that for the orbital distance would be (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3). But since T is proportional to a^(-1/2), then a^(-1/2) is (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). Therefore, Temperature is indeed proportional to P^(-1/3). So, T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3) = (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). 

But is that the cube root of 4/7? Hmm, 4/7 is approximately 0.571, and the cube root of that is about 0.83. But the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4 over T2 is (2/3.5)^(1/3). Alternatively, if someone thought that period relates to distance via Kepler's law, then maybe  ( (P4 / P2 )^(2/3) ) which would be the ratio of semi-major axes, but since temperature is proportional to a^-1/2, then the temperature ratio is (a2/a4)^(1/2). Since (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3), then a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3), then (a2/a4)^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3), which matches what we had earlier. Yep, same result. 

So, answer is (2 / 3.5)^(1/3). Simplify 2/3.5. 3.5 is 7/2, so 2 / (7/2) = 4/7. So (4/7)^(1/3). To write as a ratio, they might want it in terms of cube roots. Alternatively rationalized, but cube roots are fine. Maybe writing as (4)^{1/3}/(7)^{1/3} which is ∛4 / ∛7. 

But just to check the steps another way. Let’s assume star mass M, then Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So a = [ (GM/4π²) P² ]^(1/3). But when taking ratios, the constants cancel. So for Planet_4 and Planet_2, a4/a2 = (P4² / P2²)^(1/3) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). So that is (3.5/2)^(2/3). Then the equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ (1 - A) L / (16πσ a²) ]^(1/4). Since A is the same and L is the same, T ∝ a^(-1/2), so T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). Which again gives us the same answer: (2/3.5)^(1/3). So, same as before. 

Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T4/T2 is the cube root of (2 divided by 3.5), which is cube root of (4/7). So ultimately, ∛(4/7), or 4^(1/3)/7^(1/3).

Alternatively, we can rationalize it as 2^(2/3)/7^(1/3), but it's probably best to leave it as the cube root of 4/7. So, as a ratio, Planet_4 to Planet_2 is ∛(4/7), but they ask for the ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Wait, no, the question says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2". That's T4/T2. Which is (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). So the answer is the cube root of (4/7).

Let me attempt to determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. I recall that a planet's equilibrium temperature is determined by its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The information states that these planets have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV (Transit Timing Variation) method. The critical information is their orbital periods, with the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planets 1 through 5. Since all planets have the same albedo, we don't need to account for differences in reflected light.

Initially, I should consider the equilibrium temperature formula: T = T0 * (L / a²)^(1/4), where L represents the star's luminosity, a is the orbital distance, and T0 is a constant incorporating factors like albedo and greenhouse effects. As all planets share the same albedo and assuming identical greenhouse effects (which isn't mentioned, so perhaps negligible), their temperature ratios should only depend on orbital distances.

However, I need to consider that orbital period relates to distance through Kepler's third law. The square of the period is proportional

Sure! Here's the rephrased text:

Let me attempt to determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. I recall that a planet's equilibrium temperature depends on its distance from its star and the luminosity of the star. It's mentioned that the planets have circular orbits and were detected using the TTV method, which stands for Transit Timing Variation. The crucial detail here is their orbital periods and the given ratio: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. Additionally, since they mentioned the albedo is the same for all, we can ignore any differences due to reflected light.

Now, regarding the equilibrium temperature formula. I remember it's something like T = T0 * (L / a²)^(1/4), where L represents the star's luminosity, a is the distance of the orbit, and T0 is a constant that encompasses variables like albedo and the greenhouse effect. Given that all planets have the same albedo and assuming an identical greenhouse effect (not mentioned, so perhaps we can disregard it), the temperatures' ratio should solely depend on their orbital distances.

However, hold on. The orbital period is also involved through Kepler's third law. The square of the period is proportional...

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by using the equilibrium temperature formula and Kepler's third law. 

1. **Equilibrium Temperature Formula**: The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is proportional to \( \frac{1}{a^{1/2}} \), where \( a \) is the orbital distance.
2. **Kepler's Third Law**: The orbital period \( P \) is related to the semi-major axis \( a \) by \( a \propto P^{2/3} \).

Combining these, we find \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between two planets is given by \( \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3} \).

Given the orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5, Planet_2 has a period \( P_2 = 2 \) and Planet_4 has a period \( P_4 = 3.5 \). The ratio of their periods is \( \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \).

Taking the cube root of this ratio gives the temperature ratio:
\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\sqrt[3]{\dfrac{4}{7}}}.

 to the semi-major axis cubed, right? So P² ∝ a³, which means a ∝ P^(2/3). If we can express the semi-major axis in terms of the period, then we can substitute that into the temperature formula.

Let me write down the key equations:

1. Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/GM) * a³ → a = (GM/(4π²))^(1/3) * P^(2/3) → So a ∝ P^(2/3)

2. Equilibrium temperature: T ∝ (L / a²)^(1/4) = L^(1/4) / a^(1/2)

So if we substitute a from Kepler's law into the temperature formula:

T ∝ L^(1/4) / (P^(2/3))^(1/2) = L^(1/4) / P^(1/3)

But since all the planets are orbiting the same star, L is constant, so T ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Therefore, the temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 would be (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Given the period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_2 has period P2 = 2 units and Planet_4 has P4 = 3.5 units. Therefore, the ratio is (2 / 3.5)^(1/3). 

Simplify 2/3.5. 3.5 is 7/2, so 2 / (7/2) = 4/7. Therefore, the temperature ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). 

But wait, cubed root of 4/7. Is there a way to express that more neatly? Since 4 is 2² and 7 is prime. So it's 2^(2/3)/7^(1/3). Maybe they just want the fractional exponent or the decimal? But in ratio, probably leave it as (4/7)^(1/3) or perhaps rationalizing? But unless there's more info, that should be the ratio. 

But wait, just making sure I didn't mix up anything. The temperature formula: T ∝ L^(1/4)/a^(1/2). Then with a ∝ P^(2/3), then a^(1/2) ∝ P^(1/3). So substituting, T ∝ L^(1/4) / P^(1/3). Since L is constant, it becomes T ∝ P^(-1/3), so T4 / T2 = (P4 / P2)^(-1/3) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). Exactly. So yes, (2/3.5)^(1/3) which is (4/7)^(1/3). 

Alternatively, simplified, (4/7)^(1/3) = (4)^(1/3)/(7)^(1/3) = 2^(2/3)/7^(1/3). Unless the question expects the ratio to be expressed in terms of exponents with the same base? But 4 and 7 don't share the same base. Alternatively, maybe approximate cube roots? Like 4^(1/3) ≈ 1.587 and 7^(1/3) ≈ 1.913, so the ratio is approximately 1.587 / 1.913 ≈ 0.83.

Then using Kepler's law, a ∝ P^(2/3), so substituting back in, T ∝ 1/(P^(2/3))^(1/2) = 1/P^(1/3). Same result. 

So I think my initial reasoning is correct. So the ratio is (P2 / P4)^(1/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). But maybe it's better to rationalize the fraction first.

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2. So 2 divided by 7/2 is 4/7. Yup. Alternatively, sometimes these ratios are presented as fractions involving cube roots. For example, \sqrt[3]{4/7}. 

Alternatively, maybe express the ratio between T4 and T2. Wait, note that (T4/T2) = ( (1/P4^{1/3}) / (1/P2^{1/3}) ) = (P2 / P4)^{1/3}. So T4/T2 = (2 / 3.5)^{1/3} = (4/7)^{1/3}. So they're asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So, it's T4 : T2 = (4/7)^{1/3} : 1, or written as the ratio (4/7)^{1/3}.

3. Period of Planet 4 is 3.5, period of Planet 2 is 2. So take the ratio (2/3.5) = 4/7, take the cube root, so temperature ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). 

Yes, everything seems consistent. So unless the problem requires further simplification or there's a mistake in my steps, this should be the answer.

Another point to consider: since they are in orbital resonance, does that affect their periods? Wait, the problem already gives the periods as in resonance with a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So perhaps the actual periods are in those ratios, but orbital resonances usually involve integer ratios. Wait, but 2.5 is 5/2, 3.5 is 7/2, hmm. Maybe 1:2:5/2:7/2:5, which can also be written as 2:4:5:7:10 if multiplied by 2? Not sure if that's important here. But the problem just gives the period ratio as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so take them as given.

So Planet_1: 1, Planet_2: 2, Planet_3: 2.5, Planet_4: 3.5, Planet_5: 5. So P4 = 3.5, P2 = 2, so their temperature ratio is (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). 

If needed to write this as a ratio with both numerator and denominator under cube roots, \sqrt[3]{4} / \sqrt[3]{7}. But since the question just asks for the ratio and to present it in a box, probably best to write \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}} or \boxed{\sqrt[3]{\dfrac{4}{7}}}.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\sqrt[3]{\dfrac{4}{7}}}.

The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the cube root of its orbital period when considering the same albedo and a common star. Given the orbital periods of Planet_4 (3.5) and Planet_2 (2) in the ratio provided, the temperature ratio is derived as follows:

1. **Kepler's Third Law**: The orbital distance \(a\) is proportional to \(P^{2/3}\).
2. **Equilibrium Temperature**: \(T \propto P^{-1/3}\).
3. **Temperature Ratio**: 
   \[
   \frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{3.5} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
   \]

The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \(\boxed{\sqrt[3]{\dfrac{4}{7}}}\).

 to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is the same as orbital distance for circular orbits). Thus, if P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, then (a1³) : (a2³) : (a3³) : (a4³) : (a5³) is proportional to (P1²) : (P2²) : (P3²) : (P4²) : (P5²). Hence, the ratio of a1 : a2 : a3 : a4 : a5 should be P1^(2/3) : P2^(2/3) : P3^(2/3) : P4^(2/3) : P5^(2/3).

Given that temperatures depend inversely on the square root of distance (since T is proportional to a^(-1/2)), the temperature ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2 would be (a2 / a4)^(1/2). But first, I need to find the actual distances from their periods. Let's compute the ratio. Let's denote Period_ratio = P4 / P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75. From Kepler's law, (a4/a2)³ = (P4/P2)² => (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Then temperature ratio T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = [1/(1.75)^(2/3)]^(1/2) }= (1.75)^(-1/3). Therefore, evaluating (1.75)^(1/3). Since 1.75 = 7/4, the cube root of (7/4) is approx 1.913 / 1.587 but exact value is 7^(1/3)/4^(1/3). The inverse would be (4/7)^(1/3). Therefore, temperature ratio is (4/7)^(1/3). However, maybe there's a step I missed.

Wait, let's check again: Starting from equilibrium temperature formula: T ∝ (L/a²)^(1/4). But if the star's luminosity (L) is the same for both planets, so they're orbiting the same star, then T ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4)= a^(-1/2). Hence, T is inversely proportional to the square root of a. From Kepler's third law, a³ ∝ P², so a ∝ P^(2/3). Substituting into T ∝ a^(-1/2) gives T ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). Therefore, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So for Planet_4 and Planet_2, their temperature ratio would be T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). Given P_2 = 2 and P_4 = 3.5 in units where P1=1. So T4/T2 = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3). This is the cube root of (4/7). But converting 4/7 into a reduced fraction gives 4/7, approximately 0.571, and cube root of that is approximately 0.83. However, the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Therefore, it's T4 / T2 = (2 / 7/2)^(1/3) = which is (4/7)^(1/3), Yes, same. Let's write it as (4/7)^(1/3) which is equivalent to cube_root(4/7). Alternatively maybe the answer is (2^2/(7))^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). To put as a ratio, it'll be \boxed{\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}} or \boxed{\sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{7}}}.

Therefore, that seems to be the case. But, maybe let's reverify to see if I made a mistake somewhere. If intervals are correct. When converting from Periods to semi-major axes through Kepler's law, and then link to equilibrium temperature. The correct conclusion is that T is proportional to P^(-1/3) since as period increases, temperature decreases. So T4/T2 is (P2/P4)^{1/3} = (2/3.5)^{1/3} = (4/7)^{1/3}. Makes sense.

The equilibrium temperature is calculated by T = [ L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a²) ]^{1/4}, where A is albedo (same here), σ is Stefan-boltzmann, L is stellar luminosity, a is the orbital radius. Hence, T ∝ ( L / a² )^{1/4}. But since Kepler's third law states that a³ = G M P²/(4 π²), with M being star's mass, so a ∝ (M)^{1/3} P^{2/3}. If all planets are orbiting the same star, M is constant, so a depends only on P^{2/3}. Therefore, substituting a in T formula, T ∝ ( L / ( P^(4/3) ) )^{1/4 } = L^{1/4} / P^{1/3}. If L is the same, then T ∝ P^{-1/3}

Therefore confirmed, in this case, ratio T4 / T2 = (P2 / P4)^{1/3} = (2 / 3.5)^{1/3} = (4/7)^{1/3}. 4 and 7, simplest terms. So expressed cube root(4/7). Just to be exact, since we need a ratio between T4 and T2, so T4:T2 is proportional to (4/7)^{1/3}:1.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting their orbital periods given in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Specifically, Planet_2 has a period of 2 and Planet_4 has a period of 3.5.

Using Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \( a \) (i.e., \( P^2 \propto a^3 \)), we can express the semi-major axis ratio as:
\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left( \frac{P_4}{P_2} \right)^{2/3}
\]
Substituting the given periods:
\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left( \frac{3.5}{2} \right)^{2/3} = \left( \frac{7}{4} \right)^{2/3}
\]

The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis (since \( T \propto a^{-1/2} \)). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{a_2}{a_4} \right)^{1/2}
\]

Substituting the semi-major axis ratio:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{2/3} \right)^{1/2} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:
\[
\boxed{\left(\dfrac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 wait, Kepler's third law states that P² is proportional to a³/(M_*), where M_* is the mass of the star. But since all planets orbit the same star, M_* is constant, so P² ∝ a³. Therefore, the orbital periods are related to their semi-major axes (which, in the case of circular orbits, is just the radius) by the relation a³ ∝ P², so a ∝ P^(2/3).

But the problem gives the orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So if I want to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, which have orbital periods in the ratio of 3.5:2. Because Planet_2's period is 2, Planet_4 is 3.5.

But let me confirm what the exact orbital period ratios are. The original ratio is listed as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 to Planet_5. Therefore, Planet_2 has a period of 2, and Planet_4 has 3.5. So first, their periods are 2 and 3.5. So using P² ∝ a³ → a = P^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5 / 2)^(2/3). Therefore, the semi-major axis ratio is (3.5/2)^(2/3). Since equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to a^(1/2), because T ∝ (L / a²)^(1/4) → since L is the same for each planet (they share the same star), so T ∝ (1/a²)^(1/4) = a^(-1/2). Hence, the temperature ratio T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) = ( (P2 / P4)^(2/3) )^(1/2 ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). Therefore, (2/3.5)^(1/3). Reducing that fraction, 2/3.5 is equal to 4/7. Therefore, the ratio T4 / T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). Wait, that seems interesting. Let me confirm again the steps.

Starting from the beginning:

Equilibrium temperature formula: T ∝ (L / a²)^(1/4). Since L's the same, T ∝ a^(-1/2). Thus, the ratio T4/T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2).

But the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period by Kepler's law: a³ ∝ P², so a ∝ P^(2/3). Therefore, a4 = P4^(2/3) and a2 = P2^(2/3), so a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). Then (a2/a4)^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). Therefore:

T4 / T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). Therefore, the ratio is (2/3.5)^(1/3). 2/3.5 simplifies to 4/7, so (4/7)^(1/3). To write the ratio, it's the cube root of (4/7), or (4/7)^(1/3). Expressing this as a ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 would be T4 : T2 = Planet_4 temp / Planet_2 temp = (4/7)^(1/3). Alternatively, perhaps 4^(1/3) : 7^(1/3), but usually, ratios are left in fractional form unless rationalized. Alternatively, people might express it as squared or other terms but in cube root. 

The key steps are:

1. Equate Kepler's law: a ∝ P^(2/3)

2. From equilibrium temperature, T ∝ a^(-1/2)

Thus, T ratio: (P2/P4)^(1/3). 

Therefore, with P2 = 2 and P4 = 3.5, their ratio (2/3.5) raised to the 1/3 power. Numerically, 3.5 is 7/2, so 2 divided by 7/2 is 4/7, so (4/7)^(1/3) is the ratio for T4/T2. Wait, T4 over T2 would be (2/3.5)^(1/3) → which indeed is (4/7)^(1/3), but since T4 is compared to T2, so Temperature of Planet_4 over Planet_2 is (T4)/(T2) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3) = approximately 0.66, but presented as the cube root of 4/7. That is, the answer is the cube root of (4/7). But to write this as a ratio, it would be \boxed{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}}.

But let me re-verify once again to ensure no miscalculations.

First, from Kepler's third law: (a1/a2)³ = (P1/P2)². So (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Therefore, moving from period to semi-major axis: a ∝ P^(2/3). Correct.

Then, equating equilibrium temperature which for a planet is T = \[ ( ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ) \]^(1/4). Since we assume that all have the same albedo (A) and same luminosity (L), so T ∝ (1/a² )^(1/4) = a^{-1/2}. Therefore, the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis, which gives the ratios of temperature between two planets as T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1). So T4 = k / sqrt(a4), T2 = k / sqrt(a2). Therefore, T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (P2 / P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3). Correct, so all steps hold here. Thus the conclusion is (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). So, the answer is the cube root of 4 over 7. Since the problem asks for the ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, inserting this into a box. Alternatively, perhaps preferring to rationalize or leave in terms of exponents as presented. The problem says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures"—so the temperature of Planet_4 over Planet_2, hence (4/7)^{1/3}. Hence, boxed. Probability, as requested.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\left(\dfrac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}}.
