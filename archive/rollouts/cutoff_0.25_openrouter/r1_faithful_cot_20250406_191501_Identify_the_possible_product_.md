The Cope rearrangement involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift in a 1,5-diene system. For the given compound, (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) on the nitrogen and the double bond in the norbornene framework form a conjugated 1,5-diene system. 

**Key steps in the rearrangement:**
1. The vinyl group's γ-carbon (C3') forms a new bond with C6 of the bicyclic system.
2. The original double bond (C5=C6) shifts to form a new double bond between C5 and the vinyl group's α-carbon (C2').
3. The nitrogen becomes part of a new imine double bond (N=C1) due to the rearrangement.

This results in a ring expansion from a bicyclo[2.2.1] to a bicyclo[3.2.1] system. The stereochemistry at positions 1 and 4 is retained, and the product is:

**Product:**  
(1R,5S)-3-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene  

**Rationale:**  
- The bicyclo[3.2.1]octene framework arises from incorporating the vinyl group into the bicyclic structure.  
- The new double bonds are positioned at N=C1 and C5=C2'.  
- The stereochemistry (1R,5S) is consistent with the retention of configuration during the pericyclic reaction.  

This product retains the azabicyclic structure with an expanded ring system due to the Cope rearrangement.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here where I need to figure out the product of a Cope rearrangement on (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the Cope rearrangement is. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. The reaction proceeds through a cyclic transition state, forming a new six-membered ring. The key here is that the molecule must have a 1,5-diene structure for the rearrangement to occur.

Now, looking at the given compound: (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize the structure. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene part means it's a norbornene derivative, right? The numbering is such that there are two carbons in one bridge, two in another, and one in the third bridge. The "2-aza" indicates that there's a nitrogen atom at position 2. The "2-vinyl" means there's a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to that nitrogen. Also, the "hept-5-ene" suggests there's a double bond at position 5. The stereochemistry at positions 1 and 4 are specified as S and R, respectively.

So, the structure is a norbornene system with a nitrogen at position 2, which has a vinyl substituent. Let me draw this mentally. The bicyclo system has the bridge structure: positions 1 and 4 are bridgehead carbons. The double bond is at position 5, which is part of the six-membered ring? Wait, no. The norbornene structure has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. The double bond is usually in the five-membered ring, but in this case, hept-5-ene would be... Let me confirm the numbering. In bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, the bridgehead carbons are 1 and 4. The bridges are between 1-2-3-4 (two carbons), 1-7-4 (two carbons), and 1-5-6-4 (one carbon each). Wait, maybe I should sketch this out step by step.

Starting with bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane: the structure is like a norbornane. The bridgeheads are carbons 1 and 4. The three bridges are:
1. 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 (two-membered bridge),
2. 1 to 7 to 4 (two-membered bridge),
3. 1 to 5 to 6 to 4 (one-membered bridge).

But in the given compound, it's hept-5-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6? That would be part of the six-membered ring? Wait, maybe not. Let me check the numbering again. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is in the two-membered bridge? No, that's not possible. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would have the double bond between positions 5 and 6. So, in the six-membered ring (the one that includes the bridge 1-5-6-4), the double bond is between 5 and 6. So that's part of the bicyclic system.

Now, the substituents: at position 2, there's a nitrogen (2-aza), so instead of a carbon at position 2, it's a nitrogen. And attached to that nitrogen is a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). So, the structure is a norbornene derivative with a nitrogen in the bridge and a vinyl group on that nitrogen. The stereochemistry at positions 1 and 4 is S and R, respectively. That might affect the transition state during the Cope rearrangement.

But wait, the Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-diene. Let me check if the molecule has that. The existing double bond is at position 5-6. The vinyl group is on the nitrogen at position 2. The vinyl group has its own double bond (CH₂=CH-). So, is there a conjugated diene or a 1,5-diene here?

Let me see. The vinyl group is on the nitrogen at position 2. The existing double bond is at position 5-6. The distance between these two double bonds—how many atoms apart are they? The nitrogen is at position 2. The bridgeheads are 1 and 4. So, position 2 is adjacent to bridgehead 1. Then position 5 is on the bridge from 1 to 5 to 6 to 4. So, the vinyl group's double bond (on N-2) and the 5-ene double bond—are they part of a 1,5-diene system?

Wait, the Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-diene, meaning two double bonds separated by a single bond, forming a conjugated diene? No, actually, a 1,5-diene in the context of Cope rearrangement is a system where the two ends of the diene are separated by three single bonds, allowing for a [3,3] shift. So, for example, if you have a structure like CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-, but arranged in a way that a [3,3] shift can occur.

But in this molecule, the vinyl group on the nitrogen and the existing double bond in the norbornene system—are these two double bonds part of a 1,5-diene system? Let me check the connectivity. The nitrogen is at position 2. The vinyl group is attached to N-2. The other double bond is between C5 and C6. Let me see the connectivity from the vinyl group's double bond to the C5-C6 double bond. Starting from the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-), the nitrogen is at position 2. The bridgehead is position 1 (S) connected to N-2. Position 1 is connected to C5 as part of the bridge. So, from the vinyl group's double bond (which is on N-2), moving through N-2 to C1, then to C5, and then the C5-C6 double bond. The path is: vinyl double bond (C2'-C3') -> N-2 -> C1 -> C5 -> C5=C6. So, between the two double bonds, there's a path of N-2, C1, C5. That's three atoms apart. Wait, but the Cope rearrangement needs a 1,5-diene, meaning the two ends are separated by three single bonds. Hmm. Maybe the nitrogen is part of the conjugated system?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't set up for a Cope rearrangement. But the question says it does undergo Cope rearrangement, so maybe I need to reconsider the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group and the existing double bond form a 1,5-diene through the bicyclic framework. Let me try to map the positions. Let's imagine the nitrogen at position 2 has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). The nitrogen is connected to C1 and C3 (since it's in position 2 of the bicyclo structure). The double bond in the ring is between C5 and C6. The bridge from C1 goes to C5, then to C6, then to C4. So, the distance from the vinyl group's double bond (let's say the vinyl is C2'=C3') to the ring double bond (C5=C6): starting at C3', connected to N-2, which is connected to C1, which is connected to C5, which is double-bonded to C6. So, the two double bonds are separated by three single bonds: C3'-N-C1-C5=C6. That is a 1,5-diene? Because there are three single bonds between the two double bonds. So, the vinyl group's double bond is at one end, and the ring double bond is at the other end, with three single bonds in between. So that forms a 1,5-diene system. Therefore, this molecule should be able to undergo Cope rearrangement.

So the Cope rearrangement would involve a [3,3] shift, moving the sigma bond between N-2 and C1 to between C3' and N-2, or something like that. Wait, let me think. The 1,5-diene is C3'=C2'-N-C1-C5=C6. Wait, maybe the actual 1,5-diene is the vinyl group (C2'=C3') connected through N-2, then through C1, C5, to C6. So the positions are C3', C2', N, C1, C5, C6. The two double bonds are at C3'-C2' and C5-C6. That's a 1,5-diene with three single bonds in between. So during Cope rearrangement, the [3,3] shift would form a new double bond between N and C1, and between C5 and C2', perhaps? Hmm, not sure. Let me consider the general mechanism.

In a typical Cope rearrangement, the 1,5-diene (let's say a structure like A-B-C-D-E-F, where A-B is a double bond and E-F is another double bond, with three single bonds in between) would rearrange such that the double bonds shift to B-C and D-E, forming a new six-membered ring transition state. The result is a new structure where the former single bonds become double bonds, and vice versa.

In this case, the vinyl group (C2'=C3') is connected to N-2, which is connected to C1, which is connected to C5, which is double-bonded to C6. So the 1,5-diene is C3'=C2'-N-C1-C5=C6. The Cope rearrangement would form a new double bond between N and C1, and between C5 and C2', while breaking the original double bonds. Wait, but how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group's double bond and the ring's double bond are conjugated through the nitrogen. But nitrogen is not a carbon, so conjugation might be different. Hmm. Wait, but maybe the lone pair on nitrogen can participate in some resonance. Let me think. If there's a vinyl group attached to nitrogen, perhaps the double bond can conjugate with the nitrogen's lone pair, creating some partial double bond character between N and adjacent carbons. But in this case, the nitrogen is part of a bicyclic system, so its geometry might restrict resonance.

Alternatively, maybe the Cope rearrangement here would form a new six-membered ring involving the nitrogen. Let me try to imagine the transition state. The [3,3] shift would involve the movement of the vinyl group's gamma carbon (C3') to form a new bond with C6, while the C5 would form a bond with C2'? Wait, maybe not. Let me consider numbering the atoms involved in the 1,5-diene.

If we number the 1,5-diene as positions 1 through 6, where 1-2 is the vinyl double bond (C3'=C2'), then position 3 is the nitrogen (N-2), position 4 is C1, position 5 is C5, and position 6 is the double bond C5=C6. Wait, this might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the 1,5-diene is considered as the conjugated system through the atoms: C3' (1), C2' (2), N (3), C1 (4), C5 (5), C6 (6). So positions 1-2 (C3'=C2'), and positions 5-6 (C5=C6), with three single bonds in between (N-C1-C5). Then the Cope rearrangement would form new bonds between C3' and C6, and between C2' and C5, resulting in new double bonds between C2'-C5 and C3'-C6. But how does that translate into the bicyclic structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the rearrangement leads to a new bicyclic structure. Let's try to follow the movement. The original structure is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. After Cope rearrangement, the vinyl group's former gamma carbon (C3') would become bonded to C6, and C5 would bond to C2'. This would break the original double bonds (C3'=C2' and C5=C6), forming new double bonds between N and C1, and between C2' and C5. Wait, but how does the bicyclic system adjust?

Alternatively, maybe the bridge structure changes. Let me think: the original bridges are between 1-2-3-4, 1-7-4, and 1-5-6-4. After rearrangement, if the vinyl group's carbons (C2' and C3') become part of a new bridge. Let me try to imagine. Suppose during the Cope rearrangement, the bond between C3' and C2' (the vinyl double bond) breaks, and new bonds form between C3' and C6, and between C2' and C5. This would create a new six-membered ring. But the original bicyclic structure is already a bridged system, so adding a new bridge might complicate things.

Wait, maybe after the Cope rearrangement, the nitrogen becomes part of a different bridge. Let me try to map the possible connections. If the vinyl group (C2'=C3') undergoes [3,3] shift, then the C3' would connect to C6, and C2' would connect to C5. The original bonds between N-2 and C2' (from the vinyl group) would break, as well as the double bonds. But wait, the vinyl group is attached to N-2. So the original structure has N-2 connected to C2' (from the vinyl group), and also to C1 and C3 in the bicyclic system. If the Cope rearrangement occurs, the sigma bond between N-2 and C2' would shift? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cope rearrangement in this case leads to the formation of a new bicyclic compound where the nitrogen is in a different position. For example, if the vinyl group's double bond (C2'=C3') and the ring double bond (C5=C6) are part of the 1,5-diene system, then after rearrangement, the new double bonds would be between N and C1, and between C3' and C6. But how does that affect the bicyclic structure?

Wait, maybe I need to consider the transition state. In the transition state of the Cope rearrangement, the six-membered ring is formed with partial bonds. The original bonds break as the new bonds form. So, the vinyl group's C3' would form a bond with C6, and the C5 would form a bond with C2'. This would create a new six-membered ring, which might alter the bicyclic structure.

Let me attempt to draw this. The original bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has a bridge from C1 to C5 to C6 to C4. If C5 forms a bond with C2' (from the vinyl group), and C3' (from the vinyl group) forms a bond with C6, then the new structure would have a bridge connecting C2' to C5 and C3' to C6. But the original bridges would still be present? This might create a new bicyclic system.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridges reorganize. Let's see. The original bridges are:
1. C1-C2-C3-C4 (with N at C2),
2. C1-C7-C4,
3. C1-C5-C6-C4.

After rearrangement, if C5 is bonded to C2' and C6 is bonded to C3', then the bridge from C1-C5-C6-C4 would be replaced with a bridge from C5-C2'-N-2-C3'-C6? Not sure. This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need to consider the stereochemistry as well. The original stereochemistry at C1 (S) and C4 (R) might influence the transition state and the final product's stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene derivative? Because the Cope rearrangement can increase the ring size. The original bicyclo[2.2.1] system could become bicyclo[2.2.2], which is a larger ring system. Let me check. The original molecule has a bicyclo[2.2.1] system, which has two bridges of two carbons each and one bridge of one carbon. If the Cope rearrangement adds a carbon to one of the bridges, it might become bicyclo[2.2.2]. For example, if the vinyl group's carbons become part of a bridge.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 8-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene or something like that. But I need to be more precise.

Wait, let me consider the number of atoms. The original compound is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, so seven-membered ring. After Cope rearrangement, if two new bonds are formed (C5-C2' and C6-C3'), but since the vinyl group was already part of the substituent, maybe the ring size increases. Wait, no, the total number of atoms should remain the same. The Cope rearrangement is a pericyclic reaction, so it doesn't add or remove atoms, just rearranges them.

Wait, the vinyl group is a substituent on the nitrogen. So the original molecule has seven carbons in the bicyclic system plus the two carbons from the vinyl group. But in the Cope rearrangement, the vinyl group's carbons would become part of the new bicyclic system. So, after rearrangement, the bicyclic system might incorporate those two carbons, leading to a nine-membered ring? No, that seems unlikely. Wait, maybe the original seven-membered bicyclic system (hept-) plus the two carbons from the vinyl group, but rearranged into a different bicyclic structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group's carbons (C2' and C3') are part of the 1,5-diene system, and during the Cope rearrangement, they move into the bicyclic framework. So the new bicyclic system would have those two carbons integrated. Let's try to imagine this.

Original structure: N-2 is connected to C1, C3, and the vinyl group (C2'). The vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, so C2' is connected to N and to C3' (which is CH₂). The Cope rearrangement would involve the [3,3] shift, moving the bond from C2'-C3' to form new bonds between C3' and C6, and between C5 and C2'. So, the new bonds would be C3'-C6 and C5-C2'. This would break the original double bonds (C2'=C3' and C5=C6), forming new double bonds between N-C1 and C2'-C5 (or maybe other positions).

Wait, but if C5 forms a bond with C2', and C6 forms a bond with C3', then the bicyclic system would now include C2' and C3'. So the bridges might now be between C1, C5, C2', N, etc. This is getting quite complex. Let me try to outline the possible connectivity.

After rearrangement:
- C3' is bonded to C6.
- C5 is bonded to C2'.
- The original bonds between C5 and C6 (double bond) become single bonds.
- The original double bond in the vinyl group (C2'=C3') becomes a single bond.

But how does this affect the bridges? The original bridge from C1 to C5 to C6 to C4 would now have C5 connected to C2', and C6 connected to C3'. So perhaps a new bridge is formed from C5 to C2' to N to C3' to C6 to C4? That might create a larger bridge. Alternatively, the original bridge C1-C5-C6-C4 is modified to include C2' and C3', making a longer bridge.

Alternatively, maybe the new structure becomes bicyclo[3.2.1]octene or something else. Let me count the atoms. The original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene has 7 atoms. If two more carbons from the vinyl group are incorporated into the bicyclic system, that would make 9 atoms, but that's not possible. Wait, no—the vinyl group is already part of the substituent, so maybe the rearrangement doesn't add carbons but repositions them.

Wait, maybe the vinyl group is considered part of the main chain for the purpose of the Cope rearrangement. Since the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] shift, the two ends (the former double bonds) become single bonds, and the central single bonds become double bonds. So the vinyl group's double bond (C2'=C3') and the ring double bond (C5=C6) would become single bonds, and the bonds between N and C1, and between C5 and C2' would become double bonds. Wait, but how does that integrate into the bicyclic system?

If the bond between N and C1 becomes a double bond, that would make the nitrogen part of a double bond, which would require rehybridization from sp³ to sp². But nitrogen can have double bonds, as in amines versus imines. So, maybe the product is an imine.

Alternatively, let's consider the possible product as a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene derivative, where the vinyl group has been incorporated into the ring system. The original bicyclo[2.2.1] becomes bicyclo[2.2.2] due to the addition of one more carbon in a bridge. But how?

Wait, the original bridges are two carbons (C1-C2-C3-C4), two carbons (C1-C7-C4), and one carbon (C1-C5-C6-C4). If the Cope rearrangement adds a carbon to the one-carbon bridge, making it two carbons, then the bridge system would be 2.2.2. For example, if the bridge from C1 to C5 to C6 to C4 becomes C1 to C5 to C2' to C3' to C6 to C4, that adds two carbons (C2' and C3') into the bridge, making it a longer bridge. But then the bridge would be five members, which might not fit the bicyclo notation.

Alternatively, maybe the new bridge is between C5 and C2', forming a new two-carbon bridge, and another bridge between C6 and C3', making another two-carbon bridge. So the bicyclo system would have three bridges: original two-carbon, another two-carbon, and maybe a three-carbon bridge. This is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for similar examples or think about the stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ring-expanded compound where the nitrogen is now in a different position. For instance, moving the vinyl group into the ring might create a larger ring. If the vinyl group's carbons (C2' and C3') become part of the ring, the seven-membered ring could become an eight-membered ring, but bicyclo systems are typically smaller.

Wait, another approach: the Cope rearrangement of a 1,5-diene typically gives a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl or similar. But in this case, with a nitrogen involved, maybe the product is an imine or an enamine. Alternatively, since the starting material is a bicyclic compound with a nitrogen, the product might retain the bicyclic structure but with different substituents or bridge positions.

Alternatively, maybe the product is (1S,4R)-3-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, but that seems like just a positional isomer, which might not account for the Cope rearrangement's [3,3] shift.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group moves from the nitrogen to another position in the ring. For example, if the [3,3] shift moves the vinyl group from N-2 to C3. But how? The Cope rearrangement usually shifts the substituents along the conjugated diene. In this case, the conjugated diene includes the vinyl group and the ring double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrogen acts as one of the central atoms in the 1,5-diene. Let me number the 1,5-diene as follows: positions 1 (C3'), 2 (C2'), 3 (N), 4 (C1), 5 (C5), 6 (C6). The double bonds are between 1-2 (C3'=C2') and 5-6 (C5=C6). The Cope rearrangement would form new double bonds between 2-3 (C2'-N) and 4-5 (C1-C5), with new sigma bonds between 1-6 (C3'-C6) and 3-4 (N-C1). Wait, but N is already connected to C1. If a new bond forms between N and C1, that would just be a double bond, perhaps. Wait, but the original bond between N and C1 is a single bond. If the Cope rearrangement forms a double bond there, that would make an imine.

So, the product would have a double bond between N and C1, and between C5 and C6 is gone, replaced by a single bond, and a new double bond between C2' and C5? Or between C3' and C6?

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline the possible changes step by step.

Original structure:
- N at position 2, connected to C1, C3, and the vinyl group (C2').
- Vinyl group: C2'=C3'.
- Ring double bond: C5=C6.

After Cope rearrangement:
- The [3,3] shift would form new bonds between C3' and C6, and between C5 and C2'.
- The original double bonds (C2'=C3' and C5=C6) become single bonds.
- New double bonds form between N and C1, and between C2' and C5? Or maybe between C3' and C6?

If new double bonds form where the original single bonds were, then between N and C1 (formerly single) becomes double, and between C2' and C5 (formerly single) becomes double. So the new structure would have a double bond between N and C1 (making an imine) and a double bond between C2' and C5. The bridges would adjust accordingly.

So, the nitrogen now has a double bond to C1, making it an imine. The vinyl group's C2' is now bonded to C5, and C3' is bonded to C6. This would create a new bridge between C5 and C2', and between C6 and C3'. The original bridge from C1 to C5 to C6 to C4 would now go from C1 (double-bonded to N) to C5 (bonded to C2'), then to C2', which is part of the vinyl group now connected to C5. C3' is connected to C6 and to N (through the original vinyl group). Wait, but this might form a new bridge.

Alternatively, the new bonds (C3'-C6 and C5-C2') would create a six-membered ring including N, C1, C5, C2', C3', and C6. But the original bicyclic structure would still have the other bridges. This might result in a tricyclic compound or a different bicyclic system.

Alternatively, the product could be a 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene, where one of the bridges has been extended by the vinyl group's carbons. The bicyclo[3.2.1] system has bridges of three, two, and one carbons. This would require incorporating the vinyl group's carbons into one of the bridges.

Given that the original compound has seven atoms in the bicyclic system (hept), adding the two carbons from the vinyl group would make nine, but since the Cope rearrangement is a sigmatropic shift, the number of atoms remains the same; it's just the connectivity that changes. Therefore, the product should also be a seven-membered bicyclic compound but with different bridge connections.

Wait, but the vinyl group is a substituent, not part of the original bicyclic system. So maybe the product incorporates the vinyl group into the bicyclic framework, making a larger bicyclic system. For example, if the vinyl group's carbons become part of a bridge, the bicyclo system might go from [2.2.1] to [3.2.1], which is an eight-membered ring (oct), but the original compound is a heptene. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene with the vinyl group moved to a different position. But how? The Cope rearrangement isn't just moving substituents but rearranging the carbon skeleton.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the Cope rearrangement will form a new six-membered ring in the transition state, which then relaxes into a new bicyclic structure. For example, the original bicyclo[2.2.1] system might rearrange into a bicyclo[3.1.1] system or similar.

Alternatively, considering the stereochemistry, the product might have new stereocenters or retain the existing ones. The original stereochemistry at C1 (S) and C4 (R) might influence the transition state's chair-like or boat-like conformation, affecting the product's structure.

Another angle: the Cope rearrangement can sometimes lead to ring expansion or contraction. In this case, with the vinyl group attached to nitrogen in a bicyclic system, the rearrangement might break one bridge and form another, altering the bicyclo structure.

Alternatively, if I look for similar examples, the Cope rearrangement of norbornene derivatives with appropriate substituents can lead to ring-expanded products. For instance, a vinyl group attached to a bridgehead might lead to a bicyclo[3.2.1] system after rearrangement.

Wait, here's a thought. The original compound is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. After Cope rearrangement, the vinyl group's gamma carbon (C3') forms a bond with C6, and the C5 forms a bond with C2'. This would create a new bridge between C5 and C2', and between C6 and C3'. The original bridge from C1 to C5 to C6 to C4 would now have a new connection. The nitrogen, now connected to C1 via a double bond (imine), and the new bonds C5-C2' and C6-C3' would create a new bicyclo system.

If C5 is now bonded to C2', and C6 is bonded to C3', then the bridge lengths would change. The original bridge C1-C5-C6-C4 (length 3: C1 to C5 is one bond, C5 to C6 was a double bond, now single, and C6 to C4 is another bond) would be modified. The new bonds C5-C2' and C6-C3' would create a bridge from C5 to C2' to N to C3' to C6. That might form a bridge of four carbons (C5-C2'-N-C3'-C6), but that seems too long. Alternatively, maybe it forms two new bridges: one between C5 and C2', and another between C6 and C3', while the original bridges remain.

This is really complex. Maybe I should look for the most probable product. Given the starting material is a 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, after Cope rearrangement, the product would likely be a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene derivative, where the vinyl group has been incorporated into a new bridge, expanding the bicyclo system from [2.2.1] to [2.2.2]. The octene system would have eight members, but the original was heptene. Hmm, but the number of carbons would increase by one, which contradicts the Cope rearrangement's nature as a sigmatropic shift (same number of atoms).

Wait, the vinyl group has two carbons. If those are incorporated into the ring, the original seven-membered bicyclo becomes nine-membered, which is unlikely. But maybe not; the original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has seven carbons. The vinyl group is a substituent, so maybe during the Cope rearrangement, those two carbons become part of the bicyclic system, making it bicyclo[3.2.1]octane (eight carbons). But where would the extra carbon come from? The original compound is heptene (seven carbons), plus the two from the vinyl group makes nine, but that can't be.

Wait, no. The starting material is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. The "2-vinyl" means the vinyl group is attached to the nitrogen at position 2. The bicyclo system itself has seven carbons (hept), with one replaced by nitrogen (aza). So total atoms in the ring: six carbons + one nitrogen. The vinyl group is a substituent (two carbons). So in total, the molecule has six carbons in the bicyclo system, one nitrogen, and two more carbons in the vinyl group. During Cope rearrangement, those two carbons from the vinyl group become part of the ring, making the new bicyclo system have eight members (six original carbons + two from vinyl), but the nitrogen is still there. So it would be a bicyclo[2.2.2]octene system? That would make sense. Let me check.

Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has three bridges, each with two carbons. If the original bridges were [2.2.1], adding one more carbon to the third bridge (from 1 to 5 to 6 to 4) by incorporating the vinyl group's carbons would make it [2.2.2]. So the product would be 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene or similar.

But how exactly? If the vinyl group's carbons (C2' and C3') form a new bridge between C5 and C6, then the bridge from C1 to C5 to C2' to C3' to C6 to C4 would make it a two-carbon bridge (C5-C2'-C3'-C6), but that's four carbons. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, maybe the new bridge is between C5 and C2' (one carbon) and between C6 and C3' (one carbon), making the third bridge two carbons, hence bicyclo[2.2.2].

Alternatively, after the Cope rearrangement, the bridges are:
1. C1-C2-C3-C4 (two carbons),
2. C1-C7-C4 (two carbons),
3. C1-C5-C2'-C3'-C6-C4 (three carbons? No, this doesn't fit).

Wait, maybe the correct product is 3-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene. But I need to ensure the bridge counts. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has three bridges, each of two carbons. If the original [2.2.1] system had bridges of 2, 2, and 1 carbons, adding one carbon to the third bridge via the Cope rearrangement would make it 2, 2, 2, hence [2.2.2].

So, the product would be 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene with a vinyl group appropriately placed. However, the vinyl group would have been incorporated into the bridge during the rearrangement. Alternatively, the product might not have a vinyl group anymore, as it's part of the new bicyclic system.

Given all this, I think the most plausible product is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene derivative, where the former vinyl group has become part of the bicyclic framework through the Cope rearrangement. The exact structure would have the nitrogen in a different bridge, and the double bond position might shift.

But to confirm, let me look for an example. The Cope rearrangement of a norbornene derivative with a vinyl group can lead to a cubane-like structure or a different bicyclic system. Alternatively, in the case of 2-vinylnorbornene, the Cope rearrangement would form a bicyclo[3.2.1]octene. But with the nitrogen present, it might be similar.

Wait, another approach: the Cope rearrangement of 1,2-divinylnorbornene leads to a bicyclo[3.2.1]octadiene. Similarly, in this case, with a vinyl group attached to nitrogen, the product might be a 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octene. But I need to ensure the numbering.

Alternatively, considering the transition state, the ends of the 1,5-diene (vinyl and ring double bond) would form new sigma bonds, leading to a new bicyclic system. The exact structure would depend on which atoms form the new bonds.

Given all this, I think the product is likely to be (1R,5S)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the nitrogen might end up in a different position. Alternatively, the double bond could be in a different location.

Wait, considering the stereochemistry: the original compound has (1S,4R) configuration. After rearrangement, the new bridge formation would depend on the transition state's chair or boat conformation, which might retain some stereochemistry. But predicting the exact stereochemistry is tricky without a model.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is 3-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene, but I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll go with the most plausible structure based on Cope rearrangement leading to ring expansion from [2.2.1] to [2.2.2]. Therefore, the product is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene, with possible vinyl group positioning. However, since the vinyl group is consumed in the rearrangement, the product might not have a vinyl substituent but instead have an extended ring system.

Wait, no, in the Cope rearrangement, the vinyl group's carbons are part of the 1,5-diene and become integrated into the new structure. Therefore, the product should have those carbons in the ring. Hence, the correct product is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene. But I need to check the numbering again. Alternatively, maybe the double bond moves to a different position.

Alternatively, the product could be 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-5-ene. Comparing the two, bicyclo[2.2.2] has three two-carbon bridges, while [3.2.1] has bridges of three, two, and one carbons. Given the original [2.2.1] system, adding a carbon to one bridge would make it [3.2.1]. Therefore, the product is more likely bicyclo[3.2.1]octene.

But how? If the Cope rearrangement adds a carbon to the bridge, changing it from one to two carbons, but that might not fit. Alternatively, the vinyl group's two carbons extend a bridge from one to three carbons. Wait, this is getting too ambiguous without a visual.

Alternatively, consider that the Cope rearrangement of 2-vinylnorbornene (without the nitrogen) yields bicyclo[3.2.1]octene. If that's the case, then with the nitrogen present, the product would be 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octene. Therefore, the answer is likely 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-5-ene or similar.

But I need to confirm the position of the double bond. The original double bond was at position 5 in the heptene; after rearrangement, the double bond might shift. In the typical Cope rearrangement, the double bonds move to the adjacent positions. So if the original double bonds were at 1-2 and 5-6 (in the 1,5-diene numbering), after rearrangement, the new double bonds would be at 2-3 and 4-5. Translating this into the bicyclic system, the new double bond might be between different carbons.

Given the uncertainty, I think the most reasonable answer, considering the Cope rearrangement of a norbornene derivative with a vinyl group leading to a bicyclo[3.2.1] system, the product would be 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-5-ene. However, I'm not 100% sure. The presence of nitrogen might affect the outcome, but following the general trend, ring expansion from [2.2.1] to [3.2.1] is plausible.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here where I need to figure out the product of a Cope rearrangement on (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the Cope rearrangement is. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. The reaction proceeds through a cyclic transition state, forming a new six-membered ring. The key here is that the molecule must have a 1,5-diene structure for the rearrangement to occur.

Now, looking at the given compound: (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize the structure. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene part means it's a norbornene derivative, right? The numbering is such that there are two carbons in one bridge, two in another, and one in the third bridge. The "2-aza" indicates that there's a nitrogen atom at position 2. The "2-vinyl" means there's a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to that nitrogen. Also, the "hept-5-ene" suggests there's a double bond at position 5. The stereochemistry at positions 1 and 4 are specified as S and R, respectively.

So, the structure is a norbornene system with a nitrogen at position 2, which has a vinyl substituent. Let me draw this mentally. The bicyclo system has the bridge structure: positions 1 and 4 are bridgehead carbons. The double bond is at position 5, which is part of the six-membered ring? Wait, no. The norbornene structure has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. The double bond is usually in the five-membered ring, but in this case, hept-5-ene would be... Let me confirm the numbering. In bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, the bridgehead carbons are 1 and 4. The bridges are between 1-2-3-4 (two carbons), 1-7-4 (two carbons), and 1-5-6-4 (one carbon each). Wait, maybe I should sketch this out step by step.

Starting with bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane: the structure is like a norbornane. The bridgeheads are carbons 1 and 4. The three bridges are:
1. 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 (two-membered bridge),
2. 1 to 7 to 4 (two-membered bridge),
3. 1 to 5 to 6 to 4 (one-membered bridge).

But in the given compound, it's hept-5-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6? That would be part of the six-membered ring? Wait, maybe not. Let me check the numbering again. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is in the two-membered bridge? No, that's not possible. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would have the double bond between positions 5 and 6. So, in the six-membered ring (the one that includes the bridge 1-5-6-4), the double bond is between 5 and 6. So that's part of the bicyclic system.

Now, the substituents: at position 2, there's a nitrogen (2-aza), so instead of a carbon at position 2, it's a nitrogen. And attached to that nitrogen is a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). So, the structure is a norbornene derivative with a nitrogen in the bridge and a vinyl group on that nitrogen. The stereochemistry at positions 1 and 4 is S and R, respectively. That might affect the transition state during the Cope rearrangement.

But wait, the Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-diene. Let me check if the molecule has that. The existing double bond is at position 5-6. The vinyl group is on the nitrogen at position 2. The vinyl group has its own double bond (CH₂=CH-). So, is there a conjugated diene or a 1,5-diene here?

Let me see. The vinyl group is on the nitrogen at position 2. The existing double bond is at position 5-6. The distance between these two double bonds—how many atoms apart are they? The nitrogen is at position 2. The bridgeheads are 1 and 4. So, position 2 is adjacent to bridgehead 1. Then position 5 is on the bridge from 1 to 5 to 6 to 4. So, the vinyl group's double bond (on N-2) and the 5-ene double bond—are they part of a 1,5-diene system?

Wait, the Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-diene, meaning two double bonds separated by a single bond, forming a conjugated diene? No, actually, a 1,5-diene in the context of Cope rearrangement is a system where the two ends of the diene are separated by three single bonds, allowing for a [3,3] shift. So, for example, if you have a structure like CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-, but arranged in a way that a [3,3] shift can occur.

But in this molecule, the vinyl group on the nitrogen and the existing double bond in the norbornene system—are these two double bonds part of a 1,5-diene system? Let me check the connectivity. The nitrogen is at position 2. The vinyl group is attached to N-2. The other double bond is between C5 and C6. Let me see the connectivity from the vinyl group's double bond to the C5-C6 double bond. Starting from the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-), the nitrogen is at position 2. The bridgehead is position 1 (S) connected to N-2. Position 1 is connected to C5 as part of the bridge. So, from the vinyl group's double bond (which is on N-2), moving through N-2 to C1, then to C5, and then the C5-C6 double bond. The path is: vinyl double bond (C2'-C3') -> N-2 -> C1 -> C5 -> C5=C6. So, between the two double bonds, there's a path of N-2, C1, C5. That's three atoms apart. Wait, but the Cope rearrangement needs a 1,5-diene, meaning the two ends are separated by three single bonds. Hmm. Maybe the nitrogen is part of the conjugated system?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't set up for a Cope rearrangement. But the question says it does undergo Cope rearrangement, so maybe I need to reconsider the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group and the existing double bond form a 1,5-diene through the bicyclic framework. Let me try to map the positions. Let's imagine the nitrogen at position 2 has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). The nitrogen is connected to C1 and C3 (since it's in position 2 of the bicyclo structure). The double bond in the ring is between C5 and C6. The bridge from C1 goes to C5, then to C6, then to C4. So, the distance from the vinyl group's double bond (let's say the vinyl is C2'=C3') to the ring double bond (C5=C6): starting at C3', connected to N-2, which is connected to C1, which is connected to C5, which is double-bonded to C6. So, the two double bonds are separated by three single bonds: C3'-N-C1-C5=C6. That is a 1,5-diene? Because there are three single bonds between the two double bonds. So, the vinyl group's double bond is at one end, and the ring double bond is at the other end, with three single bonds in between. So that forms a 1,5-diene system. Therefore, this molecule should be able to undergo Cope rearrangement.

So the Cope rearrangement would involve a [3,3] shift, moving the sigma bond between N-2 and C1 to between C3' and N-2, or something like that. Wait, let me think. The 1,5-diene is C3'=C2'-N-C1-C5=C6. Wait, maybe the actual 1,5-diene is the vinyl group (C2'=C3') connected through N-2, then through C1, C5, to C6. So the positions are C3', C2', N, C1, C5, C6. The two double bonds are at C3'-C2' and C5-C6. That's a 1,5-diene with three single bonds in between. So during Cope rearrangement, the [3,3] shift would form a new double bond between N and C1, and between C5 and C2', perhaps? Hmm, not sure. Let me consider the general mechanism.

In a typical Cope rearrangement, the 1,5-diene (let's say a structure like A-B-C-D-E-F, where A-B is a double bond and E-F is another double bond, with three single bonds in between) would rearrange such that the double bonds shift to B-C and D-E, forming a new six-membered ring transition state. The result is a new structure where the former single bonds become double bonds, and vice versa.

In this case, the vinyl group (C2'=C3') is connected to N-2, which is connected to C1, which is connected to C5, which is double-bonded to C6. So the 1,5-diene is C3'=C2'-N-C1-C5=C6. The Cope rearrangement would form a new double bond between N and C1, and between C5 and C2', while breaking the original double bonds. Wait, but how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group's double bond and the ring's double bond are conjugated through the nitrogen. But nitrogen is not a carbon, so conjugation might be different. Hmm. Wait, but maybe the lone pair on nitrogen can participate in some resonance. Let me think. If there's a vinyl group attached to nitrogen, perhaps the double bond can conjugate with the nitrogen's lone pair, creating some partial double bond character between N and adjacent carbons. But in this case, the nitrogen is part of a bicyclic system, so its geometry might restric

Alright, let me consider this organic chemistry problem involving the Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. To begin, I should recall that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes, proceeding through a cyclic transition state to form a new six-membered ring. The crucial requirement for this rearrangement is the presence of a 1,5-diene structure within the molecule.

Now, let me examine the given compound: (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. This structure is a norbornene derivative, as indicated by the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene portion. The numbering suggests two carbons in one bridge, two in another, and one in the third bridge. The presence of "2-aza" denotes a nitrogen atom at position 2, while "2-vinyl" signifies a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to that nitrogen. Furthermore, "hept-5-ene" implies a double bond at position 5. The stereochemistry at positions 1 and 4 is specified as S and R, respectively.

To better understand the structure, I should mentally visualize it step by step. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system has bridgehead carbons at positions 1 and 4, with three bridges connecting them: 1-2-3-4 (two carbons), 1-7-4 (two carbons), and 1-5-6-4 (one carbon each). In the given compound, the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6, which is part of the six-membered ring (1-5-6-4 bridge).

Regarding the substituents, a nitrogen atom replaces the carbon at position 2 (2-aza), and a vinyl group is attached to this nitrogen. The stereochemistry at positions 1 and 4 (S and R, respectively) might influence the transition state during the Cope rearrangement.

To determine if the molecule can undergo a Cope rearrangement, I must check for the presence of a 1,5-diene system. The vinyl group on the nitrogen and the existing double bond in the norbornene system might form a 1,5-diene through the bicyclic framework. Mapping the positions, the vinyl group (C2'=C3') is connected to N-2, which is connected to C1, which is connected to C5, which is double-bonded to C6. Thus, the two double bonds are separated by three single bonds: C3'-N-C1-C5=C6, forming a 1,5-diene system.

The Cope rearrangement would involve a [3,3] shift, moving the sigma bond between N-2 and C1 to between C3' and N-2, or something similar. The 1,5-diene can be represented as C3'=C2'-N-C1-C5=C6, with the two double bonds at C3'-C2' and C5-C6. During the Cope rearrangement, the [3,3] shift would form a new double bond between N and C1, and between C5 and C2'.

In a typical Cope rearrangement, the 1,5-diene (A-B-C-D-E-F, where A-B and E-F are double bonds, with three single bonds in between) would rearrange such that the double bonds shift to B-C and D-E, forming a new six-membered ring transition state. The result is a new structure where the former single bonds become double bonds, and vice versa.

However, the presence of the nitrogen atom in the bicyclic system might influence the rearrangement. If the vinyl group's double bond can conjugate with the nitrogen's lone pair, it could create some partial double bond character between N and adjacent carbons. The nitrogen's geometry within the bicyclic system might also play a role in the rearrangement.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I have an organic chemistry problem to solve involving a Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. I'll start by remembering that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift occurring in 1,5-dienes, which involves a cyclic transition state to form a new six-membered ring. This means the molecule must have a 1,5-diene structure for the rearrangement to happen.

Examining the compound: (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, it appears to be derived from norbornene. In its bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene part, the name suggests the presence of a norbornene structure, with three bridges: two bridges with two carbons each and one with a single carbon. The "2-aza" signifies a nitrogen atom at position 2, replaced from carbon, and "2-vinyl" indicates the nitrogen atom has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached. Furthermore, "hept-5-ene" implies a double bond exists at position 5. Notably, the stereochemistry is specified as S at position 1 and R at position 4.

In visualizing this, we have a norbornene framework with nitrogen at position 2, which carries a vinyl group. The bicyclic system has bridgehead carbons at positions 1 and 4, with a double bond potentially in the five-membered ring. But given the name "hept-5-ene," the double bond lies between carbons 5 and 6 of the six-membered ring, involving the bridge 1-5-6-4.

For position 2, we replace a carbon with nitrogen, hosting a vinyl group. Thus, the structure maintains its norbornene nature with modifications at position 2. The stereochemistry might influence the Cope rearrangement's transition state.

Next, verifying the presence of a 1,5-diene involves checking whether it conforms to a system with two double bonds separated by three single bonds. In this molecule, the vinyl group's double bond is considered at C2' (attached to N-2). The existing double bond is between C5 and C6. Tracing the path: starting from the vinyl group involving the nitrogen at position 2, connected via C1, reaching C5, and eventually to the C5=C6 double bond presents the path: vinyl double bond (C2'-C3') -> N-2 -> C1 -> C5=C6, showing the two double bonds are separated by three atoms, establishing a 1,5-diene system.

This configuration allows the molecule to undergo the Cope rearrangement, which typically involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift: rearranging the sigma bond between the adjacent atoms to become new double bonds, creating a potential new sigma bond between C2' and C5, and a new double bond elsewhere. In such rearrangements, the end double bond at C2'-C3' and the one at C5-C6 shift to form new bonds consistent with the typical Cope mechanism, effectively confirming the compatibility of the structure with the Cope rearrangement prerequisites.

Thus, the Cope rearrangement would proceed, aligning with typical [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement mechanisms given these structural connections. This confirms the hypothetical 1,5-diene setup and affirms the potential processing of the rearrangement accordingly.

The Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that requires a 1,5-diene system. The given compound, (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, contains a norbornene framework with a nitrogen atom at position 2 and a vinyl group attached to this nitrogen. The double bond in the norbornene system (C5-C6) and the vinyl group's double bond (CH₂=CH-) form a 1,5-diene system through the nitrogen atom and the bridgehead carbons.

During the Cope rearrangement, the 1,5-diene system undergoes a sigmatropic shift, leading to the formation of a new bicyclic structure. The vinyl group migrates, and the double bonds shift to form a new six-membered ring transition state. The rearrangement results in a new bicyclo[3.2.1]octene framework with the nitrogen atom positioned in a different bridge and the vinyl group incorporated into the new structure.

The stereochemistry at the bridgehead carbons (1S,4R) influences the product's configuration, leading to the final product (1R,5S)-3-vinyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene.

\boxed{(1R,5S)-3-vinyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene}

Alternatively, the Cope rearrangement here might form a new ring system. Let me try to track the positions. The [3,3] shift would move the allyl group from one position to another. Let's denote the positions again. Suppose the vinyl group is CH₂=CH- attached to N-2. The N-2 is part of the bicyclo system: connected to C1 and C3. The existing double bond is between C5 and C6. So during Cope, the sigma bond between C3' (from the vinyl) and C2' would shift, and another sigma bond might shift between C5 and C6. Wait, maybe it's better to think of the transition state as a six-membered ring where the two ends are the vinyl group and the C5-C6 double bond.

So the six-membered transition state would include C3', C2', N, C1, C5, and C6. The rearrangement would involve forming new bonds between C3' and C6, and between N and C5, while breaking the bonds between C2' and C3', and between C5 and C6. Wait, that doesn't seem right because that would not form a conjugated diene.

Alternatively, maybe the existing double bonds are C2'-C3' (vinyl) and C5-C6. The Cope rearrangement would form new double bonds between N and C1, and between C3' and C6, while single bonds form between C2'-N and C5-C6. Let me try to draw this step by step.

Original structure:

- N at position 2 has a vinyl group: N-CH2-CH2 (but actually, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so N connected to CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no, vinyl is -CH₂-CH2- but with a double bond. So maybe N is connected to a CH₂- group, which is double-bonded to another CH. So N-CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond between the two CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH-. So perhaps the structure is N-CH₂-CH₂, where the second CH₂ is double-bonded to another carbon. Wait, that's not possible. Let me clarify: the substituent on N is a vinyl group, which is -CH₂-CH₂_, but with a double bond between the two carbons. So the vinyl group is CH₂=CH2, but attached to nitrogen. So the nitrogen is attached to one carbon of the vinyl group (let's say the CH₂ part), which is double-bonded to the other carbon (CH2). So the substituent is -CH₂-CH2 with the double bond between the two adjacent carbons. Wait, no. Vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, so the structure would be N-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ carbons. So it's N-CH₂=CH2. No, that would make the vinyl group a substituent on the nitrogen, with the nitrogen connected to a CH₂, which is double-bonded to another CH₂. Wait, but in reality, a vinyl group is CH₂=CH2 minus a hydrogen, so when attached to nitrogen, it would be N-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two carbons. So maybe the structure is:

N
|
CH2-CH2
|   |
double bond

But that would be an imine or enamine structure. Wait, the compound is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo... So the nitrogen is at position 2 and is substituted with a vinyl group. So 2-aza means that the nitrogen is part of the bicyclo ring. So the bicyclo system has a nitrogen in place of carbon 2. The vinyl group is a substituent on that nitrogen. So the substituent on nitrogen is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two.

So in terms of connectivity, the vinyl group is a substituent on the nitrogen atom. The nitrogen is part of the bicyclic structure. Let me imagine the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system. The bridgehead carbons are 1 and 4. The nitrogen is at position 2. So N is connected to C1 and C3. Then, the vinyl group is attached to N. The ring double bond is between C5 and C6.

To envision the 1,5-diene, maybe the double bonds are N-C(vinyl) and C5=C6. The path from the vinyl's double bond to the ring's double bond passes through N, C1, C5. So there are three single bonds between the two double bonds: vinyl double bond (C2'=C3'), then bonds C3'-N, N-C1, C1-C5, C5=C6. But for a 1,5-diene, the two double bonds need to be conjugated through three single bonds, forming a six-membered transition state. However, the presence of the nitrogen might complicate things, but maybe it still participates.

In the Cope rearrangement, the two double bonds (C2'=C3' and C5=C6) would shift to form new double bonds between N and C1, and between C3' and C5, while converting the original double bonds into single bonds. This would result in the formation of a new bicyclic structure. Let's see:

Original bonds:

- C2'=C3' (vinyl group on N)
- C5=C6 (ring double bond)

After rearrangement:

- N-C1 becomes double bond
- C3'-C5 becomes double bond

But wait, need to track the sigma bonds shifting. The σ bond that was between N and C2' in the vinyl group may shift to form a bond between C3' and C5. Similarly, the σ bond between C5 and C6 (now double bond) would shift to form a bond between N and C1 (which was originally a single bond). Thus, forming two new sigma bonds: C3'-C5 and N-C1 (double bond?), but breaking the N-C2' and C5-C6 bonds. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, it's a [3,3] sigmatropic shift where the allyl fragments move. The vinyl group (C2'=C3') is one allyl fragment, and the ring's double bond (C5=C6) is another. But in this case, maybe the actual allyl fragments are N-C1-C5 and C6-C5-C4... Maybe not. Alternatively, the transition state involves the six-membered ring with the vinyl group and the C5-C6 double bond. 

Wait, perhaps the key is that the Cope rearrangement in aza compounds can result in the formation of a new ring. Since this is a norbornene system with a vinyl group on the nitrogen, after rearrangement, we might get a new bicyclic compound. Maybe an expanded ring due to the rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group migrates across the bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a 3-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene, but that may not make sense. Wait, the Cope rearrangement typically converts a 1,5-diene into another 1,5-diene. But in a cyclic system, it could lead to ring expansion or contraction. But given that this is a norbornene system, maybe the product is a different bicyclic compound.

Alternatively, considering the bridge structure. Let's imagine that during the Cope rearrangement, the vinyl group moves from the nitrogen to a position across the bridge, possibly creating a new bridge. Alternatively, it could form a seven-membered ring. However, given the bicyclo structure, it's more likely to form another bicyclo compound.

Wait, here's an alternative approach: look for examples of Cope rearrangements in similar bicyclic systems. For instance, in norbornene derivatives with substituents that allow the 1,5-diene. For example, if there's a substituent that, along with the existing double bond, creates the necessary 1,5-diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the nitrogen allows the formation of a conjugated diene through lone pair resonance. If the vinyl group is conjugated with the nitrogen's lone pairs, extending the conjugation path.

Alternatively, maybe after the Cope rearrangement, the product is a 8-membered ring, but more likely given the bicyclic system, it would remain bicyclic but with different bridge structures.

Wait, another thought: the Cope rearrangement here might convert the norbornene into a larger ring, but the presence of the nitrogen might lead to the formation of a different heterocycle. Alternatively, the vinyl group moving into the ring.

Wait, let's think about atom connectivity. The original compound is bicyclo[2.2.1], which suggests bridges of 2, 2, and 1 carbons. After the Cope rearrangement, a [3,3] shift would redistribute the bridge lengths. Suppose the vinyl group (attached to N) is part of a three-carbon segment that moves, leading to a new bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group at position 2 moves to position 5 or 6, forming a new bridge. Let me attempt to imagine the shift.

Considering the vinyl group on N-2, which is part of the bridge between C1 and C3. The Cope rearrangement would move one end of the vinyl group from N-2 to another position three atoms away, and the other end to another position. Hmm.

Alternatively, the C3' of the vinyl group would connect to C6, and C5 would connect to N. If the original bonds between C3'-N and C5-C6 are broken, and new bonds form between C3'-C6 and N-C5, that might recreate the bicyclic structure. Let's see. The original bridge structure is:

- C1 connected to C2 (which is N) and C5 and C7.

- N connected to C1, C3, and the vinyl group.

- C5 is connected to C1, C6, and part of the bridge to C4.

After the rearrangement, maybe C3' (of the former vinyl group) connects to C6, and N connects to C5. The double bonds would now be between N and C5, and between C3' and C6. Wait, but then the bridges might change. Let's check:

If C3' (from the vinyl group) bonds to C6, and N bonds to C5, then C5 is connected to N, and C6 to C3'. Let's see if this leads to a new bicyclic system. The original bridges were:

1. C1-C2(N)-C3 (2-membered bridge),

2. C1-C7-C4 (2-membered),

3. C1-C5-C6-C4 (1-membered; since C5 and C6 are connected by a double bond).

After the rearrangement, assuming C3' bonds to C6 and N bonds to C5:

C5 is now connected to N and C6 (if the double bond forms here? Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of sigma bonds. The Cope rearrangement involves breaking two sigma bonds and forming two new ones with a [3,3] shift. 

Original structure:

- The vinyl group is at N-2: N is connected to C1, C3, and the vinyl CH₂.

- The double bonds are in the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) and in the ring (C5=C6).

Post rearrangement:

The sigma bonds between N and CH₂ (of vinyl) and between C5 and C6 break. The new sigma bonds form between CH₂ (from vinyl) and C6, and between N and C5. The double bonds would be between CH₂ and N, and between C5 and C6? Hmm, no. When the sigma bonds shift, the double bonds reform. Wait, in a Cope rearrangement, the original double bonds (1,5) become single bonds, and the new double bonds form at the positions where the sigmatropic shift occurs. So the existing double bonds will become single, and new double bonds form between atoms that were formerly three bonds away.

Alternatively, visualizing as ABCD-E=F becoming A=B-C-D-E-F, then after rearrangement, A-B=C-D-E=F. Wait, not exactly. 

Alternatively, considering the general scheme for Cope rearrangement:

Starting with structure A-B=C-D-E-F=G, where the two double bonds are B=C and F=G, separated by three single bonds (D-E-F).

Wait, no, the classical Cope rearrangement is for 1,5-dienes. So the structure is like A-B-C-D-E, where A and E are double bonded. Wait, maybe I confused the numbering. Let's correct that: a 1,5-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 5-6, but separated by three single bonds (positions 3-4-5). Hmm, maybe not. Wait, 1,5-diene in the molecule would mean positions 1-2 double bond and 5-6 double bond with three single bonds in between (positions 3,4,5). Actually, the Cope rearrangement involves a 1,5-diene, meaning the diene system is conjugated over 1-2-3-4-5-6, with double bonds at 1-2 and 5-6. No, the 1,5-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 4-5, but I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, perhaps the Cope rearrangement operates on a 1,5-diene where the two ends are separated by three sigma bonds. For example, if you have a system like CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-, the diene is from 1-2-3-4-5-6, with double bonds at 1-2 and 5-6. Through a [3,3] shift, the double bonds move to 3-4 and the ends re-form.

But in our case, the molecule has 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene with a vinyl substituent on the nitrogen. The two double bonds are not in a straight chain but are in a bridged system. So the Cope rearrangement here might lead to a different bridged system.

Wait, I found a reference that states the Cope rearrangement of norbornene derivatives can lead to ring-expanded products. For example, 2-vinylnorbornene can undergo Cope rearrangement to form a 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octene system or similar. But since this is an aza compound, maybe it leads to an expanded ring with nitrogen.

Alternatively, maybe I need to number the atoms properly.

Original compound: bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Numbering starts at a bridgehead (position 1), goes to the next bridge (positions 2 and 3), then to the other bridgehead (position 4). Then positions 5, 6, 7 are the other carbons. If the double bond is at position 5, which is connected to position 6, then double bond is C5=C6.

The nitrogen is at position 2 (2-aza), which is part of the two adjacent bridges. The substituent on nitrogen is a vinyl group (-CH₂CH₂ with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups).

So the positions, when we look at the possible [3,3] shift, are:

The vinyl group's end (which is CH₂=CH-) is attached to nitrogen (position 2). The other end of the supposed diene is at C5=C6. The pathway from the vinyl group's double bond to the C5=C6 bridge involves the atoms: vinyl's CH₂-CH₂ (with the double bond), attached to N (position 2), then connected to C1 (position 1), then to C5 (which is part of the bridge between C1 and C4), then to C6.

So the sequence is CH₂=CH-N-C1-C5=C6. So between the two double bonds (CH₂=CH and C5=C6), there are three single bonds (CH-N-C1-C5). Hence, this forms a 1,5-diene required for the Cope rearrangement.

In such a setup, the Cope rearrangement would involve shifting the allyl group (CH₂=CH-N) and the allyl group (C5=C6) through a [3,3] sigmatropic shift. 

The transition state would form a six-membered ring involving the atoms: CH₂ (from vinyl), CH (from vinyl), N, C1, C5, and C6. However, because of the bicyclic system, this would lead to a new bridged structure.

After the rearrangement, new bonds would form between the former vinyl carbon and C6, and between N and C5. Breaking the original bonds between N and the vinyl carbon, and between C5 and C6.

So the new structure would have:

- A bond between the vinyl's former β-carbon (C3') and C6.

- A bond between N (position 2) and C5.

This would alter the bicyclic framework.

Originally, the bridges were:

1. C1-C2(N)-C3 (length 2),

2. C1-C7-C4 (length 2),

3. C1-C5-C6-C4 (length 1, with a double bond).

After rearrangement, if N is bonded to C5, and C3' (from the vinyl) is bonded to C6, the new bridge structure might be:

1. C1-C5-N (now connected to N at position 2),

2. C5-C6-CH2 (from the former vinyl group),

Possibly forming a new bridge between C5 and C3' (original vinyl CH2), and rearranged bridges elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to draw imaginary bonds:

Original bridgehead at C1 connects to N (C2), C5, and C7.

After rearrangement:

C1 would still be connected to C7 and C5?

No, if N is now bonded to C5, maybe C5 is connected to N (position 2) and C6 is connected to the former vinyl CH₂ (C3').

So the new bridge from N (position 2) would go to C5, and then from C5 to C6, and C6 is now connected to the former vinyl CH2, which is part of another bridge.

Alternatively, trying to map potential new bridges:

- C3' (the end of the vinyl) connected to C6.

- N connected to C5.

Thus, the original bridge from C1-C5 is now possibly broken, and a new bridge formed from C5-N-C2. Wait, not sure. Let me think again.

Original structure:

- The bridge from C1 to C2 (N) to C3.

- Another bridge from C1 to C7 to C4.

- Third bridge (the long one) from C1 to C5 to C6 to C4.

After rearrangement:

- Let's imagine C3' (from the vinyl) is now connected to C6.

- N is connected to C5.

So C5, connected to N and C6. But previously, C5 was connected to C1 and C6. Now, it's connected to N and C6. Then, C6 is also connected to C3' (from the former vinyl) and probably to C4. The original bridge C5-C6-C4 might now be adjusted to C6-C3', forming a new bridge.

But without a clear mental image, this is tricky. Perhaps an easier way is to consider the product of Cope rearrangement leading to a new bicyclic compound where the nitrogen is now part of a different bridge, and the vinyl group has moved.

An example of such a rearrangement, I recall, in norbornene derivatives, the Cope rearrangement often leads to the formation of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octene structure. So, the product here might be a 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-5-ene or similar, but with the vinyl group relocated.

Alternatively, considering the positions:

Start with bicyclo[2.2.1], after [3,3] shift, the bridge lengths could become 3, 2, 1. For example, bicyclo[3.2.1] would have bridges of 3, 2, and 1 carbons. Let's check: bicyclo[3.2.1]octane would have bridges of 3 carbons (between bridgehead to C3), 2 carbons between bridgehead and C..., etc. Not sure, but the key is that rearrangement results in an expanded bridge.

So, another possibility is that the original two-carbon bridge (C1-C2-C3) might expand to three carbons by including the vinyl group. So, new structure could have a three-carbon bridge from C1 to N (C2) to C5 (new bond N-C5) and then to a new carbon from the former vinyl group, C3'.

Wait, sorry, this is getting too vague. Perhaps I should look for a general outcome for such Cope rearrangements in bridged bicyclic systems. Alternatively, this could be similar to the oxabicyclo systems where Cope rearrangements lead to ring expansions. For instance, in endo-2-vinylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, also known as norbornene with a vinyl group, the Cope rearrangement yields bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene. So applying that logic here but replacing an oxygen with nitrogen, we would get an azabicyclo[3.2.1]octene.

Therefore, the possible product is a 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-5-ene derivative. But since we started with a vinyl group on nitrogen, perhaps the vinyl group becomes part of the new bridge. So, the vinyl group's former position is now part of the elongated bridge.

Trying to count the atoms: original bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has seven atoms. After incorporating the vinyl group into the bridge, the bridge might lengthen. However, in a Cope rearrangement, the total number of atoms should remain the same. So, 7-membered ring would become something else, but how?

Wait, no. The start is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene with seven atoms. The Cope rearrangement doesn’t add or remove atoms; it only rearranges bonds. So the product should also be a seven-membered bicyclic compound but with different bridge lengths. 

For example, original bridge lengths 2, 2, 1. After rearrangement, they could become 3, 2, 2 or another combination. Wait, but 2 + 2 +1 =5, which can't form the bicyclo system (bridges in bicyclo systems should add up to n atoms for a bicyclo[m.n.p] structure where m + n + p = total atoms - 2). Wait, maybe I should recall that bicycle[2.2.1]heptane has bridges of 2, 2, and 1 atoms, as previously explained.

After Cope rearrangement, if one bridge increases by one and another decreases by one, maybe it becomes bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane? But this might not be possible. Alternatively, if the vinyl group becomes part of a longer bridhe, such as the bridge from C5 to C3’ via N, then canute the numbers.

Alternatively, maybe the product is bicyclo[3.2.0], but 3+2+0=5 but with 7 atoms.

Alternatively, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe the correct product is (1R,5S)-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene or something similar. But I need specific guidance.

Alternatively, let me think about the chair-like transition state in Cope rearrangement. The 1,5-diene forms a chair transition state, and the shifts result in new bonds being formed. But since the molecule is bicyclic, the product would have a bridge that incorporates atoms from both original double bonds.

Wait, in a normal Cope rearrangement, the product's structure depends on the flexibility of the starting diene. In this case, the bicyclic system restricts movement, so the product will have to maintain bicyclic structure but reconfigured. 

Another approach: when a vinyl group is attached to a bridgehead in a norbornene, the Cope rearrangement forms a more strained bridge, but since nitrogen is involved, maybe a new azabicycle.

Perhaps the product is 5-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, but that doesn't seem to make sense. Wait, if the vinyl group moves to bridgehead position 5. Maybe not.

Alternatively, since Cope would shift the vinyl group to position 6 and form new bonds… 

Wait, considering hept-5-ene, then shifting the substituent to position 3?

Alternatively, looking at the procedure: in related examples, when norbornene derivatives with vinyl groups undergo Cope rearrangement, such as 2-vinylnorbornene, the product is bicyclo[3.2.1]octa-2,5-diene. For the aza analog, similar skeleton but with nitrogen.

In that case, the product would be 3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-5-ene or similar. However, the original compound has substituents with specific stereochemistry (1S,4R). Would the stereochemistry affect the product? Yes, the [3,3] shift transition state involves chair-like six-membered ring transition state, so the stereochemical outcome may depend on the configuration.

But since the problem states to identify the possible product and not its stereochemistry, maybe I can focus on the connectivity.

Assuming the rearrangement leads to expansion of one bridge from two carbons (between N and C1) to Maybe that bridge becomes three carbons, incorporating the vinyl group. For example, if the new bridge is from N to C5 (through the Cope shift), the original bridge from C1 to N (position 2) is part of the system.

Original bridge lengths: bridges between C1-C2 (N)-C3: 2 carbons.

Bridge between C1-C7-C4: 2 carbons.

Bridge between C1-C5-C6-C4: 1 carbon.

After rearrangement:

If N is now bonded to C5, and the former vinyl group’s carbon is bonded to C6, then the bridges might reform as:

Bridge 1: C1-C5-N-C3: 3 carbons.

Bridge 2: C1-C7-C4: 2 carbons.

 Bridge 3: C5-C6-(former vinyl carbon)-(now part of a bridge): Depending on where the vinyl carbon is connected.

But actually, It's more likely that the product will have bicyclo[3.2.1] structure. Specifically, the 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-5-ene. The numbering would be such that the longest bridge is 3 carbons (from C1 to N to C5 to some other carbon), medium bridge 2 carbons, and short bridge 1 carbon. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure becomes 3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene.

But perhaps there's a classic reference for such rearrangements. Wait, people have done studies on Cope rearrangements in anti- and syn-facial norbornene derivatives. For example, referencing "Acid Catalyzed Cope Rearrangements in 2-Vinylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene Systems" might show we get a bicyclo[3.2.1] product.

Alternatively, drawing an analogy to the oxabicycle. If the starting material is 2-vinyl-2-oxybicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, the Cope rearrangement would lead to contraction or expansion. But the exact product for the azabicycle would be similar but with nitrogen instead of oxygen.

Given all this, I think the major product would be 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene. The bicyclo登录码[3.2.1] system. So the starting material is a [2.2.1] bridge, and after rearrangement, it becomes [3.2.1]. The vinyl group moves such that one of its carbons becomes part of one of the bridges, pextended se.

So the key change is the expansion of one bridge from 2 carbons to 3 carbons. Thus, the new structure would be bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene with the nitrogen remaining in position 2. 

Alternatively, the old double bond was at 5-6. After rearrangement, the new double bond may be at a different position. So the product is 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene with the vinyl group transferred into the bridge structure.

As for the stereochemistry, the original bridgehead configurations (1S,4R) might influence the new bridgehead configurations. However, without specific data, it's challenging to assign, but the problem likely just wants the connectivity.

Therefore, the possible product of the Cope rearrangement is 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene.


**Final Answer**
The product of the Cope rearrangement is \boxed{(1R,5S)-3-vinyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The Cope rearrangement of **(1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene** proceeds via a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift of the 1,5-diene system formed by the vinyl group and the double bond in the norbornene framework. The key steps are as follows:

1. **1,5-Diene Identification**: The vinyl group attached to nitrogen (N2) and the double bond between C5 and C6 in the bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene create a conjugated 1,5-diene system (C3'=C2'-N2-C1-C5=C6).

2. **Rearrangement Mechanism**: The [3,3]-shift moves the σ-bonds, transferring the vinyl group to C5 and forming a new bond between N2 and C6. This results in a ring expansion, converting the bicyclo[2.2.1] system into a larger bicyclo[2.2.2] framework.

3. **Product Structure**: The rearrangement yields **5-vinyl-5-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene** as the product. In this structure:
   - The nitrogen is now part of a new bridge, bonding to C6.
   - The vinyl group is incorporated into the bicyclic system, forming a three-membered bridge and expanding the original bicyclo[2.2.1] to bicyclo[2.2.2].
   - The stereochemistry at the original bridgehead carbons (1S,4R) influences the transition state, but the bicyclo[2.2.2] product inherits the stereochemical complexity inherent in the rearrangement.

**Final Answer**:  
The product of the Cope rearrangement is **5-vinyl-5-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene**.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Since the compound is a bicyclo structure, rigidifying some parts of the molecule, the transition state might be constrained, leading to specific stereochemical outcomes.

Let me attempt to imagine the actual rearrangement. The original compound has the azabicyclo structure with N at position 2, a vinyl group attached to N, and the double bond at 5-6. The positions C2' (from the vinyl group), N2, C1, C5, and C6 would participate in the [3,3] shift. When the Cope rearrangement occurs, the sigma bonds reorganize. The C1-C5 sigma bond would break, and a new bond forms between N2 and C6. Simultaneously, the sigma bond between C2' and N2 would break, forming a new sigma bond between C2' and C5. But wait, the vinyl group is a two-carbon chain (CH₂-CH₂?), no. Wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-. So the vinyl group is C1', C2', where C2' is attached to nitrogen. So the vinyl group is attached to N-2 as NH-CH₂-CH₂? Or NH with CH₂=CH-?

Wait a second, the structure is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. This means that at position 2, there is a nitrogen (due to 2-aza), and it has a vinyl substituent. So the nitrogen at position 2 would have two adjacent carbons in the bicyclic system: positions 1 and 3. Since it's bicyclo[2.2.1], the bridge connections might be 1-2-3-4 (bridge 2 atoms) and another bridge from 1-7-4, and another from 1-5-6-4 (but only one carbon in each bridge here). Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the bicyclo structure.

In bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, the structure has two bridgehead carbons, say positions 1 and 4. Bridge 1-2-3-4 (two-carbon bridge), bridge 1-7-4 (also two-carbon bridge), and bridge 1-5-6-4 (one-carbon bridge). Wait, perhaps not, since the notation is bicyclo[m.n.p] where m >= n >= p. For bicyclo[2.2.1], the three bridges are m=2, n=2, p=1. The numbering is such that the longest bridge is first. So bridges between 1-2 (two carbons), 4-5 (two carbons), and 6-7 (one carbon). Hmm, perhaps I need to look up the standard numbering but maybe I need to adjust based on the double bond's position.

The given structure is hept-5-ene, so the double bond is between C5 and C6? Or C5 and C6 are part of the bridge. Let's suppose that the bridge that includes C5 is the one-carbon bridge, connecting C5 and C6 to C4. But maybe the numbering is such that bridge 1-2-3-4 is a two-carbon bridge (since m=2), bridge 4-5-6-1 is another two-carbon bridge (n=2), and bridge 1-7-4 is a one-carbon bridge (p=1). Wait, but standard bicyclo numbering would start from a bridgehead and alternate. Wait, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, the norbornene structure has two bridgehead carbons (numbered 1 and 4) connected by three bridges. So it's bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would have double bond between 5 and 6. Let me try to draw it mentally. Position 1 is connected to positions 2 and 7 (the two adjacent bridgeheads). Position 4 is connected to positions 3 and 5. The double bond is between 5 and 6. The 2-azabicyclo implies that the hydrogen at position 2 is replaced by nitrogen. The vinyl group is attached to that nitrogen.

Wait, perhaps it's better to sketch this. Nitrogen at position 2. The norbornene ring has bridgeheads at 1 and 4. The bridges are 1-2-3-4 (two carbons), 1-7-4 (two carbons?), maybe, but I'm a bit fuzzy. Regardless, the key point is the connectivity required for the 1,5-diene system. Let me consider the vinyl group attached to N2. The vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, connected to N2. The existing double bond in the bicyclohept-5-ene is between C5 and C6. If the vinyl group's double bond (C1'=C2') and the C5=C6 double bond are part of a 1,5-diene system, the arrangement would be C1'=C2'-N-C1-C5=C6. To be 1,5-diene, these two double bonds should be separated by three sigma bonds, which they are in this case. So yes, C1'-C2'-N-C1-C5-C6: so three sigma bonds between C1' and C5. Thus, when rearranged, the Cope rearrangement would form a new six-membered ring via a [3,3]-shift.

The mechanism would involve a transition state where the sigma bonds between N-C1 and C5-C6 would break, and new sigma bonds would form between C2'-C5 and N-C6, while the double bonds would shift. The product would be a new structure where the vinyl group has migrated closer to the former C5=C6 double bond. Wait, alternatively, the C1'(vinylic) would form a bond to what was originally C5, and the nitrogen would form a bond to C6.

Alternatively, considering the numbering during Cope rearrangement: the position of the new double bonds. The new double bonds would form between C2' and N, and between C1 and C5, perhaps. Let me think in terms of electron movement. Let's imagine the original molecule has the following skeleton: the nitrogen at position 2 is connected to C1 and C3 in the bicyclic system, and also bears a vinyl group (C2'=C3'). The double bond in the ring is between C5 and C6.

During the Cope rearrangement, the sigma bonds between C3' and C2', N2 and C1, and between C5 and C6 would undergo reorganization. The [3,3] shift would transfer the bonds so that a new double bond forms between N and C3', and between C1 and C5, while the original double bonds (C2'=C3' and C5=C6) become single bonds.

Wait, perhaps a curved arrow mechanism would help. Starting with the structure, the vinyl group's double bond (C2'=C3') and the C5=C6 double bond. The three sigma bonds in between are N, C1, and some bridge atoms. Alternatively, maybe the sigma bonds involved in the 1,5 relationship are C3'-C2' (vinyl), N-C2 (which isn't a carbon), but maybe C2 is nitrogen. Wait, I need to be cautious here.

Wait, nitrogen is at position 2. The vinyl group is attached to N2, so the structure is NH-CH2-CH2? No, since it's a vinyl group. So maybe N-substituted with CH2=CH- group. The structure would be N connected to C1 (bridgehead), C3 (bridge), and the vinyl group (CH2=CH-). Then the bicyclic system has a double bond between C5 and C6, which are adjacent in the ring.

Therefore, the 1,5-diene system consists of the vinyl group's C1'=C2' (assuming vinyl is CH2=CH-), then N is attached to C2', and C1 is attached to N. Then, from C1, there's a bridge to C2 (N's position), C3, C4 (the bridgehead), which is connected to C5 and C3's bridge.

Wait, maybe the positions adjacent to the vinyl group need clarification. Alternatively, if the vinyl group is two carbons attached to N, then N connects to CH₂=CH- (with N at position 2), then C1 is connected to N, leading to bridge structures. The 1,5-diene needs two double bonds separated by three single bonds. So:

C1' (from the vinyl group) = C2' - N (position 2) - C1 - C5 = C6. The three single bonds between the two double bonds (from C2' to C5) would make the required 1,5-diene. Therefore, yes, the Cope rearrangement can occur here.

The product would result from shifting the C1-C5 sigma bond to between N and C1', while shifting the double bonds. Alternatively, moving the vinyl group's sigma bond to C5, and forming new bonds.

When I perform the [3,3] shift, the sigma bond between N and C1 would shift to between C3' and C5, while the sigma bond between C2' and N would shift to between C1 and C6. The double bonds would re-form between N and C1' and between C5 and C2' ??? Hmm, this might be getting confusing.

Alternatively, considering the Cope rearrangement's general outcome where the ends of the 1,5-diene become sigma bonds connected to the middle atoms.

Let me think of the original 1,5-diene as:

C1'=C2' (vinyl group) ---N---C1---C5=C6 (ring double bond)

After rearrangement, the new single bonds form between C3' and C5, and between C2' and N, with the new double bonds forming between N and C1, which were previously single bonds, and between C1' and C6. Wait, but the bridge structure complicates things.

Alternatively, after rearrangement, the nitrogen could end up bridging different positions, perhaps forming a new bicyclic system. Given that the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, the product after Cope rearrangement might form a larger ring or a different bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, since the Cope rearrangement could lead to a new six-membered ring, maybe another bicyclic system. Taking a chance, the product could be 4-vinyl-4-azabicyclo[5.4.0]dec-1(7)-ene or something similar, but the specific ring sizes might differ.

Wait, perhaps it's a retro-Diels-Alder, but no, since it's Cope. Let me think again. The Cope rearrangement of 1,5-dienes yields another 1,5-diene. But around a cyclic system, this might result in a ring contraction or expansion. The starting bicyclic system has a bridge system that might become an expanded bridge.

Alternatively, maybe the product would be 3-vinyl-3-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene? Changing the bridge sizes. Wait, maybe.

Alternatively, let's think of the azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system undergoing Cope rearrangement, resulting in a larger ring. However, given that the 1,5-diene is part of the bridge system, the [3,3] shift could convert the norbornene ring into a different bicyclic system.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a seven-membered ring with an nitrogen and the former vinyl group incorporated into the ring, but it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps drawing a structure is necessary. Since the original compound has a bicyclo[2.2.1] system with a N and vinyl group, and after rearrangement, the positions of the vinyl and the double bond would shift.

Wait, let's think: The original diene is: (from vinyl to ring double bond) C1'=C2'-N-C1-C5=C6. After rearrangement, the end groups (C1' and C6) would now form new connections to C3 positions. Wait, in a typical acyclic Cope rearrangement, we get shifts leading to the new positions. For example, a 1,5-diene A-B=C-D-E=F would rearrange to B=C-D-E-F-G via the shift, but I'm not seeing how it rings closes.

Wait, perhaps the example would help. In a normal Cope rearrangement of 1,5-heptadiene, the molecule rearranges to a different heptadiene. In a cyclic system, such as norbornene derivatives, the Cope rearrangement might lead to another bicyclic compound.

Looking for similar examples. There’s a related example called the oxy-Cope when there's a hydroxyl group. The normal Cope rearrangement of norbornene derivates might produce another bicyclic system.

Wait, here's a thought. The starting material is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Applying the Cope rearrangement, which is a thermal [3,3] shift. If the 1,5-diene is part of the bicyclic system, rearrangement would result in a ring expansion or contraction. Suppose during rearrangement, the bridge is broken and a new bridge is formed.

Original bicyclo[2.2.1] has bridges of two, two, and one. After rearrangement, maybe the bridges become longer. For instance, suppose one bridge becomes three, another two, and another one, leading to bicyclo[3.2.1], but that’s just a guess.

Wait, alternatively, the azabicyclo system with a vinyl group might rearrange such that the nitrogen is now part of a different bridge.

Let me consider a hypothetical product. Suppose the vinyl group's former position (attached to N2) shifts to connect to the C5 carbon in the norbornene ring. Maybe after rearrangement, the nitrogen is connected to C6 instead of C1. The product would then have a new bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 5-vinyl-5-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene? But reversed positions? If the original double bond was between 5 and 6, maybe after shifting, the vinyl group is now at C5 and the double bond is somewhere else.

Alternatively, the Cope rearrangement of 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would shift the vinyl group into the bridge, creating a new bridge with the nitrogen in a different position.

Alternatively, referencing literature, sometimes the Cope rearrangement of rigid bicyclic systems such as norbornene derivatives gives fused rings or other bridged systems. One possible outcome in bicyclic systems is the conversion to another bicyclic structure where the substituents have shifted positions.

Given that, perhaps the main product would be 5-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene. That would involve a bridge extension from [2.2.1] to [2.2.2], indicating an added member in one of the bridges. However, verifying that requires some knowledge.

Alternatively, considering the Cope rearrangement would convert the system into a larger ring. If the original norbornene has seven atoms, adding carbons from the vinyl could lead to an eight-membered ring, but then again, via a bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, since the reaction involves a bicyclic structure, the product after rearrangement could be an annulene or a different bridge structure.

An alternative way to approach this is to note that the Cope rearrangement in bridge bicyclic systems like norbornene can lead to a ring-expanded product. For example, in some cases, a bridged bicyclo[2.2.1] system after Cope rearrangement becomes a bicyclo[3.2.1] system.

Wait, here's a possible direction: when norbornene derivatives undergo Cope rearrangement involving substituents that can form a 1,5-diene, the product is a bicyclo[3.2.1]octene derivative. Applying to our case, the 2-aza group with vinyl substituent, the rearrangement could lead to a bicyclo[3.2.1]octene structure with the nitrogen in a new position.

Alternatively, the vinyl group shifts into a bridge and forms a new bridgehead. Wait, let's imagine the process step by step. Starting with N2 attached to the vinyl. The double bond between C5 and C6. During the [3,3] shift, the N-linked group would move towards the C5 position, forming a new sigma bond between the vinyl end and C5. At the same time, the original sigma bond between N and C1 would move to form a bond between C6 and another position. If the vinyl group moves to C5, then maybe the new bicyclic system would have a larger bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps through the rearrangement, one bridge is elongated. For instance, the bridge between C1 and C4, originally length two, becomes three, leading to bicyclo[3.2.1].

If the original vinyl group shifts here, then, maybe the product is (5S,8R)-5-vinyl-5-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-2-ene. The stereochemistry would depend on the transition state. Since the original configuration at C1 and C4 was S and R, after rearrangement, the positions might map to new bridgeheads, but explaining that requires precise knowledge.

Alternatively, maybe the product is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1] heptane with changes in substituents, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, the vinyl group becomes part of a ring-expanded system, such as forming a pyrrolidine or other nitrogen-containing ring.

But perhaps an alternative approach is needed. The key factor is identifying the positions involved in the [3,3] shift. Let me revisit the structure:

The original molecule has a bicyclo[2.2.1] frame with N at position 2. The vinyl group on N and the double bond at 5-6 create a 1,5-diene system for the Cope rearrangement. Specifically, during the rearrangement, the bonds shift so that the vinyl group ends up at a position connected to C5, and the nitrogen connects to C6. The new double bonds form between N and C2 (or where).

But given the rigidity of the bicyclic system, the redistribution of bridges occurs. For example, one bridge could lengthen. Here's a hypothesis: the original bridges are 1-2-3-4 (two carbons), 1-7-4 (two), 1-5-6-4 (one). After rearrangement, the vinyl group that was attached to N might become part of the bridge between 1 and 4, so bridges 1-7-4 (becoming a three-carbon bridge including the vinyl groups) and 1-2-3-4 (two carbons), and perhaps 4-5-6 as before. However, this might not form a correctly fused ring.

Alternatively, in the transition state of the Cope rearrangement, the sigma bonds between C3' (of vinyl), N-C1, and C5-C6 shift so that new bonds form between C3' and C5, N and C6, and new double bonds form between C2'-C3' and C1-C5.

Wait, maybe not. Let's approach it mechanistically. In the Cope rearrangement of a 1,5-diene (A=B-C-D-E=F), the rearrangement forms new sigma bonds between A and D, and between C and F, and new double bonds form between B and C, and between E and F. Wait no, actually, the product becomes B=C-D-E-F, and A is connected to other parts. Maybe I need to reference the general mechanism.

In a [3,3] Cope rearrangement:

Original structure: CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂

But this would be 1,5-diene. Reorganization leads to movement of the ends. But perhaps bicyclic cases differ.

Alternatively, in a model where the azabicyclo compound's 1,5-diene consists of the vinyl group (positions 2' and 3') attached to N2, then through nitrogen to C1, C5, and then double bond C5-C6. The [3,3] shift would generate a new structure where positions 3' and 5 are connected, N2 and C6 connected, creating new double bonds between 2' and 3', and between C5 and C6. However, this seems to preserve the original double bonds, but rearranged into a new bridged structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-vinyl-3-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene. Changing from a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene to a bicyclo[2.2.2]octene system. This would imply the addition of one carbon in one bridge, from two to three bridges involving that newly-fused vinyl group.

The transition state would involve shifting the nitrogen connectivity from original positions to a new bridge. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a known structure (comparable to cubane's cousin), so perhaps the product involves expansion of one bridge from two to three members.

But without a clear model or example, it's a bit challenging. However, according to my reasoning, placing the vinyl group into a bridge, leading to a bicyclo[2.2.2] system makes sense. If so, the product would be a 3-vinyl-3-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene. Additionally, taking into account that the original stereocenters might influence the new structure's configuration. Therefore, the original (1S,4R) configuration could lead to specific configurations in the product, say, different bridgehead configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps an oxidative workup or hydrogen shifts could occur, but because the question just asks for the possible product of Cope rearrangement, it wouldn't involve other steps. Therefore, the most probable answer based on my analysis is the formation of a bicyclo[2.2.2]octene derivative with the vinyl group now part of one bridge and the nitrogen in a new position.

Alternatively, there is a formal example known as the Cope rearrangement in bicyclic systems. I recall that in some cases the Cope rearrangement leads to bridged cycloheptenes. Wait, maybe try to recall...

Wait, in some heteronorbornenes, Cope rearrangements can lead to ring-expanded products. For instance, in aza-norbornenes with appropriate substituents, the Cope rearrangement could produce a seven-membered ring or alter the bridge structure.

But considering lack of clear literature in mind, let's think structure-based:

The starting material (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene.

During Cope rearrangement:

1. 1,5-diene = vinyl (C2'=C3'), then through N2, C1, C5 (=C6).

Rearrangement via [3,3] shift leads to new bonds:

- C3' bonds to C5.

- N2 bonds to C6.

Hence, the new structure would have the nitrogen connected to C6, and the former vinyl carbon C3' connected to C5, creating a new bicyclic framework.

Original bridges:

- C1 connected via bridges to C4 through various paths. After rearrangement:

- C3'-C5 forms part of a bridge, and N2 connected to C6.

If N is connected to C6, perhaps forming a larger bridge. Perhaps forming a bridge from C1 to C4 via N (but N is in a new position). Maybe forming a bicyclo[3.2.1] system.

Alternatively, making a longer bridge: suppose now you have a bridge from C5 (formerly attached to C3') to N2 (now attached to C6). Such connectivity could lead to a bridge replacing the former C1-C5 connection.

This seems complex, but maybe the product is (5S,7R)-3-vinyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene or similar.

Given that the problem specifies the product of the Cope rearrangement for this compound, and that I might not have an exact example, I think "three-vinyl-three-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene" is a possible answer because expanding one bridge would fit the sigmatropic shift. However, configurations would alter based on the Cope rearrangement's transition state geometry.

Alternatively, the answer might feature an expanded bicyclo system where the initial 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1] becomes 5-azabicyclo[2.2.2]. Since during the rearrangement, the substituent shifts and enlarges the bridge.

To be more precise, here's what likely happens: the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to N2 engages in the 1,5-diene system through the bridge. The Cope rearrangement transfers the vinyl group from N to C5, and the nitrogen forms a bond to C6, thereby expanding one bridge from two carbons to three. This would result in a bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene framework. Therefore, the product would be 5-vinyl-5-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene. The numbering here is just a guess, but the key idea is the bridge expansion and the movement of the vinyl group to a bridgehead position.

Alternatively, if the original vinyl group merges into the skeleton forming a new two-carbon bridge, that aligns with bicyclo[2.2.2]. In this case, the bridge expansion from [2.2.1] to [2.2.2], with the vinyl now part of the bridge.

Given this deduction, I think the correct product is 5-vinyl-5-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene, although my confidence here is moderate. However, an alternative name considering the numbering could be possible. To confirm, one would need to analyze the regiochemistry of the Cope rearrangement in bicyclic systems.

Since the original molecule has the (1S,4R) configuration, the product may retain stereochemistry related to these centers, but since the bridges change, the configurations might transpose to new positions. Without knowing exact examples, I can’t determine the exact nomenclature, but considering bicyclo[2.2.2], called norbornane's bigger cousin, the answer is likely along those lines.

Alternatively, considering computational calculation or real mechanisms, in such bicyclic compounds, Cope rearrangement can lead new bridged systems. A study I vaguely recall mentions the synthesis of bridge-expanded rings via Cope rearrangements. Hence, the probable product is indeed bicyclo[2.2.2]octene derivative.

The Cope rearrangement of (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic shift of the 1,5-diene system formed by the vinyl group attached to nitrogen and the double bond in the bicyclic framework. This rearrangement leads to a ring expansion and reorganization of the bicyclic structure. 

**Key Steps:**
1. **Identification of 1,5-Diene:** The vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) on the nitrogen and the double bond between C5 and C6 in the norbornene system form a conjugated 1,5-diene system necessary for the Cope rearrangement.
2. **Rearrangement Mechanism:** The [3,3]-shift transfers the vinyl group's allyl fragment and the bicyclic system's allyl fragment, resulting in a new bicyclic structure with an expanded ring.
3. **Product Formation:** The product is a bicyclo[3.2.1]octene derivative where the nitrogen remains at position 2, and the vinyl group shifts to position 7. The stereochemistry at positions 1 and 4 is retained due to the concerted nature of the rearrangement.

**Product:**  
(1S,4R)-7-Vinyl-2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene

**Structure Explanation:**  
The original bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene framework expands to bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene. The vinyl group moves from the nitrogen to position 7, and the double bond shifts to C6-C7. The nitrogen remains at position 2, maintaining the stereochemistry at bridgehead carbons 1 (S) and 4 (R).

\boxed{(1S,4R)-7-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Now, considering the product structure, the rearrangement would transfer the vinyl group from the nitrogen to another position, forming a new bicyclic structure. The original bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system would reorganize. Let me attempt to draw this mentally.

Original structure: bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene with a nitrogen at position 2 (bridgehead between C1 and C4), and a vinyl group attached to N. The vinyl group is CH₂=CH₂- attached to N. The Cope rearrangement would shift the vinyl group's allyl portion (the three-carbon segment) and the adjacent allyl portion from the bicyclic system.

In the Cope rearrangement, the two ends of the 1,5-diene (the vinyl group and the existing double bond) would shift. The vinyl group's double bond (C2'-C3') and the bicyclic double bond (C5-C6) are separated by three single bonds (N-C1-C5), forming the 1,5-diene. The rearrangement would involve forming a new sigma bond between C3' (from the vinyl group) and C5 (from the bicyclic system), and a new double bond between C1 and C2' (the original N-C1 bond becomes a double bond?), but I need to check.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the Cope rearrangement involves breaking the sigma bonds between C1 and C5 (if that's part of the original structure) and forming new sigma bonds between C3' and C5, and between C1 and C2'. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since the Cope rearrangement is a concerted process where the two ends of the 1,5-diene swap positions. The original structure's 1,5-diene would be: starting from the vinyl group's double bond (C2'-C3'), then through N-C1-C5-C6=C5 (wait, perhaps the bicyclic system complicates this). Maybe the 1,5-diene is arranged as follows: the vinyl group's double bond (C2'-C3'), followed by N-C1-C5-C6=C5. Wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Let me clarify the structure.

The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system has seven atoms in total. The numbering starts at bridgehead 1, then goes to 2 (the nitrogen), then 3, 4 (another bridgehead), 5, 6, and 7. The double bond is between 5 and 6. The vinyl group is attached to nitrogen at position 2. So, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH₂ connected to N-2.

So, the 1,5-diene would start at the vinyl group's double bond (C2'-C3'), then go through N-2, C1, C5, and C6. Wait, but N-2 is connected to C1 and C3 (since in bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, bridgehead 1 is connected to 2 and 5; bridgehead 4 is connected to 3 and 5). Wait, perhaps I need to draw the structure properly.

Alternatively, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has bridges: between C1-C5 (two carbons), C5-C4 (two carbons), and C4-C1 (one carbon). Wait, no. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three bridges: two bridges of two carbons each and one bridge of one carbon. The numbering starts at a bridgehead (C1), then goes to C2 (adjacent bridgehead), then C3, C4 (another bridgehead), C5, C6, and C7. The bridges are C1-C5 (two carbons: C1-C6-C5?), perhaps. Wait, maybe I need to recall the bicyclo system.

Bicyclo[m.n.p] indicates three bridges with m, n, p carbons. For bicyclo[2.2.1], the three bridges have 2, 2, and 1 carbons. The structure is norbornane. The numbering starts at a bridgehead (C1), then proceeds to the adjacent bridgehead (C4), then the other bridgehead (C5). The bridges are C1-C2-C5 (two carbons), C5-C6-C4 (two carbons), and C4-C7-C1 (one carbon). Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has bridgehead carbons 1 and 4. The bridges are 1-2-3-4 (two carbons), 1-5-4 (two carbons), and 1-6-7-4 (one carbon). Wait, no. Let me check.

Actually, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three bridges: two bridges of two carbons each and one bridge of one carbon. The bridgehead atoms are C1 and C4. The bridges are:

1. Between C1 and C4 via C2 and C3 (two carbons: 1-2-3-4)
2. Between C1 and C4 via C5 (one carbon: 1-5-4)
3. Between C1 and C4 via C6 and C7 (two carbons: 1-6-7-4)

Wait, but that would sum up to three bridges. However, the correct structure of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is as follows: bridgehead atoms are C1 and C4. The three bridges are:

1. C1-C2-C3-C4 (two carbons)
2. C1-C5-C4 (two carbons)
3. C1-C6-C7-C4 (one carbon)

Wait, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has bridges of lengths 2, 2, and 1. The structure is such that there are two bridges with two carbons each and one bridge with one carbon. The correct numbering is:

Bridgehead atoms are C1 and C4. The bridges are:

1. C1-C2-C3-C4 (two carbons)
2. C1-C5-C4 (two carbons)
3. C1-C6-C4 (one carbon)

But that would sum to three bridges. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton has two bridgehead carbons (C1 and C4). The three bridges are:

1. C1-C2-C3-C4 (two-carbon bridge)
2. C1-C5-C4 (two-carbon bridge)
3. C1-C6-C4 (one-carbon bridge)

But that would require seven carbons: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7? Wait, no. Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has seven atoms. So:

Bridgehead C1 is connected to C2, C5, and C6.

Bridgehead C4 is connected to C3, C5, and C7.

The bridges are:

1. C1-C2-C3-C4 (two carbons)
2. C1-C5-C4 (two carbons)
3. C1-C6-C7-C4 (one carbon)

Wait, but that adds up to seven carbons:

C1 (bridgehead), C2, C3, C4 (bridgehead), C5, C6, C7.

Yes, that's seven. So the bridges are:

- C1-C2-C3-C4 (length 2)
- C1-C5-C4 (length 2)
- C1-C6-C7-C4 (length 1)

Wait, but the third bridge (C1-C6-C7-C4) has three bonds, which would be a bridge of two carbons (C6 and C7). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

Bridgehead C1 is connected to C2, C5, and C6.

Bridgehead C4 is connected to C3, C5, and C7.

The bridges:

- Between C1 and C4 via C2 and C3: two carbons (C2 and C3)
- Between C1 and C4 via C5: one carbon (C5)
- Between C1 and C4 via C6 and C7: two carbons (C6 and C7)

But bicyclo[2.2.1] implies that the three bridges have lengths 2, 2, and 1. So two bridges of two carbons each and one bridge of one carbon. Therefore, the structure would have:

- Bridge 1: C1-C2-C3-C4 (length 2)
- Bridge 2: C1-C5-C4 (length 1)
- Bridge 3: C1-C6-C7-C4 (length 2)

But this would require seven carbons: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7.

In this structure, the double bond is at position 5-6 (hept-5-ene), so between C5 and C6. Wait, but in the bicyclo system, C5 is connected to C1 and C4. If the double bond is between C5 and C C6 is part C6 is part of the bridge between C1 and C4 via C6 and C7. So C5-C6 would be a single bond normally, but in this molecule, it's a double bond (hept-5-ene). Therefore, C5 is double-bonded to C6, which is part of the bridge.

Now, the nitrogen is at position 2 (C2), replacing the carbon. So C2 is nitrogen. The vinyl group is attached to N-2. So N-2 has substituents: the bicyclic system (connected to C1 and C3) and a vinyl group (CH₂=CH₂).

So, the structure is:

- Bridgehead C1 connected to N-2, C5, and C6.
- Bridgehead C4 connected to C3, C5, and C7.
- N-2 is connected to C1, C3, and the vinyl group (CH₂=CH₂).
- Double bond between C5 and C6.

Now, the 1,5-diene required for Cope rearrangement must be present. Let's trace the possible conjugated diene. The vinyl group (CH₂=CH₂) attached to N-2. The double bond is between C5 and C6. The question is whether these two double bonds are part of a 1,5-diene system.

Starting from the vinyl group's double bond (between the two carbons of the vinyl group, let's say C2' and C3'), then through N-2, C1, C5, C6. Wait, but N-2 is connected to C1 and C3. So the path from the vinyl group's double bond (C2'-C3') would go through N-2 to C1, then to C5 (since C1 is connected to C5), and then to C6 (since C5 is connected to C6 via a double bond). So the sequence is C2'-C3' (vinyl double bond) -> N-2 -> C1 -> C5 -> C6 (double bond). The distance between the two double bonds is three single bonds (N-C1, C1-C5, C5-C6?), but wait, C5-C6 is a double bond. Wait, perhaps the 1,5-diene is arranged as follows: the vinyl group's double bond (C2'-C3'), followed by N-2-C1-C5-C6=C5? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group's double bond is conjugated through the nitrogen to the C5-C6 double bond. But nitrogen's lone pair might disrupt conjugation. However, for the Cope rearrangement, conjugation isn't necessary; it's the 1,5-diene arrangement in terms of connectivity, not conjugation.

The Cope rearrangement requires a 1,5-diene, meaning two double bonds separated by three single bonds in a row. So, if we have a structure like A=B-C-D-E-F=G, then A=B and F=G are the two double bonds separated by C-D-E-F (three single bonds). But in this case, the vinyl group is attached to N-2, which is connected to C1, which is connected to C5, which is connected to C6 (double bond). So the path is vinyl double bond (C2'-C3') -> N-2 -> C1 -> C5 -> C6=C5? Wait, C5 is connected to C6 via a double bond. So the sequence would be C3' (from vinyl) connected to N-2, which is connected to C1, which is connected to C5, which is connected to C6 via a double bond. So the two double bonds are separated by three single bonds: N-2-C1, C1-C5, C5-C6. Therefore, this forms a 1,5-diene arrangement (positions 1 to 5 in terms of the atoms between the two double bonds). Thus, the Cope rearrangement is feasible.

Now, during the Cope rearrangement, the sigma bonds between C1-C5 and between N-2-C3' (vinyl) would shift. The rearrangement would form new sigma bonds between C3' and C5, and between N-2 and C1 (but wait, N-2 is already connected to C1). Alternatively, perhaps the rearrangement involves moving the vinyl group's allyl system and the bicyclic system's allyl system.

In a typical Cope rearrangement, the 1,5-diene undergoes a [3,3] shift. For example, in 1,5-pentadiene, the rearrangement would form another 1,5-pentadiene isomer. In this case, the bicyclic system complicates things. The rearrangement would likely form a new bicyclic structure.

Let me try to imagine the transition state. The Cope rearrangement involves a cyclic transition state where the two ends of the 1,5-diene (the vinyl group and the C5-C6 double bond) rotate to form new bonds. The allyl portions (three-carbon segments) at each end of the 1,5-diene would swap places.

In this case, the vinyl group (C2'-C3') is one allyl fragment, and the C5-C6 double bond is part of another allyl fragment (C5-C6-C7, perhaps). However, the bicyclic system may mean that the allyl fragment from the bicyclic part is C5-C6-C4 or something else.

Alternatively, considering the atoms involved in the rearrangement: the vinyl group's allyl is N-2-C1-C5 (since N-2 is connected to C1, which is connected to C5), and the other allyl is C5-C6-C7 (since C5 is connected to C6 and C4). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

In the Cope rearrangement, each of the two three-carbon segments (allyl groups) involved in the [3,3] shift must be conjugated. The first allyl group is the vinyl group (C2'-C3') plus the adjacent atom (N-2), but allyl groups are three carbons with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the allyl groups here are C3'-N-2-C1 and C5-C6-C7? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the rearrangement involves breaking the sigma bonds between N-2 and C3' (vinyl) and between C5 and C6, then forming new sigma bonds between C3' and C5, and between N-2 and C6. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, considering the standard Cope rearrangement mechanism: the two ends of the 1,5-diene undergo a [3,3] shift. In this case, the 1,5-diene is arranged as follows: C3' (from vinyl) connected to N-2, which is connected to C1, connected to C5, connected to C6 (double bond to C5). So the 1,5-diene is C3'-N-2-C1-C5-C6. The rearrangement would form a new 1,5-diene by shifting the allyl groups. The new structure would have a sigma bond between C3' and C5, and a new double bond between N-2 and C1? Or perhaps between C1 and C5?

Wait, perhaps visualizing the transition state as a chair-like six-membered ring where the original sigma bonds break and new ones form. The atoms involved would be C3', N-2, C1, C5, C6, and the adjacent carbons. The rearrangement would transfer the vinyl group's allyl (C3', N-2, C1) to a new position, connecting C3' to C5 and C1 to C6, while forming a new double bond between N-2 and C1 or between C5 and C6.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a new bicyclic compound where the vinyl group has moved. Given the complexity of the bicyclic system, the product might be a larger ring or a different bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, considering that the Cope rearrangement of a norbornene derivative could lead to a ring-expanded product. For example, norbornene's Cope rearrangement typically forms a bicyclo[3.2.1] structure, but with the nitrogen present, the product might differ.

Wait, perhaps looking for examples. The Cope rearrangement of 2-vinylnorbornene would form a new bicyclic compound. In this case, with a nitrogen present, the product would be a 2-aza-bicyclo structure. Alternatively, the nitrogen's position might lead to different regiochemistry.

Alternatively, the product could be a 7-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene or something similar. The ring expansion from a bicyclo[2.2.1] to bicyclo[3.2.1] is plausible in Cope rearrangements.

But let's try to work it out step by step. The original molecule is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene with a vinyl group on N-2. After Cope rearrangement, the vinyl group's three-carbon fragment (allyl) and the bicyclic system's three-carbon fragment (allyl) swap positions.

The original allyl groups are:

1. From the vinyl group: C2'-C3' (double bond) connected to N-2.
2. From the bicyclic system: C5-C6 (double bond) connected to C1 and C4.

During the rearrangement, the C3' (from vinyl) would connect to C5, and the C6 would connect to N-2. This would form a new bicyclic system. Let's see:

Original connections:

- N-2 connected to C1, C3, and vinyl (C2'-C3').
- C1 connected to N-2, C5, C6.
- C5 connected to C1, C4, C6 (double bond).
- C6 connected to C5 (double bond), C1, C7.
- C4 connected to C3, C5, C7.

After rearrangement:

- The sigma bond between N-2 and C3' breaks, and a new bond forms between C3' and C5.
- The sigma bond between C5 and C6 breaks, and a new bond forms between C6 and N-2.

This would result in:

- N-2 now connected to C6, C1, and C3.
- C5 now connected to C3', C4, and C1.
- The double bonds would shift: the original vinyl double bond (C2'-C3') might become a single bond, and a new double bond forms between N-2 and C1 or between C5 and C3'.

Wait, but in the Cope rearrangement, the double bonds shift positions. The original 1,5-diene's two double bonds (vinyl and C5-C6) become new double bonds in the product. The exact positions depend on the transition state.

Alternatively, the new double bonds would be between C1 and C2' (from the original N-2-C1 single bond) and between C3' and C5 (from the original C5-C6 double bond shifting). But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclo[3.2.1]octene derivative. Let's count the carbons. The original molecule has seven carbons (heptene), but with a vinyl group (two carbons) attached to nitrogen. Wait, but the vinyl group is a substituent, so the total carbons would be seven in the bicyclic system plus two from the vinyl group, totaling nine? No, wait, the vinyl group is part of the substituent on nitrogen, so the bicyclic system itself is seven-membered (heptene), with nitrogen replacing a carbon. The vinyl group adds two more carbons (CH₂=CH-), making the total substituent on nitrogen a three-atom group (N-CH₂-CH₂-?), no, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, so attached to N, it's N-CH₂-CH₂-? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH2, but as a substituent, it's -CH₂-CH₂- with a double bond. Wait, no: a vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, so attached to nitrogen would be N-CH₂-CH₂- with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no: the vinyl group is CH₂=CH2, but when attached as a substituent, it's -CH₂-CH2 with a double bond between the two carbons. So the nitrogen at position 2 has a substituent of -CH₂-CH₂-, where the first CH₂ is connected to N, and the second CH₂ is double-bonded to the first. So the vinyl group is N-CH₂-CH₂- with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups (i.e., N-CH₂-CH₂- becomes N-CH₂-CH₂- but with a double bond: N-CH₂-CH₂- would actually be N-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond, it's N-CH₂=CH2. Wait, no: the vinyl group is CH₂=CH-, so attaching to nitrogen would be N-CH₂-CH2 with the double bond between the two CH₂ carbons. So the substituent on nitrogen is -CH₂-CH₂- with a double bond between the first and second carbon, making it a vinyl group: N-CH₂-CH₂- where the first CH₂ is connected to N and the second CH₂ is double-bonded to the first. So the structure is N-CH₂-CH₂- with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups: N-CH₂-CH₂- becomes N-CH₂=CH2.

But in any case, during the Cope rearrangement, the vinyl group (two carbons with a double bond) would shift along with the bicyclic system's allyl group.

Assuming the rearrangement forms a new bicyclic system, perhaps bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene, with the nitrogen now at a different position. Alternatively, the product could be a larger ring, but given the bicyclic nature, it's more likely to form a new bicyclic compound.

Alternatively, the product might be 7-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene. Let's see: the original bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has seven members. After rearrangement, adding the vinyl group's two carbons would make nine, but since the vinyl group is part of the substituent, perhaps the ring expands by one carbon, making an eight-membered bicyclo[3.2.1]octene.

Alternatively, the vinyl group becomes part of the bicyclic system. For example, the original vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to N-2 becomes part of a new bridge in the bicyclic system after rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrogen moves to a different position. Given the complexity, maybe the product is (1S,4R)-7-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene. The numbering would adjust, but the key is the new bicyclic framework.

Alternatively, considering the stereochemistry: the original compound has (1S,4R) configuration. The Cope rearrangement is stereospecific, so the stereochemistry might be preserved or inverted depending on the transition state.

Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the most plausible product is a bicyclo[3.2.1]octene derivative with the vinyl group incorporated into a new bridge. The exact structure would have the nitrogen in a different position, and the double bond shifted. However, without a visual, it's challenging, but based on typical Cope rearrangements in norbornene systems, the product is often a bicyclo[3.2.1]octene. Given the presence of nitrogen, the product would be 2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene with a vinyl group at a new position, possibly at C7.

Alternatively, the vinyl group might end up at position 7, leading to 7-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene. This seems plausible. The original double bond at C5-C6 shifts to C6-C7, and the vinyl group moves to C7.

Alternatively, the product could be bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene with the nitrogen at position 2 and a vinyl group at position 7. The stereochemistry would depend on the transition state, but since the original stereochemistry is (1S,4R), the product might retain similar configurations.

After considering all possibilities, I'll conclude that the product of the Cope rearrangement is (1S,4R)-7-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene.
