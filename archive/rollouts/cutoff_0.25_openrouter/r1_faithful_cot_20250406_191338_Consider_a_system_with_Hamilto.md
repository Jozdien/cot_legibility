The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are determined by recognizing that the Pauli matrices in any direction \(\vec{n}\) have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). Scaling by \(\varepsilon\) results in eigenvalues \(\pm \varepsilon\). 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Express the Hamiltonian:** \( H = \varepsilon (n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z) \).
2. **Matrix Representation:** The matrix form of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{pmatrix}\).
3. **Characteristic Equation:** Solve \(\det(H - \lambda I) = 0\):
   \[
   \det\left(\begin{pmatrix} \varepsilon n_z - \lambda & \varepsilon (n_x - i n_y) \\ \varepsilon (n_x + i n_y) & -\varepsilon n_z - \lambda \end{pmatrix}\right) = 0
   \]
4. **Compute Determinant:**
   \[
   (\varepsilon n_z - \lambda)(-\varepsilon n_z - \lambda) - \varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2) = 0
   \]
5. **Simplify Using \(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\):**
   \[
   \lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2 = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm \varepsilon
   \]

**Answer:** The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\boxed{+\varepsilon}\) and \(\boxed{-\varepsilon}\).

Alright, so I need to find the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what the Pauli matrices are. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, and σz, right? They are 2x2 matrices, so this Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix as well. Since n is a unit vector, its components are nx, ny, nz such that nx² + ny² + nz² = 1. 

So, the Hamiltonian is H = ε (nx σx + ny σy + nz σz). I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix in any direction (like σ · n) are ±1. But here, it's scaled by ε, so maybe the eigenvalues are ±ε? Let me check that.

Wait, eigenvalues of σ · n should be ±1 because for any unit vector n, the Pauli matrix in that direction has eigenvalues 1 and -1. So multiplying by ε would scale those eigenvalues to ε and -ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H should be ε and -ε. But let me verify this more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the eigenvalues explicitly. The general Pauli matrix in the direction of n is:

σ · n = nx σx + ny σy + nz σz = [[nz, nx - i ny], [nx + i ny, -nz]]

So, H = ε times that matrix. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve det(H - λ I) = 0.

Let's compute the matrix H first:

H = ε * [[nz, nx - i ny], [nx + i ny, -nz]]

So, H - λ I is:

[[ε nz - λ, ε (nx - i ny)], [ε (nx + i ny), -ε nz - λ]]

The determinant is (ε nz - λ)(-ε nz - λ) - [ε (nx - i ny)][ε (nx + i ny)]

Let me compute each part:

First term: (ε nz - λ)(-ε nz - λ) = (-ε nz)(ε nz) + (-ε nz)(-λ) - λ(ε nz) - λ^2

Wait, maybe better to multiply it out:

(a - b)(a + b) = a² - b² if a and b are numbers, but here a is ε nz - λ and b is ε nz + λ? Wait, no, actually, the first term is (ε nz - λ)(-ε nz - λ) = - (ε nz + λ)(ε nz - λ) = -[(ε nz)^2 - λ^2] = -ε² nz² + λ²

Wait, maybe that's a better way. Let me see:

(ε nz - λ)(-ε nz - λ) = - (ε nz - λ)(ε nz + λ) = -[(ε nz)^2 - λ^2] = -ε² nz² + λ²

Then the second term is [ε (nx - i ny)][ε (nx + i ny)] = ε² (nx - i ny)(nx + i ny) = ε² (nx² + ny²) because (a - ib)(a + ib) = a² + b².

So, the determinant becomes:

[-ε² nz² + λ²] - ε² (nx² + ny²) = 0

But since n is a unit vector, nx² + ny² + nz² = 1, so nx² + ny² = 1 - nz². Therefore, substituting:

[-ε² nz² + λ²] - ε² (1 - nz²) = 0

Simplify:

-ε² nz² + λ² - ε² + ε² nz² = 0

The -ε² nz² and +ε² nz² cancel out, leaving λ² - ε² = 0

Therefore, λ² = ε² => λ = ±ε

So the eigenvalues are ε and -ε. That matches my initial thought. So regardless of the direction n, the eigenvalues are ±ε. That makes sense because the Pauli matrices are spin-1/2 operators, and their eigenvalues in any direction are ±1/2 ħ, but here we have ε scaling them. Wait, but actually, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, not ±1/2. The spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ, so their eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. But here, the Hamiltonian is ε times σ · n, so the eigenvalues should be ε times ±1, so ±ε. 

Therefore, the answer is that the eigenvalues are ε and -ε. Let me just check if there's another way to see this. The Hamiltonian H is proportional to the component of the spin in the direction n, scaled by ε. The eigenvalues correspond to the possible outcomes of measuring that component, which are ±ε. So yes, that seems right.

Alternatively, since the Pauli matrices are traceless and Hermitian, their sum in any direction is also traceless and Hermitian. The trace of H is ε (nz - nz) = 0, which is the sum of the eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are a and -a, their sum is zero, which matches. The determinant of H is (ε^2)(nz^2 + nx^2 + ny^2 - nz^2) = ε^2 (nx^2 + ny^2). Wait, no, wait. Wait, determinant of H is product of eigenvalues, which would be (-ε^2). Wait, from the previous calculation, determinant is λ² - ε² = 0, so determinant of H - λ I is zero when λ² = ε². But determinant of H itself is determinant of ε (σ · n). Since determinant of σ · n is (nz)(-nz) - (nx - i ny)(nx + i ny) = -nz² - (nx² + ny²) = - (nx² + ny² + nz²) = -1. Therefore, determinant of H is ε² * (-1). So determinant is -ε². But the product of eigenvalues is (ε)(-ε) = -ε², which matches. So that's consistent.

Therefore, all checks out. The eigenvalues are ±ε.

Okay, let's see. I need to determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. As I recall, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, and σz are 2x2 matrices, implying that this Hamiltonian is also a 2x2 matrix. Given that n is a unit vector, its components nx, ny, and nz satisfy the condition nx² + ny² + nz² = 1.

Expanding the Hamiltonian, I get H = ε (nx σx + ny σy + nz σz). I seem to remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix in any direction, like σ · n, are ±1. However, in this case, the Hamiltonian is scaled by ε, which suggests that the eigenvalues might be ±ε. Let me take a closer look at this.

On second thought, the eigenvalues of σ · n should indeed be ±1 because for any unit vector n, the Pauli matrix in that direction always has eigenvalues 1 and -1. Consequently, multiplying by ε would scale those eigenvalues to ε and -ε. So, it appears that the eigenvalues of H should be ε and -ε. However, to be more confident, I should verify this more rigorously.

As an alternative approach, I could try to compute the eigenvalues explicitly. The general Pauli matrix in the direction of n can be written as:

Alright, I need to determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. Let me begin by revisiting the Pauli matrices, which are σx, σy, and σz. These are 2x2 matrices, meaning the Hamiltonian is also a 2x2 matrix. The vector n being a unit vector means its components nx, ny, and nz satisfy nx² + ny² + nz² = 1.

Thus, the Hamiltonian can be expressed as H = ε (nx σx + ny σy + nz σz). I recall that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix in any direction, like σ · n, are ±1. However, here it's scaled by ε, so the eigenvalues might be ±ε. I need to verify this.

Actually, the eigenvalues of σ · n should indeed be ±1 because in any unit vector direction n, the Pauli matrix yields eigenvalues of 1 and -1. Therefore, multiplying these by ε scales the eigenvalues to ε and -ε. Consequently, the eigenvalues of H should indeed be ε and -ε. Nevertheless, I should double-check this by computing them explicitly.

Alternatively, I could calculate the eigenvalues directly. The general Pauli matrix in the n direction is:

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), we start by noting that \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector. The Pauli matrices in the direction of \(\vec{n}\) form the matrix:

\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z
\]

Writing out the matrix explicitly using the Pauli matrices:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

we get:

\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

The Hamiltonian is then:

\[
H = \varepsilon \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \(\det(H - \lambda I) = 0\):

\[
\det\left( \begin{pmatrix} \varepsilon n_z - \lambda & \varepsilon (n_x - i n_y) \\ \varepsilon (n_x + i n_y) & -\varepsilon n_z - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = 0
\]

Calculating the determinant:

\[
(\varepsilon n_z - \lambda)(- \varepsilon n_z - \lambda) - [\varepsilon (n_x - i n_y)][\varepsilon (n_x + i n_y)]
\]

Expanding the terms:

\[
- (\varepsilon^2 n_z^2 - \lambda^2) - \varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2)
\]

Using the fact that \(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\), we substitute \(n_x^2 + n_y^2 = 1 - n_z^2\):

\[
- \varepsilon^2 n_z^2 + \lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2 (1 - n_z^2) = \lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2 = 0
\]

Solving for \(\lambda\):

\[
\lambda^2 = \varepsilon^2 \implies \lambda = \pm \varepsilon
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \(\boxed{+\varepsilon}\) and \(\boxed{-\varepsilon}\).

n = nx σx + ny σy + nz σz.

Let me write this matrix out. The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

σz = [[1, 0],
       [0, -1]]

Therefore, σ · n should be:

[[nz, nx - i ny],
 [nx + i ny, -nz]]

So H = ε times that matrix. To find eigenvalues, we need to solve det(H - λ I) = 0.

Let me write H - λ I:

[[ε nz - λ, ε (nx - i ny)],
 [ε (nx + i ny), -ε nz - λ]]

The determinant is (ε nz - λ)(-ε nz - λ) - [ε (nx - i ny)][ε (nx + i ny)].

Compute this:

First part: (ε nz - λ)(-ε nz - λ) = - (ε nz - λ)(ε nz + λ) = -[(ε nz)^2 - λ^2] = - ε² nz² + λ².

Second part: [ε (nx - i ny)][ε (nx + i ny)] = ε² (nx² + ny²) + other terms? Wait, (nx - i ny)(nx + i ny) = nx² + (i ny)(-i ny) + nx i ny - i ny nx. Wait, actually, expanding (a - b)(a + b) with a = nx, b = i ny:

= a² - b² = nx² - (i ny)² = nx² - (-1) ny² = nx² + ny². Because i² = -1. So yes, that product is ε² (nx² + ny²).

Thus, determinant becomes:

- ε² nz² + λ² - ε² (nx² + ny²) = 0.

But since nx² + ny² + nz² = 1, nx² + ny² = 1 - nz². Substitute this into the determinant equation:

- ε² nz² + λ² - ε² (1 - nz²) = - ε² nz² + λ² - ε² + ε² nz² = λ² - ε² = 0.

So this gives us λ² = ε², hence λ = ± ε. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ε and -ε. Whoa, that worked out nicely! So even though the matrix looks complicated with nx, ny, nz, all those components cancel out, and the eigenvalues just depend on the magnitude ε. That makes sense because the Pauli matrices are all traceless and have eigenvalues ±1, so scaling by ε would lead to ±ε. The direction of the vector n just determines the eigenvectors, not the eigenvalues. So the answer is the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \boxed{+\varepsilon} and \boxed{-\varepsilon}.

To determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, we start by noting that the Pauli matrices in any direction \(\vec{n}\) have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). Scaling by \(\varepsilon\) will adjust these eigenvalues to \(\pm \varepsilon\).

To verify this explicitly, we expand the Hamiltonian as:
\[
H = \varepsilon (n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z)
\]
The matrix representation of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is:
\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]
Thus, the Hamiltonian \(H\) becomes:
\[
H = \varepsilon \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]
To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \(\det(H - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \left( \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon n_z - \lambda & \varepsilon (n_x - i n_y) \\ \varepsilon (n_x + i n_y) & -\varepsilon n_z - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \right) = 0
\]
Calculating the determinant:
\[
(\varepsilon n_z - \lambda)(-\varepsilon n_z - \lambda) - [\varepsilon (n_x - i n_y)][\varepsilon (n_x + i n_y)]
\]
Simplifying the first term:
\[
(\varepsilon n_z - \lambda)(-\varepsilon n_z - \lambda) = \lambda^2 - (\varepsilon n_z)^2
\]
Simplifying the second term:
\[
[\varepsilon (n_x - i n_y)][\varepsilon (n_x + i n_y)] = \varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2)
\]
Combining these results:
\[
\lambda^2 - (\varepsilon n_z)^2 - \varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2) = \lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)
\]
Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\), leading to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2 = 0
\]
Solving this gives the eigenvalues:
\[
\lambda = \pm \varepsilon
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \(\boxed{+\varepsilon}\) and \(\boxed{-\varepsilon}\).

n = nx σx + ny σy + nz σz = [ [nz, nx - i ny], [nx + i ny, -nz] ]

So, the Hamiltonian H is:

H = ε [ [nz, nx - i ny], [nx + i ny, -nz] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(H - λ I) = 0.

Calculating the determinant:

| ε nz - λ        ε (nx - i ny)          |
| ε (nx + i ny)  -ε nz - λ       |

The determinant is (ε nz - λ)(-ε nz - λ) - [ε (nx - i ny)][ε (nx + i ny)]

Expanding the first term:

(ε nz - λ)(-ε nz - λ) = - (ε nz)^2 - ε nz λ + ε nz λ + λ^2 = - (ε nz)^2 + λ^2

Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. Multiplying (a - b)(-a - b) where a = ε nz and b = λ:

(a - b)(-a - b) = -a² -a b + a b + b² = -a² + b². So yes, that simplifies to λ² - (ε nz)^2.

Then the second term is - [ε (nx - i ny)][ε (nx + i ny)] = - ε² (nx² + ny² + i nx ny - i nx ny - (i)^2 ny²) = - ε² (nx² + ny² + ny²) ?

Wait, let me compute (nx - i ny)(nx + i ny):

Multiply them out: nx² + i nx ny - i nx ny - i² ny² = nx² + ny², since i² = -1, so -i² ny² = ny². Therefore, (nx - i ny)(nx + i ny) = nx² + ny².

Therefore, the second term is - ε² (nx² + ny²).

Putting it all together, the determinant becomes:

λ² - (ε nz)^2 - ε² (nx² + ny²) = λ² - ε² (nz² + nx² + ny²)

But since n is a unit vector, nx² + ny² + nz² = 1. Therefore, the determinant simplifies to:

λ² - ε² (1) = λ² - ε² = 0

Solving λ² - ε² = 0 gives λ = ± ε.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are ε and -ε. That confirms my initial thought. So regardless of the direction of the unit vector n, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H = ε σ · n are always ±ε. This makes sense because the Pauli matrices in any direction have eigenvalues ±1, and scaling by ε just scales the eigenvalues accordingly.

Alternatively, another way to see this is by noting that the Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin operator in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of the spin operator in any direction are ±ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles, but here we have σ matrices which are proportional to the spin operators (specifically, σ = 2S/ħ). However, in this case, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, so the eigenvalues would indeed be ±ε, since σ · n has eigenvalues ±1.

Therefore, regardless of the approach—whether by direct computation of the determinant or by recognizing the properties of the Pauli matrices—the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator are \boxed{+\varepsilon} and \boxed{-\varepsilon}.

To determine the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, we start by expressing the Hamiltonian in matrix form. The Pauli matrices are:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Given \(\vec{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)\) with \(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\), the Hamiltonian becomes:

\[
H = \varepsilon (n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z)
\]

Substituting the Pauli matrices, we get:

\[
H = \varepsilon \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x - i n_y \\ n_x + i n_y & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \(\det(H - \lambda I) = 0\):

\[
\det \left( \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon n_z - \lambda & \varepsilon (n_x - i n_y) \\ \varepsilon (n_x + i n_y) & -\varepsilon n_z - \lambda \end{bmatrix} \right) = 0
\]

Calculating the determinant:

\[
(\varepsilon n_z - \lambda)(-\varepsilon n_z - \lambda) - \varepsilon^2 (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = 0
\]

Simplifying the terms:

\[
-(\varepsilon n_z)^2 + \lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2) = 0
\]

Using the fact that \(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\), we substitute \(n_x^2 + n_y^2 = 1 - n_z^2\):

\[
-\varepsilon^2 n_z^2 + \lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2 (1 - n_z^2) = 0
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\lambda^2 - \varepsilon^2 = 0
\]

Solving for \(\lambda\):

\[
\lambda^2 = \varepsilon^2 \implies \lambda = \pm \varepsilon
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\boxed{\varepsilon}\) and \(\boxed{-\varepsilon}\).

σ · n = nx σx + ny σy + nz σz. Let's write this matrix out. The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]

σy = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

σz = [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ]

Therefore, substituting into σ · n:

H = ε [ nx [0, 1; 1, 0] + ny [0, -i; i, 0] + nz [1, 0; 0, -1] ]

Multiplying through by ε:

H = ε [ [nz, nx - i ny], [nx + i ny, -nz] ]

To find eigenvalues, we need to compute det(H - λ I) = 0.

That is, the determinant of [ [ ε nz - λ, ε (nx - i ny) ], [ ε (nx + i ny), - ε nz - λ ] ].

The determinant is:

(ε nz - λ)(- ε nz - λ) - [ε (nx - i ny)][ε(nx + i ny)].

Let me compute this term by term.

First term: (ε nz - λ)(-ε nz - λ) = - (ε nz)(ε nz) - ε nz λ + ε nz λ + λ² = - (ε^2 nz²) + λ² - Hmm wait, let's multiply it out step by step.

(ε nz - λ)(- ε nz - λ) = - ε² nz² - ε λ nz + ε λ nz + λ². Wait, that seems like cross terms cancel? Yes, the two middle terms: -ε λ nz + ε λ nz = 0. So remaining terms are: - ε² nz² + λ². That's simpler.

Second term: [ε (nx - i ny)][ε(nx + i ny)] = ε^2 (nx - i ny)(nx + i ny) = ε^2 (nx² + (i ny)(-i ny) + i nx ny - i nx ny). Wait, the cross terms should cancel here as well. Let's expand (nx - i ny)(nx + i ny):

That's nx·nx + nx·i ny - i ny·nx - i ny·i ny

Simplify term by term:

nx² + i nx ny - i nx ny - i² ny²

Since i nx ny - i nx ny cancels out, i² is -1, so:

nx² - (-1) ny² = nx² + ny²

Therefore, the second term is ε² (nx² + ny²)

Therefore, putting it all together:

The determinant is: (-ε² nz² + λ²) - ε² (nx² + ny²) = 0

Simplify:

λ² - ε² nz² - ε² (nx² + ny²) = 0

But notice that n being a unit vector, nx² + ny² + nz² = 1, so nx² + ny² = 1 - nz²

Which gives us:

λ² - ε² nz² - ε² (1 - nz²) = λ² - ε² nz² - ε² + ε² nz² = λ² - ε² = 0

Solving for λ:

λ² = ε² → λ = ± ε

Therefore, regardless of the direction of the unit vector n, the eigenvalues are ε and -ε. Hence, even though the Hamiltonian's matrix form depends on n, the eigenvalues only depend on the magnitude ε. This makes sense since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 in any direction, and here it's scaled by ε. So, the eigenvalues are indeed ±ε.

**Final Answer**
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \boxed{\varepsilon} and \boxed{-\varepsilon}.
