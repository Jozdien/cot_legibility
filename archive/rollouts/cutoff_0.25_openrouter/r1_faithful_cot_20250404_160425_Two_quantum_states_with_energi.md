To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) s and \(10^{-8}\) s, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty (or natural linewidth) of each state is inversely proportional to its lifetime:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

For the first state (\(\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\) s):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the second state (\(\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\) s):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

The total linewidth (sum of uncertainties) for resolving both states is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly distinguish the energy levels, the energy difference must be significantly larger than this combined uncertainty. An energy difference of \(1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV}\) (1 micro-electronvolt) is sufficient as it exceeds the total linewidth of \(7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}\).

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Alright, so I have this problem here where there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The question is asking which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options aren’t listed, but I guess I need to figure out the method to determine the answer.

First, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty in its energy. This comes from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, right? The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ (the reduced Planck constant). So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. 

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. But sometimes for simplicity, people just say approximately ħ. That means the energy uncertainty or the natural line width of a state is inversely proportional to its lifetime. So, a shorter lifetime means a larger energy uncertainty, which would correspond to a broader line width in the spectral line. If two energy levels have overlapping uncertainties, then they can't be clearly resolved. Therefore, to resolve them, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe?

Hmm, so I need to calculate the energy uncertainties due to their lifetimes first. Let me write that down. ΔE1 = ħ / (2*Δt1) and ΔE2 = ħ / (2*Δt2). Here, Δt1 is the lifetime of the first state, which is 10^-9 seconds, and Δt2 is 10^-8 seconds. Then the total energy uncertainty, if they interact, would be the sum of both uncertainties? Or maybe the square root of the sum of squares? Wait, I think when the uncertainties are independent, they add in quadrature. But since these are two separate energy levels, each with their own lifetime, when we look at the transition between them, the energy uncertainty in the transition would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because if each energy level has an uncertainty, the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the two uncertainties.

So, Total ΔE = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt1) + ħ/(2Δt2)

But let me confirm that. If you have two energy levels, E1 and E2, each with an uncertainty ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE = |E1 - E2| would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). Wait, no, actually if you have two independent variables, the uncertainty in their difference is the same as the uncertainty in their sum because it's sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2). But in terms of linewidths, I think the observed linewidth of a transition between two states is given by the sum of the natural linewidths of each state. Because the transition's linewidth is due to the finite lifetimes of both states involved. So, maybe the total linewidth Γ = Γ1 + Γ2, where Γ1 = 1/(2πτ1) and Γ2 = 1/(2πτ2). Wait, I might be confusing different definitions here.

Let me recall that the natural linewidth (Γ) is related to the lifetime (τ) by Γ = ħ / τ. But sometimes it's written as Γ = 1/(2πτ) depending on convention. Wait, hmm. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, so ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). Therefore, for each energy level, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2*10^-9 s) and ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (2*10^-8 s). Then maybe the uncertainty in the energy difference would be ΔE_total ≈ sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )? Because the uncertainties are independent.

But actually, the frequency linewidth is often stated in terms of full width at half maximum (FWHM), which for a Lorentzian line shape is Γ = ħ / τ. Alternatively, the relation could be Γ = 1/(π τ) when considering radiative broadening. Wait, different sources may use different conventions here. Let's be careful. Let's check out the precise relation.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle: the energy-time uncertainty is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2.

If the lifetime of the state is τ, then Δt = τ, so ΔE ≥ ħ/(2τ). So, the minimum uncertainty in energy is ħ/(2τ). But I think in the context of spectral lines, the natural linewidth is usually given by Γ = ħ / τ. If τ is the mean lifetime, then Γ (the linewidth) is equal to ħ / τ. Therefore, Γ = ħ / τ.

But earlier, from HUP, Γ would be at least ħ/(2τ). Maybe different conventions here. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: The relation between the lifetime τ and the energy width Γ (as FWHM) is Γ = ħ / τ. For example, when you have exponential decay, the Fourier transform gives a Lorentzian line shape with FWHM of Γ = ħ/τ. Therefore, Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Then the total linewidth when considering a transition between these two states would be the sum of the two linewidths? That is Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).

But maybe it's the energy difference between the two levels and the uncertainty in that difference. If the energy difference is ΔE = |E1 - E2|, then the uncertainty in this energy difference would be Δ(ΔE) = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), but if the linewidth is additive, then actually Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2.

But in order to resolve two spectral lines, the energy difference should be greater than the linewidth. The Rayleigh criterion in spectroscopy says that two peaks are resolved if their separation is at least equal to their FWHM. But in quantum terms, if the energy difference between the two levels is much larger than their combined linewidths, then they can be clearly resolved. So, if the energy difference ΔE is greater than Γ_total, then they can be resolved. However, some sources might use the sum, others may use the quadrature sum.

Wait, so maybe let's confirm which one is correct.

Suppose each energy level has a linewidth Γ1 and Γ2. When you have a transition between them, the total linewidth would be Γ1 + Γ2. Because the photon emitted (or absorbed) has an uncertainty from both the upper and lower states. Therefore, to resolve two energy levels, the separation between them must be greater than the sum of their linewidths. So, energy difference ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.

Alternatively, if they’re right next to each other, like overlapping lines, then you can't distinguish them, so if their energy difference is larger than the combined width, they can be resolved. So according to that, ΔE should be at least Γ1 + Γ2.

OK, so in this problem, the lifetimes are given as τ1 = 10^-9 s, τ2 = 10^-8 s.

So, first, let me compute Γ1 and Γ2.

Assuming Γ = ħ / τ.

Where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ≈ 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s

Compute Γ1:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J

Similarly, Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J

Wait, but energy differences are usually expressed in electron volts (eV), so perhaps we need to convert these values to eV?

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J

Therefore,

Γ1 in eV:

Γ1 = (1.0545718e-25 J) / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV

Similarly, Γ2 = (1.0545718e-26 J) / (1.602176634e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-8 eV

Thus, the total line width is Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV

So, the energy difference ΔE between the two states needs to be larger than this total linewidth in order to resolve the levels. Therefore, answer options should have energy differences larger than approximately 7.24e-7 eV. Wait, but maybe we need to convert linewidths from Γ to ΔE.

But let me just verify this.

Alternatively, using HUP directly, ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. But for a state with lifetime τ1, the energy uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. Then, ΔE_total = sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2) ≈ ħ sqrt(1/τ1^2 + 1/τ2^2). Wait, this would be if the uncertainties are independent. But if your two energy levels are being measured in a transition, then maybe the uncertainty in their difference is the sum of the uncertainties. Since in transitions, the photon's energy uncertainty comes from both the initial and final states. Hence, the total uncertainty in energy of the photon is Γ1 + Γ2. Because the upper state lifetime contributes Γ1 and the lower state’s lifetime (if it’s a final state) contributes Γ2. Therefore, the uncertainties add. Wait, actually, if the lower state is the ground state, it has an infinite lifetime, which would mean Γ2 approaches zero. But in our case, both states have finite lifetimes. So in reality, when a photon is emitted from the upper state to the lower state, the transition's linewidth is affected by the lifetime of the upper state and the lifetime of the lower state.

But I've heard the natural linewidth is primarily determined by the lifetime of the excited state, because the ground state is usually stable (infinite lifetime). However, if both states have finite lifetimes, then I suppose their linewidth contributions add. For a more precise analysis, I should maybe use the formula for the linewidth caused by the decay rates of both states.

Yes, looking back, to calculate the natural linewidth of a transition between two energy levels, both with finite lifetimes, the total linewidth is the sum of the linewidths (Γ) of each state. Therefore, total Γ = Γ1 + Γ2, where Γ1 and Γ2 are the linewidths (inverse lifetimes multiplied by ħ) of the two states.

Therefore, according to that, the energy difference must be greater than Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 to be resolved. So energy difference ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.

So if Γ1 is about 6.58e-7 eV and Γ2 is about 6.58e-8 eV, their sum is approximately 7.24e-7 eV. Therefore, the energy difference should be larger than ~7.24e-7 eV. So, possible answer options would be, say, 1e-6 eV (which is 1 microelectronvolt) or higher.

But actually, let me go back to the units. Maybe the linewidth Γ is usually expressed in terms of angular frequency. Since Γ = ħ / τ is in energy units. But to convert into frequency, you can use Γ = ΔE / ħ. Wait, no, actually ΔE = Γ. If Γ is the energy uncertainty, then the frequency uncertainty would be Δν = Γ / h, since E = hν. Hmm, perhaps.

Alternatively, using Γ (in angular frequency units) = 1/τ. So the linewidth in angular frequency is Δω = 1/τ. Then converting to energy, ΔE = ħ Δω = ħ * (1/τ). So yeah, same as before.

Alternatively, when dealing with lifetime broadening, the FWHM in terms of angular frequency is Γ = 1/τ, so the energy FWHM is ΔE = ħ Γ = ħ / τ.

Yes, so the previous calculation stands.

Therefore, ΔE needs to be greater than 7.24e-7 eV. So if the options are given as multiple-choice answers, we need to look for the smallest energy difference that is larger than this value.

But wait, let's think again. The question is about distinguishing the two energy levels, which might not necessarily be a transition between them. Maybe I made an error in going from energy level uncertainties to the linewidth of a transition. If we just have two energy levels, each with their own uncertainty in energy, then the uncertainty in their energies could be a different consideration. Because the question is about "clearly distinguishing these two energy levels," which probably means that their energy difference should be much larger than the uncertainties in each individual energy. Because if the uncertainties (due to finite lifetimes) are similar to the energy difference, then the energies cannot be clearly resolved. Therefore, to "clearly" resolve them, their energy difference should be much larger than the uncertainty in their energies. Therefore, how do their individual uncertainties play a role here?

Suppose each energy is measured with some uncertainty, due to their lifetime, so their energies are E1 ± ΔE1 and E2 ± ΔE2. Then, overlapping uncertainties would make them indistinguishable. Well, in such a case, if the difference in central energy values (ΔE) is greater than the sum of their uncertainties, i.e., |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2, then even in the worst case (where one energy is on the high end of its uncertainty and the other on the low end), they are still separate. So following this logic, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

Alternatively, sometimes people use the quadrature sum (sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2)) for uncertainties. But when you have two energy levels, their uncertainties are independent, so the total uncertainty in the energy difference (as a measurable quantity) would be sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2). Therefore, in order for the energy difference to be "clearly" resolved, the actual energy difference would need to be much larger than this uncertainty. A common criterion (e.g., for peaks in a spectrum) is Rayleigh's criterion, which would require a separation of at least the FWHM of the peaks. If the peaks have different widths, there might be different criteria, but in the case where each energy level has its width, perhaps the combined uncertainty is defined as the sum?

But in order to avoid going too deep into the specifics, perhaps an answer that the energy difference should be larger than ~1e-6 eV (since the sum of the two computed Γ values is ~7e-7 eV) so any option significantly larger than 7e-7 would suffice.

Alternatively, converting the inverse lifetimes to energies. Another approach:

The natural linewidth ΔE is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. For τ1 = 1e-9 s:

ΔE1 ≈ (1.0545718e-34 J*s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J

Convert that to eV: 1.0545718e-25 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV

Similarly, for τ2=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.0545718e-26 J → 6.58e-8 eV.

Therefore, the total uncertainty is sum (6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8) = ~7.24e-7 eV.

Therefore, energy difference should be higher than this. So, the possible answer could be on the order of 1e-6 eV (which is 1 microelectronvolt) or higher.

But usually, in practical terms, energy level differences are much larger. For example, atomic energy levels are typically on the order of eV, so maybe even nano-eV differences could be difficult to resolve. However, given the numbers here, maybe the answer they expect is using the heuristic that the energy difference needs to be on the order of the inverse of the lifetime converted to energy.

But let me think another way. When you have a transition between two energy levels, the linewidth emitted photon's energy will have uncertainty ΔE = ΔE1 + ΔE2 (including both lifetimes). So, to resolve the energy levels, the energy separation must be larger than ΔE_photon. Thus, ΔE_levels > ΔE_photon ≈ ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).

Calculating that, as before, total ΔE_photon ≈ ħ (1e9 + 1e8) [since τ1 is1e-9, thus 1/τ1 is 1e9 Hz? Wait, let's use units properly.

Actually, 1/τ1 has units of 1/s. So ω (angular freq) would be in radians/sec, but here physical frequency ν = 1/(2πτ). But regardless, in terms of energy, we can combine everything.

ΔE_photon ≈ ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2) To compute this value:

1 / τ1 = 1e9 1/s
1 / τ2 = 1e8 1/s

So, ΔE = 1.0545718e-34 J*s * (1e9 + 1e8) 1/s = 1.0545718e-34 * 1.1e9 ≈ 1.16e-25 J

Convert to eV: 1.16e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 7.24e-7 eV

Same as before. Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV. So if the options include values like 1e-6 eV (1 microelectronvolt), 1e-7 eV (0.1 microelectronvolt), etc., the correct answer would be greater than ~7.24e-7 eV.

But many times in exams, people use the formula ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. So maybe even just the individual contributions, even though my calculation said sum. Wait, in one of my schools, I was taught that transition linewidth is dependent on only the upper state for spontaneous emission. But actually, in reality, if the lower state also has a linewidth, it might contribute when measuring transitions. But perhaps in this question, since both levels have finite lifetime, their contributions to the energy difference need to be considered.

But maybe we need to consider each state’s width, and for the energy levels to be resolved, it’s not the transition linewidth but each level’s own width.

Wait, the question says "clearly distinguish these two energy levels." If we have a spectroscopic measurement of the two levels, so that we can resolve them as separate peaks. If each level has a width (uncertainty in energy) due to their lifetime, the energy separation must be much larger than their individual uncertainties to be able to say they’re separate.

But in that case, the resolution would depend on their individual linewidth. If the separation between the two energy levels is much larger than each of their linewidths, then maybe that’s enough. But probably if the separation is larger than the sum or combined linewidth. 

Wait, no. Suppose you have two energy levels E1 and E2. Each with their own uncertainty. To resolve them, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty with which you can measure them. But if their uncertainties (due to their lifetimes) are ΔE1 and ΔE2, you need |E1 - E2| to be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to be sure that even considering the uncertainties, they don’t overlap.

If |E1 - E2| > ΔE1 + ΔE2, then the error ranges (E1 ± ΔE1 and E2 ± ΔE2) would not overlap, hence they can be clearly resolved.

But if they’re only separated by a small amount, they might overlap.

Therefore, here, the question is: the energy difference should be greater than ħ/ (2*τ1) + ħ/(2*τ2). Because each energy level has its own energy uncertainty.

How is that different from the previous calculation? Hmm:

Earlier, sum of Γ1 and Γ2 where Γ = ħ/τ. So the sum was (ħ/τ1 + ħ/τ2). So the same as ( (1e-9 s^-1 +1e-8 s^-1 )*ħ ). But in terms of what's needed to resolve two peaks, the critical value is indeed that sum, so it's equivalent to both.

However, whether the HUP uses 1/(2τ) or not might lead to differing factors here.

This raises a red flag. The uncertainty in energy for each state would be:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2*τ1), and ΔE2 = ħ/(2*τ2)

Then sum these to get ΔE1 + ΔE2 = (ħ/2)(1/τ1 +1/τ2 ). Which would be half of the previous Γ1 + Γ2.

If this is used, the target energy difference needed would be ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. So, then if calculating (note: per original HUP inequality, which says ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2). So, in reality, ΔE ≈ ħ/(2*Δt)*sqrt(2) for some distributions.

But perhaps the question is assuming the linewidth approach, where Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2. Because in spectroscopy, the natural linewidth is indeed considered as Γ = ħ/τ. For exponential decay, the Fourier transform of a decaying exponential gives a Lorentzian line shape with FWHM Γ = 1/τ (in angular frequency), which when multiplied by ħ gives Γ (as energy) = ħ/τ. Therefore, FWHM in energy is ħ / τ.

That seems standard.

So going back, Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 ≈ 1e-25 J ~ 6.5e-7 eV.

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1e-26 J ~ 6.5e-8 eV.

Total Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 7.2e-7 eV.

Hence, to observe two distinct peaks, the energy difference must be greater than this total linewidth, keeping with the notion that the separation must be larger than the sum of the individual linewidths.

Therefore, options given for the energy difference should be at least ≈ 1e-6 eV or higher. However, looking at common energy scales in quantum systems, 1e-6 eV corresponds to microwave or lower frequencies. But depending on the context, sometimes approximations are made to orders of magnitude. For example, if the energy difference is 1e-5 eV, then we can resolve; if the options are 1e-6, 1e-7, 1e-8, etc.

But without the exact options, I can't say for sure, but the benchmark seems to be approximately 1e-6 eV. Or perhaps even people using rough estimates of ħ ≈ 1e-15 eV·s (since ħ ≈ 6.6e-16 eV·s). Wait, convert ħ into eV·s:

1 J = 1.6e-19 eV. So ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s = 1.05e-34 / 1.6e-19 eV·s ≈ 6.6e-16 eV·s.

Thus:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.6e-16 eV·s /1e-9 s = 6.6e-7 eV

Γ2= 6.6e-16 /1e-8 = 6.6e-8 eV

Sum ≈ 7.26e-7 eV ≈ 0.7 microelectronvolt

Therefore, to clearly resolve two levels with uncertainties 0.7 microeV, we need their energy difference to be significantly larger than 0.7 microeV. Then options with, say 1e-6 eV (1 microvolt) would be sufficient. If the options are all orders of magnitude apart, e.g., a) 1e-4 eV, b) 1e-5 eV, c) 1e-6 eV, d)1e-7 eV, the the answer would likely be c) 1e-6 eV.

But if, for instance, one of the options is 10^-5 eV. Wait: 10^-5 eV is 10 microelectronvolt, which would be ten times larger than 0.7 microeV, and good enough to resolve. But in exams sometimes even twice is considered enough.

Hmm, the problem says "clearly" distinguish, so energy difference must be significantly larger than  the total linewidth.

But without given options, maybe I should compute it in precise terms:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.5823e-16 eV s)/(1e-9 s) = 6.5823e-7 eV ≈ 0.658 μeV

Γ2 = (6.5823e-16 eV s)/(1e-8 s) = 6.5823e-8 eV ≈ 0.0658 μeV

Sum Γ_total ≈ 0.7238 μeV

Thus, ΔE ≫ 0.724 μeV. Since "clearly" means the energy difference must be larger, perhaps by a factor of a few, say A few times. Frequency resolution typically calls for at least a FWHM of separation. So according to the Rayleigh criterion, the peaks should be separated by at least the sum of their FWHM. So 0.724 μeV or higher. So ΔE > 1 μeV (1e-6 eV) is safer. So the correct answer would need to have ΔE >~1e-6 eV. Since the options are not given, but in case of options presented in different magnitudes, like 1e-6,1e-7,... then 1e-6 would be properly in excess of Gamma's sum. Therefore, ANSWER should be  \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}} or something similar. But since originally depleted.

Wait, lets cross check:

Calculate E in another unit if desired, inverse time.

Convert 1eV to  s^-1, since energy is related to frequency via E = hν.

h= Planck's constant= 4.1357e-15 eV·s.

Thus, Γ1 = 0.658 μeV corresponds to:

ν1= E/h = (0.658e-6 eV) / (4.1357e-15 eV s) ≈ 1.59e8 Hz ~ 159 MHz.

Similarly, τ1 is 1 ns, lifetime. The Fourier limited linewidth should be \delta ν ≈1/(2π τ)≈1/(6.28e-9)~ 160 MHz, which aligns with the previous calculation. Thus, same order.

Γ_total is sum of FWHM, so converting both τ to linewidths.

But how to turn this into the required energy gap?

As per previous, needing separated by approximate linewidth sum ~0.72 μeV.

If analyze up to step:

To clearly resolve two energy levels, the energy difference should be ^at least^ the sum of their linewidths. Therefore, ΔE >= Γ1 + Γ2.

Hence, if the energy level difference is 10^{-6} eV, which is roughly 1 μeV, greater than Γ total of 0.72 μeV, then they can be resolved. But just barely. However, maybe they need to be several times that linewidth difference to really be considered "clear". In real-life, depending on measurement techniques, sometimes need a factor of 2 or more.

But if the options don't include numbers such as 1e-6, let's think about possible unit conversions. Alternatively, compute directly in Joules:

Γ_total = 7.24e-7 eV. Let's convert that to J:

That's 7.24e-7 eV * 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.16e-25 J.

Energy-time uncertainty: perhaps transformation into other terms. Alternatively (but not likely), based on time-energy with detectors? Not sure.

Alternatively: Heisenberg uncertainty in each energy level:

Maybe start from the geometry of the problem. If you wait a time T, the linewidth in energy is Γ. So to distinguish two lines separated ΔE, you need T ~ ħ / ΔE. But I don't know if that's applicable.

Wait, according to the time-energy uncertainty principle, the energy can only be measured to a precision ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, where Δt is the measurement time. But in this context, the measurement time is limited by the lifetimes of the states. So perhaps ΔE improvement possible.

Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the two-level system with emission and stuff. Hmm. Seems the original reasoning still holds: Γ = ħ/tau for each energy level, the visibility requires ΔE > Γ. Therefore, the answer is ΔE > 0.7e-6 eV. So whichever option is just above that or sufficiently larger. Since the options aren't here, but in the PRC or translated as boxed.

In general, according to the detail calculations, the combined linewidth is approximately 0.7 microelectronvolts. Therefore, the energy difference between the two levels should be greater than this; typically, multiple times to clearly resolve. For example, if the options are 10^-5 eV (ten times larger) or 10^-6 eV (slightly larger), the minimal answer would be 10^-6, since 0.7 × 10^-6 is slightly less than 10^-6.

So boxed answer reasonable assumption is \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Alright, so I have this problem here where there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The question is asking which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options aren’t listed, but I guess I need to figure out the method to determine the answer.

First, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty in its energy. This comes from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, right? The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ (the reduced Planck constant). So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. 

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. But sometimes for simplicity, people just say approximately ħ. That means the energy uncertainty or the natural line width of a state is inversely proportional to its lifetime. So, a shorter lifetime means a larger energy uncertainty, which would correspond to a broader line width in the spectral line. If two energy levels have overlapping uncertainties, then they can't be clearly resolved. Therefore, to resolve them, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe?

Hmm, so I need to calculate the energy uncertainties due to their lifetimes first. Let me write that down. ΔE1 = ħ / (2*Δt1) and ΔE2 = ħ / (2*Δt2). Here, Δt1 is the lifetime of the first state, which is 10^-9 seconds, and Δt2 is 10^-8 seconds. Then the total energy uncertainty, if they interact, would be the sum of both uncertainties? Or maybe the square root of the sum of squares? Wait, I think when the uncertainties are independent, they add in quadrature. But since these are two separate energy levels, each with their own lifetime, when we look at the transition between them, the energy uncertainty in the transition would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Because if each energy level has an uncertainty, the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the two uncertainties.

So, Total ΔE = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt1) + ħ/(2Δt2)

But let me confirm that. If you have two energy levels, E1 and E2, each with an uncertainty ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the uncertainty in the energy difference ΔE = |E1 - E2| would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). Wait, no, actually if you have two independent variables, the uncertainty in their difference is the same as the uncertainty in their sum because it's sqrt(ΔE1^2 + ΔE2^2). But in terms of linewidths, I think the observed linewidth of a transition between two states is given by the sum of the natural linewidths of each state. Because the transition's linewidth is due to the finite lifetimes of both states involved. So, maybe the total linewidth Γ = Γ1 + Γ2, where Γ1 = 1/(2πτ1) and Γ2 = 1/(2πτ2). Wait, I might be confusing different definitions here.

Let me recall that the natural linewidth (Γ) is related to the lifetime (τ) by Γ = ħ / τ. But sometimes it's written as Γ = 1/(2πτ) depending on convention. Wait, hmm. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, so ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). Therefore, for each energy level, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2*10^-9 s) and ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (2*10^-8 s). Then maybe the uncertainty in the energy difference would be ΔE_total ≈ sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )? Because the uncertainties are independent.

But actually, the frequency linewidth is often stated in terms of full width at half maximum (FWHM), which for a Lorentzian line shape is Γ = ħ / τ. Alternatively, the relation could be Γ = 1/(π τ) when considering radiative broadening. Wait, different sources may use different conventions here. Let's be careful. Let's check out the precise relation.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle: the energy-time uncertainty is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2.

If the lifetime of the state is τ, then Δt = τ, so ΔE ≥ ħ/(2τ). So, the minimum uncertainty in energy is ħ/(2τ). But I think in the context of spectral lines, the natural linewidth is usually given by Γ = ħ / τ. If τ is the mean lifetime, then Γ (the linewidth) is equal to ħ / τ. Therefore, Γ = ħ / τ.

But earlier, from HUP, Γ would be at least ħ/(2τ). Maybe different conventions here. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: The relation between the lifetime τ and the energy width Γ (as FWHM) is Γ = ħ / τ. For example, when you have exponential decay, the Fourier transform gives a Lorentzian line shape with FWHM of Γ = ħ/τ. Therefore, Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Then the total linewidth when considering a transition between these two states would be the sum of the two linewidths? That is Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).

But maybe it's the energy difference between the two levels and the uncertainty in that difference. If the energy difference is ΔE = |E1 - E2|, then the uncertainty in this energy difference would be Δ(ΔE) = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), but if the linewidth is additive, then actually Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2.

But in order to resolve two spectral lines, the energy difference should be greater than the linewidth. The Rayleigh criterion in spectroscopy says that two peaks are resolved if their separation is at least equal to their FWHM. But in quantum terms, if the energy difference between the two levels is much larger than their combined linewidths, then they can be clearly resolved. So, if the energy difference ΔE is greater than Γ_total, then they can be resolved. However, some sources might use the sum, others may use the quadrature sum.

Wait, so maybe let's confirm which one is correct.

Suppose each energy level has a linewidth Γ1 and Γ2. When you have a transition between them, the total linewidth would be Γ1 + Γ2. Because the photon emitted (or absorbed) has an uncertainty from both the upper and lower states. Therefore, to resolve two energy levels, the separation between them must be greater than the sum of their linewidths. So, energy difference ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.

Alternatively, if they’re right next to each other, like overlapping lines, then you can't d

"I have a quantum physics problem regarding two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, having lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. I need to determine what energy difference would allow these two energy levels to be clearly distinguished.

I recall that according to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, there's a relationship between a quantum state's lifetime and its energy uncertainty. The principle states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Sometimes this is simplified to approximately ħ. This means that a state's energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to its lifetime – shorter lifetimes correspond to larger energy uncertainties and broader spectral line widths.

To calculate the energy uncertainties, I need to use ΔE1 = ħ/(2*Δt1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2*Δt2), where Δt1 = 10^-9 seconds and Δt2 = 10^-8 seconds.

I'm trying to determine how to combine these uncertainties. When looking at the transition between two energy levels, I'm wondering if the total uncertainty would be the sum of individual uncertainties, or perhaps the square root of the sum of squares if they're independent.

For two independent variables with uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, the uncertainty in their difference would be sqrt((ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2). However, when considering spectral linewidths, I think the observed linewidth of a transition between two states might be the sum of each state's natural linewidths, since the transition's linewidth results from both states' finite lifetimes.

The natural linewidth (Γ) relates to lifetime (τ) by Γ = ħ/τ, though sometimes it's written as Γ = 1/(2πτ) depending on convention. Given this, Γ1 = ħ/τ1 and Γ2 = ħ/τ2, and the total linewidth for a transition between these states might be Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2).

According to the Rayleigh criterion in spectroscopy, two peaks are resolved if their separation equals at least their FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum). In quantum terms, if the energy difference between two levels significantly exceeds their combined linewidths, they can be clearly resolved. So if the energy difference ΔE exceeds Γ_total, the levels should be distinguishable.

I'm still trying to confirm whether the total uncertainty should be calculated as a sum or as a quadrature sum of the individual uncertainties when determining if overlapping lines can be distinguished."

I have a challenge involving two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, with respective lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. I need to identify which energy difference would allow these two energy levels to be distinctly identified. While options aren't provided, I have to determine the method to arrive at the solution.

I recall that the lifetime of a quantum state is linked to the energy uncertainty, as per the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle suggests that the product of energy uncertainty (ΔE) and time uncertainty (Δt) is roughly the reduced Planck constant, or ħ. Hence, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ.

Upon checking, the formula is actually ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2, though for simplicity, it's often expressed as approximately ħ. This implies that energy uncertainty, or natural line width, is inversely related to a state’s lifespan; a shorter lifetime results in greater energy uncertainty, which equates to a broader spectrum line width. Energy levels with overlapping uncertainties cannot be distinguished, thus the energy difference should exceed the combined uncertainty.

To solve this, I first calculate energy uncertainties from their lifetimes: ΔE1 = ħ / (2*Δt1) and ΔE2 = ħ / (2*Δt2). With Δt1 as 10^-9 seconds and Δt2 as 10^-8 seconds, the total energy uncertainty when these states interact would presumably be the sum of their individual uncertainties.

Considering the uncertainty in two independent variables, the standard form would be the sum of their uncertainties. Hence, the energy difference ΔE = |E1 - E2| should be calculated by summing the individual energy uncertainties: Total ΔE = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt1) + ħ/(2Δt2).

Verifying this, if we account for two energy levels, E1 and E2, with uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2 respectively, it's generally thought that the uncertainty in their energy difference would align with the sum of the uncertainties, since the transition's total linewidth includes lifetimes from both states involved. So, the complete linewidth is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2, where Γ1 = 1/(2πτ1) and Γ2 = 1/(2πτ2).

Reviewing, the natural linewidth (Γ) relates to lifetime (τ) via Γ = ħ / τ, though it might be listed as Γ = 1/(2πτ) based on conventions. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, implies ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). Thus, for each level: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2*10^-9 s) and ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (2*10^-8 s). Calculating, you find ΔE_total ≈ sqrt((ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2), accounting for their independence.

Yet, typical frequency linewidths utilize full width at half maximum (FWHM), rendering it as Γ = ħ / τ; sometimes expressed as Γ = 1/(π τ) for radiative broadening, depending on source conventions. The theory holds: ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2.

For a state lifetime τ, Δt = τ, translating to ΔE ≥ ħ/(2τ), meaning minimum energy uncertainty is ħ/(2τ). In spectral line contexts, natural linewidth usually states Γ = ħ / τ—affirming Γ = ħ / τ for lifetime-based observations.

When considering an exponential decay model, its Fourier transform results in a Lorentzian profile, with FWHM as Γ = ħ/τ. Thusly, Γ1 = ħ / τ1; Γ2 = ħ / τ2; and for these states' transition, total linewidth could equal their sum: Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).

Ultimately, resolving spectral lines necessitates the energy difference surpassing linewidths. Rayleigh's spectroscopic criterion mandates resolvable peaks to have separation equalling or exceeding their FWHM. Consequently, a level's energy difference, ΔE, being larger than the combined linewidths enables differentiation. Therefore, energy difference ΔE must exceed Γ_total, although whether this calculation is a basic sum or a quadrature sum may vary by source.

Assuming two energy levels with linewidths Γ1 and Γ2, transitioning between them, totals to linewidth Γ1 + Γ2. Hence, to resolve energy levels, their energy separation should surpass their total linewidth sum.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.\n\nBut maybe easier to compute in terms of eV·s, since the energy difference probably is given in eV.\n\nSince 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 J. So, ħ in eV·s is 1.0545718 ×10^-34 J·s / 1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV ≈ 6.582 ×10^-16 eV·s.\n\nTherefore, ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-16 eV·s\n\nCalculating Γ1:\n\nΓ1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.582 ×10^-16 eV·s / 10^-9 s = 6.582 ×10^-7 eV\n\nSimilarly, Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 6.582 ×10^-16 eV·s / 10^-8 s = 6.582 ×10^-8 eV\n\nSo, Γ1 = ~6.58e-7 eV, Γ2 = ~6.58e-8 eV\n\nTherefore, the sum Γ1 + Γ2 = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV\n\nSo, in this case, the energy difference ΔE between the two levels should be greater than ~7.24e-7 eV to be resolvable.\n\nBut, wait, the problem is probably given possible energy differences in certain orders, so maybe 10^-6 eV, 10^-7 eV, 10^-8 eV, etc. Based on our calculation, the energy difference must be greater than approx 7.2e-7 eV, which is ~0.7 microelectronvolt. So, an energy difference of 1e-6 eV (1 microelectronvolt) would be sufficient, but 1e-7 eV (0.1 microelectronvolt) would be insufficient.\n\nAlternatively, if they apply a stricter criterion, like the linewidths needing to be narrower than the energy spacing. The key idea is that the energy difference must be larger than the broadening due to the uncertainty principle.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is supposed to be on the order of 1e-6 eV, as it\'s larger than the sum of the two linewidths (≈7e-7 eV).\n\nWait, the question says "clearly distinguish". From the numbers, the energy difference should be much larger than the linewidth. So even 1e-6 eV, which is 10^-6 eV, is only a bit larger than 7e-7 eV. In some contexts, being a factor of ~1.4 times larger may not be considered "clearly" resolved. Typically, people might use the Rayleigh criterion, which is a separation equal to the width. But maybe in physics, to clearly resolve, you might want an order of magnitude more.\n\nBut since the problem gives two lifetimes of different orders of magnitude. 10^-9 and 10^-8 seconds. The τ1 is shorter, so contributes a larger linewidth (6.58e-7 eV) and τ2 is longer, smaller linewidth (6.58e-8 eV). The main contribution to the sum is from the shorter lifetime. So in fact, the sum is about 7.2e-7 eV, so approx 0.72 microelectronvolt.\n\nTherefore, if the energy difference is 10^-6 eV (1 microelectronvolt), that\'s 1e-6 eV is larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So that\'s on the same order, but a bit bigger.\n\nIf the options were 10^-6, that would work, but I suppose there might be options like 10^-9 eV, which is way too small, or 1e-5 eV, which is 10 microelectronvolts, which is way bigger. Since the calculated sum is around 0.7 microelectronvolts, 1e-6 eV is 1 microelectronvolt, which is a bit larger, maybe barely acceptable. If one of the options is 1e-6 eV, then that would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference deltaE should be much larger than the sum of the natural linewidths. How much larger? Well, depending on convention. If a factor of 3 or 10 is needed. But perhaps the problem is expecting the knowledge that the minimum energy difference must be comparable to the linewidth. If the natural linewidth is negligible, then even a small energy difference can be resolved, but if the linewidths are wider, you need a larger energy difference.\n\nBut to "clearly distinguish", the energy difference must be much larger than the uncertainties. Since the total uncertainty in the energy difference is 7.2e-7 eV, an energy difference 10 times this would be 7.2e-6 eV. But maybe the options given are in values like 1e-4 eV, 1e-5 eV, etc. But without seeing the options, it\'s hard. But maybe let\'s see.\n\nAlternatively, how else to approach this? The uncertainty in energy can also be considered as the minimum possible error in measuring the energy. Therefore, the energy difference E2 - E1 must be greater than the combined uncertainties to be resolvable.\n\nWait, but let me think again about linewidths. When an atom is in an excited state with lifetime τ, the emitted photon\'s frequency has an uncertainty (linewidth) of Δf = 1/(2πτ). And the energy uncertainty is ΔE = hΔf = h/(2πτ) = ħ/(τ). Since h = 2πħ.\n\nTherefore, yes, the energy uncertainty (linewidth) is Γ = ħ/τ.\n\nTherefore, for each energy level, E1 and E2: Γ1 = ħ / τ1, Γ2 = ħ / τ2. So Γ1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 J ≈ 1.05e-25 J. Convert to eV: 1 J = 6.242e18 eV, so 1.05e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 6.55e-7 eV. Similarly, Γ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.05e-26 J = 6.55e-8 eV. Sum is approximately 6.55e-7 + 6.55e-8 ≈ 7.2e-7 eV. So, yes, same as before.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference needs to be larger than that sum. If an option is, say, 1e-6 eV, then since 1e-6 > 7.2e-7, you could resolve it, but with some margin. If the option is 1e-7 eV, 1e-7 < 1.7e-7; but wait, no, Γ1 is 6.5e-7, which is 0.65e-6. So 1e-7 eV is even smaller than Γ1.\n\nSo put another way:\n\nLifetime (τ) | Γ (eV)\n\n10^-9 s: Γ1 ≈ 6.5e-7 eV\n\n10^-8 s: Γ2 ≈ 6.5e-8 eV\n\nTotal Γ_total ≈ 7e-7 eV\n\nSo, any energy difference larger than 7e-7 eV would be okay. But depending on the options given, if one option is 1e-6 eV (10^-6 eV), that works.  And 1e-5 or 1e-4 would also work.\n\nBut let\'s suppose the options are multiple choice with various orders of magnitude. For example:\n\na) 10^-5 eV\n\nb) 10^-6 eV\n\nc) 10^-7 eV\n\nd) 10^-8 eV\n\ne) 10^-9 eV\n\nIn this case, the answer would have to be 10^-6 eV, which is 1e-6 eV, or maybe 10^-5 eV. Since 1e-6 is one order larger than 7e-7, about ~1.4 times. However, how much larger does it need to be? If it\'s the standard "resolved" in spectroscopy, as per Rayleigh criterion, the peaks need to be separated by at least the width of the peak. So if linewidth is 7e-7 eV, then energy difference of 7e-7 eV is the minimum. So technical answer is the energy difference must be >7e-7 eV to resolve. However, common options may be 1e-6, because units often jump by orders of magnitude. So in the case of multiple choice with order of magnitude options, 1e-6 is more likely expected than a 7e-7. For example, actual physical constants\' linewidths, maybe computed similarly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is missing some factors. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nGiven τ1 = 10^-9 s.\n\nCompute Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J s)/1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, τ2 =1e-8 s, so Γ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8= 1.0545e-26 J, which is 6.58e-8 eV.\n\nThus, sum = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV ~ 0.72 microeV.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference should be greater than said sum. If the given options where in the 1e-6 eV (1 microeV), it\'s an order of greater, so maybe acceptable.\n\nBut in experimental physics, a commonly recognized thing is the linewidth, and you need the energy difference to be greater than the linewidth. But since the uncertainty in this case is the sum of their linewidths.\n\nIf anyone replies that, based on Heisenberg\'s principle, the energy uncertainty for each state is about ħ / (2tau), then in total, the uncertainty in the transition energy is the sum of individual uncertainties, which would be (ħ/(2tau1) + ħ/(2tau1))?\n\nAlternatively,  total variance would be sum of variances? If that’s the approach, then uncertainty = sqrt( (ħ/(2 tau1))^2 + (ħ/(2 tau2))^2 )\n\nBut I think for Fourier transform-related broadening, the linewidth just add. If one state decays with lifetime tau1 and the other with tau2, then, in the transition, the observed linewidth is (1/tau1 + 1/tau2) multiplied by ħ. Because in the time domain, the decay is exponential for each state. Wait, time and frequency: when two states decay exponentially, the overall transition has a lineshape that is the convolution of the individual Lorentzians? But instead, the spontaneous emission rate from a state is Gamma = 1/tau, and assuming that the lower state has a much longer lifetime (like a ground state with effectively infinite lifetime, so negligible Gamma), then the linewidth is determined by the upper state. But in this problem, both states have finite lifetimes. So I think in such a case, the overall linewidth would be the sum of the reciprocals. Let’s check:\n\nHere\'s another approach. When you have a transition between two energy levels each with lifetimes tau1 and tau2, the total rate at which the system can leave the excited state is the sum of the rates. No, wait, the total decay rate from the upper state is Gamma = 1/tau1, and the decay rate from the lower state is Gamma\' = 1/tau2. However, if the lower state is, say, another excited state (not the ground state), then the linewidth of the transition would be the sum of the linewidths of the upper and lower states. Therefore, the photon emitted in the transition has an uncertainty from both the upper state\'s finite lifetime and the lower state\'s finite lifetime. So in total, the linewidth is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ/tau1 + ħ/tau2. So the linewidth is the sum of the two. Therefore, the energy difference needs to be larger than this Γ. Therefore, if Γ\'s sum is about 7e-7 eV, so make the energy difference at least something like >= 1e-6 eV.\n\nThus, among possible options, the answer should be an energy difference comparable to ~1e-6 eV. If the given options have such a value, that would be the answer.\n\nIn the absence of the actual options, I need to simply note that the energy difference needs to be at least the sum of the natural linewidths of the two states. Since the linewidths are approximately 6.58e-7 and 6.58e-8 eV, which add to about 7.2e-7 eV. So the energy difference needs to be greater than this. If the choices are order of magnitudes, 1e-6 is closest, or if given in specific unit.\n\nWait, summary: For clear resolution, Delta E > total linewidth = sum of individual linewidths.\n\nSo correct answer is option with energy difference greater than ca. 7.2e-7 eV, likely 1e-6 eV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{10^{-6} \\, \\text{eV}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743808217, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3472, prompt_tokens=1589, total_tokens=5061, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with energies \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) and lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds respectively, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy (\(\Delta E\)) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (\(\tau\)) of the state. 

The energy uncertainty for each state is given by:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} \quad \text{and} \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}
\]
where \(\hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}\).

Calculating the individual energy uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

The total energy uncertainty (sum of the uncertainties) is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, their energy difference \(\Delta E\) must be greater than this total uncertainty. The most appropriate energy difference that ensures clear resolution, considering typical multiple-choice options, is:

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}
\]

itinguish them. So, according to this, the answer would require the energy difference to be larger than Γ1 + Γ2.

Therefore, calculating Γ1 and Γ2:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1

Γ2 = ħ / τ2

So, Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2)

But let's calculate those numbers. So, given τ1 is 10^-9 seconds and τ2 is 10^-8 seconds.

First, we need to compute 1/τ1 + 1/τ2, then multiply by ħ.

But let's get some numerical values. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

But maybe easier to compute in terms of eV·s, since the energy difference probably is given in eV.

Since 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^-19 J. So, ħ in eV·s is 1.0545718 ×10^-34 J·s / 1.602 × 10^-19 J/eV ≈ 6.582 ×10^-16 eV·s.

Therefore, ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-16 eV·s

Calculating Γ1:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.582 ×10^-16 eV·s / 10^-9 s = 6.582 ×10^-7 eV

Similarly, Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 6.582 ×10^-16 eV·s / 10^-8 s = 6.582 ×10^-8 eV

So, Γ1 = ~6.58e-7 eV, Γ2 = ~6.58e-8 eV

Therefore, the sum Γ1 + Γ2 = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV

So, in this case, the energy difference ΔE between the two levels should be greater than ~7.24e-7 eV to be resolvable.

But, wait, the problem is probably given possible energy differences in certain orders, so maybe 10^-6 eV, 10^-7 eV, 10^-8 eV, etc. Based on our calculation, the energy difference must be greater than approx 7.2e-7 eV, which is ~0.7 microelectronvolt. So, an energy difference of 1e-6 eV (1 microelectronvolt) would be sufficient, but 1e-7 eV (0.1 microelectronvolt) would be insufficient.

Alternatively, if they apply a stricter criterion, like the linewidths needing to be narrower than the energy spacing. The key idea is that the energy difference must be larger than the broadening due to the uncertainty principle.

But perhaps the answer is supposed to be on the order of 1e-6 eV, as it's larger than the sum of the two linewidths (≈7e-7 eV).

Wait, the question says "clearly distinguish". From the numbers, the energy difference should be much larger than the linewidth. So even 1e-6 eV, which is 10^-6 eV, is only a bit larger than 7e-7 eV. In some contexts, being a factor of ~1.4 times larger may not be considered "clearly" resolved. Typically, people might use the Rayleigh criterion, which is a separation equal to the width. But maybe in physics, to clearly resolve, you might want an order of magnitude more.

But since the problem gives two lifetimes of different orders of magnitude. 10^-9 and 10^-8 seconds. The τ1 is shorter, so contributes a larger linewidth (6.58e-7 eV) and τ2 is longer, smaller linewidth (6.58e-8 eV). The main contribution to the sum is from the shorter lifetime. So in fact, the sum is about 7.2e-7 eV, so approx 0.72 microelectronvolt.

Therefore, if the energy difference is 10^-6 eV (1 microelectronvolt), that's 1e-6 eV is larger than 7.2e-7 eV. So that's on the same order, but a bit bigger.

If the options were 10^-6, that would work, but I suppose there might be options like 10^-9 eV, which is way too small, or 1e-5 eV, which is 10 microelectronvolts, which is way bigger. Since the calculated sum is around 0.7 microelectronvolts, 1e-6 eV is 1 microelectronvolt, which is a bit larger, maybe barely acceptable. If one of the options is 1e-6 eV, then that would be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference deltaE should be much larger than the sum of the natural linewidths. How much larger? Well, depending on convention. If a factor of 3 or 10 is needed. But perhaps the problem is expecting the knowledge that the minimum energy difference must be comparable to the linewidth. If the natural linewidth is negligible, then even a small energy difference can be resolved, but if the linewidths are wider, you need a larger energy difference.

But to "clearly distinguish", the energy difference must be much larger than the uncertainties. Since the total uncertainty in the energy difference is 7.2e-7 eV, an energy difference 10 times this would be 7.2e-6 eV. But maybe the options given are in values like 1e-4 eV, 1e-5 eV, etc. But without seeing the options, it's hard. But maybe let's see.

Alternatively, how else to approach this? The uncertainty in energy can also be considered as the minimum possible error in measuring the energy. Therefore, the energy difference E2 - E1 must be greater than the combined uncertainties to be resolvable.

Wait, but let me think again about linewidths. When an atom is in an excited state with lifetime τ, the emitted photon's frequency has an uncertainty (linewidth) of Δf = 1/(2πτ). And the energy uncertainty is ΔE = hΔf = h/(2πτ) = ħ/(τ). Since h = 2πħ.

Therefore, yes, the energy uncertainty (linewidth) is Γ = ħ/τ.

Therefore, for each energy level, E1 and E2: Γ1 = ħ / τ1, Γ2 = ħ / τ2. So Γ1 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 J ≈ 1.05e-25 J. Convert to eV: 1 J = 6.242e18 eV, so 1.05e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 6.55e-7 eV. Similarly, Γ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.05e-26 J = 6.55e-8 eV. Sum is approximately 6.55e-7 + 6.55e-8 ≈ 7.2e-7 eV. So, yes, same as before.

Therefore, the energy difference needs to be larger than that sum. If an option is, say, 1e-6 eV, then since 1e-6 > 7.2e-7, you could resolve it, but with some margin. If the option is 1e-7 eV, 1e-7 < 1.7e-7; but wait, no, Γ1 is 6.5e-7, which is 0.65e-6. So 1e-7 eV is even smaller than Γ1.

So put another way:

Lifetime (τ) | Γ (eV)

10^-9 s: Γ1 ≈ 6.5e-7 eV

10^-8 s: Γ2 ≈ 6.5e-8 eV

Total Γ_total ≈ 7e-7 eV

So, any energy difference larger than 7e-7 eV would be okay. But depending on the options given, if one option is 1e-6 eV (10^-6 eV), that works.  And 1e-5 or 1e-4 would also work.

But let's suppose the options are multiple choice with various orders of magnitude. For example:

a) 10^-5 eV

b) 10^-6 eV

c) 10^-7 eV

d) 10^-8 eV

e) 10^-9 eV

In this case, the answer would have to be 10^-6 eV, which is 1e-6 eV, or maybe 10^-5 eV. Since 1e-6 is one order larger than 7e-7, about ~1.4 times. However, how much larger does it need to be? If it's the standard "resolved" in spectroscopy, as per Rayleigh criterion, the peaks need to be separated by at least the width of the peak. So if linewidth is 7e-7 eV, then energy difference of 7e-7 eV is the minimum. So technical answer is the energy difference must be >7e-7 eV to resolve. However, common options may be 1e-6, because units often jump by orders of magnitude. So in the case of multiple choice with order of magnitude options, 1e-6 is more likely expected than a 7e-7. For example, actual physical constants' linewidths, maybe computed similarly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is missing some factors. Let me check my calculations again.

Given τ1 = 10^-9 s.

Compute Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J s)/1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, τ2 =1e-8 s, so Γ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8= 1.0545e-26 J, which is 6.58e-8 eV.

Thus, sum = 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV ~ 0.72 microeV.

Therefore, the energy difference should be greater than said sum. If the given options where in the 1e-6 eV (1 microeV), it's an order of greater, so maybe acceptable.

But in experimental physics, a commonly recognized thing is the linewidth, and you need the energy difference to be greater than the linewidth. But since the uncertainty in this case is the sum of their linewidths.

If anyone replies that, based on Heisenberg's principle, the energy uncertainty for each state is about ħ / (2tau), then in total, the uncertainty in the transition energy is the sum of individual uncertainties, which would be (ħ/(2tau1) + ħ/(2tau1))?

Alternatively,  total variance would be sum of variances? If that’s the approach, then uncertainty = sqrt( (ħ/(2 tau1))^2 + (ħ/(2 tau2))^2 )

But I think for Fourier transform-related broadening, the linewidth just add. If one state decays with lifetime tau1 and the other with tau2, then, in the transition, the observed linewidth is (1/tau1 + 1/tau2) multiplied by ħ. Because in the time domain, the decay is exponential for each state. Wait, time and frequency: when two states decay exponentially, the overall transition has a lineshape that is the convolution of the individual Lorentzians? But instead, the spontaneous emission rate from a state is Gamma = 1/tau, and assuming that the lower state has a much longer lifetime (like a ground state with effectively infinite lifetime, so negligible Gamma), then the linewidth is determined by the upper state. But in this problem, both states have finite lifetimes. So I think in such a case, the overall linewidth would be the sum of the reciprocals. Let’s check:

Here's another approach. When you have a transition between two energy levels each with lifetimes tau1 and tau2, the total rate at which the system can leave the excited state is the sum of the rates. No, wait, the total decay rate from the upper state is Gamma = 1/tau1, and the decay rate from the lower state is Gamma' = 1/tau2. However, if the lower state is, say, another excited state (not the ground state), then the linewidth of the transition would be the sum of the linewidths of the upper and lower states. Therefore, the photon emitted in the transition has an uncertainty from both the upper state's finite lifetime and the lower state's finite lifetime. So in total, the linewidth is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ/tau1 + ħ/tau2. So the linewidth is the sum of the two. Therefore, the energy difference needs to be larger than this Γ. Therefore, if Γ's sum is about 7e-7 eV, so make the energy difference at least something like >= 1e-6 eV.

Thus, among possible options, the answer should be an energy difference comparable to ~1e-6 eV. If the given options have such a value, that would be the answer.

In the absence of the actual options, I need to simply note that the energy difference needs to be at least the sum of the natural linewidths of the two states. Since the linewidths are approximately 6.58e-7 and 6.58e-8 eV, which add to about 7.2e-7 eV. So the energy difference needs to be greater than this. If the choices are order of magnitudes, 1e-6 is closest, or if given in specific unit.

Wait, summary: For clear resolution, Delta E > total linewidth = sum of individual linewidths.

So correct answer is option with energy difference greater than ca. 7.2e-7 eV, likely 1e-6 eV.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}

Sometimes I have seen Γ = 1/(2πτ) with a decay rate Γ, leading to ΔE = ħ Γ, so ΔE = ħ/(2πτ).\n\nWait, if the lifetime τ is related to the decay rate Γ by τ = 1/Γ, then Γ = 1/τ, but when using the uncertainty principle, there\'s a factor of 2. Maybe distinction between different conventions here.\n\nAccording to some sources:\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle can be written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, where Δt is the characteristic lifetime. So the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) is ΔE = ħ/(Δt).\n\nBut sometimes, they use ΔE ≈ ħ/(2 Δt) when Δt is the standard deviation in time. Hmm, confusing. Let\'s try to clarify.\n\nStandard Heisenberg Uncertainty: σ_E * σ_t ≥ ħ/2, where σ_E and σ_t are the standard deviations. If we take σ_t as the lifetime τ (assuming exponential decay), then Γ (the FWHM in energy) would be related to σ_E.\n\nBut actually, for a purely exponential decay (which leads to a Lorentzian line shape), the FWHM in energy Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ/τ. Because Γ = 1/τ when converted into angular frequency units, and since E = ħω, Γ_E = ħΓ_ω = ħ*(1/τ). But perhaps it varies by a factor of 2 depending on definition.\n\nAlternatively, using Γ (FWHM) equals to 2 ħ / τ, depending on convention.\n\nWait, maybe I should look this up. If P(t) is the probability that the state remains undecayed, for an exponential decay P(t) ~ e^{-Γ t}, where Γ is the decay rate (dimension 1/s). Then the Fourier transform into energy gives a Lorentzian line shape with FWHM of Γ_energy = ħ Γ = ħ / τ, because τ is the mean lifetime (tau = 1/Γ). So ΔE (FWHM) = ħ / τ.\n\nBut in some notations, the uncertainty in energy is Γ, so Γ = ΔE = ħ /τ. So if the lifetime is τ, then the energy uncertainty is ħ / τ. Thus, if each state\'s energy has an uncertainty ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ / τ2, then the total uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states is ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).\n\nSince the linewidths are added when considering the transition between two states. Therefore, the minimum energy difference to resolve the lines would be on the order of ΔE_total.\n\nAlternatively, the transition linewidth between the two states would be determined by sum of their individual linewidths.\n\nThus, to clearly resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties.\n\nSo the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| must satisfy ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2). But I need to be careful. The \'clearly resolved\' condition might be according to the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two lines are just resolvable if their separation is equal to their FWHM. If their separation is much larger than their linewidths, then they can be clearly resolved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if the energy difference is greater than the sum of their linewidths.\n\nGiven conflicting thoughts, let\'s check references through reasoning.\n\nIf state 1 has linewidth ΔE1 and state 2 has linewidth ΔE2, when their energies E1 and E2 are separated by more than the combined uncertainty, then their spectral lines will not overlap and can be resolved. Therefore, the linewidth of each energy level contributes to the broadening of the spectral line when transitioning from one to another.\n\nSo the combined linewidth of the transition between states 1 and 2 would be Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Then the energy difference ΔE between the two levels must be greater than Γ_total in order for the lines not to overlap.\n\nBut Rayleigh criterion has a factor of about 1 for two lines of equal width to be overlapping. So perhaps the separation should be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2 or something. Wait, confusion arises here.\n\nLet’s think classically. If two spectral lines each have Lorentzian shapes centered at E1 and E2 with FWHM Γ1 and Γ2 respectively, if |E1 - E2| > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2, then the peaks are considered resolved. Otherwise, they start to merge. That could be the case. However, the exact criteria might depend on convention.\n\nBut considering that natural linewidths - if the two transitions have an energy separation larger than their combined FWHM, which is Γ1 + Γ2 as energy width, then we can consider the transitions as resolved. Alternatively, some sources may take a geometric mean, but given the lifetimes here differ by an order of magnitude, perhaps their sum is needed.\n\nSo stepping through calculations:\n\nLet’s compute Γ1 and Γ2.\n\nTaking Γ1 = ħ / τ1,\n\nΓ2 = ħ / τ2,\n\nwith τ1 = 10^-9 s, τ2 = 10^-8 s.\n\nIf the natural linewidth in energy is ħ / τ, thus Γ1 = 1.0545718e-34 J⋅s / 1e-9 s ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nSimilarly, Γ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.\n\nSo Γ1 is 1.05e-25 J, Γ2 is 1.05e-26 J.\n\nTotal linewidth (if added):\n\nΓ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 1.05e-25 + 1.05e-26 ≈ 1.155e-25 J.\n\nBut the problem is to have the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 such that they can be clearly resolved. Therefore, if the actual energy difference ΔE is much greater than Γ_total, then the two lines won’t overlap. To clearly resolve them, ΔE should be larger than Γ_total.\n\nAlternatively, according to the Rayleigh criterion for resolution, two peaks are considered resolved when the separation is equal to the FWHM (if they have the same width). But in this case, each peak may have different FWHM. Hence, the precise formula may differ. For two Lorentzians of different widths, the required separation is roughly their averaged FWHM. But this can vary.\n\nPerhaps to be more safe, if the energy difference between the states is less than their natural linewidths (distance of peaks < linewidths), they are not resolvable. Thus, the criterion to resolve them would be ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2? Or is it the sum?\n\nBut regardless, the options given probably involve this Γ_total, so sum or product.\n\nBut let\'s work with the formula:\n\nk is inversely proportional to lifetime, so Γ1 = (ħ) / τ1, Γ2 = (ħ) / τ2.\n\nSum of Γ1 and Γ2 would be ħ(1/τ1 +1/τ2).\n\nSo for τ1 =1e-9, tau2 =1e-8, 1/tau1=1e9, 1/tau2=1e8. So sum is 1e9 + 1e8=1.1e9 per second.\n\nSo Γ_total= ħ * 1.1e9 ≈1.0e-25 J.\n\nThus ħ is approximately 1e-34 J*s. Multiply by 1e9 per second, get 1e-25 J.\n\nConverting energy from Joules to eV: 1eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 1e-25 J is (1e-25 /1.6e-19) ≈6.25e-7 eV, or 0.625 µeV.\n\nSo told that Γ_total=Γ1 + Γ2 ≈≈0.6 µeV. Therefore, the energy splitting required must be greater than this for them to be resolved.\n\nLooking for the answer options here, which the user didn\'t supply, but the options are labeled in the initial problem. Wait, no, in original question, user says "Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?"\n\nBut since it\'s an unprovided multiple choice, we can maybe check what approximate order of magnitude is needed. But since our calculation produces required ΔE ≈0.6 µeV.\n\nBut the possible options might be in the order of 1e-6 eV (microelectron volts). However, perhaps in some other unit, but most realistic answers would likely be in µeV, meV, or so.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is numerically compute the value:\n\nCompute Γ_total = h /(2 pi) (1/(2 τ1) + 1/(2 τ2)).\n\nWait, if using the Heisenberg Uncertainty relation with a factor of 1/2.\n\nWait the Exact formula:\n\nAccording to uncertainty principle in energy-time.\n\nFor a state with lifetime τ (average time), the energy uncertainty is on the order of\n\nΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\nBut precise coefficient? The usual Heisenberg uncertainty is:\n\nσ_E σ_t ≥ ħ/2.\n\nHere for exponential decay, σ_t ≈ lifetime τ, then σ_E ≈ ħ/(2 τ), so the FWHM is related to σ_E multiplied by a factor (for Lorentzian distribution, the FWHM is 2σ_ω (in angular frequency), but for energy, FWHM Γ = 2σ_E.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of lifetime:\n\nΓ = ħ/τ\n\nBut should check.\n\nBut for purposes of calculation, the question might just need us to take ΔE ~ ħ / τ, adding both uncertainties, and taking it so that the energy difference between the levels must be greater than that sum.\n\nNow, time for actual calculation:\n\nComputing ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J\n\nΔE2 = ħ/τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 /1e-8 =1.0545718e-26 J\n\nSum ΔE_total ≈ 1.16e-25 J.\n\nConvert Joules to eV:\n\n1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J\n\nSo 1.16e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈7.24e-7 eV ≈0.724 µeV.\n\nTherefore, their energy difference should be greater than about 0.72 µeV. If given multiple choices, the answer would be such an option. Common choices in such problems are of order of magnitude calculations. If computed as ~1e-6 eV, the answer could be ~1 µeV or similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are giving factors, but since the calculation comes up with about ~0.7 µeV, the answer should be above this number. But since options are not provided, but given the original question asks for which option "could be" the energy difference, the possible well-resolved energy would be greater than this natural linewidth.\n\nAssuming the possible options are choices like 1e-3 eV, 1e-5 eV, 1e-6 eV, 1e-7 eV.\n\nSince we get 0.7 µeV=7e-7 eV. Therefore, the appropriate answer is likely about 1e-6 eV = 1 µeV. But depends on if 0.7 is close to that.\n\nBut in exam questions, even if an option is near that.\n\nBut given typical textbooks examples:\n\nIf we use the standard example, the natural linewidth is on the order of ΔE = ħ/τ. For τ = 1ns (1e-9 s:\n\nΔE = (1e-34 J·s)/(1e-9 s) = 1e-25 J, which is ~6e-7 eV ≈0.6 µeV as earlier. For τ=10 ns (1e-8 s), it drops by 10, so ΔE=0.06 µeV.\n\nIf them\'s energy difference must be at least sum of these (0.6 +0.06)=0.66 µeV.\n\nThus the minimum value is ~0.7 µeV. Therefore, any energy difference significantly larger than that (like 1 or 10 µeV) would do. So the possible given options would be say 1e-6 eV. Just need to check.\n\nAlternately, perhaps instructors would go with the mean or some other formula.\n\nWait another thought: if the states have energy uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the energy difference would have uncertainty sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) if the uncertainties are independent. Therefore, if states have energies E1 and E2 with variances ΔE1 and ΔE2, the variance of E2-E1 is Var(E2) + Var(E1), so standard deviation sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). Then the energy difference must be several times that standard deviation to be resolvable.\n\nThus, if applying that approach: using quadrature sum.\n\nΔE_spread = sqrt( (ħ/(2 τ1))² + (ħ/(2 τ2))² ). Then require the energy difference |E2 -E1| > ΔE_spread.\n\nBut let\'s compute that.\n\nTaking HUP ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i):\n\nThen, ΔE1 = 1.05e-34 / (2*1e-9 ) ≈5.27e-26 J\n\nΔE2=1.05e-34/(2e-8 )≈5.27e-27 J.\n\nQuadrature sum ΔE_combined = sqrt( (5.27e-26)^2 + (5.27e-27)^2 )≈ sqrt( 2.78e-51 + 2.78e-54 )≈sqrt(2.8e-51)≈5.27e-26 J.\n\nConvert to eV:\n\n5.27e-26 /1.6e-19 ≈3.3e-7 eV = 0.33 µeV.\n\nComparing to previous sum of ΔE =0.72 µeV, this is lower.\n\nThus depending on whether you take quadrature sum or linear sum, the required energy difference.\n\nBut it\'s unclear what the exact approach the problem expects. Since ΔE1 + ΔE2 is maximum uncertainty, and quadrature sum is classic for independent errors.\n\nHowever, in the context of quantum states and spectroscopic linewidths, I think adding the linewidths is more appropriate because transition linewidths sum when the upper and lower states have finite lifetimes.\n\nSo transitions linewidth coming from upper state decaying with τ1, and lower state with τ2. The combined effect would result in a transition linewidth Γ = Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, the natural linewidth is sum.\n\nBut referring to that scenario. Let check another approach: spacing vs linewidth.\n\nIn spectroscopy, if two energy levels both have finite lifetimes, the width of their transition line will be the sum of the individual linewidths. For example, via [1]: "The finite lifetime of excited states leads to broadening of spectral lines. For a transition between two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the natural linewidth is determined by the sum of the reciprocals of the lifetimes," which gives Γ = (1/τ1 +1/τ2)ħ/2.\n\nWait different again. So there\'s confusion here. Let\'s check a textbook.\n\nAccording to "Principles of Quantum Mechanics" by Shankar, the natural linewidth Γ comes from the radiative decay of the excited state, and since the ground state is stable, but linewidth is determined by the excited state\'s lifetime.\n\nBut in the current problem, both states have lifetimes. If both upper and lower states in a transition have finite lifetimes, how is the linewidth computed? For example, if we have emission from state 2 to state 1.\n\nIf state 2 has lifetime τ2, and state 1 has lifetime τ1. When emitting a photon, the transition linewidth would typically only depend on the sum of the lifetimes of the upper and lower states.\n\nAlternatively, when considering the decay of the excited state, the lower state\'s lifetime would contribute if it\'s not instantaneous. Wait, lower levels are typically ground states with effectively infinite lifetime, so their contribution can be neglected. If both are excited states, then the linewidth would indeed be the sum.\n\nAgreeing with a natural linewidth given by Γ = Γ_upper + Γ_lower where Γ_upper = ħ / τ_upper, Γ_lower = ħ / τ_lower.\n\nIn that scenario, indeed, Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = (ħ /τ1) + (ħ /τ2).\n\nThus, if the energy states E1 and E2 are separated by ΔE, in order to resolve their energies their separation must be much larger than Γ_total. So ΔE >> Γ_total. If question specifies "clearly resolved," then ΔE order of magnitude larger than Γ_total is expected, but the answer may look for ΔE being comparable to Γ_total or greater.\n\nBut, if according to some sources, the Rayleigh criterion requires that the difference in energy to be at least the sum of their linewidths. So it would need ΔE ≥ Γ1 + Γ2. Thus energy difference greater than this sum.\n\nCompute the numerical value of Γ1 + Γ2 in eV.\n\nΓ1 = ħ/τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) and lifetimes \( 10^{-9} \) seconds and \( 10^{-8} \) seconds respectively, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

For the first state with lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \) seconds:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \) seconds:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

The total linewidth (sum of the individual linewidths) is:
\[
\Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} + 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \approx 1.16 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
\]

Converting this energy to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Gamma_{\text{total}} \approx \frac{1.16 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \approx 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}
\]

To clearly resolve the energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between the two states must be significantly larger than this total linewidth. A suitable energy difference that could be clearly resolved is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \) (1 microelectronvolt).

\[
\boxed{1 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}}
\]

"I need to double-check the formulas for natural linewidth. Sometimes I have seen Γ = 1/(2πτ) with a decay rate Γ, leading to ΔE = ħ Γ, so ΔE = ħ/(2πτ).

Wait, if the lifetime τ is related to the decay rate Γ by τ = 1/Γ, then Γ = 1/τ, but when using the uncertainty principle, there's a factor of 2. Maybe distinction between different conventions here.

According to some sources:

The energy-time uncertainty principle can be written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, where Δt is the characteristic lifetime. So the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) is ΔE = ħ/(Δt).

But sometimes, they use ΔE ≈ ħ/(2 Δt) when Δt is the standard deviation in time. Hmm, confusing. Let's try to clarify.

Standard Heisenberg Uncertainty: σ_E * σ_t ≥ ħ/2, where σ_E and σ_t are the standard deviations. If we take σ_t as the lifetime τ (assuming exponential decay), then Γ (the FWHM in energy) would be related to σ_E.

But actually, for a purely exponential decay (which leads to a Lorentzian line shape), the FWHM in energy Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ/τ. Because Γ = 1/τ when converted into angular frequency units, and since E = ħω, Γ_E = ħΓ_ω = ħ*(1/τ). But perhaps it varies by a factor of 2 depending on definition.

Alternatively, using Γ (FWHM) equals to 2 ħ / τ, depending on convention.

Wait, maybe I should look this up. If P(t) is the probability that the state remains undecayed, for an exponential decay P(t) ~ e^{-Γ t}, where Γ is the decay rate (dimension 1/s). Then the Fourier transform into energy gives a Lorentzian line shape with FWHM of Γ_energy = ħ Γ = ħ / τ, because τ is the mean lifetime (tau = 1/Γ). So ΔE (FWHM) = ħ / τ.

But in some notations, the uncertainty in energy is Γ, so Γ = ΔE = ħ /τ. So if the lifetime is τ, then the energy uncertainty is ħ / τ. Thus, if each state's energy has an uncertainty ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 and ΔE2 = ħ / τ2, then the total uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states is ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2).

Since the linewidths are added when considering the transition between two states. Therefore, the minimum energy difference to resolve the lines would be on the order of ΔE_total.

Alternatively, the transition linewidth between the two states would be determined by sum of their individual linewidths.

Thus, to clearly resolve them, the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

So the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| must satisfy ΔE > (ΔE1 + ΔE2). But I need to be careful. The 'clearly resolved' condition might be according to the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two lines are just resolvable if their separation is equal to their FWHM. If their separation is much larger than their linewidths, then they can be clearly resolved.

Alternatively, perhaps if the energy difference is greater than the sum of their linewidths.

Given conflicting thoughts, let's check references through reasoning.

If state 1 has linewidth ΔE1 and state 2 has linewidth ΔE2, when their energies E1 and E2 are separated by more than the combined uncertainty, then their spectral lines will not overlap and can be resolved. Therefore, the linewidth of each energy level contributes to the broadening of the spectral line when transitioning from one to another.

So the combined linewidth of the transition between states 1 and 2 would be Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ (1/τ1 + 1/τ2). Then the energy difference ΔE between the two levels must be greater than Γ_total in order for the lines not to overlap.

But Rayleigh criterion has a factor of about 1 for two lines of equal width to be overlapping. So perhaps the separation should be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2 or something. Wait, confusion arises here.

Let’s think classically. If two spectral lines each have Lorentzian shapes centered at E1 and E2 with FWHM Γ1 and Γ2 respectively, if |E1 - E2| > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2, then the peaks are considered resolved. Otherwise, they start to merge. That could be the case. However, the exact criteria might depend on convention.

But considering that natural linewidths - if the two transitions have an energy separation larger than their combined FWHM, which is Γ1 + Γ2 as energy width, then we can consider the transitions as resolved. Alternatively, some sources may take a geometric mean, but given the lifetimes here differ by an order of magnitude, perhaps their sum is needed.

So stepping through calculations:

Let’s compute Γ1 and Γ2.

Taking Γ1 = ħ / τ1,

Γ2 = ħ / τ2,

with τ1 = 10^-9 s, τ2 = 10^-8 s.

If the natural linewidth in energy is ħ / τ, thus Γ1 = 1.0545718e-34 J⋅s / 1e-9 s ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J.

Similarly, Γ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.

So Γ1 is 1.05e-25 J, Γ2 is 1.05e-26 J.

Total linewidth (if added):

Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 1.05e-25 + 1.05e-26 ≈ 1.155e-25 J.

But the problem is to have the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 such that they can be clearly resolved. Therefore, if the actual energy difference ΔE is much greater than Γ_total, then the two lines won’t overlap. To clearly resolve them, ΔE should be larger than Γ_total.

Alternatively, according to the Rayleigh criterion for resolution, two peaks are considered resolved when the separation is equal to the FWHM (if they have the same width). But in this case, each peak may have different FWHM. Hence, the precise formula may differ. For two Lorentzians of different widths, the required separation is roughly their averaged FWHM. But this can vary.

Perhaps to be more safe, if the energy difference between the states is less than their natural linewidths (distance of peaks < linewidths), they are not resolvable. Thus, the criterion to resolve them would be ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2? Or is it the sum?

But regardless, the options given probably involve this Γ_total, so sum or product.

But let's work with the formula:

k is inversely proportional to lifetime, so Γ1 = (ħ) / τ1, Γ2 = (ħ) / τ2.

Sum of Γ1 and Γ2 would be ħ(1/τ1 +1/τ2).

So for τ1 =1e-9, tau2 =1e-8, 1/tau1=1e9, 1/tau2=1e8. So sum is 1e9 + 1e8=1.1e9 per second.

So Γ_total= ħ * 1.1e9 ≈1.0e-25 J.

Thus ħ is approximately 1e-34 J*s. Multiply by 1e9 per second, get 1e-25 J.

Converting energy from Joules to eV: 1eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 1e-25 J is (1e-25 /1.6e-19) ≈6.25e-7 eV, or 0.625 µeV.

So told that Γ_total=Γ1 + Γ2 ≈≈0.6 µeV. Therefore, the energy splitting required must be greater than this for them to be resolved.

Looking for the answer options here, which the user didn't supply, but the options are labeled in the initial problem. Wait, no, in original question, user says "Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?"

But since it's an unprovided multiple choice, we can maybe check what approximate order of magnitude is needed. But since our calculation produces required ΔE ≈0.6 µeV.

But the possible options might be in the order of 1e-6 eV (microelectron volts). However, perhaps in some other unit, but most realistic answers would likely be in µeV, meV, or so.

Alternatively, another approach is numerically compute the value:

Compute Γ_total = h /(2 pi) (1/(2 τ1) + 1/(2 τ2)).

Wait, if using the Heisenberg Uncertainty relation with a factor of 1/2.

Wait the Exact formula:

According to uncertainty principle in energy-time.

For a state with lifetime τ (average time), the energy uncertainty is on the order of

ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

But precise coefficient? The usual Heisenberg uncertainty is:

σ_E σ_t ≥ ħ/2.

Here for exponential decay, σ_t ≈ lifetime τ, then σ_E ≈ ħ/(2 τ), so the FWHM is related to σ_E multiplied by a factor (for Lorentzian distribution, the FWHM is 2σ_ω (in angular frequency), but for energy, FWHM Γ = 2σ_E.

Alternatively, in terms of lifetime:

Γ = ħ/τ

But should check.

But for purposes of calculation, the question might just need us to take ΔE ~ ħ / τ, adding both uncertainties, and taking it so that the energy difference between the levels must be greater than that sum.

Now, time for actual calculation:

Computing ΔE1 = ħ/τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J

ΔE2 = ħ/τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 /1e-8 =1.0545718e-26 J

Sum ΔE_total ≈ 1.16e-25 J.

Convert Joules to eV:

1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J

So 1.16e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈7.24e-7 eV ≈0.724 µeV.

Therefore, their energy difference should be greater than about 0.72 µeV. If given multiple choices, the answer would be such an option. Common choices in such problems are of order of magnitude calculations. If computed as ~1e-6 eV, the answer could be ~1 µeV or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are giving factors, but since the calculation comes up with about ~0.7 µeV, the answer should be above this number. But since options are not provided, but given the original question asks for which option "could be" the energy difference, the possible well-resolved energy would be greater than this natural linewidth.

Assuming the possible options are choices like 1e-3 eV, 1e-5 eV, 1e-6 eV, 1e-7 eV.

Since we get 0.7 µeV=7e-7 eV. Therefore, the appropriate answer is likely about 1e-6 eV = 1 µeV. But depends on if 0.7 is close to that.

But in exam questions, even if an option is near that.

But given typical textbooks examples:

If we use the standard example, the natural linewidth is on the order of ΔE = ħ/τ. For τ = 1ns (1e-9 s:

ΔE = (1e-34 J·s)/(1e-9 s) = 1e-25 J, which is ~6e-7 eV ≈0.6 µeV as earlier. For τ=10 ns (1e-8 s), it drops by 10, so ΔE=0.06 µeV.

If them's energy difference must be at least sum of these (0.6 +0.06)=0.66 µeV.

Thus the minimum value is ~0.7 µeV. Therefore, any energy difference significantly larger than that (like 1 or 10 µeV) would do. So the possible given options would be say 1e-6 eV. Just need to check.

Alternately, perhaps instructors would go with the mean or some other formula.

Wait another thought: if the states have energy uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the energy difference would have uncertainty sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) if the uncertainties are independent. Therefore, if states have energies E1 and E2 with variances ΔE1 and ΔE2, the variance of E2-E1 is Var(E2) + Var(E1), so standard deviation sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). Then the energy difference must be several times that standard deviation to be resolvable.

Thus, if applying that approach: using quadrature sum.

ΔE_spread = sqrt( (ħ/(2 τ1))² + (ħ/(2 τ2))² ). Then require the energy difference |E2 -E1| > ΔE_spread.

But let's compute that.

Taking HUP ΔE_i = ħ/(2 τ_i):

Then, ΔE1 = 1.05e-34 / (2*1e-9 ) ≈5.27e-26 J

ΔE2=1.05e-34/(2e-8 )≈5.27e-27 J.

Quadrature sum ΔE_combined = sqrt( (5.27e-26)^2 + (5.27e-27)^2 )≈ sqrt( 2.78e-51 + 2.78e-54 )≈sqrt(2.8e-51)≈5.27e-26 J.

Convert to eV:

5.27e-26 /1.6e-19 ≈3.3e-7 eV = 0.33 µeV.

Comparing to previous sum of ΔE =0.72 µeV, this is lower.

Thus depending on whether you take quadrature sum or linear sum, the required energy difference.

But it's unclear what the exact approach the problem expects. Since ΔE1 + ΔE2 is maximum uncertainty, and quadrature sum is classic for independent errors.

However, in the context of quantum states and spectroscopic linewidths, I think adding the linewidths is more appropriate because transition linewidths sum when the upper and lower states have finite lifetimes.

So transitions linewidth coming from upper state decaying with τ1, and lower state with τ2. The combined effect would result in a transition linewidth Γ = Γ1 + Γ2. Therefore, the natural linewidth is sum.

But referring to that scenario. Let check another approach: spacing vs linewidth.

In spectroscopy, if two energy levels both have finite lifetimes, the width of their transition line will be the sum of the individual linewidths. For example, via [1]: "The finite lifetime of excited states leads to broadening of spectral lines. For a transition between two states with lifetimes τ1 and τ2, the natural linewidth is determined by the sum of the reciprocals of the lifetimes," which gives Γ = (1/τ1 +1/τ2)ħ/2.

Wait different again. So there's confusion here. Let's check a textbook.

According to "Principles of Quantum Mechanics" by Shankar, the natural linewidth Γ comes from the radiative decay of the excited state, and since the ground state is stable, but linewidth is determined by the excited state's lifetime.

But in the current problem, both states have lifetimes. If both upper and lower states in a transition have finite lifetimes, how is the linewidth computed? For example, if we have emission from state 2 to state 1.

If state 2 has lifetime τ2, and state 1 has lifetime τ1. When emitting a photon, the transition linewidth would typically only depend on the sum of the lifetimes of the upper and lower states.

Alternatively, when considering the decay of the excited state, the lower state's lifetime would contribute if it's not instantaneous. Wait, lower levels are typically ground states with effectively infinite lifetime, so their contribution can be neglected. If both are excited states, then the linewidth would indeed be the sum.

Agreeing with a natural linewidth given by Γ = Γ_upper + Γ_lower where Γ_upper = ħ / τ_upper, Γ_lower = ħ / τ_lower.

In that scenario, indeed, Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = (ħ /τ1) + (ħ /τ2).

Thus, if the energy states E1 and E2 are separated by ΔE, in order to resolve their energies their separation must be much larger than Γ_total. So ΔE >> Γ_total. If question specifies "clearly resolved," then ΔE order of magnitude larger than Γ_total is expected, but the answer may look for ΔE being comparable to Γ_total or greater.

But, if according to some sources, the Rayleigh criterion requires that the difference in energy to be at least the sum of their linewidths. So it would need ΔE ≥ Γ1 + Γ2. Thus energy difference greater than this sum.

Compute the numerical value of Γ1 + Γ2 in eV.

Γ1 = ħ/τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J. To eV: 1.0545718e-25 /1.602e-19 ≈6.58e-7 eV ≈0.658 µeV.

Γ2 = ħ/τ2 = (1.0545718e-34) /1e-8 ≈1.0545718e-26 J ≈(1.0545718e-26 /1.602e-19 )=6.58e-8 eV ≈0.0658 µeV.

The sum is 0.658 +0.0658 ≈0.724 µeV.

So Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 ≈0.724 µeV. Thus, to clearly resolve the energy levels, the energy difference ΔE should be much larger than 0.724 μeV. About 1 μeV might be sufficient. But in an exam setting without options, one cannot precisely say—though most closer given QM typically relies on order-of-magnitude estimates.

Alternatively, looking at Planck time_eV ?

Wait - but user asks which option "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" So possible candidates are on the order of ≈1e-6 eV (μeV) So the correct answer should be 10^-6 eV.

But another choice could be 10eV which is way higher but possible. Unless other orders of magnitude. But given ≈0.7 μeV=~7e-7 eV. Thus, an answer of 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) would work.

Therefore, given possible options, the correct choice is around 1e-6 eV. So box this as the answer within text."

{I need to convert this conclusion into LaTeX's boxed notation. It should be ~0.7 μeV, but depending on option choices, if that's not present, 1 μeV is the closest.}

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least approximately \boxed{1 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}} to clearly resolve the two levels.

Thus, energy difference should be greater than this sum. But according to resolution criteria, like for resolution being possible when the wavelength difference is greater than the linewidth. Equivalent in energy terms: ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2).\nBut perhaps if you use the more precise formulation from high-resolution spectroscopy, the resolution condition is that the energy (or frequency) difference should be greater than the linewidth. If each energy level gives rise to a Lorentzian profile with FWHM Γ, then the convolution of the two lines would result in a total FWHM of Γ1 + Γ2. Then, to resolve, the separation Δν (frequency) should be greater than Γ1 + Γ2; energy is ΔE = h Δν.\n\nAlternatively, applying the Rayleigh criterion: two peaks can be resolved when their separation is equal to the FWHM of one peak.

Since the transition between two states, then the total energy uncertainty would be the sum of the uncertainties. Gaussian vs. Lorentzian? If assuming Gaussian (unlikely, since exponential decays yield Lorentzian, which have different convolution properties), but uncertainties add in quadrature. But because lifetime broadening is a Lorentzian, combining two Lorentzians with linewidths ΔE1 and ΔE2 results in a Lorentzian with FWHM ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.\n\nTherefore, maybe you add them directly.\n\nThus, total energy uncertainty is (ΔE1 + ΔE2) ∼5.272859e-26 +5.272859e-27 = 5.8e-26 J.

So, in order to resolve two peaks with FWHM of Γ1 and Γ2 separated by ΔE, then, the required separation must be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2 for the Rayleigh criterion. Wait, no. Let’s recall Rayleigh\'s criterion states that two peaks are just resolved when the center of one peak is over the first minimum of the other. But for Gaussian profiles, the required separation is equal to the standard deviation. For Lorentzian profiles, however, the minimum is ill-defined as Lorentzian has broader tails.\n\nHowever, practical resolution considerations often approximate: the separation between peaks should be greater than the sum of their FWHM.\n\nAlternatively, equal absolute requirement: ΔE > max(Γ1, Γ2). But when Γ1 is ten times that of Γ2 (since Γ1 is ħ/(1e-9) and Γ2 is ħ/(1e-8)), which ratio exactly?

Specifically Γ (Hz)= 1/(2π τ). So Γ1 frequency FWHM is (2π τ1)^-1 = 1/(2π *1e-9) ≈ 159 MHz, Γ2 is ~1/(2π *1e-8) ≈15.9 MHz. Total linewidth adding, Γ ≈159+15.9 ≈175 MHz.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of a state. The energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \).

For the first state with a lifetime \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the second state with a lifetime \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

The total energy uncertainty (linewidth) when considering both states is the sum of their individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than this total uncertainty. Converting the total uncertainty to a more standard unit:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy difference should be at least approximately \(1 \, \mu\text{eV}\). The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}
\]

 Simplified as: |E2 - E1| > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2.

Hence, key steps:

1. Find ΔE1 and ΔE2 from τ1 and τ2 using ΔE = ħ / τ.
Or to use Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2 where Γ is the linewidth.

The total linewidth of transition is Γ1 + Γ2, assuming homogeneous broadening. Thus, energy difference should be greater than this sum. But according to resolution criteria, like for resolution being possible when the wavelength difference is greater than the linewidth. Equivalent in energy terms: ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2).
But perhaps if you use the more precise formulation from high-resolution spectroscopy, the resolution condition is that the energy (or frequency) difference should be greater than the linewidth. If each energy level gives rise to a Lorentzian profile with FWHM Γ, then the convolution of the two lines would result in a total FWHM of Γ1 + Γ2. Then, to resolve, the separation Δν (frequency) should be greater than Γ1 + Γ2; energy is ΔE = h Δν.

Alternatively, applying the Rayleigh criterion: two peaks can be resolved when their separation is equal to the FWHM of one peak. But the exact condition may vary. Here, as each energy level contributes to the linewidth, so combining their linewidths gives the actual overall linewidth. Thus, ΔE should be larger than Γ1 + Γ2.

But first, let's crunch numbers.

First, compute Γ1 and Γ2, using Γ = ħ / τ.

Given τ1 = 1e-9 s, τ2 = 1e-8 s.

Calculate Γ1 = ħ / τ1; ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Γ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/ (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Similarly, Γ2 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) = 1.0545718e-26 J.

So, Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.159e-25 J.

Now, to get energy difference ΔE required to resolve them, it must be greater than Γ1 + Γ2.

Alternatively, I can use a different linewidth formula. If using ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt), then:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) = 1.0545718e-34 / (2 * 1e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2*Δt2) = 1.0545718e-34 / (2*1e-8) = 5.272859e-27 J.

Total uncertainty added in quadrature due to lifetime of each state: as each energy has uncertainty from initial and final states. Since the transition between two states, then the total energy uncertainty would be the sum of the uncertainties. Gaussian vs. Lorentzian? If assuming Gaussian (unlikely, since exponential decays yield Lorentzian, which have different convolution properties), but uncertainties add in quadrature. But because lifetime broadening is a Lorentzian, combining two Lorentzians with linewidths ΔE1 and ΔE2 results in a Lorentzian with FWHM ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Therefore, maybe you add them directly.

Thus, total energy uncertainty is (ΔE1 + ΔE2) ∼5.272859e-26 +5.272859e-27 = 5.8e-26 J. But in this calculation, the overall linewidth is dependent on ΔE1 and ΔE2 summed.

Alternative approaches may exist.

Alternatively, time–energy uncertainty:

The time uncertainty is the minimum between τ1 and τ2, but that doesn't seem applicable here.

Alternatively, if you have overlapping Lorentzians, the combined linewidth is the sum. So, in order to resolve two peaks with FWHM of Γ1 and Γ2 separated by ΔE, then, the required separation must be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2 for the Rayleigh criterion. Wait, no. Let’s recall Rayleigh's criterion states that two peaks are just resolved when the center of one peak is over the first minimum of the other. But for Gaussian profiles, the required separation is equal to the standard deviation. For Lorentzian profiles, however, the minimum is ill-defined as Lorentzian has broader tails.

However, practical resolution considerations often approximate: the separation between peaks should be greater than the sum of their FWHM.

Alternatively, equal absolute requirement: ΔE > max(Γ1, Γ2). But when Γ1 is ten times that of Γ2 (since Γ1 is ħ/(1e-9) and Γ2 is ħ/(1e-8)), which ratio exactly? Compute exact values:

τ1 =1e-9 s; Γ1 rate is proportional to 1/τ1 =1e9 Hz.

τ2=1e-8 s; Γ2=1e8 Hz.

In frequency terms, ν = E/h, so energy difference is ΔE= h Δν.

The FWHM in frequency would be Γ1/(2π), Γ2/(2π). Specifically Γ (Hz)= 1/(2π τ). So Γ1 frequency FWHM is (2π τ1)^-1 = 1/(2π *1e-9) ≈ 159 MHz, Γ2 is ~1/(2π *1e-8) ≈15.9 MHz. Total linewidth adding, Γ ≈159+15.9 ≈175 MHz. To distinguish, energy separation must be greater than this.

Alternatively, Δν (required) > (Γ). So if transition linewidth is Γ_total =Γ1 + Γ2, then Δν > Γ_total.

But this is perhaps, since each state contributes.

Alternatively, consider that the energy levels have their own linewidth. So the transition linewidth is indeed Γ = Γ1 + Γ2. For absorption or emission between the two levels, the linewidth comes from both states. So if they want the energy levels themselves to be resolvable, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the combined linewidth.

But transitioning between them leads to a linewidth that spans Γ1 + Γ2. Hence, spectral lines must be separated more than Γ to be resolved.

But this is a bit confused. Need to focus.

For two energy levels with uncertaintie ΔE1 and ΔE2 (Heisenberg due to their lifetimes), the energy difference has uncertainty of sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )?

Wait, but these two uncertainties might be correlated. But if they’re independent, the quadrate sum is appropriate. But linewidths add for Lorentzians. Because two Lorentzian (homogeneous) broadenings convolution becomes another Lorentzian, with width Γ_total =Γ1 +Γ2.

So, to for a line transition between E1 and E2, the linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2.

Hence, according to the Rayleigh criterion, to resolve two such spectral lines, their energy separation needs to be larger than the linewidth. Thus, assertedΔE >Γ_total.

But typical Rayleigh in imaging (airy disks separation) for lines: Δν ≈ the linewidth. For Lorentzian lines (ah, but Lorentzians don’t have zero-crossing as Gaussians), but basically, sometimes an estimated resolvable difference is when the peaks are separated by their average linewidth. For distinguishing two Lorentzian peaks, I think a sufficient condition is that the separation should be more than the sum of their FWHMs.

Schroeder's "Spectroscopic Techniques" mentions that the resolution requires that two lines of equal intensity with a separation of their line centers greater than the sum of their half-widths can be considered resolved. (Schroeder).

Alternatively, as found in another reference. For two lines with FWHM of Γ1 and Γ2, so separated by Γ1 + Γ2, effectively merged.

Alternatively, the resolving power is R = ν / Δν, so perhaps in order to resolve two peaks, their separation needs to be on the order of R.

But in our case, maybe more straightforward: if the linewidths (FWHM) are already merging, then.

If the two energies’ separation is larger than the FWHM of their line, then different. Thus, maybe simply require ΔE > Γ_total, where Γ_total =Γ1 +Γ2.

In any case, perhaps for the problem (as designed for a multiple-choice task), the answer believes we simply sum the values. Then, Total linewidth is Γ1 + Γ2.

So converting the energy uncertainty from Γ = ħ / τ.

First compute Γ1, Γ2.

Given:

τ1=1e-9 s => Γ1 =ħ /τ1
τ2=1e-8 s =>Γ2=ħ /τ2

Total Γ = Γ1 +Γ2 = ħ (1/1e-9 +1/1e-8) = ħ (1e9 + 1e8 ) = ħ *1.1e9 ≈ ħ*1.1e9

Alternatively, taking into account that Γ is equal to FWHM, which owns energy spread. To resolve ΔE needs to be greater than Γ. SoΔE>Γ sum.

But maybe the question just asks for the energy uncertainty from each level via ΔE ≥ ħ/(2τ) for each and then sum ?

Alternatively,

Computing exact requirement? The energy precision required for distinction is that the natural linewidth (uncertainty) in energies must not overlap.

Hence,the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

So the uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2τ1) AND uncertainty in E2 isΔE2≈ ħ/(2τ2)

Thus, the total uncertainty δE =ΔE1 + ΔE2. Therefore, energy difference must exceed δE to resolve.

Therefore:

δE = (1e-34 J·s)/(2*1e-9 ) + (1e-34)/(2*1e-8 ) Simplify:

This gives:

(1e-34 /2 ) (1e9 +1e8 )

= (0.5e-34)*(1.1e9 )= 0.55e-25 J

Convert that to eV. Since 1eV=1.602e-19 J, soδE in eV= 0.55e-25 /1.602e-19 ≈3.43e-7 eV.

But electric? Perhaps, but options may suggest value like order of meV or µeV.

Alternatively, perhaps, look for the smallest energy where overlap is minimal.

Alternatively lower.

But the problem is saying "clearly distinguish". The natural linewidth would define the lower limit, so energy difference must be bigger than that sum.

Assuming the energy difference must be on order of 1e-25 J orsuch. Converting that to eV:

Since in Joules it's ~1.05e-25 J

 hmm, 1eV is 1.602e-19 J, so division here gives; for 1.05e-25 /1.6e-19 ~6.5e-7 eV.

So approximates to 0.65 µeV.

Therefore, an answer would presumably need ΔE> something like that order of magnitude (0.65 µeV). Without given options, but perhaps just state in base of δE=const ħ/ (minimum τ):

But alternatively, note your approach in the calculation.

Alternatively, some premised the energy time uncertainty as ΔE~ȟ/τ. Using just ħ, not the reduced Plånck!

Wait, for reactors i can check: ħ = h/(2π) ≈1.05e-34 J·s. h is 6.62e-34.

If using Γ = ħ/τ, which then indeed.

Alternatively, if he uses Γ = h/(2πτ), which is equivalent to Γ = ħ/τ.

Hence, in orders of ，the total doing that still going around 1e-7ish eV.

But since each choice includes an option, but the user doesn’t given you.

However, again, I reifying that just to figure it out.

But perhaps to phrase ħ has value about 6.58 ×10^-16 eVs.

 τ1=1e-9 s: Γ1=ħ/τ1=6.58e-16 eVs /1e-9 s=6.58e-7 eV.

 τ2=1e-8 s: Γ2=6.58e-16 eVs /1e-8 s=6.58e-8 eV.

 Thus, total Γ_total=Γ1 +Γ2=6.58e-7 +6.58e-8=7.238e-7 eV ≈0.7238 µeV.

 Therefore, Energy difference must be greater than approximately 0.72 µeV.

Then, in options, the answer with energy difference ~1 µeV or higher would be sufficient. If options do include 1e-6 eV (1 µeV), it would be correct.

Without specific options, but calculation points to this.

Thus, they can be clearly resolved if their energy difference is on the order of ~1 µeV. Hence, the answer should be the option closest to this value, likely 1 μeV or similar.

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least approximately \(1 \, \mu\text{eV}\). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}.
