To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we need to calculate the decay length corresponding to this probability. 

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)) and velocity (\(\beta\)):**
   - The energy of \( X^0 \) is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV.
   - \(\gamma = \frac{E}{m_X} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917\)
   - \(\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m_X}{E}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3.41}{27}\right)^2} \approx 0.992\)

2. **Calculate the average decay length (\( L_{\text{avg}} \)):**
   - Proper lifetime \(\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16}\) s.
   - Lab frame lifetime \(\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 \approx 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15}\) s.
   - \( L_{\text{avg}} = \gamma \beta c \tau_0 \approx 7.917 \times 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \)

3. **Determine the decay length for 30% observable decays:**
   - The probability of decay after distance \( L \) is \( \exp\left(-\frac{L}{L_{\text{avg}}}\right) \).
   - To observe at least 30% of the decays, \( \exp\left(-\frac{L}{L_{\text{avg}}}\right) \leq 0.7 \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = -L_{\text{avg}} \ln(0.7) \approx 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \times 1.20397 \approx 2.27 \, \mu\text{m} \).

Thus, the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \(\boxed{2.3 \ \mu\text{m}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of this particle X^0. The problem says the proper lifetime of X^0 is 8e-16 seconds, and the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. The mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. Hmm, let me start breaking this down.

First, in particle physics, when they talk about lifetime and observing decays, I remember that relativistic effects come into play because the particles are moving at high speeds. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, but in the lab frame (Bubble Chamber here), the lifetime would be dilated due to time dilation. So the actual lifetime we observe should be gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But then, the problem is about the resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Resolution usually refers to spatial resolution here, right? So we're probably talking about the distance the particle travels before decaying. If the detector can't resolve very short tracks, then even if the particle decays, we might not see it. Therefore, the minimum resolution would correspond to the average decay length that 30% of the particles would have.

Wait, the average decay length is given by the speed of the particle multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame. But how does the 30% factor into this? Maybe the probability that the particle decays within a certain distance. So, the number of decays observed is related to the exponential decay law. The survival probability is N/N0 = exp(-t/tau), so the decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/tau). But here, they want to observe at least 30% of the decays. So we need to set 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab) >= 0.3, which gives t = -tau_lab * ln(0.7). Then the distance would be velocity * t. So the minimum resolution must be less than or equal to this distance. Wait, but actually, to observe the decay, the decay must happen within a detectable distance. So if the decay length is longer than the resolution, we can observe it. Wait, no. If our detector has a spatial resolution of delta_x, then tracks longer than delta_x can be resolved. Therefore, the decay length has to be longer than delta_x to be detected. So we need the decay length to be at least delta_x such that a fraction of 30% of the decays occur beyond delta_x. Wait, no, because the number of decays occurring beyond a certain distance is less due to the exponential decay. Wait, hold on.

Alternatively, the decay probability as a function of distance. The decay length L = gamma * v * tau_0. Where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Then the probability that a particle decays before traveling a distance L is given by integrating the exponential distribution. So actually, the decay probability as a function of distance is similar to time, using the relation t = L / (v). So let me write that down.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau0. The decay occurs at a time t in the lab frame, so the distance traveled is v*t. The probability that the decay happens before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma*tau0)). Substituting t = L / v, so the probability is 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)). Therefore, if we want the probability to be at least 30%, we set 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) >= 0.3. Then L must be such that exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) <= 0.7, so -L/(gamma*v*tau0) <= ln(0.7), hence L >= -gamma*v*tau0*ln(0.7). Therefore, the decay length must be at least gamma*v*tau0*(-ln(0.7)) for 30% of the decays to occur past that point? Wait, no, that might not be.

Hold on, thinking again. Let me formalize. The number of particles remaining at time t is N(t) = N0 exp(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab = gamma*tau0. The number of particles that have decayed is N0 - N(t) = N0(1 - exp(-t/tau_lab)). The decay probability is (N0 - N(t))/N0 = 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab). So if we set 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab) = 0.3, that means 30% decay probability. If we solve for t, we get t = -tau_lab * ln(1 - 0.3) = -gamma tau0 ln(0.7). Then the corresponding distance L is v * t = -gamma v tau0 ln(0.7). But wait, this is the time it takes for 30% of the particles to decay. So the distance traveled by the particle in that time is the decay length needed such that 30% of the decays have occurred before L. Therefore, to observe 30% of the decays, you need your detector to be able to see decay lengths down to L. So the spatial resolution should be at least that L to resolve those decay vertices. Hence, minimum resolution required is L = gamma * v * tau0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Therefore, I need to compute gamma and v. The problem gives the energy of the X^0 particle, which is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV, so we can compute gamma and beta (v/c).

So first, gamma is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / m_x = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 27 / 3.41 ≈ let's calculate that.

3.41 times 7 is 23.87, then 3.41*7.9 ≈ 3.41*7 + 3.41*0.9 ≈ 23.87 + 3.069 ≈ 26.939, which is close to 27. So approx 7.9. Therefore, gamma ≈ 7.91... Let me do it more precisely. 3.41 * 7.9 = 3.41 * (8 - 0.1) = 27.28 - 0.341 = 26.939. So 27 GeV is 0.061 GeV more, so 0.061 /3.41 ≈ 0.01787. So total gamma is approx 7.9 + 0.01787 ≈ 7.918, approximately 7.92.

But let me use exact numbers. 3.41 γ = 27, γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute 27 / 3.41.

27 divided by 3.41: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 27 -23.87 =3.13. 3.13 /3.41≈0.917. So gamma ≈7.917. So 7.917. So γ = 7.917.

Then, beta can be found from gamma. gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.917)^2)).

Calculate 7.917 squared, which is approx. Let's see, 8^2 =64. So 7.917 squared is (8 -0.083)^2 = 64 - 2*8*0.083 + 0.083^2 ≈64 -1.328 +0.0069≈62.6789. So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/62.6789) = sqrt(1 -0.01596) = sqrt(0.98404) ≈0.992. Therefore, beta ≈0.992, so speed is 0.992c.

Alternatively, since gamma = E/mc² but here energy already in GeV, so actually, total energy E=gamma mc². Wait, of course, (since E=gamma m c^2) So the 27 GeV is 'gamma * m_x', with m_x in GeV/c². So yes, exactly, gamma = E / m_x = 27 / 3.41 ≈7.917. Then beta is as calculated above.

But let me verify beta properly.

Given E = gamma m_x c^2 and momentum p = gamma beta m_x c.

So beta can also be calculated via beta = pc / E. Yes. Alternatively, with E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_x c^2)^2, so (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_x c^2)^2. So pc = sqrt(E^2 - m_x^2 c^4)/c. But perhaps easier to use beta = sqrt(1 - (m_x / E)^2). Is that right? Let's see:

From E = gamma m c^2, so gamma = E/(m c^2). Then beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). Therefore, beta = sqrt(1 - (m_x^2 c^4)/E^2 ). Since m_x c^2 = 3.41 GeV, E is 27 GeV. So beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.01595) ≈sqrt(0.98405) ≈0.992, so same as before. Therefore beta ≈0.992. So v ≈0.992c. Therefore, beta gamma is, gamma is 7.917, so beta gamma=0.992 *7.917≈7.854.

So now, with that speed, the mean lifetime in lab is gamma tau0. Given tau0=8e-16 seconds.

Therefore, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau≈7.917 *8e-16 s=6.3336e-15 s.

Then, the mean decay length is v tau_lab=beta c gamma tau0. We have beta gamma= approx 7.854, so giving distance of 7.854 * c tau0.

But let me step-by-step, in case I mix it up.

Average decay length L_avg = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau0. Since tau_lab = gamma tau0. So average decay length is also beta c gamma tau0. Alternatively, it's gamma beta c tau0, same thing. So and so with the average.

But we need not the average, but rather such that 30% of the decays have occurred prior to that length. So perhaps use the exponential distribution.

The decay probability as a function of path length L is 1 - exp(-L / (gamma beta c tau0)).

Wait, similar to earlier. Wait, perhaps another way: In the lab, particles are moving with speed v. The decay time distribution is (1/(gamma tau0)) exp(-t/(gamma tau0)) dt. The decay length distribution is then (1/(gamma tau0)) exp(-L/(v gamma tau0)) * dL / v. Because dL = v dt, so dt = dL/v. Therefore, the distribution for decay lengths is (1/(gamma tau0 v)) exp(-L/(gamma tau0 v)) * dL. Therefore, the probability that the decay happens between L and L+dL is (1/(gamma tau0 v)) exp(-L/(gamma tau0 v)) dL.

Therefore, the total probability for decay lengths less than L is integral from 0 to L of (1/(gamma tau0 v)) exp(-L'/(gamma tau0 v)) dL' = 1 - exp(-L/(gamma tau0 v)).

Wait, then, if probability is 0.3 to have decay length less than L, which is 1 - exp(-L/(gamma tau0 v)).

Hmm. So 1 - exp(-L/(gamma tau0 v)) = 0.3. Therefore, solving for L: exp(-L/(gamma tau0 v)) = 0.7, hence L = -gamma tau0 v * ln(0.7). So in front I have gamma tau0 v, which in terms of beta c:

Wait, c is speed of light, so v = beta c. So gamma tau0 v= gamma tau0 beta c.

But wait, also note that average decay length is in principle L_avg = gamma beta c tau0.

Therefore, average decay length is gamma beta c tau0, and L for 30% decay probability is -gamma beta c tau0 ln(0.7). Let me compute that.

First, compute gamma beta c tau0. Let me use exact values:

gamma ≈27/3.41≈7.917.

beta ≈0.992 (from earlier calculation).

c≈3e8 m/s. But need to convert units here. The tau0 is given in seconds.

First, c is 3e8 meters per second. So gamma beta c tau0 = 7.917 *0.992*3e8 m/s*8e-16 s.

But let's compute this product:

First 7.917 *0.992 ≈ approx 7.85 (from earlier beta gamma was 7.854).

So 7.85 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Let me compute the units:

Multiply 7.85 *3e8 (m/s) *8e-16 seconds:

The s in the denominator and numerator will cancel: 7.85 *3e8 *8e-16 m = 7.85 *24e-8 m = 7.85 * 2.4e-7 m = 18.84e-7 m =1.884e-6 meters, which is 1.884 micrometers.

But wait, more precisely:

7.85 * 3e8 =23.55e8, times 8e-16 is 23.55e8 * 8e-16 = 188.4e-8 = 1.884e-6 meters. So 1.884 micrometers. That's the average decay length.

But we need not the average but the length L such that L = -gamma beta c tau0 *ln(0.7). Recall that if average length L_avg = gamma beta c tau0, then L for 30% is -gamma beta c tau0 *ln(0.7). Let me compute that.

First, compute ln(0.7). Natural logarithm of 0.7 is approximately -0.35667.

Therefore, ln(0.7)= -0.35667. So multiply L_avg by (-ln(0.7)). So L= L_avg * 0.35667. So 1.884 micrometers *0.35667≈ 0.6719 micrometers. So approximately 672 nanometers.

Therefore, the minimum resolution required is approximately 672 nm.

But perhaps I'll use more precise values.

Wait first check my steps again:

Confusion might be if the decay probability or which length.

Given you want to detect at least 30% of the decays, which corresponds to 30% of the decay lengths must be longer than the resolution. Wait, because if the decay occurs with a path length greater than the detector resolution, then you can detect it. So, to observe the decay products, the particle must decay after traveling a distance such that the decay vertex is separated from the production vertex by that distance, so the detector has to have a resolution better than that distance. So, more precise: If your spatial resolution is delta_x, then any decay happening within delta_x can't be resolved, and decays beyond can. Therefore, the number of observable decays is the total decays that occur beyond delta_x. The fraction observable is 1 - integral from 0 to delta_x of the decay length distribution.

But the decay length distribution PDF is (1/L_avg) exp(-L/L_avg) for L >=0, where L_avg=gamma beta c tau0. Therefore, the fraction observable is integral from delta_x to infinity of (1/L_avg)exp(-L/L_avg) dL = exp(-delta_x/L_avg).

Therefore, the probability that a decay is observable is exp(-delta_x/L_avg). So to get at least 30% observable, exp(-delta_x/L_avg) >=0.3. Then: -delta_x/L_avg >= ln(0.3). Multiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality): delta_x/L_avg <= -ln(0.3). Therefore delta_x <= L_avg (-ln(0.3)). Wait, but wait this is confusing. Wait the observable fraction is exp(-delta_x/L_avg) ≥0.3. So delta_x <= - L_avg ln(0.3). Therefore, the maximum delta_x needed to observe 30% is when delta_x = - L_avg ln(0.3). Therefore, the spatial resolution must be at least delta_x <= - L_avg ln(0.3). Therefore, the minimum resolution required is delta_x <=0.35667 * L_avg.

But L_avg= gamma beta c tau0 =7.917 *0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s= up to calculation before was 1.884e-6 meters. 1.884 micrometers. So delta_x must be <= 0.35667 *1.884 µm =0.672 micrometers, which is 672 nanometers.

But earlier I thought 0.3 is the fraction detectable, but now considering correct: If the observable fraction is exp(-delta_x/L_avg)= 0.3, implying delta_x/L_avg = ln(1/0.3), so delta_x= L_avg * ln(1/0.3)=L_avg *1.20397. Wait, no. exp(-delta_x/L_avg)=0.3. Take natural log: -delta_x/L_avg=ln(0.3). So delta_x= -L_avg * ln(0.3)= L_avg *1.20397. Therefore mistaking that. Wait that conflicts with above.

Hold on, let me redo math. Say the detectable fraction is N/N0= exp(-delta_x/L_avg). If so, then seems that if your resolution is delta_x, the number that decay after delta_x (and hence detectable)

Wait no, the total decay probability is N= integral from 0 to infinity of (1/L_avg) exp(-L/L_avg) dL=1.

But then, the number of decays beyond delta_x is integral from delta_x to infty (1/L_avg) exp(-L/L_avg) dL=exp(-delta_x/L_avg). Therefore, if you require that the spatial resolution is such that at least 30% of the decays are observable, then:

exp(-delta_x/L_avg) >=0.3 ➔ delta_x/L_avg <= -ln(0.3)≈1.20397, so delta_x <=1.204 * L_avg.

This is surprising, because resolution worse than average decay length would be required. But seems contradictory.

Wait but think: The spatial resolution delta_x is the minimal distance over which you can resolve two points. So if a decay occurs within a distance delta_x, you can't distinguish where it decayed from the production vertex. Therefore, anything decaying within delta_x will be seen as happening at the same point. So to "observe" a decay, you need it to happen at a distance longer than delta_x. The longer the decay length, the more likely you can detect it. The requirement is that at least 30% of the decays happen at L > delta_x. So the fraction required is P(L > delta_x)=exp(-delta_x/L_avg) >=0.3. Solving for delta_x:

delta_x <= -L_avg*ln(0.3). Because P(L>delta_x)=exp(-delta_x/L_avg), so 0.3 <= exp(-delta_x/L_avg), which taking natural logarithm, ln(0.3)<= -delta_x/L_avg → delta_x <= -L_avg ln(0.3). Left hand side is ln(0.3)≈-1.20397, so delta_x <= 1.20397 * L_avg.

Therefore, the minimal resolution is that your detector needs to be able to resolve distances up to about 1.2 * L_avg to capture 30% of the decays. Hence minimum resolution is delta_x= L_avg *1.20397, so approx 1.2 *L_avg=1.2 *1.884e-6 meters≈2.261e-6 m =2.261 micrometers. Therefore 2.26 micrometer resolution.

But wait, the mistake I think earlier was exchange of sign. Oh. So, my previous answers conflicted, because depending on how wherehe integration limits.

The detailed steps are:

If you cannot see decay lengths less than delta_x, then observable decays have L > delta_x, so such fraction is exp(-delta_x/L_avg). So if you want this to be >=30%, so exp(-delta_x/L_avg)>=0.3, then delta_x <= -L_avg * ln(0.3), as above, which is delta_x <=1.20397 * L_avg. The answer is delta_x must be <=1.20397*L_avg. But minimum resolution required such that 30% are observable would be the longest delta_x that still allows 30% to be observed, hence delta_x =1.20397*L_avg.

So minimum required resolution is delta_x=1.204*L_avg, which is the maximum allowed delta_x to satisfy the condition. So in essence, requires that the detector can resolve distances down to 1.2*L_avg. So in order to observe at least 30% of the decays, the spatial resolution must be better (smaller) than delta_x=1.2*L_avg. However, this feels counter-intuitive, as expecting better resolution (smaller delta_x) required. But given that some fraction need to decay beyond delta_x, with delta_x chosen as the minimal length required. But with better resolution you get longer decay lengths.

Wait, perhaps confusing the terminology. Resolution is how precise you can measure. So if your resolution is, say, 1 micrometer, you can see that the decay happened at 1 micrometer from the vertex. But how does it relate to the percentage that you observe? The percentage that you observe is equal to the number of decays occurring beyond your spatial resolution. So for the detector's spatial resolution delta_x, all decays with L > delta_x are detected as displaced vertices. Thus, the fraction of decays that you can observe is exp(-delta_x/L_avg), as earlier. So, to have exp(-delta_x/L_avg) >=0.3, implies delta_x <=-L_avg*ln(0.3). For 0.3, ln(0.3)= -1.20397, so delta_x<=1.20397*L_avg.

Therefore, if your spatial resolution is less than or equal to1.20397 * L_avg, then the fraction observed is exp(-delta_x / L_avg) >=0.3. Hence we actually require that delta_x is *smaller* than this value to observe *more* decays, so the minimal resolution is indeed something. Wait, but minimum resolution (as in the worst possible resolution, the coarsest resolution) that allows 30% to be observed. Because delta_x needs to be small to see more features. If your delta_x is big, you can't see small displacements, so you filter out the decays with small decay lengths, so only see the ones that live longer on average.

Wait, the question is "What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?" So minimal resolution refers to the coarsest, i.e., the smallest capability required. But in reality, you need your resolution to be better than some value, so coarser is worse. But let me read again:

"What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?"

 Minimum resolution here likely refers to the minimal (finest) spatial resolution needed. Wait, no... typically resolution is how fine you can measure. So if they ask, "what minimum resolution (i.e., the smallest delta_x) is required", but maybe they mixed up? Maybe the problem is translated, so "minimum resolution" likely refers to the minimum spatial resolution (which would actually be maximum delta_x allowed) to observe at least 30% of decays.

Hmm. Let's check for example:

If your resolution is 2 microns, the displacement must be greater than 2 microns to see it. So a worse resolution (e.g., higher delta_x) would mean you miss more decays. Therefore, to observe at least 30% of the decays, you need your delta_x to be <=1.2 * L_avg.

 But how previously I calculated that with delta_x=1.2* L_avg you observe exp(-1.2)=0.3. So yes.

Wait your required detected fraction is 0.3, delta_x= - L_avg ln(0.3)=1.2*L_avg.

So that is, to see 30% of decays (particles decay beyond delta_x), your spatial resolution must be *at least* so that delta_x was less than 1.2 * L_avg. Because if your resolution is coarser (delta_x bigger than 1.2 * L_avg), then exp(-delta_x/L_avg) would be less than 0.3.

Hence it requires that delta_x <=0 (impossible) but exp(-delta_x/L_avg)=1.0 when delta_x=0 to exp(0)=1.0, f that's not possible. Wait, wait:

When delta_x =0, all decays can be observed because you have perfect resolution. Therefore, the fraction observable is 1.0. As you set delta_x larger, the observablefraction decreases. Therefore, to guarantee at least 30% observable decays (fraction exp(-delta_x/L_avg))>=0.3, then you set delta_x<=-L_avg*ln(0.3), hence the coarsioworst delta^_x (i.e., maximum) is delta_x=1.2 .... So in this case, a resolution equal to delta_x=1.2*L_avg would result in 30% detection. Hence if the detector has resolution better (smaller delta_x) than 1.2*L_avg, you get more than 30%. If the resolution is worse (larger delta_x), you get less than 30%. Therefore, in the question, "what minimum resolution is needed...", requires that delta_x must be less than or equal to1.2*L_avg for the fraction to be at least 30%. The minimal refers to: you don't need error-wise better, coarser does it, but you need delta_x less than or equal to maximum of1.2*L_avg.

But when it says "minimum resolution", perhaps it's phrased inversely. So "resolution" here maybe refers to the detector's resolving power. So, the standard meaning: resolution is the smallest distance the detector can measure. So higher resolution means smaller delta_x. So if they ask for minimum resolution, that is, the minimal (smallest) delta_x to distinguish the decay.

But contradictory terms. I think rather, in English, when someone asks "minimum resolution needed", it is the minimal required resolving power, which is the delta_x such that observing starts being possible. But here guarantee that 30% decays are detected. Therefore, regardless of how you want, the calculation says that the maximum allowable delta_x is 1.2*L_avg to observe 30%, so the minimum resolution level required is this delta_x (or better ↨lower delta_x: better resolution). But typically, you would call the requirement delta_x <=1.2 L_avg. Thus, to achieve 30% observation, you need better resolution than this limit.

But paradoxically, in technical terms, resolution is such that your device can't resolve beneath that. Therefore, the minimum required resolution is how finely you need it, and that would be that the resolving power must be at least 1.2*L_avg, but phrased awkwardly.

However, given my second calculation where Hmm, the initial step confused something.

Wait we have a X^0 which is moving with gamma ≈7.9, beta ≈0.99, so lifetime dilation of about7.9, average decay length L_avg=gamma beta c tau0=7.9 *0.99*3e8*m/s*(8e-16 s)=?

Let me compute that once again for accuracy.

gamma=27 /3.41≈7.917 approx.

beta=sqrt(1 - (m/(E))²)=sqrt(1 -(3.41/27)^2)=sqrt(1 -0.01595)=sqrt(0.98404)=0.992.

Thus, beta=0.992.

Therefore, gamma= 27 /3.41=7.917, as above.

tau0=8e-16 seconds.

Therefore, average decay length L_avg=gamma beta c tau0.

gamma=7.917*0.992≈7.854. Then *speed of light c=3e8 m/s. So:

gamma beta c =7.854 *3e8 m/s ≈23.56e8 m/s.

Then, tau0=8e-16 s.

L_avg=23.56e8 m/s *8e-16 s=23.56*8e-8 m=188.5e-8 m=1.885e-6 meters=1.885 micrometers.

Therefore, average decay length is ≈1.885 µm.

Then, to have observable fraction≥30%, i.e., δ_x<=-L_avg*ln(0.3)=1.885e-6 m *1.20397≈2.268e-6 m=2.268 microm.

Wait, so if resolution is delta_x≈2.27 micrometers, then observable fraction is 30%. Therefore, minimum resolution you can have (i.e., the maximum allowed delta_x) to still observe 30% is2.27 micrometers. But resolution in terms of detector precision usually is betterthan that. If the resolution is equal to or finer (better) than 2.27 micrometers, you can observeat least 30%. Hence, perhaps ans is2.27 micrometers.

But the problem statesspatial resolution needed. So needdelta_xθ∼? I think they mean answer here is Approximately that but let me think unit check:

 delta_x= L_avg*(-ln(0.3)). So 1.885e-6 m multiplied by1.20397= 2.268e-6m=2.27 micrometers. Or:

As calculated earlier with more precise numbers, previously got ≈0.67 micrometers. But with correct derivation later =2.27 micrometer.

So these two conflicting results. Haul_over(Is proper resolution delta_x such that 30% are occurrence beyond delta_x? Therefore, needed resolution is 0.3. If detection_shop occur with ex Probability, exp(-delta_x/L_avg)=0.3.

delta_x=-L_avg * ln(0.3)=1.885e-6 *1.203=2.268e-6 m≈2.27e-6 m. 2.27 micrometers.

While the average decay length is≈1.88 micrometers. Thus, asks, why the resolution needs to be slightly greater than the average decay length? Because given exponential decay—a portion of particles decay at longer distances than the average.

Wait example,expWith average L_avg=1.88 micrometers, the distribution of decay lengths will Particles decay at distances longer than average: For exponential distribution,  the median is ln(2)*L_avg≈0.693*1.88≈1.305microns. Wait it might not make sense? No—exponential decay decreasing, so more particles decay earlier. The mean is larger than the median.

Wait, for an exponential distribution, the average is(1/L_avg) (integral from0 toinfinite L*exp(-L/L_avg) dL ) =L_avg. So decay lengths L are distributed with mean L_avg.

So it's clear that some particles beta decay beyond L_avg, but multiplied by a factor e pp, indeed, the integral from_infty toL_avg * of PDF——e.g., for L>L_avg, integral decays t①.

But to get the probability that L>delta_x:

P= exp(-delta_x/L_avg). If delta_x= L_avg, this probability is exp(-1)=~0.3679≈36.8%. If delta_x=2.27 ink to_avg= ~1.2. Therefore, corresponding probability~exp(-1.203)=approx0.3.

Yes. So delta_x=1.2x L_avg gives P(~L>delta_x)=30%。Therefore.

Therefore, the answer is hard computation.

But need to acknowledge all steps.

Therefore, the minimum resolution (most course resolution, maximum allowed delta_x) required to observe at least 30% of the decays is delta_x≈-. L_avg * ln(0.3)=1.20397 *1.884 micrometers≈2.268 micrometers.

Convert to meters and other units, but typical bubble chamber resolution is in millimeters or meters, but at micrometers scale.

I think this is correct. Let me confirm with precise numbers:

Calculate ln(0.3)≈-1.203972804326.

L_avg=gamma * beta * c * tau0.

gamma=27 /1.3.41: c

Wait redo gamma=27 GeV /3.41 GeV=7.917 roughly exact. So problem says that X^0 has energy 27 GeV. But another thought:

Wait is the energy of X^0 the total energy—so gamma=7. So if X^0 is moving with energy E=gamma m c², then bygiven E=27 GeV, m_X=3.41 GeV (presumably GeV/c²). Therefore gamma=E/(m_X c²)*c². But actually, in natural units where c=1, energy E in GeV, mass m in GeV/c². So gamma= E / m_x=27GeV /3.41GeV/c² *c²?

Wait no, if units are using GeV for energy and GeV/c² for mass, then in natural units where c=1, E (GeV)= gamma m (GeV/c²)c²=gamma m (GeV).  Therefore, gamma= E/m_x。 first slotGamma turns on beta.

So indeed, E= gamma m_x, which comes out as unitless ? NO: E is energy, m_x is mass energy. So if we write E= gamma m_x c².

But in the value given problem gives: the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. So probably, that's the total energy. So The total enenrgy E of X^0 is 27 GeV, and m_X is 3.41 GeV/c², so gamma=E/(m_X c²)=27 GeV / (3.41GeV/c²)c²=27/3.41 ≃7.917.  good.

So everything else proceeds as before.

Compute gamma=7.917, beta=sqrt(1−(3.41/27)^2)=approx0.992.

Mean lifetime:tau_lab=gamma*tau0=7.917*8e-16 s≃6.3336e-15秒。

Doppler length:L_avg=v tau_lab=0.992*3e8m/s *6.3336e-15秒≈0.992*3*6.3336*1e-7 meters≃18.867*1e-7≈1.8867e-6 meters again, so approximately1.887 micrometers.

Therefore delta_x=-L_avg*ln(0.3)=1.887 µm*(1.20397)=2.272 µm。

gamma=27 /3.41≈7.917259.

beta= sqrt(1– (3.41²/27²))= sqrt(1 – (11.6281/729))=sqrt(1–0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.992.

L_avg=γ β c τ0=27/3.41*0.992*3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

 再说了：

Calculating L_avg:

First convert gamma, beta:

gamma=Exactly, compute 27 /3.41:

3.41 *7=23.87

27 -23.87=3.13

3.41*0.9=3.069

so up to 7.917.

Thusgamma=7.917.

beta=sqrt(1-(3.41/27)^2)=sqrt(1-0.0159559)=0.992004.

Coefficient γβ=7.917*0.992004=7.854.

Then,

gamma*beta*c*tau0=7.854 * 3e8 m/s*8e-16 s=7.854*3*8*1e-8 m=7.854*24e-8=188.496e-8 m=1.88496e-6 meters≈1.885微米. Therefore, exact L_avg≈1.885e-6 meters.

So delta_x=-ln(0.3)*Lavg=1.20397*1.885e-6≈ 1.20397*1.885  suspender of terms:

 multiply1.2*1.885=2.262, extra 0.00397*1.885≈0.00748, total≈2.262+0.00748=2.2695, ≈2.27e-6 meters=2.27 micrometers. Hence, the required spatial resolution is approximately2.3 micrometers.

Hold on: gamma is 7.917, beta=0.992,c=3e8 m/s, tau0= 8e-16 s.

So L_avg=7.917 *0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.= Compute separately:

Multiply 7.917 *0.992≈7.854.

Then c*tau0=3e8 m/s*8e-16 s=24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Then L_avg=7.854*2.4e-7m= 18.85e-7m=1.885e-6 m. This iswas correct.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays of this particle X^0. The problem says the proper lifetime of X^0 is 8e-16 seconds, and the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. The mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. Hmm, let me start breaking this down.

First, in particle physics, when they talk about lifetime and observing decays, I remember that relativistic effects come into play because the particles are moving at high speeds. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, but in the lab frame (Bubble Chamber here), the lifetime would be dilated due to time dilation. So the actual lifetime we observe should be gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But then, the problem is about the resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Resolution usually refers to spatial resolution here, right? So we're probably talking about the distance the particle travels before decaying. If the detector can't resolve very short tracks, then even if the particle decays, we might not see it. Therefore, the minimum resolution would correspond to the average decay length that 30% of the particles would have.

Wait, the average decay length is given by the speed of the particle multiplied by its lifetime in the lab frame. But how does the 30% factor into this? Maybe the probability that the particle decays within a certain distance. So, the number of decays observed is related to the exponential decay law. The survival probability is N/N0 = exp(-t/tau), so the decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/tau). But here, they want to observe at least 30% of the decays. So we need to set 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab) >= 0.3, which gives t = -tau_lab * ln(0.7). Then the distance would be velocity * t. So the minimum resolution must be less than or equal to this distance. Wait, but actually, to observe the decay, the decay must happen within a detectable distance. So if the decay length is longer than the resolution, we can observe it. Wait, no. If our detector has a spatial resolution of delta_x, then tracks longer than delta_x can be resolved. Therefore, the decay length has to be longer than delta_x to be detected. So we need the decay length to be at least delta_x such that a fraction of 30% of the decays occur beyond delta_x. Wait, no, because the number of decays occurring beyond a certain distance is less due to the exponential decay. Wait, hold on.

Alternatively, the decay probability as a function of distance. The decay length L = gamma * v * tau_0. Where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Then the probability that a particle decays before traveling a distance L is given by integrating the exponential distribution. So actually, the decay probability as a function of distance is similar to time, using the relation t = L / (v). So let me write that down.

In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau0. The decay occurs at a time t in the lab frame, so the distance traveled is v*t. The probability that the decay happens before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma*tau0)). Substituting t = L / v, so the probability is 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)). Therefore, if we want the probability to be at least 30%, we set 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) >= 0.3. Then L must be such that exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) <= 0.7, so -L/(gamma*v*tau0) <= ln(0.7), hence L >= -gamma*v*tau0*ln(0.7). Therefore, the decay length must be at least gamma*v*tau0*(-ln(0.7)) for 30% of the decays to occur past that point? Wait, no, that might not be.

Hold on, thinking again. Let me formalize. The number of particles remaining at time t is N(t) = N0 exp(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab = gamma*tau0. The number of particles that have decayed is N0 - N(t) = N0(1 - exp(-t/tau_lab)). The decay probability is (N0 - N(t))/N0 = 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab). So if we set 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab) = 0.3, that means 30% decay probability. If we solve for t, we get t = -tau_lab * ln(1 - 0.3) = -gamma tau0 ln(0.7). Then the corresponding distance L is v * t = -gamma v tau0 ln(0.7). But wait, this is the time it takes for 30% of the particles to decay. So the distance traveled by the particle in that time is the decay length needed such that 30% of the decays have occurred before L. Therefore, to observe 30% of the decays, you need your detector to be able to see decay lengths down to L. So the spatial resolution should be at least that L to resolve those decay vertices. Hence, minimum resolution required is L = gamma * v * tau0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Therefore, I need to compute gamma and v. The problem gives the energy of the X^0 particle, which is 27 GeV, and its mass is 3.41 GeV, so we can compute gamma and beta (v/c).

So first, gamma is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So gamma = E / m_x = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 27 / 3.41 ≈ let's calculate that.

3.41 times 7 is 23.87, then 3.41*7.9 ≈ 3.41*7 + 3.41*0.9 ≈ 23.87 + 3.069 ≈ 26.939, which is close to 27. So approx 7.9. Therefore, gamma ≈ 7.91... Let me do it more precisely. 3.41 * 7.9 = 3.41 * (8 - 0.1) = 27.28 - 0.341 = 26.939. So 27 GeV is 0.061 GeV more, so 0.061 /3.41 ≈ 0.01787. So total gamma is approx 7.9 + 0.01787 ≈ 7.918, approximately 7.92.

But let me use exact numbers. 3.41 γ = 27, γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute 27 / 3.41.

27 divided by 3.41: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 27 -23.87 =3.13. 3.13 /3.41≈0.917. So gamma ≈7.917. So 7.917. So γ = 7.917.

Then, beta can be found from gamma. gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.917)^2)).

Calculate 7.917 squared, which is approx. Let's see, 8^2 =64. So 7.917 squared is (8 -0.083)^2 = 64 - 2*8*0.083 + 0.083^2 ≈64 -1.328 +0.0069≈62.6789. So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/62.6789) = sqrt(1 -0.01596) = sqrt(0.98404) ≈0.992. Therefore, beta ≈0.992, so speed is 0.992c.

Alternatively, since gamma = E/mc² but here energy already in GeV, so actually, total energy E=gamma mc². Wait, of course, (since E=gamma m c^2) So the 27 GeV is 'gamma * m_x', with m_x in GeV/c². So yes, exactly, gamma = E / m_x = 27 / 3.41 ≈7.917. Then beta is as calculated above.

But let me verify beta properly.

Given E = gamma m_x c^2 and momentum p = gamma beta m_x c.

So beta can also be calculated via beta = pc / E. Yes. Alternatively, with E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_x c^2)^2, so (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m_x c^2)^2. So pc = sqrt(E^2 - m_x^2 c^4)/c. But perhaps easier to use beta = sqrt(1 - (m_x / E)^2). Is that right? Let's see:

From E = gamma m c^2, so gamma = E/(m c^2). Then beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)). Therefore, beta = sqrt(1 - (m_x^2 c^4)/E^2 ). Since m_x c^2 = 3.41 GeV, E is 27 GeV. So beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.01595) ≈sqrt(0.98405) ≈0.992, so same as before. Therefore beta ≈0.992. So v ≈0.992c. Therefore, beta gamma is, gamma is 7.917, so beta gamma=0.992 *7.917≈7.854.

So now, with that speed, the mean lifetime in lab is gamma tau0. Given tau0=8e-16 seconds.

Therefore, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau≈7.917 *8e-16 s=6.3336e-15 s.

Then, the mean decay length is v tau_lab=beta c gamma tau0. We have beta gamma= approx 7.854, so giving distance of 7.854 * c tau0.

But let me step-by-step, in case I mix it up.

Average decay length L_avg = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau0. Since tau_lab = gamma tau0. So average decay length is also beta c gamma tau0. Alternatively, it's gamma beta c tau0, same thing. So and so with the average.

But we need not the average, bu

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the X^0 particle decays. Given information includes: proper lifetime of 8e-16 seconds, energy in the Bubble Chamber of 27 GeV, and the X^0 mass of 3.41 GeV.

In particle physics, the proper lifetime is measured in the particle's rest frame, but what we observe in the lab frame is affected by time dilation. The observed lifetime in the lab is the proper lifetime multiplied by the Lorentz factor (gamma).

The question concerns the spatial resolution required to observe these decays. This relates to the distance the particle travels before decaying. If the detector cannot resolve very short tracks, we might miss decay events. Therefore, the minimum resolution would correspond to the decay length that allows us to observe at least 30% of the particles.

The decay length is calculated by multiplying the particle's speed by its lifetime in the lab frame. The probability of decay follows an exponential law: N/N0 = exp(-t/tau), meaning the decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/tau). To observe 30% of decays, we need 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab) ≥ 0.3, which gives t = -tau_lab * ln(0.7).

The decay probability as a function of distance is 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)), where L is the distance traveled. If we want this probability to be at least 30%, then L must be such that exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) ≤ 0.7, which means L ≥ -gamma*v*tau0*ln(0.7).

Therefore, the minimum resolution required is L = gamma * v * tau0 * (-ln(0.7)).

To calculate this, I need gamma and v. Gamma is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy: gamma = E/m_x = 27 GeV/3.41 GeV ≈ 7.917.

Beta (v/c) can be calculated from gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = sqrt(1 - 1/7.917²) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.01596) ≈ 0.992.

Alternatively, beta = sqrt(1 - (m_x/E)²) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)²) = sqrt(1 - 0.01595) ≈ 0.992, confirming our calculation.

Therefore, beta*gamma ≈ 0.992 * 7.917 ≈ 7.854.

The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma*tau0 ≈ 7.917 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.3336e-15 s.

The average decay length is v*tau_lab = beta*c*gamma*tau0 = beta*gamma*c*tau0 ≈ 7.854*c*tau0.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's rephrase the given text:

I need to determine the minimum resolution necessary to detect at least 30% of the decays of a particle called X^0. The problem specifies that the proper lifetime of X^0 is 8e-16 seconds, and the energy within the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. The mass of X^0 is given as 3.41 GeV. Let's break this down further.

In particle physics, when discussing lifetime and decay observation, we consider relativistic effects due to particles moving at high velocities. The proper lifetime is measured in the particle's rest frame, but in the lab frame (like our Bubble Chamber), the observed lifetime is extended because of time dilation. Thus, the lifetime we observe corresponds to the proper lifetime multiplied by the Lorentz factor, gamma.

However, the problem pertains to the resolution required to see at least 30% of the decays, which likely refers to spatial resolution. This implies we're discussing the distance a particle travels before decaying. If a detector can't resolve very short tracks, decays may happen, but go unobserved. Thus, the minimum resolution should correspond to the average decay length where 30% of particles decay.

The average decay length is calculated by the particle's velocity multiplied by its lab-frame lifetime. How does the 30% factor in? It suggests the probability of decay within a certain distance. Using the exponential decay law, N/N0 = exp(-t/tau), gives the decay probability as 1 - exp(-t/tau). To observe at least 30% of decays, set 1 - exp(-t/tau_lab) >= 0.3, leading to t = -tau_lab * ln(0.7). The distance then is velocity * t. Hence, resolution must be at this distance or less. However, detectable decay occurs only if the decay happens within a resolvable distance. 

Alternatively, look at decay probability versus distance. Decay length L = gamma * v * tau_0, with gamma being the Lorentz factor, v velocity, and tau_0 the proper lifetime. The probability of decay before traveling distance L comes from integrating the exponential distribution. So, the decay probability is 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)). To have this probability at least 30%, set 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) >= 0.3, hence L >= -gamma*v*tau0*ln(0.7). Thus, the decay length should be at least gamma*v*tau0*(-ln(0.7)) to ensure 30% occur past that point.

Determining gamma and v is necessary. Energy of the X^0 particle is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV, enabling gamma and beta (v/c) calculation.

Firstly, gamma equals total energy divided by rest mass energy. Therefore, gamma = E / m_x = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Assume gamma ≈ 7.917 through more precise calculations.

Obtain beta from gamma using beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). For beta, compute 7.917 squared (approx. 62.6789) resulting in beta ≈ 0.992, hence speed is 0.992c.

Verification of beta through momentum p and energy E yields beta = pc / E, or alternatively by beta = sqrt(1 - (m_x / E)^2). Again, beta ≈ 0.992 after detailed calculation; result offering v ≈ 0.992c. Consequently, beta gamma is approx 7.854.

With speed determined, compute mean lifetime in lab as gamma tau0: gamma ≈ 7.917 *8e-16 s = 6.3336e-15 s.

Consequently, mean decay length is v tau_lab= beta c gamma tau0, approx beta gamma c tau0. We're seeking not the average, but the minimum measurable distance.

But maybe the requirement is to have 30% of the decays occur, so 30% of all decays would be due to particles that decayed within their path length being equal or greater than the resolution. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the way to think about it is if the detector has spatial resolution delta_x, it can\'t distinguish two points closer than delta_x. Therefore, if a particle decays after a distance L that is shorter than delta_x, the detector can\'t resolve the decay vertex from the production vertex, and thus can\'t observe the decay. So in order to observe a decay, the decay must occur at a distance L > delta_x. Thus, the number of observable decays is N_obs = N_total * P(L > delta_x) = N_total * exp(-delta_x / (gamma beta c tau0)).\n\nTherefore, in order to have N_obs / N_total = 0.3, we need exp(-delta_x / (gamma beta c tau0)) = 0.3. Solving for delta_x: delta_x = - gamma beta c tau0 * ln(0.3).\n\nBut wait, but wait. If the observed decays are those that happen at a distance greater than delta_x, because we can\'t see decays that happen too close. So, we need exp(-delta_x/(gamma beta c tau0))=0.3. Therefore delta_x >= -gamma beta c tau0 ln(0.3). Wait, hang on.\n\nLet me clarify this carefully. Suppose we have a particle that lives for a certain time with exponential decay. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau0, and it\'s moving at speed v= beta c. The probability density for decaying at a time t is (1/(gamma tau0)) exp(-t/(gamma tau0)). The decay occurs at position x = v t.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a decay occurs within a distance x from the production point is the same as the probability that the decay time is t = x/v. So the cumulative probability distribution function for x is P(X <= x) = 1 - exp(-x/(v gamma tau0)). Therefore, the probability that the decay occurs at a distance greater than x is P(X > x) = exp(-x/(v gamma tau0)).\n\nIf the detector cannot resolve the decay vertex if the decay occurs within x_min, then the probability to observe a decay is exp(-x_min/(v gamma tau0)). The problem states that we need to "observe at least 30% of the decays," so exp(-x_min/(v gamma tau0)) >= 0.3.\n\nSolving for x_min: x_min <= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). Therefore, the required spatial resolution must satisfy:\n\nx_min <= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3) to observe at least 30% of the decays.\n\nBut x_min here represents the minimum detectable decay length. So if our detector has a resolution delta_x, then we can detect decay lengths greater than delta_x. Hence, to observe 30% of the decays, we need delta_x <= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). Wait, no. To observe 30% of the decays, we need the fraction of decays with X > delta_x to be at least 0.3. Which implies exp(-delta_x/(v gamma tau0)) >=0.3.\n\nTherefore, solving for delta_x: exp(-delta_x/(v gamma tau0)) >=0.3 => -delta_x/(v gamma tau0) >= ln(0.3) => delta_x <= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3)\n\nSo therefore, delta_x <= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). Therefore, the resolution must be at least (i.e., delta_x needs to be smaller than or equal to this value). Wait, but spatial resolution being "smaller than" what?\n\nWait, higher resolution corresponds to a smaller delta_x, the minimum distance that can be measured. So, in order to see decays that happened at a very small distance, you need a very high (good) resolution (small delta_x).\n\nBut in this problem, they ask for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, that would be the (delta_x)_min = -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). So the resolution needs to be smaller than or equal to this, right?\n\nWait no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf you have a spatial resolution of delta_x, then any decay occurring over a distance longer than delta_x can be resolved (i.e., detected as a decay), whereas decays occurring within delta_x cannot be distinguished from the primary vertex. So the number of observed decays would be proportional to the probability that the particle decays beyond delta_x: P(X > delta_x) = exp(-delta_x/(v gamma tau0)). So to have P(X > delta_x) = 30%, set exp(-delta_x/(v gamma tau0)) = 0.3, solve for delta_x = -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3).\n\nThus, delta_x is the distance at which if you can resolve that distance, you will see 30% of the decays. So the required spatial resolution is delta_x = -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). Therefore, this is the maximum spatial resolution required in order to be able to detect at least 30% of the decays.\n\nTherefore, to find this delta_x, we must calculate v gamma tau0. But wait, combining with the previous quantities:\n\nWe have gamma ≈7.917, v=beta c=0.992c, tau0=8e-16 s. Let\'s compute the terms.\n\nFirst, compute gamma * beta * c tau0. The product of these terms.\n\ngamma=7.917, beta≈0.992, c≈3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.\n\nFirst, compute beta gamma: 7.917*0.992≈7.854\n\nNext, c*tau0: 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s = 24e-8 m = 2.4e-7 m= 2.4e-4 mm= 0.24 micrometers.\n\nBut maybe convert units to meters.\n\nHold on, c is 3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s. So c*tau0=3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 meters. Then, beta gamma=7.854. So beta gamma c tau0=7.854 * 2.4e-7 m= 18.8496e-7 meters=1.88496e-6 meters=1.88496 microns. Then, multiplied by -ln(0.3). ln(0.3)= -1.20397, so -ln(0.3)=1.20397. Therefore, the resolution delta_x=1.88496e-6 m *1.20397≈2.2705e-6 m≈2.2705 microns≈2.27 micrometers.\n\nTherefore, the spatial resolution must be at least approximately 2.27 micrometers in order to observe 30% of the decays.\n\nBut wait, isn\'t this a very small length? Is 2 microns achievable in bubble chambers? Hmm, not sure, but perhaps. Anyway, the problem is not about practicality, but calculation.\n\nBut wait, want to check the steps again for possible mistakes.\n\nFirst, gamma=27 GeV / 3.41 GeV=7.917. Okay.\n\nBeta=sqrt(1 - (m_x / E)^2)=sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2)=sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2)=sqrt(0.98407)=approx 0.992, correct.\n\nBeta gamma= 7.917 *0.992≈7.854.\n\nc=3e8 m/s.\n\nTau0=8e-16 s.\n\nTherefore, beta gamma c tau0=7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s. Wait, hang on: units.\n\nBut c tau0 is 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-8 meters. So beta gamma *c tau0=beta gamma * c tau0.\n\nHold on, beta gamma c tau0= v/c gamma c tau0= gamma beta c tau0.\n\nBut no:\n\nSince beta= v/c, so v= beta c. Therefore, decay length of particle is L= v tau_lab= beta c gamma tau0. So average decay L_avg= beta c gamma tau0. Therefore, speed quotient correct.\n\nBut yes, in our case, when calculating the quantity -beta gamma c tau0 ln(0.3):\n\nv gamma tau0= beta c gamma tau0= beta gamma c tau0. Therefore:\n\n- ln(0.3)*beta gamma c tau0.\n\nWait, so:\n\ndelta_x= - v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). Wait, hold up. So in the expression for P(X > delta_x)=exp(-delta_x/(v gamma tau0)), set to 0.3. So we have -delta_x/(v gamma tau0)=ln(0.3), so delta_x= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). So v is beta c. Therefore,\n\ndelta_x= - beta c gamma tau0 ln(0.3).\n\nGiven:\n\nbeta=0.992, gamma=7.917, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.\n\nTherefore,\n\nbeta c approx 0.992 *3e8≈2.976e8 m/s.\n\ngamma tau0≈7.917 *8e-16≈6.3336e-15 s.\n\nSo, multiply these together:\n\nbeta c * gamma tau0≈2.976e8 m/s *6.3336e-15 s≈(2.976 *6.3336) e (8-15)≈18.85e-7 m≈1.885e-6 m. So 1.885 microns.\n\nThen multiply by ln(0.3-1):\n\nln(0.3)= -1.20397, so negative of that is 1.20397. So:\n\ndelta_x≈1.885e-6 m *1.20397≈2.270e-6 meters≈2.27 microns.\n\nSo in meters, that\'s 2.27e-6 meters, or 2.27 micrometers.\n\nNow, converting into more physics-appropriate units, maybe meters, centimeters, millimeters, or even nanometers, but micrometers seems correct here.\n\nThus, 2.27 micrometers.\n\nBut to answer the problem, should it be in meters, or centimeters? The answer might need to be in meters. The problem only says \'resolution\' but doesn\'t specify units, but bubble chamber resolutions are typically in millimeters or centimeters. Hmm. However, from the calculation, it\'s around a couple of microns. This seems quite small, but given the very short lifetime of 8e-16 seconds, which even when the particle is moving at a high gamma factor, it\'s still covering a very small distance.\n\nDouble-checking if the calculation is correct. Let me compute all constants numerically.\n\nFirst, given:\n\nGamma = 27 /3.41 ≈7.917259.\n\nBeta = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2 /27^2)) = sqrt(1 - (11.6281/729))=sqrt(1 - 0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.992. So beta is approx 0.992.\n\nHolding more decimal places: better calculation:\n\n(3.41)^2 = ?\n\n3.41 *3.41:\n\n3*3=9,\n\n3*0.41=1.23,\n\n0.41*3=1.23,\n\n0.41*0.41=0.1681.\n\nSo 3.41*3.41= (3 +0.41)^2=9 + 2*1.23 + 0.1681= 9 + 2.46 +0.1681=11.6281.\n\nSo, 3.41²=11.6281 GeV²/c⁴.\n\nEnergy squared E² =27²=729 GeV²/c².\n\nThus, beta²=1 - (m² c⁴)/(E² c²) here?\n\nWait confusion between energy and momentum. Probably due to units.\n\nActually, remembering gamma= E/(m c²), beta = v/c= pc/(E), where p is momentum. So, E²=(pc)^2 + (m c²)^2\n\nWhich gives:\n\n(pc)²= E² - (m c²)^2\n\nBut beta= (p c)/ (E)\n\nWait beta = (p c)/ E = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/E = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²))=sqrt(1 - (m c²/E )² ).\n\nYes. So if E and m are given in units of GeV, with c=1 in natural units. But perhaps that\'s causing confusion.\n\nWait, if we are working in natural units where c=1, then E (in GeV) equals gamma m (in GeV). Beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2). So making sense.\n\nSince the mass is 3.41 GeV, and energy is27 GeV, so beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2)=sqrt(1 -0.01595)= same value.\n\nTherefore, in natural units (c=1), distance is in GeV^{-1}, but here in the problem, we have SI units: c in m/s, tau0 in seconds.\n\nBut going back to the calculation, since c=3e8 m/s.\n\nAnother way to compute delta_x:\n\ndelta_x = - beta gamma c tau0 ln(0.3).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nbeta =0.992,\n\ngamma=7.917,\n\nc=3e8 m/s,\n\ntau0=8e-16 s,\n\nln(0.3)= -1.20397.\n\nSo,\n\n0.992*7.917=7.854,\n\n7.854 *3e8=2.356e9 (unit:m/s * s? Wait. Wait:\n\nWait, beta * gamma *c * tau0 * ln(0.3^{-1})).\n\nWait: . No:\n\nbeta*c*gamma*tau0 is:\n\n(beta* c)*(gamma tau0 )\n\nBut beta*c is ~ 0.992*3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.\n\nGamma tau0 is ~7.917*8e-16 s ≈6.33e-15 s.\n\nMultiplying these: 2.976e8 m/s *6.33e-15 s≈(2.976*6.33) e (8 -15)=18.85e-7 m≈1.885e-6 m= 1.885 microns.\n\nMultiply by ln(1/0.3)=1.2039: 1.885 *1.2039≈2.27 microns. Correct.\n\nTherefore, delta_x≈2.27 micrometers.\n\nSo, in meters, 2.27e-6 meters, which is 2.27 micrometers.\n\nBut whether this is the correct unit?\n\nBubble chambers typically have spatial resolutions on the order of 100 micrometers or so, so 2 microns seems like a very high resolution. But maybe in some cases, but perhaps the problem is designed to have this result. So probably correct.\n\nBut let me think: perhaps an order of magnitude check.\n\nGiven the proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. If the particle were at rest, it would decay in place. If it\'s moving at high speed, its lifetime is longer. Gamma 7.9 so lifetime in lab is about 8e-16 *8 =6.4e-15 seconds. Moving at 0.992c, so the distance is v t=0.992*3e8 *6.4e-15. That\'s about (0.992*3e8)*(6.4e-15)= 2.976e8 *6.4e-15≈1.90e-6 meters: the average decay length is approximately 1.9 microns. Therefore, this is the average distance, which jives with our previous calculation. Thus, observing 30% means that the cumulative probability beyond delta_x is 30%. Since the average is around 1.9 microns, but you need to see 30% decays. Since it\'s an exponential distribution, so the tail part. So if you take 30% of the decays, which are the ones with longer than average path lengths? No, the cumulative probability beyond L).\n\nWait, but according to the exponential distribution, only about exp(-1)≈37% survive past the mean. Wait, the mean is theta= beta gamma c tau0. The probability that x > theta: exp(-theta/theta)=exp(-1)≈0.367. So in our case, if delta_x= beta gamma c tau0, which is 1.9 microns, then only 36.7% would decay beyond that. But we need to reach 30%, we need a shorter delta_x so that 30% of the total It’s easier/more probable to have a decay after longer distances?, inversely. Wait no.\n\nActually for an exponential distribution, f(x) = (1/theta) e^{-x/theta} for x >=0. The survival function P(X >x) = e^{-x/theta}. theta= average. So if theta is average decay length (1.9 microns), than P(X> theta)=e^{-1}≈36.8%. So asking for 30% would correspond to x> delta_x where delta_x>theta.\n\nWait, e^{-x/theta}=0.3,\n\nx= -theta ln0.3 ≈ theta*1.20397. Hmm our earlier result. So, x= theta * ln(1/0.3). Therefore, we have to have P(X > delta_x)=0.3, so exp{-delta_x/theta}=0.3 →delta_x= theta*ln(1/0.3)=approx theta*1.203.\n\nTherefore, given that theta=1.885 microns then delta_x=1.885*1.203≈2.27 microns.\n\nTherefore, our calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, about 2.27 µm is an accurate value.\n\nSo the minimum needed resolution is approximately 2.3 micrometers. But let\'s formalize the answer with precision.\n\nGiven:\n\ngamma=27 /3.41≈7.917258739\n\nbeta= sqrt(1 - (3.41 /27)^2)≈sqrt(1 -0.01595)≈0.992027\n\nv=beta c≈0.992027 *2.99792e8 m/s (since proper c=2.99792e8 m/s), approx 2.975e8 m/s).\n\ngamma*tau0=7.917258739 *8e-16≈6.3338e-15 s.\n\nThen, the decay length for 30% observation:\n\ndelta_x= -v * gamma tau0* ln(0.3)=?\n\nWait, no, delta_x= -beta*c* gamma tau0 * ln(0.3). Let\'s use exact calculations now.\n\ndelta_x= beta*gamma*c*tau0* ln(1/0.3)\n\nCompute each part:\n\nbeta*gamma= (27 /3.41)/sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) which, but we can use numbers above. We had beta≈0.992027, gamma≈7.91726.\n\nbeta*gamma≈ 0.992027 *7.91726≈7.85483.\n\ntau0=8e-16 s\n\nc=299792458 m/s, so using exact value for perhaps more precision.\n\nThus,\n\nβ*gamma*c*tau0* ln(1/0.3)\n\n=7.85483 * 299792458 m/s *8e-16 s *1.20397\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\nFirst, beta*gamma*c*tau0=7.85483 *2.99792458e8 *8e-16≈First calculate 7.85483 *2.99792458e8:\n\n7.85483 *2.99792458e8≈ approx 7.85 *3e8=2.355e9, subtract a bit. Alternatively, precise calculation:\n\n7.85483 *2.99792458e8 =7.85483 *299792458= let\'s compute:\n\n299792458 *7 =2,098,547,206,\n\n299792458*0.8=239,833,966.4\n\n299792458*0.05=14,989,622.9\n\n299792458*0.00483=1,448,323.612, approx.\n\nAdding all:\n\n2,098,547,206 +\n\n239,833,966.4 =2,338,381,172.4 +\n\n14,989,622.9 =2,353,370,795.3 +\n\n1,448,323.612≈2,354,819,118.91\n\nSo approx 2.354819e9.\n\nMultiply by 8e-16:\n\n2.354819e9 *8e-16=1.883855e-6 meters (since 1e9 *1e-16=1e-7, then *8 and 2.3548≈23.548*1e-7*8=?)\n\nWait 2.354819e9 *8e-16= (2.354819 *8)e (9-16)=18.83855e-7=1.883855e-6 meters.\n\nSo beta gamma c tau0≈1.883855e-6 meters.\n\nMultiply by ln(1/0.3)=1.203972:\n\n1.883855e-6 *1.203972≈1.883855*1.203972≈approx1.883855*1=1.883855, 1.883855*0.2=0.376771, 1.883855*0.003972≈0.00747. Sum these:1.883855 +0.376771≈2.2606 +0.00747≈2.268, from there≈2.268e-6 meters.\n\nSo delta_x≈2.268e-6 meters≈2.268 micrometers. So about 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, rounded to three significant figures, since given proper lifetime as 8e-16 s (1 sig fig?), wait given Mass to three sig figs (3.41 GeV), so, mass with 3, energy has two. Hmmm. Original data: tau0 is 8e-16: one significant figure, but noted as 8, so 8.0e-16? Next, energy is 27 GeV: two sig figs. If we\'re strict, the answer should be to two sig figs. so 2.3 micrometers. But since 30% is given as two sig figs as well, and 3.41 GeV is three sig figs.\n\nBut actually tau is given as 8e-16 which likely is one, making final answer would be uncertain. But in the problem, the presentation is sufficient for . From original problem: tau_0=8e-16 s, 27 GeV, 3.41 GeV. So at least three sig figs (from 3.41). In this case, perhaps providing delta_x≈2.27 micrometers.\n\nBut in having to do precise calculation, since with our detailed result we get 2.268e-6 m. The problem obviously would want the answer expressed as around 2.3 micrometers. Or maybe they expect answers in meters, with scientific notation. So then 2.27e-6 meters. Perhaps 2.3e-6 meters or 2.3 µm.\n\nAlternatively, one might have a different approach if I use velocity in terms of exact beta and Gamma. But my results will not change. Therefore, finally, I think the answer is 2.3 micrometers minimum resolution needed.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum resolution needed is \\boxed{2.3 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1743814670, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5815, prompt_tokens=2392, total_tokens=8207, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \(X^0\), we need to consider the relativistic effects and exponential decay law. Here are the key steps:

1. **Relativistic Gamma Factor**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m_X} = \frac{27 \, \text{GeV}}{3.41 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 7.917
   \]

2. **Velocity (Beta)**:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m_X}{E}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3.41}{27}\right)^2} \approx 0.992
   \]

3. **Lab Frame Lifetime**:
   \[
   \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

4. **Average Decay Length**:
   The average decay length in the lab frame is given by \( \beta \gamma c \tau_0 \):
   \[
   \beta \gamma c \tau_0 = 0.992 \times 7.917 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]

5. **Decay Probability**:
   To find the distance \( \delta_x \) such that 30% of the decays are observed, we use:
   \[
   \exp\left(-\frac{\delta_x}{\beta \gamma c \tau_0}\right) = 0.3
   \]
   Solving for \( \delta_x \):
   \[
   \delta_x = -\beta \gamma c \tau_0 \ln(0.3)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \delta_x \approx -1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \times \ln(0.3) \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \times 1.20397 \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]

**Final Answer**:
The minimum resolution needed is \(\boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 the L such that 30% of particles decay by the time they've traveled L. Wait, no. If we consider the decay probability. To observe 30% decays, how far do we need to track. Alternatively, it's the L such that the probability to decay within L is 30%, which would require integrating up to L. But maybe the requirement is to have 30% of the decays occur, so 30% of all decays would be due to particles that decayed within their path length being equal or greater than the resolution. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the way to think about it is if the detector has spatial resolution delta_x, it can't distinguish two points closer than delta_x. Therefore, if a particle decays after a distance L that is shorter than delta_x, the detector can't resolve the decay vertex from the production vertex, and thus can't observe the decay. So in order to observe a decay, the decay must occur at a distance L > delta_x. Thus, the number of observable decays is N_obs = N_total * P(L > delta_x) = N_total * exp(-delta_x / (gamma beta c tau0)).

Therefore, in order to have N_obs / N_total = 0.3, we need exp(-delta_x / (gamma beta c tau0)) = 0.3. Solving for delta_x: delta_x = - gamma beta c tau0 * ln(0.3).

But wait, but wait. If the observed decays are those that happen at a distance greater than delta_x, because we can't see decays that happen too close. So, we need exp(-delta_x/(gamma beta c tau0))=0.3. Therefore delta_x >= -gamma beta c tau0 ln(0.3). Wait, hang on.

Let me clarify this carefully. Suppose we have a particle that lives for a certain time with exponential decay. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau0, and it's moving at speed v= beta c. The probability density for decaying at a time t is (1/(gamma tau0)) exp(-t/(gamma tau0)). The decay occurs at position x = v t.

Therefore, the probability that a decay occurs within a distance x from the production point is the same as the probability that the decay time is t = x/v. So the cumulative probability distribution function for x is P(X <= x) = 1 - exp(-x/(v gamma tau0)). Therefore, the probability that the decay occurs at a distance greater than x is P(X > x) = exp(-x/(v gamma tau0)).

If the detector cannot resolve the decay vertex if the decay occurs within x_min, then the probability to observe a decay is exp(-x_min/(v gamma tau0)). The problem states that we need to "observe at least 30% of the decays," so exp(-x_min/(v gamma tau0)) >= 0.3.

Solving for x_min: x_min <= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). Therefore, the required spatial resolution must satisfy:

x_min <= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3) to observe at least 30% of the decays.

But x_min here represents the minimum detectable decay length. So if our detector has a resolution delta_x, then we can detect decay lengths greater than delta_x. Hence, to observe 30% of the decays, we need delta_x <= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). Wait, no. To observe 30% of the decays, we need the fraction of decays with X > delta_x to be at least 0.3. Which implies exp(-delta_x/(v gamma tau0)) >=0.3.

Therefore, solving for delta_x: exp(-delta_x/(v gamma tau0)) >=0.3 => -delta_x/(v gamma tau0) >= ln(0.3) => delta_x <= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3)

So therefore, delta_x <= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). Therefore, the resolution must be at least (i.e., delta_x needs to be smaller than or equal to this value). Wait, but spatial resolution being "smaller than" what?

Wait, higher resolution corresponds to a smaller delta_x, the minimum distance that can be measured. So, in order to see decays that happened at a very small distance, you need a very high (good) resolution (small delta_x).

But in this problem, they ask for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, that would be the (delta_x)_min = -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). So the resolution needs to be smaller than or equal to this, right?

Wait no. Let me clarify:

If you have a spatial resolution of delta_x, then any decay occurring over a distance longer than delta_x can be resolved (i.e., detected as a decay), whereas decays occurring within delta_x cannot be distinguished from the primary vertex. So the number of observed decays would be proportional to the probability that the particle decays beyond delta_x: P(X > delta_x) = exp(-delta_x/(v gamma tau0)). So to have P(X > delta_x) = 30%, set exp(-delta_x/(v gamma tau0)) = 0.3, solve for delta_x = -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3).

Thus, delta_x is the distance at which if you can resolve that distance, you will see 30% of the decays. So the required spatial resolution is delta_x = -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). Therefore, this is the maximum spatial resolution required in order to be able to detect at least 30% of the decays.

Therefore, to find this delta_x, we must calculate v gamma tau0. But wait, combining with the previous quantities:

We have gamma ≈7.917, v=beta c=0.992c, tau0=8e-16 s. Let's compute the terms.

First, compute gamma * beta * c tau0. The product of these terms.

gamma=7.917, beta≈0.992, c≈3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

First, compute beta gamma: 7.917*0.992≈7.854

Next, c*tau0: 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s = 24e-8 m = 2.4e-7 m= 2.4e-4 mm= 0.24 micrometers.

But maybe convert units to meters.

Hold on, c is 3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s. So c*tau0=3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 meters. Then, beta gamma=7.854. So beta gamma c tau0=7.854 * 2.4e-7 m= 18.8496e-7 meters=1.88496e-6 meters=1.88496 microns. Then, multiplied by -ln(0.3). ln(0.3)= -1.20397, so -ln(0.3)=1.20397. Therefore, the resolution delta_x=1.88496e-6 m *1.20397≈2.2705e-6 m≈2.2705 microns≈2.27 micrometers.

Therefore, the spatial resolution must be at least approximately 2.27 micrometers in order to observe 30% of the decays.

But wait, isn't this a very small length? Is 2 microns achievable in bubble chambers? Hmm, not sure, but perhaps. Anyway, the problem is not about practicality, but calculation.

But wait, want to check the steps again for possible mistakes.

First, gamma=27 GeV / 3.41 GeV=7.917. Okay.

Beta=sqrt(1 - (m_x / E)^2)=sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2)=sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2)=sqrt(0.98407)=approx 0.992, correct.

Beta gamma= 7.917 *0.992≈7.854.

c=3e8 m/s.

Tau0=8e-16 s.

Therefore, beta gamma c tau0=7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s. Wait, hang on: units.

But c tau0 is 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-8 meters. So beta gamma *c tau0=beta gamma * c tau0.

Hold on, beta gamma c tau0= v/c gamma c tau0= gamma beta c tau0.

But no:

Since beta= v/c, so v= beta c. Therefore, decay length of particle is L= v tau_lab= beta c gamma tau0. So average decay L_avg= beta c gamma tau0. Therefore, speed quotient correct.

But yes, in our case, when calculating the quantity -beta gamma c tau0 ln(0.3):

v gamma tau0= beta c gamma tau0= beta gamma c tau0. Therefore:

- ln(0.3)*beta gamma c tau0.

Wait, so:

delta_x= - v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). Wait, hold up. So in the expression for P(X > delta_x)=exp(-delta_x/(v gamma tau0)), set to 0.3. So we have -delta_x/(v gamma tau0)=ln(0.3), so delta_x= -v gamma tau0 ln(0.3). So v is beta c. Therefore,

delta_x= - beta c gamma tau0 ln(0.3).

Given:

beta=0.992, gamma=7.917, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

Therefore,

beta c approx 0.992 *3e8≈2.976e8 m/s.

gamma tau0≈7.917 *8e-16≈6.3336e-15 s.

So, multiply these together:

beta c * gamma tau0≈2.976e8 m/s *6.3336e-15 s≈(2.976 *6.3336) e (8-15)≈18.85e-7 m≈1.885e-6 m. So 1.885 microns.

Then multiply by ln(0.3-1):

ln(0.3)= -1.20397, so negative of that is 1.20397. So:

delta_x≈1.885e-6 m *1.20397≈2.270e-6 meters≈2.27 microns.

So in meters, that's 2.27e-6 meters, or 2.27 micrometers.

Now, converting into more physics-appropriate units, maybe meters, centimeters, millimeters, or even nanometers, but micrometers seems correct here.

Thus, 2.27 micrometers.

But to answer the problem, should it be in meters, or centimeters? The answer might need to be in meters. The problem only says 'resolution' but doesn't specify units, but bubble chamber resolutions are typically in millimeters or centimeters. Hmm. However, from the calculation, it's around a couple of microns. This seems quite small, but given the very short lifetime of 8e-16 seconds, which even when the particle is moving at a high gamma factor, it's still covering a very small distance.

Double-checking if the calculation is correct. Let me compute all constants numerically.

First, given:

Gamma = 27 /3.41 ≈7.917259.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41^2 /27^2)) = sqrt(1 - (11.6281/729))=sqrt(1 - 0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.992. So beta is approx 0.992.

Holding more decimal places: better calculation:

(3.41)^2 = ?

3.41 *3.41:

3*3=9,

3*0.41=1.23,

0.41*3=1.23,

0.41*0.41=0.1681.

So 3.41*3.41= (3 +0.41)^2=9 + 2*1.23 + 0.1681= 9 + 2.46 +0.1681=11.6281.

So, 3.41²=11.6281 GeV²/c⁴.

Energy squared E² =27²=729 GeV²/c².

Thus, beta²=1 - (m² c⁴)/(E² c²) here?

Wait confusion between energy and momentum. Probably due to units.

Actually, remembering gamma= E/(m c²), beta = v/c= pc/(E), where p is momentum. So, E²=(pc)^2 + (m c²)^2

Which gives:

(pc)²= E² - (m c²)^2

But beta= (p c)/ (E)

Wait beta = (p c)/ E = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/E = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²))=sqrt(1 - (m c²/E )² ).

Yes. So if E and m are given in units of GeV, with c=1 in natural units. But perhaps that's causing confusion.

Wait, if we are working in natural units where c=1, then E (in GeV) equals gamma m (in GeV). Beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2). So making sense.

Since the mass is 3.41 GeV, and energy is27 GeV, so beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2)=sqrt(1 -0.01595)= same value.

Therefore, in natural units (c=1), distance is in GeV^{-1}, but here in the problem, we have SI units: c in m/s, tau0 in seconds.

But going back to the calculation, since c=3e8 m/s.

Another way to compute delta_x:

delta_x = - beta gamma c tau0 ln(0.3).

Plugging in the numbers:

beta =0.992,

gamma=7.917,

c=3e8 m/s,

tau0=8e-16 s,

ln(0.3)= -1.20397.

So,

0.992*7.917=7.854,

7.854 *3e8=2.356e9 (unit:m/s * s? Wait. Wait:

Wait, beta * gamma *c * tau0 * ln(0.3^{-1})).

Wait: . No:

beta*c*gamma*tau0 is:

(beta* c)*(gamma tau0 )

But beta*c is ~ 0.992*3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Gamma tau0 is ~7.917*8e-16 s ≈6.33e-15 s.

Multiplying these: 2.976e8 m/s *6.33e-15 s≈(2.976*6.33) e (8 -15)=18.85e-7 m≈1.885e-6 m= 1.885 microns.

Multiply by ln(1/0.3)=1.2039: 1.885 *1.2039≈2.27 microns. Correct.

Therefore, delta_x≈2.27 micrometers.

So, in meters, 2.27e-6 meters, which is 2.27 micrometers.

But whether this is the correct unit?

Bubble chambers typically have spatial resolutions on the order of 100 micrometers or so, so 2 microns seems like a very high resolution. But maybe in some cases, but perhaps the problem is designed to have this result. So probably correct.

But let me think: perhaps an order of magnitude check.

Given the proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. If the particle were at rest, it would decay in place. If it's moving at high speed, its lifetime is longer. Gamma 7.9 so lifetime in lab is about 8e-16 *8 =6.4e-15 seconds. Moving at 0.992c, so the distance is v t=0.992*3e8 *6.4e-15. That's about (0.992*3e8)*(6.4e-15)= 2.976e8 *6.4e-15≈1.90e-6 meters: the average decay length is approximately 1.9 microns. Therefore, this is the average distance, which jives with our previous calculation. Thus, observing 30% means that the cumulative probability beyond delta_x is 30%. Since the average is around 1.9 microns, but you need to see 30% decays. Since it's an exponential distribution, so the tail part. So if you take 30% of the decays, which are the ones with longer than average path lengths? No, the cumulative probability beyond L).

Wait, but according to the exponential distribution, only about exp(-1)≈37% survive past the mean. Wait, the mean is theta= beta gamma c tau0. The probability that x > theta: exp(-theta/theta)=exp(-1)≈0.367. So in our case, if delta_x= beta gamma c tau0, which is 1.9 microns, then only 36.7% would decay beyond that. But we need to reach 30%, we need a shorter delta_x so that 30% of the total It’s easier/more probable to have a decay after longer distances?, inversely. Wait no.

Actually for an exponential distribution, f(x) = (1/theta) e^{-x/theta} for x >=0. The survival function P(X >x) = e^{-x/theta}. theta= average. So if theta is average decay length (1.9 microns), than P(X> theta)=e^{-1}≈36.8%. So asking for 30% would correspond to x> delta_x where delta_x>theta.

Wait, e^{-x/theta}=0.3,

x= -theta ln0.3 ≈ theta*1.20397. Hmm our earlier result. So, x= theta * ln(1/0.3). Therefore, we have to have P(X > delta_x)=0.3, so exp{-delta_x/theta}=0.3 →delta_x= theta*ln(1/0.3)=approx theta*1.203.

Therefore, given that theta=1.885 microns then delta_x=1.885*1.203≈2.27 microns.

Therefore, our calculation is correct.

Therefore, about 2.27 µm is an accurate value.

So the minimum needed resolution is approximately 2.3 micrometers. But let's formalize the answer with precision.

Given:

gamma=27 /3.41≈7.917258739

beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41 /27)^2)≈sqrt(1 -0.01595)≈0.992027

v=beta c≈0.992027 *2.99792e8 m/s (since proper c=2.99792e8 m/s), approx 2.975e8 m/s).

gamma*tau0=7.917258739 *8e-16≈6.3338e-15 s.

Then, the decay length for 30% observation:

delta_x= -v * gamma tau0* ln(0.3)=?

Wait, no, delta_x= -beta*c* gamma tau0 * ln(0.3). Let's use exact calculations now.

delta_x= beta*gamma*c*tau0* ln(1/0.3)

Compute each part:

beta*gamma= (27 /3.41)/sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2) which, but we can use numbers above. We had beta≈0.992027, gamma≈7.91726.

beta*gamma≈ 0.992027 *7.91726≈7.85483.

tau0=8e-16 s

c=299792458 m/s, so using exact value for perhaps more precision.

Thus,

β*gamma*c*tau0* ln(1/0.3)

=7.85483 * 299792458 m/s *8e-16 s *1.20397

Calculating step by step:

First, beta*gamma*c*tau0=7.85483 *2.99792458e8 *8e-16≈First calculate 7.85483 *2.99792458e8:

7.85483 *2.99792458e8≈ approx 7.85 *3e8=2.355e9, subtract a bit. Alternatively, precise calculation:

7.85483 *2.99792458e8 =7.85483 *299792458= let's compute:

299792458 *7 =2,098,547,206,

299792458*0.8=239,833,966.4

299792458*0.05=14,989,622.9

299792458*0.00483=1,448,323.612, approx.

Adding all:

2,098,547,206 +

239,833,966.4 =2,338,381,172.4 +

14,989,622.9 =2,353,370,795.3 +

1,448,323.612≈2,354,819,118.91

So approx 2.354819e9.

Multiply by 8e-16:

2.354819e9 *8e-16=1.883855e-6 meters (since 1e9 *1e-16=1e-7, then *8 and 2.3548≈23.548*1e-7*8=?)

Wait 2.354819e9 *8e-16= (2.354819 *8)e (9-16)=18.83855e-7=1.883855e-6 meters.

So beta gamma c tau0≈1.883855e-6 meters.

Multiply by ln(1/0.3)=1.203972:

1.883855e-6 *1.203972≈1.883855*1.203972≈approx1.883855*1=1.883855, 1.883855*0.2=0.376771, 1.883855*0.003972≈0.00747. Sum these:1.883855 +0.376771≈2.2606 +0.00747≈2.268, from there≈2.268e-6 meters.

So delta_x≈2.268e-6 meters≈2.268 micrometers. So about 2.27 micrometers. Therefore, rounded to three significant figures, since given proper lifetime as 8e-16 s (1 sig fig?), wait given Mass to three sig figs (3.41 GeV), so, mass with 3, energy has two. Hmmm. Original data: tau0 is 8e-16: one significant figure, but noted as 8, so 8.0e-16? Next, energy is 27 GeV: two sig figs. If we're strict, the answer should be to two sig figs. so 2.3 micrometers. But since 30% is given as two sig figs as well, and 3.41 GeV is three sig figs.

But actually tau is given as 8e-16 which likely is one, making final answer would be uncertain. But in the problem, the presentation is sufficient for . From original problem: tau_0=8e-16 s, 27 GeV, 3.41 GeV. So at least three sig figs (from 3.41). In this case, perhaps providing delta_x≈2.27 micrometers.

But in having to do precise calculation, since with our detailed result we get 2.268e-6 m. The problem obviously would want the answer expressed as around 2.3 micrometers. Or maybe they expect answers in meters, with scientific notation. So then 2.27e-6 meters. Perhaps 2.3e-6 meters or 2.3 µm.

Alternatively, one might have a different approach if I use velocity in terms of exact beta and Gamma. But my results will not change. Therefore, finally, I think the answer is 2.3 micrometers minimum resolution needed.

**Final Answer**
The minimum resolution needed is \boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}.

But if our detector\'s resolution is less than this distance, we might miss a significant portion of the decays.\n\nWait, I need to relate the resolution to the probability of observing the decay. So the exponential decay law in terms of distance: the probability of decay occurring at a distance between L and L + dL is dP = (1/(gamma*v*tau0)) * exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) dL. Therefore, the cumulative probability up to distance L is P(L) = 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)).\n\nWe need 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) ≥ 0.3, so exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) ≤ 0.7.\n\nSo -L/(gamma*v*tau0) ≤ ln(0.7)\n=> L ≥ -gamma*v*tau0 * ln(0.7)\n\nBut since v = beta*c, gamma*v = gamma*beta*c, which is beta*gamma*c.

Not quite.\n\nWait, confusion arises here: The decay length probability a particle travels a distance L and decay. However, since the particles will be moving, they have a certain velocity. The lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau0, so they will have a decay length on average of gamma beta c tau0.\n\nHowever, when you solve for the probability of a particle decaying in a length L you get:\n\nIf they decay at some time t, then L = v t.

Since gamma = E / m (because E = gamma m c² and c=1)\n\nThus gamma = E / m_x = 27 /3.41 ≈7.916,\n\nthen beta is v/c, in this equation beta= sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²))≈sqrt(1- (1/62.673 ))=sqrt(≈0.984)=0.99198.\n\nYes, hence beta≈0.992.\n\nSo gamma*beta≈7.916*0.992≈~7.854.\n\nThen,\n\nL= -ln(0.7)* gamma*beta*c*tau0\n\nCompute -ln(0.7)=0.35667.\n\nGamma bet=7.854, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s\n\nCompute gamma*bet*c*tau0=7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=7.854 *24e-8 m= 188.496e-8 m=1.88496e-6 m≈1.885 micrometers.\n\nMultiply this by ln(0.7) negative reciprocate: but since L=0.35667 *1.885e-6≈0.673e-6 m=673 nanometers.\n\nHmm… so is the required resolution ~673 nm? But the decay length mean is ~1.88 micrometers.\n\nWait if the average decay length is 1.88 microns, and to observe 30% decays, the required L is smaller.\n\nBecause we need that the number of decays up to L is 30% of total.

That\'s 0.673 micrometers. That seems extremely tiny. Typical bubble chamber resolution is of order 50-100 microns (micrometers), which is 50-100e-6m. So in this case our resolution is less than the required 0.67 μm... which doesn\'t sound reasonable. That would be challenging as bubble chambers have a resolution in the range of micrometers (not nanometers).\n\nMaybe a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait: Wait if TAU0 is 8e-16 seconds.

Which is ~0.67 micrometers.\n\nThe problem says, "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays".\n\nThis could be interpreted as the typical required position resolution of the detector. If we need to resolve a track length L that corresponds to 30% decay probability. For 30% of the particles to decay, their decay vertex has to be a distance from the origin along the path.

If we compute that the average path length is L_avg=gamma beta c tau0≈1.88 microns. To have 30% of the decays, noticed that the required decay length L30 satisfies P(L30)=30%, so L30= -gamma beta c tau0 * ln(0.7)=0.3567*L_avg≈ roughly a third of the average.\n\nBut L=0.673μm is ~670 nm.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the \(X^0\) particle, we start by considering the relativistic effects on the particle's lifetime and decay length. 

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)) and velocity (\(\beta\))**:
   - Given the total energy \(E = 27 \, \text{GeV}\) and rest mass \(m_X = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}\), we find:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{E}{m_X} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917
     \]
   - The velocity factor \(\beta\) is:
     \[
     \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m_X}{E}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3.41}{27}\right)^2} \approx 0.992
     \]

2. **Calculate the mean decay length in the lab frame**:
   - The proper lifetime \(\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}\).
   - The mean decay length \(L_{\text{avg}}\) is given by:
     \[
     L_{\text{avg}} = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     L_{\text{avg}} \approx 7.917 \times 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (1.885 \, \mu\text{m})
     \]

3. **Determine the required resolution for 30% decay probability**:
   - The probability of decay within distance \(L\) is \(1 - \exp(-L / L_{\text{avg}})\). For 30% probability:
     \[
     1 - \exp\left(-\frac{L}{L_{\text{avg}}}\right) \geq 0.3
     \]
   - Solving for \(L\):
     \[
     \exp\left(-\frac{L}{L_{\text{avg}}}\right) \leq 0.7 \implies -\frac{L}{L_{\text{avg}}} \leq \ln(0.7) \implies L \geq -L_{\text{avg}} \ln(0.7)
     \]
   - Substituting \(\ln(0.7) \approx -0.3567\) and \(L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}\):
     \[
     L \geq 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \times 0.3567 \approx 6.73 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \, (0.673 \, \mu\text{m})
     \]

The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \boxed{6.7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 The speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s.

But tau0 is given as 8e-16 s, so beta*gamma*c*tau0:

=7.854 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s
=7.854 * 3*8 * 1e8 *1e-16
=7.854 *24 * 1e-8
=188.496e-8 m
=1.88496e-6 m, which is 1.88 micrometers.

But the problem is asking for the minimum spatial resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The mean decay length is L_avg = beta*gamma*c*tau0 = approximately 1.88 micrometers. But if our detector's resolution is less than this distance, we might miss a significant portion of the decays.

Wait, I need to relate the resolution to the probability of observing the decay. So the exponential decay law in terms of distance: the probability of decay occurring at a distance between L and L + dL is dP = (1/(gamma*v*tau0)) * exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) dL. Therefore, the cumulative probability up to distance L is P(L) = 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)).

We need 1 - exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) ≥ 0.3, so exp(-L/(gamma*v*tau0)) ≤ 0.7.

So -L/(gamma*v*tau0) ≤ ln(0.7)
=> L ≥ -gamma*v*tau0 * ln(0.7)

But since v = beta*c, gamma*v = gamma*beta*c, which is beta*gamma*c. Wait, we have a proper lifetime tau0, so the mean decay length is gamma*beta*c*tau0. Thus, the factor in the exponential is L / (gamma*beta*c*tau0)

Alternatively, going back with details: the lifetime in lab frame is gamma*tau0, so decay length in lab is gamma * tau0 * v, which is gamma * tau0 * beta * c.

Thus substituting into P(L) gives:

P(L) = 1 - exp(-L/(gamma beta c tau0)) ) ? Not quite.

Wait, confusion arises here: The decay length probability a particle travels a distance L and decay. However, since the particles will be moving, they have a certain velocity. The lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau0, so they will have a decay length on average of gamma beta c tau0.

However, when you solve for the probability of a particle decaying in a length L you get:

If they decay at some time t, then L = v t. The cumulative probability up to time t is 1 - exp(-t / (gamma tau0)), so replacing t = L / (v):

=1 - exp( - L / (gamma v tau0) )

But gamma v = gamma beta c. So:

1 - exp(- L / (gamma beta c tau0))

Therefore, to get 30%, set:

exp(- L/(gamma beta c tau0)) = 0.7

Take natural logarithm both sides:

- L/(gamma beta c tau0 )= ln(0.7)

Therefore:

L= - ln(0.7)* gamma beta c tau0

Now, calculate L:

First gamma = E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917

Beta from gamma:

beta = sqrt(1 -1/gamma²)≈ sqrt(1 -1/7.917²) ≈ sqrt(1 -1/62.68)=sqrt(≈0.984)≈ 0.992

From beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2/E^2))= similar.

Gamma beta=7.917 *0.992≈7.854

Dark k value: ln(0.7)≈-0.3567

Wait, but as L is supposed to be the distance, so:

L = (-ln(0.7)) * gamma beta c tau0 ≈ (0.3567) * 7.854 * c * 8e-16 s

c is 3e8 m/s, so:

0.3567 *7.854≈2.803

So 2.803 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s:

Calculate:

2.803 *3e8 *8e-16 =2.803*24e-8=67.272e-8 m=6.7272e-7 m. Which is approximately 6.73e-7 meters or 0.673 micrometers (673 nanometers).

But this seems very small. Check calculations step by step.

Compute gamma: 27 /3.41 ≈7.9161

Beta: Since beta² = 1 - (m/E)/gamma². Wait, beta is sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)), but m is rest mass and E is total energy. Wait no:

If X^0 is moving with total energy 27 GeV, and its rest mass is 3.41 GeV then gamma can be calculated as:

gamma = E/(m c^{2}) but since in particle physics units where c=1, then gamma = E/m =27 /3.41 ≈7.916.

Hence beta = sqrt(1 - (m/(gamma E))).

Wait, Wait. Since gamma = E / m (because E = gamma m c² and c=1)

Thus gamma = E / m_x = 27 /3.41 ≈7.916,

then beta is v/c, in this equation beta= sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²))≈sqrt(1- (1/62.673 ))=sqrt(≈0.984)=0.99198.

Yes, hence beta≈0.992.

So gamma*beta≈7.916*0.992≈~7.854.

Then,

L= -ln(0.7)* gamma*beta*c*tau0

Compute -ln(0.7)=0.35667.

Gamma bet=7.854, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s

Compute gamma*bet*c*tau0=7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=7.854 *24e-8 m= 188.496e-8 m=1.88496e-6 m≈1.885 micrometers.

Multiply this by ln(0.7) negative reciprocate: but since L=0.35667 *1.885e-6≈0.673e-6 m=673 nanometers.

Hmm… so is the required resolution ~673 nm? But the decay length mean is ~1.88 micrometers.

Wait if the average decay length is 1.88 microns, and to observe 30% decays, the required L is smaller.

Because we need that the number of decays up to L is 30% of total. Since lifetime follows exponential decay, the required L is shorter than the average.

Hence, the calculation gives 673 nanometers.

But bubble chambers often have spatial resolutions on the order of millimeters or microns, but this is asking perhaps for a very high resolution?

Could multiple the natural math:

gamma=27/3.41=7.917 approx.

beta ≈0.992

Then L = 0.3567 *7.917*0.992 *c *8e-16

Wait perhaps I made a confusion:

Wait formula:

L = ( -ln(0.7) ) * gamma * beta * c * tau0

So breaking down:

Gamma =7.917, beta=0.992, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s,

So the term gamma * beta * c * tau0 is the mean decay length?

Exactly: L_mean= gamma beta c tau0 \approx1.884e-6 m as calculated.

Then multiplying by 0.3567 gives L=0.3567*1.884e-6≈6.730e-7 m or 0.673 micrometers, approximately.

So spatial resolution needed is 673 nm. That's 0.673 micrometers. That seems extremely tiny. Typical bubble chamber resolution is of order 50-100 microns (micrometers), which is 50-100e-6m. So in this case our resolution is less than the required 0.67 μm... which doesn't sound reasonable. That would be challenging as bubble chambers have a resolution in the range of micrometers (not nanometers).

Maybe a mistake in calculations.

Wait: Wait if TAU0 is 8e-16 seconds. Gamma * tau0 = 8. here, seems far too small.

Wait in calculated gamma * beta is 7.854, which when multiplied by c tau0 is 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s => 24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

So L=7.854 *2.4e-7 m ≈1.88e-6 m : same as before.

But integrating up to 30% gives about 0.3567*1.88e-6 ≈6.73e-7 m. Which is ~0.67 micrometers.

The problem says, "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays".

This could be interpreted as the typical required position resolution of the detector. If we need to resolve a track length L that corresponds to 30% decay probability. For 30% of the particles to decay, their decay vertex has to be a distance from the origin along the path. So in order to detect decays, the detector must be able to resolve (i.e., distinguish) such a displacement twice in position due to tracks; perhaps what's the necessary spatial resolution so that in 30% of the events have a displaced vertex which can be distinguished from the original production point.

Alternatively, perhaps the "resolution" refers to the minimum distance between two points that can be measured. To observe a decay, you need to see a secondary vertex separated from the production vertex. So the minimum required resolution delta_x would have to be approximately the decay length such that a fraction f (30%) of decays produce vertices separated by at least delta_x. Given the decay probability is 30%, so solving delta_x ≈-c*tau_lab*ln(0.7). Therefore maybe.

But in reality, dealing with some confusion here between probability of decay to occur before a certain distance and detector resolving that distance.

Perhaps the original answer is more precise. If we compute that the average path length is L_avg=gamma beta c tau0≈1.88 microns. To have 30% of the decays, noticed that the required decay length L30 satisfies P(L30)=30%, so L30= -gamma beta c tau0 * ln(0.7)=0.3567*L_avg≈ roughly a third of the average.

But L=0.673μm is ~670 nm. That would require quite a high resolution. Since bubble chambers can have resolutions down to tens of micrometers (50-100 μm as per literature maybe), but perhaps not micron or submicron.

Possibility that I messed up units. Let's check again.

Proceeding step by step:

1. Given:

Proper lifetime tau0=8e-16 seconds

Energy of X0 is 27 GeV, mass is 3.41 GeV.

Calculate gamma:

Since in natural units (c=1), gamma=E/m=27/3.41≈7.916.

beta=sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2)=sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2)=sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2)=sqrt(1 -0.016)=sqrt(0.984)=approx 0.992.

Therefore, gamma=7.916, beta=0.992. Beta-gamma=7.854.

Then, the decay length quadratic:

lambda=gamma beta c tau0=7.854*(3e8 m/s)*(8e-16 s)=7.854*3*8*1e-8 meters.

Compute numeric terms:

7.854*24=188.5, then 188.5e-8=1.885e-6 m=1.885 micrometers.

So average decay length is ~1.885 micrometers.

The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of decays.

Thirty percent of decays is not 30% of the average decay length but the point where 30% have decayed.

Now, cumulative probability is exponential:

P(L)=1-exp(-L/lambda)
SET 1 - exp(-L/lambda) ≥0.3 … Which leads to exp(-L/lambda) <=0.7

Therefore:

-L/lambda >= ln(0.7)

But this becomes:

L >= -lambda * ln(0.7)

But lambda=1.885e-6 m so,

L= - ln(0.7)*1.885e-6 m ≈0.3567*1.885e-6≈0.673e-6 m≈673 nm.

Therefore, the minimum resolution requirement is around 673 nanometers. That suggests that the detector must resolve distances on the order of ~0.67 micrometers. However, bubble chambers' spatial resolution at best was in the 10s of micrometers. For instance, if the spatial resolution is about 10 micrometers, you couldn't see events with displacement much smaller than that. Hence how to observe a decay with displacement 0.6 micrometer?

Either the problem presents numbers leading to this conclusion regardless of reality, which demands the answer to be approximately 0.67 micrometers, converted to units possibly with exponents arranged correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps we messing up the lab frame calculation.

Wait, actually, might there be another approach? The resonant mean decay length is lambda=gamma * beta * c * tau0. However, for detection, we need to determine over which path you can detect the decay. If the detector can't resolve distances smaller than some delta_x, then all decays which happened within delta_x would be indistinguishable from non-decay.

Alternatively, perhaps they model the resolution as being the minimal displacement needed to identify a decay into two tracks (Y+ and Z-). So observed decay length L must be enough to physically be detected. To detect the decay, the displaced vertex must be distinguishable from the primary vertex, depending on resolution.

If resolution is delta_x, then decays occurring within distance delta_x won't be detected; the number of observed decays is N_obs = N_total*(1 - exp(-delta_x/(gamma beta c tau0)))

Therefore to have N_obs/N_total >=0.3, set:

1 - exp(-delta_x/lambda)>=0.3; rearranged, delta_x <= -lambda * ln(0.7) Similarly then.

But this would answer the same as above, delta_x >= ~0.67 micrometers.

But given previous terms, the required minimum resolution is ~0.67 micrometers to observe at least 30% of the decays. Which would require the resolution better than one micron. But as bubble chambers had resolutions of about 10e-6 m (10 micrometers), this is not sure feasible. If given con algebra is rights, maybe the problem-mi计算的答案正确吗？

仔细思考，对于概率的知识是否正确：

衰减概率为至少30%，对应的不仅仅是平均自由程的某一部分。相反，P(L) = 1 - e^{-L/λ}。要满足概率>=30%，解得L >= -λ ln(0.7)

用正确的数值代入给出：λ ≈1.88 micrometers (gamma beta c tau0), 那么L >=0.3567 *1.88 micrometers≈0.67 micrometers.

因此，最低分辨需要约0.67微米。然而这可能与现实中气泡室的分辨率不符，可能问题中存在单位转换错误哦?

仔细检查单位转换：

tau0是8e-16秒，乘以光速，三者为：gamma beta c tau0。

将tau0转为秒，所以光速是3e8米/秒。gamma beta等于7.854。总：gamma beta c tau0=7.854*(3e8 m/s)*8e-16 s=7.854*24e-8 m=1.884e-6 m=1.884 微米。

是否正确？没错。然后，考虑达到30%的概率需要的距离约为该值的0.3567倍，故为约0.67微米.

所以最终答案是0.67微米或者6.7e-7米，用科学记数法书写可能更方便。应该是比如用约673 nanometers或者0.673微米表示。根据问题要求，可能需要转换为米或其他单位。

如果是填空题的话，应提交的是以米为单位的科学记数法，比如6.73×10^-7米，或者如果考虑保留两位有效数字的话可能是6.7×10^-7米，或者说成0.67微米。

也可能问题中希望用τ_0×gamma或者别的，但我认为这里的推导正确。

最终确认一遍：

1. 用于L≥-lambda*ln(0.7)计算是否合理？是的，如前面所得。

2. 此处坏单位正确转换为米吗？是的：3e8 m/s乘8e-16秒得到的是2.4e-8米每次gamma*beta项=7.854，得到总平均距离是1.884e-6米.

1. Gamma beta正确，自然对数计算正确。是的.

综上：正确的resolution应为约6.7×10^-7米，即6.7e-7米或者0.67微米。


**Final Answer**
The minimum resolution needed is \boxed{6.7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}}.

But perhaps the particle goes a distance L, so the cumulative probability of decaying up to L is 30%, so the detector resolution should be capable of resolving to that L.\n\nThe target L is such that P(decay < L) = 0.3, find L. Solving 1 - exp(-L/(gamma v tau0)) = 0.3 implies L = -gamma v tau0 ln(0.7). So, replacement needed.\n\nHere, natural logarithm of 0.7 is approximately -0.3567, hence L ≈ gamma v tau0 * 0.3567. Therefore, plug in numbers.\n\nBreaking points:\n\nFirst compute gamma: 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me compute that precisely:\n\ngamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9155. So, γ≈7.9155.\n\nThen, beta from γ: beta = sqrt(1 - (m_x^2 / E^2)) where E is energy. But given that E is the total energy (which is γ m). But However, the velocity can be found as (pc^2)/E, where p is the particle\'s momentum. Since E² = (pc)^2 c² + (m c²)^2 => (pc)² = (E² - m² c^4)/c². Therefore, pc = sqrt(E² - m²) in units where c=1.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to calculate beta as sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2):\n\nIn Natural units (where c=1), beta = p / E where p is sqrt(E² - m²), thus beta = sqrt(1 - m² / E²). For us, m_X = 3.41 GeV, E =27 GeV. So:\n\nbeta = sqrt(1 - (3.41 / 27)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.01594) = sqrt(0.98406) ≈ 0.992. So, beta ≈ 0.992. So velocity is 0.992c, therefore.\n\nThus, beta γ ≈ 7.9155 * 0.992 ≈ 7.85. But actually, combining m and E. Alternatively, consider exact calculation of beta gamma.\n\nAnother approach: beta gamma is proportional to momentum/m. Since gamma beta = E beta / (m c^2) if we\'re using E total energy. Wait, let\'s compute βγ, which can sometimes be expressed via momentum. For a particle, the momentum p is γ β m. So βγ = p/m. The energy E is γ m. Thus p = sqrt(E² - m²). So βγ = sqrt(E² - m²)/m = sqrt( (27^2 - 3.41^2) )/3.41. Let\'s compute that:\n\n27^2 = 729, 3.41 squared = approximately 11.6281. Then,\n\nsqrt(729 - 11.6281) = sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.783 GeV. Thus βγ ≈ 26.783 / 3.41 ≈7.85 in line with previous estimate. So, yes.\n\nTherefore, beta gamma is approximately 7.85. However, the gamma itself was approximately 7.9155, which isn\'t critical unless needed with precision.\n\nGiven that Gamma (as standard notation) is 7.9155, so L is Gamma * beta * c * tau0 * (-ln(0.7)).\n\nTau0 in proper frame is 8e-16 seconds.\n\nThen, first compute Gamma * beta: 7.9155 * 0.992≈7.85( as before)\n\nBut since Lorentz factor Gamma is γ=7.9155, and β=0.992, combination gives Gamma*beta =7.9155*0.992≈7.85.\n\nGiven c=3e8 m/s.\n\nSo, then L is Gamma*beta*c*tau0*0.3567 (because -ln(0.7)≈0.3567).\n\nWait: L= Gamma beta c tau0 * (-ln(1 -0.3))= (beta gamma c) tau0 * (-ln(0.7)).\n\nGiven that and values:\n\nbeta gamma≈7.85, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 seconds. So:\n\ncompute (7.85)*(3e8 m/s)*(8e-16 s)*0.3567.\n\nWait let\'s compute step-by-step.\n\nFirst, beta gamma * c: 7.85 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.355e9 m/s.\n\nWait: Wait beta gamma is ((beta gamma)=7.85), but beta gamma multiplied by c gives (beta gamma c) is then 7.85 *3e8 m/s.\n\nBut actually, the relation:\n\nIn natural units c=1, but here in SI:\n\nL = (beta gamma c) tau0 (exponent factor -ln(1-0.3))\n\nBut if we keep beta gamma as Gamma times beta, since it\'s calculated correctly. Exact formula:\n\nL = beta gamma * c * tau0 * (-ln(0.7))\n\nSo, calculating beta gamma since beta gamma=7.85 as above.\n\nYes.\n\nHence:\n\n7.85 * c * tau0 * (-ln(0.7)).\n\nCompute step-by-step. Let\'s multiply numbers:\n\nFirst, take L = 7.85 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s * (-ln(0.7)).\n\nFirst, 7.85*3e8=2.355e9\n\nMultiply by 8e-16: 2.355e9 *8e-16 =1.884e-6\n\nMultiply by -ln(0.7) ~0.3567: 1.884e-6 *0.3567 ≈6.7216e-7 m, that\'s meters.\n\nSo, 6.7216e-7 meters ≈ 672.16e-9 m ≈672 nanometers.\n\nBut a partile physics experiment wouldn\'t really use nm. If correctly, perhaps converting this into centimeters:\n\nSince 1 m =100 cm, so 6.7216e-7 m =6.7216e-5 cm =0.000067216 cm=approximately6.7216e-5 cm.\n\nBut 1 micrometer (micron)=1e-6 meters. So the result in micrometers is 0.6721 micrometers ~0.67 microns. However, how reasonable is this?\n\nGiven time scale of 8e-16 seconds and gamma ~8, with velocity near 3e8 m/s *0.992. Decay time tau= gamma tau0≈7.9e-15 seconds. So distance traveled during this time is beta c gamma tau0=0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s≈2.38e-8 meters. Wait, but we ended up earlier with 670 nm which is bigger. So perhaps mistake.\n\nWait. Please make clarifications.\n\nWait, in order to have detected decays, the position where the decay occurs needs to be discernible.\n\nIf decaying particles are produced in trackers, then live for certain time and decay into other charged particles. The length between production and decay, called decay length, must be distinguishable from zero (the production point). Hence, the precision of the detector. If the decay occurs within the resolution, you can\'t distinguish the decay products as displaced from the production point, so you wouldn\'t see the decay. Hence, to observe 30% of decays, the uncertainty/resolution must be less than that distance which 30% of the decay lengths exceed. Wait, need clarify: to observe 30% of the decays, beyond a threshold Lmin, the probability someone can observe is when decay occurs at a distance L > Lres (resolution), you can detect. So maybe variance-> something else here.\n\nAlternatively, total cross-section and so on. Or:\n\nAssuming any decay is visible if occurs at a distance L larger than the resolution delta. So, the probability to decay with L^>delta is exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau0)). Wait, not quite. The decay probability distribution is P(L) dL = (1/(beta gamma c tau0)) exp( -L / (beta gamma c tau0) ) dL. Hence, integrated probability from L=delta to infinity is exp( -delta / (beta gamma c tau0) ). To observe at least 30%, need this exponentialsult must be at least 0.3. Thus,\n\nexp( -delta / ( )) =0.3,\n\nwhich gives delta / (beta gamma c tau0) = -ln(0.3)=1.20397\n\nHence,\n\ndelta= beta gamma c tau0 *1.20397≈( computed βγ c tau0) *1.20397\n\nBut let me comprehend, "to observe at least 30% of the decays," the wording is ambiguous.\n\nEither:\n\nProbability to decay beyond the resolution distance, and hence the track is long enough to detect, which is 30%; so the probability of longer track than delta equals 30%, meaning delta is such that exp( - delta / <L> )=0.3. Thus delta= - <L> ln( 0.3 )= tau mean path *1.2= larger delta.\n\nAlternatively, observation of 30% decay could be understood as 30% of the particles decaying in a way that the decay is distinguishable. If the detector has resolution delta, then decay lengths above delta can be detected, and below cannot.\n\nBut perhaps the correct understanding is，Suppose that the detector can only detect decay vertices if the decay occurs at a distance greater than delta from the production point. Then the fraction detected is exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau0)). But to "observe at least 30% of the decays", this would require exp(-delta/(...)) <= 0.7 ? Wait no:Total decays should be adjusted. Wait, no.\n\nActually expect:\n\nNumber of decays detected is proportional to the number of decay vertices with displacement >delta. But initially, the number of decays depends on survival probability. Wait, this is confusing standard proportions.\n\nThe Particle Physics book formulae:\n\nThe number of decays N observed with displaced vertices greater than delta is N =N_0 *exp( - delta/(gamma beta c tau0) )\n\nBut this seems incorrect. Actually, no. Let\'s reevaluate.\n\nLifetime distribution:\n\nThe probability that the particle decays at length L is dP/dL = (1/(gamma beta c tau0)) exp(-L/(gamma beta c tau0))\n\nThus, the probability that decay occurs at L>delta is the integral from L= delta to infinity: = exp( - delta/(gamma beta c tau0))\n\nHence, this is the probability of a decay occurring at distance L>delta. So, if we have a detector with resolution delta, events with L>delta can be observed as displaced vertices. Then the problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays, so:\n\nexp(-delta / (gamma beta c tau0)) >=0.3\n\nBecause the observed fraction is the longer decay paths. Hence:\n\nfor which solving for delta:\n\ndelta <= gamma beta c tau0 (- ln0.3) /1≈gamma beta c tau0 *1.20397...\n\nBut the phrasing in the problem is "observe at least 30% of the decays". So if the resonance can only detect decays with L>delta, the fraction observed is F= exp(-delta/(gamma beta c tau0)) So F=remaining fraction: Want F≈0.3. So in order to have at least 30% detected, delta needs to be such that:\n\ndelta<= gamma beta c tau0 * (-ln(F))=gamma beta c tau0 * (- ln(0.3))≈gamma beta c tau0 *1.20397\n\nThis would give the maximum delta (resolution) (assuming resolutions lower than delta >>lower delta?)\n\nWait, the maximum delta since when delta is smaller, more small decay lengths are detected. Ah, inversely. If a detector\'s position resolution is delta, decay vertices closer than delta would not be resolved but perhaps seen as merged with the primary vertex. Hence, particles decaying within delta of the primary vertex would go undetected. Thus, detected fraction is:\n\n1 - integral from L=0 to delta of dP/dL dL = exp(-delta/(gamma beta c tau0)).\n\nTherefore, the detected fraction is N/N0=exp(-delta / (gamma beta c tau0)). To have N/N0 >=0.3, therefore:\n\nexp(-delta / (gamma beta c tau0)) >=0.3 ---> so delta <= gamma beta c tau0*(- ln0.3) ... which is delta <= gamma beta c tau0 *1.20397. \n\nHence, the required resolution delta is less than or equal to gamma beta c tau0 *1.20397. So the MINUMUM resolution necessary (best possible resolution) would correspond to delta = gamma beta c tau0*1.20397. The resolution is the smallest delta which allows 30% to be observed, but problem says "minimum resolution" needed to observe at at least 30%. Hmmm.\n\nWait, But in reality, if resolution is worse (bigger delta), this effective fine delta means you can\'t see vertices closer than delta. So okay, resolvingPower is inversely related. So the minimal resolution required is actually this threshold.\n\nWait Forgotten for a moment. Let me think in clearer terms. Let\'s pretend Delta is the resolution of the detector. If Delta is quite big (like 1 meter), then only particles that decay after traveling a meter would be observed as decays. If Delta is very small (smaller than an average decay length), then most decays would be observed.\n\nBut in inverse: the detector\'s resolution affecting its ability to distinguish decay vertices.\n\nTherefore, decay length L. If the particle decays very close to the production point (at delta << L), then the decay can\'t be resolved and is not observed. Therefore, the number of resolvable decays would be those that decay beyond L=Delta.\n\nThe number of such decays is N =N_0 * exp( -Delta/( | \n\nBut from differential decay probability:\n\ndN/dL = N_0/(L_mean) exp(-L/L_mean}\n\nWhere L_mean= gamma beta c tau0\n\nThen, the number decays beyond Delta is Int_{L=Delta}^\\infty dN/dL dL = N_0 *exp(-Delta/L_mean)\n\nSo yes, the detected fraction is exp(-Delta / L_mean). To have at least 30% (N/N0 >=0.3), we need:\n\nexp(-Delta/L_mean)>=0.3 --> -Delta/L_mean >= ln(0.3) -->Delta <= - L_mean ln(0.3)≈L_mean *1.20397\n\nTherefore, Delta <= L_mean *1.20397. Hence, about 1.2 times the mean decay length. But where L_mean=gamma beta c tau0≈7.85 *3e8m/s *8e-16s\n\nCompute L_mean:\n\ngamma beta=7.85\n\nc=3e8 m/s\n\ntau0=8e-16 s\n\nL_mean=7.85 *3e8 *8e-16≈7.85*24e-8=approx 189e-8 m=1.89e-6 meters=1.89 micrometers.\n\nTherefore，was earlier computation.\n\nThus, resolution length needed for critical value is:\n\nDelta_max=1.20397*1.89e-6 m≈2.275e-6 m≈2.275 micrometers.\n\nTherefore, L_mean≈1.89e-6 m and Delta between this required exceeds L avg explanation:\n\nwait, perhaps I messed mean (L_mean) is average decay path. Meaning that individual decay happen on average around μ=1.89e-6 m, 1.89 micrometers.\n\nBut a detector must resolve at least: ... Remember, the critical Delta that permits us to see just 30% of the decays. Therefore the required resolution would be to set Delta approx≈2.28 micrometers (for little over two microns). Wait, wait but calculation says to have Delta= 1.20*L_mean (approx).\n\nAlternate approach:\n\nGiven l_mean=gamma * beta *c*tau0= (8e-16 s) * (0.992c) c= speed of light.\n\nWait gamma= E/m ≈27/3.41=7.915.\n\nBeta= sqrt(1−m²/E²)=sqrt(1−(3.41/27)^2)≈sqrt(1−(0.1263)^2)= approx 0.992.\n\nTherefore, l_mean= beta * gamma * c * tau0≈7.915 *0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.\n\n→Calculate this:\n\nbetaγ=approx 7.85, as before. So,\n\n7.85 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.355e9 m/s.\n\nMultiply by 8e-16 s:\n\n2.355e9 *8e-16≈1.884e-6 meters ≈1.884 micrometers.\n\nThus, mean decay length is ~1.88 micrometers. To find the resolution to detect >=30%, we need:\n\nexp(-Delta/l_mean)=0.3\n\nThus,\n\nDelta= -l_mean * ln(0.3)=1.88μm *1.203.≈2.265 micrometers, or ~2.27 microns.\n\nSo, needed resolution is approximately 2.27 micrometers（2.27 microns.\n\nConsidering that experimentally, this is plausible scale for a bubble chamber\'s resolution?\n\nBut wait, in bubble chambers, resolution can be limited by bubble size. As per knowledge, the resolution may vary, but typically on the order of 50-100 microns may be reported. Not sure, but if so the here ~2-3 microns may be beyond available resolution. But of course this depends on the conditions. Possibly, signifies original question wants calculation（rather than experiment check).\n\nAlternatively, the problem says: speciically, what minimum resolution is required (i.e., maximum delta) to "observe 30%". Right, but if we must observe at least 30%, so...\n\nThe probability of a decay happening beyond a certain distanceDelta is p= exp(−Delta / L_mean). For p>=0.3, implying exp(−Delta / L_mean) >=0.3.\n\nThus, log(p)>=log(0.3)\n\nmult both sides by -1. Inequality flips:\n\n(Delta/L_mean) <= -log(0.3) => Delta <= L_mean*(-log(0.3))=approx 1.203* L_mean=1.203*1.88mu=2.26 mu.\n\nThus, the maximum allowable Delta is ~2.26micrometers, to that ensure that N_obs=0.3. So I need to invert:\n\nIf the delta is 2.26 microns, then fluctuation allows some decays below this to be detected? Alternatively, it\'s more a probabilistic approach. OK, regardless, question is.\n\nSo per logic, structured as:\n\n- Correctly compute gamma=E/m=27 GeV /3.41 \u202fGeV ≈7.915.\n\n- β= sqrt(1-(m/E)^2) ≈0.992.\n\n- verified βγ≈7.85.\n\n- Calculated c*τ0*βγ= decay length mean ≈1.88e-6m=1.88 mi microns.\n\n- For 30% observation, resolution required is delta=-L_mean * ln(0.3)≈1.88*1.203≈~2.26 microns.\n\nBut in proper units expressed.\n\nNow converting to feasibility。For more precise answer.\n\nCalculations a bit more accurately:\n\nGamma=27 /3.41= it’s 27÷3.41.\n\nLet me compute Gamma per exact calculation：\n\n3.41 *7=23.  first.\n\nSo，7*3.41=23.87.\n\nWrong, 3.41*7=23.87.\n\nBut 27 /3.41 is bigger: 27 -23.87=3.13 remaining.\n\nTherefore, approx 7 +3.13/(3.41) =7. +0.917≈7.917.\n\nThus, gamma≈7.917.\n\nBetaγ now.\n\nTo compute beta precisely:\n\nWe need the velocity, beta = sqrt(1-(m_X/E)^2), with m_X=3.41 GeV and E=27 GeV.(assuming it\'s not in units where c=1).\n\nComplications? MILDLY.\n\nIf units are relativistic (GeV energy, GeV/c² mass:\n\nGIVEN total energy E=γ m c² →γ=E/(mc²). Wait in units where c=1, but when line in CERN LHC physics, E_rest= m: But here energy equais sumtotal. But simplifying: Assume units where c=1.\n\nMass is m_x=3.41 GeV/c²? If E is 27 GeV, then γ= E/(m_x c²) (m_xc² is rest energy). Suppose answer in GeV-based units. That would be gamma=E/(m_x). So expectedly=27 / 3.41= ~7.917.\n\nImportant aspect to take.\n\nBeta calculation:\n\nif E_tot = gamma m, as we have. Then：\n\ngamma = 7.917 (approx)\n\nGiven that gamma=1/sqrt(1- beta^2), swapping for beta:\n\nbeta= sqrt( 1 - 1/gamma^2 )≈sqrt(1-1/(7.917^2))≈sqrt(1-0.016)≈sqrt(0.984)= approx 0.992.\n\nExhaustively:\n\ngamma squared is (7.917)^2=62.678.\n\nThus,\n\n1/gamma²≈0.01594.\n\nThen,\n\n1-1/gamma²≈0.98406, sqrt is approx 0.992.\n\nThus, beta indeed≈0.992.\n\nThen beta gamma≈7.917×0.992≈7.853.\n\nCalculation:\n\n7.917 ×0.992= 7.917*(1-0.008)=7.917 -7.917*0.008.\n\n7.917* 0.008=0.063336.\n\nTherefore，7.917 -0.0633≈7.853≈7.85.\n\nThus BETA gamma≈7.85.\n\nThus, now proceed with seconds and meters。\n\nFirst tau0=8e-16 s.\n\nThe mean decay length: gamma beta c tau0= βγ c τ0.\n\nβgamma ~7.85, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.\n\nThus, L_mean=7.85*3e8*8e-16= let\'s calculate：\n\n7.85*3 *8 =188.4, times e8*e-16=e-8.\n\nThus， L=188.4e-8 meters =1.884e-6 meters=1.884 micrometers.\n\nTauNext, for a observation of at least 30% of decay: probability P= exp(-delta/L_mean)=1-0.3=0.7? No.\n\nWait in currenttimes, if you want to detect at least 30% of the decays (fraction detectExtra).\nActually much back and forth here: bridge closing.\n\nAs derived, the number of detected decays is the integral over all decay lengths where L>delta, leading to propability=exp(-delta/L_mean). To have at least 30% detection efficient:\n\nexp(-delta/L_mean) >=0.3 ---> this requires delta <= L_mean*(-ln 0.3)=1.203* L_mean。\n\nThus, delta_max=1.203*1.884= 2.267 micrometers.\n\nThat would be approximately 2.27 micrometers. Hence, the minimum resolution (maximum allowed delta) would need to maior reside a value not exceeding approximately 2.27 micrometers.\n\nBut the problem specifies "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays".

To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we need to consider the relativistic effects on the particle's lifetime and decay length. 

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m_X} = \frac{27 \, \text{GeV}}{3.41 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 7.915
   \]

2. **Calculate the velocity factor (\(\beta\))**:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{m_X}{E} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{3.41}{27} \right)^2} \approx 0.992
   \]

3. **Calculate \(\beta \gamma \)**:
   \[
   \beta \gamma \approx 7.915 \times 0.992 \approx 7.85
   \]

4. **Calculate the mean decay length (\(L_{\text{mean}}\))**:
   \[
   L_{\text{mean}} = \beta \gamma c \tau_0 = 7.85 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 1.88 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (\text{1.88 micrometers})
   \]

5. **Determine the required resolution (\(\delta\))** to observe at least 30% of the decays:
   \[
   \exp\left(-\frac{\delta}{L_{\text{mean}}}\right) = 0.3 \implies \delta = -L_{\text{mean}} \ln(0.3) \approx 1.88 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \times 1.203 \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (\text{2.27 micrometers})
   \]

Thus, the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is \boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Alternatively, given that with 30% probability, whether that corresponds to the minimum decay length, or that producing 30% decay in the path. But perhaps the particle goes a distance L, so the cumulative probability of decaying up to L is 30%, so the detector resolution should be capable of resolving to that L.

The target L is such that P(decay < L) = 0.3, find L. Solving 1 - exp(-L/(gamma v tau0)) = 0.3 implies L = -gamma v tau0 ln(0.7). So, replacement needed.

Here, natural logarithm of 0.7 is approximately -0.3567, hence L ≈ gamma v tau0 * 0.3567. Therefore, plug in numbers.

Breaking points:

First compute gamma: 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me compute that precisely:

gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9155. So, γ≈7.9155.

Then, beta from γ: beta = sqrt(1 - (m_x^2 / E^2)) where E is energy. But given that E is the total energy (which is γ m). But However, the velocity can be found as (pc^2)/E, where p is the particle's momentum. Since E² = (pc)^2 c² + (m c²)^2 => (pc)² = (E² - m² c^4)/c². Therefore, pc = sqrt(E² - m²) in units where c=1.

Wait, perhaps we need to calculate beta as sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2):

In Natural units (where c=1), beta = p / E where p is sqrt(E² - m²), thus beta = sqrt(1 - m² / E²). For us, m_X = 3.41 GeV, E =27 GeV. So:

beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41 / 27)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.01594) = sqrt(0.98406) ≈ 0.992. So, beta ≈ 0.992. So velocity is 0.992c, therefore.

Thus, beta γ ≈ 7.9155 * 0.992 ≈ 7.85. But actually, combining m and E. Alternatively, consider exact calculation of beta gamma.

Another approach: beta gamma is proportional to momentum/m. Since gamma beta = E beta / (m c^2) if we're using E total energy. Wait, let's compute βγ, which can sometimes be expressed via momentum. For a particle, the momentum p is γ β m. So βγ = p/m. The energy E is γ m. Thus p = sqrt(E² - m²). So βγ = sqrt(E² - m²)/m = sqrt( (27^2 - 3.41^2) )/3.41. Let's compute that:

27^2 = 729, 3.41 squared = approximately 11.6281. Then,

sqrt(729 - 11.6281) = sqrt(717.3719) ≈ 26.783 GeV. Thus βγ ≈ 26.783 / 3.41 ≈7.85 in line with previous estimate. So, yes.

Therefore, beta gamma is approximately 7.85. However, the gamma itself was approximately 7.9155, which isn't critical unless needed with precision.

Given that Gamma (as standard notation) is 7.9155, so L is Gamma * beta * c * tau0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Tau0 in proper frame is 8e-16 seconds.

Then, first compute Gamma * beta: 7.9155 * 0.992≈7.85( as before)

But since Lorentz factor Gamma is γ=7.9155, and β=0.992, combination gives Gamma*beta =7.9155*0.992≈7.85.

Given c=3e8 m/s.

So, then L is Gamma*beta*c*tau0*0.3567 (because -ln(0.7)≈0.3567).

Wait: L= Gamma beta c tau0 * (-ln(1 -0.3))= (beta gamma c) tau0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Given that and values:

beta gamma≈7.85, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 seconds. So:

compute (7.85)*(3e8 m/s)*(8e-16 s)*0.3567.

Wait let's compute step-by-step.

First, beta gamma * c: 7.85 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.355e9 m/s.

Wait: Wait beta gamma is ((beta gamma)=7.85), but beta gamma multiplied by c gives (beta gamma c) is then 7.85 *3e8 m/s.

But actually, the relation:

In natural units c=1, but here in SI:

L = (beta gamma c) tau0 (exponent factor -ln(1-0.3))

But if we keep beta gamma as Gamma times beta, since it's calculated correctly. Exact formula:

L = beta gamma * c * tau0 * (-ln(0.7))

So, calculating beta gamma since beta gamma=7.85 as above.

Yes.

Hence:

7.85 * c * tau0 * (-ln(0.7)).

Compute step-by-step. Let's multiply numbers:

First, take L = 7.85 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s * (-ln(0.7)).

First, 7.85*3e8=2.355e9

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.355e9 *8e-16 =1.884e-6

Multiply by -ln(0.7) ~0.3567: 1.884e-6 *0.3567 ≈6.7216e-7 m, that's meters.

So, 6.7216e-7 meters ≈ 672.16e-9 m ≈672 nanometers.

But a partile physics experiment wouldn't really use nm. If correctly, perhaps converting this into centimeters:

Since 1 m =100 cm, so 6.7216e-7 m =6.7216e-5 cm =0.000067216 cm=approximately6.7216e-5 cm.

But 1 micrometer (micron)=1e-6 meters. So the result in micrometers is 0.6721 micrometers ~0.67 microns. However, how reasonable is this?

Given time scale of 8e-16 seconds and gamma ~8, with velocity near 3e8 m/s *0.992. Decay time tau= gamma tau0≈7.9e-15 seconds. So distance traveled during this time is beta c gamma tau0=0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s≈2.38e-8 meters. Wait, but we ended up earlier with 670 nm which is bigger. So perhaps mistake.

Wait. Please make clarifications.

Wait, in order to have detected decays, the position where the decay occurs needs to be discernible.

If decaying particles are produced in trackers, then live for certain time and decay into other charged particles. The length between production and decay, called decay length, must be distinguishable from zero (the production point). Hence, the precision of the detector. If the decay occurs within the resolution, you can't distinguish the decay products as displaced from the production point, so you wouldn't see the decay. Hence, to observe 30% of decays, the uncertainty/resolution must be less than that distance which 30% of the decay lengths exceed. Wait, need clarify: to observe 30% of the decays, beyond a threshold Lmin, the probability someone can observe is when decay occurs at a distance L > Lres (resolution), you can detect. So maybe variance-> something else here.

Alternatively, total cross-section and so on. Or:

Assuming any decay is visible if occurs at a distance L larger than the resolution delta. So, the probability to decay with L^>delta is exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau0)). Wait, not quite. The decay probability distribution is P(L) dL = (1/(beta gamma c tau0)) exp( -L / (beta gamma c tau0) ) dL. Hence, integrated probability from L=delta to infinity is exp( -delta / (beta gamma c tau0) ). To observe at least 30%, need this exponentialsult must be at least 0.3. Thus,

exp( -delta / ( )) =0.3,

which gives delta / (beta gamma c tau0) = -ln(0.3)=1.20397

Hence,

delta= beta gamma c tau0 *1.20397≈( computed βγ c tau0) *1.20397

But let me comprehend, "to observe at least 30% of the decays," the wording is ambiguous.

Either:

Probability to decay beyond the resolution distance, and hence the track is long enough to detect, which is 30%; so the probability of longer track than delta equals 30%, meaning delta is such that exp( - delta / <L> )=0.3. Thus delta= - <L> ln( 0.3 )= tau mean path *1.2= larger delta.

Alternatively, observation of 30% decay could be understood as 30% of the particles decaying in a way that the decay is distinguishable. If the detector has resolution delta, then decay lengths above delta can be detected, and below cannot.

But perhaps the correct understanding is，Suppose that the detector can only detect decay vertices if the decay occurs at a distance greater than delta from the production point. Then the fraction detected is exp(-delta/(beta gamma c tau0)). But to "observe at least 30% of the decays", this would require exp(-delta/(...)) <= 0.7 ? Wait no:Total decays should be adjusted. Wait, no.

Actually expect:

Number of decays detected is proportional to the number of decay vertices with displacement >delta. But initially, the number of decays depends on survival probability. Wait, this is confusing standard proportions.

The Particle Physics book formulae:

The number of decays N observed with displaced vertices greater than delta is N =N_0 *exp( - delta/(gamma beta c tau0) )

But this seems incorrect. Actually, no. Let's reevaluate.

Lifetime distribution:

The probability that the particle decays at length L is dP/dL = (1/(gamma beta c tau0)) exp(-L/(gamma beta c tau0))

Thus, the probability that decay occurs at L>delta is the integral from L= delta to infinity: = exp( - delta/(gamma beta c tau0))

Hence, this is the probability of a decay occurring at distance L>delta. So, if we have a detector with resolution delta, events with L>delta can be observed as displaced vertices. Then the problem states that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays, so:

exp(-delta / (gamma beta c tau0)) >=0.3

Because the observed fraction is the longer decay paths. Hence:

for which solving for delta:

delta <= gamma beta c tau0 (- ln0.3) /1≈gamma beta c tau0 *1.20397...

But the phrasing in the problem is "observe at least 30% of the decays". So if the resonance can only detect decays with L>delta, the fraction observed is F= exp(-delta/(gamma beta c tau0)) So F=remaining fraction: Want F≈0.3. So in order to have at least 30% detected, delta needs to be such that:

delta<= gamma beta c tau0 * (-ln(F))=gamma beta c tau0 * (- ln(0.3))≈gamma beta c tau0 *1.20397

This would give the maximum delta (resolution) (assuming resolutions lower than delta >>lower delta?)

Wait, the maximum delta since when delta is smaller, more small decay lengths are detected. Ah, inversely. If a detector's position resolution is delta, decay vertices closer than delta would not be resolved but perhaps seen as merged with the primary vertex. Hence, particles decaying within delta of the primary vertex would go undetected. Thus, detected fraction is:

1 - integral from L=0 to delta of dP/dL dL = exp(-delta/(gamma beta c tau0)).

Therefore, the detected fraction is N/N0=exp(-delta / (gamma beta c tau0)). To have N/N0 >=0.3, therefore:

exp(-delta / (gamma beta c tau0)) >=0.3 ---> so delta <= gamma beta c tau0*(- ln0.3) ... which is delta <= gamma beta c tau0 *1.20397. 

Hence, the required resolution delta is less than or equal to gamma beta c tau0 *1.20397. So the MINUMUM resolution necessary (best possible resolution) would correspond to delta = gamma beta c tau0*1.20397. The resolution is the smallest delta which allows 30% to be observed, but problem says "minimum resolution" needed to observe at at least 30%. Hmmm.

Wait, But in reality, if resolution is worse (bigger delta), this effective fine delta means you can't see vertices closer than delta. So okay, resolvingPower is inversely related. So the minimal resolution required is actually this threshold.

Wait Forgotten for a moment. Let me think in clearer terms. Let's pretend Delta is the resolution of the detector. If Delta is quite big (like 1 meter), then only particles that decay after traveling a meter would be observed as decays. If Delta is very small (smaller than an average decay length), then most decays would be observed.

But in inverse: the detector's resolution affecting its ability to distinguish decay vertices.

Therefore, decay length L. If the particle decays very close to the production point (at delta << L), then the decay can't be resolved and is not observed. Therefore, the number of resolvable decays would be those that decay beyond L=Delta.

The number of such decays is N =N_0 * exp( -Delta/( | 

But from differential decay probability:

dN/dL = N_0/(L_mean) exp(-L/L_mean}

Where L_mean= gamma beta c tau0

Then, the number decays beyond Delta is Int_{L=Delta}^\infty dN/dL dL = N_0 *exp(-Delta/L_mean)

So yes, the detected fraction is exp(-Delta / L_mean). To have at least 30% (N/N0 >=0.3), we need:

exp(-Delta/L_mean)>=0.3 --> -Delta/L_mean >= ln(0.3) -->Delta <= - L_mean ln(0.3)≈L_mean *1.20397

Therefore, Delta <= L_mean *1.20397. Hence, about 1.2 times the mean decay length. But where L_mean=gamma beta c tau0≈7.85 *3e8m/s *8e-16s

Compute L_mean:

gamma beta=7.85

c=3e8 m/s

tau0=8e-16 s

L_mean=7.85 *3e8 *8e-16≈7.85*24e-8=approx 189e-8 m=1.89e-6 meters=1.89 micrometers.

Therefore，was earlier computation.

Thus, resolution length needed for critical value is:

Delta_max=1.20397*1.89e-6 m≈2.275e-6 m≈2.275 micrometers.

Therefore, L_mean≈1.89e-6 m and Delta between this required exceeds L avg explanation:

wait, perhaps I messed mean (L_mean) is average decay path. Meaning that individual decay happen on average around μ=1.89e-6 m, 1.89 micrometers.

But a detector must resolve at least: ... Remember, the critical Delta that permits us to see just 30% of the decays. Therefore the required resolution would be to set Delta approx≈2.28 micrometers (for little over two microns). Wait, wait but calculation says to have Delta= 1.20*L_mean (approx).

Alternate approach:

Given l_mean=gamma * beta *c*tau0= (8e-16 s) * (0.992c) c= speed of light.

Wait gamma= E/m ≈27/3.41=7.915.

Beta= sqrt(1−m²/E²)=sqrt(1−(3.41/27)^2)≈sqrt(1−(0.1263)^2)= approx 0.992.

Therefore, l_mean= beta * gamma * c * tau0≈7.915 *0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

→Calculate this:

betaγ=approx 7.85, as before. So,

7.85 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.355e9 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s:

2.355e9 *8e-16≈1.884e-6 meters ≈1.884 micrometers.

Thus, mean decay length is ~1.88 micrometers. To find the resolution to detect >=30%, we need:

exp(-Delta/l_mean)=0.3

Thus,

Delta= -l_mean * ln(0.3)=1.88μm *1.203.≈2.265 micrometers, or ~2.27 microns.

So, needed resolution is approximately 2.27 micrometers（2.27 microns.

Considering that experimentally, this is plausible scale for a bubble chamber's resolution?

But wait, in bubble chambers, resolution can be limited by bubble size. As per knowledge, the resolution may vary, but typically on the order of 50-100 microns may be reported. Not sure, but if so the here ~2-3 microns may be beyond available resolution. But of course this depends on the conditions. Possibly, signifies original question wants calculation（rather than experiment check).

Alternatively, the problem says: speciically, what minimum resolution is required (i.e., maximum delta) to "observe 30%". Right, but if we must observe at least 30%, so...

The probability of a decay happening beyond a certain distanceDelta is p= exp(−Delta / L_mean). For p>=0.3, implying exp(−Delta / L_mean) >=0.3.

Thus, log(p)>=log(0.3)

mult both sides by -1. Inequality flips:

(Delta/L_mean) <= -log(0.3) => Delta <= L_mean*(-log(0.3))=approx 1.203* L_mean=1.203*1.88mu=2.26 mu.

Thus, the maximum allowable Delta is ~2.26micrometers, to that ensure that N_obs=0.3. So I need to invert:

If the delta is 2.26 microns, then fluctuation allows some decays below this to be detected? Alternatively, it's more a probabilistic approach. OK, regardless, question is.

So per logic, structured as:

- Correctly compute gamma=E/m=27 GeV /3.41  GeV ≈7.915.

- β= sqrt(1-(m/E)^2) ≈0.992.

- verified βγ≈7.85.

- Calculated c*τ0*βγ= decay length mean ≈1.88e-6m=1.88 mi microns.

- For 30% observation, resolution required is delta=-L_mean * ln(0.3)≈1.88*1.203≈~2.26 microns.

But in proper units expressed.

Now converting to feasibility。For more precise answer.

Calculations a bit more accurately:

Gamma=27 /3.41= it’s 27÷3.41.

Let me compute Gamma per exact calculation：

3.41 *7=23.  first.

So，7*3.41=23.87.

Wrong, 3.41*7=23.87.

But 27 /3.41 is bigger: 27 -23.87=3.13 remaining.

Therefore, approx 7 +3.13/(3.41) =7. +0.917≈7.917.

Thus, gamma≈7.917.

Betaγ now.

To compute beta precisely:

We need the velocity, beta = sqrt(1-(m_X/E)^2), with m_X=3.41 GeV and E=27 GeV.(assuming it's not in units where c=1).

Complications? MILDLY.

If units are relativistic (GeV energy, GeV/c² mass:

GIVEN total energy E=γ m c² →γ=E/(mc²). Wait in units where c=1, but when line in CERN LHC physics, E_rest= m: But here energy equais sumtotal. But simplifying: Assume units where c=1.

Mass is m_x=3.41 GeV/c²? If E is 27 GeV, then γ= E/(m_x c²) (m_xc² is rest energy). Suppose answer in GeV-based units. That would be gamma=E/(m_x). So expectedly=27 / 3.41= ~7.917.

Important aspect to take.

Beta calculation:

if E_tot = gamma m, as we have. Then：

gamma = 7.917 (approx)

Given that gamma=1/sqrt(1- beta^2), swapping for beta:

beta= sqrt( 1 - 1/gamma^2 )≈sqrt(1-1/(7.917^2))≈sqrt(1-0.016)≈sqrt(0.984)= approx 0.992.

Exhaustively:

gamma squared is (7.917)^2=62.678.

Thus,

1/gamma²≈0.01594.

Then,

1-1/gamma²≈0.98406, sqrt is approx 0.992.

Thus, beta indeed≈0.992.

Then beta gamma≈7.917×0.992≈7.853.

Calculation:

7.917 ×0.992= 7.917*(1-0.008)=7.917 -7.917*0.008.

7.917* 0.008=0.063336.

Therefore，7.917 -0.0633≈7.853≈7.85.

Thus BETA gamma≈7.85.

Thus, now proceed with seconds and meters。

First tau0=8e-16 s.

The mean decay length: gamma beta c tau0= βγ c τ0.

βgamma ~7.85, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

Thus, L_mean=7.85*3e8*8e-16= let's calculate：

7.85*3 *8 =188.4, times e8*e-16=e-8.

Thus， L=188.4e-8 meters =1.884e-6 meters=1.884 micrometers.

TauNext, for a observation of at least 30% of decay: probability P= exp(-delta/L_mean)=1-0.3=0.7? No.

Wait in currenttimes, if you want to detect at least 30% of the decays (fraction detectExtra).
Actually much back and forth here: bridge closing.

As derived, the number of detected decays is the integral over all decay lengths where L>delta, leading to propability=exp(-delta/L_mean). To have at least 30% detection efficient:

exp(-delta/L_mean) >=0.3 ---> this requires delta <= L_mean*(-ln 0.3)=1.203* L_mean。

Thus, delta_max=1.203*1.884= 2.267 micrometers.

That would be approximately 2.27 micrometers. Hence, the minimum resolution (maximum allowed delta) would need to maior reside a value not exceeding approximately 2.27 micrometers.

But the problem specifies "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays". In terms of trajectory measurement: want measurable decay vertices constituting 30% original aperture, hence requires identifying at least a displacement of 2.27 micron. So the Resolution needs to be better (smallet delta) to detect most of this.

But wait precise phrasing now: possibly we need a the detector resolution, delta, must be at least good enough (i.e. as small as ) equaled to the displacement corresponding to deci being with 30% chance. But previous counter Extract Here: N factors.

Alternatively.perhaps Number:

Wait another misunderstanding could occur, assumption is backward：

Suppose 30% of the decayed particles are observable. If your detector is too粗， or clumpy (resolution:

 bad resolution can't resolve decay lengths shorter than d_r。Then, the observable fraction would be exp(-d_r /L_mean).To have observable fraction >=30%, requires exp(-d_r/L _mean) >=0.3 ⟹d_r<= -ln(0.3)L_mean。

Thus resolving power think lower SD-> poznan.better resolution.

Thus ambiguity between resolution and required耜;& similarly.

Translate the concluding: know that the requirement is delta<=2.27 micrometersto enable at least 30% of the decays observable.

QED: but no more.

So 2.27 micro  meter closure.

Convenient conversion: 1 micro=1e-6 meters. So answering expressed in meters, millimeter, etc., recomend micrometers.

Compute delta/L_mean= 1.20（Rigorous：ln(0.7)=?

Wait wait. The P(decaying at distance > delta)=exp(-delta/L_mean). (yes.)

In Order to Observe at least 30% , desire exp(-delta/L_mean)=0.3. Ah! Precisely:

No, wait. If setting P(>=delta)=0.3，then exp(-delta/L_mean)=0.3. hence delta= - L_mean ln 0.3。But earlier had calculated delta=gamma*beta*c*tau0*(-ln 0.3).

No problem.
Hence, correction steps afforded: in case original discovery needs to be made by the user.

But on cross-check  references.

Therefore through all.

Proper Answer formatting:

 step-by-step calculation:

1. Calculate Lorentz factor γ= E/m =27 GeV /3.41 GeV ≈7.915.

2. Calculate velocity factor β= sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2)=sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2)≈0.992.

3. Compute βγ=7.915*0.992≈7.85.

4. Calculate mean decay length L_mean= βγcτ0= 7.85*3e8 m/s *8e-16 s= approximately 1.88 micrometers.

5. Require that the probability of decay verton from at least delta is30%, which equates to:

N/N0= exp(-delta/L_mean)=0.3 --> delta ≈-L_mean*ln(0.7).

Accuraciak.y when solving for delta:

exp(-delta/L_mean)=0.3.

Log both sithons:

 -delta/L_mean=ln(0.3).

delta= -L_mean*link 0.3。

Natural log of0.3 is approx-1.20397, thus delta= 1.203*laepids=1.88 m againm*1.203=2.265 micrometers.

Concelate as âpi approximately 2.27 micrometers= 2.27×10^-6 meters=2270 nanometers.

Expressed as 2.27μm.

Formulate Answerfieldboxed.

Thus the answer is ~ 2.27 micrometer. Expressed as \boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6}\text{ m}}.

Or with 2 significant figures as initial given data: central lifetime tautom=8e-16 s (1 sig fig as it's '8×10^{-16} s?), but applicable, approx total mass and energy variance.[However, tau0 is given as 8x10^- 16 starting <- in scenario likely required using 2 significant Mon et al perhaps]。

Thanksgiving.

Further checking I h(think):

In particle physics questions, distances often expressed in cm (if not kV units). Assuming si units perhaps, but a minority.

Fold 2.27 x 10^{-6 } m is 2.27 micrometers. Which in centimetres is 2.27e-4 cm. To this is 0.000227 cm.

Alternatively u might write 227 micrometers onto it occasionally $e-6$/ meters.

But the correct the answer is uncertain.

Forging conclusion, per the calculations delta≈2.27 microns (2.27e-6 meters).

Therefore, formatting term key answer as boxed  2.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m} }

**Final Answer**
The minimum resolution needed is \boxed{2.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}}.
