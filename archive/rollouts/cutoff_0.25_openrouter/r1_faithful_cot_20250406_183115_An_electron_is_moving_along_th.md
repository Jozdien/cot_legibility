# Original Question

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.

The energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.

What is the angle between the directions of the photons?

The problem involves an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons with equal energies. The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has a Lorentz factor of 2. The directions of the photons are measured to be upper-right and lower-right. We need to determine the angle between the photons.

1. **Energy and Momentum Calculation:**
   - The energy of the electron is \( E_e = 4m_e c^2 \) and its momentum is \( p_e = \sqrt{15} m_e c \).
   - The energy of the positron is \( E_p = 2m_e c^2 \) and its momentum is \( p_p = \sqrt{3} m_e c \).
   - Total initial energy is \( E_{\text{total}} = 6m_e c^2 \).
   - Total initial momentum is \( p_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{15} m_e c - \sqrt{3} m_e c \).

2. **Photon Energies and Momenta:**
   - Each photon has energy \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3m_e c^2 \), hence momentum \( p_{\text{photon}} = 3m_e c \).

3. **Momentum Conservation:**
   - The x-components of the photons' momenta must sum to the initial momentum.
   - Each photon's momentum in the x-direction is \( 3m_e c \cos\theta \).
   - Conservation of momentum gives \( 2 \times 3m_e c \cos\theta = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c \).

4. **Solving for the Angle:**
   - Solving for \(\cos\theta\):
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
     \]
   - Calculating \(\theta\) using the arccosine function gives \(\theta \approx 69^\circ\).
   - The angle between the two photons is \(2\theta \approx 138^\circ\).

Thus, the angle between the directions of the photons is \(\boxed{138^\circ}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so there's this problem about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. Both particles are moving along the horizontal axis, the electron from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After the collision, they produce two photons with equal energies, one moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons' directions. Hmmm, let's think about this step by step.

Alright, first things first, Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor γ is given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right? So for the electron, γ is 4, and for the positron, it's 2. Since we are dealing with a collision and annihilation, conservation laws must apply here—both energy and momentum. Since photons are massless, their energies are related to their momentum by E = pc, where p is the magnitude of the momentum vector.

But the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So their momenta must have the same magnitude as well. However, their directions are different: one is upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is about the angle between these two directions.

Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, they have both x and y components of momentum. But because the total momentum before collision was purely along the x-axis (since both the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis), the total momentum after the collision must also be along the x-axis. That means the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Since the two photons have the same energy (and thus same magnitude of momentum), their y-components must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So one is going upwards, the other downwards, but symmetrically.

Wait, the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right, so their y-components are opposite, but they both have x-components in the positive direction, since right is positive. So after collision, the two photons are moving to the right but at some angles above and below the horizontal axis. Therefore, their angles with respect to the x-axis must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So if one is at angle θ above the x-axis, the other is at θ below. Then, the angle between them would be 2θ. So the problem reduces to finding θ, then doubling it.

But how do we find θ? Well, using conservation of energy and momentum.

First, let's compute the energies and momenta of the electron and positron before the collision.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γmc². The momentum is p = γmv. Let me recall the relation between γ and velocity. Since γ = 4 for the electron, we can write velocity v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c. Similarly for the positron with γ = 2, its velocity v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)c.

But perhaps I don't need the velocities right away. Let's first compute the energies and momenta.

For the electron (particle 1):
E1 = γ_e * m_e c² = 4 * m_e c²
Momentum p1 = γ_e m_e v_e. Let's compute p1. Wait, from γ = 4, so v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c. Then p1 = γ_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4)c = m_e c sqrt(15). But actually, a faster way to compute momentum for relativistic particles is p = γ m v, but another relation is p = E v / c². Let me check that.

Yes, p = γ m v = γ m c β (where β = v/c) and E = γ m c², so p = (E / c²) * β c = E β / c. So maybe p = E β / c. So for the electron:

E1 = 4 m_e c²

β1 = v_e / c = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682

So p1 = (4 m_e c²) * (sqrt(15)/4) / c = m_e c sqrt(15)/1 ≈ 3.872 m_e c.

But check that. Wait, if γ = 4, then p = γ m v = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4)c = m_e c sqrt(15). That's 3.872 m_e c. Sounds right.

Similarly for the positron (particle 2):

γ = 2, so E2 = 2 m_e c²

v_p is (sqrt(3)/2)c. Then p2 = 2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2)c = m_e c sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732 m_e c.

But wait, a positron has the same mass as an electron, so m_e is the same. However, since the positron is moving from the right, its momentum is in the opposite direction. So p2 would be negative if we take the electron's direction (left to right) as positive. Wait, the electron is moving from left to right, positron from right to left. If we take the electron's direction as positive x-axis, then positron's velocity is in the negative x direction, hence momentum is negative.

Wait, maybe we need to clarify the coordinate system. Let's assume that the electron is moving along the positive x-axis (from left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-axis (from right to left). Therefore, their momenta are in opposite directions.

Therefore, total initial momentum is p1 (positive) plus p2 (negative). So total p_initial = p1 - p2. Since p1 = γ_e m_e v_e = sqrt(15) m_e c ≈ 3.872 m_e c, and p2 = γ_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2)c = sqrt(3) m_e c ≈ 1.732 m_e c.

But the positron's velocity is in the negative x-direction, so its momentum is - p2 = - sqrt(3) m_e c. Therefore, total initial momentum is p1 + (-p2_initial) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c. Wait, no, no, if the positron is moving from the right, its velocity is negative, so the momentum is negative. So the initial momentum would be p1 - p2, with p1 and p2 magnitudes. Wait, but actually, when being precise: p_initial_total = p_e (electron's momentum) + p_p (positron's momentum) = (γ_e m_e v_e) * î + (γ_p m_e v_p) * (-î). So yes, p_initial_total = (γ_e v_e - γ_p v_p) m_e î / c? Wait, not sure.

Wait, maybe better to do with variables properly. Let's let the electron be moving in the +x direction with speed u, so its momentum is p_e = γ_e m_e u. The positron is moving in the -x direction with speed v, so its momentum is p_p = γ_p m_e (-v). So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = γ_e m_e u - γ_p m_e v. Then in terms of c, perhaps better to use β factors. So u = β_e c, v = β_p c. So total momentum is γ_e m_e β_e c - γ_p m_e β_p c. Then factoring, p_initial = (γ_e β_e - γ_p β_p) m_e c. So total initial momentum.

Similarly, total energy is E_initial = γ_e m_e c² + γ_p m_e c².

So in numbers:

For electron, γ_e = 4. Then β_e = sqrt(1 - 1/γ_e²) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

For positron, γ_p = 2. β_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Then p_initial = (4 * (sqrt(15)/4) - 2 * (sqrt(3)/2)) m_e c. Wait, that first term: γ_e β_e = 4 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15). Second term: γ_p β_p = 2 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3). So p_initial = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c ≈ (3.872 - 1.732) m_e c ≈ 2.14 m_e c.

Total initial energy E_initial = (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

After collision, two photons with equal energy. Let’s call each photon's energy E_photon. Since they have equal energy, E_photon = E_total / 2 = 3 m_e c².

But wait, each photon must have energy E_photon1 and E_photon2. The problem states they have the same energy, so E_photon1 = E_photon2 = 3 m_e c².

Each photon's momentum is p_photon = E_photon / c, so |p_photon| = 3 m_e c.

But momentum must be conserved as a vector. So the vector sum of the photons' momenta must equal the initial total momentum.

Let me denote the two photons as photon A and photon B. Photon A is moving at an angle θ above the x-axis, and photon B at an angle θ below the x-axis. So both are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Then, their y-components of momentum should cancel each other out. Since their energies are equal, their y-components are opposite. Therefore, the total y momentum cancels. Their x-components will add up.

Each photon's momentum x-component is p_photon * cosθ, and y-component is p_photon * sinθ and -p_photon * sinθ. Therefore, total momentum after collision is 2 * p_photon * cosθ in the x-direction, and 0 in the y-direction.

Therefore, conservation of momentum in x-direction:

p_initial_total = 2 p_photon cosθ.

But p_initial_total from earlier is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c ≈ 2.14 m_e c.

We know p_photon is E_photon / c = 3 m_e c² / c = 3 m_e c. Therefore,

2 * 3 m_e c * cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.

We can divide both sides by m_e c:

2 * 3 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

=> 6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

So cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6

Let me compute that:

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.14

Then divide by 6: 2.14 / 6 ≈ 0.357

Therefore, cosθ ≈ 0.357, which would correspond to θ ≈ arccos(0.357) ≈ 69 degrees. Then angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees. But that seems like a lot. Let me check if this calculation is correct.

Wait, 3.872 might want to carry more precise numbers.

Wait sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872983346, and sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732050808.

Thus sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872983346 - 1.732050808 ≈ 2.140932538. Then divided by 6: 2.140932538 / 6 ≈ 0.35682209. Then arccos(0.3568) is roughly? So cosθ ≈ 0.3568. Let me check:

cos(60°) = 0.5, cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584. Wait that's very close. Because 69 degrees: cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584, which is very close to 0.3568. So about 69 degrees. So the angle between the two photons would be roughly 138 degrees. But the question is "what is the angle between the directions of the photons?" Since one is θ above and the other θ below, the angle between them is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees. Hmm, but since we need an exact answer, we need to compute this symbolically.

Alternatively, maybe we can find an exact expression. Let's try.

We have cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6

But (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 can be written as sqrt(3)/6 (sqrt(5) - 1), since sqrt(15) = sqrt(3*5) = sqrt(3) sqrt(5). So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)(sqrt(5) - 1).

Thus, cosθ = sqrt(3)(sqrt(5) - 1)/6.

Alternatively, sqrt(3)/6 is (1/2) / sqrt(3), hmm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's some trigonometric identity here.

Alternatively, square both sides:

cos²θ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))² / 36

Calculates numerator:

(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))² = 15 + 3 - 2 sqrt(45) = 18 - 6 sqrt(5)

Therefore cos²θ = (18 - 6 sqrt(5))/36 = (3 - sqrt(5))/6 ≈ (3 - 2.236)/6 ≈ 0.764/6≈0.1273, so cos²θ≈0.1273, cosθ≈0.357,

Wait but wait that can’t be, earlier computation matched cosθ≈0.357 (cos69°≈0.356), but then cos squared is about 0.127, which gives θ≈69°, since cos(theta)=sqrt(0.127)? Wait, no, wait sorry, cos squared theta would be (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))² /36 ≈ (2.14)² / 36 ≈ 4.58 / 36 ≈ 0.127.

Wait, yes, cos²θ = 0.127, so cosθ = sqrt(0.127)≈ 0.356. So θ≈69°, as before. Then angle between them is 2θ≈138°, which is approximately 138 degrees.

But let's see, the question may require an exact answer in terms of inverse cosine or expressed in terms of radicals.

Alternatively, maybe there is a clever way to compute angle theta using some geometrical consideration. Wait, but given that the energy and momentum have to be conserved, and that leads to a specific angle.

Alternatively, verifying if result is 180 degrees. Unlikely, since photons are moving to the right. So angle between them can't be 180°, which would mean going in opposite directions. They are symmetric with respect to x-axis, moving to the right, so angle is 2 theta.

But maybe possible to make the exact calculation.

Alternatively, let's check this again:

When particles annihilate, they must conserve both energy and momentum. Let's verify if these numbers check out.

Total initial energy: 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² =6 m_e c².

So each photon must have energy 3 m_e c².

Total initial momentum: p_initial = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c ≈ (3.872 - 1.732) m_e c ≈ 2.14 m_e c.

Each photon has momentum 3 m_e c (since E_photon = 3 m_e c², and p_photon = E_photon /c =3 m_e c).

Total p_final in x-direction: 2 * 3 m_e c * cosθ, which is equal to p_initial; so cosθ = p_initial / (6 m_e c)

Which is cosθ≈(2.14)/(6)≈0.357, as before. So angle theta≈69°, angle between them 138°.

But the problem is may want the answer in exact terms.

Wait, we can compute cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6.

Find exact value. So compute:

sqrt(15) = sqrt(5*3), sqrt(3). Maybe relates to regular angles?

Another thought: Since photons are produced, and the total energy and momentum is set, this problem likely results in specific angle. Hmmm. Alternatively, special angle?

Alternatively, compute the angle theta such that cos(theta)=( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )/6 ≈ (3.872 -1.732)/6=2.14/6≈0.357.

If we compute 2θ, which is angle between photons, perhaps relates to inverse cosine, but perhaps it's 120 degrees. Alternatively, let me check whether arccos( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/4 )? Maybe recognizing some relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps we can accept that the answer is 2θ ≈ 138°, which is 2 times arccos( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 ). But unless there's a trigonometric identity, which may or may not exist, but most likely in competition problems like this, angle is a nice number, but here it's around 138°, which is simply twice about 69°, perhaps we need an exact answer in radians or in degrees, but likely in degrees. Alternatively, maybe via cos(2θ). Let me see.

Wait, perhaps compute the angle between the two photons. If each is at θ above and below, the angle between them is 2θ. So if cosθ = x, then angle between is 2θ, which is 2 arccos x.

But since x is (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6, we just compute 2θ as 2 * arccos( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 ). That's as exact as we can get. However, to provide a numerical answer, perhaps approximate degrees.

But the problem asks for the angle in a box, so probably either exact or approximate. Given that the initial data is given with integers (Lorentz factors 4 and 2), maybe the answer is a whole number, perhaps 120°?

Wait, let's verify the calculation. Let me try again step by step.

Given:

--Electron: γ =4, so energy =4 * m_e c², momentum is p_e = sqrt(γ² -1) m_e c= sqrt(16-1) m_e c = sqrt(15) m_e c.

Wait, another relation: For a relativistic particle, p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ). So yes, p_e = sqrt( (4 m_e c^2/c)^2 - (m_e c)^2 ) = sqrt(16 m_e² c² - m_e² c² ) = sqrt(15) m_e c.

Similarly, positron: γ=2, so E=2 m_e c², p_p = sqrt(4 -1) m_e c = sqrt(3) m_e c.

But positron is moving in opposite direction, so its momentum is - sqrt(3) m_e c.

Thus total initial momentum is sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Energy is conserved as total 6 m_e c², so each photon has energy 3 m_e c², so each photon has p=3 m_e c.

Total momentum after: since symmetrically emitted, their momenta are p1 = 3 m_e c (cosθ, sinθ), p2=3 m_e c (cosθ, -sinθ). Total x-component: 6 m_e c cosθ, y-component is zero.

Therefore, equate to the initial momentum:

6 m_e c cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Cancel m_e c,

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

Then theta = arccos( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6 )

So same as before.

Aha. Maybe instead of approximating, someone would perhaps look at this expression and see if it can be written as 75 degrees? wait:

Check 75 degrees. Cos(75°)= cos(45+30)=cos45 cos30 - sin45 sin30 = (√2/2)(√3/2) - (√2/2)(1/2) = √6/4 - √2/4 = (√6 -√2)/4 ≈ (2.449 -1.414)/0.25≈1.035/4≈0.2588, which is higher than what we have (which was ≈0.357 another idea?

Wait, 60 degrees. If I compute cos(60°)= 0.5.

Approximately, (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6≈2.140932538/6 ≈0.3568. This is closer to cos69°=0.3584. So 69°, doubles as 138°, approximate answer, So approx 138°, but exact answer is 2arccos[(sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6].

But is there a way to write that angle exactly?

Wait, perhaps a trigonometric identity, but I can't see it immediately.

Alternatively, let's compute the exact value:

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6

Let me square both sides:

cos²θ = (15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(15*3))/36 = (18 -2*sqrt(45))/36=(18 -6*sqrt(5))/36=(3 -sqrt(5))/6.

So cos²θ=(3 -sqrt(5))/6 ≈(3-2.2361)/6≈(0.7639)/6≈0.1273, which translates to θ≈69°, as before.

But perhaps recognize that (3 - sqrt(5))/6 can also written as (sqrt(5)-1)/ some expression? Maybe not.

Alternatively:

3 - sqrt(5). But unless this is a specific angle known. Hmmm. 3-sqrt(5)= approximate 3-2.236≈0.764.

Alternatively, it's equivalent to something like 1 - 2*sin^2(theta) maybe? Not obvious. So maybe it's best to say the answer is approximately 138°, but likely want the exact expression in terms of inverse cosine.

But how does the problem ask for the answer?

The original problem: "What is the angle between the directions of the photons?" So, I need to answer like: "The angle is arccos(....), which is approximately ... degrees." But since it's common to have exact answers in terms of standard angles, maybe 180° - 60°=120°, but why?

Alternatively, what if we think of a vector addition?

But the initial momentum (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))m_e c is approximately 2.14 m_e c,

which is the total momentum of two photons, each with 3m_e c.

Thus, the sum of the two photons' x-momentum is 6m_e c x cos(theta). So 2.14÷6≈0.356, which is cos(theta). Then there might be a more elegant way to see this. But I suspect given that sqrt(15) -sqrt(3) is about 2.14 and the rest, the exact angle in degrees is roughly the one we obtained.

Alternatively, let's see:

Is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6= sqrt(3)*(sqrt(5) -1)/(6).

hmmm. sqrt(3)/6(sqrt(5)-1)≈1.732/6(2.236-1)=1.732/6*(1.236)=≈1.732*0.206≈0.356, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe relate that to known angles.

Alternatively, computeθ in degrees algebraically.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe use Hyperphysics' formula for photon angles in annihilation.

But electron and positron annihilation typically when at rest result in two photons moving in opposite directions. But here, since the particles are moving, there is a non-zero momentum. So photons are moving forwards directions with some angles.

Alternatively, probably check with comoving frame. If they were moving with some velocity.

But now, given time constraints, since it's probably a numerical answer of about 138°, which radian measure butsince they didn't specify, let me check something.

Wait, maybe doing the exact calculation from my initial steps.

Wait:

Electron gamma=4

Energies: E_initial=4m c² +2m c²=6 m c²

Momentum: p_initial=sqrt(4² -1)m c - sqrt(2² -1)m c= sqrt(15) m c - sqrt(3) m c ≈ 3.872m c -1.732m c≈2.14m c

After annihilation: two photons, each with E=3 m c².

Thus each photon's momentum p_photon=E/c=3 m c

 total x momentum must be p_initial_photon_x=p1_x + p2_x=3m c cosθ +3m c cosθ=6m c cosθ

Set equal to initial momentum: 6m c cosθ= (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))m c

Cancel m c-> 6 cosθ= sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)

θ=acos( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 )

Thus angle between two photons is 2θ=2 arccos( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 )

I guess that's the exact answer, but we should compute it numerically. So let's compute:

angle in degrees:

theta=arccos( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 )

calculate with calculator:

Compute (sqrt(15) − sqrt(3)) divided by 6:

sqrt(15)=3.872983346; sqrt(3)=1.7320508075688772.

Difference: 3.872983346 − 1.7320508075688772≈2.1409325384311227

Divide by 6: ≈0.3568220897arccos(0.3568220897)

arccos(0.3568):

Degrees: θ≈69°, let me use calculator:

From calculator:

0.3568...

arccos inverse: in degrees, first think arccos(0.3568)

Cosine of 69°≈0.3584, linear approx near 69°:

Consider cos(θ)=0.3568, which is a bit less than cos69°=0.3584, so angle is ≈69.1°, as slightly more since cos decreases with angle.

Therefore, first compute delta: (0.3584 -0.3568)/(0.3584 - next)

Wait, the derivative of cos(theta) is -sin(theta). near x=69°, which is 1.204 radians.

Approximate how much angle increases to drop cosine from 0.3584 to 0.3568:

d(theta) = ( delta cos(theta) ) / (-sin(theta))

Let delta_cos = 0.3568 - 0.3584 = -0.0016

So d(theta)= (-0.0016)/(-sin(69°))

sin(69°)=0.9336, so d(theta)=0.0016/0.9336≈0.001714 radians ≈0.001714*(180/pi)≈0.098°. Therefore, theta≈69° + 0.098≈69.098°, about 69.1°. Therefore, 2 theta ≈138.2°, roughly 138 degrees.

Therefore, the angle between the two photons is approximately 138 degrees.

Thus, the answer is approximately 138°, which if we must round, the final answer is 138°. But in most linear systems, they'd tend to work with integers. Question is, is this approximate or meets some exact angle.

But Assuming the problem intends an exact value, but since these square roots aren’t aligning with any standard angles except I think approximations are called for. So the answer is approximately 138 degrees.

But checking another way:

Maximum angle between the two photons would be 180°, in which when they are arranged back-to-back. Here, they are opening angles upward and downward relative to the horizontal direction. Since both are moving to the right but symmetrically, the angle between them is more than 90°, right? If they were ejected at 45° up and down, the angle between them would be 90°. But here, if it's 69°, total angle around 138°, to the right direction.

Alternatively, maybe there’s an exact calculation method, but unless specific values are intended, I think answer is about 138 degrees.

Thus, box the approximate answer as\boxed{138^\circ}.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, given that Lorentz factors are 4 and 2, and given velocity of particles before collision. Another approach: Go to center-of-momentum frame where the total initial momentum is zero. Determine the direction of photons in that frame, which would typically (for annihilation at rest) be back-to-back. when transformed back to lab frame causes additive velocities. But steps:

But perhaps more complex. Let's try.

First, Calculate the velocity of the center-of-momentum (CM) frame.

In the lab frame, total energy E_lab = 6 m_e c², and total momentum p_lab= (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))m_e c.

The velocity of CM frame with respect to lab is v_CM such that v_CM = (c² p_lab)/(E_lab). Then,

v_CM = (c² * (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) m_e c ) / (6 m_e c² )

= ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) c / 6 ≈ (3.872 -1.732)/6 *c≈2.14 /6 *c≈0.357c. So gamma factor for CM frame is, γ_CM =1/ sqrt(1 - (0.357)^2)≈1/sqrt(1-0.1275)=1/sqrt(0.8725)≈1.07.

In CM frame, total momentum is zero. If the particles collide and annihilate, in CM frame, the photons must go in opposite directions (since in CM, if they annihilate at rest, the photons go in opposite directions to conserve momentum).

However, in this case, the collision is using moving particles. So in CM frame, the annihilation photons are back-to-back. But due to Doppler effect, when transformed back to lab frame, their directions change.

Hmm, but actually, perhaps even in CM frame, if particles have kinetic energy, how's the annihilation. Wait, when electron and positron annihilate, regardless of their motion, the photons must have directions opposite in CM frame.

But, the specifics must matter.

But let's see for a CM frame.

Assuming that in CM frame, the two particles (electron and positron) approach each other with equal speeds and opposite directions. But this is not the case here since one has gamma of 4, and another gamma of 2.

Therefore, maybe CM frame arguments become complicated. Let's proceed:

Alternatively, maybe considering that in CM frame, the velocity is v_CM=0.357c as we found.

In CM frame, the total energy is E_CM= sqrt(E_lab² - (p_lab c)^2 )= sqrt( (6 m_e c²)^2 - ( (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))m_e c *c )^2 ) let's compute.

E_CM = m_e c² sqrt( 36 - (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))² ) =

Compute inside sqrt (which we can):

36 - (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))² = 36 - (15 + 3 -2 sqrt(45))=36 - 18 +6 sqrt(5)=18 +6sqrt(5)=6(3 + sqrt(5))

So E_CM=m_e c² sqrt(6(3+sqrt(5)) )

But production of 2 photons requires their energies.

In CM frame, total energy is E_CM, and photons are emitted back-to-back with energies depending on the emission angles. But since they are moving in opposite directions, parameters are symmetric.

But after that, boost back to lab frame.

But considering that in Lab frame, photon directions are upper-right and lower-right. This requires interpreting the Doppler shift, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, since original calculation seems rigorous.

Thus, original calculation results in approximate 138 degrees. Therefore, boxed answer would be \boxed{138^\circ}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{138^\circ}

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so there's this problem about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. Both particles are moving along the horizontal axis, the electron from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After the collision, they produce two photons with equal energies, one moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons' directions. Hmmm, let's think about this step by step.

Alright, first things first, Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor γ is given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right? So for the electron, γ is 4, and for the positron, it's 2. Since we are dealing with a collision and annihilation, conservation laws must apply here—both energy and momentum. Since photons are massless, their energies are related to their momentum by E = pc, where p is the magnitude of the momentum vector.

But the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So their momenta must have the same magnitude as well. However, their directions are different: one is upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is about the angle between these two directions.

Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, they have both x and y components of momentum. But because the total momentum before collision was purely along the x-axis (since both the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis), the total momentum after the collision must also be along the x-axis. That means the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Since the two photons have the same energy (and thus same magnitude of momentum), their y-components must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So one is going upwards, the other downwards, but symmetrically.

Wait, the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right, so their y-components are opposite, but they both have x-components in the positive direction, since right is positive. So after collision, the two photons are moving to the right but at some angles above and below the horizontal axis. Therefore, their angles with respect to the x-axis must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So if one is at angle θ above the x-axis, the other is at θ below. Then, the angle between them would be 2θ. So the problem reduces to finding θ, then doubling it.

But how do we find θ? Well, using conservation of energy and momentum.

First, let's compute the energies and momenta of the electron and positron before the collision.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γmc². The momentum is p = γmv. Let me recall the relation between γ and velocity. Since γ = 4 for the electron, we can write velocity v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c. Similarly for the positron with γ = 2, its velocity v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)c.

But perhaps I don't need the velocities right away. Let's first compute the energies and momenta.

For the electron (particle 1):
E1 = γ_e * m_e c² = 4 * m_e c²
Momentum p1 = γ_e m_e v_e. Let's compute p1. Wait, from γ = 4, so v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c. Then p1 = γ_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4)c = m_e c sqrt(15). But actually, a faster way to compute momentum for relativistic particles is p = γ m v, but another relation is p = E v / c². Let me check that.

Yes, p = γ m v = γ m c β (where β = v/c) and E = γ m c², so p = (E / c²) * β c = E β / c. So maybe p = E β / c. So for the electron:

E1 = 4 m_e c²

β1 = v_e / c = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682

So p1 = (4 m_e c²) * (sqrt(15)/4) / c = m_e c sqrt(15)/1 ≈ 3.872 m_e c.

But check that. Wait, if γ = 4, then p = γ m v = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4)c = m_e c sqrt(15). That's 3.872 m_e c. Sounds right.

Similarly for the positron (particle 2):

γ = 2, so E2 = 2 m_e c²

v_p is (sqrt(3)/2)c. Then p2 = 2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2)c = m_e c sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732 m_e c.

But wait, a positron has the same mass as an electron, so m_e is the same. However, since the positron is moving from the right, its momentum is in the opposite direction. So p2 would be negative if we take the electron's direction (left to right) as positive. Wait, the electron is moving from left to right, positron from right to left. If we take the electron's direction as positive x-axis, then positron's velocity is in the negative x direction, hence momentum is negative.

Wait, maybe we need to clarify the coordinate system. Let's assume that the electron is moving along the positive x-axis (from left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-axis (from right to left). Therefore, their momenta are in opposite directions.

Therefore, total initial momentum is p1 (positive) plus p2 (negative). So total p_initial = p1 - p2. Since p1 = γ_e m_e v_e = sqrt(15) m_e c ≈ 3.872 m_e c, and p2 = γ_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2)c = sqrt(3) m_e c ≈ 1.732 m_e c.

But the positron's velocity is in the negative x-direction, so its momentum is - p2 = - sqrt(3) m_e c. Therefore, total initial momentum is p1 + (-p2_initial) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c. Wait, no, no, if the positron is moving from the right, its velocity is negative, so the momentum is negative. So the initial momentum would be p1 - p2, with p1 and p2 magnitudes. Wait, but actually, when being precise: p_initial_total = p_e (electron's momentum) + p_p (positron's momentum) = (γ_e m_e v_e) * î + (γ_p m_e v_p) * (-î). So yes, p_initial_total = (γ_e v_e - γ_p v_p) m_e î / c? Wait, not sure.

Wait, maybe better to do with variables properly. Let's let the electron be moving in the +x direction with speed u, so its momentum is p_e = γ_e m_e u. The positron is moving in the -x direction with speed v, so its momentum is p_p = γ_p m_e (-v). So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = γ_e m_e u - γ_p m_e v. Then in terms of c, perhaps better to use β factors. So u = β_e c, v = β_p c. So total momentum is γ_e m_e β_e c - γ_p m_e

Imagine there's an intriguing scenario involving an electron and a positron, both travelling along a horizontal path, with the electron approaching from the left boasting a Lorentz factor of 4, while the positron comes from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. As they collide, a fascinating event unfolds: the particles annihilate, giving birth to a pair of photons with identical energies. These photons embark on their own journeys, one venturing upper-right and the other lower-right. The enigma at hand is to determine the angle that separates the paths of these two photons. Let's embark on a step-by-step exploration to unravel this mystery.

To begin, let's revisit the concept of the Lorentz factor, denoted by γ, which is defined as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). In our scenario, the electron boasts a γ of 4, while the positron has a γ of 2. Since we're dealing with a collision and subsequent annihilation, the fundamental laws of conservation must hold true—both energy and momentum must be preserved. Photons, being massless entities, have their energies intrinsically linked to their momentum via the relation E = pc, where p represents the magnitude of the momentum vector.

The problem statement reveals that both photons possess equal energies, which implies that their momenta must also have the same magnitude. However, their directions differ: one photon travels upper-right, while the other ventures lower-right. The crux of the question lies in determining the angle between these two directions.

Given that the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, they inherently possess both x and y components of momentum. However, since the total momentum before the collision was entirely along the x-axis (as both the electron and positron were moving along the horizontal axis), the total momentum after the collision must also be confined to the x-axis. This constraint dictates that the y-components of the photons' momenta must cancel each other out. Furthermore, since the two photons have the same energy (and consequently, the same magnitude of momentum), their y-components must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, one photon's y-component points upwards, while the other's points downwards, forming a symmetric configuration.

Let's pause for a moment to consider the implications of the problem's statement that one photon travels upper-right and the other lower-right. This means that their y-components are opposite, but they both possess x-components in the positive direction, as right signifies the positive x-axis. Consequently, after the collision, the two photons move towards the right but at specific angles above and below the horizontal axis. Therefore, their angles with respect to the x-axis must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. If one photon forms an angle θ above the x-axis, the other must form an angle θ below. As a result, the angle between the photons would be 2θ. Thus, the problem simplifies to finding θ and then doubling its value.

To determine θ, we must rely on the conservation of energy and momentum.

Let's start by computing the energies and momenta of the electron and positron before the collision.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc². The momentum is expressed as p = γmv. Let's recall the relationship between γ and velocity. Since γ = 4 for the electron, we can express its velocity as v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c. Similarly, for the positron with γ = 2, its velocity v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)c.

However, we may not need the velocities immediately. Let's first focus on calculating the energies and momenta.

For the electron (particle 1):
E1 = γ_e * m_e c² = 4 * m_e c²
Momentum p1 = γ_e m_e v_e. We can compute p1 using the velocity expression v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c. Substituting this, we get p1 = γ_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4)c = m_e c sqrt(15). However, there is a more efficient method to calculate momentum for relativistic particles: p = γ m v. Another useful relation is p = E v / c². Let's verify this.

Indeed, p = γ m v = γ m c β (where β = v/c), and E = γ m c². Therefore, p = (E / c²) * β c = E β / c. So, perhaps we can use the relation p = E β / c. For the electron:

E1 = 4 m_e c²

β1 = v_e / c = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682

Thus, p1 = (4 m_e c²) * (sqrt(15)/4) / c = m_e c sqrt(15)/1 ≈ 3.872 m_e c.

Let's double-check this result. If γ = 4, then p = γ m v = 4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4)c = m_e c sqrt(15), which equals 3.872 m_e c. It seems correct.

Following the same approach for the positron (particle 2):

γ = 2, so E2 = 2 m_e c²

The positron's velocity v_p is (sqrt(3)/2)c. Consequently, p2 = 2 m_e * (sqrt(3)/2)c = m_e c sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732 m_e c.

It's important to note that a positron has the same mass as an electron, so m_e remains unchanged. However, since the positron is moving from the right, its momentum is in the opposite direction. If we consider the electron's direction (left to right) as positive, then the positron's momentum would be negative.

Let's clarify the coordinate system to avoid confusion. We'll assume that the electron is moving along the positive x-axis (from

There is a scenario involving an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. Both particles move along the horizontal axis, with the electron traveling from the left and having a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron approaching from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. Post-collision, they generate two photons of equal energy, one moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. The task is to determine the angle between the trajectories of the two photons.

To begin, the Lorentz factor γ is defined as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For the electron, γ equals 4, and for the positron, it equals 2. During this event, both energy and momentum are conserved. Since photons are massless, their energy is directly related to their momentum through the equation E = pc, where p is the momentum's magnitude.

The problem states that both photons possess equal energy, implying their momenta are identical in magnitude. Despite this, their directions differ: one photon moves upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between these paths.

Considering that the total pre-collision momentum was aligned along the x-axis, due to the electron and positron both traveling along this axis, the post-collision momentum must also align with the x-axis. Thus, the photons' y-components of momentum must cancel each other out. With equal energy, their momenta's y-components are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction; one moves upward, the other downward. Given they're moving to the right, the photons have positive x-components. Consequently, their angles relative to the x-axis must be equal but opposite. Therefore, if one photon is at angle θ above the x-axis, the other is at θ below, meaning the angle between them is 2θ. We need to determine θ and then double it.

To find θ, we apply the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.

First, let's calculate the energies and momenta of the electron and positron before they collide.

The energy of a relativistic particle is E = γmc², and momentum is p = γmv. γ relates to velocity as γ = 4 for the electron, giving velocity v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c. Similarly, for the positron with γ = 2, v_p = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)c.

For the electron:
E1 = γ_e * m_e c² = 4 * m_e c²
Momentum p1 = γ_e m_e v_e = m_e c sqrt(15).

For the positron:
E2 = γ = 2, so E2 = 2 m_e c²
Momentum p2 = γ_p m_e v_p = m_e c sqrt(3).

Since the positron moves in the opposite direction to the electron, its momentum will be negative when considering the positive x-direction. Thus, the total initial momentum is the difference between the electron's and the positron's momenta, p_initial = p1 - p2. Therefore, we have:

p_initial = (m_e c sqrt(15) - m_e c sqrt(3)).

Now let's establish a coordinate system: the electron moves in the positive x-direction, and the positron moves in the negative x-direction. The total initial momentum, therefore, is given by:

p_initial_total = γ_e m_e v_e - γ_p m_e v_p.

This setup allows us to solve for the angles of the photons using momentum conservation principles.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Given an electron and a positron moving towards each other along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors 4 and 2 respectively, they annihilate into two photons with equal energies. We need to determine the angle between the directions of these photons.

1. **Energy and Momentum Calculation**:
   - The energy of the electron: \( E_e = \gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 \)
   - The energy of the positron: \( E_p = \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2 \)
   - Total energy: \( E_{\text{total}} = E_e + E_p = 6 m_e c^2 \)
   - Each photon's energy: \( E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2 \)
   - Momentum of each photon: \( p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c \)

2. **Initial Momentum Calculation**:
   - Electron's momentum: \( p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = \sqrt{15} m_e c \)
   - Positron's momentum (negative direction): \( p_p = \sqrt{3} m_e c \)
   - Total initial momentum: \( p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c \)

3. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   - Photons' momenta in the x-direction: \( 6 m_e c \cos\theta \)
   - Equate to initial momentum: \( 6 m_e c \cos\theta = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c \)
   - Solving for \( \cos\theta \): \( \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx 0.3568 \)
   - Angle \( \theta \approx 69^\circ \)

4. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The angle between the two photons is \( 2\theta \approx 2 \times 69^\circ = 138^\circ \)

Thus, the angle between the directions of the photons is \(\boxed{138^\circ}\).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

β_p c.

But energies are E_e = γ_e m_e c² and E_p = γ_p m_e c². Then total energy is E_total = (γ_e + γ_p) m_e c².

After annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon. Since they have the same energy, E_photon1 = E_photon2 = E. So total energy after annihilation is 2E. Therefore, conservation of energy gives 2E = (γ_e + γ_p) m_e c². Therefore, E = [(γ_e + γ_p)/2] m_e c². Given that γ_e = 4 and γ_p = 2, this gives E = (4 + 2)/2 * m_e c² = 3 m_e c². So each photon has energy 3 m_e c².

Now, conservation of momentum. Before collision, the total momentum is p_initial = γ_e m_e u - γ_p m_e v. Wait, but u and v are speeds. Wait, since the electron is moving in +x, speed u = β_e c, and positron moving in -x, speed v = β_p c.

But from Lorentz factors, we can relate β and γ. For the electron, γ_e = 4, so β_e = sqrt(1 - 1/γ_e²) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.968. So β_e = sqrt(15)/4. Similarly, for the positron, γ_p = 2, so β_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Therefore, p_initial = γ_e m_e β_e c - γ_p m_e β_p c = m_e c (γ_e β_e - γ_p β_p). Let's compute γ_e β_e and γ_p β_p.

For the electron: γ_e β_e = 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) = sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872.

For the positron: γ_p β_p = 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732.

So p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈ m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) ≈ 2.14 m_e c. So the total initial momentum is in the +x direction, approximately 2.14 m_e c.

After annihilation, the two photons have momentum vectors. Let's denote the momentum of the upper-right photon as p1 and the lower-right photon as p2. Since their energies are equal, their magnitudes are equal: |p1| = |p2| = E / c = 3 m_e c² / c = 3 m_e c. So each photon has momentum 3 m_e c.

Let’s denote the angle of photon 1 (upper-right) with respect to the x-axis as θ. Then photon 2 (lower-right) will have an angle of -θ. Therefore, their x-components will be p1_x = 3 m_e c cosθ and p2_x = 3 m_e c cosθ (since cosine is even). Their y-components will be p1_y = 3 m_e c sinθ and p2_y = -3 m_e c sinθ. So total momentum after annihilation:

p_total_x = 3 m_e c cosθ + 3 m_e c cosθ = 6 m_e c cosθ

p_total_y = 3 m_e c sinθ - 3 m_e c sinθ = 0

Which makes sense, since the initial momentum is all along the x-axis. Therefore, conservation of momentum gives:

p_total_x = p_initial => 6 m_e c cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

Therefore, cosθ = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6

Let me compute that numerically:

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205

So numerator ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093

Divide by 6: ≈ 0.35682

So cosθ ≈ 0.35682

Then θ ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, arccos(0.3568) is approximately 69 degrees. Let me check:

cos(60°) = 0.5

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420

cos(69°) ≈ 0.3584

0.3568 is close to 69 degrees. So θ ≈ 69 degrees. Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees.

But let me check that again. If each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis, then the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees. So approximately 138 degrees. But let's compute the exact value.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute θ using exact expressions.

cosθ = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6

But is there a better way to write this? Maybe rationalize or find an exact angle?

Alternatively, perhaps we can square both sides to find sinθ or something else.

But since we need the angle between the photons, which is 2θ, so maybe we can compute cos(2θ) to find the angle.

Using the double-angle formula:

cos(2θ) = 2 cos²θ - 1

We already know cosθ = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6

Compute cos²θ:

[ (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6 ]² = [15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(45) ] / 36

= [18 - 2*sqrt(9*5)] / 36

= [18 - 6 sqrt(5) ] / 36

= [18 - 6 sqrt(5)] / 36

= [3 - sqrt(5)] / 6

Therefore, cos(2θ) = 2*( [3 - sqrt(5)] / 6 ) - 1 = [ (3 - sqrt(5)) / 3 ] - 1 = (3 - sqrt(5) - 3)/3 = (-sqrt(5))/3 ≈ -2.236 / 3 ≈ -0.745

Therefore, cos(2θ) ≈ -0.745, so 2θ ≈ arccos(-0.745). Let's compute that.

arccos(-0.745) is in the second quadrant. Let's see:

cos(135°) ≈ -0.7071

cos(140°) ≈ -0.7660

So, -0.745 is between 135° and 140°. Let me compute:

cos(138°) ≈ cos(135 + 3) = cos135 cos3 - sin135 sin3 ≈ (-0.7071)(0.9986) - (0.7071)(0.0523) ≈ -0.7068 - 0.0370 ≈ -0.7438

So, arccos(-0.745) ≈ 138 degrees. So 2θ ≈ 138 degrees.

Therefore, the angle between the two photons is approximately 138 degrees.

But let me verify once again the steps to make sure there was no error.

1. Calculated energies of electron and positron: E_e = 4 m_e c², E_p = 2 m_e c². Total energy: 6 m_e c². Thus, each photon has energy 3 m_e c². So their momenta are E/c = 3 m_e c. Correct.

2. Calculated initial momentum. For electron, p_e = γ_e m_e v_e. With γ_e = 4, v_e = sqrt(15)/4 c. So p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e c sqrt(15). Similarly, for positron, p_p = γ_p m_e v_p. γ_p = 2, v_p = sqrt(3)/2 c. So p_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c) = m_e c sqrt(3). But since positron is moving in the opposite direction, total initial momentum is p_e - p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)). Correct.

3. After annihilation, photons have equal energy and opposite y-components. So each photon's momentum is 3 m_e c. Total x-momentum from both photons is 2 * 3 m_e c * cosθ. Equate to initial momentum: 6 m_e c cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), leading to cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 ≈ 0.3568, θ ≈ 69°, angle between photons is 2θ ≈ 138°. All steps seem correct.

Thus, the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees. But the question might expect an exact answer in terms of inverse cosine or something, but since the problem mentions "the angle", and given that it's a numerical value, probably expects the exact value in degrees or an exact expression.

But since we were able to write cos(2θ) = -sqrt(5)/3, which is -sqrt(5)/3 ≈ -0.745, but actually earlier step:

Wait, when we computed cos(2θ) = 2 cos²θ - 1, then with cos²θ = [ (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))² ] / 36 = (15 + 3 - 2 sqrt(45))/36 = (18 - 6 sqrt(5))/36 = (3 - sqrt(5))/6. So then 2 cos²θ = (3 - sqrt(5))/3. Then 2 cos²θ - 1 = (3 - sqrt(5))/3 - 1 = (3 - sqrt(5) - 3)/3 = (- sqrt(5))/3. So cos(2θ) = -sqrt(5)/3 ≈ -2.236/3 ≈ -0.745. Therefore, 2θ = arccos(-sqrt(5)/3). Therefore, the exact angle is arccos(-sqrt(5)/3). But maybe it's better to rationalize this.

Alternatively, maybe this angle is 180° - arccos(sqrt(5)/3). But sqrt(5)/3 ≈ 0.745, so arccos(0.745) is about 42°, so 180 - 42 = 138°. So 138 degrees.

Therefore, the angle between the two photons is arccos(-sqrt(5)/3) radians or approximately 138 degrees. But the problem says "What is the angle between the directions of the photons?" It might need an exact answer or to leave it as an expression, but since in the calculation we found approximately 138°, but let's check if this is an exact angle.

Wait, sqrt(5)/3 is not a standard cosine value, so maybe 138 degrees is the approximate answer. However, sometimes angles like 135° (which is 3/4 pi radians) are standard, but 138 is not. Alternatively, maybe it's 120°, but 120° would have cosine -0.5, but here it's -0.745, so not 120. Hence, likely the answer is arccos(-sqrt(5)/3) or approximately 138 degrees.

But let me check once more.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a trigonometric identity I missed. Let me see. Hmm. Let's note that sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) is equal to sqrt(3)(sqrt(5) - 1). So cosθ = sqrt(3)(sqrt(5) - 1)/6. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe there's a relation with the golden ratio or something else, but I don't see it.

Alternatively, perhaps express 2θ in terms of inverse cosine. But the problem states that the directions were measured, so maybe we need to give a numerical value. If so, 138 degrees is approximate. But maybe we need to compute it more accurately.

Compute [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6 ≈ (3.87298 - 1.73205)/6 ≈ (2.14093)/6 ≈ 0.35682

So θ = arccos(0.35682). Let me compute this in degrees. The arccos of 0.3568. Let's recall that cos(60°) = 0.5, cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420, so 0.3568 is between 60° and 70°. Let's use linear approximation between 60° and 70°.

At 60°: 0.5

At 70°: ~0.3420

Difference of 10° corresponds to decrease of ~0.158. We have 0.3568 - 0.3420 = 0.0148. So 0.0148 / 0.158 ≈ 0.0936. So 70° - 0.0936*10° ≈ 70° - 0.936° ≈ 69.064°. So θ ≈ 69.064°, so 2θ ≈ 138.128°, so approximately 138.13 degrees.

Therefore, rounding to the nearest degree, 138 degrees. Alternatively, the problem might accept 135°, but that's a guess. However, given the precise calculation, it's approximately 138 degrees. Let me check using a calculator:

Compute cosθ = 0.35682, so θ ≈ 69.06°, 2θ ≈ 138.12°, yes.

Alternatively, if using a calculator:

arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69.0°, so 2θ ≈ 138.0°, as the approximate angle.

But in the problem, since it's a physics problem, and angles are often given to the nearest degree or sometimes in exact terms, but here, since the problem mentions Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, which are exact, but the answer might be expected in exact terms. Wait, but sqrt(15) and sqrt(3) are irrational, so unless there's a trigonometric identity, the angle is irrational in terms of pi. Therefore, probably the answer is either expressed as arccos(-sqrt(5)/3) radians, or approximately 138 degrees.

But the problem says "What is the angle between the directions of the photons?" So probably expects a numerical value. Let me check if the calculation is correct once more.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the assumption that the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right. Wait, the problem says "one of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction." So both photons are moving to the right. But in the center-of-momentum frame, the photons would be emitted in opposite directions. However, in this case, since the initial total momentum is not zero, the photons must both be moving to the right, but at angles above and below the x-axis. But how does that conserve momentum?

Wait, if the total initial momentum is to the right, then the total momentum of the photons must also be to the right. So yes, both photons have x-components of momentum to the right, and their y-components cancel. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, if the photons were back-to-back in the center-of-mass frame, but in the lab frame, they would be moving in different directions. However, in this problem, they are both moving to the right, which is interesting. So the angle between them is the angle between two vectors in the right half-plane, one above and one below the x-axis. So, for example, if one is at +θ and the other at -θ, the angle between them is 2θ.

But yes, the calculation seems consistent. So the answer is approximately 138 degrees. Therefore, I think the angle is 138 degrees, so the boxed answer would be \boxed{138^\circ} or if in radians, but the problem doesn't specify. Since it's about directions measured, likely degrees. So \boxed{138^\circ}

**Final Answer**
The angle between the directions of the photons is \boxed{138^\circ}.

Given an electron and a positron moving towards each other along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors 4 and 2 respectively, they annihilate to produce two photons with equal energies. The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions. We need to determine the angle between these photons.

1. **Energy and Momentum Conservation**:
   - The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = 4m_e c^2 + 2m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2
     \]
   - Each photon has energy \(3m_e c^2\), hence their momenta are \(p_{\text{photon}} = 3m_e c\).

2. **Momentum Components**:
   - The total initial momentum along the x-axis is:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = p_1 - p_2 = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]
   - After annihilation, the x-components of the photons' momenta must sum to the initial momentum:
     \[
     2 \cdot 3m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
     \]
   - Solving for \(\cos\theta\):
     \[
     \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
     \]

3. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Using the double-angle formula for cosine:
     \[
     \cos(2\theta) = 2\cos^2\theta - 1 = 2\left(\frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}\right)^2 - 1 = -\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}
     \]
   - The angle \(2\theta\) is found using the arccosine function:
     \[
     2\theta = \arccos\left(-\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right) \approx 138.19^\circ
     \]

Thus, the angle between the directions of the photons is \(\boxed{138^\circ}\).

left to right), and the positron is moving along the negative x-axis (from right to left). Therefore, the electron's momentum is positive, and the positron's momentum is negative. However, since the positron's velocity is directed to the left, its momentum vector is negative. Therefore, the total initial momentum is p1 (electron) + p2 (positron) = p1 - |p2|.

Wait, but let's confirm the directions. If the electron is moving from the left to the right (positive x-direction), its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from the right to the left (negative x-direction), so its momentum is negative. Therefore, the total initial momentum is p1 (positive) + p2 (negative) = p1 - |p2|.

But let's compute the numerical values.

First, compute p1 and p2:

p1 = γ_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4)c = m_e c sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872 m_e c

p2 = γ_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e (sqrt(3)/2)c = m_e c sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732 m_e c

But since the positron is moving in the negative x-direction, its momentum is -p2 = -m_e c sqrt(3)

Therefore, total initial momentum P_initial = p1 - p2 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈ m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) ≈ 2.14 m_e c

Total initial energy E_initial = E1 + E2 = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c²

After annihilation, the system consists of two photons. Each photon has energy E_photon1 and E_photon2. The problem states that both photons have the same energy, so E_photon1 = E_photon2 = E. Therefore, total energy after annihilation is 2E = 6 m_e c² ⇒ E = 3 m_e c².

Each photon's momentum is p_photon = E / c = 3 m_e c² / c = 3 m_e c. However, momentum is a vector quantity. The photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, so their momentum vectors have both x and y components.

Let’s denote the angle each photon makes with the x-axis as θ (upper-right photon) and -θ (lower-right photon). Therefore, the x-components of their momenta are p_photon_x = p_photon cosθ and p_photon_x = p_photon cosθ, respectively. The y-components are p_photon_y = p_photon sinθ and p_photon_y = -p_photon sinθ.

Since the total momentum after collision must equal the total momentum before collision, which was P_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈ 2.14 m_e c along the x-axis, and zero in the y-direction.

Therefore, summing the x-components of the photons' momenta:

Total P_x_after = p_photon cosθ + p_photon cosθ = 2 p_photon cosθ

Similarly, total P_y_after = p_photon sinθ - p_photon sinθ = 0, which satisfies the conservation of momentum in the y-direction.

Setting P_x_after equal to P_initial:

2 p_photon cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))

But we know that p_photon = E / c = 3 m_e c² / c = 3 m_e c

Therefore:

2 * 3 m_e c * cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

Thus:

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6

Compute the numerical value:

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872 - 1.732 ≈ 2.14

Therefore, cosθ ≈ 2.14 / 6 ≈ 0.3567

Now, θ = arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69 degrees

Therefore, the angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees

But let's check this calculation again step by step to ensure accuracy.

First, confirm the energies:

Total energy before annihilation: E_initial = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c²

Each photon has energy 3 m_e c², so p_photon = 3 m_e c² / c = 3 m_e c. Correct.

Total momentum before annihilation: P_initial = p1 - p2 = m_e c sqrt(15) - m_e c sqrt(3) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈ m_e c (3.872 - 1.732) ≈ 2.14 m_e c. Correct.

Total momentum after annihilation: 2 p_photon cosθ = 2 * 3 m_e c * cosθ = 6 m_e c cosθ

Setting equal to P_initial:

6 m_e c cosθ = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

Thus, cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 ≈ (3.872 - 1.732)/6 ≈ 2.14/6 ≈ 0.3567

Taking arccos(0.3567):

Using a calculator, arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69 degrees (since cos(60°) = 0.5, cos(90°) = 0, so 0.3567 is between 60° and 90°, closer to 60°. Let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, compute θ = arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6)

Let me compute this exactly:

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872983346

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732050808

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872983346 - 1.732050808 ≈ 2.140932538

Divide by 6: 2.140932538 / 6 ≈ 0.35682209

Now, arccos(0.35682209):

Using calculator input:

cos⁻¹(0.35682209) ≈ 69.1 degrees

Therefore, θ ≈ 69.1°, so the angle between the two photons is 2θ ≈ 138.2°, which is approximately 138 degrees.

But let's check if this answer makes sense. If the photons are emitted symmetrically above and below the x-axis with angles θ and -θ, then the angle between them is indeed 2θ. So, if θ is approximately 69°, then the angle between them is approximately 138°, which seems reasonable.

However, let's verify if there's a possible mistake in the assumption that both photons have equal angles. Since the problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, symmetry suggests that their angles relative to the x-axis are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Therefore, the angle between them is indeed 2θ. Hence, our calculation seems correct.

But let's consider another approach to cross-validate.

Alternative approach:

In the center-of-momentum frame, the total initial momentum is zero. However, in this problem, the initial momenta of the electron and positron are not equal, so the center-of-momentum frame is moving relative to the lab frame. However, since photons are emitted, their directions in different frames can be related via Lorentz transformations. However, this approach might complicate things, but let's see.

Alternatively, since the problem states that the photons have equal energies and are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions, perhaps we can consider that in the center-of-mass frame, the photons would be emitted in opposite directions (back-to-back) with 180° between them. However, due to the motion of the center-of-mass frame relative to the lab frame, the angle between them would be altered. However, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps using vector addition.

Total momentum before collision: P_initial = p1 (electron) + p2 (positron) = p1 - |p2| (since positron is moving left)

After collision, photons have momenta p_photon1 and p_photon2, each with magnitude 3 m_e c, directions making angles θ and -θ with the x-axis.

Therefore, vectorially:

p_photon1 = 3 m_e c (cosθ i + sinθ j)

p_photon2 = 3 m_e c (cosθ i - sinθ j)

Total momentum after collision:

P_after = p_photon1 + p_photon2 = 3 m_e c (2 cosθ i + 0 j) = 6 m_e c cosθ i

Equate to P_initial:

6 m_e c cosθ i = (p1 - |p2|) i

Therefore,

6 m_e c cosθ = p1 - |p2|

But p1 = sqrt(15) m_e c, |p2| = sqrt(3) m_e c

Thus,

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

Which is the same equation as before. Therefore, θ ≈ 69.1°, angle between photons ≈ 138.2°, which rounds to approximately 138 degrees.

But let's check if there's a possible mistake here. Wait, the problem states that the positron is moving from the right, so in our coordinate system, the positron's momentum is negative. Therefore, P_initial = p1 (electron) + p2 (positron) = p1 - |p2|. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame and analyze the problem from there, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, let's check the energy and momentum conservation again.

Energy conservation:

E_initial = 6 m_e c²

E_photon1 + E_photon2 = 2 * 3 m_e c² = 6 m_e c². Correct.

Momentum conservation:

P_initial = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c ≈ 2.14 m_e c

P_after = 6 m_e c cosθ ≈ 6 m_e c * 0.3568 ≈ 2.14 m_e c. Correct.

Therefore, the calculations are consistent.

But let's think about the angle. If each photon is moving at θ ≈ 69° from the x-axis, then the angle between them is 2θ ≈ 138°, which is an obtuse angle. However, photons produced in electron-positron annihilation typically are emitted in opposite directions in the center-of-mass frame. However, in this case, since the collision is not head-on with equal and opposite momenta (since the electron and positron have different Lorentz factors), the center-of-mass frame is moving, leading to the photons not being back-to-back in the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach using relativistic invariants. The invariant mass squared is (E_total/c²)² - (p_total)² = (sum E/c²)² - (sum p)². For the initial system, the invariant mass squared is:

(E1 + E2)^2 / c^4 - (p1 - p2)^2 = (6 m_e c²)^2 / c^4 - (sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c)^2 / c^2

Simplify:

= 36 m_e² c^4 / c^4 - m_e² c² (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))² / c²

= 36 m_e² - m_e² (15 - 2 sqrt(45) + 3)

= 36 m_e² - m_e² (18 - 6 sqrt(5))

= 36 m_e² - 18 m_e² + 6 sqrt(5) m_e²

= 18 m_e² + 6 sqrt(5) m_e² ≈ 18 m_e² + 13.416 m_e² ≈ 31.416 m_e²

But the invariant mass squared should also equal the sum of the energies and momenta of the photons. However, photons are massless, so the invariant mass squared is (E1 + E2)^2 / c^4 - (p1 + p2)^2. But since photons are massless, their invariant mass squared is zero. Wait, but here we have two photons; the invariant mass squared of the system is (sum E/c²)^2 - (sum p)^2. Let's compute that.

For the two photons:

E_photon1 = E_photon2 = 3 m_e c²

Total energy: 6 m_e c²

Total momentum: vector sum is 6 m_e c cosθ i

Therefore, invariant mass squared:

(6 m_e c² / c²)^2 - (6 m_e c cosθ / c)^2 = (6 m_e)^2 - (6 m_e cosθ)^2 = 36 m_e² (1 - cos²θ) = 36 m_e² sin²θ

But this must equal the invariant mass squared computed earlier, which was approximately 31.416 m_e². Therefore:

36 sin²θ ≈ 31.416

sin²θ ≈ 31.416 / 36 ≈ 0.8727

sinθ ≈ sqrt(0.8727) ≈ 0.9342

θ ≈ arcsin(0.9342) ≈ 69.1°, which matches our previous result. Therefore, θ ≈ 69.1°, angle between photons ≈ 138.2°, confirming our earlier conclusion.

Therefore, the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees. However, let's check if the problem expects an exact value or a numerical approximation. The problem states that the Lorentz factors are 4 and 2, which are integers, so perhaps there's an exact expression.

Let's attempt to find an exact expression for θ.

We have:

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6

We can rationalize this expression or express it in terms of known angles, but it's unlikely to correspond to a standard angle. Alternatively, perhaps we can square both sides to find sinθ.

Alternatively, compute the exact angle in terms of inverse trigonometric functions. However, since the problem doesn't specify the need for an exact expression, and given that the numerical value is approximately 138 degrees, we can present the answer as such. However, let's verify if 138.2° is the precise value.

Alternatively, compute the exact value using more precise calculations.

Compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872983346207417

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.7320508075688772

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.872983346207417 - 1.7320508075688772 ≈ 2.14093253863854

Divide by 6: 2.14093253863854 / 6 ≈ 0.35682208977309

cosθ ≈ 0.35682208977309

Now, using a calculator to find arccos(0.35682208977309):

Using a calculator, arccos(0.35682208977309) ≈ 69.0948°, which is approximately 69.1°, so 2θ ≈ 138.19°, which rounds to 138.2°. Therefore, the angle between the photons is approximately 138.2 degrees.

However, the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of inverse cosine or a simplified radical expression. Let's see if we can express θ in terms of inverse trigonometric functions with exact arguments.

Given cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6, we can leave theccos((ccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6), but the problem asks for the angle between the directions of the photons, which is 2θ. Therefore, the exact answer would be 2 arccos((sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6). However, this is not a standard angle, so likely the answer expects a numerical value. Given that in physics problems, angles are often expressed to the nearest degree unless specified otherwise, 138 degrees is a reasonable approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a trigonometric identity that allows us to compute 2θ without computing θ first. Let's explore this.

We have cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6

We can compute cos(2θ) using the double-angle formula:

cos(2θ) = 2cos²θ - 1

First, compute cos²θ:

cos²θ = [(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6]^2 = (15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(15)*sqrt(3))/36 = (18 - 2*sqrt(45))/36 = (18 - 6*sqrt(5))/36 = (3 - sqrt(5))/6

Therefore,

cos(2θ) = 2*(3 - sqrt(5))/6 - 1 = (3 - sqrt(5))/3 - 1 = (3 - sqrt(5) - 3)/3 = (-sqrt(5))/3 ≈ -2.236/3 ≈ -0.745

Therefore, cos(2θ) ≈ -0.745

Thus, 2θ = arccos(-0.745) ≈ 138.2°, which matches our previous result. Therefore, the angle between the photons is arccos(-sqrt(5)/3), which is an exact expression, but numerically it's approximately 138.2 degrees.

However, the problem might expect the answer in terms of inverse cosine, but given the context, a numerical answer is more likely expected. Therefore, the angle between the photons is approximately 138 degrees. However, to ensure precision, let's compute it more accurately.

Compute cos(2θ) = -sqrt(5)/3 ≈ -2.2360679775/3 ≈ -0.7453559925

Now, arccos(-0.7453559925):

Using a calculator, arccos(-0.7453559925) ≈ 138.19 degrees, which rounds to 138.2 degrees. In many cases, angles are rounded to the nearest whole degree unless specified otherwise. Therefore, the answer is approximately 138 degrees.

But let's verify once more with precise calculation.

Using a calculator:

cos(138.19°) ≈ cos(138°) ≈ cos(180° - 42°) = -cos(42°) ≈ -0.7431, which is close to -0.7453. The discrepancy arises because 138.19° is slightly larger than 138°. Let's compute the exact value:

Let’s find x where cos(x) = -sqrt(5)/3 ≈ -0.7453559925

Using a calculator's inverse cosine function:

x ≈ 138.1896851 degrees

Therefore, the angle between the photons is approximately 138.19 degrees, which can be reasonably presented as 138.2 degrees or, rounding to the nearest degree, 138 degrees.

Given that physics problems often accept one decimal place, 138.2° is appropriate. However, the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of arccos(-sqrt(5)/3), but since the question asks for the angle and doesn't specify the form, the numerical value is likely expected.

Therefore, the angle between the directions of the photons is approximately 138 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The angle between the directions of the photons is \boxed{138^\circ}.

The electron and positron collide and annihilate into two photons with equal energy and opposite directions relative to the x-axis. The key steps are:

1. **Energy Conservation**: The total initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
   \]
   Each photon has energy \(E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2\).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The total initial momentum is the difference between the momenta of the electron and positron (since they move in opposite directions).
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \sqrt{15} m_e c - \sqrt{3} m_e c = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
   \]

3. **Photon Momenta**: Each photon's momentum magnitude is \(3 m_e c\). The x-components of the photons' momenta must sum to the initial momentum.
   \[
   2 \cdot 3 m_e c \cos \theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})
   \]
   Solving for \(\cos \theta\):
   \[
   \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
   \]

4. **Angle Calculation**: Calculate \(\theta\) and double it to find the angle between the photons.
   \[
   \theta \approx \arccos\left(\frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}\right) \approx 69.1^\circ
   \]
   The angle between the photons is \(2\theta \approx 138^\circ\).

Thus, the angle between the directions of the photons is \(\boxed{138^\circ}\).

However, after the annihilation, the photons must balance both energy and momentum. Let the energy of each photon be E_photon. The total after energy is 2E_photon (since there are two photons of equal energy). The initial energy is E1 + E2 = 4 m_e c² + 2 m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

Thus, conservation of energy:

2E_photon = 6 m_e c²

E_photon = 3 m_e c².

Each photon has energy E_photon = 3 m_e c². However, since photons carry momentum p_photon = E_photon / c. Therefore, each photon's momentum magnitude is 3 m_e c.

Now consider that the momentum vectors of the photons must add up to the initial total momentum. If the two photons are moving at angles θ and -θ relative to the x-axis, their y-components cancel out. Their x-components add up. The total x-component of the photons' momentum (each being 3 m_e c * cosθ) times 2 must equal the total initial momentum's x-component, which is p_initial:

2 * [3 m_e c * cosθ] = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Simplifying:

6 cosθ = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / 6

Then θ = arccos[(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6]

We calculate (sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205)

Numerator: 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093

Therefore:

cosθ ≈ 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.3568

Now taking arccos:

θ ≈ arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees

Thus, the angle between the two photons would be 138 degrees (2θ), but need to verify this step-by-step.

But wait, we need to check if arccos(0.3568) is roughly 69 degrees.

Because cos(60°) ≈ 0.5

cos(60) = 0.5, so 0.3568 is smaller, implying the angle is larger. Say, cos(70) ≈ 0.3420. Then 0.3568 – 0.3420 = 0.0148. So between 69°, given cos69≈0.3584. Since 0.3568 is close, angle is approximately 69.0 degrees. So 2θ≈138 degrees.

But perhaps exact calculation needed, but maybe there's an exact angle. Wait, sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)/6 is the cosine of the angle. Let's square that:

[(sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6]^2

= (15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(45))/36

= (18 - 6*sqrt(5))/36

= (3 - sqrt(5))/6 ≈ (3 - 2.236)/6 ≈ 0.764 /6 ≈ 0.127; wait that is not matching.

Wait, (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))^2 equals 15 + 3 - 2*sqrt(15*3) = 18 - 2*sqrt(45) = 18 - 6*sqrt(5).

Therefore yes, but since cos(theta) ≈ 0.3568 corresponds to approximately 69 degrees as stated.

Therefore, angle between the photons is 2θ ≈ 138 degrees.

But wait, maybe need exact value?

Alternatively, think about sin and cosine components. Since 69 degrees is a way of approximating. However, perhaps do proper atan.

Alternatively, compute theta:

cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 ≈ let me compute sqrt(15): ~3.87298, sqrt(3) ~1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.3568. Then, as cosine, take arccos. To find the exact fraction.

Alternatively, can we rationalize this expression?

Let's take effort to calculate the exact value.

Compute θ = arccos((√15 − √3)/6)

Note that cosθ = (√15 − √3)/6. So θ is given as such.

To find angle in radians or exact terms is challenging; perhaps convert to an exact expression.

Alternatively, observe that (√15 − √3)/6 can perhaps be associated with a known angle. Let me check possible angles:

Let's square both sides:

cos²θ = [ (√15 - √3) /6 ]^2 = (15 + 3 - 2√45)/36 = (18 - 6√5)/36 = (3 - √5)/6 ≈ (3 - 2.23607)/6 ≈ (0.76393)/6≈ 0.12732. So cos²θ ≈ 0.12732 implies sin²θ≈ 0.87268 and sinθ≈ 0.9341, θ≈69. That correspondence is rough.

Alternatively, using more exact calculation.

Also, check that (√15 − √3)/6.

Maybe using triangles -- none appears obvious. Otherwise, we need use calculator.

Suppose using a calculator arXiv angle:

cosθ ≈ 0.35682.

Compute arccos(0.35682). If cos60=0.5, each degree is 0.01745 radians.

Calculator: take 0.35682. Standard angles:

theta:

69°: cos69≈0.3584, which is 0.3584.

66°: cos66≈0.4067.

67: 0.3907, 68:0.3746, 69:0.3584, 70:0.3420. So 0.3568 between 69 and 70 degrees. Between 69. So take:

Rooting through more precision.

Let’s say approximately, 69.1 degrees. Since 0.3568 lies between cos69 ~0.3584 so the angle is slightly more than 69 degrees. Let me difference:

cos(69.5°)= cos(70°-0.5°)≈cos70° + 0.5* (180/pi)/57.3 radians per degree? Wait.

Alternate method, linear approximation.

Let x be the angle in degrees where theta =69 + d degrees, with d <<1.

Then, using cos(theta) = cos(69 + d). Use Taylor series expansion:

cos(69 + d) ≈ cos69 - (pi/180)d sin69.

Setting equal to 0.3568:

0.3584 - (0.01745 d) * sin69 ≈0.3568

Linear approximation:

Difference needed: 0.3584 – 0.3568 = 0.0016. Thus,

(0.01745 d) * sin69 = 0.0016

Then d ≈ 0.0016 / (0.01745 * sin69)

Compute sin69≈0.93358:

Therefore,

d≈0.0016/(0.01745*0.93358) ≈0.0016/(0.01629) ≈0.098 radians?

Wait no, wait:

Wait 0.01745 is radians per degree. So this linear approximation works in radians.

Wait, actually, I need to recognize d is in There's confusion here. Linear approximation uses differentials in radians. Let me recast.

Let theta_rad = 69 degrees * π/180 ≈ 1.204 radians

calculating cos(theta_ rad + delta) ≈cos(theta_ rad) - delta * sin(theta_ rad)

So:

0.3568 ≈ cos(theta_rad) - delta * sin(theta_ rad)

But theta_rad = exact 69 degrees = 69*pi/180 ≈ 1.204 = let me compute:

69 deg * (pi rad/180) ≈1.204 rad.

Then cos(1.204)=cos(69°)≈0.3584,

sin(1.204)=sin(69°)≈0.9336.

Set up equation:

0.3568≈0.3584 - delta *0.9336

Therefore,

delta ≈ (0.3584-0.3568)/0.9336≈0.0016 /0.9336≈0.0017 radians.

Convert delta to degrees: 0.0017 rad * (180/pi) ≈0.098°.

So, the angle is approximately 69.001 + 0.098 ≈69.098 degrees. So about 69.1 degrees.

Hence, theta is approximately 69.1 degrees. Therefore, 2θ≈138.2 degrees.

Therefore, finally, angle between two photons is approximately 138 degrees, or rounded, 138. So this is acute angle.

But 180-138=42, no. Wait.

Alternatively, maybe need pi - 2*theta, but no, directions: one is upper-right, one lower-right. Their angle between them is summed.

Visualization: If one photon is going right and upwards, at theta above x-axis, and other is going right and downwards at theta below x-axis. The angle between their paths is the angle from upper to lower, rather than theta + theta. Indeed, consider two vectors: (cosθ, sinθ) and (cosθ, -sinθ). The angle between these vectors can be found by the dot product:

Dot product = cosθ * cosθ + sinθ * (-sinθ) = cos²θ - sin²θ = cos(2θ).

The angle between them is 2θ. Hmm, wait dot product is |v1||v2| cos(phi), and vectors are unit vectors since they are both photons with speed c. So since E = pc, their momentum vectors have magnitude E/c, which for equal energy also implies their momentum vectors have equal magnitude. So, the angle between them is not  more than 180 degrees. Specifically, the angle between them would be the angle between (cosθ, sinθ) and (cosθ, -sinθ), which would indeed be 2θ. Let’s check with the example, if theta is 60 degrees, then converting.

But suppose θ=60: then the angle between the two photons would be 120 degrees. Indeed, one is at 60 up, one at 60 down, total angle is 60+60=120. So that's 2θ.

But in our case, our approximation says θ≈69 degrees, so angle is 138. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe our first step is misapplied "cos(theta)" equals (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6≈0.3568, leading to theta≈69. So 2θ≈138. The actual calculation leads me to approximately 138 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe exact solution if possible.

Another approach:

The total initial momentum:

For electron with gamma=4, the velocity, beta (v/c)=sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)=sqrt(1 -1/16)=sqrt(15/16)=sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682

So momentum for electron p_e = gamma m_e v=gamma m_e beta c = 4*m_e*(sqrt(15)/4)c = m_e c sqrt(15)

Similarly, for positron, gamma=2, beta=sqrt(1 -1/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866

Momentum p_p=gamma m_e beta c=2*m_e *(sqrt(3)/2) c=m_e c sqrt(3). However, since positron moves in opposite direction, momentum is -m_e c sqrt(3) in the frame considered.

Therefore total initial momentum is p_initial=p_e -p_p= m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Total energy E_initial= gamma_e m_e c² + gamma_p m_e c²=4 m_e c² +2 m_e c²=6 m_e c².

After annihilation, two photons, each with energy E1=E2=3 m_e c², so momentum is p1_x=3 m_e c cos theta, p1_y=3 m_e c sin theta, and the second photon with p2_x=3 m_e c cos theta, p2_y=-3 m_e c sin theta.

Total momentum px= summing the x-components: 3 cos theta + 3 cos theta =6 m_e c cos theta. Total p_initial (earlier is (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Given conservation of momentum:

p_initial, x = p_final, x 

Hence,

sqrt(15 ) - sqrt(3) ), thus.

sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) =6 cos theta,

which again gives us:

cos theta = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6 ≈2.14093/6≈0.3568→theta≈69.1 degrees.

Since the angle between the two photons is 2 thete, approximately 138.2 degrees. This value is approximately 138 degrees.

But the answer requires the angle, but perhaps they use an exact value. Alternatively, perhaps invoking some trigonometric relation. Let me calculate whether (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 relates to known values.

Alternatively, express theta in terms of inverse functions. But in the problem statement, the answer likely uses a familiar angle or requires numerical value. However, likely is solving for the exact angle. But possibly we can compute this analytically.

Let us set cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3))/6。Let's rationalize this expression. Perhaps squaring both sides.

Let’s compute sqrt(15)*sqrt(3)=sqrt(45)=3*sqrt(5). No obvious product.

Alternatively, rationalizing might not help. It's probably a exact expression。

Alternatively, but basically the answer is 2 * arccos((sqrt15 - sqrt3)/6), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using a triangle for which adjacent side in the coordinate system is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)), hypotenuse in the denominator.

Alternatively, see that the expression <<so what's the answer?

But why are we getting angles near 138 degrees. Let me see if the options the problem may consider. Though exact calculation could check. But the person accordingy types in 138. But not exact.

Wait something is incongruous.

Wait, let me verify the energy and momentum calculations.

Initial energy: electron has 4m_e c², positron 2m_e c², total is 6m_e c². For two photon with E_photon=3m_e c² each. So total energy check.

Total momentum check: electron momentum: 4 m_e v_e; positron momentum (directed left): –2 m_e v_p . 

Compute velocity for electron: beta= sqrt(1 -1/γ² )= sqrt(1 -1/16)=sqrt(15)/4 . So yes p_e= γ m_e v= γ m_e beta c=4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c )= m_e c sqrt(15 ). Similarly for positron p_p=2 m_e * sqrt(3)/2 c= m_e c sqrt(3 ), directed left. So the total p_initial = sqrt(15) – sqrt(3 ), *m_e c.

Thus, photon momentum components: p_x in sum equal to p_initial. Since each photon has p =3 m_e c, with x-component p_x =3 m_e c cosθ. The two photons have same x-components. Hence 6 m_e c costheta= (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3 )) m_e c. Therefore.

cosθ=(sqrt(15) – sqrt(3 ))/6. Correct. Therefore, proceeding, as before.

Hence，theta≈69.1 degrees.

Giving an angle between? They go upper-right and lower-right. Imagine the two photons shooting off symmetrically above and below x-axis, forming an angle of 138 degrees between them.

But this seems large, but based on components possible.

Another point: maybe we need to use relativistic formulas instead of straight adding the energies and momenta.

Wait, but this is done in the lab frame where electron and positron moving towards each other with their specific velocities.

If there's a mistake, perhaps in reference frames. For example, an alternative approach might look into converting to the center of momentum frame, but might overcomplicate. Alternatively but given the problem states the energies equal and specifies they gave directions (both right and mirrored across x-axis), angle is sum of angles above and below.

Alternatively, calculate using vectors.

Total momentum pre-collision: p_initial= (p_e – p_p) in x-direction. = (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3 )) m_e c .

Photon post momenta: each photon p=3 m_e c. So sum their x-momenta:

2*3 m_e c costheta = (sqrt(15)- sqrt(3 )) m_e c ==> cosθ=(sqrt(15 ) -sqrt3 ) /6

Yes，this is about 0.3568, leading to theta≈69 degrees,so angle between photons≈138 degrees.

But perhaps test this angle.

Alternatively, if photons moves at angle phi above/-phi below the x-axis, but both to the right. Their velocity vectors make angle between them 2*phi. Which would be approximately nearly 138 degrees.

Yes, but so what is the Answer?

I believe this is how it goes. The angle between the two is 2*(about69)=138 degrees. So why isn't it exactly as per some formula?

Is there an exact solution? Probably not, since sqrt(15) and sqrt(3 ) are irrational. The angle is thus approximately 138 degrees, which could ironically relate to rights.

Alternatively, find exact formula for angle:

Given theta= arccos[(sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 ]

Thus the angle between the two photons is 2 arccos[(sqrt(15)-sqrt(3))/6 ].

Which is the exact expression, but I guess directed to approximate.

The problem, given contract to supply the answer, perhaps requires the angle expressed as 120 degrees，or a specific angle.

Wait, but maybe error if someone miscomputes. Let's check again:

If the velocities magnitudes differently set.

Alternatively, taking into account units or other factors.

Compute via.Math:

Let √.

Lorentz factor for the electron is γ1=4, so beta1= sqrt(1 -1/16)=sqrt(15/16)=sqrt(15)/4 ≈.968 .

Momentum is γ1 m_e c.beta1 ; so p1=4 m_e c*(sqrt(15)/4 )=sqrt(15)m_ec.

Momentum positive x.

For positron, γ2=2, so for β2= sqrt(1 -1/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866. So momentum p2=γ2 m_e v_p=2 m_e c*(sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(3)m_e c. But directed left.

Totalinitial momentum p_initial=p1 -p2=(sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) m_e c≈(3.873 -1.732 ) m_e c≈2.141 m_e c.

Photons each have energy 3 m_e c².

So their momenta p_photon=3 m_e c each.

Total photon momentum in x-direction:2*(3 m_e c* cosθ )

Momentum conservation in x-direction:

2*3 m_e c cosθ= (sqrt(15)−sqrt(3))m_e c

Simplify:

6 cosθ= sqrt(15)−sqrt(3)

Thus, cosθ= (sqrt(15)−sqrt(3))/6.

Again we return. Hence, the calculation yields ≈138 degrees.

Another possible inconsidement: instelta one needs convert velocity units somehow, but all steps hasher rests have velocities in units where c=1, hence should be no au issues.

Previously computed cosθ≈0.3568 ~69.1 degrees, doubled to 138.2 degrees. Therefore, approximate the answer as either 138 degrees or小数点正确.

Therefore, boxed answer as \boxed{138^\circ} orinsuch. However, is 138 accurate?

Wait calculated theta≈69.1 degrees, 2*69.1=138.2 degrees.

But in some countries, might round the angle 138 degrees; in physics, likely to use significant figures. Original parameters were given with onesignificant figure (Lorentz factors rounded), but likely accept two>,given gamma_e and gamma_p)))). ()...

The calculated answer is 138 degrees. Therefore, as per conclusion. So put it into the box.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{138^\circ}
