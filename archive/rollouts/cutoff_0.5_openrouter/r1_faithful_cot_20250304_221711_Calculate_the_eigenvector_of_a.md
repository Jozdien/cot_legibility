To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by noting that the components \(P_x\), \(P_y\), and \(P_z\) are given by the Pauli matrices scaled by \(\hbar/2\). Since the direction \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, the operator along \(\vec{n}\) is a combination of \(P_x\) and \(P_z\).

The direction vector \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane can be parameterized by an angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis, giving \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\). The operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) is then:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} (\sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta)
\]
where \(\sigma_x\) and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Combining these, the matrix for \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) becomes:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). This leads to solving the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This results in the system of equations:
1. \(\cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = a\)
2. \(\sin\theta \cdot a - \cos\theta \cdot b = b\)

Solving these equations, we find that the eigenvector is proportional to \(\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta + 1 \\ \sin\theta \end{pmatrix}\). Normalizing this vector, we use the trigonometric identities \(1 + \cos\theta = 2\cos^2(\theta/2)\) and \(\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)\), leading to the normalized eigenvector:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

Okay, I need to find the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z respectively, but since the direction is in the x-z plane, I don't think the y-component will come into play here. Wait, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero. So the operator along n would be a combination of P_x and P_z, right?

Let me start by representing the operator for an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Let's define the direction vector n. In the x-z plane, the spherical coordinates would have an angle θ from the z-axis, right? So the components of n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Therefore, the operator P·n would be P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. 

Since P_x is (ħ/2)σ_x and P_z is (ħ/2)σ_z, the operator P·n is (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ). So I can write this matrix as:

(ħ/2)[ [0, 1; 1, 0] sinθ + [1, 0; 0, -1] cosθ ]

Let me compute that. Multiplying sinθ and cosθ into the matrices:

First term for σ_x sinθ:
[0, sinθ;
sinθ, 0]

Second term for σ_z cosθ:
[cosθ, 0;
0, -cosθ]

Adding these, the total matrix is:
[cosθ, sinθ;
sinθ, -cosθ]

Then multiplied by ħ/2. However, eigenvectors are scaled by the matrix regardless of the scalar factor. So the eigenvalue equation is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ;
   sinθ, -cosθ] ] * v = (+1) * v 

Because the eigenvalue is (+ħ/2), but since the matrix is scaled by (ħ/2), the eigenvalue equation is the above. Let's write v as a two-component vector [a; b]. So:

[cosθ *a + sinθ *b]   = a
[sinθ *a - cosθ *b]   = b

So now we have two equations:

1) cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2) sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me rework equation 1:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a

Subtract a from both sides:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Subtract b from both sides:

sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

So now we have a system of linear equations:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0

sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

We can write this as a matrix equation:

[ (cosθ - 1)    sinθ        ] [a]   = [0]

[   sinθ     -(cosθ + 1)   ] [b]     [0]

To find the non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients matrix should be zero (as it's an eigenvalue problem). But since we already know this system has a non-trivial solution (because it's derived from the eigenvalue equation), we can just solve this system.

Let me take equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0 =>

[But actually, perhaps I can express the ratio a/b or b/a from one equation and substitute into the other. Let me try that.]

From equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ * b =>

a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ - 1)

Similarly, from equation 2:

sinθ * a = (cosθ + 1) * b =>

a/b = (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ

So we have:

From equation 1: a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ -1 )

From equation 2: a/b = (cosθ + 1 ) / sinθ

Therefore, set them equal:

- sinθ / (cosθ -1 ) = (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ

Cross-multiplying:

- (sinθ)^2 = (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1 )

Recall that (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1 ) = cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ.

Thus:

- sin²θ = -sin²θ

Which is an identity. So the equations are consistent, which is good. 

So we can take one equation to express a in terms of b or vice versa. Let's use equation 2 because it's maybe simpler. Equation 2: a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] * b

So set a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] * b

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to [ ( (cosθ + 1)/sinθ , 1 ) ].

But that needs to be normalized. Let me write it as:

v = [ (cosθ + 1), sinθ ]^T multiplied by some normalization constant N.

Because if we factor out (1/sinθ) then it would be:

v = N [ (cosθ +1)/sinθ ; 1 ]

But to avoid denominators, sometimes it's better to write the eigenvector components as [ (cosθ +1 ), sinθ ] then normalize.

But let me see:

Calculate the norm of v = [ (cosθ +1 ), sinθ ]

Norm squared is (cosθ +1)^2 + (sinθ)^2

Expand that:

cos²θ + 2cosθ +1 + sin²θ = (cos²θ + sin²θ) + 2cosθ +1 =1 + 2cosθ +1 = 2 + 2cosθ = 2(1 + cosθ )

So the normalization factor N would be 1 / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ ))

But perhaps it's easier to use trigonometric identities. Recall that 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So:

sqrt(2(1 + cosθ )) = sqrt(4 cos²(θ/2)) )= 2 |cos(θ/2)|. Assuming θ is between 0 and π, so cos(θ/2) is positive. So 2 cos(θ/2)

Thus, normalization factor N = 1 / (2 cos(θ/2) )

Therefore, the normalized vector would be:

[ (1 + cosθ )/(2 cos(θ/2) ), sinθ / (2 cos(θ/2) ) ]

But in terms of θ/2:

Note that 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2). Then substituting:

First component: 2 cos²(θ/2)/(2 cos(θ/2)) ) = cos(θ/2)

Second component: 2 sin (θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 cos(θ/2)) ) = sin(θ/2 )

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2); sin(θ/2) ]

Alternatively:

Wait, let me check that step again.

If I express the components:

(1 + cosθ) = 2 cos²( θ/2 )

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2 )

Therefore, substituting into the first component:

(1 + cosθ) / (2 cos(θ/2 )) = (2 cos²(θ/2 )) / (2 cos(θ/2 )) = cos(θ/2 )

Similarly, the second component sinθ / (2 cos(θ/2 )) = [2 sin(θ/2 )cos(θ/2 )] / (2 cos(θ/2 )) = sin(θ/2 )

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

v = [ cos(θ/2 ); sin(θ/2 ) ]

But we need to check if this corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But the problem states to find the eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}\cdot \vec{n}$ with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ ). Then, when we solved the eigenvalue equation, we found that spinor [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ] is an eigenvector with eigenvalue +1 when the matrix [ σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ ] acts on it. Since the operator is (ħ/2)(matrix), the eigenvalue is ħ/2* (+1). Hence yes, the normalized eigenvector is as above.

But let me verify this with θ =0, for example. Then direction is along z. The eigenvector should be [1; 0], which in θ =0 gives cos(0) = 1, sin(0) = 0. So that's correct. For θ = π, the direction is along -z, but wait, θ is angle from the z-axis. Wait, θ in this case ranges from 0 to π. For θ=π, we'd get cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2)=1, giving [0;1]. But the operator along negative z-direction is -σ_z, so eigenstate of σ_z with eigenvalue -1 (since you’d have -σ_z), but this would have eigenvector [0;1]. Which makes sense. Hmm, wait but actually, if θ=π, the direction vector is along -z. The operator would be in the direction -z, so the eigenvalues should be -ħ/2. Wait a minute, but our eigenvector found here would correspond to the eigenvalue +1 hbar/2. But when θ=π, cos(theta) = -1. So S·n becomes (sigma_x * 0 + sigma_z*(-1))*(hbar/2 ). For sigma_z, the eigenvector [1; 0] has eigenvalue +1, [0;1] has eigenvalue -1. Wait, but in our solution, when theta= pi, our spinor becomes [cos(pi/2); sin(pi/2)] = [0;1], which is the eigenvector of sigma_z with eigenvalue -1. So in that case, when we have operator (ħ/2)( -1 * sigma_z ), then from the eigenvalue equation earlier, for theta = pi, the operator (ħ/2)(sigma_x *0 + sigma_z*(-1))= - (ħ/2) sigma_z. Our supposed eigenvector [0;1] would be eigenvalue +1*(ħ/2). But wait, eigenvector [0;1] of sigma_z has eigenvalue -1, so -sigma_z would have eigenvalue +1. Hence yes, then our solution is correct. The eigenvalue in this case would be -sigma_z(ħ/2)*eigenvalue [-sigma_z] acting on [0;1] gives (1)*(ħ/2)*[0;1]. So correct.

Hence, for general theta, vector as [ cos(theta/2 ); sin(theta/2 ) ].

But need to check another angle. Let's take theta = π/2, pointing in x-direction. Then our operator would be (ħ/2) sigma_x. The eigenvector for sigma_x with eigenvalue +1 is [1;1]/sqrt(2). According to our formula, theta=pi/2 gives:

cos(pi/4 ) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(pi/4 ) = sqrt(2)/2. So the spinor is [ sqrt(2)/2 ; sqrt(2)/2 ] = 1/sqrt(2) [1;1], which is correct. So that matches. Thus it works.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ]

But theta here is the polar angle in the x-z plane, i.e., the angle between the direction n and the positive z-axis. So the answer is:

Normalized eigenvector has elements:

First element: cos(theta/2 )

Second element: sin(theta/2 )

But the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", but they don't specify theta, so perhaps we need to present the eigenvector in terms of theta, or maybe they want the answer in terms of spherical coordinates?

But I think the answer expects the normalized components in terms of theta. So [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] written in a column vector.

Alternatively, since theta is the angle from z-axis in the x-z plane, perhaps parametrize using some direction vector. Wait, but as per the problem statement, "for a muon along an arbitrary direction n", so suffice to express in terms of theta.

Alternatively, has the problem given explicit components for P_x, P_y, P_z as the Pauli matrices so the operator in direction n is P_n = sin theta P_x + cos theta P_z = (sin theta sigma_x + cos theta sigma_z ) (hbar/2 )

So, given that, solved the eigenvector property, obtained [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2 )]. Therefore, normalized, that's the answer.

But maybe the problem is implying without theta but in terms of components? Wait, maybe the question is general, so the user expects the answer to be as cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2 ) as the components. But perhaps this has to be converted into explicit form using some expressions. Wait, but since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, then verifying the answer is to present the normalized eigenvector in terms of theta.


**Final Answer**
The normalized eigenvector is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}.

Okay, I need to find the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z respectively, but since the direction is in the x-z plane, I don't think the y-component will come into play here. Wait, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero. So the operator along n would be a combination of P_x and P_z, right?

Let me start by representing the operator for an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Let's define the direction vector n. In the x-z plane, the spherical coordinates would have an angle θ from the z-axis, right? So the components of n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Therefore, the operator P·n would be P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. 

Since P_x is (ħ/2)σ_x and P_z is (ħ/2)σ_z, the operator P·n is (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ). So I can write this matrix as:

(ħ/2)[ [0, 1; 1, 0] sinθ + [1, 0; 0, -1] cosθ ]

Let me compute that. Multiplying sinθ and cosθ into the matrices:

First term for σ_x sinθ:
[0, sinθ;
sinθ, 0]

Second term for σ_z cosθ:
[cosθ, 0;
0, -cosθ]

Adding these, the total matrix is:
[cosθ, sinθ;
sinθ, -cosθ]

Then multiplied by ħ/2. However, eigenvectors are scaled by the matrix regardless of the scalar factor. So the eigenvalue equation is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ;
   sinθ, -cosθ] ] * v = (+1) * v 

Because the eigenvalue is (+ħ/2), but since the matrix is scaled by (ħ/2), the eigenvalue equation is the above. Let's write v as a two-component vector [a; b]. So:

[cosθ *a + sinθ *b]   = a
[sinθ *a - cosθ *b]   = b

So now we have two equations:

1) cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2) sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me rework equation 1:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a

Subtract a from both sides:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Subtract b from both sides:

sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

So now we have a system of linear equations:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0

sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

We can write this as a matrix equation:

[ (cosθ - 1)    sinθ        ] [a]   = [0]

[   sinθ     -(cosθ + 1)   ] [b]     [0]

To find the non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficients matrix should be zero (as it's an eigenvalue problem). But since we already know this system has a non-trivial solution (because it's derived from the eigenvalue equation), we can just solve this system.

Let me take equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0 =>

[But actually, perhaps I can express the ratio a/b or b/a from one equation and substitute into the other. Let me try that.]

From equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ * b =>

a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ - 1)

Similarly, from equation 2:

sinθ * a = (cosθ + 1) * b =>

a/b = (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ

So we have:

From equation 1: a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ -1 )

From equation 2: a/b = (cosθ + 1 ) / sinθ

Therefore, set them equal:

- sinθ / (cosθ -1 ) = (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ

Cross-multiplying:

- (sinθ)^2 = (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1 )

Recall that (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1 ) = cos²θ -1 = -sin²θ.

Thus:

- sin²θ = -sin²θ

Which is an identity. So the equations are consistent, which is good. 

So we can take one equation to express a in terms of b or vice versa. Let's use equation 2 because it's maybe simpler. Equation 2: a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] * b

So set a = [ (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ ] * b

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to [ ( (cosθ + 1)/sinθ , 1 ) ].

But that needs to be normalized. Let me write it as:

v = [ (cosθ + 1), sinθ ]^T multiplied by some normalization constant N.

Because if we factor out (1/sinθ) then it would be:

v = N [ (cosθ +1)/sinθ ; 1 ]

But to avoid denominators, sometimes it's better to write the eigenvector components as [ (cosθ +1 ), sinθ ] then normalize.

But let me see:

Calculate the norm of v = [ (cosθ +1 ), sinθ ]

Norm squared is (cosθ +1)^2 + (sinθ)^2

Expand that:

cos²θ + 2cosθ +1 + sin²θ = (cos²θ + sin²θ) + 2cosθ +1 =1 + 2cosθ +1 = 2 + 2cosθ = 2(1 + cosθ )

So the normalization factor N would be 1 / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ ))

But perhaps it's easier to use trigonometric identities. Recall that 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

So:

sqrt(2(1 + cosθ )) = sqrt(4 cos²(θ/2)) )= 2 |cos(θ/2)|. Assuming θ is between 0 and π, so cos(θ/2) is positive. So 2 cos(θ/2)

Thus, normalization factor N = 1 / (2 cos(θ/2) )

Therefore, the normalized vector would be:

[ (1 + cosθ )/(2 cos(θ/2) ), sinθ / (2 cos(θ/2) ) ]

But in terms of θ/2:

Note that 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2). Then substituting:

First component: 2 cos²(θ/2)/(2 cos(θ/2)) ) = cos(θ/2)

Second component: 2 sin (θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 cos(θ/2)) ) = sin(θ/2 )

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(θ/2); sin(θ/2) ]

Alternatively:

Wait, let me check that step again.

If I express the components:

"I am trying to find the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon, specifically looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The components of the operator P are defined as ħ/2 multiplied by the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z. Since the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, its y-component is zero, meaning we only need to consider P_x and P_z.

For a direction in the x-z plane, we can represent the direction vector n using spherical coordinates, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. The components of n are (sinθ, 0, cosθ). This means the operator P·n equals P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ, which expands to (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ).

Writing this as a matrix, we get:
(ħ/2)[ [0, 1; 1, 0] sinθ + [1, 0; 0, -1] cosθ ]

When we multiply out the terms:
σ_x sinθ gives [0, sinθ; sinθ, 0]
σ_z cosθ gives [cosθ, 0; 0, -cosθ]

Adding these together and multiplying by ħ/2, the complete matrix is:

Since eigenvectors are independent of scalar factors, we can write the eigenvalue equation as:
[cosθ, sinθ; sinθ, -cosθ] * v = (+1) * v

Let v be [a; b]. This gives us two equations:
1) cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2) sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Rearranging these:
(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0
sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

From these equations, we can find:
a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ - 1) = (cosθ + 1) / sinθ

This means the eigenvector is proportional to [(cosθ + 1), sinθ]. After normalization by 1/sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)), and using trigonometric identities where 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2) and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2), we can express the normalized eigenvector as:
[cos(θ/2); sin(θ/2)]"

Sure, here is the paraphrased text:

I need to determine the eigenvector of the muon spin operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, associated with the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components P_x, P_y, and P_z are expressed as ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z, respectively. However, since the direction is confined to the x-z plane, the y-component does not contribute here. By definition, vector n in this plane has no y-component. Thus, the operator along n combines P_x and P_z.

To begin, I'll represent the operator for a direction in the x-z plane. In spherical coordinates, in this plane, n would have an angle θ from the z-axis, equating to components (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Hence, the operator P·n becomes P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Since P_x and P_z are given by (ħ/2)σ_x and (ħ/2)σ_z, the operator P·n translates to (ħ/2)(σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ). Writing this in matrix form gives:

(ħ/2)([ [0, 1; 1, 0] sinθ + [1, 0; 0, -1] cosθ ])

Let's compute this. Distributing sinθ and cosθ yields:

First, σ_x sinθ:
[0, sinθ; sinθ, 0]

Second, σ_z cosθ:
[cosθ, 0; 0, -cosθ]

Add these to get the matrix:
[cosθ, sinθ; sinθ, -cosθ]

Scaling by ħ/2, the eigenvalue equation becomes:

[ [cosθ, sinθ; sinθ, -cosθ] ] * v = (+1) * v 

Given the matrix scales by (ħ/2), the eigenvalue equation remains above. With v as [a; b], we get:

[cosθ *a + sinθ *b] = a
[sinθ *a - cosθ *b] = b

So, two equations arise:

1) cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2) sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Reworking equation 1 gives:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ * b = 0

For equation 2:

sinθ * a - (cosθ + 1) * b = 0

Now forming a system of linear equations:

[ (cosθ - 1) sinθ ] [a] = [0]
[ sinθ -(cosθ + 1) ] [b] = [0]

A non-trivial solution requires the determinant of the matrix to be zero. However, knowing a solution exists from the eigenvalue equation, we solve the system.

From equation 1:

(cosθ - 1) a = - sinθ * b => a/b = - sinθ / (cosθ - 1)

From equation 2:

sinθ * a = (cosθ + 1) * b => a/b = (cosθ + 1) / sinθ

Equalize these:

- sinθ / (cosθ - 1) = (cosθ + 1) / sinθ

Cross-multiplying gives:

- (sinθ)^2 = (cosθ + 1)(cosθ - 1) = -sin²θ

Confirming an identity confirms consistency.

Now expressing a in terms of b via equation 2: a = [(cosθ + 1) / sinθ] * b

The eigenvector is proportional to [(cosθ + 1) / sinθ, 1], requiring normalization. Consider it as:

v = [(cosθ + 1), sinθ] transposed, with a constant N for normalization.

Avoiding denominators, write eigenvector as [ (cosθ + 1), sinθ] before normalizing.

The norm for v = [(cosθ + 1), sinθ] is computed as:

Square each component: (cosθ + 1)^2 + (sinθ)^2 = 1 + 2cosθ + 1 = 2 + 2cosθ

So the norm squared is 2(1 + cosθ)

Rewrite with trigonometric identities. Note 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2), sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2)

This results in:

Normalization factor N = 1 / (2 cos(θ/2))

A normalized vector becomes:

[ (cosθ + 1) / (2 cos(θ/2)), sinθ / (2 cos(θ/2)) ]

Alternatively expressed in terms of θ/2:

Using trigonometric identities yields:

First component: 2 cos²(θ/2) / (2 cos(θ/2)) = cos(θ/2)

Second component: 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / (2 cos(θ/2)) = sin(θ/2)

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[cos(θ/2); sin(θ/2)]

Hmm. Wait, standard spin-1/2 states... the eigenvectors for spin in direction (theta, 0) in spherical coordinates are usually written as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ] but since phi is zero here (since it\'s in x-z plane), so [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]. That matches.\n\nBut let me check for theta=0. If theta=0, direction is along +z. The eigenvectors would be [1;0], which is cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. That works. For theta = pi, direction is along -z: then [cos(pi/2); sin(pi/2)] = [0;1]. But wait, for theta=pi, the direction is along -z. The eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be the spin down state. Wait, but [0;1] is indeed the spin down state for σ_z? Let me check. σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So eigenvectors for +1 are [1;0], and -1 are [0;1]. But here theta=pi, direction is along -z, the operator would be P · n = -P_z, so with eigenvalue +ħ/2 would correspond to eigenvalue -1 for σ_z. Hmm, so maybe there is a possible discrepancy here.\n\nWait, if the direction is theta from the z-axis in the x-z plane, for theta=0 it\'s pointing along +z, then the eigenvalue +1 (for sigma_z) would correspond to eigenvector [1;0]. However, when theta=pi, direction is -z. Then the operator would be sin(theta) sigma_x + cos(theta) sigma_z = sin(pi) sigma_x + cos(pi) sigma_z = 0*sigma_x - sigma_z. So matrix is [[-1,0],[0,1]], so the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1 would be [0;1], as standard. So in our expression for theta=pi, the state would be [ cos(pi/2); sin(pi/2) ]= [0;1], which works. So that seems correct.\n\nHence the normalized eigenvectors are [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]. So elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).\n\nWait, so maybe that\'s the answer. But the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". It doesn\'t specify theta, so they might want the answer in terms of theta or in terms of general expressions? Wait, perhaps they want the components in terms of theta. However, the components must be written as two elements of the vector. Wait, given that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking to express the eigenvector in terms of the direction n. However, considering the standard result, the spin-1/2 eigenvector along a direction (theta, 0) is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], as we derived above.\n\nThus, the normalized eigenvector would have elements [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]\n\nBut given that the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, perhaps we can leave the answer in terms of theta, but the problem didn\'t state to leave it as symbolic, it just says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So likely it\'s referring to the components as expressions in theta.\n\nBut let me check my derivation:\n\nFrom start: given P_n = (P_x sin theta + P_z cos theta). The eigen equation leads to the normalized eigenstate [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].\n\nBut just now checking the case where direction is along x-axis, if theta is 90 degrees (pi/2). So theta=pi/2, the direction is along x-axis. The eigenvector should be [ cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4) ] which is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]. Let\'s check. If the operator sigma_x: [[0,1],[1,0]], then eigenvectors for +1 are [1;1]/sqrt(2), which matches, since cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So yes, that works.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ cos(theta/2) ]\n\n[ sin(theta/2) ]\n\nTherefore, the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). However, theta here is the polar angle from the z-axis. The problem says the direction n is in x-z plane. So that\'s theta.\n\nBut wait, wait, the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. But in standard notation, if we define θ as the angle from the z-axis towards the x-axis, then n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). That seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the normalized eigenvector has components:\n\ncos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), hence expressed as a column vector:\n\n[ cos(theta/2) ]\n\n[ sin(theta/2) ]\n\nBut theta is from the z-axis. Is there another way to write this? Well, sometimes people use the angle from the x-axis, but given the problem states the direction in the x-z plane, it\'s conventional to use θ from z-axis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a more compact form. Wait, actually maybe parametrized by the direction components. If n is in x-z plane, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). But how is theta defined here? It\'s the angle between n and the z-axis.\n\nAlternatively, if we let n be (a, 0, b), with a² + b² =1. Then the operator P_n is (a σ_x + b σ_z) ħ/2. The eigenvectors would still depend on a and b. Alternatively, write answer in terms of a and b. Wait, perhaps that\'s another option.\n\nBut since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Then theta is the angle between n and the z-axis, so a= sin theta, b= cos theta.\n\nTherefore, our eigenvector as a function of theta is [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ]\n\nAlternatively, in terms of n_x and n_z. Let\'s see:\n\nGiven that sin theta = n_x, cos theta = n_z.\n\nSo we can express the components as:\n\ncos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )\n\nsin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos theta)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )\n\nBut sin theta / 2 = Since theta is from the z-axis, sin(theta/2) can also be written in terms of n_x. Maybe?\n\nWait, sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ). Since sin theta = n_x, then n_x = 2 sin(theta/2 )cos(theta/2 )\n\nWhich gives sin(theta/2 ) = n_x / ( 2 cos(theta/2 ) )\n\nBut not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the answer can be written in terms of the components of n. Let me note that since n represents the direction. The original question just wants the elements of the eigenvector, normalized. So if theta is a variable, then as written [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]\n\nBut the problem statement is a bit ambiguous on whether they need an answer in terms of theta (angle) or components. Wait, the problem states:\n\n"Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2."\n\nSo "along an arbitrary direction n". But in the procedure, we have parameterized the direction n in terms of theta from the z-axis. Maybe in the problem\'s perspective, theta is the polar angle in x-z plane, so maybe expecting answer in terms of theta.\n\nAlternatively, if n is general, with n_x and n_z, then maybe in terms of n_x and n_z. Given that n is a unit vector. So let\'s attempt.\n\nLet me consider the components. Since n is in x-z plane, with n_y =0. So n_x= sinθ, n_z= cosθ. Then, the operator in direction n is:\n\nsigma_n = sigma_x n_x + sigma_z n_z = [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]\n\nThen the eigenvalue equation (sigma_n ) v = v where eigenvalue is +1 (since (ħ/2)*sigma_n acting on v gives (ħ/2) *1* v )\n\nTherefore, solving:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]\n\nWhich gives equations:\n\nn_z a +n_x b = a ...(1)\n\nn_x a -n_z b = b ...(2)\n\nEquation 1: n_z a - a + n_x b =0 => (n_z -1)a + n_x b=0.\n\nEquation 2: n_x a - (n_z +1)b=0.\n\nSame as earlier. The solution should lead to the same ratios. From equation (2) n_x a = (n_z +1 ) b => a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):\n\n(n_z -1 ) [ (n_z +1 ) /n_x ] b + n_x b = 0\n\nFactor out b:\n\n[ (n_z -1)(n_z +1 ) /n_x + n_x ] b=0\n\nMultiply through by n_x:\n\n[ (n_z^2 -1 ) +n_x^2 ] b=0\n\nBut n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1 (unit vector), so (1 -1 )=0.\n\nThus, 0 * b=0 is satisfied. Thus, the equations are consistent. Then, similar to before, express a in terms of b. From equation (2):\n\na = (n_z +1 )/(n_x ) b. But then, use normalization.\n\nSo components are a and b with a = (n_z +1 )/n_x b. Let’s write eigenvector as [ (n_z +1 ) , n_x ]^T * N, where N is normalization factor.\n\nSimilarly as before, though spelling it out. Then the components are:\n\na = (n_z +1 )* N\n\nb = n_x * N\n\nThe normalization is:\n\n|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |N|^2 [ (n_z +1)^2 + n_x^2 ] =1\n\nExpanding (n_z +1 )^2 + n_x^2 = n_z^2 + 2n_z +1 +n_x^2.\n\nBut n_x^2 +n_z^2=1, so it becomes 1 + 2n_z +1= 2(1 +n_z )\n\nThus, |N|^2 * 2(1 +n_z ) =1 => |N|=1/sqrt( 2(1 +n_z ) )\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ (n_z +1 ) /sqrt(2(1 +n_z )) ; n_x /sqrt(2(1 +n_z )) ]\n\nAgain, express 1 + n_z in terms of angle theta. For example, 1 +n_z is 1 + cos theta. Then, sqrt(2(1+n_z )) = sqrt(2(1 + cos theta )) = 2 cos(theta/2 )\n\nSimilarly, n_x = sin theta.\n\nThen:\n\n(n_z +1 ) /sqrt(2(1+n_z )) = (2 cos^2(theta/2 ))/ (sqrt(4 cos^2(theta/2 )) )\n\n= (2 cos^2(theta/2 )) / (2 cos(theta/2 ))= cos(theta/2 )\n\nSimilarly, n_x /sqrt(2(1 +n_z )) = sin theta / (2 cos(theta/2 )) = (2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )) / (2 cos(theta/2 )) ) = sin(theta/2 )\n\nSo this brings us back to the same result: the normalized eigenvector components are [ cos(theta/2 ); sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nAlternatively, in terms of n_z and n_x:\n\nExpressed in terms of n_z, since n_z=cos theta:\n\ncos(theta/2 )=sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ) or plus or minus as square roots. Similarly for sin(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )\n\nBut here, since theta is between 0 and pi, these would be positive. So sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ) = cos(theta/2 )\n\nThus, another expression is:\n\nsqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )\n\nBut since sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )= sin(theta/2 ), as earlier.\n\nAlternatively, but perhaps not simplifying further.\n\nWait, since we can have n_x = sin theta, and n_z= cos theta. So cos(theta/2 )=sqrt( (1 + cos theta ) /2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 )\n\nSimilarly, sin(theta/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )\n\nHowever, from this, perhaps the eigenvectors can be expressed as:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 ) ]\n\nBut considering that in x-z plane, n_x =sqrt(1 -n_z^2 )\n\nBut maybe sqrt((1 +n_z )/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 )\n\nBut which one?\n\nAlternatively, use n_x = sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 ), so sqrt((1 -n_z )/2 ) = sin(theta/2 )\n\nSimilarly sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 )= cos(theta/2 )\n\nSo combine all together.\n\nThe eigenvector is:\n\n[ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nAlternatively:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 ) ]\n\nBut perhaps the latter is better if we need to write in terms of n_z and n_x. But with the caveats you need to take square roots, which might introduce sign issues, but since the eigenvalue is +1, we\'re talking about the positive component.\n\nWait, but if theta is measured from z-axis, then in conventional spherical coordinates, the spin coherent state is indeed [ cos(theta/2 ), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2 ) ] but here phi=0. So confirms our result.\n\nHowever, in this problem, maybe there\'s one more step. If, as the problem says, the direction is along arbitrary n in x-z plane, and wants the eigenvector elements. However, perhaps the problem wanted the answer in a more explicit matrix form regardless of theta. Wait, but theta is arbitrary. Wait, maybe if x-z plane, the problem wants an answer parametrized by an angle or other variables. \n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the problem states the general case and they need an answer in terms of the components in n direction. Hmm, but given that in x-z plane, without further parameters, theta is incorporated. Therefore, since theta is arbitrary, the components would be cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 ). Thus, expressed in terms of theta. But perhaps in the problem, the answer is expecting the eigenvector for angular momentum in direction n, so yes: as such. The answer will have cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )\n\nTherefore, maybe the box answer is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] or column vector.\n\nHence the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 )\n\nThus, normalized eigenvector elements are [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe elements of the normalized eigenvector are \\boxed{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)} and \\boxed{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1741155681, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4258, prompt_tokens=1905, total_tokens=6163, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To calculate the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by recognizing that the operator \(\vec{P}\) along direction \(\vec{n}\) is a combination of the Pauli matrices. 

Given the direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane, parameterized by an angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis, the components of \(\vec{n}\) are \((\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\). The operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) is expressed as:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta \right)
\]
where \(\sigma_x\) and \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the matrices, we get:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we solve the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:
1. \((\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0\)
2. \(\sin\theta a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0\)

Solving these equations, we find that the eigenvector can be expressed as proportional to \(\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta + 1 \\ \sin\theta \end{pmatrix}\). Normalizing this vector, we use the trigonometric identities \(1 + \cos\theta = 2\cos^2(\theta/2)\) and \(\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)\). The normalized eigenvector is found to be:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:
\[
\boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}
\]

 cosθ ) / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ )) = (1 + cosθ ) / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ )) ) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ ) / 2 ) ) = cos(θ/2 )

Similarly, the second component:

sinθ / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ )) = [2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2) ] / sqrt(2 * 2 cos²(θ/2 ))) )

Wait, sqrt(2*(1 + cosθ )) = sqrt(2*2 cos²(theta/2)) ) = sqrt(4 cos²(theta/2)) ) = 2 cos(theta/2 )

So sin theta / sqrt(2*(1 + cos theta )) = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [2 cos(theta/2) ] = sin(theta/2 )

Therefore, indeed the components reduce to [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ]

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ]

However, wait the original operator is along direction n which is in the x-z plane at an angle theta from the z-axis. Hmm. Wait, standard spin-1/2 states... the eigenvectors for spin in direction (theta, 0) in spherical coordinates are usually written as [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ] but since phi is zero here (since it's in x-z plane), so [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]. That matches.

But let me check for theta=0. If theta=0, direction is along +z. The eigenvectors would be [1;0], which is cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. That works. For theta = pi, direction is along -z: then [cos(pi/2); sin(pi/2)] = [0;1]. But wait, for theta=pi, the direction is along -z. The eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2 would be the spin down state. Wait, but [0;1] is indeed the spin down state for σ_z? Let me check. σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So eigenvectors for +1 are [1;0], and -1 are [0;1]. But here theta=pi, direction is along -z, the operator would be P · n = -P_z, so with eigenvalue +ħ/2 would correspond to eigenvalue -1 for σ_z. Hmm, so maybe there is a possible discrepancy here.

Wait, if the direction is theta from the z-axis in the x-z plane, for theta=0 it's pointing along +z, then the eigenvalue +1 (for sigma_z) would correspond to eigenvector [1;0]. However, when theta=pi, direction is -z. Then the operator would be sin(theta) sigma_x + cos(theta) sigma_z = sin(pi) sigma_x + cos(pi) sigma_z = 0*sigma_x - sigma_z. So matrix is [[-1,0],[0,1]], so the eigenvector with eigenvalue +1 would be [0;1], as standard. So in our expression for theta=pi, the state would be [ cos(pi/2); sin(pi/2) ]= [0;1], which works. So that seems correct.

Hence the normalized eigenvectors are [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)]. So elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait, so maybe that's the answer. But the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". It doesn't specify theta, so they might want the answer in terms of theta or in terms of general expressions? Wait, perhaps they want the components in terms of theta. However, the components must be written as two elements of the vector. Wait, given that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking to express the eigenvector in terms of the direction n. However, considering the standard result, the spin-1/2 eigenvector along a direction (theta, 0) is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], as we derived above.

Thus, the normalized eigenvector would have elements [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But given that the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, perhaps we can leave the answer in terms of theta, but the problem didn't state to leave it as symbolic, it just says "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So likely it's referring to the components as expressions in theta.

But let me check my derivation:

From start: given P_n = (P_x sin theta + P_z cos theta). The eigen equation leads to the normalized eigenstate [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But just now checking the case where direction is along x-axis, if theta is 90 degrees (pi/2). So theta=pi/2, the direction is along x-axis. The eigenvector should be [ cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4) ] which is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2]. Let's check. If the operator sigma_x: [[0,1],[1,0]], then eigenvectors for +1 are [1;1]/sqrt(2), which matches, since cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So yes, that works.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2) ]

[ sin(theta/2) ]

Therefore, the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). However, theta here is the polar angle from the z-axis. The problem says the direction n is in x-z plane. So that's theta.

But wait, wait, the problem says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So n is a unit vector in the x-z plane. But in standard notation, if we define θ as the angle from the z-axis towards the x-axis, then n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). That seems consistent.

Therefore, the answer is that the normalized eigenvector has components:

cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), hence expressed as a column vector:

[ cos(theta/2) ]

[ sin(theta/2) ]

But theta is from the z-axis. Is there another way to write this? Well, sometimes people use the angle from the x-axis, but given the problem states the direction in the x-z plane, it's conventional to use θ from z-axis.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a more compact form. Wait, actually maybe parametrized by the direction components. If n is in x-z plane, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ). But how is theta defined here? It's the angle between n and the z-axis.

Alternatively, if we let n be (a, 0, b), with a² + b² =1. Then the operator P_n is (a σ_x + b σ_z) ħ/2. The eigenvectors would still depend on a and b. Alternatively, write answer in terms of a and b. Wait, perhaps that's another option.

But since n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Then theta is the angle between n and the z-axis, so a= sin theta, b= cos theta.

Therefore, our eigenvector as a function of theta is [ cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2) ]

Alternatively, in terms of n_x and n_z. Let's see:

Given that sin theta = n_x, cos theta = n_z.

So we can express the components as:

cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

sin(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 - cos theta)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

But sin theta / 2 = Since theta is from the z-axis, sin(theta/2) can also be written in terms of n_x. Maybe?

Wait, sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ). Since sin theta = n_x, then n_x = 2 sin(theta/2 )cos(theta/2 )

Which gives sin(theta/2 ) = n_x / ( 2 cos(theta/2 ) )

But not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the answer can be written in terms of the components of n. Let me note that since n represents the direction. The original question just wants the elements of the eigenvector, normalized. So if theta is a variable, then as written [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous on whether they need an answer in terms of theta (angle) or components. Wait, the problem states:

"Calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2."

So "along an arbitrary direction n". But in the procedure, we have parameterized the direction n in terms of theta from the z-axis. Maybe in the problem's perspective, theta is the polar angle in x-z plane, so maybe expecting answer in terms of theta.

Alternatively, if n is general, with n_x and n_z, then maybe in terms of n_x and n_z. Given that n is a unit vector. So let's attempt.

Let me consider the components. Since n is in x-z plane, with n_y =0. So n_x= sinθ, n_z= cosθ. Then, the operator in direction n is:

sigma_n = sigma_x n_x + sigma_z n_z = [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Then the eigenvalue equation (sigma_n ) v = v where eigenvalue is +1 (since (ħ/2)*sigma_n acting on v gives (ħ/2) *1* v )

Therefore, solving:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives equations:

n_z a +n_x b = a ...(1)

n_x a -n_z b = b ...(2)

Equation 1: n_z a - a + n_x b =0 => (n_z -1)a + n_x b=0.

Equation 2: n_x a - (n_z +1)b=0.

Same as earlier. The solution should lead to the same ratios. From equation (2) n_x a = (n_z +1 ) b => a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b.

Substitute into equation (1):

(n_z -1 ) [ (n_z +1 ) /n_x ] b + n_x b = 0

Factor out b:

[ (n_z -1)(n_z +1 ) /n_x + n_x ] b=0

Multiply through by n_x:

[ (n_z^2 -1 ) +n_x^2 ] b=0

But n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1 (unit vector), so (1 -1 )=0.

Thus, 0 * b=0 is satisfied. Thus, the equations are consistent. Then, similar to before, express a in terms of b. From equation (2):

a = (n_z +1 )/(n_x ) b. But then, use normalization.

So components are a and b with a = (n_z +1 )/n_x b. Let’s write eigenvector as [ (n_z +1 ) , n_x ]^T * N, where N is normalization factor.

Similarly as before, though spelling it out. Then the components are:

a = (n_z +1 )* N

b = n_x * N

The normalization is:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |N|^2 [ (n_z +1)^2 + n_x^2 ] =1

Expanding (n_z +1 )^2 + n_x^2 = n_z^2 + 2n_z +1 +n_x^2.

But n_x^2 +n_z^2=1, so it becomes 1 + 2n_z +1= 2(1 +n_z )

Thus, |N|^2 * 2(1 +n_z ) =1 => |N|=1/sqrt( 2(1 +n_z ) )

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (n_z +1 ) /sqrt(2(1 +n_z )) ; n_x /sqrt(2(1 +n_z )) ]

Again, express 1 + n_z in terms of angle theta. For example, 1 +n_z is 1 + cos theta. Then, sqrt(2(1+n_z )) = sqrt(2(1 + cos theta )) = 2 cos(theta/2 )

Similarly, n_x = sin theta.

Then:

(n_z +1 ) /sqrt(2(1+n_z )) = (2 cos^2(theta/2 ))/ (sqrt(4 cos^2(theta/2 )) )

= (2 cos^2(theta/2 )) / (2 cos(theta/2 ))= cos(theta/2 )

Similarly, n_x /sqrt(2(1 +n_z )) = sin theta / (2 cos(theta/2 )) = (2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )) / (2 cos(theta/2 )) ) = sin(theta/2 )

So this brings us back to the same result: the normalized eigenvector components are [ cos(theta/2 ); sin(theta/2 ) ]

Alternatively, in terms of n_z and n_x:

Expressed in terms of n_z, since n_z=cos theta:

cos(theta/2 )=sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ) or plus or minus as square roots. Similarly for sin(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )

But here, since theta is between 0 and pi, these would be positive. So sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

Thus, another expression is:

sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )

But since sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )= sin(theta/2 ), as earlier.

Alternatively, but perhaps not simplifying further.

Wait, since we can have n_x = sin theta, and n_z= cos theta. So cos(theta/2 )=sqrt( (1 + cos theta ) /2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 )

Similarly, sin(theta/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )

However, from this, perhaps the eigenvectors can be expressed as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 ) ]

But considering that in x-z plane, n_x =sqrt(1 -n_z^2 )

But maybe sqrt((1 +n_z )/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 )

But which one?

Alternatively, use n_x = sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 ), so sqrt((1 -n_z )/2 ) = sin(theta/2 )

Similarly sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 )= cos(theta/2 )

So combine all together.

The eigenvector is:

[ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Alternatively:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 ) ]

But perhaps the latter is better if we need to write in terms of n_z and n_x. But with the caveats you need to take square roots, which might introduce sign issues, but since the eigenvalue is +1, we're talking about the positive component.

Wait, but if theta is measured from z-axis, then in conventional spherical coordinates, the spin coherent state is indeed [ cos(theta/2 ), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2 ) ] but here phi=0. So confirms our result.

However, in this problem, maybe there's one more step. If, as the problem says, the direction is along arbitrary n in x-z plane, and wants the eigenvector elements. However, perhaps the problem wanted the answer in a more explicit matrix form regardless of theta. Wait, but theta is arbitrary. Wait, maybe if x-z plane, the problem wants an answer parametrized by an angle or other variables. 

Wait, alternatively, maybe the problem states the general case and they need an answer in terms of the components in n direction. Hmm, but given that in x-z plane, without further parameters, theta is incorporated. Therefore, since theta is arbitrary, the components would be cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 ). Thus, expressed in terms of theta. But perhaps in the problem, the answer is expecting the eigenvector for angular momentum in direction n, so yes: as such. The answer will have cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )

Therefore, maybe the box answer is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] or column vector.

Hence the elements of the normalized eigenvector are cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 )

Thus, normalized eigenvector elements are [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

**Final Answer**
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} and \boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To find the normalized eigenvector of the spin operator \( \vec{P} \) along direction \( \vec{n} \) in the x-z plane for eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \), follow these steps:

1. **Express the Operator \( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \):**
   - For \( \vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta) \), the operator is:
     \[
     \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta \right)
     \]
   - Matrix form:
     \[
     \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \rightarrow \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
     \]

2. **Set Up Eigenvalue Equation:**
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   This leads to:
   - \( \cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = a \)
   - \( \sin\theta \cdot a - \cos\theta \cdot b = b \)

3. **Solve for Eigenvector Components:**
   - From the first equation: \( (\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \cdot b = 0 \)
   - From the second equation: \( \sin\theta \cdot a - (\cos\theta + 1) \cdot b = 0 \)
   - Ratios give \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{1 + \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \)

4. **Normalize the Eigenvector:**
   - Choose \( a = \cos(\theta/2) \) and \( b = \sin(\theta/2) \), normalized as \( \cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1 \).

**Normalized Eigenvector:**
\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}}
\]

To confirm, I need to check when θ = 0, the eigenvector is [1;0], which matches. When θ = π/2, it's [sqrt(2)/2; sqrt(2)/2], as expected.[1]

To find the normalized eigenvector of the operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\):

1. **Operator Construction**: The direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane is parameterized by an angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis: \(\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)\). The operator becomes:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sigma_x \sin\theta + \sigma_z \cos\theta \right)
   \]
   Substituting the Pauli matrices:
   \[
   \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**: For eigenvector \(|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}\) with eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\):
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
   \]

3. **Solving the System**:
   - From the equations \(\cos\theta a + \sin\theta b = a\) and \(\sin\theta a - \cos\theta b = b\), express \(a\) in terms of \(b\):
   \[
   a = \frac{\cos\theta + 1}{\sin\theta} b
   \]

4. **Normalization**:
   - The eigenvector is proportional to \(\begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta + 1 \\ \sin\theta \end{pmatrix}\). Use trigonometric identities \(1 + \cos\theta = 2\cos^2(\theta/2)\) and \(\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)\) for normalization:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(1 + \cos\theta)}} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta + 1 \\ \sin\theta \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix}
   \]

**Final Answer**:
The normalized eigenvector elements are \(\boxed{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}\) and \(\boxed{\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}\).
