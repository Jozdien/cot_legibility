To find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions with the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

First, we rewrite the potential using the identity \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2} \):
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \left( \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2} \right)
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{4} kr^2 + \frac{3}{4} kr^2 \cos(2\theta)
\]
\[
= \frac{5}{4} kr^2 + \frac{3}{4} kr^2 \cos(2\theta)
\]

Using \( \cos(2\theta) = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} \), we convert this to Cartesian coordinates:
\[
V(x, y) = \frac{5}{4} k (x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{4} k (x^2 - y^2)
\]
\[
= \frac{5}{4} k x^2 + \frac{5}{4} k y^2 + \frac{3}{4} k x^2 - \frac{3}{4} k y^2
\]
\[
= 2k x^2 + \frac{1}{2} k y^2
\]

This potential is separable into two harmonic oscillators in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions with different spring constants. The Hamiltonian for each direction is:
\[
H_x = \frac{p_x^2}{2m} + 2k x^2, \quad H_y = \frac{p_y^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}k y^2
\]

The frequencies of these oscillators are:
\[
\omega_x = 2 \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

The energy levels for a harmonic oscillator in each direction are \( E_x = \hbar \omega_x (n_x + \frac{1}{2}) \) and \( E_y = \hbar \omega_y (n_y + \frac{1}{2}) \). Summing these energies gives:
\[
E(n_x, n_y) = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Substituting the frequencies \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \):
\[
E(n_x, n_y) = \hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):
\[
E(n_x, n_y) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2 \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right)
\]
\[
= \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + 1 + n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]
\[
= \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)
\]

### Final Answer
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

Okay, so I need to find the energy spectrum for a quantum particle moving in two dimensions with the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the particle is in two dimensions, so we're dealing with polar coordinates (r, θ). The potential has two terms: one that depends only on r, which is (1/2)kr², and another term that depends on both r and θ, which is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, so the entire potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ). Let me check if that simplifies or can be expressed in a different form.

Let me factor out the common terms. The first term is (1/2 k r²) and the second term is (3/2 k r² cos²θ). If I factor out (1/2 k r²), I get:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)[1 + 3 cos²θ]

Hmm, or maybe (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ). I wonder if there's a way to rewrite cos²θ in terms of something that can help separate variables. Because in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials in polar coordinates, separating variables can be helpful. So, maybe this potential allows separation of radial and angular parts?

Let me think, we can use the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let's apply that:

1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ.

So then V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)*(5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ). Hmm, not sure if this helps. Wait, so perhaps the potential can be split into a radial term and an angular term, but here, both terms have r² multiplied by angular functions. That complicates things because the potential is not separable into purely radial and purely angular parts. Because if it were separable, we could write V(r, θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(θ), but here it's V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) [1 + 3 cos²θ], which is V(r, θ) = f(r)g(θ). That actually is multiplicatively separable, but in the Schrödinger equation, you need additive separation. Maybe that complicates things.

Wait, multiplicative separation. Hmm, so the equation is:

[-ħ²/(2m) (∇²)] ψ + V(r, θ) ψ = E ψ

If V is multiplicative in r and θ, can we separate variables? I thought separation of variables works when the potential is additive. Let me recall. In cartesian coordinates, if V(x,y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), you can separate variables. In polar coordinates, if potential is a sum of radial and angular parts, maybe. But here the potential is of the form V(r, θ) = f(r)g(θ), it's a product, not a sum.

Hmm. Is there a way to make it additive?

Alternatively, maybe I can use some approximation or coordinate transformation. Let's think.

Alternatively, express the potential as V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) [1 + 3 cos²θ], which can also be represented as (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Perhaps this reminds me of some standard potential. Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ is related to the Legendre polynomial? P_2(cosθ) = (3 cos²θ - 1)/2. So, if I manipulate that.

If we consider P_2(cosθ) = (3 cos²θ -1)/2, then 3 cos²θ = 2 P_2 + 1, so substituting that into our expression:

1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + (2 P_2 + 1) = 2 P_2 + 2 = 2(P_2 + 1). Wait, perhaps not too helpful. However, this shows that the angular dependence can be written in terms of a spherical harmonic, but this is 2D, so in polar coordinates, it's related to Fourier series maybe?

Alternatively, since in 2D polar coordinates, the angular dependence is typically expressed in terms of e^{imθ} for m integer. But here, we have a potential with angular dependence cos²θ. Let's expand cos²θ using a Fourier series. Wait, in 2D polar coordinates, the angular solutions are e^{imθ} where m is an integer. So given that our potential has a cos²θ term, which can be written as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Therefore, V(r, θ) can be written as (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr²*(1 + cos2θ)/2) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ) = (1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4 kr² cos2θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ).

Therefore, written as V(r, θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ). Hmm, so there's an isotropic harmonic oscillator term (5/4 kr²) and another term that couples r² and angular dependence through cos2θ.

So the total potential is part isotropic oscillator and part angular-dependent term. This suggests that the Schrödinger equation is not separable in polar coordinates. Therefore, perhaps another coordinate system is more suitable?

Wait, if I make a coordinate transformation? For example, parabolic coordinates, but I don't remember if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, given that the angular term is proportional to cos2θ, maybe express the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates?

Because cos2θ = (x² - y²)/r². Since cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r², sin²θ = y²/r², so cos2θ = cos²θ - sin²θ = (x² - y²)/r². Therefore, the potential can be written as:

V(r, θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4) k r²*(x² - y²)/r²) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k (x² - y²).

Wait, but x² + y² = r², so r² = x² + y². Then substituting this, we have V(x, y) = (5/4)k(x² + y²) + (3/4)k(x² - y²).

Simplify the terms:

= [5/4 k x² + 5/4 k y²] + [3/4 k x² - 3/4k y²]

Combine like terms:

= (5/4 + 3/4)k x² + (5/4 - 3/4)k y²

= (8/4)k x² + (2/4)k y²

= 2k x² + (1/2)k y²

Oh! So the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's actually separable, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, it's just a sum of harmonic potentials in x and y directions with different spring constants. 2k x² and (1/2)k y². So, the potential is V(x, y) = (2k)x² + (1/2)k y².

So the Hamiltonian is H = H_x + H_y, where H_x = p_x²/(2m) + 2k x² and H_y = p_y²/(2m) + (1/2)k y². Therefore, because the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, we can solve each direction separately.

So each direction is a harmonic oscillator. In the x-direction, the spring constant is 2k, which has frequency ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), and in the y-direction, the spring constant is (1/2)k, so frequency ω_y = sqrt( (1/2)k / m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)).

So the energy levels would be the sum of the energies from each direction: E = E_x + E_y = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2), where n_x, n_y are non-negative integers.

Let me confirm that. Since for a harmonic oscillator in 1D, the energy levels are (n + 1/2) ħ ω. Therefore, applying that to each direction:

E(n_x, n_y) = (n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/(2m))

But the problem is two-dimensional, right? So in Cartesian coordinates, the solution is separable, so the total energy is the sum of the energies in x and y. Therefore, after converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates, if we separate variables correctly, we can write the energy spectrum as such.

Wait, but actually I converted the original given potential V(r, θ) into Cartesian coordinates and found V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Let's recheck this to avoid errors.

Original potential: V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ)

In Cartesian, r² = x² + y², cosθ = x/r, so r² cos²θ = x². Therefore:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 k)(x² + y²) + (3/2 k)(x²) = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²) = (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + 1/2 k y² = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Yes, confirmed. So V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2 k) y².

Therefore, yes, this is a 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator, with different spring constants in x and y. Therefore, the energy spectrum is simply the sum of the 1D harmonic oscillators in each direction.

Therefore, H = H_x + H_y, each being harmonic oscillators. Therefore,

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2)

So now I need to compute ω_x and ω_y from the spring constants.

Hooke's law potential V(x) = (1/2) m ω_x² x², so solving for ω_x:

For x-direction: V_x = 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x². Therefore:

(1/2) m ω_x² = 2k => ω_x² = 4k/m => ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly in y-direction: V_y = (1/2)k y² = (1/2)m ω_y² y², therefore:

(1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k => ω_y² = k/m => ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Therefore, ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), ω_y = sqrt(k/m). Therefore, substituting back:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ [2 sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2)].

Factor out sqrt(k/m):

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]

Simplify the terms inside the brackets:

= 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2

= 2n_x + n_y + 3/2

Hence,

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But wait, express ħ sqrt(k/m). Let's note that sqrt(k/m) is the natural frequency of the standard harmonic oscillator. If we define ω = sqrt(k/m), then ħ ω.

But wait, just checking: The standard HO has V = (1/2)m ω² x², so indeed, if the potental here for the x-direction is 2k x² implies that ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m); as above.

Wait, if I use k' for the spring constant, but here in our problem statement, k is already given. In standard HO, V = (1/2)k x², so here, for x-direction, the coefficient is 2k. Hence,  V_x = 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x², so (1/2)m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = 4k/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). Yup, that's consistent. So basically, all components check out.

Therefore, the energy levels are:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ √(k/m) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

Alternatively, factor the 2:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ √(k/m) [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) + 1/2]?

Wait, perhaps not necessary. Wait, let's compute:

Original expression after factoring:

= ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Indeed.

Alternatively, to make the expression in terms of the usual quantum numbers. Not sure if this can be expressed in terms of another quantum number, but it's already separated. So the energy depends on the combination 2n_x + n_y. For example, you can write E = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Hence, the energy levels are quantized with quantum numbers n_x and n_y = 0,1,2,... So the energy spectrum is E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ), where ω = √(k/m). But hold on, isn't ω usually sqrt(k/m). For standard HO, yes. But in our x-direction, the effective ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), which can be expressed as 2ω, if we let ω = sqrt(k/m)

If that’s the case, for ease, let's set ω = sqrt(k/m). Then ω_x = 2ω and ω_y = ω. So:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ (2ω)(n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω (n_y + 1/2 ) = ħ ω [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] = ħ ω [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ].

Alternatively, expressing in terms of the standard ω.

So the energy spectrum is:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ ω ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

where ω = sqrt(k/m), and n_x, n_y = 0,1,2,...

Alternatively, maybe to write it in terms of some different variable. Hmm, but I think this might already be acceptable. Let me check the steps again.

- Convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates, realizing that cos2θ is proportional to (x² - y²)/r². That allows for rewriting the potential such that it's separable in x and y directions, revealing the anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Then, since each direction has a different frequency, sum their energies. The key insight was that even though the potential looks tricky in polar coordinates, expressing it in Cartesian makes it separable.

Alternatively, just to ensure, suppose I didn’t realize that, and tried to work in polar coordinates. Would we be able to separate variables? Let's think. The potential in polar coordinates in this case includes both r² and angular terms. The radial part and the angular part are multiplied by one another. Let see.

The Hamiltonian in polar coordinates would be:

H = - (ħ²/(2m))( ∂²/∂r² + (1/r)∂/∂r + (1/r²)∂²/∂θ² ) + V(r, θ)

Given V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

Trying to separate variables by writing ψ(r, θ) = R(r)Φ(θ). Then:

1/R [ - (ħ²/(2m))( ∂²R/∂r² + (1/r)∂R/∂r ) + (1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ) R ] + 1/Φ [ - (ħ²/(2m))( 1/r² ∂²Φ/∂θ² ) ] = E

But this equation must hold for all r and θ, so if the potential is not additive, but multiplicative, we can't separate variables easily. Unless we can manipulate the angular terms to be constants.

But in this problem, converting to Cartesian coordinates made the potential separable, leading us to the simple solution, which is likely the way to go. Therefore, once in Cartesian coordinates and split into x and y with separate harmonic oscillator potentials, we can easily write down the energy levels as sum of each direction.

Alternatively, let me verify: Suppose we have V(x, y) = (1/2)m ω_x² x² + (1/2)m ω_y² y². Then, the energy would actually be (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y). In our case, for the x-direction, we have V_x = 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x², so (as before) ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). For the y-direction, V_y = (1/2)k y² = (1/2)m ω_y² y², so ω_y = sqrt(k/m). That matches.

Therefore, the energy spectrum is indeed E(n_x, n_y) = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x + (n_y +1/2) ħ ω_y.

Simplify that in terms of k and m:

Substitute ω_x = 2√(k/m), ω_y = √(k/m)

Thus,

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ (2√(k/m))(n_x + 1/2) + ħ √(k/m)(n_y + 1/2 )

Factor out ħ √(k/m):

= ħ √(k/m)[2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)]

= ħ √(k/m)[2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2]

= ħ √(k/m)[2n_x + n_y + 3/2]

So the energy spectrum is E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ √(k/m) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ) where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...).

Therefore, that's our conclusion. So the key steps were:

1. Realize that converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates allows separation of variables, leading to an anisotropic harmonic oscillator.

2. Find the effective frequencies in x and y directions.

3. Sum the individual energy contributions from each direction.

Therefore, the answer is this expression for the energy levels. I should check if there is any further simplification or a standard form. I can perhaps express the spectrum in terms of a single quantum number or consider combinations of n_x and n_y, but since the oscillator is anisotropic, it's typical that the energy depends on both n_x and n_y. So likely, expressing E in terms of n_x and n_y is correct.

Alternatively, the problem might have some hidden symmetry, but given the different coefficients in front of the x and y terms, it's just an anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Hence, the energy levels are as above.

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

Okay, so I need to find the energy spectrum for a quantum particle moving in two dimensions with the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the particle is in two dimensions, so we're dealing with polar coordinates (r, θ). The potential has two terms: one that depends only on r, which is (1/2)kr², and another term that depends on both r and θ, which is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, so the entire potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ). Let me check if that simplifies or can be expressed in a different form.

Let me factor out the common terms. The first term is (1/2 k r²) and the second term is (3/2 k r² cos²θ). If I factor out (1/2 k r²), I get:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)[1 + 3 cos²θ]

Hmm, or maybe (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ). I wonder if there's a way to rewrite cos²θ in terms of something that can help separate variables. Because in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials in polar coordinates, separating variables can be helpful. So, maybe this potential allows separation of radial and angular parts?

Let me think, we can use the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let's apply that:

1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2)cos2θ = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ.

So then V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)*(5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ). Hmm, not sure if this helps. Wait, so perhaps the potential can be split into a radial term and an angular term, but here, both terms have r² multiplied by angular functions. That complicates things because the potential is not separable into purely radial and purely angular parts. Because if it were separable, we could write V(r, θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(θ), but here it's V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) [1 + 3 cos²θ], which is V(r, θ) = f(r)g(θ). That actually is multiplicatively separable, but in the Schrödinger equation, you need additive separation. Maybe that complicates things.

Wait, multiplicative separation. Hmm, so the equation is:

[-ħ²/(2m) (∇²)] ψ + V(r, θ) ψ = E ψ

If V is multiplicative in r and θ, can we separate variables? I thought separation of variables works when the potential is additive. Let me recall. In cartesian coordinates, if V(x,y) = V_x(x) + V_y(y), you can separate variables. In polar coordinates, if potential is a sum of radial and angular parts, maybe. But here the potential is of the form V(r, θ) = f(r)g(θ), it's a product, not a sum.

Hmm. Is there a way to make it additive?

Alternatively, maybe I can use some approximation or coordinate transformation. Let's think.

Alternatively, express the potential as V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) [1 + 3 cos²θ], which can also be represented as (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Perhaps this reminds me of some standard potential. Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ is related to the Legendre polynomial? P_2(cosθ) = (3 cos²θ - 1)/2. So, if I manipulate that.

If we consider P_2(cosθ) = (3 cos²θ -1)/2, then 3 cos²θ = 2 P_2 + 1, so substituting that into our expression:

1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + (2 P_2 + 1) = 2 P_2 + 2 = 2(P_2 + 1). Wait, perhaps not too helpful. However, this shows that the angular dependence can be written in terms of a spherical harmonic, but this is 2D, so in polar coordinates, it's related to Fourier series maybe?

Alternatively, since in 2D polar coordinates, the angular dependence is typically expressed in terms of e^{imθ} for m integer. But here, we have a potential with angular dependence cos²θ. Let's expand cos²θ using a Fourier series. Wait, in 2D polar coordinates, the angular solutions are e^{imθ} where m is an integer. So given that our potential has a cos²θ term, which can be written as (1 + cos2θ)/2. Therefore, V(r, θ) can be written as (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr²*(1 + cos2θ)/2) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ) = (1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4 kr² cos2θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ).

Therefore, written as V(r, θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ). Hmm, so there's an isotropic harmonic oscillator term (5/4 kr²) and another term that couples r² and angular dependence through cos2θ.

So the total potential is part isotropic oscillator and part angular-dependent term. This suggests that the Schrödinger equation is not separable in polar coordinates. Therefore, perhaps another coordinate system is more suitable?

Wait, if I make a coordinate transformation? For example, parabolic coordinates, but I don't remember if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, given that the angular term is proportional to cos2θ, maybe express the potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates?

Because cos2θ = (x² - y²)/r². Since cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/r², sin²θ = y²/r², so cos2θ = cos²θ - sin²θ = (x² - y²)/r². Therefore, the potential can be written as:

V(r, θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4) k r²*(x² - y²)/r²) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k (x² - y²).

Wait, but x² + y² = r², so r² = x² + y². Then substituting this, we have V(x, y) = (5/4)k(x² + y²) + (3/4)k(x² - y²).

Simplify the terms:

= [5/4 k x² + 5/4 k y²] + [3/4 k x² - 3/4k y²]

Combine like terms:

= (5/4 + 3/4)k x² + (5/4 - 3/4)k y²

= (8/4)k x² + (2/4)k y²

= 2k x² + (1/2)k y²

Oh! So the potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that's actually separable, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, it's just a sum of harmonic potentials in x and y directions with different spring constants. 2k x² and (1/2)k y². So, the potential is V(x, y) = (2k)x² + (1/2)k y².

So the Hamiltonian is H = H_x + H_y, where H_x = p_x²/(2m) + 2k x² and H_y = p_y²/(2m) + (1/2)k y². Therefore, because the potential is separable in Cartesian coordinates, we can solve each direction separately.

So each direction is a harmonic oscillator. In the x-direction, the spring constant is 2k, which has frequency ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), and in the y-direction, the spring constant is (1/2)k, so frequency ω_y = sqrt( (1/2)k / m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)).

So the energy levels would be the sum of the energies from each direction: E = E_x + E_y = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2), where n_x, n_y are non-negative integers.

Let me confirm that. Since for a harmonic oscillator in 1D, the energy levels are (n + 1/2) ħ ω. Therefore, applying that to each direction:

E(n_x, n_y) = (n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/(2m))

But the problem is two-dimensional, right? So in Cartesian coordinates, the solution is separable, so the total energy is the sum of the energies in x and y. Therefore, after converting the potential to Cartesian coordinates, if we separate variables correctly, we can write the energy spectrum as such.

Wait, but actually I converted the original given potential V(r, θ) into Cartesian coordinates and found V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Let's recheck this to avoid errors.

Original potential: V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ)

In Cartesian, r² = x² + y², cosθ = x/r, so r² cos²θ = x². Therefore:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 k)(x² + y²) + (3/2 k)(x²) = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²) = (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + 1/2 k y² = 2k x² +

Let me analyze a quantum mechanical problem involving a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ in polar coordinates, where k is a constant.

Initially, we have this potential expressed in polar coordinates. We can rewrite it by factoring out the common term (1/2)kr², giving us V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr²[1 + 3cos²θ]. Using the trigonometric identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, we can rewrite the potential as V(r, θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4)kr²cos2θ.

This form suggests the potential isn't easily separable in polar coordinates since it combines both radial and angular terms multiplicatively. However, we can transform this into Cartesian coordinates.

In Cartesian coordinates, we know that cos2θ = (x² - y²)/r² and r² = x² + y². Substituting these relations:

V(r, θ) = (5/4)k(x² + y²) + (3/4)k(x² - y²)

Combining like terms:
= (5/4 + 3/4)kx² + (5/4 - 3/4)ky²
= 2kx² + (1/2)ky²

This Cartesian form reveals that our potential is actually separable into x and y components! Each component represents a harmonic oscillator with different spring constants: 2k for the x-direction and (1/2)k for the y-direction.

For a harmonic oscillator, the frequencies are ω = √(k/m), where m is the mass. Therefore:
ω_x = √(2k/m) for the x-direction
ω_y = √(k/2m) for the y-direction

Since we have a separable system of two harmonic oscillators, the energy spectrum is:
E(n_x, n_y) = ħω_x(n_x + 1/2) + ħω_y(n_y + 1/2)
= ħ√(2k/m)(n_x + 1/2) + ħ√(k/2m)(n_y + 1/2)

where n_x and n_y are non-negative integers representing the quantum numbers for the x and y directions respectively.

This transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates has revealed that our seemingly complex potential actually describes a system of two independent harmonic oscillators with different frequencies, making the energy spectrum straightforward to determine.

Alright, let's rephrase the text while maintaining its meaning:

I need to determine the energy spectrum for a quantum particle moving in two dimensions under the potential V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let's break down the problem.

The particle is constrained to two dimensions, necessitating the use of polar coordinates (r, θ). The potential contains two components: one that is solely dependent on r, given by (1/2)kr², and another that involves both r and θ, which is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Therefore, the complete potential can be written as V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ). I'll check if this can be simplified or expressed differently.

By factoring out (1/2 kr²), the equation becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²)[1 + 3 cos²θ]

Alternatively, it can be (1/2 kr²)(1 + 3 cos²θ). I wonder if there’s a way to rewrite cos²θ to facilitate the separation of variables, since separable potentials are useful in quantum mechanics, especially in polar coordinates. Is a separation into radial and angular parts possible?

Utilizing cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2 yields:

1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ.

Thus, V(r, θ) simplifies to (1/2 kr²)*(5/2 + (3/2)cos2θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ). However, this approach shows the potential is not easily separable into purely radial and angular terms because it integrates r² with angular functions. If separable, the potential would be expressed as V(r, θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(θ), but the form here is V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) [1 + 3 cos²θ], meaning it separates multiplicatively rather than additively.

For the Schrödinger equation:

[-ħ²/(2m) (∇²)] ψ + V(r, θ) ψ = E ψ

When V is multiplicative in r and θ, the possibility of variable separation can be considered, though typically additive separation is used. In Cartesian systems, additive potentials allow for variable separation, but in polar systems, usually only the sum of radial and angular terms permits this, whereas the present form shows V(r, θ) = f(r)g(θ).

Perhaps an approximation or coordinate transformation could resolve this. Considering:

1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + (2 P_2 + 1) = 2(P_2 + 1), using the identity P_2(cosθ) = (3 cos²θ - 1)/2, hints that it can relate to a spherical harmonic structure. Though in 2D polar coordinates, angular dependence often aligns with Fourier series.

In polar coordinates, the angular solutions are e^{imθ} with integer m, suggesting cos²θ’s presence could be Fourier expanded. With cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, the potential reformulates to (1/2 kr²) + (3/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ).

Consequently, V(r, θ) = (5/4 kr²) + (3/4 kr² cos2θ) demonstrates an isotropic harmonic oscillator component and an angular-dependent term, making separation infeasible in polar coordinates. Perhaps another coordinate system could aid separation.

If transformed coordinates, like parabolic ones, are adopted, but assessing their suitability remains unclear here.

Maybe Cartesian coordinates help, given the angular term’s proportionality to cos2θ. Since cos2θ = (x² - y²)/r², and considering cosθ = x/r, we rewrite as:

V(r, θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4) k (x² - y²), where r² = x² + y².

Thus, this Cartesian form: V(x, y) = (5/4)k(x² + y²) + (3/4)k(x² - y²).

By simplifying:

= [5/4 k x² + 5/4 k y²] + [3/4 k x² - 3/4k y²]

Combining:

= (5/4 + 3/4)k x² + (5/4 - 3/4)k y²

= (8/4)k x² + (2/4)k y²

= 2k x² + (1/2)k y²

This implies the potential in Cartesian form is V(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)k y², indicating separability as harmonic potentials in the x and y directions with different constants. The energy involves H = H_x + H_y, where H_x = p_x²/(2m) + 2k x² and H_y = p_y²/(2m) + (1/2)k y², thus each component acts as an independent harmonic oscillator. The x-direction yields ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), and the y-direction yields ω_y = sqrt(k/(2m)).

The energy spectrum comprises E = E_x + E_y = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2), with n_x, n_y integers.

For each harmonic oscillator in 1D, energy levels are described by (n + 1/2) ħ ω. Accordingly, for this system:

E(n_x, n_y) = (n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/(2m)).

Recognizing this as a two-dimensional problem in Cartesian coordinates, separability allows us to state the energy spectrum as such.

Upon converting the original V(r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates, the potential resolves to V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Confirm the conversion:

Original potential: V(r, θ) = (1/2 kr²) + (3/2 kr² cos²θ)

Using r² = x² + y², cosine relationships construct:

V(r, θ) = (1/2 k)(x² + y²) + (3/2 k)(x²) = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²) = (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + 1/2 k y² = 2k x² +

So indeed, in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in x and y directions.\n\nTherefore, the energy spectrum will be the sum of the 1D harmonic oscillator energies in each direction:\n\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2)\n\nWhere ω_x = sqrt(2k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/(2m))\n\nSo we can write:\n\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2)\n\nLet me simplify sqrt(2k/m):\n\nsqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m), and sqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m). Let\'s factor out sqrt(k/m):\n\nThen:\n\nE(n_x, n_y) = sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2) ħ (n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) ħ (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nFactor out ħ and group terms:\n\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2) (n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nMaybe we can rationalize this further. Let me compute sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(2):\n\nsqrt(2) = 2^{1/2}, 1/sqrt(2) = 2^{-1/2}\n\nFactor out 2^{-1/2} = 1/sqrt(2):\n\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nBecause sqrt(2) = 2^{1/2} = 2 / sqrt(2), so multiplying sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 2, so:\n\nInside the bracket: 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) = 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2\n\nThus:\n\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/sqrt(2)) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nSimplify (1/sqrt(2)) as 2^{-1/2}:\n\nTherefore,\n\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ (k/m)^{1/2} * 2^{-1/2} (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nBut let me check the constants. The original energies of the harmonic oscillator are (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where ω = sqrt(k_spring / m). So for the x-direction, ω_x = sqrt(2k / m); for the y-direction, ω_y = sqrt( (k / 2)/m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)). Therefore, contributing their own frequencies.\n\nSo actually, let\'s think back. Is there a way to express the energy in terms of another quantum number or express as a combination? Maybe not necessary; probably leaving the answer in terms of n_x and n_y is acceptable.\n\nBut maybe, instead of n_x and n_y, if we use different quantum numbers or find a parameterization. But perhaps the problem expects this form. Wait, but maybe it\'s more precise.\n\nAlternatively, we could write in terms of sqrt(k/m):\n\nLet the overall energy scale be ħ sqrt(k/m). So let\'s define ω_0 = sqrt(k/m). Then ω_x = sqrt(2) ω_0 and ω_y = (1/sqrt(2)) ω_0.\n\nTherefore:\n\nE(n_x,n_y) = sqrt(2) ħ ω_0 (n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) ħ ω_0 (n_y + 1/2 )\n\nLet me factor out ħ ω_0 / sqrt(2):\n\nE(n_x,n_y) = (ħ ω_0 / sqrt(2)) [ 2(n_x + 1/2 ) + (n_y + 1/2 ) ]\n\nExpanding inside:\n\n= (ħ ω_0 / sqrt(2)) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]\n\n= (ħ ω_0 / sqrt(2)) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]\n\nSo E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) / sqrt(2) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nAlternatively, writing the constants more neatly:\n\nRecall that sqrt(k/m)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(k/(2m)). Wait:\n\nsqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m), which is the same as sqrt(k/m)/sqrt(2). So,\n\nE(n_x,n_y) = sqrt(k/(2m)) ħ (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )\n\nBut let me check that:\n\nIf ħ sqrt(k/m) / sqrt(2) is equal to ħ sqrt(k/(2m)):\n\nYes, because sqrt(k/m)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(k/(2m)).\n\nHence, E(n_x,n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). But, wait, hang on. The constants from the original two terms... Actually, maybe it\'s better to write it as exponents.\n\nAlternatively, leave it in the sum:\n\nE(n_x,n_y) = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ( sqrt(2) ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) ) + ( ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2) )\n\nYes, maybe it\'s better left in the original form.\n\nAlternatively, to express all in terms of k and m, one can write:\n\nE(n_x,n_y) = sqrt(2) ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2 )\n\n= sqrt( ħ^2 k/(2m) ) [ 2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) ]\n\nWait, again comes back to that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, factor out sqrt(ħ^2 k/(2m)):\n\nWait, let\'s compute each term:\n\nsqrt(2) * sqrt( ħ² k/m ) = sqrt(2) * sqrt( ħ² k/m ) = sqrt(2 ħ² k/m ) = ħ sqrt(2k/m)\n\nSimilarly, (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt( ħ² k/m ) = sqrt( ħ² k/(2m) )\n\nTherefore, expressing:\n\nE = sqrt(2) * sqrt(ħ² k/m) (n_x +1/2) + sqrt(ħ² k/(2m)) (n_y +1/2 )\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe better to keep in composite terms. Let\'s perhaps define ω_x and ω_y:\n\nω_x = sqrt(2k/m), ω_y = sqrt(k/(2m))\n\nThen the energy is simply:\n\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 )\n\nBut the problem states "Find the energy spectrum". So my answer will involve this expression. Maybe leave it at that.\n\nAlternatively, substitute ω_x and ω_y values back into the expression. Let\'s compute:\n\nω_x = sqrt(2k/m), so ħ ω_x = ħ sqrt(2k/m), same with ħ ω_y = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)).\n\nSo perhaps the answer is:\n\nE_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2), for n_x, n_y non-negative integers.\n\nThat seems correct. To check, we can see that if the potential were isotropic, which would be if V(r) = 1/2 kr² in both x and y. Then, in that case, energy levels would be ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + n_y + 1). Which matches the sum of each direction if frequencies are the same. Here, the frequencies are different in x and y, so the energy levels are slightly different.\n\nAlternatively, we can see the x-direction is more stiff (higher spring constant 2k) hence higher frequency, and y-direction is a softer spring (spring constant k/2). So energy contributions are different.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: we could have also performed a coordinate scaling. Let me think. If we define a coordinate transformation that scales x and y such that the potential becomes isotropic. For example, define u = x * sqrt(2k)/m and v = y * sqrt(k/2)/m? Wait, perhaps not directly useful, but Sometimes when dealing with anisotropic harmonic oscillators, you can scale variables to make it look isotropic, then separate variables.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the anisotropic oscillator in 2D can still be separable in Cartesian coordinates, which we\'ve already used.\n\nTherefore, probably the most straightforward answer is to write E(n_x, n_y) = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2), with ω_x and ω_y as given. So substituting those expressions:\n\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2).\n\nTherefore, combing the terms:\n\nFactor out ħ sqrt(k/m):\n\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2)(n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(n_y + 1/2) ]\n\nYes, again. But in any case, that\'s the expression. Therefore, the energy levels are given by that expression for non-negative integers n_x and n_y.\n\nTherefore, I think that\'s the answer. Let me check if I didn\'t make any miscalculations:\n\nGiven V(r,θ) when converted to Cartesian is V(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)k y², which is indeed a combination of two different harmonic oscillators. Then, the frequencies are ω_x = sqrt(2k/m) and ω_y = sqrt((1/2 k)/m) = sqrt(k/(2m)). Therefore, the energy levels are (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y +1/2)ħω_y. Yes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rewrite using multi-index notation? But since the problem allows both n_x and n_y, the answer would involve two quantum numbers. Since the energy levels depend on both n_x and n_y.\n\nAn alternative thought: because the problem was originally given in polar coordinates and the solution coordinate system was transformed to Cartesian. But in Cartesian, the variables separate, so we can use that coordinate system. Therefore, choice of coordinates is essential here.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we didn\'t change coordinates and attempted to solve in polar coordinates. How hard would that be? Well, our potential in polar coordinates is (1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ) = kr²/2(1 + 3 cos²θ). So substituting that into Schrodinger equation:\n\n[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²/∂θ² ) + V(r, θ) ] ψ(r,θ) = E ψ(r, θ)\n\nIf one tried separation of variables ψ(r, θ) = R(r) Θ(θ), then potential V(r,θ) is not a sum but a product. So Laplace operator -ħ²/(2m)[... ] would lead to equations where variables are not separated because the potential depends on r and θ multiplicatively. Therefore separation might not be straightforward. Hence switching to Cartesian coordinates allows decoupling.\n\nTherefore, transforming to Cartesian coordinates indeed simplifies the problem.\n\nTherefore, concluding that the energy spectrum is:\n\nE(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2)\n\nSummarizing, the energy eigenvalues are determined by two quantum numbers n_x and n_y (non-negative integers), each term corresponding to the energy contributions from the harmonic oscillators in x and y directions with their respective frequencies. That seems reasonable.\n\nJust to make sure there are no miscalculations, plug n_x=0, n_y=0, check the ground state energy:\n\nE(0,0)= ħ sqrt(2k/m) (1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (1/2 )\n\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2)/2 + (1)/(2 sqrt(2)) ]\n\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (sqrt(2)/2 + 1/(2 sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\nCombine the terms. Rationalize:\n\nsqrt(2)/2 = 1/sqrt(2). So,\n\n= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (1/sqrt(2) + 1/(2 sqrt(2))) ] = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (3/ (2 sqrt(2)) ) ]\n\n= (3/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ħ sqrt(k/m)\n\nWhich is alternatively (3/2) ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) sqrt(2))? Wait,\n\nWait, sqrt(k/m) divided by sqrt(2) is sqrt(k/(2m)), so yes:\n\n(3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/(2m))\n\nBut perhaps that\'s more of a test that the ground state checks out.\n\nAlternatively, the standard harmonic oscillator in x and y would have energy (n_x + 1/2 + n_y + 1/2)ħω if isotropic. Here, with different frequencies, the energy is just the sum.\n\nHence, no mistakes detected in reasoning here. Therefore, I\'d say this is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy spectrum is given by \\boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{2k}{m}} \\left(n_x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{2m}} \\left(n_y + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)} where \\(n_x\\) and \\(n_y\\) are non-negative integers.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1741156432, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3822, prompt_tokens=2319, total_tokens=6141, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions under the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{2} kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

The given potential can be rewritten as:
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2} kr^2 + \frac{3}{4} kr^2 (1 + \cos(2\theta))
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(2\theta) = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2}\), we convert to Cartesian coordinates:
\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2} k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{4} k(x^2 - y^2)
\]
Simplifying this expression, we get:
\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2
\]
This potential represents an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions. The Hamiltonian for this system is separable in Cartesian coordinates:
\[
H = H_x + H_y = \left( \frac{p_x^2}{2m} + 2kx^2 \right) + \left( \frac{p_y^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \right)
\]
The energy levels for each harmonic oscillator are given by:
\[
E_x = \hbar \omega_x \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right) \quad \text{and} \quad E_y = \hbar \omega_y \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)
\]
where the angular frequencies are:
\[
\omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} \quad \text{and} \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}}
\]
Combining these, the total energy spectrum is:
\[
E(n_x, n_y) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} \left( n_x + \frac{1}{2} \right) + \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \left( n_y + \frac{1}{2} \right)
\]

### Final Answer
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.

 (1/2)k y².

Yes, so correct. So indeed, in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is an anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in x and y directions.

Therefore, the energy spectrum will be the sum of the 1D harmonic oscillator energies in each direction:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2)

Where ω_x = sqrt(2k/m) and ω_y = sqrt(k/(2m))

So we can write:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2)

Let me simplify sqrt(2k/m):

sqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m), and sqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m). Let's factor out sqrt(k/m):

Then:

E(n_x, n_y) = sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2) ħ (n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) ħ (n_y + 1/2) ]

Factor out ħ and group terms:

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2) (n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) (n_y + 1/2) ]

Maybe we can rationalize this further. Let me compute sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(2):

sqrt(2) = 2^{1/2}, 1/sqrt(2) = 2^{-1/2}

Factor out 2^{-1/2} = 1/sqrt(2):

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/sqrt(2)) [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ]

Because sqrt(2) = 2^{1/2} = 2 / sqrt(2), so multiplying sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 2, so:

Inside the bracket: 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) = 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2

Thus:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) * (1/sqrt(2)) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Simplify (1/sqrt(2)) as 2^{-1/2}:

Therefore,

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ (k/m)^{1/2} * 2^{-1/2} (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But let me check the constants. The original energies of the harmonic oscillator are (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where ω = sqrt(k_spring / m). So for the x-direction, ω_x = sqrt(2k / m); for the y-direction, ω_y = sqrt( (k / 2)/m ) = sqrt(k/(2m)). Therefore, contributing their own frequencies.

So actually, let's think back. Is there a way to express the energy in terms of another quantum number or express as a combination? Maybe not necessary; probably leaving the answer in terms of n_x and n_y is acceptable.

But maybe, instead of n_x and n_y, if we use different quantum numbers or find a parameterization. But perhaps the problem expects this form. Wait, but maybe it's more precise.

Alternatively, we could write in terms of sqrt(k/m):

Let the overall energy scale be ħ sqrt(k/m). So let's define ω_0 = sqrt(k/m). Then ω_x = sqrt(2) ω_0 and ω_y = (1/sqrt(2)) ω_0.

Therefore:

E(n_x,n_y) = sqrt(2) ħ ω_0 (n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) ħ ω_0 (n_y + 1/2 )

Let me factor out ħ ω_0 / sqrt(2):

E(n_x,n_y) = (ħ ω_0 / sqrt(2)) [ 2(n_x + 1/2 ) + (n_y + 1/2 ) ]

Expanding inside:

= (ħ ω_0 / sqrt(2)) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]

= (ħ ω_0 / sqrt(2)) [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

So E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) / sqrt(2) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Alternatively, writing the constants more neatly:

Recall that sqrt(k/m)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(k/(2m)). Wait:

sqrt(k/(2m)) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m), which is the same as sqrt(k/m)/sqrt(2). So,

E(n_x,n_y) = sqrt(k/(2m)) ħ (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But let me check that:

If ħ sqrt(k/m) / sqrt(2) is equal to ħ sqrt(k/(2m)):

Yes, because sqrt(k/m)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(k/(2m)).

Hence, E(n_x,n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ). But, wait, hang on. The constants from the original two terms... Actually, maybe it's better to write it as exponents.

Alternatively, leave it in the sum:

E(n_x,n_y) = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2) = ( sqrt(2) ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) ) + ( ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2) )

Yes, maybe it's better left in the original form.

Alternatively, to express all in terms of k and m, one can write:

E(n_x,n_y) = sqrt(2) ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2)) ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_y + 1/2 )

= sqrt( ħ^2 k/(2m) ) [ 2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) ]

Wait, again comes back to that. Hmm.

Alternatively, factor out sqrt(ħ^2 k/(2m)):

Wait, let's compute each term:

sqrt(2) * sqrt( ħ² k/m ) = sqrt(2) * sqrt( ħ² k/m ) = sqrt(2 ħ² k/m ) = ħ sqrt(2k/m)

Similarly, (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt( ħ² k/m ) = sqrt( ħ² k/(2m) )

Therefore, expressing:

E = sqrt(2) * sqrt(ħ² k/m) (n_x +1/2) + sqrt(ħ² k/(2m)) (n_y +1/2 )

But perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe better to keep in composite terms. Let's perhaps define ω_x and ω_y:

ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), ω_y = sqrt(k/(2m))

Then the energy is simply:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 )

But the problem states "Find the energy spectrum". So my answer will involve this expression. Maybe leave it at that.

Alternatively, substitute ω_x and ω_y values back into the expression. Let's compute:

ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), so ħ ω_x = ħ sqrt(2k/m), same with ħ ω_y = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)).

So perhaps the answer is:

E_{n_x, n_y} = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2), for n_x, n_y non-negative integers.

That seems correct. To check, we can see that if the potential were isotropic, which would be if V(r) = 1/2 kr² in both x and y. Then, in that case, energy levels would be ħ sqrt(k/m) (n_x + n_y + 1). Which matches the sum of each direction if frequencies are the same. Here, the frequencies are different in x and y, so the energy levels are slightly different.

Alternatively, we can see the x-direction is more stiff (higher spring constant 2k) hence higher frequency, and y-direction is a softer spring (spring constant k/2). So energy contributions are different.

Alternatively, another approach: we could have also performed a coordinate scaling. Let me think. If we define a coordinate transformation that scales x and y such that the potential becomes isotropic. For example, define u = x * sqrt(2k)/m and v = y * sqrt(k/2)/m? Wait, perhaps not directly useful, but Sometimes when dealing with anisotropic harmonic oscillators, you can scale variables to make it look isotropic, then separate variables.

Alternatively, notice that the anisotropic oscillator in 2D can still be separable in Cartesian coordinates, which we've already used.

Therefore, probably the most straightforward answer is to write E(n_x, n_y) = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2), with ω_x and ω_y as given. So substituting those expressions:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2).

Therefore, combing the terms:

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2)(n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(n_y + 1/2) ]

Yes, again. But in any case, that's the expression. Therefore, the energy levels are given by that expression for non-negative integers n_x and n_y.

Therefore, I think that's the answer. Let me check if I didn't make any miscalculations:

Given V(r,θ) when converted to Cartesian is V(x, y) = 2kx² + (1/2)k y², which is indeed a combination of two different harmonic oscillators. Then, the frequencies are ω_x = sqrt(2k/m) and ω_y = sqrt((1/2 k)/m) = sqrt(k/(2m)). Therefore, the energy levels are (n_x + 1/2)ħω_x + (n_y +1/2)ħω_y. Yes, correct.

Alternatively, maybe rewrite using multi-index notation? But since the problem allows both n_x and n_y, the answer would involve two quantum numbers. Since the energy levels depend on both n_x and n_y.

An alternative thought: because the problem was originally given in polar coordinates and the solution coordinate system was transformed to Cartesian. But in Cartesian, the variables separate, so we can use that coordinate system. Therefore, choice of coordinates is essential here.

Alternatively, suppose we didn't change coordinates and attempted to solve in polar coordinates. How hard would that be? Well, our potential in polar coordinates is (1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ) = kr²/2(1 + 3 cos²θ). So substituting that into Schrodinger equation:

[-ħ²/(2m) ( (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²/∂θ² ) + V(r, θ) ] ψ(r,θ) = E ψ(r, θ)

If one tried separation of variables ψ(r, θ) = R(r) Θ(θ), then potential V(r,θ) is not a sum but a product. So Laplace operator -ħ²/(2m)[... ] would lead to equations where variables are not separated because the potential depends on r and θ multiplicatively. Therefore separation might not be straightforward. Hence switching to Cartesian coordinates allows decoupling.

Therefore, transforming to Cartesian coordinates indeed simplifies the problem.

Therefore, concluding that the energy spectrum is:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2)

Summarizing, the energy eigenvalues are determined by two quantum numbers n_x and n_y (non-negative integers), each term corresponding to the energy contributions from the harmonic oscillators in x and y directions with their respective frequencies. That seems reasonable.

Just to make sure there are no miscalculations, plug n_x=0, n_y=0, check the ground state energy:

E(0,0)= ħ sqrt(2k/m) (1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (1/2 )

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2)/2 + (1)/(2 sqrt(2)) ]

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (sqrt(2)/2 + 1/(2 sqrt(2)) ) ]

Combine the terms. Rationalize:

sqrt(2)/2 = 1/sqrt(2). So,

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (1/sqrt(2) + 1/(2 sqrt(2))) ] = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (3/ (2 sqrt(2)) ) ]

= (3/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ħ sqrt(k/m)

Which is alternatively (3/2) ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) sqrt(2))? Wait,

Wait, sqrt(k/m) divided by sqrt(2) is sqrt(k/(2m)), so yes:

(3/2) * ħ * sqrt(k/(2m))

But perhaps that's more of a test that the ground state checks out.

Alternatively, the standard harmonic oscillator in x and y would have energy (n_x + 1/2 + n_y + 1/2)ħω if isotropic. Here, with different frequencies, the energy is just the sum.

Hence, no mistakes detected in reasoning here. Therefore, I'd say this is the answer.

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The provided potential can be transformed into a separable problem in Cartesian coordinates. Here's the solution for the energy spectrum:

**Energy Spectrum:**
\[
E(n_x, n_y) = \hbar\sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}}\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{2m}}\left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]
**Quantum Numbers:** \(n_x, n_y = 0, 1, 2, \dots\)

---

**Explanation:**

1. **Potential Transformation:**
   - Original polar coordinates: 
     \[
     V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2\cos^2\theta
     \]
   - Trigonometric identity: \(\cos^2\theta = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2}\) simplifies the potential to:
     \[
     V(r, \theta) = \frac{5}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2\cos(2\theta)
     \]
   - Convert to Cartesian coordinates using \(\cos(2\theta) = (x^2 - y^2)/r^2\):
     \[
     V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2
     \]

2. **Harmonic Oscillator Separation:**
   - The transformed potential describes two decoupled 1D harmonic oscillators along \(x\) and \(y\) with effective spring constants \(k_x = 2k\) and \(k_y = \frac{1}{2}k\).

3. **Energy Levels:**
   - Frequency for each oscillator: 
     \[
     \omega_x = \sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k/2}{m}}
     \]
   - Total energy sums contributions from both oscillators:
     \[
     E(n_x, n_y) = \underbrace{\hbar\omega_x\!\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)}_{x\text{-oscillator}} + \underbrace{\hbar\omega_y\!\left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)}_{y\text{-oscillator}}
     \]

This energy spectrum corresponds to quantized levels in both directions, governed by the quantum numbers \(n_x\) and \(n_y\).

To find the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in two dimensions under the potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \), we start by converting the potential into Cartesian coordinates. 

First, express the given potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates using \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) and \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{r} \):
\[
V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \frac{3}{2}k x^2
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}k x^2 + \frac{1}{2}k y^2 + \frac{3}{2}k x^2 = 2k x^2 + \frac{1}{2}k y^2
\]

This potential represents a two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions. The potential separates into two independent harmonic oscillators in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions:
- For the \( x \)-direction: \( V(x) = 2k x^2 \)
- For the \( y \)-direction: \( V(y) = \frac{1}{2}k y^2 \)

The angular frequencies of these oscillators are:
- \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)
- \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \)

The energy levels for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator are given by \( E_n = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{1}{2}) \). Therefore, combining the energies from both directions:
\[
E(n_x, n_y) = \hbar \omega_x \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \omega_y \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Substituting the frequencies \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \):
\[
E(n_x, n_y) = \hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):
\[
E(n_x, n_y) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2\left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right)
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
E(n_x, n_y) = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)
\]

Thus, the energy spectrum is given by:
\[
\boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)}
\]
where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers.

 (1/2)k y².

This indeed conforms; prior algebraic steps are correct. Hence, transformed into Cartesian coordinates, which decouples the potential into x and y parts with different spring constants, gives two separate harmonic oscillators.

Given that standard harmonic oscillator quantization in each direction applies, the energy levels combine. Therefore, E(n_x, n_y) = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2). Compute ω_x and ω_y for V(x, y):

In the x-direction: V(x) = 2k x², the effective "spring constant" is 2k, so ω_x = sqrt( (2k) / m ).

In the y-direction: V(y) = (1/2)k y²; Effective spring constant equivalent to along y is (1/2)k since energy is (1/2) k2 y² = (k/2) y² (where k2 is the spring constant in the standard form), so ω_y = sqrt( (k/2)/m ) = sqrt( k/(2m) ). These frequencies align with previous expressions.

Therefore, the total energy becomes:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2)

Perhaps simplifying terms:

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2)(n_x + 1/2) + (1/√2)(n_y + 1/2) ]

Further factor ± sqrt(2)/sqrt(2):

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ (sqrt(2) n_x + sqrt(2)/2) + (n_y/sqrt(2) + 1/(2 sqrt(2))) ]

Perhaps combining terms:

But maybe it's better left expressed as:

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y + 1/2 )

Alternatively, factor out sqrt(k/m):

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2)(n_x + 1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(n_y + 1/2) ]

Further simplifying the bracketed term:

sqrt(2)(n_x +1/2) + 1/sqrt(2)(n_y +1/2) can be written by expressing as [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)] / sqrt(2)

Wait, let's check:

Multiply sqrt(2)/sqrt(2):

sqrt(2)*a + (1/sqrt(2))*b = (sqrt(2) a + b/sqrt(2)) = (2a + b)/sqrt(2)

Indeed:

sqrt(2)a + (1/sqrt(2))b = [sqrt(2)^2 a + b]/sqrt(2) since sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 1.

Thus:

[2a + b]/sqrt(2).

Therefore:

Inside [sqrt(2)(n_x +1/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(n_y +1/2)] = [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)] / sqrt(2)

Therefore, E becomes:

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)] / sqrt(2)

= ħ sqrt(k/m)/sqrt(2) [2(n_x +1/2) + n_y +1/2 ]

Simplify denominator:

sqrt(2) is √2, and multiplication by 1/√2 converts to √(1/2). Alternatively:

= (ħ / sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m) [2n_x +1 +n_y + 0.5 ]

= (ħ √(k/(2m)) ) [2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ]

So E(n_x, n_y) = (ħ √(k/(2m)) ) (2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

But wait, verifying:

2(n_x +1/2) is 2n_x +1

Then added to (n_y + 1/2): so 2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x +n_y + 3/2

Thus, yes: E = ħ √(k/(2m)) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )

Alternatively:

Alternatively, in another approach, can we quantize in x and y with frequencies sqrt(4k/m) and sqrt(k/m) respectively? Wait, no, original variables in x have effective ω_x= sqrt(2k/m) and ω_y= sqrt(k/(2m)).

But here, noting that expressing in terms of quantum numbers n_x and n_y, which are non-negative integers. However, sometimes in such separable oscillator systems, the energy spectrum may be cast in terms of other quantum numbers if an orthogonal transformation is viable, but in this case, it just x and y used.

Alternatively, to express the energies as given?

Ah, perhaps standard form is better in terms of E(n_x,n_y), given as additive terms. Let me verify if that would suffice as the answer.

Aligning with the distinct frequencies in each direction, the answer would accept the form E = (n_x +1/2)ħω_x + (n_y +1/2)ħω_y, where ω_x = sqrt(2k/m),ω_y= sqrt(k/(2m)), so named explicitly.

Alternatively, is there a way to reconcile this spectrum by considering angular momentum, but given that converting to Cartesian coordinates trivializes the problem into known oscillator solutions, perhaps that is easiest and sufficient.

But using two different energies in perpendicular directions, as such.

Alternatively, the original problem is presented in polar coordinates, so maybe the expected method is to consider it in polar coordinates. If converting to Cartesian is foolproof, then we can proceed as above but for safety, need to confirm whether that is valid.

But the potential in the problem is given in polar coordinates yet translates to a harmonic Cartesian potential when properly transformed. However, because potentials considered in polars depending on r and θ convert directly to positions in Cartesian, which is allowed—thereby revealing a separable potential in Cartesian terms.

Therefore, solving via separation in Cartesian coordinates is legitimate, leading to the energy expression obtained.

Alternatively, perhaps equivalent approaches exist such as variable separation in polar coordinates, but for this specific form, Cartesian coordinates evade complications. Hence, positing the problem for separation in Cartesian coordinates.

Conclusion: The system can be modeled as two independent 1D harmonic oscillators in the x and y directions with differing spring constants. Then energy levels determined in these directions can simply be summed.

Thus, the energy spectrum is E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (n_x + 1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) (n_y +1/2) for non-negative integers n_x, n_y.

Simplifying terms:

Alternatively, factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ sqrt(k/m) [ sqrt(2) (n_x +1/2 ) + (1/√2)(n_y +1/2 ) ]

Factor 1/√2:

= ħ sqrt(k/m) / sqrt(2) [ 2(n_x +1/2 ) + (n_y +1/2 ) ]

= ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) [ 2n_x +1 +n_y +0.5 ]

= ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) ( 2n_x +n_y + 1.5 )

Since n_x and n_y are integers starting from 0, that can cover all possibilities. Distinguishing between even and odd coefficients.

But in testing, the combination 2n_x +n_y can produce all non-negative integers?

This is by different combinations? Let n_x = p, so for each p, 2p can be built. So suppose, examples:

If n_x=0, n_y can be 0,1,2,..., so total term = n_y + 1.5 ;

For n_x=1, total term 2 +n_y + 1.5= n_y + 3.5

n_x=2: 4 +n_y +1.5

But the general energy expression "E = ħ sqrt(k/(2m)) * (2n_x + n_y + 1.5 )" alternatively but know for given numbers n_x,n_y, these can combine to produce distinct energies? Or potentially degeneracy across different (n_x,n_y).

This could express the spectrum, but maybe presenting it as E(n_x,n_y)= sqrt(2)(n_x +1/2) + 1/sqrt(2)(n_y +1/2) ) * ħ sqrt(k/m), which is additive.

Alternatively, since the problem could expect a compact form, either expression is acceptable, but perhaps leaving in terms of n_x and n_y is more straightforward?

If summarized: E(n_x, n_y)= (n_x +1/2)ħ ω_x + (n_y +1/2 )ħ ω_y
where ω_x= sqrt(2k/m) and ω_y = sqrt( k/(2m) )

The potential's Cartesian conversion thoroughly decouples the system into two perpendicular harmonic oscillators in x and y directions with different frequencies, hence, behavior.

Therefore, agreed, the energy spectrum is just the sum of the two harmonic oscillator energies.

Hence, the answer is correct with:

Enx,ny = ħ sqrt(2k/m) (nx + ½ ) + ħ sqrt( k/(2m) ) ( ny +½ )

Alternatively, that's the answer. Alternatively expressed:

E = ħ sqrt( k/(2m) ) [ sqrt(2) (nx + ½ ) + (ny +½ ) / sqrt(2) ) ]

Or  scale expression here by multiplying denominators.

But check whether if someone mistakenly uses the original polar system. Because transforming to Cartesian provides separable variables.

But yes, parallels drawn to two separate 1-D HO. Thus,

Thus, Final answer would be sum of both harmonic oscillators. Confirm through normal method.

In x-direction: Potential (1/2)m ω_x^2 x^2 = 2k x^2, so ω_x = sqrt( 4k / m )).

Wait, error here, because the Harmonic oscillator energy for x component: (1/2) m ω_x² x² = 2k x². So ω_x calculated as:

m ω_x² = 4k → ω_x = sqrt(4k / m ). However, initially written as ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), bad.

Wait, fundamental error, recalculating.

If potential in x is 2k x², equating to (1/2)m ω_x² x², then comparing:

(1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2*sqrt(k/m). So yes, For the x-component.

Similarly for the y-component: potential is (k/2 ) y² = (1/2 m ω_y² y²)). Thus,

(1/2 m ω_y²) = k/2 → m ω_y² = k → ω_y = sqrt(k/m )

Wait a second, this contradicts prior calculation. So perhaps initial analysis made a mistake.

Ah, key step here:

Potential in x: Vx = 2k x². Equating to HO potential (1/2)m ω_x²x². Thus:

(1/2)m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = 4k/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m )

Similarly Vy = (1/2)k y². Equate to HO potential (1/2)m ω_y² y² →

(1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m )

Thus omega in x is 2 sqrt(k/m ), omega in y sqrt( k/m )

Thus, original energy expression writes as

E(n_x, n_y) = ħ *2*sqrt(k/m )*(n_x +1/2) + ħ*sqrt(k/m)(n_y +1/2 )

Factor out sqrt(k/m):

= ħ sqrt(k/m)[ 2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2 ) ]

= ħ sqrt(k/m)[ 2n_x + n_y + 1.5 ]

Therefore, detail correction, early miscalculation corrected here.

This revises the earlier expression where m vs k factors were causing confusion. So omega_x=2 sqrt(k/m ), omega_y= sqrt(k/m )

Thus, energy expression factoring those frequencies:

E(n_x, n_y)= ħ(2√(k/m ))(n_x +1/2) + ħ sqrt(k/m)(n_y +1/2 )

Further,

E(n_x, n_y)= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2) ]

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x +1 +n_y +1/2 ]

= ħ sqrt(k/m) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )

Which aligns with the previous conclusion, hence concluding the energy is in terms of quantum numbers as above.

Moral of the story:  Angular triggered from the original V(r,θ) translates into anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Uncertainty emerges from angle until conversion. Alternatively consider a combination in different directions with multiplicities.

Confirming the transformation once again given V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Convert to Cartesian:

- 1/2 k (x² + y²) + 3/2 k x².

Then:

1/2 k (x² + y²) +3/2 k x²= (1/2 +3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y²= 2k x² + (1/2) k y².

Which implies:

(Angular term redistributes as multiplies in x and likewise simple terms. Then for the x and y directions, the potential components imply harmonic motion.

Hence, conversions are correct. A related step I took some time to realize that's V is anisotropic. Typically harmonic oscillators in 2D are isotropic (same for x and y). Anisotropic osi altet result in different frequency  members.

Thus the energy levels are not equidistant necessarily, but for each quantum direction is proportionate to n i along x and y.

Adding it up, substituting frequencies:

Thus, the answer to be derived is:

E(nx, ny)= ℏ sqrt(k/m ) (2n_x +n_y + 3/2 )

Alternatively, another form, but essentially this.

Therefore, deeming this the correct path .

**Final Answer**
The energy spectrum is given by \boxed{E_{n_x, n_y} = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)} where \(n_x\) and \(n_y\) are non-negative integers.
