Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B), we analyze the given compounds as follows:

**Part A: Tautomerism**

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring in para positions. The adjacent carbons to the carbonyl groups are part of the conjugated aromatic ring system. The aromatic stability makes the enol form highly unfavorable because it disrupts the conjugation. Therefore, benzoquinone does not undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Each carbonyl group is adjacent to two CH₂ groups, providing alpha hydrogens. These alpha hydrogens allow for keto-enol tautomerism. The enol form can gain aromatic stability (similar to phloroglucinol), making tautomerism favorable.

**Conclusion for Part A**: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

**Part B: Optical Isomerism**

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH₃), a carbonyl group (COOCH₃), and a hydrogen (H). This creates a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism (enantiomers).

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure is (E)-CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule has a trans double bond (geometric isomerism) but no chiral centers due to its symmetry. Thus, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer

The compound that does not show tautomerism is \boxed{benzoquinone}, and the compound that shows optical isomerism is \boxed{methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate}.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out two things here: first, which compound doesn't show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and second, whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. Let me start with the first part. 

Tautomerism is when a compound can exist in two or more structural isomers that can interconvert via a chemical reaction, usually involving the movement of a proton and the shifting of double bonds. The most common type is keto-enol tautomerism. For that to happen, the compound needs to have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an ester) and a hydrogen atom alpha to the carbonyl (like an adjacent CH group), so that the hydrogen can move to the carbonyl oxygen, forming an enol structure.

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Let's draw its structure: benzene ring with two oxygen double-bonded to two carbons opposite each other (para positions). Since all the carbons in the ring are either part of the aromatic ring or double-bonded to oxygen, there might not be any alpha hydrogens. Wait, each ketone is at the para position. The ketone groups are at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene. The carbons adjacent to the ketones would be the ones attached to the benzene. Let me think. In benzoquinone, each quinone structure has two ketone groups. Benzene ring with two=O groups. Now, if I look at the alpha carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl), those carbons are part of the aromatic ring. The hydrogen on the neighboring carbons... Wait, benzene is a conjugated ring, but once you have the quinone structure, the double bonds are possibly fixed. Wait, perhaps not. But for tautomerism (like keto-enol), we need an alpha hydrogen. But in the case of benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic system. Let's consider 1,4-benzoquinone. The structure is O=C6H4=C=O in the para positions. Each carbonyl is exocyclic. The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. But in the case of benzoquinone, those alpha carbons are part of the ring, which is fully conjugated. The carbonyl groups are conjugated with the ring. Does benzoquinone have any alpha hydrogens? The alpha carbons would be the ones next to the carbonyls. In benzoquinone's case, each carbonyl is attached to two adjacent ring carbons. For a hydrogen to be adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl, those carbons would need to have H's. But carbonyls are usually in positions where their adjacent carbons are part of the ring. If the carbonyl is in the para positions on benzene, each would be attached to a carbon that is part of the ring, but in the quinone structure, there are double bonds. Wait, maybe the structure of benzoquinone isn't exactly benzene with two ketones. Wait, actually, benzoquinone would have two double bonds in the ring. Let me check my organic chemistry. Benzoquinone has a structure where two of the benzene ring's double bonds have been converted into ketone groups. So maybe the actual structure of 1,4-benzoquinone is a conjugated system with two ketone groups in para positions. Let's see: the ring has alternating double bonds, but two are replaced by carbonyl groups. So in that case, perhaps the alpha carbons here can't have hydrogens because those carbons are part of the double bond? Hmm... Wait, the carbons with the carbonyl groups are each connected to an oxygen via a double bond. Let’s take the 1,4 positions. Carbon 1 has a double bond to oxygen (carbonyl), carbon 4 also has a double bond to oxygen. Then the adjacent carbons (such as carbon 2 and 6 next to carbon 1) might be in a conjugated double bond. Depending on the actual structure, maybe those positions will not have hydrogens. But maybe in benzoquinone, the alpha positions (adjacent to the carbonyls) are actually carbons involved in double bonds. If the adjacent carbons are part of the conjugated double bonds within the ring, then those carbons don't have hydrogens. Because if a carbon is part of a double bond (sp² hybridized), it can have one hydrogen (if substituents allow). Wait, in benzene each carbon has a single H. When quinone is formed, replacing two adjacent CH groups with carbonyl groups, but maybe changing the bonding. No, actually 1,4-benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. So the structure would be: ring positions 1 and 4 have the carbonyls. Then carbons 2 and 6 adjacent to carbonyl at 1 would be each bonded to another carbon. Maybe those carbons (2 and 3, for example) have double bonds. But since it's a quinone, all of the ring is conjugated. If a carbonyl is at position 1, then there needs to be a conjugated double bond between 1-2, but position 1 is double-bonded to oxygen, so maybe alternate the conjugation. Hmmm... I might need another approach here. 

For keto-enol tautomerism, the enol form requires an adjacent alcohol group (enol) next to a carbonyl. So, if the compound doesn’t have an alpha hydrogen (hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl), it can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Similarly, other types of tautomerism, like lactam-lactim, etc., might require specific groups.

So we need to check if benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens. 

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each carbonyl group is on the cyclohexane ring. Let's visualize this: a six-membered ring with ketones at positions 1, 3, 5. So each of those carbons is a carbonyl. The carbons adjacent to each carbonyl would be the ring carbons next to each ketone. For example, carbon 2 is next to ketone at 1 and 3, and so on. Wait, let me see structurally. If each ketone is on the cyclohexane, the positions between them (like 2,4,6) might have CH2 groups. Wait, no. If it's cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, then each of these positions (1,3,5) is a carbonyl (O=C-). So the ring is probably in a chair-like structure, but with three carbonyl oxygens. Each carbonyl group (C=O) is connected to three different positions. Let's think in a planar structure. So positions 1,3,5 each have a C=O, connected to the ring. Then, the adjacent carbons (2, 4, 6) would each be next to two ketone groups. For example, carbon 2 is adjacent to position 1 and position 3 ketones. But each of those neighboring carbonyl carbons would be part of the ring. So, does cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens? The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl would need to have at least one hydrogen atom. Wait, if each ketone is on the cyclohexane, then the adjacent carbons must be CH2 or CH groups. But in this trione compound, each ketone is bonded to a carbon that is part of the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, for example, for cyclohexane (a six-membered ring with all single bonds), substituting positions 1,3,5 with ketones, so we'd have three carbonyl groups. Each of the ketone carbons (positions 1, 3, 5) are connected to the ring carbons. Then, the adjacent carbons (for ketone 1: carbons 6 and 2) might each have two hydrogens. Wait, if the cyclohexane is fully single-bonded, then those adjacent carbons would have two hydrogens each. But wait, if there are ketone groups at positions 1, 3, 5 replacing the CH2 groups, then those would be C=O instead. But now, the carbons adjacent to the ketone (positions 6 and 2 from position 1) would form the cyclohexane ring. So that is each of the adjacent positions would have two CH2 groups (if on cyclohexane). But actually, let me get this straight: suppose something like cyclohexane, but where at positions 1,3,5, they have ketone groups. So in each of positions 1,3,5, their structure is C=O instead of CH2. Then the ring would have alternating single bonds (because cyclic), but the carbonyls are at those positions. Then, the adjacent carbons (say, next to 1) would be positions 2 and 6 (both CH2 groups?), but in a cyclohexanetrione, possibly the carbonyl groups are in such a way that adjacent positions are part of the ring. But regardless, I need to figure out whether the adjacent carbons have hydrogens. If the carbons next to each ketone (the alpha carbons) have H atoms, then the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, after substituting three CH2 groups with C=O, the adjacent carbons would be CH2 (between ketones), so those carbons (positions 2,4,6) would each have two H's. Therefore, each has alpha hydrogens. Therefore, they could potentially undergo tautomerism. If each has alpha hydrogens, which they do (each adjacent C is CH2), then they can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, though, may not have alpha hydrogens. Because in the cyclohexane ring with ketone group, each ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbons are part of the conjugated ring. Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at para positions. But in benzene, each carbon is part of the conjugated double bonds. If those double bonds are fixed in the quinone structure. For example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons to the carbonyls (positions 2 and 6, adjacent to position 1 and 3,5 adjacent to position 4) would be in conjugation. However, maybe those adjacent carbons don't actually have any hydrogen. Because in benzene (C6H6), each carbon has one H. But when converting it to benzoquinone, which two carbons are involved?

Wait, benzoquinone is derived from benzene by replacing two CH groups with carbonyl groups. Therefore, the actual formula is C6H4O2. So each carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon that had lost a hydrogen. So each of the two carbonyl carbons (positions 1 and 4) are part of the ring. Therefore, position 1 is C=O and is adjacent to positions 2 and 6, each of which may have a hydrogen. But in the benzene ring, each carbon has one H. However, if adjacent to the carbonyl, oxygen's double bond might take the carbon into a different state.

Wait, in the quinone structure, the adjacent carbons (alpha to the carbonyl) could still have hydrogens. Here's the confusion: the elimination of H from the benzene ring when replacing CH with CO would mean that the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the CO) still may have H's.

Wait, no: When you have a benzene ring (all carbons sp² hybridized, each with one H), if two of the CH groups are oxidized to C=O, the adjacent carbons would be part of the conjugated system, but each of the adjacent C's might still have an H. For instance, in 1,4-benzoquinone, carbonyls at positions 1 and 4. Then, positions 2 and 6 (next to 1) will have carbons connected to the ring. These carbons are sp² hybridized, each with one H (as in benzene), and they form conjugated double bonds.

Thus, those adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6) each have a hydrogen. So would that hydrogen be alpha to the carbonyl? Yes. Wait, alpha is usually the carbon next to the carbonyl (like C-2 next to the carbonyl at C-1 as alpha). So if the CO is at C-1, then C-2 is the alpha carbon. So if C-2 has a hydrogen (like in benzoquinone), then maybe benzoquinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are part of an aromatic system, which is quite stable. The enol form would disrupt the aromaticity. Alternatively, the presence of multiple conjugated rings might stabilize an enol form. But in typical cases, I think benzoquinones don't exhibit keto-enol tautomerism because oxidation to the quinone state removes the necessary protons or stabilizes the keto form so much that the enol is not favored.

Wait, but if there are alpha hydrogens available, why wouldn't it tautomerize? Maybe the problem here is that while there are alpha hydrogens, the tautomer (enol form) would require converting the quinone structure into a non-aromatic system, which is not energetically favorable. So benzoquinone exists only in the keto form, as the enol form would disrupt the conjugated ring system, losing aromatic stability. Whereas, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, being a non-aromatic compound, can undergo tautomerism more readily. Let me verify. Considering that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is more strained and seeks any stabilization, converting to enol might not necessarily disrupt such a structure, but in fact, allow for conjugation through the ring. Alternatively, since the trione has three carbonyl groups, they can form conjugated enol structures. For example, each hydroxyl group in the enol form could form hydrogen bonds with adjacent carbonyl groups, stabilizing the enol form. However, in reality, the triketone (cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) could have enolization involving adjacent carbonyl groups, so each enol could bridge between two ketones. For the trione, it might form three conjugated enol structures, or one enol structure.

Alternatively, consider that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione actually exists in a fully enolized form to gain aromatic stabilization. But wait, the fully enol form would create alternating single and double bonds around the ring, making it aromatic. For example, if each ketone group converts to an enol (-OH and double bond), then we could imagine a structure where the cyclohexane ring is triply enolized, leading to an aromatic system. However, benzene is already aromatic with six π electrons, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, if fully enolized, could that form a similar six-membered ring with three double bonds (contributing six π electrons).

Wait, if each of the three enol groups creates one double bond (from O-H to O, forming a conjugated system), perhaps the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would enolize to a trihydroxy benzene derivative? But if keto-enol tautomerism happens, each ketone would convert to an enol; so three enol groups could lead to a triol with conjugated double bonds. But would that structure have aromatic stability? If the resulting enol form has three double bonds in conjugation, perhaps even allowing for aromatic resonance, thus stabilizing the enol form. That might make the enol form as stable as benzene triol (phloroglucinol?), which is known. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione could readily tautomerize into an enol form (possibly phloroglucinol), which is aromatic, hence stabilizing the enol form. So if the enol form is aromatic, then that tautomer would be more stable. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would show tautomerism (exist as enol form more). But benzoquinone, already an oxidized form of benzene, in which the keto form is the stabilized quinone structure, which isn't aromatic in total (as benzene's perfect conjugation), but the double bonds might not be conjugated. Wait, benzoquinone has conjugated double bonds between the carbonyl and the ring. The para-quinone structure is conjugated but not aromatic. Unless aromatic here in quinone allows for a different conjugation. Alternatively, it's known that quinones are conjugated dienones, and they do not have aromatic stabilization of benzene. So if cyclohexanetrione can enolize to form an aromatic triol, which phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) is, which is phenolic and aromatic, then the enol form is stabilized by aromaticity. In that case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would undergo tautomerism and likely exist mainly in the enol form. Thus, benzoquinone (which is already in a conjugated structure but not aromatic like benzene) can't form an enol that has aromatic stabilization, thus remains in the keto form, hence cannot undergo tautomerism.

Wait, quinones are conjugated systems with two ketone groups, but the stability comes from conjugation of double bonds between the rings and ketones, but they don't have aromatic stabilization. So in benzoquinone, maybe there are alpha hydrogens, but tautomerism would result in the enol, but this enol form is less stable because it does not increase aromaticity. Therefore, the enol form would just be a lone phenol derivative but not aromatic, which makes it non-viable. Whereas, in the case of cyclohexanetrione, the enol form would gain aromaticity (producing a structure similar to 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene which is aromatic). Wait, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene does exist, called phloroglucinol, and is known to form a conjugated, aromatic triol. But does cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione exist as its trienol tautomer (i.e., phloroglucinol in keto form)? That could be the case. Thus, the cyclohexanetrione would tautomerize to phloroglucinol (the enol form) which is aromatic, making trione keto but less stable than the triol enol. Therefore, cyclohexanetrione does show tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can form enols between adjacent carbonyl groups, but does that lead to an aromatic system?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. If each undergoes enolization, that would lead to three double bonds. But completely conjugating them in a six-membered ring to get three double bonds (like benzene) would give aromaticity. For aromaticity, the compound must have a planar ring with continuous overlap of p-orbitals and (4n + 2) π electrons. Benzene has 6 (Huckel's rule), n=1. If the cyclohexanetrione in the tautomer form has three conjugated double bonds (each from enolization), then there would be six π electrons (3 double bonds × 2 = 6 electrons), so fulfilling Huckel's rule. Therefore, such a tautomer would be aromatic. Hence, the cyclohexanetrione would be more stable in the enol form (phloroglucinol derivative), which is aromatic, so it shows tautomerism.

Therefore, between benzoquinone and cyclohexanetrione, benzoquinone does NOT show tautomerism (since the enol form isn't favorable, possibly disrupting conjugation without gaining aromaticity) while cyclohexanetrione does show tautomerism because enol form is aromatic. So answer A would be benzoquinone.

Now moving on to part B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate vs dimethyl fumarate. Which shows optical isomerism?

First, understanding optical isomerism: it's a type of stereoisomerism where molecules are non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). For that, the molecule must have a chiral center (carbon with four different substituents) or another form of chirality, like a biphenyl with restricted rotation. 

Dimethyl fumarate: fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioate. Structure should be HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. But when it's dimethyl, the OMe groups are on the end COO. So structure is CH3O-CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3. With the double bond in trans (E) configuration. So dimethyl fumarate's structure is trans-diesters of maleic acid. The molecule has a trans double bond. Now, dimethyl fumarate, is the molecule planar with that double bond. Are there any chiral centers?

Looking at the carbons. Both ester groups (OCH3) are on either end. The carbon chain is OCH2C-CH=CH-CO-OCH3? Wait no. Let's write the structure properly. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, fumarate is Trans HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Then the dimethyl ester would be CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the double bond in trans. Therefore, each of the two carbons in the double bond are each connected to COOCH3 and H. Wait, no: the structure HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Upon esterification, it becomes (CH3O)OC-CH=CH-COO(CH3). The double bond is between the two CH groups. Each of those carbons in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and a hydrogen. Wait, wait: in fumarate (the trans form), the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides. So, for dimethyl fumarate, comparing the structure, you have:

O
||
O-C-CH_Arranged so that the double bond E-configuration (trans). So each double bond carbons is connected to H and COOCH3. So carbon A: COOCH3 and H; carbon B: COOCH3 and H. Wait, Hmmm.

Wait, in fumarate, the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides. So dimethyl fumarate would have E configuration: the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. The molecule as a whole is symmetrical? If both COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, then each end is the same. In such a case, perhaps there's a plane or center of symmetry. Let me see structurally. If the molecule is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2, then may not be a chiral center. Wait, but there’s a double bond. The molecule may not have any tetrahedral stereocenters, but the double bond is stereogenic (E vs Z). However, optical isomerism requires chiral centers, whereas the trans vs cis here is geometric isomerism (which is different from optical).

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate has geometric isomerism (due to the double bond's configuration) but since the molecule is symmetrical, changing the configuration won't produce an enantiomer; you only get E and Z isomers which are diastereomers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn’t have optical activity because there's no chiral center.

Now look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure: propanoate is CH2-COO-… Wait. Specifically, 2-hydroxypropanoate is O

Looking up: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid (CH3-CH(OH)-COOH). The methyl ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. 

So, the structure is as follows: the central carbon (C2) is attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carboxylate group (COOCH3), and another hydrogen (from propanoate). But wait, that seems not enough. Let's check. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Wait: the numbering is 1, 2, 3. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? Wait, perhaps another way.

No, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Then the esterification would replace the -COOH's OH with OCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, so looking at the central carbon (carbon 2 of the original propanoate), this carbon is connected to: a hydroxyl (OH), a methyl group (CH3), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. Wait: combining that, carbon 2 would have four different substituents: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Hence, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can exist as two enantiomers (R and S configurations). Therefore, it would show optical isomerism. 

However, need to confirm if that carbon is indeed a chiral center. Let me list the substituents again at carbon two (the hydroxy-bearing carbon):

Adjacent positions: carbon 1 (from the original numbering) would be a CH3 group. Then the 2nd carbon: -OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H.

Wait, depending on how the ester is formed. If 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. To form the methyl ester, the COOH becomes COOCH3. So structure: CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

But in this structure, the central carbon (where the hydroxyl is attached) is connected to: 
1. Methyl group (from adjacent carbon -CH3)
2. Hydroxyl group (-OH)
3. Carbonyl group (-COOCH3)
4. Hydrogen (H-)
So yes, this is four different substituents. Therefore, a chiral center exists. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has optical isomerism (enantiomers). 

So answer B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. 

Therefore, concluding:

A (compound without tautomerism): benzoquinone

B (compound with optical isomerism): methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

**Final Answer**

The compound that does not show tautomerism is \boxed{benzoquinone}, and the compound that shows optical isomerism is \boxed{methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate}.

Okay, so I need to figure out two things here: first, which compound doesn't show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and second, whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. Let me start with the first part.

For keto-enol tautomerism, the enol form requires an adjacent alcohol group (enol) next to a carbonyl. So, if the compound doesn’t have an alpha hydrogen (hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl), it can't undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Similarly, other types of tautomerism, like lactam-lactim, etc., might require specific groups.

So we need to check if benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens. 

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each carbonyl group is on the cyclohexane ring. Let's visualize this: a six-membered ring with ketones at positions 1, 3, 5. So each of those carbons is a carbonyl. The carbons adjacent to each carbonyl would be the ring carbons next to each ketone. For example, carbon 2 is next to ketone at 1 and 3, and so on. Wait, let me see structurally. If each ketone is on the cyclohexane, the positions between them (like 2,4,6) might have CH2 groups. Wait, no. If it's cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, then each of these positions (1,3,5) is a carbonyl (O=C-). So the ring is probably in a chair-like structure, but with three carbonyl oxygens. Each carbonyl group (C=O) is connected to three different positions. Let's think in a planar structure. So positions 1,3,5 each have a C=O, connected to the ring. Then, the adjacent carbons (2, 4, 6) would each be next to two ketone groups. For example, carbon 2 is adjacent to position 1 and position 3 ketones. But each of those neighboring carbonyl carbons would be part of the ring. So, does cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have alpha hydrogens? The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl would need to have at least one hydrogen atom. Wait, if each ketone is on the cyclohexane, then the adjacent carbons must be CH2 or CH groups. But in this trione compound, each ketone is bonded to a carbon that is part of the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, for example, for cyclohexane (a six-membered ring with all single bonds), substituting positions 1,3,5 with ketones, so we'd have three carbonyl groups. Each of the ketone carbons (positions 1, 3, 5) are connected to the ring carbons. Then, the adjacent carbons (for ketone 1: carbons 6 and 2) might each have two hydrogens. Wait, if the cyclohexane is fully single-bonded, then those adjacent carbons would have two hydrogens each. But wait, if there are ketone groups at positions 1, 3, 5 replacing the CH2 groups, then those would be C=O instead. But now, the carbons adjacent to the ketone (positions 6 and 2 from position 1) would form the cyclohexane ring. So that is each of the adjacent positions would have two CH2 groups (if on cyclohexane). But actually, let me get this straight: suppose something like cyclohexane, but where at positions 1,3,5, they have ketone groups. So in each of positions 1,3,5, their structure is C=O instead of CH2. Then the ring would have alternating single bonds (because cyclic), but the carbonyls are at those positions. Then, the adjacent carbons (say, next to 1) would be positions 2 and 6 (both CH2 groups?), but in a cyclohexanetrione, possibly the carbonyl groups are in such a way that adjacent positions are part of the ring. But regardless, I need to figure out whether the adjacent carbons have hydrogens. If the carbons next to each ketone (the alpha carbons) have H atoms, then the compound can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. For cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, after substituting three CH2 groups with C=O, the adjacent carbons would be CH2 (between ketones), so those carbons (positions 2,4,6) would each have two H's. Therefore, each has alpha hydrogens. Therefore, they could potentially undergo tautomerism. If each has alpha hydrogens, which they do (each adjacent C is CH2), then they can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone, though, may not have alpha hydrogens. Because in the cyclohexane ring with ketone group, each ketone is at a position where the adjacent carbons are part of the conjugated ring. Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at para positions. But in benzene, each carbon is part of the conjugated double bonds. If those double bonds are fixed in the quinone structure. For example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons to the carbonyls (positions 2 and 6, adjacent to position 1 and 3,5 adjacent to position 4) would be in conjugation. However, maybe those adjacent carbons don't actually have any hydrogen. Because in benzene (C6H6), each carbon has one H. But when converting it to benzoquinone, which two carbons are involved?

Wait, benzoquinone is derived from benzene by replacing two CH groups with carbonyl groups. Therefore, the actual formula is C6H4O2. So each carbonyl is attached to a benzene carbon that had lost a hydrogen. So each of the two carbonyl carbons (positions 1 and 4) are part of the ring. Therefore, position 1 is C=O and is adjacent to positions 2 and 6, each of which may have a hydrogen. But in the benzene ring, each carbon has one H. However, if adjacent to the carbonyl, oxygen's double bond might take the carbon into a different state.

Wait, in the quinone structure, the adjacent carbons (alpha to the carbonyl) could still have hydrogens. Here's the confusion: the elimination of H from the benzene ring when replacing CH with CO would mean that the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the CO) still may have H's.

Wait, no: When you have a benzene ring (all carbons sp² hybridized, each with one H), if two of the CH groups are oxidized to C=O, the adjacent carbons would be part of the conjugated system, but each of the adjacent C's might still have an H. For instance, in 1,4-benzoquinone, carbonyls at positions 1 and 4. Then, positions 2 and 6 (next to 1) will have carbons connected to the ring. These carbons are sp² hybridized, each with one H (as in benzene), and they form conjugated double bonds.

Thus, those adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6) each have a hydrogen. So would that hydrogen be alpha to the carbonyl? Yes. Wait, alpha is usually the carbon next to the carbonyl (like C-2 next to the carbonyl at C-1 as alpha). So if the CO is at C-1, then C-2 is the alpha carbon. So if C-2 has a hydrogen (like in benzoquinone), then maybe benzoquinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are part of an aromatic system, which is quite stable. The enol form would disrupt the aromaticity. Alternatively, the presence of multiple conjugated rings might stabilize an enol form. But in typical cases, I think benzoquinones don't exhibit keto-enol tautomerism because oxidation to the quinone state removes the necessary protons or stabilizes the keto form so much that the enol is not favored.

Wait, but if there are alpha hydrogens available, why wouldn't it tautomerize? Maybe the problem here

# Anthropic completion

Let me rephrase my thought process about determining which compound doesn't exhibit tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

To understand tautomerism, particularly keto-enol tautomerism, we need a compound with a carbonyl group and a hydrogen atom on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (alpha position). This allows the hydrogen to migrate to the oxygen, creating an enol structure.

Looking at benzoquinone first, it's derived from benzene by replacing two CH groups with carbonyl groups at para positions (1,4). The structure has a conjugated system where carbons adjacent to the carbonyls (positions 2,3,5,6) each retain one hydrogen from the original benzene structure. These hydrogens are technically alpha to the carbonyl groups. However, benzoquinone's conjugated system is highly stable, and the formation of an enol would disrupt this stability. The aromatic character and conjugation make the keto form strongly preferred, effectively preventing tautomerism.

For cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, we have a six-membered ring with ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons between the ketones (positions 2, 4, and 6) are CH2 groups, meaning each has two hydrogens. These hydrogens are alpha to the adjacent carbonyl groups. Since these are simple ketone groups on a saturated ring, and each adjacent carbon has available hydrogens, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can readily undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Therefore, benzoquinone must be the compound that doesn't show tautomerism, despite having alpha hydrogens, because its conjugated structure strongly favors the keto form.

Now, regarding optical isomerism in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate versus dimethyl fumarate...

# OpenAI completion

Certainly! Here's the rephrased text:

I need to sort out two issues: first, identifying which compound doesn't exhibit tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and second, determining if either methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate displays optical isomerism. Let’s tackle the first issue.

Tautomerism occurs when a compound can interconvert between different structural isomers through a chemical reaction, typically involving proton movement and double bond rearrangement. The most well-known type is keto-enol tautomerism. For this to happen, the compound must have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester) and a hydrogen atom adjacent to it (an alpha hydrogen), which allows the hydrogen to transfer to the oxygen in the carbonyl, forming an enol.

Benzoquinone consists of two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Visualize its structure: a benzene ring with two double-bonded oxygens on opposite carbons (para positions). Given that all ring carbons either participate in the aromatic ring or are double-bonded to oxygen, alpha hydrogens might not be present. Both ketones are at para positions—at 1 and 4—on benzene. In this context, adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. Contemplate: in benzoquinone, each ketone group is on the quinone structure, resulting in two C=O groups. 

Analyzing the alpha carbons (next to the carbonyls), they are within the aromatic system. Specifically looking at 1,4-benzoquinone, it has an O=C6H4=C=O structure at the para positions, and each carbonyl is outside the ring, ensuring no alpha hydrogens exist due to the conjugation of carbonyls with the aromatic system. Should the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls (alpha carbons) lack hydrogen atoms, tautomerism is unachievable. 

Next, consider cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione with ketones at positions 1, 3, and 5 on the cyclohexane ring. Visualize this: a six-membered ring with ketones at those positions implies CH2 or CH groups between them, and they possess alpha hydrogens allowing tautomerism. However, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is double-bonded to oxygen at alternating positions in the ring, thus lacking alpha hydrogens, which means it cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, only cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has the potential for tautomerism.

On reflecting further, the bonding and aromatic nature of benzoquinone stabilize its keto form to the extent that the enol form is not prevalent, leading typically to the conclusion that benzoquinones do not undergo tautomerism, irrespective of available alpha hydrogens, due to the disruption of aromaticity in such a transition.

For example, the enol form would break the conjugation of the quinone structure, leading to a non-aromatic structure which is highly unstable. Therefore, even if the alpha hydrogens are present, the driving force towards aromatic (quinone) structure is so strong that tautomerism is not observed. Alternatively, maybe the alpha hydrogen is not present. Wait, for a beta-diketone, you can have enol tautomerism because alpha hydrogens can form a conjugated enol. But benzoquinone is a para-diquinone. Alternatively, maybe in benzoquinone, there are two carbonyl groups with a conjugated system, making it stable, but the enol form is not as stable. Let me cross-check by looking at typical examples. For instance, cyclohexanedione (like 1,4-cyclohexanedione) can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But benzoquinone, on the other hand, due to aromatic stabilization, doesn't enolize. Thus, the correct answer is that benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. But why? If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups each adjacent to CH2 groups (alpha carbons with H's), then all three could potentially participate in tautomerism. So in that case, cyclohexane-trone would tautomerize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the presence of three carbonyl groups in conjugation could stabilize the enol form through resonance. But if between the three ketones the enol can form rings (like conjugated enol structures), making it more favorable. Conversely, benzoquinone is aromatic, so it's more stable as the keto form (quinone), so tautomerism is disfavored. Therefore, benzoquinone (A) doesn't show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-trione does. So (A) is benzoquinone.\n\nNow, moving to part B: which between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. \n\nOptical isomerism, or enantiomerism, occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (asymmetric carbon) or some other form of chirality (like a plane or axis). A chiral center is a carbon attached to four different substituents. \n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be CH3-C(OH)-COOH. The ester would replace the COOH with COOCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Let me write that step by step. Propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon. So after esterification, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, but wait, that can't be. No: Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy version would have the hydroxyl on the alpha carbon (second carbon), so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But actually, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid: structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Esterified with methanol would give methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So looks like the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So in this compound, the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to: methyl (CH3), hydroxyl (OH), carbonyl (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. So the central carbon has groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Are all four groups different? Let's check: COOCH3 is a different group than the others? Yes. The COOCH3 is an ester group. Then, the groups adjacent to the chiral carbon (central carbon) would be: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. All four groups are different. Therefore, this creates a chiral center, which gives rise to optical isomerism (enantiomers). So this molecule would show optical isomerism.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is similar to methyl lactate. Lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) has a chiral center. So if the ester is made from methyl alcohol and the acid, then the ester (methyl lactate) should retain the chiral center. Yes. So the answer would be optical isomerism for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nOn the other hand, dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid). Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with trans double bond. So fumaric acid is trans HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Esterification at both carboxylic acid groups with methyl groups would make dimethyl fumarate: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers or other elements of chirality? Let's look at the structure. The central part is CH=CH with two ester groups. The double bond is trans, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Each carbon in the double bond (the two CH groups) are each connected to two oxygen ester groups. Wait, no: for fumarate, it's trans, so the ester groups would be on opposite sides of the double bond. Each ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The carbons in the double bond (each sp² hybridized) would be connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 (but in fumarate, it's more like HC=CH with COOCH3 groups in trans). Wait, another possibility: the actual structure of fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the double bond being trans. The ester would replace the H in the COOH groups with methyl, so OCH3.\n\nSo dimethyl fumarate is (CH3OOC)CH=CH(COOCH3), with trans configuration. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? The double bond itself might cause geometric isomerism (cis/trans, which is a type of stereoisomerism but not optical isomerism), but optical isomerism requires chiral centers or other chirality elements. In this case, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical groups: each is connected to a COOCH3 and to a CH (then the double bond). So for each of the central carbons (the two in the double bond), their substituents are COOCH3, COOCH3 (if they are arranged symmetrically). Wait, no. The structure is: CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 and HC=CH. Wait, perhaps better to write it as OCOCH3-CH=CH-OCOCH3, but with the OCOCH3 groups on opposite ends (since fumarate is the trans isomer). So each carbon in the double bond is attached to one OCOCH3 and one H? Wait, maybe not. Let's clarify. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? But no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, trans configuration. Then, the diester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, trans. So each carbon in the double bond (left and right) is attached to a COOCH3 group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon in the double bond. So, left CH is connected to COOCH3, double bond (to the right CH), and a hydrogen. Right CH is connected to COOCH3, double bond (to the left CH), and a hydrogen. But due to the double bond being trans, both COOCH3 groups are opposite each other. But both carbons in the double bond each have one COOCH3, one H, and two C=C bonds. The two substituents (COOCH3 and H) on each carbon are in a trans configuration. Now, does either of those carbons have four different groups? Let's see.\n\nThe left carbon in the double bond is attached to: COOCH3, H, double bond to right carbon, and single bond to the next carbon (which is part of the double bond as sp²). Wait, the left carbon is connected to COOCH3, H, and two carbons (the double bond and adjacent carbon). But wait, maybe we need to count all substituent groups. The left CH is bonded to: COOCH3, two CH groups (via the double bond and single bond?), hmm. No. Each carbon of the double bond (the two central carbons in dimethyl fumarate) have the following substituents: For the left carbon: one group is the COOCH3, another is the double bond (to the right carbon), and the others? If it's a CH group, then holding a hydrogen. Wait, perhaps the correct substituents are COOCH3, H, C (double bond to right CH), and C (connecting to another carbon in the chain). Wait, if the molecule is OCOCH3-CH=CH-OCOCH3, each CH in the double bond is attached to:  1) OCOCH3, 2) H, 3) the other CH group via the double bond, and 4) a single bond to adjacent carbon? No, in this molecule, after the carbonyl group, it's just -(CH=CH)-.\n\nWait, maybe the full structure is:\n\nLeft: OCOCH3-CH \nMiddle: CH=CH  \nRight: CH-OCOCH3, so actually, is there a chain of OCOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCOCH3 but with a double bond instead of single? No. Actual structure would be: OCOCH2-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me start again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, trans. So when converted to dimethyl ester, it's CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the two ester groups on opposite sides (trans). The central two carbons (CH=CH) each have the following substituents: For each CH carbon in the double bond: on one side, COOCH3; on the other, H. But since it's trans, the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. However, neither of these CH groups in the double bond has four different substituents. Each CH is attached to: COOCH3, H, double-bonded to another CH (which is attached to COOCH3 and H), and the other single bond? Wait, no. Each CH in the double bond is connected to COOCH3, H, and two carbons via double and single bonds? No. Let me write out the structure properly.\n\nThe structure of dimethyl fumarate is:\n\n      O\n      ||\nCH3O-C-O-CH2-CH2-O-C-OCH3 \n      ||           ||\n      O           O\n\nWait, no, that's the structure of something else. No, fumarate is the trans-diesters of butenedioic acid. So butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, trans. So replacing the H of the carboxylic acid groups with methyl groups gives dimethyl fumarate: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester oxygens are on opposite sides of the double bond.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\n- a carbon chain as CH=CH\n\n- each end of the chain is connected to a OCOOCH3 group.\n\nEach CH in the double bond is attached to:\n\n- one OCOOCH3 group,\n\n- one H atom,\n\n- and the other CH group (double bond), and one single bond.\n\nWait, but the two central carbons (the CH=CH) each have two substituents from the double bond. Wait, each CH is part of the double bond, so their substituents would be:\n\nEach CH in the double bond:\n\nleft CH: attached to OCOOCH3 (on one side), then a double bond to the right CH, and two other substituents?\n\nWait, no. The structure of fumarate:\n\nCentral double bond CH=CH. Each CH group in the double bond is also attached to a COOCH3 group. So each CH is bonded to three groups: COOCH3, H, and the other CH (double bond). Wait, that can't be. Wait, every carbon in the double bond must have three substituents. In this case, each CH in the CH=CH has:\n\nRight and left to carbonyl groups?\n\nWait, perhaps the actual structure is OCOCH2-CH=CH-COOCH3, but that doesn't account for the trans orientation. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:\n\nLeft: OCOCH2-CH2, but that would not include a double bond. Confusion arises because maybe I should just accept that for the CH=CH in dimethyl fumarate, each CH is attached to a COOCH3 group and one H. Since it's trans, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides.\n\nGiven that, each central carbon has the substituents: COOCH3, H, and a double bond. So two substituents are same (COOCH3 and H), plus the double bond. No, each has three substituents? Wait, no. Each carbon has a double bond (which counts as two substituents), but within that double bond. Let me get back to the basics. The two central carbons are each bonded via a double bond. Each of them is also bonded to a COOCH3 group and an H. Thus, substituents around them: For each CH:\n\n- COOCH3,\n\n- H,\n\n- and the other carbon via double bond.\n\nWait, but the double bond would mean two substituents (from each carbon's perspective). No, depending on how you draw it, each carbon in a double bond has three substituents. The double bond between carbons C1 and C2 implies that each is sp² hybridized and has three sigma bonds. Hence, each of these carbons (Cl and Cr) would be bonded to:\n\nFor C1: COOCH3, H, and Cr (double bond plus possibly others?)\n\nWait, perhaps each vinyl group is adjacent only to carbonyl groups. Let me check the structure again. In fumaric acid, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Esterified to dimethyl fumarate: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, with the double bond in the trans configuration. So for the CH=CH group, each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group, an H, and the adjacent CH. However, since the molecule is trans, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. But as for substituents on each CH in the double bond, they have:\n\nLeft CH: COOCH3 (left), CH (right, double bond), and H.\n\nSimilarly, Right CH: COOCH3 (right), CH (left, double bond), and H.\n\nWait, but each carbon in the double bond is connected to a carbonyl group (say, OCOOCH3), another H, and a double bond.\n\nThus, the four groups attached to each CH would be: For each CH:\n\n1. OCOOCH3 (oxygen-containing group)\n\n2. H\n\n3. C (double bond)\n\nHere arises a problem. Each carbon in the double bond (Cl and Cr) has three substituents, but for a carbon to be a chiral center, it must be bonded to four different groups. So in dimethyl fumarate, each of the central carbons (in the double bond) is attached to three groups (OCOOCH3, H, C=C). So perhaps they each have three substituents, making them not a chiral center. Thus, this compound doesn't have a chiral center and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. \n\nAlternatively, if there are any other chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate: let's confirm. The ester groups (OCOOCH3) are symmetric around the double bond. Each CH in the double bond is attached to an OCOOCH3, an H, and two carbons from the double bond? If those are considered substituents, but since the double bond's two carbons are bonded to each other via a double bond, which may not count as separate substituents interacting there. If each central CH has three unique groups (OCOOCH3, H, and the adjacent CH group =C-), but considering the double bond as part of the same substituent, then each CH would have three substituents. If so, there's no quartet substituents to make a chiral center. Alternatively, sometimes the adjacent carbon-substituent is actually considered. But we don't have four substituents. So dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers, thus no optical activity. Hence, it's only capable of geometric isomerism (cis vs. trans), but fumarate itself is the trans form, so that dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester, not a cis dieSter. Since they don't have chiral centers, no optical isomerism. \n\nHowever, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a central carbon (chiral center) with four different groups: OH, COOCH3, CH3, and H. Hence, it should show optical isomerism. Therefore, the answer (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. \n\nSo final answers: (A) benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism, (B) methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.\n\n**Final Answer**\nA is \\boxed{benzoquinone} and B is \\boxed{methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate}.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1741218254, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4203, prompt_tokens=2977, total_tokens=7180, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine which compound does not show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B), we analyze the given compounds as follows:

### Part A: Tautomerism
1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups in the para positions on a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons to the ketone groups are part of the aromatic ring, which is highly conjugated and stabilized. The delocalized electrons in the aromatic ring prevent the formation of the enol form, thus benzoquinone does not exhibit keto-enol tautomerism.
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons adjacent to each ketone (CH2 groups) have alpha hydrogens, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, this compound can tautomerize.

**Conclusion for Part A**: Benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Optical Isomerism
1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound has a chiral center at the second carbon (the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group). The groups attached to this carbon are a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (CH3), a methoxycarbonyl group (COOCH3), and a hydrogen atom (H). Since all four groups are different, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.
2. **Dimethyl Fumarate**: This compound is the trans isomer of dimethyl butenedioate. The double bond in fumarate is in a trans configuration, which does not create any chiral centers. The molecule lacks a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

### Final Answer
A is \boxed{benzoquinone} and B is \boxed{methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 is that the enol form cannot resonance stabilize due to the existing conjugated system. For example, the enol form would break the conjugation of the quinone structure, leading to a non-aromatic structure which is highly unstable. Therefore, even if the alpha hydrogens are present, the driving force towards aromatic (quinone) structure is so strong that tautomerism is not observed. Alternatively, maybe the alpha hydrogen is not present. Wait, for a beta-diketone, you can have enol tautomerism because alpha hydrogens can form a conjugated enol. But benzoquinone is a para-diquinone. Alternatively, maybe in benzoquinone, there are two carbonyl groups with a conjugated system, making it stable, but the enol form is not as stable. Let me cross-check by looking at typical examples. For instance, cyclohexanedione (like 1,4-cyclohexanedione) can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. But benzoquinone, on the other hand, due to aromatic stabilization, doesn't enolize. Thus, the correct answer is that benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. But why? If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups each adjacent to CH2 groups (alpha carbons with H's), then all three could potentially participate in tautomerism. So in that case, cyclohexane-trone would tautomerize.

Alternatively, maybe in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the presence of three carbonyl groups in conjugation could stabilize the enol form through resonance. But if between the three ketones the enol can form rings (like conjugated enol structures), making it more favorable. Conversely, benzoquinone is aromatic, so it's more stable as the keto form (quinone), so tautomerism is disfavored. Therefore, benzoquinone (A) doesn't show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-trione does. So (A) is benzoquinone.

Now, moving to part B: which between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism. 

Optical isomerism, or enantiomerism, occurs when a molecule has a chiral center (asymmetric carbon) or some other form of chirality (like a plane or axis). A chiral center is a carbon attached to four different substituents. 

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is the methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be CH3-C(OH)-COOH. The ester would replace the COOH with COOCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Let me write that step by step. Propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon. So after esterification, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, but wait, that can't be. No: Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy version would have the hydroxyl on the alpha carbon (second carbon), so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. But actually, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid: structure is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Esterified with methanol would give methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So looks like the molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So in this compound, the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to: methyl (CH3), hydroxyl (OH), carbonyl (COOCH3), and a hydrogen. So the central carbon has groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Are all four groups different? Let's check: COOCH3 is a different group than the others? Yes. The COOCH3 is an ester group. Then, the groups adjacent to the chiral carbon (central carbon) would be: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. All four groups are different. Therefore, this creates a chiral center, which gives rise to optical isomerism (enantiomers). So this molecule would show optical isomerism.

But wait, let me confirm. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is similar to methyl lactate. Lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) has a chiral center. So if the ester is made from methyl alcohol and the acid, then the ester (methyl lactate) should retain the chiral center. Yes. So the answer would be optical isomerism for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid). Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with trans double bond. So fumaric acid is trans HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Esterification at both carboxylic acid groups with methyl groups would make dimethyl fumarate: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Now, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers or other elements of chirality? Let's look at the structure. The central part is CH=CH with two ester groups. The double bond is trans, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Each carbon in the double bond (the two CH groups) are each connected to two oxygen ester groups. Wait, no: for fumarate, it's trans, so the ester groups would be on opposite sides of the double bond. Each ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The carbons in the double bond (each sp² hybridized) would be connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 (but in fumarate, it's more like HC=CH with COOCH3 groups in trans). Wait, another possibility: the actual structure of fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the double bond being trans. The ester would replace the H in the COOH groups with methyl, so OCH3.

So dimethyl fumarate is (CH3OOC)CH=CH(COOCH3), with trans configuration. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? The double bond itself might cause geometric isomerism (cis/trans, which is a type of stereoisomerism but not optical isomerism), but optical isomerism requires chiral centers or other chirality elements. In this case, each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical groups: each is connected to a COOCH3 and to a CH (then the double bond). So for each of the central carbons (the two in the double bond), their substituents are COOCH3, COOCH3 (if they are arranged symmetrically). Wait, no. The structure is: CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 and HC=CH. Wait, perhaps better to write it as OCOCH3-CH=CH-OCOCH3, but with the OCOCH3 groups on opposite ends (since fumarate is the trans isomer). So each carbon in the double bond is attached to one OCOCH3 and one H? Wait, maybe not. Let's clarify. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? But no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, trans configuration. Then, the diester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, trans. So each carbon in the double bond (left and right) is attached to a COOCH3 group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon in the double bond. So, left CH is connected to COOCH3, double bond (to the right CH), and a hydrogen. Right CH is connected to COOCH3, double bond (to the left CH), and a hydrogen. But due to the double bond being trans, both COOCH3 groups are opposite each other. But both carbons in the double bond each have one COOCH3, one H, and two C=C bonds. The two substituents (COOCH3 and H) on each carbon are in a trans configuration. Now, does either of those carbons have four different groups? Let's see.

The left carbon in the double bond is attached to: COOCH3, H, double bond to right carbon, and single bond to the next carbon (which is part of the double bond as sp²). Wait, the left carbon is connected to COOCH3, H, and two carbons (the double bond and adjacent carbon). But wait, maybe we need to count all substituent groups. The left CH is bonded to: COOCH3, two CH groups (via the double bond and single bond?), hmm. No. Each carbon of the double bond (the two central carbons in dimethyl fumarate) have the following substituents: For the left carbon: one group is the COOCH3, another is the double bond (to the right carbon), and the others? If it's a CH group, then holding a hydrogen. Wait, perhaps the correct substituents are COOCH3, H, C (double bond to right CH), and C (connecting to another carbon in the chain). Wait, if the molecule is OCOCH3-CH=CH-OCOCH3, each CH in the double bond is attached to:  1) OCOCH3, 2) H, 3) the other CH group via the double bond, and 4) a single bond to adjacent carbon? No, in this molecule, after the carbonyl group, it's just -(CH=CH)-.

Wait, maybe the full structure is:

Left: OCOCH3-CH 
Middle: CH=CH  
Right: CH-OCOCH3, so actually, is there a chain of OCOCH3-CH2-CH2-OCOCH3 but with a double bond instead of single? No. Actual structure would be: OCOCH2-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me start again. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, trans. So when converted to dimethyl ester, it's CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the two ester groups on opposite sides (trans). The central two carbons (CH=CH) each have the following substituents: For each CH carbon in the double bond: on one side, COOCH3; on the other, H. But since it's trans, the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. However, neither of these CH groups in the double bond has four different substituents. Each CH is attached to: COOCH3, H, double-bonded to another CH (which is attached to COOCH3 and H), and the other single bond? Wait, no. Each CH in the double bond is connected to COOCH3, H, and two carbons via double and single bonds? No. Let me write out the structure properly.

The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

      O
      ||
CH3O-C-O-CH2-CH2-O-C-OCH3 
      ||           ||
      O           O

Wait, no, that's the structure of something else. No, fumarate is the trans-diesters of butenedioic acid. So butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, trans. So replacing the H of the carboxylic acid groups with methyl groups gives dimethyl fumarate: CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3, where the two ester oxygens are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

- a carbon chain as CH=CH

- each end of the chain is connected to a OCOOCH3 group.

Each CH in the double bond is attached to:

- one OCOOCH3 group,

- one H atom,

- and the other CH group (double bond), and one single bond.

Wait, but the two central carbons (the CH=CH) each have two substituents from the double bond. Wait, each CH is part of the double bond, so their substituents would be:

Each CH in the double bond:

left CH: attached to OCOOCH3 (on one side), then a double bond to the right CH, and two other substituents?

Wait, no. The structure of fumarate:

Central double bond CH=CH. Each CH group in the double bond is also attached to a COOCH3 group. So each CH is bonded to three groups: COOCH3, H, and the other CH (double bond). Wait, that can't be. Wait, every carbon in the double bond must have three substituents. In this case, each CH in the CH=CH has:

Right and left to carbonyl groups?

Wait, perhaps the actual structure is OCOCH2-CH=CH-COOCH3, but that doesn't account for the trans orientation. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Left: OCOCH2-CH2, but that would not include a double bond. Confusion arises because maybe I should just accept that for the CH=CH in dimethyl fumarate, each CH is attached to a COOCH3 group and one H. Since it's trans, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides.

Given that, each central carbon has the substituents: COOCH3, H, and a double bond. So two substituents are same (COOCH3 and H), plus the double bond. No, each has three substituents? Wait, no. Each carbon has a double bond (which counts as two substituents), but within that double bond. Let me get back to the basics. The two central carbons are each bonded via a double bond. Each of them is also bonded to a COOCH3 group and an H. Thus, substituents around them: For each CH:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and the other carbon via double bond.

Wait, but the double bond would mean two substituents (from each carbon's perspective). No, depending on how you draw it, each carbon in a double bond has three substituents. The double bond between carbons C1 and C2 implies that each is sp² hybridized and has three sigma bonds. Hence, each of these carbons (Cl and Cr) would be bonded to:

For C1: COOCH3, H, and Cr (double bond plus possibly others?)

Wait, perhaps each vinyl group is adjacent only to carbonyl groups. Let me check the structure again. In fumaric acid, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Esterified to dimethyl fumarate: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, with the double bond in the trans configuration. So for the CH=CH group, each carbon in the double bond has a COOCH3 group, an H, and the adjacent CH. However, since the molecule is trans, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. But as for substituents on each CH in the double bond, they have:

Left CH: COOCH3 (left), CH (right, double bond), and H.

Similarly, Right CH: COOCH3 (right), CH (left, double bond), and H.

Wait, but each carbon in the double bond is connected to a carbonyl group (say, OCOOCH3), another H, and a double bond.

Thus, the four groups attached to each CH would be: For each CH:

1. OCOOCH3 (oxygen-containing group)

2. H

3. C (double bond)

Here arises a problem. Each carbon in the double bond (Cl and Cr) has three substituents, but for a carbon to be a chiral center, it must be bonded to four different groups. So in dimethyl fumarate, each of the central carbons (in the double bond) is attached to three groups (OCOOCH3, H, C=C). So perhaps they each have three substituents, making them not a chiral center. Thus, this compound doesn't have a chiral center and cannot exhibit optical isomerism. 

Alternatively, if there are any other chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate: let's confirm. The ester groups (OCOOCH3) are symmetric around the double bond. Each CH in the double bond is attached to an OCOOCH3, an H, and two carbons from the double bond? If those are considered substituents, but since the double bond's two carbons are bonded to each other via a double bond, which may not count as separate substituents interacting there. If each central CH has three unique groups (OCOOCH3, H, and the adjacent CH group =C-), but considering the double bond as part of the same substituent, then each CH would have three substituents. If so, there's no quartet substituents to make a chiral center. Alternatively, sometimes the adjacent carbon-substituent is actually considered. But we don't have four substituents. So dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers, thus no optical activity. Hence, it's only capable of geometric isomerism (cis vs. trans), but fumarate itself is the trans form, so that dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester, not a cis dieSter. Since they don't have chiral centers, no optical isomerism. 

However, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a central carbon (chiral center) with four different groups: OH, COOCH3, CH3, and H. Hence, it should show optical isomerism. Therefore, the answer (B) is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. 

So final answers: (A) benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism, (B) methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

**Final Answer**
A is \boxed{benzoquinone} and B is \boxed{methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate}.

Let's examine each compound.\n\nMethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the structure CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon in the propanoate chain) is attached to:\n\n1. A hydroxyl group (-OH),\n2. A methylene group (CH3COO- from the propanoate),\n3. A methoxy group (from the ester, COOCH3), and\n4. The remaining hydrogen.\n\nWait, maybe rearranging for clarity: The structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3 esterified with methyl. Wait, no - wait. Wait, propanoate is three carbons. The 2-hydroxypropanoate ester would be:\n\nStructure: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So structure would be: CH2(COOCH3)CH(OH)CH3? Hmm, no. Let me better visualize.\n\nActually, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. If you esterify the carboxylic acid group (the COOH) with a methyl group, you get methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. The central carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to:\n\n- an oxygen from the adjacent carbonyl group (as part of the ester),\n\nWait, no. Wait the ester is RCOOR', so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:\n\nPosition 1: COOCH3,\n\nPosition 2: -CH(OH)-,\n\nPosition 3: CH3.\n\nSo the molecule is:\n\nCOOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Wait, propanoate has three carbons. The carboxylic acid is the first carbon, the middle carbon is the 2nd. So lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Then, when you esterify the -COOH group to methyl, it becomes CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the hydroxy group is on the second carbon (the middle one). \n\nTherefore, the structure is: hydroxy (OH) attached to the central carbon (Carbon 2), connected to a methyl group (Carbon 3), and a COOCH3 group (Carbon 1). So now, Carbon 2 is bonded to:\n\n- One oxygen (hydroxy group), \n- Carbon 1 (COOCH3), \n- Carbon 3 (CH3), \n- And a hydrogen.\n\nWait, what are the substituents? Let's count Carbon 2 (the chiral center). The bonds are:\n\n1. -OH,\n2. -COOCH3,\n3. -CH3,\n4. -H.\n\nHence, the attached groups are: OH, COOCH3, CH3, and H. \n\nBut wait−I may be getting the structure wrong. If the original acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Lactic acid is correct as CH3-CHOH-COOH. So after esterification with methyl, it becomes CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Thus, the skeletal structure is CH2(OH)CH2CO-OCH3? Hmm, perhaps I should consider the actual formula. Let's get that straight.\n\nPropanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH. If we're discussing 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, that would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. Then, when esterified, methyl ester would replace the -OH of the COOH with OCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.\n\nSo the second carbon (from the COOCH3) is CH2(OH), next to the central CH2. Wait, perhaps this requires clearer analysis. Alternatively, maybe the compound is more accurately named based on substituents. Wait, hydroxy groups are named with the lowest possible numbering. Maybe 2-hydroxy would be:\n\nStructure: The propanoate ester is OCH3-O-C-CH2-CH2-OH. Hmm, perhaps not. To avoid confusion, maybe the correct structural formula is OCH2C(OH)CH2COOCH3 - no, perhaps a better approach is to research.\n\nWait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The parent is propanoic acid with the hydroxyl group on C-2. Therefore:\n\nCarbon 1: carboxylic acid (esterified to methyl) → COOCH3,\n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH),\n\nCarbon 3: the remaining CH3.\n\nSo the structure is: COOCH3 attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to a CH3.\n\nSo the central carbon (C2) has substituents: -OH, -COOCH3, -CH3, and another single bond. Wait, the central carbon? Let me imagine.\n\nLikely, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the following structure:\n\nThe central carbon (C) is bonded to:\n\n1. A hydroxyl group (-OH),\n\n2. A methyl group (-CH3),\n\n3. A carbonyl group (-COOCH3) attached to the adjacent carbon, but wait that's connected through a single bond. Wait.\n\nWait, another approach: Propanoate is three carbons. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. The structure should be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So in this case, the central carbon (second carbon) has:\n\n- A hydroxyl (-OH),\n\n- A methyl group (CH3 from the third carbon?), but third carbon is the COOCH3. Wait, second carbon is CH2. Wait, no:\n\nIf propanoate is CH2-COOCH3-CH2? No, maybe that's just wrong.\n\nHold on, perhaps an image would help, but since I can’t see that, let me try another approach.\n\nPropanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. If we have a hydroxy group on the second carbon (C2), then it would be CH3-CHOH-COOH. Then, esterifying the COOH group would replace the -OH with OCH3, making it CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So here, the hydroxy group is on C2. The structure around C2 would be:\n\n- CH3 (from C3, actually not directly substituent, but hangs indirect), wait.\n\nWait, no. Each carbon in the chain must be considered as substituents. The C2 is the central carbon — attached to:\n\n- C1 (COOCH3),\n\n- C3 (CH3),\n\n- two hydrogens,\n\nWait, but then again, lack a substituent. Wait, how's that possible? Maybe because I'm not correctly thinking through the structure.\n\nAlternative approach: structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:\n\nThe parent chain is three carbons, with the ester group on carbon 1 (COOCH3), alcohol hydroxyl on carbon 2, and methyl on carbon 3. Wait, but propanoate would only have three carbons in total.\n\nAlternatively, would it not be?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the confusion comes from different numbering. Let me completely map out the molecule.\n\nProper IUPAC name: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nPropanoate: ester of propanoic acid → propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Esterify the acid to COOCH3, so propanoate ester is CH2CH2COOCH3.\n\nIf there's a hydroxy on carbon 2, that carbon in the chain becomes CH(OH)-. So the structure would be:\n\nCH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Hence, it's a three-carbon chain where the middle carbon (C2) has a hydroxyl group. Therefore, C2 is bonded to:\n\n- C1 (CH2-COOCH3) side,\n\n- Two hydrogens (since it's CH2(OH)-),\n\n- And the -OH group.\n\nSo, that's structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. In that case, the C2 would have: -OH, two CH2 groups (attached to COOCH3 and to C3), and a hydrogen? Hmm, no. Wait, C2 is connected to:\n\n- C1 (CH2-COOCH3),\n\n- C3 (CH3),\n\nBut that would require:\n\nWait, propanoate is:\n\nCarbon 1: COOCH3,\n\nCarbon 2: CH(OH),\n\nCarbon 3: CH3.\n\nSo the arrangement is COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.\n\nIn that case, the structure around C2 would be:\n\n- COOCH3 (from C1),\n\n- OH,\n\n- CH3 (from C3),\n\n- and a bond to hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).\n\nWait, but if it's COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3 then C2 has four substituents: COOCH3 (attached via a single bond?), wait but then again, the carboxylate is on C1. Maybe here there's a carbonyl group. Wait, no. If it's propanoate, the chain is:\n\nO || C-O-CH3 (from ester), then two more carbons. Wait ack, I think my confusion here is a hindrance. Let's start again.\n\nSorry, perhaps to think in terms of the acid first. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is known as lactic acid, has the structure CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified at the carboxylic acid group (COOH becomes COOCH3), then we get methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate which is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. In this compound, the second carbon (counting from the carboxylic acid as first) is CHOH (hydroxyl group).\n\nThus, in this molecule, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:\n\n- Carboxylic ester group (COOCH3) on the first carbon,\n\n- A hydroxyl group (-OH),\n\n- A methyl group (from CH3- at the third carbon),\n\n- A hydrogen (since the atom is CHOH connected to adjacent carbons).\n\nWait, but, considering the actual connectivity: for the central carbon (second carbon), the substituents are:\n\n1. A carbon (the first carbon) which is part of the carbonyl (COOCH3),\n\nBut the second carbon in such a structure might actually be part of the chain: C1 is the carbonyl carbon (from the ester group), the second carbon is CH(OH), and the third carbon is CH3. Thus, the structure is CH2(OH) connected to COOCH3 and CH3. Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's:\n\nCOOCH3-(CH2)-CH(OH)-(CH3). Wait, but perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, using line structure: COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.\n\nIn this structure, the central carbon (second) is connected to:\n\n1. COOCH3,\n\n2. OH,\n\n3. CH3,\n\n4. and a single H.\n\nTherefore, the substituents would be: COOCH3, OH, CH3, H.\n\nTherefore, four different groups: COOCH3 (a carbonyl ester), hydroxyl (OH), methyl (CH3), and hydrogen (H). Hence, this would create a chiral center on the second carbon. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nDimethyl fumarate, on the other hand, is the diester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid). The structure is (E)-1,2-dicarboxylate with ester groups. The structure would be CH2CH2 with two ester groups (COOCH3) on opposite sides (trans configuration). Dimethyl fumarate's structure is rigid due to the double bond, so each double bond carbon has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one H. The trans arrangement means the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. However, each of the double bond carbons is connected to two identical groups (one H and one COOCH3), so there's no possibility of optical isomerism here—a double bond with two identical groups can't have optical isomers. If those carbons have different substituents, then geometrical isomerism could exist, but it's already fixed as the trans isomer (fumarate vs. maleate as cis).\n\nMoreover, the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\nA (does not show tautomerism) → benzoquinone,\n\nB (shows optical isomerism) → methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nPlease confirm for any mistakes. Wait, wait, but let's check for any other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, dimethyl fumarate, after hydrolysis, becomes fumaric acid, which already without esters wouldn't have such isomerism. Also, since the ester groups are in the trans configuration around a double bond (E-geometry), but even if fumarate itself doesn't have a chiral center. The only possibility for optical isomer here if there was a chiral center elsewhere. But in dimethyl fumarate, the only possible centers are the ester oxygens, but those aren't chiral. So definitely no. Thus, correct.\n\nSo the answers:\n\nA: benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism (option A), cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can.\n\nB: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate can't.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1741218436, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3238, prompt_tokens=507, total_tokens=3745, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

**Answer:**

**A.** **Benzoquinone** does not show tautomerism.  
**B.** **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** exhibits optical isomerism.

---

**Explanation:**

1. **Tautomerism Analysis (A):**  
   - **Benzoquinone**:  
     Its structure involves conjugated carbonyl groups in a stabilized aromatic system. The resonance stabilization of the quinoid structure outweighs the possibility of enol formation, making tautomerism highly unfavorable.  
   - **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
     It has three ketone groups with adjacent α-hydrogens, allowing keto-enol tautomerism to occur readily via enolization.

2. **Optical Isomerism Analysis (B):**  
   - **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
     The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl (-OH), a methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₃), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a hydrogen (-H). This creates a **chiral center**, enabling the existence of enantiomers (optical isomers).  
   - **Dimethyl Fumarate**:  
     It has a planar trans-diester structure (E-geometry) with no chiral centers. The molecule is symmetrical and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.  

Thus:  
- **A = Benzoquinone** (no tautomerism),  
- **B = Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

Optical isomers (enantiomers) require a chiral center - a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents. Let's examine each compound.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the structure CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (the second carbon in the propanoate chain) is attached to:

1. A hydroxyl group (-OH),
2. A methylene group (CH3COO- from the propanoate),
3. A methoxy group (from the ester, COOCH3), and
4. The remaining hydrogen.

Wait, maybe rearranging for clarity: The structure is methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3 esterified with methyl. Wait, no - wait. Wait, propanoate is three carbons. The 2-hydroxypropanoate ester would be:

Structure: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So structure would be: CH2(COOCH3)CH(OH)CH3? Hmm, no. Let me better visualize.

Actually, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is lactic acid: HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. If you esterify the carboxylic acid group (the COOH) with a methyl group, you get methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure would be CH3OOC-CH(OH)-CH3. The central carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to:

- an oxygen from the adjacent carbonyl group (as part of the ester),

Wait, no. Wait the ester is RCOOR', so methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Position 1: COOCH3,

Position 2: -CH(OH)-,

Position 3: CH3.

So the molecule is:

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Wait, propanoate has three carbons. The carboxylic acid is the first carbon, the middle carbon is the 2nd. So lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) is CH3-CHOH-COOH. Then, when you esterify the -COOH group to methyl, it becomes CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the hydroxy group is on the second carbon (the middle one). 

Therefore, the structure is: hydroxy (OH) attached to the central carbon (Carbon 2), connected to a methyl group (Carbon 3), and a COOCH3 group (Carbon 1). So now, Carbon 2 is bonded to:

- One oxygen (hydroxy group), 
- Carbon 1 (COOCH3), 
- Carbon 3 (CH3), 
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, what are the substituents? Let's count Carbon 2 (the chiral center). The bonds are:

1. -OH,
2. -COOCH3,
3. -CH3,
4. -H.

Hence, the attached groups are: OH, COOCH3, CH3, and H. 

But wait−I may be getting the structure wrong. If the original acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Lactic acid is correct as CH3-CHOH-COOH. So after esterification with methyl, it becomes CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Thus, the skeletal structure is CH2(OH)CH2CO-OCH3? Hmm, perhaps I should consider the actual formula. Let's get that straight.

Propanoic acid: CH2CH2COOH. If we're discussing 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, that would be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH. Then, when esterified, methyl ester would replace the -OH of the COOH with OCH3. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3.

So the second carbon (from the COOCH3) is CH2(OH), next to the central CH2. Wait, perhaps this requires clearer analysis. Alternatively, maybe the compound is more accurately named based on substituents. Wait, hydroxy groups are named with the lowest possible numbering. Maybe 2-hydroxy would be:

Structure: The propanoate ester is OCH3-O-C-CH2-CH2-OH. Hmm, perhaps not. To avoid confusion, maybe the correct structural formula is OCH2C(OH)CH2COOCH3 - no, perhaps a better approach is to research.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The parent is propanoic acid with the hydroxyl group on C-2. Therefore:

Carbon 1: carboxylic acid (esterified to methyl) → COOCH3,

Carbon 2: CH(OH),

Carbon 3: the remaining CH3.

So the structure is: COOCH3 attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to a CH3.

So the central carbon (C2) has substituents: -OH, -COOCH3, -CH3, and another single bond. Wait, the central carbon? Let me imagine.

Likely, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has the following structure:

The central carbon (C) is bonded to:

1. A hydroxyl group (-OH),

2. A methyl group (-CH3),

3. A carbonyl group (-COOCH3) attached to the adjacent carbon, but wait that's connected through a single bond. Wait.

Wait, another approach: Propanoate is three carbons. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. The structure should be CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So in this case, the central carbon (second carbon) has:

- A hydroxyl (-OH),

- A methyl group (CH3 from the third carbon?), but third carbon is the COOCH3. Wait, second carbon is CH2. Wait, no:

If propanoate is CH2-COOCH3-CH2? No, maybe that's just wrong.

Hold on, perhaps an image would help, but since I can’t see that, let me try another approach.

Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. If we have a hydroxy group on the second carbon (C2), then it would be CH3-CHOH-COOH. Then, esterifying the COOH group would replace the -OH with OCH3, making it CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So here, the hydroxy group is on C2. The structure around C2 would be:

- CH3 (from C3, actually not directly substituent, but hangs indirect), wait.

Wait, no. Each carbon in the chain must be considered as substituents. The C2 is the central carbon — attached to:

- C1 (COOCH3),

- C3 (CH3),

- two hydrogens,

Wait, but then again, lack a substituent. Wait, how's that possible? Maybe because I'm not correctly thinking through the structure.

Alternative approach: structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The parent chain is three carbons, with the ester group on carbon 1 (COOCH3), alcohol hydroxyl on carbon 2, and methyl on carbon 3. Wait, but propanoate would only have three carbons in total.

Alternatively, would it not be?

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion comes from different numbering. Let me completely map out the molecule.

Proper IUPAC name: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate: ester of propanoic acid → propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Esterify the acid to COOCH3, so propanoate ester is CH2CH2COOCH3.

If there's a hydroxy on carbon 2, that carbon in the chain becomes CH(OH)-. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Hence, it's a three-carbon chain where the middle carbon (C2) has a hydroxyl group. Therefore, C2 is bonded to:

- C1 (CH2-COOCH3) side,

- Two hydrogens (since it's CH2(OH)-),

- And the -OH group.

So, that's structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. In that case, the C2 would have: -OH, two CH2 groups (attached to COOCH3 and to C3), and a hydrogen? Hmm, no. Wait, C2 is connected to:

- C1 (CH2-COOCH3),

- C3 (CH3),

But that would require:

Wait, propanoate is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3,

Carbon 2: CH(OH),

Carbon 3: CH3.

So the arrangement is COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

In that case, the structure around C2 would be:

- COOCH3 (from C1),

- OH,

- CH3 (from C3),

- and a bond to hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).

Wait, but if it's COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3 then C2 has four substituents: COOCH3 (attached via a single bond?), wait but then again, the carboxylate is on C1. Maybe here there's a carbonyl group. Wait, no. If it's propanoate, the chain is:

O || C-O-CH3 (from ester), then two more carbons. Wait ack, I think my confusion here is a hindrance. Let's start again.

Sorry, perhaps to think in terms of the acid first. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is known as lactic acid, has the structure CH3-CHOH-COOH. When esterified at the carboxylic acid group (COOH becomes COOCH3), then we get methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate which is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. In this compound, the second carbon (counting from the carboxylic acid as first) is CHOH (hydroxyl group).

Thus, in this molecule, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- Carboxylic ester group (COOCH3) on the first carbon,

- A hydroxyl group (-OH),

- A methyl group (from CH3- at the third carbon),

- A hydrogen (since the atom is CHOH connected to adjacent carbons).

Wait, but, considering the actual connectivity: for the central carbon (second carbon), the substituents are:

1. A carbon (the first carbon) which is part of the carbonyl (COOCH3),

But the second carbon in such a structure might actually be part of the chain: C1 is the carbonyl carbon (from the ester group), the second carbon is CH(OH), and the third carbon is CH3. Thus, the structure is CH2(OH) connected to COOCH3 and CH3. Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's:

COOCH3-(CH2)-CH(OH)-(CH3). Wait, but perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, using line structure: COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (second) is connected to:

1. COOCH3,

2. OH,

3. CH3,

4. and a single H.

Therefore, the substituents would be: COOCH3, OH, CH3, H.

Therefore, four different groups: COOCH3 (a carbonyl ester), hydroxyl (OH), methyl (CH3), and hydrogen (H). Hence, this would create a chiral center on the second carbon. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate, on the other hand, is the diester of fumaric acid (trans-butenedioic acid). The structure is (E)-1,2-dicarboxylate with ester groups. The structure would be CH2CH2 with two ester groups (COOCH3) on opposite sides (trans configuration). Dimethyl fumarate's structure is rigid due to the double bond, so each double bond carbon has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one H. The trans arrangement means the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. However, each of the double bond carbons is connected to two identical groups (one H and one COOCH3), so there's no possibility of optical isomerism here—a double bond with two identical groups can't have optical isomers. If those carbons have different substituents, then geometrical isomerism could exist, but it's already fixed as the trans isomer (fumarate vs. maleate as cis).

Moreover, the molecule has a plane of symmetry passing through the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the conclusion is:

A (does not show tautomerism) → benzoquinone,

B (shows optical isomerism) → methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Please confirm for any mistakes. Wait, wait, but let's check for any other possibilities.

Alternatively, dimethyl fumarate, after hydrolysis, becomes fumaric acid, which already without esters wouldn't have such isomerism. Also, since the ester groups are in the trans configuration around a double bond (E-geometry), but even if fumarate itself doesn't have a chiral center. The only possibility for optical isomer here if there was a chiral center elsewhere. But in dimethyl fumarate, the only possible centers are the ester oxygens, but those aren't chiral. So definitely no. Thus, correct.

So the answers:

A: benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism (option A), cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can.

B: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and can show optical isomerism, whereas dimethyl fumarate can't.

Dimethyl fumarate, however, does not possess a chiral center; its stereoisomerism is geometric (E/Z) due to the trans double bond, not optical.', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=' Wait, but benzoquinone is non-aromatic when it\'s in the di-keto form. Wait, but in benzoquinone (1,4-diketone), converting to the enol form would de-aromatize the ring, something rare because it\'s a quinone - which is more stabilized as the diketone. So perhaps even if there were alpha hydrogens, the ring would not tautomerize. However, wait, in the para-benzoquinone, where would the hydrogens come from? Let\'s get precise.\n\n1,4-benzoquinone has carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4. Each of these ketones is adjacent to a carbon connected in the ring. But structure-wise, the structure is O=C6H4=O, maybe with conjugated double bonds. But benzene has six carbons, so para-quinone would have oodles of conjugated structure, and the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to C=O) in benzoquinone would be the ring carbons adjacent to the ketones. These carbons are part of the conjugated system. Since benzene’s carbons are each connected to two other carbons and one hydrogen? Not so in the quinone. The benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) structure has two ketones: O=C-(three double bonds). The ring would have two carbonyl groups replacing two CH groups. So the ring is still six-membered, but with two C=O groups. This changes the bonding. Each carbonyl is at positions 1 and 4; the carbons adjacent to each ketone would be ring carbons. Are they CH groups or part of double bonds? Typically, in a quinone like benzoquinone, the structure has conjugated double bonds. For example, positions 1 and 4 are double-bonded to oxygen, with double bonds alternating in the ring. Let me sketch this mentally: carbon 1 is double-bonded to O, carbon 2 is single-bonded to C1 and double-bonded to C3, C3 is single-bonded to C4 (which is double-bonded to O), and so on. So, the structure has conjugated double bonds. But the carbons adjacent to the ketones (the oxygenated carbons)—Carbons 2 and 6 adjacent to C1 (which is the O=C), which would have double and single bonds. Considering the actual structure, these adjacent carbons (like C2 in benzoquinone) would each be either double-bonded to C3 or C1, respectively, and would not have any hydrogen atoms because of their sp² hybridization. Thus, Benzoquinone (1,4) doesn’t have alpha hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl), which would be in positions that are all part of conjugated carbonyl groups or part of the aromatic ring (even though, perhaps, quinones aren\'t truly aromatic since they\'re not a closed conjugated 6 π-electron system). Given that there are no alpha hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Meanwhile, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketones located symmetrically on a cyclohexane ring. Each ketone is a C=O group. Due to the nature of the cyclohexane ring without aromatic stabilization, each carbon adjacent to a ketone (the alpha carbons) would be CH₂ groups. For instance, between each ketone, there\'s a CH₂ group. Thus, each of these CH₂ groups has hydrogen atoms adjacent to the carbonyl, facilitating enol tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone cannot. Therefore, the compound that doesn’t show tautomerism is Benzoquinone (A).\n\nNext, for the second question: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism? Optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom connected to four different substituents. What is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\'s structure? The propanoate part is CH₂CH₂COO−. But methyl ester. So, propanoic acid (CH₂CH₂COOH), where the carboxylic acid is esterified with a methyl group. Specifically, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure: the ester is CH₃-O-CO-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃? Wait, structure-wise, propanoate is CH₂CH₂COO−. Then 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH₂(CH₂OH)COO−, but the way to number may vary. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy substituent would be at the middle carbon: that is, structure: CH2(C)(OH)COO−. So, the full structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3O-CO-CH(CH2OH)-? Wait, need to clarify the position. Let me reconstruct:\n\nPropanoic acid is:\n- Carbon 1: COOH\n- Carbon 2: CH2\n- Carbon 3: CH3\n\nSo, the parent chain is three carbons with COOH on carbon 1, CH2 on carbon 2, and CH3 on carbon 3. If the hydroxyl group (-OH) is on carbon 2, the structure would be: COOH-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? But propanoic acid is three carbons, so that would make 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Wait, functional group gets the lowest number. So in propanoic acid, the COOH is on carbon 1. So introducing a hydroxyl group on carbon 2 would lead to: \n\nStructure: HOOC-CHOH-CH3!? Wait, wait, propanoic acid is CH3-CH2-COOH. When numbering, the COOH is first, so another substituent would be on carbon 2. Therefore, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Therefore, its methyl ester would be methyl ester at the COOH group: OMe- instead of OH on the COO- group. So the structure is: CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3. So then, the central carbon (where the -OH is attached) would have four substituents: an oxygen (ester group via the chain, but perhaps must map it precisely. Let\'s detail each carbon.\n\nThe propanoic acid chain, after esterification with methyl:\n\nChains:\n- Ester oxygen connected to methyl (OCH3)\n- Then the carbonyl group (C=O)\n- The alpha carbon next to carbonyl is CH(OH)\n- Then the next carbon is CH3\n\nSo, the structure is: OMe-C(=O)-CH(OH)-CH3.\n\nLooking at the carbon bearing the -OH group (the CH(OH)), is that carbon attached to four different groups:\n\n1. -OH (hydroxyl)\n2. -COOCH3 (the ester carbonyl)\n3. -CH3 (methyl)\n4. And the hydrogen?\n\nWait, wait. Let\'s parse it step by step.\n\nCarbon chain:\n\nCOOCH3 (methyl ester of propanoic acid). The carboxylate becomes COOCH3. Then the parent chain is three carbons. Structure:\n\nThe carbon chain:\nCarbonyl (C=O) is part of the ester. Then the first carbon (alpha) next to the carbonyl is CH group with hydroxyl (as "2-hydroxy").\n\nWait, confusion in numbering maybe. Propanoic acid is Carboxyl group at C1, then C2 and C3 are CH2 and CH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on C2, which is adjacent to the C1 (carbonyl). So the structure would be:\n\nCH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3.\n\nSo, let’s name that central carbon (bearing O oxygen atoms (as part of COO and OH)), let\'s check that:\n\nThe ester group is O-CO-OCH3 (wait, maybe getting the structure wrong). Ok, the actual structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:\n\nThe acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: HOOC-CHOH-CH3. To make the methyl ester, replace the hydroxyl of the COOH group with OCH3. Hence, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3.\n\nTherefore, the carbon adjacent to the hydroxyl (the central carbon) is connected to:\n\n1. Carbonyl group (COO-)\n2. Hydroxyl (OH)\n3. Methyl group (CH3)\n4. Hydrogen (H)\n\nTherefore, the substituents are: –COOCH3 (since the carbonyl is attached to OCH3 and then via a single bond to the central carbon?), no. Wait, need to correct. Wait, esterified propanoic acid is: -CO-OCH3. Therefore, the actual chain is:\n\nCO-OCH3 (the carbonyl is bonded to OCH3 via an oxygen), then the rest of the carbon chain. So correcting the structure: The central hydroxy-bearing carbon (the one that is the "2" carbon in the original acid) would be attached to:\n\n- to its left (toward the ester group), it\'s bonded to the carbonyl carbon (COOCH3)\n- which one is this? Let me draw it again.\n\nCarboxylic acid ester: the group is R-O-CO-R\'. So the original structure for propanoic acid would be R\'-CO-O-R. No—commonly, for propanoic acid, the structure is CH2CH2COOCH3 (methyl propanoate). For 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the structure is HOOC-CHOH-CH2. But that can\'t be. No, hold on:\n\nPerhaps better ways.\n\nIUPAC nomenclature for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: Pro means three carbons. The -oic acid is on carbon 1.\n\nTherefore, numbering from the COOH group (as carbon 1), the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So carbon 1 is COOH (structure: COOH-CHOH-CH3). Then methyl ester is methyl ester of this acid, so COOCH3 replaces COOH. So structure becomes COOCH3-CHOH-CH3.\n\nThus, the structure is: CH2(C)(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3. Wait, easier:\n\nThe central carbon (carbon 2) in the propanoic acid skeleton is attached to three groups:\n\n- COOCH3 (from the ester group)\n- OH (hydroxyl)\n- CH3 (from carbon 3)\n- And one hydrogen.\n\nSo the four substituents on carbon 2 (the former alpha carbon to the carboxylic acid) are:\n\n- COOCH3 (from carbon 1)\n- OH (hydroxyl group)\n- CH3 (carbon 3)\n- H (hydrogen)\n\nTherefore, the central carbon (carbon 2) has four different groups attached: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has an asymmetric carbon, so it can form enantiomers and therefore exhibit optical isomerism. \n\nHowever, when we check if anything else would interfere, such as if there\'s a plane of symmetry. Let\'s see: the substituents are COOCH3, OH, CH3, H. None of these are the same, thus leading to chirality. Enantiomers would exist. But is there an internal plane of symmetry? Suppose if the three substituents (COOCH3, OH, CH3) are arranged such that a mirror plane exists, but with four different groups, the molecule is inherently chiral.\n\nAdditionally, verifying another angle: the actual example of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is equivalent to methyl lactate. Lactate is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Indeed, lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) is a chiral molecule, and its ester (methyl lactate) would similarly be chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should have optical isomerism.\n\nAlternatively, looking at dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid. Let\'s recap: fumaric acid is (E)-1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with double bond between C2 and C3, making it HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with trans configuration. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is CH3O-CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, with the double bond in the trans (E) configuration. \n\nNow, fumarate has two ester groups. The dimethyl ester here would have a central double bond with each COOCH3 group on either end. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let\'s examine.\n\nEach double-bonded carbon (center of the molecule) is C=C. Each double-bond carbon is connected to:\n\nLeft side: COOCH3 and H.\nRight side: COOCH3 and H.\n\nWait, wait: structure is CH₂=CH, but for fumarate it\'s HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with the double bond. The actual structure of fumarate is trans-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Then its diester would be:\n\nHOOC-CH=CH-COOH → converting both –OH groups of the carboxyls to –OCH3.\n\nSo dimethyl fumarate: CH3O-CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, trans configuration across the double bond.\n\nHence, each carbon of the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen atom. The substituents on each double bond carbon are COOCH3 and H. The other substituents on those carbons are opposite each other due to the trans configuration. \n\nBut those are the same substituents:\n\nFor each of the double-bond carbons (central two):\n- Each is connected to COOCH3 and H, but since it\'s trans, the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. But even so, when considering the entire molecule as a dimethyl fumarate, the two carbons in the double bond are each bonded to (COOH and H) but in ester form. Each has COOCH3 and H. So each central carbon (in the double bond) is bonded to two identical groups (if viewing as E-/trans-).\n\nBut ethylene carbons each bonded to one COOCH3 and one H group. Because it\'s trans, does that make one carbon’s substituents COOCH3 and H, and the other also COOCH3 and H? Then each double bond carbon is bonded to two groups: COOCH3 and H. So, looking at each carbon, maybe each also has a link to another double bond carbon. But in terms of substituents for the purpose of chirality, each has COOCH3, H, and double bond. Double bond isn\'t a substituent but connects to another carbon, so each of these carbons has:\n- Left carbon: COOCH3, H, and the other two bonds are to adjacent carbons (one via the double bond).\nSpecifically, each carbon in the double-bond is:\n\nLeft hand: COOCH3, H, and two bonds (single and double) to adjacent carbons. Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond (C1 and C2):\n\nC1: attached to COOCH3 (from the left), H, and double-bonded to C2.\nC2: attached to COOCH3 (from the right), H, and double-bonded to C1.\nBut double bonds fix the geometry, in trans configuration.\n\nSo, for each of these, the substituents are:\n\nC1: COOCH3, double bond, and two Hs (one? Wait, let\'s visualize exactly.\n\nEach sp² hybridized carbon in ethylene: three substituents (each attached with orbitals). For example, typical trans double bond structure.\n\nCarbon a: connected to COOCH3, carbon b (double bond), and H.\n\nCarbon b: connected to COOCH3, carbon a (double bond), and H. \n\nGiven the trans arrangement, the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. However, for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. Each carbon here (a and b) would have the substituents: COOCH3, H, and two carbons from the double bond (to each other and the next atoms). Since the arrangement is trans, each side is fixed.\n\nLet\'s see carbon a:\n\nAdjacent carbons are connected to:\n\n- OOCR (COOCH3) \n- H\n- C (double bond to carbon b)\n- The next set—sp² hybridized carbons have three substituents in a plane, so orbital arrangement is trigonal. So substituents for each double-bonded carbon are:\n\nFor carbon a:\n1. COOCH3\n2. H\n3. Carbon b (as a double bond)\n\nEach of these substituents is different. But the issue is that for a chiral center, need four different substituents, but in this case, in the context of sp² hybridization, each double-bonded carbon isn\'t a tetrahedral chiral center—it\'s a trigonal center, so chirality is related to the double bond\'s cis/trans isomerism (geometric isomerism), but not optical isomerism. These are two different types of stereoisomerism.\n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate has geometric isomerism (as the cis/trans, but since it\'s fumarate, it’s already the trans isomer), but not optical isomerism. \n\nWait, but what about the other parts?\n\nConsidering even looking for any chiral center elsewhere in dimethyl fumarate. The ester oxygens don’t contribute, and the rest of the molecule (the methyl ester groups; all are symmetrical on the two ends). Thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn\'t have a chiral center as it has planar symmetry.\n\nMeanwhile, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral carbon (C-2). So it can form optical isomers. Therefore, the answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Justifying via structure: yes, since it\'s a carbon attached to four different groups.\n\nTherefore, compound A is benzoquinone (since no tautomerism) and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1741218705, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4165, prompt_tokens=726, total_tokens=4891, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

**Answer:**

**A (Compound that does not show tautomerism):**  
**Benzoquinone**  

Benzoquinone lacks alpha hydrogens (hydrogens on carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups) necessary for keto-enol tautomerism. Its conjugated aromatic system stabilizes the diketone form, and shifting to an enol form would disrupt this stability. In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has alpha hydrogens on its cyclohexane ring, enabling keto-enol tautomerism.

---

**B (Compound that shows optical isomerism):**  
**Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate contains a chiral center at the second carbon, which is bonded to four distinct groups: a hydroxyl (-OH), a methyl ester (-COOCH₃), a methyl (-CH₃), and a hydrogen (-H). This asymmetry allows for enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images), exhibiting optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate, however, does not possess a chiral center; its stereoisomerism is geometric (E/Z) due to the trans double bond, not optical.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Wait, but benzoquinone is non-aromatic when it's in the di-keto form. Wait, but in benzoquinone (1,4-diketone), converting to the enol form would de-aromatize the ring, something rare because it's a quinone - which is more stabilized as the diketone. So perhaps even if there were alpha hydrogens, the ring would not tautomerize. However, wait, in the para-benzoquinone, where would the hydrogens come from? Let's get precise.

1,4-benzoquinone has carbonyl groups at positions 1 and 4. Each of these ketones is adjacent to a carbon connected in the ring. But structure-wise, the structure is O=C6H4=O, maybe with conjugated double bonds. But benzene has six carbons, so para-quinone would have oodles of conjugated structure, and the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to C=O) in benzoquinone would be the ring carbons adjacent to the ketones. These carbons are part of the conjugated system. Since benzene’s carbons are each connected to two other carbons and one hydrogen? Not so in the quinone. The benzoquinone (1,4-benzoquinone) structure has two ketones: O=C-(three double bonds). The ring would have two carbonyl groups replacing two CH groups. So the ring is still six-membered, but with two C=O groups. This changes the bonding. Each carbonyl is at positions 1 and 4; the carbons adjacent to each ketone would be ring carbons. Are they CH groups or part of double bonds? Typically, in a quinone like benzoquinone, the structure has conjugated double bonds. For example, positions 1 and 4 are double-bonded to oxygen, with double bonds alternating in the ring. Let me sketch this mentally: carbon 1 is double-bonded to O, carbon 2 is single-bonded to C1 and double-bonded to C3, C3 is single-bonded to C4 (which is double-bonded to O), and so on. So, the structure has conjugated double bonds. But the carbons adjacent to the ketones (the oxygenated carbons)—Carbons 2 and 6 adjacent to C1 (which is the O=C), which would have double and single bonds. Considering the actual structure, these adjacent carbons (like C2 in benzoquinone) would each be either double-bonded to C3 or C1, respectively, and would not have any hydrogen atoms because of their sp² hybridization. Thus, Benzoquinone (1,4) doesn’t have alpha hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl), which would be in positions that are all part of conjugated carbonyl groups or part of the aromatic ring (even though, perhaps, quinones aren't truly aromatic since they're not a closed conjugated 6 π-electron system). Given that there are no alpha hydrogens, benzoquinone cannot undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Meanwhile, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketones located symmetrically on a cyclohexane ring. Each ketone is a C=O group. Due to the nature of the cyclohexane ring without aromatic stabilization, each carbon adjacent to a ketone (the alpha carbons) would be CH₂ groups. For instance, between each ketone, there's a CH₂ group. Thus, each of these CH₂ groups has hydrogen atoms adjacent to the carbonyl, facilitating enol tautomerism. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo keto-enol tautomerism, whereas benzoquinone cannot. Therefore, the compound that doesn’t show tautomerism is Benzoquinone (A).

Next, for the second question: between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism? Optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom connected to four different substituents. What is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's structure? The propanoate part is CH₂CH₂COO−. But methyl ester. So, propanoic acid (CH₂CH₂COOH), where the carboxylic acid is esterified with a methyl group. Specifically, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure: the ester is CH₃-O-CO-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₃? Wait, structure-wise, propanoate is CH₂CH₂COO−. Then 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH₂(CH₂OH)COO−, but the way to number may vary. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy substituent would be at the middle carbon: that is, structure: CH2(C)(OH)COO−. So, the full structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3O-CO-CH(CH2OH)-? Wait, need to clarify the position. Let me reconstruct:

Propanoic acid is:
- Carbon 1: COOH
- Carbon 2: CH2
- Carbon 3: CH3

So, the parent chain is three carbons with COOH on carbon 1, CH2 on carbon 2, and CH3 on carbon 3. If the hydroxyl group (-OH) is on carbon 2, the structure would be: COOH-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? But propanoic acid is three carbons, so that would make 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Wait, functional group gets the lowest number. So in propanoic acid, the COOH is on carbon 1. So introducing a hydroxyl group on carbon 2 would lead to: 

Structure: HOOC-CHOH-CH3!? Wait, wait, propanoic acid is CH3-CH2-COOH. When numbering, the COOH is first, so another substituent would be on carbon 2. Therefore, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. Therefore, its methyl ester would be methyl ester at the COOH group: OMe- instead of OH on the COO- group. So the structure is: CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3. So then, the central carbon (where the -OH is attached) would have four substituents: an oxygen (ester group via the chain, but perhaps must map it precisely. Let's detail each carbon.

The propanoic acid chain, after esterification with methyl:

Chains:
- Ester oxygen connected to methyl (OCH3)
- Then the carbonyl group (C=O)
- The alpha carbon next to carbonyl is CH(OH)
- Then the next carbon is CH3

So, the structure is: OMe-C(=O)-CH(OH)-CH3.

Looking at the carbon bearing the -OH group (the CH(OH)), is that carbon attached to four different groups:

1. -OH (hydroxyl)
2. -COOCH3 (the ester carbonyl)
3. -CH3 (methyl)
4. And the hydrogen?

Wait, wait. Let's parse it step by step.

Carbon chain:

COOCH3 (methyl ester of propanoic acid). The carboxylate becomes COOCH3. Then the parent chain is three carbons. Structure:

The carbon chain:
Carbonyl (C=O) is part of the ester. Then the first carbon (alpha) next to the carbonyl is CH group with hydroxyl (as "2-hydroxy").

Wait, confusion in numbering maybe. Propanoic acid is Carboxyl group at C1, then C2 and C3 are CH2 and CH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on C2, which is adjacent to the C1 (carbonyl). So the structure would be:

CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, let’s name that central carbon (bearing O oxygen atoms (as part of COO and OH)), let's check that:

The ester group is O-CO-OCH3 (wait, maybe getting the structure wrong). Ok, the actual structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: HOOC-CHOH-CH3. To make the methyl ester, replace the hydroxyl of the COOH group with OCH3. Hence, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3.

Therefore, the carbon adjacent to the hydroxyl (the central carbon) is connected to:

1. Carbonyl group (COO-)
2. Hydroxyl (OH)
3. Methyl group (CH3)
4. Hydrogen (H)

Therefore, the substituents are: –COOCH3 (since the carbonyl is attached to OCH3 and then via a single bond to the central carbon?), no. Wait, need to correct. Wait, esterified propanoic acid is: -CO-OCH3. Therefore, the actual chain is:

CO-OCH3 (the carbonyl is bonded to OCH3 via an oxygen), then the rest of the carbon chain. So correcting the structure: The central hydroxy-bearing carbon (the one that is the "2" carbon in the original acid) would be attached to:

- to its left (toward the ester group), it's bonded to the carbonyl carbon (COOCH3)
- which one is this? Let me draw it again.

Carboxylic acid ester: the group is R-O-CO-R'. So the original structure for propanoic acid would be R'-CO-O-R. No—commonly, for propanoic acid, the structure is CH2CH2COOCH3 (methyl propanoate). For 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the structure is HOOC-CHOH-CH2. But that can't be. No, hold on:

Perhaps better ways.

IUPAC nomenclature for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: Pro means three carbons. The -oic acid is on carbon 1.

Therefore, numbering from the COOH group (as carbon 1), the hydroxyl is on carbon 2. So carbon 1 is COOH (structure: COOH-CHOH-CH3). Then methyl ester is methyl ester of this acid, so COOCH3 replaces COOH. So structure becomes COOCH3-CHOH-CH3.

Thus, the structure is: CH2(C)(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3. Wait, easier:

The central carbon (carbon 2) in the propanoic acid skeleton is attached to three groups:

- COOCH3 (from the ester group)
- OH (hydroxyl)
- CH3 (from carbon 3)
- And one hydrogen.

So the four substituents on carbon 2 (the former alpha carbon to the carboxylic acid) are:

- COOCH3 (from carbon 1)
- OH (hydroxyl group)
- CH3 (carbon 3)
- H (hydrogen)

Therefore, the central carbon (carbon 2) has four different groups attached: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. Thus, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has an asymmetric carbon, so it can form enantiomers and therefore exhibit optical isomerism. 

However, when we check if anything else would interfere, such as if there's a plane of symmetry. Let's see: the substituents are COOCH3, OH, CH3, H. None of these are the same, thus leading to chirality. Enantiomers would exist. But is there an internal plane of symmetry? Suppose if the three substituents (COOCH3, OH, CH3) are arranged such that a mirror plane exists, but with four different groups, the molecule is inherently chiral.

Additionally, verifying another angle: the actual example of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is equivalent to methyl lactate. Lactate is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Indeed, lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) is a chiral molecule, and its ester (methyl lactate) would similarly be chiral. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, looking at dimethyl fumarate. Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid. Let's recap: fumaric acid is (E)-1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. Its structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with double bond between C2 and C3, making it HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with trans configuration. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is CH3O-CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, with the double bond in the trans (E) configuration. 

Now, fumarate has two ester groups. The dimethyl ester here would have a central double bond with each COOCH3 group on either end. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's examine.

Each double-bonded carbon (center of the molecule) is C=C. Each double-bond carbon is connected to:

Left side: COOCH3 and H.
Right side: COOCH3 and H.

Wait, wait: structure is CH₂=CH, but for fumarate it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with the double bond. The actual structure of fumarate is trans-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Then its diester would be:

HOOC-CH=CH-COOH → converting both –OH groups of the carboxyls to –OCH3.

So dimethyl fumarate: CH3O-CO-CH=CH-CO-OCH3, trans configuration across the double bond.

Hence, each carbon of the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen atom. The substituents on each double bond carbon are COOCH3 and H. The other substituents on those carbons are opposite each other due to the trans configuration. 

But those are the same substituents:

For each of the double-bond carbons (central two):
- Each is connected to COOCH3 and H, but since it's trans, the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. But even so, when considering the entire molecule as a dimethyl fumarate, the two carbons in the double bond are each bonded to (COOH and H) but in ester form. Each has COOCH3 and H. So each central carbon (in the double bond) is bonded to two identical groups (if viewing as E-/trans-).

But ethylene carbons each bonded to one COOCH3 and one H group. Because it's trans, does that make one carbon’s substituents COOCH3 and H, and the other also COOCH3 and H? Then each double bond carbon is bonded to two groups: COOCH3 and H. So, looking at each carbon, maybe each also has a link to another double bond carbon. But in terms of substituents for the purpose of chirality, each has COOCH3, H, and double bond. Double bond isn't a substituent but connects to another carbon, so each of these carbons has:
- Left carbon: COOCH3, H, and the other two bonds are to adjacent carbons (one via the double bond).
Specifically, each carbon in the double-bond is:

Left hand: COOCH3, H, and two bonds (single and double) to adjacent carbons. Wait, no, each carbon in the double bond (C1 and C2):

C1: attached to COOCH3 (from the left), H, and double-bonded to C2.
C2: attached to COOCH3 (from the right), H, and double-bonded to C1.
But double bonds fix the geometry, in trans configuration.

So, for each of these, the substituents are:

C1: COOCH3, double bond, and two Hs (one? Wait, let's visualize exactly.

Each sp² hybridized carbon in ethylene: three substituents (each attached with orbitals). For example, typical trans double bond structure.

Carbon a: connected to COOCH3, carbon b (double bond), and H.

Carbon b: connected to COOCH3, carbon a (double bond), and H. 

Given the trans arrangement, the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. However, for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. Each carbon here (a and b) would have the substituents: COOCH3, H, and two carbons from the double bond (to each other and the next atoms). Since the arrangement is trans, each side is fixed.

Let's see carbon a:

Adjacent carbons are connected to:

- OOCR (COOCH3) 
- H
- C (double bond to carbon b)
- The next set—sp² hybridized carbons have three substituents in a plane, so orbital arrangement is trigonal. So substituents for each double-bonded carbon are:

For carbon a:
1. COOCH3
2. H
3. Carbon b (as a double bond)

Each of these substituents is different. But the issue is that for a chiral center, need four different substituents, but in this case, in the context of sp² hybridization, each double-bonded carbon isn't a tetrahedral chiral center—it's a trigonal center, so chirality is related to the double bond's cis/trans isomerism (geometric isomerism), but not optical isomerism. These are two different types of stereoisomerism.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate has geometric isomerism (as the cis/trans, but since it's fumarate, it’s already the trans isomer), but not optical isomerism. 

Wait, but what about the other parts?

Considering even looking for any chiral center elsewhere in dimethyl fumarate. The ester oxygens don’t contribute, and the rest of the molecule (the methyl ester groups; all are symmetrical on the two ends). Thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center as it has planar symmetry.

Meanwhile, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral carbon (C-2). So it can form optical isomers. Therefore, the answer for B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Justifying via structure: yes, since it's a carbon attached to four different groups.

Therefore, compound A is benzoquinone (since no tautomerism) and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism).
