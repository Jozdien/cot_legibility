# Original Question

You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's try to figure out this genetics problem. So, we have a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but produces an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the mutants. Four mutants are given, each with a slight change in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. 

First, I need to remember that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) is a chemical mutagen that typically induces point mutations, specifically alkylating guanine, leading to GC to AT transitions. So in the DNA sequence, EMS tends to change a G to an A or a C to a T, since during replication, the alkylated G pairs with T instead of C. But the problem states mutations at the beginning of the first exon. The mutations occur here because exons are coding regions. Mutations here could lead to changes in the protein product. If the gene's product is the enzyme responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, a mutation that disrupts the enzyme's function would stop the compound from being synthesized. 

So to eliminate the compound, we probably need a loss-of-function mutation. This could be a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon), a frameshift causing a drastically altered protein, or maybe a critical missense mutation in an essential part of the enzyme. However, sometimes even a missense might not completely disable the enzyme. Frameshifts or nonsense mutations are more likely to result in a nonfunctional protein.

Let's look at each mutant:

Original gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

I need to figure out the coding strand. Usually, the DNA is written as the coding strand (same as mRNA, which is synthesized from the template). So the mRNA would start with AUG, which is the start codon. The original DNA starts with ATG, so that makes sense.

Translating the original DNA sequence into protein:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Amino acids:
M (Met) - start,
Then TTT is Phe (F),
CTC is Leu (L),
GCT is Ala (A),
GGT is Gly (G),
ACT is Thr (T),
TCT is Ser (S),
GTG is Val (V),
GAT is Asp (D),
GAA is Glu (E),
CAT is His (H),
ATT is Ile (I),
TAT is Tyr (Y),
TGT is Cys (C),
CGT is Arg (R),
TGA is stop.

Wait, hold on: When translating, remember that the DNA is written 5' to 3' but the mRNA is synthesized complementary to the template strand, so the coding DNA strand is 5' to 3', same as mRNA but with T instead of U. To translate the DNA sequence, we can read it as mRNA by replacing T with U. So for example:

ATG DNA is AUG in mRNA => Met.

Now let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 1:5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Let's compare. The original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Mutant 1 starts with ATG TTC TAC GCT...

Wait, looking at the sequences:

Original positions: Let's track changes. Let's break both into codons. Maybe multiple ways to look:

Original: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T...
Mutant1: A T G T T C T A C G C T G G T...

Wait, the original's third nucleotide after ATG is TTT (codes for Phe). In Mutant 1, after ATG (positions 4-6), instead of TTT (Phe), we have TCT (Ser) maybe? Wait, actually I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe we need to see the exact point mutation.

Original: ...TTT CTC GCT... → positions 4-6: TTT (assuming first three are ATG), then the next three are TCT (Ser at positions 7-9?), but this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe another approach: compare the two sequences step by step from the start.

Original: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA-3’

Comparing each triplet:

First codon: ATG (same) → Met.

Second codon in original: TTT (F), mutant: TTC. So TTT → TTC. Both code for Phe. Therefore, this is a silent mutation. No effect.

Third codon original: CTC (Leu); mutant: TAC (Tyr). Wait, but that’s a big leap. Wait, substituting the first nucleotide? Let's check:

Original third codon is at positions 7-9. Wait ATG is 1-3, TTT is 4-6, CTC is 7-9, etc.

Wait, mutant 1 differs from original starting somewhere. Let's look at actual sequences character by character.

Original:

ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Wait better to write them out as sequences:

Original sequence (from start):

1 ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T ... etc.

Mutant 1:

ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T...

Wait, where's the first difference?

Original: position 4 is T, in mutant 1 where? Let's compare the sequences base by base.

Indices (assuming start is position 1):

1-3: ATG (same in both)

Original pos4: T

Mutant1 pos4: T

Then pos5: Original T → Mutant1 T? Wait, original has T then T (positions 4 and 5) followed by T (pos6)? Wait actual sequences:

Original: 5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T ACT TCT GTG GAT... etc.

So positions 1-3: ATG

Positions 4-6: TTT (the second codon, Phe)

Positions 7-9: C T C (codon CTC, Leu)

Then 10-12: G C T (codon GCT, Ala)

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So? Let's see: perhaps there's a deletion here? Wait length:

The original starts with ATG TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Mutant1 starts with ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Wait, the original third codon (positions 7-9) is CTC. In mutant1, we have TAC at positions 7-9. How does that happen? Let me check the DNA sequences:

Original: Positions 4-6: TTT.

Mutant1: TT C (pos4-6 as TTC) → same as TTT but C instead of T in the third position? Wait TTT (original) vs. TTC (mutant1).

Wait positions 4,5,6:

Original: T T T, mutant 1: T T C. So at position 6: original T → C. So the third base changes from T to C. The original codon is TTT (Phe), which in mutant1 becomes TTC (still Phe). So that's a silent mutation (no effect).

But moving on, the next codons in original? After TTT, the next codons:

Original:

exon continues: positions 7-9: CTC (Leu), 10-12: GCT (Ala), etc.

Mutant1: After TTC (position4-6), the next parts?

Wait, in mutant1, after 4-6 (TTC) comes T A C... Let's see:

Original: Position7: C, pos8: T, pos9: C → CTC.

Mutant1's position7: T? No, perhaps positions shifted? Let me mark actual indices:

Original, positions 4-....

Suppose the original sequence after ATG (positions 1-3) is:

4 T, 5 T, 6 T (TTT),

7 C, 8 T, 9 C (CTC),

10 G, 11 C, 12 T (GCT),

Then mutant 1 sequence after ATG:

4 T,5 T,6 C (TTC),

7 T,8 A,9 C (TAC?).

Ah, so in mutant1, after the first three bases (ATG), the next three are TTC (positions4-6), then at positions7-9 we have TAC.

Comparing this to original where positions7-9 are CTC. So T at pos7 was changed from C to T, pos8 original T → A in mutant1, pos9 original C → C. Wait wait, in original CTC at positions7-8-9. So original at pos7 is C. In mutant1, at pos7 after TTC (positions4-6 is TTC), pos7 is T. So, is there a change at the DNA sequence here?

Original:

Positions:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: C T C → C in pos7, T in pos8, C in pos9.

Mutant1 ?

After 1-3 (ATG (same)), positions4-6: T T C.

Positions7-9: T A C.

So comparing pos7: original is C (position7) becomes T in mutant1. pos8: original T becomes A. pos9: original C remains C. Hmm. So in the original codon positions7-9: CTC, mutant1 has TAC. So changing nucleotides here cause the codon to be TAC instead of CTC. Then, the amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr.

That's a missense mutation. So in mutant1, the third amino acid changes from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC (DNA is TAC, mRNA would see complementary since DNA is coding strand; DNA is 5' to 3', mRNA is complementary. Wait, wait. When you transcribe DNA into mRNA, the mRNA is complementary to the template DNA strand. If the gene is written as the coding strand (5' to 3'), then the mRNA will match this except T→U. So for codon in DNA, if the coding strand has CTC, mRNA has CUC (Leu). Similarly, in mutant1 DNA has TAC, so mRNA is UAC (Tyr). So the original codon in DNA positions7-9 is CTC (DNA) which becomes TAC in DNA. Thus mRNA codon would be CUC → UAC. So the amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr. That's a missense. So would that disrupt the protein? Possibly, but not necessarily. Maybe this is in a critical area. Alternatively, maybe it's a active site, so changing an amino acid would disrupt enzyme function. But Tyr is a large aromatic residue, where Leu is hydrophobic. Depending on the position, maybe functional. However, possible that that mutation is not so bad. Not a frameshift, only a single amino acid substitution. So this is perhaps not enough to eliminate the compound entirely. Maybe reduces its production, but maybe not. So mutant1 is a candidate but not sure if the best.

Mutant 2:

Mutant 2:5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Compare with original.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ...

So let's break it down:

After ATG (positions1-3), original is TTT (positions4-6)

Mutant2 has TTC at positions4-6 (Phe as well). Then, original positions7-9 are CTC, but in mutant2, positions7-9 are TAA.

So CTC (Leu) mutated to TAA. Let's look at the DNA.

Original DNA codon CTC (Leu) becomes TAA. The mRNA would be UAA if the DNA change is from CTC (coding) to TAA. TAA in DNA (coding/sense) is the codon UAA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. So positions7-9, which originally code for Leu (CTC / CUC in mRNA), now being TAA → UAA stop. So this is a nonsense mutation. This would truncate the protein at the third amino acid, replacing it with a stop. Since the original protein starts with Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly... an early stop (after Met-Phe-Leu-Stop), the protein would be just four amino acids long. That would likely completely abolish the production of the anti-nutritional compound as the enzyme is non-functional. So this is a strong candidate. Mutant2: change from CTC to TAA, which introduces a premature stop codon.

Mutant3:

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original has: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...

Mutant3’s sequence after ATG:

Original compares up:

Look for sequence alignment. Original has TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3 has TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT... seems like some insertion or change.

Wait looking step by step:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T...

Mutant3: ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C...

Wait original positions4-6 are TTT (codon TTT), whereas mutant also has this. So positions4-6 are the same. Then original positions7-9: CTC (codon CTC) becomes TAC in mutant3? No, mutant3’s fourth and fifth positions?

Wait see precise alignment: Let's check each codon step.

Original:

1  2  3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12...
A  T  G  T  T  T  C  T  C  G  C  T  G  G  T  A  C  T...
Met Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr... 

Wait in mutant3's sequence:

Creates:

ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C...

Positions 4,5,6: TTT (same as original; cod4-6 as Phe).

Then, original pos7-9: C T C (CTC, Leu); but in mutant3, after TTT (cod4-6), pos7 is T, pos8 A (original T), pos9 C (original C). So it's T A C instead of C T C. Wait: checking if that's T A C. So positions7-9 are TAC (codon), mRNA would be UAC (Tyr). Original at that spot: C T C → mRNA CUC (Leu). Therefore, a Leu to Tyr substitution. So a missense mutation.

But then after that in original codon 10-12: GCT (Ala) seems unchanged: sequences from cod10 onwards? K… maybe there's an insertion?

Wait the rest is the challenge here, perhaps. Let's see:

Next part in the original codons:

cod10: GCT (Ala)... JGs:

Original:
codon positions (assuming first codon ATG is 1-3):

cod1: ATG (M)
cod2: TTT (F)
cod3: CTC (L)
cod4: GCT (A)
cod5: GGT (G)
cod6: ACT (T)
cod7: TCT (S)
cod8: GTG (V)
cod9: GAT (D)
cod10: GAA (E)
cod11: CAT (H)
cod12: ATT (I)
cod13: TAT (Y)
cod14: TGT (C)
cod15: CGT (R)
… and so on.

Now mutant3:

Let's read codons for mutant3:

# Anthropic completion

Let me rephrase this genetics problem analysis:

We're examining a barley variety that resists drought but produces an unwanted nutritional compound. The gene producing this compound contains five exons and four introns. Scientists used EMS mutagenesis and DNA sequencing to study mutants, focusing on four variants with changes in the first exon region. They're trying to determine which mutation would stop the unwanted compound's production.

EMS mutagenesis typically creates point mutations by modifying guanine bases, resulting in GC to AT base pair changes. During DNA replication, the modified guanine pairs with thymine instead of cytosine. These mutations are significant in exons since they're protein-coding regions that could alter the final protein product. If the gene creates an enzyme that produces the unwanted compound, disrupting the enzyme's function would prevent the compound's formation.

To eliminate the compound, we're likely looking for a mutation that deactivates the gene. This could happen through a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), a reading frame disruption (frameshift), or a crucial amino acid change (missense mutation) in an important enzyme region. Frameshift or nonsense mutations typically have a higher chance of completely disabling the protein compared to missense mutations.

Looking at the gene sequences:

The original DNA sequence reads:
5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA-3'

To determine the coding strand, we note it should match mRNA sequence (with T instead of U) and start with ATG (start codon). This sequence fits that pattern.

When converting to protein sequence:
The start codon ATG codes for Methionine
TTT codes for Phenylalanine
CTC codes for Leucine
GCT codes for Alanine
GGT codes for Glycine
ACT codes for Threonine
TCT codes for Serine
GTG codes for Valine
GAT codes for Aspartic acid
GAA codes for Glutamic acid
CAT codes for Histidine
ATT codes for Isoleucine
TAT codes for Tyrosine
TGT codes for Cysteine
CGT codes for Arginine
TGA is the stop codon

Examining Mutant 1:
Original: 5'-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA-3'
Mutant 1: 5'-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA-3'

Comparing the sequences base by base, we see the first change at position 6, where T becomes C. This changes the codon TTT to TTC, but both code for phenylalanine, making this a silent mutation with no effect on the protein.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's try to solve this genetics problem. We have a barley cultivar that's resistant to drought but produces an anti-nutritional compound. The gene causing this has five exons and four introns. EMS mutagenesis was used to create and sequence mutants. Four mutants were studied, each having minor alterations in the region of the first exon. The task is to identify which mutation stops the production of the anti-nutritional compound.

First, recall that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) is a chemical mutagen that usually causes point mutations by alkylating guanine, thus leading to GC to AT transitions. In other words, EMS typically changes a G to an A, or a C to a T, as the altered G pairs with T instead of C during replication. The focus is on mutations at the start of the first exon, as exons are coding regions, and mutations here can alter the protein product. If the gene encodes the enzyme responsible for synthesizing the anti-nutritional compound, a mutation that disrupts the enzyme’s function could prevent the compound from being produced.

To eliminate this compound, we need a loss-of-function mutation, which might occur through a nonsense mutation (premature stop codon), a frameshift leading to a substantially altered protein, or possibly a critical missense mutation in a vital part of the enzyme. Nonsense or frameshift mutations are more likely to result in a non-functional protein.

Examining each mutant:

Original gene sequence:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

We need to decode the coding strand. Usually, DNA is depicted as the coding strand (identical to mRNA except for U replacing T). So, mRNA starts with AUG, the start codon. The original DNA has ATG, which fits.

Translating the original DNA sequence into protein:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Amino acids:
- ATG => Met (start)
- TTT => Phe
- CTC => Leu
- GCT => Ala
- GGT => Gly
- ACT => Thr
- TCT => Ser
- GTG => Val
- GAT => Asp
- GAA => Glu
- CAT => His
- ATT => Ile
- TAT => Tyr
- TGT => Cys
- CGT => Arg
- TGA => stop

When translating, read DNA 5' to 3' same as mRNA but replace T with U in the translation.

Now, let's evaluate each mutant:

Mutant 1:
Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing codons:
First codon is ATG in both. This codes for Met.
Second codon: Original is TTT (Phe), Mutant 1 is TTC, still Phe. This is a silent mutation (no effect).
Third codon: Original CTC (Leu); Mutant 1 TAC (Tyr). A shift happens here.

Investigating further:
To point out differences, write sequences one by one.

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Find differences:
Original 4-6: TTT (Phe) versus Mutant 1: TTC (Phe), a silent mutation.
The next codon change: Original CTC (Leu) is replaced with TAC (Tyr), indicating a shift or alteration.

In practice, compare actual mutations carefully to identify the loss-of-function alteration needed to cease the anti-nutritional compound's production.

This null mutation is most likely to eliminate the enzyme responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, making it the optimal choice. \n\n**Answer:** Mutant 2", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning='i: C T C (positions 7-9). Wait, positions 7-9: C T C (CTC) in original. Now Mutant1:\n\nOriginal positions 7-9: C T C → After mutation, which part changes? Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe the mutants differ earlier... Alternatively, there\'s a substitution before that.\n\nWait the mutant1 sequence as given is:\n\nATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nIf we count from the start:\n\nFirst 3: ATG (positions 1-3)\n\nThen next 3: TTC (positions 4-6) instead of TTT.\n\nThen next 3: TAC (positions 7-9) instead of CTC.\n\nAh, so the third codon in mutant1 is TAC (Tyr) vs original CTC (Leu).\n\nSo how was this achieved? The original\'s third codon is CTC (positions 7-9). But in mutant1, positions 7-9 are TAC. Let\'s compare the DNA changes:\n\nOriginal: C T C (positions7-9, which would be on coding strand, which is mRNA equivalent T C T? Wait, no, DNA is written 5\' to 3\'. The mRNA is complementary to the template strand, but the coding strand is the same as the mRNA but with T instead of U.\n\nWait, in the original DNA sequence coding strand is given as 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT..., so mRNA is AUGUUUCUCGCUGGUACU..., which would translate to Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...\n\nIn Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...\n\nmRNA would be AUGUUCUACGCUGGUACU...\n\nSo, codons:\n\nMutant1 codons: Met (AUG), Phe (UUC), Tyr (UAC), Ala (GCU), etc. So the third codon is TAC (Tyr). Original was CTC in DNA, which becomes CUC in mRNA (Leu). So in DNA, the change is from CTC to TAC. How? Let me check the actual DNA. \n\nOriginal third codon (DNA) is CTC. In mutant1, third codon is TAC. \n\nSo first position: C→T, second T→A, third C→C? That seems like two substitutions. Wait C T C (original) becoming T A C. Wait, two mutations in the same codon. But EMS typically causes single point mutations. However, maybe that\'s a possibility given their collection. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the codon positions. Alternatively, maybe the mistake is elsewhere. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal Sequence:\n\nOriginal 5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T ACT TCT GTG GAT... 3’\n\nPositions 7-9: nucleotides 7,8,9 are C, T, C (CTC). That\'s codon for Leu (CUC in mRNA codes for Leu).\n\nMutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T ... ACT TCT...\n\nPositions 7-9 here: T, A, C. So TAC. So the original was CTC. At position7: C→T, position8: T→A, position9: C maintains. But that would require two mutations in the same codon, which is possible but less likely from EMS, which usually induces single base changes. So perhaps the alignment is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a deletion in the gene in Mutant1? Wait no, the overall length seems the same; Mutant1\'s sequence isn\'t shorter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a typo in the problem, but assuming it\'s correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution is CTC → TAC in DNA, meaning in the mRNA it would be from CUC (Leu) to UAC (Tyr). That\'s a missense mutation. So whether this affects the protein\'s function depends on where Leu is replaced by Tyr. If this amino acid is in the active site of the enzyme, it could disrupt function. But maybe even this isn\'t sufficient.\n\nMutant1 has two nucleotide changes (if it\'s CTC to TAC in DNA), which may be two point mutations. But EMS could cause each of these separately, but having two in the same codon might be less probable. However, the problem states that the collection of mutants have some changes at the beginning, maybe even multiple mutations.\n\nBut let\'s check the other mutants.\n\nMutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nComparing:\n\nOriginal starts: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...\n\nMutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...\n\nSo original is T T T (Phe), then CTC (Leu).\n\nMutant2: TTC (Phe still, because position4-6: T T T → T T C? Wait, TTT to TTC: same as Mutant1\'s second codon. Then the third codon in Mutant2 is TAA?\n\nLooking at the DNA sequence, after TTC in positions4-6 comes TAA (positions7-9).\n\nThree nucleotides TAA as codon on DNA. The mRNA would be UAA, which is a stop codon. So if this is the case, the third codon in mRNA would be UAA (stop codon). That would cause premature termination of translation, leading to a truncated protein. This is a nonsense mutation. If the original gene\'s protein is  broken by an early stop codon, it wouldn\'t be functional. The product would be a short peptide, perhaps not functional for producing the anti-nutritional compound. This seems like a strong candidate for eliminating the compound. \n\nBut let\'s confirm:\n\nOriginal third codon (CTC in DNA, CUC in mRNA → Leu).\n\nIn mutant2, third codon in DNA is TAA.\n\nOn mRNA, that becomes UAA, which is a stop codon. So the protein would be Met (start), Phe (from TTC), then stop. This would truncate the protein right after the second amino acid. That would almost certainly disrupt the enzyme\'s function completely, so no anti-nutritional compound. That would be a good candidate.\n\nMutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal: …ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…\n\nCompare:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTG...\n\nMutant3: TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...\n\nLooking at codons:\n\nOriginal: first codon after ATG (TTT), which is Phe. Then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc.\n\nMutant3: after ATG, TTT (Phe), then TAC (Tyr, which in DNA is TAC, so mRNA UAC), then GCT, GGT GTC ACT... \n\nWait, need to check the mutation in the exon. Are these insertions or substitutions? Let\'s see precisely where the mutations are.\n\nOriginal starts with:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nMutant3:\n\nATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nSo at positions 7-9, original CTC becomes TAC. That\'s two changes (C→T and T→A in positions7-8, with original C T C, mutant T A C. So then mRNA would be TAC (DNA) so mRNA UAC (Tyr) instead of CUC (Leu). Missense mutation. Then next codon, GGT (Gly) in original becomes GTC (Val) in mutant3. How?\n\nOriginal coding for that codon (positions10-12) is GCT (Ala). Wait, perhaps need to recount:\n\nOriginal exon sequence:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nSecond codon: TTT (F)\n\nThird: CTC (L)\n\nFourth: GCT (A)\n\nFifth: GGT (G)\n\nSixth: ACT (T)\n\nSeventh: TCT (S)\n\nThen in mutant3:\n\nAfter TTT, we have TAC (third codon instead of CTC), then GCT (A: same as original). Then GGT stays, but the next codon in original is ACT (T), but mutant3 has GTC: wait let\'s see.\n\nWait in the Mutant3 sequence given:\n\n...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT... So in the sequence GGTGTCACT.\n\nOriginal: GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT (GGT = positions X-X, then ACT, etc.)\n\nMutant3\'s sequence: GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...\n\nSo original fifth codon: ACT (Thr) in positions, let\'s say, 16-18 (but depends on exact numbering) and mutant3 changes that to GTC (Val) in the codon where it was ACT. Wait, how? Original ACT is Threonine. To become GTC (Val), how did the DNA change? Original ACT would be DNA ACT, mRNA ACU (Thr). Mutant\'s codon is GTC in DNA, which is mRNA GUC (Val). So in the DNA, A in position 1 of the codon (of its position) changed to G. Since EMS typically causes GC to AT transitions (G to A or C to T). But this mutation is an A to G transition. Wait, is that possible?\n\nEMS typically alkylates guanine, which pairs with T, leading to GC→AT transition. But here, if the original is A (in ACT codon), changing to G would require a transition from A to G, which can happen from EMS if the original was a purine (A or G). Wait EMS is more likely to cause transitions in Gs. However, there\'s also the possibility that during replication, the alkylated G pairs with T, leading to a G:C → A:T mutation.\n\nWait, but other mutagens may cause different mutations. However, in the problem, we just know that EMS was used. So the mutation from A→G would not be typical of EMS. But perhaps this is a rare mutation, but I\'ll note that. Regardless, let\'s focus on the impact. So in mutant3, the fifth codon (ACT in original DNA → GTC in mutant DNA) leads to mRNA codon GUC (Val) instead of ACU (Thr). This is a missense mutation. Plus, there\'s another change at the third codon (original CTC → TAC). So two amino acid substitutions here. Might this affect the enzyme\'s function? It depends, but if those positions are critical, maybe. But without knowing the enzyme\'s structure, it\'s hard. However, whether it\'s worse than a nonsense mutation?\n\nMutant4:5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ \n\nOriginal sequence: ...ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...\n\nMutant4: ...ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...\n\nComparison: let\'s look at the start:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTC GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant4 after ATG: TTTACGCTACTTCT...\n\nSo substituting some parts and perhaps a deletion. Let\'s see:\n\nOriginal DNA from position 4: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...\n\nMutant4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T...\n\nWait, perhaps the mutant4 has a deletion. Let\'s count the bases. Original starts with:\n\nATG (3) TTT (3) CTC (3) GCT (3) GGT (3) ACT (3) TCT (3)... (Total so far: 3+3+3+3+3+3=18 bases).\n\nMutant4: \n\nATG (3) T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G A T... \n\nWait, in the original, from position 4 onwards: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...\n\nMutant4 from position4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T...\n\nIt looks like there\'s missing sequence. Specifically, original has after TTT, the next is CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... whereas mutant4 after TTT becomes ACGCTACTTCT...\n\nWait comparing:\n\nOriginal: after TTT (positions4-6: F), then positions7-9: CTC (L), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: ACT (T), 19-21: TCT (S).\n\nMutant4: after TTT (positions4-6), then positions7-9: ACG (Thr?), then 10-12: CTA (Leu?), then 13-15: CTT (Leu?), and on. Wait, maybe it\'s better to write step by step:\n\nOriginal and Mutant4:\n\nOriginal sequences:\nPositions Start: 1-3: ATG\n4-6: TTT\n7-9: CTC\n10-12: GCT\n13-15: GGT\n16-18: ACT\n19-21: TCT...\n\nMutant4 sequence after ATG:\nPositions4-6: TTT\nThen positions7-9: ACG\n10-12: CTA\n13-15: CTT...\n\nComparing the coding:\n\nOriginal from positions7-18: CTC GCT GGT ACT (Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr)\n\nMutant4: ACG CTA CTT ... which in mRNA would be ACG would be Thr (if CGA in DNA → CGA mRNA is Arginine, wait DNA is coding strand: ACG in DNA would be mRNA UGC, which is Cys. Wait, let me correct that:\n\nIf the DNA is 5’-ACG-3’, then the mRNA is complementary, so 5’-CGU-3’ (since mRNA is made from the template strand). So in DNA coding strand ACG would correspond to mRNA UGC (since template is complementary: DNA template is TGC, so mRNA would be complementary to that, i.e., ACG). Wait, I think I\'m getting this mixed up.\n\nWait, the advantage is antibody for DNA\'s coding strand is same as mRNA. So coding DNA: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT-3’ → mRNA is 5’-AUGUUUCUCGCU...\n\nThus, each triplet in DNA corresponds to the codon in mRNA, replacing T with U.\n\nTherefore, in mutant4\'s sequence after ATG TTT (positions4-6: TTT as before), the next triplet is ACG. So codon ACG in DNA would be mRNA UCG (since DNA\'s coding strand is ACG → mRNA is ACG). Wait no: the mRNA is made by transcribing the DNA template. If coding strand is ACG in DNA, the template strand would be complementary: TGC, so the mRNA would be complementary to the template, which is UGC (cysteine). Wait this seems like a mistake, perhaps I need to correct.\n\nWait, when given a DNA strand as coding (5\' to 3\'), the mRNA will be the same sequence with T replaced by U.\n\nBecause the coding strand\'s sequence is the same as mRNA, except T→U. The template strand is complementary.\n\nThus, if a DNA coding strand is 5\'-ACG-3\', the mRNA is 5\'-ACG-3\', changed to AUG in the previous cases. Wait no:\n\nWait first codon: DNA ATG → mRNA AUG.\n\nOther codons:\n\nOriginal codon positions7-9 DNA CTC → mRNA CUC (Leu).\n\nSo coding DNA: CTC (positions7-9) → mRNA CUC (Leu).\n\nSimilarly, Mutant4: at positions7-9, DNA ACG → mRNA ACG (if coding strand is written as ACG). Wait there\'s a mistake here. Because the DNA\'s coding strand is ACG here. If that\'s correct, then mRNA is ACG, but ACG would actually code for Threonine (Thr), codon ACG. But wait in reality, Threonine is ACN (where N is any base). So ACG is Thr. Alternatively, no, Threonine codons are: ACT, ACC, ACA, ACG. So ACG is Thr.\n\nWait the original mutation DNA from position7-9 wasCTC, now in mutant4 positions7-9: ACG. So this DNA change would result in mRNA ACG → Thr. Originally Cys maybe? Wait original codon was CUC in mRNA (Leu), now it\'s Thr. So this is a missense mutation.\n\nBut, given the mutant4\'s sequence appears to be different by having ACG there perhaps. But after that, I see similar issues, but more importantly, the main feature of Mutant4 is that some bases are missing compared to original.\n\nWait the length of the original sequence and mutant4 may differ. Looking at the sequences given in the problem:\n\nOriginal:\n\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant4:\n\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ \n\nLet\'s check if there\'s a deletion. In the original, after "ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA"\n\nMutant4 has "ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA"\n\nWait so after the initial ATG, original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT..., while mutant4 is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant4\'s sequence inserted a T and a A, or where\'s the shift? Let\'s do a base-by-base comparison:\n\nOriginal after ATG:\n\nposition4: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...\n\nPositions:\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\n11: C\n\n12: T\n\n13: G\n\n14: G\n\n15: T\n\n16: A\n\n17: C\n\n18: T\n\n19: T\n\n20: C\n\n21: T...\n\nMutant4 after ATG:\n\nposition4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T...\n\npositions:\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: A\n\n8: C\n\n9: G\n\n10: C\n\n11: T\n\n12: A\n\n13: C\n\n14: T\n\n15: T\n\n16: C\n\n17: T...\n\nSo comparing the sequences: original 7: C becomes A; 8: T becomes C; 9: C becomes G. So positions7,8,9 go from CTC to ACG. Then original positions10-12: G C T (GCT, Ala). While in mutant4, after ACG at 7-9, position10 is C followed by T, etc. But mutant4 continues with C T A C T T...; whereas original, after GCT (positions10-12: G C T) then GGT (positions13-15: G G T). In mutant4, after ACG (positions7-9), we have C T A (positions10-12: CTA), which would code for Leu. Then in position13-15: ACT (Thr) versus original\'s GGT (Gly). So this is a frameshift?\n\nWait no: inserting a different codon. But another important thing is the length. Let me count the characters. From the given sequences:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTC GCTGGTACT TCTGTGGATG AACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\n\nMutant4: ATGTTTTAC GCTACTTCT GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA \n\nWait there\'s a deletion. Comparing from the original sequence after "ATGTTTCTC GCTGGTACT TCTGTG..." the mutant4 "ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTG..." So perhaps in mutant4, there\'s a deletion of GGT? Original has GCTGGTACT while mutant4 has GCTACT.\n\nAh, yes. If we look, the original has "GCTGGTACT" (positions10-18: GCT GGT ACT) while mutant4 has "GCTACTTCT". So where the original had GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), mutant4 has GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser). So the original sequence GCTGGTACT (Ala, Gly, Thr) becomes GCTACTTCT (Ala, Thr, Ser). Comparing these, the change from GGTACT to ACTTCT. So positions13-15 in original: GGT becomes ACT (in mutant4). How did that happen? The original nucleotides: positions13-15 (GGT):\n\nOriginal - positions13: G, 14: G, 15: T.\n\nMutation 4: positions13-15: A, C, T. \n\nSo the original sequence here: GGT (positions13-15) → mutant4 ACT (positions13-15). So the two G\'s are changed to A and C at positions13 and 14. This is a complex change. But more importantly, mutant4\'s sequence results in the deletion of some nucleotides? Wait no, the sequence overall seems the same length. But perhaps a deletion has occurred here?\n\nBut in char count, original: after ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nMutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...\n\nLet me compare by basic letters:\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...\n\nMutant4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T...\n\nStarting from position4:\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...\n\nMutant4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T...\n\nThe sequences are different starting at position7. Original position7 is a C; in mutant4, it\'s an A. Original positions7: C, 8: T, 9: C → mutant4: positions7-9: A, C, G.\n\nOriginal positions10-12: G, C, T (GCT - Ala). Mutant4: C, T, A (positions10-12: C T A - CTA, which is Leu in mRNA).\n\nOriginal positions13-15: G, G, T (GGT, Gly). Mutant4: A, C, T (ACT, Thr).\n\nSo not a deletion, but substitutions. The Gly codon here is changed to a Thr, and part of the upstream sequence has changed in a way that loses some codons. However, given that protein length remains the same (each codon is three nucleotides, so just substituting one codon for another, still preserved number of amino acids albeit different ones. In this case, the protein would have a number of missense mutations but no frameshift or premature stop.\n\nSo frameshift would only happen if there is a insertion or deletion that is not a multiple of three bases. However, in Mutant4 if there\'s a deletion, it hasn\'t actually caused a shift. For example, comparing:\n\nOriginal: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...\n\nMutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT ...\n\nWait, perhaps there is deletion of GGT (positions13-15: three base pairs), so it skips 3 nucleotides, resulting in Lưu lượng. But no, from the sequence given, perhaps the sequence after \'ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...\' in the original is replaced with \'ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ...\' but the problem here I\'m getting tangled. However, the substrate may (in mutant4) have deleted some nucleotides, but not if the length is maintained. However, to actually determine a frameshift, we need a total change not divisible by three. But in Mutant4, we need to see if any deletion or insertion occurred. Let\'s count the alphabetical letters from \'ATG\' to \'TGA\' in both: the full length reamins the same? The problem mentions "mutant4: 5’- ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...", and original: "ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT..." are of the same length? \n\nThe confusing part is that if you look at the original sequence after "ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT..."\n\nand mutant4 after "ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...", we can see that in mutant4, "CTA" (GCT changed to GCT) ... Wait, turning back, perhaps there\'s a deletion of \'GGT\' causing some shift. Let\'s count:\n\nOriginal part:\n\nPositions 1-3 ATG\n\n4-6 TTT\n\n7-9 CTC\n\n10-12 GCT\n\n13-15 GGT\n\n16-18 ACT\n\nMutant4:\n\nPositions1-3 ATG\n\n4-6 TTT\n\n7-9 TAC (changed from CTC)\n\n10-12 GCT \n\n13-15 ACT (changed from original GGT)\n\n16-18 TCT (changed from original ACT codon). Wait, I\'m matching bases:\n\nFrom original: GTGGAT: after which the original has other codons.\n\nBut as it\'s tricky, perhaps better to recognize that mutation4 has altered codon sequences but no frameshift. The change from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr) and GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). Both are missense mutations, but various positions. Whether this disables the protein depends on the site. Possible but not as drastic as a premature stop.\n\nSo the current four mutants:\n\nMutant1: Phe (TTC) instead of Phe (TTT); third codon: Tyr (TAC) instead of Leu (CTC)—two missense mutations.\n\nMutant2: Phe (TTC) instead of Phe (TTT), third codon mutated to TAA (stop codon)—nonsense mutation.\n\nMutant3: A couple of missense mutations: third codon Tyr (TAC) instead of Leu (CTC), sixth codon Val instead of Thr. Might affect protein.\n\nMutant4: Multiple missense mutations, with third codon Tyr (TAC), tenth codon probably different.\n\nThe question is which mutation eliminates the anti-nutritional compound. The best candidate is Mutant2, which introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein. That would likely render the enzyme nonfunctional, thus preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nMutant1 and Mutant3 could have missense mutations, which might reduce activity but not necessarily eliminate it. Mutant4 also with missense...

The mutation in **Mutant 2** is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Analysis of Mutants:
1. **Mutant 1**  
   - **Mutation**: Silent mutation (TTT → TTC) in the second codon (Phe → Phe), and a missense mutation in the third codon (CTC → TAC, Leu → Tyr).  
   - **Impact**: A missense mutation may alter the protein structure but does not guarantee loss of function. The enzyme might retain partial activity, allowing some production of the anti-nutritional compound.

2. **Mutant 2**  
   - **Mutation**: Second codon silent (TTT → TTC, Phe → Phe) and third codon changed to **TAA** (CTC → TAA).  
   - **Impact**: TAA is a **stop codon** in mRNA (UAA). This truncates the protein after the second amino acid (Met-Phe-Stop). The severely truncated protein is nonfunctional, preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. This is a **nonsense mutation** and the strongest candidate for eliminating the compound.

3. **Mutant 3**  
   - **Mutations**: Missense mutations in the third (CTC → TAC, Leu → Tyr) and fifth (ACT → GTC, Thr → Val) codons.  
   - **Impact**: These substitutions might disrupt enzymatic activity, but the protein remains largely intact. Functional redundancy or partial activity could still allow the compound to be produced.

4. **Mutant 4**  
   - **Mutation**: Multiple missense mutations (e.g., CTC → TAC, Leu → Tyr; GGT → ACT, Gly → Thr).  
   - **Impact**: Alters several amino acids but does not cause a frameshift or premature stop. The protein may retain partial function, making it less likely to fully abolish compound synthesis.

### Conclusion:
**Mutant 2** introduces a **premature stop codon**, resulting in a severely truncated protein. This null mutation is most likely to eliminate the enzyme responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, making it the optimal choice. 

**Answer:** Mutant 2

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

i: C T C (positions 7-9). Wait, positions 7-9: C T C (CTC) in original. Now Mutant1:

Original positions 7-9: C T C → After mutation, which part changes? Let me check.

Wait, maybe the mutants differ earlier... Alternatively, there's a substitution before that.

Wait the mutant1 sequence as given is:

ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

If we count from the start:

First 3: ATG (positions 1-3)

Then next 3: TTC (positions 4-6) instead of TTT.

Then next 3: TAC (positions 7-9) instead of CTC.

Ah, so the third codon in mutant1 is TAC (Tyr) vs original CTC (Leu).

So how was this achieved? The original's third codon is CTC (positions 7-9). But in mutant1, positions 7-9 are TAC. Let's compare the DNA changes:

Original: C T C (positions7-9, which would be on coding strand, which is mRNA equivalent T C T? Wait, no, DNA is written 5' to 3'. The mRNA is complementary to the template strand, but the coding strand is the same as the mRNA but with T instead of U.

Wait, in the original DNA sequence coding strand is given as 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT..., so mRNA is AUGUUUCUCGCUGGUACU..., which would translate to Met-Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...

In Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACT...

mRNA would be AUGUUCUACGCUGGUACU...

So, codons:

Mutant1 codons: Met (AUG), Phe (UUC), Tyr (UAC), Ala (GCU), etc. So the third codon is TAC (Tyr). Original was CTC in DNA, which becomes CUC in mRNA (Leu). So in DNA, the change is from CTC to TAC. How? Let me check the actual DNA. 

Original third codon (DNA) is CTC. In mutant1, third codon is TAC. 

So first position: C→T, second T→A, third C→C? That seems like two substitutions. Wait C T C (original) becoming T A C. Wait, two mutations in the same codon. But EMS typically causes single point mutations. However, maybe that's a possibility given their collection. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the codon positions. Alternatively, maybe the mistake is elsewhere. Let me check again.

Original Sequence:

Original 5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T ACT TCT GTG GAT... 3’

Positions 7-9: nucleotides 7,8,9 are C, T, C (CTC). That's codon for Leu (CUC in mRNA codes for Leu).

Mutant1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T ... ACT TCT...

Positions 7-9 here: T, A, C. So TAC. So the original was CTC. At position7: C→T, position8: T→A, position9: C maintains. But that would require two mutations in the same codon, which is possible but less likely from EMS, which usually induces single base changes. So perhaps the alignment is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps there was a deletion in the gene in Mutant1? Wait no, the overall length seems the same; Mutant1's sequence isn't shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, but assuming it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution is CTC → TAC in DNA, meaning in the mRNA it would be from CUC (Leu) to UAC (Tyr). That's a missense mutation. So whether this affects the protein's function depends on where Leu is replaced by Tyr. If this amino acid is in the active site of the enzyme, it could disrupt function. But maybe even this isn't sufficient.

Mutant1 has two nucleotide changes (if it's CTC to TAC in DNA), which may be two point mutations. But EMS could cause each of these separately, but having two in the same codon might be less probable. However, the problem states that the collection of mutants have some changes at the beginning, maybe even multiple mutations.

But let's check the other mutants.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing:

Original starts: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT...

So original is T T T (Phe), then CTC (Leu).

Mutant2: TTC (Phe still, because position4-6: T T T → T T C? Wait, TTT to TTC: same as Mutant1's second codon. Then the third codon in Mutant2 is TAA?

Looking at the DNA sequence, after TTC in positions4-6 comes TAA (positions7-9).

Three nucleotides TAA as codon on DNA. The mRNA would be UAA, which is a stop codon. So if this is the case, the third codon in mRNA would be UAA (stop codon). That would cause premature termination of translation, leading to a truncated protein. This is a nonsense mutation. If the original gene's protein is  broken by an early stop codon, it wouldn't be functional. The product would be a short peptide, perhaps not functional for producing the anti-nutritional compound. This seems like a strong candidate for eliminating the compound. 

But let's confirm:

Original third codon (CTC in DNA, CUC in mRNA → Leu).

In mutant2, third codon in DNA is TAA.

On mRNA, that becomes UAA, which is a stop codon. So the protein would be Met (start), Phe (from TTC), then stop. This would truncate the protein right after the second amino acid. That would almost certainly disrupt the enzyme's function completely, so no anti-nutritional compound. That would be a good candidate.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original: …ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Compare:

Original sequence after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTG...

Mutant3: TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCT...

Looking at codons:

Original: first codon after ATG (TTT), which is Phe. Then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc.

Mutant3: after ATG, TTT (Phe), then TAC (Tyr, which in DNA is TAC, so mRNA UAC), then GCT, GGT GTC ACT... 

Wait, need to check the mutation in the exon. Are these insertions or substitutions? Let's see precisely where the mutations are.

Original starts with:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So at positions 7-9, original CTC becomes TAC. That's two changes (C→T and T→A in positions7-8, with original C T C, mutant T A C. So then mRNA would be TAC (DNA) so mRNA UAC (Tyr) instead of CUC (Leu). Missense mutation. Then next codon, GGT (Gly) in original becomes GTC (Val) in mutant3. How?

Original coding for that codon (positions10-12) is GCT (Ala). Wait, perhaps need to recount:

Original exon sequence:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Second codon: TTT (F)

Third: CTC (L)

Fourth: GCT (A)

Fifth: GGT (G)

Sixth: ACT (T)

Seventh: TCT (S)

Then in mutant3:

After TTT, we have TAC (third codon instead of CTC), then GCT (A: same as original). Then GGT stays, but the next codon in original is ACT (T), but mutant3 has GTC: wait let's see.

Wait in the Mutant3 sequence given:

...GGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT... So in the sequence GGTGTCACT.

Original: GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT (GGT = positions X-X, then ACT, etc.)

Mutant3's sequence: GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So original fifth codon: ACT (Thr) in positions, let's say, 16-18 (but depends on exact numbering) and mutant3 changes that to GTC (Val) in the codon where it was ACT. Wait, how? Original ACT is Threonine. To become GTC (Val), how did the DNA change? Original ACT would be DNA ACT, mRNA ACU (Thr). Mutant's codon is GTC in DNA, which is mRNA GUC (Val). So in the DNA, A in position 1 of the codon (of its position) changed to G. Since EMS typically causes GC to AT transitions (G to A or C to T). But this mutation is an A to G transition. Wait, is that possible?

EMS typically alkylates guanine, which pairs with T, leading to GC→AT transition. But here, if the original is A (in ACT codon), changing to G would require a transition from A to G, which can happen from EMS if the original was a purine (A or G). Wait EMS is more likely to cause transitions in Gs. However, there's also the possibility that during replication, the alkylated G pairs with T, leading to a G:C → A:T mutation.

Wait, but other mutagens may cause different mutations. However, in the problem, we just know that EMS was used. So the mutation from A→G would not be typical of EMS. But perhaps this is a rare mutation, but I'll note that. Regardless, let's focus on the impact. So in mutant3, the fifth codon (ACT in original DNA → GTC in mutant DNA) leads to mRNA codon GUC (Val) instead of ACU (Thr). This is a missense mutation. Plus, there's another change at the third codon (original CTC → TAC). So two amino acid substitutions here. Might this affect the enzyme's function? It depends, but if those positions are critical, maybe. But without knowing the enzyme's structure, it's hard. However, whether it's worse than a nonsense mutation?

Mutant4:5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ 

Original sequence: ...ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Comparison: let's look at the start:

Original after ATG: TTTCTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant4 after ATG: TTTACGCTACTTCT...

So substituting some parts and perhaps a deletion. Let's see:

Original DNA from position 4: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T...

Wait, perhaps the mutant4 has a deletion. Let's count the bases. Original starts with:

ATG (3) TTT (3) CTC (3) GCT (3) GGT (3) ACT (3) TCT (3)... (Total so far: 3+3+3+3+3+3=18 bases).

Mutant4: 

ATG (3) T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G A T... 

Wait, in the original, from position 4 onwards: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant4 from position4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T...

It looks like there's missing sequence. Specifically, original has after TTT, the next is CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... whereas mutant4 after TTT becomes ACGCTACTTCT...

Wait comparing:

Original: after TTT (positions4-6: F), then positions7-9: CTC (L), 10-12: GCT (A), 13-15: GGT (G), 16-18: ACT (T), 19-21: TCT (S).

Mutant4: after TTT (positions4-6), then positions7-9: ACG (Thr?), then 10-12: CTA (Leu?), then 13-15: CTT (Leu?), and on. Wait, maybe it's better to write step by step:

Original and Mutant4:

Original sequences:
Positions Start: 1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT...

Mutant4 sequence after ATG:
Positions4-6: TTT
Then positions7-9: ACG
10-12: CTA
13-15: CTT...

Comparing the coding:

Original from positions7-18: CTC GCT GGT ACT (Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr)

Mutant4: ACG CTA CTT ... which in mRNA would be ACG would be Thr (if CGA in DNA → CGA mRNA is Arginine, wait DNA is coding strand: ACG in DNA would be mRNA UGC, which is Cys. Wait, let me correct that:

If the DNA is 5’-ACG-3’, then the mRNA is complementary, so 5’-CGU-3’ (since mRNA is made from the template strand). So in DNA coding strand ACG would correspond to mRNA UGC (since template is complementary: DNA template is TGC, so mRNA would be complementary to that, i.e., ACG). Wait, I think I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, the advantage is antibody for DNA's coding strand is same as mRNA. So coding DNA: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT-3’ → mRNA is 5’-AUGUUUCUCGCU...

Thus, each triplet in DNA corresponds to the codon in mRNA, replacing T with U.

Therefore, in mutant4's sequence after ATG TTT (positions4-6: TTT as before), the next triplet is ACG. So codon ACG in DNA would be mRNA UCG (since DNA's coding strand is ACG → mRNA is ACG). Wait no: the mRNA is made by transcribing the DNA template. If coding strand is ACG in DNA, the template strand would be complementary: TGC, so the mRNA would be complementary to the template, which is UGC (cysteine). Wait this seems like a mistake, perhaps I need to correct.

Wait, when given a DNA strand as coding (5' to 3'), the mRNA will be the same sequence with T replaced by U.

Because the coding strand's sequence is the same as mRNA, except T→U. The template strand is complementary.

Thus, if a DNA coding strand is 5'-ACG-3', the mRNA is 5'-ACG-3', changed to AUG in the previous cases. Wait no:

Wait first codon: DNA ATG → mRNA AUG.

Other codons:

Original codon positions7-9 DNA CTC → mRNA CUC (Leu).

So coding DNA: CTC (positions7-9) → mRNA CUC (Leu).

Similarly, Mutant4: at positions7-9, DNA ACG → mRNA ACG (if coding strand is written as ACG). Wait there's a mistake here. Because the DNA's coding strand is ACG here. If that's correct, then mRNA is ACG, but ACG would actually code for Threonine (Thr), codon ACG. But wait in reality, Threonine is ACN (where N is any base). So ACG is Thr. Alternatively, no, Threonine codons are: ACT, ACC, ACA, ACG. So ACG is Thr.

Wait the original mutation DNA from position7-9 wasCTC, now in mutant4 positions7-9: ACG. So this DNA change would result in mRNA ACG → Thr. Originally Cys maybe? Wait original codon was CUC in mRNA (Leu), now it's Thr. So this is a missense mutation.

But, given the mutant4's sequence appears to be different by having ACG there perhaps. But after that, I see similar issues, but more importantly, the main feature of Mutant4 is that some bases are missing compared to original.

Wait the length of the original sequence and mutant4 may differ. Looking at the sequences given in the problem:

Original:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ 

Let's check if there's a deletion. In the original, after "ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA"

Mutant4 has "ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA"

Wait so after the initial ATG, original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT..., while mutant4 is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Mutant4's sequence inserted a T and a A, or where's the shift? Let's do a base-by-base comparison:

Original after ATG:

position4: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Positions:

4: T

5: T

6: T

7: C

8: T

9: C

10: G

11: C

12: T

13: G

14: G

15: T

16: A

17: C

18: T

19: T

20: C

21: T...

Mutant4 after ATG:

position4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T...

positions:

4: T

5: T

6: T

7: A

8: C

9: G

10: C

11: T

12: A

13: C

14: T

15: T

16: C

17: T...

So comparing the sequences: original 7: C becomes A; 8: T becomes C; 9: C becomes G. So positions7,8,9 go from CTC to ACG. Then original positions10-12: G C T (GCT, Ala). While in mutant4, after ACG at 7-9, position10 is C followed by T, etc. But mutant4 continues with C T A C T T...; whereas original, after GCT (positions10-12: G C T) then GGT (positions13-15: G G T). In mutant4, after ACG (positions7-9), we have C T A (positions10-12: CTA), which would code for Leu. Then in position13-15: ACT (Thr) versus original's GGT (Gly). So this is a frameshift?

Wait no: inserting a different codon. But another important thing is the length. Let me count the characters. From the given sequences:

Original: ATGTTTCTC GCTGGTACT TCTGTGGATG AACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant4: ATGTTTTAC GCTACTTCT GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA 

Wait there's a deletion. Comparing from the original sequence after "ATGTTTCTC GCTGGTACT TCTGTG..." the mutant4 "ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTG..." So perhaps in mutant4, there's a deletion of GGT? Original has GCTGGTACT while mutant4 has GCTACT.

Ah, yes. If we look, the original has "GCTGGTACT" (positions10-18: GCT GGT ACT) while mutant4 has "GCTACTTCT". So where the original had GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), mutant4 has GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser). So the original sequence GCTGGTACT (Ala, Gly, Thr) becomes GCTACTTCT (Ala, Thr, Ser). Comparing these, the change from GGTACT to ACTTCT. So positions13-15 in original: GGT becomes ACT (in mutant4). How did that happen? The original nucleotides: positions13-15 (GGT):

Original - positions13: G, 14: G, 15: T.

Mutation 4: positions13-15: A, C, T. 

So the original sequence here: GGT (positions13-15) → mutant4 ACT (positions13-15). So the two G's are changed to A and C at positions13 and 14. This is a complex change. But more importantly, mutant4's sequence results in the deletion of some nucleotides? Wait no, the sequence overall seems the same length. But perhaps a deletion has occurred here?

But in char count, original: after ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGG...

Let me compare by basic letters:

Original: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T...

Starting from position4:

Original: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T...

Mutant4: T T T A C G C T A C T T C T...

The sequences are different starting at position7. Original position7 is a C; in mutant4, it's an A. Original positions7: C, 8: T, 9: C → mutant4: positions7-9: A, C, G.

Original positions10-12: G, C, T (GCT - Ala). Mutant4: C, T, A (positions10-12: C T A - CTA, which is Leu in mRNA).

Original positions13-15: G, G, T (GGT, Gly). Mutant4: A, C, T (ACT, Thr).

So not a deletion, but substitutions. The Gly codon here is changed to a Thr, and part of the upstream sequence has changed in a way that loses some codons. However, given that protein length remains the same (each codon is three nucleotides, so just substituting one codon for another, still preserved number of amino acids albeit different ones. In this case, the protein would have a number of missense mutations but no frameshift or premature stop.

So frameshift would only happen if there is a insertion or deletion that is not a multiple of three bases. However, in Mutant4 if there's a deletion, it hasn't actually caused a shift. For example, comparing:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT ...

Wait, perhaps there is deletion of GGT (positions13-15: three base pairs), so it skips 3 nucleotides, resulting in Lưu lượng. But no, from the sequence given, perhaps the sequence after 'ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ...' in the original is replaced with 'ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT ...' but the problem here I'm getting tangled. However, the substrate may (in mutant4) have deleted some nucleotides, but not if the length is maintained. However, to actually determine a frameshift, we need a total change not divisible by three. But in Mutant4, we need to see if any deletion or insertion occurred. Let's count the alphabetical letters from 'ATG' to 'TGA' in both: the full length reamins the same? The problem mentions "mutant4: 5’- ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...", and original: "ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT..." are of the same length? 

The confusing part is that if you look at the original sequence after "ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT..."

and mutant4 after "ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...", we can see that in mutant4, "CTA" (GCT changed to GCT) ... Wait, turning back, perhaps there's a deletion of 'GGT' causing some shift. Let's count:

Original part:

Positions 1-3 ATG

4-6 TTT

7-9 CTC

10-12 GCT

13-15 GGT

16-18 ACT

Mutant4:

Positions1-3 ATG

4-6 TTT

7-9 TAC (changed from CTC)

10-12 GCT 

13-15 ACT (changed from original GGT)

16-18 TCT (changed from original ACT codon). Wait, I'm matching bases:

From original: GTGGAT: after which the original has other codons.

But as it's tricky, perhaps better to recognize that mutation4 has altered codon sequences but no frameshift. The change from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr) and GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). Both are missense mutations, but various positions. Whether this disables the protein depends on the site. Possible but not as drastic as a premature stop.

So the current four mutants:

Mutant1: Phe (TTC) instead of Phe (TTT); third codon: Tyr (TAC) instead of Leu (CTC)—two missense mutations.

Mutant2: Phe (TTC) instead of Phe (TTT), third codon mutated to TAA (stop codon)—nonsense mutation.

Mutant3: A couple of missense mutations: third codon Tyr (TAC) instead of Leu (CTC), sixth codon Val instead of Thr. Might affect protein.

Mutant4: Multiple missense mutations, with third codon Tyr (TAC), tenth codon probably different.

The question is which mutation eliminates the anti-nutritional compound. The best candidate is Mutant2, which introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein. That would likely render the enzyme nonfunctional, thus preventing synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

Mutant1 and Mutant3 could have missense mutations, which might reduce activity but not necessarily eliminate it. Mutant4 also with missense... Mut.2's nonsense seems most certain to disrupt production.

Let\'s check:\n\nOriginal 3rd codon is CTC: cytosine, thymine, cytosine → actually, DNA is written 5\'-CTC-3\' (remember the direction), so complementary mRNA would be GAG (since DNA is non-coding strand), but if the gene\'s coding strand is the opposite, perhaps the listed DNA sequence is the coding strand. This can be confusing. \n\nWait, the DNA strand given here is 5\' to 3\' of the coding strand. Because for genes, the mRNA is transcribed from the template (non-coding) strand, which is complementary to the coding strand.

Wait wait the first codon is ATG (positions 1-3). Then next codon is positions 4-6. Original sequence:\n\nATG (1-3), then the next triplet would be TTC (4-6), T C the next few. Wait perhaps the original sequence\'s first exon is:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA.\n\nNow that is separated into codons as:\n\nATG (1-3), then TTT (4-6), then CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), etc.\n\nMutant 1:\n\nATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA.\n\nComparing:\n\nOriginal (codons): 1: ATG, 2: TTT, 3: CTC, 4: GCT...\n\nMutant1 codons: 1: ATG, 2: TTC, 3: TAC, 4: GCT...\n\nSo the original CT in codon3 (CTC) becomes TA (TAC). How is that possible? The third codon in the original is positions 7-9: CTC. In mutant1, it\'s TAC. So there\'s a T → T (position7?), wait:\n\nIf original codon3: positions7-9: CTC (C is position7? Let me check:\n\nWait each codon is triplet over positions:\n\n1-3: ATG\n\n4-6: TTT [positions 4-6: but T\'s letters are: positions 4,5,6: TTT (original fourth codon next is 7,8,9: CTC (Leu in original). But in Mutant1:\n\nATG TTC TAC GCT ... So replacing TTT (positions4-6) in original with TTC (same amino acid), and CTC positions7-9 in original with TAC. So perhaps this is a substitution at positions7 and 8? Wait original position7: C (C), T, C.\n\nOriginal CTC (codon3), codon3 in mutant1 is TAC. How? Let\'s map the specific mutations:\n\nOriginal: after ATG: T-T-T-C-T-C… (position4–9)\n\nMutant1: T-T-C-T-A-C (positions4-9). \n\nWait, original positions4: T, 5: T, 6: T (codon2: TTT). But mutant1 in codon2: TTC (positions4,5:TT, position6: C?) So, codon2 changes from TTT (Phe) to TTC (Phe), which is a silent mutation.\n\nMoving beyond that, original positions7-9: C T C → coding for Leu (CTC). In mutant1, positions7-9 are T A C, which makes codon3: TAC (Tyr). But how did this substitution happen? If nucleotides in positions7-9 changed from CTC to TAC, that requires a C→T at position7 (first base of codon3, resulting in TTC?), perhaps another mutation. \n\nAlternatively, but this might indicate a frameshift if there was an insertion or deletion, another mutational process. However, MMS tends to cause point mutations, not insertions/deletions, which are more common with other mutagens like radiation.\n\nBut looking at Mutant 1 and original, the length seems the same. So maybe two point mutations: T→T (no change), but perhaps other positions. Alternatively, maybe there\'s a confusion about how the codons are being changed. Alternatively, perhaps the alignment is wrong. Alternatively, think of Mutant1 as having two point mutations:\n\nFrom original triplet positions4-6 TTT (Phe) changed to TTC (Phe), silent. Then in the next codon positions7-9 CTC (Leu) changed to TAC (Tyr). \n\nWait that requires a C→T at position7 (from original C to T in mutant), making first base of codon3 as T, so altering CTC to TTC? But in mutant1 it\'s TAC. Hmm, perhaps I\'m missing something. If original DNA in 7-9: CTC (so on coding strand), mRNA will be CUA (but mRNA is complementary to the DNA\'s template strand. Wait, if the DNA is coding the same as mRNA, then in coding strand DNA, CTC is Leu. However, mRNA is CUG possibly. Not sure, but given this is the coding strand, then yes. So maybe mutant1 changes nucleotides in positions... For example, mutation in position x causes a substitution in codon3, leading to Leu→Tyr. \n\nIf the codon for Leu (CTC) mutates to TAC (Tyr), this is a missense mutation. However, since the anti-nutritional compound\'s gene product needs to be functional for the compound to be produced, changing an amino acid could reduce the enzyme\'s activity. However, whether it sufficiently inactivates the enzyme is unknown. Another mutation in the same mutant could be at another position. For example, notice that the next codon in original CGT (Arg) in position 15 becomes CGC (Arg), which is a  silent mutation at position x. So, perhaps Mutant1 has two silent mutations (TTC for Phe and CGC for Arg) and the codon3 CTC→TAC (Leu→Tyr). Only one amino acid change here. If that\'s a critical residue, it might affect enzyme function, but this is speculative. So might not completely knock out the enzyme; could lead to reduced production. But without knowing the enzyme\'s structure, hard to say, but frame shifts or stop codons are more likely to eliminate function.\n\nMutant 2:\n\nOriginal: ATG T T T CTC GCT ... Mutant2: ATG T T C TA A GCT ... Let\'s examine Mutant2\'s DNA:\n\nMutant 2:\n5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nBreaking into codons after ATG:\n\nTTA AGC ...? Let\'s do this step-by-step:\n\nCodon break after ATG (position1-3):\n\nOriginal codon positions:\n\n1-3:ATG, 4-6: TTT,7-9:CTC,10-12:GCT, etc.\n\nMutant2:\n\nATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ... \n\nCodon1: ATG (same)\nCodon2: TTC (Phe) same as Mutant1.\nCodon3: TAA (vs original CTC)\nSo original codon3 is Leu (CTC), but mutant3 codon3 is TAA, which is a stop codon. So that would introduce a premature stop codon at codon3, leading to truncated protein. This is a nonsense mutation. If this is the case, Mutant2 has a nonsense mutation in codon3 (early in the gene), causing translation to stop prematurely. This would likely render the gene product nonfunctional, thus preventing the anti-nutritional compound\'s synthesis. So Mutant2 seems promising. Let\'s check this. \n\nOriginal codon3: CTC (Leu). In original DNA sequence, positions7-9: C T C. If Mutant2\'s positions7-9 are T A A, then substitution of C→T at position7 and T→A at position8 and C→A at position9? Wait, mutiple point mutations? Or possibly what\'s the mutation. \n\nWait, Mutant2\'s third codon (positions7-9):\n\nOriginal CTC → TAA?\n\nLooking at the original sequence and mutant2 at codon3:\n\nOriginal: CT C (positions 7-9? Let me count DNA characters. \n\nOriginal gene:\n\nPositions:\n\n1-3: ATG  \n4-6: TTT  \n7-9: CTC  \n10-12: GCT  \n12-15: ..., etc.\n\nMutant2\'s DNA around third codon:\n\nATG TTC TAA GCT ... So, after first codon ATG, the second is TTC (positions4-6: T T C → so in original, second codon was T T T). Then third codons in mutant2 is TAA. Then fourth codon GCT (Ala), same as original.\n\nOriginal\'s third codon was CTC (Leu) at positions7-9. To get TAA here, in mutant2:\n\npositions7: C→T (reverse is impossible?), positions8: T→A, positions9: C→A? EMS is typically point mutations causing replacement of G to A. Wait, perhaps only one nucleotide changed? Let me check the actual DNA sequence:\n\nOriginal DNA fragment for codons/exons:\n\n5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T ...-3’\n\nMutant 2\'s DNA:\n\n5’-ATG T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T ...-3’\n\nSo from the original’s T T T (codon2), now T T C (no amino acid change), then the following nucleotides: after T T T T C in original or in mutant?\n\nAlternatively, let\'s match the exact sequencing:\n\nOriginal first part:\n\nATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T ... \n\nMutant1’s code after the first few nucleotides: ATG T T C T A C G C T ... (probably);\n\nBut for mutant2: the sequence is ATG T T C T A A G C T ... So comparing the original (which was ATG T T T C T C G C T ...), while Mutant2 has TTC (second codon) and then T A A next. So the original nucleotides after second codon were C T C (positions7-9), and this becomes T A A in mutant2. So replacing positions7-9 (CTC) with TAA. Let\'s break that down:\n\nOriginal nucleotide at position7: C → T in mutant2.\n\nPosition8: T → A.\n\nPosition9: C → A. \n\nThis would require two point mutations (positions7 and 8 or 8 and9?), but EMS usually causes single nucleotide changes. It\'s possible, perhaps, that there was a deletion, which causes frameshifting. Let\'s check the exact mutation.\n\nBut looking purely at the given sequences:\n\nOriginal first exon fragment:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nMutant2:\n\nATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nUnderline the changes: compare to original:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA\nMutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…\n\nMark differences:\n\nPositions:\n\nOriginal: index=4 (T), but sequence starts count at 1: may vary, but let\'s compare positionally.\n\nAt positions overlapping:\n\nOriginal \n\n... at the start, first differs at the 5th nucleotide:\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C...\n\nMutant2: T T C T A A...\n\nWait, original codon2 is TTT (positions4-6), mutant2 has TTC (codon2). Then original codon3 is CT-C, so DNA sequence following after codon2 is CTCT ... perhaps.\n\nWait better to write side by side:\n\nOriginal:\n\n5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T ACT... (and so on)\n\nMutant2:\n\n5’-ATG T T C T A A G C T G G T ACT...\n\nSo, this mutation replaces three nucleotides in the original (the third codon):\n\nOriginal C T C (positions7-9: C in 7, T in8, C in9), becomes T A A in positions7-9 (Mutant2: CTAAGCT? Let\'s actual and mutant indexing:\n\nOriginal after ATG TTT: C T C G C T G G….\n\nMutant2 after ATG TTC: T A A G C T G G ….\n\nSo between, three nucleotides:\n\nOriginal had CTC (positions7-9?), while mutant2 has TAA here.\n\nThat would require three changes:\n\n- C→T (position7)\n- T→A (position8)\n- C→A (position9)\n\nBut having three mutations in such proximity is very unlikely, given that EMS causes point mutations randomly. Therefore, this can\'t be three simultaneous mutations, which would be improbable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original and mutant are shifted somehow. Wait, is there an insertion or deletion causing a frameshift? Let\'s check:\n\nMutant3 and Mutant4 also vary, but here comparing mutant 2, let\'s check length.\n\nMutant2 seems to have the same number of nucleotides in this segment because there are no apparent insertions or deletions. If so, three point mutations in neighboring nucleotides are unlikely, but the change could happen via a double mutation. EMS can cause multiple mutations, but it\'s rare. \n\nIf we accept the sequence as given, mutant2 introduces a TAA stop codon in the third codon. This would terminate translation after the second codon (since the third codon is now a stop codon). However, position3 is the third codon. So if the sequence after ATG reads TTC, then TAA, this would be:\n\nProtein sequence: Met (ATG), Phe (TTC), then Stop (TAA) codon. This would truncate the protein after the second amino acid, making it non-functional, thus preventing the anti-nutritional compound\'s production. If that\'s accurate, Mutant2 would be a good candidate. Thus, introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) early would eliminate the protein product potentially.\n\nSo Mutant2 (sequence leading to TAA stop codon third position) is likely the best candidate. \n\nOther mutants: \n\nMutant3: has an insertion? The sequence length is longer. Looking at Mutant3\'s DNA:\n\nMutant3:\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nCompare with original:\n\nOriginal: …CTGGTACTTCTGTG…\n\nMutant3: …CTGGTGTCACTTCTGTG…\n\nExamining the sequences: around the fourth or fifth codon. Possibly an insertion of "TGTA" or similar, which might cause a frameshift. Let\'s look at the difference:\n\nOriginal\'s 5\'-GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT…-3\'\n\nMutant3\'s 5\'-GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT… \n\nWait in the original:\n\nGGT (positions10-12: Gly), ACT (Thr, maybe positions13-15), TCT (Ser), etc.\n\nIn Mutant3, the sequences after GGT becomes GTC ACT...\n\nSo original: GGT ACT TCT → (Gly, Thr, Ser)\n\nMutant3: GGT GTC ACT TCT → expanded? What is the change in codons.\n\nIt\'s possible that there\'s an insertion of a base? Let\'s count nucleotides.\n\nOriginal sequence in the area in question:\n\nCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT… which breaks to CTG GTA CTT CTG TGG ...\n\nBut better to split original into codons after mutation. Alternate approach: look for inserted or deleted bases. How does mutant3 differ in length?\n\nOriginal: …CTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT… length perhaps varies: the wildtype hasn\'t an extra sequence. Mutant3 text has "ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’"\n\nOriginal\'s exons start with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... versus Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...\n\nComparing specific positions:\n\nAfter ATG, the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG …\n\nMutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG …\n\nSo, the difference: original sixth codon ACT (Thr) is replaced by GTC (Val)? Wait, more accurately:\n\nOriginal has the codon sequence:\n\nTTT (4-6)\nCTC (7-9)\nGCT (10-12)\nGGT (13-15)\nACT (16-18)\n\nMutant3’s codons after ATG are:\n\nTTT (4-6)\nTAC (7-9)\nGCT (10-12)\nGGT (13-15)\nGTC (16-18)\nACT (19-21)\n\nSo in Mutant3, between GGT and ACT (original after GGT by positions?), thirdly, additional nucleotides causing an insertion? Alternatively, codons after GGT (position13-15). Original sequence after GGT_ ACT_TCT. Mutant3: GTG TC_ ACT. This seems a possible insertion of two nucleotides, which would cause a frameshift. \n\nBut actually，seeing：\n\nOriginal sequence: GGT ACT TCT → amino acids: Gly, Thr, Ser.\n\nMutant3 after GGT becomes GTC ACT TCT → which would imply:\n\nAmino acids GGT (Gly) retained. Then codons GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser). \n\nComparing to original after GGT, mutant3\'s sequence inserts GTC between GGT and ACT. This can\'t be a frameshift (adding three nucleotides would insert one extra amino acid). If a triplet is inserted, adding one amino acid (Val) letting the last code read ACT (Thr). But then just inserting a codon. But in that case, the open reading frame remains, but with an extra amino acid (Val). Are the extra nucleotides present? Alternatively, original\'s GGT ACT TCT (codon5: GGT Gly, ACT Thr, TCT Ser) becomes GGT GTC ACT TCT. That implies a insertion of GTC, but adding incomplete triplet? Part of the problem here is doubt about how one actually parses the sequences; possibly a portion is misaligned. \n\nAlternatively, the mutant3\'s DNA might have had a duplication or an added base. Noticing after GCTGG... maybe the DNA has:\n\nOriginal: GCTGGTACT... → GCT GGT ACT...\n\nMutant3： GCTGGTGTCACT... → GCT GGT GTC ACT...\n\nSo here, after GCT (original codon), then GGT (original # Gly), then ORIGINALLY ACT (codons 6,7, maybe. Wait how to parse.\n\nOriginal _GCTGGTACTTCT_: GCT (codon4, 10-12),GGT (13-15,codon5) ACT (16-18,codon6), TCT (19-21,codon7)\n\nMutant3: GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT... therefore, inserting GTC between GGT and ACT. This implies insertion of GTC tri dénouement: thus, the mutant3 has an insertion of three nucleotides (thus coding for Val (GTC)) between codon5 and codon6. This would be an in-frame insertion, adding an additional amino acid (Val) but preserving the rest of the reading frame. Thus, the resulting protein would have an extra valine residue between what was codon5 (GGT, Gly) and codon6 (ACT, Thr) in the original.\n\nThis is a inframe insertion, so it inserts an extra amino acid but doesn\'t change the rest of the frame. Depending on where this occurs, it might disrupt a crucial active site, but due to EMS causing mainly point mutations, a three-nucleotide insertion (3 GTA) for instance. But EMS doesn\'t typically cause insertions. Insertions are more often caused by other mutagens. So possibly, Mutant3 has a **duplication** of a codon? Or a point mutation leading to a substitution. Wait looking back, another possibility. Comparing Original to Mutant3 in which parts:\n\nMutant3 might have a point mutation that causes altered nucleotides, altering subsequent codons. For example, in Original, after GCT (codon10-12) comes GGT (positions13-15, codon5?), then ACT (codonde titten 16-18; Thr). Mutant3 may have:\n\n GGT GTC ACT\n\nThis would be changing ACT (codon6,16-18) but with inserted GTC. Alternatively, the codon layout may be misaligned. If EMS causes a transversion altering few nucleotides, leading to a different sequence but maintaining the same number of nucleotides, so possible in-frame mutations but with additional a to a pre-existing codon. Acqprovoking a "GTC" replacing some existing codons. However, perhaps there\'s an error in reading this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Mutant3 has a point mutation that turned a nucleotide further downstream but showed up in their sequence here? For example::\n\nOriginal codon5： GGT (positions13-15, Gly)→ but in Mutant3, attach after GGT a GTC.\n\nAlternatively, let me pin down exact sequences. Oir original sequence beginning:\n\n5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...-3’\n\nMutant 3:\n\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...-3’\n\nComparing sequentially:\n\nOriginal: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C...\n\nMutant3: ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T... \n\nSo highlighting the differences: position4: Original T, mutant3 position4: an extra T, causing a shift? Wait no:\n\nPosition analysis would follow:\n\nOriginal nucleotides (index starts after IGN, first three are ATG):\n4 T,5 T,6 T (, TTT) (second codon: Phe)\n7 C,8 T,9 C (third codon: Leu)\n10 G,11 C,12 T (fourth codon: Ala?, Which is GCT)\n13 G,14 G,15 T (fifth codon: GGT, Gly)\n16 A,17 C,18 T (sixth codon: ACT, Thr)\n...\n\nMutant3:\n\n4 T,5 T,6 T (TTT) [codon2: Phe]\n7 T (instead of C),8 A,9 C (codon3 mutated from CTC→TAC,... but perhaps not possible?)\n\nWait the mutant3 has T T T T A C G C T..., possible inserts:\n\nATG T T T T A C G C T ... ( positions 4: T, 5: T, 6: T, 7: T, tạo codon 2 và 3 như thần thế tỷ. It could cause a frameshift? Because if there\'s an additional T at position7, then the reading frameshifts. For example:\n\nAssume original have after ATG:TT-TCTCGT..., but mutant3 now has after ATG:TT-TTT-ACG..., if that\'s the case, it\'s inserting an extra T. Let\'s see:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTTCTC..., which as three nucleotides for codon2: TTT, and CTC...\n\nMutant3: ATG TTTTAC..., codons would be TTT, TAC——HERE FEEL. \n\nWait, TTTTAC could be read as TTT followed by TAC. So codon2: TTT (Phe), codon3: TAC (Tyr). Thus no frameshift but a substitution with the third codon.\n\nThis gives us substitution in codon3 from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr) with a mutated base. Such missense mutations. Bit happens here? However, in the dna sequences, this regiomen may involve inserting a nucleotide. Wait confusion arises from comparing sequences correctly. Alternatively, the DNA aligns as follows, showed here:\n\nOriginal codion3：\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGT...\n\nMutant3\'s:ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTC...\n\nbrekdown:\n\nOriginal:\n\ncodgo: 1: ATG, 2: TTT,3:CTC,4: GCT,5: GGT...\n\nMutant3: ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT,GGT,...\n\nBut to check if it\'s an insertion, Are the later codons shifted? \n\nIn original codon5 is GGT (Gly,positions13-15)，ACT (codon6 positions16-18).\n\nIn Mutant3, for example, later in sequence, before TCT, we seeGTGTC:\n\nIn mutant3\'s code here... GGTGTCACT. So this suggests GGT GTC ACT joined. So codons:\n\n12-15: GGT\n\n15-18? (depending where we start) But perhaps transforming codon5 from GGT to something else. It\'s getting complicated, but the key point is:\n\nDoes mutant3 have vanished or shifted codons intendantarly analyzed. Importantly though,Mutant3 may show altered sequence caused by an insert or other point mutations leading to different amino.adds. \n\nHowever, Mutant3\'s key feature beyond códons 2-3 change (äänäuction to Tyr)，as well as perhaps a frameshift from an insertion. \n\nAlternatively, inquiry ill-founded.\n\nBut assuming the \'TGGT\' part in mutant34 is mutated to \'TGTC\', which affects neighboring codons. Alternatively, perhaps Mutant3 has a deletion instead, truncating the chain.\n\nDue to Mutation3\'s way of presentation in the text, which could have a triplet inserted. But given the consent.ion here, method; if the question is about selecting the monoition that Milosh elucidate the gene function, the Oblate with a premature replaced codμtation #2\'s TAA-stop codon Inducing a premature termination would likely eb the best candidateol.\n\nNow for Mutant4:\n\nMutant4 DNA sequence:5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ \n\nCompare to original:\n\nOriginal： ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA’\n\nMutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA’\n\n noting the missing nucleotides.Let\'s breakdown:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... \n\nMutant4： ATG T T T TAC GC T Acta ct..

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the given mutants for potential disruptions in the gene responsible for synthesizing the compound. The key mutations considered are those that would render the gene product nonfunctional, such as nonsense mutations (introducing a premature stop codon) or frameshift mutations (disrupting the reading frame).

1. **Mutant 1**: 
   - Changes the third codon from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), a missense mutation. This is unlikely to completely disable the enzyme.
   - No frameshift or premature stop codon.

2. **Mutant 2**: 
   - Introduces a TAA stop codon in the third codon. The original codon CTC (Leu) becomes TAA (stop), leading to a truncated protein. This is a nonsense mutation which likely results in a nonfunctional protein.

3. **Mutant 3**: 
   - Contains an insertion of "TGT" leading to an in-frame addition of Valine (GTC). This is a missense mutation which might not completely disable the enzyme.

4. **Mutant 4**: 
   - Shows a deletion of nucleotides, potentially leading to a frameshift mutation. However, detailed analysis suggests this deletion might not sufficiently disrupt the reading frame. 

Among these, **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon early in the gene (third codon), which is most likely to eliminate the production of the anti-nutritional compound by truncating the protein and rendering it nonfunctional.

### Final Answer
Mutant 2 will most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar. The mutation is \boxed{Mutant 2}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

 Another change is found at position 10: Original sequence shows T in the third codon (CTT), but mutant 1 has TCT -> TAC. Wait, maybe I need to break down the codon position correctly.

Wait, perhaps better to list the codons from the original and mutants. Let's re-express the DNA sequences as codons.

Original start:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Original codon conversion:

Met - Phe - Leu - Ala - Gly - Thr - Ser - Val - Asp - Glu - His - Ile - Tyr - Cys - Arg ... Stop

Mutant 1 changes: appears to have a deletion? Let me check the sequence again. The original is:

Original DNA: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1 DNA: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

So the differences are:

Original 2nd codon: TTT → TTC (Phe → same)

Original 3rd codon: CTC → TAC → this part might be because maybe the position shifted? Wait, maybe there's a deletion or insertion? Let me align the mutant and original.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

So in the original, codon positions (3rd nucleotide after each):
Positions 4-6: TCT, next positions...

Wait, arranging each codon (3 nucleotides):

Original:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. CTC (Leu)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
11. CAT (His)
12. ATT (Ile)
13. TAT (Tyr)
14. TGT (Cys)
15. CGT (Arg)
Then rest...TGA is the stop.

Mutant1:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTC (Phe) - 3rd position changed from T to C. Same amino acid; silent mutation.
3. TAC (Tyr) → Originally third codon was CTC (Leu), so replacing T with C in third position? Wait perhaps there's a substitution at the second nucleotide. Let's check:

Original 3rd codon is CTC: cytosine, thymine, cytosine → actually, DNA is written 5'-CTC-3' (remember the direction), so complementary mRNA would be GAG (since DNA is non-coding strand), but if the gene's coding strand is the opposite, perhaps the listed DNA sequence is the coding strand. This can be confusing. 

Wait, the DNA strand given here is 5' to 3' of the coding strand. Because for genes, the mRNA is transcribed from the template (non-coding) strand, which is complementary to the coding strand. To clarify, the listed DNA sequence is in the same direction as mRNA (with T instead of U). So the original DNA sequence is the coding strand (matches mRNA). So codons would translate as written here. So original CTC (Ctc codon?) Wait, unless the DNA strand has been given as template strand, which would require converting to mRNA. Hmm, this could be a possible confusion. Let me clarify:

If the DNA is written in 5' → 3' direction (as is standard) and it's the coding (sense) strand, meaning it's the same as mRNA except T for U. So codons can be read directly. So original third codon is CAA? Wait the original sequence starts with ATG (which is start). Then TTT, then CTC (second codon? Let me recheck:

Wait, the original sequence initial part is: ATG TTT CTC GCT...

Breaking down every three nucleotides:

1. ATG (start)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. CTA (because After ATG is TTT (positions 4:TT) then comes CTC (third codon? Or split as ATG TTT C TC? Wait maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait let's take the original DNA: 5’-[ATG][TTT][CTC][GCT][GGT][ACT][TCT][GTG][GAT][GAA][CAT][ATT][TAT][TGT][CGT]… TGA -3'.

Each bracket is a codon. So:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. CTC (Leu)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. GGT (Gly)
6. ACT (Thr)
7. TCT (Ser)
8. GTG (Val)
9. GAT (Asp)
10. GAA (Glu)
11. CAT (His)
12. ATT (Ile)
13. TAT (Tyr)
14. TGT (Cys)
15. CGT (Arg)
...
TGA (stop)

Now, Mutant 1: first exons (beginning):

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

ATG TCT ACG CTG GTA CTT CTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GC... TGA

Wait, but that might not align. Wait the original codons after ATG were TTT, CTC, GCT etc.

Mutant 1 after ATG is TCT (positions 2-4?), which is different from the original, OR the way the sequence is written may have mutation at certain positions without changing the codon count. Let me compare the sequences base by base.

Original DNA:

5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T…TGA-3’

Wait, formatting that layout could be problematic. Probably instead, list the DNA strings of original and mutant 1, aligned.

Original (from start): positions 1-24: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T... Mutant 1:

Starting as ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T...

Wait compare the sequences:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T GAA...

Mutant 1:       T C   A                 
So, first T T T becoming T T C (positions 4-6?), then the next codon perhaps?

Actually, to better see, perhaps list each nucleotide position, noticing where changes occur.

Original gene:

1-3: ATG  
4-6: TTC (TTT in positions 4-6? Wait wait the first codon is ATG (positions 1-3). Then next codon is positions 4-6. Original sequence:

ATG (1-3), then the next triplet would be TTC (4-6), T C the next few. Wait perhaps the original sequence's first exon is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA.

Now that is separated into codons as:

ATG (1-3), then TTT (4-6), then CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), etc.

Mutant 1:

ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA.

Comparing:

Original (codons): 1: ATG, 2: TTT, 3: CTC, 4: GCT...

Mutant1 codons: 1: ATG, 2: TTC, 3: TAC, 4: GCT...

So the original CT in codon3 (CTC) becomes TA (TAC). How is that possible? The third codon in the original is positions 7-9: CTC. In mutant1, it's TAC. So there's a T → T (position7?), wait:

If original codon3: positions7-9: CTC (C is position7? Let me check:

Wait each codon is triplet over positions:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT [positions 4-6: but T's letters are: positions 4,5,6: TTT (original fourth codon next is 7,8,9: CTC (Leu in original). But in Mutant1:

ATG TTC TAC GCT ... So replacing TTT (positions4-6) in original with TTC (same amino acid), and CTC positions7-9 in original with TAC. So perhaps this is a substitution at positions7 and 8? Wait original position7: C (C), T, C.

Original CTC (codon3), codon3 in mutant1 is TAC. How? Let's map the specific mutations:

Original: after ATG: T-T-T-C-T-C… (position4–9)

Mutant1: T-T-C-T-A-C (positions4-9). 

Wait, original positions4: T, 5: T, 6: T (codon2: TTT). But mutant1 in codon2: TTC (positions4,5:TT, position6: C?) So, codon2 changes from TTT (Phe) to TTC (Phe), which is a silent mutation.

Moving beyond that, original positions7-9: C T C → coding for Leu (CTC). In mutant1, positions7-9 are T A C, which makes codon3: TAC (Tyr). But how did this substitution happen? If nucleotides in positions7-9 changed from CTC to TAC, that requires a C→T at position7 (first base of codon3, resulting in TTC?), perhaps another mutation. 

Alternatively, but this might indicate a frameshift if there was an insertion or deletion, another mutational process. However, MMS tends to cause point mutations, not insertions/deletions, which are more common with other mutagens like radiation.

But looking at Mutant 1 and original, the length seems the same. So maybe two point mutations: T→T (no change), but perhaps other positions. Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion about how the codons are being changed. Alternatively, perhaps the alignment is wrong. Alternatively, think of Mutant1 as having two point mutations:

From original triplet positions4-6 TTT (Phe) changed to TTC (Phe), silent. Then in the next codon positions7-9 CTC (Leu) changed to TAC (Tyr). 

Wait that requires a C→T at position7 (from original C to T in mutant), making first base of codon3 as T, so altering CTC to TTC? But in mutant1 it's TAC. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. If original DNA in 7-9: CTC (so on coding strand), mRNA will be CUA (but mRNA is complementary to the DNA's template strand. Wait, if the DNA is coding the same as mRNA, then in coding strand DNA, CTC is Leu. However, mRNA is CUG possibly. Not sure, but given this is the coding strand, then yes. So maybe mutant1 changes nucleotides in positions... For example, mutation in position x causes a substitution in codon3, leading to Leu→Tyr. 

If the codon for Leu (CTC) mutates to TAC (Tyr), this is a missense mutation. However, since the anti-nutritional compound's gene product needs to be functional for the compound to be produced, changing an amino acid could reduce the enzyme's activity. However, whether it sufficiently inactivates the enzyme is unknown. Another mutation in the same mutant could be at another position. For example, notice that the next codon in original CGT (Arg) in position 15 becomes CGC (Arg), which is a  silent mutation at position x. So, perhaps Mutant1 has two silent mutations (TTC for Phe and CGC for Arg) and the codon3 CTC→TAC (Leu→Tyr). Only one amino acid change here. If that's a critical residue, it might affect enzyme function, but this is speculative. So might not completely knock out the enzyme; could lead to reduced production. But without knowing the enzyme's structure, hard to say, but frame shifts or stop codons are more likely to eliminate function.

Mutant 2:

Original: ATG T T T CTC GCT ... Mutant2: ATG T T C TA A GCT ... Let's examine Mutant2's DNA:

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons after ATG:

TTA AGC ...? Let's do this step-by-step:

Codon break after ATG (position1-3):

Original codon positions:

1-3:ATG, 4-6: TTT,7-9:CTC,10-12:GCT, etc.

Mutant2:

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ... 

Codon1: ATG (same)
Codon2: TTC (Phe) same as Mutant1.
Codon3: TAA (vs original CTC)
So original codon3 is Leu (CTC), but mutant3 codon3 is TAA, which is a stop codon. So that would introduce a premature stop codon at codon3, leading to truncated protein. This is a nonsense mutation. If this is the case, Mutant2 has a nonsense mutation in codon3 (early in the gene), causing translation to stop prematurely. This would likely render the gene product nonfunctional, thus preventing the anti-nutritional compound's synthesis. So Mutant2 seems promising. Let's check this. 

Original codon3: CTC (Leu). In original DNA sequence, positions7-9: C T C. If Mutant2's positions7-9 are T A A, then substitution of C→T at position7 and T→A at position8 and C→A at position9? Wait, mutiple point mutations? Or possibly what's the mutation. 

Wait, Mutant2's third codon (positions7-9):

Original CTC → TAA?

Looking at the original sequence and mutant2 at codon3:

Original: CT C (positions 7-9? Let me count DNA characters. 

Original gene:

Positions:

1-3: ATG  
4-6: TTT  
7-9: CTC  
10-12: GCT  
12-15: ..., etc.

Mutant2's DNA around third codon:

ATG TTC TAA GCT ... So, after first codon ATG, the second is TTC (positions4-6: T T C → so in original, second codon was T T T). Then third codons in mutant2 is TAA. Then fourth codon GCT (Ala), same as original.

Original's third codon was CTC (Leu) at positions7-9. To get TAA here, in mutant2:

positions7: C→T (reverse is impossible?), positions8: T→A, positions9: C→A? EMS is typically point mutations causing replacement of G to A. Wait, perhaps only one nucleotide changed? Let me check the actual DNA sequence:

Original DNA fragment for codons/exons:

5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T ...-3’

Mutant 2's DNA:

5’-ATG T T C T A A G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T ...-3’

So from the original’s T T T (codon2), now T T C (no amino acid change), then the following nucleotides: after T T T T C in original or in mutant?

Alternatively, let's match the exact sequencing:

Original first part:

ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T ... 

Mutant1’s code after the first few nucleotides: ATG T T C T A C G C T ... (probably);

But for mutant2: the sequence is ATG T T C T A A G C T ... So comparing the original (which was ATG T T T C T C G C T ...), while Mutant2 has TTC (second codon) and then T A A next. So the original nucleotides after second codon were C T C (positions7-9), and this becomes T A A in mutant2. So replacing positions7-9 (CTC) with TAA. Let's break that down:

Original nucleotide at position7: C → T in mutant2.

Position8: T → A.

Position9: C → A. 

This would require two point mutations (positions7 and 8 or 8 and9?), but EMS usually causes single nucleotide changes. It's possible, perhaps, that there was a deletion, which causes frameshifting. Let's check the exact mutation.

But looking purely at the given sequences:

Original first exon fragment:

ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant2:

ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Underline the changes: compare to original:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Mark differences:

Positions:

Original: index=4 (T), but sequence starts count at 1: may vary, but let's compare positionally.

At positions overlapping:

Original 

... at the start, first differs at the 5th nucleotide:

Original: T T T C T C...

Mutant2: T T C T A A...

Wait, original codon2 is TTT (positions4-6), mutant2 has TTC (codon2). Then original codon3 is CT-C, so DNA sequence following after codon2 is CTCT ... perhaps.

Wait better to write side by side:

Original:

5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T ACT... (and so on)

Mutant2:

5’-ATG T T C T A A G C T G G T ACT...

So, this mutation replaces three nucleotides in the original (the third codon):

Original C T C (positions7-9: C in 7, T in8, C in9), becomes T A A in positions7-9 (Mutant2: CTAAGCT? Let's actual and mutant indexing:

Original after ATG TTT: C T C G C T G G….

Mutant2 after ATG TTC: T A A G C T G G ….

So between, three nucleotides:

Original had CTC (positions7-9?), while mutant2 has TAA here.

That would require three changes:

- C→T (position7)
- T→A (position8)
- C→A (position9)

But having three mutations in such proximity is very unlikely, given that EMS causes point mutations randomly. Therefore, this can't be three simultaneous mutations, which would be improbable.

Alternatively, maybe the original and mutant are shifted somehow. Wait, is there an insertion or deletion causing a frameshift? Let's check:

Mutant3 and Mutant4 also vary, but here comparing mutant 2, let's check length.

Mutant2 seems to have the same number of nucleotides in this segment because there are no apparent insertions or deletions. If so, three point mutations in neighboring nucleotides are unlikely, but the change could happen via a double mutation. EMS can cause multiple mutations, but it's rare. 

If we accept the sequence as given, mutant2 introduces a TAA stop codon in the third codon. This would terminate translation after the second codon (since the third codon is now a stop codon). However, position3 is the third codon. So if the sequence after ATG reads TTC, then TAA, this would be:

Protein sequence: Met (ATG), Phe (TTC), then Stop (TAA) codon. This would truncate the protein after the second amino acid, making it non-functional, thus preventing the anti-nutritional compound's production. If that's accurate, Mutant2 would be a good candidate. Thus, introducing a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation) early would eliminate the protein product potentially.

So Mutant2 (sequence leading to TAA stop codon third position) is likely the best candidate. 

Other mutants: 

Mutant3: has an insertion? The sequence length is longer. Looking at Mutant3's DNA:

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Compare with original:

Original: …CTGGTACTTCTGTG…

Mutant3: …CTGGTGTCACTTCTGTG…

Examining the sequences: around the fourth or fifth codon. Possibly an insertion of "TGTA" or similar, which might cause a frameshift. Let's look at the difference:

Original's 5'-GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT…-3'

Mutant3's 5'-GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT… 

Wait in the original:

GGT (positions10-12: Gly), ACT (Thr, maybe positions13-15), TCT (Ser), etc.

In Mutant3, the sequences after GGT becomes GTC ACT...

So original: GGT ACT TCT → (Gly, Thr, Ser)

Mutant3: GGT GTC ACT TCT → expanded? What is the change in codons.

It's possible that there's an insertion of a base? Let's count nucleotides.

Original sequence in the area in question:

CTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT… which breaks to CTG GTA CTT CTG TGG ...

But better to split original into codons after mutation. Alternate approach: look for inserted or deleted bases. How does mutant3 differ in length?

Original: …CTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT… length perhaps varies: the wildtype hasn't an extra sequence. Mutant3 text has "ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’"

Original's exons start with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... versus Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Comparing specific positions:

After ATG, the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG …

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG …

So, the difference: original sixth codon ACT (Thr) is replaced by GTC (Val)? Wait, more accurately:

Original has the codon sequence:

TTT (4-6)
CTC (7-9)
GCT (10-12)
GGT (13-15)
ACT (16-18)

Mutant3’s codons after ATG are:

TTT (4-6)
TAC (7-9)
GCT (10-12)
GGT (13-15)
GTC (16-18)
ACT (19-21)

So in Mutant3, between GGT and ACT (original after GGT by positions?), thirdly, additional nucleotides causing an insertion? Alternatively, codons after GGT (position13-15). Original sequence after GGT_ ACT_TCT. Mutant3: GTG TC_ ACT. This seems a possible insertion of two nucleotides, which would cause a frameshift. 

But actually，seeing：

Original sequence: GGT ACT TCT → amino acids: Gly, Thr, Ser.

Mutant3 after GGT becomes GTC ACT TCT → which would imply:

Amino acids GGT (Gly) retained. Then codons GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser). 

Comparing to original after GGT, mutant3's sequence inserts GTC between GGT and ACT. This can't be a frameshift (adding three nucleotides would insert one extra amino acid). If a triplet is inserted, adding one amino acid (Val) letting the last code read ACT (Thr). But then just inserting a codon. But in that case, the open reading frame remains, but with an extra amino acid (Val). Are the extra nucleotides present? Alternatively, original's GGT ACT TCT (codon5: GGT Gly, ACT Thr, TCT Ser) becomes GGT GTC ACT TCT. That implies a insertion of GTC, but adding incomplete triplet? Part of the problem here is doubt about how one actually parses the sequences; possibly a portion is misaligned. 

Alternatively, the mutant3's DNA might have had a duplication or an added base. Noticing after GCTGG... maybe the DNA has:

Original: GCTGGTACT... → GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant3： GCTGGTGTCACT... → GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So here, after GCT (original codon), then GGT (original # Gly), then ORIGINALLY ACT (codons 6,7, maybe. Wait how to parse.

Original _GCTGGTACTTCT_: GCT (codon4, 10-12),GGT (13-15,codon5) ACT (16-18,codon6), TCT (19-21,codon7)

Mutant3: GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT... therefore, inserting GTC between GGT and ACT. This implies insertion of GTC tri dénouement: thus, the mutant3 has an insertion of three nucleotides (thus coding for Val (GTC)) between codon5 and codon6. This would be an in-frame insertion, adding an additional amino acid (Val) but preserving the rest of the reading frame. Thus, the resulting protein would have an extra valine residue between what was codon5 (GGT, Gly) and codon6 (ACT, Thr) in the original.

This is a inframe insertion, so it inserts an extra amino acid but doesn't change the rest of the frame. Depending on where this occurs, it might disrupt a crucial active site, but due to EMS causing mainly point mutations, a three-nucleotide insertion (3 GTA) for instance. But EMS doesn't typically cause insertions. Insertions are more often caused by other mutagens. So possibly, Mutant3 has a **duplication** of a codon? Or a point mutation leading to a substitution. Wait looking back, another possibility. Comparing Original to Mutant3 in which parts:

Mutant3 might have a point mutation that causes altered nucleotides, altering subsequent codons. For example, in Original, after GCT (codon10-12) comes GGT (positions13-15, codon5?), then ACT (codonde titten 16-18; Thr). Mutant3 may have:

 GGT GTC ACT

This would be changing ACT (codon6,16-18) but with inserted GTC. Alternatively, the codon layout may be misaligned. If EMS causes a transversion altering few nucleotides, leading to a different sequence but maintaining the same number of nucleotides, so possible in-frame mutations but with additional a to a pre-existing codon. Acqprovoking a "GTC" replacing some existing codons. However, perhaps there's an error in reading this.

Alternatively, maybe Mutant3 has a point mutation that turned a nucleotide further downstream but showed up in their sequence here? For example::

Original codon5： GGT (positions13-15, Gly)→ but in Mutant3, attach after GGT a GTC.

Alternatively, let me pin down exact sequences. Oir original sequence beginning:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...-3’

Mutant 3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...-3’

Comparing sequentially:

Original: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C...

Mutant3: ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T... 

So highlighting the differences: position4: Original T, mutant3 position4: an extra T, causing a shift? Wait no:

Position analysis would follow:

Original nucleotides (index starts after IGN, first three are ATG):
4 T,5 T,6 T (, TTT) (second codon: Phe)
7 C,8 T,9 C (third codon: Leu)
10 G,11 C,12 T (fourth codon: Ala?, Which is GCT)
13 G,14 G,15 T (fifth codon: GGT, Gly)
16 A,17 C,18 T (sixth codon: ACT, Thr)
...

Mutant3:

4 T,5 T,6 T (TTT) [codon2: Phe]
7 T (instead of C),8 A,9 C (codon3 mutated from CTC→TAC,... but perhaps not possible?)

Wait the mutant3 has T T T T A C G C T..., possible inserts:

ATG T T T T A C G C T ... ( positions 4: T, 5: T, 6: T, 7: T, tạo codon 2 và 3 như thần thế tỷ. It could cause a frameshift? Because if there's an additional T at position7, then the reading frameshifts. For example:

Assume original have after ATG:TT-TCTCGT..., but mutant3 now has after ATG:TT-TTT-ACG..., if that's the case, it's inserting an extra T. Let's see:

Original: ATG TTTCTC..., which as three nucleotides for codon2: TTT, and CTC...

Mutant3: ATG TTTTAC..., codons would be TTT, TAC——HERE FEEL. 

Wait, TTTTAC could be read as TTT followed by TAC. So codon2: TTT (Phe), codon3: TAC (Tyr). Thus no frameshift but a substitution with the third codon.

This gives us substitution in codon3 from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr) with a mutated base. Such missense mutations. Bit happens here? However, in the dna sequences, this regiomen may involve inserting a nucleotide. Wait confusion arises from comparing sequences correctly. Alternatively, the DNA aligns as follows, showed here:

Mutant3's:ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTC...

brekdown:

Original:

codgo: 1: ATG, 2: TTT,3:CTC,4: GCT,5: GGT...

Mutant3: ATG, TTT, TAC, GCT,GGT,...

But to check if it's an insertion, Are the later codons shifted? 

In original codon5 is GGT (Gly,positions13-15)，ACT (codon6 positions16-18).

In Mutant3, for example, later in sequence, before TCT, we seeGTGTC:

In mutant3's code here... GGTGTCACT. So this suggests GGT GTC ACT joined. So codons:

12-15: GGT

15-18? (depending where we start) But perhaps transforming codon5 from GGT to something else. It's getting complicated, but the key point is:

Does mutant3 have vanished or shifted codons intendantarly analyzed. Importantly though,Mutant3 may show altered sequence caused by an insert or other point mutations leading to different amino.adds. 

However, Mutant3's key feature beyond códons 2-3 change (äänäuction to Tyr)，as well as perhaps a frameshift from an insertion. 

Alternatively, inquiry ill-founded.

But assuming the 'TGGT' part in mutant34 is mutated to 'TGTC', which affects neighboring codons. Alternatively, perhaps Mutant3 has a deletion instead, truncating the chain.

Due to Mutation3's way of presentation in the text, which could have a triplet inserted. But given the consent.ion here, method; if the question is about selecting the monoition that Milosh elucidate the gene function, the Oblate with a premature replaced codμtation #2's TAA-stop codon Inducing a premature termination would likely eb the best candidateol.

But in the DNA sequence for mutant4:

Wait: but after GCT in mutant4: followed by ACT. Then let's see:

In original, after GCT is GGT, whereasMutant4S not insertGCT followedshock by ACT, so sorte original GG T ACT (*GGTACT*) become ACTTCT. So there is deletion of the GG from GGT.

Which would lead the sequence `GCT (codon4), ACT (codon5)}` leading to:

Let\'s check. The first few nucleotides of mutant1:\n\nATG TTC TAC GCT ...\n\nOriginal began with ATG TTT CTC GCT...\n\nSo, Original, first three codons:\n\nATG (Met), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu)\n\nMutant 1 first three codons:\n\nATG (Met), TTC (Phe), TAC (Tyr)\n\nThird codon changed from CTC to TAC. Let’s figure out the change: in the third codon, original has CTC (Leu), mutant1 has TAC (positions 7-9). \n\nOriginal codon third: CTC (DNA) → CUC in mRNA → Leu.\n\nMutant’s third codon: TAC (DNA) → UAC in mRNA → Tyr. Therefore, a missense mutation (Leu to Tyr). Whether this is damaging depends on the site’s importance, but a single amino acid substitution might not deactivate an enzyme. If the enzyme\'s active site is affected, maybe. But unless we know the exact structure, it\'s hard to say if a Leu→Tyr change would do so. But since the anti-nutritional compound is produced, maybe a single mutation isn\'t enough for a null? Possibly, but we need check others.\n\nMoreover, looking further in mutant1\'s sequence, towards the end: at positions ... TGTCGC …TGA. Original has TGTCGT; the last nucleotide of that codon (CGT → Arg) became CGC (Arg again). It\'s a synonymous mutation; no effect. So perhaps the mutation in mutant1 is a missense in the third codon, replacing Leu with Tyr. Not sure if that disrupts the protein\'s function significantly. Possible, but perhaps.\n\nMutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal starts as ATGTTTCTCGCT... so the first minor regions:\n\nOriginal codons after ATG: \nnuc 4-6: TTT (Phe)\nnuc7-9: CTC (Leu)\nnuc10-12: GCT (Ala)\nIn mutant2: \nAfter ATG TTC TAA GCT... etc.\n\nSo, 4-6: TTC (Phe, same as Mutant1, silent). But then nuc7-9: TAA.\n\nTAA is a stop codon (in mRNA: UAA). So in the original, at codon 3 (positions7-9) was CTC (Leu). In mutant2, the third codon becomes TAA. So in DNA, that\'s TAA (mRNA: UAA), which is a stop codon. \n\nTherefore, this would lead to a premature termination of translation, resulting in a truncated protein. If the gene produces the anti-nutritional compound. Such a premature stop could lead to a nonfunctional protein, preventing the synthesis of the compound. This would be a nonsense mutation.\n\nBetween early stop codons leading to loss of gene product. Since the problem requires elimination of the compound, which requires disabling the gene\'s function, mutant2\'s stop codon might result in a nonfunctional enzyme, hence eliminating production of the anti-nutritional compound. This seems like a strong candidate.\n\nMutant3:5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nCompare with original: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...\n\nOriginal:\n\nPositions 4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\npositions7-9: CTC (now mutant has TAC?)\n\nWait, original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... \n\nMutant3: ATG T T T T CGA ...\n\nWait, perhaps need better alignment.

In mutant3, they are T,A,C. So the first C becomes T (mutation), in position8 the T becomes A, in position9, C remains. So changing CTC (Leu) into TAC (Tyr). However, disrupting the next codons. Wait perhaps the mutation is at position7, as some as insertion or substitution.\n\nBut actually, comparing across:\n\nOriginal (positions 7-9): C T C → codon CTC → Leu.\n\nMutant3 (positions 7-9): T A C → TAC → Tyr. So this is a point mutation changing C to T in position7, T to A in position8 (that is two consecutive substitutions: positions 7 and 8). Alternatively, may they have inserted a T somewhere causing a frameshift? For instance, inserting a T at position7 leading to a frameshift, altering downstream codons.\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...\n\nMutant3 sequence in codons: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...\n\nHence, after the first TTT (Phe), next codon becomes TAC (Tyr), GCT still Ala, GGT (Gly), but then GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr)...\n\nWait, original has ACT at positions 16-18 (codon ACT → Thr). Mutant3 after GGT (positions 13-15), next three nucleotides in original should be ACT. But if in mutant3, the next nucleotides are GTC? Let’s check:\n\nOriginal... GGT ACT TCT ..., which is after GGT (13-15), Original is GGT ACT ...\n\nMutant3 is GGT GTC ACT ...\n\nSo, altered to GTC at codon 16-18 instead of ACT.\n\nThat\'s a substitution. The GTC (Val) replacing ACT (Thr), but with the rest following. So there is a frameshift here? Where did the extra nucleotides come in? No, unless there\'s an insertion.\n\nLooking at nucleotide positions more carefully:\n\nOriginal first exones: if we look sequentially.

How?\n\nWait, the original at position 4: T, 5:T,6:T (pos4-6: TTT).\n\nThen positions7-9: first base is C (position7), T (8), C (9) → CTC.\n\nPoint mutations in mutant3 at positions7-9 (C→T, T→ A,C→?) Or perhaps insertions? Wait, in the given mutant3 sequence, after ATG:\n\nFourth nucleotide: T (pos4), fifth T(pos5), sixth T(pos6). So first three Ts: positions 4-6 as original (as in the first codon after ATG: So positions 4-6: TTT (same as original: TTT ⇒ Phe). Position7 in original is C. Mutant3 has another T at position7 followed by A and C. Wait, that would make the sequence:\n\nFirst codon after ATG: TTT (positions4-6: still correct).\n\nThen second codon in original: positions7-9 C T C (CTC: Leu)\n\nIn mutant3, starting from position7. If position7 is T, then the next nucleotides would be T position7, A position8, C position9. TAC.\n\nBut in terms of coding:\n\nThen third codon GCT (positions10-12) in original), mutant3 same? Let’s check:\n\nAfter TAC (codon 7-9?), then GCT in original.\n\nIn mutant3, code continues as GCTGGTGTCACT...\n\nSo after TAC,  the next three letters are GC (from 10-11?), so GCT is okay.\n\nBut looking at the subsequent codons, mutant3 has a new triplet insertion or something. Wait, maybe not. If TS only has point mutations, getting ahead… Wait, another discrepancy comes with:\n\nOriginal: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTGG...\nMutant3: ...GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTGG...\n\nPosition13-15 in original: GGT (should be same as mutant3? not?)\n\nOriginal positions 13-15 (GGT) is the same as Mutant3. Then original has ACT (position16-18), and Mutant3 has GTC at positions16-18, original ACT.\n\nThis would be substituting the original ACT (Thr) with GTC (Val). But that would be a substitution if the sequence progression is maintained. However, how the mutation happened causes this? Let\'s look at the DNA sequence.\n\nIf in the original:\n\nFirst part: ...C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...\n\nIn mutant3:\n\n... T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T...\n\nHere, after pos9 (changes):\n\nOriginal: cont. GCTGGTACTTCT...\n\nMutant3:            GCTGGTGT C ACTTCT...\n\nSo in the mutant3:\n\nAt position 16-18 (ACT → GTC) in original. However, in terms of nucleotides, perhaps there has been a single substitution but With . How can this mutation happen? First, original after codon TAC (mutant has at position7-9 TAC instead of CTC). Then proceeding:\n\nOriginal positions 7-12: CTC GCT GGT → in mutant3 this would be TAC GCT GGT (assuming no other changes), but mutant3 actually\'s sequence is at codon positions TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT. Wait, hard to tell, maybe there\'s a T-A changed into G leading to other substitutions. \n\nPossibly this GTC at position16-18 is a point mutation of original ACT (Thr→Val) but also involving maybe a deletion or insertion.\n\nAlternatively, it\'s possible that mutant3 has an insertion of two nucleotides, changing the frame from position rx onwards, but in the problem statement, their sequences have similar lengths. Wait, Mutant3\'s sequence, the full written one include "…TGT..." but visually, the length perhaps is longer?\n\nOriginal gene length shown starts with:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA C ATATTT ATT GTC GT ...TGA.\n\nComparing Wirth mutant3\'s:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3\'\n\nIn writing, original seems to be:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... Whereas mutant3 is:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nLooking at the altered regions in the beginning:\n\nIt appears that in mutant3, after initial ATG, there\'s TTTT where the original had TTT CTC. Then there\'s differentiation where in the first part:\n\nOriginal: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...\n\nLooking at the nucleotides:\n\nOriginal: pos 7-9:CTC\n\nMutant3: pos7: inserted a T? Because ir now has TTTT A C.\n\nWait, if original TTT CTC → TTT TC after the ATG? Not sure, expected it\'s TTT CTC GCT.\n\nMutant3\'s sequence would then be inserting a T after TTT, leading to a frameshift? For instance:\n\nOriginal sequence following ATG as positions 4-: T T T C T C G...\n\nMutant3 would be T T T T A C G...\n\nInserting a T after the third T (at original position7?), shifting the reading frame. Let me suppose there was insertion of a T at position7. Then:\n\noriginal codon1 (after ATG): positions4-6: TTT\n\noriginal codon2: 7-9: C T C → CTC (Leu)\n\noriginal codon3:10-12 G C T (Ala)\n\nMutant3 with frame shifted:\n\nAfter insertion in position7, let\'s number positions:\n\n1-3 ATG = pos1-3 (ATG)\n\npos4: T\n\npos5:T\n\npos6:T\n\npos7: inserted T ⇒ new frame: 4: T, 5: T, 6: T, 7: T, 8: A, 9: C ...\n\nnew codons in mutant3 after ATG:\n\ncodon1 (4-6): T-T-T → TTT (Phe)\n\ncodon2 (7-9): T-A-C → TAC (Tyr)\n\ncodon3 (10-12): G-C-T → GCT (Ala)\n\nWait, but then losing align. If codon2 starts at pos7-9: TAC.\n\nThen it\'s possible that the mutation here is insertion of an additional T after TTT. Insert position7 as T (original was C, then T, C). Wait, unclear.\n\nActually, if they\'ve got TTT TAC..., compared to original TTT CTC..., it\'s an insert of an extra T and substitution of T A C in positions5-7 (if inserted T at position4?) It\'s confusing. Alternatively, this could be multiple point mutations.\n\nAlternatively, There\'s a substitution in positions downstream.\n\nBut, consider if mutant3 introduces a T inserted in the region. Inserting a T would shift the reading frame from that point onwards. So, insertion of a T in between the TTT and CTC:\n\nOriginal: ... TTT C T C ...\n\nmutant3: ...TTTT AC...\n\nThe insertion of T after the initial TTT would change the codon after that. So insert an extra T at the end of the first codon (after TTT, insert T), leading to TTT T C ... but how does that transition to TAC?\n\nAlternatively, Maybe the original sequence after ATG is TTTCTC..., and mutant3 has a TTTA..., altering the next codon. Given the confusion, I need to look for others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mutant3, the original sequence at the beginning have a mutated base that disrupts the reading frame. Usually, frame shifts can arise from insertions or deletions of non-multiples of three nucleotides, leading to mistranslation downstream. So if in mutant there is an insertion or deletion changing the reading frame from the start, causing altered amino acids and possibly premature stops, thereby inactivating the protein.\n\nAlternatively, comparing original and mutant3 and look for frame shifts. For example, if there\'s a single nucleotide insert, starting at an earlier position.\n\nWait, in Mutant3:\n\nLooking at the initial first few codons:\n\nOriginal:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nMutant3:\n\nATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nSo mid allowing, the original codon after TTT is CTC (position7-9), then GCT(10-12), then GGT(13-15).)\n\nIn mutant3, after TTT, there\'s TAC (which suggests substitutes CTC with TAC (possibly replacing a triplet). But down the line, how does the sequence mutate.\n\nThe key parts: after codon GGT (positions13-15), original has ACT (Thr) (16-18), but mutant3 has GTC (Val). Then next:ACT (just like original).\n\nThis indicates that AFTER codon 16-18, original is TCT but in mutant3, we continue normally. Therefore, perhaps no frame shift, but one or more Substitutions.\n\nHowever, the nucleotide change in mutant3 brings in an additional GTC. So position CTC to TAC (substitutions in positions?) Possibly two point mutations here: C->T and T->A, but sequentially, original:\n\nOriginal: positions7-9: C T C ⇒ leads to CTC (Leu)\n\nIn mutant3: T A C ⇒ TAC (Tyr). Is that substitution in two positions (C→T and T→A). Maybe.\n\nThis is a missense mutation. It’s possible that would disrupt protein function, but maybe not. Whether two nucleotide changes could result in a critical section, but again depends on location.\n\nAnother possible mutation here could be a frameshift if an insertion causes a shift in the reading. Let me think: for example, a +1 frameshift.\n\nSuppose the original sequence after ATG TT T, next C T C G C T, i.e., positions4-6 T-T-T PMC, 7-9 C-T-C.\n\nIn mutant3: after ATG TT TT. C, followed by T AAC...\n\nThis might suggest inserting an extra T between the first TTT and CTC.\n\nOriginal: ATGTTT||CTC GCT...\nMutant3: ATGTTT T || TAC GCT...\n\nInsertion of a T after position6 (after ATGTTT), giving an extra T, and then continues TAC...\n\nThat would cause a frameshift. Inserting one T would shift the reading frame from that point. In such a case, the original codon after TT T was CTC (Leu), but inserting a T makes it TT T T AC GCT...\n\nSo codons after mutation would be TTT (original Phe), then TTA (inserted T plus next two), which would be TTA (Leu), then CGG (and the rest). The original was TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), which starts off as Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...\n\nAfter the frame shift, Ma y be Phe(TTT), then TTA (Leu), then CGG (Arg), TGC (Cys), and so on. If the insertion leads to a different amino acid sequence, possibly creating a frameshifted protein. However, Frameshifts often lead to long stretches of incorrect amino acids and potential premature stop codons downstream and thus nonfunctional proteins. If that\'s the case, this mutant may produce a truncated or otherwise abnormal protein, thereby eliminating the problematic compound. But, seeming if the frame shift here. Given that the way the mutation is written, though, would determine whether insertion happened. For Mutant3 the DNA sequence is: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGT… which seems to start as ATG TTTTAC... Apartgtttt There are now four T\'s and AC futher. So, compared to original’s ATG ttt ctc… inserting a T after the first three T\'s would ddelayed frameshift here 0 but. Then the codons after would read like:\n\n5\'-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3\'\n\nWhich codons would be:\n\n- ATG (codon1: Met)\n\n- TTT (codon2: Phe)\n\n- TAC (codon3: Tyr)\n\n- GCT (codon4: Ala)\n\n- GGT (codon5: Gly)\n\n- GTC (codon6: Val)\n\n- ACT (codon7: Thr)\n\nFollowed by original sequences again. So no frame shift happened; instead, point mutations in the CTC→ TAC and ACT → GTC. But if this is the case, I need to check whether that leads to messed up Активатор белка.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the sequence written as mutant 3:\n\n5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGA... there is an insertion changing the reading frame. Let\'s suppose original:\n\nAfter ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...\n\nMutant3: ATG T T T T A C cta..., which with an extra T. SO, after ATG, next codon was TTT, in mutant3, after ATG. the first three TTT remain same (positions4-6). Then, inserting another T, making the sequence TTT-T. So in this mutant, the codon is now positions7-9 are TAC (starting from[positions7: T (inserted) A (old position7) C (old position8). Butin this case, the reading frame shifts from position7 onwards.\n\nTherefore, the first Codon1_met, Codon2_ttt (Phe), Codon3 positions7-9 now read as TAC (Tyr), but codon3 normally spanned positions7-9, which in original was CTC (Leu). Whether this is a single insertion of T at position7? If yes, the balance nucleotide adds +1 and causes a frameshift? Or an insertion of T perhaps combined with substitution. Hmmm. In that case, the following sequence GG would shift backwards.\n\nIf there is an insertion of T after position6, the DNA becomes:\n\nOriginal: ATG-T-T-T-C-T-C-G...\n\nAfter insertion: ATG-T-T-T-T-C-T-C-G…\n\nThen the triplets become.\n\nCodon2: T-T-T → same Phe.\n\nCodon3: T-T-C (after insertion, T at pos7, then T pos8^original tue inserted? Probably becoming something like TTC, which is Phe or similar. But perhaps this illustrate the ambiguity.\n\nAlternatively, call it a draw each triplet again when you insert a nt:\n\nOriginal Tongue after ATG)\n\nTTther stuff just getting messy. Perhaps muta jean0.3 includes both a substitution deemed an Some in\'ser On on. Challenges leads to Complex The conclusion seems risky.\n\nPutting this aside for a moment and looking to Mutant4:\n\nMutant4:5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal:after ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant4: When I decode: after ATG, TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...\n\nComparing:\n\nMutant4: ...ACGCTACTTC...\n\nOriginal: ...GCTGGTACTT...\n\nMutant4 sequence after GCT is ACT (in the sequence).\n\nOriginal, after GCT was GGT, then ACT. But in Mutant4, after GCT in position 10-12, “ACT“ follows.\n\nSo, original:\n\nGCT (position 10-12: Ala), GGT (13-15: Gly), ACT (16-18: Thr)\n\nMutant4:\n\nACG (position7-9?), actual sequence.\n\nErr, dossier, proceed slowly.\n\nOriginal has: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant 4: after ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...\n\nSo looks like before GCT had been changed to His perhaps. Original where.\n\nOriginal positions 7-9: CTC (Leu).\n\nMutant4\'s positions7-9: TAC (Tyr), same as Mutant2 changed codons wherever. But where else... The difference is in GGT ACT TCT ... original vs GCT ACT TCT in mutant4. So mutant4 deletes GGT. Letme check original vs mutant4:\n\nOriginal transcribed into sections:\n\nATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...\n\nMutant4 is:\n\nATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...\n\nOriginal sequence: the portion after TGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... has "GGT" before ACT.\n\nMutant4: After TS= ATGTTTTACGCT,, then ACT missing the uneven ‘GGT’ part.\n\nLooking at your sequences:\n\nOriginal:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\nTTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...\n\nMutant4:\n\nTTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...\n\nWhich means that GGT is missing: i.e., the "GGT" codon (positions13-15) corresponding to Glycine in original is absent in Mutant4. So this looks like a deletion of the GGT (three nucleotides, 13-15), leading to a deletion of the Gly at position . \n\nHence, the resulting mRNA would not have those three nucleotides (resulting breaksgensesre in proteins a shrunken by one amino acid. No frame shift caused since three nucleotides were deleted (a in-frame deletion).\n\nThis deletion of three nucleotides (a codon) would simply remove one amino acid (a gly) but keep the rest intact. If the deleted Gly is important for function, perhaps compromising the enzyme. However, often single amino acid deletions may have minimal effect unless in critical regions.\n\nAlternatively, mutant4’s sequence could.Be reconsidered as a deletion of more nucleotides. Let me to spot:\n\nLooking at the written mutant4 sequence:ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’\n\nOriginal gene: comparison:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTT C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T ...\n\nMutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACT TCTGTGGAT...| flashsolve\n\nSo after ATGTTT, original has CTC GCT GGT …\n\nMutant4 has TA CGCT ACT … So the TA CGCT replaces a part.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the most probable mutation is **Mutant 2**. This mutant introduces a **nonsense mutation** (TAA stop codon) in the third exon, leading to premature termination of translation. This results in a truncated, non-functional protein, effectively disrupting the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. 

**Analysis Summary:**
- **Mutant 1**: Missense mutation (Leu → Tyr) may not fully disable the protein.
- **Mutant 2**: Nonsense mutation (CTC → TAA) introduces an early stop codon, abolishing protein function.
- **Mutant 3**: Potential frameshift or missense mutation; unclear if it fully disrupts the protein.
- **Mutant 4**: In-frame deletion of one codon (Gly), which may not sufficiently impair function.

**Final Answer:** Mutant 2.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 However, traditional pairwise comparison of each position is required.

Alternative approach, count nucleotide differences:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT
Mutant 1: ATG TTTCTA CGC TGG... (Wait, it's better to index the exact mutations. Wait, original's sequence started ATG T T T C T C G C T etc. Maybe there's a deletion or other?

But Mutant 1's sequence is: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing base by base.

Original: 1-15: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C
Wait. Let's line them up:

Original (pos 1-15):ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C ... (position 1-15 refers to the first 15 nucleotides? Or need to index correctly. The way sequences are written is continuous without spacing, so need to break into codons for reading frame to spot changes.)

Original sequence:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA

So the original starts with ATG, TTT (positions 1-3, then positions 4-6 = TTC?), no.

Wait, this part is confusing. Let's approach more carefully.

Original.

First 15 nucs: positions 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT.

Mutant 1: 2nd position changes? Let me transcribe each and compare.

Original full sequence (gene) written as: 5’ ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA 3’

Let's note breaks at every three nucleotides starting from 1 (since it's the coding strand. ATG is start, so next 3 nucleotides would be TTT (positions 4-6). Then CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), etc.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’ 

Comparing sequentially:

Original' 1-3: ATG
Mutant1: 1-3: ATG (same)

Original 4-6: TTT (from original: the next three nucleotides after ATG)
However, scans of the mutant1 sequence: After ATG, TTC (TTC is "TT" followed by "C"? Let's check. The first few nucleotides of mutant1:

ATG TTC TAC GCT ...

Original began with ATG TTT CTC GCT...

So, Original, first three codons:

ATG (Met), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu)

Mutant 1 first three codons:

ATG (Met), TTC (Phe), TAC (Tyr)

Third codon changed from CTC to TAC. Let’s figure out the change: in the third codon, original has CTC (Leu), mutant1 has TAC (positions 7-9). 

Original codon third: CTC (DNA) → CUC in mRNA → Leu.

Mutant’s third codon: TAC (DNA) → UAC in mRNA → Tyr. Therefore, a missense mutation (Leu to Tyr). Whether this is damaging depends on the site’s importance, but a single amino acid substitution might not deactivate an enzyme. If the enzyme's active site is affected, maybe. But unless we know the exact structure, it's hard to say if a Leu→Tyr change would do so. But since the anti-nutritional compound is produced, maybe a single mutation isn't enough for a null? Possibly, but we need check others.

Moreover, looking further in mutant1's sequence, towards the end: at positions ... TGTCGC …TGA. Original has TGTCGT; the last nucleotide of that codon (CGT → Arg) became CGC (Arg again). It's a synonymous mutation; no effect. So perhaps the mutation in mutant1 is a missense in the third codon, replacing Leu with Tyr. Not sure if that disrupts the protein's function significantly. Possible, but perhaps.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Original starts as ATGTTTCTCGCT... so the first minor regions:

Original codons after ATG: 
nuc 4-6: TTT (Phe)
nuc7-9: CTC (Leu)
nuc10-12: GCT (Ala)
In mutant2: 
After ATG TTC TAA GCT... etc.

So, 4-6: TTC (Phe, same as Mutant1, silent). But then nuc7-9: TAA.

TAA is a stop codon (in mRNA: UAA). So in the original, at codon 3 (positions7-9) was CTC (Leu). In mutant2, the third codon becomes TAA. So in DNA, that's TAA (mRNA: UAA), which is a stop codon. 

Therefore, this would lead to a premature termination of translation, resulting in a truncated protein. If the gene produces the anti-nutritional compound. Such a premature stop could lead to a nonfunctional protein, preventing the synthesis of the compound. This would be a nonsense mutation.

Between early stop codons leading to loss of gene product. Since the problem requires elimination of the compound, which requires disabling the gene's function, mutant2's stop codon might result in a nonfunctional enzyme, hence eliminating production of the anti-nutritional compound. This seems like a strong candidate.

Mutant3:5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Compare with original: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT ...

Original:

Positions 4-6: TTT (Phe)

positions7-9: CTC (now mutant has TAC?)

Wait, original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ... 

Mutant3: ATG T T T T CGA ...

Wait, perhaps need better alignment. Breaking down:

Original breakdown:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA

Mutant3 sequence:

ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA-3'

Segments:

ATG then TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT ... 

Original has after ATG:

TTC TCT → which would correspond to positions 4-6 TTT for original? Wait, perhaps a different approach.

Looking at nucleotides: comparing characters.

Original: 5’-ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A ... 3'
Mutant3: 5’-ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T ... 

Notice insertions or changes. Looking at where the differences start:

Original after ATG (position1-3): the next TTT (positions4-6). Mutant3 is ATG TTT, then T at position7? Let me line them up.

Original positions 7-9: CTC (positions7: C,8:T,9:C)

Mutant3 at these positions: TAC (position7-9). So comparing. Original nth nucleotides:

After ATG (3 nucs):

Original: positions4-6: T T T (codon TTT: Phe)

Mutant3: positions4-6: T T T (same as original; so same first codon after Met: Phe)

positions7-9 Original: C T C (codon CTC, Leu). Perhaps Mutant3’s positions7-9 are T A C (codon TAC). So CTC → TAT (wait? The original codon is CTC (where each triplet is the 5'→3')? Wait a K, positioning.

Wait, original first codon after ATG is TTT (Phe, as we saw). Then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

But in the third codon of the original (codon 3: positions7-9, bases C T C → C in position7 is part of CTC?)

Wait perhaps the confusion.

Another approach: Step by step nucleotide comparison between original and Mutant3.

Original (1-18):

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: CTC

10-12: GCT

13-15: GGT

16-18: ACT

Mutant3 (1-24):

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT (Same)

7-9: TAC (previously CTC; that is a C→T, T→A, C→ C ??? This appears different. Let me check the exact mutation.

Original’s sequence snippet:

... T T T C T C G C T G G T A C  T ... (original’s 4-15: TTT CTC GCT GGT)

Mutant3 sequence: after ATG, T T T T A C G C T... So, insert 4th T, changing the following sequences.

Ah, perhaps here’s an insertion. Comparing:

Original: ... T T T C T C G C T ... 

Mutant3: ... T T T T A C G C T ... 

So the original fourth nucleotide (position4? Maybe need better numbering. Let me correct index:

Original sequence looks like this (showing the first parts):

Original: 5'- A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G ... -3'

Mutant3:         5'- A T G T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A ... -3'

So inserting a T after the first three T’s (after ATG).

But perhaps they're not inserting but having a point mutation and another addition.

Alternatively, original:

After ATG (positions 1-3): positions 4 T, 5 T, 6 T, 7 C, 8 T, 9 C...

Mutant3:

After ATG: 4 T, 5 T, 6 T, 7 T, 8 A, 9 C... etc.

So in positions 7,8,9: in original, they are C, T, C. In mutant3, they are T,A,C. So the first C becomes T (mutation), in position8 the T becomes A, in position9, C remains. So changing CTC (Leu) into TAC (Tyr). However, disrupting the next codons. Wait perhaps the mutation is at position7, as some as insertion or substitution.

But actually, comparing across:

Original (positions 7-9): C T C → codon CTC → Leu.

Mutant3 (positions 7-9): T A C → TAC → Tyr. So this is a point mutation changing C to T in position7, T to A in position8 (that is two consecutive substitutions: positions 7 and 8). Alternatively, may they have inserted a T somewhere causing a frameshift? For instance, inserting a T at position7 leading to a frameshift, altering downstream codons.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...

Mutant3 sequence in codons: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Hence, after the first TTT (Phe), next codon becomes TAC (Tyr), GCT still Ala, GGT (Gly), but then GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr)...

Wait, original has ACT at positions 16-18 (codon ACT → Thr). Mutant3 after GGT (positions 13-15), next three nucleotides in original should be ACT. But if in mutant3, the next nucleotides are GTC? Let’s check:

Original... GGT ACT TCT ..., which is after GGT (13-15), Original is GGT ACT ...

Mutant3 is GGT GTC ACT ...

So, altered to GTC at codon 16-18 instead of ACT.

That's a substitution. The GTC (Val) replacing ACT (Thr), but with the rest following. So there is a frameshift here? Where did the extra nucleotides come in? No, unless there's an insertion.

Looking at nucleotide positions more carefully:

Original first exones: if we look sequentially. The original is: 

ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Breaking into the actual coding:

letters:

1-3: ATG

4-6: TTT

7-9: C T C → CTC

10-12: G C T → GCT (Ala)

13-15: G G T → GGT (Gly)

16-18: A C T → ACT (Thr)

19-21: T C T → TCT (Ser)

...

Now, the mutant3 is written as:

ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

So, first codons:

ATG T T T T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T ...

Comparing to original.

In original:

position1-3: ATG

positions4-6: T T T → TTT (Phe)

position7-9: C T C → CTC (Leu)

Mutant3's 7-9: T A C → TAC (Tyr). However, in the sequence provided, after ATG, the mutant has three T's and then TAC. Wait, the sequence is four T's? The original at position 4-6: T TT C... whereas mutant has T T T T A C... How?

Wait, the original at position 4: T, 5:T,6:T (pos4-6: TTT).

Then positions7-9: first base is C (position7), T (8), C (9) → CTC.

Point mutations in mutant3 at positions7-9 (C→T, T→ A,C→?) Or perhaps insertions? Wait, in the given mutant3 sequence, after ATG:

Fourth nucleotide: T (pos4), fifth T(pos5), sixth T(pos6). So first three Ts: positions 4-6 as original (as in the first codon after ATG: So positions 4-6: TTT (same as original: TTT ⇒ Phe). Position7 in original is C. Mutant3 has another T at position7 followed by A and C. Wait, that would make the sequence:

First codon after ATG: TTT (positions4-6: still correct).

Then second codon in original: positions7-9 C T C (CTC: Leu)

In mutant3, starting from position7. If position7 is T, then the next nucleotides would be T position7, A position8, C position9. TAC.

But in terms of coding:

Then third codon GCT (positions10-12) in original), mutant3 same? Let’s check:

After TAC (codon 7-9?), then GCT in original.

In mutant3, code continues as GCTGGTGTCACT...

So after TAC,  the next three letters are GC (from 10-11?), so GCT is okay.

But looking at the subsequent codons, mutant3 has a new triplet insertion or something. Wait, maybe not. If TS only has point mutations, getting ahead… Wait, another discrepancy comes with:

Original: ...GCT GGT ACT TCT GTGG...
Mutant3: ...GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTGG...

Position13-15 in original: GGT (should be same as mutant3? not?)

Original positions 13-15 (GGT) is the same as Mutant3. Then original has ACT (position16-18), and Mutant3 has GTC at positions16-18, original ACT.

This would be substituting the original ACT (Thr) with GTC (Val). But that would be a substitution if the sequence progression is maintained. However, how the mutation happened causes this? Let's look at the DNA sequence.

If in the original:

First part: ...C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...

In mutant3:

... T A C G C T G G T G T C A C T T C T...

Here, after pos9 (changes):

Original: cont. GCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant3:            GCTGGTGT C ACTTCT...

So in the mutant3:

At position 16-18 (ACT → GTC) in original. However, in terms of nucleotides, perhaps there has been a single substitution but With . How can this mutation happen? First, original after codon TAC (mutant has at position7-9 TAC instead of CTC). Then proceeding:

Original positions 7-12: CTC GCT GGT → in mutant3 this would be TAC GCT GGT (assuming no other changes), but mutant3 actually's sequence is at codon positions TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT. Wait, hard to tell, maybe there's a T-A changed into G leading to other substitutions. 

Possibly this GTC at position16-18 is a point mutation of original ACT (Thr→Val) but also involving maybe a deletion or insertion.

Alternatively, it's possible that mutant3 has an insertion of two nucleotides, changing the frame from position rx onwards, but in the problem statement, their sequences have similar lengths. Wait, Mutant3's sequence, the full written one include "…TGT..." but visually, the length perhaps is longer?

Original gene length shown starts with:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA C ATATTT ATT GTC GT ...TGA.

Comparing Wirth mutant3's:

ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'

In writing, original seems to be:

ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... Whereas mutant3 is:

ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Looking at the altered regions in the beginning:

It appears that in mutant3, after initial ATG, there's TTTT where the original had TTT CTC. Then there's differentiation where in the first part:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Looking at the nucleotides:

Original: pos 7-9:CTC

Mutant3: pos7: inserted a T? Because ir now has TTTT A C.

Wait, if original TTT CTC → TTT TC after the ATG? Not sure, expected it's TTT CTC GCT.

Mutant3's sequence would then be inserting a T after TTT, leading to a frameshift? For instance:

Original sequence following ATG as positions 4-: T T T C T C G...

Mutant3 would be T T T T A C G...

Inserting a T after the third T (at original position7?), shifting the reading frame. Let me suppose there was insertion of a T at position7. Then:

original codon1 (after ATG): positions4-6: TTT

original codon2: 7-9: C T C → CTC (Leu)

original codon3:10-12 G C T (Ala)

Mutant3 with frame shifted:

After insertion in position7, let's number positions:

1-3 ATG = pos1-3 (ATG)

pos4: T

pos5:T

pos6:T

pos7: inserted T ⇒ new frame: 4: T, 5: T, 6: T, 7: T, 8: A, 9: C ...

new codons in mutant3 after ATG:

codon1 (4-6): T-T-T → TTT (Phe)

codon2 (7-9): T-A-C → TAC (Tyr)

codon3 (10-12): G-C-T → GCT (Ala)

Wait, but then losing align. If codon2 starts at pos7-9: TAC.

Then it's possible that the mutation here is insertion of an additional T after TTT. Insert position7 as T (original was C, then T, C). Wait, unclear.

Actually, if they've got TTT TAC..., compared to original TTT CTC..., it's an insert of an extra T and substitution of T A C in positions5-7 (if inserted T at position4?) It's confusing. Alternatively, this could be multiple point mutations.

Alternatively, There's a substitution in positions downstream.

But, consider if mutant3 introduces a T inserted in the region. Inserting a T would shift the reading frame from that point onwards. So, insertion of a T in between the TTT and CTC:

Original: ... TTT C T C ...

mutant3: ...TTTT AC...

The insertion of T after the initial TTT would change the codon after that. So insert an extra T at the end of the first codon (after TTT, insert T), leading to TTT T C ... but how does that transition to TAC?

Alternatively, Maybe the original sequence after ATG is TTTCTC..., and mutant3 has a TTTA..., altering the next codon. Given the confusion, I need to look for others.

Alternatively, perhaps in mutant3, the original sequence at the beginning have a mutated base that disrupts the reading frame. Usually, frame shifts can arise from insertions or deletions of non-multiples of three nucleotides, leading to mistranslation downstream. So if in mutant there is an insertion or deletion changing the reading frame from the start, causing altered amino acids and possibly premature stops, thereby inactivating the protein.

Alternatively, comparing original and mutant3 and look for frame shifts. For example, if there's a single nucleotide insert, starting at an earlier position.

Wait, in Mutant3:

Looking at the initial first few codons:

Original:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So mid allowing, the original codon after TTT is CTC (position7-9), then GCT(10-12), then GGT(13-15).)

In mutant3, after TTT, there's TAC (which suggests substitutes CTC with TAC (possibly replacing a triplet). But down the line, how does the sequence mutate.

The key parts: after codon GGT (positions13-15), original has ACT (Thr) (16-18), but mutant3 has GTC (Val). Then next:ACT (just like original).

This indicates that AFTER codon 16-18, original is TCT but in mutant3, we continue normally. Therefore, perhaps no frame shift, but one or more Substitutions.

However, the nucleotide change in mutant3 brings in an additional GTC. So position CTC to TAC (substitutions in positions?) Possibly two point mutations here: C->T and T->A, but sequentially, original:

Original: positions7-9: C T C ⇒ leads to CTC (Leu)

In mutant3: T A C ⇒ TAC (Tyr). Is that substitution in two positions (C→T and T→A). Maybe.

This is a missense mutation. It’s possible that would disrupt protein function, but maybe not. Whether two nucleotide changes could result in a critical section, but again depends on location.

Another possible mutation here could be a frameshift if an insertion causes a shift in the reading. Let me think: for example, a +1 frameshift.

Suppose the original sequence after ATG TT T, next C T C G C T, i.e., positions4-6 T-T-T PMC, 7-9 C-T-C.

In mutant3: after ATG TT TT. C, followed by T AAC...

This might suggest inserting an extra T between the first TTT and CTC.

Original: ATGTTT||CTC GCT...
Mutant3: ATGTTT T || TAC GCT...

Insertion of a T after position6 (after ATGTTT), giving an extra T, and then continues TAC...

That would cause a frameshift. Inserting one T would shift the reading frame from that point. In such a case, the original codon after TT T was CTC (Leu), but inserting a T makes it TT T T AC GCT...

So codons after mutation would be TTT (original Phe), then TTA (inserted T plus next two), which would be TTA (Leu), then CGG (and the rest). The original was TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), which starts off as Phe-Leu-Ala-Gly-Thr...

After the frame shift, Ma y be Phe(TTT), then TTA (Leu), then CGG (Arg), TGC (Cys), and so on. If the insertion leads to a different amino acid sequence, possibly creating a frameshifted protein. However, Frameshifts often lead to long stretches of incorrect amino acids and potential premature stop codons downstream and thus nonfunctional proteins. If that's the case, this mutant may produce a truncated or otherwise abnormal protein, thereby eliminating the problematic compound. But, seeming if the frame shift here. Given that the way the mutation is written, though, would determine whether insertion happened. For Mutant3 the DNA sequence is: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGT… which seems to start as ATG TTTTAC... Apartgtttt There are now four T's and AC futher. So, compared to original’s ATG ttt ctc… inserting a T after the first three T's would ddelayed frameshift here 0 but. Then the codons after would read like:

5'-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...-3'

Which codons would be:

- ATG (codon1: Met)

- TTT (codon2: Phe)

- TAC (codon3: Tyr)

- GCT (codon4: Ala)

- GGT (codon5: Gly)

- GTC (codon6: Val)

- ACT (codon7: Thr)

Followed by original sequences again. So no frame shift happened; instead, point mutations in the CTC→ TAC and ACT → GTC. But if this is the case, I need to check whether that leads to messed up Активатор белка.

Alternatively, maybe in the sequence written as mutant 3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGA... there is an insertion changing the reading frame. Let's suppose original:

After ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant3: ATG T T T T A C cta..., which with an extra T. SO, after ATG, next codon was TTT, in mutant3, after ATG. the first three TTT remain same (positions4-6). Then, inserting another T, making the sequence TTT-T. So in this mutant, the codon is now positions7-9 are TAC (starting from[positions7: T (inserted) A (old position7) C (old position8). Butin this case, the reading frame shifts from position7 onwards.

Therefore, the first Codon1_met, Codon2_ttt (Phe), Codon3 positions7-9 now read as TAC (Tyr), but codon3 normally spanned positions7-9, which in original was CTC (Leu). Whether this is a single insertion of T at position7? If yes, the balance nucleotide adds +1 and causes a frameshift? Or an insertion of T perhaps combined with substitution. Hmmm. In that case, the following sequence GG would shift backwards.

If there is an insertion of T after position6, the DNA becomes:

Original: ATG-T-T-T-C-T-C-G...

After insertion: ATG-T-T-T-T-C-T-C-G…

Then the triplets become.

Codon2: T-T-T → same Phe.

Codon3: T-T-C (after insertion, T at pos7, then T pos8^original tue inserted? Probably becoming something like TTC, which is Phe or similar. But perhaps this illustrate the ambiguity.

Alternatively, call it a draw each triplet again when you insert a nt:

Original Tongue after ATG)

TTther stuff just getting messy. Perhaps muta jean0.3 includes both a substitution deemed an Some in'ser On on. Challenges leads to Complex The conclusion seems risky.

Putting this aside for a moment and looking to Mutant4:

Mutant4:5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original:after ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: When I decode: after ATG, TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Comparing:

Mutant4: ...ACGCTACTTC...

Original: ...GCTGGTACTT...

Mutant4 sequence after GCT is ACT (in the sequence).

Original, after GCT was GGT, then ACT. But in Mutant4, after GCT in position 10-12, “ACT“ follows.

So, original:

GCT (position 10-12: Ala), GGT (13-15: Gly), ACT (16-18: Thr)

Mutant4:

ACG (position7-9?), actual sequence.

Err, dossier, proceed slowly.

Original has: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant 4: after ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So looks like before GCT had been changed to His perhaps. Original where.

Original positions 7-9: CTC (Leu).

Mutant4's positions7-9: TAC (Tyr), same as Mutant2 changed codons wherever. But where else... The difference is in GGT ACT TCT ... original vs GCT ACT TCT in mutant4. So mutant4 deletes GGT. Letme check original vs mutant4:

Original transcribed into sections:

ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Mutant4 is:

ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Original sequence: the portion after TGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... has "GGT" before ACT.

Mutant4: After TS= ATGTTTTACGCT,, then ACT missing the uneven ‘GGT’ part.

Looking at your sequences:

Original:

After ATG:

TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4:

TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Which means that GGT is missing: i.e., the "GGT" codon (positions13-15) corresponding to Glycine in original is absent in Mutant4. So this looks like a deletion of the GGT (three nucleotides, 13-15), leading to a deletion of the Gly at position . 

Hence, the resulting mRNA would not have those three nucleotides (resulting breaksgensesre in proteins a shrunken by one amino acid. No frame shift caused since three nucleotides were deleted (a in-frame deletion).

This deletion of three nucleotides (a codon) would simply remove one amino acid (a gly) but keep the rest intact. If the deleted Gly is important for function, perhaps compromising the enzyme. However, often single amino acid deletions may have minimal effect unless in critical regions.

Alternatively, mutant4’s sequence could.Be reconsidered as a deletion of more nucleotides. Let me to spot:

Looking at the written mutant4 sequence:ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Original gene: comparison:

Original: ATGTTT C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T ...

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACT TCTGTGGAT...| flashsolve

So after ATGTTT, original has CTC GCT GGT …

Mutant4 has TA CGCT ACT … So the TA CGCT replaces a part. How many nucleotides are in mutant compared to original in this region. to seBeyond, perhaps deletion occurr, if original is provided with 20Cs andmutant4 lacks some.

Quickly scriptwise:

Original: bases after ATG => positions4: T,5:T,6:T,C,T,C,G,C,T,G,G,T....

Mutant4: bases after ATG: positions4:T,5:T,6:T,T,A,C,G,C,T,A,C,T,T,...

Comparing these:

mutant4 pos13-15: ACT, while original pos13-15: GaG

Trateini lY, mutant4 lost the GGT three nucleotides (positions13-15 in original are GGT, which is replaced by ACT in mutant4. Wait, no. How.

Alternatively, this may be a smaller deletion.

Mutant4: appears that after TTT there’s TACGCT, skipping some part. Perhaps substitute particular codons. If crossing to compare original with mutant4.
