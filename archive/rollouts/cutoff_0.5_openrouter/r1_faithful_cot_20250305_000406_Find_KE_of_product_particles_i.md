The kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν (where the pion is stationary) can be calculated using conservation of energy and momentum.

**Given:**
- Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV
- Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV
- Neutrino (ν) is assumed massless.

**Steps:**

1. **Conservation of Energy:**  
   The total energy of the pion (at rest) is its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   This energy splits into the total energy of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]

2. **Conservation of Momentum:**  
   Since the pion is stationary, the magnitudes of the muon and neutrino momenta are equal:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation:**  
   For the muon:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
   \]  
   For the (massless) neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

4. **Solve for Momentum (p):**  
   Substitute \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p \) into the energy conservation equation:  
   \[
   m_{\pi} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p.
   \]  
   Rearrange and solve for \( p \):  
   \[
   p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}.
   \]  
   Plugging in values:  
   \[
   p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

5. **Calculate Muon Energy and KE:**  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   Muon kinetic energy:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 \, \text{MeV} - 105.7 \, \text{MeV} = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

6. **Neutrino KE:**  
   For a massless neutrino, \( KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \).

**Kinetic Energies of Product Particles:**
- **µ⁺ (muon):** \(\boxed{4.1 \, \text{MeV}}\)
- **ν (neutrino):** \(\boxed{29.8 \, \text{MeV}}\)

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay process where a positive pion (Pi+) at rest decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible, right? I remember neutrinos have very tiny masses, but in many physics problems, especially at this level, they are assumed to be massless. So maybe I can take the neutrino's mass as zero here. 

Alright, since the pion is initially at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. When it decays into the muon and the neutrino, the total energy must be conserved. Also, momentum should be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero, so the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me write down the conservation laws. For energy: the total energy of the muon plus the energy of the neutrino must equal the rest energy of the pion. So,

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

And for momentum: the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) must equal the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum (p_nu), but directions are opposite. So,

p_mu = p_nu

Since the neutrino is (effectively) massless, its energy is just E_nu = p_nu c. But since we are working in units where c=1 (as common in particle physics), then E_nu = p_nu.

For the muon, the energy is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. Again, with c=1, this simplifies to E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

So now, substituting E_nu from the momentum conservation into the energy equation:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 MeV = sqrt(p_mu^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2) + p_nu

But p_mu = p_nu because momentum conservation, so substitute p_nu with p_mu:

139.6 MeV = sqrt(p_mu^2 + (105.7)^2) + p_mu

Hmm, here I need to solve for p_mu. Let me set up the equations properly.

Let me denote p = p_mu for simplicity:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p

Let me rearrange this equation:

sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) = 139.6 - p

Now square both sides:

p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2

Expanding the right side:

p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p

Now solve for p:

2*139.6*p = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2

So,

p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2*139.6)

Calculate this.

First compute 139.6 squared: 139.6^2 = ?

Let me compute 140^2 = 19600; subtract 0.4*2*140 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 139.6 squared is (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Hmm, yes.

Similarly, 105.7^2. Maybe approximate or compute:

100^2 = 10000. 5.7^2=32.49. 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So (100 + 5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49. So 105.7^2 = 11172.49.

So, 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's compute that. 19488 - 11172 = 8316. Then subtract the decimals: 0.16 -0.49 = -0.33, so 8316 -0.33 = 8315.67.

Hence, p = 8315.67 / (2*139.6)

Compute denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me do this division.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100 to make it 83.1567 / 2.792.

But let me do directly:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376, subtract 279.2: 8376 -279.2=8096.8. Hmm, 29?

Wait 279.2*30=8376. That's higher than 8315.67. So maybe 29.8.

Let's do 279.2*x = 8315.67. So x = 8315.67 /279.2 ≈ Let me compute 8315/279.2.

279.2*30=8376

But 8315 is less. So 30 - (8376 -8315)/279.2 = 30 -61/279.2≈30 -0.218≈29.782. So approximately 29.78 MeV/c (since energy and momentum in these units are related with factors of c, but units here are in MeV, assuming c=1, as is standard).

So p≈29.78 MeV/c

Wait, but why p is in MeV/c? If we set c=1, then p is in units of MeV/c, but maybe here since we are using natural units where c=1, momentum has units of MeV. Hmm, perhaps m=105.7 MeV/c², so with E in MeV, pc would be MeV, and then with c=1, p is in MeV/c. Hmmm, Maybe to convert units.

Alternatively, since in the equations E_pi is in MeV, m_mu is in MeV/c², so perhaps in natural units where c=1, mass is E/c², which is all complicated. Wait.

But given that in particle physics, normally, when masses are given in MeV, it's actually MeV/c², but since c=1 is often used, they just write the mass as MeV. Similarly momentum is expressed in MeV/c, but with c=1, p is in MeV. So I think in these units, the momentum here p_mu would be 29.78 MeV.

Anyway, moving on.

Once we have p_mu, we can find the energy of the muon. The total energy of the muon is sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2).

We had m_mu=105.7 MeV. So E_mu = sqrt(29.78^2 + 105.7^2).

Calculate this.

First, 105.7 squared is approximately 105.7*105.7: 100*105.7=10570, 5.7*105.7=598.49, so total 10570 +598.49=11168.49. Additionally, 29.78^2 is approx 29^2=841, 0.78^2=0.6084, and cross term 2*29*0.78=45.24, so total 841 +45.24 +0.6084≈886.8484.

Therefore, sqrt(886.8484 + 11168.49) = sqrt(12055.33) ≈ let's see.

Compute sqrt(12055.33). Since 110^2 = 12100, so the square root is just a bit less than 110. 110^2 is 12100, so 12100 -12055.33 =44.67. So sqrt(12055.33) ≈ 110 - 44.67/(2*110) ≈ 110 - 0.203 ≈ 109.8. So E_mu ≈109.8 MeV.

But wait this gives E_mu as approximately 109.8, which is only a bit higher than the rest mass of 105.7, so the Kinetic energy would be roughly 4.1 MeV? But let's see.

But actually wait. The kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu. So if E_mu ≈109.8, and m_mu is 105.7, which gives a KE of about 4.1 MeV.

But wait my approx of the square root might not be accurate. Let me compute sqrt(12055.33) more accurately.

Alternatively, considering:

109^2 = 11881

110^2 = 12100

11881 < 12055.33 < 12100

So difference between 109^2 and 110^2 is 219. 12055.33 -11881=174.33. So the square root is 109 + 174.33/219≈109 + 0.796≈109.796. So sqrt(12055.33)≈approx109.796 MeV.

So E_mu≈109.8 MeV.

Thus the kinetic energy KE = E_mu - m_mu ≈109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV

But that's seems low. Let me check my calculation again.

The pion rest mass is 139.6 MeV. The muon rest mass is 105.7. The neutrino is massless.

Conservation of energy must hold E_pi = E_mu + E_nu. Since E_pi = m_pi * c², but in rest frame, it's 139.6 MeV. The products must have total energy 139.6. The momentum of the pion is zero, so momentum of muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite.

But let me check this again, sometimes dividing in approximate steps can lead to errors.

Wait, maybe I made miscalculation in 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.

Let me recalculate it exactly.

139.6^2:

139.6 *139.6.

Let's compute this:

First compute 140*139.6=140*(140 -0.4)=140^2 -140*0.4=19600 -56=19544. Then subtract 0.4*139.6: 0.4*139.6=55.84.

Thus, 140*139.6 -0.4*139.6= (140 -0.4)*139.6=139.6*139.6=19544 -55.84=19488.16, correct.

105.7^2:

105.7 *105.7.

Break into (100 +5.7)^2=100^2 +2*100*5.7 +5.7^2=10000 +1140 +32.49=10000+1140=11140+32.49=11172.49. Correct.

Thus 139.6^2 -105.7^2=19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

Therefore numerator is 8315.67 and denominator is 2*139.6=279.2.

Thus p=8315.67/279.2. Let me compute that division more accurately.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me first see that 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8

279.2 × 30 = 8376.0, which is as before.

Difference between 8315.67 and8096.8 is 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

How many times 279.2 fits into218.87 => 0.783 ≈.

Thus p=29.78 MeV/c (as before).

Then E_mu= sqrt(p² +m_mu²)=sqrt(29.78² +105.7²).

Rather than approximate, use exact values:

29.78^2 is 29.78*29.78:

Calculate 30*29.78= 893.4, minus 0.22*29.78≈ 6.5516, so approx 893.4 -6.5516≈886.848. Plus (as above, okay).

105.7^2=11172.49.

Total inside square root: 886.848 +11172.49≈12059.33

Wait, 8315.67/p needed exact? Well earlier, we had difference arises because possible rounding.

But let's take exact value:

Wait, we have:

p is 8315.67 / 279.2= approximately 8315.67 ÷279.2≈29.783 MeV/c

Assuming c=1, so p=29.783 MeV.

But we can carry more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use fractions: 8315.67 /279.2 = ?

Compute as decimal division:

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me write it as 8315.67 ÷279.2 = ? 

Well, 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8 

Remainder: 8315.67 -8096.8 =218.87

218.87 / 279.2 ≈0.7838

Thus total is ≈29.7838, so p≈29.7838 MeV.

Then square of p: (29.7838)^2 ≈ approx 887.0.

Wait, 29.7838^2 = (29 +0.7838)^2 =29² + 2*29*0.7838 +0.7838²

29²=841; 2*29*0.7838≈58 *0.7838≈58*0.7=40.6, 58*0.0838≈4.86, so total ≈45.46; 0.7838²≈0.614

Sum:841+45.46+0.614≈887.07..

So 887.07; add to m_mu²=11172.49 

Total inside sqrt: 887.07 +11172.49≈12059.56

So sqrt(12059.56)= approx since 109²=11881; 110²=12100; 12059.56 is 12059.56 –11881=178.56 above 109². Then sqrt(11881 +178.56)= sqrt(12059.56)=109 +178.56/(2*109) ≈109 + 0.819≈109.819.

So 109.819 MeV is E_mu.

So the kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu =109.819 -105.7=4.119 MeV. So approximately 4.12 MeV.

But maybe we can leave it as 4.1 MeV perhaps? But the exact calculation.

Alternatively, using the exact expression for kinetic energy.

But wait, perhaps there is a formula for the kinetic energy of the muon in pion decay.

But since we did the steps, then KE_mu≈4.12 MeV. But this seems really low. But given that pion is much heavier than muon, but most of the energy is given to the neutrino since it's highly relativistic. Wait, indeed neutrinos get a significant portion of the energy. So in this case, even though the rest mass is 105.7, which is most of the pion's mass, but the remaining.

Wait, perhaps let me check it here.

The total energy of the system is 139.6.

Of this, the muon's rest mass is 105.7. The remaining energy is 139.6 -105.7=33.9 MeV. But how much of that is kinetic energy.  Hmm.

But the previous result is only about 4.1 MeV. Huh, so there is 4.1 MeV KE for the muon and then 33.9 –4.1 ≈29.8 MeV energy for the neutrino, which matches our calculation p=29.8 MeV, since for the neutrino with m=0, E_nu=p_nu*c= p=29.8 MeV.

Alternatively, the numbers make sense. The pion decays into a muon and a neutrino. The energy spent on the muon's rest mass is about 105.7, and the remaining energy distribution is split as KE between muon and neutrino. To get the maximum KE, but since the masses aren't equal, most of the kinetic energy goes to the lighter particle? But the neutrino is nearly massless, so it carries away more kinetic energy. Hence in this scenario, the muon would have small kinetic energy, and the neutrino has the majority. So actually the KE of the muon is about 4 MeV, and the neutrino KE is about 29.8 MeV. But wait, neutral with m=0 has KE= E_nu=29.8 in this case. Wait but since neutrino is massless, its KE=E since KE=E - m, and m=0. So yes, that's right, total energy equals its KE.

Thus, the kinetic energy of the muon is approx4.1 MeV.

But let's check via another approach. Let's attempt to derive the kinetic energy formula.

Considering the decay at rest:

Total energy: m_pi = sqrt( p_mu² +m_mu² ) +p_nu

But p_nu=p_mu, as momentum conservation.

So m_pi = sqrt(p² +m_mu² ) +p

Let me do this derivation again.

Express as m_pi - p = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 )

Square both sides:

m_pi² -2 m_pi p +p² = p² +m_mu^2

Simplify:

m_pi² -2 m_pi p = m_mu²

Then,

-2 m_pi p = m_mu^2 -m_pi^2

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu²

So,

p= (m_pi² -m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )

So substituting numbers:

m_pi=139.6, m_mu=105.7.

Calculating numerator: 139.6² -105.7²= (139.6 –105.7)(139.6 +105.7)= 33.9 *245.3

Compute 33.9*245.3 Let's compute this:

33.9×200=6780

33.9×45.3=33.9×40=1356; 33.9×5.3=179.67; so total 1356+179.67=1535.67

So total numerator:6780+1535.67= 8315.67, which is same as we had before.

Then divide by denominator (2*m_pi)=2*139.6=279.2.

Thus p=8315.67 /279.2≈29.78 MeV/c. (Hence, confirming previous result.)

So then E_mu= sqrt( p^2 + m_mu² )=sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2 )≈sqrt(887+11172)≈sqrt(12059)≈109.8 MeV. Subtract m_mu gives KE≈4.1MeV. 

Another cross-check: the total energy given to the products is E_mu=109.8 and E_nu≈29.78. Adding them gives approximate 139.58 MeV which is very close to the original 139.6, allowing for rounding errors. So this is consistent.

Thus, the kinetic energy of the muon is about4.1 MeV. Perhaps approximate becomes 4.12 with more precise calculation.

But if we want to carry through more significant figures.

Given p= (139.6² –105.7² )/(2*139.6)= (19488.16 –11172.49)/279.2 =8315.67 /279.2

Computing 8315.67 /279.2. Let's do:

279.2×29.78=279.2*30 -279.2*0.22=8376 –61.424=8314.576.

So 29.78 gives 8314.576. Difference. 8315.67–8314.576=1.094. Remainder 1.094/279.2≈0.0039 So p=29.7839 MeV.

Then E_mu= sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 )=sqrt( 29.7839² +105.7² )

Calculate 29.7839²:

29.7839*29.7839≈let’s compute this.

29*29=841, 29*0.7839≈22.73, 0.7839*29≈22.73, and 0.7839^2≈0.614.

Wait >:< precise? Wait  a=30 -0.2161. So (30 -0.2161)^2=900 -2*30*0.2161 +0.2161²=900 -12.966 +0.046=900-12.966=887.034 +0.046≈887.08

So well approximately 887.08.

Thus, sqrt(887.08 +11172.49)= sqrt(12059.57)= sqrt(12059.57).

Using precise calculation:

109.8²=(110 -0.2)^2=110² -2*110*0.2 +0.2²=12100 –44 +0.04=12056.04

That differs from 12059.57 by around 3.53. So find how much over.

Next, find x such that (109.8 +x)^2=12059.57

Compute (109.8 +x)^2= 109.8² +2*109.8 x +x²=12056.04 +219.6x +x².

Set that equal to 12059.57:

12056.04 +219.6x +x²=12059.57

=> 219.6x +x²=3.53

Assuming x² is negligible:

219.6x ≈3.53 →x≈3.53/219.6≈0.01607

So (109.8+0.01607)^2≈109.81607^2≈12056.04 +2*109.8*0.01607 + (0.01607)^2≈12056.04+3.53≈12059.57. Correct.

Thus E_mu=109.816 MeV.

Thus KE=109.816 -105.7=4.116 MeV. So approximately 4.116 MeV. Rounding to three decimal digits:4.12 MeV.

So the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately4.12 MeV. The Neutrino gets the rest, which is  139.6 -109.816=29.784 MeV.

Therefore, writer mentions may need to give the answer as 4.12 MeV. However, maybe the problem expects an exact expression, possibly in terms of square roots. Let me check.

If you don't assume nutrino mass is zero, which could complicate, but I think they usually do. So write fraction:

KE_mu= E_mu -m_mu=m_pi -E_nu -m_mu

But since p= m_pi² - m_mu² / (2m_pi)

E_mu= sqrt( p² +m_mu² )

But made case, predicted value.

Alternatively: using the equation (from relativistic kinematics)

Energy of the muon in this situation is (m_pi² +m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )

No:

Wait, we know E_mu= sqrt( p² +m_mu² )

and p= (m_pi² -m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi )

so substitute:

E_mu= sqrt( [ (m_pi² -m_mu²)^2/(4m_pi²) ] + m_mu² )

= sqrt( [ (m_pi² -m_mu²)^2 +4 m_pi² m_mu² ] / (4 m_pi²) )

Expand the numerator:

(m_pi² -m_mu²)^2 +4 m_pi² m_mu²= m_pi^4 -2 m_pi² m_mu² +m_mu^4 +4 m_pi² m_mu²= m_pi^4 +2m_pi² m_mu² +m_mu^4= (m_pi^2 +m_mu^2 )^2.

So num= (m_pi² +m_mu² )^2; den=4 m_pi² so sqrt becomes (m_pi² +m_mu² )/(2m_pi )

Therefore,

E_mu= (m_pi² +m_mu² ) / (2m_pi )

Hence KE_mu=E_mu -m_mu= [ (m_pi² +m_mu²) / (2m_pi ) ] -m_mu= [m_pi² +m_mu² -2 m_pi m_mu ]/(2m_pi )

This can be written as (m_pi- m_mu )² / (2m_pi). Because expanding (m_pi -m_mu )² = m_pi² -2m_pi m_mu +m_mu²

Hence:

KE_mu=(m_pi -m_mu )^2/(2m_pi )

Wow, that's a nice formula! So plugging in m_pi=139.6; m_mu=105.7,

So (139.6-105.7)^2/(2*139.6)= (33.9)^2/(2*139.6)= 1149.21 /279.20≈4.116 MeV, which matches our previous result!

Therefore, exact answer is 4.116MeV, perhaps rounds to 4.12 or so. The problem gives rest masses to one decimal place. Thus, 139.6 and 105.7. Let's compute with full decimals:

Difference squared:

(139.6 -105.7)=33.9¬ so square=33.9×33.9=1149.21

Divide by (2×139.6)=279.2

1149.21 /279.2=4.116 approximately. But to rational fraction:

1149.21 /279.2= exactly? Let's use same calculation. 279.2 ×4=1116.8, which gives 4 ×279.2=1116.8

1149.21 -1116.8=32.41 left. 32.41 /279.2 approx 0.116. Thus total is 4.116 MeV. Exact is (33.9)^2 / (2*139.6). Therefore, using original numbers: 

139.6 -105.7=33.9

So (33.9)^2 is 33.9×33.9. Let's compute it precisely:

33*33=1089, 33*0.9=29.7, 0.9*33=29.7, 0.9*0.9=0.81

So (33 +0.9)^2=1089 + 29.7 + 29.7 +0.81=1089 +59.4 +0.81=1149.21, which we already know.

Therefore, KE=1149.21/(2×139.6)= 1149.21 /279.2 as above.

So if utilizing the formula, the KE is (m_pi -m_mu )²/(2m_pi )

Is that right? That seems familiar.

So has the calculation, got the precision≈4.116.

But still.

Maybe the answer expects the exact form as well. Alternatively, evaluating fractions:

1149.21 /279.2=?

Ok M=139.6

TMI the calculation problem.But the answer is approximately 4.12 MeV. Given the rest masses are in one decimal, the answer would be given to something like 4.1 MeV.

Alternatively, using the formula with cubed numbers:

Alternatively, let's check standard problem.

In the decay a pion at rest to mu and nu, the kinetic energy of the muon is( (m_pi -m_mu ) ^2 )/(2 m_pi )

Formula: yes see via Wikipedia Pi-mu decay and comparison. Yes, problem in particle physics standard for this decay; the kinetic energy of muon is is calculated as above.

Hence the calculation is drive bush to arrive at approximately4.12 MeV.

But in any case, stepping back:

when you see answer particles have their KE:

But the problem states: "Find KE of product particles", plural. So possibly, the kinetic energy of each product. Apply the same analysis:

The pion at rest decays into mu+ and nu. What is the KE of each. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is all KE, so its KE is E_nu= p_nu= ~29.78 MeV. But the question ask for product particles—sometimes even if the neutrino is involved. So do they want both KE_mu and KE_nu, or just for the muon? The question statement says “product particles” so possibly both.

But looking at the problem name in statement, but edited by User: the actual question is:

"Find KE of product particles in,

Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu 

here Pi(+) is stationary.

Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

The condition that Pi is stationary. So probably they mean the KE of both products. But usually, Unless specified otherwise, usually books are if asking for KE in pion decay, they have in mind just the muon? Because neutrino is harder to measure, but the problem might require both.

But the problem says "product particles"—plural. So they may require that.

Ah! Wait. Since there are two product particles, mu+ and neutrino. So the total sum of their KEs is probably assigned. Maybe the question is seeking the KE of each, or only the KE of the massive particle.

But, as per directions, original problem is translated from another language (“Find KE of product particles... here Pi+ si stationary”) translated from: no, maybe the User wrote that. Hmmm ambiguous.

But going back to that original calculation. If the neutrino's KE is E_nu=29.784 MeV.

However, wait the total energy is 139.6 MeV which splits into E_mu=109.816 and E_nu=29.784, which sum to approx 139.6. The neutrino is KE all but the muon's KE is ~4.1, but in such cases, (kE_mu=4.11, KE_nu=29.78). But in prompt, whether the neutrino's KE is required? Hmm? The problem says “Find KE of product particles”, which plural. How many Products are "particles"— one is mu+, the other one is neutrino.

But they may assume thet KE is referring to the muon only, as (almost) all physics questions in decays usually Concern for charged leptons/ baryons (detectable particles), whereas neutrinos’s KE is hard to detect. But as per problem statement express, suppose we are to express the KE of the muon and the neutrino.

Problem is here indeed instructing "Find KE of product particles", both the mu+ and thenu. Kaon decay into mu and neutrino.

Thus in that case, the answers would be KE_mu≈4.1 MeV and KE_nu=29.78 MeV.

But rest energyotherwise the problem says "rest mass of Pi+ & mu+ is 139.6 & 105.7 MeV". Rest masses implies neutrino here is massless. Hence its KE is same as itsenergy.

But user instruction says "find KE".

But perhaps how convention works. If a particle is massless, floor its kinetic energy is its total energy, since K=E -mc² and m=0, so KE=E. Therefore in compatation.

Hence in this case, product particles:

-Mu+: KE=4.116 MeV

-Neutrino: KE=29.78 MeV.

But no, how the problem's target, since Product particles are two. However, perhaps defied-particles visible.

But perhaps in common problems, for pion decay at rest, mu's Kinetic energy is typically calculated by (“ mu's KE is about 4.1 MeV). Insert ST question might permits only the the .

But in the problem, since giving rest mass of Pa+ & Also  sign, and use code Numeric->question about.

Thus, in that case, we maybe needs to write both ke. But recall that the model might result only 1 number. Wait box in examplesometimes via the product particles makes us to sum KE. But the problem says "kinetic energy of product particles”.

Another way: check if the given data for the problem in variegated university resembles sample shows https://www.phys.ksu.edu/personal/wysin/notes/piondecay.pdf which gives E_mu and E_nu, where etc.

But since pion decays into mu and nu:

 the solution uses conservation of energy and momentum to get answers. Generally.

But as per calculations abowe, K.E of mu is ~4.12 MeV and KE of neutrino ≈29.78 MeV. However, expands as a vector ?

But submitted answer expected in Boxed Something.

If problem expects Balled 100es, total KE would be from products:mu+ nu. Total KE=4.12+29.78≈33.9 MeV. of the pion's rest mass.

But validity, as pion's rest mass is 139.6. Then total energy is, the rest mass of pion equals the sum of mu energy and neutrino's energy =>139.6=105.7(rest) + KE_mu + 0(rest) + KE_nu,(if neutrio is massless). Thus KE total is 139.6 -105.7=33.9 which 4.12 +29.78 as above. But in such case, the question is "find KE ofproduct particlered," which is 33.9 MeV. But you split between mu and the guys. So conioion of Problem requirements???

But additional input from user wrote "Find KE of product particles...".

Hm ambiguous. Well, the standard question teach. The kinetic energy of the mu mu in  pion decay ID jet recipes, 

e.g., see hyperphysics:...
Ok, for example http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Particles/piondec.html

Which says:

"The positive pion decays into a muon and a muon neutrino... The total decay energy is about 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. That provides plenty of energjuice......"

eh, but the Kinetic energy is split among the mu and neutrino.

But confusions met as non-relativistic and that most the energy goes to the neutrino. Yes.

Therefore returning back to the calculation. The answeras per standard procedure the kinetic energy of the muon is= (m_pi – m_mu )²/( 2 m_pi )

Which done, as we did, gives then units in MeV.

But it may be expected tocompute this:

Equation,

KE= (139.6-105.7)^2 / (2*139.6 )≈(33.9)^2 /279.2≈1149.21/279.2≈4.116 MeV.

Rounding to three significant figures given the m_pi and m_mu are Up to four. Whether the answer should be four sig fig? m_pi&m_mu are expressed as 139.6 and 105.7 which is four sig figs. Then, 33.9 or3 significant figs. 33.9*33.9= one-leading to three? But the result of 1149.21 has five.sig.fig.

divirged comes -CCC (Likely aims for me)\

Ah, but everything probably similar 4.1 MeV. But calculation breaks down to yes' more precise.

But upon seeing the exact computation, using the formula.

Wait exactly.

(m_pi -m_mu )²/(2 m_pi )=(139.6 -105.7 )^2 / (2 *139.6 )

messing (139.6 and 105.7 have one decimal point.)

139.6 ±0.05

105.7 ±0.05

Hence 139.6-105.7 =33.9 ±0.1 mev.

Hence (33.9 ±0.1)²= 33.9² +0.2×33.9×0.1 +0.01≈1149.21 +6.78 +0.01≈1149.21 +6.79≈1156→ with uncertainty sqrt((δx)^2 + (δy)^2)???? Not sure, but uncertainty ≈ ± (2*33.9*0.1 +0.1^2 ≈6.78+0.01=6.79). Unguided stuff.

Hence, retuned, (33.9 ± 0.1)^2= (33.9 ±0.1)^2=1156±something. Hence, our p over in calculation m_over, but the previous record still plays => errors and we gives possible lowey, but ultimately the result.

The answer essentially approximately4.1 MeV for the muon, with the de However, ambiguous problem statement. Nonetheless, drilling down 240mg

But I think because neutrino's Kinetic energy is much larger than or e people barely cares, but since the precise answer for mu Kinetic is ~4.1 MeV. Rest based on the given instructions.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay process where a positive pion (Pi+) at rest decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is considered negligible, right? I remember neutrinos have very tiny masses, but in many physics problems, especially at this level, they are assumed to be massless. So maybe I can take the neutrino's mass as zero here. 

Alright, since the pion is initially at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. When it decays into the muon and the neutrino, the total energy must be conserved. Also, momentum should be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero, so the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me write down the conservation laws. For energy: the total energy of the muon plus the energy of the neutrino must equal the rest energy of the pion. So,

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

And for momentum: the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) must equal the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum (p_nu), but directions are opposite. So,

p_mu = p_nu

Since the neutrino is (effectively) massless, its energy is just E_nu = p_nu c. But since we are working in units where c=1 (as common in particle physics), then E_nu = p_nu.

For the muon, the energy is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. Again, with c=1, this simplifies to E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

So now, substituting E_nu from the momentum conservation into the energy equation:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 MeV = sqrt(p_mu^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2) + p_nu

But p_mu = p_nu because momentum conservation, so substitute p_nu with p_mu:

139.6 MeV = sqrt(p_mu^2 + (105.7)^2) + p_mu

Hmm, here I need to solve for p_mu. Let me set up the equations properly.

Let me denote p = p_mu for simplicity:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p

Let me rearrange this equation:

sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) = 139.6 - p

Now square both sides:

p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2

Expanding the right side:

p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6*p

Now solve for p:

2*139.6*p = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2

So,

p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2*139.6)

Calculate this.

First compute 139.6 squared: 139.6^2 = ?

Let me compute 140^2 = 19600; subtract 0.4*2*140 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 139.6 squared is (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Hmm, yes.

Similarly, 105.7^2. Maybe approximate or compute:

100^2 = 10000. 5.7^2=32.49. 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So (100 + 5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49. So 105.7^2 = 11172.49.

So, 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's compute that. 19488 - 11172 = 8316. Then subtract the decimals: 0.16 -0.49 = -0.33, so 8316 -0.33 = 8315.67.

Hence, p = 8315.67 / (2*139.6)

Compute denominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me do this division.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100 to make it 83.1567 / 2.792.

But let me do directly:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376, subtract 279.2: 8376 -279.2=8096.8. Hmm, 29?

Wait 279.2*30=8376. That's higher than 8315.67. So maybe 29.8.

Let's do 279.2*x = 8315.67. So x = 8315.67 /279.2 ≈ Let me compute 8315/279.2.

279.2*30=8376

But 8315 is less. So 30 - (8376 -8315)/279.2 = 30 -61/279.2≈30 -0.218≈29.782. So approximately 29.78 MeV/c (since energy and momentum in these units are related with factors of c, but units here are in MeV, assuming c=1, as is standard).

So p≈29.78 MeV/c

Wait, but why p is in MeV/c? If we set c=1, then p is in units of MeV/c, but maybe here since we are using natural units where c=1, momentum has units of MeV. Hmm, perhaps m=105.7 MeV/c², so with E in MeV, pc would be MeV, and then with c=1, p is in MeV/c. Hmmm, Maybe to convert units.

Alternatively, since in the equations E_pi is in MeV, m_mu is in MeV/c², so perhaps in natural units where c=1, mass is E/c², which is all complicated. Wait.

But given that in particle physics, normally, when masses are given in MeV, it's actually MeV/c², but since c=1 is often used, they just write the mass as MeV. Similarly momentum is expressed in MeV/c, but with c=1, p is in MeV. So I think in these units, the momentum here p_mu would be 29.78 MeV.

Anyway, moving on.

Once we have p_mu, we can find the energy of the muon. The total energy of the muon is sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2).

We had m_mu=105.7 MeV. So E_mu = sqrt(29.78^2 + 105.7^2).

Calculate this.

First, 105.7 squared is approximately 105.7*105.7: 100*105.7=10570, 5.7*105.7=598.49, so total 10570 +598.49=11168.49. Additionally, 29.78^2 is approx 29^2=841, 0.78^2=0.6084, and cross term 2*29*0.78=45.24, so total 841 +45.24 +0.6084≈886.8484.

Therefore, sqrt(886.8484 + 11168.49) = sqrt(12055.33) ≈ let's see.

Compute sqrt(12055.33). Since 110^2 = 12100, so the square root is just a bit less than 110. 110^2 is 12100, so 12100 -12055.33 =44.67. So sqrt(12055.33) ≈ 110 - 44.67/(2*110) ≈ 110 - 0.203 ≈ 109.8. So E_mu ≈109.8 MeV.

But wait this gives E_mu as approximately 109.8, which is only a bit higher than the rest mass of 105.7, so the Kinetic energy would be roughly 4.1 MeV? But let's see.

But actually wait. The kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu. So if E_mu ≈109.8, and m_mu is 105.7, which gives a KE of about 4.1 MeV.

But wait my approx of the square root might not be accurate. Let me compute sqrt(12055.33) more accurately.

Alternatively, considering:

109^2 = 11881

110^2 = 12100

11881 < 12055.33 < 12100

So difference between 109^2 and 110^2 is 219. 12055.33 -11881=174.33. So the square root is 109 + 174.33/219≈109 + 0.796≈109.796. So sqrt(12055.33)≈approx109.796 MeV.

So E_mu≈109.8 MeV.

Thus the kinetic energy KE = E_mu - m_mu ≈109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV

But that's seems low. Let me check my calculation again.

The pion rest mass is 139.6 MeV. The muon rest mass is 105.7. The neutrino is massless.

Conservation of energy must hold E_pi = E_mu + E_nu. Since E_pi = m_pi * c², but in rest frame, it's 139.6 MeV. The products must have total energy 139.6. The momentum of the pion is zero, so momentum of muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite.

But let me check this again, sometimes dividing in approximate steps can lead to errors.

Wait, maybe I made miscalculation in 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.

Let me recalculate it exactly.

139.6^2:

139.6 *139.6.

Let's compute this:

First compute 140*139.6=140*(140 -0.4)=140^2 -140*0.4=19600 -56=19544. Then subtract 0.4*139.6: 0.4*139.6=55.84.

Thus, 140*139.6 -0.4*139.6= (140 -0.4)*139.6=139.6*139.6=19544 -55.84=19488.16, correct.

105.7^2:

105.7 *105.7.

Break into (100 +5.7)^2=100^2 +2*100*5.7 +5.7^2=10000 +1140 +32.49=10000+1140=11140+32.49=11172.49. Correct.

Thus 139.6^2 -105.7^2=19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

Therefore numerator is 8315.67 and denominator is 2*139.6=279.2.

Thus p=8315.67/279.2. Let me compute that division more accurately.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me first see that 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8

279.2 × 30 = 8376.0, which is as before.

Difference between 8315.67 and8096.8 is 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

How many times 279.2 fits into218.87 => 0.783 ≈.

Thus p=29.78 MeV/c (as before).

Then E_mu= sqrt(p² +m_mu²)=sqrt(29.78² +105.7²).

Rather than approximate, use exact values:

29.78^2 is 29.78*29.78:

Calculate 30*29.78= 893.4, minus 0.22*29.78≈ 6.5516, so approx 893.4 -6.5516≈886.848. Plus (as above, okay).

105.7^2=11172.49.

Total inside square root: 886.848 +11172.49≈12059.33

Wait, 8315.67/p needed exact? Well earlier, we had difference arises because possible rounding.

But let's take exact value:

Wait, we have:

p is 8315.67 / 279.2= approximately 8315.67 ÷279.2≈29.783 MeV/c

Assuming c=1, so p=29.783 MeV.

But we can carry more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use fractions: 8315.67 /279.2 = ?

Compute as decimal division:

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me write it as 8315.67 ÷279.2 = ? 

Well, 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8 

Remainder: 8315.67 -8096.8 =218.87

218.87 / 279.2 ≈0.7838

Thus total is ≈29.7838, so p≈29.7838 MeV.

Then square of p: (29.7838)^2 ≈ approx 887.0.

Wait, 29.7838^2 = (29 +0.7838)^2 =29² + 2*29*0.7838 +0.7838²

29²=841; 2*29*0.7838≈58 *0.7838≈58*0.7=40.6, 58*0.0838≈4.86, so total ≈45.46; 0.7838²≈0.614

Sum:841+45.46+0.614≈887.07..

So 887.07; add to m_mu²=11172.49 

Total inside sqrt: 887.07 +11172.49≈12059.56

So sqrt(12059.56)= approx since 109²=11881; 110²=12100; 12059.56 is 12059.56 –11881=178.56 above 109². Then sqrt(11881 +178.56)= sqrt(12059.56)=109 +178.56/(2*109) ≈109 + 0.819≈109.819.

So 109.819 MeV is E_mu.

So the kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu =109.819 -105.7=4.119 MeV. So approximately 4.12 MeV.

But maybe we can leave it as 4.1 MeV perhaps? But the exact calculation.

Alternatively, using the exact expression for kinetic energy.

But wait, perhaps there is a formula for the kinetic energy of the muon in pion decay.

But since we did the steps, then KE_mu≈4.12 MeV. But this seems really low. But given that pion is much heavier than muon, but most of the energy is given to the neutrino since it's highly relativistic. Wait, indeed neutrinos get a significant portion of the energy. So in this case, even though the rest mass is 105.7, which is most of the pion's mass, but the remaining.

Wait, perhaps let me check it here.

The total energy of the system is 139.6.

Of this, the muon's rest mass is 105.7. The remaining energy is 139.6 -105.7=33.9 MeV. But how much of that is kinetic energy.  Hmm.

But the previous result is only about 4.1 MeV. Huh, so there is 4.1 MeV KE for the muon and then 33.9 –4.1 ≈29.8 MeV energy for the neutrino, which matches our calculation p=29.8 MeV, since for the neutrino with m=0, E_nu=p_nu*c= p=29.8 MeV.

Alternatively, the numbers make sense. The pion decays into a muon and a neutrino. The energy spent on the muon's rest mass is about 105.7, and the remaining energy distribution is split as KE between muon and neutrino. To get the maximum KE, but since the masses aren't equal, most of the kinetic energy goes to the lighter particle? But the neutrino is nearly massless, so it carries away more kinetic energy. Hence in this scenario, the muon would have small kinetic energy, and the neutrino has the majority. So actually the KE of the muon is about 4 MeV, and the neutrino KE is about 29.8 MeV. But wait, neutral with m=0 has KE= E_nu=29.8 in this case. Wait but since neutrino is massless, its KE=E since KE=E - m, and m=0. So yes, that's right, total energy equals its KE.

Thus, the kinetic energy of the muon is approx4.1 MeV.

But let's check via another approach. Let's attempt to derive the kinetic energy formula.

Considering the decay at rest:

Total energy: m_pi = sqrt( p_mu² +m_mu² ) +p_nu

But p_nu=p_mu, as momentum conservation.

So m_pi = sqrt(p² +m_mu² ) +p

Let me do this derivation again.

Express as m_pi - p = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 )

Square both sides:

m_pi² -2 m_pi p +p² = p² +m_mu^2

Simplify:

m_pi² -2 m_pi p = m_mu²

Then,

-2 m_pi p = m_mu^2 -m_pi^2

Multiply both sides by -1:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu²

So,

p= (m_pi² -m_mu²)/(2 m_pi )

So substituting numbers:

m_pi=139.6, m_mu=105.7.

Calculating numerator: 139.6² -105.7²= (139.6 –105.7)(139.6 +105.7)= 33.9 *245.3

Compute 33.9*245.3 Let's compute this:

33.9×200=6780

33.9×45.3=33.9×40=1356; 33.9×5.3=179.67; so total 1356+179.67=1535.67

So total numerator:6780+1535.67= 8315.67, which is same as we had before.

Then divide by denominator (2*m_pi)=2*139.6=279.2.

Thus p=8315.67 /279.2≈29.78 MeV/c. (Hence, confirming previous result.)

So then E_mu= sqrt( p^2 + m_mu² )=sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2 )≈sqrt(887+11172)≈sqrt(12059)≈109.8 MeV. Subtract m_mu gives KE≈4.1MeV. 

Another cross-check: the total energy given to the products is E_mu=109.8 and E_nu≈29.78. Adding them gives approximate 139.58 MeV which is very close to the original 139.6, allowing for rounding errors. So this is consistent.

Thus, the kinetic energy of the muon is about4.1 MeV. Perhaps approximate becomes 4.12 with more precise calculation.

But if we want to carry through more significant figures.

Given p= (139.6² –105.7² )/(2*139.6)= (19488.16 –11172.49)/279.2 =8315.67 /279.2

Computing 8315.67 /279.2. Let's do:

279.2×29.78=279.2*30 -279.2*0.22=8376 –61.424=8314.576.

So 29.78 gives 8314.576. Difference. 8315.67–8314.576=1.094. Remainder 1.094/279.2≈0.0039 So p=29.7839 MeV.

Then E_mu= sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 )=sqrt( 29.7839² +105.7² )

Calculate 29.7839

In this decay process, we need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles when a stationary positive pion (Pi+) decays into a positive muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The given rest masses are 139.6 MeV for the pion and 105.7 MeV for the muon. The neutrino's rest mass can be considered zero, which is a standard assumption in particle physics problems.

Since the pion is initially at rest, its total energy equals its rest mass energy of 139.6 MeV. According to conservation laws, this energy must be distributed between the muon and neutrino. Additionally, momentum conservation requires that the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, since the initial momentum is zero.

Using conservation of energy: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
Using momentum conservation: p_mu = p_nu

For a massless neutrino, E_nu = p_nu (using c=1 in natural units)
For the muon, E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2

Solving these equations:
139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p
where p represents p_mu

After algebraic manipulation and careful calculation:
p = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2)/(2*139.6) ≈ 29.78 MeV

Using this momentum value:
E_mu = sqrt(29.78^2 + 105.7^2) ≈ 109.8 MeV

Therefore, the kinetic energy of the muon is:
KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV

The relatively small kinetic energy of the muon makes sense because most of the remaining energy (after accounting for the muon's rest mass) goes to the massless neutrino, which carries away approximately 29.8 MeV as kinetic energy.

With more precise calculations, the muon's kinetic energy comes to approximately 4.12 MeV, but 4.1 MeV is a reasonable approximation given the level of precision in the input values.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the kinetic energy of the resulting particles when a positive pion (\( \pi^+ \)) at rest decays into a positive muon (\( \mu^+ \)) and a neutrino (\( \nu \)). The given rest masses are: a pion with 139.6 MeV and a muon with 105.7 MeV. The rest mass of the neutrino can be considered negligible, given that neutrinos possess exceedingly small masses and are often treated as massless in many physics problems at this level, including this one.

Initially, since the pion is at rest, its total energy equals its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. Upon decay into a muon and a neutrino, total energy conservation and momentum conservation must hold. Initially, the pion's momentum is zero, meaning the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

For energy conservation: the total energy of the muon plus the energy of the neutrino equals the pion's rest energy:
\[ E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} \]

For momentum conservation, the magnitudes of the muon's momentum (\( p_{\mu} \)) and the neutrino's momentum (\( p_{\nu} \)) must be the same, but in opposite directions:
\[ p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} \]

Since the neutrino is effectively massless, its energy equals its momentum (\( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}c \)). In units where \(c=1\), \(E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} = p_{\mu}\).

For the muon, use the relativistic energy-momentum relation: \[ E_{\mu}^2 = p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2 \]

Substitute \( E_{\nu} \) from the momentum conservation into the energy equation:
\[ 139.6 = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + (105.7)^2} + p_{\mu} \]

Let \( p_{\mu} = p \) to simplify:
\[ 139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p \]
\[ \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p \]

Squaring both sides:
\[ p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2 \]
\[ p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \times 139.6 \times p + p^2 \]

Eliminate \( p^2 \) and solve:
\[ 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \times 139.6 \times p \]
\[ 2 \times 139.6 \times p = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2 \]
\[ p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \times 139.6} \]

Calculate:
- \( 139.6^2 \approx 19488.16 \)
- \( 105.7^2 \approx 11172.49 \)
- Difference: \( 8315.67 \)

\[ p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \text{ MeV} \]

Using \( p \approx 29.78 \) MeV, compute the energy of the muon:
\[ E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \]

Calculating gives:
\[ E_{\mu} \approx \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} \approx \sqrt{12059.3384} \approx 109.8 \text{ MeV} \]

The kinetic energy \( KE \) of the muon is:
\[ KE = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \text{ MeV} \]

Thus, the kinetic energy of the muon is approximately 4.1 MeV, with the neutrino carrying away the remaining energy, matching the results of the momentum-energy conservation principles.

Difference is 12059.575 –12056.04=3.535.\n\nSo sqrt(12059)= approx109.8 + 3.535/(2*109.8)=109.8 +0.016≈109.816.\n\nThus E_mu≈109.816 MeV.\n\nTherefore, KE=109.816 –105.7=4.116 MeV. So 4.116 MeV.\n\nGiven that if the pion is at rest, then the muon\'s kinetic energy is approximately 4.116 MeV, which if we round would be about 4.12 MeV. We can round it to 4.1 MeV.\n\nBut perhaps problem expects the answer in proper significant figures. The given masses are to one decimal place, the pion as 139.6 and the muon 105.7, so with 4 sig figs, although 139.6 MeV has 4sig figs. Let me see. Usually, uncertain in numbers? Assuming that, so here, result is about4.1 maybe, but in the calculation, we get 4.116. So if we put two decimal places becomes 4.12.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn’t specify. Let me check, perhaps we need exact expression instead.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider using exact expressions. So KE of muon would be :\n\nKE_mu=E_mu - m_mu= sqrt( p^2 +m_mu^2 ) -m_mu\n\nBut from previous, since m_pi= sqrt( p^2 +m_mu^2 ) +p\n\n=> sqrt( p^2 +m_mu^2 )=m_pi -p\n\nSo KE_mu= m_pi -p - m_mu= (m_pi -m_mu ) - p\n\nBut from p=(m_pi^2 -m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi )\n\nTherefore,\n\nKE_mu=(139.6 -105.7) - (139.6² -105.7² )/(2*139.6 )\n\nCalculate this: First term=33.9 MeV\n\nSecond term is= (139.6² -105.7²)/(2*139.6)= ( (139.6-105.7)(139.6+105.7) )/(2*139.6 ) \n\nWhich is= (33.9 * 245.3 )/(2*139.6 )\n\nAs above, which gave us numerator=8315.67, divided by denominator=279.2, so 29.78 MeV.\n\nThus KE=33.9 -29.78=4.12MeV.\n\nSo exact expression is:\n\n(m_pi –m_mu ) - (m_pi² –m_mu² )/(2 m_pi )\n\nBut (m_pi² –m_mu² )= (m_pi -m_mu )(m_pi +m_mu )\n\nSo KE= (m_pi –m_mu ) - ( (m_pi -m_mu )(m_pi +m_mu ) )/(2 m_pi )\n\nFactor out (m_pi -m_mu ):\n\nKE= (m_pi -m_mu )(1 - (m_pi +m_mu )/(2 m_pi ))= (m_pi -m_mu )( (2 m_pi -m_pi -m_mu )/(2 m_pi ))= (m_pi -m_mu )( (m_pi -m_mu )/(2 m_pi )).\n\nThus,\n\nKE= (m_pi -m_mu )² /(2 m_pi )\n\nSo formula is KE= [ (m_pi – m_mu )^2 ] / (2 m_pi )\n\nThat\'s a much better way! So we can use that formula directly.\n\nSo, insert values:\n\n(m_pi -m_mu )=139.6 –105.7=33.9MeV\n\nTherefore KE= (33.9)^2/( 2*139.6 )\n\nCompute 33.9^2=1149.21; divide by (2*139.6)=279.2. So KE=1149.21 /279.2≈4.116 MeV, same result.\n\nHence KE≈~4.12MeV.\n\nSo thus this is solution.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says "Find KE of product particles". Wait: but there are two product particles: mu+ and neutrino. The question is ambiguous here: asking for KE of "product particles" -- does it mean the KE of each, or the total? Usually in such decay problems the question usually asks for the KE of the massive particle, assuming that the neutrino\'s KE is its total energy (if massless). But to check.\n\nIf the question wants the KE of both products, then for the neutrino since it\'s (considered) massless, its KE is equal to its energy (total energy)=p_nu*c. Given c=1. So neutrino\'s KE is p_nu=29.78 MeV, and muon\'s KE is ≈4.12 MeV, totaling approximately 33.9 MeV  (difference of m_pi -m_mu). But usually I think in such cases, the Kinetic energy specifically asks for the massive particle\'s KE, e.g., the muon here.\n\nBut let\'s check original problem statement.\n\n"Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."\n\nPresumably, specifically asks for Kinetic energy of each product particle, perhaps. Since "product particles" (plural) in the decay. But neutrino\'s could be zero if treated as massless? Wait, neutrino\'s KE is its own energy. If neutrino is massless, then kinetic energy is same as total energy, which is p_nu*c=29.78 MeV.\n\nBut wait, Kinetic energy is defined as Total Energy minus rest mass energy. For neutrino and other massless particles, that kinetic energy is Total energy. But if rest mass is considered zero, then KE = E.\n\nBut in some contexts, people differentiate between relativistic KE and Newtonian, but regardless, for massless particles like photon or (approximate) neutrino, KE=Total Energy. For muon, which is massive, KE= E - m_mu.\n\nBut the problem says "Find KE of product particles". So  We\'d need to calculate both.\n\nWait, the user hasn\'t specified whether to compute KE for both products. So to make sure.\n\nThe products are mu+ and neutrino mu?\n\nWait, Notation is Pi+ → mu+ + V (nu). The mu+ is the antimuon? Wait, in pion decay, the pion decay products are a mu+ and a muon antineutrino, actually: Pi+ →mu+ + ν_mu, I think. But maybe in this problem details have a neutrino. Given proper processes. But regardless, user didn\'t specify, but, regardless, in terms of calculations, only mu+ has a rest mass; neutrino is consideredmassless.\n\nSo KE for the mu+ is 4.12 MeV and KE for neutrino is 29.78 MeV. But since questions often they just want the KE Of massive particle.\n\nHowever, the problem states “KE of product particles”, with the note that Pi+ is stationary.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the answer expects giving both.\n\nLet\'s recheck assumptions:\n\nIf I assume both, but usually ("product particles") -- but incorrect. Being on safe side, given problem gives the rest masses of pion and muon. So neutrino\'s rest mass is neglected, then its KE or Energy would be their portion. So total energy distributed:\n\nPi+ at rest: total energy is 139.6MeV= m_pi.\n\nEmu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )=109.8 MeV\n\nKe mu: 109.8-105.7=4.1MeV.\n\nE_nu= p ≈29.8 MeV.\n\nBut since in problem\'s specified particls are mu+ and neutrino. Given problems of this nature, often in exams or textbooks, When a stationary pion decays, if asked for kinetic energy of products, usually referred to the kinetic energy of the massive particle.\n\nMoreover, in the original pion decay, there are two product particles and often test questions request just. the kinetic energy of the charged particle (muon), as neutrino can be difficult to measure, so KE would refer to the muon. However, in some sources might need to check.\n\nBut since the problem statement is user written, but phrased as "KE of product particles", plural.\n\nI\'ll check particle data – pion decay.\n\nMain decay of Pi+ is to mu+ and muon neutrino. Inthe rest frame of the pion, as the problem states, the muon and neutrino go in opposite directions. Since they are back-to-back. The energies and momenta share.\n\nIn literature value, from my memory, the muon kinetic energy in pion decay at rest is about 4.1 MeV, which matches with our calculation. While the neutrino get around 30MeV.\n\nHence I think meant to ask for the KE of the muon specifically. \n\nTherefore, but had they meant the KE of product particles (sum, or mu and nu), maybe.\n\nBut general consensus would be the KE of the massive product particle (mu+ here) unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo here, after prolonged calculation, the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV. So final answer is about 4.1 MeV. But the exact Answer via the formula (m_pi – m_mu ) squared divided by (2 * m_pi )\n\nWhich is (33.9)^2/(2 *139.6 ) ≈4.1 MeV.\n\nTherefore box 4.1MeV. but wait verify using precise calculator:\n\n(m_pi=139.6, mass=105.7)\n\nThe muon\'s KE:\n\n(139.6 -105.7 )^2 / (2 *139.6 )\n\n33.9^2=1149.21\n\nDivide by 279.2: 1149.21/279.2≈4.116 MeV.\n\nSo it\'s about4.116 MeV. likely 4.12MeV or 4.1 MeV.”\n\nBut since the given data are in 1 decimal place (139.6 and105.7). So 139.6 has 4 sig figs, 105.7 has 4 as well. So possible answer to three signifcant figures.\n\n33.9 squared is 1149.21, 1149.21 divided by 279.2. Let\'s compute this exactly:\n\n1149.21 /279.2=4.116 approximately. So 4.12m3.giving 4.12 MeV but using dedication to decimal places:\n\nSince the original numbers are given to 1 decimal: 139.6 and105.7. So the difference is 33.9, squared is (33.9)^2= approx 1149.21. Weight divided by 279.2 (which is 139.6*2= also known precisely hence 4.12 MeV.\n\nWait, but perhaps since some of the decimal points may give it:\n\nThough I need to probably limit the significant figures. Let me check. The values are:\n\nm_pi=139.6 is four significant figures (1,3,9,6)\n\nm_mu=105.7 is four as well wpierces considered present.\n\nSo the result is (139.6–105.7)=33.9 (three sig figs value, even though it\'s 33.9 with three decimal? No: trailing zeros after decimal are sig, so 33.9 is three sig figs.\n\nThen (33.9)^2= approx 1149.21, but 33.9 is three sig figs, squaring gives product of 33.9*33.9= 1149.21 which still should be three sigi:1.15×10^3.\n\nDenominator 276.2 is 2*139.6, which is four sig figs.\n\nDividing 1.15e3 (\\approx, 1149.21) by 279.2 (four sig figs):\n\nApprox 4.116≈4.12 MeV.

Relatve uncertainty: 0.1 /33.9≈0.295%, squared is≈0.589%, so absolute uncertainty≈0.589% of1149.21≈6.78.

To find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay \(\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu\), where the \(\pi^+\) is stationary, we start by using conservation of energy and momentum.

1. **Conservation of Energy**:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   Here, \(E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} = 139.6 \text{ MeV}\) (since the pion is at rest), \(E_{\mu}\) is the total energy of the muon, and \(E_{\nu}\) is the energy of the neutrino.

2. **Conservation of Momentum**:
   Since the pion is initially at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}
   \]

3. **Relativistic Energy Relations**:
   - For the muon: \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\)
   - For the (massless) neutrino: \(E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}\)

4. **Substitute into Energy Conservation Equation**:
   \[
   139.6 = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + (105.7)^2} + p_{\mu}
   \]

5. **Solve for \(p_{\mu}\)**:
   Rearranging and squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:
   \[
   139.6 - p_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + 105.7^2}
   \]
   \[
   (139.6 - p_{\mu})^2 = p_{\mu}^2 + 105.7^2
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying:
   \[
   139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p_{\mu} + p_{\mu}^2 = p_{\mu}^2 + 105.7^2
   \]
   \[
   139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p_{\mu} = 105.7^2
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p_{\mu} = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2
   \]
   \[
   p_{\mu} = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
   \]
   Calculating the numerator and denominator:
   \[
   139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7) = 33.9 \times 245.3 = 8315.67
   \]
   \[
   p_{\mu} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \text{ MeV}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Muon's Total Energy**:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx \sqrt{887.08 + 11172.49} \approx \sqrt{12059.57} \approx 109.8 \text{ MeV}
   \]

7. **Kinetic Energy of the Muon**:
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \text{ MeV}
   \]

The kinetic energy of the muon is \(\boxed{4.1}\) MeV.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

²: (29 +0.7839 )²=29²+2*29*0.7839 +0.7839²= 841 +45.471 +0.614≈841+45.471=886.471 +0.614≈887.085

Thus, sqrt(887.085 +105.7² )

105.7²=11172.49

So 11172.49 +887.085≈12059.575

So sqrt(12059.575 )

At this point, since calculators are off, but 109.8^2=109.8*109.8= (110 -0.2)^2= 110² -2*110*0.2 +0.2²=12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04

Which is very close to 12059.575. Difference is 12059.575 –12056.04=3.535.

So sqrt(12059)= approx109.8 + 3.535/(2*109.8)=109.8 +0.016≈109.816.

Thus E_mu≈109.816 MeV.

Therefore, KE=109.816 –105.7=4.116 MeV. So 4.116 MeV.

Given that if the pion is at rest, then the muon's kinetic energy is approximately 4.116 MeV, which if we round would be about 4.12 MeV. We can round it to 4.1 MeV.

But perhaps problem expects the answer in proper significant figures. The given masses are to one decimal place, the pion as 139.6 and the muon 105.7, so with 4 sig figs, although 139.6 MeV has 4sig figs. Let me see. Usually, uncertain in numbers? Assuming that, so here, result is about4.1 maybe, but in the calculation, we get 4.116. So if we put two decimal places becomes 4.12.

But the problem statement doesn’t specify. Let me check, perhaps we need exact expression instead.

Alternatively, let's consider using exact expressions. So KE of muon would be :

KE_mu=E_mu - m_mu= sqrt( p^2 +m_mu^2 ) -m_mu

But from previous, since m_pi= sqrt( p^2 +m_mu^2 ) +p

=> sqrt( p^2 +m_mu^2 )=m_pi -p

So KE_mu= m_pi -p - m_mu= (m_pi -m_mu ) - p

But from p=(m_pi^2 -m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi )

Therefore,

KE_mu=(139.6 -105.7) - (139.6² -105.7² )/(2*139.6 )

Calculate this: First term=33.9 MeV

Second term is= (139.6² -105.7²)/(2*139.6)= ( (139.6-105.7)(139.6+105.7) )/(2*139.6 ) 

Which is= (33.9 * 245.3 )/(2*139.6 )

As above, which gave us numerator=8315.67, divided by denominator=279.2, so 29.78 MeV.

Thus KE=33.9 -29.78=4.12MeV.

So exact expression is:

(m_pi –m_mu ) - (m_pi² –m_mu² )/(2 m_pi )

But (m_pi² –m_mu² )= (m_pi -m_mu )(m_pi +m_mu )

So KE= (m_pi –m_mu ) - ( (m_pi -m_mu )(m_pi +m_mu ) )/(2 m_pi )

Factor out (m_pi -m_mu ):

KE= (m_pi -m_mu )(1 - (m_pi +m_mu )/(2 m_pi ))= (m_pi -m_mu )( (2 m_pi -m_pi -m_mu )/(2 m_pi ))= (m_pi -m_mu )( (m_pi -m_mu )/(2 m_pi )).

Thus,

KE= (m_pi -m_mu )² /(2 m_pi )

So formula is KE= [ (m_pi – m_mu )^2 ] / (2 m_pi )

That's a much better way! So we can use that formula directly.

So, insert values:

(m_pi -m_mu )=139.6 –105.7=33.9MeV

Therefore KE= (33.9)^2/( 2*139.6 )

Compute 33.9^2=1149.21; divide by (2*139.6)=279.2. So KE=1149.21 /279.2≈4.116 MeV, same result.

Hence KE≈~4.12MeV.

So thus this is solution.

Alternatively, since the problem says "Find KE of product particles". Wait: but there are two product particles: mu+ and neutrino. The question is ambiguous here: asking for KE of "product particles" -- does it mean the KE of each, or the total? Usually in such decay problems the question usually asks for the KE of the massive particle, assuming that the neutrino's KE is its total energy (if massless). But to check.

If the question wants the KE of both products, then for the neutrino since it's (considered) massless, its KE is equal to its energy (total energy)=p_nu*c. Given c=1. So neutrino's KE is p_nu=29.78 MeV, and muon's KE is ≈4.12 MeV, totaling approximately 33.9 MeV  (difference of m_pi -m_mu). But usually I think in such cases, the Kinetic energy specifically asks for the massive particle's KE, e.g., the muon here.

But let's check original problem statement.

"Find KE of product particles in,
Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu
here Pi(+) is stationary.
Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

Presumably, specifically asks for Kinetic energy of each product particle, perhaps. Since "product particles" (plural) in the decay. But neutrino's could be zero if treated as massless? Wait, neutrino's KE is its own energy. If neutrino is massless, then kinetic energy is same as total energy, which is p_nu*c=29.78 MeV.

But wait, Kinetic energy is defined as Total Energy minus rest mass energy. For neutrino and other massless particles, that kinetic energy is Total energy. But if rest mass is considered zero, then KE = E.

But in some contexts, people differentiate between relativistic KE and Newtonian, but regardless, for massless particles like photon or (approximate) neutrino, KE=Total Energy. For muon, which is massive, KE= E - m_mu.

But the problem says "Find KE of product particles". So  We'd need to calculate both.

Wait, the user hasn't specified whether to compute KE for both products. So to make sure.

The products are mu+ and neutrino mu?

Wait, Notation is Pi+ → mu+ + V (nu). The mu+ is the antimuon? Wait, in pion decay, the pion decay products are a mu+ and a muon antineutrino, actually: Pi+ →mu+ + ν_mu, I think. But maybe in this problem details have a neutrino. Given proper processes. But regardless, user didn't specify, but, regardless, in terms of calculations, only mu+ has a rest mass; neutrino is consideredmassless.

So KE for the mu+ is 4.12 MeV and KE for neutrino is 29.78 MeV. But since questions often they just want the KE Of massive particle.

However, the problem states “KE of product particles”, with the note that Pi+ is stationary.

Given this, perhaps the answer expects giving both.

Let's recheck assumptions:

If I assume both, but usually ("product particles") -- but incorrect. Being on safe side, given problem gives the rest masses of pion and muon. So neutrino's rest mass is neglected, then its KE or Energy would be their portion. So total energy distributed:

Pi+ at rest: total energy is 139.6MeV= m_pi.

Emu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )=109.8 MeV

Ke mu: 109.8-105.7=4.1MeV.

E_nu= p ≈29.8 MeV.

But since in problem's specified particls are mu+ and neutrino. Given problems of this nature, often in exams or textbooks, When a stationary pion decays, if asked for kinetic energy of products, usually referred to the kinetic energy of the massive particle.

Moreover, in the original pion decay, there are two product particles and often test questions request just. the kinetic energy of the charged particle (muon), as neutrino can be difficult to measure, so KE would refer to the muon. However, in some sources might need to check.

But since the problem statement is user written, but phrased as "KE of product particles", plural.

I'll check particle data – pion decay.

Main decay of Pi+ is to mu+ and muon neutrino. Inthe rest frame of the pion, as the problem states, the muon and neutrino go in opposite directions. Since they are back-to-back. The energies and momenta share.

In literature value, from my memory, the muon kinetic energy in pion decay at rest is about 4.1 MeV, which matches with our calculation. While the neutrino get around 30MeV.

Hence I think meant to ask for the KE of the muon specifically. 

Therefore, but had they meant the KE of product particles (sum, or mu and nu), maybe.

But general consensus would be the KE of the massive product particle (mu+ here) unless specified otherwise.

So here, after prolonged calculation, the KE of the muon is approximately 4.12 MeV. So final answer is about 4.1 MeV. But the exact Answer via the formula (m_pi – m_mu ) squared divided by (2 * m_pi )

Which is (33.9)^2/(2 *139.6 ) ≈4.1 MeV.

Therefore box 4.1MeV. but wait verify using precise calculator:

(m_pi=139.6, mass=105.7)

The muon's KE:

(139.6 -105.7 )^2 / (2 *139.6 )

33.9^2=1149.21

Divide by 279.2: 1149.21/279.2≈4.116 MeV.

So it's about4.116 MeV. likely 4.12MeV or 4.1 MeV.”

But since the given data are in 1 decimal place (139.6 and105.7). So 139.6 has 4 sig figs, 105.7 has 4 as well. So possible answer to three signifcant figures.

33.9 squared is 1149.21, 1149.21 divided by 279.2. Let's compute this exactly:

1149.21 /279.2=4.116 approximately. So 4.12m3.giving 4.12 MeV but using dedication to decimal places:

Since the original numbers are given to 1 decimal: 139.6 and105.7. So the difference is 33.9, squared is (33.9)^2= approx 1149.21. Weight divided by 279.2 (which is 139.6*2= also known precisely hence 4.12 MeV.

Wait, but perhaps since some of the decimal points may give it:

Though I need to probably limit the significant figures. Let me check. The values are:

m_pi=139.6 is four significant figures (1,3,9,6)

m_mu=105.7 is four as well wpierces considered present.

So the result is (139.6–105.7)=33.9 (three sig figs value, even though it's 33.9 with three decimal? No: trailing zeros after decimal are sig, so 33.9 is three sig figs.

Then (33.9)^2= approx 1149.21, but 33.9 is three sig figs, squaring gives product of 33.9*33.9= 1149.21 which still should be three sigi:1.15×10^3.

Denominator 276.2 is 2*139.6, which is four sig figs.

Dividing 1.15e3 (\approx, 1149.21) by 279.2 (four sig figs):

Approx 4.116≈4.12 MeV. Given possible operations with three sig figs in numerator and four in denominator, the answer should be 4.12 MeV ( three sig figs)

But initial values:

Perhaps need to trace the sig figs through each step.

Original masses: 139.6 (4 ), 105.7 (4)
calculating (139.6 –105.7)=33.9 (uncertainty is the last digit’s place which? For 139.6: ±0.1, and 105.7: ±0.1, then uncertainty in difference: sqrt (0.1^2 + 0.1^2)=0.14, so 33.9 ±0.1.

Then squared (33.9 ±0.1)^2= approx 33.9²=1149.21. Relatve uncertainty: 0.1 /33.9≈0.295%, squared is≈0.589%, so absolute uncertainty≈0.589% of1149.21≈6.78. So 1149.21±6.78, which is approximates to 1149±7.

Divided by denominator: 2*139.6=279.2±0.2 (since 139.6±0.1 , so 2*0.1=0.2 uncertainty)

So1149±7 ÷279.2±0.2: 1149±0.6% / 279.2 approximately. The uncertainty in the Volume.

Approx 4.116 ± estimated : how much?

Relative uncertainty of numerator is ~0.6% and denominator's approximately0.07%.

Total relative uncertainty≈0.67%, so absolute≈4.116*0.0067≈~0.0277MeV. So reported as 4.12±0.03 MeV.

But Given that the computations here at particle physics, precision typical is 3 significant figures. When So the KE is4.12 MeV.

But standard texts may quote 4.1 MeV (often) as approximate value.

But user may accept 4.1 MeV.

But perhaps According to exact calculation, 4.1MeV. Back to the manual calculation for Saturday of the operations.

But several data sources. For example, in reality the charged pion decays to a muon and a neutrino, and referenced this, the kinetic energy is about 4.1 MeV, so it’s a standard value. Hence I can be confident.

So likely the answer is \boxed{4.1} MeV. but wait in the initial prompt law given” 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.” So user gives four sig figs. But the difference and then division may just end up with two decimal, but aligning as written from calculations.

Wait additionally, problem says “Find KE of product particles …” in the specified reaction. But in decay process, Howmuch KE is disposed to each particle.

So to double check: If it's two product particles, monomer residue and neutrino.

Hence, should I note how much neutrino's KE is sovs the muon.

But the problem could also check.

But original specifications give pion at rest. Therefore, muon and neutrino must exact opposite momenta. And muon E=total esqrt(p²+ m²).

Alright, taking achievable manner, but in order.

If all this fulcauslt, given pone decay. Perhaps I have spent about two hours Thinking. So best to bring final conclusion.

**Final Answer**
The kinetic energy of the muon is \boxed{4.1} MeV.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the kinetic energy of the muon (μ⁺) in the decay of a stationary π⁺ meson, we utilize conservation of energy and momentum.

**Given:**
- Rest mass of π⁺ (m_π) = 139.6 MeV
- Rest mass of μ⁺ (m_μ) = 105.7 MeV
- Neutrino (ν) is massless (E_ν = p_νc, with c≡1 in natural units)

**Conservation Laws:**
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   \( E_{π} = E_μ + E_ν \)  
   Since π⁺ is stationary, \( E_{π} = m_πc² = 139.6 \text{ MeV} \).

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   \(| \vec{p}_μ | = | \vec{p}_ν | = p\)

**Solve for p:**  
For the muon: \( E_μ² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)² \).  
Combining with energy conservation:  
\( m_πc² = \sqrt{(pc)² + (m_μc²)²} + pc \).

Let’s solve for \( pc \):  
\( (m_πc² - pc)² = (pc)² + (m_μc²)² \)  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\( m_π²c⁴ - 2m_πc²pc + (pc)² = (pc)² + m_μ²c⁴ \)  
Cancel \( (pc)² \):  
\( m_π²c⁴ - 2m_πc²pc = m_μ²c⁴ \)  
Solve for \( pc \):  
\( pc = \frac{m_π² - m_μ²}{2m_π}c² \)

Plugging in values:  
\( pc = \frac{139.6² - 105.7²}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} ≈ \frac{8315.67}{279.2} ≈ 29.78 \text{ MeV} \)

**Muon’s Total Energy:**  
\( E_μ = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} ≈ 109.8 \text{ MeV} \)

**Kinetic Energy of Muon (K_μ):**  
\( K_μ = E_μ - m_μc² = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \text{ MeV} \)

**Final Answer:**  
The kinetic energy of the muon is **\boxed{4.1 \text{ MeV}}**.

However, traditional phrasing says "KE of product particles," probably asking for each. Since the problem mentions the KE of the product particles in the decay, which are the muon and the neutrino—the neutrino\'s KE is equal to its total energy while muon\'s KE is its total energy minus its rest mass.

The product particles are the muon and the neutrino. The rest mass of the neutrino is negligible, so all of the neutrino\'s energy is kinetic energy, but was the question expecting individual kinetic energies or just the muon\'s? Since it\'s written as "KE of product particles," plural. So would I need to compute both? But maybe given standard question conventions, since the neutrino\'s rest mass is close to zero in many textbooks, sometimes they might expect just giving the muon\'s KE.

Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."\n\nSo, if "product particles" are muon and neutrino. Then their kinetic energies. But since the neutrino\'s kinetic energy would be equal to its total energy here, which is 29.78 MeV. But to confirm if that\'s necessary. Let me recompute. Let\'s make sure the E_pi is rest energy, so all of it goes to the total energy of the two particles.\n\nWait, the pion at rest, so energy is 139.6 MeV, the muon and the neutrino energies must sum to that.\n\nAlternatively, remember that in pion rest frame, the muon and neutrino are emitted in opposite directions. The neutrino is massless (If we consider standard model, actual neutrinos have mass, but in problems like this, we can take massless assumption given the user says "rest mass ... nu." Presuming unless told otherwise, neutrino is massless. Hence, for the neutrino: E = pc, so on units with c=1, E_nu = p_nu. But by momentum conservation, the magnitude of muon\'s momentum is equal to neutrino\'s. Hence, so in energy equation, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p. So energy conservation: sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.\n\nThis seems to mirror the earlier setup, leading to the kinetic energy of the muon being (E_mu - m_mu) = 109.8 - 105.7 ~ 4.1 MeV. As found.\n\nBut neutrino\'s KE would be E_nu = p ~29.78 MeV, and since it\'s (massless) KE is all of it.\n\nTherefore, depending on interpretation, the KE of the product particles would be 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.\n\nBut the problem just asks for KE of product particles in "Pi+ = mu+ + nu". Since the prompt specified the rest mass of Pi+ and mu+ but not the neutrino\'s. If the problem maybe assumes that neutrino\'s mass is zero, which then the answer would be the KE of mu+ and the neutrino. But perhaps in particle physics, the standard answer when asked for KE of product particles in pion decay is perhaps the KE of the muon because the neutrino kinetic energy is equal to its energy but usually you report both. Does the problem even say to find total KE or each? It just says "Find KE of product particles". So maybe sum. But in that case, the sum of KE\'s: KE_mu + KE_nu = 4.1 + 29.78 ~33.88 MeV. Alternatively, maybe the answer is only the muon\'s KE. Let\'s check that in textbooks or previous problems.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the problem statement, because the neutrino is considered massless and under typical exam question conventions, when the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino share the energy. The total energy available is m_pic^2 = 139.6 MeV. So considering that, total energy in the products should be 139.6. The rest energy of muon:105.7 MeV. So the remaining energy goes to kinetic: 139.6 - 105.7 =33.9. But that would be total kinetic energy? Wait, total energy : E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu*c^2, and E_nu which is KE_nu (if massless). Therefore, the sum of the kinetic energies would be the E_mu + E_nu - m_mu. Because E_pi= E_mu + E_nu = m_pi*c^2. So total KE of products is (E_mu - m_mu) +E_nu = (E_mu +E_nu) - m_mu = m_pi - m_mu. Which would be 139.6 -105.7=33.9MeV. Therefore, total KE of all products: 33.9 MeV. But didn\'t we calculate how KE is partitioned. So the answer could be looking for 33.9 MeV total KE, but the way the problem says "Find KE of product particles," perhaps total. However, in the initial approach, we found 4.1 MeV for muon and 29.78 MeV for neutrino as their separate KE, summing to approximately 33.88, approaching 33.9 ~33.9. That aligns with Total being 33.9.\n\nBut perhaps more precise. Let\'s repeat calculation with exact values.\n\nCompute:\n\nFirstly, m_pi c^2 =139.6 MeV\n\nRest mass of muon, m_mu=105.7 MeV\n\nFirst, derive:\n\nSet up:\n\nE_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )\n\nE_nu = p\n\nTotal energy equation:\n\nsqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np^2 + 105.7^2 + 2 p sqrt(p^2 +105.7^2) + p^2 =139.6^2\n\nWait, original equation: sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = E_pi\n\nHowever, squaring would be: (sqrt(p^2 m_mu^2) + p)^2 = E_pi^2\n\nSo expanding:\n\n( sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)^2 + 2 p sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p^2 ) = E_pi^2\n\nWhich gives:\n\n(p^2 + m_mu^2) + 2 p sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p^2 = E_pi^2\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n2p^2 + m_mu^2 + 2 p sqrt(p^2 +m_mu^2) = E_pi^2\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe a better approach assuming neutrino is massless:\n\nUse the formula for decay. In the rest frame of pion, conservation ensures maximum KE for muon; for a two-body decay where one particle is massless, the kinetic energy of the massive particle is given?\n\nAlternatively, known formula? Possible if we define:\n\nEnergy available for kinetic: Q = m_pi - m_mu =139.6 -105.7=33.9 MeV. However, this is the total KE divided? As previously.\n\nBut in reality, the kinetic energy distribution isn\'t equally split. Due to the masses and relativistic effects.\n\nWhen a particle at rest decays into two particles, one of which is massless, the kinetic energy of the massive particle is (using relativistic):\n\nTotal energy:\n\nE_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )\n\nE_nu= p\n\nEnergy conservation:\n\nsqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p = m_pi\n\nLet me solve it algebraically.\n\nLet’s define quantities without units for simplicity.\n\nLet E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²)\n\nE_nu = p\n\nThus: sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p\n\nSquare both sides:\n\np² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p²\n\nCancel p² terms:\n\nm_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p\n\nSolve for p:\n\n2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu²\n\nThus:\n\np = (m_pi² - m_mu² )/(2 m_pi )\n\nThus:\n\nThen the E_mu = m_pi - p = [/m_pi - (m_pi² - m_mu² )/(2 m_pi ) ]\n\nCompute E_mu:\n\n= (2 m_pi² - m_pi² + m_mu² )/(2 m_pi )\n\n= (m_pi² + m_mu² )/(2 m_pi )\n\nThus, muon\'s Kinetic Energy is E_mu - m_mu= [ (m_pi² + m_mu² )/(2 m_pi ) ] - m_mu\n\nSo:\n\nKE_mu = (m_pi^2 + m_mu^2 - 2 m_pi m_mu )/(2 m_pi )\n\n= ( (m_pi - m_mu )^2 )/(2 m_pi )\n\nTherefore:\n\nKE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu )² / (2 m_pi )\n\nUse given masses:\n\nm_pi =139.6 MeV,\n\nm_mu=105.7 MeV.\n\nCalculate (139.6-105.7)=33.9\n\nSquare that: 33.9^2 = 1149.21\n\nDivide by 2*139.6=279.2.\n\nThus KE_mu=1149.21 /279.2≈4.117 MeV≈4.12 MeV.\n\nMore precise answer would be about 4.1 MeV.\n\nTherefore the key formula?\n\nAnd the neutrino KE is p= (m_pi^2 - m_mu² )/(2 m_pi )\n\nWait, calculation of p:\n\np = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/( 2 m_pi )\n\nKE_nu is equal to p because neutrino is massless. So:\n\nE_nu= p = (139.6² -105.7² )/(2*139.6 )\n\nCalculate numerator:\n\n139.6²=139.6*139.6= (100 +39.6)^2=100² + 2*100*39.6 +39.6²\n\n=10000 + 7920 + 1568.16\n\n=10000+7920=17920; 17920+1568.16=19488.16\n\n105.7²=(100+5.7)^2=10000+1140+32.49=10000+1140=11140 +32.49=11172.49\n\nSo numerator 19488.16−11172.49=8315.67 MeV²\n\nTherefore p= 8315.67/(2*139.6)=8315.67/279.2≈29.78 MeV\n\nThat\'s neutrino\'s KE, 29.78 MeV. Sum with muon\'s KE≈4.12 MeV ≈33.9= total KE matching the Q value, Q= m_pi -m_mu=33.9 MeV. Thus, the total kinetic energy is 33.9 MeV, but the particles have 4.12 and 29.78 each.\n\nBut depending on the question phrasing, if it asks for each, they need both. If just gives norm. Maybe only asking for the muon. But original problem statement says \'product particles.\n\nBut the problem mentions the KE of the product particles. Since there are two product particles, I suppose write both.\n\nBut let\'s check the process. In the problem statement they specify the rest mass of Pi and Mu, but don\'t give the neutrino rest mass, probably considering it zero. Then neutrino Kinetic energy is its total energy, as massless particles’ energy and KE are same. So total product particles’ kinetic energy: More cautious, however the decimal points.\n\nAlready m_pi = 139.6, rest mass.\n\nThen in reality, maaybe neutrino\'s KE is ≈29.8 MeV and muon\'s ≈4.1.\n\nSo totaling 33.9 MeV, consistent with each other\n\nIf needed, perhaps simply the problem expects us to compute KE_mu\'s asKE= (m_pi - m_mu )^2/(2 m_pi ), based on above.\n\nHence m_pi is 139.6 and m_mu= 105.7.\n\nThus,\n\n(m_pi - m_mu)=33.9,\n\nsquare is 33.9²=1149.21,\n\ndivided by 2*139.6=279.2,\n\n1149.21 /279.2 approx4.1MeV,\n\nAnd the numerics on neutrino is similar on reflux.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps decay KE total is Q= 139.6 -105.7=33.9 MeV.\n\nBut since the muon is getting most of its KE? Wait no, since m_mu is large, its KE would be small compared to neutrino? Because neutrino, being light, carries away significant KE. Hence which the calculation 4.1 for muon and 29.8 for neutrino in total KE.\n\nBut original mass energy of pion is all being converted to rest mass of muon plus their relative KE. And energy conservation:\n\nTotal energy: m_pi = E_mu + E_nu= [ sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) ] + p\n\nWhich resolved to KE_mu=4.1 MeV and E_nu= 29.8 MeV, much higher, since neutrino takes more momentum. So answer: the muon\'s KE is 4.1 MeV. Maybe perhaps the answer is just that as the significant fraction. So k_e muon=4.1 Mev\n\nStandard problem solution.\n\nIn previous textbook problems, for instance, when a pion at rest decays, the KE of the muon is (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi ), which with values, approximately 4.1 MeV.\n\nHence calculated earlier.\n\nSo I believe the user is actually supposed to calculate KE for the muon, which as done is 4.1 (OK, more precise approx. 4.12 MeV).\n\nThus, i think the answer is \\boxed{4.1 \\text{ MeV}}.\n\nBut I just want another thorough checking.\n\nWait, doing the calculation of KE_mu as by formula (m_pi -m_mu )²/(2 m_pi )\n\nSo let’s do that:\n\n(139.6 -105.7)^2 / (2*139.6 )\n\n139.6-105.7=33.9\n\n33.9 squared is 33.9*33.9:\n\n33^2=1089\n\n0.9^2=0.81\n\nAnd cross terms:2*33*0.9=59.4\n\nHence (33 +0.9)^2=33^2 + 0.81 +59.4=1089+0.81+59.4=1149.21\n\nDivided by 2*139.6=279.2:\n\n1149.21 /279.2: 279.2 x4=1116.8, with difference 1149.21-1116.8=32.41. So roughly 4 + 32.41/279.2. 32 /279≈0.115 approx 4.115 MEV. Thus 4.115 MeV≈4.12 MeV≈4.1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4.1 MeV.\n\nThe standard answer in textbooks is indeed approximately 4.1 MeV. So the kinetic energy of the muon in the decay of a stationary pion is about 4.1 MeV. The neutrino would carry away the remaining energy, which would be m_pi - m_mu - KE_mu=33.9-4.1=29.8 MeV. But if the problem asks for the KE of the products, is it requiring both?\n\nBut possibly, as in many similar physics problems, they only expect us to compute KE of muon since the neutrino\'s KE is its total energy. However, in the question directly says "Find KE of product particles"—plural. But usually, from problems of this wording, if the body is at rest, the decay produces two particles, and sometimes they can be looking for the sum of kinetic energies. But calculations from energy conservation, the sum of KE is equal to m_pi - m_mu=33.9 MeV. However, we saw through exact calculation, including relativistic effects, confirmed that KE_mu is 4.1 and neutrino\'s kinetic energy is 29.8, both summing to approximately 33.9, which would be Q value.\n\nBut let me just check that.\n\nWait, if the available energy for KE is (m_pi - m_mu ). But No, actually, the rest energy of the pion is converted to the total energy of muon and neutrino, which would be E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.\n\nSince muon\'s rest mass is 105.7, its KE is E_mu -105.7. Neutrino\'s KE is equal to E_nu (as it is massless.), so sum of KEs is (E_mu -105.7) + E_nu= (E_mu + E_nu ) -105.7= m_pi c² -105.7=139.6-105.7=33.9 MeV as the total KEs.\n\nHence Answer KE_total=33.9MeV.\n\nAlternatively, the product particles’ kinetic energy depends on the context. If the proton had been the one that\'s decaying, certainly asks for sum. But this case pi+ is decaying to mu+ and nu, so the total would be the sum. But earlier example by following individual steps, getting KE_mu=4.1, KEnu=29.8, KEtotal= approximate 33.9, so summed-up.\n\nBut in some peer grading, in case they mixed between asking KE_total and KE_mu only.\n\nActually, reviewing problem statement again: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."\n\nNote that the neutrino\'s rest mass is not given, and in particle physics, muon decays, the neutrino is considered negligible (because actually it\'s an antineutrino, but overall.) Hence they expect KE of both muon and neutrino. Or if assuming sum. But let’s look up examples.\n\nQuick References: Cited from textbook: In the decay π+ → μ+ + ν_μ, considered pion is at rest. Compute the KE of the muon. The rest mass of the pion is 139.570 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.658 MeV/c².\n\nThe calculation yields, using KE_mu=( (m_pi - m_mu )^2 )/(2 m_pi ) which equals approx (33.912)^2/(2*139.570) ≈ 1150.2 /279.14 ≈4.12 MeV. Thus, the muon’s KE is approximately 4.12 MeV. So the answer is boxed as per question.\n\nHence, in examples, many physics texts only calculate the KE of the muon. Because the neutrino\'s KE is simply the rest energy of pion minus (muon\'s rest + its KE ). Thus, explaining why traditionally answer is 4.1 and instruction doesn\'t mention the neutrino\'s KE. Therefore, perhaps even though product particles are plural, the likely desired answer is the KE of the muon given that neutrino’s KE is non-trivial but innately determined. But since rest mass of nu is considered 0, e.g., the energy of nul= E varies, but in pi decay\'s rest frame, in common shares."\n\nFinal analysis: by relativistic formulas, muon KE ≈4.1 MeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe kinetic energy of the muon is \\boxed{4.1 \\text{ MeV}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1741163570, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5214, prompt_tokens=930, total_tokens=6144, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay \(\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu\) where the pion is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \text{ MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \text{ MeV}\). The neutrino is considered massless.

1. **Energy Conservation**:
   The total energy of the pion at rest is its rest mass energy:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = 139.6 \text{ MeV}
   \]
   This energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:
   Since the pion is initially at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}
   \]
   For the neutrino (massless), its energy is equal to its momentum:
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}
   \]

3. **Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation for the Muon**:
   \[
   E_{\mu}^2 = p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2
   \]

4. **Substitute and Solve**:
   Using the energy conservation equation:
   \[
   139.6 = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + 105.7^2} + p_{\mu}
   \]
   Solving for \(p_{\mu}\) (let \(p = p_{\mu}\)):
   \[
   139.6 - p = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   (139.6 - p)^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying:
   \[
   139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2 = p^2 + 105.7^2
   \]
   \[
   139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p
   \]
   \[
   p = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
   \]
   Calculating the numerator:
   \[
   139.6^2 \approx 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 \approx 11172.49
   \]
   \[
   p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \cdot 139.6} \approx \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \text{ MeV}
   \]

5. **Calculate Muon Energy**:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} \approx 109.8 \text{ MeV}
   \]

6. **Kinetic Energy of the Muon**:
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \text{ MeV}
   \]

Thus, the kinetic energy of the muon is \boxed{4.1 \text{ MeV}}.

 Due to the neutrino’s negligible mass, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy (\(\approx 29.78\) MeV), but the question asks specifically for the kinetic energy of the product particles, which, since the neutrino’s kinetic energy equals its total energy, the total would be 4.1 MeV (muon) + 29.78 MeV (neutrino). However, traditional phrasing says "KE of product particles," probably asking for each. Since the problem mentions the KE of the product particles in the decay, which are the muon and the neutrino—the neutrino's KE is equal to its total energy while muon's KE is its total energy minus its rest mass. But the problem didn't specify. Wait, checking the question again.

Wait: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi+ -> mu+ + nu. Here Pi+ is stationary." The product particles are the muon and the neutrino. The rest mass of the neutrino is negligible, so all of the neutrino's energy is kinetic energy, but was the question expecting individual kinetic energies or just the muon's? Since it's written as "KE of product particles," plural. So would I need to compute both? But maybe given standard question conventions, since the neutrino's rest mass is close to zero in many textbooks, sometimes they might expect just giving the muon's KE. However, given the question says "product particles," perhaps both. Let's check.

Original problem: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

So, if "product particles" are muon and neutrino. Then their kinetic energies. But since the neutrino's kinetic energy would be equal to its total energy here, which is 29.78 MeV. But to confirm if that's necessary. Let me recompute. Let's make sure the E_pi is rest energy, so all of it goes to the total energy of the two particles.

Wait, the pion at rest, so energy is 139.6 MeV, the muon and the neutrino energies must sum to that.

Alternatively, remember that in pion rest frame, the muon and neutrino are emitted in opposite directions. The neutrino is massless (If we consider standard model, actual neutrinos have mass, but in problems like this, we can take massless assumption given the user says "rest mass ... nu." Presuming unless told otherwise, neutrino is massless. Hence, for the neutrino: E = pc, so on units with c=1, E_nu = p_nu. But by momentum conservation, the magnitude of muon's momentum is equal to neutrino's. Hence, so in energy equation, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p. So energy conservation: sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

This seems to mirror the earlier setup, leading to the kinetic energy of the muon being (E_mu - m_mu) = 109.8 - 105.7 ~ 4.1 MeV. As found.

But neutrino's KE would be E_nu = p ~29.78 MeV, and since it's (massless) KE is all of it.

Therefore, depending on interpretation, the KE of the product particles would be 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.78 MeV for the neutrino.

But the problem just asks for KE of product particles in "Pi+ = mu+ + nu". Since the prompt specified the rest mass of Pi+ and mu+ but not the neutrino's. If the problem maybe assumes that neutrino's mass is zero, which then the answer would be the KE of mu+ and the neutrino. But perhaps in particle physics, the standard answer when asked for KE of product particles in pion decay is perhaps the KE of the muon because the neutrino kinetic energy is equal to its energy but usually you report both. Does the problem even say to find total KE or each? It just says "Find KE of product particles". So maybe sum. But in that case, the sum of KE's: KE_mu + KE_nu = 4.1 + 29.78 ~33.88 MeV. Alternatively, maybe the answer is only the muon's KE. Let's check that in textbooks or previous problems.

Alternatively, perhaps for the problem statement, because the neutrino is considered massless and under typical exam question conventions, when the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino share the energy. The total energy available is m_pic^2 = 139.6 MeV. So considering that, total energy in the products should be 139.6. The rest energy of muon:105.7 MeV. So the remaining energy goes to kinetic: 139.6 - 105.7 =33.9. But that would be total kinetic energy? Wait, total energy : E_mu = KE_mu + m_mu*c^2, and E_nu which is KE_nu (if massless). Therefore, the sum of the kinetic energies would be the E_mu + E_nu - m_mu. Because E_pi= E_mu + E_nu = m_pi*c^2. So total KE of products is (E_mu - m_mu) +E_nu = (E_mu +E_nu) - m_mu = m_pi - m_mu. Which would be 139.6 -105.7=33.9MeV. Therefore, total KE of all products: 33.9 MeV. But didn't we calculate how KE is partitioned. So the answer could be looking for 33.9 MeV total KE, but the way the problem says "Find KE of product particles," perhaps total. However, in the initial approach, we found 4.1 MeV for muon and 29.78 MeV for neutrino as their separate KE, summing to approximately 33.88, approaching 33.9 ~33.9. That aligns with Total being 33.9.

But perhaps more precise. Let's repeat calculation with exact values.

Compute:

Firstly, m_pi c^2 =139.6 MeV

Rest mass of muon, m_mu=105.7 MeV

First, derive:

Set up:

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

E_nu = p

Total energy equation:

sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Square both sides:

p^2 + 105.7^2 + 2 p sqrt(p^2 +105.7^2) + p^2 =139.6^2

Wait, original equation: sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = E_pi

However, squaring would be: (sqrt(p^2 m_mu^2) + p)^2 = E_pi^2

So expanding:

( sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)^2 + 2 p sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p^2 ) = E_pi^2

Which gives:

(p^2 + m_mu^2) + 2 p sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p^2 = E_pi^2

Which becomes:

2p^2 + m_mu^2 + 2 p sqrt(p^2 +m_mu^2) = E_pi^2

This seems complex. Maybe a better approach assuming neutrino is massless:

Use the formula for decay. In the rest frame of pion, conservation ensures maximum KE for muon; for a two-body decay where one particle is massless, the kinetic energy of the massive particle is given?

Alternatively, known formula? Possible if we define:

Energy available for kinetic: Q = m_pi - m_mu =139.6 -105.7=33.9 MeV. However, this is the total KE divided? As previously.

But in reality, the kinetic energy distribution isn't equally split. Due to the masses and relativistic effects.

When a particle at rest decays into two particles, one of which is massless, the kinetic energy of the massive particle is (using relativistic):

Total energy:

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

E_nu= p

Energy conservation:

sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p = m_pi

Let me solve it algebraically.

Let’s define quantities without units for simplicity.

Let E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²)

E_nu = p

Thus: sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p

Square both sides:

p² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p²

Cancel p² terms:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p

Solve for p:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu²

Thus:

p = (m_pi² - m_mu² )/(2 m_pi )

Thus:

Then the E_mu = m_pi - p = [/m_pi - (m_pi² - m_mu² )/(2 m_pi ) ]

Compute E_mu:

= (2 m_pi² - m_pi² + m_mu² )/(2 m_pi )

= (m_pi² + m_mu² )/(2 m_pi )

Thus, muon's Kinetic Energy is E_mu - m_mu= [ (m_pi² + m_mu² )/(2 m_pi ) ] - m_mu

So:

KE_mu = (m_pi^2 + m_mu^2 - 2 m_pi m_mu )/(2 m_pi )

= ( (m_pi - m_mu )^2 )/(2 m_pi )

Therefore:

KE_mu = (m_pi - m_mu )² / (2 m_pi )

Use given masses:

m_pi =139.6 MeV,

m_mu=105.7 MeV.

Calculate (139.6-105.7)=33.9

Square that: 33.9^2 = 1149.21

Divide by 2*139.6=279.2.

Thus KE_mu=1149.21 /279.2≈4.117 MeV≈4.12 MeV.

More precise answer would be about 4.1 MeV.

Therefore the key formula?

And the neutrino KE is p= (m_pi^2 - m_mu² )/(2 m_pi )

Wait, calculation of p:

p = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/( 2 m_pi )

KE_nu is equal to p because neutrino is massless. So:

E_nu= p = (139.6² -105.7² )/(2*139.6 )

Calculate numerator:

139.6²=139.6*139.6= (100 +39.6)^2=100² + 2*100*39.6 +39.6²

=10000 + 7920 + 1568.16

=10000+7920=17920; 17920+1568.16=19488.16

105.7²=(100+5.7)^2=10000+1140+32.49=10000+1140=11140 +32.49=11172.49

So numerator 19488.16−11172.49=8315.67 MeV²

Therefore p= 8315.67/(2*139.6)=8315.67/279.2≈29.78 MeV

That's neutrino's KE, 29.78 MeV. Sum with muon's KE≈4.12 MeV ≈33.9= total KE matching the Q value, Q= m_pi -m_mu=33.9 MeV. Thus, the total kinetic energy is 33.9 MeV, but the particles have 4.12 and 29.78 each.

But depending on the question phrasing, if it asks for each, they need both. If just gives norm. Maybe only asking for the muon. But original problem statement says 'product particles.

But the problem mentions the KE of the product particles. Since there are two product particles, I suppose write both.

But let's check the process. In the problem statement they specify the rest mass of Pi and Mu, but don't give the neutrino rest mass, probably considering it zero. Then neutrino Kinetic energy is its total energy, as massless particles’ energy and KE are same. So total product particles’ kinetic energy: More cautious, however the decimal points.

Already m_pi = 139.6, rest mass.

Then in reality, maaybe neutrino's KE is ≈29.8 MeV and muon's ≈4.1.

So totaling 33.9 MeV, consistent with each other

If needed, perhaps simply the problem expects us to compute KE_mu's asKE= (m_pi - m_mu )^2/(2 m_pi ), based on above.

Hence m_pi is 139.6 and m_mu= 105.7.

Thus,

(m_pi - m_mu)=33.9,

square is 33.9²=1149.21,

divided by 2*139.6=279.2,

1149.21 /279.2 approx4.1MeV,

And the numerics on neutrino is similar on reflux.

Alternatively, perhaps decay KE total is Q= 139.6 -105.7=33.9 MeV.

But since the muon is getting most of its KE? Wait no, since m_mu is large, its KE would be small compared to neutrino? Because neutrino, being light, carries away significant KE. Hence which the calculation 4.1 for muon and 29.8 for neutrino in total KE.

But original mass energy of pion is all being converted to rest mass of muon plus their relative KE. And energy conservation:

Total energy: m_pi = E_mu + E_nu= [ sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) ] + p

Which resolved to KE_mu=4.1 MeV and E_nu= 29.8 MeV, much higher, since neutrino takes more momentum. So answer: the muon's KE is 4.1 MeV. Maybe perhaps the answer is just that as the significant fraction. So k_e muon=4.1 Mev

Standard problem solution.

In previous textbook problems, for instance, when a pion at rest decays, the KE of the muon is (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi ), which with values, approximately 4.1 MeV.

Hence calculated earlier.

So I believe the user is actually supposed to calculate KE for the muon, which as done is 4.1 (OK, more precise approx. 4.12 MeV).

Thus, i think the answer is \boxed{4.1 \text{ MeV}}.

But I just want another thorough checking.

Wait, doing the calculation of KE_mu as by formula (m_pi -m_mu )²/(2 m_pi )

So let’s do that:

(139.6 -105.7)^2 / (2*139.6 )

139.6-105.7=33.9

33.9 squared is 33.9*33.9:

33^2=1089

0.9^2=0.81

And cross terms:2*33*0.9=59.4

Hence (33 +0.9)^2=33^2 + 0.81 +59.4=1089+0.81+59.4=1149.21

Divided by 2*139.6=279.2:

1149.21 /279.2: 279.2 x4=1116.8, with difference 1149.21-1116.8=32.41. So roughly 4 + 32.41/279.2. 32 /279≈0.115 approx 4.115 MEV. Thus 4.115 MeV≈4.12 MeV≈4.1.

Therefore, the answer is 4.1 MeV.

The standard answer in textbooks is indeed approximately 4.1 MeV. So the kinetic energy of the muon in the decay of a stationary pion is about 4.1 MeV. The neutrino would carry away the remaining energy, which would be m_pi - m_mu - KE_mu=33.9-4.1=29.8 MeV. But if the problem asks for the KE of the products, is it requiring both?

But possibly, as in many similar physics problems, they only expect us to compute KE of muon since the neutrino's KE is its total energy. However, in the question directly says "Find KE of product particles"—plural. But usually, from problems of this wording, if the body is at rest, the decay produces two particles, and sometimes they can be looking for the sum of kinetic energies. But calculations from energy conservation, the sum of KE is equal to m_pi - m_mu=33.9 MeV. However, we saw through exact calculation, including relativistic effects, confirmed that KE_mu is 4.1 and neutrino's kinetic energy is 29.8, both summing to approximately 33.9, which would be Q value.

But let me just check that.

Wait, if the available energy for KE is (m_pi - m_mu ). But No, actually, the rest energy of the pion is converted to the total energy of muon and neutrino, which would be E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

Since muon's rest mass is 105.7, its KE is E_mu -105.7. Neutrino's KE is equal to E_nu (as it is massless.), so sum of KEs is (E_mu -105.7) + E_nu= (E_mu + E_nu ) -105.7= m_pi c² -105.7=139.6-105.7=33.9 MeV as the total KEs.

Hence Answer KE_total=33.9MeV.

Alternatively, the product particles’ kinetic energy depends on the context. If the proton had been the one that's decaying, certainly asks for sum. But this case pi+ is decaying to mu+ and nu, so the total would be the sum. But earlier example by following individual steps, getting KE_mu=4.1, KEnu=29.8, KEtotal= approximate 33.9, so summed-up.

But in some peer grading, in case they mixed between asking KE_total and KE_mu only.

Actually, reviewing problem statement again: "Find KE of product particles in, Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu here Pi(+) is stationary. Rest mass of Pi(+) & mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively."

Note that the neutrino's rest mass is not given, and in particle physics, muon decays, the neutrino is considered negligible (because actually it's an antineutrino, but overall.) Hence they expect KE of both muon and neutrino. Or if assuming sum. But let’s look up examples.

Quick References: Cited from textbook: In the decay π+ → μ+ + ν_μ, considered pion is at rest. Compute the KE of the muon. The rest mass of the pion is 139.570 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.658 MeV/c².

The calculation yields, using KE_mu=( (m_pi - m_mu )^2 )/(2 m_pi ) which equals approx (33.912)^2/(2*139.570) ≈ 1150.2 /279.14 ≈4.12 MeV. Thus, the muon’s KE is approximately 4.12 MeV. So the answer is boxed as per question.

Hence, in examples, many physics texts only calculate the KE of the muon. Because the neutrino's KE is simply the rest energy of pion minus (muon's rest + its KE ). Thus, explaining why traditionally answer is 4.1 and instruction doesn't mention the neutrino's KE. Therefore, perhaps even though product particles are plural, the likely desired answer is the KE of the muon given that neutrino’s KE is non-trivial but innately determined. But since rest mass of nu is considered 0, e.g., the energy of nul= E varies, but in pi decay's rest frame, in common shares."

Final analysis: by relativistic formulas, muon KE ≈4.1 MeV.

**Final Answer**
The kinetic energy of the muon is \boxed{4.1 \text{ MeV}}.
