To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex with a stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \) at ideal pH (25 °C):

1. **Reaction and Stability Constant**:
   \[
   \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \quad K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
   \]
   Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \) and initial concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.

2. **Assumptions**:
   - Since \( K_f \) is very large, the dissociation of Ca-EDTA is minimal.
   - Let \( x \) be the concentration of dissociated Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Thus, \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \).
   - Approximation: \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \) M as \( x \) is negligible compared to 0.02 M.

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \implies 5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}
   \]

4. **Significant Figures**:
   - Considering the given values (0.02 M and \( 5 \times 10^{10} \)), the result is rounded to two significant figures based on 0.02.

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is \(\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mentioned the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5x10^10. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The term "stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex" probably means that all the calcium is initially bound to EDTA, right? So the solution has Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M concentration. But we need to find the free calcium ion concentration, [Ca²⁺].

The stability constant K is given, which should be the formation constant for the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation constant (Kf) is typically very large for EDTA complexes, which makes sense here since 5x10^10 is a huge number. A large Kf indicates that the complex is very stable, meaning that the dissociation of the complex into Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ is minimal. 

Since we are told that the pH is ideal, maybe that means the EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y⁴⁻), which is necessary for complex formation. At lower pH, EDTA would be protonated and not able to form complexes as effectively, but if pH is ideal, which likely means around pH where EDTA is deprotonated, maybe like pH 10 or something, but since it's stated as ideal, we can probably ignore any protonation effects.

So the reaction is: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻, and Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]).

In this case, the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. Let's assume that some of it dissociates to give x M of Ca²⁺ and x M of EDTA⁴⁻. But because Kf is so large, 5x10^10, we can assume that the amount dissociated (x) is very small compared to 0.02 M. So, we can approximate that [Ca-EDTA²⁻] is approximately 0.02 M, and [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x.

Therefore, plugging into the Kf expression:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

So 5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = (2/5)x10^-12 = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13

So x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(10^-13) = 2*(10^-13)^(1/2) = 2*10^(-6.5). Hmm, but wait, 10^-13 is the same as 10^-12 * 10^-1, so sqrt of that is 10^-6 * 10^-0.5. 10^-0.5 is approximately 0.316. So 2 * 0.316 * 10^-6 = 6.32 *10^-7, but actually, sqrt(4x10^-13) is same as sqrt(4)xsqrt(10^-13) = 2 x (10^-13)^(0.5) = 2 x 10^-6.5. Let me confirm; 10^-6.5 equals 10^(-6 -0.5) = 10^-6 / sqrt(10) ≈ 10^-6 / 3.16 ≈ 3.16 x 10^-7. So 2 times that is 6.32 x 10^-7, so x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

But wait, that seems possibly incorrect in terms of significant figures since K was given as 5x10^10, which is one significant figure. But maybe the answer should have two, since 0.02 is two? Hmm, but perhaps let me check again.

So, more accurately:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2)/(5x10^10) = 0.4x10^-12=4x10^-13

then x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. So 10^-6.5 = 1/sqrt(10) x 10^-6 ≈ 0.316 x10^-6 ≈ 3.16x10^-7.

Multiply by 2 gives 6.32x10^-7 M.

But with significant figures: since 0.02 (two sig figs) and 5x10^10 (one sig fig), then probably we should have one significant figure. So 6x10^-7 M.

But maybe the problem expects an exact expression. Wait. Alternatively, use scientific notation in terms of 2x...

Wait, let's see:

Original x² = 4x10^-13, so x = 2x10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is 3.16x10^-7, similar to above.

Alternatively, express the answer as (2)/sqrt(5x10^10*0.02). Wait, no.

Alternatively: in exact terms, ???

Alternatively, could represent it as 2 x 10^(-6.5). But going back to math: We have x = sqrt(0.02 / Kf) so sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(0.02)/sqrt(5e10) = sqrt(2e-2)/sqrt(5e10).

sqrt(2e-2) is sqrt(2)*1e-1 ≈ 1.414e-1, sqrt(5e10) is sqrt(5)*1e5 ≈ 2.236e5.

Dividing those: (1.414e-1) / (2.236e5) ≈ 0.632e-6 ≈ 6.32e-7. So indeed.

But maybe express with one or two significant factors. Since K was 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), the answer would be 6e-7 M? But I suppose if 0.02 is given as two significant figures, maybe. But maybe in the problem's context, they want a square root expression? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my assumption. Let me verify again.

Wait, we start with 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA. When it dissociates, it produces Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. Let me define x as the concentration of Ca^2+. So [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x (if no other sources of EDTA), [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 because x is so small.

So substituting into Kf expression, Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA]), so 5e10 = 0.02/(x*x). So x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10). The same calculation.

Wait, another thought: But formally, the formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−])

At ideal pH, Y^4− is the predominant form; there's only the complex, Ca²+ and Y^4−. If the solution is prepared by dissolving Ca-EDTA in water, at ideal pH, then the initial concentration is 0.02 M CaY²−. When some dissociates:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. [Ca²+] = x. [Y^4−] = x.

So plugging into Kf shows that x is equal to sqrt(0.02/Kf). Which gives x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) gives 2e-6.5.

Expressed in proper scientific notation, 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.3e-7 M. So yeah, about 6.3e-7 M for Ca²+.

But the problem states that the K is given as 5e10, and 0.02 M is concentration. Putting into the formula, with my calculation, 6.3e-7. Let me check numerically:

If x is 6.3e-7,

then x^2 = (6.3e-7)^2 ≈ 4e-13. Then 0.02 / (4e-13) = 5e10. Which matches the given K. So this checks out.

So, the free calcium ion concentration is approximately 6.3 x10^-7 M.

But let's check if my initial assumption is valid. I assumed that 0.02 - x is approximately 0.02, but x is 6e-7, which is way smaller than 0.02, since 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 vs 6e-7. The ratio is 6e-7 / 2e-2 = 3e-5, which is 0.003%, so negligible. Therefore, the assumption holds.

Alternatively, if we do not make the approximation, we need to solve:

Kf = (0.02 - x)/(x^2). So 5e10 = (0.02 - x)/x^2.

Multiply both sides by x^2:

5e10 x² = 0.02 - x

That's a quadratic equation:

5e10 x² + x -0.02 = 0.

But considering that Kf is very large, the quadratic term will dominate, so x will still be approximately sqrt(0.02/5e10). Even if I solved the quadratic:

Using quadratic formula: x = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*5e10*0.02)]/(2*5e10)

Square root term in the numerator: sqrt(1 + 4e9) = sqrt(1 + 4000000000) ≈ sqrt(4000000001) ≈ 63245.553

So x ≈ [-1 +63245.553]/ (1e11) which is 63244.553 /1e11 ≈ 6.3244553e-7 M, which is about 6.3245e-7, aligning with my previous value.

Thus, even the quadratic solution gives the same result as the approximation. Therefore, confirms that assuming x <<0.02 is okay, and the x^2 term in the equation is negligible over the 0.02.

Therefore, the calcium ion concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So its square root of (0.02 / Kf).

So in scientific notation, converting 6.3e-7 is equivalent to 6.3 x10^-7 M.

But calculated precisely we had:

x = sqrt(0.02 /5e10) = sqrt(0.02/5)/sqrt(1e10) = sqrt(0.004) /1e5= 0.063245553 /1e5=6.32456e-7.

So exactly at 6.32456 x10^-7 M.

But since the given data has 0.02 M (two sig figs) and Kf 5x10^10 (one sig fig), then the answer should have one significant figure, right? So 6x10^-7 M. But sometimes might keep two. Let's check.

In terms of sig figs: since 0.02 has two, and Kf is one. When multiplying or dividing, the number of sig figs is determined by the least. So 0.02 /5e10 is 4e-13 (using two sig figs? 0.02 is two, 5e10 is one. So the division would give two sig figs over one: so one sig fig. Therefore 4e-13. Then square root would leave us with one sig fig: sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is 6e-7 as one sig fig. So the answer is 6x10^-7 M.

Alternatively, if somewhere in the problem two significant figures, e.g., Kf was given as more, but no. Problem states KCa-EDTA is 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, so answer is one sig fig.

But the initial concentration is 0.02 M (maybe two; 0.02 can have two: the leading zeros don't count, and the two is two sig figs).

Hmm, actually 0.02 has two significant figures. But 5x10^10 has just one. So our calculation gives:

(0.02)/(5x10^10) = 0.02/(5) x10^-10 = 0.004 x10^-10=4x10^-13.

That 0.02 /5 is 0.004, which with 1 sig fig because 5 is 1 sig fig? Wait, when dividing, if you have two sig figs divided by one, you get one. Or more precisely:

0.02 which is two sig figs (2 and the last digit is uncertain in the second decimal place) divided by 5x10^10 which is one sig fig. As per rules, the result should have the least number of sig figs. So in this case, when you multiply/divide, the result has the same number of sig figs as the least precise term. So 0.02 (2 sig figs) divided by 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) would produce a number with 1 sig fig, which is indeed 4x10^-13 (4 is one sig fig). The square root of that, 6x10^-7, retains one sig fig.

Therefore, despite the intermediate steps, we have to present the answer with one significant figure: 6x10^-7 M.

However, sometimes, textbooks or instructors may be more lenient and allow two sig figs here, considering both the 0.02 and 5x10^10 (5.0x10^10 would be two sig figs, but 5x10^10 is one). So if the problem expects two sig figs, maybe 6.3x10^-7 M. But if strictly following sig figs, it's 6x10^-7. Since it's up to the person's interpretation. But given that, in real lab settings, we might use proper error propagation, but in an exam problem without specific instructions, likely accept up to two, maybe.

Wait. But hang on, 0.02 M has two, K is one, so the division 0.02 /5e10 is 0.02 /5 /1e10=0.004/1e10=4e-13, which is one sig fig (since 5 is one and 0.02 is two, but the least is one). Therefore, the final answer would have one: sqrt(4e-13)= ~6e-7. Even if exact calculation gives 6.32e-7, but one sig fig reads 6e-7.

But sometimes, when presenting chemical concentrations, excessive precision is avoided even if the sig figs would allow.

Given that, and since exact values would need explicit error terms, and from the problem statement, we have limited numbers, so I think safest answer given the info is 6x10^-7 M. But if it allows two, use two. Depending on establishment.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the answer in a certain way (square roots can sometimes allow keeping more digits), or maybe 6.3x10^-7 is acceptable, even if the trailing 0.3 is uncertain because of the limited sig figs.

But in many textbooks (in analytical chemistry, for example), when dealing with such calculations with K values given as 5e10 (which is a log K of about 10.7, but I don't know if that helps here). Wait, but log K = log (5x10^10) = log 5 + log10^10 ≈ 0.69897 +10 =10.69897. So given that, if that's a log K of ~10.7, the concentration of free Ca²+ would be sqrt( C / K ), where C is the concentration of the complex. Which is analogous to what we did here.

Either way, maybe the answer is 6x10^-7 M.

Alternatively, as an extra step, perhaps in molarity terms, that's 6.32456x10^-7, which is approximately 6.3x10^-7, but once again, here I go getting indecisive over significant figures.

Alternatively, perhaps I can just write the answer as \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}} but also confirming whether such answer makes sense. Since log K is approximately 10.7, so the concentration of free Ca²+ would be sqrt(c/K), so c=0.02M, so log (c/K) = log(0.02) - log(5e10) = (-1.69897) - (10.69897)= -12.397, then log([Ca²+])= (1/2)*(-12.397)= -6.1985, so [Ca²+] =10^-6.1985≈6.35x10^-7, which is 6.35e-7≈6.4e-7. Also that's with Log approximation, very close to our initial precise calculation term. So 6.3e-7 is pretty much spot on.

So given that, I can report 6.3 x10^-7, and perhaps in the absence of clear sig fig rules, they might accept keeping two decimal places. But considering that the problem mentioned "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex", implying all Ca²+ is initially bound, and pH is ideal, but likely precise calculation here gives approx. 6.3e-7 M. Hence, the answer is 6.3e-7 M, so \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mentioned the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is 5x10^10. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The term "stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex" probably means that all the calcium is initially bound to EDTA, right? So the solution has Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M concentration. But we need to find the free calcium ion concentration, [Ca²⁺].

The stability constant K is given, which should be the formation constant for the Ca-EDTA complex. The formation constant (Kf) is typically very large for EDTA complexes, which makes sense here since 5x10^10 is a huge number. A large Kf indicates that the complex is very stable, meaning that the dissociation of the complex into Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ is minimal. 

Since we are told that the pH is ideal, maybe that means the EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y⁴⁻), which is necessary for complex formation. At lower pH, EDTA would be protonated and not able to form complexes as effectively, but if pH is ideal, which likely means around pH where EDTA is deprotonated, maybe like pH 10 or something, but since it's stated as ideal, we can probably ignore any protonation effects.

So the reaction is: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻, and Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]).

In this case, the initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. Let's assume that some of it dissociates to give x M of Ca²⁺ and x M of EDTA⁴⁻. But because Kf is so large, 5x10^10, we can assume that the amount dissociated (x) is very small compared to 0.02 M. So, we can approximate that [Ca-EDTA²⁻] is approximately 0.02 M, and [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x.

Therefore, plugging into the Kf expression:

Kf = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

So 5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = (2/5)x10^-12 = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13

So x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(10^-13) = 2*(10^-13)^(1/2) = 2*10^(-6.5). Hmm, but wait, 10^-13 is the same as 10^-12 * 10^-1, so sqrt of that is 10^-6 * 10^-0.5. 10^-0.5 is approximately 0.316. So 2 * 0.316 * 10^-6 = 6.32 *10^-7, but actually, sqrt(4x10^-13) is same as sqrt(4)xsqrt(10^-13) = 2 x (10^-13)^(0.5) = 2 x 10^-6.5. Let me confirm; 10^-6.5 equals 10^(-6 -0.5) = 10^-6 / sqrt(10) ≈ 10^-6 / 3.16 ≈ 3.16 x 10^-7. So 2 times that is 6.32 x 10^-7, so x ≈ 6.32 x 10^-7 M. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

But wait, that seems possibly incorrect in terms of significant figures since K was given as 5x10^10, which is one significant figure. But maybe the answer should have two, since 0.02 is two? Hmm, but perhaps let me check again.

So, more accurately:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2)/(5x10^10) = 0.4x10^-12=4x10^-13

then x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. So 10^-6.5 = 1/sqrt(10) x 10^-6 ≈ 0.316 x10^-6 ≈ 3.16x10^-7.

Multiply by 2 gives 6.32x10^-7 M.

But with significant figures: since 0.02 (two sig figs) and 5x10^10 (one sig fig), then probably we should have one significant figure. So 6x10^-7 M.

But maybe the problem expects an exact expression. Wait. Alternatively, use scientific notation in terms of 2x...

Wait, let's see:

Original x² = 4x10^-13, so x = 2x10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is 3.16x10^-7, similar to above.

Alternatively, express the answer as (2)/sqrt(5x10^10*0.02). Wait, no.

Alternatively: in exact terms, ???

Alternatively, could represent it as 2 x 10^(-6.5). But going back to math: We have x = sqrt(0.02 / Kf) so sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(0.02)/sqrt(5e10) = sqrt(2e-2)/sqrt(5e10).

sqrt(2e-2) is sqrt(2)*1e-1 ≈ 1.414e-1, sqrt(5e10) is sqrt(5)*1e5 ≈ 2.236e5.

Dividing those: (1.414e-1) / (2.236e5) ≈ 0.632e-6 ≈ 6.32e-7. So indeed.

But maybe express with one or two significant factors. Since K was 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), the answer would be 6e-7 M? But I suppose if 0.02 is given as two significant figures, maybe. But maybe in the problem's context, they want a square root expression? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my assumption. Let me verify again.

Wait, we start with 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA. When it dissociates, it produces Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. Let me define x as the concentration of Ca^2+. So [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x (if no other sources of EDTA), [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 because x is so small.

So substituting into Kf expression, Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA]), so 5e10 = 0.02/(x*x). So x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10). The same calculation.

Wait, another thought: But formally, the formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−])

At ideal pH, Y^4− is the predominant form; there's only the complex, Ca²+ and Y^4−. If the solution is prepared by dissolving Ca-EDTA in water, at ideal pH, then the initial concentration is 0.02 M CaY²−. When some dissociates:

[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. [Ca²+] = x. [Y^4−] = x.

So plugging into Kf shows that x is equal to sqrt(0.02/Kf). Which gives x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) gives 2e-6.5.

Expressed in proper scientific notation, 2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.3e-7 M. So yeah, about 6.3e-7 M for Ca²+.

But the problem states that the K is given as 5e10, and 0.02 M is concentration. Putting into the formula, with my calculation, 6.3e-7. Let me check numerically:

If x is 6.3e-7,

then x^2 = (6.3e-7)^2 ≈ 4e-13. Then 0.02 / (4e-13) = 5e10. Which matches the given K. So this checks out.

So, the free calcium ion concentration is approximately 6.3 x10^-7 M.

But let's check if my initial assumption is valid. I assumed that 0.02 - x is approximately 0.02, but x is 6e-7, which is way smaller than 0.02, since 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 vs 6e-7. The ratio is 6e-7 / 2e-2 = 3e-5, which is 0.003%, so negligible. Therefore, the assumption holds.

Alternatively, if we do not make the approximation, we need to solve:

Kf = (0.02 - x)/(x^2). So 5e10 = (0.02 - x)/x^2.

Multiply both s

# Anthropic completion

Let me think through this calcium-EDTA equilibrium problem. We have a solution with 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex at ideal pH and 25°C, with a stability constant of 5x10^10. We need to determine the free calcium ion concentration.

Since EDTA is a chelating agent, it forms stable complexes with metal ions. At ideal pH conditions, EDTA exists in its fully deprotonated form (Y⁴⁻), which is optimal for complex formation. The high stability constant (5x10^10) indicates that the complex strongly favors formation over dissociation.

The equilibrium reaction is: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

Let's say the complex dissociates slightly to produce x M of Ca²⁺ and x M of EDTA⁴⁻. Because the stability constant is very large, we can assume that x is much smaller than 0.02 M. Therefore, [Ca-EDTA²⁻] remains essentially 0.02 M.

Using the stability constant expression: Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])
5x10^10 = 0.02/(x²)

Solving for x:
x² = 0.02/(5x10^10) = 4x10^-13
x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5 = 6.32x10^-7 M

To verify this result: The approximation we made (that x is negligible compared to 0.02) is valid because 6.32x10^-7 is much smaller than 0.02 (only 0.003% of 0.02). Additionally, plugging this value back into the original equation confirms our answer.

Considering significant figures, since the stability constant is given as 5x10^10 (one significant figure) and the initial concentration as 0.02 (two significant figures), the final answer should likely be expressed as 6x10^-7 M for the free calcium ion concentration.

Alright, here is the paraphrased text:

I have a dilemma; I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The conditions are perfect with an ideal pH, a temperature of 25°C, and a stability constant (KCa-EDTA) valued at 5x10^10. Let's see how to work this out.

I know that EDTA acts as a chelating agent, forming complexes with metal ions like calcium. The phrase "stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex" probably means that initially all calcium is complexed with EDTA. Hence, our solution has the Ca-EDTA complex at a concentration of 0.02 M. We aim to discover the free calcium ion concentration, denoted as [Ca²⁺].

The provided stability constant, K, is likely the formation constant for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is typically rather large, explaining the 5x10^10 magnitude. A substantial Kf indicates a highly stable complex, implying minimal dissociation into Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. 

Given the ideal pH, it implies that EDTA is probably in its fully deprotonated form (Y⁴⁻), crucial for complex formation. In lower pH scenarios, protonated EDTA wouldn't form complexes as efficiently, but if the pH is ideal, it likely hovers around where EDTA is deprotonated, maybe near pH 10, but since it's stated as ideal, we can dismiss protonation effects.

The reaction can be represented as follows: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻. For Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]).

With the initial 0.02 M of Ca-EDTA, if some dissociates to yield x M of both Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻, and given the large Kf value of 5x10^10, it is safe to assume that x is considerably smaller than 0.02 M. Thus, we approximate [Ca-EDTA²⁻] to remain around 0.02 M, with [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x.

Substituting these values into the Kf expression gives:

Kf = 0.02 / x²

Thus, 5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x², we get x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13.

Therefore, x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. Calculating further, 10^-6.5 can be broken down to 10^-6 / sqrt(10) ≈ 10^-6 / 3.16 ≈ 3.16 x 10^-7. Hence, multiplying by 2 gives approximately 6.32 x 10^-7, suggesting that [Ca²⁺] is roughly 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

With significant figures in mind, K was given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), and since 0.02 has two significant figures, the answer presumably should have two. Nonetheless, ensuring the calculations are accurate and adopting significant figures:

x² = 4x10^-13, leading to x = 2x10^-6.5, which translates to about 6.32x10^-7 M for [Ca²⁺].

Ultimately, considering both significant figures and the calculations, the free calcium ion concentration is approximately 6.3 x10^-7 M, verifying that the initial approximations and mathematics check out as correct.

Let's see:\n\nsqrt(0.02/(5e10)) = sqrt(0.02)/sqrt(5e10) = sqrt(0.02)/ (sqrt(5)*sqrt(1e10)) = sqrt(0.02)/ (sqrt(5)*1e5).\n\nsqrt(0.02) is sqrt(2*10^-2)=sqrt(2)*10^-1≈1.414*0.1≈0.1414\n\nsqrt(5)=≈2.236.

To find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the stability constant (formation constant) \( K_{f} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[ \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \]

Given that the pH is ideal, EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form (Y⁴⁻). The initial concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M, and we assume it dissociates minimally. Let \( x \) be the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \). The equilibrium concentration of \( \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \) is approximately 0.02 M, and the concentrations of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) are both \( x \).

The stability constant expression is:

\[ K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13} \]

\[ x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \]

Converting \( 10^{-6.5} \) to decimal form:

\[ 10^{-6.5} = 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.5} \approx 10^{-6} \times 0.316 = 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \]

Thus,

\[ x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \]

Rounding to two significant figures based on the given data, the concentration of calcium ions is:

\[ \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}} \]

ices: 5e10 x² + x - 0.02 = 0. But this is a quadratic equation: 5e10 x² + x -0.02 = 0. To solve for x.

However, because 5e10 is huge, the x term is negligible compared to the 5e10 x² term. So the quadratic equation can be approximated as 5e10 x² ≈ 0.02, so x ≈ sqrt(0.02 /5e10), which is what I did earlier. So yes, the approximation is valid.

So the exact solution would have x = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4 *5e10 *0.02)]/(2*5e10)

sqrt term: 1 + 4*5e10 *0.02 = 1 + 4 *1e9 = 1 +4,000,000,000≈4,000,000,001, hence sqrt(4,000,000,001)≈63,245.553. So x ≈ [ -1 + 63,245.553 ]/(1e11) ≈ (63,244.553)/1e11≈6.324e-7. So the approximate solution and exact solution here are nearly the same. Hence x ≈6.324e-7 M, which confirms the previous result.

Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

So given that, how should the answer be presented? The problem gives K as 5x10^10, which is one significant figure, and 0.02 M as two significant figures. Following significant figure rules, the answer should have one significant figure. So 6x10^-7 M. But maybe just express it as 6.3x10^-7 and note, but if strictly adhering, 6x10^-7.

Wait, I think in the calculation using exact implies x = sqrt(0.02 / (5x10^10)). The exact answer is sqrt(2/(5x10^12)) or sqrt(0.02/(5e10)). So x = (sqrt(0.02)/sqrt(5)) x10^-5. Because sqrt(5e10) is sqrt(5)e5. Let's see:

sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) = sqrt(0.02)/sqrt(5e10) = sqrt(0.02)/ (sqrt(5)*sqrt(1e10)) = sqrt(0.02)/ (sqrt(5)*1e5).

sqrt(0.02) is sqrt(2*10^-2)=sqrt(2)*10^-1≈1.414*0.1≈0.1414

sqrt(5)=≈2.236. So denominator 2.236 *1e5. Therefore x≈0.1414 / (2.236e5)≈0.0632e-5=6.32e-7.

Ah, so it's presented as 6.3x10^-7 considering the precision. So perhaps, with 2 sig figs (as 0.02 has two), but if K is one sig fig, how precise can we be? Maybe it's safer with one sig fig. So 6x10^-7 M. However, perhaps in chemical contexts, since the complex formation constant is an exponential term, even with one sig fig, they'll take more.

Alternatively, the answer is sqrt(0.02 / 5e10). But 0.02=2e-2 so inside becomes (2e-2)/(5e10)= (2/5)e-12=0.4e-12, so sqrt(0.4e-12)=sqrt(0.4)*sqrt(1e-12)=0.632*1e-6=6.32e-7. So a precise calculation gives about 6.32e-7, and with the given values, 5e10 and 0.02, which has 1 and 2 sig figs, so maybe 6.3e-7 is appropriate.

Alternatively, write it as 2/(sqrt(5e10 /0.02)).

But the problem maybe expects more concise answer.

Alternatively, recalling that Kf is Ca-EDTA formation constant. So lets show the final mathematical expression:

[Ca²+] = sqrt([Ca-EDTA]/Kf)

= sqrt(0.02/(5x10^10)).

Therefore [Ca²+] = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. Wait, 10^-6.5 ≈3.16x10^-7. So 2x3.16x10^-7≈6.3x10^-7.

Alternatively, if written ask:

2×10^(-13/2) =2×10^-6.5 which is 2×3.162×10^-7=6.324×10^-7, ≈6.32×10^-7. So given that, and given possible round-off in the problem statement, 6.3×10^-7 would be a reasonable answer.

Another way to think: Kf is given as 5×10^10. The square root of (0.02 / 5×10^10) is equal to sqrt( (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) )=sqrt( (2/5)x10^-12)=sqrt(0.4x10^-12)=sqrt(4x10^-13)=2x10^-6.5.

But perhaps the answer is 2x10^(-13/2). Wait, -13/2 is -6.5. So 2x10^-6.5, which is equal to 2/10^6.5. 10^6.5 is 10^6*10^0.5≈10^6*3.162≈3.162x10^6, so 2 / (3.162x10^6)≈6.32x10^-7. Yeah, same thing.

So maybe different forms, but decimal form would be 6.3x10^-7.

Alternatively, if written as 6.3x10^-7 M. So yeah.

Just to verify once more.

If [Ca²+] is 6.3x10^-7,

Then [EDTA^4-] is also 6.3x10^-7,

[Ca-EDTA]=0.02 -6.3e-7≈0.02.

Thus, Kf = 0.02/(6.3e-7)^2=0.02/(4e-13)=0.005e13=5e10. Yep.

Perfect match. So yes, that's the calculation. So I think that’s the result.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

To determine the concentration of free calcium ions (Ca²⁺) in a 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex solution at pH conditions ideal for EDTA (fully deprotonated, Y⁴⁻) and a stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), follow these steps:

### Key Steps:
1. **Equilibrium Reaction**:
   \[
   \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}
   \]

2. **Assume Dissociation** (Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ at concentration \(x\)):
   \[
   K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} = 5 \times 10^{10}
   \]
   Since the complex is dominant and K_f is large, \(x \ll 0.02\). Thus:
   \[
   5 \times 10^{10} \approx \frac{0.02}{x^2}
   \]

3. **Solve for** \(x\):
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13} \implies x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{M}
   \]

4. **Verification**:
   The assumption \(x \ll 0.02\) holds since \(6.32 \times 10^{-7} \approx 0.003\%\) of 0.02.

**Final Answer**:
The concentration of free calcium ions is **\(\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{M}}\)**.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions (\([Ca^{2+}]\)) in a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex solution, we use the stability constant (\(K_{f} = 5 \times 10^{10}\)) and assume ideal pH (EDTA is fully deprotonated as \(Y^{4-}\)).

### Step 1: Reaction and Stability Constant
The equilibrium reaction is:  
\[
Ca^{2+} + Y^{4-} \leftrightharpoons CaY^{2-}
\]  
The stability constant expression is:  
\[
K_{f} = \frac{[CaY^{2-}]}{[Ca^{2+}][Y^{4-}]}
\]

### Step 2: Let \(x = [Ca^{2+}] = [Y^{4-}]\)
Since all \(Ca^{2+}\) and \(Y^{4-}\) come from the dissociation of \(CaY^{2-}\):  
\[
[CaY^{2-}] \approx 0.02\ \text{M}, \quad [Ca^{2+}] = [Y^{4-}] = x
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(x\)
Substitute into the \(K_{f}\) equation:  
\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \implies x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]  
\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{M}}
\]

**Final Answer**  
The concentration of free calcium ions is \(\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{M}}\).
