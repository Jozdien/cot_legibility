In a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, Maxwell’s equations look different. But, specifically, which of those equations are different?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations become symmetrized to accommodate magnetic charge density (ρₘ) and magnetic current density (Jₘ). The affected equations are:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:  
   Original: **∇ · B = 0**  
   Modified: **∇ · B = μ₀ρₘ**  
   *Rationale*: Magnetic monopoles introduce a source term for the magnetic field, analogous to electric charge in Gauss's Law for electric fields.

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**:  
   Original: **∇ × E = -∂B/∂t**  
   Modified: **∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ**  
   *Rationale*: Magnetic currents (moving magnetic monopoles) induce electric fields, adding a term parallel to how electric currents affect Ampère's Law.

The other two equations—**Gauss's Law for electric fields (∇ · E = ρ/ε₀)** and **Ampère's Law (∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t)**—remain unchanged, as they already account for electric charges and currents. This symmetry ensures consistency with charge conservation for both electric and magnetic charges.

Okay, let's try to figure out which Maxwell equations would change if magnetic monopoles existed. Hmm, so in our universe, we don't have isolated magnetic charges, right? That means the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. That's Gauss's Law for magnetism, which is one of Maxwell's equations. 

But if in a parallel universe, you can have isolated North or South poles, that would mean there are magnetic charges. So, similar to how electric charges produce a divergence in the electric field E, magnetic charges would create a divergence in B. So Gauss's Law for magnetism, which in our world is ∇·B = 0, would instead have a magnetic charge density term, maybe something like ∇·B = μ₀ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. That makes sense.

Also, in Ampère's Law, which is ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t, I think there would be an additional term if there are magnetic currents. But wait, Ampère's Law in our universe doesn't have a magnetic current term because we don't have moving magnetic monopoles. If there are magnetic charges, then moving magnetic charges (magnetic currents) would contribute to the magnetic field's curl. But Ampère's Law is about electric currents and displacement current. Maybe Faraday's Law is affected instead? Wait, Faraday's Law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps this equation would get a term for the magnetic current density? I recall that when magnetic monopoles are introduced, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So both Gauss's laws would have their respective charge densities, and both Faraday's and Ampère's laws would have terms from the other type of current. 

Wait, in the standard Maxwell equations, Faraday's Law says that a time-varying magnetic field induces an electric field, and Ampère's Law relates the curl of B to the current and displacement current. If magnetic monopoles exist, symmetry suggests that just as electric charges produce electric fields (Gauss's Law), magnetic charges would produce magnetic fields (modified Gauss's Law). Also, just as moving electric charges (currents) produce magnetic fields (Ampère's Law), moving magnetic charges (magnetic currents) would produce electric fields. But how exactly does that fit into the equations?

I think when you add magnetic charges (monopoles) and magnetic currents, you need to adjust both Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law. So Faraday's Law, which in our universe is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, would get a term involving the magnetic current density J_m. Similarly, Ampère's Law would get a term for the magnetic displacement current, maybe? Let me check: if there's a magnetic current J_m, then according to the symmetry, the curl of E should be related to the time derivative of B plus the magnetic current. So perhaps ∇×E = -μ₀ J_m - ∂B/∂t. Wait, but isn't that for Faraday's Law? In our universe, the minus sign comes from Lenz's Law. With magnetic current, perhaps it would get an additional term.

But I need to be careful here. Let me recap the standard Maxwell equations:

1. Gauss's Law: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ε₀ ∂E/∂t

If magnetic monopoles exist, then equation 2 would change to ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. Also, to maintain symmetry, there needs to be a magnetic current term in Faraday's Law. So Faraday's Law, which relates the curl of E to the negative rate of change of B, should have an additional term involving the magnetic current J_m. Specifically, ∇×E = -μ₀ J_m - ∂B/∂t. 

Similarly, Ampère's Law might have another term if there's a displacement current from the magnetic field, but wait, no—because displacement current in Ampère's Law is due to the time derivative of E. The added term would be related to magnetic currents. Wait, but maybe Ampère's Law stays the same? No, the addition comes from Maxwell's correction to Ampère's Law introducing the displacement current. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps there's a dual to Ampère's Law for them. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine.

Alternatively, the presence of magnetic charge requires adding a term to Ampère's Law as well. But in our equations, Ampère's Law is about the curl of B being proportional to the current J plus displacement current. The symmetry would imply that the equation for the curl of E has a term proportional to the magnetic current. Let me think... If you have a magnetic current J_m (moving magnetic charges), then probably the curl of E would include that. But in standard equations, curl of E is due to time-varying B. So adding a term with J_m is analogous to how Ampère's Law has J and displacement current. Thus, if magnetic monopoles exist, then the equations would symmetrize, leading to:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

Wait, but in standard form, the Ampère's Law would have ∂E/∂t. In terms of Gaussian units or other units, it can vary, but in SI units, Ampère's Law is ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. So if we have symmetry, then adding a magnetic current would affect Faraday's Law, so that Faraday's Law includes the magnetic current, just how Ampère's Law includes the electric current. Also, the divergence equations would have their respective charge densities.

Alternatively, the units might be different, but the essence is that Gauss's Law for B would no longer have zero on the right, and Faraday's Law would gain a term with J_m, and maybe Ampère's Law would have an additional term if necessary. Wait, hold on. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the usual approach is to add two terms: a magnetic charge density in Gauss's Law for magnetism, and a magnetic current term in Faraday's Law. The Ampère's Law would remain as is? Or would there be a displacement for the magnetic field?

But maybe in this modified universe, they also have a magnetic displacement current? That seems less straightforward. Wait, Maxwell's correction was to add the displacement current ∂E/∂t to Ampère's Law to make it consistent with charge conservation. If there's a magnetic charge density, then would there be a need for a similar term in Faraday's Law for magnetic charge conservation?

Hold it: Charge conservation is expressed via the continuity equation: ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·J = 0. If magnetic charges exist, then magnetic charge conservation would require ∂ρ_m/∂t + ∇·J_m = 0. If that's the case, then perhaps adding the J_m term into Faraday's Law ensures consistency, just like how Maxwell added the displacement current in Ampère's Law to satisfy charge continuity.

Therefore, if the original Faraday's Law is ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t (no J_m term), then with magnetic charges, to make the equations consistent with magnetic charge conservation, we would need:

∇×E = - μ₀ J_m - ∂B/∂t

Similarly, Ampère's Law already has ∂E/∂t and J, but since in our universe, there is no magnetic current, so no additional term needed. But in that parallel universe, if there's a time derivative of the magnetic field, would they need a term there too? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law are complementary. The way we modified Ampère's Law with displacement current is to account for situations where the electric field changes over time, as needed for consistency with charge conservation when charge density changes. For magnetic fields, if there is a magnetic charge, then changes in the magnetic field would relate to currents and possibly displacement... Wait, maybe not displacement, but instead, when you have a magnetic current, that contributes to the curl of E. So in our universe, the curl of E is just due to a time-changing B. But with magnetic currents (moving monopoles), you also get a contribution to E's curl.

So then in the modified equations, you end up changing Gauss's Law for B from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, and you add the magnetic current term to Faraday's Law. Ampère's Law stays as it is because the magnetic monopole doesn't directly affect the sources of the magnetic field—except that in Ampère's Law, the J is the electric current, so unless we also have magnetic displacement current, which I don't think is necessary, Ampère's Law may remain the same.

Wait, but Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles normally have both Gauss's Law for B = μ₀ rho_m, and Faraday's Law with mu_0 J_m. Ampère's Law is left with the regular currents. So in that case, three equations changed? No, isn't it two equations: Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law? Because Ampère's is still associated with E currents.

Wait, actually, the modified Maxwell equations for magnetic monopoles (hypothetically) are as follows:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (changed)
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (changed)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e (unchanged? or is it adjusted?)

Wait, but maybe that's not entirely symmetric. If we have symmetry between electric and magnetic fields, perhaps Ampère's Law would have a term similar to how Faraday gained, but maybe no. Let's test this.

Original Faraday's Law (no monopoles):

∇×E = - ∂B/∂t

If you add monopoles with a current density J_m, then you modify it to ∇×E = - μ₀ J_m - ∂B/∂t.

Original Ampère's Law (no monopoles):

∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

If we are following symmetry, we might add a term for a displacement current in B? But B in that case is divergenceless (no), but here B is not divergenceless anymore, so maybe not necessary. Wait, but maintaining the symmetry would imply that there's a term in Ampère's Law corresponding to E's time derivative.

Hold on, let's see. If you consider electric charges and currents on one side, and magnetic charges and currents on the other, then in order for the equations to be symmetric, we need each curl equation to have the respective current term and displacement current.

Looking up in memory, from physics, when Dirac introduced magnetic monopoles, he modified Maxwell's equations as:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

This looks symmetric except for the negative sign and constants. So yes, only equations 2 and 3 are different.

But wait, in the standard Maxwell equations without monopoles, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0, equation 3 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (without the J_m term). So adding monopoles adds terms to equations 2 and 3. So which equations are different? Equations (2) Gauss's Law for magnetism and equation (3) Faraday's Law.

But when I think about Ampère's Law (equation 4), perhaps you need to make room for a hypothetical magnetic displacement current. Wait, but in reality, Ampère's Law involves the electric current and the displacement of the electric field. The magnetic displacement, if it exists, would be elsewhere.

Wait, to reconcile charge conservation, when you take the divergence of Ampère's Law:

∇·(∇×B) = 0 = μ₀ ∇·J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂/∂t (∇·E)

Since ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀, plugging this in: 0 = μ₀ ∇·J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂/∂t (ρ_e / ε₀ ) = μ₀ (∇·J_e + ∂ρ_e / ∂t )

Which gives the continuity equation for electric charge.

Similarly, if we have a term in Faraday's Law with J_m, taking the divergence of ∇×E:

∇·(∇×E) = 0 = -∇·(μ₀ J_m) - ∂/∂t (∇·B )

But ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, so:

0 = -μ₀ ∇·J_m - ∂/∂t (μ₀ ρ_m )

Divide by μ₀:

0 = -∇·J_m - ∂ρ_m / ∂t

So this gives the continuity equation for magnetic charge. Therefore, adding the J_m term in Faraday's Law is needed to ensure magnetic charge conservation. Therefore, the modifications are necessary, but Ampère's Law (equation 4) remains same as in original Maxwell equations. So in a universe with isolated magnetic poles, equations 2 and 3 would be different. Therefore, Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are different. So when the problem asks "which of those equations are different" — Gauss's Law for magnetism (∇·B = 0 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m) and Faraday's Law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m).

Therefore, the answer should be Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are modified. So from Maxwell's four equations, the two that change are Gauss's law for B (equation 2) and Faraday's law (equation 3).

Okay, let's try to figure out which Maxwell equations would change if magnetic monopoles existed. Hmm, so in our universe, we don't have isolated magnetic charges, right? That means the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. That's Gauss's Law for magnetism, which is one of Maxwell's equations.

# Anthropic completion

Let's explore how Maxwell's equations would be modified in a universe with magnetic monopoles. In our universe, there are no isolated magnetic charges, which is reflected in Gauss's Law for magnetism stating that the divergence of the magnetic field B equals zero.

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, where isolated North or South poles can exist, magnetic charges would be present. Similar to how electric charges create a divergence in the electric field E, these magnetic charges would generate a divergence in B. Therefore, Gauss's Law for magnetism would transform from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = μ₀ρ_m, where ρ_m represents the magnetic charge density.

The existence of magnetic monopoles would also affect other Maxwell equations due to the presence of magnetic currents. In our universe, Ampère's Law (∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t) describes how electric currents and displacement current contribute to the magnetic field's curl. However, the introduction of magnetic charges would primarily impact Faraday's Law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t).

When magnetic monopoles are introduced, Maxwell's equations become more symmetric. Both Gauss's laws would contain their respective charge densities, and both Faraday's and Ampère's laws would include terms from both types of current. Just as electric charges produce electric fields (Gauss's Law), magnetic charges would produce magnetic fields (modified Gauss's Law). Similarly, while moving electric charges (currents) produce magnetic fields (Ampère's Law), moving magnetic charges (magnetic currents) would produce electric fields.

To maintain this symmetry, Faraday's Law would need an additional term involving the magnetic current density J_m, becoming ∇×E = -μ₀J_m - ∂B/∂t. This modification parallels how Ampère's Law includes both electric current and displacement current terms.

Summarizing the modified Maxwell equations in a universe with magnetic monopoles:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e/ε₀ (Gauss's Law)
2. ∇·B = μ₀ρ_m (Modified Gauss's Law for magnetism)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀J_m (Modified Faraday's Law)
4. ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t (Ampère's Law)

The key changes are the addition of the magnetic charge density term in Gauss's Law for magnetism and the magnetic current term in Faraday's Law, creating a more symmetric set of equations that account for both electric and magnetic phenomena equally.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let’s explore which aspects of Maxwell's equations might be altered if magnetic monopoles existed. Presently, our universe doesn't contain isolated magnetic charges, which implies that the divergence of the magnetic field \( B \) is zero due to the absence of magnetic monopoles. This characteristic is encapsulated in Gauss's Law for magnetism, a component of Maxwell's equations.

If, however, in an alternate universe, isolated North or South poles could exist, then magnetic charges would indeed be present. This scenario would mirror how electric charges create a divergence in the electric field \( E \); here, magnetic charges would introduce a divergence in \( B \). Therefore, Gauss's Law for magnetism, which we currently express as \( \nabla \cdot B = 0 \), would need a term representing magnetic charge density, possibly expressed as \( \nabla \cdot B = \mu_0 \rho_m \), with \( \rho_m \) being the magnetic charge density.

Moreover, Ampère's Law, described by \( \nabla \times B = \mu_0 J + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \), might incorporate an additional term should magnetic currents exist. In our universe, this law lacks a magnetic current term since moving magnetic monopoles are absent. If magnetic charges existed, their motion, constituting magnetic currents, would influence the curl of the magnetic field. While Ampère's Law addresses electric currents and the displacement current, perhaps Faraday's Law would also be affected. Currently, Faraday's Law is given by \( \nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}\). With magnetic currents, this equation might include a magnetic current density term. When magnetic monopoles are considered, Maxwell's equations achieve a certain symmetry: each Gauss's Law includes its respective charge densities, and Faraday's and Ampère's Laws reflect influence from both types of current.

In the standard Maxwell equations, Faraday's Law implies that a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, while Ampère’s Law connects the curl of \( B \) with electric current and displacement current. Introducing magnetic monopoles might suggest that akin to how electric charges generate electric fields (Gauss's Law), magnetic charges would generate magnetic fields (a revised Gauss’s Law). Similarly, moving electric charges (electric currents) generating magnetic fields (Ampère’s Law) implies moving magnetic charges (magnetic currents) would create electric fields. Now, how does this integrate with the equations?

I surmise that introducing magnetic charges (monopoles) and currents necessitates adjusting both Faraday's and Ampère's Laws. The equation \( \nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} \) would gain a magnetic current density term \( J_m \). Analogously, Ampère’s Law might accommodate a magnetic displacement current term. Supposing a magnetic current \( J_m \) exists, symmetry dictates that the curl of \( E \) should relate to \( \frac{\partial B}{\partial t} \) and the magnetic current. So, potentially, \( \nabla \times E = -\mu_0 J_m - \frac{\partial B}{\partial t}\). While this aligns with Faraday's Law, the negative sign is explained by Lenz’s Law, with magnetic currents possibly introducing another term.

Consider the standard Maxwell equations:

1. Gauss’s Law: \( \nabla \cdot E = \frac{\rho_e}{\varepsilon_0} \)
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: \( \nabla \cdot B = 0 \)
3. Faraday's Law: \( \nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} \)
4. Ampère's Law: \( \nabla \times B = \mu_0 J + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \)

If magnetic monopoles existed, equation 2 would transform into \( \nabla \cdot B = \mu_0 \rho_m \). To conserve symmetry, Faraday's Law must incorporate a magnetic current term, amending \( \nabla \times E = -\mu_0 J_m - \frac{\partial B}{\partial t} \).

Similarly, Ampère’s Law might encounter modification if a displacement current emerges from the magnetic field, though typically this displacement current relates to \( \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \). The addition could stem from magnetic currents, but Ampère’s Law itself is altered by Maxwell’s introduction of the displacement current. Introducing magnetic currents could imply creating a dual to Ampère's Law for them. Upon reflection, the presence of magnetic charge necessitates adapting Ampère’s Law too. However, generally, Ampère’s Law manneredly equates the curl of \( B \) with the electric current and displacement current. Symmetry might argue for the equation for the curl of \( E \) to encompass a factor correlated to the magnetic current, hypothesizing \( J_m \) might highlight the curl of \( E \), complementing the conventional equation where the curl is due to time-varying \( B \). Thus, if magnetic monopoles were present, symmetry would predict these equations:

1. \( \nabla \cdot E = \frac{\rho_e}{\varepsilon_0} \)
2. \( \nabla \cdot B = \mu_0 \rho_m \)
3. \( \nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} - \mu_0 J_m \)
4. \( \nabla \times B = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \mu_0 J_e \)

In standard terms, Ampère’s Law incorporates \( \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \). Differing unit scales, like Gaussian or others, might vary the terms, however, in SI units, Ampère's Law retains \( \nabla \times B = \mu_0 J + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \). Symmetry suggests Faraday’s Law should include a magnetic current term. Therefore, Faraday's Law embraces magnetic currents equivalently to Ampère's integration of electric currents. Moreover, the divergence equations would reflect their charge densities.

Alternatively, units might differ, yet essentially, Gauss's Law for \( B \) would not persist with zero on the right aside, and Faraday's Law would accumulate a term involving \( J_m \). If magnetic monopoles appear, traditional practice amends Gauss's Law for magnetism with a magnetic charge density term and includes a magnetic current term within Faraday's Law. Ampère’s Law might extant unchanged, barring deviations. However, in this adjusted world, magnetic displacement currents might too manifest, a notion that seems elaborate. Remember, Maxwell's displacement current correction in Ampère's Law incorporates \( \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \).

If there are magnetic charges, then there would be a continuity equation for magnetic charge as well: ∇·J_m + ∂ρ_m / ∂t = 0. Then, similar to how the electric displacement current is added to Ampère's Law to account for the charge conservation, perhaps the magnetic displacement current would be added to Faraday's Law. But I might be mixing things up.\n\nSo, if magnetic charge is conserved, then we'd have: ∂ρ_m/∂t + ∇·J_m = 0, analogous to electric charge. So Faraday's Law, as per Maxwell's approach, would have a term in ∂E/∂t if we're assuming symmetry. But how does it fit?\n\nWait, let's step back. The standard Maxwell equations are:\n\n1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀\n2. ∇·B = 0\n3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t\n4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t\n\nHere, the sources are electric charge and current. For full symmetry with magnetic monopoles, we would introduce ρ_m as magnetic charge and J_m as magnetic current. Then equations become:\n\n1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀\n2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m\n3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m\n4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t\n\nWait, but in this case, the constants may need to be adjusted. For example, if we take a symmetry approach, with electric and magnetic charges, then Gaussian units might have symmetry, but in SI units, we need to choose appropriate constants. Let me check. In SI units, when people talk about including magnetic monopoles, the modified equations are:\n\n1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀\n2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m\n3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m\n4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t\n\nBut the units of J_m are charge per area per time? Hmm, not exactly sure. Alternatively, in some formulations, to maintain symmetry, you can use different constants. It's possible that there is a factor depending on the units. But I think in the standard treatment when including magnetic monopoles, the two equations that change are Gauss's Law for magnetism (so ∇·B now equals the magnetic charge density) and Faraday's Law, which gains a term for the magnetic current. Then, the other two equations (Gauss's Law for E and Ampère's Law) remain with electric sources. So the answer is that Gauss's Law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3) become different, each gaining a term related to magnetic charge or current.\n\nAlternatively, but would the Ampère's Law also receive a modification? If there's symmetry, perhaps both curl equations (Faraday's and Ampère's) get terms. Wait, in the standard equations with monopoles, both Ampère's and Faraday's laws can be modified if there's both electric and magnetic currents. Wait, let's check a textbook approach. \n\nFor instance, in the presence of magnetic charge density ρ_m and magnetic current density J_m, Maxwell's equations (in SI units) would typically be written as:\n\n1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀\n2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m\n3. ∇×E = - J_m / ε₀ - ∂B/∂t\n4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t\n\nWait, but that might depend on the choice of units and how the magnetic charge is defined. For example, the unit of J_m would then be webers per second or something. However, without getting bogged down in unit conventions, the key idea is that if magnetic monopoles exist, two equations change: Gauss's Law for B (non-zero divergence) and Faraday's Law gets a term for the magnetic current. Then Ampère's Law and Gauss's Law for E remain with their electric counterparts. \n\nIs that the case? Let me think again. \n\nIn the absence of magnetic monopoles, magnetic field lines are continuous (∇·B=0). With monopoles, the divergence of B is non-zero. Then, for Ampère's Law: Ours has ∇×B related to J_e plus displacement current. If there is a magnetic current J_m, then to maintain symmetry, should Faraday's Law relate ∇×E to the time derivative of B and J_m? Because in Ampère's Law, ∇×B is determined by J_e plus the displacement of E. Similarly, if you have a current J_m (magnetic), then Faraday's Law would get a term from J_m. So ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t (from changing B) plus something with J_m. But J_m is a current, so maybe μ₀ J_m? But to make the units match in SI, maybe need a proportionality constant. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if you follow the duality transformation, then electric and magnetic quantities are exchanged with a certain symmetry, leading to the presence of both charge densities and both current terms in their respective curl equations. So each of the curl equations (Faraday and Ampère) would have terms from both current types. For example, ∇×E would have -∂B/∂t (as usual) and a term proportional to J_m. Similarly, ∇×B would have the usual μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t plus a term proportional to J_e, but wait, perhaps the duality just means you add the terms as required.\n\nWait, no. If you are introducing magnetic charge and current, you should only modify the equations that didn't have them. ∇·B = 0 becomes non-zero. Similarly, the Faraday's Law which previously had just -∂B/∂t would now also include the magnetic current. Ampère's Law, as in the equation for ∇×B, already includes electric current and displacement current, and in symmetry, there isn't a need to add another term unless we are considering the displacement current for B. But displacement current term for B is in Faraday's Law with the -∂B/∂t. Wait, I might be getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, here's a systematic approach. Maxwell's equations without monopoles are:\n\n1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀\n2. ∇·B = 0\n3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t \n4. ∇×B = μ₀ (J_e + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )\n\nWith monopoles, the magnetic charge density ρ_m appears, so equation 2 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m. Then, the presence of magnetic current J_m would require modifying equation 3, to have a term dependent on J_m, in analogy to equation 4. But why? Because continuity equation for magnetic charges would require that ∇·J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t =0, similar to electric charges. \n\nIn Maxwell's original equations, Ampère's Law before displacement current didn't satisfy charge conservation. Adding the displacement current makes it compatible with charge conservation (the continuity equation). Similarly, if we have magnetic charge, to have Faraday's Law compatible with the continuity equation for magnetic charge, we need to add a term. For example, if Faraday's Law was only ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t, then taking the divergence of both sides would give ∇·(∇×E) = - ∂ (∇·B)/ ∂t. But the left side is zero (div of curl is zero). Therefore, - ∂ (∇·B)/ ∂t = - ∂ (μ₀ ρ_m)/ ∂t. Which would be equal to - μ₀ ∂ρ_m/∂t. But according to continuity equation for magnetic charges: ∂ρ_m/∂t + ∇·J_m = 0. Therefore, - μ₀ ∂ρ_m/∂t = μ₀ ∇·J_m. Therefore, unless Faraday's Law includes a term involving ∇·J_m, the equation would not be consistent. Hence, just like in Ampère's Law where the displacement current was added to satisfy charge continuity, perhaps Faraday's Law must include a term. But how?\n\nWait, taking the curl of E, the left side of equation 3 would need to account for the current. Wait, but maybe we need a term that when taking divergence gives ∇·J_m. However, the equation for ∇×E already would involve the time derivative of B. \n\nWait, Faraday's Law in standard form (equation 3) is ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t. The divergence of this is zero on the left, so ∂(∇·B)/∂t = 0. But if ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, then ∂(∇·B)/∂t = μ₀ ∂ρ_m/∂t. But from continuity equation, μ₀ ∂ρ_m/∂t = - μ₀ ∇·J_m. Putting it together, 0 = -μ₀ ∇·J_m. But that equals ∇·(μ₀ J_m) = 0. Therefore, unless ∇·J_m =0, it's inconsistent. So this suggests that the standard Faraday's Law can't account for magnetic currents. To resolve this, similar to how Maxwell added the displacement current to Ampère's Law, we need to add a term to Faraday's Law so that its divergence matches the magnetic continuity equation. Therefore, if we revise Faraday's Law to ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m. Then taking the divergence: left side is 0, right side is - ∂(∇·B)/∂t - μ₀ ∇·J_m. Substituting ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, we get - μ₀ ∂ρ_m/∂t - μ₀ ∇·J_m = - μ₀ (∂ρ_m/∂t + ∇·J_m ) = 0, which satisfies the continuity equation. Therefore, adding the term - μ₀ J_m to Faraday's Law makes it consistent with magnetic charge conservation. Therefore, the two modified equations are Gauss's Law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3). \n\nSo in this scenario, Maxwell's equations become:\n\n1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)\n2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (formerly zero)\n3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (previously only - ∂B/∂t)\n4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (unchanged, only electric current and displacement current)\n\nTherefore, equations 2 and 3 are different. Is Ampère's Law also affected? From the above, it seems no, because the presence of magnetic monopoles don't directly influence Ampère's Law—only the existence of magnetic current would affect Faraday's Law. Ampère's Law deals with electric current and the electric displacement current. So unless there's a displacement of magnetic fields (maybe analogous to displacement current but for B), but it doesn't get a magnetic current term. Ampère's Law remains the same. Therefore, the equations which would differ in the presence of isolated magnetic poles are Gauss's Law for magnetism (∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m instead of 0) and Faraday's Law (with an added term for magnetic current - μ₀ J_m). \n\nBut wait, in some references, when magnetic monopoles are introduced, both Ampère's and Faraday's get additional terms. Let me recall. For example, in some theoretical treatments, when including magnetic charges and currents, the equations are written with symmetry between E and B. So introducing a magnetic current adds a term to both the Ampère's Law and Faraday's Law. Wait, maybe in that case, the electric charge would affect Gauss and Ampère, and the magnetic charge would affect Gauss for B and Faraday. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from how we define the equations and units.\n\nAlternatively, let's look up the standard form of Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles. (Even though I don't have the ability to access external materials, I can recall.)\n\nIn Dirac's formulation, introducing magnetic monopoles leads to symmetric Maxwell equations:\n\n1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀\n\n2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m\n\n3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m\n\n4. ∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e\n\nSo equations 2 and 3 are modified (if originally 3 was without J_m). But in the original Maxwell equations without monopoles, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t and ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. Therefore, in the presence of monopoles, equation 2 (Gauss for B) and equation 3 (Faraday) are modified. Equation 4 (Ampère) remains with J_e. So is that correct? Wait, no, equation 4 already has J_e. So, no, Ampère's Law, equation 4, isn't modified further when magnetic monopoles are introduced. So only equation 2 and 3. Hence, the answer would be that Gauss’s Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law are different. \n\nBut let's just confirm. Suppose magnetic monopoles exist. Then, we have magnetic charge density ρ_m. So, according to Gauss’s Law, which was originally ∇·B = 0, that must now be ∇·B = something—right. And for Faraday’s Law, to account for magnetic current J_m. Then if so, Maxwell's equations would require two equations to change: Gauss's law for magnetism to include magnetic charge, and Faraday's law to include magnetic current. Then equations 2 and 3.

In a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations are modified to account for magnetic charge density (\(\rho_m\)) and magnetic current density (\(\mathbf{J}_m\)). The key changes occur in Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law of Induction. Here is the detailed reasoning:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: In our universe, the absence of magnetic monopoles means \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0\). With magnetic monopoles, this equation includes a term for magnetic charge density, resulting in:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m
   \]

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: In our universe, Faraday's Law is \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\). With magnetic currents, an additional term (\(\mathbf{J}_m\)) is introduced to account for the effect of moving magnetic charges, leading to:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m
   \]

The other two Maxwell equations (Gauss's Law for electric fields and Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition) remain unchanged because they are already formulated to account for electric charges and currents.

### Final Answer
The modified equations are Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, these become:

\[
\boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}
\]

 make it consistent with charge conservation. If there are magnetic charges, then there would be a continuity equation for magnetic charge as well: ∇·J_m + ∂ρ_m / ∂t = 0. Then, similar to how the electric displacement current is added to Ampère's Law to account for the charge conservation, perhaps the magnetic displacement current would be added to Faraday's Law. But I might be mixing things up.

So, if magnetic charge is conserved, then we'd have: ∂ρ_m/∂t + ∇·J_m = 0, analogous to electric charge. So Faraday's Law, as per Maxwell's approach, would have a term in ∂E/∂t if we're assuming symmetry. But how does it fit?

Wait, let's step back. The standard Maxwell equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Here, the sources are electric charge and current. For full symmetry with magnetic monopoles, we would introduce ρ_m as magnetic charge and J_m as magnetic current. Then equations become:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Wait, but in this case, the constants may need to be adjusted. For example, if we take a symmetry approach, with electric and magnetic charges, then Gaussian units might have symmetry, but in SI units, we need to choose appropriate constants. Let me check. In SI units, when people talk about including magnetic monopoles, the modified equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

But the units of J_m are charge per area per time? Hmm, not exactly sure. Alternatively, in some formulations, to maintain symmetry, you can use different constants. It's possible that there is a factor depending on the units.

Wait, in the standard equations with monopoles, both Ampère's and Faraday's laws can be modified if there's both electric and magnetic currents. Wait, let's check a textbook approach. 

For instance, in the presence of magnetic charge density ρ_m and magnetic current density J_m, Maxwell's equations (in SI units) would typically be written as:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m
3. ∇×E = - J_m / ε₀ - ∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Wait, but that might depend on the choice of units and how the magnetic charge is defined. For example, the unit of J_m would then be webers per second or something. However, without getting bogged down in unit conventions, the key idea is that if magnetic monopoles exist, two equations change: Gauss's Law for B (non-zero divergence) and Faraday's Law gets a term for the magnetic current. Then Ampère's Law and Gauss's Law for E remain with their electric counterparts. 

Is that the case? Let me think again. 

In the absence of magnetic monopoles, magnetic field lines are continuous (∇·B=0). With monopoles, the divergence of B is non-zero. Then, for Ampère's Law: Ours has ∇×B related to J_e plus displacement current. If there is a magnetic current J_m, then to maintain symmetry, should Faraday's Law relate ∇×E to the time derivative of B and J_m? Because in Ampère's Law, ∇×B is determined by J_e plus the displacement of E. Similarly, if you have a current J_m (magnetic), then Faraday's Law would get a term from J_m. So ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t (from changing B) plus something with J_m. But J_m is a current, so maybe μ₀ J_m? But to make the units match in SI, maybe need a proportionality constant. Hmm.

Alternatively, if you follow the duality transformation, then electric and magnetic quantities are exchanged with a certain symmetry, leading to the presence of both charge densities and both current terms in their respective curl equations. So each of the curl equations (Faraday and Ampère) would have terms from both current types. For example, ∇×E would have -∂B/∂t (as usual) and a term proportional to J_m. Similarly, ∇×B would have the usual μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t plus a term proportional to J_e, but wait, perhaps the duality just means you add the terms as required.

Wait, no. If you are introducing magnetic charge and current, you should only modify the equations that didn't have them. ∇·B = 0 becomes non-zero. Similarly, the Faraday's Law which previously had just -∂B/∂t would now also include the magnetic current. Ampère's Law, as in the equation for ∇×B, already includes electric current and displacement current, and in symmetry, there isn't a need to add another term unless we are considering the displacement current for B. But displacement current term for B is in Faraday's Law with the -∂B/∂t. Wait, I might be getting confused.

Alternatively, here's a systematic approach. Maxwell's equations without monopoles are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t 
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (J_e + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

With monopoles, the magnetic charge density ρ_m appears, so equation 2 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m. Then, the presence of magnetic current J_m would require modifying equation 3, to have a term dependent on J_m, in analogy to equation 4. But why? Because continuity equation for magnetic charges would require that ∇·J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t =0, similar to electric charges. 

In Maxwell's original equations, Ampère's Law before displacement current didn't satisfy charge conservation. Adding the displacement current makes it compatible with charge conservation (the continuity equation). Similarly, if we have magnetic charge, to have Faraday's Law compatible with the continuity equation for magnetic charge, we need to add a term. For example, if Faraday's Law was only ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t, then taking the divergence of both sides would give ∇·(∇×E) = - ∂ (∇·B)/ ∂t. But the left side is zero (div of curl is zero). Therefore, - ∂ (∇·B)/ ∂t = - ∂ (μ₀ ρ_m)/ ∂t. Which would be equal to - μ₀ ∂ρ_m/∂t. But according to continuity equation for magnetic charges: ∂ρ_m/∂t + ∇·J_m = 0. Therefore, - μ₀ ∂ρ_m/∂t = μ₀ ∇·J_m. Therefore, unless Faraday's Law includes a term involving ∇·J_m, the equation would not be consistent. Hence, just like in Ampère's Law where the displacement current was added to satisfy charge continuity, perhaps Faraday's Law must include a term. But how?

Wait, taking the curl of E, the left side of equation 3 would need to account for the current. Wait, but maybe we need a term that when taking divergence gives ∇·J_m. However, the equation for ∇×E already would involve the time derivative of B. 

Wait, Faraday's Law in standard form (equation 3) is ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t. The divergence of this is zero on the left, so ∂(∇·B)/∂t = 0. But if ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, then ∂(∇·B)/∂t = μ₀ ∂ρ_m/∂t. But from continuity equation, μ₀ ∂ρ_m/∂t = - μ₀ ∇·J_m. Putting it together, 0 = -μ₀ ∇·J_m. But that equals ∇·(μ₀ J_m) = 0. Therefore, unless ∇·J_m =0, it's inconsistent. So this suggests that the standard Faraday's Law can't account for magnetic currents. To resolve this, similar to how Maxwell added the displacement current to Ampère's Law, we need to add a term to Faraday's Law so that its divergence matches the magnetic continuity equation. Therefore, if we revise Faraday's Law to ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m. Then taking the divergence: left side is 0, right side is - ∂(∇·B)/∂t - μ₀ ∇·J_m. Substituting ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, we get - μ₀ ∂ρ_m/∂t - μ₀ ∇·J_m = - μ₀ (∂ρ_m/∂t + ∇·J_m ) = 0, which satisfies the continuity equation. Therefore, adding the term - μ₀ J_m to Faraday's Law makes it consistent with magnetic charge conservation. Therefore, the two modified equations are Gauss's Law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3). 

So in this scenario, Maxwell's equations become:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)
2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (formerly zero)
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m (previously only - ∂B/∂t)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t (unchanged, only electric current and displacement current)

Therefore, equations 2 and 3 are different. Is Ampère's Law also affected? From the above, it seems no, because the presence of magnetic monopoles don't directly influence Ampère's Law—only the existence of magnetic current would affect Faraday's Law. Ampère's Law deals with electric current and the electric displacement current. So unless there's a displacement of magnetic fields (maybe analogous to displacement current but for B), but it doesn't get a magnetic current term. Ampère's Law remains the same. Therefore, the equations which would differ in the presence of isolated magnetic poles are Gauss's Law for magnetism (∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m instead of 0) and Faraday's Law (with an added term for magnetic current - μ₀ J_m). 

But wait, in some references, when magnetic monopoles are introduced, both Ampère's and Faraday's get additional terms. Let me recall. For example, in some theoretical treatments, when including magnetic charges and currents, the equations are written with symmetry between E and B. So introducing a magnetic current adds a term to both the Ampère's Law and Faraday's Law. Wait, maybe in that case, the electric charge would affect Gauss and Ampère, and the magnetic charge would affect Gauss for B and Faraday. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from how we define the equations and units.

Alternatively, let's look up the standard form of Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles. (Even though I don't have the ability to access external materials, I can recall.)

In Dirac's formulation, introducing magnetic monopoles leads to symmetric Maxwell equations:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀

2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m

3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m

4. ∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e

So equations 2 and 3 are modified (if originally 3 was without J_m). But in the original Maxwell equations without monopoles, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t and ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. Therefore, in the presence of monopoles, equation 2 (Gauss for B) and equation 3 (Faraday) are modified. Equation 4 (Ampère) remains with J_e. So is that correct? Wait, no, equation 4 already has J_e. So, no, Ampère's Law, equation 4, isn't modified further when magnetic monopoles are introduced. So only equation 2 and 3. Hence, the answer would be that Gauss’s Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law are different. 

But let's just confirm. Suppose magnetic monopoles exist. Then, we have magnetic charge density ρ_m. So, according to Gauss’s Law, which was originally ∇·B = 0, that must now be ∇·B = something—right. And for Faraday’s Law, to account for magnetic current J_m. Then if so, Maxwell's equations would require two equations to change: Gauss's law for magnetism to include magnetic charge, and Faraday's law to include magnetic current. Then equations 2 and 3. That seems to be the case.

Therefore, the answer should be Gauss’s Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law of Induction are modified.

**Final Answer**
The modified equations are Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, these become:

\boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}

In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations would gain symmetry between electric and magnetic phenomena. Here are the specific changes:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (Modified):**  
   Original: \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0\)  
   **New:** \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m\)  
   \( \rho_m \) = Magnetic charge density.

2. **Faraday's Law (Modified):**  
   Original: \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\)  
   **New:** \(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}\)  
   \( \mathbf{J}_m \) = Magnetic current density.

3. **Ampère's Law (Unchanged):**  
   \(\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_e + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}\)  
   \( \mathbf{J}_e \) = Electric current density.

4. **Gauss's Law for Electricity (Unchanged):**  
   \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}\)

**Symmetry Achieved:**  
Electric and magnetic fields now have analogous charge densities (\( \rho_e, \rho_m \)) and current terms (\( \mathbf{J}_e, \mathbf{J}_m \)), restoring duality in Maxwell's equations.

In our universe, the absence of magnetic monopoles results in Maxwell’s equations where the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (Gauss's Law for magnetism) and Faraday's Law of Induction does not include a magnetic current term. However, in a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles exist, the equations would differ as follows:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: In our universe, this is given by \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \). With magnetic monopoles, the divergence of \( \mathbf{B} \) would be proportional to the magnetic charge density \( \rho_m \). Thus, the equation becomes:
   \[
   \boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m}
   \]

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: In our universe, this is \( \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \). If magnetic monopoles exist, a term for the magnetic current density \( \mathbf{J}_m \) must be included, leading to:
   \[
   \boxed{\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}
   \]

These changes reflect the symmetry between electric and magnetic fields when magnetic monopoles are present. The other two Maxwell equations (Gauss's Law for electric fields and Ampère's Law) remain unchanged in form, though the sources (charge densities and currents) they describe would include both electric and magnetic contributions as needed.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 If we genuinely desire dual equations (as Dirac propose in the context of monopoles), then each 'type' of current affects the opposite field's curl. Hence:

Electric charges produce electric field divergence,
Magnetic charges produce magnetic field divergence,

Electric currents (moving electric charges) influence magnetic field curl,
Magnetic currents (possibly moving magnetic charges) influence electric field curl.

Therefore, integrating realistic physics here. If these Maxwell equations are to embody complete duality, then:

1. \( \nabla \cdot E = \rho_e / \epsilon_0 \).
2. \( \nabla \cdot B = \mu_0 \rho_m \).
3. \( \nabla \times E = -\partial B / \partial t - \mu_0 J_m \).
4. \nabla \times B = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \partial E / \partial t + \mu_0 J_e \).

Here, \( J_e \) is the electric current, primarily attributed to moving electric charges, and \( J_m \) is the analogous magnetic current. Hence, equations 2 and 3 would be affected. In original Maxwell's equations without monopoles, equations 2 doesn't have \( \rho_m \), and equation 3 doesn't have \( J_m \).

Therefore, changing Gauss's Law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3) would differ. Ampère's Law (equation 4) is altered if magnetic displacement current is implied, but standard treatment, even when admitting magnetic charges, might not change Ampère's Law except for symmetry if displ current us present. Alternatively, electrical part – Ampère’s Law still involves electric current and the electric displacement, but Faraday's Law would now involve magnetic current and magnetic displacement.

Check Dirac’s work on magnetic monopoles; when he proposed them, he amended Maxwell’s equations, but instances have to account for:

For consistency in the presence of magnetic charges and currents, precisely, which equations get modified. Commonly, standard answer is Gauss for magnetism and Faraday.

Yes, to answer: If there are magnetic monopoles, then:

∇·B = μ₀ρ_magnetic

and

∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_magnetic

Thus, altering in Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law.

Hence, equations 2 and 3 would be different.

Another line of thought; how does the existence of magnetic charge affect conservation laws. Electric charge conservation stems from ∇·J_e + ∂ρ_e/∂t = 0. Similarly, if magnetic charge exists, ∇·J_m + ∂ρ_m/∂t = 0.

But altering the Maxwell equations would require that their divergence and curl reflect the new density and current.

Back to original question – in a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles exist, which Maxwell equations are altered?

Traditionally, Maxwell’s four equations.

The first is Gauss’ Law ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. That relates to electric charges, so if we're not altering electric properties, this remains same.

Second, Gauss for magnetism ∇·B = 0. With monopoles, this becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m.

Third, Faraday’s Law ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. May need to add term relating to magnetic current.

Fourth, Ampère’s Law ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. Unlikely changed if there's a separate magnetic current. Wait, convention suggested in this question is only considering current of electric charges and displacement due to E-field, while Fara's Law includes a term for magnetic current.

Alternatively, in full symmetrization, Ampere’s would have (magnetic) displacement current and electric current. But I think, in this scenario, only Faraday's law gets modified.

In usual derivations that include magnetic monopoles, you actually adjust two of the equations, and they gain symmetry.

Yes, so change the second and third equations. Hence, the answer is Gauss’s Law for magnetism becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, akin to ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀. Faraday’s Law becomes ∇×E = −μ₀ J_m − ∂B/∂t, compared to Ampère’s ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. So yes, the Faraday gets a new term, similar to Ampère.

Therefore, these two equations (originally Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law) become different.

In summary, the original equations (without monopoles):

1. ∇·E = ρ_e /ε₀

2. ∇·B = 0

3. ∇×E = –∂B/∂t

4. ∇×B = μ₀ J_e + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

With monopoles, equations 2 and 3 become:

2. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m

3. ∇×E = –μ₀ J_m – ∂B/∂t

Hence, equations that change are equations 2 and 3.

But looking at different sources, like textbooks or articles, when magnetic monopoles are considered, commonly they tweak the divergence of B and Faraday's Law. So the answer is Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law of Induction.

Yes, so in the alternate universe where there are isolated North and South poles (magnetic monopoles), the altered Maxwell equations would be Gauss’s Law for magnetism and Faraday’s Law. Thus, those two equations would differ from our universe's standard Maxwell equations.

**Final Answer**
The Maxwell equations that would be different are Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law of Induction. In this universe, they would be:  
\boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m}  
and  
\boxed{\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}
