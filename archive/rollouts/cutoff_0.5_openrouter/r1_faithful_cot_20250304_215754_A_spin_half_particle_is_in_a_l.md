To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we use the linearity of expectation values. The expectation value is calculated as \(10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle\).

1. **Calculating \(\langle \sigma_z \rangle\):**
   - The state is normalized as \((0.5)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 1\).
   - The eigenvalues of \(\sigma_z\) are +1 for \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and -1 for \(|\downarrow\rangle\).
   - Expectation value: 
     \[
     \langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2 \cdot 1 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
     \]
   - Contribution from \(10\sigma_z\): \(10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5\)

2. **Calculating \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle\):**
   - The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_x\) is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\).
   - Acting on the state vector \(\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}\), we get:
     \[
     \sigma_x \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Inner product with the original state:
     \[
     \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
     \]
   - Contribution from \(5\sigma_x\): \(5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 4.33\)

3. **Summing the contributions:**
   \[
   10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
   \]
   - Rounded to one decimal place: \(-0.7\)

Thus, the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a spin-half particle in a superposition state: 0.5 times the spin-up state plus sqrt(3)/2 times the spin-down state. And we need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, alright. Let me recall how expectation values work in quantum mechanics.\n\nFirst, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured that observable on the system in the given state. The formula is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ for an operator O and state |ψ⟩. So in this case, our operator is 10σz + 5σx, and the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. \n\nI need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. Since expectation value is linear, this is the same as 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. So, I can compute each part separately and then add them up. That makes it manageable.\n\nFirst, let's work out ⟨σz⟩. The σz operator is diagonal in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Its eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for those states respectively. So if our state is a superposition, the expectation value can be found by taking the squared amplitudes of each state and multiplying by their corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nOur state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me verify if this is normalized. The squares of the coefficients should add up to 1. (0.5)^2 = 0.25 and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, okay, so that's good. The state is properly normalized.\n\nSo ⟨σz⟩ would be |0.5|^2 * 1 + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1)? Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues for |↑⟩ is +1 and |↓⟩ is -1. So expectation value is (probability of up)*1 + (probability of down)*(-1). \n\nYes, so probability of up is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, probability of down is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Okay, so that part gives -0.5. Then multiplying by 10, we get 10*(-0.5) = -5 for that term. Alright.\n\nNow moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which is off-diagonal. Its matrix representation is [[0,1],[1,0]]. In terms of spin states, σx flips the spin. I remember that |→⟩ and |←⟩ (right and left eigenstates) are the eigenstates of σx. Maybe I need to find ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. But how do you actually compute that? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the density matrix or compute explicitly using matrix multiplication. Let's see. Let me represent |↑⟩ as a column vector [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ as [0, 1]^T. Then σx is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], right?\n\nGiven that our state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩, let's write that as a vector: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Then σx acting on |ψ⟩ would be [[0,1],[1,0]]*[0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the inner product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. Let me compute this.\n\nFirst component times first component: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4. Second component times second component: (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = (sqrt(3))/4. So total inner product is (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Then multiplying by 5, gives 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33.\n\nTherefore, adding the two parts together, 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.666... So up to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7. Wait, but let me just check my calculations again to make sure.\n\nWait, is ⟨σx⟩ indeed sqrt(3)/2? Let's double-check the matrix multiplication. The state vector for |ψ⟩ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Then σx|ψ⟩ = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], as the first component becomes 0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2) and the second becomes 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2). Then the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5). Both terms are the same, so 2*(0.5*sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5*sqrt(3). Hmm, wait, here let me calculate it step by step:\n\nFirst term: 0.5 multiplied by sqrt(3)/2 is (0.5 * sqrt(3))/2 = sqrt(3)/4.\nSecond term: sqrt(3)/2 multiplied by 0.5 is also sqrt(3)/4.\nAdding them up gives sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which is correct. Okay, so √3/2 is around 0.866, so 5*(0.866) is apprx 4.33.\n\nBut hold on, wait a second: does the sign matter here? Because σx is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real, but when you compute the expectation value... no, shouldn't the inner product give a real number here. Let's confirm. In this calculation, the numbers are real because all components in the vector are real. So σx acting on a real vector also gives a real vector. Therefore the inner product is real. The expectation value is indeed real and equal to sqrt(3)/2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the two terms: 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5, and 5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈4.33. Then the sum is -5 + 4.33 = -0.666..., which is approximately -0.7 to one decimal place. Alternatively, since √3 is approximately 1.732, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so 0.866 *5 ≈4.33. So total is -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. Yes.\n\nWait, just a moment. Maybe we should carry out the calculation more precisely, without approximating √3? Let's check. Since √3 ≈1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660. Multiply by 5 gives 5*0.8660=4.330, exact. Then the sum, -5 +4.330 = -0.670. Up to one decimal place, it's -0.7. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want an exact fractional expression? Let me see. sqrt(3)/2 is exactly (sqrt(3))/2. So 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5sqrt(3))/2. Then 10*(-1/2) + (5sqrt(3))/2 = -5 + (5sqrt(3))/2. Wait, no. Let's see. 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5, and 5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2)=5sqrt(3)/2. So total expectation value is -5 + (5sqrt(3))/2.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects the exact value in decimal, up to one decimal place. So (5*1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 =4.33, which is approximately 4.3. Then again, -5 +4.3 is -0.7. So to one decimal place, it's -0.7. So the answer should be -0.7.\n\nHowever, I should also verify if my initial splitting into expectation values is correct. Let me recollect. The expectation value of a sum of operators is the sum of the expectation values, yes. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ =10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So that step is correct.\n\nLet me also compute this using matrix representation more directly. Maybe this would help verify. The operator 10σz +5σx. Let's express it as a matrix. \nσz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so 10σz is [[10,0],[0,-10]]. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so 5σx is [[0,5],[5,0]]. So the sum is [[10,5],[5,-10]]. Then the matrix operator is [[10,5],[5,-10]].\n\nThen the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So the expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [[10,5],[5,-10]] multiplied by [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply the matrix [[10,5],[5,-10]] with the vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Let's compute component-wise.\nThe first component is 10*0.5 +5*(sqrt(3)/2) =5 + (5sqrt(3))/2.\nThe second component is 5*0.5 + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2) =2.5 -5sqrt(3).\n\nNow, take the dot product of this result with the original vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So we have:

0.5*(5 + (5sqrt(3))/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 -5sqrt(3))

Let's compute each term:

First term: 0.5*5 = 2.5, and 0.5*(5sqrt(3)/2) = (5sqrt(3))/4. So total first term: 2.5 +1.25sqrt(3).

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2)*2.5 = (2.5sqrt(3))/2 =1.25sqrt(3), and (sqrt(3)/2)*(-5sqrt(3)) = (-5*(sqrt(3))^2)/2 = (-5*3)/2 = -15/2 = -7.5.

So adding the two parts: (2.5 +1.25sqrt(3)) + (1.25sqrt(3) -7.5) = 2.5 -7.5 +2.5sqrt(3) = -5 +2.5sqrt(3).\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Wait. So in that case, -5 +2.5sqrt(3). Since sqrt(3)≈1.732, then 2.5*1.732=4.33. Then -5 +4.33≈-0.67, which again is approximately -0.7. So this matches our previous answer. So this means both methods yield the same result. That gives me confidence that it's correct. \n\nSo either by breaking into the expectation values separately and then adding them, or by composing the operator and acting on the state, we end up with the same value. Great. Therefore, regardless of whether done step by step or all at once, the expectation value is -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2 ≈ -5 +4.330≈-0.67≈-0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.\n\nThus the final answer should be \boxed{-0.7}.\n\nI don't think there's a trick or anything here. The question was straightforward once we recall how expectation values work for combined operators. The key was realizing linearity allows us to split the expectation values for each operator part. Calculating each part separately seems manageable. Messy part was just handling the coefficients while making sure multiplications are correct. So confirms, final answer as -0.7.

Let me compute this.\n\nFirst component times first component: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4. Second component times second component: (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 = (sqrt(3))/4. So total inner product is (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Then multiplying by 5, gives 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33.\n\nTherefore, adding the two parts together, 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.666... So up to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7.

Let me work through this quantum mechanics problem. We're dealing with a spin-half particle in a superposition state, described by 0.5 times the spin-up state plus sqrt(3)/2 times the spin-down state. Our task is to calculate the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx.

The expectation value in quantum mechanics represents the average measurement outcome and is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is our operator and |ψ⟩ is our state. Due to linearity, we can split this into 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ and evaluate each term independently.

Starting with ⟨σz⟩, we can use the fact that σz is diagonal in the up-down basis with eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. First, let's verify our state normalization: (0.5)² + (sqrt(3)/2)² = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, confirming proper normalization.

For ⟨σz⟩, we multiply each probability by its corresponding eigenvalue: (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Multiplying by 10 gives us -5 for the first term.

Moving to ⟨σx⟩, we need to use matrix representation. With σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], |↑⟩ = [1,0]ᵀ, and |↓⟩ = [0,1]ᵀ, our state |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]ᵀ. Applying σx to |ψ⟩ gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]ᵀ.

Computing ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ through inner product calculation: (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Multiplying by 5 gives approximately 4.33.

Therefore, the total expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩ = -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.7.

A final verification of the σx calculation confirms this result: the inner product components (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) indeed sum to sqrt(3)/2, validating our computation.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let me work on understanding this problem. We have a spin-half particle in a superposition defined as 0.5 of the spin-up state plus √3/2 of the spin-down state. Our task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Let me think about how expectation values are used in quantum mechanics.

I recall that the expectation value of an operator represents the average value one would expect when measuring that observable on the system in the described state. The expression for this is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator, and |ψ⟩ is the state. Hence, for our problem, the operator is 10σz + 5σx, and the state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

We need to evaluate ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. Due to the linearity of expectation values, it's equivalent to 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ + 5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. By analyzing these components separately and summing them, the process becomes simpler.

First, let’s determine ⟨σz⟩. The σz operator is diagonal in the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ basis, possessing eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. For a superposition state, the expectation value is determined by squaring the amplitudes of each state and multiplying them by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Our superposition is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. To verify normalization, the squares of the coefficients should total 1. (0.5)^2 equals 0.25, and (√3/2)^2 equals 3/4. Thus, 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, which confirms proper normalization.

Therefore, ⟨σz⟩ equals |0.5|^2 * 1 plus |√3/2|^2 * (-1). Actually, this means (probability of up)*1 plus (probability of down)*(-1).

So, the probability of the up state is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and the down state is |√3/2|^2 = 0.75. Consequently, ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. This means 10 times -0.5 equals -5 for this term.

Next, computing ⟨σx⟩. The Pauli x matrix, σx, is off-diagonal, represented by [[0,1],[1,0]]. It flips the spin state, and I remember the eigenstates of σx are |→⟩ and |←⟩. Determining ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ requires consideration. Here’s the approach.

We could express the density matrix or compute explicitly through matrix operations. Considering |↑⟩ as column vector [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ as [0, 1]^T, the matrix σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

Given our state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩, it corresponds to vector [0.5, √3/2]^T. Operating σx on |ψ⟩: [[0,1],[1,0]]*[0.5, √3/2]^T = [√3/2, 0.5]^T. Now, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ involves the inner product between [0.5, √3/2] and [√3/2, 0.5].

Multiplying the first components: 0.5*(√3/2) = √3/4. Second components: (√3/2)*0.5 = √3/4. Summing the inner products: √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2. Thus, ⟨σx⟩ equals √3/2, approximately 0.866. The product with 5 provides 5*(√3/2) approximating 5*0.866, about 4.33.

Cumulatively, 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩ results in -5 + 4.33 approximately yielding -0.666… So, rounded to one decimal place, it’s roughly -0.7. Permit me to re-evaluate my computation accuracy.

Let’s verify: does ⟨σx⟩ truly equal √3/2? Confirming matrix multiplication again, the vector for |ψ⟩ is [0.5; √3/2]. Then, σx|ψ⟩ equals [√3/2; 0.5], with the first component calculated as 0*0.5 + 1*(√3/2) and the second as 1*0.5 + 0*(√3/2). Thus, the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ computes to (0.5)*(√3/2) + (√3/2)*(0.5). Since both elements are equivalent, it sums to 2*(0.5*√3/2) = 0.5*√3.

To calculate with precision:

First term: 0.5 times √3/2 is (0.5 * √3)/2 = √3/4.
Second term: √3/2 times 0.5 equals √3/4.
Adding these equals √3/2, or approximately 0.866. The value √3/2 computes to 0.866, and 5 * 0.866 approximates to 4.33.

Importantly, does the sign play a role here? Considering σx is Hermitian, its eigenvalues remain real; nevertheless, the expectation value’s computation consistently results in a real number.

Given a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we need to find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\).

1. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_z\):**
   - The state \(|\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\) is normalized.
   - The probabilities are \(|0.5|^2 = 0.25\) for \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and \(\left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75\) for \(|\downarrow\rangle\).
   - The expectation value of \(\sigma_z\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot 1 + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
     \]
   - Multiply by 10:
     \[
     10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5
     \]

2. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_x\):**
   - The matrix representation of \(\sigma_x\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\).
   - The state vector \(|\psi\rangle\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix}\).
   - Applying \(\sigma_x\) to \(|\psi\rangle\) gives \(\begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{pmatrix}\).
   - The inner product \(\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle\) is:
     \[
     0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
     \]
   - Multiply by 5:
     \[
     5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5 \cdot 0.866 = 4.33
     \]

3. **Total expectation value:**
   - Summing the contributions from \(\sigma_z\) and \(\sigma_x\):
     \[
     10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.666\ldots
     \]
   - Rounded to one decimal place, this is approximately \(-0.7\).

The expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for the given spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle is calculated as follows:

1. **State Normalization Check**:
   The state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \) is already normalized since:
   \[
   (0.5)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1
   \]

2. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_z\)**:
   \[
   \langle\sigma_z\rangle = \left(0.5\right)^2(1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
   \]
   Thus, \(10\langle\sigma_z\rangle = 10 \times (-0.5) = -5\).

3. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_x\)**:
   Using matrix representation:
   \[
   \sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   Compute \(\sigma_x|\psi\rangle\):
   \[
   \sigma_x|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   \langle\psi|\sigma_x|\psi\rangle = 0.5 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
   \]
   Multiply by 5: \(5 \times 0.866 \approx 4.33\).

4. **Total Expectation Value**:
   \[
   10\langle\sigma_z\rangle + 5\langle\sigma_x\rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.7
   \]

**Answer**: \(\boxed{-0.7}\)

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

Exactly, 4.33..., but in exact terms, it is 5*(√3/2) equals (5√3)/2 (approximately 5*1.732/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈ 4.33). Therefore, adding as per exact terms: 10*⟨σz⟩= 10*( - 1/2 )= -5, and 5⟨σx⟩ = 5*(√3/2). Therefore, exact value is -5 + (5√3)/2.\n\nCalculating the numerical approximate: √3 ≈1.732, so 5*1.732=8.66, divide by 2: 4.33. Therefore, total expectation is -5 +4.33 ≈ -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. However, perhaps I made a mistake in decimal approximation.\n\nRight? Let's check again. If the exact result is (10*(-0.5) ) + (5*(sqrt(3)/2)): -5 + (5*sqrt(3)/2). Squaring this into a calculator: sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 5*1.732 = 8.66; 8.66 divided by 2 is 4.33. Therefore, 4.33 -5 = -0.666..., which rounds to -0.7. So, up to one decimal, yes. Deducting 0.666, that's as outlined. But Perhaps I should confirm through exact terms.\n\nAlternatively, entering 5√3 into calculator:\n\nBut assuming that the computer might need more exact steps, maybe during writing w/ the exact value? However, since the problem says up to one decimal place, so we know -0.7. Alternatively, if another decimal.\n\nBut wait, 5 times sqrt(3)/2 is indeed (5*sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute it with better accuracy.  The general way:\n\nFirst term: 10σ_z ⇒ expectation is 10*(0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1)) =10*(0.25 - 0.75)= 10*(-0.5)= -5.\n\nSecond term: 5σ_x, with expectation 5*(√3/2). Let's compute 5*(1.732)/2: 5*0.8660=4.330. Then adding to -5: 4.330 -5= -0.67, this is ~-0.67, which rounds up to -0.7 when we approximate to one decimal.\n\nHence, the answer is \\boxed{-0.7}\n\nHowever, the assistant must be precise. Let me just recount to avoid any mistake.\n\nComponents:\n\nState vector |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2) |↓⟩.\n\nTo compute ⟨σ_z⟩: probabilities of |↑⟩ =0.25, |↓⟩ =0.75.

Given a spin-half particle in the superposition state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we need to find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\).

First, we calculate the expectation value of \(\sigma_z\). The eigenstates of \(\sigma_z\) are \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and \(|\downarrow\rangle\) with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. The probabilities for the states \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and \(|\downarrow\rangle\) are \(|0.5|^2 = 0.25\) and \(\left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75\). Therefore, the expectation value of \(\sigma_z\) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot 1 + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]
Multiplying by 10, we get:
\[
10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5
\]

Next, we calculate the expectation value of \(\sigma_x\). The operator \(\sigma_x\) is represented by the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\). Applying \(\sigma_x\) to the state vector \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\) (which corresponds to the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{pmatrix}\)) results in \(\begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{pmatrix}\). The inner product of the original state vector and this result is:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Multiplying by 5, we get:
\[
5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33
\]

Summing the contributions from both operators:
\[
10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
\]

Rounded to one decimal place, the expectation value is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

 In matrix terms, ∂ x ∂ so the expectation value is indeed 0.866.

Therefore, combining both operators: 10*(-0.5) + 5*(0.866) gives -5 + 4.33. Exactly, 4.33..., but in exact terms, it is 5*(√3/2) equals (5√3)/2 (approximately 5*1.732/2 ≈ 8.66/2 ≈ 4.33). Therefore, adding as per exact terms: 10*⟨σz⟩= 10*( - 1/2 )= -5, and 5⟨σx⟩ = 5*(√3/2). Therefore, exact value is -5 + (5√3)/2.

Calculating the numerical approximate: √3 ≈1.732, so 5*1.732=8.66, divide by 2: 4.33. Therefore, total expectation is -5 +4.33 ≈ -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. However, perhaps I made a mistake in decimal approximation.

Right? Let's check again. If the exact result is (10*(-0.5) ) + (5*(sqrt(3)/2)): -5 + (5*sqrt(3)/2). Squaring this into a calculator: sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 5*1.732 = 8.66; 8.66 divided by 2 is 4.33. Therefore, 4.33 -5 = -0.666..., which rounds to -0.7. So, up to one decimal, yes. Deducting 0.666, that's as outlined. But Perhaps I should confirm through exact terms.

Alternatively, entering 5√3 into calculator:

But assuming that the computer might need more exact steps, maybe during writing w/ the exact value? However, since the problem says up to one decimal place, so we know -0.7. Alternatively, if another decimal.

But wait, 5 times sqrt(3)/2 is indeed (5*sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute it with better accuracy.  The general way:

First term: 10σ_z ⇒ expectation is 10*(0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1)) =10*(0.25 - 0.75)= 10*(-0.5)= -5.

Second term: 5σ_x, with expectation 5*(√3/2). Let's compute 5*(1.732)/2: 5*0.8660=4.330. Then adding to -5: 4.330 -5= -0.67, this is ~-0.67, which rounds up to -0.7 when we approximate to one decimal.

Hence, the answer is \boxed{-0.7}

However, the assistant must be precise. Let me just recount to avoid any mistake.

Components:

State vector |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2) |↓⟩.

To compute ⟨σ_z⟩: probabilities of |↑⟩ =0.25, |↓⟩ =0.75. Eigenvalues for σz being +1 and -1, so 0.25*1 +0.75*(-1)= -0.5.

Multiply by 10, gives -5.

σx's expectation value: As per matrix multiplication, yes, after calculation, it is √3/2. So 5*(√3 /2) ≈ 4.33... Add to -5: -0.66· · ·, so -0.67. Rounded to one decimal, that's -0.7.

But to be accurate in steps:

Exact expectation value:

⟨σ_z⟩ = |0.5|^2*(1) + |sqrt{3}/2|^2*(-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5

⟨σ_x⟩: Amplitudes cvurrently (c1 c2) = (0.5, sqrt3/2). Then, σ_x interchanges spin:

⟨ψ | σ_x | ψ ⟩ = (0.5 sqrt3/2)( (0 , 1; 1,0) [0.5; sqrt3/2] )

Which is inner product of [0.5, sqrt3/2] with [sqrt3/2, 0.5]

So that is 0.5*(sqrt3/2) + (sqrt3/2)*0.5 = sqrt3/4 + sqrt3/4 = sqrt3/2, just as done before.

Which, again, is about 0.8660. Then times 5 gives ≈4.330. So total expectation is 4.330 -5= -0.670. Therefore, rnded to 1 decimal, say 0.7 with negative.

Therefore yes, the answer is \boxed{-0.7}

**Final Answer**
The expectation value of the operator is \boxed{-0.7}.
