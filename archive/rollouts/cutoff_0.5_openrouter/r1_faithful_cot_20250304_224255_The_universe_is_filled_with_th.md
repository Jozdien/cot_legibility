To determine the energy of gamma-rays that would have their lifetimes limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we need to consider the threshold energy required for this process. 

1. **Threshold Energy Calculation**:
   - The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is $0.511$ MeV. Therefore, the combined rest mass energy for an electron-positron pair is $2 \times 0.511$ MeV = $1.022$ MeV.
   - The threshold condition for the annihilation process is that the product of the energies of the two photons (high-energy gamma-ray and CMB photon) must be at least equal to the square of the rest mass energy of the electron pair. This is derived from the center-of-momentum (CM) energy considerations.
   - The CM energy squared ($s$) for the two photons is given by $s = 4 E_1 E_2$, where $E_1$ is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray and $E_2$ is the energy of the CMB photon.
   - Setting $s$ equal to $(2 m_e c^2)^2$ gives the threshold condition:
     \[
     4 E_1 E_2 \geq (2 m_e c^2)^2
     \]
   - Solving for $E_1$:
     \[
     E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}
     \]

2. **Substitute Values**:
   - The rest mass energy of the electron $m_e c^2 = 0.511$ MeV = $0.511 \times 10^6$ eV.
   - The average energy of a CMB photon $E_2 = 10^{-3}$ eV.
   - Plugging these values into the equation:
     \[
     E_1 \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
     \]
     \[
     E_1 \geq \frac{(0.511)^2 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
     \]
     \[
     E_1 \geq 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}
     \]
     Converting to tera-electron volts (TeV):
     \[
     1 \, \text{TeV} = 10^{12} \, \text{eV} \implies E_1 \geq 261 \, \text{TeV}
     \]

Thus, the energy of the gamma-rays at which their lifetimes in the universe would be limited by this process is approximately \boxed{260 \text{ TeV}}.

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy of gamma-rays that would be annihilated by interacting with the CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average energy of the CMB photon is given as 10^-3 eV. Let me start by recalling the basic physics involved.

First, particle physics tells us that the process gamma + gamma -> e+ e- is possible if the combined energy of the two photons is sufficient to create the electron and positron. Since electrons and positrons have rest mass, the energy has to be at least equal to their combined rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so for two particles, that's around 1.022 MeV. So the sum of the energies of the two photons needs to be at least 1.022 MeV.

But wait, photons are quantum particles, so maybe this isn't just a simple sum? Maybe it's about relativistic invariants. Let me recall the concept of the center-of-momentum (CM) energy. For a two-body collision, the threshold occurs when the total energy in the CM frame is equal to twice the rest mass energy of the electron (since we’re creating two electrons). So the gamma-ray photon (high energy) and the CMB photon (low energy) collide, and we need their combined energy to reach that threshold.

CM energy squared, s, is given by (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But photons are massless, so their energy is related to their momentum by E = pc. Let me express both photons energies. Let’s denote E_high as the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray photon, and E_low as the energy of the CMB photon, which is 1e-3 eV.

Assuming they are moving directly towards each other, which would give the maximum possible CM energy. In that case, their momenta are opposite, so p1 and p2 have opposite directions. So the total momentum would be (E_high/c - E_low/c), since the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction. Then the expression for s would be:

s = (E_high + E_low)^2 - (E_high - E_low)^2

Because (p1c is E_high, p2c is E_low but in opposite direction, so subtracting. Then when we square (E_high - E_low), but let me expand the equation:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2

But since for photons, E1 = p1c and E2 = p2c. If the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momentum vectors oppose each other. Therefore, the total momentum magnitude is |p1 - p2|. So s becomes:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2

Expanding that:

s = [E1^2 + 2E1E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2E1E2 + E2^2] = 4E1E2

So s = 4 E1 E2, where E1 is the high-energy photon, E2 is the CMB photon.

But we need the CM energy to be at least 2 m_e c^2 (since each electron has energy m_e c^2, and there are two of them). Therefore:

sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c^2

So sqrt(4 E1 E2) >= 2 m_e c^2

Which is equivalent to 2 sqrt(E1 E2) >= 2 m_e c^2

Divide both sides by 2:

sqrt(E1 E2) >= m_e c^2

Square both sides:

E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2

Therefore, solving for E1 (the gamma-ray energy):

E1 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E2

So, substituting values:

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV

E2 = average CMB photon energy, 1e-3 eV

So,

E1 >= (0.511 x 10^6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)

Let me compute that:

First square 0.511 x 10^6 eV: (0.511)^2 x 10^12 (eV)^2

Then divide by 1e-3 eV:

(0.511)^2 x 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 x 10^15 eV

Wait, let's calculate (0.511)^2 first. 0.511 times 0.511 is around 0.261. So:

0.261 x 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV

But converting to units, 1 TeV is 1e12 eV, so this would be 261 TeV?

Wait, 0.261 x 10^15 eV is 2.61 x 10^14 eV. Since 1 TeV is 1e12 eV, that's 261 TeV, right? 261 TeV. Is that the threshold energy? So a gamma-ray photon with energy above about 261 TeV would interact with the CMB photons (which have ~1e-3 eV) and produce electron-positron pairs, which would limit their mean free path in the universe. Therefore, beyond that energy, gamma-rays cannot propagate over large distances. 

But wait, in astrophysics, the term used is the "pair production threshold" with the CMB, which sets the limit for the gamma-ray horizon. I've heard that the threshold is around hundreds of TeV, which seems to match this calculation. However, let's verify the calculation:

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV. So squared is (0.511)^2 x 10^12 eV².

Divided by E2 = 1e-3 eV: (0.511^2 x 10^12) / 1e-3 = (0.261 x 10^12) / 1e-3 = 0.261 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV = 261 TeV.

Yup, sounds right. If you have a gamma-ray photon, say with energy 300 TeV, then with a CMB photon (1e-3 eV), the product is 3e14 * 1e-3 = 3e11 eV². Wait, no: when we use that formula E1 * E2 >= (m_e c²)^2, so to achieve equality, we found E1=261 TeV. So 261 TeV * 1e-3 eV = (261e12 eV) * (1e-3 eV) = 261e9 eV²? But (m_e c²)^2 is 0.261e12 e V²? Wait, maybe my units cross-check is better here:

m_e c² in eV: 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV. So squared is 511,000^2 eV² = approximately 261,121,000,000 eV², that is 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

So (m_e c²)^2 is 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

Therefore, E1 >= (2.61e11 eV²) / E2. Since E2 is 1e-3 eV:

E1 >= 2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV.

Convert that to TeV: 1 TeV=1e12 eV, so 2.61e14 eV / 1e12 eV/TeV = 261 TeV. Exactly.

Hmm, so 261 TeV is the threshold energy. Therefore, gamma-rays with energy higher than this would annihilate with CMB photons. Therefore, these high-energy gamma-rays would have their mean free path limited by this process. So the answer should be around 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV. But in the exact calculation, 261 TeV. However, sometimes similar problems use approximations like m_e c^2 ~ 0.5 MeV, leading to approximately (0.5 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = 0.25e12 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 0.25e15 eV = 250 TeV. So 261 is precise, but 250 is approximate.

However, the CMB photon energy is an average. Wait, the CMB has a blackbody spectrum peaking at around 1e-3 eV. But photons in a blackbody spectrum have a range of energies. The average is maybe closer to ~6e-4 eV (since the average of a blackbody is about 2.7 kT, versus the peak at ~1.6 kT). But the problem states the average photon energy is 10^-3 eV, so we can take that value as given, even if physically the actual average is slightly different. So assuming E_CMB = 1e-3 eV, the calculation stands.

Therefore, the gamma-ray photon needs an energy of at least 261 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays of such energy or higher would effectively interact with CMB and get absorbed via pair production.

Wait, but actually, the cross-section for this process peaks just above the threshold, so effectively, the gamma-rays above this energy have a shorter mean free path. So the threshold itself is 261 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above this value would have their lifetimes (or propagation distances) limited by annihilation on the CMB.

Hence, the answer should be approximately 261 TeV. However, perhaps sometimes you represent it in other units. Let me confirm if it's 1e14 eV? 1e14 eV is 100 TeV. So again, there is a factor of ~2-3 difference. Since the problem asks "from what energy", we should give the exact value based on given data. So given E_CMB = 1e-3 eV and m_e = 0.511 MeV, the answer is (0.511e6)^2 /1e-3 = 261e12 eV = 261 TeV.

So probably expects the answer expressed in units, maybe in EeV? 0.261 EeV. But 1 EeV is 1e18 eV; however 261 TeV is 261e12 eV = 2.61e14 eV. No, EeV is higher. So the standard unit here would be TeV. So likely, around 260 TeV.

But wait for another consideration. The problem mentions the lifetime of the gamma-ray being limited by this process. The lifetime would be dictated by the interaction rate. The cross-section for pair production depends on energy. However, when computing the threshold, which gives the minimum energy required for the process to occur. However, even if the energy is just above the threshold, the cross-section does not abruptly become zero below that energy, but rather, at threshold, only the head-on collisions would contribute. For photons below the threshold energy, even for the most favorable collision angle, the process can't occur. Therefore, the key point is that above the threshold energy, interactions become possible, so the gamma rays would scatter (and hence lose energy) through these pair production events. Therefore, that is the threshold over which their mean free path becomes finite, hence their lifetime (time before interacting) is limited. Below that energy, such interactions do not occur, so gamma-rays can travel freely. Hence, the critical energy is the one where E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB. Therefore, 261 TeV.

So wrapping up...

First, invert the problem. Assumptions:

Two photons collide to produce electron-positron pair. High-energy photon (gamma-ray) plus a CMB photon (mean energy 1e-3 eV). To produce e+e-, need that the combined energy in the center of mass frame is sufficient. As calculated, s = 4 E1 E2, since s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2......

**Final Answer**
The energy of the gamma-rays is limited to approximately \boxed{260 \text{ TeV}}.

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy of gamma-rays that would be annihilated by interacting with the CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The average energy of the CMB photon is given as 10^-3 eV. Let me start by recalling the basic physics involved.

Since electrons and positrons have rest mass, the energy has to be at least equal to their combined rest mass energy.

So the gamma-ray photon (high energy) and the CMB photon (low energy) collide, and we need their combined energy to reach that threshold.

CM energy squared, s, is given by (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. But photons are massless, so their energy is related to their momentum by E = pc. Let me express both photons energies. Let’s denote E_high as the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray photon, and E_low as the energy of the CMB photon, which is 1e-3 eV.

Assuming they are moving directly towards each other, which would give the maximum possible CM energy. In that case, their momenta are opposite, so p1 and p2 have opposite directions. So the total momentum would be (E_high/c - E_low/c), since the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction. Then the expression for s would be:

s = (E_high + E_low)^2 - (E_high - E_low)^2

Because (p1c is E_high, p2c is E_low but in opposite direction, so subtracting. Then when we square (E_high - E_low), but let me expand the equation:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2

But since for photons, E1 = p1c and E2 = p2c. If the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momentum vectors oppose each other. Therefore, the total momentum magnitude is |p1 - p2|. So s becomes:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2

Expanding that:

s = [E1^2 + 2E1E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2E1E2 + E2^2] = 4E1E2

So s = 4 E1 E2, where E1 is the high-energy photon, E2 is the CMB photon.

But we need the CM energy to be at least 2 m_e c^2 (since each electron has energy m_e c^2, and there are two of them). Therefore:

sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c^2

So sqrt(4 E1 E2) >= 2 m_e c^2

Which is equivalent to 2 sqrt(E1 E2) >= 2 m_e c^2

Divide both sides by 2:

sqrt(E1 E2) >= m_e c^2

Square both sides:

E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2

Therefore, solving for E1 (the gamma-ray energy):

E1 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E2

So, substituting values:

m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV

E2 = average CMB photon energy, 1e-3 eV

So,

E1 >= (0.511 x 10^6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)

Let me compute that:

First square 0.511 x 10^6 eV: (0.511)^2 x 10^12 (eV)^2

Then divide by 1e-3 eV:

(0.511)^2 x 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 x 10^15 eV

Wait, let's calculate (0.511)^2 first. 0.511 times 0.511 is around 0.261. So:

0.261 x 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV

But converting to units, 1 TeV is 1e12 eV, so this would be 261 TeV?

Wait, 0.261 x 10^15 eV is 2.61 x 10^14 eV. Since 1 TeV is 1e12 eV, that's 261 TeV, right? 261 TeV. Is that the threshold energy?

Let me work through determining what energy gamma-rays would need to interact with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons to create electron-positron pairs. We know the CMB photons have an average energy of 10^-3 eV, so let's analyze this step by step.

In particle physics, when two photons interact to produce an electron-positron pair (gamma + gamma -> e+ e-), they must have enough combined energy to create both particles. Each electron or positron has a rest mass energy of 0.511 MeV, requiring a total of 1.022 MeV for the pair.

However, this isn't a simple addition of energies. We need to consider relativistic effects and use the center-of-momentum (CM) frame energy. For two photons colliding, the threshold occurs when their CM energy equals twice the electron rest mass energy.

For massless particles like photons, energy equals momentum times the speed of light (E = pc). Consider two photons colliding head-on (maximizing CM energy): one high-energy gamma-ray (E_high) and one low-energy CMB photon (E_low = 10^-3 eV).

The CM energy squared (s) can be expressed as:
s = (E_high + E_low)^2 - (E_high - E_low)^2

When expanded, this simplifies to:
s = 4 × E_high × E_low

For pair production to occur:
sqrt(s) ≥ 2m_e c^2

Therefore:
2sqrt(E_high × E_low) ≥ 2m_e c^2
sqrt(E_high × E_low) ≥ m_e c^2
E_high × E_low ≥ (m_e c^2)^2

Solving for the gamma-ray energy (E_high):
E_high ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / E_low

Plugging in the values:
m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 10^6 eV
E_low = 10^-3 eV

Therefore:
E_high ≥ (0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 / (10^-3 eV)
= (0.261 × 10^12 eV^2) / (10^-3 eV)
= 0.261 × 10^15 eV
= 2.61 × 10^14 eV
= 261 TeV

This result matches the known "pair production threshold" in astrophysics. Gamma-rays with energies above 261 TeV will interact with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, limiting their ability to travel large cosmic distances. This threshold effectively creates a gamma-ray horizon in the universe.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the energy of gamma rays that can be annihilated through interaction with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons to create electron-positron pairs. We know that the average energy of a CMB photon is approximately 10^-3 eV. To begin, let's remind ourselves of the basic physics concepts involved.

According to particle physics, the reaction gamma + gamma -> e+ e- can occur provided the combined energy of the two photons is enough to generate an electron and a positron. Since both the electron and positron have rest mass, the combined energy of the photons must be at least equal to their total rest mass energy. An electron's rest mass energy is around 0.511 MeV, meaning the total for the pair should be approximately 1.022 MeV. Therefore, the sum of the energies of the two photons should be at least 1.022 MeV.

However, since photons are quantum particles, this process isn't just a straightforward addition of energies; it might involve relativistic invariants. Let's recall the concept of the center-of-momentum (CM) energy. For a two-body collision, the minimum energy needed corresponds to when the total energy in the CM frame equals twice the rest mass energy of the electron (since we're creating two electrons). Hence, when the high-energy gamma-ray photon and the low-energy CMB photon collide, their combined energy must achieve this threshold.

The CM energy squared, s, is calculated using (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. Because photons are massless, their energy relates to momentum with the equation E = pc. Let us express the energies of the photons. We denote E_high as the gamma-ray photon's energy and E_low, or 1e-3 eV, as the energy of the CMB photon.

Assuming they are traveling in opposite directions to maximize possible CM energy, their momenta oppose each other, resulting in a total momentum of (E_high/c - E_low/c). Thus, the expression for s can be written as:

s = (E_high + E_low)^2 - (E_high - E_low)^2

Given that (p1c is E_high, and p2c is E_low but moving oppositely, we subtract them, then square (E_high - E_low). Expanding the equation:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2

For photons, E1 = p1c and E2 = p2c. If they move in opposite directions, their momentum vectors cancel each other, simplifying s to:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2

Further expanding:

s = [E1^2 + 2E1E2 + E2^2] - [E1^2 - 2E1E2 + E2^2] = 4E1E2

Thus, s equals 4 times E1 E2, where E1 is the high-energy photon and E2 is the CMB photon.

However, the CM energy must be at least 2 m_e c^2 (since we're creating two electrons each with m_e c^2 energy). Therefore:

√s ≥ 2 m_e c^2

So √(4 E1 E2) ≥ 2 m_e c^2

This simplifies to 2 √(E1 E2) ≥ 2 m_e c^2

By dividing both sides by 2, we get:

√(E1 E2) ≥ m_e c^2

Squaring both sides results in:

E1 E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2

Thus, to find the gamma-ray energy E1, we have:

E1 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / E2

Substituting the given values:

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV

E2 = average CMB photon energy = 1e-3 eV

So,

E1 ≥ (0.511 x 10^6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV

Let's calculate:

First, (0.511 x 10^6 eV) squared equals (0.511)^2 x 10^12 (eV)^2

Dividing by 1e-3 eV results in:

(0.511)^2 x 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 x 10^15 eV

Calculating (0.511)^2 gives roughly 0.261. Thus:

0.261 x 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV

Understanding the units, 1 TeV equals 1e12 eV, making this energy 261 TeV. Hence, a gamma-ray photon with energy above approximately 261 TeV would interact with CMB photons (having ~1e-3 eV) to produce electron-positron pairs, therefore limiting their mean free path in the universe. Consequently, gamma rays beyond this energy threshold cannot traverse vast distances.

Lastly, in astrophysics, the pair production threshold with the CMB denotes the boundary for the gamma-ray horizon. I've learned that this threshold is in the hundreds of TeV range, consistent with this calculation. To verify:

m_e c² = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV, squared to give (0.511)^2 x 10^12 eV².

Divided by E2 = 1e-3 eV: (0.511^2 x 10^12) / 1e-3 = (0.261 x 10^12) / 1e-3 = 0.261 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV = 261 TeV.

That confirms the result. Therefore, a gamma-ray photon, for instance with 300 TeV energy, combined with a CMB photon (1e-3 eV), would initiate this process.

For photons, \\( s \\) is given by \\( 4E_{\\gamma}E_{\\text{CMB}} \\), where \\( E_{\\gamma} \\) is the gamma-ray energy and \\( E_{\\text{CMB}} \\) is the average CMB photon energy.\n\n2. **Equation Setup**: Setting \\( \\sqrt{4E_{\\gamma}E_{\\text{CMB}}} \\geq 2m_e c^2 \\) leads to:\n   \\[\n   E_{\\gamma} \\geq \\frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\\text{CMB}}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute Values**: Using \\( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \\, \\text{MeV} = 0.511 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{eV} \\) and \\( E_{\\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \\, \\text{eV} \\):\n   \\[\n   E_{\\gamma} \\geq \\frac{(0.511 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \\, \\text{eV}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   E_{\\gamma} \\geq \\frac{0.261 \\times 10^{12} \\, \\text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \\, \\text{eV}} = 2.61 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{eV}\n   \\]\n\nConsidering significant figures, the given CMB photon energy (1e-3 eV) has one significant figure, so the answer is rounded to one significant figure:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}\n\\]', refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=' uct E1 E2 would be 300e12 * 1e-3 = 3e11 eV².\n\nCompared to (m_e c²)^2 = ~0.26e12 eV². Wait, 3e11 is less than 0.26e12 (~2.6e11). Wait, wait a minute, maybe my mental math is off. Wait, 0.511^2 is ~0.261, correct. Squared, so 0.511 MeV squared is (0.511 x 1e6)^2 (eV)^2:\n\n(0.511 x1e6)^2 = 0.261 x 1e12 (eV)^2. So as before.\n\nSo (m_e c²)^2 / E2 = 0.261 x1e12 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 x1e15 eV.\n\nMultiply this, 0.261e15 eV is indeed 261e12 eV, which is 261 TeV.\n\nBut earlier when I substituted 300 TeV for gamma-ray energy, E1 E2 would be 300e12 *1e-3 = 300e9 eV^2, but (m_e c^2)^2 is about 0.261e12 eV^2. So this doesn\'t cross the threshold. Wait, so 300 TeV is way higher than 261 TeV. Wait confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps this is an error. Therefore, if E1 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E2, then plugging numbers again.\n\nCheck formula once again: sqrt(4 E1 E2) >= 2 m_e c²\n\nCancel the 2: sqrt(E1 E2) >= m_e c²\n\nSo E1 E2 >= (m_e c²)^2\n\nThus E1 >= (m_e c²)^2 / E2\n\nIndeed, so rearranged correctly.\n\nAgain:\n\n(m_e c^2)^2 / E2 = ( (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / 1e-3 eV\n\nConvert MeV to eV: 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV\n\nSo squared: (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 eV^2\n\nThen divide by E2=1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV\n\nWhich is 261e12 eV = 261 TeV. So yes, the threshold gamma-ray energy is about 261 TeV. So a 261 TeV gamma-ray interacting with a 1 meV CMB photon would have just enough energy to produce an electron-positron pair.\n\nIf the gamma-ray has energy higher than this, then the product E1 E2 exceeds (m_e c^2)^2, so such a process becomes possible. Therefore, those gamma-rays with energies above ~261 TeV would interact with the CMB photons and produce pairs, which would attenuate them over cosmological distances, effectively limiting their lifetime in the universe.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be around 1e14 eV, which is 100 TeV. Wait, but my exact calculation was ~261 TeV. But 261 is approximately a few hundred TeV. However, the calculation is precise given the inputs, but let me double-check.\n\nLet me compute (0.511e6)^2: 0.511 * 0.511 = 0.261\n\nMultiply by 1e6 squared: 0.261 * 1e12 = 2.61e11\n\nWait, wait, holy cow, (0.511e6)^2 is:\n\n0.511e6 eV = 511,000 eV\n\nSquare that: 511,000^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10 = 2.611e11 eV^2\n\nDivided by 1e-3 eV:\n\n2.611e11 / 1e-3 = 2.611e14 eV = 261.1 TeV\n\nYes, that\'s 261.1 TeV. So order of hundreds of TeV.\n\nTherefore, the gamma-rays with energy above ~260 TeV would start annihilating with CMB photons. Thus, their propagation is limited. So the answer is ~3x10^14 eV? Wait, 1 TeV is 1e12 eV, so 260 TeV would be 2.6e2 TeV = 2.6e14 eV. Wait, 1 TeV = 1e12 eV, right? So 261 TeV would be 261e12 eV, which is 2.61e14 eV. So around ~3 x 10^14 eV. So 3e14 eV. Hmm. So the notation: \n\nThe energy is 261 TeV, which is 2.61 x 10^14 eV.\n\nSo written in proper scientific notation, that\'s 2.6 x 10^14 eV. The question asks, "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So answer 10^14 eV scale. However, exact value is 200-300 TeV, but the precise value comes out around 261 TeV. But maybe need to present as \\sim 10^{14} eV, but let me check some references in mind.\n\nWait, if I remember correctly, the threshold for pair production against CMB is usually quoted to be around 10^{14} eV, which is 0.1 PeV or 100 TeV, but in reality, calculation shows 261 TeV which is 2.6 x 10^14. So maybe in some contexts, they may consider the exact value. Given that the problem mentions "lifetimes in the universe limited by this process", so if high-energy gamma-rays can interact with the CMB (which is omnipresent) they effectively have a short mean free path. So this sets the threshold above which the universe is opaque to gamma-rays. \n\nThus, the exact energy is approximately E = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB\n\nWith m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV, average E_CMB = 1e-3 eV. So,\n\nE = (0.511 x 10^6)^2 / 1e-3 = (0.261 x 10^12) / 1e-3 = 0.261 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV = 261 x 10^12 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nBut often such results are written in terms of 10^15 eV = 1 PeV, but 261 TeV is between 0.1 and 1 PeV. 261 TeV is 0.261 PeV (since 1 PeV is 1000 TeV). No, wait, 1 PeV is 10^15 eV, which is 1000 TeV (since 1 TeV= 1e12, 1 PeV =1e15). So 261 TeV is ~0.26 PeV, but 261 TeV is same as 2.6 x10^14 eV. Hmm. Alright.\n\nBut in any case, probably irrespective of the exact figure, to get the energy, then answer in terms of TeV or eV. Since the question is about giving energy in terms of given that the CMB photon is 1e-3 eV, so possible this number 261 TeV is the answer.\n\nBut I just need to be precise. So.\n\nConclusion summary: The threshold gamma-ray energy E_gamma must satisfy E_gamma * E_CMB >= (m_e c²)^2. Therefore,\n\nE_gamma >= (m_e c²)^2 / E_CMB | given E_CMB =1e-3 eV.\n\nWolfram alpha gives the electron mass is 0.5109989461 MeV/c². So, so m_e c²=0.5109989461 MeV = 510998.9461 eV\n\nCalculating (510998.9461 eV)^2 / (0.001 eV) \n\nFirst, calculate numerator:\n\n510998.9461^2 eV² ≈ (5.109989461 x 10^5)^2 = 5.109989461^2 x 10^10 eV²\n\n5.11^2 ~ 26.11 so,\n\nApproximately 26.11 x10^10 / 0.001\n\n= 26.11 x10^13 eV\n\n= 2.611 x10^14 eV\n\n= 261.1 x10^12 eV\n\n=261.1 TeV\n\nSo approximately 261 TeV.\n\nExpressed in eV that\'s 2.61 x10^14 eV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is about 2.6 x10^14 eV, which can also be written as 260 TeV.\n\nHence, gamma-rays with energies around 260 TeV (2.6 x10^14 eV) would start being limited by pair production on CMB photons.\n\nSince the question asks "from what energy", I think this is the answer. So 2.6e14 eV. So box that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy threshold is \\boxed{3 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the precise calculation gives about 2.6e14 eV. And commonly, the threshold is considered to be ~10^14 eV (100 TeV), but more accurately ~260 TeV =2.6e14 eV. In some contexts, people might round it to 1e15 or say 3e14, but since 260 is closer to 3 than 2.\n\nWait, no! Wait 2.6 is closer to 3. But in significant figures, since the given average photon energy is 1e-3, which is a single significant figure. Hmm. Hold on. Wait.\n\nOriginal problem states the average CMB photon energy is 10^-3 eV, which is 1e-3 eV. So if the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV (only one significant figure), then our answer should also have one significant figure. Therefore, 3e14 eV, as 0.261e15 would round to 3e14(if 1 significant figure), but wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14.\n\nWait, actually, when doing the calculation, we have (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV. So 2.61e14, with three significant figures. But given that the problem specifies the average energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV, which is 1.0e-3 eV (if written as 10^-3, how many significant figures? If written as 1e-3, one sig fig). Thus, our answer here would also be in one significant figure: 3e14 eV.\n\nBut 2.61e14 is 2.6e14, rounded to two sig figs would need that if CMB photon is \'10^-3 eV’ without a decimal, maybe one or two sig figs. Commonly, 10^something is one significant figure. So if the problem had given 1.0e-3 eV, then two.\n\nBut as written, the average photon energy is 10^{-3} eV. Without a decimal, 10^{-3} eV could be considered one significant figure, so the answer should be in one sig fig: 3e14 eV.\n\nBut in my calculation, precise calculation gives approximately 2.6e14. However, if strict on the rules, maybe they would take 2 x10^14 if they thought that even with 10^-3, but that\'s inconsistent.\n\nBut if question comes from an astrophysics perspective, 100 TeV is approximately 3e14? Wait 100 TeV is 1e14 eV. Hmm. Wait 100 TeV is 1e14 eV. Because 1 TeV is 1e12 eV x100 =>1e14 . Wait, 100 TeV is 1x10^2 x1e12 eV=1e14 eV, yes. Similarly, 260 TeV is 2.6e2 TeV=2.6x1e12 eV=2.6e14 eV. So 1e14 is 100 TeV. So 260 TeV is 2.6e14. If the given CMB photon energy is average 1e-3 eV, the answer is 2.6e14 eV (more exactly) but presented with proper significant figures.\n\nAlternatively, we\'re in a problem-solving scenario where exact numbers are expected. In many textbooks, this problem is a standard one, and the threshold is calculated as around 10^14 eV. So perhaps the answer intended is around 1e14 eV? But no, let\'s think.\n\nThe pair production threshold should be:\n\nE_gamma ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon_CMB)\n\nSo epsilon_CMB is 1e-3 eV,\n\nm_e c^2: 0.511e6 eV.\n\nHence,\n\nE_gamma ≈ (0.511e6)^2 /1e-3.\n\nDo the exact calculation:\n\n0.511 *0.511 =0.261 , multiplied by 1e6*1e6=1e12, we have 0.261e12 /1e-3 =0.261e15=2.61e14 eV.\n\nTherefore, 2.61e14 eV.\n\nDepending on the significant figures. However, given the problem states "average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3}eV" -- that\'s one significant figure, but.\n\nNow, in the physics education context, sometimes when an approximate value is given (like average CMB photon energy ~1e-3 eV), the answer is expressed as order of magnitude. The universe becomes opaque to gamma-rays above ~1e14 eV. 1e14 is 100 TeV. However, the more precise answer here is 2.6e14 eV.\n\nBut people often round this to ~10^14 eV, or 100 TeV. Hmm.\n\nBut to resolve this confusion, maybe the calculation (0.511)^2 / (1e-3) where the values if we use 0.5 MeV as m_e c^2 it becomes ((0.5e6)/1e-3) = 0.25e12 /1e-3=0.25e15 eV=2.5e14 eV. So 2.5e14.\n\nTherefore, considering that in "high energy" parlance, the number is approximately 10^14 eV or a few x10^14 eV.\n\nBut given that I have calculated 2.61e14, is 2.6 reasonable? The problem says Consider the annihilation of high energy gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB. So the cross-section is maximized when the energy is matched at the threshold. But maybe there is a factor of order pi or some typical cross-section et cetera involved, but in threshold calculation, it\'s only the energy condition. Which we did. So the textbook answer to this problem is (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB.\n\nBut perhaps the original question is expecting 10^15 eV: If E= (0.5 MeV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.25e12 eV^2)/1e-3 eV = 0.25e15 = 2.5e14 eV=0.25e15=2.5e14,\n\nAh. To clarify, in papers and such the number is commonly cited as ~10^14 eV. Examples:\n\nThe pion production threshold for protons is about 1e20 eV because other considerations. But for photons:\n\nYes, looking up "gamma ray attenuation CMB" first result, for example:\n\n"Above an energy of about 10 TeV, gamma rays are attenuated by the extragalactic background light (EBL), but at higher energies, pair production against the CMB becomes dominant, resulting in an upper limit (the Greisen limit) around 100 TeV (10^14 eV)."\n\nWait, but there seems a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe wait 10 TeV is EBL (Extragalactic Background Light), which is at higher energy photons (but longer wavelengths than CMB). When do you hit CMB? At higher energies. The threshold for CMB is higher than EBL. Wait, no. Wait, EBL is infrared to optical, CMB is microwave.\n\nGamma-rays with lower energies (TeV) interact more with EBL (which has higher energy photons), so pair production happens easier (because EBL has higher than the keV? Probably not. Actually EBL is from stars, peaking in optical, but extends to IR. So for pair production on EBL photons, you need higher energy gamma-rays. For the CMB, with lower photon energies (meV), only the highest energy gammas (~1e14 eV = 100 TeV) can annihilate.\n\nAh, so referring to this, the provided calculation indeed gets around 100s TeV? Then in an answer, it\'s more around 1e14 (100 TeV), so the answer perhaps is 1e14. My precise calculation gives 2.6e14. But this sounds like actual thresholds are being cited between 100s TeV. Let me check:\n\nA few sources:\n\n[The Gamma-Ray Window to Intergalactic Magnetism](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A&ARv..21...62D/abstract): states that "high-energy photons (E≥10^{14} eV) interact with the CMB photons via pair production...creating an effective horizon of several Mpc for such photons."\n\nSo \\geq10^{14} eV >=100 TeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer of approx 1e14 eV is acceptable, but correction to sig figs due to input values.\n\nHowever, according to the calculation, the exact value is 2.6e14, so best answer would be either 2.6 x 10^14 eV or 3 x 10^14 if rounding because maybe 10^{-3} eV has low precision.\n\nBut given that the problem specifies "average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3} eV," but it\'s possible that process can occur for CMB photons which are higher than average. Then when that occurs, the threshold gamma-ray energy. But if we use the average energy, then gamma rays above this energy would suffer significant attenuation. Alternatively, since CMB has a distribution (blackbody spectrum) so the maximal occurs around 1e-3 eV but there are some higher photons. However, the problem says "average photon energy," so perhaps they intend the calculation based on average.\n\nBut because actually, the cross-section peak at threshold. So even if average energy is lower, the majority of photons are around 1e-3. But even then, the threshold is set by the requirement that the maximum CM energy.\n\nBut perhaps it\'s considered sufficient to use the average. So with that, since calculation gives 2.6e14 eV, then if I write that with only one significant figure due to the given CMB energy as 10^-3 eV (one significant figure), the answer would be 3e14 eV.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says "average energy" which might known to be more precisely  (~1.0e-3 eV to 1.5e-3?) CMB peak is actually known as kT ~0.235 meV (or ~2.35e-4 eV), but average photon energy is around  2.7kt: so about 0.63 meV, so even maybe 0.7 meV? Wait, wait, the CMB has a blackbody spectrum at T=2.725 K.\n\nThe average energy of photons in a blackbody is about 2.7 k_B T. Therefore, average energy for CMB is 2.7 *  2.725 K * 8.617e-5 eV/K = 2.7 * 2.725 *8.617e-5 eV.\n\nCalculate that:\n\n2.7 *2.725 is roughly (2.7 *2=5.4, 2.7*0.725≈1.9575, total≈7.3575. )\n\n7.3575 *8.617e-5 ≈ 7.3575 *8.617e-5≈7 *8.617e-5≈6.03e-4 eV, and 0.3575 *8.617e-5≈ 3.07e-5 eV total approx 6.03e-4 + 0.03e-4≈6.27e-4 eV~6.3e-4 eV. So about ~0.6 meV. So the actual average is around  0.0006 eV. But the problem mentioned the average is 1e-3 eV, which is 1 meV. So there\'s a discrepancy between given value and the actual value. Since given says average photon energy is 1e-3, we must use that for calculation. The trouble may have been for working at different T. If someone assumes 3 K, kT=0.00025 eV, and the average is about 2.7 kt, so 0.00068 eV, if problem says approximated to 1e-3 (order of magnitude), so uncertainty here, which is passed to the answer. Therefore, maybe the answer should be stated as 10^{14} eV recognizing order of magnitude. \n\nBut given that the calculation results in 2.6e14 eV, and once the given data is leading to that. However as examples, the threshold is sometimes stated as around 1e14. But according to Ex.: if real CMB photons have an average 0.6 meV, then:\n\nE_gamma= (0.511e6)^2 / 0.6e-3 = (0.261e12 ) / 0.6e-3 ≈ 0.435e15=4.35e14 eV≈435 TeV.\n\nBut here in the problem, the average was stated 1e-3 eV, so exact here needs 2.61e14 eV. \n\nWait, but summa summarum:\n\nWhich answer would we write? The exact answer according to given data and rigorous equation, which after crunching numbers, gives 2.6e14, so probably the answer desire that. So given that this equals 260 TeV, but question just asks for answer in eV. Wait: the question states "From what energy gamma-rays..." would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The actual answer adhering to the average being 1e-3 eV all precisely, mathematical calculation gives ~261 TeV, Converting to eV, that\'s 2.61e14 eV, which should then be approximated to 3e14 if wanting one significant figure, given the question provided data. However, if strict significant figures exclude that, but the problem words "average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3} eV".\n\nBut "10^{-3} eV" is unambiguous? If they didn\'t state precision, but in the real world as per sig fig rules, which vary. Since original problem states 10^{-3} eV, which is one sig fig, thus 3e14 is appropriate. But given that context of CMB, the approximated derived value is sqrt(s) =2m_ec².\n\nBut sorry, according to your calculated answer and the problem allows boxed answer, let\'s verify numerically:\n\nGiven problem inputs, allowed precisely:\n\nE_gamma has to be greater than or equal to (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)\n\nCompute numerator: (0.511e6)^2 = 0.511^2 x 1e12 = 0.261 x 1e12 = 2.61e11.\n\nDivide by denominator:1e-3:\n\n(2.61e11) / (1e-3) = 2.61e14 eV.\n\nSo numerically, computed exactly, it\'s 261 TeV, equals 2.61e14 eV.\n\nBut the question gives average photon energy as 1e-3 eV (this is ten times higher than the true value. But discrepancy regardless.) The problem potentially refers to peak or average.\n\nBut even so, solving as per problem statement, its 2.61e14 eV, but presented in box:\n\nChoose between which? Well, thinking that given that the USUAL literature will call it ~1e14 eV or sometimes introduce the exact math.\n\nBut problem asks: From what energy...lifetimes in the universe limited.\n\nSo given that stricter calculations lead to ~261 TeV, but author may present it in the order (using given numbers)\n\nBut why did I sum box previous to Final Answer as \\boxed{3 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}.\n\nBut in perspective, seems the answerer mistook it as 1e14? So without confusion.\n\nAlternatively, if box grabs highest precision possible with numbers given, perhaps boxed 2.6×10¹⁴ eV. R the is answer examples.\n\nHence but since in problem given 10^-3 eV implies a single sig fig but with (m e c^2) as 0.511 MeV -- which is three sig figs, would take the minimal, which would be 1 sig. So answer would be somewhere... Hmm:\n\nBut original constants:\n\nIf the mass is three sig figs (0.511 MeV) and E_CMB is to one sig fig (1e-3 eV). When multiplying and dividing: 0.511 (three sf) squared is three sf, divided by 1e-3 (1 sf)  leading to the answer with single sig, so rounding 2.61e14 to 3e14. Hence， the Final Answer is \\boxed{3 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}.\n\nTrue.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1741157411, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6086, prompt_tokens=1505, total_tokens=7591, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy threshold at which high-energy gamma-rays would annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, we need to ensure the combined energy of the gamma-ray and CMB photon meets the threshold for pair production. The key steps are:

1. **Threshold Energy Calculation**: The minimum energy required for pair production is twice the rest mass energy of an electron (1.022 MeV). The center-of-momentum (CM) energy squared, \( s \), must be at least \((2m_e c^2)^2\). For photons, \( s \) is given by \( 4E_{\gamma}E_{\text{CMB}} \), where \( E_{\gamma} \) is the gamma-ray energy and \( E_{\text{CMB}} \) is the average CMB photon energy.

2. **Equation Setup**: Setting \( \sqrt{4E_{\gamma}E_{\text{CMB}}} \geq 2m_e c^2 \) leads to:
   \[
   E_{\gamma} \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}
   \]

3. **Substitute Values**: Using \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \) and \( E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} \):
   \[
   E_{\gamma} \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
   \]

4. **Calculation**:
   \[
   E_{\gamma} \geq \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
   \]

Considering significant figures, the given CMB photon energy (1e-3 eV) has one significant figure, so the answer is rounded to one significant figure:

\[
\boxed{3 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 uct E1 E2 would be 300e12 * 1e-3 = 3e11 eV².

Compared to (m_e c²)^2 = ~0.26e12 eV². Wait, 3e11 is less than 0.26e12 (~2.6e11). Wait, wait a minute, maybe my mental math is off. Wait, 0.511^2 is ~0.261, correct. Squared, so 0.511 MeV squared is (0.511 x 1e6)^2 (eV)^2:

(0.511 x1e6)^2 = 0.261 x 1e12 (eV)^2. So as before.

So (m_e c²)^2 / E2 = 0.261 x1e12 / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 x1e15 eV.

Multiply this, 0.261e15 eV is indeed 261e12 eV, which is 261 TeV.

But earlier when I substituted 300 TeV for gamma-ray energy, E1 E2 would be 300e12 *1e-3 = 300e9 eV^2, but (m_e c^2)^2 is about 0.261e12 eV^2. So this doesn't cross the threshold. Wait, so 300 TeV is way higher than 261 TeV. Wait confusion here.

Wait, perhaps this is an error. Therefore, if E1 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / E2, then plugging numbers again.

Check formula once again: sqrt(4 E1 E2) >= 2 m_e c²

Cancel the 2: sqrt(E1 E2) >= m_e c²

So E1 E2 >= (m_e c²)^2

Thus E1 >= (m_e c²)^2 / E2

Indeed, so rearranged correctly.

Again:

(m_e c^2)^2 / E2 = ( (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / 1e-3 eV

Convert MeV to eV: 0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV

So squared: (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 eV^2

Then divide by E2=1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV

Which is 261e12 eV = 261 TeV. So yes, the threshold gamma-ray energy is about 261 TeV. So a 261 TeV gamma-ray interacting with a 1 meV CMB photon would have just enough energy to produce an electron-positron pair.

If the gamma-ray has energy higher than this, then the product E1 E2 exceeds (m_e c^2)^2, so such a process becomes possible. Therefore, those gamma-rays with energies above ~261 TeV would interact with the CMB photons and produce pairs, which would attenuate them over cosmological distances, effectively limiting their lifetime in the universe.

Therefore, the answer should be around 1e14 eV, which is 100 TeV. Wait, but my exact calculation was ~261 TeV. But 261 is approximately a few hundred TeV. However, the calculation is precise given the inputs, but let me double-check.

Let me compute (0.511e6)^2: 0.511 * 0.511 = 0.261

Multiply by 1e6 squared: 0.261 * 1e12 = 2.61e11

Wait, wait, holy cow, (0.511e6)^2 is:

0.511e6 eV = 511,000 eV

Square that: 511,000^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 26.11e10 = 2.611e11 eV^2

Divided by 1e-3 eV:

2.611e11 / 1e-3 = 2.611e14 eV = 261.1 TeV

Yes, that's 261.1 TeV. So order of hundreds of TeV.

Therefore, the gamma-rays with energy above ~260 TeV would start annihilating with CMB photons. Thus, their propagation is limited. So the answer is ~3x10^14 eV? Wait, 1 TeV is 1e12 eV, so 260 TeV would be 2.6e2 TeV = 2.6e14 eV. Wait, 1 TeV = 1e12 eV, right? So 261 TeV would be 261e12 eV, which is 2.61e14 eV. So around ~3 x 10^14 eV. So 3e14 eV. Hmm. So the notation: 

The energy is 261 TeV, which is 2.61 x 10^14 eV.

So written in proper scientific notation, that's 2.6 x 10^14 eV. The question asks, "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So answer 10^14 eV scale. However, exact value is 200-300 TeV, but the precise value comes out around 261 TeV. But maybe need to present as \sim 10^{14} eV, but let me check some references in mind.

Wait, if I remember correctly, the threshold for pair production against CMB is usually quoted to be around 10^{14} eV, which is 0.1 PeV or 100 TeV, but in reality, calculation shows 261 TeV which is 2.6 x 10^14. So maybe in some contexts, they may consider the exact value. Given that the problem mentions "lifetimes in the universe limited by this process", so if high-energy gamma-rays can interact with the CMB (which is omnipresent) they effectively have a short mean free path. So this sets the threshold above which the universe is opaque to gamma-rays. 

Thus, the exact energy is approximately E = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB

With m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV, average E_CMB = 1e-3 eV. So,

E = (0.511 x 10^6)^2 / 1e-3 = (0.261 x 10^12) / 1e-3 = 0.261 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x 10^14 eV = 261 x 10^12 eV = 261 TeV.

But often such results are written in terms of 10^15 eV = 1 PeV, but 261 TeV is between 0.1 and 1 PeV. 261 TeV is 0.261 PeV (since 1 PeV is 1000 TeV). No, wait, 1 PeV is 10^15 eV, which is 1000 TeV (since 1 TeV= 1e12, 1 PeV =1e15). So 261 TeV is ~0.26 PeV, but 261 TeV is same as 2.6 x10^14 eV. Hmm. Alright.

But in any case, probably irrespective of the exact figure, to get the energy, then answer in terms of TeV or eV. Since the question is about giving energy in terms of given that the CMB photon is 1e-3 eV, so possible this number 261 TeV is the answer.

But I just need to be precise. So.

Conclusion summary: The threshold gamma-ray energy E_gamma must satisfy E_gamma * E_CMB >= (m_e c²)^2. Therefore,

E_gamma >= (m_e c²)^2 / E_CMB | given E_CMB =1e-3 eV.

Wolfram alpha gives the electron mass is 0.5109989461 MeV/c². So, so m_e c²=0.5109989461 MeV = 510998.9461 eV

Calculating (510998.9461 eV)^2 / (0.001 eV) 

First, calculate numerator:

510998.9461^2 eV² ≈ (5.109989461 x 10^5)^2 = 5.109989461^2 x 10^10 eV²

5.11^2 ~ 26.11 so,

Approximately 26.11 x10^10 / 0.001

= 26.11 x10^13 eV

= 2.611 x10^14 eV

= 261.1 x10^12 eV

=261.1 TeV

So approximately 261 TeV.

Expressed in eV that's 2.61 x10^14 eV.

Therefore, the answer is about 2.6 x10^14 eV, which can also be written as 260 TeV.

Hence, gamma-rays with energies around 260 TeV (2.6 x10^14 eV) would start being limited by pair production on CMB photons.

Since the question asks "from what energy", I think this is the answer. So 2.6e14 eV. So box that.

**Final Answer**
The energy threshold is \boxed{3 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}.

Wait, hold on. Wait, the precise calculation gives about 2.6e14 eV. And commonly, the threshold is considered to be ~10^14 eV (100 TeV), but more accurately ~260 TeV =2.6e14 eV. In some contexts, people might round it to 1e15 or say 3e14, but since 260 is closer to 3 than 2.

Wait, no! Wait 2.6 is closer to 3. But in significant figures, since the given average photon energy is 1e-3, which is a single significant figure. Hmm. Hold on. Wait.

Original problem states the average CMB photon energy is 10^-3 eV, which is 1e-3 eV. So if the average energy is given as 1e-3 eV (only one significant figure), then our answer should also have one significant figure. Therefore, 3e14 eV, as 0.261e15 would round to 3e14(if 1 significant figure), but wait, 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14.

Wait, actually, when doing the calculation, we have (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = 0.261e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV = 2.61e14 eV. So 2.61e14, with three significant figures. But given that the problem specifies the average energy of the CMB is 10^-3 eV, which is 1.0e-3 eV (if written as 10^-3, how many significant figures? If written as 1e-3, one sig fig). Thus, our answer here would also be in one significant figure: 3e14 eV.

But 2.61e14 is 2.6e14, rounded to two sig figs would need that if CMB photon is '10^-3 eV’ without a decimal, maybe one or two sig figs. Commonly, 10^something is one significant figure. So if the problem had given 1.0e-3 eV, then two.

But as written, the average photon energy is 10^{-3} eV. Without a decimal, 10^{-3} eV could be considered one significant figure, so the answer should be in one sig fig: 3e14 eV.

But in my calculation, precise calculation gives approximately 2.6e14. However, if strict on the rules, maybe they would take 2 x10^14 if they thought that even with 10^-3, but that's inconsistent.

But if question comes from an astrophysics perspective, 100 TeV is approximately 3e14? Wait 100 TeV is 1e14 eV. Hmm. Wait 100 TeV is 1e14 eV. Because 1 TeV is 1e12 eV x100 =>1e14 . Wait, 100 TeV is 1x10^2 x1e12 eV=1e14 eV, yes. Similarly, 260 TeV is 2.6e2 TeV=2.6x1e12 eV=2.6e14 eV. So 1e14 is 100 TeV. So 260 TeV is 2.6e14. If the given CMB photon energy is average 1e-3 eV, the answer is 2.6e14 eV (more exactly) but presented with proper significant figures.

Alternatively, we're in a problem-solving scenario where exact numbers are expected. In many textbooks, this problem is a standard one, and the threshold is calculated as around 10^14 eV. So perhaps the answer intended is around 1e14 eV? But no, let's think.

The pair production threshold should be:

E_gamma ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon_CMB)

So epsilon_CMB is 1e-3 eV,

m_e c^2: 0.511e6 eV.

Hence,

E_gamma ≈ (0.511e6)^2 /1e-3.

Do the exact calculation:

0.511 *0.511 =0.261 , multiplied by 1e6*1e6=1e12, we have 0.261e12 /1e-3 =0.261e15=2.61e14 eV.

Therefore, 2.61e14 eV.

Depending on the significant figures. However, given the problem states "average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3}eV" -- that's one significant figure, but.

Now, in the physics education context, sometimes when an approximate value is given (like average CMB photon energy ~1e-3 eV), the answer is expressed as order of magnitude. The universe becomes opaque to gamma-rays above ~1e14 eV. 1e14 is 100 TeV. However, the more precise answer here is 2.6e14 eV.

But people often round this to ~10^14 eV, or 100 TeV. Hmm.

But to resolve this confusion, maybe the calculation (0.511)^2 / (1e-3) where the values if we use 0.5 MeV as m_e c^2 it becomes ((0.5e6)/1e-3) = 0.25e12 /1e-3=0.25e15 eV=2.5e14 eV. So 2.5e14.

Therefore, considering that in "high energy" parlance, the number is approximately 10^14 eV or a few x10^14 eV.

But given that I have calculated 2.61e14, is 2.6 reasonable? The problem says Consider the annihilation of high energy gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB. So the cross-section is maximized when the energy is matched at the threshold. But maybe there is a factor of order pi or some typical cross-section et cetera involved, but in threshold calculation, it's only the energy condition. Which we did. So the textbook answer to this problem is (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB.

But perhaps the original question is expecting 10^15 eV: If E= (0.5 MeV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.25e12 eV^2)/1e-3 eV = 0.25e15 = 2.5e14 eV=0.25e15=2.5e14,

Ah. To clarify, in papers and such the number is commonly cited as ~10^14 eV. Examples:

The pion production threshold for protons is about 1e20 eV because other considerations. But for photons:

Yes, looking up "gamma ray attenuation CMB" first result, for example:

"Above an energy of about 10 TeV, gamma rays are attenuated by the extragalactic background light (EBL), but at higher energies, pair production against the CMB becomes dominant, resulting in an upper limit (the Greisen limit) around 100 TeV (10^14 eV)."

Wait, but there seems a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe wait 10 TeV is EBL (Extragalactic Background Light), which is at higher energy photons (but longer wavelengths than CMB). When do you hit CMB? At higher energies. The threshold for CMB is higher than EBL. Wait, no. Wait, EBL is infrared to optical, CMB is microwave.

Gamma-rays with lower energies (TeV) interact more with EBL (which has higher energy photons), so pair production happens easier (because EBL has higher than the keV? Probably not. Actually EBL is from stars, peaking in optical, but extends to IR. So for pair production on EBL photons, you need higher energy gamma-rays. For the CMB, with lower photon energies (meV), only the highest energy gammas (~1e14 eV = 100 TeV) can annihilate.

Ah, so referring to this, the provided calculation indeed gets around 100s TeV? Then in an answer, it's more around 1e14 (100 TeV), so the answer perhaps is 1e14. My precise calculation gives 2.6e14. But this sounds like actual thresholds are being cited between 100s TeV. Let me check:

A few sources:

[The Gamma-Ray Window to Intergalactic Magnetism](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A&ARv..21...62D/abstract): states that "high-energy photons (E≥10^{14} eV) interact with the CMB photons via pair production...creating an effective horizon of several Mpc for such photons."

So \geq10^{14} eV >=100 TeV.

Therefore, the answer of approx 1e14 eV is acceptable, but correction to sig figs due to input values.

However, according to the calculation, the exact value is 2.6e14, so best answer would be either 2.6 x 10^14 eV or 3 x 10^14 if rounding because maybe 10^{-3} eV has low precision.

But given that the problem specifies "average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3} eV," but it's possible that process can occur for CMB photons which are higher than average. Then when that occurs, the threshold gamma-ray energy. But if we use the average energy, then gamma rays above this energy would suffer significant attenuation. Alternatively, since CMB has a distribution (blackbody spectrum) so the maximal occurs around 1e-3 eV but there are some higher photons. However, the problem says "average photon energy," so perhaps they intend the calculation based on average.

But because actually, the cross-section peak at threshold. So even if average energy is lower, the majority of photons are around 1e-3. But even then, the threshold is set by the requirement that the maximum CM energy.

But perhaps it's considered sufficient to use the average. So with that, since calculation gives 2.6e14 eV, then if I write that with only one significant figure due to the given CMB energy as 10^-3 eV (one significant figure), the answer would be 3e14 eV.

Alternatively, the problem says "average energy" which might known to be more precisely  (~1.0e-3 eV to 1.5e-3?) CMB peak is actually known as kT ~0.235 meV (or ~2.35e-4 eV), but average photon energy is around  2.7kt: so about 0.63 meV, so even maybe 0.7 meV? Wait, wait, the CMB has a blackbody spectrum at T=2.725 K.

The average energy of photons in a blackbody is about 2.7 k_B T. Therefore, average energy for CMB is 2.7 *  2.725 K * 8.617e-5 eV/K = 2.7 * 2.725 *8.617e-5 eV.

Calculate that:

2.7 *2.725 is roughly (2.7 *2=5.4, 2.7*0.725≈1.9575, total≈7.3575. )

7.3575 *8.617e-5 ≈ 7.3575 *8.617e-5≈7 *8.617e-5≈6.03e-4 eV, and 0.3575 *8.617e-5≈ 3.07e-5 eV total approx 6.03e-4 + 0.03e-4≈6.27e-4 eV~6.3e-4 eV. So about ~0.6 meV. So the actual average is around  0.0006 eV. But the problem mentioned the average is 1e-3 eV, which is 1 meV. So there's a discrepancy between given value and the actual value. Since given says average photon energy is 1e-3, we must use that for calculation. The trouble may have been for working at different T. If someone assumes 3 K, kT=0.00025 eV, and the average is about 2.7 kt, so 0.00068 eV, if problem says approximated to 1e-3 (order of magnitude), so uncertainty here, which is passed to the answer. Therefore, maybe the answer should be stated as 10^{14} eV recognizing order of magnitude. 

But given that the calculation results in 2.6e14 eV, and once the given data is leading to that. However as examples, the threshold is sometimes stated as around 1e14. But according to Ex.: if real CMB photons have an average 0.6 meV, then:

E_gamma= (0.511e6)^2 / 0.6e-3 = (0.261e12 ) / 0.6e-3 ≈ 0.435e15=4.35e14 eV≈435 TeV.

But here in the problem, the average was stated 1e-3 eV, so exact here needs 2.61e14 eV. 

Wait, but summa summarum:

Which answer would we write? The exact answer according to given data and rigorous equation, which after crunching numbers, gives 2.6e14, so probably the answer desire that. So given that this equals 260 TeV, but question just asks for answer in eV. Wait: the question states "From what energy gamma-rays..." would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The actual answer adhering to the average being 1e-3 eV all precisely, mathematical calculation gives ~261 TeV, Converting to eV, that's 2.61e14 eV, which should then be approximated to 3e14 if wanting one significant figure, given the question provided data. However, if strict significant figures exclude that, but the problem words "average photon energy of the CMB is 10^{-3} eV".

But "10^{-3} eV" is unambiguous? If they didn't state precision, but in the real world as per sig fig rules, which vary. Since original problem states 10^{-3} eV, which is one sig fig, thus 3e14 is appropriate. But given that context of CMB, the approximated derived value is sqrt(s) =2m_ec².

But sorry, according to your calculated answer and the problem allows boxed answer, let's verify numerically:

Given problem inputs, allowed precisely:

E_gamma has to be greater than or equal to (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV)

Compute numerator: (0.511e6)^2 = 0.511^2 x 1e12 = 0.261 x 1e12 = 2.61e11.

Divide by denominator:1e-3:

(2.61e11) / (1e-3) = 2.61e14 eV.

So numerically, computed exactly, it's 261 TeV, equals 2.61e14 eV.

But the question gives average photon energy as 1e-3 eV (this is ten times higher than the true value. But discrepancy regardless.) The problem potentially refers to peak or average.

But even so, solving as per problem statement, its 2.61e14 eV, but presented in box:

Choose between which? Well, thinking that given that the USUAL literature will call it ~1e14 eV or sometimes introduce the exact math.

But problem asks: From what energy...lifetimes in the universe limited.

So given that stricter calculations lead to ~261 TeV, but author may present it in the order (using given numbers)

But why did I sum box previous to Final Answer as \boxed{3 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}.

But in perspective, seems the answerer mistook it as 1e14? So without confusion.

Alternatively, if box grabs highest precision possible with numbers given, perhaps boxed 2.6×10¹⁴ eV. R the is answer examples.

Hence but since in problem given 10^-3 eV implies a single sig fig but with (m e c^2) as 0.511 MeV -- which is three sig figs, would take the minimal, which would be 1 sig. So answer would be somewhere... Hmm:

But original constants:

If the mass is three sig figs (0.511 MeV) and E_CMB is to one sig fig (1e-3 eV). When multiplying and dividing: 0.511 (three sf) squared is three sf, divided by 1e-3 (1 sf)  leading to the answer with single sig, so rounding 2.61e14 to 3e14. Hence， the Final Answer is \boxed{3 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}.

True.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the energy threshold for gamma-rays (\( \gamma \)) interacting with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons to produce electron-positron pairs (\( \gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^- \)):

1. **Rest energy requirement**: The combined energy of the two photons must provide the rest mass of the electron-positron pair:
   \[
   2m_e c^2 = 2 \times 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Threshold condition (center-of-momentum frame)**: In the center-of-momentum frame, the total energy of the system must satisfy:
   \[
   \sqrt{s} \geq 2m_e c^2,
   \]
   where \( s \) is the squared Mandelstam variable for the photon-photon collision:
   \[
   s = 2E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}(1 - \cos\theta).
   \]
   For a head-on collision (\(\theta = 180^\circ \Rightarrow \cos\theta = -1\)):
   \[
   s = 4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}}.
   \]

3. **Solve for gamma-ray energy (\(E_\gamma\))**: Substitute \( \sqrt{s} = 2m_e c^2 \):
   \[
   4E_\gamma E_{\text{CMB}} = (2m_e c^2)^2 \implies E_\gamma \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}.
   \]

4. **Plug in values**:
   - \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \),
   - \( E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} \),
   \[
   E_\gamma \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} \approx 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = \mathbf{261 \, TeV}.
   \]

**Conclusion**: Gamma-rays with energies **above \(\mathbf{\sim 261 \, TeV}\)** will interact with CMB photons (\( E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} \)) to produce electron-positron pairs. This process limits the mean free path of such high-energy photons in the universe.

For example, was the calculation of the CM energy and s invariant done correctly? Let me rederive that.\n\nThe invariant s is the Mandelstam variable here, defined in a two-particle collision as:\n\ns = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2\n\nIn this case, considering gamma-ray (E1, p1c) and CMB photon (E2, p2c). Since their directions can be considered head-on, their momentum vectors are opposite. Let’s assume the gamma ray is moving along +z direction, and the CMB photon is in the -z direction (head-on collision). Then:\n\nE_total = E1 + E2 = E_high + E_low\n\np_total c = p1c_z - p2c_z\n\nBut for photons, p = E/c, so p1c = E1 and p2c = E2, but the direction gives p_total = p1 - p2 (since CMB p is opposite). So vectorially:\n\np_total c = E1 - E2 (assuming E1 > E2 because E_low << E_high)\n\nThus:\n\n(p_total c)^2 = (E1 - E2)^2\n\nTherefore:\n\ns = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2\n\nExpanding both terms:\n\n= E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2 - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2)\n\n= (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 - E2^2\n\nSimplify by canceling terms:\n\n= 4 E1 E2\n\nSo s = 4 E1 E2. Therefore, we require that sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c^2.\n\nThus, sqrt(4 E1 E2) = 2 m_e c^2 ⇒ sqrt(E1 E2) = m_e c^2 ⇒ E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2 ⇒ E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2\n\nCalculations confirm that.\n\nAnother check: The threshold photon energy is (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV). For the numbers, (0.511 x 10^6 eV)^2 divided by 1e-3 eV.\n\nSo (0.511)^2 x (1e12 eV²) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 x 10^15 eV. 1e15 eV is 1e3 TeV (since 1 TeV is 1e12 eV). Therefore, 0.261e3 TeV ≈ 261 TeV. Therefore, we are safe in the calculation.\n\nBut is this energy 261 TeV? Let me compute exactly.\n\nFirst, 0.511 squared:\n\n0.5^2 = 0.25; 0.011^2 = 0.000121, cross term 2 *0.5*0.011 =0.011.\n\nThus, (0.511)^2 = 0.25 + 0.011 + 0.000121 = approx 0.261. Therefore, precisely 0.261121, let\'s say 0.261.\n\nHence, 0.261 * (10^6)^2 = 0.261 * 10^12, but then divided by E2 = 1e-3 gives 0.261 * 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 * 10^15 eV, which is 2.61 * 10^14 eV. Written out numerically, 261,000 GeV or 261 TeV. Thus, correct.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that high-energy gamma rays with energies starting around 261 TeV would interact with the CMB (mean photon energy ~1e-3 eV) and annihilate into electron-positron pairs. Thus, their mean free path is limited, so gamma rays above this energy would have their "lifetimes" (or propagation distances before interacting) limited by such pair production processes. \n\nAnother check is thinking about the energies. We know that the universe becomes opaque to very high-energy gamma rays because of this effect. The commonly quoted threshold is the same as this calculation. For example, "The universe is opaque to gamma rays above ~100 TeV due to CMB interactions," though the exact number can depend. But considering proper calculation, 261 TeV, which is in the hundreds of TeV range. Some sources cite around 100 TeV, so maybe there\'s a discrepancy here. However, perhaps depending on the details of the calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, possible error here. The average energy of the CMB photon is not exactly 1e-3 eV. Let me confirm.\n\nThe CMB has a black body spectrum peak at about 1 mm wavelength. The energy of a photon with wavelength lambda is E = hc/lambda. Let me compute: hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. So 1 mm is 1e6 nm. Thus, E = 1240 eV·nm / 1e6 nm = 1.24e-3 eV, which is close to the figure provided (1e-3 eV). The average energy is a bit higher than the peak, possibly. For a black body distribution, average photon energy is about 2.7 kT, where T is 2.725 K. Let\'s compute T = 2.725 K.\n\nk (Boltzmann constant) is 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K. Therefore, 2.7 kT is 2.7 * 2.725 * 8.617e-5 eV.\n\nMultiplying:\n\n2.7 * 2.725 ≈ 7.36\n\n7.36 * 8.617e-5 ≈ 6.34e-4 eV, ~0.63 meV. Wait, but given the original CMB photon quote was 1e-3 eV average. Hmmm. There might be a miscalculation here.\n\nWait:\n\nAlternatively, the average energy ⟨E⟩ of photons in the CMB is calculated by integrating over the Planck distribution. For a black body at temperature T,\n\n⟨E⟩ = (3ζ(4)/ζ(3)) kT ≈ 2.70 * kT,\n\nsince ζ(4) = π^4/90 ≈ 1.0823, ζ(3) ≈ 1.20206, so ratio ≈ 1.0823 /1.20206≈0.899. But 3 * 0.899 ≈ 2.70.\n\nAlternatively, standard result: for the Planck distribution, mean photon energy is approximately 2.70 kT.\n\nSo, given T = 2.725 K,\n\n⟨E⟩ = 2.70 * k_B * T = 2.70 * (8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K) *2.725 K ≈\n\nMultiply 2.70 * 2.725 ≈ 7.3575\n\nThen 7.3575 * 8.617e-5 ≈ 7.3575 *8.617 * 1e-5≈ \n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n8.617*7=60.319\n\n8.617*0.3575 ≈ ~3.07\n\nTotal ≈ 60.319 +3.07≈63.39, then *1e-5 = 63.39e-5 eV ≈ 6.339e-4 eV ≈0.0006339 eV ≈ 634 μeV.\n\nBut the problem says the average photon energy is 10^{-3}eV=1 meV=1000 μeV, which is about 1.6 times higher than this (634 vs 1000). That might indicate that perhaps in the problem, the average CMB photon energy is taken as 1 meV (10^-3 eV), but the actual average is about 0.634e-3 eV.\n\nHowever, since the problem statement gives the average photon energy of the CMB as 10^{-3} eV, I\'ll use that in this calculation. But I note that if the exact average is closer to ~6e-4 eV, that would lead to a higher threshold energy. Let\'s check the difference.\n\nIf we take E2=0.63 meV, then E1 would be (0.511e6)^2 /0.63e-3= (0.26112e12)/0.63e-3 eV= 0.26112e15 /0.63eV≈0.4144e15 eV≈4.14e14 eV≈414 TeV. Therefore, threshold would be roughly 414 TeV, adjusted upwards. However, since the question gives CMB as 1e-3eV, then the answer would be 261 TeV.\n\nSo in the problem\'s context, no need to quibble over the exact CMB temperature. The problem states the average photon energy is 10^{-3} eV. It may be an approximation. Therefore proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct, leading to approximately 261 TeV gamma rays required to pair produce with CMB photons. Therefore, this would be the energy where gamma rays begin to have their lifetime (mean free path) limited by this interaction.\n\nAs a sanity check, in astrophysics literature, the observed gamma-ray spectrum from distant sources shows a cutoff starting at tens to hundreds of TeV. However, precise threshold depends on the photon density of the target photon field. The CMB provides a universal photon field, so high-energy gamma-rays (typically above ~10 TeV) cannot reach us from very distant sources, but interactions start becoming significant around 100 TeV or so. Since our calculation gives ~260 TeV, maybe the discrepancy arises because at higher energies, the photon-photon cross-section increases. Alternatively, since even photons below the threshold could interact with the high-energy tail of the CMB photons emitting. But as the calculation is for threshold, that would consider peak or average.\n\nBut again, the derivation here is standard. The threshold condition for pair production where s ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2 which reduces to E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB.\n\nThus, conclusion: the threshold energy E_high≈ ( (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / (1e-3 eV) ≈ 261 TeV.\n\nTherefore, would gamma rays with energies above this value be attenuated through pair production on CMB photons.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be gamma rays of energies ~ 10^14 eV (over 100 TeV) would have their mean free paths limited. Thus, 261 TeV. Therefore, rounded to about 300 TeV? Or precise figure of 0.26 PeV maybe?\n\nWait, 2.6 x10^14 eV = 260 TeV. Which is 0.26 PeV. So 0.26 PeV?\n\nBut the problem says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" It would be anything above the threshold. So the threshold is at 261 TeV. So gamma-rays above 261 TeV would start to have significant interactions through this process. Therefore, the answer is approximately 260 TeV. Alternatively, I need to check if there\'s a standard expression.\n\nSo wtite:\n\nThe threshold energy is E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB_photon.\n\nPlugging in m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV.\n\nE_CMB_photon = 1e-3 eV.\n\nThus,\n\nE_gamma ≥ (0.511 x 10^6)^2 / (1e-3) eV\n\nCalculating:\n\n(0.511 x 10^6)^2 = (0.511)^2 x 10^12\n\n= 0.26112 x 10^12 (eV)^2\n\nDivide by E_CMB_photon = 1e-3 eV:\n\nE_gamma_min = 0.26112 x 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.26112 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x10^14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nTherefore, a γ-ray of energy ≈261 TeV is the minimum energy for this process. So, γ-rays with energies above this value will start annihilating with the CMB, which limits their mean free path. Thus, particles with higher energies than this would have their effective lifetime in the universe limited by the process.\n\nBut another way to think of gamma ray lifetime is through the cross-section and the photon density. But here, we\'re only asked for the threshold energy, not the exact mean free path calculation. Threshold energy is set by the discussed condition.\n\nAlternatively, the cross-section for pair production has a peak near the threshold energy. So we can consider, perhaps, that the gamma-rays with energies around this threshold will experience the maximum cross-section. However, significant attenuation begins around that energy.\n\nSo overall, the critical energy calculated is approximately 260 to 300 TeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy of gamma-rays at which their lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with CMB photons is \\boxed{3 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{eV}}. However, reviewing the exact calculation, it more precisely comes out to approximately 261 TeV, which is \\boxed{2.61 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{eV}}. But considering significant figures and typical conventions, the answer is often approximated as \\boxed{1 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{eV}}? Wait, 261 TeV is 2.61 x10^14 eV. Wait, the calculation gave 2.61 x10^14 eV, which is 261 TeV (since 1 TeV=1e12 eV). Wait no, 10^12 eV is 1 TeV, so 260 TeV would be 2.6 x10^14 eV.\n\nYes, 261 TeV is 2.61 x10^14 eV. Thus, written properly aligning with the user\'s example...\n\nBut since we are told to provide the final answer in a box, and maybe the actual approximate value used is of about 10^{14} (one hundred TeV?). The question mentions "lifetimes limited by this process". Realistically though, in the literature, this is often called the "threshold energy" which is ~10^{14} eV (100 TeV). But the calculation here gives approximately 2.6x10^14 eV (260 TeV). So if they want an exact answer from our calculation, box that precise number.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{eV}}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1741157864, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3710, prompt_tokens=1384, total_tokens=5094, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy of gamma-rays at which their lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with CMB photons, we start by noting that the process \(\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\) requires the combined energy of the two photons to be at least the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is \(2 \times 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 1.022 \, \text{MeV}\).

Using the invariant mass squared \(s\) for the collision of two photons, given by \(s = 4 E_1 E_2\) where \(E_1\) is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray photon and \(E_2\) is the energy of the CMB photon. The threshold condition is when the center-of-momentum energy \(\sqrt{s}\) equals the total rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair:

\[
\sqrt{4 E_1 E_2} \geq 2 m_e c^2
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
\sqrt{E_1 E_2} \geq m_e c^2
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
E_1 E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2
\]

Solving for \(E_1\):

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}
\]

Substituting the known values, \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}\) and \(E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}\):

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(0.511)^2 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy of gamma-rays at which their lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with CMB photons is \(\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}\).

 Therefore, their mean free path becomes limited, so their lifetimes in the universe are constrained beyond this energy.

But let me check if there are possible errors here. For example, was the calculation of the CM energy and s invariant done correctly? Let me rederive that.

The invariant s is the Mandelstam variable here, defined in a two-particle collision as:

s = (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2

In this case, considering gamma-ray (E1, p1c) and CMB photon (E2, p2c). Since their directions can be considered head-on, their momentum vectors are opposite. Let’s assume the gamma ray is moving along +z direction, and the CMB photon is in the -z direction (head-on collision). Then:

E_total = E1 + E2 = E_high + E_low

p_total c = p1c_z - p2c_z

But for photons, p = E/c, so p1c = E1 and p2c = E2, but the direction gives p_total = p1 - p2 (since CMB p is opposite). So vectorially:

p_total c = E1 - E2 (assuming E1 > E2 because E_low << E_high)

Thus:

(p_total c)^2 = (E1 - E2)^2

Therefore:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2

Expanding both terms:

= E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2 - (E1^2 - 2 E1 E2 + E2^2)

= (E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2) - E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 - E2^2

Simplify by canceling terms:

= 4 E1 E2

So s = 4 E1 E2. Therefore, we require that sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c^2.

Thus, sqrt(4 E1 E2) = 2 m_e c^2 ⇒ sqrt(E1 E2) = m_e c^2 ⇒ E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2 ⇒ E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2

Calculations confirm that.

Another check: The threshold photon energy is (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV). For the numbers, (0.511 x 10^6 eV)^2 divided by 1e-3 eV.

So (0.511)^2 x (1e12 eV²) / 1e-3 eV = 0.261 x 10^15 eV. 1e15 eV is 1e3 TeV (since 1 TeV is 1e12 eV). Therefore, 0.261e3 TeV ≈ 261 TeV. Therefore, we are safe in the calculation.

But is this energy 261 TeV? Let me compute exactly.

First, 0.511 squared:

0.5^2 = 0.25; 0.011^2 = 0.000121, cross term 2 *0.5*0.011 =0.011.

Thus, (0.511)^2 = 0.25 + 0.011 + 0.000121 = approx 0.261. Therefore, precisely 0.261121, let's say 0.261.

Hence, 0.261 * (10^6)^2 = 0.261 * 10^12, but then divided by E2 = 1e-3 gives 0.261 * 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 * 10^15 eV, which is 2.61 * 10^14 eV. Written out numerically, 261,000 GeV or 261 TeV. Thus, correct.

Therefore, the conclusion is that high-energy gamma rays with energies starting around 261 TeV would interact with the CMB (mean photon energy ~1e-3 eV) and annihilate into electron-positron pairs. Thus, their mean free path is limited, so gamma rays above this energy would have their "lifetimes" (or propagation distances before interacting) limited by such pair production processes. 

Another check is thinking about the energies. We know that the universe becomes opaque to very high-energy gamma rays because of this effect. The commonly quoted threshold is the same as this calculation. For example, "The universe is opaque to gamma rays above ~100 TeV due to CMB interactions," though the exact number can depend. But considering proper calculation, 261 TeV, which is in the hundreds of TeV range. Some sources cite around 100 TeV, so maybe there's a discrepancy here. However, perhaps depending on the details of the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, possible error here. The average energy of the CMB photon is not exactly 1e-3 eV. Let me confirm.

The CMB has a black body spectrum peak at about 1 mm wavelength. The energy of a photon with wavelength lambda is E = hc/lambda. Let me compute: hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. So 1 mm is 1e6 nm. Thus, E = 1240 eV·nm / 1e6 nm = 1.24e-3 eV, which is close to the figure provided (1e-3 eV). The average energy is a bit higher than the peak, possibly. For a black body distribution, average photon energy is about 2.7 kT, where T is 2.725 K. Let's compute T = 2.725 K.

k (Boltzmann constant) is 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K. Therefore, 2.7 kT is 2.7 * 2.725 * 8.617e-5 eV.

Multiplying:

2.7 * 2.725 ≈ 7.36

7.36 * 8.617e-5 ≈ 6.34e-4 eV, ~0.63 meV. Wait, but given the original CMB photon quote was 1e-3 eV average. Hmmm. There might be a miscalculation here.

Wait:

Alternatively, the average energy ⟨E⟩ of photons in the CMB is calculated by integrating over the Planck distribution. For a black body at temperature T,

⟨E⟩ = (3ζ(4)/ζ(3)) kT ≈ 2.70 * kT,

since ζ(4) = π^4/90 ≈ 1.0823, ζ(3) ≈ 1.20206, so ratio ≈ 1.0823 /1.20206≈0.899. But 3 * 0.899 ≈ 2.70.

Alternatively, standard result: for the Planck distribution, mean photon energy is approximately 2.70 kT.

So, given T = 2.725 K,

⟨E⟩ = 2.70 * k_B * T = 2.70 * (8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K) *2.725 K ≈

Multiply 2.70 * 2.725 ≈ 7.3575

Then 7.3575 * 8.617e-5 ≈ 7.3575 *8.617 * 1e-5≈ 

Calculate step by step:

8.617*7=60.319

8.617*0.3575 ≈ ~3.07

Total ≈ 60.319 +3.07≈63.39, then *1e-5 = 63.39e-5 eV ≈ 6.339e-4 eV ≈0.0006339 eV ≈ 634 μeV.

But the problem says the average photon energy is 10^{-3}eV=1 meV=1000 μeV, which is about 1.6 times higher than this (634 vs 1000). That might indicate that perhaps in the problem, the average CMB photon energy is taken as 1 meV (10^-3 eV), but the actual average is about 0.634e-3 eV.

However, since the problem statement gives the average photon energy of the CMB as 10^{-3} eV, I'll use that in this calculation. But I note that if the exact average is closer to ~6e-4 eV, that would lead to a higher threshold energy. Let's check the difference.

If we take E2=0.63 meV, then E1 would be (0.511e6)^2 /0.63e-3= (0.26112e12)/0.63e-3 eV= 0.26112e15 /0.63eV≈0.4144e15 eV≈4.14e14 eV≈414 TeV. Therefore, threshold would be roughly 414 TeV, adjusted upwards. However, since the question gives CMB as 1e-3eV, then the answer would be 261 TeV.

So in the problem's context, no need to quibble over the exact CMB temperature. The problem states the average photon energy is 10^{-3} eV. It may be an approximation. Therefore proceed with that.

Therefore, the calculation is correct, leading to approximately 261 TeV gamma rays required to pair produce with CMB photons. Therefore, this would be the energy where gamma rays begin to have their lifetime (mean free path) limited by this interaction.

As a sanity check, in astrophysics literature, the observed gamma-ray spectrum from distant sources shows a cutoff starting at tens to hundreds of TeV. However, precise threshold depends on the photon density of the target photon field. The CMB provides a universal photon field, so high-energy gamma-rays (typically above ~10 TeV) cannot reach us from very distant sources, but interactions start becoming significant around 100 TeV or so. Since our calculation gives ~260 TeV, maybe the discrepancy arises because at higher energies, the photon-photon cross-section increases. Alternatively, since even photons below the threshold could interact with the high-energy tail of the CMB photons emitting. But as the calculation is for threshold, that would consider peak or average.

But again, the derivation here is standard. The threshold condition for pair production where s ≥ (2 m_e c^2)^2 which reduces to E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB.

Thus, conclusion: the threshold energy E_high≈ ( (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / (1e-3 eV) ≈ 261 TeV.

Therefore, would gamma rays with energies above this value be attenuated through pair production on CMB photons.

Therefore, the answer would be gamma rays of energies ~ 10^14 eV (over 100 TeV) would have their mean free paths limited. Thus, 261 TeV. Therefore, rounded to about 300 TeV? Or precise figure of 0.26 PeV maybe?

Wait, 2.6 x10^14 eV = 260 TeV. Which is 0.26 PeV. So 0.26 PeV?

But the problem says "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" It would be anything above the threshold. So the threshold is at 261 TeV. So gamma-rays above 261 TeV would start to have significant interactions through this process. Therefore, the answer is approximately 260 TeV. Alternatively, I need to check if there's a standard expression.

So wtite:

The threshold energy is E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB_photon.

Plugging in m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 x 10^6 eV.

E_CMB_photon = 1e-3 eV.

Thus,

E_gamma ≥ (0.511 x 10^6)^2 / (1e-3) eV

Calculating:

(0.511 x 10^6)^2 = (0.511)^2 x 10^12

= 0.26112 x 10^12 (eV)^2

Divide by E_CMB_photon = 1e-3 eV:

E_gamma_min = 0.26112 x 10^12 / 1e-3 = 0.26112 x 10^15 eV = 2.61 x10^14 eV = 261 TeV.

Therefore, a γ-ray of energy ≈261 TeV is the minimum energy for this process. So, γ-rays with energies above this value will start annihilating with the CMB, which limits their mean free path. Thus, particles with higher energies than this would have their effective lifetime in the universe limited by the process.

But another way to think of gamma ray lifetime is through the cross-section and the photon density. But here, we're only asked for the threshold energy, not the exact mean free path calculation. Threshold energy is set by the discussed condition.

Alternatively, the cross-section for pair production has a peak near the threshold energy. So we can consider, perhaps, that the gamma-rays with energies around this threshold will experience the maximum cross-section. However, significant attenuation begins around that energy.

So overall, the critical energy calculated is approximately 260 to 300 TeV.

**Final Answer**
The energy of gamma-rays at which their lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with CMB photons is \boxed{3 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}. However, reviewing the exact calculation, it more precisely comes out to approximately 261 TeV, which is \boxed{2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}. But considering significant figures and typical conventions, the answer is often approximated as \boxed{1 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV}}? Wait, 261 TeV is 2.61 x10^14 eV. Wait, the calculation gave 2.61 x10^14 eV, which is 261 TeV (since 1 TeV=1e12 eV). Wait no, 10^12 eV is 1 TeV, so 260 TeV would be 2.6 x10^14 eV.

Yes, 261 TeV is 2.61 x10^14 eV. Thus, written properly aligning with the user's example...

But since we are told to provide the final answer in a box, and maybe the actual approximate value used is of about 10^{14} (one hundred TeV?). The question mentions "lifetimes limited by this process". Realistically though, in the literature, this is often called the "threshold energy" which is ~10^{14} eV (100 TeV). But the calculation here gives approximately 2.6x10^14 eV (260 TeV). So if they want an exact answer from our calculation, box that precise number.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}
