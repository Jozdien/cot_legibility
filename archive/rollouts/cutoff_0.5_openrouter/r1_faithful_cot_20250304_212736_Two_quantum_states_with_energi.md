To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

where \(\hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}\).

For the first state with lifetime \(\tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s}\):

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the second state with lifetime \(\tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s}\):

\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

The total uncertainty (sum of the individual uncertainties) is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between them should be significantly larger than this total uncertainty. The energy difference should be on the order of \(10^{-6} \, \text{eV}\) to ensure clear resolution.

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy difference between two quantum states that allows them to be clearly resolved. The lifetimes given are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates lifetime to energy uncertainty. Let me think. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is on the order of Planck's constant divided by 2π. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, more precisely, the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime τ (tau) by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. That's because the lifetime of a state is connected to the spread in energy, right?

So each energy level isn't perfectly sharp; instead, they have a natural linewidth due to their finite lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than their combined uncertainties, then they can be clearly resolved. Otherwise, if the energy difference is on the order of or smaller than the uncertainties, the peaks in the spectrum would overlap too much, and they wouldn't be distinguishable.

First, let me calculate the energy uncertainty for each state. The first state has a lifetime τ1 = 10^-9 seconds. So, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, for the second state with τ2 = 10^-8 seconds, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. What is the value of ħ? Let me recall. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, so ħ = h/(2π) is about 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s.

Calculating ΔE1: ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J. Similarly, ΔE2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J.

But energy in quantum mechanics, especially for transitions, is often expressed in electron volts (eV). Let me convert these values to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J. So, divide by that conversion factor.

For ΔE1: 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. And ΔE2: 1.0545718e-26 J / 1.602176634e-19 = 6.58e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainties are approximately 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for states 1 and 2, respectively.

Now, the combined uncertainty. When distinguishing two peaks, the total linewidth would be the sum of the individual linewidths? Or maybe the FWHM (full width at half maximum) adds in quadrature? Hmm. Actually, for two Lorentzian peaks (which is the lineshape from exponential decay), the convolution would lead to a total linewidth being the sum of the individual linewidths. So that ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So adding those two uncertainties gives ΔE_total ≈ 6.58e-7 eV + 6.58e-8 eV = 7.24e-7 eV approximately.

Now, to resolve two spectral lines, the energy difference between them should be much larger than the total linewidth. There's a criterion called the Rayleigh criterion which in optics states that two peaks are resolved when the peak separation is greater than or equal to the sum of their full width at half maximum (FWHM) values. So applying a similar logic here, the energy difference ΔE between the two states should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties.

Thus, ΔE_21 = |E2 - E1| > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) ≈ 7e-7 eV. Therefore, the energy difference should be significantly larger than 7.24e-7 eV. So the answer would need to be an energy difference larger than that. Let me check the options. Wait, the problem is multiple choice and they give options. Wait, the user hasn't listed the options here. Oh, wait, the question is part of a generated prompt where the options are expected to be presented, but in the user's initial message, the problem is written as:

"Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?"

But then, the user pasted the problem here as a quote and starts the assistant's thought process. Probably, in the actual scenario, the user would provide options, but since the problem isn't complete here, maybe the options are standard? Wait, maybe the response is supposed to result in a difference much larger than ~10^-6 eV? Let me think. Maybe when units differ. But wait, problem is in terms of what the actual options could be... Since I don't have access to the specific options, but perhaps this is a typical problem sometimes, so maybe standard calculation leads to certain value. But the uncertainty sum is about ~7e-7 eV. To clearly resolve, probably the energy difference should be greater than this. So, as per standard, the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the two linewidths.

So let me verify my calculations again.

First, converting τ to ΔE:

Using ΔE = ħ / τ. So let's compute in eV·s.

ħ in eV·s is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Therefore, for τ1 =1e-9 s: ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV

For τ2=1e-8 s: ΔE2 =6.582e-16 /1e-8 =6.582e-8 eV

So total delta E is roughly 6.582e-7 +6.582e-8= approx 7.24e-7 eV

Therefore, the necessary separation is about E2-E1 >>7.24e-7 eV.

Thus, the energy difference should be larger than roughly 10^-6 eV, maybe an order of magnitude higher, like 10^-5 eV? If the options include something like 10^-5 eV, that would be good. But since the problem says "could be their energy difference", so maybe's giving options in terms like 1e-6, 1e-7, 1e-8, etc. A standard question like this wants the energy difference greater than the sum of the linewidths. So, for example, if one of the options is 10^-6 eV which is 1e-6 eV, that's larger than 7.24e-7 eV ≈0.7e-6 so 1e-6 is okay. Alternatively, 10^-5 better. But given that maybe the estimate is of the same order, so required about 7e-7 to resolve, positions that the option the teacher wants here may be 1e-6 eV, as typical answer. However, since the user hasn't given options, but based on our calculation, the energy difference should be at least ~1e-6 eV. Therefore, answer is likely to be in the ~10^-6 eV level.

Wait, so in summary, the linewidths are ~1e-7 and ~1e-6?

Wait, wait! Wait, tau1: 1e-9 using deltaE= hbar/tau.

Wait for ħ in eV·s, I think, ħ is 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So for tau1=1e-9s: ΔE1=6.58e-16 /1e-9=6.58e-7 eV≈0.658e-6 eV.

Similarly, for tau2=1e-8 s:DELTA e2=6.58e-16 /1e-8=6.58e-8 eV≈6.58e-8 eV≈0.0658e-6 eV.

So the sum is 0.658e-6 + 0.0658e-6 ≈0.724e-6≈7.24e-7 eV≈≈7e-7.

So E2-E1 should be much larger than 7e-7 eV.

Therefore, the minimal energy difference should be around that value. So if in the options you have 1e-6 eV (1 microelectronvolt), that would be resolvable. If you have 1e-8 eV, that's too small. 1e-5? 1e-5 eV=0.01 meV which is reasonable.

Wait, but lack of options unclear. However, the conclusion we arrived at is that to resolve them clearly, the energy difference should be greater than the combined linewidth, which is approximately 7.2e-7 eV≈0.72 µeV. Therefore, their energy difference should be larger than about 1 µeV. Thus, the correct answer from the options would be the one bigger than 1 µeV, likely 1e-6 eV.

Given that, standard multiple-choice options can include 10^-4 eV, 10^-5, 10^-6, 10^-7. Pick the one above 7e-7, which is 1e-6. Additionally often, the criterion is that the separation should be greater than the linewidth, so of the same order. Though for "clearly resolved", perhaps the separation is a few times the linewidth.

However, since the options may have (Possibly) this needs (maybe the answer is photon energy corresponding to visible spectrum, but wait this is energy difference between the two levels. Wait, probably one nano-second and ten nano-second lifetimes, linewidth  ~ micro-eV. Thus options maybe from 1e-5 eV (which is 0.01 meV), 1e-6 eV or lower.

But to think from answer options, typically something like Zeeman effect in magnetic fields results in eV differences; but if this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps is larger.. Wait no, perhaps not. Let me revisit the calculation:

Given:

tau1=1e-9 s: ΔE1= ħ/tau = (6.58e-16 eV s)/1e-9 s=6.58e-7 eV

Similarly for tau2=1e-8 s:6.58e-8 eV

Combined full width:6.58e-7 +6.58e-8≈7.24e-7 eV.

Thus, acceptable energy difference must be larger than this.

Now, the possible energy differences are, say:

A:1e-4 eV=0.1 meV        B:1e-5 eV   C:1e-6 eV  D:1e-7 eV.

If so, the correct answer would ve C:1e-6 eV, since 1e-6 >7.24e-7. But depending on precision, perhaps the actual option is "1e-6 eV". I think many textbooks consider resolution when the separation is greater than the sum of their linewidths, so  yes, answer is likely in 1e-6 eV range.

But in actual exams or homework, when I pose similar questions, often lower exponent is the correct option. For  example, 1e-4 eV would be way too big but if options allows, often times in quantum mechanics cases where natural linewidths are on the order of micro-eV like here.

But without seeing the actual options, of course, it's a guess. But I think within the calculation, the answer is on the order of magnitude of 1e-6 eV.

Therefore, given possible options, pick the one matching approximately1e-6 eV.

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least on the order of \boxed{10^{-6} \, \text{eV}} to clearly resolve the two quantum states.

In quantum mechanics, we need to determine what energy separation allows two quantum states to be distinctly observable. We have two states with different lifetimes - one at 10^-9 seconds and another at 10^-8 seconds. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle connects energy uncertainty to lifetime through the relationship ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is Planck's constant divided by 2π (approximately 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s).

Using this relationship, we can find the energy uncertainty for each state. For the first state with τ1 = 10^-9 seconds, we calculate ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 J, which converts to 6.58e-7 eV. For the second state with τ2 = 10^-8 seconds, we get ΔE2 = 1.0545718e-26 J, equivalent to 6.58e-8 eV.

For spectral lines following a Lorentzian distribution (which results from exponential decay), the total linewidth is found by adding the individual linewidths. Therefore, the total uncertainty ΔE_total equals ΔE1 + ΔE2, which comes to approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Following the Rayleigh criterion, which defines when two peaks can be distinguished, the energy separation between the states (ΔE_21 = |E2 - E1|) must exceed the sum of their uncertainties. Thus, for these states to be clearly resolved, their energy difference needs to be significantly larger than 7.24e-7 eV.

The linewidth analysis based on the uncertainty principle shows that any energy separation smaller than this value would result in overlapping spectral peaks that couldn't be distinguished clearly. Therefore, any proposed energy difference must be notably larger than this calculated threshold of 7.24e-7 eV to ensure the states can be resolved distinctly.

Alright, I need to determine the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be distinctly resolved. The lifetimes provided are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. I recall the uncertainty principle linking lifetime to energy uncertainty. Essentially, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle suggests the product of uncertainties in energy and time approximates Planck's constant divided by 2π, expressed as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. More specifically, the energy uncertainty ΔE is approximately related to the lifetime τ (tau) by the formula ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, because a state's lifetime correlates with its energy spread.

In practice, energy levels aren’t perfectly defined; they possess a natural linewidth due to their finite lifetimes. If the energy separation between the two states exceeds their combined uncertainties, they are discernable; otherwise, overlapping occurs, making them indistinguishable.

Let me compute the energy uncertainty of each state. The first state, with a lifetime of τ1 = 10^-9 seconds, yields ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. For the second state, τ2 = 10^-8 seconds, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The plan is to use Planck’s constant h, roughly 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, so ħ = h/(2π) equates to about 1.0545718 x 10^-34 J·s.

Calculating ΔE1 results in: ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J. Similarly, ΔE2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J. However, in quantum mechanics, specifically for transitions, energy is often expressed in electron volts (eV). I will convert these values to eV by dividing by 1.602176634e-19 J/eV.

For ΔE1: 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Then for ΔE2: 1.0545718e-26 J / 1.602176634e-19 = 6.58e-8 eV.

Consequently, the energy uncertainties are approximately 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for states 1 and 2, respectively.

Addressing the combined uncertainty — when distinguishing two peaks, the cumulative linewidth is the sum of their linewidths. Therefore, ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Thus, add these uncertainties: ΔE_total ≈ 6.58e-7 eV + 6.58e-8 eV = 7.24e-7 eV.

For two spectral lines to be resolved, the energy separation must substantially exceed the total linewidth. This concept mirrors the Rayleigh criterion in optics, which declares two peaks distinguishable when their separation surpasses the sum of their full width at half maximum (FWHM) values. Accordingly, the energy difference ΔE between the states should be greater than their combined uncertainties.

Hence, ΔE_21 = |E2 - E1| > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) ≈ 7e-7 eV. Consequently, the energy difference should surpass 7.24e-7 eV. In the context of multiple-choice questions, suitable options would account for an energy difference larger than this threshold.

The energy-time uncertainty relation is a bit trickier than position-momentum because time isn\'t an operator in quantum mechanics. However, in this context, for an excited state with lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. So that approach is correct.\n\nSo the energy uncertainty for each state is inverse to its lifetime. The state with shorter lifetime (10^-9 s) has a larger uncertainty: so ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. And the one with longer lifetime, ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV. Total ≈7.24e-7 eV.\n\nTherefore, to resolve them, the energy difference should be (using some resolution criterion). For two Lorentzians, the resolution criterion is sometimes taken when the separation is twice the FWHM. Wait, perhaps it\'s different from the Gaussian case, where Rayleigh is based on overlapping intensities. Maybe in this context, the simple idea is that if the energy difference is much larger than the sum of the widths, you can resolve them.\n\nBut here, for precise answer, the problem probably wants you to compute the linewidths and pick the energy difference larger than their sum.\n\nIf I need to express the answer in Joules or eV: the sum is about 7.24e-7 eV. So any option higher than that will do.\n\nUsually, typical energy differences in atomic transitions are on the order of eV, but for very closely spaced levels, like in some hyperfine structures or in certain solid-state systems, you can have smaller energy differences. For example, nuclear magnetic resonance deals with energy differences of the order of 1e-6 eV (microelectronvolts). So for those to be resolved, the lifetime must be long enough to have a narrow linewidth.\n\nBut in this problem, the linewidth is 7e-7 eV. Therefore, any energy difference higher than that. So the answer would require a ΔE of around 1e-6 eV or higher. But in the absence of options, we can state the value. But let me check the steps again.\n\nRecalculating ΔE1 and ΔE2:\n\nΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.\n\nConvert to eV: 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, ΔE2 = 1.0545718e-34 /1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J. Which is ~6.58e-8 eV.\n\nSo combining the uncertainties: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV. So approximately 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nThus, the energy difference should be significantly larger than 7.24e-7 eV. If the options given are 1e-6 eV, 1e-7 eV, etc., then 1e-6 eV would be 1000 times the linewidth. Hmm, but I think that 1e-6 eV is one order of magnitude larger, right? Just 1e-6 is about ten times larger (since 7.2e-7 is 0.72e-6). So, an energy difference of 1e-6 (which is around 1.4 times the linewidth sum) may still allow resolution if using a criterion like Rayleigh, though it might not be \'clearly\' resolved. For clear resolving, usually the peak separation is a few times the FWHM. But given that exact specifications depend on criteria, but unless the problem gives specific options, it\'s hard to precisely answer.\n\nBut assuming standard resolution – according to the Rayleigh criterion – the energy difference must be at least equal to the width of the peaks. Wait, in optics, the Rayleigh criterion for resolving two spectral lines is that the peaks are separated by at least the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of one of the peaks. Wait, is that the case?\n\nWait, the Rayleigh criterion states that two peaks are considered resolved when the maximum of one coincides with the first minimum of the other. For diffraction-limited optics (like Airy disks), this occurs when the angular separation is such. For Gaussian beams, the criterion is when the separation is greater than the standard deviation. For Lorentzian lineshapes, which have broader tails, the FWHM is wider. However, in practice, in spectroscopy, people might use different criteria for resolvability. Sometimes, they define the resolving power required such that the separation delta is greater than or equal to the FWHM.

Then, using the lifetime in seconds, 10^-9 sec, the frequency width is delta_nu1 ≈ 1/(2πτ1) ≈ 1/(6.28e-9) ≈ 1.6e8 Hz. Similarly, delta_nu2 ≈ 1/(6.28e-8) ≈ 1.6e7 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the peak widths in frequency are around 160 MHz for the first state and 16 MHz for the second.

To distinguish two quantum states with energies \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) with lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds respectively, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty \(\Delta E\) is related to the lifetime \(\tau\) by \(\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}\).

1. **Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:**
   - For \(E_1\) with \(\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\) s:
     \[
     \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Converting to electron volts:
     \[
     \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
     \]

   - For \(E_2\) with \(\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\) s:
     \[
     \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Converting to electron volts:
     \[
     \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
     \]

2. **Combine the uncertainties:**
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

3. **Determine the required energy difference:**
   To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \(|E_2 - E_1|\) must be significantly larger than the combined uncertainty. A common criterion is that the energy difference should be at least on the order of \(10^{-6}\) eV.

Thus, the energy difference should be at least on the order of \(10^{-6}\) eV. The correct option is \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}.

iemens, but maybe they use a different approach, such as taking the longer lifetime, the shorter lifetime?

Wait, also, let me confirm time-energy uncertainty. The energy-time uncertainty relation is a bit trickier than position-momentum because time isn't an operator in quantum mechanics. However, in this context, for an excited state with lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty (natural linewidth) is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. So that approach is correct.

So the energy uncertainty for each state is inverse to its lifetime. The state with shorter lifetime (10^-9 s) has a larger uncertainty: so ΔE1 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. And the one with longer lifetime, ΔE2 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV. Total ≈7.24e-7 eV.

Therefore, to resolve them, the energy difference should be (using some resolution criterion). For two Lorentzians, the resolution criterion is sometimes taken when the separation is twice the FWHM. Wait, perhaps it's different from the Gaussian case, where Rayleigh is based on overlapping intensities. Maybe in this context, the simple idea is that if the energy difference is much larger than the sum of the widths, you can resolve them.

But here, for precise answer, the problem probably wants you to compute the linewidths and pick the energy difference larger than their sum.

If I need to express the answer in Joules or eV: the sum is about 7.24e-7 eV. So any option higher than that will do.

Usually, typical energy differences in atomic transitions are on the order of eV, but for very closely spaced levels, like in some hyperfine structures or in certain solid-state systems, you can have smaller energy differences. For example, nuclear magnetic resonance deals with energy differences of the order of 1e-6 eV (microelectronvolts). So for those to be resolved, the lifetime must be long enough to have a narrow linewidth.

But in this problem, the linewidth is 7e-7 eV. Therefore, any energy difference higher than that. So the answer would require a ΔE of around 1e-6 eV or higher. But in the absence of options, we can state the value. But let me check the steps again.

Recalculating ΔE1 and ΔE2:

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = 1.0545718e-34 /1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J. Which is ~6.58e-8 eV.

So combining the uncertainties: 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 = 7.238e-7 eV. So approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Thus, the energy difference should be significantly larger than 7.24e-7 eV. If the options given are 1e-6 eV, 1e-7 eV, etc., then 1e-6 eV would be 1000 times the linewidth. Hmm, but I think that 1e-6 eV is one order of magnitude larger, right? Just 1e-6 is about ten times larger (since 7.2e-7 is 0.72e-6). So, an energy difference of 1e-6 (which is around 1.4 times the linewidth sum) may still allow resolution if using a criterion like Rayleigh, though it might not be 'clearly' resolved. For clear resolving, usually the peak separation is a few times the FWHM. But given that exact specifications depend on criteria, but unless the problem gives specific options, it's hard to precisely answer.

But assuming standard resolution – according to the Rayleigh criterion – the energy difference must be at least equal to the width of the peaks. Wait, in optics, the Rayleigh criterion for resolving two spectral lines is that the peaks are separated by at least the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of one of the peaks. Wait, is that the case?

Wait, the Rayleigh criterion states that two peaks are considered resolved when the maximum of one coincides with the first minimum of the other. For diffraction-limited optics (like Airy disks), this occurs when the angular separation is such. For Gaussian beams, the criterion is when the separation is greater than the standard deviation. For Lorentzian lineshapes, which have broader tails, the FWHM is wider. However, in practice, in spectroscopy, people might use different criteria for resolvability. Sometimes, they define the resolving power required such that the separation delta is greater than or equal to the FWHM. So if the two peaks are each characterized by a FWHM of gamma1 and gamma2 (where gamma is the linewidth), if their separation is much greater than gamma1 + gamma2, then they are considered resolved.

So likely in this problem, the required energy difference should be greater than the sum of the individual linewidths.

Hence, if sum of linewidths is approximately 7.24e-7 eV, the answer would need to be something larger. Possible options might then be 1e-6 eV (1 micro-eV), 1e-5 eV, 1e-4 eV,...

But since the calculated sum is 7.24e-7 ~ 0.7 micro-eV, an energy separation of 1 micro-eV (1e-6 eV) would be enough to distinguish them. Then, if the options include 1e-6 eV, that is the answer.

Alternatively, if the options are in Joules, but given that the answer is at 1e-6 eV, which is in the microelectronvolt range. Depending on the context.

Another approach is in terms of frequency. Because energy can be related to frequency via E = hν. So the frequency width would delta_nu = delta_E / h.

Hence, the frequency uncertainty for each state would be delta_nu1 = (1/(2πτ1)), and delta_nu2 = (1/(2πτ2)). Then, using the lifetime in seconds, 10^-9 sec, the frequency width is delta_nu1 ≈ 1/(2πτ1) ≈ 1/(6.28e-9) ≈ 1.6e8 Hz. Similarly, delta_nu2 ≈ 1/(6.28e-8) ≈ 1.6e7 Hz.

Therefore, the peak widths in frequency are around 160 MHz for the first state and 16 MHz for the second. The total spread is around 176 MHz compatibility.

To be resolvable, the frequency difference would need to be larger than that total. Then convert that back to energy using E = h*delta_nu.

So, if, say, the frequency difference is 200 MHz (which is 2e8 Hz), then energy separation would be h * 2e8. Since h is 6.626e-34 Js. So, E = 6.626e-34 * 2e8 = 1.325e-25 J. Convert to eV: 1.325e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.27e-7 eV, which is close to the previous combined uncertainty. But that would be similar to the sum of. So again, a larger frequency = larger energy difference.

But perhaps the ideal here is to use the energy-time uncertainty principle as first calculation. So the minimal energy difference should be greater than delta_E1 + delta_E2. So 7.24e-7 eV. So if their energy difference is larger than, say, 1e-6 eV, you can resolve. Therefore, if the available options include something like 1e-6 eV (1 micro-eV) then that's the answer. If options have numbers like 1e-5 or 1e-4, those would be even clearer.

But given we have to choose between potential options, if the options are  something like:

A) 1e-5 eV

B) 1e-6 eV

C) 1e-7 eV

D) 1e-8 eV

Then, the correct one would be B) 1e-6 eV since it's larger than 7e-7 eV. While if "clearly distinguish" requires a more strict condition, maybe a larger value, but among standard multiples, 1e-6 is the closest.

Alternatively, another possible answer is given if you look at it using linewidth as full width half max (FWHM) is gamma = ħ / tau. So, E1 and E2’s widths being gamma1 and gamma2. So the resolution condition |E2 - E1| > gamma1 + gamma2. So that would make sure they don't overlap.

Therefore, candidate answer options must be greater that sum (7.2e-7eV). Hence, needing about 1e-6 eV. So if one of the options is 10^-6 eV, that is the answer.

Assuming that in some problem the options are, for example, given in 1e-4, 1e-5, 1e-6, 1e-7 eV, so 1e-6 would be the earliest greater than the total uncertainty sum.

Alternatively, if combining in another way... Wait, if the transitions are E2-E1, then depending if those states are initial and final levels. Let’s say one decays to the other. Then the linewidth of the transition would be the sum of the linewidths of both states. Since each state's lifetime contributes to the broadening of the transition.

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least on the order of \(10^{-6}\) eV. Therefore, the correct option is \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}.

To determine the energy difference that allows two quantum states to be clearly distinguished, we use the **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \tau \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

where:
- \(\Delta E\) is the energy uncertainty,
- \(\tau\) is the lifetime of the state,
- \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}\ \text{J·s}\).

### Step 1: Calculate Energy Uncertainties
For each state:
1. **State 1 (\(E_1\))**: \(\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\ \text{s}\)
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}\ \text{J·s}}{10^{-9}\ \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}\ \text{J} = 6.58 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{eV}
   \]
2. **State 2 (\(E_2\))**: \(\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\ \text{s}\)
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}\ \text{J·s}}{10^{-8}\ \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}\ \text{J} = 6.58 \times 10^{-8}\ \text{eV}
   \]

### Step 2: Total Uncertainty
The **total linewidth** for energy resolution is the sum of uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7}\ \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Resolution Criterion
To resolve two peaks in a spectrum (Rayleigh Criterion), their energy separation \(\Delta E_{21} = |E_2 - E_1|\) must satisfy:
\[
\Delta E_{21} \gg \Delta E_{\text{total}}
\]

### Conclusion
The energy difference between the two states must be **significantly greater than** \(\mathbf{7.24 \times 10^{-7}\ \textbf{eV}}\). Options below this value would result in overlapping spectral lines that cannot be clearly resolved.

**Answer:**  
\(\boxed{1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV}}\)

 Let me check the orders of magnitude. The computed value is about 1e-6 eV (if it's 7.24e-7, it's 0.724e-6). Therefore, a required energy difference of around 10^-6 eV or higher would be sufficient.

Alternatively, if we have two separate energy levels, and want to see them as separate peaks, the spacing should be larger than the sum of their linewidths.

Wait, so in an energy level diagram, for two metastable states (each with their own lifetimes), if they decay via some path, the transitions from these states would have widths related to their lifetimes. But the energy spacing between them must be larger than their combined natural linewidths (sum of the FWHM of each) to be distinct. So yes, Γ1 + Γ2 is roughly the total width.

Alternatively, Γ1 is the linewidth of the transition if they emit, but perhaps?

Wait, perhaps if we have two separate states, each decaying with their own lifetimes. If each transition's linewidth is inversely proportional to their respective lifetimes. So, suppose these aren’t the upper levels toward the same transition but two separate states whose energies we are trying to measure. We can measure the energies with some uncertainty; the lifetime defines the inherent uncertainty in the energy. So to resolve two energies E1 and E2, the difference must be greater than the combined uncertainties.

Assuming that each energy level has an uncertainty of ΔE1 and ΔE2, the combined uncertainty is the quadratically sum if the uncertainties are independent, but here the question just says "clearly resolved," probably referring to the sum.

But I think in spectroscopy, the criteria is that the peak separation is greater than the sum of the linewidths. For example, in optics, the Rayleigh criterion is that the separation is greater than the FWHM. If two lines have different linewidths, then for them to be just resolved, the separation must be on the order of half the sum of the two linewidths.

Wait, that might differ.
