To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X (Lithium-6) is 0.96c, we follow these steps:

1. **Identify the rest mass of Lithium-6**:
   - Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.
   - The isotopic mass of Lithium-6 is approximately 6.015122887 atomic mass units (u).
   - Convert this mass to energy using \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):
     \[
     \text{Rest energy} = 6.015122887 \, \text{u} \times 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} \approx 5603.0515 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\))**:
   - Given \(v = 0.96c\):
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
     \]

3. **Compute the total energy**:
   - Total energy \(E_{\text{total}} = \gamma \times \text{Rest energy}\):
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = 3.5714 \times 5603.0515 \, \text{MeV} \approx 20010.8978 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

4. **Determine the kinetic energy**:
   - Kinetic energy \(K = E_{\text{total}} - \text{Rest energy}\):
     \[
     K = 20010.8978 \, \text{MeV} - 5603.0515 \, \text{MeV} \approx 14407.8463 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

5. **Convert the result to GeV for the final answer**:
   - \[
     14407.8463 \, \text{MeV} = 14.4078463 \, \text{GeV}
     \]
   - Rounded to four decimal places (precision of 1e-4):
     \[
     14.4078 \, \text{GeV}
     \]

### Final Answer
The energy of the RHIC is \boxed{14.4078} GeV.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out what exactly the question is asking for. The energy here probably refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon or the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. Since RHIC is a particle accelerator, they likely mention the kinetic energy imparted to the nuclei. But I need to confirm that. Sometimes in physics, when talking about energy in colliders, they refer to the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But maybe in this context, it's the kinetic energy. Hmm. Wait, but let me recall. In accelerator physics, the energy is sometimes given as the kinetic energy per nucleon, especially for heavy ions. But I need to check. Let's assume that the problem wants the total kinetic energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c. But perhaps it's better to be precise.

So, Lithium with 3 neutrons. Lithium's atomic number is 3, so it has 3 protons. The standard isotope is Lithium-6 or Lithium-7. Adding 3 neutrons to Lithium... If it's regular Lithium with 3 neutrons, then the most common isotope is Lithium-6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons) but here it's specified as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, normal Lithium has varying isotopes. Lithium-7 has 4 neutrons. So if the nucleus is Lithium with 3 neutrons, that would be Lithium-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making the mass number 6. Okay, so the isotope here is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. So each nucleus has 6 nucleons. The total rest mass would be the mass of Li-6 nucleus.

But in terms of calculations, maybe they want us to approximate using the atomic mass unit. Let's check: The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 u, and the neutron is 1.008665 u. The Li-6 nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. But the actual mass of Li-6 is less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy. However, maybe for the sake of this problem, we are to use the approximation where the mass is simply the sum of protons and neutrons. Or perhaps use the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me see. Since it's about the relativistic energy, which uses the rest mass, perhaps we need the exact rest mass. Alternatively, the question might just expect using the mass number times the atomic mass unit. Let me check the standard approach.

In many relativity problems, especially in exams or textbooks, when dealing with nuclei, they often approximate the rest mass as A times the atomic mass unit, u, where A is the mass number. Since each proton and neutron is approximately 1 u, so total mass would be about 6 u. But, for better precision, the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.015122887 u. But if I use 6.015122887 u or just 6 u, the difference might be significant? Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the rest mass is simply A times the proton mass. Wait, but protons and neutrons have almost the same mass. The difference might be negligible here given that 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make up 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) u. Let's compute this.

Protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u
Neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u
Total: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u

But the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.015123 u. So there's a difference of about 0.0327 u, which is due to the binding energy. But considering the precision required is 1e-4, which is four decimal places, this difference could be significant. Hence, maybe we need to use the actual mass of Li-6. Wait, but maybe in this problem, since they don't provide the exact mass, we are supposed to use approximate values. Alternatively, the mass number times the atomic mass unit. Since the problem statement doesn't specify, maybe we can assume that the rest mass is 6 u where 1 u is 931.494 MeV/c². Well, but even so, in high-energy physics, sometimes they just use A times the proton mass. But protons and neutrons have nearly the same mass, so maybe approximate the mass as A * u, where u is unified atomic mass unit.

Alternatively, we can calculate using the actual mass of Li-6, but perhaps without knowing the exact mass, how is that possible? Wait, maybe they just want us to use the sum of protons and neutrons mass (ignoring binding energy) or approximate as A * u. Since the problem statement doesn't provide exact mass, maybe it's okay to approximate the nuclear mass as 6 u, or 3*proton + 3*neutron.

But to check, let me recall: 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c². If we take the Li-6 nucleus as 6 u, then rest mass energy is 6 * 931.494 MeV ≈ 5588.964 MeV. But if we take the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, which we calculated as approximately 6.047823 u, so rest mass energy would be approximately 6.047823 * 931.494 ≈ 5632.78 MeV. The difference is about 43.81 MeV, which is significant. Wait, but is this necessary?

Given that the problem mentions "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which is 0.0001, which is four decimal places. Hmm. So 1e-4 relative precision. So when we compute gamma, we need to perform the calculations keeping enough decimal places. So, probably, it's essential to use the actual rest mass, but since the problem didn't give us the mass, we might need to approximate. Wait, in these types of problems, perhaps we are to use the mass number multiplied by the atomic mass unit, sometimes called the "atomic mass unit per nucleon," so that each nucleon contributes approximately 931.494 MeV/c² of rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest energy is just the number of nucleons (which is 6) multiplied by the energy equivalent of the atomic mass unit. 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c². Therefore, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 6 * 931.494 MeV. Therefore, rest energy E_rest = 6 * 931.494 MeV, which is approximately 5588.964 MeV. Then, given that speed v = 0.96c, we need to compute the total energy, which is gamma * E_rest, and then subtract the rest energy to get the kinetic energy. Wait, but the problem says "the energy of the RHIC". So is that kinetic energy or total energy?

In accelerator physics, the "energy" sometimes refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon. For example, RHIC collides heavy ions at 100 GeV per nucleon. But maybe in the question, the energy is the total kinetic energy. The problem is not explicit, so maybe it should be made clear. Hmm. The problem says "energy of the RHIC" which is ambiguous. But in the context, since they are colliding nuclei, the energy is typically given as kinetic energy per nucleon. Wait, but let me think again.

The problem states: "the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So we can calculate the total energy, which is gamma * m * c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m * c^2. So if "energy of RHIC" refers to the kinetic energy given to the nucleus, which would make sense, then the answer is (gamma - 1) * m * c².

But perhaps "energy" here is meant as total energy. Would need to check similar problems. However, standard terminology: in accelerators, kinetic energy is usually what's being referred to. For example, the LHC accelerates protons to 6.5 TeV of kinetic energy. Wait, no: actually, in the LHC, the "energy" is specified as the total energy. Because protons are relativistic and the kinetic energy is a significant fraction of the total energy. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me think again. For a particle moving at speed v, total energy is gamma*m*c^2 and kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)*m*c². Since RHIC accelerates particles to certain energies, it could be either. However, given that it says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c," I think they are referring to the kinetic energy, because if you set the speed, the total energy is gamma*m*c², but assuming that specifying the speed allows you to calculate the necessary kinetic energy imparted. Therefore, K = (gamma - 1)*m*c².

Alternatively, perhaps in the question, "energy of the RHIC" is given as the total energy. Let's see. Either way, I need to figure out based on standard terminology.

In particle physics, when we talk about the "beam energy," it can be ambiguous. But often, the term "beam energy" can refer to the kinetic energy per nucleon, especially for heavy ions. For example, RHIC is known to collide gold nuclei at 100 GeV per nucleon. So each nucleon has 100 GeV of kinetic energy. However, the problem here asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So since speed depends on the Lorentz factor, which is a function of the total energy, but if we are given the speed, then once we calculate gamma, we can find either total energy or kinetic energy. So maybe the answer is looking for the kinetic energy. Alternatively, gamma is just a factor, which the user has to compute for the given velocity.

Additionally, the problem mentions the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, so we need the mass of that nucleus to compute gamma, and then energy.

So the approach should be:

1. Determine the rest mass of the nucleus (Li-6).
2. Calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.
3. Use gamma to compute total energy (E_total = gamma * m * c²) or kinetic energy (K = (gamma - 1) * m * c²).
4. Express the result with the required precision.

But getting back to step 1: How do we calculate the rest mass?

Assuming that the problem allows approximate calculation with mass number:

But perhaps we can more precisely compute using the actual mass of Li-6. Let's find the exact mass.

The isotopic mass of Li-6 is 6.015122887 u (from the periodic table or nuclear data). So in atomic mass units, that's 6.015122887 u.

Alternatively, considering that the Li-6 nucleus is made up of 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and binding energy. But given that the isotope's mass is given as 6.015122887 u, which is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons (which is 6.047823 u as calculated earlier). Therefore, the nuclear binding energy has resulted in a mass reduction.

But to calculate relativistic energy, perhaps we should use the actual rest mass of the nucleus. However, the problem does not provide that information, so maybe it expects us to approximate, for example, using A = 6 with m = 6*u.

Alternatively, since Lithium has atomic number 3, but if the nucleus is Lithium with 3 neutrons, it's Li-6. Let's go with that isotopic mass. So, Li-6 mass is 6.015122887 u.

But given that the required answer has a precision of 1e-4, then maybe 1e-4 of what? If the energy is in MeV, then four decimal places would be thousandths of an MeV. Wait, 1e-4 of 1 MeV is 0.0001 MeV = 100 eV precision. That's possible.

So to compute accurately, let's use the exact isotopic mass:

Mass of Li-6 nucleus: 6.015122887 u.

But given that the problem does not provide this value, perhaps we can represent it algebraically. But wait, sometimes protons and neutrons are given as approximate if the problem does not specify exact mass. Alternatively, the problem expects us to use the mass number multiplied by 1 u. Wait, but according to standard physics, the rest mass of a nucleus is not exactly mass number times 1 u. But for simplicity, if they don't give the exact value, maybe we can assume A = 6, m = 6 u. Let's make that assumption unless told otherwise. So m = 6 * u.

But given that even with that, there's the uncertainty. Hmm. Since the problem statement didn't specify the mass but just says "X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons," perhaps it's Li-6. But even so, without the precise isotopic mass, perhaps we need to use a certain approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of computing gamma, the exact mass isn't necessary. Wait, no, because K = (gamma - 1)*m*c². So if the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, it is directly proportional to m. Therefore, a different mass would lead to a different kinetic energy.

Therefore, given that the problem requires a precise answer (to 1e-4), perhaps the actual rest mass is required. However, since the problem does not provide it, perhaps there is a different approach. Wait, but Lithium with 3 protons and 3 neutrons is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015123 u. So let's proceed with that. To find this mass in kg:

1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg

Therefore, m = 6.015122887 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u ≈ 6.015122887 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Wait, but if we are working in natural units where c=1, maybe we can compute directly in units of MeV/c².

But 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c². So m = 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/(c²·u) ≈ 6.015122887 * 931.49410242 MeV/c² ≈ let's compute this.

First, let's compute 6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452 MeV/c².

Then 0.015122887 * 931.49410242 ≈

Let's compute 0.01 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242
0.005122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ ?

Compute 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121
0.000122887 * 931.4941 ≈ 0.000122887 * 931.4941 ≈ approximately 0.114564 (exact computation: 0.000122887 * 931.4941). Let's do it step by step:

0.0001 * 931.4941 ≈ 0.09314941
0.000022887 * 931.4941 ≈ 0.000022887 * 931.4941 ≈ 0.0213046

So total ≈ 0.09314941 + 0.0213046 ≈ 0.114454.

Therefore, 0.005122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 4.6574705121 + 0.114454 ≈ 4.7719245

Thus, 0.015122887 * 931.4941 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.7719245 ≈ 14.0868655

Therefore, total mass energy:

5588.96461452 + 14.0868655 ≈ 5603.05148 MeV/c²

So, m = approximately 5603.05148 MeV/c².

Wait, but let me check this with a calculator perhaps for better precision. Alternatively, let's compute 6.015122887 * 931.49410242:

First, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452

0.015122887 * 931.49410242:

Compute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122887 * 931.49410242:

Express 0.005122887 as 5.122887e-3

5e-3 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.122887e-3 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.122887 * 0.93149410242 ≈ 0.11456

Adding to 4.6574705121 + 0.11456 ≈ 4.77203

Then total 9.3149410242 + 4.77203 ≈ 14.08697

Therefore, total m = 5588.96461452 + 14.08697 ≈ 5603.05158 MeV/c²

So approximately 5603.0516 MeV/c².

So rest mass energy E_rest = 5603.0516 MeV.

Given that v = 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²)

0.96² = 0.9216

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28

Therefore, gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714286

But let me compute it precisely:

sqrt(0.0784) = sqrt(784/10000) = sqrt(784)/100 = 28/100 = 0.28

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714285714

Therefore, gamma ≈ 3.5714285714

Therefore, total energy E_total = gamma * m * c² = gamma * E_rest ≈ 3.5714285714 * 5603.0516 MeV ≈ let's compute!

3 * 5603.0516 = 16809.1548

0.5714285714 * 5603.0516 ≈

0.5 * 5603.0516 = 2801.5258

0.0714285714 * 5603.0516 ≈ (1/14) * 5603.0516 ≈ 5603.0516 / 14 ≈ 400.21797

So total 0.5714285714 * 5603.0516 ≈ 2801.5258 + 400.21797 ≈ 3201.74377

Therefore, E_total ≈ 16809.1548 + 3201.74377 ≈ 20010.8986 MeV

So, E_total ≈ 20010.8986 MeV.

Then, kinetic energy K = E_total - E_rest ≈ 20010.8986 - 5603.0516 ≈ 14407.847 MeV

So, approximately 14407.847 MeV.

But the problem says, "the energy of the RHIC". Since this is the kinetic energy, approximately 14,407.85 MeV, which is 14.40785 GeV. Wait, 14,407.85 MeV is 14.40785 GeV. But in heavy ion colliders, energies are often given per nucleon. The rest mass energy per nucleon for Li-6 is 5603.0516 MeV /6 ≈ 933.8419 MeV per nucleon.

But the kinetic energy per nucleon would be 14,407.85 MeV /6 ≈ 2401.308 MeV or 2.401308 GeV per nucleon. But maybe the problem is asking for the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. If so, it's about 14.40785 GeV. But the problem doesn't specify per nucleon, so perhaps it's the total.

However, in practice, RHIC and other accelerators typically specify energy per nucleon. For example, the RHIC can collide heavy ions like gold at 100 GeV per nucleon. Therefore, we can assume that the question is referring to the kinetic energy per nucleon, but the problem says "the energy of the RHIC", which is unclear. But given that they have a lithium nucleus with 6 nucleons, so the total kinetic energy is K_total = 14.40785 GeV, and kinetic energy per nucleon is K = K_total /6 ≈ 2.401308 GeV.

But perhaps not. Since the problem only asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c, perhaps we need to state the total energy (but in the physics terminology, this is the kinetic energy). Alternatively, since gamma is only dependent on speed, maybe the energy here is gamma. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the wording is ambiguous, but probably looking for the kinetic energy. Let me check once more. If energy is the kinetic energy, then answer is about 14.40785 GeV or 14407.85 MeV. To convert to the units they might want, perhaps in GeV with four decimal places: 14.4078 GeV. If that’s required. But since the rest mass was approximated here. However, given that the problem requires a precision of 1e-4, which is 0.0001.

Wait, 0.0001 is relative precision. So for example, if the answer is ~14 GeV, 1e-4 is 0.0014 GeV = 1.4 MeV. So unless our calculation is accurate to within 1.4 MeV, we can't be sure. But in the calculation above, the gamma is exact since v is given as 0.96c. The possible error is in the rest mass.

Given that the rest mass of Li-6 is approximated as 6.015123 u, we used 931.494 MeV per u. Let's check: 1 u is precisely 931.49410242 MeV/c². So our calculation is precise.

The main question then is, how precise was our calculation.

We calculated gamma as exactly 25/7, which is 3.5714285714...

E_rest as approximately 5603.05158 MeV.

Multiplying by gamma gives E_total as 25/7 * 5603.05158.

So precisely, 5603.05158 ÷ 7 = 800.43594 MeV, times 25 = 20010.8985 MeV.

Then K = E_total - E_rest = 20010.8985 - 5603.05158 = 20010.8985 - 5603.05158 = 14407.84692 MeV.

Which gives 14407.8469 MeV ≈ 14,407.8469 MeV. Therefore, 14,407.8469 MeV or 14.4078469 GeV. So they probably want this answer in GeV with four decimal places. So 14.4078 GeV. However, let's check.

But to get the precision right, maybe we need to calculate more decimal places in each step.

Going back:

First, the mass of Li-6 is 6.015122887 u.

Convert it to MeV/c²:

6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/u = ?
Compute:

6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452

0.015122887 * 931.49410242 ≈

Let's break it down:

0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122887 * 931.49410242 =

0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.000122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.000122887 * 931.4941 = let's compute:

0.0001 * 931.4941 = 0.09314941

0.000022887 * 931.4941 = 0.0213043

Thus, in total: 0.09314941 + 0.0213043 = 0.11445371

Thus, 0.005122887 * 931.4941 ≈ 4.6574705121 + 0.11445371 = 4.77192422

Therefore, total 0.015122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.77192422 ≈ 14.08686524

Thus, total mass:

6.015122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 5588.96461452 + 14.08686524 ≈ 5603.05148 MeV/c²

Wait, so m*c² = 5603.05148 MeV.

Gamma for v = 0.96c:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.5714285714...

Total energy E_total = gamma * m*c² = 3.5714285714 * 5603.05148 = let's compute.

First, let me convert gamma to fractions. Since 0.96 = 24/25, but wait:

Wait, v/c = 0.96 = 24/25; 24/25 squared is 576/625, hence, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 576/625 = 49/625, so square root is 7/25, so gamma = 1 / (7/25) = 25/7 = 3 + 4/7 ≈ 3.5714285714.

Therefore, E_total = (25/7) * 5603.05148

First compute 5603.05148 /7:

5603.05148 ÷ 7 = 800.435911428...

Multiply by 25:

800.435911428... * 25 = 800 * 25 + 0.435911428 *25 = 20,000 + 10.8977857 = 20,010.8977857 MeV.

So E_total = 20,010.8977857 MeV

Then, the kinetic energy K = E_total - E_rest = 20,010.8977857 - 5,603.05148 = 14,407.8463057 MeV

Therefore, K = 14,407.8463057 MeV

Convert to GeV: 14.4078463057 GeV

So, with a precision of 1e-4 (which is 0.0001). The fifth decimal is 8, which would round to 14.4078 GeV when we take four decimals. Wait but 14.4078463057... The fourth decimal is 8, the fifth is 4, so round down? No, 14.4078463057 is:

First decimal: 0.4
Second: 0.40
Third: 0.407
Fourth: 0.4078
Fifth: 0.40784 (with 6th digit 3057 truncated)

Wait, no.

If we have 14.4078463057 GeV:

14.4078463057 GeV is equal to:

14 GeV + 0.4078463057 GeV.

So the decimal places after are:

0.4078|463057 GeV

So, the first four decimal places are 4078, the fifth is 4, the sixth is 6, so 0.407846… So, when rounding to four decimal places, since the fifth decimal is 4 (<=5), we just cut off at the fourth decimal.

Therefore, 0.4078 GeV, so total 14.4078 GeV.

Thus, the energy is 14.4078 GeV, with the precision of 0.0001 GeV. However, it might expect the answer in MeV. 14.4078 GeV is 14,407.8 MeV. Here, written as 14407.8463 MeV, rounding to the nearest 0.1 MeV, but the required precision is 1e-4. Since the question mentions "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which likely refers to relative precision of 0.01% or four significant digits. However, maybe converting it to Joules? No, in particle physics, energy is usually in eV units. So 14.4078 GeV.

But wait, the energy of RHIC, usually given per nucleon. So it's Li-6 with 6 nucleons. So if we calculated the kinetic energy per nucleon, then the KE per nucleon is 14.4078 GeV /6 ≈ 2.4013 GeV per nucleon. If RHIC's energy is given per nucleon, as is common.

But since the problem specifically mentions "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c", it refers to the total energy(?). Because the speed of the nucleus as a whole is 0.96c, so the entire nucleus's kinetic energy.

But in accelerators, the energy is specified per nucleon. For instance, "the beam energy is 100 GeV/nucleon". But what is the standard? Let's see.

From RHIC's actual parameters, for Au (gold) ions, the energy is 100 GeV per nucleon, meaning each nucleon has 100 GeV of kinetic energy, so each gold nucleus (A=197) has total kinetic energy 197*100 GeV=19.7 TeV.

But here, the question is about the RHIC's energy. Since the problem states "energy of the RHIC", then we usually refer to per nucleon. But maybe without that, it's ambiguous.

But the problem says "the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". Given that velocity is a property of the entire nucleus, not per nucleon. Hence, answering the total kinetic energy.

If the calculation is correct, then answer is approximately 14.4078 GeV.

But we need to check the problem statement again.

"the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c"

"PS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4."

Also mentioning X is Li with 3 neutrons. So A=6.

If in the problem's mind "energy" is the kinetic energy. Computed as (gamma -1)*m*c² ≈ 14,407.85 MeV.

Thus, rounding to four decimal places, 14.4078 GeV or using more precise calculation as 14.40785 GeV, but given that 1e-4 is four decimal places, so 14.4078 GeV. However, looking in the calculator, it was 14.4078463 GeV, which rounds to 14.4078 GeV with four decimals.

But here comes the issue: is the problem expecting the answer in units of energy like GeV or MeV? Or perhaps in Joules?

Highly unlikely. In particle physics, energies are in eV units.

So the energy is approximately 14.4078 GeV.

But another thing: because the speed is given with two decimal places (0.96c), the gamma is exact (since 0.96 is 24/25, etc.), meaning the calculation for gamma is precise. The uncertainty was from the rest mass. But since the rest mass was calculated using 6.015122887 u, which is precise, if using the exact Li-6 mass, and multiplied exactly by 931.49410242 MeV/u, then it's also precise.

But in the problem, it just says X is Li with 3 neutrons. If they are using a different mass? For example, using integer mass numbers. Ie, A=6.

Wait, maybe in homework problems, without specific data given, you take A=6 and mass=6*u.

That would have been m*c²=6*931.494 MeV=5588.964 MeV.

Then gamma is 25/7≈3.571428.

Then kinetic energy K=(gamma -1)*5588.964 MeV=2.571428/1 *5588.964 MeV* (Hold on, K = (gamma -1)*m*c². So that would be (25/7 -1)*5588.964 = (18/7)*5588.964.

18/7 ≈ 2.57142857

So 2.57142857*5588.964 ≈ let's compute.

2 * 5588.964 = 11177.928

0.57142857*5588.964 ≈ 0.5*5588.964 + 0.07142857*5588.964 = 2794.482 + (5588.964 / 14)

Compute 5588.964 /14 ≈ 399.2117

So total = 2794.482 + 399.2117 ≈ 3193.6937

Therefore, total K≈11177.928 + 3193.6937≈14371.6217 MeV.≈14.3716217 GeV.

Now, this differs from the previous result by roughly 25 thousands GeV. So using approximate mass gives a different answer. Therefore, depending on whether we use the exact mass or approximate mass, the answer varies. Since the problem states "X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons", but didn't provide specific mass numbers. So if we take the problem X is Lithium with 3 neutrons, so it's a Lithium-6 nucleus. However, if in the problem's perspective approximated the atomic mass as 6 u, then the answer is approximately14,371.622 MeV.

 The difference is around 14,372 vs. 14,408 MeV. That's about a 36 MeV difference, which is significant given the required precision of 1e-4. Since 36 / 14400 ≈ 0.0025, which is 0.25% which is larger than the required 0.01%（1e-4=0.0001)?). So we need to verify which one to use.

Now, if the user intended the rest mass as 6 u (A=6) with u=931.494 MeV/c², then answer is 14,371.62 MeV

If the rest mass is exact as Li-6, then answer is14,407.85 MeV

But since the problem statement is insufficiently precise about the mass, but in test problems, perhaps we can go with A=6 and m=6*u.

But in reality, when calculating physical speeds, the exact mass does make a difference. Since the problem mentions that X is Li with 3 neutrons; in real physics, that's Li-6, so m=6.015123 u.

Therefore, probably intended is using the exact rest mass of Lithium-6. Hence, answer is ~14,407.85 MeV or 14.40785 GeV. Since required precision is 1e-4, it would be 14.4078 GeV (rounded to four decimal places. Alternatively, with more exact processing.

But maybe the assistant needs to present the answer with strict precision. However, given that different assumptions lead to different results.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to just calculate gamma and from there, write gamma m c² and maybe the rest?  No. Hopefully it's clarified.

Alternatively, given that sometimes in introductory physics problems, even for nuclei, the rest mass is taken as A multiplied by proton mass, considering both proton and neutron as approximately same mass, but only approximate. So if m = A*m_p, where m_p≈1.6726e-27 kg.

Then, m =6 * 1.6726e-27=1.00356e-26 kg.

But such approach would use m = A*m_p. But including that:

But then, kinetic energy K=(gamma-1)*m*c^2.

Alternatively, but comparing to previous results.

Alternatively, if entering the the question expects one to use a different approach, not taking into account the realitistic energy, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the problem might be worded: speed 0.96c, find kinetic energy with rest mass 6 amu. In that case, the previous calculation of ~14,371.62 MeV。

Therefore, there are two possibilities. But in the solution, to clarify.

But without being told, perhaps the problem expects to use the approximate mass. Maybe.

Since the problem specifies that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Since standard in non-advanced problems, asking for the kinetic energy and assuming mass number is taken as sumnof protons and neutron mass, but here we'd better go with the accurate approach.

But since it ends that have to choose one, to explain, that is.

Therefore, the result would depend on how precise the rest mass is, and in lack of precise data, depending on assumptions.

Interestingly, given the required precision of 1e-4, and the calculation's answer resting heavily on proper inclusion of exact rest mass, but lacking a specified masd, perhaps the  use of approximate mass A=6 would be feasible. But question is from a student, therefore, expected steps.

Alternatively, check via via different approaches.

Speed is v=0.96c. For non-relativistic speeds, KE=0.5mv², but at 0.96c, relativistic effects are non-negligible.

First compute gamma, gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28≈3.5714.

Total energy E=gamma*m*c². KE=E - m c²=(gamma -1)m c².

So to get KE.

Dependent on rest mass.

As calculated, with accurate rest mass = Li-6 ≈6.015123u (given considering binding energy)

Using 6.015123u gives KE≈14,407.85 MeV, and using 6.00u gives ∼14,342 MeV? Did we compute that:

For m=6.0u:

E_rest =6*931.494 MeV=5,588.964 MeV.

KE=(gamma-1)*5,588.964=(25/7 -1)*5,588.964= (18/7)*5,588.964=18/7*5,588.964≈(2.5714285)*5,588.964≈14,371.62 MeV.

So, there is a difference of about 36 MeV between using A=6.0u and A=6.015123u.。

Naturally, professor would need to specify proper m.

Given that the problem statement is unclear.

But checking for Lithium bonds.

Given notably, in heavy ions, typically each ion is fully stripped, so charge state is +3 for Lithium. But does that matter for rest mass? No, because electrons have negligible mass compared to nucleons. So, charge state wouldn't affect rest mass significantly. Hence, approximating the nucleus mass as isotopic mass (without electrons) is appropriate.

As specified isotope is Li with 3 neutrons, it is Li-6. With isotopic mass 6.015123u.

Hence, real physics demands that calculation uses isotopic mass. Hence KE≈14,407.85 MeV.

But let us check with order of E_rest=5,603.0 MeV.

Then gamma ≈ 3.5714285.

Thus, E_total=gamma*m*c^2.

 The missing here in my first calculstion, presention.

But given that the h:mmUser hasn't given exact rest mass. Hence, ambiguity exists.

Hence, perhaps the answer can't be certain.That may be possible. However, ultimately, this seems parse.

As in most nice problems you are given the rest mass. Lack of data is a problem.

Alternatively, just gave the answer of (gamma -1) * A * u * c^2, assuming  elemental simplification of nucleons.

But perhaps presented calculation: "If we take the rest mass... then KE is total energy minus rest".

But detailing these considerations and therefore. Maybe that is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using classical formulae and requires just the kinetic energy via relativistic formulas. Also wrong. But perhaps even LCD for large speeds.

But giventhat the problem was likely expecting the formula for a relativistic kinetic energy:

K=(gamma -1)mc². Without considering if mass is Li-6 or approximate.

But in results, as per approximate mass ~6.0 u then K=(gamma-1)*6*u*c².

So given that part.

But gives it's (25/7 -1)*6 *931.494

Thus, 18/7 *6 *931.494= (108/7)*931.494≈15.428571 *931.494≈let's compute 15*931.494=13,972.41; 0.428571*931.494≈401. so total≈ 13,972.41 +401≈14,373.41 MeV.

So okay K≈14,373.4 MeV with approximate answer.

Question is if Li with 3 protons and 3 neutrons: sum masses.

But LacK specificity. Unless, as students are often told, in problem that provides data consistent but tells you not to use kept masses. But in conclusion, without isotopic mass, answer would have variations.

Hwever, most possible OLá, here whatdesneed tothe best way is to note the absence of data. However, the answer given in numerical rounded.

But fórum the given data, supposing rhwta's needed is to provide. Alternatively, the answer givenby my initial computation waS 14.4078 GeV. So about that. In exams嘴巴.

But to comply with tHe requested precision.

And end。


**Final Answer**
The energy of the RHIC is \boxed{14.4078} GeV.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should figure out what exactly the question is asking for. The energy here probably refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon or the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. Since RHIC is a particle accelerator, they likely mention the kinetic energy imparted to the nuclei. But I need to confirm that. Sometimes in physics, when talking about energy in colliders, they refer to the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But maybe in this context, it's the kinetic energy. Hmm. Wait, but let me recall. In accelerator physics, the energy is sometimes given as the kinetic energy per nucleon, especially for heavy ions. But I need to check. Let's assume that the problem wants the total kinetic energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c. But perhaps it's better to be precise.

So, Lithium with 3 neutrons. Lithium's atomic number is 3, so it has 3 protons. The standard isotope is Lithium-6 or Lithium-7. Adding 3 neutrons to Lithium... If it's regular Lithium with 3 neutrons, then the most common isotope is Lithium-6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons) but here it's specified as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, normal Lithium has varying isotopes. Lithium-7 has 4 neutrons. So if the nucleus is Lithium with 3 neutrons, that would be Lithium-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making the mass number 6. Okay, so the isotope here is Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. So each nucleus has 6 nucleons. The total rest mass would be the mass of Li-6 nucleus.

But in terms of calculations, maybe they want us to approximate using the atomic mass unit. Let's check: The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 u, and the neutron is 1.008665 u. The Li-6 nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. But the actual mass of Li-6 is less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy. However, maybe for the sake of this problem, we are to use the approximation where the mass is simply the sum of protons and neutrons. Or perhaps use the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me see. Since it's about the relativistic energy, which uses the rest mass, perhaps we need the exact rest mass. Alternatively, the question might just expect using the mass number times the atomic mass unit. Let me check the standard approach.

In many relativity problems, especially in exams or textbooks, when dealing with nuclei, they often approximate the rest mass as A times the atomic mass unit, u, where A is the mass number. Since each proton and neutron is approximately 1 u, so total mass would be about 6 u. But, for better precision, the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.015122887 u. But if I use 6.015122887 u or just 6 u, the difference might be significant? Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the rest mass is simply A times the proton mass. Wait, but protons and neutrons have almost the same mass. The difference might be negligible here given that 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make up 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) u. Let's compute this.

Protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u
Neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u
Total: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u

But the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.015123 u. So there's a difference of about 0.0327 u, which is due to the binding energy. But considering the precision required is 1e-4, which is four decimal places, this difference could be significant. Hence, maybe we need to use the actual mass of Li-6. Wait, but maybe in this problem, since they don't provide the exact mass, we are supposed to use approximate values. Alternatively, the mass number times the atomic mass unit. Since the problem statement doesn't specify, maybe we can assume that the rest mass is 6 u where 1 u is 931.494 MeV/c². Well, but even so, in high-energy physics, sometimes they just use A times the proton mass. But protons and neutrons have nearly the same mass, so maybe approximate the mass as A * u, where u is unified atomic mass unit.

Alternatively, we can calculate using the actual mass of Li-6, but perhaps without knowing the exact mass, how is that possible? Wait, maybe they just want us to use the sum of protons and neutrons mass (ignoring binding energy) or approximate as A * u. Since the problem statement doesn't provide exact mass, maybe it's okay to approximate the nuclear mass as 6 u, or 3*proton + 3*neutron.

But to check, let me recall: 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c². If we take the Li-6 nucleus as 6 u, then rest mass energy is 6 * 931.494 MeV ≈ 5588.964 MeV. But if we take the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, which we calculated as approximately 6.047823 u, so rest mass energy would be approximately 6.047823 * 931.494 ≈ 5632.78 MeV. The difference is about 43.81 MeV, which is significant. Wait, but is this necessary?

Given that the problem mentions "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which is 0.0001, which is four decimal places. Hmm. So 1e-4 relative precision. So when we compute gamma, we need to perform the calculations keeping enough decimal places. So, probably, it's essential to use the actual rest mass, but since the problem didn't give us the mass, we might need to approximate. Wait, in these types of problems, perhaps we are to use the mass number multiplied by the atomic mass unit, sometimes called the "atomic mass unit per nucleon," so that each nucleon contributes approximately 931.494 MeV/c² of rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest energy is just the number of nucleons (which is 6) multiplied by the energy equivalent of the atomic mass unit. 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c². Therefore, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 6 * 931.494 MeV. Therefore, rest energy E_rest = 6 * 931.494 MeV, which is approximately 5588.964 MeV. Then, given that speed v = 0.96c, we need to compute the total energy, which is gamma * E_rest, and then subtract the rest energy to get the kinetic energy. Wait, but the problem says "the energy of the RHIC". So is that kinetic energy or total energy?

In accelerator physics, the "energy" sometimes refers to the kinetic energy per nucleon. For example, RHIC collides heavy ions at 100 GeV per nucleon. But maybe in the question, the energy is the total kinetic energy. The problem is not explicit, so maybe it should be made clear. Hmm. The problem says "energy of the RHIC" which is ambiguous. But in the context, since they are colliding nuclei, the energy is typically given as kinetic energy per nucleon. Wait, but let me think again.

The problem states: "the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So we can calculate the total energy, which is gamma * m * c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m * c^2. So if "energy of RHIC" refers to the kinetic energy given to the nucleus, which would make sense, then the answer is (gamma - 1) * m * c².

But perhaps "energy" here is meant as total energy. Would need to check similar problems. However, standard terminology: in accelerators, kinetic energy is usually what's being referred to. For example, the LHC accelerates protons to 6.5 TeV of kinetic energy. Wait, no: actually, in the LHC, the "energy" is specified as the total energy. Because protons are relativistic and the kinetic energy is a significant fraction of the total energy. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me think again. For a particle moving at speed v, total energy is gamma*m*c^2 and kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)*m*c². Since RHIC accelerates particles to certain energies, it could be either. However, given that it says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c," I think they are referring to the kinetic energy, because if you set the speed, the total energy is gamma*m*c², but assuming that specifying the speed allows you to calculate the necessary kinetic energy imparted. Therefore, K = (gamma - 1)*m*c².

Alternatively, perhaps in the question, "energy of the RHIC" is given as the total energy. Let's see. Either way, I need to figure out based on standard terminology.

In particle physics, when we talk about the "beam energy," it can be ambiguous. But often, the term "beam energy" can refer to the kinetic energy per nucleon, especially for heavy ions. For example, RHIC is known to collide gold nuclei at 100 GeV per nucleon. So each nucleon has 100 GeV of kinetic energy. However, the problem here asks for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So since speed depends on the Lorentz factor, which is a function of the total energy, but if we are given the speed, then once we calculate gamma, we can find either total energy or kinetic energy. So maybe the answer is looking for the kinetic energy. Alternatively, gamma is just a factor, which the user has to compute for the given velocity.

Additionally, the problem mentions the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, so we need the mass of that nucleus to compute gamma, and then energy.

So the approach should be:

1. Determine the rest mass of the nucleus (Li-6).
2. Calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.
3. Use gamma to compute total energy (E_total = gamma * m * c²) or kinetic energy (K = (gamma - 1) * m * c²).
4. Express the result with the required precision.

But getting back to step 1: How do we calculate the rest mass?

Assuming that the problem allows approximate calculation with mass number:

But perhaps we can more precisely compute using the actual mass of Li-6. Let's find the exact mass.

The isotopic mass of Li-6 is 6.015122887 u (from the periodic table or nuclear data). So in atomic mass units, that's 6.015122887 u.

Alternatively, considering that the Li-6 nucleus is made up of 3 protons, 3 neutrons, and binding energy. But given that the isotope's mass is given as 6.015122887 u, which is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons (which is 6.047823 u as calculated earlier). Therefore, the nuclear binding energy has resulted in a mass reduction.

But to calculate relativistic energy, perhaps we should use the actual rest mass of the nucleus. However, the problem does not provide that information, so maybe it expects us to approximate, for example, using A = 6 with m = 6*u.

Alternatively, since Lithium has atomic number 3, but if the nucleus is Lithium with 3 neutrons, it's Li-6. Let's go with that isotopic mass. So, Li-6 mass is 6.015122887 u.

But given that the required answer has a precision of 1e-4, then maybe 1e-4 of what? If the energy is in MeV, then four decimal places would be thousandths of an MeV. Wait, 1e-4 of 1 MeV is 0.0001 MeV = 100 eV precision. That's possible.

So to compute accurately, let's use the exact isotopic mass:

Mass of Li-6 nucleus: 6.015122887 u.

But given that the problem does not provide this value, perhaps we can represent it algebraically. But wait, sometimes protons and neutrons are given as approximate if the problem does not specify exact mass. Alternatively, the problem expects us to use the mass number multiplied by 1 u. Wait, but according to standard physics, the rest mass of a nucleus is not exactly mass number times 1 u. But for simplicity, if they don't give the exact value, maybe we can assume A = 6, m = 6 u. Let's make that assumption unless told otherwise. So m = 6 * u.

But given that even with that, there's the uncertainty. Hmm. Since the problem statement didn't specify the mass but just says "X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons," perhaps it's Li-6. But even so, without the precise isotopic mass, perhaps we need to use a certain approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of computing gamma, the exact mass isn't necessary. Wait, no, because K = (gamma - 1)*m*c². So if the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, it is directly proportional to m. Therefore, a different mass would lead to a different kinetic energy.

Therefore, given that the problem requires a precise answer (to 1e-4), perhaps the actual rest mass is required. However, since the problem does not provide it, perhaps there is a different approach. Wait, but Lithium with 3 protons and 3 neutrons is Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015123 u. So let's proceed with that. To find this mass in kg:

1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg

Therefore, m = 6.015122887 u * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/u ≈ 6.015122887 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Wait, but if we are working in natural units where c=1, maybe we can compute directly in units of MeV/c².

But 1 u = 931.49410242 MeV/c². So m = 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/(c²·u) ≈ 6.015122887 * 931.49410242 MeV/c² ≈ let's compute this.

First, let's compute 6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452 MeV/c².

Then 0.015122887 * 931.49410242 ≈

Let's compute 0.01 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242
0.005122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ ?

Compute 0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121
0.000122887 * 931.4941 ≈ 0.000122887 * 931.4941 ≈ approximately 0.114564 (exact computation: 0.000122887 * 931.4941). Let's do it step by step:

0.0001 * 931.4941 ≈ 0.09314941
0.000022887 * 931.4941 ≈ 0.000022887 * 931.4941 ≈ 0.0213046

So total ≈ 0.09314941 + 0.0213046 ≈ 0.114454.

Therefore, 0.005122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 4.6574705121 + 0.114454 ≈ 4.7719245

Thus, 0.015122887 * 931.4941 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.7719245 ≈ 14.0868655

Therefore, total mass energy:

5588.96461452 + 14.0868655 ≈ 5603.05148 MeV/c²

So, m = approximately 5603.05148 MeV/c².

Wait, but let me check this with a calculator perhaps for better precision. Alternatively, let's compute 6.015122887 * 931.49410242:

First, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452

0.015122887 * 931.49410242:

Compute 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122887 * 931.49410242:

Express 0.005122887 as 5.122887e-3

5e-3 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.122887e-3 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.122887 * 0.93149410242 ≈ 0.11456

Adding to 4.6574705121 + 0.11456 ≈ 4.77203

Then total 9.3149410242 + 4.77203 ≈ 14.08697

Therefore, total m = 5588.96461452 + 14.08697 ≈ 5603.05158 MeV/c²

So approximately 5603.0516 MeV/c².

So rest mass energy E_rest = 5603.0516 MeV.

Given that v = 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²)

0.96² = 0.9216

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28

Therefore, gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714286

But let me compute it precisely:

sqrt(0.0784) = sqrt(784/10000) = sqrt(784)/100 = 28/100 = 0.28

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.5714285714

Therefore, gamma ≈ 3.5714285714

Therefore, total energy E_total = gamma * m * c² = gamma * E_rest ≈ 3.5714285714 * 5603.0516 MeV ≈ let's compute!

3 * 5603.0516 = 16809.1548

0.5714285714 * 5603.0516 ≈

0.5 * 5603.0516 = 2801.5258

0.0714285714 * 5603.0516 ≈ (1/14) * 5603.0516 ≈ 5603.0516 / 14 ≈ 400.21797

So total 0.5714285714 * 5603.0516 ≈ 2801.5258 + 400.21797 ≈ 3201.74377

Therefore, E_total ≈ 16809.1548 + 3201.74377 ≈ 20010.8986 MeV

So, E_total ≈ 20010.8986 MeV.

Then, kinetic energy K = E_total - E_rest ≈ 20010.8986 - 5603.0516 ≈ 14407.847 MeV

So, approximately 14407.847 MeV.

But the problem says, "the energy of the RHIC". Since this is the kinetic energy, approximately 14,407.85 MeV, which is 14.40785 GeV. Wait, 14,407.85 MeV is 14.40785 GeV. But in heavy ion colliders, energies are often given per nucleon. The rest mass energy per nucleon for Li-6 is 5603.0516 MeV /6 ≈ 933.8419 MeV per nucleon.

But the kinetic energy per nucleon would be 14,407.85 MeV /6 ≈ 2401.308 MeV or 2.401308 GeV per nucleon. But maybe the problem is asking for the total kinetic energy of the nucleus. If so, it's about 14.40785 GeV. But the problem doesn't specify per nucleon, so perhaps it's the total.

However, in practice, RHIC and other accelerators typically specify energy per nucleon. For example, the RHIC can collide heavy ion

Let me analyze the situation regarding the RHIC's energy requirements for a Lithium-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c. Lithium-6 consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it a nucleus with mass number 6. When considering nuclear masses, we could use the exact isotopic mass of Li-6, which is 6.015122887 atomic mass units, or approximate it as 6 atomic mass units. Since the problem doesn't provide the exact mass, we might need to use the approximation of 6 atomic mass units.

Converting atomic mass units to energy units, where 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c², the rest mass energy would be approximately 5588.964 MeV. However, using the more precise mass of 6.015122887 u gives us about 5603.0516 MeV for the rest mass energy.

For a particle moving at 0.96c, we can calculate the Lorentz factor gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²) ≈ 3.5714285714. Using this gamma factor and the rest mass energy, we can determine both the total energy (gamma * rest energy) and kinetic energy ((gamma - 1) * rest energy).

The total energy comes to approximately 20010.8986 MeV, and subtracting the rest energy gives us a kinetic energy of about 14407.847 MeV or 14.40785 GeV. However, in accelerator physics, energies are often specified per nucleon. The kinetic energy per nucleon would be approximately 2401.308 MeV or 2.401308 GeV.

The question of whether the problem asks for total kinetic energy or kinetic energy per nucleon is crucial, as accelerator facilities typically specify their energies per nucleon when dealing with heavy ions. However, since the problem asks for "the energy of the RHIC" without specifying per nucleon, it might be referring to the total kinetic energy of the nucleus.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is lithium with three neutrons, so I'll break this down step by step.

Firstly, let's clarify what the question is asking. The energy likely refers to the kinetic energy of the nucleus or per nucleon since RHIC is a particle accelerator. Sometimes, in physics, total energy, including rest mass energy, is considered, but here it might be kinetic energy. In accelerator physics, they often mention kinetic energy per nucleon, especially with heavy ions. Nevertheless, let's assume the problem needs the total kinetic energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c.

For Lithium with three neutrons: Lithium’s atomic number is 3, with three protons. Standard isotopes are Lithium-6 and -7. Regular Lithium with three neutrons refers to Lithium-6, which has three protons and three neutrons with a mass number of 6, yielding six nucleons. Thus, the rest mass is the Li-6 nucleus mass.

For calculations, they might want us to use atomic mass units. The proton has about 1.007276 u, and the neutron 1.008665 u. Li-6 has three protons and three neutrons, but its actual mass is less due to binding energy. We might be expected to sum protons and neutrons for an approximate mass or use the atomic mass of Li-6. Since relativistic energy needs rest mass, an exact rest mass could be required. Sometimes, they use the mass number times the atomic mass unit. In many physics problems, they approximate rest mass as mass number A times atomic mass unit, equating to 6 u, but the actual mass is 6.015122887 u, resulting in a minor difference.

Alternatively, the problem may assume rest mass as A times proton mass, yet protons and neutrons are nearly the same mass, so A * u for approximation works. Calculating:

Protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u

Neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u

Total: 6.047823 u versus actual Li-6 mass of 6.015123 u, indicating a 0.0327 u difference due to binding energy, possibly significant within high precision requirements. Hence, we'll use Li-6's actual mass in calculations if demanded.

Rest energy per the atomic mass unit is 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c². Assuming Li-6 is 6 u, then rest mass energy is 6 * 931.494 MeV ≈ 5588.96 MeV. Total rest mass using sum calculations equals approximately 5632.78 MeV, with about 43.81 MeV difference, potentially significant. However, precision to 1e-4 requires cautious consideration here.

Now, to solve for the whole step-by-step process:
1. Identify rest mass of the nucleus (Li-6).
2. Compute gamma for v = 0.96c.
3. With gamma, determine total energy (E_total = gamma * m * c²) or kinetic energy (K = (gamma - 1) * m * c²).
4. Provide results with specified precision.

Calculating gamma and energy:
- Gamma factor: 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) ≈ 3.5714
- Total energy: gamma * rest mass energy, with K = (gamma - 1) * m * c² needed for kinetic energy.

Ultimately, K ≈ 14,407.85 MeV, equivalent to 14.40785 GeV for total kinetic energy.

With RHIC, energies are often per nucleon: total kinetic energy is divided by nucleons, yielding energy per nucleon. Hence, the kinetic energy calculation achieves the desired speed and establishes RHIC's energy for 0.96c speed. But here's the ambiguity: specific to kinetic energy intended. Therefore, the assumed total approach holds true unless alternative specified.

But here, the answer is 2.4 GeV per nucleon? Wait, that seems low. Wait, but if you accelerate ions to 0.96c, the gamma is about 3.57, so the kinetic energy per nucleon is (gamma -1) * m_nucleon * c². If we are using m_nucleon = 938 MeV/c² (average for proton and neutron), then KE per nucleon = (3.57 -1 ) * 938 ≈ 2.57 * 938 ≈ 2411 MeV per nucleon, which is ~2.4 GeV per nucleon. That aligns with above calculation. But if the problem expects the total kinetic energy for the nucleus, that\'s 14.4 GeV. But I need to see, since the problem states "the energy of the RHIC". Typically, when people refer to the energy of the collider, they refer to the energy per nucleon in the case of heavy ions. For example, RHIC is often cited as 100 GeV per nucleon.\n\nBut in this case, if we don\'t know whether it\'s per nucleon or total, how can we answer? The question is ambiguous. Maybe I can state both. However, looking back at the problem statement, since the question is giving the speed of the nucleus, not per nucleon, and is asking for the energy of RHIC, likely the total energy of the nucleus. Wait, no, because each nucleus would have a certain total energy. However, accelerators require knowing the energy per nucleon because different ions have different numbers of nucleons. But perhaps here, the question simply wants the kinetic energy of the nucleus, given that it is moving at 0.96c.\n\nBut let\'s re-examine the problem:\n\n"What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"\n\n"Knowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons."\n\n"PS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4."\n\nHmm. The term "energy of the RHIC" is unclear. However, logically, since RHIC accelerates nuclei to certain energies, each nucleus will have a certain kinetic energy. Thus, likely, ask for the kinetic energy per nucleus. Therefore, in that case, we need to find K = (gamma - 1) * m * c^2, with m being the rest mass of the nucleus.\n\nGiven our calculation for Li-6, we found K ≈ 14407.85 MeV.\n\nBut the problem requires the precision of the energy at 1e-4. Thus, 4 decimal places. In the calculation of K, the value is approximately 14407.847 MeV. Depending on precise gamma and rest mass, we need to verify. Let\'s compute gamma more accurately:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²)\n\nCompute 1 - 0.96²:\n\n0.96^2 = (24/25)^2 = 576/625 = 0.9216\n\nHence, 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784\n\nsqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, as mentioned before. Therefore, gamma = 1/0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.571428571428571...\n\nThus, gamma is exact as a fraction: 25/7. Therefore, no precision loss here.\n\nThe rest mass E_rest was computed as ~5603.05158 MeV. To get precise E_rest, I need the precise calculation of 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c² per u.\n\nLet me compute this product with high precision.\n\nFirst, 6.015122887 * 931.49410242.\n\nBreak it into parts:\n\n6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452\n\n0.015122887 * 931.49410242:\n\nFirst, 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242\n\n0.005122887 * 931.49410242:\n\nBreak 0.005122887 into 5.122887e-3\n\n5e-3 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121\n\nNow, 0.122887e-3 * 931.49410242 = 0.000122887 * 931.49410242\n\nCompute 0.0001 * 931.49410242 = 0.093149410242\n\n0.000022887 * 931.49410242:\n\n= 0.00002 * 931.49410242 = 0.0186298820484\n\n+ 0.000002887 * 931.49410242\n\n0.000002887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.0026884146\n\nThus, 0.0186298820484 + 0.0026884146 ≈ 0.0213182966\n\nTotal for 0.000122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.093149410242 + 0.0213182966 ≈ 0.11446770684\n\nHence, 0.005122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 4.6574705121 + 0.11446770684 ≈ 4.77193821894\n\nTherefore, 0.015122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.77193821894 ≈ 14.0868792431\n\nAdding to the 6*931.49410242: 5588.96461452 + 14.0868792431 ≈ 5603.05149376 MeV\n\nTherefore, E_rest ≈ 5603.05149376 MeV\n\nThus, this is an exact enough calculation. Now, moving to K = (gamma -1)*E_rest. gamma -1 = 25/7 -1 = 18/7 ≈ 2.57142857142857...\n\nThus, K = (18/7) * 5603.05149376 MeV ≈ (18/7)*5603.05149376\n\nCompute 5603.05149376 /7 ≈ 800.43592768\n\nMultiply by 18:\n\n800.43592768 * 10 = 8004.3592768\n\n800.43592768 * 8 = 6403.48742144\n\nAdding these: 8004.3592768 + 6403.48742144 = 14407.8466982 MeV\n\nSo K ≈ 14407.8467 MeV, which rounds to 14407.8467 MeV. With the required precision of 1e-4, which is 0.0001, meaning we need four decimal places. But in MeV, that would be 14407.8467 MeV. However, expressed in what unit? If they want the answer in MeV, then 14407.8467 MeV with four decimal places is 14407.8467 MeV. But given the context, GeV might be more standard for such energies. However, converting, 14407.8467 MeV is 14.4078467 GeV, which would be 14.4078 GeV when rounded to four decimal places. Hmm, 14.4078 GeV.\n\nBut checking again with accurate calculation, the exact answer is (25/7 - 1) * 5603.05149376\n\nWait that\'s (18/7) * 5603.05149376\n\n18 * 5603.05149376 = 100854.926888\n\nThen divided by 7: 100854.926888 /7 = 14407.8466983\n\nHence, K =14407.8467 MeV.\n\nBut writing that with four decimal places: 14407.8467 MeV. If converted to GeV, it\'s 14.4078467 GeV. Depending on what unit is desired. The problem says "energy of the RHIC", and RHIC typically uses GeV or TeV. Given that the answer is about 14.4 GeV, unless converted into another unit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants the answer in terms of energy per nucleon.\n\nTotal kinetic energy is 14,407.8467 MeV, divided by 6 nucleons, is 2401.30778 MeV per nucleon, which is 2.40130778 GeV per nucleon, rounded to four decimal places, 2.4013 GeV/u.\n\nBut again, the problem does not specify per nucleon, so perhaps the total kinetic energy of the nucleus is the answer.\n\nBut given that RHIC is a heavy ion collider and usually energies are given per nucleon, but the problem specifies the speed of the nucleus, so maybe the answer is the total kinetic energy. But without further information, it\'s ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, if we think that the problem meant to have the total energy, being gamma*m*c^2, which would be 20010.8986 MeV (approx. 20 GeV). But that seems high. However, total energy is also a definition. But no, in accelerator physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, they most often refer to the kinetic energy. So kinetic energy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even using the lab frame energy, but that is unclear. But given that the speed is given, and in the problem\'s phrasing, "the energy of RHIC so that the speed..." then energy here refers to kinetic energy required for the nucleus to reach that speed. Therefore, my conclusion is that the answer is 14,407.8467 MeV, which is 14.4078 GeV with the required precision. But 14,407.8467 MeV can be written as 14407.8467 MeV, and as per the problem statement, the precision is 1e-4, which would correspond to 14407.8467 MeV. Since 1e-4 *14407.8467 ≈ 1.4407 MeV. So decimal precision?\n\nWait, the precision of the energy is at 1e-4. That usually refers to a relative precision. If absolute precision, meaning four decimal places in whatever the unit is. If the answer is in MeV, then to 1e-4 MeV, but 1e-4 MeV is 100 eV, implying we need at least 0.0001 MeV precision. But in our result, K is 14407.8467 MeV (14,407.8467), which has four decimal places (even though the value is big). Alternatively, the problem may require the result in Joules? Unlikely in the context, since in particle physics energy is more commonly in eV.\n\nAlternatively, if first convert the energy to Joules, just in case, but likely not. Since using eV natural. If the problem wants it in eV with specified precision, what is it? For instance, from the calculation, the kinetic energy is approximately 14,407.85 MeV, which is 1.440785 ×10^10 eV. So if written as 14.4078 GeV, so four decimal places would be 14.4078 GeV. Alternatively, written in MeV: 14407.8467 MeV. Either way, to match 1e-4 precision.\n\nBut convert 5603.05149376 MeV * 18 /7 = K.\n\nBut Let me check with precise calculation again to confirm:\n\nm = 6.015122887 u\n\nCompute E_rest = 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV / u = let\'s compute 6.015122887 * 931.49410242:\n\nBreakdown:\n\nFirst, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452\n\n0.015122887 * 931.49410242 = ?\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step.\n\nMultiply 0.015122887 * 931.49410242:\n\nFirstly, 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242\n\n0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121\n\n0.000122887 * 931.49410242:\n\n0.0001 * 931.49410242 = 0.093149410242\n\n0.000022887 * 931.49410242:\n\n0.00002 * 931.49410242 = 0.0186298820484\n\n0.000002887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.0026884146 as before.\n\nTotal for 0.000022887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.0186298820484 + 0.0026884146 ≈ 0.0213182966\n\nThus, 0.0001 * rest is 0.093149410242 + 0.0213182966 ≈ 0.1144677068\n\nThen, 0.015122887 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242 + 4.6574705121 + 0.1144677068 ≈ sum as:\n\n9.3149410242 + 4.6574705121 = 13.9724115363 + 0.1144677068 ≈ 14.0868792431 MeV.\n\nThus, total E_rest = 5588.96461452 +14.0868792431 ≈ 5603.05149376 MeV, confirming again.\n\nThen gamma = 25/7 ≈3.5714285714.\n\nThus, gamma -1 =18/7 =2.5714285714.\n\nK= (gamma -1)*E_rest =18/7 *5603.05149376= 14407.8466983 MeV\n\nTherefore, K≈ 14407.8467 MeV\n\nRounding to four decimal places as 14407.8467 MeV.\n\nIn GeV, that\'s 14.4078467 GeV, so 14.4078 GeV when rounded to four decimal places.\n\nBut depending on what units the problem expects. Considering RHIC\'s energy is usually referenced in GeV per nucleon, but since the problem says "speed of the nucleus", not per nucleon, and doesn\'t specify per nucleon, then the total kinetic energy is the answer. But to convert to joules if required, how? Probably not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 14407.8467 MeV or 14.4078 GeV. The user might expect the answer in GeV as it is customary. Additionally, precise to 1e-4 in the given unit. Probably, if written as GeV with four decimal places.\n\nThus, 14.4078 GeV.\n\nWait, let\'s check:\n\n14407.8467 MeV\n\nTo GeV: 14.4078467 GeV\n\nRounded to four decimal places: 14.4078 GeV. But the actual value is 14.4078467.... So at the fourth decimal: 14.4078 (since the next digit is 4, which is less than 5).\n\nBut doing the maths:\n\n14.4078467.... Check:\n\nPosition: 14.4078\n\nDigits:\n\n1: 1 (1)\n2: 4 (2)\n3: 4 (3)\n4: 0 (4)\n5: 7 (5)\n6: 8 (6)\nThen after decimal: 4, so fourth decimal place is the 8th digit. Wait, sorry. The number is 14.4078467 GeV. Let\'s count the decimal places:\n\n1: 4 (tenths)\n2: 0 (hundredths)\n3: 7 (thousandths)\n4: 8 (ten-thousandths)\n5: 4 (hundred-thousandths)\n6: 6 (millionths)\n7: 7 (ten-millionths)\nSo "14.4078467" has seven decimal places, but we need to round to four. The fourth decimal is the 8. The next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we keep the fourth decimal as is. Therefore, 14.4078 GeV.\n\nAlternatively, if the answer is required in MeV, as 14407.8467 MeV, which is already to four decimal places (with the decimal at the MeV position, i.e., 14407.8467 MeV is 1.44078467 ×10^4 MeV expressing four decimal digits.)\n\nBut when precision of 1e-4 is required, which is 0.0001 relative to the value, then 14407.8467 already meets 1e-4 as the error would be ±0.0001 *14407.8467≈1.4408 MeV. But if the question is asking for absolute precision 1e-4 in energy units, which is in what? The unit isn\'t specified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the rest mass in atomic mass units. But no, energy.\n\nWait the user mentions "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". Maybe 1e-4 in the same unit. For example, in GeV: 0.0001 GeV = 0.1 MeV. So twelve中的precision vs. actual value of about 14.4078 GeV.\n\nBut significant figures? If so, perhaps it\'s required to have four significant figures? But the value given would already to have that, 14407.85 MeV is 14,407.85 MeV where four significant figures are 1, 4, 4, and 0 (since the comma is for thousands). Wait, no. The significant figures in 14407.85 are six digits. If they want four significant figures, it would be 1.440 ×10^4 MeV (14,400 MeV). Hmm. But due to the note "precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which maybe absolute precision of 0.0001 GeV, i.e., 0.1 MeV.\n\nWait, the confusion here is due to not knowing the units. If the answer is in GeV, then 1e-4 GeV is 0.0001 GeV = 100 MeV, but in such case, rounding to nearest 0.0001 GeV would give an error of up to 0.00005 GeV = 50 MeV. But need to see the questioner\'s intent.\n\nBut given the answer derived earlier, 14.4078 GeV, or 14407.8 MeV, but rounded is as close as possible given the information. If we follow strict four decimal places, howsoever, if written in GeV, the answer is 14.4078 GeV.\n\nBut maybe in order to make sure, given that the user might need the answer in MeV, there\'s no unit specified.\n\nThe link prompt says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So depends if it\'s relative or absolute. If it\'s relative precision, 0.01% (i.e., 0.0001 relative error).\n\nIn that case, we need to compute the error to be less than 0.01% of the computed energy.\n\nHowever, the computation was done assuming the exact value of gamma (25/7 exactly) and mass (as per exact isotopic composition). Thus, assuming that, in format +/- 0.0001 in some unit. Hence, perhaps the given value in box would like to be either the Total Energy ( gamma*mc² ) or Kinetic Energy ( (gamma-1)*mc² ), but given the answer above for kinetic energy in MeV is 14407.8467 MeV, which we could write as 14407.8467 MeV. For one e-4 precision, 0.0001 in MeV would be keV-level, but with 14407.8467 MeV, that\'s 14407.8467 MeV = 14,407,846.7 keV.\n\nSo, converting between units is maybe complicating. Alternatively, given the context of RHIC, where typically in GeV as per earlier references.\n\nWait, but given the PS specifies "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", likely relative, so 1e-4 is 0.01% relative uncertainty. But in our previous calculation we have a precise exact gamma (math done with infinite precision) and the rest mass is taken exactly as 6.015122887 u. So the question is, do we have to consider realistic uncertainties? But given that the problem didn’t provide rest mass details, and implicitly wants us to proceed assuming certain exact values, so our answer, if precise to machine precision, theoretically would suffice.\n\nIn conclusion, given the problem requirements, we are to find the kinetic energy of the Li-6 nucleus accelerated to 0.96c. Given gamma and E_rest as calculated, the kinetic energy is K = (25/7 -1) * 5603.05149376 MeV = 14407.8467 MeV. To four decimal places as the PS requires, we can write as 14407.8467 MeV.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps given in joules, but given unit conversions:\n\n1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J, so 14407.8467 MeV =14.4078467 GeV =14.4078467e9 eV =1.44078467e10 eV.\n\nThus, K =1.44078467e10 eV *1.60218e-19 J/eV ≈2.307e-9 J.\n\nBut very small number and in high energy physics natural units are eV.\n\nBut I think given the PS提示precision 1e-4 implies that the numeric answer should have at least four decimal places. So the options are 14407.8467 MeV or 14.4078 GeV. Since the problem does not specify the unit, but in the context of RHIC, GeV is appropriate.\n\nThus the answer is 14.4078 GeV. Therefore, in a box, the answer is \\boxed{14.4078} GeV.\n\nBut it\'s always better to check units. But alternatively, to add GeV to box. But based on intro, are we supposed to box just numerical value. In many cases, if problem mentions units in the question, sometimes just the number is required. But corr不work.\n\nSo concluding, converting from the kinetic energy, we have approxiamately 14.4078467 GeV ≈14.4078 GeV. So the answer is 14.4078 GeV with the given precision. Therefore, I will box this.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy of the RHIC is \\boxed{14.4078} GeV.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1741248006, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5347, prompt_tokens=4486, total_tokens=9833, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Lithium-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we follow these steps:

1. **Determine the rest mass of the Lithium-6 nucleus:**
   - Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.
   - The isotopic mass of Li-6 is 6.015122887 atomic mass units (u).
   - Convert this mass to energy using \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.49410242 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):
     \[
     E_{\text{rest}} = 6.015122887 \, \text{u} \times 931.49410242 \, \text{MeV}/\text{u} \approx 5603.0515 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (γ) for speed \(v = 0.96c\):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
   \]

3. **Calculate the total energy (E_total) and kinetic energy (K) of the nucleus:**
   - Total energy:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma \times E_{\text{rest}} \approx 3.5714 \times 5603.0515 \, \text{MeV} \approx 20010.8986 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - Kinetic energy:
     \[
     K = E_{\text{total}} - E_{\text{rest}} \approx 20010.8986 \, \text{MeV} - 5603.0515 \, \text{MeV} \approx 14407.8471 \, \text{MeV}
     \]

4. **Convert the kinetic energy to GeV and ensure precision:**
   - Convert MeV to GeV:
     \[
     14407.8471 \, \text{MeV} = 14.4078471 \, \text{GeV}
     \]
   - Round to four decimal places as required:
     \[
     14.4078 \, \text{GeV}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The energy of the RHIC is \boxed{14.4078} GeV.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

 beams at 100 GeV per nucleon. But here, the answer is 2.4 GeV per nucleon? Wait, that seems low. Wait, but if you accelerate ions to 0.96c, the gamma is about 3.57, so the kinetic energy per nucleon is (gamma -1) * m_nucleon * c². If we are using m_nucleon = 938 MeV/c² (average for proton and neutron), then KE per nucleon = (3.57 -1 ) * 938 ≈ 2.57 * 938 ≈ 2411 MeV per nucleon, which is ~2.4 GeV per nucleon. That aligns with above calculation. But if the problem expects the total kinetic energy for the nucleus, that's 14.4 GeV. But I need to see, since the problem states "the energy of the RHIC". Typically, when people refer to the energy of the collider, they refer to the energy per nucleon in the case of heavy ions. For example, RHIC is often cited as 100 GeV per nucleon.

But in this case, if we don't know whether it's per nucleon or total, how can we answer? The question is ambiguous. Maybe I can state both. However, looking back at the problem statement, since the question is giving the speed of the nucleus, not per nucleon, and is asking for the energy of RHIC, likely the total energy of the nucleus. Wait, no, because each nucleus would have a certain total energy. However, accelerators require knowing the energy per nucleon because different ions have different numbers of nucleons. But perhaps here, the question simply wants the kinetic energy of the nucleus, given that it is moving at 0.96c.

But let's re-examine the problem:

"What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

"Knowing that X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons."

"PS: the precision of the energy is at 1e-4."

Hmm. The term "energy of the RHIC" is unclear. However, logically, since RHIC accelerates nuclei to certain energies, each nucleus will have a certain kinetic energy. Thus, likely, ask for the kinetic energy per nucleus. Therefore, in that case, we need to find K = (gamma - 1) * m * c^2, with m being the rest mass of the nucleus.

Given our calculation for Li-6, we found K ≈ 14407.85 MeV.

But the problem requires the precision of the energy at 1e-4. Thus, 4 decimal places. In the calculation of K, the value is approximately 14407.847 MeV. Depending on precise gamma and rest mass, we need to verify. Let's compute gamma more accurately:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²)

Compute 1 - 0.96²:

0.96^2 = (24/25)^2 = 576/625 = 0.9216

Hence, 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, as mentioned before. Therefore, gamma = 1/0.28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.571428571428571...

Thus, gamma is exact as a fraction: 25/7. Therefore, no precision loss here.

The rest mass E_rest was computed as ~5603.05158 MeV. To get precise E_rest, I need the precise calculation of 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV/c² per u.

Let me compute this product with high precision.

First, 6.015122887 * 931.49410242.

Break it into parts:

6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452

0.015122887 * 931.49410242:

First, 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005122887 * 931.49410242:

Break 0.005122887 into 5.122887e-3

5e-3 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

Now, 0.122887e-3 * 931.49410242 = 0.000122887 * 931.49410242

Compute 0.0001 * 931.49410242 = 0.093149410242

0.000022887 * 931.49410242:

= 0.00002 * 931.49410242 = 0.0186298820484

+ 0.000002887 * 931.49410242

0.000002887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.0026884146

Thus, 0.0186298820484 + 0.0026884146 ≈ 0.0213182966

Total for 0.000122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.093149410242 + 0.0213182966 ≈ 0.11446770684

Hence, 0.005122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 4.6574705121 + 0.11446770684 ≈ 4.77193821894

Therefore, 0.015122887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 9.3149410242 + 4.77193821894 ≈ 14.0868792431

Adding to the 6*931.49410242: 5588.96461452 + 14.0868792431 ≈ 5603.05149376 MeV

Therefore, E_rest ≈ 5603.05149376 MeV

Thus, this is an exact enough calculation. Now, moving to K = (gamma -1)*E_rest. gamma -1 = 25/7 -1 = 18/7 ≈ 2.57142857142857...

Thus, K = (18/7) * 5603.05149376 MeV ≈ (18/7)*5603.05149376

Compute 5603.05149376 /7 ≈ 800.43592768

Multiply by 18:

800.43592768 * 10 = 8004.3592768

800.43592768 * 8 = 6403.48742144

Adding these: 8004.3592768 + 6403.48742144 = 14407.8466982 MeV

So K ≈ 14407.8467 MeV, which rounds to 14407.8467 MeV. With the required precision of 1e-4, which is 0.0001, meaning we need four decimal places. But in MeV, that would be 14407.8467 MeV. However, expressed in what unit? If they want the answer in MeV, then 14407.8467 MeV with four decimal places is 14407.8467 MeV. But given the context, GeV might be more standard for such energies. However, converting, 14407.8467 MeV is 14.4078467 GeV, which would be 14.4078 GeV when rounded to four decimal places. Hmm, 14.4078 GeV.

But checking again with accurate calculation, the exact answer is (25/7 - 1) * 5603.05149376

Wait that's (18/7) * 5603.05149376

18 * 5603.05149376 = 100854.926888

Then divided by 7: 100854.926888 /7 = 14407.8466983

Hence, K =14407.8467 MeV.

But writing that with four decimal places: 14407.8467 MeV. If converted to GeV, it's 14.4078467 GeV. Depending on what unit is desired. The problem says "energy of the RHIC", and RHIC typically uses GeV or TeV. Given that the answer is about 14.4 GeV, unless converted into another unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the answer in terms of energy per nucleon.

Total kinetic energy is 14,407.8467 MeV, divided by 6 nucleons, is 2401.30778 MeV per nucleon, which is 2.40130778 GeV per nucleon, rounded to four decimal places, 2.4013 GeV/u.

But again, the problem does not specify per nucleon, so perhaps the total kinetic energy of the nucleus is the answer.

But given that RHIC is a heavy ion collider and usually energies are given per nucleon, but the problem specifies the speed of the nucleus, so maybe the answer is the total kinetic energy. But without further information, it's ambiguous.

Alternatively, if we think that the problem meant to have the total energy, being gamma*m*c^2, which would be 20010.8986 MeV (approx. 20 GeV). But that seems high. However, total energy is also a definition. But no, in accelerator physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, they most often refer to the kinetic energy. So kinetic energy.

Alternatively, maybe even using the lab frame energy, but that is unclear. But given that the speed is given, and in the problem's phrasing, "the energy of RHIC so that the speed..." then energy here refers to kinetic energy required for the nucleus to reach that speed. Therefore, my conclusion is that the answer is 14,407.8467 MeV, which is 14.4078 GeV with the required precision. But 14,407.8467 MeV can be written as 14407.8467 MeV, and as per the problem statement, the precision is 1e-4, which would correspond to 14407.8467 MeV. Since 1e-4 *14407.8467 ≈ 1.4407 MeV. So decimal precision?

Wait, the precision of the energy is at 1e-4. That usually refers to a relative precision. If absolute precision, meaning four decimal places in whatever the unit is. If the answer is in MeV, then to 1e-4 MeV, but 1e-4 MeV is 100 eV, implying we need at least 0.0001 MeV precision. But in our result, K is 14407.8467 MeV (14,407.8467), which has four decimal places (even though the value is big). Alternatively, the problem may require the result in Joules? Unlikely in the context, since in particle physics energy is more commonly in eV.

Alternatively, if first convert the energy to Joules, just in case, but likely not. Since using eV natural. If the problem wants it in eV with specified precision, what is it? For instance, from the calculation, the kinetic energy is approximately 14,407.85 MeV, which is 1.440785 ×10^10 eV. So if written as 14.4078 GeV, so four decimal places would be 14.4078 GeV. Alternatively, written in MeV: 14407.8467 MeV. Either way, to match 1e-4 precision.

But convert 5603.05149376 MeV * 18 /7 = K.

But Let me check with precise calculation again to confirm:

m = 6.015122887 u

Compute E_rest = 6.015122887 u * 931.49410242 MeV / u = let's compute 6.015122887 * 931.49410242:

Breakdown:

First, 6 * 931.49410242 = 5588.96461452

0.015122887 * 931.49410242 = ?

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

Multiply 0.015122887 * 931.49410242:

Firstly, 0.01 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242

0.005 * 931.49410242 = 4.6574705121

0.000122887 * 931.49410242:

0.0001 * 931.49410242 = 0.093149410242

0.000022887 * 931.49410242:

0.00002 * 931.49410242 = 0.0186298820484

0.000002887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.0026884146 as before.

Total for 0.000022887 * 931.49410242 ≈ 0.0186298820484 + 0.0026884146 ≈ 0.0213182966

Thus, 0.0001 * rest is 0.093149410242 + 0.0213182966 ≈ 0.1144677068

Then, 0.015122887 * 931.49410242 = 9.3149410242 + 4.6574705121 + 0.1144677068 ≈ sum as:

9.3149410242 + 4.6574705121 = 13.9724115363 + 0.1144677068 ≈ 14.0868792431 MeV.

Thus, total E_rest = 5588.96461452 +14.0868792431 ≈ 5603.05149376 MeV, confirming again.

Then gamma = 25/7 ≈3.5714285714.

Thus, gamma -1 =18/7 =2.5714285714.

K= (gamma -1)*E_rest =18/7 *5603.05149376= 14407.8466983 MeV

Therefore, K≈ 14407.8467 MeV

Rounding to four decimal places as 14407.8467 MeV.

In GeV, that's 14.4078467 GeV, so 14.4078 GeV when rounded to four decimal places.

But depending on what units the problem expects. Considering RHIC's energy is usually referenced in GeV per nucleon, but since the problem says "speed of the nucleus", not per nucleon, and doesn't specify per nucleon, then the total kinetic energy is the answer. But to convert to joules if required, how? Probably not.

Therefore, the answer is 14407.8467 MeV or 14.4078 GeV. The user might expect the answer in GeV as it is customary. Additionally, precise to 1e-4 in the given unit. Probably, if written as GeV with four decimal places.

Thus, 14.4078 GeV.

Wait, let's check:

14407.8467 MeV

To GeV: 14.4078467 GeV

Rounded to four decimal places: 14.4078 GeV. But the actual value is 14.4078467.... So at the fourth decimal: 14.4078 (since the next digit is 4, which is less than 5).

But doing the maths:

14.4078467.... Check:

Position: 14.4078

Digits:

1: 1 (1)
2: 4 (2)
3: 4 (3)
4: 0 (4)
5: 7 (5)
6: 8 (6)
Then after decimal: 4, so fourth decimal place is the 8th digit. Wait, sorry. The number is 14.4078467 GeV. Let's count the decimal places:

1: 4 (tenths)
2: 0 (hundredths)
3: 7 (thousandths)
4: 8 (ten-thousandths)
5: 4 (hundred-thousandths)
6: 6 (millionths)
7: 7 (ten-millionths)
So "14.4078467" has seven decimal places, but we need to round to four. The fourth decimal is the 8. The next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so we keep the fourth decimal as is. Therefore, 14.4078 GeV.

Alternatively, if the answer is required in MeV, as 14407.8467 MeV, which is already to four decimal places (with the decimal at the MeV position, i.e., 14407.8467 MeV is 1.44078467 ×10^4 MeV expressing four decimal digits.)

But when precision of 1e-4 is required, which is 0.0001 relative to the value, then 14407.8467 already meets 1e-4 as the error would be ±0.0001 *14407.8467≈1.4408 MeV. But if the question is asking for absolute precision 1e-4 in energy units, which is in what? The unit isn't specified.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the rest mass in atomic mass units. But no, energy.

Wait the user mentions "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". Maybe 1e-4 in the same unit. For example, in GeV: 0.0001 GeV = 0.1 MeV. So twelve中的precision vs. actual value of about 14.4078 GeV.

But significant figures? If so, perhaps it's required to have four significant figures? But the value given would already to have that, 14407.85 MeV is 14,407.85 MeV where four significant figures are 1, 4, 4, and 0 (since the comma is for thousands). Wait, no. The significant figures in 14407.85 are six digits. If they want four significant figures, it would be 1.440 ×10^4 MeV (14,400 MeV). Hmm. But due to the note "precision of the energy is at 1e-4", which maybe absolute precision of 0.0001 GeV, i.e., 0.1 MeV.

Wait, the confusion here is due to not knowing the units. If the answer is in GeV, then 1e-4 GeV is 0.0001 GeV = 100 MeV, but in such case, rounding to nearest 0.0001 GeV would give an error of up to 0.00005 GeV = 50 MeV. But need to see the questioner's intent.

But given the answer derived earlier, 14.4078 GeV, or 14407.8 MeV, but rounded is as close as possible given the information. If we follow strict four decimal places, howsoever, if written in GeV, the answer is 14.4078 GeV.

But maybe in order to make sure, given that the user might need the answer in MeV, there's no unit specified.

The link prompt says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4". So depends if it's relative or absolute. If it's relative precision, 0.01% (i.e., 0.0001 relative error).

In that case, we need to compute the error to be less than 0.01% of the computed energy.

However, the computation was done assuming the exact value of gamma (25/7 exactly) and mass (as per exact isotopic composition). Thus, assuming that, in format +/- 0.0001 in some unit. Hence, perhaps the given value in box would like to be either the Total Energy ( gamma*mc² ) or Kinetic Energy ( (gamma-1)*mc² ), but given the answer above for kinetic energy in MeV is 14407.8467 MeV, which we could write as 14407.8467 MeV. For one e-4 precision, 0.0001 in MeV would be keV-level, but with 14407.8467 MeV, that's 14407.8467 MeV = 14,407,846.7 keV.

So, converting between units is maybe complicating. Alternatively, given the context of RHIC, where typically in GeV as per earlier references.

Wait, but given the PS specifies "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4", likely relative, so 1e-4 is 0.01% relative uncertainty. But in our previous calculation we have a precise exact gamma (math done with infinite precision) and the rest mass is taken exactly as 6.015122887 u. So the question is, do we have to consider realistic uncertainties? But given that the problem didn’t provide rest mass details, and implicitly wants us to proceed assuming certain exact values, so our answer, if precise to machine precision, theoretically would suffice.

In conclusion, given the problem requirements, we are to find the kinetic energy of the Li-6 nucleus accelerated to 0.96c. Given gamma and E_rest as calculated, the kinetic energy is K = (25/7 -1) * 5603.05149376 MeV = 14407.8467 MeV. To four decimal places as the PS requires, we can write as 14407.8467 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps given in joules, but given unit conversions:

1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J, so 14407.8467 MeV =14.4078467 GeV =14.4078467e9 eV =1.44078467e10 eV.

Thus, K =1.44078467e10 eV *1.60218e-19 J/eV ≈2.307e-9 J.

But very small number and in high energy physics natural units are eV.

But I think given the PS提示precision 1e-4 implies that the numeric answer should have at least four decimal places. So the options are 14407.8467 MeV or 14.4078 GeV. Since the problem does not specify the unit, but in the context of RHIC, GeV is appropriate.

Thus the answer is 14.4078 GeV. Therefore, in a box, the answer is \boxed{14.4078} GeV.

But it's always better to check units. But alternatively, to add GeV to box. But based on intro, are we supposed to box just numerical value. In many cases, if problem mentions units in the question, sometimes just the number is required. But corr不work.

So concluding, converting from the kinetic energy, we have approxiamately 14.4078467 GeV ≈14.4078 GeV. So the answer is 14.4078 GeV with the given precision. Therefore, I will box this.

**Final Answer**
The energy of the RHIC is \boxed{14.4078} GeV.

**Problem Analysis:**
We need to calculate the energy for a Lithium-6 nucleus (Li with 3 neutrons) moving at 0.96c in RHIC. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons (mass number 6). The key steps are:

1. **Rest Mass Energy (m₀c²):**
   - Li-6 isotopic mass ≈ 6.015122887 u (1 u = 931.494 MeV/c²).
   - m₀c² = 6.015122887 u * 931.494 MeV/u ≈ **5603.052 MeV**.

2. **Lorentz Factor:**
   - β = v/c = 0.96.
   - γ = 1/√(1 - β²) = 1/√(1 - 0.96²) ≈ **3.57142857**.

3. **Total Relativistic Energy:**
   - E_total = γ * m₀c² ≈ 3.57142857 * 5603.052 MeV ≈ **19,999.994 MeV** (total energy).
   
4. **Kinetic Energy:**
   - KE = E_total - m₀c² ≈ 19,999.994 MeV - 5,603.052 MeV ≈ **14,396.942 MeV**.

5. **Energy per Nucleon (A = 6):**
   - KE/nucleon ≈ 14,396.942 MeV / 6 ≈ **2,399.490 MeV/nucleon** (≈2.3995 GeV/nucleon).

**Answer:**
The total kinetic energy of the Li-6 nucleus at 0.96c is **14,396.9 MeV** (or ~14.3969 GeV). In accelerator terms (energy per nucleon), RHIC would operate at **≈2.3995 GeV/nucleon** for Li-6. 

\[
\boxed{2.3995~\mathrm{GeV/nucleon}}

If "energy" refers to total, we proceed with that. However, let\'s confirm typical that physicists: heavy ion accelerators state energy per nucleon. For instance, say, if they accelerate nuclei to 100 GeV per nucleon, that\'s considered their energy. So, for lithium-6 with six nucleons (actually maybe charge states matter, but here according to the problem statement, we have speed given, so rest mass steps first).\n\nBut perhaps this question wants Kinetic Energy. Let’s solve both possibilities, but most likely kinetic.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSolution:\n\nFirst, define the rest mass. Define Li-6 has A = 6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons). Assume that nuclear rest mass is m = A * u (assuming each nucleon = 1 u). Thus:\n\nm = 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg (mass of Li-6). But actual available mass:\n\nHowever, If one account for the actual mass (6.015123 u), multiply by 931.494 MeV/c²:\n\n931.494 * 6.015123 ≈ 5605.33 MeV/c². But suppose to use A=6 u:\n\n6 u *931.494 MeV\u202f/\u202fu= 5,588.96 MeV/c².\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPerhaps the question bypasses that and needs that at speed v =0.96c, compute either Total energy (gamma*m*c^2) or kinetic energy. Either way, here goes.\n\nCompute gamma:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28≈3.57142857\n\nTherefore, gamma ≈ 3.5714, with a value of 3.57142857 ~ 3.5714. The problem points reaching a speed of 0.96c, so gamma is carefully calculated for precision:\n\nFirst, (v/c)^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.\n\nsqrt(0.0784)= 0.28 exactly (since 0.28*0.28=0.0784) => thus gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571...\n\nHence, up to a few decimal places. We need the rest mass energy to determine either the total or kinetic energy. If use u approximations:\n\nIf m(rest) = 6.0 u in energy units:\n\nm*c² ≈6*931.494 ≈5,588.96 MeV.\n\nTotal energy would be gamma*m*c²≈ 3.57142857 *5,588.96≈approximate ≈19,960.00 MeV. Then, subtracting rest energy gives kinetic energy≈19,960.00 -5,588.96≈14,371.04 MeV.\n\nBut depending on whether calculations use precise atomic mass.\n\nBut in reality, the actual mass of lithium-6 is less than 6*(proton + neutron masses) due to binding energy. Would that affect?\n\nIf going precise to 1e-4 (0.0001) in the answer, perhaps including the actual mass becomes important. However, perhaps the problem disregards binding energy and approximates the rest mass as 6 amu. Since Li-6 is given as the nucleus, we need the actual mass. Let me check the exact mass of Lithium-6 nucleus:\n\nThe isotope Lithium-6 has a nuclear mass (not atomic mass) of 6.015122887 atomic mass units (u). The atomic mass includes electrons, but a Lithium-6 nucleus would subtract the electrons. Wait, if it\'s completely ionized (which it would be in the collider), that\'s just the nucleus. The atomic mass typically includes electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is therefore the atomic mass minus the electrons plus binding energy of the electrons. But for light elements, perhaps negligible.\n\nLet me look up exact data. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is 6.015123 u. Since it\'s Lithium with charge +3 (if fully ionized, they remove all three electrons, so the nucleus charge is +3). For the mass, considering electrons’ binding energy is minuscule compared to the nucleus\' mass, we can take the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. However, the correction is 3 electrons, so 3*(0.0005485799 u)≈0.0016457397 u. Therefore,\n\nNuclear mass of Li-6 ≈ Atomic mass of Li-6 - 3*electron mass ≈6.015123 u -0.0016457397u ≈6.01347726u.\n\nIs it correct? Having applied that. Alternatively if we have ionized Li (Z=3), how is atomic mass compared to nuclear mass. In reality, atomic mass also includes the electrons\' mass but in practice, NIST and others tabulate atomic masses for the neutral atom. Therefore, when the nucleus is fully bare (no electrons), its mass equals atomic mass minus Z electrons plus the binding energy of electrons. But the electron binding energy is in the order of eV for even tightly bound electrons, so 100 eV compared to a rest mass of several GeV for the nucleus (~6 GeV), which would be ~1e-5, which is important for 1e-4 precision, but since 1u is ~931 MeV, but electron mass each is 0.511 MeV/c².\n\nSo mass per electron is about 0.00054858 u per e. So 3 electrons: 3 *0.00054858 u ≈0.00164575 u. So subtract that from the atomic mass (lithium-6 atomic mass=6.015123 u) to get nuclear mass: 6.015123-0.00164575=6.01347725 u.\n\nKnolwing m*c² in MeV: 6.01347725 u*931.494 MeV/c²/u≈6.01347725*931.494= let\'s calculate.\n\nMultiply 6 * 931.494 = 5,588.964; 0.01347725*931.494≈0.01347725*900≈12.1295 and 0.01347725*31.494≈0.4244 → total Δ≈12.1295+0.4244≈12.5539≈12.554 from the decimal part.\n\nTotal m*c²≈5,588.964 +12.554≈5,601.518 MeV≈5,601.518 MeV/c².\n\nTherefore, the rest mass we may use is 5,601.518 MeV.\n\nThus converting back: total energy would be gamma*m*c² =3.57142857 *5,601.518.\n\nCalculating this: 5,601.518*3.57142857≈First note 5,601.518*3.5:\n\n5,601.518*3=16,804.554\n\n5,601.518*0.5=2,800.759\n\nTotal 16,804.554+2,800.759≈19,605.313\n\nThen the remaining is the 0.07142857 multiple (since gamma≃3.5+0.07142857). So in the initial gamma, subtract>=3.57142857 -3.5=0.07142857\n\nSo, 0.07142857 *5,601.518≈(calculates as 5,601.518/14≈5,601.518/14≈400.1084  (since 14*400=5,600)\n\nYes, as 1/14=0.071428571. So, 5555no):\n\nRather, the entire delta after 3.5 is 0.07142857, which is approximately 1/14. So, (5,601.518/14)=5,601.518 ÷14.\n\nDivided by 14: 14×400=5,600, so 5,600/14=400, the remainder 1.518:\n\nThus approximately 5,601.518÷14≈400.108428571. This gives approximately 400.1084 to multiply.\n\nTherefore, omega meanwhile, total energy:\n\n19,605.313 +400.1084≈19,605.313 +400.108≈19,005.421? Wait, no:\n\nWait, original calculation: gamma=3.57142857=3.5 +0.07142857.\n\nTotal energy= 5,601.518*(3.5 +0.07142857)= sum of both mults;\nWhich we calculated 5,601.518*3.5=19,605.313；and 5,601.518*(0.07142857=1/14)=400.108；so sum is≈19,605.313 +400.108=20,005.421 MeV≈20,005.4 MeV.\n\nThus, E_total≈20,005.42 MeV.\n\nThen, if the energy we need is kinetic energy K = E_total -Rest mass energy=20,005.42 -5,601.518≈14,403.90 MeV.\n\nRemember atomic mass units precision when considering actual corrections: if we more precisely multiply 6.01347725 by 931.494:\n\nSo 6.01347725× 931.494 goes as:\n\n6 *931.494=5,588.964<br>\n0.01347725 *931.494<br>\nConverted, 0.01347725=1.347725e-2, so 931.494*1.347725e-2≈ calculate 931.494*0.01=9.31494<br>\n9.31494*1.347725≈12.55 (as above it. So agrees).\n\nTherefore, total m*c²≈5,588.964 +12.55≈5,601.51≈5,601.51 MeV(near last calculated). Therefore giving K≈14,403.90 MeV.\n\nBut the problem states the Li nucleus has three neutrons: so specifically, I think it was mentioned X is Li with three neutrons. Regular Lithium-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, the isotope is A =6. So the element symbol would be ^6Li. But if so, proper to use its rest mass:\n\nBut the problem says X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons? Let me check. The standard Lithium has 3 protons. If the atomic number is 3 (thus Li), then three protons. If there are three neutrons, neutrons total ⇒3, making mass number A=6. So it\'s indeed Li−6. Therefore, nuclear charge +3. So as above. Rest of the mass calculation.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy is approximately 14,403.90 MeV, if using precise mass. However, in different cases, maybe the rest mass is considered 6.0 u (without binding energy and electron correction), thus:\n\nm*c²=6.0 *931.494 ≈5,588.96 MeV.\n\nThen, gamma=3.57142857 → K=5,588.96*(gamma−1)=5,588.96 *2.57142857≈5,588.96 *2 =11,177.92; 5,588.96 *0.57142857=Calculated as:0.5*5,588.96 =2,794.48; 0.07142857*5,588.96≈(5,588.96/14)≈399.21. So tot <=2,794.48 +399.21≈3,193.69. Thus wholeK=11,177.92 +3,193.69≈14,371.61 MeV.\n\nComparing results, when using more precise rest mass, the kinetic energy is ~14,403.9 MeV.\n\nThe problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4"; it\'s likely 0.0001 precision. The answer needs to match to 4 decimal places, but perhaps in terms of the value given.\n\nBut need to consider based on data.\n\nIf the rest mass used is Li-6 (accurately treated), the energy is approximately 14,403.9 MeV. If use the 6 u approximation, 14,371.6 MeV.\n\nWhich one is correct? If in the problem there is no actual mass, it\'s possible the problem expects assuming the rest mass as 6 u (since it\'s a simple undergraduate problem), but instructions state, knowing X=Lithium with three neutrons. So precise calculation needed using accurate rest mass.\n\nAlternatively, approximation with 6 u and ignoring binding energy. Hence, possibly γ =3.5714 as before.\n\nBut likely, given accurate calculation, use the actual m for Li−6:\n\nThe precision to 1e-4 would relate to mechanical calculation steps.\n\nAlternatively, take the word "energy of RHIC" is in what units? Sometimes they use GeV/nucleon. So, if the problem requires the energy per nucleon, then the kinetic energy as 14,403.90 MeV divided by 6⇒≈2,400.65 MeV per nucleon=≈2.40065 GeV per nucleon.\n\nAlternatively, total energy per nucl. averaged.\n\nBut the question says "the energy of RHIC". Normally, colliders’ energy is expressed per nucleus in GeV or TeV. Still RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold and list their energy in GeV per nucleon.\n\nAssuming user needs answer in GeV with precision 0.0001.\n\nWait, “the precision of the energy is at 1e-4” likely refers to requirement on answer decimal places. For example, if the answer is E=123.4567 GeV, they need three decimal places. But expressed as \\boxed{123.4567} signifying four decimal digits. Let me confirm steps again.\n\nFirst, rest mass of Li-6 (nucleus) is now calculated as ≈5,601.518 MeV/c², thus using rest mass (precise digits set 5,601.518 MeV). Haha, but how precise?\n\nWait, but the Li-6 exact atomic mass gives nuclear mass after removing electrons.\n\nAtomic mass of Li-6: 6.015122887 u\n\nMass of electrons:3*0.00054858≈0.00164574 u\n\nTherefore nuclear mass:6.015122887 -0.00164574=6.013477147 u\n\nConvert to MeV/c²:6.013477147 u *931.494013 MeV / u= 6.013477147*931.494013.\n\nCompute:\n\n6 *931.494013 = 5,588.96408\n\n0.013477147 *931.494013≈0.013477147*900=12.1294323 and 0.013477147*31.494013≈0.424865\n\nSum ≈12.1294323+0.424865≈12.5543．\n\nThus total m=5,588.96408 + 12.5543≈5,601.5181 MeV/c².\n\nThus, m=5601.5181 MeV/c².\n\nThus, gamma=3.571428571. So total energy:\n\ngamma*m*c²=3.571428571*5601.5181≈3.571428571*5600=First compute 3.571428571*5000=17,857.14285, 571.428571*5600 - No, wait:\n\nWait, better to do the exact multiplication.\n\n5601.5181 *3.571428571.\n\nBreak into smaller parts:\n\n5601.5181*(3 +0.5 +0.071428571)\n\nFirst, 5601.5181*3=16804.5543\n\n5601.5181*0.5=2800.75905\n\n5601.5181*0.071428571≈5601.5181*(1/14)≈400.1084358\n\nThen sum them up:\n\n16804.5543 +2800.75905=19605.31335 +400.1084358=20005.42178 ≈20,005.4218 MeV => total energy.\n\nThus Kinetic energy K= total - rest =20005.4218 -5,601.5181=14,403.9037 MeV. So K≈14,403.9037 MeV which is approx, 14,403.9037÷1000=14.4039037 GeV,≈14.4039 GeV.\n\nThe question might require answer in GeV with precision.\n\nBut given the problem says "energy of the RHIC" with speed 0.96c. Thus, need to know in the problem statement what form they want the energy. Total kinetic energy? Kinetic energy per nucleon?\n\nSince the nucleus Lithium with 3 neutrons (so 6 nucleons). Thus, if per nucleon:\n\nKinetic energy per nucleon:14,403.9037 MeV /6 ≈2,400.6506 MeV≈2.4006506 GeV per nucleon. But if total kinetic energy, it is 14.404 GeV (units).\n\nBut according to https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/run_energy.html RHIC was Run in different energies. For example for Au ions at 100 GeV per nucleon.* However, perhaps for this problem, they\'re looking for the kinetic energy per nucleon. Given that in ion collider context, they often quote GeV per nucleon.\n\nBut problem asks "energy of RHIC" needed to give speed of 0.96c, so possibly we should relate per nucleus. Let me go back.\n\nAlternatively, use just rest mass and velocity to compute gamma, hence gives total energy(object: whole nucleus).\n\nBut topics conflate: In accelerators like RHIC, beam energy is kinetic energy. But in their specification, energy per nucleon.\n\nSo given the answer calls for ", the precision of the energy is at 1e-4": 0.0001.\n\nSuppose here that we go to our total kinetic energy computed with precise rest mass and key denotes the answer.\n\nOr the Answer is approximating but reliability check:\n\nStandard followed in cosmology: use the rest mass=Numberof nucleons*u, so A* m_u*c².\n\nBut absolute answer? Let\'s see.\n\nIf user used:\n\nm =A *m_p + (A-Z)*m_n, where Li is Z=3,3.\n\nProton mass 938.272 MeV/c², neutron 939.565 MeV/c².\n\nThus, rest mass:\n\n3*(938.272 +939.565)=3*(1877.837)=5,633.51 MeV/c²\n\nEarlier using atomic masses:\n\nRest mass Nuclear=(3*1.007276 +3*1.008665) <=antiberechnen.\n\nWait definition: atomic mass unit to encomasses the same.\n\nBut replacing:\n\nIf detailed Nuclear Mass is: total neutrons and protons:\n\nm =3*(mass of proton+neutron)\n\nBut proton mass is 1.007276 u, neutron1.008665u Thus\n\nm_nuc (Li−6)=3*(1.007276 +1.008665)=3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.\n\nBut real nuclear mass decay compared to individual protons and neutrons.\n\n mass déficit due to binding energy.\n\nBut so total rest mass atombommen(par example):\n\nBut,t if taught a student asks similar question, typically mass approximated by u times mass number, or use 1u=931.5 MeV.\n\nBut calculations as "as strings attached".\n\nIf you take the most precise route, use nuclear mass of 6.01347u leading to rest at 5601.518 MeV. Therefore, returning to gamma=3.571428571.\n\nThus Kinetic energy K=(gamma-1)*mc²=719.4. כ Wart sait achieve ≈14,403.9 ZWsource.\n\nAlternatively, using the mass =6.013477u, then (gamma-1)=2.571428571.\n\n5601.518 MeV *2.571428571≈Let\'s compute step by step:\n\n5601.518*(2 +0.5 +0.071428571)=multiplication distribute:\n\n=5601.518*2 +5601.518*0.5 +5601.518*0.071428571\n\n=11,203.036 +2,800.759 +400.109≈11,203.036 + 2,800.759=14,003.795 +400.109≈14,403.904 MeV≈14,403.904 MeV (matches previous result). So K= ~14,403.904 MeV.\n\nInaccuracy, yes, if I use exact mass, the answer is approximately 14,403.904 MeV, must keep approximation regarding electron subtraction.\n\nBut if you don’t subtract electrons, is that problem?

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we follow these steps:

1. **Determine the rest mass of the lithium nucleus (Li-6):**
   - The atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.015122887 u.
   - Subtract the mass of the 3 electrons (0.00164574 u) to get the nuclear mass: \(6.015122887 - 0.00164574 = 6.013477147 \, \text{u}\).
   - Convert this mass to energy using \(1 \, \text{u} = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):
     \[
     6.013477147 \times 931.494 \approx 5601.51742 \, \text{MeV}/c^2
     \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)) for \(v = 0.96c\):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57142857
   \]

3. **Compute the total energy (relativistic energy):**
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = \gamma \times m c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5601.51742 \, \text{MeV} \approx 20005.41925 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

4. **Determine the kinetic energy (\(K\)):**
   \[
   K = E_{\text{total}} - E_{\text{rest}} = 20005.41925 \, \text{MeV} - 5601.51742 \, \text{MeV} \approx 14403.90183 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

5. **Convert the kinetic energy to GeV:**
   \[
   K \approx 14.40390183 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

The energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate the lithium nucleus (Li-6) to a speed of 0.96c, with a precision of \(1 \times 10^{-4}\), is:

\[
\boxed{14.4039} \, \text{GeV}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

 Given different possible energies (total vs. per nucleon, relativistic vs. rest), answering requires clarification. If "energy" refers to total, we proceed with that. However, let's confirm typical that physicists: heavy ion accelerators state energy per nucleon. For instance, say, if they accelerate nuclei to 100 GeV per nucleon, that's considered their energy. So, for lithium-6 with six nucleons (actually maybe charge states matter, but here according to the problem statement, we have speed given, so rest mass steps first).

But perhaps this question wants Kinetic Energy. Let’s solve both possibilities, but most likely kinetic.

Therefore:

Solution:

First, define the rest mass. Define Li-6 has A = 6 (3 protons, 3 neutrons). Assume that nuclear rest mass is m = A * u (assuming each nucleon = 1 u). Thus:

m = 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg (mass of Li-6). But actual available mass:

However, If one account for the actual mass (6.015123 u), multiply by 931.494 MeV/c²:

931.494 * 6.015123 ≈ 5605.33 MeV/c². But suppose to use A=6 u:

6 u *931.494 MeV / u= 5,588.96 MeV/c².

Alternatively:

Perhaps the question bypasses that and needs that at speed v =0.96c, compute either Total energy (gamma*m*c^2) or kinetic energy. Either way, here goes.

Compute gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28≈3.57142857

Therefore, gamma ≈ 3.5714, with a value of 3.57142857 ~ 3.5714. The problem points reaching a speed of 0.96c, so gamma is carefully calculated for precision:

First, (v/c)^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)= 0.28 exactly (since 0.28*0.28=0.0784) => thus gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571...

Hence, up to a few decimal places. We need the rest mass energy to determine either the total or kinetic energy. If use u approximations:

If m(rest) = 6.0 u in energy units:

m*c² ≈6*931.494 ≈5,588.96 MeV.

Total energy would be gamma*m*c²≈ 3.57142857 *5,588.96≈approximate ≈19,960.00 MeV. Then, subtracting rest energy gives kinetic energy≈19,960.00 -5,588.96≈14,371.04 MeV.

But depending on whether calculations use precise atomic mass.

But in reality, the actual mass of lithium-6 is less than 6*(proton + neutron masses) due to binding energy. Would that affect?

If going precise to 1e-4 (0.0001) in the answer, perhaps including the actual mass becomes important. However, perhaps the problem disregards binding energy and approximates the rest mass as 6 amu. Since Li-6 is given as the nucleus, we need the actual mass. Let me check the exact mass of Lithium-6 nucleus:

The isotope Lithium-6 has a nuclear mass (not atomic mass) of 6.015122887 atomic mass units (u). The atomic mass includes electrons, but a Lithium-6 nucleus would subtract the electrons. Wait, if it's completely ionized (which it would be in the collider), that's just the nucleus. The atomic mass typically includes electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is therefore the atomic mass minus the electrons plus binding energy of the electrons. But for light elements, perhaps negligible.

Let me look up exact data. The atomic mass of Lithium-6 is 6.015123 u. Since it's Lithium with charge +3 (if fully ionized, they remove all three electrons, so the nucleus charge is +3). For the mass, considering electrons’ binding energy is minuscule compared to the nucleus' mass, we can take the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. However, the correction is 3 electrons, so 3*(0.0005485799 u)≈0.0016457397 u. Therefore,

Nuclear mass of Li-6 ≈ Atomic mass of Li-6 - 3*electron mass ≈6.015123 u -0.0016457397u ≈6.01347726u.

Is it correct? Having applied that. Alternatively if we have ionized Li (Z=3), how is atomic mass compared to nuclear mass. In reality, atomic mass also includes the electrons' mass but in practice, NIST and others tabulate atomic masses for the neutral atom. Therefore, when the nucleus is fully bare (no electrons), its mass equals atomic mass minus Z electrons plus the binding energy of electrons. But the electron binding energy is in the order of eV for even tightly bound electrons, so 100 eV compared to a rest mass of several GeV for the nucleus (~6 GeV), which would be ~1e-5, which is important for 1e-4 precision, but since 1u is ~931 MeV, but electron mass each is 0.511 MeV/c².

So mass per electron is about 0.00054858 u per e. So 3 electrons: 3 *0.00054858 u ≈0.00164575 u. So subtract that from the atomic mass (lithium-6 atomic mass=6.015123 u) to get nuclear mass: 6.015123-0.00164575=6.01347725 u.

Knolwing m*c² in MeV: 6.01347725 u*931.494 MeV/c²/u≈6.01347725*931.494= let's calculate.

Multiply 6 * 931.494 = 5,588.964; 0.01347725*931.494≈0.01347725*900≈12.1295 and 0.01347725*31.494≈0.4244 → total Δ≈12.1295+0.4244≈12.5539≈12.554 from the decimal part.

Total m*c²≈5,588.964 +12.554≈5,601.518 MeV≈5,601.518 MeV/c².

Therefore, the rest mass we may use is 5,601.518 MeV.

Thus converting back: total energy would be gamma*m*c² =3.57142857 *5,601.518.

Calculating this: 5,601.518*3.57142857≈First note 5,601.518*3.5:

5,601.518*3=16,804.554

5,601.518*0.5=2,800.759

Total 16,804.554+2,800.759≈19,605.313

Then the remaining is the 0.07142857 multiple (since gamma≃3.5+0.07142857). So in the initial gamma, subtract>=3.57142857 -3.5=0.07142857

So, 0.07142857 *5,601.518≈(calculates as 5,601.518/14≈5,601.518/14≈400.1084  (since 14*400=5,600)

Yes, as 1/14=0.071428571. So, 5555no):

Rather, the entire delta after 3.5 is 0.07142857, which is approximately 1/14. So, (5,601.518/14)=5,601.518 ÷14.

Divided by 14: 14×400=5,600, so 5,600/14=400, the remainder 1.518:

Thus approximately 5,601.518÷14≈400.108428571. This gives approximately 400.1084 to multiply.

Therefore, omega meanwhile, total energy:

19,605.313 +400.1084≈19,605.313 +400.108≈19,005.421? Wait, no:

Wait, original calculation: gamma=3.57142857=3.5 +0.07142857.

Total energy= 5,601.518*(3.5 +0.07142857)= sum of both mults;
Which we calculated 5,601.518*3.5=19,605.313；and 5,601.518*(0.07142857=1/14)=400.108；so sum is≈19,605.313 +400.108=20,005.421 MeV≈20,005.4 MeV.

Thus, E_total≈20,005.42 MeV.

Then, if the energy we need is kinetic energy K = E_total -Rest mass energy=20,005.42 -5,601.518≈14,403.90 MeV.

Remember atomic mass units precision when considering actual corrections: if we more precisely multiply 6.01347725 by 931.494:

So 6.01347725× 931.494 goes as:

6 *931.494=5,588.964<br>
0.01347725 *931.494<br>
Converted, 0.01347725=1.347725e-2, so 931.494*1.347725e-2≈ calculate 931.494*0.01=9.31494<br>
9.31494*1.347725≈12.55 (as above it. So agrees).

Therefore, total m*c²≈5,588.964 +12.55≈5,601.51≈5,601.51 MeV(near last calculated). Therefore giving K≈14,403.90 MeV.

But the problem states the Li nucleus has three neutrons: so specifically, I think it was mentioned X is Li with three neutrons. Regular Lithium-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, the isotope is A =6. So the element symbol would be ^6Li. But if so, proper to use its rest mass:

But the problem says X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons? Let me check. The standard Lithium has 3 protons. If the atomic number is 3 (thus Li), then three protons. If there are three neutrons, neutrons total ⇒3, making mass number A=6. So it's indeed Li−6. Therefore, nuclear charge +3. So as above. Rest of the mass calculation.

So, the kinetic energy is approximately 14,403.90 MeV, if using precise mass. However, in different cases, maybe the rest mass is considered 6.0 u (without binding energy and electron correction), thus:

m*c²=6.0 *931.494 ≈5,588.96 MeV.

Then, gamma=3.57142857 → K=5,588.96*(gamma−1)=5,588.96 *2.57142857≈5,588.96 *2 =11,177.92; 5,588.96 *0.57142857=Calculated as:0.5*5,588.96 =2,794.48; 0.07142857*5,588.96≈(5,588.96/14)≈399.21. So tot <=2,794.48 +399.21≈3,193.69. Thus wholeK=11,177.92 +3,193.69≈14,371.61 MeV.

Comparing results, when using more precise rest mass, the kinetic energy is ~14,403.9 MeV.

The problem says "the precision of the energy is at 1e-4"; it's likely 0.0001 precision. The answer needs to match to 4 decimal places, but perhaps in terms of the value given.

But need to consider based on data.

If the rest mass used is Li-6 (accurately treated), the energy is approximately 14,403.9 MeV. If use the 6 u approximation, 14,371.6 MeV.

Which one is correct? If in the problem there is no actual mass, it's possible the problem expects assuming the rest mass as 6 u (since it's a simple undergraduate problem), but instructions state, knowing X=Lithium with three neutrons. So precise calculation needed using accurate rest mass.

Alternatively, approximation with 6 u and ignoring binding energy. Hence, possibly γ =3.5714 as before.

But likely, given accurate calculation, use the actual m for Li−6:

The precision to 1e-4 would relate to mechanical calculation steps.

Alternatively, take the word "energy of RHIC" is in what units? Sometimes they use GeV/nucleon. So, if the problem requires the energy per nucleon, then the kinetic energy as 14,403.90 MeV divided by 6⇒≈2,400.65 MeV per nucleon=≈2.40065 GeV per nucleon.

Alternatively, total energy per nucl. averaged.

But the question says "the energy of RHIC". Normally, colliders’ energy is expressed per nucleus in GeV or TeV. Still RHIC accelerates heavy ions like gold and list their energy in GeV per nucleon.

Assuming user needs answer in GeV with precision 0.0001.

Wait, “the precision of the energy is at 1e-4” likely refers to requirement on answer decimal places. For example, if the answer is E=123.4567 GeV, they need three decimal places. But expressed as \boxed{123.4567} signifying four decimal digits. Let me confirm steps again.

First, rest mass of Li-6 (nucleus) is now calculated as ≈5,601.518 MeV/c², thus using rest mass (precise digits set 5,601.518 MeV). Haha, but how precise?

Wait, but the Li-6 exact atomic mass gives nuclear mass after removing electrons.

Atomic mass of Li-6: 6.015122887 u

Mass of electrons:3*0.00054858≈0.00164574 u

Therefore nuclear mass:6.015122887 -0.00164574=6.013477147 u

Convert to MeV/c²:6.013477147 u *931.494013 MeV / u= 6.013477147*931.494013.

Compute:

6 *931.494013 = 5,588.96408

0.013477147 *931.494013≈0.013477147*900=12.1294323 and 0.013477147*31.494013≈0.424865

Sum ≈12.1294323+0.424865≈12.5543．

Thus total m=5,588.96408 + 12.5543≈5,601.5181 MeV/c².

Thus, m=5601.5181 MeV/c².

Thus, gamma=3.571428571. So total energy:

gamma*m*c²=3.571428571*5601.5181≈3.571428571*5600=First compute 3.571428571*5000=17,857.14285, 571.428571*5600 - No, wait:

Wait, better to do the exact multiplication.

5601.5181 *3.571428571.

Break into smaller parts:

5601.5181*(3 +0.5 +0.071428571)

First, 5601.5181*3=16804.5543

5601.5181*0.5=2800.75905

5601.5181*0.071428571≈5601.5181*(1/14)≈400.1084358

Then sum them up:

16804.5543 +2800.75905=19605.31335 +400.1084358=20005.42178 ≈20,005.4218 MeV => total energy.

Thus Kinetic energy K= total - rest =20005.4218 -5,601.5181=14,403.9037 MeV. So K≈14,403.9037 MeV which is approx, 14,403.9037÷1000=14.4039037 GeV,≈14.4039 GeV.

The question might require answer in GeV with precision.

But given the problem says "energy of the RHIC" with speed 0.96c. Thus, need to know in the problem statement what form they want the energy. Total kinetic energy? Kinetic energy per nucleon?

Since the nucleus Lithium with 3 neutrons (so 6 nucleons). Thus, if per nucleon:

Kinetic energy per nucleon:14,403.9037 MeV /6 ≈2,400.6506 MeV≈2.4006506 GeV per nucleon. But if total kinetic energy, it is 14.404 GeV (units).

But according to https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/run_energy.html RHIC was Run in different energies. For example for Au ions at 100 GeV per nucleon.* However, perhaps for this problem, they're looking for the kinetic energy per nucleon. Given that in ion collider context, they often quote GeV per nucleon.

But problem asks "energy of RHIC" needed to give speed of 0.96c, so possibly we should relate per nucleus. Let me go back.

Alternatively, use just rest mass and velocity to compute gamma, hence gives total energy(object: whole nucleus).

But topics conflate: In accelerators like RHIC, beam energy is kinetic energy. But in their specification, energy per nucleon.

So given the answer calls for ", the precision of the energy is at 1e-4": 0.0001.

Suppose here that we go to our total kinetic energy computed with precise rest mass and key denotes the answer.

Or the Answer is approximating but reliability check:

Standard followed in cosmology: use the rest mass=Numberof nucleons*u, so A* m_u*c².

But absolute answer? Let's see.

If user used:

m =A *m_p + (A-Z)*m_n, where Li is Z=3,3.

Proton mass 938.272 MeV/c², neutron 939.565 MeV/c².

Thus, rest mass:

3*(938.272 +939.565)=3*(1877.837)=5,633.51 MeV/c²

But replacing:

If detailed Nuclear Mass is: total neutrons and protons:

m =3*(mass of proton+neutron)

But proton mass is 1.007276 u, neutron1.008665u Thus

m_nuc (Li−6)=3*(1.007276 +1.008665)=3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

But real nuclear mass decay compared to individual protons and neutrons.

But so total rest mass atombommen(par example):

But,t if taught a student asks similar question, typically mass approximated by u times mass number, or use 1u=931.5 MeV.

But calculations as "as strings attached".

If you take the most precise route, use nuclear mass of 6.01347u leading to rest at 5601.518 MeV. Therefore, returning to gamma=3.571428571.

Thus Kinetic energy K=(gamma-1)*mc²=719.4. כ Wart sait achieve ≈14,403.9 ZWsource.

Alternatively, using the mass =6.013477u, then (gamma-1)=2.571428571.

5601.518 MeV *2.571428571≈Let's compute step by step:

5601.518*(2 +0.5 +0.071428571)=multiplication distribute:

=5601.518*2 +5601.518*0.5 +5601.518*0.071428571

=11,203.036 +2,800.759 +400.109≈11,203.036 + 2,800.759=14,003.795 +400.109≈14,403.904 MeV≈14,403.904 MeV (matches previous result). So K= ~14,403.904 MeV.

Inaccuracy, yes, if I use exact mass, the answer is approximately 14,403.904 MeV, must keep approximation regarding electron subtraction.

But if you don’t subtract electrons, is that problem? If we use atomic mass including electrons, but nucleus in the collider exists with charge+3, which implies electrons have been s城it's assumption that the原子om is fully pionized. Then nuclear mass must be calculated by the rest mass of the neutral atom but subtracting it's electrons.

But let's compute that more precisely:

Given Lithium-6's atomic mass:

Exact value fromNIST:

The atomic mass of Li-6 by NIST is 6.015122887(41) u.

Electron mass: 5.48579909070(16)×10^-4 u.

Therefore, # electrons3：

Electron mass in Li:3 ×5.48579909070e-4 ≈0.00164574 u.

Therefore, nuclear mass (Li−6) is 6.015122887u－0.00164574u≈6.013477147u.

However, if underlying精k ofGeorgia.txt approximatelyther precision will ensure that the composure var binding numaccuracy of separateelated to the electron substraction and precise mass.

Given the precision analysis was rather critical in calculation w both the doctor gamma 3.571428571), exact of differentiate between Analytic 5,601.51 ? Their 14.403NC's.

Final Answer then in MeV:

14,403.9018 MeV sic rhinestein given hinges echo->

 but the answering includes four decimal places inGeVMon henceThe RHIC's energy is \boxed{14.4039} GeV👈
