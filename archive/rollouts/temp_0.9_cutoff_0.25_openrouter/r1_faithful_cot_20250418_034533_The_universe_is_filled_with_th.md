# Original Question

The universe is filled with the Cosmic Microwave Background. Consider the annihilation of high energy \gamma-rays with a photon from the CMB Radiation into electron-positron, i.e. $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$. From what energy \gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process? Knowing that the average photon energy of the CMB is $10^{-3}eV$.

The threshold energy for gamma-rays to annihilate with CMB photons via the process \(\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-\) is determined by the condition that the product of their energies must be at least equal to the square of the electron rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is \(0.511 \, \text{MeV}\), so the threshold condition is:

\[
E_{\gamma} \cdot E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (m_e c^2)^2
\]

Given the average energy of a CMB photon \(E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}\), we solve for the gamma-ray energy \(E_{\gamma}\):

\[
E_{\gamma} \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_{\text{CMB}}}
\]

Substituting \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}\):

\[
E_{\gamma} \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. Square the electron rest mass energy:
   \[
   (0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2 = 0.261121 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2
   \]

2. Divide by the CMB photon energy:
   \[
   \frac{0.261121 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
   \]

Converting to teraelectronvolts (TeV), where \(1 \, \text{TeV} = 10^{12} \, \text{eV}\):

\[
2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 261 \, \text{TeV}
\]

Thus, gamma-rays with energies above approximately \(2.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}\) (or 260 TeV) would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons. 

\[
\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy at which gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons producing electron-positron pairs. The average energy of the CMB photon is given as 10^-3 eV. Hmm... Let me start by recalling what I know about this process.

First, the process is gamma-gamma collision leading to electron-positron pair production. For this to happen, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is 0.511 MeV, so together that's 1.022 MeV. But since we're dealing with photons in different frames (one is a high-energy gamma-ray, and the other is a low-energy CMB photon), we need to consider the center-of-momentum frame where their combined energy meets this threshold.

Wait, maybe I should think about the photon-photon collision in a head-on collision. The condition for pair production is that the product of their energies in the center-of-mass frame satisfies (E1 * E2) >= (m_e c^2)^2, but wait, actually, I might need to consider the cross-section threshold. Let me recall the formula for the threshold energy.

The threshold condition for pair production (gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-) is given by the product of the energies of the two photons in the frame where the collision is head-on. So, if we have two photons with energies E1 and E2, and the angle between their momenta is θ, the threshold condition is:

E1 * E2 * (1 - cosθ) >= 2 (m_e c^2)^2

But for the case where the photons are moving directly towards each other (head-on collision), θ = 180 degrees, so cosθ = -1, so 1 - cosθ = 2. Therefore, the threshold simplifies to:

E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2

Wait, that seems simpler. So the product of their energies in the lab frame (if head-on) needs to be at least (m_e c^2)^2. But wait, is this the case?

Actually, I need to check if my understanding here is correct. Let me think. Let me recall that for two photons colliding head-on, the square of the center-of-mass energy s is given by:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1|c + |p2|c)^2

But since photons are massless, their energy is |p|c, so substituting p1 = E1/c and p2 = E2/c (but directions opposite), so the momentum vectors are opposite. Thus, the total momentum is (E1/c - E2/c) in magnitude. But depending on direction. Wait, actually when colliding head-on, their momenta are in opposite directions.

So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2, since p1 = E1/c and p2 = E2/c.

Calculating that: (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1² + 2E1E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2E1E2 + E2²] = 4E1E2

So s = 4E1E2

Then, for pair production to occur, the center-of-mass energy squared must be at least (2m_e c^2)^2, since the pair production requires creating two electrons (each m_e c^2). So, 4E1E2 >= (2m_e c^2)^2 => 4E1E2 >= 4(m_e c^2)^2 => E1E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2

Thus, yes, the product of the two photon energies must be at least equal to (m_e c^2)^2. So in the case of a head-on collision, the threshold condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Therefore, if we have one photon with energy E (the high-energy gamma-ray) and the other photon with energy ε (the CMB photon with ε ~ 10^-3 eV), then we need E * ε ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

We can solve for E: E ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / ε

Given that m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 10^6 eV, so plugging in:

E ≥ (0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 / (10^-3 eV)

Calculating that:

(0.511)^2 × (10^6)^2 / 10^-3 = 0.261121 × 10^12 eV / 10^-3 eV = 0.261121 × 10^15 eV = 2.61121 × 10^14 eV = ~2.61 × 10^14 eV

But that's in eV. Converting to more standard units, 1 TeV is 10^12 eV, so this would be about 261 TeV. Wait, that seems very high. But let me check again.

Wait, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So (0.511 MeV)^2 / (10^-3 eV). Let me compute each step carefully.

First, square 0.511 MeV:

0.511^2 = approx 0.261

So (0.261) (MeV)^2

But then we divide by 10^-3 eV. Let's convert MeV to eV. 1 MeV = 10^6 eV.

Then, (0.261 × (10^6 eV)^2) / (10^-3 eV) = 0.261 × 10^{12} eV² / 10^{-3} eV = 0.261 × 10^{15} eV = 2.61 × 10^{14} eV.

Yes, so that's 2.61 × 10^14 eV, which is 2.61 × 10^2 TeV (since 10^12 eV is 1 TeV). So 261 TeV. Wait, 10^14 is 100 TeV (since 1 TeV is 10^12, so 10^14 is 100 TeV). Wait, 10^14 eV = 10^2 × 10^12 eV = 100 TeV. So, 2.61 × 10^14 eV is 261 TeV.

But the question is asking for the energy at which gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process. So gamma-rays above this threshold would annihilate with CMB photons and produce electron-positron pairs, which would limit their propagation distance. So this is the threshold energy where the process becomes possible.

But wait, the calculation gives us 261 TeV. However, in reality, the threshold for interaction is actually a bit lower than this, because even if the collision isn't perfectly head-on, the angle comes into play.

But if we assume that the CMB photons are isotropic, then the most probable interaction angle would not necessarily be head-on. However, in the universe, high-energy gamma-rays are moving through the CMB, which is a sea of photons in all directions. So the actual calculation would involve averaging over angles. But the minimal photon energy required would come when the collision is head-on, which is the most favorable case. So the threshold energy calculated here corresponds to the head-on collision, which gives the minimal gamma-ray energy required for pair production with the CMB photon.

So high-energy gamma-rays above this threshold would have a high probability of interacting with the CMB photons and producing pairs, hence their mean free path would be limited, effectively limiting their lifetime in the universe. Therefore, the answer is approximately 261 TeV. But perhaps we need to express it in terms of exact value, using more precise numbers.

Let me do the exact calculation. The rest mass energy of the electron is exactly 0.5109989461 MeV, so let's use that.

So (0.5109989461 MeV)^2 / (0.001 eV)

First, convert 0.5109989461 MeV to eV: 0.5109989461 × 10^6 eV = 510998.9461 eV

So squared: (510998.9461 eV)^2 = ?

Let me compute that. Let me approximate 510998.9461 ≈ 511,000 eV.

So (5.11 × 10^5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 × 10^10 = 26.1121 × 10^10 eV²

Divide by 0.001 eV: 26.1121 × 10^10 / 0.001 = 26.1121 × 10^13 = 2.61121 × 10^14 eV

So again, 2.61 × 10^14 eV, or about 261 TeV. That seems consistent.

However, in the literature, I recall that the threshold for interaction with the CMB is around tens of TeV. Wait, is my calculation incorrect? Because I once saw that the threshold for pair production on CMB is about 10 TeV or something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Hmm. Wait, if the CMB photon has an energy of 10^-3 eV, and the threshold product is (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 = 0.261 x 10^12 eV^2. Then dividing by 10^-3 eV gives 0.261 x 10^15 eV, which is 2.61 x 10^14 eV, so 261 TeV.

But in reality, the CMB photons have a blackbody spectrum with a peak at around 1 mm wavelength, which corresponds to about 10^-3 eV (since E = hc/λ, and for λ=1mm=1e-3 m, hc=1240 eV nm, so E=1240 eV nm / 1e6 nm = 1.24e-3 eV). But there is a distribution of photon energies. The average photon energy is given here as 10^-3 eV. But if the average energy is 10^-3 eV, then higher energy photons in the tail of the CMB distribution could interact with lower energy gamma-rays. Wait, no. The threshold would effectively use the lower energy photons to set the lower limit. But perhaps the correct thing is the average photon energy. Wait.

Wait, actually, the typical photon energy of the CMB is around kT, where T ≈ 2.7 K. The energy kT in eV is given by k = 8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K, so kT = 8.617e-5 * 2.7 ≈ 2.33 × 10^-4 eV. But sometimes people use the average photon energy, which is approximately 2.7 kT, so that would be ~6.3 × 10^-4 eV, close to 10^-3 eV as given in the problem.

But perhaps if we use kT = 2.35e-4 eV, so 2.7 kT = 6.3e-4 eV. Wait, but in the problem statement, the average is given as 10^-3 eV, so let's use that.

But regardless, based on the calculation, if the average photon energy is 10^-3 eV, then the threshold energy is E = (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon) = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ≈ 261 TeV.

But in reality, the cutoff for gamma-rays due to CMB interaction is known as the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin (GZK) limit. Wait, but the GZK limit is for protons interacting with CMB photons via pion production, but photons can interact via pair production. So I think there is a similar cutoff for photons. Let me confirm.

Yes, the extragalactic background light (EBL) and CMB can cause pair production attenuation for high-energy gamma-rays. The CMB is responsible for the absorption of the highest energy gamma-rays. The threshold for pair production is when the product of the gamma-ray energy E and the CMB photon energy ε exceeds (m_e c^2)^2. So as per the problem, this is correct.

The standard number given for the threshold energy for pair production on the CMB is indeed around 10^14 eV (100 TeV) or so. But sometimes it's quoted as about 80 TeV. Wait, perhaps because the actual calculation uses a more precise treatment.

Wait, but maybe they didn't assume head-on collisions. Because in reality, the cross-section for pair production is maximized when the photons are colliding head-on, but if they approach at some angle, the required energy would be higher. Alternatively, even if they approach at some angle, but the energy may be higher or lower. So maybe if we take into account the angle, we might get a lower threshold energy. Wait, no, the minimal energy required for pair production occurs when the collision is head-on. For non-head-on collisions, the required photon energy would be higher, so the head-on case gives the minimal energy required. Therefore, the threshold energy of 261 TeV is the minimal required energy for pair production to occur with a CMB photon of 1e-3 eV.

But perhaps the cross-section becomes significant around this energy. Therefore, the gamma-rays above 261 TeV would interact with the CMB photons and produce electron-positron pairs, thus limiting their lifetime in the universe.

But, in the literature, for example, the threshold energy for pair production on the CMB is often cited as ~10^14 eV or ~100 TeV. So, this calculation aligns with that. So unless there's a mistake in my calculation steps, this seems correct.

Therefore, the answer would be approximately 2.6 × 10^14 eV, or 260 TeV. But since sometimes we write in terms of exponents, 2.6 × 10^14 eV or maybe 1.6 × 10^14 eV (if the average photon energy used is higher), but given the problem states the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV, the calculation gives about 261 TeV. Let me check with precise numbers.

Using exact values:

m_e c^2 = 0.5109989461 MeV = 510998.9461 eV

epsilon (CMB photon) = 1e-3 eV

Threshold energy E = (510998.9461 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (510998.9461)^2 / 1e-3 eV

First compute (510998.9461)^2:

= (5.109989461 x 10^5)^2

= 5.109989461^2 x 10^10

= 26.1120162 x 10^10

Then, 26.1120162 x 10^10 / 1e-3 = 26.1120162 x 10^13 = 2.61120162 x 10^14 eV

Which is 261.12 TeV. So approximately 2.6x10^14 eV or 260 TeV.

So rounding to two significant figures, it's 2.6x10^14 eV, or 260 TeV.

Alternatively, since the problem says the average photon energy is 10^-3 eV, and the question asks "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes... limited by this process?" The answer is energies above this threshold. So the threshold itself is ~261 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays above this energy would start to have significant interactions with the CMB photons, leading to a limited lifetime in the universe.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 260 TeV, or 2.6 x 10^14 eV.

But perhaps considering significant figures, since the average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV, then 0.511 MeV squared divided by 1e-3 eV is approximately 2.6 x10^14 eV, so 260 TeV.

Alternatively, maybe 3 x 10^14 eV? But precise steps lead to 261, so probably needs to be specified as 2.6 x 10^14 eV. However, in some references, I’ve seen the photon-photon pair production threshold for CMB is around 10^14 eV (100 TeV). But in the end, perhaps the problem wants the exact calculation.

Therefore, given the problem's numbers, 0.511 MeV and 1e-3 eV, it's 261 TeV. So, put the answer in a box as \boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}} or TeV. But perhaps they want it in eV. Since the question states "From what energy gamma-rays...", the answer would be 2.6 x 10^14 eV. Alternatively, in TeV, 260 TeV. But since the given CMB energy is 1e-3 eV, using significant figures, it's better to write 2.6 x 10^{14} eV. Yes, I think that's the answer.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy at which gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons producing electron-positron pairs. The average energy of the CMB photon is given as 10^-3 eV. Hmm... Let me start by recalling what I know about this process.

The threshold condition for pair production (gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-) is given by the product of the energies of the two photons in the frame where the collision is head-on. So, if we have two photons with energies E1 and E2, and the angle between their momenta is θ, the threshold condition is:

E1 * E2 * (1 - cosθ) >= 2 (m_e c^2)^2

But for the case where the photons are moving directly towards each other (head-on collision), θ = 180 degrees, so cosθ = -1, so 1 - cosθ = 2. Therefore, the threshold simplifies to:

E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2

Wait, that seems simpler. So the product of their energies in the lab frame (if head-on) needs to be at least (m_e c^2)^2. But wait, is this the case?

Actually, I need to check if my understanding here is correct. Let me think. Let me recall that for two photons colliding head-on, the square of the center-of-mass energy s is given by:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1|c + |p2|c)^2

But since photons are massless, their energy is |p|c, so substituting p1 = E1/c and p2 = E2/c (but directions opposite), so the momentum vectors are opposite. Thus, the total momentum is (E1/c - E2/c) in magnitude. But depending on direction. Wait, actually when colliding head-on, their momenta are in opposite directions.

So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2, since p1 = E1/c and p2 = E2/c.

Calculating that: (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1² + 2E1E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2E1E2 + E2²] = 4E1E2

So s = 4E1E2

Then, for pair production to occur, the center-of-mass energy squared must be at least (2m_e c^2)^2, since the pair production requires creating two electrons (each m_e c^2). So, 4E1E2 >= (2m_e c^2)^2 => 4E1E2 >= 4(m_e c^2)^2 => E1E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2

Thus, yes, the product of the two photon energies must be at least equal to (m_e c^2)^2. So in the case of a head-on collision, the threshold condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Therefore, if we have one photon with energy E (the high-energy gamma-ray) and the other photon wi

I'm trying to determine at what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons that creates electron-positron pairs. The average CMB photon energy is 10^-3 eV. Let me work through this step by step.

This process involves a gamma-gamma collision producing an electron-positron pair. For this reaction to occur, the combined energy must equal at least the rest mass energy of an electron-positron pair, which is 1.022 MeV (0.511 MeV each). Since we're considering photons in different reference frames (a high-energy gamma-ray and a low-energy CMB photon), I need to analyze this in the appropriate frame.

For a head-on photon-photon collision, the threshold condition for pair production (gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-) can be expressed as a product of the energies. If two photons with energies E1 and E2 collide at an angle θ, the threshold condition is:

E1 * E2 * (1 - cosθ) >= 2 (m_e c^2)^2

In a direct head-on collision, θ = 180 degrees, so cosθ = -1, making (1 - cosθ) = 2. This simplifies our threshold condition to:

E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2

Let me verify this by calculating the center-of-mass energy squared (s) for two photons colliding head-on:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1|c + |p2|c)^2

Since photons are massless, E = pc, and for a head-on collision, the momenta are in opposite directions. So:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2
s = [E1² + 2E1E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2E1E2 + E2²]
s = 4E1E2

For pair production to occur, this center-of-mass energy squared must be at least (2m_e c^2)^2, since we need to create two particles. Therefore:

4E1E2 >= (2m_e c^2)^2
4E1E2 >= 4(m_e c^2)^2
E1E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2

This confirms that for a head-on collision, the threshold condition is indeed E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2, where one photon has energy E (the high-energy gamma-ray) and the other photon has

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I'm trying to determine the energy level at which gamma rays are limited in their lifetimes due to annihilation with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, resulting in the production of electron-positron pairs. The average energy of a CMB photon is specified as 10^-3 eV. Let me go over what I understand about the process.

This process involves a gamma-gamma collision that leads to electron-positron pair creation. For this to occur, the total energy of the two photons combined must match or exceed the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. Since the rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is 0.511 MeV, the combined energy required is 1.022 MeV. Given that we're dealing with photons in different reference frames—one being a high-energy gamma-ray and the other a low-energy CMB photon—we need to consider the center-of-momentum frame where their combined energy meets the required threshold.

Perhaps I should consider the situation as a head-on photon-photon collision. The condition for pair production mandates that the product of their energies in the center-of-mass frame meets the requirement (E1 * E2) >= (m_e c^2)^2. However, I might need to consider the cross-section threshold. I need to recall the formula for determining the threshold energy. 

For the pair production condition (gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-), the energies of the two photons in the frame where they collide head-on need to fulfill the condition:

E1 * E2 * (1 - cosθ) >= 2 (m_e c^2)^2

In the situation where the photons are moving directly towards each other (head-on collision), the angle θ between their momenta is 180 degrees, making cosθ = -1, hence 1 - cosθ = 2. Consequently, the threshold becomes:

E1 * E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2

That appears more straightforward. So, the product of their energies in the laboratory frame for a head-on collision needs to meet or exceed (m_e c^2)^2. But, is that correct?

Let me verify if my understanding is sound. For two photons colliding head-on, the square of the center-of-mass energy, denoted as s, is derived from:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1|c + |p2|c)^2

Given that photons have no mass, their energy is represented by |p|c. Substituting p1 = E1/c and p2 = E2/c, and because their momentum vectors are in opposite directions, the total momentum's magnitude is (E1/c - E2/c). However, upon head-on collision, their momenta are indeed oppositely directed.

Hence, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2 becomes (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2, with p1 = E1/c and p2 = E2/c. Calculating gives: (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = [E1² + 2E1E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2E1E2 + E2²] = 4E1E2. 

Therefore, s = 4E1E2. For pair production to occur, the squared center-of-mass energy must at least be (2m_e c^2)^2, because creating the pair necessitates forming two electrons, each having m_e c^2. Therefore: 4E1E2 >= (2m_e c^2)^2 => 4E1E2 >= 4(m_e c^2)^2 => E1E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So, indeed, the product of the energies of the two photons must at least equal (m_e c^2)^2. Consequently, for a head-on collision, the condition becomes E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Let me recalculate:\n\n(0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 = 0.511^2 × (10^6)^2 eV² = 0.261 × 10^12 eV²\n\nThen divide by ε (10^-3 eV):\n\n0.261 × 10^12 / 10^-3 = 0.261 × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV\n\nWhich is 2.61 × 10^14 eV, which is 261 TeV.\n\nBut wait, but the average energy of the CMB photon is 10^-3 eV. So in order for the product to reach (0.511 MeV)^2, which is about (0.5 MeV)^2 = 0.25 MeV², so with E in MeV, ε in eV:\n\nWait, maybe I should check units again. Hmm, m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so m_e c² = 0.511 × 10^6 eV. So (m_e c²)^2 = (0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 ≈ (0.261 × 10^12) eV².\n\nThen, ε = 10^-3 eV.\n\nSo E ≥ (0.261 × 10^12 eV²) / (10^-3 eV) = 0.261 × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nSo about 261 TeV.\n\nBut let me check: sometimes cross-section formulas could have factors of 2 perhaps based on angles.\n\nWait, but according to the threshold condition we derived earlier, it\'s E1*E2 >= (m_e c²)^2 here. So given that the CMB photon has energy ε, then E ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / ε.\n\nBut the phrase in the problem is "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So we need to find the energy where the gamma-rays start to interact significantly with CMB photons via pair production, thereby limiting their mean free path, hence their lifetime.\n\nBut perhaps the actual threshold is about 1 TeV? Wait, but according to this calculation, it\'s 261 TeV. Hmm, but I recall that the threshold for pair production on CMB photons is about 10^15 eV, but that might be for the infrared background.\n\nWait, perhaps the calculation is correct. Let me check order of magnitudes.\n\nFor example, m_e c² ~ 0.5 MeV.\n\nSo (m_e c²)^2 is (0.25 MeV²).\n\nCMB photon energy is 1e-3 eV.\n\nThus, gamma-ray photon energy E = (0.25 MeV²)/(1e-3 eV) = 0.25e12 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 0.25e15 eV = 250 TeV.\n\nSo yes, about 250 TeV.\n\nBut that seems very high. Wait, maybe this is the case for head-on collisions, which are the most efficient. However, in reality, the CMB photons have a thermal distribution, and the gamma-rays could collide with them at various angles. The cross-section for pair production is maximized when the collision is head-on, but even for other angles, as long as the product E1*E2*(1 - cosθ)/2 >= (m_e c²)^2, it can happen.\n\nWait, perhaps the original threshold formula for general angle is:\n\ns = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2, but with vectors. Wait, if they are at angle theta, then the scalar product of their momenta is p1 p2 c² cosθ.\n\nTherefore,\n\ns = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ⋅ cosθ ... Wait, actually the correct formula when the photons are moving at angle θ with respect to each other is:\n\ns = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ)\n\nYes, because the four-momentum squared would be (p1 + p2)^2 = p1^2 + p2^2 + 2 p1 ⋅ p2. Since photons are massless, p1^2 = p2^2 = 0, so s = 2 p1 ⋅ p2. In terms of energy and angle, since for photons, p = E/c, so we have p1 ⋅ p2 = E1 E2 / c^2 (1 - cosθ). Therefore, s = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ) / c^2. Wait, but normally, s is defined in units where c=1, so s = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ).\n\nTherefore, to have pair production, we need s >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. So,\n\n2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ) >= (2 m_e c^2)^2\n\nSo,\n\nE1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / [2 (1 - cosθ)]\n\n= 2 (m_e c^2)^2 / (1 - cosθ)\n\nTherefore, given that the maximum value of (1 - cosθ) is 2 (when theta=180 degrees) and the minimum is approaching 0 (theta approaching 0), but for average photons in the CMB, with thermal distribution, we need to see on average what angle they collide with the high-energy gamma.\n\nHowever, the problem states that we should consider the average photon energy of the CMB as 10^-3 eV. Perhaps it\'s an isotropic distribution, so we need to use the head-on approximation. But since we are to find the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process, meaning that the cross-section is significant. The cross-section for this process peaks near the threshold, so maybe the main contribution comes from photons that are moving in the opposite direction (head-on) with respect to the high-energy gamma-ray.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the typical calculation uses this head-on approximation to compute the threshold energy.\n\nIn that case, using the head-on collision (theta=180 degree) so that E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.\n\nThus, proceeding with that, with E2 = 1e-3 eV, solving for E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV).\n\nCalculating again:\n\n0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.\n\nsquared: (0.511e6)^2 = 0.261e12 eV²\n\nDivide by E2=1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 /1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV = 261e12 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nSo E1=261 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays above this energy would annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, losing energy and thus having their lifetimes limited.\n\nWait, but 261 TeV? That\'s like high-energy gamma-rays. The known universe\'s gamma-rays above a certain energy are indeed attenuated by the CMB. But according to some references, the threshold for pair production on CMB photons is around 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV. So here our calculation gives 261 TeV. Maybe it\'s correct. 261 TeV is approximately 2.6 × 10^14 eV, that\'s 0.26 PeV.\n\nBut perhaps the difference lies in the energy of CMB photons. The average CMB photon energy is ~ 6e-4 eV (since the CMB temperature is ~2.7 K, so average photon energy ~2.7 * k_B * T, k_B is Boltzmann constant. Wait no, the average energy for blackbody photons is about 2.7 k T, where kT at 2.7 K is approximately 0.23 meV (milli-eV). Wait, perhaps there\'s a mistake in the given average energy.\n\nWait, CMB has a temperature of about 2.725 K. The average photon energy for a blackbody spectrum is given by:\n\nE_avg = (3 k_B T) / (c^2 hbar^{-3} ) ... Wait, no. Wait, the average energy per photon for a blackbody is calculated as total energy density divided by photon number density.\n\nEnergy density of blackbody: u = (8π^5 k^4)/(15 c^3 h^3) T^4\n\nPhoton number density: n = (8π)/(c^3 h^3) (k T)^3 ζ(3) Γ(3)\n\nI might need to recall the exact numbers, but from standard references, for a blackbody at temperature T, the average photon energy is approximately 2.7 k_B T. So for T = 2.725 K,\n\nk_B T = 8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K * 2.725 K ≈ 2.35 × 10^-4 eV. Therefore, average photon energy ≈ 2.7 * 2.35e-4 eV ≈ 6.34e-4 eV, so about 0.6 meV. However, the problem states the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV. So maybe they\'re giving a slightly higher value for simplicity. Either way, maybe the calculation in the problem is okay. But it\'s better to go with the given 1e-3 eV. If in reality, the average is slightly lower, the threshold would be slightly higher. But let\'s go with the problem statement.\n\nSo with E2 = 1e-3 eV, we have E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 * 1e15 = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nTherefore, gamma-rays with energies above ~261 TeV would interact with CMB photons and produce pairs, hence their mean free path becomes limited by the universe. This is known as the threshold for the pair production against CMB photons, leading to the suppression of high-energy gamma rays from distant sources. This is part of the reason for the cosmic gamma-ray horizon.\n\nBut is there anything else I should consider here? The problem asks, "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So does this mean the energy above which the optical depth for gamma-rays becomes significant over cosmological distances? If so, the calculation gives the threshold energy. However, the actual gamma-ray horizon depends on the integral over distance of the interaction rate, which depends on the density of CMB photons and the cross-section as a function of energy.\n\nBut perhaps here, since the problem is likely asking for the threshold energy for the process to be possible, which we found to be 261 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays above that energy would have a high probability of annihilating with CMB photons, hence their lifetime (i.e., the time before they annihilate) would be limited by this process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is expected to utilize the average energy of the CMB photon, and perhaps account for the fact that not all collisions are head-on, thus requiring a higher energy to account for an average. However, given that the problem provides the average energy, and since pair production is possible for angles other than 180 degrees (as per the equation involving (1 - cosθ)), but most effective head-on. Therefore, when considering the average photon energy, but not specifying angles, perhaps the threshold is still given by that head-on collision. Otherwise, the energy would vary inversely with (1 - cosθ), but unless we know the angular distribution, it\'s hard to say. However, given that in the thermal bath of CMB, photons are isotropic, so the angle effect would average, leading to the cross-section being non-zero for certain energies. However, a standard calculation would use the head-on approximation for threshold estimation, leading to the 261 TeV.\n\nAlternatively, the energy of the gamma-ray in the CMB rest frame needs to see a CMB photon blueshifted enough. Wait, that might complicate things. Let\'s think: Suppose we have a high-energy gamma-ray of energy E, and the CMB photon has energy ε. In the lab frame (CMB rest frame), the gamma-ray has E, the CMB photon has ε. When considering the gamma-ray\'s rest frame, the CMB photon is blueshifted. Wait, but no, perhaps better to think in terms of the gamma-ray moving through the CMB, so the CMB photon appears blueshifted. The gamma-ray has a high energy E, so its Lorentz factor γ = E / (m_e c^2) if we consider the rest mass is m_e. Wait, but the gamma-ray is a photon, so it doesn\'t have a rest frame, but we can consider the frame where the gamma-ray is moving with some velocity, but photons move at c in all frames. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the rest frame of the CMB, the gamma-ray has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy ε. To produce e+ e-, the sum in energy must be enough. But as earlier. Alternatively, perhaps using the invariant quantity s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 = (sum energy)^2 - (sum momentum*c)^2.\n\nSince photons are massless, energy is |p|c, so given that, and that in the frame where they collide head-on, this gives s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.\n\nAlternatively, think about the energy required such that even the low-energy CMB photon provides enough energy in the center of mass to produce the pair. Since the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) must be at least 2 m_e c^2. So:\n\nsqrt(4 E E_cmb) >= 2 m_e c^2\n\nThen, sqrt(4 E ε) >= 2 * 0.511 MeV\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(E ε) >= 0.511 MeV\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nE ε >= (0.511 MeV)^2\n\nWhich brings us back to the same result as before. Therefore, the threshold calculation holds.\n\nThus, plugging in ε = 1e-3 eV.\n\nSo solving E >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 * 1e12) / 1e-3 eV = (0.261 * 1e15) eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nTherefore, the energy at which gamma-ray photons would start being attenuated by the CMB via pair production is around 261 TeV.\n\nJust to check, does this align with literature? Well, let\'s see. The "gamma-ray horizon" due to pair production on CMB photons is usually quoted around tens of TeV for extragalactic sources, depending on redshift. For example, gamma-rays above around 10 TeV have a mean free path less than the size of the observable universe, but actually at 10 TeV the mean free path is about 100 Mpc, which is much smaller than the Hubble length. But when you get up to higher energies like 100 TeV or a few hundred TeV, the mean free path becomes very small. So our threshold here gives 261 TeV as the absolute threshold. But interactions can occur at lower energies if the CMB photon is more energetic (even though the average is 1e-3 eV, the CMB has a thermal distribution with some photons at higher energies).\n\nHowever, the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. If we use that average, then the threshold is 261 TeV. But if you use the peak of the blackbody spectrum (at around 0.35 meV for CMB), maybe that affects it, but according to problem statement, the average is 1e-3 eV, so we should just go with the given value.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that gamma-rays with energies above approximately 260 TeV (2.6×10^14 eV) would have their lifetimes limited by pair production with CMB photons.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy at which gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited is \\boxed{261 \\text{ TeV}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744973343, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4170, prompt_tokens=1004, total_tokens=5174, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy at which gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons producing electron-positron pairs, we start by considering the threshold energy required for the process \(\gamma + \gamma \rightarrow e^+ + e^-\). 

The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Energy Condition**: The product of the energies of the two photons in a head-on collision must be at least equal to the square of the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. This condition is given by:
   \[
   E_{\gamma} \cdot E_{\text{CMB}} \geq (m_e c^2)^2
   \]
   where \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}\) is the rest mass energy of an electron, and \(E_{\text{CMB}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}\) is the average energy of a CMB photon.

2. **Calculating the Threshold Energy**:
   - Convert \(0.511 \, \text{MeV}\) to eV: \(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}\).
   - Square the rest mass energy: \((0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2 = 0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2\).
   - Solve for the gamma-ray energy \(E_{\gamma}\):
     \[
     E_{\gamma} \geq \frac{(0.511 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{0.261 \times 10^{12} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 0.261 \times 10^{15} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
     \]

3. **Conclusion**: The threshold energy for gamma-rays to annihilate with CMB photons is approximately \(261 \, \text{TeV}\). Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above this threshold will have their lifetimes limited by the pair production process.

\[
\boxed{261 \text{ TeV}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

energy ε (the CMB photon with ε ≈ 10^-3 eV), then the condition E * ε ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

But we need to find the energy E such that this is possible. So rearranging, E ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / ε

Plugging in the numbers:

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 0.511 × 10^6 eV

ε = 10^-3 eV

So E ≥ (0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 / (10^-3 eV) = (0.511)^2 × 10^12 eV² / 10^-3 eV = (0.261) × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV

Wait, how did I get 10^12? Let me recalculate:

(0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 = 0.511^2 × (10^6)^2 eV² = 0.261 × 10^12 eV²

Then divide by ε (10^-3 eV):

0.261 × 10^12 / 10^-3 = 0.261 × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV

Which is 2.61 × 10^14 eV, which is 261 TeV.

But wait, but the average energy of the CMB photon is 10^-3 eV. So in order for the product to reach (0.511 MeV)^2, which is about (0.5 MeV)^2 = 0.25 MeV², so with E in MeV, ε in eV:

Wait, maybe I should check units again. Hmm, m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, so m_e c² = 0.511 × 10^6 eV. So (m_e c²)^2 = (0.511 × 10^6 eV)^2 ≈ (0.261 × 10^12) eV².

Then, ε = 10^-3 eV.

So E ≥ (0.261 × 10^12 eV²) / (10^-3 eV) = 0.261 × 10^15 eV = 2.61 × 10^14 eV = 261 TeV.

So about 261 TeV.

But let me check: sometimes cross-section formulas could have factors of 2 perhaps based on angles.

Wait, but according to the threshold condition we derived earlier, it's E1*E2 >= (m_e c²)^2 here. So given that the CMB photon has energy ε, then E ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / ε.

But the phrase in the problem is "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So we need to find the energy where the gamma-rays start to interact significantly with CMB photons via pair production, thereby limiting their mean free path, hence their lifetime.

But perhaps the actual threshold is about 1 TeV? Wait, but according to this calculation, it's 261 TeV. Hmm, but I recall that the threshold for pair production on CMB photons is about 10^15 eV, but that might be for the infrared background.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct. Let me check order of magnitudes.

For example, m_e c² ~ 0.5 MeV.

So (m_e c²)^2 is (0.25 MeV²).

CMB photon energy is 1e-3 eV.

Thus, gamma-ray photon energy E = (0.25 MeV²)/(1e-3 eV) = 0.25e12 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 0.25e15 eV = 250 TeV.

So yes, about 250 TeV.

But that seems very high. Wait, maybe this is the case for head-on collisions, which are the most efficient. However, in reality, the CMB photons have a thermal distribution, and the gamma-rays could collide with them at various angles. The cross-section for pair production is maximized when the collision is head-on, but even for other angles, as long as the product E1*E2*(1 - cosθ)/2 >= (m_e c²)^2, it can happen.

Wait, perhaps the original threshold formula for general angle is:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2, but with vectors. Wait, if they are at angle theta, then the scalar product of their momenta is p1 p2 c² cosθ.

Therefore,

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ⋅ cosθ ... Wait, actually the correct formula when the photons are moving at angle θ with respect to each other is:

s = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ)

Yes, because the four-momentum squared would be (p1 + p2)^2 = p1^2 + p2^2 + 2 p1 ⋅ p2. Since photons are massless, p1^2 = p2^2 = 0, so s = 2 p1 ⋅ p2. In terms of energy and angle, since for photons, p = E/c, so we have p1 ⋅ p2 = E1 E2 / c^2 (1 - cosθ). Therefore, s = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ) / c^2. Wait, but normally, s is defined in units where c=1, so s = 2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ).

Therefore, to have pair production, we need s >= (2 m_e c^2)^2. So,

2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ) >= (2 m_e c^2)^2

So,

E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / [2 (1 - cosθ)]

= 2 (m_e c^2)^2 / (1 - cosθ)

Therefore, given that the maximum value of (1 - cosθ) is 2 (when theta=180 degrees) and the minimum is approaching 0 (theta approaching 0), but for average photons in the CMB, with thermal distribution, we need to see on average what angle they collide with the high-energy gamma.

However, the problem states that we should consider the average photon energy of the CMB as 10^-3 eV. Perhaps it's an isotropic distribution, so we need to use the head-on approximation. But since we are to find the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process, meaning that the cross-section is significant. The cross-section for this process peaks near the threshold, so maybe the main contribution comes from photons that are moving in the opposite direction (head-on) with respect to the high-energy gamma-ray.

Alternatively, perhaps the typical calculation uses this head-on approximation to compute the threshold energy.

In that case, using the head-on collision (theta=180 degree) so that E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Thus, proceeding with that, with E2 = 1e-3 eV, solving for E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2 = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV).

Calculating again:

0.511 MeV = 0.511e6 eV.

squared: (0.511e6)^2 = 0.261e12 eV²

Divide by E2=1e-3 eV: 0.261e12 /1e-3 = 0.261e15 eV = 261e12 eV = 261 TeV.

So E1=261 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays above this energy would annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, losing energy and thus having their lifetimes limited.

Wait, but 261 TeV? That's like high-energy gamma-rays. The known universe's gamma-rays above a certain energy are indeed attenuated by the CMB. But according to some references, the threshold for pair production on CMB photons is around 10^14 eV, which is 100 TeV. So here our calculation gives 261 TeV. Maybe it's correct. 261 TeV is approximately 2.6 × 10^14 eV, that's 0.26 PeV.

But perhaps the difference lies in the energy of CMB photons. The average CMB photon energy is ~ 6e-4 eV (since the CMB temperature is ~2.7 K, so average photon energy ~2.7 * k_B * T, k_B is Boltzmann constant. Wait no, the average energy for blackbody photons is about 2.7 k T, where kT at 2.7 K is approximately 0.23 meV (milli-eV). Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the given average energy.

Wait, CMB has a temperature of about 2.725 K. The average photon energy for a blackbody spectrum is given by:

E_avg = (3 k_B T) / (c^2 hbar^{-3} ) ... Wait, no. Wait, the average energy per photon for a blackbody is calculated as total energy density divided by photon number density.

Energy density of blackbody: u = (8π^5 k^4)/(15 c^3 h^3) T^4

Photon number density: n = (8π)/(c^3 h^3) (k T)^3 ζ(3) Γ(3)

I might need to recall the exact numbers, but from standard references, for a blackbody at temperature T, the average photon energy is approximately 2.7 k_B T. So for T = 2.725 K,

k_B T = 8.617 × 10^-5 eV/K * 2.725 K ≈ 2.35 × 10^-4 eV. Therefore, average photon energy ≈ 2.7 * 2.35e-4 eV ≈ 6.34e-4 eV, so about 0.6 meV. However, the problem states the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV. So maybe they're giving a slightly higher value for simplicity. Either way, maybe the calculation in the problem is okay. But it's better to go with the given 1e-3 eV. If in reality, the average is slightly lower, the threshold would be slightly higher. But let's go with the problem statement.

So with E2 = 1e-3 eV, we have E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 / 1e-3 = 0.261 * 1e15 = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.

Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above ~261 TeV would interact with CMB photons and produce pairs, hence their mean free path becomes limited by the universe. This is known as the threshold for the pair production against CMB photons, leading to the suppression of high-energy gamma rays from distant sources. This is part of the reason for the cosmic gamma-ray horizon.

But is there anything else I should consider here? The problem asks, "From what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So does this mean the energy above which the optical depth for gamma-rays becomes significant over cosmological distances? If so, the calculation gives the threshold energy. However, the actual gamma-ray horizon depends on the integral over distance of the interaction rate, which depends on the density of CMB photons and the cross-section as a function of energy.

But perhaps here, since the problem is likely asking for the threshold energy for the process to be possible, which we found to be 261 TeV. Therefore, gamma-rays above that energy would have a high probability of annihilating with CMB photons, hence their lifetime (i.e., the time before they annihilate) would be limited by this process.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is expected to utilize the average energy of the CMB photon, and perhaps account for the fact that not all collisions are head-on, thus requiring a higher energy to account for an average. However, given that the problem provides the average energy, and since pair production is possible for angles other than 180 degrees (as per the equation involving (1 - cosθ)), but most effective head-on. Therefore, when considering the average photon energy, but not specifying angles, perhaps the threshold is still given by that head-on collision. Otherwise, the energy would vary inversely with (1 - cosθ), but unless we know the angular distribution, it's hard to say. However, given that in the thermal bath of CMB, photons are isotropic, so the angle effect would average, leading to the cross-section being non-zero for certain energies. However, a standard calculation would use the head-on approximation for threshold estimation, leading to the 261 TeV.

Alternatively, the energy of the gamma-ray in the CMB rest frame needs to see a CMB photon blueshifted enough. Wait, that might complicate things. Let's think: Suppose we have a high-energy gamma-ray of energy E, and the CMB photon has energy ε. In the lab frame (CMB rest frame), the gamma-ray has E, the CMB photon has ε. When considering the gamma-ray's rest frame, the CMB photon is blueshifted. Wait, but no, perhaps better to think in terms of the gamma-ray moving through the CMB, so the CMB photon appears blueshifted. The gamma-ray has a high energy E, so its Lorentz factor γ = E / (m_e c^2) if we consider the rest mass is m_e. Wait, but the gamma-ray is a photon, so it doesn't have a rest frame, but we can consider the frame where the gamma-ray is moving with some velocity, but photons move at c in all frames. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe in the rest frame of the CMB, the gamma-ray has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy ε. To produce e+ e-, the sum in energy must be enough. But as earlier. Alternatively, perhaps using the invariant quantity s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 = (sum energy)^2 - (sum momentum*c)^2.

Since photons are massless, energy is |p|c, so given that, and that in the frame where they collide head-on, this gives s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.

Alternatively, think about the energy required such that even the low-energy CMB photon provides enough energy in the center of mass to produce the pair. Since the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) must be at least 2 m_e c^2. So:

sqrt(4 E E_cmb) >= 2 m_e c^2

Then, sqrt(4 E ε) >= 2 * 0.511 MeV

Divide both sides by 2:

sqrt(E ε) >= 0.511 MeV

Square both sides:

E ε >= (0.511 MeV)^2

Which brings us back to the same result as before. Therefore, the threshold calculation holds.

Thus, plugging in ε = 1e-3 eV.

So solving E >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511^2 * 1e12) / 1e-3 eV = (0.261 * 1e15) eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.

Therefore, the energy at which gamma-ray photons would start being attenuated by the CMB via pair production is around 261 TeV.

Just to check, does this align with literature? Well, let's see. The "gamma-ray horizon" due to pair production on CMB photons is usually quoted around tens of TeV for extragalactic sources, depending on redshift. For example, gamma-rays above around 10 TeV have a mean free path less than the size of the observable universe, but actually at 10 TeV the mean free path is about 100 Mpc, which is much smaller than the Hubble length. But when you get up to higher energies like 100 TeV or a few hundred TeV, the mean free path becomes very small. So our threshold here gives 261 TeV as the absolute threshold. But interactions can occur at lower energies if the CMB photon is more energetic (even though the average is 1e-3 eV, the CMB has a thermal distribution with some photons at higher energies).

However, the problem states the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. If we use that average, then the threshold is 261 TeV. But if you use the peak of the blackbody spectrum (at around 0.35 meV for CMB), maybe that affects it, but according to problem statement, the average is 1e-3 eV, so we should just go with the given value.

Therefore, my conclusion is that gamma-rays with energies above approximately 260 TeV (2.6×10^14 eV) would have their lifetimes limited by pair production with CMB photons.

**Final Answer**
The energy at which gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited is \boxed{261 \text{ TeV}}.

Because the threshold photon energy when interacting with a thermal photon.\n\nWait another thing: The cross-section for this process is not exactly at threshold. The peak cross-section occurs when the photons have energies such that their product satisfies the threshold condition. So, the photons below this energy cannot produce pairs, and above can. So, the gamma-rays with energy exceeding E >= (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon) (obtained from rearranging the threshold formula)\n\nSo directly, E_threshold = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon\n\nm_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, so squared is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² = 0.261 * 1e12 = 2.61e11 eV²\n\nDivide by epsilon, given as 1e-3 eV:\n\nThreshold energy E_threshold = 2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV, which is 261 TeV.\n\nIs that the answer? So gamma-rays above this energy would interact with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, thus their mean free path would be limited by this interaction.\n\nBut the problem is phrased: "From what energy γ-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?"\n\nTherefore, gamma-rays above this threshold would have their lifetimes limited by pair production on the CMB. However, given that the cross-section does not go to zero rapidly below threshold, but turns off at threshold. But in practice, the effective threshold is around hundreds of TeV for the CMB\'s photon energy. Therefore, photons with energies higher than this threshold cannot travel cosmological distances without being attenuated by the CMB. So, their lifetime (or propagation distance) is limited by this process. Therefore, the answer is approx. hundreds of TeV.\n\nGiven the calculation, 261 TeV, which is 2.61e14 eV, so perhaps written as ~3 ×10^14 eV or 300 TeV.\n\nWait I compute 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV. Squared is (5.11e5)^2 = 26.1121e10 eV^2. Let me verify again:\n\n(5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 = 26.1121 * 1e10 eV², so 2.61121e11 eV².\n\nThen divide by epsilon =1e-3 eV:\n\n2.61121e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61121e14 eV ≈ 261.121 TeV.\n\nHence, the threshold energy E is about 260 TeV, so roughly 3 ×10^14 eV. However, the options are probably asking for the answer in regular notation. So normally, this is known as the "threshold energy for pair production on the CMB". The standard result is indeed about ~10^14 eV, 100 TeV. But accurate value is around 100-300 TeV?\n\nWait self: Let me see. The commonly quoted threshold for EBL (Extragalactic Background Light) or CMB for pair production. The CMB\'s photon density is significant, and the threshold energy to pair produce with CMB photons is indeed around 1e14 eV (100 TeV). However, precise calculation gives about 260 TeV? Perhaps confused between CMB and other photon fields.\n\nWait no, perhaps the cross-section peaks above the threshold, so even if the threshold is 260 TeV, the optical depth becomes significant above this. But how does this relate to the question?\n\nHowever, perhaps the calculation I did is correct. For the threshold energy, E_threshold = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon. Given that m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, calculated, gives approx 261 TeV, so accurate.\n\nHence, the answer is approximately 260 TeV, which is 2.6e14 eV, but since the CMB photon has 1e-3 eV, the calculation gives close to this number.\n\nBut maybe we need to consider the angle averaging. However, the threshold condition assumed head-on collision (θ=π), which gives the maximum possible product. If the collision is at an angle, the (1 - cosθ) term means that even for the same photon energies, if they collide at a different angle, the energy needed could be lower or higher. But since CMB photons are isotropic, we need to compute an effective threshold.\n\nWait again! The problem says "average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV" but the CMB photons are a thermal distribution.\n\nIn that case, perhaps use more properly an approximated typical photon-photon collision, but maybe the previous calculation is the standard approach. Let me check the standard approach for pair production on the CMB.\n\nAccording to references, the threshold energy for pair production with the CMB occurs when the energy of the gamma-ray is E_gamma ~ m_e^2 c^4 / (epsilon * (1 + z)^2), where z is the redshift. But at z=0 (now), E_gamma ~ m_e^2 c^4 / epsilon.\n\nTherefore, E_gamma = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.261e12) / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nHence, the standard answer would be around (m_ec^2)^2/(epsilon_CMB). For more accuracy and references, the threshold energy for pair production is given by E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 ε), but wait some sources use a factor. Wait, wait:\n\nWait another view. In the center-of-momentum frame, the two photons each need to provide enough energy for creating at rest electron and positron, but that would be E_1 + E_2 = 2m_e c^2. But when approaching from opposite directions, their total momentum is p1 - p2 (if head-on). Since E1 = p1 c, E2 = p2 c. Total energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.\n\nThis must equal at least (2 m_e c^2)^2. Therefore, 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 => E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.\n\nSo if one photon is of energy E_gamma and the other is of energy ε, then:\n\nE_gamma * ε >= (m_e c^2)^2.\n\nTherefore, solving for the threshold:\n\nE_gamma_threshold = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε.\n\nSo with the values given, that becomes (0.511 MeV)^2 / 1e-3 eV.\n\nCalculating step-wise:\n\n0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.\n\nSo (511,000)^2 = 511*10^3 *511*10^3 = (511^2) * 10^6. 511^2 is 261,121, so 261,121 * 1e6 = 261,121,000,000 eV².\n\nTherefore, E_gamma_threshold = 261,121,000,000 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 261,121,000,000 / 0.001 eV = 261,121,000,000,000 eV = 2.61121e14 eV = 261.121 TeV ≈ 260 TeV.\n\nTherefore, gamma-rays with energies above approximately 260 TeV (2.6e14 eV) will undergo pair production when interacting with CMB photons. So their propagation distance (i.e., their lifetime in terms of attenuation by the universe) would be limited by this process. This is known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, although the GZK limit specifically refers to high-energy protons interacting with the CMB. But for photons, the mechanism is similar but the interaction is with the infrared background (EBL) and CMB. For photons, the CMB provides a lower energy threshold, around ~1e14 eV (100 TeV), but precise is ~260 TeV. However, different sources might approximate differently. Wait but the GZK photon cutoff is lower, but maybe not. Wait, no: You have pair production via two photons. For gamma-rays, the integrated infrared, optical, and CMB photons contribute to the opacity. However, the CMB photons are the most numerous with ~1 mm wavelength, but low energy (meV). But according to the threshold, the highest threshold is for the CMB (since it\'s the lowest energy photon field). Wait, highest energy gamma-rays must pair produce with lowest energy photons (since E_gamma * ε ~ m_e^2 c^4).\n\nWait, given that, gamma-rays of a high energy need a low energy photon to pair produce. However, the number density decreases with higher energy (but CMB photon number density is high, but individual photons have low energy). Therefore, the threshold for CMB is at ~1e14 eV (depends on redshift, but today ~ 260 TeV). Thus, you cannot have gamma-rays above that without interacting.\n\nBut the problem says, "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So any gamma above that (260 TeV) would interact. So the gamma-rays with energy greater than 260 TeV are absorbed by the CMB, hence their mean free path is ~tens of Mpc. So for gamma-rays with higher energies, they can\'t come from cosmological distances. Hence, the \'lifetime\' would be limited by this process starting at ~260 TeV.\n\nSo if the average energy of CMB photon is 10^-3 eV, then the calculation above gives Egamma = ~260 TeV. Another way, maybe a factor of 2 comes in.\n\nWait, wait. Because in the center-of-mass frame, the threshold requires that the total energy is twice the rest mass. Wait, initial system is two photons, which have a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = sqrt(4 E ε). For production of e+e-, the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2 m_e c². So sqrt(4 E ε) >= 2 m_e c². So sqrt(E ε) >= m_e c², so E ε >= (m_e c²)^2. Which is the exact same equation. Thus, the initial assessment seems correct, that there\'s no factor missing. Therefore, answer is 261 TeV, which is about 2.6e14 eV.\n\nBut let\'s verify the numbers again with exact calculation:\n\n(m_e c^2)^2 / ε:\n\nm_e = 0.511 MeV/c²\n\nBut let\'s use constants:\n\nm_e c² = 0.5109989461 MeV (from CODATA)\n\nTherefore, (m_e c²)^2 = (0.5109989461)^2 (MeV)^2 ≈ 0.26112 (MeV)^2\n\nConvert ε = 1e-3 eV = 0.001 eV\n\nSo (m_e c²)^2 in (eV)^2 is (0.5109989461e6 eV)^2 ≈ 261,121,535,852 eV² ≈ 2.6112e11 eV²\n\nDivide by ε in eV: E = 2.6112e11 eV² / 1e-3 eV ≈ 2.6112e14 eV = 261.12 TeV ≈ 261 TeV\n\nSo that\'s 2.61e14 eV. So the answer is approximately 2.6 x 10^14 eV, which is 260 TeV.\n\nBut the question says "From what energy γ-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So when the energy exceeds ~260 TeV, high-energy gamma-rays would start pair-producing with CMB photons, leading to a limited mean free path. Thus, the threshold is ~260 TeV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is about 2.6e14 eV. The question specifies E in energy, so writing \\boxed{10^{14} \\text{ eV}} is perhaps too approximate, but unless the correct exact answer is possible, the calculation gives ~260 TeV.\n\nBut perhaps in terms of order of magnitude, it\'s 10^14 eV (100 TeV). But 10^14 eV is 100 TeV. But precise is 260 TeV, which is 2.6e14 eV.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the Planck units, but likely:\n\nThe problem gives the average energy of CMB as 1e-3 eV, so the calculation yields E = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV =  (0.26112e12 eV^2) / 1e-3 eV = 2.6112e14 eV.\n\nTherefore, converting to TeV:\n\n1 TeV = 1e12 eV, so 2.6112e14 eV = 261.12 TeV ≈ 260 TeV.\n\nSo the precise answer is ~260 TeV, but how precise do we need to be? The problem doesn\'t specify whether it wants exponent or an approximate in eV.\n\nBut given that\'s 2.6e14 eV. Thus, the answer is approximately 2.6 × 10^14 eV. But in some references, like Wikipedia pair production, for CMB photons, the threshold is of order ~1e15 eV (which would be if higher), but perhaps with different CMB photon temp?\n\nWait, but the average energy for a CMB photon (blackbody spectrum at ~2.7 K). The average photon energy for blackbody radiation is approximately 2.7kT, right?\n\nThe CMB temperature is about T ≈ 2.725 K.\n\nk (Boltzmann constant) is 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nTherefore, average photon energy ε_avg ≈ 2.7 * k * T ≈ 2.7 * 8.617e-5 eV/K * 2.725 K ≈ 2.7 * 8.617e-5 *2.725 ≈ Let\'s compute it step-wise:\n\nFirstly, 8.617e-5 eV/K * 2.725 K ≈ 8.617e-5 * 2.725 ≈ 2.348e-4 eV.\n\nThen multiply by 2.7: 2.348e-4 eV * 2.7 ≈ 6.34e-4 eV ≈ 6.3e-4 eV. However, the problem states the average as 1e-3 eV. Maybe the problem\'s value is approximate. Let\'s check:\n\nThe average energy for blackbody radiation is given by 〈E〉 =  (π^4 / (30 ζ(3))) kT ≈ 2.701 kT.\n\nSo kT = (8.617e-5 eV/K)(2.725 K) ≈ 2.348e-4 eV.\n\nThen 〈E〉 ≈ 2.701 * 2.348e-4 eV ≈ 6.34e-4 eV ≈ 6.3x10^-4 eV. But problem says the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV, so there\'s a discrepancy here. Perhaps the problem is using a different convention, maybe taking the peak energy (which is about 1.6kT) but then multiplied by something?\n\nIf that\'s the case, the problem gives 1e-3 eV, so probably accepts using that value regardless. So proceeding with the problem\'s ε =1e-3 eV, perhaps it\'s a rounded-up value, or uses different approximation.\n\nTherefore, given that, even if the accurate average is 6e-4 eV using 1e-3 eV as problem\'s stated value, so proceed to calculate E = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = 261 TeV.\n\nThus, the answer, if to be presented in eV, is 2.6e14 eV. Written in standard form:\n\n\\boxed{2.6 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ eV}}\n\nAlternatively, as 260 TeV. But if write in box as per the exponent requested.\n\nAnother way: If the question prefers in EeV (1e18 eV), but 2.6e14 eV is 0.26 EeV. More standard is TeV. Depending on the user\'s region. But according to the problem\'s given average energy in eV, perhaps keep the answer in eV.\n\nBut let me check if historically, this might be considered, but I think  Order of ~1e14 eV is considered 100 TeV. Thus 2.6e14 eV is 260 TeV, which in the problem\'s required units would box 2.6e14 eV, or with two significant figures.\n\nBut since the calculations start with approximate numbers (given average energy 1e-3 eV), writing either 3e14 eV or 2.6e14 eV. Probably safer to present as 2.6 x 10^14 eV, but if rounded, possible ≈3 x 10^14 eV. But given that 0.261 /0.001 is exactly 261. So maybe exact is 261, but written as 2.6 × 10² TeV or 2.6e14 eV.\n\nThus, my final answer is about 2.6 x 10^14 eV.

To determine the energy at which gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons (producing electron-positron pairs), we start with the threshold condition for this process. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Condition**: The product of the energies of the two photons must equal at least the square of the rest mass energy of an electron-positron pair. For a head-on collision, this is given by:
   \[
   E \cdot \epsilon \geq (m_e c^2)^2
   \]
   where \(E\) is the energy of the high-energy gamma-ray, \(\epsilon\) is the energy of the CMB photon, \(m_e\) is the electron mass, and \(c\) is the speed of light.

2. **Given Values**: The average energy of a CMB photon is \(\epsilon = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}\). The rest mass energy of an electron is \(m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV}\).

3. **Calculation**:
   - Compute \((m_e c^2)^2\):
     \[
     (511,000 \, \text{eV})^2 = (511)^2 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}^2 = 261,121 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}^2 = 2.61121 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2
     \]
   - Solve for \(E\) using the threshold condition:
     \[
     E \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{\epsilon} = \frac{2.61121 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61121 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
     \]

Thus, gamma-rays with an energy of approximately \(2.6 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}\) (or 260 TeV) or higher would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process with CMB photons.

\[
\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}
\]

energy ε (the CMB photon). The average CMB photon has ε = 1e-3 eV.

So, plugging in the numbers:

E * 1e-3 eV >= (511 keV)^2
First, convert 511 keV to eV: 511,000 eV

So,

E * 1e-3 eV >= (511,000 eV)^2
E >= (511,000)^2 / 1e-3 eV
Compute (511,000)^2 = 511^2 * 1e6 = 261,121 * 1e6 = 2.61121e11 (eV)^2
So, E >= (2.61121e11 eV^2) / 1e-3 eV = 2.61121e14 eV = 2.61e14 eV

Wait, 2.61e14 eV is 261 TeV.

But wait, perhaps factor of 2? Because the threshold photon energy when interacting with a thermal photon.

Wait another thing: The cross-section for this process is not exactly at threshold. The peak cross-section occurs when the photons have energies such that their product satisfies the threshold condition. So, the photons below this energy cannot produce pairs, and above can. So, the gamma-rays with energy exceeding E >= (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon) (obtained from rearranging the threshold formula)

So directly, E_threshold = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon

m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, so squared is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV² = 0.261 * 1e12 = 2.61e11 eV²

Divide by epsilon, given as 1e-3 eV:

Threshold energy E_threshold = 2.61e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV, which is 261 TeV.

Is that the answer? So gamma-rays above this energy would interact with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs, thus their mean free path would be limited by this interaction.

But the problem is phrased: "From what energy γ-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?"

Therefore, gamma-rays above this threshold would have their lifetimes limited by pair production on the CMB. However, given that the cross-section does not go to zero rapidly below threshold, but turns off at threshold. But in practice, the effective threshold is around hundreds of TeV for the CMB's photon energy. Therefore, photons with energies higher than this threshold cannot travel cosmological distances without being attenuated by the CMB. So, their lifetime (or propagation distance) is limited by this process. Therefore, the answer is approx. hundreds of TeV.

Given the calculation, 261 TeV, which is 2.61e14 eV, so perhaps written as ~3 ×10^14 eV or 300 TeV.

Wait I compute 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV. Squared is (5.11e5)^2 = 26.1121e10 eV^2. Let me verify again:

(5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11)^2 * 1e10 = 26.1121 * 1e10 eV², so 2.61121e11 eV².

Then divide by epsilon =1e-3 eV:

2.61121e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61121e14 eV ≈ 261.121 TeV.

Hence, the threshold energy E is about 260 TeV, so roughly 3 ×10^14 eV. However, the options are probably asking for the answer in regular notation. So normally, this is known as the "threshold energy for pair production on the CMB". The standard result is indeed about ~10^14 eV, 100 TeV. But accurate value is around 100-300 TeV?

Wait self: Let me see. The commonly quoted threshold for EBL (Extragalactic Background Light) or CMB for pair production. The CMB's photon density is significant, and the threshold energy to pair produce with CMB photons is indeed around 1e14 eV (100 TeV). However, precise calculation gives about 260 TeV? Perhaps confused between CMB and other photon fields.

Wait no, perhaps the cross-section peaks above the threshold, so even if the threshold is 260 TeV, the optical depth becomes significant above this. But how does this relate to the question?

However, perhaps the calculation I did is correct. For the threshold energy, E_threshold = (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon. Given that m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV, calculated, gives approx 261 TeV, so accurate.

Hence, the answer is approximately 260 TeV, which is 2.6e14 eV, but since the CMB photon has 1e-3 eV, the calculation gives close to this number.

But maybe we need to consider the angle averaging. However, the threshold condition assumed head-on collision (θ=π), which gives the maximum possible product. If the collision is at an angle, the (1 - cosθ) term means that even for the same photon energies, if they collide at a different angle, the energy needed could be lower or higher. But since CMB photons are isotropic, we need to compute an effective threshold.

Wait again! The problem says "average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV" but the CMB photons are a thermal distribution.

In that case, perhaps use more properly an approximated typical photon-photon collision, but maybe the previous calculation is the standard approach. Let me check the standard approach for pair production on the CMB.

According to references, the threshold energy for pair production with the CMB occurs when the energy of the gamma-ray is E_gamma ~ m_e^2 c^4 / (epsilon * (1 + z)^2), where z is the redshift. But at z=0 (now), E_gamma ~ m_e^2 c^4 / epsilon.

Therefore, E_gamma = (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 eV = (0.261e12) / 1e-3 = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.

Hence, the standard answer would be around (m_ec^2)^2/(epsilon_CMB). For more accuracy and references, the threshold energy for pair production is given by E_γ = (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 ε), but wait some sources use a factor. Wait, wait:

Wait another view. In the center-of-momentum frame, the two photons each need to provide enough energy for creating at rest electron and positron, but that would be E_1 + E_2 = 2m_e c^2. But when approaching from opposite directions, their total momentum is p1 - p2 (if head-on). Since E1 = p1 c, E2 = p2 c. Total energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 = 4 E1 E2.

This must equal at least (2 m_e c^2)^2. Therefore, 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 => E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

So if one photon is of energy E_gamma and the other is of energy ε, then:

E_gamma * ε >= (m_e c^2)^2.

Therefore, solving for the threshold:

E_gamma_threshold = (m_e c^2)^2 / ε.

So with the values given, that becomes (0.511 MeV)^2 / 1e-3 eV.

Calculating step-wise:

0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV.

So (511,000)^2 = 511*10^3 *511*10^3 = (511^2) * 10^6. 511^2 is 261,121, so 261,121 * 1e6 = 261,121,000,000 eV².

Therefore, E_gamma_threshold = 261,121,000,000 eV² / 1e-3 eV = 261,121,000,000 / 0.001 eV = 261,121,000,000,000 eV = 2.61121e14 eV = 261.121 TeV ≈ 260 TeV.

Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above approximately 260 TeV (2.6e14 eV) will undergo pair production when interacting with CMB photons. So their propagation distance (i.e., their lifetime in terms of attenuation by the universe) would be limited by this process. This is known as the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, although the GZK limit specifically refers to high-energy protons interacting with the CMB. But for photons, the mechanism is similar but the interaction is with the infrared background (EBL) and CMB. For photons, the CMB provides a lower energy threshold, around ~1e14 eV (100 TeV), but precise is ~260 TeV. However, different sources might approximate differently. Wait but the GZK photon cutoff is lower, but maybe not. Wait, no: You have pair production via two photons. For gamma-rays, the integrated infrared, optical, and CMB photons contribute to the opacity. However, the CMB photons are the most numerous with ~1 mm wavelength, but low energy (meV). But according to the threshold, the highest threshold is for the CMB (since it's the lowest energy photon field). Wait, highest energy gamma-rays must pair produce with lowest energy photons (since E_gamma * ε ~ m_e^2 c^4).

Wait, given that, gamma-rays of a high energy need a low energy photon to pair produce. However, the number density decreases with higher energy (but CMB photon number density is high, but individual photons have low energy). Therefore, the threshold for CMB is at ~1e14 eV (depends on redshift, but today ~ 260 TeV). Thus, you cannot have gamma-rays above that without interacting.

But the problem says, "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So any gamma above that (260 TeV) would interact. So the gamma-rays with energy greater than 260 TeV are absorbed by the CMB, hence their mean free path is ~tens of Mpc. So for gamma-rays with higher energies, they can't come from cosmological distances. Hence, the 'lifetime' would be limited by this process starting at ~260 TeV.

So if the average energy of CMB photon is 10^-3 eV, then the calculation above gives Egamma = ~260 TeV. Another way, maybe a factor of 2 comes in.

Wait, wait. Because in the center-of-mass frame, the threshold requires that the total energy is twice the rest mass. Wait, initial system is two photons, which have a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = sqrt(4 E ε). For production of e+e-, the center-of-mass energy must be at least 2 m_e c². So sqrt(4 E ε) >= 2 m_e c². So sqrt(E ε) >= m_e c², so E ε >= (m_e c²)^2. Which is the exact same equation. Thus, the initial assessment seems correct, that there's no factor missing. Therefore, answer is 261 TeV, which is about 2.6e14 eV.

But let's verify the numbers again with exact calculation:

(m_e c^2)^2 / ε:

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c²

But let's use constants:

m_e c² = 0.5109989461 MeV (from CODATA)

Therefore, (m_e c²)^2 = (0.5109989461)^2 (MeV)^2 ≈ 0.26112 (MeV)^2

Convert ε = 1e-3 eV = 0.001 eV

So (m_e c²)^2 in (eV)^2 is (0.5109989461e6 eV)^2 ≈ 261,121,535,852 eV² ≈ 2.6112e11 eV²

Divide by ε in eV: E = 2.6112e11 eV² / 1e-3 eV ≈ 2.6112e14 eV = 261.12 TeV ≈ 261 TeV

So that's 2.61e14 eV. So the answer is approximately 2.6 x 10^14 eV, which is 260 TeV.

But the question says "From what energy γ-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So when the energy exceeds ~260 TeV, high-energy gamma-rays would start pair-producing with CMB photons, leading to a limited mean free path. Thus, the threshold is ~260 TeV.

Therefore, the answer is about 2.6e14 eV. The question specifies E in energy, so writing \boxed{10^{14} \text{ eV}} is perhaps too approximate, but unless the correct exact answer is possible, the calculation gives ~260 TeV.

But perhaps in terms of order of magnitude, it's 10^14 eV (100 TeV). But 10^14 eV is 100 TeV. But precise is 260 TeV, which is 2.6e14 eV.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the Planck units, but likely:

The problem gives the average energy of CMB as 1e-3 eV, so the calculation yields E = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV =  (0.26112e12 eV^2) / 1e-3 eV = 2.6112e14 eV.

Therefore, converting to TeV:

1 TeV = 1e12 eV, so 2.6112e14 eV = 261.12 TeV ≈ 260 TeV.

So the precise answer is ~260 TeV, but how precise do we need to be? The problem doesn't specify whether it wants exponent or an approximate in eV.

But given that's 2.6e14 eV. Thus, the answer is approximately 2.6 × 10^14 eV. But in some references, like Wikipedia pair production, for CMB photons, the threshold is of order ~1e15 eV (which would be if higher), but perhaps with different CMB photon temp?

Wait, but the average energy for a CMB photon (blackbody spectrum at ~2.7 K). The average photon energy for blackbody radiation is approximately 2.7kT, right?

The CMB temperature is about T ≈ 2.725 K.

k (Boltzmann constant) is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

Therefore, average photon energy ε_avg ≈ 2.7 * k * T ≈ 2.7 * 8.617e-5 eV/K * 2.725 K ≈ 2.7 * 8.617e-5 *2.725 ≈ Let's compute it step-wise:

Firstly, 8.617e-5 eV/K * 2.725 K ≈ 8.617e-5 * 2.725 ≈ 2.348e-4 eV.

Then multiply by 2.7: 2.348e-4 eV * 2.7 ≈ 6.34e-4 eV ≈ 6.3e-4 eV. However, the problem states the average as 1e-3 eV. Maybe the problem's value is approximate. Let's check:

The average energy for blackbody radiation is given by 〈E〉 =  (π^4 / (30 ζ(3))) kT ≈ 2.701 kT.

So kT = (8.617e-5 eV/K)(2.725 K) ≈ 2.348e-4 eV.

Then 〈E〉 ≈ 2.701 * 2.348e-4 eV ≈ 6.34e-4 eV ≈ 6.3x10^-4 eV. But problem says the average photon energy of the CMB is 1e-3 eV, so there's a discrepancy here. Perhaps the problem is using a different convention, maybe taking the peak energy (which is about 1.6kT) but then multiplied by something?

If that's the case, the problem gives 1e-3 eV, so probably accepts using that value regardless. So proceeding with the problem's ε =1e-3 eV, perhaps it's a rounded-up value, or uses different approximation.

Therefore, given that, even if the accurate average is 6e-4 eV using 1e-3 eV as problem's stated value, so proceed to calculate E = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 = 261 TeV.

Thus, the answer, if to be presented in eV, is 2.6e14 eV. Written in standard form:

\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}

Alternatively, as 260 TeV. But if write in box as per the exponent requested.

Another way: If the question prefers in EeV (1e18 eV), but 2.6e14 eV is 0.26 EeV. More standard is TeV. Depending on the user's region. But according to the problem's given average energy in eV, perhaps keep the answer in eV.

But let me check if historically, this might be considered, but I think  Order of ~1e14 eV is considered 100 TeV. Thus 2.6e14 eV is 260 TeV, which in the problem's required units would box 2.6e14 eV, or with two significant figures.

But since the calculations start with approximate numbers (given average energy 1e-3 eV), writing either 3e14 eV or 2.6e14 eV. Probably safer to present as 2.6 x 10^14 eV, but if rounded, possible ≈3 x 10^14 eV. But given that 0.261 /0.001 is exactly 261. So maybe exact is 261, but written as 2.6 × 10² TeV or 2.6e14 eV.

Thus, my final answer is about 2.6 x 10^14 eV. So written as:

**Final Answer**
\boxed{2.6 \times 10^{14} \text{ eV}}

Wait, hold on, the problem states the average CMB photon energy is 10^-3 eV. Therefore, we need to find the minimum gamma-ray energy (E_gamma) such that when combined with the CMB photon (E_CMB = 10^-3 eV), the product E_gamma * E_CMB ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.\n\nWait, but c^2 is a unit conversion.

Therefore, (m_e c^2)^2 = (511,000 eV)^2 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2.\n\nSo the product E_gamma * E_CMB = E_gamma * 1e-3 eV ≥ 2.61e11 (eV)^2.\n\nHence, solving for E_gamma:\n\nE_gamma ≥ 2.61e11 (eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nTherefore, gamma-rays with energies above approximately 261 TeV would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process. That seems like a very high energy. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, but when considering the cross-section, the threshold is when gamma-rays have energy such that when colliding with CMB photons, the center-of-mass energy is enough to produce the electron-positron pair. However, in reality, because the CMB photons are low-energy, the required gamma-ray energy is indeed in the hundreds of TeV. \n\nThis also relates to the "gamma-ray horizon," beyond which high-energy gamma-rays from distant sources are attenuated due to pair production with the CMB. So, 261 TeV might not be exactly the threshold but I need to confirm the method.\n\nBut the calculation results in 261 TeV. Let\'s check more exactly.\n\nFirst, confirm m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV. Correct. So (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2.\n\nThe product E1*E2 ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2.\n\nBut E2 is 1e-3 eV. First, convert the MeV to eV:\n\n0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 1e6 eV = 511,000 eV.\n\nSo, (0.511 MeV)^2 = (511,000 eV)^2 = 511,000^2 eV^2 = 261,121,000,000 eV^2 ≈ 2.61e11 eV^2.\n\nThus, requiring E_gamma (eV) * 1e-3 eV ≥ 2.61e11 eV^2.\n\nSo, E_gamma ≥ (2.61e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.61e14 eV.\n\nConvert eV to TeV: 1 TeV = 1e12 eV, so 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.\n\nTherefore, the energy threshold is approximately 261 TeV.\n\nBut it\'s important to note that the actual threshold might depend on other factors such as the angle of collision. The above calculation assumes a head-on collision (θ = 180 degrees), which gives the minimum required energies. If the photons collide at a different angle, the required energy would be higher. But since the CMB photons are isotropic, the calculation typically uses the head-on collision as the threshold, which gives the maximum possible cross-section (if the photon is moving in the opposite direction relative to the gamma-ray), hence the most efficient case. Therefore, that\'s considered as the energy at which the gamma-ray\'s mean free path becomes significantly limited.\n\nHowever, the problem states "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So, perhaps the concept here is the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) limit, which is similar but applies to protons interacting with the CMB. However, for gamma-rays, the threshold is indeed around hundreds of TeV, and this effect limits the propagation of gamma-rays over cosmological distances. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 1e14 eV, or 100 TeV. However, my calculation gives 261 TeV. But maybe we can be precise here.\n\nLet me recalculate precisely:\n\n(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2\n\n= (0.511 * 1e6 eV)^2\n\n= 0.511^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2\n\n≈ 0.261 * 1e12\n\n≈ 2.61e11 (eV)^2\n\nThen, E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB\n\n= (2.61e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV)\n\n= 2.61e14 eV\n\nConvert to TeV:\n\n2.61e14 eV / 1e12 eV/TeV = 261 TeV\n\nBut sources I\'m familiar with typically cite around 100 TeV as the threshold for interaction with CMB, but this is for gamma-rays. However, maybe here the exact calculation does lead to 260 TeV.\n\nWait, a standard result is that the threshold energy for a gamma-ray photon to pair produce with a background photon of energy epsilon is E_gamma ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 epsilon). Wait, is there a factor difference here?\n\nWait. Wait, perhaps the formula is E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 epsilon_{CMB} (1 - cosθ)), assuming the collision angle θ. For head-on collision (θ=π), then 1 - cosθ = 2, so E_gamma * epsilon_{CMB} >= (m_e c^2)^2 / 2?\n\nWait, let\'s check. The calculation I saw earlier said that in the center-of-mass frame, s = 4 E1 E2 when (p1 and p2) are opposite. For pair production, s must be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, confusion arises here. Let me make this precise.\n\nThe invariant quantity s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame divided by c^4. For pair production, the threshold condition is that s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2, i.e., the total rest mass energy of the pair. The invariant s is given by:\n\ns = (E_total / c^2)^2 - (p_total)^2\n\nBut for photons moving collinearly (head-on), the momenta p1 and p2 are in opposite directions. So let\'s denote:\n\nE1 = energy of high-energy photon\n\nepsilon = energy of CMB photon\n\nThen, in the lab frame (let\'s take the frame where the CMB is isotropic except for the photon involved in the collision), but it\'s often easier to compute the invariant s.\n\nBut for two photons colliding at an angle theta, s can be written as:\n\ns = 2 E1 epsilon (1 - cos theta)\n\nTherefore, the threshold condition is 2 E1 epsilon (1 - cos theta) >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.\n\nThus:\n\nE1 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / [2 epsilon (1 - cos theta)]\n\nIf the collision is head-on (theta = 180 degrees), then cos theta = -1, thus 1 - cos theta = 2, so:\n\nE1 >= (4 m_e^2 c^4) / [2 epsilon * 2] = (4 m_e^2 c^4) / (4 epsilon) = (m_e^2 c^4) / epsilon\n\nThus, this gives E1 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon\n\nWait, so that makes:\n\nE1 = ( (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / (1e-3 eV )\n\nBut wait 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV, so substituting:\n\nE1 = (511,000 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV\n\n= 261,121,000,000 eV^2 / 0.001 eV\n\n= 261,121,000,000,000 eV\n\n= 2.61121e14 eV\n\n= 261 TeV\n\nSo that aligns with my previous calculation.\n\nEarlier, I thought that maybe the threshold is lower, but the correct calculation shows 261 TeV, right? Then, why is my notion possibly conflicting? Perhaps because sometimes when considering high-energy physics concepts, people sometimes use approximate values, but according to the precise computation here, it is indeed ~260 TeV.\n\nTherefore, yes, gamma-rays with energy above about 260 TeV would have their lifetimes limited by interactions with CMB photons via pair production.\n\nBut let me check online (if possible) to confirm.\n\nWait, since I can\'t access external resources, but if I recall correctly, the Universe becomes opaque to gamma-rays above ~10 TeV for gamma rays coming from distant sources. However, perhaps due to interactions with the extragalactic background light (EBL), which has higher energy photons (infrared, optical), leading to lower interaction energies. But the CMB is lower energy, so higher energy is needed. Wait, perhaps the EBL might produce a lower energy cutoff, while the CMB cutoff is higher. But need to think.\n\nFor example, the energy required to pair produce with CMB photons (average energy ~1e-3 eV) would be E_gamma ~ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = ~261 TeV, as calculated. For EBL photons, which have higher energies (say, ~1 eV), the cutoff is (0.511 MeV)^2 / 1 eV = ~ (511000)^2 / 1 = ~261,121,000 eV = ~260 GeV. So the EBL cutoff is around hundreds of GeV, which is why gamma-rays above ~10 TeV are from nearby sources as they can\'t travel cosmological distances due to EBL, while CMB cutoff is higher. So 261 TeV might be the CMB cutoff. Hence, our calculation (261 TeV) seems to check out here.\n\nThus, the answer would be approximately 261 TeV, but we can round it to 1e14 eV (which is 100 TeV) is commonly sometimes stated, but according to precise calculation, 260 TeV is correct.\n\nWait, maybe even specific to head-on collision here. However, since the CMB is isotropic, photons from all directions, so the cross-section is angle-averaged, but maximum cross-section occurs when collision is head-on. Therefore, the threshold here is the minimal energy; photons with higher energies can still interact with CMB photons coming from other directions. Wait, but regardless, the minimal energy that will cause a high-energy photon to interact would be when it collides head-on with a CMB photon, which requires the energy E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon_CMB). So for the most efficient reaction (probability is higher when angle is head-on?), but to determine the energy where the interaction becomes possible, it\'s when in the most favorable case (head-on), so makes sense that threshold is 261 TeV. Hence, gamma-rays above 261 TeV will start interacting with the CMB through pair production, hence their mean free path becomes limited.\n\nThus, the answer is about 260 TeV. So converting to scientific notation, that is ~2.6 x10^14 eV or 260 TeV.\n\nBut maybe the problem wants an approximate or more rounded number. Alternatively, expressed as ~10^14 eV. If 261 TeV, then 2.6x10^14 eV. But depending on whether they want exact number, so answer may be. \\boxed{261\\,\\text{TeV}}.\n\nAlternatively, we might have to consider cosmological redshift. However, the question does not specify considering redshift, but is a simplified scenario. The question says: "From what energy γ-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?"

Wait, but the formula correct here would be (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon_CMB (1 - cos theta)), and for head-on collision (theta=180 degrees), that reduces to (m_e c^2)^2 / (2 epsilon_CMB)), but in this case we found in our previous calculation when you consider the collision angle theta=pi.\n\nBut actually, when I went through the calculation with the s invariant, we had s = 4 E_gamma epsilon, which must be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2, leading to E_gamma epsilon >= (m_e c^2)^2.\n\nBut others might consider different factors.

To determine the energy at which gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by annihilation with CMB photons (γ + γ → e⁺ + e⁻), we start with the threshold energy condition for pair production. The key is ensuring the center-of-mass energy meets or exceeds the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair (2mₑc²). 

The invariant quantity \( s \) for two photons colliding with energies \( E_1 \) (gamma-ray) and \( E_2 \) (CMB photon) at an angle \( \theta \) is given by:
\[
s = 2 E_1 E_2 (1 - \cos\theta)
\]
For pair production, \( s \geq (2m_e c^2)^2 \). The most efficient collision (head-on, \( \theta = 180^\circ \)) simplifies the condition:
\[
2 E_1 E_2 (1 - (-1)) = 4 E_1 E_2 \geq (2m_e c^2)^2
\]
\[
E_1 E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2
\]
Given \( E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV} \) (average CMB photon energy) and \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 511,000 \, \text{eV} \), we calculate:
\[
E_1 \geq \frac{(511,000 \, \text{eV})^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = \frac{2.61 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2}{10^{-3} \, \text{eV}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]
Converting to tera-electron volts (TeV):
\[
2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 261 \, \text{TeV}
\]

### Final Answer
The energy threshold for gamma-rays to annihilate with CMB photons is \boxed{261\,\text{TeV}}.

However, when calculating the threshold, we want the minimum energy for the high-energy gamma-ray (E1) given that the CMB photon has energy E2 = 10^-3 eV. Wait, hold on, the problem states the average CMB photon energy is 10^-3 eV. Therefore, we need to find the minimum gamma-ray energy (E_gamma) such that when combined with the CMB photon (E_CMB = 10^-3 eV), the product E_gamma * E_CMB ≥ (m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, but c^2 is a unit conversion. So, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV. So:

E_CMB = 1e-3 eV

So,

E_gamma * 1e-3 eV ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2

But need to convert the CMB energy to the same units as m_e c^2 to compute properly.

First, let's convert 0.511 MeV to eV. 0.511 MeV = 511,000 eV. Therefore, (m_e c^2)^2 = (511,000 eV)^2 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

So the product E_gamma * E_CMB = E_gamma * 1e-3 eV ≥ 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

Hence, solving for E_gamma:

E_gamma ≥ 2.61e11 (eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV = 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.

Therefore, gamma-rays with energies above approximately 261 TeV would have their lifetimes limited by this annihilation process. That seems like a very high energy. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, but when considering the cross-section, the threshold is when gamma-rays have energy such that when colliding with CMB photons, the center-of-mass energy is enough to produce the electron-positron pair. However, in reality, because the CMB photons are low-energy, the required gamma-ray energy is indeed in the hundreds of TeV. 

This also relates to the "gamma-ray horizon," beyond which high-energy gamma-rays from distant sources are attenuated due to pair production with the CMB. So, 261 TeV might not be exactly the threshold but I need to confirm the method.

But the calculation results in 261 TeV. Let's check more exactly.

First, confirm m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV. Correct. So (m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2.

The product E1*E2 ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2.

But E2 is 1e-3 eV. First, convert the MeV to eV:

0.511 MeV = 0.511 * 1e6 eV = 511,000 eV.

So, (0.511 MeV)^2 = (511,000 eV)^2 = 511,000^2 eV^2 = 261,121,000,000 eV^2 ≈ 2.61e11 eV^2.

Thus, requiring E_gamma (eV) * 1e-3 eV ≥ 2.61e11 eV^2.

So, E_gamma ≥ (2.61e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.61e14 eV.

Convert eV to TeV: 1 TeV = 1e12 eV, so 2.61e14 eV = 261 TeV.

Therefore, the energy threshold is approximately 261 TeV.

But it's important to note that the actual threshold might depend on other factors such as the angle of collision. The above calculation assumes a head-on collision (θ = 180 degrees), which gives the minimum required energies. If the photons collide at a different angle, the required energy would be higher. But since the CMB photons are isotropic, the calculation typically uses the head-on collision as the threshold, which gives the maximum possible cross-section (if the photon is moving in the opposite direction relative to the gamma-ray), hence the most efficient case. Therefore, that's considered as the energy at which the gamma-ray's mean free path becomes significantly limited.

However, the problem states "from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So, perhaps the concept here is the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) limit, which is similar but applies to protons interacting with the CMB. However, for gamma-rays, the threshold is indeed around hundreds of TeV, and this effect limits the propagation of gamma-rays over cosmological distances. 

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 1e14 eV, or 100 TeV. However, my calculation gives 261 TeV. But maybe we can be precise here.

Let me recalculate precisely:

(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511 MeV)^2

= (0.511 * 1e6 eV)^2

= 0.511^2 * 1e12 (eV)^2

≈ 0.261 * 1e12

≈ 2.61e11 (eV)^2

Then, E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / E_CMB

= (2.61e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV)

= 2.61e14 eV

Convert to TeV:

2.61e14 eV / 1e12 eV/TeV = 261 TeV

But sources I'm familiar with typically cite around 100 TeV as the threshold for interaction with CMB, but this is for gamma-rays. However, maybe here the exact calculation does lead to 260 TeV.

Wait, a standard result is that the threshold energy for a gamma-ray photon to pair produce with a background photon of energy epsilon is E_gamma ≥ (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 epsilon). Wait, is there a factor difference here?

Wait. Wait, perhaps the formula is E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 epsilon_{CMB} (1 - cosθ)), assuming the collision angle θ. For head-on collision (θ=π), then 1 - cosθ = 2, so E_gamma * epsilon_{CMB} >= (m_e c^2)^2 / 2?

Wait, let's check. The calculation I saw earlier said that in the center-of-mass frame, s = 4 E1 E2 when (p1 and p2) are opposite. For pair production, s must be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, confusion arises here. Let me make this precise.

The invariant quantity s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame divided by c^4. For pair production, the threshold condition is that s must be at least (2 m_e c^2)^2, i.e., the total rest mass energy of the pair. The invariant s is given by:

s = (E_total / c^2)^2 - (p_total)^2

But for photons moving collinearly (head-on), the momenta p1 and p2 are in opposite directions. So let's denote:

E1 = energy of high-energy photon

epsilon = energy of CMB photon

Then, in the lab frame (let's take the frame where the CMB is isotropic except for the photon involved in the collision), but it's often easier to compute the invariant s.

But for two photons colliding at an angle theta, s can be written as:

s = 2 E1 epsilon (1 - cos theta)

Therefore, the threshold condition is 2 E1 epsilon (1 - cos theta) >= (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Thus:

E1 >= (2 m_e c^2)^2 / [2 epsilon (1 - cos theta)]

If the collision is head-on (theta = 180 degrees), then cos theta = -1, thus 1 - cos theta = 2, so:

E1 >= (4 m_e^2 c^4) / [2 epsilon * 2] = (4 m_e^2 c^4) / (4 epsilon) = (m_e^2 c^4) / epsilon

Thus, this gives E1 >= (m_e c^2)^2 / epsilon

Wait, so that makes:

E1 = ( (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / (1e-3 eV )

But wait 0.511 MeV is 511,000 eV, so substituting:

E1 = (511,000 eV)^2 / 1e-3 eV

= 261,121,000,000 eV^2 / 0.001 eV

= 261,121,000,000,000 eV

= 2.61121e14 eV

= 261 TeV

So that aligns with my previous calculation.

Earlier, I thought that maybe the threshold is lower, but the correct calculation shows 261 TeV, right? Then, why is my notion possibly conflicting? Perhaps because sometimes when considering high-energy physics concepts, people sometimes use approximate values, but according to the precise computation here, it is indeed ~260 TeV.

Therefore, yes, gamma-rays with energy above about 260 TeV would have their lifetimes limited by interactions with CMB photons via pair production.

But let me check online (if possible) to confirm.

Wait, since I can't access external resources, but if I recall correctly, the Universe becomes opaque to gamma-rays above ~10 TeV for gamma rays coming from distant sources. However, perhaps due to interactions with the extragalactic background light (EBL), which has higher energy photons (infrared, optical), leading to lower interaction energies. But the CMB is lower energy, so higher energy is needed. Wait, perhaps the EBL might produce a lower energy cutoff, while the CMB cutoff is higher. But need to think.

For example, the energy required to pair produce with CMB photons (average energy ~1e-3 eV) would be E_gamma ~ (0.511 MeV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = ~261 TeV, as calculated. For EBL photons, which have higher energies (say, ~1 eV), the cutoff is (0.511 MeV)^2 / 1 eV = ~ (511000)^2 / 1 = ~261,121,000 eV = ~260 GeV. So the EBL cutoff is around hundreds of GeV, which is why gamma-rays above ~10 TeV are from nearby sources as they can't travel cosmological distances due to EBL, while CMB cutoff is higher. So 261 TeV might be the CMB cutoff. Hence, our calculation (261 TeV) seems to check out here.

Thus, the answer would be approximately 261 TeV, but we can round it to 1e14 eV (which is 100 TeV) is commonly sometimes stated, but according to precise calculation, 260 TeV is correct.

Wait, maybe even specific to head-on collision here. However, since the CMB is isotropic, photons from all directions, so the cross-section is angle-averaged, but maximum cross-section occurs when collision is head-on. Therefore, the threshold here is the minimal energy; photons with higher energies can still interact with CMB photons coming from other directions. Wait, but regardless, the minimal energy that will cause a high-energy photon to interact would be when it collides head-on with a CMB photon, which requires the energy E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon_CMB). So for the most efficient reaction (probability is higher when angle is head-on?), but to determine the energy where the interaction becomes possible, it's when in the most favorable case (head-on), so makes sense that threshold is 261 TeV. Hence, gamma-rays above 261 TeV will start interacting with the CMB through pair production, hence their mean free path becomes limited.

Thus, the answer is about 260 TeV. So converting to scientific notation, that is ~2.6 x10^14 eV or 260 TeV.

But maybe the problem wants an approximate or more rounded number. Alternatively, expressed as ~10^14 eV. If 261 TeV, then 2.6x10^14 eV. But depending on whether they want exact number, so answer may be. \boxed{261\,\text{TeV}}.

Alternatively, we might have to consider cosmological redshift. However, the question does not specify considering redshift, but is a simplified scenario. The question says: "From what energy γ-rays would have their lifetimes in the universe limited by this process?" So, probably taking into account the average CMB photon energy, assume that any gamma-ray photon with energy above the threshold would interact within a certain time. So, the answer is 261 TeV.

Alternatively, if I recall that the exact threshold energy is sometimes given by E_gamma = (m_e c^2)^2 / (4 epsilon_CMB)(1 + z)^2, where z is the redshift, but if we are talking about present-day universe (z=0), and assuming head-on collision, then in the previous calculation we saw. Wait, but the formula correct here would be (m_e c^2)^2 / (epsilon_CMB (1 - cos theta)), and for head-on collision (theta=180 degrees), that reduces to (m_e c^2)^2 / (2 epsilon_CMB)), but in this case we found in our previous calculation when you consider the collision angle theta=pi.

But actually, when I went through the calculation with the s invariant, we had s = 4 E_gamma epsilon, which must be >= (2 m_e c^2)^2, leading to E_gamma epsilon >= (m_e c^2)^2.

But others might consider different factors. Wait, let's redo the invariant s calculation. For two photons, 4-momenta p1 and p2, then:

s = (p1 + p2)^2 = [E1 + E2, p1 c + p2 c]^2

But photons are massless, so p1 c = E1 \(\hat{n}_1\) and p2 c = E2 \(\hat{n}_2\). Then, the invariant s would be:

s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 \hat{n}_1 + E2 \hat{n}_2)^2 c^2

= (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1^2 + E2^2 + 2 E1 E2 \hat{n}_1 \cdot \hat{n}_2) )

= 2 E1 E2(1 - \cosθ)

where θ is the angle between the two photons' directions. At threshold, s = (2 m_e c^2)^2.

Thus, 2 E1 E2 (1 - cosθ) = (2 m_e c^2)^2

=> E1 E2 = 2 (m_e c^2)^2 / (1 - cosθ)

For head-on collision (θ = 180 degrees), cosθ = -1, so 1 - cosθ = 2:

E1 E2 = 2 (m_e c^2)^2 / 2 = (m_e c^2)^2.

Therefore:

E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2

Thus,

E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2

Therefore, plugging values, (511 keV)^2 / (0.001 eV) = (511,000 eV)^2 / (0.001 eV) = 511,000^2 / 0.001 [eV]

Solve that:

511,000^2 = 261,121,000,000

Divide by 0.001:

261,121,000,000 / 0.001 = 261,121,000,000,000 eV = 261.121 TeV

Therefore, approximately 261 TeV.

Hence, the conclusion is that gamma-rays with energy above approximately 261 TeV would effectively interact with CMB photons via pair production, thereby limiting their mean free path in the Universe. 

Therefore, the answer is about 261 TeV. I think enough box.
