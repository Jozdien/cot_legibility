Given a spin-half particle in the state \(| \psi \rangle = 0.5 | \uparrow \rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} | \downarrow \rangle\), we need to find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\).

1. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_z\)**:
   - The eigenvalues of \(\sigma_z\) for \(| \uparrow \rangle\) and \(| \downarrow \rangle\) are \(+1\) and \(-1\) respectively.
   - The probabilities are \(|0.5|^2 = 0.25\) for \(| \uparrow \rangle\) and \(\left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75\) for \(| \downarrow \rangle\).
   - The expectation value \(\langle \sigma_z \rangle\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot 1 + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
     \]
   - Therefore, \(10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5\).

2. **Expectation value of \(\sigma_x\)**:
   - The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_x\) is given by:
     \[
     \sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Applying \(\sigma_x\) to \(| \psi \rangle\) and taking the inner product with \(\langle \psi |\):
     \[
     \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
     \]
   - Therefore, \(5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 4.33\).

3. **Total expectation value**:
   - Summing the contributions from \(\sigma_z\) and \(\sigma_x\):
     \[
     10 \langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5 \langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
     \]
   - Rounded to one decimal place, the result is \(-0.7\).

The expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a spin-half particle in a superposition state: 0.5 times the spin-up state plus sqrt(3)/2 times the spin-down state. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, right. Expectation value... that's like the average value you'd measure if you measured the operator many times on this state, right?

First, I need to recall how to compute the expectation value of an operator in quantum mechanics. I think the formula is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ where A is the operator. So, in this case, A is 10σz + 5σx. Since expectation value is linear, I can compute 10 times the expectation of σz plus 5 times the expectation of σx. That should make things simpler, right? So break it down into two parts.

Let me start by writing down the given state vector clearly. The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me verify that this is normalized. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. Let's check: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Okay, good. So it's a valid quantum state.

Now, first part is the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, the expectation value of σz in this state should be the probability of measuring spin-up multiplied by 1 plus the probability of measuring spin-down multiplied by -1. Let's compute that.

Probability of spin-up is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and spin-down is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Therefore, 10 times that is 10*(-0.5) = -5. So that's the first term.

Next, the expectation value of σx. This might be a bit trickier since σx doesn't diagonalize in the same basis as σz. The Pauli matrix σx is given by:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

So, to find ⟨σx⟩, we need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me write out the state as a vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1], then |ψ⟩ is 0.5*[1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2)*[0; 1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So, the bra vector ⟨ψ| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. Let me multiply this with σx and then with |ψ⟩.

First, let's compute σx |ψ⟩. Applying the matrix σx to the vector |ψ⟩:

[0, 1] [0.5]   [sqrt(3)/2]
[1, 0] [sqrt(3)/2] = [0.5]

So σx |ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then, taking the inner product with ⟨ψ|:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] • [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = (0.5*sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2*0.5)

Simplifying that: both terms are (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Is that right? So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, 5 times that is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5*0.866 ≈ 4.33.

So putting it all together, the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7. Wait, but let me check. Might have messed up some calculations.

But let me verify the calculation for ⟨σx⟩ again. Using the components.

Given |ψ⟩ = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], ⟨ψ|σx is σx applied to |ψ⟩ and then conjugated. Wait, perhaps it's better to just follow the standard procedure. But maybe using matrix multiplication is the surest way.

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩: 

Multiply [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0, 1],[1, 0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

First, compute σx|ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], as before. Then inner product with ⟨ψ| gives 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. Which is the same as 2*(0.5*sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3)/2. So that's correct. So 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is 5*0.8660... ≈ 4.330, yes.

So total expectation value is -5 + 4.330 ≈ -0.670, which to one decimal place is -0.7. But let me check if it's supposed to be rounded to the tenths place. So -0.67 rounds to -0.7. However, noting that 0.67 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6, but since we're taking one decimal place, the original number is -0.67, so it's -0.7. Ok.

Alternatively, we can compute exactly. Let's see:

Given the state |ψ⟩ = (1/2)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

Then:

⟨σz⟩ = (1/2)^2*(1) + (√3/2)^2*(-1) = (1/4)(1) + (3/4)(-1) = 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/2.

⟨σx⟩ = 2 * (1/2) * (√3/2) * 1 = (√3)/2. Because σx has off-diagonal elements 1, so ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = 1 and ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ =1. Therefore, the cross terms. Wait, alternatively ⟨σx⟩ can be calculated as:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (⟨↑|*(1/2) + ⟨↓|*(√3/2)) σx ( |↑⟩*(1/2) + |↓⟩*(√3/2) )

= (1/2)(√3/2)⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + (√3/2)(1/2)⟨↓|σx|↑⟩

Since σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = 1 and ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ =1.

Therefore, ⟨σx⟩ = (1/2)(√3/2)*1 + (√3/2)(1/2)*1 = √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2.

So √3/2 ≈1.732/2≈0.866. So that's accurate. Therefore, the expectation of 10σz +5σx is 10*(-1/2) +5*(√3/2)= -5 + (5√3)/2 ≈ -5 + (5*1.732)/2 ≈ -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67.

Hence, the expectation value is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, but I need to confirm if the question is asking for the answer to one decimal place. The problem says, "expectation value up to one decimal place," so yes, -0.7.

Just to recap, step by step without thinking:

Given the state |ψ> = a|↑> + b|↓> with |a|² + |b|² =1.

Compute <σz> = |a|² - |b|² = (0.25) - (0.75) = -0.5. Then 10<-0.5> = -5.

Compute <σx> = ab* + a*b. Since a =0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2. So ab* is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) (since a and b are real here, this is just 0.5*sqrt(3)/2), and similarly a*b is the same. So total is 2*(0.5*sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3)/2. Thus, 5*<σx> =5*(sqrt(3)/2)≈4.33.

Adding these gives -5 +4.33≈-0.67≈-0.7 to one decimal place.

Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-0.7}

**Final Answer**
The expectation value is \boxed{-0.7}.

I'm going to analyze this quantum mechanics problem step by step. We have a spin-half particle in a superposition state, represented as 0.5 times the spin-up state plus sqrt(3)/2 times the spin-down state. Our task is to calculate the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The expectation value represents the average result we would get if we repeatedly measured this operator on identically prepared systems.

To compute an expectation value in quantum mechanics, I need to use the formula ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, where A is our operator. Since expectation values are linear, I can separate this into 10 times the expectation value of σz plus 5 times the expectation value of σx, which simplifies the calculation.

Let me clearly define our state: |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. I should first verify this is properly normalized by checking if the squared coefficients sum to 1: (0.5)² + (sqrt(3)/2)² = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. This confirms it's a valid quantum state.

For the first part, I need to find the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, the expectation value will be the probability of measuring spin-up multiplied by 1, plus the probability of measuring

Alright, let me attempt to solve this problem. We have a spin-half particle in a superposition state given by 0.5 times the spin-up state plus the square root of 3 divided by 2 times the spin-down state. Our goal is to determine the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, the expectation value refers to the average outcome we'd observe if we measured the operator repeatedly on this state, correct?

To compute the expectation value of an operator in quantum mechanics, I must use the formula ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, where A is the operator. In this scenario, A corresponds to 10σz + 5σx. Since the expectation value is a linear operation, I can calculate it by taking 10 times the expectation of σz and adding 5 times the expectation of σx. This approach simplifies the process. So, let's deconstruct it into two components.

First, I'll express the given state vector clearly. The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. I should verify the state is normalized by ensuring the sum of the squared coefficients equals 1. Let's see: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Great, it's a valid quantum state.

Starting with the expectation value of σz, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues of +1 and -1 respectively, the expectation value of σz in this state involves calculating the probability of measuring spin-up multiplied by 1, plus the probability of measuring...

Hmm, that seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the expectation value of σx. Now, σx is the Pauli x-operator. I remember that σx flips the spin, right? So, if we write σx in matrix form, it\'s [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. The eigenstates of σx are |→⟩ and |←⟩ (right and left), which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But here, we need the expectation value in the given state |ψ⟩. Maybe the easiest way is to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ directly.\n\nAlternatively, using matrix representation. Let\'s represent |↑⟩ as a column vector [1; 0] and |↓⟩ as [0; 1]. Then our state |ψ⟩ is 0.5*[1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2)*[0; 1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. The conjugate transpose would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].\n\nNow, σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Let\'s compute σx |ψ⟩. Multiply the matrix by the vector:\n\nσx |ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.\n\nCalculating this: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3)/4), and the same term again, so total is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2. Let\'s compute that numerically.\n\nFirst, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 5*sqrt(3) ≈ 5*1.732 ≈ 8.66. Then divide by 2: 8.66/2 = 4.33. So the total expectation value is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67. Hmm. Rounded to one decimal place, that\'s -0.7. But wait, let\'s check that exact calculation again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me do it more accurately.\n\nThe exact value is 10*(-1/2) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2. Calculating (5 sqrt(3))/2: sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205, so 1.73205*5 = 8.66025, divided by 2 is 4.330125. Then -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875. So approximately -0.6699. Rounded to one decimal place is -0.7. But I need to check whether it\'s -0.7 or is there a chance of rounding up.\n\nWait, since the next digit is 6, which is more than 5, so yes, when rounding to one decimal place, the 6 in the second decimal place rounds the first decimal up. So yes, -0.7. But wait, hold on. The exact value is -0.669875, which is approximately -0.67, so to one decimal place, since 6 is the first decimal and the next is 6, which would round it up. Wait, wait, -0.669875 is -0.6 (decimal) 69875. The first decimal is 6, the second is 6. Hmm, how does decimal rounding work here?\n\nWait, in usual rounding rules, 0.66 would be 0.7 to one decimal? Wait, no. Wait, 0.66 to one decimal is 0.7. But actually, it\'s 0.6 (tenths place) and 6 (hundredths place). So since the hundredths place is 6 >=5, we round the tenths place up from 6 to 7. Therefore, 0.66 rounds to 0.7 when rounding to one decimal place. Therefore, -0.66... would round to -0.7. However, some people might say that 0.66 is 0.7, but depending on the convention. But in most cases, 0.66 to one decimal is 0.7. Let me verify with a calculator.\n\nNo, wait, so if I have 0.66 and round to one decimal, which is the first decimal place (6) and the next digit is 6, so it\'s 0.7. Similarly, -0.66 becomes -0.7.\n\nBut let me also check where exactly the cutoff is. 0.65 is the midpoint, so 0.65 would round up to 0.7. So 0.66 is higher than 0.65, so it\'s definitely 0.7. So yeah, the answer is -0.7.\n\nBut let me see again, the expectation value is -5 + (5√3)/2. Maybe there\'s a different way to present the answer. Let\'s compute that exact expression again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact value is required? Wait, the problem says "up to one decimal place," so they probably want a numerical value. So, even if it\'s approximately -0.67, which is approximately -0.7. So answer is \\boxed{-0.7}\n\nWait a moment. Wait, but let me check the calculation again to be sure. Let\'s redo the steps in case I made an error.\n\nGiven |ψ> = 0.5|↑> + (√3)/2 |↓>\n\nSo, expressed as a vector: [0.5; (√3)/2]\n\nExpectation value of σz: as above, since σz is diagonal with entries 1 and -1. So the calculation is |0.5|^2*1 + |(√3)/2|^2*(-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct.\n\nThen σx\'s expectation value is [0.5, (√3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; (√3)/2]. The product of σx and |ψ> is [(√3)/2; 0.5], and then the inner product with <ψ| is 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5 = same as 0.5*(√3)/2 * 2 = 0.5*√3, right? Wait, 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5 is two times 0.5*(√3)/2, which is (0.5*√3)/2 + (0.5*√3)/2 = (0.5*√3). So sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. That\'s correct. So ⟨σx⟩= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.\n\nTherefore, 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩=10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2)= -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2. As above, calculating (5*1.732)/2=8.66/2=4.33; -5+4.33= -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.\n\nBut the question says "up to one decimal place." So -0.7 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the exact value?\n\nBut since the answer requires one decimal place, the rounded value is -0.7. Hence, \\boxed{-0.7}\n\nBut let me check once more.\n\nAlternative way: maybe using the Bloch sphere representation. The given state is a superposition, so the expectation values of σz and σx can be found from the components.\n\nFor a spin-1/2 particle, the expectation values of the Pauli matrices correspond to the coordinates on the Bloch sphere. So, if the state is |ψ> = a|↑> + b|↓>, then ⟨σz⟩ = |a|^2 - |b|^2, ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re(a b*), and ⟨σy⟩ = 2 Im(a b*).\n\nWait, let me recall. The Bloch vector components are (⟨σx⟩, ⟨σy⟩, ⟨σz⟩). So for our case, a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.\n\nTherefore, ⟨σz⟩= |a|^2 - |b|^2 = (0.25) - (0.75) = -0.5 as before. Good.\n\n⟨σx⟩= 2 Re(a b*). Since a and b are real numbers here, Re(a b*) is just a*b. So 2*a*b=2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2)=2*(0.5* sqrt(3)/2)=2*(sqrt(3)/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866. Which matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, again, the same numbers, so expectation value is -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So I think this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if one is worried, maybe compute 5*sqrt(3) first? sqrt(3)≈1.73205, so 5√3≈8.66025, divided by 2 is 4.330125. Then subtract 5: -5 +4.330125≈-0.669875. So it\'s approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 to one decimal place. Yep.\n\nThus, the answer is -0.7. So I think that\'s correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-0.7}\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744973260, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2876, prompt_tokens=462, total_tokens=3338, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

Given a spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), we need to find the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \).

1. **Normalization Check**:
   The state is normalized since \( (0.5)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1 \).

2. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_z\)**:
   - Eigenvalues of \(\sigma_z\) are \(+1\) for \(|\uparrow\rangle\) and \(-1\) for \(|\downarrow\rangle\).
   - Probabilities: \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \) for spin-up and \( \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75 \) for spin-down.
   - Calculation: \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot 1 + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = -0.5 \).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

auring spin-down multiplied by -1. The probabilities are the squares of the coefficients: (0.5)^2 = 0.25 and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.75. So, expectation value ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Hmm, that seems straightforward.

Next, the expectation value of σx. Now, σx is the Pauli x-operator. I remember that σx flips the spin, right? So, if we write σx in matrix form, it's [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. The eigenstates of σx are |→⟩ and |←⟩ (right and left), which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But here, we need the expectation value in the given state |ψ⟩. Maybe the easiest way is to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ directly.

Alternatively, using matrix representation. Let's represent |↑⟩ as a column vector [1; 0] and |↓⟩ as [0; 1]. Then our state |ψ⟩ is 0.5*[1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2)*[0; 1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. The conjugate transpose would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Now, σx is [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. Let's compute σx |ψ⟩. Multiply the matrix by the vector:

σx |ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then take the inner product with ⟨ψ|, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5] = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Calculating this: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (sqrt(3)/4), and the same term again, so total is sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Therefore, the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2. Let's compute that numerically.

First, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 5*sqrt(3) ≈ 5*1.732 ≈ 8.66. Then divide by 2: 8.66/2 = 4.33. So the total expectation value is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67. Hmm. Rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. But wait, let's check that exact calculation again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me do it more accurately.

The exact value is 10*(-1/2) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2. Calculating (5 sqrt(3))/2: sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205, so 1.73205*5 = 8.66025, divided by 2 is 4.330125. Then -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875. So approximately -0.6699. Rounded to one decimal place is -0.7. But I need to check whether it's -0.7 or is there a chance of rounding up.

Wait, since the next digit is 6, which is more than 5, so yes, when rounding to one decimal place, the 6 in the second decimal place rounds the first decimal up. So yes, -0.7. But wait, hold on. The exact value is -0.669875, which is approximately -0.67, so to one decimal place, since 6 is the first decimal and the next is 6, which would round it up. Wait, wait, -0.669875 is -0.6 (decimal) 69875. The first decimal is 6, the second is 6. Hmm, how does decimal rounding work here?

Wait, in usual rounding rules, 0.66 would be 0.7 to one decimal? Wait, no. Wait, 0.66 to one decimal is 0.7. But actually, it's 0.6 (tenths place) and 6 (hundredths place). So since the hundredths place is 6 >=5, we round the tenths place up from 6 to 7. Therefore, 0.66 rounds to 0.7 when rounding to one decimal place. Therefore, -0.66... would round to -0.7. However, some people might say that 0.66 is 0.7, but depending on the convention. But in most cases, 0.66 to one decimal is 0.7. Let me verify with a calculator.

No, wait, so if I have 0.66 and round to one decimal, which is the first decimal place (6) and the next digit is 6, so it's 0.7. Similarly, -0.66 becomes -0.7.

But let me also check where exactly the cutoff is. 0.65 is the midpoint, so 0.65 would round up to 0.7. So 0.66 is higher than 0.65, so it's definitely 0.7. So yeah, the answer is -0.7.

But let me see again, the expectation value is -5 + (5√3)/2. Maybe there's a different way to present the answer. Let's compute that exact expression again.

Alternatively, maybe the exact value is required? Wait, the problem says "up to one decimal place," so they probably want a numerical value. So, even if it's approximately -0.67, which is approximately -0.7. So answer is \boxed{-0.7}

Wait a moment. Wait, but let me check the calculation again to be sure. Let's redo the steps in case I made an error.

Given |ψ> = 0.5|↑> + (√3)/2 |↓>

So, expressed as a vector: [0.5; (√3)/2]

Expectation value of σz: as above, since σz is diagonal with entries 1 and -1. So the calculation is |0.5|^2*1 + |(√3)/2|^2*(-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct.

Then σx's expectation value is [0.5, (√3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; (√3)/2]. The product of σx and |ψ> is [(√3)/2; 0.5], and then the inner product with <ψ| is 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5 = same as 0.5*(√3)/2 * 2 = 0.5*√3, right? Wait, 0.5*(√3)/2 + (√3)/2*0.5 is two times 0.5*(√3)/2, which is (0.5*√3)/2 + (0.5*√3)/2 = (0.5*√3). So sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. That's correct. So ⟨σx⟩= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Therefore, 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩=10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2)= -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2. As above, calculating (5*1.732)/2=8.66/2=4.33; -5+4.33= -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.

But the question says "up to one decimal place." So -0.7 is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the exact value?

But since the answer requires one decimal place, the rounded value is -0.7. Hence, \boxed{-0.7}

But let me check once more.

Alternative way: maybe using the Bloch sphere representation. The given state is a superposition, so the expectation values of σz and σx can be found from the components.

For a spin-1/2 particle, the expectation values of the Pauli matrices correspond to the coordinates on the Bloch sphere. So, if the state is |ψ> = a|↑> + b|↓>, then ⟨σz⟩ = |a|^2 - |b|^2, ⟨σx⟩ = 2 Re(a b*), and ⟨σy⟩ = 2 Im(a b*).

Wait, let me recall. The Bloch vector components are (⟨σx⟩, ⟨σy⟩, ⟨σz⟩). So for our case, a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, ⟨σz⟩= |a|^2 - |b|^2 = (0.25) - (0.75) = -0.5 as before. Good.

⟨σx⟩= 2 Re(a b*). Since a and b are real numbers here, Re(a b*) is just a*b. So 2*a*b=2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2)=2*(0.5* sqrt(3)/2)=2*(sqrt(3)/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866. Which matches the previous result.

Therefore, again, the same numbers, so expectation value is -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So I think this is correct.

Alternatively, if one is worried, maybe compute 5*sqrt(3) first? sqrt(3)≈1.73205, so 5√3≈8.66025, divided by 2 is 4.330125. Then subtract 5: -5 +4.330125≈-0.669875. So it's approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 to one decimal place. Yep.

Thus, the answer is -0.7. So I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-0.7}

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

The spin-half particle is in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). We need to find the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \).

1. **Normalization Check**:
   The coefficients are \( 0.5 \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Squaring these gives \( 0.25 \) and \( 0.75 \), which sum to 1, confirming the state is normalized.

2. **Expectation Value of \( \sigma_z \)**:
   - Eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are +1 and -1.
   - Probabilities: \( (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \).
   - Calculation: \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot 1 + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = -0.5 \).

3. **Expectation Value of \( \sigma_x \)**:
   - The Pauli-X matrix \( \sigma_x \) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\).
   - Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( |\psi\rangle \) gives \(\begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{pmatrix}\).
   - Inner product calculation: \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \).

4. **Combining Results**:
   - Expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \):
   \[
   10 \cdot (-0.5) + 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = -5 + \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]
   - Numerical approximation: \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \)
   \[
   \frac{5 \cdot 1.732}{2} \approx 4.33 \implies -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
   \]
   - Rounded to one decimal place: \( -0.7 \).

The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

spin-down multiplied by -1. The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients: (0.5)^2 = 0.25 for |↑⟩ and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.75 for |↓⟩. Therefore, ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Next, we need ⟨σx⟩. σx is the Pauli-X operator, which swaps the spin-up and spin-down states, introducing a bit more complexity because it's not diagonal in the σz basis. The standard matrix representation of σx in the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ basis is:
[[0, 1],
 [1, 0]]
 
To compute the expectation value, we can either calculate ψ† σx ψ or recognize that σx acts as a ladder operator. Alternatively, since the state is written in the σz basis, let's compute it explicitly. 

Writing the state |ψ⟩ as a vector: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Multiplying σx by this vector gives [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T. Then the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the dot product of [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] and [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Calculating this: (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Therefore, ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩ = 10*(-0.5) + 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ -5 + 5*(0.866) ≈ -5 + 4.33 ≈ -0.67. Rounded to one decimal place, this would be -0.7. 

Wait a minute, hold on. Let me check again with exact values before approximating to avoid rounding errors. The exact value is: -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2. Since sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so (5*1.732)/2 ≈ 4.33. Thus, the total is indeed approximately -0.67. However, when rounding to one decimal place, -0.67 rounds to -0.7 due to the next digit being 7 which is greater than 5. But let me confirm once more if there were any computational mistakes.

Alternatively, breaking down the exact calculation step by step:

First, σz expectation: (0.5)^2 * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2*(-1) = 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = -0.5. Correct as before.

Then, σx expectation: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + 0.5*sqrt(3)/2 = (0.5*1.732)/2 + (0.5*1.732)/2 = approx 0.433 + 0.433 = 0.866. Therefore, 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33. Then 10*(-0.5) + 4.33 is -5 + 4.33 = -0.67. Rounded to one decimal is -0.7. So the answer should be -0.7.

But maybe we need to compute the exact fraction first before rounding. Let me try that. The exact value is 10*(-1/2) + 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2. Since sqrt(3) is about 1.73205, then 5*1.73205 is approximately 8.66025, divided by 2 is 4.330125. Then, -5 + 4.330125 = -0.669875. Another decimal digit: approximately -0.6699, so to one decimal place, it's -0.7. That's correct.

Alternatively, if for some reason the user required a specific decimal treatment, but no, given the way it's phrased, up to one decimal place. So, the answer is -0.7.

But wait, wait another moment! I need to make sure that I computed the expectation value for sigma x correctly. Let's matrix-multiply σx by the state and then take the inner product.

The vector |ψ> is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Applying σ_x:

σx|ψ> = [0*(0.5) + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*(0.5) + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)]^T = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

The conjugate transpose for ⟨ψ| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], since the coefficients are real numbers. So ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = [0.5*sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 *0.5] = same term twice.

Indeed, 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/4, and twice that is sqrt(3)/2, which matches.

Thus, the computations check out. Therefore, the expectation value of 10σ_z + 5σ_x is -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2. Numerically, as we saw, this is approximately -0.67, or -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Hence, the final answer is \boxed{-0.7}.

**Final Answer**
The expectation value is \boxed{-0.7}.

To find the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) for a spin-half particle in the state \(0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization Check**: Verify the state is normalized:
   \[
   (0.5)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1
   \]
   The state is normalized.

2. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_z\)**:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot 1 + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
   \]
   Therefore, \(10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5\).

3. **Expectation Value of \(\sigma_x\)**:
   The state vector in column form is \(\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}\). Applying \(\sigma_x\) to this state:
   \[
   \sigma_x \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
   \]
   The expectation value is:
   \[
   \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, \(5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5 \cdot 0.866 = 4.33\).

4. **Total Expectation Value**:
   \[
   10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 \approx -0.67
   \]
   Rounded to one decimal place, this is \(-0.7\).

Thus, the expectation value of the operator \(10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x\) is \(\boxed{-0.7}\).

wait, no, maybe even more straightforward: The expectation value is the sum over the products of the coefficients squared times their corresponding eigenvalues. Thus, for σz, we can write it as:

⟨σz⟩ = |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1) = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5

So the expectation of σz is -0.5.

Therefore, 10 times that would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, moving on to σx. The calculation here is a bit trickier because the given state is not expressed in the eigenbasis of σx. The σx operator has eigenstates that are not the same as σz's. Recall that the Pauli matrix σx is:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

In terms of the basis states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, σx converts spin-up to spin-down and vice versa. Alternatively, its eigenstates are |→⟩ and |←⟩, which correspond to spin-right and spin-left in the x-direction. These can be written as superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

But since we are asked for the expectation value of σx in the given state |ψ⟩, we can compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ directly.

So let's proceed. Let me write out the state as a column vector. Conventionally, |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. Therefore, our state |ψ⟩ is:

0.5 * [1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2) * [0; 1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

Hence, the bra vector ⟨ψ| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

Applying σx to |ψ⟩ gives:

σx |ψ⟩ = [[0, 1], [1, 0]] [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]

Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5], which is:

0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2

Alternatively, we can compute this by expanding the inner product:

⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5*sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2

Converting sqrt(3)/2 to decimal gives approximately 0.8660, since sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732.

Therefore, the expectation value of σx is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Then, 5 times that is 5*0.866 ≈ 4.330.

Adding both contributions from 10σz and 5σx:

10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩ = (-5) + 4.330 ≈ -0.670.

Rounded to one decimal place, this would be approximately -0.7.

But let me double-check the arithmetic. If for the precise value: sqrt(3)/2 is exact. So the exact value is 10*(-0.5) + 5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*sqrt(3))/2.

Calculating 5*sqrt(3) ≈ 5*1.732 ≈ 8.66, divided by 2 gives 4.33. Thus, -5 +4.33 is -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Alright, the answer should be -0.7.

But just to make sure I didn't mess up any step. Let me recap:

1. Check normalization. Confirmed it's correct.
2. Calculated ⟨σz⟩: (0.5)^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 *(-1)= 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. Correct.

For ⟨σx⟩, another approach: Express |ψ⟩ as a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. σx is the matrix that swaps the components. Apply σx to |ψ⟩, gives [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]. Then the inner product is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5. Both terms are combined to (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4)= sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, correct. Then multiplied by 5 gives ~4.33. Then 10σz term is 10*(-0.5)= -5, so total is -5+4.33= -0.67, which is -0.7 when rounded. Perfect.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the general result for spin-1/2 particles. The expectation value for an operator in a general direction can be calculated using the expectation values based on the orientation.

Alternatively, we can parameterize the state as a spinor pointing along some direction. The state given is a superposition of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Let's note that a general spin state can be written as:

|ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2) |↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓⟩

In this problem, our state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩, which matches with cos(θ/2) = 0.5 and sin(θ/2)= sqrt(3)/2. Since the coefficients are real, the phase φ is 0. Therefore, cos(θ/2)=0.5 implies θ/2=60 degrees (since cos(60°)=0.5), so θ=120 degrees. Alternatively, θ=2π/3 radians.

Therefore, the spin is pointing at an angle θ=120° from the positive z-axis. So, if we wish to compute the expectation values of σz and σx, how?

The expectation value of σj in a state with polar angle θ and azimuthal angle φ (which is 0 here) is given by:

⟨σz⟩ = cosθ, and ⟨σx⟩ = sinθ cosφ, ⟨σy⟩ = sinθ sinφ

In our case, φ=0, θ=120°, so:

⟨σz⟩ = cos(120°) = cos(2π/3) = -0.5, which is what we found earlier.

⟨σx⟩ = sin(120°) cos(0) = (sqrt(3)/2)(1) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866

So, using this method, we also arrive at the same result, so this cross-verifies our previous computations. Then, again, 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5*sqrt(3)/2) ≈ -5 +4.330 ≈ -0.67, so -0.7 to one decimal.

Therefore, I can be confident that the expectation value is approximately -0.7.

**Final Answer**
The expectation value is \boxed{-0.7}.
