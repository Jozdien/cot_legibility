To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex solution at pH ideal (where EDTA is fully deprotonated as Y⁴⁻) and stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \):

1. **Reaction and Stability Constant**:
   \[
   \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \quad K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
   \]

2. **Assumptions**:
   - The solution is stoichiometric, meaning all Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ initially form the complex. Thus, \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \) with negligible dissociation (\( x \ll 0.02 \)).
   - At equilibrium, \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \).

3. **Substitute into Stability Expression**:
   \[
   K = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \implies x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13} \implies x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
   \]

**Final Answer**: The concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}} \).

Okay, let's try to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in this solution. The problem says we have a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is ideal. The stability constant (K) for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, I need to find [Ca²⁺]. Let's recall what I know about EDTA complexes.

EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms stable complexes with metal ions. The stability constant K indicates how strong the complex is. A high K value like 5e10 means the complex is very stable, so most of the Ca²⁺ should be tied up in the EDTA complex. But since we're given that it's a stoichiometric solution, maybe all the Ca²⁺ and EDTA are in the complex form initially? But wait, the question is about the free calcium ion concentration. Even though the complex is stable, there should be some tiny amount of Ca²⁺ dissociated.

The reaction is: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻. The stability constant K is given by [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]). Since it's a 1:1 complex, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ should be equal if nothing else is present. Wait, but the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. That probably means that the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA are equimolar in the complex. So initially, all the EDTA and Ca²⁺ are in the complex form. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Therefore, when it dissociates, it will produce some x amount of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻.

So we can write the expression:

K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 5e10

But since the complex dissociates slightly into Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻, let's let x be the concentration of [Ca²⁺] (which is equal to [EDTA⁴⁻] because of the 1:1 stoichiometry). The concentration of the complex will then be 0.02 - x. But since K is very large, x is going to be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Therefore, we can approximate that [Ca-EDTA²⁻] ≈ 0.02 M.

Plugging into the equation:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

Then solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13

Take the square root of that:

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 Hmm, wait. Square root of 4e-13 is 2 * (1e-13)^0.5 = 2 * 1e-6.5. But 1e-6.5 is 10^(-6.5) which is approximately 3.16e-7. So x ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Wait, but let me calculate that more precisely.

Wait, maybe I can write 4e-13. Let's take square root. sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2*(1e-13)^0.5. Now, 1e-13 is 10^-13, so square root is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5. 10^-6 is 1e-6, and 10^-0.5 is about 0.316. So 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so multiplied by 2 is 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me verify. The K expression is for the formation of the complex, which is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). Because EDTA is in solution as a ligand, but because the solution is at ideal pH, I think all EDTA is in the form that can complex with Ca²+—probably the Y⁴- form. The problem states that the pH is ideal, which for EDTA typically means pH where EDTA is fully deprotonated, so Y⁴- is the dominant species. Therefore, we don't have to worry about protonation states complicating the EDTA concentration.

So the approximation that [EDTA] = x is valid. Therefore, yes, our initial calculation holds. Since the stability constant is very large, the amount of dissociation (x) is minimal. Hence, the concentration of Ca²+ is sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) which is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

But let's compute the exact value. 4e-13 under square root. 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. sqrt(4) = 2, sqrt(10^-13) = 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5. 10^-6.5 is the same as 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 1e-6 * 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-7. Therefore, 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.3245e-7. So approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Let me check the calculation once again.

Given K = 5e10.

After dissociation:

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA⁴⁻] = x

[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02

So K = 0.02 / (x^2) => x^2 = 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.02 / 5 / 1e10 = 0.004 / 1e10 = 4e-3 / 1e10 = 4e-13. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, x = 2e-6.5, which as computed is ~6.32e-7. So the answer should be 6.3e-7 M. Alternatively, in scientific notation, 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

Is this correct? Alternatively, maybe I missed a step here. Let me double-check.

Let's attempt to determine the calcium ion concentration in this solution. According to the problem, we have a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex at an ideal pH. The stability constant (K) for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. I need to calculate [Ca²⁺] using my knowledge of EDTA complexes.

EDTA functions as a chelating agent that forms stable complexes with metal ions. The stability constant K measures the complex's strength. With such a high K value of 5e10, the complex is extremely stable, meaning most calcium ions should be bound to EDTA. Since it's described as a stoichiometric solution, it seems all the Ca²⁺ and EDTA are initially complexed. However, the question asks about free calcium ion concentration, suggesting some small amount of Ca²⁺ must be dissociated from the complex.

For the reaction Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻, the stability constant K equals [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]). In a 1:1 complex, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ should be equal if nothing else is pre

Alright, let's try to determine the concentration of calcium ions in this solution. The problem states we have a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is optimal. The stability constant (K) for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. I need to calculate [Ca²⁺]. Let’s review what I know about EDTA complexes.

EDTA is a chelating agent that forms stable complexes with metal ions. The stability constant K shows the strength of the complex. A high K value like 5e10 means the complex is highly stable, so most of the Ca²⁺ should be bound in the EDTA complex. Given that it's a stoichiometric solution, maybe all the Ca²⁺ and EDTA are initially in the complex form? However, the question is concerned with the free calcium ion concentration. Despite the complex's stability, there should be a minute amount of Ca²⁺ that is dissociated.

The reaction is: Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻. The stability constant K is expressed as [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]). Since it's a 1:1 complex, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ should be equal if nothing else is present.

Wait, but the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Does that mean that initially, all the EDTA is bound to Ca²⁺, so the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M? If so, then when the complex dissociates, it will produce Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ in equal amounts.\n\nBut let me make sure. In such cases, the dissociation of Ca-EDTA would be: Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻. So the equilibrium concentrations would be: [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, and [Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x. But since K is very large (5e10), the dissociation x would be very small, right? So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then plugging into the expression: K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02/(x^2) = 5e10. Therefore, x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13. Taking square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.32e-7 M? Wait, is that right?\n\nBut wait, let\'s check if I used the correct K. The problem mentions K_{Ca-EDTA} as 5x10^10, which is the formation constant. So indeed, the formula K = [complex]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA]) applies. Therefore, yes, since the complex is 0.02 M and K is 5e10, solving for x (which is [Ca²⁺] and [EDTA⁴⁻]) gives x ≈ sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.324... So 2e-6.324 is the same as 10^(-6.324) * 2. Let me compute 10^(-6) is 1e-6, 10^(-0.324) is about 0.47. So 2 * 0.47e-6 = 0.94e-6, which is 9.4e-7. Wait, maybe I messed up the square root.\n\nWait, 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13? 0.02 is 2e-2, divided by 5e10 is (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Yes. Then square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. 6.5 is 6 + 0.5, so 10^-6.5 is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-6 * 0.316 = 3.16e-7. Then times 2 gives 6.32e-7. So approximately 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3e-7 M. That seems really low, but considering the very large stability constant, it makes sense. So is that the answer? Let me confirm once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s another way to think about it. Since it\'s a 1:1 complex, and assuming EDTA is in excess, but here it\'s stoichiometric, so the amount of EDTA equals the amount of Ca²⁺. Therefore, in solution, the dissociation would release equal parts Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Therefore, if we let the concentration of Ca²⁺ be x, EDTA⁴⁻ is also x, and the complex is 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the equation is K = 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10. Solving for x gives x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Yep, that\'s 6.32e-7. So rounding maybe to two significant figures, since K was given as 5e10 (1 sig fig) and concentration is 0.02 M (1 sig fig as well?), but the answer is so small. Wait, 0.02 is two significant figures. K is 5x10^10 which is one. Hmmm, does that mean we should have one significant figure in the answer? So 6e-7 M? But sometimes, in such problems, the K is considered exact, perhaps? Or the 0.02 is two, and K maybe one, so the answer would be two sig figs? How do they handle that here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should use more precise calculation.\n\nSo K = 5e10 = 5.0x10^10? Then 0.02 is 2.0x10^-2. Then doing 2.0x10^-2 / (5.0x10^10) = 0.4x10^-12 = 4.0x10^-13. Square root is sqrt(4.0x10^-13) = 2.0x10^-6.5. 10^-6.5 is 3.162x10^-7, so 2*3.162x10^-7=6.324x10^-7. So 6.3x10^-7 M, which is two significant figures? But 5e10 is one sig fig. So in terms of significant figures, should we write it as 6x10^-7? Hmm, maybe.\n\nBut I think in the context of such problems, sometimes the K is given with one significant figure, but since it\'s a very large number, maybe the result is given with one significant figure. Alternatively, the problem states 0.02 M (which is two sig figs), so maybe the answer should have two sig figs. However, if the K is only one sig fig, then the answer could be one. But different professors might handle this differently. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is to be left as sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) written in scientific notation, but the question asks for the concentration, so in terms of value.\n\nBut regardless, the main calculation leads to approximately 6.3e-7 M, so let\'s say 6.3x10^-7 M, which would be 6.3e-7 M. But the exact value if computed:\n\nsqrt(0.02 / 5e10) is sqrt((2e-2)/(5e10)) = sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 10^(-6.5) = 2 * (10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5)) = 2 * 10^(-6) / sqrt(10) ≈ 2 * 10^(-6) / 3.162 ≈ 0.632 * 10^(-6) ≈ 6.32 * 10^(-7). So 6.32e-7 M. So approximately 6.3e-7 M. It would be written as 6.3 x 10^-7 M. If the answer needs two significant figures, maybe 6.3 x 10^-7, if one, then 6 x 10^-7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects an exact expression. Let me see. For such problems with very large K, sometimes they approximate that the dissociation is negligible, but since K is given, we can\'t ignore it. Wait, but it\'s a very stable complex, so even with small dissociation, but I think the approach is correct.\n\nBut let me verify again. Let\'s take the dissociation equation:\n\nCa-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nAt equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, [Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n\nTherefore, K_formation = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10. Thus, x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13.\n\nTherefore, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7 M.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M. So I think that\'s right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering activity coefficients, but since the solution is ideal (as per the problem statement: "we assume that the pH is ideal"), maybe activities are taken as concentrations, so we don\'t need to adjust for activity coefficients.\n\nSo yes, the answer should be approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M. So written in box notation, we can write \\boxed{6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe concentration of calcium ions is \\boxed{6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744973226, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2471, prompt_tokens=352, total_tokens=2823, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The stability constant \( K \) for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \). The stability constant expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation of the complex is very small due to the large stability constant. Let \( x \) be the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium. Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations are approximately:

\[
[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x
\]
\[
[\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting these into the stability constant expression:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 10^{-6} \times 10^{-0.5} \approx 2 \times 3.162 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is:

\[
\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}

sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) is sqrt((2e-2)/(5e10)) = sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 10^(-6.5) = 2 * (10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5)) = 2 * 10^(-6) / sqrt(10) ≈ 2 * 10^(-6) / 3.162 ≈ 0.632 * 10^(-6) ≈ 6.32 * 10^(-7). So 6.32e-7 M. So approximately 6.3e-7 M. It would be written as 6.3 x 10^-7 M. If the answer needs two significant figures, maybe 6.3 x 10^-7, if one, then 6 x 10^-7.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects an exact expression. Let me see. For such problems with very large K, sometimes they approximate that the dissociation is negligible, but since K is given, we can't ignore it. Wait, but it's a very stable complex, so even with small dissociation, but I think the approach is correct.

But let me verify again. Let's take the dissociation equation:

Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

At equilibrium, [Ca²⁺] = x, [EDTA⁴⁻] = x, [Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Therefore, K_formation = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10. Thus, x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13.

Therefore, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7 M.

Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M. So I think that's right.

Alternatively, maybe considering activity coefficients, but since the solution is ideal (as per the problem statement: "we assume that the pH is ideal"), maybe activities are taken as concentrations, so we don't need to adjust for activity coefficients.

So yes, the answer should be approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M. So written in box notation, we can write \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

However, since K is very large, x is expected to be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n\nSubstituting into K: K = 0.02/(x^2) → x^2 = 0.02 / K. Plugging in K = 5e10, x^2 = 0.02 /5e10 = 4e-13, so x = sqrt(4e-13) ≈ 2e-6.5 M. Wait, 2e-13\'s square root is approx 6.3e-7. Let\'s do exact:\n\n0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = 4e-13?

So yes, x^2 = 4e-13, so x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 10^(-6.5) M.\n\nBut 10^(-6.5) is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3e-7 M. Is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nAlternative approach: Let’s suppose we have the dissolution of Ca-EDTA:\n\nCa-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nHence, K_d = 1/K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = (x)(x)/ (0.02) ) = x²/0.02 = 1/(5e10). Therefore, x² = (0.02)/(5e10) = 4e-13. So x = 2e-6.5, same as before, 6.3e-7 M.\n\nExpressed in scientific notation, it would be 6.3x10^-7 M, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M. However, perhaps this isn\'t exact? Let me check.\n\nWait 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. Then sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. 6.5 is 13/2. So 2e-6.5 is the same as 2*10^(-6.5) = 2*3.162*10^-7 = 6.324*10^-7 M. So to two significant figures, it would be 6.3x10^-7. But since the problem gives 5x10^10 (one sig fig), but perhaps the answer should not be two sig figs.

But given the original data, since K is given as 5e10 (1 significant figure), to be precise, x is on the order of 6e-7. But some might take the two from concentration. However, when multiplying/division, the least number of significant figures should determine the answer. So 5e10 (1 sig fig) and 0.02 (1 or 2). In 0.02, trailing zeros in decimal numbers are significant. So 0.02 has two sig figs? Wait, 0.02 – the leading zeros are not significant, trailing? Since it\'s written as 0.02, the two is the only significant digit, right? Wait, no. The number has one significant figure because the leading zeros are placeholders.

The problem gives 0.02; typically, here, in chemistry, 0.02 is two decimal places, but the significance is (if someone writes 0.02 it\'s considered one or two???). Hmm, for example, 0.02 could be written as 2e-2, which is 1 sig fig. But that\'s a notation issue. If it\'s written as 0.02, depending on context, people might consider it as two. However, the correct rule is that zeros after the decimal are significant if they are after a non-zero digit. So 0.02 has one significant figure, the 2. So yes, both K and concentration have one sig fig. Thus, answer is 6e-7. But in reality, maybe the problem expects two sig figs? Since sometimes in exams, for example, 0.02 is considered as two. It\'s ambiguous, but for K=5x10^10 is 1 sig fig regardless. Therefore, even if 0.02 is two sig figs, the answer would still be limited to 1. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: I think often, when problems like this are given using numbers like 0.02, 0.10 etc., they usually write 0.02 M as two sig figs, since 0.02 can sometimes be considered two (some chemists view numbers before the decimal requiring more scrutiny). To resolve this, perhaps the answer here would prefer two sig figs. So 6.3e-7 M. Probably since 0.02 has two. Let me confirm, yes, leading zeros are never significant. So even though 0.02 has two decimal places, the zeros are not significant. Only the 2 is. Therefore, 0.02 M is one sig fig. But that feels counterintuitive. Wait: If I have 0.02 grams, that\'s 20 milligrams. If 0.02 has one sig fig, then 20 mg would also have one? But 20 would have two. Hmmm. No, this is an inconsistency between decimal notation and other units. Maybe the confusion arises here. Wait, numbers without a decimal: 20 mg is considered 1 sig fig if written as 2x10^1; with a trailing zero it\'s ambiguous. However, 20. mg is two. So maybe similarly, 0.02 is two because the zeros are after the decimal? Wait, no. The rules are:\n\nLeading zeros (zeros preceding non-zero digits) are not significant. For example, 0.0025 has two significant figures: 2 and 5.\n\nTrailing zeros in a number containing a decimal point are significant. For example, 0.200 has three significant figures, 2.0 has two, and 20.0 has three.\n\nBut in0.02, the trailing zero is before the decimal and after a non-zero digit? Wait, no. In 0.02, after the decimal but between a leading zero and a non-zero digit. I think the confusion is that if it\'s written as 0.02, the only significant figure is the 2. Even if the user intended two, per standard rules, it\'s one. So maybe K is one and concentration is one, leading to the answer\'s one. So 6e-7 M.\n\nBut this seems very low. Wait, given that K is 5e10, which is log K ~10.7, very large. So the concentration of free Ca²+ is indeed negligible. Let me check using approximation. For a K that large, let\'s approximate.\n\nAssume that x << 0.02, so complex remains 0.02. Then K=[Ca-EDTA]/[Ca²+][EDTA]. Since EDTA is same as Ca²+ (x), then K=0.02/(x^2). Therefore, x=√(0.02/K). √(0.02 / 5e10) = √(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.3e-7.\n\nSo yes, that\'s the correct calculation.\n\nBut how to present it? If both values are considered 1 sig fig, but 0.02 is 2, then how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is given as approximately 6.3e-7, but in proper sig figs via rules it would be 6e-7 if both are 1, but since 0.02 is 1 sig fig (defined as such), the answer is 6e-7. But unclear. Alternatively, if 0.02 is 2, then with K=5e10 (1), but when dividing 0.02 (2) by 5e10 (1), lest take 1 sig fig, so answer is 6e-7.\n\nAlternatively, the person who wrote the question might be assuming 2 sig figs for all parts, so answer 6.3e-7. Since the problem states "0.02 M" which might be intended as two, and K is "5x10^10" which is one. Therefore, the answer should use one significant digit. So 6e-7 is appropriate, but may vary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should present both and note the ambiguity, but since the numbers are given, perhaps the answer box allows scientific notation input. As the problem says "stochastic Ca-EDTA complex", perhaps we are to assume ideal conditions. Anyway, the numeric value is around 6.3e-7 M. But in exams, the answer choice would probably take two digits. Wait, the original Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. Let\'s do calculation again: 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = 0.4e-12. sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 as above ≈ 6.32e-7.\n\nGiven that, the precise answer is 6.3e-7. If possible, retain two sig figs, but if the K is one, maybe not. Hmmm. But the problem didn\'t specify anything about the significant figures. So perhaps present the answer as 6.3x10^-7 M. Alternatively, as a token of exactness, give the exact expression: sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).\n\nAlternatively, since some textbooks use strict significant figures with the minimal count: here, since K is 1 and 0.02 is 1 or 2, it\'s possible the answer requires either 6e-7 (if 1 sig) or 6.3e-7 (if 2). Therefore, in exams, if in doubt, I think people present the precise answer as a numerical calculation and leave to the grader, but the precise value is 6.3e-7.\n\nIn the answer the problem might be expecting 6.3e-7. So let me check a standard problem of this type. EDTA stability constant problems always assume if K is high, then free metal ion concentration is sqrt(C/K), basically. So for Ca-EDTA with K of 5e10 and 0.02 M, [Ca²+] = sqrt(0.02 /5e10). Which numerically is sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5= 6.3e-7. So that’s precise.\n\nTherefore, although the problem didn\'t specify significant figures, the answer is 6.3e-7 M.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex solution with a stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \):

1. **Reaction and Stability Constant**:
   \[
   \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}
   \]
   The stability constant is given by:
   \[
   K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} = 5 \times 10^{10}
   \]

2. **Assumptions**:
   - Since the solution is stoichiometric and \( K \) is very large, the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is minimal. Thus, the concentration of the complex can be approximated as 0.02 M.
   - Let \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = x\). Because EDTA and \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) are in a 1:1 ratio, \([ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\).

3. **Substitute into the Stability Constant**:
   \[
   5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   The concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M} \).

\[
\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}
\]

charging the solution. Let the concentration of Ca²⁺ be x; then EDTA⁴⁻ will also be x. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x. However, since K is very large, x is expected to be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Substituting into K: K = 0.02/(x^2) → x^2 = 0.02 / K. Plugging in K = 5e10, x^2 = 0.02 /5e10 = 4e-13, so x = sqrt(4e-13) ≈ 2e-6.5 M. Wait, 2e-13's square root is approx 6.3e-7. Let's do exact:

0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = 4e-13? Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13? Wait, actually 2/5 is 0.4. 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So yes, x^2 = 4e-13, so x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 10^(-6.5) M.

But 10^(-6.5) is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Therefore, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.3e-7 M. Is that correct? Let me verify.

Alternative approach: Let’s suppose we have the dissolution of Ca-EDTA:

Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

Hence, K_d = 1/K = [Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]/[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = (x)(x)/ (0.02) ) = x²/0.02 = 1/(5e10). Therefore, x² = (0.02)/(5e10) = 4e-13. So x = 2e-6.5, same as before, 6.3e-7 M.

Expressed in scientific notation, it would be 6.3x10^-7 M, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M. However, perhaps this isn't exact? Let me check.

Wait 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. Then sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. 6.5 is 13/2. So 2e-6.5 is the same as 2*10^(-6.5) = 2*3.162*10^-7 = 6.324*10^-7 M. So to two significant figures, it would be 6.3x10^-7. But since the problem gives 5x10^10 (one sig fig), but perhaps the answer should not be two sig figs. Wait, but the concentration given is 0.02 M, which is two sig figs, but K is given as 5e10 which is one. So maybe the answer should be written as 6e-7? Because with one significant figure. Wait, depending on steps.

But in some textbooks, if you mix numbers with different sig figs, you take the smallest. The K has one, the concentration has two, so the answer would have one sig fig. So this would be 6e-7 M.

But perhaps sometimes stoichiometric gives exact number. But better to check step by step.

The calculation is correct. The answer in two sig figs would be 6.3e-7, but given that K is 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), the answer may need to be rounded to 6e-7. However, since 0.02 has two sig figs. Maybe options... Hmm.

But let's check: in the problem statement, 0.02 M has 2 sig figs, the K is 5e10 which is 1. But when multiplying/dividing, the result has the same number of sig figs as the value with the least. So given that the K is 1 sig fig, even though 0.02 has 2, the answer must be 1 sig fig. Wait:

Original equation:

x = sqrt( (0.02)/(5e10) ) = sqrt( (2e-2)/(5e10) ) = sqrt( 0.4e-12 ) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.3e-7.

Since K is one sig fig (5e10), and 0.02 is two (which in lab we usually take as two if written as 0.02, unless specified as 0.020 then two). But given the original data, since K is given as 5e10 (1 significant figure), to be precise, x is on the order of 6e-7. But some might take the two from concentration. However, when multiplying/division, the least number of significant figures should determine the answer. So 5e10 (1 sig fig) and 0.02 (1 or 2). In 0.02, trailing zeros in decimal numbers are significant. So 0.02 has two sig figs? Wait, 0.02 – the leading zeros are not significant, trailing? Since it's written as 0.02, the two is the only significant digit, right? Wait, no. The number has one significant figure because the leading zeros are placeholders. So 0.02 would be 1 sig fig if written as 0.02, but sometimes considered 2 if written as 0.020. So maybe in this case, 0.02 would be 1 sig fig. Hmm.

If both K and concentration have 1 sig fig, then answer is 6e-7. If concentration is 2 sig figs and K is 1, perhaps answer is 6.3e-7 but underline that we use 1 sig fig. The problem gives 0.02; typically, here, in chemistry, 0.02 is two decimal places, but the significance is (if someone writes 0.02 it's considered one or two???).

To resolve this, perhaps the answer here would prefer two sig figs. So 6.3e-7 M. Probably since 0.02 has two. Let me confirm, yes, leading zeros are never significant.

Leading zeros (zeros preceding non-zero digits) are not significant. For example, 0.0025 has two significant figures: 2 and 5.

Trailing zeros in a number containing a decimal point are significant. For example, 0.200 has three significant figures, 2.0 has two, and 20.0 has three.

But in0.02, the trailing zero is before the decimal and after a non-zero digit? Wait, no. In 0.02, after the decimal but between a leading zero and a non-zero digit. I think the confusion is that if it's written as 0.02, the only significant figure is the 2. Even if the user intended two, per standard rules, it's one. So maybe K is one and concentration is one, leading to the answer's one. So 6e-7 M.

But this seems very low. Wait, given that K is 5e10, which is log K ~10.7, very large. So the concentration of free Ca²+ is indeed negligible. Let me check using approximation. For a K that large, let's approximate.

Assume that x << 0.02, so complex remains 0.02. Then K=[Ca-EDTA]/[Ca²+][EDTA]. Since EDTA is same as Ca²+ (x), then K=0.02/(x^2). Therefore, x=√(0.02/K). √(0.02 / 5e10) = √(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.3e-7.

So yes, that's the correct calculation.

But how to present it? If both values are considered 1 sig fig, but 0.02 is 2, then how?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is given as approximately 6.3e-7, but in proper sig figs via rules it would be 6e-7 if both are 1, but since 0.02 is 1 sig fig (defined as such), the answer is 6e-7. But unclear. Alternatively, if 0.02 is 2, then with K=5e10 (1), but when dividing 0.02 (2) by 5e10 (1), lest take 1 sig fig, so answer is 6e-7.

Alternatively, the person who wrote the question might be assuming 2 sig figs for all parts, so answer 6.3e-7. Since the problem states "0.02 M" which might be intended as two, and K is "5x10^10" which is one. Therefore, the answer should use one significant digit. So 6e-7 is appropriate, but may vary.

Alternatively, maybe I should present both and note the ambiguity, but since the numbers are given, perhaps the answer box allows scientific notation input. As the problem says "stochastic Ca-EDTA complex", perhaps we are to assume ideal conditions. Anyway, the numeric value is around 6.3e-7 M.

Let's do calculation again: 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = 0.4e-12. sqrt(0.4e-12) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 as above ≈ 6.32e-7.

Given that, the precise answer is 6.3e-7. If possible, retain two sig figs, but if the K is one, maybe not. Hmmm. But the problem didn't specify anything about the significant figures. So perhaps present the answer as 6.3x10^-7 M. Alternatively, as a token of exactness, give the exact expression: sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Alternatively, since some textbooks use strict significant figures with the minimal count: here, since K is 1 and 0.02 is 1 or 2, it's possible the answer requires either 6e-7 (if 1 sig) or 6.3e-7 (if 2). Therefore, in exams, if in doubt, I think people present the precise answer as a numerical calculation and leave to the grader, but the precise value is 6.3e-7.

In the answer the problem might be expecting 6.3e-7. So let me check a standard problem of this type. EDTA stability constant problems always assume if K is high, then free metal ion concentration is sqrt(C/K), basically. So for Ca-EDTA with K of 5e10 and 0.02 M, [Ca²+] = sqrt(0.02 /5e10). Which numerically is sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5= 6.3e-7. So that’s precise.

Therefore, although the problem didn't specify significant figures, the answer is 6.3e-7 M. Given that, putting as \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}} is correct.

So, the EDTA is available as Y⁴⁻ and the complex is CaY²⁻.\n\nSo, the total concentration of CaY²⁻ is 0.02 M. Let\'s let the concentration of free Ca²⁺ be x. Then, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ would also be x, since the dissociation of CaY²⁻ produces 1 mole of Ca²⁺ and 1 mole of EDTA⁴⁻. Therefore, the expression for K would be [CaY²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02/(x * x) = 5e10. So, solving for x: x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13. Therefore, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, but wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Hmm, but let me check that calculation again.\n\nWait, 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2)/(5e10) = 4e-13. Then take the square root: sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. But 1e-6.5 is 1e-6 * 1e-0.5 ≈ 1e-6 * 0.316, so 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. That would be [Ca²⁺]. But wait, let me confirm the setup. Did I account for the fact that EDTA is in excess? Wait, the problem says "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex", so that the solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA. Therefore, the total EDTA should be all tied up in the complex. Hmm, but upon dissociation, some EDTA is released. But given that K is so large, the dissociation is minimal.\n\nWait, another way to approach: the dissociation of Ca-EDTA will produce x amounts of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Thus, the concentrations would be:\n\n[Ca²⁺] = x\n\n[EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, because x is very small.\n\nTherefore, K = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10\n\nSo x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13\n\nx = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M\n\nSo then, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Therefore, the concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M.\n\nBut maybe we can compute it more precisely. Let\'s calculate sqrt(4e-13). Since 4e-13 is 4 multiplied by 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. So, indeed, 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2e-6.5. Converting exponent 6.5 is 6 + 0.5, which is 6 + log10(sqrt(10)). Actually, 1e-6.5 = 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-6 * 0.3162, so 2 * 0.3162e-6 ≈ 6.324e-7. So that is approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M.\n\nTherefore, the free calcium concentration is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem expects a more exact answer, given that K is 5e10, so exact. Let\'s recompute:\n\n0.02 M divided by 5e10 is 0.02/(5e10) = 0.004 x 10^-10 = 4e-13.\n\nSquare root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. Now, 1e-6.5 is 1e-6 times 10^-0.5 which is about 0.31623, so 2 * 0.31623e-6 = 6.3245e-7. So approximately 6.32e-7 M. So, writing this as 6.3 x 10^-7 M, or perhaps in scientific notation as 6.3e-7 M.\n\nBut maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check again:\n\nsqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-13)^(1/2) = 2 * 1e-6.5. The exponent 6.5 is correct because 1e-13 is 10^-13, so sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5. So yes, that\'s 10^-6.5, and as I calculated. So I think 6.3e-7 M is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate 10^-6.5. Since 10^0.5≈3.1623, so 10^-0.5≈0.31623. Therefore, 10^-6.5 = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 ≈ 1e-6 * 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-7. Wait, no. Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, no, if we have 10^-6.5 = 10^(-6 + 0.5) = 10^-6 * 10^0.5, but that\'s not correct. Wait, no: actually, 10^-6.5 = 10^-(6 + 0.5) = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5.\n\nSo, 10^-0.5 is 1/sqrt(10) ≈ 0.31623. So 10^-6.5 ≈ 3.1623e-7. Therefore, 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.3246e-7. So, 6.32e-7 M.\n\nSo the concentration is approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M.\n\nBut let me also confirm my initial assumption. Do I consider that [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M, and that when it dissociates, it produces equal parts Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻? Yes, because the stoichiometry is 1:1. Therefore, if some complex dissociates, the amount of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are both x. But since EDTA is fully deprotonated, we don\'t have to consider other protonation states. The pH is ideal, so the EDTA is in Y⁴⁻ form. So the only species are Ca²⁺, Y⁴⁻, and CaY²⁻.\n\nIn that case, the setup is correct. So upon dissociation, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are equal. So substituting into the K expression gives the equation to solve for x. And since K is very large, the dissociation x is very small, so [CaY²⁻] ≈ 0.02 M. Therefore, the approximation is valid. Because 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 when x is ~1e-7, compared to 0.02 M.\n\nTherefore, the calculated value is valid. Thus, the calcium ion concentration is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n\nBut just to ensure there\'s no step I missed. For example, did the problem say "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex," meaning that EDTA and Ca²⁺ were mixed in a 1:1 ratio to form the complex? So in the solution, all the Ca²⁺ is initially in the complex. Therefore, since K is large, the amount that dissociates is negligible. But even so, the small x is the amount that does dissociate.\n\nAnother check: in a solution where the complex is the only source of both Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻, then the concentrations of [Ca²⁺] and [EDTA⁴⁻] must be equal. Because for every Ca²⁺ that dissociates, one EDTA⁴⁻ is also released. Hence, the setup where [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x is correct.\n\nSo putting that into the K expression:\n\nK = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = (0.02 - x) / (x^2) ≈ 0.02 / x² = 5e10\n\nHence, x ≈ sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7 M. Which is consistent.\n\nSo I think this is the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. To express this in scientific notation, it\'s 6.3 x 10^-7 M.\n\nBut let me check once more with more precise calculation:\n\n0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004 / 1e10 = 4e-3 / 1e10 = 4e-13\n\nsqrt(4e-13) = 2 * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5\n\nBut 1e-6.5 can be expressed as 10^(-6.5) = e^(-6.5 * ln(10)) ≈ e^(-6.5 * 2.302585) ≈ e^(-14.9668) ≈ 3.1623e-7\n\nWait, that actually gives the same result. So 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.3245e-7. Rounded to two significant figures, since K is given as 5e10 (one significant figure) and the concentration 0.02 M (two significant figures). Since K has only one significant figure, but 0.02 has two, the answer should perhaps be rounded to one significant figure, but perhaps two. Hmm.\n\nWait, if K is given as 5x10^10 (one significant figure) and concentration is 0.02 M (two significant figures), then according to rules, the answer\'s precision should be limited by the least precise value, which is K with one significant figure. Therefore, 6.3e-7 is two significant figures, so maybe we need to round it to 6e-7 (one significant figure). Wait, but perhaps when dealing with log K values, they often are reported with one or two decimal places, but the user gave K as 5x10^10. So 5 is one significant figure. Then when calculating x, which is sqrt(4e-13), 4 has one significant figure (from 0.02 M, which is two, but in the problem, the 0.02 M is given as "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex" but, is 0.02 two significant figures? 0.02 could be considered one or two, depending on how it was measured. If written as 0.02, it\'s ambiguous. In many contexts, 0.02 M is one significant figure, unless there’s a decimal after, like 0.020, then two.\n\nBut assuming the problem states 0.02 as two significant figures (maybe not), but if it\'s one, then the answer should have one too. Let\'s check:\n\nIf K is 5e10 (1 sig fig) and concentration is 0.02 M (1 sig fig), then x^2 = (0.02)/(5e10) = 4e-13. 4e-13, but since both are 1 sig fig, it\'s actually 0.02 is approx 2e-2 (1 sig: 2e-2), divided by 5e10 (1 sig: 5e10), so 2e-2 / 5e10 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13 (but in 1 sig fig, 4e-13 becomes 4e-13 or maybe 0.4e-12, but the answer would be sqrt(4e-13) ~ 6e-7 (1 sig fig). If 0.02 is 1 sig, and K is 1, sig, answer is 6e-7. If 0.02 is two, then answer is 6.3e-7, which is two.\n\nThe problem says "0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex". If "0.02" has a decimal, but no trailing zero, it\'s one significant figure. If was "0.020", two. But since it\'s "0.02", in many contexts, it\'s one, but in some, especially if coming from a more precise measurement, two. Hmm, given that EDTA is usually prepared with precise concentrations, maybe it\'s two. Wait, but in some notation, 0.02 is two sig figs: the leading zeros don\'t count, but the 2 and the non-leading zero after the decimal? No, in 0.02, leading zeros are not significant, so only the 2 is. Therefore, 0.02 is one significant figure.\n\nWait, confusion. In standard sig fig rules, leading zeros are not significant. So 0.02 has one significant figure (the 2). If it\'s written as 0.020, then two (the 2 and the trailing zero). So if the problem states "0.02", then it\'s one sig fig. Therefore, x would be sqrt(0.02 /5e10) ~ sqrt(4e-13) ~ 6e-7 M (1 sig fig). But our calculation gives approximately 6.3e-7. If we are to consider significant figures, we should write it as 6e-7 M. However, if the user considers 0.02 as two sig figs (for example, in some regions or contexts), then 6.3e-7 with two sig figs. Since the problem is a chemistry problem, perhaps assuming the proper sig figs: K is 5e10 (1 sig fig), and 0.02 M (1 sig fig). Therefore, the answer is 6e-7 M (1 sig).\n\nBut the way, in the initial problem, the user wrote "5x10^10" which is 1 significant figure. Then the Ca-EDTA is given as "0.02 M", which is also one significant figure. Therefore, answer should be one significant figure.\n\nHence, the concentration of calcium ions is 6 x 10^-7 M. So 6e-7 M.\n\nBut wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 6.3e-7, which is 6.3, so 6e-7 with 1 sig fig.\n\nAlternatively, if we used exact calculation, we can write 2 x 10^-6.5. Hmm, but that\'s unconventional. Alternatively, engineering notation... not sure. But since the problem may require an approximate answer, or use logarithms. Wait, sometimes people use pCa = -log[Ca²⁺]. Maybe the answer is expected in terms of pCa? Wait, the question asks for concentration, but if required, perhaps we need to present it in moles per liter. Given that the answer is around 6.3e-7 M.\n\nAlternatively, is there a different approach?\n\nSuppose we consider the dissociation of Ca-EDTA:\n\nCa-EDTA²⁻ ↔ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe stability constant K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nBut since EDTA is in excess... No, in this case, they said it\'s stoichiometric, so EDTA and Ca²⁺ were added in 1:1. But when dissolved, the complex dissociates slightly. Thus, even though the initial concentrations are 1:1, the slight dissociation gives very low [Ca²⁺]. Therefore, considering that:\n\nK = [CaY²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5e10.\n\nAt equilibrium, [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\n[Ca²⁺] = x\n\n[Y⁴⁻] = x\n\nHence, (0.02)/(x²) = 5e10\n\n=> x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13\n\n=> x = 2e-6.5 = 6.3e-7 M\n\nSo that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore, despite considering that the solution was stoichiometric, because the K is so large, the approximation holds.\n\nThus, the answer is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M, but reduced to one significant figure, it\'s 6 x 10^-7 M.\n\nWait, but I\'m a bit conflicted because sometimes, including in textbooks, when there\'s a very small dissociation, they might carry two sig figs even if some values are given with one. The problem states "0.02 M" – if that is two sig figs, then 0.020 would be two, but 0.02 is ambiguous. In scientific notation, 0.02 M is 2 x 10^-2, so one significant figure. So K is 5x10^10, one sig fig, and Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M = 2 x 10^-2, one sig fig. So the answer has one sig fig: 6 x 10^-7.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be \\boxed{6 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}}.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps the answer accepts two sig figs. If so, then 6.3 x 10^-7. Alternatively, depending on the problem\'s context, given that K is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig) and concentration as 0.02 (1), I\'ll stick to one sig fig.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the constant is given as 5x10^10. If the problem had given log K, and if log K is 10.7 (for example), but here it\'s given as 5x10^10. The 5 in 5x10^10 is one sig fig, so all subsequent answers are one sig fig. So final answer is 6 x 10^-7 M.\n\nBut again, in my earlier calculation, with 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13. Then sqrt is 2e-6.5. So, about 6.3e-7. If we strictly take one sig fig, it\'s 6e-7. So in LaTeX, that would be:\n\n\\boxed{6 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}}\n\nBut since the user is likely from an educational background, sometimes instructors might want two sig figs here, even though given data has one. Maybe. If the problem uses K as 5.0x10^10, it would be two sig figs, but they wrote 5x10^10. So 5 is one digit, maybe.\n\nIf I follow significant figures strictly, then yes, 6e-7 M. If I write 6.3e-7 M, then the user might think it\'s incorrect for not matching sig figs. Therefore, safest answer is 6 x 10^-7 M. So boxed.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe concentration of calcium ions is \\boxed{6 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744973500, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4816, prompt_tokens=341, total_tokens=5157, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex with a stability constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \) at 25 °C and ideal pH:

1. **Reaction Considered**: The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex is:
   \[
   \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
   \]
   The stability constant \( K \) is given by:
   \[
   K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
   \]

2. **Equilibrium Concentrations**: Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \( x \). Since the dissociation is minimal, the concentration of \(\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}\) remains approximately 0.02 M.

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   \[
   K = \frac{0.02}{x^2} = 5 \times 10^{10}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}
   \]

5. **Significant Figures**: Given that the stability constant \( K \) and the concentration of Ca-EDTA are provided with one significant figure, the final answer should be rounded to one significant figure.

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

Wait, but in solution, EDTA can have different protonation states, but the problem says the pH is ideal, which probably means it's buffered at a pH where EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, i.e., Y⁴⁻. So, the EDTA is available as Y⁴⁻ and the complex is CaY²⁻.

So, the total concentration of CaY²⁻ is 0.02 M. Let's let the concentration of free Ca²⁺ be x. Then, the concentration of EDTA⁴⁻ would also be x, since the dissociation of CaY²⁻ produces 1 mole of Ca²⁺ and 1 mole of EDTA⁴⁻. Therefore, the expression for K would be [CaY²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02/(x * x) = 5e10. So, solving for x: x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13. Therefore, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, but wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Hmm, but let me check that calculation again.

Wait, 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02 / 5e10 = (2e-2)/(5e10) = 4e-13. Then take the square root: sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. But 1e-6.5 is 1e-6 * 1e-0.5 ≈ 1e-6 * 0.316, so 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M. That would be [Ca²⁺]. But wait, let me confirm the setup. Did I account for the fact that EDTA is in excess? Wait, the problem says "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex", so that the solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA. Therefore, the total EDTA should be all tied up in the complex. Hmm, but upon dissociation, some EDTA is released. But given that K is so large, the dissociation is minimal.

Wait, another way to approach: the dissociation of Ca-EDTA will produce x amounts of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Thus, the concentrations would be:

[Ca²⁺] = x

[EDTA⁴⁻] = x

[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, because x is very small.

Therefore, K = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10

So x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-13

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M

So then, [Ca²⁺] ≈ 6.32e-7 M. Therefore, the concentration is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

But maybe we can compute it more precisely. Let's calculate sqrt(4e-13). Since 4e-13 is 4 multiplied by 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. So, indeed, 2 * 1e-6.5 = 2e-6.5. Converting exponent 6.5 is 6 + 0.5, which is 6 + log10(sqrt(10)). Actually, 1e-6.5 = 10^(-6.5) = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-6 * 0.3162, so 2 * 0.3162e-6 ≈ 6.324e-7. So that is approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M.

Therefore, the free calcium concentration is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

But wait, maybe the problem expects a more exact answer, given that K is 5e10, so exact. Let's recompute:

0.02 M divided by 5e10 is 0.02/(5e10) = 0.004 x 10^-10 = 4e-13.

Square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5. Now, 1e-6.5 is 1e-6 times 10^-0.5 which is about 0.31623, so 2 * 0.31623e-6 = 6.3245e-7. So approximately 6.32e-7 M. So, writing this as 6.3 x 10^-7 M, or perhaps in scientific notation as 6.3e-7 M.

But maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check again:

sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-13)^(1/2) = 2 * 1e-6.5. The exponent 6.5 is correct because 1e-13 is 10^-13, so sqrt(10^-13) is 10^(-13/2) = 10^-6.5. So yes, that's 10^-6.5, and as I calculated. So I think 6.3e-7 M is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate 10^-6.5. Since 10^0.5≈3.1623, so 10^-0.5≈0.31623. Therefore, 10^-6.5 = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 ≈ 1e-6 * 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-7. Wait, no. Wait, hold on:

Wait, no, if we have 10^-6.5 = 10^(-6 + 0.5) = 10^-6 * 10^0.5, but that's not correct. Wait, no: actually, 10^-6.5 = 10^-(6 + 0.5) = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5.

So, 10^-0.5 is 1/sqrt(10) ≈ 0.31623. So 10^-6.5 ≈ 3.1623e-7. Therefore, 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.3246e-7. So, 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration is approximately 6.32 x 10^-7 M.

But let me also confirm my initial assumption. Do I consider that [Ca-EDTA] is 0.02 M, and that when it dissociates, it produces equal parts Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻? Yes, because the stoichiometry is 1:1. Therefore, if some complex dissociates, the amount of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are both x. But since EDTA is fully deprotonated, we don't have to consider other protonation states. The pH is ideal, so the EDTA is in Y⁴⁻ form. So the only species are Ca²⁺, Y⁴⁻, and CaY²⁻.

In that case, the setup is correct. So upon dissociation, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are equal. So substituting into the K expression gives the equation to solve for x. And since K is very large, the dissociation x is very small, so [CaY²⁻] ≈ 0.02 M. Therefore, the approximation is valid. Because 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 when x is ~1e-7, compared to 0.02 M.

Therefore, the calculated value is valid. Thus, the calcium ion concentration is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

But just to ensure there's no step I missed. For example, did the problem say "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex," meaning that EDTA and Ca²⁺ were mixed in a 1:1 ratio to form the complex? So in the solution, all the Ca²⁺ is initially in the complex. Therefore, since K is large, the amount that dissociates is negligible. But even so, the small x is the amount that does dissociate.

Another check: in a solution where the complex is the only source of both Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻, then the concentrations of [Ca²⁺] and [EDTA⁴⁻] must be equal. Because for every Ca²⁺ that dissociates, one EDTA⁴⁻ is also released. Hence, the setup where [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] = x is correct.

So putting that into the K expression:

K = [CaY²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = (0.02 - x) / (x^2) ≈ 0.02 / x² = 5e10

Hence, x ≈ sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7 M. Which is consistent.

So I think this is the correct approach.

Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. To express this in scientific notation, it's 6.3 x 10^-7 M.

But let me check once more with more precise calculation:

0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004 / 1e10 = 4e-3 / 1e10 = 4e-13

sqrt(4e-13) = 2 * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5

But 1e-6.5 can be expressed as 10^(-6.5) = e^(-6.5 * ln(10)) ≈ e^(-6.5 * 2.302585) ≈ e^(-14.9668) ≈ 3.1623e-7

Wait, that actually gives the same result. So 2 * 3.1623e-7 ≈ 6.3245e-7. Rounded to two significant figures, since K is given as 5e10 (one significant figure) and the concentration 0.02 M (two significant figures). Since K has only one significant figure, but 0.02 has two, the answer should perhaps be rounded to one significant figure, but perhaps two. Hmm.

Wait, if K is given as 5x10^10 (one significant figure) and concentration is 0.02 M (two significant figures), then according to rules, the answer's precision should be limited by the least precise value, which is K with one significant figure. Therefore, 6.3e-7 is two significant figures, so maybe we need to round it to 6e-7 (one significant figure). Wait, but perhaps when dealing with log K values, they often are reported with one or two decimal places, but the user gave K as 5x10^10. So 5 is one significant figure. Then when calculating x, which is sqrt(4e-13), 4 has one significant figure (from 0.02 M, which is two, but in the problem, the 0.02 M is given as "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex" but, is 0.02 two significant figures? 0.02 could be considered one or two, depending on how it was measured. If written as 0.02, it's ambiguous. In many contexts, 0.02 M is one significant figure, unless there’s a decimal after, like 0.020, then two.

But assuming the problem states 0.02 as two significant figures (maybe not), but if it's one, then the answer should have one too. Let's check:

If K is 5e10 (1 sig fig) and concentration is 0.02 M (1 sig fig), then x^2 = (0.02)/(5e10) = 4e-13. 4e-13, but since both are 1 sig fig, it's actually 0.02 is approx 2e-2 (1 sig: 2e-2), divided by 5e10 (1 sig: 5e10), so 2e-2 / 5e10 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13 (but in 1 sig fig, 4e-13 becomes 4e-13 or maybe 0.4e-12, but the answer would be sqrt(4e-13) ~ 6e-7 (1 sig fig). If 0.02 is 1 sig, and K is 1, sig, answer is 6e-7. If 0.02 is two, then answer is 6.3e-7, which is two.

The problem says "0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex". If "0.02" has a decimal, but no trailing zero, it's one significant figure. If was "0.020", two. But since it's "0.02", in many contexts, it's one, but in some, especially if coming from a more precise measurement, two. Hmm, given that EDTA is usually prepared with precise concentrations, maybe it's two. Wait, but in some notation, 0.02 is two sig figs: the leading zeros don't count, but the 2 and the non-leading zero after the decimal? No, in 0.02, leading zeros are not significant, so only the 2 is. Therefore, 0.02 is one significant figure.

Wait, confusion. In standard sig fig rules, leading zeros are not significant. So 0.02 has one significant figure (the 2). If it's written as 0.020, then two (the 2 and the trailing zero). So if the problem states "0.02", then it's one sig fig. Therefore, x would be sqrt(0.02 /5e10) ~ sqrt(4e-13) ~ 6e-7 M (1 sig fig). But our calculation gives approximately 6.3e-7. If we are to consider significant figures, we should write it as 6e-7 M. However, if the user considers 0.02 as two sig figs (for example, in some regions or contexts), then 6.3e-7 with two sig figs. Since the problem is a chemistry problem, perhaps assuming the proper sig figs: K is 5e10 (1 sig fig), and 0.02 M (1 sig fig). Therefore, the answer is 6e-7 M (1 sig).

But the way, in the initial problem, the user wrote "5x10^10" which is 1 significant figure. Then the Ca-EDTA is given as "0.02 M", which is also one significant figure. Therefore, answer should be one significant figure.

Hence, the concentration of calcium ions is 6 x 10^-7 M. So 6e-7 M.

But wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 6.3e-7, which is 6.3, so 6e-7 with 1 sig fig.

Alternatively, if we used exact calculation, we can write 2 x 10^-6.5. Hmm, but that's unconventional. Alternatively, engineering notation... not sure. But since the problem may require an approximate answer, or use logarithms. Wait, sometimes people use pCa = -log[Ca²⁺]. Maybe the answer is expected in terms of pCa? Wait, the question asks for concentration, but if required, perhaps we need to present it in moles per liter. Given that the answer is around 6.3e-7 M.

Alternatively, is there a different approach?

Suppose we consider the dissociation of Ca-EDTA:

Ca-EDTA²⁻ ↔ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

The stability constant K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

But since EDTA is in excess... No, in this case, they said it's stoichiometric, so EDTA and Ca²⁺ were added in 1:1. But when dissolved, the complex dissociates slightly. Thus, even though the initial concentrations are 1:1, the slight dissociation gives very low [Ca²⁺]. Therefore, considering that:

K = [CaY²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][Y⁴⁻]) = 5e10.

At equilibrium, [CaY²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02

[Ca²⁺] = x

[Y⁴⁻] = x

Hence, (0.02)/(x²) = 5e10

=> x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13

=> x = 2e-6.5 = 6.3e-7 M

So that's correct.

Therefore, despite considering that the solution was stoichiometric, because the K is so large, the approximation holds.

Thus, the answer is approximately 6.3 x 10^-7 M, but reduced to one significant figure, it's 6 x 10^-7 M.

Wait, but I'm a bit conflicted because sometimes, including in textbooks, when there's a very small dissociation, they might carry two sig figs even if some values are given with one. The problem states "0.02 M" – if that is two sig figs, then 0.020 would be two, but 0.02 is ambiguous. In scientific notation, 0.02 M is 2 x 10^-2, so one significant figure. So K is 5x10^10, one sig fig, and Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M = 2 x 10^-2, one sig fig. So the answer has one sig fig: 6 x 10^-7.

Therefore, the final answer should be \boxed{6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.

But to confirm, perhaps the answer accepts two sig figs. If so, then 6.3 x 10^-7. Alternatively, depending on the problem's context, given that K is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig) and concentration as 0.02 (1), I'll stick to one sig fig.

But wait, another thought: the constant is given as 5x10^10. If the problem had given log K, and if log K is 10.7 (for example), but here it's given as 5x10^10. The 5 in 5x10^10 is one sig fig, so all subsequent answers are one sig fig. So final answer is 6 x 10^-7 M.

But again, in my earlier calculation, with 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13. Then sqrt is 2e-6.5. So, about 6.3e-7. If we strictly take one sig fig, it's 6e-7. So in LaTeX, that would be:

\boxed{6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}

But since the user is likely from an educational background, sometimes instructors might want two sig figs here, even though given data has one. Maybe. If the problem uses K as 5.0x10^10, it would be two sig figs, but they wrote 5x10^10. So 5 is one digit, maybe.

If I follow significant figures strictly, then yes, 6e-7 M. If I write 6.3e-7 M, then the user might think it's incorrect for not matching sig figs. Therefore, safest answer is 6 x 10^-7 M. So boxed.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.
