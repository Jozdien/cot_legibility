In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations are modified to account for magnetic charge density (ρₘ) and magnetic current density (Jₘ):

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:  
   Original:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$  
   Modified:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m$$  
   This introduces magnetic charge density (ρₘ) as a source for the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, analogous to electric charge density in Gauss's Law for electric fields.

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**:  
   Original:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$  
   Modified:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m$$  
   The magnetic current density (Jₘ) acts as an additional source term, analogous to how electric current (Jₑ) appears in Ampère's Law.

**Unchanged Equations**:  
- **Gauss's Law for Electricity**:  
  $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}$$  
- **Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition)**:  
  $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_e$$  

The symmetry between electric and magnetic phenomena is restored by these modifications, allowing for magnetic monopoles and their associated dynamics.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which Maxwell's equations would change if there were isolated magnetic monopoles, like a single north or south pole existing on its own. I remember that in our universe, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields interact, and that magnetic monopoles don't exist here—meaning every magnet has a north and south pole. But in this parallel universe, they do, so something must be different in the equations. 

Let me try to recall the four Maxwell's equations. The first one is Gauss's Law for electric fields, which says that the divergence of the electric field is equal to the charge density divided by epsilon zero. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero—that's the one that would be different, right? Because if there are isolated magnetic charges, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. 

Then there's Faraday's Law, which relates the curl of the electric field to the negative rate of change of the magnetic field. And Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which relates the curl of the magnetic field to the current density plus the displacement current. Hmm. Faraday's Law has the time derivative of B, and Ampère's has the time derivative of E. 

So in our universe, since there are no magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B is zero. But if monopoles exist, that equation would have a term similar to Gauss's Law for electricity. So Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. What about Faraday's Law or Ampère's Law? Wait, in the presence of magnetic currents, which would exist if there are moving magnetic charges, maybe Faraday's Law would have an extra term. 

Wait, in the standard equations, the source terms are electric charges and currents. If there are magnetic charges, they would act as sources for the magnetic fields, like electric charges do for electric fields. Additionally, moving magnetic charges (magnetic currents) would perhaps affect the electric field in a way similar to how electric currents affect the magnetic field. 

So in our equations, the sources are:
- Electric charge density (rho_e) in Gauss's Law (div E = rho_e / epsilon_0)
- Electric current density (J_e) in Ampère's Law (curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e)
- No magnetic charge density (div B = 0)
- Faraday's Law (curl E = - dB/dt)
But if there are magnetic monopoles, we would need to include a magnetic charge density (rho_m) in Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B = mu_0 rho_m?), and a magnetic current density (J_m) in Faraday's Law, maybe as a source term. 

I think that when you have magnetic monopoles, to make the equations symmetric, you need to add terms. So the modified Maxwell equations would then be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = mu_0 rho_m
3. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m / epsilon_0 (or with some other constant?)
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

Wait, but the signs and constants might be different. Let me check. If we're following the symmetry, then each "charge" has its own Gauss's Law, and each "current" would be a source in the curl equations for the other field. 

In standard form, Faraday's Law is curl E = -dB/dt. If there's a magnetic current J_m, analogous to J_e, then maybe Faraday's Law would gain a term proportional to J_m. Similarly, Ampère's Law might have a term related to the displacement current and another term for the electric current. 

But I need to recall the correct form. Let me think: Suppose magnetic monopoles exist. Then, similar to electric charge density rho_e, we have rho_m. For Gauss's law for B, divergence of B equals some constant times rho_m. The units would matter—maybe mu_0 rho_m?

But in SI units, electric fields and magnetic fields have different units. The divergence of E is rho / epsilon_0. So for B, divergence would be proportional to rho_m, the magnetic charge density. Let's say div B = rho_m / epsilon_m, where epsilon_m is some magnetic permittivity? Wait, but we already have mu_0, the permeability of free space. Maybe we don't need another constant—instead, in analogy, if for E it's rho_e / epsilon_0, then perhaps for B it's rho_m * mu_0. Alternatively, maybe just div B = rho_m. 

Actually, I'm not 100% sure, but the key idea is that the first Maxwell equation (Gauss's law for E) has electric charge density, and in a universe with magnetic monopoles, the second Gauss's law for B would have a magnetic charge density. So equation 2 changes from div B = 0 to div B = something * rho_m. 

Then, for Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law: If there are magnetic currents, then moving magnetic charges would produce a current J_m. In the standard Faraday's Law, the curl of E is the negative rate of change of B. If there is a magnetic current, maybe this equation gains a term proportional to J_m, similar to how Ampère's Law has J_e. Similarly, maybe Ampère's Law would stay as is? Or is there a symmetry?

Wait, actually, there's a symmetry when magnetic monopoles are introduced. The four equations would then become symmetric, with electric and magnetic charges and currents. So in that case, the Faraday's Law would have a term from the magnetic current, and Ampère's Law would have a term from the electric current. 

So the amended equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (unchanged)
2. div B = mu_0 rho_m (changed from zero)
3. curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m (added the magnetic current term)
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e (unchanged? Or also has a term?)

Wait, perhaps to make it symmetric, if electric fields are generated by electric charges and varying magnetic fields, then similarly, magnetic fields are generated by magnetic charges and varying electric fields. Oh, but in Ampère's Law, the term is the displacement current (dE/dt) plus the electric current. If we had magnetic currents, then Faraday's Law, which has dB/dt, might have a magnetic current term. 

Alternatively, think of dual symmetry. If you swap E and B (with appropriate constants), the equations should mirror each other. But considering the existing terms, in our universe, Faraday's Law is:

curl E = - dB/dt

If there are magnetic currents, then this would need to account for them. In Ampère's Law, the curl of B is mu_0 J_e + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt. So for the curl of E, to make it symmetric, perhaps:

curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m

But why negative? Wait, in Faraday's Law, the induced electric field circulates in a way that opposes the change in magnetic flux (Lenz's Law), so the negative sign. If there's a magnetic current J_m, it might add a source term. Similarly, analogous to how J_e is a source for B in Ampère's Law, J_m would be a source for E in Faraday's Law.

Therefore, the modified Maxwell's equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = mu_0 rho_m
3. curl E = - partial B / partial t - mu_0 J_m
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e

So the second and third equations would change. The first (Gauss) and fourth (Ampère) might stay the same? Wait, but Ampère's Law in our universe is curl B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt. So if we include magnetic currents, do we need to modify Ampère's Law as well?

Wait no, Ampère's Law pertains to the sources of the magnetic field, which are electric currents and displacement currents. If there's a magnetic current J_m, that would enter into Faraday's Law, not Ampère's. So Ampère's Law remains as the electric current and displacement current, while Faraday's Law gets the magnetic current term. Therefore, equations 2 (div B) and 3 (curl E) are the ones that change when magnetic monopoles exist. 

Wait, but wait: let me check again. If there's a magnetic charge density rho_m, then we need a divergence in B. So equation 2 is changed. Then, magnetic current J_m, which is the flow of magnetic charge, would contribute to Faraday's Law, as moving magnetic charges would induce an electric field, similar to how moving electric charges (currents) create a magnetic field. Hence, curl E would have a term proportional to J_m. 

In contrast, the displacement current in Ampère's Law comes from the time derivative of the electric field, similar to how the time derivative of the magnetic field is in Faraday's Law. So Ampère's Law might stay the same. Thus, equations 2 and 3 are modified.

Therefore, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations that change are Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B = 0 becomes div B = mu_0 rho_m) and Faraday's Law (curl E = -dB/dt becomes curl E = -dB/dt - mu_0 J_m). 

Wait, but is the sign correct? Let's check dimensions and consistency. In SI units, the units of E are V/m (kg·m/(s³·A)), B is tesla (kg/(s²·A)), electric charge density rho_e is C/m³ (A·s/m³), magnetic charge density rho_m would be Wb/m³ (kg/(m·s²·A)). 

Then, div E has units of (kg·m/(s³·A)) / m = kg/(s³·A·m). rho_e / epsilon_0 has units (A·s/m³) / (C²/(N·m²)) )... Hmm, epsilon_0 has units F/m = (C²·s²)/(kg·m³). So 1/epsilon_0 has units (kg·m³)/(C²·s²). Then rho_e / epsilon_0 has units (A·s/m³) * (kg·m³)/(C²·s²) ) = (A·s * kg)/(C²·s²) ). Since C = A·s, so C² = A²·s². Therefore, this becomes (A·s * kg )/( A²·s² ) ) = kg/(A·s ). Which matches the units of div E (kg/(s³·A·m)) ? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me not get bogged down with units now, but assuming the term addition is correct.

But if we follow the structure, yes, Faraday's Law would include the magnetic current term, and Gauss's Law for B would include the magnetic charge. Therefore, in conclusion, the equations that would be different in the presence of magnetic monopoles are Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law of induction. 

Therefore, the answer is that the second and third Maxwell's equations—the divergence of B and the curl of E—are different. Specifically:

Original equations:
1. ∇·E = ρₑ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t + μ₀Jₑ

With magnetic monopoles:
1. ∇·E = ρₑ/ε₀ (unchanged)
2. ∇·B = μ₀ρₘ (changed)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ (changed)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t + μ₀Jₑ (unchanged?)

But I'm a bit unsure if the permeability and permittivity constants are correctly placed. In Gauss's law for B, if it's ∇·B = ρₘ, similar to ∇·E = ρₑ/ε₀. But in SI units, maybe ∇·B = μ₀ρₘ. Alternatively, maybe magnetic charge is defined such that the equation is ∇·B = ρₘ, and then you have a different constant elsewhere. 

However, the standard way to introduce magnetic monopoles into Maxwell's equations is to modify Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. The other two equations remain the same. The exact form can depend on conventions, but generally, the presence of magnetic charge density ρₘ adds a divergence to B, and magnetic current density Jₘ adds a term to Faraday's Law. 

Therefore, the answer is that Gauss's Law for magnetism (∇·B = 0 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ρₘ) and Faraday's Law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ). So the second and third equations are modified.

I think that when you have magnetic monopoles, to make the equations symmetric, you nee

I'm attempting to determine which of Maxwell's equations would be altered if isolated magnetic monopoles existed—like a standalone north or south pole. In our actual universe, Maxwell's equations explain electric and magnetic field interactions, and magnetic monopoles don't exist (every magnet must have both north and south poles). But in a hypothetical universe where monopoles do exist, the equations would need modifications.

Recalling the four Maxwell's equations: First is Gauss's Law for electric fields, stating that the divergence of the electric field equals charge density divided by epsilon zero. Second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which says the divergence of the magnetic field is zero—this one would definitely change if monopoles existed. With isolated magnetic charges, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore but would instead be proportional to magnetic charge density.

Then there's Faraday's Law relating the curl of the electric field to the negative time rate of change of the magnetic field. Finally, Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition connects the curl of the magnetic field to current density plus displacement current. Faraday's Law contains the time derivative of B, while Ampère's has the time derivative of E.

In our universe without magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B is zero. With monopoles, that equation would need a term similar to Gauss's Law for electricity. But what about Faraday's and Ampère's Laws? If magnetic currents exist (from moving magnetic charges), Faraday's Law might require an additional term.

In the standard equations, electric charges and currents are the source terms. If magnetic charges existed, they would function as sources for magnetic fields, similar to how electric charges work for electric fields. Moving magnetic charges (magnetic currents) would likely affect the electric field analogously to how electric currents influence the magnetic field.

In our current equations, the sources are:
- Electric charge density (rho_e) in Gauss's Law: div E = rho_e/epsilon_0
- Electric current density (J_e) in Ampère's Law: curl B = mu_0*epsilon_0*dE/dt + mu_0*J_e
- No magnetic charge density: div B = 0
- Faraday's Law: curl E = -dB/dt

With magnetic monopoles, we'd need to include magnetic charge density (rho_m) in Gauss's Law for magnetism (perhaps div B = mu_0*rho_m), and potentially a magnetic current density (J_m) in Faraday's Law as a source term.

I believe that with magnetic monopoles, creating symmetric equations would be necessary.

Specifically, the presence of isolated magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles) and magnetic currents alters two of Maxwell's equations:\n\n1. **Gauss’s Law for Magnetism**: In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ · B = 0) because there are no magnetic monopoles. However, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, this equation becomes ∇ · B = μ₀ρₘ, where ρₘ is the magnetic charge density.\n\n2. **Faraday’s Law of Induction**: In our universe, Faraday’s Law is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. However, with magnetic currents (resulting from moving magnetic monopoles), this equation includes an additional term for the magnetic current density Jₘ, becoming ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ.\n\nThe other two Maxwell equations, Gauss’s Law for electric fields and Ampère’s Circuital Law (with Maxwell’s addition), remain unchanged in form.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe modified Maxwell equations in this universe are Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law. Thus, the equations that are different are:\n\\boxed{\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\rho_m}\nand\n\\boxed{\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} - \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}_m}.", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning=' d to add terms for magnetic charge and current. So the four modified Maxwell equations would be:\n\n1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n2. div B = mu_0 rho_m\n3. curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m\n4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e\n\nWait, but in the standard Ampère\'s Law, the displacement current is the derivative of E. If there\'s a magnetic current, does it add a term to Faraday\'s Law? Yes, I think so. In the absence of magnetic charges, Faraday\'s Law is just curl E = - dB/dt, but with magnetic current J_m, maybe there\'s a term proportional to J_m. Similarly, Ampère\'s Law would stay the same if there\'s no magnetic current. \n\nBut actually, if magnetic charges exist, then moving magnetic charges would produce a magnetic current, analogous to how moving electric charges produce electric current. This would mean that Faraday\'s Law, which in our universe only has the time derivative term, would also include a term from the magnetic current. So the modified Faraday\'s Law would be curl E = - dB/dt - J_m, or something like that. Similarly, Ampère\'s Law would need to account for displacement current and the electric current.\n\nTo get the units right, the terms have to be adjusted with constants. Let\'s think. In SI units, Maxwell\'s equations are:\n\n1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n2. div B = 0\n3. curl E = - dB/dt\n4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e\n\nIf monopoles exist, divergence of B is proportional to rho_m. Assume that similar to Gauss\'s law, div B = mu_0 rho_m? Or maybe another constant? Wait, in E, the divergence is rho_e / epsilon_0, so maybe symmetry would require that divergence of B is rho_m / something. Alternatively, if magnetic charge is measured in webers or some other unit, the constants may differ.\n\nBut actually, when we introduce magnetic charge, typically in theoretical physics, they would write the equations in a symmetric way. Let me recall. The standard approach when introducing magnetic monopoles is to have:\n\ndiv E = 4 pi rho_e (in Gaussian units)\ndiv B = 4 pi rho_m\ncurl E = - (1/c) dB/dt - (4 pi / c) J_m\ncurl B = (1/c) dE/dt + (4 pi / c) J_e\n\nBut SI units complicate things. However, in SI units, Maxwell\'s equations with monopoles usually have:\n\ndiv D = rho_e\ndiv B = rho_m\ncurl E = - dB/dt - J_m\ncurl H = dD/dt + J_e\n\nBut this assumes that the constitutive relations are D = epsilon_0 E + P and B = mu_0 (H + M). Hmm, perhaps this is getting too into the weeds. Let me focus on the question: which equations change.\n\nIn our universe, the equations are:\n\n1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (Gauss\'s Law)\n2. div B = 0 (Gauss\'s Law for magnetism)\n3. curl E = - partial B / partial t (Faraday\'s Law)\n4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e (Ampère\'s Law)\n\nSo, if there are magnetic monopoles, then equation 2 must change from div B = 0 to div B = something, maybe mu_0 rho_m, similar to how equation 1 is. Then, if magnetic charges can move, that would create a magnetic current, so the Faraday\'s Law, which relates curl E to -dB/dt, might also get a term related to the magnetic current. So equation 3 would become curl E = - partial B / partial t - mu_0 J_m, perhaps.\n\nBut I need to check the units. For Faraday\'s Law in SI units, the units of curl E are V/m/m = T/s (since E is V/m, curl E is per meter, so V/m^2, and dB/dt is T/s. Since 1 T = 1 kg/(s^2·A), then dB/dt has units kg/(s^3·A). Similarly, the right-hand side of Faraday\'s law has units of T/s. If J_m is a magnetic current density, then its units would be weber/(m²·s) or something. Hmm. Let\'s think. Electric current density J_e is A/m² = C/(s·m²). Magnetic charge density rho_m would have units of weber/m³, so magnetic current density J_m would be weber/(m²·s) or equivalently (T·m²)/(m²·s) = T/s. Wait, but in Faraday\'s law, the term is -dB/dt, which is T/s, so if J_m is in T/s, then it would match. But in the equation, we have:\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m\n\nIf J_m is in weber/(m²·s), then multiplying by mu_0 (which has units of H/m = T·m/A) would give mu_0 * J_m has units (T·m/A) * (Wb/(m²·s)). Since Wb is T·m², so (T·m/A) * (T·m²)/(m²·s)) = (T²·m)/(A·s). Wait, but dB/dt is T/s. These units don\'t match. Hmm, maybe there\'s a different constant?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the magnetic charge is measured in ampere-meters (A·m), similar to how electric charge is in coulombs (C = A·s). So rho_m would be A·m/m³ = A/m², which is the same as current density. Wait, that might not be right. \n\nThis is getting confusing. Let\'s approach it more carefully. In SI units, the units for magnetic charge (if it exists) would likely be webers (Wb), since magnetic flux is measured in webers, and if you have a magnetic monopole, its strength is measured in webers. Then, magnetic charge density rho_m is Wb/m³. \n\nCurrent density J_e is C/(m²·s) or A/m². Similarly, magnetic current density J_m would be Wb/(m²·s). \n\nGauss\'s Law: div E = rho_e / epsilon_0. So E has units of V/m = (J/C)/m = (N·m/C)/m = (kg·m²/(s²·C))/m = kg·m/(s²·C). Div E is kg/(s²·C·m). rho_e is C/m³, so rho_e / epsilon_0 is (C/m³)/(C²·s²/(kg·m³)) ) = kg/(s²·C·m). Units match.\n\nSimilarly, if div B = rho_m / mu_0. B has units T = kg/(s²·A). Div B is kg/(s²·A·m). rho_m is Wb/m³ = (kg·m²/(s²·A))/m³ = kg/(s²·A·m²). Then rho_m / mu_0 would be (kg/(s²·A·m²)) / (kg·m/(s²·A²))) = A/m. Wait, that\'s not the same as div B\'s units. Hmm, so maybe div B = mu_0 rho_m?\n\nmu_0 is kg·m/(s²·A²). So mu_0 rho_m is (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (kg/(s²·A·m²))) = kg²/(s^4·A³·m). Not matching div B. This suggests that perhaps there is another constant involved. Alternatively, maybe in SI units, the equations with monopoles are not as straightforward.\n\nIn the standard treatment when considering magnetic monopoles, people often use Gaussian units, where symmetry is more apparent. In Gaussian units, Maxwell\'s equations are:\n\ndiv E = 4π rho_e\ndiv B = 4π rho_m\ncurl E = -(1/c) ∂B/∂t - (4π/c) J_m\ncurl B = (1/c) ∂E/∂t + (4π/c) J_e\n\nSo in Gaussian units, the equations become symmetric with the addition of magnetic charge and current terms. Translating this into SI units might require scaling factors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in SI units, the modified equations are:\n\ndiv E = rho_e / epsilon_0\ndiv B = rho_m / epsilon_0  ??\n\nWait, but that doesn\'t make sense dimensionally. Let me think. If we want div B = rho_m / something, let\'s denote the magnetic charge density as rho_m with units of webers per cubic meter (Wb/m³), then the units of div B would be webers per meter cubed (Wb/m³) divided by something to get tesla per meter (since div B is in tesla per meter). Because B is in tesla (T), so div B is T/m. T is Wb/m², so div B is Wb/m³. So rho_m is also in Wb/m³. So if div B = rho_m, that would make the units consistent. So simply, div B = rho_m. But in that case, in SI units, what\'s the scaling? If that\'s the case, then the unit conversion is built into rho_m.\n\nBut how does this compare to electric flux? For electric fields, div E = rho_e / epsilon_0. The permittivity epsilon_0 is part of Gauss\'s Law. If we are adding magnetic charge, do we need a similar permittivity for magnetism? Wait, but the permeability mu_0 is already present in Ampère\'s Law.\n\nAlternatively, in a symmetric formulation, it\'s possible that the equations would need factors of mu_0 and epsilon_0 to relate electric and magnetic quantities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation becomes div B = mu_0 rho_m. Let\'s check the units. mu_0 is in H/m = T·m/A. rho_m is Wb/m³. Hmm, so mu_0 * rho_m is (T·m/A) * (Wb/m³) = (kg/(s²·A) * m/A) * (kg·m²/(s²·A))/m³) ??? Wait, Wb is T·m² = (kg/(s²·A))·m². So:\n\nmu_0 has units kg·m/(s²·A²)\nrho_m has units kg·m²/(s²·A·m³) = kg/(s²·A·m)\n\nThen mu_0 * rho_m = (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (kg/(s²·A·m)) = kg²/(s^4·A^3). But div B has units of kg/(s²·A·m), which doesn\'t match. So that can\'t be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe div B = rho_m / mu_0. Let\'s check:\n\nrho_m / mu_0 has units (kg/(s²·A·m)) / (kg·m/(s²·A²))) ) = (kg/(s²·A·m)) * (s²·A²)/(kg·m)) ) = A/m². But div B is kg/(s²·A·m), so that doesn\'t match either.\n\nHmm. Maybe I\'m overcomplicating. A straightforward way is to assume that the magnetic charge density rho_m enters Gauss\'s Law for B similarly to how rho_e enters Gauss\'s Law for E, but scaled by mu_0 instead of epsilon_0. However, from a dimensional perspective, it\'s tricky. But considering that in Gaussian units, it\'s symmetric with 4 pi rho_m. Since SI units have different scaling, perhaps we can just state that div B = mu_0 rho_m, analogous to div E = rho_e / epsilon_0.\n\nWait, if div E = rho_e / epsilon_0, then to get units of E (V/m) on the left, which is equivalent to (kg·m)/(s³·A). The right-hand side, rho_e / epsilon_0 is (C/m³)/(C²·s²/(kg·m³)) ) = kg/(s²·C·m). Hmm, the units aren\'t immediately obvious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the divergence equations in SI units with monopoles would need to introduce a magnetic permittivity or something, but generally, the consensus in physics when considering magnetic monopoles is to symmetrize Maxwell\'s equations by adding magnetic charge and current densities. The revised equations are:\n\ndiv E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\ndiv B = mu_0 rho_m\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m\n\ncurl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e\n\nBut I need to verify this. Let\'s check units for curl E. curl E has units of (V/m)/m = V/m². The right-hand side would be - dB/dt which is T/s, and - mu_0 J_m. Let\'s compute units:\n\nT/s is (kg/(s²·A))/s = kg/(s³·A)\n\nmu_0 is H/m = kg·m/(s²·A²)\n\nJ_m is magnetic current density, which if it is weber/(m²·s) = (kg·m²/(s²·A))/m²·s) = kg/(s³·A)\n\nThen mu_0 * J_m is (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (kg/(s³·A)) ) = kg²·m/(s^5·A^3). That doesn\'t match kg/(s³·A). So this doesn\'t resolve. So this is a problem. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the magnetic current term in Faraday\'s Law is (1/epsilon_0) J_m. Let\'s try that. Then:\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - (1/epsilon_0) J_m\n\nUnits of (1/epsilon_0) J_m: epsilon_0 has units C²·s²/(kg·m³). So 1/epsilon_0 is kg·m³/(C²·s²). J_m, if it\'s weber/(m²·s) = (T·m²)/(m²·s) = T/s, which is kg/(s³·A). Then (1/epsilon_0) J_m is kg·m³/(C²·s²) * kg/(s³·A) ) = kg²·m³/(C²·s^5·A). That\'s still not matching dB/dt, which is kg/(s³·A). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if J_m is in ampere per square meter (A/m²), same as electric current density, but that doesn\'t make sense because magnetic current should be related to movement of magnetic charges. If magnetic charge density rho_m is in weber per cubic meter (Wb/m³), then J_m would be (Wb/m³) * velocity, so (Wb/m³)*(m/s) = Wb/(m²·s). So I think that J_m should indeed be in Wb/(m²·s). \n\nPerhaps the issue is that there\'s a different constant involved. Let me refer back to the standard form when magnetic monopoles are introduced. According to some references, in SI units, Maxwell\'s equations with magnetic monopoles are:\n\ndiv E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\ndiv B = rho_m\n\ncurl E = - partial B / partial t - J_m\n\ncurl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e\n\nBut how? Let me check the units for div B = rho_m. As before, div B is in T/m, rho_m is Wb/m³. Since 1 T = 1 Wb/m², so T/m = Wb/m³, which is the same as rho_m. Therefore, div B = rho_m is dimensionally consistent in SI units only if rho_m is in Wb/m³. Then, in that case, the units work out. So that\'s possible.\n\nFor Faraday\'s Law: curl E = - dB/dt - J_m\n\ndB/dt is in T/s, and J_m is Wb/(m²·s). As T = Wb/m², so J_m is T/s. Therefore dB/dt is in T/s, J_m is in T/s. So the equation curl E = - dB/dt - J_m is adding terms with the same units. So yes, that works.\n\nBut in this case, J_m is a magnetic current density. In this formulation, the units work. So then, how does that relate to constants? So if we don\'t introduce any additional constants except for symmetry, we can have:\n\ndiv E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\ndiv B = rho_m\n\ncurl E = - partial B / partial t - J_m\n\ncurl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e\n\nBut then, if you compare to our original Ampère\'s Law, which is curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e. So that one doesn\'t change. Then only the Gauss\'s Law for magnetism and Faraday\'s Law change. But wait, in this case, the units for Faraday\'s Law are:\n\ncurl E is V/m² = (N/C)/m = (kg·m/s²/C)/m = kg/(s²·C·m). On the right-hand side, - dB/dt is T/s = (kg/(s²·A))/s = kg/(s³·A). J_m is Wb/(m²·s) = T·m²/(m²·s) = T/s = kg/(s³·A). Therefore both terms on the right have the same units. The left-hand side has units kg/(s²·C·m). The right-hand side units are kg/(s³·A). To make them match, we need (kg/(s³·A)) = (kg/(s²·C·m)). So 1/(s·A) = 1/(C·m). Since C = A·s, then 1/(s·A) = 1/(A·s·m) ) => 1/m = 1/(A·s·m) * s·A ), which is 1/m = 1/m. So that actually holds. Therefore, the units are consistent. \n\nWait, that is mind-blowing. How does that happen? Because 1 C = 1 A·s, so 1/(C·m) = 1/(A·s·m). Then, kg/(s²·C·m) = kg/(s²·A·s·m²) = kg/(s³·A·m²). Wait, no, the previous steps: \n\nWait, wait, let\'s do this again. Left-hand side (curl E): units of E is N/C = (kg·m/s²)/C. Then curl E is (kg·m/s²)/C divided by meter, so kg/(s²·C·m). \n\nRight-hand side: - dB/dt is kg/(s³·A) and - J_m is kg/(s³·A). So the total RHS is kg/(s³·A). \n\nTherefore, to reconcile LHS kg/(s²·C·m) = RHS kg/(s³·A). So this requires that 1/(s²·C·m) = 1/(s³·A), hence:\n\n1/(C·m) = 1/(s·A)\n\nBut C = A·s, so 1/(A·s·m) = 1/(s·A). Which implies 1/m = 1. Which can\'t be right. So there\'s an inconsistency here. Therefore, even though the dimensional analysis seemed to work earlier, in reality, there must be some missing constant. \n\nThis suggests that simply setting div B = rho_m and adding J_m to Faraday\'s Law as is without a constant factor makes the units inconsistent. Thus, we need to introduce a constant in front of J_m. This is similar to how Ampère\'s Law has mu_0 in front of J_e.\n\nGiven that, then perhaps the correct way is:\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m\n\nLet\'s check that. Then units of mu_0 J_m:\n\nmu_0 has units kg·m/(s²·A²), J_m is Wb/(m²·s) = (kg·m²/(s²·A))/m²·s = kg/(s³·A). Therefore, mu_0 J_m has (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (kg/(s³·A)) ) = kg²·m/(s^5·A^3). Which still doesn\'t match dB/dt (kg/(s³·A)). So even with mu_0, units don\'t match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it\'s 1/epsilon_0. \n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - (1/epsilon_0) J_m\n\nThen (1/epsilon_0) * J_m:\n\n1/epsilon_0 has units (kg·m³)/(C²·s²). J_m is Wb/(m²·s) = (kg·m²/(s²·A))/m²·s = kg/(s³·A). Multiplying them gives (kg·m³/(C²·s²)) * (kg/(s³·A)) = kg²·m³/(C²·s^5·A). Doesn\'t match. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different magnetic permeability? Say we have a magnetic permittivity mu_0 and an electric permittivity epsilon_0. Maybe the equations are symmetric with 1/c^2 terms, since c^2 = 1/(mu_0 epsilon_0).\n\nAlternatively, to make the units work, we need:\n\n[curl E] = [dB/dt] + [J_m]\n\nBut [curl E] is kg/(s²·C·m). [dB/dt] is kg/(s³·A). So we need [J_m] to be in kg/(s²·C·m) - kg/(s³·A). Wait, but this is messy. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps introducing a conversion factor. Let me take a different approach. The force on a magnetic charge would be F = q_m B, analogous to F = q_e E. This would mean that the units of magnetic charge q_m must be in weber (since B is in tesla, and tesla is weber per square meter). So 1 weber is 1 T·m². Force is in newtons, so:\n\nq_m B = N => q_m (Wb/m²) = kg·m/s². So q_m (Wb) = kg·m^3/s². Therefore, 1 Wb = kg·m²/s²·A, since T = kg/(s²·A). So indeed, Wb = T·m² = (kg/(s²·A))·m² = kg·m²/(s²·A).\n\nThen, rho_m (magnetic charge density) is Wb/m³ = kg/(s²·A·m). \n\nSimilarly, J_m (magnetic current density) would be Wb/(m²·s) = (kg/(s²·A·m))·(m/s), since current density is charge density times velocity. Therefore, J_m is rho_m * velocity = (kg/(s²·A·m)) * (m/s) = kg/(s³·A).\n\nSo J_m has units kg/(s³·A).\n\nLooking back at Faraday\'s Law:\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - (some constant) * J_m\n\nWe need the RHS to have units of T/s, which is kg/(s³·A). \n\n- dB/dt is already kg/(s³·A).\n\n- The term with J_m must also have units kg/(s³·A). Therefore, the constant multiplying J_m must be dimensionless? If so, but constants in physics usually aren\'t dimensionless in SI units. \n\nWait, but how else can this be? If the term is simply J_m, then it\'s T/s, same as dB/dt. Hence, in that case, the units work out. Therefore, perhaps we can write curl E = - dB/dt - J_m, with J_m having units T/s. But if J_m is in Wb/(m²·s), which is (T·m²)/(m²·s) = T/s, that works! Therefore, J_m is T/s. \n\nBut if that\'s the case, then the equation curl E = - dB/dt - J_m makes sense in units. The left-hand side, curl E, has units of T/s (since E is V/m, and curl E is V/m²; V is J/C, J is kg·m²/s², C is A·s; so V/m² = (kg·m²/(s²·A·s))/m²) = kg/(s³·A). Similarly, T/s is (kg/(s²·A))/s = kg/(s³·A). Therefore, curl E, dB/dt, and J_m all have the same units. Therefore, the equation is dimensionally consistent without any constants. Therefore, only a minus sign. Therefore, Faraday\'s Law becomes:\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - J_m\n\nBut how does that align with the existing Maxwell\'s equations? Originally, Faraday\'s Law is curl E = - dB/dt. So, the addition of a -J_m term in the presence of magnetic current. So if magnetic monopoles exist, then not only do we have a divergence of B being non-zero (Gauss\'s Law for magnetism becomes div B = rho_m), but also moving magnetic charges (magnetic current J_m) would add an extra term in Faraday\'s Law.\n\nSimilarly, Ampère\'s Law originally includes the electric current J_e. In the original Maxwell\'s equations, Ampère\'s Law is curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps there\'s a symmetry here as well, but in the question\'s context, only the presence of magnetic monopoles (static) would affect which equations? Or do we need to consider the dynamics as well?\n\nWait, the question says, "a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole", which is a static situation. However, the act of moving a magnetic pole would create a magnetic current, but Maxwell\'s equations in general account for dynamics. So to fully incorporate magnetic monopoles, both static and dynamic terms are needed, hence both Gauss\'s Law for magnetism and Faraday\'s Law would change. Whereas if only static monopoles are considered, maybe only Gauss\'s Law changes. But according to the problem statement, it says "where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole"—so the existence itself implies that divergence of B is non-zero. Therefore, Gauss\'s Law for magnetism (div B = 0) is modified. However, consistency with Maxwell\'s equations then also requires that when magnetic charges move (i.e., there are magnetic currents), Faraday\'s Law must include a term for that current. But if the universe allows for isolated poles, does it necessarily have to include the dynamics (i.e., the currents)? Probably, because otherwise the continuity equation for magnetic charge would be violated. \n\nThe continuity equation for electric charge is divergence J_e + drho_e/dt = 0. For magnetic charge, it should be divergence J_m + drho_m/dt = 0. \n\nIf we take the divergence of Faraday\'s Law in the modified case:\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - J_m\n\nTake the divergence of both sides: div(curl E) = 0 = - div(dB/dt) - div J_m\n\nSo 0 = - d/dt div B - div J_m => div J_m + d rho_m / dt = 0, which is the continuity equation. So this requires that the Faraday\'s Law has the J_m term. Therefore, to maintain conservation of magnetic charge, the J_m term must be included, which means Faraday\'s Law changes.\n\nTherefore, in this parallel universe with isolated magnetic poles (and therefore magnetic charge density rho_m and current density J_m), two of Maxwell\'s equations change: Gauss\'s Law for magnetism becomes div B = rho_m (or scaled by a constant) and Faraday\'s Law of induction gains a term involving the magnetic current density J_m. The other two equations, Gauss\'s Law for electricity and Ampère\'s Law, remain the same as in our universe. \n\nHowever, in the standard Maxwell\'s equations, Ampère\'s Law includes the displacement current term epsilon_0 dE/dt. If magnetic monopoles exist, would there be any need to modify Ampère\'s Law? Unless there is a need to introduce a magnetic displacement current, but that might not be necessary. Or perhaps, when considering duality transformations, you also have to modify Ampère\'s Law similarly, but in reality, since Ampère\'s Law deals with electric currents and the displacement current (time-varying E field), and unless there is a magnetic current affecting the H field, I think Ampère\'s Law remains intact.\n\nBut wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell\'s equations are generalized to be symmetric. So Ampère\'s Law would still involve only the electric current and displacement current, while Faraday\'s Law involves the magnetic current and the time derivative of B. So only Gauss\'s Law for magnetism and Faraday\'s Law are modified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that Gauss\'s Law for magnetism and Faraday\'s Law are different in this parallel universe. \n\nIn our universe:\n\n1. Gauss\'s Law: div E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\n2. Gauss\'s Law for magnetism: div B = 0\n\n3. Faraday\'s Law: curl E = - dB/dt\n\n4. Ampère\'s Law: curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e\n\nIn the parallel universe:\n\n1. Gauss\'s Law: same\n\n2. Gauss\'s Law for magnetism: div B = mu_0 rho_m (or another constant)\n\n3. Faraday\'s Law: curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m\n\n4. Ampère\'s Law: same\n\nBut the exact form with constants might vary. For example, some formulations might set magnetic charge in analogy with electric charge, so div B = rho_m / mu_0? Wait, in Gauss\'s Law, div E = rho_e / epsilon_0, so if we mirror it, div B = rho_m / mu_0. Let\'s test units then.\n\nrho_m is Wb/m³. div B is T/m. T = Wb/m², so div B is Wb/m³. So Wb/m³ = div B = rho_m / mu_0. So rho_m would have to have units of Wb/m³ * mu_0. But mu_0 is H/m = Wb/(A·m). So rho_m / mu_0 has units (Wb/m³) / (Wb/(A·m)) ) = A/m².\n\nWait, that\'s not matching. Then perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s mu_0 rho_m. div B = mu_0 rho_m. Then, rho_m is Wb/m³; mu_0 is H/m = Wb/(A·m). So mu_0 * rho_m is (Wb/(A·m)) * (Wb/m³) ) = Wb²/(A·m^4). But div B is Wb/m³. Not matching.\n\nTherefore, perhaps in SI units, unless we redefine the units for magnetic charge, the equations won\'t align. Therefore, many physicists use Gaussian units when discussing magnetic monopoles because the symmetry is clearer. In Gaussian units, Maxwell\'s equations with monopoles are:\n\ndiv E = 4π rho_e\n\ndiv B = 4π rho_m\n\ncurl E = - (1/c) ∂B/∂t - (4π/c) J_m\n\ncurl B = (1/c) ∂E/∂t + (4π/c) J_e\n\nIn this case, they look symmetric, and all constants are in the equations. So in SI units, to maintain this symmetry, we need scaling factors. \n\nConverting them to SI units complicates things, but generally, the equations that change are Gauss\'s Law for magnetism and Faraday\'s Law. So the answer is that the Gauss\'s Law for magnetism (div B = 0 becomes div B = mu_0 rho_m) and Faraday\'s Law (curl E = -dB/dt becomes curl E = -dB/dt - mu_0 J_m). \n\nSome sources say that in SI units, the modified equations are:\n\ndiv E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\ndiv B = rho_m\n\ncurl E = -∂B/∂t - J_m\n\ncurl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 ∂E/∂t + mu_0 J_e\n\nBut that causes issues with units unless J_m is in the same units as dB/dt, which if you accept that magnetic current density is in T/s, then it\'s okay. Alternatively, considering that current densities have units of charge per area per time, so for magnetic charges, it\'s webers per area per second (Wb/(m²·s)), which is equivalent to tesla per second (T/s), since 1 Wb/m² = 1 T. Therefore, J_m in T/s and dB/dt in T/s, so they can be added. \n\nTherefore, assuming the question is about which equations change, the correct answer is Gauss\'s Law for magnetism and Faraday\'s Law. \n\nHence, in this parallel universe, Maxwell’s equations that are different are Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law. Specifically:\n\n1. Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇ · B = μ₀ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.\n\n2. Faraday’s law of induction becomes ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current density.\n\nThese are the two equations that differ from our universe’s Maxwell equations. The other two equations, Gauss’s law for electric fields and Ampère’s circuital law (with Maxwell’s addition), remain the same.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe modified Maxwell equations in this universe are Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

In a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell’s equations differ from those in our universe. Specifically, the presence of isolated magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles) and magnetic currents alters two of Maxwell's equations:

1. **Gauss’s Law for Magnetism**: In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero (∇ · B = 0) because there are no magnetic monopoles. However, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, this equation becomes ∇ · B = μ₀ρₘ, where ρₘ is the magnetic charge density.

2. **Faraday’s Law of Induction**: In our universe, Faraday’s Law is ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t. However, with magnetic currents (resulting from moving magnetic monopoles), this equation includes an additional term for the magnetic current density Jₘ, becoming ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀Jₘ.

The other two Maxwell equations, Gauss’s Law for electric fields and Ampère’s Circuital Law (with Maxwell’s addition), remain unchanged in form.

### Final Answer
The modified Maxwell equations in this universe are Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law. Thus, the equations that are different are:
\boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m}
and
\boxed{\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

d to add terms for magnetic charge and current. So the four modified Maxwell equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = mu_0 rho_m
3. curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

Wait, but in the standard Ampère's Law, the displacement current is the derivative of E. If there's a magnetic current, does it add a term to Faraday's Law? Yes, I think so. In the absence of magnetic charges, Faraday's Law is just curl E = - dB/dt, but with magnetic current J_m, maybe there's a term proportional to J_m. Similarly, Ampère's Law would stay the same if there's no magnetic current. 

But actually, if magnetic charges exist, then moving magnetic charges would produce a magnetic current, analogous to how moving electric charges produce electric current. This would mean that Faraday's Law, which in our universe only has the time derivative term, would also include a term from the magnetic current. So the modified Faraday's Law would be curl E = - dB/dt - J_m, or something like that. Similarly, Ampère's Law would need to account for displacement current and the electric current.

To get the units right, the terms have to be adjusted with constants. Let's think. In SI units, Maxwell's equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0
3. curl E = - dB/dt
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

If monopoles exist, divergence of B is proportional to rho_m. Assume that similar to Gauss's law, div B = mu_0 rho_m? Or maybe another constant? Wait, in E, the divergence is rho_e / epsilon_0, so maybe symmetry would require that divergence of B is rho_m / something. Alternatively, if magnetic charge is measured in webers or some other unit, the constants may differ.

But actually, when we introduce magnetic charge, typically in theoretical physics, they would write the equations in a symmetric way. Let me recall. The standard approach when introducing magnetic monopoles is to have:

div E = 4 pi rho_e (in Gaussian units)
div B = 4 pi rho_m
curl E = - (1/c) dB/dt - (4 pi / c) J_m
curl B = (1/c) dE/dt + (4 pi / c) J_e

But SI units complicate things. However, in SI units, Maxwell's equations with monopoles usually have:

div D = rho_e
div B = rho_m
curl E = - dB/dt - J_m
curl H = dD/dt + J_e

But this assumes that the constitutive relations are D = epsilon_0 E + P and B = mu_0 (H + M). Hmm, perhaps this is getting too into the weeds. Let me focus on the question: which equations change.

In our universe, the equations are:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (Gauss's Law)
2. div B = 0 (Gauss's Law for magnetism)
3. curl E = - partial B / partial t (Faraday's Law)
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e (Ampère's Law)

So, if there are magnetic monopoles, then equation 2 must change from div B = 0 to div B = something, maybe mu_0 rho_m, similar to how equation 1 is. Then, if magnetic charges can move, that would create a magnetic current, so the Faraday's Law, which relates curl E to -dB/dt, might also get a term related to the magnetic current. So equation 3 would become curl E = - partial B / partial t - mu_0 J_m, perhaps.

But I need to check the units. For Faraday's Law in SI units, the units of curl E are V/m/m = T/s (since E is V/m, curl E is per meter, so V/m^2, and dB/dt is T/s. Since 1 T = 1 kg/(s^2·A), then dB/dt has units kg/(s^3·A). Similarly, the right-hand side of Faraday's law has units of T/s. If J_m is a magnetic current density, then its units would be weber/(m²·s) or something. Hmm. Let's think. Electric current density J_e is A/m² = C/(s·m²). Magnetic charge density rho_m would have units of weber/m³, so magnetic current density J_m would be weber/(m²·s) or equivalently (T·m²)/(m²·s) = T/s. Wait, but in Faraday's law, the term is -dB/dt, which is T/s, so if J_m is in T/s, then it would match. But in the equation, we have:

curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m

If J_m is in weber/(m²·s), then multiplying by mu_0 (which has units of H/m = T·m/A) would give mu_0 * J_m has units (T·m/A) * (Wb/(m²·s)). Since Wb is T·m², so (T·m/A) * (T·m²)/(m²·s)) = (T²·m)/(A·s). Wait, but dB/dt is T/s. These units don't match. Hmm, maybe there's a different constant?

Alternatively, perhaps the magnetic charge is measured in ampere-meters (A·m), similar to how electric charge is in coulombs (C = A·s). So rho_m would be A·m/m³ = A/m², which is the same as current density. Wait, that might not be right. 

This is getting confusing. Let's approach it more carefully. In SI units, the units for magnetic charge (if it exists) would likely be webers (Wb), since magnetic flux is measured in webers, and if you have a magnetic monopole, its strength is measured in webers. Then, magnetic charge density rho_m is Wb/m³. 

Current density J_e is C/(m²·s) or A/m². Similarly, magnetic current density J_m would be Wb/(m²·s). 

Gauss's Law: div E = rho_e / epsilon_0. So E has units of V/m = (J/C)/m = (N·m/C)/m = (kg·m²/(s²·C))/m = kg·m/(s²·C). Div E is kg/(s²·C·m). rho_e is C/m³, so rho_e / epsilon_0 is (C/m³)/(C²·s²/(kg·m³)) ) = kg/(s²·C·m). Units match.

Similarly, if div B = rho_m / mu_0. B has units T = kg/(s²·A). Div B is kg/(s²·A·m). rho_m is Wb/m³ = (kg·m²/(s²·A))/m³ = kg/(s²·A·m²). Then rho_m / mu_0 would be (kg/(s²·A·m²)) / (kg·m/(s²·A²))) = A/m. Wait, that's not the same as div B's units. Hmm, so maybe div B = mu_0 rho_m?

mu_0 is kg·m/(s²·A²). So mu_0 rho_m is (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (kg/(s²·A·m²))) = kg²/(s^4·A³·m). Not matching div B. This suggests that perhaps there is another constant involved. Alternatively, maybe in SI units, the equations with monopoles are not as straightforward.

In the standard treatment when considering magnetic monopoles, people often use Gaussian units, where symmetry is more apparent. In Gaussian units, Maxwell's equations are:

div E = 4π rho_e
div B = 4π rho_m
curl E = -(1/c) ∂B/∂t - (4π/c) J_m
curl B = (1/c) ∂E/∂t + (4π/c) J_e

So in Gaussian units, the equations become symmetric with the addition of magnetic charge and current terms. Translating this into SI units might require scaling factors.

Alternatively, maybe in SI units, the modified equations are:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
div B = rho_m / epsilon_0  ??

Wait, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Let me think. If we want div B = rho_m / something, let's denote the magnetic charge density as rho_m with units of webers per cubic meter (Wb/m³), then the units of div B would be webers per meter cubed (Wb/m³) divided by something to get tesla per meter (since div B is in tesla per meter). Because B is in tesla (T), so div B is T/m. T is Wb/m², so div B is Wb/m³. So rho_m is also in Wb/m³. So if div B = rho_m, that would make the units consistent. So simply, div B = rho_m. But in that case, in SI units, what's the scaling? If that's the case, then the unit conversion is built into rho_m.

But how does this compare to electric flux? For electric fields, div E = rho_e / epsilon_0. The permittivity epsilon_0 is part of Gauss's Law. If we are adding magnetic charge, do we need a similar permittivity for magnetism? Wait, but the permeability mu_0 is already present in Ampère's Law.

Alternatively, in a symmetric formulation, it's possible that the equations would need factors of mu_0 and epsilon_0 to relate electric and magnetic quantities.

Alternatively, maybe the equation becomes div B = mu_0 rho_m. Let's check the units. mu_0 is in H/m = T·m/A. rho_m is Wb/m³. Hmm, so mu_0 * rho_m is (T·m/A) * (Wb/m³) = (kg/(s²·A) * m/A) * (kg·m²/(s²·A))/m³) ??? Wait, Wb is T·m² = (kg/(s²·A))·m². So:

mu_0 has units kg·m/(s²·A²)
rho_m has units kg·m²/(s²·A·m³) = kg/(s²·A·m)

Then mu_0 * rho_m = (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (kg/(s²·A·m)) = kg²/(s^4·A^3). But div B has units of kg/(s²·A·m), which doesn't match. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe div B = rho_m / mu_0. Let's check:

rho_m / mu_0 has units (kg/(s²·A·m)) / (kg·m/(s²·A²))) ) = (kg/(s²·A·m)) * (s²·A²)/(kg·m)) ) = A/m². But div B is kg/(s²·A·m), so that doesn't match either.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. A straightforward way is to assume that the magnetic charge density rho_m enters Gauss's Law for B similarly to how rho_e enters Gauss's Law for E, but scaled by mu_0 instead of epsilon_0. However, from a dimensional perspective, it's tricky. But considering that in Gaussian units, it's symmetric with 4 pi rho_m. Since SI units have different scaling, perhaps we can just state that div B = mu_0 rho_m, analogous to div E = rho_e / epsilon_0.

Wait, if div E = rho_e / epsilon_0, then to get units of E (V/m) on the left, which is equivalent to (kg·m)/(s³·A). The right-hand side, rho_e / epsilon_0 is (C/m³)/(C²·s²/(kg·m³)) ) = kg/(s²·C·m). Hmm, the units aren't immediately obvious. 

Alternatively, maybe the divergence equations in SI units with monopoles would need to introduce a magnetic permittivity or something, but generally, the consensus in physics when considering magnetic monopoles is to symmetrize Maxwell's equations by adding magnetic charge and current densities. The revised equations are:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = mu_0 rho_m

curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m

curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

But I need to verify this. Let's check units for curl E. curl E has units of (V/m)/m = V/m². The right-hand side would be - dB/dt which is T/s, and - mu_0 J_m. Let's compute units:

T/s is (kg/(s²·A))/s = kg/(s³·A)

mu_0 is H/m = kg·m/(s²·A²)

J_m is magnetic current density, which if it is weber/(m²·s) = (kg·m²/(s²·A))/m²·s) = kg/(s³·A)

Then mu_0 * J_m is (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (kg/(s³·A)) ) = kg²·m/(s^5·A^3). That doesn't match kg/(s³·A). So this doesn't resolve. So this is a problem. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the magnetic current term in Faraday's Law is (1/epsilon_0) J_m. Let's try that. Then:

curl E = - dB/dt - (1/epsilon_0) J_m

Units of (1/epsilon_0) J_m: epsilon_0 has units C²·s²/(kg·m³). So 1/epsilon_0 is kg·m³/(C²·s²). J_m, if it's weber/(m²·s) = (T·m²)/(m²·s) = T/s, which is kg/(s³·A). Then (1/epsilon_0) J_m is kg·m³/(C²·s²) * kg/(s³·A) ) = kg²·m³/(C²·s^5·A). That's still not matching dB/dt, which is kg/(s³·A). Hmm.

Alternatively, if J_m is in ampere per square meter (A/m²), same as electric current density, but that doesn't make sense because magnetic current should be related to movement of magnetic charges. If magnetic charge density rho_m is in weber per cubic meter (Wb/m³), then J_m would be (Wb/m³) * velocity, so (Wb/m³)*(m/s) = Wb/(m²·s). So I think that J_m should indeed be in Wb/(m²·s). 

Perhaps the issue is that there's a different constant involved. Let me refer back to the standard form when magnetic monopoles are introduced. According to some references, in SI units, Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles are:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = rho_m

curl E = - partial B / partial t - J_m

curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e

But how? Let me check the units for div B = rho_m. As before, div B is in T/m, rho_m is Wb/m³. Since 1 T = 1 Wb/m², so T/m = Wb/m³, which is the same as rho_m. Therefore, div B = rho_m is dimensionally consistent in SI units only if rho_m is in Wb/m³. Then, in that case, the units work out. So that's possible.

For Faraday's Law: curl E = - dB/dt - J_m

dB/dt is in T/s, and J_m is Wb/(m²·s). As T = Wb/m², so J_m is T/s. Therefore dB/dt is in T/s, J_m is in T/s. So the equation curl E = - dB/dt - J_m is adding terms with the same units. So yes, that works.

But in this case, J_m is a magnetic current density. In this formulation, the units work. So then, how does that relate to constants? So if we don't introduce any additional constants except for symmetry, we can have:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = rho_m

curl E = - partial B / partial t - J_m

curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e

But then, if you compare to our original Ampère's Law, which is curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e. So that one doesn't change. Then only the Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law change. But wait, in this case, the units for Faraday's Law are:

curl E is V/m² = (N/C)/m = (kg·m/s²/C)/m = kg/(s²·C·m). On the right-hand side, - dB/dt is T/s = (kg/(s²·A))/s = kg/(s³·A). J_m is Wb/(m²·s) = T·m²/(m²·s) = T/s = kg/(s³·A). Therefore both terms on the right have the same units. The left-hand side has units kg/(s²·C·m). The right-hand side units are kg/(s³·A). To make them match, we need (kg/(s³·A)) = (kg/(s²·C·m)). So 1/(s·A) = 1/(C·m). Since C = A·s, then 1/(s·A) = 1/(A·s·m) ) => 1/m = 1/(A·s·m) * s·A ), which is 1/m = 1/m. So that actually holds. Therefore, the units are consistent. 

Wait, that is mind-blowing. How does that happen? Because 1 C = 1 A·s, so 1/(C·m) = 1/(A·s·m). Then, kg/(s²·C·m) = kg/(s²·A·s·m²) = kg/(s³·A·m²). Wait, no, the previous steps: 

Wait, wait, let's do this again. Left-hand side (curl E): units of E is N/C = (kg·m/s²)/C. Then curl E is (kg·m/s²)/C divided by meter, so kg/(s²·C·m). 

Right-hand side: - dB/dt is kg/(s³·A) and - J_m is kg/(s³·A). So the total RHS is kg/(s³·A). 

Therefore, to reconcile LHS kg/(s²·C·m) = RHS kg/(s³·A). So this requires that 1/(s²·C·m) = 1/(s³·A), hence:

1/(C·m) = 1/(s·A)

But C = A·s, so 1/(A·s·m) = 1/(s·A). Which implies 1/m = 1. Which can't be right. So there's an inconsistency here. Therefore, even though the dimensional analysis seemed to work earlier, in reality, there must be some missing constant. 

This suggests that simply setting div B = rho_m and adding J_m to Faraday's Law as is without a constant factor makes the units inconsistent. Thus, we need to introduce a constant in front of J_m. This is similar to how Ampère's Law has mu_0 in front of J_e.

Given that, then perhaps the correct way is:

curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m

Let's check that. Then units of mu_0 J_m:

mu_0 has units kg·m/(s²·A²), J_m is Wb/(m²·s) = (kg·m²/(s²·A))/m²·s = kg/(s³·A). Therefore, mu_0 J_m has (kg·m/(s²·A²)) * (kg/(s³·A)) ) = kg²·m/(s^5·A^3). Which still doesn't match dB/dt (kg/(s³·A)). So even with mu_0, units don't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's 1/epsilon_0. 

curl E = - dB/dt - (1/epsilon_0) J_m

Then (1/epsilon_0) * J_m:

1/epsilon_0 has units (kg·m³)/(C²·s²). J_m is Wb/(m²·s) = (kg·m²/(s²·A))/m²·s = kg/(s³·A). Multiplying them gives (kg·m³/(C²·s²)) * (kg/(s³·A)) = kg²·m³/(C²·s^5·A). Doesn't match. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different magnetic permeability? Say we have a magnetic permittivity mu_0 and an electric permittivity epsilon_0. Maybe the equations are symmetric with 1/c^2 terms, since c^2 = 1/(mu_0 epsilon_0).

Alternatively, to make the units work, we need:

[curl E] = [dB/dt] + [J_m]

But [curl E] is kg/(s²·C·m). [dB/dt] is kg/(s³·A). So we need [J_m] to be in kg/(s²·C·m) - kg/(s³·A). Wait, but this is messy. 

Alternatively, perhaps introducing a conversion factor. Let me take a different approach. The force on a magnetic charge would be F = q_m B, analogous to F = q_e E. This would mean that the units of magnetic charge q_m must be in weber (since B is in tesla, and tesla is weber per square meter). So 1 weber is 1 T·m². Force is in newtons, so:

q_m B = N => q_m (Wb/m²) = kg·m/s². So q_m (Wb) = kg·m^3/s². Therefore, 1 Wb = kg·m²/s²·A, since T = kg/(s²·A). So indeed, Wb = T·m² = (kg/(s²·A))·m² = kg·m²/(s²·A).

Then, rho_m (magnetic charge density) is Wb/m³ = kg/(s²·A·m). 

Similarly, J_m (magnetic current density) would be Wb/(m²·s) = (kg/(s²·A·m))·(m/s), since current density is charge density times velocity. Therefore, J_m is rho_m * velocity = (kg/(s²·A·m)) * (m/s) = kg/(s³·A).

So J_m has units kg/(s³·A).

Looking back at Faraday's Law:

curl E = - dB/dt - (some constant) * J_m

We need the RHS to have units of T/s, which is kg/(s³·A). 

- dB/dt is already kg/(s³·A).

- The term with J_m must also have units kg/(s³·A). Therefore, the constant multiplying J_m must be dimensionless? If so, but constants in physics usually aren't dimensionless in SI units. 

Wait, but how else can this be? If the term is simply J_m, then it's T/s, same as dB/dt. Hence, in that case, the units work out. Therefore, perhaps we can write curl E = - dB/dt - J_m, with J_m having units T/s. But if J_m is in Wb/(m²·s), which is (T·m²)/(m²·s) = T/s, that works! Therefore, J_m is T/s. 

But if that's the case, then the equation curl E = - dB/dt - J_m makes sense in units. The left-hand side, curl E, has units of T/s (since E is V/m, and curl E is V/m²; V is J/C, J is kg·m²/s², C is A·s; so V/m² = (kg·m²/(s²·A·s))/m²) = kg/(s³·A). Similarly, T/s is (kg/(s²·A))/s = kg/(s³·A). Therefore, curl E, dB/dt, and J_m all have the same units. Therefore, the equation is dimensionally consistent without any constants. Therefore, only a minus sign. Therefore, Faraday's Law becomes:

curl E = - dB/dt - J_m

But how does that align with the existing Maxwell's equations? Originally, Faraday's Law is curl E = - dB/dt. So, the addition of a -J_m term in the presence of magnetic current. So if magnetic monopoles exist, then not only do we have a divergence of B being non-zero (Gauss's Law for magnetism becomes div B = rho_m), but also moving magnetic charges (magnetic current J_m) would add an extra term in Faraday's Law.

Similarly, Ampère's Law originally includes the electric current J_e. In the original Maxwell's equations, Ampère's Law is curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps there's a symmetry here as well, but in the question's context, only the presence of magnetic monopoles (static) would affect which equations? Or do we need to consider the dynamics as well?

Wait, the question says, "a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole", which is a static situation. However, the act of moving a magnetic pole would create a magnetic current, but Maxwell's equations in general account for dynamics. So to fully incorporate magnetic monopoles, both static and dynamic terms are needed, hence both Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law would change. Whereas if only static monopoles are considered, maybe only Gauss's Law changes. But according to the problem statement, it says "where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole"—so the existence itself implies that divergence of B is non-zero. Therefore, Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B = 0) is modified. However, consistency with Maxwell's equations then also requires that when magnetic charges move (i.e., there are magnetic currents), Faraday's Law must include a term for that current. But if the universe allows for isolated poles, does it necessarily have to include the dynamics (i.e., the currents)? Probably, because otherwise the continuity equation for magnetic charge would be violated. 

The continuity equation for electric charge is divergence J_e + drho_e/dt = 0. For magnetic charge, it should be divergence J_m + drho_m/dt = 0. 

If we take the divergence of Faraday's Law in the modified case:

curl E = - dB/dt - J_m

Take the divergence of both sides: div(curl E) = 0 = - div(dB/dt) - div J_m

So 0 = - d/dt div B - div J_m => div J_m + d rho_m / dt = 0, which is the continuity equation. So this requires that the Faraday's Law has the J_m term. Therefore, to maintain conservation of magnetic charge, the J_m term must be included, which means Faraday's Law changes.

Therefore, in this parallel universe with isolated magnetic poles (and therefore magnetic charge density rho_m and current density J_m), two of Maxwell's equations change: Gauss's Law for magnetism becomes div B = rho_m (or scaled by a constant) and Faraday's Law of induction gains a term involving the magnetic current density J_m. The other two equations, Gauss's Law for electricity and Ampère's Law, remain the same as in our universe. 

However, in the standard Maxwell's equations, Ampère's Law includes the displacement current term epsilon_0 dE/dt. If magnetic monopoles exist, would there be any need to modify Ampère's Law? Unless there is a need to introduce a magnetic displacement current, but that might not be necessary. Or perhaps, when considering duality transformations, you also have to modify Ampère's Law similarly, but in reality, since Ampère's Law deals with electric currents and the displacement current (time-varying E field), and unless there is a magnetic current affecting the H field, I think Ampère's Law remains intact.

But wait, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations are generalized to be symmetric. So Ampère's Law would still involve only the electric current and displacement current, while Faraday's Law involves the magnetic current and the time derivative of B. So only Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are modified. 

Therefore, the answer is that Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are different in this parallel universe. 

In our universe:

1. Gauss's Law: div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: div B = 0

3. Faraday's Law: curl E = - dB/dt

4. Ampère's Law: curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

In the parallel universe:

1. Gauss's Law: same

2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: div B = mu_0 rho_m (or another constant)

3. Faraday's Law: curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m

4. Ampère's Law: same

But the exact form with constants might vary. For example, some formulations might set magnetic charge in analogy with electric charge, so div B = rho_m / mu_0? Wait, in Gauss's Law, div E = rho_e / epsilon_0, so if we mirror it, div B = rho_m / mu_0. Let's test units then.

rho_m is Wb/m³. div B is T/m. T = Wb/m², so div B is Wb/m³. So Wb/m³ = div B = rho_m / mu_0. So rho_m would have to have units of Wb/m³ * mu_0. But mu_0 is H/m = Wb/(A·m). So rho_m / mu_0 has units (Wb/m³) / (Wb/(A·m)) ) = A/m².

Wait, that's not matching. Then perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps it's mu_0 rho_m. div B = mu_0 rho_m. Then, rho_m is Wb/m³; mu_0 is H/m = Wb/(A·m). So mu_0 * rho_m is (Wb/(A·m)) * (Wb/m³) ) = Wb²/(A·m^4). But div B is Wb/m³. Not matching.

Therefore, perhaps in SI units, unless we redefine the units for magnetic charge, the equations won't align. Therefore, many physicists use Gaussian units when discussing magnetic monopoles because the symmetry is clearer. In Gaussian units, Maxwell's equations with monopoles are:

div E = 4π rho_e

div B = 4π rho_m

curl E = - (1/c) ∂B/∂t - (4π/c) J_m

curl B = (1/c) ∂E/∂t + (4π/c) J_e

In this case, they look symmetric, and all constants are in the equations. So in SI units, to maintain this symmetry, we need scaling factors. 

Converting them to SI units complicates things, but generally, the equations that change are Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law. So the answer is that the Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B = 0 becomes div B = mu_0 rho_m) and Faraday's Law (curl E = -dB/dt becomes curl E = -dB/dt - mu_0 J_m). 

Some sources say that in SI units, the modified equations are:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = rho_m

curl E = -∂B/∂t - J_m

curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 ∂E/∂t + mu_0 J_e

But that causes issues with units unless J_m is in the same units as dB/dt, which if you accept that magnetic current density is in T/s, then it's okay. Alternatively, considering that current densities have units of charge per area per time, so for magnetic charges, it's webers per area per second (Wb/(m²·s)), which is equivalent to tesla per second (T/s), since 1 Wb/m² = 1 T. Therefore, J_m in T/s and dB/dt in T/s, so they can be added. 

Therefore, assuming the question is about which equations change, the correct answer is Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law. 

Hence, in this parallel universe, Maxwell’s equations that are different are Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law. Specifically:

1. Gauss’s law for magnetism becomes ∇ · B = μ₀ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.

2. Faraday’s law of induction becomes ∇ × E = -∂B/∂t - μ₀J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current density.

These are the two equations that differ from our universe’s Maxwell equations. The other two equations, Gauss’s law for electric fields and Ampère’s circuital law (with Maxwell’s addition), remain the same.


**Final Answer**
The modified Maxwell equations in this universe are Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law. Thus, the equations that are different are \boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m} and \boxed{\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

In a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations become symmetrized to account for both electric and magnetic charges and currents. Specifically, two of the four equations are modified:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: The original equation, ∇·B = 0 (no magnetic monopoles), gains a magnetic charge density term (ρₘ):  
   **∇·B = μ₀ρₘ**.

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: To include magnetic current density (Jₘ), the equation becomes:  
   **∇×E = −∂B/∂t − μ₀Jₘ**.

The other two equations—**Gauss's Law for Electricity** (∇·E = ρₑ/ε₀) and **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition** (∇×B = μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t + μ₀Jₑ)—remain unchanged in form, as they already account for electric charges and currents. Thus, the presence of magnetic monopoles modifies **Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law**.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

So all four equations might get modified? Wait, but in reality, do only two of them change?

Let me check. If magnetic charges and currents exist, then:

1. Gauss's Law: div E = rho_e / epsilon_0 (unchanged, because electric charges still exist)
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: div B = mu_0 * rho_m (instead of 0)
3. Faraday's Law: curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 * J_m (if there's a magnetic current)
4. Ampère's Law: curl B = mu_0 * epsilon_0 * dE/dt + mu_0 * J_e (unchanged if only electric current)

Wait, so introducing magnetic charge density would modify Gauss's Law for magnetism, and magnetic current would add a term to Faraday's Law.

Thus, the modified Maxwell equations would be:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = mu_0 * rho_m
3. curl E = - (partial B / partial t) - mu_0 * J_m
4. curl B = mu_0 * epsilon_0 * (partial E / partial t) + mu_0 * J_e

Additionally, there would be a continuity equation for magnetic charges, similar to electric charges: div J_m + partial rho_m / partial t = 0.

So out of the original four Maxwell equations, two of them would change: Gauss's Law for magnetism (equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3). Ampère's Law (equation 4) remains the same if we suppose that electric currents are still only those due to electric charges. Wait, but isn't there a symmetry? In the standard setup, Ampère's Law includes the displacement current and electric current. If we have magnetic currents, would Faraday's Law pick up a term related to that, and Ampère's Law stay as it is?

Alternatively, maybe Ampère's Law shouldn't be changed because magnetic current would be part of Faraday's Law, not Ampère's. Let's confirm with what I know.

In standard electromagnetism without monopoles, the equations are:

1. div E = rho / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0
3. curl E = - dB/dt
4. curl B = mu_0 J + mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt

But when magnetic monopoles are introduced, the symmetrized Maxwell equations become:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = mu_0 rho_m
3. curl E = - dB/dt - mu_0 J_m
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

So yes, two equations are modified: Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. Ampère's Law remains as it was except for possible magnetic current, but no—since Ampère-Circuit is only for electric current. The Maxwell–Ampère Law includes electric current plus displacement current regardless of magnetic charges. Therefore, with magnetic charges, only the Ampère's Law remains the same, and Faraday gets an extra term. But, according to standard treatments, when you introduce magnetic monopoles, symmetry is achieved by adding to Faraday's Law and modifying Gauss's magnetism.

Thus, in this modified universe with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell’s equations would have changes in Gauss’s law for magnetism (now with a magnetic charge density term) and Faraday’s law of induction (now including a magnetic current density term). So that's two equations altered, which are the second and third equations. Then the answer would be that Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law are different.

Let's see.\n\nIn the original equations, B has units of Tesla, E in V/m. Charge densities and current densities have their respective units.\n\nIf we have a magnetic charge, perhaps the units would be in webers (Wb). But then to get units matched, the equation for div B = something with magnetic charge density. To keep compatibility, divergence would be in T/m, so if rho_m is in Wb/m²?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dimensions need to be re-examined.\n\nMoreover, when considering the duality transformation in electromagnetism, introducing magnetic charges would adjust the equations symmetrically. So, typically, if you have both electric and magnetic charges, Maxwell's equations take a more symmetric form, where each field has a divergence proportional to their charge density, and each curl is related to the time derivative of the other field plus the corresponding current.\n\nBut dimensionally, the constants in the equations (epsilon_0 and mu_0) would come into play to get the units right. For instance, in the Faraday Law modification, adding a term involving the magnetic current would require a factor to adjust the units appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, SI units can be a bit tricky here, perhaps Gaussian units might make the symmetry clearer? Let's think.\n\nIn Gaussian units, Maxwell's equations have factors of c (speed of light). However, SI might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, in a unit system where c=1, the symmetry becomes more apparent.\n\nBut perhaps in the standard SI system, modifying Maxwell's equations to include magnetic monopoles would adjust two equations: Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law. So div B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, and curl E would get a term proportional to the magnetic current.\n\nBut which equations?\n\nOriginal equations (SI units):\n1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n2. div B = 0\n3. curl E = - dB/dt\n4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e\n\nWith monopoles, equation 2 becomes div B = mu_0 rho_m or something. But wait, units of rho_e is C/m^3. What's the unit for magnetic charge?\n\nMaybe we need to decide what unit the magnetic charge would have. If we follow the Dirac quantization condition, where the product of electric and magnetic charges is a multiple of Planck's constant over 2π, but perhaps in terms of units, the magnetic charge would have units of weber (since magnetic flux is in webers, and a monopole would produce a flux proportional to its charge). So maybe rho_m is in Wb/m^3. Then div B, which has units of Tesla/m (since divergence is per meter), but Tesla = Wb/m², so Tesla/m is Wb/m³. So, the term div B would be rho_m (in Wb/m³), so equation 2 would be div B = rho_m, but Sigma's Units registered? But original equation for div E is in Coulomb per (epsilon_0 * m^3). Wait, no, in SI, Gauss's Law is div E = rho / epsilon_0. So E is (V/m), divergence of E is (V/m²). Meanwhile, rho is C/m^3, so (C/m^3)/epsilon_0 (C/(V m))) would give (V/m²). Okay, so units work out.\n\nIf we propose that equation 2 changes from div B = 0 to div B = mu_0 * rho_m, then the units would need rho_m to have units of (Tesla/m) / mu_0. But mu_0 is in H/m (henrys per meter) which is Tesla·m/A. So rho_m would have units (T/m) / (T·m/A) = A/m². That may not be ideal. Alternatively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the presence of magnetic monopoles, equation 2 will be div B = rho_m, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density. Then to make the units consistent, if rho_m is in weber/m^3, and since div B is in T/m (because B is T, divergence is 1/m, so in T/m). But Weber is T·m². So Weber/m³ is T·m²/m³ = T/m. So T/m (div B) on the left and rho_m (T/m) on the right, so unit-wise, consistent. Therefore, equation 2 becomes div B = rho_m. However, note that Maxwell's equations in SI have factors of mu_0 and epsilon_0, so this may complicate.\n\nWait, perhaps in that case the proper equation should have a scaling factor. Such as div B = mu_0 rho_m. If in original equations, equation 1 is div E = rho_e / epsilon_0. So when you have a magnetic charge density rho_m, if you want equation 2 to be similar, then div B = mu_0 rho_m. Let's check units.\n\nWhat is the unit of rho_e / epsilon_0?\n\nrho_e is in C/m³. epsilon_0 is in C²/(N·m²). Therefore, rho_e / epsilon_0 has units (C/m³)/ (C²/(N·m²)) ) = N·m²/(C·m³) = N/(C·m). Now, Newton is kg·m/s², C is A·s. Then whole unit is kg/(A·s³·m). Hmmm. How does that relate to E and div E? The divergence of E is in units of (V/m)/m = V/m². Since V is J/C = (kg·m²/s³)/A·s = kg·m²/(A·s⁴). So V/m² is kg/(A·s⁴·m). So to have consistency, (kg/(A·s³·m )) (something) should equal kg/(A·s⁴·m). Wait, maybe my units check is getting too convoluted here.\n\nAnother angle: in Gauss's Law for electric fields, div E = rho_e / epsilon_0.\n\nTo make Gauss's Law for magnetism similar, with magnetic charge density rho_m, we might have div B = mu_0 rho_m. Then, considering the units, rho_m would have the unit of magnetic charge per volume. Let's assume magnetic charge g (in Weber), so rho_m is Wb/m³. Div B is T/m. Since 1 Wb = T·m², so Wb/m³ is T/m². T/m² is different from T/m. Maybe even this needs adjusting; perhaps the units don't align. Alternatively, perhaps if we model the magnetic charge density as some term to make the units work. For example, if div B = rho_m * mu_0, then mu_0 is H/m (H is Wb/A). So H/m * rho_m in ??? Units. Let me compute.\n\nIf mu_0 has unit H/m (henry per meter). Henry is Wb/A. So mu_0 is Wb/(A·m). rho_m if it's in magnetic charge per volume, suppose unit is A·m (since for rho_e it's C/m³= A·s/m³). Magnetic charge could be Weber, which is V·s = T·m². So rho_m in Wb/m³. Then mu_0 * rho_m would be (Wb/(A·m))*(Wb/m³) = (Wb)^2/(A·m⁴). But div B is T/m = Wb/(m²·m) = Wb/m³. So if right-hand side here has units (Wb^2)/(A·m⁴), which is different from left-hand side's Wb/m³. That doesn't match. Therefore, the units don't match here.\n\nAlternatively, if the magnetic charge density's unit is (Wb/m³), then perhaps div B = rho_m / mu_0. Then mu_0 is H/m = Wb/(A·m). So (Wb/m³)/(Wb/(A·m)) = A·m/m³ = A/m². However, div B is in T/m = Wb/m³. So doesn't match.\n\nHmm, apparently, unit analysis isn't so straightforward here. Maybe there is a different convention. Let me refer to how electric charge and current are treated.\n\nAlternatively, if in another unit system, like Gaussian units, where Maxwell's equations are symmetric except for factors of c.\n\nWait, in Gaussian units, electric and magnetic fields have the same units. Gauss's Law is div E = 4π rho_e, Gauss's law for magnetism is div B = 4π rho_m, Faraday's Law is curl E = - (1/c) dB/dt - (4π/c) J_m, and Ampère's Law is curl B = (1/c) dE/dt + (4π/c) J_e.\n\nBut in SI units, it's a different story.\n\nAlternatively, going to the concept of duality transformation. In the presence of magnetic charge and current densities, Maxwell's equations become:\n\ndiv E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\ndiv B = mu_0 rho_m\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - J_m\n\ncurl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e\n\nBut how do the units play here?\n\nAlternatively, for Faraday's Law adding a term related to the magnetic current. Suppose instead Faraday's Law is:\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt - J_m some constant factor.\n\nBut the original Faraday's Law in SI is:\n\ncurl E = - dB/dt (units of dB/dt is T/s. Curl E is (V/m)/m = V/m². T/s is (Wb/m²)/s. Since Wb is V·s, so T/s is V·s/(m² s) = V/m². So yes, units align.\n\nIf we add a term J_m, which would be magnetic current density (unit ?). If J_e is electric current density (A/m² = C/(s·m²)).\n\nIf magnetic current density J_m is in Weber/(s·m²), since Weber is V·s, so J_m would be (V·s)/(s·m²) = V/m². Which is the same unit as the other terms in Faraday's Law. So then, Faraday's equation could have a term - J_m. But then, Ampère's Law would be: curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e, with dE/dt in (V/m)/s = V/(m·s) = (N·m/C)/m·s = (kg·m/(s³·A))/m·s )= kg/(s⁴·A). B's curl is (T/m)= (Wb/m²)/m. Wb is V·s, so T/m is V·s/m³. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, to make units match, maybe factors of mu_0 and epsilon_0 need to be incorporated into the additional terms in Faraday's and Ampère's Laws.\n\nAlternatively, according to some references, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations in SI units become:\n\n1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0\n\n2. div B = mu_0 rho_m\n\n3. curl E = - partial B / partial t - mu_0 J_m\n\n4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e\n\nSo in this case, equations 2 and 3 are modified. Let's verify the units here.\n\nFirst, equation 3: curl E has units V/m². The term -partial B/partial t is in T/s. To convert T to Weber/m², 1 T = 1 Wb/m². Therefore, T/s = Wb/(m² s) = V·s/(m² s) = V/m², which matches the units for curl E. Then, the term - mu_0 J_m. mu_0 is in H/m = Wb/(A·m). J_m is the magnetic current density, which is in Weber/(s·m²) (since magnetic charge is Weber, so current is Weber/s, and density is that per m²). So mu_0 * J_m has units (Wb/(A·m)) * (Wb/(s·m²)) ). Wb is V·s, so plugging that in: (V·s/(A·m)) * (V·s)/(s·m²)) = V²·s²/(A·m³ s) ). Let's simplify: V²·s/(A·m³ ). But V is J/C, J is N·m, N is kg·m/s². So V is (kg·m/s² · m )/(C ) since C is A·s. Therefore, V is (kg·m²)/(C·s²), and V squared is (kg²·m^4)/(C²·s^4). Therefore, the units of mu_0 J_m is ((kg²·m^4)/(C²·s^4 )) * s / (A·m³)) ). C is A·s, so substituting, we get (kg²·m^4)/( (A·s)²·s^4 ) * s / (A·m³ )) ). Let's compute exponents:\n\nNumerator: kg², m^4, s in the numerator from *s.\n\nDenominator: (A^2 s^2 * s^4) )* A m^3 = A^3 s^6 m^3.\n\nTherefore, kg² m^4 s / (A^3 s^6 m^3 ) ) = kg² m / (A^3 s^5 ). This seems complicated, but maybe not meaningful. Alternatively, since we know that mu_0 has units of H/m, and J_m has units of V/m², so H=Wb/A, V=Wb/s. So H/m is Wb/(A m) = V·s/(A m ). Therefore, mu_0 *(V/m²) is V·s/(A m ) * V/m² = V² s/(A m³ ). But V is J/C, J is N·m, N is kg·m/s², so V is kg·m²/(C s² ). Therefore, V² is kg² m^4/(C² s^4 ). Therefore, mu_0 J_m units are kg² m^4/(C² s^4 ) * s /(A m³ ). So we get kg² m / (C² A s^3 ). C is A s, so C² A s^3 = A^3 s^5. Therefore, kg² m / (A^3 s^5 ). The left-hand side of Faraday's Law, curl E, is V/m², which is kg·m/(C s³ ). With C= A s, that's kg/(A s^4 m ). So...\n\nThis seems like the units don't align. So maybe I messed up the scaling constants. Alternatively, the proper implementation needs scaling using 1/c^2 or something else. Hence, perhaps not the mu_0 but a different coefficient.\n\nIf we go back to the differential equations. The standard Maxwell's equations incorporate the constants to account for unit conversion between electric and magnetic fields. If we bring in magnetic monopoles, then to maintain the symmetry, while keeping the existing constants, we probably need to adjust both Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law, each involving the appropriate constants.\n\nAlternatively, references mention that when magnetic monopoles are present, you introduce a magnetic charge density ρ_m and a magnetic current density J_m, and adjust the equations as follows:\n\ndiv E = ρ_e / ε0\n\ndiv B = μ0 ρ_m\n\ncurl E = - ∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m\n\ncurl B = μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t + μ0 J_e\n\nBut looking at the units, let's first check equation 3:\n\ncurl E has units of T/s (since curl E = - dB/dt). Wait, dB/dt is ∂B/∂t, which is in T/s, and curl E is (∇×E), which is in (V/m)/m, so V/m². T is Wb/m², so T/s is (Wb/m²)/s. But V = Wb/s, hence (V·s/m²)/s = V/m². So yes, ∂B/∂t is in the same unit as curl E (V/m²).\n\nNow, μ0 J_m: μ0 is in H/m (H = Wb/A). J_m is magnetic current density, which would be (Wb/s)/m² → Wb/(s·m²). So μ0 J_m is (Wb/A·m) * (Wb/s·m² ) → Wb²/(A·s·m³ ). But Wb = V·s = T·m², so substitute:\n\n(T·m² * s )/(A·s·m³ ) = T/(A·m ). But T = N/(A·m) since F = I L × B → N = A·m·T → T = N/(A·m ). Hence, μ0 J_m would have units T/(A·m ). But the left-hand side is curl E in V/m². Let me relate T and V:\n\nV = Wb/s → Wb is V·s, so T = Wb/m² = V·s/m². Therefore, V/m² = T/s.\n\nThen μ0 J_m in T/(A·m ), compared to V/m² (which is T/s). Therefore, unless there's a conversion via 1/A, they don't line up. This suggests that the term in the equation should be scaled by a factor that introduces a time derivative.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Ampère's Law, we have J_e (electric current) which has units A/m² = C/(s·m²), and ∂E/∂t has units (V/m)/s = (N/(C·m))/s = (kg·m/(s³·A·m ))/s = kg/(s⁴·A). Then μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t would involve:\n\nμ0 is kg·m/(A²·s² ), ε0 is A²·s⁴/(kg·m³ ). So μ0 ε0 is (kg·m/(A²·s² )) * (A²·s⁴/(kg·m³ )) = s²/m². Therefore, μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t has units s²/m² * kg/(s⁴·A ) = kg/(m²·s²·A ). But B is kg/(A·s² ), so curl B has units kg/(A·s²·m ). So a mismatch again. Wait, perhaps I need different analysis.\n\nThis approach via units is getting too convoluted, perhaps I need to recall known modified Maxwell equations with monopoles.\n\nAccording to Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, when magnetic monopoles are introduced, the equations become:\n\n∇·E = 4πρ_e\n\n∇·B = 4πρ_m\n\n∇×E = - (1/c)[∂B/∂t + 4πJ_m]\n\n∇×B = (1/c)[∂E/∂t + 4πJ_e]\n\nIn Gaussian units. These equations have symmetry between E and B when charges and currents are included. Translating this into SI units (which might obscure some symmetry):\n\nTo write Maxwell's equations in SI units with monopoles, need to incorporate factors of c, μ0, ε0. However, the correspondence between Gaussian and SI units is non-trivial. But in some references, the SI versions are:\n\n∇·E = ρ_e / ε0\n\n∇·B = μ0 ρ_m\n\n∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m\n\n∇×B = μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t + μ0 J_e\n\nSo, which equations change? Originally, ∇·B = 0, but with monopoles, it would be ∇·B = μ0 ρ_m. Hence, Gauss's Law for magnetism. Faraday's Law originally is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, and with monopoles, we now have an extra term -μ0 J_m, a magnetic current density term. So both these equations (Equations 2 and 3) change.\n\nHence, in the parallel universe with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations that change are Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law of induction. The other two equations (Gauss's Law for electricity and Ampère's Law) don't change in their form, except possibly to include magnetic terms? Wait, Ampère's Law originally features the electric current and displacement current (J_e and ∂E/∂t). So Ampère's Law in the modified scenario would not necessarily get a term until you consider magnetic displacement currents or something else.

In a parallel universe where isolated magnetic monopoles (north or south poles) exist, the structure of Maxwell’s equations changes to account for the presence of magnetic charge density (\(\rho_m\)) and magnetic current density (\(\mathbf{J}_m\)). Specifically, two of Maxwell’s equations are modified:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: In our universe, this equation states that the divergence of the magnetic field (\(\mathbf{B}\)) is zero because there are no magnetic monopoles. However, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation includes a term for the magnetic charge density (\(\rho_m\)):
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m
   \]
   This is analogous to Gauss's Law for electric fields, which includes electric charge density.

2. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: In our universe, Faraday's Law states that the curl of the electric field (\(\mathbf{E}\)) is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic field. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, this equation must include a term for the magnetic current density (\(\mathbf{J}_m\)) to maintain consistency with the continuity equation for magnetic charge:
   \[
   \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m
   \]
   This modification introduces a term proportional to the magnetic current density, similar to how Ampère's Law includes the electric current density.

The other two Maxwell equations, Gauss's Law for electric fields and Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, remain structurally the same as in our universe because they already account for electric charge density and current density respectively.

### Final Answer
The equations that change in the presence of isolated magnetic monopoles are \boxed{\text{Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Let me think.

In the standard equations:
1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0
3. curl E = - dB/dt
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

When adding magnetic monopoles:
- div B would have a term for magnetic charge density, say rho_m
- Faraday's Law might pick up a term for the magnetic current density J_m, similar to how Ampère's Law has J_e

So, the modified equations could be:
1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = mu_0 rho_m
3. curl E = - dB/dt - J_m (some constant like mu_0 appears here, perhaps)
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

Wait, but actually, because of unit consistency. Let's see.

In the original equations, B has units of Tesla, E in V/m. Charge densities and current densities have their respective units.

If we have a magnetic charge, perhaps the units would be in webers (Wb). But then to get units matched, the equation for div B = something with magnetic charge density. To keep compatibility, divergence would be in T/m, so if rho_m is in Wb/m²?

Alternatively, perhaps the dimensions need to be re-examined.

Moreover, when considering the duality transformation in electromagnetism, introducing magnetic charges would adjust the equations symmetrically. So, typically, if you have both electric and magnetic charges, Maxwell's equations take a more symmetric form, where each field has a divergence proportional to their charge density, and each curl is related to the time derivative of the other field plus the corresponding current.

But dimensionally, the constants in the equations (epsilon_0 and mu_0) would come into play to get the units right. For instance, in the Faraday Law modification, adding a term involving the magnetic current would require a factor to adjust the units appropriately.

Alternatively, SI units can be a bit tricky here, perhaps Gaussian units might make the symmetry clearer? Let's think.

In Gaussian units, Maxwell's equations have factors of c (speed of light). However, SI might complicate things.

Alternatively, in a unit system where c=1, the symmetry becomes more apparent.

But perhaps in the standard SI system, modifying Maxwell's equations to include magnetic monopoles would adjust two equations: Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law. So div B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, and curl E would get a term proportional to the magnetic current.

But which equations?

Original equations (SI units):
1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0
3. curl E = - dB/dt
4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

With monopoles, equation 2 becomes div B = mu_0 rho_m or something. But wait, units of rho_e is C/m^3. What's the unit for magnetic charge?

Maybe we need to decide what unit the magnetic charge would have. If we follow the Dirac quantization condition, where the product of electric and magnetic charges is a multiple of Planck's constant over 2π, but perhaps in terms of units, the magnetic charge would have units of weber (since magnetic flux is in webers, and a monopole would produce a flux proportional to its charge). So maybe rho_m is in Wb/m^3. Then div B, which has units of Tesla/m (since divergence is per meter), but Tesla = Wb/m², so Tesla/m is Wb/m³. So, the term div B would be rho_m (in Wb/m³), so equation 2 would be div B = rho_m, but Sigma's Units registered? But original equation for div E is in Coulomb per (epsilon_0 * m^3). Wait, no, in SI, Gauss's Law is div E = rho / epsilon_0. So E is (V/m), divergence of E is (V/m²). Meanwhile, rho is C/m^3, so (C/m^3)/epsilon_0 (C/(V m))) would give (V/m²). Okay, so units work out.

If we propose that equation 2 changes from div B = 0 to div B = mu_0 * rho_m, then the units would need rho_m to have units of (Tesla/m) / mu_0. But mu_0 is in H/m (henrys per meter) which is Tesla·m/A. So rho_m would have units (T/m) / (T·m/A) = A/m². That may not be ideal. Alternatively.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of magnetic monopoles, equation 2 will be div B = rho_m, where rho_m is the magnetic charge density. Then to make the units consistent, if rho_m is in weber/m^3, and since div B is in T/m (because B is T, divergence is 1/m, so in T/m). But Weber is T·m². So Weber/m³ is T·m²/m³ = T/m. So T/m (div B) on the left and rho_m (T/m) on the right, so unit-wise, consistent. Therefore, equation 2 becomes div B = rho_m. However, note that Maxwell's equations in SI have factors of mu_0 and epsilon_0, so this may complicate.

Wait, perhaps in that case the proper equation should have a scaling factor. Such as div B = mu_0 rho_m. If in original equations, equation 1 is div E = rho_e / epsilon_0. So when you have a magnetic charge density rho_m, if you want equation 2 to be similar, then div B = mu_0 rho_m. Let's check units.

What is the unit of rho_e / epsilon_0?

rho_e is in C/m³. epsilon_0 is in C²/(N·m²). Therefore, rho_e / epsilon_0 has units (C/m³)/ (C²/(N·m²)) ) = N·m²/(C·m³) = N/(C·m). Now, Newton is kg·m/s², C is A·s. Then whole unit is kg/(A·s³·m). Hmmm. How does that relate to E and div E? The divergence of E is in units of (V/m)/m = V/m². Since V is J/C = (kg·m²/s³)/A·s = kg·m²/(A·s⁴). So V/m² is kg/(A·s⁴·m). So to have consistency, (kg/(A·s³·m )) (something) should equal kg/(A·s⁴·m). Wait, maybe my units check is getting too convoluted here.

Another angle: in Gauss's Law for electric fields, div E = rho_e / epsilon_0.

To make Gauss's Law for magnetism similar, with magnetic charge density rho_m, we might have div B = mu_0 rho_m. Then, considering the units, rho_m would have the unit of magnetic charge per volume. Let's assume magnetic charge g (in Weber), so rho_m is Wb/m³. Div B is T/m. Since 1 Wb = T·m², so Wb/m³ is T/m². T/m² is different from T/m. Maybe even this needs adjusting; perhaps the units don't align. Alternatively, perhaps if we model the magnetic charge density as some term to make the units work. For example, if div B = rho_m * mu_0, then mu_0 is H/m (H is Wb/A). So H/m * rho_m in ??? Units. Let me compute.

If mu_0 has unit H/m (henry per meter). Henry is Wb/A. So mu_0 is Wb/(A·m). rho_m if it's in magnetic charge per volume, suppose unit is A·m (since for rho_e it's C/m³= A·s/m³). Magnetic charge could be Weber, which is V·s = T·m². So rho_m in Wb/m³. Then mu_0 * rho_m would be (Wb/(A·m))*(Wb/m³) = (Wb)^2/(A·m⁴). But div B is T/m = Wb/(m²·m) = Wb/m³. So if right-hand side here has units (Wb^2)/(A·m⁴), which is different from left-hand side's Wb/m³. That doesn't match. Therefore, the units don't match here.

Alternatively, if the magnetic charge density's unit is (Wb/m³), then perhaps div B = rho_m / mu_0. Then mu_0 is H/m = Wb/(A·m). So (Wb/m³)/(Wb/(A·m)) = A·m/m³ = A/m². However, div B is in T/m = Wb/m³. So doesn't match.

Hmm, apparently, unit analysis isn't so straightforward here. Maybe there is a different convention. Let me refer to how electric charge and current are treated.

Alternatively, if in another unit system, like Gaussian units, where Maxwell's equations are symmetric except for factors of c.

Wait, in Gaussian units, electric and magnetic fields have the same units. Gauss's Law is div E = 4π rho_e, Gauss's law for magnetism is div B = 4π rho_m, Faraday's Law is curl E = - (1/c) dB/dt - (4π/c) J_m, and Ampère's Law is curl B = (1/c) dE/dt + (4π/c) J_e.

But in SI units, it's a different story.

Alternatively, going to the concept of duality transformation. In the presence of magnetic charge and current densities, Maxwell's equations become:

div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

div B = mu_0 rho_m

curl E = - dB/dt - J_m

curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e

But how do the units play here?

Alternatively, for Faraday's Law adding a term related to the magnetic current. Suppose instead Faraday's Law is:

curl E = - dB/dt - J_m some constant factor.

But the original Faraday's Law in SI is:

curl E = - dB/dt (units of dB/dt is T/s. Curl E is (V/m)/m = V/m². T/s is (Wb/m²)/s. Since Wb is V·s, so T/s is V·s/(m² s) = V/m². So yes, units align.

If we add a term J_m, which would be magnetic current density (unit ?). If J_e is electric current density (A/m² = C/(s·m²)).

If magnetic current density J_m is in Weber/(s·m²), since Weber is V·s, so J_m would be (V·s)/(s·m²) = V/m². Which is the same unit as the other terms in Faraday's Law. So then, Faraday's equation could have a term - J_m. But then, Ampère's Law would be: curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 dE/dt + mu_0 J_e, with dE/dt in (V/m)/s = V/(m·s) = (N·m/C)/m·s = (kg·m/(s³·A))/m·s )= kg/(s⁴·A). B's curl is (T/m)= (Wb/m²)/m. Wb is V·s, so T/m is V·s/m³. Hmm.

Alternatively, to make units match, maybe factors of mu_0 and epsilon_0 need to be incorporated into the additional terms in Faraday's and Ampère's Laws.

Alternatively, according to some references, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations in SI units become:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0

2. div B = mu_0 rho_m

3. curl E = - partial B / partial t - mu_0 J_m

4. curl B = mu_0 epsilon_0 partial E / partial t + mu_0 J_e

So in this case, equations 2 and 3 are modified. Let's verify the units here.

First, equation 3: curl E has units V/m². The term -partial B/partial t is in T/s. To convert T to Weber/m², 1 T = 1 Wb/m². Therefore, T/s = Wb/(m² s) = V·s/(m² s) = V/m², which matches the units for curl E. Then, the term - mu_0 J_m. mu_0 is in H/m = Wb/(A·m). J_m is the magnetic current density, which is in Weber/(s·m²) (since magnetic charge is Weber, so current is Weber/s, and density is that per m²). So mu_0 * J_m has units (Wb/(A·m)) * (Wb/(s·m²)) ). Wb is V·s, so plugging that in: (V·s/(A·m)) * (V·s)/(s·m²)) = V²·s²/(A·m³ s) ). Let's simplify: V²·s/(A·m³ ). But V is J/C, J is N·m, N is kg·m/s². So V is (kg·m/s² · m )/(C ) since C is A·s. Therefore, V is (kg·m²)/(C·s²), and V squared is (kg²·m^4)/(C²·s^4). Therefore, the units of mu_0 J_m is ((kg²·m^4)/(C²·s^4 )) * s / (A·m³)) ). C is A·s, so substituting, we get (kg²·m^4)/( (A·s)²·s^4 ) * s / (A·m³ )) ). Let's compute exponents:

Numerator: kg², m^4, s in the numerator from *s.

Denominator: (A^2 s^2 * s^4) )* A m^3 = A^3 s^6 m^3.

Therefore, kg² m^4 s / (A^3 s^6 m^3 ) ) = kg² m / (A^3 s^5 ). This seems complicated, but maybe not meaningful. Alternatively, since we know that mu_0 has units of H/m, and J_m has units of V/m², so H=Wb/A, V=Wb/s. So H/m is Wb/(A m) = V·s/(A m ). Therefore, mu_0 *(V/m²) is V·s/(A m ) * V/m² = V² s/(A m³ ). But V is J/C, J is N·m, N is kg·m/s², so V is kg·m²/(C s² ). Therefore, V² is kg² m^4/(C² s^4 ). Therefore, mu_0 J_m units are kg² m^4/(C² s^4 ) * s /(A m³ ). So we get kg² m / (C² A s^3 ). C is A s, so C² A s^3 = A^3 s^5. Therefore, kg² m / (A^3 s^5 ). The left-hand side of Faraday's Law, curl E, is V/m², which is kg·m/(C s³ ). With C= A s, that's kg/(A s^4 m ). So...

This seems like the units don't align. So maybe I messed up the scaling constants. Alternatively, the proper implementation needs scaling using 1/c^2 or something else. Hence, perhaps not the mu_0 but a different coefficient.

If we go back to the differential equations. The standard Maxwell's equations incorporate the constants to account for unit conversion between electric and magnetic fields. If we bring in magnetic monopoles, then to maintain the symmetry, while keeping the existing constants, we probably need to adjust both Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law, each involving the appropriate constants.

Alternatively, references mention that when magnetic monopoles are present, you introduce a magnetic charge density ρ_m and a magnetic current density J_m, and adjust the equations as follows:

div E = ρ_e / ε0

div B = μ0 ρ_m

curl E = - ∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m

curl B = μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t + μ0 J_e

But looking at the units, let's first check equation 3:

curl E has units of T/s (since curl E = - dB/dt). Wait, dB/dt is ∂B/∂t, which is in T/s, and curl E is (∇×E), which is in (V/m)/m, so V/m². T is Wb/m², so T/s is (Wb/m²)/s. But V = Wb/s, hence (V·s/m²)/s = V/m². So yes, ∂B/∂t is in the same unit as curl E (V/m²).

Now, μ0 J_m: μ0 is in H/m (H = Wb/A). J_m is magnetic current density, which would be (Wb/s)/m² → Wb/(s·m²). So μ0 J_m is (Wb/A·m) * (Wb/s·m² ) → Wb²/(A·s·m³ ). But Wb = V·s = T·m², so substitute:

(T·m² * s )/(A·s·m³ ) = T/(A·m ). But T = N/(A·m) since F = I L × B → N = A·m·T → T = N/(A·m ). Hence, μ0 J_m would have units T/(A·m ). But the left-hand side is curl E in V/m². Let me relate T and V:

V = Wb/s → Wb is V·s, so T = Wb/m² = V·s/m². Therefore, V/m² = T/s.

Then μ0 J_m in T/(A·m ), compared to V/m² (which is T/s). Therefore, unless there's a conversion via 1/A, they don't line up. This suggests that the term in the equation should be scaled by a factor that introduces a time derivative.

Alternatively, considering that in Ampère's Law, we have J_e (electric current) which has units A/m² = C/(s·m²), and ∂E/∂t has units (V/m)/s = (N/(C·m))/s = (kg·m/(s³·A·m ))/s = kg/(s⁴·A). Then μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t would involve:

μ0 is kg·m/(A²·s² ), ε0 is A²·s⁴/(kg·m³ ). So μ0 ε0 is (kg·m/(A²·s² )) * (A²·s⁴/(kg·m³ )) = s²/m². Therefore, μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t has units s²/m² * kg/(s⁴·A ) = kg/(m²·s²·A ). But B is kg/(A·s² ), so curl B has units kg/(A·s²·m ). So a mismatch again. Wait, perhaps I need different analysis.

This approach via units is getting too convoluted, perhaps I need to recall known modified Maxwell equations with monopoles.

According to Jackson's Classical Electrodynamics, when magnetic monopoles are introduced, the equations become:

∇·E = 4πρ_e

∇·B = 4πρ_m

∇×E = - (1/c)[∂B/∂t + 4πJ_m]

∇×B = (1/c)[∂E/∂t + 4πJ_e]

In Gaussian units. These equations have symmetry between E and B when charges and currents are included. Translating this into SI units (which might obscure some symmetry):

To write Maxwell's equations in SI units with monopoles, need to incorporate factors of c, μ0, ε0. However, the correspondence between Gaussian and SI units is non-trivial. But in some references, the SI versions are:

∇·E = ρ_e / ε0

∇·B = μ0 ρ_m

∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m

∇×B = μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t + μ0 J_e

So, which equations change? Originally, ∇·B = 0, but with monopoles, it would be ∇·B = μ0 ρ_m. Hence, Gauss's Law for magnetism. Faraday's Law originally is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, and with monopoles, we now have an extra term -μ0 J_m, a magnetic current density term. So both these equations (Equations 2 and 3) change.

Hence, in the parallel universe with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations that change are Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law of induction. The other two equations (Gauss's Law for electricity and Ampère's Law) don't change in their form, except possibly to include magnetic terms? Wait, Ampère's Law originally features the electric current and displacement current (J_e and ∂E/∂t). So Ampère's Law in the modified scenario would not necessarily get a term until you consider magnetic displacement currents or something else. Hmm, but in the modified equations as per above, Ampère's Law remains as before, except including μ0 ρ_m in Gauss's Law and -μ0 J_m in Faraday's Law.

So conclusion: two equations change when magnetic monopoles are introduced: Gauss's Law for magnetism becomes ∇·B = μ0 ρ_m instead of 0, and Faraday's Law includes a term for the magnetic current density, so ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m. The other two, Gauss's Law for electricity and Ampère's Law, stay structurally the same (the latter already includes electric current and displacement current). Thus, the answer would be that Gauss's Law for magnetism (originally ∇·B=0) and Faraday's Law (now with a magnetic current term) are different in this universe.

But let me confirm again.

Original Maxwell's equations (SI):

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε0

2. ∇·B = 0

3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t

4. ∇×B = μ0ε0 ∂E/∂t + μ0 J

In presence of magnetic monopoles:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e/ε0 (unchanged)

2. ∇·B = μ0 ρ_m (changed)

3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m (changed)

4. ∇×B = μ0ε0 ∂E/∂t + μ0 J_e (unchanged in form, still involving electric current and displacement current)

Therefore, equations 2 and 3 (Gauss's magnetism and Faraday's) are modified.

But note that equation 4 (Ampère's Law) might include something if we had magnetic displacement current, but in this formulation it's only the electric terms. However, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, you can also have a displacement magnetic current, but that isn't typically incorporated because Faraday's Law naturally has the time derivative of B. Since magnetic monopoles introduce a continuity equation for magnetic charge, similar to electric charge. The continuity equation for magnetic charge would be ∂ρ_m/∂t + ∇·J_m = 0, analogous to the electric one. Therefore, in Maxwell's equations, the term that accounts for the time derivative of the magnetic field (Faraday's Law) had to include the magnetic current density to maintain that continuity. Thus, yes, equations 2 and 3 are modified.


**Final Answer**
In a universe with isolated magnetic poles, Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law are altered. The modified equations become:

- Gauss's Law for magnetism: \$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m\$
- Faraday's Law: \$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m\$

Thus, the equations that change are \boxed{\text{Gauss's Law for magnetism and Faraday's Law}}.
