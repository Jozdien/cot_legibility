# Original Question

You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? 
After tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:
- resistance of g1: 75% of control
- resistance of g2: 0% from control
- resistance of g3: 50% from control
-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control
- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control
- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control

Which conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?

Based on the experimental data and the requirement that at least one gene acts as a transcription factor (TF) upstream of others, the following conclusions can be drawn:

### Key Observations:
1. **G2 is essential for resistance**:  
   - Single mutant **g2** has **0% resistance**, and all double mutants involving **g2** (g1g2, g2g3) also show **0% resistance**. This indicates that G2 is critical for resistance, and its loss cannot be compensated by other genes.  

2. **G1 and G3 modulate G2's activity**:  
   - **g1** (75% resistance) and **g3** (50% resistance) show partial loss of resistance, suggesting G1 and G3 enhance G2's function but are not strictly required.  
   - **g1g3** exhibits **10% resistance**, worse than either single mutant, implying additive/synergistic roles of G1 and G3 in activating G2.  

3. **Epistatic relationships**:  
   - G2 is **epistatic** to G1 and G3 (double mutants with g2 mirror g2’s phenotype). This places G2 **downstream** in the pathway.  

### Genetic Interaction Model:
- **G2 is the transcription factor** directly responsible for resistance. It likely activates defense genes.  
- **G1 and G3 act upstream**, regulating G2’s activity (e.g., enhancing its expression, stability, or signaling inputs).  
  - Wild type: Full G2 activation via G1 and G3 → 100% resistance.  
  - **g1/g3 mutants**: Partial G2 activity → intermediate resistance (75% or 50%).  
  - **g1g3 double**: Minimal G2 activity due to loss of both regulators → 10% residual resistance.  

### Conclusion:
**G2 is the critical transcription factor downstream in the pathway**, with **G1 and G3 modulating its activity upstream**. This satisfies the condition that at least one gene (G2) acts as a transcription factor, though its regulatory role is positioned downstream to integrate inputs from G1 and G3. The epistasis and additive effects in double mutants confirm this hierarchy.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, let's try to figure out how these genes interact based on the data. So, the wild-type resistance is 100%, and the mutants have lower resistance. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. We need to determine the relationships between G1, G2, and G3.

First, let me list the data again to make sure I have it right:

- Wild type (control): 100% resistance.
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. So knocking out any gene reduces resistance, but the extent varies. The biggest drop is in g2, which goes to 0%. Then g3 is half, and g1 is 75%. So G2 seems most critical because its knockout completely removes resistance. Maybe G2 is the main gene, and the others are modifiers?

But wait, the double mutants are even lower. For instance, g1g3 is worse (10%) than either single mutant (g1 at 75%, g3 at 50%). But when combining g1 and g3, it's not additive. 75% and 50% might multiply to 37.5%, but the actual is 10%, which is even lower. Not sure if that's a simple multiplicative effect.

But g2g3 is 0%, same as g2 alone. Similarly, g1g2 is 0%. So when either g1 or g3 is combined with g2, the resistance is as low as g2 alone. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Epistasis means that the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If G2 is downstream, then a knockout of G2 would mask the effects of other genes. But if G2 is upstream, then... Wait, the problem says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So maybe G2 is the upstream gene.

Wait, typically, if gene A is upstream of gene B, then knocking out A would prevent B from being expressed. So, if A is a transcription factor needed for B's expression, then the phenotype of a A knockout would be similar to a A;B double knockout. But here, in double knockouts involving g2 (like g1g2 or g2g3), the resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. So maybe G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Which would mean that G2 acts downstream. But wait, the transcription factor would be upstream. So there's a contradiction here.

Wait, let's consider that a transcription factor acts upstream. So if G2 is the transcription factor, then knocking it out would disable all downstream genes. So say G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. Then in g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed, leading to 0%. But in the double mutants like g1g3, if G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, then even in the double knockout, since G2 is wild type, their presence or absence might not matter. But that's conflicting with the data because g1g3 has lower resistance than each single mutant.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both contributing to resistance, and G2 is part of both pathways. For example, if G2 is required for both G1 and G3. Then, in g2 mutant, both pathways are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. If you knock out G1, then you only block its pathway, leaving G3's pathway active (but needing G2). Wait, but in that case, if G1 is knocked out, then resistance would be whatever G3's contribution is, but if G2 is required for G3, then in G1 knockout, G3 can still function, provided G2 is present. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, suppose that the pathway is linear. Let's try a hierarchical approach. If G2 is upstream, then it activates both G1 and G3. So in wild type, G2 activates G1 and G3, which then contribute to resistance. But that might not fit with the data.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then in g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed. Then, the resistance would be 0% (which matches the data for g2). But in g1 mutant, if G2 is functional, then G3 is expressed (since it's upstream). The resistance in g1 is 75%. Then G1 isn't required, but it contributes 25% of the resistance? Similarly, g3 is 50%. So if both G1 and G3 contribute when G2 is active, then perhaps total resistance is additive. So wild type: G2 active, so both G1 and G3 contribute. In g1, G3 is still active (because G2 is okay), so maybe you're missing G1's contribution. Wait, but the data says g1 has 75% resistance. That would imply that G1 contributes 25% (since 100% - 25% = 75%). Similarly, g3 has 50%, so G3 contributes 50%. But in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, but if they're downstream of G2, which is functional, then their knockout would still leave nothing, so resistance would be 0%. But wait, the data says g1g3 is 10%. So that doesn't fit. Because if G1 and G3 are the only downstream genes of G2, then the double knockout would be 0%, but in reality, it's 10%. So maybe there's another pathway.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, and they themselves depend on G2. For example, G2 is a transcription factor activating G1 and G3. So if G2 is not present, then neither G1 nor G3 are active. Then:

- Wild type: G2 active, G1 and G3 active. Resistance 100%.
- g2: both G1 and G3 inactive. Resistance 0% (matches data).
- g1: G3 active (since G2 is functional), resistance missing G1's part. Since g1 is 75%, that would imply that G1 contributes 25%, and G3 contributes 50% (since 25% loss). But if G1 and G3 are additive, then G1 is 25, G3 is 50, and maybe a baseline of 25 from something else, but that complicates.

Wait, but when combining g1 and g3 (the double mutant g1g3), their resistance is 10%. But if they both depend on G2 for their expression, then in the g1g3 mutant, even though G2 is functional, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so resistance would be 0% missing these two. But the data says g1g3 is 10%. That 10% could be part of a parallel pathway that doesn't involve G1 or G3, but the problem states that these are the candidate genes, so maybe the 10% is residual.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is acting downstream of G1 and G3. If G1 and G3 both regulate G2. So, for example, G1 and G3 activate G2. Then, knocking out G1 would reduce activation of G2, leading to lower G2 activity, and thus lower resistance. Similarly for G3. But if G2 is knocked out, then resistance is 0%, as in g2 and any double with g2.

But let's test this with the data.

If G1 and G3 regulate G2:

- In g1 mutant, G2 is only partially active (maybe due to G3 still working). So if G1 contributes 25% activation of G2, then knocking out G1 would lower G2's activity by 25%. If resistance is proportional to G2 activity, then the resistance would be 75%, which matches the data for g1. Similarly, g3's knockout would lower G2 activity by 50% (since g3 has 50% resistance), so G3 contributes 50% activation. Then in the double mutant g1g3, G2 would be 0 (100-25-50=25? No. Or maybe additive: g1 and g3 each reduce G2 activation. If without G1, G2 is at 75%, without G3, G2 is at 50%, then without both, G2 is at 25% (100 -25 -50=25? If additive). But then the resistance would be 25%, but the data for g1g3 is 10%. Hmm, maybe they are multiplicative. 0.75 *0.5 = 0.375, but the data is 10%? That's not matching. Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are both required for G2 function. For example, both G1 and G3 need to be active for G2 to work. But then in the absence of either, G2 doesn't work, which would result in g1 being 0%, which it is not. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is part of both the G1 and G3 pathways. Like, if there are parallel pathways where G1 needs G2 and G3 also needs G2. Wait, that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: the triple mutant (assuming there was one) would be 0%, but since we don't have that. The key maybe is that in the double mutants with g2, their resistance is 0%. So if any double knockout includes g2, the resistance is 0. This is because G2 is critical. Similarly, in the single mutants, only g2 is 0%, so G2 is essential.

Alternatively, when G2 is inactivated, other genes can't compensate. But when G1 is inactivated, there's still partial resistance (75%), suggesting that G1 is partially redundant with other genes.

Wait, here's another angle. Let's suppose that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G2 is in a separate pathway. So if G2 is non-functional (g2 mutant), then that pathway is dead, so resistance is 0%, regardless of G1 and G3. In the case of g1 and g3 mutants, they only affect their own pathway (maybe G2's pathway is still working).

But if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then the double mutant g1g3 would have that pathway completely off, leaving only G2 pathway. But in reality, g1g3 has 10%, so maybe the residual 10% is from the G2 pathway. If that's the case, then in wild type, the total resistance is the sum of both pathways. For example, if G1 and G3 contribute 90% and G2 contributes 10%, then:

- g1 single would be 0% from G1/G3 pathway (if G1 is essential for that pathway) + 10% (from G2) = 10%. But in reality, g1 is 75%, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe we need to use the concept of epistatic relationships. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then a mutation in A will mask the phenotype of B. So the double mutant AB would look like A.

Looking at the data:

- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g3: 10% (lower than either single mutant)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)

So, when combining g2 with either g1 or g3, the double mutant has the same phenotype as g2 (0%). That suggests that g2 is epistatic to both g1 and g3. In other words, G2 is downstream of G1 and G3. Because if G2 is downstream, then knocking out G2 would negate any effect of knocking out G1 or G3. 

But if G2 is downstream, then the transcription factor upstream would have to be G1 or G3. But the problem states that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. If G2 is downstream, then it can't be the upstream transcription factor. So perhaps G1 or G3 is the transcription factor upstream, and G2 is downstream. 

Wait, but if G2 is downstream of G1 and G3, then G2's expression depends on them. But how does that fit the data? Let's think: If G1 is a transcription factor required for G2 expression, then in a g1 mutant, G2 isn't expressed. So both G1 and G2 being absent would result in the same phenotype. But in the data, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance, but a g2 mutant is 0%. So that can't be correct. Similarly, if G3 is the transcription factor necessary for G2, then in g3 mutant, G2 isn't expressed, and resistance would be 0%, but g3 mutant is 50%. So that's also inconsistent. 

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the transcription factor upstream. Let's say G2 activates both G1 and G3. Then, in g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, so the resistance would be 0%. Which matches. Then, in g1 mutant, since G2 is functional, G1 isn't expressed, but G3 is. So resistance is 50% (from G3). Wait, but the data says g1 has 75%. That's conflicting. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the three genes work in a chain: G1 → G2 → G3. Or G3 → G2 → G1. Let's try that. If G1 is upstream of G2, which is upstream of G3. Then knocking out G1 would lead to both G2 and G3 not being expressed. So resistance would be 0%, but in data g1 is 75%, so that's not matching.

Alternatively, suppose that G2 is in the middle. G1 → G2 → G3. Then knocking out G1 would prevent G2 and G3. Again, resistance would be 0% for g1, which doesn't fit.

This is getting confusing. Let's summarize the data again. For single mutants:

- g2 has the strongest effect (0%), then g3 (50%), then g1 (75%).

Double mutants:

- If you combine g1 with g3 (g1g3), resistance drops to 10% (much lower than either single mutant). But combining either (g1 or g3) with g2 results in 0%.

If G2 is necessary for the function of both G1 and G3, then in g2 mutant, resistance is 0% regardless of G1 and G3. But in single mutants of G1 (g1), since G2 is active, then the resistance is G3's contribution (since G1 is missing). But why would g1 be 75%? That would mean that G1 only contributes 25%, while G3 contributes 50% (since 100% - G1's 25% is 75% for g1, and 50% for g3 implies G3 contributes 50%). But in g1g3, when both are missing, the resistance is 10%, which might suggest that in the absence of both G1 and G3, there's still a small residual resistance (possibly through another pathway not involving these genes). However, the question states that these are the candidate genes, so maybe that residual is due to experimental variation.

So if G2 is required for both G1 and G3's function, but G1 and G3 work in additive pathways (both contribute to resistance). Then:

- Wild type: G2 active, so both G1 and G3 contribute. Their contributions add to 100%. If G3 contributes 50%, and G1 contributes 25%, then total is 75%? But wild type is 100%. Hmm, maybe their contributions multiply? Like G1 and G3 each have independent pathways. If G1 confers 75% resistance (so in its absence you're at 75%, implying it's responsible for 25%), and G3 in its absence you have 50% implying it's responsible for 50% of resistance. Then when both are absent, you have 100% -25% -50% = 25%? But data says g1g3 is 10%. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if each gene provides a component, such that resistance is the product of their contributions. For instance:

Assume that each gene provides a certain level, and the total resistance is the product.

For example:

Wild type: 100% = G1 * G2 * G3.

If single knockouts:

g1: 75% = (g1 ko effect) * G2 * G3.

But this approach might not make sense because if each gene's contribution is a multiplier, then knocking out a gene would set its multiplier. For example, if G2 is set to 0 when knocked out, then everything else would be 0. Which matches the data for g2. Then, for g1, maybe its multiplier is 0.75 (so wild type where all are 1.0 gives resistance 1.0*1.0*1.0=1.0, so 100%. For g1: 0.75*1.0*1.0=0.75 (75%). For g3: 1.0*1.0*0.5=0.5 (50%). Then, g1g3: 0.75*1.0*0.5=0.375 (37.5%). But the data says 10%. So that model isn't matching.

Alternatively, maybe resistance is additive but with redundancy. For example, G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. If G1 is knocked out, then G3 can partially compensate, and vice versa.

But again, how?

Perhaps it's better to look for epistatic relationships. For instance, if mutation in G2 is epistatic to mutations in G1 and G3, then G2 must act downstream. But the problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream. If G2 is upstream (transcription factor), then mutants downstream (G1 or G3) would not affect its function.

Wait, maybe the genes act in a pathway like this: G2 (transcription factor) → activates G1 and G3 → which then contribute to resistance. So in g2 knockouts, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. In g1 knockouts, G3 is still expressed (since G2 is active) and vice versa.

If the resistance contributions are additive: G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. Then, wild type has 25+50 =75%? But then where's the other 25%? Hmmm, perhaps other genes not considered here. But the question says these are the candidates. So maybe in this model, the 75% for g1 is due to only G3's 50% plus something else, but it's confusing.

Alternatively, in wild type, G2 activates G1 and G3. The total resistance is the sum of functions of G1 and G3, each of which need G2. So:

- Wild type: G1 + G3 = 100%. So maybe G1 is 25% and G3 is 75%. But in g1: 75% (remaining G3). In g3: 25% (remaining G1). But g1 is 75%, so maybe G3 is 75%, and G1 is 25%. Then in g1g3 double mutant, since G2 is active, but G1 and G3 are both inactive, resistance is 0%. But the data shows g1g3 is 10%, so conflicting.

This is tough. Maybe another way: Let's take the given that in the double mutants with g2 (g1g2, g2g3), the phenotype is 0%, same as g2 alone. So mutations in G1 or G3 don't add anything when G2 is mutated. This suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, which would mean that G2 is downstream in the pathway. Because epistasis is when the downstream gene's mutation masks the upstream. For example, if G1 → G2, then if G2 is mutated, the effect of G1 is masked. So in a G1 mutant (upstream), the phenotype would be due to G2 not being activated. But here, in g2 mutant, the resistance is 0%, but in g1 mutant, it's 75%. That would not mask if G2 is downstream. 

Wait, traditional epistasis example: If A → B → C (A is upstream), then a knockout of A would stop B and C. A knockout of B would allow A to function, but C is inactive. So the phenotypes would be different. For example:

- Wild type: all active, 100% resistance.
- a: 0% (since B and C are inactive)
- b: 0% (C is inactive)
- c: 0%

But in our case, the data is different. If G2 were downstream (like B in the example), then knocking out G2 would lead to 0% resistance regardless of upstream genes. So any mutant with G2 knockout (g2, g1g2, g2g3) would have 0%. Which matches the data. Then, if G1 and G3 are upstream of G2, then in their single mutants, the downstream gene G2's function would be affected.

For example:

If G1 and G3 both are required for G2's activity. Then, in g1 mutant, G2 is only partially active (since G3 is active), leading to lower resistance. Similarly for g3. But then how much?

Alternatively, maybe G2 is activated by both G1 and G3. So the activity of G2 depends on both G1 and G3. Then, the total resistance is determined by G2's activity level.

Suppose wild-type G1 and G3 activate G2 fully (100% resistance). Then:

- If G1 is knocked out, G2 is activated by G3, but only partially. Let's say G3 alone activates G2 to 75% resistance.

- If G3 is knocked out, G1 alone activates G2 to 50% resistance.

- If both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 isn't activated (assuming they are required), leading to 0% resistance. But the data says g1g3 is 10% instead. Maybe some leaky expression?

But according to the data, g1g3 is 10%, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the activation is additive. Say, G1 provides 25% activation and G3 provides 50%, so total activation is 75% by G1 and 50% by G3 summing to 125%? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, multiplicative? But even then, doesn't explain the values.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that itself contributes to resistance, but its activation (or level) is influenced by G1 and G3. For example, G1 enhances G2's activity, and G3 does the same. 

So in wild type, G2 activity is boosted by G1 and G3. If G1 is missing, G2's activity is at 75% (wild-type G2 without G1's boost), so resistance is 75%. If G3 is missing, G2's activity is 50%. If both G1 and G3 are missing, G2's activity is 10%. That fits the data for g1 (75%), g3 (50%), g1g3 (10%). Then, when G2 is knocked out, it's 0%. Also, if G2 is required for its own function, then when you knock out G2 (or even if you have G1 and G3 active), it doesn't matter. So the double mutants with g2 don't add anything, hence same as g2.

In this scenario, G2 is the main gene whose activity level determines resistance. G1 and G3 are modifiers that enhance G2's activity. However, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream. In this case, G2 itself might be the gene downstream regulated by G1 and G3. But being a transcription factor is usually associated with acting upstream.

But if G2 is the transcription factor that directly confers resistance by activating defense genes, then G1 and G3 could be regulators of G2's activity. For example, G1 and G3 enhance the expression or activity of G2. 

Thus, the conclusion would be that G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream, and G1 and G3 positively regulate G2. However, I need to check if this fits all the data.

So:

- Wild-type: G1 and G3 are active, leading to full activation of G2 → 100% resistance.
- g1: G3 active, G2 partially active → 75% resistance.
- g3: G1 active, G2 less active → 50% resistance.
- g1g3: Both modifiers missing, G2 activity very low → 10% resistance.
- g2: No G2 → 0% resistance, so G1 and G3 can't compensate.
- g1g2 and g2g3: G2 not active → 0% regardless of G1 and G3.

This fits all data points. Thus, the conclusion is that G2 is the key transcription factor required for resistance, with G1 and G3 acting upstream to enhance its activity. Since the problem states that at least one is a transcription factor upstream, but in this model, G1 and G3 are upstream of G2 (the transcription factor). But the way we've described it, G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 modulate its activity, but they themselves are not necessarily transcription factors. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream? But according to our model, G1 and G3 are upstream. But upstram/downstream is relative. If G1 and G3 regulate G2's activity, then they're upstream. But G2 is a transcription factor, so likely upstream in a signaling pathway leading to resistance genes. Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor that activates defense genes, then any genes regulating G2 (like G1 and G3) would be upstream in the pathway. But if G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3, which would be downstream, that would be different.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the transcription factor that's downstream, and G1 and G3 are upstream components that regulate G2's activity. For example, G1 and G3 are signaling proteins that activate G2, which then induces defense genes. In this case, G2 is the transcription factor acting at the end. So, G1 → G2, and G3 → G2. 

Then, in the knockout scenarios:

- g1: Only G3 is sending signal to G2. So G2 is less active → resistance 75%.
- g3: Only G1 is sending signal to G2 → resistance 50%.
- g1g3: No signals to G2 → G2 has low activity → 10% (maybe some basal activity).
- g2: No transcription factor → 0%.
- Any double with g2: 0%.

This arrangement fits the data.

So the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 both regulate G2, with G3 having a stronger influence than G1 (since g3 knockout has a bigger effect: 50% vs. 75%). Therefore, G1 and G3 act upstream of G2 in the pathway, with G2 being the key transcription factor necessary for resistance. In this case, this fits the condition in the problem that at least one gene (G2) is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Wait, but if G1 and G3 are upstream of G2, then G2 is acting downstream. Yet the problem states that a transcription factor is upstream. So perhaps a mistake here. Wait, transcription factors are often upstream in signaling pathways. They receive signals and then activate target genes.

Wait, actually, in many signaling pathways, the transcription factor is downstream. For example, a signaling pathway might be: signal → receptor → kinase → transcription factor → target genes. So the transcription factor is at the end, converting the signal into gene expression. So in that case, the transcription factor is downstream. So G2, as a transcription factor, is downstream, receiving input from G1 and G3, which are upstream components (like receptors or kinases).

The problem statement says "at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)". Wait, acting upstream of others—so acting upstream. If G2 is downstream being regulated by G1 and G3, then G2 is not upstream. Meaning that one of the other genes (G1 or G3) must be the upstream transcription factor.

Wait, hmm. This is conflicting. Let me re-examine the problem statement: "You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s)." So the transcription factor gene is upstream, regulates other genes. So for example, say G1 is a transcription factor that regulates G2 and G3. Then, in this case, the knocksouts of G2 or G3 would have certain effects. Let's see:

If G1 is the transcription factor regulating G2 and G3. Then, in g1 mutant, both G2 and G3 would not be expressed. Therefore, resistance would be 0% (same as g2). But according to data, g1 is 75% resistance. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if G3 is the transcription factor regulating G2. Then, in g3 mutant, G2 is not expressed, leading to resistance 0%. But in data, g3 is 50%. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the transcription factor regulates one gene, not both. For example, G1 is a transcription factor regulating G3. So in g1 mutant, G3 doesn't work. Then, resistance would be 50% as seen in g3, but data says g1 is 75%.

Alternatively, G2 is the transcription factor regulating G3. In g2 mutant, G3 isn't active, resistance is 0% (matches data for g2 and g2g3). In g3 mutant, resistance is 50%, but that would require that there's another pathway regulated by G2 that contributes 50% resistance. However, then if G2 regulates G3 and another gene which isn't part of these candidates, resistance in g3 would be G2's other pathway's contribution. But this is speculative.

This is really challenging. From the data and the given information, maybe the simplest conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor downstream, and G1 and G3 are upstream regulators. However, the question says at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. If G2 is downstream, then the transcription factor must be among G1 or G3. Yet the data doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the regulator gene is G1. For example:

G1 is a transcription factor that activates G2 and G3. So in g1 mutant, G2 and G3 are not expressed. Therefore, resistance would be 0%. But the data shows g1 mutant has 75% resistance. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are transcription factors that both activate G2. So in wild type, all three are active. In g1 mutant, G3 is still active, so G2 is expressed (but possibly at a lower level), resulting in 75% resistance. In g3 mutant, G1 is active, leading to 50% resistance. When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 is not expressed -> 0%. But data says g1g3 has 10%, so conflict. Or 10% might be independent of G2. But the data says that all double mutants with g2 are 0%, which suggests g2 is critical.

Maybe the transcription factor is G2, acting upstream of G1 and G3. So G2 activates G1 and G3, which themselves contribute to resistance. This brings us back to the earlier scenario where g1 is 75% (G3 active), g3 is 50% (G1 active), and the double knockouts would be 0% (neither G1 nor G3). But data for g1g3 is 10% instead, which is inconsistent.

Given the complexity, another angle: look at the double mutants. The most telling are cases where two mutations are combined. When combining g1 and g3 (both less severe), the resistance drops to 10%, which is worse than either single. This suggests that G1 and G3 have additive or synergistic effects. But when either is combined with g2 (which is severe), the resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. So this suggests that G2 is in the same pathway as G1 and G3, and epistatic to them. So if you take out G2, the pathway is dead regardless of G1 and G3.

So the hierarchy would be G1 and G3 → G2 → Resistance. 

So G1 and G3 act upstream of G2. G2 is the transcription factor essential for resistance. Therefore:

- g2 mutant: 0% (pathway broken).
- g1 mutant: G2 is partially active (maybe dependent on G3, hence 75% resistance).
- g3 mutant: G2 is partially active (dependent on G1, hence 50% resistance).
- g1g3 mutant: No input from G1 or G3, so G2 is inactive (10% resistance, some baseline).
- But according to data, g1g3 has 10%, suggesting a small residual activity. Maybe basal level of G2 activation without G1/G3, but the main activation is via them.

In this model, G2 is downstream and essential. Which makes sense given that all mutants involving g2 are 0%. Since the problem states that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream, but here G2 is downstream. So maybe the problem intended that transcription factor is one of them (maybe G1 or G3), but according to the data, it's unclear.

Wait, if G1 and G3 both activate G2, which is the transcription factor, then G2 is downstream but a transcription factor. Then the statement that "at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of other genes" is not met. Unless…

Wait, perhaps the fact that one of them is a transcription factor acting upstream means it regulates others. If G2 is the transcription factor, but G1 and G3 are enzymes or other proteins that influence G2 activity. Then the transcription factor in the question would be G2, but it's downstream. But the answer expecting the transc factor to be upstream.

But the problem only states that "at least one" is a transcription factor upstream. Even if G2 is the transcription factor but acting downstream, and G1/G3 are modifying its activity, it's not satisfying the "acting upstream of others" part.

Alternatively, maybe G3 is the transcription factor upstream of G2 and G1. For example, G3 acts as a transcription factor to activate G1 and G2. Then, in g3 mutant, both G1 and G2 aren't expressed. Then resistance would be 0%, but data says g3 is 50%.

Hmm. This is really perplexing. Maybe the correct answer is that G2 is the transcription factor, acting downstream, in a pathway that is influenced by G1 and G3. But the problem says at least one transcription factor acting upstream. But perhaps the conclusion disregards the upstream and focuses on the hierarchy. Regardless, from the data, G2 is the key gene, and combining with it dies.

In epistasis terms, since g1g2 double has phenotype of g2, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g3g2 double has phene of g2, so G2 epistatic to G3.

And the g1g3 double has worse phene than either, suggesting additive effect when G2 is functional.

So this indicates that G2 is epistatic (downstream) to both G1 and G3, meaning it functions later in the pathway. The transcription factor part just adds that it is a TF, so if G2 is TF, then acting downstream; but transcription factors can be downstream in pathways (eg, activating defense genes). The given that at least one is a TF upstream might be a red herring or maybe is intended that G2 is the TF and acting downstream.

Therefore, the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor acting downstream in the pathway, and both G1 and G3 act upstream to regulate G2's activity, which is essential for anthracnose resistance.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, let's try to figure out how these genes interact based on the data. So, the wild-type resistance is 100%, and the mutants have lower resistance. The problem states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. We need to determine the relationships between G1, G2, and G3.

First, let me list the data again to make sure I have it right:

- Wild type (control): 100% resistance.
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm. So knocking out any gene reduces resistance, but the extent varies. The biggest drop is in g2, which goes to 0%. Then g3 is half, and g1 is 75%. So G2 seems most critical because its knockout completely removes resistance. Maybe G2 is the main gene, and the others are modifiers?

But wait, the double mutants are even lower. For instance, g1g3 is worse (10%) than either single mutant (g1 at 75%, g3 at 50%). But when combining g1 and g3, it's not additive. 75% and 50% might multiply to 37.5%, but the actual is 10%, which is even lower. Not sure if that's a simple multiplicative effect.

But g2g3 is 0%, same as g2 alone. Similarly, g1g2 is 0%. So when either g1 or g3 is combined with g2, the resistance is as low as g2 alone. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Epistasis means that the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If G2 is downstream, then a knockout of G2 would mask the effects of other genes. But if G2 is upstream, then... Wait, the problem says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So maybe G2 is the upstream gene.

Wait, typically, if gene A is upstream of gene B, then knocking out A would prevent B from being expressed. So, if A is a transcription factor needed for B's expression, then the phenotype of a A knockout would be similar to a A;B double knockout. But here, in double knockouts involving g2 (like g1g2 or g2g3), the resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. So maybe G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Which would mean that G2 acts downstream. But wait, the transcription factor would be upstream. So there's a contradiction here.

Wait, let's consider that a transcription factor acts upstream. So if G2 is the transcription factor, then knocking it out would disable all downstream genes. So say G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. Then in g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed, leading to 0%. But in the double mutants like g1g3, if G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, then even in the double knockout, since G2 is wild type, their presence or absence might not matter. But that's conflicting with the data because g1g3 has lower resistance than each single mutant.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, both contributing to resistance, and G2 is part of both pathways. For example, if G2 is required for both G1 and G3. Then, in g2 mutant, both pathways are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. If you knock out G1, then you only block its pathway, leaving G3's pathway active (but needing G2). Wait, but in that case, if G1 is knocked out, then resistance would be whatever G3's contribution is, but if G2 is required for G3, then in G1 knockout, G3 can still function, provided G2 is present. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, suppose that the pathway is linear. Let's try a hierarchical approach. If G2 is upstream, then it activates both G1 and G3. So in wild type, G2 activates G1 and G3, which then contribute to resistance. But that might not fit with the data.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then in g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed. Then, the resistance would be 0% (which matches the data for g2). But in g1 mutant, if G2 is functional, then G3 is expressed (since it's upstream). The resistance in g1 is 75%. Then G1 isn't required, but it contributes 25% of the resistance? Similarly, g3 is 50%. So if both G1 and G3 contribute when G2 is active, then perhaps total resistance is additive. So wild type: G2 active, so both G1 and G3 contribute. In g1, G3 is still active (because G2 is okay), so maybe you're missing G1's contribution. Wait, but the data says g1 has 75% resistance. That would imply that G1 contributes 25% (since 100% - 25% = 75%). Similarly, g3 has 50%, so G3 contributes 50%. But in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, but if they're downstream of G2, which is functional, then their knockout would still leave nothing, so resistance would be 0%. But wait, the data says g1g3 is 10%. So that doesn't fit. Because if G1 and G3 are the only downstream genes of G2, then the double knockout would be 0%, but in reality, it's 10%. So maybe there's another pathway.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance, and they themselves depend on G2. For example, G2 is a transcription factor activating G1 and G3. So if G2 is not present, then neither G1 nor G3 are active. Then:

- Wild type: G2 active, G1 and G3 active. Resistance 100%.
- g2: both G1 and G3 inactive. Resistance 0% (matches data).
- g1: G3 active (since G2 is functional), resistance missing G1's part. Since g1 is 75%, that would imply that G1 contributes 25%, and G3 contributes 50% (since 25% loss). But if G1 and G3 are additive, then G1 is 25, G3 is 50, and maybe a baseline of 25 from something else, but that complicates.

Wait, but when combining g1 and g3 (the double mutant g1g3), their resistance is 10%. But if they both depend on G2 for their expression, then in the g1g3 mutant, even though G2 is functional, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so resistance would be 0% missing these two. But the data says g1g3 is 10%. That 10% could be part of a parallel pathway that doesn't involve G1 or G3, but the problem states that these are the candidate genes, so maybe the 10% is residual.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is acting downstream of G1 and G3. If G1 and G3 both regulate G2. So, for example, G1 and G3 activate G2. Then, knocking out G1 would reduce activation of G2, leading to lower G2 activity, and thus lower resistance. Similarly for G3. But if G2 is knocked out, then resistance is 0%, as in g2 and any double with g2.

But let's test this with the data.

If G1 and G3 regulate G2:

- In g1 mutant, G2 is only partially active (maybe due to G3 still working). So if G1 contributes 25% activation of G2, then knocking out G1 would lower G2's activity by 25%. If resistance is proportional to G2 activity, then the resistance would be 75%, which matches the data for g1. Similarly, g3's knockout would lower G2 activity by 50% (since g3 has 50% resistance), so G3 contributes 50% activation. Then in the double mutant g1g3, G2 would be 0 (100-25-50=25? No. Or maybe additive: g1 and g3 each reduce G2 activation. If without G1, G2 is at 75%, without G3, G2 is at 50%, then without both, G2 is at 25% (100 -25 -50=25? If additive). But then the resistance would be 25%, but the data for g1g3 is 10%. Hmm, maybe they are multiplicative. 0.75 *0.5 = 0.375, but the data is 10%? That's not matching. Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are both required for G2 function. For example, both G1 and G3 need to be active for G2 to work. But then in the absence of either, G2 doesn't work, which would result in g1 being 0%, which it is not. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is part of both the G1 and G3 pathways. Like, if there are parallel pathways where G1 needs G2 and G3 also needs G2. Wait, that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: the triple mutant (assuming there was one) would be 0%, but since we don't have that. The key maybe is that in the double mutants with

# Anthropic completion

Let's analyze the gene interactions based on the provided data. We need to understand how G1, G2, and G3 relate to each other, knowing that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream.

Reviewing the resistance data:
- Wild type: 100% resistance
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The single mutant data shows varying impacts on resistance. G2's knockout has the most dramatic effect, reducing resistance to zero. G3's knockout reduces resistance to half, while G1's knockout has the least impact at 75% remaining resistance. This suggests G2 plays a critical role in the resistance mechanism.

Looking at the double mutants provides more insight. Both g2g3 and g1g2 show 0% resistance, identical to the g2 single mutant. This suggests G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. When G2 is knocked out, it doesn't matter if G1 or G3 are present or absent - resistance is always zero.

Interestingly, the g1g3 double mutant shows 10% resistance, which is lower than either single mutant alone (g1 at 75%, g3 at 50%). This isn't a simple additive or multiplicative effect. If it were multiplicative, we might expect 0.75 × 0.50 = 37.5% resistance, but we observe only 10%.

If G2 is the upstream transcription factor, knocking it out would prevent expression of downstream genes, explaining why g2 mutants and any double mutants involving g2 have 0% resistance. However, this doesn't fully explain the g1g3 double mutant data.

Perhaps G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways that both require G2, but also interact with each other. In this model, G2 activates both G1 and G3, explaining why g2 knockout eliminates all resistance. The partial resistance in g1 (75%) suggests G1 contributes 25% to the total resistance, while g3 (50%) suggests G3 contributes 50%. 

The g1g3 double mutant's 10% resistance complicates the picture. If G1 and G3 were simply additive and the only downstream elements of G2, we'd expect 0% resistance when both are knocked out. The 10% residual resistance might indicate another pathway or mechanism not fully captured in our model.

Alternatively, G2 might be downstream of G1 and G3, with both genes regulating G2's activity. In this scenario, g1 knockout would partially reduce G2 activity, leading to 75% resistance, while g3 knockout would reduce it more significantly to 50%. However, this model struggles to explain the g1g3 double mutant resistance of only 10%.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, let's examine how these genes interact using the given data. The resistance in the wild-type condition is 100%, whereas it decreases in the mutants. The challenge indicates that at least one gene functions as a transcription factor upstream. Let's explore the relationships among G1, G2, and G3.

Here's the data recap:

- Wild type (control): 100% resistance.
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The knockout of any gene reduces resistance, with the most significant drop seen in g2, which becomes 0%. This suggests G2 is crucial since its removal entirely abolishes resistance. It could mean G2 is the primary gene while the others modify its effects.

However, double mutants show even lower resistance. For instance, g1g3 has 10%, less than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone—not simply additive, as 75% and 50% would suggest 37.5%, yet it’s 10%. 

The double mutants g2g3 and g1g2 each register at 0%, like g2 alone, indicating G2 could be epistatic to G1 and G3. Epistasis refers to the effect of one gene masking the effects of another. If G2 were downstream, its knockout could conceal the influence of other genes. But, the problem specifies an upstream transcription factor. Maybe G2 is that factor.

Typically, if gene A is upstream of B, knocking out A would prevent B's expression. A similar phenotype in an A knockout and an A;B knockout would occur. But here, with g1g2 and g2g3 both being 0%, the result matches g2 alone. It suggests G2 might be epistatic to G1 and G3, implying G2 acts downstream. Yet, an upstream transcription factor should be involved.

Assuming G2 is a transcription factor, its deletion might disable all downstream genes. If G2 is upstream of G1 and G3, a g2 mutant would lead to 0% resistance as neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. In double mutants like g1g3, with G1 and G3 downstream of G2, their absence shouldn't matter if G2 is wild type. However, this contradicts the data, as g1g3 results in lower resistance than the individual mutants.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 might operate in parallel pathways that contribute to resistance, both requiring G2. If G2 supports both pathways, a g2 mutant would make resistance 0%. A g1 mutation would leave G3’s pathway active, needing G2, implying its contribution continues if G2 is functioning. Yet, this approach leads to confusion.

A hierarchical model might work: G2 is upstream, activating both G1 and G3. In this setup:

- Wild type: All active, 100% resistance.
- g2: Inactive G1 and G3, 0% resistance—fitting the data.
- g1: With G3 active (G2 is functional), resistance is missing G1’s contribution. With 75% resistance, G1 seemingly adds 25%, and G3 contributes 50%.

But, with g1g3 at only 10%, if G1 and G3 were the only downstream genes, resistance should be 0%. Thus, another pathway might exist.

Alternatively, if G2 is downstream, G1 and G3 could regulate it. Knocking out G1 reduces G2 activation slightly due to G3 activity, while inactivating G3 reduces it more significantly—yet this does not completely align with the data.

In summary, perhaps G2 acts in both G1 and G3 pathways, essential for both. G1 and G3 might additively contribute, each dependent on G2. This scenario could help explain the single mutants’ partial resistance. But an explanation for the double mutants showing 10% remains elusive, suggesting a possible unexplained pathway or residual activity.

Which matches the data: g2, g1g2, g2g3 all 0%. So in all those cases, if G2 is non-functional, resistance is 0%. Now, the remaining mutants: g1, g3, and g1g3.\n\nIn g1 (75%), g3 (50%), and double is 10%. So if G1 and G3 are partially redundant or additive. If the resistance when both are present is 100%, but individually they contribute 75 and 50. But how does the double knockout work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe they function in separate pathways where each contributes something. For example, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%, and together there is another 25% from G2. But in the double mutant g1g3, only the G2 contribution (25%) is left, but the actual is 10%. Hmm, maybe not. Or maybe their contributions aren't additive. Let's think of it as combining the mutations. If the presence of each gene adds some level of resistance, but when both are absent, there's a non-linear effect.\n\nBut given that g1g3 is 10%, which is less than the product of 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375 (37.5%), which is still much higher than 10%, which is very low. So maybe the two genes are in a pathway where the presence of one can compensate for the other, but when both are missing, it's way worse. Alternatively, maybe they function in a synergistic way, but the numbers don't exactly add up.\n\nAlternatively, there's another angle. Since G2 is the one where knocking out causes total loss (0%), and when combined with any other gene, it's still 0%, this suggests that G2 is epistatic to the others. That is, the function of G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. So even if G1 and G3 are functional, if G2 is not, then no resistance. But in the case of knocking out G1 or G3, since G2 is still functional, their individual contributions are still possible.\n\nSo, if G2 is a transcription factor that regulates G1 and G3, but G1 and G3 add their own contributions. Wait, but if G2 is upstream and required for G1 and G3 expression, then in a g1 mutant, G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed. So resistance in g1 mutant would be whatever G3 contributes. But the data says g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. If G1's expression is not dependent on G2, but they are in separate pathways. Then perhaps G2's own contribution is separate.\n\nAlternatively, it's a signaling cascade where G2 is at the top. For example: G2 activates some process that both G1 and G3 depend on. But then without G2, G1 and G3 can't function, which brings resistance to 0%. But that's not the case because in g1 and g3 mutants, their resistances are reduced but not zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the pathways are more complex. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nFirst, g2 knockout has the most severe phenotype (0%), suggesting it's the most critical gene. The fact that any double mutant with g2 (g1g2, g2g3) also is 0% suggests that G2 is essential for any resistance. Therefore, G2's product is necessary for the functioning of G1 and/or G3. So, without G2, even if G1 or G3 are present, they can't contribute. But when G2 is present, the other genes (G1 and G3) add to the resistance.\n\nIn other words, G2 is required for the baseline resistance, and G1 and G3 enhance that resistance. Let's see:\n\nIf G2 provides the base level. For example, G2 provides 50% resistance, and G1 adds 25% (total 75%), and G3 adds another 25% (total 75% +25%?), but that doesn't align with the data.\n\nAlternatively, G2 is part of a pathway that's responsible for 100% resistance, but G1 and G3 modulate it. For example, if G2 is necessary for resistance, and G1 and G3 enhance it. So without G2, nothing. With G2, but without G1, you get 75%, which suggests G1 contributes 25%. With G2 but without G3, you get 50%, so G3 contributes 50%. And with both G1 and G3 knocked out, you only have G2, but not enough, leading to 10%? That doesn't add up, since G2 is present but why would losing G1 and G3 in the presence of G2 lead to lower resistance? If G2 is the main contributor, then maybe the combined effect of knocking out G1 and G3 would lead to their parts being lost, but since G2 is present, maybe part of the resistance is retained. Wait, but in the case of g1g3 double mutant, even though G2 is present (since it's not knocked out), resistance is 10%. So it's possible that G2 needs G1 and G3 to function. So maybe G2 is dependent on G1 and G3. For example, G2 is part of a complex with G1 and G3, and without either, G2 can't function properly. So in the double mutant, even though G2 is present, it's not functional without G1 and G3. But then, the g1 or g3 single mutants should have lower resistance, but in the data, g1 has 75% and g3 50% when G2 is present. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, G2 is downstream and integrates signals from G1 and G3. So, for full resistance, you need both G1 and G3 to activate G2. Then, in the case of knocking out G1 or G3, G2's activity is reduced. For example, G1 contributes X to activate G2, G3 contributes Y. Then in the single mutants, G2 activity is X or Y, and in double mutant, it's 0 (if additive). But let's see:\n\nIf G2 is downstream and requires both G1 and G3 for full activation:\n\n- Wild type: G1 and G3 active, so G2 is fully active. 100% resistance.\n- g1: G2 activity dependent only on G3 (50% maybe), giving 50%. But the data says g1 is 75%.\n- g3: G2 activity dependent only on G1 (maybe 25%, leading to 75%). But in data, g3 is 50%.\n- So maybe not directly additive.\n\nThis isn't matching. Let's consider an alternative epistatic relationship.\n\nIf G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, that would mean that G2's function is required for the phenotypes of G1 and G3. For example, if G2 is downstream, then the function of G1 and G3 depend on G2. But in that case, knocking out G2 would lead to a more severe phenotype than either G1 or G3, which it does (g2 is 0%). However, when G2 is present (as in g1, g3 mutants), their individual knockouts reduce resistance but not by all. So, perhaps G1 and G3 act upstream of G2, but also have their own independent pathways. This is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet's try the possible hierarchy where G2 is a transcription factor required for the expression of G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But if that were true, then in a g1 mutant (where G2 is present), G3 is still expressed. So resistance in g1 would be dependent on G2 and G3. But g1 has 75%. Hmm. Maybe the presence of G2 allows for G3 to be expressed, providing some resistance. Similarly, G1 might not be dependent on G2. But if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, perhaps only G3 is downstream. Then, in g2 mutant, G3 isn't expressed. So the resistance in g2 is 0%, which accounts for that mutant. Meanwhile, in g3 mutant (G2 present but G3 not), resistance would be some lower value. Maybe G1 is expressed if its expression doesn't require G2. But how does G1 contribute to resistance?\n\nWait, maybe G2 is upstream of G3, but G1 is independent. So:\n\n- G2 → G3 → resistance pathway\n\nAnd G1 works in a separate pathway.\n\nSo, in wild type:\n\n- G3 is expressed (since G2 is working) contributing to resistance, and G1 contributes some amount. So total resistance is G1 + G2-dependent G3.\n\nBut then if you knock out G2 (g2), G3 is not expressed. The resistance would then be whatever G1 contributes. But according to data, g2 has 0% resistance. So that would mean that G1's contribution is nothing? That can't be, because g1 has 75% resistance, suggesting G1 normally contributes 25% (100-75=25). Wait, but in g2 knockout, if G3 isn't expressed, then only the G1's contribution remains (25%), but data says g2 knockout is 0%. So that contradicts. Unless G1's expression also requires G2.\n\nSo, if both G1 and G3 require G2 for their expression. Then:\n\n- Wild type: G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance.\n- g2 mutant: Both G1 and G3 not expressed. Resistance 0%.\n- g1 mutant: G2 and G3 active. Resistance depends on G2 and G3. But in the data, g1 has 75%. If G3's contribution is 75%, then maybe. But then g3 mutant would have G2 and G1 active, which should give higher resistance. But data says g3 mutant is 50%.\n\nAlternatively, if with G1 knocked out (but G3 active via G2), the resistance would be G3's contribution. If G3 alone provides 75%, but the data says g1 is 75%, but the wild type is 100%. So maybe G3 and G1 still are additive? I'm getting lost.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as G2 being a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, which in turn act in separate pathways. Then:\n\n- Resistance = G1 activity + G3 activity.\n\nG1 and G3 are both activated by G2. So, if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are 0 → total resistance 0% (matches g2 mutant).\n\nIf G1 is knocked out, but G2 and G3 are active: G3's activity is dependent on G2, which is present. So resistance is G3's contribution. But data says g1 has 75%. So perhaps G3 provides 75%, but in the wild type, G1 adds 25% (total 100%). Then, in g3 mutant (G3 knocked out), resistance would be G1's 25%. However, in data, g3 is 50%, which contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contributions are multiplicative. For instance, G1 and G3 are both needed for each other's functions. So, without G1, G3's effectiveness is reduced, and vice versa. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, G2 is upstream of G1, and G3 is downstream of G1. So:\n\nG2 → G1 → G3 → resistance.\n\nThen:\n\n- g2: G1 and G3 not active. Resistance 0% (matches).\n- g1: G3 not active (since G1 is upstream). Resistance 0%, but data says g1 has 75%. Doesn't fit.\nSo that seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, G2 → G3 → resistance, and G1 is in a separate pathway.\n\nBut then, g2 mutant removes G3's contribution, but if G1 is still active, resistance should be whatever G1 contributes. But data says g2 is 0%, so G1's contribution would have to be 0% as well, which contradicts g1 being 75%.\n\nI need to approach this differently. Let's consider that there might be an epistatic relationship.\n\nIf the question is stating that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, which is most likely G2 since its knockout has the most severe effect. So G2 is the transcription factor controlling others.\n\nSo, suppose G2 is upstream and regulates both G1 and G3, which are downstream genes. So in the wild type, G2 is active, which allows G1 and G3 to function. If G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, so resistance drops to 0. But if G1 or G3 are knocked out individually, and G2 is present, then other downstream genes can still function. Let's see:\n\nIn g1 mutant (G2 active, but G1 not), G3 is still active (since G2 is present). So the resistance is due to G3. But in data, g1 is 75%. So maybe G3 alone contributes 75%, and G1 and G3 together contribute 100%? But then what's g3's resistance?\n\nIf G3 is knocked out (g3 mutant), resistance is whatever G1 contributes (e.g., 50%). But in this model, wild type is G1 + G3 = 100%; so G1 would be 50% and G3 is 50%, adding up. But then:\n\n- g1: G3 is 50% → resistance 50%. But data says g1 is 75%. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the absence of G1, G3 is upregulated. But that's too speculative.\n\nAnother angle: Look at the double mutants. The double mutant g1g3 is 10% resistant. So in the absence of both G1 and G3, but G2 is functional. How is that possible? If G2 is upstream, then its activity should not depend on G1 and G3. The 10% might be a residual effect, but maybe there's another gene involved. However, we only have G1, G2, G3 as candidates. So perhaps G2 has a minor function independent of G1 and G3, providing 10% resistance. But then, in the single mutant G2, resistance is 0%, which would mean that even that minor function is disabled. But the only time we see 10% is in g1g3, not when G2 is present. So maybe the 10% is due to a partial function of G2 in the absence of G1 and G3. But I can't see a straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, if G2 is the main gene required, and works synergistically with G1 and G3. When G2 is present, knocking out G1 or G3 only partially reduces resistance, but when both are gone, even G2 isn't enough, so resistance is very low. But why would g1g3 have 10%? Maybe in the absence of G1 and G3, a small part of G2's function remains.\n\nWait, considering the resistance percentages:\n\nWild type: 100% (G1, G2, G3)\n\ng1: 75% (missing G1)\ng3: 50% (missing G3)\ng2: 0% (missing G2)\n\nIf we arrange the pathway as G2 being the main component, and G1 and G3 enhancing G2's function.\n\nFor example, G2 has a base activity, and G1 and G3 each increase its activity:\n\nWild type: G2 (base) at 50%, plus G1 adds 25%, and G3 adds 25% → total 100%.\n\nIf G1 is knocked out: base + G3 → 50% + 25% =75% (matches g1)\nIf G3 is knocked out: base + G1 →50%+25%=75% → but data says g3 is 50%. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, G2's base is higher. Suppose G2's base is 30%, G1 adds 50%, and G3 adds 20%. Then:\n\n- Wild type: 100%\n- g1: 30% +20% =50% (but g3 is 50% in data)\n- g3: 30%+50% =80% (but data) Doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the combination is multiplicative. Maybe G2's function is necessary, and G1 and G3 modify it. \n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear way to model it. Let's go back to the problem's statement: which conclusion can we draw?\n\nThe question mentions that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Based on the data, G2's knockout gives the most severe phenotype, suggesting it's an upstream controller. The fact that double mutants with G2 (g1g2, g2g3) are just as bad as g2 suggests that G2 is epistatic to others. That is, the function of G2 is necessary for the function of G1 and G3. So a epistatic interaction where G2 is required for G1 and G3's functions. \n\nIf G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then knocking out G2 would render G1 and G3 non-functional. However, when G2 is present (as in the single mutants g1 and g3), their individual knockouts show reduced resistance. This suggests that G1 and G3 are partially redundant pathways downstream of G2.\n\nSo, in this scenario: pathogen resistance is primarily controlled by G2, which activates two separate pathways involving G1 and G3. Each pathway contributes to resistance, and their combined activity gives full resistance. If one pathway is disrupted (g1 or g3), resistance is reduced by the respective pathway's contribution. \n\nHowever, in the double mutant g1g3, both pathways are disabled, leading to much lower resistance (10%), but since G2 is still active, maybe there's a tiny residual function. \n\nThe key point is that G2 is upstream and required for any meaningful resistance (thus, if G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0% regardless of others), while G1 and G3 function downstream of G2 and contribute additively. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of both G1 and G3, which contribute additively to the resistance pathway. Because the double mutants of g1 and g3 (g1g3) have a much lower resistance than either single mutant, it supports that they function in separate pathways enhancing resistance downstream of G2.

From the experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the genetic interactions:

1. **G2 is a critical upstream regulator (likely the transcription factor)**.  
   - The complete loss of resistance in *g2* (0%) and all double mutants involving *g2* (*g1g2*, *g2g3*) indicates that **G2 is essential for initiating resistance**. Its absence nullifies contributions from other genes.  
   - This places G2 **epistatic** to G1 and G3, meaning G2’s function is required for G1 and G3 to influence resistance.

2. **G1 and G3 function in partially redundant pathways downstream of G2**.  
   - Single mutants *g1* (75%) and *g3* (50%) retain partial resistance, showing that G1 and G3 individually contribute to resistance *when G2 is active*.  
   - The additive effect of their loss in the *g1g3* double mutant (10%, much lower than either single mutant) suggests they act in **distinct pathways** that synergize to amplify resistance downstream of G2.  

3. **Hierarchical interaction model**:  
   - **G2** acts as the upstream transcription factor, activating or enabling pathways involving **G1** and **G3**.  
   - **G1** and **G3** function in parallel, additive pathways that enhance resistance beyond the baseline provided by G2 (though the *g1g3* residual 10% implies minor redundant or independent contributions from G2 alone).

**Conclusion:**  
**G2 is an essential transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, which operate in additive pathways to confer anthracnose resistance.** The severe phenotype of *g2* mutants and the epistatic relationships in double mutants confirm G2’s hierarchical dominance, while G1 and G3 act in complementary roles to amplify resistance downstream.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

0%, those gene combinations are critical. So g1g2, g2g3, g1g3 all at 0% except for g1g3 at 10%. Wait, according to data, g1g3 is 10%, others are 0%. So maybe:

If G2 is required for any resistance, then mutants with g2 will be 0%. Which matches the data: g2, g1g2, g2g3 all 0%. So in all those cases, if G2 is non-functional, resistance is 0%. Now, the remaining mutants: g1, g3, and g1g3.

In g1 (75%), g3 (50%), and double is 10%. So if G1 and G3 are partially redundant or additive. If the resistance when both are present is 100%, but individually they contribute 75 and 50. But how does the double knockout work?

Alternatively, maybe they function in separate pathways where each contributes something. For example, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%, and together there is another 25% from G2. But in the double mutant g1g3, only the G2 contribution (25%) is left, but the actual is 10%. Hmm, maybe not. Or maybe their contributions aren't additive. Let's think of it as combining the mutations. If the presence of each gene adds some level of resistance, but when both are absent, there's a non-linear effect.

But given that g1g3 is 10%, which is less than the product of 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375 (37.5%), which is still much higher than 10%, which is very low. So maybe the two genes are in a pathway where the presence of one can compensate for the other, but when both are missing, it's way worse. Alternatively, maybe they function in a synergistic way, but the numbers don't exactly add up.

Alternatively, there's another angle. Since G2 is the one where knocking out causes total loss (0%), and when combined with any other gene, it's still 0%, this suggests that G2 is epistatic to the others. That is, the function of G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3. So even if G1 and G3 are functional, if G2 is not, then no resistance. But in the case of knocking out G1 or G3, since G2 is still functional, their individual contributions are still possible.

So, if G2 is a transcription factor that regulates G1 and G3, but G1 and G3 add their own contributions. Wait, but if G2 is upstream and required for G1 and G3 expression, then in a g1 mutant, G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed. So resistance in g1 mutant would be whatever G3 contributes. But the data says g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. If G1's expression is not dependent on G2, but they are in separate pathways. Then perhaps G2's own contribution is separate.

Alternatively, it's a signaling cascade where G2 is at the top. For example: G2 activates some process that both G1 and G3 depend on. But then without G2, G1 and G3 can't function, which brings resistance to 0%. But that's not the case because in g1 and g3 mutants, their resistances are reduced but not zero.

Wait, perhaps the pathways are more complex. Let me try to think step by step.

First, g2 knockout has the most severe phenotype (0%), suggesting it's the most critical gene. The fact that any double mutant with g2 (g1g2, g2g3) also is 0% suggests that G2 is essential for any resistance. Therefore, G2's product is necessary for the functioning of G1 and/or G3. So, without G2, even if G1 or G3 are present, they can't contribute. But when G2 is present, the other genes (G1 and G3) add to the resistance.

In other words, G2 is required for the baseline resistance, and G1 and G3 enhance that resistance. Let's see:

If G2 provides the base level. For example, G2 provides 50% resistance, and G1 adds 25% (total 75%), and G3 adds another 25% (total 75% +25%?), but that doesn't align with the data.

Alternatively, G2 is part of a pathway that's responsible for 100% resistance, but G1 and G3 modulate it. For example, if G2 is necessary for resistance, and G1 and G3 enhance it. So without G2, nothing. With G2, but without G1, you get 75%, which suggests G1 contributes 25%. With G2 but without G3, you get 50%, so G3 contributes 50%. And with both G1 and G3 knocked out, you only have G2, but not enough, leading to 10%? That doesn't add up, since G2 is present but why would losing G1 and G3 in the presence of G2 lead to lower resistance? If G2 is the main contributor, then maybe the combined effect of knocking out G1 and G3 would lead to their parts being lost, but since G2 is present, maybe part of the resistance is retained. Wait, but in the case of g1g3 double mutant, even though G2 is present (since it's not knocked out), resistance is 10%. So it's possible that G2 needs G1 and G3 to function. So maybe G2 is dependent on G1 and G3. For example, G2 is part of a complex with G1 and G3, and without either, G2 can't function properly. So in the double mutant, even though G2 is present, it's not functional without G1 and G3. But then, the g1 or g3 single mutants should have lower resistance, but in the data, g1 has 75% and g3 50% when G2 is present. So maybe not.

Alternatively, G2 is downstream and integrates signals from G1 and G3. So, for full resistance, you need both G1 and G3 to activate G2. Then, in the case of knocking out G1 or G3, G2's activity is reduced. For example, G1 contributes X to activate G2, G3 contributes Y. Then in the single mutants, G2 activity is X or Y, and in double mutant, it's 0 (if additive). But let's see:

If G2 is downstream and requires both G1 and G3 for full activation:

- Wild type: G1 and G3 active, so G2 is fully active. 100% resistance.
- g1: G2 activity dependent only on G3 (50% maybe), giving 50%. But the data says g1 is 75%.
- g3: G2 activity dependent only on G1 (maybe 25%, leading to 75%). But in data, g3 is 50%.
- So maybe not directly additive.

This isn't matching. Let's consider an alternative epistatic relationship.

If G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, that would mean that G2's function is required for the phenotypes of G1 and G3. For example, if G2 is downstream, then the function of G1 and G3 depend on G2. But in that case, knocking out G2 would lead to a more severe phenotype than either G1 or G3, which it does (g2 is 0%). However, when G2 is present (as in g1, g3 mutants), their individual knockouts reduce resistance but not by all. So, perhaps G1 and G3 act upstream of G2, but also have their own independent pathways. This is getting a bit confusing.

Let's try the possible hierarchy where G2 is a transcription factor required for the expression of G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But if that were true, then in a g1 mutant (where G2 is present), G3 is still expressed. So resistance in g1 would be dependent on G2 and G3. But g1 has 75%. Hmm. Maybe the presence of G2 allows for G3 to be expressed, providing some resistance. Similarly, G1 might not be dependent on G2. But if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, perhaps only G3 is downstream. Then, in g2 mutant, G3 isn't expressed. So the resistance in g2 is 0%, which accounts for that mutant. Meanwhile, in g3 mutant (G2 present but G3 not), resistance would be some lower value. Maybe G1 is expressed if its expression doesn't require G2. But how does G1 contribute to resistance?

Wait, maybe G2 is upstream of G3, but G1 is independent. So:

- G2 → G3 → resistance pathway

And G1 works in a separate pathway.

So, in wild type:

- G3 is expressed (since G2 is working) contributing to resistance, and G1 contributes some amount. So total resistance is G1 + G2-dependent G3.

But then if you knock out G2 (g2), G3 is not expressed. The resistance would then be whatever G1 contributes. But according to data, g2 has 0% resistance. So that would mean that G1's contribution is nothing? That can't be, because g1 has 75% resistance, suggesting G1 normally contributes 25% (100-75=25). Wait, but in g2 knockout, if G3 isn't expressed, then only the G1's contribution remains (25%), but data says g2 knockout is 0%. So that contradicts. Unless G1's expression also requires G2.

So, if both G1 and G3 require G2 for their expression. Then:

- Wild type: G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance.
- g2 mutant: Both G1 and G3 not expressed. Resistance 0%.
- g1 mutant: G2 and G3 active. Resistance depends on G2 and G3. But in the data, g1 has 75%. If G3's contribution is 75%, then maybe. But then g3 mutant would have G2 and G1 active, which should give higher resistance. But data says g3 mutant is 50%.

Alternatively, if with G1 knocked out (but G3 active via G2), the resistance would be G3's contribution. If G3 alone provides 75%, but the data says g1 is 75%, but the wild type is 100%. So maybe G3 and G1 still are additive? I'm getting lost.

Alternatively, think of it as G2 being a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3, which in turn act in separate pathways. Then:

- Resistance = G1 activity + G3 activity.

G1 and G3 are both activated by G2. So, if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 are 0 → total resistance 0% (matches g2 mutant).

If G1 is knocked out, but G2 and G3 are active: G3's activity is dependent on G2, which is present. So resistance is G3's contribution. But data says g1 has 75%. So perhaps G3 provides 75%, but in the wild type, G1 adds 25% (total 100%). Then, in g3 mutant (G3 knocked out), resistance would be G1's 25%. However, in data, g3 is 50%, which contradicts.

Alternatively, maybe the contributions are multiplicative. For instance, G1 and G3 are both needed for each other's functions. So, without G1, G3's effectiveness is reduced, and vice versa. But it's unclear.

Alternatively, G2 is upstream of G1, and G3 is downstream of G1. So:

G2 → G1 → G3 → resistance.

Then:

- g2: G1 and G3 not active. Resistance 0% (matches).
- g1: G3 not active (since G1 is upstream). Resistance 0%, but data says g1 has 75%. Doesn't fit.
So that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, G2 → G3 → resistance, and G1 is in a separate pathway.

But then, g2 mutant removes G3's contribution, but if G1 is still active, resistance should be whatever G1 contributes. But data says g2 is 0%, so G1's contribution would have to be 0% as well, which contradicts g1 being 75%.

I need to approach this differently. Let's consider that there might be an epistatic relationship.

If the question is stating that one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream, which is most likely G2 since its knockout has the most severe effect. So G2 is the transcription factor controlling others.

So, suppose G2 is upstream and regulates both G1 and G3, which are downstream genes. So in the wild type, G2 is active, which allows G1 and G3 to function. If G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, so resistance drops to 0. But if G1 or G3 are knocked out individually, and G2 is present, then other downstream genes can still function. Let's see:

In g1 mutant (G2 active, but G1 not), G3 is still active (since G2 is present). So the resistance is due to G3. But in data, g1 is 75%. So maybe G3 alone contributes 75%, and G1 and G3 together contribute 100%? But then what's g3's resistance?

If G3 is knocked out (g3 mutant), resistance is whatever G1 contributes (e.g., 50%). But in this model, wild type is G1 + G3 = 100%; so G1 would be 50% and G3 is 50%, adding up. But then:

- g1: G3 is 50% → resistance 50%. But data says g1 is 75%. Doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe in the absence of G1, G3 is upregulated. But that's too speculative.

Another angle: Look at the double mutants. The double mutant g1g3 is 10% resistant. So in the absence of both G1 and G3, but G2 is functional. How is that possible? If G2 is upstream, then its activity should not depend on G1 and G3. The 10% might be a residual effect, but maybe there's another gene involved. However, we only have G1, G2, G3 as candidates. So perhaps G2 has a minor function independent of G1 and G3, providing 10% resistance. But then, in the single mutant G2, resistance is 0%, which would mean that even that minor function is disabled. But the only time we see 10% is in g1g3, not when G2 is present. So maybe the 10% is due to a partial function of G2 in the absence of G1 and G3. But I can't see a straightforward way.

Alternatively, if G2 is the main gene required, and works synergistically with G1 and G3. When G2 is present, knocking out G1 or G3 only partially reduces resistance, but when both are gone, even G2 isn't enough, so resistance is very low. But why would g1g3 have 10%? Maybe in the absence of G1 and G3, a small part of G2's function remains.

Wait, considering the resistance percentages:

Wild type: 100% (G1, G2, G3)

g1: 75% (missing G1)
g3: 50% (missing G3)
g2: 0% (missing G2)

If we arrange the pathway as G2 being the main component, and G1 and G3 enhancing G2's function.

For example, G2 has a base activity, and G1 and G3 each increase its activity:

Wild type: G2 (base) at 50%, plus G1 adds 25%, and G3 adds 25% → total 100%.

If G1 is knocked out: base + G3 → 50% + 25% =75% (matches g1)
If G3 is knocked out: base + G1 →50%+25%=75% → but data says g3 is 50%. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G2's base is higher. Suppose G2's base is 30%, G1 adds 50%, and G3 adds 20%. Then:

- Wild type: 100%
- g1: 30% +20% =50% (but g3 is 50% in data)
- g3: 30%+50% =80% (but data) Doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the combination is multiplicative. Maybe G2's function is necessary, and G1 and G3 modify it. 

But I'm not seeing a clear way to model it. Let's go back to the problem's statement: which conclusion can we draw?

The question mentions that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Based on the data, G2's knockout gives the most severe phenotype, suggesting it's an upstream controller. The fact that double mutants with G2 (g1g2, g2g3) are just as bad as g2 suggests that G2 is epistatic to others. That is, the function of G2 is necessary for the function of G1 and G3. So a epistatic interaction where G2 is required for G1 and G3's functions. 

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then knocking out G2 would render G1 and G3 non-functional. However, when G2 is present (as in the single mutants g1 and g3), their individual knockouts show reduced resistance. This suggests that G1 and G3 are partially redundant pathways downstream of G2.

So, in this scenario: pathogen resistance is primarily controlled by G2, which activates two separate pathways involving G1 and G3. Each pathway contributes to resistance, and their combined activity gives full resistance. If one pathway is disrupted (g1 or g3), resistance is reduced by the respective pathway's contribution. 

However, in the double mutant g1g3, both pathways are disabled, leading to much lower resistance (10%), but since G2 is still active, maybe there's a tiny residual function. 

The key point is that G2 is upstream and required for any meaningful resistance (thus, if G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0% regardless of others), while G1 and G3 function downstream of G2 and contribute additively. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of both G1 and G3, which contribute additively to the resistance pathway. Because the double mutants of g1 and g3 (g1g3) have a much lower resistance than either single mutant, it supports that they function in separate pathways enhancing resistance downstream of G2. Also, since any double mutant with g2 is 0%, confirms that G2 is epistatic to others.

Based on the experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the genetic interactions:

1. **G2 is the upstream transcription factor**:  
   - The **g2** mutant (0% resistance) shows the most severe phenotype in single mutants, indicating G2 is indispensable for resistance.  
   - All double mutants involving **g2** (g1g2, g2g3) also show 0% resistance, confirming that loss of **G2** masks any contribution from other genes. This **epistatic relationship** places **G2** upstream of **G1** and **G3**.

2. **G1 and G3 act downstream of G2 in a partially redundant or additive pathway**:  
   - The **g1** mutant (75% resistance) and **g3** mutant (50% resistance) retain partial resistance, suggesting both contribute to the pathway triggered by **G2**.  
   - The **g1g3** double mutant (10% resistance) shows **synergistic reduction** in resistance, stronger than additive effects (expected 37.5% if independent). This implies **G1 and G3 interact** functionally (e.g., amplifying each other’s output) but are still dependent on **G2**.

3. **Model of hierarchy**:  
   - **G2** (transcription factor) activates **G1** and **G3**, which act in parallel or intersecting pathways to confer resistance.  
   - Residual resistance in **g1g3** suggests a minor, **G2-independent pathway** (10%), but the primary mechanism requires **G2** and its downstream targets **G1** and **G3**.  

**Conclusion**:  
G2 is the master transcription factor controlling resistance, while G1 and G3 are downstream components whose combined contributions amplify the resistance signal. The severe loss of resistance in double mutants with **g2** confirms its dominant upstream role.

Another possibility is that G2 acts upstream, G3 is downstream of G2, and G1 is part of an independent pathway. In this case, g2 affects only the G3 pathway (explaining the 0% resistance in g2), while G1's pathway contributes 25% (as g1 is 75%). But the 10% resistance in g1g3 would imply interaction between the pathways, which isn't fully additive.

Considering that at least one gene is a transcription factor (which typically acts upstream), and given that G2's knockout has the most severe phenotype, G2 is likely the transcription factor controlling both G1 and G3. The residual resistance in g1 and g3 mutants suggests that they are partially redundant downstream targets of G2. The more severe effect in g1g3 than the sum of their individual effects points to an interaction where their pathways overlap or amplify each other's outputs beyond simple addition, but the key hierarchy centers on G2 as the primary regulator.

From the experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn about the interaction between G1, G2, and G3 in anthracnose resistance:

1. **G2 is the critical transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3**.  
   - The **g2** mutant (0% resistance) shows no resistance, indicating G2 is essential for the pathway.  
   - In contrast, **g1** (75%) and **g3** (50%) retain partial resistance, suggesting G1 and G3 modulate but are not indispensable to G2’s function.  

2. **G1 and G3 act upstream to regulate G2 activity**.  
   - The double mutants **g1g3** (10% resistance) exhibit a synthetic enhancement effect, where losing both upstream regulators (G1 and G3) severely reduces G2’s residual activity. This indicates G1 and G3 independently contribute to G2’s activation.  

3. **Epistatic relationships**:  
   - G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, as its knockout (g2) masks the effects of G1/G3 mutations (e.g., **g1g2** and **g2g3** mutants both show 0% resistance, identical to **g2** alone).  
   - This confirms **G2’s position downstream** in the pathway, acting as the central node controlling resistance.  

**Summary**: The hierarchy is **G1 and G3 → G2 → Resistance**, where G2 is the transcription factor executing the resistance response. G1 and G3 enhance G2’s activity but are not strictly required; their combined loss partially suppresses residual G2 function (10%). This explains why G2’s absence fully abolishes resistance (0%), while partial upstream defects reduce it proportionally.

Alternatively, redundancy between G1 and G3 exists but is incomplete. The presence of G1g3 double mutant having lower (10%) than either single mutant, which sum to 125% (75+50), thus showing a combined effect lowering it further than additive, could suggest negative interaction.

But perhaps synthetic lethality or a different epistatic interaction. Alternatively, G1 and G3 work in parallel pathways, each contributing some resistance. If G2 is in a separate pathway, but only when both G1 and G3 are disabled alongside, perhaps a third pathway involving G2 might still provide partial resistance, but in the double mutant?

Alternatively, let's consider that G2 is a key transcription factor. Therefore, in the absence of G2 (g2 mutant), resistance collapses entirely to 0%. If G1 and G3 are both in pathways that feed into G2, then loss of G1 or G3 would reduce the activation of G2. But this is contradicting, because if G2 is required as a transcription factor, then its absence would block downstream effects.

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 are interdependent. For instance, G1 modulates G3 expression or vice versa. If G1 is knocked out, G3's effectiveness reduces (and vice versa?), but G2's effect is still the primary.

Alternatively, G2 is regulated by G1 and G3. If G2 is upstream, it's active regardless. If G2 is downstream, then G1 and G3 both influence G2's expression or activity.

If G2 depends on G1 and G3 for its regulation, then:

- In wild type: G2 is fully active, leading to 100% resistance.
- In g1: G2 is less active (due to missing G1 input), so resistance is 75%.
- In g3: G2 is even less active (since G3 also contributes), hence 50% resistance.
- In g1g3: G2 may be minimally active, 10% resistance.
- If G2 is knocked out, regardless of G1 and G3 (g2, g2g3, g1g2), the resistance is 0%.

This model suggests that G2 is downstream and integrates signals from G1 and G3. Then, G1 and G3 each contribute positively to G2's activity. Therefore, the hierarchy is G1 and G3 → G2 → resistance.

This fits the data:

- When G2 is KO (g2), resistance is 0%.
- When G1 is KO (g1), G2’s activity is reduced, leading to 75% (so G1 provides 25% input to G2).
- When G3 is KO (g3), G2’s activity is lower, at 50% (so G3 provides 50%).
- When both G1 and G3 are KO (g1g3), G2’s activity is only 10%, perhaps from residual inputs not accounted for by G1 and G3, or non-linear effects.
- The double mutants where G2 is missing (g1g2, g2g3) cannot have any resistance because G2 is absent.

This makes sense and aligns with the given data. Therefore, G1 and G3 regulate the activity of G2, which is the transcription factor acting downstream. The problem stated that at least one gene acts as a transcription factor upstream of others. According to this, G2 would be downstream but is the transcription factor. Wait, but according to the above model, G2 would be downstream (receives input from G1 and G3) but then be considered upstream in a regulatory pathway for resistance.

Ah, perhaps in this hierarchy, G2 is the transcription factor that controls resistance genes. G1 and G3 may encode signaling components that activate G2. If that's the case, and knocking out G1 or G3 impairs G2's activation, leading to lower resistance. Then G2's own knockout essentially removes all resistance. Thus, the model supports G2 being downstream of G1 and G3. However, since the problem states at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream, which here could be G2 if the transcription factor is required to activate other resistance genes. But in this model, G1 and G3 activate G2, which in turn activates other genes.

Therefore, the conclusion could be that G2 is the transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3. But in the question's framework, it's stated that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So maybe G2 is the transcription factor acting upstream of some genes not mentioned, but the data suggests the tested genes G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. Alternatively, G2 is the transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3. But in that case, how does the data fit?

If G2 is a transcription factor activating G1 and G3, then:

- Knocking out G2 (g2) would prevent G1 and G3 expression. So the resistance should be low. The data shows g2 is 0%, which fits.
- However, the single mutants g1 and g3 (when G2 is active) would still have G3 or G1 active. The single mutant g1's resistance (75%) suggests that G3 (remaining active under G2's regulation) partially compensates, and similarly for g3 (50%).

But combining the knockouts (g1g3) when G2 is active would lead to both G1 and G3 missing, but in the data g1g3 resistance is 10%. If G2 is active but both its targets (G1 and G3) are knocked out, but resistance still depends on other genes that G2 might regulate. But here, the model might not fully explain.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 doesn't regulate G1 or G3, but all three are in separate pathways. But considering the epistatic interactions observed in double mutants, this seems less likely. The most consistent model is that G2 is the transcription factor required to activate resistance genes, and it is itself regulated by G1 and G3. So the hierarchy is G1/G3 → [activate] G2 → [activates] resistance genes.

Therefore, the key conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor acting downstream of G1 and G3 in the pathway. G1 and G3 positively regulate G2's activity in contributing to anthracnose resistance. When either G1 or G3 is knocked out, G2's activity is only partially reduced, leading to 75% and 50% resistance, respectively. When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2's activity is severely impaired, resulting in 10% resistance. Since a g2 knockout entirely abolishes resistance (0%), it implies that G2 is essential for resistance, and the function of G1 and G3 is to regulate G2. This makes G2 the downstream gene, acting as the critical transcription factor required for resistance, with G1 and G3 modulating its activity.
