To determine the energy difference required to clearly resolve two quantum states with lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty (or linewidth) for each state is given by \(\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}\), where \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck's constant and \(\tau\) is the lifetime of the state.

1. **Calculate the energy uncertainties (linewidths) for each state:**
   - For the state with \(\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Converting to electron volts:
     \[
     \Gamma_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 0.658 \, \mu\text{eV}
     \]

   - For the state with \(\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Converting to electron volts:
     \[
     \Gamma_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}} \approx 0.0658 \, \mu\text{eV}
     \]

2. **Sum the linewidths to determine the resolution requirement:**
   - The total linewidth (sum of the full width at half maximum, FWHM) is:
     \[
     \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 = 0.658 \, \mu\text{eV} + 0.0658 \, \mu\text{eV} \approx 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}
     \]

3. **Determine the energy difference needed for resolution:**
   - To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their linewidths. Converting \(0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}\) to eV:
     \[
     0.724 \, \mu\text{eV} = 0.724 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV}
     \]
   - Therefore, the energy difference should be at least on the order of \(10^{-6} \, \text{eV}\).

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy difference between two quantum states such that they can be clearly distinguished. The lifetimes of these states are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The question is asking which energy difference would allow us to resolve the two energy levels clearly. Let me recall some concepts here.

I remember something about the uncertainty principle relating energy and time. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, here they mention the lifetimes of the states, which I think corresponds to Δt. So each energy level has an uncertainty in energy due to their finite lifetimes. If the energy levels are too close together compared to their uncertainties, their spectral lines will overlap, making them unresolvable. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe larger than each of the uncertainties? Hmm.

Let me make this precise. The natural line width of a spectral line is given by the uncertainty principle. For a state with lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). So for the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2*1e-9), and for the second state with τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8). 

But when we have two energy levels contributing to a transition, the total line width would be the sum of the individual uncertainties? If the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the combined line widths, then perhaps they can be resolved. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the FWHM (full width at half maximum) of each peak. 

Wait, I need to clarify whether the problem is about resolving two spectral lines from transitions that each involve one of the states, or if it's about resolving the energy levels themselves when they are close. The question says "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2... clearly distinguish these two energy levels." So it's about directly resolving E1 and E2, not transitions. Then their line widths would be due to their lifetimes. So each energy level is broadened due to their finite lifetimes.

In spectroscopy, the criterion for resolving two peaks is often given by the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two peaks are resolvable if their separation is greater than the half-width of the peaks. But the exact criterion might depend on the context. Alternatively, sometimes people use the condition that the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of the line widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2 or something like that.

First, let's compute the line widths. For each state, the energy uncertainty is ΔE = ħ / (2τ). Let me calculate this.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So for τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 would be (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J. Similarly, τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ 5.27e-27 J. To convert energy from joules to electron volts, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. Let me convert these.

ΔE1 ≈ 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 0.329 μeV.

ΔE2 ≈ 5.27e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-8 eV ≈ 0.0329 μeV.

So the uncertainties in energies due to their lifetimes are approximately 0.33 μeV and 0.033 μeV. 

Now, the question is about the energy difference needed to resolve the two levels. If the energy levels are E1 and E2, then their separation ΔE_total = |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, this separation has to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or larger than the larger of the two uncertainties?

Wait, in spectroscopy, the resolution condition is often that the peaks should be separated by more than their linewidth. When two peaks have different linewidths, the usual Rayleigh criterion would require that the separation is greater than the sum of their half-widths. Let me check.

Yes, according to the Rayleigh criterion for resolution, two peaks are considered resolvable if the separation between the peaks is greater than the sum of their half-widths. If they have different widths, then the sum of their individual widths (or in some versions, the average?), then. So in terms of the full width at half maximum (FWHM), each of the energy levels has a FWHM of ΔE1 and ΔE2. So the FWHM is approximately 2ΔE for each state? Wait, wait. Wait, in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we usually write ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). Then, FWHM is often 2ΔE, so in that case, the FWHM would be ħ / Δt. Let me confirm.

Yes, the relation between the lifetime broadening (FWHM) is given by Γ = ħ / τ. So Γ is the full width at half maximum, and this comes from the Fourier transform of the exponentially decaying probability amplitude, which has a Lorentzian lineshape with FWHM Γ = ħ / τ.

Wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. However, the actual line width (FWHM) is Γ = ħ / τ. Let's check:

Since Δt is the lifetime τ, so Γ ≈ ħ / τ. Let's see with actual numbers. For τ = 1e-9 s:

Γ = ħ / τ = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. Converting to eV:

1.0545718e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV ≈ 0.658 μeV.

Wait, but earlier, ΔE from the uncertainty principle was 0.329 μeV. So this is doubled. So it seems like the FWHM is actually 2ΔE, as ΔE ≈ Γ/2.

So perhaps some confusion here. The uncertainty principle often gives ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, but Γ, the FWHM, is 2ΔE, so Γ = (2ΔE) = ħ/(Δt).

Then, with τ as the lifetime, Δt ~ τ, so Γ = ħ / τ.

Therefore, the correct FWHM for the energy levels a Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2.

Therefore, going back, calculating Γ1 and Γ2:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J ≈ 6.582e-7 eV ≈ 0.658 μeV.

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J ≈ 6.582e-8 eV ≈ 0.0658 μeV.

So each energy level has a width (FWHM) of approximately 0.658 μeV and 0.0658 μeV.

Now, to resolve two peaks, according to the Rayleigh criterion, the separation between the peaks should be at least equal to the FWHM of the broader peak. Wait, I need to check that. If the widths are different, what is the resolution criterion?

Actually, when two peaks have different widths, the standard Rayleigh criterion is adapted. For two peaks with different FWHM, Γ1 and Γ2, the resolution condition is that the separation ΔE should be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. Maybe? Or perhaps the sum of FWHMs divided by 2, perhaps.

Alternatively, another way: the combined line profile when two Lorentzians are present. The peaks will be resolvable if their separation is larger than their average FWHM. Alternatively, if the separation is greater than the sum of their FWHMs, but since the line wings of Lorentzians are broad, even a small overlap might make resolution difficult.

But in most cases, the criterion for resolution is that the peaks are separated by more than the full width of the broader peak. Or in some cases, take the mean of the two. I need to be precise here. In the classic Rayleigh criterion for diffraction-limited resolution (which is for Gaussian-like profiles, actually Airy disks), the separation is equal to the half-width. But for Lorentzian lineshapes (which result from lifetime broadening), the wings are much broader and decay more slowly. Therefore, distinguishing two Lorentzian peaks might require more separation.

But I might have to check a standard reference. However, since in exams, perhaps they use a simplified approach where you sum the uncertainties? Or use the maximum of the two uncertainties. Alternatively, since ΔE1 and ΔE2 from the uncertainty principle (ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ)) are the standard deviations, and normally, FWHM of a Lorentzian is 2Γ (but standard deviation for Lorentzian is undefined because it has heavy tails). Hmm, maybe overcomplicating.

Alternatively, using τ1 and τ2 to get the natural line widths Γ1 and Γ2 (FWHM) as ħ/τ. Then if you model each energy level as a Lorentzian with those widths. Then the criterion for resolving the two peaks (assuming they are of similar intensity) would require that the difference in energy between the two levels is greater than the sum of their FWHM. But Lorentzians are tricky because even when peaks are separated by twice the FWHM, the overlap might still be significant. But I think the standard rule of thumb is that the separation should be greater than the sum of the half-widths. However, since the problem is from an exam, probably the intended answer would assume that the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties calculated from ΔE = ħ/(2 τ). So each uncertainty ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1), ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2), sum them up, and then the energy difference should be bigger than that.

Wait, let's do the math. 

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.0545718e-34)/(2 * 1e-9 ) ≈ 5.27e-26 J ≈ 0.329 μeV.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2) ≈ 5.27e-27 J ≈ 0.0329 μeV.

Total sum: 0.329 + 0.0329 ≈ 0.3619 μeV.

Alternatively, if considering FWHM, then Γ1 and Γ2 are twice that, so Γ1 = 0.658 μeV, Γ2 = 0.0658 μeV. Sum would be ≈ 0.7238 μeV.

So depending on whether you use ΔE or Γ (FWHM). 

But if the question is about "clearly resolved", then using the sum of the FWHM (Γ1 + Γ2) seems more appropriate. Then ΔE needs to be greater than Γ1 + Γ2 ≈0.658 +0.0658≈0.724 μeV. So at least ~0.7 μeV.

Looking at the possible options, if the answer choices are in the range of μeV, then likely the correct answer is around 1 μeV. However, if options are higher, like a few μeV, then that. Since the given lifetimes are nanosecond and 10 nanoseconds. Let me check approx numbers.

Wait, Γ1 ≈ 0.658 μeV and Γ2≈0.0658 μeV sum to ~0.723 μeV. So if the energy difference is much larger than this sum, say an order of magnitude larger, maybe 7 μeV (i.e., 10 times), but check answer options. Wait, the original question states "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" Then the options, though not provided, but per instruction, but actually in the original thought process, the user says the options are to be listed, but here the user is instructing to an assistant – but in the problem description, the user says "Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?" – and the options are missing here. However, sometimes in Chinese online questions, numbers are presented but get lost when copied. However, in this problem, given it's the user asking the model, maybe the options are presented but in Chinese. Wait, no, the original user message is in English. Hmm. Well, since the options are missing, maybe this is the reason they are asking - the user copied the problem, but the options didn't make it. But in the original intention, since the problem says "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?".

Assuming that the intended answer is about energy difference greater than or equal to the sum of the energy uncertainties. Since we get about 0.7 μeV. But if the answer needs to be in a different unit, for example, 10^-4 eV is 100 μeV, which is way higher. Alternatively, since by dimensional analysis, energy-time uncertainty, with the given times, perhaps to a first approximation, ℏ divided by the shortest lifetime, so 10^-9 seconds, giving about 0.659 μeV. So the minimal energy difference would be several times that, but if the choices don't have that, maybe near 1e-4 eV (i.e., 100 μeV), but that's larger. Wait, 1e-4 eV is 100 μeV. But the sum of the linewidths at approximately 0.7 μeV, so in order to resolve the lines, the separation should be several times that. If the options provided are for example (suppose A: 1e-4 eV, B:1e-6 eV, C:1e-5 eV, D:1e-7 eV).

In that case, 0.7 μeV is 7e-7 eV. So 1e-6 eV (option B) is 1 μeV, which is larger than 0.7 μeV. Therefore, it would satisfy. If that is in the options, then that's the answer. Similarly, 1e-7 eV is 0.1 μeV, which is smaller, so probably not.

But since the problem did not provide options, but requires us to state the correct energy difference. Likely, answer is something like 10^-6 eV = 1 μeV. Hence, the answer is of the order of magnitude of the sum of the energy uncertainties. So my conclusion is that the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the individual energy widths. Since Γ1 + Γ2 ≈0.724 μeV ≈7e-7 eV. So an energy difference is at least this. Therefore, an energy difference on the order of 10^-6 eV (1 μeV) can be considered. However, depending on options, if we only have 1e-6, 1e-7, 1e-5, etc., so choose 1e-6 eV. 

Alternatively, wait, perhaps the question is expecting use of the lifetime broadening equation and energy-time uncertainty. The energies must be separated by more than their linewidths. For each energy level, the width is ħ divided by their lifetimes. The combined broadening would then be the sum of contributions from each state?

Wait, actually, when considering a transition between two energy levels, the uncertainty in the transition energy is the sum of the uncertainties of the two levels. So ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ1) + ħ/(2 τ2). Hence, to resolve the transition, the energy difference should be greater than this ΔE_total.

But in the current problem, does it relate to transitions or the energy levels themselves?

Wait, the question is about resolving two energy levels. So each energy level has its own uncertainty. If the two energy levels are not involved in a transition, but they are being measured directly. Then, their energy uncertainties due to finite lifetimes are ΔE1 and ΔE2. If their separation is large compared to these uncertainties, you can resolve them.

Therefore, to clearly resolve, energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in their energy. Which one? Let me think. For each energy level, the uncertainty is ΔE. For two energies, the jitter in each is ΔE1 and ΔE2, so the total detectable energy difference needs to be larger than the combined uncertainty. So total ΔE = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ) if they are independent uncertainties, or sum or whatever. 

But in reality, if each energy level's energy is uncertain by ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the uncertainty in the difference E2 - E1 would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), due to error propagation. Or in this case, since the uncertainties are from two different states, maybe the total uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties.

Assuming they're independent, then uncertainties add in quadrature. Therefore, the combined uncertainty would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). For our numbers:

ΔE1 ≈0.329 μeV, ΔE2≈0.0329 μeV. So the squared terms are (0.329)^2 ≈0.108, (0.0329)^2 ≈0.00108. Sum ≈0.109. Sqrt ≈0.33 μeV. So the uncertainty in the difference would be ~0.33 μeV. Then, the energy difference needs to be greater than this. So if the true energy difference is greater than, say, 3 sigma (~1 μeV), to be resolvable.

But since in quantum mechanics it's probabilistic. However, general rule for resolution is again the Rayleigh criterion. However, standard resolution conditions often use the FWHM. 

But given that in exam questions, often the approach is to derive the minimal energy difference from the total energy-time uncertainty. So delta E_total = ħ/(2 t1) + ħ/(2 t2). Then the energy difference should be larger than delta E_total.

Let me see. If t1 = 1e-9, t2 =1e-8, then:

delta E_total = ħ/(2 t1) + ħ/(2 t2) = (ħ/2)(1/t1 + 1/t2). If we plug in:

(1.05e-34 / 2) * (1e9 + 1e8) = (1.05e-34 / 2)(1.1e9) ≈ (1.05e-34 * 5.5e8) ≈ 5.775e-26 J. Which is 5.775e-26 /1.6e-19 ≈3.61e-7 eV≈ 0.361 μeV. So this is the sum off the two uncertainties. So to resolve them, the energy difference must be larger than 0.36 μeV. Hence, any energy difference above approximately 0.36 μeV is possible. However, the problem says "options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." If the options are say, 1e-6 eV (1 μeV), which is ~3 times larger, that allows a clear resolution. 0.1 μeV is smaller than 0.36 μeV so not enough. 1e-7 eV is 0.1 μeV, still insufficient. 1e-5 eV is 10 μeV, way more. So reasonable answer is 1 μeV. But since in our previous calculation, we considered Γ1 + Γ2 ~0.72 μeV as well.

But which is the correct approach? The physicist way here. The problem is likely looking for combining the uncertainties additively. So total ΔE = ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈0.36 μeV, so energy difference must be larger. Hence, 1 μeV or higher would be safe. Therefore, answer is 1e-6 eV which is 1 μeV.

Alternatively, different textbooks might present differently. Another approach is the width of the transition - the linewidth of a transition from E2 to E1 is given by Γ = Γ1 + Γ2, total decay rate. Because if both levels are decaying, the transition linewidth is the sum of the decay rates. For example, natural linewidth of a transition is the sum of the reciprocal lifetimes of the upper and lower states. Wait, actually, if the upper state has lifetime τ_upper and the lower state a longer lifetime τ_lower. The transition linewidth would be Γ_upper + Γ_lower? Or just Γ_upper?

Wait, no: in a transition from state 2 to state 1, the coherence time is determined by the dephasing time, which for natural broadening, comes from the lifetimes of both states. Thus, the linewidth (FWHM) Γ = Γ2 + Γ1, because the decay rates (probabilities per unit time) add when considering the overall dephasing. So maybe.

But our problem isn't transitions but the states themselves. If the two states are not involved in a transition, but independent states (perhaps they are different states that are being measured), but overlapping in energy. Then their individual broadenings would cause them to be indistinct if the energy difference is smaller than the sum of their widths. Alternatively, some combination. 

But maybe since the problem mentions "energy levels", they might be levels in the same system. If they are energy levels in the same system, then in order to observe them as separate peaks, their energy widths have to be smaller than their spacing. Hence, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, this would require that the energy difference is greater than the uncertainties. Since the energy uncertainty for each level is given by ΔE ~ ħ/Δτ. If you have two levels, the sum of their uncertainties should be less than their energy separation.

Alternatively, in order to resolve two peaks in the spectrum (assuming each state can be populated and their energy measured somehow), the peaks' widths must be less than the separation. So if each peak has a width ΔE1 and ΔE2, their separation must be larger than the sum of their widths (divided by 2?), depending on the criterion.

But, realistically, every measurement has finite precision. However, in this case, the main source of uncertainty is due to the lifetimes of the states leading to natural broadening. Thus, the energy uncertainty from each would set the linewidths. When trying to resolve two energy levels with natural linewidths Γ1 and Γ2 (FWHM), then to have them resolved, according to standard spectroscopy criteria, their separation should be larger than the FWHM.

But which Γ? The maximum of the two or their sum? If one level has a much narrower width, for example. If separation is > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2, resembles the idea of Rayleigh; or perhaps some modified factor. For two peaks of unequal widths, different criteria might apply. But without a specific criterion given in the question, assuming that the energy separation must be greater than the sum of the FWHM, similar to combining uncertainties.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the energy uncertainties from each state. Since each state has ΔE = ħ/(2τ), the total uncertainty when measuring their difference would be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²). But in terms of resolution, if you measure one as E1 +/- ΔE1 and the other as E2 +/- ΔE2, then the total uncertainty in their difference is the sum in quadrature. If the actual difference |E2 - E1| is greater than this combined uncertainty, then they can be separated.

Therefore, let's calculate that. ΔE1 ≈0.329 μeV, ΔE2≈0.0329 μeV. Their squares: (0.329)^2 = ~0.108, (0.0329)^2 ≈0.00108. Total: 0.109, sqrt ≈0.33 μeV.

Therefore, to resolve, |E2 - E1| > 0.33 μeV. So energy differences larger than 0.33 μeV can be resolved. But again, depending on strictness of the criterion. But likely the answer is based on summing their uncertainties (assuming linear sum), not quadrature.

Wait, but if, for example, the question expects the energy difference to be much greater than the natural linewidths. But again, since standard resolution criteria require the separation to be greater than the linewidth. For the worst case ( broader linewidth is ΔE1 ~0.329 μeV for the 1e-9 sec lifetime), if ΔE is greater than this, it would be resolved.

But because both energy levels have finite widths, their peaks would each have a width, so combined overlap would need the separation to be more than the sum of the peaks' widths. Wait, if each peak is 0.33 μeV and 0.03 μeV wide, the overlap would be significant only if the separation is less than the sum. Therefore, to be resolved, ΔE_total > sum of their widths (which are not the FWHM but the uncertainties from ΔE),so 0.33+0.03=0.36 μeV. Hence, if the actual energy difference is, say, 1 μeV, which is greater than 0.36 μeV, then they can be resolved. Alternatively, if the FWHM totalling Γ1 + Γ2 ~0.72 μeV, then ΔE >0.72 μeV.

Since actual lifetime broadening leads to FWHM of Γ = ħ / τ, so if we take separation > Γ1 + Γ2 ≈0.72 μeV, then any ΔE > ~0.72 μeV is good. Hence, an energy difference of 1 μeV would suffice.

But, given that Planck's constant is contributing here, if I compute this in actual values:

Compute Γ1 + Γ2：

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J

Sum Γ1 + Γ2 = 1.0545718e-25 + 1.0545718e-26 = 1.16e-25 J

Convert this to eV:

1.16e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 7.24e-7 eV = 0.724 μeV

Therefore, the sum of the FWHM linewidths is ~0.724 μeV, so the energy difference should be larger than this for the peaks to be clearly resolvable.

Therefore, the answer likely should be on the order of 1 μeV (1e-6 eV), which is larger than 0.724 μeV.

But let me check 1 μeV is 1e-6 eV. Yes. So if the options include something like 1 μeV or 10^-6 eV, that is the answer.

Alternatively, note that another way. Using the formula for energy uncertainty from lifetimes, which give ΔE ≈ ħ/τ. For a transition between two states, the total linewidth is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ/τ1 + ħ/τ2. So similar to natural linewidths.

But here, the problem is not about a transition, but about two separate energy levels. Hence, Γ1 and Γ2 are the linewidths of each energy level. But if you have two close energy levels, excited states with different lifetimes, their energy uncertainty are Γ1 and Γ2, then to resolve them, their energy difference should exceed Γ1 and Γ2.

But which one?

If one energy level width is 0.658 μeV and the other is 0.0658 μeV, then overlapping would occur if the energy difference is smaller than, say, the width of the wider one. But that’s if only considering one. For example, if two energy levels are separated by 0.5 μeV, the narrower state might be completely inside the broader state's linewidth.

But for resolution, say, if the peaks aren't centered at the same place but have some separation. According to the Rayleigh criterion, two peaks with FWHM Γ are resolved when their separation is at least Γ. However, in our case, the peaks have different Γ. How to handle that?

Unfortunately, the Rayleigh criterion is mainly defined for equal-intensity peaks with the same FWHM. For unequal FWHM the situation complicates. One approach is that the peaks can be resolved if the valley between them is at least 50% of the peak intensity.

But rather than being too detailed, since this is a textbook problem, it's expecting the application of Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2) = ħ*(1e9 + 1e8) ≈ ħ*1.1e9.

Wait, no. To re-express it, Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ/τ1 + ħ/τ2 = ħ(1/τ1 +1/τ2). For τ1 =1e-9 and τ2=1e-8:

1/τ1 +1/τ2 =1e9 + 1e8 =1.1e9 /sec

Hence, Γ1 + Γ2=1.05e-34 *1.1e9 ≈1.16e-25 J =7.24e-7 eV=0.724 μeV.

Therefore, the minimal energy difference is approximately 0.724 μeV, so any energy above this would be resolvable. If the options are 0.5 μeV (not enough), 1 μeV (sufficient), according to given answer options if available. So the answer is likely around 1 microelectronvolt, which is 1e-6 eV.

But converting 0.724 μeV is 7.24e-7 eV. Therefore, to be safely resolved, go for 1e-6 eV (1 μeV). So the answer would be 10^-6 eV.

But another point: In reality, exact resolvability might depend on experimental resolution. But here we are to find the energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved considering their natural linewidths. So 1e-6 eV is plausible.

Another way, perhaps the problem combines the two lifetimes by taking the minimum lifetime? Since the shorter lifetime gives a larger energy uncertainty? If they just take ΔE= ħ/(min(τ1, τ2)) = ħ/1e-9 ~1e-25 J ~0.65 μeV, so similar to our Γ1. So energy difference should be greater than ~0.65 μeV. Hence, 1 μeV is appropriate.

In conclusion, the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the individual linewidths (Γ1 + Γ2 ≈0.72 μeV ≈7.24e-7 eV), so the minimal energy difference would be approximately 0.72 μeV. The answer is likely that the energy difference should be at least greater than this. If the options include 1e-6 eV (1 μeV), that's the one. Since no options were provided, but following the user need, boxed Answer would be \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}.

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least approximately \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}} to clearly resolve the two levels.

Okay, so I need to figure out the energy difference between two quantum states such that they can be clearly distinguished. The lifetimes of these states are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The question is asking which energy difference would allow us to resolve the two energy levels clearly. Let me recall some concepts here.

I remember something about the uncertainty principle relating energy and time. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are related by ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, here they mention the lifetimes of the states, which I think corresponds to Δt. So each energy level has an uncertainty in energy due to their finite lifetimes. If the energy levels are too close together compared to their uncertainties, their spectral lines will overlap, making them unresolvable. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe larger than each of the uncertainties? Hmm.

Let me make this precise. The natural line width of a spectral line is given by the uncertainty principle. For a state with lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). So for the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2*1e-9), and for the second state with τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8). 

But when we have two energy levels contributing to a transition, the total line width would be the sum of the individual uncertainties? If the energy difference between E1 and E2 is larger than the combined line widths, then perhaps they can be resolved. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the FWHM (full width at half maximum) of each peak. 

Wait, I need to clarify whether the problem is about resolving two spectral lines from transitions that each involve one of the states, or if it's about resolving the energy levels themselves when they are close. The question says "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2... clearly distinguish these two energy levels." So it's about directly resolving E1 and E2, not transitions. Then their line widths would be due to their lifetimes. So each energy level is broadened due to their finite lifetimes.

In spectroscopy, the criterion for resolving two peaks is often given by the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two peaks are resolvable if their separation is greater than the half-width of the peaks. But the exact criterion might depend on the context. Alternatively, sometimes people use the condition that the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of the line widths (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2 or something like that.

First, let's compute the line widths. For each state, the energy uncertainty is ΔE = ħ / (2τ). Let me calculate this.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So for τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 would be (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J. Similarly, τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ 5.27e-27 J. To convert energy from joules to electron volts, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. Let me convert these.

ΔE1 ≈ 5.27e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 0.329 μeV.

ΔE2 ≈ 5.27e-27 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-8 eV ≈ 0.0329 μeV.

So the uncertainties in energies due to their lifetimes are approximately 0.33 μeV and 0.033 μeV. 

Now, the question is about the energy difference needed to resolve the two levels. If the energy levels are E1 and E2, then their separation ΔE_total = |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, this separation has to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or larger than the larger of the two uncertainties?

Wait, in spectroscopy, the resolution condition is often that the peaks should be separated by more than their linewidth. When two peaks have different linewidths, the usual Rayleigh criterion would require that the separation is greater than the sum of their half-widths. Let me check.

Yes, according to the Rayleigh criterion for resolution, two peaks are considered resolvable if the separation between the peaks is greater than the sum of their half-widths. If they have different widths, then the sum of their individual widths (or in some versions, the average?), then. So in terms of the full width at half maximum (FWHM), each of the energy levels has a FWHM of ΔE1 and ΔE2. So the FWHM is approximately 2ΔE for each state? Wait, wait. Wait, in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we usually write ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). Then, FWHM is often 2ΔE, so in that case, the FWHM would be ħ / Δt. Let me confirm.

Yes, the relation between the lifetime broadening (FWHM) is given by Γ = ħ / τ. So Γ is the full width at half maximum, and this comes from the Fourier transform of the exponentially decaying probability amplitude, which has a Lorentzian lineshape with FWHM Γ = ħ / τ.

Wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation states that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. However, the actual line width (FWHM) is Γ = ħ / τ. Let's check:

Since Δt is the lifetime τ, so Γ ≈ ħ / τ. Let's see with actual numbers. For τ = 1e-9 s:

Γ = ħ / τ = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. Converting to eV:

1.0545718e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV ≈ 0.658 μeV.

Wait, but earlier, ΔE from the uncertainty principle was 0.329 μeV. So this is doubled. So it seems like the FWHM is actually 2ΔE, as ΔE ≈ Γ/2.

So perhaps some confusion here. The uncertainty principle often gives ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, but Γ, the FWHM, is 2ΔE, so Γ = (2ΔE) = ħ/(Δt).

Then, with τ as the lifetime, Δt ~ τ, so Γ = ħ / τ.

Therefore, the correct FWHM for the energy levels a Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2.

Therefore, going back, calculating Γ1 and Γ2:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J ≈ 6.582e-7 eV ≈ 0.658 μeV.

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J ≈ 6.582e-8 eV ≈ 0.0658 μeV.

So each energy level has a width (FWHM) of approximately 0.658 μeV and 0.0658 μeV.

Now, to resolve two peaks, according to the Rayleigh criterion, the separation between the peaks should be at least equal to the FWHM of the broader peak. Wait, I need to check that. If the widths are different, what is the resolution criterion?

Actually, when two peaks have different widths, the standard Rayleigh criterion is adapted. For two peaks with different FWHM, Γ1 and Γ2, the resolution condition is that the separation ΔE should be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. Maybe? Or perhaps the sum of FWHMs divided by 2, perhaps.

Alternatively, another way: the combined line profile when two Lorentzians are present. The peaks will be resolvable if their separation is larger than their avera

I need to determine the energy difference required for clearly distinguishing two quantum states with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. This involves understanding how the uncertainty principle applies to this situation.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates energy uncertainty (ΔE) and time uncertainty (Δt) by ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. The lifetimes of these states correspond to Δt, and each energy level has an associated uncertainty due to its finite lifetime. For effective resolution, the energy difference between levels must exceed their uncertainties.

For a state with lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty is typically expressed as ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). Using this formula, I can calculate:
- For the first state (τ1 = 10^-9 s): ΔE1 = ħ/(2*10^-9)
- For the second state (τ2 = 10^-8 s): ΔE2 = ħ/(2*10^-8)

The question appears to be asking about resolving the energy levels themselves, not transitions between them. Each level is broadened due to its finite lifetime.

In spectroscopy, the Rayleigh criterion typically determines when two peaks are resolvable - generally when their separation exceeds the half-width of the peaks. However, the exact criterion may vary with context.

Let me calculate the actual line widths:
Using ħ ≈ 1.0545718×10^-34 J·s:
- For τ1 = 10^-9 s: ΔE1 ≈ 5.27×10^-26 J ≈ 0.329 μeV
- For τ2 = 10^-8 s: ΔE2 ≈ 5.27×10^-27 J ≈ 0.0329 μeV

However, when discussing spectral lines, we often use the full width at half maximum (FWHM), which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ/τ. This comes from the Fourier transform of the decaying probability amplitude, yielding a Lorentzian lineshape.

Recalculating using this relationship:
- Γ1 = ħ/τ1 ≈ 1.0545718×10^-25 J ≈ 0.658 μeV
- Γ2 = ħ/τ2 ≈ 1.0545718×10^-26 J ≈ 0.0658 μeV

So the energy levels have widths (FWHM) of approximately 0.658 μeV and 0.0658 μeV respectively.

For resolving two peaks with different widths, the Rayleigh criterion suggests that their separation should be greater than the FWHM of the broader peak, or possibly than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. Alternatively, the resolution might depend on the combined line profile when two Lorentzians are present.

Alright, I need to determine the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be distinguished distinctly. These states have lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two energy levels. I need to revisit some concepts to understand this.

I recall something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates energy and time, stating that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) are connected by ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. The lifetimes given in the problem seem to correspond to Δt, indicating that each energy level has an energy uncertainty due to its finite lifetime. If the energy levels are closer than these uncertainties, their spectral lines may overlap, making them indistinguishable. To distinguish them clearly, the energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, or perhaps greater than either of these uncertainties.

Let's compute the line widths precisely. A state's natural line width is determined by the uncertainty principle. For a state with lifetime τ, the energy uncertainty is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). For the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2*1e-9), and for the second state with τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 = ħ/(2*1e-8).

When there are two energy levels, the total line width is the sum of their individual uncertainties. If the energy difference between E1 and E2 exceeds these combined line widths, they can potentially be resolved. Alternatively, the energy difference may be required to be greater than each peak's FWHM.

Reconsidering, the question specifies energy levels E1 and E2, not transitions, so it concerns resolving the energy levels directly. In spectroscopy, resolving two peaks typically follows the Rayleigh criterion, which asserts that two peaks are resolvable if their separation exceeds their half-widths. The precise criterion might vary, but one common condition is that the energy difference ΔE should be greater than half the sum of the line widths, (ΔE1 + ΔE2)/2.

To find the line widths, for each state, the energy uncertainty is ΔE = ħ / (2τ). Using Planck’s constant ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s: 

For τ1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J, converting to eV yields: ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV ≈ 0.329 μeV.

For τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J, converting to eV yields: ΔE2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV ≈ 0.0329 μeV.

The energy uncertainties due to their lifetimes are approximately 0.33 μeV and 0.033 μeV.

To resolve the levels, if the energy separation is ΔE_total = |E2 - E1|, it should exceed these uncertainties? According to spectroscopy norms, a common resolution condition is that the separation must exceed their combined linewidth.

Using the Heisenberg principle ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, FWHM usually equals 2ΔE, therefore the FWHM is ħ / τ. Thus, for each state, the FWHM is:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J ≈ 6.582e-7 eV ≈ 0.658 μeV.

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J ≈ 6.582e-8 eV ≈ 0.0658 μeV.

Each energy level has widths of approximately 0.658 μeV and 0.0658 μeV.

Resolving peaks per Rayleigh criterion requires separation greater than the broader peak's FWHM. However, with differing widths, the modified criterion is that ΔE should be greater than the sum of half their FWHMs. Thus, the separation should be more than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2 or possibly the full sum depending on approach, ensuring clarity in context.

For Gaussian profiles, the Rayleigh criterion is that the separation is at least the FWHM. For Lorentzian profiles, the situation is different, as Lorentzians have broader tails. But the problem probably expects us to use the basic Rayleigh criterion regardless of the lineshape.\n\nAssuming we use the Rayleigh criterion in the standard way, requiring the separation to be greater than the FWHM. If one peak is much broader than the other, then we need the separation to be greater than the FWHM of the broader peak.\n\nBut in this case, Γ1 = 0.658 μeV and Γ2 = 0.0658 μeV, so Γ1 is ten times larger than Γ2. So the broader peak has Γ1 = ~0.66 μeV, and the narrower one has about 0.066 μeV. So to resolve them, we need the energy separation ΔE to be larger than Γ1? Because the broad peak\'s width would otherwise overlap the narrow peak.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relevant linewidth is from both states contributing. For example, if you have a transition between two states each with their own lifetimes, but here the problem is about the energies themselves. Wait, no, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. So each energy level is broadened due to their finite lifetimes, so their widths are Γ1 and Γ2. If you want to distinguish the two energy levels, the separation between E1 and E2 must be larger than the combined widths. For example, the sum of Γ1 and Γ2, or half of it?\n\nAlternatively, if using the FWHM, to resolve two Lorentzian peaks separated by ΔE, the criterion is that ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. Is this the formula? Let me check.\n\nAccording to some references, the criterion for resolving two Lorentzian peaks of equal width Γ is ΔE > Γ. But when they have unequal widths, perhaps the criterion is more complicated. Alternatively, some sources suggest that for Gaussians, the standard Rayleigh criterion is ΔE > FWHM, and for Lorentzians, which have broader tails, ΔE needs to be much larger to have a visible dip. However, for the purpose of this problem, maybe they just expect us to take ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, considering the uncertainty principle. Wait, but the question gives two different lifetimes, so combining their uncertainties.\n\nHowever, the problem is about resolving the two energies E1 and E2 based on their line widths. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties from each energy level. Each energy level\'s uncertainty is Γ1 and Γ2, which are ħ / τ1 and ħ / τ2.\n\nBut when considering transitions between two energy levels, the uncertainty in the transition energy would be the sum of the uncertainties of the two levels. Wait, if we were talking about a transition from E1 to E2, then the line width would be Γ1 + Γ2. However, in this problem, perhaps the energy levels themselves are being considered. If you are trying to measure the energy levels directly, for example in a situation where you can probe each energy level, but they have a finite width. However, if the two energy levels are close, their widths may cause them to overlap.\n\nSo to resolve E1 and E2 as separate, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual linewidths? Or just larger than one of them?\n\nSuppose the two energies are E1 ± Γ1/2 and E2 ± Γ2/2. For their ranges not to overlap, |E1 - E2| > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. That way, the uncertainty ranges do not overlap. So the separation must be more than half the sum of the two widths?\n\nWait, let\'s think graphically. Suppose E1 has an uncertainty range from E1 - Γ1/2 to E1 + Γ1/2, and E2 from E2 - Γ2/2 to E2 + Γ2/2. For these intervals not to overlap, the lower bound of E2 must be greater than the upper bound of E1:\n\nE2 - Γ2/2 > E1 + Γ1/2 => E2 - E1 > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2.\n\nAlternatively, the separation ΔE must be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2.\n\nAlternatively, some sources might use that the separation must be greater than the sum of the standard deviations (which for Lorentzian is not defined, because Lorentzian distributions have undefined variance). However, using FWHM, yes.\n\nSo if the answer is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the individual line widths divided by 2, then ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. Let\'s compute Γ1 + Γ2:\n\nΓ1 ≈ 0.658 μeV\n\nΓ2 ≈ 0.0658 μeV\n\nSum is 0.658 + 0.0658 ≈ 0.7238 μeV\n\nDivided by 2 gives 0.3619 μeV. So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 0.36 μeV.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the combined linewidth for a transition between the two states would be Γ1 + Γ2, but since here we are considering the two energy levels themselves, each with their own width. So if the peaks are separated by more than their widths, e.g., in the case where you can measure both, then the required separation is about the sum of the widths.\n\nBut in any case, depending on the criterion, the needed energy difference will be somewhere around 0.658 μeV or the sum. But given the problem\'s options, likely it\'s expecting us to compute the energy uncertainty based on each state\'s lifetime and then sum them? Wait, but maybe not.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the energy uncertainty due to the finite lifetimes, and the energy difference should be larger than that. Let me re-read the question.\n\n"Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?"\n\nWait, so the question is not specifying anything else. Maybe the important thing is the sum of the uncertainties. Each state\'s energy uncertainty is given by Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Then, total uncertainty in their energies would be Γ1 + Γ2. Then, in order to resolve the energy levels, their energy difference should be greater than this sum.\n\nWait, but if their energies have uncertainties Γ1 and Γ2, to resolve them, the separation should be greater than the sum? Or the quadratic sum? Probably, in the worst case, just the sum. So ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.\n\nBut Γ1 is approximately 6.582e-7 eV and Γ2 is 6.582e-8 eV. Adding them, 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nSo, the energy difference should be larger than approximately 0.724 μeV. But since the question gives options (which we can\'t see), but if the answer is to be in the order of 10^-6 eV (μeV), then the correct option is 10^-6 eV. However, in the detailed calculation, 0.724 μeV is about 7e-7 eV. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the individual widths and uses that the energy difference should be greater than the width of the broader state, which is Γ1 ≈ 0.658 μeV, so 6.58e-7 eV. If the options have an answer close to that, that might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, suppose if they consider each energy\'s uncertainty as Γ1 and Γ2, then the energy difference should be greater than the maximum of Γ1 and Γ2. Since Γ1 > Γ2, then energy difference must be greater than Γ1 ≈ 0.658 μeV. So, if an option is in the range of 1e-6 eV (1 μeV), then it would be more than sufficient.\n\nBut the actual value would depend on which criterion is used. Let\'s check.\n\nAccording to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. The figure of merit for resolvability is whether the energy splitting is larger than the energy uncertainty. Thus, if the energy difference between the two states is greater than each of their uncertainties (or the sum in the worst case), then they can be resolved.\n\nSo possible answers are approximately 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) because this is larger than the sum 0.724 μeV. If given options, for instance, 1e-6 eV would work.\n\nAlternatively, if the options were in different orders of magnitude, like 1e-5 eV, 1e-6 eV, 1e-7 eV, etc., 1e-6 eV would be the right one.\n\nSince I don\'t have the options, but the user is probably expecting me to show the calculation.\n\nSo step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.\n\n2. Calculate Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.\n\n3. Sum the two linewidths: Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\n4. To resolve them, the energy difference must be greater than approximately this sum. Therefore, an energy difference on the order of 1 μeV (1e-6 eV) would suffice to clearly distinguish them.\n\nBut depending on the answer options, if 1e-6 eV is an option, that\'s the answer. If 1e-5 eV is also an option, then it\'s better to note that. But since I don\'t have the options, but the user likely wants me to compute the value.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is multiple-choice, but the options are not provided, the answer should be in the range of 1e-6 eV (μeV). However, precise calculation gives the sum of uncertainties as ~0.724 μeV, so 0.7 μeV or higher.\n\nBut if I need to select an order of magnitude, 1e-6 eV would be appropriate since it\'s the next order up and safely above the sum of the uncertainties. Alternatively, the problem might want the minimum energy difference so that it\'s greater than the linewidth of the broader state, which is 0.658 μeV. So maybe 1e-6 eV is safer.\n\nBut here, let me check if the resolution is based on the natural line width. The natural line width (Γ) is given by the lifetime, so the minimal energy difference should be about Γ.\n\nHowever, since there are two states with different lifetimes, if Γ1 is the larger one, then to resolve the states, you need ΔE > Γ1. So Γ1 ≈ 0.658 μeV.\n\nThus, the energy difference should be on the order of 1 μeV. Therefore, the correct answer is probably in the range of 1e-6 eV (1 μeV). So need to check 1 μeV. Hence, I think the answer is around 1 μeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy difference should be at least on the order of \\boxed{10^{-6} \\text{ eV}} to clearly resolve the two quantum states.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744973502, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3030, prompt_tokens=1861, total_tokens=4891, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with lifetimes \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty (or line width) for each state is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

For the first state with \(\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\) s:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \approx 0.329 \, \mu\text{eV}
\]

For the second state with \(\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\) s:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \approx 0.0329 \, \mu\text{eV}
\]

The full width at half maximum (FWHM) for each state, which is twice the uncertainty, is:
- \(\Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} \approx 0.658 \, \mu\text{eV}\)
- \(\Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} \approx 0.0658 \, \mu\text{eV}\)

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their line widths. However, considering the broader line width (since one state has a much shorter lifetime), the energy difference should be at least on the order of the broader line width:

\[
\Gamma_1 \approx 0.658 \, \mu\text{eV}
\]

Thus, the energy difference should be at least \(10^{-6} \, \text{eV}\) (1 μeV) to clearly distinguish the two quantum states.

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}

of their widths, but I might need to recall the exact formula.

Wait, the general criterion is that the two peaks are considered resolved if the dip between the peaks is at least 20% or so of the maximum intensity. For Gaussian profiles, the Rayleigh criterion is that the separation is at least the FWHM. For Lorentzian profiles, the situation is different, as Lorentzians have broader tails. But the problem probably expects us to use the basic Rayleigh criterion regardless of the lineshape.

Assuming we use the Rayleigh criterion in the standard way, requiring the separation to be greater than the FWHM. If one peak is much broader than the other, then we need the separation to be greater than the FWHM of the broader peak.

But in this case, Γ1 = 0.658 μeV and Γ2 = 0.0658 μeV, so Γ1 is ten times larger than Γ2. So the broader peak has Γ1 = ~0.66 μeV, and the narrower one has about 0.066 μeV. So to resolve them, we need the energy separation ΔE to be larger than Γ1? Because the broad peak's width would otherwise overlap the narrow peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the relevant linewidth is from both states contributing. For example, if you have a transition between two states each with their own lifetimes, but here the problem is about the energies themselves. Wait, no, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. So each energy level is broadened due to their finite lifetimes, so their widths are Γ1 and Γ2. If you want to distinguish the two energy levels, the separation between E1 and E2 must be larger than the combined widths. For example, the sum of Γ1 and Γ2, or half of it?

Alternatively, if using the FWHM, to resolve two Lorentzian peaks separated by ΔE, the criterion is that ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. Is this the formula? Let me check.

According to some references, the criterion for resolving two Lorentzian peaks of equal width Γ is ΔE > Γ. But when they have unequal widths, perhaps the criterion is more complicated. Alternatively, some sources suggest that for Gaussians, the standard Rayleigh criterion is ΔE > FWHM, and for Lorentzians, which have broader tails, ΔE needs to be much larger to have a visible dip. However, for the purpose of this problem, maybe they just expect us to take ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, considering the uncertainty principle. Wait, but the question gives two different lifetimes, so combining their uncertainties.

However, the problem is about resolving the two energies E1 and E2 based on their line widths. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties from each energy level. Each energy level's uncertainty is Γ1 and Γ2, which are ħ / τ1 and ħ / τ2.

But when considering transitions between two energy levels, the uncertainty in the transition energy would be the sum of the uncertainties of the two levels. Wait, if we were talking about a transition from E1 to E2, then the line width would be Γ1 + Γ2. However, in this problem, perhaps the energy levels themselves are being considered. If you are trying to measure the energy levels directly, for example in a situation where you can probe each energy level, but they have a finite width. However, if the two energy levels are close, their widths may cause them to overlap.

So to resolve E1 and E2 as separate, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual linewidths? Or just larger than one of them?

Suppose the two energies are E1 ± Γ1/2 and E2 ± Γ2/2. For their ranges not to overlap, |E1 - E2| > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. That way, the uncertainty ranges do not overlap. So the separation must be more than half the sum of the two widths?

Wait, let's think graphically. Suppose E1 has an uncertainty range from E1 - Γ1/2 to E1 + Γ1/2, and E2 from E2 - Γ2/2 to E2 + Γ2/2. For these intervals not to overlap, the lower bound of E2 must be greater than the upper bound of E1:

E2 - Γ2/2 > E1 + Γ1/2 => E2 - E1 > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2.

Alternatively, the separation ΔE must be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2.

Alternatively, some sources might use that the separation must be greater than the sum of the standard deviations (which for Lorentzian is not defined, because Lorentzian distributions have undefined variance). However, using FWHM, yes.

So if the answer is that the separation must be greater than the sum of the individual line widths divided by 2, then ΔE > (Γ1 + Γ2)/2. Let's compute Γ1 + Γ2:

Γ1 ≈ 0.658 μeV

Γ2 ≈ 0.0658 μeV

Sum is 0.658 + 0.0658 ≈ 0.7238 μeV

Divided by 2 gives 0.3619 μeV. So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 0.36 μeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the combined linewidth for a transition between the two states would be Γ1 + Γ2, but since here we are considering the two energy levels themselves, each with their own width. So if the peaks are separated by more than their widths, e.g., in the case where you can measure both, then the required separation is about the sum of the widths.

But in any case, depending on the criterion, the needed energy difference will be somewhere around 0.658 μeV or the sum. But given the problem's options, likely it's expecting us to compute the energy uncertainty based on each state's lifetime and then sum them? Wait, but maybe not.

Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the energy uncertainty due to the finite lifetimes, and the energy difference should be larger than that. Let me re-read the question.

"Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved?"

Wait, so the question is not specifying anything else. Maybe the important thing is the sum of the uncertainties. Each state's energy uncertainty is given by Γ1 = ħ / τ1 and Γ2 = ħ / τ2. Then, total uncertainty in their energies would be Γ1 + Γ2. Then, in order to resolve the energy levels, their energy difference should be greater than this sum.

Wait, but if their energies have uncertainties Γ1 and Γ2, to resolve them, the separation should be greater than the sum? Or the quadratic sum? Probably, in the worst case, just the sum. So ΔE > Γ1 + Γ2.

But Γ1 is approximately 6.582e-7 eV and Γ2 is 6.582e-8 eV. Adding them, 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.

So, the energy difference should be larger than approximately 0.724 μeV. But since the question gives options (which we can't see), but if the answer is to be in the order of 10^-6 eV (μeV), then the correct option is 10^-6 eV. However, in the detailed calculation, 0.724 μeV is about 7e-7 eV. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the individual widths and uses that the energy difference should be greater than the width of the broader state, which is Γ1 ≈ 0.658 μeV, so 6.58e-7 eV. If the options have an answer close to that, that might be acceptable.

Alternatively, suppose if they consider each energy's uncertainty as Γ1 and Γ2, then the energy difference should be greater than the maximum of Γ1 and Γ2. Since Γ1 > Γ2, then energy difference must be greater than Γ1 ≈ 0.658 μeV. So, if an option is in the range of 1e-6 eV (1 μeV), then it would be more than sufficient.

But the actual value would depend on which criterion is used. Let's check.

According to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, ΔE ≈ ħ / τ. The figure of merit for resolvability is whether the energy splitting is larger than the energy uncertainty. Thus, if the energy difference between the two states is greater than each of their uncertainties (or the sum in the worst case), then they can be resolved.

So possible answers are approximately 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) because this is larger than the sum 0.724 μeV. If given options, for instance, 1e-6 eV would work.

Alternatively, if the options were in different orders of magnitude, like 1e-5 eV, 1e-6 eV, 1e-7 eV, etc., 1e-6 eV would be the right one.

Since I don't have the options, but the user is probably expecting me to show the calculation.

So step-by-step:

1. Calculate Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

2. Calculate Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-8 s) ≈ 1.0545718e-26 J ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

3. Sum the two linewidths: Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 6.58e-7 + 6.58e-8 ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.

4. To resolve them, the energy difference must be greater than approximately this sum. Therefore, an energy difference on the order of 1 μeV (1e-6 eV) would suffice to clearly distinguish them.

But depending on the answer options, if 1e-6 eV is an option, that's the answer. If 1e-5 eV is also an option, then it's better to note that. But since I don't have the options, but the user likely wants me to compute the value.

Alternatively, since the problem is multiple-choice, but the options are not provided, the answer should be in the range of 1e-6 eV (μeV). However, precise calculation gives the sum of uncertainties as ~0.724 μeV, so 0.7 μeV or higher.

But if I need to select an order of magnitude, 1e-6 eV would be appropriate since it's the next order up and safely above the sum of the uncertainties. Alternatively, the problem might want the minimum energy difference so that it's greater than the linewidth of the broader state, which is 0.658 μeV. So maybe 1e-6 eV is safer.

But here, let me check if the resolution is based on the natural line width. The natural line width (Γ) is given by the lifetime, so the minimal energy difference should be about Γ.

However, since there are two states with different lifetimes, if Γ1 is the larger one, then to resolve the states, you need ΔE > Γ1. So Γ1 ≈ 0.658 μeV.

Thus, the energy difference should be on the order of 1 μeV. Therefore, the correct answer is probably in the range of 1e-6 eV (1 μeV). So need to check 1 μeV. Hence, I think the answer is around 1 μeV.

**Final Answer**
The energy difference should be at least on the order of \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}} to clearly resolve the two quantum states.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with lifetimes of \(10^{-9}\) seconds and \(10^{-8}\) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The energy uncertainty \((\Delta E)\) for each state is related to its lifetime \((\tau)\) by \(\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}\).

1. **Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state:**
   - For the first state (\(\tau_1 = 10^{-9}\) s):
     \[
     \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J} \approx 0.658 \, \mu\text{eV}
     \]
   - For the second state (\(\tau_2 = 10^{-8}\) s):
     \[
     \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \approx 0.0658 \, \mu\text{eV}
     \]

2. **Determine the total energy uncertainty:**
   - The total energy uncertainty (linewidth) for resolving the two states is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
     \[
     \Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 0.658 \, \mu\text{eV} + 0.0658 \, \mu\text{eV} \approx 0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}
     \]

3. **Determine the required energy difference:**
   - To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference must be greater than the total linewidth. Therefore, an energy difference of approximately \(1 \, \mu\text{eV}\) (which is greater than \(0.724 \, \mu\text{eV}\)) would be sufficient.

Thus, the energy difference that allows clear resolution of the two states is \(\boxed{1 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}}\).

Let me check:

Assume the observed line shape is a convolution of both individual line shapes. Given that each state's energy contributes to the transition linewidth, but depending on whether these are upper and lower states or individual energy levels.

Wait, the problem states "two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively." So each energy level has its own lifetime. If we are to resolve transitions between these two states (assuming they are part of a system where transitions can occur between them), then the transition linewidth would be Γ = Γ1 + Γ2. Because each state contributes to the total linewidth via their respective lifetimes.

Wait, the natural linewidth (lifetime broadening) of a transition between two states arises from the sum of the inverse lifetimes of both states. So Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2 = ħ(1/τ1 + 1/τ2)

But if E1 and E2 are the lower and upper states of a transition, the linewidth Γ of the transition would be Γ = Γ_upper + Γ_lower. Thus, if the question is about resolving the transition between these two states, their energy difference needs to be greater than the linewidth of the transition.

But the problem states "We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels." Maybe the question is not about a transition but the individual energy levels - but in practice, observing them would likely involve transitions. Alternatively, if each energy level is observed through their own linewidths, perhaps in separate experiments? Not sure. Let's clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that each energy level has an uncertainty due to their respective lifetimes. To resolve E1 and E2, the difference |E2 - E1| must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. That is:

ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2

If that holds, then the energy levels are resolvable. Alternatively, some other measure.

Alternatively, if each energy level is broadened by its own lifetime, the ability to resolve them would require their energy separation to be larger than the combined linewidths.

Assuming the broadened widths add in quadrature? Or a convolution? Actually, if each state is broadened with a Lorentzian lineshape, the convolution (if they are measured independently?) might complicate.

The intention here is likely to compute the natural linewidth (uncertainty in energy) for each state and then state that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. So first calculate delta E for each:

Taking the natural linewidth (Γ) as Γ = ħ / τ.

For τ1 =1e-9 s, Γ1=1.0545718e-34 Js / 1e-9 s=1.0545718e-25 J. Convert to eV: 1 eV =1.602e-19 J, so 1.0545718e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-7 eV ≈ 0.658 μeV.

Similarly for τ2 = 1e-8 s: Γ2=1.0545718e-34 /1e-8 =1.0545718e-26 J = ~0.0658 μeV.

So total linewidth when considering both states? If the transition between the two states would have Γ1 + Γ2 ≈ 0.724 μeV.

Alternatively, since each state contributes its linewidth to the transition, so the transition would have an uncertainty of Γ_total = Γ1 + Γ2. For the energy levels themselves, but actually resolving the states doesn't depend only on transition linewidth—if we just want to say that the energies are E1 and E2, and each has uncertainty. To resolve them, need |E2 - E1| > (ΔE1 + ΔE2), which in this case would be 0.658 + 0.0658 ≈ 0.724 μeV. So any energy difference larger than this would suffice.

But considering that the options given (as perhaps in the original question) would be something like 1 μeV, which is larger than 0.724 μeV, so that's the answer.

But let me verify. If the natural linewidth is around 0.724 μeV for the transition, then the energy difference must be larger than that. So the answer is the energy difference should be larger than approximately 0.724 μeV.

But without the options, but in the user's original problem, the options exist, so perhaps in their question the answer would be the minimal energy difference satisfying this.

Alternatively, if we use another approach. Assume that the energy uncertainty of each state is so δE ≈ ħ / τ. Then two values δE1 = ħ / τ1 and δE2= ħ / τ2. Then, to resolve the energy levels, their separation should be greater than the sum of uncertainties? Or the square root of the sum of squares? Let's see.

Another approach, the idea of frequency resolution. The linewidth in terms of frequency would be Δf = ΔE / h. Then, if the frequency difference between two lines is greater than the linewidths, they can be resolved.

Alternatively, the linewidths combined as Γ1 + Γ2. If the energy difference is greater than (Γ1 + Γ2)/2, not sure. Alternatively, stored in terms of wavelengths, maybe use convolution.

But perhaps the standard approach is that the natural linewidth of the transition is Γ = Γ1 + Γ2. Hence the energy resolution needed is at least on the order of Γ. So in this case, Γ = ~0.724 μeV, so the energy difference should be larger than that.

Therefore, the answer would be an energy difference greater than approximately 0.7 μeV. If given options, say 1 μeV, then it's the answer.

If the question is asking for selection between (probably) 1e-5 eV (10 μeV), 1e-6 eV (1 μeV), 1e-7 eV (0.1 μeV), etc. The required resolution is roughly 0.724 μeV, so to clearly resolve with margin, likely 1 μeV would be the answer.

Alternatively, different theories: if the criterion is that the energy difference is greater than the lifetime broadening of each individual state (say the broader one? The first state has larger Γ), so it's 0.658 μeV. So the answer must be larger than that.

Therefore, in order to clearly resolve, an energy difference greater than approximately 1 μeV (that would be 10^-6 eV) would work, depending on the options provided. If say 10^-6 eV (1 μeV) is one of the options, that would be appropriate.

To check, 1 μeV =1 x 10^-6 eV. Γ_total is approximately 0.724 x 10^-6 eV, so 1 μeV exceeds that. Thus, the answer should be \boxed{1 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}}

Alternatively, uncertainty in energy difference could be sqrt(ΔE1² +ΔE2²), but it depends on how they combine. Thus, perhaps we need the energy difference |E2 - E1| > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to clearly resolve.\n\nAlternatively, if the natural linewidth is treated as FWHM of a Lorentzian, and when two Lorentzians with widths Γ1 and Γ2 are considered, the required separation would be on the order of their average line widths.\n\nBut perhaps since their lifetimes are individual, let\'s compute the combined effect. For two energy levels each with linewidths Γ1 and Γ2. If you have a transition between them, that would have a line width of Γ1 + Γ2. However, here the question isn\'t about a transition but resolving the energies themselves. So if you try to measure E1 and E2, each smeared out by their own linewidth, then the uncertainty in their energies is Γ1 and Γ2. Then the energy difference between them would have a total uncertainty of sqrt(Γ1² + Γ2²), assuming the uncertainties are independent. To resolve the energy levels, the separation ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty. So ΔE > sqrt(Γ1² + Γ2²).\n\nBut let\'s compute Γ1 and Γ2:\n\nΓ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / 1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J ≈ 6.582e-7 eV\n\nΓ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J ≈ 6.582e-8 eV\n\nThus, the uncertainties on energies would be approximately 0.658 μeV and 0.0658 μeV.\n\nSo the combined uncertainty would be sqrt( (0.658 μeV)^2 + (0.0658 μeV)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.433 + 0.00433) μeV ≈ sqrt(0.4373) ≈ 0.661 μeV.\n\nSo the uncertainty in the energy difference would be around 0.66 μeV.

Well, perhaps in reality, if you have two energy levels each with a width Γ1 and Γ2, then the requirement for them to be distinguishable is that the energy difference is larger than the widths. Since the widths are approximately 0.658 μeV and 0.0658 μeV, so up to 1e-6 eV. So, the possible answer is around 1e-6 eV. But the possible options might have values like 10^-4 eV, 10^-6 eV, etc.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s check the numbers once more:\n\nConvert Γ1 and Γ2 to eV:\n\nΓ1 = ħ / τ1. Let me compute:\n\nħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s\n\nBut 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J, so ħ in eV s is 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV s.\n\nThus Γ1 in eV would be (6.582e-16 eV s) / τ1, where τ1 is 1e-9 s:\n\nΓ1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV ≈ 0.658 μeV\n\nSimilarly, Γ2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV ≈ 0.0658 μeV\n\nSo As previously found, the linewidths are approx 0.658 μeV and 0.0658 μeV. Let\'s compute the sum of these: 0.658 + 0.0658 ≈ 0.7238 μeV ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.\n\nAlternatively, considering the average width might be needed or even each individually. For safe resolution, the energy difference should be much larger than these uncertainties. But given the options, perhaps, an answer that\'s higher than about 1 μeV would work. Let me check the energy-time uncertainty relation again.\n\nEnergy-time uncertainty: ΔE ≥ ħ / (2Δt). Δt is the lifetime here, as the characteristic time. So uncertainty in each energy is minimal when you take the maximum observation time as the lifetime? If the two states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, but when we are trying to measure their energies, the measurement time is presumably limited by their lifetimes, as after that time the state decays. So the uncertainty in energy comes from ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.\n\nBut for each state, the uncertainty in Energy is roughly about ħ / τ. Thus, if E_1 has ΔE ≈ ħ / τ1 and E_2 has ΔE ≈ ħ / τ2, then the total uncertainty in ΔE between the two would be sqrt( (ħ / τ1)^2 + (ħ / τ2)^2 ). So, the energy difference should be larger that this uncertainty.\n\nSo plugging the numbers as in:\n\n∆E_min = sqrt( (ħ / τ1)^2 + (ħ / τ2)^2 )\n\nCalculating that:\n\n= ħ * sqrt(1/τ1² + 1/τ2² )\n\nSubstitute τ1 = 1e-9, τ2 =1e-8\n\n= ħ * sqrt(1e18 + 1e16 )\n\n= ħ * sqrt(10^18*(1 + 0.01)) ≈ ħ * 1e9 * sqrt(1.01) ≈ ħ * 1e9 *1.005≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1.005e9 s^-1 ≈ 1.06e-25 J ≈ to eV: (1.06e-25 / 1.6e-19) ≈ 6.625e-7 eV ≈ 0.6625 μeV, which matches prior calculation.\n\nThus, the energy difference needs to be greater than approximately 0.66 μeV. So if that\'s the resolution limit, the energy difference must be larger than 0.66 μeV. Hence, in order to clearly resolve the two, their energy difference should be something like 1 μeV (~1e-6 eV) or higher, allowing for clear distinction.\n\nLooking at possible options (which the user hasn\'t listed here). But typical exam questions for such a problem could offer choices like: 1x10^-4 eV, 1x10^-6 eV, 1x10^-7 eV, etc. The answer will then be around ~1 μeV, so likely option 1e-6 eV.\n\nHowever, since the problem says "clearly resolved", then perhaps more stringent. Some sources may say peaks can be distinguished when their separation > FWHM maximum, so if ΔE > Γ_max. Here Γ_max is Γ1 = 0.658 μeV ≈ ~0.7 μeV, so to clearly resolve, we need ΔE at least greater than 0.7 μeV.\n\nAssuming the options had comparable values, such as a) 1e-4 eV, b) 1e-5 eV, c) 1e-6 eV, d)1e-7 eV, then the answer is 1e-6 eV (c), since 1 μeV (1e-6 eV) is a bit bigger than 0.66 μeV.\n\nAlternatively, if the options are structured differently, but since we don\'t know, but given the line of thought, 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) is the answer to choose.\n\nSo I should box the number 1e-6 eV, so boxed option would be \\boxed{10^{-6} \\text{ eV}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe energy difference that allows the two states to be clearly resolved is \\boxed{10^{-6} \\text{ eV}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1744973735, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2702, prompt_tokens=1025, total_tokens=3727, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \) seconds and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \) seconds, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the energy uncertainty \( \Delta E \) to the lifetime \( \tau \) by \( \Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau} \).

1. **Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state:**
   - For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \) seconds:
     \[
     \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \approx 0.329 \, \mu\text{eV}
     \]
   - For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \) seconds:
     \[
     \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \approx 0.0329 \, \mu\text{eV}
     \]

2. **Convert uncertainties to line widths (FWHM):**
   - For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} \approx 0.658 \, \mu\text{eV}
     \]
   - For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \) seconds:
     \[
     \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} \approx 0.0658 \, \mu\text{eV}
     \]

3. **Determine the combined uncertainty for resolvability:**
   The energy difference must be greater than the combined uncertainty, calculated using the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual uncertainties:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{\Gamma_1^2 + \Gamma_2^2} = \sqrt{(0.658 \, \mu\text{eV})^2 + (0.0658 \, \mu\text{eV})^2} \approx 0.66 \, \mu\text{eV}
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   To clearly resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference should be greater than approximately \( 0.66 \, \mu\text{eV} \). A practical choice from typical options is \( 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is around 1 μeV.

\[
\boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}
\]

But often Rayleigh is stated when the peaks are of similar width. If the peaks have different widths, the required separation might need to be larger than the average of the two linewidths.

But perhaps here, since we have two energy levels, with uncertainties in their energies due to lifetime, the minimum energy difference to resolve them would be that their energy difference is much larger than the sum of their uncertainties. So, energy difference should be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2, where ΔE1 and ΔE2 computed from Heisenberg. Alternatively, uncertainty in energy difference could be sqrt(ΔE1² +ΔE2²), but it depends on how they combine. Thus, perhaps we need the energy difference |E2 - E1| > (ΔE1 + ΔE2) to clearly resolve.

Alternatively, if the natural linewidth is treated as FWHM of a Lorentzian, and when two Lorentzians with widths Γ1 and Γ2 are considered, the required separation would be on the order of their average line widths.

But perhaps since their lifetimes are individual, let's compute the combined effect. For two energy levels each with linewidths Γ1 and Γ2. If you have a transition between them, that would have a line width of Γ1 + Γ2. However, here the question isn't about a transition but resolving the energies themselves. So if you try to measure E1 and E2, each smeared out by their own linewidth, then the uncertainty in their energies is Γ1 and Γ2. Then the energy difference between them would have a total uncertainty of sqrt(Γ1² + Γ2²), assuming the uncertainties are independent. To resolve the energy levels, the separation ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty. So ΔE > sqrt(Γ1² + Γ2²).

But let's compute Γ1 and Γ2:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / 1e-9 s = 1.0545718e-25 J ≈ 6.582e-7 eV

Γ2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.0545718e-26 J ≈ 6.582e-8 eV

Thus, the uncertainties on energies would be approximately 0.658 μeV and 0.0658 μeV.

So the combined uncertainty would be sqrt( (0.658 μeV)^2 + (0.0658 μeV)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.433 + 0.00433) μeV ≈ sqrt(0.4373) ≈ 0.661 μeV.

So the uncertainty in the energy difference would be around 0.66 μeV. Therefore, to resolve the two energy levels, their energy difference must be greater than this uncertainty. To "clearly" resolve, often the standard is that the peaks should be separated by at least the sum of their FWHM (if considering overlapping peaks) or twice the width. But if relying on statistical uncertainties, like in quantum measurements, you need ΔE_actual > sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²).

So probably, we have the uncertainty in each energy level as Γ1 and Γ2 (with the linewidths). So in order to resolve E1 and E2, the difference |E2-E1| must be larger than sqrt(Γ1² + Γ2²). As per the calculation, sqrt(0.658^2 + 0.0658^2) μeV ≈ 0.66 μeV.

Looking at answer options (which we don't have in the original problem's presented text), but the user is probably expecting the energy difference to be complementary to this uncertainty. However, the problem states "the following options could be their energy difference", but options aren't provided here. The user might still need to evaluate.

Wait, but let's see. Well, perhaps in reality, if you have two energy levels each with a width Γ1 and Γ2, then the requirement for them to be distinguishable is that the energy difference is larger than the widths. Since the widths are approximately 0.658 μeV and 0.0658 μeV, so up to 1e-6 eV. So, the possible answer is around 1e-6 eV. But the possible options might have values like 10^-4 eV, 10^-6 eV, etc.

Alternatively, let's check the numbers once more:

Convert Γ1 and Γ2 to eV:

Γ1 = ħ / τ1. Let me compute:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s

But 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J, so ħ in eV s is 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV s.

Thus Γ1 in eV would be (6.582e-16 eV s) / τ1, where τ1 is 1e-9 s:

Γ1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV ≈ 0.658 μeV

Similarly, Γ2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV ≈ 0.0658 μeV

So As previously found, the linewidths are approx 0.658 μeV and 0.0658 μeV. Let's compute the sum of these: 0.658 + 0.0658 ≈ 0.7238 μeV ≈ 7.24e-7 eV ≈ 0.724 μeV.

Alternatively, considering the average width might be needed or even each individually. For safe resolution, the energy difference should be much larger than these uncertainties. But given the options, perhaps, an answer that's higher than about 1 μeV would work. Let me check the energy-time uncertainty relation again.

Energy-time uncertainty: ΔE ≥ ħ / (2Δt). Δt is the lifetime here, as the characteristic time. So uncertainty in each energy is minimal when you take the maximum observation time as the lifetime? If the two states have lifetimes τ1 and τ2, but when we are trying to measure their energies, the measurement time is presumably limited by their lifetimes, as after that time the state decays. So the uncertainty in energy comes from ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

But for each state, the uncertainty in Energy is roughly about ħ / τ. Thus, if E_1 has ΔE ≈ ħ / τ1 and E_2 has ΔE ≈ ħ / τ2, then the total uncertainty in ΔE between the two would be sqrt( (ħ / τ1)^2 + (ħ / τ2)^2 ). So, the energy difference should be larger that this uncertainty.

So plugging the numbers as in:

∆E_min = sqrt( (ħ / τ1)^2 + (ħ / τ2)^2 )

Calculating that:

= ħ * sqrt(1/τ1² + 1/τ2² )

Substitute τ1 = 1e-9, τ2 =1e-8

= ħ * sqrt(1e18 + 1e16 )

= ħ * sqrt(10^18*(1 + 0.01)) ≈ ħ * 1e9 * sqrt(1.01) ≈ ħ * 1e9 *1.005≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s * 1.005e9 s^-1 ≈ 1.06e-25 J ≈ to eV: (1.06e-25 / 1.6e-19) ≈ 6.625e-7 eV ≈ 0.6625 μeV, which matches prior calculation.

Thus, the energy difference needs to be greater than approximately 0.66 μeV. So if that's the resolution limit, the energy difference must be larger than 0.66 μeV. Hence, in order to clearly resolve the two, their energy difference should be something like 1 μeV (~1e-6 eV) or higher, allowing for clear distinction.

Looking at possible options (which the user hasn't listed here). But typical exam questions for such a problem could offer choices like: 1x10^-4 eV, 1x10^-6 eV, 1x10^-7 eV, etc. The answer will then be around ~1 μeV, so likely option 1e-6 eV.

However, since the problem says "clearly resolved", then perhaps more stringent. Some sources may say peaks can be distinguished when their separation > FWHM maximum, so if ΔE > Γ_max. Here Γ_max is Γ1 = 0.658 μeV ≈ ~0.7 μeV, so to clearly resolve, we need ΔE at least greater than 0.7 μeV.

Assuming the options had comparable values, such as a) 1e-4 eV, b) 1e-5 eV, c) 1e-6 eV, d)1e-7 eV, then the answer is 1e-6 eV (c), since 1 μeV (1e-6 eV) is a bit bigger than 0.66 μeV.

Alternatively, if the options are structured differently, but since we don't know, but given the line of thought, 1e-6 eV (1 μeV) is the answer to choose.

So I should box the number 1e-6 eV, so boxed option would be \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}.

**Final Answer**
The energy difference that allows the two states to be clearly resolved is \boxed{10^{-6} \text{ eV}}.
