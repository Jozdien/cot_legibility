To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by noting that the operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a combination of the Pauli matrices for the x and z components, as the y-component is zero in the x-z plane. 

Given the components of the operator:
- \(P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
- \(P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}\)

The operator along the direction \(\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)\) is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to solve the eigenvalue equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:
1. \((n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0\)
2. \(n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0\)

Solving these equations, we find that \(a = \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b\). Normalizing the eigenvector \([a, b]\) and simplifying, we use the condition \(n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1\). The normalized eigenvector is found to be:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}
\]

This result is verified to be consistent with the standard spin-1/2 eigenstate expressions and checked for edge cases such as directions along the x-axis and z-axis.

### Final Answer
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are:
\[
\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}
\]

Alright, let me try to figure this problem out. So, I need to find the eigenvector of the spin operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane for a muon, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components of P are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z, which are basically the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. But wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of the direction vector should be zero, right? Because if it's lying in the x-z plane, then the n vector would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Alright, so the operator along the direction n is P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. Therefore, the operator simplifies to P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me confirm that again. Yeah, since the direction is arbitrary but within the x-z plane, so y-component is zero. So the operator we're dealing with is a combination of P_x and P_z.

Given that P_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0, 1], [1, 0]], P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So combining these, the operator P·n becomes (ħ/2)*(n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]). Let's write that out:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since the eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, we can write the equation as:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

Let’s denote the eigenvector |ψ> as a two-component vector [a, b]^T. Then the matrix equation becomes:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a

n_x * a - n_z * b = b

So, simplifying the first equation:

n_z a + n_x b = a

→ (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

Second equation:

n_x a - n_z b = b

→ n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

So, we have two equations:

1) (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

2) n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

To solve for a and b, we can set up these equations. Let me write them again:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We can solve this system of equations. Let's express this as a matrix:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x       ] [a]   = [0]

[   n_x    -(n_z +1)  ] [b]     [0]

The determinant of the coefficient matrix should be zero if there's a non-trivial solution, which there must be since it's an eigenvector. Let me compute the determinant to check:

Determinant = (n_z -1)*(-n_z -1) - n_x^2

= -n_z^2 - n_z + n_z +1 - n_x^2

= -n_z² +1 - n_x²

But since n_x² + n_z² =1 (because it's a unit vector), substitute:

= -(n_z² +n_x²) +1 = -1 +1 =0

So determinant is zero, which is consistent. Therefore, the equations are dependent, and we can find non-trivial solutions.

Let's take the first equation: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

Express a in terms of b (assuming n_x ≠0, otherwise we have to handle the case separately):

a = ( -n_x / (n_z -1) ) b

Similarly, substitute into the second equation to verify:

n_x * (-n_x / (n_z -1)) b - (n_z +1) b =0

→ [ -n_x² / (n_z -1) - (n_z +1) ] b =0

Multiply numerator and denominator to combine:

[ (-n_x² - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) ) / (n_z -1) ] b =0

Compute the numerator:

-n_x² - (n_z² -1) = -n_x² -n_z² +1 = -(n_x² +n_z²) +1 = -1 +1=0

Therefore, this equals zero, which confirms that the solution is consistent. Therefore, a = (-n_x / (n_z -1)) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b] = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) * b , b ]

We can choose b=1 for simplicity (since eigenvectors can be scaled), so then a = -n_x / (n_z -1). Therefore, the eigenvector is [ -n_x/(n_z -1), 1 ] , but then we need to normalize it.

Wait, but hold on. The problem asks for the normalized eigenvector. So let's compute the normalization factor.

First, express the vector as components:

Let’s denote the vector components as [ C*(-n_x/(n_z -1)), C*1 ] where C is the normalization constant.

Compute the norm squared:

|C|² * [ (n_x²)/(n_z -1)^2 +1 ] =1

So,

|C|² [ (n_x² + (n_z -1)^2 ) / (n_z -1)^2 ] =1

Okay, compute numerator: n_x² + (n_z -1)^2

Expand (n_z -1)^2: n_z² -2n_z +1

So Numerator = n_x² +n_z² -2n_z +1

But since n_x² +n_z²=1,

Numerator=1 -2n_z +1=2(1 -n_z)

Therefore, the normalization factor squared is |C|² * [ 2(1 -n_z) ] / (n_z -1)^2 = |C|² * 2(1 -n_z)/ (n_z -1)^2

Note that (n_z -1)= -(1 -n_z), so (n_z -1)^2=(1 -n_z)^2. Therefore,

|C|² * 2(1 -n_z) / (1 -n_z)^2 = |C|² * 2 / (1 -n_z) = 1

Hence,

|C| = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But since the normalization constant is positive real, we can take C= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Wait, let me redo that step:

From the equation:

|C|² * 2(1 -n_z)/(1 -n_z)^2 )= |C|² * 2/(1 -n_z) =1

So solving for |C|²= (1 -n_z)/2

Therefore, |C|= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But in the vector expression, the components are:

a= -n_x/(n_z -1) * C= [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But n_z -1= -(1 -n_z), so 1/(n_z -1) = -1/(1 -n_z )

Hence,

a= [ -n_x * (-1/(1 -n_z)) ] * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= (n_x / (1 -n_z)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= n_x / sqrt( 2(1 -n_z) )

Similarly, the other component b=C= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Wait, let's check:

Wait, if |C|²= (1 -n_z)/2, then C can be chosen as real and positive: C= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the components are:

a= (-n_x)/(n_z -1)*C= (-n_x)/(- (1 -n_z)) * C= (n_x/(1 -n_z)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) / (1 -n_z )= n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Similarly, b= C= sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / 2 )

Hence, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ a, b ] = [ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But let's combine these terms:

sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) can be written as sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Similarly, n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) can be written as (n_x) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) )

Alternatively, factoring 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)):

=> [ n_x , (1 -n_z) ] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Wait, no, because the second component is sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

Wait, let's see:

Wait, if we factor 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) out:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

= 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) * [n_x, (1 - n_z) ]

Because sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)^2 / (2(1 -n_z) )) )= (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Wait, no. Alternatively, to factor out 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)):

Let me compute:

First component: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Second component: sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) = sqrt((1 -n_z)/2) = sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2). So this is sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2)

But can we write both terms as multiples of 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ?

Well, maybe. Let's see:

sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)^2 / (2(1 -n_z)) )) ?

No, that isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the vector can be written as:

[ n_x, 1 - n_z ] scaled by some factor.

Wait, let me compute the norm squared of [n_x, 1 -n_z]

Norm squared: n_x² + (1 -n_z)^2

But since n_x² +n_z² =1, so:

n_x² + 1 -2n_z +n_z² = (n_x² +n_z²) +1 -2n_z= 1 +1 -2n_z= 2(1 -n_z)

Therefore, |[n_x, 1 -n_z]|² =2(1 -n_z). Therefore, the normalized vector is [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

But let's check:

Yes, if we have vector v= [n_x, 1 -n_z]

Then v normalized is (1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ) [n_x, 1 -n_z]

But in our previous calculation, we had:

a= n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), and b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2 )

But sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2 )= (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

Therefore, writing the second component as:

sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))= [1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

So then the entire vector is:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ]

Which is equal to [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

So indeed, the normalized eigenvector is [n_x, 1 -n_z] divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

Alternatively, since the two components are:

a = n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

b = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But another way to represent this is in terms of angles. Since the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, we can parameterize it with an angle θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, since in spherical coordinates, if the direction is in the x-z plane (φ=0), then n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y=0.

If we use this parametrization, then n_x= sinθ, n_z=cosθ. Then the vector becomes [sinθ, 1 - cosθ]/sqrt(2(1 - cosθ))

But 1 - cosθ = 2sin²(θ/2), and sqrt(2(1 -cosθ)) = sqrt(4 sin²(θ/2)) = 2 sin(θ/2)

So the denominator is 2 sin(θ/2), and the numerator is [sinθ, 2 sin²(θ/2)]

Expressed this way, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

[a, b] = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), 2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2)] = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]

Therefore, surprisingly, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Is this correct?

Let me check with θ=0 (n along z-axis). Then the eigenvector should be [1,0], which is in the +z direction. And indeed, if θ=0, cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0, so [1,0], which is correct.

For θ=π/2 (along x-axis), cos(π/4)=√2/2, sin(π/4)=√2/2, so the eigenvector would be [√2/2, √2/2], which normalized is correct. The operator along x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], whose eigenvector for +1 eigenvalue is [1,1]/√2. Which matches. So yes, this parametrization works.

Therefore, regardless of θ, the eigenvector can be written as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]

But in the problem, we are asked to present the elements of the normalized eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z.

From the previous expression, [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

So let me write this as:

First component: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Second component: (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Alternatively, as [n_x, 1 -n_z] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

But maybe express using trigonometric functions. Wait, the user probably wants the answer in terms of n_x and n_z, not angles. Since n_x and n_z are given with n_x² + n_z² =1.

Alternatively, they can be expressed in terms of each other. For example, n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²) or n_z= sqrt(1 -n_x²), but given that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, it's better to leave it in terms of n_x and n_z.

Hence, the normalized eigenvector components are:

First component: n_x divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Second component: sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But we can rationalize the expression to have a common denominator. Let me see.

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) in both components.

Wait, first component is n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Second component is sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)^2 / (2(1 -n_z)) ) = (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) )

So if we write both components as (1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))) times [n_x, 1 -n_z]. Therefore, yes, this seems the simplest expression.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ n_x , 1 - n_z ] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Alternatively, this can be written as:

1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) * [n_x, 1 -n_z]

Therefore, the components are n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) and (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

But (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) simplifies to sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

So perhaps the answer is written in terms of each component.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector's first element is n_x divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) and the second element is sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Alternatively, perhaps it's written in a simplified algebraic form.

Alternatively, cross-check using spin-1/2 eigenstates. The eigenstate for spin in the direction n (θ in x-z plane) is:

|+n> = cos(θ/2)|+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|-z>

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ=0 (since it's in x-z plane, φ=0 or π, but since it's a direction in x-z plane with n_x positive or negative depending on θ). Therefore, φ=0, so the eigenvector is:

cos(θ/2)|+z> + sin(θ/2)|-z>

In terms of components, this is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]

Which, in terms of n_x and n_z, as we did earlier, n_x= sinθ, n_z=cosθ

Note that:

cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Similarly, sin(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 - cosθ)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

So |+n> is [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Wait, but that's different from our previous result. Wait hold on, this seems contradictory. Wait, but θ is the angle from the z-axis, so n_z = cosθ, which makes sense.

Then |+n> is:

cos(θ/2)|+z> + sin(θ/2)|-z> = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]

Wait, if we write in the z-basis, then |+z> is [1,0] and |-z> is [0,1]. So the expression is:

cos(θ/2) [1,0] + sin(θ/2) [0,1] = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]

But above, when we solved using the operator approach, we obtained:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But from spin-1/2 eigenstates, we have [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Wait, these two expressions don't look the same. There is a discrepancy here. Which is an issue.

Therefore, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's re-examine the problem. The operator given is P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since P_x and P_z are the spin operators (times ħ/2). For a spin-1/2 system, the spin operator along direction n is (n_x S_x +n_y S_y +n_z S_z), which in the case of n_y=0 becomes n_x S_x +n_z S_z. Then the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. The eigenvectors should be |+n> as given in the z-basis by [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] where θ is the polar angle from z-axis. So in that case, if n is in x-z plane, then:

θ is the angle from z-axis. So n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ. Then the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] which is [sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 ) ] as components.

But according to the operator method earlier, my answer gave [sinθ / sqrt(2(1 -cosθ) ), sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 ) ]

Let’s test θ=180 degrees. If θ=π, which would mean n is along -z direction. But in that case, cosθ= -1, sinθ=0. So the spin eigenvector should be [0,1], since it's pointing in -z. However, in the formula from operator approach:

n_x=0, 1 -n_z=1 - (-1)=2. So vector [0,2]/sqrt(2*2)= [0,2]/2= [0,1], which matches.

From spinor expression: [cos(π/2), sin(π/2)]= [0,1], which also matches. So okay.

When θ=π/2, cosθ=0, sinθ=1. So the direction is along x. The eigenvector should be [1,1]/√2.

From operator approach:

n_x=1, n_z=0

vector [1,1 -0]/sqrt(2(1 -0))= [1,1]/sqrt(2). Correct.

From spinor expression: [cos(π/4), sin(π/4)]= [√2/2,√2/2]. Correct.

Another angle θ=0, cosθ=1, sinθ=0. So eigenvector should be [1,0], which works in both cases.

Therefore, in the operator approach:

We have [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

But let's substitute n_x= sinθ, n_z=cosθ:

 vector becomes [sinθ,1 -cosθ]/sqrt(2(1 -cosθ))

Multiply numerator and denominator:

sinθ /sqrt(2(1 -cosθ)) = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)/ sqrt(2 * 2 sin²(theta/2)) )= 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)/ (2 sin(theta/2) )

Cancel the 2 and sin(theta/2):

= cos(theta/2)/sqrt(2)

Hmm, wait:

Wait, sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin²(theta/2)

Therefore, denominator sqrt(2(1 -cos(theta)) = sqrt(4 sin²(theta/2)) = 2 sin(theta/2)

Therefore,

[sin(theta),1 -cos(theta)]/[2 sin(theta/2)]

= [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), 2 sin²(theta/2)]/[2 sin(theta/2)]

= [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]

Which matches the standard spinor!

Therefore, despite initial discrepancies in component expressions, when accounting for trigonometric identities, the result coincides. Therefore, the expression [n_x,1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) is equivalent to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] when parametrized in terms of theta.

But in the problem statement, they say n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so perhaps they expect the components expressed in terms of n_x and n_z, rather than angles. Therefore, writing the normalized eigenvector as:

[ n_x , 1 - n_z ] divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

Alternatively, we can rationalize the components, but likely the answer is written in terms of n_x and n_z as above.

Alternatively, to express 1 -n_z as something. But since n_x² +n_z² =1, 1 -n_z = (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)/(1 +n_z )= (1 -n_z²)/(1 +n_z )=n_x²/(1 +n_z )

So substituting into the expression:

[n_x, n_x²/(1 +n_z ) ] / sqrt(2*(n_x²/(1 +n_z )) )

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, make the denominator sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) and the numerator components as [n_x,1 -n_z].

Alternatively, considering multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 +n_z)/sqrt(1 +n_z ), then:

[ n_x * sqrt(1 +n_z ), (1 -n_z ) sqrt(1 +n_z ) ]  / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )(1 +n_z )) )

Denominator becomes sqrt(2(1 -n_z²)).

But 1 -n_z² =n_x², so denominator is sqrt(2 n_x²)= |n_x| sqrt(2). Assuming n_x positive, which since direction is arbitrary but in x-z plane, maybe, but not necessarily. If n_x can be positive or negative, depending on the direction.

Thus, this path leads to complications. It's better to leave it as [ n_x ,1 -n_z ] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )).

Hence, the components are:

First element: n_x divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z ))

Second element: (1 -n_z ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) = sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / 2 )

But this seems simplest. Let me check once more with theta = theta， making sure that expression is correct.

For theta = 0, n_z =1, the expression is problematic due to dividing by zero, but in the case of n_z =1, the operator is P_z, so the eigenvector should be [1,0]. However, substituting n_z=1 into our expression, [n_x ,1 -1]/sqrt(0) is [0,0]/0 which is undefined. Hence, another problem arises here. Therefore, our previous derivation might have an error.

Wait, but we need to handle n_z=1 as a special case. If n_z=1, then n_x=0, so the direction is along z-axis. The operator is P_z, whose eigenvectors are [1,0] and [0,1]. For eigenvalue +ħ/2, it's [1,0]. So in this case, the eigenvector is [1,0]. But according to our formula:

When n_z =1, n_x=0, then our expression:

[0, 0]/sqrt(2(0)), which is 0/0. Indeterminate. Hence, in this case, the formula must be treated as a limit as n_z approaches 1 from below. But practically, the expression is problematic at n_z=1.

Similarly, using theta=0, which the previous parameterization in terms of [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] works. But with theta=0, n_z=1, our spinor is [1,0], which is correct, but our component formula fails here. This indicates that while the [n_x,1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) works for n_z ≠1, when n_z=1, it's an edge case.

Similarly, if n_z approaches 1, 1 -n_z approaches 0, so the component 1 -n_z is in the denominator. However, we need to ensure that for all directions in the x-z plane except when pointing exactly along -z (n_z=-1, which might not be in the x-z plane unless it's exactly along -z). Wait, n_z can be from -1 to +1. However, in our earlier calculations, when n_z= -1, 1 -n_z=2, and numerator [n_x,2]. Let's check for theta=π,which is along -z. So in that case, n_z= -1, n_x=0. Then the expression is [0, 2]/sqrt(2*2)= [0,1], which is correct.

But for n_z=1, it's a problem.

Alternatively, could the error be in the eigenvector equation?

Wait, when we derived the eigenvector, we set (P·n - (ħ/2)I)|ψ>=0

Which is equivalent to P·n |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>

But for the operator:

If the direction is along +z, then n_z=1, so P·n = (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The eigenvalue equation becomes: ( [[1,0],[0,-1]] ) |ψ> = |ψ>

Therefore,

[1,0;0,-1][a,b]^T = [a, -b]^T = [a, b]^T.

Therefore, this requires -b = b → b=0. Hence, the eigenvector is [1,0] as expected. But according to our formula, when n_z=1, [n_x/(sqrt(2(1−n_z)) ), sqrt( (1−n_z)/2 ) ] but with n_x=0, so [0,0] which is incorrect.

Therefore, our previous solution was only valid for n_z ≠1. This means that in our derivation, when writing the solution a= -n_x/(n_z -1) b, we assumed that the denominator n_z -1 is not zero, which is equivalent to assuming n_z ≠1. Therefore, when n_z=1, our solution breaks down, and we must treat it separately. But in reality, when n_z=1, we already know that the eigenvector is [1,0], so the general formula must agree with that in the limit as n_z approaches 1.

But our general formula [ n_x, 1 -n_z ] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) has trouble when n_z=1 because it results in 0/0. Hence, this suggests an error in our derivation.

Let me reiterate the steps. So, we started with the equations:

(n_z -1)a +n_x b =0

n_x a + (-n_z -1)b=0

We expressed a in terms of b from the first equation as a= (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b

Then substituted into the second equation and found consistency.

But for n_z=1, this is indeterminate, which suggests that when n_z=1, the equations become (0*a +n_x b=0) and (n_x a -2b=0). If n_z=1 and n_x=0 (along +z), then both equations are 0=0, leaving a and b arbitrary, but we have the condition n_z=1, so the eigenvector is [1,0]. But in the case of n_z=1 and n_x non-zero? Not possible since n_x² +1^2=1 implies n_x=0. Hence, when n_z=1, n_x must be 0.

Therefore, maybe the formula is okay if we take into account at n_z=1, it's a degenerate case. However, our expression in terms of n_x and n_z needs to handle that.

But if our answer must be valid for any direction in the x-z plane (so including the z-axis), then we might need another way of writing.

Alternatively, using the parameterization theta, we have [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which works for all theta, including theta=0, Pi, etc.

Expressed in terms of n_x and n_z, since n_x=sin(theta), n_z=cos(theta), we can write theta/2 functions.

Wait, perhaps writing cos(theta/2)= sqrt( (1 +cos theta)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Similarly, sin(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 -cos theta)/2 )=sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

So, eigenvector is [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

This is different from our previous result of [n_x,1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

But wait, substituting n_x= sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

Then let’s take the expression [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Which is [sqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - cos theta)/2 ) ]

Now compare with [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z ) ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Substituting n_x=sin theta=sqrt(1 -n_z² )

First component: sin theta / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) = sqrt(1 -n_z² ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) )

But since 1 -n_z²=(1 -n_z)(1 +n_z )

So sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z ) ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) )= sqrt( (1 +n_z ) / 2 )

Hence, [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / 2 ) ]

Therefore, we have arrived at the correct expression.

Hence,  conclusion, the normalized eigenvector is [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 ) ]

But also, in the derivation, previously, when we derived the eigenvector as [n_x,1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), after converting n_x into sqrt(1 -n_z²), this expression is equivalent to:

[ sqrt(1 -n_z²),1 -n_z ] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

= [ sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ), (1 -n_z) ] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

= sqrt(1 -n_z ) [ sqrt(1 +n_z ), sqrt(1 -n_z ) ] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

= [ sqrt(1 +n_z ), sqrt(1 -n_z ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Which gives the same as the known spin eigenstate.

Therefore, both approaches yield the same result:

Either [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

Or [ sqrt(1 +n_z ), sqrt(1 -n_z ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Which simplifies to the same components.

Therefore, it's much simpler to present the normalized eigenvector as:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

However, we must confirm this. Let's check this with the case theta=0 (n_z=1):

sqrt( (1 +1)/2 )=sqrt(1)=1, and sqrt( (1 -1)/2 )=0. So eigenvector is [1,0], correct.

For theta= Pi (n_z=-1):

sqrt( (1 +(-1))/2 )=0, sqrt( (1 -(-1))/2 )=sqrt(1)=1. Eigenvector is [0,1], correct.

For theta=Pi/2 (n_z=0):

sqrt(1/2)=sqrt(2)/2, same for the other component. So eigenvector is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2] = [1,1]/sqrt(2), correct.

Hence, this expression is valid for all theta and in terms of n_z. Therefore, likely, this is the correct normalized eigenvector. But in the problem, they probably want it in terms of the vector components, not trigonometric functions. However, since the question states that the direction is along an arbitrary n lying in the x-z plane, which has components n_x and n_z (with n_y=0), so maybe they accept the eigenvector expressed in terms of n_z as above.

Thus, the normalized eigenvector components are sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )

But let's check if this matches with our earlier result, using substitution.

We have as previous:

From operator approach: [n_x , 1 -n_z ] / sqrt( 2(1 -n_z ) )

Let me compute the first component:

n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))= sqrt(1 -n_z² ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z ))= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z )) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z ))= sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 )

Hence, we end up with the first component sqrt( (1 +n_z ) /2 ) and the second component sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )

Therefore, both methods yield the same result, which is essential.

Therefore, the answer should be presented as:

The normalized eigenvector has components:

[ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 ) ]

Expressed as a column vector, this is:

sqrt( (1 + n_z ) /2 )

sqrt( (1 - n_z ) /2 )

But since the problem gives the operator components as matrices, and requires the eigenvector elements in the standard basis (presumably the z-basis), so  the answer is indeed this.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is expected in terms of Euler angles or something else. But likely, given n_z, they are expecting the answer in terms of the directional components. 

Wait, but n_z is part of the unit vector, and there's no other variables. So the answer is given in terms of n_z. Since n_x is expressible in terms of n_z, but they’ve given n_x and n_z as components of the direction vector.

Alternatively, since in the x-z plane, n can be parameterized with theta, but the problem says an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane, but they don’t give theta, so the answer must be in terms of n_x and n_z. Which we had before, as [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Note that in this expression, n_x= sqrt(1 -n_z²), but since it's in the x-z plane and n_x is non-negative? Not necessarily. The direction is arbitrary, so n_x could be positive or negative. For example, theta= 3Pi/2 lies in the x-z plane (if phi=0), and gives n_x= -1, n_z=0. But we need to ensure that our solution accounts for negative n_x.

Wait, but [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ] gives a positive sqrt., so does this account for negative n_x?

Wait, when theta is between Pi and 2Pi, then n_x would be negative, and in that case, the component sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), which, given that n_z can range between -1 and +1, sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) is always non-negative, as sqrt returns the non-negative root. However, the eigenvector along a direction in the x-z plane with n_x negative may involve a negative component.

For example, direction along -x (theta= 3Pi/2). Here, n_z=0, n_x=-1. The eigenvector for this direction should be [1,-1]/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +ħ/2. However, according to our formula sqrt( (1 +0)/2 )= sqrt(1/2 ), and sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )=sqrt(1/2 ), so [sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2)] which is [1,1]/sqrt(2), but that corresponds to theta=Pi/2 (n_x=1).

So if n_x is negative, our formula gives a wrong eigenvector.

Wait, this is a problem.

If the direction is along negative x-axis, so theta=3Pi/2, then according to the standard spinor [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], it would be cos(3Pi/4)= -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3Pi/4)= sqrt(2)/2. So [ -sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ]

But according to our formula, sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

With n_z=0, it gives sqrt(1/2), sqrt(1/2 ). Which is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2] for the eigenvector, which corresponds to theta=Pi/2, which is along x-axis positive. But if theta=3Pi/2, the direction is along negative x-axis. Therefore, the formula gives the eigenvector for +n direction, but theta=3Pi/2 is direction -x, so the eigenvector here should point in the opposite direction.

But spinors have a property that changing the direction by 2Pi flips the sign, but a 4Pi rotation brings them back. However, as per eigenvectors, if I compute the eigenvector for angle theta=3Pi/2 (which points along -x), the eigenvector should be [cos(3Pi/4), sin(3Pi/4)] = [ -sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ]

But according to our formula, since n_z=0 (along x-axis), so n_x=-1 (for -x direction), but in our formula, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ] = [ sqrt( (1 +0)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]= [1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)]

But this is the eigenvector for theta=Pi/2 (along +x). Yet, for the direction theta=3Pi/2 (-x), would substituting n_x=-1 and n_z=0 into our formula [n_x,1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))  result in:

[ -1, 1 ] / sqrt(2(1 -0))= [ -1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2) ]

Which equals [ -sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ], which is correct. But previously, when we tried to parametrize the components as [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ], with n_z=0, gave us [1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2)].

Ah, if we use the formula from the operator approach, [n_x,1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), for direction theta=3Pi/2 (n_z=0, n_x=-1), this gives [ -1,1 ]/sqrt(2)= [ -1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2) ]. But when theta=3Pi/2, the spinor should be [ cos(3Pi/4), sin(3Pi/4) ]= [ -sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ], which matches. Hence, that formula gives the correct eigenvector.

But when we rewrote [n_x,1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) as [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ], that step involved assumptions that might have introduced errors. Specifically, when n_x=sinθ, n_z=cosθ, then for theta between Pi and 2Pi, sinθ would be negative, but if n_x is given as part of the direction vector (in the x-z plane) where n_x could be negative, we cannot use the expression sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ), because n_x would be negative only if theta is between Pi and 2Pi, but the sqrt terms are always positive,  leading to positive components.

Hence, the error arose when parametrizing in terms of theta and converting to sqrt expressions. The correct general expression for the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z (which can be positive or negative) must retain the sign of n_x.

Therefore, the correct normalized eigenvector is [n_x,1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), which, if expressed in terms of theta (θ measured from z-axis), is accurate even for negative n_x.

But when simplifying  [n_x,1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) using trigonometric identities, it is equivalent to [ sinθ/(2 sin(theta/2) ), sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 ) ] which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] if theta is in [0, Pi), but fails for theta in [Pi, 2Pi) where n_x would be negative, but this formula preserves the sign.

Therefore, conclusion, the answer must be written in terms of n_x and n_z with consideration of the sign.

Hence, the normalized eigenvector is [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

But let me verify again for theta=3Pi/2:

n_x= -1, n_z=0.

Eigenvector= [ -1,1 ] / sqrt(2(1 -0 ))= [ -1,1 ]/sqrt(2), which matches the correct eigenvector.

This formula also works when n_z=1. If we approach n_z →1 from below, then the denominator sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) goes to zero, but the numerator:

[n_x, 1 -n_z] → [0,0]. This is an indeterminate form. L’Hospital's Rule cannot apply here because it's in the vector components. But physically, when approaching n_z=1 (along +z), the eigenvector should approach [1,0]. However, when taking the limit as n_z→1, let’s choose n_z=1 -ε with ε→0+.

Then n_x= sqrt(1 - (1 -ε)^2 )= sqrt(2ε -ε² )≈sqrt(2ε).

So components:

n_x ≈sqrt(2ε ), 1 -n_z≈ε

Denominator sqrt(2(1 -n_z ))≈sqrt(2ε )

Thus, [ sqrt(2ε ), ε ] / sqrt(2ε ) ≈ [ sqrt(2ε)/sqrt(2ε ), ε/sqrt(2ε ) ]= [1, sqrt(ε)/sqrt(2) ] →[1,0] as ε→0. Hence, in the limit, the eigenvector approaches [1,0], which matches the desired result.

Similarly, if approaching from n_z>1, but n_z can't be greater than 1 since it's a unit vector. Hence, even though n_z=1 is problematic, as a limit, the expression gives the correct eigenvector.

Therefore, [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) is the correct normalized eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 along direction n in the x-z plane.

Therefore, the answer should be written as a two-component vector with elements:

First element: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Second element: (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But written together as:

[ n_x , 1 -n_z ] divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Hence, the normalized eigenvector is:

1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) * (n_x, 1 -n_z)

Hence, yes, the elements of the normalized eigenvector are:

First element: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z ))

Second element: (1 -n_z ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) = sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 )

Therefore, the elements are [n_x divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z ) /2 ) ]

Alternatively, written as elements within square brackets:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But to express this with a common denominator, we can rationalize it as:

[ n_x, 1 -n_z ] divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z ))

But presented as individual elements, I believe this is the answer.

The problem states "What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" and since this is a quantum mechanics problem, the standard answer for a spin-1/2 eigenvector along direction n is the same as this.

For instance, in the z-basis, the eigenvectors are given in terms of the spherical angles theta and phi. In this case, phi=0 hence e^{i phi}=1. And since theta is the angle from the z-axis, we have the eigenvectors as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

However, expressed in terms of n_x and n_z, n_x=sin theta, n_z=cos theta, so:

cos(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 + cos theta)/2 )=sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

sin(theta/2)=sqrt( (1 - cos theta)/2 )=sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But these are the elements, disregarding the sign of n_x. However, if n_x is negative (theta between pi and 2pi), this parametrization would ignore the sign. However, in reality, for theta between pi and 2pi, we have n_x=sin theta which is negative, but cos(theta/2) can be either positive or negative. However, the spinor components are defined with theta modulo 2pi, but even then, there can be ambiguity in theta/2 or theta/2 + pi.

But given that eigenstates are defined up to a global phase, the formula [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ] assumes that the direction is in the northern hemisphere (theta between 0 and pi), where n_x  այն positive if  theta is in (0, pi). If the direction is in the southern hemisphere (theta between pi and 2pi), n_z=cos theta would be negative, and then the formula  [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ] still yields positive components. However, the original operator derivation gave [n_x,1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) which includes the sign of n_x, thus being valid for all theta. Since in the problem, the direction is "arbitrary", both hemispheres need to be considered.

Therefore, strictly following the linear algebra result, the correct normalized eigenvector is:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), (1 -n_z ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) ]

However, note that in the denominator, 2(1 -n_z) is inside the square root. Hence, properly written, it's sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector elements are:

First component: n_x divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

Second component: (1 -n_z ) divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z )).

But (1 -n_z )/sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) = sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / 2 )

Thus, the final answer must include both components, taking into account the possible negative n_x. Therefore, written as:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 − n_z)), sqrt((1 − n_z)/2) ]

But to check consistency with negative n_x, let’s take n_x negative. If we have direction in the x-z plane with n_x negative and n_z=cos theta, then theta is between pi and 2pi. The eigenvector for such a direction should have the first component negative. According to the first expression, [ n_x/sqrt(2(1−n_z)), sqrt((1−n_z)/2) ], if n_x is negative, then the first element is negative. But in quadrant where theta is between pi and 2pi, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but theta/2 is between pi/2 and pi, where cos(theta/2) is negative. Therefore, [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] has a negative first component, which matches the formula with negative n_x.

Example: theta= 3pi/2. Then theta/2=3pi/4, cos(theta/2)=-sqrt(2)/2, sin(theta/2)=sqrt(2)/2. n_x=sintheta=sin(3pi/2)=-1, n_z= cos(3pi/2)=0. Applying the formula:

First element: (-1)/sqrt(2*(1−0 ))=-1/sqrt(2 ). Second element: sqrt( (1−0)/2)=1/sqrt(2 ). So [-1/sqrt(2 ),1/sqrt(2 )], which matches. So the formula works even when n_x is negative.

Thus, the final answer is:

The elements of the normalized eigenvector are [n_x / sqrt(2(1 − n_z)), sqrt((1 − n_z)/2)].

Writing in LaTeX:

\boxed{\left( \frac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}}, \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \right)}

Or as a column vector:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}

Both are acceptable, but in quantum mechanics, column vectors are standard. Hence, representing as a column vector is appropriate.

Therefore, the answer is:

\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}

This is the normalized eigenvector for the given operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ℏ/2 for a muon's spin along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

**Final Answer**
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Alright, let me try to figure this problem out. So, I need to find the eigenvector of the spin operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane for a muon, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components of P are given as P_x, P_y, and P_z, which are basically the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. But wait, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of the direction vector should be zero, right? Because if it's lying in the x-z plane, then the n vector would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Alright, so the operator along the direction n is P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. Therefore, the operator simplifies to P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me confirm that again. Yeah, since the direction is arbitrary but within the x-z plane, so y-component is zero. So the operator we're dealing with is a combination of P_x and P_z.

Given that P_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0, 1], [1, 0]], P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So combining these, the operator P·n becomes (ħ/2)*(n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]). Let's write that out:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Since the eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, we can write the equation as:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

Let’s denote the eigenvector |ψ> as a two-component vector [a, b]^T. Then the matrix equation becomes:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a

n_x * a - n_z * b = b

So, simplifying the first equation:

n_z a + n_x b = a

→ (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

Second equation:

n_x a - n_z b = b

→ n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

So, we have two equations:

1) (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

2) n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

To solve for a and b, we can set up these equations. Let me write them again:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We can solve this system of equations. Let's express this as a matrix:

[ (n_z -1)   n_x       ] [a]   = [0]

[   n_x    -(n_z +1)  ] [b]     [0]

The determinant of the coefficient matrix should be zero if there's a non-trivial solution, which there must be since it's an eigenvector. Let me compute the determinant to check:

Determinant = (n_z -1)*(-n_z -1) - n_x^2

= -n_z^2 - n_z + n_z +1 - n_x^2

= -n_z² +1 - n_x²

But since n_x² + n_z² =1 (because it's a unit vector), substitute:

= -(n_z² +n_x²) +1 = -1 +1 =0

So determinant is zero, which is consistent. Therefore, the equations are dependent, and we can find non-trivial solutions.

Let's take the first equation: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

Express a in terms of b (assuming n_x ≠0, otherwise we have to handle the case separately):

a = ( -n_x / (n_z -1) ) b

Similarly, substitute into the second equation to verify:

n_x * (-n_x / (n_z -1)) b - (n_z +1) b =0

→ [ -n_x² / (n_z -1) - (n_z +1) ] b =0

Multiply numerator and denominator to combine:

[ (-n_x² - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) ) / (n_z -1) ] b =0

Compute the numerator:

-n_x² - (n_z² -1) = -n_x² -n_z² +1 = -(n_x² +n_z²) +1 = -1 +1=0

Therefore, this equals zero, which confirms that the solution is consistent. Therefore, a = (-n_x / (n_z -1)) b.

So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b] = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) * b , b ]

We can choose b=1 for simplicity (since eigenvectors can be scaled), so then a = -n_x / (n_z -1). Therefore, the eigenvector is [ -n_x/(n_z -1), 1 ] , but then we need to normalize it.

Wait, but hold on. The problem asks for the normalized eigenvector. So let's compute the normalization factor.

First, express the vector as components:

Let’s denote the vector components as [ C*(-n_x/(n_z -1)), C*1 ] where C is the normalization constant.

Compute the norm squared:

|C|² * [ (n_x²)/(n_z -1)^2 +1 ] =1

So,

|C|² [ (n_x² + (n_z -1)^2 ) / (n_z -1)^2 ] =1

Okay, compute numerator: n_x² + (n_z -1)^2

Expand (n_z -1)^2: n_z² -2n_z +1

So Numerator = n_x² +n_z² -2n_z +1

But since n_x² +n_z²=1,

Numerator=1 -2n_z +1=2(1 -n_z)

Therefore, the normalization factor squared is |C|² * [ 2(1 -n_z) ] / (n_z -1)^2 = |C|² * 2(1 -n_z)/ (n_z -1)^2

Note that (n_z -1)= -(1 -n_z), so (n_z -1)^2=(1 -n_z)^2. Therefore,

|C|² * 2(1 -n_z) / (1 -n_z)^2 = |C|² * 2 / (1 -n_z) = 1

Hence,

|C| = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But since the normalization constant is positive real, we can take C= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Wait, let me redo that step:

From the equation:

|C|² * 2(1 -n_z)/(1 -n_z)^2 )= |C|² * 2/(1 -n_z) =1

So solving for |C|²= (1 -n_z)/2

Therefore, |C|= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But in the vector expression, the components are:

a= -n_x/(n_z -1) * C= [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But n_z -1= -(1 -n_z), so 1/(n_z -1) = -1/(1 -n_z )

Hence,

a= [ -n_x * (-1/(1 -n_z)) ] * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= (n_x / (1 -n_z)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

= n_x / sqrt( 2(1 -n_z) )

Similarly, the other component b=C= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Wait, let's check:

Wait, if |C|²= (1 -n_z)/2, then C can be chosen as real and positive: C= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the components are:

a= (-n_x)/(n_z -1)*C= (-n_x)/(- (1 -n_z)) * C= (n_x/(1 -n_z)) * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= n_x * sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) / (1 -n_z )= n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Similarly, b= C= sqrt( (1 -n_z ) / 2 )

Hence, the eigenvector can be written as:

[ a, b ] = [ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But let's combine these terms:

sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) can be written as sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Similarly, n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) can be written as (n_x) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) )

Alternatively, factoring 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)):

=> [ n_x , (1 -n_z) ] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Wait, no, because the second component is sqrt( (1 - n_z)/2 )

Wait, let's see:

Wait, if we factor 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) out:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

= 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) * [n_x, (1 - n_z) ]

Because sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)^2 / (2(1 -n_z) )) )= (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Wait, no. Alternatively, to factor out 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)):

Let me compute:

First component: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Second component: sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) = sqrt((1 -n_z)/2) = sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2). So this is sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2)

But can we write both terms as multiples of 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ?

Well, maybe. Let's see:

sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)^2 / (2(1 -n_z)) )) ?

No, that isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the vector can be written as:

[ n_x, 1 - n_z ] scaled by some factor.

Wait, let me compute the norm squared of [n_x, 1 -n_z]

Norm squared: n_x² + (1 -n_z)^2

But since n_x² +n_z² =1, so:

n_x² + 1 -2n_z +n_z² = (n_x² +n_z²) +1 -2n_z= 1 +1 -2n_z= 2(1 -n_z)

Therefore, |[n_x, 1 -n_z]|² =2(1 -n_z). Therefore, the normalized vector is [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

But let's check:

Yes, if we have vector v= [n_x, 1 -n_z]

Then v normalized is (1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ) [n_x, 1 -n_z]

But in our previous calculation, we had:

a= n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), and b= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2 )

But sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2 )= (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

Therefore, writing the second component as:

sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))= [1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

So then the entire vector is:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ]

Which is equal to [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

So indeed, the normalized eigenvector is [n_x, 1 -n_z] divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z)).

Alternatively, since the two components are:

a = n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

b = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But another way to represent this is in terms of angles. Since the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, we can parameterize it with an angle θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, since in spherical coordinates, if the direction is in the x-z plane (φ=0), then n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, and n_y=0.

If we use this parametrization, then n_x= sinθ, n_z=cosθ. Then the vector becomes [sinθ, 1 - cosθ]/sqrt(2(1 - cosθ))

But 1 - cosθ = 2sin²(θ/2), and sqrt(2(1 -cosθ)) = sqrt(4 sin²(θ/2)) = 2 sin(θ/2)

So the denominator is 2 sin(θ/2), and the numerator is [sinθ, 2 sin²(θ/2)]

Expressed this way, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

[a, b] = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), 2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2)] = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]

Therefore, surprisingly, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Is this correct?

Let me check with θ=0 (n along z-axis). Then the eigenvector should be [1,0], which is in the +z direction. And indeed, if θ=0, cos(0/2)=1, sin(0/2)=0, so [1,0], which is correct.

For θ=π/2 (along x-axis), cos(π/4)=√2/2, sin(π/4)=√2/2, so the eigenvector would be [√2/2, √2/2], which normalized is correct. The operator along x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], whose eigenvector for +1 eigenvalue is [1,1]/√2. Which matches. So yes, this parametrization works.

Therefore, regardless of θ, the eigenvector can be written as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]

But in the problem, we are asked to present the elements of the normalized eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z.

From the previous expression, [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

So let me write this as:

First component: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Second component: (1 -n_z)

# Anthropic completion

Let me analyze this quantum mechanics problem regarding finding the eigenvector of a spin operator. I need to determine the eigenvector of the spin operator P along an arbitrary direction n within the x-z plane for a muon, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Since the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane, it must have components (n_x, 0, n_z) where n_x² + n_z² = 1. Consequently, the operator P·n simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z, as the y-component is zero.

Given that P_x equals (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]] and P_z equals (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]], the operator P·n can be expressed as:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

To find the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2, I need to solve the equation (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, which simplifies to:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |ψ> = |ψ>

If I denote the eigenvector |ψ> as [a, b]^T, this gives me two equations:
1) (n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0

When I calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix, I get -n_z² + 1 - n_x² = 0, which confirms these equations are dependent since n_x² + n_z² = 1.

From the first equation, I can express a in terms of b:
a = (-n_x/(n_z - 1))b

Setting b = 1 for simplicity, the unnormalized eigenvector is [-n_x/(n_z - 1), 1].

To normalize this vector, I need to compute the normalization factor. After calculating the norm squared and simplifying using n_x² + n_z² = 1, I find that the normalization constant C equals sqrt((1-n_z)/2).

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector components are:
a = n_x/sqrt(2(1-n_z))
b = sqrt((1-n_z)/2)

This can be written elegantly as [n_x, 1-n_z]/sqrt(2(1-n_z)).

Using an angular parameterization where n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ (θ being the angle from the z-axis), the eigenvector simplifies to [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]. This result can be verified by checking special cases like θ = 0 (along z-axis) and θ = π/2 (along x-axis).

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector expressed in terms of n_x and n_z is [n_x, 1-n_z]/sqrt(2(1-n_z)).

# OpenAI completion

Okay, I'll work through this. I need to find the eigenvector associated with the spin operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane for a muon, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components of P—P_x, P_y, and P_z—are the Pauli matrices, scaled by ħ/2. Given that n is confined to the x-z plane, n's y-component must be zero. Thus, the n vector can be expressed as (n_x, 0, n_z), satisfying n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Therefore, the operator along direction n is given by P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. With n_y being zero, it simplifies to P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. This means we're considering a combination of P_x and P_z.

For these matrices: P_x = (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli X matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]], and P_z = (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. Hence, P·n becomes (ħ/2) * [n_x * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + n_z * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]], resulting in:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

I need to find the eigenvector for this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2. The eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ〉 = (ħ/2)|ψ〉, written as:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |ψ〉 = |ψ〉

Let eigenvector |ψ〉 be [a, b]^T so that the matrix equation is:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a
n_x * a - n_z * b = b

Simplifying:

n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a - n_z b = b → n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

Thus, we solve these equations:

1) (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

We express this as:

[(n_z - 1)   n_x] [a] = [0]
[  n_x     -(n_z + 1)] [b] = [0]

Since we seek a non-trivial solution, the determinant must be zero:

Determinant = (n_z - 1)(-n_z - 1) - n_x² = -n_z² + 1 - n_x²

Since n_x² + n_z² = 1 for a unit vector:

= -(n_z² + n_x²) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0

This shows consistency, allowing computation of non-trivial a and b.

For (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0, express a in terms of b (assuming n_x ≠ 0):

a = (-n_x / (n_z - 1)) b

And for n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0, substitute in a:

n_x(-n_x / (n_z - 1)) b - (n_z + 1) b = 0

Simplifying confirms equations need only b:

|C|² [ 2(1 - n_z) / (1 - n_z)^2 ] = 1

Therefore, |C| = sqrt((1 - n_z) / 2)

Expressing the vector components:

[a, b] = [-n_x / (n_z - 1) * b, b]

If b = 1 for simplicity (scalable eigenvectors), then:

a = -n_x / (n_z - 1), identifying [a, b] as [-n_x / (n_z - 1), 1]

The normalized eigenvector needs evaluation:

|C|² [ (n_x² + (n_z -1)²) / (n_z -1)²] = 1

Which simplifies, given n_x² + n_z² = 1, to:

[n_x / sqrt(2(1 - n_z)), sqrt((1 - n_z) / 2)]

With the resolved vector as [n_x, 1 - n_z] over sqrt(2(1 - n_z)),

And alternatively, parameterizing using angles in x-z plane: [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] for eigenvector is possible.

Conclusively, the normalized eigenvector expressed with elements n_x and n_z:

[n_x / sqrt(2(1 - n_z)), (1 - n_z) / sqrt(2(1 - n_z))]

Since n_z = cosθ, so sqrt(1 -cosθ)=sqrt(2 sin²(θ/2))=sqrt(2) sin(θ/2). But perhaps that\'s going back to angle parameterization.\n\nBut the problem states "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", so maybe expressing the components in terms of n_x and n_z is acceptable. So, let me express the eigenvector as:\n\n[ (n_x) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nAlternatively, as:\n\n[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ]\n\nWhich is the same as [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))\n\nAlternatively factorizing 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)):\n\n1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) [n_x, 1 -n_z]\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is (n_x, 1 -n_z) divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), so written out:\n\n1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) * [n_x, 1 -n_z]\n\nSo as the components, first element is n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), second element is (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))\n\nAlternatively, if we use trigonometric identities, but unless the problem expects it in terms of angle variables, perhaps expressing it in terms of n_x and n_z is better.\n\nBut another check: let’s test with a simple case. Let’s take n along the z-axis: n_x=0, n_z=1. But wait, if n is along z-axis, then n_z=1, so 1 -n_z=0. Then the eigenvector would be [0,0]/0, which is undefined. Wait, but this can\'t be right. Wait, but n_z=1 gives n_x=0, and the operator becomes P_z. The eigenvectors for P_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [1,0]. So according to the formula when n_z=1:\n\nOur formula gives [0, 1 -1]/sqrt(2*(1 -1)) = [0,0]/0. Division by zero. So clearly, there is a problem when n_z approaches 1.\n\nBut in reality, when n is along z-axis, we can approach that limit. Let\'s take θ approaching 0. Then our general eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which when θ approaches 0, becomes [1, 0], which is correct. But in terms of n_x and n_z, when n_z approaches 1, the denominator becomes sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) which approaches zero. However, the numerator:\n\nFirst component: n_x ~ sinθ ~θ, 1 -n_z ~1 -cosθ ~θ²/2\n\nTherefore, the first component becomes θ / sqrt(2*(θ²/2)))= θ / (θ ) sqrt(1) / sqrt(1)) ~1/sqrt(1). Wait, maybe messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this expression is problematic as n_z approaches 1. But given that for the eigenvector along the z-axis, when n_z=1, you need to handle it separately because the operator becomes diagonal, and eigenvectors are standard basis vectors. Therefore, the general formula should hold for directions not exactly along z-axis, but when n_z=1, the limit needs to be considered.\n\nBut given that we can write the eigenvector as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], where θ is polar angle from z-axis in x-z plane, but parameterizing θ that way, but since the problem says "an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane", perhaps there\'s another way to write the components in terms of n_x and n_z without angles.\n\nBut n_x and n_z are related by n_x² + n_z²=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z as follows.\n\nLet’s say that the eigenvector is [n_x + i0, 1 -n_z], but normalized. Wait, but I need to keep track.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let\'s suppose we take the spin operator in the direction n:\n\nP·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )\n\nAnd we need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let\'s recall that the eigenvectors for a spin-1/2 system in the direction n are given by:\n\n|+n> = cos(θ/2)|0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1>\n\nBut in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is 0, so e^{iφ}=1. Therefore, the eigenvector would be:\n\n|+n> = cos(θ/2)|0> + sin(θ/2)|1>\n\nBut since |0> corresponds to spin-up along z, which is [1,0], and |1> is spin-down, [0,1]. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in standard notation, |+z> is [1,0], and |-z> is [0,1]. But when we prepare a state along direction n, the eigenvector is:\n\n|+n> = cos(θ/2)|+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|-z>\n\nBut if we\'re in the x-z plane, φ=0, so e^{iφ}=1, so:\n\n|+n> = cos(θ/2)|+z> + sin(θ/2)|-z> = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] as a vector.\n\nBut θ is the angle from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So in terms of the unit vector n, which has components n_x= sinθ, n_z= cosθ. So substituting cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_x and n_z.\n\nWe know that sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2) = n_x\n\nAlso, cosθ = n_z = 2cos²(θ/2) -1\n\nTherefore:\n\n1 + n_z = 2 cos²(θ/2)\n\nSo cos²(θ/2) = (1 +n_z)/2\n\nSimilarly, sin²(θ/2)= (1 -n_z)/2\n\nHence, cos(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nAnd sin(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut how does this compare to our previous result?\n\nPreviously, we had:\n\n[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut let\'s substitute n_x = sinθ= 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2) = 2 sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, n_x= 2 * sqrt{( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) /4 }= sqrt(1 -n_z²)= sqrt(n_x² +n_z² -n_z²)=n_x. Hmm, that\'s redundant.\n\nAlternatively, from [ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nLet’s substitute n_x=sinθ and n_z=cosθ:\n\nThen first component: sinθ / sqrt(2(1 -cosθ))= [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / sqrt(2 * 2 sin²(θ/2)) )= [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / (2 sin(θ/2)) )= cos(θ/2 )\n\nSecond component: sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )= sqrt( 2 sin²(θ/2)/2 )= sin(θ/2 )\n\nHence, combining [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which matches the standard result.\n\nSo even though our previous general expression [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) seems a bit unwieldy, when we substitute the parametrization in terms of θ, it simplifies correctly to [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which is the standard result.\n\nBut the problem says "along an arbitrary direction", so we need to present the answer in terms of n_x and n_z, not in terms of θ. So we need to reconcile the two expressions.\n\nBut as per substitution: cos(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nSimilarly, sin(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can also be written as [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nWait, but that can’t be compatible with our previous expression [ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nWait, maybe through the following:\n\nWe have:\n\ncos(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nsin(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nBut the component [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]\n\nExpressed in terms of n_z:\n\n= [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nAlternatively, square both components:\n\nFirst component squared: (1 +n_z)/2\n\nSecond component squared:(1 -n_z)/2\n\nWhich sum to 1. So that’s properly normalized. So this seems to be another way to write the normalized eigenvector. However, how does that compare to our previous expression [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ?\n\nLet’s square the components of both expressions:\n\nFirst expression: [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))]² + [sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]² = n_x²/(2(1 -n_z)) + (1 -n_z)/2 = [n_x² + (1 -n_z)^2 ]/[2(1 -n_z)]\n\nBut n_x²=1 -n_z², so numerator becomes (1 -n_z²) + (1 -2n_z +n_z²)=1 -n_z² +1 -2n_z +n_z²=2(1 -n_z)\n\nTherefore, total squared norm= [2(1 -n_z)]/[2(1 -n_z)]=1, which is correct.\n\nCompare to the second expression, [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ], which squared components sum to (1 +n_z)/2 + (1 -n_z)/2=1, so also normalized.\n\nTherefore, both are correct expressions for the eigenvector. But how to reconcile them?\n\nWait, suppose I express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_x and n_z.\n\nBut in the first component of the eigenvector: cos(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nBut n_z=cosθ. Thus, sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 )=cos(θ/2), which is correct. That\'s the half-angle formula. Similarly, sin(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )\n\nBut then the first term in the eigenvector has a sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) and the second term sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nTherefore, that\'s correct.\n\nBut in our previous expression where we found [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\nFirst component:\n\nn_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) = sinθ / sqrt(2(1 -cosθ)) )\n\nBut sinθ=2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)\n\nAnd denominator sqrt(2(1 -cosθ))=sqrt(4 sin²(θ/2))=2 sin(θ/2)\n\nTherefore, first component= [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ]/[2 sin(θ/2) ] =cos(θ/2)\n\nSimilarly, second component sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )=sin(θ/2)\n\nSo they indeed are equal.\n\nTherefore, both representations are equivalent.\n\nBut the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Therefore, perhaps we can present it as:\n\n[ sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nOr, perhaps factorizing 1/sqrt(2):\n\n[ sqrt(1 +n_z), sqrt(1 -n_z) ] / sqrt(2)\n\nBut since components are [sqrt(1 +n_z)/sqrt(2), sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2)]\n\nAlternatively, to write it in terms of n_x:\n\nGiven that n_x=sinθ and sinθ=2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)\n\nBut from the previous relation,\n\nsqrt(1 +n_z)/sqrt(2)=cos(θ/2)\n\nsqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2)=sin(θ/2)\n\nSo perhaps combining with the previous result where\n\nn_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))= cos(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, since the eigenvector can be either [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] in terms of the polar angle θ, or in terms of n_x and n_z as [ sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 ) ].\n\nAlternatively, using another trigonometric identity. Let’s see:\n\nExpress sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ) as cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nSimilarly, sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 )= sin(theta/2 )\n\nBut since n_z=cos(theta), then theta= arccos(n_z ).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s best to present the eigenvectors in terms of n_x and n_z:\n\nGiven the operator in the x-z plane is meaningful, so the standard result is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] where theta is the angle from the z-axis. Transforming this into cartesian components gives [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ].\n\nBut should there be a relation involving n_x?\n\nAlternatively, since we found that the normalized eigenvector is [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut in this expression, n_x is involved. Let\'s express that with n_x:\n\nThe first component is n_x divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), and the second component is sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nAlternatively, combine these:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\nFirst component: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) = n_x / [sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 -n_z) ]\n\nSecond component: sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) = sqrt(1 -n_z) / sqrt(2 )\n\nThus, factor out 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)):\n\nBut the two components are (n_x, 1 -n_z ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))\n\nSince 1 - n_z is equal to sqrt( (1 -n_z)^2 )\n\nSo maybe written as:\n\n[ n_x + sqrt( (1 -n_z )^2 -n_x² ) ] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) , but that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, since n_x² +n_z² =1, 1 -n_z = (n_x² +n_z²) -n_z = n_x² +n_z(n_z -1 )\n\nNot sure.\n\nWait, can we write the eigenvector as:\n\n[ 1 + n_z, n_x ] Normalizing factor?\n\nBut let’s check the case when n_z=1: gives [2,0]/sqrt( (2)^2 +0 )= [1,0], which is correct.\n\nIf n is along x, n_z=0, n_x=1, then the eigenvector would be [1,1]/sqrt(2). Which is correct.\n\nSo:\n\nCompute the norm squared of [1 +n_z, n_x ]:\n\n(1 +n_z)^2 +n_x² =1 + 2n_z +n_z² +n_x²\n\nSince n_x² +n_z²=1,\n\n=1 + 2n_z +1=2(1 +n_z )\n\nTherefore, normalized vector is [1 +n_z, n_x ] / sqrt(2(1 +n_z ))\n\nWhich is another representation.\n\nBut we can check for θ=0: [1 +1, 0 ] / sqrt(2(2))= [2,0]/2= [1,0], correct.\n\nθ=π/2 (n along x): [1 +0,1]/sqrt(2(1 +0 ))=[1,1]/sqrt(2), correct.\n\nBut how does this relate to the previous expressions?\n\nLet me compute [1 +n_z, n_x ] / sqrt(2(1 +n_z )) versus [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]\n\nExpress in terms of theta:\n\n[1 +cosθ, sinθ]/sqrt(2(1 +cosθ))= [2 cos²(theta/2), 2 sin(theta/2)cos(theta/2)] / sqrt(2*2 cos²(theta/2 )) )\n\n= [2 cos²(theta/2), 2 sin(theta/2)cos(theta/2)] / [2 cos(theta/2 ) ]\n\n= [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nTherefore, this is equivalent! So, [1 +n_z, n_x ] / sqrt(2(1 +n_z )) = [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nTherefore, this gives another expression. But is this compatible with our previously derived one?\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple ways to write the normalized eigenvector.\n\nBut given that the problem mentions that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, but they want the answer in terms of components, perhaps without using angles.\n\nSo, let\'s list the possibilities:\n\n1. In terms of angle θ from z-axis: [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]\n\n2. In terms of n_x and n_z, demonstrated as [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))\n\nBut when we express theta in terms of n_x and n_z, we can get different expressions. But perhaps the exam problem expects the answer in terms of  [n_x and n_z], but the solution can be ambiguous unless we specify theta.\n\nAlternatively, the answer might need to be in the form similar to the bullet point expressions of spin states.\n\nBut given that P_x and P_z are given as Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, which are the standard spin-1/2 operators.\n\nGiven that spin operator along direction n is (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z )ħ/2. We have to find its +ħ/2 eigenvector.\n\nStandard expression for the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]\n\nBut since n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta). Therefore, theta = arcsin(n_x ). But theta/2= (1/2)arcsin(n_x ). But it might be messy.\n\nAlternatively, use trigonometric identities.\n\nAlternatively, notice that [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] can be written as [ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) , sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBecause:\n\n1 +n_z=1 +cosθ= 2cos²(theta/2 )\n\n1 -n_z=1 -cosθ=2 sin²(theta/2 )\n\nTherefore, sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )=cos(theta/2 )\n\nsqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sin(theta/2 )\n\nThus, plugging these in, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut simplified. So written out:\n\nFirst component: sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 )\n\nSecond component: sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 )\n\nBut verifying this with n_x:\n\nBut since n_x= sin(theta )\n\nBut sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 )= sin(theta/2 )\n\nSo n_x= sin(theta )= 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )= 2 sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 )\n\n= 2 * sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)/4 )= sqrt( 1 -n_z² )= sqrt(n_x² )= |n_x |\n\nBut since n_x can be positive or negative, but theta is between 0 and pi, so sin(theta ) is non-negative. Wait, in the x-z plane, direction n can point in any direction, so theta from 0 to pi, meaning n_x = sin(theta ) is non-negative. But if theta is measured from the positive z-axis towards positive x-axis. But actually, theta can be from 0 to 2pi, but in the x-z plane, but with phi=0 or pi. Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so n_x can be positive or negative. Hmm.\n\nBut in θ measured from the z-axis, theta is between 0 to pi, but direction in x-z plane could have positive or negative x-component. Wait, but to cover negative x, phi would be pi, but the half-angle formulas get a bit messed up.\n\nActually, perhaps we need to be careful here. If n is in x-z plane, we can take theta as the angle from the positive z-axis, and phi=0 if n_x is positive (towards +x), and phi=pi if n_x is negative (towards -x). So the theta would still be between 0 and pi.\n\nBut in the eigenvector expression |+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|-z>\n\nBut if phi=0 or pi, then e^{i phi}=1 or -1. However, in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane with phi=0 (since the problem didn\'t specify a y-component). But depending on which hemisphere, phi can be 0 or pi.\n\nBut actually, if n is in x-z plane, phi is 0 for +x and pi for -x. Alternatively, theta can range from 0 to pi, and the x-component is given by n_x = sin(theta ), but signed?\n\nWait, confusion arises here.\n\nIf we parameterize in spherical coordinates, theta is from 0 to pi, phi from 0 to 2pi.\n\nBut in the x-z plane, phi=0 (for +x direction) or phi=pi (for -x direction). Theta is still from 0 (along +z) to pi (along -z).\n\nTherefore, n_x = sin(theta ) cos(phi )\n\nBut in x-z plane, phi=0 or pi.\n\nTherefore, n_x= sin(theta ) if phi=0 (pointing towards +x)\n\nor n_x= -sin(theta ) if phi=pi (pointing towards -x )\n\nSo, depending on phi, the eigenvector becomes cos(theta/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1>\n\nFor phi=0, it\'s [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nFor phi=pi, it\'s [cos(theta/2 ), -sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nBut since in the problem statement, direction n is ARBITRARY in the x-z plane, including both positive and negative x directions. So by allowing theta from 0 to pi, and phi=0 or pi, but no, phi is fixed if we take standard.\n\nWait, actually, when theta is from 0 to pi, and phi=0, it would account for all directions in the x-z half-plane with positive x. For negative x, we need theta from 0 to pi and phi=pi, but theta=pi/2, phi=pi would point along -x.\n\nAlternatively, parametrizing all in x-z plane using theta or other angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps theta can be from 0 to 2pi, but the elevation angle.\n\nBut I might be overcomplicating.\n\nCrucially, the eigenvector must adjust to the direction n which could be in any direction in the x-z plane, so n_x can be positive or negative. But in the current problem, since we have a direction vector n with components (n_x,0,n_z), and n_x² +n_z²=1. Therefore, n_x can be positive or negative.\n\nIn our previous eigenvector derived from the equations: [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut in this expression, if n_x is negative, then the first component becomes negative.\n\nBut let\'s test when phi=pi (n_x negative):\n\nSay theta is measured from z-axis, but direction n is along -x, so theta= pi/2, phi=pi. Then the spin eigenvector should be [cos(pi/4 ), e^{i pi} sin(pi/4 ) ]= [sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2]\n\nUsing our formula with n_x= -1 (since phi=pi, but theta=pi/2 )\n\nWait, but hold on. If n is along -x, components are (n_x,0,n_z)=(-1,0,0 )\n\nBut according to our general eigenvector written as [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut n_z=0 here, so this becomes [ -1 / sqrt(2*(1 -0)) , sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ] = [ -1/sqrt(2), sqrt(1/2) ]= [-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nWhich is [ -1,1 ] /sqrt(2), which is correct. Because the eigenvector of σ_x for eigenvalue +1 is [1,1]/sqrt(2). But if n is along -x, then the operator is -σ_x * ħ/2. So shouldn\'t the eigenvector for +ħ/2 be the -1 eigenvector of σ_x ?\n\nWait a second. Wait, maybe this is an inconsistency. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the operator along direction n is P·n= ħ/2 (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z )\n\nIf n is along -x direction, then n_x=-1, n_z=0. So the operator becomes -ħ/2 σ_x.\n\nWe need the eigenvector of -σ_x with eigenvalue +1. Because P·n= -ħ/2 σ_x, eigenvalue equation: -ħ/2 σ_x |ψ> = +ħ/2 |ψ> ⇒ -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ> ⇒ The eigenvalues of -σ_x are -1 and +1, so for eigenvalue +1, σ_x |ψ> =-|ψ>\n\nSo |ψ> is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. The eigenvectors of σ_x are [1,1]/sqrt(2) for +1 and [1,-1]/sqrt(2) for -1.\n\nThus, the eigenvector of -σ_x with eigenvalue +1 is [1,-1]/sqrt(2)= [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nBut according to our formula, when n is along -x, n_x=-1, n_z=0.\n\nSo the eigenvector according to our general expression is:\n\n[n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\n= [ -1/sqrt(2(1 -0)), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]\n\n= [ -1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nWhich is [ -1,1 ] / sqrt(2 ), which is actually the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. But we needed the eigenvector of -σ_x with eigenvalue +1, which is [1,-1]/sqrt(2 ). But this is not matching. Wait, so there might be a sign error somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalue equation.\n\nWait, the problem states that the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator P·n is (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z )* ħ/2. For the direction along -x, n_x=-1, we have:\n\nP·n= (-σ_x ) * ħ/2\n\nThen eigenvalues are (-σ_x ) * ħ/2. Therefore, eigenvalues are (+1 and -1) * ħ/2.\n\nEigenvalue equation: (-σ_x ) ħ/2 |psi> = (ħ/2)|psi> ⇒ -σ_x |psi> = |psi> ⇒ σ_x |psi> = -|psi>\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is the one with σ_x eigenvalue -1, which is [1,-1]/sqrt(2 )\n\nBut our general expression gave [ -1,1 ]/sqrt(2 ), which is actually [1,-1]/sqrt(2 ) multiplied by -1. But eigenvector is only defined up to a phase factor. Since multiplying by -1 still gives a valid eigenvector. But the sign might be flipped.\n\nHowever, depending on the parametrization, when n is along -x, theta becomes 3pi/2 if measured from z-axis, but theta in usual spherical coordinates is between 0 to pi. So when moving beyond phi=0/pi, we might have to adjust the formulae.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in our parametrization, theta goes beyond pi? Phi is fixed at 0?\n\nBut complexity arises here. Hence, perhaps we should double-check our result.\n\nIn the case of n along -x n_x=-1, n_z=0, the eigenvector according to our expression is [ -1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2) ]\n\nBut the correct eigenvector is [1,-1]/sqrt(2 )\n\nBut they differ by a phase factor of -1. As eigenvectors are defined up to a global phase, both are valid. However, sometimes a convention is followed for the overall phase.\n\nBut here\'s the thing: if we parametrize using theta as the polar angle from the z-axis, when moving around the sphere, care must be taken with the sign. But if the direction is in the x-z plane with phi=0 or pi, then some conventions are needed. However, based on our previous derivation, the result was:\n\n[e^{i phi /2} cos(theta/2 ), e^{-i phi /2} sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nBut since phi=0 or pi in the x-z plane.\n\nTherefore, if phi=0:\n\n[ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nIf phi=pi:\n\n[ e^{i pi /2} cos(theta/2 ), e^{-i pi/2} sin(theta/2 ) ] = [i cos(theta/2 ), -i sin(theta/2 ) ]\n\nBut these have complex phases, but the original problem didn\'t mention anything about phases. In the problem statement, the operator only has real components? Because n is along x-z plane, so operator P·n is a real matrix? Wait: P·n = n_x sigma_x * ħ/2 + n_z sigma_z * ħ/2, which in matrix form is real if n_x and n_z are real, which they are. Therefore, the eigenvector can be chosen as real. Therefore, the standard result is that in the x-z plane, the eigenvector can be written with real components, without complex phases.\n\nTherefore, in the case of -x, perhaps the eigenvector is [1,-1]/sqrt(2 ), but our expression gave [ -1,1 ]/sqrt(2 ), which is actually -1 times that. Since eigenvectors can be multiplied by -1 and still be valid, this is acceptable.\n\nBut why does our general formula give a different sign? Let me see.\n\nIn our derivation, when n_x is negative, n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) is negative. For n along -x, n_z=0, so first component is -1/sqrt(2(1 -0))=-1/sqrt(2 ), and the second component is sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )=1/sqrt(2 ). Therefore, the eigenvector is [-1/sqrt(2 ),1/sqrt(2 )]. Meanwhile, the standard eigenvector of sigma_x with eigenvalue -1 is [1,-1]/sqrt(2 ).\n\nBut is [-1,1]/sqrt(2 ) also an eigenvector of sigma_x? Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Applying sigma_x to [-1,1]:\n\n[0* -1 +1*1 , 1* -1 +0*1 ] = [1, -1 ] = -1* [-1,1 ]\n\nTherefore, yes, sigma_x*[-1,1 ]= [1,-1 ]= -1*[-1,1 ]\n\nTherefore, [-1,1 ] is an eigenvector of sigma_x with eigenvalue -1. So it\'s just a scaling by -1 from [1,-1 ]\n\nEither way, it\'s a valid eigenvector.\n\nTherefore, the discrepancy is only in the overall sign, which is arbitrary. Hence, the formula we derived is correct.\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector for operator P·n in x-z plane with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is:\n\n[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]\n\nTherefore, written as:\n\n[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]\n\nAlternatively, written as:\n\n1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) * [ n_x, (1 -n_z ) ]\n\nThis vector is normalized because:\n\nNorm squared: (n_x² + (1 -n_z )² ) / (2(1 -n_z )) )\n\nSince n_x² =1 -n_z²,\n\nNorm squared= (1 -n_z² +1 -2n_z +n_z² ) /2(1 -n_z )= (2 -2n_z ) /2(1 -n_z )= 1, as required.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector components are:\n\nFirst component: n_x divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z )),\n\nSecond component: sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 )\n\nHowever, to present this in terms of the components as required, likely they are:\n\n[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]\n\nBut the problem specifies that the answer should be the elements of the normalized eigenvector, so these two components. However, to write it in a more compact form, if possible. Alternatively, they might need to be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions, but since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, they probably want it in terms of n_x and n_z. Therefore, the elements are:\n\nFirst element: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )),\n\nSecond element: sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 )\n\nAlternatively, using trigonometric identities to replace n_x and n_z with an angle, but since it\'s not requested, and as per the problem statement, direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, expressed in terms of n_x and n_z.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want it expressed in terms of spherical coordinates angles, but since it\'s in the x-z plane, polar angle theta from z-axis with phi=0.\n\nBut since the problem statement doesn\'t specify using angles, rather gives the operator components with matrices, I think the answer should be as:\n\n[ (n_x ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]\n\nThus, we can write the normalized eigenvector as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{n_x}{\\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\\\\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nBut before finalizing, let\'s test for a simple case. For example, if n is along the x-axis (n_z=0, n_x=1). Then the eigenvector should be [1,1]/sqrt(2 ).

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by expressing the operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) in terms of the given Pauli matrices.

Given:
- The operator components are \(P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\), \(P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(P_y = 0\) since \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane.
- The direction vector \(\vec{n}\) has components \((n_x, 0, n_z)\) with \(n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1\).

The operator along \(\vec{n}\) is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + n_z \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This leads to the system of equations:
1. \(n_z a + n_x b = a\)
2. \(n_x a - n_z b = b\)

Solving these equations, we express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) from the first equation:
\[
(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0 \implies a = \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b
\]

Substituting \(a\) into the second equation confirms consistency. The eigenvector can be written as:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} b
\]

Normalizing the eigenvector, we find:
\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = \left( \frac{n_x^2}{(1 - n_z)^2} + 1 \right) |b|^2 = 1
\]

Simplifying using \(n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1\), we get:
\[
\frac{n_x^2 + (1 - n_z)^2}{(1 - n_z)^2} |b|^2 = \frac{2(1 - n_z)}{(1 - n_z)^2} |b|^2 = \frac{2}{1 - n_z} |b|^2 = 1 \implies |b| = \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \frac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}
\]

### Final Answer
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}.

/ sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) )

Simplify the second component:

(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) = sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2)

But alternatively:

sqrt(1 -n_z) can be expressed in terms of the angle θ. Since n_z = cosθ, so sqrt(1 -cosθ)=sqrt(2 sin²(θ/2))=sqrt(2) sin(θ/2). But perhaps that's going back to angle parameterization.

But the problem states "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane", so maybe expressing the components in terms of n_x and n_z is acceptable. So, let me express the eigenvector as:

[ (n_x) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Alternatively, as:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ]

Which is the same as [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Alternatively factorizing 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)):

1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) [n_x, 1 -n_z]

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (n_x, 1 -n_z) divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), so written out:

1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) * [n_x, 1 -n_z]

So as the components, first element is n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), second element is (1 -n_z)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Alternatively, if we use trigonometric identities, but unless the problem expects it in terms of angle variables, perhaps expressing it in terms of n_x and n_z is better.

But another check: let’s test with a simple case. Let’s take n along the z-axis: n_x=0, n_z=1. But wait, if n is along z-axis, then n_z=1, so 1 -n_z=0. Then the eigenvector would be [0,0]/0, which is undefined. Wait, but this can't be right. Wait, but n_z=1 gives n_x=0, and the operator becomes P_z. The eigenvectors for P_z with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is [1,0]. So according to the formula when n_z=1:

Our formula gives [0, 1 -1]/sqrt(2*(1 -1)) = [0,0]/0. Division by zero. So clearly, there is a problem when n_z approaches 1.

But in reality, when n is along z-axis, we can approach that limit. Let's take θ approaching 0. Then our general eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which when θ approaches 0, becomes [1, 0], which is correct. But in terms of n_x and n_z, when n_z approaches 1, the denominator becomes sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) which approaches zero. However, the numerator:

First component: n_x ~ sinθ ~θ, 1 -n_z ~1 -cosθ ~θ²/2

Therefore, the first component becomes θ / sqrt(2*(θ²/2)))= θ / (θ ) sqrt(1) / sqrt(1)) ~1/sqrt(1). Wait, maybe messy.

Alternatively, perhaps this expression is problematic as n_z approaches 1. But given that for the eigenvector along the z-axis, when n_z=1, you need to handle it separately because the operator becomes diagonal, and eigenvectors are standard basis vectors. Therefore, the general formula should hold for directions not exactly along z-axis, but when n_z=1, the limit needs to be considered.

But given that we can write the eigenvector as [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], where θ is polar angle from z-axis in x-z plane, but parameterizing θ that way, but since the problem says "an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane", perhaps there's another way to write the components in terms of n_x and n_z without angles.

But n_x and n_z are related by n_x² + n_z²=1.

Alternatively, perhaps express the eigenvector in terms of n_x and n_z as follows.

Let’s say that the eigenvector is [n_x + i0, 1 -n_z], but normalized. Wait, but I need to keep track.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's suppose we take the spin operator in the direction n:

P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )

And we need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's recall that the eigenvectors for a spin-1/2 system in the direction n are given by:

|+n> = cos(θ/2)|0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1>

But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ is 0, so e^{iφ}=1. Therefore, the eigenvector would be:

|+n> = cos(θ/2)|0> + sin(θ/2)|1>

But since |0> corresponds to spin-up along z, which is [1,0], and |1> is spin-down, [0,1]. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in standard notation, |+z> is [1,0], and |-z> is [0,1]. But when we prepare a state along direction n, the eigenvector is:

|+n> = cos(θ/2)|+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|-z>

But if we're in the x-z plane, φ=0, so e^{iφ}=1, so:

|+n> = cos(θ/2)|+z> + sin(θ/2)|-z> = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] as a vector.

But θ is the angle from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So in terms of the unit vector n, which has components n_x= sinθ, n_z= cosθ. So substituting cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_x and n_z.

We know that sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2) = n_x

Also, cosθ = n_z = 2cos²(θ/2) -1

Therefore:

1 + n_z = 2 cos²(θ/2)

So cos²(θ/2) = (1 +n_z)/2

Similarly, sin²(θ/2)= (1 -n_z)/2

Hence, cos(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

And sin(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But how does this compare to our previous result?

Previously, we had:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But let's substitute n_x = sinθ= 2 sin(θ/2)cos(θ/2) = 2 sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Therefore, n_x= 2 * sqrt{( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) /4 }= sqrt(1 -n_z²)= sqrt(n_x² +n_z² -n_z²)=n_x. Hmm, that's redundant.

Alternatively, from [ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Let’s substitute n_x=sinθ and n_z=cosθ:

Then first component: sinθ / sqrt(2(1 -cosθ))= [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / sqrt(2 * 2 sin²(θ/2)) )= [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / (2 sin(θ/2)) )= cos(θ/2 )

Second component: sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )= sqrt( 2 sin²(θ/2)/2 )= sin(θ/2 )

Hence, combining [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which matches the standard result.

So even though our previous general expression [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) seems a bit unwieldy, when we substitute the parametrization in terms of θ, it simplifies correctly to [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which is the standard result.

But the problem says "along an arbitrary direction", so we need to present the answer in terms of n_x and n_z, not in terms of θ. So we need to reconcile the two expressions.

But as per substitution: cos(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Similarly, sin(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, the eigenvector can also be written as [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Wait, but that can’t be compatible with our previous expression [ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Wait, maybe through the following:

We have:

cos(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

sin(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

But the component [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]

Expressed in terms of n_z:

= [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Alternatively, square both components:

First component squared: (1 +n_z)/2

Second component squared:(1 -n_z)/2

Which sum to 1. So that’s properly normalized. So this seems to be another way to write the normalized eigenvector. However, how does that compare to our previous expression [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ?

Let’s square the components of both expressions:

First expression: [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))]² + [sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]² = n_x²/(2(1 -n_z)) + (1 -n_z)/2 = [n_x² + (1 -n_z)^2 ]/[2(1 -n_z)]

But n_x²=1 -n_z², so numerator becomes (1 -n_z²) + (1 -2n_z +n_z²)=1 -n_z² +1 -2n_z +n_z²=2(1 -n_z)

Therefore, total squared norm= [2(1 -n_z)]/[2(1 -n_z)]=1, which is correct.

Compare to the second expression, [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ], which squared components sum to (1 +n_z)/2 + (1 -n_z)/2=1, so also normalized.

Therefore, both are correct expressions for the eigenvector. But how to reconcile them?

Wait, suppose I express cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2) in terms of n_x and n_z.

But in the first component of the eigenvector: cos(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

But n_z=cosθ. Thus, sqrt( (1 +cosθ)/2 )=cos(θ/2), which is correct. That's the half-angle formula. Similarly, sin(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 -cosθ)/2 )

But then the first term in the eigenvector has a sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) and the second term sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Therefore, that's correct.

But in our previous expression where we found [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

First component:

n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) = sinθ / sqrt(2(1 -cosθ)) )

But sinθ=2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

And denominator sqrt(2(1 -cosθ))=sqrt(4 sin²(θ/2))=2 sin(θ/2)

Therefore, first component= [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ]/[2 sin(θ/2) ] =cos(θ/2)

Similarly, second component sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )=sin(θ/2)

So they indeed are equal.

Therefore, both representations are equivalent.

But the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. Therefore, perhaps we can present it as:

[ sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Or, perhaps factorizing 1/sqrt(2):

[ sqrt(1 +n_z), sqrt(1 -n_z) ] / sqrt(2)

But since components are [sqrt(1 +n_z)/sqrt(2), sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2)]

Alternatively, to write it in terms of n_x:

Given that n_x=sinθ and sinθ=2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

But from the previous relation,

sqrt(1 +n_z)/sqrt(2)=cos(θ/2)

sqrt(1 -n_z)/sqrt(2)=sin(θ/2)

So perhaps combining with the previous result where

n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))= cos(θ/2)= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Hmm, this is getting a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, since the eigenvector can be either [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] in terms of the polar angle θ, or in terms of n_x and n_z as [ sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 ) ].

Alternatively, using another trigonometric identity. Let’s see:

Express sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ) as cos(theta/2) = sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

Similarly, sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 )= sin(theta/2 )

But since n_z=cos(theta), then theta= arccos(n_z ).

Alternatively, perhaps it's best to present the eigenvectors in terms of n_x and n_z:

Given the operator in the x-z plane is meaningful, so the standard result is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] where theta is the angle from the z-axis. Transforming this into cartesian components gives [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ].

But should there be a relation involving n_x?

Alternatively, since we found that the normalized eigenvector is [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But in this expression, n_x is involved. Let's express that with n_x:

The first component is n_x divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), and the second component is sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 )

Alternatively, combine these:

Multiply numerator and denominator:

First component: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) = n_x / [sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 -n_z) ]

Second component: sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) = sqrt(1 -n_z) / sqrt(2 )

Thus, factor out 1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)):

But the two components are (n_x, 1 -n_z ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Since 1 - n_z is equal to sqrt( (1 -n_z)^2 )

So maybe written as:

[ n_x + sqrt( (1 -n_z )^2 -n_x² ) ] / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) , but that complicates.

Alternatively, since n_x² +n_z² =1, 1 -n_z = (n_x² +n_z²) -n_z = n_x² +n_z(n_z -1 )

Not sure.

Wait, can we write the eigenvector as:

[ 1 + n_z, n_x ] Normalizing factor?

But let’s check the case when n_z=1: gives [2,0]/sqrt( (2)^2 +0 )= [1,0], which is correct.

If n is along x, n_z=0, n_x=1, then the eigenvector would be [1,1]/sqrt(2). Which is correct.

So:

Compute the norm squared of [1 +n_z, n_x ]:

(1 +n_z)^2 +n_x² =1 + 2n_z +n_z² +n_x²

Since n_x² +n_z²=1,

=1 + 2n_z +1=2(1 +n_z )

Therefore, normalized vector is [1 +n_z, n_x ] / sqrt(2(1 +n_z ))

Which is another representation.

But we can check for θ=0: [1 +1, 0 ] / sqrt(2(2))= [2,0]/2= [1,0], correct.

θ=π/2 (n along x): [1 +0,1]/sqrt(2(1 +0 ))=[1,1]/sqrt(2), correct.

But how does this relate to the previous expressions?

Let me compute [1 +n_z, n_x ] / sqrt(2(1 +n_z )) versus [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]

Express in terms of theta:

[1 +cosθ, sinθ]/sqrt(2(1 +cosθ))= [2 cos²(theta/2), 2 sin(theta/2)cos(theta/2)] / sqrt(2*2 cos²(theta/2 )) )

= [2 cos²(theta/2), 2 sin(theta/2)cos(theta/2)] / [2 cos(theta/2 ) ]

= [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Therefore, this is equivalent! So, [1 +n_z, n_x ] / sqrt(2(1 +n_z )) = [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Therefore, this gives another expression. But is this compatible with our previously derived one?

Yes.

Therefore, there are multiple ways to write the normalized eigenvector.

But given that the problem mentions that the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, but they want the answer in terms of components, perhaps without using angles.

So, let's list the possibilities:

1. In terms of angle θ from z-axis: [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]

2. In terms of n_x and n_z, demonstrated as [n_x, 1 -n_z]/sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

But when we express theta in terms of n_x and n_z, we can get different expressions. But perhaps the exam problem expects the answer in terms of  [n_x and n_z], but the solution can be ambiguous unless we specify theta.

Alternatively, the answer might need to be in the form similar to the bullet point expressions of spin states.

But given that P_x and P_z are given as Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2, which are the standard spin-1/2 operators.

Given that spin operator along direction n is (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z )ħ/2. We have to find its +ħ/2 eigenvector.

Standard expression for the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But since n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta). Therefore, theta = arcsin(n_x ). But theta/2= (1/2)arcsin(n_x ). But it might be messy.

Alternatively, use trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, notice that [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] can be written as [ sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 ) , sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Because:

1 +n_z=1 +cosθ= 2cos²(theta/2 )

1 -n_z=1 -cosθ=2 sin²(theta/2 )

Therefore, sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )=cos(theta/2 )

sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sin(theta/2 )

Thus, plugging these in, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But simplified. So written out:

First component: sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 )

Second component: sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 )

But verifying this with n_x:

But since n_x= sin(theta )

But sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 )= sin(theta/2 )

So n_x= sin(theta )= 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )= 2 sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 )

= 2 * sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)/4 )= sqrt( 1 -n_z² )= sqrt(n_x² )= |n_x |

But since n_x can be positive or negative, but theta is between 0 and pi, so sin(theta ) is non-negative. Wait, in the x-z plane, direction n can point in any direction, so theta from 0 to pi, meaning n_x = sin(theta ) is non-negative. But if theta is measured from the positive z-axis towards positive x-axis. But actually, theta can be from 0 to 2pi, but in the x-z plane, but with phi=0 or pi. Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so n_x can be positive or negative. Hmm.

But in θ measured from the z-axis, theta is between 0 to pi, but direction in x-z plane could have positive or negative x-component. Wait, but to cover negative x, phi would be pi, but the half-angle formulas get a bit messed up.

Actually, perhaps we need to be careful here. If n is in x-z plane, we can take theta as the angle from the positive z-axis, and phi=0 if n_x is positive (towards +x), and phi=pi if n_x is negative (towards -x). So the theta would still be between 0 and pi.

But in the eigenvector expression |+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|-z>

But if phi=0 or pi, then e^{i phi}=1 or -1. However, in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane with phi=0 (since the problem didn't specify a y-component). But depending on which hemisphere, phi can be 0 or pi.

But actually, if n is in x-z plane, phi is 0 for +x and pi for -x. Alternatively, theta can range from 0 to pi, and the x-component is given by n_x = sin(theta ), but signed?

Wait, confusion arises here.

If we parameterize in spherical coordinates, theta is from 0 to pi, phi from 0 to 2pi.

But in the x-z plane, phi=0 (for +x direction) or phi=pi (for -x direction). Theta is still from 0 (along +z) to pi (along -z).

Therefore, n_x = sin(theta ) cos(phi )

But in x-z plane, phi=0 or pi.

Therefore, n_x= sin(theta ) if phi=0 (pointing towards +x)

or n_x= -sin(theta ) if phi=pi (pointing towards -x )

So, depending on phi, the eigenvector becomes cos(theta/2)|0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1>

For phi=0, it's [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

For phi=pi, it's [cos(theta/2 ), -sin(theta/2 ) ]

But since in the problem statement, direction n is ARBITRARY in the x-z plane, including both positive and negative x directions. So by allowing theta from 0 to pi, and phi=0 or pi, but no, phi is fixed if we take standard.

Wait, actually, when theta is from 0 to pi, and phi=0, it would account for all directions in the x-z half-plane with positive x. For negative x, we need theta from 0 to pi and phi=pi, but theta=pi/2, phi=pi would point along -x.

Alternatively, parametrizing all in x-z plane using theta or other angle.

Alternatively, perhaps theta can be from 0 to 2pi, but the elevation angle.

But I might be overcomplicating.

Crucially, the eigenvector must adjust to the direction n which could be in any direction in the x-z plane, so n_x can be positive or negative. But in the current problem, since we have a direction vector n with components (n_x,0,n_z), and n_x² +n_z²=1. Therefore, n_x can be positive or negative.

In our previous eigenvector derived from the equations: [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But in this expression, if n_x is negative, then the first component becomes negative.

But let's test when phi=pi (n_x negative):

Say theta is measured from z-axis, but direction n is along -x, so theta= pi/2, phi=pi. Then the spin eigenvector should be [cos(pi/4 ), e^{i pi} sin(pi/4 ) ]= [sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2]

Using our formula with n_x= -1 (since phi=pi, but theta=pi/2 )

Wait, but hold on. If n is along -x, components are (n_x,0,n_z)=(-1,0,0 )

But according to our general eigenvector written as [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But n_z=0 here, so this becomes [ -1 / sqrt(2*(1 -0)) , sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ] = [ -1/sqrt(2), sqrt(1/2) ]= [-1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]

Which is [ -1,1 ] /sqrt(2), which is correct. Because the eigenvector of σ_x for eigenvalue +1 is [1,1]/sqrt(2). But if n is along -x, then the operator is -σ_x * ħ/2. So shouldn't the eigenvector for +ħ/2 be the -1 eigenvector of σ_x ?

Wait a second. Wait, maybe this is an inconsistency. Let me clarify.

If the operator along direction n is P·n= ħ/2 (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z )

If n is along -x direction, then n_x=-1, n_z=0. So the operator becomes -ħ/2 σ_x.

We need the eigenvector of -σ_x with eigenvalue +1. Because P·n= -ħ/2 σ_x, eigenvalue equation: -ħ/2 σ_x |ψ> = +ħ/2 |ψ> ⇒ -σ_x |ψ> = |ψ> ⇒ The eigenvalues of -σ_x are -1 and +1, so for eigenvalue +1, σ_x |ψ> =-|ψ>

So |ψ> is the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. The eigenvectors of σ_x are [1,1]/sqrt(2) for +1 and [1,-1]/sqrt(2) for -1.

Thus, the eigenvector of -σ_x with eigenvalue +1 is [1,-1]/sqrt(2)= [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2) ]

But according to our formula, when n is along -x, n_x=-1, n_z=0.

So the eigenvector according to our general expression is:

[n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

= [ -1/sqrt(2(1 -0)), sqrt( (1 -0)/2 ) ]

= [ -1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]

Which is [ -1,1 ] / sqrt(2 ), which is actually the eigenvector of σ_x with eigenvalue -1. But we needed the eigenvector of -σ_x with eigenvalue +1, which is [1,-1]/sqrt(2 ). But this is not matching. Wait, so there might be a sign error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenvalue equation.

Wait, the problem states that the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator P·n is (n_x σ_x +n_z σ_z )* ħ/2. For the direction along -x, n_x=-1, we have:

P·n= (-σ_x ) * ħ/2

Then eigenvalues are (-σ_x ) * ħ/2. Therefore, eigenvalues are (+1 and -1) * ħ/2.

Eigenvalue equation: (-σ_x ) ħ/2 |psi> = (ħ/2)|psi> ⇒ -σ_x |psi> = |psi> ⇒ σ_x |psi> = -|psi>

Therefore, the eigenvector is the one with σ_x eigenvalue -1, which is [1,-1]/sqrt(2 )

But our general expression gave [ -1,1 ]/sqrt(2 ), which is actually [1,-1]/sqrt(2 ) multiplied by -1. But eigenvector is only defined up to a phase factor. Since multiplying by -1 still gives a valid eigenvector. But the sign might be flipped.

However, depending on the parametrization, when n is along -x, theta becomes 3pi/2 if measured from z-axis, but theta in usual spherical coordinates is between 0 to pi. So when moving beyond phi=0/pi, we might have to adjust the formulae.

Alternatively, maybe in our parametrization, theta goes beyond pi? Phi is fixed at 0?

But complexity arises here. Hence, perhaps we should double-check our result.

In the case of n along -x n_x=-1, n_z=0, the eigenvector according to our expression is [ -1/sqrt(2),1/sqrt(2) ]

But the correct eigenvector is [1,-1]/sqrt(2 )

But they differ by a phase factor of -1. As eigenvectors are defined up to a global phase, both are valid. However, sometimes a convention is followed for the overall phase.

But here's the thing: if we parametrize using theta as the polar angle from the z-axis, when moving around the sphere, care must be taken with the sign. But if the direction is in the x-z plane with phi=0 or pi, then some conventions are needed. However, based on our previous derivation, the result was:

[e^{i phi /2} cos(theta/2 ), e^{-i phi /2} sin(theta/2 ) ]

But since phi=0 or pi in the x-z plane.

Therefore, if phi=0:

[ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

If phi=pi:

[ e^{i pi /2} cos(theta/2 ), e^{-i pi/2} sin(theta/2 ) ] = [i cos(theta/2 ), -i sin(theta/2 ) ]

But these have complex phases, but the original problem didn't mention anything about phases. In the problem statement, the operator only has real components? Because n is along x-z plane, so operator P·n is a real matrix? Wait: P·n = n_x sigma_x * ħ/2 + n_z sigma_z * ħ/2, which in matrix form is real if n_x and n_z are real, which they are. Therefore, the eigenvector can be chosen as real. Therefore, the standard result is that in the x-z plane, the eigenvector can be written with real components, without complex phases.

Therefore, in the case of -x, perhaps the eigenvector is [1,-1]/sqrt(2 ), but our expression gave [ -1,1 ]/sqrt(2 ), which is actually -1 times that. Since eigenvectors can be multiplied by -1 and still be valid, this is acceptable.

But why does our general formula give a different sign? Let me see.

In our derivation, when n_x is negative, n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) is negative. For n along -x, n_z=0, so first component is -1/sqrt(2(1 -0))=-1/sqrt(2 ), and the second component is sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )=1/sqrt(2 ). Therefore, the eigenvector is [-1/sqrt(2 ),1/sqrt(2 )]. Meanwhile, the standard eigenvector of sigma_x with eigenvalue -1 is [1,-1]/sqrt(2 ).

But is [-1,1]/sqrt(2 ) also an eigenvector of sigma_x? Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Applying sigma_x to [-1,1]:

[0* -1 +1*1 , 1* -1 +0*1 ] = [1, -1 ] = -1* [-1,1 ]

Therefore, yes, sigma_x*[-1,1 ]= [1,-1 ]= -1*[-1,1 ]

Therefore, [-1,1 ] is an eigenvector of sigma_x with eigenvalue -1. So it's just a scaling by -1 from [1,-1 ]

Either way, it's a valid eigenvector.

Therefore, the discrepancy is only in the overall sign, which is arbitrary. Hence, the formula we derived is correct.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector for operator P·n in x-z plane with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

Therefore, written as:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

Alternatively, written as:

1/sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) * [ n_x, (1 -n_z ) ]

This vector is normalized because:

Norm squared: (n_x² + (1 -n_z )² ) / (2(1 -n_z )) )

Since n_x² =1 -n_z²,

Norm squared= (1 -n_z² +1 -2n_z +n_z² ) /2(1 -n_z )= (2 -2n_z ) /2(1 -n_z )= 1, as required.

Therefore, the eigenvector components are:

First component: n_x divided by sqrt(2(1 -n_z )),

Second component: sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 )

However, to present this in terms of the components as required, likely they are:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

But the problem specifies that the answer should be the elements of the normalized eigenvector, so these two components. However, to write it in a more compact form, if possible. Alternatively, they might need to be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions, but since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, they probably want it in terms of n_x and n_z. Therefore, the elements are:

First element: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )),

Second element: sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 )

Alternatively, using trigonometric identities to replace n_x and n_z with an angle, but since it's not requested, and as per the problem statement, direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, expressed in terms of n_x and n_z.

Alternatively, maybe they want it expressed in terms of spherical coordinates angles, but since it's in the x-z plane, polar angle theta from z-axis with phi=0.

But since the problem statement doesn't specify using angles, rather gives the operator components with matrices, I think the answer should be as:

[ (n_x ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

Thus, we can write the normalized eigenvector as:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\
\sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

But before finalizing, let's test for a simple case. For example, if n is along the x-axis (n_z=0, n_x=1). Then the eigenvector should be [1,1]/sqrt(2 ). Our formula gives:

First component: 1 / sqrt(2*(1 -0 ))= 1/sqrt(2 )

Second component: sqrt( (1 -0)/2 )=1/sqrt(2 )

Hence, [1/sqrt(2 ),1/sqrt(2 )], which is correct.

If n is along z-axis (n_z=1, but we need to take the limit). Let's take n_z approaching 1. Then 1 -n_z approaches 0.

First component: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) becomes 0/sqrt(0 )) which is 0/0, but taking the limit as n_z->1 from below. n_x approaches 0. Let's take n_z=1 -ε, ε->0+. Then n_x= sqrt(1 -(1 -ε )² )= sqrt(2ε -ε² )≈sqrt(2ε )

Then first component≈ sqrt(2ε ) / sqrt(2*ε )= sqrt(2ε ) / sqrt(2 ) sqrt(ε )=1/sqrt(1 )

Second component≈ sqrt( ε /2 )≈0

Hence, eigenvector approaches [1,0], which is correct.

Another check: n is along the line theta=60 degrees from z-axis. Then n_z=cos(60°)=0.5, n_x=sin(60°)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866

Calculating eigenvector with our formula:

First component: (sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(2*(1 -0.5 ))= (sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(1 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866/2≈0.433

Second component: sqrt( (1 -0.5)/2 )=sqrt(0.25 )=0.5

Normalizing factor check: sqrt( (sqrt(3)/2 )² + (0.5 )² )= sqrt( 3/4 +1/4 )=sqrt(1)=1. Correct.

But the eigenvector should be [cos(30°), sin(30° )]= [sqrt(3)/2≈0.866,0.5]

Wait, but our formula gives [sqrt(3)/2 /1, 0.5 ]

Wait, no. Wait, Wait:

If theta=60°, theta/2=30°, so eigenvector is [cos(30°), sin(30° ) ]

But according to our formula,

First component: n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z ))= (sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(2*(1 -0.5 ))= (sqrt(3)/2 ) / sqrt(1 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866≈cos(30° )

Second component: sqrt( (1 -0.5)/2 )=sqrt(0.25 )=0.5=sin(30° )

Therefore, yes, the formula gives components [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Therefore, even in component this seems compatible.

Hence, the final answer is:

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \begin{pmatrix} n_x \\ 1 - n_z \end{pmatrix}
$$

or, writing out the elements explicitly,

$$
\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}
$$

This is the normalized eigenvector for the given operator corresponding to the +ħ/2 eigenvalue.


**Final Answer**
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}} \\ \sqrt{\dfrac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

Given a quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) lying in the x-z plane, we need to find the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). The components of the operator \(\vec{P}\) are given by the Pauli matrices scaled by \(\hbar/2\).

The operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\) in the x-z plane (where \(n_y = 0\)) is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + n_z \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we solve:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This results in the equations:
1. \(n_z a + n_x b = a\)
2. \(n_x a - n_z b = b\)

Solving these equations, we express \(a\) in terms of \(b\):
\[
a = \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b
\]

Choosing \(b = \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}\) for normalization, we find:
\[
a = \frac{n_x}{\sqrt{2(1 - n_z)}}
\]

Normalizing the vector \([a, b]^T\), we use the condition \(n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1\) and trigonometric identities (letting \(n_x = \sin\theta\) and \(n_z = \cos\theta\)), leading to the normalized eigenvector:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}} \\ \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \end{pmatrix}
\]

### Final Answer
The elements of the normalized eigenvector are \boxed{\left(\sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}}, \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}} \right)}.

However, given that n_x² + n_z² = 1 and 1 - n_z = 2sin²(θ/2), using trigonometric identities confirms that the standard normalized eigenvector for spin in direction n is [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ}sin(θ/2)], but since the direction is in the x-z plane (φ=0), the eigenvector becomes [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)], which aligns with the previous results when expressed in terms of n_z and n_x.

But after full calculation, believe elements are [n_z + 1, n_x] divided by a normalization factor.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different approach. If I denote θ as the angle between the direction n and the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Then the eigenvector can be written as a two-component vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] right? Because for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvector of the spin operator along a direction making angle θ with z-axis is given in terms of θ/2 angles.\n\nHence, using this angle parametrization, the normalized eigenvector would have elements [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]. But need to convert back to n_x and n_z terms. Since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, then use trigonometric identities: cos(θ/2) = sqrt[(1 + cosθ)/2] = sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), and sin(θ/2) = sqrt[(1 - cosθ)/2] = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2). But also, sinθ = n_x, so:\n\nIf I use the spherical coordinates approach since the vector n is in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal) is 0 or π, so with n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.\n\nSo the standard spin-1/2 eigenvector in direction (θ, φ=0) is:\n\ne^{-iφ/2} [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]^T = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T since φ=0.\n\nTherefore, substituting θ in terms of n_z and n_x, where cosθ = n_z, sinθ = n_x.\n\nTherefore, in terms of n_z, cos(θ/2) would be sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2], sin(θ/2) = sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2]. So the normalized eigenvector components are:\n\n[sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)]\n\nBut we can also write n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) which equals 2 sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2] sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] = sqrt(1 - n_z²)/1, but with n_x² + n_z² =1, that's correct.

So:\n\nLeft side is sqrt{(1 +n_z)/2} *1, while right side is a = sqrt{(1 +n_z)/2}. So it's equal. Similarly for the second equation. \n\nLet's check the second equation:\n\nn_x a -n_z b = sqrt(1 -n_z^2) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) - n_z* sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nCompute first term: sqrt((1 -n_z^2)(1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)(1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)^2 /2 )= (1 +n_z) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nSecond term: n_z sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nThus, equation:\n\nLeft side: (1 +n_z) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) -n_z sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= [ (1 +n_z -n_z ) ] sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) = b \n\nWhich is equal to the right side (since b = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )). So both equations hold. \n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n1/sqrt(2) [sqrt(1 + n_z), sqrt(1 - n_z) ]\n\nBut also, since n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ, so sqrt(1 +n_z) becomes sqrt(2 cos²(θ/2)) = sqrt(2) cos(θ/2), similarly sqrt(1 -n_z)=sqrt(2 sin²(θ/2))=sqrt(2) sin(θ/2). Therefore, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]\n\nExpressed in terms of n_z and n_x. We can also express the components explicitly in terms of n_z. Let me check:\n\nn_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2 * [sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]* [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) ] = 2 * sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) / 2 ) = sqrt(1 -n_z² )\n\nWhich holds.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the normalized eigenvector has components [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut maybe written in terms of the components of the direction vector n. Since n is (n_x, 0, n_z), unit vector, then 1 -n_z = (1 - n_z), and so the elements in terms of n_x or n_z. Alternatively, can express it parametrically in terms of n_x and n_z. But note that since n_x and n_z satisfy n_x² + n_z² =1, so 1 -n_z^2= n_x^2.\n\nWait, but here we have 1 -n_z as (1 -n_z). Oh, wait, perhaps in terms of n_x and n_z, sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) can be expressed differently. For example, multiplying numerator and denominator inside sqrt by (1 -n_z):\n\nsqrt( (1 +n_z)(1 -n_z)/ (2(1 -n_z)) ) )= sqrt( (1 -n_z²)/ (2(1 -n_z)) ) )= sqrt(n_x² / (2(1 -n_z)) )= |n_x| / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))\n\nAssuming n_x positive (since direction in x-z plane, could make sense, given maybe θ between 0 and π? But perhaps n_x: positive or negative. So, if n_x is positive, then:\n\nsqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )\n\nBut if n_x can be negative, then n_z is from -1 to 1. Hmm. But regardless, the standard parametrization is such that irrespective of the sign.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps writing it in terms of n_x and n_z using the fact that for direction (n_x, 0, n_z), the eigenvector is:\n\n[ (n_z + 1)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), n_x/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ]\n\nBut this would need to check.\n\nAlternatively, let's verify with units.\n\nIf take the eigenvector as [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nThen squared norm is (1 +n_z)/2 + (1 -n_z)/2 = (1 +n_z +1 -n_z)/2 = 2/2 =1, so that's properly normalized.\n\nAlternatively, note that component 1 +n_z over 2. In terms of the vector given in x-z plane, with n_x and n_z. So to answer the question: The elements of the normalized eigenvector are sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ). But is there another way to present it?\n\nLet me see the problem again: n is arbitrary direction in x-z plane. So θ is angle from z-axis, and normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].\n\nBut θ in terms of n_z is n_z=cosθ, then:\n\ncos(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sin(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )\n\nHence, the eigenvector components are [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nFurthermore, because n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2 sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt(1 -n_z² )= sqrt(n_x² )= |n_x| . So actual relationship is maintained.\n\nAlternatively, re-express the components in terms of n_x and n_z, considering the possible sign. But as the problem states that the spin direction is along +n, so presumably, if we're looking for the spin-up state along n, the eigenvector components are [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ] which can also be written as [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ] with φ=0 here (since in x-z plane, phi=0).\n\nHence, there's no complex phase here. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:\n\n1/sqrt(2) times [ sqrt(1 +n_z), sqrt(1 -n_z) ]\n\nBut  sqrt(1 +n_z) and sqrt(1 -n_z ) are coordinates.

For +ħ/2 eigenvector, solving ([[n_z -1, n_x],[n_x, -n_z -1 ]])[a, b] = [0,0]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n(n_z -1)a + n_x b = 0\n\nn_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0\n\nTaking the first equation: a = -n_x b/(n_z -1)\n\nPlugging into second equation:\n\nn_x (-n_x b / (n_z -1)) + (-n_z -1) b =0\n\nMultiply through by (n_z -1):\n\n-n_x² b - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) b =0 =>\n[ -n_x² - (n_z² -1) ] b =0.\n\nBut n_x² + n_z²=1, so -n_x² -n_z² +1 = - (n_x² + n_z²) +1= -1 +1=0. So equations are consistent.\n\nThus, ratio of a to b: a/b = -n_x / (n_z -1 )\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector is proportional to [ -n_x, (n_z -1 ) ]\n\nWait this needs a check. Wait:\n\nIf a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b. Let’s take b = 1, then a = -n_x / (n_z -1 )\n\nThus, the eigenvector is [ -n_x/(n_z -1 ), 1 ]\n\nBut we need to normalize:\n\nNorm^2 = (n_x² )/(n_z -1 )² + 1 = (n_x² + (n_z -1 )² ) / (n_z -1 )².\n\nCompute numerator: n_x² + (n_z -1 )²= n_x² + n_z² -2n_z +1. But n_x² + n_z² =1. Hence, numerator= 1 -2n_z +1= 2(1 -n_z )\n\nTherefore, norm squared is 2(1 -n_z ) / (n_z -1 )² = 2(1 -n_z ) / (1 -n_z )²= 2 / (1 -n_z ).\n\nThus, norm is sqrt(2/(1 -n_z )).\n\nHence, the eigenvector is:\n\n1/sqrt(2/(1 -n_z )) * [ -n_x/(n_z -1 ), 1 ]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\nsqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) * [ -n_x/(n_z -1 ), 1 ]\n\nNote that (n_z -1 )= -(1 -n_z ), so:\n\nsqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) * [ n_x/(1 -n_z ), 1 ]\n\n= [ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]\n\nWhich is what we derived earlier.\n\nBut in the previous parametrization, we had [ sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]\n\nNote that here's s difference in sign maybe depending on phase conventions. Let me see:\n\n[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt((1 -n_z )/2 ) ]\n\nBut since n_x^2 =1 -n_z^2, so n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z^2 ), but actual value of n_x can be positive or negative. So if we take into account the sign of n_x.\n\nComparing this to the previous parametrization [ sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]\n\nn_x = sqrt(1 - n_z^2 ), which equals sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z ) )\n\nHence, substituting in the first component:\n\nn_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) )= sqrt( (1 -n_z )(1 +n_z ) ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) )= sqrt( (1 +n_z ) / 2 ), which matches the first component.\n\nTherefore, [ sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 ) ]= [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt((1 -n_z )/2 ) ]\n\nSo they’re equivalent. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nBut to express this in terms of n_x and n_z, since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, 1 +n_z = n_z +1, and sqrt((1 +n_z )/2). But if the problem accepts the answer in trigonometric terms dependent on an angle, but since the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, but and the answer needs to be given in terms of n_x and n_z. Therefore, the elements are [sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 ) ]\n\nThere's no dependence on i or complex numbers here because the eigenvector can be chosen to be real in the x-z plane (since it's a real linear combination of σ_x and σ_z, φ=0). So the final answer is the normalized eigenvector with components sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ) and sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 ).\n\nAlternatively, writing them as fractions and square roots, but it's more concise to express in terms of n_z.\n\nHencebox:\n\nThe normalized eigenvector elements are sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] and sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2].

To find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \(\vec{P}\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \(\vec{n}\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\), we start by expressing the operator \(\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}\). Given that \(\vec{n}\) lies in the x-z plane, we have \(\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)\) with \(n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1\).

The components of the operator \(\vec{P}\) are proportional to the Pauli matrices:
- \(P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}\)
- \(P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}\)

The operator along the direction \(\vec{n}\) is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} + n_z \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\). The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\]

This gives the system of equations:
1. \((n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0\)
2. \(n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0\)

Solving these equations, we find the eigenvector in terms of \(n_x\) and \(n_z\). By parameterizing \(\vec{n}\) using the angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis, we get \(n_x = \sin\theta\) and \(n_z = \cos\theta\). The normalized eigenvector for the eigenvalue \(+\hbar/2\) is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Expressing this in terms of \(n_x\) and \(n_z\), we use trigonometric identities:
- \(\cos(\theta/2) = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}}\)
- \(\sin(\theta/2) = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}\)

Thus, the normalized eigenvector elements are:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}}} \quad \text{and} \quad \boxed{\sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}}
\]

simplifies via n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z²) but the exact components depend on normalization. But after full calculation, believe elements are [n_z + 1, n_x] divided by a normalization factor.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. If I denote θ as the angle between the direction n and the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Then the eigenvector can be written as a two-component vector [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] right? Because for spin-1/2 particles, the eigenvector of the spin operator along a direction making angle θ with z-axis is given in terms of θ/2 angles.

Hence, using this angle parametrization, the normalized eigenvector would have elements [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]. But need to convert back to n_x and n_z terms. Since n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, then use trigonometric identities: cos(θ/2) = sqrt[(1 + cosθ)/2] = sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), and sin(θ/2) = sqrt[(1 - cosθ)/2] = sqrt((1 - n_z)/2). But also, sinθ = n_x, so:

If I use the spherical coordinates approach since the vector n is in the x-z plane, the angle φ (azimuthal) is 0 or π, so with n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So the standard spin-1/2 eigenvector in direction (θ, φ=0) is:

e^{-iφ/2} [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]^T = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T since φ=0.

Therefore, substituting θ in terms of n_z and n_x, where cosθ = n_z, sinθ = n_x.

Therefore, in terms of n_z, cos(θ/2) would be sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2], sin(θ/2) = sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2]. So the normalized eigenvector components are:

[sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)]

But we can also write n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) which equals 2 sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2] sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] = sqrt(1 - n_z²)/1, but with n_x² + n_z² =1, that's correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, check the components. Given that if the eigenvector is [sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)], let's see if this satisfies the equation:

Take [a, b] = [sqrt((1 + n_z)/2), sqrt((1 - n_z)/2)]

Check if:

n_z a + n_x b = (sqrt((1 + n_z)/2)) n_z + sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) n_x 

Given that n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z^2):

Substituting n_x:

n_z sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) + sqrt(1 - n_z²) sqrt((1 - n_z)/2) 

= sqrt((1 + n_z)/2) n_z + sqrt( (1 - n_z²)(1 -n_z)/2 )

Simplify second term:

sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 + n_z)(1 -n_z)/2 ) = sqrt( (1 -n_z)^2 (1 + n_z)/2 ) = (1 - n_z) sqrt( (1 + n_z)/2 )

Wait, but we have:

First term: sqrt{(1 + n_z)/2} *n_z

Second term: (1 -n_z) sqrt{(1 +n_z)/2 }

Adding: sqrt{(1 +n_z)/2} [n_z + (1 -n_z) ] = sqrt{(1 +n_z)/2} *1

Which equals sqrt{(1 +n_z)/2} .

But according to the eigenvalue equation:

n_z a + n_x b =a ?

But sqrt{(1 +n_z)/2}= (a). So:

Left side is sqrt{(1 +n_z)/2} *1, while right side is a = sqrt{(1 +n_z)/2}. So it's equal. Similarly for the second equation. 

Let's check the second equation:

n_x a -n_z b = sqrt(1 -n_z^2) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) - n_z* sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Compute first term: sqrt((1 -n_z^2)(1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)(1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)^2 /2 )= (1 +n_z) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Second term: n_z sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Thus, equation:

Left side: (1 +n_z) sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) -n_z sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= [ (1 +n_z -n_z ) ] sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) = b 

Which is equal to the right side (since b = sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )). So both equations hold. 

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Which can be written as:

1/sqrt(2) [sqrt(1 + n_z), sqrt(1 - n_z) ]

But also, since n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ, so sqrt(1 +n_z) becomes sqrt(2 cos²(θ/2)) = sqrt(2) cos(θ/2), similarly sqrt(1 -n_z)=sqrt(2 sin²(θ/2))=sqrt(2) sin(θ/2). Therefore, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Expressed in terms of n_z and n_x. We can also express the components explicitly in terms of n_z. Let me check:

n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2 * [sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]* [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) ] = 2 * sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) / 2 ) = sqrt(1 -n_z² )

Which holds.

So the conclusion is that the normalized eigenvector has components [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But maybe written in terms of the components of the direction vector n. Since n is (n_x, 0, n_z), unit vector, then 1 -n_z = (1 - n_z), and so the elements in terms of n_x or n_z. Alternatively, can express it parametrically in terms of n_x and n_z. But note that since n_x and n_z satisfy n_x² + n_z² =1, so 1 -n_z^2= n_x^2.

Wait, but here we have 1 -n_z as (1 -n_z). Oh, wait, perhaps in terms of n_x and n_z, sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) can be expressed differently. For example, multiplying numerator and denominator inside sqrt by (1 -n_z):

sqrt( (1 +n_z)(1 -n_z)/ (2(1 -n_z)) ) )= sqrt( (1 -n_z²)/ (2(1 -n_z)) ) )= sqrt(n_x² / (2(1 -n_z)) )= |n_x| / sqrt(2(1 -n_z))

Assuming n_x positive (since direction in x-z plane, could make sense, given maybe θ between 0 and π? But perhaps n_x: positive or negative. So, if n_x is positive, then:

sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )

But if n_x can be negative, then n_z is from -1 to 1. Hmm. But regardless, the standard parametrization is such that irrespective of the sign.

Alternatively, perhaps writing it in terms of n_x and n_z using the fact that for direction (n_x, 0, n_z), the eigenvector is:

[ (n_z + 1)/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)), n_x/sqrt(2(1 -n_z)) ]

But this would need to check.

Alternatively, let's verify with units.

If take the eigenvector as [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Then squared norm is (1 +n_z)/2 + (1 -n_z)/2 = (1 +n_z +1 -n_z)/2 = 2/2 =1, so that's properly normalized.

Alternatively, note that component 1 +n_z over 2. In terms of the vector given in x-z plane, with n_x and n_z. So to answer the question: The elements of the normalized eigenvector are sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ) and sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ). But is there another way to present it?

Let me see the problem again: n is arbitrary direction in x-z plane. So θ is angle from z-axis, and normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But θ in terms of n_z is n_z=cosθ, then:

cos(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sin(θ/2)=sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 )

Hence, the eigenvector components are [ sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

Furthermore, because n_x = sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) = 2 sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) * sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 )= sqrt(1 -n_z² )= sqrt(n_x² )= |n_x| . So actual relationship is maintained.

Alternatively, re-express the components in terms of n_x and n_z, considering the possible sign. But as the problem states that the spin direction is along +n, so presumably, if we're looking for the spin-up state along n, the eigenvector components are [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ] which can also be written as [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ] with φ=0 here (since in x-z plane, phi=0).

Hence, there's no complex phase here. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is:

1/sqrt(2) times [ sqrt(1 +n_z), sqrt(1 -n_z) ]

But  sqrt(1 +n_z) and sqrt(1 -n_z ) are coordinates. Alternatively, can factor differently.

Wait, another approach: if the operator is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z )/2 * ħ. Then matrix is [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]] as we had.

Then the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. For +ħ/2 eigenvector, solving ([[n_z -1, n_x],[n_x, -n_z -1 ]])[a, b] = [0,0]

Which gives:

(n_z -1)a + n_x b = 0

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b =0

Taking the first equation: a = -n_x b/(n_z -1)

Plugging into second equation:

n_x (-n_x b / (n_z -1)) + (-n_z -1) b =0

Multiply through by (n_z -1):

-n_x² b - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) b =0 =>
[ -n_x² - (n_z² -1) ] b =0.

But n_x² + n_z²=1, so -n_x² -n_z² +1 = - (n_x² + n_z²) +1= -1 +1=0. So equations are consistent.

Thus, ratio of a to b: a/b = -n_x / (n_z -1 )

Therefore, the eigenvector is proportional to [ -n_x, (n_z -1 ) ]

Wait this needs a check. Wait:

If a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b. Let’s take b = 1, then a = -n_x / (n_z -1 )

Thus, the eigenvector is [ -n_x/(n_z -1 ), 1 ]

But we need to normalize:

Norm^2 = (n_x² )/(n_z -1 )² + 1 = (n_x² + (n_z -1 )² ) / (n_z -1 )².

Compute numerator: n_x² + (n_z -1 )²= n_x² + n_z² -2n_z +1. But n_x² + n_z² =1. Hence, numerator= 1 -2n_z +1= 2(1 -n_z )

Therefore, norm squared is 2(1 -n_z ) / (n_z -1 )² = 2(1 -n_z ) / (1 -n_z )²= 2 / (1 -n_z ).

Thus, norm is sqrt(2/(1 -n_z )).

Hence, the eigenvector is:

1/sqrt(2/(1 -n_z )) * [ -n_x/(n_z -1 ), 1 ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) * [ -n_x/(n_z -1 ), 1 ]

Note that (n_z -1 )= -(1 -n_z ), so:

sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) * [ n_x/(1 -n_z ), 1 ]

= [ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

Which is what we derived earlier.

But in the previous parametrization, we had [ sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

Note that here's s difference in sign maybe depending on phase conventions. Let me see:

[ n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt((1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

But since n_x^2 =1 -n_z^2, so n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z^2 ), but actual value of n_x can be positive or negative. So if we take into account the sign of n_x.

Comparing this to the previous parametrization [ sqrt( (1 +n_z )/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

n_x = sqrt(1 - n_z^2 ), which equals sqrt( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z ) )

Hence, substituting in the first component:

n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) )= sqrt( (1 -n_z )(1 +n_z ) ) / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )) )= sqrt( (1 +n_z ) / 2 ), which matches the first component.

Therefore, [ sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 ) ]= [n_x / sqrt(2(1 -n_z )), sqrt((1 -n_z )/2 ) ]

So they’re equivalent. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [sqrt( (1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt( (1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

But to express this in terms of n_x and n_z, since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, 1 +n_z = n_z +1, and sqrt((1 +n_z )/2). But if the problem accepts the answer in trigonometric terms dependent on an angle, but since the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, but and the answer needs to be given in terms of n_x and n_z. Therefore, the elements are [sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ), sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 ) ]

There's no dependence on i or complex numbers here because the eigenvector can be chosen to be real in the x-z plane (since it's a real linear combination of σ_x and σ_z, φ=0). So the final answer is the normalized eigenvector with components sqrt((1 +n_z)/2 ) and sqrt((1 -n_z)/2 ).

Alternatively, writing them as fractions and square roots, but it's more concise to express in terms of n_z.

Hencebox:

The normalized eigenvector elements are sqrt[(1 + n_z)/2] and sqrt[(1 - n_z)/2]. Therefore,

**Final Answer**
The normalized eigenvector has elements \boxed{\sqrt{\frac{1 + n_z}{2}}} and \boxed{\sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{2}}}.
