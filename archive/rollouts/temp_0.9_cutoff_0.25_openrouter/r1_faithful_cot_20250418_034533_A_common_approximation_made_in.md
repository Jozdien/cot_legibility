# Original Question

A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons. Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this ""impulse"" approximation?

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations assumes that nucleons in a nucleus behave like free nucleons during an interaction. The assumptions that jointly imply this are:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**  
   This ensures the interaction is localized to a single nucleon, avoiding collective nuclear effects.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**  
   This prevents multiple scattering or interference from other nucleons, isolating the interaction to the target nucleon.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**  
   Neglecting binding forces allows the nucleon to be treated as free during the interaction.

**Assumption 3** (non-relativistic quarks) relates to the internal structure of the nucleon, which is not a core requirement for the impulse approximation. The approximation focuses on nuclear medium effects, not quark dynamics. Thus, the correct answer is **1, 2, 4**.

$\boxed{1, 2, 4}$

Okay, so I need to figure out which of the four assumptions lead to the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations. The impulse approximation, as I remember, is when nucleons in a nucleus are treated similarly to free nucleons during an interaction. Let me try to recall what each assumption means and how they contribute to this approximation.

First, let me review the impulse approximation. From what I learned, the impulse approximation assumes that when a particle (like a neutrino or electron) interacts with a nucleon inside a nucleus, the nucleon can be treated as if it's free. This simplifies calculations because it ignores the complex interactions between the nucleon and the rest of the nucleus during the interaction. But why is that valid?

Well, the idea is that if the interaction happens very quickly, the nucleon doesn't have time to interact with its surroundings—so the nucleus is "frozen" during the interaction. Also, maybe the effect of the nuclear medium on the nucleon is neglected, meaning the binding forces are not considered during the interaction. Hmm.

Now, looking at the four options:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

Let me break each down. 

Assumption 1: Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. That sounds basic—so the interaction isn't with the whole nucleus or mesons exchanging between nucleons, but just single nucleons. This might be part of the impulse approximation because if the current can only act on single nucleons, you model each nucleon's interaction separately. But I need to check how this plays into the approximation.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. So when the incident particle comes in, it only interacts with one nucleon and passes through the rest as if they aren't there. Like, the other nucleons don't scatter or absorb the incoming particle. This could mean that the impulse approximation ignores multiple scattering events, focusing on a single interaction. Wait, but transparency here might refer to the probe not seeing other nucleons, which would support the idea that the reaction is treated as if only one nucleon is involved, like in electron scattering where the electron only hits one nucleon.

Assumption 3: Quarks within the nucleon are non-relativistic. Not sure about this. The impulse approximation usually deals with the nuclear effects, not the internal structure of the nucleon. If the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe this simplifies the description of the nucleon's internal state, but isn't this more about the nucleon structure rather than the many-body approximation? Maybe this assumption is not part of the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation is more about the nucleus, not the internal quark dynamics. But I might need to think again.

Assumption 4: Interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. That directly relates to treating the nucleon as free. If binding forces are ignored during the interaction, then the nucleon's behavior is similar to a free one, which is exactly the impulse approximation. So 4 seems essential. 

Putting it together:

The impulse approximation requires that the interaction with the nucleon is as if it's free. So, the key points are ignoring the binding forces (4) and considering single-nucleon interactions (1 and 2). The transparency (2) would mean that other nucleons don't affect the interaction, so the probe doesn't get scattered by others. Assumption 1 would be necessary because if the current interacted with multiple nucleons collectively, you couldn't treat them as individual free particles. 

Transparency (2) and single-nucleon interaction (1) both contribute to the idea that the probe interacts with one nucleon at a time without disturbance from others. If the nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon, then there's no multiple scattering or medium effects. Assumption 4 removes the binding forces, effectively making the nucleon free during the interaction. That would leave 1, 2, and 4. But wait, question says "which of the four assumptions jointly imply"—so they have to select multiple.

However, the options are given as four, and the answer requires selecting which ones are required. The possible combinations are 1,2,4. But the original question gives four choices, so perhaps 1,2,3,4? But why would assumption 3 be involved?

Wait, maybe not. The question is tricky. Let's go back. The impulse approximation usually assumes that the interaction with the nucleon is sudden and that the nucleon is off-shell but approximated as free. It depends on the physics of the process.

Possible standard impulse approximation conditions:

- The struck nucleon is treated as free (so 4 is needed)
- The interactions are with single nucleons (1)
- The effect of the nuclear medium (other nucleons) doesn't modify the interaction (maybe 2, but maybe others)
- Relativistic effects inside the nucleon are negligible.

Wait, but assumption 3 is about quarks being non-relativistic. For the nucleon structure, if the quarks are non-relativistic, then the nucleon form factors might be simpler, but is that necessary for the impulse approximation? Or is that part of the approximation of treating the nucleon as a point particle?

I might need to recall whether the impulse approximation necessarily requires that the internal structure of the nucleon is non-relativistic. The impulse approximation is more about the nucleus's effect on the nucleon, not the nucleon's internal structure. So even if the quarks are relativistic, as long as the overall nucleon is moving non-relativistically in the nucleus, maybe? 

But assumption 4 is about no binding forces, which would take care of the nucleus's effect. So perhaps 3 is not required.

Alternatively, maybe 3 is necessary so that the internal motion of the quarks doesn't cause complications, but that seems separate. If the quarks are non-relativistic, the nucleon can be treated as a static object, which might be part of assuming it's free. This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe when the impulse approximation is applied in certain contexts like deep inelastic scattering, it's combined with other approximations like the non-relativistic quark model. But usually, the impulse approximation in nuclear physics refers to treating the nucleon as free despite being in a nucleus, regardless of its internal structure. So maybe 3 is not necessary.

So, putting all together, which ones are correct: 1, 2, 4.

But perhaps 3 also is considered. I need to verify.

Wait, I think in the impulse approximation, sometimes it's also assumed that the interaction is with a single nucleon (1), other nucleons don't participate (2), and binding effects are neglected (4). So 1, 2, 4. But the answer options are 1,2,3,4; but only four options given. The question lists four options; the answer is "which of the four" jointly imply. So select those three.

But the original problem gives four options. The user lists the options as 1 to 4, and we need to choose which ones. So the answer must be a combination of 1,2,4? Let me search for impulse approximation conditions.

Upon checking some notes... The impulse approximation typically involves the assumption that:

- The interaction is with a single nucleon (1),
- The interaction is sudden, so the nucleus does not have time to respond (related to transparency, maybe 2),
- The nucleon is off-shell, but approximated as free (4).

The assumption about the quarks (3) being non-relativistic may relate to whether the nucleon structure can be treated non-relativistically. For example, if you model the nucleon as non-relativistic, the internal quark dynamics may not affect the interaction as much. But maybe for the impulse approximation, that's a different assumption. For example, in electron scattering, the relativistic motion of quarks inside the nucleon is considered in deep inelastic scattering, but in the impulse approximation, you might ignore the internal quark structure and treat the nucleon as a point particle. However, if assumption 3 states that the quarks are non-relativistic, that could be part of treating the nucleon as a simple particle (like in a non-relativistic quark model) rather than accounting for relativistic quarks. But is this part of the impulse approximation?

Alternatively, maybe the impulse approximation doesn't require assumption 3. If the impulse approximation is that the nuclear effects are ignored (treating nucleons as free), and the other assumptions about single-particle interaction, then 1, 2, 4 are needed. If that's the case, then the correct options are 1, 2, 4. But the options don't include a combination of three. Wait, the original question just lists four points and asks which four assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. It says "which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this 'impulse' approximation?" So we have four assumptions listed, and the one or more that jointly imply the approximation. But the user says "Which of the following four", so the answer is some subset of the four. 

Wait, according to nuclear physics references, the impulse approximation typically assumes that:

1) The projectile interacts with only one nucleon (the single scattering assumption). So that's 1 and perhaps 2 (nucleus transparent).

2) The interaction with the nucleon is the same as if it were free (so 4 is needed: no binding forces).

So the key assumptions here are 1, 2, and 4. Assumption 3, regarding non-relativistic quarks, would be separate. 

Therefore, the answer is assumptions 1,2,4. But since it's a multiple-choice question and each is labeled 1 to 4, but we have to choose which four options are correct? Wait, the options are statements 1 to 4. So which of the four statements are correct. So maybe the correct answer is statements 1,2,4. So in some contexts, these are the three, but perhaps some sources might include assumption 3. It's unclear.

Alternatively, the transparency (2) may not be necessary, but this depends. Wait, if the nucleus is transparent, that makes sure that other nucleons don't interfere; but maybe just ignoring the binding potential (4) is enough. Hmm. 

Alternatively, "impulse approximation" is also called the "single scattering approximation," which would require 1 (only single nucleon interactions) and 2 (transparency) because if the nucleus is transparent, you don't have multiple interactions. But perhaps not, because transparency might be a separate effect. Alternatively, maybe you just have to assume that the current only acts on single nucleons and that their binding is negligible, which would be 1 and 4.

But I need to resolve this.

Let me check another angle. For example, in the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA) in electron scattering, the assumptions are:

- The electron interacts with a single nucleon.
- The nucleon is knocked out without further interactions (nuclear transparency).
- The struck nucleon is treated as free (no initial binding potential considered).

So assuming 1, 2, and 4. Then 3 is about quark structure.

Therefore, the answer should be 1,2,4. Quark being non-relativistic (3) is not directly part of this. For example, even if quarks are relativistic internally (as they are in reality), the impulse approximation can still be applied. So 3 is not required. 

Thus, the correct premises are 1, 2, and 4. But since the question gives four options, perhaps only three are required. So the answer is statements 1,2,4.

But the user has presented four options as 1-4. The way the question is asked is to select all that apply. Since the options are presented as four separate claims, but the correct answer is 1,2,4, the answer is these three. The format here may require just listing the numbers separated by commas.

But given that, I think the correct answer is that assumptions 1, 2, 4 jointly imply the impulse approximation.

# Anthropic completion

Alright, I need to determine which assumptions contribute to the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations. The impulse approximation treats nucleons within a nucleus as essentially free during interactions.

When reviewing the impulse approximation, I understand it assumes that during particle-nucleon interactions within a nucleus, the nucleon behaves as if it were free. This simplifies calculations by disregarding the complex interactions between that nucleon and the rest of the nucleus. This approximation works when interactions occur rapidly, leaving no time for the nucleon to interact with surrounding nucleons—effectively "freezing" the nucleus during the interaction. It also typically neglects the effects of nuclear binding forces.

Examining the four possible assumptions:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
   This seems fundamental—the interaction occurs with single nucleons rather than the entire nucleus or meson exchanges between nucleons. If interactions only target individual nucleons, we can model each nucleon's interaction separately. I need to determine if this supports the impulse approximation.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
   This suggests the incident particle interacts exclusively with one nucleon while passing through the others unaffected. This assumption eliminates multiple scattering events, focusing on single interactions. It supports treating the reaction as if only one nucleon is involved, similar to electron scattering where an electron strikes just one nucleon.

3. Quarks within the nucleon are non-relativistic.
   I'm uncertain about this one. The impulse approximation typically addresses nuclear effects, not nucleon internal structure. Non-relativistic quarks might simplify the nucleon's internal state description, but this seems more related to nucleon structure than many-body approximations. This assumption may not be central to the impulse approximation, which primarily concerns nuclear rather than quark dynamics.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
   This directly relates to treating nucleons as free particles during interactions, ignoring the effects of binding forces from surrounding nucleons. This seems to be at the heart of the impulse approximation.

I need to determine which of the four assumptions contribute to the impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations. The impulse approximation assumes nucleons in a nucleus behave similarly to free nucleons during an interaction. Let me delve into what each assumption implies and how they relate to this approximation.

First, let's review the impulse approximation. As I recall, it assumes that when a particle (like a neutrino or electron) interacts with a nucleon inside a nucleus, the nucleon is treated as if it's free. This simplifies calculations by ignoring the complex interactions between the nucleon and the nucleus during the interaction. But why is this approach valid?

The idea is that if the interaction occurs rapidly, the nucleon doesn’t have time to engage with its environment—effectively "freezing" the nucleus during the interaction. Additionally, this might mean the nuclear medium's influence on the nucleon is ignored, discounting the binding forces during the interaction.

Now, considering the four assumptions:

1. The interaction current only affects individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus appears transparent except for the selected nucleon.
3. The nucleon's internal quarks are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction occurs as if the selected nucleon feels no binding forces.

Breaking each down:

Assumption 1 posits that the interaction current only affects individual nucleons. This suggests interactions aren't with the whole nucleus or mesons between nucleons, but solely with single nucleons. This could be part of the impulse approximation since if the current targets individual nucleons, each nucleon’s interaction is modeled separately. I need to see how this integrates with the premise.

Assumption 2 suggests the nucleus is transparent save for the selected nucleon. The incoming particle interacts with one nucleon and passes through the rest as if they aren’t there—other nucleons don't scatter or absorb it. This could mean that the impulse approximation ignores multiple scattering events, emphasizing a single interaction. Transparency might imply the probe doesn’t detect other nucleons, supporting the idea of a reaction as if only one nucleon is involved—like in electron scattering when an electron only collides with one nucleon.

Assumption 3 assumes quarks within the nucleon are non-relativistic. I'm unsure about this one. The impulse approximation typically deals with nuclear effects rather than the nucleon's internal structure. If quarks are non-relativistic, this might simplify the nucleon’s internal state description, but this seems more about nucleon structure than the many-body approximation. The impulse approximation concerns the nucleus, not internal quark dynamics. I may need to reflect further on this.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations assumes that nucleons in a nucleus behave as free nucleons during an interaction. To determine which assumptions imply this approximation, we analyze the given options:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**  
   This means the interaction is with single nucleons rather than the nucleus as a whole, ignoring many-body effects beyond single nucleon interactions.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**  
   This implies that the incident particle interacts with only one nucleon and does not scatter off or get absorbed by other nucleons, supporting the idea of a single interaction event.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**  
   This pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon rather than the nuclear environment, which is not relevant to the impulse approximation.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**  
   This is crucial as it assumes the nucleon's response is similar to a free nucleon, ignoring the effects of nuclear binding during the interaction.

Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are essential for the impulse approximation, focusing on single nucleon interactions, transparency of the nucleus, and neglecting binding forces. Assumption 3 is unrelated to the nuclear many-body effects addressed by the impulse approximation.

nostically.

Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. That is, during the interaction, the nucleon is free. This seems central to the impulse approximation. Because if the nucleon is bound in the nucleus, its wavefunction is different from a free one. But if we neglect binding forces during the interaction, then the nucleon's response is similar to free. This is also related to the idea that the interaction is sudden—so the nucleon doesn't have time to readjust due to binding.

Now, which of these four are required for the impulse approximation. The name "impulse" suggests a short-duration interaction, so maybe the process is so fast that other nucleons don't have time to react (hence, transparency in assumption 2). Also, the interaction being with individual nucleons (1) and no binding forces during the interaction (4) makes sense. However, assumption 3 about quarks being non-relativistic—if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe the nucleon structure is simplified, but I'm not sure. For example, in electron scattering, even if the nucleon is treated as free, the form factors still account for internal quark structure, but if they are non-relativistic, then perhaps the form factors are simplified. However, the impulse approximation is more about the nuclear environment rather than the internal nucleon structure.

Typically, the impulse approximation ignores the medium effects on the nucleon during the interaction, assuming the nucleon is free. Therefore, assumptions 1, 2, and 4 might contribute. Let's check each again.

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So the current doesn't couple to the nucleus as a whole or to meson-exchange currents. Yes, that's part of ignoring many-body effects beyond single nucleon interactions.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. So the probe doesn't interact with other nucleons, no multiple scattering. This also would support the impulse approximation as a single scattering event.

4. No binding forces during interaction. So the nucleon is considered free during the interaction. That is essential because the binding would modify the nucleon's response.

Assumption 3. Quarks are non-relativistic. If the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe this is a separate approximation related to the structure of the nucleon, not the many-body aspect. For example, non-relativistic quark models vs. relativistic ones. But the impulse approximation is about treating the nucleon as free in the nuclear medium, not about the internal quark kinematics. So perhaps 3 is not required. Then, maybe the correct assumptions are 1, 2, and 4. But let me check.

Alternatively, sometimes the impulse approximation is also called the "single particle" approximation, where each nucleon is treated as moving independently in a mean field. But in interactions, like electron scattering, the impulse approximation would involve that the electron interacts with a nucleon as if it's free, which would require that the nuclear medium doesn't modify the interaction (like screening, or other effects). That would be akin to 4. But might 2 and 1 be necessary?

Suppose we think of electron scattering: the electron interacts with a single nucleon (1), and the nucleus is transparent (2), meaning that the electron doesn't get scattered by other nucleons. Then the interaction is local to the one nucleon, and the nucleon is treated as free (4). If 3 is irrelevant, then maybe the correct answer is 1, 2, 4. Are all three required? Maybe all four? Wait, maybe 3 is not. Let me check some references if possible (although I can't access them now). For example, I remember that in the impulse approximation for electron scattering, you assume that the electron interacts with a single nucleon (1), that the other nucleons do not affect the interaction (so nucleus is transparent, 2), and the nucleon is off-shell but treated as free (4). Assumption 3, regarding quark motion, would be more about the structure functions of the nucleon. So perhaps assumption 3 is not part of the impulse approximation. So maybe options 1,2,4. But the question says "which of the four assumptions jointly imply"—so possibly 1,2,4. But need to check the statements again.

But wait, the general idea of impulse approximation is that the interaction is with a single nucleon as if it were free, requiring that the nuclear effects (binding) don't modify the interaction. So assumptions 1 (only individual nucleons), 2 (transparency so only one nucleon is involved), and 4 (no binding forces during interaction) all contribute. Assumption 3 relates to the internal structure, which might not be part of the impulse approximation.

Therefore, the answer should be 1,2,4. Since the question lists four options and asks which jointly imply the approximation. Let me check the options again:

The options are 1,2,3,4. The answer would be options 1, 2, 4.

But some sources might say that assumption 3 is part of the non-relativistic quark model but perhaps not necessary for the impulse approximation. Alternatively, if the quarks are relativistic, their confinement might require a different treatment, but if they are non-relativistic, the nucleon structure can be considered as simple, which the impulse approximation might require? But I'm not sure. The impulse approximation is more about the nuclear medium, not the quark structure. So I think 3 is not required. Therefore, 1, 2, and 4 are the relevant assumptions.

Furthermore, words of the impulse approximation: it assumes that the struck nucleon is off-shell but the interaction vertex is the same as for a free nucleon. This requires that the interaction is with individual nucleons (1), that others are transparent (2), and that the nucleon's binding is neglected during the interaction (4). So indeed, 1, 2, 4. So the answer is these three. But how the options are to be selected? The question says "which of the four assumptions jointly imply this 'impulse' approximation?" The possible answers are combinations of these. The user hasn't given options A to D, but the original problem lists 1 to 4. Probably selecting 1,2,4. However, let me just check again.

Sometimes, another aspect in the impulse approximation is the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) in scattering, which assumes the ejected nucleon doesn't rescatter (hence nucleus is transparent, 2), interaction is with a single nucleon (1), and binding effects are neglected (4). So those three. Assumption 3 is about quarks in the nucleon, which is a separate assumption. Thus, 1,2,4 are the correct. So the answer is options 1,2,4.

**Final Answer**
The assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are \boxed{1}, \boxed{2}, and \boxed{4}.

The impulse approximation in nuclear physics assumes that nucleons within a nucleus behave as free particles during an interaction. The assumptions that jointly imply this approximation are:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This ensures the interaction targets single nucleons, bypassing nucleus-wide effects or meson exchanges.  
2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This eliminates multiple scattering or medium effects, restricting the interaction to one nucleon.  
4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: Ignoring nuclear binding forces allows the nucleon's behavior to resemble that of a free particle.  

**Assumption 3** (quarks are non-relativistic) is not critical here, as the impulse approximation focuses on nuclear dynamics rather than the internal relativistic quark structure of nucleons. 

**Answer:** Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 jointly imply the impulse approximation.  
**Correct choices:** 1, 2, 4.

If binding forces are neglected, the nucleon's response mirrors that of a free nucleon.

Putting it together:
- Assumption 1 and 2 ensure the interaction is only with a single nucleon without disturbances from others (transparent nucleus), allowing each nucleon to be considered individually. 
- Assumption 4 explicitly removes binding forces so the nucleon behaves freely. 
- Assumption 3 involves quark behavior, which isn't directly relevant here unless relativistic effects in the nucleon's internal structure alter their interaction. However, impulse approximation is more about nuclear medium effects.

The impulse approximation in many-body nuclear calculations relies on treating nucleons as if they are free during an interaction. The key assumptions that jointly imply this approximation are:

   The interaction is assumed to occur with a single nucleon rather than the nucleus as a whole. This focuses the calculation on the nucleon level, neglecting collective nuclear effects or exchange currents.

   The probe (e.g., an electron or neutrino) interacts only with the selected nucleon, and the rest of the nucleus does not obstruct or modify the interaction. This ensures no multiple scattering or distortion from other nucleons, simplifying the process.

Assumption 4 states the interaction proceeds as if the nucleon has no binding forces, meaning its motion isn’t affected by the nuclear potential during the interaction. This directly addresses the approximation's assumption that binding forces are neglected. The nucleon’s properties (like momentum) would be as if free, simplifying calculations. This seems central to the impulse approximation.

Reviewing, which of these combine to allow us to model the nucleon as free? Assumption 1 ensures the interaction is with individual nucleons. Assumption 2 implies other nucleons don’t interfere—so no distortions due to the probe passing through other particles. Assumption 4 removes binding forces, meaning the nucleon behaves freely. Assumption 3, about quarks being non-relativistic, might relate to wavefunction modeling within the nucleon. But how relevant is that to the impulse approximation?

If the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps the nucleon's internal structure can be treated more simply, but does this influence the nuclear many-body effect? The impulse approximation generally doesn’t delve into quark-level details; it's more about nuclear effects. Unless in the context of, say, deep inelastic scattering where quark distributions matter, but the quark non-relativistic assumption might actually contradict reality (since quarks in nucleons are relativistic). But if it's part of the assumptions for a particular model, maybe under the impulse approximation one assumes even at quark level they can be treated non-relativistically. However, this seems distinct from the nuclear aspects.

Focusing on the main points, the key conditions for impulse approximation are: single-nucleon interaction (1), no final-state interactions (nuclear transparency, 2), and no binding forces during the interaction (4). So 1, 2, and 4. But the question is, which "jointly imply" the approximation. The third assumption about non-relativistic quarks may not be necessary. Let me check standard explanations.

From my notes: The impulse approximation typically involves two key assumptions. First, the interaction is with a single nucleon (like plane wave impulse approximation). Second, the struck nucleon is treated as free, neglecting initial state interactions and final-state interactions. This requires that the interaction happens so quickly that the nucleon doesn't feel the nuclear potential during the interaction (Fermi motion might still be considered via momentum distribution). Also, transparency (no multiple scattering), so the projectile doesn't interact with other nucleons. That points to assumptions 1, 2, and 4.

Non-relativistic quarks (3) might pertain to how the cross-section for the nucleon is calculated. If the quarks move non-relativistically, perhaps the nucleon's form factor is simpler, but this is more about calculating the free nucleon response rather than the approximation in the nuclear context. Since the question is about which assumptions allow treating nucleons as free (ignoring nuclear medium effects during the interaction), 1, 2, and 4 are critical. But let's verify:

Suppose assumption 1 is missing. Then interaction may involve pairs of nucleons or exchange currents, which the impulse approximation ignores. Therefore, 1 is essential. If the nucleus isn't transparent, multiple interactions or distortions would occur, so 2 matters. If binding forces are not neglected (4 missing), then the nucleon's state would be different from free. Thus, 4 is key.

Assumption 3 is perhaps a red herring. However, some sources might include that in impulse approximation. Wait, in electron scattering, the impulse approximation can involve using free nucleon form factors. If one makes a non-relativistic quark model for the nucleon form factor (assumption 3), that's a separate assumption. But does that form part of the impulse approximation, or is it an additional assumption? The problem states "jointly imply this impulse approximation," so the answer is likely that (3) isn't necessary, but (1), (2), and (4) are.

But some references might have different combinations. For example, maybe (1) and (4)? Or (1), 2, 4? Let's see. From Wikipedia or textbooks: "Impulse approximation assumes that the duration of the collision is short enough that the target does not move appreciably during the collision, so that the potential energy (or cross-section etc.) can be approximated by its value at the initial position." For nuclear physics, this would mean the binding potential is not effective during the collision. This is similar to assumption 4. Also, the projectile interacts with individual nucleons (1). The transparency (2) might be considered if the effect of the rest of the nucleus is neglected, but sometimes IA is just the combination of the interaction being with a single nucleon and treating that nucleon as free. However, multiple scattering would need to be excluded (so transparency assumption 2). 

Alternatively, assumption 2 (nucleus transparent) may relate to the "optical" model's transparency, but impulse approximation primarily refers to treatment of the struck nucleon as free. So maybe the combination is 1, 2, and 4. Or 1 and 4. Hmm.

Another resource: In quantum mechanics, the impulse approximation applies when the interaction is sudden and the state of the system doesn't change during the interaction.

But in some contexts, especially in electron scattering, the impulse approximation is valid when the momentum transfer is high enough that the interaction is with a single nucleon (so 1 and 2), and the nucleon's binding is negligible (4). So indeed, 1, 2, and 4.

That leaves assumption 3 as not necessary. Therefore, the answer is options 1, 2, and 4.
