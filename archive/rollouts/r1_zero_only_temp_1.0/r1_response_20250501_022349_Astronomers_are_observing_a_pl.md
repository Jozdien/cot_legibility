# Original Question

Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. What is the maximum orbital period of a second planet, with a radius of 2.5 times that of Earth, in the same system that will exhibit both transit and occultation events? Assume that the second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane as the previously mentioned transiting planet.

To solve for the maximum orbital period of a second planet that exhibits both transit and occultation events, we need to first recall what "transit" and "occultation" mean in the context of exoplanets.

1. **Transit**: This occurs when a planet passes directly in front of its star from our line of sight, causing a dip in the star's brightness as the planet blocks a part of the star's light.
2. **Occultation (also known as secondary eclipse)**: This occurs when a planet passes directly behind its star from our line of sight, causing a dip in the total brightness because the light from both the star and the planet (which reflects some of the star's light) is now just the light from the star alone (since the planet is hidden behind the star).

For a planet to undergo both transit and occultation events, it needs to be on an orbit that brings it both in front of ("transit") and directly behind ("occultation") its star from our observational point of view. This implies that the planet's orbital plane must be nearly edge-on from our line of sight such that both events can occur. 

#### Defined Variables and Given Information:

- First planet has a radius $R_p = R_\oplus$ (where $R_\oplus$ is the Earth's radius).
- Transit impact parameter $b$ is given as $b = 0.2$ for the first planet.
- The star has a radius $R_s = 1.5\,R_{\odot}$ (where $R_{\odot}$ is the Sun's radius).
- The first planet has an orbital period $P_1 = 3$ days.

#### Objective:
We need to find the maximum orbital period $P_2$ for a second planet with a radius $R_{p2} = 2.5\,R_\oplus$ that exhibits both transit and occultation events while sharing the same orbital plane as the first planet.

#### Using Kepler's Third Law:
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period $P$ is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis $a$ of the orbit:
$$
P^2 \propto a^3 \Rightarrow \frac{P_1^2}{a_1^3} = \frac{P_2^2}{a_2^3}.
$$
Since both planets orbit the same star, the proportionality constant is the same for both planets. Thus, $P_1^2 / a_1^3 = P_2^2 / a_2^3$, so:
$$
P_2 = P_1\left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}.
$$
To find $P_2$, we need to solve for $a_2$.

#### Condition for Transit and Occultation:
For transit and occultation events to occur for the second planet, its orbit must be such that the geometric configuration aligns such that the planet passes both in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star from our line of sight. It means that the second planet's orbit must still be "nearly edge-on" as seen from Earth such that our line of sight must lie within the orbital plane (within a small angle such that both transit and occultation are visible).

To find such a "nearly edge-on" orbit, the line of sight should make a very small angle with the orbital plane such that the line of sight intersects both the planet's orbit on both sides of the star. An important parameter here is the "inclination angle" $i$, which should be close to $90^\circ$ (with inclination defined such that $i=90^\circ$ corresponds to an orbit seen edge-on).

Another useful term here is the "impact parameter" $b$, defined as the projected distance from the center of the star to the center of the planet's disk during mid-transit in units of the star's radius $R_s$:
$$
b = \frac{a}{R_s} \cos(i).
$$
Here, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit and $i$ is the inclination angle where $i=90^\circ$ signifies a perfectly edge-on transit where $b=0$.

#### Given $b$ for the first planet:
$$
b = \frac{a_1 \cos(i)}{R_s} = 0.2,
$$
where $a_1$ is the semi-major axis of the first planet's orbit such that:
$$
a_1 \cos(i) = 0.2 \times R_s.
$$
This equation indicates that the first planet has an impact parameter of $0.2$, which means it does not pass through the center of the star's disk but at a distance of $0.2 R_s$ from the center of the star during mid-transit. 

#### Finding $a_1$:
The question mentions that the second planet shares the same orbital plane as the first planet, thus the inclination angle $i$ should be the same for both planets. So, $b_1$ (impact parameter for the first planet) is:
$$
b_1 = \frac{a_1 \cos(i)}{R_s} = 0.2,
$$
hence,
$$
\cos(i) = \frac{0.2 \times R_s}{a_1}.
$$

Similarly, for the second planet:
$$
b_2 = \frac{a_2 \cos(i)}{R_s}.
$$
To find the specific $b_2$, we need $a_2$ such that the second planet exhibits both transit and occultation events. For such events to happen simultaneously, the second planet must pass both in front of and behind the star such that:
$$
b_2 < 1 + \frac{R_{p2}}{R_s}.
$$

However, if $b_2 > 1$, the planet might not fully transit the star (i.e., graze the edge), so typically $b_2 \leq 1$ guarantees that a full transit or at least a partial transit occurs. Yet another check required for a full transit can be noted as:
$$
b_2 + \frac{R_{p2}}{R_s} \leq 1,
$$
However, "transit" here refers broadly to any transit event regardless of whether it's a full or partial transit for now concerning transit and occultation conditions. 

However, a more well-known requirement for a transit to occur is:
$$
b \leq \frac{R_s + R_p}{R_s} = 1 + \frac{R_p}{R_s}.
$$
However, a more conservative "total" transit (transit might still happen if $b < 1 + \frac{R_p}{R_s}$, but $b < 1 - \frac{R_p}{R_s}$ makes a "central transit" more likely).  

Similarly, for an occultation (secondary eclipse) to occur, the planet must pass behind the star such that $b \leq \frac{R_s + R_p}{R_s}$. Generally, the same condition $b \leq 1 + \frac{R_p}{R_s}$ should hold true for occultation events if the second planet has a non-negligible angular size compared to the star (since "transit" and "occultation" events require that the planet comes approximately in line with the star from our viewpoint). 

However, a more stringent demand might be made such that $b < 1$. Hence, an appropriate condition seems to be $b_2 < 1 + \frac{R_{p2}}{R_s}$, but a more stringent $b_2 < 1$ might make sure that the planet indeed aligns well enough for us to detect.

However, the main limiting factor here is $b_2 < 1$. To make sure both occultation and transit occur, $b_2$ should be less than or equal to $1 - \frac{R_{p2}}{R_s}$. To make it a maximum case, any $b_2$ such that:
$$
b_2 = \frac{a_2 \cos(i)}{R_s} \leq 1.
$$
This ensures that the center of the planet passes within one stellar radius from the center of the star (which implies transit if $a_2 \cos(i) \leq R_s - R_{p2}$).

Moreover, as per the condition for occultation:
$$
b_2 \leq 1,
$$
since if the projected distance $b_2$ is larger than $1$, the planet does not pass directly behind the star from our line of sight.

Therefore, the "edge case" for $b_2$ should be:
$$
b_2 = \frac{a_2 \cos(i)}{R_s} \leq 1,
$$
where $b_2 = \frac{a_2 \cos(i)}{R_s}$. 

Since both planets share the same orbital plane, the same $\cos(i)$ applies:
$$
\cos(i) = \frac{0.2 R_s}{a_1}.
$$
However, what we need here is an equation for such that $b_2 \leq 1$:
$$
b_2 = \frac{a_2 \cos(i)}{R_s} \leq 1.
$$
Substituting $cos(i)$ from the first planet's impact parameter $b_1 = 0.2$:
$$
b_2 = \frac{a_2 \times \frac{0.2 R_s}{a_1}}{R_s} \leq 1.
$$
Hence,
$$
b_2 = \frac{0.2 a_2}{a_1} \leq 1.
$$
Solving for $a_2$:
$$
a_2 \leq \frac{a_1}{0.2} = 5a_1.
$$

#### To find the semi-major axis $a_1$ for the first planet:
Kepler's third law relates the orbital period $P$ to the semi-major axis $a$ explicitly as follows:
$$
P_1^2 = \left(\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}\right)a_1^3,
$$
where $M$ is the mass of the star. Similarly for the second planet,
$$
P_2^2 = \left(\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}\right)a_2^3,
$$
which makes,
$$
\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^2 =\left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^3.
$$
$$
P_2 = P_1 \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}.
$$
Based on our reasoning,
$$
a_2 \leq 5 a_1.
$$
Thus, the maximum $a_2$ such that the second planet also transits and is occulted is $a_2 = 5 a_1$.

Given that $P_1 = 3$ days, we need to find $P_2$:
$$
P_2 = 3 \left(\frac{5 a_1}{a_1}\right)^{3/2} = 3 \times 5^{3/2} = 3 \times 5\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \times 5 \times 2.236 = 3 \times 11.1803 \approx 33.54.
$$

Let us round $5^{3/2}$ accurately:
$$
= 3 \times 5\sqrt{5} = 3 \times \sqrt{125} \approx 3 \times 11.18 = 33.54.
$$

So, rounding to a few significant figures for $5\sqrt{5}$ yields:
$$
5\sqrt{5} \approx 11.1803 \text{ (keeping more digits, so } 5\sqrt{5} \text{ is approximately } 11.1803).
$$
Thus,
$$
P_2 = 3 \times 5^{3/2} \approx 33.5409 \text{ (days)}.
$$
However, rounding makes us round up $5\sqrt{5}$ correctly as $11.18 \times 3 = 33.54$ days for the round answer.

However, what might need a bit of extra verification is that $b_1 = 0.2$ means:
$$
b_1 = \frac{a_1 \cos(i)}{1.5 R_{\odot}} = 0.2,
$$
hence:
$$
\cos(i) = \frac{0.2 \times 1.5 R_{\odot}}{a_1} = \frac{0.3 R_{\odot}}{a_1}.
$$
And for the second planet:
$$
b_2 = \frac{a_2 \cos(i)}{1.5 R_{\odot}} = \frac{a_2 \times \frac{0.3 R_{\odot}}{a_1}}{1.5 R_{\odot}} = \frac{a_2 \times 0.3}{1.5 a_1} = \frac{0.2 a_2}{a_1}.
$$
Thus, to satisfy $b_2 \leq 1 + \frac{R_{p2}}{R_s}$ where $R_{p2} = 2.5 R_{\oplus}$ and $R_s = 1.5 R_{\odot}$:
$$
\frac{0.2 a_2}{a_1} \leq 1 + \frac{2.5 R_{\oplus}}{1.5 R_{\odot}}.
$$
But as defined:
$$
\frac{0.2 a_2}{a_1} \leq 1.
$$
However, making a more precise check:
Use $R_{\odot} \approx 6.957 \times 10^8$ meters and $R_{\oplus} \approx 6.371 \times 10^6$ meters such that:
$$
\frac{2.5 R_{\oplus}}{1.5 R_{\odot}} \rightarrow \frac{2.5 \times 6.371 \times 10^6}{1.5 \times 6.957 \times 10^8} \approx \frac{2.5 \times 6.371}{1.5 \times 695.7} \approx \frac{15.9275}{1043.55} \approx 0.0153.
$$
Since $1 + 0.0153 \approx 1.0153$, $b_2 \leq 1.0153$ makes a marginal difference compared to $b_2 \leq 1$, thus in order for both transit and occultation events to occur:
$$
\frac{0.2\,a_2}{a_1} \leq 1,
$$
is a sufficient approximation where $b_2 \leq 1$ seems like a valid condition here. Another check might indeed be $b_2 \leq 1.0153$, but such a small increase from $1$ makes a marginal difference here except for making the inequality a bit stricter:
$$
a_2 \leq \frac{1.5 \, a_1}{0.3} = \frac{a_1}{0.2} = 5 a_1.
$$
And again:
$$
P_2 = P_1 \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{3\over2} = 3 \times (5)^{3/2} \approx 3 \times 11.18 = 33.54,
$$
seems to be a sound answer.

Therefore based on the mentioned calculations, the maximum orbital period for a second planet of radius $2.5\, R_{\oplus}$ which exhibits both transit and occultation events would be approximately $33.54$ days. However, a more intuitive check might be:
$$
\sqrt{125} = 5^{7/2} \simeq 11.18,
$$
thus:
$$
P_2 = 3\sqrt{125} \simeq 33.5410.\text{ (days)}
$$

However, a more "safe" check should make us verify our final expression $P_2 = P_1 \times 5^{3/2} \approx 33.5$ days seems reasonable. Any $a_2 > 5 a_1$ would make $b_2 > 1$, making simultaneous transit and occultation unlikely.

Thus one valid rounded answer would be:
$$
3 \times 5^{3/2} \text{ days}.
$$
The actual square root of $5$ is approximately $2.236$, so $5^{3/2} \approx 11.18$, so:
$$
P_2 \approx 3 \times 11.18 = 33.54 \simeq 33.5 \, \text{days}.
$$

Alternatively, if you need an exact expression for the reasoning:
$$
\boxed{3 \times 5^{3/2}} \text{ days} \text{ (which simplifies to roughly $3 \times 11.18 = 33.54$ days)}
$$
which makes $33.54$ days a valid rational rounded answer.
