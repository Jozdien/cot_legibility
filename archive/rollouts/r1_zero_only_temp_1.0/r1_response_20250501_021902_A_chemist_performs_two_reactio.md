# Original Question

A chemist performs two reactions:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. 

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with one equiv. of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid.

Both reactions go to 100% completion. The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.

Assuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?

To analyze what happens with reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene when treated with one equivalent of mCPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid), followed by aqueous acid, let us break down the reactions individually.

### Step-by-step reasoning for Reaction 1 ((E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid):

1. **Reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA**:
    
    The first part of both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 is the reaction of an alkene (either(E)-oct-4-ene or (Z)-oct-4-ene) with mCPBA. This reaction is typically known as an epoxidation reaction where mCPBA acts as an oxidizing agent that converts alkenes into epoxides (oxiranes).

    The structure of (E)-oct-4-ene can be depicted as:
    
    CH$_3$CH$_2$CH$_2$CH=CHCH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_3$, where the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5 (numbering from left to right where the first carbon is part of the ethyl group attached to the double bond).
    
    The E configuration indicates that the two larger alkyl groups (propyl groups in this case, since CH3CH2CH2 is considered on one portion and CH2CH2CH3 is on the other) are on opposite sides of the double bond:
    
$$
\underset{(CH_3CH_2CH_2)}{\overset{H}{\underset{\large\vert}{\mathrm{\textbf{C}}}}}\underset{\large\parallel}{\textbf{=}}\underset{(CH_2CH_2CH_3)}{\overset{H}{\underset{\large\vert}{\mathrm{\textbf{C}}}}}
$$
    
    Another way to visualize (E)-oct-4-ene is specifically:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2} \underset{(1)}{\mathrm{C}} \underset{(2)}{\mathrm{H}} \\
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \underset{\text{(E)}}{=} \\
\mathrm{CH_2CH_2CH_3} \underset{(1)}{\mathrm{C}} \underset{(2)}{\mathrm{H}}
$$
    
    Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene has the double bond between carbons 4 and 5 as well, but the two larger alkyl groups are on the same side of the double bond:
$$
\underset{(CH_3CH_2CH_2)}{\overset{H}{\underset{\large\vert}{\mathrm{\textbf{C}}}}}\underset{\large\parallel}{\textbf{=}}\underset{H}{\overset{(CH_2CH_2CH_3)}{\underset{\large\vert}{\mathrm{\textbf{C}}}}}
$$
    
    Another way to visualize (Z)-oct-4-ene is:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2} \underset{(1)}{\mathrm{C}} \underset{(2)}{\mathrm{H}} \\
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \underset{\text{(Z)}}{=} \\
\mathrm{H} \underset{(1)}{\mathrm{C}} \underset{(2)}{\mathrm{CH_2CH_2CH_3}}
$$

#### Intermediate Epoxide Formation:

When treated with mCPBA, (E)-oct-4-ene is converted into an epoxide specific that preserves the stereochemistry of the alkene (syn-addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond); thus, the relative stereochemistry of the substituents (i.e., the propyl groups on the epoxide) is "trans" (which corresponds to the "trans" or "transoid" configuration from the original "E" stereochemistry of the double bond).

$$
\mathrm{(E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA} \longrightarrow \text{(4\textbf{R},5\textbf{S})-4-propyl-5-ethyl oxirane}
$$
This epoxide from Reaction 1 can be denoted as the following where the "trans" part refers to the relative positions of the propyl groups originally on opposite sides of the double bond forming a "trans" epoxide where two chiral centers are generated such that the configuration is (4R,5S)-4-propyl-5-ethyl oxirane. Another valid name might be (4R,5S)-4,5-diethyloxirane where one group is a propyl and another is an ethyl group attached stereospecifically.

2. **Treatment of Epoxide with Aqueous Acid**:

    Upon treatment with water under acidic conditions (aqueous acid), epoxides can be hydrolyzed to form diols. For a generic epoxide, the reaction is typically an anti addition of water where the epoxide is ring-opened in an SN1-like fashion where the most substituted carbon gets preferentially attacked by water such that the nucleophile (water molecule) attacks the more substituted carbon atom (if steric factors allow), which results in a diol with essentially an "anti" addition of the hydroxyl groups.
    
However, the acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides usually follows a "trans" (anti) addition of a water molecule where one oxygen from the original epoxide ring is retained in the molecule forming a vicinal diol (1,2-diol). For a symmetric epoxide formed from a symmetric alkene, the product might be a single vicinal diol. However, for an asymmetric epoxide, the reaction proceeds via a backside attack on the more substituted carbon if there is a significant difference in the substitution (di or tri-substituted carbon vs. monosubstituted carbon). However, for a symmetric epoxide formed from a symmetric alkene, such as a straight chain oct-4-ene where the only difference would be the stereochemistry due to the E/Z isomer, the main question here is what happens specifically when (E)-oct-4-ene has been converted to a trans epoxide first.

Based on normal acid-catalyzed epoxide hydrolysis, the nucleophilic attack by water on the epoxide typically follows an SN$_2$-like mechanism where the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon if there is no strong preference such that the -OH group would be added "trans" to the other part of the epoxide.

Let us assume the acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening here mainly forms a vicinal diol such that the two hydroxyl groups should be in an anti relationship if the reaction proceeds predominantly through an SN$_2$ inversion at one carbon center. Thus, if starting with (4R,5S)-4-propyl-5-ethyl oxirane, upon reaction with aqueous acid, the product would be (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol where the hydroxyl groups are in an anti configuration for the diol itself.

### Step-by-step reasoning for Reaction 2 ((Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid):

1. **Reaction of (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA**:
    
    For the (Z)-oct-4-ene case, syn addition of an oxygen atom across the double bond would yield a "cis" epoxide such that the two propyl groups are now on the same side ("cis" epoxide).
    
$$
\mathrm{(Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA} \longrightarrow \text{(4\textbf{S},5\textbf{S})-4-propyl-5-ethyl oxirane}
$$

This epoxide has a (4S,5S) configuration where the "cis" part refers to the "cis" placement of the alkyl groups.

2. **Treatment of (Z)-oct-4-ene derived Epoxide with Aqueous Acid**:

    Similar to the case for the (E)-oct-4-ene, (4S,5S)-4-propyl-5-ethyl oxirane would be converted into a vicinal diol upon reaction with aqueous acid. Based on an SN2-like reaction mechanism for ring opening of the epoxide, the reaction results in an overall "anti" addition of water to the epoxide ring such that after opening of the (4S,5S)-epoxide (which is a "cis" epoxide), the product should be a diol where the hydroxyl groups maintain an anti relationship such that the product should be (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol formed via an "anti" opening reaction.

### Mixing Products of Reactions 1 and 2

We need to compare the products formed from Reactions 1 and 2:
    - From Reaction 1 (with (E)-oct-4-ene), the product is expected to be (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol (assuming "anti" addition of water).
    - From Reaction 2 (with (Z)-oct-4-ene), the product is expected to be (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol from an (4S,5S) epoxide ("anti" addition of water).

Analyzing these two products:
$$
\text{Reaction 1 product: (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol} \\
\text{Reaction 2 product: (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol}
$$
Let us identify if these two compounds are stereoisomers. 

1. **Are these two products enantiomers or diastereomers?**
For a molecule with two chiral centers (like octane-4,5-diol), enantiomers should be mirror images of each other where every chirality center has opposite stereoconfigurations. Thus, (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) are indeed mirror images of each other where one has (4R,5S) configuration and the other has (4S,5R) configuration where each chiral center is reversed. Thus, they are enantiomers.

However, one should also check whether there is any internal plane of symmetry making it a meso compound. A molecule such as (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol has a plane of symmetry if the two groups attached to carbons 4 and 5 (excluding the hydroxyl groups) are identical. However, for our case, the part of the molecule on one side of carbon 4 is CH3CH2CH2 (propyl), while on carbon 5 another part is again CH3CH2CH2 (propyl) such that the molecule is symmetric about a plane that bisects the molecule through carbon 4 and carbon 5 only if both (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) structures are meso compounds if both configurations yield identical molecules where the two "halves" are mirror images of themselves within a single molecule. Thus, what we need to verify is if (4R,5S) octane-4,5-diol has an internal plane of symmetry.

Let's draw the structures explicitly:
$$
\mathrm{(4\textbf{R},5\textbf{S})-octane-4,5-diol (from (E)-oct-4-ene)}:\\
\begin{array}c
\phantom{XXXXXX}_\mathrm{H} \text{ }\phantom{XXX}_\mathrm{H}\\
\phantom{XXXX}\setminus\phantom{XXXX}\setminus\\
\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2}-\underset{(4)}{\overset{(OH)}{\underset{(R)}{\mathrm{C}}^H}}-\underset{(5)}{\overset{(H)}{\underset{(S)}{\mathrm{C}}}^{OH}}-\mathrm{CH_2CH_2CH_3}\\
\phantom{XXXX}/\phantom{XXXX}/\\
\phantom{XXXXX}_\mathrm{H} \text{XXX }_\mathrm{H}\\
\end{array}
$$
However, we need to check if this structure itself is a meso compound. Another way to see if a compound has an internal plane of symmetry is to check whether the orientations of the two chiral centers cancel out the optical activity. 

Considering the other part of the molecule (which is symmetric around carbons 4 and 5):
$$
\text{(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol = meso compound}
$$
This implies that if you reverse the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, you get a (4S,5R) assignment which still represents the same molecular structure because of the symmetry within the molecule where the part "CH$_3$CH$_2$CH$_2$" appears on both sides for the (4R,5S) molecule including the two hydrogens on carbons 4 and 5. Therefore, the (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and the (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol actually describe the same compound which is a meso compound because the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes the chiral centers "cancel out" their optical activity and makes them identical.

The compound (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is indeed a meso compound because it has a plane of symmetry. So, when you consider the "mirror image" of (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol, it would be (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol. However, due to symmetry considerations, if you rotated the (4S,5R) structure and aligned it with (4R,5S), they would be identical. Hence, there should only be one meso compound representing both (4R,5S) and (4S,5R) configurations since they are superimposable after reorientation.

### Conclusion:

1. **Standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC Chromatogram**:
    
    After the chemist combines the products from Reactions 1 and 2, only one compound should be observed here because (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol is the same as (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol (which is a meso compound). Thus, there should be a single peak in an achiral reverse-phase HPLC column because achiral columns do not distinguish between enantiomers. However, in this case, there seems to be only one compound altogether formed because both reactions should produce a single meso compound identical in structure.

2. **Chiral HPLC Chromatogram**:

    A chiral HPLC column is designed to distinguish between enantiomers. Normally, if you had two enantiomers such as (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol, these would theoretically appear as two separate peaks in a chiral HPLC column. However, because (4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are not enantiomers here but actually refer to the same meso compound, any chiral HPLC column should still only show a single peak. 

Based on the reasoning process, the chemist should observe:
    
    - **A single peak on the achiral reverse-phase HPLC column for the combined product mixture.**
    - **A single peak on the chiral HPLC column for the combined product mixture as well.**

However, another critical part is that there should be a single product formed whose absolute configuration should be verified again explicitly if there is another meso form such as (4R,5R)-octane-4,5-diol or (4S,5S)-octane-4,5-diol formed. However, it seems instead that what we need to make absolutely sure is understanding why the answer should be such.

However, let us verify the meso compound's drawing explicitly:
$$
\text{(4R,5S)-octane-4,5-diol and (4S,5R)-octane-4,5-diol are meso compounds} \\
\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2-\overset{(4)}{\underset{(R)}{\underset{\downarrow}{\underset{\text{OH}}{\underset{\text{H}}{\underset{\text{CH_3CH_2CH_2}}{\mathrm{C}}}}}}}-\overset{(5)}{\underset{(S)}{\underset{\downarrow}{\underset{\text{H}}{\underset{\text{OH}}{\underset{\text{CH_2CH_2CH_3}}{\mathrm{C}}}}}}}}
$$
But one should make sure that there is no unnecessary claim that (4R,5S) is superimposable on (4S,5R) via a rotation or internal reflection. To make an informed decision here, let us draw another possible epoxide (and thus another diol formed).
Thus alternate possible epoxides are:
$$
(4R,5R) \text{ or (4S,5S)}
$$
These two should be distinct from what we previously assumed. Another potential product's configuration might be (4S,5S) for the "cis" epoxide derived from (Z)-oct-4-ene could be argued. However, the main point here is that the "syn" addition reaction should keep the "syn" part while forming the epoxide; thus epoxidation makes:
$$
(E)-oct-4-ene \rightarrow trans-(4R,5S) \text{ (or alternatively (4S,5R))}\\
(Z)-oct-4-ene \rightarrow cis-eposide-(4R,5R) \text{ or (4S,5S)}
$$
However, the stereochemistry of epoxidation is such that the epoxidation proceeds through a synchronous process where the "absolute" configuration should be such that the "trans" or "cis" part mentioned should reflect the initial E or Z structure respectively. 

Thus, (E)-oct-4-ene generates trans-epoxide where the propyl groups remain trans so that:
$$
(E)-oct-4-ene \rightarrow (4\textbf{R},5\textbf{S})-epoxide \text{ or (4S,5R) due to syn-effect during epoxidation.}
$$
Hence once hydrolyzed:
$$
(4\text{R},5\text{S})-epoxide \rightarrow anti-addition-of-hydroxyls i.e., (4R,5S)-diol.
$$
Conversely:
$$
(Z)-oct-4-ene \rightarrow (4\text{S},5\text{S})-epoxide \text{(thus "cis" epoxide).}
Hence once hydrolyzed:
(4S,5S)-epoxide \rightarrow anti-addition-of-hydroxyls i.e., (4\text{S},5S)-diol.
$$
These two diols should be different. Moreover, while reagent's stereospecificity means that:
1. (E)-configured alkene should give a "trans" epoxide while Z gives a "cis" epoxide.
2. Upon acid-catalyzed ring opening which is generally "trans" (anti addition of water), the initial "trans" epoxide makes a (4R,5S) or (4S,5R) vicinal diol. However, the "cis" epoxide generates a (4S,5S) or alternatively (4R,5R) vicinal diol product.

Now, the forms (4R,5S) and (4
