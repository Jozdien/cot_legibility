To analyze how Maxwell's equations might change in a universe where magnetic monopoles (i.e., isolated north or south poles) exist, let's recall the standard Maxwell's equations in our universe where no magnetic monopoles have been observed. The standard Maxwell's equations are:

1. Gauss's law for electricity:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
$$
where $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $\rho$ is the charge density, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

2. Gauss's law for magnetism (which states that magnetic monopoles do not exist):
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
$$
where $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.

3. Faraday's law of induction:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
$$
where $t$ denotes time.

4. Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$$
where $$\mu_0$$ is the permeability of free space and $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density.

Because magnetic monopoles have never been observed in our universe, the second equation above (Gauss's law for magnetism) states that the divergence of the magnetic field is always zero (i.e., no magnetic charges). 

However, if magnetic monopoles did exist, there would be an equivalent of charge density for magnetic charges (usually denoted as $\rho_m$, indicating "magnetic charge density"), and Gauss’s law for magnetism would need to be modified such that:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\rho_m,
$$
(Note that some sources might use a different constant such as $\rho_m$ directly without $\mu_0$, but the inclusion of $\mu_0$ makes it analogous to the form of Gauss’s law for electricity where $\epsilon_0$ is used in $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho / \epsilon_0$. Another common form is simply $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m$, where $\rho_m$ represents the magnetic charge density directly.)

To match symmetrically with the electric case where we have:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}
$$
which has a units check of $\frac{\text{charge density}}{\text{permittivity}}$, a symmetric Gauss’s law for magnetism might typically be written as:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m,
$$
where $\rho_m$ is the magnetic monopole charge density (which would be analogous to the electric charge density $\rho$). However, for unit consistency and keeping a symmetry between electric and magnetic equations, a likely candidate for a "magnetic charge density" term might replace "0" in the Gauss's law for magnetism equation.

However, if magnetic monopoles exist, another part of Maxwell's equations must also change: Faraday’s law might need a symmetric treatment so that a changing electric field could generate magnetic monopole currents (similar to how a changing magnetic field generates an electric current in Faraday’s law). However, Faraday’s law itself might stay the same unless one also considers a magnetic current density $\mathbf{J}_m$ (which would be the magnetic counterpart to electric current density $\mathbf{J}$). Thus, Faraday’s law might be adjusted similarly to Ampère's law with a "magnetic current" term if magnetic charges can move and create a "magnetic current" $\mathbf{J}_m$:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}{\partial t} - \mu_0\mathbf{J}_m
$$
However, a more commonly suggested symmetric form is:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}.
$$
However, such a term $\mathbf{J}_m$ should only be introduced if there is a "magnetic current" analogous to electric current.

Another part where an additional term might appear is in Ampère’s law if one wishes to maintain symmetry. However, that seems already fine unless there is a need to directly introduce a magnetic charge current term explicitly (which is not typically part of Ampère’s law).

However, a well-known symmetrical form of Maxwell's equations that includes magnetic charges and magnetic currents might be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}, \\
&\nabla \cdot\mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m \\
&\nabla \times \mathbf{-E}=\mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m + \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}, \\
&\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t},
\end{aligned}
$$
However, another representation found in some texts would be defined thusly:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4 \pi \rho_e \\
&\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 4\pi \rho_m \\
&\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - 4 \pi \mathbf{J}_m \\
&\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} + 4\pi \mathbf{J}_e
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\rho_e$ is the conventional electric charge density (usually denoted simply as $\rho$ in the first set of equations) and $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density. Similarly, $\mathbf{J}_e$ refers to the electric current density, while $\mathbf{J}_m$ refers to the magnetic current density. This uses Gaussian units where $c$, $\epsilon_0,$ and $\mu_0$ are normalized such that the equations take this symmetric form.

Based on such a symmetry argument, the most fundamental change is that Gauss's law for magnetism should change from:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
$$
to something like:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m,
$$
where $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density.

Additionally, Faraday’s law should be expanded such that:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m,
$$
where $\mathbf{J}_m$ is magnetic current density.

However, the question asks which of Maxwell’s equations would be different if there were magnetic monopoles. The answer should center on Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law might need an additional term if magnetic charges can move creating magnetic current.

However, what is usually emphasized in such a hypothetical case where magnetic monopoles exist is that Gauss’s law for magnetism should be changed first and foremost because:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
$$
would need an additional term for the magnetic charge density. Another valid part that needs a potential modification might be another term in Faraday's law which characterizes the electric field generated by a moving magnetic charge or a changing magnetic charge density.)

However, the most commonly stated changes are:
1. Gauss's law for magnetism should be changed from $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$ to some form such as $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m$ where $\rho_m$ is magnetic charge density.
2. Faraday’s law might be modified to include a term for magnetic current density (as shown previously).

Based on the provided reasoning, the most significant and necessary change is Gauss’s law for magnetism. Another potential change might be Faraday’s law.

Based on the question statement, which seeks which equations would be different, the main candidates thus seem to be:
1) Gauss’s law for magnetism.
2) Faraday’s law of induction might need an additional term due to magnetic current.

However, the most commonly accepted and well-known change would be **Gauss’ Law for magnetism**.

Hence, the answer thus should be:

**Specifically, "Gauss’ Law for magnetism" would certainly need to be modified from $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$ to something like $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = (\text{magnetic charge density})$. An additional term might need to be incorporated into another one of Maxwell’s equations such as Faraday’s.**

However, if by "isolated North or South pole" the question refers solely to the implication on Gauss’s law for magnetism, that could be the only one strictly required to be changed. However, for full symmetry, another equation which might require a change should be Faraday’s law such that:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} (\text{if no magnetic currents}) \text{ or } \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = - \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mathbf{J_m} \text{ (including magnetic current term)}.
$$
The most typically emphasized change is usually only on Gauss’s law for magnetism:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m.
$$
Thus, a commonly proposed full set of Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}, \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= \mu_0 \rho_m, \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J_m}, \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} &= \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \mathbf{J}.
\end{aligned}
$$
However, the most common and necessary change is definitely:
**Gauss's law for magnetism**
and probably **Faraday's law of induction**.

Thus, a brief answer would be:
**In a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles exist, the equations that need to be changed are primarily Gauss's law for magnetism, changing from $\nabla \mathbf{\cdot B} = 0$ to an equation including a magnetic charge density term such as $\nabla \mathbf{\cdot B} = \mu_0 \rho_m$. Additionally, Faraday's law could be amended to include a "magnetic current" term such as $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m$ where $\mathbf{J}_m$ is the magnetic current density resulting from moving magnetic charges.**

Based on the question, the answer should thus be:
The two Maxwell equations that change should be:
1. Gauss's law for magnetism (originally $\nabla\mathbf{\cdot B} = 0$) should be modified.
2. Possibly also Faraday's law should be modified to include a term for magnetic current $\mathbf{J}_m$.

However, the question requires us to identify which equations should specifically be different. The most common description usually focuses on:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m \ (\text{or a similar non-zero right-hand side})
$$
and Faraday’s law might be:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J_m}.
$$
However, a major term that directly reflects isolated monopoles (north or south poles) is the change from $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$ to some nonzero term representing the magnetic charge density.

Thus, the answer could be summarized as follows:
The two Maxwell's equations that should be modified due to the existence of magnetic monopoles are Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday’s law.
Another way to put it could be:
Gauss's law for magnetism needs to be altered such that:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \alpha \rho_m,
$$
where $\alpha$ is a constant (which might be numerically equal to $\mu_0$).
Additionally, Faraday’s law might require a magnetic current term such that:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}.
$$
However, the primarily recognized change is Gauss's law for magnetism shifting from $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$ to a form including a term for magnetic charge density.

Thus, explicitly, the most important one is:
**Gauss's law for magnetism should be updated because isolated magnetic charges (monopoles) would make the magnetic field divergence non-zero where magnetic monopoles exist.**
