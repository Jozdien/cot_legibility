# Original Question

A synchrocyclotron is a special type of cyclotron. A proton is injected at \$t=0\$ with negligible kinetic energy, i.e. \$T\simeq0\$ undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy \$T{1}=950MeV\$. The alternating voltage applied in the accelerator is given by
U\left(t\right)=U{0}\cos\left[2\pi\nu\left(\alpha\right)t+\Phi_{0}\right].

How many revolutions does the proton make in the synchrocyclotron?
Data : \$\Phi{0}=\frac{\pi}{4},U{0}=190kV\$.

To solve for the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron until it reaches a kinetic energy $T_1 = 950\,\text{MeV}$, we need to understand how a synchrocyclotron operates differently from a classical cyclotron. 

A classical cyclotron uses a constant magnetic field $B$ and a constant frequency $\nu$ (frequency of the alternating voltage $U(t) = U_0\cos(2\pi\nu t + \Phi_0)$), where $\nu$ is usually given by the cyclotron frequency $\nu = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}$ where $q$ is the charge of the particle (which for a proton is $q = e$), and $m$ is the rest mass of relativistic mass of the particle. However, as the proton gains energy (and thus velocity increases), the relativistic mass increases according to the formula $m = \gamma m_0$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass of the proton ($m_0 \approx 938.27\,\text{MeV}/c^2$), and $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}}$.

However, if the cyclotron frequency remains constant, the proton will drift out of phase with the alternating electric field because its mass increases (which decreases the cyclotron frequency $\nu = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}$ if $m$ increases due to relativistic effects). A synchrocyclotron addresses this by decreasing the frequency of the alternating electric field such that it matches the decreasing cyclotron frequency (since $\gamma$ increases with velocity $v$, causing the effective frequency $\nu_{\text{eff}} = \frac{qB}{2\pi\gamma m_0}$ to decrease).

The question mentions that alternating voltage applied is:
$$
U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]
$$
where the given values are $\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}$, $U_0 = 190\,\text{kV}$. However, what is not explicitly given here is what $\nu(\alpha)$ represents explicitly. Typically, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency $\nu$ is a function such that it decreases with time (or as the proton's relativistic mass increases). However, here it seems $\nu(\alpha)$ might be a function of another variable $\alpha$, perhaps related to the magnetic field or relativistic mass. 

However, a synchrocyclotron is typically operated such that the proton gains kinetic energy mainly through crossing an accelerating gap which has an alternating voltage $U(t)$. The total energy gain per crossing this gap is twice $qU_0$ (since a round trip involves crossing twice if the potential alternates such that one crossing accelerates and another crossing does too if the phase is properly synchronized). However, the net energy gain per round trip (which involves two crossings given that the phase is well-timed) is usually $|eU_0\cos(\phi)|$ on average over a round trip where $\phi$ is the phase when the proton crosses the gap. When the proton is synchronized such that it crosses the gap at the peak voltage $U_0$ (whenever $\cos\phi = \pm 1$), the energy gain per round trip can be approximated as $2eU_0$ if the phase is such that the proton always crosses when voltage is close to $U_0$, while a round-trip happens once every revolution. 

However, what we need to find here is the number of revolutions until the proton reaches a kinetic energy $T_1 = 950\,\text{MeV}$. 

The question mentions that the proton is injected at $t=0$ with negligible kinetic energy $T \approx 0$. Thus, the total energy $E$ (total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy) is:
$$
E = T + m_0c^2,
$$
where $m_0 c^2 \approx 938.27\,\text{MeV}$ (rest mass energy of the proton). 

The total energy can also be expressed as:
$$
E = \gamma m_0 c^2,
$$
such that the kinetic energy itself $T$ is:
$$
T = E - m_0 c^2 = (\gamma - 1) m_0 c^2.
$$

Since the question states that the proton reaches a kinetic energy $T_1 = 950\,\text{MeV}$, using $T_1 = 950\,\text{MeV}$,
$$
T_1 = (\gamma - 1)m_0 c^2,
$$
$$
950\,\text{MeV} = (\gamma - 1) \times 938.27\,\text{MeV}.
$$
Thus,
$$
\gamma - 1 = \frac{950}{938.27} \approx 1.0125,
$$
$$
\gamma \approx 1.0125 + 1 = ~{}2.0125.
$$
(However, you might check the accuracy here because:
$$
950\,\text{MeV} = (\gamma - 1) \times 938.27\,\text{MeV} \text{ should yield } 950 = 938.27(\gamma - 1) \Rightarrow \gamma - 1 = \frac{950}{938.27} \approx 1.0125.
$$
However, it makes sense that $\gamma \approx 2.0125$.

To find out the total energy $E = T + m_0 c^2$ when $T_1 = 950\, \text{MeV}$:
$$
E = T + m_0 c^2 \\ = 950\, \text{MeV} + 938.27\,\text{MeV} \approx 1888.27\,\text{MeV}.
$$

In a synchrocyclotron, the proton makes two passes through the accelerating gap per revolution because after half a cycle (which is a part of one full revolution in the magnetic field), the proton crosses the accelerating gap once; thus crossing it again after another half cycle thus crossing it once per half revolution which makes two passes per revolution. 

However, the amount of energy gained per pass through the gap could be $eU_0\cos\phi$, where $\phi$ is the phase when crossing the gap ($\phi = 2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \validate{\Phi_0}$ where $\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}$ here). However, for an "ideal" case where the particle always arrives at an ideal accelerating phase such that the full $qU_0$ might be utilized if $\cos(\phi) = 1$, but that is an ideal case where the particle always arrives when voltage is near its maximum (positive or negative depending on the charge of the particle).

Thus finding the total energy gain per round trip can be a bit more complex because it depends on the phase. However, a round trip here probably means one full revolution where the proton passes through the gap twice. For simplicity assume that each time it crosses the gap when the voltage is close to its peak (i.e., $ \pm U_0$), such that one round trip gains at most $2eU_0$. 

However, another statement often used in a synchrocyclotron is that the "effective" energy gain per round trip could approximate an effective $eU_0$ on average. Another common way is that one crossing might make it gain energy $eU_0\cos\phi$, so that per round trip if the phase is such that acceleration always adds energy (charge $e$, so gain energy $eU_0\cos\phi$ for crossing when voltage is $U_0\cos\phi$), the total gain might be:
$$
\Delta E = 2 \cdot eU_0 \cos\phi,
$$
However, the question should make an approximation such that whenever crossing the gap if the voltage is $U_0\cos(\phi)$, the gain is $eU_0\cos(\phi)$, thus the round trip which includes crossing twice makes the total energy gain $2eU_0\cos\phi$. 

However, a more idealistic and easier approximation sometimes used is that if the particle is synchronized such that it always encounters the same phase $\phi$ such that:
$$
\Delta E = eU_0.
$$
However, a more realistic picture is that if the particle is always in-phase such that it always crosses the gap when the voltage is at $U_0$, the gain per crossing could ideally be $eU_0$, thus $2eU_0$ per round trip.

But here let us assume that the round-trip (i.e., one full revolution) makes the proton cross the gap twice such that the total energy gain per round trip would be $2eU_0$ if the proton crosses when the voltage is at its amplitude which is $U_0$. However, by "crossing the gap twice per round trip," the question might be asking us to solve for how many round trips until reaching $T_1 = 950\,\text{MeV}$.

Let $n$ denote the number of round trips (which is also the number of revolutions in this case), and assume that every round trip, the particle gains $2eU_0$ energy:
$$
2eU_0 \cdot n = T_1.
$$
But here $U_0 = 190\,\text{kV} = 190 \times 10^3\,\text{V}$, thus:
$$
2 \times e \times 190 \times 10^3\,\text{V} \times n = \text{kinetic energy in joules}.
$$
However, $T_1 = 950\,\text{MeV}$ should be transformed if necessary into joules (but it makes sense to keep the unit consistent).

The elementary charge $e \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\,\text{C}$ and $1\,\text{MeV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-13}\,\text{J}$:
$$
T_1 = 950\, \text{MeV} = 950 \times 10^6\,\text{eV} = 950 \times 10^6 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\,\text{J}.
$$
However, what we need here is only the amount of energy gain in electron volts rather than joules because the question is about energy gain directly measured in electron volts:
$$
T_1 = 950 \times 10^6\,\eV.
$$
Considering:
$$
2eU_0 n = T_1,
$$
Using electron volts directly for $U_0$:
$$
2 \times (190 \times 10^3\,\text{V}) \times n\,\text{revolutions} = T_1.
$$
But $1\,\text{V} \times e = 1\,\text{eV}$ so:
$$
2 \times 190 \times 10^3\, \text{eV} \times n = 950 \times 10^6\,\text{eV}.
$$
Thus:
$$
380 \times 10^3 \times n = 950 \times 10^6.
$$
$$
n = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{380 \times 10^3} = \frac{950 \times 10^3}{380} = \frac{950000}{380} \approx 2500.
$$
Therefore, the number of revolutions $n$ would be rounded to $2500$ revolutions.

Verifying again: total energy gain per round trip could be viewed as:
$$
\Delta E_{\text{round trip}} = 2 \times 190 \times 10^3 \,\text{eV} = 380 \times 10^3 \,\text{eV} = 380\,\text{keV}.
$$
Total energy gain per round trip is thus $380\,\text{keV}$, which is:
$$
380 \times 10^3\,\text{eV} = 380\,\text{keV} = 0.380\,\text{MeV}.
$$
Total rounds needed to reach a kinetic energy gain of $950\,\text{MeV}$ would be:
$$
\frac{950\,\text{MeV}}{0.38\,\text{MeV}} \approx 2500.
$$
However, a round trip means one full revolution where there are two passes through the gap where energy gain is $eU_0$. 

Hence, the number of revolutions is:
$$\boxed{2500}$$

However, it seems that there might be a mistake in the analysis regarding the reasoning on the total energy gain per round trip. Generally, a round trip might only gain $2eU_0$, where $U_0$ is in volts so $2eU_0$ is in eV. However, $U_0 = 190\,\text{kV}$, so $U_0 = 190 \times 10^3\,\text{V}$, so the voltage's real impact on energy gain should be $2 \times 190\,\text{kV} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\,\text{C}$, if we need to keep the unit consistent but as noted here, for round trip:
$$
2 \times 190 \times 10^3\,\text{eV} \text{ gain per round trip}.
$$

Thus, our answer looks well reasoned and plausible. Thus, by having a round trip defined here as crossing the gap twice and thus making one full revolution seems valid.

Double checking the order of magnitude makes sense:
$$
950\,\text{MeV} = 950 \times 10^6\,\text{eV}.
$$
The round trip energy gain makes sense:
$$
2 \times 190 \times 10^3\,\text{eV} = 3.8 \times 10^5\,\text{eV} = 0.38\,\text{MeV}.
$$
$$
n = \frac{950}{0.38} \times 1000 = 2500.
$$

Hence, the answer seems well verified. 

To make sure what the reasoning here matches up with the round trip descripment, the main statement we need here is just an understanding that the energy gain per round trip is proportional to $ U_0$. 

Another verification could be checking what the total energy gain until the kinetic energy reaches especially through total round trips until reaching the desired kinetic energy. Thus another step might be to compute the actual final total energy or kinetic energy explicitly makes:
$$
\tag{1}
T_{\text{final}} = n \times 0.38\,\text{MeV}.
$$

So, $2500$ round trips would give us a total kinetic energy gain of:
$$
2500 \times 0.38\,\text{MeV} = 950\,\text{MeV}.
$$
Thus, the answer seems quite solidly reasoned.
