# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.

To solve for the given question, we need to understand how the effective temperature of the star changes when part of its surface is covered by dark spots. 

When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, it has an effective temperature $T_{\text{eff, unspotted}}=6000 \;\text{K}$, a solar radius $R = 1.5 R_{\odot}$ (where $R_{\odot}$ is the solar radius), and a solar mass $M = 1.1 M_{\odot}$ (where $M_{\odot}$ is the solar mass).

However, when $40\%$ of the star's surface is covered by dark spots, astronomers observe that the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to $T_{\text{eff, spotted}} = 5500\;\text{K}$.

The question states that astronomers need to find how the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. The wavelength of the transition between these two energy levels is approximately $1448$ Å.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Total luminosity without spots can be described using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:**
$$
L_{\text{unspotted}} = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff, unspotted}}^4,
$$
where $R = 1.5 R_{\odot}$, $T_{\text{eff, unspotted}} = 6000\;\text{K}$, and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

2. **For the case when $40\%$ of the stellar surface is covered by dark spots, let $T_s$ be the effective temperature of the spots and $T_n$ be the effective temperature of the "normal" part of the stellar surface (i.e., the part not covered by spots). Since $40\%$ of the surface is covered by spots, the remaining $60\%$ of the surface has a temperature $T_n$. 

However, what we need to do here is find the total luminosity and equate it to the observed effective temperature $5500\,\text{K}$ for the spotted case. Let $A = 4 \pi R^2$ be the total surface area of the star. The luminosity from the normal part (60% of the star's surface) would be:
$$
L_{\text{normal part}} = 0.6 A \sigma T_n^4.
$$
The luminosity from the spotted part (40% of the star's surface) would be:
$$
L_{\text{spot part}} = 0.4 A \sigma T_s^4.
$$
The total luminosity when $40\%$ of the star’s surface is covered by spots is thus:
$$
L_{\text{total, spotted}} = A \sigma (0.6 T_n^4 + 0.4 T_s^4).
$$
However, such a total luminosity can also be represented by another effective temperature $T_{\text{eff, spotted}}$:
$$
L_{\text{total, spotted}} = A \sigma T_{\text{eff, spotted}}^4.
$$
Based on the statement, $T_{\text{eff, spotted}} = 5500\;\text{K}$, so:
$$
L_{\text{total, spotted}} = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma (5500)^4.
$$
Since $A\sigma T_{\text{eff, spotted}}^4 = A \sigma (0.6 T_n^4 + 0.4 T_s^4)$, it follows that:
$$
T_{\text{eff, spotted}}^4 = (0.6) T_n^4 + (0.4) T_s^4.
$$
However, we need to consider what $T_n$ should be here. 

#### Assuming $T_n = T_{\text{eff, unspotted}}$:

For the part of the surface that is not covered by spots ("normal" stellar surface), it is reasonable to assume that it retains the same effective temperature as the unspotted star's surface (i.e., $T_n = 6000 \text{ K}$). Thus:
$$
(5500)^4 = 0.6 \times (6000)^4 + 0.4 \times T_s^4,
$$
where $T_s$ is the unknown spot temperature. Thus, solving for $T_s^4$:
$$
(5500)^4 = 0.6 \times (6000)^4 + 0.4 \times T_s^4,
$$
or:
$$
(5500)^4 - 0.6 \times (6000)^4 = 0.4 \times T_s^4,
$$
or:
$$
T_s^4 = \frac{(5500)^4 - 0.6 \times (6000)^4}{0.4}.
$$
Evaluating individually:
$$
(5500)^4 \approx 9.15 \times 10^{14},
$$
$$
(6000)^4 \approx 1.3 \times 10^{15},
$$
$$
0.6 \times (6000)^4 = 0.6 \times 1.3 \times 10^{15} \approx 7.8 \times 10^{14},
$$
$$
(5500)^4 ≈ 9.15 \times 10^{14} \text{ (where $5500^4 = 9150625 \times 10^6$)}.
$$
Thus,
$$
(5500)^4 - 0.6 \times (6000)^4 ≈ 9.15 \times 10^{14} - 7.8 \times 10^{14} = 1.35 \times 10^{14}.
$$
We divide this result by $0.4$:
$$
T_s^4 = \frac{1.35 \times 10^{14}}{0.4} = 3.375 \times 10^{14}.
$$
$$
T_s = (3.375 \times 10^{14})^{1/4} \approx 4285.6 \text{ K}.
$$
We round it appropriately if necessary. Hence $T_s \approx 4285.6 \text{K}$ would presumably be the temperature of the "dark spots."

However, one should verify such a result by checking the other part of the question related to the ratio of titanium atoms numbers in two energy levels given that the star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

#### To find the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels $n_1, n_2$ ($n_1$ for level 1 and $n_2$ for level 2), we need to use Boltzmann's distribution law:
$$
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
$$
where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) of energy levels $1$ and $2$, $\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels (which can be expressed as $E_2 - E_1$, where $\Delta E = \frac{h c}{\lambda}$ here), $k$ is Boltzmann’s constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

Since the question states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of $1448$ Å which is $1448 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}$, the energy difference $\Delta E$ is:
$$
\Delta E = \frac{h c}{\lambda}.
$$
The Boltzmann distribution can be expressed further explicitly as:
$$
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{h c}{\lambda k T}\right),
$$
where $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}$), $c$ is the speed of light ($3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$), $\lambda$ is the given wavelength ($1448 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}$), and $k$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}$). 

However, what we need is the relative ratios between the cases when the star does not have spots (only one temperature $6000 \text{ K})$ versus when $40\%$ of the star’s surface is covered by spots (which means we need to compare the "normal" part temperature which is still asserted to be $6000 \text{ K}$ and the part covered by spots which seems to have a temperature $T_s \approx 4285.6 \text{ K}$). But this needs clarification on what part of the photosphere we need when the star does indeed have spots on $40\%$ of its surface. 

However, what seems important here is the "overall" effective temperature which appears to be $5500 \text{ K}$ when $40\%$ of the star's surface is covered by spots. However, the observed "overall" effective temperature might be a "combined" or "averaged" effect where the blending of two different temperatures creates a single observed $T_{\text{eff, spotted}}$. 

Another part of the question states that the "ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 decreases when the star has spots." So what matters now is finding the actual overall ratio $\frac{n_2}{n_1}$ when the star has spots compared to the case when there are no spots. 

#### When the star has no spots, the single effective temperature is $T_{\text{eff}}=6000 \text{ K}$. 

The ratio when the star does not have spots is thus:
$$
\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{6000K} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{h c}{\lambda k \cdot 6000}\right).
$$

However, when $40\%$ of the surface is covered by dark spots, two different temperatures exist simultaneously on the star’s surface.
    
It seems that the question might be implying that what astronomers observe is an "averaged" measurement of the two different temperatures. However, what we need to find is the "overall" ratio $\frac{n_2}{n_1}$ when the star has spots compared to when it doesn’t have spots. Due to the localized nature of the "line" observations, what we need is a "flux-weighted" average of the quantity $\frac{n_2}{n_1}$.

Let us analyze the total emitted flux for each part of the star separately. However, it seems what matters here might be the "mean" ratio of atoms in the two energy levels (which should be an average over the observed part of the star). Another possible way might be given that only a fraction of the stellar flux comes from the spots whose temperature is $T_s$, while the rest comes from normal part whose temperature is $T_{\text{eff, unspotted}}$ (i.e., $6000 \text{ K}$).

However, a more accurate way to make sense of the "overall" ratio $(\frac{n_2}{n_1})_{\text{overall}}$ would be to assume that the "total sampled flux" is a mixture of fluxes from two regions (60% of the surface at $6000 \text{ K}$ and $40\%$ of the surface at $T_s \approx 4285.6 \text{ K}$). 

To find the resultant value for the total observation (since the question mentions that the "ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti decreases when the star has spots"), we need to compare the flux contributions from both regions where each part contributes to the total flux observed. 

To make a weighted average of the population ratios $\frac{n_2}{n_1}$ defined by:
$$
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp(-\frac{hc}{\lambda kT}),
$$
the main contributing part here needs to be defined properly. However, $n_1$ and $n_2$ indicate particle densities which depend on the local temperature $T$. 

This means that when making an integral over the star's surface, the "observed" $(n_2/n_1)$ cannot be directly made by simply taking a fraction-weighted average such as $0.6 \times (n_2 / n_1)_{6000K} + 0.4 \times (n_2 / n_1)_{Ts}$ because $(n_2 / n_1)$ is specific to each part of the star based on its local temperature.

Instead, what we likely observe is a flux-weighted averaged spectrum where the part at $6000 \text{ K}$ contributes greater flux (since it has a higher temperature) compared to the part at $4285.6 \text{ K}$. However, one might need an equation describing the total flux at the given wavelength $1448 \text{ Å}$:
$$
F_{\text{wavelength}} = F_{\text{6000K}}(0.6) + F_{\text{4285.6K}}(0.4),
$$
where $F_{\text{6000K}}$ is the emitted flux per unit area for the part of the star at $6000 \text{ K}$ and $F_{\text{4285.6K}}$ for the part of the star at $4285.6 \text{ K}$. 

Another part of the "total flux" at a given wavelength could be described via Planck’s law:
$$
B_{\lambda}(T)d\lambda = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5}\frac{d\lambda}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k T}} - 1},
$$
However, what we need here seems another way to aggregate $(n_2 / n_1)$ correctly. Another straight-forward way might be:
$$
\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{total}} = \frac{n_2^{\text{tot}}}{n_1^{\text{tot}}} \approx \frac{0.6 (n_2)_{6000} + 0.4 (n_2)_{T_s}}{0.6 (n_1)_{6000} + 0.4 (n_1)_{T_s}}.
$$
However, let us call $n_{\text{total}}$ the total number of neutral Ti atoms (which itself might need to be split into $0.6 n_{\text{total}}$ for the $6000 \text{ K}$ part and $0.4 n_{\text{total}}$ for the $T_s$ part. Assume $N_{\text{Ti}}$ is total Ti atom number:
$$
n_1^{\text{tot}} = 0.6 \cdot N_{\text{Ti}} \rho_1(6000) + 0.4 \cdot N_{\text{Ti}} \rho_1(T_s),
$$
$$
n_2^{\text{tot}} = 0.6 \cdot N_{\text{Ti}} \rho_2(6000) + 0.4 \cdot N_{\text{Ti}} \rho_public_{2}(T_s),
$$
where $\rho_1(T)$ and $\rho_2(T)$ represent the fraction of total Ti atoms in levels $1$ and $2$ at a given temperature $T$, such that:
$$
\rho_i(T) = \frac{n_i}{N_{\text{Ti}}}.
$$
Furthermore, using Boltzmann’s equation:
$$
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(\frac{- (E_2 - E_1)}{k T}\right) = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(\frac{-hc}{\lambda k T}\right) = K \exp\left(\frac{-hc}{\lambda k T}\right),
$$
where $K = \frac{g_2}{g_1}$ is a constant. Thus,
$$
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = K \exp\left(-\frac{hc}{\lambda k}\cdot\frac{1}{T}\right).
$$
Another part of the total $n_1$ and $n_2$ values would be given by $n_{\text{total}}$ which is the total number of neutral Ti atoms in thermal equilibrium such that:
$$
n_1 + n_2 \approx N_{1} \text{ (total number of neutral Ti atoms in any energy state for one part of the star's surface)}
$$
However another point here reads that we need to compare the ratio of $\frac{n_2}{n_1}$ when the star is not covered by spots (having a single $6000 \text{ K}$ temperature) vs. when $40\%$ of its surface is covered by spots (which gives us an overall $5500 \text{ K}$ effective temperature).

First, solve explicitly for $\frac{n_2}{n_1}$ for $6000 \text{ K}$:
$$
\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{6000 K}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{h c}{\lambda k \cdot 6000}\right).
$$

Calculate the numerical exponent $\frac{h c}{\lambda k \cdot 6000}$:
$$
\frac{h c}{\lambda k \times 6000} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{1448 \times 10^{-10} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 6000} \approx \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1448 \times 10^{-10} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 6000} \approx \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.1998 \times 10^{-14}} \approx 16.567.
$$
Thus:
$$
\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{6000 K}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp(-16.567).
$$
The question requires us to find the "factor" by which this ratio changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. To find this, let us do the same for $T_s\approx 4285.6 \text{ K}$:
$$
\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{Ts} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{h c}{\lambda k \cdot 4285.6}\right).
$$
Calculate the exponent $\frac{h c}{\lambda k\cdot4285.6}$:
$$
\frac{h c}{\lambda k \times 4285.6} \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{1448 \times 10^{-10} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-cmath}{-23} \times 4285.6} \approx \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1448
