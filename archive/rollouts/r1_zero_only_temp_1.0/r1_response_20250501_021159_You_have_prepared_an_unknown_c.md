# Original Question

You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

To solve for which compound fits the given FTIR and 1H NMR spectral data, let us analyze the given possibilities one by one. 

The question mentions that the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. 

1. **The broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ typically indicates the presence of an O-H stretching vibration from a carboxylic acid (–COOH group).**
2. **The strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is also commonly found in carboxylic acids where the C=O stretch usually appears around 1700 cm⁻¹.**

These two observations together suggest that the unknown compound likely contains a carboxylic acid group (–COOH).

The question also mentions that several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum and specifically mentions that "none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens," which means that there are no hydrogens attached to carbon atoms that are part of a double bond (i.e., no H-C=C).

Another important piece of information given is that one of the signals in the 1H NMR is a "doublet of triplets of quartets" while another signal is a "doublet of triplets of triplets."

#### Analyzing the candidates:
Let us label these compounds:

1. CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH
    Breaking down the compound CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH into substructures:
    - CH3CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)COOH (where the "C(H)" has been replaced with "CH" for clarity)
    
2. CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
    Similarly, for CH3CH2CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)COOH:
    
3. CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
    For CH3CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2COOH:
    
4. CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
    For CH3CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)CH2COOH:

To solve for the splitting patterns for the hydrogens on the asymmetric carbon atoms (i.e., chiral centers where there is a carbon atom attached to four different groups), we need to understand what a "doublet of triplets" or a "doublet of triplets of quartets" means. Such a splittings pattern is determined via the "n+1 rule" where "n" is the number of neighboring protons on adjacent carbon atoms. 

### Doublet of triplets of triplets would imply a splitting due to one proton (doublet, n=1), three protons (triplet, n=2), and again three protons (another triplet, n=2). To make a "doublet of triplets of quartets," there needs to be one proton giving rise to the doublet (n=1), two protons giving rise to a triplet (n=2), and three protons giving rise to a quartet (n=3).

To interpret the "doublet of triplets of quartets" signal, the total number of components in the resulting multiplet could be calculated by multiplying the components from each part of the splitting:
$$
\text{(doublet components = 2)} \times \text{(triplet components = 3)} \times \text{(quartets components = 4)} = 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24
$$
However, if a signal is a "doublet of triplets of quartets," the total splittings should be 24 lines unless some of the J-coupling constants are accidentally degenerate (i.e., equal).

Similarly, a "doublet of triplets of triplets" splitting pattern could be interpreted as:
$$
\text{(doublet components = 2)} \times \text{(triplet components = 3)} \times \text{(triplet components = 3)} = 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 18
$$

#### For the first compound, CH3CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)COOH:

Let us name the carbon atoms systematically such that:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-CH(CH_3)-CH(CH_3)-COOH}
$$
1. Carbon atoms are labeled such that CH3 (1) is attached to the first CH2 (2), which is connected to the third carbon atom (3) (which has both a hydrogen atom and a CH3 group attached to it). This third carbon atom connects to another carbon atom (4) which also has a hydrogen and a CH3 group attached to it. Finally, carbon atom (4) is connected to a carboxylic acid group (COOH).
    
To identify the 1H NMR spectrum signals, let us write out the structure explicitly as:
$$\mathrm{H_3C-CH_2-\overset{H}{\underset{CH_3}{\overset{|}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{C}}}}}-\overset{H}{\underset{CH_3}{\overset{|}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{C}}}}-COOH}}$$
Let us identify the hydrogens and their splitting patterns explicitly:

1. The first CH3 (labeled as "CH3-CH2"):
    - This CH3 group should appear as a triplet (due to the neighboring CH2 group which has two protons).
    
2. The CH2 (labeled as "CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)"):
    - The CH2 group here could be split by the CH3 group (giving a quartet pattern) and by the CH(CH3) group (which has one hydrogen atom, so another coupling happens which simplifies the splitting into a multiplet shaped by coupling with CH3 (quartet) and CH (doublet), resulting in a "doublet of quartets" (if the J values are significantly different, otherwise if two J couplings are similar, this could make a quintet).

3. The CH groups attached to carbon atoms labeled as CH and bonded to a CH3 group and a CH2 group on one CH carbon and a carboxylic acid on the other CH carbon:
    - CH part on carbon 3: This proton is connected to three other groups: CH2 (two protons), CH3 (assuming one methyl group), and another CH (which contains one proton).
        - Coupling with CH2 (2 protons) → triplet (n=2).
        - Coupling with CH3 (3 protons) → quartet splitting could be negligible here because CH3 itself appears as a doublet due to coupling solely with the single proton on carbon 3.
        - Coupling with CH part on carbon 4 (1 proton) → doublet (n=1).
        - Total splitting might be a "doublet of triplets" or a "doublet of quartets" for the proton on carbon 3 if the CH and CH2 couplings are considered distinctly if different J values are utilized.

4. Second CH part on carbon 4:
    - Similarly, the proton here is connected to CH(CH3) (which contains one proton yielding a doublet), another CH3 (3 protons yielding a quartet), and the COOH group (which typically appears as a broad singlet due to proton exchange and does not usually cause splitting for adjacent proton signals unless explicitly mentioned).
    - CH on carbon 4: split by CH3 (3 protons) → triplet would originate from a CH2, but here should be a quartet.
        - Coupling with CH part on carbon 3 (1 proton) → doublet (n=1).
        - Total splitting might be a "doublet of quartets" for the proton on carbon 4.

The question states that one signal is a "doublet of triplets of quartets" and another signal is a "doublet of triplets of triplets." 

However, for a "doublet of triplets of quartets":
1. A "doublet of triplets of quartets" comes from a proton that couples to one other proton (doublet component), two other protons (triplet component), and three other protons (quartet component):
    
To identify which one of the given compounds might fulfill such a description, let us analyze the second compound: CH3CH2CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)COOH.

#### For the second compound, CH3CH2CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)COOH:
This compound is:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-\overset{H}{\underset{C_2H_5}{\overset{|}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{C}}}}}-\overset{H}{\underset{C_2H_5}{\overset{|}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{C}}}}-COOH}}.
$$
Let us decompose the "ethyl" groups (C2H5 includes a-CH2CH3 part where the CH2 part itself has two hydrogens that could couple to the rest of the compound structure):
1. CH3-CH2- group could be split as previously noted:
    - First CH3 could be a triplet due to coupling with CH2.
    
2. CH3-CH2-CH(C2H5):
    - The CH2 group here could be split by the first CH3 group (giving a quartet pattern) and also by the CH group which has one proton (another doublet), thus making another "doublet of quartets" if J values are sufficiently different.
    
3. For the asymmetric carbon atoms such as "-CH(C2H5)":
    - The proton on the CH part could interact with several groups:
        - The ethyl group has a CH2 (2 protons → triplet) and another CH3 (3 protons which might appear as a doublet, but actually that CH3 should primarily interact with the CH2 group where it appears as a triplet for the CH3 group).
        - Furthermore, coupling with the adjacent CH2 group might contribute yet another triplet splitting due to two protons.
        - Additionally, the adjacent CH group (1 proton) would give a doublet splitting.
    
Let us focus systematically on the splitting for CH3CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. For CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5), let us analyze the CH part (let us denote the hydrogens explicitly as such:
$$
\ce{CH3}- \ce{CH2}-\underset{H}{\underset{|}{\ce{C}}}\ce{(CH2-CH3)}-\underset{H}{\underset{|}{\ce{C}}}\ce{(CH2-CH3)}-\ce{COOH}.
$$
The first part labeled as CH3-CH2 has:
1. The CH3 (let us call it Ha) is split by the CH2 into a triplet.
2. The CH2 group (let us call it Hb) has potential splittings from:
    - Adjacent CH3 → quartet.
    - Adjacent CH group → doublet, so could be split complexly such as a "doublet of quartets" or might appear merged into quintet if J values are similar.

The central CH groups labeled as such might have complex splittings given by:
1. The proton on one CH group (let us call it Hc):
    - Coupled to the adjacent CH2 group (2 protons) yielding a triplet.
    - Coupled to the CH2 part of the C2H5 group (2 protons) yielding another triplet.
    - Coupled to the only proton on the adjacent CH(C2H5) group yielding a doublet.
    Therefore, this might make a "doublet of triplets of triplets" for one proton on one of the CH groups where another CH coupling is a doublet (1 proton splitting), CH2 part splitting gives a triplet (2 protons), and another triplet from another adjacent CH2 part.

2. Another part might be similar for the other CH group (let us call it Hd), likewise presenting splittings such that:
    - The coupling should be similar yet the question mentions that another signal should be a "doublet of triplets of quartets." However, the difference lies likely in coupling with the COOH group which could sometimes interact as a broad singlet due to exchange processes, but here we need a "quartet" part in the splitting pattern.
    
So far, the structure described by CH3CH2CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)COOH seems close to having a "doublet of triplets of triplets" due to coupling patterns such as:
1. By the CH2CH3 group (2 protons -> triplet).
2. By the neighboring CH2 group (2 protons -> triplet).
3. By the neighboring CH proton (1 proton -> doublet).

However, a "doublet of triplets of quartets" might require coupling to three protons (quartet part). The question mentions one signal needs a "doublet of triplets of quartets" splitting pattern where:
1. One proton gives rise to a doublet (n=1).
2. Two protons give rise to a triplet (n=2).
3. Three protons give rise to a quartet (n=3).
    
To make a quartet splitting, a coupling by a CH3 group should typically produce a quartet (if the coupling is with adjacent CH3 group protons).

However, the additional quartets might be a "misrepresentation"; another candidate might be worth checking explicitly.

#### For the third compound, CH3CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2COOH:
This breaks down to:
$$
\mathrm{H_3C-\overset{H}{\underset{CH_3}{\overset{|}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{C}}}}}-\overset{H}{\underset{CH_3}{\overset{|}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{C}}}}-CH_2-COOH}}.
$$
Let us identify analogous splittings here:
1. The first CH3 group labeled as "CH3-CH(CH3)":
    - This proton should couple primarily to the neighboring CH group which has one proton resulting in a doublet.
    - However, typically, a methyl group should split another group's signal into a quartet if it itself is a triplet (which means another adjacent carbon).
    
2. The CH group labeled as "CH3-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)":
    - Coupling pattern for the first CH group might be:
        - CH3 (3 protons) → quartet.
        - Neighboring CH group (1 proton) → doublet.
        - Another CH3 group might be too far from another neighboring CH group for splitting (as we need only one neighbor coupling).
    
3. Another CH group labeled as "CH3CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2":
    - Similar splitting patter needs CH3 (3 protons) → quartet.
        - CH group (1 proton) → doublet.
        - CH2 group → triplet.
    
4. The CH2 group on CH(CH3)CH2-COOH might be split by:
    - CH groups (1 proton) → doublet.
    - COOH might usually appear as a singlet so this group itself does not typically split the CH2, rather it might appear as a triplet due to coupling solely with CH group.

So among the given choices, the splitting patterns might be a "doublet of triplets of triplets" seems less likely here because the CH groups mainly appear connected to CH3 (which gives a coupling of a doublet), another CH group (again a doublet), and a CH2 group might make a triplet, whereas a "doublet of triplets of quartets" should feature a coupling with three neighbors (as a quartet).

#### For the fourth compound, CH3CH(C2H5)CH(C2H5)CH2COOH:
This compound breaks down to:
$$
\mathrm{H_3C-\overset{H}{\underset{C_2H_5}{\overset{|}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{C}}}}}-\overset{H}{\underset{C_2H_5}{\overset{|}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{C}}}}-CH_2-COOH}}.\\
$$
1. The methyl group attached to the first carbon splits as follows:
    - The CH3 should be split by the CH group (1 proton splitting CH3 into a doublet).
    
2. For the first CH group here connected to a C2H5 group:
    - The CH group should split by CH3 (3H group makes a quartet).
    - Another neighbor CH2 of C2H5 (2H group makes a triplet).
    - The second CH group (1 proton makes a doublet).
    
3. The second CH group:
    - Splits with CH2 group (2H makes triplet).
    - C2H5 group again contains a CH2 part coupling as a triplet made from 2H.
    - First CH group (1 proton makes a doublet).

4. Finally, the CH2 group:
    - Splits by CH group (1H makes a doublet).
    - Splits by COOH which would make a triplet if COOH did not appear primarily as a broad singlet.

By breaking down the CH3CH2 part here, the CH3 splits into a doublet from CH (1 proton) and a triplet from CH3CH2 (3 protons). However, the question mentions that one signal is a "doublet of triplets of quartets" thus:
Another signal needs a "doublet of triplets of triplets" seems only partially matching here.

Based on the FTIR analysis, all four compounds contain a carboxylic acid (COOH group), which explains the two main IR peaks mentioned:
1. Broad peaks at 3000 cm⁻¹ for the O-H stretch.
2. Strong peak at 1700 cm⁻1 for the C=O stretch.

However, the 1H NMR part requires a "doublet of triplets of quartets" and a "doublet of triplets of triplets" splitting pattern. 

However, we need a signal split into quartets (coupling with three protons). However, a "doublet of triplets of triplets" which results from a primary splitting into a doublet (1 neighbor), with a triplet (2 neighbors), and another triplet (2 neighbors again) fits well only for compounds where a CH group is surrounded by a CH2 group (for the triplet) and another CH group (doublet) parts. 

Let us now make a more systematic NMR splitting analysis carefully for CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH which could be explicitly named as follows:

1. Split CH3CH2 part:
    - First CH3 is adjacent to a CH2(2H): splits into a triplet (n=2).
    
2. Second part CH2 group would be adjacent to a CH3 (3H) and a CH (1H).
    - Expected splitting as a quartet (CH3) and a doublet (CH).
    - Thus yielding a "doublet of quartets" if coupling constants are sufficiently different.

3. First CH(CH3) group:
    - The proton on this carbon couples to the CH2 (2 protons) → triplet.
    - CH3 (3 protons) → triplet part seems odd because that makes a quartet.
    - Another CH group (1 proton) → doublet.
    - Resulting in a "doublet of triplets of quartets" here seems a bit off due to a quartets split being from CH3 which actually makes a quartet itself only for the methyl group.

Therefore, analyze the CH3
