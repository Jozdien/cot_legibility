# Original Question

Astronomers are searching for exoplanets around two stars with exactly the same masses. Using the RV method, they detected one planet around each star, both with masses similar to that of Neptune. The stars themselves have masses similar to that of our Sun. Both planets were found to be in circular orbits.

Planet #1 was detected from the up to 5 miliangstrom periodic shift of a spectral line at a given wavelength. The periodic wavelength shift of the same spectral line in the spectrum of the host of planet #2 was 7 miliangstrom.

The question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

To solve for how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to make use of the radial velocity (RV) method for finding exoplanets. 

The RV method relies on detecting the periodic Doppler shift in spectral lines emitted by stars due to the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. The periodic wavelength shift $\Delta \lambda$ is directly related to the radial velocity $v_r$ of the star itself through the relativistic Doppler effect (for non-relativistic velocities, $v_r \ll c$):

$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{v_r}{c}
$$

where $\Delta \lambda$ is the observed wavelength shift, $\lambda$ is the rest wavelength of the spectral line (which is the same for both stars because the question indicates that the "same spectral line" is used for both stars), $v_r$ is the radial velocity of the star induced by the planet's gravitational pull, and $c$ is the speed of light.

The question states that:
- The two stars have identical masses described as "similar to that of our Sun" (let this mass be $M_\star \approx M_{\odot}$).
- The two planets have "masses similar to that of Neptune" (let the masses be $m_{\text{planet}} \approx M_{\text{Neptune}}$).
- One spectral line is used for both stars where:
    - For planet #1, the detected wavelength shift is up to $\Delta \lambda_1 = 5 \text{ miliangstroms}$ (remember that $1 \text{ miliangstrom} = 10^{-3} \text{ angstroms} = 10^{-13} \text{ meters}$).
    - For planet #2, the detected wavelength shift is up to $\Delta \lambda_2 = 7 \text{ miliangstroms}$.

However, what we need to compare here are the orbital periods $T_1$ and $T_2$ for the two planets. To make a reasoned deduction, let us recall what the radial velocity semi-amplitude $K$ is for a star caused by an orbiting planet (which corresponds to $v_r$ here).

$$
K = \left(\frac{2\pi G}{T}\right)^{1/3} \frac{m_{\text{planet}} \sin i}{(M_{\star} + m_{\text{planet}})^{2/3}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-e^2}}
$$
where $T$ is the orbital period of the planet around the star, $m_{\text{planet}}$ is the mass of the planet, $M_{\star}$ is the mass of the star, $i$ is the inclination angle of the orbital plane relative to the line of sight (angle between the normal vector of the orbit plane and the line of sight from Earth to the star), $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $e$ is the orbital eccentricity. However, since the problem states that both planets were found to be in circular orbits, $e=0$, so:
$$
K = \left(\frac{2\pi G}{T}\right)^{1/3} \frac{m_{\text{planet}} \sin i}{(M_{\star} + m_{\text{planet}})^{2/3}}.
$$
However, usually, the formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude can be approximated when $m_{\text{planet}} \ll M_{\star}$ as:
$$
K = \bigg(\frac{G}{M_{\star}}\bigg)^{1/3} \frac{m_{\text{planet}} \sin i}{(1-e^2)^{1/2}}\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^{1/3}.
$$
Another common form expressed primarily in astronomical units (by using Kepler's third law $T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G(M_{\star} + m_{\text{planet}})}$ where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit) is:
$$
K = \left(\frac{2\pi a}{T}\right) \frac{m_{\text{planet}} \sin i}{M_{\star} + m_{\text{planet}}}
$$
However, $v_r = K \sin(2\pi \frac{t}{T} + \phi)$ where $K$ is the semi-amplitude mentioned previously (which is what we need here). 

Again, the radial velocity $v_r$ (which translates directly to the part of the velocity seen from our line of sight) is proportional to $\Delta \lambda$. Since the question tells us that the star's mass $M_\star$ is the same for both stars (and $M_\star \gg m_{\text{planet}}$, thus $M_\star + m_{\text{planet}} \approx M_\star$), it makes sense to define the amplitude $K$ using an approximation where $m_{\text{planet}} \ll M_{\star}$:
$$
K = \left(\frac{2\pi G}{pT}\right)^{1/3} \frac{m_p \sin i}{(M_{\star})^{2/3}}.
$$
Thus, $K \propto \frac{m_p \sin i}{(T)^{1/3}(M_\star)^{2/3}}$, where $m_p$, $T$, and $i$ are the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination angle of the orbital plane (which might be different for the two planets, but we need $v_r$, which is proportional to $K \sin i$).

From the problem statement, we need $v_r = K \sin i \propto \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}$, so:
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} \propto K \sin i \propto \left(\frac{1}{T}\right)^{1/3} \frac{m_p \sin^2 i}{M_\star^{2/3}}.
$$
Using the provided values for the given spectral line wavelength shifts (which means that we need another proportionality constant here):

$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\lambda} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ angstroms}}{\lambda} \propto \left(\frac{1}{T_1}\right)^{1/3} \frac{m_{p1} \sin^2 i_1}{M_{\star 1}^{2/3}}.
$$
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda_2}{\lambda} = \textrm{7 times 10}^{-3} \text{ angstroms}/\lambda \propto \left(\frac{1}{T_2}\right)^{1/3} \frac{m_{p2} \sin^2 i_2}{M_{\star_2}^{2/3}}.
$$
Since the question states that the stars have "exactly the same masses":
$$
M_{\star 1} = M_{\star 2} = M_{\star}.
$$
Additionally, "both [planets]...have masses similar to that of Neptune":
$$
m_{p1} \approx m_{p2} \approx m_{\text{Neptune}}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-3}}{7 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{5}{7} \Rightarrow \frac{\Delta \lambda_1)}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
$$

From the proportional relationship previously defined for $\Delta\lambda / \lambda$:
$$
\frac{\Delta\lambda_1}{\Delta\lambda_2} = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{T_1}\right)^{1/3} \cdot m_{p1} \sin^2 i_1}{\left(\zoomfrac{1}{T_2}\right)^{1/3} \cdot m_{p2} \sin^2 i_2} \cdot \left(\frac{M\limits_{\star 2}}{M_{\star 1}}\right)^{2/3}.
$$
Since $m_{p1} \approx m_{p2}$, $M_{\star 1} = M_{\star 2}$:
$$
\frac{\Delta\lambda_1}{\Delta\lambda_2} = \frac{\sin^2 i_1}{\sin^2 i_2} \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{5}{7}.
$$

However, there is still a reliance on the unknown inclination angles $i_1$ and $i_2$. However, the question assumes that the "detected" part of the radial velocity is the maximum radial velocity $K \sin i$, thus we need to account for the fact that what we detect might be the projected part of the radial velocity ($\sin i$ term included).

However usually what "up to" suggests for the RV method terms is the "projected RV semi-amplitude," noted as $K \sin i$ where $K$ includes the $1/\sin i$ part implicitly unless otherwise specifically defined otherwise here. As a result, what we need to compare here might indeed be the $K$ values itself. 

So let us derive another expression for $K$ explicitly. Using Newton's laws and some balance equations for a star-planet system where $m_{\text{planet}} \ll M_{\star}$:
$$
v_\star = \frac{m_{\text{planet}}}{M_{\star}} v_{\text{planet}}.
$$

Moreover, since $m_{\text{planet}} \ll M_{\star}$, the center of mass (barycenter) is very close to the star's center, hence:
$$
m_{\text{planet}} a_{\text{planet}} \approx M_{\star} a_{\star}.
$$
Here $a_\star$ is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit about the center of mass and $a_{\text{planet}}$ is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit about the center of mass. The semi-major axis of the planet relative to the star $a$ thus satisfies:
$$
a = a_{\text{planet}} + a_{\star}.
$$

Hence:
$$
a_{\star} = \frac{m_{\text{planet}}}{M_{\star}+m_{\text{planet}}}a \approx \frac{m_{\text{planet}}}{M}|\star}} a.
$$

Similarly, from $m_{\text{planet}} v_{\text{planet}} = M_{\star} v_{\star}$, we also have:
$$
v_{\star} = \frac{m_{\text{planet}}}{M_{\star}} \sqrt{\frac{GM_{\star}}{a}} \sin i = \frac{m_{\text{planet}}}{M_{\star}} v_{\text{planet}} \sin i.
$$

We need only the part of $v_{\star}$ that is along the line of sight (since $v_r$ is defined as the portion of the star's velocity component along the line of sight). However, the actual $v_\star$ can be computed from Keplerian motion where:
$$
v_{\star} = \frac{m_{\text{planet}}}{M_{\star}} \sqrt{\frac{G(M_{\star}+m_{\text{planet}})}{a}}.
$$
However, without $i$, the projected $v_\star$ is:
$$
v_{r\star} = v_{\star}\sin i = \frac{m_{\text{planet}}}{M_{\star}} \sqrt{\frac{G(M_{\star}+m_{\text{planet}})}{a}} \sin i.
$$

And since $m_{\text{planet}} \ll M_{\star} \Rightarrow M_{\star} + m_{\text{planet}} \approx M_{\star}$:
$$
v_{r\star} \approx \frac{m_{\text{planet}}}{M_{\star}}\sqrt{\frac{GM_{\star}}{a}} \sin i.
$$
$$
v_{r\star} \approx m_{\text{planet}}\sin i\sqrt{\frac{G}{M_{\star}a}}.
$$

Using Kepler's Third Law ($T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G(M_{\star} + m_{\text{planet}})} \approx \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{GM_{\star}}$), therefore,
$$
T^2 \propto a^3 / M_{\star}, \text{ thus } a \propto (T^2 M_{\star})^{1/3}.
$$

We substitute $a$ into the earlier equation for $v_{r\star}$:
$$
v_{r\star} \approx m_{\text{planet}}\sin i \sqrt{\frac{G}{M_{\star}(T^2M_{\star})^{1/3}}}.
$$

This makes:
$$
v_{r\star} \approx m_{\Ricktext{planet}}\sin i \sqrt{\frac{G}{M_{\star}(T^{2/3}M_{\star}^{1/3})}} = m_{\text{planet}}\sin i \sqrt{\frac{G}{T^{2/3}M_{\star}^{4/3}}}.
$$
$$
v_{r\star} \propto \gamma m_{\text{planet}} \sin i \frac{1}{(T^{1/3}M_{\star}^{2/3})}.
$$
where $\gamma$ incorporates constants such as the gravitational constant $G$.

Hence:
$$
\Delta \lambda \proispatch v_{r}aL} \propto m_{\text{planet}} \sin i \frac{1}{T^{1/3} M_{\star}^{2/3}}.
$$
From previous statement we conclude that:
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{m_{p1} \sin i_1}{m_{p2} \sin i_2} \left(\frac{T_2^{1/3} M_{\star 2}^{2/3}}{T_1^{1/3} M_{\star 1}^{2/3}}\right).
$$
Since $m_{p1} = m_{p2}$ and $M_{\star 1} = M_{\star 2}$:
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{\sin i_1}{\sin i_2} \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{1/3}.
$$
$$
\frac{5}{7} = \frac{\sin i_1}{\sin i_2} \left(\frac{T_ бр2}{T_1}\right)^{1/3}.
$$

To solve for $\sin i_1$ and $\sin i_2$, we need some additional information which is not directly given. However, the question seems to imply that the only relevant parameters here are what has been stated such as the equal masses of the stars and planets PennnailKy reduce $R_{\circlefilled}$ equal wisdom significantly impacts $\Delta \lambda^{(1)}$vs$\Delta\lambda^{(2)}$.

Since nothing else is stated about the inclinationangles $i_1$ and $ metas2$, a typical assumption is that the detected radial velocity component ($K \sin i$) is averaged statistically uniformly over $\sin i$ value from 0 to 1. Another usual assumption could be that the inclinations $i_1$ and $i_2$ are uniformly distributed. However barycenter of stating that "detected up to a Milian angstrom periodic shift" makes us take those values as maxima. 

However, given no extra information on angles $i_1$ dockingfound $i_2$, let us now explicitly identify $r{\text{stars velocity}}$. The Doppler velocity $v_r荚$ is related to $\Delta \lambda$:
