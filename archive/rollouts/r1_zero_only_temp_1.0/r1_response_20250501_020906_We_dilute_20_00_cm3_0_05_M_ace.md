# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

To solve for the pH values when 25% of the acetic acid has been titrated with NaOH and when it reaches the equivalence point, we need to first understand what happens when we dilute 20.00 cm³ of a 0.05 M acetic acid solution with 20.00 cm³ of water.

#### Step 1: Initial dilution of acetic acid

The initial volume of acetic acid solution is 20.00 cm³ (which is equivalent to 20.00 mL or 0.02000 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. When we add 20.00 cm³ of water to it, the total volume becomes:

$$
20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
$$

Since the volume is doubled (from 20.00 cm³ to 40.00 cm³), the concentration of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) can be calculated thus:

$$
\text{Initial moles of acetic acid}= (0.05 \, \text{M}) \times (20.00 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{L}) = 0.05 \times 0.020 = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
$$
Total volume after dilution is:
$$
(20 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20 \, \text{cm}^3) \times 10^{-3} \, \text{L/cm}^3 = 0.040 \, \text{L}.
$$
$$
\text{New concentration of CH₃COOH}= \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.040 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
$$

#### Step 2: Titration with 0.1 M NaOH

Our task now is to titrate the diluted solution (which now contains 0.001 moles of CH₃COOH in a volume of 0.040 L) with a 0.1 M NaOH solution. The reaction that occurs is:

$$
\text{CH₃COOH} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{Na⁺} + \text{H₂O}.
$$
This reaction shows that acetic acid reacts with sodium hydroxide in a 1:1 molar ratio.

##### Step 2.1: Volume of NaOH needed for the titration to reach the equivalence point

At the equivalence point, the stoichiometric amounts of acetic acid and NaOH react completely. Recall that the initial moles of acetic acid are:
$$
0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.020 \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
$$
To completely neutralize these 0.001 moles of acetic acid, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH (given that the reaction is 1:1).
Using the given concentration of the NaOH solution (0.1 M), the volume of NaOH required for the equivalence point can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Moles of NaOH needed} = 0.001 \, \text{moles},
$$
$$
\text{Volume of NaOH needed} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.010 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
$$

##### Step 3: pH at 25% titration

When 25% of the acetic acid is titrated, it means that 25% of the original 0.001 moles of acetic acid have been reacted with NaOH:
$$
0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{moles} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
$$
This means that 0.00025 moles of NaOH are needed to titrate 25% of the acetic acid. To compute the volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed for this:
$$
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.00025 \, \text{moles}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.1} = 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 2.5 \, \text{mL}.
$$
The reaction produces 0.00025 moles of CH₃COO⁻ while the remaining moles of CH₃COOH are:
$$
0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
$$
Total volume of solution now is:
$$
40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
$$
However, what matters here is not just the total volume, but the concentrations of CH₃COOH and CH₃COO⁻ formed:

$$
\text{Concentration of CH₃COOH after 25% titration} = \frac{0.00075 \, \text{moles}}{0.0425 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}.
$$
$$
\text{Concentration of CH₃COO⁻ after 25% titration} = \frac{0.00025 \, \text{moles}}{0.0425 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
$$
This is a buffer solution composed of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and its conjugate base (CH₃COO⁻). To find the pH of a buffer solution, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
$$
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left ( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right ).
$$
First, calculate the pKa from the given Ka value:
$$
\text{pKa} = -\log (\text{Ka}) = -\log (1.85 \times 10^{-5}).
$$
$$
\log (1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx \log 1.85 + \log (10^{-5}) \approx \log 1.85 - 5.
$$
$$
\text{(since }\log\quad1.85 \simeq \log 1.85 \approx 0.267)
$$
$$
\rightarrow \log (1.85) \approx 0.2672,
$$
$$
\log (1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 0.2672 -  \log (10^5) \approx 0.2672 - 5,
$$
$$
\text{pKa} = - (\log 1.85 + \log 10^{-5}) = - (0.2672 - 5) = -0.2672 + 5 = 4.7328.
$$
Now, calculate the pH:
$$
\text{pH} = 4.7328 + \log \left ( \frac{0.00025 / 0.0425}{0.00075 / 0.0425} \right ) = 4.7328 + \log \left ( \frac{0.00025}{0.00075} \right ).
$$
$$
= 4.7328 + \log \left (\frac{0.00025}{0.00075} \right ) = 4.7328 + \log \left ( \frac{25}{75} \right ) = 4.7328 + \log \left ( \frac{1}{3} \right ).
$$
$$
= 4.7328 + \log (1) - \log (3) = 4.7328 + 0 - \log (3).
$$
$$
\text{(since } \log 3 \approx 0.4771\text{)}:
$$
$$
\rightarrow \text{pH} = 4.7328 - 0.4771 = 4.2557 \approx 4.26.
$$

#### Step 4: pH at the equivalence point

At the equivalence point (which we determined requires 10.00 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH added), all of the 0.001 moles of CH₃COOH will be converted to acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻):
$$
\Rightarrow 0.001 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH} \rightarrow 0.001 \, \text{moles of CH₃COO}.
$$
Total volume at the equivalence point is:
$$
40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05000 \, \text{L}.
$$
The concentration of CH₃COO⁻ can be calculated as:
$$
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.05000 \, \text{L}} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
$$
This acetate ion hydrolyzes in water according to the reaction:
$$
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻},
$$
with a hydrolysis constant $K_b$ which we need to find. Given that:
$$
K_a \times K_b = K_w.
$$
Where $ K_w $ is the ion-product constant for water at 25 °C ($1.0 \times 10^{-14}$):
$$
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10}.
$$
This $K_b$ represents the reaction:
$$
\text{CH₃COO^-} + \text{H₂O} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
$$
Let $x$ be the concentration of the OH⁻ ions formed due to the hydrolysis of CH₃COO⁻. The initial concentrations are:
$$
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = 0.020\, \text{M} \text{ (initial concentration of acetate ions)}.
$$
$$
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = 0,
$$
$$
[\text{OH⁻}] = 0.
$$
Change in concentrations at equilibrium:
$$\text{CH₃COO⁻ decreases by $x$, CH₃COOH increases by $x$, and OH⁻ increases by $x$}:$$
$$
[\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = 0.020 - x,
$$
$$
[\text{CH₃COOH}] = x,
$$
$$
[\text{OH⁻}] = x.
$$
The $K_b$ expression for the reaction is:
$$
K_b = \frac{[\text{CH₃COOH}] [\text{OH⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]} = \frac{x \cdot x}{0.020 - x} = \frac{x^2}{0.020 - x}.
$$
Because $K_b$ is very small ($5.41 \times 10^{-10}$), we assume that $x \ll 0.020$, so $0.020 - x \approx 0.020$:
$$\frac{x^2}{0.020} = 5.41 \times 10^{-10},$$
$$
x^2 = 0.020 \times 5.41 \times 10^{-10} = 1.082 \times 10^{-11},
$$
$$
x = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6}.
$$
This $x$ represents the concentration of OH⁻ ions:
$$
\text{[OH⁻]} = 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \text{ M}.
$$
$$
\text{pOH} = -\log ([\text{OH⁻}]) = -\log (3.29 \times 10^{-6}),
$$
$$
\approx -\log 3.29 - \log 10^{-6}=-\log 3.29 + 6.
$$
$$
\text{(since } \log 3.29 \approx 0.5172\text{)}:
$$
$$
\text{pOH} \approx -0.5172 + 6 = 5.4828.
$$
$$
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.4828 = 8.5172 \approx 8.52.
$$
Thus, the pH values are approximately:
$$
\text{pH at 25% titration: } \boxed{4.26} \text{ (rounded to two decimal places)}.
$$
$$
\text{pH at equivalence point: } \boxed{8.52} \text{ (rounded to two decimal places)}.
$$
However, it makes sense to verify the answer for the part where $x \ll 0.020$ assumption was made. The initial assumption was that $0.020 - x \approx 0.020$. Since:
$$
x = 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \text{ M}.
$$
Clearly, $3.29 \times 10^{-6} \ll 0.020$, so our assumption is valid. 

Hence, the reasoning seems reasonable and verified. Thus, the pH should be computed accurately here.

#### Verification via another way to solve directly using the $[\text{OH⁻}]$ formula for a salt of a weak acid:

$\text{[OH⁻]} = \sqrt{[CH₃COO⁻] \times K_b}$
$$
[\text{OH⁻}] = \sqrt{0.020 \times 5.41 \times ^{10^{-10}}} = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \text{ M}.
$$
So our previous calculations appear to be consistent.
