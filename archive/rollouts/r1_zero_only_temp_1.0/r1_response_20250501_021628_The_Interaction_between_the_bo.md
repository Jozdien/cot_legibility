# Original Question

The Interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by

\mathcal{L}\left(y\right)=-\lambda{f}\bar{\psi}{f}\left(y\right)\left(\upsilon+X\left(y\right)\right)\psi_{f}\left(y\right)

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV.
What are the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order?

\boxed{
The kinematically allowed decays of the $6$ GeV $X$ boson could be decays into fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion has a mass less than $3$ GeV. Therefore, kinematically allowed decays include:
$$
X \rightarrow u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, \nu_e\bar{\nu_e}, \nu_\mu\bar{\nu_\mu}, \text{ and } \nu_\tau\bar{\nu_\tau}.
$$
However, such kinematical arguments only ensure conservation of energy and momentum. Therefore, the decays $X \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ and $X \rightarrow t\bar{t}$ are not kinematically allowed due to the sum of the masses of $b$ quarks exceeding the boson $X$ mass of $6$ GeV and the $t$ quark mass already being $173$ GeV.

To analyze the kinematically allowed decays of the boson $X$ given the interaction Lagrangian:

$$
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
$$

we need to expand and interpret the given Lagrangian. First, notice that $\psi_f(y)$ represents a fermion field labeled by flavor $f$, $\bar{\psi}_f(y)$ is the Dirac adjoint of the fermion field, $X(y)$ is a bosonic field which has a mass of $6$ GeV, and $\upsilon$ is a constant (which possibly represents another field's vacuum expectation value). However, $\upsilon$ appears as a constant term in the Lagrangian.

The given interaction Lagrangian can be expanded as:
$$
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \upsilon \psi_f(y) - \lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) X(y) \psi_f(y).
$$
The first term $-\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \upsilon \psi_f(y)$ interacts only with the fermion field $\psi_f$, contributing a term like $-\lambda_f \upsilon \bar{\psi}_f(y) \psi_f(y)$ which is a fermion mass term where:
$$
m_f = \lambda_f \upsilon.
$$
This implies that the fermion gets a mass $m_f$ proportional to the constant $\upsilon$ and the coupling $\lambda_f$.

The second term $- \lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) X(y) \psi_f(y)$ describes a three-point vertex where a boson $X$ interacts with a fermion $-\psi_f$ and its antiparticle $\bar{\psi}_f$. This term shows an interaction vertex where $X$ can decay into a pair of fermion and antifermion $f\bar{f}$ (assuming that such a decay is kinematically allowed). 

However, $X$ decays through the term $ \lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) X(y) \psi_f(y)$. Thus, the simplest decay process at the lowest order diagram would be:
$$
X \rightarrow \bar{f}f,
$$
where $f$ is any fermion for which such a term is present in the Lagrangian. 

To check whether such a decay is kinematically allowed, the mass of the $X$ boson should be sufficient to produce a pair of fermions $\bar{f}f$. Thus, $m_X \geq 2 m_f$. 

Given that the mass of the boson $X$ is $6$ GeV, the kinematically allowed decays into fermion-antifermion pairs should satisfy:
$$
6\text{ GeV} \geq 2m_f,
$$
which simplifies to:
$$
m_f \leq 3\text{ GeV}.
$$
Thus, any fermion $f$ whose mass $m_f \leq 3$ GeV could make the decay $X \rightarrow \bar{f} f$ kinematically allowed, so long as it couples to $X$ through the given interaction Lagrangian.

Based on real-world particle masses:
- The top quark has a mass around $173$ GeV (thus $m_t \gg 3\text{ GeV}$, so $X \rightarrow t\bar{t}$ is not kinematically allowed).
- The bottom quark has a mass around $4.18$ GeV (which is larger than $3\text{ GeV}$, so $X \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ could be close to the kinematic threshold but seems unlikely if we strictly interpret $m_X = 6\text{ GeV}$ and $2m_b \approx 8.36 \text{ GeV}$).
- The charm quark has a mass around $1.28$ GeV (thus $2m_c \approx 2.56\text{ GeV}$, so $X \rightarrow c\overline{c}$ is kinematically allowed).
- The strange quark has a mass around $95$ MeV (thus $2m_s \approx 0.19\text{ GeV}$, so $X \rightarrow s\overline{s}$ is kinematically allowed).
- The up and down quarks typically have masses on the order of a few MeV (thus $2m_u \geq 4\text{ MeV}$ and $2m_d \geq 9\text{ MeV}$, so $X \rightarrow u\bar{u}$ and $X \rightarrow d\bar{d}$ are also kinematically allowed).
- Regarding leptons:
    - The tau lepton has a mass of approximately $1.777$ GeV (thus $2m_\tau \approx 3.554\text{ GeV}$, so $X \rightarrow \tau\bar{\tau}$ appears to be barely kinematically allowed).
    - The muon has a mass of approximately $0.105$ GeV (thus $2m_\mu \approx 0.211 \text{ GeV}$, so $X \rightarrow \mu\bar{\mu}$ is kinematically allowed).
    - The electron has a mass of approximately $0.511$ MeV (thus $2m_e \approx 1.022\text{ MeV}$, so $X \rightarrow e\bar{e}$ is kinematically allowed).

However, we need verification on whether any neutrinos are kinematically allowed. Neutrinos have very small masses (typically less than an eV), so decays like $X \rightarrow \bar{\nu}\nu$ are kinematically allowed as well. However, neutrino interactions are usually included explicitly in the Lagrangian if they are relevant here. 

Based on the interaction term $\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)$, if $\psi_f$ includes neutrinos ($\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau$), the decay might be:
$$
X \rightarrow \bar{\nu} \nu
$$
However, such a channel might be difficult to detect due to the neutrino's weak interactions and small mass.

However, to make a comprehensive answer based on the question statement, it seems that all fermions satisfying $2m_f \leq 6 \text{ GeV}$ may be candidates for $X$ decays. Thus, for fermions such that $m_f \leq 3$ GeV, the decay $X \rightarrow \bar{f}f$ should be kinematically allowed where $f$ could be any quark other than the top quark and bottom quark seems close to the threshold (so one should verify if $m_b < 3\text{ GeV}$, but it seems that bottom quark is indeed not kinematically allowed based on a mass of $4.18$ GeV).

However, a logical check here might indicate that any quark-antiquark pair that makes $2m_{f} < m_X$ should be kinematically allowed until $f$ is such that $2m_f < 6\text{ GeV}$, which leads us to:
#### Given the question states $m_X = 6$ GeV, kinematically allowed decays could be:
$$
X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, \text{ and possibly } \nu_\mathrm{e} \bar{\nu}_\mathrm{e}, \nu_\mu \bar{\nu}_\mu, \nu_\tau \bar{\nu}_\tau,
$$
where $b\bar{b}$ is not clearly kinematically allowed because $2m_b \approx 8.36 \text{ GeV}$, which is larger than the $6$ GeV mass of $X$. 

However, due to the question's wording, we need to make a clear list of the main candidates where $2m_f < m_X$. Since $m_b \approx 4.18 \text{ GeV}$:
$$
\text{mass of $b$ quark} \times 2 = 8.36 \text{ GeV} > 6\text{ GeV}.
$$
Hence, decay into $b\bar{b}$ pairs is not kinematically allowed for a $6$ GeV $X$ boson.

Thus, what remains is:
$$
X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s} , u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-.
$$
However, one should verify that the question implies any fermion flavor should theoretically be included unless it is specifically mentioned that there are only certain flavors. So unless specified otherwise, any fermion where $\bar{\psi}_f \psi_f$ makes sense could be a candidate here.

Based on conservation laws such as charge conservation or others, the only allowed decays involving fermions should be into fermion-antifermion pairs such that:
1. $f\bar{f}$ pairs where $f$ is a quark or a charged lepton where the sum of the masses for fermion and antifermion should be less than or equal to $6\text{ GeV}$.
2. Neutral lepton pairs such as $\bar{\nu}\nu$, which should always be allowed kinematically given neutrinos have such small masses.

However, there is still a point here where $b\bar{b}$ seems slightly off the edge; hence verifying if there's a $3$ GeV fermion limit makes sense. Another important point here is that only the fermion flavors $\psi_f$ that are part of the interaction Lagrangian would be relevant for decays. Thus, the question requires us to identify which fermion pairs are allowed kinematically such that $m_f < \frac{m_X}{2} = 3 \text{ GeV}$. 

Based on standard model fermions (excluding top and bottom quarks whose combined mass is larger than $6 \text{ GeV}$), possible decays are:
1. $X \to u \bar{u}$
2. $X \to d \bar{d}$
3. $X \to c \bar{c}$
4. $X \to s \bar{s}$
5. $X \to e^+ e^-$
6. $X \to \mu^+ \mu^-$
7. $X \to \tau^+ \tau^-$
8. $X \to \nu\bar{\nu}$ decays where $\nu$ represents any neutrino flavor ($\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, or $\nu_\tau$). 

However, broad quantum numbers such as charge should be conserved thus always pairing a fermion with its antiparticle.

Based on the question statement, the kinematically allowed decays could thus be summarized as:
$$
\text{X can decay at the lowest order into fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than $3$ GeV}.
$$
However, the main candidates based on usual fermion masses:
$$
X \to e^+ e^-,\ \mu^+ \mu^-,\ \tau^+ \tau^-,\ \nu_e\bar{\nu_e},\ \nu_\mu\bar{\nu_\mu},\ \nu_\tau \bar{\nu_\tau},\ u\bar{u},\ d\bar{d},\ s\bar{s},\ c\bar{c}.
$$
However, the leptonic decays ($e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, $\nu_e\bar{\nu_e}$, $\nu_\mu\bar{\nu_{\mu}}$, $\nu_\tau\bar{\nu_\tau}$) might be the direct candidates for kinematically allowed decays where $m_{\nu} \approx 0$.

So, the kinematically allowed decays for a $6$ GeV $X$ boson could plausibly be listed as follows:
$$
X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \;\mu^+ \mu^-, \;\tau^+ \tau^- (\text{on the edge, $2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \text{ GeV}$}),\\
u\bar{u},\; d\bar{d}, \; c\bar{c},\; s\bar{s}, \;\text{and}\;\text{neutrino pairs such as}\; \bar{\nu}_{e} \nu_e, \bar{\nu}_{\mu} \nu_\mu, \text{ and } \bar{\nu}_\tau \nu_\tau.
$$
However, the decay $X \rightarrow\tau^+\tau^-$ might still be within an acceptable margin since $3.554 \text{ GeV} < 6 \text{ GeV}$. Thus $\tau^+ \tau^-$ should still be kinematically allowed unless there is a round-off issue where $2 \times 1.777 \text{ GeV} \approx 3.554 \text{ GeV}$ is so close to half of $6\text{ GeV}$ that one should make a round-off error check. But it seems just within the allowed threshold where $6\text{ GeV}$ is indeed greater than $2m_\tau$, hence kinematically allowed.

Thus, a comprehensive answer could be:
### Kinematically allowed decays include:
$$
\text{X} \rightarrow u\bar{u},\ d\bar{d},\ c\bar{c},\ s\bar{s},\ e\bar{e},\ \mu\bar{\mu},\ \tau\bar{\tau},\ \nu\bar{\nu} \text{ (for }\nu_e,\ \nu_\mu,\ \nu_\tau).
$$

However, keep in mind that the actual decay channels should be verified concerning particle physics experiment data and the specific context of the question should always be honored such that any fermions with a combined mass less than $m_X = 6 \text{ GeV}$ are kinematically allowed.
