# Original Question

An equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 g was heated to 200°C without air. In this case, only a mixture of gases was formed, which, without cooling, was passed successively through tubes filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (№1), Ca(OH)2 (№2) solution, and red-hot copper (№3). Results: the weights of tubes №1 and №3 increased by 3.60 g and 0.80 g, respectively (CuO formed in tube №3). The weight of the second tube has not changed. As a result, only 2.24 liters of gas C (standard temperature and pressure) remained.
Indicate the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

To solve for the given problem, let us interpret the given chemical problem step-by-step.

Let us assume that the total mass of an equimolar mixture of salts A and B is 7.20 grams. When this mixture is heated to 200°C without air, a mixture of gases is generated. After passing through several stages, here are the given observations:

1. **An anhydrous Mg(ClO4)₂ tube (tube №1) is used primarily to absorb water vapor. An increase in the weight of tube №1 (by (+)3.60 g) suggests that it absorbed water vapor from the gas mixture. Therefore, the mass of H₂O formed during the reaction is 3.60 g. The moles of H₂O produced can be calculated from its mass as follows:**
$$
\text{Moles of H₂O} = \frac{3.60 \text{ g}}{18 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.2 \text{ mol}.
$$

2. **The gas mixture is then passed through a Ca(OH)₂ solution (tube №2), which is typically used to absorb CO₂. However, the question states that the weight of tube №2 did not change. Therefore, no CO₂ was absorbed in tube №2, which means that CO₂ was not one of the gases formed when the mixture was heated.**

3. **The remaining gas mixture proceeds to a third tube filled with red-hot copper (tube №3). The question mentions that the weight of this tube increased by 0.80 g (and that CuO was formed in tube №3). The reaction here is likely the oxidation of copper by some oxidizing gas such as O₂:
$$
2 \text{Cu} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{CuO}.
$$
However, another possible oxidizing compound could be an oxide such as CO₂, but since CO₂ was not detected in tube 2, we need to check another candidate. Another possible reaction could be:
$$
\text{Cu} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{CuO} + \text{H}_2,
$$
However, any H₂O should have already been absorbed in tube №1. Thus, the most likely reaction here is with oxygen that oxidizes copper to CuO. An increase in the mass of tube №3 is the mass of oxygen that interacts with copper to form CuO (since the original Cu metal reacts only with oxygen). The oxygen atoms that react with Cu need to be determined. Let $ x $ be the moles of O₂ that reacts:
$$
2 \text{Cu} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{CuO}.
$$
The molar mass gain here should be entirely due to the oxygen consumed (since the only mass gain comes from the oxygen atoms that turn Cu into CuO).

The weight increase of tube №3 is given as 0.80 g. This weight increase is due to solely the oxygen reacting with copper (since the question mentions that CuO is formed in this tube). Therefore, the mass of oxygen reacting can be calculated as follows:
$$
0.80 \text{ g}.
$$
Since the molecular mass of O₂ is 32 g/mol, the molar amount of O₂ that reacted can be calculated as:
$$
\text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{0.80 \text{ g}}{32 \text{ g/mol}} = 0.025 \text{ mol},
$$
which means that the total mass increment is due to the added oxygen atoms (since oxygen is incorporated into Cu to form CuO, the mass increase equals the mass of oxygen absorbed).

4. **It is mentioned that after tube №3, only 2.24 liters of gas C (measured at standard temperature and pressure) remained. The question needs us to find out what gas this might be. Given standard temperature and pressure, the remaining moles of gas can be calculated using the ideal gas law where $V = 2.24 \text{ L}$ and $n_{\text{gas}} = \frac{V}{22.4 \text{ L/mol}}$:
$$
\text{Moles of gas C} = \frac{2.24}{22.4} = 0.1 \text{ mol}.
$$

So far, the only gas identified that makes up the part of the initial gaseous mixture includes:
- $0.2 \text{mol}$ of H₂O (absorbed in tube №1),
- $0.025 \text{mol}$ of O₂ (reacted with Cu in tube №3).
- $0.1 \text{mol}$ of gas C remains after passing through the three tubes.

Based on what wasn't absorbed in tubes 1 and 2 and what didn't react in tube 3, the only remaining candidate for gas C is a gas that did not react with Mg(ClO4)₂, Ca(OH)₂, or hot copper. An inert gas such as N₂ could be a candidate here.

To find out what salts A and B are, let us first recall what happens when an "equimolar mixture of salts A and B" weighing 7.20 g is heated. Since the question mentions that it is an "equimolar mixture," let us represent the mole of salts A and B as $n$ for both salts so that:
$$
n \cdot (M_A + M_B) = 7.20 \text{ g},
$$
where $M_A$ and $M_B$ are molar masses of salts A and B respectively.

Based on the given information, we need to identify which salts when heated at 200°C could produce a gas mixture including water vapor (0.2 moles H₂O), oxygen (0.025 moles O₂), and another gas (0.1 moles of gas C).

The total mass of the solid residue (if any) should be:
$$
7.20\text{ g}-(0.2 \times 18\text{ g/mol} \text{ (H}_2\text{O)}) - (0.025 \times 32 \text{ g/mol} \text{ (O}_2\text{)}) - \text{(mass of Gas C)}.
$$
However, the mass of gas C needs to be identified first.

However, another part here is that the question mentions that only a "mixture of gases" is formed initially. Thus, it seems that the initial mixture of salts A and B should completely decompose into gases except for any residual solid that did not contribute to the caught gases. 

However, what else reacted in tube №3 besides oxygen? Since tube №3 contained red-hot copper, any reactive gases besides O₂ might react here. Another candidate could be nitric oxide, NO₂ or NO. However, NO₂ can react with Ca(OH)₂ which makes us question why tube №2 did not increase in weight if such a gas was present.

However, an important point here might be ammonia formation if both ammonium salts decompose:
$$
\text{MH}^{+} \rightarrow \text{M} + \text{H}^+ \
