# Original Question

We have a large ensemble of 10.000 (ten thousand) identical systems. Each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions. Each particle can move along along a tube (the x-axis direction).
We know from theoretical modeling that the wave function (from Schrodinger equation) of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as:
( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i; where “i” is the square root of -1, and “sqrt()” means the square root of.
When measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3 (only in between x=1 and x=3).
What is the numerical value of “a”?

To determine the value of $a$ such that the wave function described by:
$$
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
$$
holds true for a part of space where it can exist specifically for $x \in [1, 3]$, the goal is to find the constant $a$ such that the probability density function $|\psi(x)|^2$ when normalized meets the given conditions ("none were found at $x<1$ and $x>3$, only in between $x=1$ and $x=3$").

The question states that the particle was only found within the interval $x \in [1,3]$. Therefore, what we need to do is to make sure that the total probability within that interval should be equal to 1 (because otherwise, there would be some probability of finding the particle outside the given interval). Another important part of the statement implies that the wave function is defined such that the probability of finding the particle outside the interval $x \in [1, 3]$ is zero. However, what we need here is that the total probability should be concentrated entirely on the interval $x \in [1,3]$.

The total probability is given by integrating the probability density function $|\psi(x)|^2$ within the interval where the particle exists (i.e., $x \in [1, 3]$). Thus, the normalization condition becomes:
$$
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
$$
Let us first expand $|\psi(x)|^2$ for the given wave function:
$$
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i.
$$
The square of the absolute value $|\psi(x)|^2$ is given by:
$$
|\psi(x)|^2 = \psi(x) \cdot \psi^{*}(x).
$$
Here, $\psi^{*}(x)$ is the complex conjugate of $\psi(x)$. Given:
$$
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
$$
its complex conjugate (since only the term $-0.5i$ has an imaginary part where $i \to -i$ in conjugation) is:
$$
\psi^{*}(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i.
$$
Thus:
$$
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i\right) \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i\right).
$$
This is a product of the form:
$$
(z_1 - z_2)(z_1 + z_2) = z_1^2 - z_2^2,
$$
where $z_1 = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}$ and $z_2 = 0.5i$, so:
$$
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 - (0.5i)^2.
$$
Recall that $(0.5i)^2 = (0.5)^2 \cdot i^2 = 0.25 \cdot i^2$. Since $i^2 = -1$:
$$
(0.5i)^2 = 0.25 \times (-1) = -0.25.
$$
Thus,
$$
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 - (-0.25) = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + 0.25,
$$
since subtracting a negative value is the same as adding the positive counterpart:
$$
|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
$$
We need to normalize the wave function such that the total probability over the interval $[1,3]$ equals 1:
$$
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
$$
We need to integrate term by term:
$$
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x}\right) \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
$$
We solve the first integral:
$$
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{dx}{1+x}.
$$
Let $u=x+1$ hence $du = dx$. For $x=1$, $u=2$; for $x=3$, $u=4$:
$$
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{du}{u} = a^2 \left[\ln u\right]_2^4 = a^2 (\ln 4 - \ln 2) = a^2 \ln \left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = a^2 \ln 2.
$$
Solve the second integral:
$$
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5.
$$
Combine both parts together:
$$
a^2 \ln 2 + 0.5 = 1.
$$
Solve for $a^2$:
$$
a^2 \ln 2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5,
$$
$$
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln 2} = \frac{1}{2\ln 2} = \frac{1}{2\ln2}.
$$
$$
a = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2 \ln 2}} = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln 2}}.
$$
Typically $a$ is taken to be a real number here (as $a$ should generally be a normalization constant which is real unless specified explicitly otherwise). However, any complex phase factor $e^{i\theta}$ (where $\theta$ is a real number) could be applied to $a$, but only the magnitude matters for normalization here. Nevertheless, such a phase doesn't affect $|a|^2$, so the important part thus seems to be just the absolute value of $a$, which means both positive and negative values for $a$ are valid physically because $|\psi(x)|^2$ depends only on $a^2$.

Thus, the numerical value for $a$ could be:
$$
a = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln 2}} \approx \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \times 0.6931}} \approx \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{1.3863}} \approx \pm 0.8493.
$$
However, a negative sign only affects the phase of the real part of the wave function but keeps the same absolute value. However, by convention, $a$ could be taken as the positive root unless stated otherwise. However, another appropriate check is to make sure that the answer makes sense for our setup.

### Verification (Double-checking the answer)
For $a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \ln 2}}$, the normalized wave function should be:
$$\psi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \ln 2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln 2(1+x)}} - 0.5i.$$
However, this result needs to be verified by making sure that the normalization indeed makes sense here. 

We need once again to check our normalization step explicitly:
$$
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + 0.25 = 
\left(\frac{\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln 2}}}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + 0.25 = \left(\frac{1}{(1+x)} \cdot \frac{1}{2\ln 2}\right) + 0.25 = \frac{1}{2\ln 2 (1+x)} + 0.25,
$$
Integrate it over the interval $[1, 3]$:
$$
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = \int_{1}^{3} \left[\frac{1}{2\ln 2 (1+x)} + 0.25\right] dx,
$$
$$
= \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{2\ln 2} \cdot \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx,
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{2\ln 2} \int_{1}^{3} \frac{dx}{1+x} + 0.25 (3 - 1),
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{2\ln 2} \left[\ln|1+x|\right]_{1}^{3} + 0.25 \times 2,
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{2\ln 2} [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] + 0.5,
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{2\ln 2} \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) + 0.5,
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{2\ln 2} \ln 2 + 0.5,
$$
$$
= \frac{\ln 2}{2\ln 2 + 0.5} \text{(seems a bit wrong in the notation. We need to recall that }0.5\text{ should be outside the fraction. It should be written as:}
$$
$$
= \frac{\ln 2}{2\downarrow\ln 2} + 0.5,
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{2} + 0.5,
$$
$$
= 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.
$$
So this checks out correctly. 

Thus, the value of $a$ should be:
$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \ln 2}}} \approx 0.8493218,
$$
which is approximately $0.849$ (keeping a few digits of precision), or equivalently, the negative version works as well such that $a = \pm 0.849$ could be used, but the positive value is usually used conventionally. Nonetheless, the negative value is mathematically valid as well. Thus, any round-off should keep an adequate precision based on the question statement needs. However, from a strict adherence perspective, the answer $a = \pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln 2}}$ is mathematically appropriate.

However, another round-off for the square root of $2 \ln 2$ is:
$$
\sqrt{2 \times 0.693147} \approx \sqrt{1.386294} \approx 1.17741,
$$
so $a \approx \frac{1}{1.17741} \approx 0.8493$ (rounded to four decimal places).

However, an alternative round-off from:
$$
\ln(2) \approx 0.6931,
$$
thus:
$$
a = \pm \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{0.6931}} \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.8493,
$$
which seems itself a round-off error because:
$$
a = \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{0.6931}} \neq \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{0.6931}}.
$$
Instead what we need here is:
$$
a = \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{\ln 2}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{\ln 2}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5}{0.6931}} \approx \sqrt{0.721347} \approx 0.8493218.
$$
However, what seems an actual mistake here is that:
$$
a \approx \pm 0.84932.
$$

However, it makes sense if we verify the total probability explicitly once again one step at a time:

Thus, the reasoning works here correctly as verified thoroughly so the real part of the function $\frac{a^{2}}{1+x}$ contributes half while $\frac{1}{4}$ contributes the other half when integrated from $1$ to $3$.

So, the answer seems reasonable and justified. Another important check here is that the probability should be zero for $x < 1$ or $ > 3$, which makes sense since the question explicitly states that "no particles were found outside $[1, 3]$, meaning that the probability should be zero (or negligible) outside this interval. Our calculated $|\psi(x)|^2$ is valid only for $1\leq x \leq 3$, which fits.
