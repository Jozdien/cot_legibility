# Original Question

While designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, Mike connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment, aiming to minimize the presence of gas molecules for improved electron microscopy. However, as expected, some gas particles remained inside the compartment, as detected by the mass spectrometer. Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr) to be λ1, based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he made an intriguing observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same.

What can we conclude about λ2 based on the aforementioned scenario?

To solve for the mean free path of gas molecules in a vacuum state and compare it to the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules, we need to recall the formula for the mean free path of gas molecules colliding with each other.

The mean free path (λ) for a gas molecule colliding with other gas molecules is given by the formula:

$$
\lambda_1 = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P},
$$
where:
- $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature,
- $d$ is the effective diameter of the gas molecules,
- $P$ is the pressure of the gas.

However, another common form of the mean free path formula is:
$$
\lambda_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n},
$$
where $n$ is the number density of gas molecules (number of molecules per unit volume). The relation between $n$ and $P$ is given by the ideal gas law:
$$
P = n k_B T,
$$
which makes the two forms of the mean free path formula equivalent.

However, the question mentions that Mike is also interested in the "mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules." The mean free path for an electron colliding with gas molecules can be defined similarly, but the "effective target area" might be different because the "size" of an electron is much smaller than that of a gas molecule. 

The mean free path for an electron colliding with gas molecules can be defined as:
$$
\lambda_2 = \frac{1}{\sigma n},
$$
where $\sigma$ is the cross-sectional area for electron-gas molecule collisions (which might be different from the cross-sectional area for gas-gas molecule collisions, which is typically $\pi d^2$ for gas-gas collisions where $d$ is the molecular diameter).

However, the question states that the "mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules" is denoted as $\lambda_2$. The question asks us to compare $\lambda_1$ (mean free path for gas molecules colliding with each other) and $\lambda_2$ (mean free path for electrons colliding with gas molecules).

To make a comparison, let us recall that the mean free path for gas molecules colliding with each other is:
$$
\lambda_1 = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n}.
$$
The "$\sqrt{2}$" factor in the denominator arises because gas molecules are all moving relative to each other. The relative velocity is on average $\sqrt{2}$ times the average velocity of a single molecule (assuming all molecules are identical).

However, for an electron colliding with gas molecules, the "relative velocity" is dominated by the electron's velocity because electrons are much lighter and thus typically move much faster than gas molecules (especially when accelerated by a 1000 kV voltage). The mean free path for an electron colliding with stationary gas molecules (since the electron's velocity is usually much higher than that of gas molecules, the gas molecules can be approximated as stationary) is:
$$
\lambda_2 = \frac{1}{\sigma n}.
$$
The cross-section $\sigma$ here might be different from the cross-section used for gas-gas collisions (which is $\pi d^2$). However, the question does not provide a specific cross-section for electron-gas molecule collisions. 

However, what we need to compare here is the "mean free path" for gas-gas collisions versus electron-gas collisions. The question states that the "mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules" is denoted as $\lambda_2$, while the "mean free path of gas molecules" (i.e., gas-gas collisions) is denoted as $\lambda_1$. 

The question states that the "mean free path of gas molecules" (i.e., gas-gas collisions) is $\lambda_1$, which is:
$$
\lambda_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n}.
$$
However, for the "mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules," the question states that it is $\lambda_2$. 

The main question here is what the relation between $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ should be. 

The key part here is that the "mean free path" for an electron colliding with gas molecules should be compared to the "mean free path" for gas molecules colliding with each other. 

The mean free path for a single "particle" (whether it is a gas molecule or an electron) colliding with gas molecules can be written as:
$$
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sigma n}.
$$
For gas-gas collisions, the "particle" is another gas molecule where the cross-section is $\sigma = \sqrt{2} \pi d^2$ (including the $\sqrt{2}$ factor because both gas molecules are moving). 

However, for an electron colliding with a gas molecule, the cross-section might be different. However, the question does not provide a specific cross-section for electron-gas molecule collisions. However, what we need to know is whether the cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule is larger or smaller than the cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule.

However, a key point here is that the cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule is usually smaller than the cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule because an electron is much smaller than a gas molecule. However, the cross-section for an electron might still be significant because it is determined by the "interaction" between the electron and the gas molecule, which might be on the order of the size of the gas molecule itself (since the electron interacts with the electron cloud of the gas molecule).

However, a more intuitive way to think about it is that the "target" for an electron is a gas molecule whose "size" is defined by its cross-section (which is on the order of $\pi d^2$ where $d$ is the molecular diameter). However, the "target" for a gas molecule is another gas molecule whose "size" is also defined by a cross-section of $\pi d^2$. 

However, the "relative velocity" for gas-gas collisions is on average $\sqrt{2}$ times the velocity of a single gas molecule. For an electron colliding with a gas molecule, the relative velocity is approximately the velocity of the electron itself (since the electron's velocity is usually much higher than that of a gas molecule). However, the "mean free path" itself does not directly depend on the relative velocity; it only depends on the cross-section and the number density $n$:
$$
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sigma n}.
$$
However, the question seems to be asking us to make a comparison between $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. 

However, the question states that the "mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules" is $\lambda_2$, which is different from $\lambda_1$. 

However, the question states that the "mean free path of gas molecules" (i.e., gas-gas collisions) is $\lambda_1$, which is:
$$
\lambda_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n}.
$$
The "mean free path" for an electron colliding with gas molecules should be:
$$
\lambda_2 = \frac{1}{\sigma n}.
$$
where $\sigma$ is the cross-section for electron-gas molecule collisions. 

However, the question states that the "mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules" is "no longer equal to $\lambda_1$; rather, it was $\lambda_2$." 

The question now is what the cross-section $\sigma$ for electron-gas molecule collisions should be compared to $\pi d^2$. 

However, the cross-section for electron-gas molecule collisions is usually smaller than the cross-section for gas-gas molecule collisions because the "size" of an electron is negligible compared to a gas molecule. However, the "interaction" cross-section might still be significant. 

However, a more important part here is that the "mean free path" for an electron should be:
$$
\lambda_2 = \frac{1}{\sigma n}.
$$
where $\sigma$ is the cross-section for electron-gas molecule collisions. 

However, the question states that the "mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules" is "no longer equal to $\lambda_1$." 

However, the question seems to imply that the "mean free path" for an electron should be longer than that for gas molecules colliding with each other because the cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule should be smaller than the cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule. 

However, a more common way to interpret the "mean free path" for an electron in a gas is that the "mean free path" should be longer because the cross-section for an electron is usually smaller than the cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule. 

However, a more "intuitive" way to make a comparison is that:
$$
\lambda_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n} \text{ (gas-gas collisions)}
$$
$$
\lambda_2 = \frac{1}{\sigma n} \text{ (electron-gas collisions)}
$$
where $\sigma$ is the cross-section for electron-gas molecule collisions. 

However, if $\sigma < \sqrt{2} \pi d^2$, then:
$$
\lambda_2 > \lambda_1.
$$
However, if $\sigma > \sqrt{2} \pi d^2$, then:
$$
\lambda_2 < \lambda_1.
$$
However, the cross-section for an electron colliding with a gas molecule is usually smaller than the cross-section for a gas molecule colliding with another gas molecule because the "size" of an electron is negligible compared to a gas molecule. 

However, a more "realistic" cross-section for electron-gas molecule collisions might be on the order of the "geometric" cross-section of the gas molecule itself (i.e., $\pi d^2$), which makes the comparison:
$$
\lambda_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n} \text{ (gas-gas collisions)}
$$
$$
\lambda_2 \approx \frac{1}{\pi d^2 n} \text{ (assuming $\sigma \approx \pi d^2$ for electron-gas collisions)}
$$
$$
\lambda_2 = \frac{1}{\pi d^2 n} \text{ (excluding the $\sqrt{2}$ factor because the electron is much faster than the gas molecules, so the relative velocity is approximately the electron's velocity)}
$$
$$
\lambda_2 = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n} = \sqrt{2} \lambda_1.
$$
However, this makes an assumption that the cross-section for electron-gas molecule collisions is the same as the cross-section for gas-gas molecule collisions except for the $\sqrt{2}$ factor.
