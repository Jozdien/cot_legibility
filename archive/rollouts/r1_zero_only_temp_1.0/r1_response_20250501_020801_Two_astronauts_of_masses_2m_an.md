# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

To solve for the relative speed between two astronauts traveling in the same direction along the positive $x$-direction with velocities $u_1 = 0.6\,c$ and $u_2=0.5\,c$, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula since the velocities involved are a significant fraction of the speed of light $c$. The relativistic velocity addition formula for two velocities $u_1$ and $u_2$, where both are velocities in the positive $x$-direction relative to a stationary observer, is given by:

$$
u_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u_2 - u_1}{1 - \frac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}}.
$$
However, what this formula gives us here is actually the velocity of astronaut 2 (with velocity $u_2$) as observed from the frame of astronaut 1 (who travels with velocity $u_1$) if both are moving along the positive $x$-axis where $u_1$ and $u_2$ are given with respect to a stationary observer. 

The question states that astronaut 1 has mass $2m$ and travels at $0.6c$, while astronaut 2 has mass $3m$ and travels at $0.5c$. 

Plugging $u_1 = 0.6c$ and $u_2 = 0.5c$ into the relativistic velocity addition formula gives us:
$$
u_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - (0.5 \cdot 0.6)} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.143c.
$$
The negative sign here indicates that the second astronaut (whose speed relative to the stationary observer is $0.5c$) appears to be moving in the negative $x$-direction from the perspective of the first astronaut traveling at $u_1 = .6c$. 

However, the question appears to ask for the "relative speed" (which should be a positive scalar value). The "relative speed" should be the magnitude of the relative velocity (which makes it positive). Thus, the relative speed should be:
$$
|u_{\text{rel}}| \approx 0.1429\,c \approx 0.143\,c.
$$

Second part of the question is about finding the total energy of the system. The total energy $E$ for a particle moving at a relativistic speed $u$ where $u$ is the velocity of the particle (relative to an observer) and $m_0$ is the rest mass of the particle is given by:
$$
E = \gamma m_0 c^2,
$$
where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{u^2}{c^2}}}\, .
$$

Let us first find the total energy for astronaut 1 (who has rest mass $m_{10} = 2m$ and velocity $u_1=0.6c$). The Lorentz factor for $u_1=0.6c$ is:
$$
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{0.6c}{c}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25.
$$
So the energy $E_1$ for astronaut $1$ (with rest mass $2m$) is:
$$
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_{10} c^2 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = (1.25) \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \times 2 mc^2\\
= 2.5mc^2.
$$

Similarly, for astronaut $2$, who has rest mass $m_{20} = 3m$ and velocity $u_2=0.5c$, the Lorentz factor for $u_2=0.5c$ is:
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{0.5c}{c}\right)^ |-2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3/4}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{2}{1.732} \approx 1.1547.
$$
Therefore, the energy $E_2$ for astronaut $2$ (with rest mass $3m$) is:
$$
E_2 = \gamma_2 m_{20} c^2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = \left(\frac{2 \times 3}{\sqrt{3}}\right)mc^2 = \frac{6}{\sqrt{3}}mc^2 = \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{3}mc^2 = 2\sqrt{3}mc^2.\\
\text{(Note that } 2\sqrt{3} \text{ is approximately } 3.4641.)
$$
$$
\approx 2 \times 1.732 \times mc^2 \approx 3.4641 mc^2.
$$

Finally, the total energy $E_{\text{total}}$ for the system of the two astronauts is thus:
$$
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 2\sqrt{3}mc^2 = \left(2.5 + 2\sqrt{3}\right)mc^2.
$$
To round $2 \sqrt{3}$ to a few decimal places for a cleaner answer:
$$
2\sqrt{3} \approx 2 \times 1.732 = 3.464.
$$
However, it's better to keep the answer in a more exact fractional form where possible.

So:
$$
E_{\text{total}} = \left(2.5 + 2\sqrt{3}\right)mc^2\approx (2.5 +  3.464)mc^2\approx 5.964 mc^2\ (\text{rounding to three decimal places).
}
$$
$$
\approx 5.964 mc^2.
$$

However, a literal calculation keeping the square root until the end seems more appropriate:
$$
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = (1.25\cdot 2)mc^2 + \left(\frac{6}{\sqrt{3}}\right)mc^2 = (2.5 + 2\sqrt{3})mc^2.
$$
Thus presenting the total energy for the system as:
$$
\left(2.5 + 2\sqrt{3}\right)mc^2.
$$
However, another way to give a numerical value for $2\sqrt{3}$ instead of $3.464$ could be:
$$
\gamma_2\, \text{exact} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \text{ (usually if you need the inverse Lorentz factor)}.
$$

However, the full total energy calculation thus seems solid enough just by computing the individual contributions and adding them together.

However, another way to state the total energy might be:
![Referring closely to the total relativistic energy formula again:
]
$$
E_{total} = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 + \gamma_2 (3m)c^2.
$$
Since $\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{0.8} = \frac{5}{4}$:
$$
\gamma_1 = \frac{5}{4}!
$$
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{3}{4}}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}.
$$
Thus:
$$
E_{total} =( \frac{5}{4} \times 2 + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \times 3)mc^2 = \left(\frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3}\right)mc^2 = \left(\frac{5}{2} + 2\sqrt{3}\right)mc^2.
$$
Calculating $ \frac{5}{2}$ directly returns $2.5$, so:
$$
E_{\text{total}} = \left(2.5 + 2\sqrt{physics3}\right) \,mc^2.
$$

To verify any round-off quantities for easy calculator computations:
$$\gamma_1 \equiv \gamma(0.6c) = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25,$$
$$
\gamma_2 = \gamma(0.5c) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.1547.
$$
Total energies can thus be verified individually:
Total energy for astronaut 1:
$$
E_1 = \gamma_~\left(0.6\mathrm{c}\right) \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 =  for\,\text{(given $2m$ rest mass)}\\
= (1.25) \cdot 2mc^2 = 2.5mc^2.
$$
Total energy for astronaut 2:
$$
E_2 = gamma_2\cdot 3m\cdot c^2; \text{ (given $3m$ rest mass)}\\
\left(\frac{电弧2}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \cdot 3m\mathrm{c^2} = 2\sqrt{3} mc^2.
$$
So the total energy calculated earlier combining above two should be valid.

### Conclusion:

1. Relative speed $ \simeq \boxed{0.143c}$ (or more accurately any version around forms such as $-\frac{0.1}{0.7} c$).
2. Total energy $ = (2.5 + 2\sqrt{3})mc^2$, equivalently computed doesn't need unit conversion, so $61.25mcr^2$ seems practically plausible for checks such as:
Whatever rounds $2\sqrt{3}$ serves should be alright here too:
So you should check values if original computations are needed.

Henceforth:
$$
\text{E_{\text{total}}=}\approx 5.96 mc^2
$$
is a numerical version keeping significant digits across the round-off till three digits (.143 and 5.964). But approximately formatting our answers accurately:

Total energy should be:
$$
(2.5 + 2\sqrt{3})mc^2.
$$
Thus:

1. The relative speed $= \boxed{\dfrac{-c}{7}} \approx -0.143c$ (note that the question might require only the absolute value of the relative speed, which thus makes it $0.143c$ or just mention it as $c/7 \approx 0.143c$).

2. Total energy of the system $= \left(2.5 + 2\sqrt{3}\right)mc^2$. This remains an approximate numerical value which would be $2.5mc^2 + 2 \cdot 1.732mc^2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464 mc^2 = 5.964mcÏ²$.

Therefore, approximating $2.5 + 2\sqrt{3} \approx 5.9641,$ which appears sufficient for most contexts. However, keep $2.5 + 2\sqrt{3}$ for an answer in a more "exact" form.

Incidentally, double-check verifying round-off figures ensures:
So $|u_{\text{rel}}| \approx 0.142857c$, i.e., correctly within the scope of $0.143c$. Note that $2.5mc^2 + 2\sqrt{3}mc^2$ directly sums up permissible roundings for totalエネルギー.

Therefore both unified refined answers are:
**Relative speed: $\dfrac{c}{7}$ (which is approximately $0.143 \, c$).**
**Total energy of the system: $(2.5 + 2\sqrt{3})mc^2.$**

Checking multiplicative coefficients veritability would hint that:
$$
U_{\text{relative}} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = \frac{-1c}{7} (\text{-ve sign indicates direction but here asked for speed hence just using positive val常见 -= 0.143c})
$$
This settles computations done properly for the given problem!
