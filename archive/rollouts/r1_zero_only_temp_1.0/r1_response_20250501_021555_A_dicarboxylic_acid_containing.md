# Original Question

A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.

The 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.

In the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?

To solve for which two resonances exhibit a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum for the major product (which is present in the major product's spectrum but weak or absent in the minor product's spectrum), we need to first interpret what the given information tells us about the anhydride and its reaction with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.

1. **Formation of anhydride from a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene:**
    
    A dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene could be represented as:
    
    $$\text{HOOC-CH=CH-COOH}$$
    
    However, the actual dicarboxylic acid mentioned here is specifically a "cis-alkene" dicarboxylic acid. The most well-known cis-alkene dicarboxylic acid is cis-butenedioic acid (maleic acid, which is actually the cis-isomer called usually specifically maleic acid, while the trans-isomer is called fumaric acid). However, maleic acid undergoes dehydration relatively easily to form maleic anhydride.

    The dehydration reaction for maleic acid can be represented as follows:
    
    $$\underset{\text{Maleic acid}}{\text{HOOC-CH=CH-COOH}} \rightarrow \underset{\text{Maleic anhydride}}{\text{(CHCO)}_2O} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$$

2. **Details about the anhydride:**

    The question states that the anhydride has:
    - A single peak in its 1H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm. For maleic anhydride, which has a structure like:

$$\begin{array}{c}
\ce{O} \\
\phantom{}\backslash\phantom{} \\
\ce{C} \\
\phantom{}/\phantom{}\backslash\phantom{} \\
\ce{CH} \\
\phantom{}=\phantom{}/\phantom{}\backslash\phantom{} \\
\ce{CH} \\
\phantom{}\backslash\phantom{}/\phantom{} \\
\ce{C} \\
\phantom{}/\phantom{} \\
\ce{O} \\
\end{array}$$

    Chemical formula is $\text{C$_4$H$_2$O$_3$}$. The two hydrogen atoms are equivalent because the molecule has twofold rotational symmetry (which makes the two carbon-carbon double bond hydrogens chemically equivalent), so there is only one peak in the 1H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm.

    - Two peaks in its 13C NMR spectrum at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. In maleic anhydride, the alkene carbons are typically observed at around 137 ppm while the carbonyl carbons are typically observed at a lower field (higher ppm values around 170 ppm, so the question states that the peak for carbonyl carbons appears at 165 ppm seems a bit lower than usual, but that's still a reasonable chemical shift for a carbonyl carbon in an anhydride).

Note that the anhydride is thus likely maleic anhydride, whose structure is:

$$\begin{array}{c}
\ce{O=C} \\
\phantom{}- \ce{\underset{\text{137 ppm}}{\underset{|}{\underset{C}{\underset{CH}{||}}}}} \\
\phantom{}- \ce{\underset{137 ppm}{\underset{\underset{|}{CH}}{\underset{\underset{|}{C}}{||}}}} \\
\ce{O=C} \\
\end{array}
$$
This shows:
    - Two hydrogen atoms which are chemically equivalent (thus one peak in the 1H NMR spectrum).
    - Two types of carbon atoms: two alkene carbon atoms (both should appear at around 137 ppm) and two carbonyl carbon atoms (which should appear at around 165 ppm).

3. **Reaction of maleic anhydride with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene:**

    The reaction here is most likely a Diels-Alder reaction where maleic anhydride acts as the dienophile and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene acts as the diene. 

The structure of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is:

$$\begin{array}{c}
\ce{(CH3)\underset{1}{\overset{\phantom{5}}{\overset{|}{C}}-}\overset{(CH3)}{\overset{2}{\underset{}{C}}}-\underset{3}{\underset{(CH3)}{\underset{|}{C}}}=\overset{4}{\overset{(CH3)}{\overset{\phantom{5}}{\overset{|}{C}}}}-CH2}
\end{array}\text{ (Note that there seems to be a mistake here as this makes five carbon atoms and four methyl groups which sums to nine carbons instead of nine atoms overall which should be $\text{C9H14}$. Another valid structure might be needed.)}
$$

Alternatively, an accurate structure for 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene should confirm the total carbon count:
$$
\ce{(CH3)2-C5H2-(CH3)2}
$$
This makes nine carbon atoms (including the cyclopentadiene ring which has five carbons and four extra carbon atoms from the methyl groups), yielding a total molecular formula of $\text{C$_9$H$_{14}$}$.

However $\ce{C9H14}$ should be taken correctly by verifying the prior part needs structure verification:
For a cyclopentadiene with 4 methyl groups attached to carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4 could be drawn as:
$$
\ce{(CH3)2C=CH-C(CH3)=CH-CH3}
$$
However, "1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene" should be:
$$
\ce{{(CH3)2C5H2(CH3)2}} \text{ or another structured way to write that might be: } \underset{(1)}{\ce{(CH3)C}} \text{—} \underset{(2)}{\ce{(CH3)C}} \text{—} \underset{(3)}{\ce{(CH3)C}} \text{=} \underset{(4)}{\ce{(CH3)C}} \text{—} \underset{(5)}{\ce{CH2}}.
$$
However, there is another tautomer called 5-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetraminyl cyclopentadiene where the double bonds shift so that the double-bond arrangement makes sense for a resonance structure where the most stable form should ideally have two double bonds in a conjugated manner such that:
$$
\ce{{CH3}2C5H2{CH3}2}
$$
thus,
The reaction with maleic anhydride should thus yield a Diels-Alder adduct whose stoichiometry needs verification:
$$
\ce{C4H2O3 + C9H14 -> C13H16O3}
$$
Let us verify the molecular formula sum:
$$
\text{Maleic anhydride: } \text{C4H2O3} \\
\text{Molecular formula sum: } \text{C4H2O3} + \text{C9H14} = \text{C13H16O3}
$$
And the reaction should thus yield a cycloaddition product where the molecular formula is indeed given as C13H16O3 (verified).

4. **Major and minor products formed:**

Based on symmetry and steric effects for a Diels-Alder reaction where the diene is asymmetric such as 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, there are two possible "endo" and "exo" configurations based on the given methyl groups' positions on cyclohexene ring formed from the Diels-Alder reaction where the anhydride ring usually stays along the "bottom" face such that the reaction could lead to:
Major and minor products due to "endo" and "exo" addition (exo and endo refer to the relative position of the anhydride bridge relative to the other part of the product).

However, more important here seems to be the existence of a "cross-peak" in the NOESY NMR spectrum only present in the major product. A NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy) cross-peak indicates that two atoms are close spatially (generally less than 5 Å apart). 

5. **The question asks us to identify which two resonances exhibit a cross-peak in the major product's NOESY NMR spectrum.**

Based on the Diels-Alder reaction, the two possible products might look like:

![Diels-Alder reaction possibilities involving maleic anhydride and an asymmetric diene](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imgsrv.fcgi?cid=7923&t=l)

However, a relevant part here is that the question mentions "this cross-peak" referring to a cross-peak that is "absent or very weak" in the minor product's spectrum. 

The main candidates here are "endo" and "exo" Diels-Alder adducts where the "endo" rule often makes the "endo" product the major one because of favorable secondary orbital interactions. Thus, the major product should probably exhibit a NOESY signal that shows a spatial interaction between a proton from the maleic anhydride part (which only has one type of hydrogen atom initially at 7 ppm) and protons on the cyclopentadiene part's methyl groups.

The question here asks us about the "integrals from the corresponding 1H NMR." Since the question mentions that both major and minor products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3, the products consist of the anhydride part (C4H2O3) and the cyclopentadiene part (C9H14), which sums to C13H16O3. 

To identify what’s happening with the adducts formed, let us first identify the total protons present originally in maleic anhydride (2 protons). After reacting with the diene (which has 14 protons), the total number of protons should typically be:
$$
2 + 14 = 16
$$
Which matches the molecular formula for the products C13H16O3. Therefore, after forming an adduct, the new compound should have a total of 16 protons which should be distributed in such a way that some part of the ring now has six carbons (formed by adding maleic anhydride to the cyclopentadiene). 

Additionally, the question mentions that the "major" and "minor" product have specific NOESY data where a cross-peak is present in the major product but not in the minor product's NOESY spectrum. 

The key NOESY cross-peaks usually arise from the interaction between the two protons that are close in space but not necessarily connected by covalent bonds. Since maleic anhydride on its own exhibits a single proton signal at 7 ppm for the olefinic protons, after the Diels-Alder reaction, the newly formed single bond would make the original olefinic protons distinct (and move to a different chemical shift).

Hence, any cross-peak described should indicate a proximity interaction between a proton from the anhydride part (which initially appeared at 7 ppm) and another part of the adduct - most likely part of the cyclopentadiene part. 

However, post-reaction, the six-membered ring formed should now have a new "bridge" proton (which was part of the double bond but now is a single bond). The original 7 ppm peak must change since the double bond character changes completely into a single bond. 

From Diels-Alder reactions involving maleic anhydride, usually the "bridgehead" hydrogens (the part where anhydride is attached) typically shift from around 7 ppm to a region around 3-4 ppm (since they are now part of an alkane instead of a double bond). 

Based on such reasoning, another candidate cross-peak would be a proton signal close to where the former maleic anhydride's protons were located (now might be a bit different because the chemical environment has changed).

To identify the two resonances connected by this cross-peak, it makes sense to check different possibilities such as proton peaks arising from the anhydride part might interact with a methyl group on the cyclopentadiene part which could vary in chemical shift (typically methyl protons appear at approximately 0.9 ppm to 1.5 ppm range).

However, for a NOESY cross-peak to be "absent (or very weak) in the minor product," this implies that whatever two protons are interacting closely in the major product, they are not as close in the minor product. 

If assuming that the "major" reaction product follows the "endo" rule where the electron-rich part of the diene (cyclopentadiene part) needs to be oriented towards the carbonyl groups of maleic anhydride, the interaction might be such that one proton on the anhydride part might be close to a methyl group's protons only in the major ("endo") product.

The answer should be such that:
1. The cross-peak should be present only in the major isomer (likely when the anhydride part is "close" to a methyl group proton).
2. The major product should have a cross-peak connecting a methyl group signal (typically around 1-2 ppm) and a signal from another part which comes from the part derived from maleic anhydride's double bond (which might now appear somewhere below 7 ppm).

Based on the question statement, check whether answers like {(1.2, 6.2), (5.6, 1.6), (3.4, 1.6), (3.4, 1.9)} make sense. Since no actual 1H NMR data are given explicitly for the two products except for the integral values mentioned related to the cross-peak, a common case in a Diels-Alder reaction is that cross-peaks are seen between the "bridgehead" carbon hydrogens (which would probably shift now from the 7 ppm area to somewhere else) and any nearby methyl group if they are spatially close.

However, based on an educated guess, a reasonable candidate for a cross-peak might be a signal due to a proton originally from maleic anhydride (which would be a singlet at 7 ppm before reaction; after reaction, might be a different chemical shift) and a methyl group signal which would typically be around 1-2 ppm.

Suppose that two resonances could be labeled as chemical shifts such as "x" and "y" where the question mentions "two resonances connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)," thus we need clues from the provided multiple choice options and the analysis should point us generally to two signals where one is a probable CH proton on the product's formed ring (related to the 7 ppm signal which changed now due to Diels-Alder reaction).

Analyzing the question requires also a bit of a visual sketch of predominant more stable configurations (endo is usually favored due to second orbital interactions). 

However, a more in-depth molecular modeling would allow us to make a drawing where the major product should have a significant interaction between a particular methyl group and the part derived from the maleic anhydride part where the part at 7 ppm for the pure anhydride has now transformed.

Thus, a common peak in the NOESY spectrum could be due to a significant spatial interaction which could be one of the provided pairs such as:
1. "1.2 ppm with 6.2 ppm": unlikely because it seems like an unlikely pair where one might be a methyl group (1.2 ppm) and another could be from part of an unsaturated region (~6.2 ppm).
2. "5.6 ppm with 1.6 ppm": seems more plausible where 5.6 ppm might be still part of an unsaturated part (which could be part of another double bond if one still exists in the adduct).
3. "3.4 ppm with 1.6 ppm": quite feasible where 3.4 ppm might be a CH part connected to some electronegative part while 1.6 ppm might be a methyl group.
4. "3.4 ppm with 1.9 ppm": 1.9 ppm might still be a methyl group as well.

Based on the maleic anhydride part should lose its double bond character implying that the proton which was originally at 7 ppm might now be in the 2.5 - 3.5 ppm range if it is part of a cycloaddition formed ring. 

Given that the cross-peak must indicate a close spatial interaction between two protons that should be clearly distinct in the major product versus minor product, a common pair could be:
3.4 ppm and 1.6 ppm seem like plausible resonances where an original "7 ppm" proton might now be seen around 3-4 ppm while a methyl group around 1.6 ppm shows spatial proximity only in the major product where typically endo products make the anhydride bridge close to other groups on the main part of the cyclopentadiene part.

Based on this reasoning, the cross-beam is most likely connecting **3.4 ppm and ~1.6 ppm** signals seems logical. Another valid pair could be 6.41 ppm which highlights differences in steric influences.

Considering other possibilities and confirming if an understanding makes sense:
#### Answer:
- Let one part be around 3.4 ppm (bridgehead carbon's hydrogen) and another part could be a methyl group at around 1.6 ppm (1.6 ppm is methyl group proton where -CH3 protons usually appear between 1-2 ppm).
    
However, verifying the specific NOESY interactions requires a specific reaction product structure where indeed a cross-peak should be seen only in the major product. 

However, a typical choice here should be:
A plausible answer here might be:
**3.4 (singlet, 1H) and 1.6 (singlet, 3H).**

Based on this reasoning, a cross-peak might be between a bridgehead proton and a methyl group proton where such a spatial closeness only exists in the major product.

However, another very necessary cross-check could be analyzing the product stability. Remember that "endo" products are usually major because of the "endo" rule.

After rendering out the reaction explicitly:
1. The dienophile has plane symmetry so it only reacts in one orientation (no regiochemistry issue).
2. Reacting with a symmetric diene such as cyclopentadiene itself only yields two isomers (“endo” versus “exo”), but an asymmetric diene could possibly yield two regioisomers (like "head-to-head" versus "head-to-tail"), but such a case should be checked if the diene works symmetrically here.

Consulting with commonly known Diels-Alder products between maleic anhydride and symmetric dienes seem to make "endo" product major.

To visualize:
Since both formed products should have a molecular formula of $\text{C13H16O3}$, it means both should have identical atoms but possibly different stereochemistry due to "endo" versus "exo" addition.

Let us make a structured guess about where the protons might be.

However, an important part here is that major products exhibit a NOESY cross-peak whereas minor products do not. Thus, it seems like the interaction which differs mainly lies upon the "3.4 ppm (integration is
