To solve for the reaction involving 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK (tert-butoxide potassium), let us first identify what reaction type this is.

The question mentions "2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone" reacting with "ethyl acrylate" in the presence of t-BuOK. The reaction between a ketone (in this case, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone) and ethyl acrylate (ethyl propenoate, which is CH2=CH-COOCH2CH3) in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK typically corresponds to a Michael addition reaction where a ketone (specifically, an enolate formed from the ketone) adds to the β-carbon (Michael acceptor) of α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds like ethyl acrylate. 

#### Step-by-step reasoning for Reaction 1: "2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A"

1. The first part of the reaction is the deprotonation of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone by t-BuOK to generate an enolate ion:
The structure of "2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone" is:
   
   A cyclohexanone ring where there is a keto group (C=O bond) at carbon 1 (position 1 is where the ketone is). The question states that there is a 2-ethyl substituent and two methyl groups, one at position 2 and another at position 6. Thus, the structure can be represented as follows:
   
   - A cyclohexanone where:
   - There is a ketone group at carbon 1.
   - There is an ethyl group and a methyl group on carbon 2 (making it a quaternary carbon because it already has a ketone group connection on one side and thus connects to three additional groups).
   - Another methyl group is on carbon 6.

The full IUPAC name "2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one" thus breaks down like this:
   
   Cyclohexanone (cyclohexane with a ketone at carbon 1) numbered such that the ketone group is on carbon 1. Thus, carbon 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group connected making it a quaternary carbon (since carbon 2 already has a connection to carbon 1 (keto group), carbon 3, an ethyl group, and a methyl group, so it is bonded to a total of 4 other carbon atoms).

The drawn structure looks approximately like:
   

   \chemfig{*6(-((=O))-(-(=[::90]CH_3)-[::-90]CH_2CH_3)-(-CH_3)--(=O)-(-CH_3)-)}

However, for a more standardized representation, you need to draw the structure such that:
   (1) Carbon-1 is where the carbonyl carbon is located.
   (2) Carbon-2 has a methyl group (CH3) and an ethyl group (CH2CH3).
   (3) Carbon-6 has another methyl group.

2. The next thing that happens is deprotonation at the α-carbon (which means either carbon 2 or carbon 6 because only those are α-carbons relative to the keto group at carbon 1). However, in practice, deprotonation occurs preferentially at the less hindered α-carbon despite the more substituted enolate being more stabilized. However, in this molecule specifically, carbon 2 is a quaternary carbon and thus cannot undergo deprotonation because it has no α-hydrogen atoms (since it is already bonded to carbon 3, another carbon in the ring, ethyl group, and a methyl group). 

The only remaining α-position with a hydrogen that can be deprotonated is at carbon 6, which has a methyl group attached and thus has α-hydrogens on that methyl group which could be deprotonated. However, carbon 6 itself also has an α-hydrogen (as part of the ring itself). Thus, the enolate should be formed via deprotonation at carbon α-position (carbon 6).

This enolate would be formed at carbon 6 because the only α-hydrogens are found there. The enolate formed should thus attack the β-position (Michael position) of "ethyl acrylate":

The reaction scheme could be:
$$
\ce{(2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone) + (t-BuOK) ->[t-BuOK] Enolate}
$$
$$
\ce{Enolate + CH2=CH-COOEt -> [(Michael Addition)] Intermediate ->[Hydrolysis] Product A}
$$
$$
Product A should be formed by the addition of the enolate ion to the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt), which gives us a 1,4-addition product where the enolate carbon attacks the β-position forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

However, the reaction here calls for "stability and steric hindrance" considerations. After the formation of the enolate on carbon 6, it acts as a nucleophile that attacks the β-carbon on ethyl acrylate (Michael addition or conjugate addition). After protonation of the resulting anion intermediate, you get a new compound whereby the enolate carbon has been added to the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate.

To make sure the reasoning is clear here, the main product structure should be something like:

1. Nucleophilic attack on the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-COOEt) yields a structure where the cyclohexanone enolate (formed typically from the most acidic α-hydrogens, which in this case should be at carbon 6) reacts such that:
   
   The Michael addition product should typically follow this scheme where the enolate nucleophile attacks the β-carbon such that:
$$
\ce{(2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone) + CH2=CH-COOEt -> (2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-6-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)cyclohexan-1-one)}
$$

We need to make a more specific structure for compound A. First verify what compound A could be structurally. 

This reaction follows a Michael addition where the enolate formed from the ketone attacks the β-carbon atom of ethyl acrylate:
$$
\ce{RCH2COOR' + CH2=CH-COOCH2CH3 -> RCH(COOCH2CH3)CH2CH2COOCH2CH3}
$$
(Note: such a reaction is often followed by a decarboxylation if the ester group is at an alpha position to a carbonyl group, but here we need to instead understand the direct Michael addition product formed.)

However, for a more specific answer, the α-carbon of the ketone (either carbon 2 or carbon 6) should attack the β-carbon of ethyl acryalate such that:
   
The base t-BuOK abstracts a proton from an α-position (carbon 6 for our case) to form the enolate ion which attacks the β-carbon of ethyl acrylate such that:
$$
\ce{(2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone) ---t-BuOK---> Enolate (at C6) ->[\text{Michael Addition on}] Ethyl acrylate}
$$
Resulting compound may be:
$$
\ce{(2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone) + ethyl acrylate -> 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl-6-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)cyclohexan-1-one}
$$
Thus product A could be formed through such a reaction involving Michael addition where the enolate formed predominantly from the less hindered carbon (carbon 6 due to steric hindrance on carbon 2).

#### Step-by-step reasoning for Reaction 2: "1-nitropropane + (KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O) → B"

The question mentions "1-nitropropane" reacting with "(E)-but-2-enenitrile" in the presence of KOH and water. 

1. "1-nitropropane" has the structure CH3CH2CH2NO2 where the nitro group is on the first carbon (however, the actual structure has a nitro group on the terminal carbon, which means the α-hydrogens are on carbon 2 (CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2)).
2. "(E)-but-2-enenitrile" has the structure CH3-CH=CH-CN where the configuration is trans (E) about the double bond between carbon 2 and carbon 3. 

The reaction of a nitroalkane such as 1-nitropropane with a base like KOH leads to the deprotonation of the α-carbon (carbon 2 in 1-nitropropane) to form a nitronate anion:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH2-CH2-NO2 + KOH -> CH3-CH^- -CH2-NO2 + H2O}
$$
The intermediate anion formed here is a resonance-stabilized species called a nitronate anion where the negative charge can resonate:
$$
\ce{CH3-\overset{-}{\underset{|}{\overset{|}{\mathrm{\overset{-}{C}}}}}\overset{+}{H}-CH2-NO2 <-> CH3-\overset{\delta -}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{\overset{\delta -}{C}}}}-CH2-\overset{\delta +}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{\overset{\delta +}{N}}}}=O2}
$$
This anion can act as a nucleophile and undergo a Michael addition reaction with an α,β-unsaturated compound like (E)-but-2-enenitrile where the nucleophile adds to the β-carbon atom:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH^- -CH2-NO2 + CH3-CH=CH-CN ->[(Michael Addition)] CH3-CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CN)-CH2-NO2}
$$
Thus, the nitronate anion (formed from 1-nitropropane) will add to the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile such that:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH2-CH2NO2 + CH3-CH=CH-CN -> Intermediate ->[KOH, H2O] Product B}
$$
The addition product should be a new nitro compound where the nitronate anion adds to (E)-but-2-enenitrile such that:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH2-CH2NO2 + CH3-CH=CH-CN -> CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN}
$$
But if we assume the addition follows the Michael addition pathway where the α-carbon of nitropropane (which is carbon 2) adds to the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enonylnitrile such that:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH2-CH2NO2 + CH3-CH=CH-CN -> => CH3-CH2-CH(N^{+}O2^{-})-CH2-CH(CH3)CN}
$$
But further reaction might be involved such as decarboxylation or acid/base equilibria which makes us need to check the Michael Addition reaction products again.

Based on what Michael addition does here:
1. α-position of 1-nitropropane can be deprotonated by KOH.
2. The resulting nitronate anion attacks the β-carbon of CH3-CH=CH-CN.
3. The thus formed product would likely be:
$$
\ce{CH3CH2CH-(NO2)CH2CH(CH3)CN}
$$
However, we need to explicitly verify what the product structure turns out logically:

1. Initial deprotonation of 1-nitropropane:
$$
\ce{CH3CH2CH2NO2 ->[{KOH}] CH3CH^{\text{-}}CH2NO2 + K^+ + H2O}
$$
2. The anion reacts via Michael addition with (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH3-CH=CH-CN) where the anion adds to the β-position forming:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH^- -CH2-NO2 + CH3-CH=CH-CN -> INTERMEDIATE ->[H2O] CH3-CH-CH2NO2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CN}
$$
But here once an anion adds to CH3-CH=CH-CN, the negative charge should fill on the α-position such that:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH^- -CH2-NO2 + CH3-CH=CH-Cшлиcn -> CH3-CH2-CH(NO2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CN}
$$
(The structure should verify the new bond formed at the β-position of the but-2-enenitrile which could be designated explicitly as the carbon connected to the CN group should be the carbon where the new bond formed second.)

Thus, the answer choices should be:
1-Nitropropane + (E)-but-2-enenitrile under basic conditions (KOH/H2O) should produce a nitro compound where the α-carbon of 1-nitropropane (carbon 2) bonds to the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile forming a new carbon-carbon bond where the negative charge ends up on the α-position which later gets protonated from H2O.

Thus based on such a reaction scheme, the major product "B" should be:
$$
\ce{CH3CH(NO2)CH2CH2CH(CH3)CN}
$$

However, an acceptable structural product should be verified such that:
1. The product should retain the nitro group (NO2) because that is what reacts initially.
2. The alpha carbon of the nitropropane acts as the nucleophile which attacks the β-carbon of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

#### Conclusion and valuable results for "Major products":

1. For the reaction between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone and ethyl acrylate:
   The main reaction here is a Michael addition where the enolate ion from an α-position (carbon 6) attacks ethyl acrylate.

2. For the reaction between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and water:
   The nitronate anion formed from 1-nitropropane attacks (E)-but-2-enenitrile in a Michael addition reaction.

Based on these reasoning steps, drawing the final structures properly might require specific chemical structure drawing tools which depict the following:

1. For the first question:
Product A should be a compound where the enolate formed reacts with ethyl acrylate such
