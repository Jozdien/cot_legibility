# Original Question

Your colleague has devised a new quantum field theory on four-dimensional spacetime, and is exploring the regularization of certain higher-order loop diagrams in that theory. On their desk you spy a scribbled note: a Feynman diagram, and next to it, the words "size estimate" followed by a string of physical constants, numbers, and ratios between what appear to be energy scales. The symbols read: alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

The diagram, unfortunately, has been rendered unreadable by a spilled coffee. How many loops did it contain?

To solve for the number of loops in the given Feynman diagram described by the provided string of physical constants and ratios:
$$
\alpha^3 g^2 \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2,
$$
we need to break this down and understand what each component represents.

### Constants Overview:
1. $\alpha$: Usually stands for the fine-structure constant (usually $\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar c}$, often appearing in quantum electrodynamics), which is dimensionless.
2. $g$: Typically represents a coupling constant which is also dimensionless.
3. $\sqrt{2}$ and $8$ are numerical constants.
4. $\frac{1}{(4\pi)^6}$ is a numerical factor where $4\pi$ often appears in the context of angular integrations in $d=4$ dimensions (i.e., $4\pi$ is the solid angle of a three-dimensional sphere $S^24\pi$).
5. $\left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2$, where $Q$ and $M$ are energy scales such that the ratio itself is dimensionless.

To identify the order of the diagram in terms of loops, we need to compare the given expression to a generic $L$-loop diagram amplitude in a quantum field theory.

#### Generic Feynman Diagram Amplitude

The general form of a Feynman diagram amplitude can often be decomposed into a product of:
- Coupling constants (such as $\alpha$ and $g$ here), raised to some powers that depend on the number of vertices in the diagram.
- Numerical factors.
- A possible factor of $1/(4\pi)^{2L}$ where $L$ is the number of loops in the diagram (because $4\pi$ typically appears due to solid angle integrations).

To identify such a factor for a diagram with $L$ loops in $4$ dimensions, a common factor appearing in the amplitude is:
$$
(4\pi)^{-2L} = \frac{1}{(4\pi)^{2L}}.
$$
However, what we need here is to determine the factor $\frac{1}{(4\pi)^6}$ from the given question's string:
$$
\alpha^3 g^2 \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2.
$$

#### Using the $4\pi$ factor to solve for loops

Based on the generic prefactor $1/(4\pi)^{2L}$, it seems that the part of our given expression that depends on $4\pi$ makes us identify $1/(4\pi)^6$ as being such a generic factor such that:
$$
\frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} = \frac{1}{(4\pi)^{2L}}.
$$
Equating the exponents gives us:
$$
(4\pi)^6 = (4\pi)^{2L}.
$$
Thus:
$$
6 = 2L.
$$
$$
L = 3.
$$

So, the Feynman diagram that corresponds to the amplitude described by the given string of symbols should contain $3$ loops.

Another verification might be needed for the other part of the amplitude: the coupling constants are provided explicitly as $\alpha^3$ and $g^2$. However, the total strength of a vertex should be constructed from the couplings of the theory. If $\alpha^3 g^2$ describes the power of the couplings in the diagram, this implies there are three vertices proportional to $\alpha$ (thus three factors of $\alpha$) and two vertices proportional to $g$ (thus two factors of $g$). Although this does not directly tell us the number of loops, it confirms that the total coupling strength comes from five vertices (three for $\alpha$ and two for $g$). However, the question seems to focus on the power of $4\pi$ for the loop analysis.

### Answer Verification and Extra Validation

A Feynman diagram $G$ with $V$ vertices, $I$ internal edges (propagators), and $L$ loops follows the relation:
$$
L = I - V + 1.
$$
However, if there are two types of vertices (such as those associated with $\alpha$ and $g$), let $V_{\alpha}$ and $V_{g}$ be the number of $\alpha$ and $g$ vertices, where $V = V_{\alpha} + V_{g}$.

However, a more intuitive way to check the "strength" of a Feynman diagram is by using perturbation theory where the leading order part of the diagram amplitude typically goes as $\alpha^n g^m$ where $n$ and $m$ are the powers of the two coupling constants from vertices associated with $\alpha$ and $g$. 

However, what we need here is a direct answer for the loop number which seems to be what our question is primarily asking for. Based purely on the $4\pi$ power, it seems we've already concluded:
$$
\text{(Number of loops)} = \boxed{3}.
$$
Let us verify through a known structure such as $\alpha^3 g^2$. However, another part worth verifying might be the total power of coupling constants (including $4\pi$).

Typically, Feynman diagram amplitudes look like:
$$
\alpha^n g^m \cdot \text{(other constants)}.
$$
However, for a $n$-vertex diagram where $r$ vertices contribute a coupling constant $g$ and $s$ vertices contribute a coupling constant $\alpha$, the total coupling constant part should be $g^r \alpha^s$. Given:
$$
\alpha^3 g^2,
$$
this suggests:
$$
3 \text{ vertices contribute an } \alpha \text{ coupling constant} \text{ (so } V_{\alpha} = 3) \text{ and } 2 \text{ vertices contribute a } g \text{ coupling constant} \text{ (so } V_{g} = 2\text{)}.
$$
Total vertices $V = 5$. 

Another part of the question is that there can be external lines (edges connected to a single vertex which represent external particles), but that might not directly influence the loop count. 

Based on the standard Feynman rules for a diagram with $V$ vertices and $I$ propagators (internal lines), the loop number $L$ is given by $ L = I - V + 1$. 

Usually if there are $V$ vertices where $n_j$ is the number of lines meeting at vertex $j$, then:
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{V}n_j = 2I + E,
$$
where $E$ denotes the number of external lines. Another relationship is the previously stated $L = I - V + 1$.

However, we need an additional way to make a connection here. Another well-known fact is that given a combination of interaction vertices described by coupling constants (like $g$ and $\alpha$), the overall perturbation expansion order $P$ can be defined as the total number of vertices minus twice the number of loops (since for a $k$-th order vertex, if there are $n$ such vertices, the order including loop corrections might make us need an alternative formula like $P = \sum V_i - 2L$ where $V_i$ are vertices). However, an ordinary tree diagram without loops has $P = V - 1$. Consequently loops add an extra vertex for each one formed such that $ P = V - 1 + L$.

Another way to check our answer is through dimensional analysis (which usually makes sense only if the coupling constants are indeed dimensionless as in this case for $\alpha$ and $g$), and our question string only contains dimensionless products such that $\sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6}$ is purely a numerical factor.

Based on the given reasoning, the most confident conclusion we make based on the factor:
$$
\frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} = \frac{1}{(4\pi)^{2L}}, \text{ where } L=3
$$
thus a Feynman diagram contains $3$ loops should be a sound reasoning process. 

Thus, your reasoning leads us to:
The answer seems to be that the Feynman diagram contained $\boxed{3}$ loops.
