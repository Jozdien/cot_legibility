To solve for the decay of the $|3,0,0\rangle$ state to the $|1,0,0\rangle$ state in a hydrogen atom via two dipole transitions, we need to recall the selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen-like atoms. The selection rules are:

$$
\Delta l = \pm1 \quad \text{(change in orbital angular momentum quantum number)} \\
\Delta m = 0, \pm 1 \quad \text{(change in magnetic quantum number)}
$$

The hydrogen atom states are denoted by $|n,l,m\rangle$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number, $l$ is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number. Thus, the question states that the initial state is $|3,0,0\rangle$ and the final state is $|1,0,0\rangle$. 

The question requires us to find a two-step transition such that:
$$
|3,0,0\rangle \to |n,l,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle,
$$
where $|n,l,m\rangle$ is an intermediate state satisfying the dipole selection rules for transitions both from $|3,0,0\rangle$ to $|n,l,m\rangle$ and from $|n,l,m\rangle$ to $|1,0,0\rangle$.

#### Step-by-step Reasoning

1. Initial state $|3,0,0\rangle$ means $n=3$, $l=0$, and $m=0$.
2. Final state $|1,0,0\rangle$ means $n=1$, $l=0$, and $m=0$.

Let us identify the possible intermediate states $|n,l,m\rangle$. For the first transition $|3,0,0\rangle \to |n_1,l_1,m_1\rangle$, the selection rule requires $\Delta l = \pm1$. Given that $l=0$ for the initial state $|3,0,0\rangle$, valid values for $l_1$ are:
$$ l_1 = 1 \quad (\text{since } l_1=0-1=-1 \text{ is not allowed, since $l$ must be non-negative}).$$
Similarly, $\Delta m = 0, \pm1$, so $m_1$ could be $0$, $1$, or $-1$ (since $m=0$ in state $|3,0,0\rangle$). Thus, $m_1$ should be:
$$ m_1 \in \{-1, 0, 1\}.$$

For the second transition $|n_1,l_1,m_1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle$, the selection rule again requires $\Delta l = \pm1$. Given that $l=0$ for the final state $|1,0,0\rangle$, valid values for $l_1$ here must be one higher or one lower than zero (and again, $l_1$ must be non-negative):
$$ l_1 = 1.$$
Since $|1,0,0\rangle$ has $m=0$, for the second transition $|n_1,l_1,m_1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle$, the selection rule for $m$ requires $m_1 - 0 = 0, \pm1$, thus valid $m_1$ values here are again:
$$ m_1 \in \{-1, 0, 1\}.$$

Based on these two steps, any valid intermediate state $|n_1, l_1, m_1\rangle$ needs $l_1=1$. Note that the question implies that the only possible transition route needs to go through an intermediate excited state where $n$ can be any valid $n>1$ (since only $n=2$ makes sense for a two-step transition where $n=3$ decays to $n=2$ and then $n=2$ decays to $n=1$). However, what we need here is a valid $|2,l_1,m_1\rangle$ state where $l_1=1$ such that:
$$
|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,l_1,m_1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle.
$$

However, $|n,l,m\rangle$ need not only be $n=2$. Other viable $n$ values might be $2$ or higher so long as the second step transition goes back to $(1,0,0)$. However, it makes logical sense that $n_1$ should be values such that $n_1 < 3$ (since the transition needs to emit a photon thus decreasing energy which corresponds to decreasing $n$, so $n_1=2$ seems the most reasonable candidate for a two-step transition. 

However, another such $n=2$ state could be $|2,0,0\rangle$, however according to the selection rule discussion, the first transition should satisfy $\Delta l = \pm1$, so $|2,0,0\rangle$ cannot be an intermediate state. Thus, any valid intermediate state should be one of:
$$
|2,1,m_1\rangle \text{ where } m_1 \in \{-1, 0, 1\}.
$$

#### Valid transition routes:
1. $|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle$
2. $|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,-1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle$
3. $|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle$

However, any $2p$ state (i.e $|2,1,m\rangle$ where $m \in \{-1,0,1\}$) seems to be a valid intermediate state for the pathway $|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle$.

Another observation here is that the question should indicate which $2,1,m$ state is used explicitly. However, the question mentioned only one "route" which makes us question whether there is a single specific transition route which makes the most sense here. However, any state $|2,1,m\rangle$ where $m=-1,0,1$ is a valid candidate here. 

However, some states might contribute equally or similarly. To solve for the probabilities, one should typically solve for the transition matrix elements such as $\langle 1,0,0| \vec{r} |2,1,m\rangle$ and $\langle 2,1,m|\vec{r}|3,0,0\rangle$, where $\vec{r}$ is the position vector used in the electric dipole moment operator $e\vec{r}$.

However, we need to calculate probabilities here. To make a more standardized reasoning, recall that dipole matrix selection rules should heavily depend on the polarization of emitted photons (which relates to the $\Delta m = 0, \pm1$ selection rule where $\Delta m=0$ corresponds to linearly polarized light while $\Delta m=\pm1$ corresponds to $\sigma^{\pm}$ polarized photons).

#### Transition probabilities depend on the matrix elements such $\langle n_1,l_1,m_1 | \vec{r} | n_2,l_2,m_2 \rangle$. However, it makes sense for us to make a more generic description here:

1. The first transition $|3,0,0\rangle\to |2,1,m\rangle$.
    
2. The second transition $|2,1,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle$.
    
However, the total squared matrix element for a two-step transition can be expressed as proportional to:
$$
\sum_{m=-1,0,1} |\langle 1,0,0| \vec{r} |2,1,m\rangle|^2 \times |\langle 2,1,m| \vec{r} |3,0,0\rangle|^2,
$$
However, this is a complex computation that requires us to solve for integrals involving the hydrogen atom wavefunctions explicitly. However, typically, once the selection rules are satisfied, the major contributing factor might be the overlap integrals specific to transitions between $3\to 2$ and $2 \to 1$.

Based on the parity property, parity is given by $(-1)^l$, so the initial state $|3,0,0\rangle$ has even parity (since $(-1)^0=1$), the final state $|1,0,0\rangle$ also has even parity (since $(-1)^0=1$), while the intermediate state $|2,1,m\rangle$ has odd parity (since $(-1)^1=-1$). Thus, the two dipole transitions preserve parity overall (odd $\times$ odd = even).

However, another important thing to verify is that two dipole transitions make an electric quadrupole transition in second order perturbation theory. However, an electric quadrupole transition requires $\Delta l = 0, \pm2$. However, we need to make sure that what we're doing makes sense here where the question clearly states that the process goes through "two dipole transitions". 

To make sure which $n$ value fits well for the intermediate state, recall that usually most probable transitions are when $n=2$ for a $3 \to 1$ transition route such that:
$$
|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle,
$$
which makes sense energy-wise (since $3 \to 2 \to 1$ is clearly a stepwise energy decrease until reaching $n=1$). 

#### Selection rules make $n=2$ the only possible $n$ value for the first transition such that $3 \to 2$, followed by $2 \to 1$, satisfying $\Delta l = \pm1$ transitions both times where:
$$
\Delta l = \pm1, \quad \Delta m = 0, \pm1.
$$

Calculating the actual probabilities requires evaluating the dipole matrix elements explicitly:
$$
\langle \psi_{100} | \mathbf{r} | \psi_{210}\rangle, \langle \psi_{210} | \mathbf{r} |\psi_{300}\rangle.
$$
Other valid transitions such as $|3, 0, 0\rangle \to |2, 1, 1\rangle \to |1, 0, 0\rangle$ (or $m = 0, -1$) should be individually calculated for their dipole matrix elements such as:
$$
\langle \psi_{100} | \mathbf{r} | \psi_{211}\rangle, \langle \psi_{100} | \mathbf{r} | \psi_{210}\rangle, \langle \psi_{100} | \mathbf{r} | \psi_{21-1}\rangle.
$$

However, such calculations are typically complex and require detailed integrals. However, similar problems usually point us to normalized spherical harmonics and radial function integrations.

However, one important point is that the matrix elements should be checked whether any such $m_1$ values make a significant difference. However, usually, the $m_1$ values affect the photon line polarization rather than the total transition probabilities. Thus, the total probability for a transition through any $m = -1, 0, 1$ state should be summed up.

For instance, the total probability for $|3,0%\rangle \to |2,1\rangle$ can be computed as a sum of the probabilities for $m_1 = -1,0,1$:
$$
P_{3,0,0 \to 2,1} = \sum_{m_1=-1}^{1} |\langle 2,1,m_1| \mathbf{r} |3,0,0\rangle|^2,
$$
and similarly for $|2,1\rangle\to|1,0,0\rangle$:
$$
P_{2,1\to1,0,0} = \sum_{m_1=-1}^{1} | \langle 1,0,0|\mathbf{r}|2,1,m_1\rangle|^2.
$$

However, since the transitions need to obey the dipole operator $\vec{r} \sim Y_1^q$ (where $q=-1,0,1$) and depends on angular integrals such as:
$$
\int Y_{0}^0 Y_1^q \, Y_{l}^{m}\, d\Omega.
$$

However, for $3s\rightarrow2p$, the matrix element is:
$$
\langle 2,1,m_1| \mathbf{r} |3,0,0\rangle,
$$
and for $2p\rightarrow1s$ the matrix element is:
$$
\langle 1,0,0| \mathbf{r} |2,1,m_1\rangle.
$$

To solve explicitly for the radial part of the integrals:
$$
\langle n_1,l_1,m_1| \vec{r} | n_2,l_2,m_2\rangle,
$$
the angular integrals should be solved first. For two transitions $3s\to2p\to1s$, the total two-step transition matrix elements are obtained through second order perturbation theory where the "effective" matrix element for a two-step process can be described as:
$$
\frac{\langle 1,0,0 | \vec{r} |2,1,m\rangle \bullet \langle 2,1,m | \vec{r} |3,0,0 \rangle}{E_{300} - E_{21m}}.
$$

However, another important part of solving such a question requires us to check the non-zero condition for transitions such as:
$$
\langle \Psi_{n_1 l_1 m_1} | \vec{r} | \Psi_{n_2 l_2 m_2} \rangle,
$$
which splits into radial and angular parts where the angular part is:
$$
\int Y_{l_1}^{m_1*} Y_{1}^q Y_{l_2}^{m_2} \, d\Omega.
$$

Going through standard angular momentum coupling theory computations, the integrals vanish unless $\Delta l = \pm1$, so $3s\to2p$ and $2p\to1s$ are both allowed transitions. 

However, a well-known fact based on absorption or emission probabilities being proportional to the matrix element squared $|\langle 3s|r|2p\rangle|^2$ for the first transition and $|\langle 2p|r|1s\rangle|^\2$ for the second one. Thus, the most probable two-step transition route should be:
$$
|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle \ (\text{where $m$ can be -1, 0, or 1}) \to |1,0,0\rangle.
$$

This makes sense because:
$$
\langle 2,1,m| \mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{r} |3,0,0\rangle \neq 0 \text{ iff } l_1 = 1 \text{ (only valid state is $2p$ state where $l=1$)}.
$$

Therefore, the most probable two-step transition route appears to be:
$$
|3,0,0\rangle\rightarrow|2,1,m\rangle\rightarrow|1,0,0\rangle.
$$

However, the question should specify which $m$ state among $m \in {-1, 0, 1}$ should be used explicitly since all values of $m$ should be considered. However, all $m$ values should have a similar transition probability.

However, if we need a specific route, one could describe the transition route explicitly as follows:
$$
|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle,
$$
which seems appropriate. Another possible candidate might be:
$$
|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle,
$$
or:
$$
|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,-1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle.
$$
However, symmetric considerations might make us check that which $m$ value makes a difference might be negligible except for polarization.

From a well-known result in the hydrogen atom transitions between $2p$ and $1s$ states, the $2p \to 1s$ transition is quite strong. Similarly, $3s \to 2p$ is also a well-known allowed transition. However, such a question might need us to check further from the well-known $3\to2\to1$ transitions scale.

For probabilities, quantum perturbation theory provides us that the transition probability can be expressed as:
$$
\Gamma \propto E_{\text{photon}}^3 \left|\langle i|r|f\rangle\right|^2,
$$
where $|\langle i|r|f\rangle|^2$ is the squared matrix element for the dipole operator $r$. 

Finally, the identity might be used here such that:
$$
\langle 3s\to 2p\rangle \approx \langle 2s\to 2p\rangle \text{ (similar parity considerations but needs actual radial integration checks}). 

Another important part here is that the total probability found should correspond to the well-studied $n=3$ to $n=1$ dipole transition rate when $l$ changes by one unit at each step. 

However, the question might require us to solve two dipole transitions explicitly such that:
1. $3s\to2p\to1s$ is a valid "two dipole transition" route.

However, the question statement uses standard notation where another possible case seems to verify this "route" explicitly:
$$
|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle.
$$

However, such a transition should be represented explicitly as:
1. First transition is $|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle$ or $|2,1,-1\rangle$ or $|2,1,1\rangle$. 
2. Second transition is $|2,1,0\rangle \text{$or$ $2,1,1$ $or$ $2,1,-1$} \to |1,0,0\rangle$.

However, it makes equal sense that $3s\to 2p\to 1s$ is a valid transition route where $2p$ is the only intermediate state satisfying $\Delta l = \pm1$ for two steps such that $3s\to 2p$ has $l=0\rightarrow l=1$ transition and $2p\to1s$ has $l=1\rightarrow l=0$ transition. 

Thus, an appropriate binomial answer fits:
$$
|3,0,0\rangle \rightarrow |2,1,m\rangle \text{ (with $m \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$)} \rightarrow |1,0,0\rangle.
$$
Hence, the answer seems valid only for $n = 2$ as $2$, $l=1$, where $m$ can be any of $0, 1,$ or $-1$.

However, the only valid answer would thus be:
"The transition route is $|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,m\rangle $ (with $m
