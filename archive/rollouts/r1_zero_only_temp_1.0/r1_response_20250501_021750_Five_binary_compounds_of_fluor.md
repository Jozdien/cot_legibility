To solve for the question about five binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y, we need specific information given in the problem statement. 

Let $YF_n$ represent a binary compound of fluorine (F) with another element Y where $n$ is the number of fluorine atoms bound to one Y atom. Given that there are five known binary compounds of fluorine with element $Y$, let us analyze the given problem statement.

1. **"The bright-red substance $A1$ decomposes at 293 K into $A2$ ($\omega(F) = 31.96\%$) and fluorine."**
    
    The bright-red substance $A1$ decomposes at 293 K (which is approximately room temperature, 293 K ≈ 20°C) into $A2$ and fluorine (F$_2$). Given that $A2$ has a fluorine weight percentage ($\omega(F)$) of $31.96\%$, we need to identify what $Y$ might be such that one of its fluorides decomposes into another fluoride and fluorine at room temperature.

2. **"$A1$ oxidizes xenon under normal conditions."**
    
    "Oxidizes xenon under normal conditions" indicates that $A1$ is a strong fluorinating agent such that it can oxidize the noble gas xenon (Xe). This makes us think that $A1$ is a strong oxidizing agent and might be a higher fluoride such as $YF_n$ where $n$ is a relatively high oxidation state. Known strong fluorinating agents often used to oxidize xenon include compounds such as $PtF_6$$, which was the first compound that could oxidize xenon ($Xe + PtF_6 \rightarrow Xe^+[PtF_6]^-$), but there are also other strong fluorinating agents such as $KrF_2$, fluorides of metals in high oxidation states (such as $AuF_5$, $BiF_5$, etc.).

3. **"$A3$ can also interact with xenon. $A3$ is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine."**
    
    Another compound ($A3$) can also react with xenon. Moreover, $A3$ is obtained by directly fluorinating element $Y$ with fluorine. Thus, $A3$ is likely a binary compound formed directly from the reaction $Y + F_2 \longrightarrow A3$.

4. **"By adding $Y$ in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of $A4$, $A5$ can be obtained."**

    The compound $A5$ is formed through the reaction $Y + A4 \rightarrow A5$ where the molar ratio of $Y$ to $A4$ is $1:1$. For instance, this could be a reaction such as $Y + A4 = A5$.

5. **"In water, $A5$ decomposes into two substances."**

    $A5$ decomposes in water (hydrolysis reaction) yielding two substances (which might involve $Y$ and some derivative of $A4$).

Let us first solve for $A2$, given that it has a fluorine weight percentage ($\omega(F)$) of $31.96\%$. The compound $A2$ can be expressed as $YF_m$. Thus, the formula weight $M_{YF_m}$ can be calculated as follows:
$$
\omega(F) = \frac{m \times 19}{M_Y + m \times 19} = 0.3196,
$$
where "$19$" is the atomic mass of fluorine (F), $M_Y$ is the atomic mass of element $Y$, and $m$ is the number of fluorine atoms in compound $A2$. 

This implies:
$$
\frac{19m}{M_Y + 19m} = mixed3196,
$$
$$
19m = 0.3196(M_Y + 19m),
$$
$$
19m - 0.3196 \times 19m = 0.3196M_Y,
$$
$$
19m(1 - 0.3196) = 0.3196M_Y,
$$
$$
19m \times 0.6804 = 0.3196M_Y,
$$
$$
M_Y = \frac{19 \times 0.6804 \times m}{0.3196} \approx \frac{12.9276m}{0.3196} \approx 40.45m,
$$
which gives us:
$$
M_Y \approx 40.45m.
$$
This equation shows that the molar mass $M_Y$ can be estimated given a suitable value for $m$. 

However, $m$ should be small (since there are five binary compounds of $Y$ and fluorine, so $m$ ranges from $1$ to $5$ for instance). Let us try $m=1, 2, 3, 4$, and $5$.
$$
m=1: M_Y \approx 40.45,\\
m=2: M_Y \approx 80.9,\\
m=3: M_Y \approx 121.35,\\
m=4: M_Y \approx 161.8,\\
m=5: M_Y \approx 202.25.
$$
However, an element $Y$ such that $M_Y \approx 40.45$ does not make sense for $m=1$. An atomic mass close to $40.45$ would be calcium (Ca) with an atomic mass of $40.08$, but there aren't five binary fluorides of calcium. Another nearby element is potassium (K), with an atomic mass of $39.10$, which typically does not make five binary fluorides either. 

However, if $m=6$, $M_Y = 40.45 \times 6 \approx 243$. This brings us closer to another element: antimony (Sb) has an atomic mass of about $121.76$, but if $m=3$, this makes $M_Y \approx 121.76$, which seems plausible given that $m=3$ makes sense because $121.76 \approx 121.35$. 

However, another element that comes to mind here might be iodine ($I$, atomic mass $126.9$). Well-known binary fluorides of iodine are $IF$, $IF_3$, $IF_5$, $IF_7$. However, iodine has an atomic mass of $127$. 

However, analyzing antimony (Sb), which has an atomic mass of $121.76$, it makes several binary fluorides, such as $SbF_3$, $SbF_5$, and there might be other unstable fluorides such as $SbF_2$, $SbF$, though those are less common. Another candidate seems to be iodine (I), whose known binary fluorides include $IF_1$, $IF_3$, $IF_5$, and $IF_7$.

Another candidate might be bromine (Br, atomic mass $79.9$). For $m=2$:
$$
M_Y \approx 80.9,
$$
where bromine seems close. 

However, the question mentions that $A1$ is a "bright-red" substance. $BrF_3$ is a yellow-green liquid at room temperature whereas $BrF_5$ is a colorless liquid. For iodine, $IF_7$ is a colorless solid at room temperature. However, iodine itself is a violet solid or purple gas. 

However, one well-known bright-red substance that fits the description could be iodine monochloride ($ICl$), which is bright red, but $ICl$ is not a binary compound of fluorine. However, another compound that fits the "bright-red" description is iodine pentafluoride ($IF_5$) mentioned sometimes as a pale yellow solid or liquid (which seems a bit off). Alternatively, a well-known "bright-red" fluoride compound is bromine trifluoride ($BrF_3$), which is a pale yellowish liquid. Another red fluorine-containing compound is $BrF$, although it's quite unstable and decomposes easily.

Taking a closer look at iodine compounds, our previous reasoning seems a bit off. Another important hint here is that $A1$ oxidizes xenon (Xe) under normal conditions. 

As strong oxidizing agents, compounds such as $PtF_5$ can oxidize xenon:
$$
Xe + PtF_6 \rightarrow [Xe^+][PtF_6^-].
$$
However, binary fluorides that oxidize xenon are rare but include $KrF_2$ (square planar, colorless to white solid), which can act as a strong fluorinating agent. Another candidate might be compounds such as $BiF_5$, $AgF_2$, $NiF_3$, etc. 

However, $A1$ must be a binary compound formed only by $Y$ and fluorine where $Y$ is an element such that one of its binary fluorides decomposes at $293K$ to produce $F_2$ gas plus $A2$. 

Another compound that fits the oxidizing xenon is $PtF_6$, which directly reacts with Xe. However, $PtF_6$ is a dark red solid which makes $A1$ might be $IrF_6$, which decomposes at room temperature to $IrF_5$ and $F_2$:
$$
IrF_6 \text{ (red-brown solid)} \rightarrow IrF_5 + \frac{1}{2}F_2.
$$
Given that $IrF_5$ has a molecular mass of $281.21$, let us verify $\omega(F)$ for $IrF_5$:
$$
\omega(F) = \frac{5 \times 19}{192 + 95} = \frac{95}{287} \approx 33.1\%.  
$$

Another candidate could be silver which forms $AgF$, $AgF_2$. $AgF_2$ is a dark brown or black powder (not bright red) but acts as a strong fluorinating agent. 

Another compound that fits the decomposition description could be $BrF_5$, decomposing at room temperature might be:
$$
BrF_5 \text{(colorless liquid)}\rightarrow BrF_3 + F_2.
$$

Calculating $\omega(F)$ for $BtF_3$:
$$
M_{BrF_3} = 79.9 + 57 = 136.9,
$$
$$
\omega(F) = \frac{3 \times 19}{136.9} \approx \frac{57}{136.9} \approx 41.6\%.
$$
This does not match the provided fluorine percentage of $31.96\%$ for $A2$.

Let us verify $BrF_5$:
$$
M_{BrF_5} = 79.9 + 19 \times 5 = 174.9,
$$
$$
\omega(F) = \frac{5 \times 19}{174.9} \approx \frac{95}{174.9} \approx 54.3\%.
$$

Let us check iodine. Given $m=3$, $121.35$ aligns well with antimony which has an atomic mass close to $121.76$, while for $m=5$:
$$
40.45 \times 5 \approx 202.25.
$$
Seems close to the element bismuth (Bi, $M = 208.98$).

Another candidate which fits the statement for "five binary compounds of fluorine" is:
1. $BrF, BrF_3, BrF_5$ (only three binary compounds)
2. $IF_7, IF_5, IF_3, IF$ (four binary compounds)
3. $SbF_5, SbF_3, SbF$, where five binary fluorophores are not well-known (mainly $SbF_3$ and $SbF_5$).
4. Again, astatine could form multiple fluorides such as $AtF$, $AtF_7$, $AtF_3$, $AtF_5$, yet astatine is a highly radioactive and rare element.

Thus, significant candidates here might seem like $Br$, $I$, $Sb$. 

However, it seems we need another round of calculation validation based on what makes more sense. Let us try $SbF_3$ for $A2$, where $M_{Sb} = 121.76$:
$$
M_{ SbF_3} = 121.76 + 57 = 178.76,
$$
$$
\omega(F) = \frac{57}{178.76} \approx 31.9\%.
$$
This seems to match well with the given $31.96\%$ for $A2$.

Hence element $Y$ might be antimony ($Sb$). $A2$ could be $SbF_3$ while $A1$ decomposes into $A2$ and $F_2$. Thus:
$$
A1 \rightarrow A2 + F_2,
$$
$$
A1 \text{ (bright-red)} \rightarrow SbF_3 + F_2,
$$

The only binary fluoride of antimony which could possibly decompose into $SbF_3$ and $F_2$ is $SbF_5$. However, $SbF_5$ is a colorless liquid or viscous oily liquid. However, there seems to be another binary fluoride called $SbF_4$, which could decompose:
$$
SbF_5\text{(colorless)}:\qquad M_{SbF_5} = 121.76 + 5 \times 19 = 216.76.
$$
$$
\omega(F) \text{ for } SbF_5 = \frac{5 \times 19}{216.76} = \frac{95}{216.76} \approx 43.83\%.
$$
Another candidate could be an iodine fluoride such as $IF_5$, which does decompose above room temperature but is colorless or pale yellow.

Yet $A1_A \text{ (bright-red)} \rightarrow SbF_3 + F_2$, seems there might be a mistake in our reasoning here. Another compound such as $SbF_4$ might decompose similarly but it seems $SbF_4$ is not well-known:
$$
2SbF_4 \rightarrow 2SbF_3 + F_2.
$$
However, what is well-known is that $SbF_5$ reacts vigorously with water:
$$
SbF_5 + 2H_2O \rightarrow SbF_3 + 4HF.
$$

Hence, if $A2 = SbF_3$, what might $A1$ be such that $A1$ (bright red) should have higher fluorine content than $SbF_3$:
$$
A1 \text{ should be } SbF_5,
$$
But $SbF_5$ is not bright red. Another known compound among halides is $SbCl_3$, which is white solid. 

Based on known chemistry, only $BrF_3$ seems to somewhat match oxidizing xenon and decomposition into another fluoride plus $F_Y$.

Therefore, another element such as ruthenium might form binary fluoride $RuF_5$, which is a green solid. However, $RnF_5$ is labeled as a green solid which also darkens when heated. 

Taking another viewpoint where $A_2$ does have a fluorine content of $31.96\%$, we need to solve for which $n$ fits well here:
$$
M_{YF_n} = M(Y) + 19n,
$$
$$
31.96\% = \frac{19n}{M_Y + 19n},
$$
$$
0.3196 = \frac{19n}{M_Y + 19n},
$$
$$
0.3196M_Y + 19n \times 0.3196 = 19n,
$$
$$
0.3196M_Y = 19n - 19n \times 0.3196,
$$
$$
0.3196M_Y = 19n \times (1 - 0.3196) = 19n \times 0.6804,
$$
$$
M_Y = \frac{19n \times 0.6804}{0.3196} \approx 40.45n.
$$
Trying $n=1$, $M_Y=40.45$. No such element fits here perfectly round to $40.45$.

Trying $n=2$, $M_Y=80.9$. This is close to bromine (Br) having a molar mass of $79.9$, so Br might be plausible.

Trying $n=3$, $M_Y=121.35$. This is very close to antimony (Sb) which looks like a viable candidate too.

Let's check $n=4$, $M_Y=161.8$. This seems close to no familiar element.

Let's check $n=5$, $M_Y=202.25$. Might be interpreted as a round to $202.9$ for Thallium (Tl) which makes $TlF_3$ mostly.

Considering $n=3,$ element candidate could approximate to $121.35$, guessed as $Sb$:
$$
A_2\text{ might be } SbF_3.
$$
Let us verify when leap over $F\%$:
$$
\omega(F) = \frac{3 \times 19}{121.76 + 57} \approx 31.88\%.
$$
which closely matches the given $31.96\%$. 

Based on the information, $A2$ is quite likely $SbF_3$. Now let us identify substances $A1$ through $A5$.

#### $A2$ seems to reliably be $SbF_3$. 

We need another fluoride that decomposes into $SbF_3$ and $F_2$. Such a candidate could be $SbF_5$ even though $SbF_5$ decomposes mainly at high temperatures (and usually exists as a viscous colorless liquid). Another candidate needs to be a higher fluoride of antimony. These options seem limited.

Let us analyse if $A1$ might be $SbF_5$:
$$
SbF_5 \text{ (colorless or very pale yellow)} \text{ decomposes } \overrightarrow{\text{ at high temperature}} \text{SbF_3 + F_2}.
$$
However, $SbF_5$ is usually stable at room temperature.

Therefore, $A1$ could be another compound yet unknown.

However الظّن might be right that $A1$ is indeed $ SbF_5$. Yet the color doesn't match. However, considering $A3$ interact with xenon:

SbF_5.

However, $SbF再接辞职 prove沏 reacting with xenon means $A3$ might be $SbF_5$.
