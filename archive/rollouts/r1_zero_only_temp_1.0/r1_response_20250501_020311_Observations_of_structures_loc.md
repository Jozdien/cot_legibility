To solve for the observation of an absorption line detected at a distance of 2.1 gigaparsecs (2.1 Gpc) with an energy equivalent of 3.9 micro electron volts (3.9 × 10^-6 eV), we need to identify what part of the electromagnetic spectrum this energy corresponds to. 

First, let us recall some constants and conversion factors:
- The Planck constant $h$ is approximately $4.1357 \times 10^{-15} \text{ eV} \cdot \text{s}$.
- The speed of light $c$ is approximately $3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$.

The energy $E$ of a photon is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:
$$
E = h\nu,
$$
where $\nu$ is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave associated with the photon. Since frequency $\nu$ is related to the wavelength $\lambda$ by the equation:
$$
\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda},
$$
we can also express the photon energy $E$ as:
$$
E = h \cdot \frac{c}{\lambda}.
$$
We need to find the wavelength $\lambda$ associated with an energy $E$ of $3.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$.
$$
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E}.
$$
However, an alternative form for energy involving the Planck constant is often given in units of electron volts (eV) and wavelength in nanometers (nm), where the useful constant $hc$ (Planck constant times speed of light) is:
$$
hc = 1240 \text{ eV} \cdot \text{nm} \text{ (the product $h \cdot c$ in eV·nm is a well-known value)}.
$$
Hence, we need to solve for $\lambda$ where $E = 3.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$:
$$
\lambda = \frac{1240 \text{ eV} \cdot \text{nm}}{3.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}}.
$$
Calculating this:
$$
\lambda = \frac{1240}{3.9 \times 10^{-6}} \text{ nm} = \frac{1240 \times 10^6}{3.9} \text{ nm} \approx \frac{1240 \times 10^6}{3.9} \text{ nm} \approx 317.9 \times 10^6 \text{ nm}.
$$
Since $1 \text{ nm} = 10^{-9} \text{ m}$:
$$
\lambda \approx 317.9 \times 10^6 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m} \approx 317.9 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \approx 0.3179 \text{ m},
$$
which rounds to roughly $0.318 \text{ m}$ (or about $31.8 \text{ cm}$).

To make sure this matches with a part of the electromagnetic spectrum, let us recall some typical ranges:
- Visible light has wavelengths from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red).
- Ultraviolet (UV) has wavelengths from about 10 nm to 400 nm.
- X-rays have wavelengths from about 0.01 nm to 10 nm.
- Gamma rays have wavelengths less than 0.01 nm.
- Radio waves have wavelengths from about 1 mm to hundreds of meters.
- Microwaves typically range from 1 mm to 1 meter.

Based on our calculation, a wavelength of $0.318 \text{ m}$ (or around 31.8 cm) falls within the radio wave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Since radio waves have a wavelength range from about 1 mm (10^-3 m) to hundreds of meters, a wavelength of 31.8 cm fits well within this range.

However, the question mentions that the observation comes from a structure 2.1 gigaparsecs away. Another phenomenon that needs to be taken into account here is the redshift due to the expansion of the universe. However, let us first recall that the question states that the "absorption line" we detected might correspond to a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum when observed in the Milky Way (i.e., "locally" or at zero redshift).

The question thus requires us to infer what the "original" (i.e., rest-frame) absorption line might be if the observed line today corresponds to a line emitted earlier in the history of the universe where the object was 2.1 Gpc from us. The question implies that the observed absorption line (which has an energy equivalent of $3.9 \times 10^(-6) \text{eV}$ today) might need to be "blueshifted" so that what we observe here and now needs to be "unshifted" back towards what it might be if observed locally within the Milky Way.

However, what needs to be determined here is the redshift $z$ such that:
$$
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}} - \lambda_{\text{emitted}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}} - 1.
$$
The relation can also be written as:
$$
1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}}.
$$
The observed absorption line has an energy of $ E_{\text{observed}} = 3.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$ which corresponds to a wavelength of $0.318 \text{ m}$ or $31.8 \text{ cm}$ as previously calculated. However, what we need is to find what absorption line this corresponds to when observed within the Milky Way where there is no significant redshift due to the Hubble flow.

However, what we need first is to find $z$ using Hubble’s Law:
$$
v = H_0 d,
$$
where $H_0$ is the Hubble constant (which is roughly $70 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$, or $70 \times 10^3 \text{ m)/(s·Mpc)}$. However, a more commonly used approximate value here might be $65 - 75 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$, so we need to use $H_0$ to find $v$.

The question states that the observed structure is at a distance of $2.1 \text{ Gpc}$ ($2100 \text{ Mpc}$). Thus, the recession velocity $v$ can be estimated as:
$$
v = H_0 \times 2.1 \times 10^3 \text{ Mpc},
$$
since $1 \text{ Gpc} = 1000 \text{ Mpc}$.

Using $H_0 = 70 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$:
$$
v = 70 \text{ km/s/Mpc} \times 2.1 \times 10^3 \text{ Mpc} = 70 \times 2.1 \times 1000 \text{ km/s} = 147000 \text{ km/s}.
$$
This velocity should be compared to the speed of light $c$:
$$
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{147000 \text{ km/s}}{299792 \text{ km/s}} \approx 0.49.
$$
This suggests a significant fraction of the speed of light. 

However, for a more accurate handling of the redshift $z$ we need another form of Hubble’s law which is valid for larger distances where special relativity needs to be taken into account:
$$
z = \frac{v}{c} \text{ is only true for small $v$ where $v \ll c$}.
$$
However, in cosmology, for large distances,
$$
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}} - 1,
$$

However, an alternative form of Hubble’s law that works better for significant fractions of the speed of light uses:
$$
z + 1 = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{emitted}}}.
$$
Unfortunately, what we need here is a clear way to calculate $z$ explicitly from the distance $d$, which is given by a more accurate relation derived from the Friedmann equation. Another useful relation here is:
$$
z \approx \frac{H_0}{c} \times d,
$$
which works for $z \ll 1$. Since $v = H_0 \times d$, $ H_O \times 2.1 \times 10^3 \text{ Mpc}$ is the same as:
$$
z \approx \frac{70 \text{ km/s/Mpc} \times 2.1 \times 10^3 \text{ Mpc}}{300000 \text{ km/s}}.
$$
$$
z \approx \frac{70 \times 2100}{300000} \approx \frac{147000}{300000} \approx 0.49.
$$
But another part of the Hubble constant $67.4 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$ for a more modern estimate can be used here.
$$
z = \frac{67.4 \times 2100}{300000} \approx 0.4718.
$$
However, a more accurate way to find out $z$ for such a large distance might require us to work with Cosmological models. Yet, for a rough approximation, we need a value around $0.49$ based on $70 \text{ km/s/Mpc}$.

For $z \approx 0.49$:
$$
1 + 0.49 = 1.49 = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{\lambda_{\text{adjusted}}}.
$$
Hence:
$$
\lambda_{\text{adjusted}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}}{1.49}.
$$
Remembering that our observed $\lambda_{\text{observed}}$ was $318 \text{ mm}$ (accurate round should be $318 \text{ mm}$ which is $0.318 \text{ m}$):
$$
\lambda_{\text{adjusted}} = \frac{0.318 \text{ m}}{1.49} \approx 0.21342 \text{ m} \text{ (or } 21.3 \text{ cm)}.
$$

This is representative of a radio wave still. However, another well-known and significant absorption line in the Milky Way galaxy is the 21 cm line (which corresponds to an energy of $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \approx \frac{1240 \text{ eV} \cdot \text{nm}}{0.21 \times 10^9\text{ nm}} \approx 5.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$). 

However, we need to make a more exact check here:
$$
1240 \text{ eV} \cdot\text{nm} = 1240 \times 10^{-9} \text{ eV}m,
$$
so,
$$
E = \frac{1240 \times 10^{-9} \text{ eV} \text{ m}}{21.3 \, \text{cm}} \approx \frac{1240 \times 10^{-9}}{21.3 \times 10^{-2}} \text{ eV}.
$$
$$
E = \frac{1240 \times 10^{-9}}{0.213} \text{ eV} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}.
$$

However, it seems that our "adjustment" brought our observed line (which had an energy of $3.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$) closer into the neighborhood of another well-known $21 \text{ cm}$ line (which has an energy approximately $5.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$). Another round of calculating the energy for a $21 \text{ cm}$ wavelength:
$$
E_{21 \text{ cm}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV} \cdot \text{nm}}{21 \times 10^7 \text{ nm}} \approx 5.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}.
$$

However, this makes us question what the "original" $21\text{ cm}$ line ($21 \text{ cm} \approx 0.21 \text{ m}$) would appear like when observed from a structure at $2.1 \text{ Gpc}$ away. Let us reverse the reasoning and see how a $21 \text{ cm}$ line (rest wavelength) would appear when observed from a distance of $2.1 \text{ Gpc}$.

$$
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}}(1 + z).
$$
From our previous part, $z \approx 0.49$, so:
$$
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = 21 \text{ cm} \times (1 + 0.49) = 0.21 \text{ m} \times 1.49 \approx 0.3129 \text{ m} \approx 31.29 \text{ cm}.
$$

However, this matches well with our initial observed wavelength of $31.8 \text{ cm}$ if we round things a bit:

This makes us think whatever line observed here would correspond to a well-known $21 \text{ cm}$ line absorption feature if observed in the Milky Way. 

Based on this reasoning, what is most likely to be observed with an absorption line in the Milky Way having an energy equivalent of $3.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$ when detected from a structure $2.1 \text{ Gpc}$ away is:
1. If the question statement indicates that absorption line detected has energy equivalent $3.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$, which implies $31.8 \text{ cm}$ wavelength in radio waves which seems redshifted.
2. The "local" (Milky Way) version seems to be a $21 \text{ cm}$ line absorption (directly recognizable line in radio astronomy).

Thus, the answer seems to be that such an absorption line would most resemble the well-known $21 \text{ cm}$ line observed in the Milky Way.

Another option should be validated here for other absorption lines commonly observed in astronomy such as the Lyman-alpha line at around $121.6 \text{ nm}$ (UV region) or $H_{\alpha}$ line at $656.3 \text{ nm}$ (visible region).

However, if we recall back what part of the electromagnetic spectrum has more common absorption lines such as $656.3 \text{ nm}$ ($H_{\alpha}$ line in the visible range) or $121.6 \text{ nm}$ (Lyman-alpha in UV):
1. $656.3 \text{ nm}$ corresponds to:
$$
E = \frac{1240 \text{ eV} \cdot \text{nm}}{656.3 \text{ nm}} \approx 1.89 \text{ eV}.
$$
2. $121.6 \text{ nm}$ (Lyman-alpha line):
$$
E = \frac{1240 \text{ eV} \cdot \text{nm}}{121.6 \text{ nm}} \approx 10.2 \text{ eV}.
$$
These energies are far from the $3.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$ seen in the question.

Considering the answer should be the closest match ($21\text{ cm}$ line seems the most logical one):
Therefore, the answer can be verified clearly again as:
1. The observation here is in the radio wave part of the spectrum.
2. Therefore, the question should be interpreted as an observation where $3.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$ corresponds to radio wavelengths due to the redshifted hydrogen $21 \text{ cm}$ line.

Thus, the question most likely aims for an answer that "The $21 \text{ cm}$ line might be what is responsible for such an observation."
Our reasoning leads us logically toward an answer mentioning the $21 \text{ cm}$ line (hydrogen line).

However, $21 \text{ cm}$ line is commonly generated due to the hyperfine splitting of the hydrogen atom's ground state, where the spin of the proton and the electron align differently.

Based on such reasoning, what is most likely to be detected is:
1) The $21 \text{ cm}$ line generated by ground state hydrogen atoms.

To make a conclusion, the question seems to be pointing us to an absorption line which is usually detected at microwave wavelengths such as the $21 \text{ cm}$ line when observed in the Milky Way might appear already redshifted at $31.8 \text{ cm}$ from a distant object.

Answer: The $21 \text{ cm}$ line.
Another way to verify:
Since $21 \text{ cm} \rightarrow 0.068 \text{ GHz}$ frequency range is a well-known radio astronomy line for neutral hydrogen, any question regarding an absorption line detected should make us check such a recognizable line first.
Moreover, the question directly seems to ask what is "most likely" observed here locally corresponding to that observed line from such a faraway source.

Therefore, let us once again make sure we understand what the question is essentially asking:

1) First, identify what electromagnetic wave corresponds to the given energy of $3.9 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$ (which ended up being around $0.318 \text{ m}$ that falls in the radio part of the spectrum).
2) Second, you need infer what that observed line might be if it were observed in the Milky Way where there should be negligible redshift due to the cosmological expansion.

Hence, the answer should be:
1) The $21 \text{ cm}$ line (often referred as $21 \text{ cm}$ emission or absorption line from neutral hydrogen atoms in interstellar medium).

Thus, a well-structured answer should hence be:
The most likely observation in the Milky Way corresponding to the described absorption line should be the $21 \text{ cm}$ line for hydrogen.

Thus, the answer should be clearly listed as:

A possible answer could indeed be formulated explicitly as:
**An absorption line at a rest-frame wavelength of $21 \text{ cm}$.**

Thus, once again verifying:
1) The $21 \text{ cm}$ line is a well-known astronomical observational line used predominantly in radio astronomy for detecting neutral hydrogen (often called HI line).

Hence, answer should be:
The answer typically points toward something like:
"Observations will most likely be related to the neutral hydrogen $21 \text{ cm}$ line."
Which makes us verify that the answer should be considered here as the $21 \text{ cm}$ line is therefore a highly relevant absorption line candidate for such a question.
