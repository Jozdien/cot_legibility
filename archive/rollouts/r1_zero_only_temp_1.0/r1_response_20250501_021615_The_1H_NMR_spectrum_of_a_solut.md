To analyze the question, we need to identify the aromatic compounds listed and determine what their 1H NMR spectra would likely show, particularly focusing on the signals mentioned in the question:

Signals described in the question are:
1. Two signals at around 6.7 ppm for the aromatic protons (1:1 ratio).
2. Three signals at around 2.2 ppm for what appears to be methyl protons (2:1:1 ratio).

The question mentions that there is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds having the molecular formula C10H14. The candidate compounds mentioned are:
1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene
2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
4. 1,4-diethylbenzene

Let us verify the structural details and analyze the 1H NMR spectrum for each compound separately.

### 1. 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Durene)

**Structure:**
The molecular structure can be represented as:
```
    CH3
   /    \
CH3       CH3
  \        /
    CH3
```
The compound has a symmetric structure where there are two types of hydrogens:
   - Four equivalent methyl groups (CH3), which should appear as a single peak for methyl protons (typically around 2.2 - 2.5 ppm for aromatic methyl groups).
   - Two equivalent aromatic protons (on the benzene ring), which should appear as a single peak for aromatic protons (typically around 6.5 - 8 ppm).

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the 1H NMR should show roughly:
   - 1 signal for aromatic protons (singlet with a "1H" count of 2 protons).
   - 1 signal for the methyl protons (singlet with a "1H" count of 12 protons since there are 4 methyl groups).

This means:
- A single signal for aromatic protons (expected as a singlet due to the symmetrical structure).
- A single signal for methyl protons (also expected as a singlet).

### 2. 1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene (Isodurene)

**Structure:**
The compound can be represented as:
```
    CH3
   /    \
CH3       CH3
  \        /
   CH3
```
The compound has a less symmetric structure compared to 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. To identify the types of hydrogens:
   - Methyl groups: Three unique positions can be recognized here: there are two CH3 groups that are meta to another CH3 group (which thus might be equivalent to each other), and one CH3 group that is ortho to another CH3 group (thus making it unique).
       - CH3 group on position 1 (ortho to CH3 on position 2).
       - CH3 group on position 2 (ortho to CH3 on position 1 and para to CH3 on position 5).
       - CH3 group on position 3 has CH3 at position 2 as meta (1,3-position relation).

Counting the methyl groups:
    - CH3 at position 1 has two neighbors at meta positions (positions 3 and 5). CH3 at position 3 shares a similar environment except that it has a methyl group ortho at position 2 and another methyl group at meta position 5. However chemically, CH3 at position 1 and CH3 at position 3 should be equivalent due to symmetry (symmetry plane through carbon 4 and between carbons 1 and 5).
    - CH3 group on position 2 has a similar environment as CH3 on position 5 (due to symmetry through the axis that passes through carbon atom 4).
    - Thus, there should be one set of 2 equivalent methyl groups (1 and 3), another set of another methyl group (any two methyl groups which are not identical to the first set).

However, a more thorough symmetry analysis indicates that there should be two distinct types of methyl groups (1 and 3 might be equivalent due to symmetry, while position 2 is distinct from position 5 which might be equivalent to position 2). 

For aromatic protons, there is one aromatic proton at position 4 which makes a single signal for one aromatic proton should appear.

However, another symmetry analysis shows that 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene still has a symmetric structure where positions 1 and 5 are symmetric (thus CH3 groups at these two positions are equivalent), position 2 and position 3 should be symmetric as well so CH3 groups here should also be equivalent. However, CH3 at positions 1 or 5 are not equivalent to the CH3 groups at positions 2 or 3. Thus, there should be two types of methyl groups (CH3 groups on positions 1 and 5 are one set, while CH3 groups on positions 2 and 3 make up another set of equivalent methyl groups).

To verify:
    - The compound has only one remaining aromatic proton (one signal).
    - For the methyl groups, there are total four methyl groups where two are equivalent pairs such that:
    
Total signal distribution might be:
    - 1 signal for aromatic proton (singlet since only one aromatic proton left).
    - 2 signals for methyl groups (multiple methyl groups might appear as two signals where one is from two equivalent CH3 groups and another from another set of two equivalent CH3 groups â€” so a 2:2 split).

Alternatively, a more accurate analysis might show:
    - One peak for the aromatic proton should be a singlet (single aromatic hydrogen).
    - One peak for the methyl groups should be a 6H singlet (for three methyl groups which might be in two different environments where one CH3 might be on a "1,3" relation to another CH3 which should still show two signals for the methyl groups in a 2:2 or possibly 6:6 if one splits into two. 

This needs deeper NMR splitting patterns analysis but the question indicates that three signals at about 2.2 ppm appear in a 2:1:1 ratio. Thus, a compound should ideally exhibit three signals for methyl groups split into such a ratio.

### 3. 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene (Prehnitene)

**Structure:**
Compound can be represented as:
```
    CH3
   /    \
CH3      CH3
  \        /
   CH3
```

Here there are three types of hydrogens:
   - Methyl groups might appear in three sets where two methyl groups can be in one environment (1 and 4 are symmetric giving a 6H signal for methyl groups), another two methyl groups can be symmetric (2 and 3 make another 6H signal for another set of methyl groups). However, because all CH3 here seem to be in pairwise symmetric environments (1 and 4 are equivalent while 2 and 3 are equivalent separately), there appear to be two distinct sets of methyl groups which should give two signals.
   
   - Aromatic protons should display two aromatic protons which might be symmetric as well (at positions 5 and 6) which appears as a singular aromatic signal.

Total signal distribution for 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene should be:
    - Two aromatic protons make one signal.
    - Two signals for methyl groups (one for CH3 groups on positions 1 and 4, another for CH3 groups on positions 2 and 3).

### 4. 1,4-Diethylbenzene

**Structure:**
The compound can be represented as:
```
    CH2CH3
   /      \
            CH2CH3
```
Here there are three types of hydrogens:
   - A benzene ring has four aromatic protons which are symmetric such that there are two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons. Thus, one singlet could appear for aromatic protons only if the two sets of aromatic protons coincidentally have nearly equal chemical shifts such that they overlap perfectly.
   - CH2CH3 groups should produce signals for CH2 and CH3 groups where CH2 is usually closer to the benzene ring (deshielded, appears at about 2.5-3 ppm), whereas CH3 should appear at about 1.2 ppm.
   - Hence, the question statement mentions signals at "around 2.2 ppm" for what seem to be methyl protons but for diethylbenzene, the ethyl protons should be found at different chemical shifts such as CH3 around 1.2 ppm for the CH3 part and another signal for CH2 which should be at a higher ppm value but likely not called as a "signal around 2.2 ppm".

Total signal distribution for 1,4-diethylbenzene should be:
    - A signal for two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons, which could be two signals but might appear merged if the chemical environments are very similar.
    - A triplet for the CH3 group.
    - A quartet for the CH2 group (these should be at significantly different chemical shifts from 2.2 ppm).

### Question Recapitulation

The question states that there are:
1. Two signals at around 6.7 ppm (1:1 ratio). This implies that there should be one signal for one compound's aromatic protons and another signal for the second compound's aromatic protons where both signals appear separately such that each compound contributes one signal for aromatic protons, and each compound has a distinct set of aromatic protons such that the total aromatic signals appear in a 1:1 ratio (since there is a 1:1 mixture of the two compounds present).
2. Three signals at around 2.2 ppm (2:1:1 ratio). This indicates that there are three different signals for what appears to be methyl protons where two compounds contribute a total of three signals such that they appear in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Based on the reasoning above:
    
1. **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene** only contributes one signal for aromatic protons (one signal for the two equivalent aromatic protons) and one signal for the four equivalent methyl groups.
2. **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene** should likely contribute one aromatic proton signal (singlet for one aromatic proton) and likely two signals for methyl groups where there are two pairs of equivalent methyl groups.
3. **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene** should contribute one aromatic proton signal (singlet for two equivalent aromatic protons) and two signals for methyl groups where there are two pairs of equivalent methyl groups.
4. **1,4-Diethylbenzene** should contribute one or two signals for aromatic protons (two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons are usually close enough that they might be seen as one signal) and should contribute separate signals for CH2CH3 groups which should be at different ppm values.

The mixture needs to match two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Since the question mentions a "1:1 mixture," both compounds likely contribute unique signals such that:
- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes once signal for two aromatic protons.
- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one signal for one aromatic proton (but the question states two signals at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio which seems like each signal represents one unique type of aromatic proton from one compound).
- 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes once signal for two aromatic protons.
- 1,4-diethylbenzene contributes signals for four aromatic protons (likely two signals for two sets of two aromatic protons).

The three signals at around 2.2 ppm should be interpreted as:
- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes only one signal for all four equivalent methyl groups.
- Both 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would likely contribute two signals for their methyl groups grouped in symmetric pairs.

However, the question seems to be asking for a 1:1 mixture where the total aromatic proton signals observed are two signals at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio for aromatic protons. Another finding is that the question specifies there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm for what appears to be methyl protons where the ratio is 2:1:1. 

#### Conclusion

To solve for "3 signals at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio," one compound should provide two signals for its methyl groups where the signal intensities might be equal (i.e., split into a 1:1 signal pattern for methyl groups) while another compound should provide a single signal for its methyl groups. 

Given the argument that in a 1:1 mixture, if one compound has two signals for methyl groups and another has one signal for methyl groups, there should be three signals altogether. If one compound contributes one signal for the aromatic protons and another contributes another signal for its aromatic protons, there should be two signals for aromatic protons overall.

However, a new analysis leads us to:
1. 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (single aromatic proton signal and single methyl group signal).
2. 1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene seems likely to contribute two signals for its methyl groups where one might be a pair of methyl groups at positions {1,4} and another pair at positions {2,3}.

Thus, a mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and one of the other compounds might fill the question criterion:
1. **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene (one aromatic signal and one methyl signal).**
2. **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene should have one aromatic signal for a single proton or one signal for two protons if mistaken earlier, and two methyl signals (chemshift groups).**

However, what seems to make sense here is that a mixed signal for both aromatic protons as well as for methyl protons makes sense only if one compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) makes one signal for methyl protons while another makes two signals such that:
1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one signal for its four equivalent methyl groups (12H signal) and one signal for the two equivalent aromatic protons (2H).
2. Another compound should contribute two signals for methyl groups such that the total in the mixture is three signals for methyl protons in a 2:1:1 ratio. 


If we recall correctly:
1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has a single signal for the four equivalent methyl groups (12H).
   
   If mixed with 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which supposedly has two signals for two pairs of methyl groups (if one pair has 6H and the other has 6H as well, the signals might be in a 1:1 molar ratio total):

   Total signals for aromatic protons should ideally be:
   - 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one signal for two protons (at some chemical shift).
   - 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has one signal for one aromatic proton (different chemical shift).

   Total signals for methyl groups should be:
   - 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one signal at 2.2 ppm for 12H from four methyl groups.
   

Let us check if 1,2,3,5-tetrametylbenzene has:
   - Two sets of two identical methyl groups such that we need a total of three signals for methyl groups altogether from both compounds together. 

However, a 1:1 mixture means that if 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes one signal for 12H groups from four equivalent methyl groups (total integration of 8 from the number of hydrogens counted from the 1:1 mixture composition), one signal corresponds to 12H and if another contributes another two signals for 6H and 6H, what appears as a three-signal mixture might show peaks with integrations of 12:6:6 which when normalized could fit a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hence, such a 1:1 mixture could possibly result in a total of three signals for methyl groups where:
1. First signal comes from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene alone (total 12H).
2. Second and third signals might both come from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene if there are two distinct pairs of methyl groups.

Let us verify what aromatic signals we should get from a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (Durene) has two equivalent aromatic protons so contributes one aromatic signal.
   
2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has only one remaining aromatic proton so contributes one aromatic signal.

Thus together, they should produce two signals at ~6.7 ppm:
    - First signal for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (2 equivalent protons so signal integrates to 2H).
    - Second signal for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (1 proton so signal integrates to 1H).

The ratio of the two aromatic signals might be expected to integrate to 2:1 (however, the question mentions that the signals at 6.7 ppm are in a 1:1 ratio). Since there is a 1:1 mixture of the two compounds, what matters here is how many aromatic protons signals we detect. However, the question states that there are two signals in a 1:1 ratio for aromatic protons which means that either:
    1. They both produce single signals for aromatic protons such that both should have two protons.
    
However, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene only has one aromatic proton so the 1:1 ratio seems a bit off unless the question interprets signal "ratio" as referring to the number of signals themselves rather than integrating peak heights or intensity.

However, let us check what happens if we mix 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene with another tetramethylbenzene structure where aromatic proton signals might be contributed equally.

Consider a mix of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

1. **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:**
   - One aromatic signal for 2 aromatic protons.
   - One methyl signal for 12H (4 methyl groups).

2. **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:**
   - One aromatic signal for 2 aromatic protons.
   - Two methyl signals (6H for CH3 group on positions 1 and
