To solve for the reaction sequence described here, we need to break down each reaction individually.

**Step 1: Reaction of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide (forming product 1).**

Trans-cinnamaldehyde has the structure `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO` where `C₆H₅` denotes a phenyl group (benzene ring). An alternative name for trans-cinnamaldehyde is `(E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal`.

The reaction mentioned here is the reaction of an aldehyde with a Grignard reagent, specifically methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr). Grignard reagents act as nucleophiles attacking carbonyl groups such as aldehydes or ketones. The reaction mechanism typically proceeds via an addition where the carbon atom bonded to magnesium (effectively carbanionic due to the polarization between the Mg and C in the Grignard reagent) attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon.

The reaction can be described as:
$$
\text{(trans-cinnamaldehyde)} + \text{CH}_3\text{MgBr} \rightarrow \text{a product (1)}
$$
The aldehyde group (`-CHO`) in trans-cinnamaldehyde reacts with CH3MgBr such that the carbon from CH3MgBr attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde group forming an alcohol after a workup step (usually acidic workup, like adding water or a mild acid such as dilute HCl or H2SO4).

For reaction of an aldehyde (R-CHO) with a Grignard reagent (R'-MgBr), the reaction follows:
$$
\text{R-CHO} + \text{R'MgBr} \rightarrow \text{R-CH(OMgBr)-R'} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+,\text{H}_2\text{O}} \text{R-CH(OH)-R'}
$$
Thus, substituting R' as a methyl group (`CH₃-`) and R as `C₆H₅-CH=CH-` for trans-cinnamaldehyde (`C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO`), the reaction proceeds as follows:
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH-CHO} + \text{CH}_3\text{MgBr} \xrightarrow{\text{1) Et2O (usually)} \\ \text{2) H}^+,\text{H}_2\text{O}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH}_3
$$
The resulting product `1` should thus be `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃`. 

To verify the carbon count for product 1:
- trans-Cinnamaldehyde itself has a total of 9 carbon atoms (6 from the phenyl group, 2 from the vinyl group, and 1 from the aldehyde carbon).
- The reaction with methylmagnesium bromide adds one carbon from the `CH3` group (since `CH3MgBr` contributes a `CH3` group which is attached to the former carbonyl carbon). Thus, the new product should have a total of $9\text{ (original carbon atoms in trans-cinnamaldehyde)} + 1\text{ (from CH3MgBr)} = 10$ carbon atoms (excluding any loss of carbon atoms, which typically does not happen here).

Another way to verify:
1. The `C=C` double bond should remain intact unless there's a reaction that explicitly saturates it.
2. The carbon count for `C₆H₝-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃` is:
$$
6 \text{ (phenyl group)} + 1 \text{ (vinyl carbon)} + 1 \text{ (another vinyl carbon)} + 1 \text{ (formerly carbonyl carbon)} + 1 \text{ (methyl)} = 10
$$
This makes chemical sense because `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CHO` already has 9 carbon atoms (excluding the aldehyde carbonyl carbon as one of the 9), so adding a methyl group (`CH3`) makes it:

Total carbon atoms in Product 1 is a secondary alcohol where `1` is `C_6H_5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH_3` (which is called `(E)-1-phenylbut-2-en-1-ol`).

**Step 2: Treatment of product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (forming product 2).**

Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a reagent used primarily for the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones without further oxidizing aldehydes to carboxylic acids.

The substrate here is `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH₃`, which contains a secondary alcohol group (attached to a carbon bonded to another carbon (methyl group) on one side and a `CH=CH-C₆H₅` group on the other). Oxidation by PCC converts the secondary alcohol to a ketone:
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH}_3 \xrightarrow{\text{PCC}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH-CO-CH}_3
$$
The product `2` should thus be `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`, commonly referred to as `4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one`.

Let us verify the carbon count for product 2 again:
- The structure `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CO-CH₃` still has $10$ carbon atoms (6 from the phenyl group, 2 from the vinyl group, 1 from the carbonyl carbon, and 1 from the methyl group attached to the ketone group).

Total carbon atoms in Product 2 is thus still $10$ carbon atoms.

**Step 3: Treatment of product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature (forming product 3).**

The chemical name "(dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane" refers to dimethyl sulfoxonium methylide, which behaves similarly to a sulfur ylide analogous to dimethylsulfonium methylide (often referred to as Corey-Chaykovsky reagent). Another well-known reagent is dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, which is often used for epoxidation reactions (similar to the Corey-Chaykovsky reaction). Another well-characterized reaction of sulfonium ylides or sulfoxonium ylides is the reaction with carbonyl compounds such as ketones to form epoxides where `CH2` is added to the carbonyl compound such that the `CH2` group bridges onto the carbonyl carbon and oxygen (thus forming an epoxide when reacting with aldehydes or ketones).

However, one of the most well-characterized reactions of a reagent called "dimethylsulfoxonium methylide" (which seems to be described here as `(dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfanylidene)ethane`) is the Corey-Chaykovsky reaction where it acts as a methylene transfer agent. Another commonly used term for `(dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane` is the same as dimethylsulfonium methylide (another well-known reagent used for the epoxidation of ketones where `CH2` is added across the `C=O` bond forming an epoxide). 

Considering `(CH3)2S+-CH2` (methylating agent typically alters such that the `CH2` group adds to the carbonyl group, giving a three-membered cyclic ether called an epoxide). 

However, a more common reagent mentioned for such a reaction which adds a `CH2` group to a ketone might be `[(CH3)2S(O)CH2]-` (another version of a ylide). However typically ylides such as `Ph3P=CH2` (Wittig reagent) result in alkenes where the `=CH2` part replaces the `=O` part of the ketone forming an `=CH2`.

Based on this reasoning, the question mentions that product 2 (`C₆Hₛ-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`) is treated with `(dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane`. However, a likely reaction here might be a Wittig-like reaction where `(dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane` is regarded as a "ylide" where one unit of `CH2` is incorporated into the reagent itself "(dimethyl(oxo)-methylidene-λ6-sulfane)" should be $(CH_3)_2SO=CH2$. Another name for such a compound might be dimethyl sulfoxonium methylide.

Let us make a more accurate identification:
$$
[(CH_3)_2\text{S(O)═CH}_2] \text{ is indeed another well-known reagent called "dimethylsulfoxonium methylide".}
$$
The core transformation we need to analyze here is what happens when `dimethylsulfoxonium methylide` reacts with a ketone such as `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CO-CH₃`. 

The sulfoxonium methylide is a nucleophilic methylene transfer reagent similar to the well-known sulfur ylides derived from sulfonium ions (e.g., `(CH3)2S=CH2` where the central atom is sulfur +4 instead of +2 in `(CH3)2S=CH2`). Another well-known reaction using "dimethylsulfoxonium methylide" is the Corey-Chaykovsky reaction where it converts a ketone into an epoxide where the `CH2` group bridges the `C=O` bond forming a three-membered ring containing an oxygen atom called an epoxide.

Therefore, `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CO-CH₃` reacts with `(dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane` (dimethylsulfoxonium methylide) to form an epoxide where the `C=O` group is converted into a three-membered epoxide ring where the `CH2` group bridges the `C=O` bond. The reaction looks like:
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH-CO-CH}_3 + (\text{CH}_3)_2\text{S(O)CH}_2 \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH}\underset{\underset{O}{\mid}}{\overset{\overset{CH_3}{\mid}}{C}-CH_2}
$$
The product structure here should be alternatively represented as:
$$
4\text{-phenylbut-3-ene-2-one} + (\text{(CH3)2S(O)CH2}) \rightarrow \text{an epoxide with structure where the ketone carbon plus another carbon make a three-membered ring}.
$$
However, a simpler way to express product 3 here might be:
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-species-CH=CH-C}\underset{\underset{O}{\mid}}{\overset{\overset{CH_3}{\mid}}{C}-CH_2}
$$
We need to identify the total carbon atoms in the resulting product.

Product 2 had the structure:
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH-CO-CH}_3
$$
After reaction with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, the result might additionally include one carbon atom (from the `CH2` part of the ylide), so:
1. The carbon atoms already in `C₆H₅-CH=CH-CO-CH₃` total $10$ carbon atoms (6 phenyl carbons plus carbons in the `CH=CH-CO-CH₃` part which sums to 4 carbons).
2. The only part of the `(CH3)2S(O)CH2` that would be added to the main product is the `CH2` part (since `(CH3)2S(O)` is a leaving group). 

Thus, `CH2` should be added such that `CH2` bonds to the ketone carbon atom such that:
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH-TARGET}-CH_3
$$
where `TARGET` initially was `-CO-` (ketone group). The part that should remain after using `(CH3)2S(O)CH2` should be such that the carbonyl `C=O` group is converted into a ring where `CH2` adds across the `C=O` bond forming a three-membered epoxide ring where the carbonyl carbon is part of it. For the `C=O` group in `CH=CH-CO-CH3`, the `CO` part should become a `C(CH2)O` part where `CH2` is part of the resulting epoxide structure.

One part should be `CH(=O)CH3` converted into:
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH-C(CH}_3\text{)(CH}_2\text{)O}.
$$

However, an epoxide forms such that:
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH-}\underset{\;\;\;\;\underset{O}{\vert}}{\overset{\overset{CH_3}{\vert}}{\text{C}}}\text{CH_2}.
$$
This seems a bit complex to interpret. However summarizing:
$$
10\text{ (carbon atoms in product 2)} + 1\text{ (new carbon from CH2 part of reagent)} = 11
$$
But instead of simply adding another single carbon atom, another part indicates that the `C=O` group transforms into an epoxide where `CH2` connects to the carbonyl carbon such that:
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-CH=CH-CO-CH_3\xrightarrow{(CH3)2S(O)CH2} \text{C}_6\text{H}_5-CH=CH-}\underset{\underset{O}{\mid}}{\overset{\overset{CH_3}{\mid}}{C}-CH_2}
$$
Total carbon atoms should be:
$
6 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11
$
where:
- `6` from the phenyl group,
- `2` from the `CH=CH` part,
- `1` for the carbonyl carbon itself (which now becomes part of a three-membered ring where one carbon is part of the ketone group and connects `CH3` and `CH2`),
- `1` for the `CH3` group attached to the ketone carbon which still remains in the product,
- `1` carbon atom from the `CH2` part of the reagent that forms part of the three-membered ring.

Thus, the total number of carbon atoms in product `3` should be `11`.

Let us draw the expected product explicitly:
1. The part `COCH3` in compound 2 transforms into `CH3-C=C(CH₂)O` structure where `C-C` bond comes from carbon which initially was carbonyl carbon (which makes a part of the three-membered epoxide ring).
2. Hence atom count still checks correctly where "10 carbons from previous product" plus one additional carbon from the reagent makes total carbons $11$.

Hence, answer:

Product 3 has a total of `11` carbon atoms.

However, we need to make sure that all reactions make sense chemically. 

To verify again step by step:

1. **Trans-cinnamaldehyde structure ($\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{-CH=CH-CHO}$) has 9 carbons.**
$$
\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH=CH-CHO} \text{ (9 carbons)}
$$
2. **React with $\mathrm{CH_3MgBr}$ and acid workup. Product expected is $\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-CH(CH_3)OH}$ $\mathrm{(10\ carbons)}$ because $\mathrm{CH_3MgBr}$ adds a methyl group, so one carbon is added.**
3. **Product treated with PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate) which oxidizes a secondary alcohol to a ketone. Thus, product `1` $(\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-CH(CH_3)OH})$ becomes product `2` $(\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-COCH_3})$ which still has 10 carbons.**
4. **Reacting with "(dimethyl(oxo)-λ6-sulfaneylidene)methane" (dimethyl sulfoxonium methylide) brings us to a product formed by adding $\mathrm{CH_2}$ across the $\mathrm{C=O}$ to form an epoxide where the $\mathrm{CH_2}$ comes from the ylide itself such that the reaction is $(\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-CO-CH_3)}\,+\,(\mathrm{CH_3})_2\mathrm{S(O)} \mathrm{CH_2} \rightarrow\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH}-(\text{epoxide formed where $\mathrm{C=O}$ $\mathrm{CO-CH_3}$ part turns into a three-membered ring with another carbon added})$.**

Thus, the total number of carbon atoms in product 3 should indeed be `11`.

Based on our reasoning process, the answer can thus be validated once again as:
Total carbon atoms in product 3 should indeed be $11$.

Conclusion:
Answer should be:
\boxed{11}.
However, to illustrate what the specific reaction products might actually be named in chemistry:

1. Trans-cinnamaldehyde → `10-carbon` secondary alcohol after reaction with `CH3MgBr` and acid work-up.
2. This secondary alcohol gets PPCC-oxidized to a `10-carbon` ketone.
3. The `10-carbon` ketone reacts with dimethyl sulfoxonium methylide forming an `11-carbon` epoxide (because one methylene group (`CH2`) is added to make a three-membered epoxide).
