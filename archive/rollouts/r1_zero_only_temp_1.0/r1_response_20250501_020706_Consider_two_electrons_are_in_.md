# Original Question

Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$?

To solve for the joint probability of getting both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for the given coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$, we need to decompose the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ into a linear combination of uncoupled states $|l_1,l_2,m_1,m_2\rangle$.

Given $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$, where $l_1 = l_2 = 1$ and $l = 2$, $m = -1$, the coupled angular momentum state formed by two electrons (both with $l = 1$) can be expanded in terms of the uncoupled states $|l_1,m_1\rangle \otimes |l_2,m_2\rangle$, which can be written collectively as $|l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2\rangle$. 

The given state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ can thus be expressed as a linear combination of states where $|l_1, l_2, m_1, m_2\rangle$ such that $m_1 + m_2 = m$. For $m = -1$, the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs such that $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are:
$$
(m_1, m_2) \in \{ (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, -1), (-1, 1)\}
$$
which seems a bit redundant because $m_1$ and $m_2$ only take values in the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ since $l_1 = l_2 = 1$. Thus, the valid (non-zero) pairs are:
$$
(m_1, m_2) \in \{ (0, -1), (-1, 0)\}
$$
since $m_1$ and $m_2$ should be in the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, thus the only valid combination such that $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ should be verified through by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the reasoning here. Another condition we need to verify here is what values $m_1$ and $m_2$ can take given that $l_1 = l_2 = 1$. The standard set should be:
$$
m_1, m_2 \in \{-1, 0, 1\}
$$
Combinations where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ thus indeed include:
$$
(0, -1), (-1, 0).
$$
However, we need another valid check here which is:
$$
(1, -2),(0, -1)$, $(-1, 0)$, $(2, -3).
$$
However, $m_1$ can only be $1, 0,$ or $-1$, thus valid pairs are only:
$$
(0, -1) \text{ (with $m_1=0$ and $m_2=-1$)}, \\
(-1, 0) \text{ (with $m_1=-1$ and $m_2=0$)}.
$$
Using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, any coupled state $|l_1,l_2,l,m\rangle$ can be written as:
$$
|l_1,l_2,l,m\rangle = \sum_{m_1,m_2} \langle l_1, m_1, l_2, m_2 \mid l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle |l_1, m_1\rangle \otimes |l_2, m_2\rangle.
$$
However, a more convenient way to write this is:
$$
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = \alpha \mid 1,0\rangle \otimes \mid 1,-1\rangle + \beta \mid 1,-1\rangle \otimes \mid 1,0\rangle,
$$
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for transforming from the $|l_1,l_2,m_1,m_2\rangle$ basis to the $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle$ basis. However, by symmetry (since $l_1 = l_2$, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are symmetric in the two terms except for the order of $m_1$ and $m_2$), the expansion should contain all valid $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ pairs such that $m_1, m_2 \in \{-1,0,1\}$. 

So, let us make use of the Clebsch-Gordan tables for coupling two $l=1$ angular momenta such that $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. The allowed values range from $|l_1 - l_2|$ to $l_1 + l_2$. Thus here, $l$ ranges from $0$ to $2$, such that $l=0, 1,$ or $2$.

Let us recall the Clebsch-Gordan series here:
$$
l_1 \otimes l_2 = |l_1 - l_2|, \ldots, l_1+ l_2,
$$
so:
$$
1 \otimes 1 = 0 \oplus 1 \oplus 2.
$$

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for $l_1 = l_2 = l = 1$ are defined such that:
$$
|l_1,l_2,l,m\rangle = \sum_{m_1,m_2}C(l_1,l_2,l;m_1,m_2,m)|l_1,m_1\rangle|l_2,m_2\rangle,
$$
where $C(l_1,l_2,l;m_1,m_2,m)$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\langle l_1,l_2,m_1,m_2\mid l_1,l_2,l,m\rangle$. Looking specifically for the $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ state, we need to find the coefficients for all $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that $m_1 + $m_2 = $m$ where $m=-1$ here.

According to Clebsch-Gordan tables for $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$:
$$
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = \alpha|1,0\rangle \otimes |1,-1\rangle + \beta|1,-1\rangle \otimes |1,0\rangle,
$$
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coefficients such that $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. 

Note that:
$$
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = C_1 \cdot |1, 0\rangle|1, -1\rangle + C_2 \cdot |1, -1\rangle|1, 0\rangle.
$$
The symmetry properties of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients tell another part here such that:
$$
C_1 = C_{1,0,1,-1}^{112,-1} \text{ and } C_2 = C_{1,-1,1,0}^{112,-1}.
$$
The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be found from the relevant table or computed explicitly from the Wigner 3-j symbols. 

However, a well-known reference for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients gives us:
$$
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}|1,0\rangle|1,-1\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}|1,-1\rangle|1,0\rangle,
$$
where the distributions are symmetric for $|1,0\rangle|1,-1\rangle$ and $|1,-1\rangle|1,0\rangle$.

However, more rigorously, the Clebsch-Gordan table for $1 \otimes 1 \rightarrow 2$ states that:
$$
|2,2\rangle = |1,1\rangle|1,1\rangle,
$$
$$
|2,1\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \left(|1,0\rangle|1,1\rangle + |1,1\rangle|1,0\rangle\right),
$$
$$
|2,0\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{6}} \left(|1,1\rangle|1,-1\rangle + 2|1,0\rangle|1,0\rangle + |1,-1\rangle|1,1\rangle\right),
$$
$$
|2,-1\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \left(|1,-1\rangle|1,0\rangle + |1,0\rangle|1,-1\rangle\right),
$$
$$
|2,-2\rangle = |1,-1\rangle|1,-1\rangle,
$$

So,
$$
|2,-1\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} (|1,0\rangle_1|1,-1\rangle_2 + |1,-1\rangle_1|1,0\rangle_2).
$$
However, what we desire is finding the joint probability for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{_{12}}$ eigenstates to be $-\hbar$. This means $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. 

However, from our decomposition of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$, the only terms that appear are $|1,0\rangle|1,-1\rangle$ and $|1,-1\rangle|1,0\rangle$. Note that $(-1,0)$ and $(0,-1)$ are both present with a coefficient of $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$. However, the question asks for the joint probability that $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$, which means $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, which makes the state $|1, -1\rangle|1, -1\rangle$. 

However, the linear combination for $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not contain the term $|1,-1\rangle \otimes |1,-1\rangle$. That term appears only in the $|2,-2\rangle$ state which is $|1,1,2,-2\rangle$, such that:
$$
|1,1,2,-2\rangle = |1,-1\rangle \otimes |1,-1\rangle.
$$
Thus explicitly looking for the state $|1,-1\rangle \otimes |1,-1\rangle$ in $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$:
$$
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}(|1,0\rangle|1,-1\rangle + |1,-1\rangle|1,0\rangle).
$$
So, the linear combination only includes:
$$
\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}|1,0\rangle\otimes|1,-1\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}|1,-1\rangle\otimes|1,0\rangle.
$$

To find the joint probability that $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ ($m_1 = -1$) and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ ($m_2 = -1$), what we need is the coefficient or amplitude for:
$$
|1,-1\rangle \otimes |1,-1\rangle,
$$
which should be zero since it is not part of the decomposition of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Thus, the joint probability is:
$$
\mathbb{P}(L_{1z}=-\hbar \text{ and } L_{2z}=-\hbar) = 0.
$$
However, what we need might require us to confirm our reasoning explicitly. Another representation of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ is thus:
$$
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} |1,0\rangle_1|1,-1\rangle_2 + \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}|1,-1\rangle_1|1,0\rangle_2.
$$
This indicates two possible outcomes when measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$:
1. Probability that $L_{1z}=0$ (hence eigenvalue $0\cdot\hbar$) and $L_{2z}=-1$ (hence eigenvalue $-\hbar$):
$$
\left|\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\right|^2 = \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
$$
And the outcome here is $m_1 = 0$, $m_2 = -1$.

2. Probability that $L_{1z}=-1$ (hence eigenvalue $-\hbar$) and $L_{2z}=0$ (hence eigenvalue $0\cdot\hbar$):
$$
\left|\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\right|^2 = \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
$$
And the outcome here is $m_1 = -1$, $m_2 = 0$.

However, as we need the joint probability where $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, which means that both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{_{2z}}$ should be $-\hbar$.

Thus, since the only two outcomes spanned are $(0,-1)$ or $(-1,0)$, the joint probability that $L_{1z}$ yields $-\hbar$ at the same time $L_{2z}$ yields $- \hbar$ is therefore apparently zero if defined properly from the given state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$.

Another way to confirm it explicitly is by analyzing the state $|1,-1\rangle \otimes |1,-1\rangle$. Since $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, the total $m = -2$, which is incompatible with the $m = -1$/ component total angular momentum $2$ state described here. Thus, there is no contribution for such a state.

Based on the reasoning above, the joint probability of measuring values such that $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ (i.e. $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$) seems to be $0$.

To make sure that $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not contain any part that corresponds to $|1,-1\rangle_1|1,-1\rangle_2$, so:
$$
\boxed{0}.
$$
This reasoning makes sense because $|1,1,2,-2\rangle$ is the only state where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, which makes its total $m = -2$.

However, one should make a double check where any state $|1,-1\rangle|1,-1\rangle$ is orthogonal to $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$:
$$
\langle 1,1,2,-1|1,-1\rangle |1,-1\rangle = 0,
$$
hence no contribution makes the joint probability zero.

To make sure one understands what the question is asking for, the question asks for the "joint probability" such that:
1) Measurement yields $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$.
2) Measurement yields $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ which corresponds to $m_2 = -1$.

So, $m_1 + m_2 = -1 + (-1) = -2$, which does not fit the total $m = -1$ for the state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Thus zero probability seems to be the right answer.
