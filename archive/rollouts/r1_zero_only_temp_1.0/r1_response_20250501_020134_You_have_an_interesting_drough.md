# Original Question

You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

To solve this, we need to understand what the question is asking us first. The question states that there is a drought-resistant cultivar of barley that contains an anti-nutritional compound due to a specific gene composed of five exons and four introns. The goal is to identify which of the provided mutations would most probably allow us to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound produced by this gene.

First, let us recall that a gene consists of coding regions called exons and non-coding regions called introns. The question indicates that the gene in question has “five exons and four introns.” However, what matters here specifically seems to be the "sequence at the beginning ... in the first exon area," which means we need to analyze the parts of the given gene sequences that correspond to the first exon.

The given "intact gene" sequence is:
```
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA-3’
```

Note that the question mentions mutations detected in the "first exon area." The first part of a gene's first exon usually contains the start codon, which is typically "ATG" (which codes for the amino acid methionine and signifies the start of translation).

Another important part of the genomic sequence is the stop codon (such as TGA, TAG, or TAA). However, in this case, the problem statement mentions that "...TGA-3’" signifies the end of the sequence displayed here (which might be part of an exon or an intron, but we need to verify if any of the mutations significantly alter the protein encoded by the gene).

To identify which mutation most probably allows us to "eliminate the anti-nutritional compound," a mutation should likely disrupt the normal function of the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. Mutations that might do this include:
1. Mutations that cause a frameshift mutation leading to an early stop codon or a completely different protein sequence.
2. Mutations that introduce a premature stop codon early in the first exon (nonsense mutation).

Given this, let us compare the "intact gene" sequence with the provided mutated sequences.

#### Intact gene sequence:
5’-ATG **TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT** … TGA-3'

#### Mutant 1:
5’-ATG **TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC** … TGA-3'
- By comparing base by base with the intact gene sequence (starting from the second base after the ATG):
    - Original: `TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …`
    - Mutant 1: `TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …`
    - First difference: The second triplet changes from `TTT` (Phe) to `TTC` (again Phe, which is a synonymous mutation — same amino acid).
    - Second triplet changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr).
    - The last triplet changes from `CGT` (Arg) to `CGC` (again Arg, another synonymous mutation).
    
Thus, mutant 1 only has one amino acid change (Leu to Tyr) in the second triplet after the start codon.

#### Mutant 2:
5’-ATG **TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC** … TGA-3'
- By comparing base by base from the second base after the ATG:
    - Original: `TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …`
    - Mutant 2: `TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …`
    - First difference shows that `TTT` changed to `TTC` (synonymous mutation for Phe).
    - Second triplet changed from `CTC` to `TAA`.
    
`TAA` is a stop codon. Thus, if the second triplet after the start codon is a stop codon, this could cause premature termination of translation, potentially significantly disrupting the protein function.

#### Mutant 3:
5’-ATG **TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT** … TGA-3'
- By comparing base by base after the ATG:
    - Original: `TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …`.
    - Mutant 3: `TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …`.
    
    Notice that there appears to be an extra nucleotide inserted ("GTC ACT" instead of just "ACT"), which requires a more careful comparison here:
    - First triplet changes from `TTT` (Phe) to `TTT` (no change).
    - Second triplet should be `CTC`, but it appears that `TTC` should be compared properly here. However, `TAC` is given instead of `CTC` - which means `CTC → TAC` (Leu → Tyr).
    - Third triplet `GCT` stays `GCT` (no change).
    - Fourth triplet `GGT` stays till `GGT` (no change).
    - However, there appears to be an extra triplet inserted here ("GTC" inserted after "GGT").
    - This makes part of the sequence "GGT GTC ACT" where originally only "GGT ACT" existed. This seems to indicate an insertion of two bases ("TG") after the first "G" of `GGT`.
        - Verification:
            - Sequence after `ATG`: `TTT (TCG -> mutates -> TAC) CTG GT(ACT -> mutates -> GTC) ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …`

To make a more robust frame-by-frame comparison for part of mutant 3 sequence:
    - Intact gene reads (excluding the first `ATG`) in triplets after `ATG`:
        - `TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT`
        - Which translates to amino acids:
        - ATG (Met) - TTT (Phe) - CTC (Leu) - GCT (Ala) - GGT (Gly) - ACT (Thr) - TCT (Ser)...
    - Mutant 3 sequence appears as:
        - `TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT`
        - Which translates to amino acids:
        - ATG (Met) - TTT (Phe) - TAC (Tyr) - GCT (Ala) - GGT (Gly) - GTC (Val) - ACT (Thr)                                                                - TCT (Ser)...
This shows an insertion ("GTC") might be a part of an extra base inserted after `GGT`.

However, this appears to be a mistake in our parsing or description. Another closer look seems needed here. Another possible approach here is to verify the correct reading frame should still be preserved rather than a frameshift mutation because the sequence ends normally with `TGA`. However, a frameshift mutation might make a more drastic alteration compared to a missense one.

#### Mutant 4:
5’-ATG **TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GAG GAT GAACATATT TAT TGT CGT** … TGA-3'
- By comparing base by base after the ATG:
    - Original: `TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …`
    - Mutant 4: `TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…`
    
    However, there seems to be a deletion in mutant 4 where some bases are missing ("GGT" is missing right after "GCT"):
    - After `ATG`, the original reads `TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT`, whereas mutant 4 appears to be `TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG`, missing the `GGT`. Thus `GGT` (encoding amino acid Gly) is deleted here which causes a frameshift if indeed `GGT` is deleted.

The main question here is which mutation would most likely disrupt the function of the gene such that the anti-nutritional compound is not produced. 

1. Mutant 1 has a single amino acid change (Leu to Tyr).
2. Mutant 2 has a stop codon (TAA) early in the first exon, which would likely cause premature termination of translation and thus disrupt the protein function.
3. Mutant 3 seems to have a potential insertion which might cause a frameshift if there is indeed an insertion of an extra nucleotide (which seems a bit unclear but seems like it contains an extra triplet "GTC" inserted after "GGT," yet it might need careful checking).
4. Mutant 4 appears to have a deletion ("GGT" seems to be missing), which might cause a frameshift mutation.

However, it seems that `Mutant 2` would be most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound because it introduces a stop codon very early in the gene sequence (TAA after the first single codon change from TTC which keeps Phe as Phe). The presence of a stop codon so early in the gene sequence suggests that translation would stop almost immediately after it starts, which would result in a truncated protein that is likely nonfunctional. 

However, we need to make sure that the "TGA" mentioned at the end of the sequence for all genes is part of the question statement and not part of the actual gene sequence until you reach that point. Another issue might be the actual sequence alignment should be double-checked properly such that "ATG" is the start codon indicating the beginning of the protein coding sequence.

Thus, a truncating mutation such as an early stop codon in Mutant 2 appears most likely to make the protein non-functional and thus might “eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.”

Based on this reasoning, the answer should thus be:
Mutant 2.

Verifying the reasoning for frameshift mutations:
1. Mutant 4 also appears to have a deletion ("GGT" triplet), which could indeed cause a frameshift if the actual deletion is not a multiple of three bases (which we need to confirm if `GGTACT` becomes `TACACT` here). However, it seems that mutant 4 might be interpreted as:
    - `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`:
        - Directly after ATG, it looks like `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’`.
        - From `TTT TAC GCT` to `ATGTTT(CTC->TAC)GCT(GGT->deleted)ACTTCTGTG...`
    
Mutant 3 seems like a potential error in the question statement as there seems to be a typo implying an insertion of bases such that the statement does not make it clear what part of the mutant 3 sequence corresponds to the `GGT ACT TCT` part of the original gene.

However, a premature stop codon is usually a very strong disruption. Another important part of `Mutant 2` is that any mutation that severely truncates the protein product should make the protein non-functional. Hence once again, `Mutant 2` seems to be the strongest candidate here.

Answer should indeed be:
Mutant 2

Alternatively, a more straightforward way to check mutations is if any introduce a premature stop codon (as in Mutant 2) early in the exon sequence. From the provided choices, only Mutant 2 includes a stop codon "TAA" early in the gene sequence (which makes Mutant 2 a good candidate for disrupting the gene function effectively).

This makes the answer choice thus:
**Mutant 2.**
However, a stop codon is a single point mutation making it a robust candidate compared to a frameshift mutation which requires a more careful check on reading frame alignment. Hence, it seems that you need to identify a mutation that makes the gene dysfunctional. 

Another potential candidate might be a frameshift mutation such as mutant 4 where a deletion makes the reading frame shift which might end up making a completely different amino acid sequence or a premature stop codon might appear later. However, mutant 2 makes it clear that a stop codon appears very early on so it seems that any stop codon should make a truncated nonfunctional protein which seems quite straightforward.

Based on the question statement and reasoning, the answer thus seems clearly:
**Mutant 2** seems to be the most probable candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound by introducing an early stop codon which truncates the protein sequence.

Based on what appears to be a valid reasoning process, this makes `Mutant 2` the candidate answer.

You should interpret the question context such that:
1. The gene needs some part disrupted.
2. `Mutant 2` appears to make a "premature stop codon" within exon 1.

However, let's verify again if our translations make sense explicitly.

For the "intact gene" sequence we need to interpret the part right after ATG until the next part mentioned:
```
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Met Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr Ser Val Asp Glu His Ile Tyr Cys Arg … Stop
```

For Mutant 1:
```
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA
Met Phe Tyr Ala Gly Thr Ser Val Asp Glu His Ile Tyr Cys Arg … Stop
```

This only replaces `Leu` (CTC) to `Tyr` (TAC) at the third amino acid position (second after methionine).

For Mutant 2:
```
ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA
Met Phe STOP
```

This introduces a STOP codon (TAA) right after the second amino acid (Phe encoded by `TTC`), so translation would likely stop there, making a very short peptide "Met-Phe" only.

For Mutant 3:
There seems to be a potential mistake in the question because there seems to be an extra "GTC" inserted:
```
ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Met Phe Tyr Ala Gly Val Thr Ser Val Asp Glu His Ile Tyr Cys Arg … Stop
```

This one seems to have an insertion of a "GTC" (which makes "Val") between "GGT" (Gly) and "ACT" (Thr).
Seems that `GTC ACT` should instead normally be `ACT`, so this looks like an extra three nucleotides added ("GTC"), which makes it a single amino acid (Val) insertion in the protein sequence.

For Mutant 4:
Seems like `GGT` is missing:
```
ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Met Phe Tyr Ala Thr Ser Val Asp Glu His Ile Tyr Cys Arg … Stop
```

Seems that `GGT` (encoding Gly) is deleted here. Hence:
`ATG TTT TTG CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG` becomes `ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG`.

Determining which one would make the gene fail to produce a functional protein such that the compound is not synthesized:
1. Mutant 2 makes a very short polypeptide because of an early stop codon which seems like a strong candidate.
2. Mutant 1 has a single amino acid change which might not completely disrupt the protein function.
3. Mutant 3 has an amino acid inserted ("Val") which might affect protein structure but might not make the protein nonfunctional.
4. Mutant 4 has a deletion of one triplet (three nucleotides) which means no frameshift occurs but one amino acid (Gly) is deleted which might affect protein structure but might not make it nonfunctional.

Based on this reasoning once again, `Mutant 2` seems to be the answer that would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound due to the early protein termination.
