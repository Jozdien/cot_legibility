To solve for the reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene treated with Grubbs catalyst (which is commonly used for olefin metathesis), we need to identify the reactants and the type of reaction involved. 

Grubbs catalyst facilitates the olefin metathesis reaction where two alkenes exchange parts of their carbon chains. The question mentions that we are treating "racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene" with Grubbs catalyst such that the products exclude ethene.

To make reasoning easier, we need to write down the structure of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. 

3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure:
$$\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_3}$$
However, there is a chiral center at the third carbon atom (since it has four different substituents: a methyl group, a hydrogen (not shown specifically but implied here), a methylene group on one side (CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>), and a vinyl group (CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub>) on the other. 

However, what is important here is that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene means that there is a mixture of two enantiomers of 3-methylpent-1-ene where one is the (R)-3-methylpent-1-ene and the other is the (S)-3-methylpent-1-ene. However, for the purpose of metathesis, the chirality does not usually affect the carbon-carbon double bond reactions significantly except for stereochemical variations in products already formed. 

However, it seems like the main part of the question here is what happens when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene undergoes olefin metathesis in the presence of Grubbs catalyst. 

The given compound has a double bond on carbon 1 and carbon 2. Olefin metathesis can typically be described as:
$$
\mathrm{R_1-CH=CH-R_2 + R_3-CH=CH-R_4 \rightleftharpoons R_1-CH=CH-R_3 + R_2-CH=CH-R_4}.
$$
However, here, the reactant is only racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene where the reactant reacts with itself because there isnâ€™t another alkene mentioned explicitly here. Thus, the reaction can be symmetric self-metathesis where one molecule of 3-methylpent-1-ene reacts with another molecule of 3-methylpent-1-ene. 

Let us denote one molecule of 3-methylpent-1-ene as $\mathrm{A-CH=CH-B}$, where:
$$
\mathrm{A = CH_2} \text{ (also represented as H_2C)} \text{ and } \mathrm{B = CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}.
$$
The self-metathesis reaction where two identical alkenes react can yield three main classes of products (excluding ethene which forms as a byproduct and should be ignored in the question statement):

1. Cross-section products where part A of one molecule reacts with part A of another molecule:
$$
\mathrm{A-CH=CH-B + A-CH=CH-B \rightarrow A-CH=CH-A + B-CH=CH-B}.
$$
2. Cross-section products where part A of one molecule reacts with part B of another:
$$
\mathrm{A-CH=CH-B + A-CH=CH-B \rightarrow A-CH=CH-B + B-CH=CH-A}.
$$
However, this looks misleading because "A-CH=CH-B" is just another molecule of the reactant itself. However, what we need here are the unique products formed from the reaction:
$$
\mathrm{(Cross-metathesis product where part A from one molecule reacts with part B from another can be interpreted as a symmetric metathesis reaction where "part A" recombines with itself and "part B" recombines with itself.)}
$$

Hence, let us make a more explicit reasoning here:
The question states excluding ethene (which is $\mathrm{A-CH=CH-A}$ if $\mathrm{A=CH_2}$ means $\mathrm{CH_2=CH_2}$).

The reaction scheme thus can be:
Based on the metathesis reaction $\mathrm{R_1-CH=CH-R_2 + R_3-CH=CH-R_4 \rightleftharpoons R_1-CH=CH-R_3 + R_2-CH=CH-R_4}$ where both alkene molecules are identical (i.e., $\mathrm{R-CH=CH-R'}$ reacts with another molecule of itself, where here $\mathrm{R=H_2C}$ and $\mathrm{R'=CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}$):

1. Reactant: $\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_3}$ reacts with another molecule of itself:
$$
\mathrm{H_2C=CH-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_3 + H_2C=CH-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_3} \longrightarrow \\
\mathrm{(Total of reactants)} \\
\downarrow\\
\text{Products are formed by "crossing over" the double bonds:} \\
\text{1. } \mathrm{H_2C=CH-CH_2} \text{ (part A-A, which yields ethene, excluded according to question)} + \mathrm{(CH_3-CH_2-CH(CH_3))-CH=CH-(CH_3-CH_2-CH(CH_3))} \text{(B-B part)}\\
\mathrm{CH_2=CH_2 + (CH_3-CH_2-CH(CH_3))-CH=CH-(CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3)} \\
\text{Ethene (excluded) + new alkene (B-B part)}
$$
2. Another possible cross-metathesis might be:
$$
\mathrm{H_2C=CH-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_3 + H_2C=CH-CH(CH_3)-CH_2CH_3} \rightarrow \mathrm{H_2C=CH-CH_2CH_3} \text{ (which appears to be a wrong interpretation because part A should be $CH_2$ which links to only one carbon atom $CH_2=CH$)} + \mathrm{(CH_3CH_2-CH-CH_3)-CH=CH-CH_2} \\
\text{but it seems that the question requires us to identify only the real cross-metathesis products excluding ethene.}
$$

##### Detailed Product Formation:

Analyzing the main part again:
$$
\mathrm{A-CH=CH-B + A-CH=CH-B}.
$$
For the given 3-methylpent-1-ene (which can be denoted as $\mathrm{R_1-CH=CH-R_2}$ specifically where:
$$
\mathrm{R_1=H} \text{ (actually part "A" should be $CH_2=$, which makes part A-C as $H_2C=CH$),}\\
\mathrm{R_2=CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}.
$$
What we need are products such that:
$$
\mathrm{R_1-CH=CH-R_1} \text{ (which here means $CH_2=CH_2$ which is ethene, so it should be excluded)} \text{ or}\\
\mathrm{R_1-CH=CH-R_2} \text{ (which is just another instance of the reactant itself, $CH_2=CH-CH(CH_3)-CH_2CH_3$)} \text{ or}\\
\mathrm{R_2-CH=CH-R_1} \text{ (which is identical to the mirror reaction of $R_1-CH=CH-R_2$, i.e., $R_2-CH=CH-R_1$ is the isomer where $R_1 = CH_2$ connects to $R_2 = CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3$. However, $R_2-CH=CH-R_1$ must be isomerized from $R_1-CH=CH-R_$) $=>$ $CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3-CH=CH_2$, which is actually $4-methylpent-1-ene}$.
$$
The products thus would be:
1. $\mathrm{CH_2=CH_2}$ (ethene, which we need to exclude).
2. $\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_3}$ which is the reactant itself (3-methylpent-1-ene). However, usually when talking about "products," this usually means products that are chemically distinct from the reactants. Therefore, including the reactant itself should be avoided here.
3. $\mathrm{(CH_3CH_2-CH-CH_3})-CH=CH-(CH_3-CH_2-CH-CH_3)$ which is symmetric product formed by combining the "B" part which is $\mathrm{CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}$.

So, analyzing the last part, if $B = \mathrm{CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}$, the $B-B$ product would be:
$$
B-CH=CH-B = \mathrm{(CH_3-CH_2-CH-CH_3)-CH=CH-(CH_3-CH_2-CH-CH_3)}.
$$
Let us expand that part $B-CH=CH-B$ explicitly by plugging $\mathrm{B=CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}$:
$$
\mathrm{B = CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}.
$$
Therefore:
$$
B-CH=CH-B = \mathrm{CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3-CH=CH-CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}.
$$
This would be named as 5,7-dimethyloct-4-ene. However, what makes sense here is that the main part $B$ itself has a chiral center (at the second carbon from the double bond which is the original third carbon from the 3-methylpentanen part).

Another part that could be generated could be if $A$ part only connects to $B$ part where:
$$
\begin{aligned}
A-CH=CH-B &: \text{3-methylpent-1-ene (reactant itself again)} \\
B-CH=CH-A &: \text{a new product formed by swapping $A$ and $B$ positions in the product description.}
\end{aligned}
$$
However, $B-CH=CH-A$ means that the "B" part is first followed by "A" part:
$$
\mathrm{CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3-CH=CH_2}.
$$
This is another compound which should be called $\mathrm{4-methylpent-1-ene}$ only differs in that the longer part of the chain is now on the other side of the double bond compared to 3-methylpent-1-ene where the $CH_2=CH-$ part is on the opposite side.

However, we should verify if $CH_2=CHCH_2CH_2CH_3$ (pent-1-ene) might be a part but upon closer inspection, this appears to be a mistake and what makes sense is only the $CH(CH_3)CH_\subset2CH_3$ part should be used thus:
$$
\mathrm{CH_2=CH_2} \text{(ethene, which should be disregarded)}\\
\mathrm{B-B}: \mathrm{CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3-CH=CH-CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3} \\
\text{(B-B resulted in 5,7-dimethyloct-4-ene)}
$$

However, a reaction such as:
$$
\mathrm{or} \text{ for instance } R_1-CH=CH-R_2 + R_1-CH=CH-R_2 \rightleftharpoons R_1-CH=CH-R_1 + R_2-CH=CH-R_2.
$$
Thus, what we need now is to identify what would be formed:

1. The reaction "reactant + reactant" gives us ethene + the other part which is $B-B$. However, the symmetric part $B-B$ product should be:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-CH(CH_3)-CH=CH-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_3}.
$$
However drawing out another candidate:
$$
CH_2=CH_2 + \mathrm{B-B} \text{ (which is $5,7$-dimethyloct-4-ene)}
$$

Another candidate could be a mixed case where two $\mathrm{CH_2=CH-B}$ molecules exchange:
$$
\mathrm{B-CH=CH-B} \text{ and } \mathrm{CH_2=CH_2}.
$$
However excluding ethene, the only other major product here seems to be $\mathrm{B-CH=CH-B}$.

However, if we check the reaction of a molecule reacting with itself, there are three main types of products formed:
1) $\mathrm{CH_2=CH_2}$ (which should be excluded).
2) Another symmetrical product from the $B-B$ part:
$$
\mathrm{B-CH=CH-B} = \mathrm{[CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3]CH=CH[CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3)}]
$$
3) There is another product which could be derived here is when part $B$ connects to $A$ part again to give us:
$$
\mathrm{B-CH=CH-A} = \mathrm{(CH_3CH_2-CH2-CH3)-CH=CH_2}.
$$
Note that $\mathrm{B-CH=CH-A}$ would be the same molecule instead of having double bond between first and second carbon. 

However, an important part here is that one product should be the "B-B" part which significantly differs from the initial reactant, thus generally we expect two products excluding ethene itself. Another product is the "B-A" part which is $\mathrm{B=R_2} = CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3$, hence $CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3-CH=CH_2$. 

So, what should be done is identifying what unique molecules are generated from the reaction of two molecules of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Based on the given question reasoning, if we summarize:
1. $B-B$ is symmetrical and gives one symmetric product such that:
$$
R-CH=CH-R, \text{ where $R=CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3$}.
$$
2. The same reaction should produce $A-A$ which is:
$$
CH_2=CH_2 \text{(not counted here)}
$$
3. $R_1-CH=CH-R_2$ (which is the original reactant itself though it might not be strictly considered a "product" here, thus we need to check if some reactions make other products).

Let's make sure about symmetries and what valid cuts can be made on the double bond in self-metathesis of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene.

We need another interpretation here. Notice that the reaction should generate three main products:
1. $R_1-CH=CH-R_{{1}} \text{(CH_2=CH_2)}$ (excluded).
2. $R_1-CH=CH-R_2 \text{(same reactant 3-methylpent-1-ene)}$.
3. $BH-CH=CH-BH$ where BH denotes the non-chiral part of the reactant.

Thus, $\mathrm{(R} \text{ and } \mathrm{S)} - 3-methylpent-1-ene$ reacts as:
Let $\mathcal{R}$, $\mathcal{S}$ represent the two enantiomers of 3-methylpent-1-ene such that:
$$
\mathcal{R} \text{ reacts with } \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{S} \text{ reacts with } \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{R} \text{ or } \mathcal{S} \\
$$

However, if we need to make a clear product structure analysis, it makes sense to break apart the alkene component ($\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}$) into two fragments:
1) $CH_2=CH-$ (fragment $A$)
2) $-(CH_3)CH-CH_2CH_3$ moiety (fragment $B$).

However, $CH_2=CH-$ here is called $A-$ fragment where $A$ is $\mathrm{CH_2}$ and $B$ is $\alternative form: \mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3}$. Two copies of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene means:
$$
\mathcal{R}: CH_2=CH-CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3 \\
\mathcal{S}: CH_2=CH-CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3.
$$
So exploring products let us write all combinations explicitly:

$$
CH_2=CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3 (\mathcal{R} \text{ or } \mathcal{S}) + CH_2=CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_3 (\mathcal{R} \text{ or } \mathcal{S}) \\
\Rightarrow (1) CH_2=CH_2 \\
| \Rightarrow (2) CH_2=CH-CH (CH_3)CH_2CH_3 \text{"A-B" again same reactant} \\
|\Rightarrow (3) (CH_3)CHCH_2CH_3=CH-CH (CH_3)CH_2CH_3 \\
$$
This third product ($\bf B-B$) should be $CH_3-CH_2-CH(CH_3)-CH=CH-CH(CH_3)-CH_2-CH_3$, which is $\bf{5,7-dimethyloct-4-ene}$. 

Thus, the listed possible products should be:
1. $\mathbf{5,7-dimethyloct-4-ene}$:
2. Another plausible possible product comes from $CH_3-CH_2- CH-CH_3 -CH=CH_2$:
But as for $CH_2=CH-CH_2CH_2CH_3$, which seems inaccurate because that part might be a misinterpretation. Let us analyze the part $B-CH=CH_2$.

To verify another product, let us name the part $\mathrm{B}$ explicitly where:
$$
B-CH=CH_2 \implies CH_3-CH_2-CH(CH_3)-CH=CH_2.
$$
Which should be named as $4-methylpent-1-ene$. Notice that the part mentioned here $CH_3-CH_2-CH(CH_3)-CH=CH_2$.

Let us compare $3-methylpent-1-ene$ vs. $4-methylpent-1-ene$. These two are constitutional isomers because they have different carbon chains and positions of substituents are different.

So, excluding ethene, we need to identify the remaining valid products. 

1. $\mathbf{3-methylpent-1-ene}$ (which seems already a reactant, so normally not considered a product formed from reaction).
2. $\mathbf{4-methylpent-1-ene}$ $CH_3-CH_2-CH(CH_3)-CH=CH_2$ (= isomer of reactant).
3. $\mathbf{5,7-dimethyloct
