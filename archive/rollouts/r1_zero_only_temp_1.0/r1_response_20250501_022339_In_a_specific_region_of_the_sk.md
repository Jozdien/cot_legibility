To solve for how the number of stars per unit range of distance varies with distance $r$, given that the observed number of stars varies with parallax $plx$ as $1/plx^5$, we need to first recall that the parallax $plx$ (typically denoted as $p$ or $\varpi$, but here we'll use $ plx $) is defined as:

$$plx = \frac{1}{r},$$
where $r$ is the distance from the Earth to the star in parsecs (since parallax is usually measured in arcseconds and $plx$ in arcseconds corresponds to a distance in parsecs defined by $r = \frac{1}{plx}$ where $plx$ is in arcseconds).

The statement indicates that the observed number of stars varies with parallax such that:
$$N(plx) \propto \frac{1}{plx^5}.$$

However, what we need to find out is how the number of stars varies per unit range of distance as a function of $r$. The question asks us to find the function $N(r)$ such that it represents the "number of stars per unit range of distance" at a given value of $r$. 

Let us explicitly define:
- $N(plx) \, dplx$ as the number of stars whose parallax lies in the interval $[plx, plx + dplx]$.
- $N(r) \, dr$ as the number of stars whose distance lies in the interval $[r, r + dr]$.

The question states that the distribution of the number of stars over a parallax interval $[plx, plx+dplx]$ is proportional to $1/plx^5$. Thus:
$$N(plx) \, dplx = \alpha \cdot \frac{dplx}{plx^5},$$
where $\alpha$ is a proportionality constant.

However, what we need instead is the distribution over a distance interval $[r, r + dr]$. We need to change variables from $plx$ to $r$. Recall that $r = \frac{1}{plx}$, so:
$$plx = \frac{1}{r}.$$

Differentiating $plx$ with respect to $r$:
$$dplx = -\frac{1}{r^2} dr.$$
(The negative sign here indicates that an increase in $r$ corresponds to a decrease in $plx$, but since we typically only care about the absolute value of the interval size $dplx$, we'll take the absolute value later.)

Now, we need to express the total number of stars in the parallax interval $[plx, plx + dplx]$, which should be equal to the total number of stars in the corresponding distance interval $[r - dr, r]$ (since $dplx$ is negative when $dr$ is positive, so $plx + dplx$ corresponds to $r - dr$ or $plx - dplx$ corresponds to $r + dr$, depending on the substitution's direction). But what we need is the distribution itself such that:
$$N(plx) \, dplx = N(r) \, dr.$$

Previously, using the given relation that $N(plx) \propto \frac{1}{plx^5}$, we need to make a substitution here:
$$N(plx) = \frac{\alpha}{plx^5},$$
which means:
$$N(plx) \, dplx = \frac{\alpha}{plx^5} dplx$$

However, what we need is $N(r) \, dr$. Thus:
$$N(r) \, dr = N(plx) \, |dplx|.$$

But what we need here is to make sure that the absolute value for $dplx$ is used because the "number of stars" should be a positive quantity:
$$N(r) \, dr = \alpha \cdot \frac{dplx}{plx^5} \text{ (using $plx = \frac{1}{r}$)}.$$
Since $dplx = -\frac{1}{r^2} dr$, substituting this into the equation yields:
$$N(r) \, dr = \alpha \cdot \frac{-\frac{1}{r^2} dr}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = -\alpha \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{r^2} dr}{\frac{1}{r^5}} = -\alpha \cdot \frac{r^5}{r^2} dr = -\alpha r^3 dr.$$
However, the negative sign here indicates that an increase in $plx$ (positive $dplx$) corresponds to a decrease in $r$ (negative $dr$), yet what matters here physically is the magnitude of the quantity $N(r) \, dr$, which should be a positive value representing the positive number of stars within a distance interval $dr$. Thus, we should interpret the absolute value of the relation such that:
$$N(r) \, dr = \Bigg|\alpha \cdot \frac{-1}{r^2} dr \cdot \left(\frac{1}{plx^5}\right)\Bigg|$$

We need to substitute $plx = \frac{1}{r}$ explicitly:
$$N(r) \, dr = \Bigg|\alpha \cdot \frac{-1}{r^2} dr \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5}\right)\Bigg| = \Bigg|\alpha \cdot \frac{-1}{r^2} dr \cdot r^5\Bigg| = \Bigg|-\alpha r^3 dr\Bigg|.$$

Because there cannot be a "negative" number of stars, we ignore the negative sign as it only denotes the direction of differential change (i.e., $|dplx|$ should be positive, so):
$$N(r) \, dr\Big|_{positive} = \alpha r^3 dr.$$

Alternatively, if we recognize that $N(plx) \, dplx$ is the "number of stars for a given $dplx$," the question asks for the "number of stars per unit range of distance" which means:
$$N(r) = \frac{\alpha r^5 \, |dplx|}{dr} = \alpha r^5 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} = \alpha r^3.$$
which agrees with our previous reasoning if we make sure here that what we need is only the absolute magnitude of the "number of stars per unit range":
$$N(r) \sim \left|\alpha \times r^^3\right|.$$
However, any positive constant proportionality here still keeps us just considering the behavior of $r$.

However, we need to double-check what happens when we just directly substitute into what the actual question is explicitly mentioning:
$$\alpha \times r^3.$$

So, the answer appears correctly derived here should be that the number of stars per unit interval of distance should be proportional to $r^3$. However, the final answer seems off. Based on the question statement, $N(r)$ describes the "number of stars (per unit range of $r$)". Based on our derivation, that appears to be:
$$
N(r) \propto r^3.
$$
However, the question is asked in a way that seems like we need to verify if some other forms such as "$r^2$" might make sense too but first, let us verify once again what we need.

#### Double-checking the "proper velocity" part is irrelevant here:
If we need $N(r)$ explicitly:

Let us define:
$$
\frac{dN}{dr}.
$$
This is what we need.

We have been given:
$$
\frac{dN}{dplx} = \frac{\alpha}{plx^5}.
$$
Another substitution we need here uses the chain rule:
$$
\frac{dN}{dr} = \frac{dN}{dplx} \cdot \frac{dplx}{dr}.
$$
$$
\frac{dplx}{dr} = \dfrac{-1}{r^2} = -plx^2,
$$
so let us solve for $\frac{dN}{dr}$:
$$
\frac{dN}{dr} = \frac{\alpha}{plx^5} \cdot \left(\frac{-1}{r^2}\right) = \frac{\alpha}{plx^5} \times \left(-plx^2\right) = \frac{- \alpha}{plx^3} = -\alpha \times r^3.
$$

However, we need the absolute value because the "number of stars per unit range of distance" should be a positive quantity. Thus:
$$
\left|\frac{dN}{dr}\right| = \alpha r^3.
$$
This makes us confident that the "number of stars per unit range of $r$" scales as $r^3$.

Considering that the question now only asks "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance $r$)?", the answer shows that the number distances should be proportionally distributed such that:
$$
\text{Number of stars per unit range of $r$} \propto r^3.
$$

Based on this reasoning, the answer appears to be:
$$
\boxed{r^3}.
$$
Hence according to analysis performed here, the star count increases proportionally to $r^3$.
This follows from transforming the given $1/plx^5$ distribution with respect to parallax into a distribution with respect to distance $r$.

Another way could be to explicitly check what happens when we directly substitute $plx$:
$$
N(plx) \propto \frac{1}{plx^5} \implies N(r) \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5,
$$
However here $N(plx)$ refers to distribution in parallax space while $N(r)$ refers to distribution in distance space where $N(r)dr \propto r^3 dr$. Another interpretation might be just directly substitute $r \propto (plx)^{-1}$. Thus, $plx \propto r^{-1}$, thus $dplx \propto -r^{-2}dr$. Thus:
$$
\frac{dN}{dr} = \dfrac{dN}{dplx} \times \dfrac{dplx}{dr}.
$$
Based strictly on the question,

$$
\frac{dN}{dplx} = \frac{\kappa}{plx^5}.
$$
where $\kappa$ is constant of proportionality. Thus:
$$
\frac{dN}{dr} = \frac{\kappa}{(1/r)^5} \times (-1/r^2) = \kappa r^5 \times \left(-\frac{1}{r^2}\right) = -\kappa r^3.
$$
The negative sign here indicates that the variable transformation "flips" the relation, but for the physical quantity representing the "number of stars" per unit range of distance $dr$, the magnitude should be what matters. Another round of checking this is that:
$$
\frac{dN}{dplx} = K \cdot \frac{1}{plx^5} = K \cdot r^5.
$$
But still what matters is how many stars there are per unit distance interval $dr$, so:
$$
\frac{dN}{dr} = \frac{dN}{dplx} \cdot \frac{dplx}{dr} = K r^5 \cdot (-r^{-2}) = -K r^3.
$$
The minus sign here primarily indicates that as $r$ increases, the parallax $plx$, which is $1/r$, decreases. However, what matters for our present computation is the absolute value of the number of stars distributed over a unit range of $r$, which turns out to be proportional to $\alpha r^3$. Hence, the answer here appears to be that the star density in terms of distance itself varies proportionally to $r^3$.

To make everything clear, again:
The actual "number of stars in a unit parallax interval near parallax $plx$" varies as $1/plx^5$, which means:
$$
\Delta N = k \cdot \frac{\Delta plx}{plx^5}.
$$
where $\Delta N$ is the number of stars in the parallax interval $\Delta plx$ around $plx$. Similarly, the "number of stars in a unit distance interval near distance $r$" can be described as:
$$
\Delta N = \widetilde{k} \cdot \Delta r \widetilde{N(r)},
$$
hence $\widetilde{N(r)}$ here is what we need. However, the same real "number of stars" represents the same set of stars described in two frames (parallax vs. distance). Therefore:
$$
k \cdot \frac{\Delta plx}{plx^5} = \widetilde{k} \widetilde{N(r)} \Delta r.
$$
Let us parse what "$\widetilde{N(r)}$" means here explicitly:
$$
k^\prime \cdot \frac{1}{r^5} \cdot \Delta plx = \widetilde{N(r)} \Delta r.
$$
Where $k^\prime = k / \left(\frac{1}{r^5}\right) = k \cdot r^5$ if we make a substitution $plx = \frac{1}{r}$, so $\Delta plx \approx \left|\frac{dplx}{dr}\right| \Delta r = \frac{1}{r^2} \Delta r$:
$$
k \cdot r^5 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \Delta r = \widetilde{N(r)} \Delta r.
$$
Thus:
$$
\widetilde{N(r)} \Delta r = k r^3\Delta r,
$$
which means:
$$
\widetilde{N(r)} = k r^3.
$$
Thus, everything seems to make sure that the answer should indeed be $r^3$.
