To solve for the velocity of particle $A$ produced in the annihilation process $p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-$, we need to apply conservation laws such as conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. 

Given that the reaction is:
$$p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-$$
we need to find the velocity of particle $A$. 

The problem statement tells us that the antiproton ($\bar{p}$) is "slowly moving." This implies that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy $m_p c^2$. Another part of the problem statement mentions that the rest mass energy of particle $A$ is given by:
$$m_A c^2 = 300 \text{ MeV}.$$

Let us assume that the proton is stationary while the antiproton has a small velocity such that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy $m_p c^2$, which is roughly $938 \text{ MeV}$ (note that the rest mass of a proton is approximately $938 \text{ MeV}/c^2$, so $m_p c^2 \approx 938 \text{ MeV}$). 

The total initial energy includes the rest mass energies of the proton and antiproton (since their mass is typically equal except for the difference in charge, $m_p = m_{\bar{p}}$):
$$m_p c^2 + m_{\bar{p}} c^2 + K_{\bar{p}},$$
where $K_{\bar{p}}$ is the kinetic energy of the antiproton which is negligible here. Thus, the total initial energy can be approximated as:
$$m_p c^2 + m_{\bar{p}} c^2 = 2m_p c^2,$$
again assuming $m_p = m_{\bar{p}}$.

The total initial momentum is primarily due to the antiproton (since the proton is assumed stationary):
$$\vec{p}_{\text{initial}} = \vec{p}_{\bar{p}}.$$
However, the problem uses the term "slowly moving" antiproton so $\vec{p}_{\bar{p}}$ should be small. To make further simplifications, we assume that the total initial momentum is approximately zero. This requires us to make a more refined description where both the antiproton and the proton have a very small velocity such that the center of mass is nearly at rest when the antiproton velocity is small.

To make a more rigorous analysis, let us keep the antiproton's momentum explicitly until we make an assumption that it is negligible. Applying conservation of momentum:
$$\vec{p}_p + \vec{p}_{\bar{p}} = \vec{p}_{2A^+} + \vec{p}_{2A^-}.$$
However, this seems a bit imprecise. Here, $2 A^+$ and $2A^-$ means that there are two positively charged $A^+$ particles and two negatively charged $A^-$ particles. So let us label momenta for the four resulting particles separately:
$$p + \bar{p} \rightarrow A_1^+ + A_2^+ + A_1^- + A_2^-.$$
By labeling the momenta separately for the outgoing particles as $\vec{p}_{A_1^+}$, $\vec{p}_{A_2^+}$, $\vec{p}_{A_1^-}$, and $\vec{p}_{A_2^-}$, the conservation of momentum is:
$$\vec{p}_p + \vec{p}_{\bar{p}} = \vec{p}_{A_1^+} + \vec{p}_{A_2^+} + \vec{p}_{A_1^-} + \vec{p}_{A_2^-}.$$
However, the total momentum should be zero if we assume that the initial conditions make the center of mass frame essentially the same as the lab frame where the antiproton is "slowly moving". So, it makes sense to first verify what "slowly moving" means explicitly. Since no specific value is given for the velocity of the antiproton, a safe assumption is that both the proton and the antiproton are nearly at rest such that their total center of mass frame is also nearly at rest. 

To make such a reason, one usually denotes the total energy in the lab frame (where the proton is at rest and antiproton is moving with a velocity $v$ such that $v/c \ll 1$):
$$E_{\text{total, initial}} = m_p c^2 + (\gamma_{\bar{p}} m_{\bar{p}} c^2).$$
However, if the antiproton is "slowly moving," $\gamma_{\bar{p}} \approx 1$, so:
$$E_{\text{total, initial}} \approx m_p c^2 + m_{\bar{p}} c^2.$$
By symmetry (assuming equal masses $m_p = m_{\bar{p}}$):
$$= 2m_p c^2.$$
Total energy should be conserved:
$$2m_p c^2 = E_{A_1^+} + E_{A_2^+} + E_{A_1^-} + E_{A_2^-}.$$
For symmetric cases such that $A_1^+$ has the same velocity as $A_2^+$ and $A_1^-$ has the same velocity as $A_2^-$, we need to find the total energy expended in the resulting particles such that:
$$2m_p c^2 = 4E_A,$$
where $E_A$ is the total energy (including rest mass and kinetic energy) for each individual $A$ particle (since all $A^+$ and $A^-$ particles are symmetric here). Thus:
$$2m_p c^2 = 4 (\gamma_A m_A c^2),$$
where $\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2 / c^2}}$ with $v_A$ being the velocity of particle $A^+$ and $A^-$. 

The goal is to find the velocity $v_A$ of particles $A^+$ or $A^-$. We solve such that:
$$2m_p c^2 = 4\gamma_A m_A c^2,$$
thus:
$$m_p c^2 = 2 \gamma_A m_A c^2. $$

We solve for $\gamma_A$:
$$\gamma_A = \frac{m_p c^2}{2m_A c^2}.$$
We need $m_p c^2$, which equals approximately $938\text{ MeV}$. Given $m_A c^2 = 300 \text{ MeV}$:
$$\gamma_A = \frac{938 \text{ MeV}}{2 \times 300 \text{ MeV}} = \frac{938}{600} \approx 1.5633.$$

We recall:
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}$$
so that:
$$1.5633 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v_A}{c}\right)^2}}.$$
Solving for $v_A$:
$$
1.5633^2 = \frac{1}{1 - \left(\frac{v_A}{c}\right)^2},
$$
which gives:
$$
2.4439 \approx \frac{1}{1 - \left(\frac{v_A}{c}\right)^2}.
$$
$$
1 - \left(\frac{v_A}{c}\right)^2 \approx \frac{1}{2.4439} \approx 0.4092,
$$
$$
\left(\frac{v_A}{c}\right)^2 \approx 1 - 0.4092,
$$
$$
\left(\frac{v_A}{c}\right)^2 \approx 0.5908,
$$
$$
\frac{v_A}{c} \approx \sqrt{0.5908} \approx 0.7686,
$$
$$
v_A \approx 0.7686c.
$$

To confirm our working thus fits the conservation of momentum as well, recall that total initial momentum is roughly zero (since proton is at rest and antiproton is "slowly moving"). Total final momentum should also be zero in the center-of-mass frame:
$$
\vec{p}_{\text{initial}} = \vec{p}_{p} + \vec{p}_{\bar{p}} \approx 0.
$$
Thus:
$$
0 = \vec{p}_{A_1^+} + \vec{p}_{A_2^+} + \vec{p}_{A_1^-} + \vec{p}_{A_2^-}.
$$
However, the question implies that the $A^+$ and $A^-$ particles are symmetrically emitted such that:
$$
\vec{p}_{A_1^+} + \vec{p}_{A_2^+} = -\vec{p}_{A_1^-} - \vec{p}_{A_2^-}.
$$
Given that $A_1^+$ and $A_2^+$ should carry equal momenta in magnitude and similarly for $A_1^-$ and $A_2^-$, a symmetric distribution could be:
Two particles $A^+$ travel symmetrically opposite directions such that the total momentum of $A^+$ particles cancels that of the $A^-$ particles traveling in the opposite directions. Another possible symmetric case might be that all four $A$ particles (2 $A^+$ and 2 $A^-$) could be emitted such that their momenta sum together to zero. 

However, what we need here is just that the total momentum should be zero such that the momenta sum up symmetrically such that:
$$
0 = \vec{p}_{A_1^+} + \vec{p}_{A_2^+} + \vec{p}_{A_1^-} + \vec{p}_{A_2^-};
$$
which makes sense here once all $A$ particles should have the same magnitude of momentum if one assumes a symmetric situation where $A_1^+$ and $A_2^+$ have the same magnitude of momentum in one direction while $A_1^-$ and $A_2^-$ have the same magnitude (however opposite direction if necessary).

Thus, the found velocity $v_A = 0.7686c$ fits perfectly well for a symmetric distribution where all $A$'s could be emitted such that their momenta vectors sum to zero.

So, the velocity of particle $A$ can be rounded appropriately based on significant digits such that:
$$v_A \approx 0.77c.$$

Another round of verification confirms that energy is conserved where:
$$
2 \times 938 \text{ MeV} = (4 \text{ particles}) \times \gamma \times 300 \text{ MeV},
$$
such that:
$$
1876 = 4 \times 1.5633 \times 300,
$$
$$
1876 = 4 \times 469,
$$
$$
1876 = 1876\text{ MeV},
$$
which makes sense numerically as verifying total energy matches before and after the reaction.

Hence, the velocity of particle $A$ obtained here is:
$$
\boxed{0.7686c}~{} \text{(which could reasonably be rounded to} \approx 0.77c).
$$
However, a more round value might be $0.77c$.

To make sure we round everything correctly:

Because the question didnâ€™t specify what the "proton rest mass energy" is, if we explicitly use $m_{p}c^2$, which is approximately given by $938 \text{ MeV}$ (which is a well-known value for the proton rest energy), a rounded answer makes sense here based on the given value of $938 \text{ MeV}$ for $m_p c^2$:
$$
v_A = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \times c,
$$
where $\gamma \approx 1.5633$:
$$
v_A = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} = c \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \approx c \cdot 0.7686.
$$
So:
$$
v_A \approx 0.7686c,
$$
which is a robust answer around $0.769c$ or equivalently, $\sim 2.3 \times 10^8\text{ m/s}$ if $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$.
