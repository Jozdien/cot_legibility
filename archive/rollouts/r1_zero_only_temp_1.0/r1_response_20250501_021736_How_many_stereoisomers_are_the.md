To solve for the number of stereoisomers for the compound `6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol`, we need to identify the stereocenters and the double bonds present in the compound.

The compound name is:
`6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol`

Let us break this compound name apart systematically:
1. The main part of the compound name is `undeca`, which tells us that the molecule contains an 11-carbon chain ("undec" means eleven).
2. The part `6-chloro` indicates that there is a chlorine atom at the 6th carbon position.
3. The part `9-ethyl` indicates that there is an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached at the 9th carbon atom.
4. The part `2-methyl` indicates that there is a methyl group (CH3) attached to the 2nd carbon atom.
5. `3,7-dien` indicates that there are double bonds at positions 3 and 7 (meaning double bonds are located between carbons 3 and 4, and between carbons 7 and 8).
6. Finally, `5-ol` signifies that there is a hydroxyl group (OH) attached at the 5th carbon atom.

To sketch the backbone structure of the compound `6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol`, let us draw out the main undecane (11 carbon atoms) chain and include the specified substituents:
$$\text{CH}_3-\text{CH}(\text{CH}_3)-\text{CH}=\text{CH}-\text{CH}(\text{OH})-\text{CH}(\text{Cl})-\text{CH}-\text{CH}=\text{CH}-\text{CH}(\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3)-\text{CH}_2-\text{CH}_3$$

To make it clearer, let us place the chain systematically:
1. An 11-carbon chain (counting from left to right or right to left should be consistent):
$$
{\underset{1}{\text{C}}}-\underset{2}{\text{C}}-\underset{3}{\text{C}}=\underset{4}{\text{C}}-\underset{5}{\text{C}}-\underset{6}{\text{C}}-\underset{7}{\text{C}}=\underset{8}{\text{C}}-\underset{9}{\text{C}}-\underset{10}{\text{C}}-\underset{11}{\text{C}}
$$
2. A methyl group on the second carbon (so carbon 2 is actually a $\text{CH}-\text{CH}_3$ part where $\text{CH}$ signifies that it is part of the main chain and has one hydrogen replaced by a methyl group).
$$
{\underset{1}{\text{C}}}-\underset{2}{\text{C}(\text{CH}_3)}-\underset{3}{\text{C}}=\underset{4}{\text{C}}-\underset{5}{\text{C}}-\underset{6}{\text{C}}-\underset{7}{\text{C}}=\underset{8}{\text{C}}-\underset{9}{\text{C}}-\underset{10}{\text{C}}-\underset{11}{\text{C}}
$$
3. An ethyl group on carbon 9 (so carbon 9 is actually a $\text{CH}-\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3$ part where $\text{CH}$ signifies that it is part of the main chain and has one hydrogen replaced by an ethyl group).
$$
{\underset{1}{\text{C}}}-\underset{2}{\text{C}(\text{CH}_3)}-\underset{3}{\text{C}}=\underset{4}{\text{C}}-\underset{5}{\text{C}}-\underset{6}{\text{C}}-\underset{7}{\text{C}}=\underset{8}{\text{C}}-\underset{9}{\text{C}(\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3)}-\underset{10}{\text{C}}-\underset{11}{\text{C}}
$$
4. A chlorine atom on carbon 6 (so carbon 6 is actually a $\text{C}-\text{Cl}$ part where $\text{C}$ signifies that it is part of the main chain).
$$
{\underset{1}{\text{C}}}-\underset{2}{\text{C}(\text{CH}_3)}-\underset{3}{\text{C}}=\underset{4}{\text{C}}-\underset{5}{\text{C}}-\underset{6}{\text{C}(\text{Cl})}-\underset{7}{\text{C}}=\underset{8}{\text{C}}-\underset{9}{\text{C}(\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3)}-\underset{10}{\text{C}}-\underset{11}{\text{C}}
$$
5. A hydroxyl group on carbon 5 (so carbon 5 is a $\text{C}-\text{OH}$ part where $\text{C}$ signifies that it is part of the main chain).
$$
{\underset{1}{\text{C}}}-\underset{2}{\text{C}(\text{CH}_3)}-\underset{3}{\text{C}}=\underset{4}{\text{C}}-\underset{5}{\text{C}(\text{OH})}-\underset{6}{\text{C}(\text{Cl})}-\underset{7}{\text{C}}=\underset{8}{\text{C}}-\underset{9}{\text{C}(\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3)}-\underset{10}{\text{C}}-\underset{11}{\text{C}}
$$
    
#### Double Bond Configurations (cis/trans isomerism)
There are two double bonds in this molecule, one between carbons 3 and 4 (`3,4-double bond`) and another between carbons 7 and 8 (`7,8-double bond`). For double bonds, the term "cis/trans" or "Z/E" isomerism comes into play. Thus, if there are two double bonds here there can be four possible geometric isomers for those two double bonds (assuming no other stereocenters yet):

1. cis-3,7 (cis-cis isomer)
2. cis-3, trans-7 (cis-trans isomer)
3. trans-3, cis-7 (trans-cis isomer)
4. trans-3,7 (trans-trans isomer)

A double bond could contribute up to $2^n$ geometric isomers where $n$ is the number of double bonds. However, we need to check if there are any steric constraints making any cis configurations impossible (however, in most cases, both cis and trans configurations are generally possible unless there are significant steric hindrances such as bulky substituents preventing a cis configuration).

#### Chirality Centers (Stereocenters)
A carbon atom can be a stereocenter if it is attached to four different groups. For carbon atoms in a chain, a carbon must be bonded to four different substituents to be a chiral center. 

Based on our structure for `6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol`, let us verify carbon atoms 2, 5, 6, and 9:

1. **Carbon 2**: $\text{CH}_3-\text{(main chain carbon)}-\text{CH}=\text{CH}(\text{H})$, attached groups are $\text{CH}_3$, an $\text{H}$ (the hydrogen implied), another $\text{H}$, and a part of the chain which spans from carbon 1 to the rest of the chain until the double bond at carbon 3. The part attached to carbon 2 includes:
    - Methyl group ($\text{CH}_3$).
    - Hydrogen atom.
    - A chain which ends at carbon 1 (which is part of the main chain).
    - The part of the chain which goes towards carbon 3 until the double bond at carbon 3. 

    Since carbon 2 is attached to a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, another part of the main chain (carbon 1 part), and another part of the main chain (carbon 3 part), we need to check if carbon 2 has four different substituents. However, carbon 2 has a methyl group and a main chain part that splits two ways (one part goes to carbon 1 where there might be three hydrogens if carbon 1 is a methyl group, and the other part goes toward carbon 3 which might make carbon 2 chiral if the "two main chain parts" look different. To make a more specific check, if carbon 2 carries four distinct groups (methyl, part of the chain including carbon 1 which is a $\text{CH}_\text{3}$ group if we only count up to that part, part of the chain heading towards carbon 3 and double bond, and a hydrogen atom), it makes sense to verify what part of the chain looks like. 

    - For symmetry, check if $\text{CH}_3-\text{CH}(\text{CH}_3)$ versus $\text{CH}_3-\text{CH}(\text{CH}_3)-\text{CH}=\text{CH}-\text{*)}$ where `*` denotes the rest of the chain. Even if carbon 1 is a methyl group, the part going from carbon 2 to carbon 1 is different structurally compared to the part going from carbon 2 to carbon 3 (since one part includes a double bond whereas carbon 1 does not).
    However, another important part is checking if the two "main chain parts" are indeed different. The part connecting carbon 1 (which seems to be a $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}$ group ending in $\text{CH}_3$ if carbon 1 is a terminal carbon atom) is clearly different from the part that leads towards carbon 3 (different because one part contains a double bond while the other part ends in methyl $\text{CH}_3$ group).

    Thus, carbon 2 seems to be a chiral center because it seems to have four distinct groups:
    - $\text{CH}_3$ (methyl group)
    - The part of the molecule up till carbon 1 (which is $\text{CH}_3$)
    - The part of the molecule which continues until carbon 3 and beyond (which includes the double bond)
    - The hydrogen atom (which is always there but not usually mentioned explicitly)

2. **Carbon 5**: This carbon has a hydroxyl group (OH), a hydrogen atom, and parts of the chain which extend towards carbon 4 (which has a double bond to carbon 3) and towards carbon 6 (which has a chlorine substituent). Therefore, it appears that carbon 5 is attached to:
    - $\text{OH}$ group.
    - $\text{Cl}$ containing part from carbon 6 onwards until the end of the chain.
    - The part going until carbon 4 where there is a double bond connecting carbon 4 and carbon 3.
    - A hydrogen atom.
    
    The part that leads to carbon 4 includes a double bond at carbon 3 which differs from the part that leads to carbon 6 which includes a chlorine atom at carbon 6. Hence, carbon 5 also seems to be a chiral center because it appears to have four different groups attached (hydroxyl group, part of the chain towards carbon 4 that includes a double bond, part of the chain towards carbon 6 that includes a chlorine substituent, and a hydrogen atom).

3. **Carbon 6**: This carbon has a chlorine atom (Cl), a hydrogen atom, the part of the chain which extends towards carbon 5 (which has a hydroxyl group), and the part of the chain which extends towards carbon 7 (which has a double bond connecting carbon 7 and carbon 8). Therefore, carbon 6 appears to be attached to:
    - $\text{Cl}$ group.
    - $\text{OH}$ group part (carbon 5 part which itself has a hydroxyl group).
    - The part that leads to carbon 7 where there is a double bond connecting carbon 7 and carbon 8.
    - A hydrogen atom.
    
    The part that leads to carbon 5 has a hydroxyl group, whereas the part extending to carbon 7 contains a double bond. Hence, carbon 6 also seems to be a chiral center because apparently, it too has four different groups attached.

4. **Carbon 9**: This carbon has an ethyl group (CH2CH3), a hydrogen atom, the part of the chain stretching from carbon 8 (which has a double bond connecting carbon 8 and carbon 7), and a part which leads to carbon 10 until carbon 11 as:
    - $\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3$ (ethyl group).
    - Hydrogen atom.
    - Part of the chain that goes to carbon 8 where there is a double bond.
    - Part of the chain that goes toward carbon 10 until carbon 11.
    
    Similar to the previous cases, the part that leads to carbon 8 has a double bond whereas the part that leads to carbon 10 connects until carbon 11 (methyl terminus). Hence, carbon 9 also seems to be a chiral center because it also seems to have four different groups attached.

#### Total Number of Chirality Centers:
Based on the previous analysis, it appears that carbons 2, 5, 6, and 9 are all chiral centers (assuming that there indeed are four different groups attached to each of these carbon atoms). 

#### Total Number of Stereoisomers:
For a compound with $n$ chiral centers and $m$ double bonds (considering geometric isomerism for double bonds), the total number of stereoisomers is typically $2^n \times 2^m$, where $2^n$ comes from chiral centers (since a single chiral center typically gives two stereoisomers, so $n$ chiral centers typically give $2^n$ isomers if there are no meso compounds where internal symmetry makes some isomers identical), and $2^m$ reflects the need to consider cis and trans configurations for each double bond (though a double bond itself provides two geometric isomers if no other constraints apply).

This reasoning leads us to a theoretical maximum of $2^{4}$ stereoisomers due to chiral centers alone (since there are 4 chiral centers), plus the contributions from the two double bonds which give rise to $2^2 = 4$ geometric isomer combinations (cis-cis, cis-trans, trans-cis, and trans-trans).

However, the total number of stereoisomers can be calculated as follows:

Total stereoisomers = $2^{(n+k)}$ where $n$ is the number of chiral centers and $k$ is the number of double bonds that exhibit geometric isomerism (cis/trans isomerism).
Total stereoisomers = $2^{(4+2)} = 2^6$, if we simply combine the effects independently where $4$ is the number of chiral centers and $2$ is the number of double bonds.

However, the typical formula for the total number of stereoisomers should be:
$$
2^n \times 2^m
$$
where $n$ is the number of chiral centers (4 in this case) and $m$ is the number of double bonds (2 in this case):
$$
\Rightarrow 2^4 \times 2^2 = 16 \times 4 = 64
$$
However, this needs a double check on the "2^n" part for chirality ($n$ is the number of chiral centers).

However, a more intuitive way to check if there are indeed $2^4$ configurations for the chiral centers alone could be:
$$
\binom{2}{1} \times \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{2}{1} \times \binom{2}{1} = 16
$$
So, the total number of stereoisomers should be $16 \times 4 = 64$.

However, this seems a bit overestimated. Another part that needs a verification is:
Total degree of isomerism can be derived like this:
If there are 4 chiral centers thus $2^4$ stereoisomers for one geometric configuration such as "(3Z,7Z)".

Independent configurations are thus:
1. $(ZZ)$ - both double bonds could be either $Z$ (cis) or $E$ (trans).
2. $(ZE)$ - first double bond is $Z$, second is $E$.
3. $(EZ)$ - first double bond is $E$, second is $Z$.
4. $(EE)$ - both double bonds are $E$.

So, total combination possibilities are $16$ stereoisomers for each of the geometric isomers i.e., $ZZ$, $ZE$, $EZ$, or $EE$. Therefore, the total theoretical stereoisomeric count looks like:
$$
16 \times 4 = 64,
$$
which seems to make sense.

However, before finalizing this, let us verify if there are any meso compounds which might make us reduce the total number. However, checking for internal planes of symmetry usually requires a visual inspection or a drawing which might be difficult here. Yet, for compounds where such symmetry exists, some "stereoisomers" might be identical (which makes them meso compounds).

However, a meso compound should contain chiral centers but still be optically inactive due to a plane of symmetry making part of the molecule a mirror image of itself making the two "chiral centers" mirror images within the same molecule. However, such a check here could be complicated.

Thus, based on this reasoning, the answer appears to be:
$$
\boxed{64}.
$$
However, an important part here is a double-check if the reasoning about chiral centers holds properly.

However, a slightly refined check can be made by drawing the full structure explicitly:
`6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol` could be written as:
$$
\underset{1}{\text{CH}_3}-\underset{2}{\text{(*)CH}}-\underset{3}{\text{CH}}=\underset{4}{\text{CH}}-\underset{5}{\text{(**)CH}}-\underset{6}{\text{(***)CH}}-\underset{7}{\text{CH}}=\underset{8}{\text{CH}}-\underset{9}{\text{($)CH}}-\underset{10}{\text{CH}_2}-\underset{11}{\text{CH}_3}
$$
Where:
- Carbon (*) has substituents: methyl (CH3), H, part of the chain leading to carbon 1 (which is a CH3 group), and part heading to carbon 3 where the path includes a double bond.
- Carbon (**) has substituents: H, OH, part heading to carbon 4 (which includes a double bond connecting to carbon 3), and part heading to carbon 6 including a chlorine substituent at carbon 6.
- Carbon (***) has substituents: H, Cl, part heading to carbon 5 that includes a hydroxyl group, and part heading to carbon 7 including a double bond to carbon 8.
- Carbon ($) has substituents: H, ethyl group (CH2CH3), part heading to carbon 8 where there is a double bond connecting to carbon 7, and part heading to carbon 10 which connects to carbon 11 where carbon 11 is a methyl group.

Based on this, another check should be made by explicitly drawing out the structures and verifying whether there might be internal symmetry planes
