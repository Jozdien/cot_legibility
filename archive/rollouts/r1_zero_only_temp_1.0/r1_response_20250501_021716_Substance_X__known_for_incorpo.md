4. "Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Let us break down the first part of the question.

#### "Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons."

The question states that the gas W has a molecule where the total number of neutrons equals the total number of protons. The total number of protons in a molecule is equal to the sum of the atomic numbers of all the atoms in the molecule. The total number of neutrons is the sum of the mass numbers minus the sum of the atomic numbers (since the number of neutrons is given by the mass number minus the atomic number for each atom).

The question states that the "molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." For a molecule composed of atoms $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ where $A_i$ has atomic number $Z_i$ and mass number $A_i$, the total number of protons is:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} Z_i
$$
The total number of neutrons is:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} (A_i - Z_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n} Z_i
$$
The question states that the total number of neutrons equals the total number of protons:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} Z_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n} Z_i
$$
$$
2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} Z_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i
$$
This means that the total mass number (sum of the mass numbers of all atoms in the molecule) is twice the total atomic number (sum of the atomic numbers of all atoms in the molecule).

#### Common gases where the total number of neutrons might equal the total number of protons include:
- $H_2$: Total protons = $2 \times 1 = 2$, total neutrons depends on the isotope (if $^1H$, total neutrons = $0$; if $^2H$, total neutrons = $2$; if $^3H$, total neutrons = $4$). For $^1H_2$, total mass number is $2$, total atomic number is $2$, so total neutrons is $2 - 2 = 0$, which does not make the total number of neutrons equal to the total number of protons.
- $D_2$ (deuterium gas, $^2H_2$): Total protons = $2 \times 1 = 2$, total mass number is $4$, total atomic number is $2$, so total neutrons is $4 - 2 = 2$, which makes the total number of neutrons equal to the total number of protons here.
- $T_2$ (tritium gas, $^3H_2$): Total protons = $2 \times 1 = 2$, total mass number is $6$, total atomic number is $2$, so total neutrons is $6 - 2 = 4$, which makes the total number of neutrons not equal to the total number of protons here.

However, $D_2$ seems a bit less common. Another common gas that fits a similar description is $H_2O$ (water vapor), but let us check:
- $H_2O$ (assuming $^1H$ and $^{16}O$): Total protons = $2 \times 1 + 8 = 10$, total mass number is $2 \times 1 + 16 = 18$, total neutrons is $18 - 10 = 8$, which makes the total number of neutrons not equal to the total number of protons here.

Another candidate is $D_2O$ (heavy water vapor):
- $D_2O$ (assuming $^2H$ and $^{16}O$): Total protons = $2 \times 1 + 8 = 10$, total mass number is $2 \times 2 + 16 = 20$, total neutrons is $20 - 10 = 10$, which makes the total number of neutrons equal to the total number of protons here.

However, a more common reaction that fits the "reacts violently with liquid Y" part is the reaction of an alkali metal such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), or potassium (K) with water (H$_2$O). 

However, the question mentions that "Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements." A well-known reaction that fits this description is the reaction of lithium (specifically lithium-6 or lithium-7) with water:
$$
2Li + 2H_2O \rightarrow 2LiOH + H_2
$$
However, the gas released here is $H_2$, which only makes the total number of neutrons equal to the total number of protons if it is $D_2$ (deuterium gas). 

However, another well-known reaction that fits the "reacts violently" part is the reaction of an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium with water. However, the reaction of sodium with water is:
$$
2Na + 2H_2O \rightarrow 2NaOH + H_2
$$
However, the question mentions that a "precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B." 

Another well-known reaction that fits the "reacts violently" part is the reaction of a metal hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH$_4$) with water:
$$
LiAlH_4 + 4H_2O \rightarrow LiOH + Al(OH)_3 + 4H_2
$$
However, here the gas released is still $H_2$, which makes us need to check the total number of neutrons and protons in $H_2$ again. 

However, a more likely candidate for a reaction that fits the "reacts violently" part might be a reaction where a gas such as $D_2$ is released. Another candidate for a "reacts violently" part could be a reaction such as that of a metal hydride like LiAlH$_4$, which is a well-known reducing agent in organic chemistry. 

However, the question mentions that "The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with the substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen." 

Another part of the question mentions that "The substance X and especially its very close analog is used as a reagent in organic chemistry." 

A well-known reagent used in organic chemistry that reacts with keto acids is lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH$_4$), which reduces keto acids to diols. However, the question mentions that the product of the reaction of a keto acid with substance X contains only two oxygen atoms. 

However, a keto acid such as pyruvic acid (CH$_3$COCOOH) reacts with a reducing agent like LiAlH$_4$:
$$
CH_3COCOOH \xrightarrow{LiAlH_4} CH_3CH(OH)CH_2OH
$$
However, the product here (1,2-propanediol) contains three oxygen atoms if we make a mistake in the reaction. Another reaction might be:
$$
CH_3COCOOH \xrightarrow{LiAlH_4} CH_3CH(OH)COOH
$$
However, the product here (lactic acid) still contains three oxygen atoms. 

However, a more common reaction might be:
$$
CH_3COCOOH + LiAlH_4 \rightarrow CH_3CH(OH)CH_2OH + LiAlO_2
$$
However, the question states that the product of the reaction should contain two oxygen atoms. 

Another part of the question mentions that "The melting point of B (under normal conditions) is very close to 277 K." 

The melting point of $277K$ is approximately $4^\circ C$. A well-known compound that has a melting point close to $277K$ is water (melting point $273.15K$). However, another compound that has a melting point close to $277K$ is $Al(OH)_3$, which decomposes upon heating to form $Al_2O_3$ and $H_2O$. 

However, the question states that "a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B." 

Based on the reaction $LiAlH_4 + 4H_2O \rightarrow LiOH + Al(OH)_3 + 4H_2$, the precipitate G could be $Al(OH)_3$, which upon heating decomposes as follows:
$$
2Al(OH)_3 \xrightarrow{\Delta} Al_2O_3 + 3H_2O
$$
The "B" here could be $H_2O$, which has a melting point of $273.15K$, which is close to $277K$.

However, the question also mentions that "Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements." 

The most common isotope of lithium is $^7Li$, while $^6Li$ is the less common one. For aluminum, the most common isotope is $^27Al$, which makes up nearly 100% of natural aluminum. For hydrogen, the most common isotope is $^1H$, while $^2H$ (deuterium) is a heavier isotope. 

Thus, "Substance X" could be lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH$_4$), where the "heavier isotope" could be deuterium (i.e., LiAlD$_4$). 

However, the question requires us to "calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." 

For LiAlH$_4$, the elements are lithium (Li), aluminum (Al), and hydrogen (H). 

The lightest element in LiAlH$_4$ is hydrogen (H), which has isotopes $^1H$ (protium, mass number 1), $^2H$ (deuterium, mass number 2), and $^3H$ (tritium, mass number 3). The most common isotope is $^1H$, which has a mass number of 1. 

The heaviest element in LiAlH$_4$ is aluminum (Al), which has a single stable isotope $^27Al$ (mass number 27).

However, the question states that "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." 

For LiAlH$_4$, the "cumulative atomic mass" for the lightest element (hydrogen) should be calculated for all four hydrogen atoms. 

The question mentions that "Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements." Thus, if we assume that the "heavier isotope" is deuterium for hydrogen, the question seems to imply that the "heavier isotope" should be used for one of the elements in LiAlH$_4$. 

However, the question requires us to sum the atomic masses of the "heavier and lighter isotopes" for the lightest and heaviest elements in the compound. 

#### For the lightest element (hydrogen) in LiAlH$_4$:
- The most common isotope is $^1H$ (mass number 1).
- Another isotope is $^2H$ (mass number 2).
- Another isotope is $^3H$ (mass number 3).

However, the question states that "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." 

This means that for the four hydrogen atoms in LiAlH$_4$, we need to sum the masses of all the isotopes for the four hydrogen atoms. However, the question seems a bit ambiguous here. It seems that we need to sum the mass numbers of all the isotopes for the "lightest" and "heaviest" elements in the compound. 

However, the question seems to be asking us to sum the mass numbers of all the isotopes for the "lightest" and "heaviest" elements present in the compound. 

The "lightest" element in LiAlH$_4$ is hydrogen (atomic mass approximately 1), and the "heaviest" element is aluminum (atomic mass approximately 27). 

However, the question states that "Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements." 

However, the question seems to be asking us to sum the mass numbers of all the isotopes for the "lightest" element (which is hydrogen) and the "heaviest" element (which is aluminum). 

#### For hydrogen (lightest element in LiAlH$_4$):
- $^1H$ (protium) has a mass number of 1.
- $^2H$ (deuterium) has a mass number of 2.
- $^3H$ (tritium) has a mass number of 3.

However, the question states that "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." 

This means that for the four hydrogen atoms in LiAlH$_4$, if we need to sum the mass numbers of all the isotopes for the four hydrogen atoms, it seems that the question is asking us to sum the mass numbers of $^1H$, $^2H$, and $^3H$ for the four hydrogen atoms. 

However, what we need here is the "cumulative atomic mass" for the lightest element (hydrogen) in LiAlH$_4$. 

The question seems to be asking us to sum the mass numbers of all the isotopes for the "lightest" element (hydrogen) and the "heaviest" element (aluminum) in the compound. 

#### For aluminum (heaviest element in LiAlH$_4$):
- The only stable isotope is $^27Al$ (mass number 27).

However, the question states that "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." 

However, there is only one aluminum atom in LiAlH$_4$, so the "cumulative atomic mass" for aluminum should be:
$$
27
$$
(Since there is only one stable isotope $^27Al$, the "cumulative atomic mass" for aluminum is just the mass number of $^27Al$, which is $27$.)

However, for hydrogen, there are four hydrogen atoms in LiAlH$_4$. 

The question states that "Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements." 

However, the question seems to be asking us to sum the mass numbers of all the isotopes for the "lightest" element (hydrogen) where there are four hydrogen atoms in LiAlH$_4$.
