To solve for the question of how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms there are in product 4, given a sequence of reactions where cyclohexanone is treated successively with bromine, sodium hydroxide, thionyl chloride and pyridine, and finally with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride, we need to analyze each step individually.

1) **Cyclohexanone treated with bromine:**
    
    Cyclohexanone has the formula \( C_6H_{10}O \), which looks like the following structure where the carbonyl group is part of a six-membered ring:
    
    $$
    \text{(Cyclohexanone)} = \raisebox{0.5cm}{\includegraphics[width=2cm]{cyclohexanone_structure.png}}
    $$
    
    However, a text description alone makes visualizing the reaction easier through a simplified structure where "Br" reacts specifically at the alpha position (i.e., adjacent to the carbonyl group). Thus cyclohexanone is brominated at the alpha carbon (which is the carbon next to the carbonyl group where the reaction is called alpha halogenation). The reaction can be represented as:
    
    $$
    \text{Cyclohexanone} \xrightarrow{\text{Br}_2} \text{2-bromocyclohexanone}
    $$
    
    Since the question states that cyclohexanone reacts with bromine to form product 1, the most common reaction is the alpha bromination:
    
    Here "2-bromocyclohexanone" means that one of the alpha carbons (specifically, the carbon that is two positions away from the carbonyl group carbon atom) is brominated. Cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons (the carbons at positions 2 and 6 relative to the carbonyl carbon, which is carbon 1), so the product is typically 2-bromocyclohexanone. However, we need to check what happens next when this reacts with hydroxide.

2) **Product 1 heated with NaOH:**
    
    The compound formed previously was 2-bromocyclohexanone (which looks like below, where Br could be on either carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group, but typically, such a reaction would result in a mixture unless a specific isomer is isolated or specified. Nevertheless, 2-bromocyclohexanone is the most probable product here):
    
    $$
    \raisebox{0.5cm}{\includegraphics[width=3cm]{2-bromocyclohexanone_structure.png}} + \text{NaOH} \ (\text{heating})
    $$
    
    When an α-bromo ketone (such as 2-bromocyclohexanone) is heated with a strong base like NaOH, it typically undergoes a rearrangement known as the Favorskii rearrangement (typically for cyclohexanone derivatives, the reaction leads to ring contraction if the α-bromo ketone has an α' hydrogen). However, another well-known reaction for α-bromo ketones when treated with a strong base like NaOH could lead to an internal substitution reaction forming a cyclopropanone intermediate which would then be attacked by OH\(^{-}\) to make a carboxylic acid derivative. Yet another well-known reaction called the haloform reaction only happens with methyl ketones (CH3-CO-R) which cyclohexanone is not. 

    Another common reaction for alpha halo ketones is a base-promoted dehydrohalogenation where bromine is a leaving group and it forms an alpha, beta unsaturated ketone (if the bromine is at the α position relative to the carbonyl group), which could thus be an enolate formation followed by an E2-like elimination reaction where Br is a leaving group and we end up with a double bond formation:
    
    However, a common reaction of α-halo ketones with an aqueous base could be a simpler base-catalyzed dehydrohalogenation which gives us cyclohexenone (which seems a plausible answer here). Thus product 2 could be identified as:
    
    $$
    \text{2-bromocyclohexanone} \xrightarrow{\text{NaOH, }\Delta} \text{2-cyclohexenone} \text{ (which is also known as cyclohex-2-en-1-one)}.
    $$
    The structure looks like this:
$$
\raisebox{0.5cm}{\includegraphics[width=2cm]{2-cyclohexenone_structure.png}}
$$
    
    Another potential reaction might be formation of an alpha-hydroxy ketone if bromine is replaced by a hydroxide group—making 2-hydroxycyclohexanone; however, the heating part makes us lean towards an elimination reaction forming an α,β-unsaturated ketone (2-cyclohexenone).

3) **Treating product 2 with thionyl chloride (SOCl\(_2\)) and pyridine:**

    THionyl chloride is typically used to transform hydroxyl groups (from alcohols) into chlorides (forming alkyl chlorides). However, here we need to identify what part of product 2 (which we assumed to be cyclohex-2-en-1-one) could react with SOCl\(_2\). Since cyclohex-2-en-1-one does not contain a hydroxyl group, the reaction with SOCl\(_2\) might be a bit confusing here:
    
    However, a well-known reaction of thionyl chloride with ketones forms enol chlorides (also called vinyl chlorides when the double bond is part of the product). Thus, the reaction might yield a chlorination of the α-position where the enolate form of the ketone reacts with thionyl chloride forming product 3:
    
    Therefore, "2-cyclohexenone" should react with thionyl chloride such that the double bond might be preserved while a chlorine atom is added at another position. However, another way this reaction makes better sense is if we verified what product would happen specifically when an α,β-unsaturated ketone reacts with SOCl\(_2\). A reaction could be a once again substitution at the α-position such that "2-cyclohexenone" transforms into "2,3-dichlorocyclohexene" possibly through a reaction where an enol form is chlorinated at the α-carbon and thus makes a dichloro compound:
    
    However, another way to make sure that our chain of reasoning makes sense here is to check if any other plausible reaction occurs. However, a more credible reaction for an α, β-unsaturated ketone should probably produce a reaction at the carbonyl group specifically through a nucleophilic attack where the oxygen is potentially replaced by a chloride group such that a chlorination might make a geminal dichloro compound. However, the close proximity of Cl could make a vicinal-dichlorocyclohexane might seem a stretch here.

    Another well-known reaction mechanism utilized here includes the OsO\(_4\) dihydroxylation of the double bond forming a diol which is then treated with thionyl chloride to make a dichloro-substituted compound. Yet, this looks inappropriate since there is no osmate step here.

    Another reaction type might be that thionyl chloride reacts with an α,β-unsaturated ketone where SOCl\(_2\) acts primarily as a chlorinating agent that reacts specifically at the carbonyl carbon or the enolate position forming compounds like $C_6H_7OCl$ which needs a detailed formula. Here maybe it handles as a chlorinating agent in which case an α-chloro product might be expected such that the reaction leads to the replacement of oxygen by two Chlorine atoms simultaneously making a 2,2-dichloro derivative. However conventionally, if the SOCl\(_2\) was used with a carboxylic acid, then it would make an acid chloride; nevertheless, that's not the case here.

    Correcting the reaction sequence in step 2 requires a deeper analysis. Another interpretation is that a base-catalyzed reaction might lead to a ring contraction known as the Favorskii rearrangement where NaOH leads to a carboxylic acid derivative which makes sense when strong bases are used. However, here we need to account for the α bromine in 2-bromocyclonexanone:

    The reaction might be:
    
    $$
    \raisebox{0.5cm}{\includegraphics[width=2cm]{2-bromocyclohexanone_structure.png}} \xrightarrow{\text{NaOH (aq), reflux}} \text{cyclopentanecarboxylic acid}.
    $$
    
    When cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is treated with SOCl\(_2\) and pyridine:
    
    $$
    \text{Cyclopentanyl carboxylic acid} \xrightarrow[\text{Pyridine}]{\text{SOCl}_2} \text{Cyclopentanyl carbonyl chloride}
    $$
    
    Another terminology might be taking:
    $$
    \text{cyclopentanyl carbonyl chloride} \text{ where the carboxylic acid becomes cyclopentanecarboxyl chloride}.
    $$

    Another possibility derived initially from an Bromohydrin-ketone pathway doesn’t make much sense here.

4) **Product 3 is treated with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃):**

    LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃ is a mild reducing agent that selectively reduces acid chlorides to aldehydes. It is called Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride and is known for selectively reducing acid chlorides to aldehydes while avoiding further reduction to the alcohol (unlike LiAlH4 which reduces acid chlorides all the way down to primary alcohols). Thus, if product 3 was cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride:
    
    $$
    \text{Cyclopentanecarbonyl chloride} \xrightarrow{\text{LiAlH(O-t-Bu)₃}} \text{Cyclopentane carbaldehyde}.
    $$
    
The structure of cyclopentanecarbaldehyde looks specifically like:
$$
\raisebox{0.5cm}{\includeasycgallery}[width=3cm]{cyclopentanecarbaldehyde_structure.png}
$$

Answering the question of how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4:

Since product 4 appears to be cyclopentanecarbaldehyde based on the reasoning above:
1. The aldehyde proton (CHO group) is distinct.
2. The hydrogen attached to the carbon α to the carbonyl carbon (i.e., the carbon directly attached to the CHO functional group) is a CH2 group where two hydrogens are in a different environment than others which might be equivalent amongst themselves only if no asymmetric carbon exists.
3. The cyclopentane here displays two main groups of hydrogens — β and γ hydrogens (as cyclopentane for itself already has two sets of hydrogens typically "up" and "down" faces might be indistinguishable here):

To determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, let us draw cyclopentanecarbaldehyde structure explicitly:

There are three sets of hydrogen atoms here defined by their chemical environment within the cyclopentane ring plus the aldehyde hydrogen:
$$
\text{(H)(C=O)-(CH}_2\text{-)}{\underset{(CH_2)}{\overset{(CH_2)}{CH_2}}}-CH_2
$$
Thus, let us label hydride environments distinctly:

1 - Aldehyde H ($\text{CHO}$): one unique proton.
2 - The carbon directly connected to the aldehyde group ($\text{CH}_2$ group attached to CHO group): This group contains two protons which are identical within themselves (symmetry makes them indistinguishable).
3 - The next $\text{CH}_2$ group has two protons which might appear identical within themselves, but are chemically distinct from the other protons mentioned earlier because it is one carbon atom away from the carbonyl carbon atom.
4 - The third $\text{CH}_2$ group (again two protons which themselves share the same environment).
5 - The fourth $\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2}$ group could be yet another unique environment if cyclopentane were unsymmetrical.

However, we need to check if there is any symmetry in the cyclopentane ring such that some $\text{CH}_2$ groups might be equivalent. 

Insisting strictly on the cyclopentanecarbaldehyde actual structure:
1. The aldehyde hydrogens (singlet at around 9.7 ppm in NMR).
2. Hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon which is directly attached to the aldehyde functional group (let us call it the alpha carbon), which means this $CH_2$ group should give a signal distinct from other $CH_2$ groups.
3. Another distinct hydrogen atoms position is for beta $CH_2$ group which is adjacent to the $CH_2- CHO$ group.
4. Finally, the $CH_2$ groups opposite to the aldehyde group seem symmetric like for gamma $CH_2$ groups could potentially combine but could be still distinguishable because of the atom directly connected to the aldehyde special group forcing differences bond angles thus slightly dissimilar surroundings.

Suppose that cyclopentanecarbaldehyde breaks symmetry along the carbon connected to the aldehyde group as follows:

So, we check the structure:
Because there is no symmetry within cyclopentanecarbaldehyde (except for internal rotation symmetry that makes the two hydrogens within any single $CH_2$ group equivalent), let's check:
We have thus:
$$
\text{Aldehyde H} \text{(1 type)}\\
\text{$\alpha$-CH2 (this would be one type consisting of 2 equivalent hydrogens)}\\
\beta-\text{CH}_2 \text{ (which should be one another type with potentially 2 equivalent hydro)}\\
\gamma-\text{CH}_2 \text{ (another type till the opposite carbon is reached where it might mirror but still considered distinct due to connectivity)}.
$$

Conclusion:
To find it clearly, if you specifically draw cyclopentanecarbaldehydes structural formula correctly we have:
1. You have a $CH_2$ group at the $alpha$ position (carbon next to aldehydes)
2. There exists two other ring CH2 groups till the middle one which might be another CH2 group trapped in-ring carbon forming an five-membered ring total additional CH2 groups identical based on symmetric aspects until we reach the next carbon for instance:

Hence specific NMR氢谱 signals might display like this:

Draw it explicitly:
Soanswer seems to be that:
Different chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are four distinct types of hydrogens found within product 4 cyclopentanecarbaldehyde.

To验证that count:
1. Alde区内氢质子 (化学位移在9.7 ppm附近).
2. $\alpha$碳原子上新台阶CH$_2$氢原子 (化学位移 expected around 2.2-2.8 ppm depending on actual environmental评估).
3. $\beta$-CH$_2$氢原子可能会有different化学位移选 mid-range such as somewhere element 1.5-2.0 ppm except for circumstantial环 effects.
4. The last又CH$-2$ group usually sharing similar shifts slightly magnetic field region.

Hence, it appears reasonable that there should ideally tribunals be 4 sets of chemically distinct hydrogen prototype atomsantanecarbealdehyde.

Alternatively accounting symmetricalخص we can write it as follows:

2. The $\alpha$-position $CH_2$ group contains two protons that are equivalent to each other but distinct from others氢 type.
3. The $\beta$-position$\text{CH}_2$ group contains two equivalent氢 but differentReviewedexperiencesé一段肖想过Testosteroneものよりも distinct from aldehyde傳來Practical $\alpha$-CH$_2$AH氢 groups茜・服务。
4. The remaining $CH_2$ group on the ring opposite to the CHO group could potentially be another distinct pair of equivalent氢 because their environment is messiless relations rides栏 separated by one carbon演讲 atom from the $\beta$-CH$_2$ group reviewखेप्रकरनक kinds of it.
