# Original Question

Which of the following stars can be detected with both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory? Please refer to the links below for more information about the observatories. It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.

To solve whether a star can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory or the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we need to verify two main conditions for each star:

1. The star should be visible from both observatories. This requires checking the declination (DEC) of the star against the latitude of the observatories (since the question mentions that we should ignore pointing limits such as maximum and minimum elevations and altitudes of the telescopes, what matters here essentially is that the star should ideally be observable from both observatories' geographic locations).

2. The star's apparent V magnitude should be brighter than a given threshold (which is 17 mag for ESPRESSO and 16 mag for HIRES).

Let us verify the visibility for each observatory based on their latitude.

#### Paranal Observatory (located in Cerro Paranal, Chile)
- Latitude: 24 degrees south (approximately 24° 37' 39'' S, so roughly -24.6 degrees).
- Longitude: 70 degrees west (70° 24' 15'' W).

#### Keck Observatory (located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA)
- Latitude: 19.8 degrees north (approximately 19° 49' N, so roughly 19.8 degrees).
- Longitude: 155.5 degrees west (155° 28' W, so roughly 155.5 degrees).

However, since the question states that we should ignore the "pointing limits such as maximum and minimum elevations of the telescopes," what matters primarily here is that a star is "generally visible" from both Northern and Southern Hemispherical locations unless it is located very close to the celestial pole. 

However, stars can be visible down to a declination of `90 - latitude` in the opposite hemisphere (i.e., for Paranal at -24.6 degrees latitude, stars with declinations from about -90 to +65.4 degrees (since `90 - 24.6 = 65.4`) should be visible at some point during the year. For Keck at latitude `19.8` degrees north, stars with declinations from about `-70.2` (which calculates as `19.8 - 90`) to +90 degrees should be visible at some point in the year. 

That should make stars which fall within a declination range of roughly -70.2 to +65.4 degrees (overlap of the two given observatory viewing ranges) visible by both observatories. Any star outside this range might only be visible from one of these two observatories. Thus, a star should be approximately within the declination range of `-70.2` to `+65.4` for it to be "visible" from both locations (excluding the part about pointing limits).

Another necessary condition is that the star should have an apparent V magnitude such that:
- For ESPRESSO at Paranal, stars need an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17 mag.
- For HIRES at Keck, stars need an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 mag.

This means that a star needs to be brighter than V=16 mag for Keck and brighter than V=17 mag for Paranal. Since we need the star to be observable by both, the more stringent constraint here is having an apparent V magnitude brighter than 16 mag (since if a star has apparent V mag < 16 it fits both criteria).

Let us analyze star by star. For any star with given apparent V magnitude $m_V$, absolute V magnitude $M_V$, distance $ d$ (in parsecs $pc$), and total absorption $A_V$, the apparent magnitude $m_V$ can be calculated if only the absolute magnitude $M_V$ and distance $d$ are given by the formula:
$$m_V - M_V = 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 + A_V,$$
where $A_V$ is the total absorption in the V band. If $E(B-V)$ represents the color excess in B-V, the total absorption in the V band $A_V$ is given by:
$$A_V = R_V \cdot E(B-V),$$
where $R_V = 3.1$.

#### Star1:
- RA = 15 deg, DEC = -75 deg.
- Absolute V magnitude $M_V$ = 15.5 mag.
- Distance $d$ = 10 pc.

Calculate the apparent V magnitude $m_V$ ignoring any absorption $A_V$ (since $E(B-V)$ is not given, assume $A_V = 0$):
$$m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(dist) - 5 + A_V$$
Plug in $M_V = 15.5$, $d=10$, $A_V=0$:
$$m_V = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5$$
$$m_V = 15.5 + 5 \times 1 - 5$$
$$m_V = 15.5 + 5 - 5$$
$$m_V = 15.5.$$
This star's DEC is -75 deg, which is outside the overlapping declination range of -70.2 to +65.4 degrees (since -75 < -70.2). Hence, Star1 may only be visible from the Paranal Observatory (since it lies in the Southern Hemisphere). However, its apparent V magnitude of 15.5 is bright enough for both ESPRESSO ($< 17$ mag) and HIRES ($< 16$ mag).

#### Star2:
- RA = 30 deg, DEC = 55 deg.
- Apparent V magnitude $m_V$ = 16.5 mag.
- Distance $d$ = 5 pc.

The star has a DEC of 55 deg which is well within the overlapping declination range of -70.2 to +65.4 (i.e., visible potentially from both observatories). However, the star has an apparent V magnitude of $16.5$ mag. This is brighter than the 17 mag limit for ESPRESSO, but it is brighter than 16 mag only by half a magnitude for HIRES. Thus, Star2 is eligible for observation by ESPRESSO (since $16.5 < 17$), but not for HIRES (since $16.5 > 16$).

#### Star3:
- RA = 11 h (=165 deg, since 1 hour RA corresponds to 15 degrees, so $11 \cdot 15 = 165$ degrees), DEC = 48 deg.
- Apparent V magnitude $m_V$ = 15.5 mag.
- $E(B-V) = 0.6$ mag.
- Distance $d$ = 15 pc.

First, calculate $A_V$:
$$A_V = R_V \times E(B-V)$$
$$A_V = 3.1 \times 0.6$$
$$A_V = 1.86.$$
However, for this star, the apparent V magnitude is already given as $15.5$ mag. However, it's important to make sure what "apparent V magnitude" here means. Usually, "apparent magnitude" refers to the observed (after any extinction effects due to interstellar dust) magnitude. Thus, the given $15.5$ mag should already include the effects of $A_V$. Let us double-check this reasoning through a consistency check where we validate what the $m_V$ would be if no extinction effect had been included previously:
Calculating the absolute magnitude $M_V$ from the given apparent $m_V$ including $A_V$ effects:
$$\text{if } A_V = 1.86, \text{ what should be the "unreddened" apparent magnitude $m_{V0}$?}$$
$$m_{V0} = m_V - A_V.$$
Here $m_V = 15.5$ mag should already account for the $1.86$ mag of extinction:
$$m_V (\text{if there were no extinction}) = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64.$$
Yet another way round, what should be the $m_V$ if we assume that $m_V = 15.5$ mag refers to the "unreddened" apparent magnitude $m_{V0}$:
$$m_V (\text{including extinction}) = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36.$$

However, this makes $17.36$ for "observed" $m_V$ (including extinction) which makes it too faint for HIRES ($17.36 > 16$) and slightly too faint even for ESPRESSO ($17.36 > 17$). But the question states that the "apparent magnitude" means already including any optical depth effects such as $A_V$, thus the star has an observed $m_V = 15.5$ mag including $A_V$. Thus, this star **should be clearly observable by ESPRESSO**, because $15.5 < 17$, and also by HIRES because $15.5 < 16$. 

However, before making a decision, verify the visibility based on declination. The DEC is 48 degrees which is within the overlapping declination range (-70.2 to +65.4). 

#### Star4:
- RA = 85 deg, DEC = -48 deg.
- Absolute V magnitude $M_V$ = 15.5mag.
- $E(B-V) = 0.4$ mag.
- Distance $d$ = 10 pc.

First, calculate $A_V$:
$$A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4$$
$$A_V = 1.24.$$
Now, calculate the apparent V magnitude $m_V$ including $A_V$:
$$m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 + A_V$$
$$m_V = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 + 1.24$$
$$m_V = 15.5 + 5 - 5 + 1.24$$
$$m_V = 16.74.$$
The DEC = -48 deg is within the overlapping declination range (-70.2 to +65.4). However, $m_V = 16.74$. Thus:
- For ESPRESSO ($<17$ mag), $16.74 < 17$, so it can be detected.
- For HIRES ($<16$ mag), $16.74 > 16$, so it cannot be detected.

#### Star5:
- RA = 10 h (=150 deg, since $10 \times 15 = 150$), DEC = 60 deg.
- Absolute V magnitude $M_V$ = 16.5 mag.
- Distance $d$ = 5 pc.

Calculate the apparent V magnitude $m_V$ (assuming $A_V=0$) because $E(B-V)$ is not given for this star:
$$m_V = M_V + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5$$
$$m_V = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5$$
$$m_V = 16.5 + 5 \times 0.69897 - 5$$
$$m_V = 16.5 + 5 \times 0.69897 - 5$$
$$m_V = 16.5 + 3.49485 - 5$$
$$m_V ≈ 16.5 + 3.5 - 5$$
$$m_V ≈ 15.$$

DEC = 60 deg is within the overlapping declination range -70.2 to $+65.4^\circ$ (verified previously thus it should be observable from both observatories). 

Apparent magnitude $m_V$ threshold:
- Since $m_V$ is $15$, it satisfies both ESPRESSO's $<17$ mag ($15 < 17$) and HIRES' $<16$ mag ($15 < 16$) criteria.

Based on the reasoning above, the stars that can be observed both from ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck should satisfy both observatories' magnitude limits and be within the visible declination ranges for both locations. 

Based on what we calculated:
#### Star1:
- Visible only from Paranal due to declination -75 deg.
- Apparent V magnitude 15.5 mag fits both $<17$ mag (ESPRESSO) and $<16$ mag (error in reasoning here).

#### Star2:
- Visible from both observatories (DEC = 55 deg).
- Apparent V magnitude 16.5 mag fits for ESPRESSO ($16.5 < 17$) but not for HIRES ($16.5 > 16$).
    
#### Star3:
- Visible from both observatories (DEC = 48 deg).
- Apparent V magnitude 15.5 mag fits ESPRESSO ($15.5 < 17$) and HIRES ($15.5 < 16$).

#### Star4:
- Visible from both observatories (DEC = -48 deg).
- Apparent V magnitude 16.74 mag fits ESPRESSO ($16.74 < 17$) but not HIRES ($16.74 > 16$).
    
    
#### Star5:
- Visible from both observatories (DEC = 60 deg).
- Apparent V magnitude is approximately $15$, which fits both ESPRESSO ($15 < 17$) and HIRES ($15 < 16$).
    
However, for Star1, the statement “Star1 may only be visible from the Paranal Observatory” seems a bit too strong here given what "ignore pointing limits" might imply. Another important check here is that a star with a declination of -75 degrees might still be visible from Hawaii (Keck) given such a declination is only a few degrees from Keck’s lower limit (-70.2 degrees). Given that the question mentions that pointing limits should be ignored effectively, the real determinant should primarily be the apparent V magnitude.

However, what seems most relevant here is that within the question context where "pointing limits" are ignored, "visible" mainly means whether or not a star is reasonable close to observable declination ranges such that we need to check if a star is "potentially" visible from both observatories such that their apparent V magnitude makes them detectable. 

However, a star with a declination $\delta$, such that $|\delta | > 90^\circ - |\text{latitude}|$, is theoretically not visible because it's always below the horizon. Thus Star1 is unlikely observable from Mauna Kea (latitude $19.8^\circ$N), requiring a declination greater than $19.8 - 90 =-70.2^\circ$, whereas Star1 is at declination $-75^\circ$. Thus Star1 should only be visible predominantly from Paranal (located at $-24.6^\circ$ latitude) where the star’s declination of $-75^\circ$ makes it visible since:


Compute the condition needed for Paranal (latitude -24.6 deg north):
1. Any star with DEC ranges from $-90^{\circ}$ to $(90^\circ - |-24.6^\circ|)$, which translates to a declination from $-90^\circ$ to $65.4^\circ$.

So, to make a star "visible" from both Paranal and Keck, it should satisfy $−70.2^\circ < \delta < +65.4^\circ$ (which brings us to the following conclusion).

So let us verify:
1. Star1 has DEC=-75 deg and hence appears only visible from Paranal.
2. Star2 has $m_V = 16.5$, making it too faint for HIRES.
3. Star3 appears $m_V = 15.5$ mag and is visible from both observatories as it satisfies both magnitude limits.
4. Star4 has $m_V = 16.74$, making it too faint for HIRES.
5. Star5 seems to have an apparent V magnitude of $15$ and satisfies both magnitude limits as well as it is visible from both observatories.

Based on the question, stars satisfying all the given conditions (being visible from both observatories and fitting within magnitude limits) appear to be:
- Star3: RA = 11 h (165deg), DEC = 48 deg, $m_V = 15.5$.
- Star5: RA = 10 h (150 deg), DEC = 60 deg, $m_V ≈ 15$.

However, this question seems to require us to make sure that:
1. The declination ensures that the star is visible from both observatories.
2. The apparent V magnitude is such that it is brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and also brighter than 16 mag for HIRES.

Verifying again against the question:
Star3 and Star5 satisfy all conditions (visible from both observatories and within the apparent V magnitude limits for both spectrographs).

Based on our verified reasoning, it seems Star3 and Star5 are candidates that meet the given requirements. However, we need confirmation through checking one final round of the calculations (since the reasoning should validate one star from the given options).

Based on the options, it seems only Star3 and Star5 make the cut. However, it seems that all stars except Star2 have their apparent V magnitude as an item to be calculated explicitly where needed where $16.74$, $15.5$, and $15$ seems like results of when absolute magnitudes are given. 

However, another round of "consistency check" can confirm:
Checking Star3 "apparent V magnitude already given as $15.5$ and that should already include $A_V$. Thus, $15.5 < 16$ and $15.5 < 17$, so Star3 seems valid.

So Star5:
1. $d=5$ pc.
2. $M_V=16.5$ mag:
$$
m_v \approx 15 = 16.5 + 5 \cdot \log_{10} (5) - 5.
$$
Calculates:
$$
\log_{10}5 \approx 0.6990,
\\
5 \cdot 0.6990 = 3.495,
\\
16.5 + 3.495 - 5 ≈ 14.995.
$$
Thus $\approx 15$ works here so:
- $15 < 16$
- $15 < 17$

Seems verified correctly.

Based on this, Star3 and Star5 both satisfy the question requirements where they must be detectable both by Keck and Paranal. But what should be carefully verified here is:
If only one stellar candidate that satisfies both conditions is required, the question implicitly asks us which specific star option ("Star1," "Star2,", "Star3," "Star4," or "Star5") fits the question description fully (observable from both observatories and correct apparent magnitudes). Another check is needed:

1. **Star1**: DEC -75° makes it only visible from Paranal. Thus, Star1 fails.
2. **Star2**: Apparent V mag $16.5$ makes it too faint for HIRES (16.5 mag), thus not detectable by both.
3. **Star3**: DEC 48° makes it visible from both; apparent
