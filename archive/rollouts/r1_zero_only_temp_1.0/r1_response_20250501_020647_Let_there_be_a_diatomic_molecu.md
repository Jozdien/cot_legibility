# Original Question

Let there be a diatomic molecule, with elements X and Y, that can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model). If the molecule is in its fundamental state, what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy?
Mx: mass of atom X = 20 amu
My: mass of atom Y = 2 amu
R: molecular bond length = 2 angstroms
w: angular frequency of vibration = 4*10^14 rad/s

To tackle the question about the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule composed of atoms X and Y (with masses $M_X$ and $M_Y$), we need to identify the energy levels associated with rotational and vibrational states. The question mentions several given values:

- Mass of atom X: $M_X = 20$ atomic mass units (amu).
- Mass of atom Y: $M_Y = 2$ amu.
- Molecular bond length (equilibrium separation): $R = 2$ angstroms ($2 \times 10^{-10}$ meters).
- Angular frequency of vibration: $\omega = 4 \times 10^{14}\, \text{rad/s}$.

The objective is to find the momentum of a photon that should be absorbed by a molecule initially in its fundamental (lowest energy) state such that the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

To analyze rotation-vibration (or ro-vibrational) states, we need to recall the total energy expression for a diatomic molecule in the non-rigid rotor model (which includes both rotational and vibrational contributions combined):

$$E_{v,J} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega + B_e J(J+1)\hbar^2 - D_e [J(J+1)]^2 \hbar^2,$$
where $B_e$ is the rotational constant (usually defined as $B_e = \frac{\hbar}{2I}$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia $I = \mu R^2$), $v$ is the vibrational quantum number (typically $v = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$), $J$ is the rotational quantum number ($J = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$), and $D_e$ is the centrifugal distortion constant (which is usually small and thus part of the "non-rigid rotor" term).

However, the first term (which includes the term $\left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \omega$) describes the vibrational energy. The second term $B_e J(J+1)\hbar^2$ is the usual rigid rotor term where $B_e = \frac{\hbar}{2I}$ is typically defined as $B_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}$ (note that $B_e$ here should be in units of energy rather than frequency, so a more common form is indeed $B_e = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}$. However, another common form for the rotational energy is $B_e h J(J+1)$, where $B_e$ is now in units of $\text{s}^{-1}$ (thus, $B_e h J(J+1)$ yields an energy term).

Another well-known form for the harmonic oscillator part is:
$$
E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega.
$$
And for the rotational part (rigid rotor approximation):
$$
E_{\text{rot}} = B J(J+1),
$$
where $B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}$ is the rotational constant.

For a diatomic molecule where $B$ is typically defined as:
$$
B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \text{ (in energy units), where } I = \mu R^2,
$$
and $\mu$ is the reduced mass given by:
$$
\mu = \frac{M_X M_Y}{M_X + M_Y}.
$$
Using the given masses $M_X = 20$ amu and $M_Y = 2$ amu (note that $1\text{ amu} \approx 1.6605 \times 10^{-27}$ Kg):
$$
\mu = \frac{M_X \times M_Y}{M_X + M_Y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \text{ amu} = \frac{40}{22} \text{ amu} \approx \frac{40}{22} \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}.
$$
We round here the calculated reduced mass as follows:
$$
\mu \simeq 1.818 \text{ amu} \text{ (in atomic mass units)}.
$$
$$
\mu \text{(in kg)} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}.
$$
The moment of inertia $I$ can be calculated from the given bond length $R$:
$$
I = \mu R^2.
$$
Given $R = 2\, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}$,
$$
I = (3.018 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg})(2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m})^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \times 4 \times 10^{-20} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m}^2,
$$
$$
I = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
$$

The rotational constant $B$ is given by:
$$
B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}.
$$
where $\hbar \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}$:
$$
B = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 1.2072 \times 10^{-46}} \text{ J}.
$$
$$
B = \frac{1.1109 \times 10^{-68}}{2 \times 1.2072 \times 10^{-46}} \text{ J}.
$$
$$
B \approx 4.602 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}.
$$
To make it easier to compare, let us express $B$ in $\text{eV}$ (since $1 \text{ eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$):
$$
B \text{ (in eV)} \approx \frac{4.602 \times 10^{-23}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \text{ eV} \approx 2.872 \times 10^{-4} \text{ eV}.
$$
This gives us a rotational energy term:
$$
E_{\text{rot}} = B J(J+1) \text{ (energy units)}
$$
However, a more usual expression for $B$ is usually defined in units of frequency ($s^{-1}$), where rotational energy becomes:
$$
E_{\text{rot}} = B h J(J+1) \text{ (where $B$ is in $s^{-1}$ and $h$ is Planck’s constant)}.
$$
However, a more typical form used for rotational energy is:
$$
E_{\text{rot}} = B_e h J(J+1) \text{ where here $B_e$ is usually given in cm$^{-1}$}.
$$
Note that here we need $B$ in energy units (Joules). Another way to express $B$ in terms of wavenumber is:
$$
\tilde{B} = \frac{B}{hc} \text{ (in units of cm$^{-1}$)},
$$
where $h$ is Planck’s constant and $c$ is the speed of light. So, once $B$ has been found in energy units (Joules), we need to find the energy needed for the transition from the fundamental state to the next state with the lowest higher energy.

However, for our considerations here, the question should be interpreted primarily as follows:
1. The "fundamental state" corresponds to the lowest energy state where both $v$ and $J$ are typically minimized. For a diatomic molecule, this would typically be $v=0$ for vibrational part and $J=0$ for rotational part.

Thus, the fundamental state (i.e., the lowest-energy state) is $v=0$ and $J=0$. The total energy for this state is:
$$
E_{0,0} = \left(0 + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \omega + B \times 0 \times (0+1) = \frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega.
$$
To analyze what "next state with the lowest possible energy" implies, let us compare the increments from the rotational and vibrational energies.

The energy increase from $v=0$ to $v=1$ (keeping $J=0$) could be:
$$
E_{1,0} = \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega + B \times 0 \times (0+1) = \dfrac{3}{2} \hbar \omega.
$$
The energy difference for this transition is:
$$
\Delta E_{0,0 \to 1,0} = E_{1,0} - E_{0,0} = \frac{3}{2}\hbar\omega - \frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega = \hbar\omega.
$$
Another possible transition might be keeping $v=0$ but increasing $J$:
$$
E_{0,1} = \left(0 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega + BJ(J+1) = \dfrac{1}{2}\hbar \omega + 2B \text{ (since $J=1$, thus $B \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 2B$)}.
$$
The energy difference for the $0,0\to 0,1$ transition is:
$$
\Delta E_{0,0 \to 0,1} = E_{0,1} - E_{0,0} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\hbar \omega + 2B\right) - \frac{1}{2}\hbar \omega = 2B.
$$
So, we need to compare $\hbar\omega$ (energy required for $0,0\to1,0$) versus $2B$ (energy required for $0,0\to0,1$).

We computed $B \approx 4.602 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}$. Thus we need now to compare the two energy differences:
$$
\hbar\omega \text{ vs. } 2B.
$$
For $\hbar\omega$:
$$
\hbar \omega = (1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}) \times (4 \times 10^{14} \text{ rad/s}) \approx 4.216 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J}.
$$
For $2B$:
$$
2B \approx 2 \times 4.602 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J} \approx 9.204 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}.
$$
We need obviously to compare these two values:
$$
\hbar \omega \approx 4.216 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J} \text{ (which is for $0,0 \to 1,0$ transition)}.
$$
$$
2B \approx 9.204 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J} \text{ (which is for $0,0 \to 0,1$ transition)}.
$$
Clearly:
$$
2B \ll \hbar\omega.
$$
(This makes sense because rotational energy spacings are typically much smaller than vibrational energy spacings.)

So, the next state with the lowest energy above the fundamental state $v=0$, $J=0$ is likely $v=0$, $J=1$. So let us calculate the energy of $2B$ in more convenient units:
$$
2B \text{ (in joules)} \approx 9.204 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}.
$$
The question requires us to find the "momentum" of an absorbed photon that makes the molecule transition from $(v=0,J=0)$ to $(v=0,J=1)$. 

The photon momentum $p$ can be found using:
$$
p = \frac{E}{c}.
$$
Here $E$ is the energy difference for the $0,0\to0,1$ transition (which we determined was $2B$). Hence:
$$
p = \frac{2B}{c}.
$$
Since $2B \approx 9.204 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}$ and $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$:
$$
p = \frac{9.204 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \approx 3.068 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
$$

Therefore, the answer should be verified here if making sense:

Let us verify the question again whether the answer makes intuitive sense -- what is the wavelength of the photon if the transition yields such a small energy difference:
$$
\lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E} = \frac{hc}{2B}.
$$
$$
\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{9.204 \times 10^{-23}} \text{ meters} \approx \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{9.204 \times 10^{-23}} \text{ meters} \approx 0.0216 \times 10^{-2} \text{ meters} \approx 2.16 \times 10^{-4} \text{ meters}, 
$$
which is $0.216\text{ mm}$, which is in the millimeter wave region (almost toward microwaves). 

Conversely, let us check the photon momentum required for a $v=0\to1$ transition:
$$
\Delta E = \hbar\omega = 4.216 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J}.
$$
$$
p = \frac{\Delta E}{c} = \frac{4.216 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \text{ kg}\cdot\text{m/s} = 1.405 \times 10^{-28} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
$$
However, since the question mentions "next state with the lowest possible energy" should be $0,0 \to 0,1$, thus the answer should be computed from the $2B$ energy difference transition.

Thus, the answer for the photon momentum should be:
$$
\boxed{3.068 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m/s}}.
$$
This value corresponds to the $0,0\to0,1$ transition energy.

However, double-checking the reasoning here might be important. Because $2B$ could be given in units of angular frequency:
-$B = \frac{\hbar}{2I}$ thus could be plugged directly.
Or alternatively, one should make sure $2B$ makes sense comparing directly:
We need to verify everything seems consistent here. 

#### Another Verification for Rotational Energy Difference Directly

The energy difference $\Delta E_{0,0\to0,1}$ should be:
$$
E_{0,1} - E_{0,0} = B\cdot 1 \cdot 2 - B \cdot 0 \cdot 1 = 2B,
$$
which makes sense thus far indeed $2B = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}$ where $B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}$, thus:
$$
2B = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
$$
Total energy term should be:
$$
E_{v,J} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega + B J (J+1).
$$
So now:
$$
B = \frac{\bbox[5px, border:2px solid blue]{\hbar^2}}{2I} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu R^2}.
$$
Calculating $B$ explicitly here:
$$
B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu R^2} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2} = \frac{1.11 \times 10^{-68}}{2.4144 \times 10^{-46}}.
$$
Results in:
$$
B \approx 4.599 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}.
$$
Thus, verified previously calculated $B$ was computed correctly previously.

Comparing to increase in $v$ from $0$ to $1$:
$$
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = 4.216 \times 10^{-20} \text{ J}.
$$
Thus, the answer seems consistent such that:
$$ 
2B < \hbar \omega;
$$
thus, the lowest energy transition is indeed to $J=1$ when $v=0$. 

So, the energy required should indeed be $2B$. The reasoning here seems sound such that:
$$
E_{\text{photon}} = \Delta E_{0,0\to0,1} = 2B = 9.198 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}.
$$
$$
\text{Photon momentum} = \frac{9.198 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}. \approx 3.066 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
$$
#### Verification check:
Another way to verify by recalling the photon energy formula $E_{\text{photon}} = h \nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$ and thus:
$$
p_{\text{ph}} = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{h \nu}{c} = \frac{E_f - E_i}{c}.
$$
So:
$$
p_{\text{ph}} = \frac{2B}{c} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I c}.
$$

Therefore, the answer is confirmed as such:
Strategy was:
1) Identify the next state after the ground state (which is $0,0 \to 0,1$).
2) Compute the energy difference (only rotational part contributes).
3) Use $p = \frac{\Delta E}{c}$ for the photon.

Therefore, verified several times, the key answer should indeed be:
$$
\boxed{3.068 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m/s}} \;\;\text{(rounding to three significant figures perhaps gets us a rounded value such as $\approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m/s}$
}
$$
Thus, double-checking the magnitude makes sense (rotational transitions are usually indeed in the microwave region thus lower energy photons which means lower photon momentum compared to infrared or visible light).
