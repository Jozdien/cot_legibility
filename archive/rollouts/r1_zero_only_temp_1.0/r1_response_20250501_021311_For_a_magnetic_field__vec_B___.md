# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

To solve for the paramagnetic coupling term and compare it to the transition energy of a hydrogen atom for a given wavelength, we need to recall two main concepts: the Zeeman effect (which includes the paramagnetic coupling term) and the energy of a photon emitted or absorbed in a hydrogen atom transition.

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term

The paramagnetic coupling term for an electron in a magnetic field \vec{B} parallel to the z-axis (i.e., \vec{B}=B \hat{z}) can be expressed as:

$$
\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = - \vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B} = - \mu_z B,
$$

where \vec{\mu} is the magnetic moment of the electron. The magnetic moment due to the orbital angular momentum (ignoring spin for now) \vec{L} is given by:

$$
\vec{\mu} = - \frac{\mu_B}{\hbar} \vec{L},
$$

where \mu_B is the Bohr magneton defined as:
$$
\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e},
$$
which has a value of approximately:
$$
\mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e} \approx 927.400 \times 10^{-26} \text{J/T}.
$$

The magnetic moment thus becomes:
$$
\vec{\mu} = - \frac{\mu_B}{\hbar} \vec{L} = -\left(\frac{e}{2m_e}\right) \vec{L}.
$$
Therefore, the z-component of the magnetic moment is:
$$
\mu_z = - \frac{\mu_B}{\hbar} L_z,
$$
where L_z is the z-component of the angular momentum \vec{L} given by:
$$
L_z = m\hbar,
$$
where m is the orbital magnetic quantum number (which takes values such that $ -l \leq m \leq l$, where $l$ is the orbital angular quantum number).

Hence:
$$
\mu_z = - \frac{\mu_B}{\hbar} \cdot m\hbar = - \mu_B m.
$$
The paramagnetic coupling term thus can be written as:
$$
\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = - \mu_z B = \mu_B m B.
$$
For "small values of m" (which likely means $m=1$), and $B=1 \text{T}$:
$$
\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = \mu_B \times m \times 1 = \mu_B m.
$$

### Transition Energy of the Hydrogen Atom

The transition energy corresponding to a photon with wavelength $\lambda=0.4861 \mu m$ can be calculated using the relation:
$$
\Delta E = h \nu = \frac{hc}{\lambda}.
$$
Here:
$$
h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s} \text{ (Planck's constant)}, \\
c \approx 3 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s} \text{ (speed of light)}, \\
\lambda = 0.4861 \mu m = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}.
$$
Inserting values:
$$
\Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^{8}}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}}.
$$
$$
\Delta E = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}}.
$$
$$
\Delta E \approx 4.089 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}.
$$
(Another common unit for energy in atomic physics is the electron-volt (eV), $1 \text{ eV} \approx 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$, so we can also convert this energy from joules to electron-volts if necessary:
$$
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.089 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \text{ eV}.
$$
However, for now, we'll keep working in joules for comparison.)

### Comparison of Order of Magnitude

We need to compare $\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}}$ for a magnetic field of $1 \text{ T}$ and $m=1$ with the given transition energy:
$$
\Delta E = 4.089 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}.
$$
The paramagnetic coupling term for $m=1$ and $B=1\text{ T}$ is:
$$
\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = \mu_B \times 1 \text{ (since } m=1 \text{ and } B=1\text{)},
$$
where:
$$
\mu_B = 927.400 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J/T} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \text{ J/T}.
$$
So again:
$$
\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \text{ J}.
$$

Let us compare the magnitudes:
$$
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24} \text{ J}}{4.089 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}.
$$

$$
\frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.089 \times 10^{-19}} \approx \frac{9.274}{4.089} \times 10^{-5} \approx 2.268 \times 10^{-5}.
$$
This implies that the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately $2.27 \times 10^{-5}$ times the given transition energy of the hydrogen atom.

Conversely, if we need the reverse ratio (which might make it easier to interpret):
$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}}} = \frac{4.089 \times 10^{-19}}{9.274 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 44089,
$$
which means that the given transition energy is on the order of $10^4$ to $10^5$ times larger than the paramagnetic coupling term.

Thus, the order of magnitude for the given transition energy is $10^-19$ J, whereas the order of magnitude for the paramagnetic coupling term for $B=1\text{ T}$ and $m=1$ is $10^{-24}$ J. The order of magnitudes for the two energies are thus:
$$
\Delta E \sim 10^{-19} \text{ J},
$$
$$
\Delta E_{\text{paramagnetic}} \sim 10^{-23} \text{ J}.
$$
Thus, the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is about $10,000$ (or $10^4$) times smaller than the given transition energy.

### Conclusion:
Considering the paramagnetic coupling term for $m=1$ and with a magnetic field of magnitude $1 \text{ T}$, the transition energy of a photon with a wavelength of $0.4861 \mu m$ is on the order of $10^4$ to $10^5$ times larger.
