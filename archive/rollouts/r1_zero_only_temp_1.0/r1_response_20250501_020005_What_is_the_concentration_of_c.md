To solve for the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stoichiometric $\text{Ca-EDTA}$ complex with a concentration of $0.02\,M$ and a stability constant $K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10}$ at an ideal pH (meaning that essentially all EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, typically designated as $Y^{4-}$), we need detailed information about the reaction between $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\text{EDTA}$ ($Y^{4-}$). 

The reaction can be formulated as:
$$
\text{Ca}^{2+} + Y^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaY}^{2-},
$$
where $Y^{4-}$ represents the fully deprotonated form of EDTA. The stability constant $K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}$ is defined as:
$$
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = 5 \times 10^{10}.
$$
However, it should be noted that $[\text{CaY}^{2-}]$ refers to the concentration of the complex formed from the reaction between $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $Y^{4-}$.

Given that the total concentration of the stoichiometric $\text{Ca-EDTA}$ complex is $0.02\,M}$, let us assume that initially, $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $Y^{4-}$ react completely to form $0.02\,M$ of $\text{CaY}^{2-}$ complex such that:
$$
[\text{CaY}^{2-}]_{\text{initial}} = 0.02\,M.
$$
However, what we need to find is what happens once this complex reaches equilibrium where there could be some dissociation back into $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $Y^{4-}$. 

However, another part of the question states that the complex is "stochiometric," which means that the initial amounts of $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $Y^{4-}$ should have been such that they react to exclusively form the complex until one of them is entirely used up. However, in reality, once formed, the $\text{CaY}^{2-}$ complex might still partially dissociate into $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $Y^{4-}$ until the reaction reaches equilibrium. 

Let us denote the initial concentration of $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and EDTA $(\text{Y}^{4-})$ before complexation as $0.02\,M$ for $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ reacting with an equal concentration of $0.02\,M$ of $Y^{4-}$ such that they react completely to form $\text{CaY}^{2-}$ complex until one of them is used up (which should be an equal reaction given stoichiometry is 1:1). However, here, the question states that the "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex" itself has a concentration of $0.02\,M$. 

To solve for the equilibrium concentrations upon reaching equilibrium, let us define $x$ as the concentration of $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ that dissociates from the $\text{CaY}^{2-}$ complex once equilibrium is reached. 

#### Setting up the equilibrium table:
Initially, before any dissociation:
$$
[\text{CaY}^{2-}]_{\text{initial}} = 0.02\,M,
\qquad [\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{\text{initial}} = 0\,M,
\qquad [Y^{4-}]_{\text{initial}} = 0\,M.
$$
At equilibrium, suppose $x$ moles per liter of the $\text{CaY}^{2-}$ dissociate into $x$ moles per liter of $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ and $x$ moles per liter of $Y^{4-}$:

$$
\text{Ca}^{2+} + Y^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaY}^{2-}.
$$
$$
\text{(Initial)} \qquad 0 \qquad 0 \qquad\qquad \ 0.02\,M,
$$
$$
\text{(Change)} \qquad +x \qquad +x \qquad \qquad -x,
$$
$$
\text{(Equilibrium)} \qquad x \qquad x \qquad \qquad 0.02 - x.
$$
So, the equilibrium concentrations expressed are:
$$
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x,
\qquad [Y^{4-}] = x,
\qquad [\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x.
$$
However, typically $x$ should be very small because the stability constant $K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}$ is quite large ($5 \times 10^{10}$), thus $0.02 - x \approx 0.02$, where $K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}$ is defined as:
$$
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][Y^{4-}]} = \frac{0.02 - x}{x \cdot x}.
$$
Plugging into the equilibrium constant expression:
$$
\frac{0.02 - x}{x^2} = 5 \times 10^{10}.
$$
Simplifying $0.02 - x \approx 0.02$ (since $x$ is assumed to be very small compared to $0.02$ due to the high stability constant $5 \times 10^{10}$):
$$
\frac{0.02}{x^2} \approx 5 \times 10^{10}.
$$

Solving for $x$:
$$
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13},
\\
x = \sqrt{\binom{4 \times 10^{-14}}{4 \times 10^{-13}}}\text{ (the right expression should be calculated accurately)}.
$$
Instead, let us solve that:
$$
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2} \times 10^{-10}}{5} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-12}}{5} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
$$
Hence:
$$
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
$$
To make that calculation error-free, note that:
$$
x \approx \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}}.
$$
However, it seems like we need to solve this part correctly.
First, check again:
$$
0.02 - x \neq 0.02 \text{ if } x \text{ is not negligibly small compared to }0.02.
$$
However, $0.4 \times 10^{-12}$ seems imprecisely calculated. Repeated calculations:
$x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}$.

So:
$$
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
$$
However, this seems like our previous result might need a bit of a recalculation and a clear verification. 

Consider:
$$
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02 - x}{x^2}.
$$
If $5 \times 10^{10} x^2 = 0.02 - x$:
$$5 \times 10^{10} x^2 + x - 0.02 = 0$$
Solve this quadratic equation for $x$ where $a = 5 \times 10^{10}$, $b = 1$, $c = -0.02$:
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
$$
Plug in $a$, $b$, and $c$:
$$
x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \times (5 \times 10^{10}) \times (-0.02)}}{2 \times 5 \times 10^{10}}.
$$
Calculate the discriminant:
$$
1 + 4 \times 5 \times 10^{10} \times 0.02 = 1 + 4 \times 5 \times 10^{10} \times 2 \times 10^{-2} = 1 + 4 \times 10^9.
$$
But $4 \times 10^9 \gg 1$, so:
$$
\sqrt{1 + 4 \times 10^9} \approx \sqrt{4 \times 10^9} \approx 2 \times \sqrt{10^9} \qquad \text{(actually, there's a mistake here, let us solve step-by-letter)}.
\sqrt{1 + 0.4 \times 19 \times 10^9} \text{ seems incorrect.}
$$
We need another organized round here:
$$
b = 1, \ a = 5 \times 10^{10}, \text{ so value of $b$ is negligible compared to $a$, } 4ac = 4 \times 5 \times 10^{10} \times 0.02 = (-0.02) \times 80 \times 10^{10}.
$$
This seems still a bit disorganized. More structured handling:

Do an algebraic solution by making back substitutions.

Since $K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}$ is very large, the reaction essentially goes nearly to completion until:
$$
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02\,M - \text{(small amount of $x$)}
$$
where $x$ is the amount remaining such that:
$$
\text{Ca}^{2+} + Y^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaY}^{2-},
\qquad K = 5 \times 10^{10}.
$$
This means that $[\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02\,M$. However, the question states "ideal pH" which ensures that EDTA essentially exists as $Y^{4-}$, so no protonated forms should be influential here. 

To find $x$, letting $u$ denote $[\text{Ca}^{2+}]$, we thus need $[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{Y}^{4-}]$ such that:
$$
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{u \cdot u} \text{ where } u = [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [Y^{4-}].
$$
Calling $u$ the unknown $[\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ concentration here makes:
$$
u^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}.
$$
Thus:
$$
u^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times ^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
$$
Hence:
$$
u = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \sim 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \text{ (To make it more standard expressions:)}.
$$
Let us calculate decimal accuracy:
$$
10^{-6.5} = 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.162 \times 10^{-7}.
$$
Thus,
$$
\sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 2 \times (3.162 \downarrow 10^{-7}) = 6.324 \times 10^{-7}. 
$$
Hence the concentration of $[\text{Ca}^{2+}]$ could be estimated here:
$$
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
$$
Double-check again:
$$
x = \approx (\frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}})^{\frac{1}{2}} = (\frac{20 \times 10^{-3}}{5 \times 10^{10}})^{\frac{1}{2}} = (4 \times 10^{-13})^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{4} \times 10^{-13/2} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
$$
This comes down to:
$$
2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7}.
$$
Another way to check if $0.02$, $0.02 - x \approx 0.02$ is a valid assumption:
$x \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7}$ which is indeed very small compared to $0.02$.

So, the concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately $6.32 \times 10^{-7}\,M$. 

However, a round-off to a reasonable number of significant figures given the question data requires making sure we round appropriately based on the initial given information:
Based on the input data of $0.02\,M$ (1 significant figure for $0.02$ which means "one significant digit") and $5\times10^{10}$ (where there is one significant digit for $5$):

However, $0.02$ has one significant figure so rounding our solution to one significant figure would make:
$$
6.32 \times 10^{-7} \text{ should round to } 6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ or more conventionally since $0.02$ has one significant figure as $5 \times 10^{-13}$}.
$$
What we need might be:
However typically and more conservatively, for $0.02$, there exist significant figures decided at two digits after decimals which makes round to $6.32 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}M$.

Thus, given the precision required, round the answer to significant digits based on the question's given figures where $0.02 \,M$ presumably has one significant figure $2 \times 10^{-2}$):
It makes sense to round $x$ result based on two candidates or "significant digits":

Conclusion:
$$
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] \cong 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ (M)}.
$$
Such rounding makes $6.3 \times 10^{-7}\,M$ a proper logical rounded answer.

However, let us round it correctly such that our answer fits significant figures individually for $0.02$ $(\text{which implies two significant figures after placing implicit decimal zeros})$ but $5 (\ln 5 \times 10^{10})$ has only one significant figure).

Howeverå£«let us don't round to gross figures and solve mathematically accurate:
$$
\sqrt{\frac{0.02}{5^*10^{10}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2*10^{-2}}{5*10^{10}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}*10^{-\frac{-2-10}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}*10^{-6} = \sqrt{0.4}*10^{-6} =\sqrt{0.4} \times 10^{-6} \simeq 0.6325 \times 10^{-6} = 6.325 \times 10^{-7}.
