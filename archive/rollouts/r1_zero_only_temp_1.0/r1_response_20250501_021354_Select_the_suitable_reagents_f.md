\boxed{
\text{A suitable reagent for the first reaction (\textit{butan-2-one} + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile) could be a source of protons like $H_2SO_4$ or $HCl$, which makes HCN in situ used together with NaCN.}\\
\text{A suitable reagent for the second reaction (2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid) could be a strong acid such as $HCl$ or $H_2SO_4$. Hence:\begin{itemize}
    \item "A" could be $H_2SO_4$ or $HCl$.
    \item "B" could be $HCl$ or $H_2SO_4$.
\end{itemize}
Since the question indicates that "B" works in the presence of H2O, a strong acid like $HCl$ seems most appropriate for hydrolyzing the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

To solve for the suitable reagents in the given reactions, let us reason through the specific reactions mentioned.

### Reaction 1:
butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile

The given reactant is butan-2-one (CH3CH2COCH3), and the target product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (likely stated as CH3CH2C(OH)(CH3)CN).

Let us first write the structure of butan-2-one:
$$
CH_3CH_2COCH_3,
$$
which has the following structure:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-C(=O)-CH_3}.
$$
The reaction with NaCN typically suggests a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN-) acts as a nucleophile. However, the reaction needs another reagent denoted here as "A." 

#### Reaction of ketone with NaCN usually follows a nucleophilic addition reaction where CN⁻ attacks the electrophilic carbon of the carbonyl group:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-C(=O)-CH_3} + CN^- \rightarrow \mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-C(-CN)(OH)-CH_3}
$$
However, the actual reaction usually requires an acidic environment such as H⁺ protons to activate the carbonyl group (making carbonyl carbon more electrophilic). However, a typical reaction might be:
$$
CH_3CH_2COCH_3 + HCN \rightarrow CH_3CH_2C(OH)(CN)CH_3,
$$
which produces a cyanohydrin where the cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl carbon and a hydroxy group forms on the same carbon. Another way to make such a reaction happen is by reacting a ketone with NaCN and a strong acid (which provides H⁺ ions so that CN⁻ from NaCN can react by producing HCN in situ). 

However, the reaction here mentions "NaCN + A" where "A" should likely be a source of protons such as an acid. However, a common reaction might directly mention HCN itself rather than mentioning NaCN separately plus another reagent "A." However, an acid can be understood here as a part of the overall reaction mechanism where H⁺ might facilitate the reaction. 

Let us check the product name "2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile." To verify the product structure (CH3CH2C(OH)(CH3)CN), we need to identify the longest carbon chain such that the nitrile group (CN) is at the 2nd position where a hydroxy group is also attached. The structure should be:
$$
\underset{\text{2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile}}{CH_3-CH_2-\underset{\overset{|}{OH}}C(CN)-CH_3}.
$$
This compound is formed by the addition of HCN to butan-2-one such that:
$$
CH_3CH_2 - C(=O) - CH_3 + HCN \rightarrow CH_3CH_2 - C(OH)(CN) - CH_3.
$$
Thus, "A" should be a source of protons such as a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4. However, the standard reaction for making a cyanohydrin usually involves using HCN directly or NaCN followed by acid workup (since NaCN does not readily react with ketones unless there is an acid present). 

To verify if using only NaCN and a strong acid is a valid way to make a cyanohydrin, another way to make cyanohydrins is indeed using NaCN and H+. However, a more common way mentioned in textbooks might explicitly state using HCN explicitly. Another valid way to make cyanohydrins is through the reaction of a ketone with NaCN and sulfuric acid (which makes HCN in situ). Based on this, "A" here could be most likely interpreted as a strong acid such as *H2SO4*, which facilitates the reaction between NaCN and butan-2-one.

#### Answer for Reaction 1:
Thus, reagent "A" should ideally be *HCl*, *H2SO4*, or another strong acid which helps in the formation of HCN from NaCN. However, what makes sense here is NaCN together with an acid that makes HCN in situ generally. However, a more common wording might be just "HCN"; however, "NaCN + HCl" makes HCN in situ which makes "A": "**H2SO4**" seems likely valid here.

### Reaction 2:
2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

The given reactant is "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile" (structure could be interpreted as follows: a phenyl group attached to a benzyl group at the para position, which forms a part of a compound where the main chain is a butane chain where the second carbon bears a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group (CN). 

The reactant structure seems to be:
$$
\mathrm{(Ph-CH_2-Ph)-C(\underset{\overset{|}{OH}}{CN})(CH_2CH_3)}
$$
where:
- Ph represents a phenyl group (C6H5),
- Ph-CH2-Ph means benzyl substituted phenyl group where benzyl (Ph-CH2) is attached at the fourth position of the first phenyl group (hence, 4-benzylphenyl means something like (C6H4-CH2-C6H5) where the benzyl group is attached to the fourth carbon of the first phenyl group which connects to the main chain at the 2-position of the compound "2-hydroxybutanenitrile" part).

However, a more structural description could be used as follows:
$$
[\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2-C_6H_4}]-\underset{\overset{|}{OH}}C(CN)-CH_2CH_3.
$$
The goal product is "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid." The main part of the compound now has a carboxylic acid instead of a nitrile:
$$
[\mathrm{C_6H_5CH_2-C_6H_4}]-\underset{\overset{|}{OH}}C(COOH)-CH_2CH_3.
$$
So, the reaction here converts a nitrile into a carboxylic acid. The transformation of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid typically requires acid hydrolysis where the nitrile group reacts with water to produce a carboxylic acid. 

This reaction usually requires a strong acid such as HCl:
$$
\mathrm{R-CN + 2H_2O + HCl \rightarrow R-COOH + NH_4Cl}
$$
However, another common reagent used for nitrile hydrolysis could be dilute HCl for acid hydrolysis or NaOH for base hydrolysis followed by acidification:
$$
\mathrm{R-CN} \overset{H_3O^+}{\longrightarrow} R-COOH.
$$

Based on this, the reaction with "B (H2O)" suggests another reagent "B" should be an acid such as HCl for acid hydrolysis of nitrile group:
```
2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + H_2O + H^+ \rightarrow 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.
```

Thus, reagent "B" here could be a strong acid such as *hydrochloric acid (HCl)* or *sulfuric acid (H2SO4)* which makes sense when it comes to hydrolyze a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid.

#### Answer for Reaction 2:
Thus, reagent "B" would thus be a strong acid such as *HCl* or *H2SO4*. Another valid reagent could be a base such as *NaOH* which upon acidification also leads to a carboxylic acid. However, the question mentions "B (H2O)" which makes us lean towards acid hydrolysis explicitly because it mentions B alongside H2O, thus B could indeed be a strong acid such as "HCl" or "H2SO4."

### Summary:
1. For the first reaction, the suitable reagent "A" is usually a strong acid such as $\mathbf{H_2SO_4}$.
2. For the second reaction, the suitable reagent "B" used alongside water is usually a strong acid such as $\mathbf{HCl}$.

However, a stronger reasoning makes us lean towards "acid" as the answer here. 

However, another valid route should be considered where the first step uses NaCN and H2SO4 to make a cyanohydrin (as HCN is generated in situ), while the second step uses another reagent "B" like H3O+ or HCl which assists in the hydrolysis of the nitrile to carboxylic acid.

Hence, the answer for the first reaction could be made specific:
1) “A” should be a strong acid such as $H_2SO_4$, $HCl$, or simply $H^+$ (acidic medium).
2) “B” should similarly be a strong acid such as $H_2SO_4$ or $HCl$. Otherwise, a base like $NaOH$ could be used followed by acidification.

However, a more explicit answer could be found if the question had specific keywords such as “acid hydrolysis” or “base hydrolysis” for the second reaction. However, the most common route for hydrolyzing nitriles to acids is:

$$2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile \xrightarrow{\text{H}_3\text{O}^+} 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.$$

Therefore, reagent B could be considered as:
A commonly used reagent for acid catalyzed hydrolysis is HCl or $H_{2}SO_{4}$.

However, the question itself seems to require a more precise answer which should validate common organic chemistry reactions such as:
1. HCN addition to a ketone (which can be carried out by NaCN and an acid such as H2SO4 or HCl which makes HCN in situ).
2. Hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid can be executed using a strong acid such as HCl or H2SO4 or NaOH followed by acidifying workup.

Thus, it makes sense that "A" could be $H_2SO_4$ (or HCl), while "B" could be an acid such as $H_2SO_4$ or $HCl$ as well.

However, the requirement might be a bit simplified here because both steps need an acidic environment. But for the bottom reaction, "B" should indeed be an acid such as "HCl" or "H2SO4."

However, a hint might be that in organic synthesis, "A" could be "H₂SO₄" for adding CN to butan-2-one to make cyanohydrin & "B" might likely be HCl or H₂SO₄ for the hydrolyzing reaction where nitrile turns into a carboxylic acid.
