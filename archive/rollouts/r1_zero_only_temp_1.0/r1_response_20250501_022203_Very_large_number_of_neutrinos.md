# Original Question

Very large number of neutrinos produced by the Sun reach the Earth (very large flux of neutrinos, defined as the number of neutrinos per cm^2, per second).

Let us assume that, hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were.

What would be the approximate ratio of the flux between two bands of neutrino energies of 700-800 KeV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). 

Flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) is:

(Note: we are talking about stopping the pp-III branch, not pp-II, pp-I or any other. Itâ€™s not a typo or something like that.)
(Note 2: solar neutrino flavor changes happen, but do not play a role here.)

To solve for the question about the effect of stopping the pp-III branch in the Sun on the flux of neutrinos in two different energy bands (700-800 keV versus 800-900 keV), we need to understand what the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain is.

The pp-III branch is one part of the p-p chain reactions that occur in the Sun's core where nuclear fusion produces energy through the conversion of hydrogen into helium. The main part of the pp chain reactions consists of three branches (pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III), although the pp-I chain is dominant (about 83% of helium fusion reactions in modern-day Sun follow through pp-I).

However, the primary reaction that initiates the pp chain is:
$$
^1\mathrm{H} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^2\mathrm{H} + e^+ + \nu_e,
$$
This reaction is called the pp reaction and produces a positron ($e^+$) and a neutrino ($\nu_e$) with energies ranging up to a maximum of about 0.42 MeV (420 keV).

However, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch. The complete proton-proton chain reaction includes the following branches:

#### pp I branch:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&1) \ ^1\mathrm{H} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^2\mathrm{H} + e^+ + \nu_e \ (\text{pp reaction}) \\
&2) \ e^+ + e^- \rightarrow 2\gamma \\
&3) \ ^2\mathrm{H} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^3\mathrm{He} + \gamma \\
&4) \ ^3\mathrm{He} + ^3\mathrm{He} \rightarrow ^4\mathrm{He} + 2^1\mathrm{H} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

#### pp II branch:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&1) \ ^1\mathrm{H} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^2\mathrm{H} + e^+ + \nu_e \ (\text{pp reaction}) \\
&2) \ e^+ + e^- \rightarrow 2\gamma \\
&3) \ ^2\mathrm{H} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^3\mathrm{He} + \gamma \\
&4) \ ^3\mathrm{He} + ^4\mathrm{He} \rightarrow ^7\mathrm{Be} + \gamma \\
&5) \ ^7\mathrm{Be} + e^- \rightarrow ^7\mathrm{Li} + \nu_e \\
&6) \ ^7\mathrm{Li} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow 2^4\mathrm{He} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
The neutrinos produced here mainly come from the first step (pp reaction) and the fifth step (electron capture on $^7\text{Be}$, yielding $^7\mathrm{Be} + e^- \rightarrow ^7\mathrm{Li} + \nu_e$). However, the $^7\text{Be}$ capture neutrinos have a single discrete energy of either 0.861 MeV (90% of the time) or 0.383 MeV (10% of the time).

#### pp III branch:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&1) \ ^1\mathrm{H} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^2\mathrm{H} + e^+ + \nu_e \ (\text{pp reaction}) \\
&2) \ e^+ + e^- \rightarrow 2\gamma \\
&3) \ ^2\mathrm{H} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^3\mathrm{He} + \gamma \\
&4) \ ^3\mathrm{He} + ^4\mathrm{He} \rightarrow ^7\mathrm{Be} + \gamma \\
&5) \ ^7\mathrm{Be} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^8\mathrm{B} + \gamma \\
&6) \ ^8\mathrm{B} \rightarrow ^8\mathrm{Be} + e^+ + \nu_e \\
&7) \ ^8\mathrm{Be} \rightarrow 2^4\mathrm{He} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
The neutrinos from the pp-III branch primarily come from the first step (pp reaction like in pp-I and pp-II) and another, higher energy neutrino resulting from the beta decay of $^8\mathrm{B}$:
$$^8\mathrm{B} \rightarrow ^8\mathrm{Be} + e^+ + \nu_e.$$
The $^8$B decay produces neutrinos that can reach energies up to approximately 15 MeV, with a peak around 6-8 MeV (though the maximum energy can be close to the Q-value of the decay, which is around 18 MeV, the average energy for $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos is higher and extends up to about 15 MeV).

Since the question states that the "pp-III branch suddenly stopped" about 8 minutes and half ago (which is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun to Earth and thus also implies that any neutrinos produced can reach Earth within that time frame), we need to figure out how that specifically affects neutrino fluxes in the energy bands 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2) on Earth.

If the pp-III branch is stopped, the only remaining neutrinos that need to be considered are those from pp-I and pp-II branches (since the pp-III branch does not directly produce any unique neutrinos except for the initial step which is shared among pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches until the $^3\mathrm{He}$ step where the reaction branches out).

However, the main question here is to find the flux ratio between the two given energy bands:
$$
\frac{\text{Flux (700-800 keV)}}{\text{Flux (800-900 keV)}}.
$$
To solve for what neutrinos are produced in the main pp branch reaction step:
$$
p + p \rightarrow ^2\mathrm{H} + e^+ + \nu_e,
$$
the generated neutrinos have a continuum spectrum with energies ranging mainly between 0 to around 420 keV (since experimentally determined the maximum neutrino energy from the pp reaction is about 0.42 MeV or 420 keV).

However, the question specifically mentions neutrinos which fall in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV energy bands:
1. The neutrinos from the pp reaction (which contributes neutrinos only up to 420 keV) thus do not contribute to either energy band mentioned.
    
2. Another major neutrino source is from the $^7\mathrm{Be}$ capture reaction for the pp-II branch:
$$^7\mathrm{Be} + e^- \rightarrow ^7\mathrm{Li} + \nu_e,$$
which yields neutrinos with two distinct energies: mainly approximately 90% of the neutrinos have an energy of around 0.861 MeV (861 keV), which lies in the 800-900 keV band band, while the other 10% come out at 0.383 MeV (383 keV), which does not contribute to either given band.

3. The $^8\mathrm{B}$ decay (from the pp-III branch) produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos with energies ranging up to roughly 15 MeV (with a significant fraction having energies well above 1 MeV).

Based on what we need to solve here, since the question mentions that the pp-III branch has been stopped "8 and a half minutes ago" (which is roughly the time it takes for neutrinos from the Sun to reach Earth), what matters here is what part of the pp-III branch affects energies in the given bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV).

The neutrinos from the pp-III branch from the $^8\mathrm{B}$ decay contribute to both given energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) because they span a broad spectrum that includes those energy bands. However, it seems that the question specifically mentions that the pp-III branch has been "stopped." Therefore, if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, we should no longer detect any neutrinos that were solely produced from the $^8\mathrm{B}$ beta decay. Any neutrino flux in the 700-800 keV band or the 800-900 keV band that was previously due to the $^8\mathrm{B}$ decay component must now be zero.

However, the $^7\mathrm{Be}$ capture reaction (which is part of both pp-II and pp-III branches) should still proceed until the $^7\mathrm{Be}$ captures an electron. However, once the pp-III branch is stopped, $^7\mathrm{Be}$ would either still be produced through the pp-II branch until it captures an electron (producing a neutrino most often at 861 keV which falls in the 800-900 keV band), or it could potentially accumulate instead of being used up in the step $^7\mathrm{Be} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^8\mathrm{B} + \gamma$ within the pp-III branch. However logically speaking, if only specifically the pp-III branch is stopped:

The net reaction for pp-II includes:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&^3\mathrm{He} + ^4\mathrm{He} \rightarrow ^7\mathrm{Be} + \gamma \\
&^7\mathrm{Be} + e^- \rightarrow ^7\mathrm{Li} + \nu_e,
\end{aligned}
$$
with the neutrino energy at 861 keV mainly falls within the 800-900 keV band (since 900 keV is 0.9 MeV, and 800 keV is 0.8 MeV, thus 861 keV would fit in the band from 800-900 keV and not in the 700-800 keV band).

However, once the pp-III branch is stopped, the $^7\mathrm{Be}$ that would have normally gone into forming $^7\mathrm{Be} + ^1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ^8\mathrm{B} + \gamma$ might now be more likely to follow another reaction such as:
$$
^7\mathrm{Be} + e^- \rightarrow ^7\mathrm{Li} + \nu_e,
$$
which then leads us to ask what fraction of $^7\mathrm{Be}$ originally followed pp-II versus pp-III pathways might still undergo electron capture.

So now, what we need is the relative fluxes previously originating from pp-III branch for the two energy bands mentioned:
The $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos have a broad spectrum and may contribute to both bands mentioned:
Flux (700-800 keV) could have received part of its contribution from the $^8\mathrm{B}$ beta decay spectrum which can span energies up to about 15 MeV. However, once the pp-III branch is stopped, no new $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos are generated.

Another part worth noting here seems to be what would be the only remaining significant source of neutrinos within the given energy bands if the pp-III branch is stopped. Given:
1. The pp reaction only produces neutrinos up to a maximum energy of 420 keV which thus does not contribute here.
2. The $^7\mathrm{Be}$ electron capture produces most neutrinos at 861 keV (with a smaller fraction at 382 keV).

Thus, the primary source of neutrinos in bands 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV would likely stem from:
1. $^7\mathrm{Be}$ capture neutrino flux should still contribute primarily neutrinos at 861 keV which fits in the 800-900 keV band but produces no significant neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band. Hence, stopping pp-III branch should still allow $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos at 861 keV if pp-II is still active.

But previously, any $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrino flux would contribute to both bands because of the broad energy spectrum of $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos where fluxes could be found in both the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. Thus, once the pp-III branch stops:
1. Any neutrinos in the 800-900 keV band should still receive a contribution from the $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos.
2. The neutrinos previously in the 800-900 keV band from $^8\mathrm{B}$ should be zeroed once pp-III branch stops.
3. Similarly, any neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band previously from $^8\mathrm{B}$ should also be zeroed.

Since the question hints that stopping pp-III should make a stark difference between the two bands, let us reason through what the question seems to be asking us to compare:
1. The $^7\mathrm{Be}$ decay which normally provides a neutrino primarily around 861 keV should still be present if only the pp-III branch has stopped while pp-II continues.
2. Thus, the "800-900 keV" band ("band 2") should mostly have only $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos within that energy range if no $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrino contribution is present.
3. The "700-800 keV" band ("band 1") should not have any significant neutrino contributions once pp-III is stopped because:
   - $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos only provide a line at 861 keV (thus only part of band 2).
   - pp neutrinos only go up to about 420 keV.

To solve for the flux ratios:
Since the only significant contribution within the 800-900 keV band should be $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos at 861 keV if the pp-III branch is stopped, whereas neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band should have been previously primarily from $^8\mathrm{B}$ decay neutrinos which do not continue once pp-III stops. 

So after stopping the pp-III branch, in the 700-800 keV band, the neutrino flux should be close to zero because there are no other known major solar neutrino sources contributing to that specific band apart from the $^8\mathrm{B}$ decay neutrinos which are now stopped. 

Conversely, the 800-900 keV band should still have a significant flux from the $^7\mathrm{Be}$ electron capture reaction. Therefore, it makes sense that after stopping the pp-III branch, the only significant flux would be in the 800-900 keV band (from $^7\mathrm{Be}$ decay).

This leads us to:
$$
\frac{\text{Flux (700-800 keV)}}{\text{Flux (800-900 keV)}} \approx \frac{\text{(virtually zero)}}{\text{(some non-zero flux from $^7\mathrm{Be}$ at 861 keV)}}.
$$
Hence, the ratio should be close to zero (which means the answer should be a very small number).

However, another valid point here is that the $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos do not typically contribute to the 700-800 keV band. However, we need a more refined reasoning here. 

However, it seems that perhaps $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos could contribute a little energy spread if there is some kinetic energy from thermal motion which broadens the line slightly, but the main line is still around 861 keV. Thus, what seems important here is:
1. The $^8\mathrm{B}$ decay neutrinos would normally contribute significantly throughout both given bands if pp-III was active. However, if pp-III is stopped, fluxes in both ranges should decrease significantly from whatever they originally were.
2. However, if the pp-II branch did not have another significant neutrino source apart from $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrons at roughly 861 keV (which fits mostly in the 800-900 keV band), the only major source for the 800-900 keV appears to be $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos formed in the pp-II branch after pp-III stops.

Considering the answer choices are:
(A) $\sim 0.5$
(B) $\sim 10^{-5}$
(C) Zero
(D) $\sim 1$
(E) Large, greater than one

Based on the reasoning, the "Flux (band 1) / Flux (band 2)" should be a very small number because:
1. The $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos (mainly in the 800-900 keV band) should still be produced if pp-II is still active.
2. The $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos at 861 keV might make a "significant" contribution for the 800-900 keV band only while almost no neutrinos should be left in the 700-800 keV band given that:
    - pp reaction only contributes up to 0.42 MeV = 420 keV.
    - No other major reactions should contribute to the bands mentioned apart from pp-III $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos which are now stopped.

So, it makes sense that the ratio should be:
$$
\frac{\text{Flux (band 1)}}{\text{Flux (band 2)}} \approx 0 \text{ or a very small number}
$$
However, "zero" might be a bit too absolute. But a very small fraction seems more realistic because:
We need to make sure that no other sources produce neutrinos in those bands -- if $^8\mathrm{B}$ decay is the only previously contributing process for the 700-800 keV range where neutrinos could be prominent here, it makes sense that the answer should be very close to something extremely small such as zero if the only contribution for band 2 was $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos.

However, we need to verify what other reaction produces neutrinos in the band 800-900 keV. The only other reaction that could produce such neutrinos would be $^7\mathrm{Be}$, which makes a contribution mainly at 861 keV. 

However, we need to make a more educated guess here based on provided choices. Given $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos have a broad energy distribution up to 15 MeV, the flux might be spread out such that:
1. The $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrino flux might be roughly comparable in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands when the pp-III branch is active. Hence, the ratio might be close to 1 when the pp-III branch is active.
2. However, $^8\mathrm{B}$ decays are typically much less frequent compared to the $^7\mathrm{Be}$ electron capture neutrinos because pp-III is a very minor part compared to pp-I and pp-II.

However, what should happen once pp-III stops?
1. If only $^7\mathrm{Be}$ neutrinos contribute specifically (mostly to band 2), the answer might be zero since the only remaining significant reaction yields a single peak mostly in the 800-900 keV band.

Ensuring that our reasoning is consistent with the provided choices, $^8\mathrm{B}$ neutrinos contribute only a tiny fraction of the total neutrino flux from the Sun (compared to the vast majority which comes from pp reactions which only produce neutrinos below 420 keV). Thus, the question should be answering what part of the solar neutrino flux comes from $^8\mathrm{B}$ decay neutrinos specifically in energy bands described.

Alternatively, it seems that $^8\mathrm{B}$ beta decay neutrinos make a minor overall flux compared to others such as pp reactions itself which make about 91% of total neutrino flux but all below 420 keV energy. 

However, due to the questionâ€™s inclusion of "8 and a half minutes ago," which is essentially the time needed for neutrinos to travel from the Sun to the Earth, what we need here is what effect stopping just the pp-III branch should have on the flux in those two specified energy bands. 

This makes us focus on what part compares flux in $^8\mathrm{B}$ neut
