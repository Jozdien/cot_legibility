To solve for the given reactions, let us analyze each part individually.

#### Reaction 1:
1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + (THF, KH, H+) ---> A

The compound "1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol" has a spiro[3.5]nonane backbone where one of the nonane rings has a double bond at the 5-position (hence, "-non-5-en") and a "-1-ol" group indicates that there is a hydroxyl group at the 1-position of the spiro compound. Additionally, there is a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) also attached to the spiro carbon at position 1. 

Based on the given compound name, here's a structural representation:
$$
\ce{ \underset{1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol}{\chemfig{[0](-[:45](-[:90]O_H)(-[2])=_1)-[1](-[:-30]-[::60](-[::60])=[::60]O)-[::30]?[a](-[::90]-[::30]-[::-30]?[a])-[::-30](-[::-90,.7]CH_2=CH_2)}}}
$$
However, a more standard drawing should make it easier to identify the main structural components such as the spiro junction connecting a cyclobutane (4-membered ring, part of spiro[3.5]nonane where "3" refers to a 4-membered ring including the spiro carbon) and a cyclohexene (six-membered ring with a double bond at the "5" position in the nonane part). Another part might be a bit confusing here so let's make a more systematic way to draw the compound.

The base name "spiro[3.5]nonane" refers to a structure where there are two fused rings (excluding the spiro carbon itself, there are a total of 9 carbon atoms in the two fused rings: 8 carbons in the rings + spiro carbon makes a spiro compound where smaller ring has 3 carbons excluding the spiro carbon (which makes it essentially a cyclobutane where the spiro carbon makes it part of a four-membered ring if you include the spiro carbon itself) and the larger ring has 5 carbons excluding the spiro carbon (which makes it a cyclohexane ring if you include the spiro carbon itself).

However, what seems a bit confusing here is the part "non-5-en-1-ol" which implies a double bond at the 5-position (which might indicate a double bond within the six-membered ring if we start enumerating from the spiro carbon as position 1). Moreover, "1-vinyl" indicates that a vinyl group is attached to the spiro carbon (carbon 1).

Hence another possible portion should be:
$$
\ce{ \stackrel{1}{\mathrm{C}} (CH_2=CH) }\text{(spiro carbon where one substituent is a vinyl(CH2=CH) group)}
$$
attached directly to the OH group should be on the same carbon where the spiro junction exists. 

We need to make a likely structural interpretation such that:
$$
\ce{(CH_2=CH)-C^1(- OH)(\text{(Spiro junction connects cyclobutane and cyclohexene where vinyl and hydroxyl are also attached to spiro carbon).}}
$$
The sequence mentions "THF, KH, H+". 

First, KH (potassium hydride) acts as a strong base which can deprotonate the alcohol group forming an alkoxide ion:
$$
\ce{(CH2=CH)-C^1(-OH) + KH -> (CH2=CH)-C^1(-O^(-)K^+) + H2}
$$
So, after KH treatment in THF, the compound should primarily be deprotonated to give us:
$$
\ce{(CH2=CH)-C^(-)(O^-K^+)}
$$
However, what happens next when H+ is added? After KH treatment, if an acid (H+) is added, the alkoxide anion can be protonated again back to the original alcohol group:
$$
\ce{(CH2=CH)-C^(-)(O^-K^+) + H+ -> (CH2=CH)-C^1(-OH)}
$$
However, this seems overly simplistic and should be verified if any other reaction might occur such as an intramolecular reaction facilitated by the alkoxide intermediate formed after deprotonation.

However, another possibility here is that the question might be suggesting some kind of "acid-catalyzed dehydration" reaction once the acid (H+) is added after the KH treatment (which initially acts as a base). Another relevant reaction could be a "rearrangement" reaction where a carbocation is formed and a double bond is involved (since there's a vinyl group).

Another part worth examining is if anionic or elimination reactions might take place where the alkoxide might act as a nucleophile or the vinyl group might be rearranged through an internal Michael addition type reaction whereby the alkoxide might attack an adjacent double bond.

Due to the complexity here, a typical reaction could be a rearrangement such as a semi-pinacol rearrangement where a carbocation is formed and a migration occurs. However, given that there seems to be a double bond involved here, a plausible reaction might be a Prins reaction where a vinyl group could undergo reactions with the formed alkoxide intermediate.

However, such a reaction might result in cyclization where alkoxide could react intramolecularly with the double bond in the five-carbon part of the spiro compound forming a cyclic ether or another product through a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement.

However, based on the question context ("1-vinyl"), the reaction should likely involve an oxy-Cope rearrangement where an allylic alcohol is deprotonated and rearranges such that:
Tes with KH, which deprotonates alcohol to give an alkoxide anion which might trigger an oxy-Cope rearrangement where the bond rearranges resulting in a new structure where the alkoxide moiety and vinyl group interact such that the double bond migrates:
$$
\ce{CH2=CH - C(-O^-)(\text{Spiro structure}) -> Rearranged Product}.
$$
However, for a more "classic" oxy-Cope rearrangement reaction, it involves a 1,5-hexadiene structure where there should be a double bond migrating such that:
$$
\ce{CH2=CH - CH2 - CH2 - CH=CH(OR^-) -> CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-(OR^-)}
$$
However, as our structure does not seem to follow a typical 1,5-hexadiene system directly linked to an alkoxide, we need another valid rearrangement.

Considering the reaction seems like "THF acts as a solvent and KH acts as a base yielding an alkoxide. However, the question mentions "H+" after KH which makes us question whether the reaction should be acid-catalyzed.

Based on the overall context, a plausible reaction here might be a "dehydration reaction" where after deprotonation, the addition of H+ might try to make a carbocation such that:
1) Deprotonate with KH.
2) After protonation up on addition of H+, eliminate water from the alcohol group to make a carbocation at the spiro carbon atom such that:
$$
\ce{(CH2=CH)-C^1(-OH) -[KH][H^+] (CH2=CH)-C^1 (+) -> Migration/rearrangement -> Final product}
$$
Another possible reaction might be a kind of "alkyne" formation or a "pinacol rearrangement" where a carbocation formed leads to a Wagner-Meerwein shift such that the spiro structure might rearrange.

However, a more reliable way to solve such a reaction is usually via a well-known acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction which should eliminate water (dehydration) from the alcohol group to make a carbocation which might rearrange.
$$
\ce{A compound such as: (CH2=CH)-C^1(-OH) ->[KH][THF,(H+)] A}
$$
Thus another possible major product would be a more stable alkene formed via dehydration.

#### Reaction 2:
(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol + acetyl bromide (Base = LDA) ---> B

The reactant here is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol which has the structure:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-OH}
$$
However, a more suitable way to write (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol might be emphasizing its more common structure:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-OH}.
$$
However, there seems to be a mistake in the structural representation previously mentioned which should be verified again. The given "CH3-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-OH" seems like a 5-carbon chain where the double bond is between the second and third carbon atoms ("2-en"), and the hydroxyl group is on the first carbon atom ("1-ol"). Thus an appropriate structure could verify:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-OH}.
$$
However,(E)-pent-2-en-1-ol should be:
$$
\ce{CH3CH=CH-CH2OH}
$$
It looks like there is an extra carbon in the first derived structure. Thus let us check the second reactant acetyl bromide (CH3COBr). In presence of a base like LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), LDA is a strong base that typically deprotonates α-carbon atoms.

To understand what reaction might occur here, LDA can deprotonate the α-hydrogen (which is adjacent to an electronegative group such as a carbonyl when reacting with acetyl bromide (CH3COBr). However, LDA could also deprotonate the most acidic proton in (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol. 

The most acidic proton in (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol might be:
1) The hydrogen on the carbon that is α to the double bond and the hydroxyl group (however, apart from hydroxyl group itself which contains an acidic OH proton, next would be the α-protons on CH2OH group which is the only such α-carbon here is next to the hydroxyl group (benzylic position is not an option here since it is not benzene derivative).
2) However, LDA might deprotonate the OH group forming an alkoxide ion of (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH=CH-CH2-OH + LDA -> CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O^-Li^+ + HN(iPr)2}.
$$

Acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) reacts typically through an acylation reaction where the acyl bromide acts as an acylating agent. When the alcohol is deprotonated:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O^- + CH3-CO-Br -> CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3 + Br^-}.
$$
So, the reaction product should be an ester:
$$
\ce{B = CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3}.
$$
However, there might be alternative pathways such as reactions at the α-carbon of the carbonyl in acetyl moiety.

Another possible reaction might be that LDA first deprotonates the hydroxyl group, and the remaining alkoxide might attack the carbonyl carbon (which seems a bit less likely here because acetyl bromide might get hydrolyzed as well). 

Hence:
$$
\ce{B = [Acetyl ester of (E)-Pent-2-en-1-ol] = CH3CH=CHCH2OCOCH3}.
$$

However, another viable pathway could be an SN2 reaction where the Lewis base (alkoxide anion) attacks acetyl bromide, where the bromine is a good leaving group such that:
$$
\ce{(CH3-CH=CH-CH2OH) + CH3-CO-Br -> CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-C(=O)-CH3}.
$$
So product B seems to logically be:
$$
\ce{B = CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-C(=O)-CH3}.
$$
However, to make sure the specific epimerization does not matter here, the structure remains:
$$
\mathrm{(E\text{-}} \text{pent-2-en-1-yl acetate)}.
$$

#### Conclusion:
Based on the above reasoning, the named reaction seems valid:

For reaction 1, A might likely be a rearranged product following dehydration (however, a more specific reaction mechanism might require a carefully drawn scheme and reaction conditions such as a Prins reaction might be involved).

However, for reaction 2, product B should be:
$$
\ce{CH3-CH=CH-CH2-O-C(=O)-CH3},
$$
which is the ester formed by reaction of "((E)-pent-2-en-1-ol) with acyl bromide (CH3COBr) in the presence of LDA.

However, for reaction 1, there might be a more well-known reaction such:
1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol might give rise to products such through rearrangement reactions such as an acid-catalyzed ring opening or another related reaction.

Another valid check here could be an oxy-Cope rearrangement where the 3,3-sigmatropic rearrangement might render a new compound. However verified this step-by-step reaction layout should thus be double-checked so that specific chemical mechanism is well verified via textbook verification or lab experiment from a reliable source.

Considering all the possibilities here, a suitable answer here seems:
1) A might be derived from a dehydration step where a carbocation is formed which undergoes a rearrangement process such as a Wagner-Meerwein shift.
2) B likely seems to be an ester formation such as:
$$
\ce{(E)-CH3-CH=CH-CH2OCOCH3}.
$$
However,—given such a detailed reasoning here, a more careful analysis might be required for reaction 1. However, reaction 2 seems a straightforward ester synthesis reaction.
