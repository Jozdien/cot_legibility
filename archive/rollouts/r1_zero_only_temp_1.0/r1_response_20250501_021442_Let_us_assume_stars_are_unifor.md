To solve for how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with the parallax itself given that stars are uniformly distributed in space, we need to recall that the parallax $p$ (often denoted as $\varpi$, but here we'll use $p$ for parallax) is defined as:

$$p = \frac{1}{d}$$
where $d$ is the distance to a star in parsecs if $p$ is given in arcseconds. 

Furthermore, if stars are uniformly distributed in space such that the spatial number density of stars (number of stars per unit volume) is constant (say $\rho$ stars per cubic parsec), we need to find out how the number of stars varies with respect to the parallax $p$.

The question asks for the "number of stars per unit range of parallax" as a function of $p$. Let us denote $N(p)$ as the total number of stars with parallaxes in the range $[0, p]$. To find the "distribution function" $f(p)$ which represents the number of stars per unit range of parallax such that:
$$f(p) = \frac{dN(p)}{dp},$$
we need to determine $N(p)$ first.

Since stars are assumed to be uniformly distributed in space, let us find how many stars are within a spherical shell of radius $d$ and thickness $dd$ centered on Earth (which is our observational point for parallax measurements):

The volume $dV$ of a spherical shell with inner radius $d$ and thickness $dd$ is:
$$dV = 4\pi d^2 dd.$$
Given the constant spatial stellar number density $\rho$ (number of stars per cubic parsec), the number of stars within this spherical shell is:
$$dN_{\text{shell}} = \rho \cdot dV = \rho \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd.$$

However, what we need is the distribution with respect to parallax $p$, where $p = \frac{1}{d}$ implies $d = \frac{1}{p}$. The next step is to make a variable substitution from $d$ to $p$. We need to express $dd$ in terms of $dp$:
$$d = \frac{1}{p} \implies \frac{dd}{dp} = \frac{d}{dp}\left (\frac{1}{p}\right) = -\frac{1}{p^2} \implies dd = -\frac{1}{p^2}dp,$$
where the negative sign indicates that if $d$ increases, $p$ decreases. However, for the positive part of our consideration here, we only need the absolute value of the thickness in terms of $dp$, so:
$$|dd| = \frac{1}{p^2} dp.$$

Therefore, the volume of the thin spherical shell can be expressed in terms of $p$ and $dp$ as:
$$dV = 4\pi d^2 |dd| = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.$$

Hence, the number of stars within a given range of parallax $dp$ around $p$ is:
$$dN_{\text{shell}} = \rho \cdot dV = \rho \cdot \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.$$
This implies that:
$$ \frac{dN_{\text{shell}}}{dp} = \rho \cdot \frac{4\pi}{p^4} = \frac{4\pi\rho}{p^4} \text{ (stars per unit range of parallax)}. $$
However, the distribution function $f(p)$ is defined as:
$$f(p) = \frac{dN(p)}{dp}.$$
So:
$$\frac{dN(p)}{dp} = \frac{4\pi\rho}{p^4}.$$
Therefore, the “number of stars per unit range of parallax” should be proportional to $\dfrac{1}{p^4}$ (or $p^{-4}$). 

This reasoning leads us to conclude that:
$$
\text{Number of stars per unit range of parallax} \propto p^{-4}.
$$

However, it seems that the question seeks us to verify that such a distribution follows a $p^{-4}$ relation. Thus verifying the proportional relationship makes us confident that:
$$f(p) = \frac{C}{p^4},$$
where $C$ is a constant which comprises the term $4\pi\rho$.

However, let us double-check our steps closely:
1) The volume element in spherical coordinates only accounts for the part of the "uniform distribution in space" understanding where:
$$
dV = 4\pi r^2 dr.
$$
2) To translate this into a "number of stars in a given parallax range":
$$
N(\text{from $p_1$ to $p_2$}) = \int_{p_2}^{p_1} \rho \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, \left|\frac{dd}{dp}\right| dp,
$$
where $\left|\frac{dd}{dp}\right| = \left|-\frac{1}{p^2}\right| = \frac{1}{p^2}$:
$$
= \int_{p_2}^{p_1} \rho \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) dp,
$$
$$
= \rho \cdot 4\pi \int_{p_2}^{p_1} p^{-4} dp.
$$

Hence, the part that represents "$f(p)$" (number of stars per unit parallax range) is:
$$
f(p) = 4 \pi \rho p^{-4}.
$$

Thus, the answer is that the number of stars per unit range of parallax varies as $(\text{plx})^{-4}$ or $p^{-4}$ where $p$ is the parallax. Another way to verify is by directly verifying units: if $\rho$ has units stars per cubic parsec ($\star/\text{pc}^3$), $4\pi$ is a dimensionless factor, $p$ has units of arcseconds, and $dN/dp$ should have units of stars per arcsecond (since $dN$ is the number of stars and $dp$ is parallax in arcseconds).

Thus, the essence here is:
$$\text{Differential stellar number distribution } \frac{dN}{dp} \text{, scales as } p^{-4}, \text{ for a uniform spatial distribution of stars.}$$
