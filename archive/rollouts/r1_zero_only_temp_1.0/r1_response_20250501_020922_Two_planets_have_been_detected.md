# Original Question

Two planets have been detected orbiting a star using both the transit and radial velocity (RV) methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?

To solve for the question of finding the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 (\(T_{eq1}\)) and Planet2 (\(T_{eq2}\)), we need to use the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet:

$$
T_{eq} = T_{\text{eff}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2 a}} (1 - A)^{1/4},
$$
where \( T_{\text{eff}}\) is the effective temperature of the star, \( R_{\star}\) is the radius of the star, \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit around the star, and \( A \) is the albedo of the planet.

The question itself mentions that both planets have the same albedo (\( A \)). Thus, for Planet1 and Planet2, the equilibrium temperature formula can be written separately:

$$
T_{eq1} = T_{\text{eff}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2a_1}} (1 - A)^{1/4},
$$

$$
T_{eq2} = T_{\text{eff}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2a_2}} (1 - A)^{1/4}.
$$
where \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) are the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively.

To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets, we need to divide the first equation by the second one:
$$
\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \frac{T_{\text{eff}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2a_1}} (1 - A)^{1/4}}{T_{\text{eff}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2 a_2}} (1 - A)^{1/4}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}.
$$
This makes us realize that the question now boils down to finding the semi-major axis values \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).

The question also states that the two planets are detected via both transit and radial velocity methods. However, what seems relevant here is that the question hints about "periodic shifts" in the forbidden line [Oi] at 6300 Å caused by the two planets. Such a "periodic shift"—specifically, a Doppler shift—can usually be used to estimate the star's radial velocity (RV) due to the gravitational tug of each planet. 

The formula for the Doppler shift is given by:
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{v}{c},
$$
where \( \Delta \lambda\) is the wavelength shift, \( \lambda\) is the rest wavelength of the line (which here is given as 6300 Å for the [Oi] line), and \( v\) is the radial velocity of the star relative to us (along the line of sight).

If \( \Delta \lambda \) is the observed wavelength shift due to the radial velocity effect caused by each planet, the question states that:
- For Planet1, the shift \( \Delta \lambda_1 \) is up to 0.03 Å for a line at \( \lambda = 6300 \) Å.
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\lambda} = \frac{v_1}{c} \Rightarrow \frac{0.03}{6300} = \frac{v_1}{c} \Rightarrow v_1 = \frac{0.03}{6300} c.
$$
- For Planet2, the shift \( \Delta \lambda_2 \) is up to 0.04 Å for the same line at \( \lambda = 6300 \) Å.
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda_2}{\lambda} = \frac{v_2}{c} \Rightarrow \frac{0.04}{6300} = \frac{v_2}{c} \Rightarrow v_2 = \frac{0.04}{6300} c,
$$
where \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes (velocity semi-amplitudes \(K_1\) and \(K_2\)) caused by Planet1 and Planet2 on the star, respectively.

Let us recall that the semi-amplitude \( K \) of the star's radial velocity caused by a single planet in a circular orbit is given by:
$$
K = \left(\frac{M_p \sin i}{M_{\star} + M_p}\right) \sqrt{\frac{GM_{\star}}{a}}.
$$
However, one common approximation for the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) when \(M_p \ll M_{\star}\) is formulated as follows:
$$
K \approx \sqrt{\frac{G}{M_{\star}}} \frac{M_p \sin i}{\sqrt{a}},
$$
where \( M_{\star} \) is the stellar mass, \(M_p\) is the planet mass, \(i\) is the orbital inclination (always \(\sin i\) because we only see the projection along the line of sight), and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. However, another more commonly used one is usually:
$$
K = \left(\frac{2\pi G}{T}\right)^{1/3} \frac{M_p \sin i}{(M_{\star} + M_p)^{2/3}}.
$$
However, a widely used form for the RV amplitude \(K\) is:
$$
K = \left(\frac{2 \pi G}{P}\right)^{1/3} \frac{M_p \sin i}{\sqrt{M_{\star}} \left(1 + \frac{M_p}{M_{\star}}\right)^{1/2} }.
$$
Typically, if \(M_p \ll M_{\star}\), we simplify this to:
$$
K \approx \left(\frac{2 \pi G}{P}\right)^{1/3} \frac{M_p \sin i}{\sqrt{M_{\star}}}.
$$

However, a more directly relevant form is:
$$
K = \left(\frac{G}{a\left(M_{\star} + M_p\right)}\right)^{1/2} M_p \sin i.
$$
where \( K \) is the semi-amplitude of the star's radial velocity, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, $ a $ is the semi-major axis, \( M_{\star}\) is the stellar mass, \( M_{p}\) is the planetary mass, and \( i\) is the orbital inclination. However, another more frequently used form is:
$$
K = \sqrt{\frac{G}{a(M_{\star} + M_p)}} M_p \sin i.
$$
Here, it seems like we need to solve separately for \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \), however, what matters here is finding their ratio \(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\) or \(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\). Given that both orbits are circular and the question already mentions that both planetary orbits are circular, it makes sense to find out the velocity amplitudes \( K_1\) and \( K_2 \).

Recall that:
$$
K_1 = \left(\frac{2\pi G}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}\frac{M_{p1}\sin i_1}{\left(M_{\star} + M_{p1}\right)^{2/3}},
$$
$$
K_2 = \left(\frac{2 \pi G}{P_2}\right)^{1/3} \frac{M_{p2} \sin i_2}{\left(M_{\star} + M_{p2}\right)^{2/3}}.
$$
However, a more common form can be used here where:
$$
K = (\frac{G}{a(M_{\star} + M_p)})^{1/2} \cdot M_p \sin i.
$$
However, for diffraction limited RV measurements for stars \(M_p << M_{\star}\), we can approximate:
$$
K \approx \sqrt{\frac{G}{M_{\star} a}} M_p \sin i,
$$
where \(K\) is the observed radial velocity amplitude which should be proportional to the observed wavelength shift. Based on previous calculations:
$$
v_1 = \frac{0.03 \, \text{\AA}}{6300 \, \text{\AA}} \cdot c,
$$
and:
$$
v_2 = \frac{0.04 \, \text{\AA}}{6300 \, \text{\AA}} \cdot c.
$$
Since:
$$
v_1 = K_1 = \sqrt{\frac{G}{a_1 M_{\star}}} M_{p1} \sin i_1,
$$
$$
v_2 = K_2 = \sqrt{\frac{G}{a_2 M_{\star}}} M_{p2} \sin i_2,
$$
we need another relation between \( a_1 \) and \( a_2\). 

To solve for the ratio of the velocity amplitudes provided:
$$
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = \frac{3}{4}.
$$
Also recall:
$$
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{G}{a_1 M_{\star}}} M_{p1} \sin i_1}{\sqrt{\frac{G}{a_2 M_{\star}}} M_{p2} \sin i_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \cdot \frac{M_{p1} \sin i_1}{M_{p2} \sin i_2}.
$$
Since the radial velocity method only gives line-of-sight velocity amplitudes which include the sine of inclination angle (\(\sin i\)), only the product \( M_p \sin i\) is directly measurable here unless we make assumptions regarding \(\sin i\). Thus, to make a more accurate handling here, substitute \(\sin i_1\) and \(\sin i_2\).

Because the planets are also discovered by transit, it means that they must transit the star such that the orbital inclination must be close to \(90^{\circ}\) (since transits only happen if the line of sight is almost parallel to the orbital plane, assuming \(i \approx 90^{\circ}\), hence \(\sin i_1 \approx \sin i_2 \approx \sin 90^\circ = 1\)). However, strictly speaking, the transit only implies that \(\sin i\) is close to 1 (since \(\cos i\) should be small compared to the star's radius divided by the semi-major axis, so \(i\) should be close to $90^\circ$). However, a more common transit condition is \(b < R_{\star}\), where:
$$
b = a \cos i,
$$
which implies that \(i\) must be sufficiently close to \(90^\circ\). Thus, using \(\sin i_1 \approx \sin i_2 \approx 1\) seems justified here:
$$
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \cdot \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}}.
$$
Since \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{3}{4}\),:
$$
\frac{3}{4} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \cdot \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}}.
$$
The question mentions that \(M_{p1} = 7 \times M_{\oplus}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 \times M_{\oplus}\), where \(M_{\oplus}\) is the Earth's mass \( (M_{\oplus} \approx 5.972 \times 10^{24} \;\text{kg})\).

Thus:
$$
\frac{3}{4} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \times \frac{7 \times M_{\oplus}}{5 \times M_{\oplus}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \times \frac{7}{5}.
$$
Solving for the semi-major axis ratio \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\):
$$
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{28}.
$$
Squaring both sides:
$$
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{15}{28}\right)^2 = \frac{225}{784}.
$$
However, what we need for the equilibrium temperature comparison is:
$$
\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}.
$$
Thus, all we need is the square root of the semi-major axis ratio:
$$
\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{225}{784}} =\frac{15}{28}.
$$
However, you need to check once again what \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\) was calculated above:
$$
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \color{red}{\frac{15}{28}}.
$$

However, an alternative interpretation should verify \(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\) again explicitly:
However, it makes sense to solve directly again for the semi-amplitude of radial velocity but through a common form for RV shift:

$$
K = (\frac{2\pi G}{T})^{1/3} \frac{M_P \sin i}{(M_{\star} + M_P)^{2/3}}.
$$
However, for a more general form (if \(M_p \ll M_{\star}\)):
$$
K = \left(\frac{G}{M_{\star}}\right) ^{1/2} \frac{M_P \sin i}{\sqrt{a}}.
$$
So:
$$
K_1 = \left(\frac{G}{M_{\star}}\right) ^{1/2} \frac{M_{P1} \sin i_1}{\sqrt{a_1}}.
$$
$$
K_2 = \left(\frac{G}{M_{\star}}\right) ^{1/2} \frac{M_{P2} \sin i_2}{\sqrt{a_2}}.
$$
Since:
$$
K_1 = K_{\star,1} = \frac{0.03}{6300} c,
$$
$$
K_2 = K_{\star,2} = \frac{0.04}{6300} c,
$$
Thus,
$$
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{\frac{0.03}{6300} c}{\frac{0.04}{6300} c} = \frac{K_{\star,1}}{K_{\star,2}} = \frac{3}{4}.
$$
Also,
$$
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \cdot \frac{M_{p1}\sin i_1}{M_{p2}\sin i_2}.
$$
If \(\sin i_1 \approx \sin i_2\):
$$
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \cdot \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}}.
$$
Substituting the given masses,
$$
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \dfrac{3}{4} = \sqrt{\frac{.a_2}{a_1}} \cdot \frac{7 M_{\oplus}}{5 M_{\oplus}}.
$$
$$
\dfrac{3}{4} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \cdot \frac{7}{5}.
$$
$$
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{28}.
$$

However, we need to verify if the formula for the equilibrium temperature itself was interpreted correctly. From the derivation:
$$
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\star} \, \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2a}} \cdot (1 - A)^{1/4}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2 a_1}} \, (1 - A_1)^{1/4} \div \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2 a_2}} (1 - A_2)^{1/4} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\left(\frac{1 - A_1}{1 - A_2}\right)^{1/4}.
$$
Since both planetary albedos \( A_1 \) and \( A_2 \) are given as equal (\(A\)):
$$
\left(\frac{1 - A_1}{1 - A_2}\right)^{1/4} = 1,
$$
so:
$$
\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}.
$$
We already found:
$$
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{15}{28}.
$$
However, the relation \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\) appears correctly used here.

Thus, the final ratio should be:
$$
\boxed{\frac{15}{28}}.
$$

If we round the fraction to a decimal:
$$
\frac{15}{28} \approx 0.5357.
$$

However, one might want to verify everything once more thoroughly. So, another way might be:
$$
T_{eq} \approx T_{\text{eff}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2a}} \equiv T_\text{eff} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}/2}{a}}.
$$
Thus another way to make sure that the solution follows:
$$
\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}.
$$
where we previously solved:
$$
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{15}{28}.
$$
So that appears to be the final answer so far. 

So, the question now is whether the orbit orientation angles are indeed similar such that assuming \(\sin i_1 \approx \sin i_2 \approx 1\) is justified. However, given that the problem assumes that such planets were detected via both transit and radial velocity techniques, it makes sense that \(\sin i \approx 1\) should be a valid assumption here.
