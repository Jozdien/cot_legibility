# Original Question

An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. A spontaneous fission occurs in which it splits into two fragments (and nothing else), such that one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other (in terms of their rest-masses). The sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. 

Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What is the difference between the (correct) T1 value, and T1 value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation?

(Ignore the electrons.)

To solve for the given question regarding the fission of an atomic nucleus of mass $M$ (with a rest-mass energy of $300$ GeV), we need to analyze the given problem step by step.

#### Initial Setup:
1. The rest-mass energy of the original nucleus is given as $Mc^2 = 300$ GeV where $M$ is the rest mass of the nucleus and $c$ is the speed of light.
2. The nucleus spontaneously fissions into two fragments such that the heavier fragment has a rest mass $m_1$ which is twice the rest mass of the lighter fragment $m_2$:
$$
m_1 = 2m_2.
$$
3. It is also given that the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is $99\%$ of the initial rest mass $M$:
$$
m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M.
$$
    
#### Goal:
To find the kinetic energy $T_1$ of the more massive fragment $m_1$, let us first solve for $m_1$ and $m_2$ in terms of $M$. From the second condition:
$$
m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M.
$$
However, we recall $m_1 = 2m_2$, which means:
$$
m_1 = \frac{2}{3}(m_1 + m_2) \text{ (since $m_1 = 2m_2$, $m_1 + m_2 = \frac{3}{2}m_1$)}.
$$
Thus:
$$
m_1 = \frac{2}{3} \times 0.99M = \frac{2 \times 0.99M}{3} = \frac{1.98M}{3} = 0.66M,
$$
$$
m_2 = \frac{m_1}{2} = 0.33M.
$$
We need to verify by directly solving for $m_1$ and $m_2$ again:
$$
m_1 = 2m_2, \qquad m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M.
$$
So substitute $m_1 = 2m_2$ into the second equation:
$$
2m_2 + m_2 = 0.99M,
$$
$$
3m_2 = 0.99M,
$$
$$
m_2 = 0.33M,
$$
$$
m_1 = 2 \times 0.33M = 0.66M.
$$

#### Rest-mass Energies of the Fragments:
The rest-mass energies for the two fragments are given by:
$$
m_1c^2 = 0.66Mc^2,
$$
$$
m_2c^2 = 0.33Mc^2.
$$
Since $Mc^2 = 300$ GeV:
$$
m_1c^2 = 0.66 \times 300 \text{ GeV} = 198 \text{ GeV},
$$
$$
m_2c^2 = 0.33 \times 300 \text{ GeV} = 99 \text{ GeV}.
$$
To double-check:
$$
m_1 + m_2 = 0.66M + 0.33M = 0.99M.
$$
Thus, the total rest mass after fission is $0.99M$, which means there is a mass defect of $0.01M$.

#### Mass Defect and Energy Release:
The "missing" mass of $0.01M$ is converted into kinetic energy of the two fragments. Since the total momentum of the system must be conserved, and the initial nucleus was at rest:
$$
\vec{P}_{\text{initial}} = 0,
$$
so the total momentum after fission should also be zero:
$$
\vec{p}_1 + \vec{p}_2 = 0,
$$
which yields:
$$
\vec{p}_1 = -\vec{p}_2.
$$
Therefore, the momenta of the two fragments are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

#### Applying Energy Conservation:

The total energy before fission is:
$$
E_{\text{initial}} = Mc^2,
$$
because the nucleus is initially at rest. The total energy after fission should be equal to the initial energy (since total energy is conserved):
$$
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2,
$$
where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the total energies of the fragments $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively. The total energy of a particle is defined as:
$$
E = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}.
$$
Using this for $m_1$ and $m_2$ where $|\vec{p}_1| = |\vec{p}_2| = p$:
$$
E_1 = \sqrt{(p_1c)^2 + (m_1c^2)^2} = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + (m_1c^2)^2},
$$
$$
E_2 = \sqrt{(p_2c)^2 + (m_2c^2)^2} = \Ïã\sqrt{p^2c^2 + (m_2c^2)^2}.
$$
Since total energy is conserved:
$$
300 \text{ GeV} = Mc^2 = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + (m_1c^2)^2} + \sqrt{p^2c^2 + (m_2c^2)^2}.
$$
Let us substitute known values:
$$
300\text{ GeV} = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + (198)^2} + \sqrt{p^2c^2 + (99)^2},
$$
where here and subsequently "$198$" means $198$ GeV and "$99$" means $99$ GeV (as $m_1c^2 = 198\text{ GeV}$ and $m_2c^2 = 99\text{ GeV}$).

#### Solve for $p$:

$$
\mbox{300GeV} = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + (198\text{ GeV})^2} + \sqrt{p^2c^2 + (99\text{ GeV})^2}.
$$
Let $x = pc$, so:
$$
300 = \sqrt{x^2 + 198^2} + \sqrt{x^2 + 99^2}.
$$
Let us solve for $x$ explicitly:
$$
300 - \sqrt{x^2 + 198^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 99^2},
$$
Square both sides:
$$
(300 - \sqrt{x^2 + 198^2})^2 = x^2 + 99^2,
$$
$$
300^2 - 600\sqrt{x^2 + 198^2} + (x^2 + 198^2) = x^2 + 99^2,
$$
$$
300^2 + x^2 + 198^2 - 600\sqrt{x^2 + 198^2} = x^2 + 99^2,
$$
$$
300^2 + 198^2 - 99^2 = 600\sqrt{x^2 + 198^2}.
$$
Note that:
$$
300^2 + 198^2 - 99^2 = 90000 + 39204 - 9801 = 119403,
$$
so:
$$
119403 = 600\sqrt{x^2 + 198^2},
$$
$$
\sqrt{x^2 + 198^2} = \frac{119403}{600} \approx 199.005,
$$
$$
x^2 + 198^2 = (199.005)^2,
$$
$$
x^2 + 39204 = 39602.990025,
$$
$$
x^2 = 39602.990025 - 39204 = 398.990025,
$$
$$
x = \sqrt{398.990025} \approx 19.9747,
$$
$$
pc \approx 19.9747 \text{ GeV}.
$$
Thus:
$$
p \approx \frac{19.9747 \text{ GeV}}{c}.
$$

#### Kinetic Energies of $m_1$ and $m_2$:
The kinetic energy $T$ of a particle is given by:
$$
T = E - E_0 = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2} - mc^2.
$$
For particle $m_1$:
$$
T_1 = E_1 - m_1c^2,
$$
$$
T_1 = \sqrt{p^2c^2 + (m_1c^2)^2} - m_1c^2,
$$
$$
T_1 = \sqrt{x^2 + 198^2} - 198.
$$
We previously computed:
$$
\sqrt{x^2 + 198^2} = 199.005,
$$
so:
$$
T_1 = 199.005 \text{ GeV} - 198\text{ GeV} \approx 199.005 - 198 = 1.005\text{ GeV}.
$$

Similarly, for particle $m_2$:
$$
T_2 = E_2 - m_2c^2,
$$
$$
T_2 = \sqrt{x^2 + 99^2} - 99,
$$
We need to separately calculate $\sqrt{x^2 + 99^2}$:
$$
x \approx 19.9747,
$$
so:
$$
\sqrt{x^2 + 99^2} \approx \sqrt{(19.9747)^2 + 99^2} = \sqrt{398.98 + 9801} \approx 101.005,
$$
Thus:
$$
T_2 = 101.005\text{ GeV} - 99 \text{ GeV} \approx 101.005 - 99 = 2.005\text{ GeV}.
$$
Note that total kinetic energy should be the mass defect converted into kinetic energy:
$$
T_1 + T_2 = 1.005\text{ GeV} + 2.005\text{ GeV} = 3.01\text{ GeV}.
$$

This total kinetic energy should also be equal to the difference between the initial rest mass energy and the total rest mass energy of the fragments after fission:
$$
0.01Mc^2.
$$
Since $Mc^2 = 300$ GeV:
$$
0.01 \times 300 \text{ GeV} = 3\text{.}0\text{ GeV}.
$$
The discrepancy here (3.01 GeV vs 3.0 GeV) is primarily due to rounding errors in calculations such as $199.005 \approx 199.005$ instead of a cleaner round number which seems like $199\text{ GeV}$. However, rounding might need more digits preserved until the final round:
$$
\sqrt{x^2 + 198^2} \approx \sqrt{398.990025 + 198^2} \approx 199.0049937 \text{ GeV},
$$
$$
T_1 + T_2 = (199.0049937 - 198) + (101.0049937 - 99) \approx 1.0049937 + 2.0049937 \approx 3.0099874,
$$
which is close enough to the expected $3\text{ GeV}$.

#### Classical (Non-Relativistic) Approximation:

To find what $T_1$ would be classically, we need to equate momentum where $|\vec{p}_1| = |\vec{p}_2|$, so:
$$
m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \implies \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1} = \frac{m_2}{2m_2} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$
$$
v_2 = 2v_1.
$$
The total kinetic energy obtained from the rest-mass discrepancy should be:
$$
0.01Mc^2 = (0.01 \times 300) \text{ GeV} = 3\text{ GeV}.
$$
Classically, the total kinetic energy is:
$$
T_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2.
$$
Utilize $m_2 = \frac{m_1}{2}$ and $s = \frac{v_1}{v_2}$:
$$
T_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{m_1}{2}\right) v_2^2.
$$
Recall $v_2 = 2v_1$:
$$
T_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{m_1}{2}\right) (2v_1)^2.
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{m_1}{4} \times 4v_1^2.
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + m_1 v_1^2.
$$
$$
= \frac{3}{2} m_1 v_1^2.
$$
This must equal $3\text{ GeV}$:
$$
\frac{3}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = 3\text{ GeV}.
$$
$$
m_1 v_1^2 = 2\text{ GeV}.
$$
However, what we need to find is the amount of kinetic energy assigned to $m_1$ specifically (which is $T_1$ in classical terms).
$$
T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2.
$$
We already know:
$$
\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = 3 \text{ GeV},
$$
where now we need to solve explicitly for $T_1$:
$$
T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2.
$$

#### Another way to express the total kinetic energy explicitly:
$$
T_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2.
$$
Since total kinetic energy is $3\text{ GeV}$:
$$
\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = 3.
$$
Recall $m_1 = 0.66M$ and $m_2 = 0.33M$ where $M = \frac{300 \text{ GeV}}{c^2}$:
$$
m_1 = 0.66 \cdot \frac{300 \text{ GeV}}{c^2} \text{ and } m_2 = 0.33 \cdot \frac{300 \text{ GeV}}{c^2}.
$$
$$
m_1 = 0.66 \cdot \frac{300}{c^2} \text{ kg} \text{ (keeping the unit GeV/c}^2\text{)},
$$
$$
\overline{m_1} = 198 \cdot \frac{\text{GeV}}{c^2}.
$$
$$
m_2 = 0.33 \cdot \frac{300}{c^2} \text{ kg} \text{ GeV/$c^2$},
$$
$$
\overline{m_2} = 99 \cdot\frac{\text{GeV}}{c^2}.
$$
From momentum conservation $m_1 v_1 = -m_2 v_2$:
$$
m_1 v_1 = -m_2 v_2,
$$
$$
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1} = \frac{99}{198} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$
Classical kinetic energies:
$$
T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2.
$$
$$
T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2.
$$
$$
T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 (2v_1)^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_2\cdot 4 v_1^2 = 2 m_2 v_1^2.
$$
Using $v_1 = \frac{v_2}{2}$:
$$
T_1 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (0.66M) v_1^2.
$$
$$
T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 (v_2)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (0.33M) v_2^2.
$$
Using $m_1 = 2m_2$ gives:
$$
T_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2m_2 \left(\frac{v_2}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} m_2 v_2^2.
$$
While $T_2$ is:
$$
T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2.
$$
This shows that $T_2 = 2T_1$:
$$
T_{\text{total}} = T_1 + T_2 = 3T_1.
$$
$$
T_1 = \frac{T_{\text{total}}}{3} =\frac{300 \times 0.01}{3} = \frac{3 \text{ GeV}}{3} = 1\text{ GeV}.
$$
So $T_2 = 2\text{ GeV}$ is consistent with:
$$
T_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2,
$$
while $T_2 = 2T_1$ makes sure that the total kinetic energy is:
$$
T_1 + 2T_1 = 3\text{ GeV}.
$$

#### Comparison of Relativistic vs. Classical Results for $T_1$:

The question asks us what is the difference between the "correct" (i.e., relativistic) value of $T_1$ and what $T_1$ would be if calculated classically. 

From the relativistic calculation:
$$
T_1 \approx 1.005 \text{ GeV}.
$$
From the classical calculation:
$$
T_1 = 1\text{ GeV}.
$$

The difference between the "correct" relativistic $T_1$ and the classically approximated $T_1$ is thus:
$$
1.005 \text{ GeV} - 1 \text{ GeV} = 0.005 \text{ GeV} = 5 \text{ MeV}.
$$

However, it makes sense to double-check if there's a good round-figure answer:
You could round $T_1$ accurately as:
$$
T_1 \text{(relativity)} \approx 1.0049937 \text{ GeV} \text{ (round accurately)}.
$$
$$
T_1 \text{(classical)}
