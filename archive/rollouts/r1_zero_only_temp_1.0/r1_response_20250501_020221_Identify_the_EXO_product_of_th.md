To solve for the product of the given [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione (also known as maleic anhydride), let us recall what a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction (also known as a Diels-Alder reaction) involves.

The [4+2] cycloaddition reaction is a concerted reaction where a diene (a molecule with a pair of alternating double bonds, making up a total of 4 π-electrons) reacts with a dienophile (a molecule with a double bond, making up a total of 2 π-electrons) to form a six-membered ring. However, what must be noted here is that the diene should be in the "s-cis" conformation where the double bonds are on the same side of a single bond.

Let us first write down the structures for the reactants:
1. **2,5-dimethylthiophene**:
    
    The molecule has a thiophene ring (a five-membered ring containing one sulfur atom and two double bonds). The structure of thiophene itself is:
    
    ```
            S
        /       \
    HC====CH    HC===CH
        ||        ||
        CH        CH
    ```
    
    For 2,5-dimethylthiophene, there are methyl substituents at the 2nd and 5th carbon atoms (which are the carbons directly adjacent to the sulfur atom). The numbering on a thiophene ring typically starts from the sulfur atom at position 1 and proceeds clockwise or counterclockwise such that the carbon atoms are numbered 2, 3, 4, and 5:
    
    ```
             S (1)
        /           \
    CH3C====CH     CH===CCH3
        || (2)        (5) ||
        (3) CH        CH (4)
    ```

2. **Furan-2,5-dione (maleic anhydride)**:

    Furan-2,5-dione is another name for maleic anhydride which has the structure:
    
    ```
          O
          ||
         / \
        ||   \
        C-------O
       /        \
      C          C
       \        /
       O       O
    ```
    
    However, what matters most for the Diels-Alder reaction is the part with the double bond within the maleic anhydride (which serves as the dienophile component). Another way to represent it might be:
    
    ```
        O     
        ||
       / \     
      /   \    
    O      C
            \\       - double bond here acts as the dienophile part
             C
             /
            C  
            \\
            (O is part of the anhydride group)
    ```

Given this, a Diels-Alder reaction typically requires:
- A diene part that needs to be in the s-cis conformation where there are two double bonds separated by one single bond (which allows for "4 π-electrons").
    
However, the question here is whether 2,5-dimethylthiophene is capable of acting as a diene component in a Diels-Alder reaction. 

Considering the aromatic nature of thiophene (which consists of a five-membered ring with six π-electrons distributed over five atoms, thus making it an aromatic compound), thiophene generally does not readily act as a diene in Diels-Alder reactions unless there is a particularly reactive dienophile like maleic anhydride. However, for it to act as a diene, one double bond should open up such that there is a "s-cis" diene part (alternating double-single-double bonds). 

However, another common fact is that aromatic compounds such as benzene (which has a fully conjugated six π-electron system) are generally very stable and thus do not typically participate in Diels-Alder reactions. Although thiophene is indeed aromatic (with six π-electrons distributed over five atoms where five atoms share these six π-electrons), it should be noted that it is a bit less aromatic than benzene because of the lower electronegativity of sulfur compared to carbon atoms. Yet, it is still stable due to its aromaticity.

Nevertheless, under normal conditions, thiophene might need a very reactive dienophile such as maleic anhydride or benzyne for a Diels-Alder reaction. However, when substituted thiophene is involved, such as in our case where 2,5-dimethylthiophene is used, aromaticity will be disrupted if a Diels-Alder reaction occurs. 

However, there is a well-known reaction called the “Diels-Alder reaction” where thiophene can participate as a diene when reacted with highly electrophilic dienophiles such as maleic anhydride and benzyne. After this reaction, an intermediate might lose SO2 (sulfur dioxide) to give a benzene derivative if the product formed still contains a sulfur atom in a non-aromatic environment. 

Let us analyze what happens:
1) The "endocis" conformation should be such that the two methyl groups from the 2,5-dimethylthiophene give us a "bridgehead" structure upon reaction with maleic anhydride where the sulfur remains part of a bicyclic structure temporarily. 

2) The [4+2] cycloaddition should thus yield a bicyclic compound consisting of a six-membered ring (product of cycloaddition) fused to a five-membered ring (remaining part of thiophene ring minus one double bond used in the reaction).

3) Another important factor here is the "exo" versus "endo" isomerism in the Diels-Alder reaction. The "endo" product (which favors secondary orbital interactions) might be the major product if steric interactions are not a significant issue. Nevertheless, the question specifies that we need to identify the "EXO" product.

Let us break down the given reaction explicitly step-by-step:

[4+2] cycloaddition reaction could mean:
- 2,5-dimethylthiophene acts as a diene where one double bond reacts with maleic anhydride (acting as a dienophile).

Since the question asks for the EXO product, it means we need to make sure that any bulky groups such as the anhydride part should be pointed “away” from the thiophene ring structure itself.

The main part of the question thus is describing a Diels-Alder reaction where reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and maleic anhydride (furan-2,5-dione). The dielophile should align such that the carbonyl part points away from the diene part if we need an exo product where substituents are oriented such that they are on the opposite sides of the newly formed bicyclic compound.

The major product can be represented as follows (for a possible reaction mechanism where the maleic anhydride reacts primarily at the double bonds of the thiophene):

1) Assuming that maleic anhydride acts as a dienophile on the C2-C3 and C4-C5 double bonds of the thiophene (while still retaining the sulfur atom in the resulting bicyclic structure):
    
    The product should be a bicyclic compound where the sulfur atom retains its part in a six-membered cyclohexene ring fused with the [remaining part of the thiophene structure]. However, the question specifically asks for the "EXO" product specifically mentioned here:
    
    The reaction could be:
$$
\underset{2,5-dimethylthiophene}{\begin{array}{c}
\text{ }\ce{C6H8S}\\
\ce{(CH3)C4H2S(CH3)}
\end{array}} + \underset{Maleic anhydride}{\ce{C4H2O3}} \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} \text{Product}
$$
    
2) Another possible issue before drawing the product explicitly is whether the reaction actually makes sense chemically here. One well-known reaction between benzene derivatives and maleic anhydride is the Diels-Alder reaction itself where benzene does not react easily unless harsh conditions are applied. However, another well-known reaction for thiophenes is the reaction with maleic anhydride where the reaction actually takes place as follows:

First, the reaction between thiophene itself (instead of 2,5-dimethylthiophene) and maleic anhydride yields a [4+2] cycloadduct where the bicyclic adduct is formed which then undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction where sulfur dioxide is released yielding a benzene derivative. Thus:
$$
\ce{S-C4H4 + CH(CO)2O ->[2,5-dimethylthiophene + maleic anhydride] Bicyclic adduct ->[\Delta] C6H4(CO)2O + SO2}
$$
However, another part might be a bit complex here because the expulsion of SO2 based on the retro-chelotropic reaction could occur if the bicyclic adduct is not stable.

However, due to the lack of a double bond in maleic anhydride reacting perfectly with 2,5-dimethylthiophene, it sounds like:
1) The major product might be such where:
$$
2,5-\text{dimethylthiophene} + \text{Furan-2,5-dione} \text{(Maleic anhydride)} \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} \text{Bicyclic sulfoxide structure initially}, \text{which might lead to a secondary reaction where SO2 might be released.}
$$
Typically, after Diels-Alder reaction with thiophene systems, if sulfur dioxide gets extruded, the product should be a benzene derivative where the benzene nucleus might still retain the methyl groups originally from the 2,5-dimethylthiophene; hence:
$$
6,7-\text{dimethyl-4,5-epoxy-5,6-dihydrophthalic anhydride}
$$

However, this might need a more specific structure name. To make a specific product structure drawing here:

Consider the Reactants and the Reaction:
**2,5-dimethylthiophene** + **maleic anhydride** → [4+2] cycloaddition → **Product**.

Based on [4+2] cycloaddition, the stage after the initial cycloaddition would be:
1. Maleic anhydride reacting with 2,5-dimethylthiophene generates a bridged (bicyclic) compound where the new six-membered ring formed has sulfur as one of its atoms initially.
2. It could be that sulfur might subsequently be converted into a sulfoxide which might be unstable and hence might lead to a subsequent loss of sulfur dioxide (SO2) leaving us with a benzene derivative.

Thus, for the "exo" product specific to the Diels-Alder reaction nomenclature, the maleic anhydride group should be found on the "exo" (outer) face of the bicyclic compound formed. 

### Product Structure:
To make this reasoning more structured, to find the major "exo" (and also "endo") products, the dienophile part should be such that the "bulky" part should be oriented away from the central part of the diene structure in the transition state (for exo addition).

However, a common answer here might be:
$$
4-methyl-1,2-dimethylbenzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid anhydride also represented as 3,6-dimethylphthalic anhydride
$$
However verify:

1. Let us draw it explicitly.
The reaction should create a bicyclic compound where sulfur dioxide might be extruded so that sulfone decomposes in a reverse chelotropic reaction possibly leading to a benzene derivative.

### Hence, structure:
Considering the structure of 2,5-dimethylthiophene reacts initially:
By reacting the thiophene derivative as a dienoid component and losing SO2 after the cycloaddition reaction, the process will likely lead to:
3,6-Dimethylphthalic anhydride.

Thus, it seems logical that the main product formed initially is a bridge compound containing sulfur which should lose SO2 quickly if the compound is not stable. To validate this, if you remove sulfur dioxide (SO2), what's left should be a benzene derivative where maleic anhydride has been added as a part of the structure.

To make a more "chemical" verifiable structure, the compound should be:
#### 3,6-Dimethylphthalic anhydride (also known as 3,6-dimethylbenz[d][1,3]dioxol-2,5-dione structure).

Let us draw out how we get there:
1. Initial cycloaddition product:
An adduct where the sulfur atom initially still exists within a bicyclic structure consisting of a six-membered ring fused to a thiophene ring having only reduced "aromaticity."
2. Decomposition such that sulfur dioxide is extruded, leaving us with a six-membered ring only (that is, benzene derivative).

The product should depict where the methyl groups stayed on the "2 and 5" positions relative to the thiophene’s initial structure. Hence those should translate roughly to "3 and 6" positions relative to benzene once SO2 is lost. 

For a pictorial drawing:

Reactant 2,5-dimethylthiophene is:
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\chemfig{*5(-S-=(-CH_3)-=-(-CH_3)=)}

$$
Here, the potential part that acts as a diene is a part of the aromatic structure.

$$
\chemfig{O=C(-[::180]O-[::270]C(=[::180]O)-[::270]C(=[::90]O))-O}
$$
The reaction product should hence be a reaction product structure such as:
$$
\chemfig{*6(-(=O)--(-CH_3)-(=O)-O-[,,,,,dashed](-[::-60]CH_3)=-=)}
$$
However电报 explicit reaction could yield:

$$
Which could then lose SO2 likely leading to a derivation benzene structure like:
$$
\underset{(anticipated benzene derivative)}{\chemfig{*6((-CH_3)--(-[::0]C(=[::90]O)-O-[::-90]C(=[::-90]O))=(-CH_3)-=)}}

However, the most accurate description might be thus:
