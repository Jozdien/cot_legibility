To solve for the minimum energy of a system where 13 identical particles each have a charge of $2e$ (where $e$ is the fundamental charge $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C), let us first describe the given situation:
    
1. We have a total of 13 particles where 12 of these particles are constrained to stay at a fixed distance of 2 meters from a point $P$, forming a spherical shell of radius $2$ meters centered around point $P$.
    
2. The 13th charge is fixed at the central point $P$.

The charge for every particle is $q = 2e$. Thus, the question is what is the minimum energy of this system where the electric potential energy of interaction among all charges needs to be summed according to Coulomb's law. The potential energy $U$ for two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by:
$$
U = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q_1q_2}{r}.
$$
In this case, $q_1 = q_2 = 2e$. Thus, the potential energy between two such charges separated by a distance $r$ is:
$$
U = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{(2e)(2e)}{r} = \frac{4e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\cdot \frac{1}{r} = \frac{e^2}{\pi\varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{1}{r}.
$$
However, the constant $ \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}$ is well known as the Coulomb constant ($k$), such that:
$$
k = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \approx 8.99 \times 10^9\ \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2.
$$
Thus, the potential energy can instead be represented as:
$$
U = k \cdot \frac{4e^2}{r}.
$$
However, the question statement mentions finding only the electric potential energy of the given system. The total potential energy $U_{\text{total}}$ of a system of multiple point charges is the sum of the potential energies for each pair of charges in the system where every pair is counted only once. For a system of $n$ charges $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$, the total potential energy is:
$$
U_{\text{total}} = \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} \frac{k q_i q_j}{r_{ij}}.
$$
However, another conventional way to express total potential energy is:
$$
U_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1, j\neq i}^{n} \frac{k q_i q_j}{r_{ij}}.
$$
For this specific problem, there are $13$ charges where one charge is at point $P$ and the other 12 charges are on a spherical shell of radius $2$ meters from point $P$. So, the charges are:
$$
q_0 \text{ (fixed at point $P$)} \text{ and } q_1, q_2, q_3, \ldots, q_{12} \text{ (each $2$ meters from point $P$)}.
$$
And given that $q_i = 2e$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, 12$, including the central charge $q_0$.

So, what we need here is the total potential energy which takes into account the pairwise interactions among all 13 charges where $q_1$ to $q_{12}$ are symmetrically distributed on a spherical shell centered on $q_{13}$ which is located at point $P$. However, there's a part that mentions "minimum energy," which suggests that the 12 charges should be positioned such that the mutual repulsion amongst themselves is minimized while retaining their $2$ meter distance from point $P$. Such a distribution would ideally make the mutual repulsion among the 12 charges on the spherical surface as small as possible while keeping equal pairwise distances (which reduces the total potential energy of the system).

The symmetric distribution that minimizes the energy among the 12 charges on the surface of a sphere is when the charges are equidistant from each other. The most symmetric distribution for $12$ particles on a sphere is likely an icosahedral configuration where the charges are placed at the vertices of a regular icosahedron (which has 12 vertices). However, the symmetric distribution can be a bit tricky to analyze explicitly for a general symmetric distribution.

However, what we need here is the total electrostatic potential energy of the system where each pairwise interaction needs to be calculated. Our task is thus to break this into three components:
1. Interactions between the central charge (charge at point $P$) and the other 12 charges (all $2$ meters away from $P$).
2. Interactions among the 12 charges themselves on the spherical surface (which need to be computed based on the pairwise distances among them).

#### Step-by-step breakdown of the energy calculations:

1. **Interaction between the central charge $q_0$ (also $2e$) fixed at point $P$ and the other $12$ charges fixed $2$ meters away from $P$:
$$
U_{\text{central}} = \sum_{i=1}^{12} \frac{k q_0 q_i}{2}.
$$
Given $q_0 = q_1 = q_2 = \cdots = q_{12 = 2e}$:
$$
U_{\text{central}} = \sum_{i=1}^{12} \frac{k (2e)(2e)}{2}.
$$
We iterate over $i = 1$ to $12$:
$$
U_{\text{central}} = 12 \times \frac{k (4e^2)}{2} = 12 \times \frac{8.99 \times 10^9 \times 4 \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2} = 12 \cdot 8.99 \times 10^9 \times 4 \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 / 2.
$$
But this seems a bit convoluted. First, simplify the unit part $12 \times 4k\frac{e^2}{2} = 24 k e^2$:
$$
= 24 \times \left(8.99 \times 10^9\right) \times \left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right)^2.
$$
Calculate:
$$
\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right)^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38}.
$$
$$
U_{\text{central}} = 24 \times 8.99 \times 10^9 \times 2.56 \times 10^{-38}.
$$
$$
= 24 \times 8.99 \times 2.56 \times 10^{-29}.
$$
$$
24 \times 8.99 \times 2.56 \approx 552.3456.
$$
$$
U_{\text{central}} \approx 552.3456 \times 10^{-29}.
$$
However, the true calculation must be verified properly:
$$
U_{\text{central}} = 12 \times \frac{k (2e) (2e)}{2} = 12 \times \big(k \cdot \frac{4e^2}{2}\big) = 12 \times \frac{4k e^2}{2} = 24ke^2.
$$
2. **Interaction among the $12$ charges on the spherical shell of radius $2$ meters:**
    
    An important part here is trying to estimate the "most symmetric" distribution such that the sum of the inter-particle potential energies among the $12$ charges should be symmetric such that the total potential energy due to those $12$ charges must be computed for all pairs among those $12$ charges such that $1 \leq i < j \leq 12$.

    The total potential energy due to the interactions among those 12 charges is:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{12} \sum_{j>i} \frac{k (2e) (2e)}{r_{ij}} = k (4e^2) \sum_{i=1}^{12} \sum_{j>i} \frac{1}{r_{ij}}.
$$
where $r_{ij}$ is the distance between charge $i$ and charge $j$ on the spherical surface of radius $2$ meters.
    
To make an educated guess about the “minimum energy” part, the $12$ charges should be spread out as symmetrically as possible on the spherical shell such that the charges are equidistant from each other as much as possible. For a symmetric distribution of $12$ charges on a sphere, an icosahedral configuration could be a candidate where the $12$ charges are placed at the 12 vertices of a regular icosahedron.

However, a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius $2$ meters has a fixed edge length which needs to be computed. To find the edge length $a$ of an icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius $R$, the formula is:
$$
R = \frac{a\sqrt{(5 + \sqrt{5})}}{2\sqrt{2}}.
$$
However, here $R=2$ meters:
$$
2 = \frac{a \sqrt{5 + \sqrt{5}}}{2\sqrt{2}} \Rightarrow a = \frac{4 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5 + \sqrt{5}}}.
$$
To solve for $a$:
$$
a = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5 + \sqrt{5}}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5 + 2.2361}} \approx \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7.2361}} \approx \frac{4 \times 1.4142}{\sqrt{7.2361}} \approx \frac{5.6568}{2.6901} \approx 2.1028.
$$
However, we need to make an iterative sum of the pairwise interactions which means:
$$
U_{\text{shell}} = k (4e^2) \sum_{i=1}^{11} \sum_{j=i+1}^{12} \frac{1}{r_{ij}} .
$$
However, a regular icosahedron has $12$ vertices where every vertex is connected via $5$ edges where each edge length $a$ is:
$$
a \approx 2.1028 \text{ meters (if $R=2$)}.
$$
Total edges in an icosahedron are $30$ edges (since an icosahedron has $30$ edges where every edge contributes one unique pair of interacting charges).

Thus, total pairwise interactions among the $12$ charges can be split into:
$$
U_{\text{shell}} = k (4e^2) \left[\frac{n_{\text{edges}}}{a} +\text{(sum over all other non-edge pairs)}\right].
$$
But what matters here is what the actual pairwise distances are for all pairs among the $12$ icosahedron vertices. However, there are $66$ pairs for $12$ vertices ($\binom{12}{2} = 66$). Among those:
$$
\text{30 pairs have distance $a$, where $a = \frac{4}{\sqrt{\varphi}}} \text{ (where $\varphi = (1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2$ is the golden ratio, and $a$ is the edge length of the icosahedron).}
$$

However, let us make a more dedicated analysis for a regular icosahedron with a circumradius $R$ of $2$ meters:
$$
\text{Mutual distances are two distinct lengths: edge length ($a$) and the other distance is the "larger" pair-wise distance which is the length of the "non-adjacent" vertices (which would be equal to the "longer" diagonal of the pentagon formed by any group of $5$ adjacent vertices, which itself depends on the edge length).
$$
a = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{5 + \sqrt{5}}} \approx 2.1028.
$$

To solve for the total pairwise potential energy within the $12$ charges on the shell requires us to sum the potential energy for every pair of charges:
$$
U_{\text{shell}} = \sum_{i=1}^{12} \sum_{j>i} \frac{k \cdot 4e^2}{r_{ij}}.
$$
This sum yields:
$$
= 4k e^2 \sum_{i=1}^{12} \sum_{j=i+1}^{12} \frac{1}{r_{ij}}.
$$
The regular icosahedron has $30$ edges where edge-length is $a$:
$$
U_{\text{edge}}^{(a)} = \frac{4ke^2}{a} \times 30.
$$
However, the rest of pairwise distances (there are $36$ other pairs apart from the $30$ edges since $66 - 30 = 36$) need another pairwise distance $d$ which should be computed explicitly based on the icosahedral geometry. The "next shortest edge" (for non-adjacent vertices) should be computed based on the "second neighbor" distance on an icosahedron. However, the second shortest distance $d$ between two non-adjacent vertices can be found geometrically as:
$$
d = a \sin(72^\circ) = 2 \sin(\theta),
$$
where $\theta$ is the central angle formed by two second-neighbor vertices. However, here’s another way to solve for the length $d$ if two vertices aren’t directly connected by an edge. 

The distance between two non-connected edges can be calculated by calculating the angle subtended at the center by two vertices which are connected via $2$ edges (i.e., one vertex apart on the icosahedral graph). However, it seems that the "optimal" distribution should be such that all charges are as far away from each other as possible. Another well-known distribution where pairwise repulsion is minimized is the Thomson problem (which aims to find the optimal distribution of $n$ electrons on a unit sphere such that the electrostatic potential energy is minimized).

For $12$ points on a sphere such that the Coulomb potential energy is minimized, there is a well-known result from the Thomson problem where the $12$ points are likely placed at the vertices of an icosahedron. However, another well-known solution for this is an arrangement called the "ideal" $12$-point distribution on a unit sphere ($12$ point charges on a sphere where $R=1$ in the standard Thomson problem).

However, the total potential energy should be computed explicitly here. We need the total potential energy expressed explicitly.

To make a reasonable approximation, recall that the total potential energy can be divided into two main parts:
1. Interactions between the fixed central charge (at $P$) and the other $12$ charges.
$$
U_{\text{central}} = 12 \times (k \times \frac{4e^2}{2}) = 24 ke^2.
$$
2. Interactions among the $12$ charges themselves on the spherical shell.
$$
U_{\text{shell}} = k \cdot 4e^2 \left(\sum_{i=1}^{11} \sum_{j=i+1}^{12} \frac{1}{r_{ij}}\right).
$$

First, recall that:
$$
\binom{12}{2} = \binom{12}{2} = 66.
$$
Total pairs are $66$. First, calculate the $24ke^2$ part first:
$$
24 \times \big(8.99 \times 10^9\big) \times \big(2.56 \times 10^{-38}\big) = 552.3456 \times 10^{-29} .
$$
However, this value seems a bit small for what would be expected for total potential energy. Convert it to a more recognizable form:
$$
\approx 552.3456 \times 10^{-29} \text{ Joules}.
$$
$$
= 5.523456 \times 10^{-27} \text{ Joules}.
$$

However, we need to make a full calculation for $U_{\text{shell}}$.

Using the regular icosahedral arrangement seems a good start where edge length $a \approx 2.1028$ (when $R=2$ meters). From here, let us use what was mentioned previously:
$$
\sum_{j>i} \frac{1}r_{ij}.
$$
For an icosahedron:
$$
30 \text{ edges have distance $a \approx 2.1028$ meters}.
$$
$$
\text{Total of $66$ pairs overall.}
$$
Thus, $36$ pairs should correspond to some other distance $d$ such that $d \geq 2.1028$.

To solve for the total potential energy explicitly, an alternative way to solve analytically is by using the Thomson problem result where $12$ points on a unit sphere should be found such that the total potential energy is minimized. 

From solutions of Thomson problem solutions tabulated for $n=12$, the total potential energy for $n$ charges on a unit sphere $n=12$ is approximately $110.69$ for a unit charge on a unit sphere with $k=1$ (see well-known results).

For $12$ particles on a unit sphere (radius $1$), the total potential energy for unit charges ($e=1$) can be interpreted based on:
$$
U_{\text{Thomson}} = 110.69 \times k.
$$

However, for $n=12$ charges on a sphere of radius $R$, where charges are $2e$, the interaction potential scales as follows:

Total interaction energy on sphere of radius $R$ with charges $2e$:
$$
U_{\text{Thomson}}(R, 2e) = k \times (2e) \times (2e) \times \frac{\text{(Thomson problem solution for $n=12$ on a unit sphere)}}{R}.
$$
$$
= \frac{4k e^2 \times 110.69}{R}.
$$
However here we need to make an exact calculation where initially converted to Coulomb constant $k$.

Following Thomson problem analysis for $12$ charges on a unit sphere the solution is given such that total potential energy for $12$ unit charges on a unit sphere is:
$$
U_{\text{Thomson}} \approx 110.690388 \left(\frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}\right) \approx 110.690388ke^2,
$$
normalized for unit charge $e=1$ charges on a unit sphere $R=1$.

So when we have charges on a sphere of radius $2$ meters with charge $2e$:
$$
U_{\text{shell}} \simeq 4ke^2 \times \frac{110.69}{2} = 2 \times 110.69ke^2.
$$
Total energy $U_{\text{total}}$ now combines $U_{\text{central}}$ with $U
