# Original Question

An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has engineered an extraordinary spacecraft capable of traveling at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?

To solve for how long it will take for an alien astronaut to reach Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud while traveling at a speed of $0.99999987 \times c$, where $c$ is the speed of light, we need to first recall some fundamental principles of special relativity. 

To find the proper time experienced by the astronaut (i.e., time experienced within the spacecraft frame), we need to first determine the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way and is located approximately 160,000 light years away from Earth. 

The question states that the spacecraft travels at a speed denoted as $0.99999987 \times c$. Therefore, we need to solve for the proper time $ \tau $ experienced by the astronaut while traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. 

However, the question mentions that the "average lifetime" of the aliens is roughly 150 solar years, which seems extraneous given what we need to find (which is how long it will take for a 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from the perspective of the astronaut). However, what seems important here is the "travel time" experienced by the astronaut ("proper time"), which depends on the speed of the spacecraft ($0.99999987 \times c$) and the distance to Earth (160,000 light years away).

#### Distance and Velocity:
1. Let $D$ represent the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. According to the question, the approximate distance $D$ is:
$$
D = 160,000 \text{ light-years}.
$$

2. The velocity $v$ of the spacecraft is given as:
$$
v = 0.99999987 \, c.
$$

#### Time from Earth's Perspective ("Coordinate Time" $t$):
The coordinate time $t$ (i.e., time measured from an observer on Earth) for the spacecraft traveling at velocity $v$ can be calculated using the formula:
$$
t = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \text{ light-years}}{0.99999987 \, c}.
$$
Since "light-years" is a unit of distance where $1 \text{ light-year}$ is the distance light travels in one year (i.e., $1 \, \text{light-year} = c \times 1 \, \text{year}$), the formula simplifies numerically to:
$$
t = \frac{160,000 \, (c \times 1 \text{ year})}{0.99999987 \, c} = \frac{160,000 \, c \text{ year}}{0.99999987 \, c} = \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \text{ years}.
$$
Since $0.99999987 \approx 1$ when rounded here:
$$
t \approx \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \text{ years} \approx 160,000.0208 \text{ years}.
$$
So, it would take approximately 160,000.0208 years from the perspective of an observer on Earth.

#### Time from the Astronaut's Perspective ("Proper Time" $\tau$):
The proper time $\tau$ experienced by someone aboard a spacecraft traveling at a velocity $v$ relative to an inertial frame where the distance $D$ is fixed can be found from the time dilation formula, which tells us that:
$$
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = t \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}},
$$
where $\gamma$ (the Lorentz factor) is defined as:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
$$

For $v = 0.99999987 \times c$, substitute $v = 0.99999987 \times c$ into the Lorentz factor:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{0.99999987 \, c}{cq}\right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}}.
$$

Calculate $(0.99999987)^2$ approximately:
$$
(0.99999987)^2 \approx (1 - 1.3 \times 10^{-7})^2.
$$
However, a more intuitive way to refine $(0.99999987)^2$ might be:
$$
(0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997400000169.
$$
So,
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9999997400000169}}.
$$
Hence,
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0000002599999831}}.
$$
We approximate:
$$
1 - 0.9999997400000169 \approx 0.0000002599999831 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
$$
Thus,
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}}.
$$
We need the precise calculation:
$$
\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} = \sqrt{2.6} \times 10^{-3.5}.
$$
However, for a simpler round-off:
$$
\gamma \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}} \approx \frac{1}{5.09901951 \times 10^{-4}} \approx \frac{10000}{5.09901951} \approx 1961.1615.
$$
This seems a bit roundabout, so we need a more straightforward way to solve for $\gamma$. Another way to write the equation for $\gamma$ when $v = (1 - \varepsilon) c$ where $\varepsilon \ll 1$ is as follows:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (1 - \epsilon)^2}} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (1 - 2\epsilon)}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\epsilon}},
$$
where $v = (1 - \epsilon)c$. For $v = 0.99999987 \times c$, let us write $0.99999987 = 1 - \epsilon$ where $\epsilon = 1 - 0.99999987 = 1.3 \times 10^{-7}$. 

Using the binomial approximation for $1 - (1 - \epsilon)^2$:
$$
1 - (1 - \epsilon)^2 = 1 - (1 - 2\epsilon + \epsilon^2) \approx 1 - (1 - 2\epsilon) \text{ (since } \epsilon^2 \text{ is negligible for very small } \epsilon)},
$$
$$
\gamma \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\epsilon}}.
$$
Given that $\epsilon = 1.3 \times 10^{-7}$ here:
$$
\gamma \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \times 1.3 \times 10^{-7}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^(-7)}}.
$$
$$
\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx \sqrt{2.6} \times 10^{-3.5} \approx 1.61245 \times 10^{-3.5}.
$$
However, this roundabout seems inaccurate here again. Instead solve again:
$$
\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} = \sqrt{260 \times 10^{-9}} = \sqrt{260} \times 10^{-4.5}.
$$
Thus we need,
$$
\sqrt{260} \approx 16.1245,
$$
hence,
$$
\gamma \approx \frac{10^4.5}{16.1245} \approx \frac{1}{16.1245} \times \sqrt{10} \times 10^4.
$$
But $\sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623$, thus:
$$
\gamma \approx \frac{3.1623 \times 10000}{16.1245} \approx \frac{31623}{16.1245} \approx 1961.
$$

#### Using $t$ and $\gamma$:
Returning to the proper time $\tau$ calculation:
$$
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000.0208}{1961} \text{ years}.
$$
$$
\tau \approx \frac{160,000.0208}{1961} \approx 81.5910 \text{ years}.
$$
This means that if the spacecraft travels from the Large Magellanic Cloud at $0.99999987 \times c$, it would take approximately $81.59$ years for the astronaut from his point of view (proper time), given our roundings and approximations.

Consequently, if the astronaut was initially 22 years old, once he reaches Earth, he should be approximately:
$$
22 \text{ years (initial age)} + 81.59 \text{ years} \approx 103.59 \text{ years old},
$$
in his frame of reference.

However, we need another quick check here. Another way to directly compute the proper time $\tau$ is:
$$
\tau = \frac{D}{v} \sqrt{1 - \beta^2} \text{ where } \beta = \frac{v}{c}.
$$
Given $D = 160,000 \text{ light years} = 160,000 \, c \cdot \text{years}$, $v = 0.99999987 \, c,$ and $\beta = 0.99999987$:
$$
\tau = \frac{160,000 \times c}{0.99999987 \, c} \sqrt{1 - (0.999999)^2} \approx \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}.
$$
We previously found that:
$$
\gamma \approx 1961.1615,
$$
so $\sqrt{1 - (0.999999)^2} \approx \frac{1}{\gamma}$. Given that:
$$
\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} = \sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2} \implies \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \implies \sqrt{1 - \beta^2} = \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.099 \times 10^{-4}.
$$
So plug this directly into the expression for $\tau$:
$$
\tau = \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \times 5.099 \times 10^{-4} \approx 160,000.0208 \times 5.099 \times 10^{-4}.
$$
This yields:
$$
\tau \approx 160,000.0208 \times 5.099 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.59.
$$
The reasoning seems confident thus far.

However, a verification check might include another round of calculation:
Recall that:
$$
\tau = \frac{D}{\gamma v}.
$$
Here $D (160,000 \text{ light-years})$ should be measured from Earth's frame where the distance is given:
$$
\tau = \frac{160,000 \text{ (light-years)}}{1961.1615 \times 0.99999987 \, c} = \frac{160,000 \text{ (years)}}{1961.1615 \times 0.99999987} \approx \frac{160,000}{1961.1615 \times 0.99999987} \text{ years}.
$$
Calculating:
$$
160,000 \div (1961.1615 \times 0.99999987) \approx 81.59 \text{ years}.
$$

So, the astronaut takes approximately $81.59$ years (from his frame of reference) to reach Earth traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud at a speed of $0.99999987 \, c$. 

This reasoning thus makes us quite confident that the answer should be approximately:
$$
\boxed{81.59} \text{ years}.
$$
However, if we round the $0.99999987$ part differently or round the square root value differently, one might get a very slight variance in the answer. However, rounding everything appropriately should make this round-off error negligible.

Double checking the actual roundings might make us round $160,000.0208 \text{ years}$ to $160,000 \text{ years}$ for coordinate time in our main $t \simeq 160,000 \text{ years}$ calculation. 

Another round of simplifying $\gamma$ step-by-step without round-off until the last step:
Given $1 - \beta^2$ where $\beta = 0.99999987$, we need:
$$
\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.99999987^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.9999997400000169} = \sqrt{0.0000002599999831} \\
\approx \sqrt{2.6 \textrm{ (rounded value from $2.599999831 \times 10^{-7}$)}} \times 10^{-4} \\
\approx 1.61245 \times 10^{-3.5}.
$$
This tells us that:
$$
\tau \approx \frac{160,000 \, c \cdot \text{year}}{0.99999987 \, c} \times 1.61245 \times 10^{-4} = \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \times 1.61245 \times 10^{-4} \text{ years}.
$$
Another round of $1.61245$-based calculation:
$$
\frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000.0208.
$$
Thus:
$$
\tau \approx 160,000.0208 \times qi.61245 \times 10^{-4}.
$$
$$
160,000.0208 \times qi.61245 \times 10^{-4} = 160,000.0208 \times 0.000161245.
$$
$$
160,000.0208 \times 0.000161245 \approx 25.79924917.
$$
This seems somewhat off compared to our first round where $\tau \approx 81.59$ years. Therefore, we need to verify where this round is incorrect.

Another direct way to validate:
Given $v/c = 0.99999987 \implies \beta = 0.99999987$, so:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}}.
$$
We need to make a more precise calculation for $1 - (0.99999987)^2$:
Without rounding $0.99999987^2$ until completing the calculations:
$$
(0.99999987)^2 = 0.9999997400000169,
$$
thus,
$$
1 - 0.9999997400000169 = 0.0000002599999831.
$$
Calculate:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0000002599999831}} \approx \frac{1}{0.0005099999834313676} \approx 1960.7845.
$$
Now, we need the time experienced by Earth:
$$
t = \frac{D}{v} \approx \frac{l160\,000\text{ (light-years)}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000.0208 \text{ years}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} \approx \frac{160,000.0208\text{ years}}{1960.7845} \approx 81.6 \text{ years}.
$$
So once again, following this round with a conservative round-off makes us quite confident:
$\tau$ should be approximately $81.6$ years (which makes sense after round-off errors).

Another check can be done using the following known approximation for large $\gamma$ values:
$$
\tau \approx \frac{D_p}{\gamma v} = \frac{D_p}{\gamma \beta c}.
$$
However, another round might require another check on the "length contraction" in the spacecraft's frame (which could be a bit confusing because here we need only the proper time, but it is important to make sure).
So what would be the contracted distance as seen from astronauts' frame of reference (such that the astronaut sees the Earth approaching at velocity $0.99999987 \, c$):
$$
D_{\text{contracted}} = \frac{D}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000}{1961}.
$$
$$
D_{\text{contracted}} \approx 161,000 / 1961.1615 \approx 81.58 \text{ light-year}.
$$
Time traveled in astronaut's frame given this contracted distance:
$$
\tau = \frac{81.58 \text{ light-year}}{0.99999987c}.
$$
$$
\tau = \frac{81.58 \text{ light-year}}{0.99999987 \cdot c} = 81.58 \text{ years} \text{ (since light-year is $c \times 1$ year, thus dividing by $c$ units cancels out $c$ units, leaving us with 81.58 years as well)}.
$$

So overall, both methods reaffirm our answer must be around $81.59$ (rounded).

Thus once again, the answer should be verified once more as approximately $\boxed{81.6}$ years (rounding to the nearest tenth shouldn't make a significant difference in the reasoning).

However, one needs to verify whether the $160,000$ light years distance given here is the "proper distance" (i.e., the distance measured in the rest frame where Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud are defined). Thus treating $D = 160,000$ light years seems fine here.

Based on our roundings here, it seems that $81.59$ seems correct. Another valid checks are:
1. Confirming the round-off error might make us round to $1961$ for $\gamma$, thus:
$$
\gamma \approx 1960.8 \text{ (rounded accurately)}.
$$
2. To reach an accurate answer based on the round-off:
$$
\tau \approx 81.6 \text{ years seems sufficiently accurate}.
$$
However, it seems that rounding might make a slight difference such that:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}}.
$$
Clearly:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}},
$$
where $v = 0.99999987c$, thus $\epsilon = 1 - \beta = 1 - 0.99999987 = 1.3 \times 10^{-7}$.
$$
\gamma = \cot\left(\frac{1}{2} \sin^{-1}(2 \epsilon - \epsilon^2)\right) \text{ (alternate verification approach)}:
$$
Thus for $v \rightarrow c$:
Maximum $\gamma = \cot\left(\frac{1}{2} \sin^{-1}(2 \times
