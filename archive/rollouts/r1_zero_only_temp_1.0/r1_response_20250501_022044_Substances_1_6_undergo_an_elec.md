To resolve the question of the order in which the given substances should be arranged based on the increasing weight fraction yield of the para-isomer formed during an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine, we need to remember how substituents on the benzene ring influence electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions.

The question mentions that substances 1 through 6 react with an excess of bromine where "only one monobromo derivative is formed." However, this might be a slight misunderstanding because usually, for a monosubstituted benzene (like those listed here), electrophilic bromination can lead to three isomers: ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4) isomers unless the substituent on the benzene ring makes one specific site highly favored due to its directing effect.

However, what we need here is an analysis of the yield of the para-isomer specifically. The question thus requires us to understand whether and how substituents on the benzene ring influence the distribution of ortho and para isomers versus the meta isomer. 

This question hinges on the directing effect of the substituents already on the benzene ring such as $-\text{CH}_3$, $-\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5$, $-\text{Cl}$, $-\text{NO}_2$, $-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5$ and $-\text{COOH}$. 

Typically, substituents are classified into two main categories:
1) **Activating and ortho-/para-directing groups:** These groups (usually electron-donating groups such as alkyl groups, hydroxyl groups, or halogens) increase the electron density on the benzene ring and direct the incoming electrophile predominantly to the ortho and para positions. Examples include alkyl groups like $-\text{CH}_3$, $- \text{C}_2\text{H}_5$, halogens like $-\text{Cl}$, and groups such as $-\text{NH}_2$, $-\text{OH}$, and $-\text{OCH}_3$.

2) **Deactivating groups which are further classified into:**
    - **Deactivating and meta-directing groups:** These groups (usually electron-withdrawing except halogen atoms) decrease the electron density on the benzene ring and direct the incoming electrophile predominantly to the meta position. Examples include $-\text{NO}_2$, $-\text{CN}$, $-\text{SO}_3\text{H}$, and $-\text{COOH}$.
    - **Deactivating but ortho-/para-directing groups:** Halogens like $-\text{Cl}$, $-\text{Br}$, and $-\text{I}$ fall into this category. Although they withdraw electrons inductively, they also donate electrons through resonance, which makes them deactivating overall but still ortho-/para-directing.

Based on the question, we need to compare the "weight fraction yield" of the para-isomer formed when each substance reacts with an excess of bromine. 

Following standard reaction outcome distributions for electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions on monosubstituted benzenes:
1) For alkyl groups such as $-\text{[CH}_3\text{]}$ (toluene), $-\text{[C}_2\text{H}_5]$ (ethylbenzene), which are activating and ortho-/para-directing, the reaction predominantly yields a mixture of ortho (o-) and para (p-) substituted products where the para product is usually favored due to less steric hindrance compared to ortho substitution.
2) For electron-withdrawing groups such as $-\text{[NO}_2]$ (nitrobenzene) and $-\text{[COOH]}$ (benzoic acid), which are deactivating and meta-directing, the reaction yields predominantly a meta (m-) isomer if only one monobromo derivative is formed where bromination takes place mostly at the meta position unless the question implies that the para position might still be preferred in some cases where only one monobromo derivative is formed. However, usually such reactions still give three reaction isomers where the meta position dominates - yet it seems here that the question assumes a single monobromo derivative is formed where the question's statement seems a bit incorrect or needs some assumptions. Another part of the question might be that some groups such as $-\text{[COOC}_2\text{H}_5]$ (phenyl acetate) should be considered similarly to $-\text{[COOH]}$ because the $-\text{COOR}$ group behaves similarly to $-\text{COOH}$ in terms of directing effects.
3) For halogens such as $-\text{Cl}$ (chlorobenzene), which are deactivating yet ortho-/para-directing, bromination will give a mixture of ortho and para products where the para product tends to be favored due to less steric hindrance.

However, what matters here is strictly the "para-isomer yield" for each given substance. 

The question statement only asks us to rank the given substances based on the "increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield." 

### Key Substituents and Their Directing Effects:

1) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH}_3$ (toluene): The $-\text{CH}_3$ group is an activating group and an ortho-/para-directing group. The reaction will generate a mixture of ortho and para isomers where the ortho position is usually sterically hindered compared to the para position; hence, the ortho/para product distribution might be such that the para product is the major isomer among the two (excluding a small amount of meta isomer which is usually negligible here).

2) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-COOC}_2\text{H}_5$ (ethyl benzoate): The $-\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5$ group is an electron-withdrawing group similar to $-\text{COOH}$, which makes it a meta-directing and deactivating group. Consequently, the major product should be the meta isomer. However, some minor products could still include ortho and para isomers where the para-isomer yield would be low compared to the meta isomer.

3) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-Cl$ (chlorobenzene): The $-\text{Cl}$ group is a deactivating group because of its electronegativity, but it is also ortho-/para-directing due to resonance stabilization at the ortho and para positions where the $\text{Cl}$ donates electron density through resonance while withdrawing electron density inductively. Thus, bromination results in ortho and para products where the ortho product might be somewhat hindered by the close proximity of the chlorine atom so that the para product might be favored among ortho vs. para.

4) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{NO}_2$ (nitrobenzene): The $-\text{NO}_2$ group is a strong deactivating group and is meta-directing. Thus, bromination should give a meta product primarily. Hence, yield of the para isomer should be quite low here.

5) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5$ (ethylbenzene): The $-\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3$ group is an alkyl group similar to $-\text{CH}_3$, which is an activating and ortho-/para-directing group. Therefore, bromination should yield ortho and para products where the para position might be favored due to less steric hindrance compared to the ortho position.

6) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{COOH}$ (benzoic acid): The $-\text{COOH}$ group is a deactivating and meta-directing group. Thus, the reaction should yield a meta product primarily. The para-isomer yield should be quite low here.

To rank substances based on the "increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield," we need to compare substances with predominantly ortho/para-directing effects against those that are meta-directing. Since group $-\text{NO}_2$ and $-\text{COOH}$ are strongly meta-directing, compounds containing these substituents should theoretically have lower para-isomer yield compared to those with ortho/para-directing groups such as $-\text{CH}_3$ or $-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5$.

Based on the described effects:
#### Substances that are meta-directing (low para-isomer yield):
    - $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-COOC}_2\text{H}_5$
    - $\text{C}_6\mathrm{H}_5-\text{NO}_2$
    - $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{COOH}$

#### Substances that are ortho-/para-directing (higher para-isomer yield):
    - $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{CH}_3$
    - $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{Cl}$
    - $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5$

However, among the ortho/para-directing substituents, the $-\text{Cl}$ group is deactivating while $-\text{CH}_3$ and $-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5$ are activating. However, the question is only about the "para-isomer yield," so steric hindrance might affect the distribution between ortho and para.

Generally speaking, the actual ortho/para ratio differs due to steric hindrance where the ortho position might be less favored compared to the para position for bulky groups like $-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5$ where the para yield should be higher compared to $-\text{CH}_3$ group's para yield due to the greater steric hindrance at the ortho position for $-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5$.

Conversely, for the meta-directing groups like $-\text{NO}_2$, $-\text{COOH}$, and $-\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5$, the para isomer yield should be very low. However, $-\text{COOH}$ is a stronger electron-withdrawing group than $-\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5$, so $-\text{NO}_2$ is one of the strongest electron-withdrawing groups which makes the meta-isomer even more favored.

Based on this, substances such as $-\text{[NO}_2]$ and $-\text{[COOH]}$ should have very low yields for the para isomer compared ortho/para-directing groups like $-\text{[CH}_3]$ and $-\text{[C}_2\text{H}_5]$. 

Considering the following reasoning, we arrange the substances such that the ones where the para isomer is least favored are placed first (i.e., meta-directing groups where meta isomers are predominantly formed). However, the typical order here might depend on the steric and electronic effects. 

Let us check experimental data or literature for a more precise order. Normally, meta-directing groups make the meta isomer the major product where the para isomer yield is typically minimal due to competition from the meta position. 

Thus, the order could roughly be:
1) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-NO}_2$ (nitrobenzene)
2) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-COOH}$ (benzoic acid)
3) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-COOC}_2\text{H}_5$ (ethyl benzoate)
4) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-Cl}$ (chlorobenzene)
5) $\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-CH}_3$ (toluene)
6) $- \text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-C}_2\text{H}_5}$ (ethylbenzene)

However, a big part here is making sure that our reasoning is valid:
    
For ortho/para-directing groups, the usual ortho/para ratio is not necessarily equal; para-isomers are often favored because of steric hindrance at the ortho position. However, the actual para yield can be approximately calculated if we know the specific isomer distributions. 

However, a well-known fact here is that for toluene, bromination leads to a distribution such that the para product typically constitutes a majority of the ortho/para distribution (since the total ortho/para distribution is usually 30-70%). For chlorobenzene, it is also ortho/para-directing but not as activating as an alkyl group like $-\text{CH}_3$ or $- \text{C}_2\text{H}_5}$, so the para product is still favored over the ortho because of less steric hindrance. 

However, it might be useful to verify the relative "strongness" of the meta-directing groups. $-\text{NO}_2$ is a strong deactivator and meta-director. The carboxylic group $-\text{COOH}$ is also a meta-directing group but slightly less deactivating than $-\text{NO}_2$. The ester group $-\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5$ should also be meta-directing but less influential than $-\text{COOH}$ in terms of deactivating strength (since $-\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5$ is similarly meta-directing but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as $-\text{NO}_2$ or possibly $-\text{COOH}$).

Thus, another possible ordering could be:
Meta-directing groups (least para isomer yield):
$\text{C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-NO}_2\text{, C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-COOH and C}_6\text{H}_5\text{-COOC}_2\text{H}_5}$ should yield a low para-isomer fraction compared to the others (ortho/para-directing groups $-\text{CH}_3, -\text{C}_2\text{H}_5}, -\text{Cl}$).

So, let us compare the "strongness" of deactivating groups as follows ($-\text{NO}_2}$ is the strongest among meta-directing groups here, followed by $-\text{COOH}$ and $-\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5}$).

However, another important factor is that within meta-directing groups, the para-isomer yield might be very similar and low overall. Usually, ortho/para-directing groups produce a higher yield of the para-isomer than meta-directing groups.

To verify the ortho/para ratio for $-\text{CH}_3$ versus $-\text{NO}_2$, the bromination of toluene yields primarily para-bromotoluene (around 33% para and 67% ortho, where sometimes the actual distribution might lean towards a slightly higher ortho yield initially due to two ortho positions vs. one para position, but sterically para is favored so less sterically hindered, so usually 40% ortho and 60% para for total ortho + para product).

However, in practice, the para-isomer yield for "alkyl groups" should be higher compared to the $-\text{Cl}$ group which is also ortho/para-directing but deactivating.

Thus comparing among these ortho/para-directing groups:
1) For $-\text{CH}_3$ group (toluene), bromination yields a significant fraction of para product among ortho and para isomers where the ortho position might be sterically hindered so that the para isomer might actually comprise around 30-40% of total products formed (with majority being para among ortho and para distribution).
2) For $-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5}$ group (ethylbenzene), bromination also yields a significant portion of para product where the $-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5}$ group is bulkier than $-\text{CH}_3$, so the steric hindrance makes the para isomer favored even more compared to the ortho isomer. Thus, the ethylbenzene should have a higher para isomer yield compared to toluene.
3) For $-\text{Cl}$ group (chlorobenzene), bromination similarly directs to the ortho and para positions where steric hindrance favors the para product.

Thus, we initially ordered the "meta-directing" groups first because they should yield the least para-product. Now, among meta-directing groups, $-\text{NO}_2, -\text{COOH}, -\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5}$:

### The groups $-\text{NO}_2$ and $-\text{COOH}$ are both strong meta-directing groups where:
- $-\text{NO}_2$ is likely stronger in electron-withdrawing effect compared to $-\text{COOH}$.
- $-\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5}$ being an ester should still be meta-directing like $-\text{COOH}$, but might show a slightly less strong deactivating effect compared to $-\text{COOH}$ due to the $-\text{OC}_2\text{H}_5}$ part which donates a slight electron density.

Based on stronger deactivating and stronger meta-directing nature:
1) $-\text{NO}_2$ (nitrobenzene) should yield lowest para-isomer.
2) $-\text{COOH}$ (should be next with slightly weaker deactivating effect).
3) $-\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5}$ should be next.

However, for ortho/para-directing groups where the relative para-isomer yield should be higher:
1) $-\text{Cl}$ should yield a considerable fraction of para product but it is deactivating which might make the reaction slower $compared to toluene and ethylbenzene$.
2) $-\text{CH}_3$ should yield a significant para-product.
3) $-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5}$ should yield more para-product compared to $-\text{CH}_3$ because of the increased steric hindrance which makes the para position even more favorable compared to the ortho position.

Based on the described reasoning, a likely ascending order based on increasing para-isomer yield might be arranged thus:
$$
C_6H_5-NO_<\text{(strong meta-directing group, least para isomer yield)} < C_6H_5-COOH < C_6H_5-COOCH_2H_5 < C_6H_5-Cl < C_6H_5-CH_3 < C_6H_5-C_2H_5
$$
Thus, the answer should be ordered as follows:
**2, 6, 4, 3, 1, 5**. However, this answer seems a bit off because we need to verify if the question statement mentions what is given should be ordered according to increasing weight fraction of para-isomer yield. 

However, another part of our reasoning here seems a bit mixed up. Another part might be we need to make sure group deactivating power order might be $-\text{NO}_2 > -\text{COOH} > -\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5 > -\text{Cl} > -\text{CH}_3 > -\text{C}_2\text{H}_5}$, but we need to make sure $-\text{CH}_3$ and $-\text{C}_2\text{H}_5}$ are activating groups whereas $-\text{NO}_2$, $-\text{COPOH}$, $-\text{COOC}_2\text{H}_5}$ are deactivating groups.

Therefore, we need to make a comparison
