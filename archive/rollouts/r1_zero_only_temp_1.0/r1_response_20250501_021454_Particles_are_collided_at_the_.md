# Original Question

Particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector producing new type of particles that travel uninterrupted at ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around Lorentz factor of ~20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls. 
The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

What Lorentz factor is needed in order to have about two thirds of these particles reaching the detector inner walls?

To solve for what Lorentz factor is needed such that about two-thirds of the ultra-relativistic particles reach the inner walls of a spherical detector with a radius of $30$ meters, we need to analyze the situation given initially first.

The problem statement mentions that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector whose radius is $30$ meters. After the collision, "new type of particles" are produced which travel "uninterrupted" at "ultra-relativistic velocities highly centered around a Lorentz factor ($\gamma$) of approximately $20$. Notably, "one-third" of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector on average. 

The question now asks what Lorentz factor is needed such that "about two-thirds" of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. 

This question requires us to understand what happens to "highly relativistic" particles produced at the center of a spherical detector where:
- Initial situation: Lorentz factor $\gamma \approx 20$, one-third of the particles reach the detector walls.
- Goal: Find the new Lorentz factor such that two-thirds of the particles reach the detector walls.

However, an important part of the question is that the new type of particles are "fast-decaying" particles traveling "uninterrupted" at "ultra-relativistic" velocities until they decay. Thus, the key here is that while traveling "uninterrupted" until they either reach the detector walls or decay.

The "decay probability" for a particle can be modeled by an exponential decay law:
$$
N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\tau},
$$
where $N(t)$ is the number of particles remaining at time $t$, $N_0$ is the initial number of particles, and $\tau$ is the proper decay time (i.e., the mean lifetime of the particle in its rest frame).

However, what matters here is the "probability that a particle reaches the detector wall before decaying." For a particle moving at a velocity $v$, the time $t$ it takes to travel a distance $d$ (which is the distance from the center of the detector to the inner wall if the particle travels radially outward) is:
$$
t = \frac{d}{v}.
$$
The rest frame (proper) lifetime $\tau$ corresponds to a longer "laboratory frame" time $\tau_{\text{lab}}$ due to time dilation:
$$
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau,
$$
where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor defined as:
$$
\gamma = {\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}},
$$
which for ultra-relativistic velocities $v \approx c$, thus $\gamma \gg 1$, implies that:
$$
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau.
$$
However, what we need here is effectively the "lifetime" in the lab frame where the particle travels at a velocity close to $c$. Given an ultra-relativistic particle where $v \approx c$, the "distance until decay" (i.e., "decay length") in the laboratory frame is approximately:
$$
L_{\text{lab}} = v \tau_{\text{lab}} \approx c \gamma \tau,
$$
where $\tau$ is the proper lifetime of the particle (defined in the rest frame of the particle), and hence $c \tau$ is the "proper decay length" (i.e., the distance that a particle would travel if it only lived for one mean-lifetime $\tau$ while traveling at $c$, which is an idealized rest frame distance if it could decay instantaneously which isn't the actual rest frame decay length which should be zero).

Another way to see the decay length is:
$$
L_{\text{lab}} = \gamma v\tau,
$$
which makes us recall another fundamental expression for the decay length where once again, for ultra-relativistic particles ($v \approx c$),
$$
L_{\text{lab}} \approx c \gamma \tau,
$$
here $c\tau$ is usually denoted as $c\tau$, where $c\tau$ is the "proper decay length" (note that $c\tau$ is a fixed characteristic of the particle).

Thus, the probability that a particle produced at the center will reach the detector wall (which is at a distance $R$, where $R = 30$ meters) before it decays can be computed as follows:
$$
P(\text{reach wall}) = e^{-\frac{R}{c\gamma \tau}}
$$
This follows from the exponential decay probability distribution where the survival probability until time $t$ where $t = \frac{L}{c}$ ($L$ being the distance traveled until some point is reached) involves:
$$
P(\text{survive until $t$}) = e^{-t/\tau_{\text{lab}}}.
$$
However, what we need here is expressed in terms of distance rather than time. Thus, converting time $t$ into travel distance $L$ such that $t = \frac{L}{c}$:
$$
P(\text{survive until distance $L$}) = e^{-\frac{L}{c\tau_{\text{lab}}}}.
$$
However, such expressions require a double-check to make sure that the reasoning fits the standard exponential decay law properly. The standard derivation for the normalized exponential decay law for a particle traveling with velocity $v \approx c$ gives us:
$$
P(\text{survive until time $t$}) = e^{-t/\tau_{\text{lab}}},
$$
where $t = \frac{R}{c}$ if the particle needs to travel a distance $R$ until it reaches the wall. Thus:
$$
P(\text{survive until time $t = R/c}) = e^{-\frac{R}{c\tau_{\text{lab}}}} \text{ (where $t = \frac{R}{c}$)}.
$$
However, $\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau$, thus:
$$
P(\text{survive until $t = \frac{R}{c}$}) = e^\frac{-R}{c\gamma \tau}.
$$
Another alternative way to derive the same result is by interpreting $N(R)$ as the number of particles surviving until a distance $R$:
$$
\frac{N(R)}{N_0} = e^{-\frac{R}{\gamma c\tau}}.
$$
Another line commonly used in such problems is:
$$
\frac{N}{N_0} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right) = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\beta c\gamma \tau}\right).
$$
Since such particles are said to be "ultra-relativistic" ($\beta \approx 1$), $v \approx c$. Using $d = vt \approx ct$, the probability that a particle survives until it reaches a distance $R$ can be written as:
$$
\text{Probability} \approx \exp\left({-\frac{R}{c \gamma \tau}}\right).
$$

Initially, with a Lorentz factor $\gamma_1 \approx 20$, one-third of the particles reach the detector walls of $30$ meters:
$$
\frac{1}{3} \approx e^{-\frac{R}{c\gamma_1\tau}},
$$
where $R = 30$ meters. Thus:
$$
\frac{1}{3} \approx e^{-\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}}.
$$
Our goal is to find $\gamma_2$ such that two-thirds of the particles reach the detector walls:
$$
\frac{2}{3} \approx e^{-\frac{R}{c\gamma_2\tau}}.
$$
Since $R = 30$ meters here again:
$$
\frac{2}{3} \approx e^{-\frac{30}{c \gamma_2 \tau}}.
$$
To solve for $\gamma_1\tau$ in the initial condition:
$$
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}.
\\
\ln 3 = \frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \cdot \tau}.
$$
Thus,
$$
c \cdot 20 \tau = \frac{30}{\ln 3},
$$
or equivalently:
$$
c\tau = \frac{30}{20 \ln 3} = \frac{1.5}{\ln 3}.
$$
Now, for the second part where we seek $\gamma_2$ such that two-thirds of particles reach the walls:
$$
\ln \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) =-\frac{30}{c \gamma_2 \tau}.
$$
which implies:
$$
\ln \left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{30}{c \gamma_2 \tau}.
$$
We already found that $c\tau = \frac{30}{20\ln 3}$, so:
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{30}{c \tau \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
$$
Since $c\tau = \frac{30}{20 \ln 3}$ previously derived,
$$
c\tau = \frac{30}{20 \ln 3} \implies \frac{30}{c\tau} = 20 \ln 3.
$$
Thus substituting again in the equation for $\gamma_2$:
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{30}{\left(\frac{30}{20 \ln 3}\right) \cdot \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)} = \frac{20 \ln 3}{\ln \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
$$
Calculating the natural logarithms:
$$
\ln 3 \implies \text{approximately}\ 1.0986.
$$
$$
\ln \left(\frac{3}{2\right)} = \ln 3 - \ln 2.
$$
$$
\ln 2 \implies \text{approximately}\ 0.6931.
$$
$$
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 1.0986 - 0.6931 = 0.4055.
$$
Approximating these values for $\gamma_2$ yields:
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{20 \times 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx \frac{21.972}{0.4055} \approx 54.18.
$$

However, let us keep the natural logarithms in an exact form until the last step for precision:
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{20 \ln 3}{\ln \frac{3}{2}} = \frac{20 \ln 3}{\ln 3 - \ln 2}.
$$
The goal here is thus for us to solve:
$$
\frac{1}{3} = e^{-\frac{30}{c \tau \cdot 20}} \implies \frac{1}{3} = e^{-\frac{1.5}{c \tau}}.
$$
$$
\mathbb{E}_1 = \gamma_1 \tau,
$$
where here $ \mathbb{E}_1 \text{(fraction of particles reaching the wall)} = \frac{1}{3}$ so this suggests that when $\gamma_1 = 20$:
$$
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \cdot 20 \tau}\right).
$$
Similarly:
$$
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{c \cdot \gamma_2 \tau}\right).
$$
We need to solve for $\gamma_2$. Since both equations involve exponentials, let us solve for the exponent in both cases separately:
$$
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c \tau \cdot 20},
\qquad \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{c\tau \gamma_2}.
$$
Since $c\tau$ exists in both equations, we solve for it in the first one:
$$
\ln \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \ln (1) - \ln (3) = - \ln 3,
$$
so:
$$
-\ln 3 = -\frac{30}{c\tau \cdot 20} \implies \ln 3 = \frac{30}{c \tau \cdot 20}.
$$
Thus,
$$
c \tau = \frac{30}{20 \ln 3}.
$$
Similarly for the second part:
$$
\ln \left(\frac{2}{3\right) = \ln 2 - \ln 3.
$$
$$
\ln 2 - \ln 3 = -\frac{30}{c\tau\gamma_2} \implies \ln 3 - \ln 2 = \frac{30}{c \tau \gamma_2}.
$$

Therefore,
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{30}{(c \tau)(\ln 3 - \ln 2)}.
$$
We already know $c\tau$ from the first part:
$$
c\tau = \frac{30}{20 \ln 3}.
$$
Therefore:
$$
\gamma_2 = \frac{30}{(30 / (20 \ln 3)) \cdot (\ln 3 - \ln 2)} = \frac{30 \cdot 20 \ln 3}{30 \cdot (\ln 3 - \ln 2)} = \frac{20 \ln 3}{\ln 3 - \ln 2}.
$$
Thus, $\gamma_2$ is derived as:
$$
\boxed{\frac{20 \ln 3}{\ln 3 - \ln 2}}.
$$
This is approximately:
$$
\boxed{54.18}.
$$

This reasoning follows that a higher Lorentz factor is needed such that particles have a longer "effective" lifetime due to time dilation so that a larger fraction of particles make it to the detector wall (30 meters away) before decaying. 

We verified that one-third survives until the detector walls are reached when the Lorentz factor is about $20$. So it makes sense that a higher Lorentz factor should make the particles "live longer" in the lab frame, hence a bigger fraction could make it to the detector walls when the Lorentz factor is increased from $20$.
