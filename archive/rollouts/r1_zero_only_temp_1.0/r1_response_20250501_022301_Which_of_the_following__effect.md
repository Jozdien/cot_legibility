To solve for which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we need to recall what "spontaneously-broken symmetry" means in the context of particle physics. 

Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the ground state (or vacuum state) of a system does not exhibit the same symmetry as the underlying laws governing the system. A well-known example of spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics is the Higgs mechanism, which breaks the electroweak symmetry $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ down to $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$, giving mass to the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^0$ bosons while leaving the photon massless. 

The question mentions "effective particles," which typically refer to particles that emerge as a result of some underlying physical process or symmetry breaking. The question lists four particles: phonon, magnon, Higgs boson, and Cooper pair. 

1. **Phonon**: A phonon is a quasiparticle representing a quantum of vibrational energy in a crystal lattice. The symmetry that is spontaneously broken here is the continuous translational symmetry of space, which is broken down to a discrete translational symmetry when a crystal lattice forms. Thus, phonons are associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry (specifically, the breaking of continuous translational symmetry).

2. **Magnon**: A magnon is a quasiparticle representing a quantum of spin wave in a magnetic material. The symmetry that is spontaneously broken here is the rotational symmetry of spins in a ferromagnetic material where spins align in a particular direction below the Curie temperature, thus breaking the rotational symmetry. Thus, magnons are also associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry (specifically, the breaking of rotational symmetry).

3. **Higgs boson**: The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle associated with the Higgs field, which is responsible for the Higgs mechanism that breaks the electroweak symmetry $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ down to $U(1)_{\text{EM}}$. Thus, the Higgs boson is directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

4. **Cooper pair**: A Cooper pair consists of two electrons (or other fermions) that are bound together at low temperatures in a superconductor. The formation of Cooper pairs leads to superconductivity through the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory. The BCS theory itself involves a spontaneously-broken $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the phase of the superconducting order parameter. Thus, Cooper pairs are also associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

Based on the reasoning above, it seems that all the given particles are associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. However, a more careful analysis might be needed here. 

However, the question seems to be asking for a particle that is "not associated" with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. However, all the given particles are indeed associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. However, the question might be a bit misleading because a "Cooper pair" itself is not a "quasiparticle" in the same way that phonons and magnons are. However, the question seems to be asking for a particle that is not a result of a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

However, a more common way to interpret the question is that the "effective particles" here are "quasiparticles" such as phonons and magnons which are "emergent" due to a spontaneously-broken symmetry. However, the question seems to be a bit ambiguous because the Higgs boson itself is a fundamental particle rather than a quasiparticle. However, the question seems to be asking for a particle that is not a result of a spontaneously-broken symmetry.

However, a more common "quasiparticle" associated with superconductivity is the "Bogoliubov quasiparticle," which describes the excitations in a superconductor where the $U(1)$ symmetry is broken. However, a "Cooper pair" itself is a pair of electrons that form a bound state which leads to superconductivity where the $U(1)$ symmetry is broken. 

However, a "Cooper pair" itself is a bound state of two electrons formed due to an attractive interaction mediated by phonons (in conventional superconductors), which leads to a new ground state where the $U(1)$ symmetry is broken. However, the question seems to be asking for a particle that is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry.
