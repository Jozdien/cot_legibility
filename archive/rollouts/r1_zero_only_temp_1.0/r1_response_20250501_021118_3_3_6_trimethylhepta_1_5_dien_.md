To solve for what happens when reacting 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one with $m$-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), followed by the reaction with a solution generated from methyllithium (CH$_3$Li) treated with copper(I) iodide (CuI), we need to analyze each part separately.

#### Step 1: Analyze the structure of 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one.

The given compound is named as "3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one." 

Breaking down the name:
- **"hepta"** indicates a 7-carbon chain.
- **"1,5-dien"** indicates that there are two double bonds at carbon atoms 1 and 5 (counting from one end of the 7-carbon chain).
- **"4-one"** indicates a ketone group at carbon atom 4.
- **"3,3,6-trimethyl"** indicates that there are methyl substituents at carbon atoms 3 (there are two methyl groups on carbon 3) and another methyl group on carbon 6.

So, for the compound "3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one," the main carbon backbone is a 7-carbon chain where:
- The ketone group is on carbon 4.
- Double bonds are at carbons 1 and 5.
- There are three methyl groups, where two are on carbon 3 (making carbon 3 a quaternary carbon since it already has one carbon-carbon bond from carbon 2 to carbon 3 and another one connecting to carbon 4, so two methyl groups make it a four-bonded carbon) and one is on carbon 6.

We need to draw the structure based on this description:
1. The most descriptive part is the "4-one" which indicates the carbon chain should be numbered such that the ketone appears on carbon atom 4.
2. The double bonds are located on carbons 1 and 5 (hence, "-1,5-dien-").

To make a structure for this compound, let's build it step-by-step:
    
    Hepta indicates a 7-carbon chain backbone (C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6-C7).

1. Place a ketone on carbon 4 (i.e., the fourth carbon should have a double bond to an oxygen).
2. Double bonds should connect C1 and C2 (hepta-1,5-diene means there is another double bond connecting C5 and C6: C1=C2-C3-C4(=O)-C5=C6-C7.
3. The "3,3,6-trimethyl" part tells us that there should be methyl groups on carbon atom 3 (two methyl substituents on carbon 3, so C3 should have one hydrogen atom or another substituent replaced by a second methyl group) and another methyl group on carbon 6.

Thus, the complete structure looks like:
$$
\mathrm{CH_2=CH-C(=CH_3)-CH_2-C(=O)-CH=CH-CH_3}
$$
However, we need to make it clearer and check step-by-step:
$$
\mathrm{CH_2=CH-C(CH_3)_2-CH_2-C(=O)-CH=C(CH_3)-CH_3}
$$
However, the given question seems to have a mistake here. Another place where a methyl group could be placed on carbon 6 is made ambiguous here because the main chain should be defined such that the double bonds have priority numbering where the lower number takes preference where possible. Thus, verifying should be:
$$
\mathrm{H_2C=CH-C(CH_3)_2-CH_2-C(=O)-CH=CH-CH_3}
$$
Which makes us need to verify the main chain again. 

For a structure such as $\mathrm{H_2C=CH-C(CH_3)_2-CH_2-C(=O)-C(CH_3)=CH-CH_3}$, if we need to keep the double bonds on carbons 1 and 5 such that the carbon labelled "1" is part of the first double bond and carbon labelled "5" is part of the second double bond mentioned in "1,5-dien-4-one."

#### Step 3: Name validation for the compound should be double-checked because the naming should make it clear what compound we are referring to.

1. **Main chain is C7 starting from the terminal CH2=CH (C1 of double bond) to the other CH2-CH3 (C7), so the main chain would be:**
    
    Hepta-1,5-dien-4-one:
$$
\text{H}_2\text{C}=\underset{1}{\text{C}}\text{H}-\underset{2}{\text{C}}(\text{CH}_3)_2-\underset{3}{\text{C}}\text{H}_2-\underset{4}{\text{C}}(=\text{O})-\underset{5}{\text{C}}\text{H}=\underset{6}{\text{C}}\text{H}-\underset{7}{\text{CH}_3}
$$
    
Thus, it appears that:
1. Carbon 4 has a ketone.
2. Double bonds are from carbon 1 to carbon 2 and from carbon 5 to carbon 6.
3. Carbon 3 bears two methyl groups (thus, carbon 3 has no hydrogen atoms, making it a quaternary carbon connected to carbon 2, carbon 4, and two methyl groups).

#### Step 4: Reacting 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one with 1 equivalent of MCPBA.

MCPBA is a peracid (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid) typically used as an oxidizing agent for epoxidation reactions where it adds an oxygen atom across a carbon-carbon double bond to form an epoxide. 

However, the question mentions that two different products are formed in a 1:1 ratio when treating our given compound with one equivalent of MCPBA. Considering that our compound has two double bonds (C1=C2 and C5=C6), the reaction can potentially occur at either of those double bonds:
1. Epoxidation of the C1=C2 double bond forms an epoxide between carbon 1 and carbon 2.
2. Epoxidation of the C5=C6 double bond forms an epoxide between carbon 5 and carbon 6.

The question mentions that two different products are formed in a 1:1 ratio after treating with one equivalent of MCPBA. Therefore, what seems to be happening here is that MCPBA reacts with one of the two double bonds forming two different products because it either reacts with the first double bond (C1=C2) or the second double bond (C5=C6).

However, which double bond is more reactive might depend on steric and electronic factors. Due to the similar structure on both ends of the molecule except for the additional methyl group on carbon 6 (which might make the C5=C6 double bond slightly more sterically hindered compared to C1=C2), one might infer that both double bonds react approximately equally, thus giving a mixture where one product has the epoxide on the C1=C2 double bond and the other product has the epoxide on the C5=C6 double bond.

However, the typical behavior mentioned suggests there are two distinct products formed in a 1:1 ratio where both double bonds seem to be similarly reactive due to the absence of a significant inductive effect or steric hindrance favoring one double bond over the other.

#### Step 5: Treating methyllithium (CH3Li) with copper(I) iodide (CuI) generates a Gilman reagent.

When methyllithium (CH$_3$Li) is treated with lithium iodide (CuI), it forms a lithium dimethylcuprate reagent:
$$
2 \mathrm{CH_3Li} + \mathrm{CuI} \rightarrow (\mathrm{CH_3})_2\mathrm{CuLi} + \mathrm{LiI}
$$
The reagent $\mathrm{(CH_3)_2CuLi}$ is known as a Gilman reagent or a lithium dimethylcuprate.

#### Step 6: Reaction of lithium dimethylcuprate with the product mixture formed from the reaction of 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one and MCPBA.

The question states that an "excess" of the Gilman reagent is slowly added to the product mixture from Step 1. 

We need to understand what lithium dimethylcuprate does. Gilman reagents are often used for conjugate addition (Michael addition) to $\alpha, \beta$-unsaturated ketones. However, here our main product mixtures have an epoxide where one of the double bonds has been converted to an epoxide. 

However, another important reaction of Gilman reagents is their reaction with epoxides where they open the epoxide via an $S_N2$ reaction mechanism where the $\mathrm{CH_3}$ group from the dimethylcuprate serves as a nucleophile which attacks the less substituted carbon of the epoxide because the more hindered carbon is less accessible.

Consequently, if the first reaction step makes two products where one has an epoxide formed from C1-C2 double bond and another product has an epoxide formed from the C5-C6 double bond, we need to solve what happens when a Gilman reagent reacts with each epoxide independently.

#### Product when epoxide reacts with lithium dimethylcuprate:

##### Product A (epoxide between C1 and C2 double bond):

$$
\mathrm{CH_2{\underset{1}{\text{--}}}CH{\underset{2}{\text{--}}}C(CH_3)_2{\underset{3}{\text{--}}}CH_2{\underset{4}{\text{--}}}C(=O){\underset{5}{\text{--}}}CH=CH{\underset{6}{\text{--}}}CH_3} \text{ becomes }
\mathrm{\underset{1}{\underset{\overset{||}{\mathrm{O}}}{\text{C}}}H-\underset{2}{\underset{\overset{||}{\mathrm{O}}}{\text{C}}}H-C(CH_3)_2-CH_2-C(=O)-CH=CH-CH_3}
$$
After reacting with MCPBA, the compound has an epoxide at C1-C2 (while keeping the double bond between C5 and C6).

##### Product A reaction with Gilman reagent $(\mathrm{CH_3})_2\mathrm{CuLi}$:

$$
\mathrm{(CH_3)_2CuLi} \text{ attacks the less hindered carbon atom of the epoxide formed at C1-C2. Thus, the CH$_3$ group should primarily attack carbon atom number $\underline{1}$ (since carbon 1 is primary while carbon 2 is substituted by a quaternary carbon attached to carbon  which makes it tertiary in nature, although part of a quaternary carbon structure).}

##### Product B (epoxide from C5-C6 double bond):

$$
\mathrm{CH_2=CH-C(CH_3)_2-CH_2-C(=O)-CH=CH-CH_3} \text{ becomes }
\mathrm{CH_2=CH-C(CH_3)_2-CH_2-C(=O)-\underset{5}{\underset{\overset{||}{\mathrm{O}}}{\text{C}}}H-\underset{6}{\underset{\overset{||}{\mathrm{O}}}{\text{C}}}H-CH}_3
$$
After reacting with MCPBA another compound has an epoxide formed at C5-C6 (while keeping the double bond between C1 and C2).

##### Product B reaction with Gilman reagent $(\mathrm(CH_3)_2\mathrm{CuLi})$ might proceed similarly:
$$
\mathrm{(CH_3)_2CuLi} \text{ attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide formed at C5-C6. Thus, the CH$_3$ group should primarily attack carbon atom number $\underline{5}$ because while carbon 6 has a methyl group (making carbon 6 a secondary carbon), carbon 5 is only substituted by the carbonyl group (making carbon 5 also secondary but less hindered than carbon 6 due to the carbonyl group being only a part of the main chain rather than an extra methyl group).}
$$
However, here carbon 5 is also part of an $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated ketone. Gilman reagents typically do conjugate addition on $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated ketones. However, once the epoxide is formed at C5-C6, the $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated ketone part is transformed such that conjugate addition might not apply here directly because the double bond is now part of an epoxide. 

Thus, the reaction mechanism should be:
1. Nucleophilic substitution (opening of the epoxide) from the less substituted carbon (less sterically hindered carbon atom).
2. After opening epoxides formed at C1-C2 or C5-C6, the product should be an alcohol formed where one carbon (from the epoxide) now has a CH3 group attached (from the Gilman reagent).

#### Let us write down what the reaction might look like explicitly:

The first reaction with MCPBA produces two epoxides approximately in a 1:1 ratio:

1. Compound where C1=C2 forms an epoxide (Product A):
$$
\mathrm{H_2C\underset{1}{\text{--}}CH - C(CH_3)_2 - CH_2 - C(=O) - CH=CH - CH_3} \rightarrow \overset{\text{MCPBA}}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{H_2C\underset{o}{\overset{\underset{1}{|}}{\text{--}}}CH - C(CH_3)_2 - CH_2 - C(=O) - CH=CH - CH_3}
$$
2. Compound where C5=C6 forms an epoxide (Product B):
$$
\mathrm{H_2C=CH - C(CH_3)_2 - CH_2 - C(=O) - CH=CH - CH_3} \rightarrow \overset{\text{MCPBA}}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{H_2C=CH - C(CH_3)_2 - CH_2 - C(=O) - CH\underset{o}{\overset{\underset{5}{|}}{\text{--}}}CH - CH_3}
$$

Possible reaction products when adding an excess of $(\mathrm{CH_3)_2CuLi}$:

For $\underline{\text{Product A}}$:
1. The $(\mathrm{CH_3})_2\mathrm{CuLi}$ reagent attacks the less substituted carbon of the epoxide ring (in this case carbon 1 because carbon 2 is more substituted):
$$
\mathrm{H_2C\underset{o}{\overset{\underset{1}{|}{\text{}}}{\text{--}}}CH - C(CH_3)_2 - CH_2 - C(=O) - CH=CH - CH_3} + (\mathrm{CH_3})_2\mathrm{CuLi} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH(OH) - C(CH_3)_2 - CH_2 - C(=O) - CH=CH - CH_3}
$$

Thus, the product where Gilman reagents open the epoxide formed on the C1=C2 bond could be:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3CH(OH)CH_2C(CH_3)_2-CH_2-C(=O)-CH=CH-CH_3}
$$

However, one should make sure that the structure makes sense after opening the epoxide and adding a methyl group to the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. This might need us to resolve the structure explicitly.

#### For $\underline{\text{Product B}}$:
1. The $(\mathrm{CH_3})_2\mathrm{CuLi}$ prefers to attack the less substituted carbon (which is whether carbon 5 or 6 should be determined based on steric hindrance, although sometimes the reaction prefers the less hindered carbon. Given that carbon 5 is connected to carbon 4 which contains a carbonyl group and carbon 6 is connected to a methyl group, both carbons appear to be secondary, but carbon 6 contains an additional methyl group making carbon 6 sterically hindered compared to carbon 5 which only connects to the ketone group and carbon 6).

However, an $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated ketone part still exists in Product A where the double bond is at C5=C6, so the close part where the methyl group should be added could be:
$$
\mathrm{H_2C=CH - C(CH_3)_2 - CH_2 - C(=O) - CH\underset{o}{\overset{\underset{5}{|}}{\text{--}}}CH - CH_3} + (\mathrm{CH_3})_2\mathrm{CuLi} \rightarrow \mathrm{H_2C=CH - C(CH_3)_2 - CH_2 - C(=O) -CH(OH)CH_2-CH_3}
$$
By opening Product B’s epoxide formed from the C5-C6 double bond:
$$
\mathrm{CH_2=CH - C(CH_3)_2 - CH_2 - C(=O) - CHCH_3CH_2\mathrm{OH}}
$$
However, the chemoselectivity here might make another reaction product plausible where the reaction might make a conjugate addition to the remaining carbonyl functionality if another double bond stays intact.

However, there might be a mistake here because the complete stereochemistry should be checked explicitly here. Another possible clean interpretation could be:
1. Opening an epoxide is a nucleophilic attack on the $\alpha$ carbon concerning the oxygen in the epoxide.
2 Methyl group is attached where the methyl group from Gilman reagent opens the epoxide.

However, we need to identify one specific product based on the reaction series described. 

Considering the nature of Gilman reagents interacting with epoxides, the opening of the epoxide should thus make:
$$
\mathrm{LiCH_2CH_2CH(CH_3)_2-CH_2-C(=O)-CH=CH-CH_3} \text{ (first product from reacting with C1-C2 epoxide)}.
$$
and open the epoxide on carbons 5 and 6:
$$
\mathrm{CH_2=CH-C(CH_3)_2-CH_2-C(=O)-CH_2-CH(OH)CH_3} \text{ (second product from reacting with C5-C6 epoxide.}
$$

To make a more explicit calculation of the second part where the carbonyl faces conjugate addition, normally:
$\mathrm{(CH_3)_2CuLi}$ is known to primarily undergo a 1,4-addition (conjugate addition) in $\alpha ,\beta$-unsaturated ketones where $\mathrm{CH_3}$ adds onto the $\beta$ carbon and the $\mathrm{Cu}$ part associates with the oxygen.

Based on this, another reaction could be a 1, 4 conjugate addition where the $\mathrm{CH_3}$ adds onto the $\beta$ carbon (conjugated double bond), although it might make our question enriched with products where:
1. For Product A (epoxide on C1-C2 double bond), there is still an $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated ketone part consisting of carbons 4,
