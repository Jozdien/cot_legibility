To solve for the total number of carbon atoms in product 3, we need to follow the reactions step by step.

1. The first reaction is the treatment of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), which is a Grignard reaction. 

   The structure of trans-cinnamaldehyde is:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-CHO}
$$
    
    When treated with methylmagnesium bromide (CH₃MgBr), which acts as a nucleophile by attacking the carbonyl carbon (C=O) group, after subsequent protonation upon aqueous workup, an alcohol is formed. The reaction can be visualized as follows:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-CHO + CH_3MgBr \rightarrow (C_6H_5-CH=CH-CHOMgBr)CH_3 \text{ (intermediate)}}
$$
Followed typically by an acid workup such as H₃O⁺, which protonates the oxygen atom connected to the magnesium bromide complex to form an alcohol:
$$
\mathrm{(C_6H_5-CH=CH-CHOMgBr)CH_3 \xrightarrow{H_3O^+} C_6H_5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH_3}
$$
So, product 1 should be:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH_3}
$$
    
2. The second reaction treats product 1 with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), which is an oxidizing agent that selectively oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes (and typically secondary alcohols to ketones).

    The structure of product 1 is $\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH_3}$. The alcohol group here is a secondary alcohol (since it is attached to a carbon that is also connected to another carbon atom and a hydrogen atom). Therefore, PCC should oxidize the secondary alcohol to a ketone:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-CH(OH)CH_3 \xrightarrow{PCC} C_6H_5-CH=CH-COCH_3}
$$
So, product 2 appears to be:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-COCH_3}
$$
    
3. The third reaction treats product 2 with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfanylidene)methane in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at elevated temperature.

    The compound "(dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfanylidene)methane" is another name for the "Corey–Chaykovsky reagent" which is dimethyl sulfoxonium methylide (also known as (Trimethylsulfoxonium Iodide)). However, it seems that "dimethyl sulfoxonium methylide" might be referred to here as a "dimethylsulfoxonium methylide," which is usually represented as $(CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2^-$, generated typically from a strong base like NaH reacting with trimethylsulfoxonium iodide. 

Given that the question uses a name that translates roughly to a "dimethyl sulfoxonium methylide" type of reagent, it is important to recall that a well-known reaction involving such reagents called the "Corey–Chaykovsky reaction" allows for the formation of epoxides from carbonyl groups (called epoxidation of a carbonyl substrate).

However, the most common reaction here is the reaction of a sulfonium ylide such as a dimethylsulfonium methylide ($(CH_3)_2S^{+}CH_2^{-}$) or a sulfoxonium ylide ($(CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2^{-}$), which is used for making epoxides from aldehydes and ketones where the —CH₂— group is added to the carbonyl carbon forming an epoxide. 

However, the question mentions specifically that "product 2" from step 2 is treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfanylidene)methane, which appears to be referring to another type of reaction called the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction where a methylene group adds to a carbonyl compound forming an epoxide known as an "epoxylation" process where $\ce{(CH3)2S(O)CHO}$ reacts with a ketone or aldehyde.

For example, given ketone:
$$
\mathrm{R_1R_2C=O + (CH_3)_2S^{+}CH_2^{-} \rightarrow R_1R_2C-CH_2 + (CH_3)_2S=O}
$$
But the key part here seems to be correctly interpreting the reaction described here which mentions a reaction that makes an epoxide from a carbonyl compound such as a ketone. However, the question statement needs us to identify the product structure formed specifically after treating product 2 (which is $\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-COCH_3}$) with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfanylidene)methane in DMSO at an elevated temperature. 

Problem needs us to identify how many carbon atoms are present in the final product (product 3). Let us analyze the reaction once again:

Product 2 is:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-COCH_3}
$$
This compound has a total of 10 carbon atoms (6 from the benzene ring plus four more carbons in the carbon chain where there is a double bond between the second and third carbon from the terminal aldehyde carbonyl group now converted into a keto group).

The reaction might be described as follows:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-COCH_3 + (CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2 \rightarrow \text{(product 3)}}
$$
However, to make sure that the reaction makes sense chemically, a well-known reaction that uses a similar type of sulfonium ylide is the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction where a sulfonium ylide or sulfoxonium ylide reacts with carbonyl compounds such as:
$$
\mathrm{R_2C=O + (CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2 \rightarrow R_2C-CH_2 + (CH_3)_2SO}
$$
However, the most known reaction with such ylides is the reaction where they act as a methylene transfer agent such that:
$$
\mathrm{R_2C=O + (CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2^- \rightarrow R_2C-CH_2 + (CH_3)_2S=O}
$$
But such methylene transfer agents usually make an epoxide from a ketone where the ylide attacks the carbonyl carbon and forms a three-membered ring (epoxide ring).

Thus, this reaction should be:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-COCH_3~\xrightarrow{\text{(CH}_3\text{)}_2\text{S(O)CH}_2^-~\text{(in DMSO, elevated temperature)}} \text{Product 3}}
$$
The reaction transforms product 2's ketone (C=O) into an epoxide where the carbonyl carbon becomes part of an epoxide structure where one carbon from the ylide adds to the carbonyl carbon such that:
$$
\text{C_6H_5-CH=CH-\underset{}{\overset{}{\underset{\displaystyle\quad O}{\underset{|}{\overset{\displaystyle ||}{\mathrm{C}}}-CH_3}}}}
\text{ is attacked by } (CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2^-, \text{ which leads to:}
$$
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-\underset{O}{\underset{|}{\overset{\displaystyle}{\mathrm{C}}}CH_2}-CH_3}
$$

Another part of the question is making sure that we identify the details correctly. Another important part here is that Corey–Chaykovsky reaction usually makes an epoxide ring when a ketone is reacted with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-COCH_3 + (CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2^- \rightarrow C_6H_5-CH=CH-C(\underset{\displaystyle}{\overset{\displaystyle}{\underset{|}{\displaystyle CH_3}}})\overset{\displaystyle O}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{CH_2}}}}
$$

Hence, the resulting product (product 3) after the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction should be:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-\underset{O}{\underset{|}{\overset{\displaystyle}{\mathrm{C}}}CH_2-CH_3}}
$$
But another name for such a structure could explicitly be:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-\underset{ }{\underset{|}{\overset{ }{\underset{}{\displaystyle C}(CH_3)}}\overset{\underset{|}{\displaystyle O}}{\underset{}{\mathrm{CH_2}}}}
}
$$
The product formed should be a substituted epoxide where the carbonyl group is converted to an epoxide ring where part of the initial ketone ($\ce{-COCH_3}$) gets converted to:
$$
\ce{CH_-\underset{O-CH2}{\underset{\displaystyle|}{C}}-\underset{CH_3}{\underset{\displaystyle|}{C}}}
$$
However, to make a more clear image, such a reaction might generate a structure such as:
$$
\ce{C6H5-CH=CH-\overset{CH3}{\underset{}{\overset{}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{C}}}}}CH2} \text{ (where an epoxide ring is formed where oxygen bridges the carbonyl carbon and the ylide's methylene group).}
$$
However, another part here is to make an epoxide ring such that:
$$
\mathrm{(C_6H_5-CH=CH)-COCH_3 + (CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2\rightarrow (C_6H_5-CH=CH)\underset{(CH_taining~a~{}3-membered~epoxide)}{\mathrm{-C(CH_3)}-\underset{\displaystyle O}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{CH_2}}}}}.
$$
However, in order to identify product 3 accurately, it is important to verify the total number of carbon atoms in the final product.

1. The Grignard reaction should add one methyl group (which has one carbon) to trans-cinnamaldehyde which has nine carbon atoms (6 from benzene and 3 in the chain including the aldehyde carbon).
    - Initial trans-cinnamaldehyde has nine carbon atoms in total (6 from benzene ring + 3 in the chain).

2. Methylmagnesium bromide adds one carbon (CH₃ from CH₃MgBr), so after reaction to form product 1:
$$
\text{(total carbons in trans-cinnamaldehyde: 9 carbons) + (1 carbon from CH₃MgBr)} = 10 \text{ carbons in product 1}
$$
    
3. For the second step, there seems to be no change in the total number of carbon atoms because PCC only oxidizes the alcohol group (-OH) to a keto group (-CO-), so the total number of carbon atoms should remain:
$$
10 \text{ carbons in product 1} \rightarrow 10 \text{ carbons in product 2}
$$
    
4. The reaction of product-processing "dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfanylidene)methane" should only make a reaction modification where the reaction involves transforming a ketone into an epoxide but should not affect the total carbon atoms significantly unless new carbon atoms are added.
    
After analyzing previous steps, product 2 has 10 carbon atoms already established. The reaction with (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfanylidene)methane in DMSO should not add any new carbon atoms because the "methane" part already refers to a $CH_2$ group which is a part of the ylide itself. Another carbon that is part of "(dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfanylidene)methane" is primarily used for creating a reaction product where part of the ylide "adds" methylene (CH₂) group to create a three-membered epoxide ring where the sulfur ylid part $(CH_3)_2S^{+}CH_2^{-}$ provides a $CH_2$ group which already was part of the ylide structure itself.

Hence, the question now is to determine if any new carbons are added in step 3 explicitly. However, what we need here is what "(dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfanylidene)methane" means. The chemical formula for (dimethyl(oxo)-λ⁶-sulfanylidene)methane is typically:
$$
(CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2,
$$
which means that the ylide $((CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2^-)$ should add only one methylene group (CH₂) to the ketone.

Another method that makes this reaction specific is a "Michael addition" might be done here where the double bond system might react with the ylide. However, it seems that the ketone group should primarily react here. 

However, typically, such a reagent only adds a $CH_2$ group if it reacts just as methylene transfer agent. Hence, if $CH_2$ is added:
$$
10 \text{ carbons in product 2} + (\text{methylene fragment might mean adding another carbon atom in general, so we need another carbon for the $CH_2$ bridge. However, upon making an epoxide ring, some part seems misleading because one carbon might be added as a bridge but is still accounted for in the reagent $CH_3_2S(O)CH_2}$, which contains three carbons in total.)
$$
However, let us count carbon atoms explicitly in the reaction.

The ketone in product 2 (compound $\ce{C6H5-CH=CH-CO-CH3}$) reacts with (dim~(oxo)~λ⁶-sulfane ~ ylidene)methane (which once again, is $(CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2$, where total carbon atoms are three carbon atoms: two in the $CH_3$ groups and one in the $Ymethylene$ $CH_нце of$-لf $(CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2^{-}$. However, the part of dimethyl sulfoxonium methylide $(CH_3)_2S(O)CH_2^{-}$ that really reacts is the $CH_2^{2-}$ part where it acts as a nucleophile attacking the carbonyl carbon atom forming a two-carbon and one-oxygen three-membered oxidized cyclic structure (ep). Therefore, essentially, our product 3 should still maintain the same carbon count unless the part $CH_2^2-$ gets added specifically.

However, let us recollect what the fundamental parts are:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5} \text{ (6 carbon atoms)}
$$
$$
\mathrm{-CH=CH-} \text{ (2 carbon atoms)}
$$
$$
\mathrm{-COCH_3} \text{ (2 atoms including the carbonyl)}
}$$
Total carbon atoms in product 2 is thus $6 + 2 + 2 = 10$ carbon atoms.

The specific reagent used in the reaction seems to only add a $CH_2$ group making:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-C(CH_3)-CH_2}
$$
However, by forming something akin to an epoxide ring from a carbonyl group, the frame ends up being:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_5-CH=CH-\underset{CH_3}{\underset{|}{\mathrm{C}}}- CH_2}
$$
However exhaustive count:
$$
\text{C_6H_5-CH=Acta-CH_2 + Cfrombenzeneyas}_6 + 2 \text{carbons in $CH=CH$:+_ xzone}._3 = 10 + 1 (\text{t IF the $CH_2}$ group is indeed added樊新})
$$
