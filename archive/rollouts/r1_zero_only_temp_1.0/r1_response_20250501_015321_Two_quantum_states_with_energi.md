To resolve two energy levels with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ such that their lifetimes are $\tau_1 = 10^{-9}$ seconds and $\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ seconds, the energy uncertainty (often referred to as the "linewidth" of the energy states) plays a crucial role.

The energy-time uncertainty relation is given by:
$$
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
$$
where $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$ is the reduced Planck's constant (note that $\hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{Js}$). Another common way to express this relation is:
$$
\Delta E \cdot \tau \approx \hbar,
$$
where $\tau$ is interpreted as the lifetime of the state whose energy uncertainty is $\Delta E$.

However, a more rigorous way to express the "energy-time uncertainty relation" might be:
$$
\Gamma\tau = \hbar,
$$
where $\Gamma$ (often denoted as $\Delta E$) is the natural linewidth of the energy level (which is the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Lorentzian line shape of the transition), and $\tau$ is the lifetime of an excited state. This leads us to the relation $\Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}$.

Thus, for the given states:
$$
\Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} \text{ and } \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
$$
However, what we need to identify here is the total linewidth which represents the "combined" linewidth if two energy levels are involved in a transition where one state has a lifetime $\tau_1$ and the other has a lifetime $\tau_2$. For a transition between two states with lifetimes $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$, the total linewidth $\Gamma_{\text{total}}$ can be approximated as the sum of the individual linewidths $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$:
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} + \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \hbar \left( \frac{1}{\tau_1} + \frac{1}{\tau_2} \right).
$$
Since the question states that lifetimes $\tau_1 = $10$^{-9}$ s for state 1 and $\tau_2 = 10^{-8}$ s for state 2, let us substitute these values:
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} = \hbar \left(\frac{1}{10^{-9}} + \frac{1}{10^{-8}}\right) = \hbar \left(10^9 + 10^8\right) \, \text{s}^{-1} = \hbar \times 10^9 \times (1 + 0.1) = 1.1 \times 10^9 \hbar.
$$
Calculating the constant $\hbar$, which is approximately $1.05 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}$ (or $6.582 \times 10^{-16} \text{ eV·s}$):
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} \approx 1.1 \times 10^9 \times 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J} \tag{using $\hbar$ in J·s},
$$
so:
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} \text{ (in Joules)} \approx 1.1 \times 10^9 \times 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J} = 1.16 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J}.
$$
To convert this to electronvolts (eV) (since $1 \text{ J} = \frac{1}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \text{ eV}$):
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} = 1.16 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J} \times \frac{1}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \text{ eV/J} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}.
$$
Alternatively, directly calculating linewidth in eV units using $\hbar$ in eV·s:
$$
\hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \text{ eV·s}.
$$
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} \text{ (in eV)} = 1.1 \times 10^9 \times 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \text{ eV} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}.
$$

To resolve two energy levels with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$, the energy difference $|E_1 - E_2|$ should be larger than the total linewidth of the levels involved in the transition. Conversely, if the energy difference is smaller than the total linewidth, the two energy levels cannot be clearly resolved because their energy uncertainties cause their line shapes to overlap significantly.

Thus, the question requires us to identify which of the given energy differences makes it clear that $E_1$ and $E_2$ could be resolved. The linewidth here is approximately $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$. Hence, any energy difference that is significantly greater than $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ makes it feasible to resolve both states. To make a "clear" distinction, the energy difference should be much larger than the total linewidth. However, what "significantly greater" means here should be analyzed through the provided options:
1. $10 eV$
2. $7 \times 10^{-8} eV$
3. $10^{-5} eV$
4. $10 MeV$
5. $7 \times 10^{-7} eV$

The order of magnitude for the total linewidth computed is $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV} \approx 7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$. From the provided options:

#### Analyzing the Choices:
1. $10 \text{ eV}$:
   - Significantly greater than our calculated total linewidth of $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$.
2. $7 \times 10^{-8} \text{ eV}$:
   - This is one order of magnitude smaller than our computed linewidth $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ (since $7 \times 10^{-8} \text{ eV} < 7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$), so the levels might not be resolved clearly if the energy difference is smaller than the linewidth.
3. $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$:
   - $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ is $14.1$ times greater than $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ (since $10^{-5} \text{ eV} = 10 \times 10^(-6) \text{ eV}$ and $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV} = 0.7 \times 10^{-6} \text{ eV}$), thus $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ appears to be sufficiently greater than our linewidth such that one could resolve the two energy states distinctly.
4. $10 \text{ MeV}$:
   - $10 \text{ MeV} = 10^7 \text{ eV}$ is very much greater than $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$, so $10 \text{ MeV}$ makes it very easy to resolve.
5. $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$:
   - This is approximately equal to our computed total linewidth of $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$. An energy difference equal to the total linewidth itself might make it hard to clearly resolve the two energy levels. 

To make a "clear" distinction, the energy difference should ideally be much larger than the total linewidth. Choices such as $10 \text{ eV}$ or $10\text{ MeV}$ are much larger than the linewidth thus making it easy to resolve the two energy states. However, from a physical point of view, "clearly resolving" two peaks requires that their central frequencies should be separated by at least the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peaks. However, a more common standard for resolution might require the energy difference to be several times larger than the linewidth.

However, the answer should ideally be greater than $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$. However, the answer should make a "clear" distinction. Options such as $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$ seem barely enough and thus might not make a "clear" separation. Thus, the question seems to be aiming for the first option that makes a clear distinction should be significantly larger than our computed linewidth of $7\times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$.

Based on this reasoning, an acceptable answer should be an energy difference which is significantly greater than $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$. Thus, $10 \text{ eV}$ or $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ appear to be good candidates for a "clear" resolution since both are significantly larger than $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$, but $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ seems to be a more "reasonable" scale for such a question compared to $10 \text{ eV}$ or $10 \text{ MeV}$, which are orders of magnitude larger yet legitimate.

However, usually, "clearly resolved" usually means being several times larger compared to the line widths. However, $ 10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ might be a reasonable answer here because:
$$10^{-5} \text{ eV} \approx 14.14 \cdot (7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV})$$
However, $ 7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ seems too close to the computed linewidth itself such that:
$$7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV} \text{ (almost equal)}$$

However, based on a typical "rule of thumb," an energy difference should be a few times the linewidth. Thus, any option significantly larger than $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ should be sufficient. However, $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ is still far enough from $10 \, \text{MeV}$, which seems too large to make a comparison relevant at the atomic scale where energy differences are usually small. Thus, $10 \, \text{eV}$ seems feasible yet still a bit large for quantum states unless they are highly excited states such as in atoms like Rydberg states where such large energy differences could arise.

However, for a more "realistic" answer, $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ seems like a valid answer that represents a significant enough energy difference compared to the line widths while being a more realistic energy difference for describing atomic transitions compared to $10 \text{ eV}$ (which is still valid but a bit large for many atomic transitions) or $10 \text{ MeV}$ which is a gigantic energy difference typically found in nuclear physics rather than quantum states of atoms.

However, a more "common" measure used here might be an energy difference $dE$ such that:
$$
dE > \Gamma_{\text{total}}.
$$
So, let's check options again according to linewidth (which is $7.2403\text{ (approximately } \hbar \times {1.1\times10^9}\text{)}$)
Only $7 \times 10^{-8} \text{ eV}$ is smaller than the linewidth found $7.24 \times1^\cdot 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$. However, answers such as $E_2 - E_1 \approx 7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ appear almost equal to the linewidth which might make resolution difficult. 

So, the only options that make a very "clear" resolution based on a linewidth of $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ are $10^{-5}~\text{eV},\ 10~\text{eV},\ \text{and}\;10~\text{MeV}$. 

However, "clearly resolved" may mean that the energy difference should be greater than the total spectral linewidth which is about $10^{-6} \text{ eV}$ order of magnitude. Thus, $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ seems like a reasonable answer here where $10 \text{ eV}$ seems a bit large but still valid. However, $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ fits better here.

However, another way to check is by using the Heisenberg uncertainty relation directly in frequency units. The full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) for frequencies is given by $\Delta \nu = \frac{1}{2\pi\tau}$ where $\tau$ is the lifetime. Considering the broadened frequencies:
$$
\Delta \nu_1 = \frac{1}{2\pi\tau_1} = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 10^{-9}} \text{ Hz} \approx $1.59 \times 10^{8} \text{ Hz}$,
$$
$$
\Delta \nu_2 = \frac{1}{2\pi\tau_2} = \frac{1}{2\pi \times 10^{-8}} \text{ Hz} \approx 1.59 \times 10^{7} \text{ Hz}.
$$
Total width might be estimated as:
$$
\Delta \nu_{\text{total}} \approx 1.59 \times 10^{8} \text{ Hz} + 1.59 \times 10^{7} \text{ Hz} \approx (1.59 + 0.159) \times 10^{}s8 \text{ Hz} \approx1.75 \times 10^{8} \text{ Hz}.
$$
Using $E = h\nu$ where $h = 4.136 \times 10^{-15} \text{ eV·s}$:
$$
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = h \Delta \nu_{\text{total}} = (4.136 \times 10^{-15}) \times 1.75 \times 10^8 \text{ eV} \approx 7.38 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}.
$$
Based on this, any energy difference given should be larger than $7.38 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ for a viable resolution. 

However, the rule of thumb for "good" spectroscopic resolvability requires that the energy difference should be much larger than the linewidth itself. Hence:
1. $10 \text{ eV}$ is thus $10^7$ times larger than linewidth.
2. $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ is $10\sqrt{2}$ times larger than linewidth.
3. $10 \text{ MeV}$ is $10^{}$13 times larger than linewidth.
Thus, any option like $10 \text{-5} eV$, $10 \text{eV}$ or $10 \text{ MeV}$ could be viable options here.

However, what might make $10 \text{ eV}$ or $10 \text{ MeV}$ less realistic here is that such values are too large physically for a normal atomic or molecular transition. A more "realistic" difference might be $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ which translates to a frequency of:
$$
\nu = \frac{10^{-5} \text{ eV}}{h} = \frac{10^{-5}}{4.136 \times 10^{-15}} \text{ Hz} \approx 2.42 \times 10^{9} \text{ Hz} \text{ (or several GHz which is reasonable for atomic scales)}
$$
Meanwhile, $10 \text{ eV}$ corresponds to:
$$
\nu = \frac{10}{4.136 \times 10^{-15}} \text{ Hz} \approx 2.42 \times 10^{15} \text{ Hz} \text{ (visible to ultraviolet range)}
$$
And $10 \text{ MeV}$ corresponds to gamma rays which seems unreasonably high for a quantum state transition.

Based on the given choices $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ seems a reasonable and likely answer where $10 \text{ eV}$ could be a bit high but still valid. However, the question is "which one of the following options COULD be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." Both $10 \textrm{ eV}$ and $10^{-5} \textrm{ eV}$ seem like viable candidates where $10 \textrm{ MeV}$ seems a bit too excessive.

However, $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ appears to be a possible answer which makes logical sense because it is significantly larger than the calculated linewidth yet within a reasonable order of magnitude for atomic or molecular energy differences. An energy difference of $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ is already close to the linewidth itself thus making it difficult to resolve.

Thus, any answer much bigger than $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ should be valid such that:
- $10\text{ eV}$ fits the bill perfectly but appears a bit too high.
- $7 \times 10^{-8} \text{ eV}$ is too small.
- $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ seems reasonable.
- $10 \text{ MeV}$ seems too high.
- $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ seems too close to linewidth.

However, all three answers $10\text{ eV}$, $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$, and $10 \text{ MeV}$ should technically make the levels resolvable. However, $10 ^\text{MeV}$ is generally unphysical for quantum states outside nuclear physics contexts.

Hence, an answer that makes sense practically would indeed be:
$$
10^{-5} \text{ eV} \quad \text{seems reasonable for atomic scales}.
$$

However, $10 \text{ eV}$ also makes them clearly resolvable. By the same reasoning:
$$
\Delta E = 10\text{ eV} \gg 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}.
$$
Hence, options $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$, $10 \text{ eV}$, and $10 \text{ MeV}$ make the two energy levels clearly resolvable based on the question's wording. However, $10^{-5} \text{ eV}$ appears most realistic for atomic transitions.

Thus, $10^{-5}\text{ eV}$ seems to be an answer that makes sense here among choices such as:
1. $10 \text{ eV}$ (also valid but quite large).
