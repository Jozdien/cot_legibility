To reason through how Maxwell's equations would need to be adjusted in a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole, we need to first recall the usual form of Maxwell's equations used in our universe where isolated magnetic monopoles are not known to exist. 

Maxwell's equations in differential form are as follows:

1. Gauss's law for electricity:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0},
$$
where $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $\rho$ is the electric charge density, and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

2. Gauss's law for magnetism:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0,
$$
where $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field. This equation states that there are no magnetic monopoles—i.e., no isolated North or South poles.

3. Faraday's law of induction:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t},
$$
which describes how a time-varying magnetic field generates an electric field.

4. Ampère-Maxwell law:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J} + \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}{\partial t}},
$$
where $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density (representing the flow of electric charges) and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.

To generalize what effect the existence of magnetic monopoles would have on Maxwell's equations, let us denote the magnetic charge density by $\rho_m$ (which would be analogous to the electric charge density $\rho$) and the magnetic current density by $\mathbf{J_m}$ (which would be analogous to the electric current density $\mathbf{J}$).

#### Modifying Maxwell's equations for magnetic monopoles:

1. **Gauss's law for electricity should remain unchanged**, as there is no reason to believe that the existence of magnetic monopoles would affect Gauss's law for electric charges:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}.
$$
2. **Gauss's law for magnetism should be altered** because it states that magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero (i.e., $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$), which implies no magnetic monopoles. However, if isolated north or south magnetic poles (magnetic monopoles) exist, this equation should resemble Gauss's law for electricity such that:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m,
$$
where $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density. Notice that here, the permeability of free space $\mu_0$ appears on the right-hand side for symmetry reasons such that the units for magnetic charge are defined consistently with electric charge.
    
However, some physicists prefer a different notation where the constant might be adapted such that:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m,
$$
where $\rho_m$ represents magnetic charge density such that if one wants to make the units explicitly symmetric (which makes the parallel between electric and magnetic charges more apparent), a unit conversion constant might be defined such that:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \alpha \rho_m,
$$
for some constant $\alpha$. However, a commonly symmetric form is written as:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m.
$$
Alternatively, some formulations define a magnetic charge $g$ such that:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 4 \pi \rho_m,
$$
if using Gaussian units where $4 \pi\rho_m$ represents the magnetic charge density. However, the most common SI unit formulation often uses:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m.
$$
Another convention is:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m \ (\text{if defined properly and units are adjusted appropriately}).
$$

3. **Faraday's law of induction should also be modified** because a magnetic current $\mathbf{J_m}$ (due to moving magnetic monopoles) would produce an additional term that represents a "magnetic current" affecting the electric field. Thus, Faraday’s law might be extended to:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \mathbf{J_m},
$$
where $\mathbf{J_m}$ is the magnetic current density analogous to the electric current density $\mathbf{J}$.
    
Another commonly symmetric form would be:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J_m} - \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}.
$$

4. **Ampère-Maxwell law should likely stay the same in the sense that it describes how electric current and a changing electric field generate a magnetic field. However, the question here seems to primarily focus on the presence of magnetic monopoles, which should directly affect the form of Ampère's law only if we interpret "equivalent symmetry" strictly. However, a strictly symmetric form should not need any additional terms related to magnetic currents here because Ampère-Maxwell law already contains electric current sources. Yet conventionally, once magnetic monopoles are introduced, it makes sense to maintain a symmetric structure such that:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}.
$$
However, for perfect symmetry between electric and magnetic fields, there shouldn't be any additional changes here. 

Based on the most prevalent handling of magnetic monopoles in theoretical physics, the main equations that need to be changed are 

**Gauss’s law for magnetism should be changed from**
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0,
$$
**to something like:**
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\rho_m.
$$
where $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density. 

**Faraday’s law should be changed from**
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t},
$$
**to something like:**
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J_m} - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t},
$$
where $\mathbf{J_m}$ is the magnetic current density (which only makes sense if magnetic monopoles can move such that there is a "magnetic current" when magnetic monopoles move).

However, the question seems to ask specifically which of Maxwell's equations should be different when magnetic monopoles exist. The most critical and necessary modification is:

**Modified Gauss’s law for magnetism:**
$$
\nabla \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m,
$$
Where previously zero magnetic monopoles meant $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$.

The next modification needed here is typically Faraday's law which should include a term for magnetic currents:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J_m} - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}.
$$

Overall, the two equations that change are Gauss’s law for magnetism (from $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$ to $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\rho_m$) and Faraday’s law of induction (from $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$ to $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0\mathbf{J_m} - \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$).

Hence, the answer mentions that the two equations that are different should be:
1. Gauss's law for magnetism: $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0 \rightarrow \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\rho_m$ (or a similar form including magnetic charge density).
2. Faraday's law of induction: $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \rightarrow \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0\mathbf{J_m} - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$.

Thus, the answer can be summarized succinctly as:
The equations that would be different are Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law of induction. However, the question asks specifically which equations need to change if magnetic monopoles are allowed:

1. **Gauss's law for magnetism**, which currently states that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$, needs modification because it implies that magnetic monopoles do not exist. So it should be replaced by an analogous equation such as $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m$, where $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density.

2. **Faraday’s law**, which currently states that $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$, should also be modified to account for any "magnetic currents" if magnetic charges can move (which makes $\mathbf{J_m}$ necessary), leading to a term such as $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0\mathbf{J_m} - \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$.

Thus **both** Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law are adjusted if magnetic monopoles exist. However, the key point is that Gauss’s law for magnetism would definitely need a term for magnetic charge density if magnetic monopoles exist ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\rho_m$) and Faraday's law requires a term for magnetic current ($\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mathbf{J_m} - \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$).

Based on this reason, the question about which specific equations need modifications can be answered as follows:
**Modified equations should be Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law of induction.**

However, a more symmetric set of Maxwell's equations including magnetic monopoles might be summarized as follows:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}, \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m, \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J_m} - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}, \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J_e} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}.
$$
This makes more explicit symmetry between electric and magnetic phenomena when monopoles are assumed.

However, a well-known form for Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles uses magnetic charge density $\rho_m$. Another well-known alternative form could directly make symmetries explicit where:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho_e / \epsilon_0, \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} - \mu_0\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} = \mu_0\mathbf{J_e}, \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \rho_m / \epsilon_0, \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = - \mu_0 \mathbf{J_m}.
$$
However, such a question often gets answered based on a well-known "symmetrized" form that makes analogies between electric charges and magnetic charges explicit. 

However, in a real-world physics context where magnetic monopoles are not observed, Maxwell's conventional equations hold as initially described. Thus, the main equations that need modification should be identified correctly as:
1. Gauss's law for magnetism needs to incorporate a term for magnetic charge density such that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} \neq 0$, so it should be something like:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m.
$$
2. Faraday’s law should incorporate a magnetic current term such it should be something like:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J_m} - \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}.
$$

Thus, the answer is that Gauss's law for magnetism and Faraday's law would be different in a universe where isolated magnetic monopoles exist.
However, another important analysis should verify that the modified Gauss's law for magnetism should indeed be the first one that needs an update. 

However, a more symmetric set of Maxwell’s equations looks like:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}, \tag{1 unchanged} \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m, \tag{2 changed $0$ becomes $\mu_0 \rho_m$} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J_m} - \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}, \tag{3 changed "added $- \mu_0 \mathbf{J_m}$"} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0(\mathbf{J_e} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}). \tag{4 unchanged}
$$

Thus, the answer follows that two main Maxwell equations need to be updated if magnetic monopoles exist: Gauss’s law for magnetism and Faraday’s law.
However technically, Faraday’s law needs a new magnetic current term only if magnetic charges move (hence producing a magnetic current), while Gauss’s law for magnetism definitely needs an update if magnetic charges exist even if they remain static.
