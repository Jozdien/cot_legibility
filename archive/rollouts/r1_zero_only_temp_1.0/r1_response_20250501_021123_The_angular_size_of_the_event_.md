To solve for the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole given that its angular size is $ \theta = 10^{-17}$ degrees and it is at a distance of $d = 10^{10}$ parsecs, let's start by interpreting what the angular size of the event horizon means.

The angular size $\theta$ is given in degrees so we need to convert it to radians:
$$
\theta = 10^{-17} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \text{ radians}.
$$
Using the fact that a full circle is $2\pi$ radians or $360 \text{ degrees}$:
$$
\frac{\pi}{180} \approx 0.01745,
$$
therefore:
$$
\theta = 10^{-17} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \text{ radians} \approx 10^{-17} \times 1.745 \times 10^{-2} = 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \text{ radians}.
$$
For order of magnitude calculations, it might be sufficient to approximate:
$$
\theta \approx 10^{-19} \text{ radians} \times 1.745,
$$
which is roughly $1.745 \times 10^{-19}~\text{radians}$. However, it makes sense to keep the full expression until the final calculation.

The angular size $\theta$ of an object with actual physical size $D$ (in this case, the diameter of the event horizon of the black hole) observed from a distance $d$ is given by:
$$
\theta \approx \frac{D}{d}.
$$
This approximation is valid for small angles where $\sin \theta \approx \theta$. Given that $d = 10^{10}$ parsecs, we need to convert parsecs to a consistent unit like meters. Since $1$ parsec $\approx 3.086 \times 10^{16}$ meters:
$$
d = 10^{10} \text{ parsecs} \times 3.086 \times 10^{16} \text{ meters/parsec} = 3.086 \times 10^{26} \text{ meters}.
$$
Using the angular size relation:
$$
\theta = \frac{D}{d}.
$$
Thus,
$$
D = d \cdot \theta.
$$
Given that:
$$
D = (3.086 \times 10^{26} \text{ meters}) \times (1.745 \times 10^{-19}).
$$
Calculating $D$:
$$
D \approx 3.086 \times 10^{26} \times 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \approx 5.385 \times 10^7 \text{ meters}.
$$
But we need to round this for order of magnitude:
$$
5.385 \times 10^7 \text{ meters} \sim 10^7 \times 5.4 \approx 5.4 \times 10^7 \text{ meters}.
$$
However, for order of magnitude, rounding coefficients close to $10^{0.5} \approx 3.16$ is usually interpreted as about an order of $10^0 \approx1$. Since $5.4$ is closer to $1$ than $10$, rounding $5.4 \times 10^7$ to an order of magnitude is still $10^8$ (rounding $5.4 \times 10^7$ is actually closer to $10^8$ in order of magnitude terms, but $5.4 \times 10^7$ should be interpreted correctly here as order of $10^7$ approximately). However, here we need the radius $R_s$. Thus:
$$
R_s = \frac{D}{2} \approx \frac{5.385 \times 10^7 \text{ meters}}{2} \approx 2.6925 \times 10^7 \text{ meters},
$$
which again is on the order of $10^7$ meter for the Schwarzschild radius ($R_s$).

However, the goal is to find the entropy of a black hole with such a Schwarzschild radius. Recall that the Schwarzschild radius $R_s$ for a black hole is given by:
$$
R_s = \frac{2 G M}{c^2}.
$$
This describes the same physical size $D$. Note that here $D \approx 2R_s$, so let us solve for the mass $M$ from $R_s \approx 2.7 \times 10^7$ meters (rounding terms appropriately for order of magnitude):
$$
M = \frac{R_s c^2}{2 G}.
$$
Where $G$ is the gravitational constant:
$$
G \approx 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ } \text{m}^3 \text{ kg}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-2},
$$
and $c$ is the speed of light:
$$
c \approx 3 \times 10^8~\text{m/s}.
$$
Thus:
$$
M \approx \frac{2.6925 \times 10^7 \text{ meters} \times (3 \times 10^8 \text{m/s})^2}{2 \times 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{m}^3\text{ kg}^{-1}\text{ s}^{-2}}.
$$
Calculating the numerator first:
$$
(3 \times $10^8)^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} \text{ m}^2/\text{s}^2,
$$
so:
$$
2.6925 \times 10^7 \times 9 \times 10^{16} = 2.6925 \times 9 \times 10^{23} \approx 24.2325 \times 10^{23} \text{ meters} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
$$
This makes the total calculation:
$$
M = \frac{24.2325 \times 10^{23}}{2 \times 6.67 \times 10^{-11}} \approx \frac{24.2325 \times 10^{23}}{13.34 \times 10^{-11}}.
$$
Calculating the division:
$$
M \approx \frac{24.2325 \times 10^{23}}{1.334 \times 10^{-10}} \approx (1.8165...) \times 10^{34} \text{ kg}.
$$
However, if we need the order of magnitude for calculations, one might round $24.2325 \approx\times 10^1$, so:
$$
24.2325 \times 10^{23} \approx 2.4 \times 10^{24} \text{ (meters} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2) \text{ (i.e., } 24.2325\text{ rounded)} \\
\frac{2.4 \times 10^{24}}{1.334 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.8 \times 10^{34}.
$$
For order of magnitude:
$$
M \sim 10^{34} \text{ kg}.
$$
However, it seems appropriate to double-check whether all the units make sense here. 

The next part requires calculating the entropy $S$ of a black hole. The formula for the entropy $S$ of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:
$$
S = \frac{k_B A}{4 \ell_{\text{P}}^2},
$$
where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $A$ is the area of the event horizon, and $\ell_{\text{P}}$ is the Planck length defined as:
$$
\ell_{\text{P}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}.
$$
Another way to express the entropy is through:
$$
S = \frac{A}{4} \left(\frac{k_B c^3}{\hbar G}\right) = \frac{k_B A c^3}{4 \hbar G}.
$$
Another commonly used form is:
$$
S = \frac{A}{4} \cdot \frac{k_B}{l_{\text{P}}^2}.
$$
Where $A$ here is the area of the event horizon:
$$
A = 4\pi R_s^2,
$$
and $S = \frac{k_B A}{4 \ell_{\text{P}}^2}$:
$$
\ell_{\text{P}}^2 = \frac{\hbar G}{c^3}.
$$
However, the usual formula one frequently encounters for the black hole entropy is:
$$
S = \frac{k_B c^3 A}{4\hbar G},
$$
which is directly derived from:
$$
S = \frac{A k_B}{4 \ell_{\text{P}}^2} \text{.}
$$
However, let us recall $k_B$, $\hbar$, $c$, and $G$ constants explicitly:
$$
k_B = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J/K},\\
\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s},\\
c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s},\\
G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}^3 \text{ kg}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-2}.
$$
However, an alternate form which directly uses the area $A$ and the Planck area is:
$$
S = \frac{k_B A}{4 L_{\text{P}}^2} = \frac{k_B \times 4 \pi R_s^2}{4 L_{\text{P}}^2} = \frac{\pi k_B R_s^2}{L_{\text{P}}^2},
$$
where $L_{\text{P}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}$. Another well-known representation for the Bekenstein-Hawking formula is:
$$
S = \frac{A}{4} \text{ in units where } k_B = 1, c = 1, \hbar = 1, \text{ and } G = 1.
$$
So given that:
$$
A = 4\pi R_s^2,
$$
where $R_s$ is the previously calculated Schwarzschild radius:
$$
A = 4\pi (2.7 \times 10^7)^2
