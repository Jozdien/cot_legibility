To solve higher-dimensional heat equations using finite approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function can be approximated by a fractional approximation such as the "parallel fractional approximation" (specifically referred to as a "product splitting scheme" or "operator splitting method").

The matrix exponential arises naturally from solving differential equations such as the heat equation. For a given matrix $A$, the matrix exponential $e^{A}$ is defined as:
$$
e^A = I + A + \frac{A^2}{2!} + \frac{A^3}{3!} + \cdots.
$$
However, for solving partial differential equations such as the heat equation:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \Delta u,
$$
where $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator (which could be discretized into a matrix representing the finite difference approximations), an operator splitting method is often used.

For instance, in a three-dimensional case where the Laplacian can be split:
$$
\Delta u = \Delta_x u + \Delta_y u + \Delta_z u,
$$
the matrix corresponding to the discretized Laplacian could be decomposed into three matrices $A_x$, $A_y$, and $A_z$ such that:
$$
A = A_x + A_y + A_z,
$$
where $A_x$, $A_y$, and $A_z$ correspond to the second-order derivative approximations in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively.

The matrix exponential $e^{\tau A}$ (where $\tau$ represents a time step $\Delta t$) can be used to evolve the solution from $u(t)$ to $u(t+\tau)$:
$$
u(t+\tau) = e^{\tau A}u(t).
$$
However, directly calculating $e^{\tau (A_x + A_y + A_z})$ might be computationally expensive. An approximation such as a fractional approximation can be used here. One well-known fractional splitting scheme is the first-order Lie-Trotter splitting:
$$
e^{\tau (A_x + A_y + A_z)} \approx e^{\tau A_x} e^{\tau A_y} e^{\tau A_z}.
$$
However, a more symmetric split such as Strang splitting might yield a second-order approximation:
$$
e^{\tau(A_x + A_y + A_z)} \approx e^{\frac{\tau}{2} A_x} e^{\frac{\tau}{2} A_y} e^{\tau A_z} e^{\frac{\tau}{2} A_y} e^{\frac{\tau}{2} A_x}.
$$
Such splitting schemes make it tractable to solve the higher-dimensional heat equation iteratively by sequentially solving one-dimensional problems such as $e^{\tau A_x}$, $e^{\tau A_y}$, and $e^{\tau A_z}$.

#### Converting Sequential Algorithms into Parallel Algorithms through Fractional Approximations

The key factor here is that the fractional approximation such as $e^{\tau A} \approx e^{\tau A_x} e^{\tau A_y} e^{\tau A_z}$ allows you to solve the one-dimensional problems separately. However, a more parallelizable splitting might be something like:
$$
e^{\tau (A_x + A_y + A_z)} = e^{\tau A_x} e^{\tau A_y} e^{\tau A_z}.
$$
However, a truly parallel variant here could be that once $e^{\tau A_x}$ is independent of $y$ and $z$, computations for $e^{\tau A_x}u$ can be carried out independently along each $x$-line (i.e., for fixed $y$ and $z$ values). Similarly, $e^{\tau A_y}$ can be solved along $y$-lines independently for fixed $x$ and $z$. Lastly, $e^{\tau A_z}$ operations can be parallelized along $z$-lines for fixed $x$ and $y$.

However, a more parallelizable fractional approximation might be one that allows us to solve for $e^{\tau A_x}$, $e^{\tau A_y}$, and $e^{\tau A_z}$ simultaneously if independent processors can handle different directions simultaneously until the final product needs to be aggregated together. 

Another potential parallel splitting scheme might be:
$$
e^{\tau (A_x + A_y + A_z)} \approx (I - \tau A_x)^{-1} (I - \tau A_y)^{-1} (I - \tau A_z)^{-1}.
$$
Such a scheme could make it possible to solve $ (I - \tau A_x)u^{n+1}_x = u^n$, $(I - \tau A_y)u^{n+1}_y = u^{n+1}_x$, and $(I - \tau A_z)u^{n+1} = u^{n+1}_y$ in a more parallel-friendly implicit method for each time step.

However, another crucial part of parallel splitting algorithms often involves the use of "domain decomposition," where the spatial domain is decomposed into smaller subdomains where each subdomain is handled by a different processor. 

Thus, the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel algorithm in this context is the "operator splitting" or "fractional splitting" of the matrix exponential such that the resulting sub-problems (usually one-dimensional problems such as $A_x$, $A_y$, $A_z$) can be solved independently and simultaneously on parallel processors. Another key part is the "domain decomposition" itself which makes it feasible to solve the decomposed sub-problems in parallel and aggregate the results for the final solution.

### Conclusion
Based on this reasoning, a valid summary could emphasize that the "key factor" is the "fractional approximation" of the matrix exponential. However, a more specific term might be "operator splitting methods" which make it possible to solve independently for each dimension and leverage parallel computing effectively.

Hence, a well-defined reasoning leads us to:
Answer: "While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation. The key factor of converting sequential algorithm into parallel algorithm is the application of fractional splitting methods such as operator splitting or domain decomposition methods."

However, a precise term you should fill in the blank here based on the given question statement might indeed be just "fractional approximation," but a fitting answer could explicitly mention "parallel fractional approximation" or "parallel splitting." Another well-known fractional splitting method is named after Trotter or splitting methods like "Strang splitting."

Based on a more structured answer:
Answer should be "Operator Splitting" or "Fractional Splitting" which makes parallel processing possible. However, what makes the most sense contextually here is usually phrased as:
Answer: **operator splitting** methods for matrix exponentials such as $e^{A} \approx e^{A_x} \cdot e^{A_y} \cdot e^{A_z}$ which makes parallel computing feasible.

However, the question seems to ask for a "key factor" such that "fractional approximation" is already given in the question statement as part of the process description. Another part of the problem description is "parallel splitting." Another possible answer could be "data decomposition" or "domain decomposition," although it sounds like the question directly asks what makes the "parallel splitting" possible. 

However, the question statement already covers part of the answer where it states that the "matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation." Another part should explicitly define something that makes the "parallel splitting" effective such as:
Thus, the most likely answer could be:

Answer: **parallel splitting**

However, it seems that such a question might be a standard part of a numerical methods textbook where "parallel splitting" itself seems to be the part that makes the algorithm parallel. Another terminology which sounds well-known here is "parallel splitting based on fractional approximations." 

However, what makes the question make more sense might involve where "parallel splitting" itself is used for processing dimensions independently. Hence after a deeper check, a more standard answer might rely on other terminologies like "Parallel splitting" could be indeed a key factor here.

Based on the question context, it seems that "parallel splitting" is already mentioned explicitly in the question itself where "key factor" should be a specific action or a method used in parallel splitting itself such like "fractional step method" or "alternating direction implicit (ADI) method" which is quite common in solving higher dimensional heat equations.

Finally, one common term that fits well here is "alternating direction implicit (ADI) method," which splits multi-dimensional problems into one-dimensional problems that can be solved sequentially. However, ADI is usually for implicit schemes which makes it a sequential implicitly solved algorithm. Another related splitting method called Peaceman-Rachford ADI might be a second-order accurate splitting suitable although it is typically used for 2D problems.

Thus, what sounds like a general well-known term here might indeed be "Split operator techniques" or sometimed referred to as "Method of fractional steps"

Thus, a refined answer could be:
Answer: "Method of fractional steps" or "**Operator splitting**" should be the key factor for solving higher dimensional heat equations allowing parallel computations via higher order finite difference approximations.

Looking again at standard conventions for such numerical methods, a widely used parallel splitting algorithm for such context is called as described before: **parallel fractional stepping** or simply **fractional stepping**.

However, the matrix exponential itself being approximated by a fraction could be:
$$
e^{\tau (A_x + A_y + A_raw)} \approx e^{\tau A_x} \cdot e^{\tau A_y} \cdot e^{\tau A_z}.
$$

However, a shorter term that matches the question description would be "fractional stepping."

However, when you need to fill in the blank for something already stated in the question now seems to be over-complicated here. To make our answer fit the question context exactly:

It seems that Reddy "While solving higher dimensional heat equations subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions through higher order finite difference approximations and **parallel splitting**, the matrix exponential function is approximated by a fractional approximation."
They likely expect the answer to be what parallelism is based on.

Most appropriate fill in seems like:

Answer: **operator splitting** or **splitting techniques** is the key factor here. Another very close answer could be domain decomposition.

Thusbased on given scatter scenario:
Another candidate term could be **parallel fractional stepping** might be closer contextually.
