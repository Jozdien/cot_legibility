To solve for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of $X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^-$, we need to find what "resolution" here refers to. The term "resolution" typically refers to the ability to distinguish points along a path traveled by a particle, such as the spatial resolution required to detect a decay vertex.

The decay described here is $X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ + Z^-$. The given proper lifetime of $X^0$ is $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16}$ seconds. The energy of the $X^0$ particle in the bubble chamber is given as $27$ GeV, while the rest mass of $X^0$ is given as $3.41$ GeV.

To find the "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays," what matters here is the observed "visible" track length in the detector for the $X^0$ particle prior to its decay. To solve for this, we need to find the "proper time" necessary such that 30% of the $X^0$ particles decay while still in the chamber such that their decay can be observed.

The decay follows an exponential decay law where the proper time (i.e., time in the rest frame of the particle) distribution follows:
$$
N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\tau_0},
$$
where $N_0$ is the initial number of particles and $N(t)$ is the number of remaining particles after time $t$ (proper time).

However, we need to find the probability that a given $X^0$ particle decays within a given proper time $t$. The probability that a single $X^0$ particle decays within a time $\Delta t$ (in the rest frame) is given by:
$$
P(t \leq \Delta t) = 1 - e^{-\Delta t / \tau_0}.
$$
However, what we need here is the proper time duration such that the decay probability reaches $0.3$ (i.e., observing 30%\ of the decays):
$$
0.3 = 1 - e^{-\Delta t / \tau_0}.
$$
Solving for $\Delta t$:
$$
0.7 = e^{-\Delta t / \tau_0} \\
\ln(0.7) = -\frac{\Delta t}{\tau_0} \\
\Delta t = -\tau_0 \ln(0.7).
$$
The given proper lifetime is $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16}$ seconds. Using this:
$$
\Delta t = - (8 \times 10^{-16}) \ln(0.7).
$$
We need to calculate $\ln(0.7)$:
$$
\ln(0.7) \approx \ln(7) - \ln(10) \approx 1.945910149 - 2.302585093 \approx -0.356674944.
$$
Therefore:
$$
\Delta t = - (8 \times 10^{-16}) \times (-0.356674944) \approx 2.853 \times 10^{-16} \times 8 \approx 2.8534 \times 10^{-16} \text{ seconds}.
$$
However, our previous part seems to make a mistake here. The calculation should be:
$$
1 - e^{-\Delta t / \tau_0} = 0.3 \Rightarrow 0.3 = 1 - e^{-\Delta t / \tau_0} \Rightarrow e^{-\Delta t / \tau_0} = 0.7.
$$
This part seems a bit off because our aim here is simpler. As previously stated correctly above, the proper lifetime $\tau_0$ itself is $8 \times 10^{-16}$ seconds. However, what we need here is the "lifetime" in the laboratory frame (which is what is relevant here when mentioning the "observed decay length" in the bubble chamber). 

However, the question seems to be implying that the "resolution" needed should be interpreted as the "mean decay length" seen in the lab frame where decays need to be spatially resolvable until 30% of $X^0$ particles have decayed. 

To find the "resolution" required (which is a distance in the lab frame), we need first to find the mean decay length $L$ in the lab frame such that on average $70\%$ of the $X^0$ particles have not yet decayed such that (reaching until the $30\%$ decay point makes us observe $30\%$ of decays). 

The "mean lifetime $\tau$" in the laboratory frame is given by:
$$\tau = \gamma \tau_0,$$
where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor defined as:
$$
\gamma = \frac{E}{m_0 c^2},
$$
where $E$ is the total energy of the $X^0$ particle in the laboratory frame (which is given as $27\text{ GeV}$), and $m_0$ is the rest mass of $X^0$ given as $3.41 \text{ GeV}$ (note that usually $c=1$ in natural units where energies and masses are expressed in GeV):
$$
\gamma = \frac{27 \text{ GeV}}{3.41 \text{ GeV}} \approx 7.9179.
$$
The lifetime in the lab frame $\tau_{\text{lab}}$ is thus approximately:
$$
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0\\
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \tau_\gamma = \gamma \cdot 8 \times 10^{-16} \text{ seconds} \simeq 7.9179 \times 8\times10^{-16} \text{ seconds} \\
\tau_{\text{lab}} \approx 7.9179 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \\
\tau_{\text{lab}} \approx 6.3343 \times 10^{-15} \text{ seconds}.
$$
However, what we need next is the "distance" $d$ traveled in the lab frame until the point where $30\%$ of decays have happened. To find this, we need first to compute the velocity $v$ of the $X^0$ particle in the lab frame. Recall:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}},
$$
where $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$ ($v$ is the particle velocity and $c$ is the speed of light). So,
$$
7.9179 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \\
(7.9179)^2 = \frac{1}{(1 - \beta^2)} \\
62.69 \approx \frac{1}{1 - \beta^2} \\
1 - \beta^2 = \frac{1}{62.69} \approx 0.01595 \\
\beta^2 \approx 1 - 0.01595 \\
\beta \approx \sqrt{0.984} \approx 0.992,
$$
i.e., $v \approx 0.992 \, c$. Another way to find the momentum $p$ which might help us verify the reasoning here is:
$$
E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m_0^2 c^4.
$$
Using $E = 27 \text{ GeV}$ and $m_0 c^2 = 3.41 \text{ GeV}$ (since $ c=1$):
$$
p^2 = E^2 - m_0^2,
$$
so:
$$
p^2 = (27 \text{ GeV})^2 - (3.41 \text{ GeV})^2 \\
p^2 \approx 729 - 11.6281 \approx 717.3719 \text{ GeV}^2 \\
p \approx 26.98 \text{ GeV}/c.
$$
But here, in order to find the velocity $v$, another way to write $v$ is:
$$
v = \frac{p c^2}{E}.
$$
For $E=27\text{ GeV}$, $p \approx 26.98 \text{ GeV}/c$, and $c=1$:
$$
v = \frac{p}{E} \cdot c.\\
v = \frac{26.98}{27} \cdot c \approx 0.99926c.
$$
However, the first way to find $v$ might have been a bit inaccurate due to round-off errors. So instead, let us round the Lorentz factor $\gamma$ to a higher accuracy until performing the last operation:
$$
\gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9179,
$$
$$
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{7.9179}\right)^2} \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{62.69313841}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.0159507} \approx \sqrt{0.9840493} \approx 0.99199 \approx 0.992.
$$
Thus, the velocity $v$ is thus:
$$
v = 0.992c.
$$
However, the real question requires finding what "resolution" we need so that $30\%$ of the decays can be observed. 

The mean lifetime in the laboratory frame is:
$$
\tau_{lab} = \gamma\tau_0.
$$
We need to find the "mean travel distance" such that 30% of decays have occurred. However, what matters here is the "mean decay length" until $30\%$ of decays happen. 

The "laboratory decay length" until a particle would have a $30\%$ chance to decay should be:
$$
L_{\text{decay}} = v \tau_{\text{lab}} \cdot p_{\text{lifetime}},
$$
where $p_{\text{lifetime}}$ is the fraction of the mean lifetime in the lab frame until $30\%$ of the $X^0$ particles decay.

The "mean lifetime" has already been defined such that this represents the average time until decay in the lab frame. Thus, the "mean decay length" (which is the average decay length observed in the lab frame) until a particle survives is:
$$
L_{\text{mean_decay}} = v \tau_{\text{lab}} = v \tau_\gamma = v \gamma \tau_0.
$$
However, a deeper dive into what the $30\%$ decay point means might make us a bit clearer. 

The probability that a particle decays at a given proper time $t_0$ is defined such that:
$$
N(t_0) = N_0 e^{-t_0 / \tau_0}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\frac{N(t_0)}{N_0} = e^{-t_0 / \tau_0}.
$$
The probability that a particle has not yet decayed after proper time $t_0$ is $e^{-t_0 / \tau_0}$, so $1 - e^{-t_0 / \tau_0}$ is the probability that it has decayed within proper time $t_0$. 

However, what we need is the probability that a particle decays by a given laboratory time $t_{\text{lab}}$ which is related to proper time $t_0$ as:
$$
t_0 = \frac{t_{\text{lab}}}{\gamma}.
$$
Thus, the laboratory time until $30\%$ of the initial particles decay can be found by solving for $t_{\text{lab}}$ such that:
$$
1 - e^{-t_{\text{lab}} / (\gamma \tau_0)} = 0.3,
$$
where $t_{\text{lab}}$ is the laboratory time where $30\%$ of the $X^0$ particles have decayed. From here:
$$
0.7 = e^{-\frac{t_{\text{lab}}}{\gamma \tau_0}}.
$$
Hence:
$$
\ln(0.7) = -\frac{t_{\text{lab}}}{\gamma \tau_0} \\
t_{\text{lab}} = - \gamma \tau_0 \ln(0.7)\\
t_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau_0 \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.7}\right).
$$
However, what we need to find here is the "distance traveled" in the lab frame until this $30\%$ decay point. Thus, the "distance traveled" until $30\%$ decay probability is:
$$
d = v \cdot t_{\text{lab}}.
$$
We previously computed:
$$
\gamma \approx 7.9179,
$$
$$
\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \text{ sec}.
$$
$$
t_{\text{lab}} = 7.9179 \times (8 \times 10^{-16}) \times \ln\left(\frac{10}{7}\right).
$$
$$
\ln\left(\frac{10}{7}\right) \approx \ln(10) - \ln(7) \approx 2.302585093 - 1.945910149 \approx 0.356674944.
$$
Thus:
$$
t_{\text{lab}} = 7.9179 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \times 0.356674944,
$$
Thus:
$$
t_{\text{lab}} = 7.9179 \times 8 \times 0.356674944 \times 10^{-16} \approx 2.2595 \times 10^{-15} \text{ seconds}.
$$
So, the distance traveled until $30\%$ decay:
$$
d = v \times t_{lab} \approx (0.992 \cdot 3 \times 10^8) \times 2.2595 \times 10^{-15}.
$$
$$
d \approx 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.2595 \times 10^{-15} \text{ meters}.
$$
Since $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$:
$$
d \approx 0.992 \times 2.2595 \times 3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ meters} \approx 0.992 \times 6.7785 \times 10^{-7} \text{ meters} \approx 6.725 \times 10^{-7} \text{ meters}.
$$
Hence, the "minimum resolution" needed should hence be on the order of:
$$
d \approx 6.725 \times 10^{-7} \text{ meters} \text{ (or } 0.6725 \text{ micrometers)}.
$$
However, a more "usual" unit can be used here such:
$$
d \approx 0.6725 \text{ micrometers}.
$$
However, it makes sense to make a round-up check here and round the answer properly:

Considering roundings and a more careful check of the units:
$$
\gamma = \frac{27GeV}{3.41GeV} \approx 7.9185.
$$
$$
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \gamma^{-2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - (7.9185)^{-2}} \approx 0.99199.
$$
Thus:
$$
t_{lab} = 7.9185 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}s \times 0.3567.
$$
$$
t_{lab} \approx 2.2587 \times 10^{-15} \text{ seconds}.
$$
$$
\text{Distance} \approx \beta c \times t_{lab} \approx 0.99199 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.2587 \times 10^{-15}.
$$
$$
d \approx 6.7226 \times 10^(-7) \text{ meters}.
$$
So, apparently, the answer seems to round consistently around $0.67 \mu m$.

Note however that what should be verified here is the actual "lab frame distance" traveled until the lab frame time such that $30\%$ of the particles decayed:
Another check could be directly calculating the "average decay length" in the lab frame, which usually refers to:
$$
L = \beta c \tau_{lab} = \beta c \gamma \tau_0.
$$
So:
$$
L = 0.99199 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 7.9179 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}.
$$
$$
L = 0.99199 \times 3 \times 7.9179 \times 8 \times 10^{-8}.
$$
which is:
$$
L \approx 1.8854 \times 10^{-6} \text{ meters} \approx 1.89 \mu m.
$$
However, the "average decay length" here might refer to the full mean decay length until the average particle decays which seems a bit long compared to what we need explicitly for $30\%$ decay event.

So, we need to solve correctly for the "distance needed until $30\%$ of $X^0$ particles have decayed." 

Let $l$ be the distance traveled until $30\%$ of the $X^0$ particles have decayed:
$$
l = v \cdot t_{\text{lab}}.
$$
To find the proper time until $30\%$ decay probability:
$$
0.3 = 1 - e^{-t_0/\tau_0} \Rightarrow t_0 = -\tau_0 \ln(0.7).
$$
We need to find the corresponding lab time until $30\%$ decay:
$$
t_{\text{lab}} = \gamma t_0 = \gamma \times (-\tau_0 \ln (0.7)) = -\gamma\tau_0 \ln (0.7),
$$
hence,
$$
t_{\text{lab}} = 7.9179 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \times (-\ln(0.7)).
$$
$$
\bar{t}_s = 7.9179 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \times 0.356674944.
$$
$$
t_{\text{lab}} \approx 2.2587 \times 10^{-15} \text{ seconds}.
$$
And then the lab distance traveled until this lab time is:
$$
d_{\text{lab}} = v \times t_{\text{lab}}.
$$
$$
d_{\text{lab}} = 0.99199 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.2587 \times 10^{-15} \text{ meters.
}
$$
$$
d_{\text{lab}} = 6.72567 \times 10^{-7} \text{ meters} = 0.6726 \text{ micrometers}.
$$

So, the minimum resolution needed should indeed be such that the decay can be resolved when the particle has traveled a distance where $30\%$ of them have decayed. This means we need to be able to resolve a distance that is approximately $0.6725 \, \mu m$.

However, the question might be asking about the "average path length" until decay such that $30\%$ have decayed. Another way to look at "resolution" might be:
$$
\text{Resolution} \geq
