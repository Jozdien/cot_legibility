# Original Question

You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

To solve for what proteins would be part of the active chromatin fraction when treating yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* with a quorum-sensing peptide from *Lactobacillus acidophilus* and observing the formation of a shmoo, we need to understand what a shmoo is and what proteins might be part of the active chromatin in this context.

The "shmoo" is a term used in yeast biology to describe a pear-shaped cell morphology that yeast cells (specifically, cells of the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) adopt when they are responding to mating pheromones. Shmoo formation occurs primarily during the mating process where two mating types of yeast, MATa and MATα, respond to pheromones (a-factor or α-factor) secreted by cells of the opposite mating type. For instance, MATa cells respond to α-factor by forming a shmoo towards the source of the α-factor.

The question asks about recovering the active chromatin proteome by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry, focusing on identifying proteins from specific chromatin complexes when a shmoo is formed. Given that the question mentions "active chromatin proteome," it's important to identify which complex among given options could be involved in active chromatin and what roles each complex plays:

1. **RSC (Remodels the Structure of Chromatin) complex:**
    
    The RSC complex is indeed a chromatin remodeling complex which functions primarily in modifying chromatin structure through ATP-dependent remodeling activity such as sliding or repositioning nucleosomes. This makes certain regions of the chromatin more accessible for transcription factors and other proteins, potentially making it part of the "active chromatin" proteome.
    
2. **Ino80 complex:**
    
    Similarly, diverse families of remodeling complexes such as ISWI, SWI/SNF (including RSC), and Ino80 are involved in active chromatin remodeling. The INO80 complex is particularly known for its role in nucleosome sliding and histone exchange, thus potentially being part of active chromatin interactions as well.
    
3. **SWI/SNF complex:**
    
    The SWI/SNF (Switch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) complex is another chromatin remodeling complex involved in making chromatin more accessible for transcription. It shares functions similar to RSC and is also part of the active chromatin proteome.
    
4. **NURD complex (**NuRD: Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase):
    
    The NURD (NuRD) complex typically acts as a chromatin remodeling complex that includes histone de-acetylase activity (HDAC), which usually leads to a closed chromatin structure associated with transcriptional repression rather than active transcription. Therefore, if one is looking for proteins primarily involved in "active chromatin," proteins from the NuRD complex might not be as enriched specifically in the active chromatin scenario compared to the other options provided.

Formation of a shmoo usually leads to a complex signaling cascade (including MAP Kinase signaling pathways), inducing gene expression changes that make the cell prepare for mating. These changes would involve transcription factors binding to active chromatin regions where remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF, RSC, and INO80 could potentially function.

Based on this reasoning, the complex whose proteins you would least observe in active chromatin is likely the **NURD** due to its function in chromatin repression rather than activation. 

This makes **Choice D ("NURD")** the correct answer.

To make our reasoning about active chromatin more succinct, here’s a previous general understanding:
    
Active chromatin associated with cell growth processes such as shmoo formation needs open chromatin states regulated by chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF, RSC, and INO80. However, since the NuRD complex typically plays a key role in repressing transcription by deacetylating histones and remodeling chromatin into a more compacted ("repressed") state ("closed" chromatin), proteins from the NuRD (NURD) complex are likely the least observed in active chromatin proteome recovery from a shmoo-induced state in *S. cerevisiae*.

Thus, the answer should be:
D. NURD
However, there seems to be a typographical error in the question choice given as *“NURD”* which seems should be “NuRD” (correctly NuRD is the common abbreviation for Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase complex).

Hence, the reasoning makes "NURD" the least likely candidate you would observe in an active chromatin proteome.
