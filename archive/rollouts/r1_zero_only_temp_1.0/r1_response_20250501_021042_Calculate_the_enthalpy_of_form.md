To solve for the enthalpy of formation of the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2, let us first interpret the given question and recall what needs to be done. 

The goal here is to calculate the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) for the given compound:
(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let us first draw the Lewis structure of this compound systematically:
1. The main chain can be analyzed from the name (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
    
2. First, let us expand the given molecule part by part:
    
    (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2
    
    It seems the main carbon chain is structured as follows if we expand it step-by-step:
    
    (CH3)2C is a part where a carbon atom is bonded to two CH3 groups:
    (CH3)2 implies that two methyl groups ("CH3") are attached to a carbon atom ("C").
    
    Therefore, the part (CH3)2C can be interpreted as:
    
$$
\text{(CH3)2C} = \text{(CH3)2-C} = \text{H3C-C-CH3}
$$
where the central carbon forms part of a carbon chain where another part of the chain attaches to the same carbon where the two CH3 groups are also attached. Another part attached to this carbon atom is a double bond to another carbon atom ("=CH"). 

3. The next part is "=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2":
    
    Extending from the (CH3)2C part, there is a double bond:
    
    (CH3)2C=CH means that another part of the molecule is connected to the same carbon atom where there already are two CH3 groups as well as another single carbon atom ("C") connected through a double bond ("=CH"). Hence, the part looks like:
    
$$
\Rightarrow \text{(CH3)2C}=CH\underset{\text{C=C connection here}}{\text{-CH(CH3)2C}=CH-\text{CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2}}
$$
    
4. To make it simpler, let us draw the molecule systematically:
   
   (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2
    
   To make it even more structured, let us number the carbon atoms in the main chain (excluding the CH3 groups explicitly for now, and focus initially on the main carbon backbone where double bonds are explicitly marked):

$$
\underset{1}{\text{(CH3)2C}} = \underset{2}{\text{CH}} - \underset{3}{\text{CH2}} - \underset{4}{\text{CH(CH3)}} - \underset{5}{\text{CH2}} - \underset{6}{\text{CH}} = \underset{7}{\text{C(CH3)2}}
$$
The main carbon chain thus appears to be "C1"-"C2"-"C3"-"C4"-"C5"-"C6"-"C7" where the double bonds are on C1=C2 and C6=C7. Hence, the main carbon chain has seven carbon atoms (excluding the methyl groups).

5. Another important part here is:
    
    Bond energies are given:
    - Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (which might actually refer to the sublimation energy of carbon which makes gaseous carbon atoms) = 1000 kJ/mol.
    - Bond energy of H-H bond = 100 kJ/mol.
    - Bond energy of C-C bond = 200 kJ/mol.
    - Bond energy of C=C bond = 300 kJ/mol.
    - Bond energy of C-H bond = 400 kJ/mol.

To solve for the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of the compound, we need to define the reaction for the formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2 from its elements in their standard states (carbon in its standard state is solid graphite while hydrogen is H2 gas):

$$
ΔH_f^\circ = ΔH_{\text{(Products)}}^\circ - ΔH_{\text{(Reactants)}}^\circ
$$
However, here the goal is to make the given compound from gaseous atoms of carbon and hydrogen (since bond energies are typically defined as the energy required to break a bond resulting in gaseous atoms). However, the "enthalpy of formation" traditionally refers to the reaction forming the compound from its elements in their standard states where carbon is usually in the solid state (graphite) and hydrogen is usually in the form of H2 gas.

However, the problem statement provides "enthalpy of atomization" of carbon which seems to be the energy needed to make one mole of carbon atoms from solid carbon (typically this reaction looks like: $C(s) \rightarrow C(g)$ where the given value is 1000 kJ/mol.

For enthalpy of formation of the compound from its elements in their standard states, the reaction can be written as:
$$
x \text{ C(graphite)} + y \text{ H2(g)} \rightarrow \text{(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2}
$$
However, what makes this question a bit tricky is that what we need here is a step-by-step assembly of the molecule from carbon and hydrogen atoms where the bond energies can be utilized. Thus, we need a hypothetical reaction where all individual carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms are on one side and the compound on the other:
$$
a \text{ C(g)} + b \text{ H(g)} \rightarrow \text{(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2}
$$
To solve properly, let us first sum up the total carbon and hydrogen atoms in the compound (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Total carbon atoms in (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:
- First part (CH3)2C consists of 3 carbon atoms where "C" holds two CH3 groups (total of three carbon atoms where two are from CH3 groups and one is the central carbon).
- The part CH contributes one carbon atom.
- The part CH2 contributes one carbon atom.
- CH(CH3) contributes two carbon atoms (again one is mentioned explicitly and one from the CH3).
- Another CH2 adds another carbon atom.
- The part CH contributes one carbon atom.
- The part C(CH3)2 consists again of three carbon atoms where one is the carbon itself and two come from the CH3 groups.

Total carbon atoms are thus:
$$
3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12\text{ carbon atoms}
$$

Total hydrogen atoms in (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:
- First part (CH3)2C: CH3 has three hydrogens, so two CH3 groups give us six hydrogens from the (CH3)2 part. However, the attached carbon itself might already be part of the chain which does not directly contribute any hydrogens on its own for now.
- CH part comes after the (CH3)2C= part; "CH" provides one hydrogen.
- CH2 provides two hydrogens.
- CH(CH3) has one hydrogen from the "CH" part (excluding the "CH3" part which needs to be handled separately), so one hydrogen from there and an extra three from CH3 for a total of four hydrogens coming from the part CH(CH3).
- Another CH2 contributes two hydrogens.
- CH again provides one hydrogen.
- Finally, the C(CH3)2 part contains two CH3 groups again which means another six hydrogens.

Total hydrogen atoms are thus:
$$
6 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22\text{ hydrogen atoms}
$$
Therefore, the hypothetical reaction for forming the molecule from its constituent atoms can be written as:
$$
12\text{ C(g)} + 22\text{ H(g)} \rightarrow \text{(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2}
$$
However, we need the enthalpy of formation from atoms which is essentially the reverse reaction of breaking all the bonds in our molecule until only isolated gaseous carbon and hydrogen atoms remain. Hence, what we need here is the total bond enthalpy (total energy released when forming all the bonds in the compound given by the negative of the total bond energies).

First, let us count the bonds explicitly within the compound structure. 

To make it clear, let us write down the structure explicitly again (note that we need to correctly identify the bonds in the compound such as C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds).

#### Drawing structure explicitly:
1. For this, let us first recall the proper structure you derived previously:
$$
\underset{(1)}{\text{(CH3)2C}}=\underset{(2)}{\text{CH}}-\underset{(3)}{\text{CH2}}-\underset{(4)}{\text{CH(CH3)}}-\underset{(5)}{\text{CH2}}-\underset{(6)}{\text{CH}}=\underset{(7)}{\text{C(CH3)2}}
$$
Note that the main chain goes from C1 to C7 where C1=C2 is one double bond and C6=C7 is another double bond.

Now, let us draw the structure explicitly:
$$
\text{H3C}-\underset{\text{(C1)}}{\underset{\text{CH3}}{\overset{\text{CH3}|}{\text{C}}}}=\underset{\text{(C2)}}{\text{CH}}-\underset{\text{(C3)}}{\text{CH2}}-\underset{\text{(C4)}}{\underset{\text{CH3}}{\overset{|}{\text{CH}}}}-\underset{\text{(C5)}}{\text{CH2}}-\underset{\text{(C6)}}{\text{CH}}=\underset{\text{(C7)}}{\underset{\text{CH3}}{\overset{\text{CH3}|}{\text{C}}}}
$$
2. To make it even more explicit:
$$
\text{H3C} \text{-}(C1)\text{(CH3)}-\text{C1}=C2-H-C3-H2-C4-H(\text{CH3})-C5-H2-C6-H=C7(\text{CH3})-H3C
$$
Total bonds can be counted as follows:
    - C1 is bonded to two CH3 groups (i.e., two C-C single bonds linking C1 to CH3 groups if we ignore the H atoms for now), one double bond to C2, and three C-H bonds (since one CH3 group has three C-H bonds and thus two CH3 groups mean six C-H bonds but we need to verify again).
    
    - C2 is bonded to C1 through a double bond (thus one C=C bond), one single bond to C3, and one C-H bond because it is a "CH" unit.
    
    - C3 is bonded to C2 via a single bond, another single bond to C4, and two C-H bonds due to being a "CH2" unit.
    
    - C4 is bonded to C3 by a single bond, another single bond to C5, one C-H bond because it is a "CH" unit where one H is directly attached (excluding CH3 group), and one C-C single bond to another CH3 group here thus three additional C-H bonds from that CH3 group.
    
    - C5 is bonded to C4 with a single bond, another single bond to C6, and two C-H bonds from the "CH2" unit.
    
    - C6 is bonded to C5 by a single bond, a double bond to C7 which means one bond is a C=C bond, and one C-H bond because it is a "CH" unit.
    
    - Finally, C7 is bonded to C6 through a double bond (so one C=C bond here), a single bond to two CH3 groups (hence two C-C single bonds), and six C-H bonds because there are two CH3 groups attached here.

#### Detail break-down:
1. Total C atoms are 12 and total H atoms are 22.
Total molecular formula = $\text{C12H22}$

Based on the provided structure, we need to identify the total number of C-C single bonds, C=C double bonds, and C-H bonds.

##### Counting C-C bonds:
1. Connecting C1 to two CH3 groups: two C-C single bonds (C1 to two CH3 groups).
2. Connection between C1 and C2 should be a double bond here (we need to be careful here to only recognize what part is a single or double bond).
3. C2 to C3 is a single C-C bond.
4. C3 to C4 is another single C-C bond.
5. At C4, there's another C-C bond connecting C4 to a CH3 group.
6. C4 to C5 is again a single C-C bond.
7. C5 to C6 is another C-C bond.
8. C6 to C7 is a double C=C bond.
9. C7 connects additionally to two CH3 groups hence two more C-C single bonds.
    
Total C-C single bonds thus formed are (excluding the C=C double bonds which are only there for the C1=C2 and C6=C7 connections):
1. C1-CH3 bonds (2 bonds).
2. C2-C3 bond (1 bond).
3. C3-C4 bond (1 bond).
4. C4-CH3 bond (1 bond).
5. C4-C5 bond (1 bond).
6. C5-C6 bond (1 bond).
7. C7-CH3 bonds (2 bonds).
Total C-C single bonds thus equal:
$$
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9
$$
Total C=C double bonds:
$$
2 \text{ (C1-C2 and C6-C7)}
$$
##### Counting C-H bonds:
Total hydrogen atoms in the compound are $22$, thus there should be a total of $22$ C-H bonds until every hydrogen is bonded to a carbon atom. 

#### The enthalpy of forming the given compound thus involves forming multiple bonds whose bond energies are given as follows:
$$
\text{Bond energy of C-C} = 200 \text{ kJ/mol} \\
\text{Bond energy of C=C} = 300 \text{ kJ/mol} \\
\text{Bond energy of C-H} = 400 \text{ kJ/mol} \\
\text{Bond energy of H-H} = 100 \text{ kJ/mol} \\
\text{Enthalpy of atomization of carbon} = 1000 \text{ kJ/mol}
$$
The given reaction involving bond formation (from gaseous atoms) would release energy (hence, bond formation is usually exothermic and thus releases negative bond energy values):
$$
\text{ΔH_f} = [(\text{Total bond energy released forming compound from atoms})] - [(\text{Total energy required to make isolated carbon and hydrogen atoms from their standard states})]
$$
First, we need to calculate the total energy required to make isolated carbon and hydrogen atoms from their standard states where:
$$
12 \text{ C(s)} \rightarrow 12 \text{ C(g)} \text{ (where carbon's atomization requires energy of 1000 kJ/mol per carbon atom)} \therefore 12 \times 1000 = 12000 \text{ kJ} \\
11 \text{ H2(g)} \rightarrow 22 \text{ H(g)} \text{ (where bond energy of H-H bond is 100 kJ/mol)} \therefore 11 \times 100 = 1100 \text{ kJ}
$$
Total energy required for atomization or atom formation thus is:
$$
12000 + 1100 = 13100 \text{ kJ}
$$
Now, let us find the enthalpy change when forming the compound from isolated atoms. This is the sum of energies released when bonds are formed from isolated atoms:
1. For C-C single bonds:
$$
9 \times (-200) \text{ kJ} = -1800 \text{ kJ}
$$
2. For C=C double bonds:
$$
2 \times (-300) \text{ kJ} = -600 \text{ kJ}
$$
3. For C-H bonds (22 C-H bonds are present):
$$
22 \times (-400) \text{ kJ} = -8800 \text{ kJ}
$$
Total bond energy released during forming the compound from atoms:
$$
-1800 - 600 - 8800 = -11200 \text{ kJ}
$$

To find the standard enthalpy of formation of the compound from carbon in standard graphite form and hydrogen in H2 form, we need to sum up all contributions together (including atomization from standard states and bond formation reaction):
Thus:
$$
ΔH_f^\circ = [\text{Energy required to atomize the elements}] + [\text{Bond formation energy from atoms}]
$$
Therefore,
$$
ΔH_f^\circ = 12000\text{ kJ}_{(\text{carbon})} + 1100\text{ kJ}_{(\text{hydrogen})} - 11200\text{ kJ}_{(\text{bond formation})}
$$
However, what we need here is the energy required to convert elements in their standard states to the final compound. From the values already computed:
$$
ΔH_f^\circ = 12000\text{ kJ} + 1100\text{ kJ} + (-11200\text{ kJ}) = 1900 \text{ kJ}
$$
Therefore, the standard enthalpy of formation for $(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2$ can be computed as follows:

If $\Delta H_f$ represents the reaction where carbon in its standard state (graphite) and hydrogen gas form the given hydrocarbon, our goal is:
$$
12\text{ C(graphite)} + 11\text{ H2(g)} \rightarrow (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2
$$
Total enthalpy change described previously makes sense considering all bond energies and atomization energies combined. However, we need to verify such a step-wise reasoning:
$$
ΔH_f = \text{(Total bond energy required to break up elements into atoms)} - \text{(Total bond energies in the compound)}
$$
However, the “enthalpy of atomization” is usually defined such that:
$$
ΔH_{\text{reaction}} = ΔH_{\text{(bonds broken in the reactants)}} - ΔH_{\text{(bonds formed in products)}}
$$
Yet another framework for the question is also valid using "heat of atomization" and bond dissociation energies such that:
$$
ΔH_f = (\text{Bonds broken}) - (\text{Bunds formed})
$$
Another way might be "bonds formed in reactants" (breaking bond is positive and making bonds is negative).
