# Original Question

The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).
Arrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

To solve for the relative nucleophilicity of the given nucleophiles in an aqueous solution, we need to recall some general trends for nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents (such as water). 

The main factors that affect nucleophilicity are:
1. **Charge**: A negatively charged species is usually a stronger nucleophile than a neutral molecule.
2. **Electronegativity**: For atoms in the same period, a lower electronegativity makes a stronger nucleophile because such atoms are more likely to share electrons.
3. **Polarizability**: Higher polarizability makes a species a better nucleophile.
4. **Steric hindrance**: Bulky groups around the nucleophilic atom can make it a poor nucleophile.
5. **Solvent effects**: Polar protic solvents can hydrogen bond with nucleophiles, reducing their nucleophilicity. This typically hinders nucleophiles that are negatively charged and capable of forming hydrogen bonds. Thus, in polar protic solvents, larger and less solvated anions tend to be better nucleophiles due to less solvation ("more naked" nucleophile).

Given these general trends, in a polar protic solvent such as water, the order of nucleophilicity often follows:
1. **Anions are generally stronger nucleophiles than neutral species. Within anions, larger atoms make better nucleophiles because they are less effectively solvated (i.e., sulfur is larger so thiolate should be a stronger nucleophile than oxyanions).
2. Among species where the nucleophilic atom is the same (typically oxygen here), the more negatively charged nucleophile should be a stronger nucleophile.

Let us analyze the given nucleophiles:

1. **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: This is an alkoxide ion where the negative charge is on an oxygen atom.
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻)**: Also a negatively charged species where the negative charge is on an oxygen atom.
3. **Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻)**: This is a carboxylate anion where the negative charge is delocalized between two oxygen atoms (resonance stabilized).
4. **Methanol (CH3OH)**: A neutral molecule where oxygen has a lone pair, thus it acts as a nucleophile, but it lacks a negative charge unlike the first three listed nucleophiles.
5. **Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻)**: A negatively charged thiolate where the negative charge is on a sulfur atom.

To compare these nucleophiles, one should compare pairs based on similar nucleophilic atom types first (i.e., oxygen vs. sulfur). Within the oxoanions, the alkoxide (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate and hydroxide) should be compared with carboxylate (propionate). 

For the comparison among negatively charged species:
**4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate vs. Hydroxide vs. Propionate vs. Ethanethiolate (excluding methanol for now because it is neutral):**

**Charge comparison:**
    4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is an alkoxide ion (RO⁻ where R is 4-methylcyclohexyl group), hydroxide (OH⁻) is also an alkoxide ion where R is H. Both have a charge of -1 and the negative charge is on an oxygen atom. Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) is a carboxylate ion where the negative charge is delocalized over two oxygen atoms (resonance stabilization makes this anion less reactive as a nucleophile compared to a localized charge on one oxygen such as in hydroxide or 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate).

However, ethanolate (from "Ethanethiolate") has a negative charge on a sulfur atom. Sulfur is larger and thus less electronegative compared to oxygen and is also more polarizable. Therefore, in polar protic solvents like water, larger atoms like sulfur are usually better nucleophiles because they are less effectively solvated.

#### Based on the charge alone:
**Anions versus neutral molecules:**
    Methanol (CH3OH) should be the poorest nucleophile among the given options because it lacks a negative charge.

#### Comparing the anions specifically:
1. **Base strength and Nucleophilicity:** 

    Typically, stronger bases make stronger nucleophiles when comparing nucleophiles that have attacking atoms from the same group of the periodic table (such as oxygen atoms). However, this isn’t universally true when comparing nucleophiles across different atoms (e.g., oxygen versus sulfur). 

2. **Polarizability and size:** 
    Generally, in polar protic solvents, larger atoms are stronger nucleophiles because they are less well solvated. Thus, CH3CH2S⁻ should be the strongest nucleophile because sulfur is larger and more polarizable than oxygen.

3. **Comparison among oxygen-based nucleophiles:**
    Hydroxide (OH⁻) is a strong base and a good nucleophile. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is also a strong base and a good nucleophile.
    
However, propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) is a weaker nucleophile compared to hydroxide and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate because the negative charge is delocalized over two oxygen atoms, reducing its "local" negative charge density and hence its nucleophilicity.

#### Ordering nucleophilicity in polar protic solvents (such as water):
Based on charge and charge delocalization:
1. Anions are generally stronger than neutral nucleophiles (thus, methanol should be the weakest nucleophile listed here).
2. Among anions, those with a negative charge on a sulfur atom are usually better nucleophiles than those with a charge on an oxygen atom (thus, ethanethiolate should be stronger than the oxygen-containing anions).
3. Among oxygen-containing anions, those without charge delocalization should be stronger.
    
Based on this reasoning, a plausible order can be:
1. **Ethanethiolate (strongest)**: Negatively charged, sulfur is larger and less solvated in aqueous solution.
2. Among the oxygen anions, hydroxide and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate should be considered next.
    
However, 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate has a bulky group (4-methylcyclohexyl), which might make it a bit sterically hindered compared to hydroxide. However, another factor here might be to compare the basicity of the two (we need stronger bases usually are stronger nucleophiles within similar atoms).

However, for alkoxide ions such as 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate versus hydroxide (OH⁻), the lower basicity alkoxide (due to steric and inductive effects) can still vary widely based on the pKa of the corresponding alcohol. The pKa of water is about 15.7 while pKa values for aliphatic alcohols are usually close to 16 (e.g., for cyclohexanol, it's higher, so its conjugate base would be a slightly weaker base than hydroxide). However, typically, stronger bases make stronger nucleophiles unless steric hindrance plays a significant role.

Another important observation is that hydroxide is a smaller molecule than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate which means it could be better solvated in an aqueous solution, which makes it less "free" and thus slightly less reactive compared to the big, bulky 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate which might be less solvated due to its steric bulk. However, the usual trend is that bulkier nucleophiles are poorer nucleophiles due to steric hindrance. Hence, it might be a balance between steric hindrance and solvation effects.

Propionate should be a weaker nucleophile than both hydroxide and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate because of charge delocalization.

So, given the combined effects (basic strength, charge localization, polarizability, and steric hindrance), a likely order of nucleophilicity from highest to lowest might be:

$$
\text{Ethanethiolate > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > Hydroxide > Propionate > Methanol}
$$
However, a further check might verify that in polar protic solvents, the order could be inverted such that a more polarizable molecule like ethanethiolate should indeed be strongest. Within oxygen nucleophiles without resonance stabilization, the order could be:
$$
\text{Ethanethiolate > Hydroxide > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > Propionate > Methanol}
$$
However, the question requires us to order from the most reactive nucleophile to the poorest reactive nucleophile in an aqueous solution.

We need to recall another specific rule for nucleophilicity orders in polar protic solvents such as water. The order might often be such that the bigger/larger and less solvated nucleophiles are stronger. Thus, the order is usually:
$$
RS⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > F⁻ > RO⁻ > OH⁻ > ROH
$$
(This is because larger anions such as RS⁻ are less solvated in polar protic solvents, making them more "free" and thus stronger nucleophiles). Therefore, the ethanethiolate ion should be the strongest nucleophile among the given choices.

Within alkoxides such as hydroxide and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, the hydroxide ion is usually a stronger nucleophile than alkoxides derived from more bulky alkyl groups such as in tert-butoxide where steric hindrance plays a role. However, for a 4-methylcyclohexyl group, the bulkiness might make it slightly less nucleophilic compared to hydroxide ion which is a smaller and well-known strong nucleophile.

Keeping in mind that carboxylate ions are usually much weaker nucleophiles due to resonance stabilization of the negative charge (making them less "desire" to share electron pairs).

Based on standard trends (assuming an ordering based on basicity where a stronger base is generally a stronger nucleophile except for steric hindrance):
1. Ethanethiolate should be the strongest due to its charge and high polarizability.
2. Hydroxide should be next since it is a strong base and a small molecule.
3. (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate should be next due to charge, but could be less nucleophilic than hydroxide because of steric hindrance.)
4. Propionate should be less nucleophilic than both hydroxide and 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate because its charge is delocalized ("resonance stability makes the negative charge less concentrated).
5. Methanol should be the poorest nucleophile since it is neutral and thus less reactive compared to negatively charged species.

However, a more accurate order should verify the comparison among OH⁻ and RO⁻ where OH⁻ typically is a slightly stronger nucleophile than most alkoxides due to less steric hindrance. Thus, a reasonable order could be:
$$
\text{Ethanethiolate > Hydroxide > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > Propionate > Methanol}
$$
Checking the choices and validating:
Based on the size and charge distribution:
1. **Ethanethiolate (CH3CH2S⁻) has a negative charge on a sulfur atom which is larger and more polarizable, thus making it the best nucleophile here.
2. **Hydroxide (OH⁻) is a strong nucleophile due to negative charge concentrated on an oxygen atom which is smaller and less polarizable compared to sulfur.
3. **4-Methylcyclohexan-1-olate should be next, but it is bulkier compared to hydroxide so it should be less nucleophilic than hydroxide.
4. **Propionate (CH3CH2COO⁻) should be next in line after 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate due to delocalized charge over two oxygen atoms which makes it a weaker nucleophile.
5. **Methanol (CH3OH) is a neutral molecule and thus should be the weakest nucleophile here.

However, another important part here is that propionate is a weaker base than hydroxide because it is a conjugate base of a carboxylic acid (pKa around 4.87 for propionic acid), while the pKa values for alcohols like methanol is around 15.5. Hence, propionate should be a weaker base (thus likely a weaker nucleophile) compared to methanol if neutral species could be compared this way logically because methanol is a stronger base than its conjugate base should logically be more reactive.

However, a more stringent order could be:
1. **Ethanethiolate (strongest)
2. **Hydroxide (second strongest)
3. **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (should be third strongest because it has a negative charge on an oxygen atom but one that is more sterically hindered compared to OH⁻)
4. **Propionate should be weaker than any of the other negatively charged species because of charge delocalization. However, it should still be a stronger nucleophile than methanol because it has a negative charge.
5. **Methanol should be the weakest one due to the lack of charge.

However, usually, when comparing nucleophilicity, the charge is a major factor so the neutral molecule should indeed be the poorest nucleophile here. 

Thus combining points such as:
1) Bulkiness might make 4-methylcyclohexan-olates weaker than hydroxide.
2) Delocalized charge makes propionate a poorer nucleophile than less sterically hindered alkoxides like hydroxide.

Based on the reasoning above, a well-supported order could be thus hypothesized as:
1. Ethanethiolate
2. Hydroxide
3. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
4. Propionate
5. Methanol

However, another part that might require a double-check is that for a central atom family (i.e., sulfur), for a negatively charged species, the basicity is a factor where a stronger base is usually a stronger nucleophile (although this rule might not hold always). Thus, the pKa of ethanethiol is approximately 11 whereas that of methanol is around 15.5. Thus, ethanethiolate is a stronger base than methoxide ions (underscores that ethanethiol might be a stronger acid than methanol).

So one could argue that ethanethiolate should be a stronger nucleophile as well. 

Another key check shows that the order might be:
1. `Ethanethiolate` (CH3CH2S⁻) is a stronger nucleophile than hydroxide.
2. `Hydroxide` ion should be a stronger nucleophile than `4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate` because the bulky (4-methylcyclohexyl) group makes it slightly less nucleophilic.
3. `4-methylcyclohexan-1-olite` should be a stronger nucleophile than `propionate` because propionate has a delocalized charge.
4. `Propionate` should be a stronger nucleophile than `methanol` because it has a negative charge while methanol is neutral.

Thus:
Ethanethiolate > Hydroxide > 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > Propionate > Methanol

Verifies that ethanethiol indeed has a negative charge on a larger, more polarizable atom making it the strongest nucleophile here. Methanol is indeed the poorest nucleophile because it is neutral and less reactive than negatively charged species.

Conclusion:
The order from the most reactive (best nucleophile) to the poorest reactive (poorest nucleophile) should be outlined as:
5, 2, 1, 3, 4

However, there might be a slight necessity to verify the order of 2 (hydroxide) versus 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate).

Based on the question, the answer should be ordered such that:
The actual order should thus be:
5 (Ethanethiolate) is most reactive, followed by 2 (Hydroxide), or:
1. `5. Ethanethiolate`
2. `2. Hydroxide`
3. `1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate`
4. `3. Propionate`
5. `4. Methanol`

Conversely, we confirm the order based on common nucleophilicity trends in protic solvents where the order might be:
$$
    \text{5, 2, 1, 3, 4}
$$
Seems reasonable thus the answer follows:

#### Highest to lowest nucleophilicity in aqueous solution:
5 (Ethanethiolate) > 2 (Hydroxide) > 1 (4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate) > 3 (Propionate) > 4 (Methanol)

However, let us write down such order explicitly which seems like:
5, 2, 1, 3, 4 

However, a well-established order based on the common nucleophilicity rule in polar protic solvents is usually based on basicity and solvent interaction effects where nucleophilicity should ideally decrease from left to right in the periodic table (i.e., the more easily an atom can donate electrons, the better nucleophilicity it has in general). Another dimension is that the solvation effect makes negatively charged species particularly well solvated in polar protic solvents such that the solvation effect makes smaller anionic species less reactive nucleophiles compared to larger anions where the negative charge is spread out or less solvated.

Because `CH3CH2S⁻` contains sulfur which is larger and thus less solvated in water, it should indeed be the most reactive (strongest nucleophile). 

Next, hydroxide is a stronger nucleophile than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (due to less steric hindrance on hydroxide). Thus:
5. Ethanethiolate > 2. Hydroxide > 1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate > 3. Propionate > 4. Methanol.

However, there is another well-known general ordering for nucleophilicity within anions:

1. In polar aprotic solvents, the order often follows the basicity order (since solvation effects are minimized).
2. In polar protic solvents, bulky anions with a larger size (which make them less solvated) are better nucleophiles.

Thus another way to compare is by using the pKa values of the conjugate acids such that:
    Ethanethiol has a pKa around 10.6 (CH3CH2SH).
    Propionate’s conjugate acid, propionic acid, has a pKa of 4.87.
    Methanol has a pKa of around 15.7.
    The pKa value of cyclohexanol (similar steric structure) is roughly 16.5 (close to that of other alcohols).
    
However, a higher pKa means a weaker acid thus a stronger conjugate base should be a stronger nucleophile if everything else is equal. However, the pKa values indicate that:
Conjugate base strengths:
1. Methanol (CH3OH): pKa ~15.5, so CH3O⁻ is a strong base.
2. 4-Methylcyclohexan-1-ol likely has a pKa similar to methanol or slightly higher (possibly around 16).
3. Ethanethiol (CH3CH2SH) has a pKa ~10.6, so CH3CH2S⁻ is a strong base but less strong than CH3O⁻ or 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
