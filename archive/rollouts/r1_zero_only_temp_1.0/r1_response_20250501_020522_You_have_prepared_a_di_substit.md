To solve for the unknown di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound where the FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, and the 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals described as follows:
    
1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic hydrogen atoms (aromatic-H).
2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl hydrogen atoms (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).
3. Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups.
4. No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups.

First, let's analyze what the given statements imply:
    
1. **Formula Options:**
   - The given molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, and C12H14O2. 

    1. For C11H12O2, the hydrogen deficiency index (degree of unsaturation) is:
    $$
    \text{Degree of unsaturation} = \frac{2 \times 11 + 2 - 12}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6.
    $$
    
    2. For C11H14O2, the degree of unsaturation is:
    $$
    \text{Degree of unsaturation} = \frac{2 \times 11 + 2 - 14}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5.
    $$

    3. For C12H12O2, the degree of unsaturation is:
    $$
    \text{Degree of unsaturation} = \frac{2 \times 12 + 2 - 12}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7.
    $$

    4. For C12H14O2, the degree of unsaturation is:
    $$
    \text{Degree of unsaturation} = \frac{2 \times 12 + 2 - 14}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6.
    $$

2. **FTIR Spectrum Indications:**
    The presence of an ester group implies part of the structure should contain a –COO– group where one part could be part of the aryl ring substitution while another part could be a substituent such as –COOCH3 or a carbon chain.

3. **1H NMR Spectrum Indications:**
    - Two signals for aromatic-H atoms imply there are two types of aromatic protons. This typically means a para-substituted benzene ring where there are two sets magnetically nonequivalent protons (double doublet signals are expected, but the question mentions "two signals" for aromatic-H atoms, so this makes sense for an asymmetrically para-substituted benzene ring (or possibly an ortho-substituted benzene ring where another group might make part of the benzene ring protons equivalent).
    - Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H atoms where one is a doublet and one is a doublet of quartets. This implies that there is a CH=CH group where one of the vinyl protons (an alkene proton bonded to one proton on the adjacent carbon) appears as a doublet due to coupling with one proton (couplings are usually of the form "n+1" where "n" is the number of adjacent protons coupling). Another vinyl proton appears as a doublet of quartets because it couples with one proton on the adjacent carbon (giving a doublet part of the signal) and also couples with three protons from a –CH3 group (giving a quartet part of the signal), thus creating a doublet of quartets.
    - Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. Thus, there are two nonequivalent methyl groups.
    - No signals corresponding to –CH2 groups means that there are no methylene (CH2) groups in the molecule.

Let us reason through what a "doublet of quartets" means for a vinyl proton. A doublet arises due to coupling with one adjacent proton (i.e., one coupling constant J). A doublet of quartets (dq) indicates coupling with one proton (making up the "doublet" part) and three other protons (making up the "quartet" part). Thus, one possible structure fragment might be:
$$
\text{–CH=CH–CH3}.
$$
The –CH part of the –CH=CH– group which is next to CH3 might split into a doublet because of the one proton on the other carbon of the alkene bond (i.e., H–C–CH=CH–CH3, where bold-faced CH splits into a doublet due to coupling with the other CH proton on the alkene). However, this part might also couple with the three protons from the –CH3 group which makes it a quartet. However, that would make an actual quartet signal if the only coupling is with CH3. Here, what we need is a doublet from another coupling such as coupling with one proton (giving a doublet if it is a doublet of quartets). 

However, a doublet of quartets might require a structure like `CH3–CH=CH–` where the first CH proton (directly connected to CH3) could be described thus:
1. Coupling with CH3 produces a quartet (since CH3 has three hydrogen atoms).
2. Another coupling with the other vinyl proton could make that signal split again into a doublet. Thus, the proton adjacent to the CH3 might show a doublet of quartets.

Conversely, the other vinyl proton (next to the carbon only connected to one hydrogen atom) might appear generally as a doublet due to the coupling with the only adjacent proton (on the other carbon of the alkene).

Given that there should be an ester group one part should be –COO–. Possible candidates might be:
1. `CH3–CH=CH–COO–(aromatic ring)`, where the ester could be attached to the benzene ring where the vinyl part is part of the substituent at one of the two substitution positions on the benzene ring (the other substituent could possibly be another CH3 group or part of the other part of the ester connection).

Double-checking the given chemical formulas:
1. Consider C11H12O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 6.
    - A benzene ring itself has an unsaturation degree of 4 (due to one ring and three pi bonds). Thus, for C11H12O2, the remaining part should also contribute two more units of unsaturation (one could be due to the given carbonyl group in the ester and one due to a double bond in the fragment like `–CH=CH–`).
2. C11H14O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 5 which means one less unsaturation than C11H12O2. Here, a benzene ring contributes a degree of unsaturation of 4 (since a benzene ring itself has an unsaturation of 4 — three pi bonds and one ring), leaving one additional unsaturation unit which could be accounted for by an ester group (since a carbonyl group itself counts as one unit of unsaturation).
3. Consider compound C12H12O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 7.
    - A benzene ring itself has an unsaturation of 4; thus, three additional unsaturations could be accounted for by an ester group (1 unit for the carbonyl in the ester) and one unit for an additional double bond such as a `–CH=CH–` group.
4. C12H14O2 has a degree of unsaturation of 6.
    - Similarly, a benzene ring gives us 4 units of unsaturation again, hence the additional unsaturation could be the ester group and one unit remaining could be accounted for by a double bond such as `–CH=CH–`.

Based on the NMR description, a possible candidate molecule could be `CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH3` where `CH3–CH=CH–COO–` is one substituent and `–CH3` is the other substituent on a para-disubstituted benzene ring such as:
$$
CH_3–CH=CH–COO–C_6H_4–CH_3.
$$
However, the question states that there are only two signals for aromatic protons where a para-disubstituted benzene typically has two doublets (which could be interpreted as two signals for two types of aromatic protons). Hence, this appears to make sense structurally where the part after the ester could be a para-substituted benzene ring where there are two types of aromatic protons (thus two signals). 

However, what matters here is identifying the structure based on the given formulas and NMR observations. To make a more conceptual guess, verify the part related to the ester. An ester functionality itself already includes one oxygen bonded to a carbon (`COO` part). Thus, another part of the structure needs to include a part like `–CH=CH–CH3` where:
1. One vinyl hydrogen gives a doublet signal due to coupling with one other nearby proton.
2. Another vinyl-hydrogen splits into a doublet because of the alkene neighbor proton and into a quartet because it should also be coupled to another group that has three protons – hence likely a `CH3` group.

#### Detailed reasoning for a fragment like `CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH3`:
1. The NMR should show signals for aromatic protons which most likely are "two sets of doublets" for para-disubstituted benzene (thus "two signals corresponding to aromatic-H").
2. If `CH3–CH=CH–` is part of the ester, check what the NMR signals look like:
    
    For the fragment `CH3–CH=CH–`, the CH3 protons should give a signal such as a doublet if coupling occurs only with one adjacent proton (assuming a free rotating `–CH3` group would appear as a triplet if it is next to a `CH2` group, but here, since there are no `–CH2` groups, this part makes sense here).
    
    The `CH3–CH=CH–` part may be structured such that:
    - One proton on CH3 splits into a doublet because it is next to the CH part of CH=CH part where only one proton is on the adjacent carbon.
    - However, the proton on the `–CH=CH–` carbon nearest to CH3 should be influenced by two neighbors: the `CH3` (triplet because of coupling with three protons on `CH3`, which makes a part of the signal look like a quartet) and another coupling with another vinyl proton on CH= segment (making it a doublet once again because of coupling with one proton). Thus, a "doublet of quartets".
    
    For the `–CH=CH–` part, the proton on the carbon of the double bond that is not directly bonded to CH3 should split only due to the coupling with the other vinyl proton (hence a doublet should appear here).

However, considering the part `CH3–CH=CH–COO–` will need one part for the ester group such that the compound might be something like:
$$
CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH3
$$

To verify the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in `CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH3`:
$$
\text{(CH3–CH=CH)} + (\text{COO}) + (C6H4) + (\text{</s>CH3}) = C3H5 + C1O2 + C6H4 + CH3 = C11H12O2
$$

Thus, the chemical formula for `CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH3` matches the provided formula $\text{C}_{11}\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_2$, which makes it plausible. 

However, let us verify what other formula might fit for another similar fragment `CH3–CH=CH–`. For the formula `C12H14O2`, another extra carbon and hydrogen are added which might make us need one extra CH2 group. However, the question mentions no signals corresponding to `–CH2`. Thus, if `CH3–CH=CH–` is part of another candidate such as:
$$
\text{(CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH2–CH3)}
$$
The formula would be `C13H16O2` (which is not among the given options).

Another possibility for formula `C12H14O2` may require a molecule such as `CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH=CH3` where `–CH=CH2` is an alternative alkyl substitute for the second part of the ester group would make:
$$
\text{(CH3–CH=CH)} + (\text{COO}) + (C6H4) + (\text{$CH=CH2$}) = C3H5 + C1O2 + C6H4 + C2H3 = C12H14O2
$$
However, the part `–CH=CH2` should bring three vinyl protons where only one would be adjacent to a single hydrogen on the other carbon of the double bond making it a doublet. Another two protons would likely appear separately unless they are diastereotopic and give a more complex signal such as a doublet of doublets (DD). Another candidate could possibly be `CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH(CH3)2`. Another check here is:
$$
\text{(CH3–CH=CH)} + (\text{COO}) + (C6H4) + (CH(CH3)2) = C3H5 + C1O2 + C6H4 + C3H7 = C13H16O2
$$
Which again is not among provided formulas.

Based on the given question description and the reasoning steps taken thus far, the candidate molecular formula appears to be:
$$
\boxed{C_{}}_{11}H_{12}O_{2}}
$$
which fits well with:
$$
CH_3–CH=CH–COO–C_6H_4–CH_3
$$

However, let us make a diagram again for CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH3 and break down the NMR spectrum parts:
1. **Aromatic-H signals:**
    A para-disubstituted benzene ring where one substituent is `–COO–CH=CH–CH3` and another is `–CH3`. Let us label the aromatic ring carbon atom linked to the `–CH3` as position 1 and the one linked to `–COO–CH=CH–CH3` as position 4. Thus, the ring looks like `1-CH3-C$_6$H$_4$-4-COO–CH=CH–CH3`.

Considering symmetry here makes sense for the two signals for aromatic protons because if the two substituents were ortho (1,2 position), there would generally be three signals for aromatic protons; if meta (1,3 position), there would be three signals again. However, a para (1,4 position) substitution seems most likely here.

2. **Vinyl-CH Signals:**
    The part `CH3–CH=CH–COO–` means:
    - The `CH3–` group should show up as a doublet because it has a neighbor CH group where there is only one proton (i.e., `–CH=CH–`).
    - The vinyl group where `CH3–CH=CH–` splits such that:
       - The `–CH=` part next to the ester should appear as a doublet coupling with one proton only (which is the other `–CH=` proton).
       - The `–CH=` part next to the `CH3` should appear as quartet due to coupling with `CH3` protons (3 protons makes a quartet), but here it states "doublet of quartets" which indicates coupling stemming from two parts – once again from coupling with the `CH3` group (making a quartets part) and also coupling with another vinyl proton (making a doublets part).

3. **CH3 Signals:**
    - Two signals for `–CH3`, where one is `CH3` connected to the benzene ring (`–C6H4–CH3`), which should appear as a singlet unless it is a part of a complex structure where it experiences small couplings.
    Another `CH3` connected to `–CH=CH–` part should appear as a doublet due to coupling with the single proton present at the adjacent carbon atom (which makes a doublet unless there is significant rotation making it a bit more complex, but expected as a doublet).

Thus, the structure seems to fit well thus:
1. The part `CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH3` fits all the given observations:

   Based on what we reasoned, `CH3–CH=CH–COO-Ar–CH3` where Ar is para-disubstituted benzene ring makes the reasoning valid. Therefore, the chemical formula appears to be:
$$
\boxed{C_{11}H_{12}O_{2}}.
$$
The compound could be:
$$
\text{methyl acrylate benzyl ester (which seems wrong here, but it makes sense from a fragment part perspective, but should be verified again)}
$$
However probably what is meant here is:
$$
CH_3CH=CHCOOC_6H_4CH_3
$$
Could denote methyl p-tolyl acrylate or an ester where the chain is prop-1-enoate attached to an aryl group where another substituent is a methyl group on another part of the benzene.

However, instead directly `CH3–CH=CH–COO–C6H4–CH3` seems most plausible and fitting structure here could be (1-methyl-4-(propenoate) benzene). Thus, the structure can be visualized as follows:
$$
\text{para-methyl phenyl methacrylate} (\text{methyl acrylate part is $CH_3–CH=CH–COO–$, para position on benzene ring has a $CH_3$}). 
$$
Thus, another way to visualize it might be:
$$
p-\text{methyl acrylate methyl benzene} \text{ where } p\text{-methyl represents the $CH_{3}$ group attached $\textit{para}$ to the acrylate part connected through the ester oxygen}
$$
Similarly, such a compound fits well as follows:
1. The aromatic part has para substitution giving rise to two sets of aromatic protons (2 doublets).
2. Two methyl signals where one is bound to the benzene ring appearing as a singlet and another one bound to the vinyl part (appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the single vinyl proton).
3. Two vinyl signals where one is a doublet (due to coupling with another proton) and another is a quartet (due to coupling with three protons of CH3 but should actually appear as a doublet of doublets where one coupling is with CH3 protons making a quartet, and another with the other proton makes a finer doublet splitting).

For another simple check, let us make a structure such that benzene has both methyl and acrylate groups at para position:
$$
p\text{-methylphenyl acrylate where the structure looks like: } CH_3–C_6H_4–OOC–CH=CH_2
