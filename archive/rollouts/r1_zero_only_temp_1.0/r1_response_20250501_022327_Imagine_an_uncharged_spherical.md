# Original Question

Imagine an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ having a small spherical cavity inside. The centre of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the centre of the spherical conductor. The radius of the cavity is $r$, and $r<R$. Now consider a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is somehow placed somewhere inside the cavity. What is the magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point P (outside the spherical conductor) of distance $L$ from the centre of the spherical conductor? Note, the distance of the point P from the centre of the cavity is $l$. Here, l, L > R. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$

To solve for the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point P outside the spherical conductor where a charge $+q$ is placed inside a spherical cavity (whose center is at a distance $s$ from the center of the spherical conductor), we need to make use of some well-known results from electrostatics including the "superposition principle," "method of images," and "properties of conductors."

### Given:
- An uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$.
- A spherical cavity of radius $r$ whose center is at a distance $s$ from the center of the spherical conductor.
- A positive charge $+q$ is placed somewhere inside the cavity (center of cavity separated from center of spherical conductor by $s$).
- A point P is outside the spherical conductor such that the distances are defined as follows:
    - $L$ is the distance from the center of the spherical conductor to point P.
    - $l$ is the distance from the center of the cavity to point P.
    - The angle between $l$ and $s$ (which is essentially the line joining the center of the spherical conductor to the center of the cavity) is denoted as $\theta$.

It holds that $l, L > R$, which means that point P is outside the spherical conductor. 

Our goal is to find the electric field at point P due to the presence of the charge $+q$ placed inside the cavity.

#### Solution Steps:

1. **Induced Charge Distribution:**
   - When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity (surface of the spherical cavity within the conductor).
   - Since spherical conductor was initially uncharged, a charge $+q$ will appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor such that charge conservation holds for the entire conductor. The total charge on the conductor remains zero (excluding the charge $+q$ which is "external" to the conductor itself), thus if $-q$ is distributed on the inner surface of the cavity, a charge of $+q$ will be distributed uniformly on the outer surface of the spherical conductor such that:
   
$$
(-q)_{\text{inner-surface}} + (+q)_{\text{outer-surface}} = 0.
$$
This means that the net charge on the uncharged spherical conductor itself is zero (which is still true here), but what matters here is how charges are distributed specifically on the inner surface (facing the cavity) and the outer surface (facing the outside world).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Spherical Conductor:**
   - The only electric field contributions at point P (outside the spherical conductor where $L>R$) come from charges either located on the outer surface of the spherical conductor or any external charges. However, here the sole charge described is $+q$ which is inside the cavity which is shielded by the conductor until $+q$ gets distributed such that $+q$ appears on the outer surface of the spherical conductor due to charge conservation.
   - However, the charge $+q$\ placed inside the cavity induces charges such that $+q$ charge uniformly distributes on the outer surface of the conductor (since the total charge on the conductor itself should remain zero until including the induced charges).

3. **Behavior of Electric Field Outside a Charged Spherical Shell:**
   - For a uniformly charged spherical shell (with charge $+q$ uniformly distributed on its surface), the electric field outside the shell behaves as though all the charge $+q$ is concentrated at the center of the shell. Thus, if the charge $+q$ is uniformly distributed across the outer surface of the spherical conductor (whose center is the center of the spherical conductor itself with radius $R$), the electric field at a point $P$ such that $L>R})$ is:
$$
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2} \hat{L}.
$$
   - The direction $\hat{L}$ is a unit vector pointing from the center of the spherical conductor (not the center of the cavity) to the point $P$.

4. **Reasoning for Charge Distribution on Outer Surface:**
  
   To make sure that the charge distribution on the outer surface is indeed uniform:
   Suppose that the charge $+q$ placed somewhere within the cavity induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the cavity such that the total enclosed charge within a Gaussian surface strictly inside the conductor is zero. The charge induced on the inner surface does not need to be uniformly distributed unless the charge $+q$ is exactly at the center of the cavity. However, what does need to be true is that regardless of where $+q$ is placed within the cavity, a total charge of $+q$ must appear on the outer surface of the spherical conductor such that the total charge on the conductor (inner surface charge plus outer surface charge) is still zero.

      Another important fact here is that the charge on the outer surface should be distributed uniformly because:
      - The electric field inside the conductor (excluding the cavity where charge $+q$ is located) is zero.
      - This uniform charge distribution on the outer surface makes the external electric field behave as if there were a charge $q$ located at the center of the sphere (which refers to the center of the spherical conductor, not the center of the cavity).

5. **Conclusion for the Electric Field at Point $P$:**
    - Since the charge on the spherical outer surface is $+q$ distributed uniformly, the electric field at point $P$ such that $L > R$ is thus:
$$
\left|\vec{E}\right| = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
$$
    
This reasoning makes it clear that the electric field at any point outside the spherical conductor only depends on the total charge on the outer surface (which is $q$) and behaves as if the charge $q$ were located at the center of the spherical conductor itself (i.e., the center of the sphere with radius $R$).

#### Verification of Mentioned Points:
- The charge-induced distribution on the inner surface might be non-uniform, depending on the exact position of the $+q$ charge within the cavity and the specific geometric configuration (which indeed matters for the field inside the cavity itself or for the distribution on the inner surface, but not for the field outside the spherical conductor itself).
- However, the only part that matters for the field outside the conductor is the total charge on the outer surface because any charges on inner surfaces do not directly contribute to the electric field outside the conductor.

### Final Expression for the Electric Field Magnitude:

Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field at point $P$ is:
$$
\left|\vec{E}\right| = \frac{q}{4 \pi\varepsilon_0 L^2}.
$$
This is the electric field caused by the $+q$ charge which has been uniformly distributed on the outer surface of the spherical conductor.

### In Terms of Vector Form:
The electric field $\vec{E}$ can be expressed explicitly in vector form as follows:
$$
\vec{E} = \frac{q}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 L^2} \hat{L} = \frac{q \vec{L}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 L^3}.
$$

### Additional Verification (Ensuring Uniform Charge Distribution on Outer Surface):
Another way to show mathematically why the charge distribution on the outer surface is uniform (regardless of the charge $+q$'s exact location within the cavity) relies on the fact that because electric fields inside the conductor should be zero in steady state, the potential on the conductor itself should be constant. Another part that makes this valid is that the spherical conductor itself is symmetric about its own center (though the inner cavity makes the inner surface charge distribution asymmetrical unless $+q$ is at the center of the cavity).

However, what we need here is that once any charge appears on the spherical outer surface (which should be $ +q$), the distribution should be such that any part satisfies electrostatic equilibrium where the conductorâ€™s surface is an equipotential surface -- which makes the charge distribution on the outer surface uniform if the spherical exterior itself is symmetric.

Thus, our reasoning should make us confident that the electric field outside the spherical conductor of radius $R$ where charge $q$ appears uniformly distributed on its outer surface is simply:
$$
\vec{E} = \frac{q}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 L^2} \hat{L}.
$$
