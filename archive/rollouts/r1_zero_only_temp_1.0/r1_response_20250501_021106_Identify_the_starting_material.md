To solve for the starting materials required to synthesize the compound "methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate," we need first to interpret what all parts of the compound's name represent.

The given compound name is:
"methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate"

### Step-by-step breakdown:
1. **"methyl ... carboxylate"** indicates an ester group where the "methyl" part means that the alcohol part of the ester is derived from methanol (CH3OH); thus, the carboxylate part looks like "COOCH3" (where the part "COO" is connected to the rest of the molecule).
    
2. **"2-propyl-"** indicates that there is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3) attached at the carbon atom labeled as "2" on the main structure.
    
3. **"1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene"** indicates the main structure which is an "octahydronaphthalene" core where the "octahydronaphthalene" part indicates that there are 8 hydrogen atoms added to the naphthalene structure (which itself has eight hydrogen atoms on a C10H8 structure). Therefore, "octahydronaphthalene" indicates that the naphthalene structure has been partially saturated such that two of the original double bonds (which makes the total carbon count C10H8 for naphthalene) are now single bonds such that the compound now has the molecular formula following an addition of four hydrogen atoms (typically C10H16).

However, a "naphthalene" skeleton consists of two fused benzene rings (total of 10 carbon atoms and originally has four double bonds). "Octahydronaphthalene" means that the naphthalene has been reduced so that only one double bond remains (since hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms for every double bond that is saturated, thus "octahydronaphthalene" generally means that out of the naphthalene structure (which has a formula of C10H8 where there are [10 - 8]/2 = 5 double bonds), some double bonds have been saturated such that the formula becomes C10H16 which means that only one double bond might remain (since C10H8 has formula CnH2n-12 where n=10, while C10H16 has a formula CnH2n-4 where n=10, which indicates that there could still be two double bonds or a remaining ring structure).

A decalin (decahydronaphthalene) structure is completely saturated and has the formula C10H18. Thus, octahydronaphthalene should contain one extra double bond compared to decahydronaphthalene. Thus, the "8,9-double bond" seems to be the only one that makes sense here based on what "octahydronaphthalene" usually refers to.

### To construct "2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate" explicitly:
The name "methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate" thus should be interpreted further:
    
    -The main part of the molecule consists of an octahydronaphthalene (which means a bicyclic compound where one ring might still contain a double bond).
    -There is a propyl group attached to the second carbon of the octahydronaphthalene part.
    -There is a carboxylic acid turned into a methyl ester ("methyl carboxylate") attached to the first carbon of the same octahydronaphthalene part.
    
This means:
$$ \text{methyl (2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate)}$$
which has a part like:
$$ \text{(2-CH3CH2CH2-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene)-1-COOCH3}$$

Based on the question's instructions, an appropriate reaction that could lead to such a compound is typically a Diels-Alder reaction where a diene reacts with a dienophile. Given the name "methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate," we need a diene and a dienophile such that upon cycloaddition, they form a 1,2-disubstituted octahydronaphthalene where one of the substituents is a propyl group at carbon 2 and a methyl carboxylate group at carbon 1.

### Structural determination:
Let us try to identify the actual skeleton first. An octahydronaphthalene part with a structure such that carbons have been labeled as follows:
1. "1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a" indicates that the only carbon not explicitly numbered here is carbon number 3 and carbon number 4 (which might be part of the fused rings where carbons 4a and 8a bridge the two saturated rings).
Thus, the octahydronaphthalene has two cyclic rings fused together where one ring might be six-membered and the remaining part another six-membered ring where some specific carbons are numbered explicitly as in:

![octahydronaphthalene skeleton](https://www.chemspider.com/ImagesHandler.ashx?id=4475586&w=250&h=250)

However, a structure typically referred to as octahydronaphthalene has a bicyclic structure such that:
$$
\mathrm{C_1 - C_{2} - C_{3} - C_{4} - C_{4a} - C_{10} (8a)}\\
\mathrm{(first ring is fused to another six-membered ring where carbon 9 might be denoted as connected to C_{8} and C_{1})} \\
\mathrm{C_{5} - C_{6} - C_{7} - C_{8} - C_{8a} - C_{4a}}}
$$
This seems a bit complex, so let us make a more specific structure conforming to the question requirements. 

The compound looks like "2-propyl-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate." Another part worth mentioning is that the stereochemistry is not specified here so any stereochemistry might be valid unless "cis" or "trans" is mentioned explicitly. Another part is that the question might be asking for a one-step reaction where two fragments make up the desired compound through a Diels-Alder reaction.

### Diels-Alder reaction requires a diene (which has conjugated double bonds separated by a single bond) and a dienophile which has a double bond that reacts with the diene to form a ring structure. 

Based on the structure of the target compound "methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate," let us build the target molecule systematically:

1. The parent structure is octahydronaphthalene which means decalin (decahydronaphthalene) with two hydrogen atoms less (thus still one double bond). To make a bicyclic structure such as octahydronaphthalene, a common Diels-Alder reaction uses cyclohexadiene as the diene and a suitable dienophile with appropriate substituents such that after cycloaddition followed by any necessary reduction step might make the target molecule.

2. To make a bicyclic compound structured like "2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate" via a Diels-Alder reaction where "2-propyl" indicates a propyl group attached at carbon 2 position and "1-carboxylate" indicating a methyl ester attached at carbon 1 position, this suggests that the diene should probably be a cyclohexadiene where carbon 1 and 2 (as carbon labels might be reassigned post-reaction) are available for substituents derived from the dienophile, where the dienophile should contain a propyl group and a methyl carboxylate group whose carbon backbone becomes carbon 1 and 2 of the octahydronaphthalene part.

#### A suitable diene looks like "$1,3$-cyclohexadiene," which has a structure like:
$$
\mathrm{H_2C=CH-CH=CH-CH_2-CH_2}
$$
#### The dienophile needs:
To place a "methyl carboxylate" (CH3OCO) at position 1 and a propyl group (CH3CH2CH2) at position 2 (once the Diels-Alder reaction occurs). Thus, a dienophile such as a substituted alkene where one carbon has a "methyl carboxylate" group while the other carbon has a "propyl group" could be:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2-CH=CH-COOCH_3}
$$
This molecule is called "methyl 2-pentenoate" where:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2-CH=CH-COOCH_3} \text{(which could be either the E or Z isomer, although typically Diels-Alder reactions are stereospecific where the stereochemistry of the dienophile is preserved in the product's geometry.)}
$$
However, a commonly used dienophile structure for such a reaction might further be verified by explicitly drawing out the reaction:

### Reaction Analysis:
To make sure everything makes sense, let us dissect what happens when $1,3$-cyclohexadiene reacts with methyl 2-pentenoate where methyl 2-pentenoate is specifically written as:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-CH=CH(COOH)-O-CH_3}
$$
(which should be written properly as $\mathrm{CH_3OOC-CH=CH-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3}$).

However, the specific name "methyl 2-pentenoate" might be a bit confusing here because "2-pentenoate" usually refers to a structure such as $\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-CH=CH-COOCH_3}$, while "4-pentenoate" would typically be referred to as $\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-COOCH_3}$. However, what we need here is possibly a "3-pentenoate":
$\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH=CHCOOCH_3}$, which is "methyl 3-pentenoate." 

However, the given structure mentioned appears to be:
$$
\mathrm{methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate}
$$

However, a "1-carboxylate" indicates that the carboxylic acid has been esterified with a methyl group and thus we need a diene and a dienophile where the dienophile should contain a double bond where one carbon has a propyl group attached and the other carbon has a functional group that eventually ends up as a methyl carboxylate (COOCH3).

### Another possible way to verify through reverse Diels-Alder analysis:

Another part that makes sense here could be this:
- To make a compound such that it has a propyl group at carbon 2 and a carboxylate group at carbon 1 (with a methyl ester), a plausible precursor could be a diene of cyclic nature such as cyclohexadiene and a dienophile where one end should have a CH3OCO- (methyl carboxylate) group attached while the other end has a CH3CH2CH2- (propyl group):

Therefore, we need a diene such as "1,3-cyclohexadiene" (thus, a cyclic diene) and a dienophile such as:
$$
\text{methyl acrylates with a propyl group at the other end might fit as well.}
$$
Let us make sure we make a drawing for a clear picture.

To make "methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate", draw the structures.

1. **1,3-cyclohexadiene** as diene:
$$
\ce{C_6H_8} \text{ structure where one ring has two double bonds (double bonds at 1,3 position in a 6-membered ring)}.
$$
2. For the dienophile, to make up the "2-propyl-1-carboyloyate" part:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2-CH=CH-COOCH_3} =\alpha,\beta-\text{Unsaturated ester where the propyl group might be on the β carbon if you count from the carboxylate carbon.}
$$
Again, let us call it "methyl 3-pentenoate" instead of "2-pentenoate" because:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2-CH=CH-COOCH_3}
$$

#### Reaction mechanism sketch:

1. The diene part could be "1,3-cyclohexadiene":
$$\ce{C6H8 ->[1,3-cyclohexadiene] CH2=CH-CH=CH-CH2-CH2}$$
2. The dienophile should bear a $\text{propyl}$ group and a $\text{COOCH3}$ group (where the double bond remains between the carbon bonded to the propyl group and the carbon bonded to the COOCH3 group). 

This makes "3-pentenoic acid methyl ester" (methyl-3-pentenoate) seem like a candidate:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2-CH=CH-COOCH_3}.
$$

Thus, if the reaction were:
$$
\ce{1,3-cyclohexadiene} + \mathrm{Methyl 3-pentenoate} \rightarrow \text{methyl 2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate}
$$
To draw the structures here might help us understand what results from such a reaction:

But, the reaction should make sure that the carbon leading to the carboxyl ester group must end up at position 1 and the propyl-containing carbon should end up at carbon 2 on the octahydronaphthalene ring formed (part of the reaction results in a bicyclic structure).

Based on the Diels-Adler reaction:

1.1 Combinations could yield a bicyclic structure where methyl carboxylate is on carbon 1 and the propyl is on carbon 2 position.

Thus, our reasoning leads us to the following starting materials:
1) **1,3-cyclohexadiene**: $\ce{C6H8}$ (diene).
2) **Methyl 3-pentenoate**: $\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH_2-CH=CH-COOCH_3}$ (dienophile).

However, if you verify the product from the specified reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and methyl 3-pentenoate through Diels-Alder reaction:
$$
\ce{1,3-cyclohexadiene + Methyl 3-pentenoate -> methyl 2-propyl-7,8-dihydro-1,2,4a,5,6,8a-hexahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate}
$$
only one double bond remains in the product which makes sense because the reaction product itself should still have two double bonds from the naphthalene structure which were only partially hydrogenated such that one bond remains in fully octahydronaphthalene.

Thus, once again verifying using chemical structures:

1.3-cyclohexadiene is:
$$
\ce{(CH2=CH-CH=CH-CH2-CH2)}
$$
And the dienophile can be:
$$
\ce{CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3}
$$
The reaction between them should make a compound such that the dienophile adds across the "1" and "4" carbons of the diene such that the two carbons of the dienophile become attached at carbon 1 and 2 of the new cyclohexane ring formed within the bicyclic compound. 

Based on this, it looks like a Diels-Alder reaction makes a bridgehead compound where the methyl carboxylate group is at carbon position 1 and the propyl group is at carbon 2 of one of the rings from the bicyclic structure formed. Thus, once the reaction occurs, another round of hydrogenation might be performed to make the octahydro part if needed.

However, what seems to make the most sense here would be drawing the final molecule first and then retrosynthetically break it down.

To summarize, the answer seems to be:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\text{Diene: } \text{1,3-cyclohexadiene} \\
\text{Dienophile: } \text{methyl 2-pentenoate} \text{(specifically should be CH3CH2CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3 which seems valid)}
\end{array}
\]

However, a closer drawing check shows that the name itself "methyl -propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate" does imply some remaining double bond which makes us question if the product from the Diels-Alder reaction already has saturated rings such that only one double bond might remain where clearly octahydronaphthalene already has a certain structure:

You need to verify what the "2-propyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylate" structure looks like. Let's represent "octahydronaphthalene" first:
This is decahydronaphthalene with one extra double bond. Thus, a product such as:

#### Structure drawing should be verified explicitly.

Nevertheless, an alternative well-known synthesis strategy for this kind of bicyclic structure often uses some variation of a Diels-Alder reaction where the 1,3-cyclohexadiene reacts with a substituted dienophile such as:
$$
\mathrm{1,3-cyclohexadiene + CH_3CH_2CH_2-CH=CH-COOCH_3}
$$
After the Diels-Alder reaction, if any additional hydrogenation steps are needed, one should verify it with a full chemical structure drawing.

Hence, the question requires us to identify starting materials that could lead
