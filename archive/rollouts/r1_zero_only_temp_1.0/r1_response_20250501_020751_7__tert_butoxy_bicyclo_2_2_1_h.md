To solve for the question about the reactions described, let us first identify each step and deduce the structures formed at each stage until we arrive at the final product "4."

### Step 1: Reaction involving 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene with sodium iodide at elevated temperature forming product "1".

#### Initial reactant structures:

1. **7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene**

    The structure of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene consists of a bicyclic system where "bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta" indicates a "norbornene" structure (a bicyclic structure with a "2 carbon bridge" and a "1 carbon bridge" across a 7-carbon system where there are double bonds at positions 2 and 5, making it a "bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene".

    The "7-(tert-butoxy)" part indicates that there is a tert-butoxy group (tert-butyl group bonded to an oxygen which is itself bonded to the bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene structure at the 7 position (bridgehead carbon opposite the one-carbon bridge). Thus, the reactant has the following skeleton where the "7" position is the carbon atom opposite the one-carbon bridge, so the structure can be represented as follows:
    
    ![7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene](https://i.imgur.com/r4CJ73X.png)

    Another way to interpret the "7" position is to recall that the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane includes a carbon bridgehead at positions 1 and 4 where carbon 1 is connected to carbon 7 through a methylene bridge (2 carbon bridge) and carbon 4 is connected to carbon 7 through a direct bridge (1 carbon bridge).

2. **5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene**

    This refers to a cyclohexa-1,3-diene (i.e., a cyclohexene ring harboring two double bonds at positions 1, and 3 such that the carbons involved are C1=C2 and C3=C4). The "5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)" part means that there are two "dibromomethyl" groups attached to carbons 5 and 6 of the cyclohexa-1,3-diene structure where dibromomethyl indicates a CHBr2 group. Hence see the structure:
    
    $$
    \text{Cyclohexa-1,3-diene with CHBr2 groups attached to positions 5 and 6: }
    \begin{pmatrix}& \stackrel{5}{\text{CHBr2}} - \text{C} & \\
& |\\
\text{CH}_2\text{Br}_2-C_5\text{C}_6\text{-CH}_2\text{Br}_2 - \text{C} & -\text{C} = \text{C} - \text{C} = \text{C} - \text{C} & \\
& \text{6} & & & &1 & &2 & 3 & &4
\end{pmatrix}
    $$

    
The reaction mentions that there are "two equivalents" of the 5, resonator is treated alongside "sodium iodide" at "elevated temperature." NaCl is a source of I- ions which can act as a nucleophile and facilitate the reduction reaction where Br can be replaced by I (also known as Finkelstein reaction). However, sodium iodide is also known to convert dibromomethylene compounds (such as CH2Br2) into carbenes (like CH2) through alpha elimination or dehydrohalogenation which can react further.

However, a well-known reaction where sodium iodide acts as a reducing agent is the formation of a carbenoid where dibromomethyl groups (CHBr2) might be converted into a carbene (CH:).

Upon reaction with sodium iodide at elevated temperature, a single dibromomethyl group (typically CHBr2 → CHBr2 + 2NaI → CHI2 + 2NaBr → might continue forming CHBrI or carbene upon further reaction). Another plausible reaction here might be that the double dibromomethyl groups (CHBr2) could turn into dibromocarbenes (CBr2 species):

$$
\text{CHBr2 groups might be converting to highly reactive "carbene" counterparts such as} : \text{CBr2} \\
\text{possibly leading to a reaction such as} : \text{CBr2 + alkene turns into cyclopropane ring}.
$$
    
However, the reagent 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene already has four bromine atoms distributed symmetrically over carbons 5 and 6 as two CHBr2 groups attached to those carbons. 

However, for treating one equivalent of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene under NaI makes us wonder about an existing known reaction called the Doering–LaFlamme reaction wherein a diiodomethane equivalent reacts forming a cyclopropanation reaction which does reflect well here if dibromocarbene is formed instead here because dibromocarbenes can similarly add across double bonds to form dibromocyclopropane derivatives.

That means:
    
    Product "1" likely results from double cyclopropanation adding two cyclobutane like segments formed from another two double bonds reacting with the generated carbene. Draw the 7-(tert-butокси bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (maintaining its two double bonds which might partake in cyclopropanation via probable carbene insertions from dibromocarbenes derived from the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene).

However, the step should specifically identify what is happening explicitly. 

Considering that one mole of the first reagent reacts with two moles of our "second" reactant one feasible reaction which might occur is that the dibromomethyl groups get activated possibly into dibromomethylenes which attack the bicyclic compound at double bond Carbon atoms giving something like a double cyclopropanation. 

#### Verification with reactions indeed confirms that multiple carbenes are involved here where generated dibromocarbenes can add to the two double bonds.

Let us break down the generation of carbenes potentially here：
$$
R-Br + NaI \rightarrow R-I + NaBr \\
CHBr3 + 3NaI \rightarrow CHI3 + 3NaBr
$$
Perhaps the same happens with:
$$
CHBr2-CH2Br + 3KI \rightarrow CHBr2-CH2I + 3KBr \\
\text{But also possible with dibromomethyl groups converting to carbenoid species}.
$$
Thus产品 product "1" is probably a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-like structure wherein the two double bonds have reacted with two equivalents of carbenes generated from 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclochlorhexa-1,3-diene. 

### Step 2: Product "1" is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid forming product "2."

Guide and acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of tert-butoxy group which commonly leads to the formation of an alcohol by removing the tert-butyl group:
$$
\text{R-OC(CH}_3\text{)}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{H}^+} \text{ROH} + \text{(CH}_3\text{)}_3\text{COH}.
$$
Thus product "2" probably has a "H" in place of the tert-butyl group (i.e., an "OH" group instead食物的 of the "O-tert-butyl" group here).

### Step 3: Product مسئول在国内 "2" is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO forming product "3."

The SO3/pyridine加 DMSO complex typically acts as a sulfating agent for alcohols, "2" likely has an alcohol group which will modified by SO3/pyridine complex:
$$
\text{R-OH} + \text{SO3-pyridine complex} \rightarrow \text{R-OSO3H}.
$$
With generally "sulfating" the alcohol机 making it into a good最初的离去磺酸酯 group that could leave easily allowing for further rearrangements or eliminations.

### Step 4: Heating product "3" at 150°C forming final product "4."

Heating sulfated product "3" article might计划 eliminate the OSO3H group forming double bond if your读书 arose from an elimination reaction forming a highly reactive intermediates possibly leading to a final aromatic product such as benzene derivative or another stable compound linear.

Let us now bring it all together step-step-by-step.
