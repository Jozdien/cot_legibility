# Original Question

We have a solution which has the volume of 200.00 cm3 and contains 1.00 g KH2PO4 (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) (T = 25 °C). What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution? The Ka1, Ka2 and Ka3 values for H3PO4 are 7.5x10^-3, 6.2x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-12, respectively.

To solve for the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution given the composition (1.00 g KH2PO4 and 1.00 g Na2HPO4●2H2O dissolved in a total volume of 200.00 cm3), we need to recognize what "orthophosphate ions" refers to. Orthophosphate (PO43−) refers to any species originating from H3PO4 such as H3PO4, H2PO4−, HPO42−, and PO43− (however, "orthophosphate" usually refers collectively to phosphate species formed from H3PO4, including all its dissociation states mentioned).

However, what the question is probably asking us for is the total concentration of all phosphate species derived from H3PO4 in the solution which could be denoted as the "total phosphate concentration" ([Total P]). This includes the species H3PO4, H2PO4−, HPO42−, and PO43−. However, another part of the question provides us the dissociation constants Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4:

$$
H_3PO_4 \underset{K_{a1}}{\rightleftharpoons} H^+ + H_2PO_4^- \text{ where } K_{a1} = 7.5 \times 10^{-3} \\
H_2PO_4^- \underset{K_{a2}}{\rightleftharpoons} H^+ + HPO_4^{2-} \text{ where } K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \\
HPO_4^{2-} \underset{K_{a3}}{\rightleftharpoons} H^+ + PO_4^{3-} \text{ where } K_{a3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
$$
However, normally the term "orthophosphate" here should be interpreted as the sum of all phosphate species derived from the phosphate added to the solution (i.e., [Total P] = [H3PO4] + [H2PO4−] + [HPO42−] + [PO43−]).

To find the total phosphate concentration in the solution, we need to first determine the molar amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O:
1. We need to calculate the molar amounts for KH2PO4:
$$
\text{Moles of KH2PO4} = \frac{\text{mass of KH2PO4}}{\text{molecular weight of KH2PO4}} = \frac{1.00 \text{ g}}{136.09 \text{ g/mol}} \approx \frac{1.00}{136.09} \text{ mol} \\
\approx 0.0073477 \text{ mol}.
$$
2. Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O:
$$
\text{Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O} = \frac{\text{mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O}}{\text{molecular weight of Na2HPO4·2H2O}} = \frac{1.00\text{ g}}{177.99 \text{ g/mol}} \\
\approx \frac{1.00}{177.99} \text{ mol} \approx 0.0056183 \text{ mol }. 
$$
Total molar quantities therefore are roughly:
$$
n_{\text{total phosphate}} = \text{moles of KH2PO4} + \text{moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O} \\
n_{\text{total phosphate}} = 0.0073477 + 0.0056183 \text{ mol} \approx 0.0129660 \text{ mol}.
$$
We need total moles of phosphate from both sources because once they dissolve in water, the KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4−, while Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO42−. 

Total phosphate species here include H3PO4, H2PO4−, HPO42−, and PO43−. However, the amounts of H2PO4− initially provided by KH2PO4 is already known as 0.0073477 mol and HPO42− initially provided by Na2HPO4·2H2O is 0.0056183 mol. 

Total moles of phosphate initially are summed for all phosphate species here but once in solution, equilibrium reactions will redistribute the species among H3PO4, H2PO4−, HPO42− and PO43−. Hence, what we need above is indeed the total phosphate species added irrespective of their forms once they dissolve into the solution and reach equilibrium.

Total phosphate concentration in a 200 cm3 (or 0.200 L) solution volume:
$$
\text{Total phosphate concentration} = \frac{n_{\text{total phosphate}}}{\text{volume in liters}} = \frac{0.0129660 \text{ mol}}{0.200 \text{ L}} = 0.06483 \textrm{ M} \text{ (approximately)}.
$$
However, to verify if this makes sense given the Ka values such that there could be a prominent species:
1. For KH2PO4 which dissociates as:
$$
\mathrm{KH2PO4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{K^{+}} + \mathrm{H2PO4^{-}}.
$$
2. For Na2HPO4·2H2O which dissociates as:
$$
\mathrm{Na2HPO4·2H2O} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na^{+}} + \mathrm{HPO4^{2-}} + 2\mathrm{H2O} \text{ (typically, the water does not contribute substantially to the main reaction)}.
$$
However, solving explicitly might require us to make a more complex equilibrium analysis where H2PO4− can either lose another proton to make HPO42− or gain a proton to make H3PO4. Meanwhile, HPO42− can either lose a proton to make PO43− or gain a proton to make H2PO4−. 

To make such calculations, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be used generally for a buffer made from a mixture of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ ions. However, what matters here might be what the resulting pH of the mixture is so that you understand what the predominate species becomes:

First, let us assume that most of the phosphate exists in forms such as H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ until buffered at a pH close to $\mathrm{p}K_{a2}$. 

Initially:
$$
[KH_2PO_4] = \frac{ 0.0073477 }{0.2} = 0.0367385 \text{ M}\\
[Na_2HPO_4] = \frac{0.0056183}{0.2} = 0.0280915 \text{ M}.
$$
This makes an approximate buffer made from H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ species where KH2PO4 acts predominantly as a source of H2PO4⁻ and Na2HPO4 acts as a source of HPO4²⁻. Thus, initial concentrations would roughly be:
$$
[H_2PO_4^-] \approx (\text{if solely from KH2PO4}) \sim 0.0367385 \text{ M}\\
[HPO_4^{2-}] \sim 0.0280915 \text{ M}.
$$

However, to find out the pH of this buffer solution using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
$$
\mathrm{pKa_2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208.
$$
Thus:
$$
\mathrm{pH} = \mathrm{p}K_{a2} + \log \frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}
$$
where $pKa_2 = 7.208$, $[HPO_4^{2-}] = 0.0280915$, and $[H_2PO_4^-] = 0.0367385$:
$$
\mathrm{pH} \approx 7.208 + \log \left(\frac{0.0280915}{0.0367385}\right) \approx 7.208 + \log (0.7646) \\
\approx 7.208 - 0.1165 \\
\approx 7.0915.
$$
Using this pH, here's what equilibria look like among various phosphate species:

Total phosphate total concentration was previously computed as following:
$$
\text{[Total phosphate]} = [H_3PO_4] + [H_2PO_4^-] + [HPO_4^{2-}] + [PO_4^{3-}],
$$
which can be calculated directly from the total phosphorus originally dissolved into the solution regardless of the form:
$$
\text{[Total phosphate]} = \frac{0.0129660 \text{ mol}}{0.200 \text{ L}} \approx 0.06483 \text{ M}.
$$
This concentration refers to total phosphate species (excluding any hydrolysis reaction which could convert orthophosphates into pyrophosphates, which seems unlikely here).

Another expression for total phosphate species is:
$$
\text{[Total phosphate]} = [H_3PO_4] + [H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}] + [HPO_4^{2-}] + [PO_4^{3-}].
$$
Total moles of phosphate from both salts should equal the total moles of phosphate from all species:
$$
(1)\ \ [H_3PO_4] + [H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}] + [HPO_4^{2-}] + [PO_4^{3-}] = 0.06483 .
$$
Another important equation is mass balance:
$$
[K^+] = 0.0073477 / 0.200 = 0.03674 \text{ M} \\
[Na^+] = 2 \times 0.0056183 / 0.200 = 0.05618 \text{ M}
$$
However charge balance could be written explicitly as:
$$
[K^+] + [Na^+] + [H^+] = [H_2PO_4^-] + 2[HPO_4^{2-}] + 3[PO_4^{3-}] + [OH^-].
$$
However, sometimes charge balance may make the problem a lot harder. Working from the initial salt descriptions may be simpler here.

Instead, for now assume:
In a buffered solution which might still retain major species of $H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}$ or $HPO_4^{2-}$ such that:
$$
\text{if } [H_{2}PO_{4}^{-}] \text{ and } [HPO_4^{2-}] \approx \text{initial input species.}
$$
However, throughout the problem, utilization of Ka values for H3PO4 may require us to identify the proportion of various phosphorus species present in the solution based on the calculated pH which is around 7.0915.

We need to identify what [H3PO4], [H2PO4−], [HPO42−], and [PO43−] are individually. Given this:
$$
\mathrm{pH} = 7.0915, \text{ which corresponds to } [H^+] = 10^{-7.0915} \simeq 8.1 \times 10^{-8} \\
[H^+] = 8.1 \times 10^{-8}.
$$
This makes us recall relations from dissociation constants:
$$
K_{a1} = \frac{[H^+][H_2PO_4^-]}{[H_3PO_4]},
$$
$$
\Rightarrow [H_3PO_4] = \frac{[H^+][H_2PO_4^-]}{K_{a1}}.
$$
And similarly:
$$
K_{a2} = \frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]},
$$
$$
\Rightarrow [H_2PO_4^-] = \frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{K_{a2}}.
$$
And:
$$
K_{a3} = \frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]},
$$
$$
\rightarrow [HPO_4^{2-}] = \frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{K_{a3}}.
$$
We need to express the total phosphate concentration explicitly in terms of a single species so that we can solve for its total sum components effectively. To make a connection, we write down the fraction calculations for various phosphate species. With us having $[H^+]$, how about we solve proportion equations for the fractions of phosphate species.

$$
\text{Total phosphate concentration} = [H_3PO_4] + [H_2PO_4^-] + [HPO_4^{2-}] + [PO_4^{3-}].
$$
Thus, fractional parts are given by formulae called "alpha coefficients" used frequently for polyprotic acids like:
$$
\delta_0 = \frac{[H_3PO_4]}{[Total \ P]} = \frac{[H^+]^3}{[H^+]^3 + K_{a1}[H^+]^2 + K_{a1}K_{a2}[H^+] + K_{a1}K_{a2}K_{a3}},
\\
\delta_1 = \frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[Total \ P]} = \frac{K_{a1}[H^+]^2}{[H^+]^3 + K_{a1}[H^+]^2 + K_{a1}K_{a2}[H^+] + K_{a1}K_{a2}K_{a3}},
\\
\delta_2 = \frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[Total \ P]} = \frac{K_{a1}K_{a2}[H^+]}{[H^+]^3 + K_{a1}[H^+]^2 + K_{a1}K_{a2}[H^+] + K_{a1}K_{a2}K_{a3}},
\\
\delta_3 = \frac{[PO_4^{3-}]}{[Total \ P]} = \frac{K_{a1}K_{a2}K_{a3}}{[H^+]^3 + K_{a1}[H^+]^2 + K_{a1}K_{a2}[H^{] + K_{a1}K_{a2}K_{a3}}}
$$
However since we already found that [Total P] = 0.06483 M, what matters for us is $[Total P] \times \delta_3$, which provides us a direct route to solve for $[PO_4^{3-}]$. However, what seems reasonable here is that $[PO_4^{3-}]$ is generally very small due to $K_{a3}$ having a very low value such that $[PO_4^{3-}]$ should typically be negligible if compared against $[H_2PO_4^-]$ and $[HPO_4^{2-}]$ at a pH around 7.

However, verifying what exactly parts such formulas should look like for appropriate quantities when solved explicitly works like:
Denominator for $\delta$ values:
$$
D = [H^+]^3 + K_{a1}[H^+]^2 + K_{a1}K_{a2}[H^+] + K_{a1}KI_{a2}K_{a3}.
$$
Utilize $Ka_1 = 7.5 \times 10^{-3}$, $Ka_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}$, $Ka_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}$ and $[H^+] \approx 8.1 \times 10^{-8}$.
$$
D=[H^+]^3 + (7.5 \times 10^{-3})[H^+]^2 + (7.5 \times 10^{-3} \times 6.2 \times 10^{-8})[H^+] + (7.5 \times 10^{-3})(6.2 \times 10^{-8})(1.8 \times 10^{-12}),\\
=(8.1 \times 10^{-8})^3 + (7.5 \times 10^{-3}) \times (8.1 \times 10^{-8})^2 + (7.5)}{ \times 10^{-3} \times 6.2 \times 10^{-8}}{ \times 8.1 \times 10^{-8}} + 8.37 \times 10^{-22} \\
=(8.1 \times 10^{-8})^3 \stackrel{\text{(very small)}}{\approx} 5.3 \times 10^{-22} + \\
(7.5 \times 10^{-3})(8.1 \times 10^{-8})^2 \approx 4.92 \times 10^{-17} + \\
(7.5 \times10^{-3})(6.2 \times 10^{-8})(8.1 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 3.76 \times 10^{-17} + \\
8.37 \times 10^{-22}.
$$
Comparing these terms individually:
$$
= 5.3!\timesice10^{-22} + 4.92 \times 10^{-17} + 3.76 \times 10^{-17} + 8.37 \times 10^{-22}.
$$
We see obedience that $4.92 \times 10^{-17}$戮 appleand $3.76 \处事10^{-17}$烷.\ are the largest components here because terms involving $[H^+]^3$公 andanny $K_{a1}K_{有個a2}K_{a3}$剃 are乐negligible compared映射 to灭菌components containingimension有多少 $K_{a1}[H咀嚼^+]^2$焊 and磁 $K_{a算子進攻1}K_{a推论2][H挥舞^{+}]$次:
Hence:
$$

$$
Then let Us individual飞proportion coefficients:
$$
\delta_0 = \frac{[H^+]^3}{D};\ \delta_0 = \frac{(8.1 \times 10^{-8})^3}{8.68 \times 10^{-17}}.\\
\delta_0 \approx \frac{5.314 \times 10^(-22)}{8.68 \times 10^{-17}} \approx 6.12 \times 10^{-6}.
