To resolve two quantum states with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ having lifetimes of $10^{-9}$ seconds and $10^{-8}$ seconds, respectively, we need to make sure that the "linewidths" associated with the energy states are such that there is a clear distinction between the two energy levels $E_1$ and $E_2$. 

The "linewidth" of an energy state is typically related to the uncertainty principle, which states that:
$$
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
$$
Here, $\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in the energy (which translates to the "linewidth" of the energy state), $\Delta t$ represents the lifetime of the state, and $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$, where $h$ is Planck’s constant ($h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}$). Thus:
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t}.
$$
In this question, the lifetimes $\Delta t_1$ and $\Delta t_2$ for the two quantum states are:
$$
\Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{sec},\\
\Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{sec}.
$$
For the first state (with lifetime $10^{-9}$ seconds):
$$
\Delta E_1 \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_1} = \frac{\hbar}{2 \times 10^{-9}}.
$$
We similarly solve for the second state (with lifetime $10^{-8}$ seconds):
$$
\Delta E_2 \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta t_2} = \frac{\hbar}{2 \times 10^{-8}}.
$$
Since $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$, where $h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}$,
$$
\hbar \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2\pi}\; \text{Js} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{Js}.
$$

To solve numerically for $\Delta E_1$:
$$
\Delta E_1 = \frac{1.054 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \text{Js} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J}.
$$
Similarly for $\Delta E_2$:
$$
\Delta E_2 = \frac{1.054 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \text{Js} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \text{ J}.
$$
However, a more common unit for such energy differences in quantum mechanics is the eV ($ 1 \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$). Thus, converting:
$$
\delta E_J = \delta E_{eV} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19},
$$
so:
$$
\delta E_{eV} = \frac{\delta E_J}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}.
$$
Hence:
$$
\Delta E_1 \text{(in eV)} = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}.
$$
And similarly for:
$$
\Delta E_\n2 \text{(in eV)} = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-8} \text{eV}.
$$

However, an easier way to remember a useful relation for quick calculations is:
$$
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \hbar / 2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2} \text{ (for a round value approximation, actually } \Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \text{ however, a common approximation used is } \Delta E \Delta t \approx \hbar \text{ or } \Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t} \text{ due to the order of magnitude estimations).
}
$$
Thus:
similar to the above reasoning here is a round figure calculation where we naively round off $\hbar$ as $10^{-34} \, \text{Js}$. Thus:
$$
\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{10^{-34}}{2}.
$$
For $\Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s}$:
$$
\Delta E_1 \geq \frac{10^{-34}}{2} \times \frac{1}{10^{-9}} = \frac{10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J}.
$$
For $\Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s}$:
$$
\Delta E_2 \geq \frac{10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5 \times 10^{-27} \text{ J}.
$$

For us to clearly resolve the two energy levels $E_1$ and $E_2$, the "linewidths" should be such that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the "linewidths" $\Delta E_1$ and $\Delta E_2$. 

However, resolving two energy levels requires that the "energy difference" between $E_1$ and $E_2$ should be larger than the "energy uncertainties" (linewidths) of both states. Another way to think about it is that the linewidths should not make the peaks (of energy levels) overlap significantly. 

This means:
$$
|E_1 - E_2| > \frac{\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2}{2}.
$$
However, a more conservative and common way to make sure two peaks are resolved is by using the full widths at half-maximum (FWHM). However usually the "linewidth" given by $\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}$ (where $\tau$ is the lifetime) gives the "natural linewidth" which is roughly the FWHM. 

Hence, the "linewidths" sum should ideally be less than the energy difference $|E_2 - E_1|$, so:
$$
|E_1 - E_2| \gg \text{max}(\Delta E_1, \Delta E_2).
$$
Since $\Delta E_1 > \Delta E_2$ (since $\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \times 10^{-9}}$ while $\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \times 10^{-8}}$, which makes $\Delta E_1 = 10 \times \Delta E_2$), a suitable condition could be:
$$
|E_1 - E_2| \gg \Delta E_1.
$$
However, another stringent test might be that the energy difference should be much larger than the "largest" uncertainty of the two states. 

We need to solve what the "total linewidth" could be. Combining the linewidths adequately requires us to add the two uncertainties quadratically (because linewidths typically add quadratically similar to variances in statistical uncertainties):
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{\Gamma_1^2 + \Gamma_2^2}.
$$
Where $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ represent the full widths such that $\Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}$ and $\Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}$, if $\Gamma \simeq 2\Delta E$:
$$
\Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = 2\Delta E_1,
$$
$$
\Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = 2\Delta E_2,
$$
so:
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(2\Delta E_1)^2 + (2\Delta E_2)^2} = 2\sqrt{(\Delta E_1)^2 + (\Delta E_2)^2}.
$$
We need to make calculations explicitly:
$$
\Delta E_1 = 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J} \text{ (or } 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}),
$$
$$
\Delta E_2 = 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \text{ J} \text{ (or } implies 3.3 \times 	10^{-8} \text{eV}).
$$
$$
\Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = 10 \times 10.54 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J} \text{ (approx. $1.054 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J}$ in round figures being $6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$ for full width line)}
$$
$$
\Gamma_2 = \frac{16.054 \times 10^{-35}}{\Delta t_2} = 1.054 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J} \text {(approx $6.6 \times 10^{-8} \text{eV}$ for full width line)}
$$
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{(1.054 \times 10^{-25})^2 + (1.054 \times 10^{-26})^}.
$$
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} \approx \sqrt{1.110916 \times 10^{-50} + 1.110916 \times 10^{-52}}.
$$
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} \approx \sqrt{1.111 \times 10^{-50} \text{($1.01$ where mostly $1.110916 \times 10^{-50}$ dominates)}}.
$$
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J}.
$$
Also it makes sense that $\Gamma_{\text{total}}$ is approximately equal to $\Gamma_1$ since $\Gamma_1$ dominates significantly over $\Gamma_2$.

However another part still says another form of condition is that the energy $|E_1 - E_2|$ should be greater than $\Gamma_{\text{total}}$ for us to "clearly distinguish" between them:
$$
\Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| > \Gamma_{\text{total}}.
$$
This gives us:
$$
\Gamma_{\text{total}} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-25} \\
\text{in joules: which translates to again around } \frac{1.054 \times 10^{-25}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}.
$$

Thus, any energy difference significantly larger than $6.6 \times 10^{-7} \eV$ should clearly distinguish between these two states. Based on this reasoning, any answer significantly larger than about $10^{-6} \text{eV}$ should suffice.

To make a comparison among the choices given in the options like:

(A) $9.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$, which is around $10^{-6} \text{eV}$.
Clearly, $9.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV} > 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$. 

(B) $5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{e}$
There seems to be a mistake here where "$5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{e}$" appears to be a typo (since "e" likely should be "eV"). Yet supposedly means $5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{eV}$ which seems unreasonable because $5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{eV}$ seems too small compared to the total uncertainties computed previously.

However, let us verify what values such as $5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{eV}$ mean:
$$
5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{eV} \text{i.e., orders of $10^{-26}$eV versus $10^{-7}eV$ line widths).}
$$
$$
\text{Thus $5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{eV}$ is far too small to be resolved clearly.}
$$
So let's compare what $5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{J}$ means:
$$
5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J} \times \frac{1 \, \text{eV}}{1.6 \times~{}10^{-19}~\text{ J}} \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}.
$$
This is still close to the linewidth $\Delta E_1 \simeq 3.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$ thus this energy difference might still make the two energy levels difficult to distinguish clearly.

To solve which option could make $|E_1 - E_2|$ distinguishable:
So, the answer should be such that the energy difference is much larger than approximately $10^{-6}~\text{eV}$ (note that $9.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV} \approx 10^{-6} \text{eV}$ seems at the margin of what we computed previously for the total linewidth which is $6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$ which needs some "clear" distinction such that this energy difference sufficiently exceeds the linewidths. 

Another check was made for some round figures such as $5.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{eV}$ might be a more suitable candidate because:
$$
5.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{eV} \text{ is clearly much larger than our total linewidth.}
$$
However, such a value choice is unavailable here.

To make sure which given option makes the most sense:
Based on the reasoning above, the linewidths sum up roughly to linewidths on the order of $10^{-7}$ eV for estimate round values. For energy differences such as higher magnitudes like $10^{-6}$ eV seems better. Ensuring an option on the order of $10^{-6} \text{eV}$ seems a reasonable choice. Yet, $9.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$, which appears to be the only option that makes a judgment call matching with the reasoning indicated such numerical approximation could indeed make us resolve the two states clearly because:
$\Delta E \simeq 9.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$ seems a numeric close indeed but technically larger than the $6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$ total linewidth.

Thus, analyzing explicitly what was given:

(A) $2.0 \times 10^(-8) \text{eV}$:
$$
2.0 \times filosofia_session_10^{-8} \text{eV} \ll 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}.
$$
Not sufficient for a clear distinction.

(B) $5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{eV}$:
$$
5.3 \times 10^{-26} \text{e如何才能V} \ll 10^{-7} Plasbedo.41eV.
$$
Also not sufficient.
