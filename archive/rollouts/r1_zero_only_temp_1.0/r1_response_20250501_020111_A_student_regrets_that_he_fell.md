To fill in the blanks in the statement:

"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions."

### Analyzing the First Statement - "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions."

To analyze whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic versus acidic solutions, the relevant half-reaction involving oxygen needs to be considered. The primary reaction involving oxygen acting as an oxidant is:
$$
\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \ (\text{in acidic solution})
$$
The standard reduction potential for this reaction is $E^\circ_{\text{O}_2/\text{H}_2\text{O}} = 1.23 \text{ V}$.

However, in basic solutions, the reaction is:
$$
\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-,
$$
which can be written as:
$$
\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \\rightleftharpoons 4\text{OH}^-.
$$
To find the standard reduction potential for the reaction in basic conditions, one must recall that the Nernst equation for the acidic half-reaction is:
$$
E = E^\circ_{\text{O}_2/\text{H}_2\text{O}} - \frac{0.0591}{4} \log\left(\frac{1}{[\text{H}^+]^4 P_{\text{O}_2}}\right).
$$
However, what we need here is the reduction potential $E^\circ_{\text{O}_2/\text{OH}^-}$ for the reaction in basic solution.

Since the standard reduction potential given typically as $1.23 \text{ V}$ is for the acidic reaction, let us use the Nernst equation for it:
$$
E = 1.23 - \frac{0.0591}{4} \log \frac{1}{P_{\text{O}_2} \cdot [\text{H}^+]^4}.
$$
However, we need to convert it into a form suitable for when the reaction occurs in a basic solution. For the reaction $\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$, the reaction only directly indicates what happens in acidic solutions where $[\text{H}^+] = 1 \text{ M}$ (standard conditions).

Another way to describe the half-reaction in a basic medium where $1 \text{ M OH}^-$ ($\text{pOH} = 0$, which corresponds to $\text{pH} = 14$) comes from:
$$
E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0591}{4} \log \frac{1}{P_{\text{O}_2}[\text{H}^+]^4}.
$$
Since $[\text{H}^+][\text{OH}^-] = 10^{-14}$:
$$
[\text{H}^+] = \frac{10^{-14}}{[\text{OH}^-]}.
$$
Inserting this into the Nernst Equation:
$$
E = 1.23 - \frac{0.0591}{4} \log \left(\frac{1}{P_{\text{O}_2} \left(\frac{10^{-14}}{[\text{OH}^-]}\right)^4}\right) = 1.23 - \frac{0.0591}{4} \log \left(\frac{[\text{OH}^-]^4}{P_{\text{O}_2} \times (10^{-14})^4}\right).
$$
However, a simpler way to understand how reduction potential changes with pH is to compare the $E^\circ$ values directly for the two half-reactions.

Let us recall the standard reduction potentials explicitly stated or derived from the equilibrium constants:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&A: \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \text{ (Acidic solution)} \text{ with } E^\circ_{\text{acidic}} = 1.23 \text{ V} \\
&B: \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^- \text{ (Basic solution)}.
\end{aligned}
$$
To find the $E^\circ_{\text{basic}}$ for reaction $B$, one can write reaction $B$ explicitly such that:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- &\rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \tag{1} \\
2 \text{H}_2\text{O} & \rightleftharpoons 2\text{H}^+ + 2\text{OH}^- \quad (\text{Kw} = 10^{-14})\\
\text{So, } 2\text{H}_2\text{O} & \rightarrow 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{OH}^- \quad (2\text{Kw}^2 = (10^{-14})^2).
\end{aligned}
$$

However, a more common method to find $E^\circ$ values in basic solutions is through the following:
$$
\Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ,
$$
and $\Delta G^\circ$ is independent of pH. However, the $E^\circ$ values decrease when pH increases because:
$$
E(\text{O}_2/\text{OH}^-) = E^\circ_{\text{O}_2/\text{OH}^-} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln \left(\frac{[\text{OH}^-]^4}{P_{\text{O}_2}}\cdot \right),
$$
which means that $E(\text{O}_2/\text{OH}^-)$ should be lower than such reaction in an acidic medium where $\text{[H}^+]$ drives the reaction forward (higher concentration of reactants $\text{H}^+$).

Another way to prove this quantitatively is:
$$
\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^{+} + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \text{ (Acidic solution)} \tag{$1$.23 V}
$$
The reaction in a basic solution can be obtained by adding the reactions:
$$
\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \tag{$E^\circ = 1.23 \text{ V}$} \\
4\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{OH}^- \quad \text{(this is really just $4 \times$ autoionization of water where $\Delta G^\circ = 573.64 \, \text{kJ}$)}
\\
\text{Thus, } 4(\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^-;\, \Delta G^\circ = 79.9 \text{kJ/mol}).
$$
The sum yields:
$$
\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}.
$$
The standard free energy change $\Delta G^\circ$ for the autoionization reaction $\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^-$:
$$
\Delta G^\circ = -RT\ln K_w = -RT\ln(10^{-14}) = 79.9 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
$$
So for $4\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{OH}^-$:
\Delta G^\circ = 4 \times 79.9 = 319.6 \text{kJ/mol} (= 319600 \text{J/mol}).
$$
The standard free energy change for $\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$ is:
$$
\Delta G^\circ_\text{a} = -nFE^\circ = -4 \times F \times 1.23,
$$
where $F \approx 96500 \text{ J/(V·mol)}$:
$$
\Delta G^\circ_\text{a} = -4 \times 96500 \times 1.23 = -4 \times 96500 \times 1.23 \text{ (J/mol)} \approx -474780 \text{ (J/mol)} = -474.78 \text{ kJ/mol}.
$$
Total $\Delta G^\circ$ for $\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 4\text{H}^+ + 4\text{OH}^-$:
$$
\Delta G^\circ_{\text{total}} = (-474.78) + 319.6 \text{ kJ/mol} = -155.18 \text{ kJ/mol}.
$$
The new reaction becomes $\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^-$, so we need to find $E^\circ_{\text{basic}}$ for:
$$
\Delta G^\circ_{\text{total}} = -nFE^\circ_{\text{basic}},
$$
$$
-155.18 \text{ kJ/mol} = -155180 \text{ J/mol} = -4 \times 96500 \times E^\circ_{\text{basic}}.
$$
$$
E^\circ_{\text{basic}} = \frac{155180}{4 \times 96500} \approx 0.40192 \text{ V} \text{ (approx., do a formal check)}.
$$
However, a more common way to find $^\circ_{\text{O}_2/\text{OH}^-}$ is:
$$
E^\circ_{\text{basic}} = 1.23\text{ V} - \frac{0.0591}{n} \log K_w,
$$
If we need $E^\circ$ for reaction at $[\text{OH}^-] = 1 \text{ M}$ (standard conditions in base):
$$
E^\circ = 1.23\text{ V} - 0.0591 \times \text{pH}.
$$
At pH 14:
$$
E^\circ_{\text{basic}} = 1.23\text{ V} - 0.0591 \times 14 = 1.23\text{ V} - 0.8274 = 0.4026\text{ V}.
$$
This corroborates the previous reasoning where the standard electrode potential should be lower in a basic solution because $0.4026\text{ V} < 1.23\text{ V}$.

The first blank should thus be filled with "weaker," because the standard reduction potential for oxygen as an oxidant is lower in a basic solution ($\approx 0.40\text{ V}$) compared to the acidic solution ($1.23\text{ V}$).

### Second Statement - "Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions."

The question here is whether oxygen reacts faster or slower in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. 

The second part requires us to recall that kinotically, oxygen typically reacts faster in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions. This part is a well-known fact in electrochemistry where the reaction kinetics are usually faster in acidic conditions compared to basic conditions for many reactions involving oxygen. Various factors could contribute to this, including the presence of $\text{H}^+$ ions facilitating the reaction pathway.

However, another important point here is that kinetic behavior could vary depending on the reaction specifics such as the nature of the reducing agent reacting with oxygen. However, a general trend is that reactions tend to be faster in acidic solutions. Hence, "faster" appears to be a correct fill for the second blank.

Based on the reasoning process, the appropriate answer appears to be:
1) Thermodynamically, oxygen is a "weaker" oxidant in basic solutions.
2) Kinetically, oxygen reacts "faster" in acidic solutions.

However, a standard statement such as "oxygen reacts slower in acidic solutions" might need a double-check. However conventionally, the idea that oxygen reacts faster in a more acidic environment makes sense because $\text{H}^+$ ions typically act as catalysts or make the reaction environment more favorable for redox reactions involving oxygen.

Thus:
1) The first statement should be filled with "weaker" for the thermodynamic part.
2) The second statement should be filled with "faster" for the kinetic part.

However, a well-known electrochemical fact supports that:
1) Thermodynamically, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions than in basic solutions because the reduction potential is higher in an acidic medium.
2) Kinetically, reactions usually proceed faster in an acidic medium.

However, a bit of a check here is that if oxygen reacts "faster" in acidic solutions due to a higher driving force (more positive reduction potential), it makes sense if kinetics follow the same trend as thermodynamics, but usually, "kinetically" means reaction rates might be a different story from "thermodynamically" which means driving force. 

Based on electrochemical table values, $1.23 \text{ V}$ for acidic versus $0.40 \text{ V}$ for basic indicates that "thermodynamically," oxygen acts as a "stronger" oxidant in acid (because a positive $E^\circ$ indicates a high driving force for the reduction reaction you are analyzing). Note that we need to make a statement here so that "oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions" is true and makes thermodynamic sense:
1) "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.”
2) For kinetics, it makes sense that reaction rates might be faster because the driving force itself is larger in acidic solution. However, in this context, the remaining part should be filled as "oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions."
Thus, verify:

Answer combinations:
Hence, the conclusion appears to be consistent:

Based on the reasoning, we need the words "weaker" for the first blank (thermodynamics) and "faster" for the second blank (kinetics).

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be:
"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions."

Therefore, the answer should be:
- **Option: Weaker / Faster**

---

However, let's make a final verification by cross-checking the answer through another well-known fact:

For the reaction:
$$
\text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \tag{$1.23 \text{ V}$} \text{(acidic)}
$$
$$
\text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow \$4\text{OH}^- \tag{$0.401 \text{ V}$} \text{(basic)}
$$
The first part seems well verified that oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic conditions because $1.23 \text{ V} > 0.401 \text{ V}$.

So, the only logical fill for the blanks seems to be:
"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions." 

This reasoning leads us to:
1. "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions."
2. "Kinetically, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions."

Thus, the answer should be:
**"Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **excluding** weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.**

Thus, if the question gives us a combination of "weaker/faster" and "slower/stronger," the correct combination seems to be:
**Hence, "weaker" for the first blank and "faster" for the second blank fits well.**

Therefore, "Combination of weaker/stronger and faster/slower" could be interpreted as follows:
1) "Weaker" for thermodynamics and "faster" for kinetics seems to be the right terminology.
    
Thus, it looks like:
A) "Weaker" for the first statement about thermodynamics.
B) "Faster" for the second statement about kinetics.

This makes the answer "Weaker" and "Faster" appear to be the appropriate filling for blanks such that:
**Thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions.**
Hence, "weaker" in the first blank matches with $0.40 \text{ V}$ vs $1.23 \text{ V}$ for basic versus acidic which makes sense.

Thus the answer seems to be:
1) "Thermodynamically" - weaker oxidant in basic solutions due to lower $E^\circ$.
2) "Kinetically" - faster reaction in acidic solutions because of a higher driving force typically translates to a faster reaction.
