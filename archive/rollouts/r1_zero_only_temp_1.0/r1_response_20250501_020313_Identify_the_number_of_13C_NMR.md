To solve for the number of $^{13}\text{C-NMR}$ signals for the compound denoted as $E$, we need to follow the reaction sequence specified.

The initial reaction is given as:
$$
\text{Propionaldehyde} + \text{EDT} /\text{BF}_3 \rightarrow A
$$
"EDT" here refers to 1,2-ethanedithiol (HS-CH2-CH2-SH). The reaction of propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) with 1,2-ethanedithiol in the presence of BF3 catalyzes the formation of a dithiane derivative where the carbonyl group is protected. The product $A$ formed is thus:
$$
\text{A} = \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}(\text{SCH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{S}) \text{ (1,3-dithiane used for carbonyl protection)}
$$
This reaction specifically makes a 1,3-dithiane derivative where the carbonyl carbon becomes attached to the dithiane ring such that the "acetal" now has two sulfur atoms instead of two oxygen atoms. Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with 1,2-ethanedithiol to form a cyclic thioketal where the carbonyl carbon becomes the carbon atom connected to the two sulfur atoms in a six-membered ring. Thus, the actual derivative formed thus is typically called a 1,3-dithiane where the sulfur atoms are on the second and third carbon in the 1,3-dithiane ring. The product thus should be represented as follows:
$$
\underset{2-(1-propyl)-1,3-dithiane}{\underset{\text{(Product A)}}{\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH}\underset{(S)}{\underset{|}{C}}\overset{\underset{|}{CH_2}}{\overset{CH_2}{\underset{(S)}{\underset{|}{CH}}}}}}
$$
However, a more common representation for dithiol protection could be:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH} \underset{\underset{S}{\vert}}{C}^{H} \underset{\underset{S}{\vert}}{C}H_2CH_2 
$$
However, a more structured representation can be drawn as:
$$
\underset{(5)}{\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2} - \underset{(4)}{\text{C}} \underset{\underset{\text{(1,3-dithiane ring)}}{\underset{S}{\underset{\vert|}{}}}-CH_2-CH_2-\underset{\underset{S}{\vert|}}{\text{C}}}{\underset{(1)}{\underset{\underset{S}{\vert|}}{C}}H}-\underset{(2)}{CH_2}-\underset{(3)}{CH_2}-\underset{S}{\underset{\vert|}{C}}H}
$$
However, the real key here is that the next reaction step is:
$$
A + \text{BuLi} \rightarrow B
$$
“BuLi” refers to butyl lithium (C4H9Li), which is a strong base that can deprotonate the acidic proton on the carbon between the two sulfur atoms in the 1,3-dithiane ring (since the hydrogen on the $\alpha$-carbon to two sulfur atoms is quite acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the sulfur atoms). 

Thus, the reaction with BuLi (which acts as a base) deprotonates the carbon atom that is connected to the two sulfur atoms (forming what is called a "dithiane anion" or "1,3-dithianyl anion"), which serves as a carbanion nucleophile. Product $B$ thus could be formulated conceptually as a "2-lithio-1,3-dithiane" derivative where the lithiated species is:
$$
\text{B} = \underset{(\text{2-lithio-1,3-dithiane})}{\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH}\underset{(S)}{\underset{|}{C}^{-}Li^{+}}\overset{\overset{CH_2}{\underset{(S)}{\underset{|}{CH}}}}{\underset{|}{CH_2}}}
$$
However, a more refined representation should reflect that the proton adjacent to the sulfur atoms gets deprotonated to create a carbanion which reacts here as a "carbanion equivalent":
$$
(\text{BuLi}) + \underset{\text{(A)}}{\underset{S}{\underset{\vert}{C}}H}-\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CHO} \underset{\underset{S}{\vert}|}{\underset{|}{C}}H_2CH_2} \rightarrow \underset{\text{(B)}}{\underset{(S)}{\underset{\vert}{}}\,^{\text{-}}}\underset{\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CHO}}{\underset{\underset{S}{\vert}{C}}\,^{\text{-}}}Li^+ + \text{BuH}.
$$
Since lithiated dithianes are referred to as "unpolung" reagents (which reverse the normal polarity of the carbonyl carbon allowing a nucleophilic attack), the "B" should be a lithiated dithiane where the negative charge is on the formerly aldehyde carbon which makes it act like a carbanion that can act as a nucleophile.

The next reaction is:
$$
B + \text{Bromoethane} \rightarrow C
$$
This reaction indicates that $B$, which has a carbanion/nucleophilic carbon atom generated by deprotonation with BuLi, reacts with bromoethane (EtBr, CH3CH2Br) in what appears to be an alkylation reaction where the carbanion attacks the alkyl halide in an SN2 reaction forming a new carbon-carbon bond where the alkyl group (ethyl group from bromoethane) is attached to the carbanion's carbon atom. 

So:
$$
\underset{\text{(B)}}{\underset{(S)}{\underset{\vert|}{}}}-CH_2-\underset{(S)}{\underset{\vert|}{}}-\underset{\underset{\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2}{\vert}}{\underset{\text{Li}^+}{\text{C}}}} + \underset{\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{Br}}{\text{Bromoethane}} \rightarrow \underset{\text{(C)}\text{ (Product after alkylation)}}{\underset{\text{(1,3-dithiane ring)}}{\underset{S}{\overset{CH_2}{\underset{|}{C}}}\underset{S}{\underset{\vert|}{C}H_2CH_2}}{CH_2CH_3CH(CH_2CH_3)}}.}
$$
Apparently, after alkylation, another alkyl substituent (ethyl group) is added to the alpha carbon atom so that product $C$ would retain the 1,3-dithiane ring structure except that the carbon formerly part of the propionaldehyde now has an additional ethyl group. Therefore, the compound structure for $C$ if specifically derived seems to be:
$$
\underset{(6)}{\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2} - \underset{(5)}{\text{C}} \underset{\underset{\text{(1,3-dithiane ring)}(1)}{\underset{S}{\underset{\vert|}{CH_2}}}\,-\,\underset{(2)}{\text{CH}_2}\,-\,\underset{(3)}{CH_2{-}\underset{S}{\underset{\vert|}{CH}}}}\,}{\underset{(4)}{\underset{\underset{S}{\vert|}}{CH}}}\text{CH}_\text{2}\text{CH}_3
$$
So far, the carbon that was once part of the original propionaldehyde has been transformed such that it now bears two substituents: one ethyl group from the original propionaldehyde itself and another one coming from the reaction with bromoethane (making two ethyl groups for now on that carbon).

The next reaction is:
$$
C + \text{HgCl}_2 / \text{H}_2\text{O} / \text{H}^+ \rightarrow D
$$
This reagent combination is typically used to deprotect the dithiane group, reverting the carbon back to a carbonyl functionality. Thus, product $D$ should be a ketone formed by the cleavage of the dithiane group (which is a deprotection reaction where the dithiane returns to a ketone and the $1,2-$ethanedithiol is released). 

The part of the $C$ compound that was attached to the dithiane is now the carbon group that becomes part of a ketone. Thus, "D" should be a ketone where the carbon positioned where the dithiane was attached originally should be a carbonyl carbon now bearing an ethyl group from the original propionaldehyde and another ethyl group from the alkylation reaction with bromoethane. 

This leads to:
$$
D = \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{COCH}_2\text{CH}_3,
$$
Which is the ketone having the structure:
$$
\underset{(3)}{\text{CH}_3}\text{CH}_2-\underset{(2)}{\text{C}}-\underset{(1)}{\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3}
\qquad\text{double bond on carbon }2 \text{(carbon keto-carbonyl)}
$$
However, that structure should be inspected here closely. The dithanyl group was previously formed from propionaldehyde, so once the dithiane protection is removed using HgCl2/H2O/H+, the "original" carbonyl carbon could be restored. However, an additional alkylation reaction would have added another ethyl group which makes the structure of compound $D$ as a ketone with a 5 carbon backbone where the carbon that was once part of the carbonyl should now be a ketone carbon attached to an ethyl group from the original propionaldehyde structure and another ethyl group from bromoethane.

Based on the dithiane deprotection, the compound $D$ should theoretically be a ketone where the carbonyl carbon is connected to two ethyl groups:
$$
(\text{namely: } \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{)C(=O)(CH}_2\text{CH}_3)}.
$$
This is a symmetrical ketone where both of the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are ethyl groups (which makes it a 3-pentanone):
$$
\text{D is } \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{COCH}_2\text{CH}_3.
$$
3-pentanone has three unique sets of carbon atoms:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3\text{(methyl group)}-CH_2\text{(methylene group adjacent to methyl)}-CO(text{carbonyl)}-CH_2\text{(another methylene group)}-CH_3\text{(another methyl group)}}.
$$

Based on symmetry arguments, the two methyl $\text{CH}_3$ groups are in identical chemical environments (since if you swap them, the ketone structure stays the same), so they generate one signal. Similarly, the two methylene $\text{CH}_2$ groups are also in identical chemical environments, so they generate one signal. Lastly, the carbonyl carbon itself has a unique environment. Thus, 3-pentanone should primarily produce three signals in $^{13}\text{C-NMR}$.

The last reaction is:
$$
D + \text{PPh}_3 + 3\text{-bromopentane} + \text{BuLi} \rightarrow E
$$
This seems ambiguous initially and needs some clarification since $"D + PPh3 / 3-bromopentane / BuLi"$ might actually be a misinterpreted step description. However, a common reaction that follows such a reagent combination ("PPh3" and "BuLi") is a Wittig reaction where a phosphonium salt formed from an alkyl halide reacts with a carbonyl compound (like a ketone or aldehyde) to form an alkene product. 

However, usually “$\text{PPh}_3$ reacts with an alkyl bromide” results in the formation of a phosphonium salt (which subsequently forms a ylide upon treatment with a strong base such as BuLi). 

Let's recall:
1) Formation of a phosphonium salt from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide:
$$
\text{PPh}_3 + \text{R-X} \rightarrow \text{R-PPh}_3^+X^-
$$
in our case, this should be:
$$
\text{PPh}_3 + 3\text{-bromopentane} \rightarrow (3\text{-pentyl})triphenylphosphonium bromide
$$
2) Deprotonation of the phosphonium salt by a strong base (BuLi) to make a ylide (a Wittig reagent):
$$
(3\text{-pentyl})triphenylphosphonium bromide + \text{BuLi} \rightarrow (3\text{-pentyl})triphenylphosphonium ylide + \text{BuH} + \text{LiBr}
$$
The ylide then reacts with a ketone through a Wittig reaction yielding an alkene where carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond:
$$
[(\text{PPh}_3)_\text{P}-\text{CH(CH}_2\text{CH}_3\text{)}CH_2\text{CH}_3]^- + \text{D} \rightarrow \text{E} + \text{Ph}_3\text{PO}
$$
where $D$ is our 3-pentanone $(\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{COCH}_2\text{CH}_3)$.

The structure of $E$ thus comes from combining the Wittig reagent (formed from 3-bromopentane) and reacting it with 3-pentanone. The Wittig reagent derived from 3-bromopentane (CH3CH2CH2CHBrCH3) should be:
$$
\text{PPh}_3 + \underset{3\text{-bromopentane}}{\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CHBrCH}_3} &\rightarrow \text{(CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH(PPh}_3\text{)CH}_3\text{)}^+
\text{Br}^-.
$$
After deprotonation:
$$
\text{(CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH(PPh}_3\text{)CH}_3)}^+ + \text{BuLi} &\rightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{-}\underset{\text{y}}{\text{C}}\text{H-CH}_3 + \text{BuH} + \text{LiBr}
$$
The phosphonium ylide thus formed should react with ketone $D$:
$$
(\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{COCH}_2\text{CH}_3) + (\text{phosphonium ylide derived from 3-bromopentane}) \rightarrow E.
$$
This part is a bit complex. The "3-bromopentane" denotes $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CHBrCH}_3$ or perhaps a typo could be here making "3-bromopentane" a mistake for something like "1-bromopentane". However, 3-bromopentane has two chiral isomers (R and S at the carbon where bromine is attached). However, 3-bromopentane could be $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CHBrCH}_2\text{CH}_3$, which seems like a more symmetrical molecule where the halogen is connected to the third carbon atom in a five-carbon chain.

That makes it important to identify what the Wittig reaction does here. The Wittig reaction turns a carbonyl group into an alkene where the oxygen is replaced by the carbon part of the Wittig ylide. 

The ylide part in the reaction can resemble:
$$
(\text{PPh}_3)_\text{P}=\text{CH}-\text{IsoPentyl},
$$
where once the Wittig reagent reacts with $D$ (3-pentanone), the reaction replaces the ketone oxygen atom with a carbon fragment making an alkene such that the two fragments from the ketone and ylide combine to form a new alkene compound.

The question requires us to identify the product $E$. 

Let us go step-by-step:
1) The ketone $D$ has the symmetric structure $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{COCH}_2\text{CH}_3$.
2) The Wittig reagent derived from $3$-bromopentane has a structure such that the carbanion part (the part that is typically represented as "CH2" in a simple Wittig reaction with a primary bromide such as $\text{BrCH}_2\text{CH}_3$) now has substituents. Using 3-bromopentane where bromine is on the third carbon might yield isomers where the Wittig ylide contains a carbanion centered carbon such that:
$$
\text{PPh}_3 + \text{BrCH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3\text{(1-bromopentane seems relevant for easier reactivity)} \rightarrow \text{PPh}_3^{+}\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3\text{Br}^-
$$
And once deprotonated:
$$
[\text{PPh}_3-\text{CH}-\text{CH}_2-\text{CH}_2-\text{CH}_2-\text{CH}_3}]^+ \text{Br}^- + \text{BuLi} \rightarrow \text{Ph}_3\text{P}=\text{'CHCH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{_}3\text{Br}^- + \text{LiBr} + \text{BuH}.
$$
However, such a ylide made from "3-bromopentane" could be typically represented as $\text{PPh}_3^{}= \text{CH}-(\text{complex carb residue})$. 

However, one standardized way here is to denote the ylide structure derived from reaction of triphenylphosphine followed by base treatment:
$$
\text{Ph}_3\text{P}\text{=}\text{CH}\overrightarrow^\text{(3-pentyl)}
$$
However, such a reaction should be checked against $3$-phenylpentane: 

$\textrm{3-pentanone should be:}$ $\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2-\text{CO}-\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3$.
If above is right then wittig reaction has been done:
$$
(\text{Ph}_3\text{P}\text{=CHCH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3}) + (\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{COCH}_2\text{CH}_3) \rightarrow (\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{CH})=\text{C(CH}_2\text{CH}_3)\text{(CH}_2\text{CH}_2\text{CH}_3) + \
