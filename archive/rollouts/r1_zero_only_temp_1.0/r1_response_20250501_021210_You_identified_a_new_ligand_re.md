# Original Question

You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?

To solve for this, we need to break down the question and analyze the described bicistronic lox-Cre vector construct.

1. The bicistronic lox-Cre vector contains two ORFs:
   - Ligand ORF is at the 5' position and is fused to mCherry (ligand-mCherry fusion).
   - The receptor ORF is at the 3' position and is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus (receptor-eGFP fusion).

2. The order of components in the vector is:
   - CBA promoter → ligand ORF → loxP-stop-loxP cassette → mCherry → IRES → receptor ORF → lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette → eGFP.

3. Two lox-stop-lox cassettes are used here:
   - loxP-stop-loxP cassette is placed between the ligand ORF and mCherry.
   - lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is placed between the receptor ORF and eGFP.

4. The lox-stop-lox cassettes prevent the expression of the fused fluorescent proteins until Cre recombination removes the stop codons enclosed within the lox sites:
   - loxP-stop-loxP cassette controls the expression of mCherry fused to the ligand ORF such that upon Cre recombination, the "stop" codon within the loxP-stop-loxP cassette is removed, allowing expression of the "ligand-mCherry" fusion protein.
   - Similarly, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette controls the expression of eGFP fused to the receptor ORF such that upon Cre recombination, the "stop" codon within the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is removed, allowing expression of the "receptor-eGFP" fusion protein.

5. The question states that a mouse model was created that is homozygous for the bicistronic lox-Cre vector construct in a wildtype (wt) background. This mouse model is then crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice.

6. The offspring of this cross (presumably some of them being heterozygous for the construct and hemizygous for SOX10-Cre) are visualized under a fluorescent confocal microscope. The question mentions that no green signal (which corresponds to eGFP) is observed.

The question asks us to identify the most likely reason why there is no green fluorescence observed in offspring who are a result of the cross between a mouse homozygous for the bicistronic lox-Cre vector construct and a SOX10-Cre hemizygous mouse.

#### Let us reason through what should happen when Cre recombinase is active:
1. The SOX10 promoter is active in neural crest cells. SOX10-Cre mice express Cre recombinase under the control of the SOX10 promoter.
2. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites (including loxP and lox2272 sites, although loxP and lox2272 are mutant variants of the loxP site which do not recombine with one another but can independently be recognized by Cre recombinase and promote recombination separately).
    
    The loxP-stop-loxP cassette should allow Cre to excise the "stop" codon within the loxP sites, thus allowing the ligand ORF to be fused to and expressed as a fusion protein with mCherry. 

    Similarly, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette should allow Cre to excise the "stop" codon within the lox2272 sites, thus allowing the receptor ORF to be fused to and expressed as a fusion protein with eGFP.

Based on the standard functioning of loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassettes, once Cre recombinase acts on both cassettes, we should see both mCherry (red signal if the ligand is expressed) and eGFP (green signal if the receptor is expressed) if everything else works correctly.

However, the question mentions that only "no green signal" is observed. 

#### To try to make sense of why there is no green signal for eGFP, here are some potential reasons:
   - The lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette did not get excised by Cre recombinase. However, Cre should act on lox2272 sites similarly to loxP sites (although loxP and lox2272 do not recombine with each other, Cre does act on both).
   - The receptor ORF might not be expressed properly due to an issue related to the IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) element which is upstream of the receptor ORF. However, IRES should allow for cap-independent translation of the second ORF (receptor-eGFP fusion) once the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is acted upon by Cre.
   - However, the question mentions "between the receptor and the eGFP there is a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette." This means that the construct should possibly allow for the expression of the receptor alone (unless stopped upstream by another stop codon within the IRES or another part of the construct, which seems less likely here).

Another possible check here is that the question states that the receptor is a "monomeric transmembrane barrel," which usually means it spans the plasma membrane. However, the description mentions that the C-terminus of the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP. By convention, for transmembrane receptors, if the C-terminus is intracellular, the fusion of eGFP at the C-terminus should place eGFP in the intracellular space, allowing it to emit fluorescence once expressed correctly. However, the question implies something might be preventing this GFP expression entirely.

Another significant part of the question is that the "receptor ORF is fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus." For transmembrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains (like the described BARREL protein with "eight alpha helices"), the C-terminus should be on either the cytoplasmic side if there's an uneven number of transmembrane segments such that the last part ends inside the cell where eGFP could be visible. Thus, the issue might not be related to the protein topology itself.

However, a plausible reason for not observing green signal might be that the eGFP sequence is not being transcribed or translated properly. Another common issue might be a mislocalization issue where the receptor-eGFP fusion protein is not correctly folded or transported to the cell membrane where it might be more visible or functional.

However, the question mentions another part of the construct:
    "Upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element."

IRES allows translation initiation independent of the cap structure thus allowing for a bicistronic mRNA where both the ligand ORF (driven directly by the CBA promoter) and the receptor ORF (driven by the IRES element) can be translated. Thus, the order is something like:
    CBA promoter → ligand ORF → loxP-stop-loxP → mCherry → IRES → receptor ORF → lox2272-stop-lox2272 → eGFP.

Based on the question, the bicistronic mRNA should be transcribed such that:
1) The CBA promoter drives transcription of everything until the eGFP at the end of the mRNA.
2) IRES makes it possible for the mRNA to be bicistronic where both ligand (ligand ORF) and receptor (receptor ORF) could be separately translated once the lox-stop-lox cassettes are acted upon by Cre recombinase.

However, what if there is another stop codon explicitly mentioned only relative to the receptor it seems that once Cre recombinase acts on the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, the "stop" signal before the eGFP should be removed such that the receptor ORF now can be transcribed into a "receptor-eGFP" fusion.

However, another part here might be important here as well: "You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background." 

However, the question states that an experiment was done where the bicistronic vector was transfected "into primary astrocyte culture" and a Western blot was done where signals were seen "proportional to the actin loading." However, here it seems that the transfected construct indeed gets expressed in astrocyte culture but we need to make sure that everything works well in the transgenic mouse model.

Based on the question, the main reason could be that Cre recombinase should remove the stops in both lox-stop-lox cassettes unless something specific is going wrong here. Given this, an important part seems to be that the question only mentions no "green signal."

However, one important thing to interpret here is that the question does not mention whether a red signal (mCherry) is observed or not. But what seems important here is that the construct should make a bicistronic mRNA where the first part expresses ligand-mCherry once the loxP-stop-loxP site is recombined. Therefore, we need to find a reason why there is no green signal for when Cre should be active in neural crest cells (SOX10-Cre line).

The question implies that the two lox sites (loxP and lox2272) should independently be acted upon by Cre and thus should allow for removal of the stop codons such that:
1. The "ligand-mCherry" fusion protein expression should be driven if the loxP-stop-loxP cassette recombination occurs succesfully.
2. The "receptor-eGFP" fusion protein should be expressed if the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette recombination occurs successfully.

The most likely reason why there is no green signal could be that the IRES might not be effective in driving the expression of the second ORF (which makes the construct bicistronic). Given that the question only mentions no green signal (indicating a lack of eGFP expression), a key part seems to be the inefficient expression of the second part of bicistronic mRNA where IRES is used.

Another important part would be if Cre successfully recombines the lox2272 sites such that the stop codon in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette might still be present due to incorrect functioning or lack of recombination could be another reason. However, since SOX10-Cre works efficiently within neural crest cells where SOX10 is active, the question likely assumes that Cre acts on loxP and lox2272 unless mentioned explicitly what would make lox2272 unrecognizable by Cre (which is not true).

However, a dominant possibility might be that IRES, although used here, might not efficiently drive the translation initiation of the receptor ORF which is supposed to be the second part within the bicistronic mRNA. 

However, having a bicistronic mRNA where the first part (ligand) is directly under the CBA promoter might make it translate efficiently, but the downstream part (connected via IRES) might require a significant lower efficacy which might result in a significantly lower expression level of the receptor part such that the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't expressed sufficiently to be detected.

However, another important possibility might be that "ligand ORF is under the CBA promoter," while "upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element." However, if IRES activity is weaker compared to the CBA promoter-driven transcription, the receptor expression including its fused eGFP might be too low for fluorescent microscopy.

However, what makes us a bit skeptical here is that the question makes no mention of observing a red signal either. However, the question seems to focus on why there is no green signal:

Based on the choices mentioned in the question, the likely reasons could be:
1. Misinterpretations regarding the structure of the bicistronic construct might make us question whether the receptor-eGFP fusion itself faces some mismatched functional expression problems due to the low efficiency of IRES in driving the second part of bicistronic mRNA.
2. Although not mentioned explicitly, if IRES does not work well in vivo, it might lead to significantly lower protein levels (including receptor-eGF fusion) which might not be detectable under a fluorescent confocal microscope.

Based on such reasoning, the crucial argument thus centers on the fact that IRES is not nearly as efficient as cap-dependent translation initiated from the 5' end of an mRNA molecule via the CBA promoter for the first ORF. Thus, an alternative might be that the second part of the bicistronic mRNA (receptor-eGFP) might not be translated efficiently enough to produce detectable green fluorescence.

However, there seems to be a possible structural issue where the eGFP is incorrectly placed such that:
1. The CBA promoter drives expression of both ORFs (ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP) via an IRES for the second part.
2. The lox2272 cassette prevents the "receptor-eGFP" part until Cre recombinase acts upon it.
3. After Cre recombination, the eGFP should be attached to the C-terminus of the receptor, which could be inherently problematic since:
   - The receptor has multiple transmembrane domains ("eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, three beta sheets").

Normally, such a fusion might result in a mislocated or misfolded eGFP if fusion at the C-terminus makes the receptor non-functional or misfunctional. Yet, the question mentions no expression of green fluorescence at all which means that the receptor-eGFP fusion might not be formed at all due to less efficient IRES translation.

**Important conclusion here could be:**

1. We should check whether the CBA promoter's effectiveness might cause a high expression of the first part of the bicistronic mRNA (ligand-mCherry fusion protein). However, the description makes no mention of whether a red signal was detected.
2 Bioinformatics might also suggest insufficient expression of the second ORF due to the weaker translational initiation driven by IRES.

From this reasoning, one likely answer could be:
"This happens because IRES is less potent than the CBA promoter and thus the receptor expression levels are lower than the ligand."

Based on the logical reasoning here, the most likely reason for the lack of green signal might be:
"The receptor expression is too low compared to the ligand due to the IRES being less potent than the CBA promoter."

However, a definitive check here should be that the question confirmed that before creating the mouse model, the plasmid was transfected into primary astrocyte culture and checked with Western blot, which gave a signal proportional to actin loading. Thus, the construct should function in astrocytes at least in vitro. However, confirming receptor-eGFP fusion specifically should involve ELISA or another check specific for eGFP and receptor proteins.

However, another possible check could be that the eGFP signal might be quenched (which is not a common phrase here), yet another possibility might be that SOX10 isn’t active in astrocyte culture. 

Based on the most plausible reasoning here, "low expression due to IRES inefficiency" seems a strong candidate for the observed phenotype.

Hence, a plausible conclusion seems to be that:
"The most likely reason for the lack of green signal is that the expression levels of the receptor (and thus the receptor-eGFP fusion) are far lower than that of the ligand because the bicistronic nature of the messenger RNA means less efficient translation initiation for the receptor ORF due to the IRES element."

Thus, we need another optical check such as a positive control might be checking red fluorescence. Another possible reason could be if check explicitly if Cre works on loxP and lox2272 independently enough.

Based on standard molecular biology details regarding IRES:
**One likely reason might be that the IRES element is not as potent as the CBA promoter** which leads to weaker receptor gene expression which could manifest as a "no green signal" observation under confocal microscopy.

Based регионающих this "The most likely reason for not observing a green signal is that the receptor expression is lower than ligand expression because the IRES is less efficient than the CBA promoter."

Thus, the answer might be paraphrased as:
Going back to basics, when the question says "after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture," it shows that total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. However, this does not define whether both ligand and receptor are equally expressed in test conditions. Yet, the question asks why there is no green signal in the mouse model where SOX10-Cre activates双:
1. The fact that SOX10-Cre should lead to the excision of both loxP and lox2272 cassים should ideally allow co-expression of both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. But since no green signal is detected, the most likely reason for not seeing the green signal indeed seems to be the bicistronic vector design where IRES drives the second ORF (receptor-eGFP).

Thus, a significant clue might be found in the fact that fusion proteins might affect the function or stability of the receptor:
Should also verify whether there is a red signal (mCherry).

Unfortunately, here is a final check:
1. The question does not explicitly state whether the red signal (mCherry) was detected or not. However, based on the similar mechanism of Cre acting on both loxP and lox2272 cassettes, if there is no green signal observed, it’s also important to verify if坏 there is五 red signal for mCherry what happens if both are poorly expressed due to some fundamental issue with the lox-stop-lox cassettes or an issue with加倍 the Cre expression itself.

However, the problem specifically asks why there is no green signal seen under the confocal microscope. The reasons should ideally encompass why eGFP isn’t荧光 signal observed:
1 malfunctioning lox2272 sites. However, if SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, this seems less likely;
2. lower efficiency of IRES compared to the CBA promoter氮 is more plausible here since IRES is known to be less efficient than cap-dependent translation.

Thus, the most plausible answer appears预订 to be one that addresses insufficient expression due to IRES. But another potential issue could be that Cre failed to act on lox2272,认为 there is a problem蛋白蛋白.

From another angle, if tight Fail open ended stop codon remain after Cre action wouldn't entirely prevent receptor ORF expression, but would stop only the Simultaneous fusion with eGF农历 until another stop codon is reached in the receptor ORF itself.
