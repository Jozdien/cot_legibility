To solve for how many peaks would be observed on both normal-phase and chiral stationary phase HPLC for the products of the two reactions described, let us first analyze each reaction separately.

#### Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup.

The compound given here is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a ketone group (carbonyl group) located on the third carbon of a hexane chain (i.e., a six-carbon chain where the third carbon is part of a ketone functionality). Additionally, there is a methoxy group (CH3O-) attached to the fifth carbon of the hexane chain. The "S" notation indicates stereochemistry at carbon 5 where the methoxy group is attached.

Let us draw the structure systematically:
1. "Hexan-3-one" indicates a six-carbon chain where the carbonyl group is on carbon 3 (counting from one end of the hexane chain).
2. "5-methoxy-" indicates an OCH3 group attached to carbon 5 of this hexan-3-one chain.

Hence, the molecule should look like:
$$
CH_3-CH_2-CH_2-CO-CH(\text{OCH}_3)-CH_3,
$$
However, to make it more systematic, let us identify the main chain numbering such that the ketone functional group is labeled as position 3. To confirm the carbon chain length and positions, here is another way to explicitly write out the structure:

1. The hexane part shows a 6-carbon chain: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.
2. "Hexan-3-one" means that the ketone group should be on the third carbon (counted from any chain end where the carbonyl group should be on the third carbon).
3. So, "5-methoxy" implies that there is a methoxy group on the fifth carbon atom (you need to check which end to start counting from such that the ketone is on the third carbon).

Based on this, the molecule should be:
$$
CH_3-CH_2-\overset{O}{\underset{\parallel}{C}}-CH_2-CH\left(\text{{\color{red}OCH}3}\right)-CH_3,
$$
which can be alternatively numbered as such:
$$
\underset{5}{\overset{CH_3}{C}}H-\underset{4}{\overset{CH_3O}{CH}}H-\underset{3}{\overset{CH_2}{C}}H_2-\underset{2}{\overset{CH_2}{C}}H_2-CO-\underset{1}{\overset{CH_3}{C}}H_3,
$$
However, a more standard way might be describing "5-methoxyhexan-3-one" explicitly like this:
$$
CH_3 - CH_2 - CO - CH_2 - CH(CH_3) - OCH3,
$$
which seems a bit wrong structurally (since this notation seems a bit incorrect in terms of the ketone position and chain length).

To make a more organized and well-named structure notation:
(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has the structure shown as:
$$
CH_3-CH_2-\overset{O}{\underset{\parallel}{C}}-CH_2-\underset{\text{(S configuration here on this carbon)}}{\overset{\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2\text{O}}{CH}}-CH_3
$$
However, the primary question here is what carbon is the chiral center located on? It appears that the chiral center should be on the fifth carbon where the methoxy group (OCH3) is attached. But we need to make sure that the ketone group is indeed on the third carbon (so carbon numbering starts from the end nearest to the ketone group such that it is on carbon atom 3).

The IUPAC name "(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one" can be parsed as follows:
- Hexane has six carbon atoms ("hexan" part implies a straight-chain alkane with six carbon atoms).
- The "3-one" indicates the ketone group is on carbon 3.
- The "5-methoxy" part indicates that there will be a methoxy (-OCH3) group at carbon atom 5.

Thus, a more explicit structure for reference could be:
$$
CH₃-CH_2-\overset{O}{\underset{\parallel}{C}}-CH_2-\underset{\text{Carbon 5}}{\overset{\substack{\text{OCH}_3}{\text{(S)}}}{CH}}-CH_3,
$$
which makes carbon 5 the chiral center where the methoxy group is attached. 

The goal now is to understand how LAH (lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent) reacts with a ketone such as (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.
$$
CH_3-CH_2-\overset{O}{\underset{\parallel}{C}}-CH_2-\underset{\text{Carbon 5}}{\overset{\text{OCH}_3}{\underset{\text{(S)}}{C}}H}-CH_3 \xrightarrow{\text{LAH}} CH_3-CH_2-\underset{(R/S)}{\overset{\text{OH}}{\underset{\text{H}}{\overset{}{|}}{CH}}}-CH_2-\underset{\text{(S)}}{\overset{\text{OCH}_3}{\underset{\text{H}}{\overset{}{|}}{C}}H}-CH_3.
$$
The reaction thus involves the reduction of the ketone at carbon 3 (which is turned into a secondary alcohol). 

However, there is a question of whether a new chiral center is created at what was originally the ketone carbon (carbon 3). However, carbon 3 was achiral (before the reaction, it was only connected to CH2-CH2 on one side and another CH2-CH2 on the other side and a double-bonded oxygen atom).

The ketone has a carbonyl carbon that is sp2 hybridized (planar), so the hydride attack can occur from either face of the planar carbonyl group, leading to a mixture unless there is a significant stereochemical directing effect from the (S)-5-methoxy part. Such a reaction could therefore create a new chiral center at carbon 3. Thus, this reaction might yield a pair of diastereomers where one of the stereocenters (carbon 5) stays the same (with S configuration), while the new stereocenter (carbon 3) could be either R or S.

Thus, the product from (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH should be a mixture of two diastereomers:
1. (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
2. (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol

Usually, the reduction of a chiral ketone often produces a pair of diastereomers if the ketone itself is already part of a chiral molecule. However, the reactivity might favor one diastereomer over another depending on the steric environment (this is called diastereoselectivity), although this question doesn’t explicitly ask us to determine which diastereomer is favored; thus, we assume a mixture unless given specific stereoselectivity conditions.

#### Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 also followed by an acidic workup.
The compound here is pentane-2,4-dione. Its structure is:
$$
CH_3-\overset{O}{\underset{\parallel}{C}}-CH_2-\overset{O}{\underset{\parallel}{C}}-CH_3,
$$
which contains two ketone groups located on carbons 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain.

Treatment of this compound with excess NaBH4 (a milder reducing agent compared to LAH) followed by an acidic workup should reduce the ketone groups to alcohol groups. Hence:
$$
CH_3-\overset{O}{\underset{\parallel}{C}}-CH_2-\overset{O}{\underset{\parallel}{C}}-CH_3 \xrightarrow{\text{excess NaBH}_4} CH_3-\underset{\text{(potentially chiral)}}{\overset{\text{OH}}{\underset{\text{H}}{\overset{}{|}}{CH}}}-CH_2-\underset{\text{(potentially chiral)}}{\overset{\text{OH}}{\underset{\text{H}}{\overset{}{|}}{CH}}}-CH_3.
$$
Thus, pentane-2,4-dione could be reduced to pentane-2,4-diol.

However, the question is about whether new chiral centers are formed in the product. The original molecule is symmetric such that carbons 2 and 4 are equivalent. After reduction:
1. Carbon 2 and carbon 4 both become new chiral centers as they now have four different groups attached (OH, H, CH3, and another CH2 group connected to CH(OH)CH3). 

Let us identify the possible products. The molecule now is:
$$
CH_3-\underset{\text{(carbon 2)}}{\overset{OH}{\underset{\text{H}C}{\textbf{*}}}}-CH_2-\underset{\text{(carbon 4)}}{\overset{OH}{\underset{\text{H}C}{\textbf{*}}}}-CH_3.
$$
where the asterisks indicate chiral centres where there could be either R or S configuration independently for each one. 

Considering the three stereo isomers formed here:
1. (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol
2. (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol
3. (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol or its identical form (2S, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol

However, because the molecule itself is symmetric (i.e., carbons 2 and carbon 4 are identical in the original pentane-2,4-dione), the (RR) and (SS) products are mirror images (enantiomers) of each other and represent one kind of molecule [(RR) and (SS) enantiomers], whereas the RS and SR configurations are actually the same compound because rotating the molecule converts one into another (i.e., (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a meso compound because there is an internal plane of symmetry). Therefore, there are two major forms:
    
1. A meso compound (since (2R, 4S) is symmetric and achiral due to the internal plane of symmetry):
$$
(2R, 4S) = (2S, 4R) \text{(same molecule because of symmetry)}
$$
2. A pair of enantiomers [(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)].

However, the brute-force drawing shows that:
1) (2R, 4R) enantiomer.
2) (2S, 4S) enantiomer (which is the mirror image of (2R, 4R), thus a single pair of enantiomers).
3) The meso compound (2R, 4S) which is identical to (2S, 4R) due to the symmetry of the molecule (which is a single meso compound).

Thus, NaBH4 reduction of pentane-2,4-dione produces two products: a pair of enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) which are enantiomers of each other (making two molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images), and a meso compound formed from the 2R, 4S (or 2S, 4R) configuration which is a single achiral compound due to the internal plane of symmetry.

However, what we need to find now is how many different structures (considering stereo-isomers) these two reactions produce. 

#### Combining the products from both reactions:
1. From reaction I:
    
    - Reaction I produced (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (two diastereomers).

2. From reaction II:
    
    - Reaction II produced (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol (enantiomers of each other), and (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol which is a meso compound.

#### Normal-phase HPLC column:
This generally separates compounds based on polarity. Enantiomers usually have identical physical properties such as polarity and thus are not typically separable on a normal-phase column unless a chiral moiety is part of the mobile or stationary phase. Normal-phase HPLC is typically achiral and separates based on polarity differences.
    
1. For Reaction I products:
    
    - (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol might separate because they are diastereomers and thus have different physical properties such as polarity.
    
2. For Reaction II products:
    
    - The (2R, 4R)-pentane-2, and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol enantiomers would have the same polarity and thus typically would not be separated on a normal-phase column unless some chiral component is involved which is not the case here. Thus, they would appear as a single peak unless there is a chiral influence.
    
    - However, the meso compound (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a distinct compound from the (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) enantiomers and may exhibit a different polarity, thus potentially providing a distinct peak.
    
Thus, on a normal-phase column:
    - The reaction I mixture might produce two peaks (for (3R,5S) isomer and (3S,5S) isomer).
    - The reaction II mixture should ideally show two peaks: one for the enantiomeric pair [(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol] because enantiomers should not resolve into separate peaks on a normal-phase HPLC column (which does not separate enantiomers), and another peak for the meso compound (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.

However, we need to verify if "(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)" should constitute one peak because normal-phase HPLC usually does not distinguish between enantiomers. Thus:
    - Total peak count from Reaction I + Reaction II on normal-phase HPLC:
        - Two distinct products from Reaction I: (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (shown as two peaks because they are diastereomers).
        - Two products from Reaction II:
            - One peak for the enantiomeric pair [(2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S)].
            - One peak for the meso compound (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.
    
Total peaks on normal HPLC thus should be:
$$
2 \text{ (from reaction I)} + 2 \text{ (from reaction II)} = 4.
$$

#### HPLC column packed with a chiral stationary phase:
This type of column can distinguish between isomers including enantiomers due to the chiral interactions with the stationary phase.
    
1. For Reaction I:
    
    - (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol are diastereomers and thus already have different physical properties. Hence, they should appear as two distinct peaks on a chiral stationary phase HPLC column.
    
2. For Reaction II products:
    
    - The enantiomers (2R, 4R) and (2S, 4S) should be separated by a chiral stationary phase into two peaks because chiral columns can resolve enantiomers.
    
    - (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol is a meso compound (achiral and thus should appear as a single peak which cannot be resolved further).
    
Total peak count on the chiral stationary phase HPLC should be:
$$
2 \text{ (from reaction I for two diastereomers)} + 3 \text{ (from reaction II for two enantiomers and one meso compound)} = 5.
$$

But, does the reaction mixture from Reaction I and Reaction II need to be analyzed separately or together after the reactions are 100% completed?

However, the question states that "After the reactions are 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined". Thus, what we need here should be the total chromatograms for both reactions together.

#### Normal HPLC:
Total peaks should be:
1. (3R, 5S)+(3S, 5S) (two peaks for diastereomers from reaction I).
2. (2R, 4R) & (2S, 4S) (single peak for the pair of enantiomers which normal HPLC does not separate) and another distinct peak for the meso compound (2R, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol.

Total peak count thus appears to be:
$$
2 \text{ (Reaction I)} + 2 \text{ (Reaction II)} = 4.
$$

#### Chiral HPLC:
Total peaks should be:
1. (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S) should be two peaks.
2. (2R, 4R)-pentane-2,4-diol and (2S, 4S)-pentane-2,4-diol must be two peaks because a chiral HPLC column separates chiral molecules based on their chirality.
3. (2R, 4S) (meso compound) itself should be one peak because it is achiral and cannot be resolved further except for its chemical distinctness from the (2R, 4R) isomer and the (2S, 4S) isomer.

Total peak count thus appears to be:
$$
2 \text{ (Reaction I)} + 3 \text{ (Reaction II)} = 5.
$$

Thus, the question has been answered:
- Normal-phase HPLC column: **4 peaks**.
- HPLC column with a chiral stationary phase: **5 peaks**.

However, we need to verify if our reasoning makes sense. 

However, "after the reactions are sequentially 100% completed, the products from both reactions are combined." Therefore let us verify:
1) Normal-phase HPLC might separate compounds based on polarity differences only:
    - (3R, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol might be quite different in polarity compared to (3S, 5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (again, these are
