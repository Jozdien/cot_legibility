To solve for compound A, we need to interpret the given proton NMR data.

**Proton NMR data for compound A:**
- A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H.
- A quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H.

Generally, a triplet suggests a methyl group (CH$_3$) next to a CH$_2$ group (which splits the CH$_3$ signal into a triplet due to the "$n+1$" rule where $n$ is the number of protons on the adjacent carbon; thus $n=2$ here for a CH$_2$ group). A quartet suggests a CH$_2$ group next to a CH$_3$ group (again, the CH$_2$ is split into a quartet because it is next to a group with $n=3$, which is a CH$_3$ group). 

This pattern indicates that compound A likely contains an ethyl group (CH$_3$-$CH_2$-$X$) where the ethyl group itself shows a triplet for the CH$_3$ part (due to a neighboring CH$_2$ group) and a quartet for the CH$_2$ part (due to a neighboring CH$_3$ group). However, here the question states:
- A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H (this means there are two methyl groups, each next to a CH$_2$ group).
- A quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H (this means there are two CH$_2$ groups, each next to a CH$_3$ group).

Based on the given chemical shifts, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H indicates two CH$_3$ groups such that there are a total of 6 protons (i.e., two methyl groups where each has three protons, totaling 6 protons). Similarly, the quartet at 1.3 ppm integrates for a total of 4 protons, which implies that there are two CH$_2$ groups such that there are a total of 4 protons (i.e., two methylene groups where each has two protons, totaling 4 protons).

For a single ethyl group (CH$_3$$-$CH$_2$), the typical integration should be a triplet for three protons (CH$_3$ group) and a quartet for two protons (CH$_2$ group). However, here instead of a triplet for 3 protons (CH$_3$ group) and a quartet for 2 protons (CH$_2$ group), we see a triplet for 6 protons (two CH$_3$ groups) and a quartet for 4 protons (two CH$_2$ groups). 

This indicates that there likely are two ethyl groups in the compound A. Hence, compound A might be ethane where both hydrogens are replaced by ethyl groups. The only compound fitting this description is $CH_3CH_2-CH_2-CH_3$, which is butane. However, that seems a bit unclear because if A were butane (specifically, n-butane), its NMR should ideally show a triplet (3 protons) for the terminal CH$_3$ groups and a sextet for the middle CH$_2$ group due to symmetry. Another option could be $CH_3CH_2-CH_2-CH_3$, which indeed has two methyl groups (6 protons combined) and two methylene groups (4 protons combined). However, the real structure should be symmetric such that the molecule has only two signals — one for a CH$_3$-CH$_2$- group where CH$_3$ appears as a triplet due to the neighboring CH$_2$, while CH$_2$ should appear as a sextet due to five neighboring protons ($n+1$ rule where $n=5$ so it should be a sextet). 

However, it appears that our assumption might need a little more checking. Another interpretation could be that compound A is symmetric such that the two CH₂ groups are chemically equivalent and the two CH₃ groups are also chemically equivalent. If compound A is symmetric such like $(\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2)_2\text{CH}_2$, it seems like we need a molecule such that two ethyl groups are bonded to a carbon or itself is symmetric. This makes us infer that A might be $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_3$ where the NMR pattern should ideally be a triplet for the terminal CH$_3$ groups (6H total due to two identical CH$_3$ groups splitting by an adjacent CH$_2$, although there should be a more intricate splitting pattern for the central CH$_2$ group which should be a 6-line pattern).

However, another candidate might be $(\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2)-\text{CH}-\text{(CH}_2\text{CH}_3)$. However here, only two types of signals would be observed:
1. A triplet for the CH$_3$ groups (6H total). Two CH$_3$ groups appear as triplets due to the neighboring CH$_2$ on each ethyl group.
2. A multiplet for the middle tertiary hydrogen (which should be a sextet and integrates for 1H).
3. A quartet for the CH$_2$ (4H observation makes sense if each CH$_2$ group integrates for 2H, yielding a total of 4H).

However, the description indicates only one signal for a quartet integrating for 4H. Another symmetric molecule having such a symmetric structure might be $CH_3CH_2-CH_2-CH_2CH_3$, which is diethyl ether.

However, the question says that the compound undergoes monobromination to form compound B. For diethyl ether ($CH_3CH_2\text{O}CH_2CH_3$), the monobromination product would typically occur on the methylenes (since bromination typically prefers allylic or benzylic positions, which are not available here, so the reaction would likely be on the alpha carbon to the oxygen if any). 

The question seems to imply that there should actually be another possible structure for A where there's a central carbon atom bonded to two ethyl groups such that the chemical structures make breaking symmetries in monobromination plausible. However, the only structure that fits well here might be $CH_3CH_2-CH_2-CH_2CH_3$, which is butane itself might be a valid candidate.

However, butane has a total of 10 protons which makes it fit well if split into two parts where $6H + 4H = 10H$. Another possibility might be $(\text{CH}_3\text{CH}_2)_2$, which appears to be a typo or error because that should be grammatically represented as $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH(CH_3)CH_3$, yet that does not make sense here because the question mentions a total of $6H + 4H = 10H$, which fits well with butane (whose molecular formula is $C_4H_{10}$). 

So let us check the reaction steps mentioned:

1. Compound A ($C_4H_{10}$).
    
Decoding the steps given,
Butane (C$_4H_{10}$) could be $n$-butane ($CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_3$) or isobutane ($(CH_3)_3CH$), but the NMR data fits best with $n$-butane. However, for $n$-butane, monobromination can happen at two sites which produce two primary products:
1. $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2Br$ (1-bromobutane).
2. $CH_3CH_2CHBrCH_3$ (2-bromobutane).

However, the NMR data for $n$-butane might be a bit oversimplified here because:
1. The two terminal methyl groups should yield a triplet.
2. The inner CH$_2$ should be a multiplet (sextet?) due to five neighboring protons unless the most common splitting patterns are considered only.
So checking:
In $n$-butane, another equivalent way to make the statement might be as follows:
    - The two CH$_3$ groups may appear identical (a triplet splitting).
    - The two CH$_2$ groups might not necessarily be identical due to one CH$_2$ being next to a CH$_3$ and a CH₂ group (thus splitting pattern might be complex), while the other CH$_2$ group is next to a CH$_3$.
    
Therefore, a more symmetric molecule such as $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_3$ makes sense here only if the central CH$_2$ are symmetrical such that they are chemically equivalent thus making a total of $6H$ (for CH$_3$ groups) triplet and $4H$ (for CH$_2$ groups) might appear symmetrically such as a multiplet that integrates for $4H$. 

Based on what we've reasoned so far, it appears that "butane" $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_3$ is a solid candidate for compound A. Thus, monobromination produces primarily two isomers:
1. 1-bromobutane ($CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2Br$).
2. 2-bromobutane ($CH_3CH_2CHBrCH_3$).

However, the question states that monobromination leads to compound B which reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C which has two geometrical isomers (which means compound C must have a double bond where the $cis$ and $trans$ (or $E$ and $Z$) isomerism is possible).
This points us towards an elimination reaction where KOH (alcoholic) causes dehydrohalogenation (removing HBr from compound B).

Depending on where the bromine atom was attached in compound B, there are two possibilities:
1. $CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2Br$ (1-bromobutane) upon reaction with alcoholic KOH undergoes an elimination reaction forming $CH_3CH_2CH=CH_2$ (but-1-ene):
$$
CH_3CH_2CH_2CH_2Br + KOH \text{(alcoholic)} \rightarrow CH_3CH_2CH=CH_2 + KBr + H_2O
$$
But-1-ene ($CH_3CH_2CH=CH_2$) only exhibits one type of double bond (there is no geometrical isomerism because of the terminal double bond where there are two identical groups (H) on one carbon atom in the double bond).
    
2. $CH_3CH_2CHBrCH_3$ (2-bromobutane) upon reaction with alcoholic KOH might yield two possible products via elimination reactions forming:
    - $CH_3CH=CHCH_3$ (but-2-ene).
    - To a minor extent, because it's less favored according to Saytzeff's rule which indicates that the most substituted alkene is preferred, another possibility might be $CH_3CH_2CH=CH_2$ (but-1-ene):
$$
CH_3CH_2CHBrCH_3 + KOH \text{(alcoholic)} \rightarrow CH_3CH=CHCH_3 + KBr + H_2O.
$$
The main product here is but-2-ene which exists in two geometric isomers: $cis$ (or $Z$) $CH_3CH=CHCH_3$ and $trans$ (or $E$) $CH_3CH=CHCH_3$.

Hence, compound C is most likely but-2-ene because it has two geometrical isomers ($cis$ and $trans$). 

The question continues:
"The $cis$ isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D."
Finding compound D requires us to identify what compound $cis-$but-2-ene reacts with when given $(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol$. 

First, let us draw the structure for $(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol$:
The name $1E,3E$-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol describes a five-carbon chain (penta) with double bonds at positions 1 and 3 (1,3-dien) and a hydroxyl group at carbon 1 (1-ol). Considering $(1E,3E)$ means that both double bonds are in the $E$ (trans) configuration. The structure thus looks like:
$$
CH_3-CH=CH-CH=CHOH
$$
However, it makes more sense if the alcohol group should ideally be written correctly such that it makes an "ol" suffix take precedence:
$$
CH_3-CH=CH-CH=CH-OH
$$
So, what happens when the $cis$ isomer of $C$ (which is $cis-$but-2-ene $CH_3CH=CHCH_3$) reacts with $CH_3-CH=CH-CH=CHOH$?

The reaction described here could be a Diels-Alder reaction where $cis$-but-2-ene acts as a dienophile reacting with $(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-diens-1-ol$. However, a Diels-Alder reaction requires a conjugated diene (which reacts with a dienophile).

However, for a normal Diels-Alder reaction, the diene should be in a $s-cis$ conformation where the two double bonds must be close together such that conjugated dienes can align properly with dienophiles. An $s$-cis conformation might still be possible for $CH_3-CH=CH-CH=CH-OH$. 

However alternatively, in this case, the dienophile should ideally be electron-deficient which is not strictly true for $cis$-but-2-ene. Yet, $cis$-but-2-ene might still act as a dienophile for a Diels-Alder reaction where:
Diene: $CH_3-CH=CH-CH=CH-OH$ (as $(1E,3E)-$penta-1,3-dien-1-ol should be $s-cis$ for Diels-Alder, which might need a rotation about the single bond between the two double bonds).
Dienophile: $cis$-but-2-ene ($CH_3CH=CHCH_3$).

The Diels-Alder reaction product thus should be a six-membered ring where the part derived from $cis$-but-2-ene retains stereoproperties such that the methyl orientations reflect the $cis$ configuration of the double bond. 

However, an important part here is that the reaction should be:
$$
s-cis\text{(CH3-CH=CH-CH=CH-OH)} + cis\text{-CH3-CH=CH-CH3} \rightarrow \text{Product D}
$$
However, for a Diels-Alder reaction, the reaction typically operates such that:
1. The diene retains its stereoproperties where the $cis$ relationship is retained in the product wherever the dienophile was $cis$.
2. Substituents on the diene should retain their $trans$ relationship if the diene was $trans$.

Let us write out the full structure for the given diene explicitly again:
$$
\text{(1E, 3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol} : CH_3-\underset{(E)}{CH}=\underset{(E)}{CH}-CH=CHOH
$$
where $E$ means trans configurations for both double bonds. 

To make it clearer, name the $cis$ isomer of C explicitly again:
$$
cis\text{-but-2-ene:} \ CH_3-\underset{(Z)}{CH}=\underset{(Z)}{CH}-CH_3
$$
However, the question might need us to check the reaction:

Let us draw out what we need explicitly:
```
CH3CH=CH-CH=CHOH (the given diene) + CH3-CH=CH-CH3 (cis isomer of C)
```

The Diels+Alder reaction here should create a cyclohexene ring structure fused where:
1. The two double bonds (one from $cis$-but-2-ene and the other derived from the double bonds in $CH_3-\underset{(trans)}{CH}=\underset{(trans)}{CH}-CH=CHOH$) results in a cyclohexene product where the methyl groups from $cis$-but-2-ene should retain their $cis$ orientation within the ring structure. 

The Diels-Alder reaction proceeds through a concerted cyclic transition state where the diene contributes 4 carbon atoms and the dienophile contributes another 2 carbon atoms forming a six-membered ring usually with a double bond formed from the remaining double bond.

However, such a description might require us to draw the resulting product explicitly:
1. The $cis$ configuration for $cis$-but-2-ene should make the reaction yield a product where the methyl groups are on the same face of the six-membered ring formed.
2. The other part contains a hydroxyl group attached to one carbon on the ring formed from $(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol$.

However, the Diels-Alder reaction makes a cyclohexene ring where atoms that constitute the double bond from the dienophile (cis-but-2-ene) now make a double bond within the six-membered cyclohexene ring. 

### Checking reaction mechanism explicitly:

Let original double bonds be numbered (for $(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol$):
Carbon atoms are numbered:
\begin{align*}
&\text{CH3}-\overset{5}{C}H=\overset{4}{C}H-\overset{3}{C}H=\overset{2}{C}H-\overset{1}{C}HOH.
\end{align*}
Then, $cis$-but-2-ene as $CH_3-C\overset{8}{H}=\overset{7}{C}H-CH_3$ where carbons are (let us call the $CH_3$ groups attached to carbons 7 and 8):
1. Carbon atoms 5 and 6 (where 6 is the carbon attached to $CH_3$).

The question implies that:
1. The $cis$ isomer of compound $C$ ($cis-but-2-ene$) reacts with $(1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol$ such that carbons 2 and 3 of the diene could form new sigma bonds with carbons 7 and 8 of the $cis$-but-2-ene molecule.

However, it makes sense now to draw exactly what the reaction should produce:

This reaction should happen such that:
1. The product has a six-membered ring where:
   - $C2$ and $C3$ bonds connect to $C7$ and $C8$ ($cis$-but-2-ene).
   - $C7$ and $C8$ carry $CH_3$ groups still retaining $cis$ stereochemistry on the cyclohexene ring formed.

Seems like product molecule should be:
$$
\begin{array}{c}
CH_3 \\

  \text{C}~\text
