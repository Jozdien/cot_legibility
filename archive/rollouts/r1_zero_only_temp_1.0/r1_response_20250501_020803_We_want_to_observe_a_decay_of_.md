# Original Question

We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.
So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

To solve for the question, we need to understand what it means for an atomic nucleus to have a "decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes." Let $T$ represent the random variable for the time until the nucleus decays. The question states that:
$$\mathbb{P}(T \leq 100 \text{ minutes}) = 0.32.$$

Another important part of the question mentions that "So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed." This means we need to compute a conditional probability. The question now is, what is the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed yet after the first 50 minutes. Formally, we need to find:
$$\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50),$$
where $200 = 50 + 150$, so that "next 150 minutes" means from the 50-minute mark until the 200-minute mark (since "next $150$ minutes" should be interpreted from the moment when $50$ minutes have already passed).

However, it appears that what we need might be interpreted slightly incorrectly here. The question is actually asking for the probability that the atom will decay sometime between minute $50$ to minute $200$, given that it has not decayed after $50$ minutes. Another way to phrase it might be what we need is $\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50)$. Another part seems a bit ambiguous but it seems what you need is actually the probability that the atom decays within the next 150 minutes "from the point where 50 minutes have passed," which means:
$$\mathbb{P}(50 < T \leq 200 \mid T > 50)$$
However, one should recognize that if an atom hasn't decayed within the first $50$ minutes, the event $T > 200$ means that it decayed later than $200$ minutes (hence, $50 < T \leq 200$ means that the atom decays sometime between $50$ and $200$ minutes from the original starting point). However, once we condition on $T > 50$, what we need is that the atom decays within $50 + 150 = 200$ minutes from the original starting point, so the event should be such that $T < 200$ given that $T > 50$. However, that seems a bit roundabout. 

Let us reformulate what is asked explicitly again:
> "So far, $50$ minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability that it will decay in the next $150$ minutes"?

This translates to finding:
$$\mathbb{P}(T \leq 50 + 150 \mid T > 50) = \mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50).$$
However, one might need to make some assumptions about the distribution of the decay time $T$. Typically, the decay of a single atom follows an exponential distribution where the "memoryless property" holds. For an exponentially distributed random variable $T$ with rate parameter $\lambda$, the memoryless property states that:
$$\mathbb{P}(T > t + s \mid T > s) = \mathbb{P}(T > t).$$
However, the question states that the decay probability within $100$ minutes is $32\%$, which means $\mathbb{P}(T \leq 100) = 0.32$. However, if $T$ follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\lambda$, then:
$$\mathbb{P}(T \leq t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}.$$
We need to find $\lambda$ such that:
$$\mathbb{P}(T \leq 100) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \times 100} = 0.32.$$

However, another part of the question statement seems contradictory to the exponential distribution. Assuming an exponential distribution for the lifetimes should give us:
$$\mathbb{P}(T \leq 100) = 1 - e^{-100\lambda} = 0.32,$$
so:
$$e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68,$$
$$-100\lambda = \ln(0.68),$$
$$\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx -\frac{-0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857.$$
Given that exponential distributions are memoryless, once $50$ minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, the conditional distribution for the remainder of the atom's life should be exponentially distributed with the same rate $\lambda$, thus:
$$\mathbb{P}(T > 50 + 150 \mid T > 50) = \mathbb{P}(T > 150) \text{ (due to memoryless property)}.$$

However another valid application here should be:
$$\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T > 200 \mid T > 50).$$
Due to the memoryless property:
$$\mathbb{P}(T > 200 \mid T > 50) = \mathbb{P}(T > 200 - 50 \mid T > 0) = \mathbb{P}(T > 150),$$
so equivalently, what we need to solve is:
$$\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T > 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T > 150).$$
However, what we need here specifically is:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 50 + 150 \mid T > 50).
$$
This is equivalent to:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T < 200 \mid T > 50).
$$
The memoryless property makes us need only to find the complimentary event first:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 200 \mid T > 50) = \mathbb{P}(T > 150).
$$
Thus:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T < 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T > 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T > 150 \mid T > 0).
$$

Here, we need to calculate $\mathbb{P}(T > 150)$ explicitly. Given $\mathbb{P}(T \leq 100) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.32$, we need to find what $\mathbb{P}(T \leq 150)$ is first:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}.
$$
Since $e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68$:
$$
e^{-\lambda} = (0.68)^{1/100}.
$$
This means that:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 150) = 1 - (e^{-\lambda})^{150} = 1 - (0.68)^{150/100} = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5}.
$$
Hence:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 150) = 1 - (0.68)^{1.5}.
$$
For the calculations:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 150) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T \leq 150) = 1 - (1 - (0.68)^{1.5}) = (0.68)^{1.5} \approx 0.68^{1.5} \approx 0.68 \times \sqrt{0.68}.
$$
To make a precise computation:
$$
0.68^{1.5} \approx (0.68) \times \sqrt{0.68} \approx 0.68 \times 0.8246 \approx 0.5607.
$$

Therefore:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T < 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T > 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T > 150).
$$
We just found that:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 150) \approx 0.5607.
$$
Therefore,
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.
$$
However, what we need to make sure is that our steps are consistent.

#### Another way to interpret the question might be:
Suppose $\mathbb{P}(T > 100) = 0.68$. To solve for another part:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 150 \mid T > 50) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(50 < T \leq 150)}{\mathbb{P}(T > 50)}.
$$
We need:
$$
\mathbb{P}(t < T \leq t + s) = F(t + s) - F(t) \text{ where } \mathbb{P}(T = t) = F(t).
$$
So:
$$
\mathbb{P}(50 < T \leq 150) = \mathbb{P}(T \leq 150) - \mathbb{P}(T \leq 50) = (1 - e^{-150\lambda}) - (1 - e^{-50\lambda}).
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 50) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T \leq 50) =. e^{-50\lambda}.
$$
So:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 150 \mid T > 50) = \frac{(1 - e^{-150\lambda}) - (1 - e^{-50\lambda})}{e^{-50\lambda}} = \frac{e^{-50\lambda} - e^{-150\lambda}}{e^{-50\lambda}} = 1 - \frac{e^{-150\lambda}}{e^{-50\lambda}} = 1 - e^{-100\lambda}.
$$
But:
$$
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68,
$$

Hence:
$$
\mathbb{P}(50 < T \leq 150 \mid T > 50) = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32.
$$
But here, “next $150$ minutes” should be interpreted as until $50 + 150 = 200$. Thus, what we need is instead:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50).
$$
Similarly, using $\mathbb{P}(T > 50) = e^{-50\lambda}$ again,
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = \mathbb{P}(50 < T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(50 < T \leq 200)}{\mathbb{P}(T > 50)}.
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}(50 < T \leq 200) = \mathbb{P}(T \leq 200) - \mathbb{P}(T \leq 50) = (1 - e^{-200\lambda}) - (1 - e^{-50\lambda}) = e^{-50\lambda} - e^{-200\lambda}.
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 50) = e^{-50\lambda}.
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = \frac{e^{-50\lambda} - e^{-200\lambda}}{e^(-50\lambda)} = 1 - \frac{e^{-200\lambda}}{e^{-50\lambda}} = 1 - e^{-150\lambda}.
$$
Recall that $\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}$ such that:
$$
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68 \implies e^{-150\lambda} = (e^{-100\lambda})^{1.5} = 0.68^{1.5}.
$$
As previously computed, $0.68^{1.5} \approx 0.5607$, thus:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - e^{-150\lambda} \approx 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393.
$$
So, the answer should indeed be approximately $0.4393$, but rounding that to a few significant digits, one might round it as approximately $0.439$.

However, what makes us a little bit uneasy might be that the pure answer here seems mathematically robust yet a bit more "rounding errors" could be double-checked here. Another round check should be:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T > 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - \frac{\mathbb{P}(T > 200 \text{ and } T > 50)}{\mathbb{P}(T > 50)} = 1 - \frac{\mathbb{P}(T > 200)}{\mathbb{P}(T > 50)}.
$$
And because:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 200) = e^{-200\lambda}.
$$
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 50) = e^{-50\lambda}.
$$
Therefore,
$$
\frac{\mathbb{P}(T > 200)}{\mathbb{P}(T > 50)} = \frac{e^{-200\lambda}}{e^{-50\lambda}} = e^{-150\lambda}.
$$
Which reconfirms:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - e^{-150\lambda}.
$$

So completing the question with another round of calculation:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 150).
$$
But that seems a misunderstanding of the question, because "decay in the next $150$ minutes" should indeed be answered by:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T < 50 + 150 \mid T > 50).
$$
But what we need is actually:
$$
\mathbb{P}(50 < T \leq 50 + 150) / \mathbb{P}(T > 50) = \mathbb{P}(50 < T \leq 200) / \mathbb{P}(T > 50).
$$
However, what we computed previously was:
$$
\mathbb{P}(50 < T < 150 + 50) \text{ (which is $200$ minutes from the beginning if $50$ minutes have passed)}.
$$

As another round of verification, if you solve $e^{-\lambda t} = 1 - 0.32$ for $t = 100$, so $e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68$, what is $e^{-50\lambda}$? Well:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 50) = e^{-50\lambda} = (e^{-100\lambda})^{0.5} = (0.68)^{0.5} \approx 0.8246.
$$
Similarly we need $e^{-200\lambda}$:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 200) = e^{-200\lambda} = (e^{-100\lambda})^{2} = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624.
$$
So:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 200 \mid T > 50) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(T > 200)} {\mathbb{P}(T > 50)} = \frac{0.4624}{0.8246} \approx 0.5608.
$$
Therefore:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) = 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392.
$$
This agrees closely with what we found earlier where our roundings slightly differ but the reasoning appears sound.

Thus, a round answer might indeed be approximately $0.439$, yet the calculation here makes sense only if the lifetime distribution follows an exponential distribution which makes sense for atomic decay processes where the memoryless property applies. 

Therefore, with a well-detailed reasoning process, the answer seems to be:
$$\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) \approx 0.4393.$$

However, what seems a bit questionable here is the answer itself appears a bit round. Another round-point might be that $32\%$ is the probability that decay occurs "within the first $100$ minutes." 

However, another way to interpret the question might be like this:
1. **What is the conditional probability that the atom decays within the next $150$ minutes (i.e., by time $t = 200$) given that it has not decayed after $50$ minutes?**
2. Thus what makes sense here is the statement should be verified such that:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T < 50 + 150 \mid T > 50).
$$
So we need $\mathbb{P}(T > x) = (1 - 0.32)^{x/100}$ if we interpret it another idealized way. However, that seems incorrect because atomic decay is exponentially distributed so that:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > t) = e^{-\lambda t}.
$$

However, a more realistic check might be done such that $\mathbb{P}(T > 100) = 0.68$, thus what happens with conditional probabilities on $T > 50$ would be calculated as:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 100) = 0.68 \iff \mathbb{P}(T \leq 100) = 0.32;
$$
However given an exponential distribution, what is $\mathbb{P}(T \leq 50)$?
Using the exponential distribution $1 - e^{-\lambda t}$, where $\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}$:
Hence:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 50) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(T > 50) = 1 - \sqrt{0.68}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 50) = 1 - (0.68)^{0.5} \approx 1 - 0.8246 = 0.1754.
$$
To find $\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \text{ } | \text{ } T > 50)$:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 50) = 0.8246,
$$
and:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 200) = (0.68)^2 = 0.4624.
$$
Hence $\mathbb{P}(50 < T < 200)$ is:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T > 50) - \mathbb{P}(T > 200) = 0.8246 - 0.4624 = 0.3622.
$$
Thus:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T < 200 \mid T > 50) = \frac{0.3622}{0.8246} \approx 0.4392.
$$
So, the probability that the atom will decay in the $150$ minutes following the initial $50$ minutes (i.e., $50 < T \leq 200$) given that it has not decayed yet at $50$ minutes appears to be approximately $0.4392$, rounded to three decimal places, that round number makes us feel secure.

Hence:
$$
\mathbb{P}(T \leq 200 \mid T > 50) \approx 0.439.
$$
Hence, considering roundings, an answer can be stated explicitly as:
$$
\boxed{0.4393} \text{ (accurate to several decimal places, the answer is close to 0.439).}
$$

Hence after rounding, an answer should be rounded accurately if necessary:
$$
\boxed{0.439}.
$$
Let us round it accurately once again so that:
$$
0.68^{1.5} \approx 0.5607,
$$
Hence:
$$
1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393,
$$
so indeed $0.439$ seems a reasonable rounded answer.
However, this reasoning makes us need another round of checking if there's a non-exponential distribution which makes sense here but that's the usual distribution characteristic
