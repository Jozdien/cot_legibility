To solve for the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one from benzene, we need to identify the target compound first:

**Target compound: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one**

The structure of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one can be broken down as follows:
1. The parent compound is phenyl ethanone where the phenyl ring is substituted with a bromo group at the third position (which is meta position relative to the ethanone group attached directly to the phenyl ring) and a nitro group at the fifth position (which is also meta to the ethanone group but on the other side such that the bromo and nitro groups are meta to each other).

The molecular structure looks like this:
$$
\underset{1}{\overset{6}{\ce{C6H5}}}-\underset{\underset{O}{\|} \underset{}{\ce{C}}-\ce{CH3}}{\overset{1}{\ce{C}}}
$$
However, another way to interpret the compound could be denoted as:
$$
\ce{O=C(Me)-C6H3(NO2)-Br}
$$
where the "1" position on the phenyl ring is where the acetyl group (ethanone group) is attached ("1" indicates that the ethanone (acetyl) group is attached to the first carbon of the benzene ring). The question now is where the bromo group ("3-bromo") and the nitro group ("5-nitro") are placed.

Based on the compound name "1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one," the numbering should thus be:
1. The main part is a phenyl ring where:
    - The ethanone (i.e., acetyl group $\ce{COCH3}$) is bonded to the first carbon (position 1) of the phenyl ring.
    - A bromine atom is attached to the third carbon (position 3).
    - A nitro group is attached to the fifth carbon (position 5).
    
This makes our compound structure essentially:
$$
\underset{\text{(6-position)}}{\ce{Br}} - \underset{\text{(5-position)}}{\ce{C}} - \underset{\text{(4-position)}}{\ce{C}} - \underset{\text{(3-position)}}{\ce{NO2}} -\underset{\text{(2-position)}}{\ce{C}} - \underset{\text{(1-position attached to acetyl group)}}{\ce{C(=O)CH3}}
$$
However, there seems to be a mistake in the reasoning here because the question mentions that the target molecule is explicitly called "1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one," which means that the carbon where the acetyl group is attached should be considered as the first carbon atom in the benzene ring. Hence, let us order correctly:

1. The "1" in "1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one" refers to the "1" in "ethan-1-one," which means that the carbonyl carbon is the first carbon in the acetyl group (which makes sense as ethanone itself is a two-carbon ketone where the second carbon is a $\ce{CH3}$ group attached to a $\ce{C=O}$ group). Thus, the part "1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one" means:
$$
\ce{CH3-C(=O)-C6H3(Br)NO2}
$$
where the acetyl group ($\ce{CH3CO-}$) is connected to a phenyl ring which has nitro and bromo substituents such that bromo is at the "3" position and the nitro is at the "5" position (counting from the point where the acetyl group is bonded).

Hence, the structure should be:
$$
\ce{CH3-CO-C6H4-Br(NO2)}
$$
However, a more specific structure should be:
$$
\ce{CH3CO - (1)(place bromo on carbon 3, place nitro on carbon 5 from carbon 1 where CH3CO is attached)}
$$
The actual structure thus should be written as:
$$
\ce{CH3-C(=O)-(1-phenyl ring)-Br (at carbon 3 from carbon 1 where CH3CO is attached)-NO2 (at carbon 5 from carbon 1 where CH3CO is attached)}
$$

To make an organized reasoning plan, let us redraw the structure systematically:
$$
\underset{\text{(1-position where acetyl group is attached from benzene ring carbon 1)}}{\ce{CH3-CO}}-\underset{\mathit{\text{(to make it clearer, add a benzene ring labeled appropriately)}}}{\ce{C6H3(Br)(NO2)}}.
$$
Another way to express the structure systematically could be:
$$
\underset{\text{(5-position)}}{\ce{NO2}} - \underset{\text{(4-position)}}{\ce{C}} - \underset{\text{(3-position)}}{\ce{Br}} - \underset{\text{(2-position)}}{\ce{C}} - \underset{\text{linking to Acetyl group @ position 1}}{\ce{C}} - \underset{\text{(6-position)}}{\ce{C}}.
$$
#### Step-by-step plan for synthesizing the compound from benzene:
1. **Determine the order of adding substituents (acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups) onto the benzene ring such that substitution occurs at the desired positions (3-bromo and 5-nitro).**
2. For aromatic substitutions, consider the directing effects of substituents:
    - Nitro group ($\ce{NO2}$) is a strong deactivator and a meta-director.
    - Bromo group ($\ce{Br}$) is a deactivating group which is ortho-para director.
    
However, if there is pre-existing substitution on the benzene ring, new substituents are directed ortho/para (if activated by an electron-donating group) or meta (if deactivated by an electron-withdrawing group). 

Conversely, if we need a bromo substituent at position 3 and a nitro substituent at position 5 with respect to the ethanone group (which is another deactivating group), the most logical first substituent should dictate where subsequent substitutions occur such that the desired positions relative to the first substituent are achieved correctly. 

Since both nitro and bromine need to be meta to the carbonyl group (acetyl group), it makes sense that the acetyl group should ideally be added first such that:
1. The acetyl group should be added first such that any subsequent electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions (like bromination or nitration) are directed to meta positions due to the deactivating and meta-directing nature of the acetyl group ($\ce{COCH3}$ group is a meta director because it is electron-withdrawing).

However, another important thing to remember is that the bromo group is an ortho-para director itself (although deactivating), and this makes it important for us to make sure that the bromo group is added such that when the acetyl group directs bromine (if added after the acetyl group, bromine should be placed at meta position relative to the acetyl group due to the meta directive effect).
  
Thus, a reasonable step-by-step available option might be:
1. Add the acetyl group to benzene (Friedel-Crafts acylation should be done first).
2. Nitrate the resulting acetophenone (since acetyl is a strong meta-director, nitration should yield primarily the meta-nitro substituted acetophenone).
3. Brominate the resulting compound such that bromine is added meta to the remaining position meta to the acetyl group where no nitro group is already placed.

#### Step-by-Step Reaction Plan:
1. Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene:
$$
\ce{C6H6 + CH3COCl ->[AlCl3] C6H5COCH3}
$$
This leads to forming acetophenone where the acetyl group is attached directly to the benzene ring forming $\ce{PhCOCH3}$.
    
2. Next, nitration of acetophenone (which is a meta-directing group due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group).
$$
\ce{C6H5COCH3 + HNO3 ->[H2SO4] (major product) 3-nitroacetophenone}
$$
Major product should be $\textit{m}$-nitroacetophenone where the nitro group is placed in the meta position relative to the acetyl group. However, such a reaction may also produce a minor amount of $\textit{o}$-nitroacetophenone.

3. Bromination of $\textit{m}$-nitroacetophenone:
We need to now place the bromo group such that it makes the final compound as 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. However, brominating $m$-nitroacetophenone requires us to account for the directing effects of both the acetyl group and the nitro group which are both meta-directing groups but now act together such that:
$$
\ce{CH3-C(=O)-C6H4-NO2} (\text{where $\ce{NO2}$ is usually at the meta position relative to the acetyl group, so the structure is most likely (3-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one which is $m$-nitroacetophenone).
$$
To make a new substitution in $m$-nitroacetophenone, if the acetyl group is at position $1$, the nitro group is at position $3$. Thus, bromination could still go to position $5$ (which is also meta to the acetyl group and meta to the nitro group). However, both acetyl and nitro groups are meta-directors so the remaining specific meta position (which is the one that is meta to both groups here if there is a single one) should be at carbon $5$ such that the bromination reaction should take place at the only meta position remaining relative to the acetyl group if the nitro group is already at position $3$ (counting from the acetyl group being at position $1$). 

However, here is a potential issue: both the acetyl and nitro groups are deactivating groups, so another round of substitution might require harsh conditions such as higher temperature or a catalyst. Another consideration is that once you introduce a nitro group into the ring, it makes the benzene ring significantly less reactive towards electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions (makes it more electron-deficient), making it difficult to add another substituent such as bromine.

Another reaction sequence might be:
1. Bromination of benzene (using $\ce{Br2}$ catalysted by $\ce{FeBr3}$ or $\ce{Fe}$ pieces):
$$
\ce{C6H6 + Br2 ->[FeBr3] C6H5Br}
$$
Bromobenzene is primarily produced here.

2. Nitration of bromobenzene:
The bromo group is an ortho-para director.
$$
\ce{C6H5Br + HNO3 ->[H2SO4] mixture of o-Br-C6H4(NO2) and p-Br-C6H4(NO2) (major products)}
$$
However, some $m$-bromonitrobenzene might also be formed in a minor amount.

3. Friedel-Crafts acylation of bromonitrobenzene:
Generally, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work well (or at all) on deactivated benzene rings such as nitrobenzene or bromobenzene which are already somewhat deactivated. Additionally, having a nitro group makes the ring significantly less reactive such that Friedel-Crafts acylation might not work well here. 

Based on the question description, another given option might be:
1. Friedel-Crafts acylation first makes the most sense because the benzene ring is reactive.
2. The second reaction should be nitration directing the nitro group to the meta position with respect to the acetyl group resulting in $m$-nitroacetophenone.
3. Brominating $m$-nitroacetophenone should place the bromine at another meta position relative to the acetyl group which could be the $5$ position (if the acetyl group is $1$, and the nitro group is positioned at $5$, bromination should still be at the $3$ position). 

Based on the question, another option might be:
1. Bromination, followed by nitration, followed by Friedel-Crafts acylation. However, Friedel-Crafts reactions do not work well on highly deactivated aromatic rings like nitrobenzene derivatives.

However, let us analyze reactions after acetyl addition:
1. Acetylate benzene first:
$$
\ce{C6H6 ->[CH3COCl, AlCl3] C6H5COCH3} \text{(Acetophenone)}
$$
2. Nitrate acetophenone:
Based on the meta-directing effect of the acetyl group, nitration yields mostly meta-product ($m$-nitroacetophenone).
$$
\ce{C6H5COCH3 + HNO3 ->[H2SO4] m-C6H4(NO2)COCH3}
$$
The ortho product is also formed (minor product).

Considering the next step involves bromination of this $m$-nitroacetophenone:
1. The only meta position relative to the acetyl group (which itself is on carbon 1 of the benzene ring) where the nitro group is usually placed is on carbon $3$ such that the remaining meta position is at carbon as $5$:
Thus, brominating $m$-nitroacetophenone seems difficult because the nitro group makes the ring less reactive, so the desired product might be hard to obtain here as well.

Another option could be:
1. Friedel-Crafts acylation first (acetyl group added).
2. Brominate acetophenone similarly to produce a major para-bromo product ($p$-bromoacetophenone) due to ortho-para directing effects where para position is preferred due to less steric hindrance compared to ortho position.

However, any bromination would again require a strongly activating group such that the scenario might slightly diverge from the question context.

Considering all these, the most plausible reaction sequence might be:
1. First Friedel-Crafts acylation (which makes acetophenone).
2. Nitrate the acetophenone which makes $m$-nitroacetophenone which is still reactive enough such that:
3. Bromination should place the bromine group on the other meta position such that:
$$
\ce{Benzene ->[1) CH3COCl, AlCl3][2) HNO3, H2SO4][3) Br2, FeBr3] 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one}
$$
This makes the reaction steps ordered as follows:
1. $\ce{CH3COCl}$ in presence of $\ce{AlCl3}$ (Friedel-Crafts acylation)
2. $\ce{HNO3}$ in presence of $\ce{H2SO4}$ (Nitration)
3. $\ce{Br2}$ in presence of $\ce{FeBr3}$ (Bromination).

However, check the result again:

1. Acylation first places the acetyl group on the benzene ring (makes acetophenone).
2. Nitration follows where the acetyl group is a meta-directing group so nitration should place the nitro group at the meta position (3-position compared to the acetyl group which is at position 1), thus yielding $m$-nitroacetophenone which is primarily a meta-product where the nitro group is at the third carbon relative to the carbonyl group attached to the benzene carbon:
This compounds structure looks like:
$$
\ce{CH3-C(=O)-C6H4-NO2}
$$
After step 2, if the acetophenone is acylated first on benzene (carbon 1), nitration should lead primarily to $m$-nitroacetophenone where the $\ce{NO2}$ group is at $3$ position relative to the acetyl group located at carbon 1. Thus, the main product still looks like $3\mathrm{-nitroacetophenone}$ ($\ce{CH3-CO-C6H4-NO2}$ where the $\ce{NO2}$ is meta to the $\ce{CH3CO}$ group).

Let us now brominate $3$-nitroacetophenone (which is also called $(3\mathrm{-nitrophenyl})ethan-1\mathrm{-one}$). Since nitrogen is already at the $3$ position (relative to carbonyl at position $1$), another electrophilic substitution such as bromination should be directed to position $5$ (another meta position relative to acyl group) or position $1$ (para position relative to the nitro group).

Thus, after:
$$
\ce{Benzene ->[CH3COCl, AlCl3] C6H5COCH3 ->[HNO3, H2SO4] m-C6H4(NO2)COCH3 ->[Br2, FeBr3] Br-C6H3(NO2)COCH3}
$$
However, another important reaction order might be:
1. Friedel-Crafts acylation: Place the acetyl group first.
2. Bromination (which should mostly give $m$-bromoacetophenone because the acyl group is a meta-directing group).
3. Nitrating such that:
$$
\ce{Benzene ->[CH3COCl, AlCl3] C6H5COCH3 ->[Br2, FeBr3] m-BrC6H4COCH3 ->[HNO3, H2SO4] NO2-C6H3(Br)COCH3}
$$
Another potential sequence could be reversed so that bromination is done first, yet Friedel-Crafts acylation might still allow the reaction to proceed correctly because bromine is an ortho-para director yet a deactivating group, so reactions might yield a substituted benzene bromination first might yield a mixture ($o$- and $p$-bromobenzene).

Prioritizing the most straightforward reaction sequence where the order of reactions should make sense through the directing groups, we need the bromine group at $3$ position relative to the acyl group which means:
1. $1$ position is where the acetyl group is attached.
2. $3$ position should be for the bromine.
3. nitro should be at $5$ position relative to the acetyl group.

The most likely sequence seems to be:

1. $\ce{CH3COCl}$ and $\ce{AlCl3}$ (acetylating benzene first because the benzene ring is initially very reactive for Friedel-Crafts reactions).
2. $\ce{HNO3}$ and $\ce{H2SO4}$ (positions the nitro group meta to the acetyl carbonyl).
3. $\ce{Br2}$ and $\ce{FeBr3}$ (positions bromine group such that given the nitro group already on ring, bromine goes to the other meta position relative to the acetyl group).

However, an alternative order might still require us to brominate first but again often Friedel-Crafts acylation works well on reactive benzene rings, so it makes sense that such a reaction should be done first.

However, an alternative reasoning might be:
1. $\ce{Br2}$ and $\ce{FeBr3}$:
$$
\ce{C6H6 + Br2
