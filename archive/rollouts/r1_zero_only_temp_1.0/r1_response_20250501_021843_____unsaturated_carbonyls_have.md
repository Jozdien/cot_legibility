# Original Question

α-β unsaturated carbonyls have a much more electrophilic carbon double bond. These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the β position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the β-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.
What are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?
dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)
1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)
C + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione

To solve for the reactions described in the question, let us recall what a Michael addition (also known as a conjugate addition) is. A Michael addition involves the addition of a nucleophile to the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (or another α,β-unsaturated electron-withdrawing group compound such as nitriles or nitro compounds).

The question mentions that when a nucleophile attacks the β-position of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, it leads to a resonance-stabilized intermediate known as an enolate. An enolate ion is a nucleophile formed by deprotonation of a carbonyl compound adjacent to the carbonyl group which creates a negatively charged carbon atom that can stabilize itself through resonance with the carbonyl group.

### Reaction for part A:

Reactants given are:
1. dimethyl malonate (CH2(COOCH3)2)
2. methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate (which looks like CH2=CH(COOCH3)-C6H4-CH3 where the "p-tolyl" part means a toluyl group (i.e., a methylbenzene group) where the methyl group is on the para position relative to the point of attachment).

However, the structure can be explicitly written out as:
$$
CH_2=C(COOCH_3)C_6H_4CH_3 \text{ where $C_6H_4CH_3$ is a p-tolyl group (also written as Ph-CH3 where Ph is phenyl and the CH3 is para to the point of attachment)}
$$
Thus, one valid structural formula for part (A) might be:
$$
\mathrm{(CH_3OOC)CH_2CH(COOCH_3)C_6H_4CH_3}
$$
However, it makes more sense here to organize the reaction properly.

The first part of reaction (A) involves dimethyl malonate (which has a structure of $\mathrm{CH_2(COOCH_3)_2}$) reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate under the conditions NaOEt and EtOH.

The main part of dimethyl malonate that acts as a Michael donor here is the methylene group (CH2) flanked by two ester groups (COOCH3), which makes it a "soft" nucleophile when deprotonated by a strong base such as NaOEt. The resulting carbanion is stabilized via resonance between both ester groups as follows:
$$
\mathrm{CH_2(COOCH_3)_2} + \text{NaOEt} \rightarrow \mathrm{^-CH(COOCH_3)_2} + \text{EtOH} + \text{Na^+}
$$
The deprotonated malonate (an enolate ion, specifically a stabilized carbanion) acts as a nucleophile and performs a Michael addition on the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate which has an α,β-unsaturated structure where the acrylate part looks like:
$$
\mathrm{CH_2=CH-COOCH_3}
$$
However, the question mentions that the "methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate" should be structured as:
$$
(4-\text{methylphenyl})-CH=CH-COOCH_3
$$
This structure should be verified: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate should correctly be represented structurally as:
$$
\mathrm{CH_δ^=}C(COOCH_{3})-δ\text{-}C_6H_4\text{-}CH_3
$$
However, another name verification makes us write it explicitly as:
$$
\mathrm{(E)-CH_3-C_6H_4-CH=CH-COOCH_3}
$$
which makes the α,β-unsaturated double bond be between β-carbon (attached to the p-tolyl group) and α-carbon (which is attached to the ester group).

However, in a Michael addition of the enolate of dimethyl malonate on methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the enolate of dimethyl malonate (produced by NaOEt) attacks the β-position of the unsaturated ester giving:
$$
\mathrm{(CH_3OOC)_2CH^- + CH_3-C_6H_4-CH=CH-COOCH_3} \\
\text{(nucleophile attacks β-position)} \rightarrow \mathrm{(CH_3OOC)_2CH-CH_2-CH(COOCH_3)C_6H_4-CH_3}
$$

The final product after proton quenching might be:
$$
\mathrm{(CH_3OOC)_2CH-CH_2-CH(COOCH_3)C_6H_4-CH_3}.
$$
To make sure we draw the structure accurately, it makes sense to make a step-by-step reasoning:

1. Deprotonation of dimethyl malonate by NaOEt gives an enolate:
$$
\mathrm{CH_2(COOCH_3)_2} \xrightarrow{\text{NaOEt, EtOH}} \mathrm{^-CH(COOCH_3)_2}
$$
2. Michael addition of the dimethyl malonate enolate to the β-carbon of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate:
$$
\mathrm{^-CH(COOCH_3)_2} + \mathrm{CH_3-C_6H_4-CH=CH-COOCH_3} \rightarrow\\
\mathrm{(CH_3OOC)_2CH-CH_2-CH(COOCH_3)-C_6H_4-CH_3}
$$
The major product (A) should thus be:
$$
\mathrm{(CH_3OOC)_2CH-CH_2-CH(COOCH_3)C_6H_4-CH_3}.
$$
Alternatively, in a more readable chemical structure:
$$
[(CH_3OOC)_2CH-CH_2-CH(COOCH_3)-C_6H_4-CH_3].
$$
### Reaction for part B:

The reactants given are:
1. 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine (which is a structure involving a cyclohexene ring where one of the double bonds is bonded to a piperidine group).
2. (E)-but-2-enenitrile (which is $\mathrm{CH_3-CH=CH-CN}$).

The reaction condition is MeOH with $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$, which suggests an acidic condition where a proton can be donated to protonate piperidine and make cyclohex-1-en-1-yl a nucleophile.

1. **1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine** has a structure where a cyclohexene ring is connected to a piperidine group (which is a six-membered ring with five carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom, $\mathrm{C_5H_{11}N}$) connected to the double bond:
$$
\mathrm{(C_5H_{10}N)-C_6H_9}
$$
Specifically, one representation might be:
$$
\ce{(C5H10N)Cyclohexenyl} \rightarrow \text{(the nitrogen atom connects to the carbon atom adjacent to the double bond in the cyclohexane ring)}.
$$
2. **But-2-enenitrile** is an α,β-unsaturated nitrile whose structure should be:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-CH=CH-CN}
$$
However, the question specifically mentions "(E)-but-2-enenitrile," so the double bond should have a trans configuration:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3CH=CHCN} \text{ (trans)}
$$
For part B, piperidine stabilizes the enamine formed from cyclohexanone where the reaction might be initially a bit complex. Usually, an enamine acts as a Michael donor where the "enamine" reaction might require a ketone or aldehyde such as cyclohexanone reacting with piperidine to form an enamine. However here, it seems that we already have an enamine-like structure where a nucleophilic double bond is part of cyclohex-1-en-1-yl connected to a piperidine.

However, here it seems that 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acts as an enamine (which serves as a nucleophile here). Michael addition reactions with enamines attack α,β-unsaturated carbonyls but here we should make sure what's happening specifically here:

Under $\mathrm{H_3O^+}$ conditions, hydrolysis of both the enamine and the nitrile might need to be considered where:
$$
\mathrm{(C_5H_{10}N)-C_6H_9 + CH_3CH=CHCN} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{MeOH, H_{3}O^+}} ?
$$
However, the enamine should act as a nucleophile here where the double bond in the cyclohexene part acts as a nucleophile which adds to the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile. After the Michael addition, hydrolysis of remaining functional groups should be considered.

Thus, the reaction should be:
$$
\text{(1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine) + (E)-but-2-enenitrile} \\
\text{(piperidine part might leave becoming cyclohexenyl anion attacking β-carbon of CH3-CH=CHCN)}\\
\Rightarrow\mathrm{CH_3-C_6H_{10}-CH_2-CH_2-CH_3-CN}
$$
However, after the reaction, the double bond part should need to be analyzed:
The nucleophilic part should be the part adjacent to the piperidine part which means the part on the cyclohexene carbon should attack the beta carbon (the double bond carbon far from the nitrile group) of (E)-but-2-enenitrile.

Thus, one possible attack:
$$
\text{[1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine]} \text{ (nucleophilic part of the double bond should attack)}\\
+ \text{(E)-but-2-enenitrile} \\
\Rightarrow \text{cyclohexenyl group binds to β-carbon }\\
(\beta\text{-carbon is already the second carbon from the nitrile group in terms of }CH_3-\beta-\alpha-CN)\\
\rightarrow\text{4-(cyanoethyl)cyclohexanone} \text{(since usually enamines hydrolyze back to ketones after attack)}
$$
A more structured stepwise reaction could be:
1. The enamine part attacks the β-carbon position of CH3-CH=CHCN.
2. Proton migration and hydrolysis should yield a cyclohexanedione chain connected where the nitrile function remains intact until further reaction steps (if hydrolysis occurs, it might convert the nitrile into a carboxylic acid but typically requires stronger conditions).

Thus, the answer should produce a compound where the cyclohexenyl part has been added to the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile, ultimately forming a compound such as $\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-CH(cyclohexane)-CH_2-CN}$ but we need the part where cyclohexane should be attached to the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl (which acts as a Michael acceptor). After hydrolysis of piperidine, we should get cyclohexanone instead of cyclohexenyl.

Thus, a plausible product should be:
$\mathrm{CH_3CH_2CH(C_6H_{10})CN}$ where $\mathrm{C_6H_{10}}$ represents cyclohexane with a double bond or carbonyl formation after subsequent steps such as hydrolysis.

Based on a simpler check, an enamine reaction should be:
$$
\text{(Enamine gives a ketone after aqueous workup)}
$$
An answer should thus probably contain cyclohexanone added to the β-carbon of acrylonitrile.

However, one plausible product could be:
$\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-CH(C_6H_{11})CN}$ should be:
$\mathrm{CH_3-CH_2-CH(C_5H_{10})CN}$ where the specific part $\mathrm{C_5H_{10}}$ should be a ring structure such as cyclohexyl but properly: $\mathrm{C_6H_{11}}$ would refer to a cyclohexyl group directly (loss of double bond probably due to protonation).

Hence, what looks reasonable here is:
$$
4-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexanone
$$
However, another rationalized product should be:
When hydrolysis occurs, the enamine group could be converted back to a ketone and a separate $\mathrm{H^{+}}$, so:
$$
3-(3-oxobutyl)piperidine
$$
However, this seems a bit off for our question. Another valid try would be:
$$
\mathrm{3-(1-oxocyclohexyl)propionitrile}
$$

Thus, another possible interesting candidate might be:
3-(1-piperidinocyclohexyl)propanenitrile could be made first which upon acidic hydrolysis yields 3-(1-oxocyclohexyl)propanenitrile.

### Reaction for part C:

The reaction provided mentions:
Reactant C reacts with but-3-en-2-one ($\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH_2-CO-CH_3}$) with conditions KOH and $\mathrm{H_2O}$, leading to the product 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. 

The target product is:
$$
\mathrm{2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione}
$$
with a structure where the "3-oxobutyl" part is attached to the second carbon of "cyclohexane-1,3-dione." 

Therefore, given the desired product is $2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione$, the structure for cyclohexane-1,3-dione itself is:
$$
\underset{\text{Cyclohexane-1,3-dione}}{C_6H_7(O)_2}
$$
with keto groups at the first and third carbon atoms of a cyclohexane:
$$
\mathrm{(CO-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CO}) \text{ where there is another keto group at carbon 3 besides carbon 1}.
$$
Another way to write it:
$$
\ce{C6H8O2} \text{ where the actual structure is } \ce{(OC-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2)}
$$
Thus, assuming "C" is the missing reactant here such that:
$$
\text{C + CH_2=CH-CH_2-CO-CH_3} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{KOH, H_{2}O}} 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.
$$
This implies that an α,β-unsaturated ketone ("but-3-en-2-one," commonly written as methyl vinyl ketone, which seems a bit erroneous here since but-3-en-2-one should be specifically structured as:
$$
\mathrm{CH_2=CH-CH_2-CO-CH_3}.
$$
However, the actual methyl vinyl ketone should be:
$$
\text{CH_2=CH-CO-CH_3}.
$$
Seems that "but-3-en-2-one" should be $\mathrm{CH_3-CO-CH=CH_2}$, thus let us make sure of the reaction. 

Our product is:
$$
2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.
$$
This means that a "3-oxobutyl" group (CH3COCH2CH2-) is connected at the 2-position of cyclohexane-1,3-dione. 

The compound "3-oxobutyl" means:
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-CO-CH_2-CH_2-}.
$$
To make the Michael addition reaction happen, the nucleophile should be an enolate formed from a compound that upon reacting with but-3-en-2-one forms what seems to be a Michael addition product where the nucleophile should be a part that eventually gives us the $2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione$ product.

Based on the question statement, the unknown compound "C" should be "cyclohexane-1,3-dione" itself. Butan-3-en-2-one acts as the Michael acceptor here where cyclohexane-1,3-dione forms an enolate at either the 2-position (between the two keto groups) and performs a Michael addition on the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one.

So, checking:
$$
\text{Cyclohexane-1,3-dione} \xrightarrow{\text{KOH}} \text{Enolate} \text{ (formed between C1 and C3 ketone groups at the C2 position)}
$$
Hence:
$$
\text{Cyclohexane-1,3-dione} \xrightarrow{\text{KOH}} \text{Cyclohexane-1,3-dione enolate ion}
$$
The enolate reacts with the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ketone (which is but-3-en-2-one in our case):
$$
\mathrm{(Enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione) + CH_2=CH-CH_2-CO-CH_3} \xrightarrow{\text{KOH}} 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
$$
To make sure that the addition occurs correctly, verify the reaction:
1. But-3-en-2-one is $CH_3-CO-CH=CH_2$, which makes the reaction proper as follows:
    - The enolate (carbon between the two carbonyl groups on cyclohexane-1,3-dione) adds to β-carbon of $CH_2=CH-CO-CH_3$.
Therefore, the reactant missing here ("C") should indeed be:
$$
\text{"Cyclohexane-1,3-dione."}
$$
Similar detailed reaction steps:
1. Cyclohexane-1,3-dione forms an enolate anion at the active methylene site (carbon position 2).
2. The enolate anion attacks the β-carbon of the but-3-en-2-one compound which is $CH_2=CH-CO-CH_3$ (not $CH_2=CH-CH_2-CO-CH_3$).
3. After the reaction, the product should be $2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione$, which makes sense if $\mathrm{C}$ is identified appropriately.

Considering the structures given in the question, the reactants thus should be identified as follows:

A: For the reaction involving dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt/EtOH, the product should be:
$$
\mathrm{(CH_3OOC)_2CH-CH_2-CH(COOCH_3)C_6H_4-CH_3}.
$$
Check again against the product (might already be sufficient here):
Hence, one possible final product could be:
$$
dimethyl 2-[methyl 3-(4-dimethylphosphanoyl)propanoate]malonate
$$

B: For the reaction involving 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine plus (E)-but-2-enenitrile with MeOH and $\mathrm{H^{+}}$ should solve to
