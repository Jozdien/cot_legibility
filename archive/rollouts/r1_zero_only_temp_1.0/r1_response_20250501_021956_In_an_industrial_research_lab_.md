# Original Question

In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

This question discusses the production of a branched polymer using a dual catalyst system where only ethylene is used as the reactant. The goal is to identify a valid statement regarding such a system where a polymer of high density is first generated by ethylene polymerization and then a second catalyst system is introduced to produce regular branches in the polymer backbone using only ethylene as a reactant.

Let us decode the statements mentioned:

1. "Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US."
    
2. For the second part of the question, "One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step."

3. The third part states, "Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive."

Let us recall what the question is aiming for:
- First, a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system is used for ethylene polymerization (generating high-density polyethylene, HDPE).
- Second, a second catalyst system is added to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone while still only using ethylene as a reactant.

This process describes the synthesis of a type of polymer called "linear low-density polyethylene" (LLDPE). However, LLDPE typically uses ethylene along with α-olefins such as 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene as comonomers to introduce branching. However, this question specifies that only ethylene is used here. 

Another well-known process that fits the description of using only ethylene is the synthesis of a "branched" polyethylene called "chain-walking polymerization" where a catalyst causes "chain-walking" so that the growing polymer chain can "walk" along the backbone, creating branches from ethylene alone (i.e., without the need for a comonomer).

Based on this, the question makes a reference to a well-known dual-catalyst system used for making branched polyethylene solely from ethylene. Such a process might need a tandem catalysis where one catalyst makes linear polyethylene while another introduces branching through a "chain-walking" mechanism.

To address the statements specifically:

(a) "Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US." To verify this, it is well known that around 2000, Dow Chemical introduced a process called INSITE technology which uses a dual metallocene catalyst where one catalyst produces high molecular weight chains (linear segments) while another produces low molecular weight chains with branches. However, it is usually done at lab scale or niche markets rather than a broad industrial scale. 

(b) "One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal." Group VIa transition metals are chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W). However, group VIa transition metals are typically used in Phillips catalyst systems for high-density polyethylene polymerization where aluminum-based activators (such as MAO methyl alumoxane) are common. However, the question mentions that aluminum-based activators do not work for the additional reaction step. Thus, one needs some catalyst system where aluminum-based activators do not operate in the second reaction step where regular branches are introduced. 

Another important part here is understanding what "specific activators" means. For chain-walking polymerization, late-transition metal catalysts such as nickel or palladium catalysts are often used because they can cause "chain walking."

(c) "Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive." Noble metals such as palladium or platinum could indeed be used for such polymerization reactions such as in metathesis reactions where chain transfer might happen. However, their high cost makes them less favorable for large-scale industrial processes.

Based on the points mentioned in the question, it seems that statement (b) is most likely incorrect because group VIa transition metals are not normally associated with tandem polymerization where one catalyst polymerizes ethylene into a high-density polymer and another introduces branches. 

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding here based on what's standard in practice such as with INSITE technology developed by Dow Chemical which utilizes "specific catalysts" such as metallocenes and late-transition metal catalysts (like nickel-based ones) may indeed be used for chain-walking.

However, an important part mentioned here is that "Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US." This implies that whatever process they are referring to should already exist on an industrial scale. 

Therefore, we need to verify the only true statement based on what seems most accurate. One such famous process might be the pioneering work by Brookhart using nickel catalysts or palladium catalysts exhibiting chain-walking behavior where only ethylene is used to make branched polyethylene. However, the "industrial-scale" part makes us lean towards a verified and widely-used process mentioned here should involve a dual-catalyst system where one makes linear polymer chains and another makes branched chains.

Considering the question statement seems to be built based on real-life industrial processes described here, statement "Combined systems producing a polymer with regular branches solely from ethylene have been implemented on an industrial scale in the US" seems to be a valid statement known as INSITE technology developed by Dow Chemical Company uses a dual catalyst system where one makes a linear part (high-density part) and one makes LLDPE which could be branched.

However, the part about group Vla catalysts (Group 6 in the periodic table such as Cr, Mo, W) could be a red herring as group Vla metals are typically used for catalysts making high-density polyethylene (HDPE).

So, the most accurate statement appears to revolve around the industrial implementation of a dual catalyst system (which is true for LLDPE, but usually with comonomers).

However, Dow's INSITE™ dual catalyst technology does fit the question's requirement such that:
**"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US." seems correct.**

Thus, the answer seems justified here is:

**Answer: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.**

Let's verify the other statement also:

Aluminum-based activators are indeed widely used in Ziegler-Natta and metallocene catalysts (they work well for initial ethylene polymerization), so saying that "aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step" doesn't necessarily make a statement incorrect. However, the question seems positioned so that the "correct" statement should indeed validate that such a second reaction step might need a different kind of activator.

Finally, noble metals can indeed be costly such that "Certain noble metal catalysts can moreover be used but are too expensive." sounds plausible as well but the intent seems more focused on what makes such tandem polymerization systems work industrially. Although noble metals being used may be true, it makes less sense when talking about a method already implemented on an industrial scale where cost-effectiveness matters.

Nevertheless, verified industrial processes such as those using nickel might already be in practice where nickel isn't a noble metal. Palladium might be another candidate here but is indeed a noble metal and costly. 

Based on all these, the most plausible statement seems to be:
“Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.”

Another valid point here is that this question seems to validate the real-life applications of such dual catalysts or tandem polymerizations where polyethylene with controlled branching can indeed be synthesized only from ethylene. 

Therefore, the answer should be verified based on what is known from industrial practice (which states that such systems indeed exist). However, it seems worth verifying whether the usage of such a system has indeed been implemented on an industrial scale in the US. 

This seems to indeed be the case as supported by the well-known LLDPE production process which uses a "dual catalyst system" where one part makes linear segments while the other makes brancheswithout the need for alpha-olefins such as hexene or octene (although in practice, such alpha-olefins are often used for comonomer). 

Therefore, for the question of reliability and accuracy above, statement "Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US." appears to be the most probably correct statement described in the question.

Thus ,conclusion verification shows:
The statement "Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive" is also valid but seems less relevant compared to the first statement ("Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.").

However, the question requires us to identify which specific statement is true based on provided options:
Thus, such combined systems are indeed already implemented on an industrial scale in the US for polymerization reactions wherein one catalyst makes a high-density polymer and another makes a branched structure from ethylene alone by a tandem catalyst system.

Once again, the first answer seems correct because:
1. They use nickel or palladium as part of the process (which makes the noble metal part true too, but the expensive part makes it a less ideal candidate for industrial scale).
2. Chromium molybdenum tungsten group might not align well with such reactions.
3. Aluminum-based activators don't work for the second part but work usually for the first part.

However, what can be verified is that the first statement makes a factual claim about such a process being already implemented industrially in the US.

However, the validity of the other statements requires a deep dive into higher-level chemistry literature and specific catalyst systems:

1. **Group VIa transition metals (Group 6):** Some industrial polyethylene processes do rely on Group 6 metals (specifically chromium), but this seems unrelated to branching here.
2. **Aluminum-based activators don't work for the essential additional reaction step:** MAO (methylaluminoxane) is indeed a common activator used often for metallocenes for ethylene polymerization but may not be used for the second catalyst if that step indeed requires a different activator.
3. **Certain noble metal catalysts:** They might be used theoretically, but "too expensive" makes it unlikely for large-scale industrial use.

Hence, the correct statement seems to be:
#### Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.

Thus, the reasoning leads us to a plausible statement being true here is:
"Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US." 

Considering such claims, the answer thus looks like:
Answer: Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.

Based on the overall context given on polymerization techniques and recognized industrial processes, the most directly supported claim seems indeed true.
