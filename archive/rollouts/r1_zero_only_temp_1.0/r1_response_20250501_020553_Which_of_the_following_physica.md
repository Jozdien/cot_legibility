To answer the question "Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?", we need to understand what it means for a physical theory to "require regularization at high energies."

Regularization is a process used in quantum field theory to make sense of divergent integrals that arise in perturbative calculations. For instance, many quantum field theories exhibit divergences in loop integrals which need to be regulated (i.e., made finite) so that meaningful physical predictions can be extracted. The regularization process usually introduces a "cutoff" which serves to make the integrals convergent until another process called "renormalization" is used to remove the cutoff dependency from observable quantities.

The question mentions three well-known physical theories:

(A) Classical mechanics
(B) Quantum mechanics
(C) Quantum field theory

1. **Classical Mechanics**:
    
    In classical mechanics, which describes the motion of macroscopic objects under the influence of forces, such as Newton's laws of motion and Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics, there is usually no need for regularization. The theory itself is formulated in a way that does not typically produce infinities that need to be "regularized." 

2. **Quantum Mechanics**:

    Quantum mechanics deals with the behavior of particles at microscopic scales where energy levels are quantized. While quantum superposition and wavefunction collapse can lead to complex calculations, such as calculating the ground state energy of a hydrogen atom which involves solving the Schrödinger equation, quantum mechanics itself typically does not need regularization. However, there are some situations where infinities might appear (like the "ultraviolet catastrophe" in the context of black-body radiation, which was actually resolved by the advent of quantum mechanics itself), but such cases usually led to the development of newer theories like quantum field theory where regularization becomes important.

3. **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**:

    Quantum field theory is a framework used in theoretical physics to construct models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. When QFT is used for high-energy (or equivalently, short-distance) processes, divergent integrals often appear in Feynman diagram calculations. Thus, QFT frequently requires regularization techniques such as Pauli-Villars regularization, dimensional regularization, or lattice regularization to make sense of these divergences.

Based on the reasoning above, the answer appears to be that both classical mechanics and quantum mechanics typically do not require regularization at high energies. However, classical mechanics is a description that does not directly involve any "high energy" scenarios where concepts like "particle creation," "high energy limits," or "ultraviolet divergences" make sense. Quantum mechanics handles "high energy" situations such as high-energy atomic transitions explicitly through well-defined Schrödinger or Dirac equations without the need for "regularization methods" that are usual in QFT.

However, an important point here is that "high energies" here refers primarily to very high energies where particle creation and annihilation become significant, which pushes us into the realm of special relativity and thus quantum field theory itself. Hence, an answer here should evaluate which theory among classical mechanics and quantum mechanics stays well-behaved at high energies without needing regularization.
    
Based on this reasoning, the question seems designed to make us identify that "quantum mechanics" could potentially require some form of "regularization" at high energies (such as in relativistic quantum mechanics where the Dirac equation handles high energies until we encounter pair creation which pushes us into quantum field theory). However, classical mechanics typically operates on a completely different scale where high-energy phenomena such as particle creation and relativistic velocities are not part of the theory's domain.

However, there seems to be a bit of a conceptual mistake within our discussion so far. What does "never requires regularization" mean here? Regularization is mainly a concept associated with divergences that arise in loop integrals within "quantum field theory." Thus, a more valid promise seems to be that "classical mechanics" never requires such "regularization," because it lacks major parts where such divergences might arise. 

However, a more thorough review seems necessary here. 

#### Additional verification:
 
Sometimes "high energy" might make us think of relativity where classical mechanics is replaced by "classical field theory," like Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism. However, even Maxwell's equations generally do not need "regularization" in the same way QFT does. 

However, the question seems to intend us to verify which among the given theories does not typically need "regularization." Given that quantum field theory clearly requires regularization for high-energy scales, it should be ruled out. 

Quantum mechanics itself should be analyzed here. Thus, the key part is that quantum mechanics inherently deals with non-relativistic particles (though the Dirac equation is a part of relativistic quantum mechanics, but that itself is a part of what is generally called "first-quantized" theory where fields are not yet quantized). Quantum mechanics is defined well for a fixed number of quantum particles where issues like "infinities" might require using techniques such as renormalization only in cases where particle interaction leads to potential divergences (which is again more aligned with quantum field theory).

However, as a rule of thumb, "quantum field theory uniquely requires both regularization and renormalization due to divergences." 

Based on the question, which mentions "never requires regularization at high energies," an intuitive answer seems to be:
A) Classical mechanics

However, this might be a trick question because "regularization" specifically refers to a technique used in quantum field theory where calculations often produce infinities unless a "regulator" is applied. Quantum mechanics for a fixed number of particles usually does not encounter such infinities unless one goes to the high energy limit where indeed, higher energy states need solving for but not "regularization."

However, a more valid response should be that classical mechanics never requires regularization at any energies—because classical mechanics does not usually deal with the kind of "high energy" regime where relativistic effects such as those in quantum field theory would necessitate such a process. 

Based on the train of reasoning, "Classical mechanics" seems never to need "regularization." However, what about "high energies" here? Historically, "high energy" phenomena are described adequately by quantum field theory where regularization is needed. However, classical mechanics does not really deal with "high energy" domains correctly because once energies become very high, classical mechanics itself is no longer an adequate description of reality (since it ignores quantum effects altogether).

Another part that makes sense here is that "classical mechanics" does not require "regularization" precisely because it does not need such mathematical treatment for high-energy limits where classical descriptions typically break down altogether. Yet, this makes us need to confirm our understanding here. Regularization aims to make sense of infinities in quantum field theory only because we need a "more valid" theory like QFT to deal with such energies where our previous theories break down.

Thus, a simpler answer might be:
**(A) Classical Mechanics**.

Considering that classical mechanics deals primarily with macroscopic scales and low velocities (compared to the speed of light), it typically does not require anything akin to the "regularization" used in quantum field theory. However, one should remember that classical mechanics breaks down at quantum scales where energies are sufficiently high (which may lead one to question what "high energies" mean here—they typically imply a case where classical mechanics is no longer valid).

However, we need a definite answer here. Another important part of the question seems to involve checking if "quantum mechanics" requires such a regularization at higher energies. 

## Another important part here is interpreting "high energies";

Let us recall that quantum mechanics does not need "regularization" unless it reaches a point where relativistic effects become important (which takes us to the Dirac equation for relativistic quantum mechanics) or where particle creation becomes important (which takes us into quantum field theory).

Thus, "quantum mechanics" for non-relativistic cases might therefore not need "regularization," but for "high energies" relativistic corrections will be needed; thus, there might be confusion here where "regularization" might still be a concept that does not directly belong to non-relativistic quantum mechanics but rather enters explicitly in quantum field theory.

Based on such reasoning, let us appropriately make a clear conclusion which seems to be:
Answer should be:

**Answer: (A) Classical mechanics.**

However, a bit of a more specific reasoning might make us question whether "quantum mechanics" itself requires such "regularization," which might be confusing. However, classical mechanics should never need regularization because it does not contain the "divergent" integrals that appear in QFT.

Therefore, "classical mechanics" seems correct indeed because:
(A) Classical mechanics works fine within its domain and does not typically involve divergences that need "regularization." 

Based on this answer verification, the answer appears solid. Consequently, "Classical mechanics" thus makes sense because:
1) It does not have self-interaction terms resulting in divergent integrals like QFT.
2) At extremely “high energies,” one might need special or general relativity (classical field theory), which still does not require "regularization" in the same technical sense as QFT.

However, such a question makes sure that "regularization" is a term most typically associated with "quantum field theory" where "high energies" and "divergent integrals" are a common scenario. Thus, "classical mechanics" seems most appropriate among the choices mentioned here.

However, the question seems a little bit ambiguous because "high energy" makes us think of a domain where classical mechanics might not hold valid anymore. However, the question asks about which theory never requires "regularization" at high energies. 

Despite that seeming paradox, one should discern that "never requires regularisation" makes us need to choose one among the three listed theories where "regularization" is not a part of the theory regardless of the energy scales. 

So, “never requires regularization” suggests that any high energy part classically described still does not need such a mathematical procedure used uniquely in quantum field theory. 

Based on such reasoning, answering "classical mechanics":

**Answer: A**
However, a close answer here could be:
**Answer: A**

Another answer might be justified by implying that "quantum mechanics" might still require some form of "relativistic corrections" or another sort of "correction" if "high energies" are encountered as it transitions into "relativistic quantum mechanics" (Dirac equation) where higher-order effects might falsify non-relativistic quantum mechanics. However, "classical mechanics" is well defined within its valid framework—even though fully "breaks down" at microscales where quantum mechanics takes over. 

Hence, the answer should be:
(A) Classical mechanics.
However, it seems like what your question is asking has been answered clearly based on the fact that "regularization" is a term closely tied to QFT and not classical mechanics or standard quantum mechanics for a fixed number of particles which are non-relativistic.

However, if context is needed, "classical mechanics" itself usually does not need a "high energy" condition because it usually breaks down at such scales where quantum mechanics or quantum field theory is used instead.

Thus choice **A**, "Classical mechanics," never requires such a mathematical procedure called regularization at high energies (or any energies, for that borough of physics).

Thus, the answer seems to be:
(A) Classical mechanics.
