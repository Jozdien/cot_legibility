To solve for the product formed through the given reactions, let us first recall the reaction steps:

1. **Treatment of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C** forms a light yellow solid labeled as product 1. Its 1H NMR spectrum has peaks at:
    
    - 4.79 (2H)
    - 2.41-2.23 (10H)
    - 1.94 (2H)
    
    Additionally, there is a characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O stretching).

2. **Product 1 is then heated with an excess of aluminum isopropoxide, Al(O-i-Pr)₃**. This reagent is typically used for the Oppenauer oxidation, which oxidizes secondary alcohols to ketones when used in such a way that the secondary alcohol is the limiting reagent. However, another well-known reaction where aluminum isopropoxide is used is the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley (MPV) reduction where aldehydes or ketones are reduced to alcohols when aluminum isopropoxide acts as a reducing agent where isopropanol serves as the hydrogen source. However, the question seems to imply that aluminum isopropoxide acts on a ketone here (because product 1 has a carbonyl group indicated by the IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹).
    
    However, the MPV reduction works in the reverse direction (oxidation) when an excess of another ketone (typically acetone) is present such that the equilibrium is pushed towards the oxidation of the secondary alcohol (resulting in the Oppenauer oxidation). However, the question mentions that aluminum isopropoxide itself is used in excess. This suggests that the MPV reduction might be the intended reaction here where a ketone could be reduced to an alcohol (since the question does not mention any other ketone such as acetone).

3. **Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide (DMS)**, which is an ozonolysis reaction followed by a reductive workup where DMS reduces the ozonide intermediates into carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes or ketones.

Let us reason through step-by-step.

#### Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C.

The structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is:
$$
\mathrm{(1,3-dibromoadamantane)}
$$
which has a bromine atom at positions 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. 

The adamantane structure itself looks like:
$$\begin{array}{c}
\raisebox{-1.5cm}{\chemfig{*6(--(<:[:90])(<:[:270])---(<:[:90])(<:[:270])-)}\hspace{10pt}\text{or its 3D structure is a "diamondoid" structure where three cyclohexane rings are fused in a chair conformation.}} \\
\end{array}$$
However, a simpler drawing focusing on the 1,3-dibromoadamantane structure could emphasize specific positions such that bromines are at positions numbered 1 and 3:
$$
\mathrm{C_{10}H_{14}Br_2}
$$
However, it's important to recall that adamantane has a structure such that there are four CH groups ("methine" group) and six CH₂ groups ("methylene" group), so the starting molecule might typically be presented as follows:
$$
\mathrm{(CH)_4(CH_2)_6Br_2}
$$
The question mentions that upon reaction with excess KOH heated to 240°C, product 1 is formed. 

A reaction of a vicinal dibromide or geminal dibromide with KOH typically leads to an elimination reaction where HBr is removed to form a double bond (dehydrohalogenation reaction). However, here, 1,3-dibromoadamantane means that there is a bromine atom attached to two carbon atoms which are not directly connected (separated by a carbon bridge). 

However, a strong base like KOH could first eliminate one HBr molecule from one of the bromine atoms forming a bromoalkene intermediate. Another elimination could remove another HBr but might require extreme forcing conditions such as high temperature (240°C mentioned here). Another possible mechanism here might be an intramolecular substitution where the bromine acts as a leaving group and another part of the molecule acts as a nucleophile. 

The given 1H NMR spectrum for product 1 shows peaks at:
- 4.79 (2H)
- 2.41–2.23 (10H)
- 1.94 (2H)
    
The characteristic IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group (typically for a ketone group because an aldehyde usually shows a peak near 1730–1720 cm⁻¹, but ketones are typically found at 1715 cm⁻¹ which is very close to the observed 1720 cm⁻ absorbance).

The 1H NMR peaks are described as:
- **4.79 (2H):** This peak is quite deshielded, which might suggest protons attached to a carbon which is next to a carbonyl group (i.e., α position to a carbonyl group which would result in a shift around 2–3 ppm usually, so 4.79 ppm seems a bit higher. Another possibility might be a olefinic proton which could be observed in that range however that does not fit with another part of IR data showing a carbonyl group).
- **2.41–2.23 (10H):** This wide multiplet for 10 protons could be due to a mixture of adamantane backbone methylenic (CH₂) protons which might be deshielded due to proximity to a carbonyl group or another electron-withdrawing group.
- **1.94 (2H):** Another set of 2 protons which could be another CH₂ group resonating in a slightly deshielded environment.

Based on the 1H NMR data, the total number of proton peaks sums up to:
$$
2H + 10H + 2H = 14H
$$
However, the original 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the molecular formula of $\mathrm{C_{10}H_{14}Br_2}$ (adamantane has a molecular formula of $\mathrm{C_{10}H_{16}}$, so by removing two hydrogens and adding two bromines, it stays $\mathrm{C_{10}H_{14}Br_2}$).

The aromatic adamantane ring should have only 14 hydrogens if we need to account for the initial dibromo compound which has a total of 14 hydrogens (excluding the Br atoms). Thus, the product formed should still have the same carbon backbone (same carbon count) which makes sense here because product 1 retains the same number of protons (14).

Another possible reaction could be an intramolecular substitution where one bromine acts as a leaving group for an SN2 reaction where the nucleophile is another bromine-attached carbon. However, a more likely reaction might be a base-induced double dehydrobromination which forms a bridgehead double bond if possible (Bredt's rule might need to be considered here—which states that a double bond cannot be formed at the bridgehead of a bridged ring system unless the rings are large enough).

However, such a reaction forms a unique product called homo-adamantane where a cyclopropane ring is fused onto the adamantane structure called "homo-adamantanone" which fits well with the presence of a carbonyl group (1720 cm⁻¹ in IR).

However, a well-known reaction step for removing two molecules of HBr might lead to another radical reaction forming a bridgehead double bond. However, in adamantane, bridgehead positions are highly strained (Bredt’s rule makes it unlikely for a stable compound to have a double bond at the bridgehead unless the rings are large enough). So another possibility here could be a ring opening reaction where one of the adamantane rings breaks open.

However, a more plausible reaction is that one of the bromines gets substituted by a hydroxyl group which could be subsequently oxidized (since reaction at high temperature with KOH could result in not only elimination but also substitution reactions where Br is substituted by OH). However, the reaction at 240°C makes an elimination reaction more likely. 

Another candidate for a product from 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH could be adamantanone ketonic structure:
$$
\mathrm{C_{10}H_{14}O}
$$
But this reaction requires a plausible mechanism where the second bromine is used elsewhere such as forming a cyclopropane ring such as in "Noradamantanone" structure transformation.

However, after verifying some valid reaction mechanisms such as an hydroxy group substitution or double bond formation might not fit perfectly well here. An alternative is that the reaction might be forming a compound called "cycloundecane ketone" if we interpret such reaction differently. Yet a well-known reaction might be forming homo-adamantane where adamantane would need an extra carbon forming a bridge between two carbon atoms forming a "homo-adamantane."

However, based on a well-known reaction, 1,3-dibromoadamantane can indeed be converted to homo-adamantaneketone through a reaction sequence involving dehydrohalogenation and possibly a rearrangement such as Wolff rearrangement where a diazoketone intermediate forms a bridgehead carbonyl function. 

However, a simple candidate for product 1 could be obtained by a reaction such:
$$
\mathrm{1,3-dibromoadamantane} \xrightarrow[\text{excess KOH, 240°C}]{} \text{Bicyclo-[3.3.2]decan-10-one}
$$
The most plausible product formed might be bicyclo-[3.3.2]decan-10-one (also called "homoadamantanone"), whose structure might propose a structure such as:

![Homo-adamantanone](https://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.202111.html)

However, a more likely candidate might be "bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,7-dione" which would still have only 14 hydrogen atoms because:
$$
\mathrm{C_9H_{14}O_2}
$$
But it seems a bit complex.

However, another plausible candidate is that heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH could result in an elimination reaction where one bromine atom is replaced by a hydroxyl group forming an alcohol which might be further oxidized to a ketone forming a structure such as bromo adamantanone where one Br remains while one is substituted by OH and oxidizes internally for forming homo-adamantanone structure.

#### Step 2: Reaction of Product 1 with Aluminum Isopropoxide

Given that product 1 has IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, it could be a ketone such as "homo-adamantanone" (since alcohol does not usually show IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹). 

Aluminum isopropoxide is a reducing agent in Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reductions where ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols. So, if product 1 is a ketone, product 2 should be a secondary alcohol formed by reducing the ketone group (unless we face a reverse reaction which requires another ketone as a hydrogen acceptor which is not the case stated).

#### Step 3: Ozonolysis of Product 2 followed by DMS workup.

The reaction of an alkene group with ozone (ozonolysis) typically converts it into a split carbonyl compound such as aldehydes or ketones upon reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide (DMS). However, product 2 is formed from a ketone that was reduced to an alcohol which means that there should be a new double bond formed for ozonolysis to make sense. 

A likely reaction here which leads to a potential alkene is via a dehydration process which might convert the secondary alcohol formed in step 2 back into an alkene, however this step seems a bit off. 

Thus, we need another mechanism which makes sense for step 3 with what we have in product 2. If product 2 is indeed a secondary alcohol such as "homo-adamantanol" (containing a -OH group), how should ozonolysis make sense? 

However, it seems like we need to verify what happens if homo-adamantanone is the correct candidate for product 1 where there is a carbonyl group. 

Another thing we need to deduce is the question part which asks about the **coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3**, excluding protons that exchange with deuterated solvent (typically OH, NH protons).

For analyzing here, the known steps are:
1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (carbony group present)
2. Product 1 (Ketone presumably) → product 2 (reduction by Al(O-i-Pr)₃ might give an alcohol)
3. Product 2 (alcohol) → ozone at -78°C → DMS workup → product 3

It seems what we need to examine is if ozonolysis reactions require an alkene as a reactant. Yet another ozonolysis-like reaction might apply here is an oxidative cleavage reaction where ozonolysis can react with hydroxyl groups where an oxidative cleavage occurs where ketones could be further split.

Therefore, it seems we need more specific information about a well-known reaction route here. However, a well-known reaction via reaction of alcoholic compounds with ozone might be oxidation where a secondary alcohol could be oxidized further to ketones by ozone. However, ozonolysis itself requires double bonds so here might be a mistake in such interpretation.

However stitching all steps together, interpreting that product 1 should be a ketone for which the most reasonable guess might be that instead of the required double bond for ozone cleavage, rather we need to consider what aluminum isopropoxide does to a ketone which is a Miraculously MPV reduction where ketones are reduced to secondary alcohols.

For example product 1 could be like:
$$
\mathrm{C_9H_{14}O}
$$
