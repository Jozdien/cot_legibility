To solve for the minimum uncertainty in the energy $\Delta E$ of an electron traveling with a speed $v = 2 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$ along the $x$-direction given that the uncertainty in the position $\Delta x$ is $0.1 \text{ nm}$, we need to use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. 

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle for position and momentum is given by:
$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
$$
where $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$ and $h$ is Planck's constant (approximately $6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}$). 

The question states that the uncertainty in the position is:
$$
\Delta x = 0.1 \text{ nm} = 0.1 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m} = 10^{-10} \text{ m}.
$$
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle thus gives us:
$$
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \Rightarrow \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
$$
We need to find the uncertainty in the energy $\Delta E$. The energy $E$ of a particle can be expressed as:
$$
E = \frac{p^2}{2m},
$$
where $p$ is the momentum of the particle and $m$ is the mass of the electron (approximately $9.109 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$). 

To find the uncertainty in the energy $\Delta E$, we need to find how a small change in momentum $\Delta p$ affects the energy $E$. For a small change in momentum $p \to p + \Delta p$, the new energy $E'$ is:
$$
E' = \frac{(p + \Delta p)^2}{2m} = \frac{p^2 + 2p\Delta p + (\Delta p)^2}{2m} = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{2p\Delta p}{2m} + \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m} = E + \frac{p\Delta p}{m} + \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
$$
The change in energy $\Delta E$ is thus:
$$
\Delta E = E' - E = \left(E + \frac{p\Delta p}{m} + \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}\right) - E = \frac{p\Delta p}{m} + \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
$$
However, for a "small" $\Delta p$, the first term $\frac{p\Delta p}{m}$ is usually dominant compared to the second term $\frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}$ (since $(\Delta p)^2$ is a second-order term in $\Delta p$). However, what we need here is a more rigorous way to find the "minimum" uncertainty in energy. 

However, a more common way to find the relation between $\Delta E$ and $\Delta p$ is by differentiating the energy $E$ with respect to $p$:
$$
E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \Rightarrow dE = \frac{2p}{2m} dp = \frac{p}{m} dp.
$$
This can be approximated for small changes as:
$$
\Delta E \approx \frac{p}{m} \Delta p.
$$
However, a more "precise" way to find the "uncertainty" in $E$ might be:
$$
\Delta E = \left|\frac{dE}{dp}\right| \Delta p = \left|\frac{p}{m}\right| \Delta p.
$$
However, the question requires us to find the "minimum" uncertainty in energy. Thus, we need to make sure that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is satisfied with equality for the "minimum" case:
$$
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
$$
We need to substitute this into the relation for $\Delta E$:
$$
\Delta E \approx \frac{p}{m} \Delta p = \frac{p}{m} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{p \hbar}{2m \Delta x}.
$$
However, the question states that the electron is traveling with a speed $v = 2 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$. The momentum $p$ can be calculated as:
$$
p = mv,
$$
where $m$ is the mass of the electron $m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$ and $v = 2 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$:
$$
p = (9.109 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}) \times (2 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) = 1.8218 \times 10^{-22} \text{ kg·m/s}.
$$
We need to substitute this back into the expression for $\Delta E$:
$$
\Delta E \approx \frac{p \hbar}{2m \Delta x} = \frac{(1.8218 \times 10^{-22} \text{ kg·m/s}) \times \hbar}{2 \times (9.109 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}) \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}}.
$$
However, recall that $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s}$:
$$
\Delta E \approx \frac{(1.8218 \times 10^{-22}) \times (1.054 \times 10^{-34})}{2 \times (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) \times 10^{-10}}.
$$
Calculating the denominator:
$$
2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \times 10^{-10} = 1.8218 \times 10^{-40} \text{ kg·m}.
$$
Calculating the numerator:
$$
1.8218 \times 10^{-22} \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34} = 1.9192 \times 10^{-56} \text{ kg·m}^2\text{·s}^{-1}\text{·J·s}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.9192 \times 10^{-56}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-40}} \approx 1.0534 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}.
$$
However, it seems that the reasoning here might need a double check. Another way to make a more "direct" connection might be to use the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for energy and time:
$$
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
$$
However, what we need here is a relation for $\Delta E$ explicitly. Another way to interpret the question is by using the relation:
$$
\Delta E = \frac{p}{m} \Delta p.
$$
However, another part of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is:
$$
\Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
$$
So, the "minimum" $\Delta p$ is:
$$
\Delta p_{\text{min}} = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
$$
We need to substitute this into the relation $\Delta E \approx \frac{p \Delta p}{m}$:
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{p}{m} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{p \hbar}{2m \Delta x}.
$$
We already know that $p = mv$, so:
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{(mv) \hbar}{2m \Delta x} = \frac{v \hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
$$
Plug in the given values:
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{(2 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) \times (1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J·s})}{2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}}.
$$
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{2 \times 10^8 \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}}.
$$
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{2.108 \times 10^{-26}}{2 \times 10^{-10}}.
$$
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{2.108 \times 10^{-26}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}.
$$
This is the same result as before. 

However, it makes sense to verify the units here:
$$
\frac{\text{m/s} \times \text{J·s}}{\text{m}} = \text{J}.
$$
So, the answer seems to be:
$$
\Delta E \geq 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}.
$$
However, it might be useful to convert this to electron volts (eV) where $1 \text{ eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$:
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{1.054 \times 10^{-16}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} \text{ eV} \approx 658.75 \text{ eV}.
$$
However, the question only asks for the uncertainty in energy in terms of joules. Thus, the answer should be:
$$
\Delta E \geq 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}.
$$
However, a round-off might make the answer:
$$
\Delta E \geq 1.05 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}.
$$
However, a more "precise" check might be to make sure that the non-relativistic treatment is valid here. The given velocity $v = 2 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$ is a significant fraction of the speed of light $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$ (specifically, $v \approx \frac{2}{3}c$). Thus, a relativistic treatment might be more appropriate here. 

The total energy $E$ in a relativistic context is given by:
$$
E = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}.
$$
However, the question seems to be using a non-relativistic treatment where $E = \frac{p^2}{2m}$. However, a more accurate way to find the total energy (including rest mass energy) is:
$$
E = \gamma mc^2,
$$
where $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$.

However, a more "practical" way to find the uncertainty in energy might be:
$$
\Delta E = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} \Delta p.
$$
For the relativistic case:
$$
E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4,
$$
so:
$$
2E \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = 2pc^2,
$$
$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{pc^2}{E}.
$$
However, $E = \gamma mc^2$, so:
$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{pc^2}{\gamma mc^2} = \frac{p}{\gamma m}.
$$
However, $p = \gamma mv$:
$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\gamma mv}{\gamma m} = v.
$$
Thus:
$$
\Delta E = v \Delta p.
$$
However, from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle:
$$
\Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\Delta E \geq v \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{v \hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
$$
This is the same as what we found previously in the non-relativistic case where:
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{v \hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
$$
However, the only difference here is that the relation $\Delta E = v \Delta p$ is derived from a relativistic energy-momentum relation. 

So, the answer should be verified again:
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{v \hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{(2 \times 10^8) \times (1.054 \times 10^{-34})}{2 \times 10^{-10}}.
$$
$$
= \frac{2.108 \times 10^{-26}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}.
$$
So, the answer seems consistent whether we use a non-relativistic or a relativistic treatment here. 

Thus, the minimum uncertainty in the energy $\Delta E$ of the electron is:
$$
\boxed{1.054 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}}.
$$
(which is approximately $1.05 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}$).

However, a round-off error might make us round the answer to $1.05 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}$.

However, a more "intuitive" check can be done by directly using the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for energy and time:
$$
\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
$$
However, here $\Delta t$ can be interpreted as the time it takes for the electron to travel a distance of $\Delta x$:
$$
\Delta t = \frac{\Delta x}{v}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t} = \frac{\hbar}{2 \left(\frac{\Delta x}{v}\right)} = \frac{v \hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
$$
This is the same as what we found previously. 

Thus, the answer seems well verified.

$$
This is the same as what we found previously. 

Thus, the answer seems well verified. 

However, a round-off error might make us round the answer to $1.05 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}$.

Thus, the answer should be verified once again:
$$
\Delta E \geq \frac{v \hbar}{2 \Delta x} = \frac{(2 \times 10^8) \times (1.054 \times 10^{-34})}{2 \times 10^{-10}}.

Thus, the minimum uncertainty in the energy $\Delta E$ of the electron is:

\boxed{1.05 \times 10^{-16} \text{ J}}.
$$
(which is approximately $658.75 \text{ eV}$ if you need it in electron volts).
