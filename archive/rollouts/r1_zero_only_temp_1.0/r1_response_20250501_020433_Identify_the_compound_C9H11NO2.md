Based on the given IR and NMR data, let us analyze potential functional groups and structural fragments for a compound with a molecular formula of $\text{C}_9\text{H}_{11}\text{NO}_{2}$.

### Molecular Formula Analysis
Calculating the degree of unsaturation (also known as double bond equivalents, DBEs) for $\text{C}_9\text{H}_{11}\text{NO}_2$:

$$
\text{Degree of unsaturation} = \frac{2 \times 9 + 2 + 1 - 11}{2} = \frac{18 + 2 + 1 - 11}{2} = 5
$$
This means the compound could have a combination of rings and double bonds totaling to 5 (e.g., benzene ring accounts for 4 of those due to its three double bonds and one ring, i.e., a DBE of 4).

### IR Data:
- Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm$^{-1}$ and 3325 cm$^{-1}$:
    - These bands typically correspond to N-H stretching vibrations. The fact that there are two bands suggests a primary amine (asymmetric and symmetric N-H stretches).

- Strong band at 1720 cm$^{-1}$:
    - This band usually corresponds to a C=O stretch of a carbonyl group such as an ester or a ketone. However, for a simple ketone, the C=O stretch usually appears around 1715 cm$^{-1}$, while an ester typically shows up between 1735-1750 cm$^{-1}$, but a value of 1720 cm$^{-1}$ could still be in the range for a ketone or a conjugate carbonyl might lower the frequency slightly such as in an amide or an ester.

### 1H NMR Data:
- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H):
    - A triplet that integrates for 3 protons typically corresponds to a methyl group ($\text{CH}_3$) bonded to a methylene group ($\text{CH}_2$); the apparent triplet splitting pattern is due to coupling to the two protons on the adjacent methylene group (which shows a quartet).
    
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):
    - A broad singlet integrating for two protons is often indicative of an amine group (-NH$_{2}$); the broadness suggests NH protons (which can exchange with other protons such as those from water).

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H):
    - A quartet that integrates for two protons is typically indicative of a methylene group ($\text{CH}_{2}$) bonded to a methyl group which appears as a triplet at 1.20ppm. The chemical shift of 4.5 ppm suggests that the methylene may be adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen (such as in an ester group $\text{CH}_2\text{O}-\text{C=O}$), thereby deshielding the protons and causing a downfield shift.

- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H):
    - A doublet that integrates for two protons is indicative of two protons on an aromatic ring where there is one coupling neighbor (which means another aromatic proton). 

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H):
    - Another doublet that integrates for two protons also indicates two aromatic protons coupled to one neighboring proton on the aromatic ring.

#### Interpreting aromatic protons:
    
Given that there are two doublets that integrate for two protons each at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, it appears that the compound has a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring where the two substituents cause a symmetric splitting pattern where two protons appear as a doublet at 7.0 ppm (possibly the two protons ortho to the less electronegative substituent) and two protons appear as a doublet at 8.0 ppm (possibly the two protons ortho to the more electronegative substituent).

Considering the chemical shift differences:
- Protons appearing at 7.0 ppm are shielded compared to those at 8.0 ppm.The 8.0 ppm doublet indicates that those aromatic protons are closer to an electronegative group such as a carbonyl carbon (which deshields the aromatic protons ortho to it).

Based on the 1H NMR data, the compound appears to contain an ethyl group (1.20 ppm triplet for CH$_3$ and a 4.5 ppm quartet for CH$_2$) where the methylene group is likely bonded to an oxygen atom (thus forming an -$\text{OCH}_2\text{CH}_3$ moiety). 

Combining these fragments, a likely candidate might be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Total signal integration adds to }3(\text{triplet}) + 2(\text{broad singlet}) + 2(\text{quartet}) + 2(\text{doublet}) + 2(\text{doublet}) = 11 \text{ protons in total.} \\
&\text{This agrees with the molecular formula } \text{C}_9\text{H}_{11}\text{NO}_2 \text{ which indicates 11 hydrogens.}
\end{aligned}
$$
Let us try to make a compound based on the given information:
1 - An amine group from the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (integrating as 2 protons).
2 - An ethyl group where the methyl part appears as a triplet at 1.20 ppm and the methylene part shows up as a quartet at 4.5 ppm which indicates that the methylene group is bonded to an oxygen atom (as the chemical shift is quite downfield).
3 - A para-disubstituted benzene ring where the two sets of protons appear as doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.

So, putting all together, a potential structure could be "para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester" (also known as benzocaine which has the molecular formula $\text{C}_9\text{H}_{11}\text{NO}_{2}$):

$$
\text{(H}_2\text{N}C_6\text{H}_4\text{COOCH}_2\text{CH}_3\text{)}
$$
This should be specifically:
$$
\text{H}_2\text{N}-\text{C}_6\text{H}_4-\text{COOCH}_2\text{CH}_3.
$$
This structure makes sense:
- $\text{NH}$ stretch around 3420 cm$^{-1}$ and 3325 cm$^{-1}$ confirms an amine group.
- The strong band at 1720 cm$^{-1}$ is characteristic of a C=O stretch from an ester.
    
#### Verification:
Let us break down the 1H NMR for the suggested structure (para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester or benzocaine):

1. The $\text{CH}_3$ part of the ethyl group should appear as a triplet at a chemical shift of around 1.2-1.4 ppm due to the adjacent $\text{CH}_2$ group (splits into a triplet due to two neighboring protons).
2. The $\text{NH}_2$ protons should appear as a broad singlet typically somewhere between 3 to 6 ppm; here, they are found at 4.0 ppm.
3. The $\text{CH}_2$ part of the ethyl group should appear as a quartet around 4.5 ppm due to the adjacent methyl group and since it is next to an oxygen atom (deshielding effect).
4. For the benzene ring in para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester structure, the aromatic ring part should have two doublets due to the 1,4-disubstitution and the differing substitution positions (ester and amine); typically, the protons ortho to the carbonyl group (hence deshielded) resonate at a higher chemical shift compared to the protons ortho to the amine group (which shields the protons).

Based on the order described for the 1H NMR signals:
$$
\text{H}_3\text{C}-\text{CH}_2-\text{O}-\text{CO}-\text{C}_6\text{H}_4-\text{NH}_2
$$
The symmetry makes only two sets of doublets for the aromatic protons. The protons adjacent to the ester group should be around 7.9-8.2 ppm (this corresponds to the 8.0 ppm doublet in the given NMR data), while the protons adjacent to the amine group should be around 6.5-6.9 ppm (this corresponds to the 7.0 ppm doublet).

Therefore, the compound can be painstakingly identified as:
$$
\text{Ethyl p-aminobenzoate (benzocaine)}
$$
whose structure is shown as follows:
$$
\ce{O=C(OC2H5)-C6H4(NH2)}
$$
This fits well with the given molecular formula $\text{C}_9\text{H}_{11}\text{NO}_2$ and the given spectroscopic data.

Below is the structural formula you can write explicitly:
$$
\ce{H2N-\underset{1}{\overset{4}{\underset{|}{\underset{3\text{(7.0 ppm d, 2H)}}{C}}}6H}-\overset{2}{\underset{5\text{(8.0 ppm d, 2H)}}{C}}H-\underset{3}{\overset{6}{\underset{|}{\underset{5\text{(7.0 ppm d, 2H)}}{C}}}H}-\overset{4}{\underset{1}{\underset{6\text{(8.0 ppm d, 2H)}}{C}}}H\underset{}{\overset{\underset{\text{O}}{\underset{\parallel\text{ (1720 cm$^{-1}$)}}{C}}-\text{O}-\text{CH}_2\text{-CH}_3\text{(CH}_2 \text{ at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)), } \text{CH}_3 \text{ at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H)}}}{}}}
}
$$
However, a more organized structure for benzocaine (Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) would be:

$$\ce{H2N-\underset{}{\underset{\raisebox{0.5mm}{\text{(7.0 ppm d, 2H)}}}{}\underset{|}{\overset{}{C}}6H}-\underset{}{\underset{\raisebox{0.5mm}{\text{(8.0 ppm d, 2H)}}}{}\overset{}{C}}H-\underset{}{\underset{} \underset{|}{\overset{}{C}}H}-\underset{}{\underset{}{\underset{}{\overset{}{C}}}H}\underset{}{\overset{\underset{\text{O}}{\underset{\parallel }{C}}-\text{O}-\text{CH}_2\text{-CH}_3}{}}$$
Also, the question makes sense when the "4.05ppm (bs, 2H)" part corresponds to the amino group protons whose chemical shifts can indeed be broad and can vary based on solvent and concentration. Thus, the compound "benzocaine" fits well here.
