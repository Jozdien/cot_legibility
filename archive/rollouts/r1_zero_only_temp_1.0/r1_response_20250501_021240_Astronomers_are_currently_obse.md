# Original Question

Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?

To solve for the given question, we need to compare the flux variation caused by star spots on one hemisphere of a star to the flux variation caused by a transiting exoplanet blocking part of the star's light.

The question states that one hemisphere of a star (which has a radius $R_{\text{star}}$ equal to that of the Sun $R_{\odot}$) is covered with dark spots which have a filling factor of $20\%$. The effective temperature ($T_{\text{eff}}$) of the star is $6000K$, and the spots have a temperature difference ($\Delta T_{s}$) of $1000K$, which means that the spots themselves have a temperature of:
$$
T_{\text{spots}} = T_{\text{eff}} - \Delta T_{s} = 6000 \text{ K} - 1000 \text{ K} = 5000 \text{ K}.
$$
Note that $T_{\text{eff}}$ represents here the "normal" or "unspotted" part of the star's surface has an effective temperature of $6000 \text{ K}$. However, what we need here is actually an "average effective temperature" of the star where one hemisphere is partly covered with spots.

#### Step 1: Determine the filling factor and its location.
The filling factor $f$ is given as $20\%$, i.e., $f = 0.2$. We need to analyze half of the star where one hemisphere is covered by spots such that $20\%$ of that hemisphere's area is covered with spots. 

Total surface area of the star (which is spherical with radius $R_{\odot}$) is:
$$
A_{\text{total}} = 4 \pi R_{\odot}^2.
$$
The surface area of one hemisphere (half that of the total surface area) is:
$$
A_{\text{hemisphere}} = 2 \pi R_{\odot}^2.
$$
We are given that $20\%$ of this hemisphere is covered by spots:
$$
A_{\text{spots}} = 0.2 \times A_{\text{hemisphere}} = 0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\odot}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\odot}^2.
$$
The remaining surface area of the "normal" part of the star is thus:
$$
A_{\text{normal}} = A_{\text{total}} - A_{\text{spots}} = 4 \pi R_{\odot}^2 - 0.4 \pi R_{\odot}^2 = 3.6 \pi R_{\odot}^2.
$$
However, it seems like this reasoning might need a bit of clarification. 

#### Step 2: Define areas explicitly for covered versus uncovered parts.
The question mentions that one hemisphere has spots covering $20\%$ of that hemisphere. So, another way to divide the total surface area might be:
1. The "spotty" hemisphere covers $2 \pi R_{\odot}^2$ in total, so:
    
    - Spot-covered part of that hemisphere: $0.2 \times 2 \pi R_{\odot}^2 = 0.4 \pi R_{\odot}^2$.
    - Normal part of the "spotty" hemisphere: $0.8 \times 2 \pi R_{\odot}^2 = 1.6 \pi R_{\odot}^2$.
    
2. The other hemisphere is entirely normal and has an area of:
$$
2 \pi R_{\odot}^2.
$$

Total surface area is still $4 \pi R_{\odot}^2$, which we decompose as follows:
$$
A_{\text{total}} = 4\pi R_{\odot}^2 = (0.4\pi R_{\odot}^2)_{\text{spots}} + (1.6\pi R_{\odot}^2 + 2\pi R_{\odot}^2)_{\text{normal}}.
$$
So, total area where there are spots is:
$$
A_{\text{spots}} = 0.4 \pi R_{\odot}^2.
$$
Total area where there is no spotting (i.e., normal part of the star at $T_{\text{eff}}$ = $6000 \text{ K}$):
$$
A_{\text{normal}} = 1.6 \pi R_{\odot}^2 + 2 \pi R_{\odot}^2 = 3.6 \pi R_{\odot}^2.
$$

#### Step 3: Effective luminosity calculation for the normal part and the spots part.
Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity $L$ from a surface area $A$ with temperature $T$ is:
$$
L = A \sigma T^4,
$$
where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 

Total luminosity from the normal part (which has an area of $3.6 \pi R_{\odot}^2$ and a temperature $T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \text{ K}$):
$$
L_{\text{normal}} = (3.6 \pi R_{\odot}^2) \sigma (6000)^4.
$$
Total luminosity from the spot-covered part (which has an area of $0.4 \pi R_{\odot}^2$ and a temperature $T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \text{ K}$):
$$
L_{\text{spots}} = (0.4 \pi R_{\odot}^2) \sigma (5000)^4.
$$
Total luminosity of the star (which is the sum of these two luminosities):
$$
L_{\text{total}} = (3.6 \pi R_{\odot}^2) \sigma (6000)^4 + (0.4 \pi R_{\odot}^2) \sigma (5000)^4.
$$
$$
L_{\text{total}} = \pi R_{\odot}^2 \sigma \left[(3.6 \times (6000)^4) + (0.4 \times (5000)^4)\right].
$$
Thus:
$$
L_{\text{total}} = \pi R_{\odot}^2 \sigma \left[3.6 \times (6000)^4 + 0.4 \times (5000)^4\right].
$$
Let us calculate the "total" effective temperature $T_{\text{total}}$ such that:
$$
L_{\text{total}} = (4 \pi R_{\odot}^2) \sigma T_{\text{total}}^4.
$$
Equating both total luminosity expressions:
$$
4 \pi R_{\odot}^2 \sigma T_{\text{total}}^4 = \pi R_{\odot}^2 \sigma \left[3.6 \times (6000)^4 + 0.4 \times (5000)^4\right],
$$
$$
4 T_{\text{total}}^4 = 3.6 \times (6000)^4 + 0.4 \times (5000)^4,
$$
$$
T_{\text{total}}^4 = \frac{3.6 \times (6000)^4 + 0.4 \times (5000)^4}{4}.
$$
Calculate $(6000)^4$ and $(5000)^4$:
$$
(6000)^4 = (6\times10^3)^4 = 1296\times10^{12} = 1.296 \times 10^{15},
$$
$$
(5000)^4 = (5\times10^3)^4 = 625\times10^{12} = 6.25 \times 10^{14}.
$$
Thus:
$$
T_{\text{total}}^4 = {{\frac{3.6 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15} + 0.4 \times 6.25 \times 10^{14}}{4}}},
$$
$$
T_{\text{total}}^4 = \frac{3.6 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15} + 0.4 \times 6.25 \times 10^{14}}{4} = \frac{(3.6 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15}) + (0.4 \times 0.625 \times 10^{15})}{4} = \frac{(4.6656 \times 10^{15}) + (0.25 \times 10^{15})}{4} \\
= \frac{(4.6656 \times 10^{15}) + (0.25 \times 10^{15})}{4} \text{(previous calculation seems incorrect, verify individually)}.
$$
Calculate:
$$
3.6 \times (6000)^{4} \approx 3.6 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15} = 3.6 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15} = 4.6656 \times 10^{15}.
$$
$$
0.4 \times (5000)^4 = 0.4 \times 6.25 \times 10^{14} = 2.5 \times 10^{14}.
$$
Thus:
$$
T_{\text{total}}^4 = \frac{((4.6656 + 0.25) \times 10^{15})}{4} = \binom{4.6656 \times 10^{15} + 0.25 \times 10^{15}}{4}.
$$
Let us add the luminosities correctly:
$$
T_{\text{total}}^4 = \frac{4.6656 \times 10^{15} + 0.25 \times 10^{15}}{4}.
$$
Looks like there was a numerical mistake in our calculations previously. We need to correctly add $4.6656 \times 10^{15}$ and $2.5 \times 10^{14}$. However, note that:
$$
2.5 \times 10^{14} = 0.25 \times 10^{15}.
$$
Thus:
$$
T_{\text{total}}^4 = \frac{(4.6656 + 0.25) \times 10^{15}}{4}.
$$
$$
\approx \frac{4.9156 \times 10^{15}}{4}.
$$
$$
= 1.2289 \times 10^{15}.
$$
$$
T_{\text{total}} = (1.2289 \times 10^{15})^{1/4}.
$$
$$
= (1.2289 \times 10^{15})^{1/4} \approx 1.2289^{1/4} \times (10^{15})^{1/4}.
$$
$$
\approx 1.2289^{1/4} \times 10^{15/4} \approx 1.053 \times 10^{15/4}.
$$
$$
10^{15/4} = 10^{3.75} \neq 10^{15/4}.\text{ Incorrect here, we need instead:}
$$
$$
T_{\text{total}}^4 = 1.2289 \times 10^{15} \text{, so instead we need to solve for $T_{\text{total}}$ directly}:
$$
$$
T_{\text{total}} = (1.2289 \times 10^{15})^{1/4} \approx (1.2289)^{1/4} \times 10^{15/4} \text{, where $10^{15/4} = 10^{3.75}$ is incorrect here. Instead, first round $1.2289 \times 10^{15}$:
$$
1.2289 \times 10^{15} \text{ should be split wisely:}
$$
$$
T_{\text{total}}^4 = \frac{3.6 \times (1296 \times 10^{12}) + 0.4 \times (625 \times 10^{12})}{4} \\
= \frac{3.6 \times 1296 \times 10^{12} + 0.4 \times 625 \times 10^{12}}{4} \\
= \frac{4665.6 \times 10^{12} + 250 \times 10^{12}}{4} \\
= \frac{4915.6 \times 10^{12}}{4} \\
= 1228.9 \times 10^{12} = 1.2289 \times 10^{15}.
$$
Take the fourth root:
$$
T_{\text{total}} = (1.2289 \times 10^{ifteen})^{1/4} = (1.2289)^{1/4} \times
