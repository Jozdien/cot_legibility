# Original Question

How many of the stars listed below would be detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph, when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory? A star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure is achieved.

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us.
d) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us.
e) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.
f) Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us.

To solve for the detectability of the given stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on one of the 8m VLT telescopes at the Paranal Observatory, we need to check the provided link for the ESPRESSO spectrograph specifications. However, the question states that a star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved during a 1-hour exposure.

The question mentions that a star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved during a 1-hour exposure. However, the question does not directly provide us with a formula or a specific "limiting magnitude" for the ESPRESSO spectrograph when used with an 8m VLT telescope. However, a common way to solve for the limiting magnitude for a given S/N ratio is by using the following relation:

$$
S/N \propto \sqrt{t} \times F,
$$
where $t$ is the exposure time (which is given as 1 hour here) and $F$ is the flux received from the star. The flux $F$ itself is proportional to the apparent brightness of the star.

The question mentions that a star is considered detectable if a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel is achieved during a 1-hour exposure. Another important part of the question is that the star should be "detectable" if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel. 

However, a more common way to express the S/N for a given star is:
$$
S/N \propto \frac{F}{\sqrt{F + B + D}},
$$
where $F$ is the flux from the star itself, $B$ is the background flux (which includes sky background and other sources of noise), and $D$ is the dark current. However, for bright stars, the dominant term is usually $F$, so $S/N \propto \sqrt{F}$.

However, a more intuitive way to solve for the "limiting magnitude" might be to check the "limiting magnitude" for a given S/N ratio and exposure time. However, a more common way to solve for the limiting magnitude is by using the "limiting magnitude" for a given S/N ratio and exposure time.
