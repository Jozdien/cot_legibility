To solve for the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ in the given Lagrangian term:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
$$
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_{\mu}, \gamma_{\nu}]$, we need to make sure that the action $S$ is dimensionless (in natural units where $\hbar = c = 1$, the action has dimensions of $[S] = 0$). Since $S = \int d^4x \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$, the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have a mass dimension of $4$ (since $[d^4x] = -4$ in mass dimension, so $[\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}] = 4$).

To find the mass dimension of $\kappa$, we need to find the mass dimensions of the other terms in the Lagrangian term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$.

1. The mass dimension of a Dirac field $\psi$ is $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$. This is because the kinetic term in the Dirac Lagrangian is $\bar{\psi} (i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m) \psi$, where the term $\bar{\psi} i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi$ should have a mass dimension of $4$ (since it is part of the Lagrangian density). The derivative $\partial_\mu$ has mass dimension $1$ (since $\partial_\mu \sim \frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}$ where $[x^\mu] = -1$, so $[\partial_\mu] = 1$), and the gamma matrices $\gamma^\mu$ are dimensionless. Thus, the term $\bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi$ has a mass dimension of $[\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + 1$ (since $[\gamma^\mu] = 0$). Since $\bar{\psi} = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0$, $[\bar{\psi}] = [\psi]$, so:
$$
[\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + 1 = 2[\psi] + 1.
$$
This should be equal to $4$ (since the term is part of the Lagrangian density which has mass dimension $4$):
$$
2[\psi] + 1 = 4,
$$
which implies:
$$
[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}.
$$
Similarly, $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.

2. The mass dimension of the electromagnetic field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ is $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$. This is because $F^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu$, where $A^\mu$ is the electromagnetic vector potential. The mass dimension of $A^\mu$ is $[A^\mu] = 1$ (which can be seen from the kinetic term $-\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ in the Lagrangian, which should have a mass dimension of $4$: $[F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}] = 4$, so $2[F_{\mu\nu}] = 4$, which implies $[F_{\mu\nu}] = 2$). Another way to see this is:
$$
[F^{\mu\nu}] = [\partial^\mu A^\nu] = [\partial^\mu] + [A^\nu] = 1 + [A^\mu].
$$
However, we need to verify the mass dimension of $A^\mu$ explicitly. The term $-\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ expands as:
$$
-\frac{1}{4} (\partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu) (\partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu).
$$
The part $F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ thus has a mass dimension of:
$$
[F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}] = 2[F_{\mu\nu}] = 4,
$$
so:
$$
[F_{\mu\nu}] = 2.
$$
Since $F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$, and $[\partial_\mu] = 1$, it follows that:
$$
[F_{\mu\nu}] = 1 + [A_\mu] = 2,
$$
which implies:
$$
[A_\mu] = 1.
$$

3. The term $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] = \frac{i}{2}(\gamma_\mu \gamma_\nu - \gamma_\nu \gamma_\mu)$ has a mass dimension of $0$ because the gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$ are dimensionless (since the Dirac equation is $i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - m \psi = 0$, the term $i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi$ should have a mass dimension of $3/2 + 1 = 5/2$, which means that $\gamma^\mu$ must be dimensionless so that $[\gamma^\mu] = 0$). Thus:
$$
[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0.
$$

4. Using the given interaction Lagrangian term:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
$$
we need to find the mass dimension of $\kappa$. The mass dimension of the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
$$
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}].
$$
We already know that $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$, $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$, and $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$. Thus:
$$
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
$$
Since the Lagrangian density should have a mass dimension of $4$, the term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ should also have a mass dimension of $4$:
$$
[\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}] = [\kappa] + [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 4.
$$
We already found that $[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 5$, so:
$$
[\kappa] + 5 = 4,
$$
which implies:
$$
[\kappa] = -1.
$$
Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$.

#### Is the theory renormalizable?

To check if the theory is renormalizable, we need to verify the superficial degree of divergence $D$ for a general Feynman diagram in this theory. The superficial degree of divergence $D$ for a diagram in $4$ dimensions can be given by:
$$
D = 4 - E_B - \frac{3}{2} E_F,
$$
where $E_B$ is the number of external boson lines (in this case, photons) and $E_F$ is the number of external fermion lines (in this case, $\psi$ fields). However, a more common form for the superficial degree of divergence $D$ for a theory with multiple interaction terms is given by:
$$
D = 4 - E_B - \frac{3}{2} E_F - \sum_i d_i V_i,
$$
where $V_i$ is the number of vertices of type $i$ and $d_i$ is the mass dimension of the coupling constant associated with that vertex. 

However, a more well-known form for the superficial degree of divergence $D$ for a theory with a single interaction term is:
$$
D = 4L - E_B - \frac{3}{2} E_F + \sum_i d_i V_i,
$$
where $L$ is the number of loops. However, a more standard way to express $D$ is:
$$
D = 4 - \sum_{f} N_f \left(d_f - 1\right) - \sum_{b} N_b \left(d_b - 1\right) - \sum_i n_i \delta_i,
$$
where $N_f$ is the number of external fermion lines (with $d_f$ being the dimension of the fermion field, which is $3/2$), $N_b$ is the number of external boson lines (with $d_b$ being the dimension of the boson field, which for $A^\mu$ is $1$), and $n_i$ is the number of vertices of type $i$ where $\delta_i$ is the "dimension" of the vertex (which is $4 - d_i$, where $d_i$ is the mass dimension of the interaction term).

However, a more intuitive way to check renormalizability is by analyzing the mass dimension of the coupling constant. A theory is usually renormalizable if all coupling constants have a mass dimension that is greater than or equal to zero. 

However, a more well-known criterion for renormalizability is that a theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a mass dimension that is non-negative. A coupling constant with a negative mass dimension (such as $\kappa$ here, which has a mass dimension of $-1$) typically makes the theory non-renormalizable.

However, a more rigorous way to check renormalizability is by analyzing the superficial degree of divergence $D$ explicitly. For a diagram with $V$ vertices (of the given interaction), $I_B$ internal boson lines (photon lines), $I_F$ internal fermion lines, $E_B$ external boson lines, and $E_F$ external fermion lines, the superficial degree of divergence can be computed as follows:

1. The interaction term has three fields (two fermions and one photon field), so it is a three-point vertex where $V$ is the number of vertices.
2. The number of loops $L$ is given by:
$$
L = I_B + I_F - V + 1.
$$
3. The total number of propagators (internal lines) is $I_B + I_F$, where $I_B$ is the number of internal photon lines and $I_F$ is the number of internal fermion lines.
4. The total number of vertices $V$ contributes $V$ powers of $\kappa$, so the total power of $\kappa$ in a diagram is $V$, which means that the part of the amplitude proportional to $\kappa^V$ has a mass dimension of $[\kappa^V] = -V$ (since $[\kappa] = -1$).

However, a more standard way to find the superficial degree of divergence $D$ is:
$$
D = 4L - 2I_B - I_F.
$$
This is because a boson propagator (photon) has a momentum dependence of $1/k^2$ (which contributes a power of $-2$ for each internal boson line), while a fermion propagator has a momentum dependence of $1/k$ (which contributes a power of $-1$ for each internal fermion line).

However, another way to express $D$ is:
$$
D = 4 - d - \sum_i (d_i - 4) V_i,
$$
where $d$ is the total mass dimension of the external fields and $d_i$ is the mass dimension of the $i$-th interaction term. For our interaction term:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}.
$$
The mass dimension of the interaction term itself (excluding the coupling constant $\kappa$) is:
$$
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 5,
$$
so the mass dimension of the interaction term including $\kappa$ is:
$$
[\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 4,
$$
since $[\kappa] = -1$ and $[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 5$, so $5 - 1 = 4$. 

However, what matters here is the "canonical dimension" of the interaction term itself (excluding the coupling constant). The "canonical dimension" of the interaction term is $5$, which means that the "operator" $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $5$. 

However, a term in the Lagrangian should have a total mass dimension of $4$, so the part excluding the coupling constant should have a mass dimension of $5$, which makes the coupling constant have a negative mass dimension (as we found that $[\kappa] = -1$). 

A theory is usually considered renormalizable if all the coupling constants have a mass dimension that is zero or positive. A coupling constant with a negative mass dimension makes the theory non-renormalizable because higher-order diagrams will have higher powers of momentum in the numerator, which makes the divergences worse and requires an infinite number of counterterms.

Based on this reasoning, the theory described by the given interaction Lagrangian is likely non-renormalizable.

#### Conclusion:
1. The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$.
2. The theory is not renormalizable because the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension.
