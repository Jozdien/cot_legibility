# Original Question

Researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets: Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:

To solve for which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we need to recall the geometric transit probability formula for a planet on a circular orbit:

$$P_{\text{transit}} = \frac{R_{\text{star}} + R_{\text{planet}}}{a},$$

where $R_{\text{star}}$ is the radius of the star, $R_{\text{planet}}$ is the radius of the planet, $a$ is the semi-major axis of the orbit of the planet around the star. 

However, typically the radius of the planet is much smaller than the radius of the star ($R_{\text{planet}} \ll R_{\text{star}}$), so the formula is approximated as:

$$P_{\text{transit}} \approx \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}.
$$

We need to compare the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2.

Let us denote the parameters for Planet_1 (orbiting star 1) as follows:
- Distance from the star to Planet_1 (semi-major axis): $a_1$
- Mass of star 1 (host star of Planet_1): $M_{S1}$
- Radius of star 1 (host star of Planet_1): $R_{S1}$
- Orbital period of Planet_1: $P_1$
- Minimum mass of Planet_1: $M_{P1,\text{min}}$

Similarly, for Planet_2 (orbiting star 2):
- Distance from the star to Planet_2 (semi-major axis): $a_2$
- Mass of star 2 (host star of Planet_2): $M_{S2}$
- Radius of star 2 (host star of Planet_2): $R_{S2}$
- Orbital period of Planet_2: $P_2$
- Minimum mass of Planet_2: $M_{P2,\text{min}}$

### Given:
#### 1. Both Planet_1 and Planet_2 have "Earth-like" masses and are detected via the radial velocity (RV) method.
#### 2. Both planets have the same masses ("minimum masses"):
$$
M_{P1,\text{min}} = M_{P2,\text{min}}.
$$
However, the "minimum mass" is given by the RV formula $M_{P} \sin(i)$, where $i$ is the inclination angle of the planet's orbit with respect to the line of sight. The true mass $M_{P}$ should satisfy:
$$
M_{P1} \sin(i_1) = M_{P1,\text{min}}, \\
M_{P2} \sin(i_2) = M_{P2,\text{min}},
$$
but here we assume that $M_{P1,\text{min}} \approx M_{P2,\text{min}}$ means that the actual planet masses might be different if the inclinations $i_1$ and $i_2$ are different. However, in practice, if no additional information is given about inclinations, we can safely assume that the "minimum masses" are indicative of the fact that the real masses could be equal if both systems have statistically similar inclinations (since $\sin(i) \leq 1$, the true mass could be larger or equal to the minimum mass).
#### 3. The orbital period of Planet_1 ($P_1$) is three times shorter than that of Planet_2 ($P_2$):
$$
P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}.
$$

#### 4. Both planets have circular orbits.
#### 5. The mass of the host star for Planet_1 is twice that of the host star for Planet_2:
$$
M_{S1} = 2M_{S2}.
$$

#### 6. The host star for Planet_2 is "slightly evolved," which implies that it might have expanded a bit compared to a main-sequence star of similar mass.
#### 7. Both host stars have the same radii:
$$
R_{S1} = R_{S2} = R.
$$

We need to compare the transit probabilities $P_{\text{transit,1}}$ for Planet_1 and $P_{\text{transit,2}}$ for Planet_2. Recall again that:
$$
P_{\text{transit,1}} \approx \frac{R_{S1}}{a_1} = \frac{R}{a_1} \text{ , (since $R_{S1} = R$)} \\
P_{\text{transit,2}} \approx \frac{R_{S2}}{a_2} = \frac{R}{a_2} \text{ , (since $R_{S2} = R$)}.
$$
We need to compare $a_1$ and $a_2$.

To find $a_1$ and $a_2$, we need to use Kepler's third law which states that:
$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(M_{\text{star}} + M_{\text{planet}})} a^3.
$$
For a planet orbiting a star where $M_{\text{star}} \gg M_{\text{planet}}$ (since the star mass is typically much larger than a planet's mass), this can be approximated as:
$$
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM_{\text{star}}} a^3,
$$
so:
$$
a = \left(\frac{G M_{\text{star}} P^2}{4\pi^2}\right)^{1/3}.
$$
This makes it clear that $a$ depends on $M_{\text{star}}$ and $P^2$.

For Planet_1:
$$
a_1 = \left(\frac{GM_{S1} P_1^2}{4\pi^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.
$$
Similarly for Planet_2:
$$
a_2 = \left(\frac{GM_{S2} P_2^2}{4\pi^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.
$$
Given $M_{S1} = 2M_{S2}$, let us substitute:
$$
a_1 = \left(\frac{G \cdot 2M_{S2} P_1^2}{4\pi^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} = \left(\frac{2GM_{S2} P_1^2}{4\pi^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.
$$
And for $a_2$:
$$
a_2 = \left(\frac{GM_{S2} P_2^2}{4\pi^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.
$$
To compare $a_1$ and $a_2$, let us compare the terms inside the parentheses:
$$
\text{(inside parentheses for $a_1$)} = \frac{2GM_{S2} P_1^2}{4\pi^2} \\
\text{(inside parentheses for $a_2$)} = \frac{GM_{S2} P_2^2}{4\pi^2} \\
$$
Therefore, the ratio of $a_1$ and $a_2$ can be derived as:
$$
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2GM_{S2} P_1^2}{4\pi^2} \times \frac{4\pi^2}{GM_{S2} P_2^2} = \frac{2 P_1^2}{P_2^2}.
$$
Given $P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}$:
$$
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = \frac{2\left(\frac{P_2^2}{9}\right)}{P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
$$
Alternatively:
$$
\left(\frac{a_1}{a_2}\right)^3 = \frac{2}{9}.
$$
$$
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx (0.222)^{1/3} \approx 0.6057,
$$
which means:
$$
a_1 \approx 0.6057a_2.
$$
This implies that $a_1 < a_2$.

To compare the transit probabilities $P_{\text{transit,1}}$ and $P_{\text{transit,2}}$:
$$
P_{\text{transit,1}} = \frac{R}{a_1} \text{ (where $R_{S1} = R$)} \\
P_{\text{transit,2}} = \frac{R}{a_2} \text{ (where $R_{S2} = R$)}.
$$
Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities becomes:
$$
\frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.6057} \approx 1.65094.
$$
In simpler terms:
```
P_{\text{transit,1}} \approx 1.65094 \times P_{\text{transit,2}}.
```
This tells us that the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than that for Planet_2.

Thus, researchers should choose to observe **Planet_1**.

### Double-checking our reasoning and verifying any assumptions:
We need to make a final check on why our reasoning makes sense. The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis $a$, so we need the planet that orbits closer to its star (i.e., the one with the smaller $a$). 

Because:
$$a_1 = \left(\frac{2GM_{S2} P_1^2}{4\pi^2}\right)^{1/3} \text{ where $P_1^2 = P_2^* P_1$ where $P_2^* = \frac{P_2}{3}$} \text{ and } M_{S1} = 2M_{S2},$$
but:
$$ a_1 = \left(\frac{2 \cdot G \cdot M_{S2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{4\pi^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot G \cdot M_{S2} \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9}}{4\pi^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9} \frac{GM_{S2} P_2^2}{4\pi^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} a_2.$$

This makes it clear that $a_1 < a_2$. Thus, the transit probability $P_{\text{transit}} = \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}$ should be higher for the planet with a smaller semi-major axis.

Therefore, the answer is:
**Planet_1 because its orbital semi-major axis is smaller.**
However, what we need to make sure is that the question statement makes sense. Another way to directly check the relevant part of Kepler's third law here is:
$$
a \propto (M_{\text{star}} \times P^2)^{1/3}.
$$
So:
$$
a \propto (M_{\text{star}})^{1/3} \times P^{2/3}.
$$
Given $P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2$ and $M_{S1} = 2M_{S2}$:
$$
a_1 \propto (2)^{1/3} \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{2/3} \times (M_{S2})^{1/3} \times (P_2)^{2/3} \\
a_1 \propto (2)^{1/3} \times \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^{1/3} \times (M_{S2})^{1/3} \times (P_2)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}a_2.
$$
This confirms that $a_1$ is indeed smaller than $a_2$, thus $P_{\text{transit,1}} > P_{\text{transit,2}}$.

Answer should be verified once more such that:
$$
a_{1} < a_{2} \Rightarrow P_{\text{transit,1}} > P_{\text{transit,2}}.
$$
Hence, the researchers should choose to observe **Planet_1**.
