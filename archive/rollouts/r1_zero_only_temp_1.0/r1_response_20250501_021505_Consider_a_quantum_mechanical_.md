# Original Question

Consider a quantum mechanical system containing a particle of mass $m$ moving in an istropic three dimensional potential of the form $V(r) = 1/2 m \omega^2 r^2$ corresponding to the acted force obeying Hookeâ€™s law. Here, $\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the origin in spherical polar coordinate. What is the value of energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue?

To solve for the energy of the third excited state for a particle of mass $m$ moving in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic potential of the form $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the origin in spherical coordinates, we need to identify the potential as a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential where $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.

The potential $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$ is a spherically symmetric three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, which means:
$$
V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2).
$$
This can be decomposed into separate harmonic oscillators for each Cartesian coordinate:
$$
V(x, y, z) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 y^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 z^2.
$$
The Hamiltonian for such a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic harmonic oscillator thus reads:
$$
\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}_x^2}{2m} + \frac{\hat{p}_y^2}{2m} + \frac{\hat{p}_z^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \hat{x}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \hat{y}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \hat{z}^2,
$$
which splits into three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators along $x$, $y$, and $z$:
$$
\hat{H} = \left(\frac{\hat{p}_x^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \hat{x}^2\right) + \left(\frac{\hat{p}_y^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \hat{y}^2\right) + \left(\frac{\hat{p}_z^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \hat{z}^2\right).
$$
$$
\hat{H} = \hat{H}_x + \hat{H}_y + \hat{H}_z,
$$
where:
$$
\hat{H}_x = \frac{\hat{p}_x^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \hat{x}^2,
$$
$$
\hat{H}_y = \frac{\hat{p}_y^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \hat{y}^2,
$$
$$
\hat{H}_z = \frac{\hat{p}_z^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 \hat{z}^2.
$$

The energy eigenvalues for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\alpha}$ (where $\alpha = x, y,$ or $z$) are given by:
$$
E_{n_{\alpha}} = \left(n_{\alpha} + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar\omega \quad \text{where } n_{\alpha} = 0, 1, 2, \ldots,
$$
where $n_{\alpha}$ is the quantum number for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator along the $\alpha$ coordinate.

For the three-dimensional case, the total energy eigenvalue is thus:
$$
E = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega + \left(n_z + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega,
$$
which simplifies to:
$$
E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega.
$$
Defining $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ where $n_x, n_y, n_z = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$, one can write the total energy as:
$$
E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega,
$$
where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The "ground state" here corresponds to $n=0$, which means $n_x = n_y = n_z = 0$.

To find the "third excited state", we need to identify what we mean by "excited states". The ground state energy for the system is obtained when $n = 0$ (where $n_x = n_y = n_z = 0$):
$$
E_{\text{ground}} = \left(0 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar\omega = \frac{3}{2} \hbar\omega,
$$
which corresponds to the first state (ground state).

The first excited state corresponds to $n = 1$ (which could be any combination where $n_x + n_y + n_z = 1$):
$$
E_{\text{first excited}} = \left(1 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar\omega = \frac{5}{2} \hbar\omega.
$$
The second excited state corresponds to $n = 2$ (such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 2$):
$$
E_{\text{second excited}} = \left(2 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar\omega = \frac{7}{2} \hbar\omega.
$$
The third excited state corresponds distinctly to $n = 3$ (since excited states are characterized by $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ where $n$ sequences the total quantum number sums):
$$
E_{\text{third excited}} = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar\omega.
$$
Thus, the value of energy for the third excited state is:
$$
\boxed{\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega}.
$$

To find how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to the third excited state with $n = 3$, we need to find how many $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ triples satisfy $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$, where $n_x,\, n_y,$ and $n_z$ are non-negative integers. 

For $n=3$, the task is to find all possible values of $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ such that:
$$
n_x + n_y + n_z = 3,
\qquad n_x, n_y, n_z \geq 0.
$$
The solutions are:
$$
(3, 0, 0),\, (0, 3, 0),\, (0, 0, 3),\,
(2, 1, 0),\, (2, 0, 1),\, (1, 2, 0),\,
(1, 0, 2),\, (0, 2, 1),\, (0, 1, 2),\,
(1, 1, 1).
$$
This makes a total of $10$ such triples. We need to verify this by counting systematically:

The question reduces to finding combinations such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. For a given $n$, the total number of such triples is given by the binomial coefficient $\binom{n+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{n+2}{2}$ because it is a well-known result that the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = n$ is:
$$
\binom{n_x + n_y + n_z + 2}{2} = \binom{n+2}{2}.
$$
For $n=3$:
$$
\binom{3+2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = \binom{5}{3} = \binom{5!}{3!2!} = \binom{5 \times 4}{2} = 10.
$$

Alternatively, one can verify by explicitly listing out the valid triples such that $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$:
1. $(3, 0, 0)$, $(0, 3, 0)$, $ (0, 0, 3)$: 3 triples where one index is $3$ and the others are $0$.
2. $(2, 1, 0)$, $(2, 0, 1)$, $(1, 2, 0)$, $(0, 2, 1)$, $(1, 0, 2)$, $(0, 1, 2)$: 6 triples where one index is $2$, another is $1$, and the remaining one is $0$.
3. $(1, 1, 1)$: 1 triple where all indices are $1$.

So explicitly, the triples are:
$$
(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3), (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (1,0,2), (0,1,2), (0,2,1), (1,1,1).
$$

Thus, there are $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state with total energy $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$.

We need to verify the energy associated with the state characterized by $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ triplet is indeed $(n + \frac{3}{2})\hbar \omega$ where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. Hence, the total energy for all the above triples where $n=3$ is:
$$
E_{\text{third excited}} = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
$$

So in summary:

1. The third excited state has an energy of $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$.
2. The total number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state is:
$$\boxed{10}.

This reasoning follows from the well-known results for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator.
