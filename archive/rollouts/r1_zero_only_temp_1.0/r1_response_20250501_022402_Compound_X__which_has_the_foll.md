To solve for the compound X based on the given IR and 1H NMR data, let us analyze the given information step by step.

#### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm-1**: This broad peak is typically indicative of an O-H stretch, which could be from a carboxylic acid group (which usually shows a broad peak in the range of 3400–2500 cm-1 due to hydrogen bonding).
- **1720 cm-1**: This is a strong peak that is typically indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O stretch), which could be from a carboxylic acid (which usually shows a C=O stretch around 1700-1725 cm-1).
- **1610 cm-1**: This peak could be indicative of a C=C stretch in an aromatic ring (usually around 1600 cm-1).
- **1450 cm-1**: This peak could be due to C-H bending vibrations in an alkyl group or part of the aromatic ring vibrations.

#### 1H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet at a high chemical shift is typically indicative of a carboxylic acid proton (COOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: A doublet at 8.0 ppm suggests aromatic protons that are likely deshielded by an electron-withdrawing group such as a carboxylic acid group. The "d" indicates a doublet, which means that there is one neighboring proton coupling with these two protons.
- **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Another doublet at 7.2 ppm also suggests aromatic protons. The "d" here indicates that there is one neighboring proton coupling with these two protons as well.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet at 2.9 ppm could be a methine proton (CH) that is adjacent to a group that deshields it, such as a CH next to a benzene ring or another electron-withdrawing group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet at 1.7 ppm could be a methylene group (CH2) that is part of an alkyl chain.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet at 1.4 ppm is typically indicative of a methyl group (CH3) that is next to a methine group (CH).
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet at 0.9 ppm is typically indicative of a terminal methyl group (CH3) that is next to a methylene group (CH2).

Based on the IR data, it seems that compound X contains a carboxylic acid group (broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 and a peak at 1720 cm-1) and an aromatic ring (peak at 1610 cm-1). 

The 1H NMR data shows a total of 11 protons explicitly mentioned (excluding the broad singlet at 10.5 ppm which is likely a carboxylic acid proton). The aromatic region shows two doublets at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H), which suggests a para-disubstituted benzene ring where the two sets of doublets indicate a symmetrical structure where two protons are on one part of the ring and two on the other part. The chemical shifts suggest that one substituent is electron-withdrawing (which makes the nearby aromatic protons appear at a higher chemical shift, such as 8.0 ppm), while the other substituent might be electron-donating or less electron-withdrawing (which makes the nearby aromatic protons appear at a lower chemical shift, such as 7.2 ppm).

The aliphatic part of the NMR data shows:
- A methine proton (2.9 ppm, m, 1H) which is part of a more complex environment (multiplet indicates multiple neighboring protons).
- A methylene group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H) which is part of a chain where the protons are in a complex environment.
- A methyl group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H) which is a doublet, indicating that it is next to a methine proton (CH-CH3).
- Another methyl group (0.9 ppm, t, 3H) which is a triplet, indicating that it is next to a methylene group (CH2-CH3).

Based on the 1H NMR data, the aliphatic part seems to be a chain such as CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-. The methine proton (2.9 ppm, m, 1H) is likely part of a CH(CH3) group where the "m" (multiplet) indicates that it is coupled to multiple protons such as a CH2 group and a CH3 group. 

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) indicates a CH3 group next to a CH group (CH-CH3), so the part of the structure could be CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-. 

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) indicates a CH3 group next to a CH2 group (CH2-CH3), so the part of the structure could be CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)- where the CH3-CH2 part makes the triplet at 0.9 ppm (CH3-CH2-CH(CH3)-).

The question states that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI (a reducing agent) typically results in the reduction of the carboxylic acid group to an alkyl group. The reaction is known as the "Clemmensen reduction" when using zinc amalgam and HCl, but a similar reduction can be achieved with red phosphorus and HI where the reaction proceeds as follows:
$$
\text{R-COOH} \xrightarrow{\text{red P, HI}} \text{R-CH3}
$$
However, a more common reaction for a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI is:
$$
\text{R-COOH} \xrightarrow{\text{red P, HI}} \text{R-CH3}
$$
