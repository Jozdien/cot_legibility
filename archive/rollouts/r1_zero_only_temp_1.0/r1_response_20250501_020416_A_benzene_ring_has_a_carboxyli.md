To solve for the IUPAC name of the given compound, let us first interpret what the question states:

The question mentions a benzene ring that has a carboxylic acid group, a carbaldehyde group (which refers to an aldehyde group attached to the benzyl carbon, i.e., a "-CHO" group), and a cyano group (which is a "-CN" group). These three groups are "meta to one another." 

We need to place the carboxylic acid ($-COOH$), carbaldehyde ($-CHO$), and cyano group ($-CN$) such that they are all "meta" to one another on a benzene ring. 

The question provides additional substituents:
1) "Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group ($-OH$) and a dimethyl amino group (typically denoted as $-(CH_3)_2N$, which could be written as $N(CH_3)_2$ or $N(CH_3)_2$, where $-$ stands for a bond linking the nitrogen to the aromatic ring).
2) "Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group" ($-OCH_3$).
    
Another part of the question states that "the methoxy and the alcohol groups are also both ortho to the nitrile group."

Based on the question, here are the specific substituents mentioned explicitly:
- carboxylic acid ($-COOH$)
- carbaldehyde ($-CHO$)
- cyano group ($-CN$)
- hydroxyl group ($-OH$)
- dimethyl amino group ($-N(CH_3)_2$)
- methoxy group $-OCH_3$

The question states that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano group are "meta" to one another. Therefore, one possible valid relative placement on a six-membered benzene ring where three groups are meta to one another might be such that they are on positions 1, 3, and 5 (with positions numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on a benzene ring where position 1 is meta to positions 3 and 5, which are also meta to each other).

However, another part of the question mentions that:
1) "Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group." This means that the hydroxyl group and the dimethyl amino group should be next to the carbon where the carboxylic acid is attached (i.e., one should be at "position 2" if the carboxylic acid is at "position 1," and the other should be at "position 6" if the carboxylic acid is still at "position 1").
2) "Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group." This means the methoxy group should be opposite (i.e., on carbon number 4 if the carboxylic acid group is on carbon number 1).
    
To make a structured reasoning, let us assume the carboxylic acid is at position `1` on a benzene ring. Thus, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups must be placed at positions `3` and `5` (since they are meta to one another and thus should be three carbons apart from one another on the benzene ring, either positions 1, 3, and 5 where the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, the carbaldehyde could be on carbon 3 and the cyano group could be on carbon 5 or vice versa). 

Based on our assumed position for the carboxylic acid at carbon `1`:
1. The hydroxyl ($-OH$) and dimethyl amino group ($-N(CH_3)_2$) should be ortho to the carboxylic acid (i.e., at positions `2` and `6`).

Thus, so far, the benzene ring looks like this:
Carbon `1` has the $COOH$ group.
Carbons `2` and `6` need to accommodate $OH$ and $N(CH_3)_2$ (we need to decide which one is on carbon `2` and which on carbon `6`).
Carbon `4` should have the methoxy group ($-OCH_3$).

The remaining carbon numbers are `3` and `5`, so these should hold the carbaldehyde and the cyano group. However, we need another part of the question which states:
"The methoxy ($-OCH_3$) and the alcohol ($-OH$) are both ortho to the nitrile ($-CN$)." 

This means that the $CN$ should be positioned such that it is next to both $-OCH_3$ and $-OH$. To make reasoning explicit here follows another part of the question that makes us need to check where the nitrile group should be positioned such that the $CN$ group is ortho to both $OH$ and $OCH_3$.

The only position where $CN$ could be "ortho" both to the $OCH_3$ group and the $OH$ group is such that the $CN$ group needs to be positioned between where $OCH_3$ and $OH$ are placed such that one of them is on one "side" (i.e., one carbon to the right or left) of the $CN$ group while the other should be on the other "side" of the $CN$ group. 

Looking at what we currently have assigned:
- $COOH$ at carbon `1`.
- $OCH_3$ at carbon `4`.
Thus, $OH$ must be at either carbon `2` or `6` while $N(CH_3)_2$ would be on the remaining one of carbons `2` or `6`.

Carbon `4` has the $OCH_3$ group. Thus, $CN$ should be "ortho" to $OCH_3$, meaning that $CN$ needs to be on carbon `3` or `5`. 

However, since "methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile," $OH$ should be placed such that it is ortho to $CN$. So, if $CN$ is on carbon `3`, the neighboring carbons are `2` and `4`. Carbon `4` already has $OCH_3$, so carbon `2` needs to be where the $OH$ should be positioned. 

If $CN$ is on carbon `3`, `OCH3` is on carbon `4` (which makes sense as "methoxy is ortho to the nitrile"), while $OH$ should be on carbon `2` (which makes sense as "alcohol is also orttho to the nitrile"). 

Conversely, the alternative could be that $CN$ is on carbon `5`. However, this makes less sense since if $CN$ is placed on carbons `5`, its ortho positions should be carbons `4` and `6`. Therefore, carbon `4` already has $OCH_3$, so $OH$ should be placed on carbon `6`. However, $OH$ should also be placed ortho to the carboxylic acid group which is on carbon `1`, so carbon `6` should indeed still make sense for the $OH$.

However, another assertion here states that the methoxy group should be opposite (para) to the carboxylic acid group. Thus, what we need now is to make a clear structure based on what seems most logical here. 

So far, we need:
- $CHO$ should be placed on carbon `5` because only carbon `3` or `5` could house either $CN$ or $CHO$, and carbon `3` was already filled with $CN$.
- $N(CH_3)_2$ should be on carbon `6` because $COOH$ is on carbon `1$, while hydroxyl is on carbon `2`.

Recall what our setup looks like so far:
1. Carboxyl group on carbon `1`.
2. Hydroxyl group on carbon `2`.
3. Cyano group on carbon `3`.
4. Methoxy group on carbon `4`.
5. Carbaldehyde group on carbon `5`.
6. $N$-dimethyl amino group on carbon `6`.

Let's verify once again what the question demands:
1. "Carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano groups are all meta to one another."
    - $COOH$ (on carbon `1`) is meta to $CN$ (on carbon `3`) and $CHO$ (on carbon `5`); $CN$ is also meta to $CHO$. Satisfied.
2. "Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group and a $N,N$-dimethyl amino group":
    - $COOH$ (on carbon `1`) is ortho to $OH$ (on carbon `2`) and $(CH_3)2N$ group (on carbon `6`).
3. "Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group":
    - $COOH$ (on carbon `1`) is para to $OCH3$ (carbon `4`).
4. "The methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile group":
    - $OCH_3$ (on carbon `4$) is indeed ortho to $CN$ (on carbon `3`).
    - $OH$ (on carbon `2`) is also orthogonal to $CN$ (on carbon `3`).

Correct structure seems thus:

```
              (6)N(CH3)2
                    \\
                     C6 - C1(COOH) - C2(OH)
                       \\           ||
       (5)CHO - C5 - C4(OCH3) - C3(CN)
                   /          \
               C5             C3
```

Another way to visualize the structure is by numbering the carbons explicitly such that:
1. Carboxylic acid at position 1.
2. Hydroxyl at position 2.
3. Cyano at position 3.
4. Methoxy at position 4.
5. Carbaldehyde at position 5.
6. $N,N$-dimethyl amino group at position 6.

For IUPAC naming, the priority order of functional groups should be followed where the highest priority functional group should be taken as the main group and given the lowest locant number (usually the priority decreases in the order: carboxylic acid > aldehyde > nitrile > hydroxyl > amine > methoxy, typically).

The priority order might be as follows:
1. Carboxylic acid (suffix: -oic acid)
2. Aldehyde (if primary suffix it is given as "carbaldehyde" suffix used if no carboxyl group is present such as "benzaldehyde").
3. Nitrile (suffix: -nitrile, prefix: cyano-)
4. Hydroxyl (suffix: -ol if lower priority group).
5. Amino group (suffix: -amine if lower priority group).
6. Methoxy (prefix: methoxy-, lowest priority).

Based on naming priorities, the principal functional group here appears to be the carboxylic acid. Thus, the main chain base name should be "benzoic acid." 

The next step is numbering such that the carboxylic acid gets the lowest possible locant (which here is already assumed as carbon `1`). Thus, the only other valid way would be counting in the opposite direction so that the carbaldehyde could be on carbon 1 (but we need to check if that makes the locants smaller for the alphabetically ordered substituents).

Since the question makes us place $COOH$ at carbon `1`, another round of labels might be:
$$
1-COOH, \quad 2-OH, \quad 3-CN, \quad 4-OCH_3, \quad 5-CHO, \quad 6-N(CH_3)_2.
$$
However, we need another round of valid numbering such that all the groups having the lowest possible set of locants.

We need to check if any rotation makes the sum of locants smaller:
1. The current structure places $-COOH, -OH, -CN, -OCH_3, -CHO,$ and $-N(CH_3)_2$ groups on carbons numbered such that the $COOH$ is on carbon $1$ such that the full list of locants is $1 (COOH), 2 (OH), 3 (CN), 4 (OCH_3), 5 (CHO),$ and $6 (N(CH_3)_2)$.
    
2. After a 180-degree rotation (thus switching the "direction" of counting such that what previously corresponded to positions like $6, 5, 4, 3, 2,$ and $1$ now becomes $1, 2, 3, 4, 5,$ and $6$, but the order of substituents would be reversed such that:
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
6 \text{ becomes position } 1: & -N(CH_3)_2 \\
5 \text{ becomes position } 2: & -CHO \\
4 \text{ becomes position } 3: & -OCH_3 \\
3 \text{ becomes position } 4: & -CN \\
2 \text{ becomes position } 5: & -OH \\
1 \text{ becomes position } 6: & -COOH \\
\end{array}
$$
But here, giving the $COOH$ the highest priority makes it on carbon `6`, which is not ideal. 

To make sure the $COOH$ is given the carbon `1` locant, the current numbering seems optimal thus far. 

To prioritize alphabetically when listing substituents:
1. The main part is "benzoic acid" due to the $COOH$ group situated on the benzene ring where:
$$
3-(cyanomethyl)-4-formyl-5-hydroxy-2-methoxy-N,N-dimethylbenzoic acid
$$
This seems a bit non-systematic. Another valid part is:
Numbering ring so that $COOH$ is at position `1`:
$$
3-\text{Cyano}-4-\text{formyl}-N,N-\text{dimethyl}-5-\text{hydroxy}-2-\text{methoxy benzene}-1-\text{carboxylic acid}
$$
Another round requires us to properly order the substituents based on alphabetical precedence while using the proper prefixes and ensuring that the principal group gets the lowest possible locant.

The substituents are listed as follows alphabetically:
1. Cyano group (use "cyano" prefix, correct locant is 3 from $COOH$ on position 1).
2. Formyl should be named systematically either as "formyl" prefix or correctly as "aldehyde" which should be "formyl" here ("formyl-" prefix has locant 5).
3. $N,N$-Dimethyl amino group (prefix "N,N-dimethylamino" has locant 6).
4. Hydroxy group ("hydroxy" has locant 2).
5. Methoxy group ("methoxy" has locant 4).

Thus, the name should be structured such that the substituents appear in alphabetical order ("cyano" comes first alphabetically among the prefix names like "dimethylamino,"ethoxy," "formyl," "hydroxy," and "methoxy"):

So, the IUPAC name should be ordered alphabetically among the substituents excluding the "benzoic acid" part which serves as the main part of the compound named as the root part of the name:
1. Cyano (3-position)
2. (Formyl is also known as carbaldehyde, here "formyl" should be used as a substituent thus called "5-formyl").
3. $(N,N)$-dimethylamino (6-position).
4. Hydroxy (2-position).
5. Methoxy (4-position).
6. Benzoic acid (from carbon `1`).

Based on alphabetical order among the substituents ("dimethylamino" should be put as "N,N-dimethylamino," thus ordered by "d"):
1. 3-cyano-
2. 5-formyl-
3. 6-(dimethylamino)-
4. 2-hydroxy-
5. 4-methoxy-

Thus, the name should be:
$$3\text{-cyano-5-formyl-6-(N,N-dimethylamino)-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid}$$

However, the question mentioned "carbaldehyde" which should be used if there is no higher priority functional group such as a carboxylic acid. However, "formyl" should suffice here when used as a prefix. Notice that the "aldehyde" part might need to be "formyl" when used as a prefix if "carbaldehyde" is used only if no other higher priority suffix is used thus here the carboxyl group makes the suffix "-oic acid."

However, let us verify our reasoning explicitly:
1) "*6-dimethylamino*" should correctly be "*6-(N,N-dimethylamino)*" which makes sense because "N" is part of the group name which should be captured explicitly in brackets for such groups where substituents are on nitrogen.
Hence, the name should be:
$$3-\text{cyano}-5-\text{formyl}-6-(N,N-\text{dimethylamino})-2-\text{hydroxy}-4-\text{methoxybenzoic acid}$$
However, "benzoic acid" should be listed last after the substituents are ordered alphabetically except for the hydroxy and methoxy groups ("hydroxy" appears before "methoxy" alphabetically so we need these in order).

However, another round of checking the naming order should be made:
1. Carboxylic acid takes priority and is thus the suffix "benzoic acid."
2. Other substituents must be listed alphabetically:
    - "cyano" (c comes first)
    - "formyl" (f comes after c).
    - "hydroxy" (h appears after f).
    - "methoxy" (m appears after h).
    - "dimethylamino" (d should actually appear first among those prefixes listed, so it appears before "cyano."

Correcting the alphabetical order for the substituents:
$$
2-\text{hydroxy}-4-\text{methoxy}-3-\text{forminoyl}-5-\text{cyano}-6-(N,N-\text{dimethylamino})-\text{benzoic acid}
$$
The alphabetic order goes as following for the substituent prefixes:
1. cyano-
2. dimethylamino- (Note that this should be formatted as "(N,N-dimethyl)amino" which makes "d" the first character for alphabetizing)
3. formyl (Note that "formyl-" needs to be used here because "carbaldehyde" usually follows if it is the main functional group)
4. hydroxy-
5. methoxy-

So, alphabetizing these:
1. "3-Cyano" ("Cyano" starts with "C").
2. "6-(N,N-Dimethylamino)" ("Dimethylamino" starts with "D").
3. "5-Formyl" ("Formyl" starts with "F").
4. "2-Hydroxy" ("Hydroxy" starts with "H").
5. "4-Methoxy" ("Methoxy" starts with "M").

So, the compound should be named thus as:
$$
3-\text{cyano}-6-(N,N-\text{dimethylamino})-5-\text{formyl}-2-\text{hydroxy}-4-\text{methoxybenzoic acid}
$$

However, there seems to be a need for validating the structure actually makes sense using a chem drawing software might verify such a complex structure is accurate. Nevertheless, the initial reasoning makes it sound logical.

Thus we need to make a double check for the order of substituents
