To solve for the mean decay distance of a meson resonance $X$ with a given production energy $E_{X} = 8 \text{ GeV}$, mass $m_{X} = 1.2 \text{ GeV}$, and width $\Gamma_{X} = 320 \text{ MeV} = 0.32 \text{ GeV}$, we need to find the mean lifetime $\tau_{X}$ of the meson $X$ and then use the relativistic formula for the mean decay distance $d$ given by $d = \beta \gamma c \tau_{X}$ where $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$ (where $v$ is the velocity of the meson $X$), $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}$, and $c$ is the speed of light.

However, the mean lifetime $\tau_{X}$ is related to the width $\Gamma_{X}$ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:
$$
\tau_{X} = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_{X}}.
$$
Here, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant which is approximately equal to $6.582 \times 10^{-25} \text{ GeV} \cdot \text{s}$.

So, first let us calculate the mean lifetime $\tau_{X}$:
$$
\tau_{X} = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_{X}} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \text{ GeV} \cdot \text{s}}{0.32 \text{ GeV}}.
$$
$$
\tau_{X} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \text{ s} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \text{ s}.
$$
(Note that $1 \text{ GeV} \cdot \text{s} \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \text{ GeV} \cdot \text{s}$ is a well-known constant.)

To find the mean decay distance $d$, we need to find the velocity $v$ of the meson $X$. However, what we need here is the product $\beta \gamma$, which is defined as:
$$
\beta \gamma = \frac{\beta}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}.
$$
However, a more useful form for us here is:
$$
\beta \gamma = \frac{p}{m},
$$
where $p$ is the momentum of the meson $X$ and $m$ is its rest mass $m_{X}$.

The total energy $E_{X}$ of the meson $X$ is given as $8 \text{ GeV}$, and its rest mass $m_{X}$ is given as $1.2 \text{ GeV}$. The total energy $E_{X}$ is given by:
$$
E_{X} = \gamma m_{X} c^2,
$$
where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor defined as:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}.
$$
However, a more common form for the total energy is:
$$
E_{X}^2 = p^2 c^2 + m_{X}^2 c^4,
$$
where $p$ is the momentum of the meson $X$. Since we need the momentum $p$, we solve for $p$:
$$
p = \frac{1}{c} \sqrt{E_{X}^2 - m_{X}^2 c^4}.
$$
However, in natural units where $c=1$, the equation simplifies to:
$$
p = \sqrt{E_{X}^2 - m_{X}^2}.
$$
Plugging in the given values $E_{X} = 8 \text{ GeV}$ and $m_{X} = 1.2 \text{ GeV}$:
$$
p = \sqrt{(8 \text{ GeV})^2 - (1.2 \text{ GeV})^2} = \sqrt{64 \text{ GeV}^2 - 1.44 \text{ GeV}^2} = \sqrt{62.56 \text{ GeV}^2} \approx 7.91 \text{ GeV}.
$$
(Note that here $p$ is in units of $\text{GeV}/c$, but in natural units where $c=1$, $p$ is simply in units of $\text{GeV}$.)

To find the velocity $v$, we need to solve for $\beta$ explicitly. Another way to find $\beta$ is:
$$
\beta = \frac{pc}{E_{X}}.
$$
Again, in natural units where $c=1$:
$$
\beta = \frac{p}{E_{X}} = \frac{7.91 \text{ GeV}}{8 \text{ GeV}} \approx 0.98875.
$$
However, what we need for the mean decay distance is:
$$
d = \beta \gamma c \tau_{X}.
$$
We already know that:
$$
\beta \gamma = \frac{p}{m_{X}}.
$$
So, substituting $p$ and $m_{X}$:
$$
\beta \gamma = \frac{7.91 \text{ GeV}}{1.2 \text{ GeV}} \approx 6.5917.
$$
However, another way to verify this is by directly calculating $\gamma$:
$$
\gamma = \frac{E_{X}}{m_{X}} = \frac{8 \text{ GeV}}{1.2 \text{ GeV}} \approx 6.6667.
$$
And:
$$
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{6.6667}\right)^2} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
$$
So:
$$
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5913.
$$
(which is close to the previous result of $6.5917$, the slight discrepancy is due to round-off errors.)

However, what we need is the mean decay distance $d$:
$$
d = \beta \gamma c \tau_{X}.
$$
We need to make sure that the units are consistent. The speed of light $c$ is approximately $3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$:
$$
d = (6.5917) \times (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \text{ s}).
$$
$$
d \approx 6.5917 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \text{ meters}.
$$
$$
d \approx 4.0667 \times 10^{-15} \text{ meters}.
$$
However, a more common unit for such small distances is the femtometer (fm), where $1 \text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \text{ meters}$:
$$
d \approx 4.0667 \text{ fm}.
$$
This seems a bit small for a meson decay distance. Another common unit for particle physics is the "fermi" (which is the same as a femtometer), so it makes sense to verify the calculations again.

However, a more common way to directly solve for the decay length $L$ is:
$$
L = \gamma \beta c \tau,
$$
where $\tau$ is the proper lifetime (i.e., the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle). Another way to express the decay length is:
$$
L = \gamma \beta c \tau = \gamma \beta c \cdot \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma_{X}}.
$$
However, a more common form used in particle physics is:
$$
L = \frac{\hbar c}{\Gamma_{X}} \cdot \beta \gamma.
$$
The term $\hbar c$ is a well-known constant in natural units where $\hbar c \approx 197.3 \text{ MeV} \cdot \text{fm}$ (since $\hbar c \approx 197.3 \text{ MeV} \cdot \text{fm}$ is a well-known constant in particle physics, where $1 \text{ GeV} = 1000 \text{ MeV}$):
$$
\hbar c \approx 197.3 \times 10^{-3} \text{ GeV} \cdot \text{fm} = 0.1973 \text{ GeV} \cdot \text{fm}.
$$
So, the decay length $L$ can be written as:
$$
L = \frac{0.1973 \text{ GeV} \cdot \text{fm}}{\Gamma_{X}} \cdot \beta \gamma.
$$
We already found that $\beta \gamma \approx 6.5917$ and $\Gamma_{X} = 0.32 \text{ GeV}$:
$$
L = \frac{0.1973 \text{ GeV} \cdot \text{fm}}{0.32 \text{ GeV}} \times 6.5917.
$$
$$
L = \frac{0.1973 \times 6.5917}{0.32} \text{ fm}.
$$
$$
L \approx \frac{1.3005}{0.32} \text{ fm} \approx 4.0641 \text{ fm}.
$$
This is consistent with the previous result.

However, a more "intuitive" way to check the result is by using the "proper lifetime" $\tau_{X}$ and the "lab frame" lifetime $\gamma \tau_{X}$ (which is the "dilated" lifetime in the lab frame where the particle is moving at a high velocity). The "mean decay distance" is thus:
$$
d = v \times (\gamma \tau_{X}).
$$
However, what we need here is:
$$
d = v \gamma \tau_{X} = \beta c \gamma \tau_{X} = \beta \gamma c \tau_{X}.
$$
This is the same as what we used previously. 

However, a more "practical" way to make sure everything makes sense is to check the units explicitly:
$$
d = \beta \gamma c \tau_{X} \text{ (where $c$ is in m/s and $\tau_{X}$ is in seconds, so $d$ is in meters)}.
$$
$$
d = 6.5917 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \text{ meters}.
$$
$$
d \approx 4.0667 \times 10^{-15} \text{ meters} \approx 4.0667 \text{ fm}.
$$

Thus, the mean decay distance for the meson resonance $X$ is approximately $4.07 \text{ fm}$.

This reasoning makes sense because:
1. The meson has a very short lifetime (on the order of $10^{-24} \text{ s}$).
2. Even though it is traveling at a velocity close to the speed of light (since $\beta \approx 0.9887$), the short lifetime means that it does not travel very far before decaying.

Thus, the answer should be verified and seems reasonable. 

However, a more "practical" check might be to make sure that the velocity makes sense. Since $E_{X} = 8 \text{ GeV}$ and $m_{X} = 1.2 \text{ GeV}$, the meson is highly relativistic (since $E_{X} \gg m_{X}$), so a velocity close to $c$ makes sense. 

Thus, the mean decay distance is thus:
$$
\boxed{4.07 \text{ fm}}.
$$
(rounding to a few significant digits, the answer is approximately $4.07 \text{ fm}$ or $4.07 \times 10^{-15} \text{ m}$).
