# Original Question

The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement is a chemical reaction involving the conversion of a pinacol molecule, containing two adjacent alcohol groups, into a pinacolone under acidic conditions. It proceeds through the protonation of one alcohol group, followed by a 1,2-hydride shift, leading to the formation of a ketone (pinacolone) and the rearrangement of the molecule's structure.
What are the starting materials and products of the following Pinacol Pinacolone rearrangement reactions?
A + H2SO4 ---> 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one
methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 ---> B

To solve for the given Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement reactions, we need to recall the general mechanism of the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement. 

The Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement typically involves a vicinal diol (also known as a pinacol) which, under acidic conditions, undergoes a rearrangement to form a ketone (known as a pinacolone). The reaction proceeds through the following steps:
1. Protonation of one of the hydroxyl groups in the vicinal diol (pinacol) to make it a better leaving group (forming a water molecule).
2. Loss of water to form a carbocation on the carbon that was originally bonded to the protonated hydroxyl group.
3. A 1,2-migration (usually a methyl group or an aryl group) to stabilize the carbocation, which leads to a new carbocation where the migrating group has moved to the carbon that originally had the carbocation.
4. Deprotonation of the new carbocation (which is usually a protonated ketone) to form a ketone (pinacolone).

The question provides two reactions where the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement occurs. 

#### First reaction:
$$
A + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow 2,2\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexan-1-one}
$$
The product is given as $2,2\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexan-1-one}$. 

To identify the starting material $A$, we need to work backward from the product $2,2\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexan-1-one}$.

The structure of $2,2\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexan-1-one}$ can be interpreted as follows:
- "cyclohexan-1-one" indicates a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbon atoms is a ketone (carbonyl group) at position 1.
- "2,2-di-\(p\)-tolyl" indicates that there are two \(p\)-tolyl groups attached to the second carbon atom of the cyclohexanone ring.

The $p$-tolyl group is a $p$-methylphenyl group (i.e., a methyl group attached to the para position of a phenyl group, which is $CH_3C_6H_4-$, where the $CH_3$ is on the fourth carbon of the benzene ring relative to the point of attachment).

The structure of $2,2\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexan-1-one}$ thus looks like:
$$
\ce{
\chemfig{*6((-O=)-(-(=[::90]O)-[::-60](-[::60]?[a])(-[::-60]?[b]))-(-?[a])-(-?[b])---)}
}
$$
where "?[a]" and "?[b]" represent the $p$-tolyl groups. 

However, a more structured way to draw the product is:
$$
\ce{
\chemfig{*6((-O=)-(-(-[:90]C6H4CH3)(-[:270]C6H4CH3))---(-)-(-)-)}
}
$$
However, a more common way to represent $2,2\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexan-1-one}$ is:
$$
\ce{
\chemfig{*6((-O=)-(-(=[::90]O)-[::60](-[::60]C6H4CH3)(-[::-60]C6H4CH3))---)}
}
$$
However, a more "standard" way to draw the structure might be:
$$
\ce{
\chemfig{*6((-O=)-(-(=[::90]O)-[::60](-[::60]C6H4CH3)(-[::-60]C6H4CH3))---)}
}
$$
However, a more "standard" way to draw the structure might be:
$$
\ce{
\chemfig{*6((-O=)-(-(-[::60]C6H4CH3)(-[::-60]C6H4CH3))---)}
}
$$
where $C_6H_4CH_3$ represents the $p$-tolyl group (i.e., $CH_3C_6H_4$ where the $CH_3$ is on the para position relative to the point of attachment).

To find the starting material $A$, we need a pinacol (a vicinal diol) where the two hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbon atoms such that one of the carbons has two $p$-tolyl groups attached. 

However, the question states that the product is a cyclohexanone where the carbonyl group is at position 1 and there are two $p$-tolyl groups on carbon 2. Thus, the starting material should be a vicinal diol where the two hydroxyl groups are on carbons 1 and 2 of a cyclohexane ring where carbon 2 also has two $p$-tolyl groups attached. 

The most likely candidate for $A$ thus seems to be:
$$
1,2\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexane-1,2-diol}
$$
However, a more specific name might be $1,1\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexane-1,2-diol}$ where the two $p$-tolyl groups are on carbon 1 (which makes the carbocation formed on carbon 1 more stable due to the presence of two $p$-tolyl groups). However, a more symmetric and likely candidate might be $1,2\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexane-1,2-diol}$ where one $p$-tolyl group is on carbon 1 and another on carbon 2. However, a more symmetric and likely candidate might be $1,1\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexane-1,2-diol}$ where both $p$-tolyl groups are on carbon 1. 

However, a more logical candidate might be $1,1\text{-di-}p\text{-tolylcyclohexane-1,2-diol}$ where the two $p$-tolyl groups are on carbon 1. However, the question seems to be a bit ambiguous here.
