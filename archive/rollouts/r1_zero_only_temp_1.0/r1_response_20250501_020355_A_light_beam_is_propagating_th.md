# Original Question

A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory? Take the speed of light in vacuum c=1.

To solve for the speed of light in a moving glass with an index of refraction $n$, where the glass itself is moving at a velocity $v$ in the same direction as the light beam propagates through it and towards an observer in the laboratory, we need to first recall some important equations related to the velocity of light in a medium and the relativistic addition of velocities.

The index of refraction $n$ is defined as the ratio of the speed of light $c$ in vacuum to its speed $v_{\text{medium}}$ in the medium (in this case, the glass):
$$
n = \frac{c}{v_{\text{medium}}}.
$$
However, the question states that the speed of light in vacuum is taken to be $c = 1$, so the equation simplifies to:
$$
n = \frac{1}{v_{\text{medium}}}.
$$
This implies that the speed of light in the medium (glass) when it is stationary relative to an observer in the laboratory is:
$$
v_{\text{medium}} = \frac{1}{n}.
$$
However, what this refers to here is typically called the "phase velocity" ($v_{\text{phase}}$) of light in a medium such that:
$$
v_{\text{phase}} = \frac{c}{n}.
$$
However, we need another part of the problem here where the glass is moving towards the observer at a velocity $v$. Here, when they mention "what is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory," what matters here is what is referred to as the "signal velocity" (which usually refers to the group velocity of the light wave).

However, what seems most relevant here appears to be what is known as the "relative velocity" of light observed in the laboratory frame of reference where the glass itself is moving with velocity $v$ towards the observer. To solve for the velocity of light relative to the observer in the laboratory when the glass is also moving at a velocity $v$ "in the same direction as the beam," we need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:
$$
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + uv},
$$
where $u$ is the velocity of an object (in our case, the velocity of light in the rest frame of the glass), $v$ is the velocity of another frame (in our case, the velocity of translation of the glass relative to the laboratory frame), $u'$ is the velocity of the object as viewed from the laboratory frame.

We previously established that within the rest frame of stationary glass, the velocity of light within the glass is given by $u = \frac{c}{n}$. Given that $c = 1$, we need to find $u'$, which represents the observed velocity of the light beam through the glass from the viewpoint of an observer in the laboratory where the movable glass itself is moving at a velocity $v$ directed towards the observer such that both the light beam and the glass are moving toward the observer. 

However, since the beam travels within the glass whose rest frame velocity within the glass is $\frac{1}{n}$ (again, given $c=1$), we need to identify what is the velocity of the light beam within the glass itself first. Call the "velocity of light in the rest frame of the glass" as $u$, then:
$$
u = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{1}{n}.
$$
However, what we need here is the velocity of light in the lab frame where the glass itself is moving at a relative velocity $v$ "in the same direction" toward the observer where the beam propagates also in the same direction toward the observer. 

Thus, what we need here is the velocity addition formula for an object (light beam here) moving at velocity $u$ in a frame that itself moves relative to your frame (lab frame here) at another velocity $v$. However, here we need to remember that velocities should be treated relativistically because the question here implicitly suggests that the situation should be treated in the context of special relativity where velocities $u$ and $v$ can be significant portions of the speed of light $c$.

Hence, the correct formula should be:
$$
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}.
$$
However, usually we keep $c$ explicitly until the last step where we make $c=1$. So first, let $u$ represent the speed of light in the rest frame of the glass such that:
$$
u = \tfrac{c}{n} .
$$
Let us denote the velocity of the frame of the glass as $v$ (again, $c = 1$) such that both light propagation and the glass movement are towards the observer. 

The velocity $u'$ observed in the laboratory frame (outside the glass frame) should thus be computed like:
$$
u' = \frac{\tfrac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \left(\tfrac{c}{n}\right) \cdot \frac{v}{c^2}} = \frac{\tfrac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{nc}}.
$$
Since $c = 1$, we substitute $c$ by $1$ in these formulas:
$$
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v \cdot 1}{n}} = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}.
$$
To make this a bit clearer, write this as a single fraction for the numerator and a single fraction for the denominator:
$$
u' = \frac{\frac{1+vn}{n}}{1 + \frac{v}{n}} = \frac{\frac{1+vn}{n}}{\frac{n+v}{n}} = \frac{v \cdot n + 1}{n}\times \frac{n}{n + v} = \frac{vn + 1}{n + v}.
$$

Checking this formula again explicitly makes sure that the fraction makes sense. To verify what might be the limiting behavior, note that when $n = 1$ (which indicates no glass medium, just vacuum), this should lead back to the speed of light $c$ regardless of $v$. Substituting $n=1$ gives:
$$
u' = \frac{v \cdot 1 + 1}{1 + v} = \frac{v + 1}{v + 1} = 1,
$$
which makes sense because if there is no refractive medium (effectively $n=1$), the velocity should be $c$ (which equals $1$ here).

Another limiting validation could be when $v \to 0$ (glass is also stationary relative to the lab frame), the resultant velocity should be the normal speed of light in the stationary glass:
$$
u'|_{v=0} = \frac{0 \times n + 1}{n + 0} = \frac{1}{n} = \frac{c}{n}.
$$
Another check should be what happens if $v=0$ such that:
$$
u' = \frac{0 \cdot n + 1}{n + 0} = \frac{1}{n}.
$$
Thus, our answer seems to make logically sense for these limiting cases.

Based on well known derivations, the answer for the "speed of light in glass relative to the laboratory observer" for a glass moving towards him at velocity $v$ such that the light beam is propagating through the glass which itself is moving toward the laboratory observer should thus be:
$$
\boxed{\frac{vn+1}{n+v}} \, \text{ or equivalently } \, \frac{1 + n v}{n+v}.
}

$$
To make it a bit more general-formula-like, if one reverts $c$ explicitly (which would make $u=\frac{c}{n}$), rather than keeping $c=1$, the velocity observed relative to the lab frame might be:
$$
\frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{nc}}.
$$
We make a conversion for the final familiar check (if needed), it would be:
$$
\frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{vv}{nc}}.
$$
Such equations make sense within relativistic physics where $v$, $c$, $\frac{c}{n}$ might be comparable magnitudes. 

Hence if we wish to confirm more rigorously what's mathematically equal within your defined context where $c=1$, our reasoning process here seems pretty robust.

Therefore, once again, the answer should be:
$$\boxed{\frac{1 + nv}{n + v}}.$$

Considering unit check, $n$ is a dimensionless index of refraction while $v$ has the same unit as the speed of light $c$, thus the units check out correctly here such numerator and denominator both have the dimensions of velocity.

So this makes us sufficiently confident about our reasoning here.
