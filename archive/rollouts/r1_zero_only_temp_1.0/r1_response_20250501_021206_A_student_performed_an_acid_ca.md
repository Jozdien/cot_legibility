To solve for the reaction where 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with compound A under an acid catalyst (B) and heat to produce 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine, let us break down the components involved in the question.

The reactant mentioned is "3-methylpyrrolidine," which has the following structure:
$$
\text{Pyrrolidine structure is a five-membered ring consisting of four carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom (C}_4\text{H}_9\text{N)}.\\
\text{3-methylpyrrolidine has a methyl group at the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring:}\\
\mathrm{H_3C} - \overset{\text{(3-methylpyrrolidine)}}{\underset{3}{\text{N}} - \underset{2}{\text{CH_2}} - \underset{1}{\text{CH}} - \underset{\text{CH}_3}{\underset{3}{\text{CH}}} - \underset{4}{\text{CH_2}}}
$$
(This reflects the structure where the nitrogen is at position 1 and the methyl group is attached to the carbon at position 3. Another way to represent the basic pyrrolidine structure is below where the nitrogen is implicitly at position 1:)
$$
\underset{5}{\text{N}} - \underset{4}{\text{CH}_2} - \underset{3}{\text{CH}} - \underset{2}{\text{CH}_2} - \underset{1}{\text{CH}_2} \text{ such that introducing a methyl group on the third carbon makes it:}\\
\underset{5}{\text{N}} - \underset{4}{\text{CH}_2} - \underset{3}{\text{CH}(\text{CH}_3)} - \underset{2}{\text{CH}_2} - \underset{1}{\text{CH}_2} \\
$$

The product is "1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine." Breaking down this name:
$$
\text{"1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine"}:
$$
The parent chain here is again the "3-methylpyrrolidine" part where "1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)" describes a substituent attached to the nitrogen at the 1-position ("1-(...)") of the 3-methylpyrrolidine. The part "cyclohexylidenemethyl" can be interpreted as:
$$
\text{"cyclohexylidene"}\,\text{(this refers to a cyclohexylidene group, which is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon is converted into a double bond, i.e., a part like } \\
\ce{C_6H_{10}} \text{ where one carbon has a double bond instead of two single bonds, making it a } \ce{=CH-cyclohexyl} \text{ structure)}.\\
\text{"methyl" part indicates that a methyl group (CH}_3\text{) is included here.}
$$
However, another part of the group should be understood as "cyclohexylidenemethyl" group which means:
$$
\text{"cyclohexylidene" refers to a cyclohexane ring where there is an exocyclic double bond (similar to cyclohexanone where the carbonyl oxygen is removed such that the carbon has only two bonds, one of which is a double bond outside the ring). The cyclohexylidene group looks like a cyclohexane ring where one of the carbons has a double bond connecting outside the ring. Since it's called "cyclohexylidenemethyl" (which looks like a (cyclohexylidene)CH$_2$ group), the "methylene" part might be a part connected to the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine.}
$$
Thus another part "1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)" should be considered as a part where a group "\text{-CH$_2$-cyclohexylidene}" is connected to the nitrogen atom of the 3-methylpyrrolidine. To make it clear, the part connected to the nitrogen is thus:
$$
\text{-CH=cyclohexyl} \text{ or specifically written as } \text{N-CH$_2$-cyclohexylidene}.
$$
However, the question might be a little imprecise here because "1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine" could be interpreted as:
$$
\mathrm{N-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine}.
$$
Another part says "cyclohexylidenemethyl," which seems to imply a group like:
$$
\mathrm{-CH}_2\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{10} \text{ (cyclohexylidene part should be a cyclohexane ring with an exocyclic double bond, i.e., a structure like cyclohexylidene)}
$$
However, what might be more reasonable here is that the "1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)" part makes you think it should be:
$$
\text{N-CH=cyclohexyl}.
$$
However, this does not make sense chemically since as a substituent it seems there's a chain where a benzene-like part could be attached directly to the nitrogen atom such that:
$$
\mathrm{H_3C} - \underset{1}{\text{(N-CH=cyclohexyl)}} - \underset{2}{\text{CH_2}} - \underset{3}{\text{CH}} - \underset{\text{(methyl substituent)}}{\underset{\text{(4-CH3)}}{\text{CH}}} - \underset{4}{\text{CH_2}}
$$
However, a more structured question might be treated as a nucleophilic attack reaction where the pyrrolidine is reacting with a compound A to give us that product where the part attached to the nitrogen connects through a methylene bridge (CH2) to another part called cyclohexylidene. 

However, a more common reaction where secondary amines (such as pyrrolidine) react typically produces imine derivatives where you need a carbonyl compound such as an aldehyde or a ketone. It looks like a Mannich reaction would be a candidate reaction here where an amine reacts with formaldehyde and another compound containing a carbonyl group such as a ketone to produce a product where a methylene group is inserted.
However, if the intention here is to make an imine bond directly on the nitrogen atom reacting with a carbonyl compound such as cyclohexanone, an imine could be formed, but the question seems to indicate a reaction where the amine reacts with something that contains a "cyclohexylidene" part.

However, a more likely candidate might be:

Cyclohexanone reacts with an amine such as 3-methylpyrrolidine might initially form an imine if water is removed. However, that reaction usually requires acetic acid or H$_2$SO$_4$ as a catalyst. Another plausible candidate might be cyclohexanone itself reacting where an Enamine reaction could be considered where the nitrogen forms a part of the conjugated system (if an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group reacts with a secondary amine).

Another interesting reaction might be a reaction where "cyclohexylmethanol" could dehydrate under acidic conditions forming some form of a carbocation which reacts similarly.

However, "cyclohexylidenemethyl" part should be interpreted specifically being a group where there is a double bond connecting a carbon atom of the cyclohexyl ring directly bonded to a $\mathrm{CH}$ part connected to the nitrogen atom (forming a group such as $\mathrm{-CH=cylcohexyl}$).

However, a more common compound called cyclohexanone could react similarly where:
$$
\text{Pyrrolidine + Cyclohexanone under acid-catalyzed conditions might make an imine, but usually imines need a primary amine.}
$$
However, considering an amine like pyrrolidine is a secondary amine, another reaction called “enamine” formation seems more logical where cyclohexanone reacts with a secondary amine under acid-catalyzed conditions might make an enamine where cyclohexanone is used:
$$
\text{Cyclohexanone was "A" here and the acid catalyst is usually a weak acid like "p-toluenesulfonic acid" (TsOH) or occasionally acetic acid.}
$$
However, that does not make sense here because enamine generation occurs usually with a secondary amine reacting with a ketone such that water splits off and makes a compound where there should be a double bond between the nitrogen and the carbon where the reaction looks like:
$$
\mathrm{N} \text{ (from pyrrolidine)} + \mathrm{C=O} \text{ (from cyclohexanone)} \rightarrow \mathrm{N=C} \text{ (part of the pyrrolidine ring)}
$$
However, an enamine reaction generates a product where part of the pyrrolidine structure itself includes a double bond where nitrogen is connected to a carbon which also connects to another set of carbon atoms such as:
$$
\mathrm{N-CH=CH} \text{ group where another part connects here.}
$$
However, it seems we need something that adds a "cyclohexylidenemethyl" group to the nitrogen atom of 3-methylpyrrolidine. 

However, such additions might happen if we use cyclohexanone and an aldehyde such as formaldehyde where:
$$
\text{A is cyclohexanone + methanal}/ \text{formaldehyde.}
$$
However, that seems a bit overly complicated. Based on the given options:

1. A might be "cyclohexanone."
2. The acid catalyst B could be a mild acid such as "acetic acid" or "p-toluene sulfonic acid (TsOH)."

However, a safer candidate compound for A should logically be such that:

Let us encode the reaction once again:
$$
\text{3 Methylpyrrolidine + Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde $\rightarrow$ 1-[1-(Cyclohexyl)methyl]-3-methylpyrrolidine}
$$
This makes sense only if what you need here is:
1. Adding a cyclohexyl part where one carbon is part of a double bond (formed via a condensation reaction where water is lost).

However, the question seems to hint at a "cyclohexylidenemethyl" group added at the N position. Another candidate for A could be "cyclohexanecarbaldehyde" to form an imine, but this seems rather unlikely as an imine is normally formed from a primary amine reacting with an aldehyde or a ketone and removing a water molecule.

Hence, a logical candidate seems to be another equivalent of `Cyclohexylideneacetaldehyde` which is a compound with a cyclohexylidene attached to an aldehyde. This would make something like:
$$
\mathrm{3-methylpyrrolidine} + \text{(cyclohexylidone part-CHO)} \text{ (which is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde if we need only a single carbon connecting to the cyclohexane ring without any double bond.)}
$$

Another option that makes much more sense is that for compound A, one plausible candidate could structurally resembling `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` reacts with the amine. However, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` doesn’t contain a "cyclohexylidene" part which means there should be a double bond within the ring itself or more logically a `cyclohexylidene acetaldehyde`: `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` structure looks like:
$$
\mathrm{O} \\
\mathrm{||} \\
\mathrm{C_6H_{11} - C - H}
$$
However, a cyclohexylidenemethanol might dehydrate to form something that reacts like such an aldehyde species:
$$
\mathrm{C_6H_{10}=CHCHO}.
$$
However, this seems a bit more uncommon.

### Another simpler choice could be cyclohexanone itself reacts here:
$$
\text{3-methylpnidine + cyclohexanone $\underrightarrow{\text{catalyst}}$ N-(1-cyclohexylidene-2-propyl)pyrrolidine.
}
$$
However, to make sure they indeed make it clear in the choices.

Possible candidates might be:
1) `A cyclohexanone` and `B is piperidine`
2) `A cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` and `B is trace amount of acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid (or acetic acid).`

Since we need a "1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine," it seems that a candidate matching would be:

1) Compound A should maybe be something straightforward like `cyclohexanon` (cyclohexan圃ne might make an enamine because pyrrolidine is a secondary amine), but that leaves no "CH2" remaining which seems crucial from the "cyclohexylidenemethyl" part. Hence, `cyclohexanecarbaldehyde` seems closer.
