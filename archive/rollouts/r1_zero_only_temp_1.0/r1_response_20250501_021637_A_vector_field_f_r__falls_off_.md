# Original Question

A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, ∇.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, ∇ and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?

To solve for the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r})$ that only has a radial component and whose magnitude decreases as $1/r^2$, we need to use the given statement that the field only has a component in the radial direction and that its magnitude is $f(r) = 1/r^2$.

The vector field can thus be expressed as:
$$
\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) = f(r) \hat{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}.
$$
However, it might be useful to recall that a vector field described as "falling off as $1/r^2$" typically means that the magnitude $|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r})|$ is equal to $1/r^2$. Thus, here:
$$
|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r})| = \frac{1}{r^2} \implies \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) = f(r) \hat{\mathbf{r}} \text{ where } f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2}
$$
so:
$$
\mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}.
$$
The question requires us to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field within a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin. That is, we need to calculate:
$$
\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, d\tau,
$$
where $V$ is the volume of a sphere centered at the origin with radius $R$.

However, we need to recall the divergence theorem (also known as Gauss's theorem), which states that:
$$
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, d\tau = \oint_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A}.
$$
where $S$ is the boundary surface of the volume $V$.

The surface $S$ here is the surface of the sphere of radius $R$, so $d\mathbf{A} = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \hat{\mathbf{r}}$ (since $dV = r^2\sin\theta \, dr \, d\theta \, d\phi$ in spherical coordinates and $d\mathbf{A}$ has a magnitude $dA = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi$, directed along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ on the surface of the sphere).

To solve the surface integral:
$$
\oint_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \oint_{r = R} \left(\frac{1}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}\right) \cdot (R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \,\, \hat{\mathbf{r}}).
$$
However, on the surface $r = R$, so substitute $r = R$ into the expression for $\mathbf{f}$:
$$
\mathbf{f} \big|_{r=R} = \left(\frac{1}{R^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}\right).
$$
The differential surface area vector on a sphere of radius $R$ is:
$$
d\mathbf{A} = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi\,\, \hat{\mathbf{r}}.
$$
So:
$$
\mathbf{f} \big|_{r=R} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \left(\frac{1}{R^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}\right) \cdot \left(R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \, \hat{\mathbf{r}}\right).
$$
Recall that $\hat{\mathbf{r}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}} = 1$, so:
$$
\mathbf{f} \big|_{r=R} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \left(\frac{1}{R^2}\right) \cdot R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \sin\theta \, d\theta \ d\phi.
$$
The surface integral thus becomes:
$$
\oint_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \oint_{r=R} \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
$$
This integral spans the full solid angle for a sphere ($\theta$ from $0$ to $\pi$ and $\phi$ from $0$ to $2\pi$):
$$
\oint_{r=R} \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \int_{\theta=0}^{\pi} \sin\theta \, d\theta \int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi} d\phi.
$$
Evaluate the inner integral first:
$$
\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}d\phi = 2\pi.
$$
Then evaluate the outer integral:
$$
\int_{\theta=0}^{\pi} \sin\theta \, d\theta = [-\cos\theta]_{0}^{\pi} = -\cos\pi - (-\cos0) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
$$
Thus:
$$
\oint_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 2\times 2\pi = 4\pi.
$$
Therefore:
$$
\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, d\tau = 4\pi.
$$

Another way to explicitly verify this is to directly compute the divergence $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}$ for $\mathbf{f} = (1/r^2) \hat{\mathbf{r}}$. For a field that only has a radial component $f_r\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, the divergence in spherical coordinates becomes:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^2 f_r\right).
$$
In this case, $f_r = 1/r^2$, so:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{1}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}\right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2}\right).
$$
Since $r^2 \times \frac{1}{r^2} = 1$,
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}(1) = \frac{1}{r^2} \times 0 = 0,
$$
provided $r \neq 0$.

However, the question states that our volume integral should be evaluated "inside the volume of a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin." While the divergence appears to be zero everywhere except possibly at $r=0$, the divergence theorem indicates that the volume integral should be $4\pi$, unless there is a point-source-like behavior at $r=0$ which makes the divergence a Dirac delta function at $r=0$. 

This seems a bit conflicting initially, because the divergence seems to be zero anywhere where $r \neq 0$. However, to make sense of the $r=0$ singularity, recall that the term $\nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}\right)$ behaves like a Dirac delta function at $r=0$. In fact, the well-known identity is:
$$
\nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}\right) = 4\pi \delta^3(\mathbf{r}).
$$
This follows from the fact that the surface integral of $\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}$ over any closed surface enclosing the origin is $4\pi$. Hence, the volume integral of the divergence for a sphere including the origin should be:
$$
\int_V \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}\right) d\tau = \int_V 4\pi \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) \, d\tau.
$$
Due to the sifting property of the Dirac delta function for a volume including the origin:
$$
\int_V 4\pi \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) \ d\tau = 4\pi,
$$
provided that the origin lies within the volume $V$.

Based on this reasoning, the volume integral of $\nabla\cdot\mathbf{f}$ for the given problem thus appears to be:
$$
\boxed{4\pi}.
$$

However, the question seems to be asking us to identify which answer is most appropriate. However, the question does not provide multiple choices here. However, the question appears to be asking what the volume integral of the divergence of the given vector field is within a sphere centered at the origin where the field is given as:
$$
\mathbf{f} = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}.
$$
The reasoning indicates that the answer appears to be $4\pi$, regardless of sphere radius $R$ (as long as it contains the origin).

However, since integral values should generally be independent of the radius $R$ for this specific field as long as $r=0$ is included in the integral, the question makes us re-check what happens if $r=0$ is not included in the volume integral which should not be the case here because the question states that the volume integral should be performed "inside the volume of a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin." Thus $r=0$ is indeed within the integral volume unless $R=0$, which makes no sense here.

However, one might question what happens if the volume excluded $r=0$, such as a volume that only includes part of the space where $r \geq R$, but that is not the situation here. The question explicitly states that the integral should be taken within a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin properly encompassing $r=0$ until $r = R$. 

Based on the divergence theorem, the answer thus should be verified as $4\pi$. However, the question statement mentions answering which option is most appropriate. However, there are no options referenced here explicitly. However, the reasoning seems valid until now where:
$$
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
$$
Another way might be to directly solve the integral:
$$
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_0^R \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} \left[\nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}\right) \right] r^2 \sin\theta \, d\phi \, d\theta \, dr.
$$
However, $\nabla \cdot \left(\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{d^{r^2}}\right)$ is zero everywhere except at $r=0$ where it acts as a delta function $\delta^3(\mathbf{r})$. But for $r \neq 0$, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}$ is $0$, so the integral should simply be $4\pi$ only due to the contribution at $r=0$.

Thus, the most appropriate answer for the integral should be $4\pi$.
