# Original Question

You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? 
After tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:
- resistance of g1: 75% of control
- resistance of g2: 0% from control
- resistance of g3: 50% from control
-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control
- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control
- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control

Which conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?

To solve the question about the interaction between the three candidate genes $G1$, $G2$, and $G3$ and their effects on anthracnose resistance in white lupine, we need to analyze the given experimental results:

Let $WT$ denote the wild type resistance level defined as 100% in the question statement. We need to interpret what the resistance percentages mean for the mutants $g1$, $g2$, and $g3$ (single knock-outs) and the double mutants $g1g2$, $g1g3$, and $g2g3$.

#### Given Data:
1. Wild type (control) resistance level is defined as 100%.
2. Resistance of $g1$ mutant is 75% of the control. Thus, $g1$ retains 75% of the wild type resistance. That means loss of $G1$ gene function leads to a 25% decrease in resistance compared to the wild type, which suggests that $G1$ contributes to resistance.
3. Resistance of $g2$ mutan is 0% of the control. Thus, $g2$ retains 0% of the wild type resistance. Loss of $G2$ gene function leads to a total loss of resistance.
4. Resistance of $g3$ mutant is 50% of the control. Thus, $g3$ retains 50% of the wild type resistance. Loss of $G3$ gene function leads to a 50% decrease in resistance.
5. Resistance of $g1g3$ double mutant is 10% of the control. Thus, $g1g3$ retains 10% of the wild type resistance. 
6. Resistance of $g2g3$ double mutant is 0% of the control. Thus, $g2g3$ retains 0% of the wild type resistance. 
7. Resistance of $g1g2$ double mutant is 0% of the control. Thus, $g1g2$ retains 0% of the wild type resistance.

#### Initial Analysis for Single Mutants:

- $g1$ has a resistance level of 90% + 10% of something seems redundant here. Thus, $g1$ has a resistance level of $75\% \text{ of wild type (100\%)} = 75\% \text{ WT}$.
- $g2$ has a resistance level of $0\% \text{ WT}$.
- $g3$ has a resistance level of $50\% \text{ WT}$.

#### Simple Interpretations for Single Mutations:
    
    1. For $g2$, knocking out $G2$ seems to completely abolish resistance (since its resistance is $0\%$ of the wild type resistance).
    2. For $g1$ and $g3$, knocking out $G1$ reduces resistance to $75\%$ of the wild type, whereas knocking out $G3$ reduces resistance to $50\%$ of the wild type.

Double mutants result in:
    
    - $g1g2$ has resistance level $0\% \text{ WT}$.
    - $g1g3$ has resistance level $10\% \text{ WT}$.
    - $g2g3$ has resistance level $0\% \text{ WT}$.

#### To determine the possible epistatic relationships among these genes, let us recall that a gene $A$ is said to be epistatic to another gene $B$ if the phenotype of $A$ masks the phenotype of $B$.

To identify if one gene acts upstream of another, it is important to check two main points:

1. If a mutation in $G2$ leads to a total loss of resistance ($0\%$ resistance), and $g1g2$ also leads to a total loss of resistance ($0\%$ resistance), which is no different from $g2$ alone, it could suggest that $G2$ might act upstream of $G1$, or that $G2$ is essential for any resistance. Another way round might be that $g2$ is such a strong phenotype ($0\%$ resistance) that adding another mutation like $g1$ might not make a significant difference. Another consideration here might be whether $g1$ and $gi$ ($i \in \{2,3\}$) interactions show a combined additive or synergistic loss when both genes are knocked out.

2. However, if $g2$ already makes the plant fully susceptible ($0\%$ resistance), any double mutation including $g2$ such as $g1g2$ or $g2g3$ results in $0\%$ resistance. This indicates that $G2$ seems to be a critical gene for anthracnose resistance.
    
#### Analyzing $g1$ and $g3$ interaction separately:
    
    - $g1$ has a resistance of $75\%$ WT.
    - $g3$ has a resistance of $50\%$ WT.
    
    If $G1$ and $G3$ acted independently (in parallel pathways), the double mutant $g1g3$ might be expected to exhibit a resistance level equal to the multiplicative effect or an additive effect. However, a purely multiplicative effect would be $0.75 \times 0.5 = 0.375$ (37.5%) of wild type resistance if $g1$ and $g3$ act independently in parallel biochemical pathways where the total resulting resistance is a function of both $g1$ and $g3$. Another simpler case could be an additive effect where $g1$ reduces resistance by 25% (giving $100\% - 25\% = 75\%$ WT resistance), $g3$ reduces resistance by 50% (giving $100\% - 50\% = 50\%$ WT resistance); if the gene effects are purely additive in parallel pathways, $g1g3$ might be $100\% - 25\% - 50\% = 25\%$ WT resistance if the genes act independently but additively. However, the actual resistance for $g1g3$ is $10\%$ of WT resistance, which is less than what is expected from either multiplicative or purely additive interaction (37.5% or 25%).

However, if one gene acts upstream of the other, knocking out the "upstream" gene should make the "downstream" gene irrelevant. For instance, if $G1$ acted upstream of $G3$, then:
    
    - $g1$ mutation makes $G3$ less effective (since $g1$ reduces resistance to $75\%$, that suggests that $G1$ may activate $G3$, thus $g1g3$ might resemble $g1$, while $g3$ might make $G1$ less effective such that $g1g3$ might resemble $g1$. However, $g1g3$ has a lower resistance (10% of wild type) compared to $g1$ (75%) or $g3$ (50%).

    Similarly, if $G3$ acts upstream of $G1$, then $g3g1$ might also seem like $g3$. However, $g1g3$ shows a lower resistance level than $g1$ or $g3$ independently, so $g3g1$ does not strictly resemble $g1$ nor $g3}$, indicating that they likely interact in a more complex way.

However analyzing if $G1$ and $G3$ are both downstream genes which require functional $G2$ for activation might help establish a hierarchy. 

Since $g2$ (0% WT resistance) is the most severe single mutant phenotype, $G2$ could be upstream of $G1$ and $G3$, where loss of $G2$ precludes the function of $G1$ and $G3$. However, if $G2$ acts independently of $G1$ and $G3$, we need to confirm if $g2$ makes $g1g2$ and $g2g3$ results identical to $g2$ alone.

Another possible interpretation could be that genes $G1$ and $G3$ act in a common pathway where $G2$ is a key regulator. From such a scenario, $g1g2$ shows the same resistance level as $g2$ alone (0% WT resistance), suggesting that once $G2$ is knocked out, knocking out $G1$ doesn’t make any difference on resistance level. This might suggest that $G2$ could be acting upstream of $G1$. 

Similarly, $g2g3$ shows $0\%$ WT resistance, identical to $g2$ alone. Therefore:
    
    - $g1g2$ shows an effect similar to $g2$, which implies that $G2$ might act upstream of $amount G1$ or might be a key gene whose knockout makes $G1$ irrelevant.
    - $g2g3$ also shows an effect similar to $g2$, which suggests that $G2$ might act upstream of $G3$ as well.

However, there seems to be a slight residual resistance in $g1g3$. The question states that $g1g3$ has $10\%$ resistance of the wild type value. This suggests that $g1$ and $g3$ might operate in a partially redundant pathway such that knocking out both genes leads to a weaker resistance level than knocking out either gene individually.

Based on the question statement that one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of the others, $G2$ seems critical given that knocking out $G2$ completely eliminates resistance. Hence, $G2$ might act upstream of $G1$ and $G3$. Another observation is that $g1g3$ displays a resistance of $10\%$, which is lower than $g1$ (75%) and $g3$ (50%) individually, suggesting that $G1$ and $G3$ might act in partially redundant parallel pathways where $g1g3$ leads to a severe resistance decrease but not to complete loss like seen in $g2$. However, the analysis might require another round of deeper biochemical studies to confirm the exact nature of the interaction.

#### Probable Conclusion:

Based on the provided loss-of-function mutant studies, a likely conclusion is that:
    
The gene $G2$ is a crucial gene for anthracnose resistance such that its knockout leads to complete loss of resistance. Moreover, given that $g1g22$ and $g2g3$ do not show any additional effect beyond what $g2$ alone shows, $G2$ likely acts upstream of $G1$ and $G3$. Furthermore, the $g1g3$ double mutant shows a significant decrease in resistance, suggesting $G1$ and $G3$ might act in partly parallel pathways yet still both require functional $G2$ for any residual resistance.

Thus, a possible genetic pathway could be:
$$G2 \rightarrow (G1, G3)$$

However, another interpretation could be that $G2$ plays such an essential role that without it (as shown when $g2$ is knocked out), the functions of $G1$ and $G3$ do not contribute significantly to resistance. So $G2$ is possibly a key regulator or transcription factor acting upstream of $G1$ and $G3$. Another possibility might be that $G2$ works independently such that $G1$ and $G3$ contribute to resistance only partially when $G2$ is intact. However, once $G2$ is absent, $G1$ and $G3$ only contribute minimally if anything.

Based on the given data and reasoning, a valid conclusion seems to be:
$G2$ might be a transcription factor acting upstream of $G1$ and $G3$.

Based on the question statement, it looks like $G2$ might indeed be a key transcription factor in this genetic pathway where $G2$ acts upstream of $G1$ and $G3$. 

Thus, a reasoned answer could be that:
**$G2$ acts upstream of $G1$ and $G3$, where $G1$ and $G3$ might contribute independently to resistance but are heavily dependent on $G2.$**

Another way to validate whether $G2$ indeed acts upstream can be verified through the fact that $g1g3$ still shows some resistance (10%), while $g2$, $g1g2$, $g2g3$ all show no resistance at all. This implies that only when $G2$ is functional do $G1$ and $G3$ make a noticeable difference (since $g1g3$ still retains a small part of resistance).

However, what seems most plausible here is that $G1$ and $G3$ provide some residual pathway that is only active if $G2$ is active. Yet another possibility might be that $G2$ acts as a main contributor such that any double knockout including $g2$ leads to a complete loss of resistance. 

Thus, a more structured conclusion might be:
1) $ \textbf{G2}$ acts upstream such that when $G2$ is knocked out, any additional mutations do not have a significant effect because the main gene required for anthracnose resistance ($G2$) is already absent.
2) $G1$ and $G3$ contribute additionally once $G2$ is functioning properly.

#### Conclusion based on the question seems to imply that:
$$G2 \text{ acts upstream of } G1 \text{ and } G3.$$

Additionally, the description mentions that one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of the other genes, which makes our reasoning about $G2$ being a transcription factor align well with the statement. 

However, a round of genetic or biochemical analysis such as gene expression studies might be needed to validate which one of these genes acts as a transcription factor explicitly. However, $G2$ appears to be a candidate for a key regulator based on the provided data. Therefore, one should make a conclusion such as:

**Based on the given results, $G2$ acts upstream of $G1$ and $G3$.**
Thus, $G2$ might be the transcription factor.

Alternatively, you should verify what "upstream acting" means here: it means $G2$ could be the regulator that activates $G1$ and $G3$, which makes sense given that $g2$ alone destroys resistance entirely.

\text{}
However, let us make a more formal reasoning and validate:

1. $g2$ alone results in $0\%$ resistance, implying $G2$ is critical for any resistance observed.
2. $g1g2$ and $g2g3$ both result in $0\%$ resistance identical to $g2$ alone, thus supporting that $g2$ presence dominates other genes' knockouts. 

Considering this, it makes sense that $G2$ might be a transcription factor that regulates $G1$ and $G3$. However, another possible question here is why $g1g3$ only results in $10\%$ resistance. This could be because $G1$ and $G3$ still contribute individually some basal level of resistance if $G2$ is functional. However, combining $g1$ and $g3$ reduces the resistance to merely $10\%$, suggesting that $G1$ and $G3$ might work in partially redundant pathways which help if only one of $G1$ or $G3$ malfunction.

Another way to interpret may be that:
1. Normal resistance relies on $G2$.
2. $G1$ and $G3$ contribute independently such that knocking out both $G1$ and $G3$ only gets us down to $10\%$ resistance if $G2$ is still functioning (since $g1g3$ still shows some resistance unlike $g2$).

Ultimately, the critical part here appears to be that $G2$ acts upstream or is a transcription factor such that $G1$ and $G3$ might contribute for a minor part independently if $G2$ is preserved.

However, another part of the "10%" residual resistance in $g1g3$ could be due to unknown pathways where $10\%$ might be a residual function not covered by $G1$, $G2$, or $G3$. Thus, $g1$, $g2$, and $g3$ double knockout should be checked if $g1g2g3$ would make resistance $0\%$.

However, the suggested answer seems indeed robust that:
$\boxed{G2 \text{ acts upstream of } G1 \text{ and } G3}$ seems the most reasonable conclusion based on the given data.
