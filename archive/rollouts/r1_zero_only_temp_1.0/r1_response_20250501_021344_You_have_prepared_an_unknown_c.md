# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

To identify the unknown compound from the given characterization techniques (FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry), we need to first interpret the given information.

#### FTIR Spectrum:
1. **Very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm^-1:**
    - A broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 typically indicates the presence of an O-H bond (alcohol or carboxylic acid). However, a peak around 3300 cm^-1 is more typical for O-H stretches, while a "very broad" peak at 3000 cm^-1 is still a strong indication of an O-H bond where the peak might be centered near 3000 cm^-1 but extends broadly across that region.

2. **Two other strong absorption peaks observed at 1700 cm^-1 and 1650 cm^-1:**
    - A peak at 1700 cm^-1 typically indicates a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be found in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides. However, amides would typically show additional peaks corresponding to N-H bonds.
    - A peak at 1650 cm^-1 typically corresponds to a C=C double bond (alkene).

#### 1H NMR Spectrum:
1. **Several peaks including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens:**
    - "Vinyl hydrogens" refer to hydrogens attached to a carbon that is part of a carbon-carbon double bond (i.e., hydrogens on a C=C double bond where the hydrogens are directly attached to a sp^2 hybridized carbon atom). Thus, a compound contains a C=C bond.

#### Mass Spectrometry:
1. **Fragment peak at m/z = 45:**
    - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 could be due to a CH3CHOH+ fragment (which corresponds to an ethyl alcohol fragment if one H is abstracted) or a COOH+ fragment. However, the most common fragment that corresponds to a mass of 45 is often attributed to a C2H5O+ fragment where one common such fragment is the radical cation [C2H5O]+, which could be derived from a part of a larger compound where there is an ethoxy group (C2H5O). Another common candidate is the protonated form (such as C2H5OH2+, which is less likely because such a fragment usually comes from a molecular ion that contains an oxygen).
    
    Another relevant fragment could be CH2OH which has a molecular weight of 31 once you add a proton, it becomes CH3OH2+, which has a mass of roughly 33 (which seems incorrect based on the question).

Let us interpret what a fragment at m/z = 45 could be in terms of a neutral fragment:
    
    - The fragment could be [CH2=CH-OH]+, which should have a mass of $29 + 16 = 45$, i.e., hydroxy-ethenyl (enol form usually unstable, but in mass spectrometry fragmentation could still result in such a fragment).
    
    However, another common fragment is [CH3CH2O+] where:
    
$$
\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{O}^+ \text{ could be } C_2H_5O = 2 \times 12 + 5 \times 1 + 16 = 24 + 5 + 16 = 45.
$$
This fragment might suggest the presence of an ethyl group bonded to an oxygen such as in alcohols or ethers where a part of the molecule is C2H5O.
    
Another possible interpretation is that $45$ could be corresponded to a carboxyl fragment CH3CH2OH2+. Another valid possibility is that this could be a part of an acid group - COOH (mass = 45), which makes us lean towards a fragment such as "COOH+" or a nearby part of the molecule that splits off to make a fragment with a charged part such as COOH^+ which makes sense if there is indeed a carboxylic acid group present because the mass of COOH is:
$$
\mathrm{COOH} = 12 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 45.
$$

Based on the given potential chemical formulas (C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2), we need now to analyze each one individually.

#### Degree of Unsaturation (Double Bond Equivalent, DBE) for the given chemical formulas:
1. $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}$:
$$
DBE = \frac{2 \times 6 + 2 - 12}{2} = 1.
$$
2. $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{10}\text{O}$:
$$
DBE = \frac{2 \times 6 + 2 - 10}{2} = 2.
$$
3. $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_{2}$:
$$
DBE = \frac{2 \times 6 + 2 - 10}{2} = 2.
$$
4. $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_{2}$:
$$
DBE = \frac{2 \times 6 + 2 - 12}{2} = 1.

$$

#### Considering the FTIR data along with the given HNMR spectrum mentioning "vinyl hydrogens" (which implies a C=C double bond):
    
1. $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{12}\text{O}$ has a DBE of 1, which could be satisfied by a ring or one double bond (such as an aldehyde or ketone, which accounts for the $1700\ \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ signal where the other might be a bit ambiguous).
    
2. $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}$ has a DBE of 2 and could be satisfied by two double bonds or one triple bond or one ring plus one double bond such as:
    - One C=O (probably from a ketone or aldehyde) which fits the 1700 cm^-1 peak.
    - Another double bond might be C=C which fits the 1650 cm^-1 peak.
    - Another possibility could be a single triple bond such as C≡C (which usually appears at about 2200 cm^-1, unknown if this fits here).
    
3. $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_{2}$ has a DBE of 2 and could similarly be satisfied by two double bonds or one triple bond or one ring plus one double bond. It also contains an additional oxygen compared to $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}$, which makes acids or esters more likely candidates where one DBE comes from a C=O bond.

4. $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_{2}$ has a DBE of 1 which could be satisfied by one double bond or one ring such as:
    - One C=O which fits the 1700 cm^-1 FTIR peak. Another possible functional group could be a secondary alcohol or ether (since there are two oxygen atoms here).

#### Analyzing the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹:
- A broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is a strong indication of an O-H bond which could be from either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid (which might also contribute a C=O signal at 1700 cm^-1).

Based on the given FTIR data:
    - The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 could be interpreted as an O-H stretch (strong candidate for an alcohol or carboxylic acid).
    - The peak at 1700 cm^-1 could be interpreted as a C=O stretch.
    - The peak at 1650 cm^-1 corresponds to a C=C stretch.
    
Thus, the compound seems to have at least an O-H (making an alcohol ($R-OH$) or a carboxylic acid ($R-COOH$)) group, a C=O group and a C=C bond.

#### Let us explore each proposed formula individually:
1. $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{12}\text{O}$ (DBE=1): 
    - Can support one double bond or one ring structure such as a cyclic alcohol or an aldehyde/ketone where the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 could be an alcohol group. Another part of the compound could carry a C=O (aldehyde or ketone at 1700 cm⁻¹), but it could also be a C=C bond if the broad peak is O-H in an alcohol. However, a second double bond signal at 1650 cm^-1 makes us suspect that two double bond equivalents are necessary for a C=O bond and a C=C bond, which would make us need a compound with a DBE of at least 2.

2. $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}$ (DBE=2): 
    - Allows for two double bonds or a ring and a double bond. It fits well if one DBE is a C=O (1700 cm^-1) and another is a C=C (1650 cm^-1). However, what about the 3000 cm^-1 peak? It could potentially be an alcohol group where the rest of the formula makes sense if it includes a C=O and a C=C bond such as in an enol structure (but enols are generally unstable unless stabilized by resonance such as in a phenol, which is not a chain structure here). Another candidate could be a α,β-unsaturated ketone where an alcohol group is separately present.
    
3. $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_{2}$ (DBE=2):
    - This provides two oxygens which makes this a good candidate for a carboyxlic acid where one DBE comes from C=O (1700 cm^-1) of a carboxyl group which still allows for another DBE which could be a C=C bond (1650 cm^-1). Furthermore, a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 could indeed indicate a carboxylic acid O-H stretching which normally appears as a very broad peak due to hydrogen bonding.
    
4. $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_{2}$ (DBE=1):
    - Only one degree of unsaturation, which could be satisfied by a C=O or a C=C bond but not both simultaneously unless another ring is used (which did not appear in the given details).

#### For mass spectrometry, recall that a prominent fragment at m/z of 45 is often a part typical for a fragment such as COOH+ fragment (mass = 45) if arising from a carboxylic acid.

Based on the reasoning:
We need a formula that includes:
- An O-H group (broad peak at 3000 cm^-1).
- A C=O group (strong peak at 1700 cm^-1).
- A C=C double bond (strong peak at 1650 cm^-1).
- A fragment peak at m/z = 45, which could be a COOH+ fragment.

The $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_{2}$ formula seems most fitting here because:
   - It satisfies a DBE of 2 which allows for a C=O and a C=C simultaneously.
   - Its two oxygens make a carboxylic acid functionality plausible (COOH).

However, double-checking the C6H10O2 formula, an unsaturated fatty acid might fit best here where there is a C=O bond from a carboxylic acid (1700 cm^-1), a broad O-H stretch (3000 cm^-1), another double bond (1650 cm^-1), and a likely fragment at mass 45 could be due to the COOH fragment. 

Conversely, for $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}$, there is still a possibility that one double bond is a C=O bond and another is a C=C bond, but the single oxygen makes it harder for us to explain the very broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 which seems to indicate a carboxylic acid rather than an alcohol (although an alcohol could still exist here).

Based on the cumulative evidence, the unknown compound seems most likely corresponds to **$\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_{2}$**.

However, a fragment with mass 45 could additionally indicate a CH3CH2O+ fragment which could be present in compounds like ethyl esters. Another fragment candidate is a carboxyl fragment COOH+, which makes the choice of $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_{2}$ more convincing if the compound includes carboxylic acid functionality such as in some unsaturated fatty acids.

Based on the reasoning above, the most probable chemical formula seems to be:
#### Answer: C6H10O2

To validate our reasoning, a possible compound structure might be a molecule such as sorbic acid which has a formula $\text{C}_6\text{H}_8\text{O}_2$. However, this is a bit off from the candidate structures here yet gives us a convincing reasoning direction. Another candidate could be hex-3-enoic acid (formula $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_{2}$) which makes sense here.

However, verifying another common compound such as 3-hexenoic acid (CH3CH2CH=CHCH2COOH) makes us check:
   - IR shows broad OH at roughly 3000 cm^-1 (carboxylic acid)
   - IR shows a C=O peak at 1700 cm^-1 (carboxylic acid)
   - IR peaks at 1650 cm^-1 (C=C double bond)
   - 1H NMK indicating vinyl hydrogens (hydrogens on a C=C bond).

Thus, $\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_2$ seems the most likely candidate among the choices provided.

Thus, the unknown compound should most likely follow the chemical formula:
$\text{C}_{6}\text{H}_{10}\text{O}_{2}$.
