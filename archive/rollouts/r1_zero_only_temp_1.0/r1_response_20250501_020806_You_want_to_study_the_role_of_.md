# Original Question

You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine®, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected. In the series of tests you undertake to identify the cause, you realize that the sequence of the plus strand of your construct reads:

You annoyingly notice the reason.

\boxed{The reason you are unable to overexpress your protein is that there is a premature stop codon (`TGA`) immediately after the HA tag sequence in the DNA construct. This stop codon causes translation to terminate early, resulting in a truncated protein consisting of only a few amino acids (including part of the HA tag) instead of a full-length GADD45G protein fused with the HA tag.}

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

To solve for what might be going wrong with your protein expression of the GADD45G gene when you try to overexpress it in Chinese hamster ovary cells, we need to verify if the provided DNA sequence for your construct is intact and correctly encodes for what you aim for.

The question mentions that you need to introduce "a single influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein." The HA tag is a commonly used epitope tag with the amino acid sequence `YPYDVPDYA` (abbreviated form `YPYDVPDYA`). The question states that the HA tag should be "at the N-terminus" of your recombinant GADD45G protein sequence. 

The HA tag has a well-characterized DNA sequence that encodes it. To identify what might be wrong, let us first recall the HA tag amino acid sequence and find out its DNA encoding:

HA tag amino acid sequence: `Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala` which is encoded by the codons:
- Tyr (Y): TAC or TAT
- Pro (P): CCC, CCA, CCG, or CCT
- Asp (D): GAC or GAT
- Val (V): GTT, GTC, GTA, or GTG
- Pro (P): CCC, CCA, CCG, or CCT
- Asp (D): GAC or GAT
- Tyr (Y): TAC or TAT
- Ala (A): GCG, GCA, GCC, or GCT

The most commonly used DNA sequence encoding for the HA tag is:
`5' TAT CCA TAT GAT GTC CCA GAT TAC GCT 3'`, which translates to `YPYDVPDYA`.

However, the provided DNA sequence from the question appears as follows:
```
5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'
```

To analyze what might be wrong, we need to first verify if the start codon `ATG` is present for protein translation initiation. 

The sequence begins with an `ATG` which is a start codon corresponding to the amino acid Methionine (Met or M):
5'`ATG`TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`AAAT`GACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCC(...)3'
This means that the first codon (ATG) encodes a Methionine residue (which is supposed to be there as the translation starts).

Another part of the question tells us that the HA tag sequence should be at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. Thus, we need to check where the HA tag DNA encoding appears in the provided DNA sequence.

The HA tag itself should typically appear right after the start codon `ATG`. Thus, the part encoding HA should appear next after `ATG` in the sequence:
5'`ATG`(`TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCC`)(...)3'.

However, it seems like there might be another part of the sequence that encodes the tag itself where the question mentions that "the HA tag should be at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein." However, the sequence after the initial `ATG` starts immediately with what looks eerily similar to the part encoding HA tag:
`TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAG(...)`

Let's break down the part that follows the `ATG` start codon:
```
ATG(TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA)TGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA
```
Let's translate the part after `ATG` until the stop codon `TGA` (which appears at the end of the provided sequence):

To translate DNA into protein, we need to divide the DNA string into codons (triplets of nucleotides) starting right after the `ATG` start codon until a stop codon (`TGA`, `TAA`, or `CTA`).
```
Start codon "ATG" is followed by:
TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCG ACA ATG TGA CCT TCT GTG TGC TGG CTG CGG GTG AGG AGG ACG AGG GCG ACA TCG CGC TGC AGA TCC ATT TTA CGC TGA TCC AGG CTT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACA TCG ACA TAG TGC GCG TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CTA TCG TGG GCG CCG GCG AGG AGG CGG GTG CGC CGG GCG ACC TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA ACG AGG ACG CCT GGA AGG ATC CCG CCT TGG AGA AGC TCA GCC TGT TTT GCG AGG AGA GCC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA CCC TCC CCG AGT GA
```

#### Translate the sequence step-by-step:
1. `ATG` (Start codon → Met).
2. `TAC` → Tyr (Y)
3. `CCA` → Pro (P)
4. `TAC` → Tyr (Y)
5. `GAT` → Asp (D)
6. `GTT` → Val (V)
7. `CCA` → Pro (P)
8. `GAT` → Asp (D)
9. `TAC` → Tyr (Y)
10. `GCC` → Ala (A)
11. `AAA` → Lys (K)
12. `TGA` → Stop codon (This means that the translation stops here)

However, the part until the first stop codon (TGA) encodes:
`MY*PYDVPDYA*` where `*` signifies stop codon. 

But what we need here is:
1. The HA tag should directly follow the `ATG` start codon such that `ATG` codes for the initial methionine (which is usually cleaved if the next residues encode a signal peptide, but otherwise, the first residue is always Methionine until post-translational modifications).
2. HA tag should be placed directly after the start codon such that the start codon `ATG` still encodes the first Methionine.

Thus, upon our theoretical part here, the `ATG` encodes the first Met, which should be followed by the HA tag sequence. Usually, the completed amino acid sequence should thus be `M` followed by `YPYDVPDYA`. Hence:
$$
\text{(start codon)ATG} + \text{(HA tag)TACCCTATGACGTTCCGGATTACGC} + \text{(rest of GADD45G sequence)}
$$
However, what we need specifically should be:
$$
\text{ATG} + \text{(codons for HA:TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC)} + \text{(rest of GADD45G gene)}
$$
But the given part seems like `ATG[TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC (GCC AAA TGA)]`. The part inside brackets `[ ]` is what seems to be the part after `ATG`. 

However, we need to verify where the first stop codon appears:
$$
5' ATG[TAC CCA TACGATGTTCCAGATTAC]GCC[AAA]TGA => stop codon appears very early.
$$
It seems that `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC` encodes `YPYDVPDY`, which is almost the full HA tag except that it should be followed by `A` instead of `GCC AAA` followed by `TGA` (which is a stop codon).

Based on the HA tag sequence `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT`, the part `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC` encodes `Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr`, while `GCT` encodes `Ala` for the last amino acid `A` (`Ala`) in `YPYDVPDYA`.

However, here `TAC CCA TACGATGTTCCA GATTAC` corresponds to `YPYDVPDY` (need one more `A` codon instead of `GCC AAA [TGA]`).

However, upon closer observation, the HA tag sequence should ideally be encoded by `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTG CCA GAT TAC GCC` where `GCC` which codes for `Ala` seems valid except that `GCC` here is followed by `AAA` which encodes Lysine (K). However, the actual issue seems to be what follows `GCC` should normally be further protein sequence until another stop codon appears. Here, `AAA` is followed by a `TGA` stop codon:
```
ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCCAAA TGA...
M Y P Y D V P D Y A K stop...
```

Thus, any reading frame that reads `TGA` stops coding for protein, which seems to be the main issue here. The question statement mentions that you are unable to overexpress your protein. The issue seems to be that there appears a premature stop codon `TGA` within the part right after the HA tag sequence insertion.

Hence, the main reason why you are unable to overexpress your protein might be due to an early stop codon which truncates your protein. The truncated sequence thus might be:
Met-Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A-K-(Stop)

However verification here should confirm that the stop codon appears very early in the sequence where `TGA` appears just after `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA` which translates to:
Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala-Lys-Stop

However, the problem might be due to an erroneous part of DNA sequence where an unexpected stop codon appears only a few codons after the start codon `ATG`.

Based on our reasoning here, it seems that what you need should be `ATG` (which initiates translation and encodes for Methionine), immediately followed by the codons for the HA tag (which should ideally be `TAT CCA TAT GAT GTC CCA GAT TAC GCT`, yet your sequence roughly follows `TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC`) which should be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence until a stop codon appears only after the full GADD45G coding sequence has been translated.

However, upon analyzing further strands in the given sequence split into readable codons until the stop codon (excluding the first ATG):
1. `TAC` (Tyr)
2. `CCA` (Pro)
3. `TAC` (Tyr)
4. `GAT` (Asp)
5. `GTT` (Val)
6. `CCA` (Pro)
7. `GAT` (Tyr)
8. `TAC` (Asp)
9. `GCC` (Ala)
10. `AAA` (Lys)

But following `AAA` there is a premature stop codon `TGA`. Hence, the issue seems to be that there is no complete HA tag because the stop codon truncates the sequence prematurely right after what should be the HA tag.

However, the third line of the question statement mentions that one should "modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza HA antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein." Thus, the `ATG` should be part of what is already part of the native GADD45G gene coding sequence (which is a mistake here because `ATG` should be the standard initiation codon), so what should be added specifically is the `TAC CCA TAT GAT GTG CCA GAT TAC GCA` part which encodes `YPYDVPDYA`.

To properly identify where the stop codon appears in the given sequence, one needs to make sure that the HA tag is fully encoded within `ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGA...`, which ends at `TAC GCC AAA TGA`, making it 9 amino acids after the start Methionine and a stop codon appears directly after that (`TGA`).

Thus, our conclusion is that there appears an early stop codon `TGA` which results in a truncated protein expression instead of full length GADD45G expression fused with the HA tag. 

The proposed DNA sequence seems to have an incorrect part where `AAA` acts as a codon for lysine which is followed by a premature stop codon `TGA`. 

The most probable mistake here is when the HA tag should be cleanly inserted right after the `ATG` start codon such that `ATG` encodes the initiator methionine followed by HA tag (without any stop codon until after the complete GADD45G coding sequence should occur). 

Another error seems to be that the last codon should be `GCT` or `GCA` for alanine ("A" in YPYDVPDYA) instead of `GCC`, although `GCC` indeed codes for alanine. However, `GCC` is followed by `AAA` (which codes for lysine) and `TGA` stop codon which is a problem here.

#### Conclusion:
The probable error might be that the part including `GCC AAA TGA` should instead be extended such that after `GCC` (which codes for Ala), the GADD45G coding sequence should continue without any premature stop codons until the normal stop codon you expected at the end of the full GADD45G coding sequence itself.

Thus, what needs to be done is to verify that `TGA` appears only once at the end of the full GADD45G coding sequence and not right after the part intended to encode the HA tag. 

Hence, what seems wrong here appears to be that early stop codon `TGA` which makes the protein very short (having only about 10 amino acids including the HA tag until the stop codon appears).

Thus, you well understand that the premature stop codon caused the protein to be truncated and thus not fully expressed correctly as planned.
