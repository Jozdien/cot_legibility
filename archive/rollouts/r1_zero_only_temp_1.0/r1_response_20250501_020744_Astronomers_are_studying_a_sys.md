# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?

To solve for the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2, given that the orbital periods are in the ratio of $1:2:2.5:3.5:5$, we need to recall that the orbital periods $T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4,$, and $T_5$ for Planet_1 through Planet_5 are described by the given ratio such that:

$$
T_1 : T_2 : T_3 : T_4 : T_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.
$$

This implies that if there is a constant $k$ such that $T_1 = k$, $T_2 = 2k$, $T_3 = 2.5k$, $T_4 = 3.5k$, and $T_5 = 5k$. However, we need only compare $T_4$ and $T_2$ explicitly here. 

The question asks us to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The well-known formula for the equilibrium temperature $T_e$ of a planet (assuming that the planet is a black body in thermal equilibrium and that it absorbs all incoming stellar radiation and emits as a black body):
$$
T_e = \left(\frac{(1 - A) L_{\star}}{16\pi \sigma d^2}\right)^{1/4}.
$$
However, a simplified and commonly used form of the formula for the equilibrium temperature is derived from the balance between the incoming solar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation:
$$
T_e = T_{\star} \left(\frac{R_{\star}}{2d}\right)^{1/2} (1 - A)^{1/4},
$$
where $ T_{\star} $ is the effective temperature of the star, $ R_{\star} $ is the radius of the star, $d$ is the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit, and $A$ is the albedo (reflectivity) of the planet (which is given to be the same for both planets). 

However, a more commonly used form which makes it more explicit might be:
$$
T_e = \left(\frac{F(1 - A)}{4\sigma}\right)^{1/4},
$$
where $F$ is the flux received from the star which is proportional to the stellar luminosity $L_{\star}$ divided by the square of the distance $d$ from the star:
$$
F = \frac{L_{\star}}{4\pi d^2},
$$
so that:
$$
T_e = \left(\frac{L_{\star}(1 - A)}{16\pi \sigma d^2}\right)^{1/4}.
$$
Here $L_{\star}$ is the luminosity of the star (assuming the same star for all five planets).

However, another variant of the same formula could be written more explicitly for two specific planets such as Planet_4 $(d_4, T_{e4})$ and Planet_2 $(d_2, T_{e2})$. For Planet_2:
$$
T_{e2} = \left(\frac{L_{\star}(1 - A_2)}{16\pi \sigma d_2^2}\right)^{1/4}.
$$
For Planet_4:
$$
T_{e4} = \left(\frac{L_{\star(1 - A_4)}}{16\pi \sigma d_4^2}\right)^{1/4}.
$$
Hence the ratio of $T_{e4}$ to $T_{e2}$ is:
$$
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{\frac{L_{\star}(1 - A_4)}{16\pi \sigma d_4^2}}{\frac{L_{\star}(1 - A_2)}{16\pi \sigma d_2^2}}\right)^{1/4} = \left(\frac{(1 - A_4) d_2^2}{(1 - A_2) d_4^2}\right)^{1/4}.
$$
Since the question states that the albedo $A$ is the same for both Planet_4 and Planet_2 (i.e., $A_4 = A_2 = A$), the ratio simplifies to:
$$
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{(1 - A) d_2^2}{(1 - A) d_4^2}\right)^{1/4} = \left(\frac{d_2^2}{d_4^2}\right)^{1/4} = \left(\frac{d_2}{d_4}\right)^{2\times\frac{1/4}} = \left(\frac{d_2}{d_4}\right)^{1/2}.
$$
So, what we need now is a ratio of the distances (semi-major axes) $d_4$ and $d_2$ from the central star of Planets 4 and 2. 

To find out the relationship between the orbital periods and the semi-major axes, we need to invoke Kepler's Third Law, which states that:
$$
T^2 \propto d^3,
$$
or written explicitly:
$$
\frac{T_1^2}{T_2^2} = \frac{d_1^3}{d_2^3} \Rightarrow T \propto d^\frac{3}{2} \quad \text{(or } d \propto T^\frac{2}{3}).
$$
Using $T_4$ and $T_2$:
$$
\frac{T_4^2}{T_2^2} = \frac{d_4^3}{d_2^3} \Rightarrow d_2 \propto T_2^{\frac{2}{3}} \text{ and } d_4 \propto T_4^{\frac{2}{3}}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\frac{d_4}{d_2} = \left(\frac{T_4}{T_2}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}.
$$
We already know from the given orbital period ratios ($T_1 : T_2 : T_3 : T_4 : T_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5$), so:
$$
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \frac{3.5}{2} = \frac{7}{4}.
$$
Thus, substituting in the Kepler’s Third Law relation:
$$
\frac{d_4}{d_2} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}.
$$
However, we need the ratio $\frac{d_2}{d_4}$ for the equilibrium temperature ratio derivation:
$$
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{d_2}{d_4}\right)^{1/2}.
$$
Since $\frac{d_4}{d_2} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}$, it follows that:
$$
\frac{d_2}{d_4} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{-\frac{2}{3}} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{-\frac{2}{3}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}.
$$
Hence:
$$
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{d_2}{d_4}\right)^{1/2} = \left(\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)^{1/2} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{1}{2}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.
$$
Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 to that of Planet_2 is:
$$
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx \left(0.5714\right)^{0.3333} \approx (0.5714)^{0.3333} \approx 0.829,
$$
which is roughly equal to:
$$
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.82948.
$$

However conventionally, we need to express the ratio in fraction form or make sure it makes sense as such. 

#### Double-checking the math and making sure everything makes sense in a fraction form:
$$
\text{Ratio of equilibrium temperatures is thus} \frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
$$
We need to provide a final answer explicitly as a fraction powered to one-third:
$$
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{-\frac{1}{3}}.
$$
Another way to visualize it might be:
$$
\frac{(7/4)^{2/3}}{(d_2/d_4)^{1/2}}.
$$
However, as verification, it makes sense also to check another part of the reasoning here. Another common expression might be:
$$
T \sim \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{d}} T_{\star}.
$$
This makes another simple relation:
$$
T_e \propto d^{-1/2}.
$$
which seems a bit different from the $T_e \propto d^{-1/2}$ part of the derivation here thus far. However, the $T_e$ formula should be verified explicitly from another well-known source such as:
$$
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{eff}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2a}},
$$
where $T_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective temperature of the stellar body emitting radiation and $R_{\star}$ is the stellar radius while $a$ is the semi-major axis of the planet’s orbit around the star. Thus indeed:
$$
T_e \propto a^{-1/2}.
$$
However, the main part here involves the stellar parameters such as $T_{\text{eff}}$ and $R_{\star}$ which remain constant for the same star. Since:
$$
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{eff}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\star}}{2}} \times a^{-1/2}.
$$
The question thus requires us to find the ratio of $T_{\text{eq}}$ for Planet_4 to Planet_2 so:
$$
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_4}\right)^{1/2}.
$$

Since Kepler’s Third Law $T^2 \propto a^3$, thus $a^3 \propto T^2$, thus $a \propto T^{2/3}$, so:
$$
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{T_4}{T_2}\right)^{2/3}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\frac{T_{\text{eq},4}}{T_{\text{eq},2}} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_4}\right)^{1/2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_4}\right)^{1/2} = \left(\frac{T_2^{2/3}}{T_4^{2/3}}\right)^{1/2} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_4}\right)^{1/3}.
$$
Thus substituting the given ratio $T_2 = 2k$ and $T_4 = 3.5k$ where $k$ is a constant (which only scales the ratio here so it cancels out):
$$
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_4}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2k}{3.5k}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}.
$$
Since $2/3.5 = 4/7$, the same result we derived previously:
$$
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
$$
Hence, the answer is:
$$\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \text{ (which could be equivalently expressed as $\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}$ or approximately $0.83$.)}
$$
Let us explicitly verify what the "opposite" ratio looks like:
$$
\left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{-1/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}.
$$
Thus, the answer is:
$$
\boxed{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}}.
$$

To make this answer a little more intuitive:
$$
(4/7) \approx 0.5714,
$$
and thus $(4/7)^{1/3} \approx 0.8295$. Another way round is:
$$
\frac{1}{(4/7)^{1/3}} \approx \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.2055,
$$
or:
$$
1 / 0.8295 \approx 1.2055.
$$

Therefore another way round for the answer could be:
$$
\left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{-1/3}.
$$
However, the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 over Planet_2 which is what we calculated as $\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}$ or approximately $0.83$.

You can verify your answer by making a sanity check that Planet_4 has a longer orbital period than Planet_2, thus should be farther away from the star (since $T^2 \propto a^3$); therefore, if $d_4 > d_2$, then $\frac{d_2}{d_4} < 1$. Since $T_{\text{eq}} \propto d^{-1/2}$, a greater distance should produce a lower equilibrium temperature:

Therefore, the ratio $T_{e4}/T_{e2} < 1$ makes sense because $d_4 > d_2$ implies that $T_{e4}$ should be lower than $T_{e2}$, but the actual question is what the ratio between $T_{e4}$ and $T_{e2}$ is.

Answer verifies correctly that the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 should be lower compared to that of Planet_2 because it is farther from the star (since $d_4 > d_2$, thus $T_{e4} < T_{e2}$, making a ratio less than 1 reasonable).

To summarize:
The reasoning makes sense so far where the ratio of the surface equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 to Planet_2 is:
$$
\boxed{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}}.
$$

This is a well-reasoned and verified answer.
