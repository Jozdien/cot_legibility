To solve for the unknown organic compound based on the given 1H NMR data, let us first interpret the provided information:

The given 1H NMR data is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

This data describes four distinct proton environments (signals), with specific multiplicities and coupling constants:
1. "7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)": This triplet has a coupling constant of 16.0 Hz and integrates to one hydrogen atom (1H).
2. "5.5 ppm (1H, dq)": A doublet of quartets (dq) which integrates to one hydrogen atom (1H).
3. "2.1 ppm (3H, s)": A singlet (s) which integrates three hydrogen atoms (3H).
4. "1.6 ppm (3H, d)": A doublet (d) which integrates to three hydrogen atoms (3H).

#### Interpretation of the coupling constant "J = 16.0 Hz" for a proton appearing at 7.0 ppm as a doublet (d):

Such a coupling constant is typically associated with trans coupling across a double bond (allylic coupling constants). For protons on a carbon-carbon double bond, a coupling constant around 16 Hz is indicative of a trans configuration (antiperiplanar protons), whereas a cis configuration usually has a coupling constant around 10 Hz.

#### Given the candidate compounds are:
1. Cis-propenyl acetate
2. Trans-propenyl acetate
3. Cis-butenyl acetate
4. Trans-butenyl acetate

Let us draw the structures for these compounds and analyze their expected 1H NMR signals.

### Cis-propenyl acetate (Structure: CH₃C(O)OCH=CHCH₃ where CH₃ and H are cis to each other on the double bond):
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-C(O)-O-CH=CH-CH_3} \text{ (cis)}
$$
Depending on the orientation (cis means that the larger groups are on the same side of the double bond).

### Trans-propenyl acetate (Structure: CH₃C(O)OCH=CHCH₃ where CH₃ and H are trans to each other on the double bond):
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-C(O)-O-CH=CH-CH_3} \text{ (trans)}
$$
In trans, the larger groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

### Cis-butenyl acetate (Structure: CH₃C(O)OCH₂CH=CHCH₃ where CH₃ and H are cis to each other on the double bond):
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-C(O)-O-CH_2-CH=CH-CH_3} \text{ (cis)}
$$
Here there is a $CH_2$ group between the acetate part ($CH_3-C(O)-O-$) and the double bond.

### Trans-butenyl acetate (Structure: CH₃C(O)OCH₂CH=CHCH₃ where CH₃ and H are trans to each other on the double bond):
$$
\mathrm{CH_3-C(O)-O-CH_2-CH=CH-CH_3} \text{ (trans)}
$$

#### To identify the unknown organic compound, we need to identify specific proton NMR resonance peaks for each candidate compound. 

Let us label the protons for the most likely candidates (cis/trans propenyl acetate where there is only one carbon connecting the vinyl part to the acetate part):

For cis/trans "propenyl acetate" (CH₃C(O)OCH=CHCH₃) structures, the structure breaks into:
1. CH₃CO group (acetate part where the CH₃ resonates typically around 2.1 ppm).
2. OCH=CHCH₃ part where:
    - Protons on the double bond should appear typically around 5.5 to 6.5 ppm for most vinyl protons.
    - The methyl group attached to the carbon next to the double bond should appear typically around 1.7 ppm.

Similarly, for cis/trans "butenyl acetate" (CH₃C(O)OCH₂–CH=CHCH₃) structures, structure breaks into:
1. CH₃C(O) group (typically the CH₃ group appears around 2.1 ppm).
2. OCH₂-CH=CH-CH₃ part where:
    - Protons on the double bond should appear typically between 5.5 to 6.5 ppm for most vinyl protons.
    - The methyl group attached to the carbon next to the double bond should appear typically around 1.7 ppm.
    - The CH₂ group should appear somewhere around 4.0 ppm (since it's next to an oxygen atom which deshields the protons).

#### Step-by-step reasoning for a propenyl acetate structure such as $\mathrm{CH_3COOCH=CHCH_3}$:
1. The peak at $\delta$ 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) could be one of the protons on the double bond (CH=CH part). The only other candidate would be the CH₃CO protons which typically appear around 2.2 ppm (usually a singlet).
2. The peak at $\delta$ 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) should be the other proton on the double bond (CH=⟨\text{H}_{dq}\text{⟩ CH part) where the dq pattern ("doublet of quartets") results from coupling with the neighboring vinyl proton and the methyl group.
3. The peak at $\delta$ 2.1 ppm (3H, s) matches the CH₃CO group which typically appears as a singlet because there are no neighboring protons that couple to these three equivalent methyl protons except for a minor coupling with the carbonyl carbon.
4. The peak at $\delta$ 1.6 ppm (3H, d) should be the CH₃ group attached to the double bond (CH=CH–CH₃). The "d" indicates it couples to only one neighboring proton in this case, which is the proton bonded to the same carbon as the CH₃ is attached (vinyl proton).

Based on the first signal (7.0 ppm, doublet, J = 16.0 Hz), this strongly suggests a trans configuration for the propenyl part because a trans coupling constant in a double bond is typically larger (around 14-18 Hz) while a cis coupling constant is typically smaller (around 6-12 Hz). 

For propenyl acetate (CH₃C(O)OCH=CHCH₃):
1. The proton closer to the oxygen (vinyl proton directly attached to the ester oxygen moiety) should typically resonate at a somewhat lower field compared to the other vinyl protons. However, the other proton resonance description fits well for a doublet coupled at 16 Hz representative of a trans double bond. Thus, we need to identify:
    - For trans-propenyl acetate (also called "trans-1-propenyl acetate"):    
      - The two vinyl protons are non-equivalent (CH₃C(O) – O-C**H**=C**H**–CH₃). One proton is closer to the ester group (which might be the hydrogen that appears at 7.0 ppm if it is trans to the hydrogen on the other carbon of the double bond).
    
#### Splitting patterns:
For trans-propenyl acetate:
1. The peak at 7.0 ppm should be the proton on the double bond that is trans to the other vinyl proton (which is the proton on the carbon directly bonded to the ester linkage CH₃C(O)OCH=CHCH₃). The "d" indicates it couples only to one neighboring vinyl proton (with a coupling constant of 16.0 Hz).
2. The peak at 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) should be the proton interacting with both the methyl group (which gives a quartet splitting component due to the -CH₃) and the other vinyl proton (which gives a doublet splitting component).
3. The singlet (3H, s) at 2.1 ppm matches the acetate methyl group (CH₃C(O)).
4. The doublet (3H, d) at 1.6 ppm fits well with the methyl group CH₃ attached to the double bond (CH=CHCH₃), which has coupling only to the adjacent vinyl proton (typically observed as a doublet).

Based on this reasoning, the unknown compound is most likely **Trans-propenyl acetate**.

#### Verification:
For more robust verification, one could check what the 1H NMR spectrum should look like for trans-propenyl acetate (structure: CH₃C(O)OCH=CHCH₃, where the vinyl protons are in a trans configuration).
1. The ester group CH₃ should show a singlet peak around 2.1 ppm.
2. The vinyl proton connected to the carbon which is also connected to the oxygen (i.e., CH₃C(O) O-C**H**=CH-CH₃) should be coupled strongly (for trans-configuration) and should appear at a lower field (e.g., 7.0 ppm).
3. The vinyl proton connected to the methyl group (i.e., CH₃C(O)O-CH=**C**H-CH₃) should appear typically at a slightly lower field than aliphatic protons because it is on a double bond (5.5 ppm makes sense here). This should be a doublet of quartets (coupling both to the other vinyl proton and to the three protons of the adjacent methyl group.

Based on the structure of butenyl acetate (CH₃C(O)OCH₂-CH=CHCH₃), one should see an extra signal for the oxygen-bound CH₂ group appearing typically at around 4.0–4.5 ppm due to the adjacent oxygen atom. However, such a signal is not mentioned in your question.

Thus, the reasoning leads us to conclude that the unknown compound should be:
**Trans-propenyl acetate.**

Verifying cis vs. trans configurations through NMR coupling constants is a well-established technique where trans couplings are usually at higher Hz values compared to cis couplings. 

Thus, based on our interpretation and reasoning, the compound appears to be:
Trans-propenyl acetate.
