To solve for which exoplanet has the highest density among the given options, let us recall that the density \(\rho\) of a planet is given by:
\[\rho = \frac{M}{V},\]
where \(M\) is the mass of the planet and \(V\) is the volume of the planet. The volume of a roughly spherical planet can be approximated as:
\[V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3,\]
where \(R\) is the radius of the planet.

#### Option A: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
The Earth has a mass \(M_E\) (approximately \(5.972 \times 10^{24}\) kg) and a radius \(R_E\) (approximately \(6371\) km or \(6.371 \times 10^6\) m).
The density of Earth can be computed as follows:
\[\rho_E = \frac{M_E}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_E^3}.\]
This is a well-known typical value for Earth's average density, which is approximately \(5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3\).

#### Option B: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately \(5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3\)".
This option states explicitly that the planet has a density of approximately \(5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3\), presumably based on the given mass (which is twice the Earth's mass) and whatever radius it might have such that \(\rho \approx 5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3\):
\[\rho_B = 5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3.\]

#### Option C: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth.
If a planet has the same "composition" as Earth but is 5 times more massive (\(M' = 5M_E\)), what would be its density compared to Earth's density given that the planet's composition is the same? 

To explore what "same composition" might imply for density, we need to make some approximations based on the fact that both planets have the same composition. However, the phrasing "5 times more massive than Earth" means that if the planet has a mass \(M_C = 5M_E\), we need to infer how the radius would compare for a planet with Earth-like composition that is 5 times more massive than Earth.

It is a well-studied fact that for terrestrial ("rocky") planets, for planets with increasing mass (until such a point where internal pressures become so high that the material becomes compressed beyond usual states), the average density tends to increase because the additional gravitational force compresses the material within the planet. However, a more generalized mass-radius relation for rocky planets is given roughly by \( R \propto M^{1/4}\) for a fixed composition where volume \(V \propto R^3\), so \(V \propto M^{3/4}\), thus:
\[\rho = \frac{M}{V} \propto \frac{M}{M^{3/4}} = M^{1/4}.\]
However, a more modern and sophisticated mass-radius relationship for rocky planets (such as those made primarily of silicates and iron) indicates that once the mass becomes significantly greater than Earth's, the increase in radius is typically less than proportional to the cube root of the mass because of compression effects which make the material denser. Nonetheless, it should be validated explicitly what happens to density when the mass increases while maintaining the same composition.

However, a standard mass-radius relationship widely used for rocky planets (Earth-like composition) is:
$$
R \propto M^{0.27} \text{if } M < M_{\oplus} \text{(where composition stays roughly constant)}
$$
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{ \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3} \propto \frac{M}{ (M^{0.27})^3} \approx \frac{M}{M^{0.81}} = M^{0.19}.
$$
This indicates that if a planet's mass increases while keeping the same composition, the density should actually slightly increase. However, another well-known approximation states that for a purely rocky composition planet up to several times the Earth's mass, the relation suggests that:
$$
R = R_E \left(\frac{M}{M_E}\right)^{0.25} \text{ (approximately)}.
$$
So if this relation holds for a planet that has a mass \(5M_E\), the planet's radius would be:
$$
R = R_E \times 5^{0.25} \approx R_E \times 1.495.
$$
These relations make it possible to calculate the planet's new density:
$$\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{5M_E}{\frac{4}{3}\pi (1.495 R_E)^3} = \frac{5M_E}{\frac{4}{3}\pi \times 1.495^3 R_E^3}= \frac{5M_E}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_E^3 \times (1.495)^3} .
$$
We already know that:
$$
\rho_E = \frac{M_E}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_E^3}.
$$
So:
$$
\rho_C = \frac{5 M_E}{\frac{4}{3} \pi (1.495 R_E)^3} = \frac{5}{(1.495)^3} \cdot \frac{M_E}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_E^3} \approx \frac{5}{(1.495)^3} \cdot \rho_E.
$$
Calculating the term \(\frac{5}{(1.495)^3}\):
$$
(1.495)^3 \approx 3.342.
$$
So \(\frac{5}{(1.495)^3} \approx \frac{5}{3.342} \approx 1.496.
$$
Thus:
$$
\rho_C \approx 1.496 \rho_E.
$$
Since \(\rho_E \approx 5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3\):
$$
\rho_C \approx 1.496 \times 5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3} \approx 8.228 \text{ g/cm}^3.
$$

#### Option D: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.
Similarly, using the relation derived earlier such that \(R = R_E \left(\frac{M}{M_E}\right)^{0.25}\), for a planet that has a mass of \(0.5M_E\), its radius would be:
$$
R = R_E \times (0.5)^{0.25} \approx R_E \times 0.8409.
$$
Calculating the new density for this planet:
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{0.5 M_E}{\frac{4}{3}\pi (0.8409 R_E)^3} = \frac{0.5 M_E}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_E^3 \times (0.8409)^3}.
$$
And again using \(\rho_E = \frac{M_E}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_3^3}\):
$$
\rho_D = \frac{0.5}{(0.8409)^3} \cdot \frac{M_E}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_E^3} = \frac{0.5}{(0.8409)^3} \rho_E.
$$
Calculating the term \(\frac{0.5}{(0.8409)^3}\):
$$
(0.8409)^3 \approx 0.5947,
$$
So \(\frac{0.5}{(0.8409)^3} \approx \frac{0.5}{0.5947} \approx 0.8408.
$$
Thus:
$$
\rho_D \approx 0.8408 \times\rho_E.
$$
Again, since \(\rho_E \approx 5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3}\):
$$
\rho_D \approx 0.8408 \times 5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3} \approx 4.624 \text{ g/cm}^3.
$$

### Comparing the densities found:

- From option A (Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet), \(\rho_A = 5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3\).
- From option B (2 Earth masses with a density of \(5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3\)), \(\rho_B = 5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3\).
- From option C (same composition as Earth, but 5 times more massive), \(\rho_C \approx 8.229 \text{ g/cm}^3\).
- From option D (same composition as Earth, but half the mass), \(\rho_D ≈ 4.624 \text{ g/cm}^3\).

Based on our reasoning here, it appears option C (a planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth) has the highest density among the given options because the relation shows that for rocky planets with the same composition, a more massive planet should have a higher average density due to gravitational self-compression. 

Note that typically larger rocky planets are more dense due to an increase in pressure which causes the interior material to compress, thereby increasing density until a point where the internal pressure causes a phase transition or until the planet's composition itself starts to change significantly which does not need to be considered here explicitly based on description given.

Thus:
Answer: c.
Hence, among the given choices, the planet described in option C should have the highest density.
However, let us verify once again:

### Another approach to sanity check:
Typically, the relation \(R \propto M^{0.3}\) might be another simpler approximate description until compressibility significantly alters the mass-radius relation such that:
$$
V \propto M^{0.9}.
$$
which makes:
$$
\rho = \frac{M}{V} \propto M^{0.1}.
$$
However, the equation \( \rho \propto M^{0.1} \) indicates that for a larger mass planet with the same composition, the bigger planet should indeed be slightly higher in density.

However, another key observation given here is that an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet has a density of \(5.5 \text{ g/cm}^3\), while a planet twice as massive as Earth mentioned in option B hints that its density is still \(5.5 \text{ g/cm^3}\). However, what if such a comment should be verified explicitly through a similar radius-mass relation. 

However, one might interpret option B as a trick question given that a planet with twice the mass of Earth but also specifically having a "density of approximately \(5.5\text{ g/cm}^3\)" is equal to Earth's given density; thus no need to make assumptions here for option B.

Given all this reasoning, the answer should be verified explicitly:
Based purely on the provided calculations and known mass-radius relations for rocky planets with Earth-like composition (where a higher mass usually yields a higher density), answer choice C (a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive than Earth) appears to be the one with the highest density.
However, what if option B is interpreted correctly that the planet has a mass twice that of Earth and yet has a defined density of 5.5 g/cm^3 (which is equal to Earth’s density given in option A). 

Thus, while the question is trying to make us realize that a denser planet would be one that is more massive yet maintains the same composition until gravitational compression makes a significant impact on the planet's size such that its overall density increases compared to a similarly composed but less massive planet.

Based on the "same composition but 5 times Earth mass" situation, such a planet should have a higher internal pressure and thus a higher average density compared to a planet that is less massive such as half Earth's mass.

Hence, option C appears to be the most logical answer based on the reasoning steps.
