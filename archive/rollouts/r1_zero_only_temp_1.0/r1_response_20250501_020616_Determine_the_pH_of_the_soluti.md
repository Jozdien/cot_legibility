To solve for the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, we need first to find out the total volume of the resulting solution and the moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2) initially present in individual solutions.

First, let us calculate the total volume:
$$
V_{\text{total}} = 500\ \text{mL} + 400\ \text{mL} + 300\ \text{mL} = 1200\ \text{mL} = 1.2\ \text{L}
$$

#### Initial Moles of CH3COOH:
$$
\text{Moles of CH3COOH} = \text{Volume (liters)} \times \text{Molarity} = 0.5\ \text{L} \times 0.1\ \text{M} = 0.05\ \text{moles}
$$
(Note: 500 mL is converted to 0.5 L).

#### Initial Moles of HCl:
$$
\text{Moles of HCl} = 0.4\ \text{L} \times 0.2\ \text{M} = 0.08\ \text{moles}
$$
(Note: 400 mL is converted to 0.4 L).

#### Initial Moles of Ba(OH)2:
$$
\text{Moles of Ba(OH)2} = 0.3\ \text{L} \times 0.3\ \text{M} = 0.09\ \text{moles}
$$
(Note: 300 mL is converted to 0.3 L).

Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba2+ and 2 OH- ions:
$$
\text{Ba(OH)2} \rightarrow \text{Ba}^{2+} + 2 \text{OH}^-
$$
Thus, for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get two moles of OH⁻ ions. Therefore:
$$
\text{Moles of OH⁻} = 2 \times 0.09\ \text{moles} = 0.18\ \text{moles}
$$

#### Initial Moles of H⁺ from HCl and CH3COOH:

For HCl, which is a strong acid that dissociates completely:
$$
\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{Cl}^-
$$
Thus, moles of H⁺ from HCl will be equal to moles of HCl:
$$
\text{Moles of H⁺ (from HCl)} = 0.08\ \text{moles}
$$

For CH3COOH, which is a weak acid that only partially dissociates:
$$
\text{CH$_3$COOH} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH$_3$COO}^- + \text{H}^+
$$
However, it is important to first check how CH3COOH reacts once mixed with a strong acid (HCl) and a strong base (Ba(OH)2). Since Ba(OH)2 releases OH⁻ ions, which will first react with the H⁺ ions from HCl because HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely:
$$
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$
However, in this case, what we need to do is to check the reaction between the total H⁺ ions available initially (mainly from HCl because HCl is a strong acid and CH3COOH is a weak acid and thus does not dissociate completely initially) and the OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)2. Another important point here is that strong acids like HCl will provide H⁺ ions which react first with the OH⁻ ions provided by Ba(OH)2. 

#### Net Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:

Total moles of H⁺ ions from HCl is 0.08 moles (CH3COOH is a weak acid so initially, most of its H⁺ ions remain bound until reactions occur).

Total moles of OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. 

The reaction thus proceeds as follows:
$$
\text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$
The stoichiometry is 1:1 for H⁺ and OH⁻. Thus, we need to find out what remains after reaction:
1) First, the reaction should consume the H⁺ from HCl first because it is already dissociated completely.
2) Once HCl's H⁺ is consumed, any remaining OH⁻ will react with the CH3COOH. 

First, let us figure out how much OH⁻ reacts with the H⁺ from HCl:
$$
0.08\ \text{moles H}^+ + 0.08\ \text{moles OH}^- \rightarrow 0.08\ \text{moles H$_2$O}
$$

After reacting with the 0.08 moles of H⁺ from HCl, the remaining OH⁻ will be:
$$
0.18\text{ moles OH}^- - 0.08 \text{ moles OH}^- = 0.10\text{ moles OH}^-
$$
(This means that the 0.08 moles of HCl has been completely neutralized.)

The reaction between OH⁻ and CH3COOH (assuming that OH⁻ reacts directly with CH3COOH rather than waiting for it to dissociate) is:
$$
\text{CH3COOH} + \text{OH}^- \rightarrow \text{CH3COO}^- + \text{H2O}
$$
This reaction occurs because the OH⁻ directly removes a proton from CH3COOH to form water and acetate ion (CH3COO⁻).

The remaining OH⁻ is 0.10 moles and the initial moles of CH3COOH present are 0.05 moles. Since OH⁻ reacts with CH3COOH in a 1:1 stoichiometry, let us consume CH3COOH until one of the reactants is completely used:
$$
0.05\ \text{moles of CH3COOH} + 0.05\ \text{moles OH}^- \rightarrow 0.05\ \text{moles CH3COO}^- + \text{H$_2$O}
$$
This reaction consumes another 0.05 moles of the remaining 0.10 moles of OH⁻:
$$
0.10\text{ moles OH}^- - 0.05\ \text{moles OH}^- = 0.05\ \text{moles OH}^- \text{ remaining}
$$
Meanwhile, all of the CH3COOH (0.05 moles) has been converted to 0.05 moles of CH3COO⁻ and H2O.

#### What Remains After These Reactions:
1. CH3COOH is completely neutralized because there was an excess of OH⁻.
2. We need to find out what substances are present in the final solution:
    
    After reaction:
    - Moles of remaining OH⁻ = 0.05 moles
    - Moles of CH3COO⁻ = 0.05 moles
    - Moles of Ba²⁺ ions remain what was initially there for Ba(OH)2, which is 0.09 moles (however, Ba²⁺ does not directly affect pH).
    - Cl⁻ remains what was initially there from HCl, which is 0.08 moles (again, Cl⁻ does not directly affect pH).

#### To find the resulting pH, we need only the remaining OH⁻ concentration since all acidic components (HCl and CH3COOH) have been neutralized (with some OH⁻ in excess):
\[
[\text{OH}^-]_{\text{remaining}} = \frac{0.05\ \text{moles of OH}^-}{1.2\ \text{L}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \text{ M} \approx 0.04167\ \text{M}
\]
To find the pOH:
$$
\text{pOH} = -\log_{10}(0.04167) \approx -\log_{10}(4.167 \times 10^{-2})
$$
$$
\text{pOH} = -(\log_{10}(4.167) + \log_{10}(10^{-2}))
$$
$$
\log_{10}(4.167) \approx \log_{10}(4) \approx 0.6
$$
$$
\log_{10}(10^{-2}) = -2
$$
$$
\text{pOH} = -(0.6 - 2) = -0.6 + 2 = 1.4
$$
(Alternatively, if you use a calculator:)
$$
\log_{10}(0.04167) \approx -1.3802
$$
$$
\text{pOH} = -(-1.3802) \approx 1.3802
$$

To find the pH:
$$
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH}
$$
$$
\text{pH} \approx 14 - 1.3802 = 12.6198
$$
(rounding to a reasonable number of significant figures based on the problem statement which uses a couple decimal places, round to approximately two decimal places might make sense)
$$
\text{pH} \approx 12.62
$$

However, once again, double-checking the part where it mentions CH3COO⁻ formed might need a bit of double verification for any hydrolysis effect. Which might make us wonder if the CH3COO⁻ formed could change the acidity of the solution due hydrolysis reaction:
$$
\text{CH3COO}^- + \text{H2O} \rightarrow \text{CH3COOH} + \text{OH}^- 
$$
However, in this case, since there is already an excess of strong base (OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)2), the small contribution of additional OH⁻ ions from the hydrolysis of CH3COO⁻ is usually negligible compared to a significant remaining OH⁻ concentration of 0.05 moles in a 1.2 L solution (i.e., our OH⁻ concentration from the hydrolysis would be much smaller compared to the initial excess OH⁻ concentration left after reaction with acids).

However, let us explicitly check the OH⁻ from CH3COO⁻ hydrolysis:
1. Initial concentration of CH3COO⁻ formed:
$$
[\text{CH3COO}^-] = \frac{0.05\ \text{moles}}{1.2\ \text{L}} \approx 0.04167\text{ M}
$$
2. For any acetate ion in water:
$$
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a}
$$
where $K_a$ for CH3COOH is roughly $1.8 \times 10^{-5}$ at 25°C (typically known constant for acetic acid).
$$
K_b = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.56 \times 10⁻^{10}
$$

The hydrolysis reaction thus is governed by the following equation:
$$
K_b = \frac{[\text{CH3COOH}][\text{OH}^-]}{[\text{CH3COO}^-]}
$$
$$
5.56 \times 10^{-10} = \frac{x \cdot x}{0.04167 - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.04167}
$$
(Since $K_b$ is so small, $0.04167 - x \approx 0.04167$.)
$$
5.56 \times 10^{-10} \times 0.04167 \approx x^2
$$
$$
x^2 = 2.31705 \times 10^{-11}
$$
$$
x \approx \sqrt{2.31705 \times 10^{-11}} 
$$
$$
x \approx 4.81 \times 10^{-6}
$$
The $x$ here represents the amount of additional OH⁻ generated from the hydrolysis of acetate ions. However, this extra OH⁻ contribution is negligible compared to the main excess of OH⁻ present (0.04167 M or 0.04167 mol/L). Thus, the main contributor to the pH is still the excess OH⁻ calculated earlier:
$$
[\text{OH}^-]_{\text{remaining}} + [\text{OH}^-]_{\text{hydrolysis}} = 0.04167 + 4.81 \times 10^{-6} \approx 0.04167
$$
The additional $4.81 \times 10^{-6}$ M is negligible compared to $0.04167$ M.

Thus, the main pH calculation should be driven by the remaining OH⁻ concentration which makes the solution basic. 

However, we need verification one more time that the process makes sense:
1) pH is calculated from the excess hydroxide ions which makes the pOH:
$$
\text{pOH} = -\log_{10}([\text{OH}^-]) \approx -\log_{10}(0.04167) \approx 1.38
$$
2) Therefore:
$$
\text{pH} = 14 - 1.38 \approx 12.62
$$

Hence our reasoning seems consistent and the resulting pH is approximately:
$$\boxed{12.62}$$

Therefore, the reasoning seems solid and the pH should be primarily determined by the excess OH⁻ from the reaction with Ba(OH)2.

#### Double-checking once again for H⁺ ions:
There should be no H⁺ ions remaining from the acid because both HCl and CH3COOH supplies of H⁺ (explicit from HCl and potential from CH3COOH) have been neutralized by OH⁻. Thus, the remaining OH⁻ makes the solution alkaline.

Thus, we need only verify that the OH⁻ makes sense here. An approximate round-off check could be:
1. Initially total moles of H⁺ supplied by acids are roughly:
    - $0.08\text{ (HCl)} + 0.05\text{ (CH3COOH contribution would initially be less due to weak acid nature, thus only part of $0.05\text{ moles}$ would dissociate if no OH⁻ were present (for pure acetic acid, only a small fraction would dissociate, typically given by the $K_a$ reaction, but here, it makes sense to directly react with OH⁻)})\\
Total H⁺ is considered $0.08 + \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is a small fraction derived from $0.05$ moles of CH3COOH. However, this needs to be compared against $0.18$ OH⁻ moles which means OH⁻ ions are in excess. 

Another round-check would be by finding the net moles of H⁺ versus OH⁺:
Total initial H⁺ moles approximately is $0.08 + (\text{some part of }0.05)$.
Total initial OH⁻ moles from Ba(OH)2 is $0.18$.

Since OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl first (strong acid), then reacts with CH3COOH until one reagent is used up. Thus, after $0.08$ OH⁻ moles react with $0.08$ moles HCl, the remaining $0.10$ moles ($0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10$) OH⁻ should react entirely with $0.05$ moles CH3COOH which leaves us $0.05$ moles OH⁻ extra.

So, everything looks correct so far. Thus, the most important part here is the balance of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions where the strong base (Ba(OH)2) is in excess after neutralizing both HCl and CH3COOH completely.
