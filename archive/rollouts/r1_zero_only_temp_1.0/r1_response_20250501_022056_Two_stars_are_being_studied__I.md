# Original Question

Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?

To tackle this question correctly, we need to make use of the Boltzmann distribution which characterizes the distribution of particles among different energy states in thermal equilibrium (LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium here). According to the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the number of particles in two different energy states $n_1$ and $n_2$ (with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ where $E_2 > E_1$) is given by:

$$\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1}e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}},$$
where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the statistical weights (degeneracies) for the energy states $E_1$ and $E_2$, respectively, $\Delta E = E_2 - E_1$ is the energy difference between states $E_2$ and $E_1$, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant (approximately $1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}$), and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

The question states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." This means that the ratio of the populations of excited states (let us denote $n_2^{(1)}$ for star_1 and $n_2^{(2)}$ for star_2) for a specific energy level (presumably a higher energy level $E_2$ compared to some lower energy level $E_1$) is such that:
$$
\frac{n_2^{(1)}}{n_1^{(1)}} = 2 \times \frac{n_2^{(2)}}{n_1^{(2)}},
$$
where $n^{(1)}$ and $n^{(2)}$ denote quantities for star_1 and star_2, respectively.

But what we need to solve for here should be determined from the given Boltzmann distribution. However, there seems to be a little bit of a discrepancy here because what the question means by "twice as excited" might need a little bit of clarification. But interpreting "twice as excited" means that the relative population of a higher energy state compared to a lower energy state (which is what "excitation" typically refers to) is twice that in star_2.

So, let us write the Boltzmann distribution for star_1's iron atoms where the energy levels have populations $n_1^{(1)}$ and $n_2^{(1)}$:
$$\frac{n_2^{(1)}}{n_1^{(1)}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1}e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}}.$$

Similarly, for star_2's iron atoms where the energy levels have populations $n_1^{(2)}$ and $n_2^{(2)}$:
$$\frac{n_2^{(2)}}{n_1^{(2)}} = \frac{g_2}{g_1}e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}}.$$

Using the given information that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are "twice as excited" in a specific energy level compared to the iron atoms in star_2, this statement translates mathematically to:
$$
\frac{n_2^{(1)}}{n_1^{(1)}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_2^{(2)}}{n_1^{(2)}}.
$$
Therefore, we substitute the Boltzmann distribution for each star into this relation:
$$
\frac{g_2}{g_1}e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{g_2}{g_1}e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}}.
$$
The statistical weight ratio $\frac{g_2}{g_1}$ cancels out on both sides:
$$
e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \cdot e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}}.
$$

This simplifies to:
$$
e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}} = 2,
$$
or:
$$
e^{\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2.
$$
Take the natural log on both sides:
$$
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln 2,
$$
which means:
$$
\Delta E \left(\frac{1}{k T_2} - \frac{1}{k T_1} \right) = \ln 2,
$$
or:
$$
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) = \ln 2.
$$
We are given that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is:
$$
\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J},
$$
and the Boltzmann constant $k$ is:
$$
k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J.K}^{-1}.
$$
Substitute those values into the previous equation:
$$
\frac{1.38 \times 10^{-23}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \left( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) = \ln 2,
$$
$$
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \right) = \ln 2.
$$
We need to solve for an equation that relates $T_1$ and $T_2$. Hence, solve for the inverse temperatures:
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} = \ln 2 + \frac{1}{T_1}.
$$
However, another way to write this is:
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2.
$$
Let us invert the terms to make it more intuitive:
$$
\left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = - \ln 2,
$$
which makes it clear that the answer should be:
$$
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = -\ln 2,
$$
which is the same as:
$$
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} - \ln 2.
$$
However, the standard form of the Boltzmann relation yields us one form which seems a bit ambiguous because expressing the relation explicitly keeps us in the form:
$$
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln 2.
$$

To make this reasoning a bit more explicit, let us recall $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the effective temperatures of star_1 and star_2. Given this, we need to interpret what this means for the relative temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$. 

From the equation:
$$
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln 2,
$$
since $\ln 2 \approx 0.693$ is positive, that means:
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} > \frac{1}{T_1}.
$$
Since the reciprocals should satisfy $ \frac{1}{T_2} > \frac{1}{T_1}$, it follows that:
$$
T_1 > T_2.
$$
However, we need to identify which of the given options represent our derived relation $\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln 2$. However, if any provided options need us to isolate $T_1$ explicitly, let us solve for $T_1$. Start again from our expression:
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2,
$$
$$
\frac{1}{T_8} - \ln 2 = \frac{1}{T_1}.
$$
$$
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1 - T_2 \ln 2}{T_2}.
$$
$$
T_1 = \frac{T_2}{1 - T_2 \ln 2}.
$$
This makes it explicit that $T_1$ should be a function of $T_2$. However, if any of the answers follow any of these derived relations, such as:
$$
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = -\ln 2,
$$
it should be verified as well. However, the question wants us to identify which of the given choices matches our reasoning. Thus, let us explicitly verify the reasoning process here again such that:
$$
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln 2,
$$

Thus, another way to check the question clearly is it seems like what we need can be answered here directly if the question proposes multiple choices such as:
1) $T_1 = \frac{T_2}{2}$,
2) $T_1 = 2\cdot T_2$,
3) $\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2$,
4) Some other mathematical relation.

However, from the derived relation we need:
$$
\frac{1}{T_1} + \ln 2 = \frac{1}{T_2}.
$$
However typically we need an equality relation directly comparing $T_1$ and $T_2$, so another way to solve could be:

$$
e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2 \times e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}}.
$$
This means:
$$
e^{\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}} = 2 \times e^{\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}}.
$$
However, the most valid algebraic manipulation should be:
$$
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} - \ln 2.
$$
However another valid form is:
$$
e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}} / e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}} = 2.
$$
$$
e^{\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}} = 2.
$$
Thus:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln 2.
$$
And given $\Delta E = k$ ($k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\, \text{J/K}$ and $\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\, \text{J}$):
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2.
$$

However, it seems the most accurate answer based on our reasoning should indeed be:
$$
\frac{1}{T_1} + \ln 2 = \frac{1}{T_2}.
$$
However, the actual relation should be:
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2.
$$
Thus another valid form should be:
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2,
\qquad\text{or}\qquad
\boxed{\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2}.
$$
However, this answer requires us to check which of the multiple-choice options corresponds to this relation. However, such choices should be given in the actual question statement. However, typically such choices might be:
$$
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \ln 2,
$$
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2,
$$
$$
T_2 - T_1 = \ln 2,
$$
$$
T_1 - T_2 = \ln 2.
$$

Based on our reasoning, the closest relation matches:
$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2}.
$$
Thus, the correct equation resulting from the reasoning should be:
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{T_1} + \ln 2.
$$

However, check out the choices which should be given explicitly in another part of the question might be verifying this reasoning. However, what we derived should be:
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2,
$$
which fits perfectly well into our derived expression.
Thus, any provided answer containing this format should be what we need to find.

Based on our analytical derivations, $T_1$ should be the higher temperature because if $1/T_2 - 1/T_1 > 0$, it implies $T_1 > T_2$. 

Another way to verify what needs to be true here might be:
$$
\frac{1}{T_1} + \ln 2 = \frac{1}{T_2}.
$$
So, star having a higher excitation (which means a larger value of the ratio $\frac{n_2}{n_1}$) should correspond to the star with a higher temperature. However, our current reasoning proves that star_1 with a larger excitation makes $T_1$ higher than $T_2$. Therefore, star_1 has iron atoms that are twice as "excited" as those in star_2 because $T_1$ should be higher than $T_2$.

So, if the question provides choices such as:
1. $T_1 = 2T_2$.
2. $T_2 = 2T_1$.
3. $\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \ln 2$.
4. $\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2$.

The answer should be:
$$
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln 2.
$$
Based on the identification of the reasoning above, verifying against given options should make this choice the only valid one.
