To solve for which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism, we need to understand what optical isomerism is. Optical isomers are a type of stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other and are non-superimposable. Such molecules are called enantiomers and usually contain a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different substituents (often denoted as a stereogenic center).

Another factor that could lead to optical isomerism is the presence of a chiral axis or plane of chirality where there is no single chiral atom necessarily, but the molecule as a whole lacks an internal plane of symmetry and cannot be superimposed on its mirror image (such as in binaphthyls where rotation around a connecting bond is restricted).

Let us analyze the given compounds step by step:

#### dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate

First, let us interpret the name "dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate" systematically:
1. "[1,1'-biphenyl]" indicates a biphenyl structure where two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions (i.e., one benzene ring is connected to another at one carbon atom).
2. "6,6'-dinitro" indicates that there are two nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions on the biphenyl structure (i.e., on the sixth carbon atom on each benzene ring relative to the connection point).
3. "2,2'-dicarboxylate" means that there are carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions on the biphenyl structure. Specifically, "dimethyl 2,2'-dicarboxylate" means that the two carboxylate groups are esterified with methanol, so there should be two methyl ester groups (i.e., COOCH₃) attached.

Drawing the molecule based on the given instructions:
$$
\binom{\text{Benzene ring with a methyl carboxylate group on position 2 (i.e., ortho to the ring connection), a nitro group on position 6 (which is para to the ring connection), connected to another benzene ring which also has a methyl carboxylate group on position 2 and a nitro group on position 6}}{\text{Biphenyl structure where the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions}}.
$$

However, a significant part of reasoning about optical isomerism for biphenyl compounds is related to atropisomerism where restricted rotation around the bond connecting the two phenyl rings can lead to a chiral axis if there is enough steric hindrance such that the two rings cannot coplanarize or rotate freely. For a biphenyl compound like $6,6'-\text{dinitro}-[1,1'-\text{biphenyl}]-2,2'-\text{dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester}$, if the two benzene rings cannot rotate freely due to bulky substituents at the ortho positions (positions 2 and 2', and possibly 6 and 6' might also contribute), the molecule might be chiral if both benzene rings are not symmetric themselves.

However, in symmetric biphenyls where substitution on each ring is symmetric (such as having identical substituents in symmetric positions on both benzene rings), one needs to verify if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. 

However, the overall question hinges on whether the compound itself lacks a plane of symmetry such that the molecule itself could be chiral. For dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate:
$$
\ce{O2N-\phantom{1}[}\faBenzene\faBenzeneRing{-COOCH3}\faBenzene{(NO2)}]-\faBenzeneRing{-COOCH3}\faBenzene]}
$$

To make a more visual representation, here is a possible sketch structure (note that replacing benzene rings with "Ph" for brevity):

![general biphenyl structure where Ph denotes a benzene ring]
This would be:
$$
(\text{2-COOCH3, 6-NO2})-Ph-Ph-(\text{2'-COOCH3, 6'-NO2})
$$
The benzene rings might rotate such that the molecule might have a chiral axis under some conditions where the two rings cannot freely rotate so that they stay orthogonal (i.e., when rotations are restricted due to steric hindrance). However, the question does not specifically mention if such biphenyl compounds could indeed show optical isomerism under standard conditions where free rotation might make them achiral.

Another thing to check is whether the molecule itself has a plane of symmetry. The biphenyl compound has mirror planes if rotation makes the two rings coplanar. However, biphenyl derivatives might exhibit atropisomeric chirality when there is steric hindrance preventing free rotation about the central C-C bond joining the two benzene rings such that rings are not coplanar. This usually requires bulky substituents at ortho positions (2 and 6 positions are ortho positions relative to the ring connection point which is labeled as position 1). 

However, the real issue here is to check whether the two parts of the molecule are symmetrical such that any part of the biphenyl structure looks like a mirror image of the other part. Being symmetric here might make the compound achiral if there is a plane of symmetry. 

However, a molecule such as $6,6'-\text{dinitro}-2,2'-\text{dicarboxylate biphenyl}$ should exhibit axial chirality if there is restricted rotation about the central biphenyl bond such that the molecule lacks a plane or a center of symmetry. Typically, biphenyl derivatives become chiral if there are substituents on the two benzene rings such that the structures make the rings unable to align in a planar conformation due to steric hindrance such that two non-superimposable mirror images could exist.

However, another important question needs to be answered here — whether such biphenyl compounds exhibit significant atropisomers that are stable enough at room temperature. For chiral axis-based chirality, the two rings should be perpendicularly oriented where the molecule has two stable configurations which are mirror images of each other. Thus, biphenyls like this one could show optical isomerism due to “atropisomers” where rotation about the single bond connecting the two phenyl rings is hindered because of bulky groups (ortho-substituted biphenyls).

Thus, "dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate" seems to show optical isomerism due to axial chirality.

#### 2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

This compound is also known as methyl lactate. Its structure is:
$$
\ce{CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3}
$$
The carbon atom that is attached to the hydroxyl group (OH) is the central carbon (the second carbon in the chain CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3 where the alpha carbon carries four different groups:
$$
\ce{-CH3}, \ \ce{-OH}, \ \ce{-H}, \text{ and } \ce{-COOCH3}.
$$
Due to a chiral carbon center (i.e., a carbon atom attached to four different groups), methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should show optical isomerism (i.e., it has two enantiomers unless it is specifically referring to a racemic mixture or one of the pure enantiomers).

#### 3. benzophenone

The structure of benzophenone is:
$$
\ce{C6H5-CO-C6H5}
$$
The central part is a carbonyl group with two phenyl groups attached to it:
$$
\ce{Ph-CO-Ph}
$$
This symmetric structure does not have any asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms (i.e., a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents). Furthermore, benzophenone itself has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group such that the two phenyl groups are symmetrically placed on either side of the plane. Thus, benzophenone does not show optical isomerism.

#### 4. dimethyl fumarate

The structure of fumaric acid is:
$$
\ce{HOOC-CH=CH-COOH}
$$
The name "fumarate" suggests that it is the trans isomer of the double bond (which is the more stable isomer for dicarboxylic acids such as HOOC-CH=CH-COOH). "dimethyl fumarate" thus refers to:
$$
\ce{CH3OOC-CH=CH-COOCH3}
$$
The double bond here is in the trans configuration (fumarate refers to the trans isomer of butenedioic acid). The most important part for optical isomerism is checking whether there is a chiral carbon atom or plane or axis of chirality present in the molecule.

However, for any compound to be chiral, it should not have a plane of symmetry. However, dimethyl fumarate does have a plane of symmetry bisecting through the double bond such that the molecule is symmetric and thus achiral (which makes it not show optical isomerism).

Based on the reasoning above, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate definitely shows optical isomerism due to a chiral carbon center. However, "dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate" shows axial chirality if there is hindered rotation leading to distinct atropisomers. 

Considering that both need to be verified for stability and significance of such isomers, it appears that "dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate" should indeed exhibit optical isomerism when restricted rotation makes the chiral axis significant (though this may depend on the actual steric hindrance and the energy barrier to rotation).

However, the question should be validated for such "axial chirality" cases specifically. However, typically methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also known as methyl lactate) clearly exhibits chiral carbon center isomerism.

However, let us check some sources or conventions on such biphenyl compound. Another compound similar to "dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate" is when there are ortho-ortho substituents that make the biphenyl structure chiral if the rotation around the biphenyl bond is restricted enough so that the two rings cannot lie in one plane and make the compound asymmetric. Another well-known case here is the "BINAP" ligand which is a chiral biphenyl compound where the ortho positions have bulky substituents such that the biphenyl backbone is chiral. 

Based on the answer choices, benzophenone and dimethyl fumarate are clearly symmetric and thus do not show optical isomerism. Thus, it seems that compounds that show optical isomerism are:

(A) dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
(B) methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

However, it seems that the reasoning indicates that both (1) and (2) should show chirality. However, there seems to be an implicit question here which requires us to check which of the given molecules have a definite center of chirality or a real stable chiral configuration. 

However, one should check if "dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate" should actually be symmetrical because if the biphenyl is symmetrical such that the two halves are mirror images of another half, it would not show optical isomerism unless there is a specific chiral axis type of chirality. 

But if biphenyl is rotated such that one ring twists relative to the other due to steric hindrance for ortho substituents (like NO2 and COOCH3 groups here), which creates a stable non-planar configuration where the molecule lacks plane of symmetry, this might make the molecule chiral due to "restricted rotation," which is known as "atropisomerism."

However, for "methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (methyl lactate)" it seems pretty straightforward that there is a chiral carbon atom (C2 which connects to CH3, OH, H, COOCH3 groups).

Thus, the answer seems already clear that:
1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: Displays atropisomerism where the two benzene rings could be twisted due to bulky ortho groups (specifically, the ortho substituents make the molecule chiral if the rings are twisted out of the plane). Thus, it should show optical isomers.
2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Due to a chiral center (asymmetric carbon), exhibits optical isomerism.

However, benzophenone and dimethyl fumarate should not exhibit optical isomerism due to their symmetric structures.

However, verification is needed for the methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate structure for any potential symmetric configurations might make it non-chiral. However, the answer makes us feel that **both (1) and (2) should show optical isomerism**.

However analysing again dimensions for significant atropisomers for dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-bibiphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, such a molecule might have axial chirality due to bulky ortho substituents making the biphenyl structure chiral if rotation around the central bond is restricted enough so that the two rings cannot lie in one plane.

However, another way to verify biphenyl atropisomer chirality is by examining the stability of the orthogonal form which makes the molecule asymmetric. Usually, the energy barrier for biphenyl rotation should be high enough such that the two atropisomers (which are enantiomers) are stable at room temperature. 

Another important check is being sure that the biphenyl itself is not symmetric such that one ring is a mirror image of the other. Because biphenyl rings themselves could be symmetric if substituents make both rings identical and symmetrical (like in our case where each ring has substituents in the same relative positions), any perpendicular twist could make the molecule chiral. However, checking the other options, benzophenone and dimethyl fumarate should definitely not exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the answer choices should be verified explicitly for which ones show chirality easily. Checking again:
1 is a valid candidate because of the axial chirality which seems probable.
2 is a valid candidate due to chiral carbon.
3 has no chiral center nor any axis of chirality and is symmetric thus not a valid candidate.
4 is symmetrical and does not have a chiral center nor any chiral axis thus not a valid candidate.

Thus, the compounds that show optical isomerism are:
1 and 2.

Thus, the answer should be:
1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate

However, the question seems to be asking for a single answer, so let us make a more in-depth check for the biphenyl compound.

The question seems to be asking for a single answer, so let us make a more in-depth check for the biphenyl compound. 

The biphenyl compound has a structure where the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The 2 and 2' positions have carboxylate groups (as methyl esters), while the 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups. 

The question is whether the biphenyl compound has a plane of symmetry. The biphenyl compound can be represented as follows:

$$
\ce{(NO2)C6H3(COOCH3)-C6H3(COOCH3)(NO2)}
$$
where the nitro groups are at the 6 and 6' positions (para to the biphenyl bond) and the carboxylate groups are at the 2 and 2' positions (ortho to the biphenyl bond).

To make a more visual representation, the structure can be drawn explicitly:
$$
\ce{(O2N)Ph(COOCH3)-Ph(COOCH3)(NO2)}
$$
where "Ph" represents a benzene ring where the "1" position is the one connected to the other benzene ring. 

The question is whether there is a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the biphenyl bond that makes the two halves mirror images of each other. However, the question is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes it achiral. 

However, the biphenyl compound has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the biphenyl bond if the two benzene rings are coplanar. However, if the two benzene rings are not coplanar due to steric hindrance from the ortho substituents (i.e., the 2 and 2' carboxylate groups), the molecule might be chiral if the two rings are twisted such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.
