# Original Question

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons.

The energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.

What is the angle between the directions of the photons?

To solve for the angle between the two resultant photons produced by the annihilation of an electron and a positron moving towards each other, we need to apply conservation of momentum and energy. Given that the electron has a Lorentz factor $\gamma_e = 4$ and moves from left to right along the horizontal axis, and that the positron has a Lorentz factor $\gamma_p = 2$ and moves from right to left along the horizontal axis, we need to find what happens when they collide and annihilate to produce two photons with equal energies such that one photon moves in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction.

First, let us recall some fundamental relations for particles with a given Lorentz factor $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ where $v$ is the velocity of the particle and $c$ is the speed of light. Another important relation is the energy of a particle with rest mass $m_0$ given by $E = \gamma m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass of the particle (for an electron or a positron here, $m_0 = m_e$, where $m_e$ is the rest mass of an electron).

The problem states that upon annihilation, two photons are produced where:
1. The energies of the two photons are measured as equal.
2. One photon is emitted in the "upper-right direction" while the other photon is emitted in the "lower-right direction."

To find the angle formed by the directions of the two photons, let us set up a coordinate system where the positive $x$-axis points to the right (hence left to right motion is positive $x$ direction and right to left motion is negative $x$ direction). 

First, define the four-momenta for the electron and positron before the collision. Given that the electron has a Lorentz factor of $\gamma_e = 4$, its total energy $E_e$ and momentum $p_e$ are given by:
$$
E_e = \gamma_e m e c^2,
$$
$$
p_e = \gamma_e \beta_e m_e c,
$$
where $\beta_e = \dfrac{v_e}{c}$ and $\gamma_e = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta_e^2}}$. However, a well-known relation that links $\gamma$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ is:
$$
\beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}.
$$
Similarly, for the positron with a Lorentz factor of $\gamma_p = 2$:
$$
E_p = \gamma_p m_e c^2,
$$
$$
p_p = \gamma_p \beta_p m_e c,
$$
where $\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}}$ for the positron:
$$
\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \overrightarrow{\beta}_p = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
$$
However, since the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right to the left (which means it moves in the negative $x$ direction), the momentum should be assigned a negative sign:
$$
\beta_p = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
$$
The energy calculations for the electron and positron are:
$$
E_e = \gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4m_e c^2,
$$
$$
E_p = \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2m_e c^2.
$$
Total energy before collision is thus:
$$
E_{\text{total}} = E_e + E_p = 4m_e c^2 + 2m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2.
$$
To find the momenta explicitly:
$$
p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = \gamma_e \beta_e m_e c = 4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} \cdot m_e c = \sqrt{15} m_e c,
$$
$$
p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = \gamma_p \beta_p m_e c = 2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \cdot m_e c = -\sqrt{3} m_e c.
$$
(Recall that since the positron moves from right to left, $p_p$ should be negative.)

Total momentum before collision is therefore:
$$
p_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{15} m_e c + -\sqrt{3} m_e c = \left(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}\right)m_e c,
$$
which is still in the positive $x$ direction because $\sqrt{15} \approx 3.873$ and $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732$, so $\sqrt{15} > \sqrt{3}$.

After the collision, two photons are produced such energies are equal. Suppose the total energy $6m_e c^2$ is divided equally between the two photons such that each photon has an energy $E_{\gamma_1} = E_{\gamma_2} = 3m_e c^2$. However, conservation of energy tells us:
$$
E_{\gamma_1} + E_{\gamma_2} = E_{\text{total}} = 6m_e c^2.
$$
We are told that one photon moves in the "upper-right direction" and the other in the "lower-right direction." Thus, let us define angles such that one photon makes an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal (positive $x$ direction) and the other makes an angle $\theta$ below the horizontal. 

The total momentum must be conserved such that:
$$
\bm{p}_{\text{total}} = \bm{p}_{\gamma_1} + \bm{p}_{\gamma_2}.
$$
The photons have momenta given by:
$$
p_{\gamma} = \frac{E_{\gamma}}{c} \quad (\since E_{\gamma} = p_{\gamma} c).
$$
Let us decompose the momenta of the two photons (recall that $E_{\gamma_1} = E_{\gamma_2} = 3m_e c^2$, thus $p_{\gamma_1} = p_{\gamma_2} = \frac{E_{\gamma_1}}{c} = 3m_e c$).

The first photon moves in the "upper-right" direction making an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal axis (positive $x$ direction). Thus, the momentum components are:
$$
\bm{p}_{\gamma_1} = \left(3m_e c \cos{\theta}, 3m_e c\sin{\theta}\right).
$$
Similarly, the second photon moves in the "lower-right" direction making an angle $\theta$ (below the horizontal):
$$
\bm{p}_{\gamma_2} = \left(3m_e c\cos{\theta}, -3m_e c\sin{\theta}\right).
$$
Total momentum in the $x$ direction (horizontal component of the total photon momenta) should equal the horizontal momentum before collision:
$$
p_{\gamma_1x} + p_{\gamma_2x} = 3m_e c\cos{\theta} + 3m_e c\cos{\theta} = 6m_e c\cos{\theta}.
$$
Total momentum in the $y$ direction (vertical component) should equal the vertical momentum before collision. Note that there was no initial vertical momentum:
$$
p_{\gamma_1y} + p_{\gamma_2y} = 3m_e c\sin{\theta} - 3m_e c\sin{\theta} = 0.
$$
The $x$ component matches what we need for momentum conservation on the $x$ axis:
$$
6m_e c\cos{\theta} = \left(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}\right)m_e c,
$$
which simplifies to:
$$
\cos{\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
$$
We need to find the numerical value of the inverse cosine:
$$
\cos{\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx \frac{3.87298 - 1.73205}{6} \approx \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.3568,
$$
$$
\theta = \cos^{-1}(0.3568) \approx 69.1^\circ.
$$
Hence, the angle between the two photons would be twice $\theta$, since one photon makes an angle of $\theta$ above the positive $x$ axis and the other makes an angle of $\theta$ below the positive $x$ axis. Thus:
$$
\text{angle between the two photons} = \theta + \theta = 2\theta.
$$
So:
$$
2\theta = 2 \times \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrtifteen - \mathtt{\sqrt{3}}}{6}\right) \approx 2 \times 69.1^\circ = 138.2^\circ.
$$
However, the question also requires expressing the angle explicitly. Thus, the question requires us to evaluate:
$$
\cos{\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
$$
However, what we need is the angle between the two photons. Another representation is:
$$
2\theta = 2 \arctan{\left(\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{1 + \cos\theta}}\right)} \text{ may be used for alternative verification but $2\theta$ is what we need}.
$$
Therefore, the total angle between the two photons is:
$$
2\theta = 2 \arctan{\left(\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{1 + \cos\theta}}\right)} \text{ is a roundabout way to find $\theta$},
$$
but from the real part we need to verify once:
$$
\cos{2\theta} = 2\cos^2\theta - 1.
$$
Thus:
$$
\cos 2\theta = 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}\right)^2 - 1,
$$
$$
\cos 2\theta = 2 \left(\frac{15 - 2\sqrt{15}\sqrt{3} + 3}{36}\right) - 1,
$$
$$
\cos 2\theta = 2 \cdot \frac{18 - 2\sqrt{45}}{36} - 1,
$$
$$
\cos 2\theta = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{18 - 6\sqrt{5}}{36}\right) - 1,
$$
$$
\cos 2\theta = \frac{36 - 12\mathrm{\sqrt{5}}}{36} - 1,
$$
$$
\cos 2\theta = 1 - \frac{12\sqrt{5}}{36} - 1,
$$
$$
\cos 2\theta = \frac{36 - 12\sqrt{5}}{36} - \frac{36}{36} = \frac{36 - 12\sqrt{5} - 36}{36} = \frac{-12\sqrt{5}}{36} = -\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3},
$$
hence,
$$
\cos 2\theta \approx -0.7454,
$$
$$
2\theta = \cos^{-1} \left(-\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right) \approx 138.2^\circ.
$$
So, the angle between the two photons should be approximately $138.2^\circ$.

However, a simpler way might be to recall that once $\theta$ is found from $\cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx 69.1^\circ$, thus $2\theta \approx 138.2^\circ$ directly.

To make sure everything is verified correctly once again explicitly:
1) By checking the total energy $6m_e c^2$ should equate to:
$$
6m_e c^2 = 3m_e c^2 + 3m_e c^2,
$$
which holds true.
2) For total momentum conservation:
$$
(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})m_e c = 6m_e c \cos\theta,
$$
which implies:
$$
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
$$
The angle itself is what we need here such that the angle between the two photon trajectories is given by $2\theta$. 

Finally, the angle between the two photons appears to be $2\theta$, where:
$$
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}\right) \approx 69.1^\circ,
$$
$$
2\theta \approx 138.2^\circ.
$$
Thus, put the answer in radians if desired (since $138.2^\circ \approx 138.2 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 2.412 \text{ radians}$).

However, let us summarize:
### Verification of computations 

1. **Total energy before collision:**
$$
E_{\text{total}} = 6m_e c^2.
$$
2. **Total momentum before collision (in x-axis):**
$$
p_{\text{total}} = (\sqrt{15} - \service{3})m_e c.
$$
3. **Total energy after collision should be again $6m_e c^2$, divided unequally until verified that both photons have same energy $m_e c^2$ each such that total momentum should conserve $x$ component alone's component:
Energy conservation:
$$
3m_e c^2 + 3m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2.
$$
Momentum conservation in $x$ direction:
$$
p_x (\text{before}) = \left(\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}\right)m_e c \approx 2.1409m_e c,
$$
$$
p_x (\text{after}) = 3m_e c \cos \theta + 3m_e c \cos \theta = 6m_e c \cos \theta,
$$
$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6} \approx 0.3568,
$$
$$
Momentum in $y$ direction before is $0$ :
$$
p_y (\text{after}) = 3m_e c\sin\theta - 3m_e c\sin\theta = 0,
$$
which conserves $y$ component of momentum as well.

Thus, the angle between the photons is:
$$
\boxed{138.2^\circ} \text{ (approximately)}.
$$

However, a precise expression for the angle should be:
$$
2\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}\right) \text{ (where $\cos^{-})$ calculates cosine in radians arcs thus $2\theta = 2\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}\right)$.
$$

However, it's good to make sure our overall logic is sound but for angles is:
$$
\boxed{2\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{}\sqrt{3}}{6}\right)}.
$$
Calculators give:
$$
2 \times 69.1^\circ = 138.2^\circ.
$$
Alternatively, in degrees it will be approximately $138^\circ$.

Therefore, extending our check one more time is important:
If we solve $\cos 2\theta = 2\cos^2\theta - 1$, by defining specifically $\cos\theta$:
Specifically,
$$
\cos 2\theta = 2\left(\frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}\right)^2 - 1 = 2 \left(\frac{15 - 2\sqrt{45} + 3}{36лакти}\right) - পূর্ব numerator = 15 +隐藏在3 - 2\sqrt{45} = 18 - 6\sqrt{5}.
$$
This makes:
$$
\cos 体育锻炼\theta = 2 \cdot \frac{18 - 6\sqrt{5找死}}{36} - 1 = \frac{18 - 6\sqrt{5}}{转折18} - 1 = \frac{18 - 6\sqrt{5} - 18线}{18} = \frac{-6\sqrt{5}}{18} =例子-\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3} \approx -0.745.
$$
Hence:
$$
2\theta = \cos^{-1}\leftedit-\frac{\sqrt{5 weapons}}{3}\right) \approx 138.2^\circ.
$$
Henceforth,的時候答案似乎是正确的，验证。

Conclusion: The angle between the two photons is thus:
$$
2\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}\right) \text{ (in radians)} \text{ or }138.2^\circ.
$$
Accurately, round the answer to a sensible precision such as $138.2^\circ$.
