# Original Question

A common approximation made in many-body nuclear calculations of some interaction (for example an electroweak interaction) is to suppose that nucleons in a nucleus behave in the same way as free nucleons. Which of the following four assumptions jointly imply this ""impulse"" approximation?

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

To solve which of these assumptions jointly imply the "impulse" approximation where nucleons in a nucleus behave similarly to free nucleons, let us reason through each statement individually.

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.**
   - This means that the interaction occurs only at the level of individual nucleons, rather than involving multiple nucleons simultaneously or any nuclear collective behavior. This supports the idea that interactions within the nucleus can be treated as a sum of interactions with individual nucleons.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.**
   - This implies that once a single nucleon is targeted by the interaction, the rest of the nucleus does not interact or interfere with the process involving that selected nucleon. This supports the "impulse" approximation because it suggests that once a single nucleon is being acted upon, it behaves independently of the rest of the nucleus.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.**
   - This statement specifies something about the internal structure of the selected nucleon (specifically, that the quarks within that nucleon are non-relativistic). However, the "impulse" approximation refers to the nuclear behavior where a nucleon behaves similarly to a free nucleon; it doesn’t directly address whether the quarks within the nucleon are relativistic or non-relativistic.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.**
   - This directly states that the interaction happens as if the nucleon is free from nuclear binding forces. This fits well with the "impulse" approximation because it explicitly states that the nucleon behaves as if it were free (i.e., not bound in the nucleus).

Based on the descriptions above, the "impulse" approximation requires that the interaction should treat the "selected nucleon" similarly to a free nucleon. For that, it seems necessary that interaction should only affect individual nucleons (statement 1), that no interaction should involve multiple nucleons simultaneously or that the rest of the nucleus shouldn’t interfere once a single nucleon is involved (statement 2), and that the interaction should proceed as if the nucleon is not subject to nuclear binding forces (statement 4).

However, statement 3 seems less directly relevant here because the "impulse" approximation focuses on the nuclear effects on the nucleon rather than the internal quark dynamics within that nucleon. 

Based on this reasoning, it seems that the "impulse" approximation requires:
1. The interaction only interacts with individual nucleons (statement 1).
2. The nucleus should behave as transparent apart from the selected nucleon (statement 2).
4. The interaction should proceed as if the nucleon experiences no binding forces (statement 4).

However, some part of the question seems a bit ambiguous because "impulse" approximation could be defined differently in different contexts. However, a well-known form of the impulse approximation assumes that the incoming particle interacts with a single nucleon as if that nucleon were "off-shell" and yet the interaction itself happens as seen in a free nucleon. 

However, another part of the impulse approximation is that the initial and final state interactions (i.e., any additional nuclear effects such as multiple scatterings or interactions with the rest of the nucleus) should be negligible. Thus, among the given assumptions, statements 1, 2, and 4 seem to be the most relevant.

However, a well-known "impulse approximation" usually makes the following assumptions:
    
    - The interaction current only affects one nucleon at a time (i.e., single-particle current).
    - The nucleon that participates in the interaction behaves similarly to a free nucleon (thus, ignoring nuclear binding effects).

However, a "non-interacting" nucleus where the "nucleus is transparent" might be a way of interpreting "final state interactions are neglected," which makes statement 2 seem important here as well.

Based on a standard understanding and analysis of the impulse approximation, what seems most relevant can be summarized thus:

The impulse approximation makes three main assumptions summarized as:
1. The interaction only interacts with single nucleons (statement 1 is true).
2. The rest of the nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon (statement 2 is seeming accurate).
3. The interaction proceeds as if the nucleon is free from binding forces (statement 4 is true).

However, statement 3 about quarks inside the nucleon being non-relativistic seems like a more specific detail that might be related to an underlying model for nucleon structure but does not directly address the "impulse approximation" itself.

Based on this reasoning, a valid answer could be that assumptions 1, 2, and 4 together contribute to the "impulse" approximation.

However, a more traditional way of phrasing the impulse approximation might be that the interaction should act on a single nucleon which should behave as though it is free. Another often mentioned part is that final state interactions should be negligible (which seems to be what statement 2 might imply). 

Thus, one might check the options:
If by jointly, the question means that all required statements should be included to make up the full "impulse" approximation, a valid answer seems like:
### Only assumptions numbered 1, 2, and 4 should jointly contribute to the impulse approximation.

However, if you need a more well-understood form from typical definitions:
Statement 3 ("The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.") appears less relevant here.

Based on this reasoning, let us verify the question's reasoning correctly identifies which statements make up the "impulse" approximation. 

Without a doubt, statement 1 and statement 4 seem important here. Statement 2 seems relevant for what is called "final state interactions." Hence, to make sure:
1 is true and important for single-particle currents only intervening.
2 makes sense because once one nucleon is hit ("selected"), the rest of the nucleus should not influence what happens.
4 makes sense because the interaction should make the nucleon act as if it is "free," i.e., it does not "feel" the binding force from nuclear interactions.

However, statement 3 seems not directly related to the impulse approximation for nuclear physics calculations where it's usually about how a single nucleon should react similarly to a free one.

Based on our reasoning, the answer should be:
1, 2, and 4.

However, a more conventional way to phrase the impulse approximation involves:
1. The impulse approximation assumes that the interaction acts predominantly on a single nucleon as if it were a free particle (which implies statements such as 1 and 4 are significant here).
2. The interaction should be such that the "final-state interactions" should be negligible which makes statement 2 useful here.

However, statement 1 seems indeed needed for the interaction current to interact only with individual nucleons which makes it important. Thus, the answer appears to be:

Based on what makes most sense here, the answer can be interpreted as:
$$1, 2, \text{ and } 4.$$

However, a final check is required for a variable order of the options such as "1, 4", "2, 4", "1, 2, 4", so it appears that only assumptions 1, 2, and 4 are required for impulse approximation reasoning. 

However, what is usually directly mentioned in the "impulse approximation" is:
    
1. Interaction acts independently on individual nucleons (statement 1).
4. The "selected" nucleon should act as if it were free (statement 4).

Thus, it seems that there might be some part of the "impulse" approximation that doesn't strictly require statement 2. But another interpretation is that "nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon" might imply that the interaction itself should only affect one chosen nucleon and ignore the rest of the nucleus until after the interaction has occurred which makes it still important until another part of the nucleus influences post-event.

However, a more standard “impulse” approximation seems to state that:
1. The incident particle interacts directly with a single nucleon such that:
    - The rest of the nucleus plays no part in the interaction itself (which might be what statement 2 implies).

To summarize, all statements jointly implying the "impulse" approximation should thus be:
However, we check the question structure and the assumptions should jointly imply the approximated behavior mentioned. Therefore, let us make a conclusion here:
1, 2, and 4 should be the core assumptions for the impulse approximation.

Without statement 3 which speaks only to the internal structure of the nucleon itself (quarks being non-relativistic), it appears that the answer should indeed be statements 1, 2, and 4 seem necessary for the "impulse" approximation.

Thus, the correct answer seems to be:
1, 2, and 4.

However, another way to make an argument about the necessity of statement 3 might be that if the quarks were extremely relativistic, the internal structure calculations could be complex—but that seems more related to nucleon models rather than the simple impulse approximation.

However, another way to ensure clarity in solving is to verify that only the assumptions 1, 2, and 4 make up what is typically referred to as the impulse approximation (more about the nucleus making individual nucleons behave like free nucleons). Thus, those three assumptions make up what is commonly known as the impulse approximation.

However, one must make sure that others who study nuclear physics indeed validate these three assumptions. Therefore, an answer based purely on reasoning makes us believe that:
1, 2, and 4 seem reasonable choices for the "impulse approximation."

Hence, the answer is:
1, 2, and 4 jointly imply the "impulse" approximation.

However, from a technical standpoint, the traditional Impulse Approximation also assumes what statements 1, 2, and 4 seem to describe. But typically statement 3 is not part of the impulse approximation definition in nuclear physics. 

Because it requires us to select which assumptions "jointly imply" the impulse approximation, an answer should be constructed thus:

Answer:
Options 1, 2, and 4 should be the assumptions that jointly imply the "impulse" approximation.

However, we need to make sure what "jointly" means here. It means that all three should be considered together:
"If 1, 2, and 4 are true, then the impulse approximation holds true." 

However, another suitable verification is that any of the other options do not make sense for impulse approximation. Hence, from the provided choices, the answer should indeed be:
$$
1, 2, \text{  and }  4.
$$

Thus, the response should clearly state that the answer we need here is:
**1, 2, and 4.**

However, there’s a problem here in the question statement that makes us check if there is any wrong option missing here. According to ?1?, 2 and 4 are well known for impulse approximation whereas 3 is not. 

To make it clear, this means that only statements 1, 2, and 4 appear relevant for implying the impulse approximation. More specifically:
```
1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
```
Thus, the correct answer seems to be:
**1, 2, and 4.**

Thus, the assumptions that jointly imply the "impulse" approximation are:
1, 2, and 4.
Hence, option 3 ("The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.") is not part of standard impulse approximation assumptions.
