To solve for the question of distinguishing two quantum states with energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ such that their lifetimes are given as $10^{-9}$ seconds for state $1$ and $10^{-8}$ seconds for state $2$, we need to consider the Heisenberg uncertainty principle which gives us a lower bound on the uncertainty in energy for a given lifetime of a quantum state. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle for energy and time is given by:

$$
\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
$$
where $\Delta E$ represents the uncertainty in energy and $\Delta t$ is the uncertainty in time, which can typically be interpreted as the lifetime of the quantum state ($\tau$).

However, a more commonly used form of this relation is:
$$
\Delta E \Delta t \geq \hbar,
$$
which is a more "generic" form where $\Delta E \Delta t \sim \hbar$. Therefore, for our calculations here, we can use $\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}$, where $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}$ ($h$ is Planck’s constant, $h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34}\, \text{Js}$).

The “energy width” (or energy uncertainty) for a state with a lifetime $\tau$ is thus given by:
$$
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
$$
This means that the "energy spread" for a quantum state characterized by a lifetime $\tau$ makes it difficult to resolve two energy states if their energy difference is comparable to or less than this energy spread.

For the first quantum state with a lifetime $10^{-9}$ seconds:
$$
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{\hbar}{10^{-9} \text{ s}} = \hbar \times 10^9 \text{ s}^{-1}.
$$
Similarly, for the second quantum state with a lifetime $10^{-8}$ seconds:
$$
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{\hbar}{10^{-8} \text{ s}} = \hbar \times 10^8 \text{ s}^{-1}.
$$
However, what we fundamentally need here is the total "linewidth" (or uncertainty) which affects the resolution of the two energy levels $E_1$ and $E_2$. 

However, what matters here is how well-separated the two energy levels should be such that the "linewidths" do not cause significant overlap. For example, if the energy widths (linewidths) for the two states significantly overlap, it would make it difficult to "resolve" the two energy levels distinctly.

The question now is: what should be the energy difference $|E_1 - E_2|$ such that they can be "clearly resolved"? 

The combined linewidth might be treated roughly as the sum of the uncertainties in $E_1$ and $E_2$, which is:
$$
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = \hbar \times 10^9 + \hbar \times 10^8,
$$
so:
$$
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \hbar \times \left(10^9 + 10^8\right) = \hbar \times \left(1.1 \times 10^9\right) \text{ s}^{-1}.
$$
However, a possibly more appropriate way to treat the total linewidth could be as a convolution of the two linewidths or simply the larger of the two linewidths if that one dominates the apparent resolution. However, a usual condition often used in spectroscopy for resolving two peaks is that their separation should be equal to or greater than the "natural linewidth" of the peaks themselves. 

This linewidth can be approximated by calculating the "energy width" for the state with the shorter lifetime (since it contributes a larger uncertainty in energy):
$$
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{10^{-9}} = 10^9 \hbar.
$$
where $\hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \text{ Js}$.

Conversely, the linewidth for the second state is:
$$
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{10^{-8}} = 10^8 \hbar.
$$
Thus, a safe measure could be that the energy difference should be greater than the linewidth contributed by the state with the largest energy broadening (larger linewidth), which would be $10^9 \hbar$.

Alternatively, a common criterion called the "Rayleigh criterion" for distinguishing two spectral lines is that their separation should be greater than the "full width at half maximum" (FWHM) of the line profiles. Thus, for simplicity, we need the energy difference $|E_2 - E_1|$ to be greater than the full width at half-maximum for at least the wider linewidth. Therefore, a common criterion is that:
$$
|E_2 - E_1| \geq \max(\Delta E_1, \Delta E_2).
$$
However, a more stringent criteria might require that:
$$
|E_2 - E_1| \geq \max(\Delta E_1, \Delta E_2).
$$
However, it makes more sense here for us to make a more conservative estimate such that any "clearly resolved" energy difference should satisfy:
$$
|E_2 - E_1| > \frac{\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2}{2}.
$$
This makes some sense if one considers that $|E_2 - E_1|$ should be larger than the "average" of the two linewidths until we make a more specific representation such as a convolution of Lorentzian profiles where full width at half-maxima would be added together.

However, a useful "resolution criterion" could be that the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the half-widths at half-maximum (although here actually we need it to suffice such that the total widths do not make the two peaks indistinguishable). 

Based on our calculations, the total lifetime-related linewidth ("natural linewidth") would be:
$$
\hbar \left(1 \times 10^9 + 1 \times 10^8\right) = 1.1 \times 10^9 \hbar,
$$
where $\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \pi} \text{ Js} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ Js}$.

Let us now calculate the total energy uncertainty explicitly (using $\hbar \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ Js}$):
$$
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = 1.1 \times 10^9 \hbar \text{ s}^{-1} = 1.1\cdot 10^9 \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}.
$$
$$
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 1.1594 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J}.
$$
This answer needs to be converted into electron volts (eV), recalling that $1 \text{ eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$:
$$
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \text{ (in eV)} = \frac{1.1594 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}}.
$$
$$
\Delta E_{\text{total}} \text{ (in eV)} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}.
$$
However, another round of reasoning could be like this: What is the isolated energy width contribution just for the first state?
$$
\Delta E_1 (\text{Js}) = 10^9 \hbar = 10^9 \times (1.054 \times 10^{-34}) = 1.054 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J} .
$$
$$
\Delta E_1 (\text{eV}) = \frac{1.054 \times 10^{-25}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 6.5875 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}.
$$
Similarly, for $\Delta E_2$:
$$
\Delta E_2 (\text{Js}) = 10^8 \hbar = 10^8 \times (1.054 \times 10^{-34}) = 1.054 \times 10^{-26} \text{ J}.
$$
$$
\Delta E_2 (\text{eV}) = \frac{1.054 \times 10^{-26}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 6.5875 \times 10^{-8} \text{ eV}.
$$
Hence, given that the question aims at which one of the given options makes two energy states "clearly resolvable," the energy separation should be greater than the larger of the two linewidths which is roughly $6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ for the first state.

Given multiple option values such as:
(A) $2 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$,
(B) $5 \times 10^{-8} \text{ eV}$,
(C) $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$,
(D) $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$.

The question states that what energy difference makes the two energy levels "clearly resolved".

Based on the previous calculation where the "average" total uncertainty in energy is on the order of $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$, clearly the energy difference should be greater than the total uncertainty such that the two states do not overlap greatly.

We need an energy difference such that $|E_2 - E_1|$ is larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties (since we need a "clear" distinction):
$$
|E_2 - E_1| > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2,
$$
which sums to $6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV} + 6.6 \times 10^{-8} \text{ eV} \approx 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$.

However, a more "common" (and less stringent) way to make a "clearly resolved" requirement might be:
$$
|E_2 - E_1| > \Delta E_1 \text{ or } |E_2 - E_1| > \Delta E_2,
$$
which makes only the bigger one (in this circumstance, $10^{-9}$ second lifetime result in a larger $\Delta E_1$, hence $6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$) matter.

So:
$$
|E_2 - E_1| > 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}.
$$
Hence, one should opt for an energy difference greater than $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{~might only just make it and thus be borderline}$. However, clearly $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ seems a more robust choice here yet it makes $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ the most "clearly resolved" among the given choices if we round $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{~to allow for a margin}$.

However, we need to check the needed energy separation based on a more physical consideration called the "Rayleigh's criterion". 

However, if $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ is considered as a viable answer, $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ should be even better. Yet $7 \times10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ seems already close to the "total" uncertainty energy previously calculated $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$:
We need an option where:
$$
|E_1 - E_2| \geq 1.1 \times 10^9 \hbar,
$$
where:
$$
1.1 \times 10^9 \hbar \text{ (Js)} = 1.1 \times 10^9 \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ Js} = 1.16 \times 10^{-25} \text{ Js}.
$$
Recall that $\hbar \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34}$. Converting energy from Joule to eV again gives:
$$
1.1 \times 10^9 \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J} = 1.16 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J}.
$$
$$
\frac{1.16 \times 10^{-25} \text{ J}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}.
$$
Considering the choices:
(A) $2 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ is too small (less than $\Delta E_{\text{total}}$ or $\Delta E_1$).
(B) $5 \times 10^{-8} \text{ eV}$ is even smaller.
(C) $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ is approximately equal to the total uncertainty $7.25 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ which seems a bit borderline.
(D) $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ is larger than $7.25 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ which makes it a valid candidate such that the two lines could be "better resolved" as compared to $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$.

However, among provided choices, the only option well exceeding $\Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ is $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$. However, $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ is quite close to the previously calculated $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ limit.

Yet, $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ is approximately our lower bound for energy uncertainty. However, "clearly resolved" might require a higher separation such that there is a significant difference which makes $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ a safer choice. Hence, let us check if any given options verify:

1. The stronger part of the required separation might be “clearly resolved” which indicates that the energy difference should be such that two Lorentzian peaks should have minimal overlap. 

Generally, Fabry–Perot interferometer resolution tells us that the "resolving power" should make the separation between peaks at least equal to the full width at half maximum of the "wider" peak. So, to make a "clear" resolution, a difference greater than the sum of half-linewidths could make them "distinct enough."

Based on Rayleigh’s criterion, two peaks are usually considered resolvable if they are separated by at least one half-maximum width. However, another useful way could be "resolvable if the peaks are separated by at least their full width at half maximum."

Based on the given options, choices given are:
A) $2 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$
B) $5 \times 10^{-8} \text{ eV}$
C) $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$
D) $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$

To make a "clearly resolvable" separation, most likely, the answer should be:
$\boxed{9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}}$

However, the question seems a bit ambiguous on what "clearly resolved" means exactly. However, a good "rule of thumb" here is that the energy difference should be greater than the linewidth caused by the state with the shorter lifetime (i.e., largest linewidth). Thus, the energy difference should be larger than $10^9 \hbar$, which is:
$$
10^9 \times 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J} \sim 10^{-25} \text{ J}.
$$
This translates roughly to $10^{-25} / 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ eV} \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$. Thus, any difference larger than $6.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ should make the two states resolvable such that only option C or D makes sense here:

However, $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ seems close to the cutoff where it might be a "borderline" resolvable value while $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ is certainly beyond the $7.25 \times $ necessary.

However, another round validation makes us ensure that $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$ might already be sufficiently larger than the individual energies linewidths, so "clearly resolved" should probably be interpreted here as "clearly distinct lines". 

Considering the most stringent part where total linewidth is:
$$
\hbar (10^9 + 10^8) = 1.1 \times 10^9 \hbar.
$$
which translates to an energy of $7.24 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$. Therefore, $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{eV}$ represents a more robust answer where the two states are "clearly resolved". Another possible alternative might be:
$$
7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV} \text{ is also quite close to the $7.2 \times 10^{-eV}$} \text{ linewidth limit calculated, making it possible but perhaps not "clearly resolved."}
$$

However, there seems to be a minor round-off error earlier. The question here is, if an energy separation matches $\hbar / (10^{-9} \text{ s})$. 

However $\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2$, summing two uncertainties makes sense if we need a "separated" energy spectrum:
$$
10^8 \hbar + 10^9 \hbar = \hbar (10^9 + 10^8) = \hbar \times 11 \times 10^8.
$$
By simple natural linewidth interpretation, two peaks appear separated if their central lines are separated by more than half sum of their linewidths (or a similar conclusion). 

Hence, $7 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ might be considered a border case where such option should make them resolvable but only barely. 

Thus $9 \times 10^{-7} \text{ eV}$ seems a more robust choice where the states are "clearly resolvable".
