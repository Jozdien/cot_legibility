# Original Question

Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:

To solve for the given question, we need to compare the luminosities of two stars where Star_1 has a radius that is 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($R_1 = 1.5 R_2$) and a mass that is also 1.5 times that of Star_2 ($M_1 = 1.5 M_2$). 

The question states that the stars radiate as black bodies. The luminosity $L$ of a black body (which is the total power radiated by the star) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
$$
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4,
$$
where $R$ is the radius of the star, $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the effective surface temperature of the star. 

However, a more common form of the Stefan-Boltzmann law is:
$$
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 = A \sigma T^4,
$$
where $A = 4\pi R^2$ is the surface area of the star. 

To compare the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we need to find the ratio $L_1 / L_2$:
$$
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{4\pi R_1^2 \sigma T_1^4}{4\pi R_2^2 \sigma T_2^4} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
$$
The question states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:
$$
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5.
$$
Thus, the first part of the luminosity ratio becomes:
$$
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
$$
To find the ratio of the temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, we need to use another piece of information given in the question: "Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." 

The wavelength at which a black body appears brightest is given by Wien's displacement law:
$$
\lambda_{\text{max}} T = b,
$$
where $b$ is Wien's displacement constant (approximately $2.897 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \cdot \text{K}$). 

The question states that the wavelengths at which the two stars appear brightest are the same:
$$
\lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2}}.
$$
Using Wien's law for both stars:
$$
\lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1} \text{ and } \lambda_{\text{max,2}} = \frac{b}{T_2}.
$$
Since $\lambda_{\text{max,1}} = \lambda_{\text{max,2}}$:
$$
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \Rightarrow T_1 = T_2.
$$
This means that the effective surface temperatures of the two stars are equal. 

However, there is another part of the question that mentions the radial velocities of the two stars are $0$ km/s for Star_1 and $700$ km/s for Star_2. The radial velocity can cause a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength such that:
$$
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emitted}} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right) \text{ (for $v \ll c$)}.
$$
However, a more common approximation for non-relativistic speeds (i.e., $v \ll c$) is:
$$
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted}} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right),
$$
where $v$ is the radial velocity (positive for a receding source, negative for an approaching source). 

However, the question states that the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same. This means that the "observed" peak wavelengths are the same. However, the "emitted" peak wavelengths might be different due to the Doppler effect caused by the radial velocity of Star_2. 

The question states that the radial velocity of Star_1 is $0$ km/s, so the observed peak wavelength for Star_1 is:
$$
\lambda_{\text{observed,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted,1}}.
$$
However, for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of $700$ km/s (which is $700,000$ m/s), the observed peak wavelength is:
$$
\lambda_{\text{observed,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right),
$$
where $v = 700,000 \text{ m/s}$ and $c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$:
$$
\lambda_{\text{observed,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted,2}} \left(1 + \frac{700,000}{3 \times 10^8}\right) = \lambda_{\text{emitted,2}} \left(1 + \frac{7}{3000}\right).
$$
However, the question states that the "wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest" are the same:
$$
\lambda_{\text{observed,1}} = \lambda_{\text{observed,2}}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\lambda_{\text{emitted,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emitted,2}} \left(1 + \frac{7}{3000}\right).
$$
However, the "emitted" peak wavelength is given by Wien's law:
$$
\lambda_{\text{emitted,1}} = \frac{b}{T_1} \text{ and } \lambda_{\text{emitted,2}} = \frac{b}{T_2}.
$$
So:
$$
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \left(1 + \frac{7}{3000}\right) \Rightarrow \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{7}{3000} \approx 1 + 0.0023333 \approx 1.0023333.
$$
This means that:
$$
T_2 = 1.0023333 T_1.
$$
However, what we need is the reverse relation for the luminosity ratio:
$$
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
$$
We already know that:
$$
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5,
$$
and:
$$
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.0023333} \approx 0.9976719.
$$
Thus, the luminosity ratio becomes:
$$
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \times (0.9976719)^4.
$$
Calculating $(1.5)^2$:
$$
(1.5)^2 = 2.25.
$$
Calculating $(0.9976719)^4$:
$$
(0.9976719)^4 \approx 0.9907.
$$
Thus:
$$
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.229075.
$$
However, a more precise calculation can be done by keeping the fraction:
$$
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left(\frac{1}{1 + \frac{7}{3000}}\right)^4 = 2.25 \left(\frac{3000}{3007}\right)^4.
$$
Calculating $\left(\frac{3000}{3007}\right)^4$:
$$
\left(\frac{3000}{3007}\right)^4 \approx \left(\frac{3000}{3007}\right)^4 \approx (0.9976714)^4 \approx 0.9907.
$$
So:
$$
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.2291.
$$
