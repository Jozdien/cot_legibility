To solve for what the Mott-Gurney equation describes, let us recall the Mott-Gurney equation given:
$$
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}.
$$
This equation is used to describe the "space-charge-limited current" (SCLC) regime in a semiconductor device where:
- $J$ is the current density (typically in units of amperes per square meter, A/m²),
- $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant of the material (typically in units of farad per meter, F/m, where $\epsilon = \epsilon_r \epsilon_0$, $\epsilon_r$ is the relative dielectric constant and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space),
- $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility (typically in units of square meters per volt-second, m²/(V·s)),
- $V$ is the voltage applied across the device (in volts, V),
- $L$ is the length of the device (in meters, m).

The Mott-Gurney equation is a well-known result for a trap-free insulator where the current is limited by space charge effects. The "space-charge-limited current" regime typically occurs when the injected carrier density significantly exceeds the thermally generated carrier density within the material such that the electric field is significantly distorted due to the space charge created by the injected carriers. 

To solve for what makes the Mott-Gurney equation valid, it requires us to verify a few key aspects:

1. **Trap-Free Material**: The Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the insulating material is "trap-free," which means that there are no traps (i.e., localized electronic states where charge carriers can be trapped) that could affect the flow of carriers within the material.

2. **Single Charge Carrier**: The derivation typically assumes that only one type of charge carrier (either holes or electrons, but not both simultaneously) contributes significantly to the current.

3. Ohm's law usually applies when the injected carrier density is much lower than the thermally generated carrier density. Once injected carriers dominate, the Mott-Gurney law can become applicable where the current is limited by the space charge effect.

Based on this reasoning, the question states that "[The Mott-Gurney equation] can be expressed as $J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$ where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and $L$ is the length of the device." 

Considering the question choices, the true statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation should typically involve one of the following valid conditions:

An optimum answer should verify what makes the Mott-Gurney equation valid. However, the question appears to be incomplete because specific statements need to be verified here. However, options should typically imply:
- The Mott-Gurney law is valid when both electrons and holes contribute equally to conduction (which is usually not assumed in SCLC analysis where typically one type of charge carrier dominates).
- The Mott-Gurney law is valid only when the charge transport is ohmic (which is not true; SCLC is beyond ohmic transport where current is proportional to voltage).
- The Mott-Gurney law is valid for trap-free semiconductors where the injected carrier density exceeds the thermally generated carrier density such that the electric field is strongly perturbed by injected charge.
Given what we know, a true statement should be something along the lines that the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free semiconductor where the applied voltage is high enough such that injected carriers exceed the intrinsic carrier density.

However, the question seems to assume some pre-given statements which are not explicitly listed here. However, a common true statement about the Mott-Gurney equation is that it is valid when space charge effects dominate the current flow such that:
- The semiconductor should be trap-free.
- The only carriers are those injected from one electrode until collected by the other electrode.

Based on what we need here, here is what can be generally inferred:
This equation is specifically valid for cases where the current is limited by space charge effects rather than by the thermal generation of charge carriers. Hence, a true statement should be something along the lines that the equation is valid for a trap-free insulator where the current is primarily due to one type of charge carrier (electrons or holes) injected from the contacts such that the current is space-charge limited.

However, to make a more structured statement, another necessary condition for space-charge limited current is that the "injected" carriers should dominate over the "intrinsic" free carriers already present in the material. 

Based on these valid conditions, a usual statement might be:
1. "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid only when the applied voltage induces a charge injection that makes the charge carrier density injected from the electrodes much larger than the thermally generated charge carrier density in the bulk."

Therefore, what seems to be a valid statement about the Mott-Gurney equation could be described as follows:
(This question seems incomplete because multiple-choice options are missing in your question. However, a candidate true statement could be:
"It is valid for trap-free insulators where the current is dominated by one type of charge carrier and the current is limited by space charge.")

However, since the question lacks answer choices, a standard answer should be:

### Verification of the Mott-Gurney Equation

Let us check if any other well-known conditions apply here:

Another common form of the SCLC model is called the Child's law (originally derived for vacuum tubes where the charge carrier mobility is effectively infinity and drift velocity scales with the square root of the electric field.) However, Mott-Gurney adapted this for a solid-state device where the mobility is finite (drift velocity scales proportionally linearly with the electric field due to $v = \mu E$ where $E$ is the electric field).

Considering well-known characteristics such as:
$$
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}.
$$
Also recall that $V$ is the voltage applied across a device of length $L$, thus implying that $J \propto V^2$, which is a quadratic dependence on the applied voltage $V$.

Based purely on the given formula structure and well-known contexts:
1. The Mott-Gurney law holds true when the current varies quadratically with the voltage applied across the device length $L$, thus confirming that the electric field is not uniformly distributed through the device but is instead influenced by the injected charge distribution itself which makes $J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$ valid only under space-charge-limited conditions where the current is proportional to $V^2$ divided by $L^3$. 

Thus summarizing what makes the Mott-Gurney law valid:

The question should provide a few options for us to choose the true statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation. However, a usual valid statement might be:
- The Mott-Gurney equation is valid when the current is limited by space charge effects where charge injection from electrodes dominates over any thermally generated carriers. 

However, common alternative statements often found might be:
1. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid only when the charge transport follows Ohm's law (which is usually false for Mott-Gurney).
2. The equation is valid only when both electrons and holes contribute equally (usually false; typically only one carrier type is dominant).
3. The equation is valid only when charge transport is solely due to diffusion (false, Mott-Gurney typically considers drift current limited by space charge).

However, a more "textbook-accurate" answer should mention that the Mott-Gurney equation assumes a trap-free semiconductor where the current is limited by space charge injection.

However, a plausible answer fits the given formula and well-known physical conditions. For a question like this, a possible answer choice could be:
- "This equation is valid only when the charge carrier density is dominated by injected carriers rather than intrinsic carriers."

However, a typical question might give us options such as:
A) "This equation assumes Ohm's law is valid."
B) "This equation is designed for trap-free semiconductors where space charges dominate."
C) "This equation applies when diffusion currents are dominant."
D) "This equation is used when both electrons and holes contribute equally to the current."

Based on well-known facts, answer B fits well where "This equation is designed for trap-free semiconductors where space charges dominate." However, a stronger and more common phrasing is that "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid under trap-free conditions where current is limited by space charge effects."

However, a more specific answer here might be:
1) Valid only when the electric field generated by the injected charge carriers is significantly greater than the electric field generated by the external bias alone.
2) That the majority of the charge carriers are generated through carrier injection rather than thermally generated intrinsic carriers could make this equation valid.

Based on the context of physics and semiconductor devices, a valid statement could be given after analyzing choices which should be provided here. However, the key points make the question more about understanding the "trap-free" and "space-charge-limited current regime" characteristic of the Mott-Gurney equation.

However, a complete question should provide multiple-choice options such that one could check these against the known conditions where the Mott-Gurney equation is valid. 

However usually:
Answer should be something like "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free insulator where the injected carrier density exceeds the intrinsic carrier density such that the current becomes limited by space charges."
Problem seems like a part of a multiple-choice question where one needs to identify which condition justifies the application of the Mott-Gurney equation.

Without a given set of options here, a standard reply should be:

Options might typically include:
(A) "It is valid for very low voltages only."
(B) "It is valid only when both electrons and holes contribute equally to the current."
(C) "It is valid for a semiconductor where the current is limited by space charge."
(D) "It is valid only if the dielectric constant is unity."

Based on the analysis, the most likely valid reasoning statement about the Mott-Gurney equation is:
*It is valid for a semiconductor where the current is limited by space charge.* 

Thus based on what reasoning and known details the question seems to require an answer that implies that the Mott-Gurney equation is indeed relevant for describing the "space-charge-limited current regime" in a trap-free semiconductor where one type of charge carrier predominates and the current is proportional to the square of the voltage applied. 

Hence, a likely true statement might be similar to what seems like option "C" here. However, a full answer should ideally compare against given options. However, the reasoning shows that the Mott-Gurney equation is indeed valid under the "space-charge-limited current" regime for a trap-free insulator where the current is primarily due to one type of charge carrier.
Hence, the true statement would be:
"The Mott-Gurney equation is valid in the regime where injected charge carriers dominate and space charge effects limit the current."

However traditionally, this answer refers to:
$$
J = \frac{9}{8} \varepsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}.
$$

Thus, a complete question should be verified with specific answer choices which should ideally be provided here.
