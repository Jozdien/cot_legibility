# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to figure out what compound has the formula C9H11NO2 based on the IR and NMR data provided. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step. 

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Plugging in the numbers: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. Assuming X (halogens) is 0. So that's (2*9 + 2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (18 +2 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean five rings, but that's unlikely. More probably, it's a combination of double bonds and rings. Each double bond or ring is one degree. Each triple bond is two. So maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) plus a double bond and a ring? Hmm, but benzene is three, and maybe a carbonyl (which is a double bond) and an amide or something else. Let me think.

Looking at the IR data: medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So possible ester, ketone, amide, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch around 3000, which isn't mentioned here. The N-H stretches are two peaks, which might suggest an amide (usually two peaks for NH2), but amides have carbonyls too. Wait, but amides have carbonyls around 1650-1700 cm-1. The 1720 cm-1 is more towards an ester or maybe a ketone. But the presence of N-H stretches might indicate that the carbonyl is part of an amide. Wait, maybe it's an ester and an amide? Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe the 3420 and 3325 are from an amine. Primary amines have two N-H stretches, but they are usually a bit lower in wavenumber. Secondary amines have one, but maybe if there's some hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, maybe those are O-H stretches, but they would be broader. The problem states medium to strong intensity, so maybe they're not O-H. So maybe it's an amide. But the carbonyl is at 1720, which is higher than typical amides. Wait, amides are usually around 1650-1700. Esters and ketones are higher. So maybe the carbonyl is an ester, and the N-H is from an amine group. Let's hold that thought.

Now looking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: This is likely a methyl group (3H) split into a triplet. A triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Methyl groups adjacent to a CH2 would give a triplet if the CH2 is split by another group. For example, an ethyl group (CH2CH3) where the CH2 is split, making the methyl a triplet. Wait, in an ethyl group (like in an ester, ethyl acetate), the CH3 would be a triplet if the adjacent CH2 is split by something. But in ethyl acetate, the methyl is a triplet when the adjacent CH2 is split by the oxygen. Wait, actually, in ethyl groups, the methyl is usually a triplet when next to a CH2 that is split by another group. Alternatively, maybe the 1.20 ppm is a methyl adjacent to an oxygen? Wait, but in ethyl esters, the CH2 next to the oxygen is usually around 4.0-4.5 ppm, as a quartet. Let's check the other peaks.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: A broad singlet with 2H. Broad signals are often due to exchange, like NH or OH protons. But here, the integration is 2H. If it's NH2, that could be an amine. But in the IR we saw N-H stretches. If it's an NH2 group, maybe in an amide. But amides usually have NH protons that are downfield. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. Wait, 4.0 is also the region for CH2 groups next to oxygen. But if it's a broad singlet, maybe it's an NH2 that's exchanging. But 4.0 ppm seems a bit upfield for an NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2O- group? Not sure. Let me think.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: Quartet (four peaks) for 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with three neighbors, but since it's 2H, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH3. For example, in an ethyl group (CH2CH3), the CH2 would be a quartet if the adjacent CH3 is split. Wait, but that would be if the CH3 is split by the CH2. Wait, in an ethyl group, the CH2 is next to the CH3. If the CH2 is split by the CH3, the CH2 would be a quartet. But in an ethyl ester, the oxygen is adjacent. For example, in ethyl acetate, the CH2 next to the oxygen is a quartet around 4.1 ppm. The methyl is a triplet at around 1.2 ppm. So that matches the 1.20 triplet (3H) and the 4.5 quartet (2H). So maybe that's an ethyl ester group: OCH2CH3. So the 4.5 ppm quartet would be the OCH2, and the 1.20 triplet is the CH3. Then the 4.0 ppm is something else.

Then the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets each integrating to 2H, with coupling between the protons. So, for example, if there's a substituent in the para position, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents? Wait, but if it's para-substituted, there are two substituents opposite each other. Wait, no, a single substituent would lead to two sets of protons. For example, nitro groups, ester groups, etc. But the coupling between the protons would lead to a doublet for each pair. So maybe the ring has two substituents in para positions. Wait, but the integration is 2H each. Wait, if there are two substituents in para positions, each substituent would be in the para position relative to each other, but that would make the remaining protons as two pairs. Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that causes the splitting. For example, if there's a nitro group in the para position, the adjacent protons would be deshielded. Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent like an ester or an amide group attached to the benzene ring.

Putting this together: if there's a benzene ring with substituents that lead to two doublets, perhaps a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group. The downfield shift of the protons at 8.0 ppm suggests that they are ortho to an electron-withdrawing group. For example, a nitro group para to another group. Wait, but the molecular formula has one N and two O's. Let's think. The formula is C9H11NO2. If there's a benzene ring (C6H5), then the remaining atoms are C3H6NO2. If we have an ethyl ester group (COOCH2CH3), that would be C3H6O2. But then we have an NH somewhere. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count:

Benzene ring: 6 C, 5 H (if substituted with a group that takes one H). Then the substituent would be something like CONH2 (amide) plus an ethyl ester? Wait, but let's try to break it down.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is phenylethyl something. Wait, phenyl group (C6H5), then maybe a -CH2CH2- group. But with the ester and an amide?

Wait, let me consider the ethyl ester. If there's an ethyl ester group (COOCH2CH3), that contributes 4 carbons (COO is 2, CH2CH3 is 2), but wait, COOCH2CH3 is actually 3 carbons (the carbonyl carbon, then the two in the ethyl). Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, but in terms of carbons, it's R-O-CO-R'. So if R' is ethyl, then the ester is O-CO-OCH2CH3, but the carbonyl is part of the main chain. Hmm. Maybe the structure is something like phenyl-ethyl ester with an amide.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count:

If there's a benzene ring (6 C, 5 H), then the remaining is C3H6NO2. Let's see: if we have an ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3), that's 2 carbons (the ethyl) plus the carbonyl and oxygen. Wait, the carbonyl is one carbon. So COOCH2CH3 is 3 carbons (COO is part of the main chain). So if the main chain is something like R-COOCH2CH3, where R is a group that includes the benzene and the NH. Wait, but we need to account for the nitrogen. The formula has one N. So maybe an amide group. For example, if the structure is phenylacetamide ethyl ester? Wait, phenylacetamide would be C6H5CH2CONH2. But then adding an ethyl ester would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzamide derivative.

Wait, let's consider the NMR again. The aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each a doublet. That's typical of para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group. For example, a nitro group in the para position would cause the adjacent protons to be downfield. But the molecular formula has only one N. If the N is in an amide group, then maybe the substituent on the benzene is an amide. Wait, but then where's the ester?

Alternatively, the benzene ring could have an ester group (like a benzoyl ester) and an amide. Wait, but that might complicate the structure. Let me think of another approach.

The IR shows a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which is likely an ester. The N-H stretches suggest an amine or amide. The NMR shows an ethyl group (triplet at 1.2, quartet at 4.5), which is probably the ethyl part of an ester. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be an NH2 group. If that's the case, maybe the structure is an ethyl ester of a para-aminobenzoic acid. Let's see: para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. That would be NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check:

C6 (benzene) + COO (2 O) + CH2CH3 (ethyl) + NH2. So C6 + 3 (COOCH2CH3 is 3 carbons) + 1 (the NH2 is N). Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Para-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethyl ester would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH2CH3. So para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester would be C7H7NO2 - OH (remove H and O) + OCH2CH3 (add C2H5O). So total C7 + 2 = C9, H: 7 -1 (from removing OH) +5 (from OCH2CH3) = 11. N is 1, O: 2 (from original acid) -1 (from OH) +1 (from ester O) = 2. So yes, C9H11NO2. That fits.

Now check the NMR:

The ethyl ester would have the CH3 as a triplet at 1.20 ppm (integral 3H) and the OCH2 as a quartet at 4.5 ppm (integral 2H). That matches the given data. The NH2 group would be a broad singlet. In para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is attached to the benzene ring. However, in the NMR, the NH2 protons are usually around 6-7 ppm if they're aromatic amines, but in this case, the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine (aniline derivative). But aromatic amines can have NH2 protons that are broad and downfield. Wait, but the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. That seems upfield for an NH2. Wait, maybe it's an acetamide group instead. Wait, but acetamide would have the NH2 around higher ppm. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide, but then the carbonyl would be an amide, but the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, which is ester.

Wait, maybe the NH2 is part of a urea or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is in a different environment. Let me think again. In para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. In such compounds, the NH2 protons are typically broad due to exchange with water, and they can be around 4-5 ppm if they are in a de-shielded environment. Wait, but usually, aromatic amines have NH2 protons that are downfield. For example, aniline's NH2 is around 3-4 ppm as a broad peak, but when deprotonated or in a different solvent, it might shift. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is acetylated, making it an acetanilide. But that would introduce another carbonyl.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If it's acetanilide (C8H9NO), then adding an ethyl ester would require more oxygen. Hmm. Maybe not. Let me go back to the para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester idea. Let's check the aromatic protons. In para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, the benzene ring has the NH2 group and the COOEt group in para positions. The aromatic protons would be two doublets because the substituents are para, leading to two sets of equivalent protons. The NH2 is an activating group, so the protons adjacent to it would be upfield, while the protons adjacent to the ester (electron-withdrawing) would be downfield. Wait, but in the NMR data, the downfield protons are at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and the upfield at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H). That makes sense if the ester is at the para position relative to the NH2. The protons next to the ester (electron-withdrawing) would be deshielded (downfield at 8.0 ppm), and those next to the NH2 (electron-donating) would be upfield at 7.0 ppm. So the coupling between the two sets would result in each pair being a doublet. That matches the NMR data.

Now, the NH2 protons in para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester would be expected to be in the NMR, but in the data provided, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). However, NH2 protons in aromatic amines are usually around 5-6 ppm, but they can be broad due to exchange. But 4.0 ppm seems low. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide group. Wait, but if it's an amide, the carbonyl would be around 1650-1700 cm-1. But the IR here has a carbonyl at 1720, which is more ester-like. Hmm. So maybe the NH2 is not part of an amide but a free amine. However, the chemical shift at 4.0 ppm is confusing. Perhaps there's another group causing the NH2 to be upfield. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, but that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe the compound is methyl para-aminobenzoate, but that would have a methyl ester. The given data has an ethyl ester. Let's see, if it's ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the structure would be:

NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, as discussed. The ethyl group would give the triplet and quartet. The NH2 protons are usually broad, but their chemical shift might be lower if there's some hydrogen bonding or solvent effect. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is acetylated, but that would change the molecular formula. Let me check the molecular formula again. For ethyl para-aminobenzoate: C9H11NO2. Yes, that's correct. The NH2 group is part of the amine on the benzene ring. 

In the NMR, the NH2 protons might be exchange broadened and could appear as a broad peak. However, in some cases, especially if the amine is protonated (in acidic conditions), the NH3+ might be around lower ppm. But the problem doesn't mention the solvent or pH. Assuming it's in a neutral solution, the NH2 protons might be around 4-5 ppm as a broad peak. So the 4.0 ppm peak could be the NH2, but that's a bit low. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm peak is something else. Let's see. The integral is 2H. If it's not NH2, what else? Maybe a CH2 group next to an oxygen. But the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. If it's a CH2, why is it broad? Maybe it's an NH2 that's exchanging. 

Alternatively, maybe the structure has an amide group. For example, if it's phenylacetamide ethyl ester. Wait, but that might not fit the molecular formula. Let me check. Phenylacetamide would be C6H5CH2CONH2. Adding an ethyl ester would replace the -OH of the acid, but phenylacetamide is already an amide. Wait, no. If it's the ethyl ester of a benzamide, like benzoyl ethyl ester with an amide. Wait, maybe benzamide ethyl ester? That would be NH2CO-O-C6H4-COOEt? No, that's too many groups. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a carbamate. A carbamate has the structure O=C(NR2)-O-. For example, ethyl carbamate is NH2CO-OEt. But that would have the formula C3H7NO2. Not matching. 

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-lactam, but that's probably more complex. 

Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a side chain. Let me think again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If there's a benzene ring (6C), an ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3, 3C), that's 9C. Wait, 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) = 9. Then the nitrogen must be in the benzene ring. So it's a benzene ring with an NH2 group and a COOEt group in para positions. That gives the formula C9H11NO2. Yes. So the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. 

In that case, the NH2 protons would be on the benzene ring. However, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is part of the aromatic amine. The protons on the NH2 would typically appear as a broad peak, possibly around 4-6 ppm. But in practice, I've seen that aromatic amines like aniline have NH2 protons around 3.5-5 ppm as broad peaks, depending on concentration and solvent. So 4.0 ppm could be possible. 

The aromatic protons would be two doublets. The ones adjacent to the NH2 (electron-donating) would be upfield (7.0 ppm), and those adjacent to the ester (electron-withdrawing) would be downfield (8.0 ppm). That matches the NMR data. 

The IR would show N-H stretches (3420 and 3325 cm-1) for the NH2 group, and the ester carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. That all fits. 

So putting it all together, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, also known as benzocaine. Benzocaine is a local anesthetic with the structure NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. 

Let me verify the molecular formula: C6 (benzene) + COOEt (C3H5O2). Wait, COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3, which is 2 oxygen atoms. The formula would be C6H5NH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, the benzene ring has 6 carbons, the COOEt is 3 carbons (COO- is two oxygens, but the carbons are the carbonyl and the ethyl). Wait, let's count again. Benzene (6C) + COOEt (1C from COO, 2C from ethyl) = 6 + 1 + 2 = 9C. Nitrogen is in the NH2 group (1N). Oxygens: two from the ester (COO) and one from the ester oxygen (O), but wait, the ester is O=C-O-CH2CH3, so three oxygens? No, the ester group is O=C-O-; that's two oxygens in the carbonyl and the ester oxygen. So total oxygens: 2 (from COO) + 1 (from NH2?) No, the NH2 is part of the amine. So the oxygens are from the ester: COO has two oxygens, and the ester linkage has one oxygen (the O in OCH2CH3). Wait, no: the ester is R-O-CO-R', so the oxygen from the R-O and the carbonyl oxygen. So the ester group has two oxygen atoms: one in the carbonyl and one in the ether linkage. So total oxygens in the molecule: 2 (from COO) and one from the NH2? No, NH2 doesn't have oxygen. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So two oxygens. The ester group contributes two oxygens (COO), and that's it. So that matches the molecular formula. 

Yes, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine) has the formula C9H11NO2. The IR matches with NH2 stretches and ester carbonyl. The NMR matches with ethyl group signals, aromatic protons as two doublets, and the NH2 as a broad singlet. Therefore, the compound is benzocaine.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out what compound has the formula C9H11NO2 based on the IR and NMR data provided. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step. 

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Plugging in the numbers: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. Assuming X (halogens) is 0. So that's (2*9 + 2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (18 +2 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean five rings, but that's unlikely. More probably, it's a combination of double bonds and rings. Each double bond or ring is one degree. Each triple bond is two. So maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) plus a double bond and a ring? Hmm, but benzene is three, and maybe a carbonyl (which is a double bond) and an amide or something else. Let me think.

Looking at the IR data: medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So possible ester, ketone, amide, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch around 3000, which isn't mentioned here. The N-H stretches are two peaks, which might suggest an amide (usually two peaks for NH2), but amides have carbonyls too. Wait, but amides have carbonyls around 1650-1700 cm-1. The 1720 cm-1 is more towards an ester or maybe a ketone. But the presence of N-H stretches might indicate that the carbonyl is part of an amide. Wait, maybe it's an ester and an amide? Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe the 3420 and 3325 are from an amine. Primary amines have two N-H stretches, but they are usually a bit lower in wavenumber. Secondary amines have one, but maybe if there's some hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, maybe those are O-H stretches, but they would be broader. The problem states medium to strong intensity, so maybe they're not O-H. So maybe it's an amide. But the carbonyl is at 1720, which is higher than typical amides. Wait, amides are usually around 1650-1700. Esters and ketones are higher. So maybe the carbonyl is an ester, and the N-H is from an amine group. Let's hold that thought.

Now looking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: This is likely a methyl group (3H) split into a triplet. A triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Methyl groups adjacent to a CH2 would give a triplet if the CH2 is split by another group. For example, an ethyl group (CH2CH3) where the CH2 is split, making the methyl a triplet. Wait, in an ethyl group (like in an ester, ethyl acetate), the CH3 would be a triplet if the adjacent CH2 is split by something. But in ethyl acetate, the methyl is a triplet when the adjacent CH2 is split by the oxygen. Wait, actually, in ethyl groups, the methyl is usually a triplet when next to a CH2 that is split by another group. Alternatively, maybe the 1.20 ppm is a methyl adjacent to an oxygen? Wait, but in ethyl esters, the CH2 next to the oxygen is usually around 4.0-4.5 ppm, as a quartet. Let's check the other peaks.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: A broad singlet with 2H. Broad signals are often due to exchange, like NH or OH protons. But here, the integration is 2H. If it's NH2, that could be an amine. But in the IR we saw N-H stretches. If it's an NH2 group, maybe in an amide. But amides usually have NH protons that are downfield. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. Wait, 4.0 is also the region for CH2 groups next to oxygen. But if it's a broad singlet, maybe it's an NH2 that's exchanging. But 4.0 ppm seems a bit upfield for an NH2. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2O- group? Not sure. Let me think.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: Quartet (four peaks) for 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with three neighbors, but since it's 2H, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH3. For example, in an ethyl group (CH2CH3), the CH2 would be a quartet if the adjacent CH3 is split. Wait, but that would be if the CH3 is split by the CH2. Wait, in an ethyl group, the CH2 is next to the CH3. If the CH2 is split by the CH3, the CH2 would be a quartet. But in an ethyl ester, the oxygen is adjacent. For example, in ethyl acetate, the CH2 next to the oxygen is a quartet around 4.1 ppm. The methyl is a triplet at around 1.2 ppm. So that matches the 1.20 triplet (3H) and the 4.5 quartet (2H). So maybe that's an ethyl ester group: OCH2CH3. So the 4.5 ppm quartet would be the OCH2, and the 1.20 triplet is the CH3

# Anthropic completion

I'll analyze what compound matches the formula C9H11NO2 using the IR and NMR data.

First, I'll calculate the degree of unsaturation with the formula (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. With C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2, and X=0, we get (2×9 + 2 - 11 - 0 + 1)/2 = (18 + 2 - 11 + 1)/2 = 10/2 = 5 degrees of unsaturation. This likely represents a combination of rings and double bonds rather than five separate rings.

The IR data shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, probably indicating N-H stretches from an amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. This is higher than typical amide carbonyls (1650-1700 cm-1), pointing more toward an ester or ketone. The combination suggests we might have both an amine group and an ester functionality.

Examining the NMR data:
- The 1.20 ppm triplet integrating for 3H likely represents a methyl group adjacent to a CH2, such as in an ethyl group (CH2CH3).
- The 4.0 ppm broad singlet for 2H could be an NH2 group exhibiting exchange, though this chemical shift is somewhat upfield for an amine. Alternatively, it might be related to a CH2 near an oxygen.
- The 4.5 ppm quartet integrating for 2H suggests a CH2 group split by three neighboring protons, consistent with a CH2 adjacent to a CH3 in an ethyl ester (OCH2CH3).

The pattern of the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) and 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) strongly suggests an ethyl ester group, where the 4.5 ppm signal represents the OCH2 and the 1.20 ppm signal is the CH3.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to identify the compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the IR and NMR data provided. Let me break down the information step by step.

Starting with the molecular formula C9H11NO2, I'll calculate the degree of unsaturation using the formula (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Plug in the numbers: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2, and assume X (halogens) is 0. So that's (2*9 + 2 - 11 - 0 + 1)/2 = (18 + 2 - 11 + 1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. Thus, there are five degrees of unsaturation, which could mean five rings, but that's unlikely. It's more likely a mix of double bonds and rings. Each double bond or ring represents one degree of unsaturation, with triple bonds counting as two. It might be a benzene ring (3 degrees) with a double bond and a ring, or perhaps a benzene (3 degrees) and a carbonyl (a double bond), possibly involved in an amide or another structure. Let me consider further.

The IR data shows medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹, likely N-H stretches from an amine or amide. The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, pointing to a potential ester, ketone, amide, or maybe a carboxylic acid. However, a carboxylic acid would feature a broad O-H stretch around 3000 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here. The N-H stretches split into two peaks, suggesting an amide (often having two peaks for NH2); however, amides also have carbonyls around 1650-1700 cm⁻¹. The 1720 cm⁻¹ position leans towards an ester or perhaps a ketone. But the N-H stretches suggest that the carbonyl could be part of an amide. Perhaps it's an ester and an amide? Let me see.

Another possibility is that the 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ bands are from an amine. Primary amines have two N-H stretches, usually lower in wavenumber. Secondary amines have one, possibly shifting due to hydrogen bonding. O-H stretches would be broader, and the data indicates medium to strong intensity, which may not fit O-H. So it might be an amide. However, the carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹ is higher than typical amides, which are usually around 1650-1700 cm⁻¹. Esters and ketones fit the higher range. So possibly, the carbonyl is an ester, and the N-H is from an amine group. Let's hold that thought.

Now onto the NMR data. Here are the peaks:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: Likely a methyl group (3H) split into a triplet, suggesting coupling with two neighboring protons. Methyl groups next to a CH2 often show a triplet if the CH2 is split by another group, such as in an ethyl group (CH2CH3). In an ethyl ester like ethyl acetate, the CH3 is a triplet when the adjacent CH2 is split by the oxygen. Wait, in ethyl groups, the methyl is often a triplet when adjacent to a CH2 split by another group. Alternatively, perhaps the 1.20 ppm methyl is adjacent to an oxygen? In ethyl esters, though, the CH2 near the oxygen is typically around 4.0-4.5 ppm, appearing as a quartet. Let's review the other peaks.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: This broad singlet is 2H. Broad signals can arise from exchangeable protons like NH or OH, but this is 2H, indicating a possible amine. If it were an amide, NH2 groups might be present, but these protons would typically show up further downfield. However, at 4.0 ppm, it could also indicate CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen. Because it’s a broad singlet, it might be an exchanging NH2 group, yet 4.0 ppm seems upfield for NH2. Alternatively, this could represent an -OCH2O- group, though it requires more consideration.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: A quartet, indicating four peaks for 2H, might suggest coupling with three adjacent hydrogens. A CH2 neighboring a CH3 (as in an ethyl group) could result in this pattern if the CH2 is split by the CH3. In an ethyl ester, like ethyl acetate, the CH2 next to the oxygen is a quartet around 4.1 ppm. Meanwhile, the methyl appears as a triplet around 1.2 ppm. These observations align with the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) and the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H), suggesting an ethyl ester group: OCH2CH3. Therefore, the 4.5 ppm quartet would correspond to the OCH2, and the 1.20 ppm triplet to the CH3.

So that suggests an ethyl ester group. Then the carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 in the IR would be the ester carbonyl. That makes sense. So we have an ethyl ester, which contributes COOCH2CH3. Then the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: COOCH2CH3 is C3H6O2. So the remaining part would be C6H5N. Wait, but the total formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check: COOCH2CH3 is O2C-O-CH2CH3, which is (COO) + (CH2CH3) = C(2+2) O2 + H5? Wait, COOCH2CH3 is C4H8O2. Wait, maybe I need to recount. The ester group is RCOOCH2CH3. The R here would be a substituent. Let's see, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If the ester is RCOOCH2CH3, then R would be C7H10NO. Wait, that can't be. Wait, the ester group is OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), so the rest of the molecule is C8H8NO2. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's subtract the ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3). COOCH2CH3 has 2 carbons (from COO) and 2 carbons from ethyl, total 4 carbons. Wait, no: the ester is RCOOCH2CH3, so R is a substituent. Let me think: the entire molecule is RCOOCH2CH3, and the formula is C9H11NO2. So RCOOCH2CH3 would have (n + 3) carbons, where n is R. Wait, RCOO is (n+2) carbons. Wait, maybe R is C7H10N? Hmm, maybe that's not the way. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is an ethyl ester of a substituted benzoic acid with an amino group. For example, ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's check the formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's the ethyl ester, then C7H5O2 (from benzoic acid minus H) plus OCH2CH3 (which is C2H5O), so total C9H10O3. But the formula given is C9H11NO2. So that's not matching. Wait, but if there's an amino group substituting the benzene ring, then maybe replacing a hydrogen with NH2. So para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing a H with NH2 gives C7H7NO2. Then as ethyl ester, adding OCH2CH3 (which is C2H5O), so total C9H12NO3. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe it's not benzoic acid but another aromatic acid.\n\nWait, let's count the carbons again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If there's an ethyl ester group (OCH2CH3), that's 2 carbons. The remaining part would be C7H8NO. Let's see, perhaps a phenyl group (C6H5) attached to a carbonyl (O) and an NH2 group. For example, phenylacetamide? But with an ethyl ester? Wait, maybe it's a benzamide. Wait, maybe the structure is something like ethyl 4-aminobenzoate? Let's check the formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ethyl ester would be C7H5O2 (from benzoic acid) plus OCH2CH3 (C2H5O), so total C9H10O3. But we need C9H11NO2. So replacing an oxygen with NH2? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's an amino group in the ring. Let's think about the NMR.\n\nIn the NMR, we have 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets each integrating for 2H suggest two pairs of protons that are coupled to each other, which is typical for para-substituted benzene. For example, in para-substituted benzene derivatives, the protons ortho to the substituent are deshielded and appear downfield, while the meta protons are shielded. Wait, but in the case of two substituents, but if it's monosubstituted, then the para positions would be equivalent. Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents that are para to each other? Wait, no, if there's one substituent, then the ring has two sets of protons: the two ortho to the substituent and the two meta. But maybe in this case, the substituent is in the para position, leading to two doublets. Wait, actually, for a para-substituted benzene with electron-withdrawing groups, the protons ortho and para to the substituent would be deshielded. Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, no, the integrals add up to 4H (2H each), so the benzene ring has four protons, which would be the case if there are two substituents in para positions. Wait, but a benzene ring has six carbons. If there are two substituents, each in para positions, then the remaining four protons would be in the ortho and meta positions. But in that case, maybe the coupling would be different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitro group and another substituent. Wait, but the molecular formula has one nitrogen. Let me check.\n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that would account for the NO2, but the formula has one N and two O's. Wait, the nitro group is NO2, which would take one N and two O's. But then the rest would be C9H11. Wait, but the problem states the formula is C9H11NO2, so maybe there's an amide or amine group. Alternatively, maybe the oxygen count is from an ester and an amide. Let me think again.\n\nThe IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. If it's an ester, then we have an OCH2CH3 group. The ethyl group would account for the triplet at 1.20 and the quartet at 4.5. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) might be an NH2 group. The aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm as doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. Putting this all together, perhaps it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's check the formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ethyl ester would add OCH2CH3, making C9H10O3. But the compound here is C9H11NO2. So replacing an oxygen with NH2? Wait, no. Wait, but if the substituent on the benzene ring is NH2, then the formula would be C7H7NO2 as the acid, and then adding ethyl ester (C2H5O), so total C9H12NO3. Hmm, not matching. Wait, maybe the substituent is an NH2 group and another group. Wait, but the molecular formula only has one N. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not a benzoate ester. Let's consider other possibilities. Suppose the carbonyl is an amide. The IR at 1720 cm-1 is a bit high for an amide, but maybe it's an acetylated amide or something. Wait, but the NH2 would be in the NMR. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be NH2. If it's an amide, then maybe the structure is something like phenylacetamide ethyl ester? Wait, not sure. Let me look at the NMR again.\n\nThe aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That's two doublets integrating to 2H each, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but how? If there are two substituents on the benzene ring in para positions, like two groups opposite each other, then the remaining four protons would be in two pairs. For example, if you have substituents in the para positions, then the adjacent protons (ortho to substituents) would be equivalent. Wait, actually, if there's one substituent, the para positions would have equivalent protons. Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, causing the ortho and para protons to split into doublets. Wait, perhaps it's a nitro group para to another group. But the molecular formula only has one N. Alternatively, it's a carbonyl group attached to the benzene, like in acetophenone. But then the carbonyl is already accounted for by the ester. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the benzene ring has an ester group and an amino group in the para position. So, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's check the formula. The benzoic acid part would be C7H7NO2 (since replacing a H with NH2). Adding the ethyl ester (OCH2CH3) gives C9H11NO3. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one oxygen too many. Hmm. So that can't be. Wait, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. If the structure is ethyl 4-(aminocarbonyl)benzoate. Wait, but that would have two carbonyl groups. Let's see: the ester is COOEt, and the amide is CONH2. Then the formula would be C9H10N2O3. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene ring, and the ester is in the para position. So, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Wait, but as before, the formula would be C9H11NO3. Hmm. Maybe there's a different substitution. Let me think about the NMR again.\n\nThe aromatic protons at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. If the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group like nitro, the protons ortho and para would be deshielded. But in this case, maybe the substituent is an ester group (COOEt) in the para position, and another substituent which is an amino group. Wait, but that would require two substituents. Let me check the formula again. If the molecule is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would be O\n\nWait, perhaps the compound is phenacetin, which is an analgesic. Let me check. Phenacetin is p-ethoxy acetanilide. Its structure is a benzene ring with an ethoxy group and an acetanilide group (NHCOCH3). But the molecular formula of phenacetin is C10H13NO2. Close, but not quite. Our compound is C9H11NO2. So maybe it's a similar structure but with one less carbon. Alternatively, maybe it's ethyl phenylcarbamate. Carbamate would have an OCONH2 group. Let's see. The formula for ethyl phenylcarbamate would be C9H11NO3. Still an extra oxygen. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think about the NMR again. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) is likely an NH2 group. Then, the ethyl ester group (1.20 triplet, 4.5 quartet). The aromatic protons as two doublets. So putting this together, maybe the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Even though the formula seems off, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.\n\nBenzoic acid is C7H6O2. If we replace one H with NH2, the formula becomes C7H7NO2. Then, making the ethyl ester would add OCH2CH3 (which is C2H5O). So combining, the ester would be C7H7NO2 + C2H5O = C9H12NO3. But our compound is C9H11NO2. So we are missing one H and one O. Hmm. Maybe the NH2 is not on the benzene ring but elsewhere. Wait, but the aromatic protons are in the NMR, so the benzene ring is present. Maybe the NH2 is part of an amide linked to the benzene ring. For example, ethyl 4-(2-aminoacetoxy)benzoate? That might complicate things, but the formula would be more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is ethyl 3-aminobenzoate. Let's check. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding NH2 would make C7H7NO2. Then ethyl ester is C2H5O. Total C9H12NO3. Still not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the carbonyl is not an ester. The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1. If it's a ketone, but then where is the N? Alternatively, maybe it's a carbamate. Carbamates have a carbonyl group and an NH2. The structure would be O=C(OEt)NH2. But that would be ethyl carbamate, which is C3H7NO2. But our compound is C9H11NO2, so there's a benzene ring involved. Maybe it's a phenyl carbamate. Phenyl carbamate would be O=C(OEt)NHPh. Then the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check: phenyl group (C6H5), carbamate group (O=C(OEt)NH-). So O=C(OCH2CH3)NH-C6H5. That would be C6H5NHCOOCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: 6 (Ph) + 1 (N) + 2 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 11? Wait, no. Wait, C6H5 is 6 carbons, the carbamate is O=C(OCH2CH3)NH-. So the carbamate part is N-C-O-C-O-CH2CH3. Wait, the formula would be C6H5NHCOOCH2CH3. So carbamate is NHCOOCH2CH3. The carbons: 6 (Ph) + 1 (N) + 1 (C from COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 6+1+1+2=10? No. Wait, the carbamate is O=C(NH-O-CH2CH3)-O-. Wait, maybe better to count each atom:\n\nC6H5 (6C) + N (1N) + C (from carbonyl) + O2 + CH2CH3 (2C). So total C: 6 +1 +2=9. Yes! So C6H5-NH-CO-O-CH2CH3. That's 6 (Ph) + 1 (N) + 1 (CO) + 2 (OCH2CH3) = 10? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's count:\n\nPhenyl group: 6C\n\nNH: 1N\n\nCOO: 2O and 1C\n\nEthyl group (OCH2CH3): 2C and 1O\n\nSo total C: 6 +1 (from COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 9C. Yes.\n\nHydrogens: phenyl (5H, since one H is replaced) + NH (1H) + OCH2CH3 (5H) + COO (no H). Wait, phenyl has 5H (if substituted once), NH (assuming it's NH, but carbamate is OCONHR, so R is phenyl. The structure would be O=C(OCH2CH3)NHPh. So the NH is part of the carbamate. Let's count H:\n\nPh group: 5H\n\nNH: 1H\n\nOCH2CH3: 5H (CH2CH3 has 5H? No, ethyl group is CH2CH3, which has 5H: two on CH2 and three on CH3. Wait, OCH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H. Then carbonyl group: O=C(OCH2CH3)NHPh. The NH would have one H. So total H: 5 (Ph) +1 (NH) +5 (OCH2CH3) = 11 H. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check: C: 6 (Ph) + 2 (OCH2CH3) +1 (CO) = 9. N:1. O: 3 (from COO and OCH2CH3). Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which has two O's. But the carbamate would have three O's: one from carbonyl, two from the ester (OCH2CH3 and the oxygen connecting to the NH). Hmm, that's a problem. So this structure would have three O's, but the formula has two. So that can't be. So maybe that's not the right structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's an amide. Let's say ethyl phenylacetamide. Structure: Ph-CH2-CONH-OEt? Not sure. Wait, maybe the amide is attached to the benzene ring. For example, ethyl 4-acetamidobenzoate. But that would have more oxygen atoms. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's subtract the ethyl ester (OCH2CH3), which is 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen. So remaining is C7H6NO. Then, we have a benzene ring (C6H5), so remaining is C1H1NO. Hmm. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl ester is not part of an aromatic system. Wait, but the NMR shows aromatic protons, so the benzene ring is present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is a benzamide with an ethyl group. For example, N-ethylbenzamide. Structure: Ph-CONH-CH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check: Benzamide is C7H7NO (Ph-CONH2). Replacing NH2 with NHCH2CH3 adds one C and two H, so C8H9NO. Wait, no. Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2? Wait, benzamide is PhCONH2, which is C7H7NO2. Then N-ethylbenzamide would be PhCONHCH2CH3, which is C9H11NO2. Yes! That matches the molecular formula. Let's check the spectral data.\n\nIR: The carbonyl (amide) would be around 1650-1680 cm-1, but the IR here shows 1720 cm-1. Hmm, discrepancy. Amides have lower carbonyl stretches than esters. So maybe that's a problem. Also, the NH in the amide would be a stretch around 3300 cm-1, which matches the given IR peaks (3420 and 3325). But the carbonyl is too high for an amide. Maybe it's an ester and an amide?\n\nWait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If it's N-ethylbenzamide, then the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check the NMR:\n\n1.20 ppm triplet (3H) would be the CH3 of the ethyl group attached to the nitrogen. The NH would be a broad peak. The ethyl group attached to N would have the CH2 next to N. In N-ethyl groups, the CH2 is usually around 3.3 ppm as a quartet, but maybe if it's adjacent to an amide, it could be deshielded. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is more like an OCH2. So that might not fit. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be the NH2, but in N-ethylbenzamide, the NH is a single proton (NHCH2CH3), which would be a singlet, but maybe broad. However, the integration is 2H here. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not N-ethylbenzamide.\n\nBack to the drawing board. Let's consider the ethyl ester group (from the NMR: 1.20 triplet, 4.5 quartet). Then, the carbonyl is an ester at 1720 cm-1. The remaining parts are a benzene ring with substituents that include an NH2 group. The benzene ring has two doublets, suggesting para substitution. So maybe the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Even though earlier calculation suggested the formula might not match, let's check again.\n\nBenzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing one H with NH2 gives C7H7NO2. Then, making the ethyl ester adds OCH2CH3 (which is C2H5O). So total formula would be C7H7NO2 + C2H5O = C9H12NO3. But our compound is C9H11NO2. So we have an extra O and H. Hmm. Wait, maybe the NH2 is replacing an O? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is not benzoic acid but another acid. Let me think.\n\nWait, what if the benzene ring is not part of the ester but is attached to an amide? For example, ethyl 4-aminophenylacetate. Structure: CH2COOEt attached to a benzene ring with an NH2 group. But then the formula would be C6H5NH2CH2COOEt. Let's count: benzene (6C), NH2 (1N), CH2COOEt (4C, since COOEt is 3C: COO is 2C and Et is 2C, but CH2 is another C). Wait, maybe:\n\nPh-NH2-CH2-COOEt. That would be 6 (Ph) + 1 (CH2) + 3 (COOEt) = 10C. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is ethyl 4-amino-3-nitrobenzoate. But that would add more oxygens and nitrogens. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the NH2 is not on the benzene ring. Let's see. If the benzene ring is part of the ester (like in ethyl benzoate), and there's an additional NH2 group somewhere else. For example, ethyl benzoate with an NH2 group on the ethyl chain. But ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Adding an NH2 would make it C9H11NO2. That fits the formula. So maybe ethyl 2-amino benzoate? Wait, no. Wait, if the NH2 is on the ethyl group. For example, ethyl glycinate benzoate? Not sure. Wait, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. If one of the CH2 hydrogens is replaced by NH2, making OCH2NH2CH3. But that would be a different structure. Alternatively, the NH2 is part of a separate group. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is phenylethylamine with an ester. Wait, phenylethylamine is C8H11N. Adding an ester group (COO) would require more oxygens. Maybe not.\n\nWait, let's try to piece it together:\n\n- Ethyl ester group: COOCH2CH3 (from NMR and IR)\n- Benzene ring with para substituents (from NMR: 7.0 and 8.0 ppm doublets)\n- NH2 group (from IR and NMR 4.0 ppm)\n\nSo putting this together, the structure could be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Even though the formula seems off, maybe my initial calculation was wrong. Let me recount:\n\n4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2 (benzoic acid C7H6O2 minus one H plus NH2). Then, as ethyl ester, it would be C7H7NO2 + C2H5O- (from esterification). Wait, esterification replaces the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH2CH3. So the molecular formula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C7H7NO2 (acid) minus H2O (from esterification) plus C2H5O. Wait, esterification is: RCOOH + HOCH2CH3 → RCOOCH2CH3 + H2O. So the formula of the ester is (RCOOCH2CH3) where R is the rest of the acid. So the acid is 4-aminobenzoic acid: C7H7NO2. The ester would then be C7H7NO2 - H2O + C2H5OH. Wait, no. The molecular formula of the ester is (C7H6NO2)(COOCH2CH3). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's do it step by step.\n\n4-aminobenzoic acid: C7H7NO2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, replacing one H with NH2).\n\nEsterification with ethanol (C2H5OH) would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH2CH3. So the ester would be C7H7NO2 - (OH) + (OCH2CH3).\n\nOH is H1O1, OCH2CH3 is C2H5O1.\n\nSo subtracting H1O1 and adding C2H5O1:\n\nC: 7 + 2 = 9\n\nH: 7 (from acid) -1 (from OH) +5 (from OCH2CH3) = 11\n\nN:1\n\nO:2 (from acid) -1 (from OH) +1 (from OCH2CH3) = 2\n\nSo the formula is C9H11NO2. Yes! That matches. So ethyl 4-aminobenzoate has the correct molecular formula. Earlier miscalculation was my mistake. So this compound fits.\n\nNow check the spectral data:\n\nIR: The NH2 group would have N-H stretches at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which matches the given IR. The ester carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 is correct.\n\nNMR:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl CH3, adjacent to OCH2, so triplet.\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 of the ethyl group, quartet.\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2 group, broad singlet due to exchange broadening.\n- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets correspond to the protons ortho and meta to the substituents. In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is para to the ester group. The amino group is electron-donating, which usually shields the ortho protons, but in this case, the ester is electron-withdrawing. Wait, the ester group is in the para position to the amino group. The amino group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to the amino group would be deshielded (downfield), and the protons meta to the amino group (which are ortho to the ester) would also be deshielded. Hmm, maybe the coupling is between the two sets of protons. Alternatively, in para-substituted benzene rings with two different substituents, the coupling can lead to specific patterns. However, in this case, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt in para positions. The NH2 is electron-donating, causing the adjacent protons (ortho to NH2) to be deshielded and appear downfield. The COOEt is electron-withdrawing, causing its adjacent protons (ortho to COOEt) to be deshielded and also downfield. But since they are para to each other, the protons adjacent to NH2 are ortho to NH2 and meta to COOEt, and vice versa. This might result in two distinct doublets. The actual chemical shifts depend on the substituents. The amino group's protons might be at lower ppm (around 7.0) and the ester's protons at higher ppm (around 8.0). Alternatively, the reverse. Let me check typical shifts.\n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is para to the ester. The amino group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it are deshielded and appear downfield. The ester group is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it are also deshielded. But since they are para, the two sets of protons are across from each other. So each pair of protons is adjacent to one substituent and across from the other. The actual shifts can vary, but typically, the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing group (ester) would be more downfield. So the protons next to the ester (ortho to COOEt) would be around 8.0 ppm, and those next to the NH2 (ortho to NH2) around 7.0 ppm. This matches the NMR data given: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). The coupling between the two sets of protons would result in each being a doublet.\n\nThe NH2 protons are at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. Wait, but NH2 protons are usually around 5-6 ppm, but in aromatic amines, they can be downfield shifted. However, in this case, the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine (aniline derivative), which typically has NH2 protons around 5 ppm as a broad peak. But the given data shows the NH2 at 4.0 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's because of the para electron-withdrawing group (ester) which deshields the NH2 protons, causing them to appear upfield? Or perhaps there's some hydrogen bonding or exchange with the solvent. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide, but in this structure, it's a free amine. Alternatively, maybe the sample is in DMSO-d6, which can cause shifts, but the question doesn't specify the solvent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but another proton. But with integration 2H, and the IR showing N-H stretches, it's likely NH2. The shift might be due to the para substituent. Or perhaps it's an alcohol, but the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch. \n\nOverall, despite the slight discrepancy in the NH2 shift, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate seems to fit the data best. Let me confirm the coupling in the aromatic region. For a para-disubstituted benzene with two different groups, the protons can be split into two doublets if the substituents have different electronic effects. The coupling constant between the two sets of protons (ortho to each substituent) would be around 8-9 Hz. The integration of 2H each suggests that each doublet corresponds to two equivalent protons. This matches the expected pattern for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nThus, putting it all together, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386421, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7356, prompt_tokens=1378, total_tokens=8734, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

. So that suggests an ethyl ester group. Then the carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 in the IR would be the ester carbonyl. That makes sense. So we have an ethyl ester, which contributes COOCH2CH3. Then the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: COOCH2CH3 is C3H6O2. So the remaining part would be C6H5N. Wait, but the total formula is C9H11NO2. Let me check: COOCH2CH3 is O2C-O-CH2CH3, which is (COO) + (CH2CH3) = C(2+2) O2 + H5? Wait, COOCH2CH3 is C4H8O2. Wait, maybe I need to recount. The ester group is RCOOCH2CH3. The R here would be a substituent. Let's see, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If the ester is RCOOCH2CH3, then R would be C7H10NO. Wait, that can't be. Wait, the ester group is OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), so the rest of the molecule is C8H8NO2. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's subtract the ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3). COOCH2CH3 has 2 carbons (from COO) and 2 carbons from ethyl, total 4 carbons. Wait, no: the ester is RCOOCH2CH3, so R is a substituent. Let me think: the entire molecule is RCOOCH2CH3, and the formula is C9H11NO2. So RCOOCH2CH3 would have (n + 3) carbons, where n is R. Wait, RCOO is (n+2) carbons. Wait, maybe R is C7H10N? Hmm, maybe that's not the way. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ethyl ester of a substituted benzoic acid with an amino group. For example, ethyl para-aminobenzoate. Let's check the formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's the ethyl ester, then C7H5O2 (from benzoic acid minus H) plus OCH2CH3 (which is C2H5O), so total C9H10O3. But the formula given is C9H11NO2. So that's not matching. Wait, but if there's an amino group substituting the benzene ring, then maybe replacing a hydrogen with NH2. So para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing a H with NH2 gives C7H7NO2. Then as ethyl ester, adding OCH2CH3 (which is C2H5O), so total C9H12NO3. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe it's not benzoic acid but another aromatic acid.

Wait, let's count the carbons again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If there's an ethyl ester group (OCH2CH3), that's 2 carbons. The remaining part would be C7H8NO. Let's see, perhaps a phenyl group (C6H5) attached to a carbonyl (O) and an NH2 group. For example, phenylacetamide? But with an ethyl ester? Wait, maybe it's a benzamide. Wait, maybe the structure is something like ethyl 4-aminobenzoate? Let's check the formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ethyl ester would be C7H5O2 (from benzoic acid) plus OCH2CH3 (C2H5O), so total C9H10O3. But we need C9H11NO2. So replacing an oxygen with NH2? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's an amino group in the ring. Let's think about the NMR.

In the NMR, we have 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets each integrating for 2H suggest two pairs of protons that are coupled to each other, which is typical for para-substituted benzene. For example, in para-substituted benzene derivatives, the protons ortho to the substituent are deshielded and appear downfield, while the meta protons are shielded. Wait, but in the case of two substituents, but if it's monosubstituted, then the para positions would be equivalent. Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents that are para to each other? Wait, no, if there's one substituent, then the ring has two sets of protons: the two ortho to the substituent and the two meta. But maybe in this case, the substituent is in the para position, leading to two doublets. Wait, actually, for a para-substituted benzene with electron-withdrawing groups, the protons ortho and para to the substituent would be deshielded. Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, no, the integrals add up to 4H (2H each), so the benzene ring has four protons, which would be the case if there are two substituents in para positions. Wait, but a benzene ring has six carbons. If there are two substituents, each in para positions, then the remaining four protons would be in the ortho and meta positions. But in that case, maybe the coupling would be different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitro group and another substituent. Wait, but the molecular formula has one nitrogen. Let me check.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If there's a nitro group (NO2), that would account for the NO2, but the formula has one N and two O's. Wait, the nitro group is NO2, which would take one N and two O's. But then the rest would be C9H11. Wait, but the problem states the formula is C9H11NO2, so maybe there's an amide or amine group. Alternatively, maybe the oxygen count is from an ester and an amide. Let me think again.

The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. If it's an ester, then we have an OCH2CH3 group. The ethyl group would account for the triplet at 1.20 and the quartet at 4.5. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) might be an NH2 group. The aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm as doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. Putting this all together, perhaps it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's check the formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. The ethyl ester would add OCH2CH3, making C9H10O3. But the compound here is C9H11NO2. So replacing an oxygen with NH2? Wait, no. Wait, but if the substituent on the benzene ring is NH2, then the formula would be C7H7NO2 as the acid, and then adding ethyl ester (C2H5O), so total C9H12NO3. Hmm, not matching. Wait, maybe the substituent is an NH2 group and another group. Wait, but the molecular formula only has one N. Let me try again.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a benzoate ester. Let's consider other possibilities. Suppose the carbonyl is an amide. The IR at 1720 cm-1 is a bit high for an amide, but maybe it's an acetylated amide or something. Wait, but the NH2 would be in the NMR. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be NH2. If it's an amide, then maybe the structure is something like phenylacetamide ethyl ester? Wait, not sure. Let me look at the NMR again.

The aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That's two doublets integrating to 2H each, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but how? If there are two substituents on the benzene ring in para positions, like two groups opposite each other, then the remaining four protons would be in two pairs. For example, if you have substituents in the para positions, then the adjacent protons (ortho to substituents) would be equivalent. Wait, actually, if there's one substituent, the para positions would have equivalent protons. Wait, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group, causing the ortho and para protons to split into doublets. Wait, perhaps it's a nitro group para to another group. But the molecular formula only has one N. Alternatively, it's a carbonyl group attached to the benzene, like in acetophenone. But then the carbonyl is already accounted for by the ester. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the benzene ring has an ester group and an amino group in the para position. So, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's check the formula. The benzoic acid part would be C7H7NO2 (since replacing a H with NH2). Adding the ethyl ester (OCH2CH3) gives C9H11NO3. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one oxygen too many. Hmm. So that can't be. Wait, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. If the structure is ethyl 4-(aminocarbonyl)benzoate. Wait, but that would have two carbonyl groups. Let's see: the ester is COOEt, and the amide is CONH2. Then the formula would be C9H10N2O3. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene ring, and the ester is in the para position. So, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Wait, but as before, the formula would be C9H11NO3. Hmm. Maybe there's a different substitution. Let me think about the NMR again.

The aromatic protons at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. If the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group like nitro, the protons ortho and para would be deshielded. But in this case, maybe the substituent is an ester group (COOEt) in the para position, and another substituent which is an amino group. Wait, but that would require two substituents. Let me check the formula again. If the molecule is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would be O

Wait, perhaps the compound is phenacetin, which is an analgesic. Let me check. Phenacetin is p-ethoxy acetanilide. Its structure is a benzene ring with an ethoxy group and an acetanilide group (NHCOCH3). But the molecular formula of phenacetin is C10H13NO2. Close, but not quite. Our compound is C9H11NO2. So maybe it's a similar structure but with one less carbon. Alternatively, maybe it's ethyl phenylcarbamate. Carbamate would have an OCONH2 group. Let's see. The formula for ethyl phenylcarbamate would be C9H11NO3. Still an extra oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) is likely an NH2 group. Then, the ethyl ester group (1.20 triplet, 4.5 quartet). The aromatic protons as two doublets. So putting this together, maybe the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Even though the formula seems off, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If we replace one H with NH2, the formula becomes C7H7NO2. Then, making the ethyl ester would add OCH2CH3 (which is C2H5O). So combining, the ester would be C7H7NO2 + C2H5O = C9H12NO3. But our compound is C9H11NO2. So we are missing one H and one O. Hmm. Maybe the NH2 is not on the benzene ring but elsewhere. Wait, but the aromatic protons are in the NMR, so the benzene ring is present. Maybe the NH2 is part of an amide linked to the benzene ring. For example, ethyl 4-(2-aminoacetoxy)benzoate? That might complicate things, but the formula would be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is ethyl 3-aminobenzoate. Let's check. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding NH2 would make C7H7NO2. Then ethyl ester is C2H5O. Total C9H12NO3. Still not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the carbonyl is not an ester. The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm-1. If it's a ketone, but then where is the N? Alternatively, maybe it's a carbamate. Carbamates have a carbonyl group and an NH2. The structure would be O=C(OEt)NH2. But that would be ethyl carbamate, which is C3H7NO2. But our compound is C9H11NO2, so there's a benzene ring involved. Maybe it's a phenyl carbamate. Phenyl carbamate would be O=C(OEt)NHPh. Then the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check: phenyl group (C6H5), carbamate group (O=C(OEt)NH-). So O=C(OCH2CH3)NH-C6H5. That would be C6H5NHCOOCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: 6 (Ph) + 1 (N) + 2 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 11? Wait, no. Wait, C6H5 is 6 carbons, the carbamate is O=C(OCH2CH3)NH-. So the carbamate part is N-C-O-C-O-CH2CH3. Wait, the formula would be C6H5NHCOOCH2CH3. So carbamate is NHCOOCH2CH3. The carbons: 6 (Ph) + 1 (N) + 1 (C from COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 6+1+1+2=10? No. Wait, the carbamate is O=C(NH-O-CH2CH3)-O-. Wait, maybe better to count each atom:

C6H5 (6C) + N (1N) + C (from carbonyl) + O2 + CH2CH3 (2C). So total C: 6 +1 +2=9. Yes! So C6H5-NH-CO-O-CH2CH3. That's 6 (Ph) + 1 (N) + 1 (CO) + 2 (OCH2CH3) = 10? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's count:

Phenyl group: 6C

NH: 1N

COO: 2O and 1C

Ethyl group (OCH2CH3): 2C and 1O

So total C: 6 +1 (from COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 9C. Yes.

Hydrogens: phenyl (5H, since one H is replaced) + NH (1H) + OCH2CH3 (5H) + COO (no H). Wait, phenyl has 5H (if substituted once), NH (assuming it's NH, but carbamate is OCONHR, so R is phenyl. The structure would be O=C(OCH2CH3)NHPh. So the NH is part of the carbamate. Let's count H:

Ph group: 5H

NH: 1H

OCH2CH3: 5H (CH2CH3 has 5H? No, ethyl group is CH2CH3, which has 5H: two on CH2 and three on CH3. Wait, OCH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H. Then carbonyl group: O=C(OCH2CH3)NHPh. The NH would have one H. So total H: 5 (Ph) +1 (NH) +5 (OCH2CH3) = 11 H. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check: C: 6 (Ph) + 2 (OCH2CH3) +1 (CO) = 9. N:1. O: 3 (from COO and OCH2CH3). Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which has two O's. But the carbamate would have three O's: one from carbonyl, two from the ester (OCH2CH3 and the oxygen connecting to the NH). Hmm, that's a problem. So this structure would have three O's, but the formula has two. So that can't be. So maybe that's not the right structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an amide. Let's say ethyl phenylacetamide. Structure: Ph-CH2-CONH-OEt? Not sure. Wait, maybe the amide is attached to the benzene ring. For example, ethyl 4-acetamidobenzoate. But that would have more oxygen atoms. Let me think differently.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's subtract the ethyl ester (OCH2CH3), which is 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen. So remaining is C7H6NO. Then, we have a benzene ring (C6H5), so remaining is C1H1NO. Hmm. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the ethyl ester is not part of an aromatic system. Wait, but the NMR shows aromatic protons, so the benzene ring is present.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a benzamide with an ethyl group. For example, N-ethylbenzamide. Structure: Ph-CONH-CH2CH3. The formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check: Benzamide is C7H7NO (Ph-CONH2). Replacing NH2 with NHCH2CH3 adds one C and two H, so C8H9NO. Wait, no. Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2? Wait, benzamide is PhCONH2, which is C7H7NO2. Then N-ethylbenzamide would be PhCONHCH2CH3, which is C9H11NO2. Yes! That matches the molecular formula. Let's check the spectral data.

IR: The carbonyl (amide) would be around 1650-1680 cm-1, but the IR here shows 1720 cm-1. Hmm, discrepancy. Amides have lower carbonyl stretches than esters. So maybe that's a problem. Also, the NH in the amide would be a stretch around 3300 cm-1, which matches the given IR peaks (3420 and 3325). But the carbonyl is too high for an amide. Maybe it's an ester and an amide?

Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If it's N-ethylbenzamide, then the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check the NMR:

1.20 ppm triplet (3H) would be the CH3 of the ethyl group attached to the nitrogen. The NH would be a broad peak. The ethyl group attached to N would have the CH2 next to N. In N-ethyl groups, the CH2 is usually around 3.3 ppm as a quartet, but maybe if it's adjacent to an amide, it could be deshielded. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is more like an OCH2. So that might not fit. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be the NH2, but in N-ethylbenzamide, the NH is a single proton (NHCH2CH3), which would be a singlet, but maybe broad. However, the integration is 2H here. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not N-ethylbenzamide.

Back to the drawing board. Let's consider the ethyl ester group (from the NMR: 1.20 triplet, 4.5 quartet). Then, the carbonyl is an ester at 1720 cm-1. The remaining parts are a benzene ring with substituents that include an NH2 group. The benzene ring has two doublets, suggesting para substitution. So maybe the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Even though earlier calculation suggested the formula might not match, let's check again.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing one H with NH2 gives C7H7NO2. Then, making the ethyl ester adds OCH2CH3 (which is C2H5O). So total formula would be C7H7NO2 + C2H5O = C9H12NO3. But our compound is C9H11NO2. So we have an extra O and H. Hmm. Wait, maybe the NH2 is replacing an O? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is not benzoic acid but another acid. Let me think.

Wait, what if the benzene ring is not part of the ester but is attached to an amide? For example, ethyl 4-aminophenylacetate. Structure: CH2COOEt attached to a benzene ring with an NH2 group. But then the formula would be C6H5NH2CH2COOEt. Let's count: benzene (6C), NH2 (1N), CH2COOEt (4C, since COOEt is 3C: COO is 2C and Et is 2C, but CH2 is another C). Wait, maybe:

Ph-NH2-CH2-COOEt. That would be 6 (Ph) + 1 (CH2) + 3 (COOEt) = 10C. Not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is ethyl 4-amino-3-nitrobenzoate. But that would add more oxygens and nitrogens. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe the NH2 is not on the benzene ring. Let's see. If the benzene ring is part of the ester (like in ethyl benzoate), and there's an additional NH2 group somewhere else. For example, ethyl benzoate with an NH2 group on the ethyl chain. But ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Adding an NH2 would make it C9H11NO2. That fits the formula. So maybe ethyl 2-amino benzoate? Wait, no. Wait, if the NH2 is on the ethyl group. For example, ethyl glycinate benzoate? Not sure. Wait, the ethyl group is OCH2CH3. If one of the CH2 hydrogens is replaced by NH2, making OCH2NH2CH3. But that would be a different structure. Alternatively, the NH2 is part of a separate group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is phenylethylamine with an ester. Wait, phenylethylamine is C8H11N. Adding an ester group (COO) would require more oxygens. Maybe not.

Wait, let's try to piece it together:

- Ethyl ester group: COOCH2CH3 (from NMR and IR)
- Benzene ring with para substituents (from NMR: 7.0 and 8.0 ppm doublets)
- NH2 group (from IR and NMR 4.0 ppm)

So putting this together, the structure could be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Even though the formula seems off, maybe my initial calculation was wrong. Let me recount:

4-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2 (benzoic acid C7H6O2 minus one H plus NH2). Then, as ethyl ester, it would be C7H7NO2 + C2H5O- (from esterification). Wait, esterification replaces the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH2CH3. So the molecular formula of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C7H7NO2 (acid) minus H2O (from esterification) plus C2H5O. Wait, esterification is: RCOOH + HOCH2CH3 → RCOOCH2CH3 + H2O. So the formula of the ester is (RCOOCH2CH3) where R is the rest of the acid. So the acid is 4-aminobenzoic acid: C7H7NO2. The ester would then be C7H7NO2 - H2O + C2H5OH. Wait, no. The molecular formula of the ester is (C7H6NO2)(COOCH2CH3). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's do it step by step.

4-aminobenzoic acid: C7H7NO2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, replacing one H with NH2).

Esterification with ethanol (C2H5OH) would replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with -OCH2CH3. So the ester would be C7H7NO2 - (OH) + (OCH2CH3).

OH is H1O1, OCH2CH3 is C2H5O1.

So subtracting H1O1 and adding C2H5O1:

C: 7 + 2 = 9

H: 7 (from acid) -1 (from OH) +5 (from OCH2CH3) = 11

N:1

O:2 (from acid) -1 (from OH) +1 (from OCH2CH3) = 2

So the formula is C9H11NO2. Yes! That matches. So ethyl 4-aminobenzoate has the correct molecular formula. Earlier miscalculation was my mistake. So this compound fits.

Now check the spectral data:

IR: The NH2 group would have N-H stretches at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which matches the given IR. The ester carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 is correct.

NMR:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl CH3, adjacent to OCH2, so triplet.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 of the ethyl group, quartet.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2 group, broad singlet due to exchange broadening.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets correspond to the protons ortho and meta to the substituents. In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is para to the ester group. The amino group is electron-donating, which usually shields the ortho protons, but in this case, the ester is electron-withdrawing. Wait, the ester group is in the para position to the amino group. The amino group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to the amino group would be deshielded (downfield), and the protons meta to the amino group (which are ortho to the ester) would also be deshielded. Hmm, maybe the coupling is between the two sets of protons. Alternatively, in para-substituted benzene rings with two different substituents, the coupling can lead to specific patterns. However, in this case, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt in para positions. The NH2 is electron-donating, causing the adjacent protons (ortho to NH2) to be deshielded and appear downfield. The COOEt is electron-withdrawing, causing its adjacent protons (ortho to COOEt) to be deshielded and also downfield. But since they are para to each other, the protons adjacent to NH2 are ortho to NH2 and meta to COOEt, and vice versa. This might result in two distinct doublets. The actual chemical shifts depend on the substituents. The amino group's protons might be at lower ppm (around 7.0) and the ester's protons at higher ppm (around 8.0). Alternatively, the reverse. Let me check typical shifts.

In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is para to the ester. The amino group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it are deshielded and appear downfield. The ester group is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it are also deshielded. But since they are para, the two sets of protons are across from each other. So each pair of protons is adjacent to one substituent and across from the other. The actual shifts can vary, but typically, the protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing group (ester) would be more downfield. So the protons next to the ester (ortho to COOEt) would be around 8.0 ppm, and those next to the NH2 (ortho to NH2) around 7.0 ppm. This matches the NMR data given: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). The coupling between the two sets of protons would result in each being a doublet.

The NH2 protons are at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. Wait, but NH2 protons are usually around 5-6 ppm, but in aromatic amines, they can be downfield shifted. However, in this case, the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine (aniline derivative), which typically has NH2 protons around 5 ppm as a broad peak. But the given data shows the NH2 at 4.0 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's because of the para electron-withdrawing group (ester) which deshields the NH2 protons, causing them to appear upfield? Or perhaps there's some hydrogen bonding or exchange with the solvent. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide, but in this structure, it's a free amine. Alternatively, maybe the sample is in DMSO-d6, which can cause shifts, but the question doesn't specify the solvent. 

Alternatively, maybe the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but another proton. But with integration 2H, and the IR showing N-H stretches, it's likely NH2. The shift might be due to the para substituent. Or perhaps it's an alcohol, but the IR doesn't show a broad O-H stretch. 

Overall, despite the slight discrepancy in the NH2 shift, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate seems to fit the data best. Let me confirm the coupling in the aromatic region. For a para-disubstituted benzene with two different groups, the protons can be split into two doublets if the substituents have different electronic effects. The coupling constant between the two sets of protons (ortho to each substituent) would be around 8-9 Hz. The integration of 2H each suggests that each doublet corresponds to two equivalent protons. This matches the expected pattern for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Thus, putting it all together, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The coupling pattern (doublets) suggests substituents in the para positions. The upfield shift of the aromatic protons (7.0 and 8.0 ppm) suggests the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, such as a nitro group (-NO2) or an ester group. However, the molecular formula includes one nitrogen but two oxygen atoms. If there's an ester (which uses two oxygens), the nitrogen must be part of another group. Since the IR shows N-H stretches, the nitrogen is likely in an amine group.\n\nPutting this together, the compound could be a para-substituted benzene ring with an ester group and an amine. However, the molecule must have C9H11NO2. Let's break down the substituents:\n\n- Benzene ring (C6H5)\n- Ethyl ester group (COOCH2CH3, which is C3H5O2)\n- An amine group (NH2, which is N and H2)\n\nCombining these gives C6H5 + C3H5O2 + NH2 = C9H10NO2. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, so there's an extra hydrogen. This suggests that the amine is part of a substituent that adds one more hydrogen. For example, if the amine is part of an ethyl group attached to the benzene, like -CH2CH2NH2. However, that would add more hydrogens. Alternatively, if the amine is directly attached to the benzene as an -NH2 group, but then we need another substituent.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and an amino group (-NH2). But then the formula would be:\n\nBenzene (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NH2 (NH2). Total: C9H7NO2 + H5 (from benzene) + H5 (from ester) + H2 (from NH2) = C9H14NO2. That's not matching. So maybe the substituents are arranged differently.\n\nAlternatively, the benzene ring could have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) and an acetamide group (-NHCOCH3). But acetamide would add C2H5NO. Let's check:\n\nBenzene (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NHCOCH3 (C2H4NO). Total: C6 + C3 + C2 = C11. That's too much. Not matching C9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compound is phenethylamine derivative. Wait, but the ester group must be present. Let me think again.\n\nThe molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's subtract the ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3: C3H5O2). That leaves C6H6N. The remaining part must be a benzene ring with an amino group. C6H5NH2 is aniline (C6H7N). But here we have C6H6N. So perhaps the benzene ring has a substituent that's NH2 and another substituent. Wait, but C6H5NH2 is C6H7N, so if we subtract that from C6H6N, we have a deficit. Hmm, maybe another substituent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has an ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3) and a methyl amine (CH2NH2). Let's see:\n\nCOOCH2CH3 is C3H5O2. Benzene (C6H5) plus CH2NH2 (C2H6N). Total: C6 + C3 + C2 = C11. Again, too much. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester (COOCH2CH3) and the other is an amino group (NH2). Let's count:\n\nBenzene (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NH2 (NH2) gives C9H9NO2. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So we need two more hydrogens. Maybe the amino group is part of a CH2 group. For example, if the substituents are COOCH2CH3 and CH2NH2. Then:\n\nBenzene (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + CH2NH2 (C2H6N) gives C6+3+2 = C11. Again, over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the amino group is part of an ethyl group. Let me think. Maybe the structure is phenylalanine ethyl ester? Phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. Let's check: phenylalanine has the formula C9H11NO2. Its ethyl ester would be C11H15NO2, which is larger. Not matching. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. Phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. But phenylalanine's structure is an amino acid: NH2-CH(CH2C6H5)-COOH. If it's the ethyl ester, then the COOH becomes COOEt, making it C11H15NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2, so that's not matching. Therefore, phenylalanine itself is C9H11NO2. Let me check:\n\nPhenylalanine: C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-COOH. Molecular formula: C9H11NO2. However, the NMR data provided doesn't match phenylalanine. Let's see.\n\nIn phenylalanine's NMR, we would expect the aromatic protons (C6H5), a CH2 group adjacent to the benzene, a CH(NH2), and the COOH. However, the NMR data here shows an ethyl ester (quartet and triplet), which phenylalanine doesn't have unless it's the ethyl ester. But phenylalanine ethyl ester would have the formula C11H15NO2, which doesn't match. Therefore, the compound is not phenylalanine ethyl ester.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Let's see. 4-Aminobenzoic acid is NH2-C6H4-COOH. The ethyl ester would be NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Yes: C6 (benzene) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NH2 (N and H2). Total: C9H11NO2. That matches.\n\nNow check the NMR data for this structure (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate):\n\nAromatic protons: The benzene ring has two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which is typical for para-substituted benzene. The substituents are NH2 and COOEt in para positions. The NH2 group would be electron-donating, so the adjacent protons would be upfield. Wait, but in the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 ppm (d) and 8.0 ppm (d). Let me check the expected shifts.\n\nIn 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is strongly electron-donating (para to the ester), so the protons ortho to the NH2 would be upfield (around 6.5-7.0 ppm), and those ortho to the ester (electron-withdrawing) would be downfield (around 7.8-8.0 ppm). So the two doublets would be at 6.5-7.0 and 7.8-8.0 ppm. The given data shows 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which matches.\n\nThe NH2 protons in the IR have medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are N-H stretches. However, in the 1H NMR, the NH2 protons are not shown. Wait, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 protons. But in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine (aniline), which typically shows broad peaks, but in the case of aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons can exchange rapidly and may appear as a broad singlet. However, the chemical shift for NH2 in aniline is usually around 3-5 ppm, but sometimes lower. Let me confirm. In aniline, the NH2 protons are around 3.3 ppm as a broad peak. However, in 4-aminobenzoic acid, the NH2 protons might be downfield shifted due to conjugation with the carbonyl. Alternatively, the NH2 could be deprotonated, but the compound is neutral. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could correspond to the NH2 group. However, sometimes when the NH2 is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl), the protons become more deshielded and may appear downfield. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide, but the IR shows N-H stretches, which in amides are around 3300 cm-1, but here they are at 3420 and 3325, which are more like amines. Amides usually have two bands (symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretches), but amines can also have these. The presence of a strong band at 1720 cm-1 (ester) and amine N-H stretches suggests ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nThe ethyl ester group would give the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The quartet at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) matches the OCH2CH3 group. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) is the CH3. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) would then be the NH2 group. However, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 protons are typically more downfield (around 5-6 ppm) if they are free, but sometimes they can be broad and appear around 4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is protected or in a different environment.\n\nAlternatively, if the NH2 is acetylated (as in acetanilide), but that would change the molecular formula. Let me check: acetanilide is C8H9NO, so not matching. So the original assumption of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate seems plausible.\n\nTherefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386762, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=2734, prompt_tokens=539, total_tokens=3273, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

The carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 would then be the ester carbonyl (COO).

The aromatic signals at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring with electron-withdrawing groups. The coupling pattern (doublets) suggests substituents in the para positions. The upfield shift of the aromatic protons (7.0 and 8.0 ppm) suggests the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, such as a nitro group (-NO2) or an ester group. However, the molecular formula includes one nitrogen but two oxygen atoms. If there's an ester (which uses two oxygens), the nitrogen must be part of another group. Since the IR shows N-H stretches, the nitrogen is likely in an amine group.

Putting this together, the compound could be a para-substituted benzene ring with an ester group and an amine. However, the molecule must have C9H11NO2. Let's break down the substituents:

- Benzene ring (C6H5)
- Ethyl ester group (COOCH2CH3, which is C3H5O2)
- An amine group (NH2, which is N and H2)

Combining these gives C6H5 + C3H5O2 + NH2 = C9H10NO2. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, so there's an extra hydrogen. This suggests that the amine is part of a substituent that adds one more hydrogen. For example, if the amine is part of an ethyl group attached to the benzene, like -CH2CH2NH2. However, that would add more hydrogens. Alternatively, if the amine is directly attached to the benzene as an -NH2 group, but then we need another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group (O-CO-OCH2CH3) and an amino group (-NH2). But then the formula would be:

Benzene (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NH2 (NH2). Total: C9H7NO2 + H5 (from benzene) + H5 (from ester) + H2 (from NH2) = C9H14NO2. That's not matching. So maybe the substituents are arranged differently.

Alternatively, the benzene ring could have an ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3) and an acetamide group (-NHCOCH3). But acetamide would add C2H5NO. Let's check:

Benzene (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NHCOCH3 (C2H4NO). Total: C6 + C3 + C2 = C11. That's too much. Not matching C9.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is phenethylamine derivative. Wait, but the ester group must be present. Let me think again.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's subtract the ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3: C3H5O2). That leaves C6H6N. The remaining part must be a benzene ring with an amino group. C6H5NH2 is aniline (C6H7N). But here we have C6H6N. So perhaps the benzene ring has a substituent that's NH2 and another substituent. Wait, but C6H5NH2 is C6H7N, so if we subtract that from C6H6N, we have a deficit. Hmm, maybe another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring has an ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3) and a methyl amine (CH2NH2). Let's see:

COOCH2CH3 is C3H5O2. Benzene (C6H5) plus CH2NH2 (C2H6N). Total: C6 + C3 + C2 = C11. Again, too much. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester (COOCH2CH3) and the other is an amino group (NH2). Let's count:

Benzene (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NH2 (NH2) gives C9H9NO2. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So we need two more hydrogens. Maybe the amino group is part of a CH2 group. For example, if the substituents are COOCH2CH3 and CH2NH2. Then:

Benzene (C6H5) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + CH2NH2 (C2H6N) gives C6+3+2 = C11. Again, over.

Alternatively, maybe the amino group is part of an ethyl group. Let me think. Maybe the structure is phenylalanine ethyl ester? Phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. Let's check: phenylalanine has the formula C9H11NO2. Its ethyl ester would be C11H15NO2, which is larger. Not matching. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. Phenylalanine is C9H11NO2. But phenylalanine's structure is an amino acid: NH2-CH(CH2C6H5)-COOH. If it's the ethyl ester, then the COOH becomes COOEt, making it C11H15NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2, so that's not matching. Therefore, phenylalanine itself is C9H11NO2. Let me check:

Phenylalanine: C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-COOH. Molecular formula: C9H11NO2. However, the NMR data provided doesn't match phenylalanine. Let's see.

In phenylalanine's NMR, we would expect the aromatic protons (C6H5), a CH2 group adjacent to the benzene, a CH(NH2), and the COOH. However, the NMR data here shows an ethyl ester (quartet and triplet), which phenylalanine doesn't have unless it's the ethyl ester. But phenylalanine ethyl ester would have the formula C11H15NO2, which doesn't match. Therefore, the compound is not phenylalanine ethyl ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Let's see. 4-Aminobenzoic acid is NH2-C6H4-COOH. The ethyl ester would be NH2-C6H4-COOCH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. Yes: C6 (benzene) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2) + NH2 (N and H2). Total: C9H11NO2. That matches.

Now check the NMR data for this structure (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate):

Aromatic protons: The benzene ring has two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which is typical for para-substituted benzene. The substituents are NH2 and COOEt in para positions. The NH2 group would be electron-donating, so the adjacent protons would be upfield. Wait, but in the NMR data, the aromatic protons are at 7.0 ppm (d) and 8.0 ppm (d). Let me check the expected shifts.

In 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is strongly electron-donating (para to the ester), so the protons ortho to the NH2 would be upfield (around 6.5-7.0 ppm), and those ortho to the ester (electron-withdrawing) would be downfield (around 7.8-8.0 ppm). So the two doublets would be at 6.5-7.0 and 7.8-8.0 ppm. The given data shows 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which matches.

The NH2 protons in the IR have medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are N-H stretches. However, in the 1H NMR, the NH2 protons are not shown. Wait, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 protons. But in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine (aniline), which typically shows broad peaks, but in the case of aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons can exchange rapidly and may appear as a broad singlet. However, the chemical shift for NH2 in aniline is usually around 3-5 ppm, but sometimes lower. Let me confirm. In aniline, the NH2 protons are around 3.3 ppm as a broad peak. However, in 4-aminobenzoic acid, the NH2 protons might be downfield shifted due to conjugation with the carbonyl. Alternatively, the NH2 could be deprotonated, but the compound is neutral. The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could correspond to the NH2 group. However, sometimes when the NH2 is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl), the protons become more deshielded and may appear downfield. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide, but the IR shows N-H stretches, which in amides are around 3300 cm-1, but here they are at 3420 and 3325, which are more like amines. Amides usually have two bands (symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretches), but amines can also have these. The presence of a strong band at 1720 cm-1 (ester) and amine N-H stretches suggests ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The ethyl ester group would give the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The quartet at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) matches the OCH2CH3 group. The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) is the CH3. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) would then be the NH2 group. However, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 protons are typically more downfield (around 5-6 ppm) if they are free, but sometimes they can be broad and appear around 4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is protected or in a different environment.

Alternatively, if the NH2 is acetylated (as in acetanilide), but that would change the molecular formula. Let me check: acetanilide is C8H9NO, so not matching. So the original assumption of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate seems plausible.

Therefore, the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

If that's an NH2 group, perhaps part of an amide or an amine. However, the IR showed N-H stretches. If the 4.0 ppm is NH2, then why is it a broad singlet? Amide protons are usually downfield (around 6-8 ppm) and broad. But maybe this is an amine group. Wait, if the compound has both an ester and an amine, perhaps it's an amino ester. Let me think. For example, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate? Let's check the aromatic signals.\n\nThe NMR shows 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two protons in one environment and two in another. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but in this case, maybe a single substituent that causes the ring to have two doublets. Let's see: if there's a substituent in the para position, like a nitro group or an ester group, the protons ortho and meta to the substituent would split into different peaks. Wait, but in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but here there's only two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests that it's a para-disubstituted benzene ring, where each set of protons is equivalent. For example, if there's a substituent in the para position, the two ortho protons would be equivalent, and the two meta protons would also be equivalent. But in that case, the coupling between the ortho and meta protons would lead to more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that the two protons adjacent to it are equivalent, and the two opposite are equivalent. Wait, perhaps it's a substituent with a strong electron-withdrawing group, causing the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. For example, a nitro group in the para position would deshield the ortho and para protons. Wait, but in nitrobenzene, the protons are split into a triplet and a doublet, but maybe with another substituent. Alternatively, if there's an ester group attached to the benzene ring, like in methyl benzoate, the ortho and para protons are deshielded. But in para-substituted benzoate esters, the aromatic protons typically split into two doublets. For example, ethyl para-nitrobenzoate would have two doublets. However, in this case, the substituent might be an ester group (from the ethyl) and an amino group. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count atoms. If it's ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check:\n\nBenzoic acid is C7H6O2. If we have an ethyl ester (C2H5O), replacing the -OH of benzoic acid with -OCH2CH3, that gives C9H10O2. Then, if there's an amino group (-NH2) substituent on the benzene ring, that would add one N and two H's. Wait, the formula of ethyl para-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2. Exactly. So that matches the molecular formula.\n\nNow, let's check the NMR for this structure. The ethyl ester would give a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The aromatic protons would be two doublets: the para-aminobenzoate would have two protons ortho to the ester and two protons ortho to the amino group. Wait, but in para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, the substituents are in the para positions: one is the ester (OCOOEt) and the other is NH2. Then, the aromatic protons adjacent to the NH2 would be deshielded, and those adjacent to the ester would be more deshielded. Let's check typical shifts. In para-substituted benzoates, the protons ortho to the ester group are usually around 8.0 ppm (as in ethyl benzoate, the ortho protons are around 8.0 ppm), and the meta protons are around 7.0 ppm. However, if there's an amino group in the para position, the amino group is a strong electron-donating group, so the protons adjacent to it would be upfield. So maybe in para-aminobenzoate ester, the two protons adjacent to the NH2 would be around 7.0 ppm (as the amino group donates electrons, shielding the protons), and the protons adjacent to the ester (electron-withdrawing) would be downfield around 8.0 ppm. The coupling between these protons would result in two doublets. So the 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would correspond to the aromatic protons adjacent to the amino and ester groups, respectively. That fits.\n\nNow, the NH2 group. In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. If this is the NH2 group, then why is it at 4.0 ppm? Typically, aromatic amines (aniline derivatives) have NH2 protons around 5-6 ppm, but they are broad due to exchange. However, in para-aminobenzoate ester, the NH2 is part of the aromatic ring. But maybe the NH2 is in a different environment. Wait, but perhaps the NH2 is not on the aromatic ring. Wait, no—if the compound is ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene ring. Then, the NH2 protons would be even more downfield. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a different group, but given the molecular formula and the rest of the data, it's more likely on the benzene ring. However, the NMR shows the NH2 at 4.0 ppm, which is lower than expected. This discrepancy needs to be addressed.\n\nWait, perhaps the NH2 is acetylated. If the compound is an acetanilide derivative, then the NH would be an amide. For example, ethyl para-acetamidobenzoate. Let's check the formula: the molecular formula would then be C10H13NO3, which is higher than the given formula (C9H11NO2). So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is free. Let me check again. If the NH2 is on the benzene ring, why is the NMR signal at 4.0 ppm? Maybe it's not NH2. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an -OCH2- group. But it's a broad singlet. If it's an OCH2 group, like in a methylene dioxy group, but that would require two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen and a nitrogen. Wait, but the IR shows N-H stretches. Let's think again.\n\nThe IR data: the strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ are likely N-H stretching. Primary amines have two N-H stretches (asymmetric and symmetric), which could be around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹. If the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine, the absorption would be in that region. However, in the NMR, the NH2 protons would typically be downfield (around 5 ppm or higher) and broad. But here, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. Maybe the NH2 is in a different environment, such as an aliphatic amine, but then the shifts would be lower. Wait, aliphatic amines can have NH2 protons around 1.5-3 ppm, but they are usually broad. However, 4.0 ppm seems a bit high for an aliphatic NH2. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. But amide protons are usually around 6-8 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a urea group, but that's not indicated here. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's consider another structure. Suppose the compound is phenylethylamine derivative. But the molecular formula includes two oxygen atoms. Maybe it's a phenylalanine ethyl ester? Phenylalanine is an amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2. Wait, phenylalanine's formula is C9H11NO2. Yes! The molecular formula matches. Let me check. Phenylalanine is an amino acid with a benzene ring, a CH2CH(NH2)COOH group. But if it's an ethyl ester, then the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me verify. Phenylalanine itself is C9H11NO2. If it's the ethyl ester, then the formula would be C9H11NO2 + C2H5O (from esterification) minus H2O, which would actually be C9H11NO2 + C2H5O - H2O = C10H13NO3. No, that doesn't match. So phenylalanine's ethyl ester would have a higher molecular formula. Therefore, maybe the compound is phenylalanine itself. But phenylalanine's structure is a benzene ring connected to a CH2CH(NH2)COOH. Let's check the molecular formula. The benzene ring (C6H5), then CH2CH(NH2)COOH: that adds up to 6 (C6) + 3 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (COOH) = 6+3+1+1=11 C? Wait, wait, let me count again. Benzene (C6H5), then CH2CH(NH2)COOH. The chain is CH2-CH(NH2)-COOH. That's 2 carbons in CH2-CH, then the COOH is another two carbons (the carbonyl and the hydroxyl), but wait, COOH is -COOH, which is one carbon. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH2-CH) + 1 (COOH) = 9 carbons. Then, nitrogen from NH2 and oxygen from COOH and the other oxygen. So molecular formula C9H11NO2. That matches. So phenylalanine has the formula C9H11NO2. But does the NMR data fit?\n\nPhenylalanine's structure: benzene ring connected to CH2CH(NH2)COOH. Let's look at the NMR. The aromatic protons would be a monosubstituted benzene (since the substituent is on the benzene ring). Monosubstituted benzene typically shows a singlet if the substituent is such that the protons are equivalent. However, in phenylalanine, the substituent is a CH2CH(NH2)COOH group, which is a meta director. The aromatic protons would split into a complex multiplet. But in the given NMR data, there are two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So this might not match. Alternatively, if the substituent is para, but phenylalanine's substituent is on the alpha carbon. Wait, phenylalanine has a benzyl group attached to the alpha carbon of the amino acid. So the benzene ring is connected via a CH2 group. Therefore, the substituent on the benzene ring is a CH2 group. A benzyl substituent is a meta director, leading to a monosubstituted benzene with complex splitting. But the NMR shows two doublets, which is more indicative of a para-disubstituted benzene. Therefore, phenylalanine might not fit the NMR data.\n\nLet's go back to the initial thought of ethyl para-aminobenzoate. The formula is C9H11NO2. Let's confirm:\n\nEthyl para-aminobenzoate structure: O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2. The molecular formula would be C7 (benzene ring) + O2 (from ester) + C2H5 (ethyl) + NH2. So, 7 + 2 (from COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 9 carbons. Nitrogen is 1, oxygen is 2 (from ester) + 1 (from NH2? Wait, no. The NH2 is part of the benzene ring, so the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count:\n\nBenzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing the -OH with OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) gives C7H5O2 + C2H5O → C9H10O3. Wait, but the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. So that's a discrepancy. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate. Para-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2. Ethyl para-aminobenzoate would be C7H7NO2 + C2H5O - H2O (from esterification). So the formula would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one too many oxygens. Therefore, ethyl para-aminobenzoate is not possible. So that approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an amide. Let's consider an amide structure. The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is higher than typical amides (which are around 1650-1700 cm⁻¹). But maybe it's an acetylated amine. For example, N-acetyl something. Let's think. If the compound is acetanilide (N-phenylacetamide), the formula is C8H9NO. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a different amide.\n\nAlternatively, the compound could be an ethyl carbamate, but that's less likely. Wait, the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let's think of possible functional groups. The IR shows N-H and carbonyl. The NMR suggests an ethyl group, a possible NH2 or OCH2, and a para-substituted benzene. Let me try another approach. Let's tally the hydrogen environments from the NMR:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): CH3 adjacent to a CH2.\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Possibly NH2 (broad), but at 4.0 ppm. Alternatively, OCH2 or another group.\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom (like O), quartet suggests coupling to a CH3.\n- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene.\n\nPutting this together: ethyl group (CH2CH3), a para-substituted benzene, and a group with 2H that's either NH2 or OCH2. The carbonyl (from IR) could be part of an ester (O-CO-O) or an amide (NH-CO-O). Wait, but the molecular formula has two oxygens. Let's count: ester groups have two oxygens (O-CO-O), but if there's an amide, that's another oxygen. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So two oxygens and one nitrogen. If there's an ester group (COO), that accounts for two oxygens. Then, the nitrogen must be in an amine or amide group. If it's an amide, that would require an additional oxygen, but the formula only has two oxygens. Therefore, the nitrogen is likely in an amine group. So, perhaps the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that would require three oxygens. Let me check again.\n\nPara-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is H2N-C6H4-COOH. Its molecular formula is C7H7NO2. If we esterify the -COOH with ethanol, replacing the -OH with -OCH2CH3, the formula becomes C7H7NO2 + C2H5O - H2O. The original formula of PABA is C7H7NO2. Adding ethyl group (C2H5O) and subtracting H2O (which is -H from the -COOH and -OH from ethanol), the formula becomes C7 + C2 = C9, H7 + H5 - H2 = H10, N=1, O=2 +1 -1=2. So C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So one hydrogen short. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hydrogen count. Let's do it step by step.\n\nPABA: C7H7NO2. When esterified with ethanol (C2H5OH), the reaction is:\n\nC7H7NO2 (PABA) + C2H5OH → C9H11NO2 (ethyl ester) + H2O.\n\nSo the molecular formula of the ester would be C7 + C2 = C9, H7 + H6 (from ethanol) - 2 (from H2O) = H11, N=1, O=2 +1 (from ethanol) -1 (from H2O) = O2. So yes, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2. That matches the given formula. So this is a possibility.\n\nNow, checking the NMR for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:\n\n- The ethyl group: OCH2CH3. The CH3 would be a triplet at ~1.2-1.4 ppm, and the OCH2 would be a quartet at ~4.1-4.3 ppm. The given NMR has 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). The quartet at 4.5 ppm is a bit upfield for an OCH2 group (usually around 4.1-4.3), but solvent or substituent effects might shift it. Alternatively, maybe there's another group adjacent.\n\nThe aromatic protons: In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is para to the ester. The amino group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it would be deshielded (upfield?), while the protons meta to the ester (which is electron-withdrawing) would be downfield. Wait, actually, the ester group is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it would be deshielded (downfield), and the amino group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it would be shielded (upfield). Therefore, the two protons ortho to the NH2 would be upfield (around 7.0 ppm), and the two protons ortho to the ester (COOEt) would be downfield (around 8.0 ppm). This matches the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). The coupling between these protons would be para to each other, so each pair would be a doublet (J = 8-9 Hz).\n\nNow, the NH2 group. In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. The protons of NH2 in aromatic amines are typically broad and appear around 5-6 ppm. However, the NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). This seems lower than expected. Possible reasons could be exchange with deuterated solvent (if D2O was added, but the peak is still present) or perhaps the NH2 is part of a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not on the benzene ring but in another part of the molecule. Wait, but the molecular formula and the rest of the data suggest the structure. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is in an aliphatic position, but that would complicate the structure. Let me check the IR again. The IR shows N-H stretches at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Primary amines (aliphatic or aromatic) have two N-H stretches. In aromatic amines, the N-H stretches are slightly lower in wavenumber. The given IR bands are around 3400 cm⁻¹, which is consistent with an aromatic amine. However, the NMR shows the NH2 at 4.0 ppm, which is lower than expected. Could this be due to some exchange or solvent effect? Or maybe the NH2 is not free. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide, but the carbonyl is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is higher than typical amides. Wait, the IR shows a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more indicative of an ester or ketone. If it's an ester, then the carbonyl is part of the ester group. Then, the NH2 would be on the benzene ring. The conflicting point is the NMR shift of NH2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NH2 is not on the benzene ring but in another part. Let's consider if there's an ethyl group attached to a nitrogen. For example, ethyl carbamate or something else. Let's think of another structure. Suppose the compound is phenacetin, which is an ethyl ester of para-ethoxyacetanilide. But phenacetin's formula is C10H13NO3. Not matching. Alternatively, lidocaine? No, formula doesn't match. Alternatively, a simple ethyl ester with an amine substituent.\n\nWait, another possibility: the compound is ethyl 4-aminophenylacetate. But that would have the structure CH2COOEt attached to a benzene ring with an NH2 group. But that would change the substitution pattern. The molecular formula would be C10H13NO2, which doesn't match. Alternatively, if the ester is directly attached to the benzene ring, as in ethyl benzoate with an amino group. But we already considered that and had a discrepancy in oxygen count. Wait, no—if it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the formula is C9H11NO2, which matches. Then why is the NH2 appearing at 4.0 ppm? Maybe the sample was run in DMSO-d6, and the NH2 is exchanging with residual H2O, causing it to appear broad but shifted. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is protonated, but that would be in acidic conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is part of a different group. Wait, maybe it's not NH2 but an NH group. But the integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2O- group, but that would require two oxygen atoms. The IR doesn't show strong absorption for an ether, though.\n\nAlternatively, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be an -NH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, making it less deshielded. For example, in a structure like ethyl 2-aminobenzoate (ortho isomer), but that might change the aromatic shifts. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a glycine residue, but that would complicate the structure. Alternatively, maybe the compound has a morpholine ring or similar, but that would require more oxygen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is not NH2 but another group. For example, a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen and a nitrogen, causing some splitting. But the integration is 2H. If it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen and a nitrogen, maybe in a structure like CH2NH2-O-..., but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2NH2 group, but that would be a hydroxylamine derivative, which is less common.\n\nWait, going back to the IR data: the strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is likely an ester (C=O stretch). The N-H stretches at ~3400 cm⁻¹ suggest an amine. So combining these, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate fits the formula and most of the data except the NH2 shift. However, maybe the NH2 protons are split into a broad peak at 4.0 ppm due to exchange broadening. In some cases, especially if the solution is not perfectly dry or if there's some exchange with solvent, the NH2 protons can appear broader and shifted. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a different group. Let's check the possible shifts again.\n\nIn ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 protons are attached to the benzene ring. In DMSO-d6, which is a common NMR solvent, the NH2 protons of aniline derivatives are usually around 5-6 ppm and are broad. However, if the compound is in CDCl3, and the NH2 is not deprotonated, it might appear differently. If the NH2 is in a less polar solvent, maybe the chemical shift is lower. However, 4.0 ppm still seems low. Another possibility: the NH2 group is not on the benzene ring but in another part of the molecule. For example, if there's a side chain with an NH2 group. Let's consider a structure where the benzene ring is connected to an ester group (COOEt) and a CH2NH2 group. For example, ethyl (2-aminoethyl)benzoate. The formula would be C6H5COOCH2CH2NH2. Let's count the atoms: C6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH2) + N = C9H11NO2. That matches. Let's check the NMR for this structure.\n\nThe ester group would have the ethyl's CH3 at 1.20 ppm (t) and OCH2 at 4.5 ppm (q). The CH2NH2 group would have the CH2 next to the NH2. The NH2 protons might appear as a broad singlet around 4.0 ppm (if the CH2 is adjacent to NH2). The aromatic protons would be a monosubstituted benzene, leading to a complex splitting pattern, but maybe in this case, it's a para-substituted ester. Wait, no—if the benzoate is in the para position relative to the CH2NH2, but that would require two substituents on the benzene ring, which would change the aromatic signals. Alternatively, if the benzoate is in the ortho position, but again, the splitting would be different. This structure might not explain the two doublets in the aromatic region. Therefore, this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the compound is ethyl 4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylate. But then the aromatic protons would be absent. The given NMR shows aromatic protons, so the benzene ring is present.\n\nGiven all this, the most plausible structure seems to be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, despite the discrepancy in the NH2 shift. The alternative is that the NH2 is in a different environment, but I can't think of another structure that fits the molecular formula and the rest of the data. Let's check the chemical shifts again for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Looking up reference data:\n\nEthyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as benzocaine) has the following NMR shifts (approximate):\n\n- Ethyl group: CH3 at ~1.3 ppm (triplet), OCH2 at ~4.2 ppm (quartet).\n- Aromatic protons: The two protons ortho to the NH2 are upfield (~6.6 ppm), and the two protons ortho to the ester are downfield (~7.8 ppm). However, in the given data, they are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which is close.\n- NH2 protons: Typically broad around 5-6 ppm but might vary based on solvent and concentration.\n\nIn some cases, especially if the NH2 is deprotonated or in a different solvent, the shift could be lower. Alternatively, if the NH2 is involved in hydrogen bonding or exchange, it might appear broader and at a different shift. However, the given data shows the NH2 at 4.0 ppm, which is lower than typical. This inconsistency is puzzling. \n\nWait, benzocaine's structure is indeed ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let me verify its NMR. According to literature, benzocaine's 1H NMR (CDCl3) shows:\n\n- δ 1.35 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 3H, CH2CH3)\n- δ 4.30 (q, J = 7.1 Hz, 2H, OCH2)\n- δ 6.60 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H, ArH ortho to NH2)\n- δ 7.85 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H, ArH meta to NH2)\n- δ 4.08 (s, 2H, NH2) – but wait, in reality, the NH2 protons in benzocaine are typically observed around δ 3.5-4.5 ppm as a broad peak, but they might not integrate properly if they are exchanging rapidly. However, in CDCl3, the NH2 protons can be broad and sometimes not observed unless the sample is very dry. Alternatively, if the NH2 is protonated, it might appear as a broad singlet. However, in the given data, the NH2 is at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), which matches this range. The aromatic protons in the given data are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which is slightly upfield compared to literature values (6.6 and 7.8), but solvent effects can account for minor shifts. The ethyl group's signals match well: 1.20 ppm (t) and 4.5 ppm (q). The OCH2 in benzocaine is usually around 4.3 ppm, but the given data has it at 4.5 ppm. This could be due to different referencing or solvent.\n\nConsidering all this, the compound is most likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, commonly known as benzocaine. The NH2 protons are observed as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which might be due to the solvent or sample conditions. The IR data supports the presence of an ester (1720 cm⁻¹) and an amine (3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹). The molecular formula matches perfectly. The NMR signals align reasonably when considering possible variations in experimental conditions.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386890, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=6954, prompt_tokens=1188, total_tokens=8142, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

But then, the 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) remains. If that's an NH2 group, perhaps part of an amide or an amine. However, the IR showed N-H stretches. If the 4.0 ppm is NH2, then why is it a broad singlet? Amide protons are usually downfield (around 6-8 ppm) and broad. But maybe this is an amine group. Wait, if the compound has both an ester and an amine, perhaps it's an amino ester. Let me think. For example, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate? Let's check the aromatic signals.

The NMR shows 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two protons in one environment and two in another. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but in this case, maybe a single substituent that causes the ring to have two doublets. Let's see: if there's a substituent in the para position, like a nitro group or an ester group, the protons ortho and meta to the substituent would split into different peaks. Wait, but in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but here there's only two doublets each integrating to 2H, which suggests that it's a para-disubstituted benzene ring, where each set of protons is equivalent. For example, if there's a substituent in the para position, the two ortho protons would be equivalent, and the two meta protons would also be equivalent. But in that case, the coupling between the ortho and meta protons would lead to more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that the two protons adjacent to it are equivalent, and the two opposite are equivalent. Wait, perhaps it's a substituent with a strong electron-withdrawing group, causing the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. For example, a nitro group in the para position would deshield the ortho and para protons. Wait, but in nitrobenzene, the protons are split into a triplet and a doublet, but maybe with another substituent. Alternatively, if there's an ester group attached to the benzene ring, like in methyl benzoate, the ortho and para protons are deshielded. But in para-substituted benzoate esters, the aromatic protons typically split into two doublets. For example, ethyl para-nitrobenzoate would have two doublets. However, in this case, the substituent might be an ester group (from the ethyl) and an amino group. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count atoms. If it's ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's check:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If we have an ethyl ester (C2H5O), replacing the -OH of benzoic acid with -OCH2CH3, that gives C9H10O2. Then, if there's an amino group (-NH2) substituent on the benzene ring, that would add one N and two H's. Wait, the formula of ethyl para-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2. Exactly. So that matches the molecular formula.

Now, let's check the NMR for this structure. The ethyl ester would give a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). The aromatic protons would be two doublets: the para-aminobenzoate would have two protons ortho to the ester and two protons ortho to the amino group. Wait, but in para-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, the substituents are in the para positions: one is the ester (OCOOEt) and the other is NH2. Then, the aromatic protons adjacent to the NH2 would be deshielded, and those adjacent to the ester would be more deshielded. Let's check typical shifts. In para-substituted benzoates, the protons ortho to the ester group are usually around 8.0 ppm (as in ethyl benzoate, the ortho protons are around 8.0 ppm), and the meta protons are around 7.0 ppm. However, if there's an amino group in the para position, the amino group is a strong electron-donating group, so the protons adjacent to it would be upfield. So maybe in para-aminobenzoate ester, the two protons adjacent to the NH2 would be around 7.0 ppm (as the amino group donates electrons, shielding the protons), and the protons adjacent to the ester (electron-withdrawing) would be downfield around 8.0 ppm. The coupling between these protons would result in two doublets. So the 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) would correspond to the aromatic protons adjacent to the amino and ester groups, respectively. That fits.

Now, the NH2 group. In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. If this is the NH2 group, then why is it at 4.0 ppm? Typically, aromatic amines (aniline derivatives) have NH2 protons around 5-6 ppm, but they are broad due to exchange. However, in para-aminobenzoate ester, the NH2 is part of the aromatic ring. But maybe the NH2 is in a different environment. Wait, but perhaps the NH2 is not on the aromatic ring. Wait, no—if the compound is ethyl para-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is directly attached to the benzene ring. Then, the NH2 protons would be even more downfield. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a different group, but given the molecular formula and the rest of the data, it's more likely on the benzene ring. However, the NMR shows the NH2 at 4.0 ppm, which is lower than expected. This discrepancy needs to be addressed.

Wait, perhaps the NH2 is acetylated. If the compound is an acetanilide derivative, then the NH would be an amide. For example, ethyl para-acetamidobenzoate. Let's check the formula: the molecular formula would then be C10H13NO3, which is higher than the given formula (C9H11NO2). So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is free. Let me check again. If the NH2 is on the benzene ring, why is the NMR signal at 4.0 ppm? Maybe it's not NH2. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an -OCH2- group. But it's a broad singlet. If it's an OCH2 group, like in a methylene dioxy group, but that would require two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen and a nitrogen. Wait, but the IR shows N-H stretches. Let's think again.

The IR data: the strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹ are likely N-H stretching. Primary amines have two N-H stretches (asymmetric and symmetric), which could be around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹. If the NH2 is part of an aromatic amine, the absorption would be in that region. However, in the NMR, the NH2 protons would typically be downfield (around 5 ppm or higher) and broad. But here, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. Maybe the NH2 is in a different environment, such as an aliphatic amine, but then the shifts would be lower. Wait, aliphatic amines can have NH2 protons around 1.5-3 ppm, but they are usually broad. However, 4.0 ppm seems a bit high for an aliphatic NH2. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide. But amide protons are usually around 6-8 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a urea group, but that's not indicated here. Hmm.

Wait, let's consider another structure. Suppose the compound is phenylethylamine derivative. But the molecular formula includes two oxygen atoms. Maybe it's a phenylalanine ethyl ester? Phenylalanine is an amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2. Wait, phenylalanine's formula is C9H11NO2. Yes! The molecular formula matches. Let me check. Phenylalanine is an amino acid with a benzene ring, a CH2CH(NH2)COOH group. But if it's an ethyl ester, then the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let me verify. Phenylalanine itself is C9H11NO2. If it's the ethyl ester, then the formula would be C9H11NO2 + C2H5O (from esterification) minus H2O, which would actually be C9H11NO2 + C2H5O - H2O = C10H13NO3. No, that doesn't match. So phenylalanine's ethyl ester would have a higher molecular formula. Therefore, maybe the compound is phenylalanine itself. But phenylalanine's structure is a benzene ring connected to a CH2CH(NH2)COOH. Let's check the molecular formula. The benzene ring (C6H5), then CH2CH(NH2)COOH: that adds up to 6 (C6) + 3 (CH2) + 1 (CH) + 1 (COOH) = 6+3+1+1=11 C? Wait, wait, let me count again. Benzene (C6H5), then CH2CH(NH2)COOH. The chain is CH2-CH(NH2)-COOH. That's 2 carbons in CH2-CH, then the COOH is another two carbons (the carbonyl and the hydroxyl), but wait, COOH is -COOH, which is one carbon. So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH2-CH) + 1 (COOH) = 9 carbons. Then, nitrogen from NH2 and oxygen from COOH and the other oxygen. So molecular formula C9H11NO2. That matches. So phenylalanine has the formula C9H11NO2. But does the NMR data fit?

Phenylalanine's structure: benzene ring connected to CH2CH(NH2)COOH. Let's look at the NMR. The aromatic protons would be a monosubstituted benzene (since the substituent is on the benzene ring). Monosubstituted benzene typically shows a singlet if the substituent is such that the protons are equivalent. However, in phenylalanine, the substituent is a CH2CH(NH2)COOH group, which is a meta director. The aromatic protons would split into a complex multiplet. But in the given NMR data, there are two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So this might not match. Alternatively, if the substituent is para, but phenylalanine's substituent is on the alpha carbon. Wait, phenylalanine has a benzyl group attached to the alpha carbon of the amino acid. So the benzene ring is connected via a CH2 group. Therefore, the substituent on the benzene ring is a CH2 group. A benzyl substituent is a meta director, leading to a monosubstituted benzene with complex splitting. But the NMR shows two doublets, which is more indicative of a para-disubstituted benzene. Therefore, phenylalanine might not fit the NMR data.

Let's go back to the initial thought of ethyl para-aminobenzoate. The formula is C9H11NO2. Let's confirm:

Ethyl para-aminobenzoate structure: O=C(OCH2CH3)-C6H4-NH2. The molecular formula would be C7 (benzene ring) + O2 (from ester) + C2H5 (ethyl) + NH2. So, 7 + 2 (from COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 9 carbons. Nitrogen is 1, oxygen is 2 (from ester) + 1 (from NH2? Wait, no. The NH2 is part of the benzene ring, so the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count:

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Replacing the -OH with OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) gives C7H5O2 + C2H5O → C9H10O3. Wait, but the molecular formula here is C9H11NO2. So that's a discrepancy. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate. Para-aminobenzoic acid is C7H7NO2. Ethyl para-aminobenzoate would be C7H7NO2 + C2H5O - H2O (from esterification). So the formula would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one too many oxygens. Therefore, ethyl para-aminobenzoate is not possible. So that approach is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an amide. Let's consider an amide structure. The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is higher than typical amides (which are around 1650-1700 cm⁻¹). But maybe it's an acetylated amine. For example, N-acetyl something. Let's think. If the compound is acetanilide (N-phenylacetamide), the formula is C8H9NO. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a different amide.

Alternatively, the compound could be an ethyl carbamate, but that's less likely. Wait, the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let's think of possible functional groups. The IR shows N-H and carbonyl. The NMR suggests an ethyl group, a possible NH2 or OCH2, and a para-substituted benzene. Let me try another approach. Let's tally the hydrogen environments from the NMR:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): CH3 adjacent to a CH2.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Possibly NH2 (broad), but at 4.0 ppm. Alternatively, OCH2 or another group.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom (like O), quartet suggests coupling to a CH3.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): para-substituted benzene.

Putting this together: ethyl group (CH2CH3), a para-substituted benzene, and a group with 2H that's either NH2 or OCH2. The carbonyl (from IR) could be part of an ester (O-CO-O) or an amide (NH-CO-O). Wait, but the molecular formula has two oxygens. Let's count: ester groups have two oxygens (O-CO-O), but if there's an amide, that's another oxygen. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So two oxygens and one nitrogen. If there's an ester group (COO), that accounts for two oxygens. Then, the nitrogen must be in an amine or amide group. If it's an amide, that would require an additional oxygen, but the formula only has two oxygens. Therefore, the nitrogen is likely in an amine group. So, perhaps the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that would require three oxygens. Let me check again.

Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is H2N-C6H4-COOH. Its molecular formula is C7H7NO2. If we esterify the -COOH with ethanol, replacing the -OH with -OCH2CH3, the formula becomes C7H7NO2 + C2H5O - H2O. The original formula of PABA is C7H7NO2. Adding ethyl group (C2H5O) and subtracting H2O (which is -H from the -COOH and -OH from ethanol), the formula becomes C7 + C2 = C9, H7 + H5 - H2 = H10, N=1, O=2 +1 -1=2. So C9H10NO2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So one hydrogen short. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hydrogen count. Let's do it step by step.

PABA: C7H7NO2. When esterified with ethanol (C2H5OH), the reaction is:

C7H7NO2 (PABA) + C2H5OH → C9H11NO2 (ethyl ester) + H2O.

So the molecular formula of the ester would be C7 + C2 = C9, H7 + H6 (from ethanol) - 2 (from H2O) = H11, N=1, O=2 +1 (from ethanol) -1 (from H2O) = O2. So yes, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be C9H11NO2. That matches the given formula. So this is a possibility.

Now, checking the NMR for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate:

- The ethyl group: OCH2CH3. The CH3 would be a triplet at ~1.2-1.4 ppm, and the OCH2 would be a quartet at ~4.1-4.3 ppm. The given NMR has 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) and 4.5 ppm (q, 2H). The quartet at 4.5 ppm is a bit upfield for an OCH2 group (usually around 4.1-4.3), but solvent or substituent effects might shift it. Alternatively, maybe there's another group adjacent.

The aromatic protons: In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is para to the ester. The amino group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it would be deshielded (upfield?), while the protons meta to the ester (which is electron-withdrawing) would be downfield. Wait, actually, the ester group is electron-withdrawing, so the protons ortho to it would be deshielded (downfield), and the amino group is electron-donating, so the protons ortho to it would be shielded (upfield). Therefore, the two protons ortho to the NH2 would be upfield (around 7.0 ppm), and the two protons ortho to the ester (COOEt) would be downfield (around 8.0 ppm). This matches the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). The coupling between these protons would be para to each other, so each pair would be a doublet (J = 8-9 Hz).

Now, the NH2 group. In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. The protons of NH2 in aromatic amines are typically broad and appear around 5-6 ppm. However, the NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). This seems lower than expected. Possible reasons could be exchange with deuterated solvent (if D2O was added, but the peak is still present) or perhaps the NH2 is part of a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not on the benzene ring but in another part of the molecule. Wait, but the molecular formula and the rest of the data suggest the structure. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is in an aliphatic position, but that would complicate the structure. Let me check the IR again. The IR shows N-H stretches at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Primary amines (aliphatic or aromatic) have two N-H stretches. In aromatic amines, the N-H stretches are slightly lower in wavenumber. The given IR bands are around 3400 cm⁻¹, which is consistent with an aromatic amine. However, the NMR shows the NH2 at 4.0 ppm, which is lower than expected. Could this be due to some exchange or solvent effect? Or maybe the NH2 is not free. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of an amide, but the carbonyl is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is higher than typical amides. Wait, the IR shows a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more indicative of an ester or ketone. If it's an ester, then the carbonyl is part of the ester group. Then, the NH2 would be on the benzene ring. The conflicting point is the NMR shift of NH2.

Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not on the benzene ring but in another part. Let's consider if there's an ethyl group attached to a nitrogen. For example, ethyl carbamate or something else. Let's think of another structure. Suppose the compound is phenacetin, which is an ethyl ester of para-ethoxyacetanilide. But phenacetin's formula is C10H13NO3. Not matching. Alternatively, lidocaine? No, formula doesn't match. Alternatively, a simple ethyl ester with an amine substituent.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is ethyl 4-aminophenylacetate. But that would have the structure CH2COOEt attached to a benzene ring with an NH2 group. But that would change the substitution pattern. The molecular formula would be C10H13NO2, which doesn't match. Alternatively, if the ester is directly attached to the benzene ring, as in ethyl benzoate with an amino group. But we already considered that and had a discrepancy in oxygen count. Wait, no—if it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the formula is C9H11NO2, which matches. Then why is the NH2 appearing at 4.0 ppm? Maybe the sample was run in DMSO-d6, and the NH2 is exchanging with residual H2O, causing it to appear broad but shifted. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is protonated, but that would be in acidic conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is part of a different group. Wait, maybe it's not NH2 but an NH group. But the integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2O- group, but that would require two oxygen atoms. The IR doesn't show strong absorption for an ether, though.

Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be an -NH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, making it less deshielded. For example, in a structure like ethyl 2-aminobenzoate (ortho isomer), but that might change the aromatic shifts. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a glycine residue, but that would complicate the structure. Alternatively, maybe the compound has a morpholine ring or similar, but that would require more oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm peak is not NH2 but another group. For example, a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen and a nitrogen, causing some splitting. But the integration is 2H. If it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen and a nitrogen, maybe in a structure like CH2NH2-O-..., but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OCH2NH2 group, but that would be a hydroxylamine derivative, which is less common.

Wait, going back to the IR data: the strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ is likely an ester (C=O stretch). The N-H stretches at ~3400 cm⁻¹ suggest an amine. So combining these, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate fits the formula and most of the data except the NH2 shift. However, maybe the NH2 protons are split into a broad peak at 4.0 ppm due to exchange broadening. In some cases, especially if the solution is not perfectly dry or if there's some exchange with solvent, the NH2 protons can appear broader and shifted. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is part of a different group. Let's check the possible shifts again.

In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 protons are attached to the benzene ring. In DMSO-d6, which is a common NMR solvent, the NH2 protons of aniline derivatives are usually around 5-6 ppm and are broad. However, if the compound is in CDCl3, and the NH2 is not deprotonated, it might appear differently. If the NH2 is in a less polar solvent, maybe the chemical shift is lower. However, 4.0 ppm still seems low. Another possibility: the NH2 group is not on the benzene ring but in another part of the molecule. For example, if there's a side chain with an NH2 group. Let's consider a structure where the benzene ring is connected to an ester group (COOEt) and a CH2NH2 group. For example, ethyl (2-aminoethyl)benzoate. The formula would be C6H5COOCH2CH2NH2. Let's count the atoms: C6 (benzene) + 2 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH2) + N = C9H11NO2. That matches. Let's check the NMR for this structure.

The ester group would have the ethyl's CH3 at 1.20 ppm (t) and OCH2 at 4.5 ppm (q). The CH2NH2 group would have the CH2 next to the NH2. The NH2 protons might appear as a broad singlet around 4.0 ppm (if the CH2 is adjacent to NH2). The aromatic protons would be a monosubstituted benzene, leading to a complex splitting pattern, but maybe in this case, it's a para-substituted ester. Wait, no—if the benzoate is in the para position relative to the CH2NH2, but that would require two substituents on the benzene ring, which would change the aromatic signals. Alternatively, if the benzoate is in the ortho position, but again, the splitting would be different. This structure might not explain the two doublets in the aromatic region. Therefore, this might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is ethyl 4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylate. But then the aromatic protons would be absent. The given NMR shows aromatic protons, so the benzene ring is present.

Given all this, the most plausible structure seems to be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, despite the discrepancy in the NH2 shift. The alternative is that the NH2 is in a different environment, but I can't think of another structure that fits the molecular formula and the rest of the data. Let's check the chemical shifts again for ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Looking up reference data:

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (also known as benzocaine) has the following NMR shifts (approximate):

- Ethyl group: CH3 at ~1.3 ppm (triplet), OCH2 at ~4.2 ppm (quartet).
- Aromatic protons: The two protons ortho to the NH2 are upfield (~6.6 ppm), and the two protons ortho to the ester are downfield (~7.8 ppm). However, in the given data, they are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which is close.
- NH2 protons: Typically broad around 5-6 ppm but might vary based on solvent and concentration.

In some cases, especially if the NH2 is deprotonated or in a different solvent, the shift could be lower. Alternatively, if the NH2 is involved in hydrogen bonding or exchange, it might appear broader and at a different shift. However, the given data shows the NH2 at 4.0 ppm, which is lower than typical. This inconsistency is puzzling. 

Wait, benzocaine's structure is indeed ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let me verify its NMR. According to literature, benzocaine's 1H NMR (CDCl3) shows:

- δ 1.35 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 3H, CH2CH3)
- δ 4.30 (q, J = 7.1 Hz, 2H, OCH2)
- δ 6.60 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H, ArH ortho to NH2)
- δ 7.85 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 2H, ArH meta to NH2)
- δ 4.08 (s, 2H, NH2) – but wait, in reality, the NH2 protons in benzocaine are typically observed around δ 3.5-4.5 ppm as a broad peak, but they might not integrate properly if they are exchanging rapidly. However, in CDCl3, the NH2 protons can be broad and sometimes not observed unless the sample is very dry. Alternatively, if the NH2 is protonated, it might appear as a broad singlet. However, in the given data, the NH2 is at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), which matches this range. The aromatic protons in the given data are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which is slightly upfield compared to literature values (6.6 and 7.8), but solvent effects can account for minor shifts. The ethyl group's signals match well: 1.20 ppm (t) and 4.5 ppm (q). The OCH2 in benzocaine is usually around 4.3 ppm, but the given data has it at 4.5 ppm. This could be due to different referencing or solvent.

Considering all this, the compound is most likely ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, commonly known as benzocaine. The NH2 protons are observed as a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which might be due to the solvent or sample conditions. The IR data supports the presence of an ester (1720 cm⁻¹) and an amine (3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹). The molecular formula matches perfectly. The NMR signals align reasonably when considering possible variations in experimental conditions.
