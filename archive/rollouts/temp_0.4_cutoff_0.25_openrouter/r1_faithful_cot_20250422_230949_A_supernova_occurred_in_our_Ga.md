# Original Question

A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.
What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?

(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)

Given a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s (0.2c) from the Galaxy's reference frame, we need to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

1. **Relativity Considerations**:
   - The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames.
   - From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center moves at 0.2c.
   - Using special relativity, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is also 0.2c.

2. **Time Dilation**:
   - The time experienced in the ejecta's frame (proper time) is 50 seconds.
   - The Lorentz factor (gamma) is calculated as:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
     \]
   - The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is:
     \[
     t = \gamma \times t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = v \times t = 60,000 \text{ km/s} \times 51.03 \text{ s} \approx 3,061,800 \text{ km}
     \]

4. **Exact Calculation**:
   - Using the exact form of gamma:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{5}{2\sqrt{6}}
     \]
   - The distance is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 60,000 \text{ km/s} \times 50 \text{ s} \times \frac{5}{2\sqrt{6}} \approx 3,061,862 \text{ km}
     \]

Thus, the ejecta travels approximately \(\boxed{3.06 \times 10^6}\) kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so there's this problem about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. The question is asking how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Both frames are considered inertial, which probably means we can use special relativity here. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's parse the given information. The ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center at 60,000 km/s from the Galaxy's frame. Wait, actually, the problem says that from the ejecta's reference frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at that speed. But we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm. So, there's a time dilation effect here because the two frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 m/s. The speed of light is approximately 300,000,000 m/s. So, 60,000 km/s is 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2 times the speed of light. So, beta (v/c) is 0.2. That's actually not too high, but still, relativistic effects might be noticeable. But maybe for 50 seconds, even with that speed, the distance might be straightforward. Wait, but we have to consider whose time we're talking about. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to figure out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame, or maybe use the velocity to calculate the distance.

Wait, but the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at 0.2c. Then, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center. But wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just switch signs like that. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c (towards the ejecta), then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at +0.2c towards the center. But actually, in special relativity, velocity addition is a bit more involved if there are other velocities, but here, since they are directly approaching each other along the same line, maybe it's just the inverse. Wait, but if they are inertial frames moving at velocity v relative to each other, then each frame sees the other moving at velocity v in the opposite direction. So, if in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So, maybe we don't need to adjust the speed due to relativity? Wait, but that can't be right because velocities don't just add like that in relativity. Wait, but if the frames are moving at speed v relative to each other, then each sees the other moving at speed v in the opposite direction. So, if the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c in the ejecta's frame, then the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame. So, maybe the speed is indeed 0.2c in both frames. But that seems contradictory because in Galilean relativity, that would be the case, but in special relativity, velocities don't add that way. Wait, maybe I need to recall the velocity transformation.

The velocity transformation in special relativity is given by:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/c²)

Where u is the velocity in the original frame, and v is the relative velocity between the frames. But here, if we consider the Galaxy frame as S and the ejecta frame as S', moving at velocity v towards the center (so in S frame, ejecta is moving at v towards the center). Then in the S' frame (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy center is moving at velocity u' = -v / (1 - v²/c²) ?

Wait, maybe I need to get this straight. Let me set up the frames. Let's take the Galaxy frame as the rest frame, S. The ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center (which we can take as the positive x direction). Then, in the ejecta's frame, S', the Galaxy center is moving towards the ejecta at velocity u'. According to the problem, u' is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c. So, we can use the velocity transformation formula to find what v is. Because in the S frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the center, and in the S' frame, the Galaxy center is moving at u' = -v / (1 - (v^2/c^2)) ?

Wait, no, maybe I need to recall the correct formula. The velocity transformation formula from S to S' (where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the x-axis) is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

In this case, in the Galaxy frame (S), the Galaxy center is at rest (u = 0), and the ejecta is moving towards it at velocity v. Then, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the velocity of the Galaxy center (u') would be:

u' = (0 - v) / (1 - (0 * v)/c² ) = -v / (1) = -v

But according to the problem, u' is -0.2c (since it's moving towards the ejecta). Therefore, that would imply that -v = -0.2c, so v = 0.2c. Therefore, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center. Therefore, the speed is 0.2c in the Galaxy frame.

Wait, but that seems like the Galilean result. But according to special relativity, if the frames are moving at velocity v relative to each other, then each sees the other moving at velocity -v. But that's only in the case where velocities are non-relativistic? Wait, no. Wait, in special relativity, if frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then in S, the coordinates of S' are moving at velocity v. In S', the frame S is moving at velocity -v. But that's just the relative velocity. However, when transforming velocities of objects, it's different. Wait, but in this case, the Galaxy center is at rest in S, so its velocity in S is 0. Then, in S', its velocity is calculated using the Lorentz transformation. So, using the formula:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² )

If u = 0 (Galaxy center at rest in S), then u' = -v / (1 - 0) = -v. Therefore, the Galaxy center is moving at velocity -v in S'. But according to the problem statement, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy center is moving at 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c. Therefore, -v = -0.2c => v = 0.2c. Therefore, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. Therefore, the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is 0.2c. So, the problem is essentially saying that the relative speed between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 0.2c. Therefore, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center, and in the ejecta frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c towards the ejecta.

Therefore, if the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds, we need to find how much time elapses in the Galaxy's frame, and then compute the distance as v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame? Or wait, no. Wait, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is just its speed in the Galaxy's frame multiplied by the time duration in the Galaxy's frame. However, the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame using time dilation, then multiply by velocity to get the distance.

But wait, time dilation relates the proper time (in the moving frame) to the coordinate time in the rest frame. The proper time is the time experienced in the moving frame. So, if the ejecta is moving at 0.2c relative to the Galaxy, then the time dilation factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute gamma for v = 0.2c.

v = 0.2c

v²/c² = 0.04

1 - v²/c² = 0.96

sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798

gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206

So, gamma is approximately 1.0206.

Time dilation formula is:

t = gamma * t'

Where t is the time in the Galaxy frame (since the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the Galaxy frame, so the ejecta's time is the proper time t').

Wait, actually, time dilation is such that the moving clock runs slower. So, if the ejecta's frame is moving at v relative to the Galaxy, then the Galaxy's frame sees the ejecta's clock running slow. Conversely, the ejecta sees the Galaxy's clock running slow.

Wait, but in this case, the time we have is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, t' = 50 seconds (proper time in the ejecta's frame). Then, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame would be t = gamma * t', because the ejecta's clock is moving relative to the Galaxy, so the Galaxy sees the ejecta's clock as running slow. Therefore, if 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, the Galaxy's clock would measure more time, specifically t = gamma * t'.

But wait, actually, the time dilation formula is t = gamma * t' only when the events occur at the same location in the moving frame (i.e., t' is the proper time). If the events (start and end of the 50 seconds) occur at the same location in the ejecta's frame, then in the Galaxy's frame, they are separated by gamma * t' in time and gamma * v * t' in space. However, in this case, the ejecta is moving in the Galaxy's frame, so the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) are not at the same spatial coordinate in the Galaxy's frame. Therefore, we need to use the Lorentz transformation to find the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Alternatively, since we need to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame, which would be velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. However, the velocity is 0.2c, and the time in the Galaxy's frame can be found by considering the time dilation and the fact that the ejecta is moving.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the Lorentz transformation between the two frames. Let's denote the Galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S', moving at velocity v = 0.2c towards the Galaxy center (which we'll take as the positive x direction). The two events we are considering are: Event 1 - ejecta starts moving; Event 2 - 50 seconds later in the ejecta's frame.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), these two events occur at the same spatial coordinate (since the ejecta is at rest in S'), so the coordinates are (x', t') = (0, 0) and (0, 50 s). We need to transform these events to the Galaxy's frame (S) using the Lorentz transformation:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

x = gamma (x' + v t')

But since x' = 0 for both events, this simplifies to:

For Event 1: t1 = gamma * 0 = 0, x1 = gamma * 0 = 0.

For Event 2: t2 = gamma * 50 s, x2 = gamma * v * 50 s.

Therefore, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is t2 - t1 = gamma * 50 s. The position of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame at t2 is x2 = gamma * v * 50 s. Therefore, the distance traveled is x2 - x1 = gamma * v * 50 s.

But wait, but according to the problem, we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v = 0.2c, and the time between the two events (which are 50 seconds apart in the ejecta's frame) is gamma * 50 seconds. Therefore, the distance is v * gamma * 50 s.

But let's compute that.

First, compute gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206

So, gamma ≈ 1.0206

Then, time in Galaxy frame: t = gamma * 50 ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds

Then, distance = v * t = 0.2c * 51.03 s

But 0.2c is 60,000 km/s (as given in the problem). Wait, yes:

c = 300,000 km/s, so 0.2c = 60,000 km/s.

Therefore, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km

But wait, but let me check the calculation again. Because another way to compute x2 is gamma * v * t'. Since x' = 0, the position in the Galaxy frame is x = gamma * v t'.

So, x = gamma * v * t' = 1.0206 * 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 1.0206 * 3,000,000 km ≈ 3,061,800 km

So, approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

But let me verify if this approach is correct. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c. So, in the ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy center travels in 50 seconds is 0.2c * 50 s = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. Therefore, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center moves 3 million km towards the ejecta. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c, and the time elapsed is longer due to time dilation, leading to a longer distance. So, the answer here is approximately 3.06 million km, which is 3,061,800 km. But the problem might expect an exact value instead of an approximate one.

Let me compute gamma exactly. Let's see:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ 4.89898/5 ≈ 0.9798, as before.

So, gamma = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) ≈ 1.0206

But to keep it exact, gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(24/25)) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = 5 sqrt(6) / 12 ≈ 1.0206

Therefore, the exact distance is:

gamma * v * t' = (5 / (2*sqrt(6))) * 0.2c * 50

But 0.2c is given as 60,000 km/s, so:

gamma * 60,000 km/s * 50 s = (5 / (2*sqrt(6))) * 3,000,000 km

But maybe they want the answer in terms of exact expression or approximate decimal. Let's compute this:

First, compute 5 / (2*sqrt(6)):

sqrt(6) ≈ 2.4495

2*sqrt(6) ≈ 4.899

5 / 4.899 ≈ 1.0206

So, gamma ≈ 1.0206

Therefore, gamma * 3,000,000 km ≈ 1.0206 * 3,000,000 ≈ 3,061,800 km

So, approximately 3.0618 x 10^6 km.

But the problem may want an exact answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach where we don't need to consider gamma. Wait, but why?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's think again. The problem states that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy travels a distance of 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance should be different. But due to length contraction or something else.

Wait, perhaps we need to consider that in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the Galaxy center is contracted. Wait, but the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. Hmm.

Alternatively, since both frames are inertial, we can use the Lorentz transformation for the displacement. The displacement in the Galaxy's frame would be:

x = gamma (x' + v t')

But in the ejecta's frame, the displacement of the ejecta is x' = 0 (since it's at rest in its own frame). Therefore, over 50 seconds, the ejecta doesn't move in its own frame. However, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v, so its displacement is gamma * v t'. Wait, but according to the Lorentz transformation, if the events are at (0,0) and (0,50) in S', then in S, the coordinates are (gamma*v*50, gamma*50). Therefore, the displacement is gamma*v*50, and the time elapsed is gamma*50. Therefore, the distance is v * gamma *50. So, same as before.

But why is the displacement gamma*v*t'? Because in the S' frame, the position is always x'=0, so in S frame, x = gamma*(x' + v t') = gamma*v t'. Therefore, the distance traveled is x = gamma*v*t'.

Therefore, the answer is gamma*v*t', which is approximately 1.0206 * 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,061,800 km. But maybe we need to calculate it more precisely.

Alternatively, let's compute gamma exactly:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(24/25)) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)).

Therefore, gamma = 5/(2*sqrt(6)).

Then, distance x = gamma * v * t' = (5/(2*sqrt(6))) * 60,000 km/s * 50 s.

Compute this:

First, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.

Then, x = (5/(2*sqrt(6))) * 3,000,000 km.

Multiply 5/2 = 2.5, so 2.5 / sqrt(6) * 3,000,000 km.

2.5 / sqrt(6) ≈ 2.5 / 2.4495 ≈ 1.0206

Multiply by 3,000,000 ≈ 3,061,800 km.

Alternatively, rationalizing the denominator:

5/(2*sqrt(6)) = (5*sqrt(6))/(2*6) = (5*sqrt(6))/12 ≈ (5*2.4495)/12 ≈ 12.2475/12 ≈ 1.0206, same as before.

Therefore, the exact distance is (5*sqrt(6)/12) * 3,000,000 km = (3,000,000 * 5 * sqrt(6)) / 12

Simplify:

3,000,000 / 12 = 250,000

So, 250,000 * 5 * sqrt(6) = 1,250,000 * sqrt(6) km

But sqrt(6) ≈ 2.4495, so 1,250,000 * 2.4495 ≈ 3,061,875 km

So, approximately 3.061875 x 10^6 km, which rounds to about 3,061,800 km.

But the problem might expect an exact answer in terms of sqrt(6), or maybe just the approximate value. However, given that the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s, which is exactly 0.2c, and the time is 50 seconds, the answer is 60,000 * 50 * gamma km, which is 3,000,000 * gamma km. Since gamma is 1.0206, the exact answer is 3,000,000 * 5/(2*sqrt(6)) km.

Alternatively, if we use c = 3 x 10^5 km/s (since 300,000 km/s is 3 x 10^5 km/s), then 0.2c = 60,000 km/s. Then, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96). So, 0.96 is 24/25, so sqrt(24/25) = (2*sqrt(6))/5. Therefore, gamma = 5/(2*sqrt(6)).

Therefore, the exact distance is:

x = v * gamma * t' = (0.2c) * (5/(2*sqrt(6))) * t'

But since 0.2c = 60,000 km/s, and t' = 50 s:

x = 60,000 km/s * 50 s * (5/(2*sqrt(6))) = 3,000,000 km * (5/(2*sqrt(6))) = (15,000,000 km) / (2*sqrt(6)) = (7,500,000 km)/sqrt(6)

Rationalizing the denominator:

x = 7,500,000 km * sqrt(6)/6 = (7,500,000 / 6) * sqrt(6) km ≈ 1,250,000 * 2.4495 km ≈ 3,061,875 km

But perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of exact gamma, but since the given numbers are all in decimal, maybe the approximate value is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 60,000 km/s. Therefore, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy center is approaching at that speed. Then, the question is, in the Galaxy's frame, how far does the ejecta move when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

But in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So, in the Galaxy's frame, due to time dilation, more time has passed. Therefore, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s (as per the earlier conclusion), and the time elapsed in Galaxy's frame is gamma * 50 s. Therefore, distance is 60,000 km/s * gamma * 50 s.

But that's the same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. If we ignore relativity and just use Galilean transformation, then the distance would be 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But since the speed is 0.2c, which is 20% the speed of light, relativistic effects might be noticeable. Therefore, the answer should consider gamma, leading to approximately 3,061,800 km.

But let's check what the actual effect is. The gamma factor is about 1.02, so the correction is about 2%. Therefore, the distance is about 2% more than the non-relativistic case.

But the problem says that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Therefore, we must use special relativity. Hence, the answer should be approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

But let me check if there's another approach where the distance is contracted. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 0.2c, covering 3,000,000 km in 50 seconds. But in the Galaxy's frame, the distance would be different. Wait, but the problem is not about the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy center; it's about how much the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds of ejecta's time.

Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and the time elapsed is gamma * 50 s. Therefore, the distance is 0.2c * gamma * 50 s. Which is what we calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps using proper acceleration or something else, but the problem states to ignore gravity, so it's just inertial motion. Therefore, the ejecta is moving at constant velocity, so distance is velocity multiplied by time. But the time is different in different frames.

Therefore, the answer is gamma * v * t', which is approximately 3,061,800 km.

But maybe the problem expects the answer as 3,000,000 km, ignoring relativity? But given that the speed is 0.2c, which is significant, and the problem mentions they are inertial frames, implying that relativity should be considered. Therefore, the correct answer should be the one considering gamma.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the reference frames. Let me verify once more.

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c. So, in the ejecta's frame, in 50 seconds, the Galaxy center moves 0.2c * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 0.2c, but the time experienced by the ejecta is 50 seconds. Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer by gamma, so the distance is 0.2c * gamma * 50.

Yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is approximately 3,061,800 km. Rounded to, say, three significant figures, it would be 3.06 x 10^6 km, or 3,060,000 km. But given that gamma is approximately 1.0206, multiplying 3,000,000 by 1.0206 gives 3,061,800.

Alternatively, if we compute more precisely:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

So, 1.020620726 * 3,000,000 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

So, approximately 3,061,862 km. Depending on the desired precision, but the problem might want an exact answer in terms of sqrt(6), but probably expects the numerical value.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame, and the proper time experienced by the ejecta is 50 seconds. The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. The relation between proper time (tau) and coordinate time (t) is given by:

tau = t / gamma

Therefore, t = tau * gamma

Hence, distance = v * t = v * tau * gamma

Which is the same as before.

Therefore, distance = 0.2c * 50 s * gamma ≈ 0.2 * 3e5 km/s * 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 3e5 * 0.2 = 6e4 km/s, 6e4 * 50 = 3e6 km, 3e6 * 1.0206 ≈ 3.0618e6 km.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

But let me check with exact numbers:

v = 60,000 km/s

tau = 50 s

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (60,000 / 300,000)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)

distance = v * tau * gamma = 60,000 * 50 / sqrt(0.96) = 3,000,000 / sqrt(0.96)

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5 = (2*sqrt(6))/5

Therefore, distance = 3,000,000 / (2*sqrt(6)/5) = 3,000,000 * 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = (15,000,000) / (2*sqrt(6)) = 7,500,000 / sqrt(6)

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(6):

distance = 7,500,000 * sqrt(6) / 6 = 1,250,000 * sqrt(6)

sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449489743

Therefore, distance ≈ 1,250,000 * 2.449489743 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

So, approximately 3,061,862 km. If we round to three significant figures, it's 3.06 x 10^6 km or 3,060,000 km. But given that the problem states the velocity as 60,000 km/s (two significant figures?) and the time as 50 seconds (one significant figure?), but actually, 60,000 km/s could be two or five significant figures depending on notation. However, written as "60 000 km/s" with a space, it's likely five significant figures. Similarly, 50 seconds is two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should have two significant figures: 3.1 x 10^6 km or 3,100,000 km. Wait, but 50 is two significant figures, 60,000 is two as well (if written as 6.0 x 10^4), but in the problem statement, it's written as "60 000 km/s", which in some notations (using space as thousand separator) would be 60,000, which is two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be given to two significant figures: 3.1 million kilometers, which is 3.1 x 10^6 km.

But wait, 3,061,862 is approximately 3.06 million, which is three significant figures. If the inputs are two significant figures (60,000 and 50), then the answer should be two significant figures: 3.1 x 10^6 km.

But maybe the problem expects an exact relativistic result without approximating gamma. Let me check with exact calculation:

distance = 1,250,000 * sqrt(6) km

sqrt(6) is irrational, so we can leave it as sqrt(6) if needed, but the problem probably expects a numerical answer. Given that, and since the options might require a certain precision, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll go with the approximate value of 3.06 x 10^6 km, which is 3,060,000 km.

But my detailed calculation gave approximately 3,061,862 km, which is 3.061862 x 10^6 km. Depending on rounding, this could be 3.06 million, 3.06 x 10^6 km, or 3.062 million. Since the problem may expect an answer in kilometers with comma separators, maybe 3,060,000 or 3,062,000. But in the calculation, it's approximately 3,061,862, so 3,061,862 km.

But I need to check if my initial assumption that the velocity in the Galaxy frame is 0.2c is correct. Let me confirm.

From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c. In special relativity, if two frames are moving at velocity v relative to each other, each sees the other moving at velocity -v. But this is only true in Galilean relativity. In special relativity, velocities transform according to the Lorentz transformation.

Wait, let's use the velocity transformation formula. If in frame S' (ejecta), the velocity of the Galaxy center is u' = -0.2c (negative because it's moving towards the ejecta). Then, the velocity in frame S (Galaxy) is u = ?

The velocity transformation formula is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

But here, v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S (Galaxy). So, if the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the Galaxy center in S, then the velocity of the Galaxy center in S' is u' = -v / (1 - v²/c² )? Wait, no.

Wait, the correct formula is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

In this case, we want to find the velocity of the Galaxy center in S' (ejecta's frame), which is u' = -0.2c. The velocity v is the speed of S' relative to S, which is the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, which is what we need to find.

But we can rearrange the formula. We have u' = -0.2c, and in the Galaxy's frame (S), the Galaxy center is at rest, so u = 0.

Wait, no. Wait, the Galaxy center is at rest in S, so in S, the Galaxy center's velocity is 0. Then, in S', its velocity is u' = ?

Using the velocity transformation formula:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

Here, u = 0 (Galaxy center's velocity in S), and v is the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S.

Therefore, u' = (0 - v) / (1 - 0) = -v

But according to the problem, u' = -0.2c. Therefore, -v = -0.2c => v = 0.2c.

Therefore, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is 0.2c, confirming our initial result. Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the distance is indeed gamma * v * t' ≈ 3,061,862 km.

Since the problem gives velocity as 60,000 km/s and time as 50 seconds, which are both exact values (assuming 60,000 is exact), then the answer should be the exact expression or the approximate decimal. Given that, the answer is approximately 3,061,862 km. However, since the problem may expect rounding to two decimal places or significant figures, but given the numbers, I think the precise answer is 3,000,000 multiplied by 5/(2*sqrt(6)), which is approximately 3,061,862 km.

But perhaps the problem expects the answer as 3,000,000 km, disregarding relativity. But given that it's a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.2c), and the problem mentions inertial frames, it's more appropriate to use special relativity. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Since in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c, and 50 seconds pass, the distance in the ejecta's frame is 0.2c * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, this distance is length contracted. Therefore, the actual distance would be longer by gamma. So, distance in Galaxy's frame is gamma * 3,000,000 km ≈ 3,061,862 km. This is another way to think about it, but it arrives at the same result.

Yes, because in the ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy center moves is 3,000,000 km. In the Galaxy's frame, this distance is length contracted, so the proper distance (in the Galaxy's frame) would be gamma times that. Therefore, same result.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3,061,862 km. Given that, and the problem likely expecting a numerical answer, I think this is the correct result.

**Final Answer**
The ejecta travels approximately \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so there's this problem about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. The question is asking how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Both frames are considered inertial, which probably means we can use special relativity here. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's parse the given information. The ejecta is moving towards the Galactic center at 60,000 km/s from the Galaxy's frame. Wait, actually, the problem says that from the ejecta's reference frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at that speed. But we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm. So, there's a time dilation effect here because the two frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 m/s. The speed of light is approximately 300,000,000 m/s. So, 60,000 km/s is 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2 times the speed of light. So, beta (v/c) is 0.2. That's actually not too high, but still, relativistic effects might be noticeable. But maybe for 50 seconds, even with that speed, the distance might be straightforward. Wait, but we have to consider whose time we're talking about. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to figure out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame, or maybe use the velocity to calculate the distance.

Wait, but the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at 0.2c. Then, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center. But wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just switch signs like that. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c (towards the ejecta), then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at +0.2c towards the center. But actually, in special relativity, velocity addition is a bit more involved if there are other velocities, but here, since they are directly approaching each other along the same line, maybe it's just the inverse. Wait, but if they are inertial frames moving at velocity v relative to each other, then each frame sees the other moving at velocity v in the opposite direction. So, if in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the ejecta, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So, maybe we don't need to adjust the speed due to relativity? Wait, but that can't be right because velocities don't just add like that in relativity. Wait, but if the frames are moving at speed v relative to each other, then each sees the other moving at speed v in the opposite direction. So, if the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c in the ejecta's frame, then the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame. So, maybe the speed is indeed 0.2c in both frames. But that seems contradictory because in Galilean relativity, that would be the case, but in special relativity, velocities don't add that way. Wait, maybe I need to recall the velocity transformation.

The velocity transformation in special relativity is given by:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/c²)

Where u is the velocity in the original frame, and v is the relative velocity between the frames. But here, if we consider the Galaxy frame as S and the ejecta frame as S', moving at velocity v towards the center (so in S frame, ejecta is moving at v towards the center). Then in the S' frame (ejecta's frame), the Galaxy center is moving at velocity u' = -v / (1 - v²/c²) ?

Wait, maybe I need to get this straight. Let me set up the frames. Let's take the Galaxy frame as the rest frame, S. The ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center (which we can take as the positive x direction). Then, in the ejecta's frame, S', the Galaxy center is moving towards the ejecta at velocity u'. According to the problem, u' is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c. So, we can use the velocity transformation formula to find what v is. Because in the S frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the center, and in the S' frame, the Galaxy center is moving at u' = -v / (1 - (v^2/c^2)) ?

Wait, no, maybe I need to recall the correct formula. The velocity transformation formula from S to S' (where S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the x-axis) is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

In this case, in the Galaxy frame (S), the Galaxy center is at rest (u = 0), and the ejecta is moving towards it at velocity v. Then, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the velocity of the Galaxy center (u') would be:

u' = (0 - v) / (1 - (0 * v)/c² ) = -v / (1) = -v

But according to the problem, u' is -0.2c (since it's moving towards the ejecta). Therefore, that would imply that -v = -0.2c, so v = 0.2c. Therefore, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center. Therefore, the speed is 0.2c in the Galaxy frame.

Wait, but that seems like the Galilean result. But according to special relativity, if the frames are moving at velocity v relative to each other, then each sees the other moving at velocity -v. But that's only in the case where velocities are non-relativistic? Wait, no. Wait, in special relativity, if frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then in S, the coordinates of S' are moving at velocity v. In S', the frame S is moving at velocity -v. But that's just the relative velocity. However, when transforming velocities of objects, it's different. Wait, but in this case, the Galaxy center is at rest in S, so its velocity in S is 0. Then, in S', its velocity is calculated using the Lorentz transformation. So, using the formula:

u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² )

If u = 0 (Galaxy center at rest in S), then u' = -v / (1 - 0) = -v. Therefore, the Galaxy center is moving at velocity -v in S'. But according to the problem statement, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy center is moving at 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c. Therefore, -v = -0.2c => v = 0.2c. Therefore, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. Therefore, the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame is 0.2c. So, the problem is essentially saying that the relative speed between the ejecta and the Galaxy is 0.2c. Therefore, in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center, and in the ejecta frame, the Galaxy is moving at 0.2c towards the ejecta.

Therefore, if the time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds, we need to find how much time elapses in the Galaxy's frame, and then compute the distance as v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame? Or wait, no. Wait, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is just its speed in the G

In this problem, we're considering a supernova ejecta moving toward the Galactic center. The question asks how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame during 50 seconds of time in the ejecta's own reference frame. Both frames are considered inertial, suggesting we need to apply special relativity principles.

According to the problem, from the ejecta's perspective, the center of the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. This speed equals 60,000,000 m/s, which is 0.2 times the speed of light (c = 300,000,000 m/s). So beta (v/c) equals 0.2.

I need to determine the relative motion between the two frames. In special relativity, if frame S' (the ejecta) is moving at velocity v relative to frame S (the Galaxy), then in S, the coordinates of S' move at velocity v, while in S', frame S moves at velocity -v. 

To verify this, I can use the velocity transformation formula from special relativity:
u' = (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²)

Since the Galactic center is stationary in the Galaxy frame (u = 0), its velocity in the ejecta frame would be:
u' = (0 - v)/(1 - 0) = -v

The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center approaches at 0.2c, meaning -v = -0.2c, therefore v = 0.2c. This confirms that in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c toward the center.

Now, with 50 seconds passing in the ejecta's frame, I need to determine how much time elapses in the Galaxy's frame, then calculate the distance traveled as velocity × time. The time dilation effect must be considered since the two frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of light speed.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, so there's this scenario involving a supernova ejecta moving towards the Galactic center. The question asks how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame in the time it experiences as 50 seconds. Both frames are inertial, so we can likely apply special relativity here. Let's break this down step by step.

Firstly, let's understand the given details. From the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. On the other hand, from the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy moves towards it at 60,000 km/s. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center approaches at that speed. What's needed is the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. This implies there's time dilation because the frames are moving relative to each other at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Now, 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 m/s. The speed of light is about 300,000,000 m/s. So, 60,000 km/s is 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2 times the speed of light, which is β = 0.2. This isn't exceedingly high, but relativistic effects are present. Even if 50 seconds feels straightforward at that speed, we must consider which time frame we're referring to. Since 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, we must determine how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame to compute the distance.

While the question is about the distance in the Galaxy's frame, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 60,000 km/s, or 0.2c. Hence, in the Galaxy's reference frame, the ejecta should move towards the center at 0.2c. However, relativity tells us velocities don't simply switch signs. If the Galaxy center is moving at -0.2c towards the ejecta in its frame, then the ejecta moves at +0.2c towards the center in the Galaxy's frame.

Special relativity makes velocity addition more complex, but here they approach directly along the same line, so the inverse could apply. If frames move at speed v relative to each other, each frame sees the other moving at speed v in the opposite direction. Thus, if the Galaxy center moves at 0.2c in the ejecta's frame, the ejecta indeed moves at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame. Speeds aren't added normally in relativity, so recalling the velocity transformation is essential.

The special relativity velocity transformation is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - uv/c²),

where u is the original frame's velocity, v is the relative velocity between frames. Here if we assign Galaxy frame as S and ejecta frame as S', with v as the velocity towards the center, then in S', the Galaxy center moves at u' = -v / (1 - v²/c²), but more straightforward, u' = -v.

Given u' = -0.2c, -v = -0.2c, so v = 0.2c. Thus in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta moves at 0.2c towards the center. This should be the final speed in the Galaxy frame.

To determine the distance traversed in the Galaxy's frame, calculate the time that passes there, then find the distance as v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. Thus, the distance isn't solely the perceived speed in either frame, but when taken into account with time dilation, provides a proper measure within the context of special relativity.

But the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta\'s frame. So, we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy\'s frame, which would be affected by time dilation.\n\nWait, time dilation formula is Δt = γ Δτ, where Δτ is the proper time (time in the moving frame, here the ejecta\'s frame), and γ is the Lorentz factor. So, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v = 0.2c, then v²/c² = 0.04, so 1 - 0.04 = 0.96, sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.98, so γ ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0206. Therefore, Δt = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds. So, in the Galaxy\'s frame, approximately 51.03 seconds have passed. Therefore, the distance the ejecta travels is v * Δt = 0.2c * 51.03 s. Since c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. But wait, but hold on, maybe there\'s a different approach here. Because the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy\'s frame, and the time experienced in the ejecta\'s frame is 50 seconds. So, in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is approaching at 0.2c. But the question is how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy\'s frame during the 50 seconds of the ejecta\'s time. So, the time in the Galaxy\'s frame is longer due to time dilation. So, the time in Galaxy frame is γ times the proper time. Then, distance is v multiplied by that. So, that gives us 0.2c * γ * 50 s.\n\nBut let me check the exact calculation. Let\'s compute γ when v = 0.2c.\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.\n\nSo, Δt = γ * Δτ = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, distance is v * Δt = 0.2c * 51.03 s.\n\nSince c = 3e5 km/s,\n\n0.2 * 3e5 km/s = 6e4 km/s.\n\nSo, 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 6e4 * 5.103e1 ≈ 6 * 5.103e5 ≈ 30.618e5 km ≈ 3.0618e6 km, which is 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut wait, but maybe there\'s another way to think about this. In the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c, so in 50 seconds, the distance covered by the Galaxy center in the ejecta\'s frame is 0.2c * 50 s. Then, perhaps we can relate that to the distance in the Galaxy\'s frame. But since the two frames are moving relative to each other, lengths are contracted. Wait, but in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so the distance it covers is v * t. In the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at v, so the distance is v * t\'. But due to length contraction, the distance between the Galaxy center and the ejecta in the ejecta\'s frame is contracted by γ. Hmm. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lorentz transformations. Let\'s denote the two events: event A is the ejecta at some position and time (say, at the moment the supernova occurs), and event B is the ejecta having moved towards the center after 50 seconds in its own frame. We need to find the spatial separation between these two events in the Galaxy\'s frame.\n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), event A is at (x\', t\') = (0, 0). Event B is at (x\', t\') = (0, 50), since the ejecta is at rest in its own frame. Now, we need to transform these coordinates to the Galaxy\'s frame (S), which is moving at velocity v = -0.2c relative to S\' (since in S\', the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c, so S is moving at +0.2c relative to S\'). Wait, actually, the ejecta is moving at +0.2c in the Galaxy\'s frame, so the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c in the ejecta\'s frame. Therefore, the Lorentz transformation from S\' to S is:\n\nx = γ(x\' + v t\')\n\nt = γ(t\' + (v x\')/c² )\n\nSince in the ejecta\'s frame, the two events are at (0, 0) and (0, 50). So, for event B, x\' = 0, t\' = 50.\n\nTherefore, x = γ(0 + v * 50) = γ v * 50\n\nt = γ(50 + (v * 0)/c² ) = γ * 50\n\nTherefore, in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta has moved a distance of x = γ v * 50, and the time elapsed is t = γ * 50.\n\nBut wait, but in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v, so the distance should be x = v * t. Let\'s check:\n\nx = γ v * 50\n\nt = γ * 50\n\nTherefore, x = v * t. So, that\'s consistent. Because in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving at v, so distance is v multiplied by time in Galaxy\'s frame. Since t = γ * 50, then x = v * γ * 50. So, that\'s the same as the Lorentz transformation result. Therefore, the distance is v * γ * t\', where t\' is the time in the ejecta\'s frame. Therefore, the answer is 0.2c * γ * 50.\n\nBut let\'s compute that. Since 0.2c is 6e4 km/s, and γ ≈ 1.0206, so 6e4 km/s * 1.0206 * 50 s = 6e4 * 1.0206 * 50.\n\nFirst compute 6e4 * 50 = 3e6.\n\nThen multiply by 1.0206: 3e6 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km.\n\nSo, approximately 3.0618 million kilometers.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s any mistake here. So, in the ejecta\'s frame, 50 seconds pass. The ejecta is at rest in its own frame, so in that time, the Galaxy center moves towards it at 0.2c. Therefore, the distance the Galaxy center moves is 0.2c * 50 s = 6e4 km/s * 50 s = 3e6 km. But in the Galaxy\'s frame, this distance is length contracted. Wait, but the distance in the ejecta\'s frame is the contracted version of the distance in the Galaxy\'s frame. Because in the Galaxy\'s frame, the distance between the ejecta and the center is longer. Wait, maybe that\'s another approach.\n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving 3e6 km in 50 seconds. But in the Galaxy\'s frame, this distance is actually longer by a factor of γ. Because length contraction means that in the moving frame (ejecta\'s frame), lengths are contracted. So, the proper length (in Galaxy\'s frame) would be γ times the length measured in the ejecta\'s frame. Therefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy\'s frame is γ * 3e6 km ≈ 1.0206 * 3e6 ≈ 3,061,800 km. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, both methods give the same answer, which is approximately 3.06 million kilometers.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s any other relativistic effect I might be missing here. For instance, is the velocity addition correct? The problem states that in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, that\'s 0.2c. Then, in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. So, there\'s no need for velocity transformation here because when two frames are moving relative to each other at velocity v, each sees the other moving at velocity v in the opposite direction. However, this is only exactly true in Galilean relativity. But in special relativity, the velocity transformation is different. Wait, but in the case where the object being measured is at rest in one frame, then the velocity transformation does reduce to -v. For example, if an object is at rest in the Galaxy\'s frame, then in the ejecta\'s frame, it\'s moving at -v. Similarly, if the ejecta is at rest in its own frame, then in the Galaxy\'s frame, it\'s moving at +v. Therefore, the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy\'s frame is indeed 0.2c. Therefore, the initial calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the distance is v * γ * t\' where t\' is 50 seconds, so 0.2c * γ * 50. Which gives us approximately 3.06 million kilometers.\n\nBut let\'s compute it more precisely. Let\'s calculate γ exactly. v = 0.2c, so:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (2 * sqrt(6))/5 ≈ (2 * 2.449)/5 ≈ 4.898/5 ≈ 0.9796\n\nTherefore, γ ≈ 1 / 0.9796 ≈ 1.02062\n\nSo, γ ≈ 1.02062\n\nTherefore, Δt = 1.02062 * 50 ≈ 51.031 seconds\n\nThen, distance = 0.2c * 51.031 s\n\n0.2c = 0.2 * 299,792 km/s ≈ 59,958.4 km/s\n\nThen, 59,958.4 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ ?\n\nFirst, multiply 59,958.4 * 50 = 2,997,920 km\n\nThen, 59,958.4 * 1.031 ≈ 59,958.4 * 1 = 59,958.4\n\nPlus 59,958.4 * 0.031 ≈ 59,958.4 * 0.03 = 1,798.752\n\nPlus 59,958.4 * 0.001 = 59.9584\n\nTotal ≈ 59,958.4 + 1,798.752 + 59.9584 ≈ 61,817.11 km\n\nTherefore, total distance ≈ 2,997,920 + 61,817.11 ≈ 3,059,737.11 km\n\nSo, approximately 3,059,737 km. Which is roughly 3.06 million kilometers.\n\nTherefore, rounding to a reasonable number of significant figures, since the given velocity is 60,000 km/s (which is two significant figures), and the time is 50 seconds (also two significant figures), the answer should be approximately 3.1 million kilometers. But let\'s see. The exact value is about 3,059,737 km, which is 3.059737 x 10^6 km. So, to two significant figures, that\'s 3.1 x 10^6 km. But the problem states the velocity as 60,000 km/s, which is 6 x 10^4 km/s, so one significant figure? Wait, 60,000 could be two significant figures if the trailing zeros are significant, but in most cases, without a decimal, trailing zeros are ambiguous. However, in scientific notation, 60,000 km/s would be 6 x 10^4 km/s (one significant figure) or 6.0 x 10^4 km/s (two significant figures). Since the problem says "60,000 km/s", it\'s possible they consider it two significant figures. The time is 50 seconds, which is also ambiguous, but could be one or two. If both are two significant figures, then the answer should be 3.1 million km. If the velocity is one and the time is one, then 3 x 10^6 km. But given that 60,000 is written as two, maybe they expect two sig figs.\n\nBut let me check the exact calculation again. If we use 60,000 km/s exactly (so taking 60,000 as precise), and 50 seconds as precise, then the exact answer would be:\n\n60,000 km/s * 50 s * γ\n\nBut γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nSo, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000\n\n3,000,000 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km\n\nSo, approximately 3,061,862 km. Which is 3.061862 x 10^6 km.\n\nSo, approximately 3.06 million kilometers. Depending on the desired precision, this could be 3.06 million, 3.1 million, or 3.06 x 10^6 km.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact answer using exact fractions. Let\'s see:\n\nSince γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(24/25) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) ≈ 5 / 4.89898 ≈ 1.0206\n\nBut perhaps we can keep it symbolic:\n\nγ = 5 / (2*sqrt(6))\n\nSo, distance = v * γ * t\' = 0.2c * (5 / (2*sqrt(6))) * t\'\n\nBut 0.2c = c/5, so:\n\ndistance = (c/5) * (5 / (2*sqrt(6))) * t\' = c / (2*sqrt(6)) * t\'\n\nThen, plugging in t\' = 50 seconds:\n\ndistance = (c * 50) / (2*sqrt(6)) = (50 c) / (2*sqrt(6)) = (25 c) / sqrt(6)\n\nBut c is 299,792 km/s, so:\n\n25 * 299,792 / sqrt(6) ≈ 25 * 299,792 / 2.4495 ≈ 25 * 299,792 / 2.4495\n\nFirst compute 299,792 / 2.4495 ≈ 122,358.3\n\nThen multiply by 25: 122,358.3 * 25 = 3,058,957.5 km\n\nSo, approximately 3,058,958 km, which is consistent with the previous calculation. So, approximately 3.059 million kilometers.\n\nSince the problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps expressed in terms of c and simplified, but given that they provided numerical values, they likely expect a numerical answer. Given that 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, and gamma is 5/(2√6), then:\n\ndistance = 0.2c * 50 * (5/(2√6)) = (0.2 * 50 * 5 / (2√6)) * c = (25 / √6) * c seconds\n\nBut since c is in km/s, multiplying by seconds gives km. So, (25 / √6) * c ≈ (25 / 2.449) * 299,792 ≈ 10.206 * 299,792 ≈ 3,061,800 km, which matches our prior result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic calculation, treating the time as 50 seconds in the ejecta\'s frame and directly translating that to the Galaxy\'s frame. But given that the speed is 0.2c, which is 20% the speed of light, relativistic effects are non-negligible, so they probably expect the relativistic calculation.\n\nBut just to check, if we naively assume that in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and 50 seconds pass in the ejecta\'s frame, then in the Galaxy\'s frame, the time is longer by gamma. So, time in Galaxy\'s frame is 50 * gamma ≈ 51.03 seconds. Then, distance is 0.2c * 51.03 ≈ 3.06e6 km. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 3.06 million kilometers. Depending on rounding, maybe 3.1 million, but given the exact calculation is ~3.06 million, I think 3.1 x 10^6 km is acceptable, but the precise answer is 3,061,862 km. However, maybe the problem expects an exact answer using exact gamma. Let\'s see:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(25/24) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)). Therefore, distance = 0.2c * 50 * 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = (0.2 * 50 * 5 / (2*sqrt(6))) * c = (25 / sqrt(6)) * c. Since c = 3e5 km/s, then:\n\n25 / sqrt(6) * 3e5 = (25 * 3e5) / 2.449 ≈ 75e5 / 2.449 ≈ 3,062,000 km.\n\nSo, yeah, approximately 3.06 million km. Therefore, the answer is about 3.06 million kilometers. Depending on the problem\'s expectation, maybe they want it in kilometers with scientific notation or something, but likely as a boxed number.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ejecta travels approximately \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389044, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4470, prompt_tokens=1965, total_tokens=6435, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

Given a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s (0.2c) from the ejecta's reference frame, we need to determine the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:
   - The Lorentz factor \(\gamma\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
     \]
   - The time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame (\(\Delta t\)) is:
     \[
     \Delta t = \gamma \times \Delta \tau = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = v \times \Delta t = 0.2c \times 51.03 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Converting \(0.2c\) to km/s:
     \[
     0.2c = 0.2 \times 300,000 \text{ km/s} = 60,000 \text{ km/s}
     \]
   - Therefore, the distance is:
     \[
     60,000 \text{ km/s} \times 51.03 \text{ s} \approx 3,061,800 \text{ km}
     \]

3. **Exact Calculation**:
   - Using the exact Lorentz factor and precise calculations:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \frac{25c}{\sqrt{6}} \approx 3,061,862 \text{ km}
     \]

Thus, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame is approximately \(\boxed{3.06 \times 10^6}\) kilometers.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

Alaxy's frame multiplied by the time duration in the Galaxy's frame. But the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, which would be affected by time dilation.

Wait, time dilation formula is Δt = γ Δτ, where Δτ is the proper time (time in the moving frame, here the ejecta's frame), and γ is the Lorentz factor. So, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v = 0.2c, then v²/c² = 0.04, so 1 - 0.04 = 0.96, sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.98, so γ ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0206. Therefore, Δt = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds. So, in the Galaxy's frame, approximately 51.03 seconds have passed. Therefore, the distance the ejecta travels is v * Δt = 0.2c * 51.03 s. Since c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s, 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. But wait, but hold on, maybe there's a different approach here. Because the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame, and the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is approaching at 0.2c. But the question is how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds of the ejecta's time. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to time dilation. So, the time in Galaxy frame is γ times the proper time. Then, distance is v multiplied by that. So, that gives us 0.2c * γ * 50 s.

But let me check the exact calculation. Let's compute γ when v = 0.2c.

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, Δt = γ * Δτ = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Then, distance is v * Δt = 0.2c * 51.03 s.

Since c = 3e5 km/s,

0.2 * 3e5 km/s = 6e4 km/s.

So, 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 6e4 * 5.103e1 ≈ 6 * 5.103e5 ≈ 30.618e5 km ≈ 3.0618e6 km, which is 3,061,800 km.

But wait, but maybe there's another way to think about this. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at 0.2c, so in 50 seconds, the distance covered by the Galaxy center in the ejecta's frame is 0.2c * 50 s. Then, perhaps we can relate that to the distance in the Galaxy's frame. But since the two frames are moving relative to each other, lengths are contracted. Wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so the distance it covers is v * t. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving towards it at v, so the distance is v * t'. But due to length contraction, the distance between the Galaxy center and the ejecta in the ejecta's frame is contracted by γ. Hmm. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps using Lorentz transformations. Let's denote the two events: event A is the ejecta at some position and time (say, at the moment the supernova occurs), and event B is the ejecta having moved towards the center after 50 seconds in its own frame. We need to find the spatial separation between these two events in the Galaxy's frame.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), event A is at (x', t') = (0, 0). Event B is at (x', t') = (0, 50), since the ejecta is at rest in its own frame. Now, we need to transform these coordinates to the Galaxy's frame (S), which is moving at velocity v = -0.2c relative to S' (since in S', the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c, so S is moving at +0.2c relative to S'). Wait, actually, the ejecta is moving at +0.2c in the Galaxy's frame, so the Galaxy is moving at -0.2c in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the Lorentz transformation from S' to S is:

x = γ(x' + v t')

t = γ(t' + (v x')/c² )

Since in the ejecta's frame, the two events are at (0, 0) and (0, 50). So, for event B, x' = 0, t' = 50.

Therefore, x = γ(0 + v * 50) = γ v * 50

t = γ(50 + (v * 0)/c² ) = γ * 50

Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta has moved a distance of x = γ v * 50, and the time elapsed is t = γ * 50.

But wait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v, so the distance should be x = v * t. Let's check:

x = γ v * 50

t = γ * 50

Therefore, x = v * t. So, that's consistent. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, so distance is v multiplied by time in Galaxy's frame. Since t = γ * 50, then x = v * γ * 50. So, that's the same as the Lorentz transformation result. Therefore, the distance is v * γ * t', where t' is the time in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the answer is 0.2c * γ * 50.

But let's compute that. Since 0.2c is 6e4 km/s, and γ ≈ 1.0206, so 6e4 km/s * 1.0206 * 50 s = 6e4 * 1.0206 * 50.

First compute 6e4 * 50 = 3e6.

Then multiply by 1.0206: 3e6 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km.

So, approximately 3.0618 million kilometers.

But let me check if there's any mistake here. So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. The ejecta is at rest in its own frame, so in that time, the Galaxy center moves towards it at 0.2c. Therefore, the distance the Galaxy center moves is 0.2c * 50 s = 6e4 km/s * 50 s = 3e6 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, this distance is length contracted. Wait, but the distance in the ejecta's frame is the contracted version of the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the distance between the ejecta and the center is longer. Wait, maybe that's another approach.

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving 3e6 km in 50 seconds. But in the Galaxy's frame, this distance is actually longer by a factor of γ. Because length contraction means that in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), lengths are contracted. So, the proper length (in Galaxy's frame) would be γ times the length measured in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is γ * 3e6 km ≈ 1.0206 * 3e6 ≈ 3,061,800 km. So, same result.

Therefore, both methods give the same answer, which is approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

But let me check if there's any other relativistic effect I might be missing here. For instance, is the velocity addition correct? The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, that's 0.2c. Then, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. So, there's no need for velocity transformation here because when two frames are moving relative to each other at velocity v, each sees the other moving at velocity v in the opposite direction. However, this is only exactly true in Galilean relativity. But in special relativity, the velocity transformation is different. Wait, but in the case where the object being measured is at rest in one frame, then the velocity transformation does reduce to -v. For example, if an object is at rest in the Galaxy's frame, then in the ejecta's frame, it's moving at -v. Similarly, if the ejecta is at rest in its own frame, then in the Galaxy's frame, it's moving at +v. Therefore, the speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is indeed 0.2c. Therefore, the initial calculation is correct.

Therefore, the distance is v * γ * t' where t' is 50 seconds, so 0.2c * γ * 50. Which gives us approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

But let's compute it more precisely. Let's calculate γ exactly. v = 0.2c, so:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (2 * sqrt(6))/5 ≈ (2 * 2.449)/5 ≈ 4.898/5 ≈ 0.9796

Therefore, γ ≈ 1 / 0.9796 ≈ 1.02062

So, γ ≈ 1.02062

Therefore, Δt = 1.02062 * 50 ≈ 51.031 seconds

Then, distance = 0.2c * 51.031 s

0.2c = 0.2 * 299,792 km/s ≈ 59,958.4 km/s

Then, 59,958.4 km/s * 51.031 s ≈ ?

First, multiply 59,958.4 * 50 = 2,997,920 km

Then, 59,958.4 * 1.031 ≈ 59,958.4 * 1 = 59,958.4

Plus 59,958.4 * 0.031 ≈ 59,958.4 * 0.03 = 1,798.752

Plus 59,958.4 * 0.001 = 59.9584

Total ≈ 59,958.4 + 1,798.752 + 59.9584 ≈ 61,817.11 km

Therefore, total distance ≈ 2,997,920 + 61,817.11 ≈ 3,059,737.11 km

So, approximately 3,059,737 km. Which is roughly 3.06 million kilometers.

Therefore, rounding to a reasonable number of significant figures, since the given velocity is 60,000 km/s (which is two significant figures), and the time is 50 seconds (also two significant figures), the answer should be approximately 3.1 million kilometers. But let's see. The exact value is about 3,059,737 km, which is 3.059737 x 10^6 km. So, to two significant figures, that's 3.1 x 10^6 km. But the problem states the velocity as 60,000 km/s, which is 6 x 10^4 km/s, so one significant figure? Wait, 60,000 could be two significant figures if the trailing zeros are significant, but in most cases, without a decimal, trailing zeros are ambiguous. However, in scientific notation, 60,000 km/s would be 6 x 10^4 km/s (one significant figure) or 6.0 x 10^4 km/s (two significant figures). Since the problem says "60,000 km/s", it's possible they consider it two significant figures. The time is 50 seconds, which is also ambiguous, but could be one or two. If both are two significant figures, then the answer should be 3.1 million km. If the velocity is one and the time is one, then 3 x 10^6 km. But given that 60,000 is written as two, maybe they expect two sig figs.

But let me check the exact calculation again. If we use 60,000 km/s exactly (so taking 60,000 as precise), and 50 seconds as precise, then the exact answer would be:

60,000 km/s * 50 s * γ

But γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

So, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000

3,000,000 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

So, approximately 3,061,862 km. Which is 3.061862 x 10^6 km.

So, approximately 3.06 million kilometers. Depending on the desired precision, this could be 3.06 million, 3.1 million, or 3.06 x 10^6 km.

But the problem might expect an exact answer using exact fractions. Let's see:

Since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(24/25) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) ≈ 5 / 4.89898 ≈ 1.0206

But perhaps we can keep it symbolic:

γ = 5 / (2*sqrt(6))

So, distance = v * γ * t' = 0.2c * (5 / (2*sqrt(6))) * t'

But 0.2c = c/5, so:

distance = (c/5) * (5 / (2*sqrt(6))) * t' = c / (2*sqrt(6)) * t'

Then, plugging in t' = 50 seconds:

distance = (c * 50) / (2*sqrt(6)) = (50 c) / (2*sqrt(6)) = (25 c) / sqrt(6)

But c is 299,792 km/s, so:

25 * 299,792 / sqrt(6) ≈ 25 * 299,792 / 2.4495 ≈ 25 * 299,792 / 2.4495

First compute 299,792 / 2.4495 ≈ 122,358.3

Then multiply by 25: 122,358.3 * 25 = 3,058,957.5 km

So, approximately 3,058,958 km, which is consistent with the previous calculation. So, approximately 3.059 million kilometers.

Since the problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps expressed in terms of c and simplified, but given that they provided numerical values, they likely expect a numerical answer. Given that 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, and gamma is 5/(2√6), then:

distance = 0.2c * 50 * (5/(2√6)) = (0.2 * 50 * 5 / (2√6)) * c = (25 / √6) * c seconds

But since c is in km/s, multiplying by seconds gives km. So, (25 / √6) * c ≈ (25 / 2.449) * 299,792 ≈ 10.206 * 299,792 ≈ 3,061,800 km, which matches our prior result.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a non-relativistic calculation, treating the time as 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame and directly translating that to the Galaxy's frame. But given that the speed is 0.2c, which is 20% the speed of light, relativistic effects are non-negligible, so they probably expect the relativistic calculation.

But just to check, if we naively assume that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, then in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer by gamma. So, time in Galaxy's frame is 50 * gamma ≈ 51.03 seconds. Then, distance is 0.2c * 51.03 ≈ 3.06e6 km. So, same result.

Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3.06 million kilometers. Depending on rounding, maybe 3.1 million, but given the exact calculation is ~3.06 million, I think 3.1 x 10^6 km is acceptable, but the precise answer is 3,061,862 km. However, maybe the problem expects an exact answer using exact gamma. Let's see:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(25/24) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)). Therefore, distance = 0.2c * 50 * 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) = (0.2 * 50 * 5 / (2*sqrt(6))) * c = (25 / sqrt(6)) * c. Since c = 3e5 km/s, then:

25 / sqrt(6) * 3e5 = (25 * 3e5) / 2.449 ≈ 75e5 / 2.449 ≈ 3,062,000 km.

So, yeah, approximately 3.06 million km. Therefore, the answer is about 3.06 million kilometers. Depending on the problem's expectation, maybe they want it in kilometers with scientific notation or something, but likely as a boxed number.

**Final Answer**
The ejecta travels approximately \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, we use special relativity principles. 

1. **Velocity and Time Dilation**:  
   - The ejecta moves at \( v = 0.2c \) (60,000 km/s) relative to the Galaxy.  
   - Time in the Galaxy frame (\( \Delta t \)) is related to the ejecta's proper time (\( \Delta t' = 50 \, \text{s} \)) by time dilation:  
     \[
     \Delta t = \gamma \Delta t'
     \]
     where the Lorentz factor \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).  
     Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):  
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} \approx 1.0206
     \]
     Thus, \( \Delta t \approx 1.0206 \times 50 \, \text{s} \approx 51.03 \, \text{s} \).

2. **Distance Calculation**:  
   - In the Galaxy frame, the distance traveled is:  
     \[
     d = v \times \Delta t = 0.2c \times 51.03 \, \text{s}
     \]
     Converting \( 0.2c \) to km/s: \( 0.2 \times 300,000 \, \text{km/s} = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \).  
     Therefore:  
     \[
     d = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
     \]

**Answer**:  
The ejecta travels approximately **3.06 million kilometers** in the Galaxy's reference frame.  
\(\boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \, \text{km}}\)

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The time dilation formula is:
Δt = γΔt'

Where γ (gamma) is the Lorentz factor:
γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

Given that v = 0.2c, let's compute γ:
v²/c² = (0.2c)² / c² = 0.04
1 - 0.04 = 0.96
sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798
γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206

So Δt (Galaxy frame time) = 1.0206 × 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds

Then, the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame would be:
d = v × Δt = 0.2c × 51.03 s

But wait, c is 3 × 10^8 m/s, so 0.2c = 6 × 10^7 m/s

Therefore, d = 6 × 10^7 m/s × 51.03 s ≈ 3.0618 × 10^9 meters

Converting to kilometers: 3.0618 × 10^6 km, which is approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

But wait, let's check if this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this. Since the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy frame, and we need to find how far it travels in the Galaxy frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta frame. But time in the ejecta frame is proper time because the events (start and end of the journey) occur at the same position in the ejecta's frame. Therefore, the proper time Δt' = 50 s is related to the coordinate time in the Galaxy frame by time dilation: Δt = γΔt'

So the calculation above seems correct. Then the distance would be v × γΔt' = 0.2c × γ × 50.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use length contraction. But since the ejecta is moving, the distance it covers in the Galaxy frame would be vΔt, where Δt is the time in the Galaxy frame. However, the time experienced by the ejecta is Δt' = 50 s. So yes, Δt = γΔt', then d = vγΔt'.

Alternatively, maybe using Lorentz transformation. Let me check.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galactic center is approaching at 0.2c. Let's consider two events: event 1 is the ejecta at t1' = 0, and event 2 is the ejecta after 50 seconds, t2' = 50 s. We need to find the distance between these two events in the Galaxy frame (S). But in S', the ejecta is stationary, so the two events are separated by 50 seconds in time and 0 in space (since the ejecta doesn't move in its own frame). Using Lorentz transformations:

In S, the coordinates are:

x = γ(x' + vt')

t = γ(t' + (v x')/c²)

Since x' = 0 (both events occur at the origin of S'), then:

x = γ(v t')

t = γ t'

Therefore, the distance traveled in S is x = γ v t'

Which gives the same result as before: x = 1.0206 * 0.2c * 50 s

So that's 1.0206 * 0.2 * 3e8 m/s * 50 s

Calculating:

0.2 * 3e8 = 6e7 m/s

6e7 * 50 = 3e9 m

Multiply by γ (≈1.0206):

3e9 * 1.0206 ≈ 3.0618e9 m, which is 3.0618e6 km.

Wait, but the problem states that the ejecta is moving toward the Galactic center. So in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c, and the time elapsed in the Galaxy frame is longer by gamma. Therefore, the distance should be 0.2c * gamma * 50 seconds.

But let me check the numbers again. 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But with the time dilation factor, it's 3,000,000 km * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km.

So the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. But to be precise, let's compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.2c, so v = 60,000 km/s = 6e7 m/s.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9797958976

Therefore, gamma ≈ 1 / 0.9797958976 ≈ 1.020620726

So gamma ≈ 1.020620726

Then, time in Galaxy frame: 50 s * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds

Distance: 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

Rounded to, say, three significant figures: 3.06e6 km, which is 3,060,000 km.

But let me check if the problem expects a more precise answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach where length contraction is considered.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the Galactic center is moving towards it at 0.2c. So in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the Galactic center is contracted.

Another way to think about it is that the proper time (Δt') experienced by the ejecta is 50 seconds. The distance traveled in the Galaxy frame would be the velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy frame (Δt), which is gamma times Δt'. Thus, d = v * gamma * Δt'

So, using the exact gamma value:

d = 0.2c * (1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04)) * 50

Let me compute this step by step:

0.2c = 60,000 km/s

sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9797958976

gamma ≈ 1.020620726

So d = 60,000 km/s * 1.020620726 * 50 s

First multiply 60,000 by 50: 3,000,000 km

Then multiply by 1.020620726: 3,061,862.178 km

So approximately 3.06 million kilometers. The problem might expect the answer in kilometers with three significant figures, so 3.06 × 10^6 km.

Alternatively, if we use exact fractions:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(24/25) = 5 / (2*sqrt(6)) ≈ 5/(2*2.449489743) ≈ 5/4.898979486 ≈ 1.020620726

But perhaps the problem expects an exact answer. Alternatively, maybe the velocity addition formula isn't necessary here because the problem states that both frames are inertial and moving at 0.2c relative to each other. Then time dilation is straightforward.

Therefore, the answer is 60,000 km/s * gamma * 50 s. As computed, approximately 3.06 million kilometers. So I think that's the correct approach.

But since in the ejecta\'s frame, the events are occurring at the same place (since the ejecta is stationary), x\' = 0. Therefore, t = γ t\'. So yes, t = γ τ. Therefore, the time in the Galaxy\'s frame is γ times the proper time.\n\nBut wait, proper time is the time measured in the frame where both events (start and end of the 50 seconds) occur at the same place. Since the ejecta is stationary in its own frame, the two events (start of the 50 seconds and end of the 50 seconds) are at the same location in space. Therefore, the proper time is indeed τ = 50 seconds, and the time in the Galaxy\'s frame is t = γ τ.\n\nTherefore, t = γ * 50. Then, the distance traveled in the Galaxy\'s frame is v * t = 0.2c * γ * 50.\n\nBut let\'s compute that. Given v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s, gamma is approximately 1.0206.

But since the ejecta was at some position when t\'=0, which would correspond to t=0 in the Galaxy frame. So, the distance the ejecta travels is x = γ v t\'.\n\nBut if we compute that, it\'s γ v t\' = 1.0206 * 60,000 km/s * 50 s.\n\nWhich is 1.0206 * 60,000 * 50.\n\nLet\'s compute:\n\n60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.\n\nThen 3,000,000 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut wait, but in the Galaxy frame, the time elapsed is 51.03 s, so 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. So same result.\n\nTherefore, either way, the answer is approximately 3,061,800 km. But let\'s check if that\'s the correct approach.\n\nBut here\'s a thought: in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c towards it, so in 50 seconds, the Galaxy center would move a distance of 0.2c * 50 s = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c, but the time is longer. So, the distance should be longer by gamma, hence 3,000,000 km * gamma ≈ 3,061,800 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. If the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy frame, then in the Galaxy\'s frame, the time experienced by the ejecta is 50 seconds, so we need to calculate the proper time. Wait, no. The proper time is the time measured in the ejecta\'s frame, which is 50 seconds. So, the time in the Galaxy\'s frame is longer. Therefore, the distance is v * t, where t = gamma * tau, hence the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the answer is simply 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km, but considering that the ejecta\'s time is 50 seconds, but since in the Galaxy\'s frame, the time is longer, so the distance is longer. But according to the calculation, it\'s approximately 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut maybe I should check the exact value. Let\'s compute gamma precisely.\n\nβ = 0.2\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.89898 / 5 ≈ 0.9798\n\nTherefore, γ ≈ 1.0206\n\nTherefore, t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 seconds.\n\nThen, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the Lorentz contraction? Wait, no. Because the distance in one frame is related via length contraction, but here we are dealing with the distance traveled, which is a matter of velocity multiplied by time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the velocity addition formula. Wait, but the velocity is given as 0.2c in both frames. Wait, but in reality, velocities are opposite. If the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c towards the ejecta in the ejecta\'s frame, then the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center in the Galaxy\'s frame. So, the velocity is 0.2c in both cases, but in opposite directions. So, the velocity is 0.2c in the Galaxy\'s frame.\n\nTherefore, the distance is velocity multiplied by time. But the time in the Galaxy\'s frame is gamma multiplied by the proper time. Therefore, the answer is 0.2c * gamma * 50 seconds.\n\nTherefore, 0.2 * 300,000 km/s * 1.0206 * 50 s.\n\nWait, 0.2 * 300,000 km/s is 60,000 km/s. So, 60,000 km/s * 1.0206 * 50 s. So, same as before: 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50.\n\nWait, but 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000, then 3,000,000 * 1.0206 = 3,061,800 km.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but since both frames are inertial, and the velocity is given as 0.2c in each frame, but the problem states that in the ejecta\'s frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c. Then, in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. So, the velocity is reciprocal.\n\nBut in reality, according to special relativity, if frame S\' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then an object at rest in S\' is moving at velocity v in S. So, if the ejecta is at rest in S\', then S\' is moving at v = 0.2c relative to S (Galaxy frame). Therefore, the ejecta\'s velocity in the Galaxy frame is 0.2c. Therefore, the distance is 0.2c * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy frame. The time in the Galaxy frame is gamma multiplied by the proper time (50 seconds). Therefore, the answer is 0.2c * gamma * 50.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3,061,800 km. But let\'s check whether this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the answer is 3,000,000 km, but that would ignore relativistic effects. However, since the speed is 0.2c, gamma is about 1.0206, so the difference is about 2%, which is non-negligible. So, 3,061,800 km is the correct answer. But let\'s check with exact calculation.\n\nCompute gamma exactly:\n\nγ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(24/25)) = 5 / sqrt(24) ≈ 5 / 4.89898 ≈ 1.020620726\n\nSo, 1.020620726 * 50 = 51.0310363 seconds.\n\nThen, 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 * 51.0310363 = 3,061,862.18 km.\n\nTherefore, approximately 3,061,862 km.\n\nBut the problem gives the velocity as 60,000 km/s, which is exactly 0.2c (since 0.2 * 300,000 = 60,000). So, exact calculation would be:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (2 * sqrt(0.24)).\n\nBut perhaps it\'s better to use exact fractions. Let\'s see:\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5 = (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ 2*2.44949 /5 ≈ 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.9798.\n\nThus, gamma is 5/(2*sqrt(6)).\n\nTherefore, gamma = 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)) ≈ 5 / 4.89898 ≈ 1.0206.\n\nBut perhaps we can compute the exact value:\n\ngamma = 1.020620726\n\nThus, t = 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds.\n\nThen, 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.18 km.\n\nSo, approximately 3.062 million kilometers.\n\nBut the problem states "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" So, in the Galaxy\'s frame, the time is longer, so the ejecta travels further.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to use the Lorentz transformation for the coordinates.\n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), the ejecta is at rest, so after 50 seconds, the coordinates are (t\' = 50 s, x\' = 0). Then, to find the coordinates in the Galaxy\'s frame (S), we use:\n\nx = gamma (x\' + v t\')\n\nt = gamma (t\' + (v x\') / c² )\n\nSince x\' = 0, this simplifies to:\n\nx = gamma v t\'\n\nt = gamma t\'\n\nTherefore, x = gamma v t\'\n\nSo, x = gamma * v * t\' = (1.0206) * (60,000 km/s) * 50 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.\n\nWhich matches our previous result.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s check in the Galaxy\'s frame. If the ejecta is moving at 0.2c for t = gamma * 50 seconds, then the distance is 0.2c * t = 0.2c * gamma * 50.\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. But the problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps in terms of gamma, but given that the velocity is 0.2c, and the time is 50 seconds, the exact value would be (0.2c) * (gamma) * 50.\n\nBut since the problem gives numerical values, we need to compute the numerical answer. Let\'s check the exact calculation.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nSo, 1.020620726 * 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 1.020620726 * 3,000,000 km ≈ 3,061,862.178 km.\n\nRounded to, say, three significant figures, that\'s approximately 3.06 x 10^6 km, or 3,060,000 km. But given that 60,000 km/s and 50 seconds are both given as exact values (assuming they are precise), the answer should be 3,061,862 km. However, the problem might expect an answer in more rounded terms. Let\'s see:\n\nIf gamma is approximately 1.0206, then multiplying 3,000,000 km by 1.0206 gives 3,061,800 km. So, 3.0618 x 10^6 km.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is better expressed as 3.06e6 km. But given the problem\'s use of 60,000 km/s (two significant figures?), but 50 seconds is exact? Wait, 60,000 km/s is written as sixty thousand km/s, which is 6 x 10^4, so perhaps two significant figures. 50 seconds is also two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be given with two significant figures.\n\nSo, 3.06 x 10^6 km would be three sig figs. But if gamma is 1.0206, which is approximately 1.02 (two sig figs), then 1.02 * 3,000,000 = 3,060,000 km. So, 3.1 x 10^6 km. But wait, 1.02 is three sig figs. Wait, perhaps the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s, which is 6.0 x 10^4 km/s, two sig figs. Then, 50 seconds is two sig figs. Then, the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 million km. But let\'s compute:\n\ngamma using two sig figs: 1.02\n\nt = 50 s * 1.02 = 51 s\n\ndistance = 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km, which is 3.1 x 10^6 km with two sig figs.\n\nBut the precise calculation gives approximately 3,061,862 km, which is 3.06 million km. If the question expects three sig figs, then 3.06 million km. If two, 3.1 million. But the problem states "sixty thousand km/s", which is 60,000 km/s. If that\'s considered two sig figs (with the trailing zeros not being significant), then 6.0 x 10^4 km/s, which is two sig figs. 50 seconds is also two sig figs. So, answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km, i.e., 3,100,000 km.\n\nBut wait, 60,000 km/s could be ambiguous in terms of sig figs. If written as 60,000, without a decimal, it could be 2, 3, 4, or 5 sig figs depending on context. But in the problem statement, it\'s written as "60 000 km/s" with a space as thousand separator, which is common in some countries. So, maybe it\'s considered 5 significant figures? But "sixty thousand" in words is two sig figs. So, likely two sig figs. Then, 50 seconds is two sig figs. Therefore, the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km.\n\nBut wait, in the calculation, gamma is 1.0206, which if we take two sig figs for beta (0.20), then gamma would be 1.0206, which is approximately 1.02 (three sig figs). But since beta is two sig figs (0.20), then gamma would be two sig figs: 1.02. Then, multiplying 1.02 (two sig figs) by 50 s (two sig figs) gives 51 s (two sig figs). Then, 60,000 km/s (two sig figs) times 51 s (two sig figs) is 3,060,000 km, which is 3.1 x 10^6 km (two sig figs).\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3.1 million kilometers. But in the exact calculation, it\'s 3,061,862 km, which is 3.06 million. However, given significant figures, two sig figs would be 3.1 million km. But the problem might not care about sig figs and just want the precise calculation. Let\'s check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says "sixty thousand km/s" which is 60,000 km/s. If that\'s an exact value (maybe in the problem\'s context, it\'s precise), and 50 seconds is exact, then we can compute gamma with more precision and present the answer as 3,060,000 or 3,061,862 km. But since the problem is likely expecting a precise answer, and given that in the problem statement, we can use more precise gamma.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the distance in the Galaxy frame is simply 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km, ignoring relativity. But since the velocity is 0.2c, time dilation is a factor. Therefore, the correct answer must consider gamma. Therefore, 3,061,862 km. But the problem might expect rounding to, say, three significant figures, which is 3.06 million km. Let\'s check the numerical value of gamma again.\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nSo, multiplying 60,000 km/s * 50 s * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km.\n\nBut perhaps the problem wants the answer in kilometers without commas, so 3061862 km. But that\'s seven digits, which is overkill. Alternatively, in scientific notation: 3.06 x 10^6 km.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives both numbers as exact (60,000 km/s and 50 s), perhaps the answer is 3,000,000 * gamma = 3,000,000 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862 km. Therefore, 3,061,862 km.\n\nBut maybe we can write it as 3.06 × 10^6 km. However, the problem might expect an exact answer using exact fractions. Let\'s see:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (1/5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(24/25) = 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)).\n\nThus, x = (5 / (2 * sqrt(6))) * 60,000 * 50.\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.\n\nThen, 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)) * 3,000,000.\n\nCompute 5/(2√6):\n\n5/(2*2.449489743) ≈ 5/4.898979 ≈ 1.020620726\n\nThus, same result. Therefore, the exact answer is (5 / (2 * sqrt(6))) * 3,000,000 km.\n\nBut unless the problem wants the answer in terms of sqrt(6), which is unlikely, the decimal form is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3,061,862 km, which can be rounded to 3.06 x 10^6 km. Given that the problem probably expects a numerical answer, this would be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, check with another approach. Suppose we use spacetime intervals. The spacetime interval between the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) is invariant.\n\nIn the ejecta\'s frame (S\'), the interval is:\n\nΔs² = (c Δt\')² - (Δx\')² = (c * 50)^2 - 0 = (50c)^2.\n\nIn the Galaxy\'s frame (S), the interval is:\n\nΔs² = (c Δt)^2 - (Δx)^2.\n\nSince intervals are equal:\n\n(c * 50)^2 = (c t)^2 - x²\n\nBut x = v t, since the ejecta is moving at velocity v in the Galaxy\'s frame.\n\nThus,\n\n(c * 50)^2 = (c t)^2 - (v t)^2\n\nDivide both sides by c²:\n\n50² = t² - (v²/c²) t² = t² (1 - v²/c²)\n\nTherefore,\n\nt² = 50² / (1 - v²/c²)\n\nThus,\n\nt = 50 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = gamma * 50\n\nWhich is the same result as before. Then, x = v t = v gamma * 50 = 0.2c * gamma * 50.\n\nTherefore, the same answer. So, this confirms the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 3,061,862 km. Depending on the problem\'s requirement for significant figures, but since the given data is 60,000 km/s (possibly two sig figs) and 50 s (two sig figs), the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km, which is 3,100,000 km. However, given that the exact calculation gives ~3,061,862 km, which is 3.06 million, maybe three sig figs.\n\nBut "sixty thousand" is 6.0 x 10^4, which is two sig figs. 50 seconds is two sig figs. So, the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km.\n\nBut this is a physics problem, and in physics, trailing zeros without a decimal are ambiguous. However, written as "sixty thousand", it\'s two sig figs. Therefore, the answer is 3.1 million km. But let\'s check with the initial velocity.\n\nWait, 60,000 km/s is 6.0 x 10^4 km/s, which is two sig figs. 50 seconds is 5.0 x 10^1 s, two sig figs. So, multiplying 6.0 x 10^4 km/s * 5.0 x 10^1 s = 3.0 x 10^6 km, but considering gamma of 1.02 (two sig figs), 3.0 x 1.02 = 3.06 x 10^6 km, which is 3.1 x 10^6 km when rounded to two sig figs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.1 million kilometers. But the exact calculation is approximately 3.06 million. However, given the problem\'s use of "sixty thousand" and "50", which are two sig figs each, the answer should be two sig figs. Hence, 3.1 x 10^6 km.\n\nBut I need to verify once more. If the velocity is 0.2c, then gamma is 1.0206, which is approximately 1.02. Therefore, gamma is approximately two sig figs (1.02). So, 50 s * 1.02 = 51 s. Then, 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km, which is 3.1 x 10^6 km when rounded to two sig figs.\n\nAlternatively, 3,060,000 km is three sig figs. If the problem allows three sig figs, then 3.06 x 10^6 km. But given the input has two sig figs, the answer should be two. Therefore, 3.1 million km.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn\'t care about sig figs and wants the precise answer, which is approximately 3,061,862 km. However, in the absence of specific instructions, it\'s safer to go with significant figures. But let\'s check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n"A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it. What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"\n\nNo mention of significant figures. It\'s a numerical problem expecting an exact answer. Given that, perhaps the answer is 3,061,862 km, but to check, maybe it\'s intended to use a simpler approach. Wait, but the problem says "Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored." So, it\'s purely a special relativity problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the velocity and the time in the ejecta\'s frame, but using the length contraction formula. Wait, but the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame isn\'t a length contraction; it\'s a distance over time. So, that approach isn\'t applicable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a simple velocity * time, but considering time dilation. Which is what we did. So, the answer is gamma * v * t\'. So, 1.0206 * 60,000 * 50 ≈ 3,061,862 km.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 3,000,000 km, but that would neglect relativistic effects, which are present here. Since the velocity is 0.2c, gamma is about 1.02, so there\'s a 2% difference. Therefore, the answer must account for that.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is approximately 3,061,862 km, which is about 3.06 million kilometers. Given that, and if the problem expects a box around it, I would present it as \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km}} or \\boxed{3060000 \\text{ km}}.\n\nHowever, checking once more: if we use exact numbers:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726\n\nt = gamma * 50 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds\n\ndistance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.178 km\n\nRounded to the nearest kilometer, that\'s 3,061,862 km. But likely, the problem expects the answer in a more compact form. If we convert this to scientific notation with three significant figures, it\'s 3.06 x 10^6 km. If two sig figs, 3.1 x 10^6 km.\n\nGiven that the problem\'s velocity is 60,000 km/s (which could be two or five sig figs) and 50 seconds (two sig figs), it\'s safer to go with two sig figs. However, in many contexts, 60,000 written with a space as a thousand separator (as in 60 000 km/s) might be considered five sig figs. For example, in some European notations, spaces are used as thousand separators, so 60 000 is 60,000 with five significant figures. However, since it\'s written in words as "sixty thousand", which is two sig figs. This is ambiguous.\n\nIf it\'s five sig figs, then gamma would be 1.02062, and the answer would be 3,061,862 km, which is six sig figs. But since the time is 50 seconds (two sig figs), the answer should be two sig figs. So, regardless of the velocity\'s sig figs, the time\'s sig figs limit the answer to two. Hence, 3.1 x 10^6 km.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects us to ignore relativistic effects. Let me check with non-relativistic calculation.\n\nIf we ignore relativity, then in the Galaxy\'s frame, the ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds (ejecta\'s time). But since the ejecta\'s time is proper time, and in non-relativistic physics, time is absolute. Therefore, the distance would be 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But the problem states that both frames are inertial and to consider special relativity ("Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference."), so we cannot ignore relativity. Therefore, the answer must account for time dilation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. Given that, I think the problem expects this answer. So, writing it as \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km}} or \\boxed{3060000 \\text{ km}}.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects an exact fraction, but that\'s unlikely. So, based on the calculations, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ejecta travels approximately \\boxed{3.06 \\times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745389366, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=7156, prompt_tokens=897, total_tokens=8053, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

Given a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s (0.2c) in the Galaxy's reference frame, we need to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. 

1. **Relativistic Time Dilation**:
   - The time experienced in the ejecta's frame (proper time) is \( \tau = 50 \) seconds.
   - The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
     \]
   - The time in the Galaxy's frame is dilated by \( \gamma \):
     \[
     t = \gamma \tau = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is the product of the velocity (60,000 km/s) and the dilated time:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = v \times t = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \times 51.03 \, \text{s} \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
     \]

3. **Significant Figures**:
   - Considering the problem's significant figures (60,000 km/s and 50 seconds as two significant figures), the final answer is rounded to three significant figures:
     \[
     \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}}
     \]

The time experienced in the ejecta's frame is the proper time, τ = 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is related by time dilation:

t = γ(τ + (v x') / c²)

But since in the ejecta's frame, the event is at rest (x' = 0), so t = γ τ

Wait, actually, if the ejecta's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the Galaxy's frame, then the time dilation formula would be:

t = γ (τ + (v x') / c² )

But in the ejecta's frame, the position x' of the ejecta is always zero (since it's at rest in its own frame). Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame is γ τ.

Therefore, the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame is longer by a factor of gamma. So t = γ * τ.

Gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), with β = 0.2. So β² = 0.04, 1 - β² = 0.96, sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798, so γ ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

Therefore, t ≈ 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, but let's check if that's correct. If the ejecta's frame is moving at v = 0.2c relative to the Galaxy's frame, then the time dilation formula is t = γ (t' + (v x') / c² ). But since in the ejecta's frame, the events are occurring at the same place (since the ejecta is stationary), x' = 0. Therefore, t = γ t'. So yes, t = γ τ. Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame is γ times the proper time.

But wait, proper time is the time measured in the frame where both events (start and end of the 50 seconds) occur at the same place. Since the ejecta is stationary in its own frame, the two events (start of the 50 seconds and end of the 50 seconds) are at the same location in space. Therefore, the proper time is indeed τ = 50 seconds, and the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = γ τ.

Therefore, t = γ * 50. Then, the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is v * t = 0.2c * γ * 50.

But let's compute that. Given v = 0.2c = 60,000 km/s, gamma is approximately 1.0206. So 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km. But wait, let me check the actual calculation.

First, compute gamma:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, time in Galaxy frame: t = 50 s * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 s.

Then, distance in Galaxy frame: d = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.

But that's if we use the non-relativistic calculation, but wait, is there another way?

Alternatively, perhaps we need to use the Lorentz transformation to find the coordinates in the Galaxy frame. Let me think.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the event is at rest, so the coordinates are (x' = 0, t' = 50 s). To find the coordinates in the Galaxy frame (S), we use the Lorentz transformation:

x = γ(x' + v t')

t = γ(t' + (v x') / c² )

Since x' = 0, this simplifies to:

x = γ v t'

t = γ t'

Therefore, the position in the Galaxy frame is x = γ v t', and the time is t = γ t'.

Therefore, the distance traveled is x = γ v t'.

But since the ejecta is moving at velocity v in the Galaxy frame, the distance should be v t. But here, t = γ t', so x = v γ t' = γ v t'.

But in this case, x is the position of the ejecta in the Galaxy frame. But since the ejecta was at some position when t'=0, which would correspond to t=0 in the Galaxy frame. So, the distance the ejecta travels is x = γ v t'.

But if we compute that, it's γ v t' = 1.0206 * 60,000 km/s * 50 s.

Which is 1.0206 * 60,000 * 50.

Let's compute:

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km.

Then 3,000,000 * 1.0206 ≈ 3,061,800 km.

But wait, but in the Galaxy frame, the time elapsed is 51.03 s, so 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km. So same result.

Therefore, either way, the answer is approximately 3,061,800 km. But let's check if that's the correct approach.

But here's a thought: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c towards it, so in 50 seconds, the Galaxy center would move a distance of 0.2c * 50 s = 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 0.2c, but the time is longer. So, the distance should be longer by gamma, hence 3,000,000 km * gamma ≈ 3,061,800 km.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. If the ejecta is moving at 0.2c in the Galaxy frame, then in the Galaxy's frame, the time experienced by the ejecta is 50 seconds, so we need to calculate the proper time. Wait, no. The proper time is the time measured in the ejecta's frame, which is 50 seconds. So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer. Therefore, the distance is v * t, where t = gamma * tau, hence the result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the answer is simply 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km, but considering that the ejecta's time is 50 seconds, but since in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, so the distance is longer. But according to the calculation, it's approximately 3,061,800 km.

But maybe I should check the exact value. Let's compute gamma precisely.

β = 0.2

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96)

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.89898 / 5 ≈ 0.9798

Therefore, γ ≈ 1.0206

Therefore, t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Then, 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.03 = 3,061,800 km.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the Lorentz contraction? Wait, no. Because the distance in one frame is related via length contraction, but here we are dealing with the distance traveled, which is a matter of velocity multiplied by time.

Alternatively, perhaps using the velocity addition formula. Wait, but the velocity is given as 0.2c in both frames. Wait, but in reality, velocities are opposite. If the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c towards the ejecta in the ejecta's frame, then the ejecta is moving at 0.2c towards the center in the Galaxy's frame. So, the velocity is 0.2c in both cases, but in opposite directions. So, the velocity is 0.2c in the Galaxy's frame.

Therefore, the distance is velocity multiplied by time. But the time in the Galaxy's frame is gamma multiplied by the proper time. Therefore, the answer is 0.2c * gamma * 50 seconds.

Therefore, 0.2 * 300,000 km/s * 1.0206 * 50 s.

Wait, 0.2 * 300,000 km/s is 60,000 km/s. So, 60,000 km/s * 1.0206 * 50 s. So, same as before: 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50.

Wait, but 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000, then 3,000,000 * 1.0206 = 3,061,800 km.

But perhaps the problem is expecting to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but since both frames are inertial, and the velocity is given as 0.2c in each frame, but the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is moving at 0.2c. Then, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 0.2c. So, the velocity is reciprocal.

But in reality, according to special relativity, if frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then an object at rest in S' is moving at velocity v in S. So, if the ejecta is at rest in S', then S' is moving at v = 0.2c relative to S (Galaxy frame). Therefore, the ejecta's velocity in the Galaxy frame is 0.2c. Therefore, the distance is 0.2c * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy frame. The time in the Galaxy frame is gamma multiplied by the proper time (50 seconds). Therefore, the answer is 0.2c * gamma * 50.

Therefore, the answer is 3,061,800 km. But let's check whether this is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the answer is 3,000,000 km, but that would ignore relativistic effects. However, since the speed is 0.2c, gamma is about 1.0206, so the difference is about 2%, which is non-negligible. So, 3,061,800 km is the correct answer. But let's check with exact calculation.

Compute gamma exactly:

γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (sqrt(24/25)) = 5 / sqrt(24) ≈ 5 / 4.89898 ≈ 1.020620726

So, 1.020620726 * 50 = 51.0310363 seconds.

Then, 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s = 60,000 * 51.0310363 = 3,061,862.18 km.

Therefore, approximately 3,061,862 km.

But the problem gives the velocity as 60,000 km/s, which is exactly 0.2c (since 0.2 * 300,000 = 60,000). So, exact calculation would be:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) = 1 / (2 * sqrt(0.24)).

But perhaps it's better to use exact fractions. Let's see:

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5 = (2*sqrt(6))/5 ≈ 2*2.44949 /5 ≈ 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.9798.

Thus, gamma is 5/(2*sqrt(6)).

Therefore, gamma = 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)) ≈ 5 / 4.89898 ≈ 1.0206.

But perhaps we can compute the exact value:

gamma = 1.020620726

Thus, t = 50 * 1.020620726 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds.

Then, 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.18 km.

So, approximately 3.062 million kilometers.

But the problem states "What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?" So, in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, so the ejecta travels further.

But perhaps another approach is to use the Lorentz transformation for the coordinates.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the ejecta is at rest, so after 50 seconds, the coordinates are (t' = 50 s, x' = 0). Then, to find the coordinates in the Galaxy's frame (S), we use:

x = gamma (x' + v t')

t = gamma (t' + (v x') / c² )

Since x' = 0, this simplifies to:

x = gamma v t'

t = gamma t'

Therefore, x = gamma v t'

So, x = gamma * v * t' = (1.0206) * (60,000 km/s) * 50 s ≈ 3,061,800 km.

Which matches our previous result.

Alternatively, let's check in the Galaxy's frame. If the ejecta is moving at 0.2c for t = gamma * 50 seconds, then the distance is 0.2c * t = 0.2c * gamma * 50.

Same result.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. But the problem might expect an exact answer, perhaps in terms of gamma, but given that the velocity is 0.2c, and the time is 50 seconds, the exact value would be (0.2c) * (gamma) * 50.

But since the problem gives numerical values, we need to compute the numerical answer. Let's check the exact calculation.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

So, 1.020620726 * 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 1.020620726 * 3,000,000 km ≈ 3,061,862.178 km.

Rounded to, say, three significant figures, that's approximately 3.06 x 10^6 km, or 3,060,000 km. But given that 60,000 km/s and 50 seconds are both given as exact values (assuming they are precise), the answer should be 3,061,862 km. However, the problem might expect an answer in more rounded terms. Let's see:

If gamma is approximately 1.0206, then multiplying 3,000,000 km by 1.0206 gives 3,061,800 km. So, 3.0618 x 10^6 km.

But perhaps the answer is better expressed as 3.06e6 km. But given the problem's use of 60,000 km/s (two significant figures?), but 50 seconds is exact? Wait, 60,000 km/s is written as sixty thousand km/s, which is 6 x 10^4, so perhaps two significant figures. 50 seconds is also two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be given with two significant figures.

So, 3.06 x 10^6 km would be three sig figs. But if gamma is 1.0206, which is approximately 1.02 (two sig figs), then 1.02 * 3,000,000 = 3,060,000 km. So, 3.1 x 10^6 km. But wait, 1.02 is three sig figs. Wait, perhaps the velocity is given as 60,000 km/s, which is 6.0 x 10^4 km/s, two sig figs. Then, 50 seconds is two sig figs. Then, the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 million km. But let's compute:

gamma using two sig figs: 1.02

t = 50 s * 1.02 = 51 s

distance = 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km, which is 3.1 x 10^6 km with two sig figs.

But the precise calculation gives approximately 3,061,862 km, which is 3.06 million km. If the question expects three sig figs, then 3.06 million km. If two, 3.1 million. But the problem states "sixty thousand km/s", which is 60,000 km/s. If that's considered two sig figs (with the trailing zeros not being significant), then 6.0 x 10^4 km/s, which is two sig figs. 50 seconds is also two sig figs. So, answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km, i.e., 3,100,000 km.

But wait, 60,000 km/s could be ambiguous in terms of sig figs. If written as 60,000, without a decimal, it could be 2, 3, 4, or 5 sig figs depending on context. But in the problem statement, it's written as "60 000 km/s" with a space as thousand separator, which is common in some countries. So, maybe it's considered 5 significant figures? But "sixty thousand" in words is two sig figs. So, likely two sig figs. Then, 50 seconds is two sig figs. Therefore, the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km.

But wait, in the calculation, gamma is 1.0206, which if we take two sig figs for beta (0.20), then gamma would be 1.0206, which is approximately 1.02 (three sig figs). But since beta is two sig figs (0.20), then gamma would be two sig figs: 1.02. Then, multiplying 1.02 (two sig figs) by 50 s (two sig figs) gives 51 s (two sig figs). Then, 60,000 km/s (two sig figs) times 51 s (two sig figs) is 3,060,000 km, which is 3.1 x 10^6 km (two sig figs).

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3.1 million kilometers. But in the exact calculation, it's 3,061,862 km, which is 3.06 million. However, given significant figures, two sig figs would be 3.1 million km. But the problem might not care about sig figs and just want the precise calculation. Let's check the problem statement again.

The problem says "sixty thousand km/s" which is 60,000 km/s. If that's an exact value (maybe in the problem's context, it's precise), and 50 seconds is exact, then we can compute gamma with more precision and present the answer as 3,060,000 or 3,061,862 km. But since the problem is likely expecting a precise answer, and given that in the problem statement, we can use more precise gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the distance in the Galaxy frame is simply 60,000 km/s * 50 s = 3,000,000 km, ignoring relativity. But since the velocity is 0.2c, time dilation is a factor. Therefore, the correct answer must consider gamma. Therefore, 3,061,862 km. But the problem might expect rounding to, say, three significant figures, which is 3.06 million km. Let's check the numerical value of gamma again.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

So, multiplying 60,000 km/s * 50 s * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862.178 km.

But perhaps the problem wants the answer in kilometers without commas, so 3061862 km. But that's seven digits, which is overkill. Alternatively, in scientific notation: 3.06 x 10^6 km.

Alternatively, since the problem gives both numbers as exact (60,000 km/s and 50 s), perhaps the answer is 3,000,000 * gamma = 3,000,000 * 1.020620726 ≈ 3,061,862 km. Therefore, 3,061,862 km.

But maybe we can write it as 3.06 × 10^6 km. However, the problem might expect an exact answer using exact fractions. Let's see:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (1/5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(24/25) = 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)).

Thus, x = (5 / (2 * sqrt(6))) * 60,000 * 50.

Compute:

First, 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

Then, 5 / (2 * sqrt(6)) * 3,000,000.

Compute 5/(2√6):

5/(2*2.449489743) ≈ 5/4.898979 ≈ 1.020620726

Thus, same result. Therefore, the exact answer is (5 / (2 * sqrt(6))) * 3,000,000 km.

But unless the problem wants the answer in terms of sqrt(6), which is unlikely, the decimal form is acceptable.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3,061,862 km, which can be rounded to 3.06 x 10^6 km. Given that the problem probably expects a numerical answer, this would be acceptable.

Alternatively, check with another approach. Suppose we use spacetime intervals. The spacetime interval between the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) is invariant.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the interval is:

Δs² = (c Δt')² - (Δx')² = (c * 50)^2 - 0 = (50c)^2.

In the Galaxy's frame (S), the interval is:

Δs² = (c Δt)^2 - (Δx)^2.

Since intervals are equal:

(c * 50)^2 = (c t)^2 - x²

But x = v t, since the ejecta is moving at velocity v in the Galaxy's frame.

Thus,

(c * 50)^2 = (c t)^2 - (v t)^2

Divide both sides by c²:

50² = t² - (v²/c²) t² = t² (1 - v²/c²)

Therefore,

t² = 50² / (1 - v²/c²)

Thus,

t = 50 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = gamma * 50

Which is the same result as before. Then, x = v t = v gamma * 50 = 0.2c * gamma * 50.

Therefore, the same answer. So, this confirms the calculation.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 3,061,862 km. Depending on the problem's requirement for significant figures, but since the given data is 60,000 km/s (possibly two sig figs) and 50 s (two sig figs), the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km, which is 3,100,000 km. However, given that the exact calculation gives ~3,061,862 km, which is 3.06 million, maybe three sig figs.

But "sixty thousand" is 6.0 x 10^4, which is two sig figs. 50 seconds is two sig figs. So, the answer should be two sig figs: 3.1 x 10^6 km.

But this is a physics problem, and in physics, trailing zeros without a decimal are ambiguous. However, written as "sixty thousand", it's two sig figs. Therefore, the answer is 3.1 million km. But let's check with the initial velocity.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 6.0 x 10^4 km/s, which is two sig figs. 50 seconds is 5.0 x 10^1 s, two sig figs. So, multiplying 6.0 x 10^4 km/s * 5.0 x 10^1 s = 3.0 x 10^6 km, but considering gamma of 1.02 (two sig figs), 3.0 x 1.02 = 3.06 x 10^6 km, which is 3.1 x 10^6 km when rounded to two sig figs.

Therefore, the answer is 3.1 million kilometers. But the exact calculation is approximately 3.06 million. However, given the problem's use of "sixty thousand" and "50", which are two sig figs each, the answer should be two sig figs. Hence, 3.1 x 10^6 km.

But I need to verify once more. If the velocity is 0.2c, then gamma is 1.0206, which is approximately 1.02. Therefore, gamma is approximately two sig figs (1.02). So, 50 s * 1.02 = 51 s. Then, 60,000 km/s * 51 s = 3,060,000 km, which is 3.1 x 10^6 km when rounded to two sig figs.

Alternatively, 3,060,000 km is three sig figs. If the problem allows three sig figs, then 3.06 x 10^6 km. But given the input has two sig figs, the answer should be two. Therefore, 3.1 million km.

But maybe the problem doesn't care about sig figs and wants the precise answer, which is approximately 3,061,862 km. However, in the absence of specific instructions, it's safer to go with significant figures. But let's check the original problem statement again.

The problem says:

"A supernova occurred in our Galaxy. Part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it. What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

No mention of significant figures. It's a numerical problem expecting an exact answer. Given that, perhaps the answer is 3,061,862 km, but to check, maybe it's intended to use a simpler approach. Wait, but the problem says "Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored." So, it's purely a special relativity problem.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the velocity and the time in the ejecta's frame, but using the length contraction formula. Wait, but the distance traveled in the Galaxy frame isn't a length contraction; it's a distance over time. So, that approach isn't applicable.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a simple velocity * time, but considering time dilation. Which is what we did. So, the answer is gamma * v * t'. So, 1.0206 * 60,000 * 50 ≈ 3,061,862 km.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 3,000,000 km, but that would neglect relativistic effects, which are present here. Since the velocity is 0.2c, gamma is about 1.02, so there's a 2% difference. Therefore, the answer must account for that.

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 3,061,862 km, which is about 3.06 million kilometers. Given that, and if the problem expects a box around it, I would present it as \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}} or \boxed{3060000 \text{ km}}.

However, checking once more: if we use exact numbers:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020620726

t = gamma * 50 ≈ 51.0310363 seconds

distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s ≈ 3,061,862.178 km

Rounded to the nearest kilometer, that's 3,061,862 km. But likely, the problem expects the answer in a more compact form. If we convert this to scientific notation with three significant figures, it's 3.06 x 10^6 km. If two sig figs, 3.1 x 10^6 km.

Given that the problem's velocity is 60,000 km/s (which could be two or five sig figs) and 50 seconds (two sig figs), it's safer to go with two sig figs. However, in many contexts, 60,000 written with a space as a thousand separator (as in 60 000 km/s) might be considered five sig figs. For example, in some European notations, spaces are used as thousand separators, so 60 000 is 60,000 with five significant figures. However, since it's written in words as "sixty thousand", which is two sig figs. This is ambiguous.

If it's five sig figs, then gamma would be 1.02062, and the answer would be 3,061,862 km, which is six sig figs. But since the time is 50 seconds (two sig figs), the answer should be two sig figs. So, regardless of the velocity's sig figs, the time's sig figs limit the answer to two. Hence, 3.1 x 10^6 km.

But perhaps the problem expects us to ignore relativistic effects. Let me check with non-relativistic calculation.

If we ignore relativity, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds (ejecta's time). But since the ejecta's time is proper time, and in non-relativistic physics, time is absolute. Therefore, the distance would be 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But the problem states that both frames are inertial and to consider special relativity ("Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are inertial frames of reference."), so we cannot ignore relativity. Therefore, the answer must account for time dilation.

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers. Given that, I think the problem expects this answer. So, writing it as \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6 \text{ km}} or \boxed{3060000 \text{ km}}.

Alternatively, if the problem expects an exact fraction, but that's unlikely. So, based on the calculations, the answer is approximately 3.06 million kilometers.

**Final Answer**
The ejecta travels approximately \boxed{3.06 \times 10^6} kilometers in the Galaxy reference frame.
