To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \frac{\chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi}{\chi^\dagger \chi}
\]

where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

1. **Compute the conjugate transpose \( \chi^\dagger \):**
   \[
   \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Multiply \( \sigma_y \) by \( \chi \):**
   \[
   \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

3. **Compute \( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi \):**
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + 4(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24
   \]

4. **Compute \( \chi^\dagger \chi \):**
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \chi = (-3i)(3i) + 4 \cdot 4 = -9i^2 + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25
   \]

5. **Calculate the expectation value:**
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \frac{-24}{25} = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}
   \]

The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \(\boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}\).

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in the spin state given by the vector (3i, 4). Hmm, let me recall how expectation values work in quantum mechanics. 

I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated by taking the bra vector, multiplying by the operator matrix, then multiplying by the ket vector. So for spin, the operator S_y is related to the Pauli matrix sigma_y. The formula should be something like:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * χ† σ_y χ

Where χ is the spinor (3i, 4), and χ† is its conjugate transpose. And ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, but maybe since they just want the expectation value in terms of ħ, we can keep it as a factor. Wait, but sometimes in these problems, they might use units where ħ=1, but I think here we need to include it because spin matrices are usually (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Let me check.

The Pauli matrix sigma_y is given as:

0  -i
i   0

So S_y would be (ħ/2) times that matrix. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by the inner product of the conjugate transpose of the state with sigma_y acting on the state.

First, let me write down the spinor χ. It's given as (3i, 4). So as a column vector, that's:

3i
4

Then, χ†, the conjugate transpose, would be a row vector with the complex conjugates: (-3i, 4), because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i.

So χ† is (-3i, 4).

Now, σ_y χ is the matrix multiplication of the sigma_y matrix with the χ vector. Let's compute that.

The sigma_y matrix is:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

Multiplying this by the column vector [3i; 4], we get:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = i*3i = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3

So σ_y χ is the vector:

-4i
-3

Now, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times χ† times σ_y χ. So χ† is (-3i, 4), and σ_y χ is (-4i, -3). So multiplying them:

(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3)

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12

So total is -12 + (-12) = -24

Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ

Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check my steps again.

First, the spinor is (3i, 4). Conjugate transpose is (-3i, 4). Then sigma_y multiplied by (3i, 4):

First component: 0*3i + (-i)*4 = -4i

Second component: i*3i + 0*4 = 3i² = -3. So yes, sigma_y χ is (-4i, -3)

Then χ† σ_y χ is (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) = 12i² -12 = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24. So that's correct.

So then ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ. But wait, usually expectation values of spin are ± ħ/2, right? So getting -12 ħ seems way too large. That must mean I made a mistake somewhere.

Hold on. Wait, maybe I messed up the normalization of the state. The spinor given is (3i, 4). Is this a normalized state? Let's check. The norm squared is |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 = 25. So the norm is 5. Therefore, the normalized state would be (3i/5, 4/5). But the problem didn't mention normalization. However, in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized. Wait, but maybe the problem just gives the state as (3i, 4), and expects us to use it as is, even if it's not normalized. But then the expectation value would be different.

Wait, no. The formula for the expectation value is χ† σ_y χ divided by χ† χ, multiplied by ħ/2. Because if the state isn't normalized, you have to normalize it. So the general formula is:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (χ† σ_y χ) / (χ† χ)

In this case, χ† χ is |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 = 25. So the expectation value would be (ħ/2)*(-24)/25 = (-12 ħ)/25. So that's -12/25 ħ. That makes more sense. So maybe I forgot to normalize the state. Let me check the formula again.

Yes, in quantum mechanics, the expectation value is ⟨A⟩ = (ψ† A ψ)/(ψ† ψ) if the state isn't normalized. So if the state is already normalized, then ψ† ψ = 1, and you can ignore the denominator. But in this case, the state (3i, 4) has a norm squared of 25, so it's not normalized. Therefore, I need to divide by 25.

So the correct expectation value is (ħ/2)*(-24)/25 = -12ħ/25. That would be the answer. But let me confirm this step by step.

First, compute the inner product χ† σ_y χ, which is -24. Then compute χ† χ, which is 25. Then divide them: -24/25. Multiply by ħ/2: (-24/25)*(ħ/2) = -12ħ/25. So yes, that's the expectation value.

But wait, the problem says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y." It doesn't specify whether to include the normalization. But in standard QM, expectation values require normalized states. If the state isn't normalized, you have to normalize it. So even if the problem gives a non-normalized state, we need to normalize it when computing the expectation value.

Therefore, the correct answer should be -12ħ/25. But let me check that again.

Original state vector: χ = [3i, 4]^T. Its norm squared is 3i*(-3i) + 4*4 = 9 + 16 = 25, so yes, norm is 5. So normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). Then, the expectation value would be (ħ/2)*( (3i/5, 4/5)† σ_y (3i/5, 4/5) )

But since the calculation is linear, scaling the state by 1/5 would scale the expectation value by (1/5)^2 * 25 = 1/25 *25 = 1. Wait, no. Wait, if you compute χ† σ_y χ for the original χ, which is [3i,4], you get -24. Then divide by χ† χ which is 25, then multiply by ħ/2. So yes, (-24/25)*(ħ/2) = -12ħ/25. Alternatively, if you normalize the state first, then the expectation value is (ħ/2)*(-24)/25. Either way, same result.

So I must have made a mistake initially by not normalizing. Therefore, the correct expectation value is -12ħ/25.

But let me check once more. Let's recompute with the normalized state. Normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). Then χ† is (-3i/5, 4/5). Then σ_y χ is:

First component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (3i^2)/5 = -3/5

So σ_y χ is (-4i/5, -3/5). Then χ† σ_y χ is (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5)

First term: (12i²)/25 = -12/25

Second term: -12/25

Total: -12/25 -12/25 = -24/25. Then multiply by ħ/2: (-24/25)(ħ/2) = -12ħ/25. Yes, same result.

Therefore, the correct expectation value is -12ħ/25. So my initial mistake was forgetting to normalize the state. So the answer should be -12ħ/25.

But wait, the problem statement says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y." It didn't specify whether to give the answer in terms of ħ or as a numerical value. But since ħ is a fundamental constant, we need to include it. So the answer is -12ħ/25.

Alternatively, if the question expects the answer in terms of ħ/2, maybe factor that. Let's see:

-12ħ/25 = -24/25 * (ħ/2). So maybe writing it as -24/25 times ħ/2. But I think either form is acceptable. However, since the operator S_y is (ħ/2)σ_y, then the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the expectation of σ_y. The expectation of σ_y is (χ† σ_y χ)/(χ† χ) = (-24)/25. So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = -12ħ/25. So that's correct.

Therefore, the expectation value is -12ħ/25.

But let me check once more for any possible mistake. Let's recompute the matrix multiplication step-by-step.

Original spinor: χ = [3i; 4]

Conjugate transpose: χ† = [-3i, 4]

σ_y matrix:

[0, -i]

[i, 0]

Multiplying σ_y by χ:

First element: 0*3i + (-i)*4 = -4i

Second element: i*3i + 0*4 = 3i² = -3

So σ_y χ = [-4i; -3]

Then χ† σ_y χ = (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) = (12i²) -12 = -12 -12 = -24

Then χ† χ = (-3i)(3i) + 4*4 = (-9i²) +16 = 9 +16 =25

So ⟨σ_y⟩ = -24/25

Thus ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = -12ħ/25

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.

**Final Answer**
The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.

-4i
-3

Now, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times χ† times σ_y χ. So χ† is (-3i, 4), and σ_y χ is (-4i, -3). So multiplying them:

(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the expectation value of spin along the y-direction (S_y) for an electron in the spin state represented by the vector (3i, 4). In quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * χ† σ_y χ

Where χ is our spinor (3i, 4), χ† is its conjugate transpose, and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-direction. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is included because spin operators are typically (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

The Pauli matrix σ_y is:
[0  -i]
[i   0]

Let me work with the spinor χ, which as a column vector is:
[3i]
[4]

Its conjugate transpose χ† is the row vector (-3i, 4), since the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i.

Next, I'll calculate σ_y χ by matrix multiplication:
[0  -i] [3i] = [-4i]
[i   0] [4]   [-3]

The first component is 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i
The second component is i*(3i) + 0*4 = i*3i = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3

Now I compute the expectation value as (ħ/2) times χ† times σ_y χ:
(ħ/2) * [(-3i, 4)] * [-4i] = (ħ/2) * [(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3
                              [-3]

Sure, let me find the expectation value of spin in the y-direction, S_y, for an electron described by the spin state vector (3i, 4). I need to recall how expectation values are determined in quantum mechanics.

The expectation value of an observable is obtained by taking the bra vector, applying the operator matrix, and then multiplying by the ket vector. In terms of spin, the operator S_y corresponds to the Pauli matrix sigma_y. The formula is likely:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * χ† σ_y χ

Here, χ is the spinor (3i, 4) and χ† is the conjugate transpose. ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, but since they might want the expectation value expressed in terms of ħ, we should retain it as a factor. Sometimes, problems like these use units where ħ=1, but in this case, we should include it because spin matrices are generally (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Let me verify.

The Pauli matrix sigma_y is:

0  -i
i   0

Thus, S_y is (ħ/2) times that matrix. Therefore, the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by the product of the conjugate transpose of the state with sigma_y applied to the state.

First, let's note the spinor χ, which is (3i, 4). As a column vector, it is:

3i
4

Then, for χ†, the conjugate transpose is a row vector with the complex conjugates: (-3i, 4), since the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i.

So χ† is (-3i, 4).

Next, compute σ_y χ as the matrix product of the sigma_y matrix with the χ vector. Let's calculate this.

The sigma_y matrix is:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

If we multiply it by the column vector [3i; 4], we get:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = i*3i = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3

Therefore, σ_y χ yields the vector:

-4i
-3

Finally, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times the product of χ† and σ_y χ. With χ† as (-3i, 4), and σ_y χ as (-4i, -3), the multiplication gives:

(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3

That seems like a large value. Let me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, the spin state is (3i, 4). Let\'s confirm the normalization. The norm squared is |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 = 25, so the state is not normalized. Wait! The expectation value formula requires the state to be normalized, right? Because otherwise, the expectation value would be scaled by the norm squared. So if the state is not normalized, we need to normalize it first.\n\nOh, right! I forgot that. Because in the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = (χ† σ_y χ)/(χ† χ) times (ħ/2). Because the expectation value is ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩ divided by ⟨χ|χ⟩ if the state isn\'t normalized. Since the original problem didn\'t mention normalization, we have to check.\n\nSo first, compute the normalization factor. The inner product χ† χ is (-3i)(3i) + 4*4. Wait, (-3i)(3i) is -9i² = -9*(-1) = 9, and 4*4=16. So total is 9+16=25. So the norm squared is 25, so the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). Therefore, the expectation value would be (ħ/2) * [ (-3i/5, 4/5) σ_y (3i/5, 4/5) ]\n\nWait, but actually, since the original state is not normalized, the expectation value is [ χ† σ_y χ ] / [ χ† χ ] multiplied by ħ/2. So we can do it that way.\n\nSo in my previous calculation, χ† σ_y χ was -24, and χ† χ was 25, so ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = -12ħ/25.\n\nAh, that\'s probably the right answer. So I forgot to divide by the norm squared. Let me verify that.\n\nYes, because the general formula for the expectation value when the state isn\'t normalized is ⟨A⟩ = (ψ† A ψ)/(ψ† ψ). So here, A is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (χ† σ_y χ)/(χ† χ). So since χ† σ_y χ = -24 and χ† χ =25, then ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = -12ħ/25.\n\nSo my initial calculation was missing the normalization. So that\'s a crucial step. The answer should be -12ħ/25. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal spin state: χ = [3i, 4]^T\n\nCompute χ† σ_y χ:\n\nFirst, σ_y χ:\n\n[0*(-3i) + (-i)*4, i*(-3i) + 0*4]^T? Wait, no. Wait, σ_y is 2x2, χ is 2x1. So σ_y χ is:\n\nFirst component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i\n\nSecond component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² = -3\n\nSo σ_y χ = [-4i, -3]^T\n\nThen χ† σ_y χ = (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) = 12i² -12 = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24\n\nThen χ† χ = (-3i)(3i) + 4*4 = -9i² +16 = 9 +16=25\n\nSo ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-12/25)ħ\n\nYes, that\'s correct. So the expectation value is -12ħ/25. So the answer should be -12ħ/25. But since the problem says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y", and given that sigma_y is provided, maybe they just want the numerical factor in front of ħ/2? Wait, let me check the question again.\n\n"Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.\n\nNote: sigma_y (in latex format) is: [[0, -i],[i, 0]]"\n\nSo the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation value of sigma_y. But in the calculation above, we found that the expectation value of sigma_y is (-24)/25, so S_y is (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = -12ħ/25. So the answer is -12ħ/25.\n\nBut maybe the question expects just the numerical coefficient? But probably not. The answer should include ħ. However, in some contexts, especially in introductory quantum mechanics, sometimes people express spin expectation values in units of ħ/2. Wait, but the problem says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y", and S_y is an operator with units of ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix. So the expectation value is in units of ħ/2. Wait, let me confirm.\n\nThe Pauli matrices are dimensionless, so sigma_y is dimensionless, so S_y has units of ħ/2. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ has units of ħ/2. So when they calculate the expectation value, it\'s in terms of multiples of ħ/2.\n\nWait, but in the calculation above, we had ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (expectation of sigma_y). The expectation of sigma_y is (-24/25). So ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-12/25)ħ. Alternatively, if we consider that sigma_y\'s expectation is (-24/25), then S_y is (ħ/2) times that. Either way, the answer should be -12ħ/25.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects just the coefficient in front of ħ/2? For example, if we write ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * ⟨sigma_y⟩, so maybe they want ⟨sigma_y⟩, which is -24/25, and then multiplied by ħ/2. But the question specifically says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y", so S_y is the operator, so the expectation value should be in terms of S_y\'s units, which is ħ/2. So the answer is -12ħ/25. Let me check with units.\n\nIf the state is normalized, the expectation value of sigma_y would be between -1 and 1, since the eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1. But here, the original state wasn\'t normalized. Wait, but after normalization, the state is (3i/5, 4/5). Then, the expectation value of sigma_y would be:\n\nχ† sigma_y χ, with χ being (3i/5, 4/5).

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) and the formula for the expectation value:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \frac{\chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi}{\chi^\dagger \chi}
\]

1. **Conjugate transpose of the spinor \( \chi \):**
   \[
   \chi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

2. **Matrix multiplication of \( \sigma_y \) and \( \chi \):**
   \[
   \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

3. **Inner product \( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi \):**
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + 4(-3) = 12i^2 - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24
   \]

4. **Normalization factor \( \chi^\dagger \chi \):**
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \chi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + 4(4) = 9 + 16 = 25
   \]

5. **Expectation value calculation:**
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \frac{-24}{25} = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}
   \]

Thus, the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12

So total is -12 -12 = -24

Then multiply by (ħ/2): ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ

Wait, but hold on. That seems like a large value. Let me check my steps again.

First, the spin state is (3i, 4). Let's confirm the normalization. The norm squared is |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 = 25, so the state is not normalized. Wait! The expectation value formula requires the state to be normalized, right? Because otherwise, the expectation value would be scaled by the norm squared. So if the state is not normalized, we need to normalize it first.

Oh, right! I forgot that. Because in the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = (χ† σ_y χ)/(χ† χ) times (ħ/2). Because the expectation value is ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩ divided by ⟨χ|χ⟩ if the state isn't normalized. Since the original problem didn't mention normalization, we have to check.

So first, compute the normalization factor. The inner product χ† χ is (-3i)(3i) + 4*4. Wait, (-3i)(3i) is -9i² = -9*(-1) = 9, and 4*4=16. So total is 9+16=25. So the norm squared is 25, so the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). Therefore, the expectation value would be (ħ/2) * [ (-3i/5, 4/5) σ_y (3i/5, 4/5) ]

Wait, but actually, since the original state is not normalized, the expectation value is [ χ† σ_y χ ] / [ χ† χ ] multiplied by ħ/2. So we can do it that way.

So in my previous calculation, χ† σ_y χ was -24, and χ† χ was 25, so ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = -12ħ/25.

Ah, that's probably the right answer. So I forgot to divide by the norm squared. Let me verify that.

Yes, because the general formula for the expectation value when the state isn't normalized is ⟨A⟩ = (ψ† A ψ)/(ψ† ψ). So here, A is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (χ† σ_y χ)/(χ† χ). So since χ† σ_y χ = -24 and χ† χ =25, then ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = -12ħ/25.

So my initial calculation was missing the normalization. So that's a crucial step. The answer should be -12ħ/25. Let me check again.

Original spin state: χ = [3i, 4]^T

Compute χ† σ_y χ:

First, σ_y χ:

[0*(-3i) + (-i)*4, i*(-3i) + 0*4]^T? Wait, no. Wait, σ_y is 2x2, χ is 2x1. So σ_y χ is:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² = -3

So σ_y χ = [-4i, -3]^T

Then χ† σ_y χ = (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) = 12i² -12 = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24

Then χ† χ = (-3i)(3i) + 4*4 = -9i² +16 = 9 +16=25

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-12/25)ħ

Yes, that's correct. So the expectation value is -12ħ/25. So the answer should be -12ħ/25. But since the problem says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y", and given that sigma_y is provided, maybe they just want the numerical factor in front of ħ/2? Wait, let me check the question again.

"Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y.

Note: sigma_y (in latex format) is: [[0, -i],[i, 0]]"

So the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation value of sigma_y. But in the calculation above, we found that the expectation value of sigma_y is (-24)/25, so S_y is (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = -12ħ/25. So the answer is -12ħ/25.

But maybe the question expects just the numerical coefficient? But probably not. The answer should include ħ. However, in some contexts, especially in introductory quantum mechanics, sometimes people express spin expectation values in units of ħ/2. Wait, but the problem says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y", and S_y is an operator with units of ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix. So the expectation value is in units of ħ/2. Wait, let me confirm.

The Pauli matrices are dimensionless, so sigma_y is dimensionless, so S_y has units of ħ/2. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ has units of ħ/2. So when they calculate the expectation value, it's in terms of multiples of ħ/2.

Wait, but in the calculation above, we had ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (expectation of sigma_y). The expectation of sigma_y is (-24/25). So ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = (-12/25)ħ. Alternatively, if we consider that sigma_y's expectation is (-24/25), then S_y is (ħ/2) times that. Either way, the answer should be -12ħ/25.

But perhaps the problem expects just the coefficient in front of ħ/2? For example, if we write ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * ⟨sigma_y⟩, so maybe they want ⟨sigma_y⟩, which is -24/25, and then multiplied by ħ/2. But the question specifically says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y", so S_y is the operator, so the expectation value should be in terms of S_y's units, which is ħ/2. So the answer is -12ħ/25. Let me check with units.

If the state is normalized, the expectation value of sigma_y would be between -1 and 1, since the eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1. But here, the original state wasn't normalized. Wait, but after normalization, the state is (3i/5, 4/5). Then, the expectation value of sigma_y would be:

χ† sigma_y χ, with χ being (3i/5, 4/5). So χ† is (-3i/5, 4/5)

sigma_y χ is:

First component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (3i²)/5 = -3/5

So sigma_y χ = [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T

Then χ† sigma_y χ = (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5)

First term: (12i²)/25 = -12/25

Second term: -12/25

Total: (-12 -12)/25 = -24/25

So yes, ⟨sigma_y⟩ = -24/25, so ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = -12ħ/25.

Therefore, the answer is -12ħ/25. So I think that's correct.

But I need to check if there's any possible mistake. Let me verify the multiplication steps again.

Original spinor: (3i, 4). Conjugate transpose is (-3i, 4). Multiplying by sigma_y applied to (3i,4):

sigma_y*(3i,4) = [0*3i + (-i)*4, i*3i + 0*4] = [ -4i, -3 ]

Then inner product: (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) = 12i² -12 = -12 -12 = -24. Correct.

Then divide by 25, multiply by ħ/2: -24/25 * ħ/2 = -12ħ/25. Correct.

Therefore, the expectation value is -12ħ/25.

Wait, but just to make sure, let's consider if the state was normalized. The normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). Then, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * [ (-3i/5, 4/5) * sigma_y * (3i/5, 4/5) ]

Which gives the same result: (ħ/2)*(-24/25). So yes, same answer.

Alternatively, if someone forgets to normalize, they might have gotten -12ħ, but that's wrong because the state wasn't normalized. So normalization is essential here.

Therefore, the correct expectation value is -12ħ/25.

**Final Answer**
The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction \( S_y \) for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi
\]

where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix for the y-direction:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

First, we normalize the spin state. The norm squared of \( \chi \) is:

\[
|3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25
\]

The normalized spin state is:

\[
\chi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The conjugate transpose \( \chi^\dagger \) is:

\[
\chi^\dagger = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we compute \( \sigma_y \chi \):

\[
\sigma_y \chi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, calculate \( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi \):

\[
\chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{25} \left[ (-3i)(-4i) + 4(-3) \right]
\]

Simplifying the terms:

\[
(-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = -12 \quad \text{and} \quad 4(-3) = -12
\]

Adding these results:

\[
-12 - 12 = -24
\]

Thus,

\[
\chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \frac{-24}{25}
\]

Finally, the expectation value \( \langle S_y \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \times \frac{-24}{25} = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}
\]

The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is:

\[
\boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}
\]

Let's compute each term:
First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12i² = 12*(-1) = -12
Second term: 4*(-3) = -12

Adding them: -12 + (-12) = -24

Multiply by (ħ/2): (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12ħ

But wait, spin expectation values are typically in units of ħ/2. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the expectation value is (χ† σ_y χ) multiplied by (ħ/2). Let me recheck the matrix multiplication.

First, χ† is (-3i, 4). Then σ_y χ is [-4i; -3]. So the product χ† σ_y χ is (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3) = (12i²) + (-12) = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24. So indeed, that's -24. Then multiply by ħ/2, so ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24)*(ħ/2) = -12ħ. But wait, that seems like a large value. However, the possible eigenvalues of S_y are ±ħ/2. Wait, this can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the spinor (3i,4) is not normalized. The expectation value formula requires the state to be normalized. Let me check the normalization. The norm squared is |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 = 25. So the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). Therefore, the expectation value should be calculated using the normalized spinor. I think I forgot to normalize the state first. That's a mistake. The original problem states the electron is in the spin state (3i,4), but to compute expectation values, the state must be normalized. Let's correct that.

First, compute the normalization factor. The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (3i)(-3i) + 16 = 9 + 16 = 25. So the normalized spinor is (3i/5, 4/5).

Now, the expectation value is (ħ/2) times χ† σ_y χ, where χ is the normalized spinor.

So χ = [3i/5; 4/5], χ† = [-3i/5, 4/5]

Now compute σ_y χ:

σ_y χ = [0*(-3i/5) -i*(4/5), i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5)]^T ?

Wait, wait. The Pauli matrix σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so when multiplied by the column vector χ = [3i/5; 4/5], the result is:

First component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = -i*(4/5) = -4i/5

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = i*(3i)/5 = (3i²)/5 = (3*(-1))/5 = -3/5

So σ_y χ = [-4i/5; -3/5]

Now compute χ† σ_y χ:

[-3i/5, 4/5] * [-4i/5; -3/5] = (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5)

First term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12i² = 12*(-1) = -12. Then divided by 5*5=25: -12/25

Second term: (4/5)*(-3/5) = -12/25

Total: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = -24/25

Multiply by ħ/2: ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24/25)*(ħ/2) = (-12/25)ħ

So the expectation value is -12ħ/25.

But let me check again. Wait, when I compute χ† σ_y χ, the first term is (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) = (12i²)/25 = -12/25. The second term is (4/5)*(-3/5) = -12/25. So total is -24/25. Then multiply by ħ/2: (ħ/2)*(-24/25) = -12ħ/25.

Yes, that seems correct. So the expectation value is -12ħ/25. But let me check once more for possible errors.

Alternatively, maybe the user didn't require normalization, but in quantum mechanics, states are typically normalized. The problem says "an electron is in the spin state (3i,4)", but if the state is not normalized, then the expectation value would be (⟨χ|σ_y|χ⟩)/⟨χ|χ⟩ times ħ/2. So maybe the user expects to compute it without normalization, but that's not standard. Let me check both possibilities.

If the state is not normalized, then the expectation value would be (⟨χ|σ_y|χ⟩) * (ħ/2) divided by ⟨χ|χ⟩. So:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (⟨χ|σ_y|χ⟩) / (⟨χ|χ⟩)

In this case, ⟨χ|χ⟩ = 25. So the calculation would be:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) / 25 = -12ħ/25, which is the same result as when normalizing first. So either way, the answer is -12ħ/25.

Therefore, the expectation value of S_y is -12ħ/25.

But let me confirm once more the steps:

1. Check normalization: √(9 +16)=5, so normalized state is (3i/5,4/5)
2. Compute χ† σ_y χ:
   - χ† is [-3i/5,4/5]
   - σ_y χ is [-4i/5, -3/5]
   - Dot product: (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5) = (12i²)/25 + (-12)/25 = (-12 -12)/25 = -24/25
3. Multiply by ħ/2: (-24/25)(ħ/2) = -12ħ/25

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be -12ħ/25. Since the problem says to put the answer in a box, probably expressed as \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}} or similar. But maybe they want it without the ħ, but in the note, they mention σ_y, so maybe they use units where ħ=1? Wait, no, the problem mentions "expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y", and the Pauli matrices are given. In quantum mechanics, the spin operators are S_y = (ħ/2)σ_y, so the expectation value would indeed be (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation of σ_y. But given that the user included σ_y as the matrix, perhaps they want the answer in terms of ħ. So the final answer should be -12ħ/25. But let me check once more.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the numerical factor without ħ, but the problem says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y", and S_y is an operator with units of ħ. So the answer must include ħ. Therefore, the answer is -12ħ/25. So boxed as \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.

**Final Answer**
The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \((3i, 4)\), we follow these steps:

1. **Normalize the spin state**:
   The given spin state is \((3i, 4)\). The norm squared of this state is:
   \[
   |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25
   \]
   The normalized state is:
   \[
   \chi = \left( \frac{3i}{5}, \frac{4}{5} \right)
   \]

2. **Compute the conjugate transpose of the normalized state**:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger = \left( -\frac{3i}{5}, \frac{4}{5} \right)
   \]

3. **Apply the Pauli matrix \(\sigma_y\) to the normalized state**:
   The Pauli matrix \(\sigma_y\) is:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   Multiplying \(\sigma_y\) by the normalized state \(\chi\):
   \[
   \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}
   \begin{pmatrix}
   \frac{3i}{5} \\
   \frac{4}{5}
   \end{pmatrix}
   = \begin{pmatrix}
   -i \cdot \frac{4}{5} \\
   i \cdot \frac{3i}{5}
   \end{pmatrix}
   = \begin{pmatrix}
   -\frac{4i}{5} \\
   -\frac{3}{5}
   \end{pmatrix}
   \]

4. **Calculate the expectation value**:
   The expectation value is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi \right)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \left( -\frac{3i}{5} \right) \left( -\frac{4i}{5} \right) + \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) \left( -\frac{3}{5} \right)
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   \left( -\frac{3i}{5} \right) \left( -\frac{4i}{5} \right) = \frac{12i^2}{25} = -\frac{12}{25}
   \]
   \[
   \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) \left( -\frac{3}{5} \right) = -\frac{12}{25}
   \]
   Summing these terms:
   \[
   -\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = -\frac{24}{25}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( -\frac{24}{25} \right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}
   \]

The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12

So the total is -12 + (-12) = -24

Therefore, the expectation value is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12ħ

Wait, but hold on. The units here. Since the Pauli matrices are multiplied by ħ/2, so S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So when we compute the expectation value, we have:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * [χ† sigma_y χ] = (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12ħ

But that seems like a large value. Let me check the calculation again step by step.

First, the state vector χ is (3i, 4). So as a column vector:

[3i]
[4]

Conjugate transpose χ† is [-3i, 4]

Sigma_y is:

0  -i
i   0

Multiplying sigma_y by χ:

First component: 0*3i + (-i)*4 = -4i

Second component: i*3i + 0*4 = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3

So σ_y χ is:

[-4i]
[-3 ]

Then χ† σ_y χ = (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3)

Calculating each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12

4*(-3) = -12

Sum: -12 + (-12) = -24

Thus, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12ħ

But wait, the spin expectation value for spin-1/2 particles should be ± ħ/2. So getting -12ħ seems way too big, which suggests I must have made a mistake in normalization.

Wait, the state vector (3i, 4) might not be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors are supposed to be normalized to 1. The norm squared is |3i|² + |4|² = 9 + 16 = 25. So the norm is 5. Therefore, the normalized state vector is (3i/5, 4/5). But the problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). So maybe they didn't normalize it. However, when computing expectation values, if the state is not normalized, the formula is:

⟨S_y⟩ = (χ† S_y χ) / (χ† χ)

Because the expectation value is ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩ divided by ⟨χ|χ⟩. So if the state is not normalized, we need to divide by the norm squared.

But wait, in the original problem statement, do they specify that it's a normalized state? The problem says "the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4)". Typically, spin states are given as vectors, which may or may not be normalized. However, when computing expectation values, we need to use the normalized state. Therefore, perhaps the user expects normalization. Let's check.

If the vector is (3i, 4), then the norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25. So the norm is 5. Therefore, the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). Therefore, the expectation value calculation must use the normalized state.

But in the previous calculation, I didn't normalize. Therefore, my answer of -12ħ is incorrect, and I need to adjust for normalization.

So let's redo the calculation with the normalized state.

First, the normalized spinor is:

(3i/5, 4/5). Let's denote this as χ.

Then, χ† is (-3i/5, 4/5).

Then, σ_y χ is:

First component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (3i²)/5 = -3/5

So σ_y χ is:

[-4i/5]

[ -3/5 ]

Then, χ† σ_y χ is:

(-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5)

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) = (12 i²)/25 = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25

Second term: (4/5)*(-3/5) = -12/25

Total: -12/25 -12/25 = -24/25

Then, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12ħ)/25

So that's the expectation value. That makes more sense because the possible eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the expectation value should be between -ħ/2 and ħ/2. But here, -12ħ/25 is approximately -0.48ħ, which is within that range. So that's acceptable.

Therefore, the correct expectation value is -12ħ/25.

But wait, let me confirm once again. The problem says "Find the expectation value of its spin along y-direction, S_y." The note provides sigma_y as the matrix. So perhaps they want the answer in terms of sigma_y, but actually, S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So in the calculation, even after normalization, the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation of sigma_y.

But let's check the steps again:

Original state (3i,4), norm squared 25. So normalized state is (3i/5,4/5). Then, compute χ† sigma_y χ. So:

χ† is [-3i/5,4/5]

sigma_y χ is as above: [-4i/5, -3/5]

Then, χ† sigma_y χ is (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5)

First term: 12i²/25 = -12/25

Second term: -12/25

Total: -24/25

Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2)(-24/25) = -12ħ/25

Yes, that seems correct. So the mistake in the first calculation was not normalizing the state. Therefore, the correct answer should be -12ħ/25.

Alternatively, if the problem assumes the state is already normalized, but in this case, the state (3i,4) is not normalized. Therefore, normalization is required.

Therefore, the answer is -12ħ/25.

But let me check with another approach. Alternatively, using bra-ket notation. The expectation value is ⟨χ | S_y | χ⟩ / ⟨χ | χ⟩.

So, S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. Then,

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ ⟨χ | sigma_y | χ⟩ / ⟨χ | χ⟩ ]

Given that χ is (3i,4), ⟨χ | χ⟩ = 25.

So,

⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * [ (-24) / 25 ] = (-12ħ)/25

Yes, same result.

Therefore, the correct expectation value is -12ħ/25.

**Final Answer**
The expectation value of the spin along the y-direction is \boxed{-\dfrac{12\hbar}{25}}.
