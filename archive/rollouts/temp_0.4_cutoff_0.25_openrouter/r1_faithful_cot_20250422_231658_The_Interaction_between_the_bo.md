The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order are determined by the condition \( 2m_f \leq m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( \psi_f \). The interaction Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y)(v + X(y))\psi_f(y) \) implies that \( X \) couples to fermions proportionally to their mass (\( m_f = \lambda_f v \)). For Standard Model fermions, the allowed decays are:

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&X \to e^+ e^-, \quad X \to \mu^+ \mu^-, \quad X \to \tau^+ \tau^-, \\
&X \to u \bar{u}, \quad X \to d \bar{d}, \quad X \to s \bar{s}, \quad X \to c \bar{c}.
\end{aligned}
}
\]

**Explanation:**  
- **Charged leptons:** Electron (\( e \)), muon (\( \mu \)), and tau (\( \tau \)) masses are \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), and \( 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively, all satisfying \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).  
- **Quarks:** Up (\( u \)), down (\( d \)), strange (\( s \)), and charm (\( c \)) quarks have masses \( 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 96 \, \text{MeV} \), and \( 1.28 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively, also satisfying the kinematic threshold.  
- **Excluded decays:** Bottom (\( b \)) and top (\( t \)) quarks are excluded as \( 2m_b = 8.36 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), and \( m_t \) is far heavier.  
- **Neutrinos:** While kinematically allowed (\( 2m_\nu \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \)), their negligible masses suppress the coupling (\( \lambda_f \propto m_f \)), making the decay width unobservably small. The problem focuses on kinematics, but neutrinos are typically omitted in such listings due to experimental invisibility.  

Thus, the listed decays are the kinematically allowed ones at tree level.

Okay, so I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Hmm, let's start by understanding the interaction term here.

First, the Lagrangian term describes the interaction between the boson X and the fermions ψ_f. The term has a product of the fermion field ψ_f, its Dirac adjoint ψ̄_f, and the boson field X multiplied by a coupling constant λf and a vacuum expectation value v. The term (v + X(y)) suggests that the fermion gets a mass from the vacuum expectation value v, similar to the Higgs mechanism. So, maybe the fermion mass m_f is related to λf * v? Let me check that.

In the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction is something like -λ H ψ̄ ψ, and when H gets a vacuum expectation value v, the mass term becomes -λ v ψ̄ ψ, so the fermion mass is m_f = λ v. So in this case, the mass of the fermion ψ_f would be m_f = λf * v. That makes sense. So the interaction term here is similar to the Higgs-fermion interaction, where X is the fluctuation around the vacuum expectation value v. Therefore, X would couple to the fermions proportionally to their mass, since λf v = m_f, so the coupling is m_f / v.

But the problem here is about the decay of the X boson. Since the X boson is interacting with the fermions ψ_f, the possible decay channels would be X decaying into a pair of fermion and anti-fermion, right? So X → ψ_f + ψ̄_f. But we need to check if this decay is kinematically allowed. For a decay to be allowed, the mass of the decaying particle must be at least twice the mass of the decay products. So, the mass of X, which is 6 GeV, must be greater than or equal to 2*m_f. So 2*m_f ≤ 6 GeV, which implies m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Therefore, X can decay into any fermion ψ_f whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

But wait, we need to know the masses of the fermions in question. The problem doesn't specify what kind of fermions ψ_f are. Are they Standard Model fermions? Or some other fermions? The problem mentions "fermions" in general, so maybe we have to assume they are Standard Model fermions? But the question is about kinematically allowed decays at lowest order. So if X couples to all fermions, then the allowed decays would be into fermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV.

In the Standard Model, the fermions are quarks and leptons. The masses of the charged leptons are electron (0.511 MeV), muon (105.7 MeV), tau (1.777 GeV). The quarks have masses like up (2.2 MeV), down (4.7 MeV), strange (96 MeV), charm (1.28 GeV), bottom (4.18 GeV), top (173 GeV). Neutrinos are very light, so their masses are negligible.

But wait, the X boson has a mass of 6 GeV. So if we consider decays into Standard Model fermions, then the possible fermion pairs would be:

- Electron-positron: each 0.511 MeV, total ~1.022 MeV << 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Muon-antimuon: each 105.7 MeV, total ~211.4 MeV << 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Tau-antitau: each 1.777 GeV, total ~3.554 GeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Up quark-antiquark: each 2.2 MeV, total ~4.4 MeV. Allowed.

- Down quark-antiquark: ~9.4 MeV. Allowed.

- Strange quark-antiquark: ~192 MeV. Allowed.

- Charm quark-antiquark: each 1.28 GeV, total ~2.56 GeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Bottom quark-antiquark: each 4.18 GeV, total ~8.36 GeV > 6 GeV. Not allowed.

- Top quark-antiquark: way too heavy, 173 GeV each. Not possible.

Neutrinos have negligible mass, so X → ν ν̄ would be allowed, but since neutrinos are neutral, but in the interaction term, if the fermions ψ_f are charged, then neutrinos might not be included. Wait, the problem says "fermions", but doesn't specify. However, in the interaction Lagrangian, it's ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. If the fermions are charged, then X would be a neutral boson to make the term gauge invariant. Alternatively, if X is a neutral scalar, then ψ_f could be any fermion.

Assuming X is a neutral scalar (like the Higgs), then it can decay into charged fermion-antifermion pairs or neutral fermion-antifermion pairs. But neutrinos are neutral, so if ψ_f is a neutrino, then X would decay into neutrino-antineutrino. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs doesn't couple to neutrinos directly unless they have a Yukawa coupling, which in the Standard Model they don't (unless we consider neutrino masses via the Higgs). But in this problem, since the interaction is given, we can assume that ψ_f includes all fermions that have a Yukawa coupling with X. So if neutrinos are included, then X can decay into them, but since their masses are negligible, the decay is allowed.

But kinematically, even if the fermion is massless, the decay is allowed. Wait, but for a boson to decay into two massless fermions, the phase space would still allow it, right? The threshold is when the fermion mass is zero, so any massless fermion pair can be produced as long as the boson has positive mass. But in reality, for a spin-0 boson decaying into two fermions, the matrix element might depend on the fermion mass. Wait, the interaction term is proportional to (v + X) ψ̄_f ψ_f. So when you expand this, you get the mass term m_f ψ̄_f ψ_f and the interaction term λf X ψ̄_f ψ_f. Therefore, the coupling of X to the fermions is proportional to m_f (since m_f = λf v). Therefore, the decay width would be proportional to m_f^2. So even if the fermion is massless, the coupling would be zero, and the decay width would be zero. Therefore, even though the phase space allows it, the amplitude is zero if the fermion is massless.

So in reality, the decay X → ψ_f ψ̄_f is only possible if the fermion has non-zero mass, and the coupling is proportional to the mass. Therefore, even though neutrinos have tiny masses, their coupling to X would be extremely small, making the decay width negligible. However, the question is about kinematically allowed decays, not about the decay width or the likelihood. So even if the coupling is small, as long as the kinematics allow it, it's allowed.

But since the problem says "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order", we need to check if 2m_f ≤ m_X. For each fermion type, if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV, then the decay is allowed.

So considering Standard Model fermions:

- Electron: 2m_e = 1.022 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed.

- Muon: 2m_μ = 211.4 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed.

- Tau: 2m_τ = 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed.

- Up quark: 2m_u = 4.4 MeV: allowed.

- Down quark: 2m_d = 9.4 MeV: allowed.

- Strange quark: 2m_s = 192 MeV: allowed.

- Charm quark: 2m_c = 2.56 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed.

- Bottom quark: 2m_b = 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV: not allowed.

- Top quark: way too heavy.

Neutrinos: 2m_ν ≈ 0 < 6 GeV: allowed, but as discussed, their coupling is proportional to their mass, which is negligible, but kinematically allowed.

However, the problem might be considering only charged fermions, or maybe the fermions in the Lagrangian are the ones that get mass via this interaction. But the problem statement just says "fermions", so we might have to assume all possible fermions that satisfy 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

But wait, the interaction term is given as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So for each fermion f, there's a separate coupling λf. Therefore, X couples to each fermion f with strength proportional to λf, which is m_f / v. So the decay X → f f̄ is possible for each f where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

But the problem is asking for the kinematically allowed decays, not the actual observable decays, which would depend on the coupling strength. So even if the coupling is tiny, as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X, it's allowed.

Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays are X decaying into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion mass is ≤ 3 GeV.

Given that, in the Standard Model, the fermions with mass ≤ 3 GeV are: electron, muon, tau, up, down, strange, charm quarks. The bottom quark is 4.18 GeV, so 2m_b = 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV, so not allowed. The top is way heavier. Neutrinos are allowed kinematically, but their masses are tiny, so their decays would be suppressed, but still allowed in kinematics.

However, if the fermions in question are not Standard Model fermions, but some other fermions with different masses, then we can't say. But since the problem doesn't specify, we have to assume Standard Model fermions, or perhaps the fermions that are involved in the interaction. But given that the Lagrangian is written generally as ψ_f, it's probably any fermion that couples to X via that term.

But another thing to consider: in the Standard Model, the Higgs boson couples to fermions proportional to their mass, and thus can decay to the heaviest fermions possible. But the Higgs is much heavier (125 GeV), so it can decay to bottom quarks, tau leptons, etc. In this case, the X boson is 6 GeV, so lighter.

But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. The J/ψ meson is around 3 GeV, and the Υ meson is around 9.5 GeV. But here we're talking about a boson X with mass 6 GeV. So if this is a hypothetical boson, maybe similar to the Higgs but lighter. However, the Higgs is part of a weak doublet, but X here seems to be a singlet since the interaction is Yukawa-like.

But regardless, focusing on kinematics. The possible decays are to fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV. In the Standard Model, the heaviest fermion under 3 GeV is the charm quark (1.28 GeV) and the tau lepton (1.777 GeV). Wait, 1.777 GeV * 2 = 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV, so the tau is allowed. Charm quark is 1.28 * 2 = 2.56 GeV < 6 GeV. So both are allowed.

So the kinematically allowed decays at lowest order (tree-level) would be:

X → e+ e-

X → μ+ μ-

X → τ+ τ-

X → u ū

X → d d̄

X → s s̄

X → c c̄

And the corresponding neutrinos if they are included in the fermions ψ_f. But since neutrinos are neutral, the interaction term would have to be for neutral fermions. However, in the Standard Model, neutrinos have negligible Yukawa couplings, but in this case, the problem doesn't specify. If the Lagrangian includes neutrinos, then X → ν ν̄ is possible, but again, the coupling is proportional to the neutrino mass, which is very small. However, the question is about kinematic allowance, not the coupling strength. So technically, if the fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV, the decay is allowed.

But wait, neutrinos have masses << 1 eV, so 2m_ν is negligible compared to 6 GeV. So they are allowed. But in practice, the decay width would be negligible because the coupling is so small. But the question is about kinematic allowance, not the actual probability.

However, in particle physics, when we talk about kinematically allowed decays, we usually consider whether the decay is possible based on energy/momentum conservation and mass thresholds, regardless of the coupling. So even if the coupling is zero (i.e., m_f = 0), the decay would still be kinematically allowed, but the amplitude would be zero. But perhaps in this context, the question is considering the coupling given by the interaction term. Since the interaction term is proportional to (v + X), which gives a coupling proportional to m_f, then if m_f = 0, the coupling is zero, and the decay is not possible. So maybe we need to consider only fermions with non-zero mass, but with 2m_f ≤ m_X.

But the problem states "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order". The kinematic allowance is purely based on the mass, but the existence of the decay channel at lowest order requires that the interaction term exists. Since the interaction term is given as coupling to ψ_f, and the coupling is present, then even if m_f is zero, the interaction term is present (λf * X ψ̄_f ψ_f), but if m_f = 0, then λf = 0 (since m_f = λf v). Therefore, if m_f = 0, λf = 0, so the coupling is zero. Thus, even though the decay is kinematically allowed, the amplitude is zero, so the decay doesn't occur. Therefore, the decay channels are only for fermions with m_f > 0, such that λf ≠ 0, and 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Therefore, the fermions must have non-zero mass (i.e., m_f = λf v > 0) and 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. So m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Therefore, the allowed decays are into fermion pairs where m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

In the Standard Model, this includes:

- Charged leptons: e, μ, τ (since m_τ ≈ 1.777 GeV ≤ 3 GeV)

- Quarks: u, d, s, c (m_c ≈ 1.28 GeV ≤ 3 GeV)

But the bottom quark is too heavy (m_b ≈ 4.18 GeV), so 2m_b ≈ 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV, so excluded.

Neutrinos: if they have non-zero mass (which they do), but their masses are extremely small (on the order of eV or less), so m_ν << 3 GeV, so they are allowed. However, since their masses are so small, the coupling λf = m_f / v would be negligible, making the decay width negligible. But again, the question is about kinematic allowance, not the width. However, if the fermion mass is non-zero, then technically the decay is allowed. But in practice, for such small masses, the decay would be highly suppressed. However, the problem doesn't specify to consider experimental feasibility, just kinematic allowance.

But given that the problem mentions "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order", I think we should list all fermions with 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV, assuming they have non-zero mass. Therefore, including neutrinos. However, in many models, neutrinos are either Majorana fermions or have different couplings, but given the Lagrangian here, if neutrinos are part of ψ_f, then they would have Dirac masses via the same mechanism. But in the Standard Model, neutrinos don't have Dirac masses unless we extend it.

But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we should assume that the fermions ψ_f are the ones that get their mass through this interaction, implying that they are massive Dirac fermions. Therefore, if X couples to them, then their masses are m_f = λf v. Therefore, if we assume that all the fermions ψ_f have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV, then X can decay into them. But the problem doesn't specify the masses of the fermions, only the mass of X. Wait, the problem says "the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV". It doesn't give the fermion masses. Therefore, we have to infer from the interaction term.

Given that the interaction term is L = -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f, this implies that the fermion mass is m_f = λf v. Therefore, the mass of the fermion is proportional to λf. However, without knowing the value of v or λf, we can't determine m_f. But the problem states that the mass of X is 6 GeV. Wait, but how is the mass of X related to v? In the Higgs mechanism, the mass of the Higgs boson is related to the vacuum expectation value and the quartic coupling. For example, m_H = sqrt(2λ) v. But here, the problem doesn't provide a potential for X, so we can't determine v or λ. However, the question is about the decay products, not the parameters of the model.

Wait, perhaps the mass of X is given as 6 GeV, but the fermion masses are determined by m_f = λf v, and we need to see which fermions have 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. However, without knowing v or λf, we can't compute m_f. This seems like a problem. Unless we assume that v is the same as in the Standard Model, which is 246 GeV. Then m_f = λf * 246 GeV. But if that's the case, then m_f would be in the range of Standard Model fermion masses if λf is of the order of the Yukawa couplings. For example, for the top quark, λf ≈ 1 (since m_top ≈ 173 GeV ≈ λ_top * 246 GeV → λ_top ≈ 0.7). So if X is a Higgs-like boson with v = 246 GeV, then m_f = λf * 246 GeV. But the mass of X would be determined by the potential parameters, which aren't given here. The problem only states that the mass of X is 6 GeV. But unless we have more information about the potential, we can't relate v to m_X.

Wait, but the problem gives the interaction Lagrangian but not the potential for X. Therefore, we can't determine v from the given information. So perhaps we are to assume that the fermion masses are independent of X's mass, and the only given is that X's mass is 6 GeV. Therefore, the decay channels depend solely on the fermion masses, which are not provided. But this is a problem because we need to know the fermion masses to determine the kinematic allowed decays.

Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that the fermions in question are the ones that acquire mass from the vacuum expectation value v, and X is the boson associated with the symmetry breaking. Therefore, similar to the Higgs boson, X would have a mass that is related to the symmetry breaking scale, but again, without knowing the potential, we can't say. However, the problem states that the mass of X is 6 GeV, and asks for the kinematically allowed decays. If we don't know the fermion masses, we can't answer. But since the problem is posed, there must be an assumption we can make.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the interaction term is L = -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f, which is the standard Yukawa interaction. Therefore, the mass of the fermion is m_f = λf v. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV, but in the Higgs mechanism, the mass of the scalar boson is m_X^2 = 2λ v^2, where λ is the quartic coupling in the potential. However, since the problem doesn't give the potential, we can't relate m_X to v. Therefore, perhaps the question is independent of the specific value of v and just wants us to note that the decay X → ψ_f ψ̄_f is allowed if 2m_f ≤ m_X. Since m_f = λf v, and m_X = 6 GeV, the condition is 2λf v ≤ 6 GeV. But without knowing λf or v, we can't determine which fermions satisfy this. Therefore, the problem must be assuming that the fermion masses are such that m_f ≤ 3 GeV, and thus the decay is allowed. But how do we know which fermions are below this threshold?

This seems contradictory. The problem must be missing some information, or I'm missing a key point. Wait, perhaps the question is not referring to Standard Model fermions but to some other fermions. If the fermions ψ_f are new fermions introduced in the model, and their masses are generated through the coupling with X, then the mass of each ψ_f is m_f = λf v. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. If we assume that the vacuum expectation value v is the same as the one in the Standard Model (246 GeV), then m_f = λf * 246 GeV. For m_f ≤ 3 GeV, we need λf ≤ 3 / 246 ≈ 0.0122. So Yukawa couplings less than about 0.012. Therefore, the fermions would be very light, similar to the electron or lighter. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, if v is much smaller, say v = 6 GeV, then m_f = λf * 6 GeV. For m_f ≤ 3 GeV, λf ≤ 0.5. But again, without knowing v, we can't determine m_f.

But the problem doesn't provide any information about v or the fermion masses. Therefore, the only way to answer is to assume that the fermions are such that their masses are below 3 GeV, and thus the decays X → ψ_f ψ̄_f are allowed for those fermions. However, since the problem mentions "the kinematically allowed decays", it's possible that the answer is simply all fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV, i.e., m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Therefore, the allowed decays are X → f f̄ for each fermion f with m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

But since the problem doesn't specify the fermion content, maybe it's a trick question where the only possible decay is X → ψ_f ψ̄_f for a single fermion f, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the boson X can decay into any fermion pairs, regardless of their mass, but that contradicts kinematics.

Wait, another thought: in the interaction term, the coupling is proportional to (v + X). When you expand this, you get a mass term m_f = λf v and an interaction term λf X. Therefore, the coupling of X to the fermions is proportional to λf, which is m_f / v. Therefore, the decay width for X → f f̄ would be proportional to (m_f / v)^2 * m_X. But the question is about kinematic allowance, not the width. So even if the width is small, the decay is allowed if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

But since the problem doesn't specify the fermion masses, how can we answer? Maybe the answer is that the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, as long as the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV. But without knowing the fermion masses, we can't list specific decay channels. However, if we assume Standard Model fermions, then as previously listed, the decays into e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, and the quark pairs uū, dđ, sš, cč are allowed, while decays into b b̄, t t̄ are forbidden.

But the problem doesn't specify that the fermions are Standard Model ones. However, given the context of particle physics and the structure of the interaction term, it's reasonable to assume they are. Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays at lowest order are:

X → e+ e-

X → μ+ μ-

X → τ+ τ-

X → quark-antiquark pairs (uū, dđ, sš, cč)

But wait, quarks are confined, so the actual observable decays would be into hadrons. However, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order, which would be the quark-level decays. So even though the quarks hadronize, the underlying decay is X → q q̄.

Similarly, for the tau, it's a lepton, so X → τ+ τ- is a direct decay.

Similarly for electrons and muons.

So the answer should list all fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. In the Standard Model, those are:

- Charged leptons: e, μ, τ

- Quarks: u, d, s, c

Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays are:

X → e+ e-

X → μ+ μ-

X → τ+ τ-

X → u ū

X → d d̄

X → s s̄

X → c c̄

Additionally, if neutrinos are part of the fermions ψ_f and have non-zero mass (even tiny), then X → ν ν̄ is also allowed. But since neutrinos are neutral, the decay products would be invisible. However, the problem doesn't specify whether neutrinos are included. If we assume that ψ_f includes all fermions, including neutrinos, then X → ν ν̄ is allowed. But given that the problem mentions "fermions" without qualification, it's safer to include them, noting that the coupling is proportional to their mass, which is very small, but kinematically allowed.

But in many models, neutrinos are treated as Majorana particles, but in this case, the interaction term is ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f, which is a Dirac mass term. So if neutrinos are Dirac particles, then they would have a small mass and the decay X → ν ν̄ is allowed. However, experimentally, such decays are undetectable because neutrinos are hard to observe. But again, the question is about kinematic allowance, not detectability.

Therefore, considering all possibilities, the kinematically allowed decays at lowest order are all fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion mass is ≤ 3 GeV. For Standard Model fermions, this includes the charged leptons e, μ, τ; the quarks u, d, s, c; and the neutrinos. However, since the problem doesn't specify the nature of the fermions, the answer should probably list the charged leptons and the quarks up to charm.

But let's confirm the quark masses. The charm quark mass is about 1.28 GeV, so 2 * 1.28 = 2.56 GeV < 6 GeV, so allowed. The bottom quark is 4.18 GeV, so 2 * 4.18 = 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV, excluded. The top quark is way too heavy. The strange quark is about 96 MeV, so 2 * 96 = 192 MeV < 6 GeV. Up and down quarks are a few MeV, so definitely allowed.

Therefore, the allowed quark decays are u, d, s, c. The allowed lepton decays are e, μ, τ, and neutrinos. So including all of them.

But in summary, the answer should list these decays. However, typically in particle physics, when listing decays, we use the standard names for the particles. For quarks, since they form jets, the decay would be into two jets (for each quark pair), but at the fundamental level, it's the quark-antiquark pairs.

So putting it all together, the kinematically allowed decays of the X boson at lowest order are:

- Electrons: X → e⁺ e⁻

- Muons: X → μ⁺ μ⁻

- Taus: X → τ⁺ τ⁻

- Up quarks: X → u ū

- Down quarks: X → d d̄

- Strange quarks: X → s s̄

- Charm quarks: X → c ĉ

And if neutrinos are included, X → ν ν̄ for each neutrino flavor. But since neutrinos are typically not listed in decay products due to their negligible couplings and experimental invisibility, unless specified. However, the question is purely about kinematics.

Given that, I think the expected answer is that the boson X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where twice the fermion's mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Since the problem mentions "kinematically allowed", we should list all such pairs. Assuming Standard Model fermions, the answer includes the charged leptons (e, μ, τ) and the quarks (u, d, s, c). Neutrinos are a bit of a edge case, but if included, they would also be allowed.

However, to match standard answers, perhaps they expect listing the charged leptons and the quarks, excluding neutrinos. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that the fermions are heavy, and only certain ones are allowed. But given the information, I think we should include all possible.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. Hmm, let's start by understanding the interaction term here.

First, the Lagrangian term describes the interaction between the boson X and the fermions ψ_f. The term has a product of the fermion field ψ_f, its Dirac adjoint ψ̄_f, and the boson field X multiplied by a coupling constant λf and a vacuum expectation value v. The term (v + X(y)) suggests that the fermion gets a mass from the vacuum expectation value v, similar to the Higgs mechanism. So, maybe the fermion mass m_f is related to λf * v? Let me check that.

In the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction is something like -λ H ψ̄ ψ, and when H gets a vacuum expectation value v, the mass term becomes -λ v ψ̄ ψ, so the fermion mass is m_f = λ v. So in this case, the mass of the fermion ψ_f would be m_f = λf * v. That makes sense. So the interaction term here is similar to the Higgs-fermion interaction, where X is the fluctuation around the vacuum expectation value v. Therefore, X would couple to the fermions proportionally to their mass, since λf v = m_f, so the coupling is m_f / v.

But the problem here is about the decay of the X boson. Since the X boson is interacting with the fermions ψ_f, the possible decay channels would be X decaying into a pair of fermion and anti-fermion, right? So X → ψ_f + ψ̄_f. But we need to check if this decay is kinematically allowed. For a decay to be allowed, the mass of the decaying particle must be at least twice the mass of the decay products. So, the mass of X, which is 6 GeV, must be greater than or equal to 2*m_f. So 2*m_f ≤ 6 GeV, which implies m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Therefore, X can decay into any fermion ψ_f whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

But wait, we need to know the masses of the fermions in question. The problem doesn't specify what kind of fermions ψ_f are. Are they Standard Model fermions? Or some other fermions? The problem mentions "fermions" in general, so maybe we have to assume they are Standard Model fermions? But the question is about kinematically allowed decays at lowest order. So if X couples to all fermions, then the allowed decays would be into fermion pairs where the fermion mass is less than 3 GeV.

In the Standard Model, the fermions are quarks and leptons. The masses of the charged leptons are electron (0.511 MeV), muon (105.7 MeV), tau (1.777 GeV). The quarks have masses like up (2.2 MeV), down (4.7 MeV), strange (96 MeV), charm (1.28 GeV), bottom (4.18 GeV), top (173 GeV). Neutrinos are very light, so their masses are negligible.

But wait, the X boson has a mass of 6 GeV. So if we consider decays into Standard Model fermions, then the possible fermion pairs would be:

- Electron-positron: each 0.511 MeV, total ~1.022 MeV << 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Muon-antimuon: each 105.7 MeV, total ~211.4 MeV << 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Tau-antitau: each 1.777 GeV, total ~3.554 GeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Up quark-antiquark: each 2.2 MeV, total ~4.4 MeV. Allowed.

- Down quark-antiquark: ~9.4 MeV. Allowed.

- Strange quark-antiquark: ~192 MeV. Allowed.

- Charm quark-antiquark: each 1.28 GeV, total ~2.56 GeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Bottom quark-antiquark: each 4.18 GeV, total ~8.36 GeV > 6 GeV. Not allowed.

- Top quark-antiquark: way too heavy, 173 GeV each. Not possible.

Neutrinos have negligible mass, so X → ν ν̄ would be allowed, but since neutrinos are neutral, but in the interaction term, if the fermions ψ_f are charged, then neutrinos might not be included. Wait, the problem says "fermions", but doesn't specify. However, in the interaction Lagrangian, it's ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. If the fermions are charged, then X would be a neutral boson to make the term gauge invariant. Alternatively, if X is a neutral scalar, then ψ_f could be any fermion.

Assuming X is a neutral scalar (like the Higgs), then it can decay into charged fermion-antifermion pairs or neutral fermion-antifermion pairs. But neutrinos are neutral, so if ψ_f is a neutrino, then X would decay into neutrino-antineutrino. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs doesn't couple to neutrinos directly unless they have a Yukawa coupling, which in the Standard Model they don't (unless we consider neutrino masses via the Higgs). But in this problem, since the interaction is given, we can assume that ψ_f includes all fermions that have a Yukawa coupling with X. So if neutrinos are included, then X can decay into them, but since their masses are negligible, the decay is allowed.

But kinematically, even if the fermion is massless, the decay is allowed. Wait, but for a boson to decay into two massless fermions, the phase space would still allow it, right? The threshold is when the fermion mass is zero, so any massless fermion pair can be produced as long as the boson has positive mass. But in reality, for a spin-0 boson decaying into two fermions, the matrix element might depend on the fermion mass. Wait, the interaction term is proportional to (v + X) ψ̄_f ψ_f. So when you expand this, you get the mass term m_f ψ̄_f ψ_f and the interaction term λf X ψ̄_f ψ_f. Therefore, the coupling of X to the fermions is proportional to m_f (since m_f = λf v). Therefore, the decay width would be proportional to m_f^2. So even if the fermion is massless, the coupling would be zero, and the decay width would be zero. Therefore, even though the phase space allows it, the amplitude is zero if the fermion is massless.

So in reality, the decay X → ψ_f ψ̄_f is only possible if the fermion has non-zero mass, and the coupling is proportional to the mass. Therefore, even though neutrinos have tiny masses, their coupling to X would be extremely small, making the decay width negligible. However, the question is about kinematically allowed decays, not about the decay width or the likelihood. So even if the coupling is small, as long as the kinematics allow it, it's allowed.

But since the problem says "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order", we need to check if 2m_f ≤ m_X. For each fermion type, if 2m_f ≤ 6

I need to determine the kinematically allowed decays of boson X at lowest order, with the interaction Lagrangian L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), where the mass of X is 6 GeV.

Let me first understand this interaction term. This Lagrangian describes the interaction between boson X and fermions ψ_f. It includes the fermion field ψ_f, its Dirac adjoint ψ̄_f, and boson field X, multiplied by coupling constant λf and vacuum expectation value v. The term (v + X(y)) indicates the fermion gains mass from the vacuum expectation value v, similar to the Higgs mechanism. The fermion mass m_f is likely related to λf * v.

In the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction looks like -λ H ψ̄ ψ, and when H acquires a vacuum expectation value v, the mass term becomes -λ v ψ̄ ψ, making the fermion mass m_f = λ v. So here, m_f = λf * v. This interaction resembles the Higgs-fermion interaction, with X representing the fluctuation around v. X would therefore couple to fermions proportionally to their mass, with coupling m_f / v.

For the decay of X boson, since X interacts with fermions ψ_f, possible decay channels would be X → ψ_f + ψ̄_f. For this decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the decay products. With X having a mass of 6 GeV, we need 2*m_f ≤ 6 GeV, which means m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at Standard Model fermions:

- Electron-positron: each 0.511 MeV, total ~1.022 MeV << 6 GeV. Allowed.
- Muon-antimuon: each 105.7 MeV, total ~211.4 MeV << 6 GeV. Allowed.
- Tau-antitau: each 1.777 GeV, total ~3.554 GeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.
- Up quark-antiquark: each 2.2 MeV, total ~4.4 MeV. Allowed.
- Down quark-antiquark: ~9.4 MeV. Allowed.
- Strange quark-antiquark: ~192 MeV. Allowed.
- Charm quark-antiquark: each 1.28 GeV, total ~2.56 GeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.
- Bottom quark-antiquark: each 4.18 GeV, total ~8.36 GeV > 6 GeV. Not allowed.
- Top quark-antiquark: 173 GeV each. Not possible.

For neutrinos with negligible mass, X → ν ν̄ would be kinematically allowed. However, the coupling would be proportional to the fermion mass (since m_f = λf v), so the decay width would be proportional to m_f². Thus, for massless fermions, even though phase space allows the decay, the amplitude would be zero. For neutrinos with tiny masses, the coupling to X would be extremely small, making the decay width negligible.

Nevertheless, the question focuses on "kinematically allowed" decays, not decay widths or probabilities. So as long as 2m_f ≤ m_X (6 GeV), the decay is kinematically permitted.

Alright, so I need to determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order given the interaction Lagrangian L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's start by analyzing this interaction term.

This Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson X and fermions ψ_f. It includes the fermion field ψ_f, the Dirac adjoint ψ̄_f, and the boson field X, all multiplied by a coupling constant λf and a vacuum expectation value v. The term (v + X(y)) indicates that the fermion gains a mass through the vacuum expectation value v, reminiscent of the Higgs mechanism. This implies that the fermion mass m_f might be represented by λf * v. Let me verify that.

In the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction is typically -λ H ψ̄ ψ, and when H acquires a vacuum expectation value v, it becomes -λ v ψ̄ ψ, making the fermion mass m_f = λ v. Thus, here, the fermion ψ_f's mass would be m_f = λf * v. This matches. So this interaction term resembles the Higgs-fermion interaction, where X is the deviation from the vacuum expectation value v. Therefore, X couples to fermions proportionally to their mass, since λf v = m_f, meaning the coupling is m_f / v.

However, the issue at hand is the decay of the X boson. Given that the X boson interacts with fermions ψ_f, the potential decay channels would be X decaying into a fermion and anti-fermion pair, so X → ψ_f + ψ̄_f. But we need to ensure that this decay is kinematically feasible. For the decay to occur, the decaying particle's mass must be at least twice the mass of the decay products. Thus, the mass of X, which is 6 GeV, needs to be at least 2*m_f. This leads to 2*m_f ≤ 6 GeV, therefore m_f ≤ 3 GeV. Hence, X can decay into any fermion ψ_f whose mass is ≤ 3 GeV.

However, we must know the specific masses of the relevant fermions. The problem does not specify the type of fermions ψ_f. Are they Standard Model fermions or other types? It mentions "fermions" generally, which might imply Standard Model fermions? But since the problem involves kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order, assuming X couples to all fermions, the decays would involve fermion pairs where the fermion mass is under 3 GeV.

In the Standard Model, fermions consist of quarks and leptons. Charged lepton masses are electron (0.511 MeV), muon (105.7 MeV), tau (1.777 GeV). Quark masses include up (2.2 MeV), down (4.7 MeV), strange (96 MeV), charm (1.28 GeV), bottom (4.18 GeV), and top (173 GeV). Neutrinos have extremely small masses.

Considering the X boson's 6 GeV mass, and taking Standard Model fermions into account, feasible fermion pairs include:

- Electron-positron: each 0.511 MeV, total ~1.022 MeV << 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Muon-antimuon: each 105.7 MeV, total ~211.4 MeV << 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Tau-antitau: each 1.777 GeV, total ~3.554 GeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Up quark-antiquark: each 2.2 MeV, total ~4.4 MeV. Allowed.

- Down quark-antiquark: ~9.4 MeV. Allowed.

- Strange quark-antiquark: ~192 MeV. Allowed.

- Charm quark-antiquark: each 1.28 GeV, total ~2.56 GeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Bottom quark-antiquark: each 4.18 GeV, total ~8.36 GeV > 6 GeV. Not allowed.

- Top quark-antiquark: vastly heavier, at 173 GeV each. Not feasible.

Given neutrinos' negligible mass, X → ν ν̄ would generally be allowed, although neutrinos are neutral, meaning their inclusion depends on whether ψ_f in the interaction terms are charged. However, the problem broadly refers to "fermions", which leaves room for interpretation. If X is a neutral scalar, then ψ_f could be any fermion. Assuming X is neutral, like the Higgs, it could decay into both charged and neutral fermion-antifermion pairs. While under standard assumptions, the Higgs doesn't directly couple to neutrinos unless there's a Yukawa interaction, we can posit that ψ_f includes all fermions interacting with X. Therefore, if neutrinos are included, X could decay into them, though given their minimal masses, their contribution is almost negligible.

Kinematically, if a fermion is massless, decay remains possible. For a boson to decay into two massless fermions, the phase space still permits it. The coupling, derived from terms like (v + X) ψ̄_f ψ_f, provides a mass term m_f ψ̄_f ψ_f and interaction λf X ψ̄_f ψ_f, making the coupling of X to fermions dependent on mass m_f. The decay width is consequently proportional to m_f². Hence, if the fermion is massless, the coupling and decay width are zero. Despite the phase space permitting decay into massless fermions, the null amplitude disallows it.

Practically, the decay X → ψ_f ψ̄_f is feasible only if the fermion has a non-zero mass, aligning the coupling with the mass. Although neutrinos have minuscule masses and minuscule coupling with X, making their decay width negligible, the problem concerns kinematically feasible decays, not their width or probability. Hence, even with minor coupling, kinematically, any allowed decay can occur.

Finally, checking the condition 2m_f ≤ m_X for each fermion ensures that such decays are allowed if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

So even though the quark-antiquark pairs hadronize, the decay process itself is allowed if the quark masses are below the threshold.\n\nBut wait, quark masses are a bit ambiguous because they are not directly observable (due to confinement), but in the context of such problems, we usually use the current quark masses.

The bottom quark is too heavy.\n\nAdditionally, if there are any other fermions in the theory, but the problem doesn\'t mention them, so we can assume Standard Model fermions.\n\nTherefore, the kinematically allowed decays at lowest order are into each fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV. So that includes all the charged leptons up to tau, and all quarks up to charm.\n\nBut wait, the problem might be considering only charged fermions, but neutrinos are also fermions. If neutrinos are Dirac particles with small masses, then X could decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs.

So if we take that approach, then all fermions with m_f ≤ 3 GeV are allowed. In the Standard Model, that\'s e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. So seven possible fermion-antifermion pairs.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is in a model where X only couples to certain fermions, but the problem statement doesn\'t specify, so we have to assume it couples to all fermions for which the interaction is given. But the Lagrangian is written generally as ψ_f, which could be any fermion. Since the question is about kinematically allowed decays, we need to consider all possible ψ_f that satisfy 2m_f ≤ m_X.\n\nTherefore, the answer should list all fermion pairs (charged leptons and quarks) with masses ≤ 3 GeV. So the kinematically allowed decays are:\n\nX → e⁺ e⁻,\n\nX → μ⁺ μ⁻,\n\nX → τ⁺ τ⁻,\n\nX → u ū,\n\nX → d d̄,\n\nX → s s̄,\n\nX → c c̄.\n\nBut since the problem mentions "the fermions ψ_f", which are the ones interacting with X, and if in the model all these fermions are present and have masses below 3 GeV, then those are the allowed decays.\n\nAlternatively, if the fermions are beyond the Standard Model, but since the problem doesn\'t specify, we have to go with Standard Model fermions.\n\nAnother point: the interaction term is written as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. This suggests that X is a real scalar boson because it\'s Hermitian (assuming ψ̄_f and ψ_f are Dirac fields). A complex scalar would have X and X†, but here it\'s just X. So X is a real scalar, which can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a real scalar, the decay would be to a particle-antiparticle pair, which for charged fermions is e⁺ e⁻, etc., and for neutral fermions (like neutrinos), it would be ν ν̄, but again, only if they have Majorana masses or Dirac masses. But in the Standard Model, neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana with tiny masses.\n\nBut since we are considering kinematic limits, and the problem doesn\'t restrict to charged fermions, neutrinos would also be allowed. However, their masses are so small that 2m_ν ≈ 0 < 6 GeV. But again, the coupling is proportional to m_ν, which is negligible, but kinematically allowed.\n\nHowever, the problem might not expect us to consider neutrinos because they are not usually considered in such decays unless specified. But strictly speaking, they are fermions, so if the interaction includes them, they should be considered. But given that the problem doesn\'t specify, maybe we should exclude them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fermions in question are the ones that get mass from the vacuum expectation value v, similar to the Higgs. In the Standard Model, the Higgs gives mass to the charged fermions, but neutrinos are either massless or get mass via a different mechanism. So if this X boson is analogous to the Higgs, then it would couple to the charged fermions but not neutrinos. However, the problem statement doesn\'t specify this, so we can\'t be sure.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering the usual exam-type questions, they probably expect the answer to include the charged leptons (e, μ, τ) and the quarks (u, d, s, c) as the kinematically allowed decays, since their masses are below 3 GeV.

The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order are determined by the interaction Lagrangian:
\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left( \upsilon + X(y) \right) \psi_f(y),
\]
where the boson \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \) with a coupling proportional to their mass \( m_f = \lambda_f \upsilon \). For the decay \( X \to \psi_f \bar{\psi}_f \) to be kinematically allowed, the boson mass \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \) must satisfy \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), i.e., \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

Considering Standard Model fermions with masses below \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), the allowed decays are:
\[

GeV, then the decay is allowed. So let's list the fermions and their masses:

- Electron: 0.511 MeV. 2m_e = 1.022 MeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Muon: 105.7 MeV. 2m_μ = 211.4 MeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Tau: 1.777 GeV. 2m_τ = 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Up quark: 2.2 MeV. 2m_u = 4.4 MeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Down quark: 4.7 MeV. 2m_d = 9.4 MeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Strange quark: 96 MeV. 2m_s = 192 MeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Charm quark: 1.28 GeV. 2m_c = 2.56 GeV < 6 GeV. Allowed.

- Bottom quark: 4.18 GeV. 2m_b = 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV. Not allowed.

- Top quark: 173 GeV. Way too heavy.

Neutrinos: each less than eV scale. 2m_ν ~ eV << 6 GeV. Allowed, but coupling is negligible.

But the problem is likely referring to the fermions that are part of the interaction Lagrangian. If the Lagrangian includes all fermions, then all fermions with 2m_f <= 6 GeV are allowed. However, in practice, the coupling is proportional to m_f, so heavier fermions have stronger couplings, hence larger decay widths.

But the question is about kinematically allowed decays, not the actual branching ratios. So even if the decay to electrons is possible, it's allowed, even though the rate might be small.

But wait, the problem says "kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order". So we need to consider all possible fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f <= m_X = 6 GeV.

In the Standard Model, the fermions with masses below 3 GeV are: electron, muon, tau, up, down, strange, charm. The bottom quark is 4.18 GeV, so 2m_b = 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV, so X cannot decay into bottom-antibottom. Similarly, top is too heavy. So the kinematically allowed decays are:

X → e+ e-

X → μ+ μ-

X → τ+ τ-

X → u ū

X → d d̄

X → s s̄

X → c c̄

But since quarks are confined, the decays into quarks would result in hadrons. However, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the particle level, not about the detectable products. So even though the quark-antiquark pairs hadronize, the decay process itself is allowed if the quark masses are below the threshold.

But wait, quark masses are a bit ambiguous because they are not directly observable (due to confinement), but in the context of such problems, we usually use the current quark masses. The charm quark has a mass of about 1.28 GeV, so 2.56 GeV < 6 GeV, so allowed. The bottom quark is too heavy.

Additionally, if there are any other fermions in the theory, but the problem doesn't mention them, so we can assume Standard Model fermions.

Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays at lowest order are into each fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV. So that includes all the charged leptons up to tau, and all quarks up to charm.

But wait, the problem might be considering only charged fermions, but neutrinos are also fermions. If neutrinos are Dirac particles with small masses, then X could decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs. However, as mentioned before, the coupling is proportional to the fermion mass, so even though kinematically allowed, the decay width would be negligible. But again, the question is about kinematic allowance, not the actual probability.

However, the problem statement doesn't specify whether the fermions ψ_f are charged or neutral. The interaction term could be for any fermions. If neutrinos are included, then technically X can decay into ν ν̄, but since the coupling is proportional to m_ν, which is extremely small, the decay is negligible. But kinematically, it's allowed.

But maybe the problem expects us to consider only the fermions for which 2m_f ≤ m_X, regardless of the coupling strength. So if we take that approach, then all fermions with m_f ≤ 3 GeV are allowed. In the Standard Model, that's e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. So seven possible fermion-antifermion pairs.

Alternatively, if the problem is in a model where X only couples to certain fermions, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so we have to assume it couples to all fermions for which the interaction is given. But the Lagrangian is written generally as ψ_f, which could be any fermion. Since the question is about kinematically allowed decays, we need to consider all possible ψ_f that satisfy 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Therefore, the answer should list all fermion pairs (charged leptons and quarks) with masses ≤ 3 GeV. So the kinematically allowed decays are:

X → e⁺ e⁻,

X → μ⁺ μ⁻,

X → τ⁺ τ⁻,

X → u ū,

X → d d̄,

X → s s̄,

X → c c̄.

But since the problem mentions "the fermions ψ_f", which are the ones interacting with X, and if in the model all these fermions are present and have masses below 3 GeV, then those are the allowed decays.

Alternatively, if the fermions are beyond the Standard Model, but since the problem doesn't specify, we have to go with Standard Model fermions.

Another point: the interaction term is written as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. This suggests that X is a real scalar boson because it's Hermitian (assuming ψ̄_f and ψ_f are Dirac fields). A complex scalar would have X and X†, but here it's just X. So X is a real scalar, which can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a real scalar, the decay would be to a particle-antiparticle pair, which for charged fermions is e⁺ e⁻, etc., and for neutral fermions (like neutrinos), it would be ν ν̄, but again, only if they have Majorana masses or Dirac masses. But in the Standard Model, neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana with tiny masses.

But since we are considering kinematic limits, and the problem doesn't restrict to charged fermions, neutrinos would also be allowed. However, their masses are so small that 2m_ν ≈ 0 < 6 GeV. But again, the coupling is proportional to m_ν, which is negligible, but kinematically allowed.

However, the problem might not expect us to consider neutrinos because they are not usually considered in such decays unless specified. But strictly speaking, they are fermions, so if the interaction includes them, they should be considered. But given that the problem doesn't specify, maybe we should exclude them.

Alternatively, maybe the fermions in question are the ones that get mass from the vacuum expectation value v, similar to the Higgs. In the Standard Model, the Higgs gives mass to the charged fermions, but neutrinos are either massless or get mass via a different mechanism. So if this X boson is analogous to the Higgs, then it would couple to the charged fermions but not neutrinos. However, the problem statement doesn't specify this, so we can't be sure.

Given the ambiguity, but considering the usual exam-type questions, they probably expect the answer to include the charged leptons (e, μ, τ) and the quarks (u, d, s, c) as the kinematically allowed decays, since their masses are below 3 GeV. The bottom quark is too heavy, as 2m_b exceeds 6 GeV.

So, compiling the answer:

The kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order are into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:

- Electron and positron (e⁺ e⁻)

- Muon and antimuon (μ⁺ μ⁻)

- Tau and antitau (τ⁺ τ⁻)

- Up quark and up antiquark (u ū)

- Down quark and down antiquark (d d̄)

- Strange quark and strange antiquark (s s̄)

- Charm quark and charm antiquark (c c̄)

These are all the fermions with masses ≤ 3 GeV, making their pair production possible given the X boson's mass of 6 GeV.

If neutrinos have mass, even tiny, then X → ν ν̄ would be allowed, but the coupling would be negligible, but kinematically allowed. However, the problem states "lowest order" decay. If the coupling is zero (for massless neutrinos), then the decay is not possible. If neutrinos are massive, but the coupling is non-zero, then it\'s allowed. Since the problem doesn\'t specify, perhaps we can assume that neutrinos are massless here, so their decays are not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be set in a model where X couples only to the fermions that get their mass via this interaction. So if a fermion\'s mass comes from this Higgs-like mechanism (v), then X couples to it. If neutrinos are Dirac and get their mass the same way, then X can decay into them. If they are Majorana or have a different mass mechanism, then perhaps not. But the problem statement is probably simplified, so let\'s assume that all charged leptons and quarks (except top and bottom) are allowed.\n\nBut wait, the mass of the charm quark is ~1.28 GeV, so 2.56 GeV total, which is less than 6 GeV.

Therefore, all charged leptons and the quarks up, down, strange, charm. The neutrinos are excluded if they are massless, but if they have tiny masses, they would be allowed but with negligible coupling. Since the problem states "kinematically allowed", and if neutrinos have any mass, even small, then X → ν ν̄ would be allowed. But if neutrinos are massless, then not. However, in the Standard Model, neutrinos have mass, but in this problem, it\'s not specified. Since the interaction term is similar to the Higgs, which doesn\'t couple to neutrinos if they are massless, but in reality neutrinos have mass. So, if we assume neutrinos have non-zero mass, then X → ν ν̄ would be allowed if 2m_ν < 6 GeV. But neutrino masses are on the order of eV, so 2m_ν << 6 GeV. Therefore, kinematically allowed, but the coupling is proportional to m_ν, so the decay width is negligible. However, the question is about kinematic allowance, not the actual probability. If the problem follows the Standard Model where neutrinos have tiny masses, then technically X can decay into all three neutrino species. But maybe the problem expects considering only charged fermions. Since the original Lagrangian uses ψ_f, which could be any fermion, but if neutrinos are part of ψ_f, then they would be included. But since the problem doesn\'t specify, perhaps the answer should include neutrino pairs as well. However, given that the mass is 6 GeV, and neutrino masses are negligible, the phase space is there, but the coupling is zero if neutrinos are massless. If the problem assumes that neutrinos are massless, then X cannot decay into them. If they have mass, even tiny, then yes.

The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV at the lowest order are determined by the interaction Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\). This interaction implies that \( X \) couples to fermions proportional to their mass \( m_f = \lambda_f \upsilon \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the condition \( 2m_f \leq m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \) must hold. 

**Allowed decay channels:**
1. **Charged leptons:**
   - \( X \to e^+ e^- \) (electron-positron pair, \( 2m_e \approx 1.02 \, \text{MeV} \))
   - \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \) (muon-antimuon pair, \( 2m_\mu \approx 211 \, \text{MeV} \))
   - \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \) (tau-antitau pair, \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.55 \, \text{GeV} \))

2. **Quarks:**
   - \( X \to c \bar{c} \) (charm-anticharm pair, \( 2m_c \approx 2.56 \, \text{GeV} \))
   - \( X \to s \bar{s} \) (strange-antistrange pair, \( 2m_s \approx 192 \, \text{MeV} \))
   - \( X \to u \bar{u} \) (up-antiup pair, \( 2m_u \approx 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \))
   - \( X \to d \bar{d} \) (down-antidown pair, \( 2m_d \approx 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \))

**Excluded decays:**
- \( X \to b \bar{b} \) and \( X \to t \bar{t} \) are kinematically forbidden (\( 2m_b \approx 8.36 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- Decays into neutrinos (\( \nu \bar{\nu} \)) are excluded if neutrinos are massless (coupling \( \lambda_f = 0 \)). Even with tiny neutrino masses, the decay width is negligible.

Thus, the **kinematically allowed decays** of \( X \) at tree level are:  
\[
\boxed{X \to e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, c \bar{c}, \, s \bar{s}, \, u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}}
\]

However, if the coupling is proportional to m_f, then even if kinematically allowed, the decay might not occur if m_f is zero. But the problem states "kinematically allowed," so perhaps we can ignore coupling strength.

But wait, in the interaction Lagrangian, the coupling is λf, which is related to the mass via m_f = λf v. Therefore, if a fermion has m_f = 0, then λf = 0, so there's no coupling. Hence, X doesn't decay into that fermion. So only fermions with non-zero mass (i.e., those that get their mass from the Higgs mechanism) would have a coupling and thus a decay channel.

Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays would be to fermion-antifermion pairs where m_f ≤ 3 GeV and the fermion has non-zero mass. So:

Electron-positron: allowed, but since m_e is very small, but non-zero, so possible. Similarly for muon, tau (since m_tau ~1.777 GeV), charm (1.28 GeV), etc. But wait, charm quark mass is around 1.28 GeV, so 2.56 GeV total, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into charm-anticharm. But bottom quarks are 4.18 GeV each, so 8.36 GeV total, which is more than 6 GeV. So not allowed.

So possible decays:

X → e+ e-

X → μ+ μ-

X → τ+ τ-

X → c c̄

X → s s̄

X → u ū

X → d d̄

But in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to fermions proportional to their mass. So the Higgs can decay to the heaviest possible fermion pairs allowed. However, in the case of the given X boson with mass 6 GeV, which is much lighter than the actual Higgs boson (125 GeV), but here the X is 6 GeV. So the possible decay channels would be similar but limited by the mass.

But wait, the actual Higgs can't decay into τ+ τ- because 3.55 GeV < 125 GeV. But here, m_X is 6 GeV. So τ+ τ- is allowed (3.55 GeV < 6 GeV). Similarly, charm quarks (2.56 GeV) are allowed. But in reality, the Higgs decay to charm quarks is very suppressed and hard to detect, but kinematically allowed. Here, the question is about kinematic allowance.

So for X boson of 6 GeV, all Standard Model fermions with masses less than 3 GeV would be allowed. So:

Leptons: e, μ, τ (since τ is 1.777 GeV each, so 3.554 GeV total < 6 GeV)

Quarks: up (2.2 MeV), down (4.7 MeV), strange (96 MeV), charm (1.28 GeV). But bottom is 4.18 GeV each, so 8.36 GeV, which is too heavy.

Wait, but quarks are confined, so decay into quark-antiquark pairs would result in hadrons. However, the problem statement might not be considering hadronization, just the decay into the quark pairs. So kinematically, X → c c̄ is allowed (2.56 GeV total), but X → b b̄ is not (8.36 GeV). Similarly, for the top quark, which is way too heavy.

So the allowed decays are into all charged leptons (e, μ, τ) and all quarks except top and bottom. However, neutrinos have negligible masses, so even though m_X is larger than 2m_ν, the coupling λf is zero (since m_ν ≈ 0), so X does not decay into neutrinos. Therefore, neutrino channels are not allowed despite kinematics.

So, summarizing:

- Charged leptons: e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-

- Quarks: u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄

But quarks are confined, so in reality, X would decay into mesons or other hadrons. However, the question likely expects the answer in terms of the fundamental fermions. So the kinematically allowed decays at lowest order are all fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. But we have to check if the coupling exists. Since the coupling is proportional to m_f, fermions with m_f = 0 would not couple. So neutrinos are out. But all charged fermions have non-zero mass. However, in the Standard Model, neutrinos have tiny masses, but if in this model, neutrinos are massless, then X can't decay into them. If neutrinos have mass, even tiny, then X → ν ν̄ would be allowed, but the coupling would be negligible, but kinematically allowed. However, the problem states "lowest order" decay. If the coupling is zero (for massless neutrinos), then the decay is not possible. If neutrinos are massive, but the coupling is non-zero, then it's allowed. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that neutrinos are massless here, so their decays are not allowed.

Alternatively, the problem might be set in a model where X couples only to the fermions that get their mass via this interaction. So if a fermion's mass comes from this Higgs-like mechanism (v), then X couples to it. If neutrinos are Dirac and get their mass the same way, then X can decay into them. If they are Majorana or have a different mass mechanism, then perhaps not. But the problem statement is probably simplified, so let's assume that all charged leptons and quarks (except top and bottom) are allowed.

But wait, the mass of the charm quark is ~1.28 GeV, so 2.56 GeV total, which is less than 6 GeV. So charm is allowed. Similarly, the strange quark is 96 MeV, so 192 MeV. So yes.

So the allowed decays are:

- X → e+ e-

- X → μ+ μ-

- X → τ+ τ-

- X → c c̄

- X → s s̄

- X → u ū

- X → d d̄

But in terms of Standard Model particles, the quarks will hadronize, but the question asks for kinematically allowed decays, so probably listing the fundamental fermion pairs.

But maybe the problem expects considering the Higgs-like couplings. However, the Higgs boson doesn't decay into muons or electrons much because the branching ratio is tiny, but kinematically allowed. Similarly here, even though the coupling is proportional to mass, the question is about kinematic allowance, not the likelihood.

Therefore, the answer should list all fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ m_X = 6 GeV. For Standard Model fermions, this includes all charged leptons except maybe tau? Wait, tau is 1.777 GeV each, so 2*1.777 = 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau is allowed. For quarks, up, down, strange, charm. Bottom and top are too heavy.

Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays are:

X can decay into electron-positron, muon-antimuon, tau-antitau, charm-anticharm, strange-antistrange, up-antiup, and down-antidown pairs.

But since the problem mentions "at the lowest order", which refers to tree-level processes. The interaction term is a Yukawa coupling, so decays would proceed via X → f f̄ at tree level. So all these fermion pairs are allowed.

Therefore, the answer is that the kinematically allowed decays are X → e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, c c̄, s s̄, u ū, and d d̄. But since u, d, s, c quarks are involved, their decays would result in jets, but the question is about allowed decays regardless of the final state's observability.

Wait, but in the Standard Model, the Higgs can't decay to quark-antiquark pairs (except maybe c c̄) because of confinement, but in terms of particle physics, the decay is to quark pairs which then form hadrons. However, the problem is theoretical, so we can list the quark-antiquark pairs.

Hence, the answer should list all fermion species with mass less than 3 GeV. Therefore, all charged leptons and the quarks up, down, strange, charm. The neutrinos are excluded if they are massless, but if they have tiny masses, they would be allowed but with negligible coupling. Since the problem states "kinematically allowed", and if neutrinos have any mass, even small, then X → ν ν̄ would be allowed. But if neutrinos are massless, then not. However, in the Standard Model, neutrinos have mass, but in this problem, it's not specified. Since the interaction term is similar to the Higgs, which doesn't couple to neutrinos if they are massless, but in reality neutrinos have mass. So, if we assume neutrinos have non-zero mass, then X → ν ν̄ would be allowed if 2m_ν < 6 GeV. But neutrino masses are on the order of eV, so 2m_ν << 6 GeV. Therefore, kinematically allowed, but the coupling is proportional to m_ν, so the decay width is negligible. However, the question is about kinematic allowance, not the actual probability. If the problem follows the Standard Model where neutrinos have tiny masses, then technically X can decay into all three neutrino species. But maybe the problem expects considering only charged fermions. Since the original Lagrangian uses ψ_f, which could be any fermion, but if neutrinos are part of ψ_f, then they would be included. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the answer should include neutrino pairs as well. However, given that the mass is 6 GeV, and neutrino masses are negligible, the phase space is there, but the coupling is zero if neutrinos are massless. If the problem assumes that neutrinos are massless, then X cannot decay into them. If they have mass, even tiny, then yes. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we should exclude neutrinos, as in the minimal Higgs case where neutrinos are massless. Hence, the answer includes only charged leptons and quarks.

Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays of X at lowest order are:

X → e⁺ e⁻, μ⁺ μ⁻, τ⁺ τ⁻, c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄.

But in terms of particle names, usually written as:

X → e+ e-, X → μ+ μ-, X → τ+ τ-, X → c c̄, X → s s̄, X → u ū, X → d d̄.

Alternatively, using quark names, but since they are not observed as free particles, but in the context of decay channels, it's acceptable to list them as quark pairs.

Therefore, the final answer should list all these possible fermion-antifermion pairs where the sum of their masses is less than 6 GeV.

However, the problem states "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order." The lowest order decay would be tree-level processes. Given the interaction term, the decay X → ψ_f ψ̄_f is a tree-level process. Hence, all fermions with 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV are allowed. However, the actual answer depends on the specific model\'s fermion content.\n\nBut the problem does not specify whether ψ_f refers to all Standard Model fermions or a particular one. If the interaction is with a specific fermion ψ_f, then only that fermion\'s pair would be considered. But the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f, which might be for a single fermion species f. But the subscript f could denote different fermion species.

So, for each fermion species f, there\'s a term with coupling λf. So X couples to each fermion species f with coupling λf. Therefore, the possible decays are X → ψ_f ψ̄_f for each fermion f where 2m_f ≤ m_X.\n\nTherefore, if we take f to run over all Standard Model fermions, then X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion\'s mass is ≤3 GeV. So, as per Standard Model masses, the allowed decays would be:\n\n- X → e+ e-\n\n- X → μ+ μ-\n\n- X → τ+ τ-\n\n- X → u ū\n\n- X → d d̄\n\n- X → s s̄\n\n- X → c c̄\n\nBut not to b b̄ or t t̄. However, quarks cannot exist as free particles, so in reality, the boson would decay into hadrons when decaying into quark-antiquark pairs. However, the question is about kinematically allowed decays, not about confinement. So even though quarks are confined, the decay X → q q̄ is kinematically allowed if 2m_q ≤ m_X. Therefore, the answer should include all fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.\n\nBut the problem does not specify whether X is a scalar, vector boson, etc. The interaction term is of the form scalar (X) times fermion bilinear, so X is a scalar boson. The Higgs boson is a scalar, so similar to the Higgs, X would decay into fermion pairs. The spin of X would be 0. Therefore, the decay is allowed for all fermions with mass ≤3 GeV.\n\nHence, the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order (tree level) are all possible fermion-antifermion pairs where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Given that each fermion\'s mass is less than 3 GeV, the pairs would be:\n\n- Electrons, muons, taus, up, down, strange, charm quarks, and their antiparticles.\n\nBut the problem says "the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X at the lowest order." Since the interaction term is with fermions, the lowest order decay is X → ψ_f ψ̄_f for each f. Hence, the answer is that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion\'s mass is at most 3 GeV. Therefore, the allowed decays are:\n\n- X → e+ e-\n\n- X → μ+ μ-\n\n- X → τ+ τ-\n\n- X → u ū\n\n- X → d d̄\n\n- X → s s̄\n\n- X → c c̄\n\nBut since quarks are confined, the actual observable decays would involve jets (for light quarks) or specific mesons for heavier quarks. However, the question is about kinematically allowed decays, not the experimental signatures. So all the above are allowed. Additionally, if neutrinos are Dirac fermions (with distinct particles and antiparticles), then X → ν ν̄ would be possible if neutrinos have mass. However, neutrino masses are very small, so even if allowed kinematically, the coupling would be extremely weak. But since the problem only asks for kinematically allowed decays, even neutrino pairs would be allowed if 2m_ν ≤ m_X. Given that neutrino masses are below 1 eV, this is certainly true, but if the coupling exists. However, in the Standard Model, neutrinos only interact via the Higgs if they have a Yukawa coupling, which for Dirac neutrinos would be the case. However, in the minimal Standard Model, neutrinos are massless, so X would not decay into neutrinos. But if we extend to include massive neutrinos, then X → ν ν̄ would be allowed. But the problem does not specify, so perhaps we should assume only charged fermions?\n\nAlternatively, the original interaction term is given as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. If ψ_f includes neutrinos, then they can decay into neutrinos. But if neutrinos are Majorana, they are their own antiparticles, but the decay would still be X → ν ν. However, in terms of Feynman diagrams, for a scalar boson decaying into two Majorana fermions, the amplitude is similar. But given the problem\'s ambiguity, perhaps we should not include neutrinos unless specified. The problem mentions "fermions," so perhaps neutrinos are included, but given their negligible mass, the decay is kinematically allowed but with negligible branching ratio. However, the problem is not about probabilities, only kinematic allowance.\n\nBut the key point is whether the interaction allows X to couple to neutrinos. If ψ_f is any fermion, then yes. However, in the Standard Model, the Higgs couples to fermions proportionally to their mass, but neutrinos (if Dirac) would have tiny couplings. But again, the problem does not specify whether neutrinos are included. Since the problem is in a theoretical context, perhaps we should consider all possible fermions ψ_f that are in the theory. If the theory includes neutrinos with mass, then X can decay into them. If neutrinos are massless, then m_f = 0, so the coupling would be zero (since m_f = λf v), so X would not decay into neutrinos. But if neutrinos are massive, then even with tiny masses, the decay is allowed. However, given that the problem states the boson\'s mass is 6 GeV, which is much larger than the neutrino masses, the decay is kinematically allowed.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of the problem, the fermions ψ_f are only the charged ones. Since the interaction term is similar to the Higgs Yukawa coupling, which for the Standard Model Higgs couples to charged fermions. But in extensions with massive neutrinos, the Higgs can couple to neutrinos as well. However, the problem does not specify, so we can\'t be certain. However, given that the problem is asking for kinematically allowed decays, and assuming that all possible fermions (including neutrinos) are in the theory with masses less than 3 GeV, then X can decay into all of them. But given that in reality, even with neutrino masses, they are way below 3 GeV, the decay is allowed. However, the coupling would be proportional to the fermion mass, so neutrino decays would be highly suppressed, but kinematically allowed.\n\nBut perhaps the answer expected here is the list of Standard Model fermions with masses below 3 GeV. So electrons, muons, taus, and the up, down, strange, charm quarks. So their respective pairs. Therefore, the kinematically allowed decays are:\n\n- X → e+ e-\n\n- X → μ+ μ-\n\n- X → τ+ τ-\n\n- X → c c̄\n\n- X → s s̄\n\n- X → u ū\n\n- X → d d̄\n\nBut the problem might not expect the separation into quark flavors, since quarks are not observed as free particles. However, in particle physics, when we talk about decays, we often refer to the fundamental particles produced, even if they hadronize. So, for example, the Higgs boson decays to quark-antiquark pairs (like bb̄), which then form jets. So, even though we don\'t see free quarks, the decay is still considered as X → q q̄.\n\nTherefore, the answer should include all fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. For Standard Model fermions, that\'s all except top and bottom quarks. Hence, the kinematically allowed decays are into electron, muon, tau, charm, strange, up, and down pairs, along with their antiparticles. If neutrinos are included, they would also be allowed, but given their negligible mass, but unless specified, perhaps the answer expects only the charged fermions and quarks.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the allowed decays are:\n\nX can decay into any charged lepton-antilepton pair (e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-), and any quark-antiquark pair (u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄) at the lowest order.

The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order are determined by the interaction Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left( \upsilon + X(y) \right) \psi_f(y),
\]

where the boson \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \) with a coupling proportional to their mass \( m_f = \lambda_f \upsilon \). For a decay \( X \to \psi_f \bar{\psi}_f \), the kinematic condition \( 2m_f \leq m_X \) must hold. Given \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are allowed. 

**Standard Model fermion masses (approximate):**
- Charged leptons: \( e^\pm \) (0.511 MeV), \( \mu^\pm \) (105.7 MeV), \( \tau^\pm \) (1.777 GeV)
- Quarks: \( u \) (2.2 MeV), \( d \) (4.7 MeV), \( s \) (96 MeV), \( c \) (1.28 GeV), \( b \) (4.18 GeV), \( t \) (173 GeV)
- Neutrinos: \( \nu \) (\( \ll 1 \, \text{eV} \))

**Kinematically allowed decays** (ignoring quark confinement and assuming neutrinos are negligible or massless):
- **Charged leptons:**  
  \( X \to e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- **Quarks:**  
  \( X \to u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}, \, s \bar{s}, \, c \bar{c} \)

**Forbidden decays:**  
- \( X \to b \bar{b} \) (\( 2m_b = 8.36 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \))  
- \( X \to t \bar{t} \) (mass too large).

**Final Answer:**  
The boson \( X \) can decay at the lowest order into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:  
\[
\boxed{X \to e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}, \, s \bar{s}, \, c \bar{c}}
\]

Therefore, for each fermion:

- Electron: 2m_e = ~1.022 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed.

- Muon: 211.4 MeV < 6 GeV: allowed.

- Tau: 3.554 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed.

- Charm: 2.56 GeV < 6 GeV: allowed.

- Bottom: 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV: forbidden.

Hence, X can decay into all fermion-antifermion pairs except for bottom-antibottom and top-antitop. However, the problem states "kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order." The lowest order decay would be tree-level processes. Given the interaction term, the decay X → ψ_f ψ̄_f is a tree-level process. Hence, all fermions with 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV are allowed. However, the actual answer depends on the specific model's fermion content.

But the problem does not specify whether ψ_f refers to all Standard Model fermions or a particular one. If the interaction is with a specific fermion ψ_f, then only that fermion's pair would be considered.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). The subscript f is repeated, which could be an index over different fermion species. So, for each fermion species f, there's a term with coupling λf. So X couples to each fermion species f with coupling λf. Therefore, the possible decays are X → ψ_f ψ̄_f for each fermion f where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Therefore, if we take f to run over all Standard Model fermions, then X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion's mass is ≤3 GeV. So, as per Standard Model masses, the allowed decays would be:

So, putting it all together, the allowed decays are:

X can decay into any charged lepton-antilepton pair (e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-), and any quark-antiquark pair (u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄) at the lowest order. The bottom quark-antiquark pair (b b̄) is not allowed because 2m_b = 8.36 GeV > 6 GeV, and top is way too heavy. If neutrinos are considered and have non-zero mass, X → ν ν̄ would also be allowed, but given the problem's context, it might be omitted.

Therefore, the final answer would list these decay channels.
