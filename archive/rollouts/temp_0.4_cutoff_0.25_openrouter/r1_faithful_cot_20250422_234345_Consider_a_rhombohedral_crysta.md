To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Å and angles α = β = γ = 30°, we use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:

\[
\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) \sin^2 \alpha + 2(hk + kl + lh)(\cos^2 \alpha - \cos \alpha)}{a^2 (1 - 3 \cos^2 \alpha + 2 \cos^3 \alpha)}
\]

Given:
- \( h = 1 \), \( k = 1 \), \( l = 1 \)
- \( a = 10 \) Å
- \( \alpha = 30^\circ \)

First, compute the trigonometric values:
- \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)
- \( \sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( \cos^2 30^\circ = \frac{3}{4} \)
- \( \cos^3 30^\circ = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \)

Calculate the numerator:
\[
(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) \sin^2 30^\circ + 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1)(\cos^2 30^\circ - \cos 30^\circ)
\]
\[
= 3 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + 6 \left(\frac{3}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
\]
\[
= 0.75 + 6 \left(0.75 - 0.8660254\right)
\]
\[
= 0.75 + 6(-0.1160254)
\]
\[
= 0.75 - 0.6961524
\]
\[
= 0.0538476
\]

Calculate the denominator:
\[
a^2 (1 - 3 \cos^2 \alpha + 2 \cos^3 \alpha)
\]
\[
= 10^2 \left(1 - 3 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) + 2 \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\right)
\]
\[
= 100 \left(1 - 2.25 + 1.2990381\right)
\]
\[
= 100 \left(0.0490381\right)
\]
\[
= 4.90381
\]

Compute \( \frac{1}{d^2} \):
\[
\frac{0.0538476}{4.90381} \approx 0.010980
\]

Finally, compute \( d \):
\[
d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.010980}} \approx 9.54 \text{ Å}
\]

The interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \boxed{9.54} Angstroms.

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Hmm, let me recall what I know about crystal structures and interplanar distances.

First, the interplanar distance, often denoted as d_{hkl}, is the distance between consecutive parallel planes with Miller indices (hkl). For different crystal systems, the formula to calculate this distance varies because of the different lattice parameters and angles involved. Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of Bravais lattice, I need to use the specific formula for the rhombohedral system.

But wait, what exactly defines a rhombohedral crystal? The rhombohedral system is a subset of the hexagonal system, but it can also be considered as a trigonal system. It has lattice parameters where all three axes are of equal length (a = b = c), and all three interaxial angles are equal (α = β = γ), but those angles are not 90 degrees. In this case, the angles are all 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So here, the interatomic distance is the edge length of the rhombohedron, right? So the lattice constants a, b, c are all 10 Angstroms, and α = β = γ = 30°.

Now, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Hmm, I remember that for the hexagonal system, the formula is different, but for rhombohedral, maybe we need to use the formula that involves the lattice constants and the angles. Alternatively, sometimes people convert the rhombohedral system to a hexagonal coordinate system for easier calculations. Maybe that's a way to approach it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a direct formula for d_{hkl} in the rhombohedral system. Let me check my notes. Wait, the general formula for triclinic systems is the most complex, and since rhombohedral is a special case of the trigonal system, which is a subset of the triclinic with some symmetry, maybe I can use the triclinic formula here.

The formula for the interplanar distance in a triclinic crystal is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ h²a²b²c²(1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2cosα cosβ cosγ) + ... ]

Wait, no, that seems too complicated. Maybe a better way is to recall that in the rhombohedral system, the volume of the unit cell can be calculated using the formula:

V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

But I'm not sure. Let me confirm. The volume of a rhombohedron is given by V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α). Let's see, if α is 90 degrees, then cosα is 0, so V = a³ √(1 - 0 + 0) = a³, which is correct for a cubic system. If α is 60 degrees, cosα = 0.5, then V = a³ √(1 - 3*(0.25) + 2*(0.125)) = a³ √(1 - 0.75 + 0.25) = a³ √(0.5) ≈ a³ * 0.707, which seems reasonable. So this formula might be correct.

But how does this help me with the interplanar distance? Alternatively, maybe the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) / a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, since all the axes are equal and the angles are equal, maybe there's a simplified version. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps using the reciprocal lattice approach. For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters can be calculated, and then the interplanar distance is 1 / |G|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

a* = (b × c) / V

b* = (c × a) / V

c* = (a × b) / V

Where V is the volume of the unit cell.

But given that in the rhombohedral system, all the real space vectors a, b, c have the same length and the angles between them are all α. Then, the reciprocal lattice vectors would also form a rhombohedral lattice, but with different angles and lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the reciprocal lattice parameters in terms of the real lattice parameters. For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters a*, b*, c* can be found. Since the system is rhombohedral, the reciprocal lattice will also be rhombohedral with angles α* and lattice constants a*.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the interplanar distance in terms of the real space lattice parameters. Let me think.

The general formula for the interplanar distance in any crystal system is:

1/d² = (h a*)^2 + (k b*)^2 + (l c*)^2 + 2hk a* b* cosγ* + 2kl b* c* cosα* + 2lh c* a* cosβ*

But this is in terms of the reciprocal lattice parameters. So if I can compute the reciprocal lattice parameters, then I can compute d_{hkl}.

But to compute the reciprocal lattice parameters, I need to find a*, b*, c* and the angles between them. For a rhombohedral system, since the direct lattice has a = b = c and α = β = γ, then the reciprocal lattice will also have a* = b* = c* and angles α* = β* = γ*. Let's try to compute a*.

The volume of the unit cell V is given by:

V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

So then, the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vectors is:

a* = |b × c| / V

Since in the direct lattice, the vectors a, b, c have magnitude a, and the angle between any two is α. The cross product |b × c| is |b||c|sinα = a² sinα. The direction of b × c is perpendicular to both b and c, but the magnitude is a² sinα. Therefore, |b × c| = a² sinα. Then, a* = (a² sinα) / V.

But V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α), so:

a* = (a² sinα) / [a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)] = (sinα) / [a √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]

Similarly, since the system is rhombohedral, all reciprocal lattice vectors will have the same magnitude, so a* = b* = c*.

Now, the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors, say α*, can be found using the formula:

cosα* = [cosβ cosγ - cosα] / (sinβ sinγ)

But in the direct lattice, α = β = γ, so:

cosα* = [cosα cosα - cosα] / (sinα sinα) = [cos²α - cosα] / sin²α

Hmm, let's compute this. Let's plug in α = 30°, so cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, sinα = 1/2.

Then, cosα* = [ ( (√3/2)^2 - √3/2 ) ] / ( (1/2)^2 ) = [ (3/4 - √3/2 ) ] / (1/4 ) = 3/4 - √3/2 multiplied by 4.

So cosα* = 3 - 2√3 ≈ 3 - 3.464 ≈ -0.464. Therefore, α* = arccos(-0.464) ≈ 117.7 degrees.

But maybe I don't need the angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors. Instead, I need to compute the reciprocal lattice parameters to find 1/d².

But let's get back to the formula for 1/d². For the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1. So:

1/d² = (1² a*² + 1² b*² + 1² c*²) + 2(1*1 a* b* cosγ* + 1*1 b* c* cosα* + 1*1 c* a* cosβ* )

But since it's rhombohedral, a* = b* = c* and α* = β* = γ*, so:

1/d² = 3 a*² + 6 a*² cosα* = 3 a*² (1 + 2 cosα* )

But we have a* = (sinα) / [a √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]

So let's compute a* first. Given α = 30°, a = 10 Angstroms.

Compute the denominator: √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

First, compute cosα = cos30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.866

cos²α = (3/4) ≈ 0.75

cos³α = (3√3)/8 ≈ 0.6495

So, 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) = 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 1 - 2.25 is -1.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

Therefore, √0.049 ≈ 0.2217

So denominator is a * √(0.049) ≈ 10 * 0.2217 ≈ 2.217 Angstroms^{-1} ?

Wait, no. Wait, the denominator in the expression for a* is [a √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)].

So that's 10 Angstroms * 0.2217 ≈ 2.217 Angstroms.

Then, a* = sinα / denominator.

sinα = sin30° = 0.5

Therefore, a* = 0.5 / 2.217 ≈ 0.2255 Angstroms^{-1}

So a* ≈ 0.2255 Å^{-1}

Then, we have 1/d² = 3 a*² (1 + 2 cosα* )

Earlier, we found cosα* ≈ -0.464

So 1 + 2*(-0.464) = 1 - 0.928 = 0.072

Therefore, 1/d² = 3*(0.2255)^2 * 0.072

First compute (0.2255)^2 ≈ 0.0508

Then, 3*0.0508 ≈ 0.1524

Multiply by 0.072: 0.1524 * 0.072 ≈ 0.01097

Therefore, 1/d² ≈ 0.01097 Å^{-2}

So d ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.01097) ≈ 1 / 0.1048 ≈ 9.54 Angstroms

Wait, but the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, so getting an interplanar distance of ~9.54 Å seems a bit counterintuitive. Is that possible? Because the interplanar distance in a cubic system for (111) is a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å for a=10 Å. But here, with angles of 30°, the spacing is larger? Hmm, maybe. Let me check if my calculations are correct.

Wait, let's verify the calculation step by step.

First, compute the volume V:

V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

Given a = 10 Å, α = 30°, so:

Compute inside the square root:

1 - 3*(√3/2)^2 + 2*(√3/2)^3

First, (√3/2)^2 = 3/4, so 3*(3/4) = 9/4

(√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8, so 2*(3√3)/8 = (3√3)/4 ≈ 1.299

So, 1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4 ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049, which is correct.

So √0.049 ≈ 0.2217, so V = 10³ * 0.2217 ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³

Then, reciprocal lattice parameter a*:

a* = |b × c| / V

But |b × c| = a² sinα = 10² * sin30° = 100 * 0.5 = 50 Å²

Therefore, a* = 50 / 221.7 ≈ 0.2255 Å^{-1}, which matches the previous result.

Then, the angle α* in reciprocal space:

cosα* = [cos²α - cosα] / sin²α

Plugging in cosα = √3/2, sinα = 1/2:

cosα* = [ (3/4) - (√3/2) ] / (1/4 ) = (3/4 - √3/2) * 4 = 3 - 2√3 ≈ 3 - 3.464 ≈ -0.464, so α* ≈ 117.7°, as before.

Then, 1/d² = 3a*²(1 + 2cosα* )

Compute 3*(0.2255)^2*(1 + 2*(-0.464)) = 3*(0.0508)*(0.072) ≈ 0.01097

Thus, d ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.01097) ≈ 9.54 Å

Hmm, but wait, in a cubic system, the (111) planes are spaced by a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å for a=10 Å. Here, with the angles being 30°, which is more "squashed", the interplanar distance is larger? That seems plausible because the planes might be further apart if the unit cell is squashed. But let's check with another approach.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the interplanar distance in the rhombohedral system directly. Let me see if I can find such a formula.

Wait, here's another approach. In a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) can be calculated using:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( A )

Where A = h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh)cosα ) / (1 + 2cosα - 3cos²α )

Wait, not sure. Let me check.

Alternatively, found in some references, the formula for interplanar distance in a trigonal (rhombohedral) system is:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]

Let me test this formula. Plugging in h = k = l = 1, α = 30°, a = 10 Å.

First, compute numerator:

(1 + 1 + 1) sin²30° + 2(1 + 1 + 1)(cos²30° - cos30°)

= 3*(0.25) + 2*3*( (0.75) - (√3/2) )

= 0.75 + 6*(0.75 - 0.866)

= 0.75 + 6*(-0.116)

= 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054

Denominator:

a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α ) = 100*(0.049) ≈ 4.9

Therefore, 1/d² = 0.054 / 4.9 ≈ 0.01102

So d ≈ 1 / sqrt(0.01102) ≈ 9.54 Å, which matches the previous result. So this seems to confirm the answer.

Therefore, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane is approximately 9.54 Angstroms.

But let me check once more. If all the angles are 30°, which is quite a narrow angle, the unit cell is very rhombohedral, not cubic. The (111) planes in this case might be oriented such that the spacing is larger than in the cubic case. Alternatively, maybe in some orientation, but the calculation seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in assuming the interatomic distance is the edge length a. The problem states "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". In a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance could refer to the nearest neighbor distance, which is along the edges of the rhombohedron, so that would be the edge length a. Therefore, a = 10 Å. So that part is correct.

Therefore, after verifying with two different methods (reciprocal lattice approach and direct formula), the result is approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Rounding to two decimal places, maybe 9.5 Å. But let's see if the exact value can be expressed more neatly.

Wait, let's compute it more precisely. Let's go back to the numerator and denominator.

First, compute the numerator in the formula:

Numerator = (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα)

With h = k = l = 1, α = 30°.

Numerator = 3*(sin²30°) + 6*(cos²30° - cos30°)

sin²30° = 0.25

cos²30° = 0.75

cos30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660254

So:

Numerator = 3*(0.25) + 6*(0.75 - 0.8660254)

= 0.75 + 6*(-0.1160254)

= 0.75 - 0.6961524

= 0.0538476

Denominator = a²*(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) = 100*(1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*( (√3)/2 )³ )

Compute cos³α = (√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8 ≈ 0.64951905

So:

Denominator = 100*(1 - 2.25 + 2*0.64951905 )

= 100*( -1.25 + 1.2990381 )

= 100*(0.0490381 )

≈ 4.90381

Therefore, 1/d² = 0.0538476 / 4.90381 ≈ 0.010980

Thus, d = 1 / sqrt(0.010980) ≈ 1 / 0.1048 ≈ 9.54 Å

So precisely, approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Depending on the required precision, maybe we can write it as 9.5 Å or 9.54 Å. But let's see if this exact expression can be simplified.

Alternatively, since all steps were exact until the numerical calculation, perhaps we can express the answer symbolically.

Let me attempt to write the exact expression.

Numerator:

3*(1/4) + 6*(3/4 - √3/2 ) = 3/4 + 6*( (3 - 2√3)/4 ) = 3/4 + (18 - 12√3)/4 = (3 + 18 - 12√3)/4 = (21 - 12√3)/4

Denominator:

100*(1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3)/8 ) = 100*(1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4 ) = 100*( (4/4 - 9/4) + (3√3)/4 ) = 100*( (-5/4 + 3√3/4 ) ) = 100*( (-5 + 3√3)/4 ) = 25*(-5 + 3√3 )

Therefore, 1/d² = [ (21 - 12√3)/4 ] / [25*(-5 + 3√3 ) ] = (21 - 12√3) / [100*(-5 + 3√3 ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-1):

= ( -21 + 12√3 ) / [100*(5 - 3√3 ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by (5 + 3√3 ) to rationalize the denominator:

Numerator: (-21 + 12√3)(5 + 3√3 )

= -21*5 + (-21)(3√3 ) + 12√3 *5 + 12√3 *3√3

= -105 - 63√3 + 60√3 + 36*3

= -105 - 3√3 + 108

= 3 - 3√3

Denominator: 100*(5 - 3√3 )(5 + 3√3 ) = 100*(25 - 27) = 100*(-2) = -200

Therefore, 1/d² = (3 - 3√3 ) / (-200 ) = (3(1 - √3 )) / (-200 ) = ( -3(1 - √3 ) ) / 200 = 3(√3 -1 ) / 200

Thus, 1/d² = 3(√3 -1 ) / 200

Therefore, d² = 200 / [3(√3 -1 ) ] = 200 / [3(√3 -1 ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by (√3 +1 ):

d² = 200(√3 +1 ) / [3( (√3 -1 )(√3 +1 ) ) ] = 200(√3 +1 ) / [3(3 -1 ) ] = 200(√3 +1 ) / 6 = (100/3)(√3 +1 )

Therefore, d = sqrt( (100/3)(√3 +1 ) ) = (10)/sqrt(3) * sqrt(√3 +1 )

Hmm, not sure if this simplifies further, but numerically:

sqrt( (100/3)(√3 +1 ) ) ≈ sqrt( (100/3)(1.732 +1 ) ) ≈ sqrt( (100/3)(2.732 ) ) ≈ sqrt( 91.0667 ) ≈ 9.54 Å

So the exact expression is d = 10 * sqrt( (√3 +1 ) / 3 )

But perhaps that's not necessary. The numerical answer is approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Since the problem might expect an exact value or a simplified radical form, but given the angles and the parameters, it's likely they expect the numerical value.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. If the crystal is rhombohedral, the (111) plane is perpendicular to the body diagonal of the rhombohedron. The interplanar distance would then be the distance from the origin to the plane (111), which in the rhombohedral lattice can be calculated using the formula for the distance from the origin to the plane in a non-orthogonal coordinate system.

In general, the distance from the origin to the plane defined by ax + by + cz = d is |d| / sqrt(a² + b² + c² + ...), but in non-orthogonal coordinates, the formula is different.

Alternatively, in a rhombohedral lattice, the distance between consecutive (111) planes can be found by projecting the basis vector onto the direction perpendicular to the (111) plane.

The direction perpendicular to the (111) plane is along the vector [111] in reciprocal space. The length of this vector in reciprocal space is |G|, and the interplanar distance is 1 / |G|.

Wait, this might be another way to think about it. If the reciprocal lattice vector G corresponding to (111) has magnitude |G|, then d = 1 / |G|.

Earlier, we calculated |G| as sqrt(0.01097) ≈ 0.1048 Å^{-1}, so d ≈ 9.54 Å, which matches.

Alternatively, since in real space the vector [111] is the body diagonal of the rhombohedron. The length of the body diagonal in a rhombohedron can be calculated, but the interplanar distance is not the same as the body diagonal length. Wait, the body diagonal length would be the distance from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1), which in a rhombohedral lattice with edge length a and angle α is given by:

|R| = a * sqrt(3 + 6cosα )

Wait, let's confirm. The vector from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) in the rhombohedral lattice is a + b + c. The magnitude squared is (a + b + c)·(a + b + c) = |a|² + |b|² + |c|² + 2a·b + 2a·c + 2b·c

Since |a| = |b| = |c| = a, and a·b = a² cosα, etc. So:

|R|² = 3a² + 6a² cosα

Therefore, |R| = a sqrt(3 + 6cosα )

For α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.866

So |R| = 10 * sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2 )) = 10 * sqrt(3 + 3√3 ) ≈ 10 * sqrt(3 + 5.196) ≈ 10 * sqrt(8.196) ≈ 10 * 2.863 ≈ 28.63 Å

But this is the length of the body diagonal. However, the interplanar distance is not the same as the body diagonal. The interplanar distance is the distance between consecutive (111) planes, which in a crystal lattice can be found by taking the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector, which we already did.

Alternatively, if we consider that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is equal to the length of the vector from the origin to the plane (hkl) divided by the number of planes. But I think this is equivalent to the reciprocal lattice method.

But given that multiple methods lead to the same answer of approximately 9.54 Å, I think this is the correct result. Therefore, the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.54 Angstroms.

Since the problem gives angles as 30°, which are exact, and the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, which is likely exact, the answer should be presented as a decimal, perhaps rounded to two decimal places. Alternatively, if an exact form is required, but given the complexity of the exact expression, the decimal is probably acceptable.

**Final Answer**
The interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \boxed{9.54} Angstroms.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Hmm, let me recall what I know about crystal structures and interplanar distances.

First, the interplanar distance, often denoted as d_{hkl}, is the distance between consecutive parallel planes with Miller indices (hkl). For different crystal systems, the formula to calculate this distance varies because of the different lattice parameters and angles involved. Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of Bravais lattice, I need to use the specific formula for the rhombohedral system.

But wait, what exactly defines a rhombohedral crystal? The rhombohedral system is a subset of the hexagonal system, but it can also be considered as a trigonal system. It has lattice parameters where all three axes are of equal length (a = b = c), and all three interaxial angles are equal (α = β = γ), but those angles are not 90 degrees. In this case, the angles are all 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. So here, the interatomic distance is the edge length of the rhombohedron, right? So the lattice constants a, b, c are all 10 Angstroms, and α = β = γ = 30°.

Now, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Hmm, I remember that for the hexagonal system, the formula is different, but for rhombohedral, maybe we need to use the formula that involves the lattice constants and the angles. Alternatively, sometimes people convert the rhombohedral system to a hexagonal coordinate system for easier calculations. Maybe that's a way to approach it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a direct formula for d_{hkl} in the rhombohedral system. Let me check my notes. Wait, the general formula for triclinic systems is the most complex, and since rhombohedral is a special case of the trigonal system, which is a subset of the triclinic with some symmetry, maybe I can use the triclinic formula here.

The formula for the interplanar distance in a triclinic crystal is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ h²a²b²c²(1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2cosα cosβ cosγ) + ... ]

Wait, no, that seems too complicated. Maybe a better way is to recall that in the rhombohedral system, the volume of the unit cell can be calculated using the formula:

V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

But I'm not sure. Let me confirm. The volume of a rhombohedron is given by V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α). Let's see, if α is 90 degrees, then cosα is 0, so V = a³ √(1 - 0 + 0) = a³, which is correct for a cubic system. If α is 60 degrees, cosα = 0.5, then V = a³ √(1 - 3*(0.25) + 2*(0.125)) = a³ √(1 - 0.75 + 0.25) = a³ √(0.5) ≈ a³ * 0.707, which seems reasonable. So this formula might be correct.

But how does this help me with the interplanar distance? Alternatively, maybe the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) / a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, since all the axes are equal and the angles are equal, maybe there's a simplified version. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps using the reciprocal lattice approach. For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters can be calculated, and then the interplanar distance is 1 / |G|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

a* = (b × c) / V

b* = (c × a) / V

c* = (a × b) / V

Where V is the volume of the unit cell.

But given that in the rhombohedral system, all the real space vectors a, b, c have the same length and the angles between them are all α. Then, the reciprocal lattice vectors would also form a rhombohedral lattice, but with different angles and lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the reciprocal lattice parameters in terms of the real lattice parameters. For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters a*, b*, c* can be found. Since the system is rhombohedral, the reciprocal lattice will also be rhombohedral with angles α* and lattice constants a*.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the interplanar distance in terms of the real space lattice parameters. Let me think.

The general formula for the interplanar distance in any crystal syste

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The crystal has an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms, with all angles α, β, γ equal to 30 degrees. Let me consider what this means for calculating the interplanar distance.

The interplanar distance (d_{hkl}) represents the spacing between consecutive parallel planes with Miller indices (hkl). For rhombohedral crystals, which are a type of Bravais lattice, I need to use a formula specific to this crystal system.

A rhombohedral crystal is characterized by having all three axes of equal length (a = b = c) and all three interaxial angles equal (α = β = γ), but not 90 degrees. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. I can assume the interatomic distance corresponds to the edge length of the rhombohedron, meaning the lattice constants a, b, c are all 10 Angstroms.

To calculate the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system, I could use several approaches. One possibility is to use the formula for a triclinic system and simplify it for the rhombohedral case, but that seems unnecessarily complex.

For rhombohedral crystals, the volume of the unit cell can be calculated using:
V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

I can verify this formula works correctly: for α = 90° (cubic case), V = a³, and for α =
60°, V ≈ 0.707a³, which seems reasonable.

However, I need to relate this to the interplanar distance. One potential formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:
1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) / a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

Alternatively, I could use the reciprocal lattice approach. Since this is a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are:
a* = (b × c) / V
b* = (c × a) / V
c* = (a × b) / V

Since all real space vectors have equal length and equal angles between them, the reciprocal lattice would also be rhombohedral, but with different angles and lengths.

The interplanar distance could then be calculated as 1/|G|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (111) plane.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to calculate the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I'm given that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Let me recall some details about crystal structures and interplanar distances.

The interplanar distance, often denoted as d_{hkl}, represents the distance between successive parallel planes with Miller indices (hkl). The formula for calculating this distance differs across crystal systems because of variations in lattice parameters and angles. For a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of Bravais lattice, a specific formula for this system is required.

Let me consider the characteristics of a rhombohedral crystal. It is a subset of the hexagonal system, though it can also be viewed as a trigonal system. This structure has equal axes (a = b = c) and identical interaxial angles (α = β = γ), which are not equal to 90 degrees. In this example, all angles are 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, meaning the edge length of the rhombohedron is 10 Angstroms, with α = β = γ = 30°.

Next, thinking of the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system, there are various methods, including possibly converting the system to hexagonal coordinates for easier calculations. Alternatively, there might be a direct formula for d_{hkl} specific to the rhombohedral system. Reviewing my notes, the triclinic system's general formula is quite complex, and since the rhombohedral is a specialized case under the trigonal system, deriving from triclinic symmetry, I might be able to adapt the triclinic formula.

For a triclinic crystal, the interplanar distance formula is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ h²a²b²c²(1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2cosα cosβ cosγ) + ... ]

However, this seems overly complex. Another route is through the volume of a rhombohedron, calculated by:

V = a³√(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α).

Checking this formula, if α is 90 degrees, V = a³, which fits the cubic system. For α at 60 degrees with cosα = 0.5, it reduces to V = a³ √(0.5) ≈ a³ * 0.707, appearing reasonable. This validates the formula's accuracy.

Still seeking the interplanar distance relation, a simpler expression might be:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) / a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α).

This seems intricate, but with uniform axes and angles, a simplified version could exist. Exploring another method, I consider using the reciprocal lattice. In a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal vectors can be obtained with:

a* = (b × c) / V

b* = (c × a) / V

c* = (a × b) / V

Given that all real-space vectors have the same length and angles α, the reciprocal lattice would also maintain a rhombohedral form with altered angles and lengths. Potentially, a formula translates the reciprocal lattice parameters into real lattice terms, defining angles α* and constants a*.

Assessing all options, I'll continue to derive the interplanar distance based on the real space lattice parameters.

However, calculating this might get too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the interplanar spacing in the rhombohedral system. After some research, I found that in the rhombohedral system, the formula for d_{hkl} is:\n\n1/d² = [(h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα)] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]\n\nBut I need to confirm if this is correct. Let me check the units. The left side is 1/d², which has units of 1/length². The right side numerator has terms with sin²α (dimensionless) and (cos²α - cosα) (dimensionless), multiplied by (h² + k² + l²) and 2(hk + kl + lh), which are dimensionless since h, k, l are integers. Then the denominator is a² times (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α), which is dimensionless. So overall, it\'s 1/a², which makes sense. So the formula is dimensionally consistent.\n\nGiven that, let\'s plug in the values. The problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which is the edge length a. So a = 10 Å. The angles α = β = γ = 30°, so α = 30°. The Miller indices are (111), so h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n1/d² = [(1² + 1² + 1²) sin²30° + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)(cos²30° - cos30°)] / [10²(1 - 3cos²30° + 2cos³30°)]\n\nLet\'s compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\nFirst term: (1 + 1 + 1) sin²30° = 3 * (sin30°)^2\n\nsin30° = 0.5, so sin²30° = 0.25. Hence, first term = 3 * 0.25 = 0.75\n\nSecond term: 2*(1 + 1 + 1)*(cos²30° - cos30°) = 2*3*(cos²30° - cos30°)\n\ncos30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\ncos²30° = (√3/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75\n\nThus, cos²30° - cos30° = 0.75 - 0.8660 ≈ -0.1160\n\nHence, second term = 2*3*(-0.1160) ≈ 6*(-0.1160) ≈ -0.696\n\nTherefore, numerator = 0.75 + (-0.696) ≈ 0.054\n\nNow, compute the denominator:\n\n10²*(1 - 3cos²30° + 2cos³30°)\n\nFirst, compute 1 - 3cos²30° + 2cos³30°\n\nWe already have cos²30° = 0.75 and cos³30° = (√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8 ≈ 0.6495\n\nSo:\n\n1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) = 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ (1 - 2.25) + 1.299 = (-1.25) + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nTherefore, denominator = 100 * 0.049 ≈ 4.9\n\nTherefore, 1/d² ≈ 0.054 / 4.9 ≈ 0.01102\n\nThen, d² ≈ 1 / 0.01102 ≈ 90.74\n\nTherefore, d ≈ sqrt(90.74) ≈ 9.526 Angstroms\n\nWait, but this seems a bit counterintuitive. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and the interplanar distance for (111) is about 9.5? Hmm, depending on the angles, maybe. Let me check if the calculation steps are correct.\n\nFirst, let\'s verify the formula again. The formula:\n\n1/d² = [(h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα)] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]\n\nIs this the correct formula for the rhombohedral system? I need to be careful here because different sources might present different formulas depending on the coordinate system used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the general triclinic formula. For a triclinic system, the formula for 1/d² is:\n\n1/d² = (1 / V²) [ S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2 S12 h k + 2 S23 k l + 2 S13 h l ]\n\nWhere S11, S22, S33, S12, S23, S13 are the elements of the metric tensor. For a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c and α = β = γ, the metric tensor will have all diagonal elements equal and all off-diagonal elements equal.\n\nThe metric tensor G for real space lattice vectors is:\n\nG = [ a²   a² cosγ   a² cosβ\n      a² cosγ   a²   a² cosα\n      a² cosβ   a² cosα   a² ]\n\nBut in the rhombohedral system, α = β = γ, so:\n\nG = [ a²   a² cosα   a² cosα\n      a² cosα   a²   a² cosα\n      a² cosα   a² cosα   a² ]\n\nThen, the metric tensor in reciprocal space is G*, which is the inverse of G. The elements of G* can be calculated, but perhaps this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for triclinic:\n\nThe volume V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α). Wait, we had that earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the inverse of the metric tensor (reciprocal metric tensor) can be used to compute 1/d².\n\nBut maybe another approach. Let\'s consider the (111) planes. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} can be calculated as the distance from the origin to the plane (111). In vector terms, the plane (hkl) is defined by the equation hx + ky + lz = n, where n is an integer. The distance from the origin to the plane is |n| / sqrt(h² + k² + l²) in a cubic system, but in non-cubic systems, it\'s more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the distance can be computed using the formula:\n\nd_{hkl} = 1 / |G_{hkl}|\n\nWhere G_{hkl} is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane. The magnitude of G is |G| = 1/d.\n\nBut to compute G, we need the reciprocal lattice vectors. Let\'s try this approach.\n\nIn real space, the primitive vectors of the rhombohedral lattice can be written as:\n\na1 = a [1, 0, 0]\n\na2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]\n\na3 = a [cosα, cosα cotθ, something]\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me recall the standard rhombohedral primitive vectors.\n\nIn a rhombohedral lattice, the primitive vectors can be considered as vectors of equal length a, with equal angles α between each pair. The coordinates can be written in terms of a Cartesian system, but it\'s a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors b1, b2, b3 satisfy:\n\nb1 = 2π (a2 × a3) / V\n\nb2 = 2π (a3 × a1) / V\n\nb3 = 2π (a1 × a2) / V\n\nWhere V is the volume of the real space unit cell.\n\nGiven that, let\'s compute V first. As before, V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α). For α = 30°, let\'s compute this term.\n\nFirst, compute 1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α:\n\ncosα = cos30° ≈ 0.8660\n\ncos²α ≈ 0.75\n\ncos³α ≈ 0.6495\n\nSo:\n\n1 - 3*0.75 + 2*0.6495 = 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 1 - 2.25 = -1.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nThus, V = a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a³ * 0.2217\n\nGiven a = 10 Å, V ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³\n\nNow, compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. Let\'s first compute a2 × a3.\n\nBut to compute the cross product, we need the actual components of a2 and a3. Let\'s define the real space vectors.\n\nLet me choose a coordinate system where a1 is along the x-axis. Then:\n\na1 = a [1, 0, 0]\n\na2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]\n\na3 = a [cosα, cosα cotθ, something]. Wait, actually, in a rhombohedral system, all three vectors have the same length and the angle between any two is α. So, the third vector a3 can be written in terms of components. Let me recall that in a rhombohedral lattice, the vectors are such that each has equal length and equal angles between them.\n\nTo define a3, since the angle between a1 and a3 is α, and the angle between a2 and a3 is also α. Let me use spherical coordinates. Let’s denote the components of a3 as (a cosφ, a sinφ cosθ, a sinφ sinθ). The angle between a1 and a3 is α, so the dot product between a1 and a3 is a² cosα = a * a * cosφ. Therefore, cosφ = cosα => φ = α.\n\nSimilarly, the angle between a2 and a3 is α. The dot product between a2 and a3 is a² cosα = (a1 • a2) * (a1 • a3) + ... Wait, maybe it\'s easier to write the components.\n\nGiven a1 = (a, 0, 0)\n\na2 = (a cosα, a sinα, 0)\n\nNow, let a3 = (a cosα, a sinα cosβ, a sinα sinβ)\n\nWe need the angle between a2 and a3 to be α. Let\'s compute the dot product:\n\na2 • a3 = a² [cosα * cosα + sinα * sinα cosβ + 0 * sinα sinβ] = a² [cos²α + sin²α cosβ]\n\nThe magnitude of a2 and a3 is a, so the dot product is a² cosα. Therefore:\n\ncos²α + sin²α cosβ = cosα\n\nSolving for cosβ:\n\nsin²α cosβ = cosα - cos²α\n\ncosβ = (cosα - cos²α) / sin²α\n\nBut sin²α = 1 - cos²α, so:\n\ncosβ = [cosα (1 - cosα)] / (1 - cos²α) = [cosα (1 - cosα)] / [(1 - cosα)(1 + cosα)] ) = cosα / (1 + cosα)\n\nTherefore, cosβ = cosα / (1 + cosα)\n\nFor α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\ncosβ = (√3/2) / (1 + √3/2) = (√3/2) / ( (2 + √3)/2 ) = √3 / (2 + √3)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):\n\n√3 (2 - √3) / [ (2 + √3)(2 - √3) ] = [2√3 - 3] / (4 - 3) = 2√3 - 3 ≈ 2*1.732 - 3 ≈ 3.464 - 3 ≈ 0.464\n\nTherefore, β ≈ cos⁻¹(0.464) ≈ 62.3 degrees\n\nBut this seems complicated, perhaps there\'s a better way. Alternatively, maybe the third vector a3 can be written as (a cosα, a cosα, a cosα), but normalized? No, because then the angle between a1 and a3 would be arccos( (a cosα)/a ) = α, which is correct, but the magnitude of a3 would be a sqrt(cos²α + cos²α + cos²α) = a sqrt(3 cos²α) = a cosα sqrt(3). But we need the magnitude to be a, so that would require cosα sqrt(3) = 1 => cosα = 1/√3 ≈ 54.7 degrees, which is not our case here. So that approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard way to define a rhombohedral lattice is with vectors:\n\na1 = a (1, 0, 0)\n\na2 = a (m, n, 0)\n\na3 = a (p, q, r)\n\nSuch that the angles between any two vectors are α. But this might require solving a system of equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that in a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be expressed in terms of the real space vectors. However, this is getting too involved. Maybe I should stick to the initial formula I used for 1/d² and check if the calculation was correct.\n\nWait, when I calculated 1/d² ≈ 0.01102 Å⁻², leading to d ≈ 9.526 Å. But the edge length is 10 Å, so this seems plausible. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, in a cubic system (where α = 90°), the interplanar distance for (111) would be a / sqrt(1² + 1² + 1²) = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å for a = 10 Å. But in this case, with α = 30°, the interplanar distance is larger, which makes sense because the planes are more closely packed? Wait, no, wait. If the angles are smaller (30° instead of 90°), the structure is more compressed along the axes, so maybe the interplanar distance could be larger or smaller depending on the orientation.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s consider a hexagonal system. If the crystal were hexagonal, the (001) planes would have a spacing equal to the c-axis length. But we have a rhombohedral system here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Since the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude is |G| = 2π/d, and d = 2π/|G|.\n\nBut to compute |G| for the (111) reflection, we need to express G as h b1 + k b2 + l b3, where b1, b2, b3 are the reciprocal lattice vectors.\n\nGiven that real space vectors are a1, a2, a3, the reciprocal vectors are defined as:\n\nb1 = 2π (a2 × a3) / V\n\nSimilarly for b2 and b3.\n\nBut since I don\'t have the exact components of a2 and a3, this might be hard. Alternatively, note that for a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, with angles α* and lattice constants a*, where:\n\na* = (2π / a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)\n\nBut I need to verify this. Alternatively, the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vectors can be found.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the metric tensor.\n\nIn real space, the metric tensor G is:\n\nG_ij = a_i • a_j\n\nGiven that all |a_i| = a and the angles between any two a_i and a_j is α, then:\n\nG = a² [ 1      cosα   cosα\n          cosα   1      cosα\n          cosα   cosα    1 ]\n\nThe inverse of this matrix, G⁻¹, is the reciprocal metric tensor. The elements of G⁻¹ can be calculated using the formula for the inverse of a 3x3 matrix, but it\'s a bit tedious.\n\nAlternatively, since the metric tensor is a 3x3 matrix with diagonal elements a² and off-diagonal elements a² cosα, we can use the formula for the inverse of such a matrix. For a matrix of the form:\n\n[ b   c   c\n  c   b   c\n  c   c   b ]\n\nThe inverse is (1/det) * [ ... ].\n\nBut let me compute the determinant first. The determinant of G is:\n\n|G| = a² [ a² (a² - a² cos²α) - a² cosα (a² cosα - a² cos²α) + a² cosα (a² cos²α - a² cosα) ]\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, use the fact that the determinant of a 3x3 matrix with diagonal entries d and off-diagonal entries o is:\n\ndet = (d - o)^2 (d + 2o)\n\nSo here, d = a², o = a² cosα. Then,\n\ndet = (a² - a² cosα)^2 (a² + 2a² cosα) = a^6 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα)\n\nTherefore, det = a^6 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα)\n\nThen, the inverse matrix G⁻¹ will have elements:\n\nFor diagonal entries: [ (d + o) ] / det ?\n\nWait, no. The inverse of a matrix with diagonal entries d and off-diagonal entries o is a matrix with diagonal entries (d + (n-2)o) / det and off-diagonal entries -o / det for n x n matrices. But for a 3x3 matrix, the formula is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for each element:\n\nG⁻¹_ij = (G⁻¹)_ij = (1/det) * [ cofactor of G_ij ]\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Alternatively, note that for the metric tensor G, the reciprocal metric tensor G⁻¹ is related to the reciprocal lattice vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since calculating G⁻¹ is complicated, maybe use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the metric tensor.\n\nThe square of the interplanar distance is given by:\n\nd² = 1 / ( h² G⁻¹_11 + k² G⁻¹_22 + l² G⁻¹_33 + 2hk G⁻¹_12 + 2kl G⁻¹_23 + 2lh G⁻¹_13 )\n\nBut since we have a rhombohedral system, all the diagonal elements of G⁻¹ are equal, and all the off-diagonal elements are equal. Let\'s denote G⁻¹_11 = G⁻¹_22 = G⁻¹_33 = A, and G⁻¹_12 = G⁻¹_13 = G⁻¹_23 = B.\n\nTherefore,\n\nd² = 1 / [ A(h² + k² + l²) + 2B(hk + kl + lh) ]\n\nSo we need to compute A and B.\n\nGiven that G is:\n\n[ a²     a² cosα   a² cosα\n  a² cosα   a²     a² cosα\n  a² cosα   a² cosα   a² ]\n\nThe inverse matrix G⁻¹ will have:\n\nA = [ a² (a² - a² cos²α) ] / det\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the inverse of a matrix with diagonal entries d and off-diagonal entries o. For a 3x3 matrix:\n\nThe inverse can be calculated as:\n\n(1/det) * [ (d^2 - o^2)      -o(d - o)       -o(d - o)\n             -o(d - o)       (d^2 - o^2)      -o(d - o)\n             -o(d - o)       -o(d - o)       (d^2 - o^2) ]\n\nBut I need to confirm this. Let me denote the matrix as M with diagonal elements d and off-diagonal elements o.\n\nThen, the inverse M⁻¹ is (1/det(M)) times the adjugate matrix. Let\'s compute det(M):\n\ndet(M) = d^3 + 2o^3 - 3d o^2\n\nFor our case, d = a², o = a² cosα.\n\ndet(G) = (a²)^3 + 2(a² cosα)^3 - 3(a²)(a² cosα)^2\n\n= a^6 [1 + 2cos³α - 3cos²α]\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, the elements of the adjugate matrix:\n\nThe diagonal entries are:\n\nFor the first diagonal element: determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1:\n\n| a²      a² cosα |\n| a² cosα   a²    |\n\n= a² * a² - (a² cosα)^2 = a^4 (1 - cos²α)\n\nSimilarly for the other diagonal entries.\n\nThe off-diagonal entries (for example, the element at (1,2)) is the cofactor, which is (-1)^{1+2} times the determinant of the submatrix:\n\n| a² cosα   a² cosα |\n| a² cosα   a²     |\n\n= - [ a² cosα * a² - (a² cosα)^2 ] = -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)\n\nSimilarly, all off-diagonal entries in the adjugate matrix are -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)\n\nTherefore, the adjugate matrix is:\n\n[ a^4(1 - cos²α)   -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)   -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)\n  -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)   a^4(1 - cos²α)   -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)\n  -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)   -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)   a^4(1 - cos²α) ]\n\nTherefore, the inverse matrix G⁻¹ = adjugate / det(G):\n\nG⁻¹_11 = [a^4(1 - cos²α)] / det(G)\n\nSimilarly for other diagonal elements.\n\nG⁻¹_12 = [ -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα) ] / det(G)\n\nSimilarly for other off-diagonal elements.\n\nBut det(G) = a^6 (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)\n\nTherefore:\n\nA = G⁻¹_11 = [a^4 (1 - cos²α)] / [a^6 (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)] = (1 - cos²α) / [a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]\n\nSimilarly,\n\nB = G⁻¹_12 = [ -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα) ] / [a^6 (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ] = -cosα (1 - cosα) / [a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the formula for d²:\n\nd² = 1 / [ A(h² + k² + l²) + 2B(hk + kl + lh) ]\n\nPlugging in A and B:\n\nd² = 1 / [ (1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²)/(a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)) + 2*(-cosα (1 - cosα))(hk + kl + lh)/(a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)) ]\n\nFactor out 1/(a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)):\n\nd² = 1 / [ { (1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²) - 2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh) } / (a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)) ]\n\nTherefore,\n\nd² = a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ (1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²) - 2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh) ]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ (1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²) - 2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh) ] )\n\nNow, let\'s plug in the values:\n\na = 10 Å\n\nα = 30°, so cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nh = k = l = 1\n\nFirst, compute the numerator inside the sqrt:\n\n1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )^3 = 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3)/8 = 1 - 2.25 + (3√3)/4 ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nDenominator inside the sqrt:\n\n(1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²) - 2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh)\n\nFirst, compute each part:\n\n1 - cos²α = sin²α = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 = 0.25\n\nh² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nSo first term: 0.25 * 3 = 0.75\n\nSecond term:\n\n2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh) = 2*(√3/2)*(1 - √3/2)*(3)\n\n= 2*(0.8660)*(1 - 0.8660)*3\n\n= 2*0.8660*0.1340*3 ≈ 2*0.8660*0.402 ≈ 2*0.348 ≈ 0.696\n\nBut since it\'s subtracted:\n\nDenominator = 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054\n\nTherefore,\n\nd = 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.907) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nWhich matches the previous result. Therefore, the interplanar distance d_{111} ≈ 9.52 Angstroms.\n\nBut let me check the exact calculation of 0.049 / 0.054. 0.049 / 0.054 is approximately 0.907, square root is approx 0.952, so 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å. So the answer is approximately 9.52 Angstroms.\n\nBut the question specifies a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Angstroms. Wait, in the rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance is the edge length a, which is the distance between adjacent atoms along the edges of the rhombohedron. So that would correspond to the lattice constant a = 10 Å. Therefore, our calculation seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a mistake in the formula. Let\'s check with α = 90°, which should reduce to the cubic system.\n\nIf α = 90°, then cosα = 0. Then,\n\nNumerator inside sqrt: 1 - 0 + 0 = 1\n\nDenominator inside sqrt: (1 - 0)(3) - 0 = 3\n\nTherefore, d = a sqrt(1/3) = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 10 / 1.732 ≈ 5.77 Å, which is correct for cubic (111) planes. So the formula works for α = 90°, which is a good check.\n\nFor α = 60°, which is a common angle in some crystals:\n\ncosα = 0.5\n\nNumerator: 1 - 3*(0.25) + 2*(0.125) = 1 - 0.75 + 0.25 = 0.5\n\nDenominator: (1 - 0.25)(3) - 2*(0.5)*(1 - 0.5)*(3) = 0.75*3 - 0.5*0.5*3 = 2.25 - 0.75 = 1.5\n\nThus, d = a sqrt(0.5 / 1.5) = a sqrt(1/3) ≈ a / 1.732, same as cubic. But for α = 60°, the structure is face-centered cubic or body-centered cubic? Not sure, but the formula gives the same result as cubic, which might not be accurate. Wait, maybe α = 60° in a rhombohedral lattice corresponds to a different crystal system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when α = 60°, the rhombohedral lattice is equivalent to a face-centered cubic lattice. In that case, the (111) interplanar distance would indeed be a / sqrt(3), since in FCC the (111) planes are close-packed. But in our calculation, even with α = 60°, we get the same result as cubic, which might indicate a limitation of the formula or my understanding.\n\nBut given that the formula works for α = 90°, and gives a reasonable value for α = 30°, and the steps have been double-checked, I think the answer of approximately 9.52 Å is correct.\n\nBut let\'s express it more precisely. Let\'s compute sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) exactly.\n\n0.049 / 0.054 = 49 / 54 ≈ 0.907407\n\nsqrt(49/54) = 7 / sqrt(54) ≈ 7 / 7.348 ≈ 0.952\n\nThus, d = 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nRounding to two decimal places, 9.52 Å. But since the given interatomic distance is 10 Å, which has two significant figures, perhaps we should round to two significant figures, giving 9.5 Å. However, 10 has two significant figures, and the angles are given as 30°, which is exact. But in crystallography, sometimes angles are considered exact, so maybe we can keep three significant figures. Alternatively, check if the exact value can be expressed in terms of radicals.\n\nAlternatively, compute the exact value using the exact terms.\n\nGiven α = 30°, cosα = √3/2, so:\n\nNumerator inside sqrt:\n\n1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )³ = 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3)/8 = 1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4\n\nConvert to quarters:\n\n= (4/4 - 9/4) + (3√3)/4 = (-5/4) + (3√3)/4 = ( -5 + 3√3 ) / 4\n\nDenominator inside sqrt:\n\n(1 - cos²α)(3) - 2cosα(1 - cosα)(3) = 3*(1 - 3/4) - 6*(√3/2)*(1 - √3/2) = 3*(1/4) - 6*(√3/2)*( (2 - √3)/2 )\n\n= 3/4 - 6*(√3*(2 - √3))/4 = 3/4 - (6√3*(2 - √3))/4\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 3/4 - (12√3 - 6*3)/4 = 3/4 - (12√3 - 18)/4 = [3 - 12√3 + 18] / 4 = (21 - 12√3)/4\n\nTherefore,\n\nd = 10 * sqrt( [ (-5 + 3√3)/4 ] / [ (21 - 12√3)/4 ] ) = 10 * sqrt( (-5 + 3√3) / (21 - 12√3) )\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator\'s denominator:\n\n( -5 + 3√3 ) / (21 - 12√3 ) * (21 + 12√3 ) / (21 + 12√3 )\n\nNumerator: (-5)(21) + (-5)(12√3) + 3√3(21) + 3√3(12√3)\n\n= -105 - 60√3 + 63√3 + 36*3\n\n= -105 - 60√3 + 63√3 + 108\n\n= ( -105 + 108 ) + ( -60√3 + 63√3 )\n\n= 3 + 3√3\n\nDenominator: (21)^2 - (12√3)^2 = 441 - 144*3 = 441 - 432 = 9\n\nTherefore, the fraction becomes (3 + 3√3)/9 = (1 + √3)/3\n\nThus,\n\nd = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )\n\nCompute sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )\n\nLet’s compute (1 + √3)/3 ≈ (1 + 1.732)/3 ≈ 2.732 / 3 ≈ 0.9107\n\nsqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954\n\nTherefore, d ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å\n\nThis is a more precise calculation, giving approximately 9.54 Å. However, considering significant figures, since the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms (one significant figure?), but angles are 30°, which is exact. Wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. If 10 is considered as two significant figures (with the decimal point implied), then the answer should be two significant figures, so 9.5 Å. However, if 10 is considered as one significant figure, it would be 10 Å, but that\'s unlikely in a crystallography context where parameters are usually known precisely. But the problem states "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom", without any decimal or uncertainty, which might imply one significant figure. However, in crystallography, lattice parameters are usually given with more precision, so maybe it\'s two significant figures. The angles are given as 30°, which is exact, so perhaps we can keep two decimal places in the answer.\n\nBut based on the exact expression:\n\nd = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ 10 * sqrt( (1 + 1.732)/3 ) ≈ 10 * sqrt(2.732 / 3) ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å\n\nSo approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Rounding to two decimal places, 9.54 Å, or to two significant figures, 9.5 Å.\n\nBut since the initial value is 10 Å (possibly two significant figures), angles are 30°, which is exact. Therefore, the answer should be 9.5 Å.\n\nHowever, in the initial calculation using the formula, we got approximately 9.52 Å, and with the exact calculation, 9.54 Å. The difference is due to rounding at various steps. To be precise, let\'s compute sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) more accurately.\n\nCompute √3 ≈ 1.7320508075688772\n\n1 + √3 ≈ 2.7320508075688772\n\nDivide by 3: 2.7320508075688772 / 3 ≈ 0.910683602522959\n\nSquare root: sqrt(0.910683602522959) ≈ 0.9542561953\n\nTherefore, d ≈ 10 * 0.9542561953 ≈ 9.542561953 Å\n\nSo approximately 9.54 Å. Depending on the required precision, this would be 9.5 Å or 9.54 Å. Since the problem doesn\'t specify, but in crystallography, interplanar distances are often given to two decimal places, but since the given interatomic distance is 10 Å (maybe only one decimal place?), it\'s a bit ambiguous. However, given that 10 could be considered as two significant figures (if the trailing zero is significant), but without a decimal, it\'s ambiguous. In many contexts, 10 would be one significant figure, but in scientific notation, 10. would be two. Since it\'s written as 10 Angstrom without a decimal, it\'s safer to assume one significant figure, but given that angles are 30°, which is exact, and the answer requires precision, maybe we should present it with two decimal places as 9.54 Å.\n\nHowever, in the initial step-by-step calculation, we got approximately 9.52 Å. The exact calculation gives 9.54 Å. The difference is due to rounding errors in the intermediate steps. The exact value is 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ 9.54 Å.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Since the problem gives angles in degrees, and interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, maybe the expected answer is simply using a simplified formula.\n\nWait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh)cosα )\n\nBut this is for cubic systems with a different angle? Wait, no, that formula is for cubic systems with a distortion. Wait, perhaps in the case of a rhombohedral lattice, if we consider the cubic axes but with a rhombohedral distortion, but I\'m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in some references, the formula for the interplanar spacing in the rhombohedral system is given by:\n\nd = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) )\n\nWhich is similar to the formula I used earlier. Wait, let\'s check.\n\nYes, in the earlier calculation, we had:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n\nBut the formula I just wrote is different. Let me see:\n\nIf d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) )\n\nThen,\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] / a²\n\nBut comparing with our previous result, this would mean that:\n\n[ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] / a² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n\nWhich would require:\n\n1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ]\n\nBut this is not generally true. Therefore, the formula I found in some references might be incorrect, or applicable under different conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is the one we derived using the metric tensor, which gave us d = a sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ (1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²) - 2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh) ] )\n\nWhich for h = k = l = 1 becomes:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ 3(1 - cos²α) - 6cosα(1 - cosα) ] )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n3(1 - cos²α) - 6cosα(1 - cosα) = 3(1 - cosα)(1 + cosα) - 6cosα(1 - cosα) = 3(1 - cosα)(1 + cosα - 2cosα ) = 3(1 - cosα)(1 - cosα) = 3(1 - cosα)^2\n\nTherefore,\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ 3(1 - cosα)^2 ] )\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = (1 - cosα)^2(1 + 2cosα)\n\nBecause:\n\n(1 - cosα)^2(1 + 2cosα) = (1 - 2cosα + cos²α)(1 + 2cosα) = 1*(1 + 2cosα) - 2cosα(1 + 2cosα) + cos²α(1 + 2cosα)\n\n= 1 + 2cosα - 2cosα - 4cos²α + cos²α + 2cos³α\n\n= 1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α\n\nYes, that\'s correct.\n\nTherefore,\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - cosα)^2(1 + 2cosα) / [ 3(1 - cosα)^2 ] ) = a sqrt( (1 + 2cosα)/3 )\n\nThus,\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 + 2cosα)/3 )\n\nWow, that\'s a much simpler formula! So for the (111) planes in a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance simplifies to:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 + 2cosα)/3 )\n\nThis is a elegant result. Let\'s verify this with our previous calculations.\n\nGiven a = 10 Å, α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nThen,\n\n(1 + 2cosα)/3 = (1 + 2*(√3/2))/3 = (1 + √3)/3 ≈ (1 + 1.732)/3 ≈ 2.732/3 ≈ 0.9107\n\nsqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954\n\nThus, d ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å\n\nWhich matches our previous exact calculation. This shows that the formula simplifies significantly for the (111) plane.\n\nTherefore, the general formula for the interplanar distance of (111) in a rhombohedral crystal is:\n\nd_{111} = a sqrt( (1 + 2cosα)/3 )\n\nThis is much easier to use and remember.\n\nGiven that, we can directly compute it:\n\nd = 10 Å * sqrt( (1 + 2*cos30°)/3 )\n\ncos30° = √3/2, so:\n\nd = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å\n\nTherefore, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstroms.\n\nThis simplified formula makes sense because for a cubic system (α = 90°, cosα = 0):\n\nd = a sqrt(1/3) = a / sqrt(3), which is correct.\n\nFor α = 60°, cosα = 0.5:\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 + 1)/3 ) = a sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.816a, which is different from the cubic case, as expected.\n\nThus, using this simplified formula confirms our earlier result. Therefore, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Rounding to two decimal places, 9.54 Å, or to two significant figures, 9.5 Å. Since the given interatomic distance is 10 Å (possibly two significant figures), the answer should be 9.5 Å.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \\boxed{9.54 \\text{ Å}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390959, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=10341, prompt_tokens=1209, total_tokens=11550, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

To find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Å and angles α = β = γ = 30°, we use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. 

The simplified formula for the (111) plane is derived as follows:

\[
d_{hkl} = a \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\cos\alpha}{3}}
\]

Given:
- \( a = 10 \) Å
- \( \alpha = 30^\circ \)
- \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
d_{111} = 10 \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}{3}}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d_{111} = 10 \sqrt{\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{3}}
\]

Calculate the numerical value:

\[
\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{3} \approx \frac{1 + 1.732}{3} \approx \frac{2.732}{3} \approx 0.9107
\]

\[
\sqrt{0.9107} \approx 0.954
\]

\[
d_{111} \approx 10 \times 0.954 \approx 9.54 \text{ Å}
\]

Thus, the interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \boxed{9.54 \text{ Å}}.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

is:

1/d² = (h a*)^2 + (k b*)^2 + (l c*)^2 + 2hk a* b* cosγ* + 2kl b* c* cosα* + 2lh c* a* cosβ*

But in the case of a rhombohedral system, since the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, the angles in reciprocal space (α*, β*, γ*) might be related to the real space angles α, β, γ. However, calculating this might get too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the interplanar spacing in the rhombohedral system. After some research, I found that in the rhombohedral system, the formula for d_{hkl} is:

1/d² = [(h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα)] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]

But I need to confirm if this is correct. Let me check the units. The left side is 1/d², which has units of 1/length². The right side numerator has terms with sin²α (dimensionless) and (cos²α - cosα) (dimensionless), multiplied by (h² + k² + l²) and 2(hk + kl + lh), which are dimensionless since h, k, l are integers. Then the denominator is a² times (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α), which is dimensionless. So overall, it's 1/a², which makes sense. So the formula is dimensionally consistent.

Given that, let's plug in the values. The problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which is the edge length a. So a = 10 Å. The angles α = β = γ = 30°, so α = 30°. The Miller indices are (111), so h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.

Plugging into the formula:

1/d² = [(1² + 1² + 1²) sin²30° + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)(cos²30° - cos30°)] / [10²(1 - 3cos²30° + 2cos³30°)]

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute the numerator:

First term: (1 + 1 + 1) sin²30° = 3 * (sin30°)^2

sin30° = 0.5, so sin²30° = 0.25. Hence, first term = 3 * 0.25 = 0.75

Second term: 2*(1 + 1 + 1)*(cos²30° - cos30°) = 2*3*(cos²30° - cos30°)

cos30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

cos²30° = (√3/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75

Thus, cos²30° - cos30° = 0.75 - 0.8660 ≈ -0.1160

Hence, second term = 2*3*(-0.1160) ≈ 6*(-0.1160) ≈ -0.696

Therefore, numerator = 0.75 + (-0.696) ≈ 0.054

Now, compute the denominator:

10²*(1 - 3cos²30° + 2cos³30°)

First, compute 1 - 3cos²30° + 2cos³30°

We already have cos²30° = 0.75 and cos³30° = (√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8 ≈ 0.6495

So:

1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) = 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ (1 - 2.25) + 1.299 = (-1.25) + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

Therefore, denominator = 100 * 0.049 ≈ 4.9

Therefore, 1/d² ≈ 0.054 / 4.9 ≈ 0.01102

Then, d² ≈ 1 / 0.01102 ≈ 90.74

Therefore, d ≈ sqrt(90.74) ≈ 9.526 Angstroms

Wait, but this seems a bit counterintuitive. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and the interplanar distance for (111) is about 9.5? Hmm, depending on the angles, maybe. Let me check if the calculation steps are correct.

First, let's verify the formula again. The formula:

1/d² = [(h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα)] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]

Is this the correct formula for the rhombohedral system? I need to be careful here because different sources might present different formulas depending on the coordinate system used.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the general triclinic formula. For a triclinic system, the formula for 1/d² is:

1/d² = (1 / V²) [ S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2 S12 h k + 2 S23 k l + 2 S13 h l ]

Where S11, S22, S33, S12, S23, S13 are the elements of the metric tensor. For a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c and α = β = γ, the metric tensor will have all diagonal elements equal and all off-diagonal elements equal.

The metric tensor G for real space lattice vectors is:

G = [ a²   a² cosγ   a² cosβ
      a² cosγ   a²   a² cosα
      a² cosβ   a² cosα   a² ]

But in the rhombohedral system, α = β = γ, so:

G = [ a²   a² cosα   a² cosα
      a² cosα   a²   a² cosα
      a² cosα   a² cosα   a² ]

Then, the metric tensor in reciprocal space is G*, which is the inverse of G. The elements of G* can be calculated, but perhaps this is getting too complex.

Alternatively, using the formula for triclinic:

The volume V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α). Wait, we had that earlier.

Alternatively, the inverse of the metric tensor (reciprocal metric tensor) can be used to compute 1/d².

But maybe another approach. Let's consider the (111) planes. The interplanar distance d_{hkl} can be calculated as the distance from the origin to the plane (111). In vector terms, the plane (hkl) is defined by the equation hx + ky + lz = n, where n is an integer. The distance from the origin to the plane is |n| / sqrt(h² + k² + l²) in a cubic system, but in non-cubic systems, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, the distance can be computed using the formula:

d_{hkl} = 1 / |G_{hkl}|

Where G_{hkl} is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane. The magnitude of G is |G| = 1/d.

But to compute G, we need the reciprocal lattice vectors. Let's try this approach.

In real space, the primitive vectors of the rhombohedral lattice can be written as:

a1 = a [1, 0, 0]

a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]

a3 = a [cosα, cosα cotθ, something]

Wait, maybe not. Let me recall the standard rhombohedral primitive vectors.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the primitive vectors can be considered as vectors of equal length a, with equal angles α between each pair. The coordinates can be written in terms of a Cartesian system, but it's a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps using the reciprocal lattice vectors. The reciprocal lattice vectors b1, b2, b3 satisfy:

b1 = 2π (a2 × a3) / V

b2 = 2π (a3 × a1) / V

b3 = 2π (a1 × a2) / V

Where V is the volume of the real space unit cell.

Given that, let's compute V first. As before, V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α). For α = 30°, let's compute this term.

First, compute 1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α:

cosα = cos30° ≈ 0.8660

cos²α ≈ 0.75

cos³α ≈ 0.6495

So:

1 - 3*0.75 + 2*0.6495 = 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 1 - 2.25 = -1.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

Thus, V = a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ a³ * 0.2217

Given a = 10 Å, V ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³

Now, compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. Let's first compute a2 × a3.

But to compute the cross product, we need the actual components of a2 and a3. Let's define the real space vectors.

Let me choose a coordinate system where a1 is along the x-axis. Then:

a1 = a [1, 0, 0]

a2 = a [cosα, sinα, 0]

a3 = a [cosα, cosα cotθ, something]. Wait, actually, in a rhombohedral system, all three vectors have the same length and the angle between any two is α. So, the third vector a3 can be written in terms of components. Let me recall that in a rhombohedral lattice, the vectors are such that each has equal length and equal angles between them.

To define a3, since the angle between a1 and a3 is α, and the angle between a2 and a3 is also α. Let me use spherical coordinates. Let’s denote the components of a3 as (a cosφ, a sinφ cosθ, a sinφ sinθ). The angle between a1 and a3 is α, so the dot product between a1 and a3 is a² cosα = a * a * cosφ. Therefore, cosφ = cosα => φ = α.

Similarly, the angle between a2 and a3 is α. The dot product between a2 and a3 is a² cosα = (a1 • a2) * (a1 • a3) + ... Wait, maybe it's easier to write the components.

Given a1 = (a, 0, 0)

a2 = (a cosα, a sinα, 0)

Now, let a3 = (a cosα, a sinα cosβ, a sinα sinβ)

We need the angle between a2 and a3 to be α. Let's compute the dot product:

a2 • a3 = a² [cosα * cosα + sinα * sinα cosβ + 0 * sinα sinβ] = a² [cos²α + sin²α cosβ]

The magnitude of a2 and a3 is a, so the dot product is a² cosα. Therefore:

cos²α + sin²α cosβ = cosα

Solving for cosβ:

sin²α cosβ = cosα - cos²α

cosβ = (cosα - cos²α) / sin²α

But sin²α = 1 - cos²α, so:

cosβ = [cosα (1 - cosα)] / (1 - cos²α) = [cosα (1 - cosα)] / [(1 - cosα)(1 + cosα)] ) = cosα / (1 + cosα)

Therefore, cosβ = cosα / (1 + cosα)

For α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

cosβ = (√3/2) / (1 + √3/2) = (√3/2) / ( (2 + √3)/2 ) = √3 / (2 + √3)

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):

√3 (2 - √3) / [ (2 + √3)(2 - √3) ] = [2√3 - 3] / (4 - 3) = 2√3 - 3 ≈ 2*1.732 - 3 ≈ 3.464 - 3 ≈ 0.464

Therefore, β ≈ cos⁻¹(0.464) ≈ 62.3 degrees

But this seems complicated, perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe the third vector a3 can be written as (a cosα, a cosα, a cosα), but normalized? No, because then the angle between a1 and a3 would be arccos( (a cosα)/a ) = α, which is correct, but the magnitude of a3 would be a sqrt(cos²α + cos²α + cos²α) = a sqrt(3 cos²α) = a cosα sqrt(3). But we need the magnitude to be a, so that would require cosα sqrt(3) = 1 => cosα = 1/√3 ≈ 54.7 degrees, which is not our case here. So that approach may not work.

Alternatively, maybe the standard way to define a rhombohedral lattice is with vectors:

a1 = a (1, 0, 0)

a2 = a (m, n, 0)

a3 = a (p, q, r)

Such that the angles between any two vectors are α. But this might require solving a system of equations.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that in a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be expressed in terms of the real space vectors. However, this is getting too involved. Maybe I should stick to the initial formula I used for 1/d² and check if the calculation was correct.

Wait, when I calculated 1/d² ≈ 0.01102 Å⁻², leading to d ≈ 9.526 Å. But the edge length is 10 Å, so this seems plausible. Let me check with another approach.

Alternatively, in a cubic system (where α = 90°), the interplanar distance for (111) would be a / sqrt(1² + 1² + 1²) = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å for a = 10 Å. But in this case, with α = 30°, the interplanar distance is larger, which makes sense because the planes are more closely packed? Wait, no, wait. If the angles are smaller (30° instead of 90°), the structure is more compressed along the axes, so maybe the interplanar distance could be larger or smaller depending on the orientation.

Alternatively, let's consider a hexagonal system. If the crystal were hexagonal, the (001) planes would have a spacing equal to the c-axis length. But we have a rhombohedral system here. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Since the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude is |G| = 2π/d, and d = 2π/|G|.

But to compute |G| for the (111) reflection, we need to express G as h b1 + k b2 + l b3, where b1, b2, b3 are the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Given that real space vectors are a1, a2, a3, the reciprocal vectors are defined as:

b1 = 2π (a2 × a3) / V

Similarly for b2 and b3.

But since I don't have the exact components of a2 and a3, this might be hard. Alternatively, note that for a rhombohedral lattice, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, with angles α* and lattice constants a*, where:

a* = (2π / a) * (sinα) / sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

But I need to verify this. Alternatively, the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vectors can be found.

Alternatively, perhaps use the metric tensor.

In real space, the metric tensor G is:

G_ij = a_i • a_j

Given that all |a_i| = a and the angles between any two a_i and a_j is α, then:

G = a² [ 1      cosα   cosα
          cosα   1      cosα
          cosα   cosα    1 ]

The inverse of this matrix, G⁻¹, is the reciprocal metric tensor. The elements of G⁻¹ can be calculated using the formula for the inverse of a 3x3 matrix, but it's a bit tedious.

Alternatively, since the metric tensor is a 3x3 matrix with diagonal elements a² and off-diagonal elements a² cosα, we can use the formula for the inverse of such a matrix. For a matrix of the form:

[ b   c   c
  c   b   c
  c   c   b ]

The inverse is (1/det) * [ ... ].

But let me compute the determinant first. The determinant of G is:

|G| = a² [ a² (a² - a² cos²α) - a² cosα (a² cosα - a² cos²α) + a² cosα (a² cos²α - a² cosα) ]

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, use the fact that the determinant of a 3x3 matrix with diagonal entries d and off-diagonal entries o is:

det = (d - o)^2 (d + 2o)

So here, d = a², o = a² cosα. Then,

det = (a² - a² cosα)^2 (a² + 2a² cosα) = a^6 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα)

Therefore, det = a^6 (1 - cosα)^2 (1 + 2 cosα)

Then, the inverse matrix G⁻¹ will have elements:

For diagonal entries: [ (d + o) ] / det ?

Wait, no. The inverse of a matrix with diagonal entries d and off-diagonal entries o is a matrix with diagonal entries (d + (n-2)o) / det and off-diagonal entries -o / det for n x n matrices. But for a 3x3 matrix, the formula is more complex.

Alternatively, use the formula for each element:

G⁻¹_ij = (G⁻¹)_ij = (1/det) * [ cofactor of G_ij ]

But this is time-consuming. Alternatively, note that for the metric tensor G, the reciprocal metric tensor G⁻¹ is related to the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Alternatively, since calculating G⁻¹ is complicated, maybe use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the metric tensor.

The square of the interplanar distance is given by:

d² = 1 / ( h² G⁻¹_11 + k² G⁻¹_22 + l² G⁻¹_33 + 2hk G⁻¹_12 + 2kl G⁻¹_23 + 2lh G⁻¹_13 )

But since we have a rhombohedral system, all the diagonal elements of G⁻¹ are equal, and all the off-diagonal elements are equal. Let's denote G⁻¹_11 = G⁻¹_22 = G⁻¹_33 = A, and G⁻¹_12 = G⁻¹_13 = G⁻¹_23 = B.

Therefore,

d² = 1 / [ A(h² + k² + l²) + 2B(hk + kl + lh) ]

So we need to compute A and B.

Given that G is:

[ a²     a² cosα   a² cosα
  a² cosα   a²     a² cosα
  a² cosα   a² cosα   a² ]

The inverse matrix G⁻¹ will have:

A = [ a² (a² - a² cos²α) ] / det

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the inverse of a matrix with diagonal entries d and off-diagonal entries o. For a 3x3 matrix:

The inverse can be calculated as:

(1/det) * [ (d^2 - o^2)      -o(d - o)       -o(d - o)
             -o(d - o)       (d^2 - o^2)      -o(d - o)
             -o(d - o)       -o(d - o)       (d^2 - o^2) ]

But I need to confirm this. Let me denote the matrix as M with diagonal elements d and off-diagonal elements o.

Then, the inverse M⁻¹ is (1/det(M)) times the adjugate matrix. Let's compute det(M):

det(M) = d^3 + 2o^3 - 3d o^2

For our case, d = a², o = a² cosα.

det(G) = (a²)^3 + 2(a² cosα)^3 - 3(a²)(a² cosα)^2

= a^6 [1 + 2cos³α - 3cos²α]

Which matches our earlier calculation.

Now, the elements of the adjugate matrix:

The diagonal entries are:

For the first diagonal element: determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 1:

| a²      a² cosα |
| a² cosα   a²    |

= a² * a² - (a² cosα)^2 = a^4 (1 - cos²α)

Similarly for the other diagonal entries.

The off-diagonal entries (for example, the element at (1,2)) is the cofactor, which is (-1)^{1+2} times the determinant of the submatrix:

| a² cosα   a² cosα |
| a² cosα   a²     |

= - [ a² cosα * a² - (a² cosα)^2 ] = -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)

Similarly, all off-diagonal entries in the adjugate matrix are -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)

Therefore, the adjugate matrix is:

[ a^4(1 - cos²α)   -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)   -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)
  -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)   a^4(1 - cos²α)   -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)
  -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)   -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα)   a^4(1 - cos²α) ]

Therefore, the inverse matrix G⁻¹ = adjugate / det(G):

G⁻¹_11 = [a^4(1 - cos²α)] / det(G)

Similarly for other diagonal elements.

G⁻¹_12 = [ -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα) ] / det(G)

Similarly for other off-diagonal elements.

But det(G) = a^6 (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

Therefore:

A = G⁻¹_11 = [a^4 (1 - cos²α)] / [a^6 (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)] = (1 - cos²α) / [a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)]

Similarly,

B = G⁻¹_12 = [ -a^4 cosα (1 - cosα) ] / [a^6 (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ] = -cosα (1 - cosα) / [a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]

Therefore, substituting back into the formula for d²:

d² = 1 / [ A(h² + k² + l²) + 2B(hk + kl + lh) ]

Plugging in A and B:

d² = 1 / [ (1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²)/(a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)) + 2*(-cosα (1 - cosα))(hk + kl + lh)/(a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)) ]

Factor out 1/(a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)):

d² = 1 / [ { (1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²) - 2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh) } / (a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)) ]

Therefore,

d² = a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ (1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²) - 2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ (1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²) - 2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh) ] )

Now, let's plug in the values:

a = 10 Å

α = 30°, so cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

h = k = l = 1

First, compute the numerator inside the sqrt:

1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )^3 = 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3)/8 = 1 - 2.25 + (3√3)/4 ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

Denominator inside the sqrt:

(1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²) - 2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh)

First, compute each part:

1 - cos²α = sin²α = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 = 0.25

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

So first term: 0.25 * 3 = 0.75

Second term:

2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh) = 2*(√3/2)*(1 - √3/2)*(3)

= 2*(0.8660)*(1 - 0.8660)*3

= 2*0.8660*0.1340*3 ≈ 2*0.8660*0.402 ≈ 2*0.348 ≈ 0.696

But since it's subtracted:

Denominator = 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054

Therefore,

d = 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.907) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

Which matches the previous result. Therefore, the interplanar distance d_{111} ≈ 9.52 Angstroms.

But let me check the exact calculation of 0.049 / 0.054. 0.049 / 0.054 is approximately 0.907, square root is approx 0.952, so 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å. So the answer is approximately 9.52 Angstroms.

But the question specifies a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Angstroms. Wait, in the rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance is the edge length a, which is the distance between adjacent atoms along the edges of the rhombohedron. So that would correspond to the lattice constant a = 10 Å. Therefore, our calculation seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the formula. Let's check with α = 90°, which should reduce to the cubic system.

If α = 90°, then cosα = 0. Then,

Numerator inside sqrt: 1 - 0 + 0 = 1

Denominator inside sqrt: (1 - 0)(3) - 0 = 3

Therefore, d = a sqrt(1/3) = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 10 / 1.732 ≈ 5.77 Å, which is correct for cubic (111) planes. So the formula works for α = 90°, which is a good check.

For α = 60°, which is a common angle in some crystals:

cosα = 0.5

Numerator: 1 - 3*(0.25) + 2*(0.125) = 1 - 0.75 + 0.25 = 0.5

Denominator: (1 - 0.25)(3) - 2*(0.5)*(1 - 0.5)*(3) = 0.75*3 - 0.5*0.5*3 = 2.25 - 0.75 = 1.5

Thus, d = a sqrt(0.5 / 1.5) = a sqrt(1/3) ≈ a / 1.732, same as cubic. But for α = 60°, the structure is face-centered cubic or body-centered cubic? Not sure, but the formula gives the same result as cubic, which might not be accurate. Wait, maybe α = 60° in a rhombohedral lattice corresponds to a different crystal system.

Alternatively, perhaps when α = 60°, the rhombohedral lattice is equivalent to a face-centered cubic lattice. In that case, the (111) interplanar distance would indeed be a / sqrt(3), since in FCC the (111) planes are close-packed. But in our calculation, even with α = 60°, we get the same result as cubic, which might indicate a limitation of the formula or my understanding.

But given that the formula works for α = 90°, and gives a reasonable value for α = 30°, and the steps have been double-checked, I think the answer of approximately 9.52 Å is correct.

But let's express it more precisely. Let's compute sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) exactly.

0.049 / 0.054 = 49 / 54 ≈ 0.907407

sqrt(49/54) = 7 / sqrt(54) ≈ 7 / 7.348 ≈ 0.952

Thus, d = 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

Rounding to two decimal places, 9.52 Å. But since the given interatomic distance is 10 Å, which has two significant figures, perhaps we should round to two significant figures, giving 9.5 Å. However, 10 has two significant figures, and the angles are given as 30°, which is exact. But in crystallography, sometimes angles are considered exact, so maybe we can keep three significant figures. Alternatively, check if the exact value can be expressed in terms of radicals.

Alternatively, compute the exact value using the exact terms.

Given α = 30°, cosα = √3/2, so:

Numerator inside sqrt:

1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )³ = 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3)/8 = 1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4

Convert to quarters:

= (4/4 - 9/4) + (3√3)/4 = (-5/4) + (3√3)/4 = ( -5 + 3√3 ) / 4

Denominator inside sqrt:

(1 - cos²α)(3) - 2cosα(1 - cosα)(3) = 3*(1 - 3/4) - 6*(√3/2)*(1 - √3/2) = 3*(1/4) - 6*(√3/2)*( (2 - √3)/2 )

= 3/4 - 6*(√3*(2 - √3))/4 = 3/4 - (6√3*(2 - √3))/4

Simplify:

= 3/4 - (12√3 - 6*3)/4 = 3/4 - (12√3 - 18)/4 = [3 - 12√3 + 18] / 4 = (21 - 12√3)/4

Therefore,

d = 10 * sqrt( [ (-5 + 3√3)/4 ] / [ (21 - 12√3)/4 ] ) = 10 * sqrt( (-5 + 3√3) / (21 - 12√3) )

Simplify the fraction:

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator's denominator:

( -5 + 3√3 ) / (21 - 12√3 ) * (21 + 12√3 ) / (21 + 12√3 )

Numerator: (-5)(21) + (-5)(12√3) + 3√3(21) + 3√3(12√3)

= -105 - 60√3 + 63√3 + 36*3

= -105 - 60√3 + 63√3 + 108

= ( -105 + 108 ) + ( -60√3 + 63√3 )

= 3 + 3√3

Denominator: (21)^2 - (12√3)^2 = 441 - 144*3 = 441 - 432 = 9

Therefore, the fraction becomes (3 + 3√3)/9 = (1 + √3)/3

Thus,

d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

Compute sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

Let’s compute (1 + √3)/3 ≈ (1 + 1.732)/3 ≈ 2.732 / 3 ≈ 0.9107

sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954

Therefore, d ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å

This is a more precise calculation, giving approximately 9.54 Å. However, considering significant figures, since the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms (one significant figure?), but angles are 30°, which is exact. Wait, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. If 10 is considered as two significant figures (with the decimal point implied), then the answer should be two significant figures, so 9.5 Å. However, if 10 is considered as one significant figure, it would be 10 Å, but that's unlikely in a crystallography context where parameters are usually known precisely. But the problem states "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom", without any decimal or uncertainty, which might imply one significant figure. However, in crystallography, lattice parameters are usually given with more precision, so maybe it's two significant figures. The angles are given as 30°, which is exact, so perhaps we can keep two decimal places in the answer.

But based on the exact expression:

d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ 10 * sqrt( (1 + 1.732)/3 ) ≈ 10 * sqrt(2.732 / 3) ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å

So approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Rounding to two decimal places, 9.54 Å, or to two significant figures, 9.5 Å.

But since the initial value is 10 Å (possibly two significant figures), angles are 30°, which is exact. Therefore, the answer should be 9.5 Å.

However, in the initial calculation using the formula, we got approximately 9.52 Å, and with the exact calculation, 9.54 Å. The difference is due to rounding at various steps. To be precise, let's compute sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) more accurately.

Compute √3 ≈ 1.7320508075688772

1 + √3 ≈ 2.7320508075688772

Divide by 3: 2.7320508075688772 / 3 ≈ 0.910683602522959

Square root: sqrt(0.910683602522959) ≈ 0.9542561953

Therefore, d ≈ 10 * 0.9542561953 ≈ 9.542561953 Å

So approximately 9.54 Å. Depending on the required precision, this would be 9.5 Å or 9.54 Å. Since the problem doesn't specify, but in crystallography, interplanar distances are often given to two decimal places, but since the given interatomic distance is 10 Å (maybe only one decimal place?), it's a bit ambiguous. However, given that 10 could be considered as two significant figures (if the trailing zero is significant), but without a decimal, it's ambiguous. In many contexts, 10 would be one significant figure, but in scientific notation, 10. would be two. Since it's written as 10 Angstrom without a decimal, it's safer to assume one significant figure, but given that angles are 30°, which is exact, and the answer requires precision, maybe we should present it with two decimal places as 9.54 Å.

However, in the initial step-by-step calculation, we got approximately 9.52 Å. The exact calculation gives 9.54 Å. The difference is due to rounding errors in the intermediate steps. The exact value is 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ 9.54 Å.

But let me check with another approach. Since the problem gives angles in degrees, and interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, maybe the expected answer is simply using a simplified formula.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (111) can be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh)cosα )

But this is for cubic systems with a different angle? Wait, no, that formula is for cubic systems with a distortion. Wait, perhaps in the case of a rhombohedral lattice, if we consider the cubic axes but with a rhombohedral distortion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in some references, the formula for the interplanar spacing in the rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) )

Which is similar to the formula I used earlier. Wait, let's check.

Yes, in the earlier calculation, we had:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]

But the formula I just wrote is different. Let me see:

If d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) )

Then,

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] / a²

But comparing with our previous result, this would mean that:

[ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] / a² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]

Which would require:

1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ]

But this is not generally true. Therefore, the formula I found in some references might be incorrect, or applicable under different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is the one we derived using the metric tensor, which gave us d = a sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ (1 - cos²α)(h² + k² + l²) - 2cosα (1 - cosα)(hk + kl + lh) ] )

Which for h = k = l = 1 becomes:

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ 3(1 - cos²α) - 6cosα(1 - cosα) ] )

Simplify denominator:

3(1 - cos²α) - 6cosα(1 - cosα) = 3(1 - cosα)(1 + cosα) - 6cosα(1 - cosα) = 3(1 - cosα)(1 + cosα - 2cosα ) = 3(1 - cosα)(1 - cosα) = 3(1 - cosα)^2

Therefore,

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ 3(1 - cosα)^2 ] )

Factor numerator:

1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = (1 - cosα)^2(1 + 2cosα)

Because:

(1 - cosα)^2(1 + 2cosα) = (1 - 2cosα + cos²α)(1 + 2cosα) = 1*(1 + 2cosα) - 2cosα(1 + 2cosα) + cos²α(1 + 2cosα)

= 1 + 2cosα - 2cosα - 4cos²α + cos²α + 2cos³α

= 1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore,

d = a sqrt( (1 - cosα)^2(1 + 2cosα) / [ 3(1 - cosα)^2 ] ) = a sqrt( (1 + 2cosα)/3 )

Thus,

d = a sqrt( (1 + 2cosα)/3 )

Wow, that's a much simpler formula! So for the (111) planes in a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance simplifies to:

d = a sqrt( (1 + 2cosα)/3 )

This is a elegant result. Let's verify this with our previous calculations.

Given a = 10 Å, α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Then,

(1 + 2cosα)/3 = (1 + 2*(√3/2))/3 = (1 + √3)/3 ≈ (1 + 1.732)/3 ≈ 2.732/3 ≈ 0.9107

sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954

Thus, d ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å

Which matches our previous exact calculation. This shows that the formula simplifies significantly for the (111) plane.

Therefore, the general formula for the interplanar distance of (111) in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{111} = a sqrt( (1 + 2cosα)/3 )

This is much easier to use and remember.

Given that, we can directly compute it:

d = 10 Å * sqrt( (1 + 2*cos30°)/3 )

cos30° = √3/2, so:

d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å

Therefore, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstroms.

This simplified formula makes sense because for a cubic system (α = 90°, cosα = 0):

d = a sqrt(1/3) = a / sqrt(3), which is correct.

For α = 60°, cosα = 0.5:

d = a sqrt( (1 + 1)/3 ) = a sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.816a, which is different from the cubic case, as expected.

Thus, using this simplified formula confirms our earlier result. Therefore, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Rounding to two decimal places, 9.54 Å, or to two significant figures, 9.5 Å. Since the given interatomic distance is 10 Å (possibly two significant figures), the answer should be 9.5 Å.


**Final Answer**
The interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \boxed{9.54 \text{ Å}}.

But let\'s check if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a different approach. For a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing can also be calculated using the formula:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin² α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos α - cos² α) ) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α )\n\nWait, perhaps that\'s another way to look at it.

Let me check the triclinic formula again. The general formula for 1/d² is:\n\n1/d² = [ h² sin² α (1 - cos² β - cos² γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ) + ... ] / V²\n\nWait, maybe I need to confirm another source. Alternatively, since rhombohedral can be expressed in hexagonal axes, perhaps the calculation is easier.\n\nBut maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the direct geometric approach.\n\nIn a rhombohedral lattice, the (111) planes are perpendicular to the [111] direction. The interplanar distance would be the distance between consecutive planes along this direction. The spacing can be calculated as the length of the vector in the [111] direction divided by the number of planes per unit length.\n\nAlternatively, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is equal to the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector G_{hkl}.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vector G_{hkl} is given by:\n\nG = h a* + k b* + l c*\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be calculated from the real space vectors.\n\nFirst, compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. Let me recall that for a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be found using:\n\na* = (b × c) / V\nb* = (c × a) / V\nc* = (a × b) / V\n\nGiven that all real space vectors have length a = 10 Å, and angles between them α = 30°, the cross product |b × c| is |b||c| sin α = a² sin α. The volume V is a³ √(1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α), as before.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of a* is |a*| = |b × c| / V = (a² sin α) / V\n\nSimilarly, |a*| = |b*| = |c*|, since the lattice is rhombohedral.\n\nCompute |a*|:\n\nV = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ≈ 10³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³\n\nThen |a*| = (a² sin α) / V = (100 * 0.5) / 221.7 ≈ 50 / 221.7 ≈ 0.2256 Å⁻¹\n\nSimilarly, the reciprocal lattice vectors have magnitude ≈0.2256 Å⁻¹\n\nBut the reciprocal lattice vectors in a rhombohedral system also have angles between them, say α*, which can be calculated using:\n\ncos α* = (cos α - cos² α) / (1 - cos² α)\n\nWait, the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors in a rhombohedral system is given by:\n\ncos α* = (cos α) / (1 + cos α)\n\nWait, I might need to verify this. Let me think.\n\nThe angle between a* and b* can be found using the dot product:\n\na* · b* = |a*||b*| cos α*\n\nBut the dot product a* · b* can be calculated as:\n\na* · b* = ( (b × c) / V ) · ( (c × a) / V )\n\nThis is equal to [ (b × c) · (c × a) ] / V²\n\nUsing vector identity: (b × c) · (c × a) = (b · c)(c · a) - (b · a)(c · c)\n\nBut since all vectors have length a and angles α between them:\n\nb · c = a² cos α\n\nc · a = a² cos α\n\nb · a = a² cos α\n\nc · c = a²\n\nTherefore:\n\n= (a² cos α)(a² cos α) - (a² cos α)(a²) ) = a^4 cos² α - a^4 cos α = a^4 (cos² α - cos α)\n\nTherefore, a* · b* = [ a^4 (cos² α - cos α) ] / V²\n\nBut |a*| |b*| cos α* = |a*|² cos α* since |a*| = |b*|\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos α* = [ a^4 (cos² α - cos α) ] / ( |a*|² V² )\n\nBut |a*|² = (a² sin α / V)^2 = a^4 sin² α / V²\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos α* = [ a^4 (cos² α - cos α) / V² ] / [ a^4 sin² α / V² ] = (cos² α - cos α) / sin² α\n\nSimplify:\n\ncos α* = [ cos α (cos α - 1) ] / (1 - cos² α ) = [ -cos α (1 - cos α) ] / ( (1 - cos α)(1 + cos α) ) ) = -cos α / (1 + cos α )\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos α* = -cos α / (1 + cos α )\n\nSo, for α = 30°, cos α = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\ncos α* = -0.8660 / (1 + 0.8660) ≈ -0.8660 / 1.8660 ≈ -0.4641\n\nTherefore, α* ≈ 117.6° (since arccos(-0.4641) ≈ 117.6°)\n\nBut this might not be necessary for our calculation. Let\'s return to the reciprocal lattice vector G for (111).\n\nG = a* + b* + c*\n\nSince all |a*| = |b*| = |c*| = 0.2256 Å⁻¹, and angles between them are α* ≈117.6°, the magnitude of G is:\n\n|G|² = |a*|² + |b*|² + |c*|² + 2(a*·b* + b*·c* + c*·a*)\n\nSince each dot product a*·b* = |a*||b*| cos α* = (0.2256)^2 * (-0.4641)\n\nCompute |G|²:\n\n3*(0.2256)^2 + 3*2*(0.2256)^2*(-0.4641)\n\nFirst term: 3*(0.0509) ≈ 0.1527\n\nSecond term: 6*(0.0509)*(-0.4641) ≈ 6*(-0.0236) ≈ -0.1416\n\nTotal |G|² ≈ 0.1527 - 0.1416 ≈ 0.0111\n\nTherefore, |G| ≈ sqrt(0.0111) ≈ 0.1053 Å⁻¹\n\nTherefore, the interplanar distance d = 1/|G| ≈ 9.5 Å, which matches our previous result of approximately 9.526 Å.\n\nSo, both methods give around 9.5 Angstroms. However, let me check once more for possible calculation errors.\n\nWait, in the reciprocal lattice calculation, the magnitude of G was found to be approximately 0.1053 Å⁻¹, so d = 1 / 0.1053 ≈ 9.5 Å. This is consistent with the first method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is exactly 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * sqrt(49/54) ≈ 10*(7)/(sqrt(54)) ≈ 10*7/(7.348) ≈ 9.526 Å. But sqrt(54) is about 7.348, so 70/7.348 ≈ 9.526. This seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s an error in the formula derivation. Let me check with a cubic system as a test case. If α = 90°, then cos α = 0, and sin α = 1.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nNumerator: 1 - 3*0 + 2*0 = 1\n\nDenominator: sin² 90°*(1+1+1) + 2*(0 - 0)*(...) = 1*3 + 0 = 3\n\nThus, d = a * sqrt(1 / 3) = a / sqrt(3), which matches the cubic (111) interplanar distance. So the formula works for the cubic case.\n\nTherefore, our formula seems valid, and the answer is approximately 9.5 Angstroms. However, let\'s compute it more precisely.\n\nCompute the exact value:\n\nNumerator: 1 - 3*(√3/2)^2 + 2*(√3/2)^3\n\nFirst, (√3/2)^2 = 3/4, so 3*(3/4) = 9/4\n\n(√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8, so 2*(3√3)/8 = (3√3)/4\n\nThen, numerator = 1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4 = (4/4 -9/4) + (3√3)/4 = (-5/4) + (3√3)/4\n\nConvert to decimal:\n\n-5/4 = -1.25\n\n3√3 ≈ 5.196, so 5.196/4 ≈ 1.299\n\nThus, numerator ≈ -1.25 +1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nDenominator: 3*(1/2)^2 + 6*( (3/4) - (√3/2) )\n\n= 3*(1/4) + 6*(0.75 - 0.8660)\n\n= 0.75 + 6*(-0.1160)\n\n= 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907407\n\nSquare root: sqrt(0.907407) ≈ 0.9526\n\nMultiply by a =10: 10 * 0.9526 ≈ 9.526 Å\n\nBut perhaps there is a more precise calculation. Let\'s compute sqrt(0.907407):\n\n0.952579 ≈ 0.9526\n\nThus, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.526 Angstroms. Depending on rounding, this can be presented as 9.53 Å or 9.5 Å. However, let\'s check if there\'s an exact expression.\n\nAlternatively, note that 0.049 / 0.054 = 49/54, so sqrt(49/54) = 7/(3√6) = 7√6/(3*6) = 7√6/18 ≈ 7*2.4495/18 ≈ 17.1465/18 ≈ 0.9525, so indeed, 7√6/18 ≈ 0.9525, so d = 10*(7√6)/18 = (70√6)/18 = (35√6)/9 ≈ 35*2.4495/9 ≈ 85.7325/9 ≈ 9.5258 Å.\n\nTherefore, the exact expression is (35√6)/9 Angstroms, which is approximately 9.53 Å.\n\nBut the problem states the angles are exactly 30°, so maybe we can present the answer in exact terms. Let\'s see:\n\nThe interplanar distance d is:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) / [ 3 sin² α + 6 (cos² α - cos α) ] )\n\nSubstituting α = 30°, cos α = √3/2, sin α = 1/2:\n\nNumerator inside sqrt:\n\n1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) = 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3/8 ) = 1 - 9/4 + 3√3/4\n\n= (4/4 -9/4) + 3√3/4 = (-5/4) + 3√3/4 = ( -5 + 3√3 ) /4\n\nDenominator inside sqrt:\n\n3*(1/2)^2 + 6*( (3/4) - (√3/2) ) = 3*(1/4) + 6*( 3/4 - √3/2 )\n\n= 3/4 + (18/4 - 6√3/2 )\n\n= 3/4 + 9/2 - 3√3\n\n= (3/4 + 18/4) - 3√3 = 21/4 - 3√3 = (21 - 12√3)/4\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\nd = a * sqrt( [ (-5 + 3√3)/4 ] / [ (21 - 12√3)/4 ] ) = a * sqrt( (-5 + 3√3)/(21 - 12√3) )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate to rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (21 + 12√3):\n\nNumerator: (-5 + 3√3)(21 + 12√3)\n\nDenominator: (21 - 12√3)(21 + 12√3) = 21² - (12√3)^2 = 441 - 144*3 = 441 - 432 = 9\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst, expand (-5)(21) + (-5)(12√3) + 3√3(21) + 3√3(12√3)\n\n= -105 - 60√3 + 63√3 + 36*3\n\n= -105 + ( -60√3 +63√3 ) + 108\n\n= -105 + 3√3 + 108\n\n= 3 + 3√3\n\nTherefore, sqrt( (3 + 3√3)/9 ) = sqrt( (3(1 + √3))/9 ) = sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) = sqrt(1 + √3)/sqrt(3)\n\nBut this seems conflicting. Wait, wait:\n\nWait, after rationalizing, the numerator becomes 3 + 3√3, denominator 9, so:\n\nsqrt( (3 + 3√3)/9 ) = sqrt( (3(1 + √3))/9 ) = sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) = sqrt(1 + √3)/sqrt(3)\n\nBut sqrt(1 + √3)/sqrt(3) can be simplified further.\n\nAlternatively, compute:\n\nsqrt(1 + √3)/sqrt(3) = sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )\n\nBut perhaps leave it as sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )\n\nTherefore, the exact expression is:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )\n\nSince a = 10 Å,\n\nd = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) Å\n\nCompute this value:\n\n(1 + √3)/3 ≈ (1 + 1.732)/3 ≈ 2.732/3 ≈ 0.9107\n\nsqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954\n\nTherefore, d ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous result of approximately 9.53 Å. There must be an error in the rationalization step.\n\nWait, let\'s re-examine the rationalization step:\n\nWe had:\n\nNumerator after expansion: 3 + 3√3\n\nDenominator after expansion:9\n\nTherefore, the fraction inside the sqrt is (3 + 3√3)/9 = (1 + √3)/3\n\nTherefore, sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )\n\nTherefore, d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )\n\nBut when we compute this numerically:\n\nsqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ sqrt( (1 + 1.732)/3 ) ≈ sqrt(2.732/3) ≈ sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954\n\nThus, d ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å\n\nBut earlier calculations gave 9.526 Å. The discrepancy arises because during the rationalization, we had:\n\nOriginal numerator inside sqrt: (-5 + 3√3)/4 divided by (21 - 12√3)/4\n\nWhich simplifies to (-5 + 3√3)/(21 - 12√3)\n\nThen, multiplying numerator and denominator by (21 + 12√3):\n\nNumerator: (-5 + 3√3)(21 + 12√3)\n\nLet me compute this again step by step:\n\nFirst term: -5*21 = -105\n\nSecond term: -5*12√3 = -60√3\n\nThird term: 3√3*21 = 63√3\n\nFourth term: 3√3*12√3 = 36*3 = 108\n\nCombine terms:\n\n-105 -60√3 +63√3 +108 = (-105 +108) + (-60√3 +63√3) = 3 + 3√3\n\nDenominator: (21 - 12√3)(21 + 12√3) = 21² - (12√3)^2 = 441 - 432 = 9\n\nThus, the fraction becomes (3 + 3√3)/9 = (1 + √3)/3\n\nTherefore, sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954\n\nTherefore, d ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å\n\nBut previously, using decimal approximations, we had 9.526 Å. The difference is due to rounding during intermediate steps.\n\nTherefore, the exact expression is 10*sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) Angstroms. Numerically, this is approximately 9.54 Å.\n\nHowever, let\'s check with a calculator:\n\nCompute (1 + √3)/3:\n\n√3 ≈ 1.73205\n\n1 + 1.73205 ≈ 2.73205\n\nDivide by 3: ≈0.910683\n\nSquare root: sqrt(0.910683) ≈0.954259\n\nMultiply by 10: ≈9.54259 Å ≈9.54 Å\n\nSo rounding to three significant figures, since the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms (one significant figure?), wait, no, 10 Angstroms is two significant figures. Wait, the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Depending on how it\'s written, "10 Angstroms" can be considered as two significant figures. However, angles are given as 30°, which is also two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be presented with two significant figures.\n\nBut 9.54 Å rounds to 9.5 Å (two significant figures). Alternatively, if 10 is considered as exact, then we might keep three. But in most cases, 10 Angstroms would be two significant figures. Therefore, the answer is approximately 9.5 Å.\n\nHowever, in the exact expression, we have 10*sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ). Let\'s compute this more precisely:\n\nsqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) = sqrt( (1 + 1.7320508075688772)/3 ) = sqrt(2.7320508075688772 /3 ) = sqrt(0.910683602522959) ≈0.9542589876\n\nMultiply by 10: ≈9.542589876 Å\n\nRounded to two significant figures: 9.5 Å\n\nRounded to three significant figures:9.54 Å\n\nSince the given data (10 Angstroms, 30 degrees) are likely two significant figures, the answer should be 9.5 Å. However, the exact fractional form is 10*sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ), which is approximately 9.54 Å. Depending on the required precision, the problem might expect the exact form or the approximate value.\n\nBut the problem doesn\'t specify, so perhaps present the exact form or the approximate value with three significant figures. However, in the initial calculation, using approximate steps, we got around 9.53 Å, which is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a different approach where the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula for the distance from the origin to the plane (111) in the rhombohedral system.\n\nIn real space, the distance from the origin to the plane (hkl) is given by:\n\nd = |n · r| / |n|\n\nWhere n is the normal vector to the plane, and r is a vector from the origin to any point on the plane. For the plane (111), the normal vector can be found using the reciprocal lattice vector.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the distance between planes in terms of the unit cell parameters.\n\nBut perhaps this approach would lead to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, in a rhombohedral lattice, the (111) planes are spaced by the length of the primitive translation vector in the [111] direction divided by the number of planes. However, in a rhombohedral lattice, the [111] direction is actually the body diagonal of the rhombohedron.\n\nThe length of the body diagonal in a rhombohedron can be calculated using:\n\nL = a * sqrt(3 + 6 cos α )\n\nFor α = 30°, cos α = √3/2 ≈0.8660\n\nSo,\n\nL = 10 * sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = 10 * sqrt(3 + 3√3 )\n\nCompute inside the sqrt:\n\n3 + 3√3 ≈3 + 5.196 ≈8.196\n\nsqrt(8.196) ≈2.864\n\nTherefore, L ≈10 *2.864 ≈28.64 Å\n\nBut this is the length of the body diagonal. If we consider the number of (111) planes along this diagonal, but in a rhombohedral lattice, the (111) planes are not necessarily spaced by L/n, because the planes are not necessarily perpendicular to the body diagonal. Wait, but earlier calculations suggested the interplanar distance is around 9.5 Å, which is less than the body diagonal length. Therefore, this approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, the interplanar distance can be calculated as the volume divided by the area of the (111) plane.\n\nBut the area of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice is not straightforward to compute.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell volume and the Miller indices:\n\nd_{hkl} = V / sqrt( (h a*)^2 + (k b*)^2 + (l c*)^2 + ... )\n\nBut this seems similar to the reciprocal lattice approach.\n\nGiven that multiple methods yield approximately 9.5 Å, and the exact expression is 10*sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈9.54 Å, I can conclude that the interplanar distance is approximately 9.5 Angstroms.\n\nBut perhaps I should check with another reference formula.\n\nAccording to some sources, for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing can be calculated using:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin² α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos α - cos² α) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]\n\nThis is the same formula I derived earlier. Using this formula, we can compute:\n\nNumerator:\n\n(1 + 1 + 1) sin² 30° + 2(1 + 1 + 1)(cos 30° - cos² 30° )\n\n= 3*(0.25) + 6*(0.8660 - 0.75)\n\n= 0.75 + 6*(0.116)\n\n= 0.75 + 0.696 = 1.446\n\nDenominator:\n\n10²*(1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495))\n\n= 100*(1 - 2.25 + 1.299)\n\n= 100*(0.049) = 4.9\n\nTherefore, 1/d² = 1.446 / 4.9 ≈0.2951\n\nThus, d ≈1 / sqrt(0.2951)≈1 /0.5432≈1.841 Å\n\nWait, this contradicts all previous results. But this can\'t be correct. What\'s wrong here?\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is:\n\n1/d² = [ numerator ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]\n\nBut in the numerator, we have [ (h² + k² + l²) sin² α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos α - cos² α) ]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nh = k = l =1, α=30°, a=10\n\nNumerator:\n\n(1 +1 +1)(sin² 30°) + 2(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)(cos 30° - cos² 30°)\n\n=3*(0.25) + 2*3*(0.8660 -0.75)\n\n=0.75 +6*(0.1160)\n\n=0.75 +0.696=1.446\n\nDenominator:\n\na²*(1 -3 cos² α +2 cos³ α)\n\n=100*(1 -3*(0.75) +2*(0.6495))\n\n=100*(1 -2.25 +1.299)\n\n=100*(0.049)=4.9\n\nThus, 1/d²=1.446/4.9≈0.2951\n\nTherefore, d≈1/sqrt(0.2951)≈1/0.5432≈1.841 Å\n\nBut this is vastly different from previous results. Clearly, this indicates a mistake in the formula application. But where?\n\nWait, this formula must be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps there\'s a typo in the formula. Let me check the source again.\n\nWait, the formula I derived earlier was:\n\nd = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) / [ sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] )\n\nBut in the above incorrect calculation, I used:\n\n1/d² = [ numerator ] / [ a² denominator ]\n\nBut according to the previous correct derivation, the formula is:\n\n1/d² = [ sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]\n\nTherefore, the numerator and denominator in the formula for 1/d² are inverted compared to the previous approach.\n\nWait, no. Let\'s go back.\n\nIn the correct derivation, we have:\n\n1/d² = [ sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]\n\nTherefore, in the previous incorrect calculation, I mistakenly used the formula as:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin² α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos α - cos² α) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]\n\nBut the correct formula has (cos² α - cos α) instead of (cos α - cos² α). This is a crucial difference.\n\nAh! There\'s the error. In the numerator of the formula, it\'s 2*(cos² α - cos α), not 2*(cos α - cos² alpha). Therefore, the correct numerator should be:\n\nsin² α*(h² + k² + l²) + 2*(cos² α - cos α)*(hk + kl + hl)\n\nIn the previous incorrect calculation, I used:\n\n2*(cos α - cos² alpha) which is negative of the correct term.\n\nTherefore, correcting this:\n\nNumerator:\n\n3*(0.25) + 2*(0.75 - 0.8660)*3\n\n= 0.75 + 2*(-0.1160)*3\n\n=0.75 - 0.696 =0.054\n\nDenominator:\n\na²*(0.049)=4.9\n\nTherefore, 1/d²=0.054/4.9≈0.01102\n\nThus, d≈1/sqrt(0.01102)≈1/0.105≈9.52 Å\n\nThis matches our previous results. Therefore, the mistake was in the sign of the second term in the numerator. The correct formula has (cos² α - cos α), which for α=30° is negative, leading to a reduction in the numerator.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation gives d≈9.52 Å, confirming our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.5 Angstroms.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \\boxed{9.54 \\text{ Å}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745391451, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=9179, prompt_tokens=607, total_tokens=9786, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic response

To determine the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Å and angles α = β = γ = 30°, we use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:

\[
d_{hkl} = a \sqrt{\frac{1 - 3 \cos^2 \alpha + 2 \cos^3 \alpha}{\sin^2 \alpha (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 (\cos^2 \alpha - \cos \alpha)(hk + kl + hl)}}
\]

Given:
- \( a = 10 \) Å
- \( \alpha = 30^\circ \)
- Miller indices \( h = 1 \), \( k = 1 \), \( l = 1 \)

First, compute the trigonometric values:
- \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660 \)
- \( \sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \)

Calculate the numerator inside the square root:
\[
1 - 3 \cos^2 30^\circ + 2 \cos^3 30^\circ
\]
\[
= 1 - 3 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= 1 - 3 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) + 2 \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)
\]
\[
= 1 - \frac{9}{4} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
\[
= \frac{4 - 9 + 3\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
\[
= \frac{-5 + 3\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
\[
\approx 0.049
\]

Calculate the denominator inside the square root:
\[
\sin^2 30^\circ (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) + 2 (\cos^2 30^\circ - \cos 30^\circ)(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1)
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot 3 + 2 \left(\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \cdot 3
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{4} \cdot 3 + 2 \left(\frac{3}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \cdot 3
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{4} + 6 \left(\frac{3 - 2\sqrt{3}}{4}\right)
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{4} + \frac{18 - 12\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
\[
= \frac{21 - 12\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
\[
\approx 0.054
\]

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
d_{111} = 10 \sqrt{\frac{0.049}{0.054}}
\]
\[
= 10 \sqrt{\frac{49}{54}}
\]
\[
= 10 \sqrt{\frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{3}}
\]
\[
\approx 10 \times 0.954
\]
\[
\approx 9.54 \text{ Å}
\]

The interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \boxed{9.54 \text{ Å}}.

Let me try this approach.

First, compute the volume V of the real space unit cell:
V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)
Plugging in α = 30°, a = 10 Å:
First compute cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660
Compute the term inside the square root:
1 - 3*(0.8660)² + 2*(0.8660)^3
Calculate each term:
3*(0.8660)^2 ≈ 3*0.75 = 2.25
2*(0.8660)^3 ≈ 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1.299
So:
1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ (1 - 2.25) +1.299 ≈ (-1.25) +1.299 ≈ 0.049
Then V ≈ (10)^3 * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³

Now, compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. Let's focus on the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector G for the (111) plane.

The reciprocal lattice vector G is given by:
G = h a* + k b* + l c*
For (111), h = 1, k = 1, l = 1.

But since the real space lattice is rhombohedral, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be determined. Alternatively, we can use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler formula for d_{hkl} in rhombohedral systems. Let me check some references in my mind. Wait, the general formula for triclinic systems is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2 S12 h k + 2 S23 k l + 2 S13 h l ]

Where S11 = b² c² sin² α
S22 = a² c² sin² β
S33 = a² b² sin² γ
S12 = a b c² (cos α cos β - cos γ)
S23 = a² b c (cos β cos γ - cos α)
S13 = a b² c (cos α cos γ - cos β)

But since it's rhombohedral, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. Let's denote a = b = c = a, and α = β = γ = α.

Therefore, S11 = S22 = S33 = a^4 sin² α
S12 = S23 = S13 = a^4 (cos² α - cos α) because:

Wait, let's compute S12 for example:
S12 = a * a * a² (cos α cos α - cos α) = a^4 (cos² α - cos α)

Similarly for S23 and S13.

Therefore, substituting into the triclinic formula:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ a^4 sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a^4 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ]

But we already have V = a³ √(1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α)

So V² = a^6 (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α )

Therefore,

1/d² = [ a^4 sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a^4 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] / [ a^6 (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

1/d² = [ sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]

Then, d = 1 / sqrt( [ sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ] )

Simplify:

d = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) / [ sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] )

Now, plugging in h = k = l = 1, α = 30°, a = 10 Å.

First, compute the numerator inside the square root: (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α)

We already did this before, which was 0.049.

Denominator inside the square root: sin² α (1 + 1 + 1) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 )

Simplify:

sin² α * 3 + 2 (cos² α - cos α) * 3

= 3 sin² α + 6 (cos² α - cos α)

Compute each term:

sin² 30° = (0.5)^2 = 0.25

3 * 0.25 = 0.75

cos² 30° = (√3/2)^2 = 0.75

cos α = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Then, cos² α - cos α = 0.75 - 0.8660 ≈ -0.1160

Multiply by 6: 6*(-0.1160) ≈ -0.696

Therefore, denominator inside the square root:

0.75 + (-0.696) ≈ 0.054

So, the entire expression under the square root is:

0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.9074

Thus, d = 10 Å * sqrt(0.9074) ≈ 10 * 0.9526 ≈ 9.526 Å

Wait, but this gives around 9.526 Angstroms, but I need to check if my calculations are correct.

Wait, let me check the denominator again:

Denominator inside the square root: 3 sin² α + 6 (cos² α - cos α)

But let's compute each term with exact values.

Given α = 30°, cos α = √3/2, sin α = 1/2.

Compute 3 sin² α = 3*(1/2)^2 = 3*(1/4) = 3/4 = 0.75

Compute 6*(cos² α - cos α) = 6*((3/4) - (√3/2)) = 6*(0.75 - 0.8660) = 6*(-0.1160) ≈ -0.696

So total denominator: 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054

Numerator inside the square root: (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α)

Compute:

1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3/2)^3 )

First, 3*(3/4) = 9/4 = 2.25

Then, (√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8 ≈ (3*1.732)/8 ≈ 5.196/8 ≈ 0.6495

Multiply by 2: 1.299

So total numerator: 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ (1 - 2.25) + 1.299 = (-1.25) + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

So numerator is 0.049, denominator is 0.054

Therefore, 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.9074

sqrt(0.9074) ≈ 0.9526

Thus, d ≈ 10 * 0.9526 ≈ 9.526 Å

But wait, this seems counterintuitive. The interplanar distance (111) in a rhombohedral system with angles 30 degrees and edge length 10 Å is approximately 9.526 Å. But let's check if this makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. For a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing can also be calculated using the formula:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) sin² α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos α - cos² α) ) / sqrt(1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α )

Wait, perhaps that's another way to look at it. Let me check.

Wait, the formula I derived earlier was:

d = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) / [ sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] )

So, substituting the values:

d = 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * sqrt(0.9074) ≈ 10 * 0.9526 ≈ 9.526 Å

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is inverted. Let me check the triclinic formula again. The general formula for 1/d² is:

1/d² = [ h² sin² α (1 - cos² β - cos² γ + 2 cos α cos β cos γ) + ... ] / V²

Wait, maybe I need to confirm another source. Alternatively, since rhombohedral can be expressed in hexagonal axes, perhaps the calculation is easier.

But maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the direct geometric approach.

In a rhombohedral lattice, the (111) planes are perpendicular to the [111] direction. The interplanar distance would be the distance between consecutive planes along this direction. The spacing can be calculated as the length of the vector in the [111] direction divided by the number of planes per unit length.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is equal to the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector G_{hkl}.

Let me try this approach.

The reciprocal lattice vector G_{hkl} is given by:

G = h a* + k b* + l c*

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be calculated from the real space vectors.

First, compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. Let me recall that for a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be found using:

a* = (b × c) / V
b* = (c × a) / V
c* = (a × b) / V

Given that all real space vectors have length a = 10 Å, and angles between them α = 30°, the cross product |b × c| is |b||c| sin α = a² sin α. The volume V is a³ √(1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α), as before.

Therefore, the magnitude of a* is |a*| = |b × c| / V = (a² sin α) / V

Similarly, |a*| = |b*| = |c*|, since the lattice is rhombohedral.

Compute |a*|:

V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ≈ 10³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³

Then |a*| = (a² sin α) / V = (100 * 0.5) / 221.7 ≈ 50 / 221.7 ≈ 0.2256 Å⁻¹

Similarly, the reciprocal lattice vectors have magnitude ≈0.2256 Å⁻¹

But the reciprocal lattice vectors in a rhombohedral system also have angles between them, say α*, which can be calculated using:

cos α* = (cos α - cos² α) / (1 - cos² α)

Wait, the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors in a rhombohedral system is given by:

cos α* = (cos α) / (1 + cos α)

Wait, I might need to verify this. Let me think.

The angle between a* and b* can be found using the dot product:

a* · b* = |a*||b*| cos α*

But the dot product a* · b* can be calculated as:

a* · b* = ( (b × c) / V ) · ( (c × a) / V )

This is equal to [ (b × c) · (c × a) ] / V²

Using vector identity: (b × c) · (c × a) = (b · c)(c · a) - (b · a)(c · c)

But since all vectors have length a and angles α between them:

b · c = a² cos α

c · a = a² cos α

b · a = a² cos α

c · c = a²

Therefore:

= (a² cos α)(a² cos α) - (a² cos α)(a²) ) = a^4 cos² α - a^4 cos α = a^4 (cos² α - cos α)

Therefore, a* · b* = [ a^4 (cos² α - cos α) ] / V²

But |a*| |b*| cos α* = |a*|² cos α* since |a*| = |b*|

Therefore,

cos α* = [ a^4 (cos² α - cos α) ] / ( |a*|² V² )

But |a*|² = (a² sin α / V)^2 = a^4 sin² α / V²

Therefore,

cos α* = [ a^4 (cos² α - cos α) / V² ] / [ a^4 sin² α / V² ] = (cos² α - cos α) / sin² α

Simplify:

cos α* = [ cos α (cos α - 1) ] / (1 - cos² α ) = [ -cos α (1 - cos α) ] / ( (1 - cos α)(1 + cos α) ) ) = -cos α / (1 + cos α )

Therefore,

cos α* = -cos α / (1 + cos α )

So, for α = 30°, cos α = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

cos α* = -0.8660 / (1 + 0.8660) ≈ -0.8660 / 1.8660 ≈ -0.4641

Therefore, α* ≈ 117.6° (since arccos(-0.4641) ≈ 117.6°)

But this might not be necessary for our calculation. Let's return to the reciprocal lattice vector G for (111).

G = a* + b* + c*

Since all |a*| = |b*| = |c*| = 0.2256 Å⁻¹, and angles between them are α* ≈117.6°, the magnitude of G is:

|G|² = |a*|² + |b*|² + |c*|² + 2(a*·b* + b*·c* + c*·a*)

Since each dot product a*·b* = |a*||b*| cos α* = (0.2256)^2 * (-0.4641)

Compute |G|²:

3*(0.2256)^2 + 3*2*(0.2256)^2*(-0.4641)

First term: 3*(0.0509) ≈ 0.1527

Second term: 6*(0.0509)*(-0.4641) ≈ 6*(-0.0236) ≈ -0.1416

Total |G|² ≈ 0.1527 - 0.1416 ≈ 0.0111

Therefore, |G| ≈ sqrt(0.0111) ≈ 0.1053 Å⁻¹

Therefore, the interplanar distance d = 1/|G| ≈ 9.5 Å, which matches our previous result of approximately 9.526 Å.

So, both methods give around 9.5 Angstroms. However, let me check once more for possible calculation errors.

Wait, in the reciprocal lattice calculation, the magnitude of G was found to be approximately 0.1053 Å⁻¹, so d = 1 / 0.1053 ≈ 9.5 Å. This is consistent with the first method.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is exactly 10 * sqrt(0.049 / 0.054) ≈ 10 * sqrt(49/54) ≈ 10*(7)/(sqrt(54)) ≈ 10*7/(7.348) ≈ 9.526 Å. But sqrt(54) is about 7.348, so 70/7.348 ≈ 9.526. This seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the formula derivation. Let me check with a cubic system as a test case. If α = 90°, then cos α = 0, and sin α = 1.

Plugging into the formula:

Numerator: 1 - 3*0 + 2*0 = 1

Denominator: sin² 90°*(1+1+1) + 2*(0 - 0)*(...) = 1*3 + 0 = 3

Thus, d = a * sqrt(1 / 3) = a / sqrt(3), which matches the cubic (111) interplanar distance. So the formula works for the cubic case.

Therefore, our formula seems valid, and the answer is approximately 9.5 Angstroms. However, let's compute it more precisely.

Compute the exact value:

Numerator: 1 - 3*(√3/2)^2 + 2*(√3/2)^3

First, (√3/2)^2 = 3/4, so 3*(3/4) = 9/4

(√3/2)^3 = (3√3)/8, so 2*(3√3)/8 = (3√3)/4

Then, numerator = 1 - 9/4 + (3√3)/4 = (4/4 -9/4) + (3√3)/4 = (-5/4) + (3√3)/4

Convert to decimal:

-5/4 = -1.25

3√3 ≈ 5.196, so 5.196/4 ≈ 1.299

Thus, numerator ≈ -1.25 +1.299 ≈ 0.049

Denominator: 3*(1/2)^2 + 6*( (3/4) - (√3/2) )

= 3*(1/4) + 6*(0.75 - 0.8660)

= 0.75 + 6*(-0.1160)

= 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054

Therefore, the ratio is 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907407

Square root: sqrt(0.907407) ≈ 0.9526

Multiply by a =10: 10 * 0.9526 ≈ 9.526 Å

But perhaps there is a more precise calculation. Let's compute sqrt(0.907407):

0.952579 ≈ 0.9526

Thus, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.526 Angstroms. Depending on rounding, this can be presented as 9.53 Å or 9.5 Å. However, let's check if there's an exact expression.

Alternatively, note that 0.049 / 0.054 = 49/54, so sqrt(49/54) = 7/(3√6) = 7√6/(3*6) = 7√6/18 ≈ 7*2.4495/18 ≈ 17.1465/18 ≈ 0.9525, so indeed, 7√6/18 ≈ 0.9525, so d = 10*(7√6)/18 = (70√6)/18 = (35√6)/9 ≈ 35*2.4495/9 ≈ 85.7325/9 ≈ 9.5258 Å.

Therefore, the exact expression is (35√6)/9 Angstroms, which is approximately 9.53 Å.

But the problem states the angles are exactly 30°, so maybe we can present the answer in exact terms. Let's see:

The interplanar distance d is:

d = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) / [ 3 sin² α + 6 (cos² α - cos α) ] )

Substituting α = 30°, cos α = √3/2, sin α = 1/2:

Numerator inside sqrt:

1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) = 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3/8 ) = 1 - 9/4 + 3√3/4

= (4/4 -9/4) + 3√3/4 = (-5/4) + 3√3/4 = ( -5 + 3√3 ) /4

Denominator inside sqrt:

3*(1/2)^2 + 6*( (3/4) - (√3/2) ) = 3*(1/4) + 6*( 3/4 - √3/2 )

= 3/4 + (18/4 - 6√3/2 )

= 3/4 + 9/2 - 3√3

= (3/4 + 18/4) - 3√3 = 21/4 - 3√3 = (21 - 12√3)/4

Therefore, the expression becomes:

d = a * sqrt( [ (-5 + 3√3)/4 ] / [ (21 - 12√3)/4 ] ) = a * sqrt( (-5 + 3√3)/(21 - 12√3) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate to rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (21 + 12√3):

Numerator: (-5 + 3√3)(21 + 12√3)

Denominator: (21 - 12√3)(21 + 12√3) = 21² - (12√3)^2 = 441 - 144*3 = 441 - 432 = 9

Compute numerator:

First, expand (-5)(21) + (-5)(12√3) + 3√3(21) + 3√3(12√3)

= -105 - 60√3 + 63√3 + 36*3

= -105 + ( -60√3 +63√3 ) + 108

= -105 + 3√3 + 108

= 3 + 3√3

Therefore, sqrt( (3 + 3√3)/9 ) = sqrt( (3(1 + √3))/9 ) = sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) = sqrt(1 + √3)/sqrt(3)

But this seems conflicting. Wait, wait:

Wait, after rationalizing, the numerator becomes 3 + 3√3, denominator 9, so:

sqrt( (3 + 3√3)/9 ) = sqrt( (3(1 + √3))/9 ) = sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) = sqrt(1 + √3)/sqrt(3)

But sqrt(1 + √3)/sqrt(3) can be simplified further.

Alternatively, compute:

sqrt(1 + √3)/sqrt(3) = sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

But perhaps leave it as sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

Therefore, the exact expression is:

d = a * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

Since a = 10 Å,

d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) Å

Compute this value:

(1 + √3)/3 ≈ (1 + 1.732)/3 ≈ 2.732/3 ≈ 0.9107

sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954

Therefore, d ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å

Wait, but this contradicts the previous result of approximately 9.53 Å. There must be an error in the rationalization step.

Wait, let's re-examine the rationalization step:

We had:

Numerator after expansion: 3 + 3√3

Denominator after expansion:9

Therefore, the fraction inside the sqrt is (3 + 3√3)/9 = (1 + √3)/3

Therefore, sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

Therefore, d = 10 * sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 )

But when we compute this numerically:

sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ sqrt( (1 + 1.732)/3 ) ≈ sqrt(2.732/3) ≈ sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954

Thus, d ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å

But earlier calculations gave 9.526 Å. The discrepancy arises because during the rationalization, we had:

Original numerator inside sqrt: (-5 + 3√3)/4 divided by (21 - 12√3)/4

Which simplifies to (-5 + 3√3)/(21 - 12√3)

Then, multiplying numerator and denominator by (21 + 12√3):

Numerator: (-5 + 3√3)(21 + 12√3)

Let me compute this again step by step:

First term: -5*21 = -105

Second term: -5*12√3 = -60√3

Third term: 3√3*21 = 63√3

Fourth term: 3√3*12√3 = 36*3 = 108

Combine terms:

-105 -60√3 +63√3 +108 = (-105 +108) + (-60√3 +63√3) = 3 + 3√3

Denominator: (21 - 12√3)(21 + 12√3) = 21² - (12√3)^2 = 441 - 432 = 9

Thus, the fraction becomes (3 + 3√3)/9 = (1 + √3)/3

Therefore, sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈ sqrt(0.9107) ≈ 0.954

Therefore, d ≈ 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å

But previously, using decimal approximations, we had 9.526 Å. The difference is due to rounding during intermediate steps.

Therefore, the exact expression is 10*sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) Angstroms. Numerically, this is approximately 9.54 Å.

However, let's check with a calculator:

Compute (1 + √3)/3:

√3 ≈ 1.73205

1 + 1.73205 ≈ 2.73205

Divide by 3: ≈0.910683

Square root: sqrt(0.910683) ≈0.954259

Multiply by 10: ≈9.54259 Å ≈9.54 Å

So rounding to three significant figures, since the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms (one significant figure?), wait, no, 10 Angstroms is two significant figures. Wait, the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Depending on how it's written, "10 Angstroms" can be considered as two significant figures. However, angles are given as 30°, which is also two significant figures. Therefore, the answer should be presented with two significant figures.

But 9.54 Å rounds to 9.5 Å (two significant figures). Alternatively, if 10 is considered as exact, then we might keep three. But in most cases, 10 Angstroms would be two significant figures. Therefore, the answer is approximately 9.5 Å.

However, in the exact expression, we have 10*sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ). Let's compute this more precisely:

sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) = sqrt( (1 + 1.7320508075688772)/3 ) = sqrt(2.7320508075688772 /3 ) = sqrt(0.910683602522959) ≈0.9542589876

Multiply by 10: ≈9.542589876 Å

Rounded to two significant figures: 9.5 Å

Rounded to three significant figures:9.54 Å

Since the given data (10 Angstroms, 30 degrees) are likely two significant figures, the answer should be 9.5 Å. However, the exact fractional form is 10*sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ), which is approximately 9.54 Å. Depending on the required precision, the problem might expect the exact form or the approximate value.

But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps present the exact form or the approximate value with three significant figures. However, in the initial calculation, using approximate steps, we got around 9.53 Å, which is consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach where the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula for the distance from the origin to the plane (111) in the rhombohedral system.

In real space, the distance from the origin to the plane (hkl) is given by:

d = |n · r| / |n|

Where n is the normal vector to the plane, and r is a vector from the origin to any point on the plane. For the plane (111), the normal vector can be found using the reciprocal lattice vector.

Alternatively, using the formula for the distance between planes in terms of the unit cell parameters.

But perhaps this approach would lead to the same result.

Alternatively, in a rhombohedral lattice, the (111) planes are spaced by the length of the primitive translation vector in the [111] direction divided by the number of planes. However, in a rhombohedral lattice, the [111] direction is actually the body diagonal of the rhombohedron.

The length of the body diagonal in a rhombohedron can be calculated using:

L = a * sqrt(3 + 6 cos α )

For α = 30°, cos α = √3/2 ≈0.8660

So,

L = 10 * sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = 10 * sqrt(3 + 3√3 )

Compute inside the sqrt:

3 + 3√3 ≈3 + 5.196 ≈8.196

sqrt(8.196) ≈2.864

Therefore, L ≈10 *2.864 ≈28.64 Å

But this is the length of the body diagonal. If we consider the number of (111) planes along this diagonal, but in a rhombohedral lattice, the (111) planes are not necessarily spaced by L/n, because the planes are not necessarily perpendicular to the body diagonal. Wait, but earlier calculations suggested the interplanar distance is around 9.5 Å, which is less than the body diagonal length. Therefore, this approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, the interplanar distance can be calculated as the volume divided by the area of the (111) plane.

But the area of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice is not straightforward to compute.

Alternatively, using the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell volume and the Miller indices:

d_{hkl} = V / sqrt( (h a*)^2 + (k b*)^2 + (l c*)^2 + ... )

But this seems similar to the reciprocal lattice approach.

Given that multiple methods yield approximately 9.5 Å, and the exact expression is 10*sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) ≈9.54 Å, I can conclude that the interplanar distance is approximately 9.5 Angstroms.

But perhaps I should check with another reference formula.

According to some sources, for a rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar spacing can be calculated using:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin² α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos α - cos² α) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]

This is the same formula I derived earlier. Using this formula, we can compute:

Numerator:

(1 + 1 + 1) sin² 30° + 2(1 + 1 + 1)(cos 30° - cos² 30° )

= 3*(0.25) + 6*(0.8660 - 0.75)

= 0.75 + 6*(0.116)

= 0.75 + 0.696 = 1.446

Denominator:

10²*(1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495))

= 100*(1 - 2.25 + 1.299)

= 100*(0.049) = 4.9

Therefore, 1/d² = 1.446 / 4.9 ≈0.2951

Thus, d ≈1 / sqrt(0.2951)≈1 /0.5432≈1.841 Å

Wait, this contradicts all previous results. But this can't be correct. What's wrong here?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is:

1/d² = [ numerator ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]

But in the numerator, we have [ (h² + k² + l²) sin² α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos α - cos² α) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

h = k = l =1, α=30°, a=10

Numerator:

(1 +1 +1)(sin² 30°) + 2(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)(cos 30° - cos² 30°)

=3*(0.25) + 2*3*(0.8660 -0.75)

=0.75 +6*(0.1160)

=0.75 +0.696=1.446

Denominator:

a²*(1 -3 cos² α +2 cos³ α)

=100*(1 -3*(0.75) +2*(0.6495))

=100*(1 -2.25 +1.299)

=100*(0.049)=4.9

Thus, 1/d²=1.446/4.9≈0.2951

Therefore, d≈1/sqrt(0.2951)≈1/0.5432≈1.841 Å

But this is vastly different from previous results. Clearly, this indicates a mistake in the formula application. But where?

Wait, this formula must be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the formula. Let me check the source again.

Wait, the formula I derived earlier was:

d = a * sqrt( (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) / [ sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] )

But in the above incorrect calculation, I used:

1/d² = [ numerator ] / [ a² denominator ]

But according to the previous correct derivation, the formula is:

1/d² = [ sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]

Therefore, the numerator and denominator in the formula for 1/d² are inverted compared to the previous approach.

Wait, no. Let's go back.

In the correct derivation, we have:

1/d² = [ sin² α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos² α - cos α)(hk + kl + hl) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]

Therefore, in the previous incorrect calculation, I mistakenly used the formula as:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin² α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos α - cos² α) ] / [ a² (1 - 3 cos² α + 2 cos³ α) ]

But the correct formula has (cos² α - cos α) instead of (cos α - cos² α). This is a crucial difference.

Ah! There's the error. In the numerator of the formula, it's 2*(cos² α - cos α), not 2*(cos α - cos² alpha). Therefore, the correct numerator should be:

sin² α*(h² + k² + l²) + 2*(cos² α - cos α)*(hk + kl + hl)

In the previous incorrect calculation, I used:

2*(cos α - cos² alpha) which is negative of the correct term.

Therefore, correcting this:

Numerator:

3*(0.25) + 2*(0.75 - 0.8660)*3

= 0.75 + 2*(-0.1160)*3

=0.75 - 0.696 =0.054

Denominator:

a²*(0.049)=4.9

Therefore, 1/d²=0.054/4.9≈0.01102

Thus, d≈1/sqrt(0.01102)≈1/0.105≈9.52 Å

This matches our previous results. Therefore, the mistake was in the sign of the second term in the numerator. The correct formula has (cos² α - cos α), which for α=30° is negative, leading to a reduction in the numerator.

Therefore, the correct calculation gives d≈9.52 Å, confirming our earlier result.

Therefore, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.5 Angstroms.

**Final Answer**
The interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \boxed{9.54 \text{ Å}}.

Let me check if there's a standard formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a rhombohedral system expressed in terms of hexagonal axes.\n\nWait, maybe converting the rhombohedral system to hexagonal coordinates would make it easier. The rhombohedral system can be described using a hexagonal unit cell with three times the volume. The conversion between rhombohedral and hexagonal axes is a standard procedure. However, this might complicate things further if I'm not familiar with the exact conversion factors. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, recalling that in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / √(h² + k² + l²). But for rhombohedral, which is a distortion of the cubic, the angles are not 90 degrees, so the formula must account for the angles. The formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / √[ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] / √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)\n\nBut I need to verify this formula. Let me check the derivation.\n\nStarting from the general triclinic formula, the interplanar distance is:\n\n1/d² = (1/V²) [ S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2S12 hk + 2S23 kl + 2S13 hl ]\n\nWhere S11, S22, S33 are the squares of the reciprocal lattice vectors, and S12, S23, S13 are the dot products of reciprocal lattice vectors.\n\nFor a rhombohedral system with a = b = c, α = β = γ, the reciprocal lattice parameters can be calculated. Let's compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.\n\nGiven the real space vectors a, b, c with |a| = |b| = |c| = a, and angles between any two vectors as α. The volume V is given by:\n\nV = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors are:\n\na* = (b × c) / V\n\nSimilarly for b* and c*.\n\nCalculating the magnitude of a*:\n\n|a*| = |b × c| / V\n\nThe cross product |b × c| is |b||c| sinα = a² sinα\n\nSo |a*| = a² sinα / V\n\nSimilarly, the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors (let's denote it as α*) can be found by the dot product:\n\na* · b* = (b × c) · (c × a) / V²\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors α* is related to the real space angle α. For a rhombohedral system, it's known that the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral with angles α*, where cosα* = [cosα / (1 + cosα)] perhaps? Not sure. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, using the relation for the reciprocal lattice parameters. For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters can be given by:\n\na* = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α))\n\nAnd the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors α* is given by:\n\ncosα* = -cosα / (1 + cosα)\n\nWait, let me verify this formula. If in real space, the angle is α, then in reciprocal space, the angle α* would be such that:\n\ncosα* = (cosβ cosγ - cosα) / (sinβ sinγ)\n\nBut since in rhombohedral, α = β = γ, so:\n\ncosα* = (cos²α - cosα) / sin²α\n\n= [cosα (cosα - 1)] / (1 - cos²α)\n\n= [ -cosα (1 - cosα) ] / (1 - cosα)(1 + cosα)\n\n= -cosα / (1 + cosα)\n\nTherefore, cosα* = -cosα / (1 + cosα)\n\nSo that's correct. So in reciprocal space, the angles are α* where cosα* = -cosα / (1 + cosα)\n\nGiven that α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nTherefore, cosα* = -√3/2 / (1 + √3/2) = -√3/(2 + √3)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):\n\ncosα* = -√3(2 - √3) / [(2 + √3)(2 - √3)] = -√3(2 - √3) / (4 - 3) = -√3(2 - √3)\n\nCalculating:\n\n√3 ≈ 1.732, so 2 - √3 ≈ 0.2679\n\nTherefore, cosα* ≈ -1.732 * 0.2679 ≈ -0.464\n\nSo α* ≈ arccos(-0.464) ≈ 117.7 degrees.\n\nBut perhaps I don't need this. Let me return to the reciprocal lattice parameters.\n\nThe magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector is |a*| = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α))\n\nWait, let's compute V first:\n\nV = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)\n\nGiven a = 10 Å, α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nCompute the term under the square root:\n\n1 - 3*(0.8660)^2 + 2*(0.8660)^3\n\nFirst, 3*(0.8660)^2: 3*(0.75) = 2.25\n\nWait, (√3/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So 3*0.75 = 2.25\n\nThen 2*(0.8660)^3: 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) = 2*(3√3/8) = 3√3/4 ≈ 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1.299\n\nThus, 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 1 - 2.25 = -1.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nTherefore, V = a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 10^3 * 0.2217 ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³\n\nSo V ≈ 221.7 cubic Angstroms.\n\nNow, the reciprocal lattice parameter |a*| = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α))\n\nCompute denominator:\n\na sinα = 10 * sin(30°) = 10 * 0.5 = 5\n\nsqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) = sqrt(0.049) ≈ 0.2217\n\nThus, denominator ≈ 5 * 0.2217 ≈ 1.1085\n\nTherefore, |a*| ≈ 1 / 1.1085 ≈ 0.902 Å^{-1}\n\nSimilarly, the reciprocal lattice vectors have magnitude ~0.902 Å^{-1}\n\nBut perhaps this is not directly helpful. Alternatively, the interplanar distance is 1 / |G|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane.\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vector G for (hkl) is given by G = h a* + k b* + l c*\n\nThe magnitude |G| is sqrt( G · G )\n\nCompute G · G:\n\n= h² |a*|² + k² |b*|² + l² |c*|² + 2hk a* · b* + 2kl b* · c* + 2hl a* · c*\n\nSince in rhombohedral, |a*| = |b*| = |c*| = 1/d_{100} (for instance)\n\nBut given the earlier calculation, |a*| ≈ 0.902 Å^{-1}\n\nAlso, the dot product between a* and b* is |a*||b*| cosα*\n\nFrom before, cosα* = -cosα / (1 + cosα) ≈ -0.8660 / (1 + 0.8660) ≈ -0.8660 / 1.8660 ≈ -0.464\n\nThus, a* · b* = |a*|² cosα*\n\nSimilarly, since |a*| = |b*|, and the angle between a* and b* is α*\n\nTherefore, G · G = |a*|² [ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + hl) cosα* ]\n\nThus, |G| = |a*| sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + hl) cosα* )\n\nTherefore, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} = 1 / |G| = 1 / [ |a*| sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + hl) cosα* ) ]\n\nBut since |a*| = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)) ), which is 1 / (a sinα sqrt(V / a³)) )\n\nBut perhaps substituting |a*| from the earlier calculation.\n\nGiven |a*| ≈ 0.902 Å^{-1}, and cosα* ≈ -0.464\n\nSo for (111) plane, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1\n\nThus, the term inside the square root becomes:\n\n1² + 1² + 1² + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*(-0.464) = 3 + 2*(3)*(-0.464) = 3 - 6*0.464 ≈ 3 - 2.784 ≈ 0.216\n\nTherefore, |G| ≈ 0.902 * sqrt(0.216) ≈ 0.902 * 0.465 ≈ 0.419 Å^{-1}\n\nThus, d_{111} = 1 / 0.419 ≈ 2.387 Å\n\nBut wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. But this result is around 2.387 Å, which is much smaller. That can't be right. There must be an error in the calculation.\n\nWait, but the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which is the edge length a. But according to the calculation, the interplanar distance for (111) is ~2.4 Angstroms, which is smaller than a. However, in cubic systems, d_{111} is a / sqrt(3), which for a=10Å would be ~5.77Å. So if the rhombohedral is a distorted cubic with angles 30°, the interplanar distance would be different, but getting 2.4Å seems too small.\n\nPossibly, I made a mistake in the reciprocal lattice parameters. Let's re-examine the steps.\n\nFirst, the volume V was calculated as a³ * sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α). With a=10Å, α=30°, cosα=√3/2≈0.866.\n\nCompute 1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α:\n\n1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )^3\n\n= 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3/8)\n\n= (4/4 - 9/4) + (6√3)/8\n\n= (-5/4) + (3√3)/4\n\n≈ (-1.25) + (5.196)/4\n\n≈ (-1.25) + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nThus, V = 10³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³. That seems correct.\n\nThen, |a*| = (a² sinα)/V\n\nWait, earlier I thought |a*| = |b × c| / V = (a² sinα) / V\n\nBut |a*| is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector, which is 1 / (interplanar distance d_{100}), but in a rhombohedral system, the (100) planes aren't orthogonal, so perhaps this interpretation is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude |a*| is 1 / (d_{100} sinθ), where θ is the angle between the vector and the plane. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a triclinic system, which is:\n\n1/d² = (1/V²) [ h² a² b² c² (1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ ) + ... ]\n\nBut given that in the rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ, this formula simplifies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula from the International Tables for Crystallography.\n\nUpon checking, the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system (trigonal) is given by:\n\n1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]\n\nWait, perhaps rearranged. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, referring to the following formula from literature:\n\nFor a rhombohedral lattice with parameters a and α, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is:\n\nd_{hkl} = a / sqrt( [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] / (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) )\n\nThus, putting it all together:\n\nd_{hkl} = a * sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] )\n\nGiven that, substituting the values:\n\na = 10 Å\n\nα = 30°, so sinα = 0.5, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nh = k = l = 1\n\nCompute numerator inside the sqrt:\n\n1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α ≈ 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049\n\nDenominator inside the sqrt:\n\n(1² + 1² + 1²) sin²α + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)(cosα - cos²α)\n\n= 3*(0.25) + 2*3*(0.8660 - 0.75)\n\n= 0.75 + 6*(0.1160)\n\n= 0.75 + 0.696 ≈ 1.446\n\nTherefore, the entire sqrt term is sqrt(0.049 / 1.446) ≈ sqrt(0.0339) ≈ 0.184\n\nThus, d_{111} = 10 * 0.184 ≈ 1.84 Å\n\nBut this is even smaller than before. Wait, this can't be correct either. The interatomic distance is 10 Å, so planes shouldn't be 1.84 Å apart. This suggests a mistake in the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I inverted numerator and denominator. Let me check the formula again.\n\nIf the formula is d_{hkl} = a * sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] )\n\nBut 0.049 / 1.446 ≈ 0.0339, sqrt of that is ~0.184. So 10 * 0.184 = 1.84 Å. But this is still too small. There must be a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let's recompute the denominator:\n\nDenominator:\n\n(h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α)\n\nFor hkl = 111:\n\n= (1 + 1 + 1) * (0.5)^2 + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*(0.8660 - 0.75)\n\n= 3 * 0.25 + 2*3*(0.116)\n\n= 0.75 + 6*0.116\n\n= 0.75 + 0.696 = 1.446. This is correct.\n\nNumerator:\n\n1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α ≈ 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 0.049 / 1.446 ≈ 0.0339, sqrt ≈ 0.184, so d ≈ 1.84 Å. However, this seems unphysical given the interatomic distance is 10 Å. So either the formula is incorrect, or my application is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the formula from the rhombohedral system expressed in terms of hexagonal axes. Let me try that approach.\n\nIn the hexagonal setting, a rhombohedral lattice can be described with a hexagonal unit cell, where a_hex = 2a_rhomb * sin(α/2), c_hex = a_rhomb * sqrt(3 - 12 sin²(α/2))\n\nBut this might not be necessary. Alternatively, the interplanar distance in the hexagonal system is given by:\n\n1/d² = 4/(3 a_hex²) (h² + hk + k²) + (l²)/(c_hex²)\n\nBut this is for the hexagonal system. However, since the rhombohedral can be expressed in hexagonal axes, perhaps converting the (111) rhombohedral indices to hexagonal indices.\n\nWait, in the rhombohedral to hexagonal transformation, the indices (hkl) in rhombohedral correspond to (h - k, k - l, h + k + l) in hexagonal? Not sure. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, the Miller indices in the rhombohedral and hexagonal systems are related by a transformation matrix. For the rhombohedral to hexagonal setting, the basis vectors are different. The hexagonal unit cell contains three rhombohedral unit cells.\n\nBut maybe this complicates things further. Let's try another approach.\n\nSuppose we model the rhombohedral lattice as a simple trigonal lattice with a = b = c = 10 Å, α = β = γ = 30°. The (111) planes are the planes that intercept all three axes at 1 unit each. The distance between such planes can be calculated using the formula for a general lattice.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. For a general triclinic lattice, the formula is:\n\n1/d² = (1/V²) [ S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2S12 hk + 2S23 kl + 2S13 hl ]\n\nWhere S11 = b²c² sin²α\n\nS22 = a²c² sin²β\n\nS33 = a²b² sin²γ\n\nS12 = a b c² (cosα cosβ - cosγ)\n\nS23 = a² b c (cosβ cosγ - cosα)\n\nS13 = a b² c (cosγ cosα - cosβ)\n\nBut in the rhombohedral case, a = b = c, α = β = γ, so S11 = S22 = S33 = a^4 sin²α\n\nSimilarly, S12 = S23 = S13 = a^4 (cos²α - cosα)\n\nTherefore, substituting into the formula:\n\n1/d² = (1/V²) [ a^4 sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a^4 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + kl + hl) ]\n\nFactor out a^4:\n\n1/d² = a^4 / V² [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + kl + hl) ]\n\nBut V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α), so V² = a^6 (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/d² = a^4 / [a^6 (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ] [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + kl + hl) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/d² = 1 / [a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ] [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + kl + hl) ]\n\nTherefore,\n\nd = a sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + kl + hl) ] )\n\nWhich is the same formula as before. So substituting the values:\n\na = 10 Å\n\nα = 30°, so sinα = 0.5, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660\n\nh = k = l = 1\n\nCompute numerator inside the sqrt:\n\n1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) ≈ 0.049\n\nDenominator inside the sqrt:\n\nsin²α*(3) + 2*(cos²α - cosα)*(3)\n\n= 0.25*3 + 2*(0.75 - 0.8660)*3\n\n= 0.75 + 2*(-0.116)*3\n\n= 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907\n\nThus, d = 10 * sqrt(0.907) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nWait, now this is a different result. Previously, the denominator was calculated as 1.446, but here it's 0.054. What's the discrepancy?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the denominator here:\n\nsin²α*(h² + k² + l²) + 2*(cos²α - cosα)*(hk + kl + hl)\n\n= sin²α*3 + 2*(cos²α - cosα)*3\n\n= 3*sin²α + 6*(cos²α - cosα)\n\nBut sin²α = 0.25, cos²α = 0.75, cosα = 0.8660\n\nSo:\n\n3*0.25 + 6*(0.75 - 0.8660)\n\n= 0.75 + 6*(-0.116)\n\n= 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054\n\nYes, correct.\n\nBut numerator is 0.049, so 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907\n\nThus, sqrt(0.907) ≈ 0.952, so d ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nThis is a more reasonable value, given the interatomic distance is 10 Å. So 9.52 Å for the (111) interplanar distance. But let me verify this again.\n\nWait, this suggests that the interplanar distance is almost equal to the lattice parameter. For a cubic system, d_{111} = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å for a=10 Å, but in this rhombohedral system with angles 30°, it's ~9.52 Å. That seems plausible if the planes are more spaced out due to the acute angles.\n\nBut let's cross-validate this. Suppose the rhombohedron is a cube compressed along the space diagonal, making angles 30°. The (111) planes are perpendicular to the space diagonal. The distance between these planes would be the length of the space diagonal divided by the number of planes. For a cube, the space diagonal is a√3, and there are planes spaced at intervals of a√3 / d_{111} = integer. For the cubic (111), d_{111} = a / √3. But in this case, the space diagonal is different.\n\nWait, the length of the space diagonal in a rhombohedron with edge length a and angle α between edges is given by:\n\nd = a sqrt(3 + 6 cosα)\n\nFor α = 30°, cosα = √3/2, so:\n\nd = a sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = a sqrt(3 + 3√3)\n\n≈ a sqrt(3 + 5.196) ≈ a sqrt(8.196) ≈ a * 2.864\n\nFor a=10Å, d ≈ 28.64 Å\n\nIf the (111) planes are perpendicular to this space diagonal, the interplanar distance would be d / n, where n is the number of planes. For (111), n=1, so d_{111} = |space diagonal| / |(111) reciprocal vector| ?\n\nWait, this is not straightforward. Alternatively, if the (111) planes are spaced along the space diagonal, the interplanar distance would be the projection of the lattice vector onto the space diagonal direction. Suppose a lattice vector along the space diagonal is (a, a, a). The length of this vector is sqrt(a² + a² + a² + 2a² cosα + 2a² cosα + 2a² cosα) = sqrt(3a² + 6a² cosα) = a sqrt(3 + 6 cosα). Which is the space diagonal length.\n\nThe interplanar distance d_{hkl} is equal to the spacing between planes, which for (hkl) is given by the formula we derived. If the formula gives ~9.52 Å, then the space diagonal is ~28.64 Å, which is about 3 times the interplanar distance. So 28.64 / 3 ≈ 9.55 Å, which aligns with our previous result. Therefore, this seems plausible. The three interplanar distances would span the space diagonal.\n\nTherefore, the interplanar distance for (111) in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.52 Å. Rounding to two decimal places, 9.5 Å. However, let's check the exact calculation.\n\nNumerator inside sqrt: 1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α\n\n= 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )^3\n\n= 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3)/8\n\n= (4/4 - 9/4) + (6√3)/8\n\n= (-5/4) + (3√3)/4\n\n= [ -5 + 3√3 ] / 4\n\nNumerical value:\n\n3√3 ≈ 5.196, so -5 + 5.196 ≈ 0.196, divided by 4 ≈ 0.049\n\nDenominator inside sqrt:\n\nsin²α*(h² + k² + l²) + 2*(cos²α - cosα)*(hk + kl + hl)\n\n= (1/4)*3 + 2*(3/4 - √3/2)*3\n\n= 3/4 + 2*( (3 - 2√3)/4 )*3\n\n= 3/4 + (6 - 4√3)/4 *3\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\ncos²α - cosα = 3/4 - √3/2 ≈ 0.75 - 0.866 ≈ -0.116\n\nMultiply by 2: 2*(-0.116) = -0.232\n\nMultiply by (hk + kl + hl) = 3: -0.232*3 ≈ -0.696\n\nAdd sin²α*(h² + k² + l²) = 0.25*3 = 0.75\n\nTotal denominator inside sqrt: 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054\n\nSo ratio = 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907\n\nTherefore, sqrt(0.907) ≈ 0.952\n\nThus, d = 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å\n\nTherefore, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.5 Angstroms. Given the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which is the edge length, this result makes sense, as the (111) planes are spaced nearly the full edge length apart, which is reasonable given the acute angles causing the planes to be further separated compared to a cubic system.\n\nTherefore, the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.5 Angstroms. Rounding to two significant figures, since the given interatomic distance is 10 (one significant figure?), but maybe it's two, 10.0? The answer would be approximately 9.5 Å. But let me check the exact calculation once more.\n\nAlternatively, using exact terms:\n\nNumerator inside sqrt:\n\n1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = 1 - 3*(√3/2)^2 + 2*(√3/2)^3\n\n= 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8)\n\n= 1 - 9/4 + 3√3/4\n\n= (4/4 - 9/4) + 3√3/4\n\n= (-5/4) + (3√3)/4\n\n= ( -5 + 3√3 ) / 4\n\nDenominator inside sqrt:\n\nsin²α*(h² + k² + l²) + 2*(cos²α - cosα)*(hk + kl + hl)\n\n= (1/2)^2*3 + 2*( (√3/2)^2 - √3/2 )*3\n\n= (1/4)*3 + 2*( (3/4 - √3/2 ))*3\n\n= 3/4 + 2*(3/4 - √3/2)*3\n\n= 3/4 + (3/2 - √3)*3\n\n= 3/4 + 9/2 - 3√3\n\nConvert to quarters:\n\n3/4 + 18/4 - 12√3/4\n\n= (21/4 - 12√3/4 )\n\n= (21 - 12√3)/4\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n\n( -5 + 3√3 ) / 4 divided by (21 - 12√3)/4\n\n= ( -5 + 3√3 ) / (21 - 12√3 )\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (21 + 12√3):\n\n[ (-5 + 3√3)(21 + 12√3) ] / [ (21)^2 - (12√3)^2 ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n= -5*21 + (-5)*12√3 + 3√3*21 + 3√3*12√3\n\n= -105 - 60√3 + 63√3 + 36*3\n\n= -105 + 3√3 + 108\n\n= 3 + 3√3\n\nDenominator:\n\n441 - 432*3\n\n= 441 - 1296\n\n= -855\n\nThus, ratio = (3 + 3√3)/(-855) = - (3(1 + √3)) / 855 ≈ - (3*2.732)/855 ≈ -8.196/855 ≈ -0.00958\n\nBut this is negative, which cannot be, as we are taking the square root. There must be a miscalculation.\n\nWait, but earlier numerical calculation gave a positive ratio.

However, in the exact calculation, after multiplying numerator and denominator by (21 + 12√3), the numerator became (3 + 3√3) and denominator became -855. But 3 + 3√3 ≈ 3 + 5.196 ≈ 8.196, so 8.196 / (-855) ≈ -0.00958, but this contradicts the approximate calculation. Hence, there must be an error in the exact calculation.\n\nWait, let's redo the exact multiplication:\n\nNumerator: (-5 + 3√3)(21 + 12√3)\n\n= (-5)(21) + (-5)(12√3) + (3√3)(21) + (3√3)(12√3)\n\n= -105 - 60√3 + 63√3 + 36*3\n\n= -105 + 3√3 + 108\n\n= ( -105 + 108 ) + 3√3\n\n= 3 + 3√3\n\nDenominator: (21)^2 - (12√3)^2 = 441 - (144 * 3) = 441 - 432 = 9\n\nWait, this is different from before. I previously miscalculated the denominator.\n\nCorrect denominator: 21² - (12√3)² = 441 - 144*3 = 441 - 432 = 9\n\nTherefore, ratio = (3 + 3√3)/9 = (1 + √3)/3 ≈ (1 + 1.732)/3 ≈ 2.732/3 ≈ 0.9106\n\nThus, sqrt(0.9106) ≈ 0.954\n\nTherefore, d = 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å\n\nWhich matches our approximate calculation earlier. Therefore, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Considering significant figures, the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms (one significant figure), but angles are given as 30° (two significant figures). However, since the answer came out to ~9.5, which is two significant figures, it's appropriate to present it as 9.5 Angstroms.\n\nBut let's use the exact symbolic expression:\n\nd = 10 * sqrt( ( -5 + 3√3 ) / (21 - 12√3) )\n\nBut since we rationalized it to (1 + √3)/3, then:\n\nsqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) = sqrt( (1 + 1.732)/3 ) = sqrt(2.732/3 ) ≈ sqrt(0.9106) ≈ 0.954\n\nThus, d ≈ 9.54 Å, which rounds to 9.5 Å or 9.54 Å depending on precision.\n\nTherefore, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.5 Angstroms.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \\boxed{9.5} Angstroms.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745391875, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=8649, prompt_tokens=819, total_tokens=9468, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To calculate the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance 10 Å and angles α = β = γ = 30°, we use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system:

\[
d_{hkl} = a \sqrt{\frac{1 - 3\cos^2\alpha + 2\cos^3\alpha}{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\sin^2\alpha + 2(hk + kl + lh)(\cos\alpha - \cos^2\alpha)}}
\]

Given:
- \(a = 10 \, \text{Å}\)
- \(\alpha = 30^\circ\)
- \(h = 1\), \(k = 1\), \(l = 1\)

First, compute the trigonometric values:
- \(\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866\)
- \(\sin 30^\circ = 0.5\)

Calculate the numerator inside the square root:
\[
1 - 3\cos^2\alpha + 2\cos^3\alpha = 1 - 3\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= 1 - 3 \cdot \frac{3}{4} + 2 \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]
\[
= 1 - \frac{9}{4} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]
\[
= \frac{4 - 9 + 3\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{-5 + 3\sqrt{3}}{4} \approx 0.049
\]

Calculate the denominator inside the square root:
\[
(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\sin^2\alpha + 2(hk + kl + lh)(\cos\alpha - \cos^2\alpha)
\]
\[
= 3 \cdot (0.5)^2 + 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \left(0.866 - (0.866)^2\right)
\]
\[
= 3 \cdot 0.25 + 6 \cdot (0.866 - 0.75)
\]
\[
= 0.75 + 6 \cdot 0.116
\]
\[
= 0.75 + 0.696 = 1.446
\]

Compute the ratio:
\[
\frac{0.049}{1.446} \approx 0.0339
\]

Take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{0.0339} \approx 0.184
\]

Multiply by the lattice parameter \(a = 10 \, \text{Å}\):
\[
d_{111} = 10 \cdot 0.184 \approx 1.84 \, \text{Å}
\]

However, upon re-evaluation using the correct rationalization and exact trigonometric values, the correct calculation gives:
\[
d_{111} = 10 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - 3\cos^2\alpha + 2\cos^3\alpha}{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)\sin^2\alpha + 2(hk + kl + lh)(\cos\alpha - \cos^2\alpha)}}
\]

After correcting the rationalization and verifying the steps, the final interplanar distance is found to be approximately 9.5 Å.

\[
\boxed{9.5}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) planes can be given by:

d_{hkl} = a / √[ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] / (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)^{1/2}

But this seems quite involved. Let me check if there's a standard formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a rhombohedral system expressed in terms of hexagonal axes.

Wait, maybe converting the rhombohedral system to hexagonal coordinates would make it easier. The rhombohedral system can be described using a hexagonal unit cell with three times the volume. The conversion between rhombohedral and hexagonal axes is a standard procedure. However, this might complicate things further if I'm not familiar with the exact conversion factors. Let me see.

Alternatively, recalling that in a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / √(h² + k² + l²). But for rhombohedral, which is a distortion of the cubic, the angles are not 90 degrees, so the formula must account for the angles. The formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice is:

d_{hkl} = a / √[ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] / √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

But I need to verify this formula. Let me check the derivation.

Starting from the general triclinic formula, the interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2S12 hk + 2S23 kl + 2S13 hl ]

Where S11, S22, S33 are the squares of the reciprocal lattice vectors, and S12, S23, S13 are the dot products of reciprocal lattice vectors.

For a rhombohedral system with a = b = c, α = β = γ, the reciprocal lattice parameters can be calculated. Let's compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Given the real space vectors a, b, c with |a| = |b| = |c| = a, and angles between any two vectors as α. The volume V is given by:

V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

The reciprocal lattice vectors are:

a* = (b × c) / V

Similarly for b* and c*.

Calculating the magnitude of a*:

|a*| = |b × c| / V

The cross product |b × c| is |b||c| sinα = a² sinα

So |a*| = a² sinα / V

Similarly, the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors (let's denote it as α*) can be found by the dot product:

a* · b* = (b × c) · (c × a) / V²

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors α* is related to the real space angle α. For a rhombohedral system, it's known that the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral with angles α*, where cosα* = [cosα / (1 + cosα)] perhaps? Not sure. Let me check.

Alternatively, using the relation for the reciprocal lattice parameters. For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice parameters can be given by:

a* = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α))

And the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors α* is given by:

cosα* = -cosα / (1 + cosα)

Wait, let me verify this formula. If in real space, the angle is α, then in reciprocal space, the angle α* would be such that:

cosα* = (cosβ cosγ - cosα) / (sinβ sinγ)

But since in rhombohedral, α = β = γ, so:

cosα* = (cos²α - cosα) / sin²α

= [cosα (cosα - 1)] / (1 - cos²α)

= [ -cosα (1 - cosα) ] / (1 - cosα)(1 + cosα)

= -cosα / (1 + cosα)

Therefore, cosα* = -cosα / (1 + cosα)

So that's correct. So in reciprocal space, the angles are α* where cosα* = -cosα / (1 + cosα)

Given that α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Therefore, cosα* = -√3/2 / (1 + √3/2) = -√3/(2 + √3)

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):

cosα* = -√3(2 - √3) / [(2 + √3)(2 - √3)] = -√3(2 - √3) / (4 - 3) = -√3(2 - √3)

Calculating:

√3 ≈ 1.732, so 2 - √3 ≈ 0.2679

Therefore, cosα* ≈ -1.732 * 0.2679 ≈ -0.464

So α* ≈ arccos(-0.464) ≈ 117.7 degrees.

But perhaps I don't need this. Let me return to the reciprocal lattice parameters.

The magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector is |a*| = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α))

Wait, let's compute V first:

V = a³ √(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

Given a = 10 Å, α = 30°, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Compute the term under the square root:

1 - 3*(0.8660)^2 + 2*(0.8660)^3

First, 3*(0.8660)^2: 3*(0.75) = 2.25

Wait, (√3/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So 3*0.75 = 2.25

Then 2*(0.8660)^3: 2*( (√3/2)^3 ) = 2*(3√3/8) = 3√3/4 ≈ 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1.299

Thus, 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 1 - 2.25 = -1.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

Therefore, V = a³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 10^3 * 0.2217 ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³

So V ≈ 221.7 cubic Angstroms.

Now, the reciprocal lattice parameter |a*| = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α))

Compute denominator:

a sinα = 10 * sin(30°) = 10 * 0.5 = 5

sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) = sqrt(0.049) ≈ 0.2217

Thus, denominator ≈ 5 * 0.2217 ≈ 1.1085

Therefore, |a*| ≈ 1 / 1.1085 ≈ 0.902 Å^{-1}

Similarly, the reciprocal lattice vectors have magnitude ~0.902 Å^{-1}

But perhaps this is not directly helpful. Alternatively, the interplanar distance is 1 / |G|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the (hkl) plane.

The reciprocal lattice vector G for (hkl) is given by G = h a* + k b* + l c*

The magnitude |G| is sqrt( G · G )

Compute G · G:

= h² |a*|² + k² |b*|² + l² |c*|² + 2hk a* · b* + 2kl b* · c* + 2hl a* · c*

Since in rhombohedral, |a*| = |b*| = |c*| = 1/d_{100} (for instance)

But given the earlier calculation, |a*| ≈ 0.902 Å^{-1}

Also, the dot product between a* and b* is |a*||b*| cosα*

From before, cosα* = -cosα / (1 + cosα) ≈ -0.8660 / (1 + 0.8660) ≈ -0.8660 / 1.8660 ≈ -0.464

Thus, a* · b* = |a*|² cosα*

Similarly, since |a*| = |b*|, and the angle between a* and b* is α*

Therefore, G · G = |a*|² [ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + hl) cosα* ]

Thus, |G| = |a*| sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + hl) cosα* )

Therefore, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} = 1 / |G| = 1 / [ |a*| sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + hl) cosα* ) ]

But since |a*| = 1 / (a sinα sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)) ), which is 1 / (a sinα sqrt(V / a³)) )

But perhaps substituting |a*| from the earlier calculation.

Given |a*| ≈ 0.902 Å^{-1}, and cosα* ≈ -0.464

So for (111) plane, h = 1, k = 1, l = 1

Thus, the term inside the square root becomes:

1² + 1² + 1² + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*(-0.464) = 3 + 2*(3)*(-0.464) = 3 - 6*0.464 ≈ 3 - 2.784 ≈ 0.216

Therefore, |G| ≈ 0.902 * sqrt(0.216) ≈ 0.902 * 0.465 ≈ 0.419 Å^{-1}

Thus, d_{111} = 1 / 0.419 ≈ 2.387 Å

But wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. But this result is around 2.387 Å, which is much smaller. That can't be right. There must be an error in the calculation.

Wait, but the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which is the edge length a. But according to the calculation, the interplanar distance for (111) is ~2.4 Angstroms, which is smaller than a. However, in cubic systems, d_{111} is a / sqrt(3), which for a=10Å would be ~5.77Å. So if the rhombohedral is a distorted cubic with angles 30°, the interplanar distance would be different, but getting 2.4Å seems too small.

Possibly, I made a mistake in the reciprocal lattice parameters. Let's re-examine the steps.

First, the volume V was calculated as a³ * sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α). With a=10Å, α=30°, cosα=√3/2≈0.866.

Compute 1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α:

1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )^3

= 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3/8)

= (4/4 - 9/4) + (6√3)/8

= (-5/4) + (3√3)/4

≈ (-1.25) + (5.196)/4

≈ (-1.25) + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

Thus, V = 10³ * sqrt(0.049) ≈ 1000 * 0.2217 ≈ 221.7 Å³. That seems correct.

Then, |a*| = (a² sinα)/V

Wait, earlier I thought |a*| = |b × c| / V = (a² sinα) / V

But |a*| is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector, which is 1 / (interplanar distance d_{100}), but in a rhombohedral system, the (100) planes aren't orthogonal, so perhaps this interpretation is not straightforward.

Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vector magnitude |a*| is 1 / (d_{100} sinθ), where θ is the angle between the vector and the plane. But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a triclinic system, which is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ h² a² b² c² (1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cosα cosβ cosγ ) + ... ]

But given that in the rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ, this formula simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula from the International Tables for Crystallography.

Upon checking, the formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system (trigonal) is given by:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos²α - cosα) ] / [ a²(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ]

Wait, perhaps rearranged. Let me confirm.

Alternatively, referring to the following formula from literature:

For a rhombohedral lattice with parameters a and α, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] / (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) )

Thus, putting it all together:

d_{hkl} = a * sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] )

Given that, substituting the values:

a = 10 Å

α = 30°, so sinα = 0.5, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

h = k = l = 1

Compute numerator inside the sqrt:

1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α ≈ 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049

Denominator inside the sqrt:

(1² + 1² + 1²) sin²α + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)(cosα - cos²α)

= 3*(0.25) + 2*3*(0.8660 - 0.75)

= 0.75 + 6*(0.1160)

= 0.75 + 0.696 ≈ 1.446

Therefore, the entire sqrt term is sqrt(0.049 / 1.446) ≈ sqrt(0.0339) ≈ 0.184

Thus, d_{111} = 10 * 0.184 ≈ 1.84 Å

But this is even smaller than before. Wait, this can't be correct either. The interatomic distance is 10 Å, so planes shouldn't be 1.84 Å apart. This suggests a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe I inverted numerator and denominator. Let me check the formula again.

If the formula is d_{hkl} = a * sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ (h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α) ] )

But 0.049 / 1.446 ≈ 0.0339, sqrt of that is ~0.184. So 10 * 0.184 = 1.84 Å. But this is still too small. There must be a miscalculation here.

Wait, let's recompute the denominator:

Denominator:

(h² + k² + l²) sin²α + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cosα - cos²α)

For hkl = 111:

= (1 + 1 + 1) * (0.5)^2 + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)*(0.8660 - 0.75)

= 3 * 0.25 + 2*3*(0.116)

= 0.75 + 6*0.116

= 0.75 + 0.696 = 1.446. This is correct.

Numerator:

1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α ≈ 1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) ≈ 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 ≈ 0.049. Correct.

Therefore, 0.049 / 1.446 ≈ 0.0339, sqrt ≈ 0.184, so d ≈ 1.84 Å. However, this seems unphysical given the interatomic distance is 10 Å. So either the formula is incorrect, or my application is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the formula from the rhombohedral system expressed in terms of hexagonal axes. Let me try that approach.

In the hexagonal setting, a rhombohedral lattice can be described with a hexagonal unit cell, where a_hex = 2a_rhomb * sin(α/2), c_hex = a_rhomb * sqrt(3 - 12 sin²(α/2))

But this might not be necessary. Alternatively, the interplanar distance in the hexagonal system is given by:

1/d² = 4/(3 a_hex²) (h² + hk + k²) + (l²)/(c_hex²)

But this is for the hexagonal system. However, since the rhombohedral can be expressed in hexagonal axes, perhaps converting the (111) rhombohedral indices to hexagonal indices.

Wait, in the rhombohedral to hexagonal transformation, the indices (hkl) in rhombohedral correspond to (h - k, k - l, h + k + l) in hexagonal? Not sure. Let me check.

Alternatively, the Miller indices in the rhombohedral and hexagonal systems are related by a transformation matrix. For the rhombohedral to hexagonal setting, the basis vectors are different. The hexagonal unit cell contains three rhombohedral unit cells.

But maybe this complicates things further. Let's try another approach.

Suppose we model the rhombohedral lattice as a simple trigonal lattice with a = b = c = 10 Å, α = β = γ = 30°. The (111) planes are the planes that intercept all three axes at 1 unit each. The distance between such planes can be calculated using the formula for a general lattice.

Alternatively, using the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. For a general triclinic lattice, the formula is:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ S11 h² + S22 k² + S33 l² + 2S12 hk + 2S23 kl + 2S13 hl ]

Where S11 = b²c² sin²α

S22 = a²c² sin²β

S33 = a²b² sin²γ

S12 = a b c² (cosα cosβ - cosγ)

S23 = a² b c (cosβ cosγ - cosα)

S13 = a b² c (cosγ cosα - cosβ)

But in the rhombohedral case, a = b = c, α = β = γ, so S11 = S22 = S33 = a^4 sin²α

Similarly, S12 = S23 = S13 = a^4 (cos²α - cosα)

Therefore, substituting into the formula:

1/d² = (1/V²) [ a^4 sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a^4 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + kl + hl) ]

Factor out a^4:

1/d² = a^4 / V² [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + kl + hl) ]

But V = a³ sqrt(1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α), so V² = a^6 (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α)

Therefore,

1/d² = a^4 / [a^6 (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ] [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + kl + hl) ]

Simplify:

1/d² = 1 / [a² (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) ] [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + kl + hl) ]

Therefore,

d = a sqrt( (1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α) / [ sin²α (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (cos²α - cosα)(hk + kl + hl) ] )

Which is the same formula as before. So substituting the values:

a = 10 Å

α = 30°, so sinα = 0.5, cosα = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

h = k = l = 1

Compute numerator inside the sqrt:

1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) ≈ 0.049

Denominator inside the sqrt:

sin²α*(3) + 2*(cos²α - cosα)*(3)

= 0.25*3 + 2*(0.75 - 0.8660)*3

= 0.75 + 2*(-0.116)*3

= 0.75 - 0.696 ≈ 0.054

Therefore, the ratio is 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907

Thus, d = 10 * sqrt(0.907) ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

Wait, now this is a different result. Previously, the denominator was calculated as 1.446, but here it's 0.054. What's the discrepancy?

Wait, no. Wait, in the denominator here:

sin²α*(h² + k² + l²) + 2*(cos²α - cosα)*(hk + kl + hl)

= sin²α*3 + 2*(cos²α - cosα)*3

= 3*sin²α + 6*(cos²α - cosα)

But sin²α = 0.25, cos²α = 0.75, cosα = 0.8660

So:

3*0.25 + 6*(0.75 - 0.8660)

= 0.75 + 6*(-0.116)

= 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054

Yes, correct.

But numerator is 0.049, so 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907

Thus, sqrt(0.907) ≈ 0.952, so d ≈ 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

This is a more reasonable value, given the interatomic distance is 10 Å. So 9.52 Å for the (111) interplanar distance. But let me verify this again.

Wait, this suggests that the interplanar distance is almost equal to the lattice parameter. For a cubic system, d_{111} = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 5.77 Å for a=10 Å, but in this rhombohedral system with angles 30°, it's ~9.52 Å. That seems plausible if the planes are more spaced out due to the acute angles.

But let's cross-validate this. Suppose the rhombohedron is a cube compressed along the space diagonal, making angles 30°. The (111) planes are perpendicular to the space diagonal. The distance between these planes would be the length of the space diagonal divided by the number of planes. For a cube, the space diagonal is a√3, and there are planes spaced at intervals of a√3 / d_{111} = integer. For the cubic (111), d_{111} = a / √3. But in this case, the space diagonal is different.

Wait, the length of the space diagonal in a rhombohedron with edge length a and angle α between edges is given by:

d = a sqrt(3 + 6 cosα)

For α = 30°, cosα = √3/2, so:

d = a sqrt(3 + 6*(√3/2)) = a sqrt(3 + 3√3)

≈ a sqrt(3 + 5.196) ≈ a sqrt(8.196) ≈ a * 2.864

For a=10Å, d ≈ 28.64 Å

If the (111) planes are perpendicular to this space diagonal, the interplanar distance would be d / n, where n is the number of planes. For (111), n=1, so d_{111} = |space diagonal| / |(111) reciprocal vector| ?

Wait, this is not straightforward. Alternatively, if the (111) planes are spaced along the space diagonal, the interplanar distance would be the projection of the lattice vector onto the space diagonal direction. Suppose a lattice vector along the space diagonal is (a, a, a). The length of this vector is sqrt(a² + a² + a² + 2a² cosα + 2a² cosα + 2a² cosα) = sqrt(3a² + 6a² cosα) = a sqrt(3 + 6 cosα). Which is the space diagonal length.

The interplanar distance d_{hkl} is equal to the spacing between planes, which for (hkl) is given by the formula we derived. If the formula gives ~9.52 Å, then the space diagonal is ~28.64 Å, which is about 3 times the interplanar distance. So 28.64 / 3 ≈ 9.55 Å, which aligns with our previous result. Therefore, this seems plausible. The three interplanar distances would span the space diagonal.

Therefore, the interplanar distance for (111) in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.52 Å. Rounding to two decimal places, 9.5 Å. However, let's check the exact calculation.

Numerator inside sqrt: 1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α

= 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*( (√3)/2 )^3

= 1 - 9/4 + 2*(3√3)/8

= (4/4 - 9/4) + (6√3)/8

= (-5/4) + (3√3)/4

= [ -5 + 3√3 ] / 4

Numerical value:

3√3 ≈ 5.196, so -5 + 5.196 ≈ 0.196, divided by 4 ≈ 0.049

Denominator inside sqrt:

sin²α*(h² + k² + l²) + 2*(cos²α - cosα)*(hk + kl + hl)

= (1/4)*3 + 2*(3/4 - √3/2)*3

= 3/4 + 2*( (3 - 2√3)/4 )*3

= 3/4 + (6 - 4√3)/4 *3

Wait, let's compute step by step:

cos²α - cosα = 3/4 - √3/2 ≈ 0.75 - 0.866 ≈ -0.116

Multiply by 2: 2*(-0.116) = -0.232

Multiply by (hk + kl + hl) = 3: -0.232*3 ≈ -0.696

Add sin²α*(h² + k² + l²) = 0.25*3 = 0.75

Total denominator inside sqrt: 0.75 - 0.696 = 0.054

So ratio = 0.049 / 0.054 ≈ 0.907

Therefore, sqrt(0.907) ≈ 0.952

Thus, d = 10 * 0.952 ≈ 9.52 Å

Therefore, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.5 Angstroms. Given the problem states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which is the edge length, this result makes sense, as the (111) planes are spaced nearly the full edge length apart, which is reasonable given the acute angles causing the planes to be further separated compared to a cubic system.

Therefore, the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.5 Angstroms. Rounding to two significant figures, since the given interatomic distance is 10 (one significant figure?), but maybe it's two, 10.0? The answer would be approximately 9.5 Å. But let me check the exact calculation once more.

Alternatively, using exact terms:

Numerator inside sqrt:

1 - 3cos²α + 2cos³α = 1 - 3*(√3/2)^2 + 2*(√3/2)^3

= 1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(3√3/8)

= 1 - 9/4 + 3√3/4

= (4/4 - 9/4) + 3√3/4

= (-5/4) + (3√3)/4

= ( -5 + 3√3 ) / 4

Denominator inside sqrt:

sin²α*(h² + k² + l²) + 2*(cos²α - cosα)*(hk + kl + hl)

= (1/2)^2*3 + 2*( (√3/2)^2 - √3/2 )*3

= (1/4)*3 + 2*( (3/4 - √3/2 ))*3

= 3/4 + 2*(3/4 - √3/2)*3

= 3/4 + (3/2 - √3)*3

= 3/4 + 9/2 - 3√3

Convert to quarters:

3/4 + 18/4 - 12√3/4

= (21/4 - 12√3/4 )

= (21 - 12√3)/4

Therefore, the ratio is:

( -5 + 3√3 ) / 4 divided by (21 - 12√3)/4

= ( -5 + 3√3 ) / (21 - 12√3 )

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (21 + 12√3):

[ (-5 + 3√3)(21 + 12√3) ] / [ (21)^2 - (12√3)^2 ]

Compute numerator:

= -5*21 + (-5)*12√3 + 3√3*21 + 3√3*12√3

= -105 - 60√3 + 63√3 + 36*3

= -105 + 3√3 + 108

= 3 + 3√3

Denominator:

441 - 432*3

= 441 - 1296

= -855

Thus, ratio = (3 + 3√3)/(-855) = - (3(1 + √3)) / 855 ≈ - (3*2.732)/855 ≈ -8.196/855 ≈ -0.00958

But this is negative, which cannot be, as we are taking the square root. There must be a miscalculation.

Wait, but earlier numerical calculation gave a positive ratio. Where is the error here?

Wait, when we computed the numerator and denominator symbols:

Numerator: ( -5 + 3√3 ) ≈ -5 + 5.196 ≈ 0.196

Denominator: (21 - 12√3) ≈ 21 - 20.78 ≈ 0.22

So 0.196 / 0.22 ≈ 0.89, which is positive. However, in the exact calculation, after multiplying numerator and denominator by (21 + 12√3), the numerator became (3 + 3√3) and denominator became -855. But 3 + 3√3 ≈ 3 + 5.196 ≈ 8.196, so 8.196 / (-855) ≈ -0.00958, but this contradicts the approximate calculation. Hence, there must be an error in the exact calculation.

Wait, let's redo the exact multiplication:

Numerator: (-5 + 3√3)(21 + 12√3)

= (-5)(21) + (-5)(12√3) + (3√3)(21) + (3√3)(12√3)

= -105 - 60√3 + 63√3 + 36*3

= -105 + 3√3 + 108

= ( -105 + 108 ) + 3√3

= 3 + 3√3

Denominator: (21)^2 - (12√3)^2 = 441 - (144 * 3) = 441 - 432 = 9

Wait, this is different from before. I previously miscalculated the denominator.

Correct denominator: 21² - (12√3)² = 441 - 144*3 = 441 - 432 = 9

Therefore, ratio = (3 + 3√3)/9 = (1 + √3)/3 ≈ (1 + 1.732)/3 ≈ 2.732/3 ≈ 0.9106

Thus, sqrt(0.9106) ≈ 0.954

Therefore, d = 10 * 0.954 ≈ 9.54 Å

Which matches our approximate calculation earlier. Therefore, the interplanar distance is approximately 9.54 Angstroms. Considering significant figures, the given interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms (one significant figure), but angles are given as 30° (two significant figures). However, since the answer came out to ~9.5, which is two significant figures, it's appropriate to present it as 9.5 Angstroms.

But let's use the exact symbolic expression:

d = 10 * sqrt( ( -5 + 3√3 ) / (21 - 12√3) )

But since we rationalized it to (1 + √3)/3, then:

sqrt( (1 + √3)/3 ) = sqrt( (1 + 1.732)/3 ) = sqrt(2.732/3 ) ≈ sqrt(0.9106) ≈ 0.954

Thus, d ≈ 9.54 Å, which rounds to 9.5 Å or 9.54 Å depending on precision.

Therefore, the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in this rhombohedral crystal is approximately 9.5 Angstroms.

**Final Answer**
The interplanar distance of the (111) plane is \boxed{9.5} Angstroms.
