# Original Question

Consider two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum state. Ignoring there spin angular momentum, the coupled angular momentum state of the 2-electron system is represented by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1, 2, -1>. Here, $l_1, l_2$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of particles 1 and 2 respectively. And, $l, m$ are the total angular momentum quantum number and the corresponding Z component of the 2-electron system respectively. If measurement is made of the orbital angular momentum components $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, what is the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$?

To determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \(-\hbar\) for the coupled angular momentum state \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\), we need to express this state in terms of the uncoupled basis states \(|m_1, m_2\rangle\).

1. **Coupled State Expansion**:
   The coupled state \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\) is part of the total angular momentum \(l = 2\) multiplet. The possible values of \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) (each ranging from -1, 0, +1 for \(l = 1\)) must satisfy \(m_1 + m_2 = -1\). The valid combinations are \((-1, 0)\) and \((0, -1)\).

2. **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**:
   Using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two \(l = 1\) states into a total \(l = 2\) state, we find that the state \(|2, -1\rangle\) is a symmetric combination of the uncoupled states \(|-1, 0\rangle\) and \(|0, -1\rangle\). The specific expansion is:
   \[
   |2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |-1, 0\rangle + |0, -1\rangle \right)
   \]

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   The joint probability of measuring both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\) corresponds to the coefficient of the \(|-1, -1\rangle\) term in the expansion. However, this term is not present in the expansion of \(|2, -1\rangle\). Therefore, the coefficient for \(|-1, -1\rangle\) is zero.

4. **Conclusion**:
   The joint probability of both eigenvalues being \(-\hbar\) is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient for \(|-1, -1\rangle\), which is zero.

\[
\boxed{0}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step. The question is about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. We're supposed to ignore their spin angular momentum, which probably simplifies things because we don't have to consider the total angular momentum including spin. The coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system is given as |1, 1, 2, -1⟩. Here, l₁ and l₂ are both 1 (since they're in p orbitals), and the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. 

The question is asking: if we measure the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z (the z-components for each electron), what's the probability that both eigenvalues are -ħ? So we need to find the joint probability that measuring L₁z gives -ħ and L₂z also gives -ħ.

First, I need to recall how coupled angular momentum states relate to uncoupled states. The given state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ is a coupled state, meaning it's a combination of the individual angular momenta of the two electrons. To find the probability of specific individual measurements (L₁z and L₂z), we need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states |l₁, m₁⟩ ⊗ |l₂, m₂⟩. Once we have that expansion, the coefficients squared will give the probabilities for each combination of m₁ and m₂.

So the plan is:

1. Find the expansion of the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ in terms of the uncoupled basis states |m₁, m₂⟩.
2. Identify the coefficient corresponding to m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1.
3. The square of the absolute value of that coefficient will be the joint probability.

To do this, I need to remember how Clebsch-Gordan coefficients work. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are the coefficients that relate the coupled states |l1, l2, l, m⟩ to the uncoupled states |l1, m1⟩ |l2, m2⟩. The total m is m1 + m2. So for our case, since the total m is -1, we need all combinations of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. The possible m values for each electron (since they are p orbitals, l=1) are -1, 0, +1. So the possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are:

- (-1, 0)
- (0, -1)

Wait, but wait. Let's check. If m1 + m2 = -1, then possible pairs are:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1; same for m2.

So possible pairs:

If m1 = -1, then m2 = 0 (since -1 + 0 = -1)

If m1 = 0, then m2 = -1

If m1 = +1, then m2 = -2, but m2 can't be -2 because m2 is limited to -1, 0, +1. So only two possible combinations: (-1, 0) and (0, -1). 

Therefore, the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ should be a linear combination of the uncoupled states |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩. However, wait, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2 here. The coupled state with l=2 and m=-1 is part of the l=2 multiplet. When combining two l=1 states, the possible total l values are 2, 1, 0. So for l=2, m can range from -2 to +2. But here we have m=-1, so that's within the l=2 manifold.

So the expansion coefficients for |l=2, m=-1⟩ in terms of the uncoupled states will involve the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into a total l=2, m=-1. The possible m1 and m2 are as we discussed, (-1,0) and (0,-1). The coefficients for these can be found using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients formula.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Since the two electrons are identical particles, but the problem doesn't mention anything about antisymmetrizing the state, which is odd because electrons are fermions and their total wavefunction (including spin) must be antisymmetric. However, the problem says to ignore their spin angular momentum, so maybe we're only considering the spatial part, and perhaps the spin part is considered separately. But since we're ignoring spin, maybe we don't have to worry about antisymmetrization here. The problem might be treating the electrons as distinguishable for the sake of this problem, which is a common approximation when spin is ignored. So perhaps we can proceed without worrying about antisymmetry.

Therefore, proceed to find the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1⟩.

The formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be complicated, but there are tables or known values. Alternatively, we can use ladder operators to construct the state.

But maybe I can recall that for combining two l=1 states, the states with total l=2 are symmetric under exchange, and the l=1 states are antisymmetric, and l=0 is symmetric. But since we're dealing with l=2, the state should be symmetric.

But I need the specific coefficients. Let me recall that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1 and l2=1 to get l=2, m=-1.

Alternatively, perhaps start from the highest weight state |l=2, m=2⟩, which is |m1=1, m2=1⟩. Then apply the lowering operator to get the other states.

The lowering operator J- = L1- ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ L2-.

So starting with |2, 2⟩ = |1,1⟩ ⊗ |1,1⟩.

Apply J-:

J- |2, 2⟩ = (L1- |1,1⟩) ⊗ |1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩ ⊗ (L2- |1,1⟩)

L1- |1,1⟩ = ħ√(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,0⟩ = ħ√(2) |1,0⟩

Similarly for L2-. So:

J- |2,2⟩ = ħ√2 |1,0⟩ ⊗ |1,1⟩ + ħ√2 |1,1⟩ ⊗ |1,0⟩

Divide both sides by ħ to get the normalized state:

|2,1⟩ = (1/√2)( |1,0⟩⊗|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩⊗|1,0⟩ )

Similarly, apply J- again to get |2,0⟩.

But maybe it's easier to look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Alternatively, I can use recursion relations.

Alternatively, use the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients:

⟨m1, m2 | l, m⟩ = ... but the formula is a bit involved. However, for l=2, m=-1, l1=1, l2=1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m1 + m2 = m = -1. So m1 and m2 can be (-1,0) and (0,-1). The coefficients for these two terms.

The formula is:

⟨m1, m2 | l, m⟩ = sqrt( ( (2l + 1) / ( (l1 + l2 + 1) ) ) * ... ) )

Wait, no, the general formula is complicated, but for specific cases, there are known coefficients. Let me check standard CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1.

From tables, for example, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states to get l=2.

For l=2, m=-1:

The possible m1 and m2 pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). The coefficients should be sqrt(2/2*1 +1) ??? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, using symmetry. Since the state |l=2, m=1⟩ is symmetric in m1 and m2, and when we lower it to m=-1, it should maintain the same symmetry. Wait, but actually, when we lower from m=2 to m=1, we saw that |2,1⟩ is a symmetric combination of |1,0⟩ and |0,1⟩. Similarly, continuing to lower, when we get to |2,-1⟩, it should be a symmetric combination of | -1,0⟩ and |0,-1⟩. But wait, no, when we lower from |2,1⟩ to |2,0⟩, etc., the coefficients may change.

Alternatively, let's actually compute it.

Starting from |2,2⟩ = |1,1⟩|1,1⟩

Apply J- to get |2,1⟩:

J-|2,2> = (L1- + L2-)|1,1>|1,1> = L1-|1,1>|1,1> + |1,1>L2-|1,1>

As before, L1-|1,1> = √2 ħ |1,0>, similarly for L2-.

Thus,

J-|2,2> = √2 ħ |1,0>|1,1> + √2 ħ |1,1>|1,0>

Divide by ħ and then divide by √( (√2)^2 + (√2)^2 ) = √(2 + 2) = √4 = 2. Wait, no. Wait, when we apply J- to |2,2>, we get:

J-|2,2> = ħ√(2(2+1) - 2(2-1)) |2,1> = ħ√(6 - 2) |2,1> = ħ√4 |2,1> = 2ħ |2,1>

But also, computing via the components:

J-|2,2> = √2 ħ (|1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> )

Therefore,

2ħ |2,1> = √2 ħ ( |1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> )

Divide both sides by ħ:

2 |2,1> = √2 ( |1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> )

Therefore,

|2,1> = (√2 / 2) ( |1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> ) = (1/√2)( |1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> )

Similarly, to get |2,0>, apply J- again.

J-|2,1> = (L1- + L2-)|2,1>

First, compute L1- acting on each term:

L1- |1,0>|1,1> = (L1-|1,0>) ⊗ |1,1> = √(1(1+1) - 0(0-1)) |1,-1> |1,1> = √2 |1,-1> |1,1>

Similarly, L1- |1,1>|1,0> = (L1-|1,1>) ⊗ |1,0> = √2 |1,0> |1,0>

Similarly, L2- acting on each term:

L2- |1,0>|1,1> = |1,0> ⊗ (L2-|1,1>) = √2 |1,0> |1,0>

L2- |1,1>|1,0> = |1,1> ⊗ (L2-|1,0>) = √2 |1,1> |1,-1>

Therefore, J-|2,1> = √2 |1,-1>|1,1> + √2 |1,0>|1,0> + √2 |1,0>|1,0> + √2 |1,1>|1,-1>

Combine like terms:

= √2 |1,-1>|1,1> + 2√2 |1,0>|1,0> + √2 |1,1>|1,-1>

But also, J-|2,1> should equal ħ√(2(2+1) -1(1-1)) |2,0> = ħ√(6 - 0) |2,0> = ħ√6 |2,0>

Therefore:

√2 |1,-1>|1,1> + 2√2 |1,0>|1,0> + √2 |1,1>|1,-1> = ħ√6 |2,0>

Divide both sides by ħ:

√2 |1,-1>|1,1> + 2√2 |1,0>|1,0> + √2 |1,1>|1,-1> = √6 |2,0>

Therefore,

|2,0> = (1/√6)( √2 |1,-1>|1,1> + 2√2 |1,0>|1,0> + √2 |1,1>|1,-1> )

Simplify:

= (1/√6)( √2 [ |1,-1>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,-1> ] + 2√2 |1,0>|1,0> )

Factor out √2:

= (√2 / √6)( [ |1,-1>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,-1> ] + 2 |1,0>|1,0> )

Simplify √2 / √6 = 1/√3:

= (1/√3)( [ |1,-1>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,-1> ] + 2 |1,0>|1,0> )

This is the state |2,0⟩.

Continuing this process, we can find |2,-1⟩ by applying J- to |2,0⟩.

But this is getting tedious. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each time we lower, we get symmetric combinations. For |2,1⟩, it's symmetric in m1 and m2. For |2,0⟩, it's symmetric combinations as well. So likely, |2,-1⟩ will be symmetric in the same way as |2,1⟩ but with m's shifted down by 2.

Wait, but let's try to compute it.

Starting from |2,0⟩, apply J- to get |2,-1⟩.

Compute J-|2,0> = (L1- + L2-)|2,0>

First, express |2,0> as (1/√3)( [ |1,-1>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,-1> ] + 2 |1,0>|1,0> )

Apply L1- + L2- term by term.

First term: L1- |1,-1>|1,1>:

L1- |1,-1> = √(1(1+1) - (-1)(-1-1)) |1,-2⟩. Wait, but wait, m1 can't be -2 because l=1. Wait, m1 for l=1 can only be -1,0,1. So L1- |1,-1> = 0 because m1 can't go lower. Similarly, L2- |1,1> = √2 |1,0> as before. Wait, no, in this term, the first part is |1,-1> and the second is |1,1>. So applying L1- to |1,-1> gives zero, and applying L2- to |1,1> gives √2 |1,0>. So:

L1- |1,-1>|1,1> = 0 |1,-2>|1,1> = 0

L2- |1,-1>|1,1> = |1,-1> (L2-|1,1>) = |1,-1> √2 |1,0>

Similarly, the term |1,1>|1,-1>:

L1- |1,1>|1,-1> = (L1-|1,1>) |1,-1> = √2 |1,0> |1,-1>

L2- |1,1>|1,-1> = |1,1> (L2-|1,-1>) = |1,1> * 0 = 0

Third term: 2 |1,0>|1,0>

Apply L1- + L2-:

L1- |1,0>|1,0> = (L1-|1,0>) |1,0> = √(1(1+1) - 0(0-1)) |1,-1> |1,0> = √2 |1,-1> |1,0>

Similarly, L2- |1,0>|1,0> = |1,0> (L2-|1,0>) = √2 |1,0> |1,-1>

Therefore, putting it all together:

J-|2,0> = [0 + |1,-1> √2 |1,0> ] + [ √2 |1,0> |1,-1> + 0 ] + 2 [ √2 |1,-1> |1,0> + √2 |1,0> |1,-1> ]

Simplify each part:

First term from first part: √2 |1,-1>|1,0>

Second term from second part: √2 |1,0>|1,-1>

Third term: 2*(√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + √2 |1,0>|1,-1>) = 2√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 2√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

So total:

√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + √2 |1,0>|1,-1> + 2√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 2√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

Combine like terms:

(√2 + 2√2)|1,-1>|1,0> + (√2 + 2√2)|1,0>|1,-1> = 3√2 |1,-1>|1,0> + 3√2 |1,0>|1,-1>

Factor out 3√2:

3√2 ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

But also, J-|2,0> = ħ√(2(2+1) - 0(0-1)) |2,-1> = ħ√6 |2,-1>

Therefore:

3√2 ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) = ħ√6 |2,-1>

Divide both sides by ħ:

3√2 ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) = √6 |2,-1>

Divide both sides by √6:

(3√2 / √6) ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) = |2,-1>

Simplify 3√2 / √6 = 3 / √3 = √3

Therefore:

|2,-1> = √3 ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> ) / √6 ?

Wait, wait. Let me check the math again.

Wait, 3√2 / √6 = 3√2 / (√2 * √3) ) = 3 / √3 = √3.

Yes, so:

|2,-1> = √3 / √6 * ( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

But √3 / √6 = 1/√2.

Therefore,

|2,-1> = (1/√2)( |1,-1>|1,0> + |1,0>|1,-1> )

Wait, that seems similar to the |2,1> state, which was (1/√2)( |1,0>|1,1> + |1,1>|1,0> )

Yes, symmetric combinations. So |2,-1> is the symmetric combination of | -1,0 ⟩ and |0,-1 ⟩.

Therefore, the expansion of |2,-1> in the uncoupled basis is:

|2,-1> = (1/√2)( | -1,0 ⟩ + |0,-1 ⟩ )

Therefore, the coefficients for m1=-1 and m2=0 is 1/√2, and for m1=0 and m2=-1 is also 1/√2. The other terms (like m1=-1 and m2=-1) are not present in the expansion.

But the question is asking for the joint probability of both m1 and m2 being -1. However, looking at the expansion, there is no term with m1=-1 and m2=-1. The possible terms are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Therefore, the coefficient for m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero.

Wait, but let me confirm. The coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is expanded as (1/√2)( | -1,0 ⟩ + |0,-1 ⟩ ). There is no | -1,-1 ⟩ term. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ (i.e., m1=-1 and m2=-1) is zero.

But wait, the total m is -1. If m1 and m2 are both -1, their sum is -2, which would correspond to a state with total m=-2. But our coupled state has m=-1, so it cannot have any component with m=-2. Therefore, indeed, there is no | -1,-1 ⟩ term in the expansion of |2,-1⟩. Hence, the probability is zero.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again. Maybe there is a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, when we derived |2,-1>, we applied the lowering operator to |2,0> and got |2,-1> as (1/√2)( | -1,0 ⟩ + |0,-1 ⟩ ). This seems correct because the process of lowering maintains the symmetric combinations. So if we started from |2,2> which is |1,1⟩|1,1⟩, and each lowering adds symmetric combinations with one unit less in m. So yes, |2,-1> should be symmetric combination of the two possible ways to get m=-1: (-1,0) and (0,-1). Therefore, indeed, the coefficient for (-1,-1) is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero.

But wait, the problem says "the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ". Since ħ is the unit here, the eigenvalues are mħ. So if m1=-1, then L₁z = -ħ, similarly for m2=-1. But in the state |2,-1>, there are no components where both m1 and m2 are -1. Therefore, the probability is zero.

Hence, the answer is 0.

But to be thorough, let me check another approach. The state |l=2, m=-1> must be orthogonal to the states with other l values (like l=1 and l=0) but same m. However, since we are only considering l=2 here, and we've expanded it in terms of the uncoupled basis, and there's no (-1,-1) term, the probability is indeed zero.

Alternatively, think about the possible total angular momentum states. For two p electrons (l1=l2=1), the total angular momentum can be l=2,1,0. The state with l=2, m=-1 cannot include the m1=-1 and m2=-1 combination because that would require m = -2, which is only possible for l=2, m=-2. But our state is m=-1, so it's a different m. Therefore, the state |2,-1> cannot have any contribution from | -1,-1 ⟩.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero.

**Final Answer**
The joint probability is \boxed{0}.

# Cut off deepseek reasoning

Alright, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step. The question is about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. We're supposed to ignore their spin angular momentum, which probably simplifies things because we don't have to consider the total angular momentum including spin. The coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system is given as |1, 1, 2, -1⟩. Here, l₁ and l₂ are both 1 (since they're in p orbitals), and the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. 

The question is asking: if we measure the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z (the z-components for each electron), what's the probability that both eigenvalues are -ħ? So we need to find the joint probability that measuring L₁z gives -ħ and L₂z also gives -ħ.

First, I need to recall how coupled angular momentum states relate to uncoupled states. The given state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ is a coupled state, meaning it's a combination of the individual angular momenta of the two electrons. To find the probability of specific individual measurements (L₁z and L₂z), we need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states |l₁, m₁⟩ ⊗ |l₂, m₂⟩. Once we have that expansion, the coefficients squared will give the probabilities for each combination of m₁ and m₂.

So the plan is:

1. Find the expansion of the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ in terms of the uncoupled basis states |m₁, m₂⟩.
2. Identify the coefficient corresponding to m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1.
3. The square of the absolute value of that coefficient will be the joint probability.

To do this, I need to remember how Clebsch-Gordan coefficients work. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are the coefficients that relate the coupled states |l1, l2, l, m⟩ to the uncoupled states |l1, m1⟩ |l2, m2⟩. The total m is m1 + m2. So for our case, since the total m is -1, we need all combinations of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. The possible m values for each electron (since they are p orbitals, l=1) are -1, 0, +1. So the possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to -1 are:

- (-1, 0)
- (0, -1)

Wait, but wait. Let's check. If m1 + m2 = -1, then possible pairs are:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1; same for m2.

So possible pairs:

If m1 = -1, then m2 = 0 (since -1 + 0 = -1)

If m1 = 0, then m2 = -1

If m1 = +1, then m2 = -2, but m2 can't be -2 because m2 is limited to -1, 0, +1. So only two possible combinations: (-1, 0) and (0, -1). 

Therefore, the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ should be a linear combination of the uncoupled states |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩. However, wait, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2 here. The coupled state with l=2 and m=-1 is part of the l=2 multiplet. When combining two l=1 states, the possible total l values are 2, 1, 0. So for l=2, m can range from -2 to +2. But here we have m=-1, so that's within the l=2 manifold.

So the expansion coefficients for |l=2, m=-1⟩ in terms of the uncoupled states will involve the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into a total l=2, m=-1. The possible m1 and m2 are as we discussed, (-1,0) and (0,-1). The coefficients for these can be found using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients formula.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry here. Since the two electrons are identical particles, but the problem doesn't mention anything about antisymmetrizing the state, which is odd because electrons are fermions and their total wavefunction (including spin) must be antisymmetric. However, the problem says to ignore

# Anthropic completion

In this quantum mechanics problem, I'm analyzing a scenario involving two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. I need to examine it systematically. The problem concerns two electrons with their spin angular momentum being disregarded, which likely makes the analysis more straightforward since total angular momentum excluding spin is our focus. The coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system is specified as |1, 1, 2, -1⟩. Both l₁ and l₂ equal 1 (as expected for p orbitals), while the total angular momentum quantum numbers are given as l=2 and m=-1.

The question requires determining the probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z (the z-components of orbital angular momentum for each electron) and obtaining -ħ for both eigenvalues. I need to calculate the joint probability of these specific measurement outcomes.

To approach this, I need to understand how coupled angular momentum states relate to uncoupled states. The state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ represents a coupled state that combines the individual angular momenta of both electrons. To determine the probability of specific L₁z and L₂z measurements, I must express this coupled state using the uncoupled basis states |l₁, m₁⟩ ⊗ |l₂, m₂⟩. The squared coefficients in this expansion will provide the probabilities for different m₁ and m₂ combinations.

My strategy involves:
1. Expanding the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ in terms of uncoupled basis states |m₁, m₂⟩
2. Identifying the coefficient for the case where m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1
3. Calculating the squared absolute value of this coefficient to find the joint probability

This requires applying Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, which connect coupled states |l1, l2, l, m⟩ to uncoupled states |l1, m1⟩ |l2, m2⟩. Since the total m equals -1, I need all m1 and m2 combinations where m1 + m2 = -1. For p orbitals (l=1), each electron's possible m values are -1, 0, and +1.

Analyzing potential pairs where m1 + m2 = -1:
- When m1 = -1, m2 must be 0
- When m1 = 0, m2 must be -1
- When m1 = +1, m2 would need to be -2, which is impossible since m2 is restricted to -1, 0, or +1

Therefore, only two combinations work: (-1, 0) and (0, -1). The coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ must be a linear combination of the uncoupled states |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ and |m1=0, m2=-1⟩.

It's important to note that the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2 here. When combining two l=1 states, possible total l values are 0, 1, and 2. For l=2, m can range from -2 to +2, so m=-1 falls within this range. The expansion coefficients for |l=2, m=-1⟩ in terms of uncoupled states will involve Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into a total l=2, m=-1 state.

Alright, I have a quantum mechanics problem involving two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. Let's break it down step by step. We need to disregard their spin angular momentum, which simplifies the task since we don't have to consider the total angular momentum with spin. The coupled angular momentum state for the two-electron system is represented as |1, 1, 2, -1⟩. Here, both l₁ and l₂ are 1 because they're in p orbitals, and the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1.

The question asks about the probability that when measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z (the z-components for each electron), both eigenvalues are -ħ. Our goal is to find the joint probability that both L₁z and L₂z yield -ħ upon measurement.

First, I need to recall the relationship between coupled and uncoupled angular momentum states. Since |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ is a coupled state, it combines the individual angular momenta of the two electrons. To find specific measurement probabilities for L₁z and L₂z, we need to express this coupled state with uncoupled basis states |l₁, m₁⟩ ⊗ |l₂, m₂⟩. The coefficients of this expansion squared will give the probabilities for each pair of m₁ and m₂.

Here's the plan:

1. Expand the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ in terms of the uncoupled basis states |m₁, m₂⟩.
2. Identify the coefficient associated with m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1.
3. The square of this coefficient's absolute value will be the joint probability.

To proceed, I need to understand Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. These coefficients relate coupled states |l₁, l₂, l, m⟩ to uncoupled states |l₁, m₁⟩ |l₂, m₂⟩. The total m equals m₁ + m₂. Here, total m is -1, so we consider combinations where m₁ + m₂ = -1. The possible m values for each electron (since l=1 for p orbitals) are -1, 0, +1. The pairs (m₁, m₂) summing to -1 are:

- (-1, 0)
- (0, -1)

After revisiting, possible m₁ and m₂ combinations given m₁ + m₂ = -1 are:

If m₁ = -1, then m₂ = 0
If m₁ = 0, then m₂ = -1

And if m₁ = +1, m₂ would need to be -2, which isn't possible as m₂ is limited to -1, 0, +1. Hence, just two available combinations: (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

The coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1⟩ is a linear combination of uncoupled states |m₁=-1, m₂=0⟩ and |m₁=0, m₂=-1⟩. We must consider that the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2. The coupled state with l=2 and m=-1 falls within the l=2 multiplet. When two l=1 states are combined, possible total l values are 2, 1, 0. For l=2, m ranges from -2 to +2. So m=-1 is within the l=2 range.

The coefficients for expanding |l=2, m=-1⟩ with uncoupled states involve Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into total l=2, m=-1. The possible m₁ and m₂ we've found are (-1,0) and (0,-1), and their coefficients arise from the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients formula.

Alternatively, a symmetry might exist since the electrons are identical particles. However, the task does not mention antisymmetrizing the state, though electrons are fermions and their total wavefunction, including spin, should be antisymmetric. But we stick to ignoring the spin as stated.

Or maybe not. Wait, but if we ignore spin, then perhaps we\'re just looking at the spatial part, which for two electrons in an orbital would need to be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, or symmetric if the spin part is antisymmetric. But since spin is being ignored, the problem might not require considering the Pauli exclusion principle here. The problem states "ignoring their spin angular momentum", so perhaps we can treat them as distinguishable particles? Hmm, maybe.

The key point is that the coupled state |1,1,2,-1⟩ is a combination of the uncoupled states where m1 + m2 = -1, which are | -1, 0 ⟩ and |0, -1 ⟩. The coefficients for these can be found from the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is a bit involved, but maybe we can recall that for combining two angular momenta l1 and l2, the state |l, m⟩ is given by the sum over m1, m2 of ⟨l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m⟩ |l1, m1⟩ |l2, m2⟩.\n\nIn our case, l1 = l2 = 1, l = 2, m = -1.\n\nSo we need to compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients ⟨1, m1; 1, m2 | 2, -1⟩ for m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there\'s a symmetry or formula we can use. For the highest weight state (m = l), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 1 for the state where m1 = l1 and m2 = l2. Then, applying the lowering operator gives the other states. But here we have a lower state, m = -1. Maybe we can use the symmetry properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1 = 1, l2 = 1, l = 2, m = -1.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula:\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M⟩ is given by:\n\nsqrt( ( (2L + 1) / (2l1 + 1)(2l2 + 1) ) ) * something... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, use recursion relations.\n\nAlternatively, use the table of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nWait, here\'s a resource: for combining two l=1 states.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1 and l2=1 can be found in standard tables. Let me recall that when combining two spin-1 particles (or angular momentum 1), the total angular momentum states are l=2, 1, 0.\n\nFor l=2, the possible m values are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.\n\nThe state |2, -1⟩ can be expressed as a combination of |m1, m2⟩ with m1 + m2 = -1.\n\nFrom tables, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2, m=-1 would be:\n\n⟨1, m1; 1, m2 | 2, -1⟩.\n\nThe possible m1, m2 pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Let\'s see what the coefficients are.\n\nI think for the state |2, -1⟩, the combination is sqrt(1/2) | -1, 0 ⟩ + sqrt(1/2) |0, -1 ⟩. But let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The general formula is:\n\n⟨j1, m1; j2, m2 | J, M⟩ = delta_{M, m1 + m2} * sqrt( ( (2J + 1) / (j1 + j2 + J + 1) ) ) * ... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the formula involves factorials. The formula is:\n\n⟨j1, m1; j2, m2 | J, M⟩ = sqrt( (2J + 1) * (j1 + j2 - J)! (J + j1 - j2)! (J + j2 - j1)! ) / ( (j1 + j2 + J + 1)! ) ) * ... multiplied by some sum over k of (-1)^k / (k! (j1 - m1 - k)! (j2 + m2 - k)! (J - j2 + m1 + k)! (J - j1 - m2 + k)! ) )\n\nThis is the general formula, but it\'s complicated. Alternatively, use symmetry arguments.\n\nAlternatively, recall that when combining two l=1 states, the l=2 states are symmetric under exchange, the l=1 states are antisymmetric, and the l=0 state is symmetric. Wait, no, actually when combining two integer angular momenta, the symmetry of the states depends on the total angular momentum. For two l=1, the l=2 and l=0 states are symmetric, and the l=1 states are antisymmetric under exchange. Since the problem is about orbital angular momentum, which is bosonic (since spatial wavefunction), but electrons are fermions, so maybe the spatial part has to be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, but the problem says to ignore spin. So perhaps we can ignore the antisymmetrization here, so the states can be treated as distinguishable? Hmm, but the problem is about two electrons, which are identical particles. However, since we\'re ignoring spin, maybe the spatial part is allowed to be symmetric or antisymmetric, but the problem doesn\'t specify. But the given state is |1,1,2,-1⟩, which is a coupled state. Since the problem is presented in terms of distinguishable particles (they talk about particle 1 and particle 2), maybe we can proceed as if they are distinguishable. So the antisymmetrization is not required here. So perhaps the state is just a product state.\n\nBut regardless, the expansion of |2, -1⟩ in terms of |m1, m2⟩ is needed. Let me check some references.\n\nAlternatively, use ladder operators. The state |2, -1⟩ can be obtained by applying the lowering operator to |2, 0⟩, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, start from the highest state |2, 2⟩, which is |1, 1⟩ ⊗ |1, 1⟩. Then apply the lowering operator.\n\nLet me try that. The total angular momentum lowering operator L_- = L1_- + L2_-. Starting from |2, 2⟩ = |1, 1⟩ |1, 1⟩. Apply L_- to get |2, 1⟩:\n\nL_- |2, 2⟩ = (L1_- + L2_-) |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩ = sqrt(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + sqrt(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ = sqrt(2) |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + sqrt(2) |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩\n\nTherefore, |2,1⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) ( |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ )\n\nSimilarly, apply L_- again to get |2,0⟩:\n\nL_- |2,1⟩ = (L1_- + L2_-) (1/sqrt(2)) ( |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ )\n\nFirst term: L1_- |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ = sqrt(1(1+1) - 0(0-1)) |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩ = sqrt(2) |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩\n\nSecond term: L2_- |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ = sqrt(2) |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩\n\nThird term: L1_- |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ = sqrt(2) |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩\n\nFourth term: L2_- |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ = sqrt(2) |1,1⟩ |1,-1⟩\n\nSo altogether:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ sqrt(2) | -1,1⟩ + sqrt(2) |0,0⟩ + sqrt(2) |0,0⟩ + sqrt(2) |1,-1⟩ ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ sqrt(2) (| -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ) ]\n\nTherefore, the result is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) ( | -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ) / sqrt( (L_- applied twice) normalization )\n\nWait, no. Wait, when we apply L_- to |2,1⟩, we should get |2,0⟩ multiplied by sqrt( (2)(2+1) - 1(1-1) ) = sqrt(6 - 0) = sqrt(6). But let\'s check.\n\nWait, the norm of L_- |j, m⟩ is sqrt( j(j+1) - m(m-1) ). So for |2,1⟩, L_- |2,1⟩ has norm sqrt(2*3 -1*0) = sqrt(6). So the result of L_- |2,1⟩ should be sqrt(6) |2,0⟩. But according to our calculation above, we have:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) [ sqrt(2) | -1,1⟩ + sqrt(2)* |0,0⟩ + sqrt(2)* |0,0⟩ + sqrt(2) |1,-1⟩ ] =\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) [ | -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ] = [ | -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ]\n\nThe norm of this is sqrt(1² + 2² + 1²) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6), which matches. Therefore, |2,0⟩ = ( | -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ) / sqrt(6)\n\nSimilarly, apply L_- again to get |2,-1⟩. Let\'s do that.\n\nL_- |2,0⟩ = (L1_- + L2_-) ( | -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ) / sqrt(6)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: L1_- | -1,1⟩ = sqrt(1(1+1) - (-1)(-1 -1)) | -1 -1 ⟩ |1⟩ = sqrt(2 - (-1)(-2)) | -2,1 ⟩. Wait, but l=1, m1 can\'t be -2. Wait, no: L1_- acting on |1, -1⟩ (wait, no, the first term is | -1,1⟩, so m1=-1, m2=1. Then L1_- acts on m1=-1: but m1=-1 is already the lowest state for l=1, so L1_- | -1,1⟩ = 0.\n\nWait, no: L_- operator lowers m by 1. For a state |l, m⟩, L_- |l, m⟩ = sqrt( l(l+1) - m(m-1) ) |l, m-1⟩. So for m=-1, L_- |1, -1⟩ would be sqrt( 2 - (-1)(-2) ) |1, -2⟩, but m=-2 is invalid for l=1. Therefore, L1_- | -1,1⟩ = 0.\n\nSimilarly, L2_- acting on | -1,1⟩: m2=1, so L2_- | -1,1⟩ = sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩.\n\nSecond term: 2 |0,0⟩. Applying L1_-: L1_- |0,0⟩ = sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩. Similarly, L2_- |0,0⟩ = sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩. So total for the second term: 2 [ sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ + sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩ ] = 2sqrt(2) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )\n\nThird term: |1,-1⟩. Applying L1_-: m1=1, so L1_- |1,-1⟩ = sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩. Applying L2_-: m2=-1, which would give 0 as before. So L2_- |1,-1⟩ = 0.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nL_- |2,0⟩ = [ 0 + sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ ] + 2sqrt(2) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ ) + [ sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩ + 0 ] all divided by sqrt(6).\n\nWait, let\'s re-express:\n\nFirst term (from L1_- + L2_- on | -1,1⟩):\n\nL1_- | -1,1⟩ = 0\n\nL2_- | -1,1⟩ = sqrt(1(1+1) -1(1-1)) | -1,0⟩ = sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩\n\nSecond term (from L1_- + L2_- on 2 |0,0⟩):\n\n2 [ L1_- |0,0⟩ + L2_- |0,0⟩ ] = 2 [ sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ + sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩ ]\n\nThird term (from L1_- + L2_- on |1,-1⟩):\n\nL1_- |1,-1⟩ = sqrt(1(1+1) -1(1-1)) |0,-1⟩ = sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩\n\nL2_- |1,-1⟩ = 0\n\nSo total:\n\nsqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ + 2sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ + 2sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩ + sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor | -1,0⟩: sqrt(2) + 2sqrt(2) = 3sqrt(2)\n\nFor |0,-1⟩: 2sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 3sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, total is 3sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ + 3sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩ = 3sqrt(2) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )\n\nDivide by sqrt(6) (from the normalization of |2,0⟩):\n\nSo L_- |2,0⟩ = 3sqrt(2) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ ) / sqrt(6) = 3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )\n\nSimplify sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = 1/sqrt(3), so 3/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3). Therefore:\n\nL_- |2,0⟩ = sqrt(3) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )\n\nBut L_- |2,0⟩ should equal sqrt( (2)(3) - 0(-1) ) |2,-1⟩ = sqrt(6) |2,-1⟩. Therefore,\n\nsqrt(6) |2,-1⟩ = sqrt(3) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )\n\nTherefore,\n\n|2,-1⟩ = sqrt(3)/sqrt(6) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ ) = (1/sqrt(2)) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )\n\nTherefore, the expansion of |2,-1⟩ in terms of the uncoupled basis is (1/sqrt(2)) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ ).\n\nSo the coefficients for | -1,0⟩ and |0,-1⟩ are both 1/sqrt(2), and the other possible combinations (like | -1,-1⟩) have coefficient 0 because m1 + m2 must equal -1.\n\nBut the question is asking for the joint probability of getting both m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. However, in the expansion of |2,-1⟩, there is no term with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because m1 + m2 would be -2, which is not equal to -1. Therefore, the coefficient for | -1, -1 ⟩ is zero. Hence, the probability is zero.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me confirm.\n\nGiven the coupled state |1,1,2,-1⟩, when expressed in the uncoupled basis, only includes terms where m1 + m2 = -1. The possible m1 and m2 for each electron are -1, 0, +1. So the pairs that sum to -1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). The state | -1, -1 ⟩ sums to -2, which would correspond to total m = -2, which is part of the l=2 multiplet (since l=2 allows m from -2 to +2). However, our coupled state is |2,-1⟩, not |2,-2⟩. Therefore, in the expansion of |2,-1⟩, there is no component with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Hence, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ (i.e., m1 = -1 and m2 = -1) is zero.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability is 0.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more. The expansion we found for |2,-1⟩ is (1/sqrt(2)) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ ). So the possible outcomes when measuring L1z and L2z are either (-1,0) or (0,-1), each with probability |1/sqrt(2)|² = 1/2. There\'s no (-1,-1) term, so the probability is zero. Therefore, the answer should be 0.\n\nBut wait, the problem says "the eigenvalues of both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ". Since ħ is the unit here, and the eigenvalues of L_z for l=1 are mħ, where m = -1, 0, +1. So getting both eigenvalues as -ħ corresponds to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, which as we saw isn\'t present in the state |2,-1⟩. Hence, the probability is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0. So the joint probability is zero.\n\nBut wait, let me think if there\'s any other way this could be non-zero. Suppose there was a mistake in the expansion. Let me check again.\n\nStarting from |2,2⟩ = |1,1⟩|1,1⟩. Apply L_- to get |2,1⟩ = (|1,0⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,0⟩)/sqrt(2). Then apply L_- again to get |2,0⟩, which we found as (| -1,1⟩ + 2|0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩)/sqrt(6). Then apply L_- again to get |2,-1⟩, which we found as (| -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩)/sqrt(2). Then apply L_- once more to get |2,-2⟩ = | -1,-1⟩.\n\nSo yes, |2,-1⟩ does not include | -1,-1⟩. Therefore, the coefficient for | -1,-1⟩ is indeed zero in |2,-1⟩. Therefore, the probability is zero.\n\nBut let me think again: the problem states that the two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. So each has l=1. The coupled state is given as |1,1,2,-1⟩. When we measure L1z and L2z, we are asking for the probability that both are -ħ. Since the state doesn\'t have any component where both are -1, the probability is zero.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there\'s a different approach. The total state is symmetric under exchange? Because the coupled state with l=2 is symmetric. Since the two electrons are identical particles, but we\'re ignoring spin, does this affect the spatial wavefunction\'s symmetry?\n\nWait, electrons are fermions, so their total wavefunction (including spin) must be antisymmetric. If we ignore spin, then the spatial wavefunction would have to be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, or symmetric if the spin part is antisymmetric. However, the problem says to ignore spin, so perhaps we are to treat the spatial part as if it\'s the entire wavefunction, which for electrons would actually need to be antisymmetric. But since the problem says to ignore spin, maybe they\'re not considering the Pauli exclusion principle here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the spin part is symmetric (e.g., triplet state), so the spatial part must be antisymmetric. But the given coupled state |1,1,2,-1⟩ is symmetric under exchange of the two electrons because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2 are symmetric combinations. For example, |2,-1⟩ is (| -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩)/sqrt(2), which is symmetric under swapping the two particles (since swapping m1 and m2 would give (|0,-1⟩ + | -1,0⟩)/sqrt(2), which is the same as the original). Therefore, the spatial part is symmetric. If the spin part is also symmetric, then the total wavefunction would be symmetric, which is not allowed for electrons. But since the problem says to ignore spin, maybe we are to disregard this and just compute the probability as per the given state, even if it\'s unphysical for electrons. Therefore, the answer remains zero.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had considered antisymmetrization, the state might not exist, but the problem gives the state as |1,1,2,-1⟩, so we have to work with that.\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe joint probability is \\boxed{0}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745386975, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=5455, prompt_tokens=1167, total_tokens=6622, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \(-\hbar\) for the coupled angular momentum state \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\), we need to express this state in terms of the uncoupled basis states \(|m_1, m_2\rangle\).

1. **Coupled State Expansion**:
   The coupled state \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\) can be expanded using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For \( l = 2 \) and \( m = -1 \), the possible combinations of \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) (each ranging from -1, 0, +1) that sum to \( m = -1 \) are \((-1, 0)\) and \((0, -1)\).

2. **Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**:
   Using the lowering operator technique, we find that the state \(|2, -1\rangle\) is a combination of the uncoupled states \(|-1, 0\rangle\) and \(|0, -1\rangle\). The coefficients for these states are determined to be \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) each.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   The state \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\) is expressed as:
   \[
   |2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |-1, 0\rangle + |0, -1\rangle \right)
   \]
   This expansion shows that there are no terms where both \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are -1. Therefore, the coefficient for the state \(|-1, -1\rangle\) is zero.

4. **Conclusion**:
   Since the state \(|-1, -1\rangle\) is not present in the expansion of \(|2, -1\rangle\), the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \(-\hbar\) is zero.

\[
\boxed{0}

The formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is a bit involved, but maybe we can recall that for combining two angular momenta l1 and l2, the state |l, m⟩ is given by the sum over m1, m2 of ⟨l1, m1; l2, m2 | l, m⟩ |l1, m1⟩ |l2, m2⟩.

In our case, l1 = l2 = 1, l = 2, m = -1.

So we need to compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients ⟨1, m1; 1, m2 | 2, -1⟩ for m1 + m2 = -1.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry or formula we can use. For the highest weight state (m = l), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is 1 for the state where m1 = l1 and m2 = l2. Then, applying the lowering operator gives the other states. But here we have a lower state, m = -1. Maybe we can use the symmetry properties.

Alternatively, perhaps look up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1 = 1, l2 = 1, l = 2, m = -1.

Alternatively, use the formula:

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient ⟨l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M⟩ is given by:

sqrt( ( (2L + 1) / (2l1 + 1)(2l2 + 1) ) ) * something... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, use recursion relations.

Alternatively, use the table of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, here's a resource: for combining two l=1 states.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1 and l2=1 can be found in standard tables. Let me recall that when combining two spin-1 particles (or angular momentum 1), the total angular momentum states are l=2, 1, 0.

For l=2, the possible m values are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.

The state |2, -1⟩ can be expressed as a combination of |m1, m2⟩ with m1 + m2 = -1.

From tables, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2, m=-1 would be:

⟨1, m1; 1, m2 | 2, -1⟩.

The possible m1, m2 pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Let's see what the coefficients are.

I think for the state |2, -1⟩, the combination is sqrt(1/2) | -1, 0 ⟩ + sqrt(1/2) |0, -1 ⟩. But let me verify.

Alternatively, use the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The general formula is:

⟨j1, m1; j2, m2 | J, M⟩ = delta_{M, m1 + m2} * sqrt( ( (2J + 1) / (j1 + j2 + J + 1) ) ) * ... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the formula involves factorials. The formula is:

⟨j1, m1; j2, m2 | J, M⟩ = sqrt( (2J + 1) * (j1 + j2 - J)! (J + j1 - j2)! (J + j2 - j1)! ) / ( (j1 + j2 + J + 1)! ) ) * ... multiplied by some sum over k of (-1)^k / (k! (j1 - m1 - k)! (j2 + m2 - k)! (J - j2 + m1 + k)! (J - j1 - m2 + k)! ) )

This is the general formula, but it's complicated. Alternatively, use symmetry arguments.

Alternatively, recall that when combining two l=1 states, the l=2 states are symmetric under exchange, the l=1 states are antisymmetric, and the l=0 state is symmetric. Wait, no, actually when combining two integer angular momenta, the symmetry of the states depends on the total angular momentum. For two l=1, the l=2 and l=0 states are symmetric, and the l=1 states are antisymmetric under exchange. Since the problem is about orbital angular momentum, which is bosonic (since spatial wavefunction), but electrons are fermions, so maybe the spatial part has to be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, but the problem says to ignore spin. So perhaps we can ignore the antisymmetrization here, so the states can be treated as distinguishable? Hmm, but the problem is about two electrons, which are identical particles. However, since we're ignoring spin, maybe the spatial part is allowed to be symmetric or antisymmetric, but the problem doesn't specify. But the given state is |1,1,2,-1⟩, which is a coupled state. Since the problem is presented in terms of distinguishable particles (they talk about particle 1 and particle 2), maybe we can proceed as if they are distinguishable. So the antisymmetrization is not required here. So perhaps the state is just a product state.

But regardless, the expansion of |2, -1⟩ in terms of |m1, m2⟩ is needed. Let me check some references.

Alternatively, use ladder operators. The state |2, -1⟩ can be obtained by applying the lowering operator to |2, 0⟩, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, start from the highest state |2, 2⟩, which is |1, 1⟩ ⊗ |1, 1⟩. Then apply the lowering operator.

Let me try that. The total angular momentum lowering operator L_- = L1_- + L2_-. Starting from |2, 2⟩ = |1, 1⟩ |1, 1⟩. Apply L_- to get |2, 1⟩:

L_- |2, 2⟩ = (L1_- + L2_-) |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩ = sqrt(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + sqrt(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ = sqrt(2) |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + sqrt(2) |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩

Therefore, |2,1⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) ( |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ )

Similarly, apply L_- again to get |2,0⟩:

L_- |2,1⟩ = (L1_- + L2_-) (1/sqrt(2)) ( |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ )

First term: L1_- |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ = sqrt(1(1+1) - 0(0-1)) |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩ = sqrt(2) |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩

Second term: L2_- |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ = sqrt(2) |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩

Third term: L1_- |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ = sqrt(2) |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩

Fourth term: L2_- |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ = sqrt(2) |1,1⟩ |1,-1⟩

So altogether:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ sqrt(2) | -1,1⟩ + sqrt(2) |0,0⟩ + sqrt(2) |0,0⟩ + sqrt(2) |1,-1⟩ ]

Simplify:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ sqrt(2) (| -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ) ]

Therefore, the result is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) ( | -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ) / sqrt( (L_- applied twice) normalization )

Wait, no. Wait, when we apply L_- to |2,1⟩, we should get |2,0⟩ multiplied by sqrt( (2)(2+1) - 1(1-1) ) = sqrt(6 - 0) = sqrt(6). But let's check.

Wait, the norm of L_- |j, m⟩ is sqrt( j(j+1) - m(m-1) ). So for |2,1⟩, L_- |2,1⟩ has norm sqrt(2*3 -1*0) = sqrt(6). So the result of L_- |2,1⟩ should be sqrt(6) |2,0⟩. But according to our calculation above, we have:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ sqrt(2) | -1,1⟩ + sqrt(2)* |0,0⟩ + sqrt(2)* |0,0⟩ + sqrt(2) |1,-1⟩ ] =

(1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) [ | -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ] = [ | -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ]

The norm of this is sqrt(1² + 2² + 1²) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6), which matches. Therefore, |2,0⟩ = ( | -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ) / sqrt(6)

Similarly, apply L_- again to get |2,-1⟩. Let's do that.

L_- |2,0⟩ = (L1_- + L2_-) ( | -1,1⟩ + 2 |0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩ ) / sqrt(6)

Compute each term:

First term: L1_- | -1,1⟩ = sqrt(1(1+1) - (-1)(-1 -1)) | -1 -1 ⟩ |1⟩ = sqrt(2 - (-1)(-2)) | -2,1 ⟩. Wait, but l=1, m1 can't be -2. Wait, no: L1_- acting on |1, -1⟩ (wait, no, the first term is | -1,1⟩, so m1=-1, m2=1. Then L1_- acts on m1=-1: but m1=-1 is already the lowest state for l=1, so L1_- | -1,1⟩ = 0.

Wait, no: L_- operator lowers m by 1. For a state |l, m⟩, L_- |l, m⟩ = sqrt( l(l+1) - m(m-1) ) |l, m-1⟩. So for m=-1, L_- |1, -1⟩ would be sqrt( 2 - (-1)(-2) ) |1, -2⟩, but m=-2 is invalid for l=1. Therefore, L1_- | -1,1⟩ = 0.

Similarly, L2_- acting on | -1,1⟩: m2=1, so L2_- | -1,1⟩ = sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩.

Second term: 2 |0,0⟩. Applying L1_-: L1_- |0,0⟩ = sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩. Similarly, L2_- |0,0⟩ = sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩. So total for the second term: 2 [ sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ + sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩ ] = 2sqrt(2) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )

Third term: |1,-1⟩. Applying L1_-: m1=1, so L1_- |1,-1⟩ = sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩. Applying L2_-: m2=-1, which would give 0 as before. So L2_- |1,-1⟩ = 0.

Putting it all together:

L_- |2,0⟩ = [ 0 + sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ ] + 2sqrt(2) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ ) + [ sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩ + 0 ] all divided by sqrt(6).

Wait, let's re-express:

First term (from L1_- + L2_- on | -1,1⟩):

L1_- | -1,1⟩ = 0

L2_- | -1,1⟩ = sqrt(1(1+1) -1(1-1)) | -1,0⟩ = sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩

Second term (from L1_- + L2_- on 2 |0,0⟩):

2 [ L1_- |0,0⟩ + L2_- |0,0⟩ ] = 2 [ sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ + sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩ ]

Third term (from L1_- + L2_- on |1,-1⟩):

L1_- |1,-1⟩ = sqrt(1(1+1) -1(1-1)) |0,-1⟩ = sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩

L2_- |1,-1⟩ = 0

So total:

sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ + 2sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ + 2sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩ + sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩

Combine like terms:

For | -1,0⟩: sqrt(2) + 2sqrt(2) = 3sqrt(2)

For |0,-1⟩: 2sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 3sqrt(2)

Therefore, total is 3sqrt(2) | -1,0⟩ + 3sqrt(2) |0,-1⟩ = 3sqrt(2) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )

Divide by sqrt(6) (from the normalization of |2,0⟩):

So L_- |2,0⟩ = 3sqrt(2) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ ) / sqrt(6) = 3sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )

Simplify sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = 1/sqrt(3), so 3/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3). Therefore:

L_- |2,0⟩ = sqrt(3) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )

But L_- |2,0⟩ should equal sqrt( (2)(3) - 0(-1) ) |2,-1⟩ = sqrt(6) |2,-1⟩. Therefore,

sqrt(6) |2,-1⟩ = sqrt(3) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )

Therefore,

|2,-1⟩ = sqrt(3)/sqrt(6) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ ) = (1/sqrt(2)) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ )

Therefore, the expansion of |2,-1⟩ in terms of the uncoupled basis is (1/sqrt(2)) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ ).

So the coefficients for | -1,0⟩ and |0,-1⟩ are both 1/sqrt(2), and the other possible combinations (like | -1,-1⟩) have coefficient 0 because m1 + m2 must equal -1.

But the question is asking for the joint probability of getting both m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. However, in the expansion of |2,-1⟩, there is no term with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because m1 + m2 would be -2, which is not equal to -1. Therefore, the coefficient for | -1, -1 ⟩ is zero. Hence, the probability is zero.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me confirm.

Given the coupled state |1,1,2,-1⟩, when expressed in the uncoupled basis, only includes terms where m1 + m2 = -1. The possible m1 and m2 for each electron are -1, 0, +1. So the pairs that sum to -1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). The state | -1, -1 ⟩ sums to -2, which would correspond to total m = -2, which is part of the l=2 multiplet (since l=2 allows m from -2 to +2). However, our coupled state is |2,-1⟩, not |2,-2⟩. Therefore, in the expansion of |2,-1⟩, there is no component with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Hence, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ (i.e., m1 = -1 and m2 = -1) is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is 0.

But wait, let me check once more. The expansion we found for |2,-1⟩ is (1/sqrt(2)) ( | -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩ ). So the possible outcomes when measuring L1z and L2z are either (-1,0) or (0,-1), each with probability |1/sqrt(2)|² = 1/2. There's no (-1,-1) term, so the probability is zero. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But wait, the problem says "the eigenvalues of both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ". Since ħ is the unit here, and the eigenvalues of L_z for l=1 are mħ, where m = -1, 0, +1. So getting both eigenvalues as -ħ corresponds to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, which as we saw isn't present in the state |2,-1⟩. Hence, the probability is zero.

Therefore, the answer is 0. So the joint probability is zero.

But wait, let me think if there's any other way this could be non-zero. Suppose there was a mistake in the expansion. Let me check again.

Starting from |2,2⟩ = |1,1⟩|1,1⟩. Apply L_- to get |2,1⟩ = (|1,0⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,0⟩)/sqrt(2). Then apply L_- again to get |2,0⟩, which we found as (| -1,1⟩ + 2|0,0⟩ + |1,-1⟩)/sqrt(6). Then apply L_- again to get |2,-1⟩, which we found as (| -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩)/sqrt(2). Then apply L_- once more to get |2,-2⟩ = | -1,-1⟩.

So yes, |2,-1⟩ does not include | -1,-1⟩. Therefore, the coefficient for | -1,-1⟩ is indeed zero in |2,-1⟩. Therefore, the probability is zero.

But let me think again: the problem states that the two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. So each has l=1. The coupled state is given as |1,1,2,-1⟩. When we measure L1z and L2z, we are asking for the probability that both are -ħ. Since the state doesn't have any component where both are -1, the probability is zero.

But just to be thorough, maybe there's a different approach. The total state is symmetric under exchange? Because the coupled state with l=2 is symmetric. Since the two electrons are identical particles, but we're ignoring spin, does this affect the spatial wavefunction's symmetry?

Wait, electrons are fermions, so their total wavefunction (including spin) must be antisymmetric. If we ignore spin, then the spatial wavefunction would have to be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, or symmetric if the spin part is antisymmetric. However, the problem says to ignore spin, so perhaps we are to treat the spatial part as if it's the entire wavefunction, which for electrons would actually need to be antisymmetric. But since the problem says to ignore spin, maybe they're not considering the Pauli exclusion principle here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the spin part is symmetric (e.g., triplet state), so the spatial part must be antisymmetric. But the given coupled state |1,1,2,-1⟩ is symmetric under exchange of the two electrons because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2 are symmetric combinations. For example, |2,-1⟩ is (| -1,0⟩ + |0,-1⟩)/sqrt(2), which is symmetric under swapping the two particles (since swapping m1 and m2 would give (|0,-1⟩ + | -1,0⟩)/sqrt(2), which is the same as the original). Therefore, the spatial part is symmetric. If the spin part is also symmetric, then the total wavefunction would be symmetric, which is not allowed for electrons. But since the problem says to ignore spin, maybe we are to disregard this and just compute the probability as per the given state, even if it's unphysical for electrons. Therefore, the answer remains zero.

Alternatively, if the problem had considered antisymmetrization, the state might not exist, but the problem gives the state as |1,1,2,-1⟩, so we have to work with that.

Therefore, the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is zero.

**Final Answer**
The joint probability is \boxed{0}.

From |2,2⟩, L- gives |2,1⟩, then |2,0⟩, then |2,-1⟩, then |2,-2⟩. So to get |2,-1⟩, we need to apply L- three times. But this might get complicated.

To determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) for the coupled angular momentum state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \), we need to express this state in terms of the uncoupled basis states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \).

1. **Identify the possible \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) values**: For the total angular momentum quantum number \( m = -1 \), the possible combinations of \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) (each ranging from -1, 0, +1 for \( l = 1 \)) must satisfy \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). The valid pairs are \( (-1, 0) \) and \( (0, -1) \).

2. **Clebsch-Gordan coefficients**: The coupled state \( |1, 1, 2, -1\rangle \) can be expanded using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. For the state \( |2, -1\rangle \), the expansion in terms of uncoupled states is:
   \[
   |2, -1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle \right)
   \]

3. **Check for \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \)**: The combination \( (m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1) \) sums to \( -2 \), which is not possible for the total \( m = -1 \). Therefore, there is no component of \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) in the state \( |2, -1\rangle \).

4. **Probability calculation**: Since the coefficient for \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) in the expansion is zero, the probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) is zero.

Thus, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \) is \(\boxed{0}\).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be calculated using known formulas or tables. For two particles with l1=1 and l2=1, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for total l=2, m=-1 are:

⟨m1, m2 | 1, 1, 2, -1⟩ = ?

Looking up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1. The possible m1 and m2 values contributing to m=-1 are m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1. The coefficients for these terms would be sqrt(1/2) and sqrt(1/2), but I need to confirm this.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for combining two angular momenta l1 and l2, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l= l1 + l2 (maximal coupling) can be determined using the formula. Alternatively, using symmetry properties. Alternatively, maybe use ladder operators.

Alternatively, refer to standard Clebsch-Gordan tables. For example, when combining two spin-1 particles to get a spin-2 state. Let's consider the case where l=2, m=-1. The expansion would be:

|2, -1⟩ = C1 |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ + C2 |m1=0, m2=-1⟩

To find C1 and C2, use the fact that the state |2,2⟩ is |1,1⟩⊗|1,1⟩. Then applying the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2- to both sides. Let me try this approach.

Starting with |2, 2⟩ = |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩.

Apply L- to get |2,1⟩:

L- |2,2⟩ = (L1- + L2-) |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩

= L1- |1,1⟩ |1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩ L2- |1,1⟩

= ħ√(1(1+1) -1(1-1)) |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + ħ√(1(1+1) -1(1-1)) |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩

Wait, the lowering operator L- on |l, m⟩ gives √(l(l+1) - m(m-1)) |l, m-1⟩. So for l=1, m=1:

L- |1,1⟩ = √(1*2 -1*0) |1,0⟩ = √2 |1,0⟩

Therefore,

L- |2,2⟩ = √2 |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + √2 |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩

But L- |2,2⟩ = √(2(2+1) - 2(2-1)) |2,1⟩ = √(6 - 2) |2,1⟩ = √4 |2,1⟩ = 2 |2,1⟩

Therefore,

2 |2,1⟩ = √2 (|1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩)

Divide both sides by 2:

|2,1⟩ = (√2 / 2) (|1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩)

= (1/√2) (|1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩)

Similarly, apply L- again to get |2,0⟩:

L- |2,1⟩ = (L1- + L2-) |2,1⟩

But also, L- |2,1⟩ = √(2*3 -1*0) |2,0⟩ = √6 |2,0⟩

Alternatively, applying L- to the expression for |2,1⟩:

L- |2,1⟩ = (1/√2) [L1- |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + L1- |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ + L2- |1,0⟩ |1,1⟩ + L2- |1,1⟩ |1,0⟩ ]

Wait, no. Wait, L- acts on the tensor product as L1- + L2-, so:

L- |2,1⟩ = (1/√2) [ (L1- |1,0⟩) |1,1⟩ + |1,0⟩ (L2- |1,1⟩) + (L1- |1,1⟩) |1,0⟩ + |1,1⟩ (L2- |1,0⟩) ]

But L1- |1,0⟩ = √(1*2 -0*(-1)) |1,-1⟩ = √2 |1,-1⟩

L2- |1,1⟩ = √2 |1,0⟩

Similarly, L1- |1,1⟩ = √2 |1,0⟩

L2- |1,0⟩ = √2 |1,-1⟩

Therefore, substituting:

= (1/√2) [ √2 |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩ + |1,0⟩ √2 |1,0⟩ + √2 |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩ + |1,1⟩ √2 |1,-1⟩ ]

Simplify each term:

First term: √2 |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩

Second term: √2 |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩

Third term: √2 |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩

Fourth term: √2 |1,1⟩ |1,-1⟩

So combining:

= (1/√2) [ √2 (|1,-1,1,1⟩ + |1,1,1,-1⟩) + √2 (|1,0,1,0⟩ + |1,0,1,0⟩) ]

Factor out √2:

= (1/√2) * √2 [ |1,-1,1,1⟩ + |1,1,1,-1⟩ + |1,0,1,0⟩ + |1,0,1,0⟩ ]

= 1 * [ |1,-1,1,1⟩ + |1,1,1,-1⟩ + 2 |1,0,1,0⟩ ]

But we also know that L- |2,1⟩ = √6 |2,0⟩

Therefore,

√6 |2,0⟩ = |1,-1,1,1⟩ + |1,1,1,-1⟩ + 2 |1,0,1,0⟩

Thus,

|2,0⟩ = (1/√6) ( |1,-1,1,1⟩ + |1,1,1,-1⟩ + 2 |1,0,1,0⟩ )

Continuing this process would be tedious, but perhaps we can instead focus on the state we need, which is |2, -1⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry to exploit. Since we started with |2,2⟩ and applied the lowering operator twice to get to |2,0⟩, we need to apply it two more times to reach |2,-1⟩? Wait, no, each application of L- lowers m by 1. From |2,2⟩, L- gives |2,1⟩, then |2,0⟩, then |2,-1⟩, then |2,-2⟩. So to get |2,-1⟩, we need to apply L- three times. But this might get complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, use recursion relations or symmetry. Alternatively, refer to standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1 and l2=1. Let me recall that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2, m=-1 would be the same as for l=2, m=1 but with signs adjusted due to symmetry. Alternatively, use the property that the coefficients are symmetric or antisymmetric under certain operations.

Alternatively, check a table. From standard Clebsch-Gordan tables for 1 × 1 → 2:

The coefficients for |l=2, m⟩ are as follows (assuming real coefficients):

For m=2: |1,1⟩|1,1⟩

For m=1: sqrt(1/2) |1,0⟩|1,1⟩ + sqrt(1/2) |1,1⟩|1,0⟩

For m=0: sqrt(1/6) |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩ + sqrt(2/3) |1,0⟩|1,0⟩ + sqrt(1/6) |1,1⟩|1,-1⟩

For m=-1: sqrt(1/2) |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + sqrt(1/2) |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩

For m=-2: |1,-1⟩|1,-1⟩

Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check for m=1. When we derived |2,1⟩ earlier, we had:

|2,1⟩ = (1/√2)( |1,0⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,0⟩ )

Which matches the table. Similarly, m=-1 would be similar but with m=-1 and m=0. So:

|2,-1⟩ = (1/√2)( |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ )

Therefore, in the state |2,-1⟩, the possible m1 and m2 combinations are (-1,0) and (0,-1), each with coefficient 1/√2.

Therefore, the expansion of |1,1,2,-1⟩ in the uncoupled basis is:

|2,-1⟩ = (1/√2) [ |m1=-1, m2=0⟩ + |m1=0, m2=-1⟩ ]

But the problem asks for the joint probability of both m1 and m2 being -1. However, in the expansion above, neither term has both m1 and m2 equal to -1. The terms are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Therefore, the coefficient for the state |m1=-1, m2=-1⟩ is zero in the |2,-1⟩ state. Therefore, the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ (i.e., m1=-1 and m2=-1) is zero.

Wait, but this seems counterintuitive. Let me double-check. The total m is m1 + m2 = -1. If m1 and m2 are both -1, their sum would be -2, which can't contribute to the |2,-1⟩ state. Therefore, such a term cannot exist in the expansion. Hence, the probability is indeed zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero.

But let me confirm once again. The possible m1 and m2 for two l=1 particles when combined into a total l=2, m=-1 state must satisfy m1 + m2 = -1. The possible pairs (m1, m2) are (-1,0), (0,-1). The pair (-1,-1) sums to -2, which would belong to a different total m state (specifically, m=-2, which is part of the l=2 multiplet but requires l=2, m=-2). Therefore, the state |m1=-1, m2=-1⟩ is part of |2,-2⟩, not |2,-1⟩. Therefore, in the state |2,-1⟩, there is no component with both m1 and m2 being -1. Hence, the probability is zero.

Therefore, the answer should be 0. The joint probability is zero.

**Final Answer**
The joint probability is \boxed{0}.

To determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \(-\hbar\) for the coupled angular momentum state \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\), we need to express this state in terms of the uncoupled basis states \(|m_1, m_2\rangle\).

1. **Identify the possible \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) values**:
   - The total \(m\) value is \(-1\), so \(m_1 + m_2 = -1\).
   - The possible pairs \((m_1, m_2)\) that satisfy this are \((-1, 0)\) and \((0, -1)\).

2. **Expand the coupled state using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients**:
   - The coupled state \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\) is a linear combination of the uncoupled states \(|m_1, m_2\rangle\).
   - Using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for \(l_1 = 1\), \(l_2 = 1\), \(L = 2\), and \(M = -1\), we find that the state is an equal superposition of \(|-1, 0\rangle\) and \(|0, -1\rangle\).

3. **Determine the coefficients**:
   - The coefficients for the states \(|-1, 0\rangle\) and \(|0, -1\rangle\) are both \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).

4. **Calculate the probability**:
   - The probability of measuring both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) as \(-\hbar\) corresponds to the component \(|-1, -1\rangle\) in the expansion of \(|1, 1, 2, -1\rangle\).
   - Since this component does not exist in the expansion, the coefficient for \(|-1, -1\rangle\) is zero.

Thus, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues \(-\hbar\) for both \(L_{1z}\) and \(L_{2z}\) is \(\boxed{0}\).

So perhaps we can proceed without considering exchange symmetry.

Wait, but even in orbital angular momentum, if the particles are identical, their combined state should be symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange. But since spin is being ignored, maybe the problem is considering distinguishable particles? The problem statement says "two electrons," but if we ignore spin, perhaps we can treat them as distinguishable for the orbital part. Hmm, but even so, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients don't account for exchange symmetry. The problem might just be a simple angular momentum coupling problem without considering exchange. So proceed as if particles are distinguishable.

Therefore, the coupled state |l=2, m=-1⟩ is a combination of |m₁=-1, m₂=0⟩ and |m₁=0, m₂=-1⟩. The coefficients for these can be found from Clebsch-Gordan tables.

Looking up Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l₁=1, l₂=1, l=2, m=-1.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states to get l=2, m=-1. The formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is a bit involved, but perhaps we can recall or derive them.

Alternatively, use the fact that the state |l=2, m=2⟩ is |m₁=1, m₂=1⟩. Then, applying the lowering operator L- = L1- + L2- to generate the other states. Let's try that.

Start with |l=2, m=2⟩ = |1, 1⟩ ⊗ |1, 1⟩.

Apply L- = L1- + L2- to get |2, 1⟩:

L- |2, 2⟩ = (L1- + L2-) |1,1⟩|1,1⟩ = ħ√(2(2+1) - 2(2-1)) |2,1⟩ = ħ√(6 - 2)|2,1⟩ = ħ√4 |2,1⟩ = 2ħ |2,1⟩.

On the other hand, applying L1- + L2- to |1,1⟩|1,1⟩:

L1- |1,1⟩ = ħ√(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,0⟩ = ħ√2 |1,0⟩.

Similarly, L2- |1,1⟩ = ħ√2 |1,0⟩.

So (L1- + L2-)|1,1⟩|1,1⟩ = ħ√2 |1,0⟩|1,1⟩ + ħ√2 |1,1⟩|1,0⟩.

Therefore, equating to 2ħ |2,1⟩:

√2 (|1,0⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,0⟩) = 2 |2,1⟩.

Divide both sides by √2:

(|1,0⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,0⟩)/√2 = √2 |2,1⟩.

Therefore, |2,1⟩ = (|1,0⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,0⟩)/√2.

Similarly, we can apply L- again to get |2,0⟩:

L- |2,1⟩ = (L1- + L2-)|2,1⟩.

First, compute L- |2,1⟩ = ħ√(2(2+1) - 1(1-1)) |2,0⟩ = ħ√(6 - 0) |2,0⟩ = ħ√6 |2,0⟩.

On the other hand, applying L1- + L2- to |2,1⟩ = (|1,0⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,0⟩)/√2.

Compute L1- acting on each term:

L1- |1,0⟩|1,1⟩ = (L1- |1,0⟩) ⊗ |1,1⟩ = ħ√(1(1+1) - 0(0-1)) |1,-1⟩ ⊗ |1,1⟩ = ħ√2 |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩.

Similarly, L1- |1,1⟩|1,0⟩ = (L1- |1,1⟩) ⊗ |1,0⟩ = ħ√(1(1+1) - 1(1-1)) |1,0⟩ ⊗ |1,0⟩ = ħ√2 |1,0⟩|1,0⟩.

Similarly, L2- acting on |1,0⟩|1,1⟩ = |1,0⟩ ⊗ (L2- |1,1⟩) = |1,0⟩ ⊗ ħ√2 |1,0⟩ = ħ√2 |1,0⟩|1,0⟩.

L2- acting on |1,1⟩|1,0⟩ = |1,1⟩ ⊗ (L2- |1,0⟩) = |1,1⟩ ⊗ ħ√(1(1+1) - 0(0-1)) |1,-1⟩ = ħ√2 |1,1⟩|1,-1⟩.

So combining all terms:

(L1- + L2-)|2,1⟩ = (ħ√2 |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩ + ħ√2 |1,0⟩|1,0⟩ + ħ√2 |1,0⟩|1,0⟩ + ħ√2 |1,1⟩|1,-1⟩)/√2.

Simplify:

= ħ√2/√2 [ |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,-1⟩ + 2 |1,0⟩|1,0⟩ ]

= ħ [ |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,-1⟩ + 2 |1,0⟩|1,0⟩ ]

But this should equal ħ√6 |2,0⟩. Therefore:

|2,0⟩ = [ |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,-1⟩ + 2 |1,0⟩|1,0⟩ ] / √6.

Similarly, we can apply L- again to get |2,-1⟩:

Compute L- |2,0⟩ = ħ√(2(2+1) - 0(0-1)) |2,-1⟩ = ħ√6 |2,-1⟩.

On the other hand, apply L1- + L2- to |2,0⟩.

First, let's write |2,0⟩ as [ |a⟩|b⟩ + |b⟩|a⟩ + 2 |c⟩|c⟩ ] / √6, where a=-1, b=1, c=0.

Applying L1- + L2-:

First, L1- on each term:

L1- |a⟩|b⟩ = L1- |1,-1⟩ |1,1⟩ = (L1- |1,-1⟩) |1,1⟩ = 0 because m₁ cannot go below -1.

L1- |b⟩|a⟩ = L1- |1,1⟩ |1,-1⟩ = (L1- |1,1⟩) |1,-1⟩ = ħ√2 |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩.

L1- |c⟩|c⟩ = L1- |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩ = (L1- |1,0⟩) |1,0⟩ = ħ√2 |1,-1⟩ |1,0⟩.

Similarly, L2- on each term:

L2- |a⟩|b⟩ = |1,-1⟩ (L2- |1,1⟩) = |1,-1⟩ ħ√2 |1,0⟩.

L2- |b⟩|a⟩ = |1,1⟩ (L2- |1,-1⟩) = |1,1⟩ * 0 = 0.

L2- |c⟩|c⟩ = |1,0⟩ (L2- |1,0⟩) = |1,0⟩ ħ√2 |1,-1⟩.

Therefore, combining all terms:

(L1- + L2-)|2,0⟩ = (1/√6)[

0 + ħ√2 |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩ + ħ√2 |1,-1⟩ |1,0⟩

+ ħ√2 |1,-1⟩ |1,0⟩ + 0 + ħ√2 |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩

+ 2*(ħ√2 |1,-1⟩ |1,0⟩ + ħ√2 |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩ )

Wait, no, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Let me try again.

Wait, actually, the expansion of |2,0⟩ is [ |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩ + |1,1⟩|1,-1⟩ + 2 |1,0⟩|1,0⟩ ] / √6.

So applying L1- + L2- to each term:

First term: |1,-1⟩|1,1⟩. Applying L1- gives 0 (since m₁=-1 can't go lower). Applying L2- gives |1,-1⟩ L2- |1,1⟩ = |1,-1⟩ * ħ√2 |1,0⟩.

Second term: |1,1⟩|1,-1⟩. Applying L1- gives L1- |1,1⟩ |1,-1⟩ = ħ√2 |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩. Applying L2- gives |1,1⟩ L2- |1,-1⟩ = 0.

Third term: 2 |1,0⟩|1,0⟩. Applying L1- gives 2 L1- |1,0⟩ |1,0⟩ = 2 ħ√2 |1,-1⟩ |1,0⟩. Applying L2- gives 2 |1,0⟩ L2- |1,0⟩ = 2 ħ√2 |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩.

Therefore, total L- acting on |2,0⟩:

= (1/√6)[ (0 + |1,-1⟩ ħ√2 |1,0⟩) + (ħ√2 |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩ + 0) + (2 ħ√2 |1,-1⟩ |1,0⟩ + 2 ħ√2 |1,0⟩ |1,-1⟩) ]

Simplify:

= (ħ√2 / √6)[ |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ + 2 |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + 2 |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ ]

Combine like terms:

The first two terms: 1 |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + 1 |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩

The next two terms: 2 |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + 2 |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩

Total: (1 + 2) |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + (1 + 2) |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ = 3 |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + 3 |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩

But wait, that can't be. Let me check:

Wait, the expansion is:

First term: |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ (from L2- on first term)

Second term: |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ (from L1- on second term)

Third term: 2 |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ (from L1- on third term)

Fourth term: 2 |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ (from L2- on third term)

So total:

1 |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + 1 |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ + 2 |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + 2 |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩

= 3 |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + 3 |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩

Therefore, (ħ√2 / √6) * 3 (|1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ )

Factor out 3:

= 3 ħ√2 / √6 (|1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ )

Simplify 3 / √6 = √6 / √2:

Since 3 / √6 = 3 / (√2 * √3) ) = √3 / √2. Wait, 3 / √6 = √(9/6) = √(3/2) = √(3)/√(2).

But let's compute 3 * √2 / √6:

3 * √2 / √6 = 3 / √3 = √3.

Wait:

√6 = √(2*3) = √2 * √3

So 3 * √2 / √6 = 3 * √2 / (√2 * √3) ) = 3 / √3 = √3.

Therefore, the expression becomes:

√3 * ħ (|1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ )

But according to the L- operator, this should equal ħ√6 |2,-1⟩.

So:

√3 * ħ (|1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ ) = ħ√6 |2,-1⟩

Divide both sides by ħ:

√3 (|1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ ) = √6 |2,-1⟩

Divide both sides by √3:

(|1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ ) = √(6/3) |2,-1⟩ = √2 |2,-1⟩

Therefore,

|2,-1⟩ = ( |1,-1⟩|1,0⟩ + |1,0⟩|1,-1⟩ ) / √2

Therefore, the coupled state |2,-1⟩ is an equal combination of |m₁=-1, m₂=0⟩ and |m₁=0, m₂=-1⟩.

But wait, in the expansion above, the coefficients are 1/√2 each. So the state |2,-1⟩ is an equal superposition of these two uncoupled states.

But the original question is about the probability of both m₁ and m₂ being -1. However, in the expansion of |2,-1⟩, the possible m₁ and m₂ values are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). There is no term with both m₁ and m₂ being -1. Therefore, the coefficient for |m₁=-1, m₂=-1⟩ in the expansion of |2,-1⟩ is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me confirm.

The possible m₁ and m₂ combinations that sum to m=-1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1). There is no combination where both m₁ and m₂ are -1 because that would sum to -2, which is only possible if the total l=2, m=-2. But our state is |2,-1⟩, which requires m=-1, so the sum m₁ + m₂ = -1. Therefore, the only possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Therefore, there is no component in |2,-1⟩ where both m₁ and m₂ are -1. Hence, the probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ is zero.

But let me check if perhaps there's a different way. Suppose the state is |2,-1⟩, which is part of the symmetric combination (since l=2 is symmetric under exchange). The |m₁=-1, m₂=-1⟩ state would have m=-2, which is part of the l=2, m=-2 state. But in our case, the state is m=-1. Therefore, there's no overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the expansion only includes those two terms. Wait, but when we applied the lowering operator, we only got those two terms. So the conclusion is that in the |2,-1⟩ state, the possible m₁ and m₂ are (-1,0) and (0,-1), each with coefficient 1/√2, so their probabilities are (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 each. Therefore, the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Hence, the joint probability is zero.

But to make sure, perhaps check a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient table.

Looking up Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

According to standard tables, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 states into L=2, M=-1 are:

⟨m1, m2 | 2, -1⟩ = sqrt(1/2) if (m1, m2) = (-1, 0) or (0, -1)

And zero otherwise.

Therefore, the state |2,-1⟩ is indeed composed of an equal superposition of | -1, 0 ⟩ and | 0, -1 ⟩ with coefficients 1/√2 each. Therefore, when measuring L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes are (-1,0) and (0,-1), each with probability 1/2. The outcome (-1,-1) is not present in the state, hence the probability is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability of both L₁z and L₂z being -ħ is 0.

**Final Answer**
The joint probability is \boxed{0}.
