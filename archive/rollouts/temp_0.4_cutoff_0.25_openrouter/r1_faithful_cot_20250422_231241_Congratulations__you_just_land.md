To express and purify the Human p53 protein in *E. coli* BL21, the optimal plasmid should include the following features:

1. **T7 Promoter**: Compatible with BL21(DE3) strains, which supply T7 RNA polymerase for IPTG-induced expression.  
2. **Codon-Optimized Sequence**: The p53 gene must be codon-optimized for *E. coli* to ensure efficient translation, as human codons are often poorly expressed in bacterial systems.  
3. **Affinity Tag with Cleavage Site**: A His-tag (e.g., 6xHis) at the N-terminus facilitates purification via nickel affinity chromatography. A protease cleavage site (e.g., TEV or thrombin) allows removal of the tag post-purification, yielding the native p53 sequence provided.  
4. **Regulatory Elements**: A lac operator to control T7 promoter activity with IPTG induction and a strong ribosome binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) for efficient translation initiation.  
5. **Standard Cloning Elements**: An origin of replication for *E. coli* (e.g., pBR322 ori) and an antibiotic resistance marker (e.g., ampicillin resistance) for plasmid maintenance and selection.

**Conclusion**: The correct plasmid is the one containing the **T7 promoter, codon-optimized p53 sequence, N-terminal His-tag with a protease cleavage site**, and compatible regulatory/selection elements. This design ensures high-yield expression and straightforward purification of the native p53 protein.

Okay, so I just started my dream job at a top structural biology lab at Stanford, and the first task is to produce and purify the Human p53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmids with different sequences. I need to figure out which plasmid to use. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that E. coli is commonly used for protein expression, but there are some considerations. The p53 protein is human, so it's a eukaryotic protein. E. coli might have trouble expressing it properly because of differences in post-translational modifications, codon usage, or protein folding. But the question is about choosing the right plasmid among four options. Since the plasmids have different sequences, maybe they differ in promoters, tags, or other elements that affect expression and purification.

First, let me recall that for protein expression in E. coli, the plasmid should have a strong promoter like T7, which is induced by IPTG. The BL21 strain is commonly used with T7 promoters because it carries the T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the lacUV5 promoter. So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter to be compatible with BL21(DE3), which has the T7 RNA polymerase. Wait, but the question says E. coli BL21. Wait, some BL21 strains are DE3 positive, meaning they have the T7 polymerase, and others are DE3 negative. So maybe the plasmid needs to have a T7 promoter, but then the host must be BL21(DE3). But the question states BL21, maybe implying DE3? Not sure. But perhaps the plasmid will have a T7 promoter regardless.

Also, the plasmid should have an origin of replication compatible with E. coli, but that's probably standard. The other thing is the presence of a selection marker, like ampicillin resistance. But all plasmids likely have that. The key differences might be in the promoter, the presence of a fusion tag for purification, and maybe a ribosome binding site optimized for E. coli.

Looking at the amino acid sequence of p53, it's a relatively long protein (I can count the amino acids if needed, but maybe not necessary). The plasmid should have the coding sequence for p53, but codon-optimized for E. coli. Since human genes might have codons that are rare in E. coli, leading to low expression. So the plasmid should have the p53 gene codon-optimized for E. coli. Alternatively, the plasmid might have the native human sequence, which might not express well. So if the four plasmids have different versions, the correct one is the codon-optimized version.

Additionally, for purification, affinity tags are commonly used. Tags like His-tag (6xHis), GST, or MBP are fused to the protein to allow purification via nickel columns, glutathione resin, or amylose resin, respectively. The amino acid sequence provided for p53 doesn't start with a His-tag or other tag, but maybe the plasmid includes a tag that's cleavable. For example, the plasmid might have an N-terminal His-tag followed by a thrombin or TEV protease site, allowing cleavage of the tag after purification. So the expressed protein would have the tag, which is then removed, leaving the native p53 sequence.

So, the correct plasmid should have:

1. T7 promoter (for expression in BL21(DE3))
2. Codon-optimized p53 gene for E. coli
3. An affinity tag (like His-tag) that's cleavable
4. Possibly a strong ribosome binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) optimized for E. coli

If the four plasmids differ in these aspects, the correct one would be the one with T7 promoter, codon-optimized, and with a His-tag. For example, if one plasmid has the native human p53 sequence without any tag, it might not express well and would be hard to purify. Another might have a GST tag but no promoter compatible with BL21. Another might have the T7 promoter but no codon optimization, leading to low expression. The best would be the one with T7, codon-optimized, His-tag (maybe with a cleavage site), and appropriate RBS.

Wait, but the question gives the amino acid sequence of p53, which doesn't include any tags. So the plasmid must include the coding sequence for p53, possibly with a tag that's removed post-purification. Therefore, the expressed protein would have a tag, but after cleavage, it would match the given sequence. So the plasmid's DNA sequence would include the tag, but the amino acid sequence provided is the mature protein. Therefore, the correct plasmid should have a cleavable tag.

Alternatively, maybe the plasmid doesn't have a tag, and purification would be via other methods, but that's less common. His-tags are standard for quick purification. So the plasmid likely includes a His-tag followed by a protease cleavage site, then the p53 sequence.

So putting this all together, the correct plasmid would have:

- T7 promoter for induction with IPTG in BL21(DE3)
- Codon-optimized p53 gene for E. coli expression
- N-terminal His-tag with a cleavage site (like TEV protease site)
- Appropriate selectable marker (amp resistance)
- Origin of replication for E. coli

Therefore, among the four plasmids, the one that includes all these features would be the right choice. The question is presented as multiple-choice, but since the options aren't listed, I have to infer based on standard practices. But since the user hasn't provided the actual plasmid sequences, perhaps this is a hypothetical question where the answer is based on standard plasmid features for recombinant protein expression in E. coli.

Another thing to consider is the presence of a secretion signal. However, E. coli doesn't efficiently secrete eukaryotic proteins, so the protein would likely be expressed in the cytoplasm. If the plasmid includes a secretion signal (like pelB or ompA), it might direct the protein to the periplasm, but p53 is a nuclear protein, and secretion might not be necessary. So probably cytoplasmic expression with a His-tag.

Also, the plasmid might have a lac operator to control expression with IPTG. The T7 promoter is usually regulated by the lac operator, so in the absence of IPTG, expression is off. When IPTG is added, the T7 RNA polymerase is induced (in BL21(DE3)), leading to high expression.

In summary, the correct plasmid should have the T7 promoter, codon-optimized p53 with an N-terminal His-tag and cleavage site, and other necessary elements. Among the four options given (even though not listed here), the one that matches these criteria is the right choice.

I recently began my dream position at a leading structural biology laboratory at Stanford, and my initial assignment involves producing and purifying Human p53 protein using E. coli BL21. The Principal Investigator provided me with the amino acid sequence and four different plasmids containing various sequences. My task is to determine which plasmid would be most appropriate for this work. I need to approach this methodically.

I recall that E. coli is a popular choice for protein expression, though there are important factors to consider. Since p53 is a human (eukaryotic) protein, E. coli might face challenges expressing it correctly due to differences in post-translational modifications, codon usage, or protein folding mechanisms. However, my current focus is on selecting the most suitable plasmid from the four options. The differences in their sequences might involve variations in promoters, tags, or other components that influence expression and purification efficiency.

For protein expression in E. coli, I know the plasmid should contain a strong promoter such as T7, which responds to IPTG induction. The BL21 strain typically works well with T7 promoters because it carries the T7 RNA polymerase controlled by the lacUV5 promoter. Therefore, the plasmid should include a T7 promoter to be compatible with BL21(DE3), which contains the T7 RNA polymerase. I'm noticing that the question specifically mentions E. coli BL21. It's worth noting that some BL21 strains are DE3 positive (containing T7 polymerase) while others are DE3 negative. So the plasmid may need a T7 promoter, but then the host would need to be BL21(DE3). The question only states BL21, possibly implying DE3, though I'm not certain. Nevertheless, the plasmid likely includes a T7 promoter regardless.

I recently started working at my dream job, which is at a leading structural biology lab at Stanford. My initial assignment is to produce and purify the Human p53 protein in E. coli BL21. The principal investigator provided me with the amino acid sequence and four plasmids with different sequences, and I need to determine which plasmid to use. I’m going to analyze this step by step.

Firstly, I'm aware that E. coli is commonly used for protein expression, but there are challenges since the p53 protein is of human origin, thus a eukaryotic protein. E. coli might struggle with proper expression due to differences in post-translational modifications, codon preference, or protein folding. The task involves selecting the appropriate plasmid out of four options. The plasmids have varied sequences, suggesting potential differences in promoters, tags, or other elements that could influence expression and purification.

I need to remember that for successful protein expression in E. coli, the plasmid should include a strong promoter such as T7, which is activated by IPTG. It's important because BL21 strain is often used with T7 promoters owing to its T7 RNA polymerase being controlled by the lacUV5 promoter. Therefore, the plasmid should contain a T7 promoter to function with BL21(DE3), as this strain features the T7 RNA polymerase. But since the task mentions E. coli BL21, this may be a reference to BL21(DE3), which has the T7 polymerase. It could be plausible that the plasmid needs to have a T7 promoter, assuming the host is indeed BL21(DE3). However, the task specifies BL21, possibly alluding to DE3? Uncertainty remains. Nevertheless, the plasmid might have a T7 promoter regardless.

Therefore, the answer is the plasmid that contains the T7 promoter, a His-tag sequence, and the codon-optimized p53 gene for expression in E. coli. The PI would want a plasmid that allows for high expression (T7 promoter), efficient translation (codon-optimized), and easy purification (His-tag). Therefore, the correct plasmid is likely a pET vector (like pET-28a) with the p53 gene cloned into it with an N-terminal His-tag and thrombin or TEV protease cleavage site. However, since the question doesn't provide options, I can only outline the reasoning. But since this is a multiple-choice scenario (4 plasmids), the answer would be the one with T7 promoter, His-tag, and codon optimization.

To select the optimal plasmid for expressing and purifying Human p53 in *E. coli* BL21, the plasmid must include key features ensuring efficient expression and straightforward purification. Here's the breakdown:

### **Critical Features of the Correct Plasmid:**
1. **T7 Promoter System**:  
   - BL21 strains (often DE3 variants) contain T7 RNA polymerase under the *lacUV5* promoter. The plasmid must include a **T7 promoter** to drive p53 expression, induced by IPTG. This ensures high-level, tightly regulated transcription.

2. **Affinity Tag for Purification**:

3. **Ribosome Binding Site (RBS)**:  
   - An optimized **Shine-Dalgarno sequence** upstream of the start codon ensures efficient translation in *E. coli*.

4. **Regulatory Elements**:  
   - A **lac operator** sequence to suppress basal expression (prevent leaky transcription) before IPTG induction.

5. **Compatibility with BL21**:  
   - **Ampicillin or kanamycin resistance** for selection, and a **high-copy origin** (e.g., pUC) for plasmid maintenance.

### **Why Other Plasmids Fail**:  
- **No T7 Promoter**: Incompatible with BL21(DE3)'s T7 polymerase, leading to no expression.  
- **No His-tag**: Complicates purification, requiring additional steps (e.g., antibodies or custom methods).  
- **Weak/Unoptimized RBS**: Poor translation efficiency, reducing yield.  
- **Non-inducible System**: Leaky expression or inability to control protein production.

### **Final Answer**:  
**Choose the plasmid with:**  
- **T7 promoter** (for IPTG-inducible expression in BL21),  
- **6xHis tag** (for Ni/NTA affinity purification),  
- **Strong RBS**, and  
- **Amp/Kan resistance**.  

This combination ensures high-yield expression and rapid, cost-effective purification of Human p53.

Another consideration is the presence of a fusion tag. For purification purposes, affinity tags like His-tags (6xHis) are commonly used. The plasmid might include a His-tag sequence to allow purification using nickel or cobalt affinity chromatography. The tag is usually placed at the N- or C-terminus of the protein. The amino acid sequence provided for p53 doesn't have a His-tag, so the plasmid must include this in the coding sequence. Therefore, the correct plasmid should have a His-tag added to the p53 gene.

Additionally, the plasmid should have an origin of replication compatible with E. coli, such as a high-copy origin like pUC. However, since all plasmids are designed for E. coli, this might not be the differentiating factor. Antibiotic resistance is another feature; common ones are ampicillin or kanamycin.

The presence of a ribosome binding site (RBS) optimized for E. coli is essential for efficient translation. The plasmid should have a Shine-Dalgarno sequence upstream of the start codon. If the plasmid sequences vary in their RBS efficiency, the one with a strong RBS would be preferable.

Moreover, the presence of a lac operator or other regulatory elements for inducible expression. The T7 promoter is typically under the control of the lac operator, allowing induction with IPTG. If the plasmid uses a T7/lac promoter, that's ideal for tight regulation to prevent leaky expression before induction.

Since the question gives four plasmids with different sequences, the right choice would be the one that includes a T7 promoter, a His-tag, and the necessary regulatory elements. If one of the plasmids has a T7 promoter and a His-tag (either N-terminal or C-terminal), that would be the one to choose. Additionally, the plasmid should include a multiple cloning site where the p53 gene is inserted in frame with the His-tag.

Possible pitfalls: a plasmid without a His-tag would complicate purification. A plasmid with a weak promoter or incompatible promoter (like a eukaryotic promoter) wouldn't express in E. coli. Also, if the plasmid uses a different induction system (e.g., arabinose-inducible) but the strain isn't compatible, that would be an issue. However, BL21(DE3) is typically used with T7 promoters.

Therefore, without seeing the actual sequences, based on standard plasmid features for E. coli expression, the correct plasmid should be the one containing a T7 promoter, a His-tag, and the necessary elements for induction and selection. The answer likely points to the plasmid that includes these features, which would enable high-level expression and easy purification of the p53 protein.
