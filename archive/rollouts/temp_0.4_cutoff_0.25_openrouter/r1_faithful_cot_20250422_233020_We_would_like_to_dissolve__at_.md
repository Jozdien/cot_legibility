To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**
   - Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol
   - Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol

2. **Determine the moles of H⁺ required:**
   - Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ for neutralization.
   - Moles of H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol

3. **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed:**
   - Volume = moles / concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³

4. **Determine the pH of the resulting solution:**
   - Concentration of Fe³+ in solution = 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M
   - Using the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ and the ion product of water (Kw):
     - Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]³ = 6.3×10⁻³⁸
     - Kw = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0×10⁻¹⁴
     - Equilibrium constant K = Kw³ / Ksp = (1.0×10⁻¹⁴)³ / 6.3×10⁻³⁸ ≈ 1.587×10⁻⁵
     - [H⁺]³ = K * [Fe³+] = 1.587×10⁻⁵ * 0.009358 ≈ 1.484×10⁻⁷
     - [H⁺] ≈ (1.484×10⁻⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3×10⁻³ M
     - pH ≈ -log(5.3×10⁻³) ≈ 2.28

### Final Answer
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.28}.

Okay, so I need to figure out how much 0.1 M monobasic strong acid is required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution at 25°C. Then, I also have to find the pH of the resulting solution. Let me start by recalling some chemistry concepts here.

First, Fe(OH)₃ is a metal hydroxide, and since we're using a strong acid, I think the reaction will involve the acid neutralizing the hydroxide and dissolving the iron(III) hydroxide. Since the acid is monobasic, it's probably something like HCl, HNO₃, or similar. The reaction should produce Fe³+ ions, water, and the corresponding chloride or nitrate, depending on the acid. But since the acid is monobasic, the formula would be something like:

Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³+ + 3H₂O

Wait, because each hydroxide (OH⁻) needs one H⁺ to neutralize it. Fe(OH)₃ has three OH⁻ groups, so three H⁺ ions are needed per Fe(OH)₃ molecule. That makes sense. So first, I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 grams.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃: Fe is 55.85 g/mol, O is 16.00 g/mol, H is 1.01 g/mol. So:

55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.01) = 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.

So, 0.1 grams divided by 106.88 g/mol is approximately 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)₃.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺, the moles of H⁺ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 moles per liter. So, volume needed is moles divided by concentration. So 0.002808 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. So approximately 28.1 cm³ of acid is needed. But wait, the problem says "minimum volume". Is there another factor here?

Wait, maybe after dissolving Fe(OH)₃, the solution might still be acidic or basic, but since we are using a strong acid, once we add enough acid to neutralize the hydroxide, any excess acid will determine the pH. However, the question is about the minimum volume needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃. So, maybe we just need to have stoichiometric amount of H⁺ to react with Fe(OH)₃. So 28.1 cm³ would be the answer for the volume. But let me check again.

Wait, but when you dissolve Fe(OH)₃, the Fe³+ will be in solution. However, Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water to produce H⁺ ions. So even after dissolving, the solution might still be acidic because of the Fe³+ hydrolysis. But the question is about the minimum volume needed. So maybe the stoichiometric calculation is sufficient for the volume, but the pH will be determined by the Fe³+ hydrolysis.

But let me verify. Let's first calculate the volume of acid needed.

Yes, 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ is 0.1 / 106.88 ≈ 0.0009358 moles. Each mole needs 3 moles H⁺, so 0.002807 moles H⁺. Since the acid is 0.1 M, volume is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. So approximately 28.1 cm³. But the question says "minimum volume". Is there a possibility that some excess acid is needed to lower the pH enough to keep Fe³+ in solution? Because sometimes, even if you add stoichiometric amounts, the solution might be such that the metal ion hydrolyzes and reforms the hydroxide unless the pH is sufficiently low.

Hmm. So maybe we need to consider the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ to ensure that after adding the acid, the solution is such that Fe³+ remains dissolved. Let me recall that.

The dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ can be represented as:

Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻

The solubility product Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3

At 25°C, the Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 6.3×10⁻³⁸. That's a very small number, meaning Fe(OH)₃ is not very soluble. So, when we add acid, we are neutralizing the OH⁻ ions, shifting the equilibrium to the right, dissolving more Fe(OH)₃. But once all the Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, we need to make sure that the concentration of Fe³+ and OH⁻ in solution does not exceed the Ksp, otherwise precipitation would occur. Wait, but if we have added enough acid to convert all Fe(OH)₃ into Fe³+, then the remaining solution would have Fe³+ ions and the corresponding anion from the acid (like Cl⁻ or NO₃⁻). However, Fe³+ can hydrolyze:

Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺

This hydrolysis reaction produces H⁺ ions, which lower the pH. So even after dissolving Fe(OH)₃ with the stoichiometric amount of acid, the solution might still be acidic due to Fe³+ hydrolysis. Therefore, the pH of the solution will be determined by this hydrolysis.

But the problem is about the minimum volume of acid needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃. If we add exactly the stoichiometric amount, then the Fe³+ would be in solution, but due to the hydrolysis, the pH might be low enough to prevent precipitation. Wait, but if we add exactly the stoichiometric H⁺, then the amount of H⁺ added is exactly the amount needed to neutralize the OH⁻ from Fe(OH)₃. However, once Fe³+ is in solution, it will hydrolyze, releasing more H⁺. So in reality, the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But does this hydrolysis affect the solubility? If the pH is too high, Fe(OH)₃ would precipitate again. But since we are adding a strong acid, once we have dissolved the Fe(OH)₃, the solution's pH is controlled by the excess H⁺ from the acid and the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Wait, but if we add just enough acid to neutralize the OH⁻ from Fe(OH)₃, then the solution would contain Fe³+ and the anion from the acid (say Cl⁻). The hydrolysis of Fe³+ would produce H⁺, making the solution acidic. Therefore, the pH would be low enough that Fe(OH)₃ doesn't precipitate again. So maybe the stoichiometric amount is sufficient. Therefore, the minimum volume is 28.1 cm³.

But let me check if that's the case. Let's suppose we add 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M H⁺. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³. So the acid is diluted into 100 cm³. Wait, wait, the problem says "dissolve in 100 cm³ total volume". So the total volume after adding acid and the Fe(OH)₃ is 100 cm³. Therefore, the volume of acid added plus the volume of water (and the small volume from Fe(OH)₃) should be 100 cm³. Wait, but Fe(OH)₃ is a solid, so its volume is negligible. So if we add V cm³ of acid, then the total volume is V + (100 - V) = 100 cm³. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ total volume". So the total volume of the solution after adding the acid and dissolving the Fe(OH)₃ is 100 cm³. Therefore, the volume of acid added plus the volume of water added equals 100 cm³. But since the acid is a solution, when we add V cm³ of acid, we are adding V cm³ of the acid solution, and then the rest (100 - V) cm³ is water. Wait, but maybe the problem is not considering the water added, and just says that the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps the acid is added to a volume that when diluted to 100 cm³, it dissolves the Fe(OH)₃. But I need to clarify.

Alternatively, maybe we need to add V cm³ of 0.1 M acid to 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ and then dilute to 100 cm³. But the way the problem is phrased: "What is the minimum volume (cm³) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution..." So probably, the acid is added to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃, and the total volume of the solution is made up to 100 cm³. But in that case, the volume of acid is part of the 100 cm³. Therefore, when calculating the concentration of H⁺ needed, we have to consider the final volume.

Wait, this is a crucial point. If the total volume is 100 cm³, then when we add V cm³ of 0.1 M acid, the moles of H⁺ added are 0.1 * V / 1000 (since M is mol/L). Then, the total volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L. Therefore, the concentration of H⁺ from the acid is (0.1 * V / 1000) / 0.1 = V / 1000 / 0.1 = V / 100. Wait, no: 0.1 M is moles per liter. So moles of H⁺ = 0.1 * (V / 1000). Then, in 0.1 L (100 cm³), the concentration is (0.1 * V / 1000) / 0.1 = V / 1000 / 0.1 = V / 100. Wait, that seems incorrect.

Wait, let's do it step by step. If you take V cm³ of 0.1 M acid, the number of moles of H⁺ is:

0.1 mol/L * (V / 1000 L) = 0.0001 * V mol.

Then, when you dilute this to 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the concentration of H⁺ is (0.0001 * V) / 0.1 = 0.001 * V M.

But wait, 0.0001 * V is in moles, divided by 0.1 L gives 0.001 * V moles per liter.

But we need these H⁺ moles to react with Fe(OH)₃. The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺, so total H⁺ needed is 0.0009358 * 3 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

But the H⁺ available is 0.0001 * V (from the acid). Wait, but when you dilute to 100 cm³, is the H⁺ from the acid consumed in the reaction, or is it the concentration after dilution?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's think again. The acid is added to the Fe(OH)₃, and the total volume is 100 cm³. So the reaction between Fe(OH)₃ and H⁺ occurs in 100 cm³ of solution.

So the moles of H⁺ needed to react with Fe(OH)₃ is 3 * moles of Fe(OH)₃, which is 3 * (0.1 / 106.88) ≈ 0.002807 mol.

These moles of H⁺ must come from the acid. The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. But since the total volume is 100 cm³, this 28.07 cm³ is part of the 100 cm³. Therefore, you would take 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M acid, add it to the Fe(OH)₃, and then add water to make up to 100 cm³. Wait, but if you take 28.07 cm³ of acid and dilute to 100 cm³, the concentration of H⁺ from the acid would be (0.1 M * 28.07 cm³) / 100 cm³ = 0.02807 M. But we need 0.002807 moles of H⁺, which is 0.002807 mol in 0.1 L (100 cm³) is 0.02807 M. So that's correct.

But wait, when you add 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M acid to a total volume of 100 cm³, the concentration of H⁺ from the acid is 0.02807 M. But all of that H⁺ is consumed in the reaction with Fe(OH)₃. Then, after the reaction, the solution contains Fe³+ and the anion from the acid (say Cl⁻ if HCl is used). But Fe³+ will hydrolyze to produce H⁺. Therefore, the pH of the solution is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Therefore, the minimum volume of acid required is indeed 28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³. Then, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

So now, to find the pH of the resulting solution. Let's calculate the concentration of Fe³+ in the solution. The moles of Fe³+ is equal to the moles of Fe(OH)₃, which is 0.0009358 mol. The total volume is 0.1 L, so [Fe³+] = 0.0009358 / 0.1 = 0.009358 M.

Fe³+ undergoes hydrolysis:

Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is related to the Ksp of Fe(OH)₃ and the Kw of water. Let's recall that:

Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10⁻³⁸

Kw = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0×10⁻¹⁴

The hydrolysis reaction can be considered as:

Fe³+ + 3H₂O → Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺

But since Fe(OH)₃ is a solid, but in reality, once dissolved, the Fe³+ will hydrolyze in water until the solution is saturated. However, since we have already dissolved the Fe(OH)₃, the solution should be just at the point where Fe(OH)₃ is about to precipitate. Wait, but we added the stoichiometric amount of acid. So maybe the solution is saturated with Fe(OH)₃, and the pH is such that [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = Ksp.

But if Fe³+ is in solution, then the hydrolysis would produce H⁺. Let's model this.

Assuming that Fe³+ hydrolyzes as follows:

Fe³+ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H⁺

But the hydrolysis can occur in multiple steps, but for simplicity, let's consider the first hydrolysis step:

Fe³+ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H⁺

The equilibrium constant for this step is K₁ = [Fe(OH)²+][H⁺]/[Fe³+]

The value of K₁ for Fe³+ is approximately 6.5×10⁻³.

Alternatively, if considering the overall hydrolysis to Fe(OH)₃, the reaction is:

Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+] = K_w³ / Ksp

Because:

From Ksp: [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = Ksp

From Kw: [H⁺][OH⁻] = Kw ⇒ [OH⁻] = Kw / [H⁺]

Substituting into Ksp:

[Fe³+]*(Kw / [H⁺])³ = Ksp ⇒ [Fe³+] = Ksp [H⁺]³ / Kw³

Rearranged:

[H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+] = Kw³ / Ksp

Therefore, the equilibrium constant K = Kw³ / Ksp = (1.0×10⁻¹⁴)³ / (6.3×10⁻³⁸) = (1×10⁻⁴²)/(6.3×10⁻³⁸) ≈ 1.587×10⁻⁵

So K = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+] ≈ 1.587×10⁻⁵

Given that [Fe³+] is 0.009358 M, we can set up:

[H⁺]^3 = K * [Fe³+] = 1.587×10⁻⁵ * 0.009358 ≈ 1.484×10⁻⁷

Then [H⁺] = (1.484×10⁻⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3×10⁻³ M

Therefore, pH ≈ -log(5.3×10⁻³) ≈ 2.28

But wait, this seems a bit low. Let me check the calculations.

First, K = Kw³ / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5

Then [H⁺]^3 = 1.587e-5 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.587e-5 * 9.358e-3 = 1.587*9.358e-8 ≈ 14.84e-8 = 1.484e-7

Cube root of 1.484e-7: Let's compute.

(1.484e-7)^(1/3) = (1.484)^(1/3) * (1e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 1.14 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.3e-3

So [H⁺] ≈ 5.3e-3 M, pH ≈ 2.28

But let me verify if this approach is correct. By considering the hydrolysis reaction producing H⁺, we can find the pH. However, in reality, the solution will have Fe³+ ions which hydrolyze in steps, and each step releases H⁺. The first hydrolysis step is the most significant, so maybe using the first hydrolysis constant is more accurate.

But I used the overall hydrolysis to Fe(OH)₃, which might be a better approach because the problem states that we dissolved Fe(OH)₃. So the solution should be at the brink of precipitation, hence using Ksp is appropriate.

Alternatively, since we have dissolved the Fe(OH)₃ by adding acid, and the solution is now containing Fe³+ ions, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

But the calculation above gives pH ≈ 2.28. Let me check with another approach.

The concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009358 M. Let's assume that Fe³+ hydrolyzes as:

Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺

The equilibrium expression is K = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+] = Kw³ / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5

So [H⁺]^3 = 1.587e-5 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.484e-7

[H⁺] ≈ (1.484e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3e-3 M

pH = -log(5.3e-3) ≈ 2.28

Alternatively, if I use the first hydrolysis constant K₁ ≈ 6.5e-3:

Fe³+ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H⁺

K₁ = [Fe(OH)²+][H⁺]/[Fe³+] = 6.5e-3

Let [H⁺] = x, then [Fe(OH)²+] = x, and [Fe³+] = 0.009358 - x ≈ 0.009358 (since x is small)

So K₁ ≈ x² / 0.009358 = 6.5e-3

x² = 6.5e-3 * 0.009358 ≈ 6.5e-3 * 9.358e-3 ≈ 6.0827e-5

x ≈ sqrt(6.0827e-5) ≈ 7.8e-3

Then [H⁺] ≈ 7.8e-3 M, pH ≈ 2.11

But this is considering only the first hydrolysis step. However, Fe³+ can hydrolyze further:

Fe(OH)²+ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₂+ + H⁺

But the subsequent hydrolysis steps have smaller constants, so their contribution to [H⁺] is less significant. However, even the first step gives a pH around 2.1, which is close to the previous calculation. The difference arises from the method used. Since the problem mentions dissolving Fe(OH)₃, using the Ksp approach is more appropriate because it considers the equilibrium between Fe³+ and Fe(OH)₃. However, in reality, the hydrolysis of Fe³+ occurs in steps, and the pH is slightly lower than calculated via the Ksp method.

But given that both methods give a pH around 2.1 to 2.3, and the exact value might depend on which hydrolysis constants are used, but since the problem might expect using the Ksp relation, I'll go with the pH ≈ 2.28.

Therefore, the minimum volume of acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.

But let me check once again for any mistakes.

First, the molar mass of Fe(OH)₃:

Fe: 55.85, O: 16.00*3=48.00, H: 1.01*3=3.03. Total: 55.85 + 48.00 + 3.03 = 106.88 g/mol. Correct.

0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Correct.

Moles of H⁺ needed: 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol. Correct.

Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³. Correct.

Total volume is 100 cm³, so [Fe³+] = 0.0009358 / 0.1 = 0.009358 M. Correct.

Using K = Kw³ / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5. Correct.

[H⁺]^3 = 1.587e-5 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.484e-7. Cube root ≈ 5.3e-3. pH ≈ 2.28. Correct.

Alternatively, since after adding the acid, the solution contains Fe³+ and the anion (Cl⁻, etc.), but the anion from a strong acid doesn't hydrolyze, so the pH is solely due to Fe³+ hydrolysis. Therefore, the pH calculation is correct.

So the answers should be:

Minimum volume: approximately 28.1 cm³

pH: approximately 2.28

But let me check standard references. The pH of Fe³+ solutions is typically around 2-3, so this makes sense.

**Final Answer**
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.28}.

Okay, so I need to figure out how much 0.1 M monobasic strong acid is required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution at 25°C. Then, I also have to find the pH of the resulting solution. Let me start by recalling some chemistry concepts here.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃: Fe is 55.85 g/mol, O is 16.00 g/mol, H is 1.01 g/mol. So:

55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.01) = 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.

So, 0.1 grams divided by 106.88 g/mol is approximately 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)₃.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺, the moles of H⁺ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 moles per liter. So, volume needed is moles divided by concentration. So 0.002808 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. So approximately 28.1 cm³ of acid is needed. But wait, the problem says "minimum volume". Is there another factor here?

Wait, maybe after dissolving Fe(OH)₃, the solution might still be acidic or basic, but since we are using a strong acid, once we add enough acid to neutralize the hydroxide, any excess acid will determine the pH.

Hmm. So maybe we need to consider the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ to ensure that after adding the acid, the solution is such that Fe³+ remains dissolved. Let me recall that.

The dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ can be represented as:

Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻

The solubility product Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3

At 25°C, the Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 6.3×10⁻³⁸. That's a very small number, meaning Fe(OH)₃ is not very soluble. So, when we add acid, we are neutralizing the OH⁻ ions, shifting the equilibrium to the right, dissolving more Fe(OH)₃.

# Anthropic completion

I need to determine the amount of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution at 25°C, and then find the pH of the resulting solution. Let me apply some key chemistry principles to this problem.

Fe(OH)₃ is a metal hydroxide that will react with a strong acid (likely HCl or HNO₃). Since the acid is monobasic, the reaction should follow this equation:

Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O

This makes sense because each hydroxide group (OH⁻) requires one H⁺ ion for neutralization, and Fe(OH)₃ contains three OH⁻ groups.

First, I'll calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃ in 0.1 grams by determining its molar mass:
Fe: 55.85 g/mol
O: 16.00 g/mol (×3)
H: 1.01 g/mol (×3)
Total: 55.85 + 3(16.00 + 1.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol

Therefore, 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)₃ equals approximately 0.000936 moles (0.1 ÷ 106.88).

Since each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺, we need 3 × 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles of H⁺.

With the acid concentration at 0.1 M (0.1 moles per liter), the required volume is:
0.002808 moles ÷ 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters = 28.08 cm³

So approximately 28.1 cm³ of the acid is needed. However, I should verify if this is truly the "minimum volume" needed.

It's important to consider that Fe³⁺ is a Lewis acid that can hydrolyze in water to produce H⁺ ions, potentially making the solution acidic even after the initial dissolution. Also, we must ensure that the solubility product (Ksp) conditions are met to keep Fe³⁺ in solution.

The dissolution equilibrium of Fe(OH)₃ is:
Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³⁺ + 3OH⁻

The Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ at 25°C is approximately 6.3×10⁻³⁸, indicating very low solubility. By adding acid, we neutralize OH⁻ ions, shifting the equilibrium to dissolve more Fe(OH)₃.

Alright, so I need to calculate how much 0.1 M monobasic strong acid is required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution at 25°C. Following that, I need to determine the pH of the resulting solution. I'll begin by reviewing some chemistry concepts.

Fe(OH)₃ is a metal hydroxide, and with a strong acid, the reaction involves neutralizing the hydroxide to dissolve iron(III) hydroxide. Since the acid is monobasic, it's likely HCl, HNO₃, or a similar acid. The reaction should yield Fe³+ ions, water, and the corresponding anion from the acid. For a monobasic acid, the equation would be:

Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³+ + 3H₂O

Each hydroxide (OH⁻) requires one H⁺ for neutralization. Fe(OH)₃ contains three OH⁻ groups, which means three H⁺ ions are necessary per molecule of Fe(OH)₃. This aligns with the equation. First, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)₃ are in 0.1 grams.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as follows: Fe is 55.85 g/mol, O is 16.00 g/mol, and H is 1.01 g/mol. Therefore:

55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.01) = 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol.

Therefore, 0.1 grams divided by 106.88 g/mol gives approximately 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)₃.

Given each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺, the amount of H⁺ needed is 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles.

Since the acid is 0.1 M or 0.1 moles per liter, the volume needed is moles divided by concentration, giving us 0.002808 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which equals 28.08 cm³. Therefore, approximately 28.1 cm³ of the acid is required. However, the problem specifies "minimum volume," implying another consideration.

When dissolving Fe(OH)₃, the solution might still be acidic or basic, yet using a strong acid means that any excess acid will dictate the pH. Since the question pertains to the minimum volume needed to dissolve Fe(OH)₃, the stoichiometric quantity should suffice. Thus, 28.1 cm³ would be the correct volume. To ensure, let me check this once more.

Upon dissolving Fe(OH)₃, Fe³+ remains in the solution, and it's a Lewis acid, potentially hydrolyzing in water to produce H⁺ ions. Despite dissolving, the solution could still be acidic due to Fe³+ hydrolysis. As the question concerns the minimum volume needed, the stoichiometric calculation for volume should be adequate, although the pH is influenced by Fe³+ hydrolysis.

To confirm: for 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃, 0.1 / 106.88 ≈ 0.0009358 moles are present. Each mole requires 3 moles of H⁺, amounting to 0.002807 moles of H⁺ needed. Since the acid is 0.1 M, the volume becomes 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³, or approximately 28.1 cm³. Given the "minimum volume" stipulation, could it be that extra acid is necessary to sufficiently reduce the pH for keeping Fe³+ dissolved? Occasionally, even when adding stoichiometric amounts, the solution's nature might cause metal ion hydrolysis, reforming the hydroxide unless the pH is low enough.

So it might be necessary to consider the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ to confirm that once the acid is added, the solution facilitates Fe³+ staying dissolved. Let's recall that.

The dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ can be expressed as:

Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻

The solubility product, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]⁻³

At 25°C, the Ksp for Fe(OH)₃ is approximately 6.3×10⁻³⁸—an exceedingly small value, indicating low solubility for Fe(OH)₃. So, adding the acid neutralizes the OH⁻ ions, driving the equilibrium rightward, further dissolving Fe(OH)₃. However, once all Fe(OH)₃ dissolves, it's vital to avoid exceeding the Ksp with Fe³+ and OH⁻ concentrations, to prevent precipitation. But if sufficient acid is present to convert all Fe(OH)₃ to Fe³+, the remaining solution will contain Fe³+ ions and corresponding anions like Cl⁻ or NO₃⁻ from the acid. However, Fe³+ can hydrolyze in water, potentially releasing H⁺ ions.

However, Fe³⁺ hydrolysis will still produce H⁺. So, the pH calculation must account for this hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, if we add more acid than required, we might have excess H⁺, but the problem asks for the minimum volume, which should be the stoichiometric amount needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃. However, perhaps even more acid is needed to suppress the OH⁻ concentration sufficiently to dissolve all Fe(OH)₃. Let me re-examine this.\n\nThe initial approach assumes stoichiometric reaction, but in reality, the solubility equilibrium must be considered. Let me approach this using the solubility product.\n\nThe problem states that we need to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ (0.1 L). Let's first find the concentration of Fe³⁺ in solution once dissolved.\n\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol\nConcentration of Fe³⁺ in 0.1 L = 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M\n\nThe solubility product Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10⁻³⁸\n\nIf [Fe³+] is 0.009358 M, then [OH⁻]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+] = (6.3×10⁻³⁸) / 0.009358 ≈ 6.73×10⁻³⁶\n\nThus, [OH⁻] ≈ (6.73×10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) ≈ 1.88×10⁻¹² M\n\nThen, pH = 14 - (-log[H⁺]) = 14 - (log(1.88×10⁻¹²) / log(10)) → but [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = 1×10⁻¹⁴ / 1.88×10⁻¹² ≈ 5.32×10⁻³ M\n\npH = -log(5.32×10⁻³) ≈ 2.27\n\nWait, but this pH is after dissolution. However, how much acid is needed to achieve this [H⁺]?\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is more accurate. To dissolve Fe(OH)₃, the acid must provide H⁺ to neutralize the OH⁻ ions from Fe(OH)₃ dissolution. But since Fe(OH)₃ is very insoluble, even after adding acid, the Fe³+ will hydrolyze to produce H⁺. Therefore, the total H⁺ required is both to neutralize the OH⁻ from Fe(OH)₃ and to maintain the solution pH such that Fe(OH)₃ remains dissolved.\n\nBut maybe the stoichiometric approach is insufficient, and we need to use the Ksp to find the required [H⁺], then compute the acid needed to achieve that pH.\n\nLet me try this method.\n\nWe need to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ into 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009358 M. Using Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10⁻³⁸\n\nSo [OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10⁻³⁸ / 0.009358 ≈ 6.73×10⁻³⁶\n\n[OH⁻] = (6.73×10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) ≈ 1.88×10⁻¹² M\n\nThen, [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = 1e-14 / 1.88e-12 ≈ 5.32e-3 M → pH ≈ 2.27\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting solution would be approximately 2.27.\n\nNow, to find the amount of acid needed to achieve this pH. The acid (HA) is a strong monobasic acid, so it will dissociate completely: HA → H⁺ + A⁻\n\nThe total H⁺ in solution comes from two sources: the acid added and the hydrolysis of Fe³+. However, when we add the acid, it will first neutralize the OH⁻ from Fe(OH)₃ dissolution and then contribute to the H⁺ concentration. But this seems a bit circular.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ requires H⁺ to neutralize OH⁻. Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ releases 3 moles of OH⁻, which must be neutralized by 3 moles of H⁺. Additionally, the Fe³+ will hydrolyze to produce H⁺. But perhaps the hydrolysis is accounted for in the Ksp expression.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the system.\n\nWhen we add H⁺ (from the acid) to dissolve Fe(OH)₃:\n\nFe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³+ + 3H₂O\n\nThis is the dissolution reaction. The amount of H⁺ required is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃. Then, once dissolved, Fe³+ will hydrolyze:\n\nFe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺\n\nThis hydrolysis produces H⁺, but if we have already added H⁺ to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃, the total H⁺ in solution will be the H⁺ from the acid minus the H⁺ consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)₃ plus the H⁺ produced by hydrolysis. Wait, but this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the dissolution reaction (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³+ + 3H₂O) consumes 3 H⁺ per Fe(OH)₃. Then, the hydrolysis of Fe³+ (Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺) produces 3 H⁺. So, if all Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved by adding exactly 3 moles of H⁺ per mole of Fe(OH)₃, the hydrolysis would produce 3 H⁺, which would exactly offset the H⁺ consumed. Therefore, the net H⁺ would be zero? But that can't be right because the solution would then have Fe³+ and some H⁺ from water autoionization. Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is significant, and even though stoichiometrically the H⁺ consumed and produced cancel out, the actual H⁺ concentration is determined by the hydrolysis equilibrium.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stoichiometric approach is sufficient for the minimum volume of acid, and the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nMoles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol\n\nMoles of H⁺ needed for dissolution: 3 × 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol\n\nVolume of 0.1 M acid needed: 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³\n\nSo, the minimum volume of acid required is 28.1 cm³. Then, after dissolution, the Fe³+ concentration is 0.009358 M (0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nFe³+ hydrolysis:\n\nFe³+ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H⁺\n\nThis is a stepwise hydrolysis, but for simplicity, we can consider the overall hydrolysis:\n\nFe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺\n\nBut the equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+] = Kw^3 / Ksp\n\nWait, let's derive the expression. The dissolution reaction for Fe(OH)₃ is:\n\nFe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10⁻³⁸\n\nHydrolysis of Fe³+ can be written as:\n\nFe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+] = (Kw^3) / Ksp\n\nBecause, from the dissolution reaction, [OH⁻]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+], so [H⁺]^3 = Kw^3 / [OH⁻]^3 = Kw^3 / (Ksp / [Fe³+]) ) = (Kw^3 [Fe³+]) / Ksp\n\nTherefore, K = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+] = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 ≈ (1e-42) / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5\n\nThus, K ≈ 1.587e-5 = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+]\n\nGiven [Fe³+] = 0.009358 M, then:\n\n[H⁺]^3 = K × [Fe³+] = 1.587e-5 × 0.009358 ≈ 1.485e-7\n\n[H⁺] ≈ (1.485e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3e-3 M → pH ≈ -log(5.3e-3) ≈ 2.28\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is approximately 2.28.\n\nBut wait, this calculation assumes that the only source of H⁺ is the hydrolysis of Fe³+. However, the acid added is a strong acid, which would contribute H⁺. But in the stoichiometric calculation, we added exactly the H⁺ needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ (i.e., 0.002807 mol H⁺). Then, when Fe³+ hydrolyzes, it produces H⁺. But if we added exactly the H⁺ needed to dissolve Fe(OH)₃, then the H⁺ from hydrolysis would be additional. However, in reality, the dissolution reaction consumes H⁺ (3 H⁺ per Fe(OH)₃), and the hydrolysis produces H⁺ (3 H⁺ per Fe³+). So, net H⁺ would be the H⁺ from hydrolysis minus the H⁺ consumed in dissolution. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Let me clarify.\n\nThe dissolution process requires adding H⁺ to neutralize the OH⁻ from Fe(OH)₃. Once dissolved, Fe³+ hydrolyzes to produce H⁺. So, the H⁺ added via acid is consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)₃, and the H⁺ from hydrolysis is a new source. However, since the dissolution and hydrolysis are reciprocal reactions, perhaps the net effect is that the H⁺ from hydrolysis is what's present in solution, and the H⁺ from the acid is entirely consumed.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that dissolving Fe(OH)₃ with H⁺ converts the solid into Fe³+ and water. The Fe³+ then hydrolyzes to produce H⁺. The amount of H⁺ produced by hydrolysis would be equal to the amount consumed in dissolution only if the solution is at equilibrium. But since the acid is strong and we’re adding it to dissolve Fe(OH)₃, the H⁺ from the acid is used up in the dissolution, and the resulting solution's H⁺ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nWait, but that can't be exactly true. Let's model the system step by step.\n\n1. Add n moles of H⁺ (from acid) to dissolve Fe(OH)₃.\n\nThe reaction is Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³+ + 3H₂O. The stoichiometry requires 3 moles of H⁺ per mole of Fe(OH)₃. So, if we have m moles of Fe(OH)₃, we need 3m moles of H⁺.\n\nAfter dissolution, we have m moles of Fe³+ in solution, and 3m moles of H⁺ have been consumed.\n\nBut since we added n moles of H⁺, the remaining H⁺ is n - 3m. However, Fe³+ will hydrolyze to produce H⁺:\n\nFe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺\n\nLet’s denote the extent of hydrolysis as x. Then, the amount of H⁺ produced is 3x. However, since Fe(OH)₃ is a solid, its activity is 1, so the equilibrium expression is:\n\nK = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+]\n\nFrom earlier, K ≈ 1.587e-5\n\nThe initial concentration after dissolution (before hydrolysis) is [Fe³+] = m / V, and [H⁺] = (n - 3m) / V. But wait, if we added exactly n = 3m, then the initial [H⁺] would be zero. However, hydrolysis will produce H⁺. But if n > 3m, there would be excess H⁺. If n = 3m, then [H⁺] is determined solely by hydrolysis. If n < 3m, then not all Fe(OH)₃ would dissolve.\n\nThe problem states that we need to dissolve all 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃, so n must be at least 3m. However, the minimum volume corresponds to n = 3m, i.e., stoichiometric amount. Therefore, after dissolution, [H⁺] is determined by hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nTherefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+ as calculated earlier (~2.28). The volume of acid required is 28.1 cm³.\n\nBut wait, let's cross-verify. If we add exactly the stoichiometric amount of H⁺ (28.1 cm³ of 0.1 M acid), then after dissolution, the solution contains Fe³+ and the anion from the acid (e.g., Cl⁻ if HCl is used). The Fe³+ hydrolyzes to produce H⁺, which contributes to the pH. The initial H⁺ from the acid is all consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)₃, so the only H⁺ present is from hydrolysis. Thus, the pH calculation based on hydrolysis is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if excess acid is added, there would be leftover H⁺, leading to a lower pH. But since we're asked for the minimum volume (i.e., no excess acid), the pH is solely due to Fe³+ hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, the answers should be:\n\nMinimum volume of acid: 28.1 cm³\n\npH of the solution: approximately 2.28\n\nBut let's check if the Ksp approach aligns with this. If we dissolve 0.009358 M Fe³+, the required [OH⁻] is 1.88e-12, leading to [H+] = 5.32e-3, pH 2.27. This matches the hydrolysis calculation. Therefore, both methods confirm the pH is around 2.27-2.28.\n\nThus, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.\n\nHowever, let's check the exact value for Ksp. Different sources might report slightly different Ksp values for Fe(OH)₃. For example, some sources cite Ksp as low as 2.79×10⁻³⁹. If a different Ksp is used, the pH would change slightly. But assuming the given Ksp is 6.3×10⁻³⁸ (as per my initial calculation), the pH would be around 2.27.\n\nAlso, considering significant figures, the given data (0.1 g, 100 cm³, 0.1 M) suggest maybe two significant figures. So, the volume would be 28 cm³ and pH 2.3. But let's check the exact calculation.\n\nMolar mass of Fe(OH)₃: Fe = 55.85, O = 16.00×3 = 48.00, H = 1.008×3 = 3.024. Total = 55.85 + 48.00 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol. So, 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol.\n\nH⁺ needed: 3 × 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol.\n\nVolume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³ → 28.1 cm³ when rounded to three significant figures.\n\nFor pH, using [H+] = 5.32e-3 → pH = -log(5.32e-3) ≈ 2.274, which rounds to 2.27.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects using a more precise Ksp value or a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in K expression.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: After dissolving Fe(OH)₃ with the stoichiometric amount of acid, the solution contains Fe³+ and the conjugate base of the strong acid (e.g., Cl⁻). Since the acid is strong, the conjugate base does not affect pH. The pH is then determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe³+ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H⁺\n\nThe equilibrium expression for the first hydrolysis step is:\n\nK₁ = [Fe(OH)²+][H⁺] / [Fe³+]\n\nThe value of K₁ for Fe³+ hydrolysis is approximately 6.5×10⁻³. However, considering multiple hydrolysis steps complicates the calculation. But if we use the simplified overall hydrolysis producing 3 H⁺ ions per Fe³+, then using K = Kw^3 / Ksp as before gives a more accurate result.\n\nAlternatively, if using K₁ = 6.5×10⁻³, the pH calculation would differ. Let me see.\n\nAssuming only the first hydrolysis step:\n\nFe³+ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H⁺; K₁ = 6.5×10⁻³\n\nLet the concentration of Fe³+ be 0.009358 M. Let x be the concentration of H⁺ produced.\n\nAt equilibrium:\n\n[Fe(OH)²+] = x\n\n[H⁺] = x\n\n[Fe³+] = 0.009358 - x\n\nThus,\n\nK₁ = (x)(x) / (0.009358 - x) ≈ x² / 0.009358 = 6.5e-3\n\nSolving for x² = 6.5e-3 × 0.009358 ≈ 6.083e-5 → x ≈ √(6.083e-5) ≈ 7.8e-3 M\n\nThus, [H⁺] ≈ 0.0078 M → pH ≈ 2.11\n\nThis is a different pH than the previous calculation. However, this approach only considers the first hydrolysis step, whereas Fe³+ can undergo multiple hydrolysis steps, which complicates the matter. The Ksp approach is more accurate for overall solubility.\n\nGiven the discrepancy, it's important to note that the pH calculation might vary based on the hydrolysis constants used. However, using the Ksp method is more appropriate here since it directly relates to the solubility equilibrium.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.27.\n"), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745390358, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4842, prompt_tokens=626, total_tokens=5468, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_anthropic reasoning

The reaction with acid converts OH⁻ to water, effectively removing OH⁻ from the system.

But once all Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved, the Fe³⁺ will undergo hydrolysis:
Fe³⁺ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺

This hydrolysis produces H⁺ ions, which affect the pH. However, since we're using a strong acid, the solution's pH will be determined by both the excess H⁺ from the acid and the H⁺ from Fe³⁺ hydrolysis.

Wait, but if we add exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid (28.1 cm³), there will be no excess H⁺. However, Fe³⁺ hydrolysis will still produce H⁺. So, the pH calculation must account for this hydrolysis.

Alternatively, if we add more acid than required, we might have excess H⁺, but the problem asks for the minimum volume, which should be the stoichiometric amount needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃. However, perhaps even more acid is needed to suppress the OH⁻ concentration sufficiently to dissolve all Fe(OH)₃. Let me re-examine this.

The initial approach assumes stoichiometric reaction, but in reality, the solubility equilibrium must be considered. Let me approach this using the solubility product.

The problem states that we need to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ (0.1 L). Let's first find the concentration of Fe³⁺ in solution once dissolved.

Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol
Concentration of Fe³⁺ in 0.1 L = 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M

The solubility product Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10⁻³⁸

If [Fe³+] is 0.009358 M, then [OH⁻]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+] = (6.3×10⁻³⁸) / 0.009358 ≈ 6.73×10⁻³⁶

Thus, [OH⁻] ≈ (6.73×10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) ≈ 1.88×10⁻¹² M

Then, pH = 14 - (-log[H⁺]) = 14 - (log(1.88×10⁻¹²) / log(10)) → but [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = 1×10⁻¹⁴ / 1.88×10⁻¹² ≈ 5.32×10⁻³ M

pH = -log(5.32×10⁻³) ≈ 2.27

Wait, but this pH is after dissolution. However, how much acid is needed to achieve this [H⁺]?

Wait, perhaps this approach is more accurate. To dissolve Fe(OH)₃, the acid must provide H⁺ to neutralize the OH⁻ ions from Fe(OH)₃ dissolution. But since Fe(OH)₃ is very insoluble, even after adding acid, the Fe³+ will hydrolyze to produce H⁺. Therefore, the total H⁺ required is both to neutralize the OH⁻ from Fe(OH)₃ and to maintain the solution pH such that Fe(OH)₃ remains dissolved.

But maybe the stoichiometric approach is insufficient, and we need to use the Ksp to find the required [H⁺], then compute the acid needed to achieve that pH.

Let me try this method.

We need to dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ into 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.009358 M. Using Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10⁻³⁸

So [OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10⁻³⁸ / 0.009358 ≈ 6.73×10⁻³⁶

[OH⁻] = (6.73×10⁻³⁶)^(1/3) ≈ 1.88×10⁻¹² M

Then, [H⁺] = Kw / [OH⁻] = 1e-14 / 1.88e-12 ≈ 5.32e-3 M → pH ≈ 2.27

Therefore, the pH of the resulting solution would be approximately 2.27.

Now, to find the amount of acid needed to achieve this pH. The acid (HA) is a strong monobasic acid, so it will dissociate completely: HA → H⁺ + A⁻

The total H⁺ in solution comes from two sources: the acid added and the hydrolysis of Fe³+. However, when we add the acid, it will first neutralize the OH⁻ from Fe(OH)₃ dissolution and then contribute to the H⁺ concentration. But this seems a bit circular.

Alternatively, let's consider that the dissolution of Fe(OH)₃ requires H⁺ to neutralize OH⁻. Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ releases 3 moles of OH⁻, which must be neutralized by 3 moles of H⁺. Additionally, the Fe³+ will hydrolyze to produce H⁺. But perhaps the hydrolysis is accounted for in the Ksp expression.

Alternatively, let's model the system.

When we add H⁺ (from the acid) to dissolve Fe(OH)₃:

Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³+ + 3H₂O

This is the dissolution reaction. The amount of H⁺ required is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)₃. Then, once dissolved, Fe³+ will hydrolyze:

Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺

This hydrolysis produces H⁺, but if we have already added H⁺ to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃, the total H⁺ in solution will be the H⁺ from the acid minus the H⁺ consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)₃ plus the H⁺ produced by hydrolysis. Wait, but this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the dissolution reaction (Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³+ + 3H₂O) consumes 3 H⁺ per Fe(OH)₃. Then, the hydrolysis of Fe³+ (Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺) produces 3 H⁺. So, if all Fe(OH)₃ is dissolved by adding exactly 3 moles of H⁺ per mole of Fe(OH)₃, the hydrolysis would produce 3 H⁺, which would exactly offset the H⁺ consumed. Therefore, the net H⁺ would be zero? But that can't be right because the solution would then have Fe³+ and some H⁺ from water autoionization. Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is significant, and even though stoichiometrically the H⁺ consumed and produced cancel out, the actual H⁺ concentration is determined by the hydrolysis equilibrium.

Alternatively, maybe the stoichiometric approach is sufficient for the minimum volume of acid, and the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Let's test this.

Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol

Moles of H⁺ needed for dissolution: 3 × 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol

Volume of 0.1 M acid needed: 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³

So, the minimum volume of acid required is 28.1 cm³. Then, after dissolution, the Fe³+ concentration is 0.009358 M (0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L). The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Fe³+ hydrolysis:

Fe³+ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H⁺

This is a stepwise hydrolysis, but for simplicity, we can consider the overall hydrolysis:

Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺

But the equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+] = Kw^3 / Ksp

Wait, let's derive the expression. The dissolution reaction for Fe(OH)₃ is:

Fe(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 6.3×10⁻³⁸

Hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be written as:

Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃(s) + 3H⁺

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+] = (Kw^3) / Ksp

Because, from the dissolution reaction, [OH⁻]^3 = Ksp / [Fe³+], so [H⁺]^3 = Kw^3 / [OH⁻]^3 = Kw^3 / (Ksp / [Fe³+]) ) = (Kw^3 [Fe³+]) / Ksp

Therefore, K = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+] = Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 ≈ (1e-42) / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-5

Thus, K ≈ 1.587e-5 = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+]

Given [Fe³+] = 0.009358 M, then:

[H⁺]^3 = K × [Fe³+] = 1.587e-5 × 0.009358 ≈ 1.485e-7

[H⁺] ≈ (1.485e-7)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3e-3 M → pH ≈ -log(5.3e-3) ≈ 2.28

Therefore, the pH of the solution is approximately 2.28.

But wait, this calculation assumes that the only source of H⁺ is the hydrolysis of Fe³+. However, the acid added is a strong acid, which would contribute H⁺. But in the stoichiometric calculation, we added exactly the H⁺ needed to dissolve the Fe(OH)₃ (i.e., 0.002807 mol H⁺). Then, when Fe³+ hydrolyzes, it produces H⁺. But if we added exactly the H⁺ needed to dissolve Fe(OH)₃, then the H⁺ from hydrolysis would be additional. However, in reality, the dissolution reaction consumes H⁺ (3 H⁺ per Fe(OH)₃), and the hydrolysis produces H⁺ (3 H⁺ per Fe³+). So, net H⁺ would be the H⁺ from hydrolysis minus the H⁺ consumed in dissolution. Wait, but that seems contradictory. Let me clarify.

The dissolution process requires adding H⁺ to neutralize the OH⁻ from Fe(OH)₃. Once dissolved, Fe³+ hydrolyzes to produce H⁺. So, the H⁺ added via acid is consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)₃, and the H⁺ from hydrolysis is a new source. However, since the dissolution and hydrolysis are reciprocal reactions, perhaps the net effect is that the H⁺ from hydrolysis is what's present in solution, and the H⁺ from the acid is entirely consumed.

Wait, perhaps the key is that dissolving Fe(OH)₃ with H⁺ converts the solid into Fe³+ and water. The Fe³+ then hydrolyzes to produce H⁺. The amount of H⁺ produced by hydrolysis would be equal to the amount consumed in dissolution only if the solution is at equilibrium. But since the acid is strong and we’re adding it to dissolve Fe(OH)₃, the H⁺ from the acid is used up in the dissolution, and the resulting solution's H⁺ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Wait, but that can't be exactly true. Let's model the system step by step.

1. Add n moles of H⁺ (from acid) to dissolve Fe(OH)₃.

The reaction is Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Fe³+ + 3H₂O. The stoichiometry requires 3 moles of H⁺ per mole of Fe(OH)₃. So, if we have m moles of Fe(OH)₃, we need 3m moles of H⁺.

After dissolution, we have m moles of Fe³+ in solution, and 3m moles of H⁺ have been consumed.

But since we added n moles of H⁺, the remaining H⁺ is n - 3m. However, Fe³+ will hydrolyze to produce H⁺:

Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺

Let’s denote the extent of hydrolysis as x. Then, the amount of H⁺ produced is 3x. However, since Fe(OH)₃ is a solid, its activity is 1, so the equilibrium expression is:

K = [H⁺]^3 / [Fe³+]

From earlier, K ≈ 1.587e-5

The initial concentration after dissolution (before hydrolysis) is [Fe³+] = m / V, and [H⁺] = (n - 3m) / V. But wait, if we added exactly n = 3m, then the initial [H⁺] would be zero. However, hydrolysis will produce H⁺. But if n > 3m, there would be excess H⁺. If n = 3m, then [H⁺] is determined solely by hydrolysis. If n < 3m, then not all Fe(OH)₃ would dissolve.

The problem states that we need to dissolve all 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃, so n must be at least 3m. However, the minimum volume corresponds to n = 3m, i.e., stoichiometric amount. Therefore, after dissolution, [H⁺] is determined by hydrolysis of Fe³+.

Therefore, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+ as calculated earlier (~2.28). The volume of acid required is 28.1 cm³.

But wait, let's cross-verify. If we add exactly the stoichiometric amount of H⁺ (28.1 cm³ of 0.1 M acid), then after dissolution, the solution contains Fe³+ and the anion from the acid (e.g., Cl⁻ if HCl is used). The Fe³+ hydrolyzes to produce H⁺, which contributes to the pH. The initial H⁺ from the acid is all consumed in dissolving Fe(OH)₃, so the only H⁺ present is from hydrolysis. Thus, the pH calculation based on hydrolysis is correct.

Alternatively, if excess acid is added, there would be leftover H⁺, leading to a lower pH. But since we're asked for the minimum volume (i.e., no excess acid), the pH is solely due to Fe³+ hydrolysis.

Therefore, the answers should be:

Minimum volume of acid: 28.1 cm³

pH of the solution: approximately 2.28

But let's check if the Ksp approach aligns with this. If we dissolve 0.009358 M Fe³+, the required [OH⁻] is 1.88e-12, leading to [H+] = 5.32e-3, pH 2.27. This matches the hydrolysis calculation. Therefore, both methods confirm the pH is around 2.27-2.28.

Thus, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.28.

However, let's check the exact value for Ksp. Different sources might report slightly different Ksp values for Fe(OH)₃. For example, some sources cite Ksp as low as 2.79×10⁻³⁹. If a different Ksp is used, the pH would change slightly. But assuming the given Ksp is 6.3×10⁻³⁸ (as per my initial calculation), the pH would be around 2.27.

Also, considering significant figures, the given data (0.1 g, 100 cm³, 0.1 M) suggest maybe two significant figures. So, the volume would be 28 cm³ and pH 2.3. But let's check the exact calculation.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃: Fe = 55.85, O = 16.00×3 = 48.00, H = 1.008×3 = 3.024. Total = 55.85 + 48.00 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol. So, 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol.

H⁺ needed: 3 × 0.0009357 = 0.002807 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³ → 28.1 cm³ when rounded to three significant figures.

For pH, using [H+] = 5.32e-3 → pH = -log(5.32e-3) ≈ 2.274, which rounds to 2.27.

But perhaps the problem expects using a more precise Ksp value or a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in K expression.

Alternatively, another approach: After dissolving Fe(OH)₃ with the stoichiometric amount of acid, the solution contains Fe³+ and the conjugate base of the strong acid (e.g., Cl⁻). Since the acid is strong, the conjugate base does not affect pH. The pH is then determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe³+ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H⁺

The equilibrium expression for the first hydrolysis step is:

K₁ = [Fe(OH)²+][H⁺] / [Fe³+]

The value of K₁ for Fe³+ hydrolysis is approximately 6.5×10⁻³. However, considering multiple hydrolysis steps complicates the calculation. But if we use the simplified overall hydrolysis producing 3 H⁺ ions per Fe³+, then using K = Kw^3 / Ksp as before gives a more accurate result.

Alternatively, if using K₁ = 6.5×10⁻³, the pH calculation would differ. Let me see.

Assuming only the first hydrolysis step:

Fe³+ + H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)²+ + H⁺; K₁ = 6.5×10⁻³

Let the concentration of Fe³+ be 0.009358 M. Let x be the concentration of H⁺ produced.

At equilibrium:

[Fe(OH)²+] = x

[H⁺] = x

[Fe³+] = 0.009358 - x

Thus,

K₁ = (x)(x) / (0.009358 - x) ≈ x² / 0.009358 = 6.5e-3

Solving for x² = 6.5e-3 × 0.009358 ≈ 6.083e-5 → x ≈ √(6.083e-5) ≈ 7.8e-3 M

Thus, [H⁺] ≈ 0.0078 M → pH ≈ 2.11

This is a different pH than the previous calculation. However, this approach only considers the first hydrolysis step, whereas Fe³+ can undergo multiple hydrolysis steps, which complicates the matter. The Ksp approach is more accurate for overall solubility.

Given the discrepancy, it's important to note that the pH calculation might vary based on the hydrolysis constants used. However, using the Ksp method is more appropriate here since it directly relates to the solubility equilibrium.

In conclusion, the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH of the resulting solution is approximately 2.27.

Let\'s proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the exact amount of acid needed. As before, 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ is 0.0009358 mol. Each mole requires 3 H⁺, so 0.002807 mol H⁺. The acid is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. So, approximately 28.1 cm³. But perhaps we need to account for dilution. The total volume is 100 cm³, so the acid (28.1 cm³) is part of that. Wait, but the problem states "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So, the total solution after adding acid and Fe(OH)₃ must be 100 cm³. Therefore, the volume of acid added plus the volume of Fe(OH)₃ solution (if any) equals 100 cm³. But Fe(OH)₃ is a solid here, so when you dissolve it in acid, the volume contributed by the solid is negligible, so the total volume is approximately equal to the volume of acid plus the water (if any). However, the problem says "100 cm³ total volume," so the acid volume plus any water added would make 100 cm³. But since the acid is being added as a solution, and the final volume is 100 cm³, the volume of acid required is perhaps less than 100 cm³, and the rest is water. Wait, but the question is phrased as "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to prepare the solution," so perhaps the acid is added to the solution to reach 100 cm³? Or is the total volume 100 cm³ composed of acid and Fe(OH)₃?\n\nWait, the problem states: "dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm³) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution..." So, perhaps the 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in a total solution volume of 100 cm³, which is made by adding some volume of 0.1 M acid and then diluted with water. So, the total volume is 100 cm³, which includes the acid volume and water. Therefore, the moles of acid required is still 0.002807 mol, but since the acid is 0.1 M, the volume of acid needed is 28.07 cm³, and then the rest (100 - 28.07 = 71.93 cm³) is water. However, when you dilute the acid, the concentration of H+ would change. Wait, but in the reaction, the H+ is consumed to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So, actually, the H+ from the acid is reacting stoichiometrically with the OH- from Fe(OH)3, and the remaining solution would contain Fe³+ and the conjugate base of the strong acid (Cl⁻, NO3⁻, etc.), as well as any excess H+ or OH-.\n\nBut since we are adding exactly the amount of H+ needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3, there should be no excess H+ or OH- from the neutralization. However, Fe³+ is a strong Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water:\n\nFe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+\n\nThis hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions, which will lower the pH. Therefore, even after neutralization, the solution will be acidic due to Fe³+ hydrolysis. Therefore, the pH is determined by this hydrolysis.\n\nBut first, let\'s confirm the volume. If the total solution is 100 cm³, and the acid is 0.1 M, then the moles of H+ added is 0.1 M * V (in liters). This must equal 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. The moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Therefore, moles H+ needed = 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol. Therefore, volume of acid needed is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. So, the minimum volume of acid is approximately 28.1 cm³. The rest of the solution (100 - 28.07 ≈ 71.93 cm³) is water. Therefore, the answer for the volume is 28.1 cm³. But let me check if the dissolution is possible with this amount.\n\nBut wait, when we add 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M H+ to the Fe(OH)3, the total volume is 100 cm³, but the concentration of Fe³+ would be 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M. Then, Fe³+ will hydrolyze:\n\nFe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is K = [H+]³ / [Fe³+] = Kw³ / Ksp, where Kw is 1e-14 and Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 6.3e-38.\n\nWait, let\'s think. The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is [Fe³+][OH⁻]³ = 6.3e-38. The hydrolysis reaction of Fe³+ is:\n\nFe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [H+]³ / [Fe³+] = (Kw³)/Ksp.\n\nSince Kw = 1e-14, so K = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-05.\n\nTherefore, K ≈ 1.587e-05.\n\nSo, the expression is [H+]³ / [Fe³+] = 1.587e-05.\n\nGiven that [Fe³+] is 0.009358 M, let\'s plug into the equation:\n\n[H+]³ = 1.587e-05 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.587e-05 * 9.358e-03 ≈ 1.484e-07\n\nTherefore, [H+] ≈ cube root(1.484e-07) ≈ (1.484e-07)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3e-03 M\n\nTherefore, pH = -log(5.3e-03) ≈ 2.28\n\nSo, the pH of the solution would be approximately 2.28. Therefore, even though we added the stoichiometric amount of acid, the hydrolysis of Fe³+ leads to an acidic solution with pH around 2.28.\n\nBut let me verify the calculations again.\n\nFirst, Ksp Fe(OH)3 = 6.3e-38. The hydrolysis reaction is Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. The equilibrium expression here is K = [H+]³ / [Fe³+]. Alternatively, considering the dissolution of Fe(OH)3: Fe(OH)3 ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3. Therefore, if we reverse this and combine with water autoionization:\n\nFe³+ + 3OH⁻ ⇌ Fe(OH)3, K = 1/Ksp.\n\nBut the hydrolysis reaction is Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. So, combining the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 with the autoionization of water:\n\nFe(OH)3 ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp.\n\nThen, for each OH⁻, H+ + OH⁻ ⇌ H2O, Kw⁻¹ = 1e14.\n\nTherefore, combining these:\n\nFe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction would be K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = (Kw^3)/Ksp.\n\nTherefore, K = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-05.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nGiven that, in the solution, [Fe³+] is 0.009358 M (0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L). So, plugging into K expression:\n\n[H+]³ = K * [Fe³+] = 1.587e-05 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.484e-07.\n\nSo, [H+] ≈ (1.484e-07)^(1/3). Let\'s compute this:\n\n1.484e-07 is 1.484 x 10^-7. The cube root of 10^-7 is 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^-2.333 ≈ 4.64e-3. Then multiplied by (1.484)^(1/3). The cube root of 1.484 is roughly 1.14. Therefore, 1.14 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.3e-3, which gives [H+] ≈ 5.3e-3, so pH ≈ 2.28.\n\nTherefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.\n\nBut wait, let\'s check if this pH would cause precipitation. If the pH is 2.28, then [H+] = 5.3e-3, so [OH⁻] = Kw / [H+] = 1e-14 / 5.3e-3 ≈ 1.89e-12.\n\nThen, the ion product Q = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 0.009358 * (1.89e-12)^3 ≈ 0.009358 * 6.75e-36 ≈ 6.32e-38.\n\nWhich is equal to Ksp (6.3e-38). Therefore, the solution is at equilibrium, meaning that Fe(OH)3 is just about to precipitate. Therefore, adding exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid brings the solution to the brink of precipitation, but since we have dissolved the Fe(OH)3, perhaps the solution is just saturated. However, in reality, the dissolution might require a bit more acid to shift the equilibrium completely.

Therefore, this should be the minimum volume required.\n\nBut another perspective: If we add exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid, the Fe³+ concentration is 0.009358 M, and the pH is 2.28. Since Q=Ksp, the solution is saturated, and no precipitation occurs. Therefore, 28.07 cm³ is indeed the minimum volume required.\n\nAlternatively, if we added less acid, there would be undissolved Fe(OH)3, and the solution would have lower [Fe³+], but the problem states that we need to dissolve 0.1 g, so we need enough acid to convert all Fe(OH)3 to Fe³+. Therefore, stoichiometrically, 28.07 cm³ is required.\n\nTherefore, the answer for the minimum volume is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH is approximately 2.28.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s any other factor.

To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃:**
   - Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ = 55.85 + 3*(16.00 + 1.01) = 106.88 g/mol
   - Moles of Fe(OH)₃ = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol

2. **Determine the moles of H⁺ required:**
   - Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺ for neutralization.
   - Moles of H⁺ = 3 * 0.0009358 mol ≈ 0.002807 mol

3. **Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed:**
   - Volume = moles of H⁺ / concentration = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³

4. **Determine the pH of the resulting solution:**
   - Concentration of Fe³+ in 100 cm³ solution = 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M
   - Fe³+ hydrolyzes in water: Fe³+ + 3H₂O ⇌ Fe(OH)₃ + 3H⁺
   - Using the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)₃ = 6.3×10⁻³⁸ and Kw = 1×10⁻¹⁴:
     - Equilibrium constant K = (Kw³) / Ksp = (1×10⁻¹⁴)³ / 6.3×10⁻³⁸ ≈ 1.587×10⁻⁵
     - [H+]³ = K * [Fe³+] = 1.587×10⁻⁵ * 0.009358 ≈ 1.484×10⁻⁷
     - [H+] ≈ (1.484×10⁻⁷)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3×10⁻³ M
     - pH = -log(5.3×10⁻³) ≈ 2.28

### Final Answer
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.28}.

Therefore, even after neutralization, the solution might still be acidic due to Fe³+ hydrolysis.

Thus, the stoichiometric amount of acid is required to dissolve Fe(OH)₃, but the pH of the solution would be influenced by the Fe³+ hydrolysis. Let's proceed step by step.

First, compute the exact amount of acid needed. As before, 0.1 g Fe(OH)₃ is 0.0009358 mol. Each mole requires 3 H⁺, so 0.002807 mol H⁺. The acid is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. So, approximately 28.1 cm³. But perhaps we need to account for dilution. The total volume is 100 cm³, so the acid (28.1 cm³) is part of that. Wait, but the problem states "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So, the total solution after adding acid and Fe(OH)₃ must be 100 cm³. Therefore, the volume of acid added plus the volume of Fe(OH)₃ solution (if any) equals 100 cm³. But Fe(OH)₃ is a solid here, so when you dissolve it in acid, the volume contributed by the solid is negligible, so the total volume is approximately equal to the volume of acid plus the water (if any). However, the problem says "100 cm³ total volume," so the acid volume plus any water added would make 100 cm³. But since the acid is being added as a solution, and the final volume is 100 cm³, the volume of acid required is perhaps less than 100 cm³, and the rest is water. Wait, but the question is phrased as "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to prepare the solution," so perhaps the acid is added to the solution to reach 100 cm³? Or is the total volume 100 cm³ composed of acid and Fe(OH)₃?

Wait, the problem states: "dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm³) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution..." So, perhaps the 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in a total solution volume of 100 cm³, which is made by adding some volume of 0.1 M acid and then diluted with water. So, the total volume is 100 cm³, which includes the acid volume and water. Therefore, the moles of acid required is still 0.002807 mol, but since the acid is 0.1 M, the volume of acid needed is 28.07 cm³, and then the rest (100 - 28.07 = 71.93 cm³) is water. However, when you dilute the acid, the concentration of H+ would change. Wait, but in the reaction, the H+ is consumed to neutralize the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So, actually, the H+ from the acid is reacting stoichiometrically with the OH- from Fe(OH)3, and the remaining solution would contain Fe³+ and the conjugate base of the strong acid (Cl⁻, NO3⁻, etc.), as well as any excess H+ or OH-.

But since we are adding exactly the amount of H+ needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3, there should be no excess H+ or OH- from the neutralization. However, Fe³+ is a strong Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

This hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions, which will lower the pH. Therefore, even after neutralization, the solution will be acidic due to Fe³+ hydrolysis. Therefore, the pH is determined by this hydrolysis.

But first, let's confirm the volume. If the total solution is 100 cm³, and the acid is 0.1 M, then the moles of H+ added is 0.1 M * V (in liters). This must equal 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. The moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Therefore, moles H+ needed = 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 mol. Therefore, volume of acid needed is 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. So, the minimum volume of acid is approximately 28.1 cm³. The rest of the solution (100 - 28.07 ≈ 71.93 cm³) is water. Therefore, the answer for the volume is 28.1 cm³. But let me check if the dissolution is possible with this amount.

But wait, when we add 28.07 cm³ of 0.1 M H+ to the Fe(OH)3, the total volume is 100 cm³, but the concentration of Fe³+ would be 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M. Then, Fe³+ will hydrolyze:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

The equilibrium expression is K = [H+]³ / [Fe³+] = Kw³ / Ksp, where Kw is 1e-14 and Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 6.3e-38.

Wait, let's think. The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is [Fe³+][OH⁻]³ = 6.3e-38. The hydrolysis reaction of Fe³+ is:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+

So, the equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = [H+]³ / [Fe³+] = (Kw³)/Ksp.

Since Kw = 1e-14, so K = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-05.

Therefore, K ≈ 1.587e-05.

So, the expression is [H+]³ / [Fe³+] = 1.587e-05.

Given that [Fe³+] is 0.009358 M, let's plug into the equation:

[H+]³ = 1.587e-05 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.587e-05 * 9.358e-03 ≈ 1.484e-07

Therefore, [H+] ≈ cube root(1.484e-07) ≈ (1.484e-07)^(1/3) ≈ 5.3e-03 M

Therefore, pH = -log(5.3e-03) ≈ 2.28

So, the pH of the solution would be approximately 2.28. Therefore, even though we added the stoichiometric amount of acid, the hydrolysis of Fe³+ leads to an acidic solution with pH around 2.28.

But let me verify the calculations again.

First, Ksp Fe(OH)3 = 6.3e-38. The hydrolysis reaction is Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. The equilibrium expression here is K = [H+]³ / [Fe³+]. Alternatively, considering the dissolution of Fe(OH)3: Fe(OH)3 ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3. Therefore, if we reverse this and combine with water autoionization:

Fe³+ + 3OH⁻ ⇌ Fe(OH)3, K = 1/Ksp.

But the hydrolysis reaction is Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. So, combining the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 with the autoionization of water:

Fe(OH)3 ⇌ Fe³+ + 3OH⁻, Ksp.

Then, for each OH⁻, H+ + OH⁻ ⇌ H2O, Kw⁻¹ = 1e14.

Therefore, combining these:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The equilibrium constant for this reaction would be K = [H+]^3 / [Fe³+] = (Kw^3)/Ksp.

Therefore, K = (1e-14)^3 / 6.3e-38 = 1e-42 / 6.3e-38 ≈ 1.587e-05.

So, correct.

Given that, in the solution, [Fe³+] is 0.009358 M (0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L). So, plugging into K expression:

[H+]³ = K * [Fe³+] = 1.587e-05 * 0.009358 ≈ 1.484e-07.

So, [H+] ≈ (1.484e-07)^(1/3). Let's compute this:

1.484e-07 is 1.484 x 10^-7. The cube root of 10^-7 is 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^-2.333 ≈ 4.64e-3. Then multiplied by (1.484)^(1/3). The cube root of 1.484 is roughly 1.14. Therefore, 1.14 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.3e-3, which gives [H+] ≈ 5.3e-3, so pH ≈ 2.28.

Therefore, the pH is approximately 2.28.

But wait, let's check if this pH would cause precipitation. If the pH is 2.28, then [H+] = 5.3e-3, so [OH⁻] = Kw / [H+] = 1e-14 / 5.3e-3 ≈ 1.89e-12.

Then, the ion product Q = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3 = 0.009358 * (1.89e-12)^3 ≈ 0.009358 * 6.75e-36 ≈ 6.32e-38.

Which is equal to Ksp (6.3e-38). Therefore, the solution is at equilibrium, meaning that Fe(OH)3 is just about to precipitate. Therefore, adding exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid brings the solution to the brink of precipitation, but since we have dissolved the Fe(OH)3, perhaps the solution is just saturated. However, in reality, the dissolution might require a bit more acid to shift the equilibrium completely. But according to the stoichiometric calculation, 28.07 cm³ is sufficient, and the resulting solution has pH ≈ 2.28, which is just enough to prevent precipitation (since Q=Ksp). Therefore, this should be the minimum volume required.

But another perspective: If we add exactly the stoichiometric amount of acid, the Fe³+ concentration is 0.009358 M, and the pH is 2.28. Since Q=Ksp, the solution is saturated, and no precipitation occurs. Therefore, 28.07 cm³ is indeed the minimum volume required.

Alternatively, if we added less acid, there would be undissolved Fe(OH)3, and the solution would have lower [Fe³+], but the problem states that we need to dissolve 0.1 g, so we need enough acid to convert all Fe(OH)3 to Fe³+. Therefore, stoichiometrically, 28.07 cm³ is required.

Therefore, the answer for the minimum volume is approximately 28.1 cm³, and the pH is approximately 2.28.

But let me check if there's any other factor. For example, activity coefficients, but at such low concentrations, perhaps the approximation holds. Also, the Ksp value for Fe(OH)3 can vary depending on the source. Some sources cite different values. For example, sometimes Fe(OH)3 is given with Ksp around 1e-39, but in the problem, since no Ksp is provided, I have to use the commonly accepted value, which I believe is around 6e-38. However, if another Ksp is used, the pH would change. But since the problem does not provide Ksp, we proceed with standard value.

Therefore, the final answers are:

Minimum volume of acid: 28.1 cm³

pH of the resulting solution: approximately 2.28

But let me check once again the stoichiometry:

0.1 g Fe(OH)3 / 106.88 g/mol = 0.0009358 mol

H+ needed: 0.0009358 * 3 = 0.002807 mol

Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³ ≈ 28.1 cm³

Yes, correct.

Then, the concentration of Fe³+ is 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M

Hydrolysis leads to [H+] ≈ 5.3e-3, pH ≈ 2.28

Therefore, the answers should be:

Volume: 28.1 cm³

pH: 2.28

But let me check if the pH calculation is correct.

[H+] = 5.3e-3 M

pH = -log(5.3e-3) ≈ 2.28

Yes.

Therefore, the final answers are approximately 28.1 cm³ and pH 2.28.

**Final Answer**
The minimum volume of acid required is \boxed{28.1} cm³ and the pH of the resulting solution is \boxed{2.28}.
