# Original Question

What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 °C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

The concentration of calcium ions in the solution can be determined using the stability constant (K) of the Ca-EDTA complex. The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}
\]

Given:
- \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \)
- \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \)

The stability constant expression is:
\[
K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Since the dissociation of the complex produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), let \( x = [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] \). Assuming \( x \ll 0.02 \), we approximate \( [\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Considering significant figures (\( K \) has 1 significant figure, and \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) has 2), the final answer is rounded to **1 significant figure**:

\[
\boxed{6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}}
\]

# DeepSeek reasoning (via openrouter)

Okay, so I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex means that EDTA and calcium are in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since the solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA, that should be the concentration of the complex itself. The problem states the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in the correct form to fully complex with calcium, so we don't have to worry about protonation states of EDTA. That simplifies things because the stability constant given is under these ideal pH conditions.

The stability constant K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction is:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

And the stability constant K is given by:

K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

Since the solution is stoichiometric, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ that formed the complex should be equal initially. Wait, but once the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ would be equal because they are produced in a 1:1 ratio. However, since K is very large (5x10^10), the complex is very stable, so the dissociation should be minimal. That suggests that the concentrations of free Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are very small.

Let me define the variables. Let the concentration of free Ca²⁺ be x. Then the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ would also be x, because they dissociate in a 1:1 ratio. The concentration of the complex would then be 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x is going to be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That should simplify the calculation.

So plugging into the stability constant equation:

K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

Given that K is 5x10^10, we can set up:

5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = (2/5) x 10^-12 = 0.4 x 10^-12 = 4x10^-13

Then x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is sqrt(4) x sqrt(10^-13) = 2 x 10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is the same as 10^(-6) x 10^(-0.5) = 10^-6 x (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 10^-6 x 0.3162 ≈ 3.162x10^-7. So multiplying by 2 gives approximately 6.324x10^-7 M. Therefore, x ≈ 6.32x10^-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Let's see:

x² = 4x10^-13

So x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. Hmm, 10^-6.5 is indeed equal to 10^(-6 - 0.5) = 10^-6 / 10^0.5. Since 10^0.5 is approximately 3.1623, so 10^-6.5 ≈ 3.1623x10^-7. Then 2 times that is approximately 6.3245x10^-7. So x ≈ 6.32x10^-7 M.

But maybe I can write it in a more precise form. Alternatively, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which can be written as 2x10^(-13/2) = 2x10^-6.5. However, typically, we might express this in scientific notation with an integer exponent. Since 10^-6.5 = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 ≈ 10^-6 * 0.31623, so 2*0.31623 is approximately 0.63246, so 0.63246x10^-6, which is 6.3246x10^-7. So 6.32x10^-7 M is correct.

But let me verify the setup again. The initial assumption is that the complex dissociates into Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻, each at concentration x. Since the complex is 0.02 M, then the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M because x is negligible. Then K = 0.02/(x²). Solving for x gives sqrt(0.02/K). Plugging in K = 5x10^10:

x = sqrt(0.02 / (5x10^10)) = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, if I use exact exponents:

0.02 is 2x10^-2.

So 2x10^-2 divided by 5x10^10 is (2/5)x10^-12 = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13. Then square root is 2x10^-6.5. So that's correct.

Expressed in decimal form, 10^-6.5 is 3.1623x10^-7, so 2x3.1623x10^-7 ≈ 6.3246x10^-7. So approximately 6.32x10^-7 M.

But maybe the answer expects a more precise value. Let's calculate 10^-0.5 exactly. 10^0.5 is sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16227766017, so 1/sqrt(10) ≈ 0.316227766017. Therefore, 10^-6.5 = 0.316227766017x10^-6. Multiply that by 2 gives 0.63245553203x10^-6, which is 6.3245553203x10^-7. Rounding to two decimal places would be 6.32x10^-7. If we want to use significant figures, since K was given as 5x10^10 (one significant figure?) Wait, the problem states KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. The 5 is one significant figure, but sometimes in these problems, the stability constants might be considered as having more, but the way it's written, 5x10^10 is one significant figure. The concentration is given as 0.02 M, which is two significant figures. So the answer should probably be rounded to one significant figure, but maybe two.

Wait, 0.02 M has two significant figures. 5x10^10 is one. When multiplying or dividing, the number of significant figures is determined by the least number of significant figures in the input. So here, 0.02 / 5x10^10: 0.02 is two, 5x10^10 is one. So the result should have one significant figure. But since we take the square root, does that affect the significant figures? Hmm. The square root of a number with one significant figure would still have one significant figure. So maybe the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. But let's check.

Wait, 5x10^10 is one significant figure. 0.02 is two. So when we calculate x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13, that's one significant figure because of the 5x10^10. Then the square root would be 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but with one significant figure, that would be 6x10^-7.

But maybe since 0.02 has two, and K has one, the answer should be one. But I need to confirm. Let's see, the rules are a bit ambiguous here. If 0.02 is two sig figs and K is one, then when dividing, the result has one sig fig. Then when taking the square root, the number of sig figs stays the same. So sqrt(4x10^-13) is 6x10^-7 when rounded to one sig fig. Therefore, the answer would be 6x10^-7 M.

But maybe the problem expects two sig figs because 0.02 has two. However, since K is given as one, it's safer to go with one. But sometimes in such problems, constants are considered to have more significant figures. The problem states KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. If that 5 is exact, then maybe it's one sig fig. So perhaps the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. However, in many textbooks, stability constants are often given with one or two significant figures, but in calculations, sometimes they are taken as exact for the purposes of the problem. The question is, does the answer need to consider sig figs? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe we can present the answer as 6.3x10^-7 M, acknowledging two sig figs from 0.02, but since K is one, maybe not. Alternatively, the answer might be presented as 6x10^-7 M.

Wait, let's check with exact calculation:

x = sqrt(0.02 / (5x10^10)) = sqrt((2e-2)/(5e10)) = sqrt(2/(5e12)) = sqrt(2/5)*1e-6

sqrt(2/5) ≈ sqrt(0.4) ≈ 0.632455, so 0.632455e-6 ≈ 6.32455e-7, which is approximately 6.32e-7.

So if we take three significant figures, 6.32e-7, but since K is one sig fig, and concentration is two, maybe the answer is two sig figs, 6.3e-7. But this is getting into a bit of a debate. In an exam setting, perhaps they expect the answer as 6.3x10^-7 M. Alternatively, maybe they just want the exact expression, like 2x10^-6.5 M, but that's unconventional. More likely, they want the numerical value.

Alternatively, let's see if there's another approach. Maybe using the formula for the concentration of metal ion in a 1:1 complex:

[Ca²⁺] = sqrt([Ca-EDTA] / K)

But wait, the formula would be [Ca²⁺] = sqrt([Ca-EDTA]/(K)), but actually, from the equilibrium expression:

K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA])

Since [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA] = x,

K = (0.02)/x² => x = sqrt(0.02/K)

Which is the same as before. So x = sqrt(0.02/(5e10)) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

But converting 2e-6.5 to decimal exponent:

6.5 = 6 + 0.5, so 10^-6.5 = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 ≈ 1e-6 * 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-7

Multiply by 2: 6.3246e-7, so approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Given that, I think the appropriate answer is 6.3x10^-7 M, keeping two significant figures because the concentration was given as 0.02 M (two sig figs), even though K was one. But in some cases, constants are considered exact, so the 5x10^10 might be taken as exact, allowing the answer to have two sig figs. Alternatively, maybe the answer is expected to be 6x10^-7 M. Hmm. The problem says "we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25°C". So perhaps all other conditions are ideal, and K is given as 5e10, which is one sig fig. So maybe the answer should be one sig fig.

But to check, let me see similar problems. For example, if you have a 1:1 complex with K = 1e10 and concentration 0.01 M, then [M] = sqrt(0.01 / 1e10) = sqrt(1e-12) = 1e-6. So in that case, the answer is 1e-6 M, one sig fig. So following that, here K is 5e10 (one sig fig), concentration 0.02 (two sig figs). So the answer would be sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7, but with one sig fig, it's 6e-7.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects two sig figs because 0.02 has two, and the K, even though written as 5e10, might be considered as 5.0e10, implying two sig figs. But it's written as 5x10^10, which is typically one sig fig. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. In the absence of more information, perhaps we should go with two sig figs because the concentration has two, and K is given as 5x10^10 which could be considered as one, but maybe in the context of the problem, since pH is ideal, they might expect using the given values as exact. Wait, but no, K is an equilibrium constant, which is always given with a certain precision. Unless stated otherwise, we take them as is. If they want an exact answer, they might specify. But in most textbooks, when K is given as 5x10^10, it's considered one significant figure.

Given that, then the answer should be one sig fig: 6x10^-7 M. But I need to check my calculation again. If I use 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004e-10 = 4e-13. Square root is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.3e-7. So if we round to one sig fig, that's 6e-7. If two sig figs, 6.3e-7. The problem says "what is the concentration", without specifying sig figs, but in chemistry, usually, you go with the least number of sig figs from the given data. Since K is one sig fig and concentration is two, the answer should have one. So 6x10^-7 M.

But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me see another way. Suppose we write all steps with proper sig figs.

Given:

[Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M (two sig figs)

K = 5x10^10 (one sig fig)

So x = sqrt(0.02 / 5x10^10) = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5

But 0.02 / 5x10^10: 0.02 is 2.0x10^-2, so 2.0x10^-2 / 5.0x10^10 = (2.0 / 5.0) x 10^-12 = 0.4x10^-12 = 4.0x10^-13. Here, 2.0 (two sig figs) divided by 5.0 (two sig figs?) Wait, but 5x10^10 is one sig fig. So 5x10^10 is considered as 5.0x10^10 (one sig fig). Then 2.0x10^-2 (two sig figs) divided by 5.0x10^10 (one sig fig) would result in 0.4x10^-12 (one sig fig). Then sqrt(0.4x10^-12) = sqrt(4.0x10^-13) = 2.0x10^-6.5. But sqrt(4.0x10^-13) is 2.0x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but since 4.0x10^-13 has one sig fig (from the division step), then the square root would have one sig fig, so 6x10^-7.

Therefore, the answer should be 6x10^-7 M with one significant figure.

But I need to confirm once more. If 0.02 has two sig figs and K has one, then when dividing, the number with the least sig figs (one) dictates the result has one sig fig. Then the square root of a number with one sig fig still has one sig fig. Therefore, the final answer is 6x10^-7 M.

Alternatively, if K were written as 5.0x10^10 (two sig figs), then the answer would have two sig figs. But as it's written, 5x10^10 is one. So yes, 6x10^-7 M.

But just to be thorough, let's compute it precisely:

x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(0.02 / 50000000000) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32455532e-7

Rounded to one significant figure: 6e-7

Rounded to two significant figures: 6.3e-7

Given the problem's data, I think the appropriate answer is 6x10^-7 M.

But I want to check if there's another approach where maybe the assumption that [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻] is valid. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ in a 1:1 ratio, their concentrations should be equal. Yes, that's correct. So the approach is right.

Another way to think: because K is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so x is very small. Therefore, the approximation 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 is valid. Hence, the calculation holds.

Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is 6x10^-7 M.

Okay, so I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant (KCa-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex means that EDTA and calcium are in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since the solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA, that should be the concentration of the complex itself. The problem states the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in the correct form to fully complex with calcium, so we don't have to worry about protonation states of EDTA. That simplifies things because the stability constant given is under these ideal pH conditions.

The stability constant K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction is:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

And the stability constant K is given by:

K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

Since the solution is stoichiometric, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ that formed the complex should be equal initially. Wait, but once the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ would be equal because they are produced in a 1:1 ratio. However, since K is very large (5x10^10), the complex is very stable, so the dissociation should be minimal. That suggests that the concentrations of free Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are very small.

Let me define the variables. Let the concentration of free Ca²⁺ be x. Then the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ would also be x, because they dissociate in a 1:1 ratio. The concentration of the complex would then be 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x is going to be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That should simplify the calculation.

So plugging into the stability constant equation:

K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

Given that K is 5x10^10, we can set up:

5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = (2/5) x 10^-12 = 0.4 x 10^-12 = 4x10^-13

Then x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is sqrt(4) x sqrt(10^-13) = 2 x 10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is the same as 10^(-6) x 10^(-0.5) = 10^-6 x (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 10^-6 x 0.3162 ≈ 3.162x10^-7. So multiplying by 2 gives approximately 6.324x10^-7 M. Therefore, x ≈ 6.32x10^-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Let's see:

x² = 4x10^-13

So x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. Hmm, 10^-6.5 is indeed equal to 10^(-6 - 0.5) = 10^-6 / 10^0.5. Since 10^0.5 is approximately 3.1623, so 10^-6.5 ≈ 3.1623x10^-7. Then 2 times that is approximately 6.3245x10^-7. So x ≈ 6.32x10^-7 M.

But maybe I can write it in a more precise form. Alternatively, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which can be written as 2x10^(-13/2) = 2x10^-6.5. However, typically, we might express this in scientific notation with an integer exponent. Since 10^-6.5 = 10^-6 * 10^-0.5 ≈ 10^-6 * 0.31623, so 2*0.31623 is approximately 0.6324

I need to determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The solution is at an ideal pH and 25°C, with a stability constant (KCa-EDTA) of 5x10^10.

EDTA is a chelating agent that forms 1:1 complexes with metal ions like calcium. Since the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex and the pH is ideal, EDTA is in the appropriate form to fully complex with calcium, meaning we don't need to consider protonation states of EDTA.

The stability constant K represents the equilibrium constant for the complex formation:
Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

The stability constant expression is:
K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

In a stoichiometric solution, when the complex dissociates, Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are produced in equal amounts. Given the very large K value (5x10^10), the complex is highly stable with minimal dissociation.

Let's define x as the concentration of free Ca²⁺. Due to the 1:1 dissociation ratio, the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ would also be x. The complex concentration would be 0.02 - x, but since K is so large, x will be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Substituting into the stability constant equation:
K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

Setting this equal to the given K value:
5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²:
x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = (2/5) x 10^-12 = 0.4 x 10^-12 = 4x10^-13

Taking the square root:
x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5

Converting this to standard scientific notation:
10^-6.5 = 10^-6 × 10^-0.5 = 10^-6 × (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 10^-6 × 0.3162 ≈ 3.162×10^-7

Therefore, x = 2 × 3.162×10^-7 ≈ 6.32×10^-7 M

The concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately 6.32×10^-7 M.

# OpenAI completion

Alright, I need to determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is optimal, and the temperature is set at 25°C. The stability constant for the Ca-EDTA complex (KCa-EDTA) is provided as 5x10^10. Let me work through this.

Firstly, I recall that EDTA is a chelating agent which forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. A stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex implies that EDTA and calcium are in a 1:1 molar ratio. Because the solution has a concentration of 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA, this reflects the concentration of the complex. The mention of ideal pH likely means EDTA is fully available to bind calcium, so we can ignore any issues related to EDTA's protonation states. This simplifies the situation because the given stability constant applies under these ideal conditions.

The stability constant K represents the equilibrium constant for complex formation, described by the reaction:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ ⇌ Ca-EDTA²⁻

The stability constant K is expressed by:

K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

In a stoichiometric solution, the initial concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ forming the complex should be equal. Once the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ remain equal due to their 1:1 dissociation ratio. However, given the large K value (5x10^10), the complex is very stable, meaning that dissociation is minimal. This indicates that the concentrations of free Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are very low.

Let's define some variables. Assume the concentration of free Ca²⁺ is x. Then, the concentration of free EDTA⁴⁻ is also x, as they dissociate in equal amounts. Therefore, the complex concentration is 0.02 - x. Since K is large, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. This simplifies the calculation.

Substitute into the stability constant equation:

K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

Given K as 5x10^10, we have:

5x10^10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = (2x10^-2) / (5x10^10) = (2/5) x 10^-12 = 0.4 x 10^-12 = 4x10^-13

Then, x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. Clarifying, sqrt(4x10^-13) is sqrt(4) x sqrt(10^-13) = 2 x 10^-6.5. However, since 10^-6.5 equals 10^(-6) x 10^(-0.5) = 10^-6 x (1/sqrt(10)) ≈ 10^-6 x 0.3162 ≈ 3.162x10^-7. Doubling this value gives approximately 6.324x10^-7 M. Consequently, x ≈ 6.32x10^-7 M, representing the calcium ion concentration.

I’ll double-check this calculation. 

x² = 4x10^-13

Thus, x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. Verifying: 10^-6.5 equals 10^(-6 - 0.5) = 10^-6 / 10^0.5. Since 10^0.5 equals approximately 3.1623, 10^-6.5 is approximately 3.1623x10^-7. Hence, multiplying by 2 provides approximately 6.3245x10^-7. So, x ≈ 6.32x10^-7 M.

For precision, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, expressed as 2x10^(-13/2) = 2x10^-6.5. Typically, we aim for scientific notation with an integer exponent. Given 10^-6.5 ≈ 10^-6 * 0.31623, multiplying 2 by 0.31623 results in approximately 0.6324.

So yes, 6.32x10^-7 M.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a miscalculation here. Let me verify:\n\nGiven K = 5x10^10, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. The dissociation of Ca-EDTA is:\n\nCa-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe equilibrium concentrations would be:\n\n[Ca²⁺] = x\n\n[EDTA⁴⁻] = x\n\n[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02\n\nSo K (which is the formation constant) is given as 5x10^10. Wait, but the formation constant is for the reaction:\n\nCa²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ → Ca-EDTA²⁻\n\nSo Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])\n\nBut if we\'re looking at the reverse reaction (dissociation), the Kd (dissociation constant) would be 1/Kf.\n\nSo if the problem gives K as 5x10^10, which is the formation constant. Therefore, the expression is correct as written.\n\nTherefore, solving for x:\n\nx² = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / Kf ≈ 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13\n\nx = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5 = 6.32x10^-7 M\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s another approach. Since the complex is very stable, the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is valid. Let\'s confirm:\n\nIf x ≈ 6.32x10^-7, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.019999368, which is essentially 0.02. So the approximation holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6.3x10^-7 M. But let me check the exact value:\n\nx = sqrt(0.02 / (5x10^10)) = sqrt(2x10^-2 / 5x10^10) = sqrt(0.4x10^-12) = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5\n\nExpressed as 2x10^-6.5 is correct, but maybe converting to standard scientific notation:\n\n10^-6.5 = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1x10^-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162x10^-7\n\nSo 2 * 3.162x10^-7 ≈ 6.324x10^-7, which rounds to 6.32x10^-7 M. Depending on significant figures, since the given K is 5x10^10 (one significant figure) and the concentration is 0.02 M (two significant figures), the answer should probably have one significant figure, so 6x10^-7 M. Wait, but 0.02 has two significant figures, and K has one. When multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise number. So in the calculation x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13, the 0.02 has two sig figs and 5x10^10 has one, so the result should have one sig fig. Therefore, x² = 4x10^-13 (but 4 is one sig fig here? Wait, 0.02 is two, 5 is one. 0.02 / 5 = 0.004, which is 4x10^-3, but here it\'s 0.02 / 5x10^10 = 4x10^-13. So the numerator is 0.02 (two sig figs), denominator 5x10^10 (one sig fig). So the result is 4x10^-13 (one sig fig). Then taking the square root would give 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but with one sig fig, that would be 6x10^-7 M. However, sometimes when the first digit is a 1, sometimes an extra sig fig is given, but in this case, 4x10^-13 is one sig fig (the 4 is a single digit), so the square root would also be one sig fig. Therefore, the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. But maybe the problem expects more precision. Wait, the given concentration is 0.02 M, which is two sig figs, and K is 5x10^10, which is one. So the answer should have one significant figure. Hmm, but in some contexts, if the 0.02 is considered precise (e.g., 0.02 meaning 0.020), then two sig figs. But since it\'s written as 0.02, that\'s two sig figs. However, when dividing by 5x10^10 (one sig fig), the result should be one sig fig. So the answer is 6x10^-7 M. But I need to check the exact calculation again.\n\nWait, 0.02 divided by 5 is 0.004, which is 4x10^-3. Then divided by 10^10 gives 4x10^-13. So 4x10^-13 is one significant figure. Then square root of that is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but with one sig fig, it\'s 6x10^-7. However, 4 is one sig fig, so sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but 2 is exact here (from sqrt(4)), so maybe we can consider two sig figs? Wait, the 4 in 4x10^-13 comes from 0.02/5, which is 0.004, which is 4x10^-3. But 0.02 has two sig figs, 5 is one. So 0.02 / 5 = 0.004, which is one sig fig. Therefore, 4x10^-13 is one sig fig, so the square root is one sig fig. Therefore, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. But I\'ve seen different approaches where if you have, say, 0.02 (two sig figs) divided by 5x10^10 (one sig fig), the result is 4x10^-13 (one sig fig). Then sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but since 4x10^-13 is one sig fig, the answer should be 6x10^-7. However, if we keep more digits during calculation, we might write 6.3x10^-7, but strictly following sig figs, it\'s one. But maybe the question expects two sig figs because the concentration is given as 0.02, which is two. Hmm. Let me check the rules again. When multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least precise value. Here, 0.02 is two sig figs, 5x10^10 is one. So the result of 0.02 / 5x10^10 is 4x10^-13 (one sig fig). Then sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but since the input to the square root has one sig fig, the result should have one. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. However, in practice, sometimes people might give two sig figs here because the initial concentration has two. But I need to see what\'s expected here. The problem says "0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex" and "KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10". So 0.02 has two, K has one. The answer should have one. So 6x10^-7 M. But maybe the answer is expected to be in two sig figs. Wait, sometimes when the first number in the result is between 1 and 3, people might keep an extra digit. For example, 6.3 is two sig figs. But given that the K is one sig fig, I think the answer should be one. Alternatively, if the question allows, maybe two. Hmm. Let me check an example. Suppose you have 0.02 / 5x10^10 = 4x10^-13, sqrt of that is 6.3x10^-7. If 0.02 is two sig figs, and K is one, then the answer is one sig fig. So 6x10^-7. But maybe the answer is written as 6.3x10^-7, recognizing that 0.02 is two sig figs, but the K is one. It\'s a bit ambiguous. However, given that 5x10^10 is one sig fig, I think the answer should be one sig fig. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the exact value without considering sig figs. Let me recalculate the exact value:\n\nx = sqrt(0.02 / (5x10^10)) = sqrt(2x10^-2 / 5x10^10) = sqrt((2/5)x10^-12) = sqrt(0.4x10^-12) = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5 ≈ 6.3246x10^-7 M\n\nSo approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. If we round to two sig figs, that\'s 6.3x10^-7. If to one, 6x10^-7. But since 0.02 has two and K has one, the stricter approach is one sig fig. However, in many textbooks and problems, when one value has two sig figs and the other has one, sometimes the answer is given with two, but technically, it should be one. I think in this case, since K is given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), and the concentration is 0.02 (two), the answer should have one sig fig. So 6x10^-7 M. But I\'m a bit conflicted here. Maybe the question expects the answer in two sig figs. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is expected to be expressed as 6.3x10^-7, given that 0.02 is two sig figs, and K is one, but when you take the square root, the number of sig figs can sometimes increase. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again. If we have x² = 4x10^-13 (one sig fig), then x is sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. The 4 here is one sig fig, so the sqrt(4) is 2 (exact), but 10^-13 is exact? Wait, no. The 4x10^-13 is a measurement with one sig fig, so the sqrt would have one sig fig. Therefore, x = 6x10^-7 (one sig fig). Alternatively, if we consider that the 4 in 4x10^-13 is one sig fig, then sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but since 4 is one sig fig, 6.3 is two, which is inconsistent. Wait, perhaps the rule is that when you take the square root of a number with n sig figs, the result has n+1 sig figs. But I don\'t think that\'s a standard rule. Typically, the number of sig figs in the result should match the number in the original. For example, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 6.3x10^-7, but 4x10^-13 has one sig fig, so the result should have one. Therefore, 6x10^-7. However, in practice, when you have a number like 4x10^-13, which is one sig fig, and take the square root, you get a number where the first digit is 6, and the next is 3, but since the original had one sig fig, you should round to 6x10^-7. But I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe it\'s better to present the answer as 6.3x10^-7 M, acknowledging that it\'s approximate and the possible sig fig considerations. However, given the problem\'s context, I think they might expect the exact calculation result, which is around 6.3x10^-7, so I\'ll go with that. But let me check with another approach. Let\'s write the exact expression without approximation. The dissociation is:\n\nCa-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nInitial concentration: 0.02 M, 0, 0\n\nChange: -x, +x, +x\n\nEquilibrium: 0.02 - x, x, x\n\nThe stability constant Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = (0.02 - x)/(x²) = 5x10^10\n\nAssuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so:\n\n0.02 / x² = 5x10^10 → x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13 → x = 2x10^-6.5 ≈ 6.3246x10^-7 M\n\nIf we don\'t make the approximation, we can solve the quadratic equation:\n\n(0.02 - x) = 5x10^10 * x²\n\nSo 5x10^10 x² + x - 0.02 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in x: ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 5x10^10, b = 1, c = -0.02\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)\n\nPlugging in:\n\nx = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*5x10^10*0.02)]/(2*5x10^10)\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\nsqrt(1 + 4*5x10^10*0.02) = sqrt(1 + 4*0.1x10^10) = sqrt(1 + 4x10^9)\n\nBut 4x10^9 is much larger than 1, so sqrt(4x10^9) = 2x10^4.5 = 2x10^4 * sqrt(10) ≈ 2x10^4 * 3.1623 ≈ 6.3246x10^4\n\nTherefore, x ≈ [-1 + 6.3246x10^4]/(2*5x10^10)\n\nThe -1 is negligible compared to 6.3246x10^4, so:\n\nx ≈ (6.3246x10^4)/(1x10^11) = 6.3246x10^-7 M\n\nWhich matches the previous result. So even solving the quadratic without approximation gives the same result, confirming that x ≈ 6.3246x10^-7 M. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. Considering significant figures again, since K was given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig) and 0.02 M (two sig figs), the stricter answer would be 6x10^-7 M, but given that the quadratic solution gives 6.32x10^-7, which is precise, maybe the answer is expected to be in two sig figs, so 6.3x10^-7 M. Alternatively, the problem might accept either. However, since the user hasn\'t specified sig figs, but provided data with two (0.02) and one (5x10^10), it\'s safer to go with one sig fig. But given that the exact calculation yields approximately 6.3x10^-7, and in many cases, such problems expect the answer in two sig figs when possible, I think the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. But let me check some references. For example, in similar problems, when you have a large K, the assumption that x is negligible is valid, and the answer is calculated as sqrt(C/K), where C is the concentration of the complex. Here, C is 0.02, K is 5x10^10, so x = sqrt(0.02/(5x10^10)) = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5 = 6.32x10^-7. So the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. Therefore, I think the correct answer is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M, which can be written as 6.3e-7 M. However, if we consider significant figures strictly, it\'s 6x10^-7. But given that 0.02 has two, maybe it\'s 6.3x10^-7. The problem says "we assume that the pH is ideal", which probably means that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so the calculation is straightforward. Therefore, I will go with 6.3x10^-7 M, but I\'m a bit uncertain about the significant figures. Alternatively, expressing it as 6.3x10^-7 M with two sig figs is acceptable since 0.02 has two, and K has one, but when taking the square root, maybe we keep two. Hmm. Alternatively, the answer could be presented as 6.3x10^-7 M, acknowledging both significant figures from 0.02 and the approximation in K.

# cutoff_deepseek_completion response

The concentration of calcium ions in the solution can be calculated using the stability constant (K) of the Ca-EDTA complex. Given that the complex dissociates as:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The stability constant is expressed as:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) be the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\). Since \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) dissociate in a 1:1 ratio, their concentrations are both \( x \). The concentration of the complex is approximately \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \) M due to the large \( K \).

Substituting into the stability constant equation:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Considering significant figures (0.02 has two, \( K \) has one), the result is approximately:

\[
\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}}
\]

, so 0.6324x10^-6, which is 6.324x10^-7. So yes, 6.32x10^-7 M.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me verify:

Given K = 5x10^10, and [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. The dissociation of Ca-EDTA is:

Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

The equilibrium concentrations would be:

[Ca²⁺] = x

[EDTA⁴⁻] = x

[Ca-EDTA²⁻] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02

So K (which is the formation constant) is given as 5x10^10. Wait, but the formation constant is for the reaction:

Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻ → Ca-EDTA²⁻

So Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻])

But if we're looking at the reverse reaction (dissociation), the Kd (dissociation constant) would be 1/Kf.

So if the problem gives K as 5x10^10, which is the formation constant. Therefore, the expression is correct as written.

Therefore, solving for x:

x² = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / Kf ≈ 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13

x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5 = 6.32x10^-7 M

Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M.

But let me check if there's another approach. Since the complex is very stable, the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 is valid. Let's confirm:

If x ≈ 6.32x10^-7, then 0.02 - x ≈ 0.019999368, which is essentially 0.02. So the approximation holds.

Therefore, the answer should be 6.3x10^-7 M. But let me check the exact value:

x = sqrt(0.02 / (5x10^10)) = sqrt(2x10^-2 / 5x10^10) = sqrt(0.4x10^-12) = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5

Expressed as 2x10^-6.5 is correct, but maybe converting to standard scientific notation:

10^-6.5 = 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1x10^-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162x10^-7

So 2 * 3.162x10^-7 ≈ 6.324x10^-7, which rounds to 6.32x10^-7 M. Depending on significant figures, since the given K is 5x10^10 (one significant figure) and the concentration is 0.02 M (two significant figures), the answer should probably have one significant figure, so 6x10^-7 M. Wait, but 0.02 has two significant figures, and K has one. When multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise number. So in the calculation x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13, the 0.02 has two sig figs and 5x10^10 has one, so the result should have one sig fig. Therefore, x² = 4x10^-13 (but 4 is one sig fig here? Wait, 0.02 is two, 5 is one. 0.02 / 5 = 0.004, which is 4x10^-3, but here it's 0.02 / 5x10^10 = 4x10^-13. So the numerator is 0.02 (two sig figs), denominator 5x10^10 (one sig fig). So the result is 4x10^-13 (one sig fig). Then taking the square root would give 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but with one sig fig, that would be 6x10^-7 M. However, sometimes when the first digit is a 1, sometimes an extra sig fig is given, but in this case, 4x10^-13 is one sig fig (the 4 is a single digit), so the square root would also be one sig fig. Therefore, the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. But maybe the problem expects more precision. Wait, the given concentration is 0.02 M, which is two sig figs, and K is 5x10^10, which is one. So the answer should have one significant figure. Hmm, but in some contexts, if the 0.02 is considered precise (e.g., 0.02 meaning 0.020), then two sig figs. But since it's written as 0.02, that's two sig figs. However, when dividing by 5x10^10 (one sig fig), the result should be one sig fig. So the answer is 6x10^-7 M. But I need to check the exact calculation again.

Wait, 0.02 divided by 5 is 0.004, which is 4x10^-3. Then divided by 10^10 gives 4x10^-13. So 4x10^-13 is one significant figure. Then square root of that is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but with one sig fig, it's 6x10^-7. However, 4 is one sig fig, so sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but 2 is exact here (from sqrt(4)), so maybe we can consider two sig figs? Wait, the 4 in 4x10^-13 comes from 0.02/5, which is 0.004, which is 4x10^-3. But 0.02 has two sig figs, 5 is one. So 0.02 / 5 = 0.004, which is one sig fig. Therefore, 4x10^-13 is one sig fig, so the square root is one sig fig. Therefore, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. But I've seen different approaches where if you have, say, 0.02 (two sig figs) divided by 5x10^10 (one sig fig), the result is 4x10^-13 (one sig fig). Then sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but since 4x10^-13 is one sig fig, the answer should be 6x10^-7. However, if we keep more digits during calculation, we might write 6.3x10^-7, but strictly following sig figs, it's one. But maybe the question expects two sig figs because the concentration is given as 0.02, which is two. Hmm. Let me check the rules again. When multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least precise value. Here, 0.02 is two sig figs, 5x10^10 is one. So the result of 0.02 / 5x10^10 is 4x10^-13 (one sig fig). Then sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but since the input to the square root has one sig fig, the result should have one. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. However, in practice, sometimes people might give two sig figs here because the initial concentration has two. But I need to see what's expected here. The problem says "0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex" and "KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10". So 0.02 has two, K has one. The answer should have one. So 6x10^-7 M. But maybe the answer is expected to be in two sig figs. Wait, sometimes when the first number in the result is between 1 and 3, people might keep an extra digit. For example, 6.3 is two sig figs. But given that the K is one sig fig, I think the answer should be one. Alternatively, if the question allows, maybe two. Hmm. Let me check an example. Suppose you have 0.02 / 5x10^10 = 4x10^-13, sqrt of that is 6.3x10^-7. If 0.02 is two sig figs, and K is one, then the answer is one sig fig. So 6x10^-7. But maybe the answer is written as 6.3x10^-7, recognizing that 0.02 is two sig figs, but the K is one. It's a bit ambiguous. However, given that 5x10^10 is one sig fig, I think the answer should be one sig fig. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the exact value without considering sig figs. Let me recalculate the exact value:

x = sqrt(0.02 / (5x10^10)) = sqrt(2x10^-2 / 5x10^10) = sqrt((2/5)x10^-12) = sqrt(0.4x10^-12) = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5 ≈ 6.3246x10^-7 M

So approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. If we round to two sig figs, that's 6.3x10^-7. If to one, 6x10^-7. But since 0.02 has two and K has one, the stricter approach is one sig fig. However, in many textbooks and problems, when one value has two sig figs and the other has one, sometimes the answer is given with two, but technically, it should be one. I think in this case, since K is given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig), and the concentration is 0.02 (two), the answer should have one sig fig. So 6x10^-7 M. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the question expects the answer in two sig figs. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is expected to be expressed as 6.3x10^-7, given that 0.02 is two sig figs, and K is one, but when you take the square root, the number of sig figs can sometimes increase. Hmm, not sure. Let me think again. If we have x² = 4x10^-13 (one sig fig), then x is sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5. The 4 here is one sig fig, so the sqrt(4) is 2 (exact), but 10^-13 is exact? Wait, no. The 4x10^-13 is a measurement with one sig fig, so the sqrt would have one sig fig. Therefore, x = 6x10^-7 (one sig fig). Alternatively, if we consider that the 4 in 4x10^-13 is one sig fig, then sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but since 4 is one sig fig, 6.3 is two, which is inconsistent. Wait, perhaps the rule is that when you take the square root of a number with n sig figs, the result has n+1 sig figs. But I don't think that's a standard rule. Typically, the number of sig figs in the result should match the number in the original. For example, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 6.3x10^-7, but 4x10^-13 has one sig fig, so the result should have one. Therefore, 6x10^-7. However, in practice, when you have a number like 4x10^-13, which is one sig fig, and take the square root, you get a number where the first digit is 6, and the next is 3, but since the original had one sig fig, you should round to 6x10^-7. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to present the answer as 6.3x10^-7 M, acknowledging that it's approximate and the possible sig fig considerations. However, given the problem's context, I think they might expect the exact calculation result, which is around 6.3x10^-7, so I'll go with that. But let me check with another approach. Let's write the exact expression without approximation. The dissociation is:

Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

Initial concentration: 0.02 M, 0, 0

Change: -x, +x, +x

Equilibrium: 0.02 - x, x, x

The stability constant Kf = [Ca-EDTA²⁻]/([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = (0.02 - x)/(x²) = 5x10^10

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02, so:

0.02 / x² = 5x10^10 → x² = 0.02 / (5x10^10) = 4x10^-13 → x = 2x10^-6.5 ≈ 6.3246x10^-7 M

If we don't make the approximation, we can solve the quadratic equation:

(0.02 - x) = 5x10^10 * x²

So 5x10^10 x² + x - 0.02 = 0

This is a quadratic in x: ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 5x10^10, b = 1, c = -0.02

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a)

Plugging in:

x = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*5x10^10*0.02)]/(2*5x10^10)

Calculate discriminant:

sqrt(1 + 4*5x10^10*0.02) = sqrt(1 + 4*0.1x10^10) = sqrt(1 + 4x10^9)

But 4x10^9 is much larger than 1, so sqrt(4x10^9) = 2x10^4.5 = 2x10^4 * sqrt(10) ≈ 2x10^4 * 3.1623 ≈ 6.3246x10^4

Therefore, x ≈ [-1 + 6.3246x10^4]/(2*5x10^10)

The -1 is negligible compared to 6.3246x10^4, so:

x ≈ (6.3246x10^4)/(1x10^11) = 6.3246x10^-7 M

Which matches the previous result. So even solving the quadratic without approximation gives the same result, confirming that x ≈ 6.3246x10^-7 M. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. Considering significant figures again, since K was given as 5x10^10 (one sig fig) and 0.02 M (two sig figs), the stricter answer would be 6x10^-7 M, but given that the quadratic solution gives 6.32x10^-7, which is precise, maybe the answer is expected to be in two sig figs, so 6.3x10^-7 M. Alternatively, the problem might accept either. However, since the user hasn't specified sig figs, but provided data with two (0.02) and one (5x10^10), it's safer to go with one sig fig. But given that the exact calculation yields approximately 6.3x10^-7, and in many cases, such problems expect the answer in two sig figs when possible, I think the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. But let me check some references. For example, in similar problems, when you have a large K, the assumption that x is negligible is valid, and the answer is calculated as sqrt(C/K), where C is the concentration of the complex. Here, C is 0.02, K is 5x10^10, so x = sqrt(0.02/(5x10^10)) = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5 = 6.32x10^-7. So the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. Therefore, I think the correct answer is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M, which can be written as 6.3e-7 M. However, if we consider significant figures strictly, it's 6x10^-7. But given that 0.02 has two, maybe it's 6.3x10^-7. The problem says "we assume that the pH is ideal", which probably means that EDTA is fully deprotonated, so the calculation is straightforward. Therefore, I will go with 6.3x10^-7 M, but I'm a bit uncertain about the significant figures. Alternatively, expressing it as 6.3x10^-7 M with two sig figs is acceptable since 0.02 has two, and K has one, but when taking the square root, maybe we keep two. Hmm. Alternatively, the answer could be presented as 6.3x10^-7 M, acknowledging both significant figures from 0.02 and the approximation in K. In conclusion, I think the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA solution at pH 7 and 25°C with \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \):

1. **Reaction and Stability Constant**:
   \[
   \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}, \quad K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
   \]

2. **Assumptions**:
   - At ideal pH, EDTA is fully deprotonated (\(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\)).
   - The dissociation of Ca-EDTA is minimal due to the large \( K \).

3. **Let \( x = [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] \)**. Then:
   \[
   K = \frac{0.02}{x^2} \implies 5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13} \implies x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
   \]

**Final Answer**:  
The concentration of calcium ions is \(\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}}\).

Rounded to two significant figures, this would be 6.3x10^-7 M, but perhaps the problem expects more precise handling.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s use exact calculation. Let me compute 0.02/(5x10^10) first.\n\n0.02 is 2x10^-2. So, 2x10^-2 divided by 5x10^10 equals (2/5)x10^(-2-10) = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13. Then, the square root of 4x10^-13 is 2x10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is the same as 1/(10^6.5). Since 10^0.5 is sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623, 10^6.5 = 10^6 * 3.1623 ≈ 3.1623x10^6. Therefore, 1/(3.1623x10^6) ≈ 3.1623x10^-7. Multiplying by 2 gives 6.3246x10^-7. So, approximately 6.32x10^-7 M.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. However, considering significant figures, the given K is 5x10^10 (one significant figure) and the concentration is 0.02 M (two significant figures). The stability constant is given with one significant figure, which might suggest that the answer should also be expressed with one significant figure. But since 0.02 is two, perhaps two. But K is 5x10^10 which is one. Maybe the answer should have one significant figure. So, 6x10^-7 M. But the exact calculation is about 6.32x10^-7. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 6.3x10^-7 if two significant figures. However, in some contexts, the number of significant figures is determined by the value with the least, which here K is 1 sig fig. But 0.02 is two. However, when multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement. Here, K is 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), and concentration is 0.02 (2 sig figs). So, the calculation is 0.02/(5x10^10) = 4x10^-13 (1 sig fig because of K). Then sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but since K is one sig fig, the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. However, some sources might consider the 0.02 M as two sig figs, leading to two sig figs in the answer. But given that K is only one sig fig, maybe we keep one. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects two, given that 0.02 has two. This is a bit ambiguous, but in many cases, constants are considered exact, or their significant figures are not counted against the answer. However, in real practice, K is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), so the answer should be 6x10^-7. But let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula for the concentration of metal ions in a 1:1 complex. Since the complex dissociates as:\n\nCa-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻\n\nThe dissociation constant K_d is 1/K = 1/(5x10^10) = 2x10^-11.\n\nThe concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Then, K_d = x² / (0.02 - x). Since K_d is very small, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Therefore:\n\nx² = K_d * 0.02 = (2x10^-11)(0.02) = 4x10^-13\n\nThen x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5 ≈ 6.32x10^-7 M. So, same result. Hence, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.\n\nBut again, considering significant figures. If K is 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), then K_d is 2x10^-11 (1 sig fig). Then, x² = (2x10^-11)(0.02) = 4x10^-13, which is 4x10^-13 (one sig fig). Therefore, x = sqrt(4x10^-13) ≈ 6x10^-7 (1 sig fig). So, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. However, if 0.02 is considered to have two sig figs, then 0.02 is two, and K is one. Then, in the multiplication, the result should have one sig fig. So, 0.02 * 2x10^-11 = 4x10^-13 (one sig fig). So, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 6x10^-7 (one sig fig). Hence, the answer is 6x10^-7 M.\n\nBut in some educational settings, they might expect more precise answers, perhaps using two sig figs. However, given that K is 5x10^10 (one sig fig), and 0.02 is two, but K is part of the calculation, the answer should have one. However, in practice, when you have a mix of significant figures, you go with the smallest number. So, 5x10^10 is one, 0.02 is two. The answer should have one. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. But I think the problem might accept 6.3x10^-7 as well, given that in textbooks, sometimes constants are taken as exact. However, given the problem statement, since K is given as 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, and the concentration 0.02 is two, but K is a constant, which is known to maybe more precision. But the problem gives K as 5x10^10, so perhaps we have to take it as one. Hence, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the answer in terms of exact calculation. Let\'s compute it precisely.\n\nGiven:\n\nK = 5x10^10 = 5.0x10^10\n\nConcentration of Ca-EDTA = 0.02 M\n\nAssuming x is [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻]\n\nSo,\n\nK = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02 / x²\n\nThus,\n\nx² = 0.02 / (5.0x10^10) = 0.004x10^-10 = 4.0x10^-13\n\nThen,\n\nx = sqrt(4.0x10^-13) = 2.0x10^-6.5\n\nBut 10^-6.5 is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 1.0x10^-6 / sqrt(10) ≈ 1.0x10^-6 / 3.16227766 ≈ 3.16227766x10^-7\n\nMultiply by 2.0:\n\nx ≈ 2.0 * 3.16227766x10^-7 ≈ 6.32455532x10^-7 M\n\nSo, approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. If we need to consider significant figures, since K is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) and 0.02 (2 sig figs), the answer should be limited by the least number of sig figs, which is 1. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. However, in some contexts, the concentration of 0.02 M (which is two sig figs) and K as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) would lead to the answer having one sig fig. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects an exact answer without worrying about sig figs. In that case, 6.3x10^-7 M or 6.32x10^-7 M. Let me check an example from a textbook. For example, in such EDTA problems, sometimes the answer is expressed with two sig figs if the concentration is given with two, even if K has one. Maybe the problem expects two sig figs here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2x10^-7 M. Wait, that would be if I miscalculated. Wait, wait. Let me check again.\n\nWait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is 3.16x10^-7, so 2x3.16x10^-7 = 6.32x10^-7. So that\'s correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. If we write 6.3x10^-7, that\'s two sig figs. But since K is one sig fig, perhaps it\'s better to write 6x10^-7. However, in many textbooks, when K is given as 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, but the concentration is given as 0.02 M (two), they might present the answer with two sig figs. Let me check with the standard formula.\n\nIn general, when you have a dissociation:\n\nK = [Complex]/([Ca][EDTA])\n\nAssuming [Ca] = [EDTA] = x, and [Complex] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.\n\nThen x = sqrt([Complex]/K). So, x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7. So, 6.3x10^-7 M.\n\nTherefore, given that the problem includes 0.02 (two sig figs) and K as 5e10 (one sig fig), if we consider the 0.02 as the limiting factor, then two sig figs. But K is a stability constant, which is often known to more decimal places, but in this problem, it\'s given as 5e10, so one. However, in many cases, when constants are given with few sig figs but concentrations with more, people might still use the concentration\'s sig figs. But I think the strict rule is that the number of sig figs in the result is determined by the least precise measurement. Since K is 5e10 (1 sig fig), and the concentration is 0.02 (2 sig figs), the answer should have 1 sig fig. Therefore, 6e-7 M.\n\nBut perhaps, in this problem, since the answer is expected in boxed notation, maybe they want the precise value regardless of sig figs, so 6.3x10^-7 or 6.32x10^-7. Let me check with exact calculation.\n\nWait, 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.02 / 5 / 1e10 = 0.004 / 1e10 = 4e-3 / 1e10 = 4e-13. Then sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. As 10^-6.5 is 3.16227766e-7, so 2 * 3.16227766e-7 = 6.3245553e-7. So, approximately 6.325e-7. Rounded to three sig figs, 6.32e-7. However, since K is one sig fig and 0.02 is two, the answer is tricky. If we take K as exact (e.g., 5.000...x10^10), then 0.02 is two sig figs, so the answer would be two. But since K is given as 5x10^10, which is one, maybe the answer should be one. But in practice, perhaps the answer is expected to be 6.3x10^-7 M. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn\'t care about sig figs and just wants the numerical value. Let\'s see. If it\'s an exam problem, maybe 6.3x10^-7 is acceptable, but to be safe, maybe 6x10^-7. But I think the precise value is 6.32x10^-7, so I will present that, and perhaps the answer expects that.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: since the complex is very stable, the concentration of free Ca²⁺ can be found by:\n\n[Ca²⁺] = sqrt([Ca-EDTA]/K)\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n[Ca²⁺] = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. Given the options, I think this is the correct answer, and the slight difference in sig figs is negligible here. So, I will go with 6.3x10^-7 M. However, the exact value is 6.3245553e-7, which rounds to 6.3e-7 with two sig figs or 6e-7 with one. But given that 0.02 has two sig figs, and K is one, maybe 6.3e-7 is okay. Alternatively, if the answer is to be written in scientific notation with one decimal place, 6.3e-7. But let me check if there\'s another way.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex", which might imply that all Ca²⁺ is bound to EDTA, but since there\'s always some dissociation, but with such a high K, it\'s negligible. Wait, but we were told to calculate the concentration, so even though it\'s small, we need to compute it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there\'s a misunderstanding. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, and at ideal pH (so EDTA is deprotonated), then the dissociation is minimal. The concentration of free Ca²⁺ would be sqrt([Ca-EDTA]/K), which we calculated as ~6.3e-7. Therefore, the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M.\n\nIn conclusion, after considering all factors, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. Depending on significant figures, it could be 6x10^-7 or 6.3x10^-7. Given that the problem provides K with one significant figure and concentration with two, but K\'s precision might be considered more critical here, the answer is likely 6x10^-7 M. However, in many contexts, the answer would be presented as 6.3x10^-7 M. To confirm, let\'s see:\n\nIf K is 5.0x10^10 (two sig figs), and concentration is 0.02 M (two sig figs), then the answer would be 6.3x10^-7 (two sig figs). But the problem states K as 5x10^10, which is one sig fig. Therefore, strictly, it\'s 6x10^-7. However, in practice, people might still use two. Given that, perhaps the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. I think in the absence of specific instructions on sig figs, providing the calculated value is acceptable.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe concentration of calcium ions is \\boxed{6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ M}}.\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1745385833, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=3920, prompt_tokens=1030, total_tokens=4950, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='Nebius')

To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the stability constant \( K \) for the Ca-EDTA complex, which is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The stability constant \( K \) is given by:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the solution is stoichiometric, the concentrations of free Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻ are equal, denoted as \( x \). The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and since \( K \) is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so we approximate the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. Substituting into the stability constant equation:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times \frac{10^{-6}}{\sqrt{10}} \approx 2 \times 3.162 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.324 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Considering significant figures, the stability constant \( K \) is given with one significant figure, and the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given with two significant figures. However, the result is typically presented with two significant figures due to the concentration value. Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is:

\[
\boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}
\]

Therefore, 6.324x10^-7 M. Rounded to two significant figures, this would be 6.3x10^-7 M, but perhaps the problem expects more precise handling.

Alternatively, let's use exact calculation. Let me compute 0.02/(5x10^10) first.

0.02 is 2x10^-2. So, 2x10^-2 divided by 5x10^10 equals (2/5)x10^(-2-10) = 0.4x10^-12 = 4x10^-13. Then, the square root of 4x10^-13 is 2x10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is the same as 1/(10^6.5). Since 10^0.5 is sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623, 10^6.5 = 10^6 * 3.1623 ≈ 3.1623x10^6. Therefore, 1/(3.1623x10^6) ≈ 3.1623x10^-7. Multiplying by 2 gives 6.3246x10^-7. So, approximately 6.32x10^-7 M.

Therefore, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. However, considering significant figures, the given K is 5x10^10 (one significant figure) and the concentration is 0.02 M (two significant figures). The stability constant is given with one significant figure, which might suggest that the answer should also be expressed with one significant figure. But since 0.02 is two, perhaps two. But K is 5x10^10 which is one. Maybe the answer should have one significant figure. So, 6x10^-7 M. But the exact calculation is about 6.32x10^-7. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 6.3x10^-7 if two significant figures. However, in some contexts, the number of significant figures is determined by the value with the least, which here K is 1 sig fig. But 0.02 is two. However, when multiplying or dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement. Here, K is 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), and concentration is 0.02 (2 sig figs). So, the calculation is 0.02/(5x10^10) = 4x10^-13 (1 sig fig because of K). Then sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5, which is 6.3x10^-7, but since K is one sig fig, the answer should be 6x10^-7 M. However, some sources might consider the 0.02 M as two sig figs, leading to two sig figs in the answer. But given that K is only one sig fig, maybe we keep one. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects two, given that 0.02 has two. This is a bit ambiguous, but in many cases, constants are considered exact, or their significant figures are not counted against the answer. However, in real practice, K is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), so the answer should be 6x10^-7. But let me check another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula for the concentration of metal ions in a 1:1 complex. Since the complex dissociates as:

Ca-EDTA²⁻ ⇌ Ca²⁺ + EDTA⁴⁻

The dissociation constant K_d is 1/K = 1/(5x10^10) = 2x10^-11.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca²⁺ and EDTA⁴⁻. Then, K_d = x² / (0.02 - x). Since K_d is very small, x is negligible compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Therefore:

x² = K_d * 0.02 = (2x10^-11)(0.02) = 4x10^-13

Then x = sqrt(4x10^-13) = 2x10^-6.5 ≈ 6.32x10^-7 M. So, same result. Hence, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M.

But again, considering significant figures. If K is 5x10^10 (1 sig fig), then K_d is 2x10^-11 (1 sig fig). Then, x² = (2x10^-11)(0.02) = 4x10^-13, which is 4x10^-13 (one sig fig). Therefore, x = sqrt(4x10^-13) ≈ 6x10^-7 (1 sig fig). So, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. However, if 0.02 is considered to have two sig figs, then 0.02 is two, and K is one. Then, in the multiplication, the result should have one sig fig. So, 0.02 * 2x10^-11 = 4x10^-13 (one sig fig). So, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 6x10^-7 (one sig fig). Hence, the answer is 6x10^-7 M.

But in some educational settings, they might expect more precise answers, perhaps using two sig figs. However, given that K is 5x10^10 (one sig fig), and 0.02 is two, but K is part of the calculation, the answer should have one. However, in practice, when you have a mix of significant figures, you go with the smallest number. So, 5x10^10 is one, 0.02 is two. The answer should have one. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. But I think the problem might accept 6.3x10^-7 as well, given that in textbooks, sometimes constants are taken as exact. However, given the problem statement, since K is given as 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, and the concentration 0.02 is two, but K is a constant, which is known to maybe more precision. But the problem gives K as 5x10^10, so perhaps we have to take it as one. Hence, the answer is 6x10^-7 M. But I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the answer in terms of exact calculation. Let's compute it precisely.

Given:

K = 5x10^10 = 5.0x10^10

Concentration of Ca-EDTA = 0.02 M

Assuming x is [Ca²⁺] = [EDTA⁴⁻]

So,

K = [Ca-EDTA²⁻] / ([Ca²⁺][EDTA⁴⁻]) = 0.02 / x²

Thus,

x² = 0.02 / (5.0x10^10) = 0.004x10^-10 = 4.0x10^-13

Then,

x = sqrt(4.0x10^-13) = 2.0x10^-6.5

But 10^-6.5 is 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 1.0x10^-6 / sqrt(10) ≈ 1.0x10^-6 / 3.16227766 ≈ 3.16227766x10^-7

Multiply by 2.0:

x ≈ 2.0 * 3.16227766x10^-7 ≈ 6.32455532x10^-7 M

So, approximately 6.32x10^-7 M. If we need to consider significant figures, since K is given as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) and 0.02 (2 sig figs), the answer should be limited by the least number of sig figs, which is 1. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M. However, in some contexts, the concentration of 0.02 M (which is two sig figs) and K as 5x10^10 (1 sig fig) would lead to the answer having one sig fig. Therefore, 6x10^-7 M.

But maybe the problem expects an exact answer without worrying about sig figs. In that case, 6.3x10^-7 M or 6.32x10^-7 M. Let me check an example from a textbook. For example, in such EDTA problems, sometimes the answer is expressed with two sig figs if the concentration is given with two, even if K has one. Maybe the problem expects two sig figs here. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 2x10^-7 M. Wait, that would be if I miscalculated. Wait, wait. Let me check again.

Wait, sqrt(4x10^-13) is 2x10^-6.5. But 10^-6.5 is 3.16x10^-7, so 2x3.16x10^-7 = 6.32x10^-7. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. If we write 6.3x10^-7, that's two sig figs. But since K is one sig fig, perhaps it's better to write 6x10^-7. However, in many textbooks, when K is given as 5x10^10, which is one sig fig, but the concentration is given as 0.02 M (two), they might present the answer with two sig figs. Let me check with the standard formula.

In general, when you have a dissociation:

K = [Complex]/([Ca][EDTA])

Assuming [Ca] = [EDTA] = x, and [Complex] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Then x = sqrt([Complex]/K). So, x = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.3e-7. So, 6.3x10^-7 M.

Therefore, given that the problem includes 0.02 (two sig figs) and K as 5e10 (one sig fig), if we consider the 0.02 as the limiting factor, then two sig figs. But K is a stability constant, which is often known to more decimal places, but in this problem, it's given as 5e10, so one. However, in many cases, when constants are given with few sig figs but concentrations with more, people might still use the concentration's sig figs. But I think the strict rule is that the number of sig figs in the result is determined by the least precise measurement. Since K is 5e10 (1 sig fig), and the concentration is 0.02 (2 sig figs), the answer should have 1 sig fig. Therefore, 6e-7 M.

But perhaps, in this problem, since the answer is expected in boxed notation, maybe they want the precise value regardless of sig figs, so 6.3x10^-7 or 6.32x10^-7. Let me check with exact calculation.

Wait, 0.02 / 5e10 = 0.02 / 5 / 1e10 = 0.004 / 1e10 = 4e-3 / 1e10 = 4e-13. Then sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. As 10^-6.5 is 3.16227766e-7, so 2 * 3.16227766e-7 = 6.3245553e-7. So, approximately 6.325e-7. Rounded to three sig figs, 6.32e-7. However, since K is one sig fig and 0.02 is two, the answer is tricky. If we take K as exact (e.g., 5.000...x10^10), then 0.02 is two sig figs, so the answer would be two. But since K is given as 5x10^10, which is one, maybe the answer should be one. But in practice, perhaps the answer is expected to be 6.3x10^-7 M. Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't care about sig figs and just wants the numerical value. Let's see. If it's an exam problem, maybe 6.3x10^-7 is acceptable, but to be safe, maybe 6x10^-7. But I think the precise value is 6.32x10^-7, so I will present that, and perhaps the answer expects that.

Alternatively, another approach: since the complex is very stable, the concentration of free Ca²⁺ can be found by:

[Ca²⁺] = sqrt([Ca-EDTA]/K)

So, plugging in:

[Ca²⁺] = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

Therefore, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. Given the options, I think this is the correct answer, and the slight difference in sig figs is negligible here. So, I will go with 6.3x10^-7 M. However, the exact value is 6.3245553e-7, which rounds to 6.3e-7 with two sig figs or 6e-7 with one. But given that 0.02 has two sig figs, and K is one, maybe 6.3e-7 is okay. Alternatively, if the answer is to be written in scientific notation with one decimal place, 6.3e-7. But let me check if there's another way.

Alternatively, since the problem says "stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex", which might imply that all Ca²⁺ is bound to EDTA, but since there's always some dissociation, but with such a high K, it's negligible. Wait, but we were told to calculate the concentration, so even though it's small, we need to compute it.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. If the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, and at ideal pH (so EDTA is deprotonated), then the dissociation is minimal. The concentration of free Ca²⁺ would be sqrt([Ca-EDTA]/K), which we calculated as ~6.3e-7. Therefore, the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M.

In conclusion, after considering all factors, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3x10^-7 M. Depending on significant figures, it could be 6x10^-7 or 6.3x10^-7. Given that the problem provides K with one significant figure and concentration with two, but K's precision might be considered more critical here, the answer is likely 6x10^-7 M. However, in many contexts, the answer would be presented as 6.3x10^-7 M. To confirm, let's see:

If K is 5.0x10^10 (two sig figs), and concentration is 0.02 M (two sig figs), then the answer would be 6.3x10^-7 (two sig figs). But the problem states K as 5x10^10, which is one sig fig. Therefore, strictly, it's 6x10^-7. However, in practice, people might still use two. Given that, perhaps the answer is 6.3x10^-7 M. I think in the absence of specific instructions on sig figs, providing the calculated value is acceptable.

**Final Answer**
The concentration of calcium ions is \boxed{6.3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ M}}.
