# Original Question

Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?

# DeepSeek response (via openrouter)

To determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \( D \). This gives the relationship \( D \propto P^{2/3} \). 

The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star, \( T \propto D^{-1/2} \). Combining these relationships, we find \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \).

Given the orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, Planet_2 has a period \( P_2 = 2 \) and Planet_4 has a period \( P_4 = 3.5 \). The temperature ratio \( T_4 / T_2 \) is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{3.5} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}
\]

Okay, let's try to figure out the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Hmm, so the problem states that there are five planets with orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They are in orbital resonance, have circular orbits, and the same albedo. We need to find the equilibrium temperature ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2.

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula, if I recall correctly, is derived from the balance between incoming stellar radiation and outgoing blackbody radiation. The basic formula is T = (L * (1 - a) / (16 * π * σ * D²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star. Since all planets have the same albedo, the (1 - a) term cancels out when taking the ratio. So the temperature ratio would depend on the inverse square root of the distance ratio, right? Because when you take the fourth root of (D²), it becomes D^(1/2), so inverse square root of D.

But wait, how do we relate the orbital period to the distance? Oh, right! Kepler's third law! For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ D³. Therefore, D ∝ P^(2/3). So if we can find the ratio of their orbital periods, we can find the ratio of their distances, and then use that to find the temperature ratio.

Given that the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. So Planet_2 has a period of 2 units, and Planet_4 has a period of 3.5 units. Wait, let's confirm: Planet_1:1, Planet_2:2, Planet_3:2.5, Planet_4:3.5, Planet_5:5. Yes.

So the periods P2 = 2 and P4 = 3.5. Then, using Kepler's third law, D2 ∝ P2^(2/3) and D4 ∝ P4^(2/3). So the distance ratio D4/D2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3). Then, since the equilibrium temperature T ∝ 1/D^(1/2), the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). Let me verify that.

Wait, let's step through it again. Starting from Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/GM) * D³. Since all planets are orbiting the same star, GM is a constant, so P² ∝ D³. Therefore, D ∝ P^(2/3). So if D4/D2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Then, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16πσ D²) ]^(1/4). Since L, a, π, σ are constants here, T ∝ D^(-1/2). Therefore, T4/T2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). So that's (2/3.5)^(1/3). Let's compute that.

But 3.5 is 7/2, so 2 divided by 7/2 is 4/7. So (4/7)^(1/3). The cube root of 4/7. Alternatively, 4 is 2², so 2²/7, so cube root is 2^(2/3)/7^(1/3). But maybe we can leave it as (4/7)^(1/3) or rationalize it differently? Wait, but the problem asks for the ratio in terms of integers? Hmm, maybe not. Let me check if I messed up somewhere.

Wait, the orbital periods are given as ratios. So P4 is 3.5, which is 7/2, and P2 is 2. So the ratio P2/P4 is 2/(7/2) = 4/7. Therefore, T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). So that's the cube root of 4/7. But maybe they want it expressed as a ratio of integers? But cube root of 4/7 is not a rational number. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the exponent.

Wait, let's check again.

Starting with T ∝ D^(-1/2). Since D ∝ P^(2/3), then T ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). Therefore, T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). So yes, that's (2/3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). So the ratio is the cube root of 4/7. Is there a way to write this more neatly? 4 is 2² and 7 is prime, so perhaps that's as simplified as it gets. Alternatively, if we rationalize the cube root, but since they ask for the ratio, maybe just present it as (4/7)^(1/3). Alternatively, they might need it expressed as exponents. But let me check if I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the inverse? Because sometimes equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, so if Planet_4 is farther away, it should be colder, so T4 < T2, so the ratio should be less than 1. Since 4/7 is less than 1, its cube root is also less than 1, so T4/T2 is (4/7)^(1/3). That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using the ratio in terms of planet's order. Wait, the planets are in orbital resonance. Wait, orbital resonance usually means their orbital periods are in ratios of small integers. Here, the periods are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, which are not integers. Hmm, 1:2:5/2:7/2:5. So maybe they are expressed in terms of fractions. But perhaps the resonances are more complex, like chains. For example, 1:2 could be a 1:2 resonance, 2:2.5 is 4:5, 2.5:3.5 is 5:7, 3.5:5 is 7:10. But maybe that's not necessary for the problem. The problem states they are in orbital resonance, but maybe that's just context, and the key is the period ratios given.

So given that, the calculation seems straightforward. So the answer is the cube root of (4/7), which can be written as (4/7)^(1/3). Alternatively, rationalizing the exponents, but I think that's the simplest form.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Maybe I confused Planet_4 and Planet_2. The problem asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4/T2. Since Planet_4 has a longer period (3.5 vs. 2), it is farther from the star. Therefore, its equilibrium temperature should be lower. So T4 is less than T2, so the ratio is less than 1, which matches our calculation of (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.7937. So that seems reasonable.

Alternatively, if the problem had asked for T2/T4, it would be (7/4)^(1/3), but it's specifically T4/T2.

Is there any chance that albedo or other factors might come into play? The problem states that all planets have the same albedo, so albedo doesn't affect the ratio. The formula T ∝ (L / D²)^(1/4), so with same albedo, it's just dependent on D. Since L is the same for all planets (same star), so yes, T ∝ D^(-1/2). Then D ∝ P^(2/3), so T ∝ P^(-1/3). So T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (3.5/2)^(-1/3) = (7/4)^(-1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). So that's correct.

Therefore, the ratio is the cube root of 4/7. Since the problem asks for the ratio in boxed notation, maybe we can write it as \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

Alternatively, sometimes people rationalize the denominator, but in this case, since it's a fractional exponent, I think writing it as (4/7)^{1/3} is acceptable. Alternatively, if they want it in terms of exponents with the same base, but 4 is 2², so (2²/7)^{1/3} = 2^{2/3}/7^{1/3}, but I don't think that's simpler. So the most straightforward is (4/7)^(1/3).

I think that's the answer. Let me check once again for calculation errors. Starting from Kepler's law: P² ∝ D³, so D ∝ P^(2/3). Then T ∝ 1/sqrt(D) ∝ P^(-1/3). Therefore, T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (3.5/2)^(-1/3) = (7/4)^(-1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). Yes, that's correct. So the final answer should be the cube root of 4/7, boxed as \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

Let's determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. According to the problem, there are five planets with orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. These planets have circular orbits, exist in orbital resonance, and share the same albedo. We need to calculate the equilibrium temperature ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2.

I recall that a planet's equilibrium temperature is related to its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The equilibrium temperature formula comes from balancing incoming stellar radiation with outgoing blackbody radiation: T = (L * (1 - a) / (16 * π * σ * D²))^(1/4), where L represents star luminosity, a is albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the star-planet distance. Since all planets have identical albedo, the (1 - a) term will cancel out when calculating the ratio. Therefore, the temperature ratio depends on the inverse square root of the distance ratio, as taking the fourth root of (D²) gives D^(1/2), resulting in an inverse square root relationship with D.

To connect orbital period with distance, we can use Kepler's third law, which states that for planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. This means P² ∝ D³, or equivalently, D ∝ P^(2/3). By finding the orbital period ratio, we can determine the distance ratio and subsequently calculate the temperature ratio.

The problem gives us the orbital period ratios as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planets 1 through 5. This means Planet_2 has a period of 2 units and Planet_4 has a period of 3.5 units. To verify: Planet_1:1, Planet_2:2, Planet_3:2.5, Planet_4:3.5, and Planet_5:5.

Let's attempt to determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The scenario outlines that there are five planets with orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. These planets are in orbital resonance, with circular orbits and identical albedo. Our task is to find the equilibrium temperature ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2.

I recall that a planet's equilibrium temperature depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The equation is based on the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing blackbody radiation. The fundamental formula is T = (L * (1 - a) / (16 * π * σ * D²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a represents the albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D signifies the distance from the star. Since all planets have the same albedo, the (1 - a) term cancels out when calculating the ratio. This means the temperature ratio will rely on the inverse square root of the distance ratio, because taking the fourth root of (D²) reduces to D^(1/2), hence the inverse square root of D.

But how do we connect the orbital period to the distance? Ah, that's it—Kepler's third law! For planets orbiting the same star, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, so P² ∝ D³, which implies D ∝ P^(2/3). By finding the ratio of their orbital periods, we can determine the ratio of their distances and then use this information to calculate the temperature ratio.

Given the provided period ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5, Planet_2 has a period of 2 units and Planet_4 has a period of 3.5 units. Let's verify: Planet_1:1, Planet_2:2, Planet_3:2.5, Planet_4:3.5, Planet_5:5.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting their orbital periods. The given orbital period ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. Thus, Planet_2 has a period of 2 units and Planet_4 has a period of 3.5 units.

Using Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star), we have:
\[ P^2 \propto D^3 \]
Thus, the distance \( D \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \).

The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is proportional to \( D^{-1/2} \). Combining these relationships, we get:
\[ T \propto P^{-1/3} \]

The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is therefore:
\[ \frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_4}{P_2} \right)^{-1/3} \]

Substituting the given periods \( P_4 = 3.5 \) and \( P_2 = 2 \):
\[ \frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{3.5}{2} \right)^{-1/3} = \left( \frac{7}{4} \right)^{-1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:
\[
\boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}
\]

# cutoff_deepseek_completion reasoning

Yes, that's the given ratio.

So first, let's write the ratio of the periods P4/P2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75. Then, since D ∝ P^(2/3), the distance ratio D4/D2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Then, since equilibrium temperature T ∝ D^(-1/2), the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (D4/D2)^(-1/2) = (1.75)^(-1/3).

Wait, let's check that again. If D is proportional to P^(2/3), then D4/D2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Then, since T is proportional to D^(-1/2), so T4/T2 = (D4/D2)^(-1/2) = [(P4/P2)^(2/3)]^(-1/2) = (P4/P2)^(-1/3). So that's (3.5/2)^(-1/3) = (1.75)^(-1/3). Which is the same as 1/(1.75)^(1/3).

But maybe we can express this ratio in fractional terms instead of decimal. 3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2 = (7/2)/2 = 7/4. So the ratio is (7/4)^(-1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). That's the cube root of 4/7. Alternatively, written as (4/7)^(1/3).

But the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, so T4/T2. So the answer is (4/7)^(1/3). Alternatively, 4^(1/3)/7^(1/3). Since they might want it in ratio terms, perhaps as a numerical ratio? But since 4 and 7 are both primes, we can't simplify the cube roots. So maybe we just leave it as the cube root of (4/7) or expressed as 4^{1/3}:7^{1/3}?

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Wait, let me check if I did all the steps correctly.

Starting from Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/GM) * D³. Since all planets are orbiting the same star, M is constant, so P² ∝ D³. Therefore, D ∝ P^(2/3). Correct.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). Since albedo a is the same, L is the same (same star), so T ∝ D^(-1/2). Therefore, T ∝ D^(-1/2) ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). Therefore, T ∝ 1/P^(1/3). Hence, the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (3.5/2)^(-1/3) = (7/4)^(-1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). So that's correct. So the ratio is the cube root of 4/7. If we rationalize, that's approximately 0.7937. But since they probably want an exact answer, we need to write it as a ratio involving cube roots. So the ratio of T4 to T2 is the cube root of 4 divided by the cube root of 7. Alternatively, written as 4^{1/3} : 7^{1/3}. So in boxed notation, that would be \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

Wait, but let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Starting from T ∝ D^(-1/2). Since D ∝ P^(2/3), then substituting, T ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). Therefore, yes, T is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Therefore, T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (7/4)^(-1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). Correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider the flux from the star, which goes as 1/D², and the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (flux)^(1/4), so (1/D²)^(1/4) = D^(-1/2). So that's the same as before. So yes, T ∝ D^(-1/2). So that's correct.

Therefore, the ratio is indeed (4/7)^(1/3). So that's the answer. I think that's right. Let me just check if there's any other factor I might have missed. Since they are in orbital resonance, but does that affect the calculation? The problem says they are in orbital resonance, but the periods are given as ratios. So probably, the resonance is already accounted for in the period ratios. So we don't need to do anything else with the resonance. The given period ratios are exact, so we can use them directly. So no, the resonance just tells us that their periods are in integer ratios, but here the ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Hmm, 2.5 and 3.5 are not integers, but maybe the resonances are in some multiple. For example, maybe the periods are in ratios of 2:4:5:7:10, which would correspond to 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 when divided by 2. But the problem states the ratio as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, so we just take those as given. So Planet_4 is 3.5, Planet_2 is 2. So the ratio is 3.5/2. So as above.

Therefore, the answer should be the cube root of 4/7. So boxed, \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

To determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting their orbital periods in the given ratio: Planet_2 has a period of 2 units, and Planet_4 has a period of 3.5 units. Using Kepler's Third Law, which relates orbital period \( P \) to distance \( D \) as \( P^2 \propto D^3 \), we find the distance ratio \( D_4/D_2 = (P_4/P_2)^{2/3} \).

Given \( P_4/P_2 = 3.5/2 = 7/4 \), the distance ratio becomes:
\[
\frac{D_4}{D_2} = \left( \frac{7}{4} \right)^{2/3}
\]

The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (\( T \propto D^{-1/2} \)). Substituting the distance ratio into this relation, we get:
\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{D_2}{D_4} \right)^{1/2} = \left( \left( \frac{7}{4} \right)^{2/3} \right)^{-1/2} = \left( \frac{7}{4} \right)^{-1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:
\[
\boxed{\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}
\]

Let me re-examine the steps.\n\nStarting from Kepler\'s third law: P² ∝ D³. Therefore, D ∝ P^(2/3). The equilibrium temperature formula: T ∝ (L / D²)^(1/4). But since all planets are orbiting the same star, L is constant. Therefore, T ∝ D^(-1/2). Therefore, substituting D from Kepler\'s law: T ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). Therefore, T ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Therefore, the ratio T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). That\'s correct.

Wait, but the periods are 3.5 and 2, which are 7/2 and 2. So, 7/2 divided by 2 is 7/4, so the period ratio is 7/4. Then, the temperature ratio is (7/4)^{-1/3} = (4/7)^{1/3}.

Therefore, the answer is the cube root of 4 over cube root of 7, which is written as (4/7)^(1/3). Therefore, I think that\'s the correct answer. Let me check once more.\n\nAnother way: Let\'s assign variables. Let’s let the star’s luminosity be L, albedo a, and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ. The equilibrium temperature T = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). Therefore, if we take T4 / T2, that would be [ (D2 / D4)^(2) ]^(1/4) = (D2 / D4)^(1/2). But D is related to P via Kepler\'s third law: D³ ∝ P², so D ∝ P^(2/3). Therefore, D2 / D4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3). Therefore, T4 / T2 = (D2 / D4)^(1/2) = (4/7)^(2/3 * 1/2) = (4/7)^(1/3). So yes, that\'s the same result. Therefore, the ratio is indeed (4/7)^(1/3).

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai response

To determine the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that their orbital periods are in the ratio 3.5:2. Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (D), we have:

\[
P^2 \propto D^3 \implies D \propto P^{2/3}
\]

The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (D):

\[
T \propto D^{-1/2}
\]

Substituting the proportionality for D from Kepler's law into the temperature equation gives:

\[
T \propto P^{-1/3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{P_4}{P_2} \right)^{-1/3}
\]

Given the orbital periods \(P_4 = 3.5\) and \(P_2 = 2\), we substitute these values:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left( \frac{3.5}{2} \right)^{-1/3} = \left( \frac{7}{4} \right)^{-1/3} = \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}
\]

Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}
\]

# paraphrased_deepseek_completion_openai reasoning

Correct. So, the period ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is 3.5:2.

Now, applying Kepler's law, the distance ratio D4/D2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Substituting the given periods: (3.5/2)^(2/3). Let me compute that. First, 3.5 divided by 2 is 1.75. Raising 1.75 to the power of 2/3. To compute this, maybe take the cube root first, then square it. The cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.205, then squaring that gives approximately 1.452. So, D4/D2 ≈ 1.452. Therefore, since the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2) = (1/1.452)^(1/2). Let's compute that. The square root of 1.452 is approximately 1.205, so 1 divided by 1.205 is approximately 0.83. Therefore, T4/T2 ≈ 0.83. But we need to present this as a ratio. Let's convert 0.83 to a fraction. 0.83 is roughly 5/6 (since 5/6 ≈ 0.8333). Alternatively, using exact exponents: since the distance ratio is (7/4)^(2/3) (since 3.5 is 7/2, so 7/2 divided by 2 is 7/4), then D4/D2 = (7/4)^(2/3). Therefore, the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). Wait, hold on. Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to D^(-1/2), as per the formula. So if D is proportional to P^(2/3), then T is proportional to P^(-1/3). Therefore, the temperature ratio T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (3.5/2)^(-1/3) = (7/4)^(-1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). So, the ratio is the cube root of 4/7. Let me compute that. 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83, which matches the previous approximation. To express this as a ratio, we can write it as 4^(1/3) : 7^(1/3). However, since cube roots are involved, the exact ratio would be (4/7)^(1/3). But maybe the problem expects an exact expression rather than a decimal approximation. Alternatively, we can rationalize it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me re-examine the steps.

Starting from Kepler's third law: P² ∝ D³. Therefore, D ∝ P^(2/3). The equilibrium temperature formula: T ∝ (L / D²)^(1/4). But since all planets are orbiting the same star, L is constant. Therefore, T ∝ D^(-1/2). Therefore, substituting D from Kepler's law: T ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). Therefore, T ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). Therefore, the ratio T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). That's correct. So, the ratio is the cube root of (4/7), which is approximately 0.83, but in exact terms, it's (4/7)^(1/3). However, the problem asks for the ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So, T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). To present this as a ratio, we can write it as 4^(1/3) : 7^(1/3). But maybe they want it in terms of integers? However, 4 and 7 are both to the power of 1/3, so perhaps we can't simplify further. Alternatively, the problem might expect a simplified ratio based on periods.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality. Let me check again.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). Since L, a, π, σ are constants here, T ∝ D^(-1/2). So, yes, T is inversely proportional to the square root of D. Then, since D ∝ P^(2/3) from Kepler's law, T ∝ (P^(2/3))^(-1/2) = P^(-1/3). Therefore, T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^(-1/3) = (3.5 / 2)^(-1/3) = (7/4)^(-1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3). So that's correct.

Alternatively, if the answer expects a rational ratio, maybe there's a step I missed. But given that the periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, which are not all integers but include decimals, perhaps the answer is meant to be expressed as the cube root of (4/7), which is approximately 0.83, but since the problem states "ratio" and they might want an exact form in terms of fractions or exponents. However, in exams or textbooks, sometimes they prefer to write ratios in terms of radicals. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express this ratio using the original period ratios without cube roots?

Wait, let me check the problem again. It says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2". So, if the ratio is (4/7)^(1/3), then that's the exact value. But perhaps we can write it as 4^{1/3}:7^{1/3}, but since these are both irrational, maybe the problem expects it in terms of the original period ratios. Wait, but the periods are 3.5 and 2, which are 7/2 and 2. So, 7/2 divided by 2 is 7/4, so the period ratio is 7/4. Then, the temperature ratio is (7/4)^{-1/3} = (4/7)^{1/3}. So, the answer is the cube root of 4/7. Therefore, the ratio of temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\left(\dfrac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}}.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a numerical ratio? But given that 4 and 7 are coprime, and the cube roots can't be simplified, that's the simplest exact form. Therefore, the answer is the cube root of 4 over cube root of 7, which is written as (4/7)^(1/3). Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. Let me check once more.

Another way: Let's assign variables. Let’s let the star’s luminosity be L, albedo a, and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ. The equilibrium temperature T = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). Therefore, if we take T4 / T2, that would be [ (D2 / D4)^(2) ]^(1/4) = (D2 / D4)^(1/2). But D is related to P via Kepler's third law: D³ ∝ P², so D ∝ P^(2/3). Therefore, D2 / D4 = (P2 / P4)^(2/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3). Therefore, T4 / T2 = (D2 / D4)^(1/2) = (4/7)^(2/3 * 1/2) = (4/7)^(1/3). So yes, that's the same result. Therefore, the ratio is indeed (4/7)^(1/3). So, the answer is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.

**Final Answer**
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is \boxed{\left( \dfrac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3}}.
